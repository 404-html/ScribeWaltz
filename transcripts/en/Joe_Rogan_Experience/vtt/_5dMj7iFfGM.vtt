1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.970
<v Speaker 1>Must be from New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2
00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.710
<v Speaker 1>Well you could definitely tell that</v>
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>

3
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.360
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two.</v>

4
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:08.800
<v Speaker 1>And we're live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Joseph,</v>

5
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.190
<v Speaker 1>how are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is like,</v>

6
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm excited and I'm excited to for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it could set a nice precedent</v>

7
00:00:16.501 --> 00:00:21.501
<v Speaker 1>because there's so much fucking toxic</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy between vegans and non vegans.</v>

8
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.370
<v Speaker 1>Even if we're just joking around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people get so fucking angry and it's not</v>

9
00:00:26.371 --> 00:00:27.204
<v Speaker 1>necessary.</v>

10
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:28.730
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

11
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.160
<v Speaker 2>where's the humor?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where's the comedy?</v>

12
00:00:31.161 --> 00:00:32.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

13
00:00:32.241 --> 00:00:37.160
<v Speaker 2>the other thing is I don't sit around</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm not defined by what the fuck I</v>

14
00:00:37.161 --> 00:00:37.994
<v Speaker 2>eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

15
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.370
<v Speaker 2>like this dude said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how come you don't call yourself a</v>

16
00:00:40.371 --> 00:00:41.040
<v Speaker 2>Vegan?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

17
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.040
<v Speaker 2>because I do a lot more shit than just</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat plant based food is part of what I</v>

18
00:00:46.131 --> 00:00:46.490
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

19
00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:47.780
<v Speaker 1>But don't you call yourself a Vegan?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Me.</v>

20
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:48.680
<v Speaker 1>You are a Vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

21
00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:53.100
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I practiced that a lifestyle for sure.</v>

22
00:00:53.101 --> 00:00:55.090
<v Speaker 2>But I don't call myself a Vegan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

23
00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.920
<v Speaker 2>that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say people say,</v>

24
00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.090
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

25
00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.620
<v Speaker 2>how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like to put any type of material</v>

26
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.850
<v Speaker 2>laid label on myself and if somebody</v>
<v Speaker 2>says to me and push the issue,</v>

27
00:01:09.111 --> 00:01:12.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm more of a higher Krishna Bhakti Yoga</v>

28
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.620
<v Speaker 2>person than I am a Vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

29
00:01:15.621 --> 00:01:17.870
<v Speaker 2>even though I don't wear animal</v>
<v Speaker 2>products,</v>

30
00:01:17.871 --> 00:01:21.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't use animal products.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I eat a plant based diet,</v>

31
00:01:21.291 --> 00:01:22.990
<v Speaker 2>100 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

32
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.520
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to call myself,</v>

33
00:01:25.521 --> 00:01:28.730
<v Speaker 2>that just puts me in some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

34
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.380
<v Speaker 2>some shelf,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

35
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.780
<v Speaker 2>it's just another Vegan or whatever the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

36
00:01:32.781 --> 00:01:33.614
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

37
00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.870
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me as though people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>always searching for an identity and if</v>

38
00:01:37.871 --> 00:01:41.020
<v Speaker 1>they have an identity that I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a carnivore,</v>

39
00:01:41.021 --> 00:01:43.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the carnivore diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has all the latest trends and then</v>

40
00:01:43.991 --> 00:01:47.500
<v Speaker 1>people get really hopped up on that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all they want to do is talk</v>

41
00:01:47.501 --> 00:01:51.760
<v Speaker 1>carnivore diet to the difference between</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's happening right now with this</v>

42
00:01:51.761 --> 00:01:55.240
<v Speaker 1>carnivore diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And vegans seems very similar to me in</v>

43
00:01:55.241 --> 00:01:57.580
<v Speaker 1>that they're very into the identity of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their food,</v>

44
00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.880
<v Speaker 1>not their food choices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but certainly into the fact that this is</v>

45
00:02:00.881 --> 00:02:03.850
<v Speaker 1>how they identify.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They talk about it all the time and I</v>

46
00:02:03.851 --> 00:02:06.730
<v Speaker 1>just think this photo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's pitfalls in that.</v>

47
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.180
<v Speaker 1>There's traps that people fall into</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they lock their identity into a</v>

48
00:02:10.181 --> 00:02:11.500
<v Speaker 1>group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

49
00:02:11.501 --> 00:02:13.910
<v Speaker 1>And this is what happens with vegans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it happens to hunters.</v>

50
00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.990
<v Speaker 1>It happens with Republicans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>happens with Democrats.</v>

51
00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.400
<v Speaker 1>It just becomes a group thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you automatically oppose</v>

52
00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:22.750
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other group,</v>

53
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.780
<v Speaker 1>and you have like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a conflict with them,</v>

54
00:02:25.781 --> 00:02:26.614
<v Speaker 1>you have hate with them.</v>

55
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.370
<v Speaker 2>Do we need more walls?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't need more adults.</v>

56
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.730
<v Speaker 2>And I'll tell you what really got it for</v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

57
00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.910
<v Speaker 2>And I started doing this in [inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 2>81 before anybody.</v>

58
00:02:34.911 --> 00:02:39.911
<v Speaker 2>I came out of incarceration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I came out of abusive foster homes.</v>

59
00:02:40.161 --> 00:02:44.330
<v Speaker 2>My father was a professional fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tried to murder my mom,</v>

60
00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.790
<v Speaker 2>peter continuously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even find out I,</v>

61
00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I was conceived that of a rape from</v>

62
00:02:50.031 --> 00:02:53.060
<v Speaker 2>him on my mom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So getting locked up,</v>

63
00:02:53.061 --> 00:02:58.061
<v Speaker 2>hitting the streets and then meeting the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad brains in 1980 and seeing them and</v>

64
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.650
<v Speaker 2>who they were surrounded by.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a lot of uh,</v>

65
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who were into very metaphysical</v>

66
00:03:06.221 --> 00:03:09.610
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I got into the yoga and I know you've</v>

67
00:03:09.611 --> 00:03:13.090
<v Speaker 2>been doing yoga now too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one of the first tenants of the yoga</v>

68
00:03:13.091 --> 00:03:15.710
<v Speaker 2>practice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which slams all it ish.</v>

69
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.660
<v Speaker 2>All this label shit is a Hump Brahmasmi</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I'm actually,</v>

70
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.120
<v Speaker 2>my identity is a spirit soul.</v>

71
00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.400
<v Speaker 2>It beyond anything in the material</v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

72
00:03:24.401 --> 00:03:29.110
<v Speaker 2>any label you want to put on yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's really where I come from with</v>

73
00:03:29.111 --> 00:03:33.280
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think the toxicity level that is</v>

74
00:03:33.281 --> 00:03:36.000
<v Speaker 2>existing now just because of what people</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking,</v>

75
00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>choose to eat.</v>

76
00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:42.270
<v Speaker 2>I mean I have my issues with a certain</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that are being done because of,</v>

77
00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.340
<v Speaker 2>because of the condition of the planet</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're not being good custodians of</v>

78
00:03:48.431 --> 00:03:52.330
<v Speaker 2>this planet that were in charge for kids</v>
<v Speaker 2>and future generations.</v>

79
00:03:52.331 --> 00:03:56.530
<v Speaker 2>What's being done now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's industries that are destroying</v>

80
00:03:56.531 --> 00:03:58.010
<v Speaker 2>the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

81
00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of it is irreparable damage being</v>

82
00:04:01.811 --> 00:04:04.600
<v Speaker 2>done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I really try to keep it</v>

83
00:04:04.601 --> 00:04:06.040
<v Speaker 2>metaphysical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

84
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.740
<v Speaker 2>with everything I do and who I help.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

85
00:04:08.741 --> 00:04:10.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm working on a documentary right now</v>
<v Speaker 2>at here,</v>

86
00:04:10.931 --> 00:04:15.160
<v Speaker 2>30 year life with hardcore fucking ex</v>
<v Speaker 2>cons.</v>

87
00:04:15.161 --> 00:04:17.920
<v Speaker 2>I just did 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>25 years,</v>

88
00:04:17.921 --> 00:04:18.550
<v Speaker 2>30 years.</v>

89
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:22.030
<v Speaker 2>If I go in there trying to preach them</v>
<v Speaker 2>some Vegan shit to them,</v>

90
00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:23.500
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm coming out.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yo,</v>

92

<v Speaker 2>this is where I've been.</v>

93
00:04:26.021 --> 00:04:27.250
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been where you are.</v>

94
00:04:27.251 --> 00:04:29.900
<v Speaker 2>People helped me and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm here to help you.</v>

95
00:04:29.901 --> 00:04:31.330
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we didn't start out.</v>

96
00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.580
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't even say,</v>

97
00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:34.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we said,</v>

98
00:04:34.951 --> 00:04:36.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to put you on a plant based</v>

99
00:04:36.851 --> 00:04:38.710
<v Speaker 2>Diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you going to do?</v>

100
00:04:38.711 --> 00:04:41.080
<v Speaker 2>Tell them don't wear leather.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking shoes.</v>

101
00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:42.160
<v Speaker 2>Don't do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't,</v>

102
00:04:42.161 --> 00:04:46.480
<v Speaker 2>do you know the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even when Jay z and beyonce is never</v>

103
00:04:46.481 --> 00:04:47.920
<v Speaker 2>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

104
00:04:47.921 --> 00:04:51.070
<v Speaker 2>They went and did you know they said</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vegan,</v>

105
00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:52.031
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

106
00:04:52.031 --> 00:04:54.980
<v Speaker 2>We were practicing a Vegan Diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're doing a 30 day Vegan.</v>

107
00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.200
<v Speaker 2>So what are the vegans do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Attack them all,</v>

108
00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.210
<v Speaker 2>but he fucking leather and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be able to find the spark.</v>

109
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.900
<v Speaker 2>So if you see some goodness in someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be able to fan that spark,</v>

110
00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.470
<v Speaker 2>not throw water on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the problem that's being done</v>

111
00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:15.490
<v Speaker 2>is people are so judgmental because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've built this walls,</v>

112
00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:20.640
<v Speaker 2>the walls between them that um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just for finding.</v>

113
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.410
<v Speaker 2>And I was telling the guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I trained them this morning,</v>

114
00:05:23.411 --> 00:05:27.460
<v Speaker 2>we're doing this 30 to life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We kipp in Anniston and we're at the</v>

115
00:05:27.461 --> 00:05:29.680
<v Speaker 2>amity foundation where these guys got</v>
<v Speaker 2>paroled.</v>

116
00:05:29.681 --> 00:05:30.341
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

117
00:05:30.341 --> 00:05:32.500
<v Speaker 2>there's two types of mentality in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

118
00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.040
<v Speaker 2>There's the Bema mentality that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking for the sweet and the good in</v>

119
00:05:36.041 --> 00:05:38.270
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's the flies and they</v>

120
00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.630
<v Speaker 2>looking for the shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

121
00:05:40.631 --> 00:05:45.631
<v Speaker 2>when you see shit on a sidewalk and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>dog takes a shit or in New York,</v>

122
00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:47.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

123
00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.670
<v Speaker 2>a human takes a shared within a matter</v>
<v Speaker 2>of fucking 20 seconds.</v>

124
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:56.200
<v Speaker 2>There's flies on that motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I try to roll with the PMA,</v>

125
00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.110
<v Speaker 2>which I learned from bad brains,</v>
<v Speaker 2>positive mental attitude,</v>

126
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.790
<v Speaker 2>which Napoleon Hill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her copped it from Napoleon Hill,</v>

127

<v Speaker 2>on self out.</v>

128
00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:12.200

<v Speaker 2>what circumstances you may be in.</v>

129
00:06:12.201 --> 00:06:16.060
<v Speaker 2>And I was in the navy at the time in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Norfork fucking smuggling,</v>

<v Speaker 2>going back to jail.</v>

132
00:06:21.021 --> 00:06:23.060
<v Speaker 2>And I was fucking up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what to do.</v>

133
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:28.040
<v Speaker 2>Fuck out of my mind hanging out with</v>
<v Speaker 2>Henry rollins and Ian Mci and all those</v>

134
00:06:28.041 --> 00:06:32.660
<v Speaker 2>guys in the DC hardcore scene in New</v>
<v Speaker 2>York punk scene and you know,</v>

135
00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.480
<v Speaker 2>hanging with John Belushi on fear that</v>
<v Speaker 2>night.</v>

136
00:06:35.481 --> 00:06:38.510
<v Speaker 2>We were the ones that wreck the set of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Saturday night live and just,</v>

137
00:06:38.511 --> 00:06:40.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the just doing crazy shit.</v>

138
00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.130
<v Speaker 2>And he was just told me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

139
00:06:43.131 --> 00:06:45.020
<v Speaker 2>whatever you may be going through in</v>
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

140
00:06:45.021 --> 00:06:48.770
<v Speaker 2>if you keep a positive mental attitude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could get through anything.</v>

141
00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.740
<v Speaker 2>So how am I going to criticize people</v>
<v Speaker 2>just because,</v>

142
00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:52.921
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

143
00:06:52.921 --> 00:06:55.220
<v Speaker 2>you eat meat or do whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

144
00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:57.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and some of these people are hardcore</v>

145
00:06:57.831 --> 00:06:59.840
<v Speaker 2>Christians and it's like you're supposed</v>
<v Speaker 2>to say,</v>

146
00:06:59.841 --> 00:07:00.351
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

147
00:07:00.351 --> 00:07:01.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hate the sin,</v>

148
00:07:01.431 --> 00:07:04.880
<v Speaker 2>not the sinner or whatever the fuck that</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole philosophy deals with.</v>

149
00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:09.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my point is I'm trying to knock down the</v>

150
00:07:09.051 --> 00:07:11.650
<v Speaker 2>walls between people and unify people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

151
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:16.010
<v Speaker 3>I think what you do good is you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a very positive role model in</v>

152
00:07:16.011 --> 00:07:18.360
<v Speaker 3>terms of hard work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in terms of your,</v>

153
00:07:18.361 --> 00:07:20.870
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your mental fortitude and how you</v>

154
00:07:20.871 --> 00:07:23.990
<v Speaker 3>approach things and I think people need</v>
<v Speaker 3>that and I think one of the things</v>

155
00:07:23.991 --> 00:07:27.500
<v Speaker 3>that's going on right now with social</v>
<v Speaker 3>media and one of the reasons why people</v>

156
00:07:27.501 --> 00:07:30.020
<v Speaker 3>will attack Jay z four and leather</v>
<v Speaker 3>shoes,</v>

157
00:07:30.021 --> 00:07:32.330
<v Speaker 3>even though they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're looking to stand out,</v>

158
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:35.030
<v Speaker 3>they're looking to be virtuous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're looking to be the person that's</v>

159
00:07:35.031 --> 00:07:37.400
<v Speaker 3>more virtuous than the person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're pointing a finger at,</v>

160
00:07:37.401 --> 00:07:38.300
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck them.</v>

161
00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:42.050
<v Speaker 3>And there's always a lot of fuck people</v>
<v Speaker 3>who aren't this or fuck people who</v>

162
00:07:42.051 --> 00:07:44.330
<v Speaker 3>aren't that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She'd never say fuck people because</v>

163
00:07:44.331 --> 00:07:46.430
<v Speaker 3>people are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just like you.</v>

164
00:07:46.431 --> 00:07:48.680
<v Speaker 3>They're human beings and everybody's on</v>
<v Speaker 3>a different path.</v>

165
00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:51.230
<v Speaker 3>Tell me why you believe the way you</v>
<v Speaker 3>believe.</v>

166
00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:53.900
<v Speaker 3>Tell me why you think the way you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'll tell you why.</v>

167
00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:57.290
<v Speaker 3>I think the way I think and I bet we'll</v>
<v Speaker 3>find common ground and that's what human</v>

168
00:07:57.291 --> 00:08:00.440
<v Speaker 3>beings need to do more with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem with social media is it</v>

169
00:08:00.441 --> 00:08:04.490
<v Speaker 3>gives us this them this unusual platform</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get people to pay attention to their</v>

170
00:08:04.491 --> 00:08:07.670
<v Speaker 3>ideas when maybe their ideas aren't even</v>
<v Speaker 3>that good or maybe their ideas are very</v>

171
00:08:07.671 --> 00:08:08.570
<v Speaker 3>obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

172
00:08:08.571 --> 00:08:10.430
<v Speaker 3>like you're gonna appointed someone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

173
00:08:10.431 --> 00:08:12.650
<v Speaker 3>you know you shouldn't say this word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey man,</v>

174
00:08:12.651 --> 00:08:16.730
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't do this thing because that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've decided that that's a bad thing.</v>

175
00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:20.050
<v Speaker 3>We've decided that that's culturally</v>
<v Speaker 3>unacceptable anymore and now everyone's</v>

176
00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:24.140
<v Speaker 3>gonna attack for that very reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Instead of describing how they feel,</v>

177
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:26.300
<v Speaker 3>what makes them feel when they say</v>
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

178
00:08:26.301 --> 00:08:28.340
<v Speaker 3>what makes them feel when they do</v>
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

179
00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:31.640
<v Speaker 3>where what's going on in their head so</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can all relate on common ground.</v>

180
00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:36.880
<v Speaker 3>People just want to attack and it's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>big problem with social media is way too</v>

181
00:08:37.701 --> 00:08:40.430
<v Speaker 3>young.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a new thing and people are using it</v>

182
00:08:40.431 --> 00:08:42.860
<v Speaker 3>and he's really fucked up ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't exactly know what they're</v>

183
00:08:42.861 --> 00:08:45.920
<v Speaker 3>doing while they're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not even aware of the effect of</v>

184
00:08:45.921 --> 00:08:47.630
<v Speaker 3>their printed word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's going to have.</v>

185
00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:51.050
<v Speaker 3>That's why you have so many trolls and</v>
<v Speaker 3>so many mean people and so many people</v>

186
00:08:51.051 --> 00:08:52.490
<v Speaker 3>just trying to get a rise out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone.</v>

187
00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:55.830
<v Speaker 3>They're not even aware of the process</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're setting in motion.</v>

188
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.830
<v Speaker 2>They just know they could push a button</v>
<v Speaker 2>and watch something happened that just</v>

189
00:08:58.831 --> 00:08:59.664
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

190
00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:02.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a lot of what's going on today.</v>

191
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:04.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and some of this stuff is,</v>

192
00:09:04.761 --> 00:09:07.650
<v Speaker 2>is destroying people's lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they fucking do.</v>

193
00:09:07.651 --> 00:09:09.390
<v Speaker 2>And they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't realize that,</v>

194
00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:11.610
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

195
00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.790
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a shame because,</v>

196
00:09:13.791 --> 00:09:15.510
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when I was growing up,</v>

197
00:09:15.511 --> 00:09:18.210
<v Speaker 2>we didn't have social media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was no motherfucking Internet,</v>

198
00:09:18.211 --> 00:09:19.410
<v Speaker 2>there was no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>none of you know,</v>

199
00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:24.440
<v Speaker 2>I remember I had the first pager.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was fucking gigantic.</v>

200
00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:27.000
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we didn't even have no internet.</v>

201
00:09:27.001 --> 00:09:30.660
<v Speaker 2>Everything was word of mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you wanted to catch shows,</v>

202
00:09:30.661 --> 00:09:33.780
<v Speaker 2>if you wanted to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you had a beef with somebody,</v>

203
00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:37.710
<v Speaker 2>you didn't go on fucking social media</v>
<v Speaker 2>and talk a bunch of bullshit,</v>

204
00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:40.680
<v Speaker 2>you fucking walked up to the person and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you said,</v>

205
00:09:40.681 --> 00:09:42.840
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here I am and what the fuck,</v>

206
00:09:42.841 --> 00:09:44.340
<v Speaker 2>let's let's deal with this.</v>

207
00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:45.930
<v Speaker 2>Let's talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk it out.</v>

208
00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:49.420
<v Speaker 2>But now you got people buying followers</v>
<v Speaker 2>and do another.</v>

209
00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:52.290
<v Speaker 2>It's just that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

210
00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:56.340
<v Speaker 2>it's just the most toxic environment in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of ways.</v>

211
00:09:56.341 --> 00:09:58.440
<v Speaker 2>And it's a shame because it could be</v>
<v Speaker 2>used.</v>

212
00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:01.650
<v Speaker 2>And that's why I never post negative</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

213
00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:04.410
<v Speaker 2>I tried to use the platform,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

214
00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:06.850

<v Speaker 2>up your ass.</v>

<v Speaker 2>plant based Vegan thing and everything</v>

349
00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:47.080
<v Speaker 2>I would fight the black dudes and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>would just beat the shit out of me,</v>

350
00:15:47.081 --> 00:15:49.480
<v Speaker 2>but I would just keep coming back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

351
00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:51.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm Irish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't quit man.</v>

352
00:15:51.141 --> 00:15:52.910
<v Speaker 2>I was [inaudible] then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

353
00:15:52.911 --> 00:15:56.390
<v Speaker 2>I learned more of the sweet science and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

354
00:15:56.391 --> 00:15:59.910
<v Speaker 2>went into the navy and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you quit smoking just for boxing.</v>

355
00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:02.030
<v Speaker 2>I quit smoking A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

356
00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:03.050
<v Speaker 2>for that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for that reason.</v>

357
00:16:03.051 --> 00:16:07.160
<v Speaker 2>But when I was locked up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't quit almost to the end because</v>

358
00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:12.410
<v Speaker 2>towards the end of your sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they allow you to go home because they</v>

359
00:16:12.411 --> 00:16:15.230
<v Speaker 2>want to reintegrate you back with your</v>
<v Speaker 2>family or whatever.</v>

360
00:16:15.231 --> 00:16:17.630
<v Speaker 2>And I never grew up with my mom so they</v>
<v Speaker 2>would send us home.</v>

361
00:16:17.631 --> 00:16:21.620
<v Speaker 2>So we would take the continent</v>
<v Speaker 2>cigarettes and opening up very</v>

362
00:16:21.621 --> 00:16:23.300
<v Speaker 2>carefully,</v>
<v Speaker 2>open up the cellophane,</v>

363
00:16:23.301 --> 00:16:28.301
<v Speaker 2>carefully slide the cellophane down and</v>
<v Speaker 2>put joints inside the cigarette pack,</v>

364
00:16:28.371 --> 00:16:31.250
<v Speaker 2>slide it back up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>glue it closed the cart and cigarettes.</v>

365
00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:35.720
<v Speaker 2>And that's how we would get the feedback</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the visits because I wasn't smoking</v>

366
00:16:35.721 --> 00:16:37.520
<v Speaker 2>weed coming back out of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's asked.</v>

367
00:16:37.521 --> 00:16:39.160
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

368
00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:40.003
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank you.</v>

369
00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:41.830
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

370
00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:42.471
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

371
00:16:42.471 --> 00:16:45.650
<v Speaker 2>so that was the process and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

372
00:16:45.651 --> 00:16:47.180
<v Speaker 2>so that's why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why I quit.</v>

373
00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:50.040
<v Speaker 2>But that's the book came,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

374
00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:54.350
<v Speaker 2>I had a lot of shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of demons inside of me from what</v>

375
00:16:54.351 --> 00:16:57.300
<v Speaker 2>happened to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>me and my two brothers was,</v>

376
00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:00.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty severely abused and all kinds of</v>

377
00:17:00.771 --> 00:17:02.510
<v Speaker 2>ways in his foster home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>physically,</v>

378
00:17:02.511 --> 00:17:05.870
<v Speaker 2>mentally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexually abused by the older kids in the</v>

379
00:17:05.871 --> 00:17:06.290
<v Speaker 2>home.</v>

380
00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:09.440
<v Speaker 2>It was fucked up and I never told</v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody,</v>

381
00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:14.240
<v Speaker 2>but that was always something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter how much I lived as a monk for</v>

382
00:17:14.241 --> 00:17:16.910
<v Speaker 2>two years or Hari Krishna Monk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing,</v>

383
00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:20.570
<v Speaker 2>a cure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that fucking anger that was inside of me</v>

384
00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:22.970
<v Speaker 2>that I had toward these people for what</v>
<v Speaker 2>they did to me.</v>

385
00:17:22.971 --> 00:17:24.590
<v Speaker 2>And the secret of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yo,</v>

386
00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:26.500
<v Speaker 2>it's fucked up to say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yo,</v>

387
00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:26.931
<v Speaker 2>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yo,</v>

388
00:17:26.931 --> 00:17:30.530
<v Speaker 2>just do from the streets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You had knife fights with Puerto Rican.</v>

389
00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:33.590
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got shot with a 22 and forest parks on</v>

390
00:17:33.591 --> 00:17:36.350
<v Speaker 2>angel dust.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got stabbed and then to try to say,</v>

391
00:17:36.351 --> 00:17:39.080
<v Speaker 2>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this motherfucker molesting me is wwe.</v>

392
00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:42.890
<v Speaker 2>It took a lot out of me too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And nobody knew it because I never</v>

393
00:17:42.891 --> 00:17:46.880
<v Speaker 2>talked about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I took my keys class and that was</v>

394
00:17:46.881 --> 00:17:50.190
<v Speaker 2>the turning point because I went up to</v>
<v Speaker 2>him and I was writing a script at the</v>

395
00:17:50.191 --> 00:17:52.680
<v Speaker 2>time based on what happened to me in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>foster home.</v>

396
00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:56.250
<v Speaker 2>The kids in the screenplay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We based,</v>

397
00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:57.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

398
00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:58.980
<v Speaker 2>what happened to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

399
00:17:58.981 --> 00:18:00.360
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my younger,</v>

400
00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:04.920
<v Speaker 2>a period of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I never told anybody what happened.</v>

401
00:18:04.921 --> 00:18:06.840
<v Speaker 2>I would just avoid that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then when I wrote,</v>

402
00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:12.000
<v Speaker 2>I started writing the book and I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking his class and between,</v>

403
00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:13.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

404
00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:15.570
<v Speaker 2>parts of his thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you went on a break,</v>

405
00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:17.880
<v Speaker 2>you could walk up to Robert Mckee and</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

406
00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:20.190
<v Speaker 2>ask him questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I said,</v>

407
00:18:20.191 --> 00:18:25.191
<v Speaker 2>Mr Mckee as far as a protagonist who was</v>
<v Speaker 2>abused as a kid and he stopped me right</v>

408
00:18:25.651 --> 00:18:27.360
<v Speaker 2>there and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

409
00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:29.070
<v Speaker 2>stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right Day said McGowan,</v>

410
00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:32.220
<v Speaker 2>everybody uses it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a cliche,</v>

411
00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:34.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>abusive children,</v>

412
00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:37.440
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to develop empathy for characters we</v>

413
00:18:37.441 --> 00:18:41.850
<v Speaker 2>could otherwise not give a fuck about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not what happens to somebody,</v>

414
00:18:41.851 --> 00:18:45.810
<v Speaker 2>it's what they do as a result of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the fucking light came on.</v>

415
00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:48.630
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for years I would sit there and it took</v>

416
00:18:48.631 --> 00:18:52.590
<v Speaker 2>me seven years to write the evolution of</v>
<v Speaker 2>a cro magnon and I would get to that</v>

417
00:18:52.591 --> 00:18:57.591
<v Speaker 2>part of the story and I will lose my</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit and break down crying like fucking</v>

418
00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:02.190
<v Speaker 2>uncontrollably because of what happened</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me and my brothers.</v>

419
00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:07.260
<v Speaker 2>So I just skipped over that part and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>would never address it.</v>

420
00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:09.270
<v Speaker 2>But then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

421
00:19:09.271 --> 00:19:12.360
<v Speaker 2>he gave me the strength and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>ways to be able to say,</v>

422
00:19:12.361 --> 00:19:14.070
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to tee.</v>

423
00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:17.880
<v Speaker 2>He wrote in my book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I have his book and he wrote to me,</v>

424
00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:21.690
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>John always write the truth and that's</v>

425
00:19:21.691 --> 00:19:26.610
<v Speaker 2>when I knew that that needed to come out</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the book to cleanse myself.</v>

426
00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:30.720
<v Speaker 2>I've been two years on crack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a 88,</v>

427
00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:35.370
<v Speaker 2>88 to 90 crack pills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

428
00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:40.200
<v Speaker 2>doing whatever getting shot at with</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking ear fifteens robin deals.</v>

429
00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:43.500
<v Speaker 2>I had a tos or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was chaos at the time,</v>

430
00:19:43.501 --> 00:19:44.520
<v Speaker 2>kill on site.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

431
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.300
<v Speaker 2>I was a fucking maniac because I just</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't care.</v>

432
00:19:48.301 --> 00:19:52.470
<v Speaker 2>I actually kind of wish subconsciously</v>
<v Speaker 2>that somebody would put a fucking bullet</v>

433
00:19:52.471 --> 00:19:55.030
<v Speaker 2>at me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're doing crack.</v>

434
00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:59.070
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people get molested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They almost act out to the point where</v>

435
00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:01.530
<v Speaker 2>they want someone else to do it for them</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they don't want to.</v>

436
00:20:01.531 --> 00:20:03.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was definitely in a lot of ways that's</v>

437
00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:07.740
<v Speaker 2>what I was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when I took a his,</v>

438
00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:11.940
<v Speaker 2>when that seminar helped me so much</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's really like,</v>

439
00:20:11.941 --> 00:20:15.420
<v Speaker 2>he's really like a fucking a guru and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>teacher man.</v>

440
00:20:15.421 --> 00:20:19.380
<v Speaker 2>The man is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you ever get a chance to take the</v>

443
00:20:22.441 --> 00:20:24.660

<v Speaker 2>But the story seminar,</v>

444
00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:28.290
<v Speaker 2>I just walked out of there after the</v>
<v Speaker 2>third day is 10 hours a day and you're</v>

<v Speaker 2>tell my story the right way and the</v>

<v Speaker 2>You will become a pussy dependent on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>pharmaceutical companies to keep you</v>

475
00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:50.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

476
00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:53.730
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>initially my first and my first</v>

477
00:21:53.731 --> 00:21:56.880
<v Speaker 2>interaction with Rastafarian's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was 1980.</v>

478
00:21:57.150 --> 00:22:00.030
<v Speaker 2>So I went to my ship was going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamaica.</v>

479
00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:03.620
<v Speaker 2>So when you go to any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you go take this,</v>

480
00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:07.410
<v Speaker 2>let's say you go to any port and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>take you down on the mess deck and they</v>

481
00:22:07.411 --> 00:22:08.700
<v Speaker 2>show everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go here,</v>

482
00:22:08.701 --> 00:22:09.630
<v Speaker 2>you go there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

483
00:22:09.631 --> 00:22:12.570
<v Speaker 2>they show you these films.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when we were getting ready to go to</v>

484
00:22:12.571 --> 00:22:13.404
<v Speaker 2>Jamaica,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

485
00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:16.560
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to use,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's these like military films from</v>

486
00:22:16.561 --> 00:22:18.450
<v Speaker 2>like the sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're gonna use,</v>

487
00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:20.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

488
00:22:20.011 --> 00:22:23.670

<v Speaker 2>you use a prophylactic.</v>

489
00:22:23.671 --> 00:22:28.671
<v Speaker 2>And then the next photo was a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rastafari in with smoke coming out of</v>

490
00:22:29.221 --> 00:22:31.980
<v Speaker 2>every fucking or FIS.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>

491
00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:35.850
<v Speaker 2>and under no circumstances should you</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk to these people,</v>

492
00:22:35.851 --> 00:22:38.430
<v Speaker 2>they're just going to try to sell you</v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs.</v>

493
00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:42.450
<v Speaker 2>So who the fuck do you think was the</v>
<v Speaker 2>first people I went when I got off the</v>

494
00:22:42.451 --> 00:22:45.930
<v Speaker 2>ship because I didn't hang out with like</v>
<v Speaker 2>any of the dudes on my ship.</v>

495
00:22:45.931 --> 00:22:48.130
<v Speaker 2>I got the fuck away from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was the only punk rocker.</v>

<v Speaker 2>destroy fucking tee shirts.</v>

497
00:22:51.481 --> 00:22:55.560
<v Speaker 2>They're looking at me like I was already</v>
<v Speaker 2>into punk rock since the seventies.</v>

498
00:22:56.490 --> 00:23:00.630
<v Speaker 2>So I get off the ship and I meet this</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 20 something year old fucking</v>

<v Speaker 2>up the statue.</v>

510
00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:24.210
<v Speaker 2>And then I had a hookup with uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the officer,</v>

<v Speaker 2>the ship anchored out in the bay and you</v>

518
00:23:48.591 --> 00:23:52.730
<v Speaker 2>took a boat in and landed at the dock.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

529
00:24:16.011 --> 00:24:16.701
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

530
00:24:16.701 --> 00:24:19.490
<v Speaker 2>let me check that shit out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Took one fork full.</v>

531
00:24:19.491 --> 00:24:22.460
<v Speaker 2>And I just was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fucking disgusting.</v>

532
00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:24.140
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tastes like dirt dude.</v>

533
00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:28.820
<v Speaker 2>What was it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was Carla Lou Lou Lou is a green.</v>

534
00:24:28.821 --> 00:24:31.370
<v Speaker 2>It's like one of the most nutritious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Collard Green.</v>

535
00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:33.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like Collard Green.</v>

536
00:24:33.351 --> 00:24:38.351
<v Speaker 2>It's like they have a day of Greens down</v>
<v Speaker 2>there that don't really grow anywhere</v>

537
00:24:38.421 --> 00:24:40.340
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think it's like a combination of</v>

538
00:24:40.341 --> 00:24:45.020
<v Speaker 2>Kale and Collard Greens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then Aki is like this fruit and it</v>

539
00:24:45.021 --> 00:24:48.440
<v Speaker 2>looks like it's yellow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like an egg almost.</v>

540
00:24:48.441 --> 00:24:51.290
<v Speaker 2>But if you eat Aki when it's not ripe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll die.</v>

541
00:24:51.291 --> 00:24:53.450
<v Speaker 2>You get poisoned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's this type of thing.</v>

542
00:24:53.451 --> 00:24:57.170
<v Speaker 2>Like when the fruit opens up the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a red fruit.</v>

543
00:24:57.410 --> 00:24:59.660
<v Speaker 2>If you eat it when it's not open,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will die.</v>

544
00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:00.500
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

545
00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:03.200
<v Speaker 2>Aki Aki will poison you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then.</v>

546
00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:07.400
<v Speaker 2>And then he was eating seaweed and beans</v>
<v Speaker 2>and anyway,</v>

547
00:25:07.401 --> 00:25:09.920
<v Speaker 2>so I went up into the hills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He took me.</v>

548
00:25:09.921 --> 00:25:12.470
<v Speaker 2>Now I don't know if you like reggae,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do.</v>

549
00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:15.770
<v Speaker 2>I fucking love Gregory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So do you know where Peter Tosh?</v>

550
00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:19.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm wanted shredder alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know where that came from?</v>

551
00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:20.180
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

00:25:20.181 --> 00:25:24.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So back in,</v>

553
00:25:24.501 --> 00:25:27.380

<v Speaker 2>this cop,</v>

554
00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:30.230
<v Speaker 2>they hate the roster foreigns in Jamaica</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

555
00:25:30.231 --> 00:25:33.620
<v Speaker 2>because it's a big Christian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Christians invaded that place and</v>

556
00:25:33.621 --> 00:25:38.621
<v Speaker 2>just fucking turned everybody into</v>
<v Speaker 2>dogmatic fucking thinking people to</v>

557
00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:42.890
<v Speaker 2>judo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know the what the white man does</v>

558
00:25:42.891 --> 00:25:45.500
<v Speaker 2>everywhere across the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to be my religion.</v>

559
00:25:45.501 --> 00:25:47.300
<v Speaker 2>Fuck everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what's up.</v>

560
00:25:47.301 --> 00:25:52.301
<v Speaker 2>So they did that dad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm what they call the Jamaicans.</v>

561
00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:55.820
<v Speaker 2>What the rosters called the Jamaicans</v>
<v Speaker 2>who don't grow knots.</v>

562
00:25:55.821 --> 00:25:57.560
<v Speaker 2>They call them ball heads,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

563
00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:58.760
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Bob Marley,</v>

564
00:25:58.761 --> 00:26:01.850
<v Speaker 2>crazy ball head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what they did with these guys,</v>

565
00:26:02.290 --> 00:26:03.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

566
00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:06.280
<v Speaker 2>a cop tried to kill Ross,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the foreign and the roster foreign</v>

567
00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:11.240
<v Speaker 2>killed a cop so they put a bounty on</v>
<v Speaker 2>every single Rastafari and wanted dead</v>

568
00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:14.810
<v Speaker 2>or alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could kill a roster and drag him to</v>

569
00:26:14.811 --> 00:26:19.490
<v Speaker 2>the precinct and collect a reward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all the rosters fled up into the</v>

570
00:26:19.491 --> 00:26:22.610
<v Speaker 2>hills and it was called the Greenbay</v>
<v Speaker 2>killings.</v>

<v Speaker 2>rastafarian's it.</v>

572
00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:29.750

<v Speaker 2>hills and I met these rosters and the</v>

573

00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:05.680
<v Speaker 2>shrunk down in the seat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if they would've looked up,</v>

694
00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:08.470
<v Speaker 2>that was it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't be here telling you this</v>

695
00:32:08.471 --> 00:32:12.520
<v Speaker 2>story because my life would have taken a</v>
<v Speaker 2>much different trajectory.</v>

696
00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:16.250
<v Speaker 2>So what happened was I went up and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>hitchhiked with his band,</v>

697
00:32:16.251 --> 00:32:18.910

<v Speaker 2>bobby still was an original misfits.</v>

699
00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:26.080
<v Speaker 2>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they played the 9:30 and they gave me a</v>

700
00:32:26.081 --> 00:32:31.081

<v Speaker 2>And what happened was they were playing</v>
<v Speaker 2>a show a couple of days later and</v>

704
00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:48.110

<v Speaker 2>So they calmed me down.</v>

726
00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:40.670
<v Speaker 2>But when I got outside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dude tried to stab me.</v>

727
00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:44.120
<v Speaker 2>So I blocked the knife and I hit him</v>
<v Speaker 2>with an elbow and pop out.</v>

728
00:33:44.121 --> 00:33:46.520
<v Speaker 2>Bob knocked him down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>smashed his head off the curb.</v>

729
00:33:46.521 --> 00:33:49.640
<v Speaker 2>Next thing I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four of his homies come charging at me.</v>

732
00:33:54.471 --> 00:33:57.050
<v Speaker 2>can ask Henry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all used to wear these chain belts</v>

733
00:33:57.051 --> 00:34:00.950
<v Speaker 2>with a quick release,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bike chain to fight people because in</v>

735
00:34:05.421 --> 00:34:07.970
<v Speaker 2>rockers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I got in a fight with these</v>

736
00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:12.980
<v Speaker 2>motherfuckers and I ended up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I go to run back into one 71 because</v>

00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:21.350
<v Speaker 2>These motherfuckers want to kill me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I pushed my way in.</v>

740
00:34:21.351 --> 00:34:25.280
<v Speaker 2>I got stabbed in the shoulder and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>they put out a kol on me.</v>

741
00:34:25.281 --> 00:34:26.930
<v Speaker 2>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to kill that motherfucker.</v>

742
00:34:26.931 --> 00:34:31.931
<v Speaker 2>Nobody would hang out with me except for</v>
<v Speaker 2>this one crazy Russian street fighter</v>

743
00:34:32.241 --> 00:34:34.580
<v Speaker 2>kid named James Concert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the only dude.</v>

744
00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:38.600
<v Speaker 2>So then I said I couldn't go down the</v>
<v Speaker 2>alphabet city at all.</v>

745
00:34:39.410 --> 00:34:42.330
<v Speaker 2>They were waiting there with fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>guns and bats and like,</v>

746
00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:45.590
<v Speaker 2>we're going to kill that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But because the bad brains were black,</v>

747
00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:51.040
<v Speaker 2>they kind of squashed it over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I went up there to face him and they</v>

748

<v Speaker 2>surrounded me like fucking dude was like</v>

<v Speaker 2>then they got me a job and this is where</v>

771
00:35:56.881 --> 00:35:58.260
<v Speaker 2>the Christian thing comes in.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I always come full circle.</v>

773
00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:04.710

<v Speaker 2>So they started giving us food and</v>

777
00:36:16.471 --> 00:36:20.060
<v Speaker 2>that's when I started changing over to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Diet because bad brains were like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>You got to eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tell is vitas can be fatal.</v>

781
00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:32.780
<v Speaker 2>Took me to the hell it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tell it means pure,</v>

782
00:36:33.090 --> 00:36:34.560
<v Speaker 2>pure plant based food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

783
00:36:34.610 --> 00:36:36.570
<v Speaker 2>no oil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no fucking salt.</v>

784
00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:37.740
<v Speaker 2>It's like oil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

785
00:36:37.741 --> 00:36:38.640
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This district,</v>

786
00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:41.660
<v Speaker 2>it's like the avocado oil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Coconut oil.</v>

787
00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:44.940
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you take coconut and you and you</v>

788
00:36:44.941 --> 00:36:48.480
<v Speaker 2>fucking shred it down so fine at the oil</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes out of it,</v>

789
00:36:48.481 --> 00:36:49.020
<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>

790
00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:52.650
<v Speaker 2>But they don't do processed oils.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a different thing when you</v>

791
00:36:52.651 --> 00:36:55.670
<v Speaker 2>process the oil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have health problems like what</v>

792
00:36:55.680 --> 00:37:00.680
<v Speaker 2>they proved in forks over knives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it becomes a toxic oil to the body</v>

793
00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:04.350
<v Speaker 2>and if you have any kind of heart</v>
<v Speaker 2>conditions and stuff like that,</v>

794
00:37:04.351 --> 00:37:06.450
<v Speaker 2>you should be really avoided.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>

795
00:37:06.451 --> 00:37:10.110
<v Speaker 2>what they did was they got me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were smart because they wanted me</v>

796
00:37:10.111 --> 00:37:11.820
<v Speaker 2>to give them free food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bad brains,</v>

797
00:37:11.850 --> 00:37:15.060
<v Speaker 2>and they got me in the health food store</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the dude was like,</v>

798
00:37:15.061 --> 00:37:18.900
<v Speaker 2>this hippie Yogi dude hooked up with</v>
<v Speaker 2>Satchidananda Swami.</v>

799
00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:21.690
<v Speaker 2>It was called Pronto foods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

800
00:37:21.691 --> 00:37:24.660
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to do Karma Yoga when you</v>

801
00:37:24.661 --> 00:37:26.010
<v Speaker 2>first come in here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

802
00:37:26.011 --> 00:37:28.170
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to get any money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going gonna,</v>

00:37:28.171 --> 00:37:31.440
<v Speaker 2>you know you can eat and it's Karma Yoga</v>
<v Speaker 2>is good for your Karma.</v>

804
00:37:31.890 --> 00:37:34.350
<v Speaker 2>So then I told everybody in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>motherfucking neighborhood,</v>

805
00:37:34.351 --> 00:37:35.184
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yo,</v>

806
00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:36.710

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:09.420
<v Speaker 2>So I kept trying to defeat this dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Philosophically.</v>

820
00:38:09.421 --> 00:38:10.500
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yo.</v>

<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he knew the whole philosophy of the</v>

822
00:38:12.961 --> 00:38:15.900
<v Speaker 2>Vedas and the Bhagavad Gita is where all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the yoga</v>

823
00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:22.020
<v Speaker 2>or the yoga sutras and all of that comes</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of the Bhagavad Gita and prob.</v>

824
00:38:22.021 --> 00:38:24.120
<v Speaker 2>I put out the Bhagavad Gita as it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

825
00:38:24.121 --> 00:38:26.400
<v Speaker 2>which the original Bhagavad Gita from</v>
<v Speaker 2>India.</v>

826
00:38:26.970 --> 00:38:31.290
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kept trying to defeat it all the time.</v>

827
00:38:31.291 --> 00:38:34.290
<v Speaker 2>Every day I read Bhagavad gita stream on</v>
<v Speaker 2>bog of the time.</v>

828

<v Speaker 2>Gita is a flying crafts and Soma is one</v>

840
00:39:07.541 --> 00:39:10.270
<v Speaker 2>of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone's one of the interesting things</v>

844
00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:18.220
<v Speaker 2>They think it might be a combination of</v>
<v Speaker 2>several things.</v>

00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:22.370
<v Speaker 2>They think for sure psilocybins in it,</v>

<v Speaker 2>The vedic astrology is much different</v>

850
00:39:35.651 --> 00:39:40.651
<v Speaker 2>than the western astrology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they talk about planets way above</v>

<v Speaker 2>choice celibate monk for how long?</v>

870
00:40:32.770 --> 00:40:36.340
<v Speaker 2>For two years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I trained martial arts in Hawaii and</v>

<v Speaker 2>in the morning.</v>

877
00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:59.470
<v Speaker 2>my assault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that came because when I first was</v>

878
00:40:59.471 --> 00:41:02.500
<v Speaker 2>going to the temple I wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would write down my questions.</v>

<v Speaker 2>of self realization.</v>

895

<v Speaker 2>the whole process.</v>

901
00:42:06.021 --> 00:42:06.651
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:14.240
<v Speaker 2>and it's called greeting as a dds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the song that gets played,</v>

907
00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:27.890
<v Speaker 2>Everything I've known in my life was</v>
<v Speaker 2>pain and violence and just fucking</v>

910
00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:35.660
<v Speaker 2>escape from the Pr,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the trappings of your past.</v>

911
00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:39.230
<v Speaker 2>It was a pathway to enlightenment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a pathway to peace.</v>

912
00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:44.060

<v Speaker 2>But some of the most fierce warriors.</v>

913
00:42:44.061 --> 00:42:47.270
<v Speaker 2>And what I loved about Bhagavad Gita is</v>
<v Speaker 2>spoken on a battlefield between</v>

914
00:42:47.271 --> 00:42:48.180
<v Speaker 2>Christian on Juno.</v>

917
00:42:53.421 --> 00:42:56.990
<v Speaker 2>warrior class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you read any books on martial</v>

918
00:42:56.991 --> 00:42:58.460
<v Speaker 2>arts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to tell you the martial</v>

919
00:42:58.461 --> 00:43:02.250
<v Speaker 2>arts originated in India,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the original martial arts school.</v>

920
00:43:02.251 --> 00:43:07.251
<v Speaker 2>We're all in India and at one point</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sanccob charia chased all the Buddhists</v>

921
00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:11.030
<v Speaker 2>out of India and they fled across the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Himalayas into China.</v>

922
00:43:11.031 --> 00:43:16.031
<v Speaker 2>So this is actual history that you and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see where the martial arts</v>

923
00:43:16.701 --> 00:43:20.510
<v Speaker 2>spread out across across the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

924
00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:22.240
<v Speaker 2>a lot of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

925
00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:26.870
<v Speaker 2>a lot of things that are around today</v>
<v Speaker 2>originated in India.</v>

926
00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:30.470
<v Speaker 2>So to me that really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was always in,</v>

927
00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:32.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a street fighter.</v>

928
00:43:32.810 --> 00:43:34.420
<v Speaker 2>I messed around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

929
00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:35.530
<v Speaker 2>even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

930
00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:39.050
<v Speaker 2>with some going to martial arts schools,</v>
<v Speaker 2>always on the outskirts.</v>

931
00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:43.430
<v Speaker 2>I even went and trained with Ron van</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cleef when he had his school in New</v>

932
00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:43.430
<v Speaker 2>York.</v>

933
00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:45.020
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he would,</v>

934
00:43:45.170 --> 00:43:47.330
<v Speaker 2>he would always be trained in police</v>
<v Speaker 2>forces.</v>

935
00:43:47.331 --> 00:43:51.390
<v Speaker 2>And I was the only white dude in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>class and it was all black and Puerto</v>

936
00:43:51.390 --> 00:43:52.690
<v Speaker 2>Rican.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when it came time to spot,</v>

937
00:43:52.691 --> 00:43:56.210
<v Speaker 2>they beat the shit out of me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was getting fucking wrecked by the,</v>

938
00:43:56.590 --> 00:43:57.860
<v Speaker 2>by the black belts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Byb,</v>

939
00:43:57.861 --> 00:43:58.810
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

940
00:43:58.811 --> 00:44:01.970
<v Speaker 2>I was no lights barnbrook then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No nobody water.</v>

941
00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:04.790
<v Speaker 2>There was schools,</v>
<v Speaker 2>victim Vega,</v>

942
00:44:04.910 --> 00:44:06.490
<v Speaker 2>Ron van Cleef,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ron Tag,</v>

943
00:44:06.491 --> 00:44:08.950
<v Speaker 2>and now she does do doc,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

944
00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:09.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

945
00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:12.350
<v Speaker 2>this other dude named Rodin who ran the</v>
<v Speaker 2>school,</v>

946
00:44:12.351 --> 00:44:16.550
<v Speaker 2>University of streets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would run from into the Dojo like</v>

947
00:44:16.551 --> 00:44:21.480
<v Speaker 2>20 dudes and just all out fucking Bra.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like even Brian Callahan,</v>

948
00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:26.510
<v Speaker 2>his teacher and all these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they train under master Choi and some</v>

949
00:44:26.811 --> 00:44:31.811
<v Speaker 2>them joy and he encouraged you to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are training to fight.</v>

950
00:44:32.970 --> 00:44:33.430
<v Speaker 2>Like</v>

951
00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:36.090
<v Speaker 1>it was very common back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a big part of it because you</v>

952
00:44:36.091 --> 00:44:39.510
<v Speaker 1>had to develop people that could</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually perform in competition and one</v>

953
00:44:39.511 --> 00:44:42.030
<v Speaker 1>of the best ways to do that was deaf</v>
<v Speaker 1>challenge matches.</v>

954
00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:44.430
<v Speaker 1>So like what you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smokers,</v>

955
00:44:44.730 --> 00:44:47.640
<v Speaker 1>they used to allow that in la up until</v>
<v Speaker 1>real recently,</v>

956
00:44:47.660 --> 00:44:51.180
<v Speaker 1>over the last 10 years or so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they banned smokers but used to be able</v>

957
00:44:51.181 --> 00:44:56.181
<v Speaker 1>to get your experience in actual fights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the smoker and that was a little bit</v>

958
00:44:56.460 --> 00:45:00.330
<v Speaker 1>more prepared than the Dojo storming</v>
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>

959
00:45:00.750 --> 00:45:03.060
<v Speaker 1>But the Dojo stormy days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how a lot of people go.</v>

960
00:45:03.070 --> 00:45:03.930
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And said like,</v>

961
00:45:03.931 --> 00:45:05.820
<v Speaker 1>you have real fights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would go in there,</v>

962
00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:08.340
<v Speaker 1>some guy would come from another school</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you knew you going to hit each other</v>

963
00:45:08.341 --> 00:45:09.510
<v Speaker 1>as hard as you could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't.</v>

964
00:45:09.511 --> 00:45:11.010
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't really sparring.</v>

965
00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:13.130
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you a lot of that spun into</v>

966
00:45:13.131 --> 00:45:16.580
<v Speaker 2>gang bonds too because a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that were the martial arts teacher,</v>

967
00:45:16.590 --> 00:45:18.350
<v Speaker 2>this one dude jr,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's famous.</v>

968
00:45:18.351 --> 00:45:21.470
<v Speaker 2>He was in the New York Times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was one of the biggest heroin</v>

969
00:45:21.471 --> 00:45:24.650
<v Speaker 2>traffickers on the lower east side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was one of the first guys to get</v>

970
00:45:24.651 --> 00:45:29.651
<v Speaker 2>busted onto the rico statute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did the full 25 and he trained all of</v>

971
00:45:31.401 --> 00:45:35.270
<v Speaker 2>the dudes as Sol for him and all his</v>
<v Speaker 2>street soldiers were all trained in</v>

972
00:45:35.271 --> 00:45:38.360
<v Speaker 2>martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of these guys were doing shady</v>

00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:51.600
<v Speaker 3>problem that you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1037
00:48:51.610 --> 00:48:53.270
<v Speaker 3>It's one of those things where I don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>know what to do.</v>

1038
00:48:53.590 --> 00:48:56.580
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some shenanigans,</v>

1039
00:48:56.610 --> 00:48:59.040
<v Speaker 2>but I know that it's something happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1040
00:48:59.130 --> 00:49:00.660
<v Speaker 2>I know it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it goes on,</v>

1041
00:49:00.661 --> 00:49:01.490
<v Speaker 2>something happens,</v>

1042
00:49:01.490 --> 00:49:04.250
<v Speaker 3>not just him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the list is a mile long and for</v>

1043
00:49:04.251 --> 00:49:07.040
<v Speaker 3>everybody that comes forth is a million</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that are sitting back on,</v>

1044
00:49:07.041 --> 00:49:09.850
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to say anything because I</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't want to take that shame on.</v>

1045
00:49:10.100 --> 00:49:11.420
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what happened with me.</v>

1046
00:49:11.421 --> 00:49:13.010
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was the same day like,</v>

1047
00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:14.061
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1048
00:49:14.061 --> 00:49:15.920
<v Speaker 2>you have this wrapping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck,</v>

1049
00:49:15.921 --> 00:49:18.470
<v Speaker 2>but that's all false ego.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even all of that stuff.</v>

1050
00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:22.520
<v Speaker 2>And then the person that I was with at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the time said,</v>

1051
00:49:22.521 --> 00:49:24.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this story is going to help a lot of</v>

1052
00:49:24.681 --> 00:49:29.681
<v Speaker 2>people you by you coming forward and</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying what happened to you and how</v>

1053
00:49:29.691 --> 00:49:31.810
<v Speaker 2>you're dealing with it now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what,</v>

1054
00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:34.160
<v Speaker 2>that's what I even did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got this new book,</v>

1055
00:49:34.161 --> 00:49:38.420
<v Speaker 2>the PMA effect coming out and the whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit is about healing people and help.</v>

1056
00:49:38.870 --> 00:49:41.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've helped thousands of people kicked</v>

1057
00:49:41.391 --> 00:49:44.600
<v Speaker 2>drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kick a suicidal thoughts.</v>

1058
00:49:45.010 --> 00:49:45.820
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1059
00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:47.570
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not that I'm like,</v>

1060
00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:49.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm turning him into a Vegan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1061
00:49:49.851 --> 00:49:52.540
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to show you the system that</v>

1062
00:49:52.541 --> 00:49:55.160
<v Speaker 2>worked for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all I can do is tell you,</v>

1063
00:49:55.460 --> 00:49:57.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm like the fucking mailman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1064
00:49:58.060 --> 00:50:00.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm just delivering the fucking mail to</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1065
00:50:00.321 --> 00:50:04.220
<v Speaker 2>I didn't come up with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm showing you the yoga to plant</v>

1066
00:50:04.221 --> 00:50:06.440
<v Speaker 2>based diet,</v>

1067
00:50:06.530 --> 00:50:09.530
<v Speaker 2>to training,</v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly fucking training.</v>

1068
00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:11.140
<v Speaker 3>Well through all the things you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing,</v>

1069
00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:15.190
<v Speaker 3>you're committed and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're disciplined and that's attractive</v>

1070
00:50:15.191 --> 00:50:16.001
<v Speaker 3>to people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1071
00:50:16.001 --> 00:50:19.540
<v Speaker 3>People look to for people that are doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that they wish they were doing,</v>

1072
00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:21.880
<v Speaker 3>so they see someone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's the whole cult of</v>

1073
00:50:21.881 --> 00:50:22.691
<v Speaker 3>personality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1074
00:50:22.691 --> 00:50:24.400
<v Speaker 3>They see you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they see you,</v>

1075
00:50:24.410 --> 00:50:28.220
<v Speaker 3>you've got this powerful personality and</v>
<v Speaker 3>your positive and you're doing</v>

1076
00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:31.700
<v Speaker 2>things and people gravitate to that and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to be a part of that.</v>

1077
00:50:31.730 --> 00:50:33.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what happens with people,</v>

1078
00:50:33.650 --> 00:50:36.830
<v Speaker 2>but the first thing that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I said it because vice did a whole</v>

1079
00:50:36.831 --> 00:50:38.480
<v Speaker 2>18 minutes special on me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>

1080
00:50:38.481 --> 00:50:43.481
<v Speaker 2>if you just google a fucking a Vegan</v>
<v Speaker 2>iron man,</v>

1081
00:50:44.501 --> 00:50:47.000
<v Speaker 2>this shit comes up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did an 18 minute documentary and</v>

1082
00:50:47.001 --> 00:50:48.460
<v Speaker 2>one of the things I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first off,</v>

1083
00:50:49.070 --> 00:50:53.300
<v Speaker 2>don't say you can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could do any fucking thing.</v>

1084
00:50:53.301 --> 00:50:56.300
<v Speaker 2>You apply yourself too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just haven't tried.</v>

1085
00:50:56.301 --> 00:50:59.820
<v Speaker 2>You could do what I'm doing and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to tell you I go to racist,</v>

1086
00:50:59.821 --> 00:51:03.320
<v Speaker 2>these iron mans all over the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>world and these guys show me pitches.</v>

1087
00:51:03.321 --> 00:51:06.860
<v Speaker 2>One guy was fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He lost 100 fucking pounds.</v>

1088
00:51:06.861 --> 00:51:09.800
<v Speaker 2>Dude was so depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was on meds for depression,</v>

1089
00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:13.040
<v Speaker 2>so everything that I'm doing is coming</v>
<v Speaker 2>at a service.</v>

1090
00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:15.430
<v Speaker 2>It's service to help people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>

1091
00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:19.280
<v Speaker 2>I come at them right from the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking platform I'm like,</v>

1092
00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:21.150
<v Speaker 2>and even the Vedas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does it say?</v>

1093
00:51:21.260 --> 00:51:24.790
<v Speaker 2>Not a piece.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Han and throw money down an idea Yaka.</v>

1094
00:51:24.850 --> 00:51:25.880
<v Speaker 2>Danielle said that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hurry.</v>

1095
00:51:26.090 --> 00:51:28.430
<v Speaker 2>You should think of yourself lower than</v>
<v Speaker 2>destroying the street,</v>

1096
00:51:28.431 --> 00:51:33.050
<v Speaker 2>more tolerant than a tree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Always ready to offer respect to others.</v>

1097
00:51:33.350 --> 00:51:36.920
<v Speaker 2>In that state of mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one can constantly chant the holy names</v>

1098
00:51:36.921 --> 00:51:39.470
<v Speaker 2>of Hari Krishna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the philosophy.</v>

1099
00:51:39.590 --> 00:51:41.570
<v Speaker 2>So where is the false ego?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And thinking,</v>

1100
00:51:41.571 --> 00:51:44.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm better than you because I eat a</v>
<v Speaker 2>motherfucking vegetable and you eat a</v>

1101
00:51:44.751 --> 00:51:48.170
<v Speaker 2>fucking piece of meat or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not about that.</v>

1102
00:51:48.410 --> 00:51:52.850
<v Speaker 2>It's about trying to help people and</v>
<v Speaker 2>have compassion to people and that's</v>

1103
00:51:52.851 --> 00:51:56.690
<v Speaker 2>something that's really getting lost in</v>
<v Speaker 2>this world is compassion.</v>

1104
00:51:56.930 --> 00:52:01.760
<v Speaker 2>Everybody wants to kick people when</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're down and I just don't understand</v>

1105
00:52:01.761 --> 00:52:04.560
<v Speaker 2>where this fucking sickness came from</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1106
00:52:04.610 --> 00:52:09.530
<v Speaker 2>And I think a lot of it has to do with</v>
<v Speaker 2>reality TV and this whole microwave,</v>

1107
00:52:09.590 --> 00:52:12.380
<v Speaker 2>insta fame fucking culture that exists</v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

1108
00:52:12.530 --> 00:52:14.510
<v Speaker 2>It's like what you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they think that if,</v>

1109
00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:16.880
<v Speaker 2>if they put down somebody that's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make,</v>

1110
00:52:16.910 --> 00:52:19.170
<v Speaker 2>they're going to gain power from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1111
00:52:19.310 --> 00:52:21.740
<v Speaker 2>it's just crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't come from that.</v>

1112
00:52:21.741 --> 00:52:23.360
<v Speaker 2>I come from like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yo,</v>

1113
00:52:23.361 --> 00:52:26.180
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's help one another to make this</v>

1114
00:52:26.181 --> 00:52:28.940
<v Speaker 2>world a better place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How are we going to save the oceans?</v>

1115
00:52:28.941 --> 00:52:30.800
<v Speaker 2>How are we going to save?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1116
00:52:30.830 --> 00:52:33.110
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my thing is this,</v>

1117
00:52:33.111 --> 00:52:34.840
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just said that the,</v>

1118
00:52:34.850 --> 00:52:39.850
<v Speaker 2>the fucking commercial meat and dairy</v>
<v Speaker 2>industries are now the most toxic.</v>

1119
00:52:40.860 --> 00:52:44.990
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're the most toxic of companies on</v>

1120
00:52:44.991 --> 00:52:47.750
<v Speaker 2>the fucking planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just surpassed fossil fuel with the</v>

1121
00:52:47.751 --> 00:52:50.630
<v Speaker 2>destruction they're doing to the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm like,</v>

1122
00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:53.890
<v Speaker 2>eat a little less news is coming from it</v>
<v Speaker 2>just I just,</v>

1123
00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:54.560
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1124
00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:55.820
<v Speaker 2>it was just all on.</v>

1125
00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:57.860
<v Speaker 2>Where did I read it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was on,</v>

1126
00:52:57.890 --> 00:53:01.310
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the main sites like that.</v>

1127
00:53:01.390 --> 00:53:06.390
<v Speaker 2>So is this by a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from methane gas as a from fossil fuels</v>

1128
00:53:06.780 --> 00:53:07.610
<v Speaker 2>runoff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

1129
00:53:07.610 --> 00:53:08.660
<v Speaker 2>here's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing.</v>

1130
00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:12.200
<v Speaker 2>So before that Gulf oil spill ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened,</v>

1131
00:53:12.201 --> 00:53:15.170
<v Speaker 2>there was a fucking dead zone in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gulf of Mexico,</v>

1132
00:53:15.171 --> 00:53:19.270
<v Speaker 2>the size of New Jersey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why all the fucking run off of the</v>

1133
00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:23.360
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] and the farms with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking toxic pesticides,</v>

1134
00:53:23.690 --> 00:53:25.620
<v Speaker 2>the fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this shit that these guys are</v>

1135
00:53:25.621 --> 00:53:28.690
<v Speaker 2>spraying roundup and everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1136
00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:32.580
<v Speaker 2>and the nitrogen that's in the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit when these lagoons that have</v>

1137
00:53:32.581 --> 00:53:36.480
<v Speaker 2>100,000 fucking gallons of pig shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1138
00:53:36.481 --> 00:53:40.470
<v Speaker 2>it all was draining into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the Mississippi and then draining</v>

1139
00:53:40.471 --> 00:53:43.860
<v Speaker 2>into the Gulf.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you look at what's going on in</v>

1140
00:53:43.861 --> 00:53:45.690
<v Speaker 2>North Carolina right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I was just there,</v>

1141
00:53:45.930 --> 00:53:48.450
<v Speaker 2>motherfuckers can't even swim in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>rivers anymore.</v>

1142
00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:52.860
<v Speaker 2>And it's happening in Europe too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just had to cancel the swim on the</v>

1143
00:53:52.861 --> 00:53:56.670
<v Speaker 2>Iron Ironman in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Homburg because of the green allergy</v>

1144
00:53:56.671 --> 00:54:00.450
<v Speaker 2>and all this shit that's happening now</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of all the runoff that's</v>

1145
00:54:00.451 --> 00:54:03.430
<v Speaker 2>happening with the farms and everything</v>
<v Speaker 2>is just we're.</v>

1146
00:54:03.470 --> 00:54:06.930
<v Speaker 2>We're making this planet of fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>toxic wasteland</v>

1147
00:54:07.310 --> 00:54:11.730
<v Speaker 3>we've done with farms and it's gotten.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We developed cities.</v>

1148
00:54:11.731 --> 00:54:16.731
<v Speaker 3>We have giant groups of people that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>growing anything and then we give people</v>

1149
00:54:16.801 --> 00:54:20.910
<v Speaker 3>incentive to make as much profit as</v>
<v Speaker 3>possible and when they're trying to make</v>

1150
00:54:20.911 --> 00:54:24.390
<v Speaker 3>as much profit as possible without</v>
<v Speaker 3>ethics or morals and consideration are</v>

1151
00:54:24.510 --> 00:54:28.410
<v Speaker 3>or the impact on the environment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They set off a process in motion that we</v>

1152
00:54:28.411 --> 00:54:30.570
<v Speaker 3>are many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many decades into right now.</v>

1153
00:54:30.810 --> 00:54:34.110
<v Speaker 3>So to try to correct it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now we're just seeing the effects and</v>

1154
00:54:34.111 --> 00:54:37.440
<v Speaker 3>then on top of that there's all these ag</v>
<v Speaker 3>gag laws and that gag laws are</v>

1155
00:54:37.441 --> 00:54:41.310
<v Speaker 3>devastating because when you see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like one of the reasons I became a</v>

1156
00:54:41.311 --> 00:54:46.311
<v Speaker 3>hunter is because I was watching these</v>
<v Speaker 3>films of factory farming and I was like,</v>

1157
00:54:46.651 --> 00:54:48.810
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not participating in this.</v>

1158
00:54:48.811 --> 00:54:49.920
<v Speaker 3>I have to figure out what I'm going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

1159
00:54:49.921 --> 00:54:52.740
<v Speaker 3>I'm either going to become a vegetarian</v>
<v Speaker 3>or I'm going to become a hunter.</v>

1160
00:54:52.980 --> 00:54:55.440
<v Speaker 3>I decided to become a hunter and that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>how I get my meat,</v>

1161
00:54:55.890 --> 00:55:00.570
<v Speaker 3>but when you see those videos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are the videos that expose people</v>

1162
00:55:00.571 --> 00:55:04.260
<v Speaker 3>to the realities and the horrors of</v>
<v Speaker 3>factory farming and those are illegal in</v>

1163
00:55:04.261 --> 00:55:04.810
<v Speaker 3>most places.</v>

1164
00:55:04.810 --> 00:55:07.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go to prison now you go to federal</v>

1165
00:55:07.190 --> 00:55:11.480
<v Speaker 3>for showing horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>immoral acts that are done to these</v>

1166
00:55:11.481 --> 00:55:14.390
<v Speaker 3>animals and the way they're treated and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way they're contained,</v>

1167
00:55:14.391 --> 00:55:18.710
<v Speaker 3>and we were talking yesterday about this</v>
<v Speaker 3>video of a pig farm that there's this,</v>

1168
00:55:18.770 --> 00:55:22.310
<v Speaker 3>there's this pig farm where these pigs</v>
<v Speaker 3>are smashed into this place where they</v>

1169
00:55:22.311 --> 00:55:24.670
<v Speaker 3>can't move at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're all in these cases and then</v>

1170
00:55:24.690 --> 00:55:27.290
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a runoff from where they shit</v>

1171
00:55:27.291 --> 00:55:32.291
<v Speaker 3>and piss and there's a giant lake</v>
<v Speaker 3>outside of pig shit and pig pis and no</v>

1172
00:55:32.301 --> 00:55:34.700
<v Speaker 3>one who lives anywhere near that could</v>
<v Speaker 3>avoid that smell.</v>

1173
00:55:34.850 --> 00:55:38.150
<v Speaker 3>You drive anywhere near that area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a horrific toxic smell,</v>

1174
00:55:38.300 --> 00:55:43.130
<v Speaker 3>so it's already gotten to this almost</v>
<v Speaker 3>like incorrect double position like</v>

1175
00:55:43.131 --> 00:55:46.520
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that business is a toxic business,</v>

1176
00:55:46.970 --> 00:55:49.760
<v Speaker 3>but it's not a regular like a Joel</v>
<v Speaker 3>Salitan farm.</v>

1177
00:55:49.820 --> 00:55:51.260
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That guy has never heard of him.</v>

1178
00:55:51.620 --> 00:55:56.620
<v Speaker 3>He runs this farm called polyface farms</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what he does is he has all these</v>

1179
00:55:56.751 --> 00:55:59.300
<v Speaker 3>animals live like normal animals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the pigs,</v>

1180
00:55:59.510 --> 00:56:01.220
<v Speaker 3>they're not in these cages.</v>

1181
00:56:01.310 --> 00:56:05.870
<v Speaker 3>He has them roam free and they set.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They set up these enormous portable</v>

1182
00:56:05.871 --> 00:56:07.940
<v Speaker 3>fences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they take the pigs,</v>

1183
00:56:07.941 --> 00:56:10.400
<v Speaker 3>they roam in this one area like pigs</v>
<v Speaker 3>naturally do,</v>

1184
00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:13.520
<v Speaker 3>and then they moved the fence to a</v>
<v Speaker 3>different area and they transport.</v>

1185
00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:17.150
<v Speaker 3>They did move the pigs over with it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the pigs are never contained.</v>

1186
00:56:17.270 --> 00:56:21.350
<v Speaker 3>The chickens run free and then they go</v>
<v Speaker 3>back into the chicken house at night and</v>

1187
00:56:21.351 --> 00:56:24.250
<v Speaker 3>then they try not to have mono.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when you have,</v>

1188
00:56:24.580 --> 00:56:27.040
<v Speaker 3>when you have a thousand acres of</v>
<v Speaker 3>soybeans,</v>

1189
00:56:27.041 --> 00:56:29.350
<v Speaker 3>that shit ain't normal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not how plants are supposed to</v>

1190
00:56:29.351 --> 00:56:31.780
<v Speaker 3>be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you have to throw pesticides on</v>

1191
00:56:31.781 --> 00:56:34.840
<v Speaker 3>them and then when you roll them up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to grind everything up.</v>

1192
00:56:34.841 --> 00:56:37.990
<v Speaker 3>But these gigantic machines and</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything gets caught up in their mice</v>

1193
00:56:37.991 --> 00:56:39.780
<v Speaker 3>and rabbits and everything that might be</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>

1194
00:56:39.781 --> 00:56:42.160
<v Speaker 3>in the neighborhood while these machines</v>
<v Speaker 3>are rolling over.</v>

1195
00:56:42.430 --> 00:56:46.450
<v Speaker 3>All of that is unnatural and it's not</v>
<v Speaker 3>how human beings are supposed to grow</v>

1196
00:56:46.451 --> 00:56:48.640
<v Speaker 3>food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not food is supposed to be.</v>

1197
00:56:48.730 --> 00:56:51.580
<v Speaker 3>Some of these plants or animals are</v>
<v Speaker 3>supposed to be interacting with the</v>

1198
00:56:51.581 --> 00:56:53.770
<v Speaker 3>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what we're doing with these things</v>

1199
00:56:53.771 --> 00:56:56.440
<v Speaker 3>is making an incredible amounts of</v>
<v Speaker 3>profit.</v>

1200
00:56:56.560 --> 00:56:58.270
<v Speaker 3>And these people are addicted to this</v>
<v Speaker 3>profit.</v>

1201
00:56:58.390 --> 00:57:00.310
<v Speaker 3>These corporations are addicted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These profit,</v>

1202
00:57:00.490 --> 00:57:04.480
<v Speaker 3>they have this constant growth mentality</v>
<v Speaker 3>where every year,</v>

1203
00:57:04.481 --> 00:57:07.450
<v Speaker 3>every quarter has to have more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a never ending.</v>

1204
00:57:07.980 --> 00:57:09.850
<v Speaker 3>And they make the laws.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the only way,</v>

1205
00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:10.760
<v Speaker 3>the other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1206
00:57:10.761 --> 00:57:15.670
<v Speaker 3>they have massive amounts of money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they bribe politicians and they use</v>

1207
00:57:15.671 --> 00:57:16.820
<v Speaker 3>all of these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1208
00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:20.320
<v Speaker 3>these lobbyists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what they do is they get these laws</v>

1209
00:57:20.321 --> 00:57:24.100
<v Speaker 3>passed where it's illegal to film them</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing immoral shit.</v>

1210
00:57:24.460 --> 00:57:27.940
<v Speaker 3>And so then you don't see this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just go to the store and you buy a</v>

1211
00:57:27.941 --> 00:57:30.130
<v Speaker 3>cheeseburger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go to Jack in the box,</v>

1212
00:57:30.131 --> 00:57:32.440
<v Speaker 3>you go wherever you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you buy these things,</v>

1213
00:57:32.441 --> 00:57:35.800
<v Speaker 3>you get corn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know where you get corn Syrup in</v>

1214
00:57:35.801 --> 00:57:38.190
<v Speaker 3>your soda,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't think twice about what,</v>

1215
00:57:38.260 --> 00:57:42.310
<v Speaker 3>what has to happen for that corn to</v>
<v Speaker 3>become syrup and how much environmental</v>

1216
00:57:42.311 --> 00:57:43.720
<v Speaker 3>damage has to take place.</v>

1217
00:57:44.380 --> 00:57:49.380
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is the world we're living in</v>
<v Speaker 3>right now is just waking up to what has</v>

1218
00:57:49.421 --> 00:57:52.060
<v Speaker 3>been in motion for many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many decades.</v>

1219
00:57:52.510 --> 00:57:56.800
<v Speaker 3>I think what's really important though</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that we're honest about health and</v>

1220
00:57:56.801 --> 00:58:01.000
<v Speaker 3>they were honest about the consequences</v>
<v Speaker 3>of our actions in terms of like our</v>

1221
00:58:01.001 --> 00:58:03.700
<v Speaker 3>purchasing power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we're doing with food.</v>

1222
00:58:03.910 --> 00:58:06.880
<v Speaker 3>We got to be honest about all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the problems that happens</v>

1223
00:58:06.881 --> 00:58:11.080
<v Speaker 3>with hunters are carnivores or even</v>
<v Speaker 3>vegans or vegetarians,</v>

1224
00:58:11.081 --> 00:58:15.130
<v Speaker 3>is people only want to look at things</v>
<v Speaker 3>that support their position.</v>

1225
00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:17.980
<v Speaker 3>And with Vegans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of people out there that</v>

1226
00:58:18.070 --> 00:58:22.510
<v Speaker 3>only want to look at things that support</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vegan positions in terms of health.</v>

1227
00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:25.210
<v Speaker 3>And this becomes a real problem because</v>
<v Speaker 3>they start,</v>

1228
00:58:25.750 --> 00:58:28.330
<v Speaker 3>they start using studies that are very</v>
<v Speaker 3>shaky,</v>

1229
00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:31.990
<v Speaker 3>they start adding things to</v>
<v Speaker 3>documentaries that aren't necessarily</v>

1230
00:58:31.991 --> 00:58:36.370
<v Speaker 3>true or proven and it becomes propaganda</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it becomes propaganda both ways.</v>

1231
00:58:36.370 --> 00:58:39.460
<v Speaker 3>I see what this carnivore diet now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of people that would this</v>

1232
00:58:39.461 --> 00:58:41.950
<v Speaker 3>carnivore diet that are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the only way to go,</v>

1233
00:58:42.100 --> 00:58:43.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just eat all meat.</v>

1234
00:58:43.361 --> 00:58:44.194
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1235
00:58:44.530 --> 00:58:47.020
<v Speaker 3>I don't know about all that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't see any blood work.</v>

1236
00:58:47.021 --> 00:58:49.390
<v Speaker 3>I see blood work only I talked to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1243
00:59:03.311 --> 00:59:04.930
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>

1247
00:59:10.151 --> 00:59:12.340
<v Speaker 3>There's also all sorts of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I just want to say,</v>

1248
00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:14.050
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who were the Haas?</v>

1249
00:59:14.290 --> 00:59:18.610
<v Speaker 3>Let's just look at it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who are the hospitals filled with that</v>

1250
00:59:18.611 --> 00:59:22.610
<v Speaker 3>are having procedures for bypass?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who were the procedures</v>

1251
00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:27.140
<v Speaker 2>being done for people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Removing your limbs for diabetes is not</v>

1252
00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:32.200
<v Speaker 2>the people that it's the people that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>eating this toxic diet that Americans to</v>

1253
00:59:33.250 --> 00:59:37.370
<v Speaker 2>the standard American diet and what</v>
<v Speaker 2>people have become accustomed to eating,</v>

1254
00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:40.220
<v Speaker 2>rolling up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and even these carnival people.</v>

1255
00:59:40.300 --> 00:59:45.300
<v Speaker 2>Let's just take that for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you do all meet sure your body let</v>

1256
00:59:47.870 --> 00:59:49.850
<v Speaker 2>that motherfucker might've been on a</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dorito Diet.</v>

1257
00:59:49.851 --> 00:59:52.670
<v Speaker 2>We don't know what the fuck he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>eating prior prior to that.</v>

1258
00:59:52.910 --> 00:59:57.650
<v Speaker 2>So then you put the bodies a perfect</v>
<v Speaker 2>machine so it at the beginning of when</v>

1259
00:59:57.651 --> 01:00:00.650
<v Speaker 2>you're doing all meet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the body's become accustomed to that,</v>

1260
01:00:00.890 --> 01:00:05.630
<v Speaker 2>but you know the analogy that I use is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like getting off heroin and</v>

1261
01:00:05.631 --> 01:00:07.940
<v Speaker 2>getting on Methadone because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>methadone,</v>

1262
01:00:07.941 --> 01:00:10.280
<v Speaker 2>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kicked dope when I'm on fucking meth</v>

1263
01:00:10.281 --> 01:00:15.281
<v Speaker 2>now because the method on down the road</v>
<v Speaker 2>is going to take even a longer tool and</v>

1264
01:00:16.161 --> 01:00:19.190
<v Speaker 2>I've seen people that are doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>methadone for 20,</v>

1265
01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:23.540
<v Speaker 2>30 years and that's why I love the</v>
<v Speaker 2>analogy because the long term studies of</v>

1266
01:00:23.541 --> 01:00:27.410
<v Speaker 2>those diets do not exist right now.</v>

1267
01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:28.880
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no longterm studies for the</v>

1268
01:00:28.881 --> 01:00:31.970
<v Speaker 2>current,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you look at the blue zones around</v>

1269
01:00:31.971 --> 01:00:35.400
<v Speaker 2>the planet of the people who were the</v>
<v Speaker 2>most centurions and the people that live</v>

1270
01:00:35.401 --> 01:00:37.940
<v Speaker 2>the longest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have three things in common.</v>

1271
01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:39.560
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's,</v>

1272
01:00:39.650 --> 01:00:42.650
<v Speaker 2>there's blue zones in Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Costa Rica,</v>

1273
01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:46.340
<v Speaker 2>grease around the United States while</v>
<v Speaker 2>the top five,</v>

1274
01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:48.320
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the most and then,</v>

1275
01:00:48.350 --> 01:00:51.260
<v Speaker 2>and then California.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's the adventist seventh day</v>

1276
01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:54.320
<v Speaker 2>adventists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the three things that they have most</v>

1277
01:00:54.321 --> 01:00:56.330
<v Speaker 2>in common with the people that live the</v>
<v Speaker 2>longest.</v>

1278
01:00:56.780 --> 01:00:58.820
<v Speaker 2>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have a meditation,</v>

1279
01:00:58.821 --> 01:01:03.020
<v Speaker 2>spiritual practice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do something every day for pma,</v>

1280
01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:06.380
<v Speaker 2>positive mental attitude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever their higher power is,</v>

1281
01:01:06.381 --> 01:01:08.930
<v Speaker 2>they do that every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Number two,</v>

1282
01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:11.270
<v Speaker 2>they moved their bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're working,</v>

1283
01:01:11.570 --> 01:01:13.670
<v Speaker 2>they work in the farm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're exercising.</v>

1284
01:01:14.090 --> 01:01:17.690
<v Speaker 2>Number three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they eat primarily a plant based diet.</v>

1285
01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:22.100
<v Speaker 2>They may have a piece of fish in Japan</v>
<v Speaker 2>or whatever,</v>

1286
01:01:22.310 --> 01:01:27.310
<v Speaker 2>or a piece of meat once in awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but primarily the seven day adventist</v>

1287
01:01:27.381 --> 01:01:32.180
<v Speaker 2>study was actually the best one because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was all from different people with</v>

1288
01:01:32.181 --> 01:01:33.560
<v Speaker 2>different ethnic backgrounds.</v>

1289
01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:35.380
<v Speaker 2>And the one thing that they had in</v>
<v Speaker 2>common,</v>

1290
01:01:35.430 --> 01:01:39.230
<v Speaker 2>the seven day adventists don't eat meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1291
01:01:39.260 --> 01:01:43.110
<v Speaker 2>that's my point with the whole thing and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1292
01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:46.060
<v Speaker 2>when it comes down to diet is I just see</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1293
01:01:46.190 --> 01:01:51.190
<v Speaker 2>what worked for me and I try to relay</v>
<v Speaker 2>that to people and not not be like my</v>

1294
01:01:51.951 --> 01:01:54.680
<v Speaker 2>way's the only way and this and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>because people,</v>

1295
01:01:54.830 --> 01:01:57.710
<v Speaker 2>people doing other people are doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>other things,</v>

1296
01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in their way.</v>

1297
01:01:59.571 --> 01:02:01.850
<v Speaker 2>There's raw foodist is all these</v>
<v Speaker 2>different people.</v>

1298
01:02:01.851 --> 01:02:04.790
<v Speaker 2>And the problem is with the false ego in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a human being,</v>

1299
01:02:04.850 --> 01:02:08.030
<v Speaker 2>everybody wants to think that the class</v>
<v Speaker 2>is full.</v>

1300
01:02:08.060 --> 01:02:10.070
<v Speaker 2>Don't try to tell me Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it all.</v>

1301
01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:14.090
<v Speaker 2>Here's an issue with centurions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the centurions century.</v>

1302
01:02:14.190 --> 01:02:16.460
<v Speaker 2>Aaron's centenarians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>centenarians,</v>

1303
01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:17.533
<v Speaker 2>centenarians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1304
01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:19.800
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that lived to be 100 years</v>

1305
01:02:20.530 --> 01:02:22.410
<v Speaker 3>is one thing we have to take into</v>
<v Speaker 3>consideration.</v>

1306
01:02:22.411 --> 01:02:25.920
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about people that lived</v>
<v Speaker 3>already to be 100 years.</v>

1307
01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:28.440
<v Speaker 3>So when they were 50 was 50 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

1308
01:02:28.470 --> 01:02:32.400
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about 1967.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody knew shit about diet back then.</v>

1309
01:02:32.490 --> 01:02:33.650
<v Speaker 3>This is the fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1310
01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:37.810
<v Speaker 3>so the people that did live that long</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they were living this,</v>

1311
01:02:37.830 --> 01:02:40.800
<v Speaker 3>it's almost a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an accident in some ways are</v>

1312
01:02:40.801 --> 01:02:42.600
<v Speaker 3>inconsequential.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>

1313
01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:46.780
<v Speaker 3>What is going on today with people's</v>
<v Speaker 3>Diet and how long will people live too.</v>

1314
01:02:46.790 --> 01:02:51.510
<v Speaker 3>There's far more information in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 3>nutrition and what you should do and</v>

1315
01:02:51.511 --> 01:02:54.990
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't do for your body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what I'm concerned with is like what</v>

1316
01:02:54.991 --> 01:02:57.930
<v Speaker 3>optimizes people today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to see blood work.</v>

1317
01:02:58.140 --> 01:03:00.810
<v Speaker 3>I want to see like what is going on with</v>
<v Speaker 3>your blood lipids,</v>

1318
01:03:01.110 --> 01:03:02.850
<v Speaker 3>what is going on with your nutrient</v>
<v Speaker 3>levels,</v>

1319
01:03:02.851 --> 01:03:06.750
<v Speaker 3>what is going on with that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in that case we don't have.</v>

1320
01:03:06.810 --> 01:03:10.800
<v Speaker 3>We have just a few studies from a few</v>
<v Speaker 3>people or if you test from a few people</v>

1321
01:03:10.801 --> 01:03:13.500
<v Speaker 3>that have done this carnivore diet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have some people that have done the</v>

1322
01:03:13.501 --> 01:03:15.840
<v Speaker 3>Vegan diet and have had real hard</v>
<v Speaker 3>problems with that.</v>

1323
01:03:15.890 --> 01:03:16.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's just.</v>

1324
01:03:16.790 --> 01:03:19.850
<v Speaker 2>Let me just say one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because to throw the word Vegan on</v>

1325
01:03:19.851 --> 01:03:22.220
<v Speaker 2>something that does not make it a</v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy diet.</v>

1326
01:03:22.221 --> 01:03:24.770
<v Speaker 2>I know Reagan's data fucking 100 pounds</v>
<v Speaker 2>overweight.</v>

1327
01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:27.140
<v Speaker 2>They eat nothing but fried chicken</v>
<v Speaker 2>pizza.</v>

1328
01:03:27.380 --> 01:03:30.980
<v Speaker 2>You say in organic whole food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>plant based Diet.</v>

1329
01:03:31.010 --> 01:03:32.250
<v Speaker 2>That's what I roll with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1330
01:03:32.251 --> 01:03:35.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't fucking say I took a Vegan diet</v>

1331
01:03:35.091 --> 01:03:38.420
<v Speaker 2>can mean anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you say whole food foods in</v>

1332
01:03:38.421 --> 01:03:40.160
<v Speaker 2>their original source,</v>
<v Speaker 2>organic,</v>

1333
01:03:40.161 --> 01:03:41.930
<v Speaker 2>no pesticides,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole food,</v>

1334
01:03:42.110 --> 01:03:44.030
<v Speaker 2>plant based Diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I roll with,</v>

1335
01:03:44.250 --> 01:03:47.930
<v Speaker 2>so that's why I don't go around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nutrient dense mineral dense and the</v>

1336
01:03:47.931 --> 01:03:49.400
<v Speaker 2>minerals mineral dense</v>

1337
01:03:49.470 --> 01:03:52.920
<v Speaker 3>with people that live a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that you get from a</v>

1338
01:03:52.921 --> 01:03:56.280
<v Speaker 3>lot of plants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially like rich green leafy plants,</v>

1339
01:03:56.530 --> 01:03:58.200
<v Speaker 3>you get a lot of minerals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely,</v>

1340
01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:02.610
<v Speaker 3>and more importantly if these things are</v>
<v Speaker 3>raised in an organic environment,</v>

1341
01:04:02.611 --> 01:04:06.200
<v Speaker 3>you're getting soil that's not depleted</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is a big problem with model.</v>

1342
01:04:06.740 --> 01:04:11.740
<v Speaker 2>Did you see the article that just came</v>
<v Speaker 2>out today that 40 years ago and orange</v>

1343
01:04:12.081 --> 01:04:15.350
<v Speaker 2>was 10 times more and more nutritious?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was.</v>

1344
01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:18.920
<v Speaker 2>I think it might've been CNN online or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

1345
01:04:18.921 --> 01:04:23.921
<v Speaker 2>They posted an article that said the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fruits and vegetables from 40 years ago</v>

1346
01:04:23.931 --> 01:04:28.931
<v Speaker 2>were 10 times more nutritious than the</v>
<v Speaker 2>than the way they're being grown today</v>

1347
01:04:29.031 --> 01:04:33.110
<v Speaker 2>because like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rows and rows and rows.</v>

1348
01:04:33.140 --> 01:04:36.080
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do they extract the nutrients</v>

1349
01:04:36.081 --> 01:04:39.410
<v Speaker 2>properly from the soil?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's impossible.</v>

1350
01:04:39.810 --> 01:04:40.261
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1351
01:04:40.261 --> 01:04:42.690
<v Speaker 3>they have to actually add nutrients to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the soil.</v>

1352
01:04:42.691 --> 01:04:45.810
<v Speaker 3>Most of the time it just adding nitrogen</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a few other different minerals,</v>

1353
01:04:45.811 --> 01:04:46.644
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

1354
01:04:47.950 --> 01:04:49.050
<v Speaker 2>pig shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>

1355
01:04:49.420 --> 01:04:53.260
<v Speaker 2>What they do is to get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did they get rid of that pig shit.</v>

1356
01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:57.670
<v Speaker 2>They're spraying it on the fucking crops</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1357
01:04:57.850 --> 01:05:00.650
<v Speaker 2>well you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're supposed to rotate crops in</v>

1358
01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:04.600
<v Speaker 2>rotation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you plant next to each other that</v>

1359
01:05:04.601 --> 01:05:07.180
<v Speaker 2>are extra.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a farmer composting,</v>

1360
01:05:07.181 --> 01:05:11.500
<v Speaker 2>but I have a friend that is an organic</v>
<v Speaker 2>farmer and his name,</v>

1361
01:05:11.530 --> 01:05:16.530
<v Speaker 2>his name is Keith and he farms up in New</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hampshire and he knows all about crop</v>

1362
01:05:18.341 --> 01:05:22.450
<v Speaker 2>rotation as Keith Leon Forte.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have to do,</v>

1363
01:05:22.451 --> 01:05:23.740
<v Speaker 2>you can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what he does.</v>

1364
01:05:23.741 --> 01:05:24.910
<v Speaker 2>He has a small farm.</v>

1365
01:05:24.930 --> 01:05:29.250
<v Speaker 3>The small farms are legit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you can have a small farm and be in</v>

1366
01:05:29.251 --> 01:05:32.790
<v Speaker 3>symbiosis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so like you could be in harmony with the</v>

1367
01:05:32.791 --> 01:05:34.170
<v Speaker 3>land,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but man,</v>

1368
01:05:34.380 --> 01:05:35.610
<v Speaker 3>you're starting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're growing,</v>

1369
01:05:35.660 --> 01:05:38.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking a thousand acres of corn for</v>

1370
01:05:38.371 --> 01:05:39.780
<v Speaker 3>cattle feed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

1371
01:05:39.870 --> 01:05:42.090
<v Speaker 3>you might as well be making oil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1372
01:05:42.210 --> 01:05:43.010
<v Speaker 3>I mean you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

1373
01:05:43.010 --> 01:05:44.670
<v Speaker 3>you're doing something that's kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy,</v>

1374
01:05:44.690 --> 01:05:46.290
<v Speaker 3>that environment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not natural.</v>

1375
01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:46.610
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1376
01:05:46.610 --> 01:05:47.590
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and listen,</v>

1377
01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:50.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw a Ted knew Jim play with fucking</v>

1378
01:05:50.590 --> 01:05:54.370
<v Speaker 2>ACDC and Black Sabbath and 76 at Madison</v>
<v Speaker 2>Square Garden.</v>

1379
01:05:54.371 --> 01:05:56.540
<v Speaker 2>I went to all them shows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1380
01:05:56.710 --> 01:05:59.080
<v Speaker 2>when he came on and the shit that he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking,</v>

1381
01:05:59.081 --> 01:06:03.340
<v Speaker 2>I was just like the fucking gmo crops.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1382
01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:07.900
<v Speaker 2>Eighty percent of the GMO crop is being</v>
<v Speaker 2>fed to animals for fucking slaughter to</v>

1383
01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:11.440
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what he called to stupid vegans are not</v>

1384
01:06:11.441 --> 01:06:15.700
<v Speaker 2>the ones that are eating that shit that</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of the crops that are genetically</v>

1385
01:06:15.701 --> 01:06:17.980
<v Speaker 2>modified,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you have these corporations,</v>

1386
01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:20.200
<v Speaker 2>Mcdonald's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every one of these corporations,</v>

1387
01:06:20.470 --> 01:06:23.680
<v Speaker 2>they want every fucking piece of meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It tastes the same.</v>

1388
01:06:24.010 --> 01:06:27.100
<v Speaker 2>They want every fucking French fries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>potato to be the same.</v>

1389
01:06:27.250 --> 01:06:32.250
<v Speaker 2>So the only way they can control it is</v>
<v Speaker 2>the control of the genetic markers.</v>

1390
01:06:32.620 --> 01:06:37.620
<v Speaker 2>So that's why they're using all of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the majority of the genetically</v>

1391
01:06:37.841 --> 01:06:40.120
<v Speaker 2>modified grains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Monsanto,</v>

1392
01:06:40.810 --> 01:06:41.970
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1393
01:06:42.070 --> 01:06:46.150
<v Speaker 2>who just got bought out by bear and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're changing the name because</v>

1394
01:06:46.151 --> 01:06:50.320
<v Speaker 2>Monsanto is such a big rap rap rap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't know it,</v>

1395
01:06:50.321 --> 01:06:52.060
<v Speaker 2>bear just bought them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1396
01:06:52.061 --> 01:06:54.670
<v Speaker 2>do you know the history of bear from</v>
<v Speaker 2>surgical company?</v>

1397
01:06:54.690 --> 01:06:56.720
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no.</v>

1398
01:06:56.980 --> 01:07:01.980
<v Speaker 2>Prior to that they made this cast that</v>
<v Speaker 2>went into the Nazi death chambers.</v>

1399
01:07:02.340 --> 01:07:03.540
<v Speaker 3>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what's funny,</v>

1400
01:07:03.830 --> 01:07:08.220
<v Speaker 3>that nightclub,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cyclops gas was created by Fritz Haber.</v>

1401
01:07:08.310 --> 01:07:11.970
<v Speaker 3>Fritz harbor is also the guy who created</v>
<v Speaker 3>the process of extracting nitrogen from</v>

1402
01:07:11.971 --> 01:07:12.960
<v Speaker 3>the air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

1403
01:07:12.990 --> 01:07:15.720
<v Speaker 3>So he's the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reason why we can grow the crops</v>

1404
01:07:15.721 --> 01:07:17.820
<v Speaker 3>that we have today is because of Fritz</v>
<v Speaker 3>harbor.</v>

1405
01:07:17.821 --> 01:07:21.600
<v Speaker 3>They say that 50 percent of the nitrogen</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the nitrogen and most people's DNA</v>

1406
01:07:21.601 --> 01:07:25.200
<v Speaker 3>comes from the harbor method.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He also created cycle on a,</v>

1407
01:07:25.850 --> 01:07:29.150
<v Speaker 3>on a client,</v>
<v Speaker 3>be the Nazis.</v>

1408
01:07:29.180 --> 01:07:31.440
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he created cycle on a and they added</v>

1409
01:07:31.441 --> 01:07:34.150
<v Speaker 3>this smell to it so that you could smell</v>
<v Speaker 3>this toxic gas.</v>

1410
01:07:34.210 --> 01:07:36.750
<v Speaker 3>You would know it when it was coming so</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can get out of the way.</v>

1411
01:07:37.080 --> 01:07:42.080
<v Speaker 3>The Nazis switched to design B.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fritz Harbor was actually a Jew and they</v>

1412
01:07:42.211 --> 01:07:47.130
<v Speaker 3>took his invention and cut out the smell</v>
<v Speaker 3>portion of it so that they could gas</v>

1413
01:07:47.131 --> 01:07:47.964
<v Speaker 3>Jews with</v>

1414
01:07:48.490 --> 01:07:49.990
<v Speaker 2>dark shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1415
01:07:49.991 --> 01:07:52.670
<v Speaker 2>Joseph Smart motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm learning today.</v>

1416
01:07:54.430 --> 01:07:56.790
<v Speaker 2>It's dark shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but bob or method</v>

1417
01:07:57.600 --> 01:07:59.610
<v Speaker 3>saved a lot of people and killed a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>of people.</v>

1418
01:07:59.970 --> 01:08:03.270
<v Speaker 3>They wanted to try that guy for crimes</v>
<v Speaker 3>against humanity while he was winning</v>

1419
01:08:03.271 --> 01:08:07.380
<v Speaker 3>the Nobel Prize for science at the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>time as he was also the first people.</v>

1420
01:08:07.381 --> 01:08:11.940
<v Speaker 3>He was one of the first people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>implemented a gassing program where they</v>

1421
01:08:11.941 --> 01:08:12.870
<v Speaker 3>used it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the gas,</v>

1422
01:08:12.871 --> 01:08:15.030
<v Speaker 3>the allied troops in World War One.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was.</v>

1423
01:08:15.530 --> 01:08:16.820
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a big part of that.</v>

1424
01:08:16.940 --> 01:08:18.380
<v Speaker 2>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did not know that.</v>

1425
01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:19.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy shit.</v>

1426
01:08:19.860 --> 01:08:24.330
<v Speaker 3>So that is how we get nitrogen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We get nitrogen from the harbor method</v>

1427
01:08:24.331 --> 01:08:26.040
<v Speaker 3>when they're poor nitrogen into the</v>
<v Speaker 3>plant,</v>

1428
01:08:26.130 --> 01:08:28.710
<v Speaker 3>into the soil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they can grow plants.</v>

1429
01:08:29.340 --> 01:08:31.740
<v Speaker 3>That's a big part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you say genetically modified to</v>

1430
01:08:31.741 --> 01:08:33.150
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a big part of that is like we want to</v>

1431
01:08:33.151 --> 01:08:36.000
<v Speaker 3>think about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh like labs and science and all this</v>

1432
01:08:36.001 --> 01:08:38.520
<v Speaker 3>jazz,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but almost everything we eat is</v>

1433
01:08:38.521 --> 01:08:40.890
<v Speaker 3>genetically modified including all of</v>
<v Speaker 3>our grains.</v>

1434
01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:43.140
<v Speaker 3>Like especially all of our fruits and</v>
<v Speaker 3>vegetables.</v>

1435
01:08:43.370 --> 01:08:48.240
<v Speaker 3>We were saying about tomatoes or</v>
<v Speaker 3>orange being different than it was 10</v>

1436
01:08:48.241 --> 01:08:50.730
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking everything's different because</v>

1437
01:08:50.731 --> 01:08:54.120
<v Speaker 3>they want these things to be durable so</v>
<v Speaker 3>they could throw them in a bus or a</v>

1438
01:08:54.121 --> 01:08:55.990
<v Speaker 3>truck rather than travel close to</v>
<v Speaker 3>French.</v>

1439
01:08:56.570 --> 01:08:58.760
<v Speaker 2>Well here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I know what they do.</v>

1440
01:08:58.761 --> 01:09:03.761
<v Speaker 2>They take the DNA of a flounder and</v>
<v Speaker 2>injected into tomatoes so it can resist</v>

1441
01:09:04.670 --> 01:09:05.960
<v Speaker 2>the fraud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How the fuck did they do?</v>

1442
01:09:05.970 --> 01:09:07.280
<v Speaker 2>I don't fucking know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

1443
01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:09.470
<v Speaker 2>That's real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you eat a tomato,</v>

1444
01:09:09.471 --> 01:09:11.750
<v Speaker 2>does it have flounder right now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vegans?</v>

1445
01:09:11.751 --> 01:09:14.570
<v Speaker 2>If you're eating GMO shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you're not eating Vegan food.</v>

1446
01:09:14.571 --> 01:09:16.910
<v Speaker 2>You could be eating a fish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tomato thing</v>

1447
01:09:17.230 --> 01:09:21.390
<v Speaker 3>is if you eat plants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>plants absorb like you.</v>

1448
01:09:21.420 --> 01:09:26.420
<v Speaker 3>They've found salmon DNA in some plants</v>
<v Speaker 3>because plants absorb this fish thing</v>

1449
01:09:27.970 --> 01:09:29.840
<v Speaker 3>that people use for fertilizer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1450
01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:32.890
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're getting some of that animal,</v>

1451
01:09:32.891 --> 01:09:35.710
<v Speaker 3>but it's a natural cycle that you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting it through.</v>

1452
01:09:36.190 --> 01:09:38.200
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>animals eat animals,</v>

1453
01:09:38.201 --> 01:09:39.760
<v Speaker 3>plants eat animals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>animals,</v>

1454
01:09:39.761 --> 01:09:42.040
<v Speaker 3>even eat plants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is fucking crazy plants in</v>

1455
01:09:42.041 --> 01:09:43.060
<v Speaker 3>South America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks like a,</v>

1456
01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:47.200
<v Speaker 3>like a vase and these rats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get attracted this sweet smell</v>

1457
01:09:47.201 --> 01:09:51.310
<v Speaker 3>around the edges and it's slick and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>fall into the hole and the plant closes</v>

1458
01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:54.070
<v Speaker 3>in and swallows them and eats them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1459
01:09:54.190 --> 01:09:55.023
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1460
01:09:55.190 --> 01:09:57.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other thing is this,</v>

1461
01:09:58.190 --> 01:10:00.920
<v Speaker 2>you have chemical companies making you</v>
<v Speaker 2>food.</v>

1462
01:10:01.010 --> 01:10:04.210
<v Speaker 2>Their job is not to feed the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not to keep you healthy.</v>

1463
01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:07.760
<v Speaker 2>Their job is to sell fucking pesticides.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's,</v>

1464
01:10:07.761 --> 01:10:10.970
<v Speaker 2>let's be fucking straight up about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

1465
01:10:10.971 --> 01:10:13.190
<v Speaker 2>they created.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the other,</v>

1466
01:10:13.340 --> 01:10:16.910
<v Speaker 2>across a genetic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>

1467
01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:18.300
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1468
01:10:18.300 --> 01:10:20.390
<v Speaker 2>a vegetable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was brought up.</v>

1469
01:10:20.420 --> 01:10:22.070
<v Speaker 2>Was it cauliflower?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Broccoli?</v>

1470
01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:25.190
<v Speaker 2>They mixed two things and came out with</v>
<v Speaker 2>a.</v>

1471
01:10:25.191 --> 01:10:28.730
<v Speaker 2>it's a different process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they're doing now and really what</v>

1472
01:10:28.731 --> 01:10:33.731
<v Speaker 2>they do when they can take roundup and</v>
<v Speaker 2>pesticides and put it in the fucking</v>

1473
01:10:34.010 --> 01:10:35.050
<v Speaker 2>seed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1474
01:10:35.210 --> 01:10:37.190
<v Speaker 2>is what they're doing now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

1475
01:10:37.220 --> 01:10:41.640
<v Speaker 3>so the plant from the growth cycle is</v>
<v Speaker 3>resistant to these brands</v>

1476
01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:44.210
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all the people that have in the gut</v>

1477
01:10:44.211 --> 01:10:45.620
<v Speaker 2>issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you listen,</v>

1478
01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:47.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you had rich roll on twice.</v>

1479
01:10:47.631 --> 01:10:50.310
<v Speaker 2>He's my boy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a homie dude.</v>

1480
01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:52.970
<v Speaker 2>He's fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone asked me like what's time</v>

1481
01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:55.370
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker life and what's he like in</v>
<v Speaker 2>real life.</v>

1482
01:10:55.371 --> 01:10:58.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the most genuine fucking dude,</v>

1483
01:10:58.460 --> 01:11:00.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you ever have anything going on?</v>

1484
01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:02.930
<v Speaker 2>He just wrote the forward to my new</v>
<v Speaker 2>book,</v>

1485
01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:04.550
<v Speaker 2>the PMA effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1486
01:11:04.551 --> 01:11:06.920
<v Speaker 2>he's such a fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a solid cat.</v>

1487
01:11:06.980 --> 01:11:08.800
<v Speaker 2>Very solid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

1488
01:11:08.930 --> 01:11:11.020
<v Speaker 2>where was I going with that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You took me down to plans.</v>

1489
01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:12.050
<v Speaker 2>Glyphosate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1490
01:11:12.051 --> 01:11:15.180
<v Speaker 2>So he just had Dr Zach Bush.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>

1491
01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:17.430
<v Speaker 2>Who's a doctor?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is clinical research.</v>

1492
01:11:17.431 --> 01:11:21.300
<v Speaker 2>This is not speculation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not fucking Vegan propaganda.</v>

1493
01:11:21.301 --> 01:11:24.600
<v Speaker 2>This is fucking science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he proved that glyphosate.</v>

1494
01:11:24.630 --> 01:11:26.760
<v Speaker 2>And what's happening now with the gut</v>
<v Speaker 2>health,</v>

1495
01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.940
<v Speaker 2>gut health is such a huge issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything,</v>

1496
01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:34.320
<v Speaker 2>the bad fucking disease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it starts in the gut and the glyphosate</v>

1497
01:11:34.350 --> 01:11:38.910
<v Speaker 2>is eating through the stomach wall and</v>
<v Speaker 2>causing leaky gut and all these other</v>

1498
01:11:40.860 --> 01:11:43.890
<v Speaker 2>physical diseases from happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1499
01:11:43.891 --> 01:11:47.190
<v Speaker 2>the other thing is you have to realize</v>
<v Speaker 2>what these pesticides are.</v>

1500
01:11:47.340 --> 01:11:51.330
<v Speaker 2>They're neurotoxins and then the ones</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're putting inside the seed.</v>

1501
01:11:51.331 --> 01:11:53.730
<v Speaker 2>When the bug eats the leaf,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it fucking dies.</v>

1502
01:11:53.970 --> 01:11:58.080
<v Speaker 2>So you're eating these fruits and</v>
<v Speaker 2>vegetables that are completely fucking</v>

1503
01:11:58.081 --> 01:11:58.770
<v Speaker 2>toxic.</v>

1504
01:11:58.770 --> 01:11:59.890
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what happens.</v>

1505
01:11:59.891 --> 01:12:01.510
<v Speaker 1>When they created it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things,</v>

1506
01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:03.370
<v Speaker 1>one of the reasons why they were able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>implement it,</v>

1507
01:12:03.371 --> 01:12:06.370
<v Speaker 1>they said it doesn't kill people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It kills plants and it kills bacteria.</v>

1508
01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:07.270
<v Speaker 1>So everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1509
01:12:07.271 --> 01:12:07.960
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1510
01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:10.630
<v Speaker 1>no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It only kills plants and bacteria that's</v>

1511
01:12:10.631 --> 01:12:14.030
<v Speaker 1>totally safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know your body is filled with bacteria</v>

1512
01:12:14.031 --> 01:12:17.080
<v Speaker 1>or your good bacteria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gut as more eco live than there's</v>

1513
01:12:17.081 --> 01:12:19.090
<v Speaker 1>ever been a human being on the planet</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>

1514
01:12:19.091 --> 01:12:24.091
<v Speaker 1>There's more cola in your staff and any</v>
<v Speaker 1>humans that have ever lived more numbers</v>

1515
01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:28.720
<v Speaker 1>and you need them and need to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bacterial flora gets destroyed by</v>

1516
01:12:28.721 --> 01:12:30.450
<v Speaker 1>glyphosate gets destroyed by.</v>

1517
01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:31.580
<v Speaker 2>That's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1518
01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:36.500
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that podcast that he did that</v>

1519
01:12:36.501 --> 01:12:40.910
<v Speaker 2>episode with Dr Zach Bush is fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking unbelievable and I'm</v>

1520
01:12:40.911 --> 01:12:42.290
<v Speaker 2>surprised like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1521
01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:45.910
<v Speaker 2>motherfuckers didn't try to take</v>
<v Speaker 2>tattooed out at this point.</v>

1522
01:12:46.020 --> 01:12:46.570
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1523
01:12:46.570 --> 01:12:49.110
<v Speaker 1>they're making so much money and people</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't listening and there's so much</v>

1524
01:12:49.111 --> 01:12:51.730
<v Speaker 1>signal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so many noises and they use the</v>

1525
01:12:51.731 --> 01:12:55.500
<v Speaker 1>word that everyone loves to use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The two words.</v>

1526
01:12:55.530 --> 01:12:57.430
<v Speaker 1>Conspiracy theories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1527
01:12:57.450 --> 01:12:59.040
<v Speaker 1>That's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But here's the thing.</v>

1528
01:12:59.370 --> 01:13:03.090
<v Speaker 1>Once you can prove something in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>data and evidence to back it up,</v>

1529
01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:06.330
<v Speaker 1>it's no longer a theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a fucking fact.</v>

1530
01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:08.850
<v Speaker 1>So there's been a conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just it.</v>

1531
01:13:09.390 --> 01:13:11.400
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they implemented it,</v>

1532
01:13:11.401 --> 01:13:13.890
<v Speaker 1>they probably did think that they could</v>
<v Speaker 1>get away with it.</v>

1533
01:13:14.070 --> 01:13:17.040
<v Speaker 1>They think it would have been fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They really probably didn't know as much</v>

1534
01:13:17.041 --> 01:13:20.340
<v Speaker 1>as we know today about gut biome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all new shit.</v>

1535
01:13:20.341 --> 01:13:25.070
<v Speaker 1>That's all within the last couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>decades was already tree.</v>

1536
01:13:26.130 --> 01:13:27.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kimchi is fucking amazing.</v>

1537
01:13:27.850 --> 01:13:30.150
<v Speaker 1>I drink a lot of water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1538
01:13:30.151 --> 01:13:32.340
<v Speaker 1>I drink a lot of Kombucha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eat a lot of Kimchi.</v>

1539
01:13:32.341 --> 01:13:34.140
<v Speaker 1>That's where I get it from primarily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1540
01:13:34.290 --> 01:13:35.250
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's good stuff.</v>

1541
01:13:35.580 --> 01:13:38.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean gut biome is gigantic,</v>

1542
01:13:38.161 --> 01:13:39.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the point where people make memes</v>

1543
01:13:39.931 --> 01:13:43.680
<v Speaker 1>joking around about me saying gut biome</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I say it so much</v>

1544
01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:45.020
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1545
01:13:45.021 --> 01:13:47.960
<v Speaker 2>the other reason that I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know where this whole</v>

1546
01:13:48.860 --> 01:13:52.330
<v Speaker 2>conversation would go because I have</v>
<v Speaker 2>respect for you as a martial artist.</v>

1547
01:13:52.340 --> 01:13:56.210
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know Brian since the eighties and you</v>

1548
01:13:56.211 --> 01:13:57.620
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he always talked about you,</v>

1549
01:13:57.621 --> 01:14:02.420
<v Speaker 2>but rich roll wrote you and said that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was up at his house and heard that I was</v>

1550
01:14:02.421 --> 01:14:06.110
<v Speaker 2>coming on the podcast and you responded</v>
<v Speaker 2>to him in a text message and said,</v>

1551
01:14:06.111 --> 01:14:07.730
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so fucking toxic.</v>

1552
01:14:07.731 --> 01:14:09.470
<v Speaker 2>What's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1553
01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:10.970
<v Speaker 2>I just want to sit down.</v>

1554
01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:13.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's another form of identity politics,</v>

1555
01:14:13.870 --> 01:14:14.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and people,</v>

1556
01:14:14.991 --> 01:14:16.460
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of people that I'm friends</v>

1557
01:14:16.461 --> 01:14:18.310
<v Speaker 3>with that have all sorts of dis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1558
01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:20.690
<v Speaker 3>they agree with things that I don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>agree with.</v>

1559
01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:22.610
<v Speaker 3>They have ideas that I don't agree with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1560
01:14:22.611 --> 01:14:25.640
<v Speaker 3>you're allowed to have varying opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what human beings,</v>

1561
01:14:25.641 --> 01:14:27.530
<v Speaker 3>we're all about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're supposed to be able to communicate</v>

1562
01:14:27.531 --> 01:14:29.360
<v Speaker 3>our ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're not my enemy.</v>

1563
01:14:29.390 --> 01:14:31.430
<v Speaker 3>If you eat plants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's crazy.</v>

1564
01:14:31.460 --> 01:14:33.320
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the problem is I eat plants too.</v>

1565
01:14:33.321 --> 01:14:36.220
<v Speaker 3>I eat a shitload of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this idea that you know,</v>

1566
01:14:36.290 --> 01:14:38.990
<v Speaker 3>that vegans and mediators are supposed</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be enemies.</v>

1567
01:14:39.150 --> 01:14:41.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a strange man.</v>

1568
01:14:41.281 --> 01:14:43.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to tell you straight up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hang out with dudes.</v>

1569
01:14:43.621 --> 01:14:46.890
<v Speaker 2>Dad fucking eat McDonald's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I have friends.</v>

1570
01:14:47.370 --> 01:14:51.480
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't look like I said I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fly looking for the shit,</v>

1571
01:14:51.690 --> 01:14:55.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try to look to the positivity of every</v>

1572
01:14:55.411 --> 01:14:58.780
<v Speaker 2>human being and some of them eat meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My brother fucking my,</v>

1573
01:14:58.830 --> 01:15:01.200
<v Speaker 2>my brother eats meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm supposed to hate my brother because</v>

1574
01:15:01.201 --> 01:15:03.360
<v Speaker 2>my brother eats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eats fucking meat,</v>

1575
01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:05.090
<v Speaker 2>you know it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1576
01:15:05.110 --> 01:15:08.220
<v Speaker 2>it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like you said,</v>

1577
01:15:08.221 --> 01:15:13.221
<v Speaker 2>it's identity politics and I don't roll</v>
<v Speaker 2>with that because if in my line of work</v>

1578

<v Speaker 2>which is getting people out of some</v>

<v Speaker 2>five points more Thai.</v>

1781
01:25:13.790 --> 01:25:14.920
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before that,</v>

1782
01:25:15.140 --> 01:25:16.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were all up in crunch,</v>

1783
01:25:16.990 --> 01:25:17.823
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1784
01:25:17.900 --> 01:25:19.480
<v Speaker 2>training and then they opened up the</v>
<v Speaker 2>school,</v>

1785
01:25:19.481 --> 01:25:21.670
<v Speaker 2>but he was there and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yo,</v>

1786
01:25:21.671 --> 01:25:25.960
<v Speaker 2>I want to do this ironman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He started training me from day one to</v>

1787
01:25:25.961 --> 01:25:29.530
<v Speaker 2>do my first race.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started with him and in 2010 I did my</v>

1788
01:25:29.531 --> 01:25:31.380
<v Speaker 2>first race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2012 New York,</v>

1789
01:25:31.650 --> 01:25:34.930
<v Speaker 2>New York iron man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then his whole journey,</v>

1790
01:25:34.931 --> 01:25:38.480
<v Speaker 2>now they open up this place recoveries</v>
<v Speaker 2>right up the block from Hansel Gracie's</v>

1791
01:25:38.490 --> 01:25:39.820
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on 30th street.</v>

1792
01:25:40.420 --> 01:25:45.160
<v Speaker 2>So they have to see Vac pod which takes</v>
<v Speaker 2>you to elevation and increases your vo</v>

1793
01:25:45.161 --> 01:25:47.500
<v Speaker 2>two Max by like five point eight</v>
<v Speaker 2>percent.</v>

1794
01:25:47.650 --> 01:25:52.030
<v Speaker 2>And I think doping doing the EPO and</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything only gives you three percent.</v>

1795
01:25:53.020 --> 01:25:57.370
<v Speaker 2>And then he does the Neukom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now I tried to test the shit and I'm</v>

1796
01:25:57.371 --> 01:25:57.970
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alright,</v>

1797
01:25:57.970 --> 01:26:02.170
<v Speaker 2>Neukom it fucking works with the wiring</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your brain.</v>

1798
01:26:02.171 --> 01:26:04.070
<v Speaker 2>So you put this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these fucking,</v>

1799
01:26:04.130 --> 01:26:07.850
<v Speaker 4>you put blinders on and you sit there</v>
<v Speaker 4>with these fucking headphones and he has</v>

1800
01:26:07.851 --> 01:26:11.150
<v Speaker 4>electrodes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He puts this gel by the way.</v>

1801
01:26:11.210 --> 01:26:15.490
<v Speaker 4>I have his card and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you come to New York next time for</v>

1802

<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1807
01:26:27.510 --> 01:26:30.650
<v Speaker 4>the sound vibration that's coming</v>
<v Speaker 4>through these headphones,</v>

01:27:19.071 --> 01:27:21.830
<v Speaker 4>that's a go at that are going in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How does it work?</v>

1826
01:27:21.831 --> 01:27:23.080
<v Speaker 4>Then?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's electrodes that are on,</v>

1827
01:27:23.420 --> 01:27:25.580
<v Speaker 4>he puts like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you have a tens machine,</v>

1828
01:27:25.581 --> 01:27:26.390
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a day.</v>

1829
01:27:26.390 --> 01:27:28.550
<v Speaker 4>The gluey fucking pads,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1830
01:27:28.551 --> 01:27:32.540
<v Speaker 4>So it's the squares and then he puts</v>
<v Speaker 4>this gel and he puts it behind</v>

1831
01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:35.960
<v Speaker 4>productive gel and he puts it behind</v>
<v Speaker 4>your ear here.</v>

1832
01:27:36.500 --> 01:27:39.080
<v Speaker 4>And then the headphones and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>blinders.</v>

1833
01:27:39.410 --> 01:27:43.850
<v Speaker 4>But it's sending a pulse into your body</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the sound vibrations at attached to</v>

1834
01:27:43.851 --> 01:27:44.990
<v Speaker 4>a big machine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>

1835
01:27:44.991 --> 01:27:46.940
<v Speaker 4>it's a fucking little machine like this.</v>

1836
01:27:46.940 --> 01:27:48.110
<v Speaker 4>So it's something that we could have</v>
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>

1837
01:27:48.111 --> 01:27:48.621
<v Speaker 4>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1838
01:27:48.621 --> 01:27:50.390
<v Speaker 4>you can have it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm telling you,</v>

1839
01:27:50.391 --> 01:27:51.890
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you will bug the fuck out.</v>

1840
01:27:51.950 --> 01:27:54.350
<v Speaker 4>That sounds crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he's an expert in it.</v>

1841
01:27:54.351 --> 01:27:58.220
<v Speaker 4>Like the guy who manages the whole shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's an expert in the new comp stuff,</v>

1842
01:27:58.250 --> 01:27:59.740
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so like,</v>

1843
01:27:59.990 --> 01:28:02.390
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a big fan of yours by the way too.</v>

1844
01:28:02.410 --> 01:28:05.270
<v Speaker 4>He got out to Aaron.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this is it right here.</v>

1845
01:28:05.610 --> 01:28:07.160
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so when you put this on,</v>

1846
01:28:08.630 --> 01:28:13.280
<v Speaker 4>is it on a timer like it's over when</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's over?</v>

1847
01:28:13.350 --> 01:28:14.930
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they had to wake me up,</v>

1848
01:28:14.931 --> 01:28:17.030
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a those pads.</v>

1849
01:28:17.090 --> 01:28:20.160
<v Speaker 4>They woke me to fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought I was out for like 15 minutes.</v>

1850
01:28:20.161 --> 01:28:24.970
<v Speaker 4>Step two microcurrent stimulation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Step two for newcomb is to.</v>

1851
01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:29.420
<v Speaker 4>Is to use a sub sensory microcurrent to</v>
<v Speaker 4>catalyze the effectiveness of the new</v>

1852
01:28:29.421 --> 01:28:32.630
<v Speaker 4>comp supplementation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you take pills with it to know I</v>

1853
01:28:32.631 --> 01:28:34.360
<v Speaker 4>didn't take any pills.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just.</v>

1854
01:28:34.730 --> 01:28:39.200
<v Speaker 4>The combination of the supplementation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the micro current works on the midbrain</v>

1855
01:28:39.201 --> 01:28:41.230
<v Speaker 4>to interrupt the body's natural sleep</v>
<v Speaker 4>stress.</v>

1856
01:28:41.330 --> 01:28:44.660
<v Speaker 4>Natural stress response.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Research shows this microcurrent helps</v>

1857
01:28:44.661 --> 01:28:48.950
<v Speaker 4>balance the brain's neurochemistry by</v>
<v Speaker 4>reestablishing optimal neurotransmitter</v>

1858
01:28:48.951 --> 01:28:52.340
<v Speaker 4>levels.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You won't feel it in Swahili as far as</v>

1859
01:28:52.510 --> 01:28:54.180
<v Speaker 4>that should help.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The way your brain works.</v>

1860
01:28:54.630 --> 01:28:56.390
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's insane dude.</v>

1861
01:28:56.410 --> 01:29:00.380
<v Speaker 4>And and they're the only,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the only ones in New York that are</v>

1862
01:29:00.381 --> 01:29:02.160
<v Speaker 4>doing a new calm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're the only ones</v>

1863
01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:06.270
<v Speaker 2>in the east coast that have a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>evac pod.</v>

1864
01:29:06.780 --> 01:29:10.170
<v Speaker 2>One of the universities out here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've got one in Orange County.</v>

1865
01:29:10.830 --> 01:29:12.600
<v Speaker 2>Ian Mccall was using that shift for</v>
<v Speaker 2>awhile.</v>

1866
01:29:12.810 --> 01:29:16.410
<v Speaker 2>He said great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the woman who holds the world record</v>

1867
01:29:16.860 --> 01:29:21.390
<v Speaker 2>time trial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe she was doing see vac the pod.</v>

1868
01:29:21.810 --> 01:29:25.590
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go in this thing and it's like,</v>

1869
01:29:25.700 --> 01:29:26.210
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1870
01:29:26.210 --> 01:29:28.410
<v Speaker 2>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to work up because you can't</v>

1871
01:29:28.411 --> 01:29:30.440
<v Speaker 2>just go to level five and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you,</v>

1872
01:29:30.450 --> 01:29:31.830
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you fucking shit.</v>

1873
01:29:31.831 --> 01:29:35.550
<v Speaker 2>We'll just bug the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I worked all the way up to level</v>

1874
01:29:35.551 --> 01:29:38.340
<v Speaker 2>five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But how long did it take you to work up</v>

1875
01:29:38.341 --> 01:29:40.440
<v Speaker 2>to?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It took me like a couple of weeks,</v>

1876
01:29:40.490 --> 01:29:43.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like what I really noticed was with</v>

1877
01:29:43.621 --> 01:29:48.000
<v Speaker 2>my running because I mark my threshold</v>
<v Speaker 2>and everything,</v>

1878
01:29:48.001 --> 01:29:50.820
<v Speaker 2>so every run when I was training for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>last race,</v>

1879
01:29:50.821 --> 01:29:54.300
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just did Chattanooga a half ironman.</v>

1880
01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:59.480
<v Speaker 2>So every run I was doing it's going in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the back and then go in and do the new</v>

1881
01:29:59.701 --> 01:30:01.910
<v Speaker 2>calm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I do the normatec boots.</v>

1882
01:30:01.911 --> 01:30:05.130
<v Speaker 2>Like they have everything at this place</v>
<v Speaker 2>recover,</v>

1883
01:30:05.370 --> 01:30:10.370
<v Speaker 2>so like they're just using and then they</v>
<v Speaker 2>have this other fucking magnetic blanket</v>

1884
01:30:10.980 --> 01:30:15.540
<v Speaker 2>that fucking you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you sit on it and then his isolation pad</v>

1885
01:30:15.541 --> 01:30:18.690
<v Speaker 2>on top and it sends these frequencies</v>
<v Speaker 2>through your body.</v>

1886
01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:19.710
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done that wasn't mean,</v>

1887
01:30:19.711 --> 01:30:24.711
<v Speaker 2>what does that call fucking I'm spacing</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the cryo place and they're getting,</v>

1888
01:30:25.711 --> 01:30:28.440
<v Speaker 2>they got cryo coming down and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1889
01:30:28.570 --> 01:30:33.460
<v Speaker 2>and it just flushed like I've noticed</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I can go fucking hardest.</v>

1890
01:30:33.530 --> 01:30:38.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean I would have to bike 120 miles</v>
<v Speaker 2>and do a brick and get off the bike and</v>

1891
01:30:38.851 --> 01:30:43.851
<v Speaker 2>go run 13 miles and I'm like fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>breaking threshold fucking records</v>

1892
01:30:44.050 --> 01:30:49.050
<v Speaker 2>because I started taking up any athlete</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's serious about even handles,</v>

1893
01:30:50.550 --> 01:30:54.090
<v Speaker 2>I think it was his nephew is something</v>
<v Speaker 2>that just had that fight.</v>

1894
01:30:54.930 --> 01:30:56.760
<v Speaker 2>The coach was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1895
01:30:56.850 --> 01:31:00.300
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's coming into the evac twice,</v>

1896
01:31:00.301 --> 01:31:02.220
<v Speaker 2>three times a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

1897
01:31:02.221 --> 01:31:02.821
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

1898
01:31:02.821 --> 01:31:04.320
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he his gas tank.</v>

1899
01:31:04.321 --> 01:31:05.910
<v Speaker 2>He just doesn't run out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's just,</v>

1900
01:31:06.270 --> 01:31:10.080
<v Speaker 2>he's fucking grappling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's doing everything and he's never</v>

1901
01:31:10.081 --> 01:31:11.040
<v Speaker 2>fucking tired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

1902
01:31:11.041 --> 01:31:13.470
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen him perform at this</v>
<v Speaker 2>level.</v>

1903
01:31:13.740 --> 01:31:16.290
<v Speaker 2>So the success is there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even this woman,</v>

1904
01:31:16.291 --> 01:31:20.400
<v Speaker 2>she broke the world record,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was for tt time trial or</v>

1905
01:31:20.401 --> 01:31:23.760
<v Speaker 2>track or road or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This woman's cycle is,</v>

1906
01:31:23.910 --> 01:31:28.350
<v Speaker 2>did see vac and she and they accused her</v>
<v Speaker 2>of fucking doping.</v>

1907
01:31:28.380 --> 01:31:29.840
<v Speaker 2>That's at the banner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yammer.</v>

1908
01:31:29.880 --> 01:31:34.110
<v Speaker 2>Physical fucking legit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have that there too.</v>

1909
01:31:34.190 --> 01:31:36.900
<v Speaker 2>It does something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does something because,</v>

1910
01:31:36.901 --> 01:31:37.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been,</v>

1911
01:31:37.770 --> 01:31:39.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're always getting hurt,</v>

1912
01:31:39.061 --> 01:31:41.370
<v Speaker 2>you know that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm always dealing with a fucking</v>

1913
01:31:41.380 --> 01:31:44.930
<v Speaker 2>nagging fucking injury.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got something now like a growing</v>

1914
01:31:44.980 --> 01:31:45.400
<v Speaker 2>issue?</v>

1915
01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:46.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1916
01:31:46.951 --> 01:31:47.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1917
01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:47.920
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1918
01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:49.150
<v Speaker 2>I've never had a race.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1919
01:31:49.151 --> 01:31:51.960
<v Speaker 2>I've got my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got my nose broken Cabo ironman.</v>

1920
01:31:51.990 --> 01:31:54.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm swimming out in shark infested</v>
<v Speaker 2>waters.</v>

1921
01:31:54.091 --> 01:31:57.540
<v Speaker 2>Fucking leaking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But even from boxing I knew,</v>

1922
01:31:57.541 --> 01:32:00.010
<v Speaker 2>don't blow your nose because your eyes</v>
<v Speaker 2>are going to swell shut.</v>

1923
01:32:00.011 --> 01:32:01.420
<v Speaker 2>So I had to do all mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

1924
01:32:01.421 --> 01:32:04.570
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my first ironman I ever did was New York</v>

1925
01:32:04.570 --> 01:32:07.990
<v Speaker 2>City and a chromosome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The drama mackey book,</v>

1926
01:32:07.991 --> 01:32:09.910
<v Speaker 2>the fucking show.</v>

1928
01:32:12.010 --> 01:32:15.070
<v Speaker 2>So we play to like 3000 motherfuckers</v>
<v Speaker 2>going off.</v>

1929
01:32:15.071 --> 01:32:20.071
<v Speaker 2>You know that whole mosh and shit and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking lay it down and I fucking had my</v>

1930
01:32:21.401 --> 01:32:23.770
<v Speaker 2>brother come down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He drove me back to New York City.</v>

1931
01:32:23.771 --> 01:32:28.270
<v Speaker 2>I had a stress fracture in my foot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I took a shower and I went to the swim</v>

1932
01:32:28.271 --> 01:32:31.030
<v Speaker 2>start and I did an ironman in August</v>
<v Speaker 2>twelfth,</v>

1933
01:32:31.480 --> 01:32:36.480
<v Speaker 2>2012 in fucking 95 degrees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>New York city humidity.</v>

1934
01:32:37.240 --> 01:32:40.900
<v Speaker 2>But I was not going to be an extra in</v>
<v Speaker 2>your foot.</v>

1935
01:32:40.930 --> 01:32:44.470
<v Speaker 2>Stress fracture in my fucking foot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the thing is right where the cleat</v>

1936
01:32:44.471 --> 01:32:46.060
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where it pressed.</v>

1937
01:32:46.090 --> 01:32:49.420
<v Speaker 2>That's where my stress fracture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the second metatarsal.</v>

1938
01:32:49.421 --> 01:32:51.730
<v Speaker 2>And it was just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I didn't take aspirin.</v>

1939
01:32:51.731 --> 01:32:53.680
<v Speaker 2>I didn't take nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just like,</v>

1940
01:32:54.190 --> 01:32:57.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>videos like David Goggins volcano,</v>

1941
01:32:57.570 --> 01:32:59.420
<v Speaker 2>that fucking maniac.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1942
01:32:59.710 --> 01:33:01.420
<v Speaker 2>fuck my pain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1943
01:33:02.290 --> 01:33:05.710
<v Speaker 2>it took me 13 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how long did it take you to get over</v>

1944
01:33:05.711 --> 01:33:08.530
<v Speaker 2>the stress?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It took months.</v>

1945
01:33:08.830 --> 01:33:11.520
<v Speaker 2>It took months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why I started wearing hocus.</v>

1946
01:33:11.560 --> 01:33:16.560
<v Speaker 2>Now I run with Hoka,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hoka Hoka these shoes and there's other</v>

1947
01:33:17.830 --> 01:33:21.130
<v Speaker 2>big patents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's like a two inch pad.</v>

1948
01:33:21.510 --> 01:33:23.980
<v Speaker 2>What is the day your shoe goes down in</v>
<v Speaker 2>there?</v>

1949
01:33:23.981 --> 01:33:28.690
<v Speaker 2>It's not actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's this scientifically designed</v>

1950
01:33:28.691 --> 01:33:32.320
<v Speaker 2>foam that absorbs shock from the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the road.</v>

1951
01:33:32.780 --> 01:33:33.630
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1952
01:33:34.330 --> 01:33:37.030
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the top heather Jackson runs in</v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

1953
01:33:37.390 --> 01:33:39.460
<v Speaker 2>She just fucking has been winning like</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>

1954
01:33:39.461 --> 01:33:41.320
<v Speaker 2>She was just so fucking better</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christian,</v>

1955
01:33:41.321 --> 01:33:43.240
<v Speaker 2>a better cushion and when you get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1956
01:33:43.241 --> 01:33:48.241
<v Speaker 2>I'm 56 so it's like I'm not a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude that's recovering so quick as I</v>

1957
01:33:48.311 --> 01:33:52.240
<v Speaker 2>used to in my twenties or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I might fuck with barefoot running</v>

1958
01:33:52.241 --> 01:33:53.260
<v Speaker 2>shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>

1959
01:33:53.261 --> 01:33:53.680
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1960
01:33:53.680 --> 01:33:55.630
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no cushioning.</v>

1961
01:33:55.631 --> 01:33:57.310
<v Speaker 2>I just can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you're running.</v>

1962
01:33:57.350 --> 01:34:02.350
<v Speaker 2>Do you do a lot of your run on some may</v>
<v Speaker 2>need some time in New York.</v>

1963
01:34:02.450 --> 01:34:05.440
<v Speaker 2>I live in New York City.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might run the trail,</v>

1964
01:34:05.740 --> 01:34:08.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bridle trail in central park if I</v>

1965
01:34:08.801 --> 01:34:12.910
<v Speaker 2>can or run around the reservoir.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But mostly my shit is all in the city</v>

1966
01:34:12.911 --> 01:34:16.230
<v Speaker 2>and the hope is just fucking like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1967
01:34:16.300 --> 01:34:19.360
<v Speaker 2>I'll be the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People say to me,</v>

1968
01:34:19.361 --> 01:34:21.330
<v Speaker 2>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you must be fucked up for a week after</v>

1969
01:34:21.331 --> 01:34:22.164
<v Speaker 2>the race.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1970
01:34:22.930 --> 01:34:27.250
<v Speaker 2>I did Conan world championships two</v>
<v Speaker 2>years in a row and the first year I did</v>

1971
01:34:27.251 --> 01:34:32.251
<v Speaker 2>it 2016,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fucking went snorkeling with my girl</v>

1972
01:34:32.291 --> 01:34:33.850
<v Speaker 2>the next day for like three hours.</v>

1973
01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:39.600
<v Speaker 2>So like the inflammation's not there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting really dialed in on the</v>

1974
01:34:40.570 --> 01:34:43.510
<v Speaker 2>equipment aspect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting fitted for the bike,</v>

1975
01:34:43.511 --> 01:34:48.511
<v Speaker 2>getting the right shoes to run in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It literally took me six years to get</v>

1976
01:34:49.781 --> 01:34:53.620
<v Speaker 2>dialed in on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on even the nutrition aspect and doing</v>

1977
01:34:53.621 --> 01:34:58.490
<v Speaker 2>them racist because you don't want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get a belly full of fucking gels and all</v>

1978
01:34:58.491 --> 01:35:00.370
<v Speaker 2>this other shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1979
01:35:00.380 --> 01:35:04.460
<v Speaker 2>so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the recovery aspect of,</v>

1980
01:35:04.490 --> 01:35:07.340
<v Speaker 2>of what I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I just watched,</v>

1981
01:35:07.341 --> 01:35:10.160
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>coggins was on the rich roll podcast and</v>

1982
01:35:10.161 --> 01:35:14.000
<v Speaker 2>he was talking about how much yoga and</v>
<v Speaker 2>stretching that he's doing now.</v>

1983
01:35:14.060 --> 01:35:14.930
<v Speaker 2>Two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>

1984
01:35:14.931 --> 01:35:19.730
<v Speaker 2>four hours of fucking street.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I know you're into yoga lover.</v>

1985
01:35:19.820 --> 01:35:21.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking great.</v>

1986
01:35:21.171 --> 01:35:23.660
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I need to start getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>back into my girl.</v>

1987
01:35:23.661 --> 01:35:26.810
<v Speaker 2>Erica is always pushing me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's like fucking bought me,</v>

1988
01:35:26.811 --> 01:35:27.644
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1989
01:35:28.010 --> 01:35:33.010
<v Speaker 2>a kiosk thing for fucking integral yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she bought that shift for me last</v>

1990
01:35:33.140 --> 01:35:33.973
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still,</v>

1991
01:35:35.240 --> 01:35:36.073
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1992
01:35:36.200 --> 01:35:38.420
<v Speaker 2>it's what you resist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you read,</v>

1993
01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:44.720
<v Speaker 2>have you read the war of art by Steven?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fucking love it.</v>

1994
01:35:45.230 --> 01:35:46.063
<v Speaker 2>You have in mind,</v>

1995
01:35:47.110 --> 01:35:50.230
<v Speaker 3>I bought a stack of his books.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to give them out to my guests</v>

1996
01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:53.140
<v Speaker 3>don't take</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that are</v>

1997
01:35:53.370 --> 01:35:55.290
<v Speaker 2>the war of art,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do the work.</v>

1998
01:35:55.650 --> 01:35:59.460
<v Speaker 2>But he talked about resistance and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>main thing about resistance is usually</v>

1999
01:35:59.461 --> 01:36:02.070
<v Speaker 2>we're the most resistant to things we</v>
<v Speaker 2>need the most.</v>

2000
01:36:02.100 --> 01:36:03.090
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2001
01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:05.460
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's this deep shit.</v>

2002
01:36:05.461 --> 01:36:09.990
<v Speaker 2>That book I was grateful every morning I</v>
<v Speaker 2>sit down to write my screenplay or my</v>

2003
01:36:09.991 --> 01:36:12.180
<v Speaker 2>next book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read his shit,</v>

2004
01:36:12.580 --> 01:36:13.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's just.</v>

2005
01:36:13.980 --> 01:36:16.730
<v Speaker 2>And the four agreements,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm big into two.</v>

2006
01:36:17.070 --> 01:36:22.070
<v Speaker 2>I went to actually somebody got me</v>
<v Speaker 2>tickets to see a Miguel speak,</v>

2007
01:36:22.650 --> 01:36:25.920
<v Speaker 2>Don Miguel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was a life changing encounter for</v>

2008
01:36:25.921 --> 01:36:27.150
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The four agreements,</v>

2009
01:36:27.330 --> 01:36:29.550
<v Speaker 2>don't take things personal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>always do your best,</v>

2010
01:36:29.910 --> 01:36:32.970
<v Speaker 2>be impeccable with your word and don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>make assumptions.</v>

2011
01:36:32.971 --> 01:36:36.420
<v Speaker 2>Which I always thought I've created wars</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my fucking mind.</v>

2012
01:36:36.960 --> 01:36:38.190
<v Speaker 2>And then they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

2013
01:36:38.191 --> 01:36:40.520
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't even taking that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck is your problem?</v>

2014
01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:45.510
<v Speaker 2>That's classic fucking Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that shit is fucking crazy man.</v>

2015
01:36:45.990 --> 01:36:50.430
<v Speaker 2>And I think if everybody just slowed</v>
<v Speaker 2>down and read some literature on some of</v>

2016
01:36:50.431 --> 01:36:54.780
<v Speaker 2>these teachers that</v>
<v Speaker 2>humanity could do so,</v>

2017
01:36:54.840 --> 01:36:55.330
<v Speaker 2>so much</v>

2018
01:36:55.330 --> 01:36:57.130
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

2019
01:36:57.610 --> 01:37:01.000
<v Speaker 3>Pressfield's great man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what he does say about resistance is</v>

2020
01:37:01.001 --> 01:37:02.950
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so powerful because there there is</v>

2021
01:37:02.951 --> 01:37:05.860
<v Speaker 3>something that keeps you from doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that you know you're supposed to</v>

2022
01:37:05.861 --> 01:37:08.230
<v Speaker 3>do and when you do them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you feel so much better.</v>

2023
01:37:08.231 --> 01:37:09.610
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why didn't I just do it?</v>

2024
01:37:09.780 --> 01:37:12.670
<v Speaker 3>Why did it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was all this procrastination and</v>

2025
01:37:12.671 --> 01:37:16.420
<v Speaker 3>bullshit that was involved in me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like putting this off and then when you</v>

2026
01:37:16.421 --> 01:37:18.630
<v Speaker 3>finally do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every time I walk out of a yoga class,</v>

2027
01:37:18.631 --> 01:37:20.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I gotta do that again tomorrow.</v>

2028
01:37:20.310 --> 01:37:23.020
<v Speaker 3>I got to keep this ball rolling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a part of my life.</v>

2029
01:37:23.410 --> 01:37:26.110
<v Speaker 3>I got to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially for a guy like you because</v>

2030
01:37:26.111 --> 01:37:29.440
<v Speaker 3>everything is tight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nino's racing and running and</v>

2031
01:37:29.441 --> 01:37:31.300
<v Speaker 3>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then when you're on stage,</v>

2032
01:37:31.301 --> 01:37:33.070
<v Speaker 3>everything is crushed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>crushed,</v>

2033
01:37:33.100 --> 01:37:34.030
<v Speaker 3>crushed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>crushed,</v>

2034
01:37:34.310 --> 01:37:35.110
<v Speaker 3>destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2035
01:37:35.110 --> 01:37:37.870
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the thing about yoga is that</v>

2036
01:37:37.880 --> 01:37:41.740
<v Speaker 3>static,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these poses and stretches and your core</v>

2037
01:37:41.741 --> 01:37:44.500
<v Speaker 3>gets activated and everything gets</v>
<v Speaker 3>lengthened.</v>

2038
01:37:44.501 --> 01:37:46.350
<v Speaker 3>It's just smart way to make it.</v>

2039
01:37:46.660 --> 01:37:47.760
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what it is.</v>

2040
01:37:47.770 --> 01:37:49.690
<v Speaker 2>I try to justify it by going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2041
01:37:49.691 --> 01:37:53.920
<v Speaker 2>I do yoga at the gym when you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'll do my trigger point and</v>

2042
01:37:53.921 --> 01:37:56.790
<v Speaker 2>then I do all my trigger point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>myofascial release,</v>

2043
01:37:56.791 --> 01:37:59.160
<v Speaker 2>all that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then last 15 minutes my girls like</v>

2044
01:37:59.161 --> 01:38:01.800
<v Speaker 2>that shit don't count.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then it's better than nothing.</v>

2045
01:38:01.830 --> 01:38:02.890
<v Speaker 2>You need to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2046
01:38:02.940 --> 01:38:06.840
<v Speaker 2>but I remember how I used to feel when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>would come out of those yoga classes in</v>

2047
01:38:06.850 --> 01:38:09.300
<v Speaker 2>81 and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would feel like I could jump over a</v>

2048
01:38:09.301 --> 01:38:12.750
<v Speaker 2>fucking building and I need need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to get back to that.</v>

2049
01:38:12.930 --> 01:38:17.930
<v Speaker 2>But even in the resistance aspect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what not doing what you resistant and it</v>

2050
01:38:19.111 --> 01:38:20.100
<v Speaker 2>could be something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2051
01:38:20.101 --> 01:38:23.700

<v Speaker 2>fucking straighten out the papers on my</v>

2052
01:38:23.701 --> 01:38:26.490
<v Speaker 2>desk and go to all this shit and if I</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't do it,</v>

2053

<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

2054
01:38:29.010 --> 01:38:33.260
<v Speaker 2>Because that's what resistance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you cave in and you give into</v>

2055
01:38:33.270 --> 01:38:34.350
<v Speaker 2>resistance,</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's part of the Puranas is called the</v>
<v Speaker 2>spotless Paranas,</v>

2101
01:40:29.641 --> 01:40:33.120
<v Speaker 2>so there's 10 days of the book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 candles he didn't even have.</v>

2102
01:40:33.180 --> 01:40:38.010
<v Speaker 2>He brought the original texts that have</v>
<v Speaker 2>been passed down from one teacher to the</v>

2103
01:40:38.010 --> 01:40:39.210

<v Speaker 2>to the next in India,</v>

2104
01:40:39.540 --> 01:40:42.780

<v Speaker 2>Bhaktisiddhanta said,</v>

01:40:43.140 --> 01:40:47.070
<v Speaker 2>you need to write these books in English</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the world to help the world,</v>

2106

<v Speaker 2>You're at the end of your life.</v>

2108
01:40:53.171 --> 01:40:55.600
<v Speaker 2>Why are you going to go to America?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very dangerous place,</v>

2109
01:40:55.601 --> 01:40:58.930
<v Speaker 2>not only to go to America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He went to fucking New York to the</v>

2110
01:40:58.931 --> 01:41:00.340
<v Speaker 2>bowery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They robbed him.</v>

2111
01:41:00.400 --> 01:41:02.710
<v Speaker 2>He slept on the floor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He Fed people.</v>

2112
01:41:02.770 --> 01:41:06.940
<v Speaker 2>He cooked me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alan Ginsburg Academy's first storefront</v>

2113
01:41:07.240 --> 01:41:11.980
<v Speaker 2>over there called matches gifts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they saw the humility of this person</v>

2114
01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:15.700
<v Speaker 2>probably pod and what he did for people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How he has so much love.</v>

2115
01:41:15.701 --> 01:41:19.480
<v Speaker 2>He would cook the meals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>serve everybody clean up before you</v>

2116
01:41:19.481 --> 01:41:22.300
<v Speaker 2>would even eat a grain and rice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had no possessions,</v>

2117
01:41:22.330 --> 01:41:22.840
<v Speaker 2>none.</v>

2118
01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:27.840
<v Speaker 2>He slept on the floor on a mat and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>saw the humility of him and he just.</v>

2119
01:41:28.430 --> 01:41:31.750
<v Speaker 2>And when I learned this story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a great documentary on him</v>

2120
01:41:31.751 --> 01:41:36.190
<v Speaker 2>called you're ever well wisher on</v>
<v Speaker 2>youtube and it's about his life and how</v>

2121
01:41:36.191 --> 01:41:38.620
<v Speaker 2>he came and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2122
01:41:38.621 --> 01:41:42.130
<v Speaker 2>Charya means one who leads by example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not what,</v>

2123
01:41:42.160 --> 01:41:45.580
<v Speaker 2>and I've learned this just by these big</v>
<v Speaker 2>mounds that are out there that talked so</v>

2124
01:41:45.581 --> 01:41:46.840
<v Speaker 2>much shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It ain't,</v>

2125
01:41:46.841 --> 01:41:48.820
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's what you do.</v>

2126
01:41:49.090 --> 01:41:53.050
<v Speaker 2>It's about your action and your words</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how you interact with other people</v>

2127
01:41:53.230 --> 01:41:57.190
<v Speaker 2>and how you see other people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even these fucking so-called celebrities</v>

2128
01:41:57.460 --> 01:42:00.130
<v Speaker 2>is when the camera's ain't on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you treat people,</v>

2129
01:42:00.580 --> 01:42:02.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is the real core of your</v>

2130
01:42:02.831 --> 01:42:04.660
<v Speaker 2>existence?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you here to do?</v>

2131
01:42:05.230 --> 01:42:07.960
<v Speaker 2>And when I saw a proud part and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2132
01:42:07.961 --> 01:42:08.794
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2133
01:42:09.250 --> 01:42:11.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>read all this stuff on him and then</v>

2134
01:42:11.741 --> 01:42:13.990
<v Speaker 2>started taking up the process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2135
01:42:14.470 --> 01:42:15.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2136
01:42:15.820 --> 01:42:18.790
<v Speaker 2>it just changed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>changed my life so that you know,</v>

2137
01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:20.500
<v Speaker 2>for the better so</v>

2138
01:42:21.130 --> 01:42:24.880
<v Speaker 3>well by you saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was very enticing for people,</v>

2139
01:42:24.910 --> 01:42:26.710
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the guy I want to do what he's</v>

2140
01:42:26.711 --> 01:42:28.450
<v Speaker 3>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanna I want to feel better,</v>

2141
01:42:28.451 --> 01:42:31.690
<v Speaker 3>like he's feeling better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what's amazing about having</v>

2142
01:42:31.691 --> 01:42:35.770
<v Speaker 3>someone who's a great role model,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning like me.</v>

2143
01:42:35.830 --> 01:42:37.690
<v Speaker 3>You might not even think of yourself as</v>
<v Speaker 3>a role model,</v>

2144
01:42:37.691 --> 01:42:41.560
<v Speaker 3>but by living your life by example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by doing things that you should do,</v>

2145
01:42:41.561 --> 01:42:44.680
<v Speaker 3>but being healthy by being active and</v>
<v Speaker 3>enthusiastic,</v>

2146
01:42:44.950 --> 01:42:48.130
<v Speaker 3>but you've got passionate about what</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're doing about your music,</v>

2147
01:42:48.131 --> 01:42:50.050
<v Speaker 3>about pushing yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about your books,</v>

2148
01:42:50.051 --> 01:42:53.320
<v Speaker 3>about the exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you do that,</v>

2149
01:42:53.650 --> 01:42:55.330
<v Speaker 3>people that don't have purpose in their</v>
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>

2150
01:42:55.331 --> 01:42:57.280
<v Speaker 3>they see that and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I'm missing.</v>

2151
01:42:57.281 --> 01:42:59.860
<v Speaker 3>I'm missing because we're missing so</v>
<v Speaker 3>many things in this life.</v>

2152
01:43:00.040 --> 01:43:02.320
<v Speaker 3>But one of the things that people are</v>
<v Speaker 3>missing is role models.</v>

2153
01:43:02.350 --> 01:43:04.750
<v Speaker 3>They're missing someone who they can</v>
<v Speaker 3>look up to and go,</v>

2154
01:43:04.751 --> 01:43:05.530
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>

2155
01:43:05.530 --> 01:43:06.540
<v Speaker 3>This is the way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it.</v>

2156
01:43:06.710 --> 01:43:10.360
<v Speaker 3>And when you emulate their lifestyle and</v>
<v Speaker 3>start thinking the way they think and</v>

2157
01:43:10.630 --> 01:43:13.150
<v Speaker 3>using their lessons and applying them to</v>
<v Speaker 3>your own life,</v>

2158
01:43:13.151 --> 01:43:18.151
<v Speaker 3>you start seeing benefits and then that</v>
<v Speaker 3>passes down to other people who see you.</v>

2159
01:43:19.230 --> 01:43:21.630
<v Speaker 2>It's like a candle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One candle can light up.</v>

2160
01:43:21.990 --> 01:43:26.130
<v Speaker 2>Like hr was that for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like her could have been telling me to</v>

2161
01:43:26.131 --> 01:43:28.770
<v Speaker 2>worship fucking cheetos and and I would</v>
<v Speaker 2>have done it.</v>

2162
01:43:28.771 --> 01:43:32.880
<v Speaker 2>Thankfully he was into the right shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I would see him go on stage and I</v>

2163

<v Speaker 2>up stupid shit in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I'm still trying to write a,</v>

<v Speaker 2>the karmic scales for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my work will never be done until the</v>

2311
01:50:13.181 --> 01:50:16.150
<v Speaker 2>last breath I take in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in his lifetime.</v>

2312
01:50:16.151 --> 01:50:18.160
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to help trying to help</v>

2313
01:50:18.161 --> 01:50:19.810
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2314
01:50:19.840 --> 01:50:22.570
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by whatever methods I can,</v>

2315
01:50:22.571 --> 01:50:23.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what.</v>

2316
01:50:23.640 --> 01:50:24.900
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a beautiful path,</v>

2317
01:50:24.901 --> 01:50:25.411
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2318
01:50:25.411 --> 01:50:28.530
<v Speaker 3>you've turned a terrible situation and a</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible,</v>

2319
01:50:28.560 --> 01:50:33.560
<v Speaker 3>terrible circumstances into a way that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've created now where you're</v>

2320
01:50:33.720 --> 01:50:36.750
<v Speaker 3>inspiring people all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's very positive.</v>

2321
01:50:36.780 --> 01:50:39.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just the impact that you have.</v>

2322
01:50:39.480 --> 01:50:42.300
<v Speaker 3>I think one of the things that we were</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about earlier about all the</v>

2323
01:50:42.301 --> 01:50:46.410
<v Speaker 3>negativity that people have online.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think part of the problem with that is</v>

2324
01:50:46.950 --> 01:50:49.980
<v Speaker 3>I don't think people totally understand</v>
<v Speaker 3>communication.</v>

2325
01:50:49.981 --> 01:50:54.420
<v Speaker 3>I think what we're handed is these tools</v>
<v Speaker 3>to distribute our thoughts and our</v>

2326
01:50:54.421 --> 01:50:58.800
<v Speaker 3>information and we're trying to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>rudimentary reactions and we're not</v>

2327
01:50:58.980 --> 01:51:03.810
<v Speaker 3>understanding that these reactions don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>just stop with the person that we're</v>

2328
01:51:03.811 --> 01:51:06.300
<v Speaker 3>interacting with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They affect ourselves because they</v>

2329
01:51:06.301 --> 01:51:09.990
<v Speaker 3>affect how we feel about ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you write some petty shit about</v>

2330
01:51:09.991 --> 01:51:12.420
<v Speaker 3>someone you don't respect yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2331
01:51:12.540 --> 01:51:14.370
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you write some nasty,</v>

2332
01:51:14.371 --> 01:51:17.100
<v Speaker 3>snarky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>petty shit about someone and you're</v>

2333
01:51:17.101 --> 01:51:20.520
<v Speaker 3>insulting for no reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know you're insulting for no reason</v>

2334
01:51:20.521 --> 01:51:21.720
<v Speaker 3>and you feel it yourself.</v>

2335
01:51:21.720 --> 01:51:24.300
<v Speaker 3>You don't have great self respect for</v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself for that,</v>

2336
01:51:24.301 --> 01:51:26.910
<v Speaker 3>and then on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that person that you hurt their</v>

2337
01:51:26.911 --> 01:51:29.280
<v Speaker 3>feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they might perhaps interact with other</v>

2338
01:51:29.281 --> 01:51:31.380
<v Speaker 3>people negatively because of that as</v>
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

2339
01:51:31.381 --> 01:51:35.820
<v Speaker 3>Chain reaction they might get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They might become the first to attack</v>

2340
01:51:35.821 --> 01:51:38.460
<v Speaker 3>next because they'd been attacked before</v>
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>

2341
01:51:38.550 --> 01:51:42.390
<v Speaker 3>so they start acting that way in the for</v>
<v Speaker 3>what it is is a lack of understanding</v>

2342
01:51:42.391 --> 01:51:43.890
<v Speaker 3>that a lot of us have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of us,</v>

2343
01:51:43.891 --> 01:51:47.070
<v Speaker 3>I've been guilty of it to have the</v>
<v Speaker 3>impact that our,</v>

2344
01:51:47.130 --> 01:51:51.390
<v Speaker 3>that our communication has because we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>not thinking about it in a comprehensive</v>

2345
01:51:51.540 --> 01:51:56.160
<v Speaker 3>widescale look with thinking about in</v>
<v Speaker 3>terms of that is annoying to me,</v>

2346
01:51:56.161 --> 01:51:59.430
<v Speaker 3>so I'm going to fuck that guy's world up</v>
<v Speaker 3>by saying shitty things about him and</v>

2347
01:51:59.431 --> 01:52:02.070
<v Speaker 3>his fat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stupid face and whatever you want to say</v>

2348
01:52:02.071 --> 01:52:03.420
<v Speaker 3>about them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And insult them,</v>

2349
01:52:03.740 --> 01:52:04.280
<v Speaker 3>and</v>

2350
01:52:04.280 --> 01:52:06.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to tell you what a lot of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem is too.</v>

2351
01:52:06.890 --> 01:52:11.890
<v Speaker 2>And I see it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're losing the art of even having a</v>

2352
01:52:12.111 --> 01:52:17.111
<v Speaker 2>conversation between human beings</v>
<v Speaker 2>because this is what everybody does when</v>

2353
01:52:17.181 --> 01:52:20.480
<v Speaker 2>you see them going down the</v>
<v Speaker 2>motherfucking street and Yo New York is</v>

2354
01:52:20.481 --> 01:52:23.870
<v Speaker 2>still motherfucker's dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now all these motherfucking texting</v>

2355
01:52:23.871 --> 01:52:27.510
<v Speaker 2>zombies can come out of the club and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they fucking</v>

2356
01:52:29.220 --> 01:52:30.980
<v Speaker 2>rob.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're getting run over there getting</v>

2357
01:52:30.981 --> 01:52:32.540
<v Speaker 2>fucking crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

2358
01:52:32.640 --> 01:52:36.200
<v Speaker 2>But the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is like this right now,</v>

2359
01:52:36.201 --> 01:52:39.440
<v Speaker 2>we have a law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go out with my friend Jake from rocks</v>

2360
01:52:39.441 --> 01:52:42.620
<v Speaker 2>off in New York City.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He does all the rocks off towards it,</v>

2361
01:52:42.621 --> 01:52:44.480
<v Speaker 2>does all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has a role.</v>

2362
01:52:44.570 --> 01:52:48.120
<v Speaker 2>When he out to dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone has to hand them motherfuckers</v>

2363
01:52:48.121 --> 01:52:52.340
<v Speaker 2>cell phone in to the fucking Maitre d</v>
<v Speaker 2>and no cell phones.</v>

2364
01:52:52.490 --> 01:52:54.650
<v Speaker 2>So that you sit there and talk with each</v>
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

2365
01:52:54.650 --> 01:52:58.680
<v Speaker 2>You have the conversation and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is it?</v>

2366
01:52:58.681 --> 01:53:01.400
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw this whole special and it was um,</v>

2367
01:53:02.150 --> 01:53:04.730
<v Speaker 2>it was on CNN and it was Anderson</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cooper.</v>

2368
01:53:04.760 --> 01:53:07.520
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was the guy that was teaching</v>

2369
01:53:07.521 --> 01:53:11.000
<v Speaker 2>mindfulness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget he's been teaching meditation.</v>

2370
01:53:11.001 --> 01:53:14.300
<v Speaker 2>I wrote about him in my book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the whole rule was they had to be</v>

2371
01:53:14.301 --> 01:53:17.720
<v Speaker 2>mindful the entire time that they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>at this thing.</v>

2372
01:53:17.721 --> 01:53:19.430
<v Speaker 2>They had that no cell phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no TV,</v>

2373
01:53:19.431 --> 01:53:22.310
<v Speaker 2>no nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they had to be mindful when they ate</v>

2374
01:53:22.340 --> 01:53:24.200
<v Speaker 2>mindful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they took a shower,</v>

2375
01:53:24.230 --> 01:53:25.760
<v Speaker 2>mindful when they walked down the</v>
<v Speaker 2>street,</v>

2376
01:53:25.850 --> 01:53:30.850
<v Speaker 2>remaining mindful during conversations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>respecting other people and like it was</v>

2377
01:53:33.021 --> 01:53:36.740
<v Speaker 2>heads of the heads,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the CEO of fucking Google and all these</v>

2378
01:53:36.741 --> 01:53:41.741
<v Speaker 2>big companies were there and what they</v>
<v Speaker 2>learned at this retreat for the 10 days</v>

2379
01:53:42.261 --> 01:53:43.820
<v Speaker 2>or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they were there a week.</v>

2380
01:53:44.090 --> 01:53:49.040
<v Speaker 2>It was so powerful that they took that</v>
<v Speaker 2>and implemented that in their companies.</v>

2381
01:53:49.040 --> 01:53:52.490
<v Speaker 2>And now google,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they make everybody sit down and in</v>

2382
01:53:52.491 --> 01:53:57.491
<v Speaker 2>fucking auditorium before they start</v>
<v Speaker 2>their day up there in a silicone valley</v>

2383
01:53:57.921 --> 01:54:01.220
<v Speaker 2>or wherever the fuck they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they have to just sit there for 10</v>

2384
01:54:01.221 --> 01:54:05.210
<v Speaker 2>minutes and be mindful and meditate and</v>
<v Speaker 2>be mindful.</v>

2385
01:54:05.390 --> 01:54:10.390
<v Speaker 2>And that's something that's becoming a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lost part of humanity because it,</v>

2386
01:54:12.140 --> 01:54:12.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2387
01:54:12.820 --> 01:54:13.301
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2388
01:54:13.301 --> 01:54:17.240
<v Speaker 2>the Internet and all of this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like people are losing touch with</v>

2389
01:54:17.241 --> 01:54:21.410
<v Speaker 2>themselves and with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't validate me.</v>

2394
01:54:29.460 --> 01:54:32.750

2397
01:54:36.680 --> 01:54:38.510

<v Speaker 2>out of mind.</v>

2398
01:54:38.870 --> 01:54:42.660
<v Speaker 2>I just don't have time for people</v>
<v Speaker 2>capable of.</v>

2399
01:54:43.030 --> 01:54:44.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I still have the tendency to do the for</v>
<v Speaker 2>disagreements.</v>

2401
01:54:49.410 --> 01:54:51.350
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do take things personal.</v>

2402
01:54:51.351 --> 01:54:52.890
<v Speaker 2>I will make assumptions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm a work in progress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not healed.</v>

2404
01:54:55.910 --> 01:54:58.160
<v Speaker 2>Just like I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm always going to be an addict.</v>

2405
01:54:58.161 --> 01:55:01.700
<v Speaker 2>There's always that possibility that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to fucking.</v>

2406
01:55:01.880 --> 01:55:06.880
<v Speaker 2>I have to have my coat of armor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I say in my sword of fucking pma</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2411
01:55:21.500 --> 01:55:23.660
<v Speaker 2>or if somebody starts talking shit about</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody else,</v>

<v Speaker 2>why the fuck you telling me I don't</v>

2414
01:55:28.701 --> 01:55:31.670
<v Speaker 2>want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to hear it and I forget</v>

2415
01:55:31.671 --> 01:55:34.250
<v Speaker 2>which philosopher said it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he goes,</v>

2416
01:55:35.360 --> 01:55:40.360
<v Speaker 2>the only true a examination of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when we find fault in others,</v>

2417
01:55:41.781 --> 01:55:44.070
<v Speaker 2>it's really what we're seeing in</v>
<v Speaker 2>ourselves.</v>

2418
01:55:44.610 --> 01:55:48.370
<v Speaker 2>We're pointing out the bad shit and</v>
<v Speaker 2>ourselves for sure constantly for</v>

2419
01:55:48.371 --> 01:55:50.400
<v Speaker 2>finding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2420
01:55:50.401 --> 01:55:54.360
<v Speaker 2>with other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it comes back to that fly mentality,</v>

2421
01:55:54.361 --> 01:55:55.380
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

2422
01:55:55.980 --> 01:55:59.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and try to set the good example and</v>

2423
01:55:59.371 --> 01:56:03.900
<v Speaker 2>that's another thing Paul said examples</v>
<v Speaker 2>better than precept and right now you</v>

2424
01:56:03.901 --> 01:56:07.920
<v Speaker 2>just have a motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of people talking shit instead</v>

2425
01:56:07.921 --> 01:56:11.160
<v Speaker 2>of trying to be the example and try to</v>
<v Speaker 2>live it and do it.</v>

2426
01:56:11.161 --> 01:56:15.750
<v Speaker 2>There are a ton of people out there that</v>
<v Speaker 2>is crushing it and staying positive and</v>

2427
01:56:15.751 --> 01:56:16.860
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2428
01:56:16.861 --> 01:56:19.080
<v Speaker 2>getting off drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting off alcohol,</v>

2429
01:56:19.081 --> 01:56:23.040
<v Speaker 2>like even the people in this program and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't even notice shit that these</v>

2430
01:56:23.041 --> 01:56:25.410
<v Speaker 2>guys have been to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking insane.</v>

2431
01:56:25.411 --> 01:56:30.411
<v Speaker 2>Can you imagine spending 20 years in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking jail cell or going to Pelican</v>

2432
01:56:32.410 --> 01:56:34.650
<v Speaker 2>Bay or going at Pelican Bay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being in the shoe,</v>

2433
01:56:35.130 --> 01:56:38.460
<v Speaker 2>like what the fuck that does to human</v>
<v Speaker 2>beings.</v>

2434
01:56:38.730 --> 01:56:42.390
<v Speaker 2>Like the strength that that takes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm going to tell you,</v>

2435
01:56:42.710 --> 01:56:46.950
<v Speaker 2>and the other reason I got involved is</v>
<v Speaker 2>because my uncle back in the day worked</v>

2436
01:56:46.951 --> 01:56:50.730
<v Speaker 2>at Chino prison in the seventies and</v>
<v Speaker 2>eighties.</v>

2437
01:56:50.970 --> 01:56:53.970
<v Speaker 2>He was like the assistant warden or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something in Chino,</v>

2438
01:56:54.180 --> 01:56:56.370
<v Speaker 2>Chino,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you know the prison system,</v>

2439
01:56:56.371 --> 01:56:59.130
<v Speaker 2>what they call it here in California is</v>
<v Speaker 2>gladiator school,</v>

2440
01:56:59.550 --> 01:57:04.200
<v Speaker 2>but there's a documentary about this guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's a former navy seal and he went</v>

2441
01:57:04.201 --> 01:57:08.820
<v Speaker 2>in there and the documentary's called</v>
<v Speaker 2>salvage lives and he went in there and</v>

2442
01:57:08.821 --> 01:57:11.590
<v Speaker 2>taught these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He put them through like a little buds.</v>

2443
01:57:11.591 --> 01:57:13.500
<v Speaker 2>Dang squirted him with holes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trained them.</v>

2444
01:57:13.501 --> 01:57:16.770
<v Speaker 2>Fucking hot as hell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Taught him every aspect of commercial</v>

2445
01:57:16.771 --> 01:57:21.771
<v Speaker 2>diving and when they got released he got</v>
<v Speaker 2>them jobs on oil rigs and all this</v>

2446
01:57:23.041 --> 01:57:25.650
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making six figures and the guys who were</v>

2447
01:57:25.651 --> 01:57:29.580
<v Speaker 2>working for these oil companies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they said these are the most skilled</v>

2448
01:57:29.610 --> 01:57:34.080
<v Speaker 2>fucking people that we've ever had come</v>
<v Speaker 2>to work for these companies.</v>

2449
01:57:34.680 --> 01:57:39.680
<v Speaker 2>So between trying to be the set a good</v>
<v Speaker 2>example and seeing that people before me</v>

2450
01:57:39.860 --> 01:57:43.650
<v Speaker 2>that's done it and wanting to reach out</v>
<v Speaker 2>and help people have seen and my uncle</v>

2451
01:57:43.651 --> 01:57:47.400
<v Speaker 2>telling me about this guy and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing the documentary when it came on,</v>

2452
01:57:47.880 --> 01:57:51.360
<v Speaker 2>I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gotta try to do something to turn the</v>

2453
01:57:51.361 --> 01:57:55.080
<v Speaker 2>tide and having a platform like Netflix</v>
<v Speaker 2>or whoever is going to pick up this</v>

2454
01:57:55.081 --> 01:57:56.370
<v Speaker 2>documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2455
01:57:57.420 --> 01:58:00.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it could show people listening,</v>

2456
01:58:00.151 --> 01:58:01.920
<v Speaker 2>stopping costs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aerating motherfuckers.</v>

2457
01:58:01.921 --> 01:58:04.650
<v Speaker 2>It's about education,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not incarceration.</v>

2458
01:58:05.010 --> 01:58:07.380
<v Speaker 2>These are not animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are human beings.</v>

2459
01:58:07.650 --> 01:58:09.210
<v Speaker 2>It's a broken system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

2460
01:58:09.211 --> 01:58:09.780
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

2461
01:58:09.780 --> 01:58:12.330
<v Speaker 3>It's not helping anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just making people harder.</v>

2462
01:58:12.331 --> 01:58:15.540
<v Speaker 3>Criminals and it's just punishing them</v>
<v Speaker 3>by keeping them locked in a cage and</v>

2463
01:58:15.780 --> 01:58:18.720
<v Speaker 3>they never get any better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the idea is that you're</v>

2464
01:58:18.930 --> 01:58:22.650
<v Speaker 3>removing the dangerous elements of</v>
<v Speaker 3>society and protecting the rest of us.</v>

2465
01:58:22.720 --> 01:58:23.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get that.</v>

2466
01:58:23.671 --> 01:58:27.300
<v Speaker 3>But there's this idea of rehabilitation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's nonexistent</v>

2467
01:58:27.780 --> 01:58:30.960
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They even removed the exercise equipment</v>

2468
01:58:30.961 --> 01:58:33.870
<v Speaker 2>in the prison because now if you watch</v>
<v Speaker 2>13 years,</v>

2469
01:58:33.871 --> 01:58:34.704
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2470
01:58:35.240 --> 01:58:36.160
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2471
01:58:36.290 --> 01:58:41.290
<v Speaker 2>it's basically like warehousing bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man and violate them.</v>

2472
01:58:41.891 --> 01:58:45.460
<v Speaker 2>One dude got violated for smoking a</v>
<v Speaker 2>cigarette in a facility and they sent</v>

2473
01:58:45.461 --> 01:58:47.740
<v Speaker 2>them back to serve the rest of his</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking sentence.</v>

2474
01:58:47.770 --> 01:58:51.850
<v Speaker 2>There is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And especially out here in California</v>

2475
01:58:51.851 --> 01:58:56.851
<v Speaker 2>like California and Texas and Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man is fucking crazy.</v>

2476
01:58:58.270 --> 01:58:59.150
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2477
01:58:59.210 --> 01:59:00.011

<v Speaker 2>and look,</v>

2478
01:59:00.011 --> 01:59:04.030
<v Speaker 2>I look back to the whole situation that</v>
<v Speaker 2>went down in the eighties because I</v>

2479
01:59:04.031 --> 01:59:07.810
<v Speaker 2>really try to do research and the whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that went down.</v>

<v Speaker 2>just say no.</v>

2481

<v Speaker 2>doing the fondos operations in South</v>

2539
02:02:15.750 --> 02:02:17.980
<v Speaker 2>Then they invested in the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>prisons.</v>

2540
02:02:18.520 --> 02:02:20.890
<v Speaker 2>So they're making money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the crazy thing.</v>

2541
02:02:20.891 --> 02:02:21.910

02:02:23.050 --> 02:02:26.800
<v Speaker 1>the most evil thing that you can make</v>
<v Speaker 1>money and therefore you're incentivized</v>

2543
02:02:26.801 --> 02:02:30.610
<v Speaker 1>to make draw the drug laws are more</v>
<v Speaker 1>strict so you can get more people in</v>

2544
02:02:30.611 --> 02:02:32.200
<v Speaker 1>prison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you generate more income.</v>

2545
02:02:32.240 --> 02:02:34.220
<v Speaker 2>13th man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you ain't seen [inaudible]</v>

2546
02:02:34.390 --> 02:02:37.750
<v Speaker 2>documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I saw that,</v>

2547
02:02:37.770 --> 02:02:42.770
<v Speaker 2>I knew what my calling was to do because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know Noah Levine,</v>

2548
02:02:43.021 --> 02:02:45.450
<v Speaker 2>he wrote this book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dharma punks and he's been a Buddhist.</v>

2549
02:02:45.451 --> 02:02:48.310
<v Speaker 2>He was a heroin addict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He used to do a Buddhist ministry and</v>

2550
02:02:48.311 --> 02:02:53.311
<v Speaker 2>the prisons in and change these people's</v>
<v Speaker 2>lives and you know,</v>

2551
02:02:53.540 --> 02:02:54.091
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

2552
02:02:54.091 --> 02:02:57.570
<v Speaker 2>they came out in his magazine called</v>
<v Speaker 2>Satya and I read this article.</v>

2553
02:02:57.750 --> 02:03:01.200
<v Speaker 2>So Satya in Sanskrit means the motive</v>
<v Speaker 2>goodness.</v>

2554
02:03:01.500 --> 02:03:04.740
<v Speaker 2>So that's what this magazine was called.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I read this article about these</v>

2555
02:03:04.741 --> 02:03:09.210
<v Speaker 2>inmates daddy was working with and one</v>
<v Speaker 2>of them said he was never getting out.</v>

2556
02:03:09.300 --> 02:03:10.670
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2557
02:03:10.920 --> 02:03:14.910
<v Speaker 2>life without the possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said if I had access to the</v>

2558
02:03:14.911 --> 02:03:17.430
<v Speaker 2>information of what I've learned through</v>
<v Speaker 2>this program,</v>

2559
02:03:17.431 --> 02:03:21.240
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't be where I'm at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then that planted the seed in me and</v>

2560
02:03:21.241 --> 02:03:25.470
<v Speaker 2>then just seeing what the whole shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>turned into,</v>

2561
02:03:25.471 --> 02:03:29.520
<v Speaker 2>how the people that really need the food</v>
<v Speaker 2>deserts in everything that's going on in</v>

2562
02:03:29.521 --> 02:03:32.850
<v Speaker 2>this country and the research I've done</v>
<v Speaker 2>and everything I've been talking about</v>

2563
02:03:32.851 --> 02:03:37.800
<v Speaker 2>and fighting for change by taking action</v>
<v Speaker 2>against the fucked up shit.</v>

2564
02:03:38.010 --> 02:03:41.940
<v Speaker 2>And then 13th coming out and just lit</v>
<v Speaker 2>another fire under me.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I think no one should be president.</v>

2619
02:05:58.290 --> 02:06:02.460
<v Speaker 3>And I think the idea of having a</v>
<v Speaker 3>popularity contest fucking ridiculous.</v>

2620
02:06:02.490 --> 02:06:03.540
<v Speaker 3>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2621
02:06:03.541 --> 02:06:07.750
<v Speaker 3>we should have as a council of wise</v>
<v Speaker 3>people and they should have school,</v>

2622
02:06:08.150 --> 02:06:13.080
<v Speaker 3>the real shit be a group of the most</v>
<v Speaker 3>wise a codified yes,</v>

2623
02:06:13.380 --> 02:06:15.020
<v Speaker 3>but I mean you should.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your.</v>

2624
02:06:15.030 --> 02:06:17.970
<v Speaker 3>Your work should be judged like it</v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't be partisan.</v>

2625
02:06:17.971 --> 02:06:21.390
<v Speaker 3>It shouldn't be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're trying to appeal to social</v>

2626
02:06:21.391 --> 02:06:25.540
<v Speaker 3>justice warriors are radical</v>
<v Speaker 3>progressives or radical conservatives or</v>

2627
02:06:25.860 --> 02:06:30.240
<v Speaker 3>right wing Christian fundamentalists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It should be you're making sense because</v>

2628
02:06:30.241 --> 02:06:34.320
<v Speaker 3>you understand law and fairness and</v>
<v Speaker 3>ethics and morals and values and you</v>

2629
02:06:34.321 --> 02:06:38.910
<v Speaker 3>understand like with an objective sense</v>
<v Speaker 3>and an educated sense of how to</v>

2630
02:06:38.911 --> 02:06:43.170
<v Speaker 3>establish a quality community of human</v>
<v Speaker 3>beings,</v>

2631
02:06:43.260 --> 02:06:48.260
<v Speaker 3>civilization in which people can prosper</v>
<v Speaker 3>in which laws are fair and in which we</v>

2632
02:06:48.810 --> 02:06:51.810
<v Speaker 3>we established what are what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

2633
02:06:51.820 --> 02:06:55.110
<v Speaker 3>what do we find necessary?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do we find important?</v>

2634
02:06:55.111 --> 02:06:57.510
<v Speaker 3>What's imperative?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Education,</v>

2635
02:06:57.870 --> 02:07:00.720
<v Speaker 3>community,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these different values and enforce</v>

2636
02:07:00.721 --> 02:07:05.610
<v Speaker 3>those in it somehow or another,</v>
<v Speaker 3>figure out a way to make this world a</v>

2637
02:07:05.611 --> 02:07:09.270
<v Speaker 3>better place than what it is now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Engineer a better place.</v>

2638
02:07:09.360 --> 02:07:12.750
<v Speaker 3>That's not what we get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you get is some person who says</v>

2639
02:07:12.751 --> 02:07:15.180
<v Speaker 3>they're going to do all kinds of shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>until they get in there and they very</v>

2640
02:07:15.181 --> 02:07:15.860
<v Speaker 3>rarely do.</v>

2641
02:07:15.860 --> 02:07:19.640
<v Speaker 4>Did you see the Ab shit that they just</v>
<v Speaker 4>put up for all of fucking trump,</v>

2642
02:07:19.641 --> 02:07:23.300
<v Speaker 4>like the shitty promise on the campaign</v>
<v Speaker 4>and now we're actually doing.</v>

2643
02:07:23.310 --> 02:07:24.770
<v Speaker 4>It's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one's done any different,</v>

2644
02:07:24.771 --> 02:07:27.350
<v Speaker 4>but Obama did the same shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bama did the same shit.</v>

2645
02:07:27.780 --> 02:07:29.570
<v Speaker 4>They get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Listen,</v>

2646
02:07:29.660 --> 02:07:31.310
<v Speaker 4>Hillary would've done the same shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They all,</v>

2647
02:07:31.340 --> 02:07:32.680
<v Speaker 4>they all do the same shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

2648
02:07:32.700 --> 02:07:37.120
<v Speaker 4>and the thing that fucked me up the most</v>
<v Speaker 4>is the vote doesn't decide who the fuck</v>

2649
02:07:37.121 --> 02:07:40.300
<v Speaker 4>gets in tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking the electoral college is.</v>

2650
02:07:40.301 --> 02:07:43.450
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck is that shit?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who is that?</v>

2651
02:07:43.451 --> 02:07:44.790
<v Speaker 4>Who the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wonderful.</v>

2652
02:07:45.330 --> 02:07:49.140
<v Speaker 3>The government was a great idea when you</v>
<v Speaker 3>had to get on a fucking horse and take</v>

2653
02:07:49.141 --> 02:07:51.570
<v Speaker 3>your ass to Washington in order to place</v>
<v Speaker 3>your votes.</v>

2654
02:07:51.750 --> 02:07:54.570
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to do that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could vote instantaneously.</v>

2655
02:07:54.690 --> 02:07:57.240
<v Speaker 3>People should be able to vote on issues</v>
<v Speaker 3>with their phone.</v>

2656
02:07:57.390 --> 02:07:58.860
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your phone's in your pocket all the</v>

2657
02:07:58.861 --> 02:07:59.910
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should be able to.</v>

2658
02:08:00.330 --> 02:08:01.770
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should have some sort of</v>

2659
02:08:01.800 --> 02:08:05.040
<v Speaker 3>understanding what you're voting on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should have to pass some sort of</v>

2660
02:08:05.070 --> 02:08:06.270
<v Speaker 3>test.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They should say,</v>

2661
02:08:06.271 --> 02:08:07.890
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you want to vote about,</v>

2662
02:08:08.030 --> 02:08:10.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you want to vote on spending?</v>

2663
02:08:10.261 --> 02:08:13.230
<v Speaker 3>Do you want to vote on healthcare?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much do you understand about</v>

2664
02:08:13.320 --> 02:08:14.100
<v Speaker 3>healthcare?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2665
02:08:14.100 --> 02:08:17.310
<v Speaker 3>let's take a test and the people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>can pass the test,</v>

2666
02:08:17.400 --> 02:08:20.070
<v Speaker 3>understanding what the consequences are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why they're doing this,</v>

2667
02:08:20.340 --> 02:08:24.240
<v Speaker 3>then you should be able to vote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this should be something that you</v>

2668
02:08:24.400 --> 02:08:25.890
<v Speaker 3>should have some skin in the game.</v>

2669
02:08:26.100 --> 02:08:30.240
<v Speaker 3>There should be some understanding of</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the system is.</v>

2670
02:08:30.360 --> 02:08:32.070
<v Speaker 3>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2671
02:08:32.160 --> 02:08:34.770
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a giant supporter of any</v>

2672
02:08:34.771 --> 02:08:37.800
<v Speaker 3>mainstream media,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's a right wing or left wing,</v>

2673
02:08:37.801 --> 02:08:41.940
<v Speaker 3>but there's something fucked up about</v>
<v Speaker 3>these people from CNN go to these trump</v>

2674
02:08:41.941 --> 02:08:45.300
<v Speaker 3>rallies and you got hundreds of people</v>
<v Speaker 3>giving them the finger.</v>

2675
02:08:45.301 --> 02:08:47.160
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're fake news.</v>

2676
02:08:47.170 --> 02:08:49.530
<v Speaker 3>Fucking they got an American flag tee</v>
<v Speaker 3>shirts on.</v>

2677
02:08:49.900 --> 02:08:50.733
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2678
02:08:50.760 --> 02:08:51.740

2679
02:08:51.741 --> 02:08:55.110
<v Speaker 3>a nonsense almost pro wrestling aspect</v>
<v Speaker 3>to all this.</v>

2680
02:08:55.111 --> 02:08:58.170
<v Speaker 3>What has become it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's profiting off this.</v>

2681
02:08:58.200 --> 02:09:00.330
<v Speaker 3>Trump is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is for his,</v>

2682
02:09:00.331 --> 02:09:01.350
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his advantage.</v>

2683
02:09:01.351 --> 02:09:05.160
<v Speaker 3>He set this up because he found a broken</v>
<v Speaker 3>system and he said,</v>

2684
02:09:05.190 --> 02:09:07.170
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just fucking rigged the system.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I know how to get people to like me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been doing this forever.</v>

2686
02:09:09.690 --> 02:09:12.090
<v Speaker 3>I'm a cocky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>arrogant billionaire.</v>

02:10:57.051 --> 02:11:00.290
<v Speaker 1>She's been full of shit forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you watched the conversation between</v>

2724
02:11:00.291 --> 02:11:04.490
<v Speaker 1>James Komi when James Comey testified</v>
<v Speaker 1>about what he did and what they found</v>

2725
02:11:04.491 --> 02:11:07.400
<v Speaker 1>with the Hillary Clinton emails and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>her version of it,</v>

2726
02:11:07.640 --> 02:11:12.640

02:11:14.300 --> 02:11:15.150
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2729
02:11:15.260 --> 02:11:18.080
<v Speaker 1>even worse than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they rig the DNC,</v>

2730
02:11:18.290 --> 02:11:21.080
<v Speaker 1>they've rigged the primary so that</v>

<v Speaker 1>foster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2776
02:13:31.171 --> 02:13:32.070
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

2777
02:13:32.280 --> 02:13:35.010
<v Speaker 1>They found the gun in his hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you never do when you kill</v>

2778
02:13:35.011 --> 02:13:36.690
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you shoot yourself,</v>

2779
02:13:36.870 --> 02:13:38.840
<v Speaker 1>when you shoot yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he pulled that trigger blam.</v>

2780
02:13:39.120 --> 02:13:41.130
<v Speaker 1>Everything goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gun goes flying.</v>

2781
02:13:41.280 --> 02:13:44.530
<v Speaker 1>You don't hold onto it is recoiling the</v>
<v Speaker 1>gun like you know,</v>

2782
02:13:44.870 --> 02:13:46.950
<v Speaker 1>and you blow your brains out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not holding your gun anymore.</v>

2783
02:13:46.951 --> 02:13:47.784
<v Speaker 1>It goes flying.</v>

2784
02:13:47.910 --> 02:13:51.060
<v Speaker 1>And he was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had the gun in his hand and the blood</v>

2785
02:13:51.061 --> 02:13:53.790
<v Speaker 1>that was missing from his body was not</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the scene of the crime.</v>

2786
02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:57.330
<v Speaker 1>So the researchers think that they moved</v>
<v Speaker 1>his body.</v>

2787
02:13:57.690 --> 02:13:59.960
<v Speaker 1>He was dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They put them there and make the crime</v>

2788
02:13:59.961 --> 02:14:01.480
<v Speaker 1>scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They put a gun in his hands up,</v>

2789
02:14:01.530 --> 02:14:04.470
<v Speaker 1>case closed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what was he testified he was going</v>

2790
02:14:04.471 --> 02:14:06.810
<v Speaker 1>and fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he knew he had information about</v>

2791
02:14:06.811 --> 02:14:08.130
<v Speaker 1>Whitewater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2792
02:14:08.160 --> 02:14:10.560
<v Speaker 1>what he was going to say and who knows</v>
<v Speaker 1>they killed them.</v>

2793
02:14:10.600 --> 02:14:12.600
<v Speaker 1>We'll never find out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about the guy that,</v>

2794
02:14:12.601 --> 02:14:15.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was one of the whistleblowers for Enron,</v>

2795
02:14:15.270 --> 02:14:20.270
<v Speaker 1>shot himself in the head twice and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>threw that shit sylaria shoot yourself</v>

2796
02:14:21.211 --> 02:14:21.930
<v Speaker 1>in the head twice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luck.</v>

2797
02:14:21.930 --> 02:14:24.780
<v Speaker 1>Case closed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's clearly a suicide.</v>

2798
02:14:24.810 --> 02:14:27.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess you could kind of graze your</v>

2799
02:14:27.001 --> 02:14:29.430
<v Speaker 1>head if you pussied out like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah.</v>

2800
02:14:29.610 --> 02:14:30.361
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

2801
02:14:30.361 --> 02:14:30.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm bleeding.</v>

2802
02:14:30.870 --> 02:14:34.080
<v Speaker 1>I could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is possible,</v>

2803
02:14:34.230 --> 02:14:38.280
<v Speaker 1>but it's more likely somebody killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People kill people.</v>

2804
02:14:38.281 --> 02:14:41.940
<v Speaker 1>It's part of the thing when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>involved with billion dollar deals with</v>

2805
02:14:41.941 --> 02:14:45.600
<v Speaker 1>giant corporations and they also tied</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the military industrial complex,</v>

2806
02:14:45.780 --> 02:14:49.110
<v Speaker 1>who by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kill innocents all the time and write it</v>

2807
02:14:49.111 --> 02:14:51.570
<v Speaker 1>off like all this shit that happened</v>
<v Speaker 1>with drones.</v>

<v Speaker 1>drones.</v>

2810
02:14:56.400 --> 02:14:58.560
<v Speaker 1>They don't worry about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think they're going to worry about</v>

2811
02:14:58.561 --> 02:15:00.660
<v Speaker 1>some guy's gonna sink,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Monsanto,</v>

<v Speaker 1>most of the glyphosate that's being put</v>

2820

<v Speaker 1>he lived near a golf course and they put</v>

2824
02:15:37.981 --> 02:15:41.640
<v Speaker 1>so many pesticides in the golf course</v>
<v Speaker 1>that had got into the groundwater.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it with this metal pipe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>The problem is they're hiding in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>jungle.</v>

2840
02:16:22.200 --> 02:16:25.260
<v Speaker 1>We got to get rid of the jungle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just killed the jungle with poison,</v>

2841
02:16:25.510 --> 02:16:29.800
<v Speaker 1>with this crazy thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just sprayed chemicals all over the</v>

2842
02:16:29.801 --> 02:16:30.280
<v Speaker 1>jungle</v>

2843
02:16:30.280 --> 02:16:32.950
<v Speaker 3>to kill the fucking forest so they could</v>
<v Speaker 3>see where the enemy are hardened.</v>

2844
02:16:33.650 --> 02:16:36.100
<v Speaker 3>And then they had the troops walking</v>
<v Speaker 3>through those chemicals.</v>

2845
02:16:36.101 --> 02:16:37.930
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

2846
02:16:39.040 --> 02:16:42.790
<v Speaker 3>History will not judge them kindly when</v>
<v Speaker 3>they step back and think about what they</v>

2847
02:16:42.791 --> 02:16:47.791
<v Speaker 3>actually did mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's in the 19 sixties were our parents</v>

2848
02:16:48.611 --> 02:16:52.630
<v Speaker 3>generation and the way we look at it as</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost like this unfortunate thing that</v>

2849
02:16:52.631 --> 02:16:54.970
<v Speaker 3>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I almost think we're too close to it</v>

2850
02:16:55.180 --> 02:16:59.770
<v Speaker 3>to recognize how horrific it is that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>soldiers who were putting their lives on</v>

2851
02:16:59.771 --> 02:17:03.580
<v Speaker 3>the line in their thought to defend our</v>
<v Speaker 3>freedom over in America,</v>

2852
02:17:03.730 --> 02:17:06.600
<v Speaker 3>we're getting poisoned by their own</v>
<v Speaker 3>government.</v>

2853
02:17:06.610 --> 02:17:06.700

<v Speaker 3>in the eye and then there's the</v>
<v Speaker 3>justification after the act.</v>

2892

<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Hussein there out of there anyway.</v>

2894
02:18:57.700 --> 02:18:58.630
<v Speaker 3>He was a bad guy,</v>

2895
02:18:58.880 --> 02:19:02.830
<v Speaker 2>but you haven't worked with him in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>early eighties and gave him the fucking</v>

<v Speaker 2>gas that he used.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what the fuck is like?</v>

<v Speaker 3>well it was,</v>

2900
02:19:12.440 --> 02:19:14.990
<v Speaker 3>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They took advantage of an opportunity.</v>

2901
02:19:14.991 --> 02:19:16.280
<v Speaker 3>We got attacked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2902
02:19:16.281 --> 02:19:19.790
<v Speaker 3>September 11th.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The planes get hit by the towers,</v>

02:19:19.791 --> 02:19:22.520
<v Speaker 3>got hit by the planes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody wanted to action and this was</v>

2904
02:19:22.521 --> 02:19:26.420
<v Speaker 3>an opportunity for them to take</v>
<v Speaker 3>advantage of this call for action.</v>

2905
02:19:26.750 --> 02:19:30.920
<v Speaker 3>And though we're going against someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>that had nothing to do with the attacks</v>

2906
02:19:30.921 --> 02:19:33.410
<v Speaker 3>on September 11th,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people felt like something was</v>

2907
02:19:33.411 --> 02:19:33.990
<v Speaker 3>happening.</v>

2908
02:19:33.990 --> 02:19:35.700
<v Speaker 2>The head guy from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>

2909
02:19:35.730 --> 02:19:38.780
<v Speaker 2>from a department of defense was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2910
02:19:38.790 --> 02:19:41.220
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean they're fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotta see this movie.</v>

2911
02:19:41.221 --> 02:19:42.930
<v Speaker 2>It's all fact based too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2912
02:19:42.931 --> 02:19:45.840
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean we're going in Iraq?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Didn't have anything to do with it.</v>

2913
02:19:45.841 --> 02:19:47.400
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck are we going into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>IRA?</v>

2914
02:19:47.580 --> 02:19:48.413
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well he,</v>

2915
02:19:48.680 --> 02:19:51.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they tried to say he led a</v>

2916
02:19:51.241 --> 02:19:56.241
<v Speaker 2>Osama bin Ladin if the NSF,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if Osama bin Ladin met Saddam was saying</v>

2917
02:19:57.561 --> 02:19:59.730
<v Speaker 2>face to face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would tell them to go fuck himself.</v>

2918
02:19:59.790 --> 02:20:03.600
<v Speaker 2>That's how different ideologies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those two hats.</v>

2919
02:20:03.740 --> 02:20:05.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sama Bin Ladin was religious.</v>

2920
02:20:06.500 --> 02:20:07.333
<v Speaker 3>He's.</v>

2921
02:20:09.020 --> 02:20:10.330
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2922
02:20:11.810 --> 02:20:13.250
<v Speaker 2>they just sold it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They kept.</v>

2923
02:20:13.490 --> 02:20:18.490
<v Speaker 2>But what's great about the movie is it</v>
<v Speaker 2>shows how they just started force</v>

2924
02:20:18.681 --> 02:20:23.030
<v Speaker 2>feeding the information out there to</v>
<v Speaker 2>create this fucking feverish,</v>

2925
02:20:23.031 --> 02:20:23.930
<v Speaker 2>kill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kill,</v>

2926
02:20:23.931 --> 02:20:26.930
<v Speaker 2>kill fucking mentality that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Americans.</v>

2927
02:20:27.340 --> 02:20:28.990
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same thing.</v>

2928
02:20:28.991 --> 02:20:31.750
<v Speaker 3>You're seeing what these people</v>
<v Speaker 3>screaming at Jim Acosta and you can</v>

2929
02:20:31.751 --> 02:20:34.960
<v Speaker 3>manipulate dummies mindsets and this is</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they do.</v>

2930
02:20:34.990 --> 02:20:38.920
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is an easy way to pull the</v>
<v Speaker 3>strings of the most easily lead.</v>

2931
02:20:39.100 --> 02:20:42.310
<v Speaker 3>You got to think who's going to these</v>
<v Speaker 3>rallies in the first place?</v>

2932
02:20:42.340 --> 02:20:45.610
<v Speaker 3>Most of these people that are going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>these trump rallies or something like</v>

2933
02:20:45.611 --> 02:20:47.020

<v Speaker 3>they're morons.</v>

<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

2935
02:20:48.521 --> 02:20:51.010
<v Speaker 3>They don't have shit to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if you're a trump supporter,</v>

2936
02:20:51.400 --> 02:20:53.320

<v Speaker 3>supporter,</v>

<v Speaker 2>and then they were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's inciting a lot of this shit going</v>

2960
02:21:58.920 --> 02:22:00.030
<v Speaker 2>rabble rouser.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2961
02:22:00.060 --> 02:22:01.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's part of being an asshole.</v>

2962
02:22:01.790 --> 02:22:03.970
<v Speaker 2>Divide and conquer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>divide and conquer.</v>

2963
02:22:03.971 --> 02:22:07.990
<v Speaker 2>If they could keep the people fighting</v>
<v Speaker 2>each other over stupid shit,</v>

2964
02:22:08.230 --> 02:22:10.570
<v Speaker 2>then you're not going to take the time</v>
<v Speaker 2>to sit back.</v>

2965
02:22:11.020 --> 02:22:12.800
<v Speaker 2>I compare those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2966
02:22:12.850 --> 02:22:14.220
<v Speaker 2>what's really going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2967
02:22:14.221 --> 02:22:16.810
<v Speaker 2>I use the analogy of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a magician.</v>

2968
02:22:17.200 --> 02:22:19.390
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look what's in the left hand,</v>

2969
02:22:19.391 --> 02:22:21.820
<v Speaker 2>but what the real shit is in the right</v>
<v Speaker 2>hand.</v>

2970
02:22:22.030 --> 02:22:25.060
<v Speaker 2>So by doing all this shit and causing</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these problems,</v>

2971
02:22:25.230 --> 02:22:28.770
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to go back and look at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the shit that he's pushing through his</v>

2972
02:22:28.771 --> 02:22:32.540
<v Speaker 2>agendas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just cut taxes to the fucking</v>

2973
02:22:32.590 --> 02:22:35.400
<v Speaker 2>enriches people that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2974
02:22:35.540 --> 02:22:38.880
<v Speaker 2>the billionaires and cooperation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which he said he wasn't going to do.</v>

2975
02:22:39.120 --> 02:22:42.330
<v Speaker 2>He's gone back on everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if he could just get people,</v>

2976
02:22:42.331 --> 02:22:46.290
<v Speaker 2>fuck you and fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And getting people to hate each other</v>

2977
02:22:46.291 --> 02:22:50.100
<v Speaker 2>and keep this country is to United</v>
<v Speaker 2>States of America.</v>

2978
02:22:50.101 --> 02:22:54.750
<v Speaker 2>When the fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did we become united as a country</v>

2979
02:22:55.140 --> 02:23:00.140
<v Speaker 2>like I think a lot of these countries</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now who may pose a threat or</v>

2980
02:23:00.331 --> 02:23:02.700
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're seeing what the fuck's going on</v>

2981
02:23:02.940 --> 02:23:03.960
<v Speaker 2>and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yo,</v>

2982
02:23:03.990 --> 02:23:06.600
<v Speaker 2>this country has never been more fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>divided.</v>

2983
02:23:06.630 --> 02:23:11.190
<v Speaker 2>It's divided states of America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the United States of America.</v>

2984
02:23:11.400 --> 02:23:12.900
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what he's doing with these,</v>

2985
02:23:12.990 --> 02:23:17.370
<v Speaker 3>these rallies is he's getting people</v>
<v Speaker 3>excited about being a part of a team and</v>

2986
02:23:17.371 --> 02:23:18.780
<v Speaker 3>a team that's winning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2987
02:23:18.781 --> 02:23:21.960
<v Speaker 3>like where the team is kicking ass and</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is team fake news over there.</v>

2988
02:23:21.961 --> 02:23:24.310
<v Speaker 3>You tell them to go fuck themselves and</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody gets Ya,</v>

2989
02:23:24.311 --> 02:23:24.900
<v Speaker 3>Ya,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ya.</v>

2990
02:23:24.900 --> 02:23:29.040
<v Speaker 3>He's consolidating his support.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He and it doesn't have to make sense and</v>

2991
02:23:29.041 --> 02:23:31.440
<v Speaker 3>especially it doesn't have to make sense</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the people that are going to these</v>

2992
02:23:31.441 --> 02:23:33.750
<v Speaker 3>rallies because they're not smart people</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the first place.</v>

2993
02:23:33.990 --> 02:23:36.870
<v Speaker 3>There are people that are easily led,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's the same thing with people</v>

2994
02:23:36.871 --> 02:23:38.500
<v Speaker 3>that would go to the rallies for Hillary</v>
<v Speaker 3>Clinton.</v>

2995
02:23:38.501 --> 02:23:40.560
<v Speaker 3>There are people that go to the rallies</v>
<v Speaker 3>for almost all these people.</v>

2996
02:23:40.710 --> 02:23:44.490
<v Speaker 3>A giant chunk of them are just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just lemmings.</v>

2997
02:23:44.610 --> 02:23:45.690
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what to do.</v>

2998
02:23:45.870 --> 02:23:50.870
<v Speaker 2>I do have to hit one thing and that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>when fuck it and Hillary Clinton Clinton</v>

<v Speaker 2>I was laughing at those people when she</v>

<v Speaker 2>through America and people may be</v>

3009
02:24:32.971 --> 02:24:37.520
<v Speaker 2>progressive on the outskirts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but go into the middle.</v>

02:24:46.051 --> 02:24:47.310
<v Speaker 3>she was corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3014
02:24:47.311 --> 02:24:49.260
<v Speaker 3>you did a good job of calling her</v>
<v Speaker 3>corrupt</v>

3015
02:24:49.280 --> 02:24:50.620
<v Speaker 2>Hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

3016
02:24:50.621 --> 02:24:51.540
<v Speaker 2>The.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just kept.</v>

3017
02:24:51.760 --> 02:24:56.150
<v Speaker 2>The mantra was going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he loves mantras and he pushes those</v>

3018
02:24:56.151 --> 02:24:57.950
<v Speaker 2>fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they just had.</v>

3019
02:24:58.000 --> 02:24:58.833
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3020
02:24:59.210 --> 02:25:01.190
<v Speaker 2>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Tracy,</v>

3021
02:25:01.191 --> 02:25:03.960
<v Speaker 2>Bernie crazy burn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's</v>

3022
02:25:03.970 --> 02:25:04.600
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a,</v>

3023
02:25:04.600 --> 02:25:08.710
<v Speaker 3>he's a good manipulator in that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she knows she didn't do any</v>

3024
02:25:08.711 --> 02:25:10.810
<v Speaker 3>services,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there was also like a lot of the</v>

3025
02:25:10.811 --> 02:25:15.250
<v Speaker 3>women that were really upset where like</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy was in that video saying you</v>

3026
02:25:15.260 --> 02:25:17.470
<v Speaker 3>take girls and grab them by the Pussy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so they,</v>

3027
02:25:17.860 --> 02:25:22.180
<v Speaker 3>they felt like this was going to give</v>
<v Speaker 3>men a licensed to be sexually abusive.</v>

3028
02:25:22.210 --> 02:25:27.210
<v Speaker 3>And I think that in a of ways is what</v>
<v Speaker 3>started the ball rolling with the me too</v>

3029
02:25:27.491 --> 02:25:30.970
<v Speaker 3>movement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't just the exposing of monsters</v>

3030
02:25:30.971 --> 02:25:34.450
<v Speaker 3>like Bill Cosby,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was also the fact that you're</v>

3031
02:25:34.451 --> 02:25:37.660
<v Speaker 3>dealing with this guy who gets in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>White House.</v>

3032
02:25:37.661 --> 02:25:40.210
<v Speaker 3>That's clearly not what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want.</v>

3033
02:25:40.570 --> 02:25:43.360
<v Speaker 3>If it's a man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want a man who respects women,</v>

3034
02:25:43.361 --> 02:25:48.340
<v Speaker 3>who's a statesman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's a person who has worked their life</v>

3035
02:25:48.341 --> 02:25:50.650
<v Speaker 3>to get to that position.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not a person who did it as an</v>

3036
02:25:50.651 --> 02:25:52.300
<v Speaker 3>afterthought once they were already</v>
<v Speaker 3>famous.</v>

3037
02:25:52.890 --> 02:25:54.250
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the difference between a guy like</v>

3038
02:25:54.251 --> 02:25:56.140
<v Speaker 3>Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Obama's probably.</v>

3039
02:25:56.440 --> 02:26:00.040
<v Speaker 3>He's probably measured his words ever</v>
<v Speaker 3>since he was in college because he was</v>

3040
02:26:00.041 --> 02:26:03.670
<v Speaker 3>hoping one day he would be president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas a guy like donald trump's just</v>

3041
02:26:03.671 --> 02:26:08.590
<v Speaker 3>been banging hoes and fucking flight</v>
<v Speaker 3>around the jet with his name on it since</v>

3042
02:26:08.591 --> 02:26:11.050
<v Speaker 3>the eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is what the guy did.</v>

3043
02:26:11.051 --> 02:26:13.350
<v Speaker 3>So then once he's in office,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people like,</v>

3044
02:26:13.560 --> 02:26:16.720
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't believe like how could this</v>

3045
02:26:16.721 --> 02:26:19.000
<v Speaker 3>have happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the pussy grabber.</v>

3046
02:26:19.001 --> 02:26:22.390
<v Speaker 3>He's not supposed to be in there and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>get their pain.</v>

3047
02:26:22.391 --> 02:26:24.490
<v Speaker 3>I understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is also funny.</v>

3048
02:26:24.820 --> 02:26:27.820
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but something like the women's on her</v>

3049
02:26:27.821 --> 02:26:29.730
<v Speaker 3>knees with the glasses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You ever seen a check with the</v>

3050
02:26:30.460 --> 02:26:31.930
<v Speaker 3>screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>

3051
02:26:32.200 --> 02:26:34.270
<v Speaker 3>she's a meme.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She will.</v>

3052
02:26:34.480 --> 02:26:36.420
<v Speaker 3>She will again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They made a,</v>

3053
02:26:39.220 --> 02:26:43.600
<v Speaker 3>they call it trump derangement syndrome</v>
<v Speaker 3>now because people are literally,</v>

3054
02:26:43.601 --> 02:26:47.200
<v Speaker 3>they're so angry that he is in power and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing they can do about it,</v>

3055
02:26:47.201 --> 02:26:52.201
<v Speaker 3>but the problem is that anger and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>that going derange that that empowers</v>

3056
02:26:54.071 --> 02:26:55.090
<v Speaker 3>the people that support him.</v>

3057
02:26:55.090 --> 02:26:57.610
<v Speaker 3>They don't understand when you're on</v>
<v Speaker 3>your knees screaming,</v>

3058
02:26:57.760 --> 02:27:02.240
<v Speaker 3>fuck the people on the other side of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump supporters,</v>

3059
02:27:02.280 --> 02:27:04.740
<v Speaker 3>their fucking red hats on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They think that's hilarious.</v>

3060
02:27:05.670 --> 02:27:07.930
<v Speaker 3>This is the liberal left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unhinged,</v>

3061
02:27:08.080 --> 02:27:10.060
<v Speaker 3>detached from reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile,</v>

3062
02:27:10.061 --> 02:27:13.570
<v Speaker 3>we're making America great again and</v>
<v Speaker 3>black unemployment is at an all time low</v>

3063
02:27:13.810 --> 02:27:14.670
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3064
02:27:14.680 --> 02:27:18.880
<v Speaker 3>it's a weird time for the truth because</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so many people that don't want</v>

3065
02:27:18.890 --> 02:27:23.890
<v Speaker 3>to go any further past the surface that</v>
<v Speaker 3>the truth is this guy figured out a way</v>

3066
02:27:25.240 --> 02:27:28.420
<v Speaker 3>to win a rigged system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did.</v>

3067
02:27:28.450 --> 02:27:29.420
<v Speaker 3>He figured out a way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3068
02:27:29.421 --> 02:27:33.670
<v Speaker 3>when a rig system by pretending to be a</v>
<v Speaker 3>republican guy was a democrat his whole</v>

3069
02:27:33.671 --> 02:27:36.070
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>democratic supporters his whole life</v>

3070
02:27:36.370 --> 02:27:37.350
<v Speaker 3>figured out a way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>just puck a,</v>

<v Speaker 3>these rallies and one,</v>

3079

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and want a system that really shouldn't</v>

02:27:56.291 --> 02:28:00.220
<v Speaker 3>be there to win.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that we need a better way to</v>

3081
02:28:00.221 --> 02:28:03.820
<v Speaker 3>run our government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the idea is fucking genius.</v>

3082
02:28:03.880 --> 02:28:07.660
<v Speaker 3>Having an Alpha male or Alpha female,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that one person,</v>

<v Speaker 3>the one at the top of the peak running</v>
<v Speaker 3>$300,</v>

3084
02:28:10.941 --> 02:28:14.860
<v Speaker 3>million people's insane 300 people's</v>
<v Speaker 3>insane.</v>

3085
02:28:15.230 --> 02:28:17.640
<v Speaker 3>You have 300 people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one person running shit.</v>

3086
02:28:17.650 --> 02:28:19.690
<v Speaker 3>You're going to have disagreements.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to have people that are</v>

3087
02:28:19.691 --> 02:28:23.270
<v Speaker 3>upset that this one person gets to</v>
<v Speaker 3>dictate for the next four to eight</v>

3088
02:28:23.271 --> 02:28:25.700
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The path of everyone in this group and</v>

3089
02:28:25.940 --> 02:28:28.260
<v Speaker 3>your financial future,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your health care,</v>

3090
02:28:28.261 --> 02:28:30.680
<v Speaker 3>your.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're all these how much taxes you pay,</v>

3091
02:28:30.830 --> 02:28:34.280
<v Speaker 3>all depending on what dipshit winds the</v>
<v Speaker 3>popularity contest.</v>

3092
02:28:34.280 --> 02:28:38.000
<v Speaker 3>That's outrageous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an archaic way of handling things.</v>

3093
02:28:38.270 --> 02:28:41.630
<v Speaker 3>It's just not necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the problem with letting everybody</v>

3094
02:28:41.631 --> 02:28:45.320
<v Speaker 3>vote too is that people are really</v>
<v Speaker 3>easily manipulated and they're really</v>

3095
02:28:45.321 --> 02:28:48.710
<v Speaker 3>undereducated people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't have any incentive to pay</v>

3096
02:28:48.711 --> 02:28:52.820
<v Speaker 3>attention to the real issues and what's</v>
<v Speaker 3>at stake and what the consequences of</v>

3097
02:28:52.821 --> 02:28:56.210
<v Speaker 3>each vote are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just vote with whatever feels good</v>

3098
02:28:56.390 --> 02:28:59.860
<v Speaker 3>and they're busy and people are tired</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're eating shitty food and</v>

3099
02:29:00.020 --> 02:29:03.340
<v Speaker 3>exercise and they're working all day in</v>
<v Speaker 3>a job that sucks and they come home,</v>

3100
02:29:03.360 --> 02:29:04.970
<v Speaker 3>their wives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bitch Adam and they're on</v>

3101
02:29:04.971 --> 02:29:08.950
<v Speaker 3>antidepressants and pills and there the</v>
<v Speaker 3>kids are all fucked up and they don't</v>

3102
02:29:08.960 --> 02:29:11.240
<v Speaker 3>have the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't have the time and they don't</v>

3103
02:29:11.241 --> 02:29:15.300
<v Speaker 3>have the incentive to be enlightened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't have the incentive to have an</v>

3104
02:29:15.301 --> 02:29:20.301
<v Speaker 3>objective in lightened approach to how</v>
<v Speaker 3>you handle the future of our society and</v>

3105
02:29:21.141 --> 02:29:22.670
<v Speaker 3>what our children are going to be left</v>
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>

3106
02:29:22.820 --> 02:29:25.280
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's why it's the genius of these</v>

3107
02:29:25.610 --> 02:29:28.350
<v Speaker 4>commercials if you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's.</v>

3108
02:29:28.480 --> 02:29:31.400
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't even watch TV when it's election</v>

3109
02:29:31.401 --> 02:29:35.600
<v Speaker 4>time because it's just like one dude</v>
<v Speaker 4>after the next shitting on each other or</v>

3110
02:29:35.601 --> 02:29:38.780
<v Speaker 4>this person saying that we should mark</v>
<v Speaker 4>them for you.</v>

3111
02:29:38.980 --> 02:29:42.380
<v Speaker 4>It's like the two things that you get</v>
<v Speaker 4>when that shit goes on.</v>

3112
02:29:42.410 --> 02:29:45.950
<v Speaker 4>One of those political commercials in</v>
<v Speaker 4>into was all the commercials for the</v>

3113
02:29:45.951 --> 02:29:49.370
<v Speaker 4>pharmaceuticals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's every fucking night.</v>

3114
02:29:49.460 --> 02:29:51.950
<v Speaker 4>There's two countries on earth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>New Zealand,</v>

3115
02:29:51.980 --> 02:29:54.290
<v Speaker 4>New Zealand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and America is where you're allowed to</v>

3116
02:29:54.291 --> 02:29:58.210
<v Speaker 4>direct advertising to customers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to patients.</v>

3117
02:29:58.211 --> 02:30:01.330
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck is that race?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that crazy?</v>

3118
02:30:01.331 --> 02:30:04.250
<v Speaker 4>And I love the commercials now where the</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude figures it out.</v>

3119
02:30:04.290 --> 02:30:08.350
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you asked about Warfarin and I'd be</v>

3120
02:30:08.360 --> 02:30:12.590
<v Speaker 4>happy because people were walking down</v>
<v Speaker 4>the street and you see cartoon flowers</v>

<v Speaker 4>around them and butterflies and now if</v>
<v Speaker 4>your antidepressants is not working,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Donald Rumsfeld had something to do with</v>

3171
02:32:30.781 --> 02:32:31.610
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Own Stat.</v>

3173
02:32:33.690 --> 02:32:35.340
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had something to do with ignoring</v>

3174
02:32:35.341 --> 02:32:36.410
<v Speaker 4>evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but see,</v>

3175
02:32:36.480 --> 02:32:41.480
<v Speaker 4>someone told me that the amount of</v>
<v Speaker 4>chemicals they had to give to rats,</v>

3176
02:32:43.260 --> 02:32:45.780
<v Speaker 4>the amount of aspartame,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they had to give the rats to kill them</v>

3177
02:32:46.050 --> 02:32:48.420
<v Speaker 4>or to give them cancer was very high and</v>

3179
02:32:50.700 --> 02:32:53.880
<v Speaker 4>That's reassuring,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's a great book about the</v>

3180
02:32:53.881 --> 02:32:57.080
<v Speaker 4>corruption of the pharmaceutical</v>
<v Speaker 4>companies and it's a.</v>

3182
02:33:01.740 --> 02:33:06.740
<v Speaker 4>wrote a book called confessions of an Rx</v>
<v Speaker 4>drug pusher and I think it was her niece</v>

3183
02:33:07.201 --> 02:33:10.680
<v Speaker 4>died of a drug interaction that they</v>
<v Speaker 4>knew about and she exposed the whole</v>

3184
02:33:10.681 --> 02:33:12.570
<v Speaker 4>corruption in the pharmaceutical</v>
<v Speaker 4>industry.</v>

3185
02:33:12.571 --> 02:33:17.571
<v Speaker 4>She was a top pharmaceutical rep and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they said they know how does a drug get</v>

3186
02:33:17.671 --> 02:33:22.671
<v Speaker 4>approved by the FDA and then they turn</v>
<v Speaker 4>around and fucking they pull it and</v>

3187
02:33:23.370 --> 02:33:26.730
<v Speaker 4>people are dying and they settle for</v>
<v Speaker 4>pennies on the dollar.</v>

3188
02:33:26.731 --> 02:33:29.730
<v Speaker 4>That's the fucking game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They know there's going to be lawsuits</v>

3189
02:33:30.360 --> 02:33:31.710
<v Speaker 4>and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

3190
02:33:31.711 --> 02:33:35.550
<v Speaker 4>we just made $3,000,000,000 off this</v>
<v Speaker 4>drug and we settled that lawsuit for</v>

3191
02:33:35.551 --> 02:33:38.470
<v Speaker 4>$200 billion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's a hundred million,</v>

3192
02:33:38.500 --> 02:33:39.600
<v Speaker 4>200 million.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3193
02:33:39.601 --> 02:33:41.930
<v Speaker 4>So that's the game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's.</v>

3194
02:33:42.180 --> 02:33:43.500
<v Speaker 4>But her book is amazing.</v>

3195
02:33:43.500 --> 02:33:47.220
<v Speaker 4>It's called confessions of an Rx drug</v>
<v Speaker 4>pusher and that's what she was.</v>

3196
02:33:47.221 --> 02:33:50.700
<v Speaker 4>And she would buy out the doctors.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Half the people that they put on these</v>

3197
02:33:50.701 --> 02:33:53.820
<v Speaker 4>medications,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Let thy food be thy medicine and</v>
<v Speaker 4>medicine be thy food.</v>

3215
02:34:27.341 --> 02:34:31.660
<v Speaker 2>like forks over knives where there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>anecdotal evidence that says,</v>

3216

<v Speaker 2>Yo,</v>

<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3220
02:34:41.170 --> 02:34:44.830
<v Speaker 2>is cured by the fact that these people</v>
<v Speaker 2>get to assets moving and they stopped</v>

3221
02:34:44.831 --> 02:34:46.150
<v Speaker 2>eating all this shitty food.</v>

3222
02:34:46.640 --> 02:34:49.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shitty food is the number one problem is</v>

3223
02:34:49.020 --> 02:34:50.660
<v Speaker 3>the number one problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sugar,</v>

3224
02:34:50.840 --> 02:34:54.770
<v Speaker 3>refined carbohydrates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your body processing massive amounts of</v>

3225
02:34:54.771 --> 02:34:58.100
<v Speaker 3>stuff that it's not supposed to get in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything boils in everything.</v>

3226
02:34:58.101 --> 02:35:01.560
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these processed vegetable oils like</v>

02:35:03.290 --> 02:35:06.410
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And People Think,</v>

3229
02:35:06.411 --> 02:35:07.690
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>what do you got here,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Donald run.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the FDA actually banned aspartame</v>

3233
02:35:14.600 --> 02:35:19.310
<v Speaker 3>based on his findings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>only to have cereal chairman Donald</v>

3234
02:35:19.310 --> 02:35:21.290
<v Speaker 3>Rumsfeld,</v>
<v Speaker 3>currently secretary of defense at the</v>

3235
02:35:21.291 --> 02:35:25.970
<v Speaker 3>time they wrote this article,</v>
<v Speaker 3>vow to call in his markers to get it</v>

3236
02:35:25.971 --> 02:35:30.830
<v Speaker 3>approved on January 21st 1991 the day</v>
<v Speaker 3>after Ronald Reagan's inauguration.</v>

3237
02:35:31.460 --> 02:35:36.230
<v Speaker 3>Cyril,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess that's c a r l e reapply to the</v>

3238
02:35:36.231 --> 02:35:40.910
<v Speaker 3>FDA for approval to use aspartame.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And food sweetener and Reagan's new FDA</v>

3239
02:35:40.911 --> 02:35:45.911
<v Speaker 3>Commissioner Arthur Hayes Hall junior</v>
<v Speaker 3>appointed a five person scientific</v>

3240
02:35:46.071 --> 02:35:48.950
<v Speaker 3>commission to review the board of</v>
<v Speaker 3>inquiry.</v>

3241
02:35:48.951 --> 02:35:52.310
<v Speaker 3>Decision became clear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The panel would uphold the band by a</v>

3242
02:35:52.311 --> 02:35:54.540
<v Speaker 3>three to two to two decision,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then hold,</v>

3243
02:35:54.541 --> 02:35:58.250
<v Speaker 3>then install the sixth member on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>commission and the vote became</v>

3244
02:35:58.251 --> 02:36:01.760
<v Speaker 3>deadlocked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He then personally broke the tie and</v>

3245
02:36:01.761 --> 02:36:04.400
<v Speaker 3>aspartame favor what a piece of shit.</v>

3246
02:36:04.530 --> 02:36:06.090
<v Speaker 2>But this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this puts,</v>

3247
02:36:06.200 --> 02:36:09.090
<v Speaker 2>they found evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This shit makes holes in the brain.</v>

3248
02:36:09.120 --> 02:36:13.440
<v Speaker 3>It might induce the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The evidence grains might induce</v>

3249
02:36:13.590 --> 02:36:14.730
<v Speaker 3>migraine tumors.</v>

3250
02:36:15.650 --> 02:36:18.440
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the thing is now everyone got hipped</v>

3251
02:36:18.441 --> 02:36:22.520
<v Speaker 2>to aspartame.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you have to read because that's why</v>

3252
02:36:22.521 --> 02:36:26.720
<v Speaker 2>the process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Food is so fucking any of that here,</v>

3253
02:36:26.721 --> 02:36:30.410
<v Speaker 2>that fake sweetness shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now they call it amino suite is the</v>

3254
02:36:30.411 --> 02:36:32.890
<v Speaker 2>new name that they changed it to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

3255
02:36:33.220 --> 02:36:33.800
<v Speaker 3>Well you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

3256
02:36:33.800 --> 02:36:36.050
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever drink your drinks?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Soda,</v>

3257
02:36:37.340 --> 02:36:39.890
<v Speaker 3>Soda sweetened with Stevia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stevia.</v>

3258
02:36:40.070 --> 02:36:42.620
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stevia's from plants.</v>

3259
02:36:42.670 --> 02:36:45.550
<v Speaker 3>It's a sweetener and people don't like</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

3260
02:36:45.580 --> 02:36:49.180
<v Speaker 2>great taste of Stevia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It tastes good.</v>

3261
02:36:49.210 --> 02:36:53.660
<v Speaker 2>But I do have too much protein powders</v>
<v Speaker 2>that have a,</v>

3262
02:36:53.661 --> 02:36:56.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Stevia in it and stuff.</v>

3263
02:36:56.950 --> 02:37:01.680
<v Speaker 2>Clean machine has a protein powder</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a lentin and uh,</v>

3264
02:37:01.710 --> 02:37:03.430
<v Speaker 2>the water lentils,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they call them.</v>

3265
02:37:03.431 --> 02:37:04.510
<v Speaker 2>It's real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>real clean.</v>

3266
02:37:04.650 --> 02:37:05.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are on it.</v>

3267
02:37:05.611 --> 02:37:07.620
<v Speaker 3>Hemp force protein.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were using Stevia.</v>

3268
02:37:07.621 --> 02:37:09.430
<v Speaker 3>Stevia for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've called Stevia nuts,</v>

3269
02:37:09.450 --> 02:37:12.240
<v Speaker 3>debbie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that title potato,</v>

3270
02:37:12.241 --> 02:37:15.380
<v Speaker 3>which just doesn't taste the same,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tastes good.</v>

3271
02:37:15.590 --> 02:37:16.070
<v Speaker 3>It's a matter</v>

3272
02:37:16.070 --> 02:37:17.360
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's so potent.</v>

3273
02:37:17.361 --> 02:37:19.370
<v Speaker 1>The problem is like if people have a cup</v>
<v Speaker 1>of coffee,</v>

3274
02:37:19.371 --> 02:37:21.680
<v Speaker 1>I would have stevie out and people put</v>
<v Speaker 1>it in there and be like,</v>

3275
02:37:21.740 --> 02:37:22.630
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

3276
02:37:22.640 --> 02:37:24.890
<v Speaker 1>you put too much in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can't put it in like sugar.</v>

3277
02:37:24.980 --> 02:37:27.560
<v Speaker 1>That's way more potent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just need a tiny dash.</v>

3278
02:37:27.920 --> 02:37:30.770
<v Speaker 1>Like even back in the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember my mom being like,</v>

3279
02:37:30.771 --> 02:37:31.431
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yay,</v>

3280
02:37:31.431 --> 02:37:35.720
<v Speaker 1>nutrasweet and this and that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's put all these other like,</v>

3281
02:37:36.110 --> 02:37:40.640
<v Speaker 1>cane sugar is better for you than these</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking fake sweeteners.</v>

3282
02:37:41.540 --> 02:37:44.920
<v Speaker 1>Sugar still terrible for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Terrible for you.</v>

3283
02:37:44.970 --> 02:37:47.090
<v Speaker 1>You're not close as a sugar daddy in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>

3284
02:37:47.610 --> 02:37:50.270
<v Speaker 1>You're going to do sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should do eat fruit.</v>

3285
02:37:51.060 --> 02:37:54.050
<v Speaker 1>Come to the fibers in your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slowly digesting it,</v>

3286
02:37:54.051 --> 02:37:55.610
<v Speaker 1>which is the way you're supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>consume it,</v>

3287
02:37:56.060 --> 02:37:58.490
<v Speaker 1>but you'd be able to get like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>gatorade.</v>

3288
02:37:58.491 --> 02:38:00.710
<v Speaker 1>It's got like fucking 80 grams of sugar</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're like,</v>

3289
02:38:00.711 --> 02:38:02.060
<v Speaker 1>that shit's terrible for you.</v>

3290
02:38:02.300 --> 02:38:04.250
<v Speaker 1>All that stuff terrible for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Soda,</v>

3291
02:38:04.251 --> 02:38:07.070
<v Speaker 1>and they got all the pros pushing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like these kids,</v>

3292
02:38:07.550 --> 02:38:11.180
<v Speaker 1>you go to these a basketball camp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so football cancel or whatever,</v>

3293
02:38:11.181 --> 02:38:12.950
<v Speaker 1>or high schools and what are they</v>
<v Speaker 1>drinking?</v>

3294
02:38:13.010 --> 02:38:15.200
<v Speaker 1>They're all drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drinking the Koolaid.</v>

3295
02:38:15.560 --> 02:38:16.400
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

3296
02:38:16.401 --> 02:38:19.760
<v Speaker 1>if you're exerting yourself like very</v>
<v Speaker 1>strenuously,</v>

3297
02:38:19.761 --> 02:38:21.920
<v Speaker 1>you could use some of that glucose and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's okay,</v>

3298
02:38:22.310 --> 02:38:26.600
<v Speaker 1>but for the average person that goes to</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fucking 7:11 and gets a big gulp and</v>

3299
02:38:26.601 --> 02:38:27.770
<v Speaker 1>his downing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3300
02:38:28.250 --> 02:38:32.540
<v Speaker 1>64 ounces of Coca Cola,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is a crazy amount of sugar for your</v>

3301
02:38:32.541 --> 02:38:35.180
<v Speaker 1>body to get in one serving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your body doesn't know what to do with</v>

3302
02:38:35.181 --> 02:38:37.010
<v Speaker 1>that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it stores it as fat.</v>

3303
02:38:37.190 --> 02:38:42.190
<v Speaker 1>What I forget how many tablespoons of</v>
<v Speaker 1>sugar they said he's in one of them.</v>

3304
02:38:42.380 --> 02:38:45.980
<v Speaker 1>Fucking a big gulp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they did a thing where they showed</v>

3305
02:38:46.160 --> 02:38:51.160
<v Speaker 1>all the various sizes of soda next to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have the sugar and you see the actual,</v>

3306
02:38:52.460 --> 02:38:55.640
<v Speaker 1>the actual sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

3307
02:38:55.641 --> 02:38:57.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is our number one problem and one</v>

3308
02:38:57.711 --> 02:38:59.890
<v Speaker 1>of the things that I did when I cut</v>
<v Speaker 1>sugar out of my died,</v>

3309
02:38:59.891 --> 02:39:04.620
<v Speaker 1>there it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the image that's a kilo of coke</v>

3310
02:39:04.710 --> 02:39:07.020
<v Speaker 1>son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sides of that.</v>

3311
02:39:07.230 --> 02:39:10.940
<v Speaker 1>That's so much sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your body doesn't know what the fuck's</v>

3312
02:39:10.941 --> 02:39:14.750
<v Speaker 1>going on when you take that much sugar</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's insane and it's freaking thing</v>

3313
02:39:14.751 --> 02:39:17.920
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got kids jacked up on that all day</v>

3314
02:39:17.920 --> 02:39:19.600
<v Speaker 1>long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bouncing off the wall.</v>

3315
02:39:19.710 --> 02:39:21.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they put them on Ritalin</v>

3316
02:39:21.141 --> 02:39:24.020
<v Speaker 1>because Johnny's got too much energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Johnny's on drugs.</v>

3317
02:39:24.021 --> 02:39:24.980
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sugar drug</v>

3318
02:39:25.300 --> 02:39:26.570
<v Speaker 3>long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3319
02:39:26.571 --> 02:39:28.420
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then on top of that,</v>

3320
02:39:28.480 --> 02:39:33.480
<v Speaker 3>here's one of the problems with people</v>
<v Speaker 3>consuming that kind of stuff and then on</v>

3321
02:39:33.881 --> 02:39:36.920
<v Speaker 3>top of it's saturated fat or your kids</v>
<v Speaker 3>set.</v>

3322
02:39:37.180 --> 02:39:39.160
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's studies now that are showing</v>

3323
02:39:39.340 --> 02:39:44.050
<v Speaker 3>that cholesterol and saturated fat are</v>
<v Speaker 3>healthy for your diet and healthy for</v>

3324
02:39:44.051 --> 02:39:47.740
<v Speaker 3>your body in less.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're consuming carbohydrates and</v>

3325
02:39:47.741 --> 02:39:49.900
<v Speaker 3>refined sugars because when you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

3326
02:39:49.901 --> 02:39:53.620
<v Speaker 3>then your body's not burning fat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so your body is just storing fat and on</v>

3327
02:39:53.621 --> 02:39:56.620
<v Speaker 3>top of that you're pouring massive</v>
<v Speaker 3>amounts of sugar in there,</v>

3328
02:39:56.621 --> 02:39:59.440
<v Speaker 3>so you're getting hardening of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>arteries and clogging of the arteries</v>

3329
02:39:59.770 --> 02:40:03.850
<v Speaker 3>and people think that this is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're conflating and confusing all</v>

3330
02:40:03.851 --> 02:40:04.690
<v Speaker 3>this and thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3331
02:40:05.050 --> 02:40:06.880
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is because you're eating</v>

3332
02:40:06.910 --> 02:40:08.770
<v Speaker 3>cholesterol and saturated fat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nope,</v>

3333
02:40:08.980 --> 02:40:10.660
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's because you're eating cholesterol</v>

3334
02:40:10.661 --> 02:40:13.890
<v Speaker 3>and saturated fat along with simple</v>
<v Speaker 3>carbohydrates,</v>

3335
02:40:13.891 --> 02:40:17.490
<v Speaker 3>refined carbohydrates and sugars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a chemical reaction that your</v>

3336
02:40:17.491 --> 02:40:21.180
<v Speaker 3>body has that when you're eating these</v>
<v Speaker 3>two things together becomes toxic.</v>

3337
02:40:21.390 --> 02:40:21.860
<v Speaker 3>It's</v>

3338
02:40:21.860 --> 02:40:23.990
<v Speaker 2>dangerous night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trust Semites as well.</v>

3339
02:40:23.991 --> 02:40:26.470
<v Speaker 2>When you say that's the average American</v>
<v Speaker 2>diet,</v>

3340
02:40:26.540 --> 02:40:29.300
<v Speaker 2>and then combine it with alcohol and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>rest of this stuff,</v>

3341
02:40:29.301 --> 02:40:34.301
<v Speaker 2>it creates a a chemical reaction in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>body that then causes a problems for you</v>

3342
02:40:36.801 --> 02:40:40.100
<v Speaker 2>health wise and your immune system and</v>
<v Speaker 2>gut health and everything else.</v>

3343
02:40:40.310 --> 02:40:41.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's A.</v>

3344
02:40:41.080 --> 02:40:46.080
<v Speaker 3>There's a ton of problems with people's</v>
<v Speaker 3>bodies and you could trace it back to a</v>

3345
02:40:47.240 --> 02:40:48.690
<v Speaker 3>host of different things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could.</v>

3346
02:40:48.720 --> 02:40:52.910
<v Speaker 3>You could trace it back to pesticides.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could trace it back to a lack of</v>

3347
02:40:52.911 --> 02:40:55.550
<v Speaker 3>minerals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can trace it back to excess sugar,</v>

3348
02:40:55.670 --> 02:40:57.890
<v Speaker 3>you can trace it back to processed</v>
<v Speaker 3>vegetable oils,</v>

3349
02:40:57.891 --> 02:41:00.170
<v Speaker 3>you can trace it back to sedentary</v>
<v Speaker 3>lives.</v>

3350
02:41:00.200 --> 02:41:05.200
<v Speaker 3>There's so many different things that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are a factor in people's health issues,</v>

3351
02:41:05.960 --> 02:41:09.860
<v Speaker 3>but one of the problems with ideologies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's this carnivore diet</v>

3352
02:41:09.861 --> 02:41:14.000
<v Speaker 3>ideology or Vegan Diet audiology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is people want to look at one thing.</v>

3353
02:41:14.001 --> 02:41:16.700
<v Speaker 3>There's one thing that's wrong and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>fix this thing,</v>

3354
02:41:16.701 --> 02:41:19.010
<v Speaker 3>and if you just do this one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be healthy.</v>

3355
02:41:19.040 --> 02:41:22.610
<v Speaker 3>That's not necessarily the case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's a lot of people out there on</v>

3356
02:41:22.611 --> 02:41:26.750
<v Speaker 3>both sides that are spreading</v>
<v Speaker 3>misinformation because it supports their</v>

3357
02:41:26.751 --> 02:41:29.230
<v Speaker 3>view.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It supports their bias positioning</v>

3358
02:41:29.390 --> 02:41:34.250
<v Speaker 2>studies that were funded by the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>companies that are making money off of</v>

3359
02:41:34.251 --> 02:41:39.251
<v Speaker 2>selling foods that are high in saturated</v>
<v Speaker 2>fats or cholesterol or trans fats,</v>

3360
02:41:40.460 --> 02:41:42.260
<v Speaker 2>trans fats in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's companies.</v>

3361
02:41:42.410 --> 02:41:46.040
<v Speaker 2>So you always have to look between the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking lines.</v>

3362
02:41:46.070 --> 02:41:50.570
<v Speaker 2>That's where the truth lies because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>milk industries.</v>

3363
02:41:51.180 --> 02:41:52.490
<v Speaker 2>What was the other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3364
02:41:52.640 --> 02:41:55.450
<v Speaker 2>the other documentary that came out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3365
02:41:56.690 --> 02:42:00.140
<v Speaker 2>fuck it was about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It started with the cigarettes and the</v>

3366
02:42:00.141 --> 02:42:02.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the chemicals that they were using</v>

3367
02:42:02.031 --> 02:42:04.940
<v Speaker 2>in furniture day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was this documentary to,</v>

3368
02:42:04.970 --> 02:42:08.780
<v Speaker 2>and I always blank on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking old man brain and I have.</v>

3369
02:42:08.810 --> 02:42:13.400
<v Speaker 2>It was a documentary about how they paid</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people to put out false</v>

3370
02:42:13.430 --> 02:42:14.080
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>

3371
02:42:14.080 --> 02:42:15.640
<v Speaker 3>I know you're talking about merchants of</v>
<v Speaker 3>death,</v>

3372
02:42:15.700 --> 02:42:18.970
<v Speaker 3>merchants of doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing fucking shame.</v>

3373
02:42:18.971 --> 02:42:22.780
<v Speaker 3>People that are doubting climate change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're also touting cigarettes being</v>

3374
02:42:22.781 --> 02:42:24.210
<v Speaker 3>addicted the same</v>

3375
02:42:24.660 --> 02:42:29.660
<v Speaker 2>and they're using the same tactics that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've been using and to push the</v>

3376
02:42:30.531 --> 02:42:35.360
<v Speaker 2>chemicals and put.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had motherfuckers spraying DDT on</v>

3377
02:42:35.361 --> 02:42:38.630
<v Speaker 2>their fucking clothes hanging in their</v>
<v Speaker 2>closet to stop moths.</v>

3378

<v Speaker 2>Can you fucking believe that shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

3379
02:42:42.380 --> 02:42:46.010

<v Speaker 2>fucking Dick Cancer causing chemicals on</v>
<v Speaker 2>this shit.</v>

3381
02:42:52.060 --> 02:42:54.490
<v Speaker 3>When you see those guys have the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys that were trying to say that</v>

3382
02:42:54.491 --> 02:42:57.700
<v Speaker 3>cigarettes are not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not addictive and the same</v>

3383
02:42:57.701 --> 02:43:00.640
<v Speaker 3>people that are there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were dismissing climate change.</v>

3384
02:43:00.641 --> 02:43:02.020
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

3414
02:44:15.421 --> 02:44:19.620
<v Speaker 2>enter the body is not by walking around</v>
<v Speaker 2>the streets of La or New York and</v>

3415
02:44:19.621 --> 02:44:22.200
<v Speaker 2>breathing into pollution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the fucking home,</v>

3416
02:44:22.560 --> 02:44:25.920
<v Speaker 2>the amount of chemicals that are in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking home,</v>

3417
02:44:25.921 --> 02:44:29.730
<v Speaker 2>and they talk about that in merchants of</v>
<v Speaker 2>doubt to chemicals in the furniture,</v>

3418
02:44:29.731 --> 02:44:33.000
<v Speaker 2>the chemicals in the closed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the chemicals in the fucking diapers to</v>

3419
02:44:33.001 --> 02:44:36.240
<v Speaker 2>chemicals in everything in the plastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's chemicals,</v>

3420
02:44:36.241 --> 02:44:37.230
<v Speaker 2>chemicals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chemicals,</v>

3421
02:44:37.231 --> 02:44:40.290
<v Speaker 2>chemicals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're bombarding your fucking child</v>

3422
02:44:40.680 --> 02:44:44.880
<v Speaker 2>with fucking dozens and dozens of</v>
<v Speaker 2>chemicals every fucking day.</v>

3423
02:44:45.330 --> 02:44:49.410
<v Speaker 2>And while it's immune throughout that</v>
<v Speaker 2>child's immune system is developing and</v>

3424
02:44:49.411 --> 02:44:51.690
<v Speaker 2>then you're feeding it pesticides,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're feeding it.</v>

3425
02:44:52.020 --> 02:44:54.120
<v Speaker 2>This fucking animal that's been</v>
<v Speaker 2>tortured.</v>

3426
02:44:54.121 --> 02:44:56.940
<v Speaker 2>It's whole life and Fed fucking steroids</v>
<v Speaker 2>and hormones.</v>

3427
02:44:56.970 --> 02:45:01.320
<v Speaker 2>And you're wondering why these kids are</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming out and they're so fucked because</v>

3428
02:45:01.321 --> 02:45:03.810
<v Speaker 2>it's when they're getting into their</v>
<v Speaker 2>teens,</v>

3429
02:45:03.811 --> 02:45:06.660
<v Speaker 2>it's because all of that shit's taken a</v>
<v Speaker 2>toll.</v>

3430
02:45:06.780 --> 02:45:09.020
<v Speaker 2>Not just physically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

3431
02:45:09.570 --> 02:45:11.660
<v Speaker 2>psychologically it's fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3432
02:45:11.940 --> 02:45:12.773
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>

3433
02:45:12.940 --> 02:45:15.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so much other shit they're doing</v>

3434
02:45:15.510 --> 02:45:16.140
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the,</v>

3435
02:45:16.140 --> 02:45:17.580
<v Speaker 2>to the food put in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put in.</v>

3436
02:45:17.581 --> 02:45:20.170
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an episode,</v>

3437
02:45:20.280 --> 02:45:22.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they put in the corn and the soy</v>

3438
02:45:22.321 --> 02:45:24.130
<v Speaker 2>now and it's fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3439
02:45:24.150 --> 02:45:27.330
<v Speaker 2>it was done by this company in La and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will,</v>

3440
02:45:27.370 --> 02:45:29.400
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was down in California somewhere,</v>

3441
02:45:29.401 --> 02:45:31.950
<v Speaker 2>episode e p I c Dot y,</v>
<v Speaker 2>t,</v>

3442
02:45:32.310 --> 02:45:35.680
<v Speaker 2>and it fucks with the sexual</v>
<v Speaker 2>reproduction organs of,</v>

3443
02:45:35.700 --> 02:45:39.090
<v Speaker 2>of fetuses and children and all kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit they do.</v>

3444
02:45:39.150 --> 02:45:43.650
<v Speaker 2>They're conducting like fucking mad</v>
<v Speaker 2>science on human beings right now.</v>

3445
02:45:43.651 --> 02:45:47.230
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just for profit even in Hawaiian,</v>

3446
02:45:47.260 --> 02:45:49.530
<v Speaker 2>I got to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have friends that are out there and</v>

3447
02:45:49.531 --> 02:45:51.470
<v Speaker 2>they did organic farming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>organic farming.</v>

3448
02:45:51.480 --> 02:45:54.690
<v Speaker 2>Do you know that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the world seed banks right now for</v>

3449
02:45:54.691 --> 02:45:59.691
<v Speaker 2>GMO or fucking grown in Hawaii</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of it's a closed ecosystem</v>

3450
02:46:02.400 --> 02:46:05.370
<v Speaker 2>that's closed off from everywhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's no other factors.</v>

3451
02:46:05.760 --> 02:46:09.030
<v Speaker 2>So they go and they spray motherfucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>chem trails,</v>

3452
02:46:09.200 --> 02:46:10.033
<v Speaker 2>the air</v>

3453
02:46:10.220 --> 02:46:12.980
<v Speaker 4>that calmed down onto the fucking ground</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they can,</v>

3454
02:46:13.490 --> 02:46:15.140
<v Speaker 4>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I wait a minute,</v>

3455
02:46:15.290 --> 02:46:19.130
<v Speaker 4>what do they do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're spraying aerosol spraying the</v>

3456
02:46:19.131 --> 02:46:20.840
<v Speaker 4>crops.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the aerosol,</v>

3457
02:46:20.841 --> 02:46:25.841
<v Speaker 4>so some sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what they do and they do aluminum.</v>

3458
02:46:26.031 --> 02:46:27.200
<v Speaker 4>Barium,</v>
<v Speaker 4>strontium.</v>

3459
02:46:27.201 --> 02:46:28.520
<v Speaker 4>Now I'm going to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have,</v>

3460
02:46:28.640 --> 02:46:30.650
<v Speaker 4>I have friends that actually are doing</v>
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

3461
02:46:31.400 --> 02:46:34.970
<v Speaker 4>They were aghast farmers and I had to</v>
<v Speaker 4>give up their farm and what they do is</v>

3462
02:46:34.971 --> 02:46:37.220
<v Speaker 4>they make the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the uh,</v>

3463
02:46:37.430 --> 02:46:42.430
<v Speaker 4>the making the soil so acidic the Ph,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then nothing will grow except for</v>

3464
02:46:43.850 --> 02:46:48.680
<v Speaker 4>genetically modified seeds that have</v>
<v Speaker 4>been genetically modified to resist</v>

3465
02:46:48.681 --> 02:46:50.660
<v Speaker 4>aluminum and resist all this other</v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

3466
02:46:50.661 --> 02:46:52.940
<v Speaker 4>So now the spraying aluminum,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like where's that coming from?</v>

3467
02:46:52.970 --> 02:46:54.170
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it makes it,</v>

3468
02:46:54.171 --> 02:46:58.820
<v Speaker 4>makes the soil various civic it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it changes the Ph.</v>

3469
02:46:58.821 --> 02:47:03.821
<v Speaker 4>I think aluminum has the greatest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a change to the soil and what's the</v>

3470
02:47:03.981 --> 02:47:08.330
<v Speaker 4>benefit of them doing that because then</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can control the food supply because</v>

3471
02:47:08.331 --> 02:47:11.900
<v Speaker 4>if you don't buy the GMO seeds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the organic farmers are going out of</v>

3472
02:47:11.901 --> 02:47:13.040
<v Speaker 4>business in Hawaii.</v>

3473
02:47:13.040 --> 02:47:14.510
<v Speaker 4>And this ain't no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute.</v>

3474
02:47:14.511 --> 02:47:18.320
<v Speaker 4>So you're saying that they're spreading</v>
<v Speaker 4>things out of the sky that poisoned the</v>

3475
02:47:18.321 --> 02:47:23.321
<v Speaker 4>ground so that only organic farmers are</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that only gmo farmers can grow crops</v>

3476
02:47:25.011 --> 02:47:25.844
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3477
02:47:26.080 --> 02:47:28.440
<v Speaker 4>That's proven.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what's going on.</v>

3478
02:47:28.441 --> 02:47:31.520
<v Speaker 4>And it sounds crazy though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but here's the thing,</v>

3479
02:47:31.880 --> 02:47:35.030
<v Speaker 4>and I'm not saying they're going like</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of these other camp trail people,</v>

3480
02:47:35.031 --> 02:47:37.280
<v Speaker 4>$35,000,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're spraying all the cities I'm</v>

3481
02:47:37.281 --> 02:47:40.070
<v Speaker 4>spraying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying that coming in and spraying</v>

3482
02:47:40.130 --> 02:47:45.110
<v Speaker 4>chemicals on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're not doing it as a pesticide.</v>

3483
02:47:45.111 --> 02:47:48.320
<v Speaker 4>You're saying they're doing it as a</v>
<v Speaker 4>grand conspiracy to make the ground</v>

3484
02:47:48.440 --> 02:47:51.500
<v Speaker 4>infertile for anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you ever read Monsanto's.</v>

3485
02:47:51.530 --> 02:47:53.720
<v Speaker 4>Did you ever see the world according to</v>
<v Speaker 4>Monsanto?</v>

3486
02:47:54.050 --> 02:47:55.310
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what do they say?</v>

3487
02:47:55.311 --> 02:48:00.311
<v Speaker 4>We want to control the world's food</v>
<v Speaker 4>supply from seed to motherfucking to</v>

3488
02:48:01.190 --> 02:48:03.610
<v Speaker 4>farm to table,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the way through.</v>

3489
02:48:03.690 --> 02:48:04.730
<v Speaker 4>We want to control.</v>

3490
02:48:04.850 --> 02:48:09.350
<v Speaker 4>So how did they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do they actually make that happen?</v>

3491
02:48:10.280 --> 02:48:15.050
<v Speaker 4>And I see it happening to farmers in</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hawaii and friends of mine are ag.</v>

3492
02:48:15.051 --> 02:48:17.890
<v Speaker 4>I just did ironman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you see happening?</v>

3493
02:48:17.900 --> 02:48:19.680
<v Speaker 4>Because what they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3494
02:48:19.690 --> 02:48:20.170
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3495
02:48:20.170 --> 02:48:23.600
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the organic Papaya farmers have had to</v>

3496
02:48:23.601 --> 02:48:28.601
<v Speaker 4>all go either give up their farm or go</v>
<v Speaker 4>switch to a GMO Papaya because none of</v>

3497
02:48:30.471 --> 02:48:33.710
<v Speaker 4>their shit is growing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just that because the depletion of</v>

3498
02:48:33.711 --> 02:48:35.560
<v Speaker 4>the soil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not it's,</v>

3499
02:48:35.780 --> 02:48:40.780
<v Speaker 4>but they say that the fucking day</v>
<v Speaker 4>spraying the chemicals on the soil,</v>

3500
02:48:40.880 --> 02:48:44.560
<v Speaker 4>but do you know how much they'd have to</v>
<v Speaker 4>spray on the soil to make it infertile?</v>

3501
02:48:45.230 --> 02:48:48.710
<v Speaker 4>It's much more likely candidate to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>same issues that we're having in this</v>

3502
02:48:48.711 --> 02:48:52.310
<v Speaker 4>country with mono crops that they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>just depleting their soil because</v>

3503
02:48:52.311 --> 02:48:53.710
<v Speaker 4>they're constantly growing on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3504
02:48:53.720 --> 02:48:57.710
<v Speaker 4>because these guys are doing organic</v>
<v Speaker 4>study chem trails that study chem trails</v>

3505
02:48:57.711 --> 02:49:00.800
<v Speaker 4>for quite a while because I was doing a</v>
<v Speaker 4>television show on them and one of the</v>

3506
02:49:00.801 --> 02:49:03.860
<v Speaker 4>things that I found with this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a lot of Malarkey.</v>

3507
02:49:04.310 --> 02:49:07.040
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and one of the things that they find is</v>

3508
02:49:07.290 --> 02:49:07.921
<v Speaker 4>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3509
02:49:07.921 --> 02:49:08.070
<v Speaker 4>they're</v>

3510
02:49:08.070 --> 02:49:12.120
<v Speaker 3>spraying aluminum and then when they do</v>
<v Speaker 3>samples of the water,</v>

3511
02:49:12.270 --> 02:49:16.230
<v Speaker 3>they find aluminum in the water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now they're doing samples of sludge.</v>

3512
02:49:16.420 --> 02:49:20.760
<v Speaker 3>This do samples of water with dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know with one of the most common</v>

3513
02:49:20.761 --> 02:49:23.520
<v Speaker 3>metals that you'll ever find on earth is</v>
<v Speaker 3>aluminum.</v>

3514
02:49:23.521 --> 02:49:25.740
<v Speaker 3>Aluminum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most dirt has aluminum in it,</v>

3515
02:49:25.741 --> 02:49:28.800
<v Speaker 3>so when they're testing this water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're testing positive for aluminum.</v>

3516
02:49:29.070 --> 02:49:32.790
<v Speaker 3>What they're doing is it tested dirt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dirt tested positive for being dirt.</v>

3517
02:49:32.940 --> 02:49:34.950
<v Speaker 3>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when they find a aluminum,</v>

3518
02:49:34.951 --> 02:49:35.611
<v Speaker 3>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

3519
02:49:35.611 --> 02:49:38.520
<v Speaker 3>they're spraying aluminum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no benefit to spraying aluminum</v>

3520
02:49:38.521 --> 02:49:41.190
<v Speaker 3>on anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's never been proven that there's some</v>

3521
02:49:41.220 --> 02:49:44.700
<v Speaker 3>evil government cabal that wants to</v>
<v Speaker 3>spray aluminum on everything and that's</v>

3522
02:49:44.701 --> 02:49:47.160
<v Speaker 3>the reason why papayas don't grow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3523
02:49:47.340 --> 02:49:50.880
<v Speaker 3>It's way more likely that these papayas</v>
<v Speaker 3>are growing in a place where they've</v>

3524
02:49:50.900 --> 02:49:54.240
<v Speaker 3>been grown papayas for a long time and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've depleted the soil,</v>

3525
02:49:54.390 --> 02:49:57.540
<v Speaker 3>especially dealing with soil that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>really coming out of a volcano in the</v>

3526
02:49:57.541 --> 02:49:58.100
<v Speaker 3>first place.</v>

3527
02:49:58.100 --> 02:50:01.280
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I understand that aspect of it,</v>

3528
02:50:01.281 --> 02:50:04.820
<v Speaker 2>but it's the combination of other</v>
<v Speaker 2>chemicals that they're using.</v>

3529
02:50:04.821 --> 02:50:09.110
<v Speaker 2>And here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Before these seed banks showed up over</v>

3530
02:50:09.111 --> 02:50:10.900
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they never had this problem.</v>

3531
02:50:11.020 --> 02:50:14.650
<v Speaker 3>There's also before large scale</v>
<v Speaker 3>agriculture made its way to Hawaii as</v>

3532
02:50:14.651 --> 02:50:15.191
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3533
02:50:15.191 --> 02:50:18.580
<v Speaker 3>So they probably had years and years and</v>
<v Speaker 3>years of doing this and getting away</v>

3534
02:50:18.581 --> 02:50:21.010
<v Speaker 3>with it to the soil started getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>depleted.</v>

3535
02:50:21.370 --> 02:50:23.830
<v Speaker 3>Just like we have evidence of it getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>depleted all over the world.</v>

3536
02:50:24.070 --> 02:50:25.600
<v Speaker 3>India,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have issues with this,</v>

3537
02:50:25.601 --> 02:50:27.880
<v Speaker 3>with mono crops,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with anywhere in the world where they</v>

3538
02:50:27.881 --> 02:50:31.930
<v Speaker 3>grow crops in the same area,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in these massive scales,</v>

3539
02:50:32.170 --> 02:50:34.870
<v Speaker 3>you're going to deplete the ground of</v>
<v Speaker 3>minerals and nutrients.</v>

3540
02:50:34.871 --> 02:50:39.070
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just a part of the problem</v>
<v Speaker 3>and when they offer up that solution</v>

3541
02:50:39.071 --> 02:50:39.401
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

3542
02:50:39.401 --> 02:50:42.850
<v Speaker 3>our genetically modified crops are</v>
<v Speaker 3>better in are genetically,</v>

3543
02:50:43.180 --> 02:50:45.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people modified crops are,</v>

3544
02:50:45.211 --> 02:50:47.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can survive in these harsh climates</v>

3545
02:50:47.921 --> 02:50:52.921
<v Speaker 3>and you can also add all of our nitrogen</v>
<v Speaker 3>and our fertilizers are nasty shit to</v>

3546
02:50:53.271 --> 02:50:54.104
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>

3547
02:50:54.150 --> 02:50:59.150
<v Speaker 2>Everything else around it will die when</v>
<v Speaker 2>we spray except for our crops because</v>

3548
02:50:59.281 --> 02:51:02.040
<v Speaker 2>we've been genetically engineered to</v>
<v Speaker 2>resist.</v>

3549
02:51:02.700 --> 02:51:05.370
<v Speaker 2>We been genetically engineered to</v>
<v Speaker 2>resist.</v>

3550
02:51:06.230 --> 02:51:09.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's scary.</v>

3551
02:51:09.040 --> 02:51:11.920
<v Speaker 3>That glyphosate shit is any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything that kills everything.</v>

3552
02:51:11.921 --> 02:51:13.840
<v Speaker 3>But what you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you want it to is like what?</v>

3553
02:51:13.900 --> 02:51:15.760
<v Speaker 3>Like what's it doing to what you wanted</v>
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>

3554
02:51:15.900 --> 02:51:19.870
<v Speaker 3>What happens to that food?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is that stuff out of that food by</v>

3555
02:51:19.871 --> 02:51:20.704
<v Speaker 3>the time you eat it?</v>

3556
02:51:20.940 --> 02:51:23.050
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

3557
02:51:23.170 --> 02:51:24.410
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3558
02:51:24.730 --> 02:51:28.450
<v Speaker 2>when</v>
<v Speaker 2>it comes out in the leaves and the bugs</v>

3559
02:51:28.451 --> 02:51:30.270
<v Speaker 2>eat this shit and it blows their</v>
<v Speaker 2>stomach,</v>

3560
02:51:30.320 --> 02:51:30.500
<v Speaker 2>there's a</v>

3561
02:51:30.500 --> 02:51:32.390
<v Speaker 3>great documentary on it called what's</v>
<v Speaker 3>with wheat,</v>

3562
02:51:32.450 --> 02:51:36.830
<v Speaker 3>where they try to break down why wheat</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the sudden became a huge problem in</v>

3563
02:51:36.831 --> 02:51:39.560
<v Speaker 3>the American diet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whereas in the early 19 hundreds it was</v>

3564
02:51:39.561 --> 02:51:42.420
<v Speaker 3>nothing and it was a slow genetic</v>
<v Speaker 3>modification where they.</v>

3565
02:51:42.860 --> 02:51:47.860
<v Speaker 3>They started changing the weed itself</v>
<v Speaker 3>and breeding it to make higher yields,</v>

3566
02:51:48.050 --> 02:51:50.900
<v Speaker 3>so it's got more complex gluten's in it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then on top of that,</v>

3567
02:51:50.901 --> 02:51:55.130
<v Speaker 3>it's the glyphosate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The glyphosate breaks down your gut</v>

3568
02:51:55.131 --> 02:52:00.131
<v Speaker 3>barrier and people get leaky gut and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>rest of the yeah buts it kills the</v>

3569
02:52:01.011 --> 02:52:01.821
<v Speaker 3>bacteria.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3570
02:52:01.821 --> 02:52:03.860
<v Speaker 3>this is what they're trying to do that</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to kill bacteria,</v>

3571
02:52:04.040 --> 02:52:06.100
<v Speaker 3>but they don't realize your made out</v>

3572
02:52:06.100 --> 02:52:08.770
<v Speaker 1>of bacteria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your body's an ecosystem of bacteria,</v>

3573
02:52:08.790 --> 02:52:09.670
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3574
02:52:09.700 --> 02:52:14.700
<v Speaker 1>That's just the problem with the whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>government is evil thing is they're just</v>

3575
02:52:14.921 --> 02:52:18.280
<v Speaker 1>greedy or evil because they're greeting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3576
02:52:18.281 --> 02:52:19.114
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3577
02:52:19.660 --> 02:52:21.930
<v Speaker 2>Thing and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you saw the world according to</v>

3578
02:52:21.931 --> 02:52:24.870
<v Speaker 2>Monsanto and it's this revolving door</v>
<v Speaker 2>policy.</v>

3579
02:52:24.871 --> 02:52:29.460
<v Speaker 2>How they come at a massage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Monsanto or even what he was doing,</v>

3580
02:52:29.461 --> 02:52:31.740
<v Speaker 2>Rumsfeld,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he was the CEO of Searle.</v>

3581
02:52:31.741 --> 02:52:33.480
<v Speaker 2>And then so they get into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>government,</v>

3582
02:52:33.481 --> 02:52:37.800
<v Speaker 2>they pass legislation and they go back</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the corporations to reap the benefits</v>

3583
02:52:37.801 --> 02:52:41.250
<v Speaker 2>of the laws that they passed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a lot of that going on.</v>

3584
02:52:41.730 --> 02:52:43.740
<v Speaker 2>So I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3585
02:52:43.920 --> 02:52:48.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether or not she could really be what</v>

3586
02:52:48.001 --> 02:52:51.870
<v Speaker 2>the fuck motherfuckers is saying it is</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Hawaii or anywhere else and the truth</v>

3587
02:52:51.871 --> 02:52:55.110
<v Speaker 2>is going to possibly come out eventually</v>
<v Speaker 2>or maybe not,</v>

3588
02:52:55.440 --> 02:53:00.440
<v Speaker 2>but me personally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tend to try to stick to locally farmed</v>

3589
02:53:02.820 --> 02:53:06.150
<v Speaker 2>organic like I go to the farm is mark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you get it in New York?</v>

3590
02:53:06.290 --> 02:53:09.280
<v Speaker 2>This farmer's market from upstate and</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3591
02:53:09.281 --> 02:53:10.320
<v Speaker 2>they could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They come up,</v>

3592
02:53:10.770 --> 02:53:12.060
<v Speaker 2>they come into the city.</v>

3593
02:53:12.120 --> 02:53:13.430
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm,</v>

3594
02:53:13.550 --> 02:53:18.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go to a health food store and eat shit</v>

3595
02:53:18.720 --> 02:53:23.720
<v Speaker 2>that's out of season because I like my</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking Broccoli and Kale or whatever</v>

3596
02:53:24.181 --> 02:53:27.600
<v Speaker 2>the fuck and some fruit or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

3597
02:53:28.020 --> 02:53:29.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do they grow that stuff,</v>

3598
02:53:30.200 --> 02:53:33.300
<v Speaker 2>shipped it shipped in from Cali.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in Florida,</v>

3599
02:53:33.301 --> 02:53:33.871
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3600
02:53:33.871 --> 02:53:35.220
<v Speaker 2>it's not the best,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but hey,</v>

3601
02:53:35.490 --> 02:53:39.710
<v Speaker 2>when you take into equation the fact</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I've eliminated this,</v>

3602
02:53:39.810 --> 02:53:42.990
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other foods that used the highest</v>

3603
02:53:42.991 --> 02:53:45.940
<v Speaker 2>amount of fossil fuels to grow the crops</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3604
02:53:45.941 --> 02:53:49.440
<v Speaker 2>and everything else that's involved with</v>
<v Speaker 2>producing the,</v>

3605
02:53:49.490 --> 02:53:51.630
<v Speaker 2>a huge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3606
02:53:51.720 --> 02:53:53.280
<v Speaker 2>these farms that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are,</v>

3607
02:53:53.460 --> 02:53:56.640
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these animal agriculture system than the</v>

3608
02:53:56.641 --> 02:53:58.680
<v Speaker 2>amount of fossil fuels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3609
02:53:58.681 --> 02:54:02.030
<v Speaker 2>I had motherfuckers writing me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you take a fucking plane and go on tour.</v>

3610
02:54:02.040 --> 02:54:04.650
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the thing we were talking about</v>

3611
02:54:04.660 --> 02:54:07.380
<v Speaker 2>earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fault every fucking thing,</v>

3612
02:54:07.770 --> 02:54:08.461
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

3613
02:54:08.461 --> 02:54:10.480
<v Speaker 2>but a true though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all do.</v>

3614
02:54:10.620 --> 02:54:12.250
<v Speaker 2>Do you sda both</v>

3615
02:54:12.700 --> 02:54:14.860
<v Speaker 1>poisoned sky a little bit when we fly.</v>

3616
02:54:15.340 --> 02:54:16.330
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

3617
02:54:16.331 --> 02:54:18.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll take,</v>

3618
02:54:18.450 --> 02:54:19.570
<v Speaker 2>I'll take the hit man.</v>

3619
02:54:20.040 --> 02:54:23.580
<v Speaker 1>We live in a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's one of the things they</v>

3620
02:54:23.581 --> 02:54:27.510
<v Speaker 1>found after September 11th with the lack</v>
<v Speaker 1>of plane flights changed the Earth's</v>

3621
02:54:27.511 --> 02:54:28.650
<v Speaker 1>temperature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3622
02:54:28.651 --> 02:54:30.120
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3623
02:54:30.220 --> 02:54:32.990
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

3624
02:54:33.010 --> 02:54:35.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The also the cloud cover that's created</v>

3625
02:54:35.581 --> 02:54:38.940
<v Speaker 1>by contracts like that cools the earth</v>
<v Speaker 1>down a little bit.</v>

3626
02:54:39.240 --> 02:54:41.640
<v Speaker 1>It's very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've admitted to it.</v>

3627
02:54:41.690 --> 02:54:46.690
<v Speaker 2>The government has actually admitted to</v>
<v Speaker 2>a program to try to sprain shit,</v>

3628
02:54:46.731 --> 02:54:47.564
<v Speaker 2>to try to</v>

3629
02:54:47.920 --> 02:54:52.600
<v Speaker 1>cool the earth's well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've admitted to experimented with</v>

3630
02:54:52.601 --> 02:54:56.890
<v Speaker 1>weather manipulation and to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to having strategies for dealing with</v>

3631
02:54:56.891 --> 02:54:59.740
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it is for dealing with hostile</v>

3632
02:54:59.741 --> 02:55:03.980
<v Speaker 1>foreign governments where trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>starve them out or trying to put</v>

3633
02:55:03.980 --> 02:55:06.230
<v Speaker 3>rain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they've been around forever.</v>

3634
02:55:06.670 --> 02:55:09.020
<v Speaker 2>We have a space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you see the fucking video?</v>

3635
02:55:09.021 --> 02:55:12.080
<v Speaker 2>Hey guys made on space for now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>

3636
02:55:12.170 --> 02:55:14.360
<v Speaker 2>Is it funny?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking hilarious.</v>

3637
02:55:14.361 --> 02:55:15.021
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

3638
02:55:15.021 --> 02:55:16.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's on youtube.</v>

3639
02:55:17.030 --> 02:55:19.600
<v Speaker 2>The spool on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on trump's space.</v>

3640
02:55:20.440 --> 02:55:22.940
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But here's the thing.</v>

3641
02:55:22.970 --> 02:55:27.580
<v Speaker 2>It's like China repair is trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>patch a shotgun wound with a bandaid.</v>

3642
02:55:27.590 --> 02:55:32.360
<v Speaker 2>Like let's reduce the fossil fuel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you want to fucking cool the earth</v>

3643
02:55:32.361 --> 02:55:36.050
<v Speaker 2>and everything and save the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>oceans and all the rest of this shit.</v>

3644
02:55:36.051 --> 02:55:40.730
<v Speaker 2>It's why don't we check how the fuck we</v>
<v Speaker 2>live our lives.</v>

3645
02:55:40.731 --> 02:55:43.340
<v Speaker 2>But everybody wants to pass the buck and</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

3646
02:55:43.790 --> 02:55:45.980
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well why should I do it?</v>

3647
02:55:45.981 --> 02:55:47.690
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let the next motherfucker do it.</v>

3648
02:55:47.691 --> 02:55:51.620
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you buy what you put in your car and how</v>

3649
02:55:51.621 --> 02:55:54.950
<v Speaker 2>you live your life and you have fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many people in America?</v>

3650
02:55:54.951 --> 02:55:56.060
<v Speaker 2>$200.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many?</v>

3651
02:55:56.090 --> 02:55:57.170
<v Speaker 2>Three hundred million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>$300.</v>

3652
02:55:57.171 --> 02:55:59.690
<v Speaker 2>Fucking million motherfuckers passing</v>
<v Speaker 2>the buck along.</v>

3653
02:55:59.691 --> 02:56:04.490
<v Speaker 2>You're not getting anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And China's how many billion in India?</v>

3654
02:56:04.491 --> 02:56:08.420
<v Speaker 2>And it's like they're not fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to stop fucking doing</v>

3655
02:56:08.421 --> 02:56:09.250
<v Speaker 2>what they're doing.</v>

3656
02:56:09.250 --> 02:56:10.390
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no they're not.</v>

3657
02:56:10.420 --> 02:56:14.440
<v Speaker 3>And it's again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like what we were talking about</v>

3658
02:56:14.441 --> 02:56:17.200
<v Speaker 3>with all the other aspects of gigantic</v>
<v Speaker 3>culture.</v>

3659
02:56:17.201 --> 02:56:19.570
<v Speaker 3>There's so many moving pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so,</v>

3660
02:56:19.840 --> 02:56:22.780
<v Speaker 3>it's so difficult because we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about these pieces that</v>

3661
02:56:22.781 --> 02:56:27.230
<v Speaker 3>have been in place for decades and so to</v>
<v Speaker 3>try to make corrections now and you</v>

3662
02:56:27.231 --> 02:56:28.360
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and some people are,</v>

3663
02:56:28.361 --> 02:56:32.920
<v Speaker 3>they are going to organic farms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are going to raising their own food</v>

3664
02:56:32.921 --> 02:56:34.020
<v Speaker 3>and having it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3665
02:56:34.090 --> 02:56:36.730
<v Speaker 3>having everything be local.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's definitely better.</v>

3666
02:56:36.970 --> 02:56:40.150
<v Speaker 3>But the real problem it seems to me is</v>
<v Speaker 3>overpopulation.</v>

3667
02:56:40.210 --> 02:56:43.180
<v Speaker 3>And the real problem is when you jam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3668
02:56:43.181 --> 02:56:47.530
<v Speaker 3>Los Angeles is a perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's 200 million people just here in</v>

3669
02:56:47.690 --> 02:56:49.780
<v Speaker 3>it just to get a million,</v>
<v Speaker 3>excuse me,</v>

3670
02:56:49.781 --> 02:56:51.260
<v Speaker 3>20 million,</v>
<v Speaker 3>20 million people.</v>

3671
02:56:52.770 --> 02:56:55.720
<v Speaker 3>That's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>20 million people just here and then</v>

3672
02:56:55.721 --> 02:56:57.280
<v Speaker 3>there's Orange County which has more</v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

3673
02:56:57.281 --> 02:57:01.780
<v Speaker 3>San Diego has more people as you get</v>
<v Speaker 3>north of people in San Francisco because</v>

3674
02:57:01.781 --> 02:57:04.350
<v Speaker 3>we got like morning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He people fucking millionaire.</v>

3675
02:57:04.351 --> 02:57:07.450
<v Speaker 3>There's more people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's more people in California just</v>

3676
02:57:07.451 --> 02:57:08.620
<v Speaker 3>in Santa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just in La.</v>

3677
02:57:08.621 --> 02:57:11.530
<v Speaker 3>The more people in Los Angeles than</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is in all of Australia.</v>

3678
02:57:12.790 --> 02:57:17.500
<v Speaker 3>Just all just insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's so many people and no one's</v>

3679
02:57:17.501 --> 02:57:21.160
<v Speaker 3>grown anything other than we just weeds</v>
<v Speaker 3>being grown here and that's it.</v>

3680
02:57:21.340 --> 02:57:24.970
<v Speaker 3>So all the food is being shipped in from</v>
<v Speaker 3>everywhere else and so you've got fossil</v>

3681
02:57:24.971 --> 02:57:26.810
<v Speaker 3>fuels being used and then</v>

3682
02:57:28.270 --> 02:57:31.150
<v Speaker 2>you pay more in Hawaii for a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>pineapple.</v>

3683
02:57:31.151 --> 02:57:33.190
<v Speaker 2>Then you do on the mainland.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That crazy dude.</v>

3684
02:57:33.191 --> 02:57:35.230
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You haven't been there.</v>

3685
02:57:35.231 --> 02:57:36.560
<v Speaker 2>How expensive for cat food?</v>

3686
02:57:36.850 --> 02:57:38.950
<v Speaker 3>Everything's very expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking insane.</v>

3687
02:57:39.340 --> 02:57:41.530
<v Speaker 3>It's a beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>beautiful place though and that's why</v>

3688
02:57:41.531 --> 02:57:43.430
<v Speaker 3>people are willing to take that hit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We.</v>

3689
02:57:43.610 --> 02:57:48.610
<v Speaker 3>We live in a place that humans like</v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself and myself and people that are</v>

3690
02:57:49.721 --> 02:57:53.020
<v Speaker 3>alive today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are stuck in a system that was</v>

3691
02:57:53.021 --> 02:57:54.670
<v Speaker 3>created many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many decades ago.</v>

3692
02:57:54.700 --> 02:57:58.540
<v Speaker 3>It was put into place many decades ago</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it wasn't put into place with our</v>

3693
02:57:58.541 --> 02:58:00.970
<v Speaker 3>interests in mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was put into place with the interest</v>

3694
02:58:01.050 --> 02:58:04.140
<v Speaker 3>mind a profit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was also to deal with the,</v>

3695
02:58:04.320 --> 02:58:07.620
<v Speaker 3>to accommodate millions and millions of</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that are all jammed into one</v>

3696
02:58:07.621 --> 02:58:11.190
<v Speaker 3>place where no one's growing any food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very unnatural way to live.</v>

3697
02:58:11.190 --> 02:58:13.410
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they started coming down on all the</v>

3698
02:58:13.411 --> 02:58:18.411
<v Speaker 2>people fucking growing a shade on their</v>
<v Speaker 2>front lawns and yards now because urban</v>

3699
02:58:19.081 --> 02:58:21.140
<v Speaker 2>organic farm into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3700
02:58:21.141 --> 02:58:23.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in touch with a lot of those people.</v>

3701
02:58:23.200 --> 02:58:24.610
<v Speaker 2>As a matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's one in,</v>

3702
02:58:24.630 --> 02:58:29.010
<v Speaker 2>in New York City I ride from New York</v>
<v Speaker 2>city out to like Long Island Jones beach</v>

3703
02:58:29.011 --> 02:58:32.320
<v Speaker 2>and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I pass in far rockaway.</v>

3704
02:58:32.321 --> 02:58:36.840
<v Speaker 2>It is a guy that he's doing like a big</v>
<v Speaker 2>urban farm.</v>

3705
02:58:36.841 --> 02:58:39.900
<v Speaker 2>The in this thing and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this crop of land,</v>

3706
02:58:40.590 --> 02:58:41.790
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3707
02:58:42.140 --> 02:58:47.140
<v Speaker 2>it's the urban farming is becoming a big</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing because if I it the food desert</v>

3708
02:58:47.970 --> 02:58:50.580
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there was one guy on abc and he</v>

3709
02:58:50.581 --> 02:58:54.300
<v Speaker 2>walked home from work every night and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was five miles African American guy and</v>

3710
02:58:54.301 --> 02:58:55.920
<v Speaker 2>he's trying to lose weight and get</v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy.</v>

3711
02:58:56.100 --> 02:58:56.933
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guess what?</v>

3712
02:58:57.000 --> 02:58:59.970
<v Speaker 2>Every motherfucking night all he passed</v>
<v Speaker 2>was KFC.</v>

3713
02:59:00.120 --> 02:59:00.661
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

3714
02:59:00.661 --> 02:59:01.740
<v Speaker 2>the other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>7:11.</v>

3715
02:59:01.830 --> 02:59:06.830
<v Speaker 2>He could not buy a fucking piece of</v>
<v Speaker 2>fruit or a fucking apple in any of those</v>

3716
02:59:06.931 --> 02:59:08.250
<v Speaker 2>fucking places.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None.</v>

3717
02:59:08.610 --> 02:59:10.080
<v Speaker 2>So then they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3718
02:59:10.081 --> 02:59:12.830
<v Speaker 2>how the fuck are we going to get food if</v>
<v Speaker 2>we ain't got no car,</v>

3719
02:59:12.850 --> 02:59:17.010
<v Speaker 2>we can go seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 miles out of town to the supermarket.</v>

3720
02:59:17.190 --> 02:59:20.250
<v Speaker 2>So now urban,</v>
<v Speaker 2>organic farming is becoming a big thing</v>

3721
02:59:20.251 --> 02:59:23.240
<v Speaker 2>where they're showing these pen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now they're starting to crack down.</v>

3722
02:59:23.250 --> 02:59:27.890
<v Speaker 2>The cities are trying to crack down on</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people that are growing fucking</v>

3723
02:59:27.900 --> 02:59:29.180
<v Speaker 2>food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's ridiculous.</v>

3724
02:59:29.600 --> 02:59:32.000
<v Speaker 3>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had Ron Finley on this podcast and</v>

3725
02:59:32.001 --> 02:59:34.670
<v Speaker 3>he's got a similar program in south</v>
<v Speaker 3>central and uh,</v>

3726
02:59:34.730 --> 02:59:39.440
<v Speaker 3>he helps these kids and people that live</v>
<v Speaker 3>there use vacant lots.</v>

3727
02:59:39.470 --> 02:59:43.120
<v Speaker 3>Use Medians in Detroit too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3728
02:59:43.121 --> 02:59:44.390
<v Speaker 3>it's fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3729
02:59:44.450 --> 02:59:46.490
<v Speaker 3>Grow food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got all fucking fruit.</v>

3730
02:59:46.520 --> 02:59:48.080
<v Speaker 3>Food would be free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Grow it,</v>

3731
02:59:48.081 --> 02:59:49.280
<v Speaker 3>grow it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Patches of land.</v>

3732
02:59:49.281 --> 02:59:52.190
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would be ideal is if every</v>

3733
02:59:52.191 --> 02:59:54.920
<v Speaker 3>community,</v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of just having a house jam next</v>

3734
02:59:54.921 --> 02:59:56.150
<v Speaker 3>to a house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gym next to a house,</v>

3735
02:59:56.300 --> 03:00:00.110
<v Speaker 3>every community have one community lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that community lot.</v>

3736
03:00:00.111 --> 03:00:01.220
<v Speaker 3>We all grow our food in,</v>

3737
03:00:01.290 --> 03:00:02.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not hard to do.</v>

3738
03:00:02.490 --> 03:00:06.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean even in a fucking closet did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>showing how to do like they just had</v>

3739
03:00:06.901 --> 03:00:10.350
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had a shipping container in New</v>

3740
03:00:10.350 --> 03:00:15.350
<v Speaker 2>York and it was a demonstration and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>put it on a Lafayette and Lafayette</v>

3741
03:00:15.510 --> 03:00:19.170
<v Speaker 2>Street and Houseton and it was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>shipping container and they did all.</v>

3742
03:00:19.171 --> 03:00:23.610
<v Speaker 2>And when you walked in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a fucking farm and I forget how</v>

3743
03:00:23.611 --> 03:00:27.480
<v Speaker 2>many thousand pounds of organic produce</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

3744
03:00:27.481 --> 03:00:31.920
<v Speaker 2>that fucking farm inside that shipping</v>
<v Speaker 2>container was able to grow.</v>

3745
03:00:32.280 --> 03:00:33.690
<v Speaker 2>But it's insane.</v>

3746
03:00:34.160 --> 03:00:35.820
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the artificial light.</v>

3747
03:00:35.821 --> 03:00:40.740
<v Speaker 3>But you could do that with real life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the real streets that you see everywhere</v>

3748
03:00:40.741 --> 03:00:42.520
<v Speaker 3>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

3749
03:00:42.600 --> 03:00:46.440
<v Speaker 3>where concrete is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could be dirt and then it is possible</v>

3750
03:00:46.441 --> 03:00:51.240
<v Speaker 3>that we could cordon off a small section</v>
<v Speaker 3>of every community and have a community</v>

3751
03:00:51.241 --> 03:00:54.960
<v Speaker 3>garden and it would also be a good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would be good for the community in</v>

3752
03:00:54.961 --> 03:00:58.920
<v Speaker 3>terms of people interacting with each</v>
<v Speaker 3>other and feeling like they're a part of</v>

3753
03:00:58.930 --> 03:01:02.710
<v Speaker 3>something and taking responsibility for</v>
<v Speaker 3>taking care of.</v>

3754
03:01:02.880 --> 03:01:04.850
<v Speaker 2>Get your hands in the dirt too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3755
03:01:05.030 --> 03:01:06.460
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3756
03:01:06.510 --> 03:01:07.830
<v Speaker 2>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3757
03:01:07.831 --> 03:01:10.680
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the programs that we did</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this documentary.</v>

3758
03:01:10.681 --> 03:01:14.970
<v Speaker 2>We added a guy's going to fall organic</v>
<v Speaker 2>farms and getting their hands in the</v>

3759
03:01:14.971 --> 03:01:16.410
<v Speaker 2>dirt and seeing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3760
03:01:16.620 --> 03:01:19.080
<v Speaker 2>people just as a disconnect between</v>

<v Speaker 2>Fucking hard man.</v>

3765
03:01:27.930 --> 03:01:32.070

<v Speaker 2>And I think who was the,</v>

<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

<v Speaker 3>approved or film of Kennedy being</v>
<v Speaker 3>assassinated.</v>

3773
03:01:52.600 --> 03:01:54.340
<v Speaker 3>It looks like he's being shot from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>front.</v>

3774
03:01:54.370 --> 03:01:55.660
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3775
03:01:55.720 --> 03:01:59.220
<v Speaker 3>Dick Gregory brought that to the Geraldo</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rivera show.</v>

3776
03:01:59.320 --> 03:02:01.990
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Years after the assassination.</v>

3777
03:02:01.991 --> 03:02:03.670
<v Speaker 3>It might've been more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>More than eight.</v>

3778
03:02:03.970 --> 03:02:06.190
<v Speaker 3>Might have been more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Know a lot of shit.</v>

3779
03:02:06.250 --> 03:02:07.083
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

3780
03:02:07.570 --> 03:02:09.790
<v Speaker 3>it might've been 10 years after the</v>
<v Speaker 3>assassin.</v>

3781
03:02:09.850 --> 03:02:11.560
<v Speaker 3>Something crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it didn't.</v>

3782
03:02:11.770 --> 03:02:15.430
<v Speaker 3>People didn't see Kennedy get</v>
<v Speaker 3>assassinated until many,</v>

3783
03:02:15.431 --> 03:02:18.160
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many years after when this guy's</v>

3784
03:02:18.161 --> 03:02:21.130
<v Speaker 3>approved or who was there on the spot</v>
<v Speaker 3>was filming.</v>

3785
03:02:21.280 --> 03:02:24.970
<v Speaker 3>They took his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his film and he sold it to time life</v>

3786
03:02:24.971 --> 03:02:28.270
<v Speaker 3>magazine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They use stills of it and then they</v>

3787
03:02:28.271 --> 03:02:29.240
<v Speaker 3>didn't show it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

3788
03:02:29.650 --> 03:02:31.840
<v Speaker 3>12 years?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Twelve years later.</v>

3789
03:02:31.900 --> 03:02:33.140
<v Speaker 3>Seventy five.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

3790
03:02:33.170 --> 03:02:35.410
<v Speaker 3>So on 75 and the Geraldo Rivera show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

3791
03:02:35.510 --> 03:02:40.030
<v Speaker 3>they premiered the Zapruder film footage</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the assassination of President</v>

3792
03:02:40.031 --> 03:02:43.270
<v Speaker 3>Kennedy from like fucking 20 yards away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was right.</v>

3793
03:02:43.290 --> 03:02:46.390
<v Speaker 3>That NDC Kennedy's head go back into the</v>
<v Speaker 3>left.</v>

3794
03:02:46.560 --> 03:02:48.730
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see the spray of blood and you're</v>

3795
03:02:48.731 --> 03:02:49.550
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

3796
03:02:49.550 --> 03:02:52.330
<v Speaker 2>So was it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did they show that it was more than one?</v>

3797
03:02:53.090 --> 03:02:56.750
<v Speaker 3>They can't tell for sure and there's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of speculation because there's so</v>

3798
03:02:56.751 --> 03:03:00.050
<v Speaker 3>many men in black and white and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>were shaky back then.</v>

3799
03:03:00.051 --> 03:03:03.170
<v Speaker 3>They've since use computers to stabilize</v>
<v Speaker 3>the image,</v>

3800
03:03:03.560 --> 03:03:08.560
<v Speaker 3>but what it looks like to the untrained</v>
<v Speaker 3>eye is that he shot more than once and</v>

3801
03:03:09.201 --> 03:03:12.410
<v Speaker 3>probably shot from multiple different</v>
<v Speaker 3>angles and the reason why they came up</v>

3802
03:03:12.411 --> 03:03:14.380
<v Speaker 3>with the magic bullet theory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they account,</v>

3803
03:03:14.540 --> 03:03:17.960
<v Speaker 3>they had to account for another bullet</v>
<v Speaker 3>that didn't hit the president.</v>

3804
03:03:18.200 --> 03:03:22.360
<v Speaker 3>They had to account for a bullet that</v>
<v Speaker 3>hit it ricocheted under an underpass and</v>

3805
03:03:22.490 --> 03:03:23.840
<v Speaker 3>hit a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

3806
03:03:23.841 --> 03:03:28.841
<v Speaker 3>the bullet had to go through to people</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it had a leave traces of the bullet</v>

3807
03:03:28.851 --> 03:03:31.700
<v Speaker 3>behind that weren't missing for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>bullet from the book.</v>

3808
03:03:31.850 --> 03:03:34.250
<v Speaker 3>And it had a shattered bone and not</v>
<v Speaker 3>distort.</v>

3809
03:03:34.490 --> 03:03:35.670
<v Speaker 3>Which doesn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3810
03:03:35.870 --> 03:03:38.390
<v Speaker 3>If you know anything about bullets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you shoot anything,</v>

3811
03:03:38.780 --> 03:03:40.130
<v Speaker 3>bullets get Jack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get,</v>

3812
03:03:40.190 --> 03:03:41.470
<v Speaker 3>they tear up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

3813
03:03:41.510 --> 03:03:42.620
<v Speaker 3>they been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get,</v>

3814
03:03:42.650 --> 03:03:43.650
<v Speaker 3>they get sleep.</v>

3815
03:03:43.830 --> 03:03:45.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could take fucking lead.</v>

3816
03:03:45.550 --> 03:03:46.450
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3817
03:03:46.451 --> 03:03:48.520
<v Speaker 3>Even if it's jacketed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's still going to get fucked up.</v>

3818
03:03:48.521 --> 03:03:51.370
<v Speaker 3>It's hitting bones and shattering at a</v>
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous speed.</v>

3819
03:03:51.730 --> 03:03:55.060
<v Speaker 3>The single bullet theory was also</v>
<v Speaker 3>created by Arlen Specter and those</v>

3820
03:03:55.061 --> 03:03:56.850
<v Speaker 3>fucking guys from the Warren Commission</v>
<v Speaker 3>report,</v>

3821
03:03:57.050 --> 03:03:58.550
<v Speaker 3>bunch of evil assets</v>

3822
03:03:58.880 --> 03:04:02.420
<v Speaker 1>is a great book on it called a best</v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence by David Lifton.</v>

3823
03:04:02.450 --> 03:04:06.530
<v Speaker 1>David Lipton was an accountant who went</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the Warren Commission report step</v>

3824
03:04:06.531 --> 03:04:09.710
<v Speaker 1>by step every step of the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she found all these contradictions</v>

3825
03:04:09.980 --> 03:04:13.400
<v Speaker 1>in the reporting like this is a bullshit</v>
<v Speaker 1>document like when they were trying to</v>

3826
03:04:13.401 --> 03:04:16.190
<v Speaker 1>do was just wrapped this bitch up nice</v>
<v Speaker 1>and tight.</v>

3827
03:04:16.191 --> 03:04:19.520
<v Speaker 1>They weren't trying to solve the crime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were trying to wrap this thing up</v>

3828
03:04:19.521 --> 03:04:23.240
<v Speaker 1>tight and the most ridiculous aspect of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is the magic bullet theory,</v>

3829
03:04:23.540 --> 03:04:25.550
<v Speaker 1>but before anybody saw this uproot or</v>
<v Speaker 1>film,</v>

3830
03:04:25.551 --> 03:04:28.490
<v Speaker 1>it didn't look that ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We heard what we were told.</v>

3831
03:04:28.700 --> 03:04:32.720
<v Speaker 1>Kennedy got shot by Oswald and Jack Ruby</v>
<v Speaker 1>shot ours walled.</v>

3832
03:04:33.100 --> 03:04:34.910
<v Speaker 1>Very convenient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very convenient.</v>

3833
03:04:35.060 --> 03:04:37.880
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why they killed them,</v>

3834
03:04:38.210 --> 03:04:42.230
<v Speaker 1>but it's very likely that there was</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite a few people involved and not just</v>

3835
03:04:42.231 --> 03:04:43.810
<v Speaker 1>Lee Harvey Oswald,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was probably involved.</v>

3836
03:04:44.170 --> 03:04:44.681
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3837
03:04:44.681 --> 03:04:49.681
<v Speaker 2>that he passed a resolution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was fucking with the Federal Reserve.</v>

3838
03:04:49.960 --> 03:04:52.510
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the,</v>

3839
03:04:52.511 --> 03:04:54.310
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one one one.</v>

3840
03:04:54.550 --> 03:04:55.460
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a.</v>

3841
03:04:56.070 --> 03:04:57.070
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of problems.</v>

3842
03:04:57.110 --> 03:04:58.090
<v Speaker 2>They have pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

3843
03:04:58.091 --> 03:04:58.690
<v Speaker 2>a pig.</v>

3844
03:04:58.690 --> 03:04:59.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a,</v>

3845
03:04:59.480 --> 03:05:02.110
<v Speaker 1>he wanted to get rid of the Federal</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reserve.</v>

3846
03:05:02.111 --> 03:05:04.040
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to get rid of the CIA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Started printing.</v>

3847
03:05:04.130 --> 03:05:07.080
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A currency backed by.</v>

3848
03:05:07.140 --> 03:05:10.020
<v Speaker 2>He wanted to go back to the gold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>silver standard.</v>

3849
03:05:10.021 --> 03:05:14.100
<v Speaker 2>He started printing up notes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking if you could find those notes</v>

3850
03:05:14.101 --> 03:05:17.250
<v Speaker 2>from when he was in silver certificates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

3851
03:05:17.251 --> 03:05:20.130
<v Speaker 2>why a private banks controlling our</v>
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>

3852
03:05:20.131 --> 03:05:22.530
<v Speaker 2>the Federal Reserve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't,</v>

3853
03:05:22.531 --> 03:05:24.720
<v Speaker 2>I think one of the acts that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3854
03:05:24.860 --> 03:05:27.660
<v Speaker 2>George Bush junior passed before he</v>
<v Speaker 2>left,</v>

3855
03:05:27.661 --> 03:05:32.400
<v Speaker 2>or this executive order on one one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one zero to give him the printing of the</v>

3856
03:05:32.401 --> 03:05:36.750
<v Speaker 2>money back to the fucking take it away</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the Federal Reserve.</v>

3857
03:05:36.850 --> 03:05:40.380
<v Speaker 2>They whacked him just a couple of months</v>
<v Speaker 2>later and give it back to the secretary.</v>

3858
03:05:40.470 --> 03:05:42.990
<v Speaker 2>His father said that they're going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>kill you for this.</v>

3859
03:05:43.620 --> 03:05:46.530
<v Speaker 2>His father told him that you fuck with</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

3860
03:05:46.531 --> 03:05:47.460
<v Speaker 2>Bankers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3861
03:05:47.550 --> 03:05:48.860
<v Speaker 2>True.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's uh,</v>

3862
03:05:48.870 --> 03:05:50.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes back to,</v>

3863
03:05:50.370 --> 03:05:51.203
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3864
03:05:51.210 --> 03:05:54.990
<v Speaker 2>power is not about a conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about Yo.</v>

3865
03:05:55.320 --> 03:05:58.170
<v Speaker 2>It's about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want the ultimate greed.</v>

3866
03:05:58.200 --> 03:06:01.290
<v Speaker 2>It's the ultimate greed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We control everything.</v>

3867
03:06:01.320 --> 03:06:02.160
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially back then</v>

3868
03:06:02.190 --> 03:06:03.200
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3869
03:06:03.210 --> 03:06:07.200
<v Speaker 1>the amount of accountability that</v>
<v Speaker 1>politicians had back then you can get</v>

<v Speaker 2>punk rock shows.</v>

4186
03:20:41.901 --> 03:20:45.730

<v Speaker 2>famous murder spots.</v>

4187
03:20:46.150 --> 03:20:49.480

<v Speaker 2>East village butcher,</v>

4188
03:20:49.481 --> 03:20:51.160
<v Speaker 2>Daniel Rakowitz.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He chopped up,</v>

4189
03:20:51.161 --> 03:20:54.280
<v Speaker 2>his girlfriend made soup out of her and</v>
<v Speaker 2>fed it to the homeless.</v>

4190
03:20:54.280 --> 03:20:55.650
<v Speaker 2>I lived in that building.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I squatted in that building.</v>

4192
03:20:59.290 --> 03:21:01.570
