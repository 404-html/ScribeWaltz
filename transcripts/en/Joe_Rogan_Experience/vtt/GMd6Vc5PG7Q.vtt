<v Speaker 1>the robots attacking the people.</v>

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.550
<v Speaker 1>It started in Tempe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arizona.</v>

3
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.200
<v Speaker 1>Someone's killed by a self driving uber.</v>

4
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.990
<v Speaker 1>Put the self driving ubers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not ready for this yet.</v>

5
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.720
<v Speaker 1>No chance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not ready to die.</v>

6
00:00:20.721 --> 00:00:25.721
<v Speaker 1>I'm not ready for planes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should have those things on a </v>

7
00:00:25.721 --> 00:00:25.721
<v Speaker 1>closed course over a long period of </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

8
00:00:25.721 --> 00:00:28.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then let them drive around cities.</v>

9
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got to build some trust.</v>

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

11
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trusting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got to have some obstacle courses.</v>

12
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.210
<v Speaker 1>Self-Driving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uber Kills Arizona pedestrian as all as </v>

13
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:38.940
<v Speaker 1>cops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is hilarious.</v>

14
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.740
<v Speaker 1>Is that an uber car?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A cop car?</v>

15
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.810
<v Speaker 1>Uber's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They look like cop cars.</v>

16
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.700
<v Speaker 1>What's the thing on the roof?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

17
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.440
<v Speaker 1>the camera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It lets it drive fencers,</v>

18
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:48.810
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck all that.</v>

19
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.810
<v Speaker 1>Not to say that a guy couldn't have done</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

20
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.450
<v Speaker 1>And not to say that this person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoever it was,</v>

21
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.920
<v Speaker 1>who knows what the circumstances were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes accidents are unavoidable,</v>

22
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.950
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are certain times where </v>

23
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.950
<v Speaker 1>someone makes an error.</v>

24
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.100
<v Speaker 1>We don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just feel better if it's a person </v>

25
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.890
<v Speaker 1>making an error for some strange reason </v>
<v Speaker 1>came here.</v>

26
00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.500
<v Speaker 1>I think uber and lyft would have like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>gang war.</v>

27
00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.150
<v Speaker 1>They probably would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

28
00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.070
<v Speaker 1>If you let the algorithms take over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's over.</v>

29
00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.850
<v Speaker 1>They probably fuck with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't they like the Uber Guys?</v>

30
00:01:17.851 --> 00:01:20.630
<v Speaker 1>Super aggressive as they get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't get in trouble for doing the uh,</v>

31
00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.090
<v Speaker 1>like fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

32
00:01:22.091 --> 00:01:25.150
<v Speaker 1>that's causing problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Finding a real.</v>

33
00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.040
<v Speaker 1>Is that real?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that a real story?</v>

34
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.260
<v Speaker 1>Networks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was like allegations I think </v>

35
00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.260
<v Speaker 1>because they were private getting sued,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sued each other,</v>

36
00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.540
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know if it ever came out and </v>

37
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.540
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>like making fake calls.</v>

39
00:01:36.761 --> 00:01:37.690
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it was?</v>

<v Speaker 1>You got the right idea with that.</v>

42
00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.490
<v Speaker 1>We uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just got to uber but it's only two </v>

48
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.120
<v Speaker 1>The currencies beer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the thing that was.</v>

49
00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.410
<v Speaker 1>Everyone can do everything but no one </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to work.</v>

50
00:02:05.411 --> 00:02:06.670
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>

51
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.760
<v Speaker 1>Uber's dirty tricks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quantified rival counts.</v>

52
00:02:09.761 --> 00:02:14.080
<v Speaker 1>Five thousand 560 canceled rides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's in 2014.</v>

53
00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.240
<v Speaker 1>Is that real?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's right when it started.</v>

54
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.510
<v Speaker 1>Is that definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's on CNN so it can't be fake news.</v>

55
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.360
<v Speaker 1>I've never canceled an uber.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel really bad about it.</v>

56
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.160
<v Speaker 1>About never canceling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well No.</v>

57
00:02:27.161 --> 00:02:29.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean if I canceled I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd want to like tell the guy.</v>

58
00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:30.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

59
00:02:30.851 --> 00:02:32.080

<v Speaker 1>just should be a way.</v>

60
00:02:32.081 --> 00:02:33.850
<v Speaker 1>If you have to cancel it to give the guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>a tip,</v>

61
00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.650
<v Speaker 1>that's a good move.</v>

<v Speaker 1>like say I have like super last minute </v>

<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

68
00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.140
<v Speaker 1>That's more than fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're setting them back a few minutes.</v>

69
00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.360
<v Speaker 1>You don't get anything back when they </v>

72
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.030
<v Speaker 2>Every Uber I've ever been to was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>dream.</v>

73
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.540
<v Speaker 2>I've never had a single problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you had uber x ever though?</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's the truck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

75
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.560
<v Speaker 2>that's just like random people with </v>
<v Speaker 2>cars.</v>

76
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.950
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

79
00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.060
<v Speaker 2>It's basically limo drivers that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>like off duty.</v>

80
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are awesome.</v>

81
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.150
<v Speaker 2>If you ever uber acts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can get a little dicey.</v>

82
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.390
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just with a random chick that's </v>

83
00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.390
<v Speaker 2>having a meltdown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

84
00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can imagine.</v>

85
00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:25.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's cool.</v>

86
00:03:25.421 --> 00:03:27.460
<v Speaker 2>It's not like it's a big thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's just like,</v>

87
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't pay my dsl bill this month and </v>

88
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.000
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lady,</v>

89
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm right here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very small car.</v>

90
00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.110
<v Speaker 2>This people that just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're working their life out,</v>

91
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.770
<v Speaker 2>but let's say if they're unlike a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hundred level game,</v>

92
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.310
<v Speaker 2>they're on level one and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>bouncing into the walls over and over </v>

93
00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.590
<v Speaker 2>again and they just don't seem like in </v>
<v Speaker 2>order for you to give them real advice,</v>

94
00:03:50.591 --> 00:03:52.270
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to basically move into their </v>
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>

95
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.050
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to like give a full revamp of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way they look at things.</v>

96
00:03:56.051 --> 00:03:56.800
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

97
00:03:56.801 --> 00:03:57.510
<v Speaker 2>stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

98
00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.560
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are all these pills?</v>

99
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.620
<v Speaker 2>Second of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you eating third of all?</v>

100
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.180
<v Speaker 2>Like why are you talking to people like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

101
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.520
<v Speaker 2>Like if you talk to people like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not gonna want to talk to you,</v>

102
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.200
<v Speaker 2>like you're upset that they don't like </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

103
00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.600
<v Speaker 2>but then you act in a way that's very </v>
<v Speaker 2>unpleasant to be around.</v>

104
00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.660
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you'd have to go through every </v>

105
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.970
<v Speaker 2>mistake this person's been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you'd have to find out.</v>

106
00:04:15.971 --> 00:04:18.160
<v Speaker 2>It's almost all shitty parenting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like plumbing.</v>

107
00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Back Down to the root system.</v>

108
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.980
<v Speaker 2>The roots got into the pipes or you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

109
00:04:23.981 --> 00:04:27.100
<v Speaker 2>I'll look at crack because of the earth </v>
<v Speaker 2>shifted and you're losing all this water</v>

110
00:04:27.101 --> 00:04:28.090
<v Speaker 2>down here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

111
00:04:28.091 --> 00:04:30.940
<v Speaker 2>You just start screaming when you feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>threatened at all.</v>

112
00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.650
<v Speaker 2>Like that may be a thing from your </v>
<v Speaker 2>childhood.</v>

113
00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of that out there.</v>

114
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:35.530
<v Speaker 2>There is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

115
00:04:35.531 --> 00:04:37.210
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to talk to you about social </v>
<v Speaker 2>media.</v>

116
00:04:37.211 --> 00:04:38.120
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

117
00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:40.600
<v Speaker 2>I love you too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're very good guy.</v>

118
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.630
<v Speaker 2>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you are the worst representative of </v>

119
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:46.840
<v Speaker 2>yourself on social media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a lawyer myself.</v>

120
00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.580
<v Speaker 2>It's a bad form of getting out tricky </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas.</v>

121
00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.070
<v Speaker 2>It's a bad form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just not good.</v>

122
00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:55.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean now it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is it to 80 now?</v>

123
00:04:55.751 --> 00:04:58.680
<v Speaker 2>Two hundred 80 characters is better than</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was 1:40</v>

124
00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.820
<v Speaker 2>was very rough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 1:40.</v>

125
00:05:00.821 --> 00:05:02.450
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

126
00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:03.880
<v Speaker 2>you have to really think about what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're saying.</v>

127
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.930
<v Speaker 2>So you're yelling like as you're falling</v>
<v Speaker 2>into a well you have like one sentence </v>

128
00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.200
<v Speaker 2>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are without a doubt addicted.</v>

129
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.000
<v Speaker 2>And I know you bailed on your phone for </v>
<v Speaker 2>awhile and you went to a flip flip on.</v>

130
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I see these manic tweets from you </v>

131
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.210
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to go hang out with you and </v>

132
00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:24.210
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

133
00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.791
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are you constantly tweeting and </v>

134
00:05:26.791 --> 00:05:28.750
<v Speaker 2>attacking people and it's like sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 2>the chaos helps me.</v>

135
00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:30.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right,</v>

136
00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.840
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not challenging.</v>

137
00:05:31.841 --> 00:05:36.841
<v Speaker 2>That's David,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like I see it as almost like a idea </v>

138
00:05:36.841 --> 00:05:37.030
<v Speaker 2>sonar where you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

139
00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.500
<v Speaker 2>I get that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get that,</v>

140
00:05:38.501 --> 00:05:42.190
<v Speaker 2>but I get that because I know you did a </v>
<v Speaker 2>really good dude and real life.</v>

141
00:05:42.191 --> 00:05:47.191
<v Speaker 2>Thanks man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I see this online and I see </v>

142
00:05:47.191 --> 00:05:49.930
<v Speaker 2>these blurting out post just outbreak </v>
<v Speaker 2>posts,</v>

143
00:05:49.931 --> 00:05:51.250
<v Speaker 2>they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just like,</v>

144
00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:56.710
<v Speaker 2>like you got diarrhea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean just let me see if I could throw </v>

145
00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.030
<v Speaker 2>the word nigger in here for a goof.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me see if I can say something that's</v>

146
00:05:59.031 --> 00:06:00.050
<v Speaker 2>going to piss people off.</v>

147
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:05.050
<v Speaker 2>And it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this weird thing you're doing </v>

148
00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:06.260
<v Speaker 2>like this Jessalyn next thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you just decided to attack Anthony.</v>

149
00:06:06.261 --> 00:06:07.170
<v Speaker 2>Jessalyn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you.</v>

150
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:12.250
<v Speaker 2>Did he attack?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what happened was someone said </v>

151
00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:12.950
<v Speaker 2>that a data hurt I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said I was outright,</v>

152
00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:17.980
<v Speaker 2>which is like the new people can believe</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they could believe that you were </v>

153
00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:21.791
<v Speaker 2>outright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if someone tells them it's appear </v>

154
00:06:21.791 --> 00:06:22.970
<v Speaker 2>outrageous tweets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's one or two of them,</v>

155
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.450
<v Speaker 2>they'd go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

156
00:06:23.451 --> 00:06:28.451
<v Speaker 2>this guy's an outright comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they see you with certain </v>

157
00:06:28.451 --> 00:06:29.120
<v Speaker 2>people that you've had podcast with and </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk to.</v>

158
00:06:29.121 --> 00:06:31.340
<v Speaker 2>That might also be lumped in immune </v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculously.</v>

159
00:06:31.341 --> 00:06:33.080
<v Speaker 2>So like Jordan Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they lump him into.</v>

160
00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.130
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gotcha.</v>

161
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:37.430
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make any sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they do it like I'm in luck.</v>

162
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.100
<v Speaker 2>I've had people on that people think are</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right.</v>

163
00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:42.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are fucking crazy.</v>

164
00:06:42.681 --> 00:06:46.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's people out there think </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ben Shapiro is antisemetic.</v>

165
00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:48.960
<v Speaker 2>That's how.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how I know there's no,</v>

166
00:06:48.961 --> 00:06:50.810
<v Speaker 2>there's no logic at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like right now,</v>

167
00:06:50.811 --> 00:06:55.811
<v Speaker 2>Martin Luther King Jr would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>considered outright by certain crazy </v>

168
00:06:55.811 --> 00:06:59.771
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would probably have adjusted his </v>

169
00:06:59.771 --> 00:06:59.771
<v Speaker 2>views.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't you think?</v>

170
00:06:59.771 --> 00:07:03.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean his views,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it probably changed knowing all that we </v>

171
00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:04.370
<v Speaker 2>know about people today and I mean he </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be a different person.</v>

172
00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:09.500
<v Speaker 2>You've got to think that guy growing up </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the 19 fifties and then beans into </v>

173
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:13.370
<v Speaker 2>the sixties as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most important civil rights activist</v>

174
00:07:13.371 --> 00:07:18.371
<v Speaker 2>of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was dealing with a completely </v>

175
00:07:18.371 --> 00:07:18.371
<v Speaker 2>different world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

176
00:07:18.371 --> 00:07:19.420
<v Speaker 2>There was no social media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>

177
00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:23.270
<v Speaker 2>there was not much consolidated power is</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably very difficult to get people to</v>

178
00:07:23.271 --> 00:07:26.570
<v Speaker 2>March once they start sicking dogs on </v>
<v Speaker 2>people and blowing fire hoses on them.</v>

179
00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:27.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had to be,</v>

180
00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:32.030
<v Speaker 2>you had less protection and he'd had to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be more,</v>

181
00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:37.090
<v Speaker 2>more rigid and conservative than just </v>
<v Speaker 2>because people would have to be just </v>

182
00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:38.420
<v Speaker 2>very careful if that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

183
00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:40.070
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we talked about this recently,</v>

184
00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:45.100
<v Speaker 2>I guess it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was it Danielle Lee Bailey we were </v>

185
00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:45.140
<v Speaker 2>talking about about how recently slavery</v>
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>

186
00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:46.420
<v Speaker 2>Was it him?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it Danielle might.</v>

187
00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:48.020
<v Speaker 2>Might've been either way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

188
00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:51.140
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a crazy small amount of time.</v>

189
00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:56.200
<v Speaker 2>Crazy 200 years ago and it's been </v>
<v Speaker 2>existed for like tens of thousands of </v>

190
00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:00.640
<v Speaker 2>years and that there's more slavery in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world today because there's more </v>

191
00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:00.830
<v Speaker 2>people alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of tricky.</v>

192
00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.950
<v Speaker 2>But this last percentage of people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are slaves,</v>

193
00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:07.400
<v Speaker 2>so it's kind of misleading when people </v>
<v Speaker 2>say it's more sleek slavery,</v>

194
00:08:07.401 --> 00:08:09.830
<v Speaker 2>there's way more people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good point.</v>

195
00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:11.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's more everything way,</v>

196
00:08:11.211 --> 00:08:11.840
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

197
00:08:11.841 --> 00:08:16.841
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way more people and there's way more </v>

198
00:08:16.841 --> 00:08:16.841
<v Speaker 2>crazy people and now they all have </v>
<v Speaker 2>Internet access.</v>

199
00:08:16.841 --> 00:08:21.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I was looking at this thing </v>

200
00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:23.170
<v Speaker 2>where they were trying to trace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've heard about that new species of </v>

201
00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:25.550
<v Speaker 2>human that they found,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think around somewhere in the range of</v>

202
00:08:25.551 --> 00:08:28.200
<v Speaker 2>a seven or eight years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dyno scions,</v>

203
00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:29.120
<v Speaker 2>I think they call them.</v>

204
00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:32.660
<v Speaker 2>They found them in Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what they are is,</v>

205
00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:33.230
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

206
00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:35.120
<v Speaker 2>when there was neanderthal and Homo </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sapiens,</v>

207
00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:39.170
<v Speaker 2>there was another one and then this </v>
<v Speaker 2>other one bread.</v>

208
00:08:39.171 --> 00:08:42.410
<v Speaker 2>There's apparently they think there was </v>
<v Speaker 2>many different kinds of humans.</v>

209
00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:43.400
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

210
00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:46.340
<v Speaker 2>But what the faith thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That fucking freaked me out,</v>

211
00:08:46.341 --> 00:08:49.550
<v Speaker 2>they were talking about how long ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was like 70,000</v>

212
00:08:49.551 --> 00:08:53.330
<v Speaker 2>plus years ago that they were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were talking about one era and then</v>

213
00:08:53.331 --> 00:08:55.070
<v Speaker 2>they were talking about the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that were alive then.</v>

214
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.870
<v Speaker 2>And they said something around the area </v>
<v Speaker 2>of 100,000</v>

215
00:08:57.871 --> 00:09:01.440
<v Speaker 2>humans total amount that's on the four </v>
<v Speaker 2>or five right now.</v>

216
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:03.240
<v Speaker 2>Just fuck that on the four.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

217
00:09:03.241 --> 00:09:07.140
<v Speaker 2>five between here and West Hills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably more.</v>

218
00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:12.170
<v Speaker 2>And that's why we have such a vicious </v>
<v Speaker 2>instinct because at that point it's </v>

219
00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:15.060
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it got down to like 10,000</v>

220
00:09:15.061 --> 00:09:15.870
<v Speaker 2>people at one point.</v>

221
00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:21.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I was reading the article </v>

222
00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:21.260
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was also talking about um,</v>

223
00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:22.740
<v Speaker 2>in Sumatra.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we talked about this recently.</v>

224
00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:27.920
<v Speaker 2>There was a gigantic super volcano that </v>
<v Speaker 2>blew up and it fucked the earth up for </v>

225
00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.340
<v Speaker 2>like a thousand years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we had to survive that.</v>

226
00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:34.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now we're trying to survive twitter </v>

227
00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:34.370
<v Speaker 2>storms and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we have those same instincts,</v>

228
00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:37.440
<v Speaker 2>the same instincts that are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can't eat your dog right now,</v>

229
00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.230
<v Speaker 2>you're going to die with the Jesuit </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

230
00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:43.260
<v Speaker 2>So what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I just went on his and he had already</v>

231
00:09:43.261 --> 00:09:45.410
<v Speaker 2>blocked me and I had never written </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything to him.</v>

232
00:09:45.411 --> 00:09:47.790
<v Speaker 2>So I just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I just posted that instead he got,</v>

233
00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:52.850
<v Speaker 2>he has a liposuction is asked because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought that was funny because I didn't </v>

234
00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:52.850
<v Speaker 2>want to go too big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

235
00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:54.960
<v Speaker 2>well why even do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like who gives a shit if he blocks you.</v>

236
00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:56.970
<v Speaker 2>I just thought it was funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

237
00:09:56.971 --> 00:09:59.340
<v Speaker 2>But you're attacking them publicly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the thing.</v>

238
00:09:59.341 --> 00:10:02.220
<v Speaker 2>It's like you have like how many </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of twitter followers.</v>

239
00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:03.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 120,000.</v>

240
00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:05.800
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot of fucking people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a lot.</v>

241
00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:10.740
<v Speaker 2>But he's a strong man that have messed </v>
<v Speaker 2>with me way too long,</v>

242
00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:13.320
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's got to sting.</v>

243
00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:17.730
<v Speaker 2>There's got to be like this disturbance </v>
<v Speaker 2>of peace and tranquility for no reason.</v>

244
00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:20.800
<v Speaker 2>Just because he blocked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You give a shit if people.</v>

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:23.220
<v Speaker 2>I hope you gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like you.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I love a good guy.</v>

247
00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:26.710
<v Speaker 2>He's a great joke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

248
00:10:26.711 --> 00:10:27.810
<v Speaker 2>It's a funny guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

249
00:10:27.811 --> 00:10:30.660
<v Speaker 2>This is the problem is said like I'm a </v>
<v Speaker 2>colleague of his,</v>

250
00:10:30.661 --> 00:10:35.661
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the comedy store with him all the </v>

251
00:10:35.661 --> 00:10:37.161
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We go on back and forth next to each </v>

252
00:10:37.161 --> 00:10:39.861
<v Speaker 2>other all the time and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like you should attack someone when</v>

253
00:10:40.381 --> 00:10:43.410
<v Speaker 2>they do something really bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know what I'm saying?</v>

254
00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:48.410
<v Speaker 2>I do know what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the sheets stored until you </v>

255
00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:48.410
<v Speaker 2>absolutely need it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

256
00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:50.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm all about that and I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't like full attack mode.</v>

257
00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:54.030
<v Speaker 2>I was being playful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The wars started.</v>

258
00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:59.050
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about him getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>liposuction and talking about him being </v>

259
00:10:59.050 --> 00:10:59.940
<v Speaker 2>gay and you're talking about a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You said a bunch of different things,</v>

260
00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:05.060
<v Speaker 2>but that's after he said in response.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said that I'm an outright the third </v>

261
00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:06.840
<v Speaker 2>rate piano comic and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

262
00:11:06.841 --> 00:11:08.700
<v Speaker 2>I just did a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a liposuction joke,</v>

263
00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:13.260
<v Speaker 2>but the thing is I'm not even mad at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy at all like I want.</v>

264
00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:18.340
<v Speaker 2>Then again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do a terrible job of representing </v>

265
00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:21.321
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good point because it seems to </v>

266
00:11:21.321 --> 00:11:21.321
<v Speaker 2>me even I had a text you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

267
00:11:21.321 --> 00:11:21.321
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

268
00:11:21.321 --> 00:11:22.560
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to give you a compliment.</v>

269
00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:24.050
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>

270
00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:29.060
<v Speaker 2>You're more critical offline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're one of the few people right </v>

271
00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:29.060
<v Speaker 2>now in this world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

272
00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:29.830
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck are you doing?</v>

273
00:11:29.831 --> 00:11:34.831
<v Speaker 2>I love it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but online you're chill and so many </v>

274
00:11:34.831 --> 00:11:35.730
<v Speaker 2>people are the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They attack on line and apologize in the</v>

275
00:11:35.731 --> 00:11:40.731
<v Speaker 2>DM and you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to say that that's good </v>

276
00:11:40.731 --> 00:11:40.731
<v Speaker 2>leadership qualities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

277
00:11:40.731 --> 00:11:41.580
<v Speaker 2>well that's very nice for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not trying to be a leader.</v>

278
00:11:41.581 --> 00:11:46.581
<v Speaker 2>I just try to be a good person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if you you have an issue with </v>

279
00:11:46.581 --> 00:11:48.390
<v Speaker 2>someone you should do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should talk to them in person if you</v>

280
00:11:48.391 --> 00:11:49.920
<v Speaker 2>can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if not on the phone,</v>

281
00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:55.280
<v Speaker 2>but that one on one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this idea that you should </v>

282
00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:58.950
<v Speaker 2>automatically blurt out what you think </v>
<v Speaker 2>about someone's public mistakes to the </v>

283
00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:01.120
<v Speaker 2>rest of the world to state your </v>
<v Speaker 2>position.</v>

284
00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:06.360
<v Speaker 2>Like there was a lot of the requests to </v>
<v Speaker 2>state your position after Louis C K got </v>

285
00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:06.360
<v Speaker 2>in trouble.</v>

286
00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:09.020
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea what actually happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>

287
00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:13.010
<v Speaker 2>if the way that women are telling it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>100 percent true than I am,</v>

288
00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:17.080
<v Speaker 2>I think it's fucking gross and </v>
<v Speaker 2>disgusting and I'm sad.</v>

289
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:19.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm sad that he had that in his head </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he wanted to do that.</v>

290
00:12:19.601 --> 00:12:21.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm sad that the girls had to experience</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

291
00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:26.760
<v Speaker 2>It's an uncomfortable thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know that and I've heard </v>

292
00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:27.220
<v Speaker 2>stories about people thinking it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>funny too,</v>

293
00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:28.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's.</v>

294
00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:30.220
<v Speaker 2>There was like this weird thing going </v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

295
00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:32.260
<v Speaker 2>the tribal stuff where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what side,</v>

296
00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.380
<v Speaker 2>what side are you on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But people were like this,</v>

297
00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:39.450
<v Speaker 2>the Louis C,</v>
<v Speaker 2>k instance was the first instance so </v>

298
00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:40.090
<v Speaker 2>that I can recall where people were </v>
<v Speaker 2>demanding a response,</v>

299
00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:42.250
<v Speaker 2>like a public response about something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

300
00:12:42.251 --> 00:12:43.900
<v Speaker 2>I noticed that in entertainment with </v>
<v Speaker 2>trump,</v>

301
00:12:43.901 --> 00:12:47.520
<v Speaker 2>it's like the lack of talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>trump is now seen as endorsements.</v>

302
00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:51.550
<v Speaker 2>Like when Taylor swift just didn't get </v>
<v Speaker 2>involved in the chaos.</v>

303
00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:54.550
<v Speaker 2>People were calling her like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right man,</v>

304
00:12:54.551 --> 00:12:55.210
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

305
00:12:55.300 --> 00:13:00.300
<v Speaker 2>there's so many people just waiting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>waiting to pull the trigger and they're </v>

306
00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:05.251
<v Speaker 2>doing so in such a fucking insane and </v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculously misrepresentative way.</v>

307
00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:08.050
<v Speaker 2>There was something about Jordan </v>
<v Speaker 2>Peterson,</v>

308
00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:11.590
<v Speaker 2>Jordan Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to speak somewhere,</v>

309
00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:15.750
<v Speaker 2>and there was these people sending </v>
<v Speaker 2>emails that he was a Nazi and Oh yeah,</v>

310
00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:18.520
<v Speaker 2>schist and a racist and trans phobic and</v>
<v Speaker 2>just.</v>

311
00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:23.670
<v Speaker 2>But they're just hurling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These nuclear bombs have words with </v>

312
00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:23.800
<v Speaker 2>literal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Literally.</v>

313
00:13:23.801 --> 00:13:28.801
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're no thought whatsoever about the </v>

314
00:13:28.801 --> 00:13:32.041
<v Speaker 2>consequences of using these words to </v>
<v Speaker 2>describe someone who's absolutely </v>

315
00:13:32.041 --> 00:13:35.440
<v Speaker 2>clearly not that of course it's when </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone can't argue another side,</v>

316
00:13:35.441 --> 00:13:40.441
<v Speaker 2>they just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how they shut down the </v>

317
00:13:40.441 --> 00:13:40.441
<v Speaker 2>conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but here's my point,</v>

318
00:13:40.441 --> 00:13:43.171
<v Speaker 2>is that it elevates this manic </v>
<v Speaker 2>misrepresentation of reality because </v>

319
00:13:43.301 --> 00:13:45.730
<v Speaker 2>they've agreed to not look at it </v>
<v Speaker 2>realistically.</v>

320
00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:47.920
<v Speaker 2>They've agreed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who cares if he's not a Nazi,</v>

321
00:13:47.921 --> 00:13:51.000
<v Speaker 2>we're going to fucking calm Nazi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in doing that you,</v>

322
00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:51.590
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

323
00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.500
<v Speaker 2>you're escalating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's like,</v>

324
00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:55.210
<v Speaker 2>if there's a mob mentality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

325
00:13:55.211 --> 00:14:00.211
<v Speaker 2>It's part of what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things didn't happen to mom </v>

326
00:14:00.211 --> 00:14:00.211
<v Speaker 2>mentality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so people start murdering.</v>

327
00:14:00.211 --> 00:14:03.631
<v Speaker 2>People jump in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If people killing people and you're </v>

328
00:14:03.631 --> 00:14:03.700
<v Speaker 2>trying to get away the guys running at </v>
<v Speaker 2>you with a knife,</v>

329
00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:05.350
<v Speaker 2>you're going to fucking kill it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what people do.</v>

330
00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:08.650
<v Speaker 2>It's a normal thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It happens with my mentality to,</v>

331
00:14:08.651 --> 00:14:10.870
<v Speaker 2>to happens this with this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these kinds of arguments,</v>

332
00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:14.080
<v Speaker 2>the same kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People could just decide they don't care</v>

333
00:14:14.081 --> 00:14:19.081
<v Speaker 2>if you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to call you a fucking </v>

334
00:14:19.081 --> 00:14:19.081
<v Speaker 2>racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to call you a Nazi.</v>

335
00:14:19.081 --> 00:14:19.570
<v Speaker 2>They could just gonna keep saying it </v>
<v Speaker 2>until you believe it.</v>

336
00:14:19.571 --> 00:14:23.530
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this fucking Nazi Kurt Metzger.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Find out.</v>

461
00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:49.860
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not cheap.</v>

462
00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:52.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I only saw this fucking Julian.</v>

463
00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:52.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

464
00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:58.920
<v Speaker 1>Whenever you can go to his place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to my mountain,</v>

465
00:19:58.921 --> 00:20:00.360
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the whole thing all the time.</v>

466
00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:05.420
<v Speaker 1>What it is is your body has to feel like</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to die and when your body </v>

467
00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:08.511
<v Speaker 1>feels like it's going to die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it freaks out and produces these anti </v>

468
00:20:08.511 --> 00:20:10.310
<v Speaker 1>inflammation properties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's basically like twitter.</v>

469
00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:13.420
<v Speaker 1>The same thing with the sauna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know Barry Criminal Law.</v>

470
00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:18.600
<v Speaker 1>He wanted me and him went on tour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do that last year.</v>

471
00:20:18.601 --> 00:20:20.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy saved my life man.</v>

472
00:20:20.011 --> 00:20:21.600
<v Speaker 1>I was like in a bad way when that guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>called me.</v>

473
00:20:21.601 --> 00:20:22.320
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>

474
00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:27.710
<v Speaker 1>we got in a car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy driving on black ice and </v>

475
00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:28.620
<v Speaker 1>Pennsylvania where he tries to pass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say a tractor trailer,</v>

476
00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:33.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people don't want to be behind </v>

477
00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:34.890
<v Speaker 1>trailer so he goes to pass it and we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>like 60,</v>

478
00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:40.840
<v Speaker 1>which is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's under the speed limit but it's </v>

479
00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:40.840
<v Speaker 1>black ice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

480
00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:42.340
<v Speaker 1>so we're going next.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It felt like a jet engine sucking that.</v>

481
00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:46.110
<v Speaker 1>It was just wobbling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm in the passenger seat.</v>

482
00:20:46.111 --> 00:20:47.770
<v Speaker 1>Barry was behind the driver</v>

483
00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:52.330
<v Speaker 3>and we just get sucked into under the </v>
<v Speaker 3>trailer and the trailer.</v>

484
00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:53.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So my head,</v>

485
00:20:53.471 --> 00:20:58.471
<v Speaker 3>I mean I already got my head cut off and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had time to say what the fuck three </v>

486
00:20:58.471 --> 00:20:59.290
<v Speaker 3>times I didn't know what the fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck,</v>

487
00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:00.480
<v Speaker 3>and then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

488
00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:05.490
<v Speaker 3>I got some dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just remember thinking that swerved </v>

489
00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:08.910
<v Speaker 3>and then the back end,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like my it started going away from the </v>

490
00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:12.840
<v Speaker 3>trailer and the back end got caught </v>
<v Speaker 3>instead where no one was sitting that </v>

491
00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:14.790
<v Speaker 3>got pulled in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the windows blew in and then a drug us a</v>

492
00:21:14.791 --> 00:21:17.890
<v Speaker 3>little bit and spit us out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we spun in Atlanta in the median.</v>

493
00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:19.930
<v Speaker 3>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>

494
00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:22.150
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the driver was weeping.</v>

495
00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:24.970
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>me and barry were like,</v>

496
00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:26.110
<v Speaker 3>I swear to God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like high,</v>

497
00:21:26.111 --> 00:21:29.290
<v Speaker 3>like I have never felt I could do that </v>
<v Speaker 3>once a year,</v>

498
00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:31.820
<v Speaker 3>like a vacation to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I swear to God,</v>

499
00:21:31.821 --> 00:21:33.250
<v Speaker 3>I like it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I had to be.</v>

500
00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:34.600
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

501
00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:36.220
<v Speaker 3>I guess my brain thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to die,</v>

502
00:21:36.221 --> 00:21:40.180
<v Speaker 3>but I'm sure my body thought it was too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it felt fucking amazing.</v>

503
00:21:40.181 --> 00:21:41.650
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never felt anything like that.</v>

504
00:21:41.651 --> 00:21:44.980
<v Speaker 3>Like the be a trigger to die and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>just don't know what happens to vet.</v>

505
00:21:44.981 --> 00:21:47.050
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes when they come back they don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to admit it.</v>

506
00:21:47.051 --> 00:21:49.210
<v Speaker 3>But they got addicted to war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

507
00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:50.500
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Her locker,</v>

508
00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:52.330
<v Speaker 3>they can hurt law.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just thinking of that.</v>

509
00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:53.740
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's 100 percent legit.</v>

510
00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:58.770
<v Speaker 3>They also.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a good Sebastian younger book </v>

511
00:21:58.770 --> 00:21:58.770
<v Speaker 3>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read that based on your pod tribe.</v>

512
00:21:58.770 --> 00:21:59.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and these people,</v>

513
00:21:59.981 --> 00:22:04.981
<v Speaker 3>that's like the closest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have a field in each others when </v>

514
00:22:04.981 --> 00:22:04.981
<v Speaker 3>they're in the middle of a war zone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like me on twitter.</v>

515
00:22:04.981 --> 00:22:09.091
<v Speaker 3>Man was weird talking about his twitter </v>
<v Speaker 3>outbursts and poor representation of who</v>

516
00:22:10.181 --> 00:22:11.440
<v Speaker 3>he is as a person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>

517
00:22:11.441 --> 00:22:12.080
<v Speaker 3>so I don't understand.</v>

518
00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:15.900
<v Speaker 3>What did you settle the matter at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>

519
00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:18.520
<v Speaker 3>What do we say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing.</v>

520
00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:20.200
<v Speaker 3>He just blocked him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He blocked him on twitter,</v>

521
00:22:20.201 --> 00:22:22.780
<v Speaker 3>so he decided to not sure he blocked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You definitely blocked him.</v>

522
00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:25.960
<v Speaker 3>So I just said something that he had </v>
<v Speaker 3>wife on his ass.</v>

523
00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:29.290
<v Speaker 3>I didn't think that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good question.</v>

524
00:22:29.291 --> 00:22:30.230
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>

525
00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:32.310
<v Speaker 3>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not worth it.</v>

526
00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:35.260
<v Speaker 3>He was never a fat guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that's what it is.</v>

527
00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:36.310
<v Speaker 3>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it was like,</v>

528
00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:41.400
<v Speaker 3>because he's really handsome man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's like that is so funny to me to </v>

529
00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:42.280
<v Speaker 3>light weight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he did do that.</v>

530
00:22:42.281 --> 00:22:42.710
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

531
00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:44.380
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just made.</v>

532
00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:46.690
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it seems like a very extreme.</v>

533
00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:48.910
<v Speaker 3>It's just a funny insult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many comics,</v>

534
00:22:48.911 --> 00:22:51.280
<v Speaker 3>if you had a guest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had life on their ass over.</v>

535
00:22:51.281 --> 00:22:54.820
<v Speaker 3>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I had like a friend that was like,</v>

536
00:22:54.821 --> 00:22:55.460
<v Speaker 3>hey dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>

537
00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:59.450
<v Speaker 3>I do like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you would want to do some friend.</v>

538
00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:05.280
<v Speaker 3>You have to wear like this crazy </v>
<v Speaker 3>compression close afterwards to really </v>

539
00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:06.190
<v Speaker 3>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a joke.</v>

540
00:23:06.191 --> 00:23:08.380
<v Speaker 3>Then I probably want to do is fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>surgery.</v>

541
00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:09.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

542
00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:09.540
<v Speaker 3>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

543
00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:14.640
<v Speaker 3>they're good numbing your shit up and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going in with a god damn pipe </v>

544
00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:18.360
<v Speaker 3>that's got a vacuum attached to it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're roughing you up and sucking </v>

545
00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:20.380
<v Speaker 3>chunks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Violent.</v>

546
00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:25.430
<v Speaker 3>It looks fucking mad at how fat you are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably doesn't work because you don't </v>

547
00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:26.440
<v Speaker 3>change your habits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Either tape works,</v>

548
00:23:26.441 --> 00:23:28.990
<v Speaker 3>but listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get fat again,</v>

549
00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:31.150
<v Speaker 3>like it'll make you look good for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit,</v>

550
00:23:31.151 --> 00:23:33.410
<v Speaker 3>but if you don't change how you eat your</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

551
00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:35.500
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your static state right now where you're</v>

552
00:23:35.501 --> 00:23:36.790
<v Speaker 3>at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're getting fatter.</v>

553
00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:38.680
<v Speaker 3>Most people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most people,</v>

554
00:23:38.681 --> 00:23:40.810
<v Speaker 3>if they're overweight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're getting more overweight.</v>

555
00:23:40.811 --> 00:23:42.640
<v Speaker 3>They're not steady at at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

556
00:23:42.641 --> 00:23:44.500
<v Speaker 3>whatever the fuck it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>50 pounds over.</v>

557
00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:46.010
<v Speaker 3>They keep keep going</v>

558
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:48.110
<v Speaker 1>because it's the same pattern of </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior,</v>

559
00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:49.760
<v Speaker 1>so if you get yourself sucked down </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

560
00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:53.330
<v Speaker 1>I know people have done this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get yourself sucked down with the vacuum</v>

561
00:23:53.331 --> 00:23:58.331
<v Speaker 1>down to a good legitimate size.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just balloon back up and a lot of </v>

562
00:23:58.331 --> 00:24:02.711
<v Speaker 1>times there's a lot of unevenness why </v>
<v Speaker 1>people get fat and weird places because </v>

563
00:24:02.711 --> 00:24:07.031
<v Speaker 1>they took out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get a little out right around the </v>

564
00:24:07.031 --> 00:24:09.581
<v Speaker 1>winter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I got a quarter inch in </v>

565
00:24:09.581 --> 00:24:09.581
<v Speaker 1>there that isn't being abused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fat.</v>

566
00:24:09.581 --> 00:24:13.150
<v Speaker 1>It's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're saying based fat out </v>

567
00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:14.780
<v Speaker 1>your blood can get lumpy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking wouldn't be smooth.</v>

568
00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:19.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like at least if you've got a natural </v>

569
00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:19.930
<v Speaker 1>layer of fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a smooth.</v>

570
00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:21.660
<v Speaker 1>It feels right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I suppose it doesn't work.</v>

571
00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:22.540
<v Speaker 1>I've seen people like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

572
00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:24.950
<v Speaker 1>you understand I can't develop pectoral </v>
<v Speaker 1>muscles.</v>

573
00:24:24.951 --> 00:24:29.951
<v Speaker 1>I had showed her nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's nonsense because like I can't do </v>

574
00:24:31.191 --> 00:24:31.730
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

575
00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:32.690
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not true.</v>

576
00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:34.850
<v Speaker 1>There's all these talk shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These guys are packing plants.</v>

577
00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:35.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>know dude,</v>

578
00:24:35.761 --> 00:24:39.560
<v Speaker 1>who have one of those I know do two </v>
<v Speaker 1>implants and how did it end up for her?</v>

579
00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:40.410
<v Speaker 1>Not so good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

580
00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:41.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so good.</v>

581
00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:46.690
<v Speaker 1>That sounds real bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he wound up killing himself because </v>

582
00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:46.690
<v Speaker 1>of something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

583
00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:50.670
<v Speaker 1>Here it is life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ in the holy fuck.</v>

584
00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:53.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be scared.</v>

585
00:24:53.571 --> 00:24:54.890
<v Speaker 1>What's under the fat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My ass.</v>

586
00:24:54.891 --> 00:24:56.270
<v Speaker 1>I got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what's under there.</v>

587
00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:59.840
<v Speaker 1>This step limits cut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There might be a look at this,</v>

588
00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:04.860
<v Speaker 1>this weird shape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's blood loss and maximizes post op </v>

589
00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:08.561
<v Speaker 1>comfort and what they're doing is going </v>
<v Speaker 1>in on this person's stomach and just </v>

590
00:25:08.561 --> 00:25:11.000
<v Speaker 1>sucking tubes of it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing.</v>

591
00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:12.940
<v Speaker 1>This guy's not even that fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

592
00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:16.960
<v Speaker 1>that's a little bit all this guy or Gal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

593
00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:19.340
<v Speaker 1>We're only looking at a building site </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Joseph was already hot.</v>

594
00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:21.920
<v Speaker 1>He just was getting a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like handsome guy.</v>

595
00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:26.930
<v Speaker 1>That's like so irreverent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's really funny how it </v>

596
00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:29.620
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at the little fucking edges on the </v>

597
00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:29.620
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

598
00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:29.840
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is disgusting.</v>

599
00:25:29.841 --> 00:25:32.090
<v Speaker 1>This thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look how like you see,</v>

600
00:25:32.091 --> 00:25:34.180
<v Speaker 1>like when he was going back it up a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little jamie.</v>

601
00:25:34.490 --> 00:25:37.160
<v Speaker 1>Those little things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those holes that like little knives,</v>

602
00:25:37.161 --> 00:25:38.600
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a little bit.</v>

603
00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:43.650
<v Speaker 1>This is violent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a good few little knives in the </v>

604
00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:44.570
<v Speaker 1>end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's took a cat's Dick,</v>

605
00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:48.230
<v Speaker 1>so he's just scooping it out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this a woman or a man?</v>

606
00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:53.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if someone is not that fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If whoever the fuck this is,</v>

607
00:25:53.241 --> 00:25:56.660
<v Speaker 1>if they just got on the carb free diet </v>
<v Speaker 1>for like a couple of weeks,</v>

608
00:25:56.810 --> 00:26:00.310
<v Speaker 1>it's not even like a thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That long of weight to lose.</v>

609
00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:02.660
<v Speaker 1>I know a lady who didn't need it and got</v>
<v Speaker 1>it done.</v>

610
00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:04.730
<v Speaker 1>She literally didn't need it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

611
00:26:04.731 --> 00:26:09.731
<v Speaker 1>I don't know her that well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I remember her friends saying how </v>

612
00:26:09.731 --> 00:26:12.761
<v Speaker 1>much extreme discomfort she was in </v>
<v Speaker 1>because she had to wear essentially </v>

613
00:26:12.761 --> 00:26:12.761
<v Speaker 1>elect this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these tights.</v>

614
00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:18.850
<v Speaker 1>Super tight compression pants everywhere</v>
<v Speaker 1>to keep all your ass fat together is an </v>

615
00:26:19.871 --> 00:26:22.620
<v Speaker 1>amazing deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So debt.</v>

616
00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:26.710
<v Speaker 1>What I was having my ass fat loosened a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little.</v>

617
00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:31.750
<v Speaker 1>I had a hair transplant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the dumbest thing I've ever </v>

618
00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:31.750
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the Feldman,</v>

619
00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:32.690
<v Speaker 1>that's what he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was giant scar in the back of my head.</v>

620
00:26:32.691 --> 00:26:35.480
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a smile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that's a piece of meat.</v>

621
00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:37.280
<v Speaker 1>My job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get like a scar from it.</v>

622
00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:39.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My joke was that it's like taking people</v>

623
00:26:39.621 --> 00:26:44.621
<v Speaker 1>from a town where everybody is healthy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and moving them into a town where </v>

624
00:26:44.621 --> 00:26:45.770
<v Speaker 1>everybody's dying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Feeling ones that were left elected,</v>

625
00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:49.030
<v Speaker 1>new recruits the hair that was supposed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be up there.</v>

626
00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:55.450
<v Speaker 1>So where do you get it from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like other parts of it from the back of </v>

627
00:26:55.450 --> 00:26:57.891
<v Speaker 1>your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They take a strip off of that now the </v>

628
00:26:57.891 --> 00:26:57.891
<v Speaker 1>way they do it and a lot of places they </v>
<v Speaker 1>do it differently.</v>

629
00:26:57.891 --> 00:27:02.001
<v Speaker 1>Do one individual follicle at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just was scared that it was going </v>

630
00:27:02.001 --> 00:27:02.520
<v Speaker 1>bald.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

631
00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:04.710
<v Speaker 1>what can you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they tell you they could fix it.</v>

632
00:27:04.711 --> 00:27:05.400
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh great.</v>

633
00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:08.550
<v Speaker 1>I'll just get it fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it doesn't really fix it now.</v>

634
00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:12.510
<v Speaker 1>Well how come?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because Joel Mchale from suit,</v>

635
00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:15.150
<v Speaker 1>because I remember him from those Burger</v>
<v Speaker 1>King commercials where you had less hair</v>

636
00:27:15.151 --> 00:27:18.030
<v Speaker 1>than I do and it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now he's got Dragon Ball Z.</v>

637
00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:20.370
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's real thick.</v>

638
00:27:20.371 --> 00:27:25.371
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like more thick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they start with some killer </v>

639
00:27:25.371 --> 00:27:25.740
<v Speaker 1>transplant or is that just a great head </v>
<v Speaker 1>of hair man?</v>

640
00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:28.110
<v Speaker 1>You remember the Burger King Commercial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

641
00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:28.590
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

642
00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:29.250
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not.</v>

643
00:27:29.290 --> 00:27:34.290
<v Speaker 1>Nobody does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was when the office was getting </v>

644
00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:36.231
<v Speaker 1>popular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to put the American one and Burger </v>

645
00:27:36.231 --> 00:27:38.840
<v Speaker 1>King at these commercials that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kinda like the office and he was like </v>

646
00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:40.290
<v Speaker 1>the wider picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One Burger have thicker hair,</v>

647
00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:41.910
<v Speaker 1>works better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every bald guys.</v>

648
00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:44.430
<v Speaker 1>Fucking hair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More hair.</v>

649
00:27:44.431 --> 00:27:48.600
<v Speaker 1>I remember people with a thick hair </v>
<v Speaker 1>follicles can get away with it.</v>

650
00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:50.310
<v Speaker 1>Like my hair would have looked way </v>
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>

651
00:27:50.311 --> 00:27:52.980
<v Speaker 1>but I have thin hair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hair's themselves are thin.</v>

652
00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:58.280
<v Speaker 1>So if someone has thick hair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could prove they could have some </v>

653
00:27:58.280 --> 00:27:58.280
<v Speaker 1>pretty dramatic result of it's the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of thinning.</v>

654
00:27:59.100 --> 00:27:59.820
<v Speaker 1>Dirty?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

655
00:27:59.821 --> 00:28:01.530
<v Speaker 1>not even 30.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

656
00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:03.410
<v Speaker 1>but what did you tell him to 31?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

657
00:28:03.411 --> 00:28:08.411
<v Speaker 1>I think I was 28.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just started acting on TV and I was </v>

658
00:28:08.411 --> 00:28:10.020
<v Speaker 1>panicking because my hair was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously fallen out and I was like,</v>

659
00:28:10.021 --> 00:28:11.520
<v Speaker 1>this shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going quick,</v>

660
00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:17.120
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well where's it going to go and get </v>

661
00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:17.400
<v Speaker 1>thicker pubes?</v>

662
00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:23.130
<v Speaker 1>I knew that part of the reason why I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>making money was the way I looked.</v>

663
00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:27.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was doing stand up and I was acting in</v>

664
00:28:27.361 --> 00:28:30.720
<v Speaker 1>these shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I wasn't an ugly dude and it helped,</v>

665
00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:35.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it was getting certain kinds of </v>

666
00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:35.870
<v Speaker 1>roles like boyfriend roles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's chicken has to go through it.</v>

667
00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:37.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be panic because you're like,</v>

668
00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:39.750
<v Speaker 1>well this is how I'm making money and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>never made any money before.</v>

669
00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:44.870
<v Speaker 1>So all of a sudden I went from being </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely broke and being a super </v>

670
00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:46.050
<v Speaker 1>struggling comic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if I got lucky,</v>

671
00:28:46.051 --> 00:28:48.830
<v Speaker 1>I was making 300 a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three 50 a week was a big.</v>

672
00:28:48.970 --> 00:28:50.710
<v Speaker 1>Was that bad?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That bad for a week.</v>

673
00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:53.820
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a 25 year old guy,</v>

674
00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:55.920
<v Speaker 1>which is what I was trying to make it as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a comic,</v>

675
00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:59.820
<v Speaker 1>then it went from that to making fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit piles of money and you're like,</v>

676
00:28:59.821 --> 00:29:01.110
<v Speaker 1>how do I not move back?</v>

677
00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:04.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm not getting rid of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Figuring out a way to keep this rolling,</v>

678
00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:06.490
<v Speaker 1>but if I should've just shaved my head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just didn't know.</v>

679
00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:08.890
<v Speaker 1>Freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freedom.</v>

680
00:29:09.290 --> 00:29:12.270
<v Speaker 1>Now even if I grew like a thick head of </v>
<v Speaker 1>hair,</v>

681
00:29:12.271 --> 00:29:14.040
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you it's still shaved my </v>
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

682
00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:19.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to go to a barber.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a really nice lady used to cut my </v>

683
00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:19.370
<v Speaker 1>hair too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I loved her.</v>

684
00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:19.830
<v Speaker 1>She's fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fun conversations,</v>

685
00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:24.330
<v Speaker 1>but I'd have to go to we're fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>place and she'd have to come and wake up</v>

686
00:29:24.331 --> 00:29:27.890
<v Speaker 1>every four day like a wine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's your mommy?</v>

687
00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:31.050
<v Speaker 1>Could you talk about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That chilling pursuit,</v>

688
00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:36.060
<v Speaker 1>but I was on Samba Gb smoothies at this </v>
<v Speaker 1>dinner show where it'd be like a couple </v>

689
00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:37.960
<v Speaker 1>of athletes and like a couple of comics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

690
00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:40.650
<v Speaker 1>and I don't because I don't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>follow sports,</v>

691
00:29:40.651 --> 00:29:42.100
<v Speaker 1>but these guys were originally as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hockey player</v>

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:47.100
<v Speaker 4>in some football players in which </v>
<v Speaker 4>minority and they're talking about all </v>

693

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

694

695
00:29:49.361 --> 00:29:53.890
<v Speaker 4>for rich fuck in Hollywood women real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then they trickle down to athletes.</v>

696
00:29:55.420 --> 00:30:00.420
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I swear to God they were talking about </v>

697
00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:03.541
<v Speaker 4>Cryo that way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it was for fucking hot checks </v>

<v Speaker 4>like Blue Bluer face out from that shit </v>

701
00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:17.320
<v Speaker 4>on steroids for arthritis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No Way.</v>

702
00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:22.470
<v Speaker 4>She didn't want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want people to know about some </v>

703
00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:23.140
<v Speaker 4>illness which start to get less work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So she just took all the jokes about how</v>

<v Speaker 4>She just took all the jokes to work and </v>

711
00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:43.940
<v Speaker 4>It's a character building,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sky,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Interfaces with the world.</v>

716
00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:54.670
<v Speaker 4>Like the most popular celebrity </v>
<v Speaker 4>possible.</v>

717
00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:57.220
<v Speaker 4>Beautiful woman is like Tom Cruise </v>
<v Speaker 4>everywhere she goes.</v>

718
00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:00.270
<v Speaker 4>It's like Michael Cost as a bit about </v>
<v Speaker 4>the same amount of data.</v>

719
00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:01.870
<v Speaker 4>It's almost the same amount of danger </v>
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>

720
00:31:01.871 --> 00:31:04.740
<v Speaker 4>Have you got to watch who's coming up on</v>
<v Speaker 4>you?</v>

721
00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:07.570
<v Speaker 4>Like how famous person with worse though</v>
<v Speaker 4>for girls.</v>

722
00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:11.890
<v Speaker 4>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>men are dangerous and that's why we have</v>

723
00:31:11.891 --> 00:31:16.891
<v Speaker 4>a system called the patriarchy took </v>
<v Speaker 4>women cost been a great system to </v>

724
00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:20.510
<v Speaker 4>protect women from the ages of men </v>
<v Speaker 4>called Patriarchy and we threw it.</v>

725
00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:26.730
<v Speaker 4>We throw it away because the colleges.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's important to talk about </v>

726
00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:28.990
<v Speaker 4>Patriarchy because I feel that young 20 </v>
<v Speaker 4>year old women need their own Illuminati</v>

727
00:31:28.991 --> 00:31:30.060
<v Speaker 4>to talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

728
00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:33.280
<v Speaker 4>their failures on it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

729
00:31:33.281 --> 00:31:36.300
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's Illuminati for girls </v>
<v Speaker 4>conspiracy,</v>

730
00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:40.660
<v Speaker 4>patriarchy to ask for the set </v>
<v Speaker 4>definition.</v>

731
00:31:40.661 --> 00:31:42.930
<v Speaker 4>There isn't one is that suspicious?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Same with racist.</v>

732
00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:45.430
<v Speaker 4>There is one in the dictionary,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's not the accepted one.</v>

733
00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:47.620
<v Speaker 4>Ask just any online feminist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does it mean?</v>

734
00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:52.650
<v Speaker 4>There's no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well you can be whatever you want to be </v>

735
00:31:52.650 --> 00:31:52.650
<v Speaker 4>like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

736
00:31:52.650 --> 00:31:55.111
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it means you're my ex boyfriend named </v>

737
00:31:55.111 --> 00:31:55.930
<v Speaker 4>Gary Click of mean girls is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>patriarchy are in a position of power.</v>

738
00:31:56.050 --> 00:32:01.050
<v Speaker 4>That's the patriarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But men have been in the workplace for </v>

739
00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:01.660
<v Speaker 4>hundreds of years more than women is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that there's a real problem.</v>

740
00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:04.180
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it should be caught up.</v>

741
00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:09.240
<v Speaker 4>But what about when you hear this shit </v>
<v Speaker 4>where somebody goes and people wonder </v>

742
00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:09.950
<v Speaker 4>where all the female comedians like?</v>

743
00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:10.880
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

744
00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:15.040
<v Speaker 4>two people talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When Louie got shellacked by that fucked</v>

745
00:32:15.041 --> 00:32:18.220
<v Speaker 4>up article,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people were saying that shit about you.</v>

746
00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:21.130
<v Speaker 4>How come there's not an equal number of </v>
<v Speaker 4>female comedians to males?</v>

747
00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:26.310
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because women are treated better in our </v>

748
00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:26.310
<v Speaker 4>society.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

749
00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:26.590
<v Speaker 4>If there's damage amount of female </v>
<v Speaker 4>Comedians,</v>

750
00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:31.710
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>women are being abused way more than </v>

751
00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:31.710
<v Speaker 4>ever because you don't get in this job </v>
<v Speaker 4>from a happy.</v>

752
00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:34.660
<v Speaker 4>This job isn't about support.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's you get last because you fucked up.</v>

753
00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:39.840
<v Speaker 4>So I hope there's not a lot of women in </v>
<v Speaker 4>it that would mean they're being raped </v>

754
00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:40.010
<v Speaker 4>more does that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it is</v>

755
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:43.120
<v Speaker 1>also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just from a female perspective of a</v>

756
00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:48.130
<v Speaker 1>chick's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's harder because something happened </v>

757
00:32:48.130 --> 00:32:48.130
<v Speaker 1>to her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't,</v>

758
00:32:48.130 --> 00:32:48.770
<v Speaker 1>but they can't talk about certain things</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

759
00:32:48.771 --> 00:32:53.771
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no man wants to see a woman on stage </v>

760
00:32:53.771 --> 00:32:54.890
<v Speaker 1>telling politic stories or politic </v>
<v Speaker 1>jokes.</v>

761
00:32:55.090 --> 00:32:59.330
<v Speaker 1>It's funny you say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it did create a daily show.</v>

762
00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:00.710
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you,</v>

763
00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:04.230
<v Speaker 1>but most people in the audience for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman started out.</v>

764
00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:08.570
<v Speaker 1>I won't rule out anything if I'll take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't say any premise has hacky,</v>

765
00:33:08.571 --> 00:33:13.571
<v Speaker 1>just punch line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if your premise is airline fucking </v>

766
00:33:13.571 --> 00:33:13.571
<v Speaker 1>peanuts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>

767
00:33:13.571 --> 00:33:14.360
<v Speaker 1>Tell me what your punchline is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe a punchline justifies it.</v>

768
00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:15.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

769
00:33:15.450 --> 00:33:20.150
<v Speaker 1>I won't rule out any premise on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>premises or hacky,</v>

770
00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:21.530
<v Speaker 1>but people probably don't want to hear </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

771
00:33:21.531 --> 00:33:22.220
<v Speaker 1>But who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

772
00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:23.090
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

773
00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:28.120
<v Speaker 1>if you can get people to listen to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit that they basically don't want to </v>

774
00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:28.120
<v Speaker 1>hear.</v>

775
00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:28.220
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh great,</v>

776
00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:30.290
<v Speaker 1>this is where I used to do the black </v>
<v Speaker 1>rooms I started.</v>

777
00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:33.080
<v Speaker 1>So I totally agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm totally in agreement with you.</v>

778
00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:35.330
<v Speaker 1>We're not talking about drinking caveman</v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee.</v>

779
00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:40.630
<v Speaker 1>We're not talking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel wired is wicked from 270 </v>

780
00:33:40.821 --> 00:33:42.040
<v Speaker 1>milligrams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many did you have?</v>

781
00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:43.010
<v Speaker 1>Like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

782
00:33:43.011 --> 00:33:44.630
<v Speaker 1>I just started skipping one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like,</v>

783
00:33:44.631 --> 00:33:47.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm the one that's empty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you black out and suck though?</v>

784
00:33:47.671 --> 00:33:48.890
<v Speaker 1>Ingestion?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just drank one.</v>

785
00:33:48.891 --> 00:33:52.580
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is this dude talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>me?</v>

786
00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:57.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about most people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When a woman goes on stage and does </v>

787
00:33:57.940 --> 00:34:01.661
<v Speaker 1>stand up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people that are going to be in the </v>

788
00:34:01.661 --> 00:34:03.251
<v Speaker 1>audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's men that are just not going to </v>

789
00:34:03.251 --> 00:34:05.921
<v Speaker 1>want to hear you talk about politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's men that are not going to want </v>

790
00:34:05.921 --> 00:34:05.921
<v Speaker 1>to talk about sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's harder for a woman.</v>

791
00:34:05.921 --> 00:34:07.700
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a harder position.</v>

792
00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:09.950
<v Speaker 1>Being a standup comic for a woman is </v>
<v Speaker 1>just harder.</v>

793
00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:15.100
<v Speaker 1>So I think if it's harder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're naturally going to see less </v>

794
00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:15.350
<v Speaker 1>people doing it and then there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>naturally less people inclined to do it,</v>

795
00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:18.770
<v Speaker 1>but it's just like female mma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like most women are not going to do it.</v>

796
00:34:18.771 --> 00:34:20.090
<v Speaker 1>But guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of women do it.</v>

797
00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:22.160
<v Speaker 1>If you're the type that does it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fucking do it,</v>

798
00:34:22.161 --> 00:34:25.520
<v Speaker 1>but there's no fucking weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about the Patriarchy in an mma?</v>

799
00:34:25.521 --> 00:34:27.260
<v Speaker 1>Why Arthur equal number of women than </v>
<v Speaker 1>men?</v>

800
00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:28.620
<v Speaker 1>You don't say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

801
00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:32.450
<v Speaker 1>They're not really fans of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I noticed that.</v>

802
00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:33.680
<v Speaker 1>Remember who the think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

803
00:34:33.681 --> 00:34:35.360
<v Speaker 1>I think it's because it's an untenable </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument.</v>

804
00:34:35.390 --> 00:34:40.390
<v Speaker 1>What you can't say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This should be an equal amount of women </v>

805
00:34:40.390 --> 00:34:43.661
<v Speaker 1>fighting as men because it's not getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>punched in the face area.</v>

806
00:34:43.970 --> 00:34:47.990
<v Speaker 1>That's one area where we agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one area we get to a goal.</v>

807
00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:48.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well men are.</v>

808
00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:50.190
<v Speaker 1>They do this better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is.</v>

809
00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:55.210
<v Speaker 1>They do it more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're doing it constantly and there's </v>

810
00:34:55.210 --> 00:34:55.400
<v Speaker 1>some elite female athletes in mma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't get me wrong,</v>

811
00:34:55.490 --> 00:34:57.310
<v Speaker 1>of course rivaled the elite athletes of </v>
<v Speaker 1>men,</v>

812
00:34:57.320 --> 00:35:02.320
<v Speaker 1>but they used to summit and they had the</v>
<v Speaker 1>operation when more men fucking way </v>

813
00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:05.801
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not even seen with </v>

814
00:35:05.801 --> 00:35:05.801
<v Speaker 1>basketball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was watching sport,</v>

815
00:35:05.801 --> 00:35:05.801
<v Speaker 1>I hope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

816
00:35:05.801 --> 00:35:09.970
<v Speaker 1>but my point is the same as standup </v>
<v Speaker 1>stand is another getting punched in the </v>

817
00:35:09.970 --> 00:35:12.380
<v Speaker 1>face sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me that's super fucking difficult.</v>

818
00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:14.990
<v Speaker 1>You take an emotional beat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people don't want to do it.</v>

819
00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:20.110
<v Speaker 1>It's not a judgment call.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like you're better or you're </v>

820
00:35:20.110 --> 00:35:21.540
<v Speaker 1>worse picks you because the people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>left that I started,</v>

821
00:35:21.610 --> 00:35:22.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you think of when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>started,</v>

822
00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:26.060
<v Speaker 1>people thought that were funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that left and people that stage,</v>

823
00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:29.120
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe you're still here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's clearly a calling at Nada.</v>

824
00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:30.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to take a beat it.</v>

825
00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:32.990
<v Speaker 1>Some people just decide to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've had enough.</v>

826
00:35:33.010 --> 00:35:38.010
<v Speaker 1>They like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to get off this fucking </v>

827
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:38.010
<v Speaker 1>ride.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

828
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:38.010
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of guys that were like big</v>
<v Speaker 1>time touring headliners and they get to</v>

829
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:40.920
<v Speaker 3>a point though the fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We usually go to vegas or something,</v>

830
00:35:40.930 --> 00:35:41.400
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

831
00:35:41.401 --> 00:35:46.401
<v Speaker 3>They do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or they just fucking get some sort of a </v>

832
00:35:46.401 --> 00:35:46.740
<v Speaker 3>writing job sometimes get writing jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

833
00:35:46.741 --> 00:35:50.620
<v Speaker 3>they started doing tree work like me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>middle of nowhere.</v>

834
00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:53.040
<v Speaker 3>Just start cutting down trees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

835
00:35:53.041 --> 00:35:54.660
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I liked the writer's guild,</v>

836
00:35:54.661 --> 00:35:55.350
<v Speaker 3>but listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

837
00:35:55.351 --> 00:36:00.351
<v Speaker 3>anybody who thinks that should be an </v>
<v Speaker 3>equal number of men or women in any job </v>

838
00:36:00.351 --> 00:36:04.580
<v Speaker 3>and that if there's no clear evidence </v>
<v Speaker 3>that this is a neutral occupation,</v>

839
00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:08.790
<v Speaker 3>that this is an occupation that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>favor any gender,</v>

840
00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:11.790
<v Speaker 3>like there's got to be jobs where it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>equally represented,</v>

841
00:36:11.791 --> 00:36:13.410
<v Speaker 3>men and women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Outside of that,</v>

842
00:36:13.590 --> 00:36:15.750
<v Speaker 3>your job is what you choose to do with </v>
<v Speaker 3>your life.</v>

843
00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:20.780
<v Speaker 3>When boys grow up playing with fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>trucks and superheros and girls grow up </v>

844
00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:25.461
<v Speaker 3>playing with dolls and they obviously </v>
<v Speaker 3>are more inclined in this direction and </v>

845
00:36:25.461 --> 00:36:29.441
<v Speaker 3>men are more inclined in that direction </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we expect them to meet at any </v>

846
00:36:29.441 --> 00:36:31.570
<v Speaker 3>interest and then we would that we would</v>
<v Speaker 3>force it and force it,</v>

847
00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:33.750
<v Speaker 3>ruins it for women.</v>

848
00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:38.750
<v Speaker 3>It makes them think that they should do </v>
<v Speaker 3>jobs that they might not enjoy and then </v>

849
00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:38.750
<v Speaker 3>they get really depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

850
00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:42.951
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or they think that they need to prove </v>

851
00:36:42.951 --> 00:36:42.951
<v Speaker 3>themselves by doing a man's job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

852
00:36:42.951 --> 00:36:43.360
<v Speaker 3>Instead of just doing what they actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>enjoyed doing.</v>

853
00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:44.220
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

854
00:36:44.221 --> 00:36:45.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's funny.</v>

855
00:36:45.241 --> 00:36:50.241
<v Speaker 3>As long as I can remember,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my mom wanted to work and she got a job </v>

856
00:36:50.241 --> 00:36:50.730
<v Speaker 3>and then she was mad because she wanted </v>
<v Speaker 3>to stop working because it's um,</v>

857
00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:56.600
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it just depends on the level of </v>

858
00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:56.600
<v Speaker 3>need,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

859
00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:56.720
<v Speaker 3>Like what if there's like a war or a bad</v>
<v Speaker 3>economy?</v>

860
00:36:56.740 --> 00:36:58.810
<v Speaker 3>So I'm guessing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you going to go get people?</v>

861
00:36:58.860 --> 00:36:59.840
<v Speaker 3>That's a different thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

862
00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:04.850
<v Speaker 3>It's different during the war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like everybody was sort of bonded </v>

863
00:37:04.850 --> 00:37:05.610
<v Speaker 3>together because they make shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly.</v>

864
00:37:05.611 --> 00:37:07.790
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there seems to be a much more of a uh,</v>

865
00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:09.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes my girlfriend,</v>

866
00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:12.230
<v Speaker 3>my girlfriend's at college,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

867
00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:17.510
<v Speaker 3>I realize isn't even ties in with this </v>
<v Speaker 3>jazz night thing because I realized or </v>

868
00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:22.310
<v Speaker 3>she realized that like half the bad </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that happened to her in the last </v>

869
00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:22.310
<v Speaker 3>four years were social media related.</v>

870
00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:27.260
<v Speaker 3>All this lyric or maybe all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking about it like if I think </v>

871
00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:30.190
<v Speaker 3>all the bullshit like stress on my life </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I had in his fucking need.</v>

872
00:37:30.330 --> 00:37:35.330
<v Speaker 3>It is real though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I've had a couple of theaters can </v>

873
00:37:35.330 --> 00:37:37.290
<v Speaker 3>say like ruined my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Strangers like set out.</v>

874
00:37:37.291 --> 00:37:39.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to ruin your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like where I was like,</v>

875
00:37:39.421 --> 00:37:40.750
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got a lot of dude it.</v>

876
00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:42.930

<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

877
00:37:42.931 --> 00:37:44.810
<v Speaker 3>That's when you get theaters canceled </v>
<v Speaker 3>for.</v>

878
00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:47.880
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I booked a two art schools.</v>

879
00:37:47.881 --> 00:37:52.881
<v Speaker 3>I just paid them to run it like the area</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I sold it out myself and then they </v>

880
00:37:52.881 --> 00:37:56.090
<v Speaker 3>would just cancel saying that I do hate </v>
<v Speaker 3>speech or something saying,</v>

881
00:37:56.700 --> 00:38:01.700
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's one merit in Chicago and then </v>

<v Speaker 3>Chicago and Brooklyn though are hotbeds </v>

<v Speaker 3>It was fucking amazing resource in </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

903
00:38:42.731 --> 00:38:44.020
<v Speaker 3>Like seven years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was sick.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Fucking fun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 3>it's easy to forget or happy to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

907
00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:53.120
<v Speaker 3>You know this horse shit because this </v>
<v Speaker 3>cult that these people are in that's in </v>

908
00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:54.460
<v Speaker 3>Hollywood and New York and Chicago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>religious there.</v>

909
00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:56.770
<v Speaker 3>It's not the rest of the country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People aren't,</v>

910
00:38:56.830 --> 00:39:01.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the thing that you get fooled </v>

911
00:39:01.830 --> 00:39:01.830
<v Speaker 3>with social media as you think this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>reality,</v>

912
00:39:01.830 --> 00:39:02.590
<v Speaker 3>but it is everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they don't like it.</v>

913
00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:04.720
<v Speaker 3>That's the difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like how it would connect people being</v>

914
00:39:04.721 --> 00:39:05.290
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh no,</v>

915
00:39:05.291 --> 00:39:10.291
<v Speaker 3>this is great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it is in other colleges and college </v>

916
00:39:10.291 --> 00:39:15.150
<v Speaker 3>kids write me that they have to sign a </v>
<v Speaker 3>white privileged contract like the </v>

917
00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:18.901
<v Speaker 3>college I've seen them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at least they know it means they </v>

918
00:39:18.901 --> 00:39:18.901
<v Speaker 3>acknowledged their white privilege,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is basically.</v>

919
00:39:18.901 --> 00:39:23.590
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something that happens usually for </v>

920
00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:25.260
<v Speaker 3>genocide or whatnot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we put you acknowledge your </v>

921
00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:25.260
<v Speaker 3>privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have it easier.</v>

922
00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:25.780
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never heard of grow.</v>

923
00:39:25.781 --> 00:39:26.620
<v Speaker 3>It's unreal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

924
00:39:26.621 --> 00:39:31.621
<v Speaker 3>they're giving kids in certain schools </v>
<v Speaker 3>are given kids lectures on gender and </v>

925
00:39:31.621 --> 00:39:35.611
<v Speaker 3>then how some people are gender fluid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning that they can switch back and </v>

926
00:39:35.611 --> 00:39:35.920
<v Speaker 3>forth from male to female at anytime.</v>

927
00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:37.900
<v Speaker 3>Like at what point in time do we go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

928
00:39:39.250 --> 00:39:44.250
<v Speaker 3>maybe that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what's the odds that that's </v>

929
00:39:44.250 --> 00:39:45.880
<v Speaker 3>nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The 100 percent overwhelming.</v>

930
00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:48.280
<v Speaker 3>I mean Kim,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might be someone with some sort of a</v>

931
00:39:48.281 --> 00:39:53.281
<v Speaker 3>psychological disorder where they do </v>
<v Speaker 3>bounce back and forth between being a </v>

932
00:39:53.281 --> 00:39:53.281
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a woman,</v>

933
00:39:53.281 --> 00:39:57.480
<v Speaker 3>but at what point in time could we </v>
<v Speaker 3>recognize this as a psychological </v>

934
00:39:57.480 --> 00:40:00.301
<v Speaker 3>disorder and this is just not a natural </v>
<v Speaker 3>state of being like having red hair by </v>

935
00:40:00.301 --> 00:40:03.421
<v Speaker 3>the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Also I don't give a shit like I know </v>

936
00:40:03.421 --> 00:40:06.600
<v Speaker 3>that involved me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but why do you have to teach kids that </v>

937
00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:06.600
<v Speaker 3>are fighting to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

938
00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:07.360
<v Speaker 3>they go like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

939
00:40:07.361 --> 00:40:09.010
<v Speaker 3>white is considered a default.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

940
00:40:09.011 --> 00:40:14.011
<v Speaker 3>well that's because it's a majority </v>
<v Speaker 3>white population like default doesn't </v>

941
00:40:14.011 --> 00:40:15.440
<v Speaker 3>mean because I don't understand what </v>
<v Speaker 3>people are finding is by default.</v>

942
00:40:15.441 --> 00:40:16.660
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

943
00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:20.060
<v Speaker 3>Like when people go flesh colored </v>
<v Speaker 3>bandaids or white,</v>

944
00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:21.730
<v Speaker 3>which I don't even know if that's still </v>
<v Speaker 3>true,</v>

945
00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:26.760
<v Speaker 3>crown bending do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's literally a matter a matter of </v>

946
00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:29.911
<v Speaker 3>like populate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like why are you fighting to be default </v>

947
00:40:29.911 --> 00:40:31.360
<v Speaker 3>or like the boring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I became a comedian to be marginal.</v>

948
00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:33.670
<v Speaker 3>Like on the margins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want to be in the main dude.</v>

949
00:40:33.671 --> 00:40:38.671
<v Speaker 3>My gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I can't go on a fucking </v>

950
00:40:38.671 --> 00:40:38.671
<v Speaker 3>rollercoaster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well the answer the bandaid thing,</v>

951
00:40:38.671 --> 00:40:40.870
<v Speaker 3>it's very easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The time that bandaids were invented,</v>

952
00:40:40.930 --> 00:40:43.510
<v Speaker 3>it was a far greater population of white</v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

953
00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:44.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no shit.</v>

954
00:40:44.561 --> 00:40:49.561
<v Speaker 3>There's more now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like they say within 30 years why </v>

955
00:40:49.561 --> 00:40:51.640
<v Speaker 3>people are going to be the minority.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think looking forward to it.</v>

956
00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:54.380
<v Speaker 3>Why is my kid white?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know.</v>

957
00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:58.060
<v Speaker 3>Your kid is definitely not white.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And your kids half Mexican.</v>

958
00:40:58.260 --> 00:41:00.100
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I spoke this in here by the way.</v>

959
00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:00.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

960
00:41:00.850 --> 00:41:03.520
<v Speaker 3>I'd rather use marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you got going on?</v>

961
00:41:03.521 --> 00:41:07.540
<v Speaker 3>There are some little glass pipe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a chillum chill them.</v>

<v Speaker 3>But chill them.</v>

963
00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:13.070

<v Speaker 3>movie?</v>

964
00:41:13.090 --> 00:41:14.410
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's what I mean.</v>

967
00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:25.800

<v Speaker 3>that all this shit's happening because </v>

968
00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:25.800

00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:30.460
<v Speaker 3>No one's going to get a job from </v>
<v Speaker 3>underwater vagina ballet.</v>

971
00:41:30.730 --> 00:41:33.410
<v Speaker 3>The economy tanked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of a sudden there's money to be made</v>

<v Speaker 4>sell shit too.</v>

999
00:42:38.841 --> 00:42:40.490

<v Speaker 4>It isn't like a big plan.</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's just like to sell.</v>

<v Speaker 4>solved.</v>

1003
00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:53.790
<v Speaker 4>They clearly want to have the conflict </v>
<v Speaker 4>going on forever because they make a </v>

1004
00:42:53.790 --> 00:42:54.320
<v Speaker 4>living on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's people that just made,</v>

1006
00:42:56.350 --> 00:42:57.890
<v Speaker 4>the clergy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this jihadi shit.</v>

1007
00:42:58.120 --> 00:42:58.990

1012
00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:11.840
<v Speaker 4>problems,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think it's because of our instinct</v>

1013
00:43:11.841 --> 00:43:14.390
<v Speaker 4>to run away from a lion as stronger than</v>
<v Speaker 4>towards a banana.</v>

1014
00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:16.150
<v Speaker 2>I got offered an alternative point of </v>
<v Speaker 2>view.</v>

1015
00:43:16.570 --> 00:43:21.570
<v Speaker 2>Think about how often you get into </v>
<v Speaker 2>bullshit arguments online and you're a </v>

1016
00:43:21.570 --> 00:43:22.840

<v Speaker 2>children.</v>

1017
00:43:22.990 --> 00:43:27.990
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think of yourself as being 20 years old </v>

1020
00:43:33.050 --> 00:43:35.611
<v Speaker 2>down all of these points.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a natural inclination to do it and </v>

1021
00:43:35.611 --> 00:43:36.700
<v Speaker 2>it's also natural.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pick a fucking side.</v>

1022
00:43:37.090 --> 00:43:42.090
<v Speaker 2>It's natural to decide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see people aggressive in one </v>

1023
00:43:42.090 --> 00:43:44.491
<v Speaker 2>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be on the other side and </v>

1024

<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck those people.</v>

00:44:01.321 --> 00:44:06.321
<v Speaker 2>hustle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They tell you you have to do it and in </v>

1034
00:44:06.321 --> 00:44:07.230
<v Speaker 2>some jobs you do have to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you should probably think about what</v>

1035
00:44:07.231 --> 00:44:10.560
<v Speaker 2>the fuck you wanna do with your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ultimately before you do it.</v>

1036
00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:15.270
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's a bad idea to travel </v>
<v Speaker 2>overseas to experience some things,</v>

1037
00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:18.230
<v Speaker 2>take some jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then get some life experiences that,</v>

1038
00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:21.620
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm leaning towards being a this or I'm.</v>

1039
00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:25.300
<v Speaker 2>What interests me is that take the time </v>
<v Speaker 2>to find out what gender you are.</v>

1040
00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:28.020
<v Speaker 2>Don't let your out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you bounce</v>

1041
00:44:28.170 --> 00:44:33.170
<v Speaker 4>to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I spent 50 grand on a history education </v>

1042
00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:33.170
<v Speaker 4>that I could gotten from Dan Carlin</v>

<v Speaker 3>I suggest a five to one ratio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People of color makes no sense.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Nigeria and a Filipino and like a three </v>
<v Speaker 3>lock and have in common.</v>

1052

<v Speaker 3>person tweeted real recently,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a huff post editor that was </v>

1054
00:45:10.021 --> 00:45:13.431
<v Speaker 3>talking about her ultimate goal of home </v>
<v Speaker 3>runs being white or less contributions </v>

1055
00:45:15.610 --> 00:45:20.610
<v Speaker 3>being white,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more contributions by people of color </v>

1056
00:45:20.610 --> 00:45:20.880
<v Speaker 3>and women and she had like this whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>breakdown in numbers,</v>

1057
00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:25.770
<v Speaker 3>like the numbers that they've achieved </v>
<v Speaker 3>of like how there is still working on it</v>

1058
00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:27.930
<v Speaker 3>of getting rid of the white voice.</v>

1059
00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:30.060
<v Speaker 3>Just be the white guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's never done.</v>

1060
00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:35.320
<v Speaker 3>That's the bottom line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What women do so much because I don't </v>

1061
00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:39.861
<v Speaker 3>know any black people by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who all the jibberish that you here you </v>

1062
00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:44.400
<v Speaker 3>think of a single black person in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>life that has ever demanded I say any of</v>

1063
00:45:44.401 --> 00:45:49.401
<v Speaker 3>it or agree or never say shit that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're claiming 40 though.</v>

1064
00:45:49.870 --> 00:45:51.840
<v Speaker 3>So there's like people like I guess my </v>
<v Speaker 3>age and not.</v>

1065
00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:56.900
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's generational too because if you </v>

1066
00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:56.900
<v Speaker 3>were in the twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you were hanging out with 20 year old</v>

1067
00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:58.860
<v Speaker 3>kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd be experiencing this will now.</v>

1068
00:45:58.890 --> 00:46:00.860
<v Speaker 3>They went full circle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're trying to see your Dick.</v>

1069
00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:02.850
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't matter though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the racist,</v>

1070
00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:07.880
<v Speaker 3>like I can't even believe it's a point </v>
<v Speaker 3>where people with a straight face push </v>

1071
00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:10.110
<v Speaker 3>segregation under the guise of anti,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

1072
00:46:10.111 --> 00:46:12.630
<v Speaker 3>Like safe space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is a colored space.</v>

1073
00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:13.350
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1074
00:46:13.351 --> 00:46:16.230
<v Speaker 3>we had that in the fifties and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Soviet Union,</v>

1075
00:46:16.231 --> 00:46:21.231
<v Speaker 3>they do everything the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's doublespeak tolerance is </v>

1076
00:46:21.231 --> 00:46:21.630
<v Speaker 3>authoritarianism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well yeah,</v>

1077
00:46:21.631 --> 00:46:25.020
<v Speaker 3>but say it again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the opposite.</v>

1078
00:46:25.021 --> 00:46:26.880
<v Speaker 3>It's doublespeak where if you say </v>
<v Speaker 3>tolerance,</v>

1079
00:46:26.881 --> 00:46:28.460
<v Speaker 3>that means authoritarianism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1080
00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:30.390
<v Speaker 3>it's what is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it enforced tolerance?</v>

1081
00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:37.270
<v Speaker 3>It becomes like a mandatory behavior </v>
<v Speaker 3>pattern that you're supposed to like </v>

1082
00:46:37.270 --> 00:46:38.160
<v Speaker 3>hate speech is free speech because this </v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't who decides.</v>

1083
00:46:38.161 --> 00:46:43.161
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why don't you got this being a stupid </v>

1084
00:46:43.161 --> 00:46:43.161
<v Speaker 3>call I got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1085
00:46:43.161 --> 00:46:44.930
<v Speaker 3>I have an obsession like explaining to </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who haven't.</v>

1086
00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:46.860
<v Speaker 3>You heard you on the show before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't know about your job.</v>

1087
00:46:46.861 --> 00:46:48.060
<v Speaker 3>A witness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I never thought.</v>

1088
00:46:48.061 --> 00:46:49.620
<v Speaker 3>I never thought of it as a cult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Honestly.</v>

1089
00:46:49.621 --> 00:46:52.200
<v Speaker 3>I never called them a call and I never </v>
<v Speaker 3>really had an anger towards it.</v>

1090
00:46:52.201 --> 00:46:54.090
<v Speaker 3>But when I think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1091
00:46:54.091 --> 00:46:56.260
<v Speaker 3>they didn't help.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It didn't help my fucking family.</v>

1092
00:46:56.260 --> 00:46:58.230
<v Speaker 3>And only hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing with these religions,</v>

1093
00:46:58.231 --> 00:47:00.080
<v Speaker 3>they never help.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what they should also seeds.</v>

1094
00:47:00.090 --> 00:47:05.090
<v Speaker 3>Some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some religions I think can help certain </v>

1095
00:47:05.090 --> 00:47:05.090
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe they don't.</v>

1096
00:47:05.090 --> 00:47:07.020
<v Speaker 3>Especially men's helped nicest people on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the planet.</v>

1097
00:47:07.230 --> 00:47:12.230
<v Speaker 3>What I'm saying is the parts that helped</v>
<v Speaker 3>were parts I didn't need the religion </v>

1098
00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:12.230
<v Speaker 3>for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You didn't,</v>

1099
00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:15.090
<v Speaker 3>but you haven't accelerated in mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw people have their lie.</v>

<v Speaker 3>And then uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>sudden you got new teeth and they were </v>

<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1107

<v Speaker 4>when you were under that truck,</v>

1111
00:47:36.790 --> 00:47:40.210
<v Speaker 4>so when you were in that accident did </v>
<v Speaker 4>contemplate like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>

1113
00:47:45.211 --> 00:47:47.371
<v Speaker 4>be going to hell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't even have time for that until </v>

<v Speaker 4>did something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like it was so out of my hands.</v>

1118
00:47:58.691 --> 00:48:00.610
<v Speaker 4>That was comforting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I don't even know why she didn't tell </v>
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>

1146
00:49:02.621 --> 00:49:03.510
<v Speaker 4>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't want to tell him.</v>

1147
00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:04.360
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't care.</v>

1148
00:49:04.690 --> 00:49:08.100
<v Speaker 4>But she got caught and had to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>community service I think in like Harlan</v>

1149
00:49:08.110 --> 00:49:13.110
<v Speaker 4>and she was afraid to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she said like people are walking up </v>

1150
00:49:13.110 --> 00:49:15.301
<v Speaker 4>and thanking her for like picking up </v>
<v Speaker 4>trash with the orange vest because </v>

1151
00:49:15.301 --> 00:49:17.050
<v Speaker 4>people just skip out on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Once you do the service,</v>

1152
00:49:17.051 --> 00:49:18.920
<v Speaker 4>they wipe it from your record.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Basically they offer.</v>

1153
00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:24.000
<v Speaker 4>It's like you get caught,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're offered a way back where you </v>

1154
00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:24.000
<v Speaker 4>don't have it on your record.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's on mark it.</v>

1155
00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:26.590
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing that could work for </v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody that's not going to be like,</v>

1156
00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:28.030
<v Speaker 4>so religion has that.</v>

1157
00:49:28.030 --> 00:49:29.530
<v Speaker 4>If I wanted to go back and meet job as </v>
<v Speaker 4>witness,</v>

1158
00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:30.280
<v Speaker 4>I could go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>

1159
00:49:30.281 --> 00:49:31.020
<v Speaker 4>I was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1160
00:49:31.021 --> 00:49:33.610
<v Speaker 4>I missed being part of the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>

1161
00:49:33.611 --> 00:49:35.320
<v Speaker 4>blah blah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I can get back in.</v>

1162
00:49:35.590 --> 00:49:40.590
<v Speaker 4>These people have created a religion </v>
<v Speaker 4>where they catch you in some minor </v>

1163
00:49:40.590 --> 00:49:43.861
<v Speaker 4>mistake and they throw you into your </v>
<v Speaker 4>advantage to Kramer island or whatever </v>

1164
00:49:43.861 --> 00:49:48.300
<v Speaker 4>and they're fucking proud of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the only way you can move ahead as </v>

1165
00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:50.660
<v Speaker 4>to catch someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's much worse than religion because</v>

1166
00:49:50.690 --> 00:49:53.230
<v Speaker 4>there's no love or forgiveness of any </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind.</v>

1167
00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:56.980
<v Speaker 4>It's this empty button.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only thing that matters is your part</v>

1168
00:49:56.981 --> 00:49:58.450
<v Speaker 4>of the right identity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1169
00:49:58.451 --> 00:50:00.640
<v Speaker 4>it's basically just the racism as </v>
<v Speaker 4>religion,</v>

1170
00:50:00.910 --> 00:50:05.910
<v Speaker 4>but they use shame and that's why the </v>
<v Speaker 4>only way out of it is to not care </v>

1171
00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:09.511
<v Speaker 4>because shame is the only way to control</v>
<v Speaker 4>people are your biggest ways you could </v>

1172
00:50:09.511 --> 00:50:10.070
<v Speaker 4>control the other way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1173
00:50:10.071 --> 00:50:10.550
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For the,</v>

1174
00:50:10.580 --> 00:50:12.760
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the social justice warrior religion,</v>

1175
00:50:12.790 --> 00:50:16.360
<v Speaker 4>like the way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's important.</v>

1176
00:50:16.390 --> 00:50:18.260
<v Speaker 4>What you're saying is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1177
00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:20.120
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is the files,</v>

1178
00:50:20.140 --> 00:50:22.630
<v Speaker 4>the same sort of patterns that these </v>
<v Speaker 4>benches and find Jesus,</v>

1179
00:50:22.631 --> 00:50:26.580
<v Speaker 4>it'd be happier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No gluten free.</v>

1180
00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:28.470
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh fuck.</v>

1181
00:50:29.310 --> 00:50:34.310
<v Speaker 2>It's like what you experienced as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jehovah witnesses the same thing like </v>

1182
00:50:34.310 --> 00:50:35.350
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we were talking before you got here</v>

1183
00:50:35.351 --> 00:50:40.351
<v Speaker 2>about them trying to cancel Jordan </v>
<v Speaker 2>Peterson speeches and these people were </v>

1184
00:50:40.351 --> 00:50:41.380
<v Speaker 2>sending these emails and professors were</v>
<v Speaker 2>sending emails,</v>

1185
00:50:41.620 --> 00:50:46.620
<v Speaker 2>calling him a racist and a Nazi and </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying he's a fascist and all these </v>

1186
00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:51.421
<v Speaker 2>different things like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what I'm saying is that when you </v>

1187
00:50:51.421 --> 00:50:52.190
<v Speaker 2>ramp up the fake reality to the point </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you,</v>

1188
00:50:52.250 --> 00:50:53.980
<v Speaker 2>you're saying things you know aren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>true,</v>

1189
00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:59.180
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think you're thinking of doing it </v>

1190
00:50:59.180 --> 00:50:59.180
<v Speaker 2>for the right reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a purpose.</v>

1191
00:50:59.180 --> 00:51:02.040
<v Speaker 2>They do it purposely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think they're doing it for the </v>

1192
00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:02.040
<v Speaker 2>right reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if they really aren't,</v>

1193
00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:05.320
<v Speaker 2>they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've really not a fan of Jordan </v>

1194
00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:07.590
<v Speaker 2>Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would realize how crazy it is to </v>

1195
00:51:07.590 --> 00:51:09.121
<v Speaker 2>say he's racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How crazy it is to say he's transphobic </v>

1196
00:51:09.121 --> 00:51:12.270
<v Speaker 2>or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not a Nazi by any stretch of the </v>

1197
00:51:12.270 --> 00:51:12.520
<v Speaker 2>imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he just doesn't tolerate nonsense.</v>

1198
00:51:12.521 --> 00:51:15.670
<v Speaker 2>It's all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want nonsense of course.</v>

1199
00:51:15.671 --> 00:51:18.160
<v Speaker 2>So they're proving him right by calling </v>
<v Speaker 2>him a Nazi.</v>

1200
00:51:18.410 --> 00:51:18.890
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1201
00:51:19.210 --> 00:51:19.980
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>

1202
00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:25.040
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is why I think it'll just burn </v>

1203
00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:25.040
<v Speaker 4>itself out eventually because.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No Man,</v>

1204
00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:26.360
<v Speaker 4>you can't keep throwing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They throw people,</v>

1205
00:51:26.361 --> 00:51:29.570
<v Speaker 4>they throw their people away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You add Jamie Kilstein on recently.</v>

1206
00:51:29.860 --> 00:51:31.020
<v Speaker 4>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never will.</v>

1207
00:51:31.021 --> 00:51:33.200
<v Speaker 4>They stick around like the hunchback and</v>
<v Speaker 4>300,</v>

1208
00:51:33.201 --> 00:51:33.620
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're like,</v>

1209
00:51:33.621 --> 00:51:35.570
<v Speaker 4>can I get back in?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't,</v>

1210
00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:38.350
<v Speaker 4>they don't really feel that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know that guy from.</v>

1211
00:51:38.380 --> 00:51:39.500
<v Speaker 4>I started comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1212
00:51:40.090 --> 00:51:45.090
<v Speaker 4>And Jamie was always like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I talked with like a while ago </v>

1213
00:51:45.090 --> 00:51:45.090
<v Speaker 4>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was like,</v>

1214
00:51:45.090 --> 00:51:49.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was always a dude that felt small </v>

1215
00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:51.550
<v Speaker 4>that it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always got the impression his </v>

1216
00:51:51.550 --> 00:51:51.550
<v Speaker 4>girlfriend made up most of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most of,</v>

1217
00:51:51.550 --> 00:51:55.060
<v Speaker 4>most of him when I knew him that he met </v>
<v Speaker 4>this girl he was married to and she put </v>

1218
00:51:55.060 --> 00:51:58.811
<v Speaker 4>all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She turned him into who he was because </v>

1219
00:51:58.811 --> 00:51:59.220
<v Speaker 4>he just like a low self esteem dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

1220
00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:01.580
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I can relate to that.</v>

1221
00:52:01.730 --> 00:52:03.530
<v Speaker 4>I can relate to a lie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that shit of where someone's like,</v>

1222
00:52:03.531 --> 00:52:08.531
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody feels bad and they want to be </v>

1223
00:52:08.531 --> 00:52:08.531
<v Speaker 4>part of a group,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's what I'm just fascinated by.</v>

1224
00:52:08.531 --> 00:52:09.290
<v Speaker 4>How do you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for yourself?</v>

1225
00:52:09.291 --> 00:52:14.291
<v Speaker 4>Like how do you make old?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he's telling me all his personal </v>

1226
00:52:14.291 --> 00:52:17.201
<v Speaker 4>experience like Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some shit I won't share it with like he </v>

1227
00:52:17.201 --> 00:52:19.241
<v Speaker 4>can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it sounded like being in a fucking </v>

1228
00:52:19.241 --> 00:52:19.640
<v Speaker 4>religion and like when it went like </v>
<v Speaker 4>dirty tests,</v>

1229
00:52:19.641 --> 00:52:24.641
<v Speaker 4>there's literally like purity tests.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you heard outside ideas you better </v>

1230
00:52:24.641 --> 00:52:26.990
<v Speaker 4>not to listen to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It sounded so much like we were supposed</v>

1231
00:52:26.991 --> 00:52:30.650
<v Speaker 4>to guard our hearts and like not even </v>
<v Speaker 4>read certain things.</v>

1232
00:52:30.651 --> 00:52:35.651
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if we had doubts not say them </v>

1233
00:52:35.651 --> 00:52:39.311
<v Speaker 4>because you might stumble your brother </v>
<v Speaker 4>out of the faith and that's the worst </v>

1234
00:52:39.311 --> 00:52:39.830
<v Speaker 4>thing there is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1235
00:52:39.831 --> 00:52:44.831
<v Speaker 4>just put the question side because God </v>
<v Speaker 4>forbid you say something to put stout </v>

1236
00:52:44.831 --> 00:52:44.840
<v Speaker 4>and Owen and then he falls out of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>truth.</v>

1237
00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:48.060
<v Speaker 4>It's a clever little tactic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they all do isolated.</v>

1238
00:52:48.100 --> 00:52:53.100
<v Speaker 4>The reason they got to crack down on </v>
<v Speaker 4>bullshit like comedy or whatever the </v>

1239
00:52:53.100 --> 00:52:54.740
<v Speaker 4>fuck or your facebook or who give.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you give a shit about something,</v>

1240
00:52:54.741 --> 00:52:57.740
<v Speaker 4>somebody tweeted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you must be fucking stupid,</v>

1241
00:52:57.741 --> 00:53:02.741
<v Speaker 4>but that's all of them ever hurts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cognitive dissonance hurts where it's </v>

1242
00:53:02.741 --> 00:53:03.430
<v Speaker 4>like Donald Trump is Hitler.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now give them all your guns.</v>

1243
00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:07.210
<v Speaker 4>Then like that hurts your brain and so </v>
<v Speaker 4>when someone shows you,</v>

1244
00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:08.210
<v Speaker 4>say that again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry.</v>

1245
00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:14.030
<v Speaker 4>Smoking Pot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of these same people have been all</v>

1246
00:53:14.220 --> 00:53:19.220
<v Speaker 4>year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have been trying to convince everyone </v>

1247
00:53:19.220 --> 00:53:19.220
<v Speaker 4>that donald trump's being run by the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Russians and he's Adolf Hitler,</v>

1248
00:53:19.220 --> 00:53:21.680
<v Speaker 4>and then the government should have all </v>
<v Speaker 4>your guns.</v>

1249
00:53:22.230 --> 00:53:26.040
<v Speaker 4>It's the same as being pro free market,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but not acknowledging you're so stupid.</v>

1250
00:53:27.420 --> 00:53:29.700
<v Speaker 4>Both of us did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've certainly smoked myself.</v>

1251
00:53:29.701 --> 00:53:31.540
<v Speaker 4>Stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Donald trump is.</v>

1252
00:53:31.550 --> 00:53:32.640
<v Speaker 4>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's the guy.</v>

1253
00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:33.990
<v Speaker 4>He's the perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

1254
00:53:33.991 --> 00:53:36.480
<v Speaker 4>the perfect president of America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is.</v>

1255
00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:41.660
<v Speaker 4>There's never been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I mean for whatever party or in he </v>

1256
00:53:41.660 --> 00:53:41.660
<v Speaker 4>is your Avatar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1257
00:53:41.660 --> 00:53:43.260

1259
00:53:46.470 --> 00:53:49.500

<v Speaker 4>like I could probably do that better.</v>

<v Speaker 4>About whether or not she's really native</v>

1289
00:55:04.741 --> 00:55:07.320
<v Speaker 4>American.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She brought it up for.</v>

1290
00:55:07.930 --> 00:55:10.370
<v Speaker 4>She took a job,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like she robbed these job.</v>

<v Speaker 4>She got like one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She got a scholarship for being native </v>

1293
00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:18.080
<v Speaker 4>American.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She got a scholarship to how much native</v>

1294
00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:20.960
<v Speaker 4>American and she pulled the Shaun King </v>
<v Speaker 4>one 32nd.</v>

1295
00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:22.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you have to understand something,</v>

1296
00:55:22.730 --> 00:55:23.800
<v Speaker 4>and I didn't know this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1297
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:27.120
<v Speaker 4>that should have blood quantum native </v>
<v Speaker 4>Americans didn't have.</v>

1298
00:55:27.270 --> 00:55:29.060
<v Speaker 4>You could be fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I'm,</v>

1299
00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:31.440
<v Speaker 4>let's say I'm a chief and I just adopt </v>
<v Speaker 4>your Rogan.</v>

1300
00:55:31.650 --> 00:55:36.650
<v Speaker 4>Joe Rogan is my son.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He is now 100 percent part of my thing </v>

1301
00:55:36.650 --> 00:55:36.650
<v Speaker 4>no matter what.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His blood.</v>

1302
00:55:36.650 --> 00:55:40.140
<v Speaker 4>They didn't get hung up on that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That came about to divvy up benefits,</v>

1303
00:55:40.500 --> 00:55:42.810
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>after we like the real evil shit.</v>

1304
00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:45.720
<v Speaker 4>We did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The natives was modern times back then.</v>

1305
00:55:45.721 --> 00:55:50.721
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's what everybody did back </v>

1306
00:55:50.721 --> 00:55:50.721
<v Speaker 4>then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't give a fuck,</v>

1307
00:55:50.721 --> 00:55:50.721
<v Speaker 4>but in modern times you're absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 4>right dude.</v>

1308
00:55:50.721 --> 00:55:52.280
<v Speaker 4>But in modern times he did some very </v>
<v Speaker 4>evil shit with them.</v>

1309
00:55:52.740 --> 00:55:55.530
<v Speaker 4>The blood quantum,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was what they're kind of cool about</v>

1310
00:55:55.531 --> 00:55:56.180
<v Speaker 4>the most,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1311
00:55:56.190 --> 00:56:01.190
<v Speaker 4>most native nations is they didn't get </v>
<v Speaker 4>hung up on your amount of blood when </v>

1312
00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:03.210
<v Speaker 4>you're in the family.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so you could be one like Johnny Depp</v>

1313
00:56:03.211 --> 00:56:05.610
<v Speaker 4>when he said he got brought in the tribe</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we could play Toronto.</v>

1314
00:56:06.060 --> 00:56:09.480
<v Speaker 4>That's a legit thing in traditionally in</v>
<v Speaker 4>native America,</v>

1315
00:56:09.481 --> 00:56:11.840
<v Speaker 4>they were much cooler about racial shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1316
00:56:11.870 --> 00:56:14.160
<v Speaker 4>like Europeans kind of brought that </v>
<v Speaker 4>nonsense over more,</v>

1317
00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:18.720
<v Speaker 4>but a kidnap people and people would </v>
<v Speaker 4>stay with them.</v>

1318
00:56:18.750 --> 00:56:23.750
<v Speaker 4>They better vibe the Sebastian younger </v>
<v Speaker 4>detailed how many</v>

1319
00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:28.180
<v Speaker 1>people would leave Western society and </v>
<v Speaker 1>joined the native Americans.</v>

1320
00:56:28.340 --> 00:56:30.970
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know how much it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like separate countries.</v>

1321
00:56:30.971 --> 00:56:35.971
<v Speaker 1>See if they teach American history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what they should start at the </v>

1322
00:56:35.971 --> 00:56:38.941
<v Speaker 1>very first whatever countries were here </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then just move up through American </v>

1323
00:56:38.941 --> 00:56:39.010
<v Speaker 1>because it's thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit,</v>

1324
00:56:39.220 --> 00:56:40.750
<v Speaker 1>count them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't even count today.</v>

1325
00:56:40.780 --> 00:56:43.910
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I didn't know how populated it was.</v>

1326
00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:49.080
<v Speaker 1>Like two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were considered fauna in Canada </v>

1327
00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:49.080
<v Speaker 1>until the sixties or it might've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia,</v>

1328
00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:50.520
<v Speaker 1>but they were considered like fauna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1329
00:56:50.750 --> 00:56:54.120
<v Speaker 1>well I might be insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia.</v>

1330
00:56:54.190 --> 00:56:55.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia.</v>

1331
00:56:55.540 --> 00:56:57.400
<v Speaker 1>The aborigines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a terrible story.</v>

1332
00:56:57.401 --> 00:57:02.401
<v Speaker 1>They.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They was in the 19 I saw quickly and </v>

1333
00:57:02.401 --> 00:57:05.161
<v Speaker 1>under guys kidnapped the average new </v>
<v Speaker 1>babies and made them raised by white </v>

1334
00:57:05.161 --> 00:57:09.271
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They took the babies from aboriginal </v>

1335
00:57:09.271 --> 00:57:09.271
<v Speaker 1>families.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1336
00:57:09.271 --> 00:57:09.271
<v Speaker 1>where'd you get that baby?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1337
00:57:09.271 --> 00:57:09.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1338
00:57:09.310 --> 00:57:12.880
<v Speaker 1>They did it like a concerted effort that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to try to create the.</v>

1339
00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:15.740
<v Speaker 1>They decided they were going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>symbolize people.</v>

1340
00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:18.830
<v Speaker 1>I had my buddy Adam green tree lives </v>
<v Speaker 1>over there and it'll show it.</v>

1341
00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:23.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's born and raised and he works in </v>

1342
00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:26.641
<v Speaker 1>mining companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he deals with all these different </v>

1343
00:57:26.641 --> 00:57:26.641
<v Speaker 1>aborigines and they all have different </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>

1344
00:57:26.710 --> 00:57:31.710
<v Speaker 1>They call them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're called a mob like instead of a </v>

1345
00:57:31.710 --> 00:57:32.890
<v Speaker 1>clan or a town,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they call themselves a mob.</v>

1346
00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:33.580
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1347
00:57:33.581 --> 00:57:37.120
<v Speaker 1>and they have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might have a totally different name</v>

1348
00:57:37.121 --> 00:57:40.150
<v Speaker 1>for things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a guy that lives five miles away,</v>

1349
00:57:40.840 --> 00:57:45.840
<v Speaker 1>five miles away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of totally different </v>

1350
00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:45.840
<v Speaker 1>names and those people stick to </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

1351
00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:48.100
<v Speaker 1>These people stick to their selves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the bands of them,</v>

1352
00:57:48.101 --> 00:57:50.170
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of them all over the place and </v>
<v Speaker 1>these.</v>

1353
00:57:50.260 --> 00:57:53.320
<v Speaker 1>All these different languages are all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the losing all of them.</v>

1354
00:57:53.530 --> 00:57:58.530
<v Speaker 1>They're going to lose all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages if these people get </v>

1355
00:57:58.530 --> 00:57:59.110
<v Speaker 1>assimilated because they're not really </v>
<v Speaker 1>written down in a lot of cases.</v>

1356
00:58:00.380 --> 00:58:03.340
<v Speaker 1>Do you see that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was on some fucking discovery.</v>

1357
00:58:03.341 --> 00:58:05.230
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you know one of them fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

1358
00:58:05.231 --> 00:58:10.231
<v Speaker 1>but the oldest human language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think his case on people that got </v>

1359
00:58:10.231 --> 00:58:12.320
<v Speaker 1>wiped out by the Zulus back in the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Shaka Zulu conquered them,</v>

1360
00:58:12.610 --> 00:58:17.610
<v Speaker 1>but the case on their language is like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the oldest thing they can find a k,</v>

1361
00:58:18.600 --> 00:58:21.040
<v Speaker 1>a e song son Jay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

1362
00:58:21.070 --> 00:58:22.990
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the old thing,</v>

1363
00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:26.350
<v Speaker 1>there's this old ass lady who knew </v>
<v Speaker 1>something about like the word and it was</v>

1364
00:58:26.351 --> 00:58:27.280
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

1365
00:58:27.510 --> 00:58:29.320
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they come from animal noises,</v>

1366
00:58:29.321 --> 00:58:34.321
<v Speaker 1>like the lion goes bra.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the words they got came from </v>

1367
00:58:34.321 --> 00:58:34.540
<v Speaker 1>mimicking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was interesting as fuck.</v>

1368
00:58:34.541 --> 00:58:36.010
<v Speaker 1>But it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1369
00:58:36.011 --> 00:58:38.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's such cradle of civilization shit.</v>

1370
00:58:39.130 --> 00:58:41.480
<v Speaker 1>But the case song I think,</v>

1450
01:02:08.570 --> 01:02:12.860
<v Speaker 3>that UCB has determined guilt in a rape </v>
<v Speaker 3>case like nearly suggested.</v>

<v Speaker 3>indycar.</v>

1457
01:02:27.150 --> 01:02:29.820
<v Speaker 3>I just want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want people to understand the story.</v>

1458
01:02:29.821 --> 01:02:34.821
<v Speaker 3>There was a guy that was accused of rape</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you had decided like they shouldn't </v>

1459
01:02:34.821 --> 01:02:37.810
<v Speaker 3>be tried in the court of public opinion </v>
<v Speaker 3>on social media and what you said is why</v>

1460
01:02:38.570 --> 01:02:39.820
<v Speaker 3>humorous wind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

1461
01:02:39.860 --> 01:02:42.270
<v Speaker 3>nothing with my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody now not even defending him.</v>

1462
01:02:42.750 --> 01:02:47.750
<v Speaker 3>I'm defending any but like how is this </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking cool that this is going to be </v>

1463
01:02:47.750 --> 01:02:50.160
<v Speaker 3>tried on fucking facebook?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone's sending random message.</v>

1464
01:02:50.710 --> 01:02:55.710
<v Speaker 3>So and so has been found a ucb that </v>
<v Speaker 3>noted clown college has done an internal</v>

1465
01:02:56.431 --> 01:02:58.920
<v Speaker 3>investigation and term and so and so is </v>
<v Speaker 3>guilty of rape.</v>

1466
01:02:59.610 --> 01:03:01.650
<v Speaker 3>So if you have any information come in </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's on facebook.</v>

1467
01:03:02.130 --> 01:03:06.150
<v Speaker 3>Did they really say it that way?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was first in an online woman group.</v>

1468
01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:08.190
<v Speaker 3>Then it got leaked onto regular </v>
<v Speaker 3>facebook,</v>

1469
01:03:08.350 --> 01:03:12.370
<v Speaker 3>but as a representative of the UCB that </v>
<v Speaker 3>said that they didn't.</v>

1470
01:03:12.650 --> 01:03:16.500
<v Speaker 3>It was some fucking girl on her own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I found out that's a big difference.</v>

1471
01:03:16.501 --> 01:03:17.760
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like she said,</v>

1472
01:03:17.910 --> 01:03:21.390
<v Speaker 3>the umbrella of UCB.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did she do it under the UCB twitter page</v>

1473
01:03:21.391 --> 01:03:23.280
<v Speaker 3>or facebook page or other?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea.</v>

1474
01:03:23.281 --> 01:03:25.260
<v Speaker 3>It was from twitter or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever it is.</v>

1475
01:03:25.261 --> 01:03:26.260
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she could have just been.</v>

1476
01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:27.810
<v Speaker 3>I saw thought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1477
01:03:27.811 --> 01:03:29.220
<v Speaker 3>chase page.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't even a thing.</v>

1478
01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:34.670
<v Speaker 3>The problem is if you're saying the UCB </v>
<v Speaker 3>did it and they didn't know they did </v>

1479
01:03:35.011 --> 01:03:36.740
<v Speaker 3>not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They did not.</v>

1480
01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:38.610
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She said that she said,</v>

1481
01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:42.750
<v Speaker 3>but you said that you see be determined </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it was.</v>

1482
01:03:43.140 --> 01:03:44.970
<v Speaker 3>I saw a post that said that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

1483
01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.370
<v Speaker 3>and this is from a person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she said it.</v>

1484
01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:48.870
<v Speaker 3>The UCB didn't say it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1485
01:03:48.871 --> 01:03:50.250
<v Speaker 3>it's not their official word at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1486
01:03:50.270 --> 01:03:51.590
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's just a personal,</v>

1487
01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:56.780
<v Speaker 3>very clear about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They never claimed that it was a person </v>

1488
01:03:56.780 --> 01:04:00.021
<v Speaker 3>who I think was like a rape counselor or</v>
<v Speaker 3>something or somebody had to deal with </v>

1489
01:04:00.021 --> 01:04:00.021
<v Speaker 3>like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch of like a rapey job.</v>

1490
01:04:00.030 --> 01:04:03.550
<v Speaker 3>So something happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>performers,</v>

1491
01:04:03.690 --> 01:04:08.690
<v Speaker 3>something happened between performance </v>
<v Speaker 3>and this one guy was being accused and </v>

1492
01:04:08.690 --> 01:04:11.520
<v Speaker 3>you said he just real simple without </v>
<v Speaker 3>knowing who's guilty or not.</v>

1493
01:04:11.630 --> 01:04:14.130
<v Speaker 3>You said he shouldn't be trying to call.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's what happened.</v>

1494
01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:17.430
<v Speaker 3>A guy that opened for me somewhere with </v>
<v Speaker 3>friends with I go,</v>

1495
01:04:17.431 --> 01:04:19.140
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can he call you now?</v>

1496
01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:21.290
<v Speaker 3>First question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why call me right?</v>

1497
01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:24.060
<v Speaker 3>What am I a noted rape investigator on </v>
<v Speaker 3>facebook?</v>

1498
01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:25.960
<v Speaker 3>I think just because I was somebody </v>
<v Speaker 3>yelled,</v>

1499
01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:28.080
<v Speaker 3>this is me not being aware of what to </v>
<v Speaker 3>build it up.</v>

1500
01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:30.750
<v Speaker 3>I would just yell out on facebook about </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff and I had a following.</v>

1501
01:04:31.050 --> 01:04:33.090
<v Speaker 3>So it's almost like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1502
01:04:33.091 --> 01:04:35.850
<v Speaker 3>like a can you talk to you and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>throw your weight behind?</v>

1503
01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:37.200
<v Speaker 3>I think it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eh,</v>

1504
01:04:37.430 --> 01:04:38.400
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1505
01:04:38.490 --> 01:04:40.860
<v Speaker 3>I didn't look at it as shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>facebook like that.</v>

1506
01:04:40.861 --> 01:04:45.861
<v Speaker 3>Like it was like not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand like how people were </v>

1507
01:04:45.861 --> 01:04:47.340
<v Speaker 3>looking at my facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's ridiculous.</v>

1508
01:04:47.341 --> 01:04:52.341
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I talked to the guy on the phone and he </v>

1509
01:04:52.341 --> 01:04:53.430
<v Speaker 3>told me something I think was a lie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1510
01:04:53.470 --> 01:04:54.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously I can't say one or the other,</v>

1511
01:04:54.841 --> 01:04:59.841
<v Speaker 3>but looking back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think when he told me was a lie that </v>

1512
01:04:59.841 --> 01:04:59.841
<v Speaker 3>people were accusing them because he </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't book them on a show,</v>

1513
01:04:59.850 --> 01:05:04.100
<v Speaker 3>which just doesn't really make a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense so much.</v>

1514
01:05:04.101 --> 01:05:07.120
<v Speaker 3>And with that quick to pull the trigger </v>
<v Speaker 3>on a rate back,</v>

1515
01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:10.490
<v Speaker 3>how evil they would have to be booked </v>
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>

1516
01:05:10.590 --> 01:05:14.200
<v Speaker 3>he fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That accusation.</v>

1517
01:05:14.270 --> 01:05:19.270
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't believe they would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>involved in comedy but that at once </v>

1518
01:05:19.270 --> 01:05:19.270
<v Speaker 3>together</v>

1519
01:05:19.270 --> 01:05:20.320
<v Speaker 4>at eight minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>

1520
01:05:20.321 --> 01:05:22.120
<v Speaker 4>make a 10 or else we got rape on our </v>
<v Speaker 4>hands.</v>

1521
01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:27.800
<v Speaker 4>So my point was just used guilty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is worse because what you've done </v>

1522
01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:29.530
<v Speaker 4>is handed somebody a lawsuit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't defame someone like that.</v>

1523
01:05:29.531 --> 01:05:31.750
<v Speaker 4>And it's like you can just get sued for </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1524
01:05:32.180 --> 01:05:37.180
<v Speaker 4>And also this is just to be convicted </v>
<v Speaker 4>before you're allowed to say that </v>

1525
01:05:37.180 --> 01:05:38.050
<v Speaker 4>legally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But to me it's not.</v>

1526
01:05:38.110 --> 01:05:43.110
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like they're taking the campus </v>

1527
01:05:43.110 --> 01:05:44.671
<v Speaker 4>thing of like where we're going to have </v>
<v Speaker 4>a college campus say kick you out of </v>

1528
01:05:44.671 --> 01:05:44.671
<v Speaker 4>school for that rape.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You committed,</v>

1529
01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:48.910
<v Speaker 4>talk over each other,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's hard.</v>

1530
01:05:48.911 --> 01:05:53.911
<v Speaker 4>That's not a punishment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not a punishment for rape is you </v>

1531
01:05:53.911 --> 01:05:54.250
<v Speaker 4>get kicked out of school.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is gender studies.</v>

1532
01:05:54.251 --> 01:05:56.500
<v Speaker 4>Bullshit trickling down into real life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1533
01:05:56.710 --> 01:05:59.590
<v Speaker 4>So the colleges I assume wet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let that,</v>

1534
01:05:59.740 --> 01:06:04.740
<v Speaker 4>let that go on because they don't want </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be known as a school where your </v>

1535
01:06:04.740 --> 01:06:04.740
<v Speaker 4>daughter could get raped.</v>

1536
01:06:04.740 --> 01:06:08.220
<v Speaker 4>So they let these little groups pretend </v>
<v Speaker 4>to have power and do a little tribunal </v>

1537
01:06:08.220 --> 01:06:11.940
<v Speaker 4>and then everybody's happy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But we want to know what a rapist got </v>

1538
01:06:11.940 --> 01:06:11.940
<v Speaker 4>expelled.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's their punishment.</v>

1539
01:06:11.940 --> 01:06:16.160
<v Speaker 4>Great job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It sounds like the Catholic church </v>

1540
01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:16.160
<v Speaker 4>transferring people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't sound any different.</v>

1541
01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:20.010
<v Speaker 4>So this is someone to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So to me that was just like a garbage </v>

1542
01:06:20.010 --> 01:06:20.010
<v Speaker 4>ass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If this guy's dangerous,</v>

1543
01:06:20.010 --> 01:06:21.700
<v Speaker 4>go to the fucking cops.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1544
01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:24.010
<v Speaker 4>so uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then I'm getting all this.</v>

1545
01:06:24.011 --> 01:06:27.430
<v Speaker 4>People come to me about like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't you dare tell a victim to go,</v>

1546
01:06:27.610 --> 01:06:29.290
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're a victim yet though.</v>

1547
01:06:29.590 --> 01:06:31.780
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when a victim says you're a victim,</v>

1548
01:06:31.930 --> 01:06:33.910
<v Speaker 4>if you don't believe them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're calling them a liar.</v>

1549
01:06:34.090 --> 01:06:37.120
<v Speaker 4>We have to make sure you are a victim </v>
<v Speaker 4>before we say one way or the other.</v>

1550
01:06:37.121 --> 01:06:41.080
<v Speaker 4>So we're getting ahead of ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But this is just basic due process shit.</v>

1551
01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:46.320
<v Speaker 4>I guess the argument is because </v>
<v Speaker 4>historically this is like the argument </v>

1552
01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:47.650
<v Speaker 4>on coming against me from finishing a </v>
<v Speaker 4>historically,</v>

1553
01:06:47.651 --> 01:06:49.690
<v Speaker 4>women are not believed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1554
01:06:49.780 --> 01:06:52.420
<v Speaker 4>which by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by who other women.</v>

1555
01:06:52.450 --> 01:06:56.110
<v Speaker 4>Because what my experience is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is any woman close to me,</v>

1556
01:06:56.111 --> 01:07:01.111
<v Speaker 4>they'd say she got raped.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I probably believer and every man I </v>

1557
01:07:01.111 --> 01:07:01.330
<v Speaker 4>know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In fact I know women that get dudes into</v>

1558
01:07:01.331 --> 01:07:03.790
<v Speaker 4>fights over shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Especially if you're in like white trash</v>

1559
01:07:03.791 --> 01:07:08.120
<v Speaker 4>town where I grew up around like women </v>
<v Speaker 4>are the ones that don't believe women.</v>

1560
01:07:08.150 --> 01:07:10.870
<v Speaker 4>Men are the only people stupid enough to</v>
<v Speaker 4>believe women most of the time.</v>

1561
01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:16.080
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's already a bullshit thing that </v>

1562
01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:16.080
<v Speaker 4>women aren't believed we.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's lynching.</v>

1563
01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:20.910
<v Speaker 4>Rosewood,</v>
<v Speaker 4>remember that shit that was [inaudible] </v>

1564
01:07:20.910 --> 01:07:20.910
<v Speaker 4>a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a white woman was just believed.</v>

1565
01:07:20.910 --> 01:07:21.890
<v Speaker 4>And then there's a bunch of lynchings of</v>
<v Speaker 4>black people was.</v>

1566
01:07:21.891 --> 01:07:26.891
<v Speaker 4>I think there's got to be instances we </v>
<v Speaker 4>should be very measured about this </v>

1567
01:07:26.891 --> 01:07:27.640
<v Speaker 4>because it's got to be instances in </v>
<v Speaker 4>which women weren't believed.</v>

1568
01:07:27.700 --> 01:07:30.460
<v Speaker 4>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Full spectrum has nothing to do.</v>

1569
01:07:31.230 --> 01:07:33.270
<v Speaker 4>The idea is that you can't believe him </v>
<v Speaker 4>every time.</v>

1570
01:07:33.310 --> 01:07:37.000
<v Speaker 4>The larger point is you'd have to look </v>
<v Speaker 4>at it as an individual case.</v>

1571
01:07:37.090 --> 01:07:40.450
<v Speaker 4>Every case is individual and you look at</v>
<v Speaker 4>it on it because that's fair.</v>

1572
01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:45.600
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's say no woman in history has ever </v>

1573
01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:46.000
<v Speaker 4>lied about rape once.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1574
01:07:46.001 --> 01:07:49.030
<v Speaker 4>you still have to have due process in </v>
<v Speaker 4>case it happens once.</v>

1575
01:07:49.270 --> 01:07:52.750
<v Speaker 4>I'm not getting sacrificed to the state </v>
<v Speaker 4>for the good of the fucking.</v>

1576
01:07:52.780 --> 01:07:54.120
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it had shit happens,</v>

1577
01:07:54.121 --> 01:07:59.121
<v Speaker 4>it does happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It happens when you have something to </v>

1578
01:07:59.121 --> 01:08:01.870
<v Speaker 4>lose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you're famous custody cases,</v>

1579
01:08:02.230 --> 01:08:03.400
<v Speaker 4>rape case.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1580
01:08:03.401 --> 01:08:06.750
<v Speaker 4>and news stories of this going </v>
<v Speaker 4>uncritically believed when,</v>

1581
01:08:07.070 --> 01:08:12.070
<v Speaker 4>when by the way with someone not </v>
<v Speaker 4>believed in the media and and it turned </v>

1582
01:08:12.070 --> 01:08:16.021
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see a lot of people getting believed </v>

1583
01:08:16.021 --> 01:08:16.021
<v Speaker 4>who lot.</v>

1584
01:08:16.021 --> 01:08:16.021
<v Speaker 4>None of it matters though because like I</v>
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>

1585
01:08:16.021 --> 01:08:18.170
<v Speaker 4>that has no bearing on my individual </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>

1586
01:08:18.230 --> 01:08:23.230
<v Speaker 4>Like we've cleared double standards,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like when will just believe you and one </v>

1587
01:08:24.561 --> 01:08:27.020
<v Speaker 4>will be super skeptical.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Barry Barry crimmins like because he,</v>

1588
01:08:27.021 --> 01:08:27.370
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

1589
01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:29.420

<v Speaker 4>anybody listening,</v>

1595
01:08:44.860 --> 01:08:46.721
<v Speaker 4>to somebody and he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he told us talking about it </v>

1596
01:08:46.721 --> 01:08:48.671
<v Speaker 4>onstage first or something and he ended </v>
<v Speaker 4>up winning when the Internet was first </v>

1597
01:08:48.671 --> 01:08:51.220
<v Speaker 4>becoming a nationwide thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was,</v>

1598
01:08:51.420 --> 01:08:55.550
<v Speaker 4>there was child pornography everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like pedophiles were by aol by the hour.</v>

1599
01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:58.490
<v Speaker 4>If you are rich and you could just </v>
<v Speaker 4>freely trade child pornography.</v>

1600
01:08:58.820 --> 01:09:03.820
<v Speaker 4>So he had to testify before Congress,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Senate and AOL had a lawyer there </v>

1601
01:09:03.820 --> 01:09:04.640
<v Speaker 4>because they didn't want to change their</v>
<v Speaker 4>policy,</v>

1602
01:09:04.641 --> 01:09:08.450
<v Speaker 4>which was three strikes and you're out </v>
<v Speaker 4>for child pornography.</v>

1603
01:09:08.750 --> 01:09:10.460
<v Speaker 4>That's in the beginning.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Isn't that crazy that that was only like</v>
<v Speaker 4>1995 or 96 or something like that.</v>

1606
01:09:16.970 --> 01:09:19.780
<v Speaker 4>It's just one of the best parts of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>documentary because Barry's like,</v>

1614
01:09:33.011 --> 01:09:34.871
<v Speaker 4>tripping over themselves in a manly </v>
<v Speaker 4>display of being ignorant of technology </v>

01:13:31.201 --> 01:13:35.660
<v Speaker 4>It's a bad relationship except you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>not dating it so hostile because this is</v>

1709
01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:40.760
<v Speaker 4>because there are going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't even know they're so into this </v>

1710
01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:41.440
<v Speaker 4>identity shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what it is?</v>

1711
01:13:41.441 --> 01:13:43.490
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think part of it is um,</v>

1712
01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:48.620
<v Speaker 4>social media of course.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think all of these attacks and shit or</v>

1713
01:13:51.090 --> 01:13:53.130
<v Speaker 4>antisocial,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're like weird.</v>

1714
01:13:54.500 --> 01:13:56.280
<v Speaker 4>The way people would talk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1715
01:13:56.281 --> 01:13:57.980
<v Speaker 4>it's tricking these girls to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking.</v>

1716
01:13:57.990 --> 01:13:59.850
<v Speaker 4>They're going to have their little angry</v>
<v Speaker 4>black guy moment.</v>

1717
01:13:59.851 --> 01:14:02.610
<v Speaker 4>But here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not like black people.</v>

1718
01:14:02.611 --> 01:14:05.160
<v Speaker 4>You're not like a suppressed </v>
<v Speaker 4>marginalized minority,</v>

1719
01:14:05.430 --> 01:14:10.430
<v Speaker 4>feminine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know where they're getting that </v>

1720
01:14:10.430 --> 01:14:11.961
<v Speaker 4>from.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You are absolutely not an identity of </v>

1721
01:14:11.961 --> 01:14:14.691
<v Speaker 4>women together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And here's how I know they proved that </v>

1722
01:14:14.691 --> 01:14:14.691
<v Speaker 4>at the women's March when they kicked </v>
<v Speaker 4>the prolife women out.</v>

1723
01:14:14.691 --> 01:14:16.990
<v Speaker 4>See Black people have to take all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all their garbage.</v>

1724
01:14:16.991 --> 01:14:19.990
<v Speaker 4>Black people they have to take in their </v>
<v Speaker 4>movement because it's still don't doe,</v>

1725
01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:22.170
<v Speaker 4>but black people have to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're forced to,</v>

1726
01:14:22.190 --> 01:14:23.740
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to bargain like a minority.</v>

1727
01:14:23.741 --> 01:14:27.850
<v Speaker 4>I get that women are half the population</v>
<v Speaker 4>got fucking women's March.</v>

1728
01:14:27.970 --> 01:14:31.510
<v Speaker 4>They kick out the prolife women.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a luxury you have when you're not</v>

1729
01:14:31.511 --> 01:14:33.690
<v Speaker 4>in the press minority.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's when you have it pretty good.</v>

1730
01:14:35.580 --> 01:14:37.360
<v Speaker 4>We don't know what like what is minority</v>
<v Speaker 4>mean?</v>

1731
01:14:37.361 --> 01:14:42.361
<v Speaker 4>Like being one in 10,000.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the Asians.</v>

1732
01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:45.610
<v Speaker 4>That story though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy that they know that.</v>

1733
01:14:45.670 --> 01:14:50.670
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did not see if you can find that </v>

1734
01:14:50.670 --> 01:14:50.670
<v Speaker 4>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1735
01:14:50.670 --> 01:14:50.670
<v Speaker 4>They want to see some footage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1736
01:14:50.670 --> 01:14:52.540
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't be surprised if there were </v>
<v Speaker 4>like kicking a woman.</v>

1737
01:14:52.810 --> 01:14:54.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you're not an oppressed minority.</v>

1738
01:14:54.911 --> 01:14:58.420
<v Speaker 4>If you can afford to kick out the </v>
<v Speaker 4>prolife women this March.</v>

1739
01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:03.480
<v Speaker 4>It's a crazy time too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean objectively with no political </v>

1740
01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:05.830
<v Speaker 4>leanings left or right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy when they're kicking out.</v>

1741
01:15:05.831 --> 01:15:07.840
<v Speaker 4>The people that are saying don't kill </v>
<v Speaker 4>the babies.</v>

1742
01:15:07.990 --> 01:15:11.710
<v Speaker 4>I now look at what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1743
01:15:11.711 --> 01:15:13.680
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying you shouldn't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what is it about.</v>

1744
01:15:13.690 --> 01:15:14.810
<v Speaker 4>You were a boarding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1745
01:15:14.811 --> 01:15:19.811
<v Speaker 4>you know what will eventually be at </v>
<v Speaker 4>these are people that fundamentally </v>

1746
01:15:19.811 --> 01:15:22.741
<v Speaker 4>refused to acknowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like watching people that you get </v>

1747
01:15:22.741 --> 01:15:22.741
<v Speaker 4>divorced.</v>

1748
01:15:22.741 --> 01:15:24.670
<v Speaker 4>Argue the argument.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've tried to argue this patient because</v>

1749
01:15:24.671 --> 01:15:26.020
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my mother doesn't hate women.</v>

1750
01:15:26.021 --> 01:15:27.880
<v Speaker 4>She's a Christian lady that thinks it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>murder.</v>

1751
01:15:28.300 --> 01:15:29.140
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

1752
01:15:29.141 --> 01:15:31.330
<v Speaker 4>maybe you're killing a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't give a fuck I.</v>

1753
01:15:31.331 --> 01:15:32.860
<v Speaker 4>it's not my baby.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go do what you want.</v>

1754
01:15:33.380 --> 01:15:36.310
<v Speaker 4>The anti,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the pro choice or intense.</v>

1755
01:15:36.430 --> 01:15:38.890
<v Speaker 4>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't give a fuck.</v>

1756
01:15:38.891 --> 01:15:40.690
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>

1757
01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:42.010
<v Speaker 4>if you're the kind of person that can do</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

1758
01:15:42.030 --> 01:15:43.540
<v Speaker 4>they maybe you should do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1759
01:15:43.900 --> 01:15:44.430
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1760
01:15:44.431 --> 01:15:45.760
<v Speaker 4>I don't give a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>

1761
01:15:45.790 --> 01:15:47.770
<v Speaker 4>it's not a fucking uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1762
01:15:48.580 --> 01:15:51.890
<v Speaker 4>that's you and your God does to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1763
01:15:52.060 --> 01:15:53.560
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

1764
01:15:54.230 --> 01:15:59.230
<v Speaker 4>conversely also if you have your kid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I also don't give a fuck about your kid </v>

1765
01:15:59.230 --> 01:15:59.230
<v Speaker 4>and if I don't have kids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just don't,</v>

1766
01:15:59.230 --> 01:16:00.370
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that it to you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm just saying,</v>

1767
01:16:00.371 --> 01:16:03.250
<v Speaker 4>I'm not like [inaudible] you're a </v>
<v Speaker 4>different amount of caffeine.</v>

1768
01:16:03.250 --> 01:16:08.250
<v Speaker 4>Bra is so jacked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why is the women's March excluding pro </v>

1769
01:16:08.250 --> 01:16:08.710
<v Speaker 4>life women?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well this is the week now.</v>

1770
01:16:08.711 --> 01:16:09.340
<v Speaker 4>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are they get.</v>

1771
01:16:09.490 --> 01:16:14.490
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should find someone that's saying a </v>

1772
01:16:14.490 --> 01:16:16.060
<v Speaker 4>should do on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But once I listen to the bottom line is </v>

1773
01:16:16.060 --> 01:16:17.230
<v Speaker 4>they go and I have talked a million </v>
<v Speaker 4>times to people that talk about they go.</v>

1774
01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:22.000
<v Speaker 4>It's either somewhat always emotional,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the person you're talking to and it's a,</v>

1775
01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:25.610
<v Speaker 4>they want to control my body as a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's why they're anti abortion.</v>

1776
01:16:25.611 --> 01:16:26.050
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1777
01:16:26.051 --> 01:16:27.400
<v Speaker 4>they think it's baby murder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1778
01:16:27.401 --> 01:16:29.410
<v Speaker 4>they want to control my.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you talked to the other people like</v>

1779
01:16:29.411 --> 01:16:33.610
<v Speaker 4>they want to have an immoral lifestyle </v>
<v Speaker 4>and Blah like really gets broken down.</v>

1780
01:16:33.611 --> 01:16:35.770
<v Speaker 4>Is that one sentence a woman's right to </v>
<v Speaker 4>choose.</v>

1781
01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:39.070
<v Speaker 4>Like you don't even say to choose what I</v>
<v Speaker 4>keep going.</v>

1782
01:16:39.390 --> 01:16:42.040
<v Speaker 4>Like they cut it off because it sounds </v>
<v Speaker 4>uncomfortable.</v>

1783
01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:46.900
<v Speaker 4>It's a woman's a woman's right to choose</v>
<v Speaker 4>to abort a baby.</v>

1784
01:16:47.070 --> 01:16:48.220
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think it is.</v>

1785
01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:50.440
<v Speaker 4>That's not my right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's pregnant.</v>

1786
01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:53.150
<v Speaker 4>I would decide if I'm fucking avenue I </v>
<v Speaker 4>couldn't care about.</v>

1787
01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:54.160
<v Speaker 4>I'm like Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to decide.</v>

1788
01:16:55.210 --> 01:16:57.740
<v Speaker 4>I could only put myself in so much </v>
<v Speaker 4>choose if that's what I'd watched.</v>

1789
01:16:57.750 --> 01:16:59.830
<v Speaker 4>So that's why I'm for so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But.</v>

1790
01:16:59.831 --> 01:17:02.590
<v Speaker 4>But rovy Wade is a very excellent </v>
<v Speaker 4>compromised,</v>

1791
01:17:02.591 --> 01:17:05.160
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's late term abortion.</v>

1792
01:17:05.190 --> 01:17:10.190
<v Speaker 4>See the late term abortion is fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>gross and I understand if it's a </v>

1793
01:17:10.190 --> 01:17:10.790
<v Speaker 4>miserable fucking defect,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fine.</v>

1794
01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:16.480
<v Speaker 4>But if you look at the numbers and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>very hard to get accurate abortion </v>

1795
01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:19.811
<v Speaker 4>numbers because it's so politicized.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The late term abortions are not as I </v>

1796
01:17:19.811 --> 01:17:20.360
<v Speaker 4>would have thought because of </v>
<v Speaker 4>deformities.</v>

1797
01:17:20.390 --> 01:17:25.390
<v Speaker 4>It's a lot of times they either didn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>know they were pregnant or just hit </v>

1798
01:17:25.390 --> 01:17:25.920
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's Kinda shitty bro.</v>

1799
01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:29.930
<v Speaker 4>You can see the wrong man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But like I said,</v>

1800
01:17:29.931 --> 01:17:31.790
<v Speaker 4>if you as a mother could do that that </v>
<v Speaker 4>late,</v>

1801
01:17:31.870 --> 01:17:33.380
<v Speaker 4>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe you shouldn't raise a kid,</v>

1802
01:17:33.410 --> 01:17:34.680
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1803
01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:36.500
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but early on,</v>

1804
01:17:36.501 --> 01:17:37.760
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you're murdering anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1805
01:17:37.761 --> 01:17:39.050
<v Speaker 4>or if you do it early,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

1806
01:17:39.060 --> 01:17:39.550
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1807
01:17:39.700 --> 01:17:42.070
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is a slippery conversation though.</v>

1808
01:17:42.100 --> 01:17:47.100
<v Speaker 2>And this is what people who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideologically attached to that left wing</v>

1809
01:17:47.741 --> 01:17:52.741
<v Speaker 2>dogma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not willing to have this </v>

1810
01:17:52.741 --> 01:17:52.750
<v Speaker 2>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you have these pro life women,</v>

1811
01:17:52.900 --> 01:17:56.140
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to have a dialogue like </v>
<v Speaker 2>their mind is completely,</v>

1812
01:17:56.470 --> 01:17:57.450
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they better listen.</v>

1813
01:17:57.480 --> 01:18:02.480
<v Speaker 4>Here's my other thing is just be </v>
<v Speaker 4>consistent if you're pro life because </v>

1814
01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:02.480
<v Speaker 4>the Catholic church is at least </v>
<v Speaker 4>consistent prolife,</v>

1815
01:18:02.490 --> 01:18:04.240
<v Speaker 4>they're anti death penalty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1816
01:18:04.241 --> 01:18:06.690
<v Speaker 4>They're pro life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were against the Iraq war,</v>

1817
01:18:06.691 --> 01:18:07.500
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1818
01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:09.630
<v Speaker 4>go down the last birth control.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1819
01:18:09.631 --> 01:18:11.140
<v Speaker 4>because you're supposed to bring more </v>
<v Speaker 4>light.</v>

1820
01:18:11.290 --> 01:18:14.010
<v Speaker 4>So at least you're teaching is </v>
<v Speaker 4>consistent.</v>

1821
01:18:14.070 --> 01:18:15.630
<v Speaker 4>I can't see in these people that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1822
01:18:15.631 --> 01:18:17.400
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you want to have your right wing,</v>

1823
01:18:17.401 --> 01:18:22.401
<v Speaker 4>no social welfare state,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to have to fucking allow </v>

1824
01:18:22.401 --> 01:18:23.070
<v Speaker 4>abortion because you're gonna have to </v>
<v Speaker 4>take help.</v>

1825
01:18:23.071 --> 01:18:25.320
<v Speaker 4>Take care of these fucking kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you willing to do that?</v>

1826
01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:27.210
<v Speaker 4>Some of them are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but a lot of them are not,</v>

1827
01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:28.790
<v Speaker 4>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we went and blew up Iraq,</v>

1828
01:18:28.870 --> 01:18:30.300
<v Speaker 4>Ms Dot Christians that wanted to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

1829
01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:32.370
<v Speaker 4>there's Kelvion Christians.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're okay.</v>

1830
01:18:32.371 --> 01:18:37.371
<v Speaker 4>They're like the original fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>Christians there have babies at their </v>

1831
01:18:37.371 --> 01:18:38.280
<v Speaker 4>collateral damage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You call them and that's,</v>

1832
01:18:38.310 --> 01:18:39.570
<v Speaker 4>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It happens,</v>

1833
01:18:40.010 --> 01:18:45.010
<v Speaker 4>but okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's the difference between that and </v>

1834
01:18:45.010 --> 01:18:47.841
<v Speaker 4>some woman in New York?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The collateral damage of on the way to </v>

1835
01:18:47.841 --> 01:18:47.841
<v Speaker 4>her career,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she doesn't have the baby.</v>

1836
01:18:47.841 --> 01:18:51.590
<v Speaker 4>If you accept that OSCE dropping bombs </v>
<v Speaker 4>on somebodies fucking pregnant wife and </v>

1837
01:18:51.590 --> 01:18:53.400
<v Speaker 4>killing their unborn baby because it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>convenient for us.</v>

1838
01:18:53.550 --> 01:18:58.550
<v Speaker 4>Thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shut the fuck up about someone getting </v>

1839
01:18:58.550 --> 01:18:58.550
<v Speaker 4>an abortion because you're a hypocrite.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Control life down the line.</v>

1840
01:18:58.550 --> 01:18:58.550
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

1841
01:18:58.550 --> 01:19:00.600
<v Speaker 2>that's a very good rant and true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Well I can't go on facebook anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll get in trouble.</v>

1843
01:19:02.550 --> 01:19:04.180
<v Speaker 2>That's a very good rant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1844
01:19:04.510 --> 01:19:07.450
<v Speaker 2>what you're saying is right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the people are very convenient,</v>

1845
01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:10.600
<v Speaker 2>it's very inconsistent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're absolutely right.</v>

1846
01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:15.640
<v Speaker 2>Bitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm bitter for my religion because I'm </v>

1847
01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:15.640
<v Speaker 2>the sucker that would believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1848
01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:16.080
<v Speaker 2>It would dawn on me later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1849
01:19:16.090 --> 01:19:17.770
<v Speaker 2>We don't actually do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're just,</v>

1850
01:19:17.830 --> 01:19:18.880
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1851
01:19:18.881 --> 01:19:20.560
<v Speaker 2>you can't fudge chip on your shoulder </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of that.</v>

1852
01:19:20.710 --> 01:19:24.190
<v Speaker 2>And you and I have had this conversation</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of times because you'll say,</v>

1853
01:19:24.191 --> 01:19:26.260
<v Speaker 2>I know what these people are trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do with their words.</v>

1854
01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:30.250
<v Speaker 2>I remember this shit from when I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>told the same thing.</v>

1855
01:19:30.310 --> 01:19:31.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm a suppressive person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1856
01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:33.290
<v Speaker 4>Or an apostate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joe Is witnesses.</v>

1857
01:19:34.030 --> 01:19:37.550
<v Speaker 4>I'm always in a positive thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It should be an ally castle title.</v>

1858
01:19:37.910 --> 01:19:38.710
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because dude,</v>

1859

<v Speaker 4>I get a good title.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ooh,</v>

1860
01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:42.230
<v Speaker 4>I like it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

1861
01:19:43.140 --> 01:19:45.520
<v Speaker 4>12 apostates.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get fucking,</v>

1862
01:19:45.570 --> 01:19:46.850
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1863
01:19:47.080 --> 01:19:48.560
<v Speaker 4>really upset by that group.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1864
01:19:48.580 --> 01:19:50.740
<v Speaker 4>don't stumble your brother once,</v>
<v Speaker 4>once.</v>

1865
01:19:50.741 --> 01:19:52.990
<v Speaker 4>The truth is just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>telling the truth.</v>

1866
01:19:52.991 --> 01:19:55.450
<v Speaker 4>It's not in the interest of the group to</v>
<v Speaker 4>tell the truth.</v>

1867
01:19:55.451 --> 01:19:58.290
<v Speaker 4>That's really upsetting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just really gets under my.</v>

1868
01:19:58.730 --> 01:19:59.300
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it should.</v>

1869
01:19:59.301 --> 01:20:04.301
<v Speaker 2>It's like what we're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it brings back the same thing as Jordan </v>

1870
01:20:04.301 --> 01:20:07.540
<v Speaker 2>Peterson thing when they're calling him </v>
<v Speaker 2>a Nazi and they're calling him a </v>

1871
01:20:07.540 --> 01:20:07.540
<v Speaker 2>transphobic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand.</v>

1872
01:20:07.540 --> 01:20:08.100
<v Speaker 2>He's a professor at the University of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Toronto.</v>

1873
01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:13.100
<v Speaker 3>It's become very famous for battling </v>
<v Speaker 3>against Social Justice Warrior Ideology </v>

1874
01:20:13.530 --> 01:20:18.530
<v Speaker 3>Online,</v>
<v Speaker 3>specifically them imposing in one of </v>

1875
01:20:18.530 --> 01:20:21.981
<v Speaker 3>their bills and Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The you have to use someone specified </v>

1876
01:20:21.981 --> 01:20:25.170
<v Speaker 3>gender pronouns and there if you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you don't do it,</v>

1877
01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:28.410
<v Speaker 3>it could be thought of as like a human </v>
<v Speaker 3>rights violation.</v>

1878
01:20:28.470 --> 01:20:30.280
<v Speaker 3>Will they have those human rights </v>
<v Speaker 3>courts,</v>

1879
01:20:30.350 --> 01:20:33.190
<v Speaker 3>the human rights councils up there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's subtle counselor.</v>

1880
01:20:33.270 --> 01:20:35.970
<v Speaker 3>It's a very different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't have freedom of speech.</v>

1881
01:20:35.971 --> 01:20:39.150
<v Speaker 3>It's not the same as free speech is kind</v>
<v Speaker 3>of an American thing,</v>

1882
01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:42.500
<v Speaker 3>but what it talked about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What would it be?</v>

1883
01:20:42.550 --> 01:20:47.550
<v Speaker 3>Pronouns like Faggot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you have to say that because </v>

1884
01:20:47.550 --> 01:20:49.470
<v Speaker 3>that would also be hate speech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like this weird.</v>

1885
01:20:49.471 --> 01:20:54.471
<v Speaker 3>Circle me my word,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it can't be a pronoun you parents or </v>

1886
01:20:54.471 --> 01:20:59.300
<v Speaker 3>identity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some control over what the </v>

1887
01:20:59.300 --> 01:21:01.791
<v Speaker 3>pronouns will be like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could probably say you're a storm </v>

1888
01:21:01.791 --> 01:21:01.791
<v Speaker 3>trooper,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1889
01:21:01.791 --> 01:21:06.260
<v Speaker 3>You could probably get crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you probably can't say you're a </v>

1890
01:21:06.260 --> 01:21:06.260
<v Speaker 3>Faggot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what if that's your identity,</v>

1891
01:21:06.260 --> 01:21:11.211
<v Speaker 3>like who's to say what your identity is?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your identity cannot be an offensive </v>

1892
01:21:11.211 --> 01:21:12.030
<v Speaker 3>word it because your identity is lashing</v>
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>

1893
01:21:12.031 --> 01:21:16.140
<v Speaker 3>hurting other people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What if you identify as white CIS male?</v>

1894
01:21:16.380 --> 01:21:18.400
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a white cisgender gay.</v>

1895
01:21:18.420 --> 01:21:23.420
<v Speaker 3>I got no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll call you whatever the fuck you </v>

1896
01:21:23.420 --> 01:21:23.420
<v Speaker 3>want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got no issue with that.</v>

1897
01:21:23.420 --> 01:21:23.760
<v Speaker 3>No issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Forced,</v>

1898
01:21:24.850 --> 01:21:29.100
<v Speaker 3>forced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was saying he was battling against it</v>

1899
01:21:29.101 --> 01:21:34.101
<v Speaker 3>very early on and almost everything he </v>
<v Speaker 3>said would happen is happening now in </v>

1900
01:21:34.101 --> 01:21:36.000
<v Speaker 3>terms of this overreaction culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Welcome.</v>

1901
01:21:36.090 --> 01:21:38.050
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how come that's.</v>

1902
01:21:38.220 --> 01:21:43.220
<v Speaker 3>Remember Jamie Kilstein had had a </v>
<v Speaker 3>capacity of about it that a white boy </v>

1903
01:21:43.220 --> 01:21:44.420
<v Speaker 3>blues song he did and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1904
01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:46.780
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what this means,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I go,</v>

1905
01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:52.160
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you got to put everything on the </v>

1906
01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:52.160
<v Speaker 3>white males.</v>

1907
01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:53.990
<v Speaker 3>Now that's like the religion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but do you want us to believe anyone </v>

1908
01:21:53.990 --> 01:21:54.480
<v Speaker 3>outside of a young white male knows what</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fuck's?</v>

1909
01:21:54.481 --> 01:21:56.970
<v Speaker 3>This means like where I used to live in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Washington heights in New York.</v>

1910
01:21:56.971 --> 01:21:59.160
<v Speaker 3>I want you to go out and talk to any of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Dominicans on the corner and go,</v>

1911
01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:00.900
<v Speaker 3>do you know you're a CIS male?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1912
01:22:00.901 --> 01:22:02.460
<v Speaker 3>And ask her if they know what the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 3>that means.</v>

1913
01:22:02.461 --> 01:22:07.461
<v Speaker 3>They'll stop you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to be a white super recent </v>

1914
01:22:07.461 --> 01:22:07.890
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Plus gender is supposed to adopt it.</v>

1915
01:22:07.891 --> 01:22:08.430
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1916
01:22:08.431 --> 01:22:11.220
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you what you want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but why you get to pick my title.</v>

1917
01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:13.410
<v Speaker 3>It's also nonsense words.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a Marxist.</v>

1918
01:22:13.890 --> 01:22:18.890
<v Speaker 3>Marxism does it alliance and if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>agree to nonsense,</v>

1919
01:22:19.411 --> 01:22:23.850
<v Speaker 3>that's one step closer to dominance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where everyone knows.</v>

1920
01:22:23.910 --> 01:22:25.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is really like a religion.</v>

1921
01:22:25.771 --> 01:22:29.160
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a consensus based religion which is</v>

1922
01:22:29.161 --> 01:22:30.930
<v Speaker 3>really being Vegan is kosher.</v>

1923
01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:36.570
<v Speaker 3>Is it that people fall into that so easy</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they come to comfortable by.</v>

1924
01:22:36.571 --> 01:22:41.571
<v Speaker 3>Barry told me that I didn't understand </v>
<v Speaker 3>the level because people fucking hate </v>

1925
01:22:41.571 --> 01:22:43.140
<v Speaker 3>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why they're online creating these</v>

1926
01:22:43.141 --> 01:22:46.830
<v Speaker 3>new identities and shit and if you don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>hate yourself,</v>

1927
01:22:47.250 --> 01:22:48.530
<v Speaker 3>because I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>before I had that,</v>

1928

01:23:39.700 --> 01:23:41.440
<v Speaker 3>there's that whole joke thief shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1956
01:23:49.810 --> 01:23:54.810
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that's arrogant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I just been doing it for 20 years </v>

1957
01:23:54.810 --> 01:23:54.810
<v Speaker 3>and you never had the balls to get on </v>
<v Speaker 3>stage.</v>

1958
01:23:54.810 --> 01:23:54.810
<v Speaker 3>So I think I just know better.</v>

1959
01:23:54.810 --> 01:23:59.460
<v Speaker 3>They're outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're fighting with someone who's not </v>

1960
01:23:59.460 --> 01:24:01.210
<v Speaker 3>even here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started some jokes.</v>

01:24:01.211 --> 01:24:03.220
<v Speaker 3>He fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one has any idea what the fuck you're</v>

1962
01:24:03.221 --> 01:24:05.110
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right guys is when I defended amy,</v>

1963
01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:08.500
<v Speaker 3>amy and I had people like lecture and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1964
01:24:08.501 --> 01:24:10.870
<v Speaker 3>don't listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't presume to tell me Shit.</v>

1965
01:24:11.460 --> 01:24:12.640
<v Speaker 3>But.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they're outraged.</v>

1966
01:24:12.860 --> 01:24:17.860
<v Speaker 3>But at the same as the social jihadis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they all think the same reason I became </v>

1967
01:24:17.860 --> 01:24:17.860
<v Speaker 3>a comic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could do that,</v>

1968
01:24:18.550 --> 01:24:20.110
<v Speaker 3>but at least I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1969
01:24:20.140 --> 01:24:21.700
<v Speaker 3>if you get on stage and do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll give it to you.</v>

1970
01:24:21.701 --> 01:24:23.320
<v Speaker 3>But these people think they can do your </v>
<v Speaker 3>job,</v>

1971
01:24:23.470 --> 01:24:25.180
<v Speaker 3>but hold on a second.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In their defense,</v>

1972
01:24:25.510 --> 01:24:30.510
<v Speaker 3>they're looking at a film that shows </v>
<v Speaker 3>time after time that daddy made </v>

1973
01:24:30.580 --> 01:24:33.700
<v Speaker 3>specifically fuck her because she said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I play a racist Republican.</v>

1974
01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:39.070
<v Speaker 3>The little youtube video where they took</v>
<v Speaker 3>movies fuck in the show.</v>

1975
01:24:39.220 --> 01:24:40.690
<v Speaker 3>Which by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she doesn't write the show.</v>

1976
01:24:40.930 --> 01:24:45.930
<v Speaker 3>It was ridiculous and it was exactly </v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fucking sjws did to me where </v>

1977
01:24:45.930 --> 01:24:47.500
<v Speaker 3>they don't like you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They think you have an agenda.</v>

1978
01:24:47.501 --> 01:24:50.320
<v Speaker 3>They got to destroy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they create this fucking,</v>

1979
01:24:50.380 --> 01:24:51.510
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1980
01:24:51.530 --> 01:24:52.360
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1981
01:24:52.361 --> 01:24:53.200
<v Speaker 3>it's like a smear job.</v>

1982
01:24:55.530 --> 01:24:58.240
<v Speaker 3>There were bits that were exactly the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same,</v>

1983
01:24:58.550 --> 01:25:01.540
<v Speaker 3>very mediocre bits that thought off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

1984
01:25:01.541 --> 01:25:03.220
<v Speaker 3>relax,</v>
<v Speaker 3>relax.</v>

1985
01:25:03.221 --> 01:25:05.980
<v Speaker 3>I drank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I Cave Man Nitros,</v>

1986
01:25:05.981 --> 01:25:07.350
<v Speaker 3>and you're talking to me this way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>

1987
01:25:07.351 --> 01:25:12.351
<v Speaker 3>I know this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're going to run through the </v>

1988
01:25:12.351 --> 01:25:15.781
<v Speaker 3>wall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's a crick shaped and </v>

1989
01:25:15.781 --> 01:25:17.171
<v Speaker 3>print content.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So get a caveman nitrile you're,</v>

1990
01:25:17.250 --> 01:25:19.000
<v Speaker 3>but you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're arguing against someone who's not</v>

1991
01:25:19.001 --> 01:25:21.900
<v Speaker 3>even here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why they are going at me.</v>

1992
01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:25.390
<v Speaker 3>That's what the problem with what you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying is they have evidence.</v>

1993
01:25:25.750 --> 01:25:28.600
<v Speaker 3>They're looking at one bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good point.</v>

1994
01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.810
<v Speaker 3>Where if I look at the evidence and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>come to a different conclusion,</v>

1995
01:25:32.110 --> 01:25:34.060
<v Speaker 3>let's go with my conclusion because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was there.</v>

1996
01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:38.710
<v Speaker 3>A process guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not enough.</v>

1997
01:25:38.711 --> 01:25:40.750
<v Speaker 3>That's not enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not enough to convince someone,</v>

1998
01:25:40.830 --> 01:25:41.700
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just trust me.</v>

1999
01:25:41.740 --> 01:25:46.060
<v Speaker 3>You think of authoritative sheriff type </v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>

2000
01:25:46.061 --> 01:25:46.810
<v Speaker 3>Just trust me.</v>

2001
01:25:49.580 --> 01:25:53.080
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're coming to me,</v>

2002
01:25:54.730 --> 01:25:57.100
<v Speaker 3>trust me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm watching this video,</v>

2003
01:25:57.250 --> 01:25:59.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm watching these jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're being repeated.</v>

2004
01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:01.550
<v Speaker 3>You're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just trust me.</v>

2005
01:26:01.551 --> 01:26:02.310
<v Speaker 3>Chokes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You taught.</v>

2006
01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:04.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about sketches piece get </v>
<v Speaker 3>claimed were taken,</v>

2007
01:26:04.581 --> 01:26:06.320
<v Speaker 3>which is nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in the room.</v>

2008
01:26:06.500 --> 01:26:08.760
<v Speaker 3>I left the fucking cop of the room with </v>
<v Speaker 3>that shit.</v>

2009
01:26:08.780 --> 01:26:11.470
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't mean that you know and </v>
<v Speaker 3>watch mad TV and stop.</v>

2010
01:26:11.550 --> 01:26:14.600
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't mean anything because the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bits still got on the air.</v>

2011
01:26:14.780 --> 01:26:17.100
<v Speaker 3>So you what I'm saying like you might </v>
<v Speaker 3>not have been happening.</v>

2012
01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:19.220
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what you have to say.</v>

2013
01:26:19.310 --> 01:26:20.540
<v Speaker 3>That's not what you say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say that.</v>

2014
01:26:20.580 --> 01:26:20.770
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2015
01:26:20.771 --> 01:26:20.970
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2016
01:26:20.971 --> 01:26:21.230
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2017
01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:24.500
<v Speaker 3>But that's not a job you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can't say that.</v>

2018
01:26:24.501 --> 01:26:29.210
<v Speaker 3>These people don't have actual examples </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the same bits over and over again.</v>

2019
01:26:29.211 --> 01:26:31.670
<v Speaker 3>If they're parallel thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's fine,</v>

2020
01:26:31.940 --> 01:26:33.530
<v Speaker 3>but it has to be related.</v>

2021
01:26:33.860 --> 01:26:37.130
<v Speaker 3>But you didn't really see this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this whole thing about this.</v>

2022
01:26:38.380 --> 01:26:40.730
<v Speaker 3>I'm very confused,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very confused.</v>

2023
01:26:40.790 --> 01:26:43.210
<v Speaker 3>The whole thing from the top down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

2024
01:26:43.230 --> 01:26:44.340

<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>

2025
01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:46.790
<v Speaker 3>if they see the evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

<v Speaker 3>You have to like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>comedy.</v>

01:28:46.130 --> 01:28:51.130
<v Speaker 3>When I see like if I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I was never a standup and I saw this </v>

01:28:53.330 --> 01:28:57.310
<v Speaker 3>I would want Kurt Metzger to explain to </v>
<v Speaker 3>me what happened.</v>

2078
01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:16.520

<v Speaker 4>to brush it off and say that you know </v>

2079
01:29:17.011 --> 01:29:20.430
<v Speaker 4>better than to tell you why?</v>

2085
01:29:38.030 --> 01:29:39.381
<v Speaker 4>people think I'm a psycho is because </v>

<v Speaker 1>people are reacting to this movie.</v>

2160
01:32:45.680 --> 01:32:47.560
<v Speaker 1>I love it because they're black and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>black dude.</v>

2161
01:32:47.560 --> 01:32:51.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm at the worst level of being known </v>
<v Speaker 1>where like I have reached,</v>

2162
01:32:51.401 --> 01:32:53.890
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not famous enough for people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he's a comedian.</v>

2163
01:32:53.940 --> 01:32:55.620
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You brought that up when I got fucked.</v>

2164
01:32:55.630 --> 01:32:58.540
<v Speaker 1>It's like not famous enough to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

2165
01:32:59.140 --> 01:33:04.140
<v Speaker 1>Famous enough to get fucked over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm big enough where someone wants </v>

2166
01:33:04.140 --> 01:33:04.140
<v Speaker 1>to hunt me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>

2167
01:33:04.140 --> 01:33:04.810
<v Speaker 1>no one's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2168
01:33:04.820 --> 01:33:05.830
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one bedroom in the comedian.</v>

2169
01:33:05.831 --> 01:33:07.160
<v Speaker 1>Some of them are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2170
01:33:07.161 --> 01:33:09.250
<v Speaker 1>we must work for a college hr </v>
<v Speaker 1>departments.</v>

2171
01:33:09.430 --> 01:33:11.020
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you see the Black Panther?</v>

2172
01:33:11.270 --> 01:33:12.850
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2173
01:33:13.110 --> 01:33:15.310
<v Speaker 1>it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty fucking good though.</v>

2174
01:33:15.790 --> 01:33:17.620
<v Speaker 1>Annihilation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to see that.</v>

2175
01:33:17.621 --> 01:33:18.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

2176
01:33:18.190 --> 01:33:19.900
<v Speaker 1>that's a trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't spoil it,</v>

2177
01:33:19.901 --> 01:33:20.440
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't.</v>

2178
01:33:20.441 --> 01:33:24.740
<v Speaker 1>But from that [inaudible] guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy made a watch that if,</v>

2179
01:33:24.940 --> 01:33:27.070
<v Speaker 1>if this was such a racially uplifting </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie,</v>

2180
01:33:27.820 --> 01:33:28.360
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his name,</v>

2181
01:33:28.690 --> 01:33:31.160
<v Speaker 1>his first name wouldn't be black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Black Panther.</v>

2182
01:33:31.161 --> 01:33:32.950
<v Speaker 1>That wouldn't be in the Black Panther </v>
<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>

2183
01:33:32.951 --> 01:33:37.951
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a fucking exploitation saying </v>

2184
01:33:37.951 --> 01:33:39.780
<v Speaker 1>shaft is like Selma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when do you think they came up with</v>

2185
01:33:39.781 --> 01:33:41.340
<v Speaker 1>a Black Panther?</v>
<v Speaker 1>16.</v>

2186
01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:44.860
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>panthers are black already.</v>

2187
01:33:44.861 --> 01:33:47.140
<v Speaker 1>You don't need to specify that unless </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're letting me know.</v>

2188
01:33:47.141 --> 01:33:48.760
<v Speaker 1>The guy under the suit is black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2189
01:33:48.761 --> 01:33:50.740
<v Speaker 1>you know what it actually is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a Jaguar.</v>

2190
01:33:50.950 --> 01:33:55.950
<v Speaker 1>It's the Jaguar that has spots </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere instead of just some spots </v>

2191
01:33:55.950 --> 01:33:58.870
<v Speaker 1>because Jaguars some Jack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not really totally black,</v>

2192
01:33:58.871 --> 01:34:00.670
<v Speaker 1>like a black panthers kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

2193
01:34:00.800 --> 01:34:05.800
<v Speaker 1>It's not like scientific drama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't find a black jacket for they.</v>

2194
01:34:10.661 --> 01:34:15.661
<v Speaker 1>If you see the black ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could still see like some faint </v>

2195
01:34:15.661 --> 01:34:17.710
<v Speaker 1>outlines of like those Jaguar little </v>
<v Speaker 1>dots and circles.</v>

2196
01:34:17.770 --> 01:34:22.770
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like David attenborough does almost </v>

2197
01:34:22.770 --> 01:34:22.770
<v Speaker 1>make it seem like black panthers are </v>
<v Speaker 1>more hostile.</v>

2198
01:34:22.770 --> 01:34:24.570
<v Speaker 1>They were like the black panthers </v>
<v Speaker 1>stocking is pray.</v>

2199
01:34:24.580 --> 01:34:26.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the snow leopard is as elusive as he is.</v>

2200
01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:29.800
<v Speaker 1>Grateful they're all jaguars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there?</v>

2201
01:34:29.860 --> 01:34:34.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the black ones probably evolved </v>

2202
01:34:34.860 --> 01:34:37.981
<v Speaker 1>to be more successful hunting at night </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can't see a god damn thing </v>

2203
01:34:37.981 --> 01:34:40.300
<v Speaker 1>at night in the jungle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what black is,</v>

2204
01:34:40.420 --> 01:34:42.610
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine until the jungle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2205
01:34:42.611 --> 01:34:47.611
<v Speaker 1>but I've been to the Pacific northwest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm into those essentially rain forest </v>

2206
01:34:47.611 --> 01:34:52.441
<v Speaker 1>up there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's some parts of the Pacific </v>

2207
01:34:52.441 --> 01:34:52.441
<v Speaker 1>northwest that are insane at night too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2208
01:34:52.441 --> 01:34:55.100
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't believe how dark it gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you don't see shit.</v>

2209
01:34:56.280 --> 01:34:58.190
<v Speaker 1>It's dark in at noon.</v>

2210
01:34:58.430 --> 01:35:00.320
<v Speaker 3>When you go through the woods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's dark.</v>

2211
01:35:00.470 --> 01:35:03.170
<v Speaker 3>Like you won't get a Tan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could be fucking new.</v>

2212
01:35:03.171 --> 01:35:06.860
<v Speaker 3>Now it can be 85 degrees out and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>dark walking through those woods because</v>

2213
01:35:06.861 --> 01:35:10.220
<v Speaker 3>this canopy of leaves and super dense </v>
<v Speaker 3>tree growth,</v>

2214
01:35:11.190 --> 01:35:12.890
<v Speaker 3>like it's dark.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking night.</v>

2215
01:35:12.891 --> 01:35:15.650
<v Speaker 3>You must just hear these crazy noises.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah man.</v>

2216
01:35:15.710 --> 01:35:20.710
<v Speaker 3>Like elk sound intense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're intense and you just hear the </v>

2217
01:35:20.710 --> 01:35:25.091
<v Speaker 3>sound like a dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where's my point about it being dark </v>

2218
01:35:25.091 --> 01:35:25.091
<v Speaker 3>there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I told about the Black Panther,</v>

2219
01:35:25.091 --> 01:35:27.740
<v Speaker 3>Black Panther,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ones most likely in the jungle.</v>

2220
01:35:27.741 --> 01:35:31.100
<v Speaker 3>It's the same situation and the ones </v>
<v Speaker 3>that have the darkest or the less likely</v>

2221
01:35:31.101 --> 01:35:36.101
<v Speaker 3>to be seen and less likely or more </v>
<v Speaker 3>likely to be successful because there </v>

2222
01:35:36.101 --> 01:35:38.390
<v Speaker 3>attack ambush predators.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They sneak up on things and Jack,</v>

2223
01:35:38.391 --> 01:35:40.790
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what else do they do to deer and fucking</v>

2224
01:35:40.791 --> 01:35:45.791
<v Speaker 3>people to that spirit is what the king </v>
<v Speaker 3>of Wakanda has come into to become the </v>

2225
01:35:45.860 --> 01:35:45.860
<v Speaker 3>Black Panther.</v>

2226
01:35:45.860 --> 01:35:48.470
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was technology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's actually pretty cool.</v>

2227
01:35:48.471 --> 01:35:53.471
<v Speaker 3>The suit is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the coolest part of the movie </v>

2228
01:35:53.471 --> 01:35:53.570
<v Speaker 3>because it builds your forcing hit you </v>
<v Speaker 3>back like the dope.</v>

2229
01:35:53.630 --> 01:35:56.930
<v Speaker 3>But then his other part of his power is </v>
<v Speaker 3>they have this,</v>

2230
01:35:57.040 --> 01:35:59.830
<v Speaker 3>this giant they make from flowers and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>lays down and they,</v>

2231
01:35:59.900 --> 01:36:01.670
<v Speaker 3>I swear to God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they give him a purple drink.</v>

2232
01:36:02.330 --> 01:36:04.130
<v Speaker 3>He drinks a purple drink.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Jesus.</v>

2233
01:36:04.410 --> 01:36:05.810
<v Speaker 3>That's where he gets his other powers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2234
01:36:05.811 --> 01:36:10.811
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guys watching this ad from the comic </v>

2235

<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2236
01:36:10.950 --> 01:36:15.950

<v Speaker 3>are they even because they're making it </v>

<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2238

<v Speaker 3>Angelou was giving them the purple </v>

2239
01:36:19.611 --> 01:36:19.820
<v Speaker 3>drink,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jewish guys.</v>

2240
01:36:19.910 --> 01:36:23.530
<v Speaker 3>As long as no whites were involved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was an exploitation comic.</v>

2241
01:36:23.540 --> 01:36:28.540
<v Speaker 3>It's two Jewish guys from the seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that's when it came out to put it </v>

2242
01:36:28.540 --> 01:36:28.540

<v Speaker 3>Panther Comic Luke Cage.</v>

2261
01:37:16.010 --> 01:37:21.010
<v Speaker 3>Looks like a guy who could lay pipe the </v>
<v Speaker 3>pipe.</v>

2262
01:37:24.820 --> 01:37:25.820
<v Speaker 3>If you look at them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go,</v>

2263
01:37:25.821 --> 01:37:28.010

<v Speaker 3>That guy's was sex scenes.</v>

2264
01:37:28.011 --> 01:37:31.210
<v Speaker 3>Was there a rumor that they really were </v>
<v Speaker 3>having sex on camera work?</v>

2265
01:37:31.220 --> 01:37:32.760
<v Speaker 3>It was a big one in that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Angel Heart.</v>

2266
01:37:32.790 --> 01:37:35.570
<v Speaker 3>It's never been true time that natural </v>
<v Speaker 3>at all.</v>

2267
01:37:35.990 --> 01:37:36.930
<v Speaker 3>Angel Hearts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never true.</v>

2268
01:37:37.070 --> 01:37:39.470
<v Speaker 3>I think if Donald Sutherland in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>killer midget movie,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I mean you're so anti religion.</v>

2273
01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:52.100
<v Speaker 3>You don't even want to believe rumors.</v>

2274
01:37:57.700 --> 01:38:02.700
<v Speaker 3>I'm not buying it is witness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me tell you this.</v>

2275
01:38:03.880 --> 01:38:06.030
<v Speaker 3>It's like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I stopped at a crack.</v>

<v Speaker 3>My back was fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My first,</v>

2280
01:38:23.550 --> 01:38:23.570
<v Speaker 3>would go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you ever tell anybody what I did too,</v>

2281
01:38:23.580 --> 01:38:27.270

<v Speaker 3>And I told everybody as your first joke,</v>

2282

<v Speaker 3>I told everybody he never killed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My parents are,</v>

<v Speaker 3>joke at all for the fucking weird </v>

<v Speaker 3>They see it as weakness.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2307

<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2308
01:39:26.460 --> 01:39:27.930
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2310
01:39:31.321 --> 01:39:36.321
<v Speaker 3>The worst is when someone pretends </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're reading their notes and they do </v>

2311
01:39:36.321 --> 01:39:38.070
<v Speaker 3>the same bits over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you can't.</v>

2312
01:39:38.310 --> 01:39:43.310
<v Speaker 3>You just pretended.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just looked in that book and the </v>

2313
01:39:43.310 --> 01:39:43.860
<v Speaker 3>name for now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What else?</v>

<v Speaker 3>What else?</v>

2315
01:39:46.140 --> 01:39:48.780
<v Speaker 3>What else?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What else does that?</v>

2316
01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:50.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could do your act.</v>

2317
01:39:51.090 --> 01:39:56.090
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just like people in the audience </v>

2318
01:39:56.090 --> 01:39:56.090
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

2319
01:39:56.090 --> 01:39:56.090
<v Speaker 3>don't don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2320
01:39:56.090 --> 01:39:56.090
<v Speaker 3>Jay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2321
01:39:56.090 --> 01:39:56.580
<v Speaker 3>Big J.</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

2322
01:39:56.760 --> 01:40:01.760
<v Speaker 3>Were these people called them comics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I a comedy pause when they're not </v>

2323
01:40:04.831 --> 01:40:09.831
<v Speaker 3>really saying like spinning the wheels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trying to get some traction.</v>

2324
01:40:11.250 --> 01:40:16.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some new thing that I think </v>

2325
01:40:16.250 --> 01:40:18.681
<v Speaker 3>people have mistaken laughter for </v>
<v Speaker 3>support or like a pr or do you stitch </v>

2326
01:40:18.681 --> 01:40:19.860
<v Speaker 3>you say that to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they mistake it for applause.</v>

2327
01:40:20.210 --> 01:40:22.170
<v Speaker 3>W they've confused laughter and </v>
<v Speaker 3>applause.</v>

2328
01:40:22.590 --> 01:40:25.320
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an ideology versus like laughter's.</v>

2329
01:40:25.321 --> 01:40:27.600
<v Speaker 3>When someone relates applause is when </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone agrees.</v>

2330
01:40:27.750 --> 01:40:29.900
<v Speaker 3>Well there's too many people that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying for applause.</v>

2331
01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:31.370
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My point is like the.</v>

2332
01:40:31.400 --> 01:40:33.270
<v Speaker 3>You're supposed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is only supposed to be funny,</v>

2333
01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:38.600
<v Speaker 3>like when you're just trying to like say</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of Shit and memorize it and say </v>

2334
01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:39.860
<v Speaker 3>it real fast and then to get a big </v>
<v Speaker 3>applause at the end.</v>

2335
01:40:39.860 --> 01:40:41.480
<v Speaker 3>Like that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember?</v>

2336
01:40:42.050 --> 01:40:42.820
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

2337
01:40:42.890 --> 01:40:45.810
<v Speaker 3>I'm not trying to change policy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm starting to laugh,</v>

2338
01:40:45.811 --> 01:40:47.790
<v Speaker 3>but I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember like Eddie Murphy,</v>

2339
01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:53.440
<v Speaker 3>Eddie Murphy is the biggest county in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world and it's funny when it in the </v>

2340
01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:54.400
<v Speaker 3>eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember watching stand up.</v>

2341
01:40:54.430 --> 01:40:59.430
<v Speaker 3>It seemed more integrated or something </v>
<v Speaker 3>like in the eighties and I swear to God </v>

2342
01:40:59.430 --> 01:41:03.340
<v Speaker 3>like when the evening at the Improv in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>comic strip live or on tv on like Friday</v>

2343
01:41:03.341 --> 01:41:08.341
<v Speaker 3>night or that's what I used to watch </v>
<v Speaker 3>stand up comedy when I was like 11 or </v>

2344
01:41:08.341 --> 01:41:08.560
<v Speaker 3>12.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the nine like death.</v>

2345
01:41:08.680 --> 01:41:11.260
<v Speaker 3>I remember when def jam came out and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>remember it was like,</v>

2346
01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:14.290
<v Speaker 3>and also racially a lot of shit seemed </v>
<v Speaker 3>more segregated and it was like,</v>

2347
01:41:14.291 --> 01:41:17.110
<v Speaker 3>I think the beginning of just marketing </v>
<v Speaker 3>to specific,</v>

2348
01:41:17.170 --> 01:41:18.430
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

2349
01:41:18.431 --> 01:41:19.900
<v Speaker 3>Like oh here's an all black show.</v>

2350
01:41:19.900 --> 01:41:24.900
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and these had jokes on Seinfeld about </v>

2351
01:41:24.900 --> 01:41:27.211
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Seinfeld's market was being eaten </v>

2352
01:41:27.211 --> 01:41:29.341
<v Speaker 3>away with def jam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His mother sang it to him and I didn't </v>

2353
01:41:29.341 --> 01:41:29.380
<v Speaker 3>think of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that was the beginning.</v>

2354
01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:32.440
<v Speaker 3>So now it's like everybody just </v>
<v Speaker 3>specifically,</v>

2355
01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:33.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like to hell.</v>

2356
01:41:33.931 --> 01:41:36.640
<v Speaker 3>It was like kind of grab bag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I'd watch standup it would be like,</v>

2357
01:41:36.641 --> 01:41:39.580
<v Speaker 3>you'd see like a Ventriloquist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd see like,</v>

2358
01:41:39.790 --> 01:41:40.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eddie,</v>

2359
01:41:40.420 --> 01:41:43.990
<v Speaker 3>Eddie Murphy kind of person and like </v>
<v Speaker 3>some fucking real dry person.</v>

2360
01:41:44.500 --> 01:41:47.770
<v Speaker 3>There'd be like La and it was more mixed</v>
<v Speaker 3>on its own.</v>

2361
01:41:47.771 --> 01:41:48.820
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2362
01:41:48.970 --> 01:41:50.410
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you the solution,</v>

2363
01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:55.880
<v Speaker 3>I think we should do some of those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a Rodney dangerfield type specials </v>

2364
01:41:55.880 --> 01:41:58.080
<v Speaker 3>I called Rodney would do a special on </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking of also.</v>

2365
01:41:58.260 --> 01:42:01.010
<v Speaker 3>But that dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we should do it also.</v>

2366
01:42:01.120 --> 01:42:02.180
<v Speaker 3>A lot of us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2367
01:42:02.350 --> 01:42:03.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to put out a special,</v>

2368
01:42:03.790 --> 01:42:08.790
<v Speaker 3>it takes you a couple of fucking years </v>
<v Speaker 3>or a year solid to have the material </v>

2369
01:42:08.790 --> 01:42:10.180
<v Speaker 3>locked down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rock and roll.</v>

2370
01:42:10.420 --> 01:42:13.120
<v Speaker 3>But if you're going to do 15 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you're a minimum by the way.</v>

2371
01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:14.920
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes that's not enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

2372
01:42:14.930 --> 01:42:15.260
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nice.</v>

2373
01:42:15.400 --> 01:42:20.400
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been doing a year and a half in </v>

2374
01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:20.400
<v Speaker 3>between specials and I think that's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>right amount of time.</v>

2375
01:42:21.640 --> 01:42:26.590
<v Speaker 3>I've got a nice juicy now two and six </v>
<v Speaker 3>months that either,</v>

2376
01:42:26.591 --> 01:42:30.870
<v Speaker 3>because that's shit gets hammered down </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a Samurai warrior with Louis on his</v>

2377
01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:35.880
<v Speaker 3>website and the fucking point is like if</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's more of those 15 minutes sets,</v>

2378
01:42:39.311 --> 01:42:41.800
<v Speaker 3>like you could come up with a 15 minute </v>
<v Speaker 3>set and a couple of months.</v>

2379
01:42:41.970 --> 01:42:42.760
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2380
01:42:42.761 --> 01:42:45.040
<v Speaker 3>you really could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would be locked in.</v>

2381
01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:45.880
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2382
01:42:45.881 --> 01:42:48.580
<v Speaker 3>And so if you were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you were doing something like that,</v>

2383
01:42:48.850 --> 01:42:53.850
<v Speaker 3>you could do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like get a prepared set over like three </v>

2384
01:42:53.850 --> 01:42:54.730
<v Speaker 3>or four months and have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2385
01:42:54.910 --> 01:42:56.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>in.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You'll know when to go do that with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>white precious.</v>

2390
01:43:05.261 --> 01:43:10.261
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have a booking agent for the </v>

2391
01:43:10.261 --> 01:43:11.821
<v Speaker 3>road.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I switched managers and I was like we </v>

2392

<v Speaker 3>can't take him until he fucking does,</v>

<v Speaker 3>so I had to do it in 15 minute chunks </v>

2395
01:43:18.601 --> 01:43:19.540
<v Speaker 3>around the city and just do a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>city spots.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is,</v>

<v Speaker 3>but I mean it was so fucking nerve </v>

2398
01:43:26.340 --> 01:43:26.590
<v Speaker 3>wracking because I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know I'm not preparing this properly.</v>

2399
01:43:26.610 --> 01:43:26.890
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

2400
01:43:26.891 --> 01:43:31.891
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I have to do these 15 minute </v>

2401
01:43:31.891 --> 01:43:32.560
<v Speaker 3>chunks of the material.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The really why didn't you catch yourself</v>

2402
01:43:32.561 --> 01:43:37.561
<v Speaker 3>on the road?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like small cloud had been writing a </v>

2403
01:43:37.561 --> 01:43:37.561
<v Speaker 3>lot and I just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

2404
01:43:37.561 --> 01:43:39.400
<v Speaker 3>I switched managers and I didn't have an</v>
<v Speaker 3>agent,</v>

2405
01:43:39.401 --> 01:43:42.610
<v Speaker 3>a book and I don't know how easy it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>to book you at this point.</v>

2406
01:43:42.860 --> 01:43:45.130
<v Speaker 3>Once I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once I have all these people were like,</v>

2407
01:43:45.131 --> 01:43:45.620
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2408
01:43:45.730 --> 01:43:48.820
<v Speaker 3>I'd banished to Kramer island.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't get them to do shit for me.</v>

2409
01:43:48.821 --> 01:43:51.010
<v Speaker 3>I found out it's actually very easy to </v>
<v Speaker 3>go book.</v>

2410
01:43:51.560 --> 01:43:51.860
<v Speaker 3>Like</v>

2411
01:43:52.250 --> 01:43:53.720
<v Speaker 4>people actually wanted to book me </v>
<v Speaker 4>everyday.</v>

2412
01:43:54.020 --> 01:43:56.320
<v Speaker 4>It turns out not everybody is in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>dipshit Colt.</v>

2413
01:43:56.640 --> 01:44:01.640
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way it seems when you like online a </v>

2414
01:44:01.640 --> 01:44:01.640
<v Speaker 4>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2415
01:44:01.640 --> 01:44:05.111
<v Speaker 4>I just think if you can clearly explain </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself and you can feel like,</v>

2416
01:44:05.601 --> 01:44:07.640
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't realize you don't get to see.</v>

2417
01:44:07.641 --> 01:44:08.960
<v Speaker 4>I used to go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2418
01:44:08.961 --> 01:44:13.961
<v Speaker 4>they could do it without you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't need you present to fucking </v>

2419
01:44:13.961 --> 01:44:13.961
<v Speaker 4>you up is whatever.</v>

<v Speaker 4>oh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then they will go.</v>

2421

<v Speaker 4>what did you say?</v>

2422
01:44:15.471 --> 01:44:17.090
<v Speaker 4>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't even bother with that,</v>

2423
01:44:17.180 --> 01:44:19.250
<v Speaker 4>but they don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people just want to burn.</v>

2424
01:44:19.270 --> 01:44:24.270
<v Speaker 4>You just saw your media is based on this</v>
<v Speaker 4>conflict now and the patrice used to </v>

2425
01:44:24.321 --> 01:44:24.710
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like,</v>

2426
01:44:24.711 --> 01:44:29.711
<v Speaker 4>they always need us to be at war,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they need men versus women in white </v>

2427
01:44:29.711 --> 01:44:33.161
<v Speaker 4>for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They always need that going all the </v>

2428
01:44:33.161 --> 01:44:33.161

<v Speaker 4>Gallcher and Hulk Hogan?</v>

<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't.</v>

2443
01:45:06.831 --> 01:45:11.831

<v Speaker 4>The New York Times is now fat girl's </v>

2444
01:45:11.831 --> 01:45:11.831
<v Speaker 4>diary basically like they never </v>
<v Speaker 4>should've been allowed.</v>

2445
01:45:11.831 --> 01:45:13.430
<v Speaker 4>My girlfriend made that up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't make that.</v>

2446
01:45:13.431 --> 01:45:15.580
<v Speaker 4>That's very funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he said Damn Shit.</v>

2447
01:45:15.710 --> 01:45:17.510
<v Speaker 4>And he's very funny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's what it is.</v>

2448
01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:20.900
<v Speaker 4>And nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean like if you read the article,</v>

2449

<v Speaker 4>there's no crime.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People just make up what?</v>

2450
01:45:22.890 --> 01:45:27.890
<v Speaker 4>Like what did Louis Do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I used to ask like when that should </v>

2451
01:45:27.890 --> 01:45:27.890
<v Speaker 4>happen to him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

2452
01:45:27.890 --> 01:45:28.670
<v Speaker 4>what's it Louis do wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they go,</v>

2453
01:45:28.760 --> 01:45:30.940
<v Speaker 4>well one time at work my boss grabbed my</v>
<v Speaker 4>tit.</v>

2454
01:45:30.990 --> 01:45:32.600
<v Speaker 4>I have my actual friend says to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2455
01:45:32.601 --> 01:45:35.930
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry I asked you what Louie did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not about that.</v>

2456
01:45:35.990 --> 01:45:39.230
<v Speaker 4>We're going to use him as a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>symbol because what did he do wrong?</v>

2457
01:45:39.231 --> 01:45:44.231
<v Speaker 4>Ask for consent for non in like what are</v>
<v Speaker 4>you talking about?</v>

2458
01:45:44.870 --> 01:45:47.600
<v Speaker 4>Like why would that have to come out and</v>
<v Speaker 4>why would that be anybody's business?</v>

2459
01:45:47.780 --> 01:45:50.690
<v Speaker 4>It's to make him look like he's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>Weinstein for comedy.</v>

2460
01:45:51.020 --> 01:45:52.160
<v Speaker 4>Like Harvey Weinstein.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2461
01:45:52.161 --> 01:45:53.120
<v Speaker 4>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Harvey Weinstein,</v>

2462
01:45:53.121 --> 01:45:55.400
<v Speaker 4>that's the old casting couch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I'm like,</v>

2463
01:45:55.401 --> 01:45:56.420
<v Speaker 4>good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get rid of that shit.</v>

2464
01:45:56.780 --> 01:46:01.100
<v Speaker 4>But they tried to paint Louis up a stand</v>
<v Speaker 4>up comic as if he's a producer director.</v>

2465
01:46:01.430 --> 01:46:04.340
<v Speaker 4>Like it is a conflict of interest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you have a producer come to my room,</v>

2466
01:46:04.341 --> 01:46:04.880
<v Speaker 4>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

2467
01:46:05.540 --> 01:46:08.870
<v Speaker 4>but another comedian at a festival,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's reasonable.</v>

2468
01:46:08.871 --> 01:46:11.150
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Might be fucking because you're not on a</v>

2469
01:46:11.151 --> 01:46:12.500
<v Speaker 4>different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The power level.</v>

2470
01:46:12.501 --> 01:46:17.501
<v Speaker 4>We're comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't work for a corporation </v>

2471
01:46:17.501 --> 01:46:17.501
<v Speaker 4>together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

2472
01:46:17.501 --> 01:46:18.360
<v Speaker 4>we're an independent company and make </v>
<v Speaker 4>companies can fuck with each other.</v>

2473
01:46:18.361 --> 01:46:23.361
<v Speaker 4>But also that what it was is just a </v>
<v Speaker 4>weird thing that he liked to do and what</v>

2474
01:46:23.541 --> 01:46:26.170
<v Speaker 4>they made it out to be is like a sexual </v>
<v Speaker 4>look.</v>

2475
01:46:26.171 --> 01:46:29.990
<v Speaker 4>Like he's fucking a Predator and there </v>
<v Speaker 4>was no such anything.</v>

2476
01:46:30.140 --> 01:46:32.330
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't never surprised.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People jerk.</v>

2477
01:46:32.331 --> 01:46:34.250
<v Speaker 4>And now I'm going off what Louis told </v>
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>

2478
01:46:34.590 --> 01:46:36.460
<v Speaker 4>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe lily,</v>

2483
01:46:47.890 --> 01:46:48.230
<v Speaker 4>stupid enough to just believe women like</v>
<v Speaker 4>women know way better.</v>

<v Speaker 4>sex shit back and forth like Weinstein,</v>

01:47:23.120 --> 01:47:23.400
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>will you watch me masturbate?</v>

2500
01:47:23.670 --> 01:47:24.750
<v Speaker 4>Somebody said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2501
01:47:24.870 --> 01:47:27.690
<v Speaker 4>you didn't masturbate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They went and said something reported or</v>

2502
01:47:27.691 --> 01:47:28.500
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Supposedly,</v>

2503
01:47:28.501 --> 01:47:33.501
<v Speaker 4>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the story of that that I know more </v>

2504
01:47:33.501 --> 01:47:33.501
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's despicable how they frame that.</v>

2505
01:47:33.501 --> 01:47:37.790
<v Speaker 4>The guitar comic thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely despicable how they frame </v>

2506
01:47:37.790 --> 01:47:37.790
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2507
01:47:39.510 --> 01:47:42.240
<v Speaker 4>Anybody read the article?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody did.</v>

2508
01:47:42.380 --> 01:47:44.030
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody reads the read.</v>

2509
01:47:44.860 --> 01:47:48.210
<v Speaker 4>I read it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He literally did nothing.</v>

2510
01:47:48.211 --> 01:47:50.760
<v Speaker 4>If you read John,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nevermind what I would know personally,</v>

2511
01:47:50.940 --> 01:47:53.160
<v Speaker 4>just read the article.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody bothered to.</v>

2512
01:47:53.550 --> 01:47:55.650
<v Speaker 4>So all this nonsense that everybody put </v>
<v Speaker 4>out of him.</v>

2513
01:47:55.651 --> 01:47:57.660
<v Speaker 4>Surprised whacking off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not even in there.</v>

2514
01:47:57.661 --> 01:47:58.920
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2515
01:47:59.010 --> 01:48:04.010
<v Speaker 4>like it's the first one is the guitar </v>
<v Speaker 4>duo that people thought were Garfunkel </v>

2516
01:48:04.010 --> 01:48:06.360
<v Speaker 4>and oates because all these young kids </v>
<v Speaker 4>can't imagine anything happening before.</v>

2517
01:48:06.390 --> 01:48:08.870
<v Speaker 4>Who took guitar?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Duo that Louis supposedly jerked dot.</v>

2518
01:48:08.940 --> 01:48:13.940
<v Speaker 4>You don't remember this now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why a lot of shit hard duo that </v>

2519
01:48:13.940 --> 01:48:15.790
<v Speaker 4>really jerked off in front of the New </v>
<v Speaker 4>York Times was like,</v>

2520
01:48:15.810 --> 01:48:17.970
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw like some of the headlines and saw</v>

2521
01:48:17.971 --> 01:48:20.470
<v Speaker 4>some people commenting it online.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's okay.</v>

2522
01:48:20.960 --> 01:48:23.250
<v Speaker 4>What do you just let me ask,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you guys think Louie did that he</v>

2523
01:48:23.251 --> 01:48:23.750
<v Speaker 4>got in trouble for?</v>

2524
01:48:23.760 --> 01:48:24.690
<v Speaker 4>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just curious.</v>

2525
01:48:24.691 --> 01:48:27.480
<v Speaker 4>Someone to master if he could masturbate</v>
<v Speaker 4>in front of him and then did it.</v>

2526
01:48:27.510 --> 01:48:28.960
<v Speaker 4>They said yes and he did it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

2527
01:48:29.800 --> 01:48:34.800
<v Speaker 4>Essentially asked it to people who said </v>
<v Speaker 4>no and they felt very uncomfortable and </v>

2528
01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:34.800
<v Speaker 4>they had to work with them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2529
01:48:34.860 --> 01:48:37.080
<v Speaker 4>That is the sexual harassment aspect of </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2530
01:48:37.440 --> 01:48:39.270
<v Speaker 4>That's the difference.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you're on a TV set,</v>

2531
01:48:39.500 --> 01:48:40.890
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the only one that I went.</v>

2532
01:48:40.910 --> 01:48:41.730
<v Speaker 4>I'd read and went,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

2533
01:48:41.731 --> 01:48:43.950
<v Speaker 4>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you were telling me something.</v>

2534
01:48:44.190 --> 01:48:46.500
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what I'm not going to.</v>

2535
01:48:46.710 --> 01:48:50.860
<v Speaker 4>He could say what he wants to explain </v>
<v Speaker 4>what I'm not gonna Take Shit.</v>

2536
01:48:50.861 --> 01:48:51.890
<v Speaker 4>That's what he told me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2537
01:48:52.150 --> 01:48:56.250
<v Speaker 4>no need no need to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I'll just add to the story.</v>

2538
01:48:56.300 --> 01:48:56.980
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

2539
01:48:56.981 --> 01:48:59.340
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's a flat out agenda here.</v>

2540
01:48:59.370 --> 01:49:02.000
<v Speaker 4>Now what's the agenda to ruin a guy who.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2541
01:49:02.010 --> 01:49:04.230
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's Mexican now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know it doesn't help his case.</v>

2542
01:49:08.370 --> 01:49:10.410
<v Speaker 4>This is like the Taliban,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this shit now.</v>

2543
01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:15.440
<v Speaker 4>Like they have to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I bet he's a fucking Buddhist statue </v>

2544
01:49:15.440 --> 01:49:15.840
<v Speaker 4>that has to be exploded.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you understand?</v>

2545
01:49:16.110 --> 01:49:18.240
<v Speaker 4>We now have to take all these unfunny </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

2546
01:49:18.480 --> 01:49:21.540
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That for political reasons and you can't</v>

2547
01:49:21.541 --> 01:49:26.541
<v Speaker 4>have evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if someone being funny that fits in </v>

2548
01:49:26.541 --> 01:49:26.541
<v Speaker 4>the wrong group,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no styling.</v>

2550
01:49:32.080 --> 01:49:32.310
<v Speaker 4>achieved anything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they got to remove it.</v>

2551
01:49:32.311 --> 01:49:35.430
<v Speaker 4>So we're gonna throw Louis away.</v>

01:49:35.431 --> 01:49:38.190
<v Speaker 4>We gonna throw him away with Harvey </v>
<v Speaker 4>Weinstein.</v>

2553
01:49:40.380 --> 01:49:41.730
<v Speaker 4>I'm sending you right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jamie.</v>

01:49:41.980 --> 01:49:43.560
<v Speaker 4>You got to put the shit up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to cry.</v>

2555
01:49:45.300 --> 01:49:45.810
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2556
01:49:45.811 --> 01:49:47.650
<v Speaker 4>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in some ways that,</v>

2557
01:49:47.651 --> 01:49:47.970
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

2558
01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:53.040
<v Speaker 3>there's a Taliban going on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if a guy like Harvey Weinstein </v>

2559
01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:53.080
<v Speaker 3>existed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2560
01:49:53.081 --> 01:49:56.650
<v Speaker 3>there was a real fucking problem for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of people for sure.</v>

2561
01:49:56.950 --> 01:49:58.180
<v Speaker 3>A hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

2562
01:49:58.181 --> 01:50:00.910
<v Speaker 3>Hollywood's fucking despicable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Both things.</v>

2563
01:50:00.940 --> 01:50:03.640
<v Speaker 3>What you're saying is true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's true,</v>

2564
01:50:03.730 --> 01:50:08.730
<v Speaker 3>but the idea that another comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because back when this happened at </v>

2565
01:50:08.730 --> 01:50:09.360
<v Speaker 3>Aspen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was not a fucking.</v>

2566
01:50:09.450 --> 01:50:11.830
<v Speaker 3>He was a comedian who was a few more </v>
<v Speaker 3>years ahead.</v>

2567
01:50:12.190 --> 01:50:14.050
<v Speaker 3>Then these two girls that were also </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedians.</v>

2568
01:50:14.140 --> 01:50:16.960
<v Speaker 3>I've been at festivals and had sex with </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedians.</v>

2569
01:50:17.020 --> 01:50:21.050
<v Speaker 3>This is outrageous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you should have done on the internet</v>

2570
01:50:21.060 --> 01:50:26.060
<v Speaker 3>or even industry and shit out of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>girls attractive and you were attracted </v>

2571
01:50:26.060 --> 01:50:28.240
<v Speaker 3>to them and you guys had consensual sex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what you're saying?</v>

2572
01:50:28.300 --> 01:50:30.620
<v Speaker 3>Just rape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck did that?</v>

2573
01:50:30.700 --> 01:50:32.270
<v Speaker 3>Or as it's known now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Reagan,</v>

2574
01:50:32.280 --> 01:50:36.040
<v Speaker 3>this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>88 percent of white wealth is duty,</v>

2575
01:50:36.340 --> 01:50:38.260
<v Speaker 3>honor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a privilege to get a t shirt on.</v>

2576
01:50:38.410 --> 01:50:41.360
<v Speaker 3>I hope that that's not really his shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope someone,</v>

2577
01:50:41.361 --> 01:50:44.750
<v Speaker 3>he thinks he's a fucker and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they photoshop that shit out a shirt.</v>

2578
01:50:45.100 --> 01:50:48.780
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that's fucking despicable it.</v>

2579
01:50:48.790 --> 01:50:53.790
<v Speaker 3>Because first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does that have to do with me at </v>

2580
01:50:53.790 --> 01:50:56.161
<v Speaker 3>all?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like let's say if I earn something for </v>

2581
01:50:56.161 --> 01:50:56.161
<v Speaker 3>70 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not in that.</v>

2582
01:50:56.161 --> 01:50:58.330
<v Speaker 3>When you throw those numbers up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to see studies.</v>

2583
01:50:58.540 --> 01:51:00.870
<v Speaker 3>I want to see 88 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What would that do?</v>

2584
01:51:00.940 --> 01:51:03.370
<v Speaker 3>Very specific number Geno.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See what do you not notice?</v>

2585
01:51:03.371 --> 01:51:06.910
<v Speaker 3>The fucking shit that the white,</v>
<v Speaker 3>white,</v>

2586
01:51:07.210 --> 01:51:09.880
<v Speaker 3>young,</v>
<v Speaker 3>white woman led fucking movement.</v>

2587
01:51:09.881 --> 01:51:14.881
<v Speaker 3>The social jihadis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just fighting for the right to </v>

2588
01:51:14.881 --> 01:51:15.130
<v Speaker 3>do white men what they've always done to</v>
<v Speaker 3>black men,</v>

2589
01:51:15.490 --> 01:51:16.780
<v Speaker 3>which is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he scared me.</v>

2590
01:51:16.781 --> 01:51:17.710
<v Speaker 3>I want him fired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2591
01:51:17.730 --> 01:51:19.920
<v Speaker 3>it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's scrubbing all the meds,</v>

2592
01:51:19.930 --> 01:51:22.810
<v Speaker 3>so congratulations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get to be like an inward now.</v>

2593
01:51:22.870 --> 01:51:27.870
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's also toxic femininity where it's </v>

2594
01:51:27.870 --> 01:51:29.791
<v Speaker 3>like the way a lot of women's instincts </v>
<v Speaker 3>are based around keeping a toddler away </v>

2595
01:51:29.791 --> 01:51:31.540
<v Speaker 3>from Mike light sockets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's like whatever they do,</v>

2596
01:51:31.541 --> 01:51:36.541
<v Speaker 3>it's all good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not the field instinct to do that </v>

2597
01:51:36.541 --> 01:51:36.541
<v Speaker 3>too as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hold on,</v>

2598
01:51:36.541 --> 01:51:38.590
<v Speaker 3>keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Keep the father away from a life socket.</v>

2599
01:51:38.850 --> 01:51:43.850
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like women are more designed in general </v>

2600
01:51:43.850 --> 01:51:47.641
<v Speaker 3>to take care of very young children and </v>
<v Speaker 3>men are more like seven onward where </v>

2601
01:51:47.641 --> 01:51:51.271
<v Speaker 3>it's like if you fall down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you hurt yourself and you learn your </v>

2602
01:51:51.271 --> 01:51:51.271
<v Speaker 3>lesson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now get out there.</v>

2603
01:51:51.271 --> 01:51:55.620
<v Speaker 3>Just the design that makes them do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you mean ergonomically designed </v>

2604
01:51:56.140 --> 01:51:59.580
<v Speaker 3>or how would they know emotionally wired</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do that where it's like women.</v>

2605
01:51:59.630 --> 01:52:02.110
<v Speaker 3>Once my wife first had a baby,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really was like,</v>

2606
01:52:02.350 --> 01:52:03.670
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is like.</v>

2607
01:52:03.671 --> 01:52:05.890
<v Speaker 3>Makes perfect sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why they have bras.</v>

2608
01:52:06.190 --> 01:52:07.400
<v Speaker 3>You feed a baby,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2609
01:52:07.401 --> 01:52:08.980
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2610
01:52:08.981 --> 01:52:10.810
<v Speaker 3>Well I don't think that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2611
01:52:10.890 --> 01:52:15.890
<v Speaker 3>but that's what I mean though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of like a lot of the this sjw </v>

2612
01:52:15.890 --> 01:52:17.500
<v Speaker 3>mentality is that safe space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if there's a group of people,</v>

2613
01:52:17.501 --> 01:52:19.810
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing they could possibly have</v>
<v Speaker 3>done wrong,</v>

2614
01:52:19.970 --> 01:52:23.200
<v Speaker 3>but protect at all costs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Almost maternal.</v>

2615
01:52:23.230 --> 01:52:26.290
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maternal.</v>

2616
01:52:26.291 --> 01:52:31.291
<v Speaker 3>I mean like this is the thing that makes</v>
<v Speaker 3>me laugh and that's the point I was </v>

2617
01:52:31.291 --> 01:52:33.871
<v Speaker 3>making.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to bother you want to mother </v>

2618
01:52:33.871 --> 01:52:33.871
<v Speaker 3>society,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you,</v>

2619
01:52:33.871 --> 01:52:34.880
<v Speaker 3>you killed your babies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't yet have.</v>

2620
01:52:35.190 --> 01:52:37.410
<v Speaker 3>You shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have board us.</v>

2621
01:52:37.690 --> 01:52:42.690
<v Speaker 3>They didn't kill their babies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you throw in the ones that got </v>

2622
01:52:42.690 --> 01:52:45.010
<v Speaker 3>abortions in and they're all </v>
<v Speaker 3>contaminants on the clergy.</v>

2623
01:52:45.060 --> 01:52:48.890
<v Speaker 3>On the levy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Specifically the online feminist clergy,</v>

2624
01:52:49.010 --> 01:52:50.330
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>To have an abortion,</v>

2625
01:52:50.331 --> 01:52:55.100
<v Speaker 3>you get in the club,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to show you receipt card.</v>

2626
01:52:55.310 --> 01:52:57.500
<v Speaker 3>Lena Dunham is the classic because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>feel bad for her.</v>

2627
01:52:57.501 --> 01:52:59.990
<v Speaker 3>It's like she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just want to be good in my church.</v>

2628
01:53:01.050 --> 01:53:03.890
<v Speaker 3>I'm the guy who worked for me didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>commit rape.</v>

2629
01:53:03.920 --> 01:53:05.450
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry he did this.</v>

2630
01:53:05.610 --> 01:53:07.220
<v Speaker 3>Communism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This isn't harmless.</v>

2631
01:53:07.221 --> 01:53:12.221
<v Speaker 3>The body's stack like the number one </v>
<v Speaker 3>death of the 20th century was your own </v>

2632
01:53:12.221 --> 01:53:12.520
<v Speaker 3>government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My own.</v>

2633
01:53:12.590 --> 01:53:13.100
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>

2634
01:53:13.220 --> 01:53:15.010
<v Speaker 3>who you talking to me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who's me?</v>

2635
01:53:15.730 --> 01:53:20.210
<v Speaker 3>You people and us like human government </v>
<v Speaker 3>is 60 million Russians,</v>

2636
01:53:20.660 --> 01:53:23.710
<v Speaker 3>a 60 million Chinese and he got Hitler.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He got like that.</v>

2637
01:53:24.140 --> 01:53:26.570
<v Speaker 3>Are we in of so high?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are we in Russia?</v>

2638
01:53:26.600 --> 01:53:27.180
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean by that?</v>

2639
01:53:29.530 --> 01:53:32.510
<v Speaker 3>When you say your own government </v>
<v Speaker 3>inclusivity,</v>

2640
01:53:32.511 --> 01:53:37.511
<v Speaker 3>all that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it all leads to like the way to make a </v>

2641
01:53:37.511 --> 01:53:37.730
<v Speaker 3>forest equal is with an ax.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

2642
01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.820
<v Speaker 3>And the tallest nail gets hammered down </v>
<v Speaker 3>like these are all and we're starting to</v>

2643
01:53:40.821 --> 01:53:45.821
<v Speaker 3>enter like a upside down world and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>left or the right wing tyranny is more </v>

2644
01:53:48.141 --> 01:53:50.300
<v Speaker 3>sexy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why you hear about Hitler because</v>

2645
01:53:50.301 --> 01:53:52.460
<v Speaker 3>he's an evil guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at least he had like great boots and</v>

2646
01:53:52.461 --> 01:53:55.520
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like the styling is a bean counter.</v>

2647
01:53:55.550 --> 01:53:58.670
<v Speaker 3>That's why he has way bigger death cap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We never hear about it because he's just</v>

2648
01:53:58.671 --> 01:54:00.170
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let them starve.</v>

2649
01:54:00.171 --> 01:54:05.171
<v Speaker 3>We thought stolen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always would always read about Stalin </v>

2650
01:54:05.171 --> 01:54:06.580
<v Speaker 3>was he was Kinda like a meathead and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Lenin was the intellectual install,</v>

2651
01:54:07.360 --> 01:54:10.370
<v Speaker 3>like the muscle that kind of crept up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was just like a fucking,</v>

2652
01:54:10.371 --> 01:54:11.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>am I wrong in that?</v>

2653
01:54:12.210 --> 01:54:14.360
<v Speaker 3>That's what I know of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lenin was a little bit of both.</v>

2654
01:54:14.361 --> 01:54:15.740
<v Speaker 3>He was in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was an ideologue.</v>

2655
01:54:15.770 --> 01:54:18.380
<v Speaker 3>Did you read the Shit of classified </v>
<v Speaker 3>when?</v>

2656
01:54:18.390 --> 01:54:18.830
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2657
01:54:18.920 --> 01:54:20.930
<v Speaker 3>from Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That stuff's donald had them working on.</v>

2658
01:54:20.931 --> 01:54:25.931
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wanted to make these gorilla human </v>

2659
01:54:25.931 --> 01:54:27.911
<v Speaker 3>hybrid soldiers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is when they couldn't say no to </v>

2660
01:54:27.911 --> 01:54:28.040
<v Speaker 3>Stalin like the later years where </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever he said,</v>

2661
01:54:28.041 --> 01:54:28.550
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2662
01:54:28.570 --> 01:54:29.960
<v Speaker 3>Stalin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

2663
01:54:29.961 --> 01:54:32.270
<v Speaker 3>make gorilla soldiers that don't have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>eat very much.</v>

2664
01:54:32.271 --> 01:54:32.810
<v Speaker 3>And then they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2665
01:54:32.811 --> 01:54:34.750
<v Speaker 3>gorilla is actually eat all day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might not be,</v>

2666
01:54:35.130 --> 01:54:39.950
<v Speaker 3>but don't let the soldiers that don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>have man,</v>

2667
01:54:39.951 --> 01:54:42.440
<v Speaker 3>half gorilla soldiers so that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't have to eat a lot.</v>

2668
01:54:42.470 --> 01:54:43.430
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy.</v>

2669
01:54:43.431 --> 01:54:44.390
<v Speaker 3>This shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2670
01:54:44.391 --> 01:54:49.391
<v Speaker 3>if you stop clapping first he killed you</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's this one time where there's </v>

2671
01:54:49.391 --> 01:54:50.750
<v Speaker 3>nine straight minutes of everyone </v>
<v Speaker 3>clapping and like,</v>

2672
01:54:50.810 --> 01:54:55.810
<v Speaker 3>because they knew the people knew that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the first one is stop is going to die </v>

2673
01:54:55.810 --> 01:54:59.760
<v Speaker 3>and someone finally passed out and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>killed them yet because that's how far </v>

2674
01:54:59.760 --> 01:55:00.140
<v Speaker 3>compliance goes.</v>

2675
01:55:00.440 --> 01:55:02.660
<v Speaker 3>It's just they keep getting you to </v>
<v Speaker 3>comply,</v>

2676
01:55:02.690 --> 01:55:03.620
<v Speaker 3>comply,</v>
<v Speaker 3>comply.</v>

2677
01:55:03.621 --> 01:55:08.621
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a question I want to know about </v>

2678
01:55:08.621 --> 01:55:08.621
<v Speaker 3>guns and abortion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like what?</v>

2679
01:55:08.621 --> 01:55:10.340
<v Speaker 3>Where's the line?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because if you can't determine it,</v>

2680
01:55:10.740 --> 01:55:15.740
<v Speaker 3>someone's when like you were saying like</v>
<v Speaker 3>when do you think it's okay or not okay </v>

2681
01:55:15.951 --> 01:55:20.951
<v Speaker 3>to have an abortion?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You wait is a good fucking one day </v>

2682
01:55:20.951 --> 01:55:22.400
<v Speaker 3>before too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>On both sides.</v>

2683
01:55:22.850 --> 01:55:24.920
<v Speaker 3>There's an unreasonable argument on both</v>
<v Speaker 3>sides.</v>

2684
01:55:25.040 --> 01:55:26.480
<v Speaker 3>They're not willing to give it up at </v>
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>

2685
01:55:26.570 --> 01:55:27.470
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>On both sides.</v>

2686
01:55:27.530 --> 01:55:28.340
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's funny man,</v>

2687
01:55:28.341 --> 01:55:33.341
<v Speaker 3>because like I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said I don't care about all your </v>

2688
01:55:33.341 --> 01:55:33.341
<v Speaker 3>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>

2689
01:55:33.341 --> 01:55:34.360
<v Speaker 3>I don't get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't get aggressive opening statement</v>

2690
01:55:34.380 --> 01:55:36.230
<v Speaker 3>but I don't get that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Having been said,</v>

2691
01:55:36.260 --> 01:55:38.360
<v Speaker 3>I don't get why the only thing we can do</v>
<v Speaker 3>is nothing.</v>

2692
01:55:38.361 --> 01:55:39.470
<v Speaker 3>Like they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm very sorry.</v>

2693
01:55:39.471 --> 01:55:41.060
<v Speaker 3>There's absolutely nothing that can help</v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

2694
01:55:41.240 --> 01:55:44.100
<v Speaker 3>But if you're a gun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a gun lover or just</v>

2695
01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:49.100
<v Speaker 1>shoot her or know anything about guns </v>
<v Speaker 1>and someone says air 15 and they don't </v>

2696
01:55:49.100 --> 01:55:52.250
<v Speaker 1>realize that a 10 is the same gun except</v>
<v Speaker 1>with bigger bullets or an sks or are </v>

2697
01:55:52.250 --> 01:55:56.751
<v Speaker 1>that automatic guns are already illegal </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they want to like band something </v>

2698
01:55:56.751 --> 01:56:01.221
<v Speaker 1>they don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there is no such thing as an </v>

2699
01:56:01.221 --> 01:56:01.260
<v Speaker 1>assault rifle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't make any sense.</v>

2700
01:56:02.010 --> 01:56:03.830
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you call it an assault rifle.</v>

2701
01:56:04.010 --> 01:56:07.830
<v Speaker 1>You noise with your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who Cares?</v>

2702
01:56:07.900 --> 01:56:12.900
<v Speaker 1>We'll do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The point is there's guns that didn't </v>

2703
01:56:12.900 --> 01:56:12.900
<v Speaker 1>shoot a bunch of people really easy </v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

2704
01:56:12.900 --> 01:56:16.610
<v Speaker 1>You have ar 50.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know what's going on.</v>

2705
01:56:16.890 --> 01:56:21.890
<v Speaker 1>Is it guns killing people like all this </v>
<v Speaker 1>other stuff is nonsense and people get </v>

2706
01:56:21.890 --> 01:56:22.250
<v Speaker 1>lost up in the minutia of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>

2707
01:56:22.260 --> 01:56:24.590
<v Speaker 1>they don't know the names.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's a bump stock do,</v>

2708
01:56:24.600 --> 01:56:29.600
<v Speaker 1>do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I was in South Dakota not long ago </v>

2709
01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:29.600
<v Speaker 1>and the dude I was hanging out with like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a doomsday prepper.</v>

2710
01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:34.371

<v Speaker 1>he's like a nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same canned peaches.</v>

<v Speaker 1>don't call me that guy man bro.</v>

<v Speaker 1>How many cans are gonna need?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thirty years worth.</v>

2714
01:56:48.490 --> 01:56:53.490
<v Speaker 1>Shit doesn't go bad bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good pitches are good when they're </v>

2715
01:56:53.490 --> 01:56:54.600
<v Speaker 1>fucking canned peaches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like in someone's basement.</v>

2716
01:56:54.601 --> 01:56:58.970
<v Speaker 1>How long has that shit last a while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like years does it last year's.</v>

2717
01:56:59.040 --> 01:57:01.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're designed for the apocalypse.</v>

2718
01:57:01.200 --> 01:57:02.880
<v Speaker 1>There's like 50 shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what they'll do.</v>

2719
01:57:02.881 --> 01:57:07.670
<v Speaker 1>They can cause he was doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not yet.</v>

2720
01:57:08.160 --> 01:57:10.290
<v Speaker 1>I swear to God told me he's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a Christian,</v>

2721
01:57:10.291 --> 01:57:11.680
<v Speaker 1>but he's not a good Christian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

01:57:15.300 --> 01:57:20.300
<v Speaker 1>He's not going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not going up in the first like </v>

2725
01:57:20.300 --> 01:57:20.300
<v Speaker 1>pickup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2726
01:57:20.300 --> 01:57:23.841
<v Speaker 1>he'll have to like the thing about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christian says you could always even on </v>

<v Speaker 1>except Jesus and you're not during.</v>

2728
01:57:29.850 --> 01:57:34.850
<v Speaker 1>Not during the great tribulation that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was planning to live through which the </v>

2729
01:57:34.850 --> 01:57:38.100
<v Speaker 1>stockpiles before it was going to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to live through that and then get caught</v>

2730
01:57:38.101 --> 01:57:41.270
<v Speaker 1>up in the second pickup.</v>

2731
01:57:41.280 --> 01:57:43.200
<v Speaker 1>He won't be the disappearing out of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>clothes guy.</v>

2732
01:57:43.260 --> 01:57:48.260
<v Speaker 1>The problem with where both of us live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and I is if the shit does hit the </v>

2733
01:57:48.260 --> 01:57:48.820
<v Speaker 1>fan,</v>

<v Speaker 1>far too many people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>too many people in Manhattan.</v>

2735
01:57:51.780 --> 01:57:53.970
<v Speaker 1>Too many people in here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It ain't good.</v>

2736
01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:59.000
<v Speaker 1>This is no Bueno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did carry that with the winter but.</v>

2737
01:57:59.110 --> 01:58:00.870
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a winter look,</v>

2738
01:58:00.871 --> 01:58:05.871
<v Speaker 1>if you don't have laws you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go out and you could whack 30 fucking </v>

2739
01:58:05.871 --> 01:58:07.260
<v Speaker 1>deer and stack those fuckers up in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>garage.</v>

2740
01:58:07.350 --> 01:58:09.450
<v Speaker 1>Like there's deer all over the place up </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2741
01:58:09.451 --> 01:58:14.451
<v Speaker 1>You are going to have fresh water </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere with your car and not even </v>

2742
01:58:14.451 --> 01:58:16.980
<v Speaker 1>wanting to do well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

2743
01:58:18.420 --> 01:58:21.600
<v Speaker 1>some places they allow you to pick that </v>
<v Speaker 1>deer up and take it home and eat it.</v>

2744
01:58:21.930 --> 01:58:24.720
<v Speaker 1>Like after you hit it with your car they</v>
<v Speaker 1>should for sure.</v>

2745
01:58:24.810 --> 01:58:26.400
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is that they were saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2746
01:58:26.401 --> 01:58:28.110
<v Speaker 1>what if people are targeting the deer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2747
01:58:28.120 --> 01:58:31.890
<v Speaker 1>well what could you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much it costs the damage that a deer</v>

2748
01:58:31.891 --> 01:58:34.470
<v Speaker 1>does your fucking car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they destroy your car.</v>

2749
01:58:34.471 --> 01:58:37.380
<v Speaker 1>Thousands of dollars of damage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck is going to do that?</v>

2750
01:58:37.500 --> 01:58:40.940
<v Speaker 1>And that's a lot of driving for a deer </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you could buy a tag for,</v>

2751
01:58:40.960 --> 01:58:43.660
<v Speaker 1>for like 50 bucks and kill with like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>knife,</v>

2752
01:58:43.820 --> 01:58:48.820
<v Speaker 1>like deer in my yard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Literally just be eating my flowers and </v>

01:58:56.510 --> 01:59:01.510
<v Speaker 1>you'll see a fucking giant mule deer </v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting on the side of the road eating </v>

2867
02:03:49.130 --> 02:03:52.190
<v Speaker 3>is that what was going on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was with them for when they hatch.</v>

2868
02:03:52.191 --> 02:03:54.260
<v Speaker 3>They would follow him around the second </v>
<v Speaker 3>they hit puberty.</v>

2869
02:03:54.261 --> 02:03:57.400
<v Speaker 3>They turn into prehistoric dinosaur.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vicious fucking.</v>

2874
02:04:05.840 --> 02:04:10.840
<v Speaker 3>And this is what to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you should watch this as soon as </v>

2875

<v Speaker 3>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope I'm not remembering this wrong </v>

2876
02:04:12.881 --> 02:04:12.881
<v Speaker 3>highlight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I swear to God.</v>

<v Speaker 3>So Turkey boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one day just fucking turned on him and </v>

2878
02:04:16.120 --> 02:04:16.120
<v Speaker 3>attack him and went for his eye.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They go for your eyes.</v>

2879
02:04:17.030 --> 02:04:18.110
<v Speaker 3>Favorite Turkey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Turkey boy.</v>

2880
02:04:18.111 --> 02:04:23.111

<v Speaker 3>I thought that was going to be an in </v>

2881
02:04:23.111 --> 02:04:23.111
<v Speaker 3>Turkey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boy wouldn't have no,</v>

2882
02:04:23.111 --> 02:04:24.820
<v Speaker 3>he went for his eyes and a state show </v>
<v Speaker 3>reenactment with uh,</v>

2883
02:04:24.830 --> 02:04:27.470
<v Speaker 3>another like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like an after Turkey.</v>

2884
02:04:27.560 --> 02:04:32.060
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how they did it was in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>union because Turkey is just go for your</v>

2885
02:04:32.061 --> 02:04:33.140
<v Speaker 3>fucking eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2886
02:04:33.141 --> 02:04:35.450
<v Speaker 3>You don't need a lot of training and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they visit Turkey.</v>

2887
02:04:35.600 --> 02:04:38.110
<v Speaker 3>But my joke is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you know as a live Turkey is</v>

2888
02:04:38.110 --> 02:04:40.750
<v Speaker 1>a huge size of Kat Williams and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2889
02:04:41.450 --> 02:04:45.440
<v Speaker 1>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and his buddies probably didn't get very</v>

2890
02:04:45.910 --> 02:04:50.910
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They probably weren't too compassionate </v>

2891
02:04:50.910 --> 02:04:50.910
<v Speaker 1>when they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

2892
02:04:50.910 --> 02:04:51.060
<v Speaker 1>Why did he turn on me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I shouldn't trust the Turkey.</v>

2893
02:04:51.061 --> 02:04:53.010
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking Turkey,</v>

2894
02:04:53.011 --> 02:04:54.450
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you think about a chicken.</v>

2895
02:04:54.480 --> 02:04:57.250
<v Speaker 1>Chicken's a ruthless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then now think about a Turkey.</v>

2896
02:04:57.310 --> 02:05:02.310
<v Speaker 1>Turkey's are giant chickens when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't been bread and all the trees </v>

2897
02:05:02.310 --> 02:05:05.970
<v Speaker 1>where my grandfather lived in Florida </v>
<v Speaker 1>before he died,</v>

2898
02:05:06.330 --> 02:05:11.330
<v Speaker 1>there was all these feral cats and </v>
<v Speaker 1>chickens on their property and we feed </v>

2899
02:05:11.330 --> 02:05:11.330
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He put this big feeder out.</v>

2900
02:05:11.330 --> 02:05:16.070
<v Speaker 1>It was amazing how they formed a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>society because it will be a kitten or </v>

2901
02:05:16.070 --> 02:05:16.070
<v Speaker 1>cat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a chicken catcher.</v>

2902
02:05:16.070 --> 02:05:18.420
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have any interaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just all came and ate the food.</v>

2903
02:05:18.450 --> 02:05:19.590
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2904
02:05:19.591 --> 02:05:21.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're watching it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just crazy.</v>

2905
02:05:21.181 --> 02:05:23.400
<v Speaker 1>And they were listening to the cast and </v>
<v Speaker 1>kill the little chickens.</v>

2906
02:05:23.430 --> 02:05:25.590
<v Speaker 1>Not even at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A little bit crazy.</v>

2907
02:05:25.750 --> 02:05:30.750
<v Speaker 1>There's just plenty of food that's super</v>
<v Speaker 1>rare that a feral cat can keep it </v>

2908
02:05:30.750 --> 02:05:34.761
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have never thought that until I </v>

2909
02:05:34.761 --> 02:05:34.761
<v Speaker 1>was watching them do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was adorable.</v>

2910
02:05:34.761 --> 02:05:34.761
<v Speaker 1>You don't see the numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Disney movie.</v>

2911
02:05:34.761 --> 02:05:37.680
<v Speaker 1>See the numbers of birds that feral cats</v>
<v Speaker 1>killed in America every year.</v>

2912
02:05:38.010 --> 02:05:39.860
<v Speaker 1>It's in the billions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do we need them to do it?</v>

2913
02:05:40.310 --> 02:05:41.490
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably,</v>

2914
02:05:41.580 --> 02:05:42.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you think about it,</v>

2915
02:05:42.451 --> 02:05:44.670
<v Speaker 1>we probably do because in Israel they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>like rats.</v>

2916
02:05:44.671 --> 02:05:45.090
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2917
02:05:45.120 --> 02:05:47.610
<v Speaker 1>my ex Israeli,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she told me they're like cats or not.</v>

2918
02:05:48.150 --> 02:05:50.700
<v Speaker 1>Same with Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lost a chicken to a coyote last night.</v>

2919
02:05:51.030 --> 02:05:53.530
<v Speaker 1>I had to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>finish the chicken off with my chickens.</v>

2920
02:05:53.850 --> 02:05:55.680
<v Speaker 1>I had a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had a coyote in the yard,</v>

2921
02:05:55.710 --> 02:05:57.510
<v Speaker 1>caught it in the yard by the chickens </v>
<v Speaker 1>were out.</v>

2922
02:05:57.570 --> 02:06:02.570
<v Speaker 1>What do you walked up on the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>chicken coop and jumped over and it </v>

2923
02:06:02.570 --> 02:06:02.570
<v Speaker 1>chased a couple oven bit.</v>

2924

<v Speaker 1>some feathers loose,</v>

2925
02:06:04.801 --> 02:06:07.020
<v Speaker 1>but one of them it actually got and </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed.</v>

2926
02:06:07.080 --> 02:06:08.550
<v Speaker 1>It's wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's coyotes here.</v>

2927
02:06:08.670 --> 02:06:09.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh Dude,</v>

<v Speaker 1>once.</v>

<v Speaker 1>daughter's bunny walk in and all these </v>

<v Speaker 1>Especially when I give them these little</v>

2958
02:07:30.961 --> 02:07:33.260
<v Speaker 1>worm treats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's these dried mealworms.</v>

2959
02:07:33.390 --> 02:07:36.110
<v Speaker 1>They fucking love these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go crazy for them so I can.</v>

2960
02:07:36.220 --> 02:07:37.960
<v Speaker 2>That's how I get them back into their </v>
<v Speaker 2>chicken coop.</v>

2961
02:07:37.961 --> 02:07:42.961
<v Speaker 2>They were pretty big chicken coop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when they wanted or the yard and I </v>

2962

<v Speaker 2>Chow.</v>

2964
02:07:43.860 --> 02:07:48.860
<v Speaker 2>They come running to me and then I give </v>
<v Speaker 2>him a little treat every time so that </v>

2965
02:07:48.860 --> 02:07:49.630
<v Speaker 2>they know that every time I shaky,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you've never seen as something attack </v>
<v Speaker 2>worms with the kind of passion and vigor</v>

2970
02:07:59.090 --> 02:08:00.230

<v Speaker 4>I'd say I've seen it.</v>

2971
02:08:00.231 --> 02:08:01.830
<v Speaker 4>It's terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'll eat chicken.</v>

2972
02:08:03.490 --> 02:08:04.280
<v Speaker 4>You see?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2974
02:08:07.170 --> 02:08:12.170
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fighting roosters and I went to Hawaii </v>

2975
02:08:12.170 --> 02:08:14.931
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>roosters are way different than hence </v>

2976
02:08:14.931 --> 02:08:14.931
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no rape the shit out of anybody.</v>

2977
02:08:14.931 --> 02:08:16.420
<v Speaker 4>And they also just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2978
02:08:16.430 --> 02:08:18.150
<v Speaker 4>they're fucking crazy about to say same </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

2979
02:08:18.151 --> 02:08:18.480
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2980
02:08:18.481 --> 02:08:23.481
<v Speaker 4>you have a different point than me in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Hawaii there had been a hurricane and </v>

2981
02:08:23.481 --> 02:08:23.820
<v Speaker 4>like these people had chickens like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2982
02:08:23.821 --> 02:08:25.290
<v Speaker 4>that it got it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So on the street corners,</v>

2983
02:08:25.291 --> 02:08:27.150
<v Speaker 4>it made me laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would look like a pimp.</v>

2984
02:08:27.510 --> 02:08:32.510
<v Speaker 4>It'd be like one rooster and then like a</v>
<v Speaker 4>bunch of hens behind him and he would </v>

2985
02:08:32.510 --> 02:08:34.130
<v Speaker 4>just go around the corner and he was a </v>
<v Speaker 4>wild chasing Hawaii every quarter.</v>

2986
02:08:34.170 --> 02:08:35.720
<v Speaker 4>Just see roosters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2987
02:08:35.790 --> 02:08:37.120
<v Speaker 4>Wild chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

2988
02:08:37.740 --> 02:08:39.630
<v Speaker 4>I keep forgetting why you brought this </v>
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>

2989
02:08:39.710 --> 02:08:42.990
<v Speaker 4>Maybe because I've been in Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2990
02:08:42.991 --> 02:08:45.570
<v Speaker 4>well rapey roosters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bird the fight,</v>

2991
02:08:46.490 --> 02:08:48.520
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because you know,</v>

2992
02:08:48.560 --> 02:08:51.510
<v Speaker 4>it's like when they go to rescue the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fighting roosters,</v>

2993
02:08:51.660 --> 02:08:56.660
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know they just killed them </v>
<v Speaker 4>because that's all they want to do is </v>

2994
02:08:56.660 --> 02:08:56.660
<v Speaker 4>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they just fucking,</v>

2995
02:08:56.660 --> 02:08:58.220
<v Speaker 4>if they bust one of those rings up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just put the route,</v>

2996
02:08:58.410 --> 02:09:00.390
<v Speaker 4>like just let him fucking fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If that's what they're into,</v>

2997
02:09:00.480 --> 02:09:01.830
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't seem.</v>

2998
02:09:02.880 --> 02:09:05.600
<v Speaker 4>They get them adopted or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just fucking place.</v>

2999
02:09:05.870 --> 02:09:10.870
<v Speaker 2>They were bred for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's championship bloodline's like </v>

3000
02:09:10.870 --> 02:09:10.910
<v Speaker 2>there's a reason why these things do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does this say?</v>

3001
02:09:10.970 --> 02:09:13.850
<v Speaker 2>If that's what Jesus did and I would say</v>
<v Speaker 2>let them do it,</v>

3002
02:09:13.851 --> 02:09:18.080
<v Speaker 2>but it's showing us wild chickens in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Walmart in one of these fucking shopping</v>

3003
02:09:18.081 --> 02:09:21.680
<v Speaker 2>cart return bar things and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>covered with chickens.</v>

3004
02:09:21.681 --> 02:09:23.780
<v Speaker 2>This is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why he hadn't quite.</v>

3005
02:09:24.140 --> 02:09:25.310
<v Speaker 2>That's nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3006
02:09:25.640 --> 02:09:28.460
<v Speaker 2>There's wild chickens now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the word on killing those?</v>

3007
02:09:29.240 --> 02:09:30.840
<v Speaker 2>Can you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you want some chicken soup and you'll</v>

3008
02:09:30.870 --> 02:09:35.870
<v Speaker 2>have a lot of money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you allowed to just whack one of </v>

3009
02:09:35.870 --> 02:09:35.870
<v Speaker 2>those?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope so.</v>

3010
02:09:35.870 --> 02:09:35.870
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at all of them.</v>

3011
02:09:35.870 --> 02:09:36.710
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't have any predators.</v>

3012
02:09:36.860 --> 02:09:39.380
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hawaii is a really bananas place when it</v>

3013
02:09:39.381 --> 02:09:40.220
<v Speaker 2>comes to wildlife</v>

3014
02:09:40.430 --> 02:09:44.720
<v Speaker 4>because they used to have these burdens </v>
<v Speaker 4>called noni birds and they were.</v>

3015
02:09:44.780 --> 02:09:49.780
<v Speaker 4>They were so docile people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The native just picked them up and </v>

3016
02:09:49.780 --> 02:09:52.371
<v Speaker 4>crack.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean like Dodo birds are like that </v>

3017
02:09:52.371 --> 02:09:52.371
<v Speaker 4>when exchanges datum extinct because </v>
<v Speaker 4>these birds had no fear.</v>

3018
02:09:52.690 --> 02:09:55.920
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's interesting over there.</v>

3019
02:09:55.950 --> 02:09:56.590
<v Speaker 4>But they didn't bring</v>

3020
02:09:56.690 --> 02:10:01.690
<v Speaker 2>predators for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they have like these wild pigs and </v>

3021
02:10:01.690 --> 02:10:01.690
<v Speaker 2>just running around everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to hunt them down.</v>

3022
02:10:01.690 --> 02:10:03.420
<v Speaker 4>Pigs are very.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because we're on pigs,</v>

3023
02:10:03.421 --> 02:10:05.770
<v Speaker 4>like in South America,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was not,</v>

3024
02:10:05.800 --> 02:10:10.800
<v Speaker 4>not just disease,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the case was brought pigs that </v>

3025
02:10:10.800 --> 02:10:11.810
<v Speaker 4>fucked up the crops.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The native fucks.</v>

3026
02:10:11.830 --> 02:10:13.130
<v Speaker 4>Everything up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pigs turn.</v>

3027
02:10:13.540 --> 02:10:15.040
<v Speaker 4>You must watch all that pig shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3028
02:10:15.041 --> 02:10:19.900
<v Speaker 4>They turned wild and get tusks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Inheriting what Jamie pulled up here,</v>

3029
02:10:20.270 --> 02:10:25.270
<v Speaker 2>last major contributor to the key </v>
<v Speaker 2>chicken population is always a shocker </v>

3030
02:10:25.270 --> 02:10:25.700
<v Speaker 2>even to people who have lived here all </v>
<v Speaker 2>their lives.</v>

3031
02:10:26.010 --> 02:10:29.990
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] wild jungle fowl is </v>
<v Speaker 2>protected under state law.</v>

3032
02:10:29.991 --> 02:10:34.991
<v Speaker 2>Like all birds of Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Moa is protected as an important of </v>

3033
02:10:34.991 --> 02:10:34.991
<v Speaker 2>nature.</v>

3034
02:10:34.991 --> 02:10:39.790
<v Speaker 3>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a terrible idea because that </v>

3035
02:10:39.790 --> 02:10:39.790
<v Speaker 3>means nothing's going to eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if nothing's going to eat them,</v>

3036
02:10:39.790 --> 02:10:42.220
<v Speaker 3>they don't have any predators.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That means to get disease.</v>

3037
02:10:42.950 --> 02:10:43.760
<v Speaker 3>Not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3038
02:10:43.770 --> 02:10:46.310
<v Speaker 3>you can have abortions up until 40 weeks</v>
<v Speaker 3>out there too,</v>

3039
02:10:46.311 --> 02:10:49.520
<v Speaker 3>but you can't touch the chickens if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have food for them.</v>

3040
02:10:49.550 --> 02:10:54.550
<v Speaker 3>They're just going to keep breeding the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The real question is do you have food </v>

3041
02:10:54.550 --> 02:10:54.620
<v Speaker 3>for them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because if there's just a law of nature,</v>

3042
02:10:54.640 --> 02:10:59.640
<v Speaker 3>if there's no predators,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their population is going to match the </v>

3043
02:10:59.640 --> 02:10:59.640
<v Speaker 3>food supply.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

3044
02:10:59.640 --> 02:11:04.140
<v Speaker 3>Was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you go secret beach that no one's </v>

3045
02:11:04.140 --> 02:11:04.140
<v Speaker 3>supposed to know about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's on every map.</v>

3046
02:11:04.140 --> 02:11:05.450
<v Speaker 3>Not even gas stations do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3047
02:11:05.451 --> 02:11:06.320
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which ones?</v>

3048
02:11:06.380 --> 02:11:07.640
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never been to Hawaii.</v>

3049
02:11:07.700 --> 02:11:09.250
<v Speaker 3>I've been to a waa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Waa.</v>

3050
02:11:09.260 --> 02:11:11.660
<v Speaker 3>Who is Hawaii?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hawaii.</v>

3051
02:11:11.920 --> 02:11:15.910
<v Speaker 3>Hawaii is where Lulu I went and did that</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Nepali coast tour that,</v>

3052
02:11:16.110 --> 02:11:18.230
<v Speaker 3>that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Marin told me that it,</v>

3053
02:11:18.231 --> 02:11:19.190
<v Speaker 3>but he took a helicopter.</v>

3054
02:11:19.190 --> 02:11:21.590
<v Speaker 3>But I stand up in Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3055
02:11:21.650 --> 02:11:25.960
<v Speaker 3>my cousin got married.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She looks impossible to deny.</v>

3056
02:11:26.900 --> 02:11:29.030
<v Speaker 3>It's really like a rich kid that like </v>
<v Speaker 3>drops out.</v>

3057
02:11:29.031 --> 02:11:30.260
<v Speaker 3>You threw it in Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3058
02:11:30.650 --> 02:11:35.650
<v Speaker 3>let's see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're from here and you're some rich </v>

3059
02:11:35.650 --> 02:11:35.650
<v Speaker 3>kid or like sort of Williamsburg or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

3060
02:11:35.650 --> 02:11:35.990
<v Speaker 3>That's Hawaii because you got to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>rich.</v>

3061
02:11:36.150 --> 02:11:37.580
<v Speaker 3>The houses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess,</v>

3062
02:11:37.770 --> 02:11:39.470
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's expensive because the upkeep,</v>

3063
02:11:39.471 --> 02:11:41.840
<v Speaker 3>because the houses degrades.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The white people live in.</v>

3064
02:11:41.841 --> 02:11:43.580
<v Speaker 3>There are a lot of cultural </v>

<v Speaker 3>It was too humid.</v>

3106
02:13:14.270 --> 02:13:16.610

02:13:25.140 --> 02:13:26.520
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3111
02:13:26.521 --> 02:13:28.340
<v Speaker 3>you got to moisturize moisture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

3113
02:13:31.240 --> 02:13:34.980
<v Speaker 3>It seemed different to like less house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like where I live is so dry.</v>

3114

3117
02:13:43.590 --> 02:13:46.530
<v Speaker 3>We flew five hours across the ocean to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get here.</v>

3118
02:13:46.770 --> 02:13:48.090
<v Speaker 3>This is America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3119
02:13:50.930 --> 02:13:52.710
<v Speaker 3>I think if you just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I had lived there,</v>

3120
02:13:52.860 --> 02:13:57.860
<v Speaker 3>it would eventually become a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>beautiful hell am I only joy would be </v>

<v Speaker 3>meth.</v>

3122
02:13:59.280 --> 02:14:04.280
<v Speaker 3>What if.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which would if somebody offered you a </v>

3123
02:14:04.280 --> 02:14:07.500
<v Speaker 3>residency at the four seasons in Maui </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was serious cash,</v>

3124
02:14:07.530 --> 02:14:12.530
<v Speaker 3>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kurt Metzger doing standup every </v>

02:14:12.530 --> 02:14:12.530
<v Speaker 3>weekend?</v>
<v Speaker 3>People come down there.</v>

3127
02:14:13.081 --> 02:14:13.800

3131
02:14:22.440 --> 02:14:24.660

<v Speaker 3>at snl.</v>

3132
02:14:27.570 --> 02:14:29.820
<v Speaker 3>Comedy's tough in Hawaii though because </v>

<v Speaker 2>like some of the most ridiculous things </v>

3280
02:21:22.971 --> 02:21:24.660

<v Speaker 4>It was a power grab.</v>

3286
02:21:30.450 --> 02:21:33.490
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's in the eyes of Tammy Faye.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That documentary because they were,</v>

3287

<v Speaker 2>people to say like,</v>

3293
02:21:48.201 --> 02:21:49.730
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Farah Khan does it.</v>

3294
02:21:50.140 --> 02:21:54.290
<v Speaker 2>Where is that going to America?</v>
<v Speaker 2>America sucks.</v>

<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>

3298
02:22:03.480 --> 02:22:07.010
<v Speaker 2>Why does saying Boston?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Italian,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I think he might homeboy my test,</v>

3301
02:22:17.360 --> 02:22:21.230
<v Speaker 2>but he puts together these ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 2>edits of the Jim Baker show.</v>

3302
02:22:21.770 --> 02:22:22.950
<v Speaker 2>Preparedness and survival.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The.</v>

3309
02:22:37.171 --> 02:22:42.171
<v Speaker 3>And then I dated a girl who spoke Hebrew</v>
<v Speaker 3>and didn't understand how off all my </v>

3310
02:22:42.171 --> 02:22:43.330
<v Speaker 3>pronunciations were of everything.</v>

<v Speaker 3>So you're was.</v>

3312
02:22:45.210 --> 02:22:47.190
<v Speaker 3>Yours was straight from the Jehovah's </v>
<v Speaker 3>Witnesses.</v>

3313
02:22:47.600 --> 02:22:50.310
<v Speaker 3>I had a my book of Bible stories where </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys reading the tape,</v>

3314
02:22:50.311 --> 02:22:53.430
<v Speaker 3>so I pronounce these words.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just how Americans pronounce,</v>

3315
02:22:53.830 --> 02:22:54.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bible words.</v>

3316
02:22:55.410 --> 02:23:00.410
<v Speaker 3>The Shit's not free for us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's for the people that likes to say </v>

3317
02:23:00.410 --> 02:23:00.410
<v Speaker 3>who pronounces it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3318
02:23:00.410 --> 02:23:03.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a lot of these words.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3319
02:23:03.060 --> 02:23:05.790
<v Speaker 3>Hebrew though that they recreated it </v>
<v Speaker 3>when the nation.</v>

3320
02:23:05.791 --> 02:23:07.930
<v Speaker 3>Israel is kind of interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had to re re.</v>

3321
02:23:08.010 --> 02:23:10.500
<v Speaker 3>It was like a lost language that had to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be rebuilt.</v>

3322
02:23:11.220 --> 02:23:14.890
<v Speaker 3>Rebuilt it from the ground up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3323
02:23:14.891 --> 02:23:16.430
<v Speaker 3>I guess not from the ground up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3324
02:23:16.590 --> 02:23:21.590
<v Speaker 3>They had to put it there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it now it's a fluently spoken </v>

3325
02:23:21.590 --> 02:23:21.880
<v Speaker 3>language and it was like dead for </v>
<v Speaker 3>awhile.</v>

3326
02:23:22.290 --> 02:23:23.580
<v Speaker 3>There's two different Hebrews,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3327
02:23:23.581 --> 02:23:24.960
<v Speaker 3>There's ancient Hebrew.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's different,</v>

3328
02:23:25.080 --> 02:23:26.190
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess.</v>

3329
02:23:26.191 --> 02:23:28.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ancient Hebrew with the letters are also</v>

3330
02:23:28.411 --> 02:23:31.260
<v Speaker 3>a numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Numbers in ancient Hebrew were weird.</v>

3331
02:23:31.420 --> 02:23:33.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they use it anymore,</v>

3332
02:23:33.360 --> 02:23:38.360
<v Speaker 3>but that's like the original Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean like how many people use ancient </v>

3333
02:23:38.360 --> 02:23:40.570
<v Speaker 3>Hebrew teak cv can find a video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What ancient Hebrew sounds like?</v>

3334
02:23:40.620 --> 02:23:42.690
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my ex's parents are Hebrew scholars,</v>

3335
02:23:42.691 --> 02:23:46.110
<v Speaker 3>so they went to that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to hear what it sounds like.</v>

3336
02:23:46.290 --> 02:23:48.000
<v Speaker 3>Like keep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sounds like phlegm noises.</v>

3337
02:23:48.001 --> 02:23:51.240
<v Speaker 3>It all sounds like a weird fucking sad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's an example of that,</v>

3338
02:23:51.241 --> 02:23:53.710
<v Speaker 3>about that sound.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a,</v>

3339
02:23:53.850 --> 02:23:56.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean think about it like Chinese.</v>

3340
02:23:56.340 --> 02:23:57.860
<v Speaker 3>It's a very specific sound.</v>
<v Speaker 3>German,</v>

3341
02:23:58.790 --> 02:24:00.170
<v Speaker 3>Italian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you been to China?</v>

3342
02:24:00.810 --> 02:24:02.280
<v Speaker 3>I've never been to China,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Japan though.</v>

3343
02:24:02.310 --> 02:24:04.800
<v Speaker 3>It's worth going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot like she sounds.</v>

3344
02:24:04.860 --> 02:24:07.000
<v Speaker 3>Let me hear that Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Me,</v>

3345
02:24:07.120 --> 02:24:08.990
<v Speaker 3>aerosmith,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Macbeth.</v>

3346
02:24:09.130 --> 02:24:14.130
<v Speaker 3>I will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That sounds like a little heme.</v>

3347
02:24:15.430 --> 02:24:20.430
<v Speaker 3>Like wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Little crazy.</v>

3348
02:24:21.631 --> 02:24:26.520
<v Speaker 3>It looks like Lord of the Rings Elf.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Elf language doesn't.</v>

3349
02:24:27.690 --> 02:24:31.800
<v Speaker 3>Ancient languages like Sanskrit looks so</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>

3350
02:24:32.090 --> 02:24:34.140
<v Speaker 3>Know like if this was like on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>spaceship,</v>

3351
02:24:34.380 --> 02:24:36.090
<v Speaker 3>you would think would like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at that.</v>

3352
02:24:36.091 --> 02:24:38.960
<v Speaker 3>If that was on a spaceship etched into </v>
<v Speaker 3>the side of the spaceship,</v>

3353
02:24:38.970 --> 02:24:39.930
<v Speaker 3>you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

3354
02:24:39.931 --> 02:24:41.720
<v Speaker 3>It's a fucking alien language.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3355
02:24:41.920 --> 02:24:43.560
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what any of those things </v>
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>

3356
02:24:43.680 --> 02:24:45.600
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what one of those numbers </v>
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

3357
02:24:45.601 --> 02:24:47.490
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the fuck those words </v>
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>

3358
02:24:47.491 --> 02:24:49.800
<v Speaker 3>Those letters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's an alien language.</v>

3359
02:24:49.801 --> 02:24:54.801
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me almost more alien than a lot of </v>

3360
02:24:54.801 --> 02:24:54.801
<v Speaker 3>Asian languages.</v>

3361
02:24:54.801 --> 02:24:56.380
<v Speaker 3>That looks crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3362
02:24:56.390 --> 02:25:01.390
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a reason to kind of doubt that </v>

3363
02:25:01.390 --> 02:25:01.390
<v Speaker 3>somebody translating it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3364
02:25:01.390 --> 02:25:02.430
<v Speaker 3>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3365
02:25:02.431 --> 02:25:04.600
<v Speaker 3>you looked at that jibberish and you saw</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3366
02:25:04.650 --> 02:25:05.790
<v Speaker 3>scholars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3367
02:25:05.791 --> 02:25:08.190
<v Speaker 3>the whole thing with that is that these </v>
<v Speaker 3>ancient,</v>

3368
02:25:08.191 --> 02:25:09.380
<v Speaker 3>ancient,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ancient languages,</v>

3369
02:25:09.390 --> 02:25:12.750
<v Speaker 3>like all these stories came from these </v>
<v Speaker 3>ancient languages.</v>

3370
02:25:12.751 --> 02:25:13.620
<v Speaker 3>Like if you go way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>

3371
02:25:13.621 --> 02:25:14.630
<v Speaker 3>way back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>

3372
02:25:14.700 --> 02:25:17.130
<v Speaker 3>So Mer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the epic of Gilgamesh.</v>

3373
02:25:17.131 --> 02:25:19.380
<v Speaker 3>There's all these Noah's Ark </v>
<v Speaker 3>similarities.</v>

3374
02:25:20.160 --> 02:25:22.600
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of stuff and all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>ancient stories,</v>

3375
02:25:22.601 --> 02:25:26.710
<v Speaker 3>that's all probably points to some real </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit that happened for sure.</v>

3376
02:25:26.711 --> 02:25:29.170
<v Speaker 3>It along the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like what you're talking about with</v>

3377
02:25:29.230 --> 02:25:32.740
<v Speaker 3>social justice warriors and how they </v>
<v Speaker 3>behave like it's a religion.</v>

3378
02:25:33.040 --> 02:25:38.040
<v Speaker 3>There's like a natural compulsion for </v>
<v Speaker 3>people to be on a group and have that </v>

3379
02:25:38.040 --> 02:25:42.871
<v Speaker 3>group have a very clear ideology the way</v>
<v Speaker 3>up to atheism if they want it because </v>

3380
02:25:42.871 --> 02:25:43.090
<v Speaker 3>that's like almost a luxury I think.</v>

3381
02:25:43.150 --> 02:25:44.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you're right.</v>

3382
02:25:44.290 --> 02:25:47.070
<v Speaker 3>And I don't know how to just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3383
02:25:47.540 --> 02:25:50.050
<v Speaker 3>about thinking what I will say the DMT </v>
<v Speaker 3>shape.</v>

3384
02:25:50.600 --> 02:25:53.300
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did get like more of a,</v>

3385
02:25:53.600 --> 02:25:55.000
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's more than,</v>

3386
02:25:55.350 --> 02:26:00.350
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something else there and it's </v>

3387
02:26:00.350 --> 02:26:01.810
<v Speaker 3>crazy because when know I read about </v>
<v Speaker 3>that shit in high school.</v>

3388
02:26:01.811 --> 02:26:04.900
<v Speaker 3>I read some more about that guy that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is the big DMT guy.</v>

3389
02:26:05.050 --> 02:26:06.520
<v Speaker 3>Terence Mckenna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3390
02:26:06.521 --> 02:26:08.650
<v Speaker 3>because I think he projects a lot of his</v>
<v Speaker 3>own horseshit into it,</v>

3391
02:26:08.651 --> 02:26:12.270
<v Speaker 3>but that stuff that Karen does or the </v>
<v Speaker 3>agenda,</v>

3392
02:26:12.360 --> 02:26:16.450
<v Speaker 3>just let me tell you when I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never felt a thing that felt so much,</v>

3393
02:26:16.451 --> 02:26:21.451
<v Speaker 3>like not making me hallucinate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like he was taking away a </v>

3394
02:26:21.451 --> 02:26:24.271
<v Speaker 3>hallucination and that is such,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something so terrifying about </v>

3395
02:26:24.271 --> 02:26:24.271
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it also like,</v>

3396
02:26:24.271 --> 02:26:24.560
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's great.</v>

3397
02:26:24.590 --> 02:26:29.350
<v Speaker 3>Like you just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you feel like there has to be just based</v>

3398
02:26:29.351 --> 02:26:31.030
<v Speaker 3>on the shit you would say.</v>

3399
02:26:31.090 --> 02:26:32.380
<v Speaker 3>Even if it's just shaking your head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

3400
02:26:32.381 --> 02:26:36.070
<v Speaker 3>why would that even be in my head?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's entirely possible that whatever the</v>

3401
02:26:36.071 --> 02:26:40.120
<v Speaker 3>fuck consciousness is can pass from this</v>
<v Speaker 3>stage into another stage.</v>

3402
02:26:40.480 --> 02:26:45.480
<v Speaker 3>And the only reason why I would hesitate</v>
<v Speaker 3>to say that's exactly what happens is </v>

3403
02:26:45.480 --> 02:26:46.090
<v Speaker 3>because there's no proof one way or </v>
<v Speaker 3>another,</v>

3404
02:26:46.420 --> 02:26:49.150
<v Speaker 3>but it's the pineal gland.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit is not proven.</v>

3405
02:26:49.151 --> 02:26:54.151
<v Speaker 3>They don't know that dmt comes the </v>
<v Speaker 3>cottonwood research foundation.</v>

3406
02:26:56.230 --> 02:27:01.230
<v Speaker 3>They did a series of tests with rats and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they proved that live rats have a dmt </v>

3407
02:27:01.541 --> 02:27:06.541
<v Speaker 3>produced by the pineal gland.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't necessarily mean that humans </v>

3408
02:27:06.541 --> 02:27:06.541
<v Speaker 3>do too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're pretty sure they did.</v>

3409
02:27:06.541 --> 02:27:11.401
<v Speaker 3>You like to know that your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your lungs producer and your liver </v>

3410
02:27:11.401 --> 02:27:11.401
<v Speaker 3>produces it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a fact.</v>

3411
02:27:11.401 --> 02:27:16.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So your body's producing dmt 100 </v>

3412
02:27:16.050 --> 02:27:16.050
<v Speaker 3>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you know that?</v>

3413
02:27:16.050 --> 02:27:16.050
<v Speaker 3>Or did you like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3414
02:27:16.050 --> 02:27:18.490
<v Speaker 3>like those hp lovecraft kind of horror </v>
<v Speaker 3>stories.</v>

3415
02:27:18.550 --> 02:27:23.550
<v Speaker 3>I love those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's a movie made out of one of </v>

3416
02:27:23.550 --> 02:27:23.550
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all about his pineal gland.</v>

3417
02:27:23.550 --> 02:27:23.890
<v Speaker 3>He's taking something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mixes pineal gland swelling up.</v>

3418
02:27:23.891 --> 02:27:25.680
<v Speaker 3>Which one is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Movies on stars.</v>

3419
02:27:25.690 --> 02:27:28.150
<v Speaker 3>The guy from reanimator.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>

3420
02:27:28.320 --> 02:27:33.320
<v Speaker 3>it's not reanimator I'm feeling it now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kind of remember what you're talking </v>

3421
02:27:33.910 --> 02:27:34.890
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you that creepy.</v>

3422
02:27:34.940 --> 02:27:38.440
<v Speaker 3>The DNP has a creepy creepy because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was totally worth doing.</v>

3423
02:27:38.950 --> 02:27:40.660
<v Speaker 3>But the thing that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3424
02:27:40.661 --> 02:27:42.850
<v Speaker 3>whatever people say they meet entities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3425
02:27:42.851 --> 02:27:45.040
<v Speaker 3>But I don't know if that shit is meeting</v>
<v Speaker 3>entity,</v>

3426
02:27:45.070 --> 02:27:47.410
<v Speaker 3>but I'll tell you the thing that just </v>
<v Speaker 3>sticks with me that I'm like,</v>

3427
02:27:47.770 --> 02:27:50.440
<v Speaker 3>how in the fuck is that possible is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>shapes that you,</v>

3428
02:27:50.580 --> 02:27:55.580
<v Speaker 3>that I could say I was well aware that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were a bit more than three </v>

3429
02:27:55.580 --> 02:27:59.971
<v Speaker 3>dimensional shapes and it's so crazy to </v>
<v Speaker 3>look at that and perceive it.</v>

3430
02:28:00.600 --> 02:28:05.600
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how on earth could I perceive this </v>

3431
02:28:05.600 --> 02:28:05.600
<v Speaker 3>shape?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when I came and you can't break,</v>

3432
02:28:05.600 --> 02:28:05.970
<v Speaker 3>come back with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3433
02:28:06.170 --> 02:28:07.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see it though.</v>

3434
02:28:07.451 --> 02:28:12.451
<v Speaker 3>And someone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have you ever seen Alex grades aren't </v>

3435

<v Speaker 3>awesome?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

3436
02:28:12.451 --> 02:28:14.050
<v Speaker 3>You haven't seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pull up Alex Gray.</v>

3437
02:28:14.051 --> 02:28:19.051
<v Speaker 3>He's a psychedelic artists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean all of this stuff is basically </v>

3438
02:28:19.051 --> 02:28:20.890
<v Speaker 3>just to mean based art because </v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes.</v>

3439
02:28:20.900 --> 02:28:21.470
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3440
02:28:21.471 --> 02:28:21.800
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3441
02:28:21.801 --> 02:28:21.980
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

3442
02:28:21.980 --> 02:28:24.430
<v Speaker 1>He's brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His stuff's something.</v>

3443
02:28:24.460 --> 02:28:28.730
<v Speaker 1>If it's fucking amazing for two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of them,</v>

3444
02:28:28.731 --> 02:28:29.150
<v Speaker 1>but let.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3445
02:28:29.151 --> 02:28:32.060
<v Speaker 1>he draws a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the covers for tool albums.</v>

3446
02:28:32.180 --> 02:28:36.630
<v Speaker 1>There's a ton of like that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That one specific DMT DMT.</v>

3447
02:28:36.700 --> 02:28:39.110
<v Speaker 1>That is dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is hardcore dmt.</v>

3448
02:28:39.111 --> 02:28:41.000
<v Speaker 1>Hardcore dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you do Dmt,</v>

3449
02:28:41.001 --> 02:28:46.001
<v Speaker 1>you see that and you see that in a way </v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's so much more spectacular than</v>

3450
02:28:46.371 --> 02:28:47.990
<v Speaker 1>any.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything you ever seen.</v>

3451
02:28:48.410 --> 02:28:50.810
<v Speaker 1>Normal consciousness is your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

3452
02:28:50.811 --> 02:28:53.830
<v Speaker 1>are you saying you're not thinking of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your.</v>

3453
02:28:54.540 --> 02:28:56.530
<v Speaker 1>You're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You look around you.</v>

3454
02:28:56.540 --> 02:28:58.340
<v Speaker 1>You're stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're opening your eyes.</v>

3455
02:28:58.520 --> 02:28:59.860
<v Speaker 1>Here's what's crazy because you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort.</v>

3456
02:28:59.870 --> 02:29:04.870
<v Speaker 1>If you close your eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like they're open somewhere else </v>

3457
02:29:04.870 --> 02:29:07.210
<v Speaker 1>and then you open your eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see reality overlaid over to tell me</v>

3458
02:29:07.211 --> 02:29:10.130
<v Speaker 1>this can influence the Egyptians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Click on the one your cursors on.</v>

3459
02:29:10.980 --> 02:29:12.710
<v Speaker 1>Tell me that didn't influence the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Egyptians.</v>

3460
02:29:12.810 --> 02:29:14.050
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This painting or this,</v>

3461
02:29:14.310 --> 02:29:15.460
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these kind of trips.</v>

3462
02:29:16.440 --> 02:29:17.980
<v Speaker 1>Images.</v>
<v Speaker 1>DMT.</v>

3463
02:29:18.020 --> 02:29:18.890
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3464
02:29:18.891 --> 02:29:20.690
<v Speaker 1>There was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that John Anthony West</v>

3465
02:29:20.691 --> 02:29:25.691
<v Speaker 1>did was he was going over that temple in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the temple and man is one of the </v>

3466
02:29:26.031 --> 02:29:26.510
<v Speaker 1>structures.</v>

3467
02:29:26.580 --> 02:29:30.070
<v Speaker 2>It's in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Egypt and it,</v>

3468
02:29:30.090 --> 02:29:35.090
<v Speaker 2>it shows different parts of it are </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to represent different </v>

3469
02:29:35.090 --> 02:29:38.630
<v Speaker 2>corridors of the body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like different Chakras of the body and </v>

3470
02:29:38.630 --> 02:29:42.171
<v Speaker 2>that there was some evidence that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>eye of horus is really the pineal gland </v>

3471
02:29:43.230 --> 02:29:45.180
<v Speaker 2>and that's what that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That symbol is like.</v>

3472
02:29:45.181 --> 02:29:49.470
<v Speaker 2>See if Google,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a pineal gland,</v>

3473
02:29:49.860 --> 02:29:52.970
<v Speaker 2>eye of Horus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they think that they're.</v>

3474
02:29:52.971 --> 02:29:55.440
<v Speaker 2>They're so similar in the way they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>shaped.</v>

3475
02:29:55.650 --> 02:29:58.860
<v Speaker 2>It's entirely possible that that's what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a very alternative thing,</v>

3476
02:29:58.980 --> 02:30:01.230
<v Speaker 2>but look how it looks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the thing looks on the right,</v>

3477
02:30:01.231 --> 02:30:03.600
<v Speaker 2>the actual pineal gland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and look at the eye and the left.</v>

3478
02:30:03.970 --> 02:30:05.070
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3479
02:30:05.190 --> 02:30:09.240
<v Speaker 2>see that wing off the side and the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>it drops down right from the eyeball.</v>

3480
02:30:09.540 --> 02:30:10.980
<v Speaker 2>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fucking similar.</v>

3481
02:30:11.880 --> 02:30:16.880
<v Speaker 2>It's entirely possible that they figured</v>
<v Speaker 2>that out somewhere along the line that </v>

3482
02:30:16.880 --> 02:30:20.970
<v Speaker 2>through yoga breathing methods or some </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of psychedelic drugs,</v>

3483
02:30:20.971 --> 02:30:25.971
<v Speaker 2>they found that they were achieving a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hallucinogenic state and they were able </v>

3484
02:30:25.971 --> 02:30:29.421
<v Speaker 2>to somehow or another isolate where that</v>
<v Speaker 2>state is being initiated and if it's </v>

3485
02:30:30.211 --> 02:30:32.640
<v Speaker 2>being initiated in dodgy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>honestly by your body,</v>

3486
02:30:32.641 --> 02:30:37.641
<v Speaker 2>like through psychedelic breathing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's probably where it's being </v>

3487
02:30:37.641 --> 02:30:37.641
<v Speaker 2>produced.</v>

3488
02:30:37.641 --> 02:30:41.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to sound like Schumer </v>

3489
02:30:41.930 --> 02:30:41.930
<v Speaker 1>defender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that look,</v>

3490
02:30:41.930 --> 02:30:44.730
<v Speaker 1>coincidentally parallel thought certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns over and over again that,</v>

3491
02:30:46.531 --> 02:30:48.600
<v Speaker 1>but that pattern is pretty fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>close.</v>

3492
02:30:48.601 --> 02:30:50.550
<v Speaker 1>You might be right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be coincidental,</v>

3493
02:30:50.700 --> 02:30:53.400
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that it dropped a straight </v>
<v Speaker 1>line drops down right before the.</v>

3494
02:30:53.440 --> 02:30:56.100
<v Speaker 1>I showed again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>straight line drops down right below the</v>

3495
02:30:56.101 --> 02:30:59.220
<v Speaker 1>eye and the left Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing they did.</v>

3496
02:30:59.310 --> 02:31:02.420
<v Speaker 1>They did surgery on people in Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3497
02:31:02.970 --> 02:31:07.970
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought Egypt thought the mind was in </v>

3498
02:31:07.970 --> 02:31:08.580
<v Speaker 1>the heart and that's why they pulled the</v>
<v Speaker 1>useless brain out through the nose.</v>

3499
02:31:08.581 --> 02:31:12.330
<v Speaker 1>When they mummified you like you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>telling me what their intent.</v>

3500
02:31:12.510 --> 02:31:15.030
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like embalming techniques we have,</v>

3501
02:31:15.040 --> 02:31:17.310
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean that in respect to</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain kept.</v>

3502
02:31:17.610 --> 02:31:19.050
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't look well.</v>

3503
02:31:19.060 --> 02:31:20.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't</v>

3504
02:31:20.100 --> 02:31:25.100
<v Speaker 2>know everything about the human body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way they attach significance to </v>

3505
02:31:25.100 --> 02:31:29.121
<v Speaker 2>something in the brain if they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>think that's what I think through </v>

3506
02:31:29.121 --> 02:31:29.121
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think when they were doing these heavy</v>

3507
02:31:29.121 --> 02:31:30.420
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which by the way,</v>

3508
02:31:30.421 --> 02:31:34.200
<v Speaker 2>we're absolutely being used by them by </v>
<v Speaker 2>tons and tons.</v>

3509
02:31:34.201 --> 02:31:39.201
<v Speaker 2>I could listen to the dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the thing that really blew my </v>

3510
02:31:39.201 --> 02:31:40.680
<v Speaker 2>mind because I was looking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to even believe rumors.</v>

3511
02:31:40.681 --> 02:31:41.670
<v Speaker 2>That's what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

3512
02:31:42.070 --> 02:31:42.940
<v Speaker 2>I saw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I looked.</v>

3513
02:31:42.990 --> 02:31:44.790
<v Speaker 2>You ever look at somebody while you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>on trip?</v>

3514
02:31:45.520 --> 02:31:47.310
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always kept my eyes closed.</v>

3515
02:31:47.970 --> 02:31:52.970
<v Speaker 2>I closed my eyes and one time I opened </v>
<v Speaker 2>my eyes and look at somebody and they </v>

3516
02:31:52.970 --> 02:31:53.820
<v Speaker 2>had six arms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a Hindu.</v>

3517
02:31:54.130 --> 02:31:59.130
<v Speaker 2>Somebody was just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might have been telling you this at </v>

3518
02:31:59.130 --> 02:32:01.731
<v Speaker 2>the economy store told me at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>perception gets broken down and that's </v>

3519
02:32:02.131 --> 02:32:02.940
<v Speaker 2>the craziness.</v>

3520
02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:06.660
<v Speaker 2>And so then motion looks like sick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Shiva.</v>

3521
02:32:06.970 --> 02:32:08.370
<v Speaker 2>It looked like a Hindu thing and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3522
02:32:08.371 --> 02:32:13.371
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I imagine beyond that stuff and you see </v>

3523
02:32:13.371 --> 02:32:13.371
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3524
02:32:13.371 --> 02:32:13.371
<v Speaker 2>it looked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looked to me so much,</v>

3525
02:32:13.371 --> 02:32:17.280
<v Speaker 2>like a vision from the intake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those six rm Kinda got collect that kind</v>

3526
02:32:17.281 --> 02:32:19.110
<v Speaker 2>of art like Buddhists and shit like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

3527
02:32:19.111 --> 02:32:22.080
<v Speaker 2>Like this kind of shit because I saw </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

3528
02:32:22.320 --> 02:32:25.020
<v Speaker 2>I saw this image,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this exact image.</v>

3529
02:32:25.021 --> 02:32:27.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean this has a third eye and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

3530
02:32:27.780 --> 02:32:30.630
<v Speaker 2>The sculptor made this for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember his name.</v>

3531
02:32:30.631 --> 02:32:31.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish I could remember right now,</v>

3532
02:32:31.981 --> 02:32:33.010
<v Speaker 2>but I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3533
02:32:33.390 --> 02:32:38.390
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sculptor made that for me based on this </v>

3534
02:32:38.390 --> 02:32:40.620
<v Speaker 2>vision that I had high on dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw an infinite number of those really</v>

3535
02:32:40.621 --> 02:32:44.760
<v Speaker 2>saw one hovering here and then in every </v>
<v Speaker 2>direction out from him.</v>

3536
02:32:44.761 --> 02:32:48.270
<v Speaker 2>There was an infinite number of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they were all hovering and vibrating</v>

3537
02:32:48.271 --> 02:32:49.800
<v Speaker 2>around me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's like a fractal.</v>

3538
02:32:49.950 --> 02:32:52.680
<v Speaker 2>Is there like fractals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>100 percent fact geometric?</v>

3539
02:32:53.010 --> 02:32:55.980
<v Speaker 2>What do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think having done it?</v>

3540
02:32:55.981 --> 02:32:57.150
<v Speaker 2>Like what do you think like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3541
02:32:58.290 --> 02:33:00.610
<v Speaker 2>what do you think now with the empty </v>
<v Speaker 2>after la?</v>

3542
02:33:00.720 --> 02:33:01.260
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3543
02:33:01.261 --> 02:33:03.360
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I saw just a couple things,</v>

3544
02:33:03.361 --> 02:33:06.210
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know how long ago they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about it with people,</v>

3545
02:33:06.211 --> 02:33:09.200
<v Speaker 2>but you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's your opinion of it now as like a,</v>

3546
02:33:09.360 --> 02:33:10.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're seeing?</v>

3547
02:33:10.530 --> 02:33:12.270
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could be anything.</v>

3548
02:33:12.810 --> 02:33:17.810
<v Speaker 2>It definitely could be some sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an insane hijacking of your sensory </v>

3549
02:33:17.810 --> 02:33:22.641
<v Speaker 2>nervous system produces this spectacular</v>
<v Speaker 2>psych duck effect that's so profound.</v>

3550
02:33:22.981 --> 02:33:27.981
<v Speaker 2>The solution to Jane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a hallucinogenic effect that's so </v>

3551
02:33:27.981 --> 02:33:29.130
<v Speaker 2>profound that it literally is like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>transcendent experience and changes your</v>

3552
02:33:29.131 --> 02:33:30.780
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's totally popped out to me.</v>

3553
02:33:30.840 --> 02:33:32.700
<v Speaker 2>It's totally possible that it's just a </v>
<v Speaker 2>chemical thing.</v>

3554
02:33:33.180 --> 02:33:35.760
<v Speaker 2>What's also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's also a salsa possibles,</v>

3555
02:33:35.761 --> 02:33:40.761
<v Speaker 2>that life itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that whatever the fuck life is and </v>

3556
02:33:40.761 --> 02:33:43.281
<v Speaker 2>especially whatever the fuck intelligent</v>
<v Speaker 2>life is not understood what </v>

3557
02:33:43.281 --> 02:33:46.611
<v Speaker 2>consciousness is not understood and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>this idea that things can only exist in </v>

3558
02:33:46.611 --> 02:33:46.890
<v Speaker 2>this realm.</v>

3559
02:33:47.100 --> 02:33:52.100
<v Speaker 2>That's not proven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also the fact that when those quantum </v>

3560
02:33:52.100 --> 02:33:54.330
<v Speaker 2>physicists guys start breaking down the </v>
<v Speaker 2>nature of reality and they come up with,</v>

3561
02:33:54.390 --> 02:33:56.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how the fuck they do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just talking out my ass,</v>

3562
02:33:56.820 --> 02:33:59.430
<v Speaker 2>but they come up with the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's 11 dimensions.</v>

3563
02:33:59.630 --> 02:34:00.780
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that they literally,</v>

3564
02:34:00.781 --> 02:34:05.781
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is all changing and constantly </v>

3565
02:34:05.781 --> 02:34:05.970
<v Speaker 2>evolving and moving and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly adding to this.</v>

3566
02:34:06.390 --> 02:34:10.200
<v Speaker 2>It is entirely possible that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of other shit that's around us all</v>

3567
02:34:10.201 --> 02:34:15.201
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just not here and we have access </v>

3568
02:34:15.201 --> 02:34:15.740
<v Speaker 2>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you do DMT womp,</v>

3569
02:34:15.840 --> 02:34:17.680
<v Speaker 2>you go into that other place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's entirely</v>

3570
02:34:18.290 --> 02:34:19.600
<v Speaker 1>settling dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

3571
02:34:19.780 --> 02:34:21.970
<v Speaker 1>it's not like you're going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the shit's here.</v>

3572
02:34:22.210 --> 02:34:24.220
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why you as a skeptic,</v>

3573
02:34:24.280 --> 02:34:26.700
<v Speaker 1>it's very important to hear from you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a guy.</v>

3574
02:34:26.701 --> 02:34:28.060
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you what,</v>

3575
02:34:28.061 --> 02:34:29.840
<v Speaker 1>I'll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I drew a shitty diagram of it,</v>

3576
02:34:30.480 --> 02:34:31.810
<v Speaker 1>his wife felt this is what it feels </v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

3577
02:34:31.811 --> 02:34:34.180
<v Speaker 1>If you ever do it like this little </v>
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>

3578
02:34:34.181 --> 02:34:37.420
<v Speaker 1>let's say a little point is you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what I felt like and these these</v>

3579
02:34:37.421 --> 02:34:39.760
<v Speaker 1>lines I drew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like space and you're this little</v>

3580
02:34:39.761 --> 02:34:42.550
<v Speaker 1>point that could stabbed into space time</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all this shit.</v>

3581
02:34:42.870 --> 02:34:44.410
<v Speaker 1>This is all the shit that makes you </v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

3582
02:34:44.411 --> 02:34:49.411
<v Speaker 1>It forms a point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like closing your eyes and looking </v>

3583
02:34:49.411 --> 02:34:50.840
<v Speaker 1>at all of all of this shit is fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>cross section of your being.</v>

3584
02:34:51.010 --> 02:34:54.960
<v Speaker 1>Everything being focused into making.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you could just reverse look at it.</v>

3585
02:34:55.120 --> 02:34:59.410
<v Speaker 1>It feel like it's lessons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always feel like it's lessons.</v>

3586
02:34:59.440 --> 02:35:00.970
<v Speaker 1>I always feel right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's time to go to school,</v>

3587
02:35:00.971 --> 02:35:02.350
<v Speaker 1>sit down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sit down.</v>

3588
02:35:02.500 --> 02:35:04.600
<v Speaker 1>Here's what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one of the last ones,</v>

3589
02:35:04.601 --> 02:35:09.601
<v Speaker 1>more profound ones was a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>gestures that were all giving me the </v>

3590
02:35:09.601 --> 02:35:09.601
<v Speaker 1>finger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

3591
02:35:09.601 --> 02:35:13.681
<v Speaker 1>They were all circling around me like </v>
<v Speaker 1>giving me the finger like who he named </v>

3592
02:35:13.681 --> 02:35:16.581
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twitter is going to teach you about </v>

3593
02:35:16.581 --> 02:35:16.581
<v Speaker 1>twitter.</v>

3594
02:35:17.180 --> 02:35:21.340
<v Speaker 1>If you're tense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>60 residents all negatively gesture.</v>

3595
02:35:21.520 --> 02:35:23.740
<v Speaker 1>Giving you the finger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how do you feel of yourself?</v>

3596
02:35:23.760 --> 02:35:28.410
<v Speaker 1>Are you in constant defensive mode?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when I sort of relaxed myself,</v>

3597
02:35:28.630 --> 02:35:31.060
<v Speaker 1>they they started wagging their finger </v>
<v Speaker 1>back and forth like,</v>

3598
02:35:31.061 --> 02:35:31.980
<v Speaker 1>Yep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

3599
02:35:32.010 --> 02:35:33.390
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>

3600
02:35:33.520 --> 02:35:35.200
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very strange that the,</v>

3601
02:35:35.320 --> 02:35:40.320
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these things that you see but you can't </v>

3602
02:35:40.320 --> 02:35:41.890
<v Speaker 1>define are constantly changing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you try to like say it looked like</v>

3603
02:35:41.891 --> 02:35:46.891
<v Speaker 1>a gesture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it probably did for a few seconds for a </v>

3604
02:35:46.891 --> 02:35:50.620
<v Speaker 1>few seconds that lived like a gesture </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it imploded and became stars </v>

3605
02:35:50.620 --> 02:35:53.880
<v Speaker 1>and then it sucked in and became </v>
<v Speaker 1>geometric patterns and it became neon </v>

3606
02:35:53.880 --> 02:35:57.841
<v Speaker 1>colored worms that we're making love to </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other and a giant infinite bundle </v>

3607
02:35:57.841 --> 02:35:59.650
<v Speaker 1>of yarn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it becomes weirder and weirder shit</v>

3608
02:35:59.651 --> 02:36:01.780
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to remember when you're done.</v>

3609
02:36:01.840 --> 02:36:06.840
<v Speaker 1>It's almost impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even me saying I kind of feel of having </v>

3610
02:36:06.840 --> 02:36:08.020
<v Speaker 1>kind of a fellowship because I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>totally remember what I saw.</v>

3611
02:36:08.020 --> 02:36:11.590
<v Speaker 1>I remember what I remember to write down</v>
<v Speaker 1>or remember what I repeated.</v>

3612
02:36:11.591 --> 02:36:16.591
<v Speaker 1>So I'm like going back on like my </v>
<v Speaker 1>repeated versions of what I saw,</v>

3613
02:36:16.661 --> 02:36:21.661
<v Speaker 1>but I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember like flashes of the intense </v>

3614
02:36:21.661 --> 02:36:22.400
<v Speaker 1>profound nature of the experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their emotions to it.</v>

3615
02:36:22.410 --> 02:36:27.410
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I came out of it the first time </v>

3616
02:36:27.410 --> 02:36:29.760
<v Speaker 1>that this on New Year's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first time I did it and I fucking,</v>

3617
02:36:30.130 --> 02:36:35.130
<v Speaker 1>I guess I was like weeping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I came out of it because you </v>

3618
02:36:35.130 --> 02:36:36.010
<v Speaker 1>just suddenly are awake and I had like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was so out of it,</v>

3619
02:36:36.011 --> 02:36:37.510
<v Speaker 1>it was like not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went,</v>

3620
02:36:37.610 --> 02:36:39.340
<v Speaker 1>I went from weeping like Oh hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's up?</v>

3621
02:36:40.120 --> 02:36:45.120
<v Speaker 1>And it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I had been staring some crazy </v>

3622
02:36:45.120 --> 02:36:45.120
<v Speaker 1>thing that we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look so beautiful to me.</v>

3623
02:36:45.120 --> 02:36:45.350
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was that.</v>

3624
02:36:45.410 --> 02:36:50.410
<v Speaker 1>It was like coming out of a dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess almost that mechanic quote that </v>

3625
02:36:50.410 --> 02:36:51.370
<v Speaker 1>I think what I'd be scared of is </v>
<v Speaker 1>unearned wisdom.</v>

3626
02:36:51.880 --> 02:36:53.140
<v Speaker 1>I think we kind of said something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

3627
02:36:53.410 --> 02:36:55.710
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be wary of unearned wisdom where I don't</v>

3628
02:36:55.711 --> 02:36:58.120
<v Speaker 1>know if I can handle looking at </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that intense.</v>

3629
02:36:58.420 --> 02:37:01.930
<v Speaker 1>I was really a low feeling state when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>did it and I didn't give a fuck.</v>

3630
02:37:01.931 --> 02:37:05.050
<v Speaker 1>So I wanted to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You pick up the slack,</v>

3631
02:37:05.830 --> 02:37:07.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that unearned wisdom thing.</v>

3632
02:37:07.541 --> 02:37:10.630
<v Speaker 1>I think I know what he's saying and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think there's a real problem with people</v>

3633
02:37:11.140 --> 02:37:15.770
<v Speaker 1>acting profound when they just learned </v>
<v Speaker 1>something an hour ago saying I'm not a</v>

3634
02:37:18.110 --> 02:37:22.370
<v Speaker 2>qualified Sharman is a thing that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>enjoy doing and it's like,</v>

3635
02:37:23.390 --> 02:37:28.390
<v Speaker 2>like jizzing out their knowledge and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of that is on her knowledge.</v>

3636
02:37:29.280 --> 02:37:33.260
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a lot of people that don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>really have a full and including me,</v>

3637
02:37:33.310 --> 02:37:38.310
<v Speaker 2>I've done it many times are so full of </v>
<v Speaker 2>not having a full understanding of the </v>

3638
02:37:38.310 --> 02:37:40.160
<v Speaker 2>topic at hand life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus judges it out.</v>

3639
02:37:41.690 --> 02:37:46.690
<v Speaker 2>But you look for sure you learned a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>about yourself when you do those </v>

3640
02:37:46.690 --> 02:37:46.690
<v Speaker 2>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I learned a lot about myself,</v>

3641
02:37:46.850 --> 02:37:49.490
<v Speaker 2>learned a lot about how I interact with </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

3642
02:37:49.760 --> 02:37:54.760
<v Speaker 2>I saw negative thoughts like expressed </v>
<v Speaker 2>as like this dark green and black </v>

3643
02:37:55.160 --> 02:37:59.540
<v Speaker 2>twisted sort of pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when my thoughts went positive,</v>

3644
02:37:59.541 --> 02:38:02.300
<v Speaker 2>it blossom like the most beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 2>flowers you can imagine.</v>

3645
02:38:02.450 --> 02:38:07.010
<v Speaker 2>It was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a lesson in thinking toxic Lee.</v>

3646
02:38:07.100 --> 02:38:10.400
<v Speaker 2>And then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is probably like 2008 ish,</v>

3647
02:38:10.550 --> 02:38:15.550
<v Speaker 2>somewhere around the end that that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>this particular experience that </v>

3648
02:38:15.550 --> 02:38:20.080
<v Speaker 2>literally changed who I am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally changed how I talked to </v>

3649
02:38:20.080 --> 02:38:20.930
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally change how I feel about people</v>

3650
02:38:21.200 --> 02:38:25.070
<v Speaker 2>watching a negative thought being </v>
<v Speaker 2>expresses his dark patterns and then the</v>

3651
02:38:25.071 --> 02:38:27.020
<v Speaker 2>positive thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just I just let it go.</v>

3652
02:38:27.020 --> 02:38:27.500
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3653
02:38:27.501 --> 02:38:28.800
<v Speaker 2>I see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see I'm doing it to myself.</v>

3654
02:38:28.801 --> 02:38:31.990
<v Speaker 2>And then boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he just relax and enjoy.</v>

3655
02:38:32.040 --> 02:38:34.790
<v Speaker 2>This is so beautiful and because you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at something so beautiful,</v>

3656
02:38:34.880 --> 02:38:39.340
<v Speaker 2>that feeling of seeing beauty makes it </v>
<v Speaker 2>more beautiful and just getting more and</v>

3657
02:38:39.370 --> 02:38:41.050
<v Speaker 2>like tears were rolling down my eyes and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mrs.</v>

3658
02:38:41.180 --> 02:38:42.840
<v Speaker 2>Stunning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stunning experience.</v>

3659
02:38:44.570 --> 02:38:46.750
<v Speaker 2>It's easier to do that now besides that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>

3660
02:38:46.751 --> 02:38:51.751
<v Speaker 2>I know what you mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like wish I could remember seeing it </v>

3661
02:38:51.751 --> 02:38:54.061
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember it happened and I remember </v>

3662
02:38:54.061 --> 02:38:54.061
<v Speaker 2>the dark green and black,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's so.</v>

3663
02:38:54.061 --> 02:38:55.880
<v Speaker 2>I remember so little of what I actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>saw.</v>

3664
02:38:55.881 --> 02:39:00.200
<v Speaker 2>It's a total recreation in my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a real problem with memory.</v>

3665
02:39:00.440 --> 02:39:05.440
<v Speaker 2>So real problem with regular memory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Forget about something spectacularly </v>

3666
02:39:05.440 --> 02:39:06.380
<v Speaker 2>unique and odd as a psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience,</v>

3667
02:39:06.620 --> 02:39:07.690
<v Speaker 2>but just regular memory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3668
02:39:07.730 --> 02:39:09.380
<v Speaker 2>I try to think of what I did yesterday.</v>

3669
02:39:09.500 --> 02:39:14.500
<v Speaker 2>I know what I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever get the information like </v>

3670
02:39:14.500 --> 02:39:17.530
<v Speaker 2>the last time I did it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what really blew me away is </v>

3671
02:39:17.530 --> 02:39:18.890
<v Speaker 2>because my girl was saying I was going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I won't forget by the way.</v>

3672
02:39:18.891 --> 02:39:21.080
<v Speaker 2>I forgot immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a joke joke.</v>

3673
02:39:21.081 --> 02:39:23.960
<v Speaker 2>You have to write it down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm supposed to talk into a microphone,</v>

3674
02:39:24.410 --> 02:39:29.410
<v Speaker 2>talk into a recorder like right away </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you get out and then try to </v>

3675
02:39:29.410 --> 02:39:32.180
<v Speaker 2>decipher that because usually I feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>like I can't talk.</v>

3676
02:39:32.290 --> 02:39:37.290
<v Speaker 2>As soon as you can know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you to do is use the voice app on </v>

3677
02:39:37.290 --> 02:39:39.230
<v Speaker 2>your phone and as soon as you can talk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hit record and just ramble.</v>

3678
02:39:39.290 --> 02:39:40.070
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to go,</v>

3679
02:39:40.071 --> 02:39:45.071
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a fucking moron because it's going </v>

3680
02:39:45.071 --> 02:39:45.071
<v Speaker 2>to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're sober,</v>

3681
02:39:45.071 --> 02:39:47.870
<v Speaker 2>it's going to sound so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I lost the inner journey and better</v>

3682
02:39:47.871 --> 02:39:52.871
<v Speaker 2>like on the inside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the outside you're just puking and </v>

3683
02:39:52.871 --> 02:39:53.330
<v Speaker 2>projectile shitting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shivering like an idiot.</v>

3684
02:39:53.570 --> 02:39:58.570
<v Speaker 2>That's a metaphor for twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There shouldn't be a which will be on </v>

3685
02:39:58.570 --> 02:40:01.930
<v Speaker 2>that shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like not being on fucking social media </v>

3686
02:40:01.930 --> 02:40:03.560
<v Speaker 2>the level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because at one point I was,</v>

3687
02:40:03.710 --> 02:40:07.610
<v Speaker 2>I remember I would read like salon.com</v>
<v Speaker 2>to fucking be annoyed.</v>

3688
02:40:08.360 --> 02:40:11.210
<v Speaker 2>I didn't notice it like you're doing it </v>
<v Speaker 2>on purpose.</v>

3689
02:40:12.010 --> 02:40:14.190
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even realize how much I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3690
02:40:14.280 --> 02:40:14.820
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my leg.</v>

3691
02:40:15.320 --> 02:40:20.320
<v Speaker 4>It's like a conflict addiction and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>becomes like some weird Russia people </v>

3692
02:40:20.320 --> 02:40:22.830
<v Speaker 4>get journal masochism no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just a fucking thing of.</v>

3693
02:40:23.790 --> 02:40:26.490
<v Speaker 4>Especially if you have a mannequin kind </v>
<v Speaker 4>of personalities,</v>

3694
02:40:27.530 --> 02:40:30.580
<v Speaker 1>it's why is why you to share.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You share this,</v>

3695
02:40:30.581 --> 02:40:31.810
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've overcome this.</v>

3696
02:40:31.960 --> 02:40:36.960
<v Speaker 1>He's in the grips of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's in the grips of doing battle </v>

3697
02:40:36.960 --> 02:40:36.960
<v Speaker 1>everyday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>puts on his fucking twitter.</v>

3698
02:40:36.970 --> 02:40:41.140
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe the amount of energy </v>
<v Speaker 1>spent on there,</v>

3699
02:40:41.410 --> 02:40:44.710
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not saying don't pull that shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>on twitter,</v>

3700
02:40:44.711 --> 02:40:47.620
<v Speaker 1>but don't look who gives a shit what </v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody says he has.</v>

3701
02:40:47.650 --> 02:40:48.940
<v Speaker 1>You've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've had issues with it.</v>

3702
02:40:48.970 --> 02:40:53.970
<v Speaker 1>Like you and I talked about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were you like you would get in these </v>

3703
02:40:53.970 --> 02:40:53.970
<v Speaker 1>twitter beefs and you won't be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep cortisol.</v>

3704
02:40:53.970 --> 02:40:58.771
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing that addicts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had a gambling is actually losing to </v>

3705
02:40:58.771 --> 02:40:58.771
<v Speaker 1>die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't know.</v>

3706
02:40:58.771 --> 02:41:00.340
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not a smart thing to do with your</v>

3707
02:41:00.341 --> 02:41:05.341
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't see why that would be good for </v>

<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you think like you'd come come up</v>

<v Speaker 1>that with people.</v>

3710
02:41:08.030 --> 02:41:13.030
<v Speaker 1>It would show me how to like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it could show you like use twitter </v>

3711
02:41:13.030 --> 02:41:17.731
<v Speaker 1>to represent who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just fucking hard to represent who </v>

3712
02:41:17.731 --> 02:41:17.740
<v Speaker 1>you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard in print.</v>

<v Speaker 4>The writing jokes going on there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's promote where I'm going to be made.</v>

<v Speaker 4>want to hear you.</v>

02:42:36.770 --> 02:42:36.770
<v Speaker 4>10 will be funny maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're not paying me for this,</v>

<v Speaker 4>so I'm just allowing you to see my </v>
<v Speaker 4>process.</v>

3745
02:42:39.090 --> 02:42:41.550

<v Speaker 4>these little shitheads a little entitled</v>
<v Speaker 4>foodies.</v>

3750
02:42:54.600 --> 02:42:59.600
<v Speaker 4>So you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how is this nothing writing about Dave </v>

<v Speaker 4>where do you get the balls?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's because they're,</v>

3754
02:43:04.260 --> 02:43:05.940
<v Speaker 4>they're being made to feel like an </v>
<v Speaker 4>insider.</v>

3755
02:43:06.090 --> 02:43:09.240
<v Speaker 4>The same as trump is like an every man </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking dipshit,</v>

3756
02:43:09.570 --> 02:43:12.340
<v Speaker 4>you know Joe Joe bag of donuts.</v>

3757
02:43:12.340 --> 02:43:17.110
<v Speaker 3>Like dom called.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That guy is a guy like me to talk to me.</v>

3758
02:43:17.350 --> 02:43:19.360
<v Speaker 3>Finally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's about that.</v>

3759
02:43:19.361 --> 02:43:22.750
<v Speaker 3>Now there are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They hate like an elite or an expert.</v>

3760
02:43:23.840 --> 02:43:25.230
<v Speaker 3>Experts of what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People over there.</v>

3761
02:43:25.540 --> 02:43:28.280
<v Speaker 3>We went on several times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's,</v>

3762
02:43:28.300 --> 02:43:30.610
<v Speaker 3>let's bring it back to the people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are writing.</v>

3763
02:43:30.820 --> 02:43:32.260
<v Speaker 3>So these people that are writing these </v>
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

3764
02:43:32.261 --> 02:43:37.261
<v Speaker 3>a lot of them when they're in their </v>
<v Speaker 3>twenties and we would all have done the </v>

3765
02:43:37.261 --> 02:43:37.261
<v Speaker 3>same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the exact same thing when you're in your</v>

3766
02:43:37.261 --> 02:43:38.950
<v Speaker 3>twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

3767
02:43:39.120 --> 02:43:42.920
<v Speaker 3>You thought just like that when you hold</v>
<v Speaker 3>on when you were a writer and you,</v>

3768
02:43:42.930 --> 02:43:46.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you were writing a blog for some sort</v>

3769
02:43:46.181 --> 02:43:48.970
<v Speaker 3>of online publication and you decided to</v>
<v Speaker 3>take an angle,</v>

3770
02:43:49.240 --> 02:43:51.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this Dave Chappelle specials,</v>

3771
02:43:51.101 --> 02:43:53.860
<v Speaker 3>not that big a deal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then just go run with that.</v>

3772
02:43:53.861 --> 02:43:55.630
<v Speaker 3>You would probably do the exact fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>same thing.</v>

3773
02:43:55.900 --> 02:43:57.430
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people that do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3774
02:43:57.431 --> 02:43:58.810
<v Speaker 3>no fathers review.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I told you,</v>

3775
02:43:58.811 --> 02:44:03.811
<v Speaker 3>I'm a sucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I would review it and say what I </v>

3776
02:44:03.811 --> 02:44:04.540
<v Speaker 3>thought about the hour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's not what's done.</v>

3777
02:44:04.600 --> 02:44:06.520
<v Speaker 3>And I know for a fact that's not how </v>
<v Speaker 3>these people do.</v>

3778
02:44:06.521 --> 02:44:07.540
<v Speaker 3>And if you've talked to them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they go,</v>

3779
02:44:07.570 --> 02:44:10.780
<v Speaker 3>I got to say I don't like somebody </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I liked the political reason.</v>

3780
02:44:11.230 --> 02:44:11.770
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3781
02:44:11.771 --> 02:44:13.160
<v Speaker 3>I know what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>

3782
02:44:13.170 --> 02:44:15.130
<v Speaker 3>Nothing is based on funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3783
02:44:15.131 --> 02:44:20.131
<v Speaker 3>it was always like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now there's an added political </v>

3784
02:44:20.131 --> 02:44:21.790
<v Speaker 3>element of not funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's a whole la La land section of it.</v>

3785
02:44:21.850 --> 02:44:26.850
<v Speaker 3>There's a whole section where up is down</v>
<v Speaker 3>and right is left and whatever the fuck </v>

3786
02:44:26.850 --> 02:44:31.081
<v Speaker 3>you say becomes doctrine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People like to make Dane Cook a </v>

3787
02:44:31.081 --> 02:44:32.230
<v Speaker 3>punchline that I have half the people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that would do that.</v>

3788
02:44:32.231 --> 02:44:37.231
<v Speaker 3>I haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They haven't made me laugh even a </v>

3789
02:44:37.231 --> 02:44:37.231
<v Speaker 3>little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as much as they can cook,</v>

3790
02:44:37.231 --> 02:44:37.231
<v Speaker 3>so I'm wondering.</v>

3791
02:44:37.231 --> 02:44:41.900
<v Speaker 3>It's a free shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like carrot top people will take a </v>

3792
02:44:41.900 --> 02:44:44.401
<v Speaker 3>free shot at carrot top.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even see these fucking punk </v>

3793
02:44:44.401 --> 02:44:46.720
<v Speaker 3>millennials now doing the work and built</v>
<v Speaker 3>those props.</v>

3794
02:44:46.750 --> 02:44:48.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>carrot top is a funny guy.</v>

3795
02:44:48.760 --> 02:44:50.770
<v Speaker 3>He's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he's a good comic.</v>

3796
02:44:50.830 --> 02:44:53.350
<v Speaker 3>Like you could go see a show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a silly funny show,</v>

3797
02:44:53.440 --> 02:44:58.440
<v Speaker 3>but it has punchline sample.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think they literally just a new kind of </v>

3798
02:44:58.440 --> 02:45:00.130
<v Speaker 3>comedy that doesn't have sort of punch </v>
<v Speaker 3>set up.</v>

3799
02:45:00.131 --> 02:45:05.131
<v Speaker 3>Punch line is not only good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's postmodern building block of the </v>

3800
02:45:05.131 --> 02:45:06.520
<v Speaker 3>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything is that.</v>

3801
02:45:06.540 --> 02:45:09.130
<v Speaker 3>If we fix post modern comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well you know what it is.</v>

3802
02:45:09.160 --> 02:45:10.480
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just aren't good at it.</v>

3803
02:45:10.540 --> 02:45:15.540
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the new way are press or like </v>

3804
02:45:15.540 --> 02:45:16.060
<v Speaker 3>every of activist by the way will tell </v>
<v Speaker 3>you they're a comedian,</v>

3805
02:45:16.090 --> 02:45:17.260
<v Speaker 3>but here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every single one,</v>

3806
02:45:17.290 --> 02:45:20.920
<v Speaker 3>if they like that style and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

3807
02:45:21.180 --> 02:45:23.440
<v Speaker 3>it's like someone saying to a jazz </v>
<v Speaker 3>guitarist,</v>

3808
02:45:23.441 --> 02:45:24.000
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

3809
02:45:24.001 --> 02:45:27.100
<v Speaker 3>you can't play for shit because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't play like Hendrix.</v>

3810
02:45:27.250 --> 02:45:27.780
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3811
02:45:27.781 --> 02:45:31.090
<v Speaker 3>but they don't want to go to do this and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand that,</v>

3812
02:45:31.091 --> 02:45:34.570
<v Speaker 3>but I understand because I don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>appreciate music or whatever,</v>

3813
02:45:34.571 --> 02:45:36.430
<v Speaker 3>how I should appreciate it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I totally get that,</v>

3814
02:45:36.431 --> 02:45:39.430
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think I could just walk and </v>
<v Speaker 3>play guitar.</v>

3815
02:45:39.630 --> 02:45:41.380
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just a different genre though,</v>

3816
02:45:41.381 --> 02:45:43.090
<v Speaker 3>because the whole thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>according to me,</v>

3817
02:45:43.091 --> 02:45:46.390
<v Speaker 3>it's other lowercase igeneration like </v>
<v Speaker 3>right out of apple products.</v>

3818
02:45:46.420 --> 02:45:51.420
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's also an applied snobbishness </v>

3819
02:45:51.420 --> 02:45:53.791
<v Speaker 3>were the people that are not doing the </v>
<v Speaker 3>punchlines feel like what they're doing </v>

3820
02:45:53.791 --> 02:45:56.340
<v Speaker 3>is somehow or another better than </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who does classic setup,</v>

3821
02:45:56.350 --> 02:45:59.530
<v Speaker 3>punchline sort of joke writing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's ridiculous.</v>

3822
02:45:59.560 --> 02:46:01.900
<v Speaker 3>It's ridiculous because it's not better </v>
<v Speaker 3>or worse and you know,</v>

3823
02:46:01.901 --> 02:46:05.620
<v Speaker 3>you don't get Brownie points just </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're eclectic or just because.</v>

3824
02:46:05.621 --> 02:46:08.860
<v Speaker 3>Because you didn't know your alternative</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit was old Steve Martin bits.</v>

3825
02:46:08.870 --> 02:46:10.070
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dennis Miller,</v>

3826
02:46:10.340 --> 02:46:11.660
<v Speaker 3>that's where it gets really funny.</v>

3827
02:46:11.810 --> 02:46:16.810
<v Speaker 3>Like Dennis Miller,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dennis Miller was super alton a lot of </v>

3828
02:46:16.810 --> 02:46:19.451
<v Speaker 3>ways he would be telling these set of </v>
<v Speaker 3>punch punchlines about shit that you </v>

3829
02:46:19.451 --> 02:46:23.381
<v Speaker 3>definitely didn't know what the fuck he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was talking about and you would laugh </v>

3830
02:46:23.381 --> 02:46:23.750
<v Speaker 3>anyway because you didn't want to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought of as stupid.</v>

3831
02:46:24.110 --> 02:46:26.340
<v Speaker 3>There was a bunch of people that laughed</v>
<v Speaker 3>at Dennis Miller's jokes.</v>

3832
02:46:26.350 --> 02:46:28.850
<v Speaker 3>They didn't have a fucking clue as to </v>
<v Speaker 3>what he was saying.</v>

3833
02:46:28.880 --> 02:46:33.880
<v Speaker 3>Mark Twain had cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just Mark Twain wrote a whole book as a </v>

3834
02:46:35.361 --> 02:46:37.100
<v Speaker 3>joke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which book was that?</v>

3835
02:46:37.130 --> 02:46:38.590
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember this.</v>

3836
02:46:38.650 --> 02:46:40.490
<v Speaker 3>I remember it was like having everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3837
02:46:40.520 --> 02:46:45.520
<v Speaker 3>review it and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it was real and he was just </v>

3838
02:46:45.520 --> 02:46:45.620
<v Speaker 3>laughing his ass off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think if you write the book,</v>

3839
02:46:45.621 --> 02:46:48.210
<v Speaker 3>it says a joke at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sounds like you wrote a book.</v>

3840
02:46:48.230 --> 02:46:50.090
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like you bang a guy's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>joke.</v>

3841
02:46:51.850 --> 02:46:54.020
<v Speaker 3>He wrote it as a satire and people took </v>
<v Speaker 3>it as fact.</v>

3842
02:46:55.270 --> 02:46:57.880
<v Speaker 3>Postmodern comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was one of my first jokes in colleges.</v>

3843
02:46:57.890 --> 02:46:59.150
<v Speaker 3>I knock,</v>
<v Speaker 3>knock.</v>

3844
02:46:59.151 --> 02:47:00.620
<v Speaker 3>Who's there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pineapple.</v>

3845
02:47:00.650 --> 02:47:03.540
<v Speaker 3>Who are you to say what funny is?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh God,</v>

3846
02:47:04.040 --> 02:47:05.740
<v Speaker 3>because it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a.in</v>

3847
02:47:05.741 --> 02:47:06.770
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a painting.</v>

3848
02:47:06.771 --> 02:47:09.700
<v Speaker 3>It's like childhood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You listen,</v>

3849
02:47:09.701 --> 02:47:14.701
<v Speaker 3>if you pay it to see me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can determine if I did my job and </v>

3850
02:47:14.701 --> 02:47:14.701
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3851
02:47:14.701 --> 02:47:16.310
<v Speaker 3>you have your take on it and people have</v>
<v Speaker 3>their take on it.</v>

3852
02:47:16.311 --> 02:47:18.500
<v Speaker 3>But like there's certain guys that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3853
02:47:18.590 --> 02:47:19.790
<v Speaker 3>they're just funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3854
02:47:20.100 --> 02:47:22.130
<v Speaker 3>And you could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could see someone saying,</v>

3855
02:47:22.131 --> 02:47:23.330
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like perfect example,</v>

3856
02:47:23.331 --> 02:47:24.890
<v Speaker 3>setup punchline,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mitch Hedberg.</v>

3857
02:47:25.070 --> 02:47:27.640
<v Speaker 3>If you say that's not funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck you,</v>

3858
02:47:27.720 --> 02:47:29.090
<v Speaker 3>you're lying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just fuck you.</v>

3859
02:47:29.390 --> 02:47:31.580
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because he's clever.</v>

3860
02:47:31.700 --> 02:47:33.410
<v Speaker 3>It's set up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>

3861
02:47:33.620 --> 02:47:37.990
<v Speaker 3>It's eight minutes for reasons outside </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the.</v>

3862
02:47:38.360 --> 02:47:43.360
<v Speaker 3>When people tell you someone who's funny</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they say they own funny or vice </v>

3863
02:47:43.360 --> 02:47:47.621
<v Speaker 3>versa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's because they're judging for things </v>

3864
02:47:47.621 --> 02:47:47.820
<v Speaker 3>that have nothing to do with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>material or the funding.</v>

3865
02:47:48.460 --> 02:47:53.460
<v Speaker 3>Like I've heard people say like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh don't like a guy that stands Julie </v>

3866
02:47:53.460 --> 02:47:54.320
<v Speaker 3>had a fair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a fair critique,</v>

3867
02:47:54.660 --> 02:47:55.190
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or.</v>

3868
02:47:55.340 --> 02:47:57.080
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's the case with music too,</v>

3869
02:47:57.081 --> 02:48:02.081
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you might not like Bob Dylan's </v>

3870
02:48:02.081 --> 02:48:02.081
<v Speaker 3>voice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3871
02:48:02.081 --> 02:48:02.081
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to hear it,</v>

3872
02:48:02.081 --> 02:48:03.830
<v Speaker 3>and that's a legit concern.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a legit concern.</v>

3873
02:48:04.430 --> 02:48:06.480
<v Speaker 3>Can have their thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got no issue with that.</v>

3874
02:48:06.540 --> 02:48:09.990
<v Speaker 3>Comedy is not just what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's how you're saying it's now.</v>

3875
02:48:09.991 --> 02:48:13.030
<v Speaker 3>It sounds to people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but why destroy cities?</v>

3876
02:48:13.040 --> 02:48:15.860
<v Speaker 3>What I was saying like if you don't like</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody's fucking coming into,</v>

3877
02:48:15.861 --> 02:48:17.400
<v Speaker 3>that's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they don't.</v>

3878
02:48:17.410 --> 02:48:20.420
<v Speaker 3>People do that with bands though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's groups out that need to destroy.</v>

3879
02:48:20.480 --> 02:48:25.480
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I can't trust for you to enjoy it </v>

3880
02:48:25.480 --> 02:48:25.480
<v Speaker 3>because I don't know how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know people want to take,</v>

3881
02:48:25.790 --> 02:48:30.790
<v Speaker 3>but how is it different than shit and on</v>
<v Speaker 3>people like nickelback don't shit on </v>

3882
02:48:30.790 --> 02:48:31.580
<v Speaker 3>people like nickelback will.</v>

3883
02:48:31.580 --> 02:48:33.430
<v Speaker 3>You're a beautiful person but it's not </v>
<v Speaker 3>real.</v>

3884
02:48:33.920 --> 02:48:36.070
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of the same sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>

3885
02:48:36.071 --> 02:48:37.990
<v Speaker 3>It seems like we just decided this up a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit.</v>

3886
02:48:38.030 --> 02:48:41.520
<v Speaker 3>Feel like I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was pretending to enjoy the show.</v>

3887
02:48:42.770 --> 02:48:45.320
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you bragging that you have that week</v>

3888
02:48:45.321 --> 02:48:50.321
<v Speaker 3>of a person that you were just going </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the crowd and like a thing you </v>

3889
02:48:50.321 --> 02:48:50.321
<v Speaker 3>didn't enjoy too trying to hurt your </v>
<v Speaker 3>feelings?</v>

3890
02:48:50.321 --> 02:48:51.720
<v Speaker 3>And I think you know that as well as I </v>
<v Speaker 3>do that.</v>

3891
02:48:52.220 --> 02:48:57.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm just reading what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not so much you're arguing with a </v>

3892
02:48:57.220 --> 02:49:00.071
<v Speaker 3>nonsense person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I don't go on social media </v>

3893
02:49:00.071 --> 02:49:00.530
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just as these arguments with people</v>

3894
02:49:00.531 --> 02:49:05.531
<v Speaker 3>that aren't even fucking say to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't even understand what I'm.</v>

3895
02:49:09.540 --> 02:49:12.320
<v Speaker 2>This is my point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't say I read the Shingo.</v>

3896
02:49:12.600 --> 02:49:14.400
<v Speaker 2>Nothing like I save it for the Rogan </v>
<v Speaker 2>show,</v>

3897
02:49:14.950 --> 02:49:16.770
<v Speaker 2>but beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the way to go.</v>

3898
02:49:16.940 --> 02:49:18.660
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd say bring it to the Rogan show.</v>

3899
02:49:18.840 --> 02:49:20.370
<v Speaker 2>That's always a good move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>

3900
02:49:20.371 --> 02:49:21.800
<v Speaker 2>I just listened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3901
02:49:21.810 --> 02:49:26.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fun as long as you don't get too </v>

3902
02:49:26.810 --> 02:49:27.330
<v Speaker 2>caught up in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the reality is if I had a friend who</v>

3903
02:49:27.331 --> 02:49:32.331
<v Speaker 2>got into something online and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it went sideways and my advice was,</v>

3904
02:49:32.970 --> 02:49:37.970
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what happens when it goes </v>

3905
02:49:37.970 --> 02:49:37.970
<v Speaker 2>sideways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3906
02:49:37.970 --> 02:49:41.750
<v Speaker 2>So if there's a situation where you feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's going sideways and a bunch of </v>

3907
02:49:41.750 --> 02:49:41.750
<v Speaker 2>people are gonna attack you for no </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason,</v>

3908
02:49:41.750 --> 02:49:45.310
<v Speaker 2>step away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just step away because if you engage you</v>

3909
02:49:45.360 --> 02:49:50.360
<v Speaker 2>essentially trusting your emotional </v>
<v Speaker 2>state to a bunch of people that have no </v>

3910
02:49:50.360 --> 02:49:54.681
<v Speaker 2>concern for your wellbeing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they want to attack you and hurt </v>

3911
02:49:54.681 --> 02:49:54.681
<v Speaker 2>your feelings.</v>

3912
02:49:54.681 --> 02:49:56.430
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to like plead it down </v>
<v Speaker 2>to like,</v>

3913
02:49:56.431 --> 02:50:01.431
<v Speaker 2>well mildly upset with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now they have this idea and you are the </v>

3914
02:50:01.431 --> 02:50:03.750
<v Speaker 2>target and you as a person who's in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>public eye as a celebrity,</v>

3915
02:50:04.050 --> 02:50:09.050
<v Speaker 2>you know this person is you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are thought of as someone who </v>

3916
02:50:09.050 --> 02:50:13.730
<v Speaker 2>already has some extra privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're thought of as someone who's </v>

3917
02:50:13.730 --> 02:50:15.330
<v Speaker 2>already already stealing something from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the rest of us.</v>

3918
02:50:15.510 --> 02:50:19.440
<v Speaker 2>You already get some easy free ride </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of your talent or your notoriety</v>

3919
02:50:19.441 --> 02:50:22.880
<v Speaker 2>or whatever the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they feel like there's extra licensed</v>

3920
02:50:22.881 --> 02:50:25.410
<v Speaker 2>to fuck with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do that too.</v>

3921
02:50:25.411 --> 02:50:27.480
<v Speaker 2>Where I feel like someone is so big and </v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful,</v>

3922
02:50:27.510 --> 02:50:28.650
<v Speaker 2>like I'm not talking to him,</v>

3923
02:50:28.890 --> 02:50:32.840
<v Speaker 5>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is</v>

3924
02:50:32.870 --> 02:50:34.750
<v Speaker 2>successful enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In my mind I'm like,</v>

3925
02:50:34.900 --> 02:50:37.420
<v Speaker 2>it's not even engaging with the person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3926
02:50:37.750 --> 02:50:40.390
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want you to send all your tweets to me</v>

3927
02:50:40.391 --> 02:50:43.530
<v Speaker 2>first before you tweet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Delay is the delay.</v>

3928
02:50:43.540 --> 02:50:48.540
<v Speaker 2>You send them to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you the thumbs up and thumbs </v>

3929
02:50:48.540 --> 02:50:48.540
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No more tweeting.</v>

3930
02:50:48.540 --> 02:50:53.530
<v Speaker 2>Just texts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just saying shit to Barry crimmins </v>

3931
02:50:53.530 --> 02:50:53.530
<v Speaker 2>directly for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3932
02:50:53.530 --> 02:50:55.660
<v Speaker 2>that's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same thing what I'm saying from power of</v>

3933
02:50:55.661 --> 02:50:59.100
<v Speaker 2>attorney over like only he has my </v>
<v Speaker 2>password.</v>

3934
02:50:59.101 --> 02:51:01.150
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't even know listening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're friends.</v>

3935
02:51:01.151 --> 02:51:06.151
<v Speaker 2>I don't want your password,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do want you to send all your </v>

3936
02:51:06.151 --> 02:51:06.240
<v Speaker 2>tweets to me for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should try that.</v>

3937
02:51:06.260 --> 02:51:07.230
<v Speaker 2>That'd be so funny.</v>

3938
02:51:09.310 --> 02:51:14.310
<v Speaker 2>Let me tell you something about Barry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because Barry was responsible for the </v>

3939
02:51:14.310 --> 02:51:14.310
<v Speaker 2>environment I came up in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I came up in Boston,</v>

3940
02:51:14.310 --> 02:51:15.360
<v Speaker 2>Barry Crimmins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he created.</v>

3941
02:51:16.000 --> 02:51:18.070
<v Speaker 2>He didn't create it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He set a tone.</v>

3942
02:51:18.250 --> 02:51:18.880
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3943
02:51:18.881 --> 02:51:21.100
<v Speaker 2>no hacks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good writing,</v>

3944
02:51:21.430 --> 02:51:26.430
<v Speaker 2>no thieves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He set a tone and that tone was fucking </v>

3945
02:51:26.430 --> 02:51:29.500
<v Speaker 2>rock solid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were all these big fucking men.</v>

3946
02:51:29.501 --> 02:51:33.290
<v Speaker 2>Like Lenny Clarke is a big guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kevin Knox was a big guy.</v>

3947
02:51:33.291 --> 02:51:35.800
<v Speaker 2>There were a manly men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They weren't like these neat,</v>

3948
02:51:35.980 --> 02:51:39.130
<v Speaker 2>like nerdy type,</v>
<v Speaker 2>skinny little comedians.</v>

3949
02:51:39.131 --> 02:51:44.131
<v Speaker 2>They were fucking savages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did coke and they were punching </v>

3950
02:51:44.131 --> 02:51:44.131
<v Speaker 2>each other all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They never paid taxes.</v>

3951
02:51:44.131 --> 02:51:48.960
<v Speaker 2>These fucking guys were animals and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Barry crimmins started the whole thing </v>

3952
02:51:48.960 --> 02:51:52.981
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was so good and so smart and so well </v>

3953
02:51:52.981 --> 02:51:53.410
<v Speaker 2>read and so aware of what's going on in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

3954
02:51:53.500 --> 02:51:56.200
<v Speaker 2>He set a tone for the entire and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's scared of him.</v>

3955
02:51:56.290 --> 02:52:00.550
<v Speaker 2>I was terrified of him when that guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>started reaching out to me and we became</v>

3956
02:52:00.551 --> 02:52:05.551
<v Speaker 2>friends online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like way after I'd already been </v>

3957
02:52:05.551 --> 02:52:05.551
<v Speaker 2>on television,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

3958
02:52:05.551 --> 02:52:06.100
<v Speaker 2>I was so happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like Barry crimmins</v>

3959
02:52:06.100 --> 02:52:07.760
<v Speaker 3>likes me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yes.</v>

3960
02:52:07.840 --> 02:52:12.840
<v Speaker 3>I think you're one of the good guys and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you're a hero and he's telling </v>

3961
02:52:12.840 --> 02:52:15.391
<v Speaker 3>me all this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To me it was like that was the dawn of </v>

3962
02:52:15.391 --> 02:52:18.370
<v Speaker 3>comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was the fucking main guy that started</v>

3963
02:52:18.371 --> 02:52:19.510
<v Speaker 3>it off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3964
02:52:19.600 --> 02:52:24.600
<v Speaker 3>Do you have that with people?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I felt that way when you wrote to me </v>

3965
02:52:24.600 --> 02:52:24.600
<v Speaker 3>Matt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3966
02:52:24.600 --> 02:52:25.630
<v Speaker 3>that's nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3967
02:52:27.540 --> 02:52:28.390

<v Speaker 3>he was terrible.</v>

3968
02:52:29.050 --> 02:52:34.050
<v Speaker 3>He was so smart and so he was so well </v>
<v Speaker 3>versed in politics and what was going </v>

3969
02:52:34.050 --> 02:52:38.791
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>making dared not bring up Guatemala or </v>

3970
02:52:38.791 --> 02:52:40.090
<v Speaker 3>Nicaragua around him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't talk about the conscious,</v>

3971
02:52:40.091 --> 02:52:45.091
<v Speaker 3>the Sandinistas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was like the last progressive </v>

3972
02:52:45.091 --> 02:52:45.091
<v Speaker 3>like bay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a left wing dude.</v>

3973
02:52:45.350 --> 02:52:48.340
<v Speaker 3>Believe say there's no because America </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't have that.</v>

3974
02:52:48.341 --> 02:52:50.650
<v Speaker 3>We have just reactionaries and that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>what America is.</v>

3975
02:52:50.651 --> 02:52:54.370
<v Speaker 3>It's all reactionary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a masculine progressive,</v>

3976
02:52:54.500 --> 02:52:55.280
<v Speaker 3>right man.</v>

3977
02:52:55.300 --> 02:53:00.300
<v Speaker 3>He was a masculine progressive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like an aggressive fuck you masculine </v>

3978
02:53:00.431 --> 02:53:04.000
<v Speaker 3>progressive guy who was anti racist and </v>
<v Speaker 3>anti sexual harassment,</v>

3979
02:53:04.001 --> 02:53:08.020
<v Speaker 3>anti obviously anti-sex abuse because of</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's happened to him to protect her.</v>

3980
02:53:08.050 --> 02:53:10.780
<v Speaker 3>He would go on stage and he would ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a fucking,</v>

3981
02:53:10.781 --> 02:53:15.781
<v Speaker 3>like a professor's jacket on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had reached into it and pull out a </v>

3982
02:53:15.781 --> 02:53:18.721
<v Speaker 3>budweiser.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every time he had a budweiser in his </v>

3983
02:53:18.721 --> 02:53:20.710
<v Speaker 3>pocket that was like half a shtick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drink American beer and he put that shit</v>

3984
02:53:20.711 --> 02:53:22.330
<v Speaker 3>right on the counter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like right in front of you.</v>

3985
02:53:22.360 --> 02:53:27.360
<v Speaker 3>It was like half of what he did was he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was this guy that was sick of all this </v>

3986
02:53:28.961 --> 02:53:32.030
<v Speaker 3>fucking nonsense around him and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

3987
02:53:32.220 --> 02:53:37.220
<v Speaker 3>he had like this real clear intention of</v>
<v Speaker 3>like this is what's going to be </v>

3988
02:53:37.220 --> 02:53:38.640
<v Speaker 3>tolerated and this end his actors like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that too.</v>

3989
02:53:38.641 --> 02:53:39.730
<v Speaker 3>And you'd go to watch him.</v>

3990
02:53:39.970 --> 02:53:43.180
<v Speaker 3>You would literally like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was so powerful that you would change</v>

3991
02:53:43.181 --> 02:53:44.580
<v Speaker 3>like your politically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

3992
02:53:44.830 --> 02:53:49.830
<v Speaker 3>if you were in any way liked about him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that because I don't mind anybody's </v>

3993
02:53:49.890 --> 02:53:54.890
<v Speaker 3>beliefs if they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well thought out if you have so much of </v>

3994
02:53:54.890 --> 02:53:57.991
<v Speaker 3>a trend of terrain devoted to something </v>
<v Speaker 3>and if it's disgusting to you,</v>

3995
02:54:00.941 --> 02:54:01.900
<v Speaker 3>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should.</v>

3996
02:54:01.960 --> 02:54:06.960
<v Speaker 3>Like when you said that privileged thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about like where people </v>

3997
02:54:06.960 --> 02:54:06.960
<v Speaker 3>are taking it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>acknowledging their privilege.</v>

3998
02:54:07.060 --> 02:54:12.060
<v Speaker 3>Did anybody read.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll go read your scriptures when you </v>

3999
02:54:12.060 --> 02:54:13.090
<v Speaker 3>tell me about these ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the privileged checklist.</v>

4000
02:54:13.210 --> 02:54:16.580
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever read that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Peggy Mcintosh privilege was.</v>

4001
02:54:16.600 --> 02:54:21.600
<v Speaker 3>Who's Peggy Mcintosh?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The one that kicked off this fucking </v>

4002
02:54:21.600 --> 02:54:24.091
<v Speaker 3>amazing privilege concept of white </v>
<v Speaker 3>privilege based on her ideas on male </v>

4003
02:54:24.311 --> 02:54:25.450
<v Speaker 3>privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

4004
02:54:25.740 --> 02:54:28.150
<v Speaker 3>The what it's called,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the unpacking,</v>

4005
02:54:28.480 --> 02:54:30.610
<v Speaker 3>the invisible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a white privileged knapsack.</v>

4006
02:54:30.700 --> 02:54:33.430
<v Speaker 3>I love when they say unpacking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can unpack that for you.</v>

4007
02:54:33.460 --> 02:54:35.110
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first white privilege is you call it</v>

4008
02:54:35.111 --> 02:54:36.850
<v Speaker 3>a knapsack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's step one,</v>

4009
02:54:37.510 --> 02:54:42.510
<v Speaker 3>but it's clearly just this rich college </v>
<v Speaker 3>ladies privileges that she just saw </v>

4010
02:54:43.120 --> 02:54:46.090
<v Speaker 3>white privilege unpacking the invisible </v>
<v Speaker 3>backpack.</v>

4011
02:54:46.510 --> 02:54:48.400
<v Speaker 3>Every fucking thing that when I used to </v>
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>

4012
02:54:48.401 --> 02:54:50.770
<v Speaker 3>please go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go and educate yourself.</v>

4013
02:54:50.800 --> 02:54:51.430
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hold on,</v>

4014
02:54:51.640 --> 02:54:54.640
<v Speaker 3>hold on please.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Through the work to bring materials from</v>

4015
02:54:54.641 --> 02:54:57.190
<v Speaker 3>women's studies into the rest of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>curriculum.</v>

4016
02:54:57.580 --> 02:55:02.580
<v Speaker 3>I have often noticed men's unwillingness</v>
<v Speaker 3>to grant that they are overprivileged </v>

4017
02:55:02.580 --> 02:55:05.210
<v Speaker 3>even though they may grant that women </v>
<v Speaker 3>are disadvantaged.</v>

4018
02:55:05.780 --> 02:55:07.400
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like she hates women in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

4019
02:55:08.150 --> 02:55:09.320
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a weird thing,</v>

4020
02:55:09.370 --> 02:55:12.110
<v Speaker 3>like see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the thing is very important.</v>

4021
02:55:12.350 --> 02:55:16.520
<v Speaker 3>This kind of person thinks that your </v>
<v Speaker 3>rights are fucking privileges.</v>

4022
02:55:16.640 --> 02:55:21.640
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so most of the list is going to be </v>

4023
02:55:21.640 --> 02:55:21.640
<v Speaker 3>things that are your basic human right </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that if,</v>

4024
02:55:21.640 --> 02:55:22.670
<v Speaker 3>let's say you're not getting because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not white,</v>

4025
02:55:22.730 --> 02:55:23.780
<v Speaker 3>you should be getting that.</v>

4026
02:55:23.810 --> 02:55:26.600
<v Speaker 3>It's not that I shouldn't be able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>move into a neighborhood I want.</v>

4027
02:55:26.630 --> 02:55:29.810
<v Speaker 3>It's that you should be able to also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're framing it as,</v>

4028
02:55:30.200 --> 02:55:35.200
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have undue privilege needs to be </v>

4029
02:55:35.200 --> 02:55:35.200
<v Speaker 3>taken away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like these are my store.</v>

4030
02:55:35.200 --> 02:55:36.950
<v Speaker 3>Did way of looking at an actual problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The actual problem is real racism.</v>

4031
02:55:37.130 --> 02:55:40.010
<v Speaker 3>The actual problem is real sexism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but instead of looking at that,</v>

4032
02:55:40.100 --> 02:55:43.960
<v Speaker 3>look at the people that are lucky that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not discriminated against.</v>

4033
02:55:44.030 --> 02:55:47.630
<v Speaker 3>A real hauling them somehow or another </v>
<v Speaker 3>somehow know perpetrators.</v>

4034
02:55:47.650 --> 02:55:52.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a real fat check way of looking at </v>

4035
02:55:52.650 --> 02:55:54.401
<v Speaker 3>life everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a real young,</v>

4036
02:55:54.801 --> 02:55:57.350
<v Speaker 3>shitty young girl way to look at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

4037
02:55:58.730 --> 02:56:03.730
<v Speaker 3>As long as you're not happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well there's a great quote that </v>

4038
02:56:03.730 --> 02:56:04.310
<v Speaker 3>socialist don't love the poor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They hate the rich.</v>

4039
02:56:04.520 --> 02:56:08.980
<v Speaker 3>That's a good quote and it's also.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also some people I'd be look buried</v>

4040
02:56:08.981 --> 02:56:12.450
<v Speaker 3>to me was a sincere dude and I would </v>
<v Speaker 3>listen to and he didn't have.</v>

4041
02:56:12.470 --> 02:56:17.470
<v Speaker 3>He would give you the shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the other thing of that scene </v>

4042
02:56:17.470 --> 02:56:19.891
<v Speaker 3>as barry would not really have a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>money because he be paying into the </v>

4043
02:56:19.891 --> 02:56:20.000
<v Speaker 3>comics and he really was a guy who was </v>
<v Speaker 3>generous,</v>

4044
02:56:20.060 --> 02:56:21.270
<v Speaker 3>generous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>generous guy.</v>

4045
02:56:21.271 --> 02:56:23.930
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean legitimately generous with his,</v>

4046
02:56:23.931 --> 02:56:26.000
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his adoration,</v>

4047
02:56:26.030 --> 02:56:31.030
<v Speaker 3>generous with the way promoted other </v>
<v Speaker 3>comics the way generously help people </v>

4048
02:56:31.030 --> 02:56:35.260
<v Speaker 3>but generous like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what he did for that scene on </v>

4049
02:56:35.260 --> 02:56:35.480
<v Speaker 3>real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He made that scene.</v>

4050
02:56:35.481 --> 02:56:38.570
<v Speaker 3>I mean everybody will admit that there </v>
<v Speaker 3>was a lot of great comics back then.</v>

4051
02:56:38.900 --> 02:56:39.300
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

4052
02:56:39.330 --> 02:56:40.310
<v Speaker 3>Steven Wright,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>

4053
02:56:40.311 --> 02:56:42.170
<v Speaker 3>there was a lot of great guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don Gavin,</v>

4054
02:56:42.190 --> 02:56:44.900
<v Speaker 3>who's one of the all time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my all time greatest.</v>

4055
02:56:45.350 --> 02:56:47.360
<v Speaker 3>There was all these great guys that were</v>
<v Speaker 3>in that area,</v>

4056
02:56:47.361 --> 02:56:52.361
<v Speaker 3>but this guy had something special and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he was by far the most well read out of </v>

4057
02:56:52.731 --> 02:56:53.180
<v Speaker 3>all of them.</v>

4058
02:56:53.650 --> 02:56:55.940
<v Speaker 3>And I think like abused kids have two </v>
<v Speaker 3>roads.</v>

4059
02:56:55.970 --> 02:56:59.150
<v Speaker 3>You either want other people to hurt or </v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to protect people.</v>

4060
02:56:59.210 --> 02:57:00.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you're right.</v>

4061
02:57:00.140 --> 02:57:05.140
<v Speaker 3>And I think that sometimes early trauma </v>
<v Speaker 3>can make you like just so protective of </v>

4062
02:57:05.140 --> 02:57:07.790
<v Speaker 3>the week where you hate when someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>takes advantage of vulnerability.</v>

4063
02:57:07.820 --> 02:57:09.790
<v Speaker 3>Very high was just prince.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had principles.</v>

4064
02:57:09.791 --> 02:57:14.791
<v Speaker 3>This is the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like somebody have a fucking </v>

4065
02:57:14.791 --> 02:57:14.791
<v Speaker 3>principle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Jamie Kilstein thing.</v>

4066
02:57:14.791 --> 02:57:15.110
<v Speaker 3>I had people write,</v>
<v Speaker 3>write and shit.</v>

4067
02:57:15.160 --> 02:57:20.160

<v Speaker 3>like ceased all facebook ads because </v>

4068
02:57:20.160 --> 02:57:20.160
<v Speaker 3>people are like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Do you think there's like,</v>

4071
02:57:23.540 --> 02:57:28.540
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't wish that shit on anybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking evil shit here to keep me from </v>

4072
02:57:28.540 --> 02:57:28.540
<v Speaker 3>killing myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very.</v>

4073
02:57:28.540 --> 02:57:30.020
<v Speaker 3>Clements,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had to talk me down.</v>

4074
02:57:30.630 --> 02:57:33.290
<v Speaker 3>I was going to do the shit that I had </v>
<v Speaker 3>coming out on me.</v>

4075
02:57:33.710 --> 02:57:35.870
<v Speaker 3>You can't even believe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

4076
02:57:36.360 --> 02:57:37.790
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what?</v>

4077
02:57:38.500 --> 02:57:43.500

<v Speaker 3>I'm not fucking getting into all the </v>

4078

<v Speaker 3>publicly.</v>

<v Speaker 3>But if I say barely fucking saved my </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking life.</v>

4080
02:57:45.920 --> 02:57:48.710
<v Speaker 3>He saved you with perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gives you a better perspective.</v>

4081
02:57:48.950 --> 02:57:50.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm lucky I talked to him.</v>

02:57:50.301 --> 02:57:52.670
<v Speaker 3>I am because I was in a fucking bad </v>
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

4083
02:57:52.800 --> 02:57:54.260
<v Speaker 3>When you're ready to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

4084
02:57:54.270 --> 02:57:59.270
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is my ignorance because I thought </v>

4085
02:57:59.270 --> 02:58:00.940
<v Speaker 3>that you were brushing it off like </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing while I was freight.</v>

4086
02:58:01.100 --> 02:58:02.880
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't even podcast about it.</v>

4087
02:58:02.900 --> 02:58:05.100
<v Speaker 3>I heard you talking on a podcast will go</v>
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>

4088
02:58:05.160 --> 02:58:06.240
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4089
02:58:06.270 --> 02:58:11.270
<v Speaker 3>it was a long time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a long time to ways that I couldn't even</v>

4090
02:58:11.461 --> 02:58:12.720
<v Speaker 3>believe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

4091
02:58:12.721 --> 02:58:15.240
<v Speaker 3>And he was becoming maddening and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>it was becoming like,</v>

4092
02:58:15.690 --> 02:58:16.650
<v Speaker 3>it's just crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

4093
02:58:16.920 --> 02:58:18.210
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4094
02:58:18.510 --> 02:58:20.400
<v Speaker 3>I still can't get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had to go through a book.</v>

4095
02:58:20.430 --> 02:58:21.750
<v Speaker 3>Me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be tickled to have an agent.</v>

4096
02:58:21.840 --> 02:58:22.770
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know where they went,</v>

4097
02:58:22.830 --> 02:58:26.580
<v Speaker 3>but it was like I was off the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4098
02:58:26.820 --> 02:58:28.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just had no,</v>

4099
02:58:28.141 --> 02:58:29.040
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know work.</v>

4100
02:58:29.041 --> 02:58:30.570
<v Speaker 3>I had a job lined up that supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get.</v>

4101
02:58:30.630 --> 02:58:32.190
<v Speaker 3>I fucking couldn't.</v>

4102
02:58:34.470 --> 02:58:35.730
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4103
02:58:36.300 --> 02:58:39.030
<v Speaker 3>I would just like taking it to work for </v>
<v Speaker 3>shy anyway because I like my job,</v>

4104
02:58:39.040 --> 02:58:44.040
<v Speaker 3>but it was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't believe the amount of shit </v>

4105
02:58:44.040 --> 02:58:44.670
<v Speaker 3>for something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's controversial,</v>

4106
02:58:45.180 --> 02:58:50.180
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once it's a slow day and somebody picks </v>

4107
02:58:50.180 --> 02:58:51.090
<v Speaker 3>up and grabbed it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe it's a soft target.</v>

4108
02:58:51.091 --> 02:58:56.091
<v Speaker 3>Someone would bring amy into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe that's why do you say </v>

4109
02:58:56.091 --> 02:58:58.440
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's ridiculous because for her,</v>

4110
02:58:58.470 --> 02:59:03.470
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was no show show while the show </v>

4111
02:59:03.470 --> 02:59:04.170
<v Speaker 3>was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You work for this show is done,</v>

4112
02:59:04.200 --> 02:59:06.330
<v Speaker 3>but you hadn't announced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't stop,</v>

4113
02:59:06.540 --> 02:59:07.650
<v Speaker 3>stop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it just happened.</v>

4114
02:59:08.030 --> 02:59:13.030
<v Speaker 3>Show just ended.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So all that time before then you were </v>

4115
02:59:13.030 --> 02:59:13.030
<v Speaker 3>writing for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4116
02:59:13.030 --> 02:59:14.070
<v Speaker 3>why they would connect you to her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy to think you don't.</v>

4117
02:59:14.340 --> 02:59:15.410
<v Speaker 3>What I don't get is why that would be.</v>

4118
02:59:15.560 --> 02:59:20.560
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get why these fucking social jihadis </v>

4119
02:59:20.560 --> 02:59:23.720
<v Speaker 3>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't get why normal people validated </v>

4120
02:59:23.720 --> 02:59:24.280
<v Speaker 3>ever normal people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's outrageous to validate that people.</v>

4121
02:59:24.420 --> 02:59:27.540
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean with the fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anybody fucking uh,</v>

4122
02:59:27.600 --> 02:59:28.340
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can we.</v>

4123
02:59:28.341 --> 02:59:29.520
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This needs to be addressed.</v>

4124
02:59:29.521 --> 02:59:34.521
<v Speaker 3>Amy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will you please take the floor and </v>

4125
02:59:34.521 --> 02:59:34.521
<v Speaker 3>address this adult man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not your child.</v>

4126
02:59:34.521 --> 02:59:38.160
<v Speaker 3>I think they have to do that because </v>
<v Speaker 3>she's thought of as a feminist and she's</v>

4127
02:59:38.161 --> 02:59:41.490
<v Speaker 3>thought of as a powerful woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a guy working for her.</v>

4128
02:59:41.530 --> 02:59:46.530
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what the difference is because </v>

4129
02:59:46.530 --> 02:59:49.980
<v Speaker 3>Jay was talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was talking about to Jay because he's </v>

4130
02:59:49.980 --> 02:59:51.891
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never get any because we sell like I </v>

4131
02:59:51.891 --> 02:59:54.100
<v Speaker 3>was in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm in the jurisdiction of them </v>

4132
02:59:54.100 --> 02:59:54.750
<v Speaker 3>because um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you were on these fucking people</v>

4133
02:59:54.751 --> 02:59:58.170
<v Speaker 3>in this religion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like they believe that's their,</v>

4134
02:59:58.440 --> 03:00:03.440
<v Speaker 3>like you serve at our pleasure and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they get validated whenever someone </v>

4135
03:00:03.601 --> 03:00:05.430
<v Speaker 3>and all these fucking dipshit liberals.</v>

4136
03:00:05.970 --> 03:00:10.970
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I'm a liberal dude or I don't </v>

4137
03:00:10.970 --> 03:00:10.970
<v Speaker 3>know if I'm like the last of a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

4138
03:00:10.970 --> 03:00:12.960
<v Speaker 3>but they all just pandered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

4139
03:00:12.961 --> 03:00:13.740
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's for the best.</v>

4140
03:00:13.741 --> 03:00:15.570
<v Speaker 3>Don't stumble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your brother just,</v>

4141
03:00:15.780 --> 03:00:16.740
<v Speaker 3>you're not sweating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4142
03:00:16.770 --> 03:00:18.930
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>liberals feel the exact same way.</v>

4143
03:00:18.931 --> 03:00:22.410
<v Speaker 3>I don't feel like they're really </v>
<v Speaker 3>liberals anymore because of the far left</v>

4144
03:00:22.590 --> 03:00:27.590
<v Speaker 3>has taken over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this space of what you can and </v>

4145
03:00:27.590 --> 03:00:27.590
<v Speaker 3>can't say to the point where you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

4146
03:00:27.590 --> 03:00:31.610
<v Speaker 3>really on the outs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't get how they don't see trump as </v>

4147
03:00:31.610 --> 03:00:32.490
<v Speaker 3>their guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like at that part baffles me.</v>

4148
03:00:32.840 --> 03:00:37.840
<v Speaker 3>Like how do you even like just the </v>
<v Speaker 3>stench be just based on these small </v>

4149
03:00:37.840 --> 03:00:42.351
<v Speaker 3>hands and pettiness and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I think it's hilarious that as </v>

<v Speaker 3>shame shit on the hands.</v>

4151
03:00:46.650 --> 03:00:51.650
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the most ridiculous body </v>
<v Speaker 3>shamings ever because they're not even </v>

4152
03:00:51.650 --> 03:00:51.650
<v Speaker 3>that small.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I mean they're not like outrageously </v>
<v Speaker 3>small hands,</v>

4154
03:00:53.250 --> 03:00:55.140
<v Speaker 3>so like when they say it over and over </v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

4155
03:00:55.141 --> 03:00:57.780
<v Speaker 3>just to fuck with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Clearly body shaming.</v>

4156
03:00:57.960 --> 03:01:00.130
<v Speaker 3>It's not like you're making fun of his </v>
<v Speaker 3>hair.</v>

4157
03:01:00.220 --> 03:01:02.110

<v Speaker 3>hand.</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's all it is.</v>

4162

<v Speaker 3>can prove a contradiction and be like </v>

03:02:46.841 --> 03:02:47.890
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what in the fuck?</v>

4195
03:02:48.670 --> 03:02:52.150
<v Speaker 3>He's brown hair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

4196
03:02:53.560 --> 03:02:58.560
<v Speaker 3>The whole thing is so ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like he's a brown guy getting </v>

4197
03:02:58.560 --> 03:02:59.560
<v Speaker 3>that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a new thing.</v>

4198
03:02:59.590 --> 03:03:01.780
<v Speaker 3>He's not brown enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not dark enough.</v>

4199
03:03:01.810 --> 03:03:03.460
<v Speaker 3>Not from Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever the fuck it is.</v>

4200
03:03:03.640 --> 03:03:06.040
<v Speaker 3>If you do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't be liberal enough.</v>

4201
03:03:06.250 --> 03:03:09.670
<v Speaker 3>We're going to get to like one state </v>
<v Speaker 3>where some gender fluid,</v>

4202
03:03:09.671 --> 03:03:14.671
<v Speaker 3>transgender like half black </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hermaphrodite,</v>

4203
03:03:15.910 --> 03:03:20.910
<v Speaker 3>but they're not left handed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right handed privileged or the other guy</v>

4204
03:03:23.200 --> 03:03:28.200
<v Speaker 3>brought in my head on race wars who was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like very funny and get on the show and </v>

4205
03:03:28.200 --> 03:03:29.160
<v Speaker 3>like hit the worst philosophy I heard on</v>
<v Speaker 3>gnomes podcast.</v>

4206
03:03:29.620 --> 03:03:34.620
<v Speaker 3>I saw me out of the seller's like some </v>
<v Speaker 3>white male club and it's not the most </v>

4207
03:03:34.620 --> 03:03:35.320
<v Speaker 3>diverse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4208
03:03:35.321 --> 03:03:37.180
<v Speaker 3>like if I had a riding in cars to </v>
<v Speaker 3>comics,</v>

4209
03:03:37.181 --> 03:03:39.580
<v Speaker 3>it would be very diverse because that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>just who you hang out with.</v>

4210
03:03:39.610 --> 03:03:44.610
<v Speaker 3>I think that dude just talks a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says some shit that doesn't make any </v>

4211
03:03:44.610 --> 03:03:47.791
<v Speaker 3>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He went after me and who the fuck was </v>

4212
03:03:47.791 --> 03:03:47.791
<v Speaker 3>it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something he was seeing?</v>

4213
03:03:47.791 --> 03:03:50.770
<v Speaker 3>Very nice conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Totally out of context.</v>

4214
03:03:50.980 --> 03:03:53.190
<v Speaker 3>We were talking about how many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4215
03:03:53.350 --> 03:03:58.350
<v Speaker 3>when kids get molested,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many of those kids become molesters </v>

4216
03:03:58.350 --> 03:03:58.350
<v Speaker 3>and we were trying to figure</v>

4217
03:03:58.350 --> 03:03:59.930
<v Speaker 2>out like that is a real thing that does </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

4218
03:03:59.931 --> 03:04:04.931
<v Speaker 2>Also where you get ingrained somehow or </v>
<v Speaker 2>another into a homosexual being aroused </v>

4219
03:04:06.770 --> 03:04:11.770
<v Speaker 2>homosexual rights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you call it?</v>

4220
03:04:12.950 --> 03:04:15.890
<v Speaker 2>A boner boyfriend know that people get </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

4221
03:04:16.220 --> 03:04:18.160
<v Speaker 2>it's not the same as what you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

4222
03:04:18.161 --> 03:04:21.380
<v Speaker 2>Like young people when young people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>going through their development,</v>

4223
03:04:21.381 --> 03:04:26.381
<v Speaker 2>if they get arrested,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is entirely possible or $300 but not </v>

4224
03:04:26.381 --> 03:04:31.241
<v Speaker 2>even molested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they just have a sexual experience </v>

4225
03:04:31.241 --> 03:04:31.610
<v Speaker 2>with a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe if you can shape somebody's entire</v>

4226
03:04:31.611 --> 03:04:36.611
<v Speaker 2>fucking shit gets printed out that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>said a bunch of tweets about like us </v>

4227
03:04:36.770 --> 03:04:41.770
<v Speaker 2>wondering like two straight guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>wondering how many gay guys became gay </v>

4228
03:04:41.770 --> 03:04:42.320
<v Speaker 2>because they got fucked when they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids.</v>

4229
03:04:42.770 --> 03:04:44.630
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's not what we said,</v>

4230
03:04:44.930 --> 03:04:49.930
<v Speaker 2>but that is a study and I saw it printed</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I copy and pasted the url for an </v>

4231
03:04:51.800 --> 03:04:52.970
<v Speaker 2>actual study on that.</v>

4232
03:04:53.000 --> 03:04:58.000
<v Speaker 2>Like how many times people are molested </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they wind up becoming homosexual or </v>

4233
03:04:59.451 --> 03:05:04.451
<v Speaker 2>becoming a molester themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are two real distinct </v>

4234
03:05:04.451 --> 03:05:06.770
<v Speaker 2>possibilities when you completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>disrupt a child's sexual cycle,</v>

4235
03:05:06.920 --> 03:05:11.920
<v Speaker 2>who's saying it's bad or they're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>making a judgment call a off of your </v>

4236
03:05:11.920 --> 03:05:15.830
<v Speaker 2>desk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's exactly because there's something </v>

4237
03:05:15.830 --> 03:05:18.760
<v Speaker 2>that happens to people when they get </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexually molested and most of it's </v>

4238
03:05:18.760 --> 03:05:20.240
<v Speaker 2>really bad and hypersexuality is another</v>
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

4239
03:05:20.241 --> 03:05:22.340
<v Speaker 2>People become very sexual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of weird,</v>

4240
03:05:22.400 --> 03:05:27.290
<v Speaker 2>so we weren't in any way saying that gay</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are only gay because of that.</v>

4241
03:05:27.330 --> 03:05:30.620
<v Speaker 2>I wonder is it all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been studied by scientists,</v>

4242
03:05:31.030 --> 03:05:36.030
<v Speaker 2>the shit about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just as good as name attached to </v>

4243
03:05:36.030 --> 03:05:36.030
<v Speaker 2>get it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's why the seller thing,</v>

4244
03:05:36.030 --> 03:05:38.300
<v Speaker 2>but I gladly would have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mom makes me.</v>

4245
03:05:38.301 --> 03:05:41.720
<v Speaker 2>It makes me more careful with what I say</v>
<v Speaker 2>though and I think that's the good thing</v>

4246
03:05:41.721 --> 03:05:46.721
<v Speaker 2>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to leave it in the past had been way </v>

4247
03:05:46.721 --> 03:05:46.721
<v Speaker 2>more careless with how I say thanks.</v>

4248
03:05:46.820 --> 03:05:49.190
<v Speaker 2>To think that it wouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 2>misconstrued,</v>

4249
03:05:49.191 --> 03:05:54.191
<v Speaker 2>especially not weaponized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well due to apologies are not to the </v>

4250
03:05:54.191 --> 03:05:56.090
<v Speaker 2>people that hate you because they want </v>
<v Speaker 2>you dead and there's no.</v>

4251
03:05:56.390 --> 03:06:00.140
<v Speaker 2>It's for people that like you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand.</v>

4252
03:06:00.380 --> 03:06:05.380
<v Speaker 2>That's what you apologized for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The people that are against you or </v>

4253
03:06:05.380 --> 03:06:06.260
<v Speaker 2>they're not comedy fans are learning </v>
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>

4254
03:06:06.261 --> 03:06:11.261
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So through this whole dark journey that </v>

4255
03:06:11.261 --> 03:06:11.300
<v Speaker 2>you went on with all this bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you did learn that though.</v>

4256
03:06:11.480 --> 03:06:13.430
<v Speaker 2>So it's very valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4257
03:06:13.431 --> 03:06:15.380
<v Speaker 2>No dues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Barry Barry is very helpful to me.</v>

4258
03:06:15.381 --> 03:06:20.381
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you going through all this and </v>

4259
03:06:20.381 --> 03:06:21.110
<v Speaker 2>coming out on the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the experience of doing it.</v>

4260
03:06:21.290 --> 03:06:21.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

4261
03:06:22.420 --> 03:06:27.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>made a lot of things that I kinda was </v>

4262
03:06:27.420 --> 03:06:27.560
<v Speaker 2>told earlier that never made sense to </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

4263
03:06:27.561 --> 03:06:30.710
<v Speaker 2>Make a lot of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember last time we hung out Patrice</v>

4264
03:06:30.710 --> 03:06:35.710
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said to me that I didn't understand </v>

4265
03:06:35.710 --> 03:06:37.901
<v Speaker 2>the magnitude of what he was saying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>me until then how so like what kind of </v>

4266
03:06:37.901 --> 03:06:39.830
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just know what a devil businesses is and</v>

4267
03:06:39.831 --> 03:06:42.110
<v Speaker 2>how easy you get fooled into the brass </v>
<v Speaker 2>ring.</v>

4268
03:06:42.111 --> 03:06:44.660
<v Speaker 2>It makes you a coward when they give you</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff to,</v>

4269
03:06:44.720 --> 03:06:47.000
<v Speaker 2>to let you know that that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But here's the thing,</v>

4270
03:06:47.060 --> 03:06:50.090
<v Speaker 2>I think that's less the case now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is my case,</v>

4271
03:06:50.240 --> 03:06:55.240
<v Speaker 2>I think because of the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think comics essentially have created </v>

4272
03:06:55.240 --> 03:06:55.750
<v Speaker 2>a network of each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly right.</v>

4273
03:06:55.830 --> 03:06:59.970
<v Speaker 2>Think of the network of race wars or </v>
<v Speaker 2>skeptic tank or family.</v>

4274
03:06:59.971 --> 03:07:02.700
<v Speaker 2>Our Joey Diaz is a church of what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening now.</v>

4275
03:07:03.330 --> 03:07:04.860
<v Speaker 2>We're all in a network together.</v>

4276
03:07:05.190 --> 03:07:05.580
<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

4277
03:07:05.581 --> 03:07:10.581
<v Speaker 4>I learned a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The main thing is that because I only </v>

4278
03:07:10.581 --> 03:07:11.170
<v Speaker 4>really got work in his business because </v>
<v Speaker 4>of comics,</v>

4279
03:07:11.171 --> 03:07:11.670
<v Speaker 4>there was not the</v>

4280
03:07:11.880 --> 03:07:15.890
<v Speaker 2>history now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really important,</v>

4281
03:07:15.891 --> 03:07:18.290
<v Speaker 2>more so than ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can filter down thing,</v>

4282
03:07:18.460 --> 03:07:23.460
<v Speaker 2>but the network is an organic network.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead of someone owning you or having </v>

4283
03:07:23.460 --> 03:07:24.030
<v Speaker 2>a contract with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>

4284
03:07:24.110 --> 03:07:24.820
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

4285
03:07:24.830 --> 03:07:26.480
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be like,</v>

4286
03:07:26.481 --> 03:07:27.620
<v Speaker 2>go see him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4287
03:07:27.670 --> 03:07:29.240
<v Speaker 2>Gertz hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go see him,</v>

4288
03:07:29.390 --> 03:07:30.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make us.</v>

4289
03:07:30.770 --> 03:07:35.770
<v Speaker 2>And so then people listen to your </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast or to listen to your specialty </v>

4290
03:07:35.770 --> 03:07:35.770
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4291
03:07:35.770 --> 03:07:39.851
<v Speaker 2>this guy's fucking hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we've told them the truth so many </v>

4292
03:07:39.851 --> 03:07:43.151
<v Speaker 2>times that they believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the other thing about podcasts </v>

4293
03:07:43.151 --> 03:07:46.541
<v Speaker 2>that I think is amazing and then just </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Internet in general with comics </v>

4294
03:07:46.541 --> 03:07:49.301
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it everybody supportive of each </v>

4295
03:07:49.301 --> 03:07:49.301
<v Speaker 2>other?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When someone has a special coming out,</v>

4296
03:07:49.301 --> 03:07:50.270
<v Speaker 2>I see other people tweeting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go check this out.</v>

4297
03:07:50.820 --> 03:07:53.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the time was great about that.</v>

4298
03:07:53.871 --> 03:07:55.370
<v Speaker 2>So it was Ari,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but these people are,</v>

4299
03:07:55.371 --> 03:07:57.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody ever did that in the past.</v>

4300
03:07:58.570 --> 03:08:01.930
<v Speaker 4>I feel like if I like somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>should I go out of my way to compliment</v>

4301
03:08:02.400 --> 03:08:04.990
<v Speaker 2>out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like bitcoin.</v>

4302
03:08:05.050 --> 03:08:07.360
<v Speaker 2>It's a decentralized currency now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A little bit.</v>

4303
03:08:07.380 --> 03:08:08.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a little bit.</v>

4304
03:08:08.321 --> 03:08:13.321
<v Speaker 2>And there's less of this golden ring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that golden ring is just fucking </v>

4305
03:08:13.321 --> 03:08:13.321
<v Speaker 2>acting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4306
03:08:13.321 --> 03:08:15.460
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was not acting.</v>

4307
03:08:15.461 --> 03:08:20.461
<v Speaker 2>It's writing about acting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like reading the scripts about </v>

4308
03:08:20.461 --> 03:08:21.340
<v Speaker 2>complaints or casting complaints.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Stand up.</v>

4309
03:08:21.350 --> 03:08:22.600
<v Speaker 2>Complaints.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Our world,</v>

4310
03:08:22.601 --> 03:08:24.400
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is we fuck up.</v>

4311
03:08:24.480 --> 03:08:27.340
<v Speaker 2>We go to that world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our world is inappropriate.</v>

4312
03:08:27.341 --> 03:08:29.800
<v Speaker 2>Shit said behind closed doors making </v>
<v Speaker 2>each other laugh.</v>

4313
03:08:29.801 --> 03:08:32.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Terrible class.</v>

4314
03:08:32.470 --> 03:08:34.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm not here to help the class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>

4315
03:08:34.460 --> 03:08:37.090
<v Speaker 2>we're in the green room doing mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>smoking pot,</v>

4316
03:08:37.360 --> 03:08:42.360
<v Speaker 2>drinking whiskey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then we go on stage and talk crazy </v>

4317
03:08:42.360 --> 03:08:42.580
<v Speaker 2>shit because this is our world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our world is not the casting couch.</v>

4318
03:08:42.700 --> 03:08:47.700
<v Speaker 2>Our world is nothing to do with </v>
<v Speaker 2>auditions or this whole fucking acting </v>

4319
03:08:48.640 --> 03:08:52.090
<v Speaker 2>like the way actors talk to each other </v>
<v Speaker 2>and actor speak.</v>

4320
03:08:52.210 --> 03:08:53.460
<v Speaker 2>That's not our world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

4321
03:08:53.650 --> 03:08:55.090
<v Speaker 2>We're not doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not.</v>

4322
03:08:55.300 --> 03:08:56.190
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is it.</v>

4323
03:08:56.210 --> 03:08:59.590
<v Speaker 2>It's a different world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're trying to come up with shit.</v>

4324
03:08:59.591 --> 03:09:02.560
<v Speaker 2>That's funny so that people laugh </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we liked that</v>

4325
03:09:02.740 --> 03:09:07.740
<v Speaker 4>because I believe the last thing is </v>
<v Speaker 4>barry said to me because they wanted to </v>

4326
03:09:07.740 --> 03:09:10.021
<v Speaker 4>take his special awful Louis site,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which you wouldn't do because Barry's </v>

4327
03:09:10.021 --> 03:09:11.920
<v Speaker 4>like a stand up dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't like go with the crowds.</v>

4328
03:09:11.921 --> 03:09:13.190
<v Speaker 4>Trendy horseshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like He.</v>

4329
03:09:13.191 --> 03:09:15.040
<v Speaker 4>He had principles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's like,</v>

4330
03:09:15.041 --> 03:09:20.041
<v Speaker 4>I'm so sick of the untalented hijacking </v>
<v Speaker 4>of very real trauma to a lot of people </v>

4331
03:09:20.141 --> 03:09:23.080
<v Speaker 4>to further their dump Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's dead on about that.</v>

4332
03:09:23.440 --> 03:09:25.540
<v Speaker 4>It's people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like people.</v>

4333
03:09:25.570 --> 03:09:26.680
<v Speaker 4>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>

4334
03:09:27.300 --> 03:09:29.740
<v Speaker 4>the stats when they go one in five </v>
<v Speaker 4>people are rapes.</v>

4335
03:09:29.741 --> 03:09:31.030
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or women are raped.</v>

4336
03:09:31.390 --> 03:09:34.330
<v Speaker 4>I think that's probably just the amount </v>
<v Speaker 4>of men that are raped and women could be</v>

4337
03:09:34.331 --> 03:09:35.350
<v Speaker 4>double that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

4338
03:09:35.351 --> 03:09:40.351
<v Speaker 4>I think it's so prevalent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but just based on the people I know in </v>

4339
03:09:40.351 --> 03:09:40.351
<v Speaker 4>my life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

4340
03:09:40.351 --> 03:09:44.491
<v Speaker 4>That's something happened to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's weird for something not to what </v>

4341
03:09:44.491 --> 03:09:44.491
<v Speaker 4>happen to you.</v>

4342
03:09:44.491 --> 03:09:47.040
<v Speaker 2>You see what Tim Dillon wrote about all </v>
<v Speaker 2>this after the whole Louis thing.</v>

4343
03:09:47.200 --> 03:09:51.570
<v Speaker 2>When Tim Dillon wrote a brilliant piece,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he wrote it on facebook,</v>

4344
03:09:51.810 --> 03:09:54.370
<v Speaker 2>but then he put it on instagram and </v>
<v Speaker 2>broke it up into pages</v>

4345
03:09:54.370 --> 03:09:59.370
<v Speaker 1>so that you can keep turning through it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's explaining how this is an </v>

4346
03:09:59.370 --> 03:10:02.191
<v Speaker 1>opportunity for truly mediocre talent to</v>
<v Speaker 1>chop down someone who was head and </v>

4347
03:10:02.191 --> 03:10:06.961
<v Speaker 1>shoulders far better than that and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>do so by claiming the moral high ground </v>

4348
03:10:06.961 --> 03:10:11.640
<v Speaker 1>by virtue signaling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by like going after him and attacking </v>

4349
03:10:11.640 --> 03:10:11.640
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>breaking down what he did.</v>

4350
03:10:11.650 --> 03:10:13.980
<v Speaker 1>Or you can tell people's character by </v>
<v Speaker 1>who wanted to get there.</v>

4351
03:10:13.981 --> 03:10:17.620
<v Speaker 1>A little kick in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same thing happen to me it was.</v>

4352
03:10:17.680 --> 03:10:19.210
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like I'm not.</v>

4355
03:10:21.880 --> 03:10:26.880
<v Speaker 1>I lost respect for a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>during this whole thing and I'll tell </v>
