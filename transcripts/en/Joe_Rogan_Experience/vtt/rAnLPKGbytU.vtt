00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.710
<v Speaker 1>Chilson and non coffee enthusiasts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Coffee,</v>

2
00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:08.563
<v Speaker 1>coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>noninclusive.</v>

3
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.610
<v Speaker 2>Well I drink it every day and I like</v>
<v Speaker 2>coffee,</v>

4
00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:13.200
<v Speaker 2>but I've got a doctorate a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5
00:00:13.201 --> 00:00:15.470
<v Speaker 2>I've gotten copy mates and the hazel</v>
<v Speaker 2>nuts.</v>

6
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:16.333
<v Speaker 2>I've got to do all that stuff.</v>

7
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:18.030
<v Speaker 1>Uses Jazz Stevia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

8
00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.420
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but may I is good.</v>

9
00:00:19.421 --> 00:00:20.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please.</v>

10
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.590
<v Speaker 1>It's stronger than sugar so don't put it</v>
<v Speaker 1>in like you would do sugar,</v>

11
00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:28.000
<v Speaker 1>but it's a completely natural available</v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>

12
00:00:28.001 --> 00:00:31.180
<v Speaker 1>All sorts of health food stores and</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole foods carries it.</v>

13
00:00:31.181 --> 00:00:33.700
<v Speaker 1>It's a uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a plant based sweetener.</v>

14
00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.620
<v Speaker 1>Not Sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Bad for you then give you the DAB.</v>

15
00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.590
<v Speaker 1>This doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

16
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.100
<v Speaker 1>doesn't fuck with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like aspartame does.</v>

17
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.960
<v Speaker 1>Some people don't like the taste of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I like it.</v>

18
00:00:43.961 --> 00:00:47.590
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that I can get away with it</v>
<v Speaker 1>where I can drink and I know there's no</v>

19
00:00:47.591 --> 00:00:48.940
<v Speaker 1>sugar at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like it a lot.</v>

20
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.850
<v Speaker 2>Are they a sponsor?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We do an a plug right now.</v>

21
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could say I know about safe sex.</v>

22
00:00:54.901 --> 00:00:59.160
<v Speaker 2>We don't even sell it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm a fan of it.</v>

23
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.260
<v Speaker 2>So here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's my theory on coffee and I think</v>

24
00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:04.620
<v Speaker 2>this is true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If if coffee wasn't around and I</v>

25
00:01:04.621 --> 00:01:08.800
<v Speaker 2>discovered it and I sat you and Jamie</v>
<v Speaker 2>down and I slid a cup across the tape</v>

26
00:01:08.801 --> 00:01:10.920
<v Speaker 2>and go try this guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want,</v>

27
00:01:10.921 --> 00:01:13.800
<v Speaker 2>I want $50,000 from both of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to build this coffee.</v>

28
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.330
<v Speaker 2>Taste this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd go,</v>

29
00:01:15.331 --> 00:01:17.400
<v Speaker 2>you're out of your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to give me a dollar?</v>

30
00:01:17.401 --> 00:01:17.761
<v Speaker 2>They'd go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

31
00:01:17.761 --> 00:01:17.910
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

32
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:18.960
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not only,</v>

33
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.570
<v Speaker 2>not only am I going to sell this for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>profit,</v>

34
00:01:21.571 --> 00:01:24.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to put sprinkles in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to put it in a fancy cup.</v>

35
00:01:24.301 --> 00:01:24.811
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna.</v>

36
00:01:24.811 --> 00:01:26.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mix whipped cream on top and sell it at</v>

37
00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.190
<v Speaker 2>300 percent profit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could just get out</v>

38
00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.600
<v Speaker 1>and tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well maybe,</v>

39
00:01:31.601 --> 00:01:35.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean a very small niche market maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

40
00:01:35.081 --> 00:01:36.400
<v Speaker 1>it's not like it's going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>

41
00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:37.430
<v Speaker 1>It's not bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

42
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.070
<v Speaker 1>That Stevia is good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not bad.</v>

43
00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.170
<v Speaker 1>It's Kinda like a little bit of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitterness to it.</v>

44
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.950
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't taste as good as sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for me it's a good compromise</v>

45
00:01:44.951 --> 00:01:47.140
<v Speaker 1>knowing that there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing negative about it,</v>

46
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.620
<v Speaker 2>but I'm going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is how you start your show.</v>

47
00:01:50.621 --> 00:01:51.970
<v Speaker 2>I like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No Big Internet.</v>

48
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.550
<v Speaker 2>You just turned it on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not necessarily share the man.</v>

49
00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.160
<v Speaker 2>No one else could pull that off really</v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

50
00:01:57.161 --> 00:02:00.190
<v Speaker 2>They just need to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you just didn't worry,</v>

51
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.750
<v Speaker 2>if everybody just didn't worry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would just do it this way.</v>

52
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.440
<v Speaker 2>I suppose you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So whatever we talk about today is,</v>

53
00:02:05.441 --> 00:02:09.010
<v Speaker 2>there is nothing going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

54
00:02:09.011 --> 00:02:11.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean it just seems like it's just</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing happening.</v>

55
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.880
<v Speaker 2>It's just an average Monday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple of coffee drinkers here.</v>

56
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.433
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

57
00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:18.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're all trying to figure out if</v>

58
00:02:18.881 --> 00:02:19.950
<v Speaker 2>they're going to sell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sell or not.</v>

59
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.180
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm on the other side of the fence</v>

60
00:02:22.181 --> 00:02:23.470
<v Speaker 2>from a lot of the reports.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going,</v>

61
00:02:23.471 --> 00:02:24.161
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope so.</v>

62
00:02:24.161 --> 00:02:25.210
<v Speaker 2>What a cool thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

63
00:02:25.211 --> 00:02:27.140
<v Speaker 2>they can sell the work they put in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>risks.</v>

64
00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.350
<v Speaker 2>They built this interest in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The ultimate thing you want to do with</v>

65
00:02:29.351 --> 00:02:31.750
<v Speaker 2>the business day one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you sit down to start a business,</v>

66
00:02:31.751 --> 00:02:33.880
<v Speaker 2>you want to create something so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody else wants to buy it,</v>

67
00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.940
<v Speaker 2>so I'm on the other side of the fence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of these reports were coming out</v>

68
00:02:36.941 --> 00:02:38.620
<v Speaker 2>like this was going to be earth</v>
<v Speaker 2>shattering news.</v>

69
00:02:38.621 --> 00:02:39.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is going to be great.</v>

70
00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.940
<v Speaker 2>This is if you like them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they've done something for you and</v>

71
00:02:42.941 --> 00:02:45.190
<v Speaker 2>you're cheering for him than cheer that</v>
<v Speaker 2>this goes through.</v>

72
00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.800
<v Speaker 2>Particularly if you retain Dane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that was the other part of the</v>

73
00:02:47.801 --> 00:02:49.570
<v Speaker 2>report was that Dane was gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stay on.</v>

74
00:02:49.571 --> 00:02:50.470
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's relevant.</v>

75
00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.200
<v Speaker 2>There's not another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not another guy alive that can</v>

76
00:02:53.201 --> 00:02:56.920
<v Speaker 2>run that and that's not some nice</v>
<v Speaker 2>statement to Damon Damon.</v>

77
00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.440
<v Speaker 2>That's just the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you can't go to a library and check</v>

78
00:02:59.441 --> 00:03:00.040
<v Speaker 2>out a book on</v>

79
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.620
<v Speaker 3>fight promotion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't go to any college and major in</v>

80
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.720
<v Speaker 1>promotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You either know it or you don't.</v>

81
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:05.151
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

82
00:03:05.151 --> 00:03:10.151
<v Speaker 1>It's difficult and it requires all day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Dana's working all day,</v>

83
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.840
<v Speaker 1>like people for people that don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll call him at like 1:00 in the</v>

84
00:03:13.841 --> 00:03:17.380
<v Speaker 1>morning and he just got off the phone</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's doing deals and he's making</v>

85
00:03:17.381 --> 00:03:19.660
<v Speaker 1>things happen and he's trying and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>obsessed with it.</v>

86
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean I got really does love the</v>
<v Speaker 1>business of putting together fights.</v>

87
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:24.720
<v Speaker 1>We will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

88
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.060
<v Speaker 1>we'll talk randomly just in the middle</v>
<v Speaker 1>of nowhere about fights for hours.</v>

89
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:33.070
<v Speaker 1>He just loves to talk fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He really is a big fan and obsessed and</v>

90
00:03:33.071 --> 00:03:36.280
<v Speaker 1>not burnt out yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is amazing because the amount of</v>

91
00:03:36.281 --> 00:03:40.240
<v Speaker 1>hours that guy puts in and obviously</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's making a shitload of fucking money,</v>

92
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.510
<v Speaker 1>but it's still the amount of hours that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he puts in.</v>

93
00:03:43.511 --> 00:03:45.130
<v Speaker 1>You would think he would be cooked by</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

94
00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:46.043
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would.</v>

95
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.390
<v Speaker 3>And I know what you mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One am is a good time to get ahold of</v>

96
00:03:48.391 --> 00:03:49.530
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in Brazil.</v>

97
00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.350
<v Speaker 3>He called and woke me up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was doing the ultimate fighter.</v>

98
00:03:52.351 --> 00:03:56.400
<v Speaker 3>He walked me as 4:00 AM and I grabbed</v>
<v Speaker 3>the phone and he was talking business</v>

99
00:03:56.401 --> 00:03:58.110
<v Speaker 3>right away and I just said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dane,</v>

100
00:03:58.111 --> 00:03:59.670
<v Speaker 3>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not here.</v>

101
00:03:59.671 --> 00:04:01.680
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And whatever I agreed to right now,</v>

102
00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:03.750
<v Speaker 3>I get a pass because if you give them</v>
<v Speaker 3>your word,</v>

103
00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.651
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

104
00:04:04.651 --> 00:04:07.410
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever I agree to does not see I'm out</v>

105
00:04:07.411 --> 00:04:08.590
<v Speaker 3>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's 4:00 AM.</v>

106
00:04:08.591 --> 00:04:09.331
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh man,</v>

107
00:04:09.331 --> 00:04:10.800
<v Speaker 3>it's 4:00 AM.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

108
00:04:10.801 --> 00:04:11.634
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

109
00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.260
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was only two.</v>

110
00:04:13.261 --> 00:04:16.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm really sorry for calling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he was,</v>

111
00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.840
<v Speaker 3>he was serious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was serious.</v>

112
00:04:18.841 --> 00:04:20.280
<v Speaker 3>And so it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

113
00:04:20.281 --> 00:04:20.881
<v Speaker 3>I get it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

114
00:04:20.881 --> 00:04:22.740

<v Speaker 3>And it was the office line,</v>

115
00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.620
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't his cell line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was at the office and I'm going,</v>

116
00:04:25.621 --> 00:04:26.580
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well look,</v>

117
00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.220
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to work for him in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brazil,</v>

118
00:04:29.221 --> 00:04:31.590
<v Speaker 3>what time is that in America?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's got to be 10.</v>

119
00:04:31.591 --> 00:04:32.690
<v Speaker 3>They're not that far ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where are they?</v>

120
00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.890
<v Speaker 3>They're there for six hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in Sao Paulo,</v>

121
00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.480
<v Speaker 3>so it was still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

122
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:37.980
<v Speaker 3>he's in there grinding.</v>

123
00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.840
<v Speaker 1>That was a ballsy move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you to do the ultimate fighter in</v>

124
00:04:41.841 --> 00:04:46.841
<v Speaker 1>Brazil after you had talked mad shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>about virtually every legend that ever</v>

125
00:04:49.701 --> 00:04:50.534
<v Speaker 1>came out of.</v>

126
00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And to understand.</v>

127
00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.690
<v Speaker 3>Thank you for saying it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's also relevant to understand how</v>

128
00:04:56.691 --> 00:04:59.480
<v Speaker 3>big MMA is over there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get away with that here and there's</v>

129
00:04:59.481 --> 00:05:01.700
<v Speaker 3>gonna be some pockets that know exactly</v>
<v Speaker 3>who you are,</v>

130
00:05:01.701 --> 00:05:04.790
<v Speaker 3>but it's going to be just that pockets</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Brazil.</v>

131
00:05:04.791 --> 00:05:08.630
<v Speaker 3>It's the number two sport behind soccer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody knows.</v>

132
00:05:08.631 --> 00:05:11.120
<v Speaker 3>And I had a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had armed security.</v>

133
00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.420
<v Speaker 3>We went everywhere in bulletproof cars</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

134
00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:19.600
<v Speaker 3>and one night I'm the guns came out and</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever bravado you think you have or</v>

135
00:05:20.961 --> 00:05:24.830
<v Speaker 3>you think you will have when the guns</v>
<v Speaker 3>come out,</v>

136
00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.980
<v Speaker 3>you find out it's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're scared.</v>

137
00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.820
<v Speaker 3>What happened there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is an actual move,</v>

138
00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.460
<v Speaker 3>like there's a name for this and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>very common in Brazil,</v>

139
00:05:34.461 --> 00:05:38.120
<v Speaker 3>but we were going to traffic and a guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>cut in front of us and then what they'd</v>

140
00:05:38.121 --> 00:05:40.540
<v Speaker 3>like to do is cut in front of you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>slow down and they get boxed in.</v>

141
00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.170
<v Speaker 3>They jump out and rob you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when the guy swerved out,</v>

142
00:05:43.171 --> 00:05:44.330
<v Speaker 3>we're in three lanes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>traffic.</v>

143
00:05:44.331 --> 00:05:46.910
<v Speaker 3>There was nobody else on the road.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when the guy cut in front of us,</v>

144
00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.400
<v Speaker 3>security knew right was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They pulled their gun out,</v>

145
00:05:49.401 --> 00:05:52.070
<v Speaker 3>my wife was in the back and she was</v>
<v Speaker 3>sleeping.</v>

146
00:05:52.071 --> 00:05:55.680
<v Speaker 3>She was laying down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she had her feet across me and uh,</v>

147
00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.150
<v Speaker 3>I woke her and I said</v>

148
00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:02.600
<v Speaker 4>he got his gun and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was an exit right up and the guy</v>

149
00:06:02.601 --> 00:06:04.430
<v Speaker 4>swerved over as quick as he cut in front</v>
<v Speaker 4>of us,</v>

150
00:06:04.431 --> 00:06:06.380
<v Speaker 4>took the exit was gone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nothing happened at all.</v>

151
00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:11.510
<v Speaker 4>But in that moment you find out when the</v>
<v Speaker 4>guns come out,</v>

152
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.470
<v Speaker 4>what ever macho is you think you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to have in that situation?</v>

153
00:06:15.471 --> 00:06:17.240
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>were you think in like,</v>

154
00:06:17.241 --> 00:06:19.520
<v Speaker 4>why did I talk all that Shit I've just</v>
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>

155
00:06:19.521 --> 00:06:22.550
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had no way to know I was in the car.</v>

156
00:06:22.551 --> 00:06:24.430
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they were just getting ready or</v>

157
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.090
<v Speaker 4>at least the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the security thought they were just</v>

158
00:06:26.091 --> 00:06:27.320
<v Speaker 4>getting ready to rob us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

159
00:06:27.321 --> 00:06:28.700
<v Speaker 4>it had.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But yeah.</v>

160
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:30.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did.</v>

161
00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.700
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's true.</v>

162
00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.570
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's true.</v>

163
00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:35.990
<v Speaker 4>Getting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can nobody here take a joke,</v>

164
00:06:35.991 --> 00:06:39.740
<v Speaker 4>am my job,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but ended up being a great time.</v>

165
00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.000
<v Speaker 4>It ended up being a really great time.</v>

166
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.530
<v Speaker 4>The ultimate fighter just isn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>generally.</v>

167
00:06:42.531 --> 00:06:46.370
<v Speaker 4>I had the opportunity to have them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you build lifelong relationships.</v>

168
00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:47.900
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you stay friends with those guys.</v>

169
00:06:47.901 --> 00:06:51.710
<v Speaker 4>You watch them being vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You watch them putting their whole life,</v>

170
00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:54.800
<v Speaker 4>everything into it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These get leaving their families.</v>

171
00:06:54.801 --> 00:06:57.200
<v Speaker 4>The first ultimate fighter I did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we had two holidays.</v>

172
00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:59.770
<v Speaker 4>I'm counting thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A Halloween is when I realized that</v>

173
00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.970
<v Speaker 4>isn't a holiday,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you have kids that's a big day.</v>

174
00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:04.460
<v Speaker 4>Skies leave their kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't get to see them dress up and</v>

175
00:07:04.461 --> 00:07:07.160
<v Speaker 4>then we had thanksgiving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't even get a call home.</v>

176
00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:09.560
<v Speaker 4>One guy had the birth of his first</v>
<v Speaker 4>child.</v>

177
00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.010
<v Speaker 4>He did not get to call in and check on</v>
<v Speaker 4>his wife.</v>

178
00:07:13.011 --> 00:07:14.570
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a big deal.</v>

179
00:07:14.571 --> 00:07:17.770
<v Speaker 4>What goes on and they are very strict.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know why they are joe.</v>

180
00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:20.330
<v Speaker 4>I realized that for reality TV that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

181
00:07:20.331 --> 00:07:22.430
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that turmoil is build something,</v>

182
00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:24.590
<v Speaker 4>but I'm kind of looking at going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>

183
00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:27.350
<v Speaker 4>Let's do this little nine to five deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Send them home,</v>

184
00:07:27.351 --> 00:07:30.230
<v Speaker 4>give them their cell phones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let these guys just be regular guys.</v>

185
00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.010
<v Speaker 4>People talk too much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They tell too many secrets.</v>

186
00:07:34.011 --> 00:07:36.280
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they explain what's going on to talk to</v>

187
00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:39.260
<v Speaker 4>press.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They give inside scoops and will only be</v>

188
00:07:39.261 --> 00:07:40.170
<v Speaker 4>revealed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

189
00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.950
<v Speaker 4>I promise you this won't be revealed</v>
<v Speaker 4>until the show goes to air.</v>

190
00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.170
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of fuckery that goes on</v>
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>

191
00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:48.310
<v Speaker 4>with people that are on reality shows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what they're trying to overlay.</v>

192
00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:51.170
<v Speaker 4>A funny word fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's one of my favorite words.</v>

193
00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:53.120
<v Speaker 4>Great words,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

194
00:07:53.121 --> 00:07:56.480
<v Speaker 4>there's truth to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you are your appearance on the</v>

195
00:07:56.481 --> 00:08:00.770
<v Speaker 4>ultimate fighter in Brazil with vangely</v>
<v Speaker 4>to it sort of changed like vandalize</v>

196
00:08:00.771 --> 00:08:04.820
<v Speaker 4>public opinion right now is very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very high.</v>

197
00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:07.100
<v Speaker 4>Like people like him again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and one of the reasons why they like him</v>

198
00:08:07.101 --> 00:08:09.650
<v Speaker 4>is because he got fucked over by the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nevada state athletic commission,</v>

199
00:08:09.651 --> 00:08:10.484
<v Speaker 4>hardcore.</v>

200
00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.950
<v Speaker 4>They banned him for life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for missing a drug test,</v>

201
00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:17.420
<v Speaker 4>which I just think is fucking tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's straight bullshit.</v>

202
00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:21.170
<v Speaker 4>I think that that is a fucking horrible</v>
<v Speaker 4>miscarriage of justice.</v>

203
00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.120
<v Speaker 4>If you think the guy was doing</v>
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>

204
00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:25.340
<v Speaker 4>then you find him and you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

205
00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:29.450
<v Speaker 4>you banned him for the amount of time</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you need to based on if he was</v>

206
00:08:29.451 --> 00:08:30.440
<v Speaker 4>guilty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

207
00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:33.270
<v Speaker 4>You don't get to do life that's fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy to do,</v>

208
00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:37.880
<v Speaker 4>to be so callous to show that you are a</v>
<v Speaker 4>governing body and that you are taking</v>

209
00:08:37.881 --> 00:08:41.540
<v Speaker 4>care of the future of these athletes and</v>
<v Speaker 4>supposedly protecting them from other</v>

210
00:08:41.541 --> 00:08:45.320
<v Speaker 4>athletes that are cheating or from from</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever other nonsense,</v>

211
00:08:45.321 --> 00:08:47.660
<v Speaker 4>whatever other illegal activity might be</v>
<v Speaker 4>going on,</v>

212
00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:52.960
<v Speaker 4>and to take that position of power and</v>
<v Speaker 4>into flagrantly abuse it in that way</v>

213
00:08:53.721 --> 00:08:54.740
<v Speaker 4>where you're just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

214
00:08:54.741 --> 00:08:56.190
<v Speaker 4>you're openly showing</v>

215
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:58.380
<v Speaker 3>them that you don't give a fuck about</v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

216
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.780
<v Speaker 3>You don't care about their career,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't care that this is the only way</v>

217
00:09:00.781 --> 00:09:03.750
<v Speaker 3>they have to make a living and you just</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to ban them for life because they</v>

218
00:09:03.751 --> 00:09:05.730
<v Speaker 3>missed a drug test.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let me,</v>

219
00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.350
<v Speaker 3>let me give you another side of this</v>
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

220
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:11.160
<v Speaker 3>Vandelay never told his side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vandelay got pissed and he yelled and he</v>

221
00:09:11.161 --> 00:09:12.390
<v Speaker 3>went to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>created all of these things,</v>

222
00:09:12.391 --> 00:09:14.910
<v Speaker 3>but he never just sat down and told his</v>
<v Speaker 3>side calmly.</v>

223
00:09:14.911 --> 00:09:17.910
<v Speaker 3>So here's vandelay side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and when you hear this,</v>

224
00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:20.790
<v Speaker 3>you're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to side with vandelay.</v>

225
00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:24.120
<v Speaker 3>Here's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was the first guy ever tested,</v>

226
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.360
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this random out of competition</v>

227
00:09:27.361 --> 00:09:28.920
<v Speaker 3>testing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so none of us knew what it was.</v>

228
00:09:28.921 --> 00:09:32.490
<v Speaker 3>And you have to take that time into</v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective because now guys understand,</v>

229
00:09:32.491 --> 00:09:33.660
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get a knock on the door,</v>

230
00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:35.580
<v Speaker 3>you must,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you must comply.</v>

231
00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.880
<v Speaker 3>But I was the first one ever took,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd never heard of this guy shows up.</v>

232
00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:41.570
<v Speaker 3>Vandelay was to be the second one</v>
<v Speaker 3>tested,</v>

233
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:42.810
<v Speaker 3>but did it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did it test.</v>

234
00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:46.290
<v Speaker 3>In hindsight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I shouldn't have tested.</v>

235
00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.090
<v Speaker 3>I'm not even sure they were within their</v>
<v Speaker 3>rights.</v>

236
00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:51.000
<v Speaker 3>And this is relevant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They show up.</v>

237
00:09:51.001 --> 00:09:54.690
<v Speaker 3>The guy has no id,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely no identification of who he</v>

238
00:09:54.691 --> 00:09:57.660
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a problem to start with</v>

239
00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:58.980
<v Speaker 3>you then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a huge.</v>

240
00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:03.780
<v Speaker 3>He then wants to take me into a back</v>
<v Speaker 3>room which ended up being a janitor's</v>

241
00:10:03.781 --> 00:10:05.010
<v Speaker 3>closet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not sanitary,</v>

242
00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:09.480
<v Speaker 3>a backroom at the MGM grand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He takes me in there where I must</v>

243
00:10:09.481 --> 00:10:11.960
<v Speaker 3>disrobe and present to him my penis</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he,</v>

244
00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:13.220
<v Speaker 3>w he watches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

245
00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:15.580
<v Speaker 3>that's a very private thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the ID,</v>

246
00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:18.570
<v Speaker 3>he wants to see your dad and if there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>a look and they need to.</v>

247
00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:21.690
<v Speaker 3>I understand now and I think a lot more</v>
<v Speaker 3>of us do to that you're going to have to</v>

248
00:10:21.691 --> 00:10:23.130
<v Speaker 3>get naked and do this so you get wisdom.</v>

249
00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:26.010
<v Speaker 3>You got all these weird things going on</v>
<v Speaker 3>at that time though.</v>

250
00:10:26.011 --> 00:10:30.480
<v Speaker 3>That's a weird thing that we're in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>back of the mgm grand in a dirty closet</v>

251
00:10:30.481 --> 00:10:33.120
<v Speaker 3>and I'm presenting to a stranger who</v>
<v Speaker 3>refuses,</v>

252
00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:37.350
<v Speaker 3>not only doesn't offer id,</v>
<v Speaker 3>refused to give id and I tried to take a</v>

253
00:10:37.351 --> 00:10:40.020
<v Speaker 3>picture of the son of a bitch and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>told me I could not do that.</v>

254
00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:43.710
<v Speaker 3>Why I backed down and did it to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

255
00:10:43.711 --> 00:10:46.410
<v Speaker 3>I just accepted his authority,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in hindsight call me.</v>

256
00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:47.191
<v Speaker 3>I'm at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

257
00:10:47.191 --> 00:10:48.180
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should've.</v>

258
00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:50.030
<v Speaker 3>I should've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was caught off guard that had</v>

259
00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:52.620
<v Speaker 3>never been done before and I'm kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>just going along,</v>

260
00:10:52.621 --> 00:10:57.621
<v Speaker 3>but I am caught off guard by this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He then wants to stick a needle into</v>

261
00:10:57.751 --> 00:11:01.230
<v Speaker 3>your vein and draw blood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in a back,</v>

262
00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:04.380
<v Speaker 3>unsanitary room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anything I've ever learned in school.</v>

263
00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.780
<v Speaker 3>You don't do things with intermediate</v>
<v Speaker 3>needles.</v>

264
00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:08.790
<v Speaker 3>You don't take.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This guy has no idea.</v>

265
00:11:08.791 --> 00:11:11.070
<v Speaker 3>He's not in a lab coat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't look the part at all.</v>

266
00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:13.950
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so now I presented myself naked to him</v>

267
00:11:13.951 --> 00:11:18.690
<v Speaker 3>and now he's got a needle in my vein and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm signing paperwork that I haven't had</v>

268
00:11:18.691 --> 00:11:21.270
<v Speaker 3>time to read.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when he goes to now understand,</v>

269
00:11:21.271 --> 00:11:23.330
<v Speaker 3>I speak English,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we at least speak the same language.</v>

270
00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:26.730
<v Speaker 3>Also take into consideration that kind</v>
<v Speaker 3>of got in fairness,</v>

271
00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:28.800
<v Speaker 3>perfectly nice guy trying to feed his</v>
<v Speaker 3>family,</v>

272
00:11:28.801 --> 00:11:31.650
<v Speaker 3>but in fairness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what kind of person says,</v>

273
00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.460
<v Speaker 3>I want to go around and collect people's</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pii.</v>

274
00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:37.260
<v Speaker 3>It's an interesting kind of guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm with.</v>

275
00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:39.120
<v Speaker 3>I'm with an interesting character to</v>
<v Speaker 3>start with.</v>

276
00:11:39.121 --> 00:11:41.610
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm naked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now he's poking me with needles in a</v>

277
00:11:41.611 --> 00:11:45.540
<v Speaker 3>dirty backroom at the MGM grand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He leaves there and goes to test</v>

278
00:11:45.541 --> 00:11:46.620
<v Speaker 3>vandelay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

279
00:11:46.621 --> 00:11:48.630
<v Speaker 3>when you take everything I said into</v>
<v Speaker 3>consideration,</v>

280
00:11:48.631 --> 00:11:50.280
<v Speaker 3>nobody knew about random testing.</v>

281
00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.270
<v Speaker 3>Nobody knew about a sudden.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody knew anything about this,</v>

282
00:11:52.271 --> 00:11:54.190
<v Speaker 3>that out of competition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>silver vandelay to go,</v>

283
00:11:54.191 --> 00:11:55.180
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know who you are.</v>

284
00:11:55.181 --> 00:11:57.700
<v Speaker 3>You're not presenting it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't fully understand you.</v>

285
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.750
<v Speaker 3>That's fair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And vandelay talked to them and said,</v>

286
00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:04.450
<v Speaker 3>you want me to sign a contract?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get my attorney on the phone,</v>

287
00:12:04.451 --> 00:12:06.070
<v Speaker 3>show me what this thing says.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

288
00:12:06.071 --> 00:12:09.060
<v Speaker 3>he's Kinda going through the p and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>way the story was told us that vandelay</v>

289
00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:09.910
<v Speaker 3>just turned and ran.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

290
00:12:09.911 --> 00:12:12.010
<v Speaker 3>that wasn't true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He stood his ground and talk to this guy</v>

291
00:12:12.011 --> 00:12:12.821
<v Speaker 3>for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

292
00:12:12.821 --> 00:12:14.600
<v Speaker 3>get on the phone with an attorney.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Prove to me who you are.</v>

293
00:12:14.601 --> 00:12:16.780
<v Speaker 3>He did all of these things and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>finally said,</v>

294
00:12:16.781 --> 00:12:18.580
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to get to a press conference.</v>

295
00:12:18.581 --> 00:12:21.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm leaving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got In his car and drove right to the</v>

296
00:12:21.581 --> 00:12:24.610
<v Speaker 3>MGM for the press conference and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't have this backstory at the press</v>

297
00:12:24.611 --> 00:12:25.960
<v Speaker 3>conference,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's what vandelay did.</v>

298
00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:28.360
<v Speaker 3>So when the story came out that he</v>
<v Speaker 3>turned and bolted out the back,</v>

299
00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:30.460
<v Speaker 3>that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He stood and talked to the guy.</v>

300
00:12:30.461 --> 00:12:34.900
<v Speaker 3>He tried to reason with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vandelays never told calmly his side of</v>

301
00:12:34.901 --> 00:12:37.540
<v Speaker 3>the story and that's his side and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>makes a lot of sense.</v>

302
00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:39.580
<v Speaker 3>Even in today's standards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That makes sense.</v>

303
00:12:39.581 --> 00:12:44.110
<v Speaker 3>But back then when no one knew that drug</v>
<v Speaker 3>testers could be showing up,</v>

304
00:12:44.111 --> 00:12:46.830
<v Speaker 3>and once they showed up that you needed</v>
<v Speaker 3>to present yourself naked,</v>

305
00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.580
<v Speaker 3>that you needed to accept,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

306
00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:50.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they were going to draw blood.</v>

307
00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:51.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man vandal.</v>

308
00:12:51.531 --> 00:12:54.130
<v Speaker 3>He had the right to say no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Call my attorney.</v>

309
00:12:54.131 --> 00:12:55.450
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what's going on here.</v>

310
00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:59.290
<v Speaker 3>And the guy wouldn't show id that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>relevant as very relevant when they</v>

311
00:12:59.291 --> 00:13:01.030
<v Speaker 3>banned him for life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

312
00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:01.770
<v Speaker 3>Come on.</v>

313
00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:02.340
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

314
00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:03.860
<v Speaker 1>the way you describe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know it.</v>

315
00:13:03.861 --> 00:13:04.430
<v Speaker 1>Was that okay.</v>

316
00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:07.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never told him what all he's done is</v>

317
00:13:07.161 --> 00:13:07.941
<v Speaker 3>yell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I've always thought,</v>

318
00:13:07.941 --> 00:13:08.480
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>

319
00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:11.000
<v Speaker 3>vandelay timeout.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've actually got a really good site</v>

320
00:13:11.001 --> 00:13:13.160
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come and tell it now.</v>

321
00:13:13.161 --> 00:13:15.050
<v Speaker 3>Under today's standards is a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>

322
00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:17.730
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we know what's going on and we</v>

323
00:13:17.731 --> 00:13:18.400
<v Speaker 3>know there's,</v>

324
00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:22.780
<v Speaker 1>don't know that some crazy Internet</v>
<v Speaker 1>troll can't pretend he's a Usada guy.</v>

325
00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:25.210
<v Speaker 1>Show up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Drag you into a bathroom and take a</v>

326
00:13:25.211 --> 00:13:26.560
<v Speaker 1>picture of your Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

327
00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:29.050
<v Speaker 1>And they will and won't let you won't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let,</v>

328
00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:32.170
<v Speaker 1>won't document who he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll let you just take a simple picture</v>

329
00:13:32.171 --> 00:13:32.801
<v Speaker 1>of him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

330
00:13:32.801 --> 00:13:34.420
<v Speaker 1>that's insane that they don't have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>show Id.</v>

331
00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's tyranny right there.</v>

332
00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:38.980
<v Speaker 1>There,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there has to be some sort of due process</v>

333
00:13:38.981 --> 00:13:42.910
<v Speaker 1>and the athletes are already in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>disadvantageous position in the first</v>

334
00:13:42.911 --> 00:13:43.870
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

335
00:13:43.871 --> 00:13:45.430
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can be fired.</v>

336
00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:47.950
<v Speaker 1>They mean this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this random thing that just shows up,</v>

337
00:13:47.951 --> 00:13:49.600
<v Speaker 1>which I don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what kind of</v>

338
00:13:49.601 --> 00:13:53.860
<v Speaker 1>constitutionality or what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of legalities involved and</v>

339
00:13:53.861 --> 00:13:56.710
<v Speaker 1>just randomly testing someone's bodily</v>
<v Speaker 1>fluids.</v>

340
00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess you sign a contract agreeing to</v>

341
00:13:59.771 --> 00:14:00.910
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but boy,</v>

342
00:14:00.911 --> 00:14:02.830
<v Speaker 1>that feels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That feels shaky.</v>

343
00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:04.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It feels like that can be disputed.</v>

344
00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:07.920
<v Speaker 3>And to your point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you now do sign a contract and you agree</v>

345
00:14:07.921 --> 00:14:10.890
<v Speaker 3>to go into this pool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but back then we did not,</v>

346
00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:11.401
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

347
00:14:11.401 --> 00:14:13.560
<v Speaker 3>I was the first guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vandelay was the second guy.</v>

348
00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:15.630
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we both ended up with suspensions,</v>

349
00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:18.150
<v Speaker 3>but it was different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

350
00:14:18.151 --> 00:14:18.451
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

351
00:14:18.451 --> 00:14:19.620
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to do this,</v>

352
00:14:19.621 --> 00:14:21.930
<v Speaker 3>you got to tell us or you or you got to</v>
<v Speaker 3>tell me right on the spot,</v>

353
00:14:21.931 --> 00:14:23.880
<v Speaker 3>but you've got to at least prove who you</v>
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>

354
00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:27.840
<v Speaker 3>And I would imagine the women must have</v>
<v Speaker 3>women testers come out to watch them,</v>

355
00:14:27.841 --> 00:14:29.310
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know that for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

356
00:14:29.311 --> 00:14:32.310
<v Speaker 3>you hear this thing about these tsa pat</v>
<v Speaker 3>downs and the women feeling violated.</v>

357
00:14:32.311 --> 00:14:34.110
<v Speaker 3>We haven't heard any women's say that</v>
<v Speaker 3>yet,</v>

358
00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:35.680
<v Speaker 3>but at some point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

359
00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:38.280
<v Speaker 3>I just think there's a fine line there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They might have to be a little bit</v>

360
00:14:38.281 --> 00:14:38.950
<v Speaker 3>careful.</v>

361
00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:42.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vandelay had his lifelong suspension</v>

362
00:14:42.251 --> 00:14:43.150
<v Speaker 1>thrown out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

363
00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:48.300
<v Speaker 1>So now he's still in limbo though</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they haven't decided how long he</v>

364
00:14:48.461 --> 00:14:50.500
<v Speaker 1>gets suspended.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what they've done is.</v>

365
00:14:50.501 --> 00:14:52.190
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many years ago was this when this</v>

366
00:14:52.191 --> 00:14:53.024
<v Speaker 1>took place?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three,</v>

367
00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:56.480
<v Speaker 1>three years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the man has not been able to earn a</v>

368
00:14:56.481 --> 00:14:59.510
<v Speaker 1>living in three years doing what he does</v>
<v Speaker 1>best,</v>

369
00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:01.340
<v Speaker 1>which is fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he is,</v>

370
00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:02.960
<v Speaker 1>he's a legend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

371
00:15:02.961 --> 00:15:06.920
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to have a mixed martial</v>
<v Speaker 1>arts hall of fame and you don't include</v>

372
00:15:06.921 --> 00:15:09.410
<v Speaker 1>vandelay Silva,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got a bullshit mixed martial arts</v>

373
00:15:09.411 --> 00:15:10.640
<v Speaker 1>hall of fame.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

374
00:15:10.641 --> 00:15:13.880
<v Speaker 1>you talking about a guy who was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pride champion for a long time,</v>

375
00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had incredible fight,</v>

376
00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:21.490
<v Speaker 1>legendary fights and his beloved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My point was when you and him went at it</v>

377
00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:27.530
<v Speaker 1>on the ultimate fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his fucking popularity crashed because</v>

378
00:15:27.531 --> 00:15:29.840
<v Speaker 1>you made them look foolish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looks silly.</v>

379
00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:33.440
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to start a fight with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was trying to intimidate you and it</v>

380
00:15:33.441 --> 00:15:35.180
<v Speaker 1>wasn't working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

381
00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:37.070
<v Speaker 1>please don't touch me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Please don't touch me.</v>

382
00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:40.310
<v Speaker 1>And then finally you wind up taking them</v>
<v Speaker 1>down and just like Jesus Christ,</v>

383
00:15:40.311 --> 00:15:41.690
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are we doing here?</v>

384
00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:42.351
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

385
00:15:42.351 --> 00:15:43.970
<v Speaker 3>it was really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

386
00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:45.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to explain that to vandelay on</v>

387
00:15:45.741 --> 00:15:48.150
<v Speaker 3>the set,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was a battle to and,</v>

388
00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:50.540
<v Speaker 3>and vandelay walked out on the very</v>
<v Speaker 3>first day.</v>

389
00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:52.950
<v Speaker 3>He demanded an apology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

390
00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:54.450
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he comes in front of everybody.</v>

391
00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:56.870
<v Speaker 3>Cameras are rolling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're about to pick teams.</v>

392
00:15:56.871 --> 00:16:00.290
<v Speaker 3>So it's got all the guys there and his</v>
<v Speaker 3>way of taking the moral high ground was</v>

393
00:16:00.291 --> 00:16:02.990
<v Speaker 3>to demand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I apologize and if I don't then he</v>

394
00:16:02.991 --> 00:16:05.030
<v Speaker 3>quits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like Vandelay,</v>

395
00:16:05.031 --> 00:16:07.940
<v Speaker 3>why'd you put yourself in that position?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not gonna apologize,</v>

396
00:16:07.941 --> 00:16:10.010
<v Speaker 3>but why would you say you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>quit now?</v>

397
00:16:10.011 --> 00:16:11.210
<v Speaker 3>You have to quit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

398
00:16:11.211 --> 00:16:13.100
<v Speaker 3>You have to walk out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he does.</v>

399
00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:15.470
<v Speaker 3>When I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I call his is he walks off the set</v>

400
00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:17.090
<v Speaker 3>camera,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stop everything.</v>

401
00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:21.890
<v Speaker 3>They put us in the back and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm telling the producers I'm not</v>

402
00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:23.150
<v Speaker 3>going to come out and apologize.</v>

403
00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:24.920
<v Speaker 3>Call Vittorio Vituro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come out and do it.</v>

404
00:16:24.921 --> 00:16:26.570

<v Speaker 3>That's how we're going to solve this.</v>

405
00:16:26.571 --> 00:16:29.450
<v Speaker 3>Now we can't call it a uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I want this show to go forward,</v>

409
00:16:33.531 --> 00:16:37.760

<v Speaker 3>The storyline is the bad guy has come to</v>

<v Speaker 3>Let's continue the script.</v>

412
00:16:42.831 --> 00:16:46.190
<v Speaker 3>So I had to talk to vandelay and a</v>
<v Speaker 3>private room and I had explained that to</v>

413
00:16:46.191 --> 00:16:47.024
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Mandalay,</v>

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:49.040
<v Speaker 3>I get what you're doing here and you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to be the good guy,</v>

415

<v Speaker 3>but guess what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are just let me go do what I do.</v>

417
00:16:55.311 --> 00:16:58.490
<v Speaker 3>shining armor and I'm okay with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not okay being the bag.</v>

418
00:16:58.491 --> 00:16:59.324
<v Speaker 3>I am.</v>

421
00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:07.340
<v Speaker 3>And I couldn't reason with him Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He really did not understand it.</v>

422
00:17:07.341 --> 00:17:08.510
<v Speaker 3>And he does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's saying,</v>

423
00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:09.650
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

426
00:17:12.850 --> 00:17:15.770
<v Speaker 3>and I broke it down to a zoo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

427
00:17:15.771 --> 00:17:17.900
<v Speaker 3>he was doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was breaking it down and he's telling</v>

428
00:17:17.901 --> 00:17:21.070
<v Speaker 3>me how I'm doing everything wrong and in</v>

<v Speaker 3>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stop.</v>

431
00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:26.780

433
00:17:28.791 --> 00:17:31.880
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not the guy you tell how to promote.</v>

434
00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:34.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm the guy you cop and I was just</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to level with them.</v>

435
00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:38.280
<v Speaker 3>I'm the guy you copy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the reason that,</v>

436
00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:41.120
<v Speaker 3>that all these things are happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>he agreed with me on that.</v>

438
00:17:43.071 --> 00:17:44.180
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand that,</v>

439
00:17:44.181 --> 00:17:45.610
<v Speaker 3>but I don't like how you did that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

440
00:17:45.611 --> 00:17:46.251
<v Speaker 3>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>great.</v>

441
00:17:46.251 --> 00:17:48.200
<v Speaker 3>Then here's what we're going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to do this show.</v>

442
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:50.130
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to to be the bad guy.</v>

443
00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:53.410
<v Speaker 4>And then we're gonna fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you're so sure you're going to.</v>

444
00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:54.271
<v Speaker 4>I mean this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

445
00:17:54.271 --> 00:17:56.010
<v Speaker 4>this is your moment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he was ranting on me for the</v>

446
00:17:56.011 --> 00:17:56.844
<v Speaker 4>andersons thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

447
00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:58.770
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did you see how that fight worked out?</v>

448
00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:00.810
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I took my punishment,</v>

449
00:18:00.811 --> 00:18:02.010
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had to eat it all.</v>

450
00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:03.840
<v Speaker 4>It's an embarrassing thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I did it that,</v>

451
00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:07.020
<v Speaker 4>that's my payback for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You and I are on a separate deal.</v>

452
00:18:07.021 --> 00:18:08.880
<v Speaker 4>You're trying to insert yourself in an</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anderson fight.</v>

453
00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:10.860
<v Speaker 4>Anderson already took care of that</v>
<v Speaker 4>matter.</v>

454
00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:12.090
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He handled his button,</v>

455
00:18:12.091 --> 00:18:15.270
<v Speaker 4>but now you've got to handle yours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it was just a weird thing and we</v>

456
00:18:15.271 --> 00:18:16.440
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we just couldn't.</v>

457
00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:20.490
<v Speaker 4>We just couldn't come around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well you are an interesting guy to get</v>

458
00:18:20.491 --> 00:18:25.491
<v Speaker 4>into these altercations with because</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're very logical and because you can</v>

459
00:18:26.401 --> 00:18:30.900
<v Speaker 4>say a bunch of crazy shit and not take</v>
<v Speaker 4>it personal and I just don't think that</v>

460
00:18:30.901 --> 00:18:33.210
<v Speaker 4>he has that kind of mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His mind,</v>

461
00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:35.630
<v Speaker 4>his</v>
<v Speaker 4>depression,</v>

462
00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:40.550
<v Speaker 4>but that's him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he just wants to throw down and</v>

463
00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:42.960
<v Speaker 4>so he expected you to butt heads with</v>
<v Speaker 4>them and you're like,</v>

464
00:18:42.961 --> 00:18:44.070
<v Speaker 4>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>come on.</v>

465
00:18:44.071 --> 00:18:45.540
<v Speaker 4>We're here to make some money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're on TV.</v>

466
00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:48.070
<v Speaker 4>We're going to promote this zoo.</v>

467
00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:54.060
<v Speaker 4>And it just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was no fucking way he was.</v>

468
00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:58.080
<v Speaker 4>I mean he just came into this with this</v>
<v Speaker 4>idea that he was going to go shoot the</v>

469
00:18:58.081 --> 00:19:01.080
<v Speaker 4>buck style that he was going to get in</v>
<v Speaker 4>your face and get angry and maybe you</v>

470
00:19:01.081 --> 00:19:03.090
<v Speaker 4>guys were brought on the set,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

471
00:19:03.091 --> 00:19:05.310
<v Speaker 4>but you just weren't having it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't having an end,</v>

472
00:19:05.311 --> 00:19:09.000
<v Speaker 4>but I also understood this vandelay I</v>
<v Speaker 4>want to be the bad guy and this is my</v>

473
00:19:09.001 --> 00:19:12.570
<v Speaker 4>brand and this is what I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm the only guy on that side of the</v>

474
00:19:12.571 --> 00:19:15.850
<v Speaker 4>pool because I'm the only guy that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>willing to be so I'm the biggest healing</v>

475
00:19:15.851 --> 00:19:18.210
<v Speaker 4>in the business right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I know this.</v>

476
00:19:18.211 --> 00:19:22.080
<v Speaker 4>If I come into your country by myself</v>
<v Speaker 4>and not speaking the language and you</v>

477
00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.490
<v Speaker 4>team up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you gang,</v>

478
00:19:23.491 --> 00:19:25.920
<v Speaker 4>you team up on me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I become vulnerable.</v>

479
00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:28.740
<v Speaker 4>If they see me as vulnerable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're going to like me.</v>

480
00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:31.320
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to be like you're ruining</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>

481
00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:34.080
<v Speaker 4>And I knew if we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if push came to shove,</v>

482
00:19:34.081 --> 00:19:36.810
<v Speaker 4>they're going to take vandelay side.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to come and short,</v>

483
00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:39.660
<v Speaker 4>but in the world of public opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to come out on top,</v>

484
00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:42.200
<v Speaker 4>which I've worked very hard that I don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>want to be on that side.</v>

485
00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:45.210
<v Speaker 4>That's not where I'm trying to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm down there,</v>

486
00:19:45.211 --> 00:19:46.410
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm all by myself,</v>

487
00:19:46.411 --> 00:19:51.411
<v Speaker 4>which means I'm ruling that part of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>market and I was pleading with him when</v>

488
00:19:51.481 --> 00:19:54.030
<v Speaker 4>he was trying to get in a street fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember even saying to him,</v>

489
00:19:54.031 --> 00:19:56.550
<v Speaker 4>please stop like Vangelis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>please.</v>

490
00:19:56.551 --> 00:19:58.350
<v Speaker 4>I don't this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to do this.</v>

491
00:19:58.410 --> 00:20:00.960
<v Speaker 4>Let's get a date.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's save it for the octagon and he</v>

492
00:20:00.961 --> 00:20:01.680
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

493
00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:04.020
<v Speaker 4>he saw that as weakness and as soon as</v>
<v Speaker 4>he saw the weakness,</v>

494
00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:05.280
<v Speaker 4>he started picking on me.</v>

495
00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:05.801
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>vandelay,</v>

496
00:20:05.801 --> 00:20:08.220
<v Speaker 4>if you pick on me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I become likable.</v>

497
00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:11.040
<v Speaker 4>I don't want that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what this is all about.</v>

498
00:20:11.041 --> 00:20:11.970
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm down there.</v>

499
00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:13.410
<v Speaker 4>You guys be down here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

500
00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:15.720
<v Speaker 4>I'll be the nerd sitting at the end of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the pool by himself,</v>

501
00:20:15.721 --> 00:20:20.640
<v Speaker 4>but that's still my end of the pool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Will you approach this in a very</v>

502
00:20:20.641 --> 00:20:23.280
<v Speaker 4>calculated way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is very rare for people when</v>

503
00:20:23.281 --> 00:20:25.980
<v Speaker 4>they're doing promotion for fights.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

504
00:20:25.981 --> 00:20:27.570
<v Speaker 4>there's shit-talking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

505
00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:29.400
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people say I'm the best ever.</v>

506
00:20:29.401 --> 00:20:31.140
<v Speaker 4>They Brag,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they do all sorts of different things,</v>

507
00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:36.440
<v Speaker 4>but it's very rare that they purposely</v>
<v Speaker 4>put themselves in one position and you</v>

508
00:20:37.051 --> 00:20:39.960
<v Speaker 4>did it on purpose and you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you are the only guy that really had a</v>

509
00:20:39.961 --> 00:20:41.220
<v Speaker 4>vision.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You like,</v>

510
00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:44.070
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody out here is doing it one way,</v>

511
00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:47.160
<v Speaker 4>but there's a way to do it completely</v>
<v Speaker 4>over the top,</v>

512
00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:48.340
<v Speaker 4>but you obviously</v>

513
00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:52.450
<v Speaker 1>had skills to back it up as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you were completely over the top and</v>

514
00:20:52.451 --> 00:20:55.510
<v Speaker 1>you cherish the role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you took the microphone,</v>

515
00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:55.870
<v Speaker 1>went</v>

516
00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:58.720
<v Speaker 2>Anderson Silva,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you absolutely suck.</v>

517
00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:01.060
<v Speaker 2>Like the whole place started cheering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

518
00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:02.170
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's.</v>

519
00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:05.560
<v Speaker 2>He's gone straight pro wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're the first guy to ever do</v>

520
00:21:05.561 --> 00:21:06.220
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

521
00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:07.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's cut a promo.</v>

522
00:21:07.361 --> 00:21:09.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean let's tame attainment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know we are an entertainment and I</v>

523
00:21:09.851 --> 00:21:14.500
<v Speaker 2>firmly believe when one fight ends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the marketing for the next fight begins</v>

524
00:21:14.501 --> 00:21:15.850
<v Speaker 2>right then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

525
00:21:15.851 --> 00:21:19.090
<v Speaker 2>That are paying attention the most.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I hear people tell you all the day,</v>

526
00:21:19.091 --> 00:21:21.680
<v Speaker 2>who do you want to fight next and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>giving them an opportunity where your</v>

527
00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:24.670
<v Speaker 2>softball on them right down the middle</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they say,</v>

528
00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:28.520
<v Speaker 2>anybody in their message what they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they want to be related.</v>

529
00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:30.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a bully.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll take on anybody.</v>

530
00:21:30.701 --> 00:21:32.410
<v Speaker 2>I'll take on all comers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care.</v>

531
00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:34.960
<v Speaker 2>I get that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not what people are hearing.</v>

532
00:21:34.961 --> 00:21:38.620
<v Speaker 2>If you say you don't care,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can you expect anybody else to?</v>

533
00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:41.430
<v Speaker 2>If you tell the whole world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care who I'm fighting,</v>

534
00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:43.780
<v Speaker 2>well then how in the hell can a fan</v>
<v Speaker 2>care?</v>

535
00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:47.200
<v Speaker 2>How can they care about you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to care whether it's a personal</v>

536
00:21:47.201 --> 00:21:49.180
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether whether it's a career move,</v>

537
00:21:49.181 --> 00:21:50.530
<v Speaker 2>whether it's the title of whatever it</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

538
00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:52.990
<v Speaker 2>you have to care and there has to be an</v>
<v Speaker 2>answer.</v>

539
00:21:52.991 --> 00:21:54.100
<v Speaker 2>If you don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care.</v>

540
00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:56.500
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's ever gotten a job job by</v>
<v Speaker 2>telling the guy,</v>

541
00:21:56.501 --> 00:21:57.470
<v Speaker 2>interviewing him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

542
00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:00.140
<v Speaker 2>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that I can't hire you.</v>

543
00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:02.050
<v Speaker 2>I just can't hire you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

544
00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:03.700
<v Speaker 2>Especially if there's someone who does</v>
<v Speaker 2>care.</v>

545
00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.360
<v Speaker 2>Now there's a mention of when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I tried to get in your podcast</v>

546
00:22:07.361 --> 00:22:08.380
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you'd have said,</v>

547
00:22:08.381 --> 00:22:09.730
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you free on Monday?</v>

548
00:22:09.731 --> 00:22:10.290
<v Speaker 2>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

549
00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:11.230
<v Speaker 2>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You Go,</v>

550
00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:13.360
<v Speaker 2>well then I'll just call somebody else</v>
<v Speaker 2>jail.</v>

551
00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:15.390
<v Speaker 2>I need a guy in the studio that wants to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be here.</v>

552
00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:17.170
<v Speaker 2>What you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to be here.</v>

553
00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:19.420
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't worry about that with you if</v>

554
00:22:19.421 --> 00:22:20.530
<v Speaker 2>you said I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

555
00:22:20.531 --> 00:22:23.320
<v Speaker 2>but like good sales in a weird mood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is going to be a fun podcast.</v>

556
00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:25.660
<v Speaker 2>Fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's a.</v>

557
00:22:25.661 --> 00:22:26.240
<v Speaker 2>there's an</v>

558
00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:28.400
<v Speaker 1>psychology that goes along with fighting</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of them,</v>

559
00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:31.100
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that happens to people</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're preparing for a fight,</v>

560
00:22:31.101 --> 00:22:36.101
<v Speaker 1>and you could speak to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that there's a sort of a compulsion</v>

561
00:22:36.891 --> 00:22:37.990
<v Speaker 1>or a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

562
00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:42.710
<v Speaker 1>a feeling that you would like to avoid</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about the fight as much as</v>

563
00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:43.310
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

564
00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:47.060
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a natural sort of attraction to</v>

565
00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:48.980
<v Speaker 1>just putting it aside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's like,</v>

566
00:22:48.981 --> 00:22:51.440
<v Speaker 1>let's just not think about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's not think about this at all.</v>

567
00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:56.270
<v Speaker 1>Let's only focus on the task at hand and</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the task in hand is over,</v>

568
00:22:56.330 --> 00:23:00.560
<v Speaker 1>then we're going to take a break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when a fight is over and the relief</v>

569
00:23:00.561 --> 00:23:03.120
<v Speaker 1>has hit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy like to shift gears and go</v>

570
00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:07.730
<v Speaker 1>straight into promo mode.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes guys have done it and they've</v>

571
00:23:07.731 --> 00:23:10.670
<v Speaker 1>done it and it comes off artificial and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it comes off clunky.</v>

572
00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:13.010
<v Speaker 1>It actually hurts them more than it</v>
<v Speaker 1>helps them.</v>

573
00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:17.180
<v Speaker 1>Like it seems like it takes a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>specific type of personality to be able</v>

574
00:23:17.181 --> 00:23:18.230
<v Speaker 1>to pull that off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

575
00:23:18.231 --> 00:23:18.570
<v Speaker 1>Directly.</v>

576
00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:19.710
<v Speaker 2>I think that's fair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

577
00:23:19.711 --> 00:23:22.980
<v Speaker 2>And I've seen some guys do it and I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ben Rothwell comes to mind.</v>

578
00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:25.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well we'll have some pocketed and even</v>

579
00:23:25.651 --> 00:23:27.990
<v Speaker 2>an awkwardness or something to see</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

580
00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:29.730
<v Speaker 2>It's not a total miss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It.</v>

581
00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:31.890
<v Speaker 2>It does come across as pocket and</v>
<v Speaker 2>scripted in.</v>

582
00:23:31.891 --> 00:23:36.891
<v Speaker 2>My only advice to Rothwell is if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a pocket of statement and you're</v>

583
00:23:36.961 --> 00:23:39.840
<v Speaker 2>not ready for the followup question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drop the mic and walk away.</v>

584
00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:42.600
<v Speaker 2>Here's your bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>An exit stage left.</v>

585
00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:44.700
<v Speaker 2>And yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very hard.</v>

586
00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:47.510
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to say something you want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>say.</v>

587
00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:50.210
<v Speaker 2>And when the followup question comes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go back into being yourself.</v>

588
00:23:50.211 --> 00:23:51.770
<v Speaker 2>That's very hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got your look.</v>

589
00:23:51.771 --> 00:23:54.890
<v Speaker 2>If you take a character,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you finished the character until it's</v>

590
00:23:54.891 --> 00:23:56.720
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you're stuck.</v>

591
00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:58.670
<v Speaker 2>Walkaway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

592
00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:01.820
<v Speaker 2>Like Daniel Cormier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I interviewed him after he beat</v>

593
00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:03.950
<v Speaker 2>Rumble Johnson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>John Jones,</v>

594
00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:05.960
<v Speaker 2>get your shit together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

595
00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:07.360
<v Speaker 2>Perfect.</v>

596
00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:08.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was great.</v>

597
00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:09.680
<v Speaker 2>It was perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Dan,</v>

598
00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:10.580
<v Speaker 2>let's stay on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Daniel.</v>

599
00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:14.870
<v Speaker 2>Daniel this week was in one of the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a very weird spot.</v>

600
00:24:14.871 --> 00:24:18.470
<v Speaker 2>So Daniel comes in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not just a good guy of mma.</v>

601
00:24:18.471 --> 00:24:19.550
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the great guy.</v>

602
00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:23.090
<v Speaker 2>Daniel never will somebody meet that guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>face to face,</v>

603
00:24:23.091 --> 00:24:25.910
<v Speaker 2>but what did your never will?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's amazing is how much he gets</v>

604
00:24:25.911 --> 00:24:27.560
<v Speaker 2>booed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my point,</v>

605
00:24:27.561 --> 00:24:30.890
<v Speaker 2>but everybody hates him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You then have John Jones who is a real</v>

606
00:24:30.891 --> 00:24:35.600
<v Speaker 2>life heal that wants to be loved and for</v>
<v Speaker 2>some reason the crowd used to be against</v>

607
00:24:35.601 --> 00:24:37.910
<v Speaker 2>him and now they find out he's really</v>
<v Speaker 2>find out who he is.</v>

608
00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:39.140
<v Speaker 2>They love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're in.</v>

609
00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:41.120
<v Speaker 2>Why do they?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They love him more.</v>

610
00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:43.280
<v Speaker 2>They love him more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that he's keeps fucking up.</v>

611
00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:46.730
<v Speaker 2>Daniel Cormier was at a press conference</v>
<v Speaker 2>with Jones and Jones says,</v>

612
00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:49.310
<v Speaker 2>I've been sober for three months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the crowd goes crazy.</v>

613
00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:51.710
<v Speaker 2>They then shift the camera over to</v>
<v Speaker 2>Daniel.</v>

614
00:24:51.711 --> 00:24:53.090
<v Speaker 2>The whole crowd starts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We hadn't even said anything.</v>

615
00:24:53.091 --> 00:24:55.100
<v Speaker 2>They all start booing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Daniel takes a mic and goes,</v>

616
00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:58.160
<v Speaker 2>you guys are cheering that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's been sober for 90 days.</v>

617
00:24:58.161 --> 00:25:01.190
<v Speaker 2>I've been sober for 36 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They boom again.</v>

618
00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:04.490
<v Speaker 2>They hated it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Daniel gets put in this weird spot.</v>

619
00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:08.900
<v Speaker 2>He brings that momentum into this fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He then becomes vulnerable.</v>

620
00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:11.840
<v Speaker 2>His heart's out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He shows the world that he takes the</v>

621
00:25:11.841 --> 00:25:12.680
<v Speaker 2>high road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>

622
00:25:12.681 --> 00:25:15.620
<v Speaker 2>I think that Jon Jones made a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've made mistakes before.</v>

623
00:25:15.621 --> 00:25:17.120
<v Speaker 2>He starts telling these personal</v>
<v Speaker 2>stories,</v>

624
00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:19.970
<v Speaker 2>his heart that he's in tears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody loves him.</v>

625
00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:22.580
<v Speaker 2>All of a sudden he goes into the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anderson,</v>

626
00:25:22.581 --> 00:25:23.720
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

627
00:25:23.721 --> 00:25:26.920
<v Speaker 2>People love the appreciation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He stepped up great middle,</v>

628
00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:31.250
<v Speaker 2>all these different things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Daniel gets beat or rather beats him.</v>

629
00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:36.600
<v Speaker 2>The crowd boos and the Daniel tries to</v>
<v Speaker 2>address the audience explaining himself.</v>

630
00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:38.960
<v Speaker 2>It's like Daniel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple of rules and politics.</v>

631
00:25:38.961 --> 00:25:40.790
<v Speaker 2>First off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you steer into a problem of a crowd</v>

632
00:25:40.791 --> 00:25:42.400
<v Speaker 2>wants to boot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't ever ask them for their</v>

633
00:25:42.401 --> 00:25:43.520
<v Speaker 2>approval.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You take the mic,</v>

634
00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:47.600
<v Speaker 2>you hold your belt up high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You thank them all for the percentage of</v>

635
00:25:47.601 --> 00:25:50.360
<v Speaker 2>their ticket sales that you got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You tell him to shove their opinion up</v>

636
00:25:50.361 --> 00:25:53.510
<v Speaker 2>their ass and you walk away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're explaining,</v>

637
00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:56.090
<v Speaker 2>you're losing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do not explain yourself.</v>

638
00:25:56.091 --> 00:25:57.560
<v Speaker 2>Do not say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to do what I had to do.</v>

639
00:25:57.740 --> 00:25:59.870
<v Speaker 2>There's such A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm tired of the misrepresentations</v>

640
00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:02.540
<v Speaker 2>representations and fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It comes all the way from the top.</v>

641
00:26:02.541 --> 00:26:05.510
<v Speaker 2>We hear that the fans want to guys that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are going to go out there and bang,</v>

642
00:26:05.511 --> 00:26:06.321
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not true.</v>

643
00:26:06.321 --> 00:26:07.850
<v Speaker 2>The biggest draw in the history of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>sports,</v>

644
00:26:07.851 --> 00:26:10.100
<v Speaker 2>George St Pierre,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he never went up there and banged with</v>

645
00:26:10.101 --> 00:26:13.460
<v Speaker 2>anybody who finishes it is a very</v>
<v Speaker 2>handsome man.</v>

646
00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:15.500
<v Speaker 2>He's very marketable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will concede that,</v>

647
00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:19.850
<v Speaker 2>but the bottom line is that's not</v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily what people want and the</v>

648
00:26:19.851 --> 00:26:24.851
<v Speaker 2>exact same game plan that did is what</v>
<v Speaker 2>lester did five minutes later and</v>

649
00:26:24.921 --> 00:26:27.080
<v Speaker 2>everybody loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That that's not what it's about.</v>

650
00:26:27.081 --> 00:26:30.080
<v Speaker 2>What they decided they want to see</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anderson when they weren't upset that</v>

651
00:26:30.081 --> 00:26:32.030
<v Speaker 2>they were on the ground there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if they weren't on their feet</v>

652
00:26:32.031 --> 00:26:33.740
<v Speaker 2>because they knew that's where I</v>
<v Speaker 2>understood could knock him out and they</v>

653
00:26:33.741 --> 00:26:36.950
<v Speaker 2>decided they were going to cheer for</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anderson Cormier.</v>

654
00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:39.410
<v Speaker 2>I should have just told him to shove it</v>
<v Speaker 2>up their ass and they'd be stuck.</v>

655
00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:41.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not him at all.</v>

656
00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:44.010
<v Speaker 2>But he wants to be liked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wants to be like</v>

657
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:45.360
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand that,</v>

658
00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:48.060
<v Speaker 1>but that's not the way to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the only way to be liked as him to</v>

659
00:26:48.061 --> 00:26:51.780
<v Speaker 1>beat the shit out of John Jones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that was the only way because</v>

660
00:26:51.781 --> 00:26:56.220
<v Speaker 1>right now he's got a title that let's</v>
<v Speaker 1>just be completely honest about what it</v>

661
00:26:56.221 --> 00:26:59.070
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a title that he beat the</v>

662
00:26:59.071 --> 00:27:02.340
<v Speaker 1>champion to get sure he had to take it</v>
<v Speaker 1>away from the champion.</v>

663
00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:07.580
<v Speaker 1>And the public recognizes that and while</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Jones may be screwing up a lot,</v>

664
00:27:09.421 --> 00:27:12.570
<v Speaker 1>he may have all these problems outside</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the octagon,</v>

665
00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:15.750
<v Speaker 1>inside the octagon and no one has been</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to best him.</v>

666
00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:17.400
<v Speaker 1>He's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because of that,</v>

667
00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:20.880
<v Speaker 1>because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are on his side because people</v>

668
00:27:20.881 --> 00:27:22.350
<v Speaker 1>love winners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just do,</v>

669
00:27:22.351 --> 00:27:25.170
<v Speaker 1>they love Mike Tyson when he was in his</v>
<v Speaker 1>prime and you know,</v>

670
00:27:25.171 --> 00:27:28.050
<v Speaker 1>even when he came out of jail for</v>
<v Speaker 1>alleged rape,</v>

671
00:27:28.051 --> 00:27:29.100
<v Speaker 1>he claims he never did it.</v>

672
00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:30.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what happened obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

673
00:27:30.991 --> 00:27:33.990
<v Speaker 1>but when he came out of jail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were still rooting for him.</v>

674
00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:35.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a guy who,</v>

675
00:27:35.131 --> 00:27:36.840
<v Speaker 1>if you have daughters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have daughters,</v>

676
00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:39.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have a girl and you hope,</v>

677
00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:41.310
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the worst case scenario is my,</v>

678
00:27:41.490 --> 00:27:45.870
<v Speaker 1>my daughter finds herself in a position</v>
<v Speaker 1>where a man wants to physically do</v>

679
00:27:45.871 --> 00:27:48.630
<v Speaker 1>something to her that she doesn't want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People didn't give a fuck.</v>

680
00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:52.800
<v Speaker 1>They were like Mike Tyson's back back</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's still looking angry and he's</v>

681
00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:55.210
<v Speaker 1>rip now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's been doing prison workouts and</v>

682
00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:59.910
<v Speaker 1>there's something about a guy who's just</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bad motherfucker that people love.</v>

683
00:27:59.911 --> 00:28:01.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a.</v>

684
00:28:01.531 --> 00:28:05.790
<v Speaker 1>there's a thing where they know that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Daniel feels that there's a thing where</v>

685
00:28:05.791 --> 00:28:10.791
<v Speaker 1>they know that Daniel knows that John is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy who won the first fight,</v>

686
00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:13.560
<v Speaker 1>that John is the legitimate linear</v>
<v Speaker 1>champion.</v>

687
00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:18.360
<v Speaker 1>That John is the undefeated fighter and</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally the only undefeated fighter at</v>

688
00:28:18.361 --> 00:28:19.560
<v Speaker 1>that level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no one.</v>

689
00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:23.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean he has one loss to Matt Hamill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a bullshit disqualification</v>

690
00:28:23.131 --> 00:28:26.160
<v Speaker 1>from a dumb fucking rule which said a</v>
<v Speaker 1>million times.</v>

691
00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:28.010
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's more angry about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you,</v>

692
00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:30.700
<v Speaker 1>Jon Jones is not as frustrated about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that loss issue.</v>

693
00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:33.290
<v Speaker 1>Our madness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the law,</v>

694
00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:36.540
<v Speaker 1>the law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rule is madness and it only exists.</v>

695
00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:41.010
<v Speaker 1>I talked to big John Mccarthy about this</v>
<v Speaker 1>extensively only exists because the</v>

696
00:28:41.011 --> 00:28:42.310
<v Speaker 1>commission was ignorant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

697
00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:45.180
<v Speaker 1>They didn't understand that those bricks</v>
<v Speaker 1>breakers,</v>

698
00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:47.570
<v Speaker 1>it's not that hard to break a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>brick man.</v>

699
00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:49.710
<v Speaker 1>Seems crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's really just not.</v>

700
00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:51.840
<v Speaker 1>Especially when they are spread wide</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

701
00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:56.270
<v Speaker 1>But John Jones has that aura of</v>
<v Speaker 1>invincibility about him.</v>

702
00:28:56.271 --> 00:28:57.600
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he fought rumble,</v>

703
00:28:57.601 --> 00:29:00.390
<v Speaker 1>Johnson rumble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Johnson head kicked him into oblivion</v>

704
00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:02.730
<v Speaker 1>and we see John was toes curled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

705
00:29:02.731 --> 00:29:06.660
<v Speaker 1>lying on his back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>snoring which absolutely can happen to</v>

706
00:29:06.661 --> 00:29:07.494
<v Speaker 1>any human.</v>

707
00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:10.890
<v Speaker 1>Then the whole thing would change and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think the walls would come crumbling</v>

708
00:29:10.891 --> 00:29:14.220
<v Speaker 1>down and if John did a press conference</v>
<v Speaker 1>and said he was 30 days sober,</v>

709
00:29:14.221 --> 00:29:15.990
<v Speaker 1>they will start booing them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't give a fuck.</v>

710
00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:17.880
<v Speaker 1>I think that's fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

711
00:29:17.881 --> 00:29:19.530
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>America does love success.</v>

712
00:29:19.531 --> 00:29:21.360
<v Speaker 1>Fans are front runners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've got the right to be,</v>

713
00:29:21.361 --> 00:29:22.920
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>historically that is how it worked and</v>

714
00:29:22.921 --> 00:29:25.170
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about rumble Johnson and</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Jones.</v>

715
00:29:25.171 --> 00:29:26.550
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got to get that match up.</v>

716
00:29:26.590 --> 00:29:28.380
<v Speaker 1>We fuck they fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

717
00:29:28.381 --> 00:29:30.420
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing is fucked up and that in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

718
00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:35.190
<v Speaker 1>that hasn't happened because he's in</v>
<v Speaker 1>real danger with clover like that.</v>

719
00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:38.370
<v Speaker 1>That air of invincibility was taken away</v>
<v Speaker 1>from him by,</v>

720
00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:41.160
<v Speaker 1>by um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Daniel Daniel beat him and he broke</v>

721
00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:42.520
<v Speaker 1>Daniel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beat him down,</v>

722
00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:45.790
<v Speaker 1>took his back and choked him and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could see rumble,</v>

723
00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:49.270
<v Speaker 1>just having a real hard time with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was going on in that fight.</v>

724
00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:52.990
<v Speaker 1>He had given his all and that first</v>
<v Speaker 1>round he had hit danny with a bomb,</v>

725
00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:56.410
<v Speaker 1>like literally took him off of his feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sent him flying across the octagon.</v>

726
00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:59.080
<v Speaker 1>But Daniel is tough as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he survived.</v>

727
00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:03.670
<v Speaker 1>He gutted it out and then he imposed his</v>
<v Speaker 1>superior wrestling and wound up winning.</v>

728
00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:08.970
<v Speaker 1>So we lost a lot there because that</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight was supposed to be Jon Jones and</v>

729
00:30:10.061 --> 00:30:12.510
<v Speaker 1>Rumble Johnson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then Jon Jones Rumble Johnson would</v>

730
00:30:12.511 --> 00:30:15.730
<v Speaker 1>have been fucking epic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would've been really interesting to</v>

731
00:30:15.731 --> 00:30:19.410
<v Speaker 1>see what happens when a guy who hits</v>
<v Speaker 1>like rumble connects with a guy like</v>

732
00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:21.220
<v Speaker 1>John.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And especially back then when we didn't</v>

733
00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:24.750
<v Speaker 1>know what would happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know that Josh Koscheck had beaten</v>

734
00:30:24.751 --> 00:30:27.940
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he had real hard time in the later</v>

735
00:30:27.941 --> 00:30:31.990
<v Speaker 1>rounds when he was competing at one 70.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we also knew that there's no fucking</v>

736
00:30:31.991 --> 00:30:35.380
<v Speaker 1>way you should have been at one 70 even</v>
<v Speaker 1>when fall [inaudible] 85.</v>

737
00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:38.260
<v Speaker 1>It was kind of the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He came out like a bat out of hell and</v>

738
00:30:38.261 --> 00:30:41.410
<v Speaker 1>then faded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we assumed that he also missed</v>

739
00:30:41.411 --> 00:30:44.060
<v Speaker 1>one 85 against veto by seven pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

740
00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:46.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean he had a notorious problem with</v>
<v Speaker 1>his weight.</v>

741
00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:49.750
<v Speaker 1>So we kind of attributed a lot of his</v>
<v Speaker 1>failures to that.</v>

742
00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:53.890
<v Speaker 1>And we see him at heavyweight beat the</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit out of our lawsky break as John the</v>

743
00:30:53.891 --> 00:30:55.690
<v Speaker 1>first round,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just Tulum for three.</v>

744
00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:56.501
<v Speaker 1>And we say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

745
00:30:56.501 --> 00:30:57.610
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well rumble at two.</v>

746
00:30:57.611 --> 00:30:59.980
<v Speaker 1>Oh five is the fucking man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We missed that.</v>

747
00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:01.300
<v Speaker 1>Ms Dot opportunities.</v>

748
00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:02.081
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

749
00:31:02.081 --> 00:31:02.740
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>

750
00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:06.720
<v Speaker 3>when you bring up Rumble Rashad who</v>
<v Speaker 3>trained with both John Jones and rob</v>

751
00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:07.690
<v Speaker 3>says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rumbled beats him.</v>

752
00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:10.810
<v Speaker 3>Now rumble only does have one problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He is a front runner.</v>

753
00:31:10.811 --> 00:31:13.690
<v Speaker 3>He does fade a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's a big storm that he brings,</v>

754
00:31:13.691 --> 00:31:15.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rda fights that way.</v>

755
00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:18.630
<v Speaker 3>He started Amanda Nunez fights that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Her own teammates.</v>

756
00:31:18.631 --> 00:31:19.151
<v Speaker 3>We're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

757
00:31:19.151 --> 00:31:20.500
<v Speaker 3>if she gets into the second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>third round,</v>

758
00:31:20.501 --> 00:31:22.750
<v Speaker 3>I don't know about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she's going to bring a storm in that</v>

759
00:31:22.751 --> 00:31:26.020
<v Speaker 3>first round Ou and I don't think Misha</v>
<v Speaker 3>can survive it.</v>

760
00:31:26.021 --> 00:31:28.480
<v Speaker 3>I talked to Dustin Porsche,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he trains with Amanda and he said that</v>

761
00:31:28.481 --> 00:31:29.314
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

762
00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:30.670
<v Speaker 3>if it gets into the later round,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>

763
00:31:30.671 --> 00:31:32.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>her percentage goes down.</v>

764
00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:33.640
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think he or she's going to come</v>

765
00:31:33.641 --> 00:31:34.960
<v Speaker 3>out and she's going to put her foot on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the gas,</v>

766
00:31:34.961 --> 00:31:35.920
<v Speaker 3>empty the tank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the first,</v>

767
00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:37.800
<v Speaker 3>I don't think she's going to be around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's right.</v>

768
00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:41.060
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that fascinating?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those fast twitch muscle fiber fighters,</v>

769
00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:43.820
<v Speaker 1>those ones who explode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the really dynamic ones,</v>

770
00:31:44.690 --> 00:31:46.790
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a fucking given a take to</v>

771
00:31:46.791 --> 00:31:47.690
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

772
00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:49.010
<v Speaker 1>And those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those ones,</v>

773
00:31:49.011 --> 00:31:52.100
<v Speaker 1>they just don't survive into the third,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fourth and fifth round with the same</v>

774
00:31:52.101 --> 00:31:52.660
<v Speaker 1>pep.</v>

775
00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:53.890
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's back up.</v>

776
00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:55.900
<v Speaker 3>I made a note here on that Jon Jones</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

777
00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:59.530
<v Speaker 3>Did you follow the whole johnstones</v>
<v Speaker 3>drama and the most recent one?</v>

778
00:31:59.590 --> 00:32:01.030
<v Speaker 3>The only post drama?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

779
00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:03.400
<v Speaker 3>Was that he had a press conference the</v>
<v Speaker 3>next day.</v>

780
00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:06.040
<v Speaker 3>Did you follow that press conference at</v>
<v Speaker 3>all?</v>

781
00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:08.800
<v Speaker 3>I saw the crying pictures of Jamie sent</v>
<v Speaker 3>them to me.</v>

782
00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:13.060
<v Speaker 3>I went to that press conference and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a couple of takeaways,</v>

783
00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:17.500
<v Speaker 3>and this is all speculative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for this doesn't make John innocent</v>

784
00:32:17.501 --> 00:32:18.250
<v Speaker 3>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

785
00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:19.270
<v Speaker 3>John's guilty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've got,</v>

786
00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:20.410
<v Speaker 3>they've got the stamp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's guilty,</v>

787
00:32:20.411 --> 00:32:22.360
<v Speaker 3>but his actions were not that of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>guilty man.</v>

788
00:32:22.810 --> 00:32:25.060
<v Speaker 3>Historically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>guilty guys go bury their head in the</v>

789
00:32:25.061 --> 00:32:26.680
<v Speaker 3>sand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They tried out run this thing.</v>

790
00:32:26.681 --> 00:32:28.510
<v Speaker 3>They get with their legal teams.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They show up at the hearing.</v>

791
00:32:28.511 --> 00:32:30.460
<v Speaker 3>They hope for the worst,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the best.</v>

792
00:32:30.461 --> 00:32:31.720
<v Speaker 3>They get the worst and they deal with</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

793
00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:34.900
<v Speaker 3>John face the music.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Twelve hours later he came through the</v>

794
00:32:34.901 --> 00:32:37.510
<v Speaker 3>hotel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His whole life's pulling apart right</v>

795
00:32:37.511 --> 00:32:39.140
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I imagine he didn't even sleep that</v>

796
00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:40.580
<v Speaker 3>night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He comes to the hotel with the fans.</v>

797
00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:43.580
<v Speaker 3>He comes into the media pr one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One says,</v>

798
00:32:43.581 --> 00:32:48.581
<v Speaker 3>you read a script that was written for</v>
<v Speaker 3>you and you exit the stage instead.</v>

799
00:32:48.621 --> 00:32:51.230
<v Speaker 3>He read no script,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he took every question asked of him,</v>

800
00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:53.480
<v Speaker 3>and that's just not what a guilty guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>does.</v>

801
00:32:53.481 --> 00:32:56.200
<v Speaker 3>Not understand that he's guilty in terms</v>
<v Speaker 3>of data,</v>

802
00:32:56.220 --> 00:33:01.220
<v Speaker 3>but what we care about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his intent was he trying to get over on</v>

803
00:33:01.221 --> 00:33:02.710
<v Speaker 3>somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was he trying to hide something?</v>

804
00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:04.490
<v Speaker 3>His actions would represent that he did</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

805
00:33:04.491 --> 00:33:06.080
<v Speaker 3>but here's the problem with the press</v>
<v Speaker 3>conference,</v>

806
00:33:06.081 --> 00:33:08.210
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you hold a press conference,</v>

807
00:33:08.770 --> 00:33:11.090
<v Speaker 3>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have one goal in mind which is to</v>

808
00:33:11.091 --> 00:33:14.300
<v Speaker 3>win over the media and that they say</v>
<v Speaker 3>nice things about you before you do go</v>

809
00:33:14.301 --> 00:33:15.890
<v Speaker 3>home and bury your head in the sand.</v>

810
00:33:15.890 --> 00:33:18.260
<v Speaker 3>Secondly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to break something.</v>

811
00:33:18.290 --> 00:33:20.870
<v Speaker 3>You want to get something out there to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get ahead of the store.</v>

812
00:33:20.871 --> 00:33:22.700
<v Speaker 3>That's the whole reason you show up at</v>
<v Speaker 3>these things.</v>

813
00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.530
<v Speaker 3>The only car that he had to play is what</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you test positive for?</v>

814
00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:31.790
<v Speaker 3>That was the only thing we didn't know</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they refuse to reveal it so that</v>

815
00:33:31.791 --> 00:33:36.140
<v Speaker 3>that was a little bit weird and where I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was sitting because I've been in John</v>

816
00:33:36.150 --> 00:33:38.510
<v Speaker 3>spot in here was the thing that happened</v>
<v Speaker 3>with me.</v>

817
00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:40.400
<v Speaker 3>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about John,</v>

818
00:33:40.401 --> 00:33:44.600
<v Speaker 3>this whole thing is going on with John</v>
<v Speaker 3>based on a test that took place on June</v>

819
00:33:44.601 --> 00:33:47.450
<v Speaker 3>16th.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reason that relevant when I went</v>

820
00:33:47.451 --> 00:33:50.920
<v Speaker 3>through my thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was he tested positive for semesters</v>

821
00:33:50.921 --> 00:33:53.150
<v Speaker 3>in blockers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those don't really have anything to do</v>

822
00:33:53.151 --> 00:33:54.280
<v Speaker 3>with anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't help you.</v>

823
00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:57.650
<v Speaker 3>They're silly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you might've just revealed</v>

824
00:33:57.651 --> 00:33:58.040
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

825
00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:00.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He tested positive for two estrogen.</v>

826
00:34:01.370 --> 00:34:03.020
<v Speaker 3>No one else knew that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>

827
00:34:03.021 --> 00:34:06.680
<v Speaker 3>I'm revealing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You broke personal information.</v>

828
00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:08.120
<v Speaker 3>That's what we're doing here though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

829
00:34:08.150 --> 00:34:09.040
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this is like,</v>

830
00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:12.200
<v Speaker 3>this is like the only way that anybody</v>
<v Speaker 3>could find that out is if you talked</v>

831
00:34:12.201 --> 00:34:13.910
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>

832
00:34:13.970 --> 00:34:14.840
<v Speaker 3>It's out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

833
00:34:14.841 --> 00:34:16.010
<v Speaker 3>And that we're doing here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't we?</v>

834
00:34:16.011 --> 00:34:18.560
<v Speaker 3>Creating some news.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a big news day,</v>

835
00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:21.230
<v Speaker 3>but let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but here's The relevance and let me tie</v>

836
00:34:21.231 --> 00:34:23.060
<v Speaker 3>myself into this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I went through this job,</v>

837
00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:25.010
<v Speaker 3>I had something selling in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

838
00:34:25.011 --> 00:34:27.830
<v Speaker 3>I had an estrogen blocker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have something silly in there and</v>

839
00:34:27.890 --> 00:34:29.150
<v Speaker 3>everybody forgave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was.</v>

840
00:34:29.210 --> 00:34:31.100
<v Speaker 3>I was going to be suspended,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but fox,</v>

841
00:34:31.101 --> 00:34:32.850
<v Speaker 3>every I was fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody looked good.</v>

842
00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:33.291
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

843
00:34:33.291 --> 00:34:34.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we changed the rules in the test and</v>

844
00:34:34.761 --> 00:34:36.380
<v Speaker 3>everything was fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what I had to live with,</v>

845
00:34:37.090 --> 00:34:40.370
<v Speaker 3>what only I knew there was another test</v>
<v Speaker 3>out there,</v>

846
00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:44.190
<v Speaker 3>but the results hadn't come back yet and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know what that test was going</v>

847
00:34:44.191 --> 00:34:44.450
<v Speaker 3>to show.</v>

848
00:34:44.450 --> 00:34:47.270
<v Speaker 3>I know what it could have shown.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what it should have shown,</v>

849
00:34:47.271 --> 00:34:48.680
<v Speaker 3>but I know what the other test could</v>
<v Speaker 3>have been,</v>

850
00:34:48.681 --> 00:34:51.110
<v Speaker 3>should have as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're sitting there hoping,</v>

851
00:34:51.111 --> 00:34:53.540
<v Speaker 3>how good is this damn test?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all you're thinking about.</v>

852
00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:53.960
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

853
00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:58.310
<v Speaker 3>you and I had a conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're the guy called you on stage and</v>

854
00:34:58.311 --> 00:34:59.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm blowing you up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

855
00:34:59.391 --> 00:35:00.620
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing a show.</v>

856
00:35:00.621 --> 00:35:04.640
<v Speaker 3>Can I call you tomorrow tonight?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will stay in capital letters tonight.</v>

857
00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:06.790
<v Speaker 3>I need to hear from you tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

858
00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:08.480
<v Speaker 3>I remember the exact words.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

859
00:35:08.481 --> 00:35:09.231
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

860
00:35:09.231 --> 00:35:12.950
<v Speaker 3>we were wondering how stringent these</v>
<v Speaker 3>new tests are.</v>

861
00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:15.710
<v Speaker 3>Turns out they're really good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Turns out it's a pretty good test.</v>

862
00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:19.520
<v Speaker 3>Turns out it's not like the old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a one,</v>

863
00:35:19.521 --> 00:35:21.860
<v Speaker 3>800 requests a test that costs $99.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

864
00:35:21.861 --> 00:35:24.470
<v Speaker 3>There's a reason this ca,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this test is 40 plus grand,</v>

865
00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:26.440
<v Speaker 3>but the thing that I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

866
00:35:26.490 --> 00:35:29.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does John have another test out there?</v>

867
00:35:29.721 --> 00:35:31.310
<v Speaker 3>If he does it doesn't mean it's going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>come back,</v>

868
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:35.390
<v Speaker 3>but that was the same spot I was in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a shoe that could drop for me.</v>

869
00:35:35.391 --> 00:35:36.980
<v Speaker 3>It did for him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there another test out there?</v>

870
00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:38.070
<v Speaker 3>And if there's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the facade</v>

871
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:41.430
<v Speaker 2>has got some explaining to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're telling me a guy that's got a</v>

872
00:35:41.431 --> 00:35:44.090
<v Speaker 2>track record,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tested positive for cocaine going to</v>

873
00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:46.860
<v Speaker 2>fight in the biggest fight of his career</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the last time you tested them was</v>

874
00:35:46.861 --> 00:35:48.420
<v Speaker 2>one month before the bout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then it was.</v>

875
00:35:48.421 --> 00:35:51.930
<v Speaker 2>Sod has got some explaining to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's more to the story now.</v>

876
00:35:51.931 --> 00:35:53.610
<v Speaker 2>What do we hear it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does he pass his,</v>

877
00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:54.930
<v Speaker 2>the end up in the spot?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

878
00:35:54.931 --> 00:35:57.000
<v Speaker 2>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the piece that's still missing.</v>

879
00:35:57.270 --> 00:36:00.240
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's one aspect to his,</v>

880
00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:02.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>test is positive test that people are</v>

881
00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:08.030
<v Speaker 1>saying could possibly play a factor and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a supplements that he could</v>

882
00:36:08.761 --> 00:36:12.160
<v Speaker 1>possibly have been taking something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

883
00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:15.110
<v Speaker 1>this is what happened to 10 means this</v>
<v Speaker 1>is what happened to um,</v>

884
00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:20.100
<v Speaker 1>allow Ramiro where they get a supplement</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it says it has a bunch of stuff on</v>

885
00:36:20.101 --> 00:36:21.810
<v Speaker 1>it says you look through the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ingredients.</v>

886
00:36:21.811 --> 00:36:23.390
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Creatine [inaudible],</v>

887
00:36:23.410 --> 00:36:24.330
<v Speaker 1>we're good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're good.</v>

888
00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:27.630
<v Speaker 1>But then when you run it through a lab,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it turns out there's a bunch of other</v>

889
00:36:27.631 --> 00:36:31.530
<v Speaker 1>stuff in there too and that's why it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>so effective and that's why it sells.</v>

890
00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:34.380
<v Speaker 1>So it is possible that that could be the</v>
<v Speaker 1>case.</v>

891
00:36:34.530 --> 00:36:39.120
<v Speaker 1>We don't know yet because then if that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>the case then John has to give them all</v>

892
00:36:39.121 --> 00:36:42.330
<v Speaker 1>the supplements that he was taking and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they have to go to a store,</v>

893
00:36:42.331 --> 00:36:45.300
<v Speaker 1>buy them independently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>test them and verify that these</v>

894
00:36:45.301 --> 00:36:47.140
<v Speaker 1>ingredients were in not just the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bachelor,</v>

895
00:36:47.141 --> 00:36:49.620
<v Speaker 1>the hands them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also in other batches.</v>

896
00:36:49.621 --> 00:36:51.750
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like he doctor did show some</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff in there.</v>

897
00:36:51.810 --> 00:36:54.840
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But estrogen blockers are usually when</v>

898
00:36:54.841 --> 00:36:56.550
<v Speaker 1>people are getting off of steroids,</v>

899
00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:58.230
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you're coming off a cycle,</v>

900
00:36:58.490 --> 00:36:59.580
<v Speaker 2>it's a blocker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

901
00:36:59.581 --> 00:37:01.770
<v Speaker 2>men don't want estrogen anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a blocker.</v>

902
00:37:01.771 --> 00:37:04.200
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as far as that substance goes,</v>

903
00:37:04.201 --> 00:37:06.150
<v Speaker 2>and that's all that's all he's going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to live with.</v>

904
00:37:06.151 --> 00:37:09.510
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to have to explain how</v>
<v Speaker 2>they work for someone who doesn't</v>

905
00:37:09.511 --> 00:37:13.240
<v Speaker 2>understand what an estrogen blocker will</v>
<v Speaker 2>do if you up your testosterone than your</v>

906
00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:15.930
<v Speaker 2>estrogens has naturally ups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And guys don't want estrogen.</v>

907
00:37:15.931 --> 00:37:16.764
<v Speaker 2>So if you're a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

908
00:37:16.770 --> 00:37:19.370
<v Speaker 2>you take a blocker that can block that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring it to you,</v>

909
00:37:19.371 --> 00:37:20.830
<v Speaker 2>you won't get a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

910
00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:25.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to think of a word Guy Gasta.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't even.</v>

911
00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:27.930
<v Speaker 2>I can't bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tits is all that comes to mind.</v>

912
00:37:27.931 --> 00:37:30.030
<v Speaker 2>I can't think of the word guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a guy.</v>

913
00:37:30.031 --> 00:37:33.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm more closed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guy Got a go.</v>

914
00:37:33.330 --> 00:37:35.190
<v Speaker 2>At any rate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can stop some of those things.</v>

915
00:37:35.191 --> 00:37:38.670
<v Speaker 2>So that's the speculation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason that that's on the list</v>

916
00:37:38.671 --> 00:37:41.430
<v Speaker 2>is they find that that's a way they can</v>
<v Speaker 2>catch you after the fact,</v>

917
00:37:41.431 --> 00:37:42.600
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we missed you during this cycle,</v>

918
00:37:42.601 --> 00:37:43.434
<v Speaker 2>we can catch you here.</v>

919
00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:44.390
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just that.</v>

920
00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:49.100
<v Speaker 1>The reason why they take it after the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cycle is because you get hypogonadism,</v>

921
00:37:49.101 --> 00:37:49.530
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

922
00:37:49.530 --> 00:37:53.720
<v Speaker 1>your body stops producing testosterone</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you took exoticness</v>

923
00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:54.980
<v Speaker 1>testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

924
00:37:55.010 --> 00:37:56.540
<v Speaker 1>And so the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To restart it,</v>

925
00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:59.630
<v Speaker 1>they'd take this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these estrogen blockers.</v>

926
00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:00.623
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

927
00:38:00.690 --> 00:38:03.480
<v Speaker 2>I tested positive for an estrogen</v>
<v Speaker 2>blocker and it was that exact thing.</v>

928
00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:04.830
<v Speaker 2>Same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They banned testosterone.</v>

929
00:38:04.831 --> 00:38:09.360
<v Speaker 2>I went on something called Hcg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She'll return your testes back on and</v>

930
00:38:09.361 --> 00:38:13.020
<v Speaker 2>then you have to clomiphene,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is by definition an estrogen</v>

931
00:38:13.021 --> 00:38:16.440
<v Speaker 2>blocker for that same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it can also help get your body going</v>

932
00:38:16.441 --> 00:38:18.450
<v Speaker 2>back on testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're band.</v>

933
00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:19.890
<v Speaker 2>John's got a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

934
00:38:19.891 --> 00:38:21.720
<v Speaker 2>this goes back to the press conference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

935
00:38:21.721 --> 00:38:25.770
<v Speaker 2>I have not taken anything new that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>have not taken my entire career.</v>

936
00:38:26.070 --> 00:38:27.840
<v Speaker 2>So somebody gave him a follow up</v>
<v Speaker 2>question.</v>

937
00:38:27.841 --> 00:38:29.880
<v Speaker 2>He quickly realized what he just said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>

938
00:38:29.881 --> 00:38:31.860
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do have a new supplement company.</v>

939
00:38:31.861 --> 00:38:35.040
<v Speaker 2>I have taken some new supplements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he realized,</v>

940
00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:37.030
<v Speaker 2>put himself in one point needed to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of it.</v>

941
00:38:37.330 --> 00:38:41.020
<v Speaker 2>The supplement company then who dropped</v>
<v Speaker 2>him immediately came out with a press</v>

942
00:38:41.021 --> 00:38:42.790
<v Speaker 2>release that do not put this on us.</v>

943
00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:45.730
<v Speaker 2>We don't have anything to do with that</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we'll turn over any samples you want</v>

944
00:38:45.731 --> 00:38:48.040
<v Speaker 2>so that that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the downside to holding a press</v>

945
00:38:48.041 --> 00:38:50.530
<v Speaker 2>conference is if there's anything that</v>
<v Speaker 2>commission hates,</v>

946
00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:52.840
<v Speaker 2>it's when somebody isn't honest with</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

947
00:38:52.841 --> 00:38:54.580
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there's anything who a hates and it's</v>

948
00:38:54.581 --> 00:38:59.581
<v Speaker 2>with Lance Armstrong found out it's when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you deny the scientific accuracy of</v>

949
00:38:59.621 --> 00:39:03.370
<v Speaker 2>their test,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the risk with holding a press</v>

950
00:39:03.371 --> 00:39:06.070
<v Speaker 2>conference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why most legal teams will tell</v>

951
00:39:06.071 --> 00:39:07.240
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go home,</v>

952
00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:09.880
<v Speaker 2>be quiet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rewrite right to remain silent,</v>

953
00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.040
<v Speaker 2>execute that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Show up at your hearing date,</v>

954
00:39:12.041 --> 00:39:13.480
<v Speaker 2>gets sworn in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say your piece,</v>

955
00:39:13.481 --> 00:39:13.910
<v Speaker 2>and then go ahead</v>

956
00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:18.110
<v Speaker 1>about your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does John not have a trusted</v>

957
00:39:18.111 --> 00:39:22.070
<v Speaker 1>handler?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does John not have someone who</v>

958
00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:25.820
<v Speaker 1>realizes that you don't just have like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

959
00:39:25.950 --> 00:39:28.220
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a high level athlete?</v>

960
00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:31.550
<v Speaker 1>You have arguably the greatest light</v>
<v Speaker 1>heavyweight of all time,</v>

961
00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:32.960
<v Speaker 1>who has not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>

962
00:39:32.961 --> 00:39:37.100
<v Speaker 1>reached its potential yet I think John</v>
<v Speaker 1>has massive potential outside of what</v>

963
00:39:37.101 --> 00:39:40.610
<v Speaker 1>he's actually shown because when he</v>
<v Speaker 1>moved to Albuquerque and we saw that he</v>

964
00:39:40.611 --> 00:39:43.760
<v Speaker 1>was training all the time and we saw the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most recent footage before he fought</v>

965
00:39:43.761 --> 00:39:47.600
<v Speaker 1>over in St prue waste power lifting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looks fucking huge.</v>

966
00:39:47.690 --> 00:39:49.640
<v Speaker 1>He's dedicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His eating clean.</v>

967
00:39:49.641 --> 00:39:52.490
<v Speaker 1>He's making these instagram videos of</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this healthy food he's eating.</v>

968
00:39:52.730 --> 00:39:54.400
<v Speaker 1>We're assuming he's getting the proper</v>
<v Speaker 1>rest.</v>

969
00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:56.480
<v Speaker 1>All the other things we're assuming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get the wild man.</v>

970
00:39:56.481 --> 00:39:58.310
<v Speaker 1>Days are gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's still got the wild man's mind,</v>

971
00:39:58.430 --> 00:40:01.760
<v Speaker 1>but now he's gonna approach this like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>real competitive athlete.</v>

972
00:40:01.850 --> 00:40:06.350
<v Speaker 1>Here's my question to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When someone is wild and talented and</v>

973
00:40:06.351 --> 00:40:09.110
<v Speaker 1>impulsive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a wild motherfucker like Jon Jones</v>

974
00:40:09.111 --> 00:40:11.490
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it even smart terrain,</v>

975
00:40:11.570 --> 00:40:14.750
<v Speaker 1>that guy in Ken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can it affect him?</v>

976
00:40:15.090 --> 00:40:17.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it a positive thing to read them in</v>

977
00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:22.870
<v Speaker 1>or is part of what he is and why he's so</v>
<v Speaker 1>good and why he's willing to open with a</v>

978
00:40:23.811 --> 00:40:27.800
<v Speaker 1>flying knee on a shogun was the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

979
00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:30.260
<v Speaker 1>The first fight for a title,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was he?</v>

980
00:40:30.261 --> 00:40:31.970
<v Speaker 1>Twenty three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>24,</v>

981
00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:34.940
<v Speaker 1>20.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He opens up with a flying knee on,</v>

982
00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:37.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the legends of MMA,</v>

983
00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:42.040
<v Speaker 1>former pride champion or fry pride,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Grand Prix tramp champion and UFC</v>

984
00:40:42.141 --> 00:40:43.320
<v Speaker 1>champion as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll,</v>

985
00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:48.230
<v Speaker 1>you'll look at a guy like John in the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way he competes in the way he's.</v>

986
00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:51.710
<v Speaker 1>He's so creative and wild in there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>impulsive.</v>

987
00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:54.620
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like that's a part of his</v>
<v Speaker 1>success.</v>

988
00:40:54.930 --> 00:40:57.240
<v Speaker 2>I fully agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And historically I could bring up</v>

989
00:40:57.241 --> 00:41:00.180
<v Speaker 2>athletes where that is true or they go</v>
<v Speaker 2>sober where they go straight and narrow</v>

990
00:41:00.181 --> 00:41:02.730
<v Speaker 2>when they find God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever these things are in,</v>

991
00:41:02.731 --> 00:41:07.050
<v Speaker 2>they changed something that yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dominoes start to fall.</v>

992
00:41:07.051 --> 00:41:09.420
<v Speaker 2>The problem is when you've got a wild</v>
<v Speaker 2>man like John,</v>

993
00:41:10.290 --> 00:41:13.420
<v Speaker 2>he's in a box and it's a loose box and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's having some fights,</v>

994
00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:17.670
<v Speaker 2>but usually that continues to escalate</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he kinda needs to keep himself right</v>

995
00:41:17.671 --> 00:41:21.120
<v Speaker 2>in that framework.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the bad news is it usually just</v>

996
00:41:21.121 --> 00:41:23.400
<v Speaker 2>keeps get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just usually just keeps pushing.</v>

997
00:41:23.401 --> 00:41:25.380
<v Speaker 2>So that's a very important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That becomes a problem.</v>

998
00:41:25.381 --> 00:41:25.660
<v Speaker 2>That's</v>

999
00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:28.840
<v Speaker 1>a very important point where people</v>
<v Speaker 1>escalate things like billionaires want</v>

1000
00:41:28.841 --> 00:41:29.860
<v Speaker 1>more billions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1001
00:41:29.890 --> 00:41:33.070
<v Speaker 1>They want islands now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want fucking jets and spaceships</v>

1002
00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:34.120
<v Speaker 1>and with</v>

1003
00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:38.330
<v Speaker 4>a pro athlete or a wild person who's</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing crazy shit,</v>

1004
00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:41.840
<v Speaker 4>they want to do more crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They want to drive 150 miles an hour.</v>

1005
00:41:42.110 --> 00:41:46.550
<v Speaker 4>They want a man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it just seems like whatever the fuck</v>

1006
00:41:46.551 --> 00:41:49.190
<v Speaker 4>you do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nerf everything around him,</v>

1007
00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:51.380
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by up the town.</v>

1008
00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:55.820
<v Speaker 4>Fucking have three guys that he trusts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>followed him around everywhere and make</v>

1009
00:41:55.821 --> 00:41:57.890
<v Speaker 4>sure that he doesn't eat anything that</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's not supposed to eat.</v>

1010
00:41:58.310 --> 00:41:59.930
<v Speaker 4>Don't take any pills you're not supposed</v>
<v Speaker 4>to take.</v>

1011
00:41:59.931 --> 00:42:02.030
<v Speaker 4>Don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most of us don't drive.</v>

1012
00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:05.300
<v Speaker 4>I mean that was his biggest problem was</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting behind the wheel in front of</v>

1013
00:42:05.301 --> 00:42:06.770
<v Speaker 4>everything else he was doing was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>John,</v>

1014
00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:08.470
<v Speaker 4>you gotta get you gotTa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Get a chauffer,</v>

1015
00:42:08.490 --> 00:42:10.040
<v Speaker 4>you got to get uber.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can take a taxi.</v>

1016
00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:13.160
<v Speaker 4>Don't get behind the wheel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was the most of his problems.</v>

1017
00:42:13.161 --> 00:42:15.110
<v Speaker 4>He had some other ones,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that was the most of it.</v>

1018
00:42:15.110 --> 00:42:17.330
<v Speaker 4>If you just took him out of the driver's</v>
<v Speaker 4>seat.</v>

1019
00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:19.340
<v Speaker 4>A lot of this doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1020
00:42:19.341 --> 00:42:22.370
<v Speaker 4>a lot of it doesn't exist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this most recent one obviously does</v>

1021
00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:23.750
<v Speaker 4>and the like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1022
00:42:23.751 --> 00:42:26.690
<v Speaker 4>He had those.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The two major car accidents,</v>

1023
00:42:26.691 --> 00:42:31.691
<v Speaker 4>we had that beautiful Bentley and slid</v>
<v Speaker 4>it into a tree and then obviously the</v>

1024
00:42:31.941 --> 00:42:34.520
<v Speaker 4>one where he crashed and that woman and</v>
<v Speaker 4>left the scene of the crime,</v>

1025
00:42:34.521 --> 00:42:37.520
<v Speaker 4>which was horrendous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He survived that though.</v>

1026
00:42:37.830 --> 00:42:39.700
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he vibe that he came back and the urban</v>

1027
00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:41.030
<v Speaker 4>st prue fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He Won.</v>

1028
00:42:41.070 --> 00:42:45.710
<v Speaker 4>They beat a top six guy on short notice</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then this happens.</v>

1029
00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:51.130
<v Speaker 4>And to get positive on something as</v>
<v Speaker 4>small and innocuous as estrogen</v>

1030
00:42:51.711 --> 00:42:53.410
<v Speaker 4>blockers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1031
00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:55.250
<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you go back to that open state</v>

1032
00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:58.160
<v Speaker 4>approved fight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>single worst performances of a</v>

1033
00:42:58.390 --> 00:43:02.090
<v Speaker 4>performance of John's career,</v>
<v Speaker 4>single worst by light years.</v>

1034
00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:03.650
<v Speaker 4>They.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You break it down a little further.</v>

1035
00:43:03.650 --> 00:43:05.230
<v Speaker 4>He won the grappling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he won the striking.</v>

1036
00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:06.620
<v Speaker 4>He won every round.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He did it.</v>

1037
00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:08.570
<v Speaker 4>He did it back off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You didn't get tired.</v>

1038
00:43:08.571 --> 00:43:11.000
<v Speaker 4>He was stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that was on a bad day.</v>

1039
00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:12.770
<v Speaker 4>I didn't think it was a bad fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1040
00:43:12.771 --> 00:43:14.300
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone says the single worst</v>

1041
00:43:14.301 --> 00:43:17.960
<v Speaker 4>performance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a great deal of respect for St</v>

1042
00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:21.920
<v Speaker 4>prue and I think [inaudible] is a very</v>
<v Speaker 4>dangerous guy.</v>

1043
00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:26.060
<v Speaker 4>He's very explosive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His left power kick is extremely strong.</v>

1044
00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:29.930
<v Speaker 4>He has a nasty left hook.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a southpaw and he fights odd.</v>

1045
00:43:29.931 --> 00:43:33.460
<v Speaker 4>He has a very odd style.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would agree about opens.</v>

1046
00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:36.230
<v Speaker 4>I think your assessment there is fair</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think his stock went up that</v>

1047
00:43:36.231 --> 00:43:37.280
<v Speaker 4>night,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when I'm watching John,</v>

1048
00:43:37.281 --> 00:43:37.791
<v Speaker 4>I'm going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1049
00:43:37.791 --> 00:43:39.650
<v Speaker 4>this isn't that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a rusty John.</v>

1050
00:43:39.651 --> 00:43:41.780
<v Speaker 4>This is slow or the outputs a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 4>down.</v>

1051
00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:45.590
<v Speaker 4>The bottom line is on a bad day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he left with a world championship on a</v>

1052
00:43:45.591 --> 00:43:45.740
<v Speaker 4>bed.</v>

1053
00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:48.320
<v Speaker 4>That's how good he is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The other side of John,</v>

1054
00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:51.200
<v Speaker 4>you know when you're talking about the</v>
<v Speaker 4>car wrecks or one more time about the</v>

1055
00:43:51.201 --> 00:43:52.880
<v Speaker 4>cocaine or what he's going through now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and again,</v>

1056
00:43:52.881 --> 00:43:54.440
<v Speaker 4>this was my takeaway from the press</v>
<v Speaker 4>conference.</v>

1057
00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:59.120
<v Speaker 4>The biggest takeaway was John won't own</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything and it's like John,</v>

1058
00:43:59.121 --> 00:44:02.060
<v Speaker 4>at some point you can't do the routine</v>
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>

1059
00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:04.070
<v Speaker 4>I don't know why God put me in this</v>
<v Speaker 4>spot.</v>

1060
00:44:04.071 --> 00:44:06.320
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know why God put me in the spot.</v>

1061
00:44:06.321 --> 00:44:08.360
<v Speaker 4>Everything happens for a reason.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to come out better.</v>

1062
00:44:08.361 --> 00:44:09.470
<v Speaker 4>On the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like John,</v>

1063
00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:13.370
<v Speaker 4>you're acting like you got diagnosed</v>
<v Speaker 4>with diabetes or cancer or something.</v>

1064
00:44:13.371 --> 00:44:15.650
<v Speaker 4>You know that you're the victim.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You weren't a hit and run.</v>

1065
00:44:15.651 --> 00:44:17.240
<v Speaker 4>You did the hidden and you did the</v>
<v Speaker 4>running.</v>

1066
00:44:17.241 --> 00:44:19.250
<v Speaker 4>That was your fault on the cocaine</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

1067
00:44:19.251 --> 00:44:20.850
<v Speaker 4>You didn't say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody slipped me a mickey.</v>

1068
00:44:20.850 --> 00:44:23.330
<v Speaker 4>You said I was at a party in Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a rolled up 100 and went down to the</v>

1069
00:44:23.331 --> 00:44:24.350
<v Speaker 4>tip.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was your fault.</v>

1070
00:44:24.830 --> 00:44:28.200
<v Speaker 4>Now you're in a jam here for two banned</v>
<v Speaker 4>substance in.</v>

1071
00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:30.980
<v Speaker 4>You're still not taking response and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>think God's put you in this spot.</v>

1072
00:44:30.990 --> 00:44:32.940
<v Speaker 4>It's like John said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you put yourself in this spot and at</v>

1073
00:44:32.941 --> 00:44:35.130
<v Speaker 4>some point if you're the baddest dude in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the world and you are,</v>

1074
00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:38.100
<v Speaker 4>you gotta man up on these things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to man up and go,</v>

1075
00:44:38.101 --> 00:44:39.930
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm guilty and I how exactly it</v>

1076
00:44:39.931 --> 00:44:41.640
<v Speaker 4>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to try to figure that out,</v>

1077
00:44:42.090 --> 00:44:44.130
<v Speaker 4>but I'm definitely guilty of Sada does a</v>
<v Speaker 4>good job.</v>

1078
00:44:44.131 --> 00:44:46.320
<v Speaker 4>I trust those labs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's get to the bottom of the jail.</v>

1079
00:44:46.321 --> 00:44:49.590
<v Speaker 4>Son In public relations is what we need.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We need a need,</v>

1080
00:44:49.591 --> 00:44:51.960
<v Speaker 4>a little earpiece.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You put in John Jones ear,</v>

1081
00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:53.430
<v Speaker 4>you sit behind the screens.</v>

1082
00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:55.030
<v Speaker 4>You have a monitor here you go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1083
00:44:55.031 --> 00:44:55.331
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1084
00:44:55.331 --> 00:44:55.681
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

1085
00:44:55.681 --> 00:44:56.730
<v Speaker 4>John,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is not.</v>

1086
00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:58.920
<v Speaker 4>Just stop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stop right there.</v>

1087
00:44:59.330 --> 00:45:01.260
<v Speaker 4>But no more victim.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No more victim role.</v>

1088
00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:04.170
<v Speaker 4>You stand up like Tony Montana and that</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking restaurant.</v>

1089
00:45:04.350 --> 00:45:06.840
<v Speaker 4>You're looking at the bad guy there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Say Hello.</v>

1090
00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:10.020
<v Speaker 4>There it is through her bag guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1091
00:45:10.021 --> 00:45:11.220
<v Speaker 4>I like to party.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bitch,</v>

1092
00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:12.720
<v Speaker 4>I fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I took some shit.</v>

1093
00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:16.620
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what supplements would have</v>

1094
00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:19.710
<v Speaker 4>testosterone blockers or estrogen</v>
<v Speaker 4>blockers excuse,</v>

1095
00:45:19.711 --> 00:45:21.940
<v Speaker 4>but none that I've ever heard of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>

1096
00:45:22.330 --> 00:45:23.163
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you're there,</v>

1097
00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:26.760
<v Speaker 4>but if they boost testosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>estrogen blockers,</v>

1098
00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:30.390
<v Speaker 4>apparently the is more of an effect of</v>
<v Speaker 4>testosterone.</v>

1099
00:45:30.391 --> 00:45:32.250
<v Speaker 4>How's it work?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never heard that.</v>

1100
00:45:32.251 --> 00:45:33.180
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that could be true.</v>

1101
00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:37.020
<v Speaker 4>I think of myself as kind of an expert</v>
<v Speaker 4>in this field from being on the wrong</v>

1102
00:45:37.021 --> 00:45:38.640
<v Speaker 4>side,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but on both sides of it.</v>

1103
00:45:38.641 --> 00:45:39.500
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1104
00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:41.010
<v Speaker 4>I've never heard of that.</v>

1105
00:45:41.010 --> 00:45:42.840
<v Speaker 4>I can't imagine why supplement company</v>
<v Speaker 4>would do that.</v>

1106
00:45:42.841 --> 00:45:46.470
<v Speaker 4>And this supplement company wasn't like</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tim means it's company or Yo El Ramirez,</v>

1107
00:45:46.471 --> 00:45:48.660
<v Speaker 4>they came out with a press release</v>
<v Speaker 4>instantly,</v>

1108
00:45:48.810 --> 00:45:51.870
<v Speaker 4>so do not put this on us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let us know what you need from us.</v>

1109
00:45:51.871 --> 00:45:54.240
<v Speaker 4>We'll drop it off at the lab ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jamie,</v>

1110
00:45:54.241 --> 00:45:58.110
<v Speaker 4>see if you find this online because</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone told me about it this weekend</v>

1111
00:45:58.111 --> 00:46:01.410
<v Speaker 4>and I never got a chance to look at.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Someone said that there are certain</v>

1112
00:46:01.411 --> 00:46:06.411
<v Speaker 4>things in supplements that you know</v>
<v Speaker 4>could have been sold by a company that</v>

1113
00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:11.310
<v Speaker 4>would allow you to test positive for</v>
<v Speaker 4>these very things.</v>

1114
00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:13.690
<v Speaker 4>See if.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See if you could find that in,</v>

1115
00:46:13.750 --> 00:46:17.580
<v Speaker 4>in relationship to John Jones is test</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I remember someone talking about</v>

1116
00:46:17.581 --> 00:46:19.410
<v Speaker 4>it and I said I gotta remember to look</v>
<v Speaker 4>this up.</v>

1117
00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:23.550
<v Speaker 4>What it's owned there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Only those two chemicals.</v>

1118
00:46:23.551 --> 00:46:26.580
<v Speaker 4>The only exists like in a pharmaceutical</v>
<v Speaker 4>world,</v>

1119
00:46:26.610 --> 00:46:26.930
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1120
00:46:26.930 --> 00:46:27.763
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's right.</v>

1121
00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:31.310
<v Speaker 4>So it's not like it's a root or</v>
<v Speaker 4>something and you know.</v>

1122
00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:34.140
<v Speaker 4>And then what exactly they got upon me</v>
<v Speaker 4>that that's still coming out.</v>

1123
00:46:34.141 --> 00:46:35.280
<v Speaker 4>But that was one of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

1124
00:46:35.281 --> 00:46:37.140
<v Speaker 4>to go back to the press conference and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>think,</v>

1125
00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:40.260
<v Speaker 4>I think John did more good than he did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was kind of a good thing that</v>

1126
00:46:40.261 --> 00:46:41.370
<v Speaker 4>he came out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He showed courage.</v>

1127
00:46:41.371 --> 00:46:42.990
<v Speaker 4>He didn't read the script,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he answered all the questions,</v>

1128
00:46:43.710 --> 00:46:48.000
<v Speaker 4>but the bad was he didn't tell us what</v>
<v Speaker 4>he tested positive for the bad news.</v>

1129
00:46:48.030 --> 00:46:50.240
<v Speaker 4>Now we stuck with speculation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If he wouldn't come out and tell us</v>

1130
00:46:50.250 --> 00:46:52.350
<v Speaker 4>exactly what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you and I wouldn't have to gas and go to</v>

1131
00:46:52.351 --> 00:46:54.840
<v Speaker 4>the Internet and Springfield and</v>
<v Speaker 4>speculate and rumors is which.</v>

1132
00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:58.380
<v Speaker 4>Which you don't need.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know why he held that with</v>

1133
00:46:58.530 --> 00:47:00.550
<v Speaker 4>understanding who god is going to tell</v>
<v Speaker 4>us.</v>

1134
00:47:01.090 --> 00:47:03.000
<v Speaker 4>Tell us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they know.</v>

1135
00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:03.541
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>

1136
00:47:03.541 --> 00:47:05.850
<v Speaker 4>I really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think if they're gonna charge him and</v>

1137
00:47:05.851 --> 00:47:08.640
<v Speaker 4>they keep getting sued,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have they're going to charge them and</v>

1138
00:47:08.641 --> 00:47:10.040
<v Speaker 4>they are within the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1139
00:47:10.050 --> 00:47:13.620
<v Speaker 4>that I'm going for breaking one year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like medical information.</v>

1140
00:47:13.621 --> 00:47:16.050
<v Speaker 4>You'll take it out of it's medical</v>
<v Speaker 4>information.</v>

1141
00:47:16.110 --> 00:47:19.330
<v Speaker 4>I suppose you're right with Hipaa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this doesn't fall under that.</v>

1142
00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:22.770
<v Speaker 4>The commission's going to bring charges</v>
<v Speaker 4>against him for certain supplements.</v>

1143
00:47:22.771 --> 00:47:24.660
<v Speaker 4>They're going to bring him in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>require that he's there,</v>

1144
00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:27.510
<v Speaker 4>they're going to have to address it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then he's going to say his piece.</v>

1145
00:47:27.511 --> 00:47:28.141
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I took this.</v>

1146
00:47:28.141 --> 00:47:29.980
<v Speaker 4>I didn't think I'd get caught or I don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>know anything</v>

1147
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:30.670
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Guys go as well,</v>

1149
00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:33.970

<v Speaker 3>come out.</v>

1150
00:47:33.971 --> 00:47:38.320

1151
00:47:38.321 --> 00:47:41.260
<v Speaker 3>guess as to how it got an assistant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he is going to take that path.</v>

1152
00:47:41.290 --> 00:47:44.410
<v Speaker 3>The outright denial path.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not a great one historically,</v>

1153
00:47:44.770 --> 00:47:46.510
<v Speaker 3>but some guys taking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if that's the route,</v>

1154
00:47:46.511 --> 00:47:49.630
<v Speaker 3>he's going to go to an outright denial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tell us what it is.</v>

00:52:45.110 --> 00:52:46.220
<v Speaker 1>first one that came,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

1259
00:52:46.221 --> 00:52:47.390
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1260
00:52:47.391 --> 00:52:49.790
<v Speaker 1>So this is just by that company we don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1261
00:52:49.940 --> 00:52:52.070
<v Speaker 1>but none of these things are estrogen</v>
<v Speaker 1>blockers,</v>

1262
00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:56.450
<v Speaker 1>so it doesn't make sense unless he got a</v>
<v Speaker 1>tainted supplement,</v>

1263
00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:59.180
<v Speaker 1>which again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is not the fault of the</v>

1264
00:52:59.181 --> 00:53:02.060
<v Speaker 1>company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>happens all the time because the way a</v>

1265
00:53:02.061 --> 00:53:05.570
<v Speaker 1>supplement company works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like say if you wanted to buy a creatine</v>

1266
00:53:05.571 --> 00:53:09.650
<v Speaker 1>or something from a company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you buy it in bulk from a supplier and</v>

1267
00:53:09.651 --> 00:53:12.650
<v Speaker 1>that supplier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might be in China or who knows</v>

1268
00:53:12.651 --> 00:53:15.110
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they mix these things up and they</v>

1269
00:53:15.111 --> 00:53:19.550
<v Speaker 1>use the same Vat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that was the Anderson Silva Story.</v>

1270
00:53:19.551 --> 00:53:24.500
<v Speaker 1>That was his alibi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that he was buying liquid cialis and</v>

1271
00:53:24.501 --> 00:53:29.501
<v Speaker 1>he was buying from a company that also</v>
<v Speaker 1>sold steroids and apparently according</v>

1272
00:53:30.991 --> 00:53:33.570
<v Speaker 1>to people that know him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is actually what happened,</v>

1273
00:53:34.110 --> 00:53:35.100
<v Speaker 1>which sounds crazy.</v>

1274
00:53:35.460 --> 00:53:37.080
<v Speaker 3>Very well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he and he had three.</v>

1275
00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:39.090
<v Speaker 3>He had three.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He tests positive for three things.</v>

1276
00:53:39.091 --> 00:53:42.170
<v Speaker 3>So maybe that knocks one off the list,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

1277
00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:44.280
<v Speaker 3>I hear you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is some confusion there.</v>

1278
00:53:44.370 --> 00:53:45.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1279
00:53:45.780 --> 00:53:47.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean that story is bs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I hear what you're saying.</v>

1280
00:53:47.791 --> 00:53:49.380
<v Speaker 3>There is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is confusion in there.</v>

1281
00:53:49.381 --> 00:53:51.420
<v Speaker 3>Tim Means was innocent 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1282
00:53:51.421 --> 00:53:53.760
<v Speaker 3>And Yoel Romero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they ruled that.</v>

1283
00:53:53.761 --> 00:53:55.340
<v Speaker 3>That's not my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They ruled the World</v>

1284
00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:56.310
<v Speaker 1>Ramiro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1285
00:53:56.311 --> 00:53:58.920
<v Speaker 1>you want to talk about not passing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>smell test.</v>

1286
00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:04.360
<v Speaker 1>That guy is a goddamn freak of nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen a guy he out of all the</v>

1287
00:54:04.681 --> 00:54:06.930
<v Speaker 1>other freaks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he makes the other freaks look.</v>

1288
00:54:07.230 --> 00:54:09.480
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Frank Mir appear.</v>

1289
00:54:09.481 --> 00:54:11.730
<v Speaker 3>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a weird one to even their own</v>

1290
00:54:11.731 --> 00:54:14.100
<v Speaker 3>science.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're confused on Frank Mirs because</v>

1291
00:54:14.101 --> 00:54:16.750
<v Speaker 3>there's metabolites were so low where</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going,</v>

1292
00:54:16.751 --> 00:54:17.041
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

1293
00:54:17.041 --> 00:54:18.450
<v Speaker 3>you passed here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you passed here,</v>

1294
00:54:18.451 --> 00:54:21.390
<v Speaker 3>but you did it here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For your metabolites to be this low,</v>

1295
00:54:21.391 --> 00:54:23.940
<v Speaker 3>you would have had to have taken it six</v>
<v Speaker 3>weeks before,</v>

1296
00:54:23.941 --> 00:54:25.000
<v Speaker 3>but we tested you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're there.</v>

1297
00:54:25.270 --> 00:54:27.300
<v Speaker 3>They are even confused on their science.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're,</v>

1298
00:54:27.301 --> 00:54:29.310
<v Speaker 3>they've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've admitted that they go at the</v>

1299
00:54:29.311 --> 00:54:30.780
<v Speaker 3>shows up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got to do something with it,</v>

1300
00:54:30.781 --> 00:54:33.690
<v Speaker 3>but we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't understand how you had this</v>

1301
00:54:33.691 --> 00:54:36.330
<v Speaker 3>reading and frankly I'll tell you</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything I did.</v>

1302
00:54:36.331 --> 00:54:38.040
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you everything I ate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

1303
00:54:38.041 --> 00:54:40.470
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how this works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You give me the answer and they're even</v>

1304
00:54:40.471 --> 00:54:41.850
<v Speaker 3>confused themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go ahead.</v>

1305
00:54:41.890 --> 00:54:42.990
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this shouldn't be.</v>

1306
00:54:43.170 --> 00:54:44.550
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've got to deal with it,</v>

1307
00:54:44.551 --> 00:54:46.440
<v Speaker 3>but it take the supplements,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the test,</v>

1308
00:54:46.441 --> 00:54:47.274
<v Speaker 3>the things that he's.</v>

1309
00:54:47.340 --> 00:54:49.830
<v Speaker 3>Frank hadn't taken any supplements.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the other thing he said he</v>

1310
00:54:49.831 --> 00:54:51.330
<v Speaker 3>fought in some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some different country.</v>

1311
00:54:51.331 --> 00:54:51.840
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1312
00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:54.720
<v Speaker 3>and everybody made fun of him for this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was just being honest,</v>

1313
00:54:54.980 --> 00:54:59.910
<v Speaker 3>catering and he knows how he said that</v>
<v Speaker 3>he now that the headlights made them</v>

1314
00:54:59.911 --> 00:55:01.680
<v Speaker 3>look bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but frank was just being Kennedy because</v>

1315
00:55:01.681 --> 00:55:02.760
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only thing I've done different.</v>

1316
00:55:02.761 --> 00:55:05.220
<v Speaker 3>I was in this different country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some kangaroo meat for the first time.</v>

1317
00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:08.370
<v Speaker 3>Everyone teased him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's going to ask me.</v>

1318
00:55:08.371 --> 00:55:10.330
<v Speaker 3>They asked me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have you done anything different with</v>

1319
00:55:10.331 --> 00:55:12.450
<v Speaker 3>the IOC is telling athletes we're food</v>

1320
00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:16.760
<v Speaker 1>in certain parts of the world in China</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in Russia in particular to not eat</v>

1321
00:55:16.761 --> 00:55:20.270
<v Speaker 1>the meat because if you eat the meat you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could potentially test positive.</v>

1322
00:55:20.310 --> 00:55:22.080
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Depending on when it came it.</v>

1323
00:55:22.081 --> 00:55:25.110
<v Speaker 3>So frank offering them that was just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1324
00:55:25.111 --> 00:55:27.450
<v Speaker 3>he got teased for it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was just being candid.</v>

1325
00:55:27.451 --> 00:55:28.820
<v Speaker 3>He might be right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1326
00:55:28.850 --> 00:55:30.870
<v Speaker 3>I mean he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he might've got some unscrupulous</v>

1327
00:55:30.871 --> 00:55:31.930
<v Speaker 3>kangaroo meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1328
00:55:32.130 --> 00:55:34.710
<v Speaker 3>And Frank's always been an open guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was on testosterone.</v>

1329
00:55:34.711 --> 00:55:36.870
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't one of the guys that tried to</v>
<v Speaker 3>hide it like the other guys.</v>

1330
00:55:36.871 --> 00:55:38.210
<v Speaker 3>He went and asked for the tea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Frank.</v>

1331
00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:41.190
<v Speaker 3>So a pretty straight up guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's an open book and it's not all great</v>

1332
00:55:41.191 --> 00:55:41.821
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1333
00:55:41.821 --> 00:55:44.880
<v Speaker 3>he'll tell you this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you what frank says.</v>

1334
00:55:44.881 --> 00:55:45.570
<v Speaker 3>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tend,</v>

1335
00:55:45.570 --> 00:55:46.403
<v Speaker 3>I believe him.</v>

1336
00:55:46.430 --> 00:55:47.041
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

1337
00:55:47.041 --> 00:55:48.080
<v Speaker 1>I do as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1338
00:55:48.081 --> 00:55:51.020
<v Speaker 1>He's just an.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has also a career of being straight</v>

1339
00:55:51.021 --> 00:55:53.840
<v Speaker 1>up to start being deceptive now over</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that doesn't really</v>

1340
00:55:53.841 --> 00:55:55.710
<v Speaker 1>necessarily make sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1341
00:55:55.730 --> 00:55:58.220
<v Speaker 1>after losing the Mark Hunt like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This doesn't make sense.</v>

1342
00:55:58.240 --> 00:55:59.590
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1343
00:55:59.720 --> 00:56:03.180
<v Speaker 1>the testosterone thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is a,</v>

1344
00:56:03.230 --> 00:56:07.700
<v Speaker 1>another thing that I feel like was</v>
<v Speaker 1>medically very irresponsible the way</v>

1345
00:56:07.701 --> 00:56:12.701
<v Speaker 1>they handled it and also that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't allow guys to take something like</v>

1346
00:56:13.221 --> 00:56:18.221
<v Speaker 1>an estrogen blocker or something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hcg or something that restarts your end</v>

1347
00:56:18.561 --> 00:56:19.394
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>consist of,</v>

1348
00:56:19.550 --> 00:56:23.560
<v Speaker 1>but yet they allow these guys to fight</v>
<v Speaker 1>and scheduled flights just a couple of</v>

1349
00:56:23.561 --> 00:56:25.990
<v Speaker 1>months after getting off testosterone</v>
<v Speaker 1>therapy.</v>

1350
00:56:26.170 --> 00:56:29.170
<v Speaker 1>So you put these athletes in a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>precarious situation where you're</v>

1351
00:56:29.171 --> 00:56:31.900
<v Speaker 1>dangling this gigantic financial carrot</v>
<v Speaker 1>in front of them.</v>

1352
00:56:32.220 --> 00:56:32.981
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're saying,</v>

1353
00:56:32.981 --> 00:56:34.090
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got to fight.</v>

1354
00:56:34.330 --> 00:56:36.370
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to make x amount of dollars</v>

1355
00:56:36.371 --> 00:56:38.620
<v Speaker 1>is going to be awesome for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But here's the kicker,</v>

1356
00:56:38.770 --> 00:56:41.230
<v Speaker 1>no more testosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so all this stuff,</v>

1357
00:56:41.260 --> 00:56:45.670
<v Speaker 1>it's been making you feel good and</v>
<v Speaker 1>making your camps go better and allowing</v>

1358
00:56:45.671 --> 00:56:47.920
<v Speaker 1>you to recover faster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That shit's out the door.</v>

1359
00:56:48.340 --> 00:56:52.390
<v Speaker 1>So now you have to deal with not just</v>
<v Speaker 1>your 37 year old endocrine system,</v>

1360
00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:56.870
<v Speaker 1>which is fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a 37 year old and inconsistent and</v>

1361
00:56:56.890 --> 00:56:59.020
<v Speaker 1>that needs to be restarted and you can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>restart it.</v>

1362
00:56:59.290 --> 00:56:59.921
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

1363
00:56:59.921 --> 00:57:00.381
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1364
00:57:00.381 --> 00:57:02.110
<v Speaker 2>and they do put them in a tough spot</v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

1365
00:57:02.250 --> 00:57:05.050
<v Speaker 2>And I would be curious if this was ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>tested in a court because they put them</v>

1366
00:57:05.051 --> 00:57:08.020
<v Speaker 2>in an interesting spot where a guy gets</v>
<v Speaker 2>advice from his doctor,</v>

1367
00:57:08.050 --> 00:57:12.100
<v Speaker 2>which you're supposed to listen to and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has to cross reference that advice</v>

1368
00:57:12.850 --> 00:57:15.550
<v Speaker 2>with an athletic commission will time</v>
<v Speaker 2>out a second.</v>

1369
00:57:15.551 --> 00:57:16.940
<v Speaker 2>We're not talking about illegal drugs</v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

1370
00:57:16.950 --> 00:57:21.950
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about legal medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>FDA approved medicine that I'm taking</v>

1371
00:57:22.210 --> 00:57:25.810
<v Speaker 2>appropriately and in conjunction with my</v>
<v Speaker 2>physician and you're telling me I can't</v>

1372
00:57:25.811 --> 00:57:27.970
<v Speaker 2>take it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that even happens with the common</v>

1373
00:57:27.971 --> 00:57:30.700
<v Speaker 2>cold flu and that they'll be in some of</v>
<v Speaker 2>these silly things.</v>

1374
00:57:30.701 --> 00:57:33.310
<v Speaker 2>And Anderson Silva,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he popped for that steroid,</v>

1375
00:57:33.610 --> 00:57:36.220
<v Speaker 2>but two of the things he popped for were</v>
<v Speaker 2>over the counter.</v>

1376
00:57:36.221 --> 00:57:39.970
<v Speaker 2>One of them is a sleep aid that sits on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the shelf next to Nyquil.</v>

1377
00:57:39.970 --> 00:57:42.990
<v Speaker 2>None of us knew was band until he got</v>
<v Speaker 2>flagged for.</v>

1378
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:43.990
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scratch our head guy.</v>

1379
00:57:44.230 --> 00:57:47.350
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's on the banned list.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is a sleep aid provide like as far</v>

1380
00:57:47.351 --> 00:57:48.710
<v Speaker 2>as performance benefit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>

1381
00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:50.680
<v Speaker 2>So everybody likes to go back to that</v>
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>

1382
00:57:50.681 --> 00:57:52.590
<v Speaker 2>This doesn't help my performance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1383
00:57:52.591 --> 00:57:54.730
<v Speaker 2>it's not a performance test.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a steroids test.</v>

1384
00:57:54.731 --> 00:57:58.330
<v Speaker 2>It's not a drugs test.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a banned substance test.</v>

1385
00:57:58.331 --> 00:58:00.640
<v Speaker 2>And that's where they go way out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>bounds.</v>

1386
00:58:00.641 --> 00:58:02.650
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I think back to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1387
00:58:02.700 --> 00:58:05.040
<v Speaker 2>the Chinese gymnast where they stripped</v>
<v Speaker 2>her metal,</v>

1388
00:58:05.250 --> 00:58:07.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in 2004 and kicked her out of the</v>

1389
00:58:07.121 --> 00:58:10.210
<v Speaker 2>Olympics forever because she had a</v>
<v Speaker 2>billionth of a trace of Ibuprofen which</v>

1390
00:58:10.211 --> 00:58:12.120
<v Speaker 2>has a street name of advil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going,</v>

1391
00:58:12.250 --> 00:58:13.550
<v Speaker 2>this is silly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1392
00:58:13.580 --> 00:58:14.240
<v Speaker 2>this is silly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

1393
00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:15.610
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an antiinflammatory in that would</v>

1394
00:58:15.611 --> 00:58:19.330
<v Speaker 2>help performance you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good thing to take some legal</v>

1395
00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:21.830
<v Speaker 2>to take a legal thing that you've found</v>
<v Speaker 2>that can help you.</v>

1396
00:58:22.010 --> 00:58:23.830
<v Speaker 2>Why would you take anything that could</v>
<v Speaker 2>hurt you?</v>

1397
00:58:24.040 --> 00:58:25.450
<v Speaker 2>That was another thing that John came</v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

1398
00:58:25.451 --> 00:58:28.600
<v Speaker 2>He was so adamant that I took nothing to</v>
<v Speaker 2>help my performance.</v>

1399
00:58:29.020 --> 00:58:29.711
<v Speaker 2>I'm going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>John,</v>

1400
00:58:29.711 --> 00:58:33.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why that's the high canon</v>
<v Speaker 2>of bad things you don't want to be</v>

1401
00:58:33.011 --> 00:58:34.690
<v Speaker 2>associated with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You took coke,</v>

1402
00:58:34.750 --> 00:58:38.980
<v Speaker 2>which is a felony and can kill you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now you're standing on the moral</v>

1403
00:58:38.981 --> 00:58:41.290
<v Speaker 2>high ground that you didn't take</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything that could help you.</v>

1404
00:58:41.291 --> 00:58:43.300
<v Speaker 2>That's just weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's weird.</v>

1405
00:58:43.301 --> 00:58:45.940
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird way to phrase it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you say,</v>

1406
00:58:45.941 --> 00:58:50.941
<v Speaker 2>I didn't take anything that would help</v>
<v Speaker 2>my performance than yc saying no.</v>

1407
00:58:51.610 --> 00:58:54.270
<v Speaker 2>Say what the fuck you took and why you</v>
<v Speaker 2>took it.</v>

1408
00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:55.840
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say what it is,</v>

1409
00:58:56.050 --> 00:58:58.540
<v Speaker 2>but we only white Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would you take any of it's a</v>

1410
00:58:58.541 --> 00:59:01.450
<v Speaker 2>supplement or anything else?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would you take it if you didn't have</v>

1411
00:59:01.451 --> 00:59:03.850
<v Speaker 2>a reasonable expectation that it helped</v>
<v Speaker 2>your performance because you're not</v>

1412
00:59:03.851 --> 00:59:05.440
<v Speaker 2>taking it for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you're taking for the opposite.</v>

1413
00:59:05.441 --> 00:59:06.274
<v Speaker 2>It has to be one of them.</v>

1414
00:59:06.280 --> 00:59:07.930
<v Speaker 1>What are you taking it for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something else in life.</v>

1415
00:59:07.990 --> 00:59:11.560
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you've taken it for anxiety maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't make any sense with</v>

1416
00:59:11.561 --> 00:59:13.450
<v Speaker 1>what he was taking it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1417
00:59:13.451 --> 00:59:13.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1418
00:59:13.930 --> 00:59:17.530
<v Speaker 1>Anderson was taking a liquid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seattle's because he likes to party.</v>

1419
00:59:18.670 --> 00:59:19.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

1420
00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:22.040
<v Speaker 1>Why do people take different</v>

1421
00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:24.290
<v Speaker 4>things that are not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that have nothing to do with athletic</v>

1422
00:59:24.291 --> 00:59:26.330
<v Speaker 4>performance?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They take it because there's a desired</v>

1423
00:59:26.331 --> 00:59:27.950
<v Speaker 4>result.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1424
00:59:28.310 --> 00:59:30.200
<v Speaker 4>but what I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're trying to fall into the scope</v>

1425
00:59:30.201 --> 00:59:33.080
<v Speaker 4>of a medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well I can have an estrogen blocker</v>

1426
00:59:33.081 --> 00:59:34.130
<v Speaker 4>would be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or testosterone.</v>

1427
00:59:34.131 --> 00:59:37.100
<v Speaker 4>Those are classified as medicine and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then maybe it can call it drugs all they</v>

1428
00:59:37.101 --> 00:59:38.840
<v Speaker 4>want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's medicine under the FDA.</v>

1429
00:59:38.930 --> 00:59:42.590
<v Speaker 4>You can't become a medicine unless you</v>
<v Speaker 4>can reasonably prove that it's going to</v>

1430
00:59:42.591 --> 00:59:44.840
<v Speaker 4>help a patient.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't be a doctor.</v>

1431
00:59:44.841 --> 00:59:47.930
<v Speaker 4>Give somebody something that brings them</v>
<v Speaker 4>down and makes them worse.</v>

1432
00:59:47.931 --> 00:59:49.010
<v Speaker 4>That's malpractice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1433
00:59:49.011 --> 00:59:52.580
<v Speaker 4>here's what I'm saying is I know for</v>
<v Speaker 4>while he denied that it would help his</v>

1434
00:59:52.581 --> 00:59:53.121
<v Speaker 4>performance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1435
00:59:53.121 --> 00:59:54.620
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course you took it to make you feel,</v>

1436
00:59:54.621 --> 00:59:56.360
<v Speaker 4>but whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm drinking coffee right now for the</v>

1437
00:59:56.361 --> 00:59:58.430
<v Speaker 4>caffeine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's just what it is.</v>

1438
00:59:58.670 --> 01:00:01.640
<v Speaker 4>That that helps your performance and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>were one of the first people to tell me</v>

1439
01:00:01.641 --> 01:00:05.450
<v Speaker 4>that there's a very specific amount of</v>
<v Speaker 4>caffeine that you're allowed to have,</v>

1440
01:00:05.451 --> 01:00:07.160
<v Speaker 4>so you would take an for them.</v>

1441
01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:08.810
<v Speaker 4>You wouldn't trust a cup of coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1442
01:00:08.811 --> 01:00:10.370
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

1443
01:00:10.371 --> 01:00:11.930
<v Speaker 4>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is true,</v>

1444
01:00:11.931 --> 01:00:14.920
<v Speaker 4>but I just think that's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One to.</v>

1445
01:00:15.090 --> 01:00:17.960
<v Speaker 4>They say that to now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'd have to be tested your bodies to</v>

1446
01:00:17.961 --> 01:00:20.900
<v Speaker 4>all these different things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they say that two cups of coffee in</v>

1447
01:00:20.901 --> 01:00:23.870
<v Speaker 4>a 15 minute period will make you test</v>
<v Speaker 4>hot.</v>

1448
01:00:24.140 --> 01:00:27.950
<v Speaker 4>Now you'll only test taught for about 15</v>
<v Speaker 4>minutes because caffeine wears off so</v>

1449
01:00:27.951 --> 01:00:29.120
<v Speaker 4>fast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yes,</v>

1450
01:00:29.121 --> 01:00:31.820
<v Speaker 4>if somebody was to come in right now</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've got three different coffees in</v>

1451
01:00:31.821 --> 01:00:34.220
<v Speaker 4>front of me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could be above the limit on that.</v>

1452
01:00:34.260 --> 01:00:35.340
<v Speaker 4>I'm sitting here going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1453
01:00:35.470 --> 01:00:38.340
<v Speaker 4>I'm getting jazzed up to do a podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure that that.</v>

1454
01:00:38.570 --> 01:00:40.940
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure that that relates,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the rules are the rules.</v>

1455
01:00:40.941 --> 01:00:43.250
<v Speaker 4>I'd be cheating,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but is that out of competition since it</v>

1456
01:00:43.251 --> 01:00:46.220
<v Speaker 4>has such a short life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if you came in here is because when</v>

1457
01:00:46.221 --> 01:00:49.280
<v Speaker 4>John tested positive for cocaine against</v>
<v Speaker 4>Daniel,</v>

1458
01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:51.740
<v Speaker 4>it was three weeks out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it was out of competition.</v>

1459
01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:53.480
<v Speaker 4>So it wasn't like he was fighting coked</v>
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>

1460
01:00:53.980 --> 01:00:54.711
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

1461
01:00:54.711 --> 01:00:57.160
<v Speaker 4>And there is two different sets of</v>
<v Speaker 4>standards there.</v>

1462
01:00:57.450 --> 01:00:59.680
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and caffeine gotTa,</v>

1463
01:00:59.830 --> 01:01:01.910
<v Speaker 4>if you're out of competition,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you must be fine.</v>

1464
01:01:02.090 --> 01:01:04.760
<v Speaker 4>Advils and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we talked about advil or there is some</v>

1465
01:01:04.761 --> 01:01:07.370
<v Speaker 4>that are only band in competition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are a lot out of competition and</v>

1466
01:01:07.371 --> 01:01:09.860
<v Speaker 4>then there's some no nos forever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's where it starts to get</v>

1467
01:01:09.861 --> 01:01:12.170
<v Speaker 4>confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then the way they've handled it is</v>

1468
01:01:12.171 --> 01:01:13.730
<v Speaker 4>to go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's on the athlete.</v>

1469
01:01:13.870 --> 01:01:14.421
<v Speaker 4>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1470
01:01:14.421 --> 01:01:15.350
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fair enough.</v>

1471
01:01:15.351 --> 01:01:17.030
<v Speaker 4>But athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>particularly,</v>

1472
01:01:17.031 --> 01:01:20.330
<v Speaker 4>fighters are the lowest form of society.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're the government.</v>

1473
01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:23.720
<v Speaker 4>You can't just put it on the athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's got to be your,</v>

1474
01:01:23.721 --> 01:01:25.850
<v Speaker 4>the government.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're operating on the taxpayer's</v>

1475
01:01:25.851 --> 01:01:27.110
<v Speaker 4>dollar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got offices,</v>

1476
01:01:27.111 --> 01:01:29.780
<v Speaker 4>you're making the rule.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You take some responsibility to.</v>

1477
01:01:30.110 --> 01:01:30.801
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1478
01:01:30.801 --> 01:01:31.850
<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>

1479
01:01:31.970 --> 01:01:35.420
<v Speaker 4>And I think especially when you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about a medical issue like this</v>

1480
01:01:35.421 --> 01:01:38.390
<v Speaker 4>testosterone therapy issue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's worked itself out.</v>

1481
01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:40.040
<v Speaker 4>That does,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did settle in time.</v>

1482
01:01:40.041 --> 01:01:43.430
<v Speaker 4>They allowed it to just play itself out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think a lot of guys got fucked</v>

1483
01:01:43.431 --> 01:01:45.320
<v Speaker 4>over and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hate to,</v>

1484
01:01:45.321 --> 01:01:47.390
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>be a Vituro apologist.</v>

1485
01:01:47.950 --> 01:01:50.300
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but because I've been such a,</v>

1486
01:01:50.340 --> 01:01:52.460
<v Speaker 4>I was such a fan of trt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Veto loved him.</v>

1487
01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:53.910
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we all did.</v>

1488
01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:55.670
<v Speaker 4>It was such a free is great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When he,</v>

1489
01:01:55.700 --> 01:01:57.620
<v Speaker 4>when he fought bisping and rockhold</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

1490
01:01:57.621 --> 01:02:01.460
<v Speaker 4>we'll kick in people and don't be t RTV</v>
<v Speaker 4>tour was fucking terrifying.</v>

1491
01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:06.760
<v Speaker 4>But vituro when he fought Weidman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember feeling when he went into the</v>

1492
01:02:07.011 --> 01:02:10.010
<v Speaker 4>octagon and I saw him bouncing around</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's loose,</v>

1493
01:02:10.011 --> 01:02:11.990
<v Speaker 4>skin was moving all over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His body is like,</v>

1494
01:02:11.991 --> 01:02:13.280
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy's fucked.</v>

1495
01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:14.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like his body is fucked.</v>

1496
01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:18.950
<v Speaker 4>This is not a regular 37 year old guy</v>
<v Speaker 4>who was in shape who hasn't taken</v>

1497
01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:20.180
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1498
01:02:20.250 --> 01:02:25.250
<v Speaker 1>this is a fucking world championship</v>
<v Speaker 1>caliber pro athlete whose bodies been</v>

1499
01:02:25.590 --> 01:02:28.110
<v Speaker 1>just compromised,</v>
<v Speaker 1>massively compromised.</v>

1500
01:02:28.111 --> 01:02:28.291
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1501
01:02:28.291 --> 01:02:30.540
<v Speaker 1>he's rebounded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looked much better now,</v>

1502
01:02:30.810 --> 01:02:32.010
<v Speaker 1>but God damn you look terrible</v>

1503
01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:35.080
<v Speaker 2>and acg is so important for any doctor</v>
<v Speaker 2>will tell you.</v>

1504
01:02:35.081 --> 01:02:36.530
<v Speaker 2>If you go on testosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got it.</v>

1505
01:02:36.531 --> 01:02:38.420
<v Speaker 2>Then go on Hcg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to turn that,</v>

1506
01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:41.060
<v Speaker 2>turn that back on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't have that benefit.</v>

1507
01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:44.150
<v Speaker 2>The rules came in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had two different flags and he just</v>

1508
01:02:44.151 --> 01:02:47.300
<v Speaker 2>wasn't ready to go down that path,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he literally stopped everything cold</v>

1509
01:02:47.301 --> 01:02:49.510
<v Speaker 2>Turkey opposite of the advice of his</v>
<v Speaker 2>doctrine.</v>

1510
01:02:49.550 --> 01:02:51.950
<v Speaker 2>I've never asked him about the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just know his doctor would have said,</v>

1511
01:02:51.951 --> 01:02:52.820
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what you need,</v>

1512
01:02:52.821 --> 01:02:53.840
<v Speaker 2>and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm out.</v>

1513
01:02:54.100 --> 01:02:56.420
<v Speaker 2>There's no room for error here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've changed the rules.</v>

1514
01:02:56.421 --> 01:02:57.254
<v Speaker 2>I'm out</v>

1515
01:02:57.580 --> 01:02:59.410
<v Speaker 1>as crazy as they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That could affect them longterm,</v>

1516
01:02:59.411 --> 01:02:59.790
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

1517
01:02:59.790 --> 01:03:02.480
<v Speaker 1>it certainly can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and certainly the beating that he took</v>

1518
01:03:02.481 --> 01:03:04.300
<v Speaker 1>could affect them longterm and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>beating.</v>

1519
01:03:04.330 --> 01:03:08.650
<v Speaker 1>There's a big factor of having</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly low testosterone and we have</v>

1520
01:03:08.651 --> 01:03:11.370
<v Speaker 1>very low testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he went into that fight there,</v>

1521
01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:14.500
<v Speaker 1>there would be a possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually see that's not true.</v>

1522
01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:19.000
<v Speaker 1>I should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should recant that because Weidman got</v>

1523
01:03:19.001 --> 01:03:24.001
<v Speaker 1>in his face at the way in and was saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>you took because he tested at 1200 and</v>

1524
01:03:24.221 --> 01:03:27.790
<v Speaker 1>Weidman tested it three and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is going on?</v>

1525
01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:32.050
<v Speaker 1>How do you have four times as much</v>
<v Speaker 1>testosterone is me and I talked to</v>

1526
01:03:32.051 --> 01:03:33.100
<v Speaker 1>Novitsky about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was trying.</v>

1527
01:03:33.130 --> 01:03:35.740
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please explain to a moron like me,</v>

1528
01:03:35.860 --> 01:03:37.930
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were saying,</v>

1529
01:03:37.931 --> 01:03:38.480
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1530
01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:40.900
<v Speaker 1>it's dependent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's time dependent.</v>

1531
01:03:41.110 --> 01:03:43.290
<v Speaker 1>It's how much available testosterone to</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1532
01:03:43.300 --> 01:03:46.750
<v Speaker 1>Like when did they test him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was He recovering from sleep?</v>

1533
01:03:46.751 --> 01:03:48.300
<v Speaker 1>Was he at its peak?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was.</v>

1534
01:03:48.510 --> 01:03:53.510
<v Speaker 1>Did he had he done explosive athletics</v>
<v Speaker 1>like squats or deadlifts very recently,</v>

1535
01:03:54.281 --> 01:03:56.740
<v Speaker 1>and then recovered his testosterone ramp</v>
<v Speaker 1>back up.</v>

1536
01:03:56.890 --> 01:04:01.300
<v Speaker 1>Did they catch Weidman after Weidman had</v>
<v Speaker 1>a grueling workout and his testosterone</v>

1537
01:04:01.301 --> 01:04:02.410
<v Speaker 1>was down?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1538
01:04:02.470 --> 01:04:04.240
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of factors apparently</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1539
01:04:04.241 --> 01:04:07.150
<v Speaker 1>that play into that and Weidman and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>even said himself,</v>

1540
01:04:07.151 --> 01:04:07.631
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1541
01:04:07.631 --> 01:04:09.850
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of have low testosterone while</v>

1542
01:04:09.851 --> 01:04:11.380
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While TRT was illegal.</v>

1543
01:04:11.590 --> 01:04:13.000
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could qualify for it.</v>

1544
01:04:13.001 --> 01:04:14.260
<v Speaker 1>I can go in and qualify for it.</v>

1545
01:04:14.650 --> 01:04:16.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember that very well,</v>

1546
01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:19.690
<v Speaker 2>but dev toward did not have any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1547
01:04:19.990 --> 01:04:23.200
<v Speaker 2>he did not have testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did his level was high and all of</v>

1548
01:04:23.201 --> 01:04:25.240
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he didn't have any endogenous</v>

1549
01:04:25.241 --> 01:04:27.700
<v Speaker 2>testosterone in him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had no supplement whatsoever,</v>

1550
01:04:27.701 --> 01:04:32.050
<v Speaker 2>so that was a little bit misunderstood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then also thank you very much.</v>

1551
01:04:32.051 --> 01:04:34.790
<v Speaker 2>And then also to his po or to your point</v>
<v Speaker 2>Weidman,</v>

1552
01:04:34.860 --> 01:04:36.940
<v Speaker 2>when he was tested,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he would have been tested in the</v>

1553
01:04:36.941 --> 01:04:39.360
<v Speaker 2>morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would have been down a if he would've</v>

1554
01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:41.920
<v Speaker 2>just had a hard workout and chewed up a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of the test,</v>

1555
01:04:42.030 --> 01:04:43.980
<v Speaker 2>it would have been done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was a little confusing.</v>

1556
01:04:43.990 --> 01:04:48.220
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] hands were clean there and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chris was misunderstanding what he was</v>

1557
01:04:48.221 --> 01:04:52.480
<v Speaker 2>reading and let loose on him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Chris had every right to assume that</v>

1558
01:04:52.481 --> 01:04:54.370
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] was still trying to slip</v>
<v Speaker 2>that through.</v>

1559
01:04:54.371 --> 01:04:57.130
<v Speaker 2>That was the better part of his career.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in fairness,</v>

1560
01:04:57.131 --> 01:04:58.480
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When Vitorin goes,</v>

1561
01:04:58.481 --> 01:04:59.231
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm out.</v>

1562
01:04:59.231 --> 01:05:00.064
<v Speaker 2>He really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1563
01:05:00.070 --> 01:05:02.410
<v Speaker 2>he was out and they tested the hell out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Itar.</v>

1564
01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:04.510
<v Speaker 2>He's passed them off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Victoria went straight.</v>

1565
01:05:04.570 --> 01:05:05.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had to.</v>

1566
01:05:05.620 --> 01:05:07.870
<v Speaker 1>And his body really showed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1567
01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:10.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when did he fought Henderson,</v>

1568
01:05:10.390 --> 01:05:11.021
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1569
01:05:11.021 --> 01:05:14.110
<v Speaker 1>the third Henderson fight in Brazil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1570
01:05:14.111 --> 01:05:16.240
<v Speaker 1>he looked like he was gaining is muscle</v>
<v Speaker 1>mass back.</v>

1571
01:05:16.241 --> 01:05:17.620
<v Speaker 1>You looked it looked a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>

1572
01:05:17.621 --> 01:05:20.650
<v Speaker 1>but he's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just does not look like trt Vittorio.</v>

1573
01:05:21.190 --> 01:05:23.780
<v Speaker 1>Physically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the guy that's had the,</v>

1574
01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:25.510
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the biggest difference.</v>

1575
01:05:26.050 --> 01:05:29.740
<v Speaker 1>And I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like if you're going to just say</v>

1576
01:05:29.890 --> 01:05:32.110
<v Speaker 1>you have to be off of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think is ridiculous.</v>

1577
01:05:32.111 --> 01:05:34.330
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he wanted that title shot and is</v>

1578
01:05:34.331 --> 01:05:38.140
<v Speaker 1>really important to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I feel like that medically they had</v>

1579
01:05:38.141 --> 01:05:40.900
<v Speaker 1>a responsibility to give the guy a</v>
<v Speaker 1>break,</v>

1580
01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:44.830
<v Speaker 1>like to say we're going to give you six</v>
<v Speaker 1>months of,</v>

1581
01:05:44.890 --> 01:05:49.890
<v Speaker 1>of restorative therapy and they'll allow</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body to come back into a normal</v>

1582
01:05:50.261 --> 01:05:54.130
<v Speaker 1>testosterone range and then reenter into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the drug testing,</v>

1583
01:05:54.490 --> 01:05:57.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we'll test you during that time to</v>

1584
01:05:57.371 --> 01:06:00.670
<v Speaker 1>make sure that you're not taking</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything else on top of that.</v>

1585
01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:06.300
<v Speaker 1>But to not allow the guy any sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>medicine that can restart his endocrine</v>

1586
01:06:06.401 --> 01:06:11.401
<v Speaker 1>system seems very irresponsible when</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's such a primary factor in</v>

1587
01:06:11.620 --> 01:06:15.010
<v Speaker 1>performance in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not talking about like fucking</v>

1588
01:06:15.011 --> 01:06:17.260
<v Speaker 1>volleyball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about head kicks,</v>

1589
01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:19.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the difference between getting beat</v>

1590
01:06:19.721 --> 01:06:22.450
<v Speaker 1>up and not getting beat up there between</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting brain damage and not getting</v>

1591
01:06:22.451 --> 01:06:25.240
<v Speaker 1>brain damage could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That could play a huge factor in there.</v>

1592
01:06:25.270 --> 01:06:25.770
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1593
01:06:25.770 --> 01:06:27.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think in hindsight,</v>

1594
01:06:27.420 --> 01:06:29.130
<v Speaker 2>I think the commission would have</v>
<v Speaker 2>handled it different.</v>

1595
01:06:29.131 --> 01:06:30.330
<v Speaker 2>They've kind of even said that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1596
01:06:30.331 --> 01:06:34.200
<v Speaker 2>we pulled the rug out here and they went</v>
<v Speaker 2>as close to taking some,</v>

1597
01:06:34.230 --> 01:06:36.360
<v Speaker 2>some of the responsibilities you could</v>
<v Speaker 2>without taking it.</v>

1598
01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:39.440
<v Speaker 2>And the other side was fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should've been able to myself,</v>

1599
01:06:39.510 --> 01:06:41.010
<v Speaker 2>we should have been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was just go time,</v>

1600
01:06:41.100 --> 01:06:43.500
<v Speaker 2>time out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't comply,</v>

1601
01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:45.660
<v Speaker 2>but I want to be in compliance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can't right now.</v>

1602
01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:48.240
<v Speaker 2>I've taken my oars out of the water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go do my.</v>

1603
01:06:48.270 --> 01:06:49.710
<v Speaker 2>Leave me out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't test me.</v>

1604
01:06:49.711 --> 01:06:50.800
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>

1605
01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:52.860
<v Speaker 2>Give me six months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To your point,</v>

1606
01:06:52.890 --> 01:06:55.530
<v Speaker 2>you'd almost have to retire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but none of us knew.</v>

1607
01:06:55.740 --> 01:06:57.510
<v Speaker 2>None of us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of us knew what we didn't know.</v>

1608
01:06:57.511 --> 01:06:58.860
<v Speaker 2>Like with Vandelay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the guy showed up,</v>

1609
01:06:58.861 --> 01:07:01.440
<v Speaker 2>when the guy came to me and I'm in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>closet with none of us knew what was</v>

1610
01:07:01.441 --> 01:07:01.920
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>

1611
01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:05.280
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of a different world now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to have that education process.</v>

1612
01:07:05.281 --> 01:07:06.720
<v Speaker 2>Whatever John's going through with Tim</v>
<v Speaker 2>means,</v>

1613
01:07:06.730 --> 01:07:08.880
<v Speaker 2>what frame this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how we learn,</v>

1614
01:07:08.881 --> 01:07:10.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we learned from guys stumbling and</v>

1615
01:07:10.651 --> 01:07:13.710
<v Speaker 2>stubbing their toe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just don't give a big allowance for</v>

1616
01:07:13.711 --> 01:07:15.210
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty black and white on these</v>

1617
01:07:15.211 --> 01:07:16.800
<v Speaker 2>rules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>John's going to be out for two years.</v>

1618
01:07:16.801 --> 01:07:20.370
<v Speaker 2>I keep hearing things speculative on how</v>
<v Speaker 2>long it's going to be real clear as it's</v>

1619
01:07:20.371 --> 01:07:22.350
<v Speaker 2>going to be off for two years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the minimum.</v>

1620
01:07:22.470 --> 01:07:25.590
<v Speaker 2>If he testified he's out for two years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just what it is.</v>

1621
01:07:25.620 --> 01:07:27.120
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anderson wasn't now for two years.</v>

1622
01:07:27.180 --> 01:07:29.140
<v Speaker 2>What was the person?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1623
01:07:29.250 --> 01:07:34.250
<v Speaker 2>Anderson beat the clock on the mandatory</v>
<v Speaker 2>how long you're out.</v>

1624
01:07:34.351 --> 01:07:37.590
<v Speaker 2>He came in just before that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hector lumbar came in just before that.</v>

1625
01:07:37.591 --> 01:07:40.890
<v Speaker 2>So those guys weren't subject to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anderson got,</v>

1626
01:07:41.130 --> 01:07:42.510
<v Speaker 2>they could have done whatever they want</v>
<v Speaker 2>for it.</v>

1627
01:07:42.540 --> 01:07:45.120
<v Speaker 2>To him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the standard was nine to 12 months.</v>

1628
01:07:45.210 --> 01:07:47.610
<v Speaker 2>He probably would have got nine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he denied it to the event,</v>

1629
01:07:47.611 --> 01:07:50.280
<v Speaker 2>the hate that he shows up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of a sudden he doesn't speak</v>

1630
01:07:50.281 --> 01:07:53.010
<v Speaker 2>English.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They hate that they were still pretty</v>

1631
01:07:53.011 --> 01:07:57.930
<v Speaker 2>light on him though for three substances</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a guy that still a was resisting the</v>

1632
01:07:57.931 --> 01:08:01.950
<v Speaker 2>test and coming in with the store and</v>
<v Speaker 2>refusing to talk to him 12 months that</v>

1633
01:08:01.980 --> 01:08:04.170
<v Speaker 2>they were pretty reasonable by their</v>
<v Speaker 2>standards,</v>

1634
01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:06.960
<v Speaker 1>by their standard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think is a reasonable</v>

1635
01:08:06.961 --> 01:08:10.440
<v Speaker 1>suspension?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If a guy does get popped for estrogen</v>

1636
01:08:10.441 --> 01:08:11.550
<v Speaker 1>blockers and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1637
01:08:11.551 --> 01:08:12.930
<v Speaker 1>I fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want an edge.</v>

1638
01:08:12.931 --> 01:08:15.080
<v Speaker 1>I took it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's a reasonable amount of</v>

1639
01:08:15.081 --> 01:08:16.030
<v Speaker 1>suspension?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

1640
01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:19.280
<v Speaker 2>My answer will be different because you</v>
<v Speaker 2>said for estrogen blockers,</v>

1641
01:08:19.281 --> 01:08:21.100
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's blocking something.</v>

1642
01:08:21.101 --> 01:08:23.300
<v Speaker 2>He's not adding something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's blocking something.</v>

1643
01:08:23.301 --> 01:08:26.450
<v Speaker 2>Now they come back in with their</v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectual approach to go where you're</v>

1644
01:08:26.451 --> 01:08:27.920
<v Speaker 2>only blocking it because you did</v>
<v Speaker 2>something before.</v>

1645
01:08:27.921 --> 01:08:29.570
<v Speaker 2>We didn't catch it before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we're going to get you now.</v>

1646
01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:33.050
<v Speaker 2>Not a terrible argument,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you just look at what he did,</v>

1647
01:08:33.051 --> 01:08:34.580
<v Speaker 2>I think that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there needs to be some</v>

1648
01:08:34.581 --> 01:08:37.040
<v Speaker 2>conversation there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was there in front of the Commission</v>

1649
01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:40.550
<v Speaker 2>One day I got approved for a steroid for</v>
<v Speaker 2>testosterone.</v>

1650
01:08:41.390 --> 01:08:46.390
<v Speaker 2>That same day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nick Diaz took $100,000 fine and lost</v>

1651
01:08:46.431 --> 01:08:51.431
<v Speaker 2>his license for a year for pot of which</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had illegal medication for Blah Blah.</v>

1652
01:08:52.371 --> 01:08:55.310
<v Speaker 2>You know the story on that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you never know what's going to happen</v>

1653
01:08:55.311 --> 01:08:57.530
<v Speaker 2>when you get in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You never know what's going to happen.</v>

1654
01:08:57.531 --> 01:08:59.570
<v Speaker 2>It's not a courtroom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Media likes to say he's gonna have his</v>

1655
01:08:59.571 --> 01:09:00.500
<v Speaker 2>day in court.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the.</v>

1656
01:09:00.530 --> 01:09:04.520
<v Speaker 2>You don't have a day in court.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Court implies a judge which implies a</v>

1657
01:09:04.521 --> 01:09:06.980
<v Speaker 2>disinterested third party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going in front of the people who</v>

1658
01:09:06.981 --> 01:09:09.680
<v Speaker 2>have accused you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if they clear you there,</v>

1659
01:09:09.681 --> 01:09:11.270
<v Speaker 2>now admitting they got it wrong to start</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

1660
01:09:11.271 --> 01:09:15.410
<v Speaker 2>that's literally never happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have never been wrong where they</v>

1661
01:09:15.411 --> 01:09:15.791
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1662
01:09:15.791 --> 01:09:17.030
<v Speaker 2>we have this wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go on about your day.</v>

1663
01:09:17.031 --> 01:09:17.690
<v Speaker 2>It's never happened.</v>

1664
01:09:17.690 --> 01:09:21.200
<v Speaker 1>Is vandelay the first guy to sue the</v>
<v Speaker 1>athletic commission and when.</v>

1665
01:09:21.780 --> 01:09:22.980
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was he the for?</v>

1666
01:09:22.981 --> 01:09:24.960
<v Speaker 2>I can't think of anyone else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'd have to look.</v>

1667
01:09:24.961 --> 01:09:27.180
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nick Diaz did the same thing and they</v>

1668
01:09:27.181 --> 01:09:27.811
<v Speaker 2>finally said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1669
01:09:27.811 --> 01:09:28.540
<v Speaker 2>he'll look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's settle,</v>

1670
01:09:28.540 --> 01:09:31.070
<v Speaker 1>but I think with Nick Diaz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they made a compromise and they,</v>

1671
01:09:31.071 --> 01:09:33.360
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they abandoned for five years for pot</v>

1672
01:09:33.361 --> 01:09:36.000
<v Speaker 1>and the world went crazy and I gave out</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fucking Nevada state athletic</v>

1673
01:09:36.001 --> 01:09:37.080
<v Speaker 1>commission,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his phone number.</v>

1674
01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:38.520
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>call him up,</v>

1675
01:09:38.550 --> 01:09:39.990
<v Speaker 1>tell him it's sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1676
01:09:40.050 --> 01:09:42.360
<v Speaker 1>And the whole world went crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet was,</v>

1677
01:09:42.390 --> 01:09:46.410
<v Speaker 1>they were making petitions and everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>was emailing and writing people.</v>

1678
01:09:46.411 --> 01:09:50.000
<v Speaker 1>People were like justifiably outraged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>

1679
01:09:50.110 --> 01:09:53.220
<v Speaker 1>that was a little bit different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They reduced his sentence and the</v>

1680
01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:56.730
<v Speaker 1>vandelay thing was interesting because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seemed like a judge outside of the</v>

1681
01:09:56.731 --> 01:09:58.590
<v Speaker 1>commission made the call.</v>

1682
01:09:58.660 --> 01:10:02.020
<v Speaker 2>That is who did it and it was really</v>
<v Speaker 2>weird because they came in with two</v>

1683
01:10:02.021 --> 01:10:02.771
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First off,</v>

1684
01:10:02.771 --> 01:10:04.480
<v Speaker 2>can you banned him for life?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And second,</v>

1685
01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:07.750
<v Speaker 2>did you have jurisdiction over?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now if you read the statute,</v>

1686
01:10:08.110 --> 01:10:10.900
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to be a lawyer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The statute is very small and it's</v>

1687
01:10:10.901 --> 01:10:14.740
<v Speaker 2>extremely clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did not have jurisdiction over him.</v>

1688
01:10:14.770 --> 01:10:17.990
<v Speaker 2>At the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can do anything they want so they</v>

1689
01:10:17.991 --> 01:10:20.470
<v Speaker 2>could banned him for life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get in front of the judge,</v>

1690
01:10:20.471 --> 01:10:21.910
<v Speaker 2>the judge rule,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the opposite.</v>

1691
01:10:21.911 --> 01:10:23.890
<v Speaker 2>You can't ban him for life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's too extreme,</v>

1692
01:10:23.891 --> 01:10:28.180
<v Speaker 2>which is not true for the statute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can do that that historically they</v>

1693
01:10:28.181 --> 01:10:29.050
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they can.</v>

1694
01:10:29.770 --> 01:10:34.390
<v Speaker 2>They did not have the right to test him</v>
<v Speaker 2>though because he was not licensed yet</v>

1695
01:10:34.391 --> 01:10:38.200
<v Speaker 2>in Nevada and the statute clearly says</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the licensee of which he was not</v>

1696
01:10:38.260 --> 01:10:40.420
<v Speaker 2>kaiser who was in at the time said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

1697
01:10:41.050 --> 01:10:44.020
<v Speaker 2>the fights been announced in my state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's in my state.</v>

1698
01:10:44.021 --> 01:10:45.160
<v Speaker 2>That gives me the right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1699
01:10:45.161 --> 01:10:49.000
<v Speaker 2>the judge agreed with him that judge got</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just backwards,</v>

1700
01:10:49.001 --> 01:10:51.220
<v Speaker 2>but when they did it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they didn't realize,</v>

1701
01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:55.300
<v Speaker 2>when the judge did not rule on how long</v>
<v Speaker 2>the suspension would be,</v>

1702
01:10:55.301 --> 01:10:58.420
<v Speaker 2>he sent him back to Nevada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He still hasn't got that result.</v>

1703
01:10:58.510 --> 01:11:00.580
<v Speaker 2>So for everyday they kicked the can down</v>
<v Speaker 2>the road.</v>

1704
01:11:00.581 --> 01:11:03.730
<v Speaker 2>They when he's still suspended,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he got his release from the UFC.</v>

1705
01:11:03.820 --> 01:11:05.740
<v Speaker 2>He can go fight in another state he</v>
<v Speaker 2>wants right now.</v>

1706
01:11:05.810 --> 01:11:07.310
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's preparing to fight fader,</v>

1707
01:11:07.311 --> 01:11:08.900
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that a fight that they were trying</v>

1708
01:11:08.901 --> 01:11:09.960
<v Speaker 1>to make for reason?</v>

1709
01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:11.870
<v Speaker 2>Not that I know of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard,</v>

1710
01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:14.130
<v Speaker 2>I heard a rumor that he would get to</v>
<v Speaker 2>that eventually,</v>

1711
01:11:14.130 --> 01:11:17.460
<v Speaker 4>but vandelays got some kind of wrestling</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing lined up for like a tag team.</v>

1712
01:11:17.461 --> 01:11:20.280
<v Speaker 4>Wrestling matches how it's going to ease</v>
<v Speaker 4>his way back in the pool.</v>

1713
01:11:20.390 --> 01:11:21.720
<v Speaker 4>He just killed it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Got Hit by a car.</v>

1714
01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:22.970
<v Speaker 4>I read this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These.</v>

1715
01:11:22.980 --> 01:11:23.940
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fortunately,</v>

1716
01:11:23.941 --> 01:11:25.290
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well I thought I thought he had shoulder</v>

1717
01:11:25.291 --> 01:11:26.700
<v Speaker 4>surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He could have.</v>

1718
01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:28.470
<v Speaker 4>Could have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I heard it hasn't the latest</v>

1719
01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:29.820
<v Speaker 4>competition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1720
01:11:30.150 --> 01:11:32.640
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well I had heard that he was going to be</v>

1721
01:11:32.641 --> 01:11:34.020
<v Speaker 4>fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See if you can find that.</v>

1722
01:11:34.070 --> 01:11:36.920
<v Speaker 4>I heard that he was going to be fighting</v>
<v Speaker 4>fate or in,</v>

1723
01:11:37.190 --> 01:11:41.340
<v Speaker 4>in Japan and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the doorman seeing his fight with</v>

1724
01:11:41.341 --> 01:11:42.870
<v Speaker 4>Maldonado was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

1725
01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:47.340
<v Speaker 4>how far the mighty have fallen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He does not look the same at all.</v>

1726
01:11:47.370 --> 01:11:49.200
<v Speaker 4>Fatigue's a son of a gun too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1727
01:11:49.201 --> 01:11:51.690
<v Speaker 4>When you get tired it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't matter how good you are.</v>

1728
01:11:51.691 --> 01:11:53.160
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't matter what you did before.</v>

1729
01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:54.690
<v Speaker 4>If you get tired,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got problems.</v>

1730
01:11:54.691 --> 01:11:57.060
<v Speaker 4>Now the good news for him is Maldonado</v>
<v Speaker 4>got tired too.</v>

1731
01:11:57.210 --> 01:12:00.690
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Momo has never been a guy that's been</v>

1732
01:12:00.691 --> 01:12:04.380
<v Speaker 4>the most conditioned guy in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he is a guy with fantastic boxing,</v>

1733
01:12:04.650 --> 01:12:06.930
<v Speaker 4>very good boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he caught fade or with a couple of</v>

1734
01:12:06.931 --> 01:12:08.610
<v Speaker 4>good shots and had them really badly</v>
<v Speaker 4>hurt.</v>

1735
01:12:08.630 --> 01:12:09.930
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people think that fight could</v>

1736
01:12:09.931 --> 01:12:12.390
<v Speaker 4>have been stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean under a bad judge.</v>

1737
01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:13.650
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it should have been</v>
<v Speaker 4>stopped,</v>

1738
01:12:13.651 --> 01:12:15.990
<v Speaker 4>but under a bad referee it could have</v>
<v Speaker 4>been or referee.</v>

1739
01:12:15.991 --> 01:12:18.850
<v Speaker 4>That was a little too quick to pull the</v>
<v Speaker 4>trigger or if it wasn't in Russia for</v>

1740
01:12:18.860 --> 01:12:19.151
<v Speaker 4>one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1741
01:12:19.151 --> 01:12:21.270
<v Speaker 4>there were.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was definitely some politics there</v>

1742
01:12:21.330 --> 01:12:25.350
<v Speaker 4>and I felt bad for Maldonado Maldonado</v>
<v Speaker 4>thought he was going to get a fair shake</v>

1743
01:12:25.351 --> 01:12:26.161
<v Speaker 4>and I'm looking at it going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1744
01:12:26.161 --> 01:12:26.390
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm.</v>

1745
01:12:26.390 --> 01:12:28.830
<v Speaker 4>Although it makes sure you get a good</v>
<v Speaker 4>paycheck because you're not getting a</v>

1746
01:12:28.831 --> 01:12:32.100
<v Speaker 4>fair shake in Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then he even filed a complaint after</v>

1747
01:12:32.101 --> 01:12:34.860
<v Speaker 4>the fact that petition and he felt too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like Malden,</v>

1748
01:12:35.170 --> 01:12:37.080
<v Speaker 4>well maybe you don't know how this works</v>
<v Speaker 4>over there,</v>

1749
01:12:37.081 --> 01:12:39.060
<v Speaker 4>but that it's over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's over.</v>

1750
01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:41.550
<v Speaker 4>I mean unless he flat lined them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he wasn't winning.</v>

1751
01:12:42.090 --> 01:12:46.920
<v Speaker 4>Who would've had to have knocked him out</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm sure whatever referee at the</v>

1752
01:12:46.921 --> 01:12:50.010
<v Speaker 4>time would be very hesitant to stop that</v>
<v Speaker 4>fight with.</v>

1753
01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:51.750
<v Speaker 4>Even with theater,</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting his brains beat.</v>

1754
01:12:51.751 --> 01:12:52.980
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If he thought he could make it to the</v>

1755
01:12:52.981 --> 01:12:55.860
<v Speaker 4>bell and the real controversy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was that first round that you're</v>

1756
01:12:55.861 --> 01:12:57.150
<v Speaker 4>talking about with the ref could have</v>
<v Speaker 4>stopped.</v>

1757
01:12:57.151 --> 01:12:59.220
<v Speaker 4>It probably should have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't a 10,</v>

1758
01:12:59.221 --> 01:13:00.300
<v Speaker 4>eight round and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1759
01:13:00.301 --> 01:13:03.540
<v Speaker 4>if that's not a 10,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eight round that what is in that fight?</v>

1760
01:13:03.750 --> 01:13:04.980
<v Speaker 4>Should have been a dry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was.</v>

1761
01:13:05.070 --> 01:13:06.210
<v Speaker 4>It was one round,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was 10,</v>

1762
01:13:06.211 --> 01:13:06.511
<v Speaker 4>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>two,</v>

1763
01:13:06.511 --> 01:13:09.030
<v Speaker 4>two rounds for fader.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people argue rounds two and</v>

1764
01:13:09.031 --> 01:13:09.540
<v Speaker 4>three,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're.</v>

1765
01:13:09.540 --> 01:13:10.950
<v Speaker 4>They're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fader one those rounds.</v>

1766
01:13:10.951 --> 01:13:12.150
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he want them.</v>

1767
01:13:12.450 --> 01:13:13.850
<v Speaker 4>They should have been a drop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1768
01:13:13.860 --> 01:13:16.590
<v Speaker 4>he.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Him Not being in the UFC during his</v>

1769
01:13:16.591 --> 01:13:19.170
<v Speaker 4>prime is one of the great tragedies of</v>
<v Speaker 4>MMA.</v>

1770
01:13:19.290 --> 01:13:21.660
<v Speaker 4>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really feel that I would have loved to</v>

1771
01:13:21.661 --> 01:13:25.560
<v Speaker 4>seen the fate or that fought cro,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cop fight in the UFC and I think he</v>

1772
01:13:25.561 --> 01:13:27.150
<v Speaker 4>would have been heavyweight champion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really do.</v>

1773
01:13:27.151 --> 01:13:30.150
<v Speaker 4>I think he.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only argument against him being the</v>

1774
01:13:30.151 --> 01:13:31.680
<v Speaker 4>greatest of all time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in my opinion,</v>

1775
01:13:31.710 --> 01:13:35.550
<v Speaker 4>is Cain Velasquez and I guess you could</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of make it for overdue,</v>

1776
01:13:36.090 --> 01:13:40.020
<v Speaker 4>but I think for doing that got knocked</v>
<v Speaker 4>out by Steve Bay was a healthy Verdugo.</v>

1777
01:13:40.050 --> 01:13:43.520
<v Speaker 4>He just got emotional and crazy and he</v>
<v Speaker 4>charged after Steve Bay and steep based</v>

1778
01:13:43.521 --> 01:13:44.400
<v Speaker 4>that fucking good.</v>

1779
01:13:44.460 --> 01:13:45.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he is.</v>

1780
01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:48.100
<v Speaker 4>He's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean Steve Bay is a bad motherfucker.</v>

1781
01:13:48.101 --> 01:13:50.820
<v Speaker 4>It was no doubt about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a deserving world champion,</v>

1782
01:13:51.210 --> 01:13:52.810
<v Speaker 4>but man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just.</v>

1783
01:13:52.830 --> 01:13:56.190
<v Speaker 4>I would've loved to seen primetime cane</v>
<v Speaker 4>versus primetime fatal.</v>

1784
01:13:56.220 --> 01:13:58.410
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd love to say to you and I maintained</v>

1785
01:13:58.411 --> 01:14:02.180
<v Speaker 4>that Cain is the most intimidating</v>
<v Speaker 4>figure in the heavyweight division that</v>

1786
01:14:02.250 --> 01:14:04.680
<v Speaker 4>even though he's jerking the curtain on</v>
<v Speaker 4>Saturday night for the,</v>

1787
01:14:04.710 --> 01:14:08.130
<v Speaker 4>for the biggest card ever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he is the most intimidating guy in the</v>

1788
01:14:08.131 --> 01:14:10.410
<v Speaker 4>back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a jerk in the curtain jerk and the</v>

1789
01:14:10.411 --> 01:14:13.120
<v Speaker 4>curtain is the guy that starts the show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got to pull the curtain out of</v>

1790
01:14:13.121 --> 01:14:16.930
<v Speaker 4>the way to start the show that every</v>
<v Speaker 4>started as he started on Saturday night.</v>

1791
01:14:16.931 --> 01:14:17.720
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got the heavy,</v>

1792
01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:21.730
<v Speaker 4>the former heavyweight champion who's</v>
<v Speaker 4>headlining cards and had bills with his</v>

1793
01:14:21.731 --> 01:14:23.980
<v Speaker 4>name on the top of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now a sudden he's jerking the curtain</v>

1794
01:14:24.590 --> 01:14:25.690
<v Speaker 4>because it's UFC 200.</v>

1795
01:14:25.730 --> 01:14:27.490
<v Speaker 4>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was the biggest car there was,</v>

1796
01:14:27.491 --> 01:14:28.660
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>performance.</v>

1797
01:14:28.661 --> 01:14:31.450
<v Speaker 4>He had great performance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Travis Browne is nobody's fool.</v>

1798
01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:32.980
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Travis Browne is ranked number four in</v>

1799
01:14:32.981 --> 01:14:34.810
<v Speaker 4>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was ranked number three and he should be</v>

1800
01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:37.360
<v Speaker 4>one of the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Travis caught him clean straight right</v>

1801
01:14:37.361 --> 01:14:39.940
<v Speaker 4>hand at first round.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the few guys to beat Josh Barnett</v>

1802
01:14:39.941 --> 01:14:42.540
<v Speaker 4>and Travis is a good heavy weight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You need to be a basketball player.</v>

1803
01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:45.520
<v Speaker 4>You talked about steep a minute ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Steve plays a good athlete and we don't</v>

1804
01:14:45.521 --> 01:14:46.660
<v Speaker 4>have a ton of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1805
01:14:46.661 --> 01:14:48.430
<v Speaker 4>some of the great athletes that are that</v>
<v Speaker 4>size.</v>

1806
01:14:48.700 --> 01:14:51.400
<v Speaker 4>They go into some other professions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't usually get them in this one.</v>

1807
01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:54.310
<v Speaker 4>Steve Bay's a good looking heavyweight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He moves well.</v>

1808
01:14:54.311 --> 01:14:56.140
<v Speaker 4>He works hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got the wrestling background,</v>

1809
01:14:56.410 --> 01:14:58.600
<v Speaker 4>played baseball.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's just a good guy,</v>

<v Speaker 4>What the fuck are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then he gets taken down.</v>

1825
01:15:29.860 --> 01:15:30.730
<v Speaker 4>Chris.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

1826
01:15:30.731 --> 01:15:32.170
<v Speaker 4>And it wasn't a good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll kick.</v>

1827
01:15:32.171 --> 01:15:33.580
<v Speaker 4>It was goofy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll kick.</v>

1828
01:15:33.970 --> 01:15:35.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just didn't look right,</v>

1829
01:15:35.261 --> 01:15:36.480
<v Speaker 4>but when you saw throw,</v>
<v Speaker 4>throw,</v>

1830
01:15:36.490 --> 01:15:37.660
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh that's perfect.</v>

1831
01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:39.010
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's,</v>

1832
01:15:39.330 --> 01:15:40.900
<v Speaker 4>that's how he executes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Punches,</v>

1833
01:15:40.930 --> 01:15:42.020
<v Speaker 4>kicks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>takedowns.</v>

1834
01:15:42.100 --> 01:15:44.260
<v Speaker 4>Everything is perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no wind up.</v>

1835
01:15:44.290 --> 01:15:46.690
<v Speaker 4>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nothing has like extra horsepower behind</v>

1836
01:15:46.691 --> 01:15:48.280
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything's precise.</v>

1837
01:15:48.580 --> 01:15:51.010
<v Speaker 4>He's one of my favorite all time guys to</v>
<v Speaker 4>watch because of that.</v>

1838
01:15:51.070 --> 01:15:51.940
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I agree with that.</v>

1839
01:15:51.941 --> 01:15:54.670
<v Speaker 4>And that's your porn on for June.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So for doing beats fader who might be</v>

1840
01:15:54.671 --> 01:15:55.020
<v Speaker 4>the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Great.</v>

1841
01:15:55.020 --> 01:15:56.740
<v Speaker 4>So you say you don't know who the</v>
<v Speaker 4>greatest ever was.</v>

1842
01:15:56.741 --> 01:16:00.010
<v Speaker 4>It was it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was it a fader or was it cane?</v>

1843
01:16:01.420 --> 01:16:03.040
<v Speaker 4>Verdugo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Unbeatable for doom.</v>

1844
01:16:03.041 --> 01:16:05.490
<v Speaker 4>Doesn't end up in the conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's one of those does things.</v>

1845
01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:07.240
<v Speaker 4>He does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he does,</v>

1846
01:16:07.300 --> 01:16:09.730
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean because you got to think the</v>

1847
01:16:09.731 --> 01:16:14.230
<v Speaker 4>Prime Verducci who beat feet or the</v>
<v Speaker 4>prime for doom that beat cain could</v>

1848
01:16:14.231 --> 01:16:16.030
<v Speaker 4>probably have beaten those guys no</v>
<v Speaker 4>matter where.</v>

1849
01:16:16.090 --> 01:16:18.190
<v Speaker 4>It's very possible he could have beaten</v>
<v Speaker 4>those guys no matter what.</v>

1850
01:16:18.191 --> 01:16:19.930
<v Speaker 4>So I think he does go into the</v>
<v Speaker 4>conversation.</v>

1851
01:16:19.931 --> 01:16:24.230
<v Speaker 4>It's just the history,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that cane hat and the history that fade</v>

1852
01:16:24.231 --> 01:16:28.060
<v Speaker 4>or had mean canes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>insane wars and the way broke down</v>

1853
01:16:28.061 --> 01:16:30.250
<v Speaker 4>junior dos Santos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it gets knocked out in the first fight</v>

1854
01:16:30.430 --> 01:16:34.120
<v Speaker 4>and then the next two fights just puts</v>
<v Speaker 4>off fucking helacious beating on him.</v>

1855
01:16:34.150 --> 01:16:36.950
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think points,</v>

1856
01:16:37.150 --> 01:16:38.110
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the MMA,</v>

1857
01:16:38.111 --> 01:16:39.310
<v Speaker 4>math sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

1858
01:16:39.530 --> 01:16:40.690
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just,</v>

1859
01:16:40.691 --> 01:16:42.640
<v Speaker 4>it's real hard to say this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>be that guy.</v>

1860
01:16:42.641 --> 01:16:44.530
<v Speaker 4>So He's number one and that guy beat</v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy.</v>

1861
01:16:44.531 --> 01:16:46.270
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when you talk about it,</v>

1862
01:16:46.350 --> 01:16:49.390
<v Speaker 4>what are the elements that comes in is</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the guys wins and losses and his</v>

1863
01:16:49.391 --> 01:16:51.620
<v Speaker 4>skills.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's also an intimidation factor right?</v>

1864
01:16:51.690 --> 01:16:53.830
<v Speaker 4>What kind of intimidation they have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what we're doing know,</v>

1865
01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:56.530
<v Speaker 4>mix the joker face,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he's always teasing around so he</v>

1866
01:16:56.531 --> 01:16:58.270
<v Speaker 4>gets overlooked,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think that's fair.</v>

1867
01:16:58.271 --> 01:16:59.560
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the same thing's happening to bisping.</v>

1868
01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:01.900
<v Speaker 4>Weidman comes out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he says,</v>

1869
01:17:01.901 --> 01:17:05.380
<v Speaker 4>bisping's the most undeserving person of</v>
<v Speaker 4>all time to end up at a title spot,</v>

1870
01:17:05.740 --> 01:17:07.920
<v Speaker 4>and I'm going to time timeout and</v>
<v Speaker 4>Christmas a start.</v>

1871
01:17:07.930 --> 01:17:10.310
<v Speaker 4>But Chris Timeout.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You become famous</v>

1872
01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:13.040
<v Speaker 2>and world champion by beating Anderson</v>
<v Speaker 2>Silva.</v>

1873
01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:15.980
<v Speaker 2>Bisping just beat the same guy that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>beat.</v>

1874
01:17:16.310 --> 01:17:19.130
<v Speaker 2>Bisbing just beat the same guy that puts</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself over.</v>

1875
01:17:19.131 --> 01:17:20.890
<v Speaker 2>Why does it not put bisbing over?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now?</v>

1876
01:17:20.891 --> 01:17:24.540
<v Speaker 2>He just beats rockhold who beat you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And but bisping still not over.</v>

1877
01:17:24.541 --> 01:17:25.880
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of a weird thing.</v>

1878
01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:30.290
<v Speaker 1>Not only does it put bisping over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but bisping beat rockhold.</v>

1879
01:17:30.291 --> 01:17:33.380
<v Speaker 1>When rockhold was fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't clowning around.</v>

1880
01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:36.770
<v Speaker 1>When when Chris beat Anderson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he beat him twice.</v>

1881
01:17:36.890 --> 01:17:38.570
<v Speaker 1>He beat him once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When Anderson dropped,</v>

1882
01:17:38.571 --> 01:17:41.990
<v Speaker 1>his hands was being silly and he got</v>
<v Speaker 1>cracked and everybody was like,</v>

1883
01:17:41.991 --> 01:17:44.330
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe Anderson did that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

1884
01:17:44.510 --> 01:17:47.570
<v Speaker 1>it was a terrible way to lose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't just that they were going to</v>

1885
01:17:47.571 --> 01:17:50.000
<v Speaker 1>exchange and Chris landed a bomb of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>left hook.</v>

1886
01:17:50.210 --> 01:17:52.400
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was anderson was pretending to be</v>

1887
01:17:52.401 --> 01:17:56.270
<v Speaker 1>hurt and then he was like faking</v>
<v Speaker 1>wobbling and trying to duck out of the</v>

1888
01:17:56.271 --> 01:17:58.580
<v Speaker 1>way of punches like he always does and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris cracked him.</v>

1889
01:17:58.940 --> 01:18:02.640
<v Speaker 1>Then the second fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he breaks his leg and he throws,</v>

1890
01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:04.580
<v Speaker 1>throws a Kyc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>checks it and breaks late.</v>

1891
01:18:04.581 --> 01:18:09.140
<v Speaker 1>Granted Chris beat the shit out of them</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first round and almost like head.</v>

1892
01:18:09.150 --> 01:18:12.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm in bad trouble in that first round.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Controlled them on the ground,</v>

1893
01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:14.720
<v Speaker 1>beat him up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they go into the second round.</v>

1894
01:18:14.810 --> 01:18:17.930
<v Speaker 1>He breaks his leg and the second part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those are more freakish.</v>

1895
01:18:18.020 --> 01:18:19.580
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then what bisping debt,</v>

1896
01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:23.480
<v Speaker 1>what bisbing did is just straight up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he fucking landed a beautiful left hook,</v>

1897
01:18:23.540 --> 01:18:26.150
<v Speaker 1>heard them moved in for the kill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>closed the show,</v>

1898
01:18:26.420 --> 01:18:28.160
<v Speaker 1>legit champion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent.</v>

1899
01:18:28.161 --> 01:18:28.880
<v Speaker 1>No controversy.</v>

1900
01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:31.600
<v Speaker 2>I've tried fully agree with that and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>love this next match up.</v>

1901
01:18:31.601 --> 01:18:33.050
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you heard it's going to be Dan Henderson</v>

1902
01:18:33.051 --> 01:18:35.510
<v Speaker 2>and that doesn't go in the rankings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get all of that,</v>

1903
01:18:35.511 --> 01:18:37.610
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked the UFC when they make the</v>

1904
01:18:37.611 --> 01:18:40.070
<v Speaker 2>matches that people want to see and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an interesting match.</v>

1905
01:18:40.100 --> 01:18:42.590
<v Speaker 2>If you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you think this is going to just go in</v>

1906
01:18:42.591 --> 01:18:44.150
<v Speaker 2>and beat him or you look at dance</v>
<v Speaker 2>record,</v>

1907
01:18:44.151 --> 01:18:46.100
<v Speaker 2>you think that bisping doesn't go to bed</v>
<v Speaker 2>at night.</v>

1908
01:18:46.101 --> 01:18:48.200
<v Speaker 2>Remember on what that was like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The teasing,</v>

1909
01:18:48.201 --> 01:18:50.830
<v Speaker 2>the highlight reel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the people to everybody telling them</v>

1910
01:18:50.831 --> 01:18:51.321
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1911
01:18:51.321 --> 01:18:56.321
<v Speaker 2>making fun of him flying through the air</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he pounded bisbing just to hit.</v>

1912
01:18:57.140 --> 01:18:58.400
<v Speaker 2>It was more conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1913
01:18:58.520 --> 01:18:59.720
<v Speaker 2>that's his logo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1914
01:19:00.020 --> 01:19:01.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is highlight reel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>knockout.</v>

1915
01:19:01.521 --> 01:19:03.290
<v Speaker 2>I stayed at Dan Henderson's house for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>month,</v>

1916
01:19:03.291 --> 01:19:06.560
<v Speaker 2>helping them train for [inaudible] and</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you turn dance tv off at night,</v>

1917
01:19:06.561 --> 01:19:10.450
<v Speaker 2>the remote control says lights out and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's him hitting bisping lights up.</v>

1918
01:19:10.770 --> 01:19:12.830
<v Speaker 2>That's what lights up on his remote</v>
<v Speaker 2>control.</v>

1919
01:19:12.831 --> 01:19:17.240
<v Speaker 2>So I mean he doesn't have confidence</v>
<v Speaker 2>going into the shittiest competence.</v>

1920
01:19:17.241 --> 01:19:18.470
<v Speaker 2>He knows he could beat him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He already did.</v>

1921
01:19:18.471 --> 01:19:19.760
<v Speaker 2>If you think bespeaks not going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1922
01:19:19.761 --> 01:19:21.440
<v Speaker 2>I really don't want to be in there with</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy again.</v>

1923
01:19:21.441 --> 01:19:23.100
<v Speaker 2>He's going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want that one back and one,</v>

1924
01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:24.980
<v Speaker 2>he's going to say all those things and</v>
<v Speaker 2>try to convince himself,</v>

1925
01:19:24.981 --> 01:19:28.220
<v Speaker 2>but the bottom line is that's relevant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dan Henderson will be the world</v>

1926
01:19:28.221 --> 01:19:30.050
<v Speaker 2>champion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very possible,</v>

1927
01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:31.470
<v Speaker 2>very possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look.</v>

1928
01:19:31.550 --> 01:19:35.530
<v Speaker 2>He just knocked Hector Lombard dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hector's tougher and health tech.</v>

1929
01:19:35.531 --> 01:19:38.360
<v Speaker 2>There's never been given the credit that</v>
<v Speaker 2>he deserved a monster.</v>

1930
01:19:38.390 --> 01:19:40.370
<v Speaker 2>Monster fights it two different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1931
01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:44.120
<v Speaker 1>Nicholas Power and he had Dan hirt and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dan had hit her.</v>

1932
01:19:44.220 --> 01:19:45.840
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dan hurt him first.</v>

1933
01:19:45.930 --> 01:19:47.400
<v Speaker 1>Hector came back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hurt Dan.</v>

1934
01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:52.700
<v Speaker 1>Dan recovered and knocked him out with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy fucking elbow and then another</v>

1935
01:19:53.011 --> 01:19:56.130
<v Speaker 1>shot when once he moves basically out</v>
<v Speaker 1>from that back elbow,</v>

1936
01:19:56.580 --> 01:20:01.380
<v Speaker 1>but it shows that Dan can still shut the</v>
<v Speaker 1>lights out on a guy in his prime who's a</v>

1937
01:20:01.381 --> 01:20:03.480
<v Speaker 1>destroyer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's never been knocked out before in</v>

1938
01:20:03.481 --> 01:20:04.080
<v Speaker 1>the aunt.</v>

1939
01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:05.550
<v Speaker 2>I fully agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Disagree.</v>

1940
01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:08.220
<v Speaker 2>There's one of those guys of what</v>
<v Speaker 2>happens</v>

1941
01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:09.750
<v Speaker 4>to them and hector stubbed his toe a few</v>
<v Speaker 4>times.</v>

1942
01:20:09.751 --> 01:20:12.510
<v Speaker 4>You want to see hector fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hector's got the whole thing.</v>

1943
01:20:12.511 --> 01:20:14.790
<v Speaker 4>He's going to do the promos before and</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's going to mean it.</v>

1944
01:20:14.791 --> 01:20:16.620
<v Speaker 4>He's going to hate that opponent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's real,</v>

1945
01:20:16.621 --> 01:20:19.140
<v Speaker 4>he's going to look like a million bucks</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he's going to come out fight and</v>

1946
01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:22.290
<v Speaker 4>whatever happens after that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's coming to fight when he went</v>

1947
01:20:22.291 --> 01:20:23.750
<v Speaker 4>out on his shield.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1948
01:20:23.790 --> 01:20:27.120
<v Speaker 4>and when you look at this fight between</v>
<v Speaker 4>bisping and Henderson,</v>

1949
01:20:27.150 --> 01:20:29.010
<v Speaker 4>that's the most exciting fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1950
01:20:29.011 --> 01:20:30.810
<v Speaker 4>that's why I liked the fact that the UFC</v>
<v Speaker 4>made it.</v>

1951
01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:33.210
<v Speaker 4>That's the fight that I wanted to see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I put it on my instagram.</v>

1952
01:20:33.211 --> 01:20:33.750
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>come,</v>

1953
01:20:33.750 --> 01:20:34.560
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>please,</v>

1954
01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:35.880
<v Speaker 4>please,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's make it happen.</v>

1955
01:20:35.881 --> 01:20:36.691
<v Speaker 4>Let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1956
01:20:36.691 --> 01:20:38.400
<v Speaker 4>That's the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if Dan goes out,</v>

1957
01:20:38.550 --> 01:20:39.670
<v Speaker 4>Dan came to my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1958
01:20:39.860 --> 01:20:41.220
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his fight was on a Saturday.</v>

1959
01:20:41.220 --> 01:20:44.580
<v Speaker 4>He came to my show at the Ice House in</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pasadena on Wednesday.</v>

1960
01:20:44.700 --> 01:20:47.520
<v Speaker 4>He said he had been drunk since</v>
<v Speaker 4>Saturday.</v>

1961
01:20:49.380 --> 01:20:53.070
<v Speaker 4>That sounds great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was so happy.</v>

1962
01:20:53.071 --> 01:20:53.701
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1963
01:20:53.701 --> 01:20:55.050
<v Speaker 4>what do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it possible?</v>

1964
01:20:55.090 --> 01:20:56.190
<v Speaker 4>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're trying,</v>

1965
01:20:56.191 --> 01:20:58.550
<v Speaker 4>we're trying to make that happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the bisping fight.</v>

1966
01:20:58.551 --> 01:21:00.180
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is the fight to make.</v>

1967
01:21:00.330 --> 01:21:02.040
<v Speaker 4>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>would you retire if,</v>

1968
01:21:02.060 --> 01:21:03.600
<v Speaker 4>if that would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you went out with that,</v>

1969
01:21:03.620 --> 01:21:04.453
<v Speaker 4>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

1970
01:21:04.530 --> 01:21:06.060
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he goes as the only fight I want right</v>

1971
01:21:06.061 --> 01:21:06.571
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It goes,</v>

1972
01:21:06.571 --> 01:21:08.340
<v Speaker 4>I don't even really want to fight</v>
<v Speaker 4>anybody else.</v>

1973
01:21:08.341 --> 01:21:10.680
<v Speaker 4>I want to fight him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then I think I'm done now.</v>

1974
01:21:10.681 --> 01:21:13.980
<v Speaker 4>What about what George St Pierre was</v>
<v Speaker 4>saying he would come back and he wanted</v>

1975
01:21:13.990 --> 01:21:15.930
<v Speaker 4>bisping and if George comes to the table</v>
<v Speaker 4>and says,</v>

1976
01:21:15.931 --> 01:21:17.280
<v Speaker 4>I'll come back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but only if.</v>

1977
01:21:17.310 --> 01:21:19.680
<v Speaker 4>Well then it's only if you're doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're doing that.</v>

1978
01:21:20.100 --> 01:21:22.890
<v Speaker 4>That's a big fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If he comes back and fights bisping.</v>

1979
01:21:22.950 --> 01:21:25.200
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it's a bigger fight than</v>
<v Speaker 4>Henderson.</v>

1980
01:21:25.380 --> 01:21:28.230
<v Speaker 4>I agree that it doesn't sell more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm saying if that's what you gotta</v>

1981
01:21:28.231 --> 01:21:30.340
<v Speaker 4>do to get George back to the table,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

1982
01:21:30.430 --> 01:21:32.040
<v Speaker 4>I think you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't if you're Dana,</v>

1983
01:21:32.041 --> 01:21:32.810
<v Speaker 4>don't you do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1984
01:21:32.810 --> 01:21:34.500
<v Speaker 4>You don't think that's what you need to</v>
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>

1985
01:21:34.530 --> 01:21:37.860
<v Speaker 4>I think he's just saying that because</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's an attractive option because you</v>

1986
01:21:37.861 --> 01:21:40.380
<v Speaker 4>know bisping has the title.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an interesting fight.</v>

1987
01:21:40.381 --> 01:21:41.910
<v Speaker 4>He wouldn't have to cut weight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mean literally.</v>

1988
01:21:41.911 --> 01:21:44.760
<v Speaker 4>He's walking around at one 86.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a much larger.</v>

1989
01:21:44.761 --> 01:21:48.750
<v Speaker 4>Got Larger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You think that Dana told George?</v>

1990
01:21:48.751 --> 01:21:49.680
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1991
01:21:49.740 --> 01:21:50.880
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to do that match.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1992
01:21:50.881 --> 01:21:54.450
<v Speaker 4>I just think they probably didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Didn't really have it worked out.</v>

1993
01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:56.610
<v Speaker 4>They were probably discussing it and</v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to figure out what the details</v>

1994
01:21:56.611 --> 01:21:59.220
<v Speaker 4>would be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you look at the most attractive</v>

1995
01:21:59.221 --> 01:22:01.710
<v Speaker 4>fight to Bisping,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would think the Henderson fight would</v>

1996
01:22:01.711 --> 01:22:03.930
<v Speaker 4>be because Dan doesn't have much time</v>
<v Speaker 4>left.</v>

1997
01:22:03.930 --> 01:22:06.510
<v Speaker 4>If he misses them this time around,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he might not ever be able to fight them</v>

1998
01:22:06.511 --> 01:22:09.120
<v Speaker 4>again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This being legitimately wants to get</v>

1999
01:22:09.121 --> 01:22:12.780
<v Speaker 4>revenge and he's the world champion now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's his call,</v>

2000
01:22:12.810 --> 01:22:15.900
<v Speaker 4>so Kudos to him for taking this fight</v>
<v Speaker 4>for saying,</v>

2001
01:22:15.901 --> 01:22:17.540
<v Speaker 4>you know what man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy just blew.</v>

2002
01:22:17.580 --> 01:22:20.190
<v Speaker 4>It's not like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not like he called them out right</v>

2003
01:22:20.191 --> 01:22:21.570
<v Speaker 4>after.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just got knocked out in the first</v>

2004
01:22:21.571 --> 01:22:25.620
<v Speaker 4>round by [inaudible] know you called</v>
<v Speaker 4>them out after you just destroyed Hector</v>

2005
01:22:25.620 --> 01:22:29.850
<v Speaker 4>Lombard and like that was one of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>greatest knockouts in the history of the</v>

2006
01:22:29.851 --> 01:22:31.440
<v Speaker 4>sport.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean when that happened,</v>

2007
01:22:31.441 --> 01:22:35.910
<v Speaker 4>because when you consider all that was</v>
<v Speaker 4>at stake when you consider that Dan was</v>

2008
01:22:35.911 --> 01:22:37.920
<v Speaker 4>45 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that people thought he was in the</v>

2009
01:22:37.921 --> 01:22:41.010
<v Speaker 4>twilight of his career.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That he's stepping in there to fight</v>

2010
01:22:41.011 --> 01:22:43.860
<v Speaker 4>hector.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lumbar was just a fucking monster in his</v>

2011
01:22:43.861 --> 01:22:46.440
<v Speaker 4>prime.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that was a great knockout.</v>

2012
01:22:46.441 --> 01:22:50.160
<v Speaker 4>An all time great result.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So Kudos to bisping.</v>

2013
01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:54.450
<v Speaker 4>Kudos to bisping for wanting that fight</v>
<v Speaker 4>now and the way bisping needs to handle</v>

2014
01:22:54.451 --> 01:22:57.720
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you factor Shaka Ryan,</v>

2015
01:22:57.750 --> 01:22:58.321
<v Speaker 4>who's going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

2016
01:22:58.321 --> 01:22:59.670
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have beaten you.</v>

2017
01:22:59.671 --> 01:23:01.830
<v Speaker 4>I got the skills to beat you on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>number one contender.</v>

2018
01:23:02.100 --> 01:23:03.990
<v Speaker 4>Here's how bisping we'll handle it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2019
01:23:03.991 --> 01:23:05.010
<v Speaker 4>you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wait your.</v>

2020
01:23:05.260 --> 01:23:06.093
<v Speaker 4>That's how they'll handle</v>

2021
01:23:06.220 --> 01:23:07.960
<v Speaker 3>the way to shut those guys down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe.</v>

2022
01:23:08.180 --> 01:23:09.820
<v Speaker 3>It's to go back to the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the truth,</v>

2023
01:23:09.821 --> 01:23:10.560
<v Speaker 3>your friend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>

2024
01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:12.430
<v Speaker 3>Jacques Rey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're more dangerous.</v>

2025
01:23:12.431 --> 01:23:15.550
<v Speaker 3>You're more likely to beat me and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>not looking to get beat,</v>

2026
01:23:15.551 --> 01:23:18.820
<v Speaker 3>so I'm going to go deal with this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It shuts everything.</v>

2027
01:23:18.821 --> 01:23:20.540
<v Speaker 3>A bisbing won't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody likes to go,</v>

2028
01:23:20.541 --> 01:23:22.860
<v Speaker 3>well wait your turn and this and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not as good as you think you are.</v>

2029
01:23:22.900 --> 01:23:24.640
<v Speaker 3>Go fight your over America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever it is,</v>

2030
01:23:24.850 --> 01:23:26.290
<v Speaker 3>steer right into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah man,</v>

2031
01:23:26.291 --> 01:23:28.090
<v Speaker 3>you're way more like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's what I want to do.</v>

2032
01:23:28.420 --> 01:23:31.840
<v Speaker 3>I want to fight the easiest guy in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>biggest stadium for the largest paycheck</v>

2033
01:23:31.841 --> 01:23:33.370
<v Speaker 3>and that's what I'm going to politic to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

2034
01:23:33.371 --> 01:23:34.840
<v Speaker 3>So you do your thing and I'm going to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>mine.</v>

2035
01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:36.033
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Socceroos,</v>

2036
01:23:36.060 --> 01:23:36.710
<v Speaker 3>is that right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2037
01:23:36.710 --> 01:23:40.090
<v Speaker 1>Not very good for JOC ray,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he lost the fight with your</v>

2038
01:23:40.100 --> 01:23:41.440
<v Speaker 1>Ramiro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I for some reason.</v>

2039
01:23:41.860 --> 01:23:42.940
<v Speaker 1>Erroneous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2040
01:23:43.150 --> 01:23:46.060
<v Speaker 1>I had an erroneous memory of jock or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>winning the decision.</v>

2041
01:23:46.061 --> 01:23:48.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's because of him testing</v>

2042
01:23:48.701 --> 01:23:50.680
<v Speaker 1>positive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was a very close fight too.</v>

2043
01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:52.540
<v Speaker 1>I remember not knowing after it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>

2044
01:23:52.541 --> 01:23:56.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean I remember you well blasted them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and had them really badly hurt,</v>

2045
01:23:56.411 --> 01:24:00.070
<v Speaker 1>but I felt like Zachary came back a bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was a very close fight towards</v>

2046
01:24:00.071 --> 01:24:01.130
<v Speaker 1>the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's very tough.</v>

2047
01:24:01.150 --> 01:24:03.850
<v Speaker 1>I agree with the decision popped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can see it.</v>

2048
01:24:03.851 --> 01:24:04.960
<v Speaker 1>It was tight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jacques raised.</v>

2049
01:24:05.230 --> 01:24:07.780
<v Speaker 1>He's fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're both fantastic.</v>

2050
01:24:07.810 --> 01:24:08.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they really are.</v>

2051
01:24:09.070 --> 01:24:12.430
<v Speaker 1>And when he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he lost that fight though,</v>

2052
01:24:12.670 --> 01:24:16.810
<v Speaker 1>it's real hard to lose a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if a guy that popped for a tainted</v>

2053
01:24:16.811 --> 01:24:20.410
<v Speaker 1>supplement that mean they only give them</v>
<v Speaker 1>a six month suspension,</v>

2054
01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:23.380
<v Speaker 1>it's real hard to make an argument that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you deserve the next shot at the title.</v>

2055
01:24:23.381 --> 01:24:25.480
<v Speaker 1>I think that actually solidifies dance</v>

2056
01:24:25.510 --> 01:24:26.560
<v Speaker 3>position.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

2057
01:24:26.650 --> 01:24:28.000
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can I switch gears?</v>

2058
01:24:28.030 --> 01:24:28.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to ask you about.</v>

2059
01:24:28.970 --> 01:24:30.910
<v Speaker 3>You asked me about anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joey Diaz.</v>

01:24:38.860 --> 01:24:41.200

<v Speaker 3>How did he come into the fold?</v>

2064
01:24:41.250 --> 01:24:44.690
<v Speaker 1>I met Joey Diaz in the late nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2065
01:24:44.700 --> 01:24:47.280
<v Speaker 1>at the comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I met him in like [inaudible] 96</v>

2066
01:24:47.281 --> 01:24:48.720
<v Speaker 1>or 97,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

2067
01:24:49.130 --> 01:24:51.510
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right when Joey moved to La,</v>

2068
01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:53.100
<v Speaker 1>we just started hanging around the</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy store.</v>

2069
01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:56.190
<v Speaker 1>We became friends and then I started</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking on the road with me.</v>

2070
01:24:56.880 --> 01:24:57.740
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2071
01:24:57.800 --> 01:25:00.870
<v Speaker 1>the late nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've been best friends forever,</v>

2072
01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:04.330
<v Speaker 3>so I know of Joey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know Joey.</v>

2073
01:25:04.540 --> 01:25:06.260
<v Speaker 3>I've never met him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never met Joe.</v>

2074
01:25:06.261 --> 01:25:09.760
<v Speaker 3>Whenever I call him up right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>TV and the whole bit and you know,</v>

2075
01:25:09.761 --> 01:25:12.250

<v Speaker 3>from you and I see your podcast and all</v>

2076

2078
01:25:14.561 --> 01:25:16.690
<v Speaker 3>he's funnier than hell and he's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>gangster.</v>

2079
01:25:16.691 --> 01:25:18.610
<v Speaker 3>So I like him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know anything about him.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Joey,</v>

2087
01:25:32.890 --> 01:25:34.900

<v Speaker 3>And his response,</v>

2088
01:25:35.710 --> 01:25:37.750
<v Speaker 3>you know Chael Sonnen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wouldn't call me jail.</v>

2089
01:25:37.751 --> 01:25:40.330
<v Speaker 3>It was always.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She calls me Joe Rogan.</v>

2090
01:25:41.450 --> 01:25:45.250
<v Speaker 3>I'm mugged a hooker down in New Jersey</v>
<v Speaker 3>and senator Lee said her wig on fire.</v>

2091
01:25:47.410 --> 01:25:48.370
<v Speaker 3>It's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got to.</v>

2092
01:25:48.371 --> 01:25:50.110
<v Speaker 3>There's two moving parts here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First off,</v>

2093
01:25:50.111 --> 01:25:52.000
<v Speaker 3>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how that answers my</v>

2094
01:25:52.001 --> 01:25:55.420
<v Speaker 3>question of how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now I need to know the story here.</v>

2095
01:25:55.421 --> 01:25:59.080
<v Speaker 3>So we ties it all together with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He went on something,</v>

2096
01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:00.790
<v Speaker 3>just something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he got an appearance.</v>

2097
01:26:00.791 --> 01:26:04.010
<v Speaker 3>He told the story of mugging her a</v>
<v Speaker 3>hooker in New Jersey and setting her wig</v>

2098
01:26:04.011 --> 01:26:06.710
<v Speaker 3>on fire and all of a sudden he blew up</v>
<v Speaker 3>overnight and he goes,</v>

2099
01:26:06.711 --> 01:26:08.120
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I realized people like the stores.</v>

2100
01:26:08.121 --> 01:26:11.180
<v Speaker 3>I never knew that I had stories from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of the country.</v>

2101
01:26:11.181 --> 01:26:13.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm in the neighborhood I grew up in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought everybody had these doors.</v>

2102
01:26:13.911 --> 01:26:14.531
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chill son.</v>

2103
01:26:14.531 --> 01:26:17.060
<v Speaker 3>And I thought I'd tell you I mogul</v>
<v Speaker 3>hooker and lighter wig on fire.</v>

<v Speaker 3>well I'm up 10 hookers and let 10 wigs</v>
<v Speaker 3>on fire.</v>

2106
01:26:20.140 --> 01:26:22.610
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know I had stories and then it</v>

2107
01:26:22.611 --> 01:26:23.750
<v Speaker 3>just goes from there.</v>

2108
01:26:23.750 --> 01:26:25.880
<v Speaker 3>And he starts telling me about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So He.</v>

2109
01:26:26.170 --> 01:26:28.550
<v Speaker 3>So he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he ends up doing two years or 18 months</v>

2110
01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:29.420
<v Speaker 3>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2111
01:26:29.420 --> 01:26:31.190
<v Speaker 3>what kind of jam did you get in there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>

2112
01:26:31.191 --> 01:26:32.330
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was actually,</v>

2113
01:26:32.331 --> 01:26:33.860
<v Speaker 3>I was doing the cop's job for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2114
01:26:33.861 --> 01:26:35.330
<v Speaker 3>the cops don't want drugs on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>streets.</v>

2115
01:26:35.331 --> 01:26:37.640
<v Speaker 3>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>took two kilos off the streets form.</v>

2116
01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:40.430
<v Speaker 3>This is how he presents it to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

2117
01:26:40.431 --> 01:26:40.950
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2118
01:26:40.950 --> 01:26:41.210
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2119
01:26:41.210 --> 01:26:44.230
<v Speaker 3>the two kilos wasn't as big of a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>

2120
01:26:44.231 --> 01:26:44.910
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2121
01:26:44.910 --> 01:26:46.400
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I robbed two kilos.</v>

2122
01:26:46.401 --> 01:26:47.660
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know what else?</v>

2123
01:26:47.661 --> 01:26:50.300
<v Speaker 3>Chael Sonnen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just happened to have a machine gun</v>

2124
01:26:51.130 --> 01:26:53.020
<v Speaker 3>and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can see where that happened because</v>

2125
01:26:53.021 --> 01:26:54.910
<v Speaker 3>she is sometimes you just back into a</v>
<v Speaker 3>machine gun.</v>

2126
01:26:54.911 --> 01:26:57.350
<v Speaker 3>I had a machine gun with me and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's funny.</v>

2127
01:26:57.351 --> 01:26:58.700
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't in trouble for the gun.</v>

2128
01:26:58.700 --> 01:27:01.170
<v Speaker 3>I really wasn't that much trouble for</v>
<v Speaker 3>the drugs.</v>

2129
01:27:01.171 --> 01:27:03.230
<v Speaker 3>What they were upset about was the</v>
<v Speaker 3>kidnapping.</v>

2130
01:27:03.740 --> 01:27:04.311
<v Speaker 3>I'm going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2131
01:27:04.311 --> 01:27:06.000
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happened here?</v>

2132
01:27:06.010 --> 01:27:07.730
<v Speaker 3>This is my intro to the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2133
01:27:07.731 --> 01:27:09.410
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What in the hell is this story?</v>

2134
01:27:09.411 --> 01:27:10.880
<v Speaker 3>You probably know the story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I did it.</v>

2135
01:27:11.330 --> 01:27:13.040
<v Speaker 3>So he tells me the whole story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>

2136
01:27:13.041 --> 01:27:13.560
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

2137
01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:15.050
<v Speaker 3>kidnappings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of a weird charge.</v>

2138
01:27:15.051 --> 01:27:16.700
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you and vandelay gotten that</v>

2139
01:27:16.701 --> 01:27:19.700
<v Speaker 3>scuffle in the ultimate fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I come and grab you and take you into</v>

2140
01:27:19.701 --> 01:27:23.490
<v Speaker 3>the next room just to cool you down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>taking you into a room against your</v>

2141
01:27:23.491 --> 01:27:24.590
<v Speaker 3>will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's kidnapping.</v>

2142
01:27:24.770 --> 01:27:27.050
<v Speaker 3>So I think like they got him on a</v>
<v Speaker 3>technicality jam,</v>

2143
01:27:27.051 --> 01:27:29.330
<v Speaker 3>like what they're doing with Frank Mir.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of these guys were talking about</v>

2144
01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:30.710
<v Speaker 3>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2145
01:27:30.711 --> 01:27:31.880
<v Speaker 3>is that what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

2146
01:27:32.090 --> 01:27:33.520
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I duct taped the game.</v>

2147
01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:35.630
<v Speaker 3>He's in my trunk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I held him in the house for a</v>

2148
01:27:35.630 --> 01:27:38.390
<v Speaker 3>week before I let him go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well then why didn't you tell me?</v>

2149
01:27:38.660 --> 01:27:43.550
<v Speaker 3>Why did you bring up the initial example</v>
<v Speaker 3>of taking me next door and cooling me</v>

2150
01:27:43.551 --> 01:27:44.960
<v Speaker 3>debt?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What that have to do?</v>

2151
01:27:44.961 --> 01:27:48.800
<v Speaker 3>I still don't know because he's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's funnier than hell.</v>

2152
01:27:48.801 --> 01:27:50.920
<v Speaker 3>And I asked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was trying to talk like some.</v>

2153
01:27:51.050 --> 01:27:53.350
<v Speaker 3>See I try to do more of a Joe Rogan</v>
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>

2154
01:27:53.351 --> 01:27:54.230
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're my idol.</v>

2155
01:27:54.231 --> 01:27:56.600

<v Speaker 3>yours,</v>

2156
01:27:56.601 --> 01:27:58.730
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not there yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It takes a while to build that audience.</v>

2157
01:27:58.731 --> 01:28:01.160
<v Speaker 3>So I got a stick on MMA and pro</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrestling.</v>

2158
01:28:01.161 --> 01:28:03.020
<v Speaker 3>I got to really stay in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't want that.</v>

2159
01:28:03.021 --> 01:28:04.460
<v Speaker 3>I want just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to just talk.</v>

2160
01:28:04.500 --> 01:28:05.400
<v Speaker 3>You could just talk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You.</v>

2161
01:28:05.440 --> 01:28:07.580
<v Speaker 3>You definitely could just talk was I</v>
<v Speaker 3>bring these guys in.</v>

2162
01:28:07.580 --> 01:28:09.920
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to do a little more that I go</v>
<v Speaker 3>to Tmz,</v>

2163
01:28:09.921 --> 01:28:12.680
<v Speaker 3>I see the local stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I try to ask them pop culture questions.</v>

2164
01:28:12.681 --> 01:28:16.910
<v Speaker 3>So I dip my toe in politics with Joey</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obama had just made this new rule of</v>

2165
01:28:16.911 --> 01:28:20.060
<v Speaker 3>going to the bathroom you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I asked Joey about that and he goes,</v>

2166
01:28:20.061 --> 01:28:21.980
<v Speaker 3>chill son.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I've been taking a dump in the</v>

2167
01:28:21.981 --> 01:28:25.490
<v Speaker 3>woman's bathroom since I'm five years</v>
<v Speaker 3>old and believe me,</v>

2168
01:28:25.970 --> 01:28:30.970
<v Speaker 3>I have dealt with the consequences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he wasn't kidding Joe.</v>

2169
01:28:32.850 --> 01:28:35.630
<v Speaker 3>That's what's made this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a shoot.</v>

2170
01:28:35.631 --> 01:28:38.990
<v Speaker 3>He's being real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he tells me he is pro wrestling.</v>

2171
01:28:39.230 --> 01:28:39.621
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

<v Speaker 3>my mom used to own a restaurant so you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

2173
01:28:41.721 --> 01:28:44.060

<v Speaker 3>I cleaned the bag and then I sit down in</v>

2174
01:28:44.061 --> 01:28:44.721
<v Speaker 3>the women's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

2175
01:28:44.721 --> 01:28:47.630
<v Speaker 3>you know what happens if you drop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you drop your coke on a men's bathroom</v>

2176
01:28:47.631 --> 01:28:47.840
<v Speaker 3>floor.</v>

2177
01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:48.630
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2178
01:28:48.630 --> 01:28:52.340
<v Speaker 3>I don't do like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've tested positive for everything in</v>

2179
01:28:52.341 --> 01:28:53.890
<v Speaker 3>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but coke was at one of them.</v>

2180
01:28:54.170 --> 01:28:55.520
<v Speaker 3>I used.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you'd get down and lick it up.</v>

2183
01:29:00.710 --> 01:29:01.580
<v Speaker 3>That's what he.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>

2184
01:29:01.690 --> 01:29:03.860
<v Speaker 3>everybody's trying to say the women's</v>
<v Speaker 3>rooms cleaning he'd been used up,</v>

01:29:03.870 --> 01:29:07.650
<v Speaker 3>says he's five years old and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I have dealt with the consequences,</v>

2186
01:29:07.651 --> 01:29:10.590
<v Speaker 3>which I knew I want the answer to what</v>
<v Speaker 3>those were.</v>

2187
01:29:10.591 --> 01:29:12.390
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like there's too many other things</v>

2188

<v Speaker 3>but I got to get back to the hooker with</v>

2198
01:29:38.421 --> 01:29:41.390

01:32:36.340 --> 01:32:38.350
<v Speaker 4>But that was a funny line.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2277
01:32:39.350 --> 01:32:42.030
<v Speaker 4>You use like a paper view though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or.</v>

2278
01:32:42.550 --> 01:32:45.100
<v Speaker 4>I think it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was on fs one that was part of the</v>

2279
01:32:45.101 --> 01:32:46.390
<v Speaker 4>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2280
01:32:46.450 --> 01:32:47.800
<v Speaker 4>It works.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Martin Kampmann.</v>

2281
01:32:47.801 --> 01:32:49.690
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was Martin Cameron and uh,</v>

2282
01:32:49.691 --> 01:32:52.330
<v Speaker 4>I just wanted to credit him because it</v>
<v Speaker 4>made me laugh so hard.</v>

2283
01:32:52.330 --> 01:32:54.340
<v Speaker 4>That's why I said as my friend Adam</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hunter,</v>

2284
01:32:54.430 --> 01:32:56.590
<v Speaker 4>so I kind of got away with it because it</v>
<v Speaker 4>wasn't.</v>

2285
01:32:56.591 --> 01:32:59.360
<v Speaker 4>My joke is if I had said it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

2286
01:33:00.200 --> 01:33:01.031
<v Speaker 4>Well here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we're playing,</v>

2287
01:33:01.031 --> 01:33:02.770
<v Speaker 4>if we're playing that game,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't tell one,</v>

2288
01:33:02.830 --> 01:33:04.300
<v Speaker 4>but if I quote him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe I can't.</v>

2289
01:33:04.301 --> 01:33:07.030
<v Speaker 4>He sends me a text after the Orlando</v>
<v Speaker 4>shooting the very next day.</v>

2290
01:33:07.031 --> 01:33:07.780
<v Speaker 4>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey man,</v>

2291
01:33:07.780 --> 01:33:09.730
<v Speaker 4>let me know you're okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I heard there was a shooting at a gay</v>

2292
01:33:09.731 --> 01:33:10.810
<v Speaker 4>club.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just want to check on you.</v>

2293
01:33:11.270 --> 01:33:13.540
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now you got to do that in private.</v>

2294
01:33:13.640 --> 01:33:16.150
<v Speaker 4>You</v>
<v Speaker 4>can do anything.</v>

2295
01:33:16.151 --> 01:33:18.550
<v Speaker 4>They want this loophole.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hilarious.</v>

2296
01:33:18.551 --> 01:33:20.350
<v Speaker 4>I'm just reading that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's funny.</v>

2297
01:33:20.351 --> 01:33:22.090
<v Speaker 4>I wonder how many other people you said</v>
<v Speaker 4>that too,</v>

2298
01:33:22.091 --> 01:33:24.850
<v Speaker 4>but the right mark for that because</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's funny.</v>

2299
01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:26.590
<v Speaker 4>That's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is funny.</v>

2300
01:33:26.830 --> 01:33:27.980
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a weird position.</v>

2301
01:33:28.030 --> 01:33:28.990
<v Speaker 4>I believe in the rule,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joe.</v>

2302
01:33:28.990 --> 01:33:31.570
<v Speaker 4>If it's funny then you can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2303
01:33:31.660 --> 01:33:32.830
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well both.</v>

2304
01:33:32.920 --> 01:33:33.850
<v Speaker 4>Funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Subjective,</v>

2305
01:33:33.851 --> 01:33:35.110
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what's funded you?</v>

2306
01:33:35.260 --> 01:33:37.540
<v Speaker 4>Other people might get offended and</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's one of the things that people who</v>

2307
01:33:37.541 --> 01:33:41.080
<v Speaker 4>love to be recreationally outrage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what they do.</v>

2308
01:33:41.081 --> 01:33:43.150
<v Speaker 4>They'll find a joke and they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not funny to me.</v>

2309
01:33:43.151 --> 01:33:47.330
<v Speaker 4>It's horribly offensive and it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>degrading and blah blah,</v>

2310
01:33:47.380 --> 01:33:49.330
<v Speaker 4>and they'll come up with a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 4>reasons why.</v>

2311
01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:51.550
<v Speaker 4>It shouldn't be funny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if there's someone out there that's</v>

2312
01:33:51.551 --> 01:33:54.370
<v Speaker 4>howling at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're protesting the other person's</v>

2313
01:33:54.371 --> 01:33:57.730
<v Speaker 4>howling laughing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it did its job for you,</v>

2314
01:33:57.790 --> 01:33:59.620
<v Speaker 4>for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You sent out a great tweet.</v>

2315
01:33:59.700 --> 01:34:01.150
<v Speaker 4>You might.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It might've been as recently as</v>

2316
01:34:01.151 --> 01:34:03.460
<v Speaker 4>yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the for it was a two part.</v>

2317
01:34:03.580 --> 01:34:08.050
<v Speaker 4>The first part said this country does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This country has a mental health problem</v>

2318
01:34:08.051 --> 01:34:13.051
<v Speaker 4>disguised as a gun problem and this</v>
<v Speaker 4>country has a tyranny problem disguised</v>

2319
01:34:13.450 --> 01:34:14.590
<v Speaker 4>as a security problem.</v>

2320
01:34:14.590 --> 01:34:16.690
<v Speaker 4>It's a security problem and it went</v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy.</v>

2321
01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:18.330
<v Speaker 4>Twitter lit up and when I'm reading that</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going,</v>

2322
01:34:18.580 --> 01:34:20.860
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joe's dip it in something here.</v>

2323
01:34:20.861 --> 01:34:23.650
<v Speaker 4>Joe Doesn't usually dip in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's right.</v>

2324
01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:26.860
<v Speaker 4>There was no way to say that that</v>
<v Speaker 4>statement is not right and it wasn't</v>

2325
01:34:26.861 --> 01:34:29.830
<v Speaker 4>meant to be funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was a very true and I thought a</v>

2326
01:34:29.831 --> 01:34:31.360
<v Speaker 4>powerful statement by you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

2327
01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:33.600
<v Speaker 4>It's actually a couple of years old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just a,</v>

2328
01:34:34.050 --> 01:34:36.370
<v Speaker 4>it's just going around a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People who are retweeting it.</v>

2329
01:34:36.371 --> 01:34:37.300
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Came back,</v>

2330
01:34:37.330 --> 01:34:40.960
<v Speaker 4>but it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no way you can't call what</v>

2331
01:34:40.961 --> 01:34:42.910
<v Speaker 4>happened in Orlando,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a mental health problem.</v>

2332
01:34:43.570 --> 01:34:46.540
<v Speaker 4>There's plenty of guns.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are more guns than there are human</v>

2333
01:34:46.541 --> 01:34:49.570
<v Speaker 4>beings in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if there was a gun problem,</v>

2334
01:34:49.571 --> 01:34:52.930
<v Speaker 4>the way a lot of people like to pretend</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a gun problem or the way they</v>

2335
01:34:52.931 --> 01:34:54.460
<v Speaker 4>like to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I shouldn't say pretend because</v>

2336
01:34:54.461 --> 01:34:56.000
<v Speaker 4>obviously there's an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2337
01:34:56.020 --> 01:34:57.650
<v Speaker 4>the way they like to categorize it.</v>

2338
01:34:58.010 --> 01:35:01.010
<v Speaker 1>There would be people shooting people in</v>
<v Speaker 1>mass all day long.</v>

2339
01:35:01.030 --> 01:35:02.750
<v Speaker 1>Every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be impossible to go out of the</v>

2340
01:35:02.751 --> 01:35:05.330
<v Speaker 1>house without looking for gunfire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not the case.</v>

2341
01:35:05.500 --> 01:35:09.580
<v Speaker 1>Will you think about how many people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are and how many guns there are in</v>

2342
01:35:09.581 --> 01:35:14.240
<v Speaker 1>how statistically rare it is that these</v>
<v Speaker 1>things happen.</v>

2343
01:35:14.440 --> 01:35:15.470
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it shows you,</v>

2344
01:35:15.590 --> 01:35:20.300
<v Speaker 1>and then you factor in how many of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are on anti depressants,</v>

2345
01:35:20.450 --> 01:35:23.240
<v Speaker 1>how many of these people are being</v>
<v Speaker 1>weened off of antidepressants?</v>

2346
01:35:23.390 --> 01:35:27.170
<v Speaker 1>Those numbers are terrified because when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at the correlation and the</v>

2347
01:35:27.470 --> 01:35:31.160
<v Speaker 1>correlation does not equal causation is</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a weird argument,</v>

2348
01:35:31.430 --> 01:35:36.430
<v Speaker 1>but it's an undeniable factor that has</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be at least debated and discussed.</v>

2349
01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:42.160
<v Speaker 1>There are so many fucking people in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>country on disassociating meds on things</v>

2350
01:35:43.341 --> 01:35:48.341
<v Speaker 1>that allow you to get away with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could justify and do and act in</v>

2351
01:35:48.951 --> 01:35:53.030
<v Speaker 1>horrific ways and not exactly know what</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fuck you're doing.</v>

2352
01:35:53.180 --> 01:35:58.180
<v Speaker 1>That is one of the problems that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with certain antidepressants</v>

2353
01:35:58.580 --> 01:36:01.310
<v Speaker 1>and too dumb to not connect those two is</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy and to not,</v>

2354
01:36:01.640 --> 01:36:04.280
<v Speaker 1>and even if they're not medicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forget about the medication because the</v>

2355
01:36:04.281 --> 01:36:08.450
<v Speaker 1>medication is one issue with the type of</v>
<v Speaker 1>person that can go into a fucking school</v>

2356
01:36:08.451 --> 01:36:11.150
<v Speaker 1>and shoot a bunch of kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't think that's a mental</v>

2357
01:36:11.151 --> 01:36:12.350
<v Speaker 1>illness issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2358
01:36:12.351 --> 01:36:14.890
<v Speaker 1>it's only a gun issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking crazy.</v>

2359
01:36:14.980 --> 01:36:17.450
<v Speaker 1>It's not a gun issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like calling nine slash 11 a</v>

2360
01:36:17.451 --> 01:36:18.560
<v Speaker 1>plane issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2361
01:36:18.620 --> 01:36:20.240
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a gun issue.</v>

2362
01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:25.190
<v Speaker 1>The gun factor is real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a problem if psycho people and</v>

2363
01:36:25.191 --> 01:36:27.890
<v Speaker 1>people with criminal records are people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are mentally disturbed,</v>

2364
01:36:27.891 --> 01:36:29.000
<v Speaker 1>combined guns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

2365
01:36:29.001 --> 01:36:29.840
<v Speaker 1>That's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2366
01:36:29.841 --> 01:36:32.720
<v Speaker 1>what else is the problem?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that I can get a fucking,</v>

2367
01:36:33.230 --> 01:36:35.420
<v Speaker 1>I can get a gun and I don't even know</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to use it.</v>

2368
01:36:35.750 --> 01:36:36.860
<v Speaker 1>That's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

2369
01:36:36.980 --> 01:36:38.780
<v Speaker 1>You have to have a license to drive a</v>
<v Speaker 1>car.</v>

2370
01:36:38.940 --> 01:36:41.660
<v Speaker 1>If someone has to sit with you that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to take these turns,</v>

2371
01:36:41.770 --> 01:36:44.810
<v Speaker 1>you have to turn right here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to fully stop at the stop sign.</v>

2372
01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:46.460
<v Speaker 1>You have to do all these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't do it,</v>

2373
01:36:46.461 --> 01:36:48.110
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't get your driver's license.</v>

2374
01:36:48.650 --> 01:36:50.270
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to do is not be a criminal and</v>

2375
01:36:50.271 --> 01:36:51.104
<v Speaker 1>you'd get a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2376
01:36:51.110 --> 01:36:52.310
<v Speaker 1>That is fucking crazy.</v>

2377
01:36:52.500 --> 01:36:54.440
<v Speaker 3>And at any age two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's relevant.</v>

2378
01:36:54.520 --> 01:36:56.240
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my nephew is eight years old.</v>

2379
01:36:56.290 --> 01:37:00.740
<v Speaker 3>When he got last Christmas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he got a gun and we live in the country.</v>

2380
01:37:00.741 --> 01:37:02.720
<v Speaker 3>That's normal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kids have guns by the time they're eight</v>

2381
01:37:02.721 --> 01:37:03.880
<v Speaker 3>years old at three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>four years old.</v>

2382
01:37:03.881 --> 01:37:05.660
<v Speaker 3>They're starting with bb guns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They advanced to appellate.</v>

2383
01:37:05.670 --> 01:37:07.700
<v Speaker 3>You've got a shotgun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some parts of the world go,</v>

2384
01:37:07.710 --> 01:37:08.481
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's insane.</v>

2385
01:37:08.481 --> 01:37:09.380
<v Speaker 3>You gave a kid a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2386
01:37:09.381 --> 01:37:10.490
<v Speaker 3>where we live out in the car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2387
01:37:10.491 --> 01:37:12.440
<v Speaker 3>The kid has the gun at the other side of</v>
<v Speaker 3>it though,</v>

2388
01:37:12.680 --> 01:37:15.110
<v Speaker 3>there is no crimes where I come from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>done with a gun,</v>

2389
01:37:15.111 --> 01:37:17.630
<v Speaker 3>whether a guy's doing a simple robbery</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't mean to dismiss that,</v>

2390
01:37:17.631 --> 01:37:21.620
<v Speaker 3>but in the in the eyes of murder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is never and one of the reasons that</v>

2391
01:37:21.621 --> 01:37:25.100
<v Speaker 3>we maintain is when you have guns and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you grow up with guns,</v>

2392
01:37:25.220 --> 01:37:28.100
<v Speaker 3>you learn the dangers of guns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You never play with those things.</v>

2393
01:37:28.101 --> 01:37:31.460
<v Speaker 3>You never point those things at anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you're out shooting watermelons and</v>

2394
01:37:31.461 --> 01:37:34.100
<v Speaker 3>pop cans or whatever it may be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You learn real fast.</v>

2395
01:37:34.580 --> 01:37:38.450
<v Speaker 3>This is why I don't pull a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is why I don't do this because we</v>

2396
01:37:38.451 --> 01:37:40.130
<v Speaker 3>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't know anything about the things</v>

2397
01:37:40.131 --> 01:37:42.950
<v Speaker 3>like the cities in New York and all</v>
<v Speaker 3>these people that are trying to take the</v>

2398
01:37:42.951 --> 01:37:44.540
<v Speaker 3>guns away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't know anything about that out in</v>

2399
01:37:44.541 --> 01:37:45.620
<v Speaker 3>the country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never.</v>

2400
01:37:45.621 --> 01:37:48.530
<v Speaker 3>We don't have any gun problems and</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody's got them.</v>

2401
01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:51.220
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't you also think that living in a</v>

2402
01:37:51.221 --> 01:37:54.580
<v Speaker 1>place like the country where everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>does have guns,</v>

2403
01:37:54.730 --> 01:37:57.300
<v Speaker 1>that is very different environment than</v>
<v Speaker 1>living in a city.</v>

2404
01:37:57.780 --> 01:38:02.370
<v Speaker 1>If everybody had guns in the city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have so much more tension going on.</v>

2405
01:38:02.371 --> 01:38:03.870
<v Speaker 1>It's so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so much different.</v>

2406
01:38:03.950 --> 01:38:06.030
<v Speaker 1>Like the environment's different like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2407
01:38:06.031 --> 01:38:09.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't necessarily think it would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>great if New York City had as many guns</v>

2408
01:38:09.481 --> 01:38:11.400
<v Speaker 1>per capita as Oregon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure,</v>

2409
01:38:11.790 --> 01:38:14.130
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In your original point on this is the</v>

2410
01:38:14.131 --> 01:38:18.330
<v Speaker 1>only thing that stops you from getting a</v>
<v Speaker 1>gun is having a felony is like,</v>

2411
01:38:18.331 --> 01:38:20.940
<v Speaker 1>well that makes sense and nobody's</v>
<v Speaker 1>disputing that,</v>

2412
01:38:20.941 --> 01:38:22.790
<v Speaker 1>but there's got to be a few more things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To your point,</v>

2413
01:38:23.010 --> 01:38:25.160
<v Speaker 1>we need to find out if you're medicaid</v>
<v Speaker 1>as simple drug tests.</v>

2414
01:38:25.161 --> 01:38:26.430
<v Speaker 1>This is pretty quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2415
01:38:26.431 --> 01:38:29.640
<v Speaker 1>the NRA is real big that a guy gets a</v>
<v Speaker 1>gun today because he might need to say,</v>

2416
01:38:29.650 --> 01:38:31.440
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy's got to plan ahead.</v>

2417
01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:32.880
<v Speaker 1>It's just like a driver's license.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

2418
01:38:33.060 --> 01:38:35.160
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the 16 year old has a date on</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saturday,</v>

2419
01:38:35.161 --> 01:38:37.920
<v Speaker 1>but if he doesn't have the license and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to have to postpone the date</v>

2420
01:38:38.070 --> 01:38:40.590
<v Speaker 1>because there needs to be more things</v>
<v Speaker 1>than just simply going,</v>

2421
01:38:40.900 --> 01:38:41.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let,</v>

2422
01:38:41.300 --> 01:38:44.250
<v Speaker 1>let me run your fingerprints and if</v>
<v Speaker 1>something comes back to your point,</v>

2423
01:38:44.251 --> 01:38:46.330
<v Speaker 1>are you on drugs and medication?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about a train of thought?</v>

2424
01:38:46.331 --> 01:38:47.880
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard anybody make that</v>
<v Speaker 1>argument before,</v>

2425
01:38:47.881 --> 01:38:50.970
<v Speaker 1>but I love that analogy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to get a license for a car.</v>

2426
01:38:51.060 --> 01:38:52.920
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty simple process but you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do it.</v>

2427
01:38:52.921 --> 01:38:55.560
<v Speaker 1>Why you shifted it with a gun too</v>
<v Speaker 1>because people need to know why you</v>

2428
01:38:55.561 --> 01:38:59.760
<v Speaker 1>don't use guns 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you have to get a hunter safety,</v>

2429
01:38:59.830 --> 01:39:04.680
<v Speaker 1>a certificate if you want to hunt and if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to use the gun and you know</v>

2430
01:39:04.710 --> 01:39:07.740
<v Speaker 1>it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very detailed in most states.</v>

2431
01:39:07.740 --> 01:39:09.600
<v Speaker 1>You have to have one in many states at</v>
<v Speaker 1>least.</v>

2432
01:39:09.601 --> 01:39:11.100
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even think you have to have in</v>

2433
01:39:11.101 --> 01:39:12.780
<v Speaker 1>California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>

2434
01:39:12.930 --> 01:39:15.780
<v Speaker 1>which is weird because California is</v>
<v Speaker 1>like one of the most restrictive states</v>

2435
01:39:15.781 --> 01:39:17.710
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to firearms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>

2436
01:39:17.711 --> 01:39:20.730
<v Speaker 1>you have to go through this long</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult course and you have to pass</v>

2437
01:39:20.731 --> 01:39:24.030
<v Speaker 1>tests and you have to actually know what</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fuck you're doing and if you don't</v>

2438
01:39:24.031 --> 01:39:26.640
<v Speaker 1>you don't get your hunter safety</v>
<v Speaker 1>certificate and then you can't.</v>

2439
01:39:26.700 --> 01:39:28.140
<v Speaker 1>You can't hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't get a license,</v>

2440
01:39:28.141 --> 01:39:28.381
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2441
01:39:28.381 --> 01:39:33.381
<v Speaker 1>You can't get a license and I think that</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the NRA does is they take a hard</v>

2442
01:39:34.050 --> 01:39:38.370
<v Speaker 1>stance on the side of promoting guns and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't move.</v>

2443
01:39:38.490 --> 01:39:42.570
<v Speaker 1>Not only do they not budge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they almost are unreasonable in their</v>

2444
01:39:42.571 --> 01:39:46.590
<v Speaker 1>position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I feel like that is because the left</v>

2445
01:39:46.830 --> 01:39:50.070
<v Speaker 1>is so unreasonable when anything goes</v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

2446
01:39:50.250 --> 01:39:54.270
<v Speaker 1>they immediately want to ban guns and</v>
<v Speaker 1>take guns away that it's not.</v>

2447
01:39:54.600 --> 01:39:57.450
<v Speaker 1>It's not feasible at this day and people</v>
<v Speaker 1>are like,</v>

2448
01:39:57.460 --> 01:39:58.231
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to do that.</v>

2449
01:39:58.231 --> 01:40:00.300
<v Speaker 1>Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia is 20 million people.</v>

2450
01:40:00.301 --> 01:40:02.010
<v Speaker 1>It's the size of the continental United</v>
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>

2451
01:40:02.460 --> 01:40:05.730
<v Speaker 1>To Equate Australia with the United</v>
<v Speaker 1>States is insane.</v>

2452
01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:08.970
<v Speaker 1>There's just way too many people here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a completely different and by the</v>

2453
01:40:08.971 --> 01:40:10.410
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't ban guns in Australia.</v>

2454
01:40:10.411 --> 01:40:12.150
<v Speaker 1>People hunt with guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get guns,</v>

2455
01:40:12.151 --> 01:40:13.380
<v Speaker 1>you can register guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get them.</v>

2456
01:40:13.620 --> 01:40:16.290
<v Speaker 1>You'd go to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd be belong part of hunting clubs</v>

2457
01:40:16.291 --> 01:40:18.390
<v Speaker 1>like they do in Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You keep them stored in lockers.</v>

2458
01:40:19.770 --> 01:40:22.590
<v Speaker 1>It's not a full on band.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On firearms is just much more</v>

2459
01:40:22.591 --> 01:40:25.830
<v Speaker 1>restrictive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The NRA is trying to stop restrictions</v>

2460
01:40:25.860 --> 01:40:28.810
<v Speaker 1>and the reason why they're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop restrictions because you know when</v>

2461
01:40:29.010 --> 01:40:33.690
<v Speaker 1>anything goes on television,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very disingenuous for someone to go</v>

2462
01:40:33.691 --> 01:40:37.830
<v Speaker 1>on television after some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>massacre and not bring up all the</v>

2463
01:40:37.831 --> 01:40:40.680
<v Speaker 1>factors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not bring up psych meds,</v>

2464
01:40:40.710 --> 01:40:44.070
<v Speaker 1>not bring up mental health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not talk about the correlation between</v>

2465
01:40:44.490 --> 01:40:49.490
<v Speaker 1>raising kids in abusive households and</v>
<v Speaker 1>having children grow up with this,</v>

2466
01:40:49.830 --> 01:40:52.710
<v Speaker 1>these horrible lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they go on and become fucking</v>

2467
01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:53.410
<v Speaker 1>psychopaths.</v>

2468
01:40:53.410 --> 01:40:55.030
<v Speaker 1>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a correlation there.</v>

2469
01:40:56.740 --> 01:40:59.440
<v Speaker 1>It's not simply whether or not the kid</v>
<v Speaker 1>had the tool to do the job.</v>

2470
01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:01.330
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why the fuck did they want to do that in</v>

2471
01:41:01.331 --> 01:41:04.030
<v Speaker 1>the first place?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you find out so many of these</v>

2472
01:41:04.031 --> 01:41:05.710
<v Speaker 1>cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this guy in Orlando,</v>

2473
01:41:05.770 --> 01:41:08.680
<v Speaker 1>the FBI had them on a watch list just a</v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of years ago twice.</v>

2474
01:41:08.740 --> 01:41:09.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2475
01:41:09.310 --> 01:41:10.240
<v Speaker 1>come on man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2476
01:41:10.270 --> 01:41:12.910
<v Speaker 1>that fucking kid in Colorado that killed</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody at the movie theater.</v>

2477
01:41:13.030 --> 01:41:14.950
<v Speaker 1>They knew that guy was out of his</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking mind.</v>

2478
01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:18.730
<v Speaker 1>He had talked about killing a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and there's a lot of those cases</v>

2479
01:41:18.731 --> 01:41:22.450
<v Speaker 1>where they get ignored and that's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>giant issue and I don't know how to</v>

2480
01:41:22.451 --> 01:41:26.560
<v Speaker 1>solve that issue because what do you do</v>
<v Speaker 1>when someone comes along and says,</v>

2481
01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:28.660
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking about going into a movie</v>

2482
01:41:28.661 --> 01:41:30.640
<v Speaker 1>theater and killing a bunch of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just kidding.</v>

2483
01:41:30.670 --> 01:41:31.503
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what do you,</v>

2484
01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:32.090
<v Speaker 1>what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do?</v>

2485
01:41:32.090 --> 01:41:34.810
<v Speaker 1>You know how I'm going to go buy your</v>
<v Speaker 1>first statement and lock you up forever?</v>

2486
01:41:35.020 --> 01:41:36.010
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2487
01:41:36.011 --> 01:41:37.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to do there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

2488
01:41:37.610 --> 01:41:42.070
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a gigantic argument when</v>
<v Speaker 1>it comes to gun violence in this</v>

2489
01:41:42.071 --> 01:41:44.260
<v Speaker 1>contract,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a gigantic argument when it</v>

2490
01:41:44.261 --> 01:41:46.840
<v Speaker 1>comes to mental illness and we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>pushing that one aside.</v>

2491
01:41:46.890 --> 01:41:48.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think they just do it at the wrong</v>

2492
01:41:48.601 --> 01:41:48.991
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2493
01:41:48.991 --> 01:41:51.210
<v Speaker 3>they get emotions involved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jfk made a statement,</v>

2494
01:41:51.510 --> 01:41:52.500
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>back when he was president,</v>

2495
01:41:52.501 --> 01:41:56.220
<v Speaker 3>never let a good crisis go to waste.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it is believed by politicians.</v>

2496
01:41:56.221 --> 01:41:58.230
<v Speaker 3>When you have a crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's when you go on the attack.</v>

2497
01:41:58.231 --> 01:41:59.820
<v Speaker 3>But that's when the emotions are the</v>
<v Speaker 3>highest.</v>

2498
01:41:59.821 --> 01:42:02.670
<v Speaker 3>I disagree with this statement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a good time to get your agenda out</v>

2499
01:42:02.671 --> 01:42:04.950
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're just pissing people off and</v>

2500
01:42:04.951 --> 01:42:06.310
<v Speaker 3>you're entrenched in them in their own</v>
<v Speaker 3>views.</v>

2501
01:42:06.330 --> 01:42:08.190
<v Speaker 3>A great time to bring up the gun</v>
<v Speaker 3>argument.</v>

2502
01:42:08.730 --> 01:42:10.470
<v Speaker 3>I'm pro gun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I do understand.</v>

2503
01:42:10.471 --> 01:42:11.850
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some room to give her.</v>

2504
01:42:11.851 --> 01:42:15.060
<v Speaker 3>I love what you said about a licensed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You relate that to a driving a car.</v>

2505
01:42:15.061 --> 01:42:17.760
<v Speaker 3>It makes perfect sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bring it when emotions are a little bit</v>

2506
01:42:17.761 --> 01:42:18.780
<v Speaker 3>less comfortable and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2507
01:42:18.781 --> 01:42:20.790
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's make sure we do this.</v>

2508
01:42:20.790 --> 01:42:23.790
<v Speaker 3>And if you're worried about your safety,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of get a little bit proactive here.</v>

2509
01:42:23.791 --> 01:42:26.280
<v Speaker 3>Start the process that you can have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>gun if that's what you want to do.</v>

2510
01:42:26.550 --> 01:42:28.790
<v Speaker 3>But I don't agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that they're,</v>

2511
01:42:28.791 --> 01:42:29.700
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're wrong.</v>

2512
01:42:29.701 --> 01:42:32.160
<v Speaker 3>Following Jeff K's model that he said in</v>
<v Speaker 3>1964,</v>

2513
01:42:32.161 --> 01:42:35.310
<v Speaker 3>I think here in 2016,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let emotions die down a little bit,</v>

2514
01:42:35.311 --> 01:42:37.440
<v Speaker 3>let not people not be pissed on one side</v>
<v Speaker 3>or the other.</v>

2515
01:42:37.441 --> 01:42:39.960
<v Speaker 3>Worried about protecting themselves and</v>
<v Speaker 3>their family were worried that</v>

2516
01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:41.640
<v Speaker 3>something's going to happen to</v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves with their family.</v>

2517
01:42:41.650 --> 01:42:44.010
<v Speaker 3>You get good people with really</v>
<v Speaker 3>different views here.</v>

2518
01:42:44.520 --> 01:42:48.420
<v Speaker 3>I think that they're misplacing jfk</v>
<v Speaker 3>philosophy in my opinion.</v>

2519
01:42:48.421 --> 01:42:50.730
<v Speaker 3>In 2016,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let things die down a little bit and</v>

2520
01:42:50.731 --> 01:42:51.564
<v Speaker 3>then bring it up.</v>

2521
01:42:51.890 --> 01:42:54.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's also this weird adherence,</v>

2522
01:42:54.410 --> 01:42:59.410
<v Speaker 1>concrete adherence to the bill of rights</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know the second amendment.</v>

2523
01:42:59.930 --> 01:43:01.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2524
01:43:01.520 --> 01:43:04.820
<v Speaker 1>I think that people should look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think if there's only three of</v>

2525
01:43:04.821 --> 01:43:05.870
<v Speaker 1>us in this world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

2526
01:43:05.871 --> 01:43:07.570
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me and Jamie were the only ones.</v>

2527
01:43:07.710 --> 01:43:09.740
<v Speaker 1>If Jamie came along and said nobody</v>
<v Speaker 1>could have guns,</v>

2528
01:43:09.980 --> 01:43:11.900
<v Speaker 1>I think we would get together and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck that guy.</v>

2529
01:43:12.140 --> 01:43:14.600
<v Speaker 1>Who's this guy to tell us what we can</v>
<v Speaker 1>and can't do.</v>

2530
01:43:14.870 --> 01:43:18.590
<v Speaker 1>That same thought process could be</v>
<v Speaker 1>applied to 300 million people.</v>

2531
01:43:19.100 --> 01:43:22.670
<v Speaker 1>It just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree that a grown human being</v>

2532
01:43:22.760 --> 01:43:26.060
<v Speaker 1>should be able to tell another grown</v>
<v Speaker 1>human being what they can and can't do</v>

2533
01:43:26.240 --> 01:43:28.940
<v Speaker 1>as long as it's not like if you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey joe,</v>

2534
01:43:28.941 --> 01:43:32.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking about starting a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>nuclear power plant in your backyard and</v>

2535
01:43:32.391 --> 01:43:34.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure it know what I'm doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if we're going to have to move to</v>

2536
01:43:34.881 --> 01:43:35.900
<v Speaker 1>the middle of the ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

2537
01:43:36.020 --> 01:43:40.640
<v Speaker 1>well then we got a problem and you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of apply that logic to guns.</v>

2538
01:43:40.650 --> 01:43:41.451
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2539
01:43:41.451 --> 01:43:42.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

2540
01:43:42.110 --> 01:43:45.170
<v Speaker 1>if you're a fucking gun nut and you'd</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to shoot guns off in your backyard</v>

2541
01:43:45.171 --> 01:43:47.600
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might ricochet one and fucking shoot</v>

2542
01:43:47.601 --> 01:43:51.210
<v Speaker 1>my dog or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it becomes a safety issue and a</v>

2543
01:43:51.470 --> 01:43:56.470
<v Speaker 1>health issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's hard to justify using the words</v>

2544
01:43:57.621 --> 01:44:02.621
<v Speaker 1>of people that lived in the fucking 17</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds when it comes to today with the</v>

2545
01:44:03.561 --> 01:44:07.190
<v Speaker 1>kind of guns that we have with the kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of society that we have with the kind of</v>

2546
01:44:07.370 --> 01:44:08.350
<v Speaker 1>just our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>

2547
01:44:08.430 --> 01:44:10.820
<v Speaker 1>our across the board,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our legal system,</v>

2548
01:44:11.050 --> 01:44:11.740
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>

2549
01:44:11.740 --> 01:44:13.400
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our system of government,</v>

2550
01:44:13.430 --> 01:44:14.750
<v Speaker 1>representative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>

2551
01:44:14.930 --> 01:44:19.160
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff is fucking bananas in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world of 2016.</v>

2552
01:44:19.370 --> 01:44:22.880
<v Speaker 1>Representative government has no place</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a world where everyone has social</v>

2553
01:44:22.881 --> 01:44:26.360
<v Speaker 1>media where everyone can be represented</v>
<v Speaker 1>instantaneously.</v>

2554
01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:30.590
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to get on a fucking horse</v>
<v Speaker 1>and take a parchment across the country</v>

2555
01:44:30.740 --> 01:44:34.880
<v Speaker 1>to hand it to some dude in a powdered</v>
<v Speaker 1>wig that's old that we don't need that</v>

2556
01:44:34.881 --> 01:44:35.480
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

2557
01:44:35.480 --> 01:44:38.090
<v Speaker 1>So when you start talking about things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are in the bill of rights and</v>

2558
01:44:38.091 --> 01:44:41.360
<v Speaker 1>things that are in the constitution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ge think it's time to update that</v>

2559
01:44:41.361 --> 01:44:44.170
<v Speaker 1>fucking ancient piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

2560
01:44:44.200 --> 01:44:46.190
<v Speaker 1>it was great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had amazing insight.</v>

2561
01:44:46.191 --> 01:44:48.860
<v Speaker 1>They were brilliant people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We owe them everything.</v>

2562
01:44:48.980 --> 01:44:52.730
<v Speaker 1>This experiment of self government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States of America was founded</v>

2563
01:44:52.731 --> 01:44:55.400
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a fantastic invention and it's one of</v>

2564
01:44:55.401 --> 01:44:59.720
<v Speaker 1>the reasons why so much art and</v>
<v Speaker 1>creativity and innovation and freedom</v>

2565
01:44:59.870 --> 01:45:04.820
<v Speaker 1>come from this part of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to rely on the exact words written</v>

2566
01:45:04.821 --> 01:45:09.440
<v Speaker 1>with a fucking feather back when people</v>
<v Speaker 1>were taken wooden boats across the</v>

2567
01:45:09.441 --> 01:45:11.540
<v Speaker 1>ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hoping they wouldn't get eaten by</v>

2568
01:45:11.541 --> 01:45:14.540
<v Speaker 1>Indians when they land in here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the native Americans.</v>

2569
01:45:14.600 --> 01:45:15.690
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2570
01:45:15.870 --> 01:45:16.703
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2571
01:45:16.730 --> 01:45:20.340
<v Speaker 1>I just think it's ridiculous to say</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything we're not supposed to know.</v>

2572
01:45:20.420 --> 01:45:23.150
<v Speaker 1>So it was right up there with retard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And could you say homo?</v>

2573
01:45:23.260 --> 01:45:24.340
<v Speaker 1>I think he's still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say Homo.</v>

2574
01:45:24.400 --> 01:45:25.340
<v Speaker 1>Homo sapiens.</v>

2575
01:45:25.540 --> 01:45:29.020
<v Speaker 2>I did not know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Politicians try to be correct all the</v>

2576
01:45:29.021 --> 01:45:31.360
<v Speaker 2>time and say African American.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that term is wrong.</v>

2577
01:45:31.390 --> 01:45:32.500
<v Speaker 2>It's black.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2578
01:45:32.590 --> 01:45:34.300
<v Speaker 2>Not all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not all blacks are Africans.</v>

2579
01:45:34.301 --> 01:45:35.230
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people from Haiti.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2580
01:45:35.231 --> 01:45:39.580
<v Speaker 2>To your point that people have this</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolute fetish for the constitution.</v>

2581
01:45:39.581 --> 01:45:42.490
<v Speaker 2>No matter how many times we've amended</v>
<v Speaker 2>over the years and it extends to the</v>

2582
01:45:42.491 --> 01:45:44.380
<v Speaker 2>bill of a bill of rights to it and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>need to take,</v>

2583
01:45:44.560 --> 01:45:45.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you bring up a feather,</v>

2584
01:45:45.671 --> 01:45:47.200
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's accurate.</v>

2585
01:45:47.201 --> 01:45:49.270
<v Speaker 2>They sign it with a feather,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they were also married to their</v>

2586
01:45:49.271 --> 01:45:51.460
<v Speaker 2>cousin and they bathed once a week and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had slaves.</v>

2587
01:45:51.520 --> 01:45:52.990
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

2588
01:45:52.991 --> 01:45:54.700
<v Speaker 2>hey guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things changed.</v>

2589
01:45:54.701 --> 01:45:56.950
<v Speaker 2>So these guys did their level best at</v>
<v Speaker 2>that time,</v>

2590
01:45:56.951 --> 01:45:59.520
<v Speaker 2>but they couldn't see the world and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2591
01:45:59.590 --> 01:46:02.080
<v Speaker 2>in perpetuity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then assign it is no matter how many</v>

2592
01:46:02.081 --> 01:46:05.110
<v Speaker 2>times we've amended the constitution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys still have a fetish that this</v>

2593
01:46:05.111 --> 01:46:08.530
<v Speaker 2>was like the Gospel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This wasn't touched by the hand of God.</v>

2594
01:46:08.531 --> 01:46:10.930
<v Speaker 2>This was written by knuckleheads with</v>
<v Speaker 2>eighth grade educations.</v>

2595
01:46:11.140 --> 01:46:11.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And just do what?</v>

2596
01:46:12.070 --> 01:46:14.890
<v Speaker 1>And the thing about the bill of rights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason why they cling to that second</v>

2597
01:46:14.891 --> 01:46:19.000
<v Speaker 1>amendment is because it does state that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have the right to bear arms.</v>

2598
01:46:19.180 --> 01:46:21.340
<v Speaker 1>So they got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's written down.</v>

2599
01:46:21.430 --> 01:46:22.100
<v Speaker 1>It's all right.</v>

2600
01:46:22.100 --> 01:46:25.220
<v Speaker 2>Sure we got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people also love the basis behind</v>

2601
01:46:25.221 --> 01:46:26.960
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't about hunter and gatherer like</v>

2602
01:46:26.961 --> 01:46:28.070
<v Speaker 2>some people say it was about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2603
01:46:28.220 --> 01:46:32.540
<v Speaker 2>if our government has guns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we have guns so that we can always</v>

2604
01:46:32.541 --> 01:46:35.840
<v Speaker 2>overtake our government should we need</v>
<v Speaker 2>to now in the world of tanks and</v>

2605
01:46:35.930 --> 01:46:37.580
<v Speaker 2>aircraft and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course that doesn't.</v>

2606
01:46:37.610 --> 01:46:39.860
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't hold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's the part that people like.</v>

2607
01:46:39.861 --> 01:46:42.320
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to give their government</v>
<v Speaker 2>the power of the people don't have.</v>

2608
01:46:42.560 --> 01:46:44.590
<v Speaker 2>That is a wonderful philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's.</v>

2609
01:46:44.650 --> 01:46:46.660
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of outgrown itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has</v>

2610
01:46:46.880 --> 01:46:49.770
<v Speaker 1>ron itself in the United States of</v>
<v Speaker 1>America in 2016,</v>

2611
01:46:49.771 --> 01:46:52.650
<v Speaker 1>but if the shit hits the fan and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely could.</v>

2612
01:46:52.830 --> 01:46:57.830
<v Speaker 1>We are one natural disaster away from</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos at all times and that is something</v>

2613
01:46:58.051 --> 01:47:00.090
<v Speaker 1>that has happened all throughout human</v>
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>

2614
01:47:00.230 --> 01:47:04.140
<v Speaker 1>There have been gigantic asteroidal</v>
<v Speaker 1>impacts.</v>

2615
01:47:04.141 --> 01:47:07.830
<v Speaker 1>There have been super volcanoes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There have been tidal waves.</v>

2616
01:47:07.831 --> 01:47:09.930
<v Speaker 1>There's been a lot of shit that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then all of a sudden,</v>

2617
01:47:09.931 --> 01:47:12.300
<v Speaker 1>chaos mean we saw what happened with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Katrina.</v>

2618
01:47:12.540 --> 01:47:17.540
<v Speaker 1>Katrina hit and there was looting and</v>
<v Speaker 1>rioting and chaos and people have the</v>

2619
01:47:17.641 --> 01:47:21.810
<v Speaker 1>right to defend themselves and protect</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves in that kind of situation.</v>

2620
01:47:21.811 --> 01:47:25.950
<v Speaker 1>When people go crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you factor in the possibility of</v>

2621
01:47:25.951 --> 01:47:29.370
<v Speaker 1>government going crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is just as much of a possibility.</v>

2622
01:47:29.371 --> 01:47:32.790
<v Speaker 1>It's happened all throughout history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's happening in Russia right now.</v>

2623
01:47:32.820 --> 01:47:36.090
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia is being run by fucking gangsters</v>

2624
01:47:36.210 --> 01:47:38.010
<v Speaker 1>and not the sun and Kai.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

2625
01:47:38.140 --> 01:47:39.220
<v Speaker 1>A different kind of gangs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2626
01:47:39.260 --> 01:47:40.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Putin is a murderer.</v>

2627
01:47:40.710 --> 01:47:42.570
<v Speaker 1>He's a tyrant for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent.</v>

2628
01:47:42.600 --> 01:47:43.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2629
01:47:43.711 --> 01:47:46.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm not an effective leader for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for all the wrong word,</v>

2630
01:47:46.971 --> 01:47:48.030
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he is effective.</v>

2631
01:47:48.570 --> 01:47:49.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2632
01:47:49.370 --> 01:47:50.131
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

2633
01:47:50.131 --> 01:47:53.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there is an argument that when</v>

2634
01:47:53.911 --> 01:47:58.050
<v Speaker 1>people have ultimate power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they also have massive potential for</v>

2635
01:47:58.051 --> 01:48:00.660
<v Speaker 1>corruption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see that today with the Clinton</v>

2636
01:48:01.230 --> 01:48:02.130
<v Speaker 1>campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2637
01:48:02.131 --> 01:48:04.650
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this nonsense with the fucking emails</v>

2638
01:48:04.651 --> 01:48:09.651
<v Speaker 1>and they'll classify data that she had</v>
<v Speaker 1>inadvertently or purposely sent through</v>

2639
01:48:10.921 --> 01:48:15.360
<v Speaker 1>email and then the difference between</v>
<v Speaker 1>her take on it and what the FBI's take</v>

2640
01:48:15.361 --> 01:48:17.820
<v Speaker 1>on it was like this clearly lying going</v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

2641
01:48:17.850 --> 01:48:21.540
<v Speaker 1>There's clearly corruption going on</v>
<v Speaker 1>because clearly people protecting her</v>

2642
01:48:21.930 --> 01:48:26.220
<v Speaker 1>and that kind of corruption where it</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't apply to you and it wouldn't</v>

2643
01:48:26.221 --> 01:48:27.540
<v Speaker 1>apply to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We would go to jail.</v>

2644
01:48:27.590 --> 01:48:28.350
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we,</v>

2645
01:48:28.350 --> 01:48:33.350
<v Speaker 1>if we sent those same emails,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we were involved in the transfer of</v>

2646
01:48:33.481 --> 01:48:38.481
<v Speaker 1>top secret information through erroneous</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking pathways or however the fuck she</v>

2647
01:48:41.071 --> 01:48:41.860
<v Speaker 1>did it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not,</v>

2648
01:48:41.860 --> 01:48:44.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't exactly know the specifics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if we did any of those things,</v>

2649
01:48:44.850 --> 01:48:49.800
<v Speaker 1>we would most likely be convicted and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>would most likely at least get find a</v>

2650
01:48:49.801 --> 01:48:51.560
<v Speaker 1>massive amount of money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more likely.</v>

2651
01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:52.720
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Martha,</v>

2652
01:48:52.720 --> 01:48:55.250
<v Speaker 2>Martha Stewart went to jail just for</v>
<v Speaker 2>lying to the FBI.</v>

2653
01:48:55.251 --> 01:48:56.830
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now is in that same jam.</v>

2654
01:48:56.831 --> 01:48:59.830
<v Speaker 2>The FBI saying they didn't look into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That whole thing is very for gazy.</v>

2655
01:49:00.010 --> 01:49:00.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2656
01:49:00.280 --> 01:49:03.370
<v Speaker 2>that whole thing is very corrupt and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think that call me at the FBI's a</v>

2657
01:49:03.371 --> 01:49:06.250
<v Speaker 2>reasonable guy or are however,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tend to believe him,</v>

2658
01:49:06.251 --> 01:49:09.070
<v Speaker 2>but that was never a fair shake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obama stays out of the whole thing.</v>

2659
01:49:09.071 --> 01:49:13.990
<v Speaker 2>Then he finally comes in a law lynch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Loretta Lynch finally comes in and says,</v>

2660
01:49:13.991 --> 01:49:15.280
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to honor whatever the FBI</v>

2661
01:49:15.281 --> 01:49:17.350
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then four days later the FBI drops</v>

2662
01:49:17.351 --> 01:49:17.981
<v Speaker 2>the news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2663
01:49:17.981 --> 01:49:18.491
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is.</v>

2664
01:49:18.491 --> 01:49:19.840
<v Speaker 2>Forget this has been going on for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>

2665
01:49:20.030 --> 01:49:21.610
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you something else you know</v>

2666
01:49:21.611 --> 01:49:23.860
<v Speaker 2>who looks weak in the whole thing is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>FBI.</v>

2667
01:49:24.040 --> 01:49:27.400
<v Speaker 2>These guys are supposed to be great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We put 40 people on the Hillary Clinton</v>

2668
01:49:27.401 --> 01:49:29.380
<v Speaker 2>place to put that in perspective for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>listeners,</v>

2669
01:49:29.590 --> 01:49:34.590
<v Speaker 2>for people were assigned to Al Capone 10</v>
<v Speaker 2>times the amount and it took them one</v>

2670
01:49:34.781 --> 01:49:37.630
<v Speaker 2>year of having the evidence to make a</v>
<v Speaker 2>ruling.</v>

2671
01:49:37.631 --> 01:49:38.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on,</v>

2672
01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:40.390
<v Speaker 2>that's weak and the same thing's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>on with Isis.</v>

2673
01:49:40.600 --> 01:49:43.810
<v Speaker 2>We're supposed to have this great</v>
<v Speaker 2>military and no offense to the people</v>

2674
01:49:43.811 --> 01:49:45.190
<v Speaker 2>that serve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but offense to the people that are</v>

2675
01:49:45.200 --> 01:49:47.460
<v Speaker 2>handcuffing our.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our military isis,</v>

2676
01:49:47.470 --> 01:49:48.040
<v Speaker 2>when I first</v>

2677
01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:52.510
<v Speaker 3>had heard about them for the very first</v>
<v Speaker 3>time was 200 members strong.</v>

2678
01:49:52.810 --> 01:49:57.130
<v Speaker 3>Now they are 4,000 strong and weak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Still can't stop these guys and we're</v>

2679
01:49:57.131 --> 01:49:58.210
<v Speaker 3>supposed to be the best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look.</v>

2680
01:49:58.330 --> 01:50:00.100
<v Speaker 3>Of course we could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just don't,</v>

2681
01:50:00.101 --> 01:50:03.490
<v Speaker 3>but it makes us look weak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would not happen in Russia.</v>

2682
01:50:03.640 --> 01:50:06.400
<v Speaker 3>Nobody attacks the Russians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you attack poot and you will be</v>

2683
01:50:06.401 --> 01:50:08.470
<v Speaker 3>fighting Putin right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no permission,</v>

2684
01:50:08.471 --> 01:50:09.940
<v Speaker 3>no congress,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no bs.</v>

2685
01:50:10.120 --> 01:50:11.920
<v Speaker 3>You want to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to go with Russia,</v>

2686
01:50:11.921 --> 01:50:12.770
<v Speaker 3>and that's why nobody</v>

2687
01:50:12.820 --> 01:50:14.200
<v Speaker 1>does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're right.</v>

2688
01:50:14.710 --> 01:50:18.580
<v Speaker 1>I think you're definitely right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when there's direct evidence of</v>

2689
01:50:19.590 --> 01:50:22.060
<v Speaker 1>Clinton's statements versus the FBI</v>
<v Speaker 1>statements,</v>

2690
01:50:22.390 --> 01:50:24.160
<v Speaker 1>Clinton saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I only used one device.</v>

2691
01:50:24.161 --> 01:50:29.161
<v Speaker 1>FBI saying choose multiple devices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No Clinton saying that no classified or</v>

2692
01:50:29.861 --> 01:50:31.960
<v Speaker 1>top secret documents were shared or</v>
<v Speaker 1>leaked.</v>

2693
01:50:32.410 --> 01:50:34.180
<v Speaker 1>FBI saying hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds,</v>

2694
01:50:34.210 --> 01:50:35.670
<v Speaker 1>hundreds and deleted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2695
01:50:35.860 --> 01:50:37.540
<v Speaker 1>it's all fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all fucked,</v>

2696
01:50:37.630 --> 01:50:39.970
<v Speaker 1>but that's corruption and that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinks,</v>

2697
01:50:40.030 --> 01:50:42.760
<v Speaker 1>and this is not the kind of corruption</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we need to be absolutely terrified</v>

2698
01:50:42.761 --> 01:50:46.330
<v Speaker 1>of like they're going to come and steal</v>
<v Speaker 1>our children and take all our money away</v>

2699
01:50:46.331 --> 01:50:48.370
<v Speaker 1>and and fucking shoot anybody who talks</v>
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>

2700
01:50:48.550 --> 01:50:52.750
<v Speaker 1>that's not that level of corruption,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a slippery slope with any</v>

2701
01:50:52.751 --> 01:50:54.730
<v Speaker 1>corruption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the laws don't apply to you because</v>

2702
01:50:54.731 --> 01:50:58.030
<v Speaker 1>your name is Hillary Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the law applies to Chilson under Joe</v>

2703
01:50:58.030 --> 01:50:59.260
<v Speaker 1>Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's nonsense.</v>

2704
01:50:59.350 --> 01:51:01.330
<v Speaker 1>That's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not the world that we want.</v>

2705
01:51:01.730 --> 01:51:06.160
<v Speaker 1>That's the real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When someone is outside of the law or</v>

2706
01:51:06.161 --> 01:51:09.310
<v Speaker 1>the law respects them in a different way</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it respects you,</v>

2707
01:51:09.440 --> 01:51:12.760
<v Speaker 1>that's not good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's why the second amendment</v>

2708
01:51:12.761 --> 01:51:17.110
<v Speaker 1>exists is second amendment exists to</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop fuckery because people are crazy</v>

2709
01:51:17.350 --> 01:51:18.340
<v Speaker 1>and when people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

2710
01:51:18.341 --> 01:51:20.980
<v Speaker 1>it's about muskets and it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

2711
01:51:22.030 --> 01:51:24.550
<v Speaker 1>It's for a militia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's only the guns or no,</v>

2712
01:51:24.940 --> 01:51:25.481
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2713
01:51:25.481 --> 01:51:29.830
<v Speaker 1>It's to prevent this kind of shit from</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting completely out of hand.</v>

2714
01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:35.000
<v Speaker 1>It's prevent the government from taking</v>
<v Speaker 1>over and allow people to form a</v>

2715
01:51:35.111 --> 01:51:36.100
<v Speaker 1>resistance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

2716
01:51:36.160 --> 01:51:36.970
<v Speaker 1>To be honest.</v>

2717
01:51:36.970 --> 01:51:37.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey.</v>

2718
01:51:37.620 --> 01:51:40.250
<v Speaker 3>So many people think that trump's crazy</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's going to lead us into warrants</v>

2719
01:51:40.260 --> 01:51:45.260
<v Speaker 3>like guys sometime read the art of war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just read the art of work is the best</v>

2720
01:51:45.701 --> 01:51:48.780
<v Speaker 3>general never fires a shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ever poot and hasn't had a whip.</v>

<v Speaker 3>A lot of vast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No poodle kill you if he needs to,</v>

2722
01:51:50.651 --> 01:51:53.410
<v Speaker 3>but he hasn't had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He took over a part of the Ukraine,</v>

2723
01:51:53.411 --> 01:51:54.940
<v Speaker 3>didn't kill a person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He rolled in.</v>

2724
01:51:54.941 --> 01:51:57.300
<v Speaker 3>He said he wanted it and now he has a</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of the Ukraine k,</v>

2725
01:51:57.550 --> 01:51:59.710
<v Speaker 3>that's leadership.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He aligned,</v>

2726
01:52:00.460 --> 01:52:01.990
<v Speaker 3>but it's late.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying this is good,</v>

2727
01:52:01.991 --> 01:52:04.310
<v Speaker 3>but that's what a leader does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A leader makes a decision.</v>

2728
01:52:04.330 --> 01:52:06.190
<v Speaker 3>He goes in and takes her and he didn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to kill anybody.</v>

2729
01:52:06.340 --> 01:52:09.490
<v Speaker 3>The best general never fires a shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Donald trump isn't planning to go and</v>

2730
01:52:09.491 --> 01:52:13.210
<v Speaker 3>with people he's planning to make people</v>
<v Speaker 3>think he will whip them,</v>

2731
01:52:13.211 --> 01:52:15.580
<v Speaker 3>which is why he's not going to get us</v>
<v Speaker 3>into wars and people.</v>

2732
01:52:15.670 --> 01:52:19.660
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people don't see that and trump</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't come out and reveal this big</v>

2733
01:52:19.661 --> 01:52:20.351
<v Speaker 3>curtain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or people go,</v>

2734
01:52:20.351 --> 01:52:22.390
<v Speaker 3>oh well the whole thing's a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He can't do that.</v>

2735
01:52:22.391 --> 01:52:25.120
<v Speaker 3>So he's got to stand this ground,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take people saying he's crazy.</v>

2736
01:52:25.121 --> 01:52:26.370
<v Speaker 3>Hope that enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2737
01:52:26.400 --> 01:52:28.270
<v Speaker 3>enough people get it to vote them into</v>
<v Speaker 3>office,</v>

2738
01:52:28.271 --> 01:52:30.640
<v Speaker 3>but that's all he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's going around saying it's our way or</v>

2739
01:52:30.641 --> 01:52:33.520
<v Speaker 3>the highway where the economic power</v>
<v Speaker 3>will the military power.</v>

2740
01:52:33.640 --> 01:52:35.740
<v Speaker 3>We do things right and you're gonna do</v>
<v Speaker 3>it our way and we're not going to do a</v>

2741
01:52:35.741 --> 01:52:37.990
<v Speaker 3>lot of compromising.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you align like that,</v>

2742
01:52:37.991 --> 01:52:40.090
<v Speaker 3>you look at North Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the craziest they do there.</v>

2743
01:52:40.091 --> 01:52:42.250
<v Speaker 3>They scare everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For years we've paid a bunch of money.</v>

2744
01:52:42.251 --> 01:52:45.290
<v Speaker 3>Bill Clinton paid them 8 billion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>George Bush paid them six and a half</v>

2745
01:52:45.291 --> 01:52:45.651
<v Speaker 3>billion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2746
01:52:45.651 --> 01:52:46.010
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter</v>

2747
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:48.050
<v Speaker 2>if you're Democrat or Republican,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're paying these knuckleheads for</v>

2748
01:52:48.051 --> 01:52:49.880
<v Speaker 2>making straight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've never fired a shot.</v>

2749
01:52:50.090 --> 01:52:54.170
<v Speaker 2>They just understand the art of war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Talked to whoever talks stuff is the</v>

2750
01:52:54.171 --> 01:52:57.800
<v Speaker 2>toughest on the playground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody listening to this had a tough</v>

2751
01:52:57.801 --> 01:52:58.421
<v Speaker 2>guy in school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2752
01:52:58.421 --> 01:53:01.010
<v Speaker 2>what was the toughest guy in school?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody listening to this right now</v>

2753
01:53:01.011 --> 01:53:02.930
<v Speaker 2>can go on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take that guy.</v>

2754
01:53:02.960 --> 01:53:05.180
<v Speaker 2>They all know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd ask them a follow up question.</v>

2755
01:53:05.580 --> 01:53:08.060
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever see him getting a fight?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And all of them are going,</v>

2756
01:53:08.300 --> 01:53:08.970
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2757
01:53:08.970 --> 01:53:10.640
<v Speaker 2>Who'd fight him?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was the toughest guy in school.</v>

2758
01:53:10.730 --> 01:53:13.130
<v Speaker 2>Whoever talks the toughest is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>toughest,</v>

2759
01:53:13.131 --> 01:53:15.950
<v Speaker 2>and those rules don't change from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>playground to the octagon,</v>

2760
01:53:16.040 --> 01:53:18.320
<v Speaker 2>to the White House.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't change the best.</v>

2761
01:53:18.321 --> 01:53:20.060
<v Speaker 2>General never fires a shot.</v>

2762
01:53:21.380 --> 01:53:23.330
<v Speaker 1>When I was in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the toughest kid beat the fuck out of</v>

2763
01:53:23.331 --> 01:53:25.230
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My name is frank piece.</v>

2764
01:53:25.280 --> 01:53:28.040
<v Speaker 1>He was fucking huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's most likely on steroids.</v>

2765
01:53:28.370 --> 01:53:31.570
<v Speaker 1>He was a gigantic fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was so terrified.</v>

2766
01:53:31.571 --> 01:53:35.930
<v Speaker 1>My sister dated him for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He used to imagine how have your sister</v>

2767
01:53:35.931 --> 01:53:37.400
<v Speaker 1>date the toughest guy in the school?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2768
01:53:37.500 --> 01:53:40.190
<v Speaker 1>he was a gorilla.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He used to be able to remember those</v>

2769
01:53:40.191 --> 01:53:42.280
<v Speaker 1>universal machines and where they had</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stack,</v>

2770
01:53:42.620 --> 01:53:44.540
<v Speaker 1>what was the stack like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two 50 or something like that.</v>

2771
01:53:44.630 --> 01:53:48.050
<v Speaker 1>He could bench the whole stack like</v>
<v Speaker 1>several times and everybody was like,</v>

2772
01:53:48.051 --> 01:53:49.300
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He does the stack.</v>

2773
01:53:49.430 --> 01:53:51.560
<v Speaker 1>He does that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had giant stretch marks all over his</v>

2774
01:53:51.561 --> 01:53:53.920
<v Speaker 1>tits and he was like 17 with these</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

2775
01:53:54.080 --> 01:53:56.030
<v Speaker 1>It is most likely a steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty sure.</v>

2776
01:53:56.210 --> 01:53:57.200
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ran into a many,</v>

2777
01:53:57.201 --> 01:53:59.060
<v Speaker 1>many years later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a great guy by the way.</v>

2778
01:53:59.510 --> 01:54:02.690
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was quite a bit smaller when I ran</v>

2779
01:54:02.691 --> 01:54:03.680
<v Speaker 1>into him many years later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2780
01:54:03.710 --> 01:54:05.150
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where's the</v>

2781
01:54:06.700 --> 01:54:07.940
<v Speaker 1>rest of you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

2782
01:54:08.240 --> 01:54:10.910
<v Speaker 1>that was back when people really didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>even understand steroids.</v>

2783
01:54:10.911 --> 01:54:12.530
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there wasn't a lot of people on them,</v>

2784
01:54:13.520 --> 01:54:15.830
<v Speaker 1>but my point being toughest kid in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>school beat the fuck out.</v>

2785
01:54:15.840 --> 01:54:19.460
<v Speaker 1>Everybody went to a college party and</v>
<v Speaker 1>beat the fuck out of a bunch of guys.</v>

2786
01:54:19.640 --> 01:54:20.900
<v Speaker 1>That'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2787
01:54:20.901 --> 01:54:23.210
<v Speaker 1>He knocked down the nation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'll carry over.</v>

2788
01:54:23.240 --> 01:54:26.090
<v Speaker 1>He was a brick shit house that kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

2789
01:54:26.150 --> 01:54:27.350
<v Speaker 1>but I understand what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

2790
01:54:27.380 --> 01:54:29.780
<v Speaker 1>This Donald Trump thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which which is interesting to me,</v>

2791
01:54:30.110 --> 01:54:35.110
<v Speaker 1>is that what he's done is he's gotten</v>
<v Speaker 1>the media to work for him because he</v>

2792
01:54:35.901 --> 01:54:39.020
<v Speaker 1>found a weakness in what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would they like to do is I'd like to</v>

2793
01:54:39.021 --> 01:54:42.290
<v Speaker 1>talk shit with the media likes to do is</v>
<v Speaker 1>they look to find something that they</v>

2794
01:54:42.291 --> 01:54:46.400
<v Speaker 1>feel like is going to be embarrassing or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that they can focus on and</v>

2795
01:54:46.401 --> 01:54:51.401
<v Speaker 1>really drone on and on about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with him he owns it and it's similar</v>

2796
01:54:51.681 --> 01:54:54.980
<v Speaker 1>to what you were talking about with</v>
<v Speaker 1>promoting yourself and promoting</v>

2797
01:54:54.981 --> 01:54:55.880
<v Speaker 1>yourself as a fighter.</v>

2798
01:54:56.090 --> 01:55:00.410
<v Speaker 1>He's promoting himself in a lot of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways the same way.</v>

2799
01:55:00.411 --> 01:55:02.270
<v Speaker 1>Kind of the you would do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2800
01:55:02.271 --> 01:55:06.980
<v Speaker 1>what he's doing is he's not apologizing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's saying provocative things and</v>

2801
01:55:06.981 --> 01:55:11.090
<v Speaker 1>because of that he gets more air time</v>
<v Speaker 1>than anybody else.</v>

2802
01:55:11.180 --> 01:55:13.760
<v Speaker 1>By far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not even close.</v>

2803
01:55:13.970 --> 01:55:18.710
<v Speaker 1>All the other guys in the Republican,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Republican candidates,</v>

2804
01:55:18.711 --> 01:55:21.350
<v Speaker 1>they were all playing second fiddle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were all trying to catch up.</v>

2805
01:55:21.520 --> 01:55:24.290
<v Speaker 1>They were even trying to do his thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Marco Rubio was making fun of his</v>

2806
01:55:24.291 --> 01:55:27.590
<v Speaker 1>hands and what does he do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He turns into a big Dick joke.</v>

2807
01:55:27.680 --> 01:55:28.690
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want my.</v>

2808
01:55:28.820 --> 01:55:30.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm fine in that department.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't want right.</v>

2809
01:55:30.980 --> 01:55:32.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm fine in that department,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everybody's like,</v>

2810
01:55:32.570 --> 01:55:33.590
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's holding it.</v>

2811
01:55:33.740 --> 01:55:35.990
<v Speaker 1>He's talking about his dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is amazing,</v>

2812
01:55:36.230 --> 01:55:41.230
<v Speaker 1>and it got him even more fans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people are tired of what the</v>

2813
01:55:41.271 --> 01:55:42.500
<v Speaker 1>game is right now.</v>

2814
01:55:42.620 --> 01:55:44.940
<v Speaker 1>What the is right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a guy gets on a podium,</v>

2815
01:55:45.060 --> 01:55:48.420
<v Speaker 1>he says a bunch of things that you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I know will fucking never happen.</v>

2816
01:55:48.750 --> 01:55:50.550
<v Speaker 1>Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody was hope and change.</v>

2817
01:55:50.551 --> 01:55:53.070
<v Speaker 1>Hope and change.</v>

2818
01:55:53.071 --> 01:55:56.580
<v Speaker 1>He's going to get us out of Iraq.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's going to get us out of Afghanistan.</v>

2819
01:55:56.760 --> 01:55:58.910
<v Speaker 1>We're still in Iraq.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're still in Afghanistan.</v>

<v Speaker 1>No change.</v>

2822
01:56:01.650 --> 01:56:05.250
<v Speaker 1>Drones are everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're gonna.</v>

2823
01:56:05.430 --> 01:56:07.200
<v Speaker 1>We're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let whistle blowers off the hook.</v>

2824
01:56:07.240 --> 01:56:09.810
<v Speaker 1>Bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cracks down on whistle blowers more than</v>

2825
01:56:09.811 --> 01:56:13.200
<v Speaker 1>anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More military than George W Bush.</v>

2826
01:56:13.290 --> 01:56:17.130
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>More more attacks on free press than any</v>

<v Speaker 1>a republican president,</v>

2828
01:56:19.950 --> 01:56:22.890
<v Speaker 1>but because he doesn't under the guise</v>
<v Speaker 1>of being on the left,</v>

2829
01:56:23.550 --> 01:56:27.030
<v Speaker 1>people don't look at the cold hard</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality of his actions.</v>

2830
01:56:27.031 --> 01:56:29.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's a bullshit fucking scam.</v>

2831
01:56:29.190 --> 01:56:33.060
<v Speaker 1>So this guy comes along and he plays it</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a pro wrestler.</v>

2832
01:56:33.210 --> 01:56:38.210
<v Speaker 1>He plays it like a reality TV star.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He plays it like a guy who is savvy</v>

2833
01:56:38.371 --> 01:56:41.340
<v Speaker 1>about the media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's been working the media his whole</v>

2834
01:56:41.341 --> 01:56:43.470
<v Speaker 1>career and it's working.</v>

2836
01:56:44.451 --> 01:56:45.950
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And to your point,</v>

2837
01:56:45.951 --> 01:56:50.250
<v Speaker 3>he is running his presidential campaign</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way Vince Mcmahon would promote a</v>

2838
01:56:50.251 --> 01:56:52.270
<v Speaker 3>wrestle mania and he's getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>attention.</v>

2839
01:56:52.290 --> 01:56:54.380
<v Speaker 3>He's evoking any emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Front row.</v>

2840
01:56:54.381 --> 01:56:56.260
<v Speaker 3>Brian actually told me that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who's watching right now?</v>

2841
01:56:56.261 --> 01:56:58.130
<v Speaker 3>He keeps texting me so quick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shout out to him.</v>

2842
01:56:58.131 --> 01:57:00.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm stealing his line,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's right about that and he's</v>

2843
01:57:00.201 --> 01:57:02.330
<v Speaker 3>evoking emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's getting people involved.</v>

2844
01:57:02.420 --> 01:57:04.790
<v Speaker 3>He understands that ratings are what get</v>
<v Speaker 3>you on TV.</v>

2845
01:57:04.791 --> 01:57:06.380
<v Speaker 3>He understands he can save money for</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2846
01:57:06.890 --> 01:57:10.430
<v Speaker 3>He's also refused to take donations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't want to be.</v>

2847
01:57:10.431 --> 01:57:13.240
<v Speaker 3>Body wants everybody to understand that</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's going to go in free and clear and</v>

2848
01:57:13.241 --> 01:57:14.110
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody anything but,</v>

2849
01:57:14.111 --> 01:57:15.020
<v Speaker 3>but he wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but wait a minute.</v>

2850
01:57:15.021 --> 01:57:17.540
<v Speaker 3>He just requested a bunch of donut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He took it back,</v>

2851
01:57:17.770 --> 01:57:18.591
<v Speaker 3>but he.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But Joe,</v>

2852
01:57:18.591 --> 01:57:19.940
<v Speaker 3>he was very candid about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

2853
01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.770
<v Speaker 3>I have been funding this myself any</v>
<v Speaker 3>scent,</v>

2854
01:57:22.790 --> 01:57:24.500
<v Speaker 3>and frankly I haven't gotten a very good</v>
<v Speaker 3>return.</v>

2855
01:57:24.620 --> 01:57:28.130
<v Speaker 3>I'm funding this myself so everybody</v>
<v Speaker 3>knows I'm not button sold that I haven't</v>

2856
01:57:28.131 --> 01:57:31.010
<v Speaker 3>made deals that I'm going to go in there</v>
<v Speaker 3>and actually represent the paypal.</v>

2857
01:57:31.011 --> 01:57:32.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to take a pay cut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go do a job.</v>

2858
01:57:32.871 --> 01:57:35.180
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to do it because it's a job</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I need to do.</v>

2859
01:57:35.960 --> 01:57:38.060
<v Speaker 3>That message didn't get out and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2860
01:57:38.061 --> 01:57:41.630
<v Speaker 3>I'm losing in the polls to somebody who</v>
<v Speaker 3>is bought and paid for because she's got</v>

2861
01:57:41.631 --> 01:57:44.030
<v Speaker 3>more money than me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You people don't seem to understand this</v>

2862
01:57:44.031 --> 01:57:47.030
<v Speaker 3>message of me going in there not owing</v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody anything.</v>

2863
01:57:47.210 --> 01:57:50.690
<v Speaker 3>I haven't got an investment on my return</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm thinking about taking it back</v>

2864
01:57:50.720 --> 01:57:51.700
<v Speaker 3>and open it up today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

2865
01:57:51.710 --> 01:57:53.990
<v Speaker 3>but he was very honest about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was very candid.</v>

2866
01:57:54.080 --> 01:57:56.660
<v Speaker 3>I thought he had like an emergency</v>
<v Speaker 3>drive.</v>

2867
01:57:56.690 --> 01:57:58.640
<v Speaker 3>He did and he just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He pulled the back.</v>

2868
01:57:58.940 --> 01:57:59.431
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2869
01:57:59.431 --> 01:57:59.660
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2870
01:57:59.660 --> 01:58:01.730
<v Speaker 3>What I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You had the emergency drought,</v>

2871
01:58:01.731 --> 01:58:03.020
<v Speaker 3>but that was interesting too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

2872
01:58:03.021 --> 01:58:05.180
<v Speaker 3>I want to raise $10,000,000 in two days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and by the way,</v>

2873
01:58:05.181 --> 01:58:07.580
<v Speaker 3>if you guys give me 10,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll throw another tenant on myself.</v>

2874
01:58:07.880 --> 01:58:10.550
<v Speaker 3>So he ended up matching.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He put 20 million and then he did it</v>

2875
01:58:10.551 --> 01:58:11.450
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was such a success.</v>

2876
01:58:11.451 --> 01:58:12.284
<v Speaker 3>He did it again.</v>

2877
01:58:12.730 --> 01:58:13.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2878
01:58:13.330 --> 01:58:18.330
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird situation for the Democrats</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if Hillary did get indicted and</v>

2879
01:58:19.091 --> 01:58:21.580
<v Speaker 1>if Hillary did wind up getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>convicted,</v>

2880
01:58:21.600 --> 01:58:24.490
<v Speaker 1>are they punished her in any way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's over.</v>

2881
01:58:24.760 --> 01:58:25.960
<v Speaker 1>That's hides over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2882
01:58:26.290 --> 01:58:28.840
<v Speaker 1>So who else is there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bernie Sanders.</v>

2883
01:58:29.800 --> 01:58:30.960
<v Speaker 1>They don't want that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2884
01:58:31.060 --> 01:58:34.480
<v Speaker 1>Nobody wants that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just crazy old socialists.</v>

2885
01:58:34.650 --> 01:58:39.480
<v Speaker 3>A lot of a lot of people is Vermont.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's picking up a Elizabeth Warren as</v>

2886
01:58:39.481 --> 01:58:40.011
<v Speaker 3>her running mate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2887
01:58:40.011 --> 01:58:42.130
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think she's cognizant enough</v>

2888
01:58:42.220 --> 01:58:44.530
<v Speaker 2>to know that America does not want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>look sexist,</v>

2889
01:58:44.531 --> 01:58:47.770
<v Speaker 2>but it in fact is that America is going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have a hard time putting a female as</v>

2890
01:58:47.771 --> 01:58:51.820
<v Speaker 2>the commander and chief of the military</v>
<v Speaker 2>who doesn't come out and endorse</v>

2891
01:58:51.821 --> 01:58:53.500
<v Speaker 2>anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you talk to them privately,</v>

2892
01:58:53.501 --> 01:58:55.690
<v Speaker 2>they do not want to be led by a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a reality.</v>

2893
01:58:56.350 --> 01:59:00.760
<v Speaker 2>I think she's smart enough to know they</v>
<v Speaker 2>damn sure don't want to be led by two</v>

2894
01:59:00.761 --> 01:59:01.390
<v Speaker 2>but there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

2895
01:59:01.390 --> 01:59:02.950
<v Speaker 2>But of course would never say that</v>
<v Speaker 2>publicly.</v>

2896
01:59:02.951 --> 01:59:04.330
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't want to look sexist as a</v>

2897
01:59:04.331 --> 01:59:08.500
<v Speaker 2>country even though we are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If Hillary wants to put the nail in the</v>

2898
01:59:08.501 --> 01:59:10.540
<v Speaker 2>coffin of this campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she puts.</v>

2899
01:59:10.541 --> 01:59:14.080
<v Speaker 2>Bill is our VP.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She does not have an ego that would</v>

2900
01:59:14.081 --> 01:59:18.150
<v Speaker 2>allow her to do such and I think she</v>
<v Speaker 2>might make the air of putting Elizabeth</v>

2901
01:59:18.170 --> 01:59:19.870
<v Speaker 1>warning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

2902
01:59:19.871 --> 01:59:23.380
<v Speaker 1>that would be a weird thing because</v>
<v Speaker 1>Elizabeth Warren pretended that she was</v>

2903
01:59:23.381 --> 01:59:24.610
<v Speaker 1>native American.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2904
01:59:25.300 --> 01:59:27.070
<v Speaker 2>She lied.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Straight up lie and that's racist.</v>

2905
01:59:27.470 --> 01:59:29.470
<v Speaker 2>No way around that whole cultural</v>
<v Speaker 2>appropriation.</v>

2906
01:59:29.471 --> 01:59:31.750
<v Speaker 2>That's a big thing today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no way around that one.</v>

2907
01:59:31.840 --> 01:59:34.150
<v Speaker 2>She should've did and then what she</v>
<v Speaker 2>commented on her.</v>

2908
01:59:34.260 --> 01:59:35.380
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my eyes look this way.</v>

2909
01:59:35.381 --> 01:59:35.771
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2910
01:59:35.771 --> 01:59:38.880
<v Speaker 2>it got bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It got bad and trump instead of just.</v>

2911
01:59:39.040 --> 01:59:41.170
<v Speaker 2>Instead of saying it the way you use it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you know you lied about me.</v>

2912
01:59:41.230 --> 01:59:43.570
<v Speaker 2>He called her pocahontas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pocahontas.</v>

2913
01:59:43.980 --> 01:59:46.630
<v Speaker 2>Everybody says that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says it more will.</v>

2914
01:59:46.631 --> 01:59:50.210
<v Speaker 2>He calls Bernie Sanders crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bernie called Hillary Lion.</v>

2915
01:59:50.260 --> 01:59:51.190
<v Speaker 2>Hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crooked,</v>

2916
01:59:51.460 --> 01:59:52.750
<v Speaker 2>crooked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crooked Hillary.</v>

2917
01:59:52.751 --> 01:59:53.830
<v Speaker 2>That's smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2918
01:59:53.831 --> 01:59:57.330
<v Speaker 2>look what he does by labeling them and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then a white lion.</v>

2919
01:59:57.340 --> 01:59:59.170
<v Speaker 2>Ted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>

2920
01:59:59.260 --> 02:00:00.950
<v Speaker 2>It's wrestling me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He gave me the ball.</v>

2921
02:00:01.030 --> 02:00:02.620
<v Speaker 2>He didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He gave them all a gimmick.</v>

2922
02:00:02.680 --> 02:00:03.850
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he juked the system.</v>

2923
02:00:03.880 --> 02:00:07.240
<v Speaker 1>The system was based on deception the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first place and they had this whole</v>

2924
02:00:07.900 --> 02:00:11.230
<v Speaker 1>standard operation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way they would run things,</v>

2925
02:00:11.260 --> 02:00:15.840
<v Speaker 1>they would all do it the exact same way</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he came in and exposed all the flaws</v>

2926
02:00:15.841 --> 02:00:17.200
<v Speaker 1>in the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2927
02:00:17.540 --> 02:00:20.350
<v Speaker 1>And he's not done and he's not backing</v>
<v Speaker 1>off and everybody keeps waiting in the</v>

2928
02:00:20.351 --> 02:00:24.580
<v Speaker 1>backyard it because it's not the real</v>
<v Speaker 1>presidential candidate.</v>

2929
02:00:24.610 --> 02:00:26.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the real campaign yet.</v>

2930
02:00:26.561 --> 02:00:31.120
<v Speaker 1>The real campaign begins once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is absolutely hillary and absolutely</v>

2931
02:00:31.121 --> 02:00:34.870
<v Speaker 1>him and it gets boiled down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like right now we're in July when it</v>

2932
02:00:34.871 --> 02:00:38.950
<v Speaker 1>gets to be August and then September,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when Shit's gonna really start</v>

2933
02:00:38.951 --> 02:00:43.540
<v Speaker 1>flying and you know it's going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting to see what he uses to try</v>

2934
02:00:43.541 --> 02:00:48.190
<v Speaker 1>to attack her and what she used to try</v>
<v Speaker 1>to attack him and how both there they're</v>

2935
02:00:48.191 --> 02:00:52.090
<v Speaker 1>both going to get damaged in the process</v>
<v Speaker 1>and our system is going to be damaged in</v>

2936
02:00:52.091 --> 02:00:55.780
<v Speaker 1>the process and that's something that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think everybody is kind of cognizant of</v>

2937
02:00:55.781 --> 02:00:59.500
<v Speaker 1>when you destroy someone who is on their</v>
<v Speaker 1>way to become the commander and chief,</v>

2938
02:00:59.530 --> 02:01:03.410
<v Speaker 1>you kind of weak in the whole nation</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that person becomes the like,</v>

2939
02:01:03.550 --> 02:01:05.740
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if Hillary won,</v>

2940
02:01:05.910 --> 02:01:09.040
<v Speaker 1>say if the elections were tomorrow and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the FBI thing happened today and then</v>

2941
02:01:09.041 --> 02:01:10.710
<v Speaker 1>she winds tomorrow and everybody's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be like,</v>

2942
02:01:10.740 --> 02:01:13.780
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know she did something that we would</v>

2943
02:01:13.781 --> 02:01:14.620
<v Speaker 1>have been punished for.</v>

2944
02:01:14.740 --> 02:01:18.700
<v Speaker 1>How is this weakens the position and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>weakens it in the eyes of the world too.</v>

2945
02:01:18.701 --> 02:01:19.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure</v>

2946
02:01:19.400 --> 02:01:20.450
<v Speaker 2>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does.</v>

2947
02:01:20.451 --> 02:01:23.420
<v Speaker 2>When we talk about vp picks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure that they've got to write.</v>

2948
02:01:23.421 --> 02:01:26.390
<v Speaker 2>The media thinks they've got it narrowed</v>
<v Speaker 2>down to four guys and they added one</v>

2949
02:01:26.391 --> 02:01:29.910
<v Speaker 2>more for trump on trump's side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christy and Gingrich and pence and</v>

2950
02:01:30.130 --> 02:01:32.060
<v Speaker 2>they've.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've got five and I don't think</v>

2951
02:01:32.061 --> 02:01:34.490
<v Speaker 2>they're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that he will go outside the box.</v>

2952
02:01:34.760 --> 02:01:38.270
<v Speaker 2>He's not going to put a woman in there</v>
<v Speaker 2>just just to put a vagina on the ticket</v>

2953
02:01:38.271 --> 02:01:40.010
<v Speaker 2>and think he's going to do like mccain</v>
<v Speaker 2>did with</v>

2954
02:01:40.110 --> 02:01:42.380
<v Speaker 3>Pailin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's going to bring in somebody</v>

2955
02:01:42.381 --> 02:01:45.440
<v Speaker 3>that's either got admiral or colonel or</v>
<v Speaker 3>general next to their name.</v>

2956
02:01:45.441 --> 02:01:50.441
<v Speaker 3>I think that it is very important for</v>
<v Speaker 3>him to look powerful and be powerful and</v>

2957
02:01:50.541 --> 02:01:53.360
<v Speaker 3>I think he wants a military guy and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think that's who he admires.</v>

2958
02:01:53.361 --> 02:01:56.720
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he admires politicians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he admires soldiers.</v>

2959
02:01:56.840 --> 02:02:00.620
<v Speaker 1>That would be interesting if he did that</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that would be a huge step up if he</v>

2960
02:02:00.621 --> 02:02:04.670
<v Speaker 1>did do that and in in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of like how public responded to</v>

2961
02:02:04.671 --> 02:02:06.650
<v Speaker 1>him because if he's like the big</v>
<v Speaker 1>showman,</v>

2962
02:02:06.920 --> 02:02:11.150
<v Speaker 1>but he's got some very serious guy with</v>
<v Speaker 1>some real world experience as his second</v>

2963
02:02:11.151 --> 02:02:13.130
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be a really interesting.</v>

2964
02:02:13.160 --> 02:02:16.010
<v Speaker 1>It's just to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just disturbing that we're down to</v>

2965
02:02:16.011 --> 02:02:19.990
<v Speaker 1>a reality TV star and an old lady trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get back at her husband for a blow</v>

2966
02:02:19.991 --> 02:02:21.610
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got in the nineties show.</v>

2967
02:02:21.650 --> 02:02:22.483
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing is</v>

2968
02:02:22.540 --> 02:02:26.010
<v Speaker 3>disturbing Bill Clinton tree to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>White House like it was a frat and I</v>

2969
02:02:26.011 --> 02:02:28.470
<v Speaker 3>will forever appreciate that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just will.</v>

2970
02:02:28.590 --> 02:02:29.490
<v Speaker 3>I just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2971
02:02:29.520 --> 02:02:31.730
<v Speaker 3>I mean he was a mess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was all these different.</v>

2972
02:02:31.770 --> 02:02:34.190
<v Speaker 3>He was unapologetic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was the master liar member.</v>

2973
02:02:34.200 --> 02:02:37.530
<v Speaker 3>The divisible in the not denominator and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was going in all these circles and</v>

2974
02:02:37.531 --> 02:02:39.390
<v Speaker 3>before you're done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just flat out confused,</v>

2975
02:02:39.970 --> 02:02:41.700
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That Oxford degree really sent me in</v>

2976
02:02:41.701 --> 02:02:43.290
<v Speaker 3>circles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess we give this guy a pass.</v>

2977
02:02:43.291 --> 02:02:44.610
<v Speaker 3>He's an odd dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2978
02:02:44.640 --> 02:02:48.180
<v Speaker 3>He's a very odd dude and he still swing</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's still swinging out there for</v>

2979
02:02:48.181 --> 02:02:49.440
<v Speaker 3>his wife.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2980
02:02:49.510 --> 02:02:51.220
<v Speaker 3>And See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's another one though,</v>

2981
02:02:51.221 --> 02:02:52.100
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't mind me interrupting,</v>

2982
02:02:52.110 --> 02:02:54.210
<v Speaker 3>if he would've just told the truth back</v>
<v Speaker 3>then,</v>

2983
02:02:54.211 --> 02:02:56.430
<v Speaker 3>just use the truth on a site.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would have all been done if he</v>

2984
02:02:56.431 --> 02:02:57.181
<v Speaker 3>would've just said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2985
02:02:57.181 --> 02:02:59.280
<v Speaker 3>I'll sleep with anything in the world</v>
<v Speaker 3>except her.</v>

2986
02:03:00.290 --> 02:03:03.540
<v Speaker 3>If he would've just done that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'd be all over and said he started</v>

2987
02:03:03.541 --> 02:03:05.520
<v Speaker 3>getting crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he would've hit them with that line.</v>

2988
02:03:05.521 --> 02:03:06.450
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the same thing.</v>

2989
02:03:06.630 --> 02:03:07.920
<v Speaker 3>It's the same thing with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2990
02:03:07.950 --> 02:03:09.630
<v Speaker 3>with trump right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he would have just said,</v>

2991
02:03:09.631 --> 02:03:11.250
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that America should have a long</v>

2992
02:03:11.251 --> 02:03:13.020
<v Speaker 3>leash,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but attached to that Leisha is a big old</v>

2993
02:03:13.021 --> 02:03:15.990
<v Speaker 3>bomb and this is how we're going to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>it and we'll light the thing if we have</v>

2994
02:03:15.991 --> 02:03:18.240
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to deal with.</v>

2995
02:03:18.300 --> 02:03:20.100
<v Speaker 3>It's really hard to deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got all of this,</v>

2996
02:03:20.101 --> 02:03:24.090
<v Speaker 3>this philosophy from you giving me your</v>
<v Speaker 3>take on how Michael Richards should have</v>

2997
02:03:24.091 --> 02:03:26.700
<v Speaker 3>handed the comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you said he should've come out,</v>

2998
02:03:26.880 --> 02:03:28.020
<v Speaker 3>he should have said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's my problems.</v>

2999
02:03:28.050 --> 02:03:29.430
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a funny comic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3000
02:03:29.431 --> 02:03:31.830
<v Speaker 3>I was self conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You guys made me feel bad.</v>

3001
02:03:31.831 --> 02:03:33.720
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to hurt your feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Had nothing to do with race.</v>

3002
02:03:33.870 --> 02:03:36.510
<v Speaker 3>I tried to hurt your feelings and you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

3003
02:03:36.540 --> 02:03:37.980
<v Speaker 3>It all would have gone away because we</v>
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>

3004
02:03:38.030 --> 02:03:38.540
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

3005
02:03:38.540 --> 02:03:39.730
<v Speaker 3>that is what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3006
02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:40.670
<v Speaker 3>it is what happened.</v>

3007
02:03:40.670 --> 02:03:42.710
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's precisely with Charlie Sheen</v>

3008
02:03:42.711 --> 02:03:45.260
<v Speaker 1>did when Charlie Sheen came out and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

3009
02:03:45.261 --> 02:03:46.550
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is how I roll.</v>

3010
02:03:46.551 --> 02:03:49.730
<v Speaker 1>I smoke rocks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I pay girls to leave.</v>

3011
02:03:49.910 --> 02:03:52.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't pay him to have sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everyone was like,</v>

3012
02:03:52.191 --> 02:03:53.670
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

3013
02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:55.580
<v Speaker 1>what do you say to that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't say anything.</v>

3014
02:03:55.581 --> 02:03:58.520
<v Speaker 1>And everybody was Hashtag Tiger blood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was all over the.</v>

3015
02:03:58.700 --> 02:04:02.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean he became sort of until the HIV</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing came that kind of put an</v>

3016
02:04:02.510 --> 02:04:02.840
<v Speaker 1>accountant</v>

3017
02:04:02.840 --> 02:04:04.460
<v Speaker 3>that put a damper,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're right.</v>

3018
02:04:04.461 --> 02:04:07.790
<v Speaker 3>Sheen was the original Shin was the</v>
<v Speaker 3>originalist sat in the hot speed.</v>

3019
02:04:07.791 --> 02:04:11.540
<v Speaker 3>Everybody was waiting for the tearful</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jon Jones style apology and it did not</v>

3020
02:04:11.541 --> 02:04:14.140
<v Speaker 3>come.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She huge because it ended up doing a</v>

3021
02:04:14.150 --> 02:04:16.980
<v Speaker 3>comedy or a an appearance tour,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever he saw.</v>

3022
02:04:16.981 --> 02:04:21.260
<v Speaker 3>He did seven and a half million dollars</v>
<v Speaker 3>in tickets on a two week tour because of</v>

3023
02:04:21.261 --> 02:04:23.690
<v Speaker 3>that one sit down where he refused to</v>
<v Speaker 3>apologize.</v>

3024
02:04:23.691 --> 02:04:24.790
<v Speaker 3>Why I like to party.</v>

3025
02:04:24.970 --> 02:04:27.280
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even have any comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't know what to do,</v>

3026
02:04:27.281 --> 02:04:30.850
<v Speaker 1>so he went to these things coked up</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking he was just going to power</v>

3027
02:04:30.851 --> 02:04:34.510
<v Speaker 1>through it with charisma and people were</v>
<v Speaker 1>bu in and people and he's like,</v>

3028
02:04:34.511 --> 02:04:35.470
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got your money.</v>

3029
02:04:35.471 --> 02:04:38.280
<v Speaker 1>I already got your money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is fucking crazy</v>

3030
02:04:38.280 --> 02:04:40.230
<v Speaker 4>to yell out of people that have bought</v>
<v Speaker 4>your tickets.</v>

3031
02:04:40.350 --> 02:04:42.900
<v Speaker 4>But then he adjusted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He got smart and you brought guys like</v>

3032
02:04:42.901 --> 02:04:46.560
<v Speaker 4>Russell Peters in to sit down with them</v>
<v Speaker 4>and interview him and they actually</v>

3033
02:04:46.561 --> 02:04:49.890
<v Speaker 4>worked out a routine and it actually</v>
<v Speaker 4>became an entertaining show towards the</v>

3034
02:04:49.891 --> 02:04:54.510
<v Speaker 4>last leg of the tour.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But his ability to step up and say,</v>

3035
02:04:54.540 --> 02:04:56.130
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like coke.</v>

3036
02:04:56.340 --> 02:04:58.800
<v Speaker 4>I like to smoke coke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get together.</v>

3037
02:04:58.801 --> 02:05:00.660
<v Speaker 4>I get a bunch of girls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I pay him money.</v>

3038
02:05:00.810 --> 02:05:03.000
<v Speaker 4>I fucked up and then they leave and</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody's like,</v>

3039
02:05:03.001 --> 02:05:05.250
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because that's what everybody's always</v>

3040
02:05:05.340 --> 02:05:10.340
<v Speaker 4>avoided to catch someone always doing</v>
<v Speaker 4>trucks like prostitute.</v>

3041
02:05:10.860 --> 02:05:12.750
<v Speaker 4>The cover up is always worse than the</v>
<v Speaker 4>crime.</v>

3042
02:05:12.751 --> 02:05:14.100
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you go back to John Jones,</v>

3043
02:05:14.370 --> 02:05:16.020
<v Speaker 4>John Jones gets tagged in that coke</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

3044
02:05:16.021 --> 02:05:20.290
<v Speaker 4>He pops on Fox and the and the woman</v>
<v Speaker 4>asks him why he did it and that was Sam</v>

3045
02:05:20.290 --> 02:05:20.531
<v Speaker 4>Johnson.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3046
02:05:20.531 --> 02:05:21.181
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but any,</v>

3047
02:05:21.181 --> 02:05:22.440
<v Speaker 4>any try to dance around.</v>

3048
02:05:22.440 --> 02:05:26.160
<v Speaker 4>He had his pocket of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did it to get high.</v>

3049
02:05:26.400 --> 02:05:27.600
<v Speaker 4>Next question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stupid.</v>

3050
02:05:27.630 --> 02:05:29.130
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

3051
02:05:29.160 --> 02:05:29.701
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3052
02:05:29.701 --> 02:05:31.770
<v Speaker 4>it was funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was at a party having a good time.</v>

3053
02:05:31.771 --> 02:05:33.630
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know you're going to test me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3054
02:05:34.380 --> 02:05:36.870
<v Speaker 4>That's the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But use the truth on your side is just,</v>

3055
02:05:36.871 --> 02:05:39.540
<v Speaker 4>it just shuts everybody down and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's endearing and refreshing.</v>

3056
02:05:40.050 --> 02:05:40.680
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

3057
02:05:40.680 --> 02:05:42.630
<v Speaker 4>this current thing that he's on right</v>
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>

3058
02:05:42.690 --> 02:05:45.300
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if he can do that with this.</v>

3059
02:05:45.330 --> 02:05:47.700
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if he knows what it was that he</v>

3060
02:05:47.701 --> 02:05:48.491
<v Speaker 4>took.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3061
02:05:48.491 --> 02:05:49.470
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just don't know.</v>

3062
02:05:49.890 --> 02:05:50.980
<v Speaker 4>I know I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm really,</v>

3063
02:05:51.050 --> 02:05:54.750
<v Speaker 4>I'm confused by this one because I don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>know how many different options there</v>

3064
02:05:54.751 --> 02:05:58.020
<v Speaker 4>could have been where these are the two</v>
<v Speaker 4>things that he tested positive for.</v>

3065
02:05:58.110 --> 02:06:01.350
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how many options there</v>
<v Speaker 4>could have been other than him taking</v>

3066
02:06:01.351 --> 02:06:03.120
<v Speaker 4>that because he was getting off</v>
<v Speaker 4>steroids,</v>

3067
02:06:03.121 --> 02:06:07.530
<v Speaker 4>but that doesn't even seem to make sense</v>
<v Speaker 4>because he had been tested like much</v>

3068
02:06:07.531 --> 02:06:11.790
<v Speaker 4>more recently or before that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like we're close to that and he didn't</v>

3069
02:06:11.791 --> 02:06:14.310
<v Speaker 4>have that in his system and he didn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>have steroids in a system.</v>

3070
02:06:14.670 --> 02:06:18.810
<v Speaker 4>But to victor context credit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Victor Conte did question.</v>

3071
02:06:18.811 --> 02:06:23.811
<v Speaker 4>Jon Jones is a testosterone levels and</v>
<v Speaker 4>EPA testosterone levels before carbon</v>

3072
02:06:25.471 --> 02:06:26.640
<v Speaker 4>isotope tents.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

3073
02:06:27.330 --> 02:06:28.970
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they were for Gazy.</v>

3074
02:06:29.940 --> 02:06:34.440
<v Speaker 4>What could cause that at various same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All you're going to do is confuse people</v>

3075
02:06:34.441 --> 02:06:37.200
<v Speaker 4>when you start talking about that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and frankly you can't get doctors to</v>

3076
02:06:37.201 --> 02:06:38.580
<v Speaker 4>totally agree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even with Sada,</v>

3077
02:06:38.600 --> 02:06:40.230
<v Speaker 4>with their highest scientists and</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything there.</v>

3078
02:06:40.231 --> 02:06:41.670
<v Speaker 4>There's some confusion there.</v>

3079
02:06:42.030 --> 02:06:44.580
<v Speaker 3>There was something for gazy going on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it wasn't enough.</v>

3080
02:06:44.610 --> 02:06:47.620
<v Speaker 3>It was just enough to start rumors not</v>
<v Speaker 3>to actually take him in and,</v>

3081
02:06:48.030 --> 02:06:49.470
<v Speaker 3>and go against him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

3082
02:06:49.471 --> 02:06:51.900
<v Speaker 3>you glossed over what I opened the show</v>
<v Speaker 3>with and I thought it was going to be</v>

3083
02:06:51.901 --> 02:06:53.550
<v Speaker 3>one of the high points of the whole</v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast.</v>

3084
02:06:53.820 --> 02:06:55.160
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know if you had to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3085
02:06:55.161 --> 02:06:56.750
<v Speaker 3>not the cop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you had this,</v>

3086
02:06:56.820 --> 02:07:00.180
<v Speaker 3>so I don't mean to go back to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the point that this test that we're</v>

3087
02:07:00.181 --> 02:07:02.790
<v Speaker 3>all talking about is June 16th and there</v>
<v Speaker 3>could.</v>

3088
02:07:02.840 --> 02:07:04.950
<v Speaker 3>There's got to be another shoe that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting ready to drop now.</v>

3089
02:07:04.951 --> 02:07:06.870
<v Speaker 3>Whether that comes back hot or what it</v>
<v Speaker 3>comes back clean,</v>

3090
02:07:06.871 --> 02:07:09.110
<v Speaker 3>we don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there is no way that Assad sought</v>

3091
02:07:09.180 --> 02:07:13.240
<v Speaker 3>last time testing a guy for a fight that</v>
<v Speaker 3>was supposed to take place this last</v>

3092
02:07:13.240 --> 02:07:14.071
<v Speaker 3>Saturday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was June 60.</v>

3093
02:07:14.071 --> 02:07:17.340
<v Speaker 3>There's just no way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've got to be at least another test</v>

3094
02:07:17.341 --> 02:07:21.770
<v Speaker 3>out there and possibly to brock lesnar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They test him every other day for stuff</v>

3095
02:07:21.840 --> 02:07:22.380
<v Speaker 3>five</v>

3096
02:07:22.380 --> 02:07:25.140
<v Speaker 4>times within the first two weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was in the first two weeks.</v>

3097
02:07:25.440 --> 02:07:27.180
<v Speaker 4>Eight times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Same thing.</v>

3098
02:07:27.181 --> 02:07:29.520
<v Speaker 4>They did the same thing to her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They tested her a ton of times.</v>

3099
02:07:30.270 --> 02:07:31.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

3100
02:07:31.350 --> 02:07:33.750
<v Speaker 4>I mean we.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is just speculation,</v>

3101
02:07:33.751 --> 02:07:35.680
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We really won't know and I'm sure we'll</v>

3102
02:07:35.681 --> 02:07:36.070
<v Speaker 4>find</v>

3103
02:07:36.070 --> 02:07:40.420
<v Speaker 1>out shortly because those tests take a</v>
<v Speaker 1>while to get the results back because</v>

3104
02:07:40.421 --> 02:07:43.090
<v Speaker 1>they're very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very thorough and if he tested June</v>

3105
02:07:43.091 --> 02:07:44.890
<v Speaker 1>16th,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to assume big,</v>

3106
02:07:44.891 --> 02:07:46.780
<v Speaker 1>high profile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>UFC 200.</v>

3107
02:07:47.260 --> 02:07:49.660
<v Speaker 1>And the guy was already tested positive</v>
<v Speaker 1>for some time before.</v>

3108
02:07:49.661 --> 02:07:51.610
<v Speaker 1>So they're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're gonna be sneaking around trying</v>

3109
02:07:51.611 --> 02:07:54.280
<v Speaker 1>to catch him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was the crazy story where he went?</v>

3110
02:07:54.550 --> 02:07:56.800
<v Speaker 1>He was hiding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that true?</v>

3111
02:07:57.340 --> 02:07:58.810
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell the story.</v>

3112
02:07:58.830 --> 02:07:59.710
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's tell the story.</v>

3113
02:08:00.640 --> 02:08:03.310
<v Speaker 1>Assata came in and it gives us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

3114
02:08:03.311 --> 02:08:04.610
<v Speaker 1>this is a legend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

3115
02:08:04.640 --> 02:08:05.473
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3116
02:08:05.720 --> 02:08:06.680
<v Speaker 2>Story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The story.</v>

3117
02:08:06.800 --> 02:08:08.980
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this from some,</v>

3118
02:08:09.070 --> 02:08:11.540
<v Speaker 2>some of those teammates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>UFC fighters that claimed they were</v>

3119
02:08:11.541 --> 02:08:12.860
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that.</v>

3120
02:08:12.980 --> 02:08:15.650
<v Speaker 2>And that doesn't make it true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Myfi guys tired of him beating the fuck</v>

3121
02:08:15.651 --> 02:08:18.890
<v Speaker 2>out of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the disclaimers aside.</v>

3122
02:08:18.891 --> 02:08:20.410
<v Speaker 2>Let's get down to the entertainment side</v>
<v Speaker 2>of this.</v>

3123
02:08:20.411 --> 02:08:25.411
<v Speaker 2>So solder rolls in to Jackson's gym to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do a test on John Jones and there was</v>

3124
02:08:25.641 --> 02:08:27.470
<v Speaker 2>only some coaches in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And John,</v>

3125
02:08:27.471 --> 02:08:31.220
<v Speaker 2>if there was like five people there at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the time so he can see them coming.</v>

3126
02:08:31.260 --> 02:08:33.830
<v Speaker 2>They where they parked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he can see them coming so they don't</v>

3127
02:08:33.831 --> 02:08:36.350
<v Speaker 2>know what to do with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They hide them underneath the cage.</v>

3128
02:08:36.560 --> 02:08:38.390
<v Speaker 2>They hired John John tides up to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>cage.</v>

3129
02:08:39.020 --> 02:08:43.610
<v Speaker 2>They tell John we don't know where he is</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is before we were enrolled in</v>

3130
02:08:43.611 --> 02:08:46.340
<v Speaker 2>the program and he did not need to</v>
<v Speaker 2>disclose his whereabouts.</v>

3131
02:08:46.340 --> 02:08:49.190
<v Speaker 2>At the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they show up and find you,</v>

3132
02:08:49.400 --> 02:08:52.040
<v Speaker 2>you must tap vandelay this situation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you must test.</v>

3133
02:08:52.460 --> 02:08:54.360
<v Speaker 2>They can't find you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You didn't have to test back this.</v>

3134
02:08:54.361 --> 02:08:56.510
<v Speaker 2>So anyway you hides under the ring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>

3135
02:08:56.511 --> 02:08:57.770
<v Speaker 2>well where is he supposed to?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3136
02:08:57.950 --> 02:08:59.120
<v Speaker 2>this is Jim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>

3137
02:08:59.130 --> 02:09:02.690
<v Speaker 2>well how would I know where he is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So instead of leaving like they thought</v>

3138
02:09:02.691 --> 02:09:04.010
<v Speaker 2>they would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do they take a seat?</v>

3139
02:09:04.340 --> 02:09:06.980
<v Speaker 2>Well there's like eight hours left in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the business day.</v>

3140
02:09:06.981 --> 02:09:08.330
<v Speaker 2>They don't ever leave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

3141
02:09:08.331 --> 02:09:12.470
<v Speaker 2>along with six to eight hour timeframe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>John's under the cage the entire time.</v>

3142
02:09:12.680 --> 02:09:14.630
<v Speaker 2>So people are coming and going the whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

3143
02:09:14.631 --> 02:09:17.330
<v Speaker 2>And finally they shut the lights off and</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to lock the doors.</v>

3144
02:09:17.331 --> 02:09:20.870
<v Speaker 2>Now John can come out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we found out about that and they</v>

3145
02:09:20.871 --> 02:09:21.860
<v Speaker 2>want it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't do this.</v>

3146
02:09:21.861 --> 02:09:26.861
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to get a warrant and go</v>
<v Speaker 2>under that ring under the theory that at</v>

3147
02:09:27.261 --> 02:09:29.300
<v Speaker 2>some point in that six to eight hour</v>
<v Speaker 2>span,</v>

3148
02:09:29.301 --> 02:09:33.110
<v Speaker 2>he would've had a pee where they wanted</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go under forensically and collect</v>

3149
02:09:33.111 --> 02:09:33.560
<v Speaker 2>that urine.</v>

3150
02:09:33.560 --> 02:09:36.380
<v Speaker 2>That's how upset they were that they had</v>
<v Speaker 2>been had.</v>

3151
02:09:36.770 --> 02:09:40.550
<v Speaker 2>Now I realize that we're saying all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>nice to have a that happened.</v>

3152
02:09:40.970 --> 02:09:42.870
<v Speaker 2>How long was the timeframe and all of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

3153
02:09:42.871 --> 02:09:43.704
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that part.</v>

3154
02:09:43.820 --> 02:09:47.030
<v Speaker 2>That part's coming after him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>After that,</v>

3155
02:09:47.031 --> 02:09:49.490
<v Speaker 2>when they found out that they had been</v>
<v Speaker 2>to anything they hate,</v>

3156
02:09:49.520 --> 02:09:52.190
<v Speaker 2>they don't like when people say their</v>
<v Speaker 2>test doesn't work and they don't like</v>

3157
02:09:52.191 --> 02:09:55.930
<v Speaker 2>being duped and they came after.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember when I predicted rumbled,</v>

3158
02:09:55.931 --> 02:09:57.910
<v Speaker 2>Jones will not happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes you did.</v>

3159
02:09:57.950 --> 02:10:01.520
<v Speaker 2>That's because I had that story and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>knew soda was looking for him.</v>

3160
02:10:01.521 --> 02:10:05.540
<v Speaker 2>I knew they had boots on the ground in</v>
<v Speaker 2>albuquerque waiting for him to lead the</v>

3161
02:10:05.541 --> 02:10:07.880
<v Speaker 2>club late and for it to get him for</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

3162
02:10:07.881 --> 02:10:09.680
<v Speaker 2>I was armed with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never told that.</v>

3163
02:10:09.681 --> 02:10:11.570
<v Speaker 2>So that's why I predict that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What had happened,</v>

3164
02:10:11.571 --> 02:10:15.440
<v Speaker 2>I knew they were after him and this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>before we had to do the whereabouts like</v>

3165
02:10:15.441 --> 02:10:17.990
<v Speaker 2>we do now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Back then it was just random and they</v>

3166
02:10:17.991 --> 02:10:19.370
<v Speaker 2>had people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were just waiting.</v>

3167
02:10:19.460 --> 02:10:21.650
<v Speaker 2>They were just waiting for the right</v>
<v Speaker 2>time and they were going to grab him.</v>

3168
02:10:22.030 --> 02:10:24.830
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To get a.</v>

3169
02:10:25.230 --> 02:10:28.090
<v Speaker 1>If they got a warrant to check</v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath the well,</v>

3170
02:10:28.091 --> 02:10:29.390
<v Speaker 1>how would they prove that it was his</v>
<v Speaker 1>pee?</v>

3171
02:10:29.550 --> 02:10:32.330
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of fighters or dirty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of problems,</v>

3172
02:10:32.360 --> 02:10:33.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just in just</v>

3173
02:10:34.460 --> 02:10:35.720
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to show support.</v>

3174
02:10:35.721 --> 02:10:37.880
<v Speaker 2>They could all just whip their dicks out</v>
<v Speaker 2>and pea underneath the cage.</v>

3175
02:10:37.881 --> 02:10:38.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

3176
02:10:38.690 --> 02:10:42.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you really love the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pollute the water better yet,</v>

3177
02:10:42.291 --> 02:10:44.060
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go under and you clean underneath</v>

3178
02:10:44.061 --> 02:10:45.920
<v Speaker 2>the cage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would also solve the problem,</v>

3179
02:10:45.921 --> 02:10:48.050
<v Speaker 2>but it turns out John's pregnant.</v>

02:10:48.140 --> 02:10:52.370

<v Speaker 2>it was just a mess,</v>

3181
02:10:52.371 --> 02:10:53.270
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

3182

02:11:30.561 --> 02:11:32.510
<v Speaker 2>Invitational rules that they'll go for</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight minutes.</v>

3203
02:11:32.511 --> 02:11:35.000
<v Speaker 2>There's no score.</v>

3205
02:11:36.290 --> 02:11:40.130
<v Speaker 2>you go into an overtime format.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you know how Ebi Works and this is</v>

3206
02:11:40.131 --> 02:11:41.720
<v Speaker 2>the biggest promotion of the whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

3207
02:11:42.080 --> 02:11:44.480
<v Speaker 2>isn't that somebody is going to go out</v>
<v Speaker 2>and compete and I got to do some</v>

3208
02:11:44.481 --> 02:11:46.640
<v Speaker 2>grappling since I've been retired,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we all,</v>

3209
02:11:46.641 --> 02:11:48.800
<v Speaker 2>we always had a clause that if you could</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat up the clock,</v>

3210
02:11:48.801 --> 02:11:50.270
<v Speaker 2>you've got to draw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody loses.</v>

3211
02:11:50.271 --> 02:11:52.880
<v Speaker 2>Whether that's a victory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes when you're in over your head,</v>

3212
02:11:52.881 --> 02:11:56.660
<v Speaker 2>you're up there wrestling for a draw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I had a vow that was out there</v>

3213
02:11:56.661 --> 02:11:59.600
<v Speaker 2>wrestling for a draw under Ebi rules,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody is going to tap.</v>

3214
02:11:59.900 --> 02:12:02.160
<v Speaker 2>So when you factor in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got jake shields taken on.</v>

3215
02:12:02.161 --> 02:12:05.210
<v Speaker 2>Chris Lidell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of those guys is going to tap when</v>

3216
02:12:05.211 --> 02:12:08.360
<v Speaker 2>you've got vinny Mongolians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe the best grappler there is right</v>

3217
02:12:08.370 --> 02:12:09.330

3218
02:12:09.770 --> 02:12:12.830

3219
02:12:12.831 --> 02:12:15.580
<v Speaker 2>tomato,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vinny Mokuleia.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know he's going to be taken on.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He hurt his neck.</v>

3223
02:12:22.251 --> 02:12:24.260
<v Speaker 2>Ronnie marks has now stepped in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He fought.</v>

<v Speaker 2>King Modena pulled out.</v>

3226
02:12:27.801 --> 02:12:29.900
<v Speaker 2>I pulled him off the card.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found out he was hurt,</v>

3227
02:12:30.470 --> 02:12:33.530
<v Speaker 2>it happened in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in his fight with Phil Davis and he's,</v>

3228
02:12:33.560 --> 02:12:36.830
<v Speaker 2>he's one of the main training partners</v>
<v Speaker 2>for Robbie lawler and he hasn't even</v>

3229
02:12:36.831 --> 02:12:39.470
<v Speaker 2>been able to train with Robbie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ran into Labario.</v>

3230
02:12:39.690 --> 02:12:40.910
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to correct me on that name for</v>

02:12:40.911 --> 02:12:41.150

3234
02:12:45.920 --> 02:12:47.750
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

3235
02:12:47.751 --> 02:12:48.200
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>King,</v>

3236
02:12:48.200 --> 02:12:49.031
<v Speaker 2>King,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mo King,</v>

3237
02:12:49.031 --> 02:12:50.390
<v Speaker 2>Mo can't move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just doesn't.</v>

3238
02:12:50.450 --> 02:12:52.160
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't want to pull out herniated</v>
<v Speaker 2>disc.</v>

3239
02:12:52.161 --> 02:12:53.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something like that.</v>

3240
02:12:53.241 --> 02:12:55.040
<v Speaker 2>I don't have all the details,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I got to hold them all.</v>

3241
02:12:55.041 --> 02:12:55.791
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this true?</v>

3242
02:12:55.791 --> 02:12:56.624
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3243
02:12:56.840 --> 02:13:00.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to come to so many guys a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucked up next.</v>

3244
02:13:00.320 --> 02:13:01.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got to pull that one.</v>

3245
02:13:01.410 --> 02:13:03.000
<v Speaker 2>Sohani marks is in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He fought you.</v>

3246
02:13:03.001 --> 02:13:04.040
<v Speaker 2>El Ramiro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Erin Simpson.</v>

3247
02:13:04.041 --> 02:13:06.290
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember those?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just signed with world series of</v>

3248
02:13:06.291 --> 02:13:09.650
<v Speaker 2>fighting a Sohani Zen against vinny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the biggest one,</v>

3249
02:13:09.651 --> 02:13:12.500
<v Speaker 2>the absolute biggest one that wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>meant to be,</v>

3250
02:13:12.501 --> 02:13:14.360
<v Speaker 2>but this is the one that's got my phone</v>
<v Speaker 2>ringing.</v>

3251
02:13:14.490 --> 02:13:17.570
<v Speaker 2>Rico Rodrigues is coming back after all</v>
<v Speaker 2>these years.</v>

3252
02:13:17.571 --> 02:13:18.930
<v Speaker 2>He's going to take on [inaudible] or</v>
<v Speaker 2>sharing,</v>

3253
02:13:18.931 --> 02:13:21.170
<v Speaker 2>or my coach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going to take on my coach and one</v>

3254
02:13:21.171 --> 02:13:22.630
<v Speaker 2>of them is going to tap into.</v>

3255
02:13:22.630 --> 02:13:25.580
<v Speaker 2>They will not leave until someone tells</v>
<v Speaker 2>slot in the UFC back in the day.</v>

3256
02:13:25.940 --> 02:13:29.240
<v Speaker 2>He's a excellent Brazilian Jujitsu</v>
<v Speaker 2>practitioner.</v>

3257
02:13:29.330 --> 02:13:30.051
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's interesting.</v>

3258
02:13:30.051 --> 02:13:31.470
<v Speaker 2>Matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rico is a bad motherfucker,</v>

3259
02:13:31.471 --> 02:13:32.760
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His ground game is very good.</v>

3260
02:13:32.790 --> 02:13:34.170
<v Speaker 2>He's fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's fantastic.</v>

3261
02:13:34.171 --> 02:13:36.270
<v Speaker 2>And then the question with Rico,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

3262
02:13:36.290 --> 02:13:39.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grappling is a gateway into mma.</v>

3263
02:13:39.960 --> 02:13:42.030
<v Speaker 2>So now that Rico's all of a sudden back</v>
<v Speaker 2>in grappling,</v>

3264
02:13:42.031 --> 02:13:45.330
<v Speaker 2>that's everybody's big question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is he coming back to mma and he's one of</v>

3265
02:13:45.331 --> 02:13:47.910
<v Speaker 2>those guys that left the sport on his</v>
<v Speaker 2>own.</v>

3266
02:13:47.940 --> 02:13:50.760
<v Speaker 2>There wasn't that a promoter when it</v>
<v Speaker 2>sign them or Dana didn't want them or</v>

3267
02:13:50.761 --> 02:13:53.310
<v Speaker 2>pride wouldn't put them under contract.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had those personal right.</v>

3268
02:13:53.311 --> 02:13:55.250
<v Speaker 2>He did whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he left on his own.</v>

3269
02:13:55.251 --> 02:13:57.450
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of the way Sean Sherk left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sean's just one day.</v>

3270
02:13:57.451 --> 02:13:59.520
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't fighting anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it took like two years until the</v>

3271
02:13:59.521 --> 02:14:03.630
<v Speaker 2>announcement came.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just makes me wonder is Ricoh coming</v>

3272
02:14:03.631 --> 02:14:03.870
<v Speaker 2>back?</v>

3273
02:14:03.870 --> 02:14:05.520
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he is.</v>

3274
02:14:05.521 --> 02:14:09.300
<v Speaker 2>It's very rare where a world champion</v>
<v Speaker 2>returns that speculation,</v>

3275
02:14:09.310 --> 02:14:10.590
<v Speaker 2>but let's see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3276
02:14:10.591 --> 02:14:13.410
<v Speaker 2>it's an interesting matchup either way</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so this is something you're doing</v>

3277
02:14:13.411 --> 02:14:16.710
<v Speaker 2>for the first time on flow combat and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you said that they have to become a</v>

3278
02:14:16.711 --> 02:14:17.850
<v Speaker 2>member,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what does that entail?</v>

3279
02:14:17.880 --> 02:14:19.260
<v Speaker 2>Giving up your email address or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something?</v>

3280
02:14:19.270 --> 02:14:19.921
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go over,</v>

3281
02:14:19.921 --> 02:14:23.220
<v Speaker 2>you register a flow combat.com.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's like 15 bucks a month.</v>

3282
02:14:23.221 --> 02:14:25.590
<v Speaker 2>14 95.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a network though.</v>

3283
02:14:25.591 --> 02:14:27.160
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of like fight pass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's.</v>

3284
02:14:27.161 --> 02:14:29.280
<v Speaker 2>There's content,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's behind the scenes.</v>

3285
02:14:29.281 --> 02:14:31.710
<v Speaker 2>It's a whole network,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're not going to buy a paper view</v>

3286
02:14:31.860 --> 02:14:34.680
<v Speaker 2>window that then shuts off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You become a member and then you can</v>

3287
02:14:34.681 --> 02:14:36.960
<v Speaker 2>turn that off the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can turn it off at the end of the</v>

3288
02:14:36.960 --> 02:14:37.950
<v Speaker 2>month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to buy for the month,</v>

3289
02:14:38.310 --> 02:14:39.870
<v Speaker 2>so you get an entire package.</v>

3290
02:14:39.870 --> 02:14:42.240
<v Speaker 2>They've got a ton of members.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a real successful guys,</v>

3291
02:14:42.600 --> 02:14:47.040
<v Speaker 2>so it's Kinda just to satisfy them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The show soul that's completely sold out</v>

3292
02:14:47.041 --> 02:14:47.741
<v Speaker 2>in Portland.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It.</v>

3293
02:14:47.741 --> 02:14:48.900
<v Speaker 2>It'll be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my mind,</v>

3294
02:14:48.901 --> 02:14:51.150
<v Speaker 2>the biggest grappling of whenever I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>done metamorris.</v>

3295
02:14:51.480 --> 02:14:53.610
<v Speaker 2>Metamorris was sold out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they had 700 tickets.</v>

3296
02:14:53.611 --> 02:14:57.240
<v Speaker 2>This is a lot more tickets sold out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only way to watch will be on flow</v>

3297
02:14:57.241 --> 02:14:59.340
<v Speaker 2>combat.com.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the guys that are participating are</v>

3298
02:14:59.341 --> 02:15:01.050
<v Speaker 2>going to have a lot of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did some grappling.</v>

3299
02:15:01.140 --> 02:15:03.600
<v Speaker 2>I just took out Michael Bisping in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a grappling match.</v>

3300
02:15:03.930 --> 02:15:08.340
<v Speaker 2>Roy Jones was on the car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was this crazy car to uh,</v>

3301
02:15:08.820 --> 02:15:12.060
<v Speaker 2>we wrestled in Arizona like the week</v>
<v Speaker 2>after he beat Anderson.</v>

3302
02:15:12.061 --> 02:15:14.300
<v Speaker 2>This just happened really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But nobody came.</v>

3303
02:15:14.301 --> 02:15:15.001
<v Speaker 2>So people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

3304
02:15:15.001 --> 02:15:16.590
<v Speaker 2>they didn't even know what was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3305
02:15:16.591 --> 02:15:19.710
<v Speaker 2>I had heard about Roy Jones boxing some</v>
<v Speaker 2>fan,</v>

3306
02:15:19.820 --> 02:15:22.260
<v Speaker 2>but fought a fan that goes five and</v>
<v Speaker 2>three and mma,</v>

3307
02:15:22.950 --> 02:15:24.930
<v Speaker 2>a two window,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an amateur boxing.</v>

3308
02:15:24.930 --> 02:15:26.670
<v Speaker 2>And he gave Roy a match.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He get Roy met.</v>

3309
02:15:26.780 --> 02:15:28.380
<v Speaker 2>Roy figured about bumble,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shut them off.</v>

3310
02:15:28.410 --> 02:15:30.270
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a boy had been knocked out</v>

3311
02:15:30.271 --> 02:15:33.450
<v Speaker 2>brutally just a couple of months ago I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think in Russia or Germany.</v>

3312
02:15:33.460 --> 02:15:34.230
<v Speaker 2>And fight was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3313
02:15:34.230 --> 02:15:35.430
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was awful.</v>

3314
02:15:35.550 --> 02:15:36.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Roy is staying busy though.</v>

3315
02:15:37.050 --> 02:15:39.840
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just hate to see them take punishment</v>

3316
02:15:39.900 --> 02:15:42.960
<v Speaker 2>because he was such a great fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So good.</v>

3317
02:15:42.961 --> 02:15:44.970
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so sad to see him now.</v>

3318
02:15:45.210 --> 02:15:47.940
<v Speaker 2>His body just looks doughy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't look good.</v>

3319
02:15:48.290 --> 02:15:49.860
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's still an excellent commentator</v>

3320
02:15:49.861 --> 02:15:50.311
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3321
02:15:50.311 --> 02:15:52.170
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not effecting the wheat talks.</v>

3322
02:15:52.230 --> 02:15:53.220
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is true.</v>

3323
02:15:53.730 --> 02:15:54.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was good to see Roy.</v>

3324
02:15:54.710 --> 02:15:55.511
<v Speaker 2>But the point was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3325
02:15:55.511 --> 02:15:57.030
<v Speaker 2>that you had a limited amount of people</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

3326
02:15:57.090 --> 02:16:00.900
<v Speaker 2>So in grappling events and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>metamorris now,</v>

3327
02:16:00.901 --> 02:16:02.820
<v Speaker 2>or at least for the last one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've got a show coming up too,</v>

3328
02:16:02.821 --> 02:16:05.460
<v Speaker 2>but the last one they had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we wrestle in front of nobody.</v>

3329
02:16:05.970 --> 02:16:08.880
<v Speaker 2>I was kind of ended that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the point is you grapplers like</v>

3330
02:16:08.881 --> 02:16:11.100
<v Speaker 2>people there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just kinda like that opposite field</v>

3331
02:16:11.101 --> 02:16:13.020
<v Speaker 2>from going into a packed arena to that</v>
<v Speaker 2>field.</v>

3332
02:16:13.320 --> 02:16:17.220
<v Speaker 2>Get more of a practice room atmosphere</v>
<v Speaker 2>at any rate with Kuma Tay,</v>

3333
02:16:17.370 --> 02:16:19.290
<v Speaker 2>now that you're correcting all my words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that what I'm trying to say?</v>

3334
02:16:19.950 --> 02:16:22.140
<v Speaker 2>This one sold out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the grapplers are going to wrestle.</v>

3335
02:16:22.141 --> 02:16:24.360
<v Speaker 2>They're going to have a roaring audience</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's a rare thing.</v>

3336
02:16:24.540 --> 02:16:25.980
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Eddie Bravo rules,</v>

3337
02:16:26.040 --> 02:16:28.980
<v Speaker 2>Eddie Bravo invitation rules are without</v>
<v Speaker 2>a doubt the best rules because they</v>

3338
02:16:28.990 --> 02:16:30.010
<v Speaker 2>force guys in a bad</v>

3339
02:16:30.250 --> 02:16:34.150
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what it is is after the fight goes to</v>

3340
02:16:34.151 --> 02:16:37.150
<v Speaker 1>the would you have eight minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight minutes after it goes through the</v>

3341
02:16:37.151 --> 02:16:40.120
<v Speaker 1>eight minute timed difference in there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a draw.</v>

3342
02:16:40.240 --> 02:16:42.580
<v Speaker 1>What happens is you put guys in bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>positions,</v>

3343
02:16:42.581 --> 02:16:45.610
<v Speaker 1>so just like in wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one guy will start on the bottom in</v>

3344
02:16:45.611 --> 02:16:47.590
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're doing with Eddie Bravo</v>

3345
02:16:47.591 --> 02:16:51.490
<v Speaker 1>rules is one guy will start on your back</v>
<v Speaker 1>or he'll start in a position called</v>

3346
02:16:51.491 --> 02:16:53.840
<v Speaker 1>spiderweb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means you're defending.</v>

3347
02:16:53.841 --> 02:16:55.960
<v Speaker 1>You got the guy in the bottoms defending</v>
<v Speaker 1>against an art bar.</v>

3348
02:16:56.110 --> 02:17:00.130
<v Speaker 1>The guy on the top is inside control</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the arm hooked and controlling the</v>

3349
02:17:00.131 --> 02:17:02.620
<v Speaker 1>leg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a bad spot to be in if you're on</v>

3350
02:17:02.621 --> 02:17:05.860
<v Speaker 1>the bottom and it's a bad spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If a guy obviously has your back.</v>

3351
02:17:05.920 --> 02:17:10.510
<v Speaker 1>So by putting guys in those situations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will allow the fight or to try to</v>

3352
02:17:10.540 --> 02:17:13.450
<v Speaker 1>work from a really bad spot to try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get a tap.</v>

3353
02:17:13.660 --> 02:17:18.190
<v Speaker 1>And then you switched places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you started on my back and you tap</v>

3354
02:17:18.191 --> 02:17:20.650
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I have at least an opportunity to</v>

3355
02:17:20.651 --> 02:17:23.680
<v Speaker 1>try to tap you and if you escaped and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wind up winning the whole thing,</v>

3356
02:17:23.830 --> 02:17:25.930
<v Speaker 1>but it could be that you escape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>escape,</v>

3357
02:17:26.170 --> 02:17:27.003
<v Speaker 1>escape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>escape,</v>

3358
02:17:27.160 --> 02:17:31.300
<v Speaker 1>and we see a lot of those matches where</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like down to the wire and if that's</v>

3359
02:17:31.301 --> 02:17:35.800
<v Speaker 1>the case then he count up the amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>time spent in control.</v>

3360
02:17:36.040 --> 02:17:40.690
<v Speaker 1>So if it takes you 10 seconds to escape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it takes me 30 seconds to escape,</v>

3361
02:17:40.720 --> 02:17:42.400
<v Speaker 1>you would win because you escaped</v>
<v Speaker 1>quicker,</v>

3362
02:17:42.490 --> 02:17:43.720
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly right.</v>

3363
02:17:43.721 --> 02:17:46.780
<v Speaker 1>It's a great way to figure out how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make grappling matches.</v>

3364
02:17:46.781 --> 02:17:47.160
<v Speaker 1>Excited.</v>

3365
02:17:47.160 --> 02:17:49.410
<v Speaker 2>I talked to Eddie before we went into</v>
<v Speaker 2>this and I said,</v>

3366
02:17:49.411 --> 02:17:50.244
<v Speaker 2>hey listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're doing.</v>

3367
02:17:50.390 --> 02:17:51.121
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're getting.</v>

3368
02:17:51.121 --> 02:17:52.920
<v Speaker 2>We can fall in the same day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's how do you want to do this?</v>

3369
02:17:52.921 --> 02:17:54.360
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's not get a battle with each other.</v>

3370
02:17:54.361 --> 02:17:54.661
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3371
02:17:54.661 --> 02:17:54.900
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

3372
02:17:54.900 --> 02:17:55.860
<v Speaker 2>Just the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

3373
02:17:55.861 --> 02:17:57.270
<v Speaker 2>I want these guys to have somewhere to</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrestle.</v>

3374
02:17:57.271 --> 02:17:58.260
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she'll do this.</v>

3375
02:17:58.530 --> 02:18:00.210
<v Speaker 2>Take my rules,</v>
<v Speaker 2>call it Abi.</v>

3376
02:18:00.240 --> 02:18:01.200
<v Speaker 2>That puts me up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he goes,</v>

3377
02:18:01.201 --> 02:18:03.510
<v Speaker 2>but do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he had a great point,</v>

3378
02:18:03.511 --> 02:18:04.470
<v Speaker 2>Joel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's what his point was.</v>

3379
02:18:04.471 --> 02:18:04.831
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3380
02:18:04.831 --> 02:18:07.260
<v Speaker 2>everybody that has a grappling event</v>
<v Speaker 2>wants to make up their own rules.</v>

3381
02:18:07.261 --> 02:18:09.870
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as an industry for the gym owners,</v>

3382
02:18:10.080 --> 02:18:12.530
<v Speaker 2>for the guys that are going into the gym</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're training everyday,</v>

3383
02:18:12.570 --> 02:18:15.660
<v Speaker 2>they need to be able to train the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>way the coach needs to be able to have a</v>

3384
02:18:15.661 --> 02:18:17.340
<v Speaker 2>stopwatch just like he does mma.</v>

3385
02:18:17.340 --> 02:18:18.870
<v Speaker 2>Five minute rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do three of them.</v>

3386
02:18:18.871 --> 02:18:21.720
<v Speaker 2>If you're a man of intertidal fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do five of you go to a basketball</v>

3387
02:18:21.721 --> 02:18:22.300
<v Speaker 2>court,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go volume.</v>

3388
02:18:22.300 --> 02:18:24.000
<v Speaker 2>It's the same universal rules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

3389
02:18:24.001 --> 02:18:27.110
<v Speaker 2>for an industry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to be all teammates,</v>

3390
02:18:27.120 --> 02:18:30.510
<v Speaker 2>all Nogi Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They need to be able to train the same</v>

3391
02:18:30.511 --> 02:18:33.030
<v Speaker 2>way so the coach can run a practice and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't have to go.</v>

3392
02:18:33.180 --> 02:18:37.370
<v Speaker 2>You guys train to fraud Vodavi over here</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you guys train them for the Ibj f</v>

3393
02:18:37.380 --> 02:18:39.060
<v Speaker 2>over here and you get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I thought,</v>

3394
02:18:39.150 --> 02:18:39.960
<v Speaker 2>Eddie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

3395
02:18:39.960 --> 02:18:43.440
<v Speaker 2>If us promoters can all get together and</v>
<v Speaker 2>unify some rules,</v>

3396
02:18:43.441 --> 02:18:46.080
<v Speaker 2>like the unified rules of MMA as an</v>
<v Speaker 2>industry,</v>

3397
02:18:46.081 --> 02:18:47.760
<v Speaker 2>the trickle down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the gyms,</v>

3398
02:18:48.420 --> 02:18:51.750
<v Speaker 2>we could get this thing figured out and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we can start to have a hybrid and</v>

3399
02:18:51.751 --> 02:18:54.120
<v Speaker 2>Eddie's rules really are quite perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3400
02:18:54.121 --> 02:18:55.770
<v Speaker 2>he calls them the most gangster rules</v>
<v Speaker 2>out there,</v>

3401
02:18:55.771 --> 02:18:57.360
<v Speaker 2>but he's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talked to Vinnie,</v>

3402
02:18:57.361 --> 02:18:58.710
<v Speaker 2>I talked to some other guys that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>talked to.</v>

3403
02:18:58.711 --> 02:19:00.600
<v Speaker 2>I talked to Sala Rivera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going,</v>

3404
02:19:00.601 --> 02:19:01.650
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's Ebi.</v>

3405
02:19:01.680 --> 02:19:04.230
<v Speaker 2>That's how you find if you want to live</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best is you got to go.</v>

3406
02:19:04.231 --> 02:19:05.064
<v Speaker 2>Ebi Rules.</v>

3407
02:19:05.090 --> 02:19:07.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really is the best and it stops all</v>

3408
02:19:07.131 --> 02:19:09.020
<v Speaker 1>these draws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These draws are brutal.</v>

3409
02:19:09.040 --> 02:19:13.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean you have that a polaris match.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got all these amazing matchups and</v>

3410
02:19:13.231 --> 02:19:16.780
<v Speaker 1>then Gary Tonin verses Paul Harris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>draw other.</v>

3411
02:19:16.830 --> 02:19:18.010
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You haven't draws.</v>

3412
02:19:18.080 --> 02:19:19.280
<v Speaker 1>Everything is a draw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>draw,</v>

3413
02:19:19.281 --> 02:19:20.114
<v Speaker 1>draw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>draw.</v>

3414
02:19:20.270 --> 02:19:22.250
<v Speaker 1>You can have people get excited about</v>
<v Speaker 1>draws.</v>

3415
02:19:22.251 --> 02:19:24.170
<v Speaker 1>They don't get excited about draws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not fun.</v>

3416
02:19:24.270 --> 02:19:26.340
<v Speaker 2>I talked to her about that and how it</v>
<v Speaker 2>goes.</v>

3417
02:19:26.341 --> 02:19:26.990
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do have.</v>

3418
02:19:26.990 --> 02:19:28.760
<v Speaker 2>I do have one problem with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

3419
02:19:28.770 --> 02:19:30.800
<v Speaker 2>I guys are more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can get them to,</v>

3420
02:19:30.860 --> 02:19:33.080
<v Speaker 2>to wrestle more guys kinda like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that clause,</v>

3421
02:19:33.081 --> 02:19:35.090
<v Speaker 2>and you got to have a time limit</v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere and we don't quite know how to</v>

3422
02:19:35.091 --> 02:19:36.140
<v Speaker 2>figure out the overtime yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

3423
02:19:36.141 --> 02:19:38.900
<v Speaker 2>but the problem I'm running into is I</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to champion.</v>

3424
02:19:39.020 --> 02:19:41.130
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's hard to build a division and to</v>

3425
02:19:41.330 --> 02:19:44.720
<v Speaker 2>decide who's the next number one</v>
<v Speaker 2>contender if you don't have an</v>

3426
02:19:44.721 --> 02:19:47.480
<v Speaker 2>architecture in place where a guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>advances through a bracket,</v>

3427
02:19:47.481 --> 02:19:49.100
<v Speaker 2>if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to have.</v>

3428
02:19:49.400 --> 02:19:50.330
<v Speaker 2>You have to have a winter,</v>

3429
02:19:50.510 --> 02:19:51.343
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3430
02:19:51.370 --> 02:19:53.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a giant issue with,</v>

3431
02:19:53.451 --> 02:19:55.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody else's rule set.</v>

3432
02:19:55.191 --> 02:19:59.270
<v Speaker 1>I just think that if you look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>submission grappling and especially</v>

3433
02:19:59.271 --> 02:20:03.020
<v Speaker 1>people that have a problem with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote unquote violence of MMA,</v>

3434
02:20:03.320 --> 02:20:06.110
<v Speaker 1>the submission aspect of it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's beautiful to watch.</v>

3435
02:20:06.111 --> 02:20:08.600
<v Speaker 1>It's exciting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's dynamic and you watch someone get</v>

3436
02:20:08.601 --> 02:20:09.950
<v Speaker 1>choked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

3437
02:20:10.130 --> 02:20:10.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3438
02:20:10.640 --> 02:20:12.560
<v Speaker 1>it's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fun.</v>

3439
02:20:12.770 --> 02:20:15.350
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an exciting part of martial arts</v>

3440
02:20:15.770 --> 02:20:18.980
<v Speaker 1>and it's something that guys can do when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they retire from fighting.</v>

3441
02:20:19.220 --> 02:20:22.280
<v Speaker 1>It's something that a lot of people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to get involved in mma,</v>

3442
02:20:22.310 --> 02:20:26.940
<v Speaker 1>but guys like the Mendez brothers or</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a Gary Turner,</v>

3443
02:20:27.030 --> 02:20:29.090
<v Speaker 1>he's actually probably going to do mma</v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually,</v>

3444
02:20:29.091 --> 02:20:33.170
<v Speaker 1>but all these super talented grapplers</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gives them an opportunity to show</v>

3445
02:20:33.171 --> 02:20:33.810
<v Speaker 1>their stuff.</v>

3446
02:20:33.810 --> 02:20:34.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly.</v>

3447
02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:36.400
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know who Tony is,</v>

3448
02:20:36.430 --> 02:20:37.061
<v Speaker 2>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3449
02:20:37.061 --> 02:20:39.110
<v Speaker 2>he's so excited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's crazy.</v>

3450
02:20:39.180 --> 02:20:39.970
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Turn it on.</v>

3451
02:20:39.970 --> 02:20:40.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's.</v>

3452
02:20:40.600 --> 02:20:41.291
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just.</v>

3453
02:20:41.291 --> 02:20:43.990
<v Speaker 2>He's fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you've got so many guys like this.</v>

3454
02:20:44.020 --> 02:20:46.180
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you dangle that big carrot and all of</v>

3455
02:20:46.181 --> 02:20:48.880
<v Speaker 2>a sudden you're just signing the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>popular and the most famous guys.</v>

3456
02:20:48.881 --> 02:20:51.280
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really liked the Olympic model or even</v>

3457
02:20:51.281 --> 02:20:53.800
<v Speaker 2>the NCAA model.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The best guy always steps forward,</v>

3458
02:20:53.801 --> 02:20:55.930
<v Speaker 2>but the best guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times it has a hard time</v>

3459
02:20:55.931 --> 02:20:57.910
<v Speaker 2>getting a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Promoters want guys that are going to</v>

3460
02:20:57.911 --> 02:20:59.410
<v Speaker 2>sell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3461
02:20:59.740 --> 02:21:01.660
<v Speaker 2>let's put that on hold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're a good promoter,</v>

3462
02:21:01.840 --> 02:21:03.900
<v Speaker 2>you'll figure out how to sell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just will.</v>

3463
02:21:03.910 --> 02:21:05.100
<v Speaker 2>If you're a promoter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>use Dana's.</v>

3464
02:21:05.290 --> 02:21:08.420
<v Speaker 2>You'll bring in the bells and whistles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's give everybody a chance the</v>

3465
02:21:08.421 --> 02:21:10.000
<v Speaker 2>same way the Olympics Games does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3466
02:21:10.001 --> 02:21:13.030
<v Speaker 2>lets anybody that thinks they're best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Raise your hand.</v>

3467
02:21:13.031 --> 02:21:14.640
<v Speaker 2>Let's get an error figured out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we're gonna.</v>

3468
02:21:14.660 --> 02:21:16.120
<v Speaker 2>Have to have a lot of events.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're gonna have to work,</v>

3469
02:21:16.270 --> 02:21:18.460
<v Speaker 2>but let's get a system in place and</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's figure it out.</v>

3470
02:21:19.030 --> 02:21:20.020
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He fell on his acl as acl.</v>

3483
02:21:56.180 --> 02:21:59.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was doing a lip sync competition.</v>

3484
02:21:59.151 --> 02:22:01.730
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And apparently he got up,</v>

3485
02:22:01.780 --> 02:22:06.320
<v Speaker 1>he gutted it out and he tried to keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>going and they tipped over sideways and</v>

3486
02:22:06.321 --> 02:22:07.670

<v Speaker 1>It's hilarious.</v>

<v Speaker 1>his knee out.</v>

3490
02:22:12.951 --> 02:22:14.000

<v Speaker 1>That jumped that.</v>

3492
02:22:16.251 --> 02:22:19.610
<v Speaker 1>He does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he does that,</v>

3493
02:22:19.640 --> 02:22:21.560
<v Speaker 1>he leaps in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He blew his acl out.</v>

3494
02:22:21.620 --> 02:22:23.300
<v Speaker 1>Doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wants to watch them live out of the</v>

<v Speaker 2>grappling competition.</v>

3512
02:23:00.930 --> 02:23:03.420

<v Speaker 2>bring these guys.</v>

3513
02:23:03.540 --> 02:23:05.820
<v Speaker 2>They're not sending their best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're boring,</v>

3514
02:23:05.850 --> 02:23:08.040
<v Speaker 2>they're dull,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not risk takers.</v>

3515
02:23:08.100 --> 02:23:12.180
<v Speaker 2>I am going to change all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No more 20 minute matches where it can</v>
