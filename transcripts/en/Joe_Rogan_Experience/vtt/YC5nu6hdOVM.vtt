2
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.840
<v Speaker 1>Party people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome.</v>

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.780
<v Speaker 1>Welcome once again to the Joe Rogan </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience podcast.</v>

4
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.900
<v Speaker 1>This episode is brought to you by </v>
<v Speaker 1>stamps.com</v>

5
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.290
<v Speaker 1>stamps.com.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you've ever gone to desk dot TV and </v>

6
00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:19.110
<v Speaker 1>ordered one of those cute little kitty </v>
<v Speaker 1>cat tee shirts,</v>

7
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.950
<v Speaker 1>guess how they get to you bitches?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get to you through stamps.com</v>

8
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.280
<v Speaker 1>because that's what brian red band uses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can buy and print official US </v>

9
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.860
<v Speaker 1>postage for any letter or package using </v>
<v Speaker 1>your own computer and printer and unlike</v>

10
00:00:31.861 --> 00:00:34.770
<v Speaker 1>the post office stamps.com</v>
<v Speaker 1>never closes.</v>

11
00:00:34.771 --> 00:00:39.630
<v Speaker 1>You can get posted whenever you need it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty four slash seven to a great asset</v>

12
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.130
<v Speaker 1>for small businesses</v>

13
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.190
<v Speaker 2>and not only it can eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can buy these stamps so it looks </v>

14
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.000
<v Speaker 2>just like a stamp or you could just buy </v>
<v Speaker 2>it like on a.</v>

15
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.550
<v Speaker 2>It just prints it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like if you have an envelope,</v>

16
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.930
<v Speaker 2>just an envelope in your printer and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>prints the stamp right on the,</v>

17
00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.990
<v Speaker 2>on the envelope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so fucking easy.</v>

18
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.070
<v Speaker 2>Like I was scared to use this for awhile</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I first started shipping tee shirts</v>

19
00:00:59.071 --> 00:01:04.071
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would actually go to the post office </v>

20
00:01:04.071 --> 00:01:05.781
<v Speaker 2>and sit there for like an hour with </v>
<v Speaker 2>these boxes where this old lady that </v>

21
00:01:05.781 --> 00:01:08.610
<v Speaker 2>sits there puts a stamp on it and go </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways it and it took forever.</v>

22
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.630
<v Speaker 2>So I finally did this and man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will never ever go to that post office</v>

23
00:01:12.631 --> 00:01:13.020
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

24
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:14.280
<v Speaker 1>Post offices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brutal.</v>

25
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.240
<v Speaker 1>There's a reason why they fucking shoot </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other every now and again.</v>

26
00:01:18.241 --> 00:01:20.670
<v Speaker 1>They just fucking inbox outbox and bug.</v>

27
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.660
<v Speaker 2>I think the post office stamps.com,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was like super fast,</v>

28
00:01:27.661 --> 00:01:28.460
<v Speaker 2>like why are they saying.</v>

29
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.380
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me that the post office is </v>
<v Speaker 1>on its way out.</v>

30
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.580
<v Speaker 1>The ups store is way fucking easier to </v>
<v Speaker 1>use and something like stamps.com.</v>

31
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.820
<v Speaker 1>If you have a small business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why you would be crazy to use anything </v>

32
00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.381
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's the last thing you ever want </v>

33
00:01:45.381 --> 00:01:49.641
<v Speaker 1>to do is take a bunch of fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>packages to the post office with </v>

34
00:01:49.641 --> 00:01:50.310
<v Speaker 1>stamps.com.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to do that shit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You can do it whenever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty four hours a day.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's convenient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the way you want it.</v>

37
00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.290

<v Speaker 1>You don't have to go in line and have to</v>

39
00:02:00.811 --> 00:02:02.940
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to deal with nobody else.</v>

40
00:02:02.941 --> 00:02:04.470
<v Speaker 1>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a beautiful thing.</v>

41
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.400
<v Speaker 1>If you use the Promo Code J R,</v>
<v Speaker 1>e,</v>

42
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.180
<v Speaker 1>m,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look up,</v>

43
00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.990
<v Speaker 1>if you go to stamps.com,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a little microphone in the upper</v>

44
00:02:12.991 --> 00:02:17.991
<v Speaker 1>right hand corner and if you go to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>microphone I said Adam Carolla </v>

45
00:02:17.991 --> 00:02:17.991
<v Speaker 1>microphone.</v>

46
00:02:17.991 --> 00:02:22.130
<v Speaker 1>It's an old school one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris rock from one of his specials and </v>

47
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.881
<v Speaker 1>Lenny Bruce too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody ever really used those </v>

48
00:02:25.881 --> 00:02:25.881
<v Speaker 1>microphones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you want to look slick,</v>

49
00:02:25.881 --> 00:02:26.490
<v Speaker 1>you'd get one of those microphones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

50
00:02:26.491 --> 00:02:30.300
<v Speaker 1>those microphones are pieces of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would sound like fucking dog shit.</v>

51
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.360
<v Speaker 1>If you ever did a comedy show and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>had one of those microphones,</v>

52
00:02:33.361 --> 00:02:36.660
<v Speaker 1>everybody wants to use those microphones</v>
<v Speaker 1>for like their fucking head shots,</v>

53
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.630
<v Speaker 1>but if you were at a concert and you had</v>
<v Speaker 1>that microphone,</v>

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.330
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't even sound that good.</v>

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:39.280
<v Speaker 1>you stopped by to say hi at the Wilbur </v>
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>

235
00:10:39.281 --> 00:10:39.940
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was cool.</v>

236
00:10:39.941 --> 00:10:43.710
<v Speaker 1>You came down and risk your life at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>end of the world was over 24 years.</v>

237
00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:44.310
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>You understand?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hope I had to do it.</v>

239
00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:51.020
<v Speaker 4>Then you gave me a shout on it had </v>
<v Speaker 4>already left because my girl came by </v>

240
00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:53.951
<v Speaker 4>with the car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had to hustle out there and I felt </v>

241
00:10:53.951 --> 00:10:53.951
<v Speaker 4>like an ass.</v>

242
00:10:53.951 --> 00:10:53.951
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

243
00:10:53.951 --> 00:10:53.951
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no worries man.</v>

244
00:10:53.951 --> 00:10:54.280
<v Speaker 1>It was cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was cool seeing it was fun.</v>

245
00:10:54.281 --> 00:10:55.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was uh,</v>

246
00:10:55.480 --> 00:11:00.480
<v Speaker 1>one of the weirdest events that I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever done because we don't usually do </v>

247
00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:01.840
<v Speaker 1>like theaters in Hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I'm in Hollywood,</v>

248
00:11:01.841 --> 00:11:06.070
<v Speaker 1>I do like the Improv or I usually do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pasadena usually worked the ice house,</v>

249
00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:11.310
<v Speaker 1>so to do like the wiltern it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was one of those big events that all </v>

250
00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:13.720
<v Speaker 1>these agents come down to that you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

251
00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:16.180
<v Speaker 1>And I remember there was a point during </v>
<v Speaker 1>the show,</v>

252
00:11:16.181 --> 00:11:18.800
<v Speaker 1>like where it had already started and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>were in the green room.</v>

253
00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:22.510
<v Speaker 1>It was you and me and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think stan home was back there too,</v>

254
00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:25.570
<v Speaker 1>like two guys that I knew and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody else I didn't know.</v>

255
00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.840
<v Speaker 1>There's all these agents and they're all</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating my</v>

256
00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:30.310
<v Speaker 4>and they sit there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

257
00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:33.760
<v Speaker 4>picking at the stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I actually feel bad because,</v>

258
00:11:33.761 --> 00:11:34.230
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

259
00:11:34.231 --> 00:11:39.231
<v Speaker 4>I know my core group of people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then there's people that I know that </v>

260
00:11:39.231 --> 00:11:40.210
<v Speaker 4>I've met before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's just like I don't see you.</v>

261
00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:45.370
<v Speaker 4>I see you every couple of years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I feel I actually feel bad sometimes.</v>

262
00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:51.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't ever feel bad when they all just</v>
<v Speaker 1>show up in the green room and just have </v>

263
00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:54.931
<v Speaker 1>conversations and like this is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>strange because it was people from all </v>

264
00:11:54.931 --> 00:11:54.931
<v Speaker 1>sorts</v>

265
00:11:54.931 --> 00:11:56.650
<v Speaker 5>of different agencies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the honey honey is bands,</v>

266
00:11:56.830 --> 00:12:01.830
<v Speaker 5>people and all these other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just like to go in there and I </v>

267
00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:01.830
<v Speaker 5>couldn't get.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was ridiculous.</v>

268
00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:01.830
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was packed.</v>

269
00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:02.380
<v Speaker 5>I wasn't allowed in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You would,</v>

270
00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:03.870

<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

271

<v Speaker 5>You're not allowed to that bro.</v>

272
00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:10.770
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Joey Diaz didn't allow you to come over </v>

273
00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:10.770
<v Speaker 5>here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Come on.</v>

274
00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:13.240
<v Speaker 5>He's tired of your bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the place I would love to play,</v>

275
00:12:13.241 --> 00:12:14.540
<v Speaker 5>just because I've seen so many,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

276
00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:16.900
<v Speaker 5>I've seen a lot of great bands there and</v>
<v Speaker 5>really good shows.</v>

277
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:20.560
<v Speaker 5>I only got to see one of the show there </v>
<v Speaker 5>before I saw,</v>

278
00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:21.470
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

279
00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:26.620
<v Speaker 5>Robert Schimmel who was doing show back </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the day for Tom Lucas who was doing a</v>

280
00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:28.090
<v Speaker 5>show at the wiltern.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

281
00:12:28.091 --> 00:12:29.140
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what a cool theater.</v>

282
00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:32.620
<v Speaker 5>But when we decided Stan hope and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>many,</v>

283
00:12:32.621 --> 00:12:37.621
<v Speaker 5>many years ago decided that we were </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to do a show on December 24th </v>

284
00:12:37.621 --> 00:12:37.621
<v Speaker 5>2012.</v>

285
00:12:37.621 --> 00:12:38.820
<v Speaker 5>So if the end of the world really did </v>
<v Speaker 5>end,</v>

286
00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:41.590
<v Speaker 5>like everybody thought it was going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>the Mayan apocalypse,</v>

287
00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:43.510
<v Speaker 5>we would at least be doing a show </v>
<v Speaker 5>together.</v>

288
00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:44.200
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:14.060
<v Speaker 1>We want to know what a girl said before.</v>

351
00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:19.950
<v Speaker 2>What was he on a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you might get some ice cream over </v>

352
00:15:20.821 --> 00:15:25.350
<v Speaker 2>there and just starts throwing punches </v>
<v Speaker 2>or it was there,</v>

353
00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:31.040
<v Speaker 2>so there was some sort of button pushing</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would guess that went on and she </v>

354
00:15:35.581 --> 00:15:40.581
<v Speaker 2>didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She thought it was only going to go </v>

355
00:15:40.581 --> 00:15:40.581
<v Speaker 2>halfway up the building and it went to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the roof.</v>

356
00:15:40.581 --> 00:15:40.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right away when he was driving to.</v>

357
00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:45.930
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like when the dudes go to the </v>

358
00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:48.171
<v Speaker 2>gym,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to the zoo and they start fucking </v>

359
00:15:48.171 --> 00:15:50.061
<v Speaker 2>with some animal and they think it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>joke and then all of a sudden I think </v>

360
00:15:50.061 --> 00:15:50.061
<v Speaker 2>reaches through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

361
00:15:50.061 --> 00:15:50.061
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is real.</v>

362
00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:55.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when a lady gets too close to the </v>

363
00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:55.190
<v Speaker 1>polar bear thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever see that video?</v>

364
00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:57.540
<v Speaker 1>The polar bear has a hold of her leg </v>
<v Speaker 1>with its teeth,</v>

365
00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:01.350
<v Speaker 1>has trying to pull her through the cage </v>
<v Speaker 1>and she's screaming,</v>

366
00:16:01.351 --> 00:16:03.390
<v Speaker 1>her leg snapped or femur snapped.</v>

367
00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:06.920
<v Speaker 2>You know what's amazing about that is if</v>
<v Speaker 2>people didn't get there in time,</v>

368
00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:12.220
<v Speaker 2>he eventually would have had the power </v>
<v Speaker 2>in his back and his neck to pull that </v>

369
00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:12.220
<v Speaker 2>woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

370
00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:12.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would have chewed her apart.</v>

371
00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:18.840
<v Speaker 1>He woulda Woulda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>woulda got whatever he could get out of </v>

372
00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:20.060
<v Speaker 1>that one piece of leg and then he would </v>
<v Speaker 1>have reached through and pull.</v>

373
00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:25.250
<v Speaker 2>She would have been eating her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The worst of the best thing that could </v>

374
00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:25.950
<v Speaker 2>happen when a polar bear comes at you is</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not.</v>

375
00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:28.740
<v Speaker 2>They're not in a cage because at least </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's over quick,</v>

376
00:16:28.741 --> 00:16:30.270
<v Speaker 2>but if they were in a cage and there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>no one around,</v>

377
00:16:30.271 --> 00:16:35.271
<v Speaker 2>you're slowly going to get eaten to </v>
<v Speaker 2>death because it's going to hold you </v>

378
00:16:35.271 --> 00:16:37.401
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which I would stick a fucking artery </v>

379
00:16:37.401 --> 00:16:37.990
<v Speaker 2>right in his mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That one in effect.</v>

380
00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:39.160
<v Speaker 2>Go ahead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take a champ.</v>

381
00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:44.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd probably be bleed out from the </v>

382
00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:44.950
<v Speaker 1>legs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The legs are good.</v>

383
00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:46.130
<v Speaker 1>Spot to get bit by a polar bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something you're not gonna last long,</v>

384
00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:48.770
<v Speaker 1>especially inner thigh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you don't.</v>

385
00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:52.470
<v Speaker 1>Is this the one of the lady?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Jesus Christ,</v>

386
00:16:52.471 --> 00:16:56.690
<v Speaker 1>this fucking stupid lady,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy person decides to get close enough</v>

387
00:16:56.691 --> 00:17:01.160
<v Speaker 1>to a fucking polar bear that I could </v>
<v Speaker 1>reach out and grab a hold of him.</v>

388
00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:10.670
<v Speaker 3>I was thoroughly involved in binkies </v>
<v Speaker 3>enormous choice.</v>

389
00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:15.820
<v Speaker 3>Take off your belt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Binky.</v>

390
00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:21.380
<v Speaker 3>I nearly $1,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>is 29 year old Cathryn Warburton from </v>

391
00:17:22.271 --> 00:17:27.271
<v Speaker 3>Sydney.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I that looks 50 fucking leg is marble.</v>

392
00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:32.650
<v Speaker 2>There's a video when we played it on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>show anymore.</v>

393
00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:37.230
<v Speaker 3>Pause around her legs and was chewing </v>
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

394
00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:42.240
<v Speaker 3>Catherine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get jumped over to low lying barricades,</v>

395
00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:45.480
<v Speaker 3>hoping to get a closeup photo of banking</v>
<v Speaker 3>in his cage.</v>

396
00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:48.180
<v Speaker 3>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>biggie got the closeout.</v>

397
00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:55.970
<v Speaker 6>He has plunged his canines directly into</v>
<v Speaker 6>Catherine's three d animated fake </v>

398
00:17:57.270 --> 00:18:01.410
<v Speaker 6>version of wider apart than in other </v>
<v Speaker 6>bears.</v>

399
00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:05.210
<v Speaker 6>That extra space allows them to grasp </v>
<v Speaker 6>and tear too.</v>

400
00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:08.850
<v Speaker 6>They can kill a walrus.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Other teams and they only kill.</v>

401
00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:11.370
<v Speaker 6>It's the difference between polar bears </v>
<v Speaker 6>and grizzlies.</v>

402
00:18:11.371 --> 00:18:14.220
<v Speaker 6>They don't eat any vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's no plants where they live.</v>

403
00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:17.400
<v Speaker 6>Medical doctor knows there is not much </v>
<v Speaker 6>time left.</v>

404
00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:22.260
<v Speaker 6>Knowing the anatomy of a throw that </v>
<v Speaker 6>camera at the lower extremities.</v>

405
00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:24.330
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's not good enough.</v>

406
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:29.390
<v Speaker 6>The best thing you could do there </v>
<v Speaker 6>honestly is a either stabbing the eyes </v>

407
00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:32.820
<v Speaker 6>or a grab a belt and wrap it around its </v>
<v Speaker 6>neck and choke and unconscious,</v>

408
00:18:32.821 --> 00:18:37.821
<v Speaker 6>but you'd have to get close enough to </v>
<v Speaker 6>put your arms around its neck and hope </v>

409
00:18:37.821 --> 00:18:39.030
<v Speaker 6>it doesn't let go and snap your arms as </v>
<v Speaker 6>you're doing that.</v>

410
00:18:39.031 --> 00:18:40.170
<v Speaker 6>Two words.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Zoom button.</v>

411
00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:51.700
<v Speaker 6>There's a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She probably got a really cheap two </v>

412
00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:51.700
<v Speaker 6>megapixel Jamey.</v>

413
00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:55.650
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would've loved to have seen how quick </v>

414
00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:55.650
<v Speaker 5>that thing close the distance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the closing speed of that,</v>

415
00:18:55.650 --> 00:19:00.630
<v Speaker 5>like a cornerback.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can make up distance with the wide </v>

416
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:01.630
<v Speaker 5>receiver and the whatever thinks it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>what dudes wide open and all of a sudden</v>

417
00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:03.790
<v Speaker 5>gets picked off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's like,</v>

418
00:19:03.791 --> 00:19:04.940
<v Speaker 5>what just happened?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

419
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.660
<v Speaker 5>what's over there?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's your leg is in its mouth.</v>

420
00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:09.850
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever seen how fast a bear can </v>
<v Speaker 5>run up a tree?</v>

421
00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:11.110
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's sick.</v>

422
00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:12.460
<v Speaker 6>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's this.</v>

423
00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:14.680
<v Speaker 6>There's a video and see if he could find</v>
<v Speaker 6>this.</v>

424
00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:17.120
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

426
00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:25.160
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jesus Christ just left under the </v>

427
00:19:25.711 --> 00:19:29.230
<v Speaker 5>surface.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Only a rubber ring distracts it from its</v>

428
00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.890
<v Speaker 5>on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

433
00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:51.880
<v Speaker 5>the trousers and pulled her back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was just born with that weapon,</v>

434
00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:56.130
<v Speaker 5>getting little plunger.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But this was far from a game.</v>

435
00:19:56.310 --> 00:20:01.310
<v Speaker 5>Witnesses looked on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A six keepers distracted the animals </v>

<v Speaker 6>Get the frozen meat.</v>

441
00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:17.270
<v Speaker 6>There's a video of a couple guys </v>
<v Speaker 6>hunting.</v>

442
00:20:17.271 --> 00:20:20.120
<v Speaker 6>They're in a hunting blind and they're </v>
<v Speaker 6>sitting there.</v>

<v Speaker 6>They're hunting for bears and this </v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking bear runs up the tree beside </v>

<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

467
00:21:29.881 --> 00:21:32.820
<v Speaker 6>I think he's probably laughing because </v>
<v Speaker 6>he's terrified to.</v>

468
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:33.620
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that's.</v>

469
00:21:33.621 --> 00:21:38.621
<v Speaker 6>I think he's scared shitless and they'll</v>
<v Speaker 6>watch the bears right beside him.</v>

470
00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:44.040
<v Speaker 6>He gets trying to get the camera on it.</v>

487
00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:33.100
<v Speaker 6>He waits for the bear.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Go to go back to the barrel.</v>

<v Speaker 6>the barrel is filled with food.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They bait these bands.</v>

495
00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:59.770
<v Speaker 4>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think there's no native American </v>

496
00:22:59.770 --> 00:22:59.770
<v Speaker 4>that would have done that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

497
00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:00.170
<v Speaker 4>they wouldn't have been dumb enough to </v>
<v Speaker 4>let it happen.</v>

498
00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:01.580
<v Speaker 4>They would have had some great code </v>
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>

499
00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:04.520
<v Speaker 4>Used to have some ceremony when they </v>
<v Speaker 4>killed a bear because a bear was so much</v>

500
00:23:04.521 --> 00:23:09.521
<v Speaker 4>like a human,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it's mannerisms and that type of </v>

501
00:23:09.521 --> 00:23:09.521
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really.</v>

502
00:23:09.521 --> 00:23:09.910
<v Speaker 4>I overheard it in a bar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There you go.</v>

503
00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:11.810
<v Speaker 4>Could be true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Could be true.</v>

504
00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:14.400
<v Speaker 4>Could not be true that we were on a </v>
<v Speaker 4>podcast yesterday.</v>

505
00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:16.880
<v Speaker 4>We talked about what you want to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>down from the tree,</v>

506
00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:21.940
<v Speaker 4>so you got to shoot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess that's what it is because what </v>

507
00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:22.580
<v Speaker 4>if it comes back this time and these on </v>
<v Speaker 4>the bottom?</v>

508
00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:24.220
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just runs out of them.</v>

509
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.540
<v Speaker 4>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Strike that smart move.</v>

510
00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:31.600
<v Speaker 4>Smart move and he's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was there for that in the first </v>

511
00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:31.600
<v Speaker 4>place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

512
00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:31.670
<v Speaker 4>that's the reason why the bear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was there a reason why he was there?</v>

513
00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:34.930
<v Speaker 4>Spare of the bear did bear spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm.</v>

514
00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:37.940
<v Speaker 4>I'm really putting literally putting </v>
<v Speaker 4>human traits on disparate stupid.</v>

515
00:23:37.941 --> 00:23:42.941
<v Speaker 4>I think the die in the woods to dumb the</v>
<v Speaker 4>bears is too dumb to figure out shit,</v>

516
00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:46.310
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a good guy.</v>

517
00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:47.890
<v Speaker 2>We came up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he could've shot him.</v>

518
00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:52.920
<v Speaker 2>He didn't get a shuttle down and he goes</v>
<v Speaker 2>over to his caddy and some of the </v>

519
00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:55.700
<v Speaker 2>fucking Arrow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>An Arrow from 20 yards.</v>

520
00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:58.060
<v Speaker 2>Can you imagine somebody shot him with </v>
<v Speaker 2>an Arrow?</v>

521
00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:00.200
<v Speaker 2>Can imagine what it would have been if </v>
<v Speaker 2>he got the right Sheree,</v>

522
00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:05.260
<v Speaker 2>if he did have the right to imagine will</v>
<v Speaker 2>come up and just grab you fucked up.</v>

523
00:24:06.141 --> 00:24:08.960
<v Speaker 2>Close animals come to victory sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's just the one little thing.</v>

524
00:24:08.961 --> 00:24:09.260
<v Speaker 2>They just</v>

525
00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:11.760
<v Speaker 1>the dot that chromosome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they missing that dumb.</v>

526
00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:15.370
<v Speaker 1>That's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like the fastest I've ever seen a</v>

527
00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:20.380
<v Speaker 1>bear climate tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know they could get up a tree </v>

528
00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:20.380
<v Speaker 1>that fell.</v>

529
00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:20.380
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do.</v>

530
00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:23.440
<v Speaker 2>Your best bet is you have to get up so </v>
<v Speaker 2>high that they're nervous that I guess </v>

531
00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:25.400
<v Speaker 2>that the tree is going to break,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you're up there.</v>

532
00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:30.890
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it depends on what bear to grizzlies </v>

533
00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:30.890
<v Speaker 2>don't climb trees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never been bear hunting.</v>

534
00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:30.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know where.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you?</v>

535
00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:32.660
<v Speaker 2>What are the words come from?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes like,</v>

536
00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:34.250
<v Speaker 2>what am I saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shut up.</v>

537
00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:40.600
<v Speaker 2>Got To do is I've watched this on </v>
<v Speaker 2>discovery from an l shaped couch.</v>

538
00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:45.020
<v Speaker 2>Let me tell you what to do now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A black bear,</v>

539
00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:50.110
<v Speaker 2>black bear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what you got to start breaking </v>

540
00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:50.110
<v Speaker 2>it down.</v>

541
00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:53.720
<v Speaker 1>Bears are more likely to climb trees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They climb trees all the time.</v>

542
00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:56.900
<v Speaker 1>Grizzlies apparently don't climb trees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you</v>

543
00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:00.240
<v Speaker 2>never.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My plane crashed.</v>

544
00:25:00.241 --> 00:25:03.960
<v Speaker 2>If I've ever used that information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you never know the plane crash.</v>

545
00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:07.410
<v Speaker 2>You gotta do what you gotTa do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bill due to plaintiff starts going down.</v>

546
00:25:07.411 --> 00:25:09.480
<v Speaker 2>The first thing I'm doing is taking the </v>
<v Speaker 2>seatbelt off.</v>

547
00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:12.690
<v Speaker 2>Really don't want to survive this </v>
<v Speaker 2>covered in jet fuel.</v>

548
00:25:12.691 --> 00:25:14.730
<v Speaker 2>Coming out with my slacks melted to my </v>
<v Speaker 2>legs.</v>

549
00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:18.030
<v Speaker 2>I get start knocking on the fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck next to me.</v>

550
00:25:18.031 --> 00:25:20.550
<v Speaker 2>Just kill me ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a great one.</v>

551
00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:22.560
<v Speaker 2>I had a great life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

552
00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:23.520
<v Speaker 2>Why not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

553
00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:24.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why not sober?</v>

554
00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:27.300
<v Speaker 1>So you were talking about the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were talking about the grid,</v>

555
00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:28.720
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Greek thing about Jimmy,</v>

556
00:25:28.721 --> 00:25:31.240
<v Speaker 1>the Greek for folks who don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy,</v>

557
00:25:31.241 --> 00:25:33.490
<v Speaker 1>the Greek was a famous football.</v>

558
00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:37.760
<v Speaker 2>The commentator would do the odds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

559
00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:41.160
<v Speaker 2>Take the bears laying three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the seventies where you could,</v>

560
00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:43.350
<v Speaker 2>you allowed to talk about betting </v>
<v Speaker 2>gambling?</v>

561
00:25:43.351 --> 00:25:45.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For the NFL was like,</v>

562
00:25:45.031 --> 00:25:46.980
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are we doing it when men were men</v>

563
00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:52.920
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had the gall to insinuate that there </v>

564
00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:57.031
<v Speaker 1>might've been some benefit to these </v>
<v Speaker 1>African American people breeding in </v>

565
00:25:57.031 --> 00:25:57.210
<v Speaker 1>slaves and that</v>

566
00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:02.740
<v Speaker 2>he was doing what I just did with bears </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was having a drink in a </v>

567
00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:03.980
<v Speaker 2>restaurant and somebody filmed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like one of the original,</v>

568
00:26:03.981 --> 00:26:05.360
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what it was?</v>

569
00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:06.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>

570
00:26:06.051 --> 00:26:08.390
<v Speaker 2>he's like in a restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was an interview.</v>

571
00:26:08.550 --> 00:26:10.170
<v Speaker 2>Now he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe he's in like,</v>

572
00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:15.450
<v Speaker 2>I don't fucking remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like in an interview and he's </v>

573
00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:15.800
<v Speaker 2>like eating potato skins and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>

574
00:26:15.801 --> 00:26:17.230
<v Speaker 2>what happened to all the white running </v>
<v Speaker 2>back?</v>

575
00:26:17.231 --> 00:26:18.650
<v Speaker 2>So he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the theory,</v>

576
00:26:18.651 --> 00:26:19.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in a bar,</v>

577
00:26:19.431 --> 00:26:21.410
<v Speaker 2>somebody asked a question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna answer it.</v>

578
00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:26.650
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to get rid of him anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying what he said is 100 </v>

579
00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:30.071
<v Speaker 2>percent true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like they wanted to get rid of </v>

580
00:26:30.071 --> 00:26:33.491
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to get rid of that guy </v>

581
00:26:33.491 --> 00:26:33.491

00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:37.090
<v Speaker 2>a local newscast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was so many videos.</v>

584
00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:38.270
<v Speaker 2>There was a girl back then called Jane </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy,</v>

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:43.840
<v Speaker 2>gorgeous woman and some sex tape came </v>
<v Speaker 2>out about her and one of the first ones </v>

586

<v Speaker 2>and it just went around</v>

587
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:49.160
<v Speaker 6>the industry and she lost her job.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like if there was no youtube to upload </v>

<v Speaker 6>this is absolutely.</v>

<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

590
00:26:52.231 --> 00:26:53.400
<v Speaker 6>35,</v>
<v Speaker 6>40 years later,</v>

591
00:26:53.401 --> 00:26:58.401
<v Speaker 6>it's like a career move.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No one ever saw that and liquid Kim </v>

<v Speaker 6>it's just not one accident.</v>

594
00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:04.110
<v Speaker 6>Several,</v>
<v Speaker 6>several camera goals.</v>

595
00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:06.600
<v Speaker 6>But she's like that brilliant to be </v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

596
00:27:06.601 --> 00:27:08.810
<v Speaker 6>this is how well wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Paris Hilton already done it.</v>

597
00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:11.640
<v Speaker 6>Paris Hilton got famous that way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So that's how she got them.</v>

598
00:27:11.641 --> 00:27:13.530
<v Speaker 6>She had a famous boyfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she was dating this guy,</v>

599
00:27:13.531 --> 00:27:16.590
<v Speaker 6>Ray j,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's usually the famous guy gets all</v>

600
00:27:16.591 --> 00:27:18.450
<v Speaker 6>the press unless you banged somebody </v>
<v Speaker 6>else famous.</v>

601
00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:20.420
<v Speaker 6>Well he got,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he got a lot of press from that.</v>

602
00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:22.320
<v Speaker 6>It's just he couldn't maintain it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He just,</v>

603
00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:27.380
<v Speaker 6>for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean I think he's still like big in </v>

604
00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:28.800
<v Speaker 6>his and b community or whatever kind of </v>
<v Speaker 6>music he plays.</v>

605
00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:31.080
<v Speaker 6>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

606
00:27:31.081 --> 00:27:32.280
<v Speaker 6>for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

607
00:27:32.281 --> 00:27:33.870
<v Speaker 6>it's not like he's an unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's a,</v>

608
00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:36.660
<v Speaker 6>he's still a pretty known guy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but she became,</v>

609
00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:42.340
<v Speaker 6>whether he's known or unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's usually like the unknown person </v>

610
00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:42.390
<v Speaker 6>who's getting banged.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

611
00:27:42.410 --> 00:27:43.770
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like Joe blow,</v>

612
00:27:43.771 --> 00:27:45.510
<v Speaker 6>fuck Sahar right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

613
00:27:45.511 --> 00:27:46.590
<v Speaker 6>like you're just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know.</v>

614
00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:48.890
<v Speaker 6>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>or whatever.</v>

615
00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:51.840
<v Speaker 6>But I guess she was so good looking </v>
<v Speaker 6>people wanting to know who she was.</v>

616
00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:54.420
<v Speaker 6>Like the dvr girl.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All of a sudden everyone's like,</v>

617
00:27:54.421 --> 00:27:58.140
<v Speaker 6>who's that girl in the commercial exotic</v>
<v Speaker 6>looking one and then you look it up.</v>

618
00:27:58.590 --> 00:27:59.950
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I definitely think that.</v>

619
00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:01.170
<v Speaker 6>But I also think,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

620
00:28:01.171 --> 00:28:06.171
<v Speaker 6>I think that she was just fucking rabid </v>
<v Speaker 6>opportunist and it was in the same time </v>

621
00:28:07.531 --> 00:28:12.000
<v Speaker 6>that Paris Hilton really got more famous</v>
<v Speaker 6>because of her sex tape.</v>

622
00:28:12.001 --> 00:28:17.001
<v Speaker 6>And then remember when girls would just </v>
<v Speaker 6>showing their pussies like they would </v>

623
00:28:17.001 --> 00:28:17.950
<v Speaker 6>climb out of cars and not know that the </v>
<v Speaker 6>Paparazzi,</v>

624
00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:20.130
<v Speaker 6>he had a fucking camera and interim or </v>
<v Speaker 6>snatch.</v>

625
00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:21.840
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how many girls were.</v>

626
00:28:21.841 --> 00:28:26.640
<v Speaker 6>They had those download photos to the </v>
<v Speaker 6>most ridiculous photos ever because it's</v>

627
00:28:26.641 --> 00:28:28.260
<v Speaker 6>so fucking obvious that you've,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you've,</v>

628
00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:31.500
<v Speaker 6>you plan that the camera is below your </v>
<v Speaker 6>pussy.</v>

629
00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:36.920
<v Speaker 6>You're getting out of a car and the </v>
<v Speaker 6>camera's below your pussy looking up at </v>

630
00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:37.880
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fuck yeah,</v>

631
00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:42.060
<v Speaker 6>100 percent guaranteed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's all like Paris Hilton.</v>

632
00:28:42.061 --> 00:28:45.210
<v Speaker 6>It was all these real dumb skanks no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no offense.</v>

633
00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:46.250
<v Speaker 6>But all these,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

634
00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:49.170
<v Speaker 6>these really silly girls,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

635
00:28:49.171 --> 00:28:51.810

<v Speaker 6>those were the girls are fun girls.</v>

636

<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

637
00:28:52.501 --> 00:28:57.501
<v Speaker 6>the knucklehead girls.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that was their move to show their </v>

638
00:28:57.501 --> 00:28:59.781
<v Speaker 6>pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And they were distinct advantage as a </v>

639
00:28:59.781 --> 00:29:03.831
<v Speaker 6>woman.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like if I got out with a kilt and you </v>

640
00:29:03.831 --> 00:29:03.831
<v Speaker 6>flashed your junk,</v>

641
00:29:03.831 --> 00:29:05.940

<v Speaker 6>It's offensive.</v>

642
00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:10.050
<v Speaker 6>No whipping out your cock is way more </v>
<v Speaker 6>offensive than showing of your pussy.</v>

643
00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:11.920
<v Speaker 6>He can climb out of a car and show your </v>

00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:29.430
<v Speaker 6>it's also spatial awareness.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a difference in the genetics is </v>

696
00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:30.010
<v Speaker 6>there's also different in reaction time </v>
<v Speaker 6>of significant difference.</v>

697
00:31:30.011 --> 00:31:32.170
<v Speaker 6>Ten percent difference between men and </v>
<v Speaker 6>women.</v>

698
00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:34.600
<v Speaker 6>Men have a 10 percent faster reaction </v>
<v Speaker 6>time.</v>

699
00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:39.660
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's pretty much the bumping each </v>

700
00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:42.001
<v Speaker 6>other in the head.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Being the first ones out there with a </v>

701
00:31:42.001 --> 00:31:45.751
<v Speaker 6>spear.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Our bodies are just designed for </v>

702
00:31:45.751 --> 00:31:45.751
<v Speaker 6>different shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When we were hunter gatherers,</v>

703
00:31:45.751 --> 00:31:46.150
<v Speaker 6>we were hunters.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

704
00:31:46.151 --> 00:31:50.410
<v Speaker 6>let's just do this wrong with getting a </v>
<v Speaker 6>sex change operation.</v>

705
00:31:50.411 --> 00:31:55.411
<v Speaker 6>Whatever God bless you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but like to go in the ring with women </v>

706
00:31:55.411 --> 00:31:55.830
<v Speaker 6>and beat the shit out of a woman like </v>
<v Speaker 6>that know,</v>

707
00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:59.330
<v Speaker 6>especially for fighting is one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you know,</v>

708
00:31:59.410 --> 00:32:01.210
<v Speaker 6>and this is where I'm getting the </v>
<v Speaker 6>stress,</v>

709
00:32:02.410 --> 00:32:04.960
<v Speaker 6>this is where I'm getting a stress from </v>
<v Speaker 6>getting it from,</v>

710
00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:09.990
<v Speaker 6>from feminists and I'm getting it from </v>
<v Speaker 6>people that support a transsexuals </v>

711
00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:15.180
<v Speaker 6>because they want a transgender woman to</v>
<v Speaker 6>be considered a 100 percent woman and </v>

712
00:32:16.181 --> 00:32:16.900
<v Speaker 6>they're like a trans.</v>

713
00:32:17.050 --> 00:32:18.940
<v Speaker 6>This is the argument I've been getting </v>
<v Speaker 6>all online.</v>

714
00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:21.970
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a trans woman is a woman asshole.</v>

715
00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:25.570
<v Speaker 6>A Trans woman is a real woman.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Your bigotry and transphobia.</v>

716
00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:29.890
<v Speaker 6>I'm transphobic apparently because I </v>
<v Speaker 6>don't want men to get their dick chopped</v>

717
00:32:29.891 --> 00:32:31.570
<v Speaker 6>off and beat the shit out of women.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

718
00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:36.780
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I am 100 percent supportive of anybody </v>

719
00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:36.780
<v Speaker 6>like a hot dog.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then they make a giant lay.</v>

720
00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:38.440
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm looking at it right now.</v>

721
00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:40.130
<v Speaker 6>They make like a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they don't,</v>

722
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:40.760
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

723
00:32:40.761 --> 00:32:43.010
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what they do.</v>

724
00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:46.400
<v Speaker 4>They call it a peanut on version,</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually pnl in version.</v>

725
00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:51.460
<v Speaker 4>And then they got to like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how they scoop out your </v>

726
00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:54.160
<v Speaker 4>tank,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just hardcore.</v>

727
00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:56.000
<v Speaker 4>This has got to be some stuff in there </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you're just.</v>

728
00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:58.370
<v Speaker 4>It's like the crawl space under your </v>
<v Speaker 4>house.</v>

729
00:32:58.371 --> 00:33:02.620
<v Speaker 4>You don't know what's on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Listen,</v>

730
00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:05.270
<v Speaker 4>if someone wants to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God bless you.</v>

731
00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:07.430
<v Speaker 4>If you want to be referred to as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>woman,</v>

732
00:33:07.431 --> 00:33:07.950
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

733
00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:11.150
<v Speaker 4>I'm fine with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But like don't get in a ring and start.</v>

734
00:33:11.270 --> 00:33:14.000
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>concussion sounded pounding.</v>

735
00:33:14.010 --> 00:33:15.530
<v Speaker 4>Some woman would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

736
00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:18.320
<v Speaker 4>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ain't take estrogen pills.</v>

737
00:33:18.321 --> 00:33:19.000
<v Speaker 4>They shot,</v>

738
00:33:19.670 --> 00:33:24.670
<v Speaker 1>they take shots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in their muscle mass does decrease </v>

739
00:33:24.670 --> 00:33:25.830
<v Speaker 1>and their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

740
00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:28.760
<v Speaker 1>their bone density does decrease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>

741
00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:32.630
<v Speaker 1>But there's just some massive mechanical</v>
<v Speaker 1>advantage of the male frame.</v>

742
00:33:32.631 --> 00:33:34.370
<v Speaker 1>When it comes to something like combat </v>
<v Speaker 1>sports,</v>

743
00:33:34.371 --> 00:33:39.371
<v Speaker 1>the shape of the hips are different </v>
<v Speaker 1>because no matter all the take them man </v>

744
00:33:39.371 --> 00:33:41.030
<v Speaker 1>can take all the estrogen in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't really develop a woman's hips</v>

745
00:33:41.031 --> 00:33:46.031
<v Speaker 1>is a completely different structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when it comes to kicking that </v>

746
00:33:46.031 --> 00:33:47.180
<v Speaker 1>structure makes a big difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>

747
00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:52.630
<v Speaker 4>Cheesecake sits on the couch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a saddlebag work like Mariah Carey </v>

748
00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:54.470
<v Speaker 4>built.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

749
00:33:54.530 --> 00:33:56.560
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

750
00:33:56.990 --> 00:34:01.990
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't look like that Bill Clinton </v>

751
00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:03.710
<v Speaker 4>had bitch hips.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your body looks like he had big,</v>

752
00:34:03.711 --> 00:34:08.711
<v Speaker 4>big mother and hips.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I bet he had a lot of knee problems and </v>

753
00:34:08.711 --> 00:34:08.711
<v Speaker 4>he was jogging.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

754
00:34:08.711 --> 00:34:10.130
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure he went out the acs fat as </v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>

755
00:34:10.131 --> 00:34:11.390
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

756
00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:17.950
<v Speaker 4>What about this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What about the guy that has down </v>

757
00:34:17.950 --> 00:34:17.950
<v Speaker 4>syndrome that wants to fight?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

758
00:34:17.950 --> 00:34:17.950
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blimey.</v>

759
00:34:17.950 --> 00:34:18.440
<v Speaker 1>Well we'll get to that too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

760
00:34:18.441 --> 00:34:20.580
<v Speaker 1>But I thought that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

761
00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:25.960
<v Speaker 1>the craziest thing about this is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>these women in this desire to be super,</v>

762
00:34:27.201 --> 00:34:32.201
<v Speaker 1>super progressive and super supportive </v>
<v Speaker 1>of gay rights and transgender rights,</v>

763
00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:37.690
<v Speaker 1>that they're willing to allow other </v>
<v Speaker 1>women to get the fuck beat out of them </v>

764
00:34:37.690 --> 00:34:39.260
<v Speaker 1>because it's almost all women that got </v>
<v Speaker 1>upset with me.</v>

765
00:34:39.261 --> 00:34:42.470
<v Speaker 1>There's a few guys like gay guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got upset with me,</v>

766
00:34:42.650 --> 00:34:45.380
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite a few women wanted that,</v>

767
00:34:45.490 --> 00:34:47.960
<v Speaker 1>that transgender woman to be recognized </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a woman.</v>

768
00:34:48.140 --> 00:34:53.140
<v Speaker 1>And I said like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm 100 percent supportive of someone </v>

769
00:34:53.140 --> 00:34:54.350
<v Speaker 1>doing that and I'm willing to call them </v>
<v Speaker 1>a girl in a sheet and whatever your name</v>

770
00:34:54.351 --> 00:34:55.130
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm cool with that.</v>

771
00:34:55.131 --> 00:34:56.480
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind,</v>

772
00:34:56.630 --> 00:35:00.240
<v Speaker 1>but the fighting men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the girls,</v>

773
00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:02.900
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing how much resistance I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>gotten from this.</v>

774
00:35:02.901 --> 00:35:03.920
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>

775
00:35:03.921 --> 00:35:04.730
<v Speaker 1>truly amazing.</v>

776
00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:08.030
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody's entitled to an opinion.</v>

777
00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:11.110
<v Speaker 4>Opinion isn't going to stop them from </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing anything like people get,</v>

778
00:35:11.170 --> 00:35:13.000
<v Speaker 4>you know what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just that you're kind of known,</v>

779
00:35:13.001 --> 00:35:18.001
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean in that area.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's a good thing for them to hitch </v>

780
00:35:18.001 --> 00:35:19.570
<v Speaker 4>their wagon to where like I've noticed </v>
<v Speaker 4>that a lot of people,</v>

781
00:35:19.571 --> 00:35:21.820
<v Speaker 4>they don't really get offended by </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything that I say.</v>

782
00:35:21.821 --> 00:35:23.890
<v Speaker 4>It's because there's nothing to attach </v>
<v Speaker 4>your wagon to.</v>

783
00:35:24.010 --> 00:35:26.070
<v Speaker 4>I do try to stand up and like strip </v>
<v Speaker 4>malls,</v>

784
00:35:26.071 --> 00:35:31.071
<v Speaker 4>so I jumped on Conan that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's usually the punishment end up,</v>

785
00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:32.740
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

786
00:35:32.741 --> 00:35:35.800
<v Speaker 4>What are you going to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What I mean and I'm not a doctor either.</v>

787
00:35:35.801 --> 00:35:38.070
<v Speaker 4>Do like if somebody came up like I </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually,</v>

788
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:43.070
<v Speaker 2>this is what annoys me about groups like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that as I feel that when somebody says </v>

789
00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:47.721
<v Speaker 2>something and you're offended,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very easy for them to get in </v>

790
00:35:47.721 --> 00:35:47.721
<v Speaker 2>contact with us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fairly easy with twitter,</v>

791
00:35:47.721 --> 00:35:52.671
<v Speaker 2>facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of that to to hear that makes sure </v>

792
00:35:52.671 --> 00:35:54.570
<v Speaker 2>that they're hearing it right to clarify</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you say and they don't.</v>

793
00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:57.240
<v Speaker 2>They want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to do is create this,</v>

794
00:35:57.330 --> 00:35:59.550
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this hysteria,</v>

795
00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:04.760
<v Speaker 2>and then they get you on tv and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the split screen and that split </v>

796
00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:06.900
<v Speaker 2>screen argument is not about finding </v>
<v Speaker 2>some truth.</v>

797
00:36:06.901 --> 00:36:11.901
<v Speaker 2>It's just about winning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they go out there and as you </v>

798
00:36:11.901 --> 00:36:13.050
<v Speaker 2>start to make a good point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll go see that.</v>

799
00:36:13.051 --> 00:36:14.840
<v Speaker 2>See that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just the ignorance.</v>

800
00:36:14.841 --> 00:36:18.900
<v Speaker 2>That night they shout you down and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the worst tv you'll ever fucking</v>

801
00:36:20.590 --> 00:36:23.500
<v Speaker 6>debate things where you have three </v>
<v Speaker 6>minutes to make your point.</v>

802
00:36:23.501 --> 00:36:28.501
<v Speaker 6>They're the dumbest ways to address a </v>
<v Speaker 6>complex issue than anybody could ever </v>

803
00:36:28.501 --> 00:36:28.501
<v Speaker 6>get her.</v>

804
00:36:29.290 --> 00:36:31.540
<v Speaker 2>That's get came from PTI.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think on ESPN.</v>

805
00:36:31.570 --> 00:36:36.570
<v Speaker 2>It was a sports show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These two good friends used to yell at </v>

806
00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:36.570
<v Speaker 2>each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not yell,</v>

807
00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:40.921
<v Speaker 2>but they will make great points and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>would get heated sometimes and that do </v>

808
00:36:40.921 --> 00:36:41.110
<v Speaker 2>and they blew up because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>

809
00:36:41.111 --> 00:36:43.810
<v Speaker 2>You saw the friendship there and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were just like,</v>

810
00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:44.500
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they like</v>

811
00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:49.700
<v Speaker 6>people yell.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They just boil it down and next thing </v>

812
00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:49.700
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>everybody's just screaming.</v>

813
00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:54.160
<v Speaker 6>They always do that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They have like some guy whose kids got </v>

814
00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:57.111
<v Speaker 6>shot a school and then next to another </v>
<v Speaker 6>guy who's like a fucking one of those </v>

815
00:36:57.111 --> 00:37:01.851
<v Speaker 6>militia guys who thinks we should all </v>
<v Speaker 6>have assault rifles and then Pierce </v>

816
00:37:01.851 --> 00:37:06.350
<v Speaker 6>Morgan pretends it's a debate.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They put two pit bulls and it's what </v>

817
00:37:06.350 --> 00:37:06.350
<v Speaker 6>they do and then they just sit back and </v>
<v Speaker 6>think,</v>

818
00:37:06.350 --> 00:37:07.770
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's going to kill eight minutes.</v>

819
00:37:07.890 --> 00:37:09.960
<v Speaker 6>Well we talked about it on the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

820
00:37:09.961 --> 00:37:12.360
<v Speaker 6>that's when the discussion happened that</v>
<v Speaker 6>got to the air.</v>

821
00:37:12.361 --> 00:37:16.230
<v Speaker 6>So they had plenty of opportunity to see</v>
<v Speaker 6>what I meant and what I didn't mean,</v>

822
00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:20.130
<v Speaker 6>but they choose to only lock onto like </v>
<v Speaker 6>some of the things that I said like it's</v>

823
00:37:20.131 --> 00:37:25.131
<v Speaker 6>a guy with no dick and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and that's where they got really mad at </v>

824
00:37:25.131 --> 00:37:25.980
<v Speaker 6>you because that's hurtful.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's transphobic.</v>

825
00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:29.620
<v Speaker 6>But technically it's accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I understand what you're saying.</v>

826
00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:30.200
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

827
00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:33.420
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is a guy who had his penis removed.</v>

828
00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:34.630
<v Speaker 6>Yes it is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

829
00:37:34.690 --> 00:37:38.350
<v Speaker 6>chromosome will try to look like he had </v>
<v Speaker 6>female parts,</v>

830
00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:41.350
<v Speaker 6>but here's something weird I found out </v>
<v Speaker 6>when you do chromosome tests,</v>

831
00:37:41.370 --> 00:37:46.370
<v Speaker 6>what are blowing up right now?</v>
<v Speaker 6>A lot of women have the y chromosome </v>

832
00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:47.770
<v Speaker 6>actual,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just women,</v>

833
00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:49.440
<v Speaker 6>real women.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't even know.</v>

834
00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:51.160
<v Speaker 6>Not hermaphrodites.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't know what it means.</v>

835
00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:53.500
<v Speaker 6>Women are xx mentor x,</v>
<v Speaker 6>y.</v>

836
00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:56.410
<v Speaker 6>The y chromosome is the differentiator </v>
<v Speaker 6>between men and women.</v>

837
00:37:56.590 --> 00:38:01.590
<v Speaker 6>Everyone's born a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Still respect the fact that you told me </v>

838
00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:04.801
<v Speaker 6>that like I'm going to retain that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not going to come in the next time </v>

839
00:38:04.801 --> 00:38:06.520
<v Speaker 6>when you bring that up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But while this was going on,</v>

840
00:38:06.521 --> 00:38:08.620
<v Speaker 6>I was thinking of you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was thinking man,</v>

841
00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:12.220
<v Speaker 6>is bill burr was in this situation </v>
<v Speaker 6>because you know,</v>

842
00:38:12.221 --> 00:38:14.620
<v Speaker 6>you're just a.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It seems like,</v>

843
00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:16.600
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like with the crips Chris Brown thing,</v>

844
00:38:16.810 --> 00:38:21.270
<v Speaker 6>you're one of the few guys out there </v>
<v Speaker 6>that will go there with a bit like that.</v>

845
00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:26.280
<v Speaker 6>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I want to know what the fuck she said </v>

846
00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:26.280
<v Speaker 6>before he hit her.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

847
00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:26.280
<v Speaker 6>there's a lot of people out there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

848
00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:26.280
<v Speaker 6>My</v>

849
00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:27.710
<v Speaker 2>thing about that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

850
00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:30.120
<v Speaker 2>I might,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might question it was,</v>

851
00:38:30.210 --> 00:38:35.210
<v Speaker 2>and it was an honest question was do you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have any personal for your</v>

852
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:40.980
<v Speaker 4>own safety as a woman to not </v>
<v Speaker 4>deliberately sit there and push </v>

853
00:38:41.531 --> 00:38:43.570
<v Speaker 4>somebody's button and get in their </v>
<v Speaker 4>grill,</v>

854
00:38:43.571 --> 00:38:48.571
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and get physical and hit and do all </v>

855
00:38:48.571 --> 00:38:49.870
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It gets to a point of like,</v>

856
00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:52.660
<v Speaker 4>my thing was like respect the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 4>a guy's going to hit you,</v>

857
00:38:52.661 --> 00:38:54.790
<v Speaker 4>don't take advantage of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's like,</v>

858
00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:56.590
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

859
00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:58.840
<v Speaker 4>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if that's right or wrong,</v>

860
00:38:58.841 --> 00:39:01.900
<v Speaker 4>but it was a question that these groups,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't talk to them.</v>

861
00:39:01.901 --> 00:39:04.120
<v Speaker 4>You just want to ask them like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you feel like,</v>

862
00:39:04.121 --> 00:39:05.790
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if you just go,</v>

863
00:39:05.870 --> 00:39:07.230
<v Speaker 4>well that's why your mom's Dad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

864
00:39:07.250 --> 00:39:08.740
<v Speaker 4>I hope you get fucking cancer too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

865
00:39:08.741 --> 00:39:10.630
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and just say this horrible,</v>

866
00:39:10.631 --> 00:39:12.790
<v Speaker 4>hurtful shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Start pushing somebody.</v>

867
00:39:12.791 --> 00:39:16.150
<v Speaker 4>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at what point are you guilty of,</v>

868
00:39:16.170 --> 00:39:18.910
<v Speaker 4>of provoking the next level?</v>

869
00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:22.010
<v Speaker 6>If a woman got in your face and you were</v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

870
00:39:22.011 --> 00:39:25.640
<v Speaker 6>seriously worried that she was going to </v>
<v Speaker 6>hit you and you really felt like you had</v>

871
00:39:25.641 --> 00:39:26.870
<v Speaker 6>to defend yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 6>would you hit her?</v>

872
00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:27.880
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

873
00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:29.060
<v Speaker 4>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would have.</v>

874
00:39:29.090 --> 00:39:32.090
<v Speaker 4>She would have to have a fucking machete</v>
<v Speaker 4>really.</v>

875
00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:32.920
<v Speaker 4>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

876
00:39:32.930 --> 00:39:34.610
<v Speaker 4>I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would have to be like,</v>

877
00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:37.550
<v Speaker 4>I will be doing that stuff just running </v>
<v Speaker 4>around the walls.</v>

878
00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:38.040
<v Speaker 4>I get</v>

879
00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:43.230
<v Speaker 6>cardio.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right where you usually have better </v>

880
00:39:43.781 --> 00:39:45.480
<v Speaker 6>cardio the man when it comes to the </v>
<v Speaker 6>jargon,</v>

881
00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:48.230
<v Speaker 6>when it comes to the ones who jog a lot </v>
<v Speaker 6>of,</v>

882
00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:52.300
<v Speaker 6>especially the ones that hit you that </v>
<v Speaker 6>more likely to have pent up frustrations</v>

883
00:39:52.301 --> 00:39:53.710
<v Speaker 6>and getting out with the exercise?</v>

884
00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:55.140
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I dated a girl one time.</v>

885
00:39:55.141 --> 00:39:57.030
<v Speaker 4>She,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she had some issues about when she would</v>

886
00:39:57.031 --> 00:40:00.120
<v Speaker 4>get mad she would get physical and I had</v>
<v Speaker 4>to talk to her about it.</v>

887
00:40:01.050 --> 00:40:06.050
<v Speaker 4>That saying that you've got to </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand that the natural reaction to </v>

888
00:40:06.050 --> 00:40:07.560
<v Speaker 4>this is this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't just walk around hitting feet.</v>

889
00:40:07.561 --> 00:40:11.520
<v Speaker 4>That's so disrespectful and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>childish and it need to grow up.</v>

890
00:40:11.550 --> 00:40:13.980
<v Speaker 4>Like I had to have that conversation </v>
<v Speaker 4>because,</v>

891
00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:15.800
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

892
00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:21.590
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's in that split second when somebody </v>

893
00:40:21.590 --> 00:40:21.590
<v Speaker 4>blast you in the face,</v>
<v Speaker 4>either man or a woman,</v>

894
00:40:21.590 --> 00:40:24.120
<v Speaker 4>it's like you go into self defense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you eat,</v>

895
00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:26.250
<v Speaker 4>you might even just out of reaction go </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>

896
00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:31.280
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of times guys are so much bigger </v>

897
00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:31.280
<v Speaker 4>than women.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a forum.</v>

898
00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:32.640
<v Speaker 4>Then their nose is bleeding and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're down the fucking police station.</v>

899
00:40:32.730 --> 00:40:34.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you have like a problem.</v>

900
00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:35.550
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

901
00:40:35.970 --> 00:40:37.620
<v Speaker 4>my thing and all those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is,</v>

902
00:40:37.621 --> 00:40:39.560
<v Speaker 4>you never learn anything you never </v>
<v Speaker 4>learned.</v>

903
00:40:39.561 --> 00:40:44.160
<v Speaker 4>Like was this guy just a bad guy and </v>
<v Speaker 4>this was inevitable and what happened in</v>

904
00:40:44.161 --> 00:40:49.161
<v Speaker 4>his childhood?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can we deconstruct this guy </v>

905
00:40:49.161 --> 00:40:51.541
<v Speaker 4>psychologically?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can we go back and figure out what led </v>

906
00:40:51.541 --> 00:40:53.820
<v Speaker 4>to this event?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or was it like he has no track record of</v>

907
00:40:53.821 --> 00:40:58.821
<v Speaker 4>this and then all of a sudden it just </v>
<v Speaker 4>the right set of circumstances and it's </v>

908
00:40:58.821 --> 00:40:59.910
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is this guy a bad guy?</v>

909
00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:03.160
<v Speaker 4>Is this guy I'm unlucky guy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

910
00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:04.020
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what happened?</v>

911
00:41:04.021 --> 00:41:05.340
<v Speaker 4>But I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to tell you.</v>

912
00:41:05.370 --> 00:41:06.090
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

913
00:41:06.690 --> 00:41:09.270
<v Speaker 4>the first punch you flipped out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean once you fucking,</v>

914
00:41:09.271 --> 00:41:14.271
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we set up the jab throwing </v>

915
00:41:14.271 --> 00:41:14.271
<v Speaker 4>combinations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like at some point you got to be in</v>

916
00:41:14.271 --> 00:41:18.681
<v Speaker 4>your head like I am hitting a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the conversation fascinates me and </v>

917
00:41:18.681 --> 00:41:19.080
<v Speaker 4>it's such a touchy subject.</v>

918
00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:24.080
<v Speaker 4>What's annoying is that you can't like </v>
<v Speaker 4>the amount of people who are listening </v>

919
00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:24.210
<v Speaker 4>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that scowl on her face,</v>

920
00:41:24.211 --> 00:41:27.240
<v Speaker 4>like you can't even,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't unless you just go,</v>

921
00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:32.960
<v Speaker 4>you are 100 percent right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was no reason to ever do it and </v>

922
00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:36.621
<v Speaker 4>you don't have to respect another being </v>
<v Speaker 4>on any level and you can throw stuff at </v>

923
00:41:36.621 --> 00:41:37.380
<v Speaker 4>them and you can say stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can,</v>

924
00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:40.430
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>push their buttons and do everything you</v>

925
00:41:40.431 --> 00:41:44.000
<v Speaker 4>basically can to get it to that point </v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

926
00:41:44.001 --> 00:41:44.810
<v Speaker 4>and then.</v>

<v Speaker 4>you're not guilty.</v>

928
00:41:46.581 --> 00:41:50.150
<v Speaker 4>You don't have any responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing that you could do in the</v>

929
00:41:50.151 --> 00:41:51.200
<v Speaker 4>future to be like,</v>

933

<v Speaker 4>you immediately lock yourself in the </v>

950
00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:42.420
<v Speaker 4>bathroom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He goes and then call the police.</v>

951
00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:42.960
<v Speaker 4>That's good advice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

952
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.290
<v Speaker 4>Just lock yourself in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

953
00:42:44.291 --> 00:42:47.140
<v Speaker 4>you don't have any strike marks because </v>
<v Speaker 4>they can,</v>

954
00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:48.980
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

957
00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:52.850
<v Speaker 4>That's a good move.</v>

958
00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:54.430
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the swim from.</v>

<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

960
00:42:56.641 --> 00:42:59.200
<v Speaker 1>it's controversy and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hitting women.</v>

961
00:42:59.210 --> 00:43:01.990
<v Speaker 1>I've never hit a woman ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but obviously,</v>

962
00:43:02.050 --> 00:43:03.910
<v Speaker 1>but I could never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could never do it,</v>

963
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.420
<v Speaker 1>but I would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If a woman was attacking me,</v>

964
00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:10.090
<v Speaker 1>I would knock on conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt about it.</v>

965
00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:15.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean if a woman was coming in with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>knife trying to hit me with a ball one </v>

966
00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:19.150
<v Speaker 1>or window haymaker right to the chops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to take them out,</v>

00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:20.980
<v Speaker 1>take them out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop playing games.</v>

968
00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:26.030
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to hit a check,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to blast him right in the </v>

969
00:43:26.030 --> 00:43:28.651
<v Speaker 1>face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most chicks are just not prepared for </v>

970
00:43:28.651 --> 00:43:29.680
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not prepared for that either.</v>

971
00:43:30.130 --> 00:43:35.130
<v Speaker 1>Nobody is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would only do it to save my life </v>

972
00:43:35.130 --> 00:43:35.440
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my safety.</v>

973
00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:37.090
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you never know man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>her to one of those fucking things at </v>

<v Speaker 1>if this girl's soccer punch me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to wake up with a flashlight </v>

982
00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:02.220
<v Speaker 1>in my face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No</v>

983
00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:02.220
<v Speaker 4>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what?</v>

984
00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:02.230
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't like,</v>

985
00:44:02.290 --> 00:44:07.290
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't like watching when the women </v>

986
00:44:07.290 --> 00:44:07.290
<v Speaker 4>fight each other and fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really.</v>

987
00:44:07.290 --> 00:44:07.600
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't like it.</v>

988
00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:13.420
<v Speaker 4>You know what they should do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They should have them fight like </v>

989
00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:14.470
<v Speaker 4>convicted rapist and the rapist don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>know that the fight is going to happen.</v>

990
00:44:14.530 --> 00:44:16.660
<v Speaker 4>So then I got to shape eating prison </v>
<v Speaker 4>food.</v>

991
00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:23.630
<v Speaker 4>Just come out there and then you have to</v>
<v Speaker 4>be rapist in the right weight class and </v>

<v Speaker 4>they just get in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

993

<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can work all the details and they </v>

<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

<v Speaker 4>But to sit there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well just sit there and uh,</v>

996
00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:33.950

<v Speaker 4>like they don't want to hate a.</v>

997

<v Speaker 4>When they punch each other and they hit </v>
<v Speaker 4>that Teddy's</v>

998
00:44:37.930 --> 00:44:38.560
<v Speaker 5>sacred.</v>

999
00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:43.580
<v Speaker 1>If I run a rosy and Liz Carmouche,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ronda Rousey got kicked in the tits,</v>

1000
00:44:44.490 --> 00:44:46.840
<v Speaker 1>shout out just before she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1001
00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:48.240
<v Speaker 4>got back to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you,</v>

1002
00:44:48.250 --> 00:44:48.950
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

1003
00:44:48.951 --> 00:44:50.750
<v Speaker 4>they have a name for that within their </v>
<v Speaker 4>circle.</v>

1004
00:44:51.350 --> 00:44:53.930
<v Speaker 4>What that feeling is kick to kick to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>tits.</v>

1005
00:44:53.931 --> 00:44:56.840
<v Speaker 4>They got to have some sort of slang for </v>
<v Speaker 4>it where um,</v>

1006
00:44:57.230 --> 00:44:58.040
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it'd be funny,</v>

1007
00:44:58.041 --> 00:44:59.720
<v Speaker 4>but I would never want to take the ass </v>
<v Speaker 4>kicking was,</v>

1008
00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:02.420
<v Speaker 4>is how bad those girls could beat me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Somebody.</v>

1009
00:45:02.421 --> 00:45:06.200
<v Speaker 4>Somebody like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like three weight classes below me.</v>

1010
00:45:06.410 --> 00:45:09.470
<v Speaker 4>Well Rhonda Rousey would be a good one </v>
<v Speaker 4>on me because she's a grappler.</v>

1011
00:45:09.471 --> 00:45:13.800
<v Speaker 4>She'd just getting you in an arm bar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Training is for brothers,</v>

1012
00:45:13.830 --> 00:45:14.740
<v Speaker 4>headlock,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dual head</v>

1013
00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:17.380
<v Speaker 5>throwing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Keep it from here to here.</v>

1014
00:45:17.381 --> 00:45:21.340
<v Speaker 5>So Dad doesn't get mad it from Chin,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Chin to belt.</v>

1015
00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:26.360
<v Speaker 5>Yet if somebody starts winning,</v>
<v Speaker 5>always punched in the hair the.</v>

1016
00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:29.530
<v Speaker 5>So the lump lump wouldn't show up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1017
00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:31.570
<v Speaker 5>it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we were learning basically how to beat a</v>

1018
00:45:31.571 --> 00:45:33.730
<v Speaker 5>woman,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I didn't really look at it,</v>

1019
00:45:33.731 --> 00:45:34.900
<v Speaker 5>but we would do it to each other.</v>

1020
00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:37.630
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that.</v>

1021
00:45:37.631 --> 00:45:41.860
<v Speaker 4>But I really think that like it would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it'd be great if somehow you could teach</v>

1022
00:45:41.890 --> 00:45:45.670
<v Speaker 4>women that because of all these dirt </v>
<v Speaker 4>bags and these guys who do hit women,</v>

1023
00:45:45.671 --> 00:45:48.100
<v Speaker 4>if you were to teach them that so they </v>
<v Speaker 4>could have that,</v>

1024
00:45:48.130 --> 00:45:50.500
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be able to defend themselves.</v>

1025
00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:50.930
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1026
00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:56.680
<v Speaker 1>Almost always the best option because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have your legs,</v>

1027
00:45:56.700 --> 00:45:57.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a woman's legs,</v>

1028
00:45:57.881 --> 00:46:00.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think about it can carry you and you</v>

1029
00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:05.180
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you weigh 130 pounds or whatever your </v>

1030
00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:07.081
<v Speaker 1>weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're fucking carrying you around all </v>

1031
00:46:07.081 --> 00:46:07.081
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that with your arms.</v>

1032
00:46:07.081 --> 00:46:09.100
<v Speaker 1>So you could lock them man up in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>triangle or an arm bar and fuck them up.</v>

1033
00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:09.910
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he really,</v>

1034
00:46:10.090 --> 00:46:13.210
<v Speaker 1>a woman like Rhonda Rousey could break </v>
<v Speaker 1>my arm easily.</v>

1035
00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:15.940
<v Speaker 1>She got me in an arm bar for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She could break my arm.</v>

1036
00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:16.710
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1037
00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:20.020
<v Speaker 4>I don't know why they send those kinds </v>
<v Speaker 4>of people to jail,</v>

1038
00:46:20.021 --> 00:46:23.230
<v Speaker 4>like rapist to study should just shoot </v>
<v Speaker 4>him in the street like a rabid dog.</v>

1039
00:46:23.350 --> 00:46:25.180
<v Speaker 4>That's how I feel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was.</v>

1040
00:46:26.090 --> 00:46:28.300
<v Speaker 4>You do any of that that sent you over?</v>

1041
00:46:28.410 --> 00:46:29.450
<v Speaker 1>We had a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we.</v>

1042
00:46:29.451 --> 00:46:32.130
<v Speaker 1>There was a video of some guy who's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>shooter,</v>

1043
00:46:32.170 --> 00:46:37.170
<v Speaker 1>a school shooter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was taunting the family of the </v>

1044
00:46:37.170 --> 00:46:39.411
<v Speaker 1>victims and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only reason he's doing this because </v>

1045
00:46:39.411 --> 00:46:41.931
<v Speaker 1>he's in a court and because he knows </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's laws and things are protecting </v>

1046
00:46:41.931 --> 00:46:41.931
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should beat that guy to death</v>

1047
00:46:41.931 --> 00:46:43.870
<v Speaker 4>in the family that's got to sit there </v>
<v Speaker 4>and take that.</v>

1048
00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:45.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who played by the rules.</v>

1049
00:46:45.521 --> 00:46:50.521
<v Speaker 4>It's just like you'll never forget him </v>
<v Speaker 4>taunting you and just like the fact that</v>

1050
00:46:51.401 --> 00:46:55.360
<v Speaker 4>he's like still alive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's certain rather holidays,</v>

1051
00:46:55.361 --> 00:46:56.670
<v Speaker 4>he gets a decent meal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1052
00:46:56.671 --> 00:46:57.560
<v Speaker 4>There's aspects of it</v>

1053
00:46:57.630 --> 00:46:58.340
<v Speaker 1>law that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1054
00:46:58.390 --> 00:47:03.390
<v Speaker 1>that there's aspects to all human </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior where we have like workplace </v>

1055
00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:08.240
<v Speaker 1>rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you have to behave here,</v>

1056
00:47:08.241 --> 00:47:13.241
<v Speaker 1>you have courtroom rules where you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to behave like this and that allows </v>

1057
00:47:13.761 --> 00:47:16.910
<v Speaker 1>people to get away with some fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous shit like that.</v>

1058
00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:22.480
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're supposed to act civilized to </v>

1059
00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:22.480
<v Speaker 4>someone who isn't civilized and I get </v>
<v Speaker 4>that to a certain point,</v>

1060
00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:25.380
<v Speaker 4>but it's just like you're not going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>cure what somebody is attracted to it.</v>

1061
00:47:25.970 --> 00:47:28.880
<v Speaker 4>So if someone is attracted to kids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like they have to be removed.</v>

1062
00:47:28.930 --> 00:47:30.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no way you can</v>

1063
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:32.260
<v Speaker 6>cure that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Ruins a kid's life.</v>

1064
00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:37.680
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The recidivism rate years like </v>

1065
00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:37.680
<v Speaker 6>generations and generations.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Gee,</v>

1066
00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:39.820
<v Speaker 6>this is really heavy topics,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's weird how like the,</v>

1067
00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:41.410
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that thing is like,</v>

1068
00:47:41.411 --> 00:47:43.750
<v Speaker 6>what,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what's missing is like common sense,</v>

1069
00:47:43.930 --> 00:47:48.930
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and the same can be applied to stand up </v>

1070
00:47:48.930 --> 00:47:50.881
<v Speaker 6>comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like when Tracy Morgan got in trouble </v>

1071
00:47:50.881 --> 00:47:52.600
<v Speaker 6>for joking around about a son saying </v>
<v Speaker 6>that he was established son who's gay.</v>

1072
00:47:52.750 --> 00:47:54.970
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We all knew it was a joke.</v>

1073
00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:00.000
<v Speaker 6>We know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was just saying he's being Tracy </v>

1074
00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.380
<v Speaker 6>Morgan.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's been fucking completely out of </v>

1075
00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:02.380
<v Speaker 6>bounds.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Continues in that direction.</v>

1076
00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:06.780
<v Speaker 6>That's his.</v>
<v Speaker 6>His whole act is being outrageous like </v>

1077
00:48:06.780 --> 00:48:06.780
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you know,</v>

1078
00:48:06.780 --> 00:48:08.170
<v Speaker 6>like common sense goes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

1079
00:48:08.171 --> 00:48:10.270
<v Speaker 6>is he a comedian?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is he telling a joke though?</v>

1080
00:48:10.271 --> 00:48:11.650
<v Speaker 6>That's just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's all it is.</v>

1081
00:48:11.970 --> 00:48:13.450
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it might not be good.</v>

1082
00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:14.110
<v Speaker 6>You might say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

1083
00:48:14.111 --> 00:48:15.820
<v Speaker 6>I think he sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's fine.</v>

1084
00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:21.340
<v Speaker 6>You're allowed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean there's a broad spectrum of what </v>

1085
00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:22.660
<v Speaker 6>people like and don't like joking about </v>
<v Speaker 6>certain subjects as if it bombs.</v>

1086
00:48:22.930 --> 00:48:23.550
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then,</v>

1087
00:48:24.460 --> 00:48:29.460
<v Speaker 6>but if it kills every this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that there's always that legendary line </v>

1088
00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:31.540
<v Speaker 6>to the one comic said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're fucking trying to get out to your</v>

1089
00:48:31.541 --> 00:48:34.570
<v Speaker 6>friends at a diner because you're still </v>
<v Speaker 6>laughing because it was so ridiculous.</v>

1090
00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:37.060
<v Speaker 6>I always use Brian Holzman's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Susan Smith,</v>

1091
00:48:37.061 --> 00:48:39.190
<v Speaker 6>one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Susan Smith was a chicken tender.</v>

1092
00:48:39.191 --> 00:48:44.191
<v Speaker 6>Kid's this motherfucker got on the </v>
<v Speaker 6>comedy store stage a couple of days </v>

1093
00:48:44.191 --> 00:48:48.871
<v Speaker 6>later and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I heard those kids were bad kids and </v>

1094
00:48:48.871 --> 00:48:48.871
<v Speaker 6>heard.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They sat that close to the TV.</v>

1095
00:48:48.871 --> 00:48:49.900
<v Speaker 6>They didn't pull it away.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Their blocks.</v>

1096
00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:52.660
<v Speaker 6>They always spilt the milk.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Those kids will not be missed.</v>

1097
00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:55.010
<v Speaker 6>And we were just going,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh no.</v>

1098
00:48:56.490 --> 00:48:58.300
<v Speaker 6>Too soon,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and he's,</v>

1099
00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:02.020
<v Speaker 6>he's just so great.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to name the comic because I</v>

1100
00:49:02.021 --> 00:49:02.170
<v Speaker 6>never</v>

1101
00:49:02.270 --> 00:49:07.270
<v Speaker 7>talk to them to confirm it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but there was a plane crash and I don't </v>

1102
00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:11.491
<v Speaker 7>know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like North Dakota or South Dakota or </v>

1103
00:49:11.491 --> 00:49:12.851
<v Speaker 7>something like that someplace and he </v>
<v Speaker 7>goes on stage like within the year and </v>

1104
00:49:12.851 --> 00:49:15.800
<v Speaker 7>it's making fun of it and some guy in </v>
<v Speaker 7>the crowd just stands up and he's like,</v>

1105
00:49:15.801 --> 00:49:19.370
<v Speaker 7>my wife was on that flight without </v>
<v Speaker 7>missing a beat.</v>

1106
00:49:19.371 --> 00:49:19.880
<v Speaker 7>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>great,</v>

1107
00:49:19.881 --> 00:49:20.990
<v Speaker 7>let's dig her up and fucker.</v>

1108
00:49:21.490 --> 00:49:26.490
<v Speaker 5>I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wow.</v>

1109
00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:32.070
<v Speaker 5>And if you're not a stand up comic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't understand that because that's</v>

1110
00:49:32.071 --> 00:49:36.810
<v Speaker 5>like literally he had to go to that </v>
<v Speaker 5>level to win because if he went,</v>

1111
00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:38.220
<v Speaker 5>because if you went like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>

1112
00:49:38.221 --> 00:49:40.730
<v Speaker 5>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She always over.</v>

1113
00:49:41.690 --> 00:49:43.110
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's up with popsicles?</v>

1114
00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:46.170
<v Speaker 5>You got it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Gets too late,</v>

1115
00:49:46.171 --> 00:49:49.050
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Turn your key on your key sir.</v>

1116
00:49:49.770 --> 00:49:51.240
<v Speaker 5>We went nuclear.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1117
00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:56.420
<v Speaker 5>that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They both had a turn to keep the same </v>

1118
00:49:56.420 --> 00:49:56.420
<v Speaker 5>time and activate the button.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1119
00:49:56.540 --> 00:49:58.160
<v Speaker 6>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fuck.</v>

1120
00:49:58.420 --> 00:49:59.800
<v Speaker 6>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1121
00:49:59.801 --> 00:50:02.190
<v Speaker 6>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fuck that guy for standing up and saying</v>

1122
00:50:02.191 --> 00:50:04.050
<v Speaker 6>that he's at a comedy show,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1123
00:50:04.410 --> 00:50:09.410
<v Speaker 6>I understand that you might think it's </v>
<v Speaker 6>offensive comments within the year if </v>

1124
00:50:09.410 --> 00:50:11.180
<v Speaker 6>you're going in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1125
00:50:11.250 --> 00:50:12.210
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Jesus Christ,</v>

1126
00:50:12.690 --> 00:50:15.110
<v Speaker 6>I wouldn't go in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I support your right to go in.</v>

1127
00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:20.120
<v Speaker 6>Just like Johnny Cash didn't really </v>
<v Speaker 6>shoot a man in Reno just to watch them </v>

1128
00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:21.360
<v Speaker 6>die.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's fucking entertainment.</v>

1129
00:50:21.361 --> 00:50:21.720
<v Speaker 6>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's,</v>

1130
00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:26.760
<v Speaker 6>he's painting a story and a guy like </v>
<v Speaker 6>Brian Holtzman isn't really happy that </v>

1131
00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:28.220
<v Speaker 6>kill white for the guy who actually</v>

1132
00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:30.680
<v Speaker 4>got shot and Reno was not in the crowd </v>
<v Speaker 4>anyway.</v>

1133
00:50:30.990 --> 00:50:31.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1134
00:50:31.711 --> 00:50:32.930
<v Speaker 1>Well that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1135
00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:35.310
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't a real event that he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>shitting on,</v>

1136
00:50:35.670 --> 00:50:38.460
<v Speaker 1>but that's part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a style of comedy that's like,</v>

1137
00:50:38.860 --> 00:50:41.640
<v Speaker 1>I love that style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like auto and George will do that.</v>

1138
00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:45.180
<v Speaker 1>Dice clay was due that date.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're over the top.</v>

1139
00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:48.090
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's something really funny about</v>

1140
00:50:48.091 --> 00:50:48.900
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love it</v>

1141
00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:53.920
<v Speaker 4>and I'm not backing down and I'm going </v>
<v Speaker 4>to say the most ridiculous outrageous </v>

1142
00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:53.920
<v Speaker 4>and it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a form of comedy.</v>

1143
00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:58.841
<v Speaker 4>You might not like it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but to sit there and then act like this </v>

1144
00:50:58.841 --> 00:51:02.321
<v Speaker 4>guy really wants to go do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it really meant it sounds </v>

1145
00:51:02.321 --> 00:51:06.060
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you take that quote and then all </v>

1146
00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:06.310
<v Speaker 4>of a sudden you put it on a new show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1147
00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:07.910
<v Speaker 4>just the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the context of it.</v>

1148
00:51:08.420 --> 00:51:10.370
<v Speaker 4>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's just like,</v>

1149
00:51:10.371 --> 00:51:15.371
<v Speaker 4>we're just taking this one line from an </v>
<v Speaker 4>hour load performance at a comedy club </v>

1150
00:51:15.371 --> 00:51:16.310
<v Speaker 4>in a different state.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1151
00:51:16.311 --> 00:51:21.311
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so funny that when there was that </v>

1152
00:51:21.311 --> 00:51:21.980
<v Speaker 4>sort of rash of those videos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the amount of times that people told the</v>

1153
00:51:21.981 --> 00:51:26.981
<v Speaker 4>joke and it killed in the club and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>they would be like controversy at the </v>

1154
00:51:26.981 --> 00:51:31.241
<v Speaker 4>laugh factory and then they cut to </v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody and they tell the joke and you </v>

1155
00:51:31.241 --> 00:51:35.141
<v Speaker 4>hear it like it's like 99 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 4>people laughed and one person gets </v>

1156
00:51:35.141 --> 00:51:35.540
<v Speaker 4>offended.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like there's no contract.</v>

1157
00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:37.870
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good joke.</v>

1158
00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:40.610
<v Speaker 1>It's a good joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1159
00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:45.710
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's an opportunity for all these </v>

1160
00:51:45.710 --> 00:51:47.641
<v Speaker 1>white knights to jump in and pretend </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're offended and pretend that you </v>

1161
00:51:47.641 --> 00:51:51.001
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to try to get feminine Brownie points </v>

1162
00:51:51.001 --> 00:51:51.001
<v Speaker 1>and step in and try to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1163
00:51:51.001 --> 00:51:51.001
<v Speaker 1>mark some notches on their side.</v>

1164
00:51:51.001 --> 00:51:53.720
<v Speaker 4>Just show up if they ever asked you to </v>
<v Speaker 4>go on TV for what?</v>

1165
00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:58.750
<v Speaker 4>If they were just like Joe Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this stuff you said are most likely no </v>

1166
00:51:58.750 --> 00:52:02.970
<v Speaker 4>take crawlspace comment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why don't you go on the Internet and on </v>

1167
00:52:02.970 --> 00:52:03.510
<v Speaker 4>TV and defend?</v>

1168
00:52:03.530 --> 00:52:05.390
<v Speaker 1>Because they would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would have control over it.</v>

1169
00:52:05.391 --> 00:52:10.391
<v Speaker 1>But I would have him come on the podcast</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I felt like someone had a rational </v>

1170
00:52:10.391 --> 00:52:10.430
<v Speaker 1>point and they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>worth debating,</v>

1171
00:52:10.670 --> 00:52:15.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe in especially if I was exploring </v>

1172
00:52:15.670 --> 00:52:15.670
<v Speaker 1>whether or not it was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I thought I might do it</v>

1173
00:52:15.770 --> 00:52:17.770
<v Speaker 4>and I would go on there and the whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>time that person was yelling,</v>

1174
00:52:17.771 --> 00:52:18.970
<v Speaker 4>I would just be hyping my dates.</v>

1175
00:52:21.610 --> 00:52:22.900
<v Speaker 1>Rutherford,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Jersey.</v>

1176
00:52:23.250 --> 00:52:28.250
<v Speaker 1>We're Jacksonville,</v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't had a piece of paper just </v>

1177
00:52:28.250 --> 00:52:29.320
<v Speaker 1>pointing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be the greatest thing.</v>

1178
00:52:29.321 --> 00:52:31.480
<v Speaker 1>Like I completely don't pick up a </v>
<v Speaker 1>calendar,</v>

1179
00:52:31.481 --> 00:52:33.340
<v Speaker 1>a large calendar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roll it out.</v>

1180
00:52:33.370 --> 00:52:35.160
<v Speaker 1>This is the bill burke calender.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look around,</v>

1181
00:52:35.290 --> 00:52:37.210
<v Speaker 1>see if I'm going to be coming to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>town billboard.com.</v>

1182
00:52:38.790 --> 00:52:41.560
<v Speaker 1>That is a good way to handle it because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it is a fucking joke.</v>

1183
00:52:41.590 --> 00:52:46.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're operating within these five </v>

1184
00:52:46.590 --> 00:52:46.590
<v Speaker 1>minute clips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going back and forth.</v>

1185
00:52:46.590 --> 00:52:50.590
<v Speaker 1>A good solid point takes a few minutes </v>
<v Speaker 1>to really establish and to give you a </v>

1186
00:52:50.881 --> 00:52:55.881
<v Speaker 1>point of view on a controversial topic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really have to cover a lot of </v>

1187
00:52:55.881 --> 00:52:55.990
<v Speaker 1>different areas and that's not what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to do.</v>

1188
00:52:55.991 --> 00:52:58.780
<v Speaker 1>They just want you to yell at you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to get you to yell at each other.</v>

1189
00:52:58.930 --> 00:53:00.970
<v Speaker 1>That would be the move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The move would be to do that.</v>

1190
00:53:00.971 --> 00:53:02.530
<v Speaker 1>Just start yelling at billboard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going</v>

1191
00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:05.030
<v Speaker 4>your dates.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just completely ignore them.</v>

1192
00:53:06.630 --> 00:53:07.960
<v Speaker 4>I'm getting good at that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1193
00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:09.860
<v Speaker 4>I had a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>had an incident,</v>

1198
00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:22.400

<v Speaker 2>so he took it to the next level when I </v>

1327
00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:37.330
<v Speaker 2>could have squashed the whole thing and </v>

<v Speaker 2>People just kind of sitting there and </v>

<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1358
00:58:45.640 --> 00:58:50.640

<v Speaker 2>Another stewardess comes over and he </v>

<v Speaker 2>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the problem?</v>

1360
00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:54.841
<v Speaker 2>And he goes through the whole fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing and it's like basically the </v>

1361
00:58:54.841 --> 00:58:55.330
<v Speaker 2>captain at this point is going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do I really have to come back there?</v>

1362
00:58:55.630 --> 00:58:57.850
<v Speaker 2>It's like really the red eye fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>flight.</v>

1363
00:58:58.150 --> 00:59:00.550
<v Speaker 2>My last flight of the day I used to fly </v>
<v Speaker 2>combat missions,</v>

1366
00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:07.300
<v Speaker 2>So I really have to come back there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they finally asked him,</v>

1367
00:59:07.301 --> 00:59:07.630
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1368
00:59:07.631 --> 00:59:09.580
<v Speaker 2>are you going to be comfortable flying </v>

<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1370
00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:15.980
<v Speaker 2>I think they acknowledged that he had </v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of something there because,</v>

1371
00:59:15.981 --> 00:59:16.380
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's gonna be okay for whatever.</v>

1373
00:59:18.550 --> 00:59:23.550
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they had some sort of something like </v>

1374
00:59:23.550 --> 00:59:23.550
<v Speaker 2>some sort of that like they checked with</v>
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>

1375
00:59:23.550 --> 00:59:25.280
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to stand down sir,</v>

1376
00:59:25.290 --> 00:59:27.800
<v Speaker 2>like whatever fucking spy he thought he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>

1377
00:59:28.130 --> 00:59:31.250
<v Speaker 2>So now we get back in line and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>taxing.</v>

1378
00:59:31.251 --> 00:59:36.251
<v Speaker 2>And as we're going down the runway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got my eye on and I'm just sitting </v>

1379
00:59:36.251 --> 00:59:38.390
<v Speaker 2>there and he's yapping in my ear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could think this is fucking over.</v>

1380
00:59:38.540 --> 00:59:40.190
<v Speaker 2>You think this is fucking over at this </v>
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>

<v Speaker 2>years old and somebody takes off the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bird head or like the big bird costume,</v>

1500
01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:44.190
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she knew I got video and I think uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I may find it on the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they,</v>

1509
01:04:56.960 --> 01:05:01.960
<v Speaker 2>The way I look at the way I would </v>
<v Speaker 2>legally argue it was legally had the </v>

1510
01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:03.420
<v Speaker 2>right to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You left the door open.</v>

<v Speaker 6>the headshot wall in Nashville,</v>

1557
01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:49.290
<v Speaker 6>one of the guys on the wall was a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

1558
01:06:49.291 --> 01:06:51.030
<v Speaker 6>there's a bunch of them that are dead </v>
<v Speaker 6>now.</v>

1559
01:06:51.260 --> 01:06:54.520
<v Speaker 6>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like tennis Wolfsburg was a beast.</v>

1560
01:06:54.990 --> 01:06:57.180
<v Speaker 6>Richard.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Jenny paintings on the wall.</v>

1561
01:06:58.740 --> 01:07:02.280
<v Speaker 6>He is one of my all time greats.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fire to pick like a 10,</v>

1562
01:07:02.310 --> 01:07:07.310
<v Speaker 6>top 10 all time and he was on that </v>
<v Speaker 6>Carlin road to where he was putting up </v>

1563
01:07:07.310 --> 01:07:08.640
<v Speaker 6>like putting them out like boom,</v>
<v Speaker 6>boom,</v>

1564
01:07:08.770 --> 01:07:09.360
<v Speaker 6>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 6>boom,</v>

1565
01:07:09.361 --> 01:07:10.230
<v Speaker 6>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like an hour,</v>

1566
01:07:10.231 --> 01:07:10.770
<v Speaker 6>another hour.</v>

1567
01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:12.540
<v Speaker 6>But unlike Carlin,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he was upset.</v>

1568
01:07:12.690 --> 01:07:15.660
<v Speaker 6>He didn't want to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He wanted to be like Jim Carrey,</v>

1569
01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:20.720
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he wanted to be a movie star and he </v>

1570
01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:22.821
<v Speaker 6>wanted to be Seinfeld.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He wanted to have his own show or </v>

1571
01:07:22.821 --> 01:07:22.821
<v Speaker 6>something,</v>
<v Speaker 6>something along those lines.</v>

1572
01:07:22.821 --> 01:07:22.821
<v Speaker 6>And it just didn't click for him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1573
01:07:22.821 --> 01:07:23.220
<v Speaker 6>he would,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1574
01:07:23.370 --> 01:07:25.080
<v Speaker 6>he would always be bummed out when he </v>
<v Speaker 6>was on the road.</v>

1575
01:07:25.081 --> 01:07:30.081
<v Speaker 6>I would always hear stories from people </v>
<v Speaker 6>that worked in clubs with them and it </v>

1576
01:07:30.081 --> 01:07:30.081
<v Speaker 6>was just unhappy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Didn't want to be on the road.</v>

1577
01:07:30.180 --> 01:07:32.110
<v Speaker 6>Me and one other guy was brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1578
01:07:32.250 --> 01:07:37.250
<v Speaker 6>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was gonna say like you can get away </v>

1579
01:07:37.250 --> 01:07:37.250
<v Speaker 6>with shit.</v>

1580
01:07:37.250 --> 01:07:37.310
<v Speaker 2>It's Kinda good to not have a TV show </v>
<v Speaker 2>once you start selling tickets.</v>

1581
01:07:37.311 --> 01:07:42.311
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I played hockey yesterday at like three </v>

1582
01:07:42.311 --> 01:07:42.311
<v Speaker 2>in the afternoon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1583
01:07:42.311 --> 01:07:42.311
<v Speaker 2>He never gonna get any fresher than </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1584
01:07:42.410 --> 01:07:44.780
<v Speaker 2>And you're going to get a show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not your show.</v>

1585
01:07:44.781 --> 01:07:47.450
<v Speaker 2>It's this show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I compare it to like when your parents,</v>

1586
01:07:47.451 --> 01:07:48.950
<v Speaker 2>when you were a kid and they gave you a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bicycle,</v>

1587
01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:51.860
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like they gave the bicycle bicycle,</v>

1588
01:07:51.861 --> 01:07:53.230
<v Speaker 2>but when you screw up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they take the book,</v>

1589
01:07:53.270 --> 01:07:54.860
<v Speaker 2>you get grounded and they take the bike </v>
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>

1590
01:07:54.890 --> 01:07:57.500
<v Speaker 2>So it's not really yours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if it's your name on it,</v>

1591
01:07:57.650 --> 01:07:58.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not an adult.</v>

1592
01:07:59.240 --> 01:07:59.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you,</v>

1593
01:07:59.970 --> 01:08:04.970
<v Speaker 2>you're going into like the matrix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I would have like a real sort of a </v>

1594
01:08:04.970 --> 01:08:09.290
<v Speaker 2>funny that I've had in this business </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I have that information now and I </v>

1595
01:08:09.290 --> 01:08:12.911
<v Speaker 2>don't know what to do with it because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like I'm going to start my own </v>

1596
01:08:12.911 --> 01:08:12.911
<v Speaker 2>network.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't know what,</v>

1597
01:08:12.911 --> 01:08:14.540
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to do anything other than</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're doing.</v>

1598
01:08:14.900 --> 01:08:16.300
<v Speaker 2>You're a great standup comedian.</v>

1599
01:08:16.330 --> 01:08:21.330
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Being a standup comic allows you to say </v>

1600
01:08:21.330 --> 01:08:21.330
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you were saying,</v>

<v Speaker 1>something fucked up because they're not </v>

1602
01:08:25.780 --> 01:08:25.940
<v Speaker 1>connecting you to a show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'd say,</v>

1603
01:08:25.970 --> 01:08:28.490

<v Speaker 1>something to do other things or is it </v>

1610
01:08:42.530 --> 01:08:42.530
<v Speaker 1>something you.</v>

1611
01:08:42.530 --> 01:08:46.700
<v Speaker 2>I want a nice run and doing some movies </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I did a couple of TV shows and it's </v>

1612
01:08:46.700 --> 01:08:50.051
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I like doing the movies because I </v>

1613
01:08:50.051 --> 01:08:50.051
<v Speaker 2>can see the light at the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>tunnel.</v>

1614
01:08:50.051 --> 01:08:50.051
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's like,</v>

1615
01:08:50.051 --> 01:08:54.971
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have you for three to six weeks or </v>

1616
01:08:54.971 --> 01:08:54.971
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

1617
01:08:54.971 --> 01:08:54.971
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1618
01:08:54.971 --> 01:08:56.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm just gonna do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to hammer this out,</v>

1619
01:08:56.031 --> 01:08:57.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to know all my lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to,</v>

1620
01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:59.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be on time and be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>professional.</v>

1621
01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:02.300
<v Speaker 2>And once I get through this then I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to uh,</v>

1622
01:09:02.450 --> 01:09:03.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the weekends,</v>

1623
01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:08.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll go out to like flappers in Burbank </v>

1624
01:09:08.430 --> 01:09:11.160
<v Speaker 2>to stay sharp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then once that's over a I go back </v>

1625
01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:11.570
<v Speaker 2>out on the road and I get going again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like the whole,</v>

1626
01:09:11.630 --> 01:09:16.630
<v Speaker 2>the idea of being on a TV show and </v>
<v Speaker 2>playing the same guy for potentially </v>

1627
01:09:16.630 --> 01:09:16.630
<v Speaker 2>five years is overwhelming to me.</v>

1628
01:09:16.630 --> 01:09:17.370
<v Speaker 2>It's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1629
01:09:17.510 --> 01:09:18.670
<v Speaker 2>It's overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I like,</v>

1630
01:09:18.860 --> 01:09:23.860
<v Speaker 2>especially like those people who do like</v>
<v Speaker 2>one camera shows like how hard they </v>

1631
01:09:23.860 --> 01:09:23.860
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they,</v>

1632
01:09:23.860 --> 01:09:26.450
<v Speaker 2>they're doing like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a 12,</v>

1633
01:09:26.451 --> 01:09:28.550
<v Speaker 2>13 hour days if you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1634
01:09:28.551 --> 01:09:29.180
<v Speaker 2>how's it going?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1635
01:09:29.181 --> 01:09:33.410
<v Speaker 2>it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cut back to one great cut.</v>

1636
01:09:33.770 --> 01:09:36.230
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know this time do it with hey,</v>

1637
01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:37.070
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1638
01:09:37.071 --> 01:09:39.140
<v Speaker 2>how's it going?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then cut.</v>

1639
01:09:39.141 --> 01:09:40.490
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>With turning it around,</v>

1640
01:09:40.491 --> 01:09:42.890
<v Speaker 2>we got to do the master and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they,</v>

1641
01:09:44.030 --> 01:09:46.610
<v Speaker 2>they work harder than I've ever worked </v>
<v Speaker 2>in my career.</v>

1642
01:09:46.790 --> 01:09:49.310
<v Speaker 2>Like standup is in real time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go on at eight,</v>

1643
01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:54.340
<v Speaker 2>do an hour and it's done in an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You shoot an hour of TV,</v>

1644
01:09:55.010 --> 01:10:00.010
<v Speaker 2>one camera and it's like you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be like those people that I have such a </v>

1645
01:10:00.010 --> 01:10:04.490
<v Speaker 2>tremendous respect for how hard people </v>
<v Speaker 2>work on those things.</v>

1646
01:10:04.491 --> 01:10:05.360
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think I have</v>

1647
01:10:05.630 --> 01:10:08.600
<v Speaker 1>ethical single camera shows what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking.</v>

1648
01:10:08.601 --> 01:10:11.030
<v Speaker 1>A lot of folks don't know the terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the business.</v>

1649
01:10:11.031 --> 01:10:16.031
<v Speaker 1>So like law and order or most dramas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sitcoms with the is they'll fit little </v>

1650
01:10:16.420 --> 01:10:19.430
<v Speaker 1>use many cameras in front of a live </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience and that's,</v>

1651
01:10:19.700 --> 01:10:21.410
<v Speaker 1>even though that's hard in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning,</v>

1652
01:10:22.860 --> 01:10:25.290
<v Speaker 1>once they get rolling then it becomes </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty easy.</v>

1653
01:10:25.350 --> 01:10:27.690
<v Speaker 1>Like when you did news radio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how soon before you guys were like,</v>

1654
01:10:27.691 --> 01:10:28.920
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't get to come in Monday.</v>

1655
01:10:29.010 --> 01:10:30.210
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever get to that point?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1656
01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:33.360
<v Speaker 1>we got to the point where sometimes we </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't come in Tuesday,</v>

1657
01:10:34.010 --> 01:10:36.900
<v Speaker 1>they come in Monday or Tuesday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do a whole show in three days because</v>

1658
01:10:36.901 --> 01:10:40.110
<v Speaker 1>they would have a problem with like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>script.</v>

1659
01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:45.360
<v Speaker 1>So it would be wrong with the script.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we would have script changes like </v>

1660
01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:47.370
<v Speaker 1>the day of like many crazy script </v>
<v Speaker 1>changes.</v>

1661
01:10:47.730 --> 01:10:49.380
<v Speaker 2>Those were the days man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if I,</v>

1662
01:10:50.820 --> 01:10:51.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1663
01:10:51.421 --> 01:10:54.240
<v Speaker 2>I wish that those things would come back</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that will really.</v>

1664
01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:56.910
<v Speaker 2>That's the dream to comes acting gig.</v>

1665
01:10:57.010 --> 01:11:02.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh it's the greatest acting Gig of all </v>

1666
01:11:02.010 --> 01:11:02.010
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But quite honestly when I did it,</v>

1667
01:11:02.010 --> 01:11:03.910
<v Speaker 1>I really appreciated Standup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1668
01:11:03.911 --> 01:11:05.890
<v Speaker 1>And when it was over I was happy it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>

1669
01:11:05.980 --> 01:11:10.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't happy because I love those </v>

1670
01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:10.980
<v Speaker 1>people that I worked with and it was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>great show,</v>

1671
01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:12.420
<v Speaker 1>but I wanted to do stand up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1672
01:11:12.430 --> 01:11:13.860
<v Speaker 1>and the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fear factor,</v>

1673
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:15.300
<v Speaker 6>fear factor,</v>
<v Speaker 6>much clear.</v>

1674
01:11:15.301 --> 01:11:19.320
<v Speaker 6>Like news radio was way more fun and </v>
<v Speaker 6>satisfying to do,</v>

1675
01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:21.060
<v Speaker 6>but same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's over.</v>

1676
01:11:21.061 --> 01:11:22.110
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>stand up.</v>

1677
01:11:22.111 --> 01:11:27.111
<v Speaker 6>It's just the best.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then now stand up at podcasting </v>

1678
01:11:27.111 --> 01:11:27.111
<v Speaker 6>together.</v>

1679
01:11:27.610 --> 01:11:31.710
<v Speaker 2>Are you going to be happier than that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would use even the UFC,</v>

1680
01:11:31.711 --> 01:11:32.360
<v Speaker 2>which is a great</v>

1681
01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:33.630
<v Speaker 6>gig.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I love the UFC,</v>

1682
01:11:33.631 --> 01:11:35.400
<v Speaker 6>but if anything ever came up with the </v>
<v Speaker 6>UFC,</v>

1683
01:11:35.450 --> 01:11:35.880
<v Speaker 6>said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>

1684
01:11:35.881 --> 01:11:37.560
<v Speaker 6>you have to choose between one or the </v>
<v Speaker 6>other.</v>

1685
01:11:37.561 --> 01:11:38.860
<v Speaker 6>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you guys take care,</v>

1686
01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:40.050
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and kind of.</v>

1687
01:11:40.100 --> 01:11:41.190
<v Speaker 6>I had a good time.</v>

1688
01:11:41.390 --> 01:11:42.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to bet on yourself.</v>

1689
01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:44.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the game.</v>

1690
01:11:44.490 --> 01:11:45.360
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only that,</v>

1691
01:11:45.630 --> 01:11:48.480
<v Speaker 2>they pull it out like a paranoid guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they fucking pull you in.</v>

1692
01:11:48.870 --> 01:11:50.100
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what it's like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I met when I would,</v>

1693
01:11:50.250 --> 01:11:55.250
<v Speaker 2>when I first came to New York City or </v>
<v Speaker 2>are they would be guys who just worked </v>

1694
01:11:55.250 --> 01:11:55.250
<v Speaker 2>one club.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1695
01:11:55.250 --> 01:11:59.720
<v Speaker 2>why would you ever do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now all you need is one falling out and </v>

1696
01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:01.000
<v Speaker 2>you have no spots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got a,</v>

1697
01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:03.960
<v Speaker 2>you got to be playing the field so they </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't,</v>

1698
01:12:03.961 --> 01:12:05.250
<v Speaker 2>they can't get you under their thumb.</v>

1699
01:12:05.420 --> 01:12:06.650
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's very important.</v>

1700
01:12:06.651 --> 01:12:11.651
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's what I would the comedy store </v>

1701
01:12:11.651 --> 01:12:11.651
<v Speaker 6>when I was living in la or when I was </v>
<v Speaker 6>working on all the time.</v>

1702
01:12:11.651 --> 01:12:14.030
<v Speaker 6>I did the comedy store every week and I </v>
<v Speaker 6>didn't do anything else.</v>

1703
01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:16.940
<v Speaker 6>I very rarely did anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like sometimes I did.</v>

1704
01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:19.670
<v Speaker 6>Thanks buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sometimes I did the uh,</v>

1705
01:12:19.671 --> 01:12:24.671
<v Speaker 6>the Improv,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like for New Year's or something like </v>

1706
01:12:24.671 --> 01:12:26.861
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but almost every weekend I was at the </v>

1707
01:12:26.861 --> 01:12:26.861
<v Speaker 6>store and then when I had that falling </v>
<v Speaker 6>out with the store I was like,</v>

1708
01:12:26.861 --> 01:12:27.700
<v Speaker 6>what am I doing?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like why,</v>

1709
01:12:27.701 --> 01:12:31.490
<v Speaker 6>why would I allow them to have any power</v>
<v Speaker 6>over where I work or don't work?</v>

1710
01:12:31.491 --> 01:12:34.140
<v Speaker 6>Like fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1711
01:12:34.190 --> 01:12:37.820
<v Speaker 6>I think that's a good mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so sometimes it can hurt you though.</v>

1712
01:12:37.940 --> 01:12:42.940
<v Speaker 6>Tim Allen stopped doing stand up when he</v>
<v Speaker 6>was doing home improvement because he </v>

1713
01:12:42.940 --> 01:12:43.360
<v Speaker 6>had that like real.</v>

<v Speaker 6>I thought he was not blue,</v>

1718
01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:57.570
<v Speaker 6>but potentially controversial.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:11.130
<v Speaker 2>who gets to the point where they just </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

1726
01:13:11.170 --> 01:13:13.170
<v Speaker 2>I just don't want to go on the road </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

1727
01:13:13.380 --> 01:13:16.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy with the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1728
01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:18.840
<v Speaker 2>writing on a show like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I totally get that.</v>

1729
01:13:18.870 --> 01:13:20.550
<v Speaker 2>Like if it's all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what it is,</v>

1730
01:13:21.510 --> 01:13:25.110
<v Speaker 2>it's like none of it is selling out if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're okay with it.</v>

1731
01:13:25.260 --> 01:13:26.440
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the other thing?</v>

1732
01:13:26.441 --> 01:13:27.330
<v Speaker 2>Selling out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1733
01:13:27.331 --> 01:13:28.620
<v Speaker 2>it's an internal thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>

1734
01:13:28.621 --> 01:13:30.870
<v Speaker 2>it's not other people saying it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's literally like,</v>

1735
01:13:31.170 --> 01:13:35.160
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're not okay with it and you do it</v>

1736
01:13:35.161 --> 01:13:37.650
<v Speaker 2>anyways because of the money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're selling out.</v>

1737
01:13:37.651 --> 01:13:39.540
<v Speaker 2>But if you're alright with it and be </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1738
01:13:39.541 --> 01:13:40.470
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm married now.</v>

1739
01:13:40.471 --> 01:13:43.470
<v Speaker 2>I got a couple of kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is an easy act acting gig.</v>

1740
01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:46.560
<v Speaker 2>I can be here when my kids grow up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's not selling out.</v>

1741
01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:48.780
<v Speaker 2>It really isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think anyway.</v>

1742
01:13:48.930 --> 01:13:53.930
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the only thing that's selling out is if </v>

1743
01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:53.930
<v Speaker 6>you stop doing what you want to do as </v>
<v Speaker 6>well.</v>

1744
01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:54.870
<v Speaker 6>Like if they come up to you and say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Bill,</v>

1745
01:13:54.871 --> 01:13:55.680
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1746
01:13:55.700 --> 01:14:00.700
<v Speaker 6>we,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we really liked the way you play drums </v>

1747
01:14:00.700 --> 01:14:00.700
<v Speaker 6>and we want you in the band.</v>
<v Speaker 6>God,</v>

1748
01:14:00.700 --> 01:14:03.830
<v Speaker 6>I wish that would happened,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but no talking no more talking for you.</v>

1749
01:14:04.130 --> 01:14:06.240
<v Speaker 6>You say you wish that would happen,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you wouldn't be able to.</v>

1750
01:14:06.530 --> 01:14:08.140
<v Speaker 2>I would just love somebody to compliment</v>
<v Speaker 2>my drama.</v>

1751
01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:12.730
<v Speaker 2>You always want to come like compliments</v>
<v Speaker 2>on your hobby.</v>

1752
01:14:13.010 --> 01:14:14.110
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so much better.</v>

1753
01:14:14.410 --> 01:14:15.610
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you say a dentist?</v>

1754
01:14:15.750 --> 01:14:16.740
<v Speaker 2>Damn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a good dentist.</v>

1755
01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:22.200
<v Speaker 2>Done a million of these.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you actually just sit there and </v>

1756
01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:22.200
<v Speaker 2>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why did you build those cabinets?</v>

1757
01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:22.200
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>matter of fact,</v>

1758
01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:25.180
<v Speaker 2>I did so true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing that you know,</v>

1759
01:14:25.181 --> 01:14:25.900
<v Speaker 2>you suck at,</v>

1760
01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:28.440
<v Speaker 6>it's so true.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like my pool plane,</v>

1761
01:14:28.660 --> 01:14:30.460
<v Speaker 6>that's probably the worst thing that I </v>
<v Speaker 6>do.</v>

1762
01:14:30.610 --> 01:14:32.440
<v Speaker 6>But if someone compliments me on my </v>
<v Speaker 6>pipeline,</v>

1763
01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:33.490
<v Speaker 6>good pool player,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I am,</v>

1764
01:14:33.491 --> 01:14:37.150
<v Speaker 6>but I'm not a good pool player for pro.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If I was a professional,</v>

1765
01:14:37.390 --> 01:14:42.390
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so for a regular person and they're </v>

1766
01:14:42.390 --> 01:14:42.390
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Whoa,</v>

1767
01:14:42.390 --> 01:14:42.390
<v Speaker 6>fucking Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What are you?</v>

1768
01:14:42.390 --> 01:14:43.990
<v Speaker 6>A professional.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But a professional said,</v>

1769
01:14:44.020 --> 01:14:45.250
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you play good.</v>

1770
01:14:45.251 --> 01:14:46.600
<v Speaker 6>See,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's why you're so successful.</v>

1771
01:14:46.810 --> 01:14:51.810
<v Speaker 6>You're trying to get.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You just don't want to like be able to </v>

1772
01:14:51.810 --> 01:14:51.960
<v Speaker 6>beat the guys down at the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1773
01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:53.230
<v Speaker 6>Dave and busters or whatever</v>

1774
01:14:54.820 --> 01:14:55.420
<v Speaker 2>round,</v>
<v Speaker 2>round,</v>

1775
01:14:56.410 --> 01:14:56.980
<v Speaker 2>round,</v>
<v Speaker 2>round.</v>

1776
01:14:57.880 --> 01:15:02.530
<v Speaker 2>Round was always bummed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They never showed the Regal Beagle.</v>

1777
01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:03.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck?</v>

1778
01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:05.980
<v Speaker 2>They can't have another set.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about your anniversary?</v>

1779
01:15:08.350 --> 01:15:13.350
<v Speaker 2>I want to see upstairs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking three's company for the </v>

1780
01:15:13.350 --> 01:15:14.200
<v Speaker 2>youngsters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Larry upstairs was crushing it.</v>

1781
01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:16.600
<v Speaker 2>That guy was probably the first herpes </v>
<v Speaker 2>case.</v>

1782
01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:21.250
<v Speaker 2>What I love about him was he was just so</v>
<v Speaker 2>crushed and ass and didn't,</v>

1783
01:15:21.490 --> 01:15:26.490
<v Speaker 2>didn't Karen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the character was not considered a </v>

1784
01:15:26.490 --> 01:15:26.490
<v Speaker 2>fence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that guy exists.</v>

1785
01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:30.460
<v Speaker 2>That's the guy who's never in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship and he's just,</v>

1786
01:15:30.470 --> 01:15:33.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chest hair going was the early eighties,</v>

1787
01:15:33.761 --> 01:15:34.600
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't it?</v>

1788
01:15:34.900 --> 01:15:37.450
<v Speaker 2>Late seventies and early eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Late seventies,</v>

1789
01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:39.070
<v Speaker 2>early eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that show.</v>

1790
01:15:39.190 --> 01:15:41.920
<v Speaker 2>It's a great show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were both hot.</v>

1791
01:15:41.950 --> 01:15:43.750
<v Speaker 2>Chrissy and Janet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about the middle one?</v>

1792
01:15:43.780 --> 01:15:46.120
<v Speaker 2>I had no problem with any of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which Chrissy was your favorite?</v>

1793
01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:47.920
<v Speaker 2>The first one?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first one?</v>

1794
01:15:47.921 --> 01:15:48.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>that sound like a perfect.</v>

1797
01:15:54.210 --> 01:15:55.840
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that nobody threw anything at me.</v>

1798
01:15:56.210 --> 01:16:00.370
<v Speaker 2>Seems like she'd be fun to do things to </v>
<v Speaker 2>cook with her.</v>

1799
01:16:02.430 --> 01:16:04.130
<v Speaker 6>She,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she's a perfect,</v>

1800
01:16:04.150 --> 01:16:09.150
<v Speaker 6>like almost like the quintessential </v>
<v Speaker 6>story of someone getting too big for </v>

1801
01:16:09.150 --> 01:16:11.760
<v Speaker 6>their britches and fucking up in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>Hollywood though because she was on this</v>

1802
01:16:11.761 --> 01:16:16.410
<v Speaker 6>massive hit show and she demanded so </v>
<v Speaker 6>much like her management and whatever.</v>

1803
01:16:16.411 --> 01:16:21.411
<v Speaker 6>They were trying to squeeze every ounce </v>
<v Speaker 6>of blood out of the next pharaoh.</v>

1804
01:16:22.020 --> 01:16:24.400
<v Speaker 6>So the show like locked her out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like they're like,</v>

1805
01:16:24.420 --> 01:16:25.860
<v Speaker 6>oh yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 6>episodes where she would call in.</v>

1807
01:16:29.370 --> 01:16:31.830
<v Speaker 6>Like Chrissy would call in like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hey guys,</v>

<v Speaker 6>how you been?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like they funded.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Oh they must have had so much fun.</v>

1810
01:16:35.970 --> 01:16:37.440
<v Speaker 6>And they got.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They just got rid of her.</v>

1811
01:16:38.050 --> 01:16:38.590
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

1815
01:16:47.050 --> 01:16:52.050
<v Speaker 6>She's pretty hot,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I don't think she had legs like </v>

1816
01:16:52.050 --> 01:16:52.080
<v Speaker 6>women's sheriff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She did that for a minute.</v>

1922
01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:22.601
<v Speaker 2>she was in where she's naked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she's sitting with her knees up so </v>

01:21:22.601 --> 01:21:22.601
<v Speaker 2>you can't see anything but you almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't.</v>

1924
01:21:22.601 --> 01:21:25.940
<v Speaker 2>I think I was like maybe eight years old</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was looking through it and I think</v>

1925
01:21:25.941 --> 01:21:27.800
<v Speaker 2>it was the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1926
01:21:27.801 --> 01:21:30.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't know anything about my body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I had an orgasm,</v>

1927
01:21:30.021 --> 01:21:31.880
<v Speaker 2>but nothing came out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember I was looking,</v>

1928
01:21:31.881 --> 01:21:33.800
<v Speaker 2>I was looking at the picture and I just </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of went.</v>

1929
01:21:33.801 --> 01:21:37.490
<v Speaker 2>I went like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that brief thing,</v>

1930
01:21:37.491 --> 01:21:42.491
<v Speaker 2>and I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I hate the fact Teresa </v>

1931
01:21:42.491 --> 01:21:46.880
<v Speaker 2>stories talking about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like don't you love to be able to go </v>

1932
01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:49.241
<v Speaker 2>back to that innocent where you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>look at like a Jordan marsh catalog and </v>

1933
01:21:49.241 --> 01:21:52.331
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my some secretary skirt below blower </v>

1934
01:21:52.631 --> 01:21:55.280
<v Speaker 2>knees and just their calves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't believe it.</v>

1935
01:21:55.281 --> 01:21:57.690
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine touching a woman's calves.</v>

1936
01:21:57.691 --> 01:22:00.290
<v Speaker 2>Like you just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just never have that innocence.</v>

1937
01:22:00.660 --> 01:22:01.990
<v Speaker 2>Well again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>

1938
01:22:02.010 --> 01:22:06.510
<v Speaker 6>But guys who don't get laid,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they sort of have that in real life with</v>

1939
01:22:06.511 --> 01:22:07.870
<v Speaker 6>girls.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1940
01:22:07.930 --> 01:22:11.090
<v Speaker 6>when they see a real girl in real life </v>
<v Speaker 6>that you know,</v>

1941
01:22:11.130 --> 01:22:14.400
<v Speaker 6>at work or at the gym or something like </v>
<v Speaker 6>that where it's almost like,</v>

1942
01:22:14.410 --> 01:22:15.720
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>can't believe she's right there.</v>

1943
01:22:16.710 --> 01:22:18.350
<v Speaker 6>But if you get laid,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's just like up yet,</v>

1944
01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:19.920
<v Speaker 6>that's a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She probably wanted me fuck her,</v>

1945
01:22:19.921 --> 01:22:20.820
<v Speaker 6>but okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Whatever.</v>

1946
01:22:20.860 --> 01:22:21.730
<v Speaker 2>Do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was a virgin,</v>

1947
01:22:21.731 --> 01:22:24.310
<v Speaker 2>when a good looking girl talk to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my face turned red.</v>

1948
01:22:26.090 --> 01:22:31.090
<v Speaker 2>Like it was so overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you didn't even know what to do.</v>

1949
01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:32.410
<v Speaker 2>You're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God.</v>

1950
01:22:32.411 --> 01:22:36.370
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't even know how my body's not</v>
<v Speaker 2>even functioning coco cafe.</v>

1951
01:22:36.371 --> 01:22:40.530
<v Speaker 2>This tastes like the milk at the end of </v>
<v Speaker 2>cocoa puffs on it.</v>

1952
01:22:40.620 --> 01:22:42.550
<v Speaker 2>And we'll talk in the seventies.</v>

01:26:35.051 --> 01:26:40.051
<v Speaker 6>man versus a $7,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 6>man is one of the most ridiculous </v>

2058
01:26:40.051 --> 01:26:41.110
<v Speaker 6>fucking things.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I sat down and pajamas.</v>

2059
01:26:41.150 --> 01:26:46.150
<v Speaker 6>It's sitting on a beanbag.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Watching that on one of those TV with </v>

2060
01:26:46.150 --> 01:26:47.710
<v Speaker 6>legs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just riveted.</v>

2061
01:26:47.950 --> 01:26:50.290
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they were racing the $7,000,000</v>

2062
01:26:50.291 --> 01:26:55.291
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just slightly ahead of him in the </v>

2063
01:26:55.291 --> 01:26:55.291
<v Speaker 6>race,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they're both white,</v>

2064
01:26:55.291 --> 01:26:58.800
<v Speaker 6>so during the race everything has to be </v>
<v Speaker 6>in slow motion because otherwise you </v>

2065
01:26:58.800 --> 01:26:59.590
<v Speaker 6>wouldn't be able to realize how </v>
<v Speaker 6>ridiculous it wasn't.</v>

2066

<v Speaker 6>were special at.</v>

2079
01:27:30.650 --> 01:27:35.650
<v Speaker 2>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is in a very rare space where he was </v>

2080
01:27:35.650 --> 01:27:37.320
<v Speaker 2>on three shows that all went to </v>
<v Speaker 2>syndication.</v>

2081
01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:39.820
<v Speaker 2>Syndication.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was on the big valley,</v>

2082
01:27:40.210 --> 01:27:42.640
<v Speaker 2>played a cowboy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did the $6,000,000</v>

2083
01:27:42.641 --> 01:27:45.140
<v Speaker 2>man and then he did the fall guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2084
01:27:45.250 --> 01:27:47.020
<v Speaker 2>and they all went.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2085
01:27:47.021 --> 01:27:48.190
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Heather locklear.</v>

2086
01:27:48.191 --> 01:27:52.410
<v Speaker 2>I think might have had four different </v>
<v Speaker 2>shows that want to syndicate.</v>

2087
01:27:52.570 --> 01:27:57.570
<v Speaker 2>That went five years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they literally like good luck </v>

2088
01:27:57.570 --> 01:27:59.941
<v Speaker 2>charm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's just like we got to get this </v>

2089
01:27:59.941 --> 01:27:59.941
<v Speaker 2>person in this show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's gonna.</v>

2090
01:27:59.941 --> 01:28:00.160
<v Speaker 2>It's gonna go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done.</v>

<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2092
01:28:01.801 --> 01:28:03.130
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He fought a guy with black hair.</v>

2093
01:28:03.190 --> 01:28:06.130
<v Speaker 6>This is a different guy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe this is the first $7,000,000</v>

2094
01:28:06.131 --> 01:28:07.810
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe there's more than one.</v>

2095
01:28:07.990 --> 01:28:09.790
<v Speaker 6>I've been on two shows that have been </v>
<v Speaker 6>syndication.</v>

2096
01:28:11.620 --> 01:28:12.620
<v Speaker 6>I got lucky.</v>

<v Speaker 6>one more and then you're in that </v>

<v Speaker 6>rarefied air.</v>

<v Speaker 6>you'll do it?</v>

2100
01:28:18.850 --> 01:28:20.230
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think so.</v>

2101
01:28:20.260 --> 01:28:21.880
<v Speaker 6>I think I'm done.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think this,</v>

2102
01:28:21.970 --> 01:28:26.970
<v Speaker 6>this is in syndication already already.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Or wondering what kind of show could </v>

2103
01:28:27.371 --> 01:28:29.320
<v Speaker 6>they learn you back?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm doing a new thing.</v>

2104
01:28:29.321 --> 01:28:31.500
<v Speaker 6>I'm not supposed to talk about it </v>
<v Speaker 6>because I did talk about it and they go.</v>

2105
01:28:31.700 --> 01:28:33.480
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But um,</v>

2106
01:28:33.890 --> 01:28:38.890
<v Speaker 6>that's the new thing is it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's crafty.</v>

2107
01:28:39.190 --> 01:28:44.190
<v Speaker 6>It's going to be fun,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's a lot of things based on skin </v>

2108
01:28:44.190 --> 01:28:47.070
<v Speaker 6>grafts show.</v>
<v Speaker 6>After that kind of crafty you make </v>

2109
01:28:47.740 --> 01:28:51.850
<v Speaker 6>little octagon with based on lighthouse </v>
<v Speaker 6>Ufo and big foot and shit.</v>

2110
01:28:52.650 --> 01:28:57.650
<v Speaker 2>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think about that Garrett </v>

2111
01:28:57.650 --> 01:28:57.650
<v Speaker 2>guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fighter that has down syndrome,</v>

2112
01:28:57.650 --> 01:29:01.280
<v Speaker 2>they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've been like showing him on espn </v>

2113
01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:01.620
<v Speaker 2>like crazy and at first I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of up,</v>

2114
01:29:01.621 --> 01:29:03.730
<v Speaker 2>but he's actually pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you.</v>

2115
01:29:03.870 --> 01:29:08.870
<v Speaker 6>I haven't seen too much about it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've avoided it with because I'm </v>

2116
01:29:08.870 --> 01:29:09.930
<v Speaker 6>terrified that somehow or another it </v>
<v Speaker 6>would make it into my act.</v>

2117
01:29:10.050 --> 01:29:15.050
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then what about him fighting the </v>

2118
01:29:15.050 --> 01:29:18.531
<v Speaker 6>transgender?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think the transgender women like men </v>

2119
01:29:18.531 --> 01:29:22.371
<v Speaker 6>to women should fight transgender women </v>
<v Speaker 6>to men and we'll see what's the better </v>

2120
01:29:22.371 --> 01:29:22.371
<v Speaker 6>combination</v>

2121
01:29:22.371 --> 01:29:25.850
<v Speaker 2>societies should be more acceptable and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then we'll create a whole new class.</v>

2122
01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:27.770
<v Speaker 6>Trent 20 fights.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2123
01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:30.960
<v Speaker 6>You're not supposed to even say tranny.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you know you'll have if</v>

2124
01:29:31.940 --> 01:29:36.940
<v Speaker 5>champion fighting out of the blue </v>
<v Speaker 5>corner.</v>

2125
01:29:40.590 --> 01:29:42.290
<v Speaker 5>There used to be a dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now he's a chair.</v>

2126
01:29:45.190 --> 01:29:47.450
<v Speaker 5>This guy you said he's good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2127
01:29:47.451 --> 01:29:47.860
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2128
01:29:48.650 --> 01:29:49.820
<v Speaker 5>the only thing though,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

2129
01:29:50.200 --> 01:29:54.820
<v Speaker 2>I don't like to just like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>transgender lady thing,</v>

2130
01:29:55.570 --> 01:29:58.660
<v Speaker 2>like you don't know if he's 100 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2131
01:29:58.730 --> 01:30:01.240
<v Speaker 2>like should he be able to fight regular </v>
<v Speaker 2>people?</v>

2132
01:30:01.241 --> 01:30:01.740
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>

2134
01:30:03.770 --> 01:30:04.400
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2135
01:30:04.570 --> 01:30:07.200
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in this video that's a,</v>

2136
01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:10.480
<v Speaker 2>you can find on espn.go.com</v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

2137
01:30:10.500 --> 01:30:12.490
<v Speaker 2>I think he actually fights in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>video.</v>

2138
01:30:12.510 --> 01:30:13.880
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

2141
01:30:18.830 --> 01:30:23.830
<v Speaker 2>this is why I can't watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just immediately start thinking of bits </v>

2142
01:30:23.830 --> 01:30:24.970
<v Speaker 2>and she's not in the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's just commentating scar right here.</v>

2143
01:30:25.150 --> 01:30:30.150
<v Speaker 2>Get out of the fight but a duty look at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got a black eye and stuff did that </v>

2144
01:30:30.701 --> 01:30:32.500
<v Speaker 2>to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy right here,</v>

2145
01:30:32.680 --> 01:30:34.030
<v Speaker 2>this is what's going on right here.</v>

2146
01:30:34.130 --> 01:30:34.680
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>

2147
01:30:34.681 --> 01:30:39.681
<v Speaker 6>So he got fucking power doubled quick.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well I would think that his reaction </v>

2148
01:30:39.681 --> 01:30:42.610
<v Speaker 6>time would be not so good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2149
01:30:43.390 --> 01:30:46.200
<v Speaker 2>I would be concerned that you're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2150
01:30:46.210 --> 01:30:47.860
<v Speaker 2>he'd be do more damage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't,</v>

2151
01:30:47.861 --> 01:30:48.480
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2152
01:30:48.490 --> 01:30:50.260
<v Speaker 2>no it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Dr.</v>

2153
01:30:50.350 --> 01:30:52.030
<v Speaker 2>Berg here thinks that,</v>

2154
01:30:53.580 --> 01:30:55.170
<v Speaker 6>I mean it is something to consider.</v>

2155
01:30:56.720 --> 01:30:59.870
<v Speaker 2>You just got to be another kid out there</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the same thing and then they can go</v>

2156
01:30:59.871 --> 01:31:01.030
<v Speaker 2>at it and he got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He Kinda,</v>

2157
01:31:01.060 --> 01:31:02.150
<v Speaker 2>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't,</v>

2158
01:31:02.720 --> 01:31:03.470
<v Speaker 2>you can't do this.</v>

2159
01:31:03.610 --> 01:31:08.260
<v Speaker 6>They're finding so much fucked up about.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He got manhandled man.</v>

2160
01:31:08.560 --> 01:31:10.630
<v Speaker 6>You could see like the way that guy </v>
<v Speaker 6>threw him to the ground,</v>

2161
01:31:10.631 --> 01:31:13.650
<v Speaker 6>like as a good grappler.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think um,</v>

2162
01:31:13.930 --> 01:31:14.440
<v Speaker 6>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's,</v>

2163
01:31:14.620 --> 01:31:19.620
<v Speaker 6>they're showing a lot of studies now </v>
<v Speaker 6>more than ever about brain damage and </v>

2164
01:31:19.620 --> 01:31:22.390
<v Speaker 6>fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And if you already have an issue,</v>

2165
01:31:22.391 --> 01:31:23.710
<v Speaker 6>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would say like,</v>

2166
01:31:23.950 --> 01:31:25.560
<v Speaker 6>just get involved in Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Go,</v>

2167
01:31:25.600 --> 01:31:28.270
<v Speaker 6>go grapple.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You really want to train and compete.</v>

2168
01:31:28.540 --> 01:31:29.990
<v Speaker 6>Jujitsu is fine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can,</v>

2169
01:31:30.020 --> 01:31:35.020
<v Speaker 6>you can have like really intense high </v>
<v Speaker 6>level competition and you don't get hit </v>

2170
01:31:35.020 --> 01:31:38.410
<v Speaker 6>in the head getting hit in the head band</v>
<v Speaker 6>unless you want to fight for a living,</v>

2171
01:31:38.411 --> 01:31:40.510
<v Speaker 6>unless you want to be a professional </v>
<v Speaker 6>fighter.</v>

2172
01:31:40.990 --> 01:31:43.030
<v Speaker 6>I don't advise getting hit in the head </v>
<v Speaker 6>at all,</v>

2173
01:31:44.590 --> 01:31:46.510
<v Speaker 6>but it's good to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's good to train.</v>

2174
01:31:46.750 --> 01:31:51.750
<v Speaker 6>And if you can learn from people that </v>
<v Speaker 6>you trust when you don't hit each other </v>

2175
01:31:51.750 --> 01:31:55.591
<v Speaker 6>full blast,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like you kick hard to the body and to </v>

2176
01:31:55.591 --> 01:31:56.590
<v Speaker 6>the head and you just punched like soft </v>
<v Speaker 6>to the face.</v>

2177
01:31:57.050 --> 01:32:00.010
<v Speaker 6>They say that guy is a monster tattoo </v>
<v Speaker 6>monster energy todd to</v>

2178
01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:01.240
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>

2179
01:32:01.241 --> 01:32:06.241
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they're pretty much evenly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>evenly matched because it's shitty </v>

2180
01:32:06.241 --> 01:32:07.670
<v Speaker 1>choices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2181
01:32:07.680 --> 01:32:09.930
<v Speaker 1>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2182
01:32:09.940 --> 01:32:11.560
<v Speaker 1>it looks like he was all happy that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>fought.</v>

2183
01:32:11.590 --> 01:32:12.490
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2184
01:32:12.491 --> 01:32:14.350
<v Speaker 1>he can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't take that away from him.</v>

2185
01:32:14.580 --> 01:32:19.050
<v Speaker 1>Just the problem with fighting is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>real problem is that you're,</v>

2186
01:32:19.070 --> 01:32:20.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2187
01:32:20.710 --> 01:32:25.710
<v Speaker 1>you're fighting on credit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're essentially finding on brand </v>

2188
01:32:25.710 --> 01:32:27.920
<v Speaker 1>credits and are you willing to go out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and throw them in and you know and</v>

2189
01:32:27.940 --> 01:32:29.890
<v Speaker 1>see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you're getting tagged,</v>

2190
01:32:29.891 --> 01:32:31.900
<v Speaker 1>you owe that later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You owe that.</v>

2191
01:32:31.901 --> 01:32:33.810
<v Speaker 1>It's going to come back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to come back with interest.</v>

2192
01:32:33.811 --> 01:32:38.811
<v Speaker 1>Am I come back six years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five years from now I've met guys </v>

2193
01:32:38.811 --> 01:32:43.140
<v Speaker 1>knowing them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing them when they were fine and </v>

2194
01:32:43.140 --> 01:32:43.140
<v Speaker 1>then seeing them fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not just one.</v>

2195
01:32:43.710 --> 01:32:47.640
<v Speaker 1>It's weird to see when you know a guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>for 10 years and then you talked to him,</v>

2196
01:32:47.670 --> 01:32:49.990
<v Speaker 1>you see him like looking around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't know where he is.</v>

2197
01:32:50.100 --> 01:32:53.110
<v Speaker 1>He's fucking slurring his words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like was hammered.</v>

2198
01:32:53.350 --> 01:32:57.610
<v Speaker 1>It's weird because the sound drunk </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it'll sound like a drunk.</v>

2199
01:32:57.850 --> 01:33:00.010
<v Speaker 1>Like that's how they sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They sound like a guy who's just.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2201
01:33:01.750 --> 01:33:03.340
<v Speaker 1>And it's just from taking shots.</v>

2202

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They say like nfl football,</v>

01:33:06.410 --> 01:33:09.050
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's people predicting that it's just</v>

2204
01:33:09.080 --> 01:33:14.080
<v Speaker 4>going to not exist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like at least in the form I have the </v>

2205
01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:15.830
<v Speaker 4>solution you got.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got to go back to leather helmets.</v>

2206

2207
01:33:20.831 --> 01:33:20.831
<v Speaker 4>all the equipment now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean this isn't like,</v>

2208
01:33:20.831 --> 01:33:25.720
<v Speaker 4>this is like A.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm Don Cherry talked about that in the </v>

2209
01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:26.780
<v Speaker 4>NHL.</v>

<v Speaker 4>when you played hockey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2211
01:33:28.220 --> 01:33:33.220
<v Speaker 4>just get the pads I used to wear when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you played sports now they like this </v>

2212
01:33:33.220 --> 01:33:36.500
<v Speaker 4>hard plastic and I just took up the game</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's like dude,</v>

2213
01:33:36.700 --> 01:33:38.780
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've fallen on the ice with nothing.</v>

2214
01:33:39.260 --> 01:33:41.840
<v Speaker 4>And if you feel like in my age I get hit</v>
<v Speaker 4>by a truck,</v>

2215
01:33:42.020 --> 01:33:42.990
<v Speaker 4>you get all the equipment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All,</v>

2216
01:33:42.991 --> 01:33:43.880
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's hilarious.</v>

2217
01:33:43.940 --> 01:33:45.980
<v Speaker 4>It's just you like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll feel like your Robo cop,</v>

2218
01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:48.560
<v Speaker 4>you just fall down and nothing hurts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now you get these guys.</v>

2219
01:33:48.561 --> 01:33:52.070
<v Speaker 4>Were they how fast they can skate like </v>
<v Speaker 4>25 miles an hour or something.</v>

2220
01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:55.010
<v Speaker 4>And they come by and they catch you with</v>
<v Speaker 4>that hard piece of plastic.</v>

2221
01:33:55.011 --> 01:33:57.440
<v Speaker 4>It's like getting hit with a wrench.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I saw a guy,</v>

2222
01:33:57.441 --> 01:34:00.740
<v Speaker 4>a mark severity got hit as he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>falling through on a shot,</v>

2223
01:34:00.741 --> 01:34:04.490
<v Speaker 4>got hit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He spun around 180 degrees and came back</v>

2224
01:34:04.491 --> 01:34:07.970
<v Speaker 4>and he's never been back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One hit really?</v>

2225
01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:08.930
<v Speaker 4>One hit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah Dude.</v>

2226
01:34:08.931 --> 01:34:09.200
<v Speaker 4>I mean</v>

2227
01:34:09.230 --> 01:34:10.730
<v Speaker 1>it hasn't been back Canon</v>

2228
01:34:10.780 --> 01:34:14.680
<v Speaker 4>right in the jaw.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he spun around like obviously got an</v>

2229
01:34:14.740 --> 01:34:15.780
<v Speaker 4>A.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2230
01:34:15.860 --> 01:34:18.340
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shit like a high level concussion.</v>

2231
01:34:18.341 --> 01:34:20.630
<v Speaker 4>He was a phenomenal player.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

2232
01:34:21.100 --> 01:34:26.100
<v Speaker 4>so people are saying we got to go back </v>
<v Speaker 4>to that because I like the pad you had </v>

2233
01:34:26.951 --> 01:34:28.900
<v Speaker 4>when you were younger,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you hit stuff,</v>

2234
01:34:28.901 --> 01:34:30.700
<v Speaker 4>you still felt it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

2235
01:34:30.701 --> 01:34:32.300
<v Speaker 4>And then the pads would start to wear </v>
<v Speaker 4>out,</v>

2236
01:34:32.350 --> 01:34:33.520
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>towards the season,</v>

2237
01:34:33.521 --> 01:34:34.660
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it would hurt.</v>

2238
01:34:34.661 --> 01:34:36.970
<v Speaker 4>But now it's just like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this stuff,</v>

2239
01:34:37.390 --> 01:34:41.250
<v Speaker 4>it's so incredible if like I play </v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously non contact,</v>

2240
01:34:41.380 --> 01:34:43.150
<v Speaker 4>so it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you fall down,</v>

2241
01:34:43.151 --> 01:34:45.750
<v Speaker 4>you don't hurt yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>

2242
01:34:46.890 --> 01:34:49.360
<v Speaker 4>the stuff in like the Nhl they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about that they're talking about</v>

2243
01:34:49.361 --> 01:34:52.360
<v Speaker 4>like in the NFL,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like having guys starting from like sort</v>

2244
01:34:52.361 --> 01:34:54.910
<v Speaker 4>of like a stand up position with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>hands out because they,</v>

2245
01:34:54.911 --> 01:34:58.000
<v Speaker 4>every place I cannot bone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're just slamming heads together.</v>

2246
01:34:58.490 --> 01:35:01.360
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>repeatedly when you play the whole game,</v>

2247
01:35:01.780 --> 01:35:03.940
<v Speaker 4>you got like whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

2248
01:35:03.941 --> 01:35:05.290
<v Speaker 4>40,</v>
<v Speaker 4>50 plays,</v>

2249
01:35:05.680 --> 01:35:08.440
<v Speaker 4>you slammed your head into another guy's</v>
<v Speaker 4>had 50 times,</v>

2250
01:35:08.470 --> 01:35:11.920
<v Speaker 4>just that game and then you play 16 </v>
<v Speaker 4>games.</v>

2251
01:35:13.180 --> 01:35:18.180
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now this is beyond my fucking </v>

2252
01:35:18.180 --> 01:35:18.180
<v Speaker 4>capabilities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>16 Times</v>

2253
01:35:18.180 --> 01:35:18.180
<v Speaker 5>anyway.</v>

2254
01:35:19.820 --> 01:35:21.280
<v Speaker 6>You're getting hit in the head a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2255
01:35:21.430 --> 01:35:22.840
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

2256
01:35:22.841 --> 01:35:25.560
<v Speaker 6>People are realizing that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2257
01:35:25.561 --> 01:35:27.010
<v Speaker 6>when,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when football came around,</v>

2258
01:35:27.011 --> 01:35:32.011
<v Speaker 6>when it became popular,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the amount of data that they had on </v>

2259
01:35:32.011 --> 01:35:33.130
<v Speaker 6>brain trauma and to what they have </v>
<v Speaker 6>today,</v>

2260
01:35:33.131 --> 01:35:34.990
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's pretty minimal.</v>

2261
01:35:35.230 --> 01:35:40.230
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>now we have a sort of accurate view of </v>

2262
01:35:40.230 --> 01:35:40.230
<v Speaker 6>the landscape and we know like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

2263
01:35:40.230 --> 01:35:40.930
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're taking a fucking serious chances,</v>

2264
01:35:40.931 --> 01:35:41.040
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2265
01:35:41.660 --> 01:35:43.000
<v Speaker 4>The helmet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What it does is it really,</v>

2266
01:35:43.010 --> 01:35:47.690
<v Speaker 4>it protects beyond a certain hit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All it's doing is protecting the skull.</v>

2267
01:35:47.691 --> 01:35:52.691
<v Speaker 4>You won't get a dented skull but like </v>
<v Speaker 4>your brain is just getting sloshed </v>

2268
01:35:52.691 --> 01:35:55.640
<v Speaker 4>around so somebody has to come up with </v>
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

2269
01:35:56.300 --> 01:35:59.270
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how big would that be or it</v>
<v Speaker 4>can kinda like,</v>

2270
01:35:59.510 --> 01:36:01.280
<v Speaker 4>like your head just sits in there and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you just</v>

2271
01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:03.140
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the hellman moves around.</v>

2272
01:36:03.590 --> 01:36:05.000
<v Speaker 4>Do you know what video I watched </v>
<v Speaker 4>recently?</v>

2273
01:36:05.001 --> 01:36:10.001
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have such a poor science background </v>

2274
01:36:10.001 --> 01:36:10.001
<v Speaker 4>and just started like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like science is like,</v>

2275
01:36:10.001 --> 01:36:10.001
<v Speaker 4>it's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2276
01:36:10.001 --> 01:36:10.810
<v Speaker 4>What was that</v>

2277
01:36:10.940 --> 01:36:13.940
<v Speaker 5>dumbest thing I've ever heard?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just such a moron.</v>

2278
01:36:16.670 --> 01:36:20.570
<v Speaker 5>Can I leave on that day?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was the dumbest fucking incredible.</v>

2279
01:36:20.840 --> 01:36:25.840
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to go out on a limb and say </v>
<v Speaker 5>that is the dumbest thing I'm going to </v>

2280
01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:29.561
<v Speaker 5>say this year.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really hope that that was the low </v>

2281
01:36:29.561 --> 01:36:30.010
<v Speaker 5>point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's where you're leaving and going to</v>

2282
01:36:30.020 --> 01:36:35.020
<v Speaker 5>be fun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Science is like really incredible cut.</v>

2283
01:36:35.960 --> 01:36:38.180
<v Speaker 5>Have that bill on more often.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was just so.</v>

2284
01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:40.360
<v Speaker 4>It's super neat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2285
01:36:40.550 --> 01:36:43.320
<v Speaker 4>I was just watching this thing on </v>
<v Speaker 4>gyroscopes when I was a kid.</v>

2286
01:36:43.321 --> 01:36:45.720
<v Speaker 4>They would call tops and he just spun </v>
<v Speaker 4>him and stared at them.</v>

2287
01:36:45.721 --> 01:36:47.210
<v Speaker 4>They weren't telling you what was going </v>
<v Speaker 4>on.</v>

2288
01:36:47.240 --> 01:36:52.240
<v Speaker 4>This guy gets this gyroscope going and </v>
<v Speaker 4>he puts it on like a cone and it's on </v>

2289
01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:56.601
<v Speaker 4>the side and in my world it's defying </v>
<v Speaker 4>gravity and it's just going around this </v>

2290
01:36:56.601 --> 01:36:58.330
<v Speaker 4>thing and I don't get how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't get what's going on.</v>

2291
01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:01.440
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well there's a lot of that out there.</v>

2292
01:37:01.780 --> 01:37:04.560
<v Speaker 6>If you just.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Did I explain it bad?</v>

2293
01:37:04.561 --> 01:37:05.560
<v Speaker 6>You were just kinda like.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2294
01:37:05.640 --> 01:37:07.950
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what a gyroscope.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What does it look?</v>

2295
01:37:07.980 --> 01:37:08.850
<v Speaker 6>Look up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Gyroscope.</v>

2296
01:37:08.940 --> 01:37:10.260
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know what a gyroscope is.</v>

2297
01:37:10.430 --> 01:37:15.430
<v Speaker 6>It,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's because it's like seventh grade </v>

2298
01:37:15.430 --> 01:37:15.430
<v Speaker 6>talking about sex.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know what that means?</v>

2299
01:37:15.430 --> 01:37:15.990
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know what it means.</v>

2300
01:37:17.270 --> 01:37:18.240
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what is it?</v>

2301
01:37:18.241 --> 01:37:21.270
<v Speaker 6>Just the momentum a gyroscope.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So what's in those?</v>

2302
01:37:21.271 --> 01:37:22.560
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>those,</v>

2303
01:37:22.561 --> 01:37:23.820
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>segways.</v>

2304
01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:25.230
<v Speaker 6>That's a gyroscope.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2305
01:37:25.380 --> 01:37:28.590
<v Speaker 6>I think it's in a helicopter.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it's in a helicopter.</v>

2306
01:37:28.591 --> 01:37:33.591
<v Speaker 6>Makes Sense.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean that it would balance out the </v>

2307
01:37:33.591 --> 01:37:33.591
<v Speaker 6>helicopter.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2308
01:37:33.591 --> 01:37:33.990
<v Speaker 6>I finally figured I finally read.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I didn't figure it out.</v>

2309
01:37:33.991 --> 01:37:36.390
<v Speaker 6>They told me like I'm discovering </v>
<v Speaker 6>helicopters.</v>

2310
01:37:36.391 --> 01:37:41.391
<v Speaker 6>So that back thing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that back road or is to prevent the </v>

2311
01:37:41.391 --> 01:37:41.820
<v Speaker 6>thing from spinning around.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2312
01:37:41.821 --> 01:37:44.560
<v Speaker 6>That's why when it gets shot and movies,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the fucking helicopters.</v>

2313
01:37:44.730 --> 01:37:49.730
<v Speaker 6>I saw that and I didn't realize it that </v>
<v Speaker 6>that's what that things function was </v>

2314
01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:53.130
<v Speaker 6>understanding of helicopter Gyro.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2315
01:37:53.131 --> 01:37:53.370
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

2316
01:37:53.371 --> 01:37:54.600
<v Speaker 6>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just look up gyroscopes.</v>

2317
01:37:54.630 --> 01:37:55.560
<v Speaker 6>You gotta see this guy?</v>

2318
01:37:56.210 --> 01:37:56.730
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>

2319
01:37:56.860 --> 01:37:59.610
<v Speaker 4>what am I looking for?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just a gyroscope.</v>

2320
01:37:59.850 --> 01:38:01.260
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This guy,</v>

2321
01:38:01.261 --> 01:38:01.920
<v Speaker 4>I sweated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>

2322
01:38:01.921 --> 01:38:06.921
<v Speaker 4>he's going to do something that's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>better magic trick that I've ever seen </v>

2323
01:38:06.921 --> 01:38:06.921
<v Speaker 4>anybody doing vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just chairs.</v>

2324
01:38:06.921 --> 01:38:08.640
<v Speaker 4>Scope on youtube of the little tiny </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

2325
01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:11.520
<v Speaker 4>Let me see this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's go this fresh face.</v>

2326
01:38:11.850 --> 01:38:12.660
<v Speaker 4>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy right here.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Son of a bitch.</v>

2329
01:38:17.810 --> 01:38:22.810
<v Speaker 4>A.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The reason why you can do it because </v>

2330
01:38:22.810 --> 01:38:22.830
<v Speaker 4>it's going so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's pushing down.</v>

2331
01:38:22.850 --> 01:38:27.850
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because gravity so like you could have </v>

2332
01:38:27.850 --> 01:38:27.850
<v Speaker 4>like on the side of a can or something </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>

2333
01:38:27.850 --> 01:38:31.500
<v Speaker 4>This fast and I hang on you guys say </v>
<v Speaker 4>something funny is this is coming up.</v>

2334
01:38:35.010 --> 01:38:36.840

<v Speaker 4>Here we go.</v>

2335
01:38:36.850 --> 01:38:38.160
<v Speaker 4>Farish scope.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's online.</v>

2336
01:38:38.340 --> 01:38:39.540
<v Speaker 4>It's up there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bill.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look.</v>

2339
01:38:40.580 --> 01:38:44.250
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so what you want to be is get to.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2342
01:38:46.351 --> 01:38:51.351
<v Speaker 4>Get to about a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Forty in somebody for the love of God </v>

2343
01:38:51.351 --> 01:38:51.351
<v Speaker 4>explained that.</v>

2344
01:38:51.351 --> 01:38:51.351
<v Speaker 5>Tell me how that works out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll fuck.</v>

2345
01:38:51.351 --> 01:38:52.280
<v Speaker 5>Does that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2346
01:38:52.290 --> 01:38:57.290
<v Speaker 5>that's it's balancing and it's spinning </v>
<v Speaker 5>around in a circle and it's not hitting </v>

2347
01:38:57.290 --> 01:39:00.700
<v Speaker 5>the floor until it runs out of momentum.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Spinning,</v>

2348
01:39:00.701 --> 01:39:02.470
<v Speaker 5>gyroscope,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bullet balance on a string.</v>

2349
01:39:03.910 --> 01:39:04.710
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at that.</v>

2350
01:39:05.320 --> 01:39:07.510
<v Speaker 5>That's amazing dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is magic to me.</v>

2351
01:39:08.390 --> 01:39:10.990
<v Speaker 5>Well that's why those segways work </v>
<v Speaker 5>somehow or another.</v>

2352
01:39:11.780 --> 01:39:12.570
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't understand.</v>

2353
01:39:12.580 --> 01:39:13.300
<v Speaker 5>I just love that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This,</v>

2354
01:39:13.301 --> 01:39:16.570
<v Speaker 5>the technology of that and then some </v>
<v Speaker 5>dumb ass like me can get on one like,</v>

2355
01:39:16.700 --> 01:39:20.220
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>slam into a wall with a looped around.</v>

2356
01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:25.240
<v Speaker 5>One is thinking about a phone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know that you use every day and </v>

2357
01:39:25.240 --> 01:39:29.130
<v Speaker 5>nobody knew.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If I'm ever out of like if there's a </v>

2358
01:39:29.130 --> 01:39:29.140
<v Speaker 5>power outage,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm getting one of these.</v>

2359
01:39:29.141 --> 01:39:31.990
<v Speaker 5>If I have to entertain guests and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>just going to start spinning this thing,</v>

2360
01:39:32.680 --> 01:39:35.590
<v Speaker 5>this lava rock right there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people are gonna be blown away.</v>

2361
01:39:35.620 --> 01:39:36.190
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look at it.</v>

2362
01:39:36.610 --> 01:39:38.890
<v Speaker 5>You could start a car caused the power </v>
<v Speaker 5>outage.</v>

2363
01:39:39.810 --> 01:39:42.220
<v Speaker 5>There's got to be done within me that </v>
<v Speaker 5>would actually buy into it.</v>

2364
01:39:42.280 --> 01:39:43.180
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for sure.</v>

2365
01:39:43.181 --> 01:39:45.790
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever watched videos?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is pretty amazing.</v>

2366
01:39:46.780 --> 01:39:48.880
<v Speaker 4>It is pretty amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does it have to do with space?</v>

2367
01:39:49.420 --> 01:39:50.830
<v Speaker 4>Hmm?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do I swear to God?</v>

2368
01:39:50.860 --> 01:39:53.320
<v Speaker 4>You could actually see how dumb the </v>
<v Speaker 4>average person is.</v>

2369
01:39:53.350 --> 01:39:54.820
<v Speaker 4>Like I consider myself an average </v>
<v Speaker 4>person.</v>

2370
01:39:54.830 --> 01:39:56.190
<v Speaker 4>You'd go to a bar with one of those </v>
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

2371
01:39:56.191 --> 01:40:00.040
<v Speaker 4>They literally like five bucks and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>could just like blow minds with the</v>

2372
01:40:00.650 --> 01:40:01.550
<v Speaker 5>just blah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're like,</v>

2373
01:40:01.800 --> 01:40:02.570
<v Speaker 5>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck you.</v>

2374
01:40:02.571 --> 01:40:04.430
<v Speaker 5>Is anybody ever gotten laid because of a</v>
<v Speaker 5>gyroscope?</v>

2375
01:40:04.460 --> 01:40:06.290
<v Speaker 5>You do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're wearing a cape and you show it</v>

2376
01:40:06.291 --> 01:40:10.820
<v Speaker 5>in that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's over with a big point.</v>

2377
01:40:10.821 --> 01:40:15.821
<v Speaker 5>You read things like Dracula and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>you know you do when they ask you </v>

2378
01:40:15.821 --> 01:40:16.110
<v Speaker 5>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As you delay for a second and staring at</v>

2379
01:40:16.130 --> 01:40:18.770
<v Speaker 5>them like your mysterious,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like Ryan gosling and drive,</v>

2380
01:40:18.860 --> 01:40:20.150
<v Speaker 5>I can tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2381
01:40:20.210 --> 01:40:21.920
<v Speaker 5>Ryan gosling and drive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He did that.</v>

2382
01:40:21.921 --> 01:40:23.320
<v Speaker 5>He did let that delay thing and you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2383
01:40:23.330 --> 01:40:24.830
<v Speaker 5>mind fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You like what's going on?</v>

2384
01:40:24.890 --> 01:40:26.330
<v Speaker 5>What's what's happening here?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2385
01:40:26.331 --> 01:40:28.280

<v Speaker 4>I completely stole all of that.</v>

2389
01:40:35.361 --> 01:40:37.310
<v Speaker 4>On that flight to indy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was just like,</v>

2390
01:40:37.311 --> 01:40:38.570

<v Speaker 4>I would have.</v>

2395
01:40:48.270 --> 01:40:51.250
<v Speaker 4>I would have told the flight lady,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would have been the one son,</v>

2403
01:41:07.151 --> 01:41:12.151
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just knew he wasn't going to do </v>

2404
01:41:12.151 --> 01:41:12.151
<v Speaker 4>anything and I knew if I didn't I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of feeding it.</v>

<v Speaker 4>invited them to your show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That would have been great.</v>

01:41:23.101 --> 01:41:23.410
<v Speaker 4>They said you should've given them </v>
<v Speaker 4>tickets.</v>

2410
01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:28.680
<v Speaker 4>Wish the old school.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We actually had tickets opened up and </v>

2411
01:41:28.680 --> 01:41:29.260
<v Speaker 4>talked about it on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did open with it that night.</v>

2412
01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:30.640
<v Speaker 4>Did you really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2413
01:41:30.641 --> 01:41:35.641
<v Speaker 4>but I was still kind of weirded out by </v>
<v Speaker 4>it so it kind of came out as creepy </v>

2414
01:41:35.641 --> 01:41:35.641
<v Speaker 4>rather than.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I just was like,</v>

2415
01:41:35.641 --> 01:41:35.800
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>

2416
01:41:35.801 --> 01:41:37.510
<v Speaker 4>this is more of a podcast story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2417
01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:40.860
<v Speaker 1>and here we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What percentage of your,</v>

2418
01:41:40.861 --> 01:41:42.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your crowds in our podcast crowds,</v>

2419
01:41:42.770 --> 01:41:45.740
<v Speaker 1>like people know you from the podcast?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea when you say</v>

2420
01:41:47.940 --> 01:41:49.730
<v Speaker 4>response,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think that they're,</v>

2421
01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:53.010
<v Speaker 4>it's like they're into the specialist </v>
<v Speaker 4>there into the podcast and thing.</v>

2422
01:41:53.020 --> 01:41:53.850
<v Speaker 4>You just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's great man.</v>

2423
01:41:53.851 --> 01:41:55.950
<v Speaker 4>You just carve out your own little store</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the Internet.</v>

2424
01:41:56.490 --> 01:42:01.490
<v Speaker 4>This is me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is what I do feel like it come on </v>

2425
01:42:01.490 --> 01:42:01.490
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

2426
01:42:01.490 --> 01:42:02.300
<v Speaker 4>and then all you do is you just never </v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck them.</v>

2427
01:42:03.070 --> 01:42:06.570
<v Speaker 4>You always come out with a new hour and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you never take a show off.</v>

2428
01:42:06.571 --> 01:42:08.520
<v Speaker 4>You just don't fuck them because that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>the relationship.</v>

2429
01:42:08.521 --> 01:42:13.521
<v Speaker 4>When they say they love you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's basically I love you until you </v>

2430
01:42:13.521 --> 01:42:13.521
<v Speaker 4>suck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't fuck me.</v>

2431
01:42:13.521 --> 01:42:13.980
<v Speaker 4>That's basically it because we don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>know each other.</v>

2432
01:42:13.981 --> 01:42:16.200
<v Speaker 4>So I understand the responsibility of </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2433
01:42:16.710 --> 01:42:19.810
<v Speaker 4>And I always try to have good openers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just want the wire to wire.</v>

2434
01:42:19.830 --> 01:42:22.260
<v Speaker 4>Good show you came out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good time.</v>

2435
01:42:22.261 --> 01:42:25.230
<v Speaker 4>Go out there fucking take pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kissing babies,</v>

2436
01:42:25.231 --> 01:42:26.370
<v Speaker 4>shaking hands.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's great.</v>

2437
01:42:26.410 --> 01:42:29.310
<v Speaker 4>I really like afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2438
01:42:29.370 --> 01:42:34.370
<v Speaker 4>at first I didn't like going out there </v>
<v Speaker 4>but that was more my awkwardness and </v>

2439
01:42:34.370 --> 01:42:36.090
<v Speaker 4>then like my issues with that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But now I've actually,</v>

2440
01:42:36.780 --> 01:42:38.670
<v Speaker 4>I kind of know as honestly not like </v>
<v Speaker 4>super trump.</v>

2441
01:42:38.671 --> 01:42:39.880
<v Speaker 4>Those people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2442
01:42:39.890 --> 01:42:42.270
<v Speaker 4>like it was like a motor boat and your </v>
<v Speaker 4>face just spitting</v>

2443
01:42:45.160 --> 01:42:47.400
<v Speaker 4>and they're like complimenting uses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like spitting in your face.</v>

2444
01:42:47.401 --> 01:42:50.070
<v Speaker 4>Like that becomes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then it's like,</v>

2445
01:42:50.130 --> 01:42:50.440
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2446
01:42:51.130 --> 01:42:56.130
<v Speaker 1>I have the exact same attitude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the exact same attitude about the </v>

2447
01:42:56.130 --> 01:42:58.921
<v Speaker 1>audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the camp fuck 'em and you gotta </v>

2448
01:42:58.921 --> 01:42:58.921
<v Speaker 1>keep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep giving them a free shit.</v>

2449
01:42:58.921 --> 01:42:59.170
<v Speaker 1>That's why I love keeping the podcast </v>
<v Speaker 1>free.</v>

2450
01:42:59.190 --> 01:43:00.940
<v Speaker 1>That's why I love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2451
01:43:00.970 --> 01:43:02.410
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2452
01:43:02.470 --> 01:43:07.470
<v Speaker 1>the idea that you're always going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have them there as long as you keep </v>

2453
01:43:07.470 --> 01:43:08.470
<v Speaker 1>providing good content,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you keep coming up with new material</v>

2454
01:43:08.620 --> 01:43:12.010
<v Speaker 4>and you can't expect anything more on it</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I've done the same thing.</v>

2455
01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:17.280
<v Speaker 4>I love bands in the eighties and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>they started to suck and I never bought </v>

2456
01:43:17.280 --> 01:43:18.270
<v Speaker 4>any more of their albums.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So am I really a fast?</v>

2457
01:43:18.280 --> 01:43:21.310
<v Speaker 4>Like I like you when you do good stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like it when you do stuff.</v>

2458
01:43:21.320 --> 01:43:21.770
<v Speaker 4>I like,</v>

2459
01:43:22.780 --> 01:43:27.780
<v Speaker 1>I have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a big fear of that when I was </v>

2460
01:43:27.780 --> 01:43:32.050
<v Speaker 1>first coming up that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy's sort of seemed to have it and</v>

2461
01:43:32.051 --> 01:43:34.840
<v Speaker 1>then lose it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of guys that fall into</v>

2462
01:43:34.841 --> 01:43:37.900
<v Speaker 1>that category that were really funny at </v>
<v Speaker 1>first and then lost it,</v>

2463
01:43:37.901 --> 01:43:39.790
<v Speaker 1>including contemporaries that I won't </v>
<v Speaker 1>mention.</v>

2464
01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:43.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to hurt anybody's feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as far as dead guys,</v>

2465
01:43:43.450 --> 01:43:45.040
<v Speaker 1>Kennison was my favorite example of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2466
01:43:45.400 --> 01:43:48.880
<v Speaker 1>Kennison I think in like 86,</v>
<v Speaker 1>87 was the greatest guy ever.</v>

2467
01:43:48.881 --> 01:43:50.600
<v Speaker 1>I think it was one of the funniest </v>
<v Speaker 1>comics ever ever.</v>

2468
01:43:50.650 --> 01:43:52.250
<v Speaker 1>And then when I came along</v>

2469
01:43:52.330 --> 01:43:54.620
<v Speaker 6>and I came along and Ada,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's more like,</v>

2470
01:43:55.010 --> 01:43:57.980
<v Speaker 6>like three all time behind,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like prior and then,</v>

2471
01:43:58.040 --> 01:44:00.560
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>his body of work or a bill cosby.</v>

2472
01:44:00.561 --> 01:44:03.110
<v Speaker 6>I mean you just have to like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's all subjective,</v>

2473
01:44:03.111 --> 01:44:05.370
<v Speaker 6>but I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I put Carlin,</v>

2474
01:44:05.990 --> 01:44:08.270
<v Speaker 6>I mean a lot of people would be pissed </v>
<v Speaker 6>at me for this,</v>

2475
01:44:08.271 --> 01:44:12.000
<v Speaker 6>but I put Carlin like fourth.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What's the fourth?</v>

2476
01:44:12.010 --> 01:44:14.240
<v Speaker 6>All time and me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>somebody's going to get mad man,</v>

2477
01:44:14.270 --> 01:44:16.800
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you put Hixon for the coral.</v>

2478
01:44:16.810 --> 01:44:18.820
<v Speaker 6>And because Hinduism is funny.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

2479
01:44:19.640 --> 01:44:24.640
<v Speaker 6>I think Hicks had this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 6>groundbreaking sort of new take on </v>

2480
01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:29.051
<v Speaker 6>standup that inspired so many other </v>
<v Speaker 6>people to sort of like branch down that </v>

2481
01:44:29.051 --> 01:44:31.160
<v Speaker 6>path that I always put him right up </v>
<v Speaker 6>there.</v>

2482
01:44:31.210 --> 01:44:32.350
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's also like a bad thing.</v>

2483
01:44:32.351 --> 01:44:37.351
<v Speaker 4>Some people like rush and neil part,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some people like led Zepplin and John </v>

2484
01:44:37.351 --> 01:44:37.930
<v Speaker 4>Bonham and that thing that happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But who cares as long as you're in,</v>

2485
01:44:37.960 --> 01:44:39.370
<v Speaker 4>you just want to be in the argument.</v>

2486
01:44:39.520 --> 01:44:41.320
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>For me it's prior,</v>

2487
01:44:41.321 --> 01:44:42.310
<v Speaker 6>all time,</v>
<v Speaker 6>number one,</v>

2488
01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:43.360
<v Speaker 6>buyers,</v>
<v Speaker 6>number one.</v>

2489
01:44:43.680 --> 01:44:48.680
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then it's Kennison and then Hicks </v>

2490
01:44:48.680 --> 01:44:49.100
<v Speaker 6>and then um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then Carla,</v>

2491
01:44:49.380 --> 01:44:52.020
<v Speaker 4>but there's a through line to that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that order.</v>

2492
01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:54.490
<v Speaker 4>That makes sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I could see that,</v>

2493
01:44:54.550 --> 01:44:55.410
<v Speaker 4>that obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2494
01:44:55.411 --> 01:44:58.470
<v Speaker 4>I know that you do stand up obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like there's like that order.</v>

2495
01:44:58.471 --> 01:45:00.570
<v Speaker 4>I like if I just saw someone listed like</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2496
01:45:00.571 --> 01:45:01.170
<v Speaker 4>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2497
01:45:01.171 --> 01:45:03.450
<v Speaker 4>this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he likes this style,</v>

2498
01:45:04.020 --> 01:45:08.460
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like Kennison is,</v>

2499
01:45:08.520 --> 01:45:12.810
<v Speaker 4>is like if he had just come out the </v>
<v Speaker 4>other side where like,</v>

2500
01:45:13.380 --> 01:45:15.480
<v Speaker 4>it seemed like he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2501
01:45:15.640 --> 01:45:20.640
<v Speaker 4>like just fell into every pitfall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stepped in every batch alcohol,</v>

2502
01:45:21.350 --> 01:45:22.500
<v Speaker 4>the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lazy.</v>

2503
01:45:22.900 --> 01:45:24.380
<v Speaker 4>Like in [inaudible] 86.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2504
01:45:24.420 --> 01:45:26.460
<v Speaker 4>I mean that was one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2505
01:45:26.461 --> 01:45:29.820
<v Speaker 4>his first letterman spot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude is fucking unbelief.</v>

2506
01:45:29.850 --> 01:45:34.850
<v Speaker 4>Just the vibe in the studio.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can feel it like we have no idea </v>

2507
01:45:34.850 --> 01:45:34.850
<v Speaker 4>what this guy is going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Man,</v>

2508
01:45:34.850 --> 01:45:36.930
<v Speaker 4>this guy and he came out and did not </v>
<v Speaker 4>disappoint.</v>

2509
01:45:36.931 --> 01:45:41.931
<v Speaker 4>But if you look at the difference </v>
<v Speaker 4>between the first one and the second </v>

2510
01:45:41.931 --> 01:45:43.761
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's already starting like whatever he </v>

2511
01:45:43.761 --> 01:45:45.681
<v Speaker 4>was going through.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I remember when he got all cleaned </v>

2512
01:45:45.681 --> 01:45:45.681
<v Speaker 4>up and he was getting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was coming back.</v>

2513
01:45:45.681 --> 01:45:47.400
<v Speaker 4>It was really like the Stevie Ray </v>
<v Speaker 4>Vaughan thing.</v>

2514
01:45:47.401 --> 01:45:51.480
<v Speaker 4>Like he just got all cleaned up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>turn in and around in his life.</v>

2515
01:45:51.510 --> 01:45:52.470
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can't.</v>

2516
01:45:52.500 --> 01:45:54.170
<v Speaker 6>Even when he died,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they found cocaine.</v>

2517
01:45:54.190 --> 01:45:56.070
<v Speaker 6>The system,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was never really cleaned up.</v>

2518
01:45:56.370 --> 01:45:58.740
<v Speaker 6>La Wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>could claim to be cleaning up,</v>

2519
01:45:58.741 --> 01:46:03.741
<v Speaker 6>but it wasn't clear that though,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because I know I know everything about </v>

2520
01:46:03.741 --> 01:46:04.320
<v Speaker 6>them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's first of all,</v>

2521
01:46:04.321 --> 01:46:05.670
<v Speaker 6>his brother,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I read his book,</v>

2522
01:46:05.730 --> 01:46:09.840
<v Speaker 6>read his brother's book and talked to </v>
<v Speaker 6>will always kill my theories with facts.</v>

2523

<v Speaker 4>I didn't even hear the boom.</v>

2531
01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:26.280
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

2538
01:46:50.190 --> 01:46:52.110
<v Speaker 1>I think only twice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at least twice.</v>

2546
01:47:07.800 --> 01:47:11.010
<v Speaker 1>It was already over by 89.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was already over.</v>

2547
01:47:11.070 --> 01:47:12.740
<v Speaker 1>He would go up and he would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2548
01:47:12.810 --> 01:47:15.950
<v Speaker 1>he would do like this cheerleading thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>about like drinking and drive.</v>

2549
01:47:15.990 --> 01:47:16.800
<v Speaker 1>We got to do it.</v>

<v Speaker 9>Who got drag?</v>

01:47:23.850 --> 01:47:25.650
<v Speaker 1>But it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no jokes,</v>

2555
01:47:25.680 --> 01:47:30.680
<v Speaker 1>the jokes were gone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like all the shit about the African </v>

2556
01:47:30.680 --> 01:47:30.680
<v Speaker 1>children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like why don't you feed them.</v>

2557
01:47:30.680 --> 01:47:32.350
<v Speaker 7>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But it's not like you don't lose that.</v>

2558
01:47:32.410 --> 01:47:37.410
<v Speaker 7>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he was adjusting and right as he was </v>

2559
01:47:37.410 --> 01:47:38.860
<v Speaker 7>coming out of it evidently still was </v>
<v Speaker 7>coming a bit according to you.</v>

2560
01:47:38.890 --> 01:47:43.890
<v Speaker 7>Like I would have loved to have seen </v>
<v Speaker 7>what that guy was going to do because,</v>

2561
01:47:43.901 --> 01:47:44.370
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2562
01:47:44.460 --> 01:47:47.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he was done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is why I think it was done.</v>

2563
01:47:47.430 --> 01:47:49.440
<v Speaker 1>I think you can only do coke for so </v>
<v Speaker 1>long.</v>

2564
01:47:49.500 --> 01:47:51.240
<v Speaker 1>You're crushing me here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

2565
01:47:51.400 --> 01:47:56.400
<v Speaker 7>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I handle the hold on my dream that he </v>

2566
01:47:56.400 --> 01:47:56.400
<v Speaker 7>would have come back and he would have </v>
<v Speaker 7>been in 45,</v>

2567
01:47:56.400 --> 01:47:59.260
<v Speaker 1>gotten on some fucking Kale shakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>started doing hill sprints and shed.</v>

2568
01:47:59.261 --> 01:48:04.261
<v Speaker 1>But do you know Kennison his story?</v>
<v Speaker 1>His life story is a fascinating one </v>

2569
01:48:04.261 --> 01:48:06.070
<v Speaker 1>because he was a normal kid until he got</v>
<v Speaker 1>hit by a truck.</v>

2570
01:48:06.640 --> 01:48:08.670
<v Speaker 1>He got hit by a truck and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

2571
01:48:08.720 --> 01:48:10.990
<v Speaker 1>he suffered like some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>traumatic brain injury.</v>

2572
01:48:11.320 --> 01:48:14.770
<v Speaker 1>And after that became reckless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just wild as fuck.</v>

2573
01:48:14.800 --> 01:48:19.800
<v Speaker 1>It was like a completely different kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like Kennison wanting Kennison </v>

2574
01:48:19.800 --> 01:48:23.280
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Kennison one was like a normal </v>

2575
01:48:23.280 --> 01:48:25.950
<v Speaker 1>average seven minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got cracked and he got hurt real bad </v>

2576
01:48:26.470 --> 01:48:29.620
<v Speaker 1>and from then he was reckless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just wild,</v>

2577
01:48:30.010 --> 01:48:32.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he did a lot of crazy shit man.</v>

2578
01:48:32.340 --> 01:48:37.340
<v Speaker 1>And if you look back at his life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like his impulse control was like </v>

2579
01:48:37.340 --> 01:48:38.170
<v Speaker 1>nonexistent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he fucked Carla Bose wife.</v>

2580
01:48:38.200 --> 01:48:42.140
<v Speaker 1>Carla boat was opening right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was carl talks about it.</v>

2581
01:48:42.330 --> 01:48:46.810
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say it any other work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This carl found,</v>

2582
01:48:47.110 --> 01:48:50.500
<v Speaker 1>Carl found out that his daughter's </v>
<v Speaker 1>father,</v>

2583
01:48:51.100 --> 01:48:56.100
<v Speaker 1>he thought it was his daughter and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was just fucking Sam Kennison who's his </v>

2584
01:48:56.100 --> 01:48:56.100
<v Speaker 1>best friend the whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2585
01:48:56.140 --> 01:48:57.820
<v Speaker 1>the whole craziness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2586
01:48:58.100 --> 01:48:59.160
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2587
01:48:59.170 --> 01:49:03.580
<v Speaker 1>You hate to see that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I learned a lot watching them.</v>

2588
01:49:03.610 --> 01:49:08.610
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned in the beginning what was </v>

2589
01:49:08.610 --> 01:49:08.610
<v Speaker 1>possible when I saw him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his first HBO special specials.</v>

2590
01:49:08.610 --> 01:49:09.340
<v Speaker 1>Like there's the grants committee I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever seen.</v>

2591
01:49:09.580 --> 01:49:11.810
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't believe this is even comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I couldn't believe,</v>

2592
01:49:11.811 --> 01:49:14.050
<v Speaker 1>like someone figured out this new way of</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing comedy.</v>

2593
01:49:14.410 --> 01:49:17.740
<v Speaker 1>But then to see him just become really </v>
<v Speaker 1>shitty after that,</v>

2594
01:49:17.770 --> 01:49:18.400
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

2595
01:49:18.401 --> 01:49:23.401
<v Speaker 1>that can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you need to know that that can </v>

2596
01:49:23.401 --> 01:49:23.401
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

2597
01:49:23.401 --> 01:49:23.401
<v Speaker 7>I think you've been to water and the </v>
<v Speaker 7>guy.</v>

2598
01:49:23.401 --> 01:49:23.780
<v Speaker 7>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2599
01:49:23.781 --> 01:49:28.781
<v Speaker 7>because he died prematurely.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're talking about like he's still </v>

2600
01:49:28.781 --> 01:49:30.350
<v Speaker 7>alive in the nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He died in the nineties.</v>

2601
01:49:30.380 --> 01:49:32.000
<v Speaker 7>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm older than he was when he died.</v>

2602
01:49:32.210 --> 01:49:33.150
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So yeah,</v>

2603
01:49:33.151 --> 01:49:34.010
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean like,</v>

2604
01:49:34.430 --> 01:49:39.430
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm just saying like he was pulling </v>

2605
01:49:39.430 --> 01:49:39.430
<v Speaker 7>himself out of the mud and then he,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he,</v>

2606
01:49:39.430 --> 01:49:41.720
<v Speaker 7>he died.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So it's like,</v>

2607
01:49:42.260 --> 01:49:47.260
<v Speaker 7>it just gets cut off.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So you have no idea you'd given them a </v>

2608
01:49:47.260 --> 01:49:47.260
<v Speaker 7>break because he's dead.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I see what you're doing.</v>

2609
01:49:47.260 --> 01:49:47.340
<v Speaker 7>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Am.</v>

2610
01:49:47.380 --> 01:49:47.890
<v Speaker 7>Because</v>

2611
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:51.070
<v Speaker 4>it's like your making it seem like those</v>
<v Speaker 4>last few years,</v>

2612
01:49:51.110 --> 01:49:52.750
<v Speaker 4>that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's all he was going to be.</v>

2613
01:49:52.960 --> 01:49:53.700
<v Speaker 4>You can't say that.</v>

2614
01:49:53.820 --> 01:49:56.950
<v Speaker 1>Well your podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

2615
01:49:56.951 --> 01:49:58.880
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's possible that he could come back.</v>

2616
01:49:58.970 --> 01:50:00.740
<v Speaker 1>There was no evidence that he was coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

2617
01:50:00.980 --> 01:50:03.120
<v Speaker 1>The material that he was doing was shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

2618
01:50:03.150 --> 01:50:08.150
<v Speaker 1>it was just poorly thought out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like he never sat in front of a </v>

2619
01:50:08.150 --> 01:50:08.380
<v Speaker 1>fucking notebook and actually wrote it </v>
<v Speaker 1>out anymore.</v>

2620
01:50:08.390 --> 01:50:10.880
<v Speaker 1>You didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't tighten things up and.</v>

<v Speaker 4>He couldn't get around to them,</v>

2639
01:50:47.481 --> 01:50:51.190
<v Speaker 4>so he just this giant fucking through </v>
<v Speaker 4>an.</v>

2640
01:50:51.191 --> 01:50:53.240
<v Speaker 4>He's younger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When he was younger,</v>

2641
01:50:53.241 --> 01:50:58.241
<v Speaker 4>he's doing is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's still in his triplets and he would </v>

2642
01:50:58.241 --> 01:50:58.880
<v Speaker 4>do this thing where it was just like </v>
<v Speaker 4>kick left,</v>

2643
01:50:58.881 --> 01:51:00.050
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then it was boom,</v>

2644
01:51:00.051 --> 01:51:02.470
<v Speaker 4>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then cross over and then back and it</v>

2645
01:51:02.471 --> 01:51:06.170
<v Speaker 4>was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we did it like a 90 miles an hour.</v>

2646
01:51:06.171 --> 01:51:09.160
<v Speaker 4>You see them at Royal Albert Hall at the</v>
<v Speaker 4>height of his powers.</v>

2647
01:51:09.170 --> 01:51:11.210
<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unbelievable drummer.</v>

2648
01:51:11.540 --> 01:51:14.630
<v Speaker 4>And then as he got older,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like his finance was,</v>

2649
01:51:14.690 --> 01:51:16.160
<v Speaker 4>was incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he didn't,</v>

2650
01:51:16.161 --> 01:51:17.040
<v Speaker 4>he didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2651
01:51:17.090 --> 01:51:21.050
<v Speaker 4>like he didn't have to do all that to </v>
<v Speaker 4>get the same kind of power and a.</v>

2652
01:51:21.080 --> 01:51:24.470
<v Speaker 4>But what people would do is they know </v>
<v Speaker 4>that people like trashed,</v>

2653
01:51:24.471 --> 01:51:29.471
<v Speaker 4>like getting off the subject here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People like what you're doing at </v>

2654
01:51:29.471 --> 01:51:29.471
<v Speaker 4>Kennison.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They kind of did the bottom of people.</v>

2655
01:51:29.471 --> 01:51:29.471
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

2656
01:51:29.471 --> 01:51:30.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just telling the truth.</v>

2657
01:51:30.930 --> 01:51:35.100
<v Speaker 1>He fucked up and it's good for any young</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy to sit are out of this.</v>

2658
01:51:35.160 --> 01:51:40.160
<v Speaker 1>And a young comic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's important to see that </v>

2659
01:51:40.160 --> 01:51:41.040
<v Speaker 1>that's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it got caught up in his own wave and</v>

2660
01:51:41.250 --> 01:51:43.170
<v Speaker 1>he became a caricature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2661
01:51:43.171 --> 01:51:44.520
<v Speaker 1>it became like a,</v>

2662
01:51:45.630 --> 01:51:48.000
<v Speaker 4>I just pictured you becoming a </v>
<v Speaker 4>caricature of yourself.</v>

2663
01:51:48.030 --> 01:51:49.960
<v Speaker 4>How can I do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you come out and all you're doing is</v>

2664
01:51:49.961 --> 01:51:54.961
<v Speaker 4>just throwing kicks the fucking show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Coming out with a speed bag comic comedy</v>

2665
01:51:56.191 --> 01:51:58.790
<v Speaker 4>speed Piscopo for this going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2666
01:51:59.440 --> 01:52:04.440
<v Speaker 4>I do remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He took a steroid test during his </v>

2667
01:52:04.440 --> 01:52:04.740
<v Speaker 4>special.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

2668
01:52:04.770 --> 01:52:08.600
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he had a special where he had been.</v>

2669
01:52:08.630 --> 01:52:09.960
<v Speaker 4>One was saying he was on Roids</v>

2670
01:52:10.490 --> 01:52:15.490
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he got really big on </v>

2671
01:52:15.490 --> 01:52:15.490
<v Speaker 1>bodybuilding magazines</v>

2672
01:52:15.490 --> 01:52:15.490
<v Speaker 4>and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So then,</v>

2673
01:52:15.490 --> 01:52:18.260
<v Speaker 4>and it all stemmed from some comment </v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody made when he took his shirt off</v>

2674
01:52:18.261 --> 01:52:18.920
<v Speaker 4>at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at a pool,</v>

2675
01:52:18.921 --> 01:52:22.010
<v Speaker 4>like plastic sensitive performance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then he just went the other way with</v>

2676
01:52:22.011 --> 01:52:27.011
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just became like shred and that guy </v>

2677
01:52:27.011 --> 01:52:27.011
<v Speaker 4>was shredded.</v>

2678
01:52:27.011 --> 01:52:27.400
<v Speaker 1>That's where it came from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody like mocked his.</v>

2679
01:52:28.190 --> 01:52:33.190
<v Speaker 4>I mean I've been talking about a </v>
<v Speaker 4>magazine article I read like in the </v>

2680
01:52:33.190 --> 01:52:33.190
<v Speaker 4>eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2681
01:52:33.190 --> 01:52:38.180
<v Speaker 4>so he got all big like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he has a special actor where he does </v>

2682
01:52:38.180 --> 01:52:38.910
<v Speaker 4>like axl rose and he does all these </v>
<v Speaker 4>guys.</v>

2683
01:52:38.911 --> 01:52:43.911
<v Speaker 4>And in the beginning of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>somewhere towards the beginning he just </v>

2684
01:52:43.911 --> 01:52:45.990
<v Speaker 4>has a guy in a lab coat come out or</v>

2685
01:52:45.990 --> 01:52:50.990
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He sent a lot of people say I'm taking </v>

2686
01:52:50.990 --> 01:52:50.990
<v Speaker 2>roads or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the band's playing.</v>

2687
01:52:50.990 --> 01:52:53.220
<v Speaker 2>He goes offstage and basically I guess </v>
<v Speaker 2>ps in this Cup,</v>

2688
01:52:53.340 --> 01:52:58.340
<v Speaker 2>no way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he does his whole special and the </v>

2689
01:52:58.340 --> 01:52:58.980
<v Speaker 2>special ends in this guy comes back out </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the classic,</v>

2690
01:52:58.981 --> 01:53:03.981
<v Speaker 2>I'm a doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lab coats and it comes out and he's </v>

2691
01:53:03.981 --> 01:53:03.981
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the verdict?</v>

2692
01:53:03.981 --> 01:53:03.981
<v Speaker 2>And they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's clean.</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's clay.</v>

2694
01:53:07.950 --> 01:53:09.030

<v Speaker 2>I sweat it.</v>

2695
01:53:09.031 --> 01:53:14.031
<v Speaker 2>I get so to say it out loud is so nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm starting to wonder if it happened </v>

2696
01:53:14.031 --> 01:53:15.400
<v Speaker 2>and I apologize if I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he's listening,</v>

2725
01:54:36.301 --> 01:54:41.301
<v Speaker 1>the early nineties after appearing </v>

<v Speaker 1>It led many to speculate.</v>

2727
01:54:44.581 --> 01:54:49.581
<v Speaker 1>He was using steroids do dude too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2733
01:55:01.190 --> 01:55:03.810

<v Speaker 1>When we were in Boston,</v>

2734
01:55:03.900 --> 01:55:07.470
<v Speaker 1>Brian Frazier was way bigger than Joe </v>
<v Speaker 1>Piscopo and he was 100 percent natural.</v>

2735
01:55:07.471 --> 01:55:11.670
<v Speaker 1>He's the biggest guy that I've ever met,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I absolutely know for a fact was 100</v>

2736
01:55:11.671 --> 01:55:13.650

02:00:51.241 --> 02:00:51.241
<v Speaker 7>software companies and people ordering </v>
<v Speaker 7>software.</v>

2868
02:00:51.241 --> 02:00:52.570
<v Speaker 7>This is like the 80,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so there's no internet.</v>

2869
02:00:53.170 --> 02:00:58.170
<v Speaker 7>So people would come to our company.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean the company I worked for where </v>

2870
02:00:58.170 --> 02:00:58.170
<v Speaker 7>they had all this software,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Lotus one,</v>

2871
02:00:58.170 --> 02:00:58.510
<v Speaker 7>two,</v>
<v Speaker 7>three,</v>

2872
02:00:59.110 --> 02:00:59.830
<v Speaker 7>Dbas,</v>
<v Speaker 7>three,</v>

2873
02:00:59.831 --> 02:01:02.260
<v Speaker 7>all this old school shit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And uh,</v>

2874
02:01:02.380 --> 02:01:07.090
<v Speaker 7>one day we got into this stupid guy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>competitive thing like fucking morons.</v>

2875
02:01:07.091 --> 02:01:09.250
<v Speaker 7>We didn't realize it like who was </v>
<v Speaker 7>shipping out the most.</v>

2876
02:01:09.610 --> 02:01:13.570
<v Speaker 7>So we started saving them competing with</v>
<v Speaker 7>one another and uh,</v>

2877
02:01:13.580 --> 02:01:16.400
<v Speaker 7>this guy shipped out 100 packages,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so the next day I did 1:20</v>

2878
02:01:16.420 --> 02:01:19.660
<v Speaker 7>and then he did one 60 move fighting and</v>
<v Speaker 7>then the fucking management got room for</v>

2879
02:01:19.661 --> 02:01:19.750
<v Speaker 7>it.</v>

2880
02:01:20.070 --> 02:01:20.820
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

2881
02:01:20.821 --> 02:01:24.540
<v Speaker 2>why don't you start keeping a and a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a number.</v>

2882
02:01:24.541 --> 02:01:29.541
<v Speaker 2>And then they figured out who is being </v>
<v Speaker 2>the most efficient and guys started </v>

2883
02:01:29.541 --> 02:01:29.541
<v Speaker 2>losing their jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I even back then I was like,</v>

2884
02:01:29.541 --> 02:01:30.900
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy stopped fucking doing it.</v>

2885
02:01:31.600 --> 02:01:32.260
<v Speaker 7>Stopped doing it</v>

2886
02:01:32.480 --> 02:01:34.550
<v Speaker 1>because we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're literally cutting our own fucking.</v>

2887
02:01:34.900 --> 02:01:39.900
<v Speaker 1>Well you're making yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You put yourself in a race that's </v>

2888
02:01:39.900 --> 02:01:39.900
<v Speaker 1>there's no.</v>

2889
02:01:39.900 --> 02:01:39.900
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we didn't know any.</v>

2890
02:01:39.900 --> 02:01:41.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we didn't know any better idiots.</v>

2891
02:01:41.631 --> 02:01:43.970
<v Speaker 4>We were like 19,</v>
<v Speaker 4>22.</v>

2892
02:01:44.010 --> 02:01:49.010
<v Speaker 4>We used to fucking go out and drink like</v>
<v Speaker 4>a 12 pack of beer and eat McDonald's at </v>

2893
02:01:49.010 --> 02:01:52.931
<v Speaker 4>one in the morning and by like 8:00</v>
<v Speaker 4>crew unloading trucks find laughing and </v>

2894
02:01:53.091 --> 02:01:58.091
<v Speaker 4>then we would work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We do all this shit and that during </v>

2895
02:01:58.091 --> 02:02:00.790
<v Speaker 4>lunch hour we would go out and play </v>
<v Speaker 4>basketball and like just regular </v>

2896
02:02:01.131 --> 02:02:04.790
<v Speaker 4>sneakers and like five slash 11 blues </v>
<v Speaker 4>number that the butterfly and you'd be.</v>

2897
02:02:05.280 --> 02:02:08.010
<v Speaker 4>You'd come back and pouring sweat and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then just keep on.</v>

2898
02:02:08.120 --> 02:02:10.580
<v Speaker 4>It's the greatest shape I was ever in my</v>
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

2899
02:02:10.581 --> 02:02:14.750
<v Speaker 4>And then in the end of work I would then</v>
<v Speaker 4>go lift and go ride a bike.</v>

2900
02:02:15.160 --> 02:02:16.430
<v Speaker 4>Do remember one time I went on a bike </v>
<v Speaker 4>ride,</v>

2901
02:02:16.431 --> 02:02:21.431
<v Speaker 4>hammered.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was so into working out fucking bike </v>

2902
02:02:21.431 --> 02:02:21.431
<v Speaker 4>ride.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

2903
02:02:21.431 --> 02:02:22.220
<v Speaker 4>I'm like a 12 speed bike that I bought </v>
<v Speaker 4>when I still have it,</v>

2904
02:02:22.221 --> 02:02:23.450
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>am I garage.</v>

2905
02:02:23.450 --> 02:02:25.510
<v Speaker 4>I refuse to throw shit out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

2906
02:02:25.511 --> 02:02:30.511
<v Speaker 4>I remember being hammered on the bike </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm sweating so I'm becoming more </v>

2907
02:02:30.511 --> 02:02:32.960
<v Speaker 4>hammered.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was going to do this 11 mile loop that</v>

2908
02:02:32.961 --> 02:02:33.950
<v Speaker 4>it became,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh seven.</v>

2909
02:02:33.951 --> 02:02:38.951
<v Speaker 4>And then I just kind of came back and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>was like on the bike laughing and I was </v>

2910
02:02:38.951 --> 02:02:42.731
<v Speaker 4>like 20,</v>
<v Speaker 4>21 and was only beginning to understand </v>

2911
02:02:42.731 --> 02:02:46.151
<v Speaker 4>the fragility of life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I knew that what I was doing was </v>

2912
02:02:46.151 --> 02:02:46.151
<v Speaker 4>stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I couldn't get,</v>

2913
02:02:46.151 --> 02:02:50.970
<v Speaker 4>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just kept picturing my friends </v>

2914
02:02:50.970 --> 02:02:50.970
<v Speaker 4>laughing at me and I was literally by </v>
<v Speaker 4>myself riding this bike,</v>

2915
02:02:50.970 --> 02:02:53.450
<v Speaker 4>laughing drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>driving up the street.</v>

2916
02:02:56.140 --> 02:03:01.140
<v Speaker 4>I've been here for two and a half hours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm just taking snippets from </v>

2917
02:03:01.140 --> 02:03:01.140
<v Speaker 4>fucking the ads I got.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got nothing left.</v>

2918
02:03:02.440 --> 02:03:05.180
<v Speaker 4>Used to be able to bounce back so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well when you're young,</v>

2919
02:03:05.330 --> 02:03:10.330
<v Speaker 4>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you're 20 years old you can get </v>

2920
02:03:10.330 --> 02:03:10.330
<v Speaker 4>hammered in the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You barely feel anything.</v>

2921
02:03:10.330 --> 02:03:15.240
<v Speaker 4>Food Donald's and tear down that place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would get to quarter pounders with </v>

2922
02:03:15.240 --> 02:03:15.830
<v Speaker 4>cheese,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a large fry,</v>

2923
02:03:15.850 --> 02:03:17.840
<v Speaker 4>a six piece mcnugget.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I never liked him.</v>

2924
02:03:17.990 --> 02:03:22.990
<v Speaker 4>I never liked him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never thought an ace to try the </v>

2925
02:03:22.990 --> 02:03:23.330
<v Speaker 4>different sauces.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mustard never tastes good.</v>

2926
02:03:23.540 --> 02:03:24.890
<v Speaker 4>I just wanted something to fill the </v>
<v Speaker 4>void.</v>

2927
02:03:25.220 --> 02:03:29.540
<v Speaker 4>And then I would get like a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 4>cheeseburgers and uh,</v>

2928
02:03:30.680 --> 02:03:35.680
<v Speaker 4>I think just a giant coke and just throw</v>
<v Speaker 4>that down and wake up the next day with </v>

2929
02:03:35.680 --> 02:03:36.590
<v Speaker 4>a flat stomach.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I had already drank like,</v>

2930
02:03:36.600 --> 02:03:37.070
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eight,</v>

<v Speaker 4>nine beers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've got to fight.</v>

2932
02:03:40.340 --> 02:03:45.340
<v Speaker 4>We got into a fight one time right under</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Golden Arches and the next town </v>

2933
02:03:45.340 --> 02:03:45.650
<v Speaker 4>over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 4>These guys came in drunk,</v>

2935
02:03:47.511 --> 02:03:52.511
<v Speaker 4>classic Boston Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just come walking in and they give </v>

2936
02:03:52.511 --> 02:03:54.761
<v Speaker 4>everybody the finger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course we respond to it and next </v>

2937
02:03:54.761 --> 02:03:56.630
<v Speaker 4>thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're out underneath the golden arches.</v>

2938
02:03:56.631 --> 02:04:00.170
<v Speaker 4>There's like five of us and two of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

2939
02:04:00.260 --> 02:04:01.300
<v Speaker 4>my buddy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we always fought,</v>

2940
02:04:01.340 --> 02:04:06.340
<v Speaker 4>he starts swinging on the big one and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then the little one he sort of jumped </v>

2941
02:04:06.340 --> 02:04:06.920
<v Speaker 4>and it just became this big and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>looked like wrestling,</v>

2942
02:04:06.921 --> 02:04:11.921
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and like they all come running out of </v>

2943
02:04:11.921 --> 02:04:11.921
<v Speaker 4>the dressing to help each other on snow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's drunk just fallen down.</v>

2944
02:04:11.921 --> 02:04:13.550
<v Speaker 4>We so fucking drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The cops were there,</v>

2945
02:04:13.551 --> 02:04:17.210
<v Speaker 4>like sort of missing mace for like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how long,</v>

2946
02:04:17.240 --> 02:04:21.450
<v Speaker 4>like we didn't even see him pull up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like being in the light.</v>

2947
02:04:21.480 --> 02:04:25.160
<v Speaker 4>Then all of a sudden everybody's eyes </v>
<v Speaker 4>are like tearing up and shit.</v>

2948
02:04:25.340 --> 02:04:30.340
<v Speaker 4>And then what was hilarious was they </v>
<v Speaker 4>just broke us up and they fuck it.</v>

2949
02:04:31.431 --> 02:04:34.730
<v Speaker 4>And then like two seconds say we're back</v>
<v Speaker 4>in our car and the same two guys we were</v>

2950
02:04:34.731 --> 02:04:38.160
<v Speaker 4>fighting were coming back up to the car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what are the cops go?</v>

2951
02:04:38.160 --> 02:04:43.160

<v Speaker 2>And the guys like that was a bullshit </v>

<v Speaker 2>escort.</v>

2962
02:05:06.360 --> 02:05:07.500
<v Speaker 2>They did not give a fuck</v>

<v Speaker 6>into the fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You just got maced.</v>

2967
02:05:18.330 --> 02:05:20.510
<v Speaker 2>Like they had thrown a rock salt because</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were on the ground.</v>

2968
02:05:20.511 --> 02:05:21.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it was,</v>

<v Speaker 6>that's not normal and that there really </v>

2975

<v Speaker 4>and they're unconscious and they get </v>
<v Speaker 4>that extra two,</v>

2980
02:05:53.450 --> 02:05:54.630
<v Speaker 4>three boots to the head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>

2981
02:05:54.660 --> 02:05:56.580
<v Speaker 4>oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For the love,</v>

2982
02:05:56.850 --> 02:05:58.800
<v Speaker 4>for the love of God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just you one.</v>

2983
02:05:59.120 --> 02:06:00.270
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've never been into.</v>

2984
02:06:00.300 --> 02:06:01.240
<v Speaker 6>They either,</v>
<v Speaker 6>believe it or not.</v>

2985
02:06:01.840 --> 02:06:03.770
<v Speaker 6>I was always the guy who got the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 6>out of there.</v>

2986
02:06:03.890 --> 02:06:05.360
<v Speaker 6>I never wanted to have anything to do </v>
<v Speaker 6>with that.</v>

2987
02:06:05.720 --> 02:06:10.720
<v Speaker 6>I didn't mind competition,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but in my kickboxing or martial arts </v>

2988
02:06:10.720 --> 02:06:12.650
<v Speaker 6>tournament or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but a fight on the street.</v>

2989
02:06:12.651 --> 02:06:13.760
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>why don't we do in here?</v>

2990
02:06:13.761 --> 02:06:16.370
<v Speaker 6>This is avoidable.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is chaos.</v>

2991
02:06:16.830 --> 02:06:20.240
<v Speaker 4>This is why my thing that I always used </v>
<v Speaker 4>to get psyched out because I was like,</v>

2992
02:06:20.241 --> 02:06:21.950
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll fight my older brother and lose,</v>

2993
02:06:21.951 --> 02:06:26.951
<v Speaker 4>then I'll take the ass kicking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he has to deal with the fact that </v>

2994
02:06:26.951 --> 02:06:27.290
<v Speaker 4>dad's coming home.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This guy doesn't have to stop,</v>

2995
02:06:27.320 --> 02:06:32.320
<v Speaker 4>dad isn't coming home within this </v>
<v Speaker 4>relationship and he can just keep going </v>

2996
02:06:32.320 --> 02:06:35.560
<v Speaker 4>and I've always been slow as shit so you</v>
<v Speaker 4>could literally tell me what you're </v>

2997
02:06:35.560 --> 02:06:36.470
<v Speaker 4>going to throw and tell me exactly what </v>
<v Speaker 4>to do.</v>

2998
02:06:36.471 --> 02:06:37.220
<v Speaker 4>You're still going to hit me</v>

2999
02:06:37.860 --> 02:06:38.750
<v Speaker 2>big head already.</v>

3000
02:06:41.010 --> 02:06:44.800
<v Speaker 4>Like I really like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I would have died in 1980,</v>

3001
02:06:45.030 --> 02:06:47.800
<v Speaker 4>if there wasn't for all this medicine </v>
<v Speaker 4>and shit like I shouldn't be.</v>

3002
02:06:47.801 --> 02:06:49.630
<v Speaker 4>I'm one of the weak ones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really like.</v>

3003
02:06:49.631 --> 02:06:52.240
<v Speaker 4>I had my appendix ruptured.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't.</v>

3004
02:06:52.300 --> 02:06:57.300
<v Speaker 4>If it was the 18 hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would have died under like a stack of </v>

3005
02:06:57.300 --> 02:06:58.630
<v Speaker 4>blankets and say sponged off my giant </v>
<v Speaker 4>for that would've been.</v>

3006
02:06:58.631 --> 02:07:00.790
<v Speaker 4>It would've been buried out by the </v>
<v Speaker 4>outhouse.</v>

3007
02:07:01.030 --> 02:07:03.880
<v Speaker 4>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was weird.</v>

3008
02:07:03.881 --> 02:07:05.800
<v Speaker 4>It just kinda was kept hurting and </v>
<v Speaker 4>hurting.</v>

3009
02:07:05.890 --> 02:07:07.750
<v Speaker 4>How old were you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>A 12.</v>

3010
02:07:08.090 --> 02:07:09.470
<v Speaker 4>That's terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it was,</v>

3011
02:07:09.520 --> 02:07:11.860
<v Speaker 4>it was ruptured.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they didn't know what was my one day</v>

3012
02:07:11.861 --> 02:07:16.861
<v Speaker 4>I'd be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The next day I was at and my brothers </v>

3013
02:07:16.861 --> 02:07:20.340
<v Speaker 4>convinced that he knows when we were </v>
<v Speaker 4>playing baseball and football came up </v>

3014
02:07:20.340 --> 02:07:20.500
<v Speaker 4>and he said it hit me in the side.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it did.</v>

3015
02:07:21.100 --> 02:07:26.100
<v Speaker 4>I can't remember,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I just remembered my parents were </v>

3016
02:07:26.100 --> 02:07:26.100
<v Speaker 4>always just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're fine,</v>

3017
02:07:26.100 --> 02:07:26.100
<v Speaker 4>you're fine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

3018
02:07:26.100 --> 02:07:31.011
<v Speaker 4>I get hit by a car and they sent the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ambulance away and we took a cab to a </v>

3019
02:07:31.011 --> 02:07:33.280
<v Speaker 4>better hospital and my mother was going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just stay awake.</v>

3020
02:07:33.281 --> 02:07:34.260
<v Speaker 4>Just say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow.</v>

3021
02:07:35.590 --> 02:07:36.010
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

3022
02:07:36.160 --> 02:07:38.500
<v Speaker 6>Did you hear about that kid that got hit</v>
<v Speaker 6>with a disgust?</v>

3023
02:07:39.070 --> 02:07:42.580
<v Speaker 6>He got hit with disgust and died.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He got hit in the hip.</v>

3024
02:07:43.240 --> 02:07:46.330
<v Speaker 6>He got hit in the hip with a discussed </v>
<v Speaker 6>in one of dying.</v>

3025
02:07:46.860 --> 02:07:48.200
<v Speaker 6>What?</v>
<v Speaker 6>They don't know.</v>

3026
02:07:48.810 --> 02:07:51.250
<v Speaker 6>Some sort of a blood blood clot or </v>
<v Speaker 6>something.</v>

3027
02:07:51.251 --> 02:07:52.420
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But,</v>

3028
02:07:52.421 --> 02:07:52.690
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>here,</v>

3029
02:07:52.691 --> 02:07:54.910
<v Speaker 6>I'll pull up the story you want to have </v>
<v Speaker 6>you talked to them?</v>

3030
02:07:55.190 --> 02:08:00.190
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's obviously major arteries that </v>

3031
02:08:00.190 --> 02:08:00.520
<v Speaker 6>connect the top to the bottom right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3032
02:08:00.521 --> 02:08:03.520
<v Speaker 6>the blood's got to get down there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So basically you got the four.</v>

3033
02:08:03.521 --> 02:08:04.630
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>five on one side,</v>

3034
02:08:04.631 --> 02:08:09.631
<v Speaker 6>the one on one or the other.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fifteen year old kid in Texas died nine </v>

3035
02:08:09.631 --> 02:08:11.890
<v Speaker 6>days after being hit with a flying,</v>
<v Speaker 6>discuss it,</v>

3036
02:08:11.980 --> 02:08:14.890
<v Speaker 6>and he got hit in the hip to hip.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It wasn't any vitals.</v>

3037
02:08:15.440 --> 02:08:17.350
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know the questions to ask.</v>

3038
02:08:18.040 --> 02:08:23.040
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Vitals makes you sound like you know </v>

3039
02:08:23.040 --> 02:08:23.040
<v Speaker 6>what you're talking about is fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>crazy.</v>

3040
02:08:23.040 --> 02:08:23.100
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He,</v>

3041
02:08:23.530 --> 02:08:27.190
<v Speaker 6>he was in pain apparently and the pain </v>
<v Speaker 6>kept getting worse.</v>

3042
02:08:27.191 --> 02:08:32.191
<v Speaker 6>He was admitted a place under intensive </v>
<v Speaker 6>care and then dod from fucking.</v>

3043
02:08:32.620 --> 02:08:34.060
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're in pain.</v>

3044
02:08:34.140 --> 02:08:36.100
<v Speaker 6>They elaborate.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Don't tough it out.</v>

3045
02:08:36.940 --> 02:08:38.500
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>now they don't.</v>

3046
02:08:38.530 --> 02:08:40.210
<v Speaker 6>They don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It just happened.</v>

3047
02:08:40.840 --> 02:08:42.790
<v Speaker 6>The funeral,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was just a couple of days ago,</v>

3048
02:08:42.910 --> 02:08:46.270
<v Speaker 6>so I think there probably were awaiting </v>
<v Speaker 6>the results of the autopsy still,</v>

3049
02:08:47.050 --> 02:08:49.350
<v Speaker 6>but he was most likely a blood clot in </v>
<v Speaker 6>your body.</v>

3050
02:08:49.351 --> 02:08:51.460
<v Speaker 6>So fucking fragile.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you know,</v>

3051
02:08:52.240 --> 02:08:57.240
<v Speaker 6>I've seen so many people get beat up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've probably seen more people get beat </v>

3052
02:08:57.240 --> 02:09:01.201
<v Speaker 6>up than anybody in human history.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Did you know what day I'm going to the </v>

3053
02:09:01.201 --> 02:09:04.201
<v Speaker 6>hospital already?</v>
<v Speaker 6>The amount of people that I know that </v>

3054
02:09:04.201 --> 02:09:04.201
<v Speaker 6>died and they say for three days they're</v>
<v Speaker 6>going,</v>

3055
02:09:04.201 --> 02:09:05.110
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just don't feel right.</v>

3056
02:09:05.470 --> 02:09:10.470
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like when you feel that go to the go to </v>

3057
02:09:10.470 --> 02:09:10.470
<v Speaker 6>the fucking hospital,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's just like,</v>

3058
02:09:10.470 --> 02:09:11.410
<v Speaker 6>let's do a full body cat scan.</v>

3059
02:09:12.120 --> 02:09:15.100
<v Speaker 6>That's such a scab.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Find something cat scans.</v>

3060
02:09:15.520 --> 02:09:16.330
<v Speaker 6>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3061
02:09:16.331 --> 02:09:20.080
<v Speaker 6>it's been an MRI for the full body </v>
<v Speaker 6>magnetic resonance imagery,</v>

3062
02:09:20.081 --> 02:09:22.120
<v Speaker 6>cat scans for the dome.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All right,</v>

3063
02:09:22.600 --> 02:09:27.600

<v Speaker 6>I think right now do cat scans for body </v>

3064
02:09:27.600 --> 02:09:27.600
<v Speaker 6>once.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is.</v>

3065
02:09:27.600 --> 02:09:32.431
<v Speaker 6>The guy won't admit he's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They like make you pull your knees up </v>

3066
02:09:33.041 --> 02:09:37.570
<v Speaker 6>into your fucking shoulders down there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All the guys that I've seen get beat up.</v>

3067
02:09:37.870 --> 02:09:42.870
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how many people have seen a thousand </v>

3068
02:09:42.870 --> 02:09:45.031
<v Speaker 6>people get beat up?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've seen at least a thousand from all </v>

3069
02:09:45.031 --> 02:09:48.001
<v Speaker 6>the fights that I've called,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm an all the the trauma I've seen in </v>

3070
02:09:48.001 --> 02:09:50.050
<v Speaker 6>person,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so normally I don't like that shit.</v>

3071
02:09:50.051 --> 02:09:52.660
<v Speaker 6>Where after the dudes knocked out and </v>
<v Speaker 6>then the guy comes up and it's like one,</v>

3072
02:09:52.661 --> 02:09:53.200
<v Speaker 6>two,</v>
<v Speaker 6>three,</v>

3073
02:09:53.201 --> 02:09:54.470
<v Speaker 6>four,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then the breath gets there.</v>

3074
02:09:54.500 --> 02:09:56.620
<v Speaker 6>It's just a shitty referee.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what that is.</v>

3075

<v Speaker 6>I forget what fight it was.</v>

3077
02:10:00.880 --> 02:10:05.880
<v Speaker 6>I think it was when Matt Hughes had a.</v>
<v Speaker 6>what's his face in the arm bar and you </v>

3078
02:10:05.880 --> 02:10:06.110

<v Speaker 6>was like going,</v>

<v Speaker 6>the skin.</v>

3084
02:10:18.340 --> 02:10:19.000
<v Speaker 6>That is one of the.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like.</v>

<v Speaker 6>He's so filled with adrenaline and it </v>

3088
02:10:28.651 --> 02:10:32.101
<v Speaker 6>was his pride.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean he was a Jujitsu master and this </v>

3089
02:10:32.101 --> 02:10:35.161
<v Speaker 6>guy got him into Jujitsu hold and it's </v>
<v Speaker 6>basically going to break his fucking </v>

3090
02:10:35.161 --> 02:10:35.480
<v Speaker 6>arm.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Straight arm bar.</v>

<v Speaker 6>the versaclimber verse climbers one of </v>
<v Speaker 6>those things.</v>

3147
02:12:59.430 --> 02:13:01.230
<v Speaker 6>It looks like you're climbing it.</v>

3148
02:13:01.230 --> 02:13:02.000
<v Speaker 6>The,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like the,</v>

3150
02:13:07.001 --> 02:13:09.801
<v Speaker 6>go up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your left arm will go down and the same </v>

3151
02:13:09.801 --> 02:13:10.960
<v Speaker 6>with your feet and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a great exercise.</v>

3152
02:13:10.970 --> 02:13:13.510
<v Speaker 6>It's great to get it made that noise.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3155
02:13:16.591 --> 02:13:18.630
<v Speaker 6>I remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a great cardio exercise,</v>

3156
02:13:18.631 --> 02:13:21.000
<v Speaker 6>like one of the best Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Anyway,</v>

02:13:21.001 --> 02:13:25.080
<v Speaker 6>bobby or gets on this thing and he can't</v>
<v Speaker 6>really bend his knees.</v>

3158
02:13:25.350 --> 02:13:27.740
<v Speaker 6>His knees,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like this is a normal person's name.</v>

3159
02:13:27.760 --> 02:13:30.080
<v Speaker 6>They go from here to like there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's how you're,</v>

3160
02:13:30.120 --> 02:13:32.100
<v Speaker 6>you're nigos his knee goes like this</v>

3161
02:13:32.220 --> 02:13:33.910
<v Speaker 1>clink clink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

3162
02:13:34.080 --> 02:13:36.540
<v Speaker 1>he gets like 15 degrees of movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3163
02:13:36.570 --> 02:13:38.220
<v Speaker 1>very little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like bone on bone.</v>

3164
02:13:38.400 --> 02:13:40.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we used to have to pick him up,</v>

3165
02:13:41.280 --> 02:13:44.250
<v Speaker 1>pick him up and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get his feet into the thing.</v>

3166
02:13:44.251 --> 02:13:46.320
<v Speaker 1>And then you had to be there when he </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to get off of it,</v>

3167
02:13:46.321 --> 02:13:51.321
<v Speaker 1>as well as like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his knees would not bend correctly and </v>

3168
02:13:51.321 --> 02:13:51.810
<v Speaker 1>when he was playing racquetball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would just fall down,</v>

3169
02:13:52.020 --> 02:13:55.980
<v Speaker 1>like he would play racquetball and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>would like go for a ball and just fall.</v>

3170
02:13:56.310 --> 02:13:58.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean he just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't even try to stop it.</v>

3171
02:13:58.770 --> 02:14:00.210
<v Speaker 1>He would just allow themselves to fall</v>

3172
02:14:00.390 --> 02:14:01.830
<v Speaker 2>first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sam Kennison not bother your.</v>

3173
02:14:01.850 --> 02:14:02.680
<v Speaker 2>He just killed me.</v>

3174
02:14:02.740 --> 02:14:03.370
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

3175
02:14:03.371 --> 02:14:06.060
<v Speaker 1>Bob Yoga was a great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He ate.</v>

3176
02:14:06.190 --> 02:14:11.190
<v Speaker 1>He had the same issue that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very good friend of mine has where </v>

3177
02:14:11.190 --> 02:14:12.100
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did those operations back then.</v>

3178
02:14:12.220 --> 02:14:14.380
<v Speaker 1>First of all these to cut you open like </v>
<v Speaker 1>a salmon.</v>

3179
02:14:14.740 --> 02:14:19.740
<v Speaker 1>They would just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would just open you and then they </v>

3180
02:14:19.740 --> 02:14:19.930
<v Speaker 1>would go into the hamstrings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They pull the hamstrings out,</v>

3181
02:14:19.960 --> 02:14:23.020
<v Speaker 1>take a big chunk of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then try to reconstruct your knee.</v>

3182
02:14:23.021 --> 02:14:27.100
<v Speaker 1>And it would almost always blow out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So bobby had so many fucking surgeries,</v>

3183
02:14:27.101 --> 02:14:29.120
<v Speaker 1>his knees just an up and down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both</v>

3184
02:14:29.580 --> 02:14:32.000
<v Speaker 2>those guys out on the golf course when </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were shorts,</v>

3185
02:14:32.001 --> 02:14:35.210
<v Speaker 2>where they have that Frankenstein car </v>
<v Speaker 2>right over the Patella.</v>

3186
02:14:35.390 --> 02:14:36.050
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have that.</v>

3187
02:14:36.290 --> 02:14:36.850
<v Speaker 2>You have that?</v>

3188
02:14:36.890 --> 02:14:38.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's my acl.</v>

3189
02:14:38.300 --> 02:14:39.800
<v Speaker 1>I had to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that one doesn't hurt at all.</v>

3190
02:14:39.950 --> 02:14:43.520
<v Speaker 1>I had a Patella that's actually more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than the new school was on the side.</v>

3191
02:14:43.850 --> 02:14:48.850
<v Speaker 1>The acl is in the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The acl is what connects the two </v>

3192
02:14:48.850 --> 02:14:48.980
<v Speaker 1>together and keeps them from moving </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward and backward.</v>

3193
02:14:49.340 --> 02:14:53.210
<v Speaker 1>And there's obviously the outside and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of different things,</v>

3194
02:14:53.211 --> 02:14:55.130
<v Speaker 1>but one of the ways that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3195
02:14:55.140 --> 02:14:59.780
<v Speaker 1>they fixed the acl joint is they take a </v>
<v Speaker 1>piece of the Patella tendon joint,</v>

3196
02:14:59.781 --> 02:15:02.540
<v Speaker 1>which is the front one which goes from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the kneecap down.</v>

3197
02:15:02.960 --> 02:15:05.000
<v Speaker 1>They take a slice of that because it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>big thick one.</v>

3198
02:15:05.001 --> 02:15:08.270
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen a cadaver?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very fit and you don't need it all.</v>

3199
02:15:08.330 --> 02:15:13.330
<v Speaker 1>So they take a strip of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>open you up and they open you up and </v>

3200
02:15:15.501 --> 02:15:20.501
<v Speaker 1>then they screw it in place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I have a screw in one and then </v>

3201
02:15:20.501 --> 02:15:21.830
<v Speaker 1>another screw in another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still in.</v>

3202
02:15:21.831 --> 02:15:24.210
<v Speaker 1>The screws are still in there because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like you go through security</v>

3203
02:15:24.211 --> 02:15:25.460
<v Speaker 1>at the airport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't beep,</v>

3204
02:15:25.760 --> 02:15:27.930
<v Speaker 1>but it shows up in an MRI.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I to tell them,</v>

3205
02:15:27.980 --> 02:15:29.650
<v Speaker 1>you stand there and do the Jay z thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3206
02:15:29.651 --> 02:15:31.280
<v Speaker 1>I do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't do it.</v>

3207
02:15:31.340 --> 02:15:33.890
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to worry about that one </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that one isn't even radiation.</v>

3208
02:15:33.891 --> 02:15:35.620
<v Speaker 1>That's actually radio waves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they'll look.</v>

3209
02:15:35.910 --> 02:15:39.720
<v Speaker 2>This is the sharp metal object.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anybody 12 years or younger they go,</v>

3210
02:15:39.721 --> 02:15:41.070
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go through the old school one.</v>

3211
02:15:41.910 --> 02:15:42.810
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is that?</v>

3212
02:15:42.811 --> 02:15:45.510
<v Speaker 2>Because that will disrupt him hitting </v>
<v Speaker 2>puberty.</v>

3213
02:15:45.511 --> 02:15:46.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do.</v>

3214
02:15:47.220 --> 02:15:49.680
<v Speaker 2>It's because it's their little kid parts</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably.</v>

3215
02:15:50.460 --> 02:15:54.510
<v Speaker 2>Well they like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd probably illegal to see a picture</v>

3216
02:15:54.511 --> 02:15:55.910
<v Speaker 2>of your Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3217
02:15:55.920 --> 02:15:57.030
<v Speaker 2>is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3218
02:15:57.050 --> 02:16:02.050
<v Speaker 1>Because you know a lot of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially those naked imagery things </v>

3219
02:16:02.050 --> 02:16:02.050
<v Speaker 1>like that was the thing you were getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>like</v>

3220

<v Speaker 2>You can see that deck.</v>

3221
02:16:05.221 --> 02:16:06.630
<v Speaker 2>That's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's still under age.</v>

3222
02:16:07.320 --> 02:16:12.320
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they just get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get nervous when someones too </v>

3223
02:16:12.320 --> 02:16:12.320
<v Speaker 2>young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3224
02:16:12.320 --> 02:16:13.200
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just saw that.</v>

3225
02:16:13.201 --> 02:16:14.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you hit me with enough shit,</v>

3226
02:16:14.701 --> 02:16:16.470
<v Speaker 2>the fucking kill him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to go through it.</v>

3227
02:16:16.950 --> 02:16:19.050
<v Speaker 2>I always go through the pat down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get a</v>

3228
02:16:19.050 --> 02:16:21.030
<v Speaker 1>pat down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always Ari Shaffir doesn't.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He goes to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets a pat down and he berates them.</v>

3230
02:16:23.500 --> 02:16:26.340
<v Speaker 1>Girls are thieves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thieves and losers and idiots.</v>

3231
02:16:26.620 --> 02:16:29.010
<v Speaker 1>Like I've never seen anything like he </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets angry at.</v>

3232
02:16:29.110 --> 02:16:34.110
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's backed off of it and he's decided </v>

3233
02:16:34.110 --> 02:16:36.421
<v Speaker 1>now to just be polite but object and </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell them there's other ways to make a </v>

3234
02:16:36.421 --> 02:16:36.490
<v Speaker 1>living.</v>

<v Speaker 1>but you know what,</v>

3271
02:17:55.780 --> 02:18:00.780
<v Speaker 1>that's because most of them are just </v>
<v Speaker 1>regular folks work in Shitty jobs and </v>

3272
02:18:01.630 --> 02:18:03.520

<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

3275
02:18:10.300 --> 02:18:10.870
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

3276
02:18:11.050 --> 02:18:16.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right before nine slash 11 I was going </v>

3277
02:18:16.050 --> 02:18:18.451
<v Speaker 2>through lax and I was like taking a red </v>
<v Speaker 2>eye and a James Brown was on the radio </v>

3278
02:18:20.360 --> 02:18:25.360
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that get opened up and the girl was </v>

3279
02:18:25.360 --> 02:18:28.891
<v Speaker 2>sitting there dancing and singing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>song and I fucking shot or a look and I </v>

3280
02:18:28.891 --> 02:18:30.310
<v Speaker 2>think she thought I was looking at her </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a racist way.</v>

3281
02:18:30.370 --> 02:18:32.140
<v Speaker 2>I was more looking like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you understand that?</v>

3282
02:18:32.141 --> 02:18:37.120
<v Speaker 2>Like my life is in your hands and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting over here fucking sliding across</v>

3283
02:18:37.121 --> 02:18:38.890
<v Speaker 2>the floor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck are you doing?</v>

3284
02:18:39.370 --> 02:18:41.530
<v Speaker 2>And then a few weeks later that bullshit</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>

3285
02:18:41.810 --> 02:18:43.420
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tsa person was doing that.</v>

<v Speaker 2>defiantly singing the song staring at me</v>

3287
02:18:46.781 --> 02:18:48.400
<v Speaker 2>because she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she caught my vibe.</v>

3288
02:18:48.401 --> 02:18:50.380
<v Speaker 2>Like what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then a few weeks later,</v>

3289
02:18:50.590 --> 02:18:52.660
<v Speaker 2>nine slash 11 happens and then they got </v>
<v Speaker 2>all these guys.</v>

3290
02:18:52.661 --> 02:18:53.970
<v Speaker 2>Remember they had the fucking guys with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>

3291
02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:55.540
<v Speaker 2>It looked like we were in Israel for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>second.</v>

3292
02:18:55.590 --> 02:18:59.410
<v Speaker 2>Now those guys have gone away and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>the exact same jerk offs.</v>

3293
02:19:00.730 --> 02:19:05.730
<v Speaker 2>You know that all jerk offs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's enough dead weight come on </v>

3294
02:19:05.730 --> 02:19:06.250
<v Speaker 2>Tsa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3295
02:19:06.700 --> 02:19:08.590
<v Speaker 2>there's some people that shouldn't be on</v>
<v Speaker 2>this squad.</v>

3296
02:19:08.830 --> 02:19:09.830
<v Speaker 2>There's enough like,</v>

3297
02:19:09.970 --> 02:19:14.970
<v Speaker 1>well they don't get paid that much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you're going to get people </v>

3298
02:19:14.970 --> 02:19:17.341
<v Speaker 1>that work for essentially the same wages</v>
<v Speaker 1>that someone does and they work pretty </v>

3299
02:19:17.341 --> 02:19:17.341
<v Speaker 1>fast,</v>

3300
02:19:17.341 --> 02:19:21.120
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's really truly gave a shit about </v>

3301
02:19:21.120 --> 02:19:25.141
<v Speaker 2>your safety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would get who that guy on my plane </v>

3302
02:19:25.141 --> 02:19:25.141
<v Speaker 2>was pretending to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They.</v>

3303
02:19:25.141 --> 02:19:28.160
<v Speaker 2>They would get that guy in red wood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stand down.</v>

3304
02:19:28.680 --> 02:19:30.740
<v Speaker 5>What you would feel that Desert Eagle </v>
<v Speaker 5>vibe.</v>

3305
02:19:32.780 --> 02:19:33.280
<v Speaker 5>They do.</v>

3306
02:19:34.120 --> 02:19:35.010
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did they care?</v>

3307
02:19:35.011 --> 02:19:40.011
<v Speaker 1>They care is exactly as much as they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to and if it costs them more to </v>

3308
02:19:40.011 --> 02:19:41.570
<v Speaker 1>make you more safe and not really </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in it,</v>

3309
02:19:41.820 --> 02:19:45.330
<v Speaker 1>what they're interested in doing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>spend the minimum amount of money to get</v>

3310
02:19:45.331 --> 02:19:48.930
<v Speaker 1>people to shut the fuck up and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality is you're not going to get a lot</v>

3311
02:19:48.931 --> 02:19:53.931
<v Speaker 1>of fucking attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get an occasional one </v>

3312
02:19:53.931 --> 02:19:56.901
<v Speaker 1>every decade or so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to have some shit go down </v>

3313
02:19:56.901 --> 02:19:56.901
<v Speaker 1>and you could make</v>

3314
02:19:56.901 --> 02:20:01.620
<v Speaker 5>fuck load of profit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm more concerned that they're now </v>

3315
02:20:01.620 --> 02:20:01.620
<v Speaker 5>outsourcing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I saw,</v>

3316
02:20:01.620 --> 02:20:02.970
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>once again saw this,</v>

3317
02:20:03.380 --> 02:20:08.380
<v Speaker 5>didn't research what are they </v>
<v Speaker 5>outsourcing or bringing in an Indian </v>

3318
02:20:08.380 --> 02:20:08.380
<v Speaker 5>people</v>

3319
02:20:08.380 --> 02:20:08.860
<v Speaker 4>just so many miles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to rebuild the jet engine.</v>

3320
02:20:09.790 --> 02:20:13.480
<v Speaker 4>They're outsourcing it outside of this </v>
<v Speaker 4>country and the FDA can't regulate it.</v>

3321
02:20:14.180 --> 02:20:15.580

<v Speaker 4>jet engine forks to suck,</v>

02:20:24.790 --> 02:20:28.950
<v Speaker 4>You compress it and then you mix it with</v>
<v Speaker 4>the jet fuel and it fucking explodes and</v>

3326
02:20:28.951 --> 02:20:33.951

3370
02:22:26.040 --> 02:22:28.890
<v Speaker 6>Good enough for him to rub one out.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Probably that's probably how I blew his </v>

<v Speaker 4>fell backwards down the stairs and his </v>
<v Speaker 4>legs were pulling it up and the blood </v>

<v Speaker 2>This,</v>

3456

<v Speaker 2>this site is totally secure with those </v>
<v Speaker 2>hacker fuckers isn't.</v>

3457
02:26:01.770 --> 02:26:06.770
<v Speaker 2>Nothing's ever secure anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy who built it has some sort of </v>

3458
02:26:06.770 --> 02:26:09.340
<v Speaker 2>backdoor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how he gets pussy the back door.</v>

3459
02:26:11.260 --> 02:26:11.920
<v Speaker 2>The back door</v>

3460
02:26:11.960 --> 02:26:13.430
<v Speaker 1>happened with us at a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on it,</v>

3461
02:26:13.550 --> 02:26:16.640
<v Speaker 1>at the audit.com</v>
<v Speaker 1>is we uh,</v>

3462
02:26:16.670 --> 02:26:19.190
<v Speaker 1>hired a guy to do some coding for us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the,</v>

3463
02:26:19.191 --> 02:26:20.240
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the,</v>

3464
02:26:20.380 --> 02:26:25.350
<v Speaker 1>like a gift certificates and stuff like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that for the website and to set it up so</v>

3465
02:26:25.380 --> 02:26:30.380
<v Speaker 1>you can gift people things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this guy decided to outsource the </v>

3466
02:26:30.741 --> 02:26:35.741
<v Speaker 1>coding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we didn't even know we thought that </v>

3467
02:26:35.741 --> 02:26:36.620
<v Speaker 1>this guy who was a reliable guy was </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to do the coding,</v>

3468
02:26:36.770 --> 02:26:39.890
<v Speaker 1>but what he did was he got his online </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend from Vietnam,</v>

3469
02:26:40.130 --> 02:26:44.210
<v Speaker 1>gave him the password to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the servers and allowed him to do the</v>

3470
02:26:44.211 --> 02:26:49.211
<v Speaker 1>coding and this guy went in and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>started downloading all the credit card </v>

3471
02:26:49.211 --> 02:26:53.351
<v Speaker 1>information and so the FBI we had to </v>
<v Speaker 1>bringing the FBI to find out and it went</v>

3472
02:26:53.571 --> 02:26:58.571
<v Speaker 1>through this guy and we found out that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's apparently like super common </v>

3473
02:26:58.571 --> 02:26:59.180
<v Speaker 1>because if you're paying this guy x </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount per hour,</v>

3474
02:26:59.420 --> 02:27:01.480
<v Speaker 1>he can go to Vietnam and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey vic,</v>

3475
02:27:01.550 --> 02:27:03.410
<v Speaker 1>my Vietnamese friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you a,</v>

3476
02:27:03.500 --> 02:27:08.500

<v Speaker 1>half that you do all the work so it's </v>

3477
02:27:08.500 --> 02:27:08.690
<v Speaker 1>got kicks back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>collects fat checks,</v>

3478
02:27:08.700 --> 02:27:11.510
<v Speaker 1>doesn't do a goddamn thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's apparently super common.</v>

3479
02:27:11.540 --> 02:27:12.380
<v Speaker 1>This outsourcing.</v>

3480
02:27:12.510 --> 02:27:17.510
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why you never never used your </v>

3481
02:27:17.510 --> 02:27:17.510
<v Speaker 4>debit card ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really.</v>

<v Speaker 4>That's almost to a credit card.</v>

3484
02:27:21.031 --> 02:27:22.590
<v Speaker 4>Credit card.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the house's money.</v>

3485
02:27:22.591 --> 02:27:24.240
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying to rack it all the way </v>
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>

3486
02:27:24.241 --> 02:27:29.241
<v Speaker 4>I got a buddy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>might've prosecutes identity theft and </v>

3487
02:27:29.241 --> 02:27:29.241

<v Speaker 4>If someone's going to double swipe it,</v>

3490
02:27:35.221 --> 02:27:37.830
<v Speaker 4>you want it to be their money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so then they call up and they're like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

3494
02:27:45.301 --> 02:27:50.301

<v Speaker 4>you have to go down to the fucking bank </v>

3495
02:27:50.301 --> 02:27:52.971
<v Speaker 4>and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't spend 65 bucks at an auto zone </v>

3496
02:27:52.971 --> 02:27:52.971
<v Speaker 4>and all of that shit and you have to.</v>

3497
02:27:52.971 --> 02:27:55.260
<v Speaker 4>You have to go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rather than it being a quick phone call,</v>

3498
02:27:55.350 --> 02:27:57.540
<v Speaker 4>you have to go through all of this </v>
<v Speaker 4>bullshit.</v>

3499
02:27:57.570 --> 02:28:00.120
<v Speaker 4>So it's still protected by the Visa </v>
<v Speaker 4>Card.</v>

3500
02:28:00.150 --> 02:28:03.180

3504
02:28:09.450 --> 02:28:14.450
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's definitely better to do it through </v>

3505
02:28:14.450 --> 02:28:14.450
<v Speaker 4>American Express or someone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a phone call.</v>

<v Speaker 6>It was at a gas station because I didn't</v>

3512
02:28:27.201 --> 02:28:32.201
<v Speaker 6>use it for anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then all of a sudden I started </v>

<v Speaker 6>getting these messages were they were </v>
<v Speaker 6>saying or were you buying chocolate?</v>

<v Speaker 6>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what?</v>

3515
02:28:34.990 --> 02:28:35.770
<v Speaker 6>That's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 6>Let's hit their first.</v>

3523
02:28:50.180 --> 02:28:55.180
<v Speaker 6>Well No.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The reason why they do that is to get </v>

3524
02:28:55.180 --> 02:28:55.180
<v Speaker 6>gift certificates.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what they were doing.</v>

3525
02:28:55.180 --> 02:28:55.490
<v Speaker 6>They were getting gift.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So when they get the money and then they</v>

3526
02:28:55.491 --> 02:28:56.200
<v Speaker 6>say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hey man,</v>

3527
02:28:56.960 --> 02:28:59.570
<v Speaker 6>I'm doing the black voice and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 6>know why I go to a white guy,</v>

3528

<v Speaker 6>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>would you like $500 worth of Godiva </v>

3529
02:29:04.600 --> 02:29:06.290
<v Speaker 6>chocolates for 50 bucks?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so they could sell that for 50 bucks</v>

3530
02:29:06.350 --> 02:29:07.880
<v Speaker 6>on Ebay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's another thing.</v>

3531
02:29:07.910 --> 02:29:08.890
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's a good one too</v>

3532
02:29:09.640 --> 02:29:12.820
<v Speaker 7>is they use the gift certificate and </v>
<v Speaker 7>they don't use all of it and they try to</v>

3533
02:29:12.821 --> 02:29:13.630
<v Speaker 7>get the change back.</v>

3534
02:29:13.670 --> 02:29:15.450
<v Speaker 6>Can you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can in some places,</v>

3535
02:29:15.451 --> 02:29:16.440
<v Speaker 6>some places you could do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3536
02:29:16.570 --> 02:29:17.570
<v Speaker 6>you can.</v>
<v Speaker 6>In some places.</v>

3537
02:29:17.571 --> 02:29:20.030
<v Speaker 6>I've seen people do that before.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can do that in some ways,</v>

3538
02:29:20.031 --> 02:29:22.130
<v Speaker 6>but a lot of ways they said no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a store credit.</v>

3539
02:29:22.170 --> 02:29:27.170
<v Speaker 7>I got a buddy who's a lawyer whenever I </v>
<v Speaker 7>go into the time where he prosecutes </v>

3540
02:29:27.170 --> 02:29:27.620
<v Speaker 7>because he's the shit I,</v>

3544
02:29:33.210 --> 02:29:34.350
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It must be weird though,</v>

3545
02:29:34.360 --> 02:29:36.510
<v Speaker 6>but what have you seen?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You've seen like a real one,</v>

02:29:52.110 --> 02:29:54.870
<v Speaker 7>And the dude literally goes like </v>
<v Speaker 7>handsomeness.</v>

3552
02:29:54.871 --> 02:29:56.280

<v Speaker 7>do you recognize this?</v>

3553
02:29:56.880 --> 02:29:58.650
<v Speaker 7>And he looks at the piece of paper and </v>
<v Speaker 7>he goes out,</v>

3554
02:29:58.710 --> 02:30:00.060

<v Speaker 7>then it's almost like a comedy show to </v>

3564
02:30:17.361 --> 02:30:17.361
<v Speaker 7>start off with the fucking open </v>

3566
02:30:22.240 --> 02:30:25.761

<v Speaker 7>Every time you exhale,</v>

3593
02:31:13.720 --> 02:31:18.720
<v Speaker 7>the prosecution just gets a little </v>
<v Speaker 7>tighter and tighter and you see the </v>

3594
02:31:18.720 --> 02:31:20.100
<v Speaker 7>person sitting at their body language.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're all confident and 10 is an</v>

<v Speaker 4>Hard to deny somebody freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I'll ever do it again </v>

3600
02:31:35.600 --> 02:31:39.621

<v Speaker 4>in Italy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was acquitted because there was some</v>

3604
02:31:49.921 --> 02:31:54.921
<v Speaker 4>sort of a problem with the evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now they're trying to retire and now </v>

<v Speaker 4>is that doable?</v>

3662
02:34:19.080 --> 02:34:21.220
<v Speaker 5>Doable.</v>

3665
02:34:29.150 --> 02:34:30.760
<v Speaker 5>where people have to live in the woods </v>
<v Speaker 5>like those Alaska,</v>

3666
02:34:30.790 --> 02:34:35.790
<v Speaker 5>the last frontier type shows we're </v>
<v Speaker 5>picking out like in 1963 snowmobile all </v>

<v Speaker 5>They are literally burning 3000 calories</v>

3669
02:34:52.750 --> 02:34:55.070
<v Speaker 5>to get five,</v>
<v Speaker 5>1500.</v>

3670
02:34:55.840 --> 02:34:59.500
<v Speaker 5>How do you stay?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How you stay nourished?</v>

3671
02:34:59.710 --> 02:35:01.580
<v Speaker 5>It's very hard when it's really cold.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now you,</v>

3672
02:35:01.581 --> 02:35:06.581
<v Speaker 5>you get so fucking hungry because your </v>
<v Speaker 5>body burns off so much fuel just to try </v>

3673
02:35:06.581 --> 02:35:06.581
<v Speaker 5>to stay warm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

3674
02:35:06.710 --> 02:35:07.510
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 5>You're telling me what to do.</v>

3678
02:35:13.780 --> 02:35:18.780
<v Speaker 5>I'll do it now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what you do is you just stick people </v>

3679
02:35:18.780 --> 02:35:19.630
<v Speaker 5>in these extreme conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like when it's snowing out near a mall.</v>

3680
02:35:19.690 --> 02:35:21.520
<v Speaker 5>I mean you're right near Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's an ambulance there,</v>

3681
02:35:21.521 --> 02:35:26.521
<v Speaker 5>but he just make him keep going up and </v>
<v Speaker 5>down the hill like as far as that guy </v>

3684
02:35:28.541 --> 02:35:30.370
<v Speaker 5>That's right there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can literally see a JC penny,</v>

3685
02:35:30.371 --> 02:35:33.260
<v Speaker 5>but we're not fucking letting you back </v>
<v Speaker 5>until you go up and down this mountain a</v>

3686
02:35:33.270 --> 02:35:34.960
<v Speaker 5>Zillion fucking times and that you have </v>
<v Speaker 5>though.</v>

3687
02:35:34.961 --> 02:35:37.390
<v Speaker 5>They'll burn all that stuff and then you</v>
<v Speaker 5>take them over to the orange.</v>

3688
02:35:37.391 --> 02:35:42.391
<v Speaker 5>Julius [inaudible] sounds like prison.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That doesn't sound like a real workout </v>

3689
02:35:42.391 --> 02:35:44.050
<v Speaker 5>exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Video is slowly working towards that.</v>

3690
02:35:44.750 --> 02:35:49.750
<v Speaker 5>Like this is stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What people are doing is they're just </v>

3691
02:35:49.750 --> 02:35:52.771
<v Speaker 5>blowing out their joints.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if you just knew how to fucking </v>

<v Speaker 5>replacement.</v>

3694
02:35:54.581 --> 02:35:57.100
<v Speaker 5>You don't go on a fucking elliptical in </v>
<v Speaker 5>for an hour straight.</v>

3695

<v Speaker 5>shitty advice.</v>

3701

<v Speaker 1>I am with.</v>

3735
02:37:34.140 --> 02:37:39.140
<v Speaker 1>The idea is to give your body these a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bioidentical hormones that are the same </v>

3736
02:37:39.451 --> 02:37:44.100
<v Speaker 1>level of the hormones when you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>young and it gets so much more energy.</v>

02:37:44.160 --> 02:37:45.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing how much better you feel.</v>

3738
02:37:45.900 --> 02:37:48.180
<v Speaker 1>It's a very controversial thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people say,</v>

3739
02:37:48.181 --> 02:37:50.550
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should be worried about what happens</v>

3740
02:37:51.180 --> 02:37:53.130
<v Speaker 1>to your body or be at the forefront of </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>

3741
02:37:53.250 --> 02:37:58.250
<v Speaker 1>but you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have been doing this for a long </v>

3742
02:37:58.250 --> 02:37:58.250
<v Speaker 1>fucking time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you have to worry about as abuse,</v>

3743
02:37:58.250 --> 02:38:02.600
<v Speaker 1>like anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as the most important thing is </v>

3744
02:38:02.600 --> 02:38:04.611
<v Speaker 1>you get your blood work done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go do it with an ethical doctor and you </v>

3745
02:38:04.611 --> 02:38:06.800
<v Speaker 1>can't be one of those people that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>outsource is your blood tests like that.</v>

3746
02:38:08.240 --> 02:38:10.950
<v Speaker 1>It's local,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to worry about,</v>

3747
02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:12.300
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's clean.</v>

3748
02:38:13.050 --> 02:38:15.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to worry about abuse.</v>

3749
02:38:15.450 --> 02:38:18.150
<v Speaker 1>If a person's impulsive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they essentially,</v>

3750
02:38:18.151 --> 02:38:21.180
<v Speaker 1>they'll give you this testosterone cream</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you rub on you.</v>

3751
02:38:21.330 --> 02:38:26.330
<v Speaker 1>If you're a nut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just fucking take four times that </v>

3752
02:38:26.330 --> 02:38:26.330
<v Speaker 1>dose and rub it on yourself and all of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sudden you're like,</v>

3753
02:38:27.280 --> 02:38:28.720
<v Speaker 1>Dick's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a fucking crowbar.</v>

3754
02:38:28.730 --> 02:38:33.730
<v Speaker 1>And you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're red lining your adrenal system </v>

3755
02:38:33.730 --> 02:38:33.730
<v Speaker 1>and your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

3756
02:38:33.730 --> 02:38:33.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your endocrine system.</v>

3757
02:38:33.780 --> 02:38:38.780
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to make sure that you do </v>

3758
02:38:38.780 --> 02:38:38.780
<v Speaker 1>exactly what you're supposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like.</v>

3759
02:38:38.780 --> 02:38:41.280
<v Speaker 1>It's very minimum doses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the way Keith Richards does blow.</v>

3760
02:38:41.640 --> 02:38:43.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He probably like legend.</v>

3761
02:38:44.020 --> 02:38:45.250
<v Speaker 4>Barely though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We used to be.</v>

3762

3764
02:38:47.630 --> 02:38:49.070
<v Speaker 4>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had that bad period.</v>

3765
02:38:49.400 --> 02:38:51.500
<v Speaker 4>And that just followed me forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

3766
02:38:51.680 --> 02:38:53.150
<v Speaker 4>all these people who died,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he goes,</v>

3767
02:38:53.300 --> 02:38:57.320
<v Speaker 4>you don't do a line of coke and just sit</v>
<v Speaker 4>there and do another one.</v>

3768
02:38:57.321 --> 02:38:58.660
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you walk around and Blah Blah.</v>

3769
02:38:58.661 --> 02:38:59.890
<v Speaker 4>A couple more hours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You take another.</v>

3770
02:38:59.910 --> 02:39:01.310
<v Speaker 4>Like he's very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3771
02:39:01.730 --> 02:39:04.480

<v Speaker 4>Slashes book was another one where he,</v>

3772
02:39:04.550 --> 02:39:07.190
<v Speaker 4>he knew how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he was,</v>

3773
02:39:07.310 --> 02:39:12.310
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some people just use comedy as a </v>

3774
02:39:12.310 --> 02:39:13.781
<v Speaker 4>stepping stone to get to acting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then there's people who just love </v>

3775
02:39:13.781 --> 02:39:13.781
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I love seeing the mic stand,</v>

3776
02:39:13.781 --> 02:39:17.981
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when there's nobody in there and it's </v>

3777
02:39:17.981 --> 02:39:17.981
<v Speaker 4>lit and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I got hurt.</v>

3778
02:39:17.981 --> 02:39:19.280
<v Speaker 4>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Slash it gets a junkie.</v>

3779
02:39:19.281 --> 02:39:21.740
<v Speaker 4>Like I was reading it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was like he made it sound.</v>

3780
02:39:22.600 --> 02:39:23.870
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love the whole thing.</v>

3781
02:39:23.871 --> 02:39:25.870
<v Speaker 4>I'd love copying the stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hope I'm not misquoting,</v>

3782
02:39:25.910 --> 02:39:30.910
<v Speaker 4>but it was basically the gist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love the whole cooking it up and he's </v>

3783
02:39:30.910 --> 02:39:30.910
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he goes,</v>

3784
02:39:30.910 --> 02:39:33.610
<v Speaker 4>I was really into it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it seemed like because you know,</v>

3785
02:39:33.680 --> 02:39:36.380
<v Speaker 4>it's Kinda like a guy who just sits down</v>
<v Speaker 4>and plays drums and a guy could actually</v>

3786
02:39:36.560 --> 02:39:39.470
<v Speaker 4>tune them and build a car,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

3787
02:39:40.630 --> 02:39:41.060
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3788
02:39:41.070 --> 02:39:42.180
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You make a lot of sense.</v>

3789
02:39:42.181 --> 02:39:45.170
<v Speaker 1>And it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you're a guy who is well,</v>

3790
02:39:45.180 --> 02:39:47.730
<v Speaker 1>like for us stand up comics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not like,</v>

3791
02:39:47.731 --> 02:39:49.110
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>history of heroin use,</v>

3792
02:39:49.380 --> 02:39:51.840
<v Speaker 1>but for musicians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ,</v>

3793
02:39:51.841 --> 02:39:53.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean how many great musicians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kurt cobain,</v>

3794
02:39:53.971 --> 02:39:54.810
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

3795
02:39:54.840 --> 02:39:57.660
<v Speaker 1>How many great musicians also had heroin</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>

3796
02:39:57.870 --> 02:40:00.780
<v Speaker 1>And I think there's a connection there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the guy from Alice and chains.</v>

3797
02:40:00.781 --> 02:40:03.000
<v Speaker 1>Layne Staley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>huge heroin addict.</v>

3798
02:40:03.001 --> 02:40:05.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's so many great musicians </v>
<v Speaker 1>that were also</v>

3799
02:40:06.580 --> 02:40:08.830
<v Speaker 4>chunk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why you would ever fuck at this point.</v>

3802
02:40:13.200 --> 02:40:14.040
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

3803
02:40:14.080 --> 02:40:17.280
<v Speaker 6>it's supposed to be an unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 6>amazing feeling.</v>

3804
02:40:17.350 --> 02:40:17.840
<v Speaker 6>It's really fun.</v>

<v Speaker 6>didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>didn't stand up.</v>

3810

<v Speaker 6>Have a bit about something along those </v>
<v Speaker 6>lines.</v>

<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like when it doesn't matter anymore.</v>

<v Speaker 6>I forgot,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

3816
02:40:38.031 --> 02:40:40.450
<v Speaker 6>Maybe you stand on,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I've been told by for this,</v>

3817
02:40:40.490 --> 02:40:45.490
<v Speaker 6>we should go back to this elliptical </v>
<v Speaker 6>thing so people know I'm for surgeons </v>

3818
02:40:45.490 --> 02:40:49.391
<v Speaker 6>that looked in the x rays and say I have</v>
<v Speaker 6>osteoarthritis and need a total hip </v>

<v Speaker 6>times a week,</v>

3822
02:40:51.861 --> 02:40:54.200

<v Speaker 6>The question is should I have,</v>

3823
02:40:54.980 --> 02:40:56.810
<v Speaker 6>should I stop using the elliptical </v>

3826
02:41:00.760 --> 02:41:01.930
<v Speaker 6>And yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is um,</v>

3827

<v Speaker 6>Why elliptical machines are bad for your</v>
<v Speaker 6>body hears it says popular piece of </v>

3831
02:41:15.441 --> 02:41:20.441

3832
02:41:22.641 --> 02:41:27.641
<v Speaker 6>over arrested number of calories.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Calories burned in a workout by 31 </v>

3833
02:41:27.641 --> 02:41:27.641
<v Speaker 6>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Huh?</v>

02:41:29.270 --> 02:41:31.180
<v Speaker 6>calories.</v>

<v Speaker 6>fact that you can dance during a shell </v>

<v Speaker 7>But there's going to be a price you have</v>
<v Speaker 7>to pay if you want a full head of hair.</v>

3891
02:43:42.691 --> 02:43:44.130
<v Speaker 7>I think like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's like,</v>

3892
02:43:44.131 --> 02:43:46.380
<v Speaker 7>would you take a pill to get your hair </v>
<v Speaker 7>back?</v>

3893
02:43:46.381 --> 02:43:51.381
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>That like they strap you down and it's </v>

3894
02:43:51.381 --> 02:43:55.521
<v Speaker 7>like for 90 seconds it's going to feel </v>
<v Speaker 7>like you're fucking head's on fire is </v>

3895
02:43:55.521 --> 02:43:56.890
<v Speaker 7>that Shit said shit grows.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But at the end you're going to have like</v>

3896
02:43:56.900 --> 02:43:57.060
<v Speaker 7>games</v>

3897
02:43:57.210 --> 02:43:59.370
<v Speaker 6>show homes it 90 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3898
02:43:59.420 --> 02:44:01.650
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've been on fire.</v>

3899
02:44:01.730 --> 02:44:06.730
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would definitely do it because first </v>

3900
02:44:06.730 --> 02:44:08.721
<v Speaker 6>of all,</v>
<v Speaker 6>90 seconds I would want to know like </v>

3901
02:44:08.721 --> 02:44:09.130
<v Speaker 6>what they think hair on fire would feel </v>
<v Speaker 6>like.</v>

3902
02:44:10.220 --> 02:44:14.250
<v Speaker 6>It would feel like everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everything else is so overrated.</v>

3903
02:44:14.251 --> 02:44:16.230
<v Speaker 6>Like what people talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like how much things hurt.</v>

3904
02:44:16.350 --> 02:44:21.350
<v Speaker 6>Like tattoos.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I fell asleep getting tattooed to </v>

3905
02:44:21.350 --> 02:44:24.560
<v Speaker 6>tattoos and not that painful.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is about getting a butterfly and </v>

3906
02:44:24.560 --> 02:44:26.610
<v Speaker 6>your ass.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've talked to my arms are sleeves.</v>

3907
02:44:26.660 --> 02:44:29.180
<v Speaker 6>I fell asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not Hard,</v>

3908
02:44:29.190 --> 02:44:30.870
<v Speaker 6>but what I'm saying is if you ask some </v>
<v Speaker 6>people,</v>

3909
02:44:30.871 --> 02:44:31.530
<v Speaker 6>they go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh my God,</v>

3910
02:44:31.531 --> 02:44:34.200
<v Speaker 6>it's so painful,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's not really that painful.</v>

3911
02:44:35.040 --> 02:44:39.540
<v Speaker 6>Laser Tattoo removal supposed to be more</v>
<v Speaker 6>painful than tattooing itself.</v>

3912
02:44:39.960 --> 02:44:41.520
<v Speaker 6>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's a.</v>

3913
02:44:41.610 --> 02:44:45.780
<v Speaker 6>But I think like most people exaggerate </v>
<v Speaker 6>about what things.</v>

3914
02:44:46.110 --> 02:44:47.580
<v Speaker 6>As long as it didn't kill you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'd go,</v>

3915
02:44:47.581 --> 02:44:48.620
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Ninety seconds.</v>

3916
02:44:48.650 --> 02:44:49.990
<v Speaker 6>Not that much.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would try just to feel it.</v>

3917
02:44:49.991 --> 02:44:50.430
<v Speaker 6>It feels like.</v>

3918
02:44:51.990 --> 02:44:53.010
<v Speaker 7>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I Dunno.</v>

3919
02:44:53.400 --> 02:44:53.760
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3920
02:44:53.761 --> 02:44:58.761
<v Speaker 7>it'd be funny is then like it would </v>
<v Speaker 7>become like if you see a bald guy who'd </v>

3921
02:44:58.761 --> 02:44:58.761
<v Speaker 7>be considered a pussy</v>

3922
02:44:58.761 --> 02:45:00.740
<v Speaker 6>because he can take 90 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3923
02:45:01.010 --> 02:45:02.660
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's a man who accepts his feet.</v>

3924
02:45:03.600 --> 02:45:04.910
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when he would argue,</v>

3925
02:45:05.240 --> 02:45:06.860
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all those guys with the guy,</v>

3926
02:45:06.861 --> 02:45:09.980
<v Speaker 5>Smiley haircut at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can talk to them in their hair,</v>

3927
02:45:10.250 --> 02:45:11.990
<v Speaker 5>would be given them as shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want you to do it.</v>

3928
02:45:11.991 --> 02:45:16.991
<v Speaker 5>We'll do it right here at the bar with </v>
<v Speaker 5>their Patrick swayze roadhouse here to </v>

3929
02:45:16.991 --> 02:45:16.991
<v Speaker 5>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It'd be,</v>

3930
02:45:16.991 --> 02:45:21.910
<v Speaker 5>it'd be like the accused,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some ballgown would finally get held </v>

3931
02:45:21.910 --> 02:45:24.560
<v Speaker 5>down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They give them the college kid,</v>

3932
02:45:24.561 --> 02:45:29.561
<v Speaker 5>you're next.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm happy to do it to me in the long </v>

3933
02:45:29.561 --> 02:45:31.541
<v Speaker 5>run,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there really shouldn't have done it </v>

3934
02:45:31.541 --> 02:45:31.541
<v Speaker 5>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd like,</v>

3935
02:45:31.541 --> 02:45:31.541
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like having my head shape now,</v>

3936
02:45:31.541 --> 02:45:36.100
<v Speaker 5>but I wouldn't do it now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they just see how you get more </v>

3937
02:45:36.100 --> 02:45:36.100
<v Speaker 5>active work with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3938
02:45:36.100 --> 02:45:39.890
<v Speaker 5>I've actually,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not doing anything about my hair </v>

3939
02:45:39.890 --> 02:45:39.890
<v Speaker 5>falling out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so eventually it's going that route.</v>

3940
02:45:39.890 --> 02:45:41.180
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just figured,</v>

3941
02:45:41.181 --> 02:45:43.940
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I look if I was going to be a sex symbol</v>

3942
02:45:43.950 --> 02:45:46.140
<v Speaker 5>wouldn't happen by now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm so clear.</v>

3943
02:45:46.940 --> 02:45:48.840
<v Speaker 5>So clearly the friend.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How will you know?</v>

3944
02:45:49.970 --> 02:45:52.220
<v Speaker 5>40 four over.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's over.</v>

3945
02:45:54.500 --> 02:45:59.500
<v Speaker 5>There's nothing better than </v>
<v Speaker 5>acknowledging that I'm keeping the rest </v>

3946
02:45:59.500 --> 02:45:59.500
<v Speaker 5>of it looking good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But what,</v>

3947
02:45:59.500 --> 02:46:00.680
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3948
02:46:00.681 --> 02:46:05.681
<v Speaker 5>I didn't acknowledge it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had hair transplants or they take </v>

3949
02:46:05.681 --> 02:46:07.130
<v Speaker 5>little plastic things with hair stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you have those ones,</v>

3950
02:46:08.130 --> 02:46:10.450
<v Speaker 5>they take a slice out of the back of my </v>
<v Speaker 5>head.</v>

3951
02:46:10.470 --> 02:46:11.150
<v Speaker 5>That one?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3952
02:46:11.151 --> 02:46:16.151
<v Speaker 5>You take like a trip and they put it on </v>
<v Speaker 5>the Petri dish where they just vacuum it</v>

3953
02:46:16.561 --> 02:46:17.820
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They take one at a time,</v>

3954
02:46:17.821 --> 02:46:21.430
<v Speaker 5>they drop it in and see the whole.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had a buddy of mine,</v>

3955
02:46:21.630 --> 02:46:23.280
<v Speaker 5>she checks you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you just fucking do it.</v>

3956
02:46:23.281 --> 02:46:27.380
<v Speaker 5>And I sat there and watched the dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is a bloody fucking doesn't mess.</v>

3957
02:46:27.440 --> 02:46:28.740
<v Speaker 5>Not that big a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't,</v>

3958
02:46:28.770 --> 02:46:31.130
<v Speaker 5>doesn't hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I would say never do it for,</v>

3959
02:46:31.200 --> 02:46:32.130
<v Speaker 5>for two reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One,</v>

3960
02:46:32.310 --> 02:46:37.310
<v Speaker 5>because I mean I wanted to shave my head</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I have this big stupid smile on the </v>

3961
02:46:37.310 --> 02:46:37.310
<v Speaker 5>back of my head,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but two,</v>

3962
02:46:37.310 --> 02:46:40.200
<v Speaker 5>because the just shave your fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>head.</v>

3963
02:46:40.520 --> 02:46:42.690
<v Speaker 5>So it's really not that big a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Once you do it,</v>

3964
02:46:42.900 --> 02:46:44.610
<v Speaker 5>he'd go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why would I ever get a haircut again?</v>

3965
02:46:44.611 --> 02:46:49.611
<v Speaker 5>So stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like really getting attached to </v>

3966
02:46:49.611 --> 02:46:49.920
<v Speaker 5>just some shit that grows out of your </v>
<v Speaker 5>head is so weird.</v>

3967
02:46:49.921 --> 02:46:52.350
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the worst one is a fucking toupee.</v>

3968
02:46:53.040 --> 02:46:56.250
<v Speaker 5>Like this hat you just can't take off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like how fucking sweaty.</v>

3969
02:46:57.420 --> 02:46:59.850
<v Speaker 5>Especially if you exercise like you ever</v>
<v Speaker 5>see those hair from him.</v>

3970
02:47:00.090 --> 02:47:03.310
<v Speaker 5>Those guys are fucking playing tennis </v>
<v Speaker 5>and Shit and run and sweat.</v>

3971
02:47:03.311 --> 02:47:06.120
<v Speaker 5>And what is it they just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's like a weave for guys.</v>

3972
02:47:06.121 --> 02:47:07.040
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well you're,</v>

3973
02:47:07.110 --> 02:47:07.290
<v Speaker 5>you're</v>

3974
02:47:07.550 --> 02:47:08.370
<v Speaker 1>sitting here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3975
02:47:08.430 --> 02:47:09.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3976
02:47:09.081 --> 02:47:14.081
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was a young man when I was </v>

3977
02:47:14.081 --> 02:47:14.630
<v Speaker 1>worried that I was going to go bald,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought about all the possibilities.</v>

3978
02:47:14.631 --> 02:47:19.631
<v Speaker 1>I looked into everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to find out what everything </v>

3979
02:47:19.631 --> 02:47:19.631
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the hair club for men,</v>

3980
02:47:19.631 --> 02:47:19.700
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them,</v>

3981
02:47:19.760 --> 02:47:24.760
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like your existing hair goes </v>

3982
02:47:24.760 --> 02:47:27.221
<v Speaker 1>through it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like a thing that they lay on </v>

3983
02:47:27.221 --> 02:47:27.350
<v Speaker 1>top of you and your hair goes through </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

3984
02:47:27.351 --> 02:47:30.850
<v Speaker 1>So it's some of your hair and some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fake hair and then they kind of like</v>

3985
02:47:30.860 --> 02:47:35.860
<v Speaker 1>glue it on its death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a friend who had one for a long </v>

3986
02:47:35.860 --> 02:47:37.180
<v Speaker 1>time and then he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3987
02:47:37.220 --> 02:47:39.470
<v Speaker 1>he abandoned it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So few.</v>

3988
02:47:39.471 --> 02:47:41.030
<v Speaker 1>I actually know quite a few people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have had them,</v>

3989
02:47:41.420 --> 02:47:46.420
<v Speaker 1>but it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a girl's fucking sweaty thing and </v>

3990
02:47:46.420 --> 02:47:49.450
<v Speaker 1>once you just accept it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you get used to the fact that you </v>

3991
02:47:49.450 --> 02:47:49.450
<v Speaker 1>don't have your hair anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

3992
02:47:49.450 --> 02:47:50.780
<v Speaker 1>it's so freeing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like once I shaved my head,</v>

3993
02:47:51.020 --> 02:47:56.020
<v Speaker 1>I got to the point where even though I </v>
<v Speaker 1>had hair transplants is still look like </v>

3994
02:47:56.020 --> 02:47:56.020
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3995
02:47:56.020 --> 02:47:56.020
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

3996
02:47:56.580 --> 02:47:59.160
<v Speaker 2>the stuff in the back never comes out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we put it up here.</v>

3997
02:47:59.510 --> 02:47:59.910
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3998
02:47:59.911 --> 02:48:01.350
<v Speaker 2>the rest of this shit is going to fall </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

3999
02:48:01.500 --> 02:48:03.580
<v Speaker 2>So then what's going to happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also it's like,</v>

4000
02:48:03.600 --> 02:48:07.370
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I'm dropping this shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>behind enemy lines in the safety zone</v>

4001
02:48:07.900 --> 02:48:12.900
<v Speaker 1>the way I described it as like taking a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of people who are really healthy </v>

4002
02:48:12.900 --> 02:48:12.970
<v Speaker 1>and moving them into a neighborhood </v>
<v Speaker 1>where everyone's dying.</v>

4003
02:48:13.200 --> 02:48:13.790
