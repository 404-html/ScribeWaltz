20
00:00:41.821 --> 00:00:45.420
<v Speaker 1>I get tested so I just went fishing </v>
<v Speaker 1>after school instead of partying instead</v>

21
00:00:45.421 --> 00:00:45.860
<v Speaker 1>of partying.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well you getting tested for just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

23
00:00:48.301 --> 00:00:51.270
<v Speaker 1>like your probation officer was show up </v>
<v Speaker 1>at your crib or whatever.</v>

24
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.270
<v Speaker 1>What'd you do to get you a probation </v>
<v Speaker 1>officer?</v>

25
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.040
<v Speaker 1>I had a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had like a,</v>

26
00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.410
<v Speaker 1>I think we talked about this before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had like an assault,</v>

27
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.830
<v Speaker 1>like my second year of college,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I caught an assault charge,</v>

28
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.370
<v Speaker 1>but it was self defense and assault,</v>
<v Speaker 1>self defense,</v>

29
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.050
<v Speaker 1>self defense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I plan out,</v>

30
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:08.370
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

31
00:01:08.371 --> 00:01:11.370
<v Speaker 1>me and my buddy justin forming like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>quote and go party.</v>

32
00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:15.000
<v Speaker 1>But he would come pick me up and we just</v>
<v Speaker 1>go fishing on the lakes and shit.</v>

33
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.040
<v Speaker 1>So Orlando's got really good bass </v>
<v Speaker 1>fishing.</v>

34
00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:18.660
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really does.</v>

35
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.240
<v Speaker 1>I love fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm weighing a bass fishing.</v>

36
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.160
<v Speaker 1>I'll building like large mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

37
00:01:23.161 --> 00:01:25.200
<v Speaker 1>large mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do the rubber worms,</v>

38
00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.580
<v Speaker 1>like the frogs off the lily pads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spinnerbaits all that jazz crank baits,</v>

39
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.540
<v Speaker 1>little Rapala,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little minnows and shit.</v>

40
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.090
<v Speaker 1>Mine was the watermelon seed worms that </v>
<v Speaker 1>bounce off the,</v>

41
00:01:36.091 --> 00:01:38.050
<v Speaker 1>off the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was what you do.</v>

42
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.770
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever get like one of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>boats,</v>

43
00:01:40.771 --> 00:01:41.604
<v Speaker 1>those little bass boats with a flat </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottoms and you can move around with a </v>

44
00:01:44.131 --> 00:01:47.370
<v Speaker 1>little trolling motor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what we did was I had a canoe,</v>

45
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.110
<v Speaker 1>I had a canoeist decrypt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then on the other leg we saw this,</v>

46
00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:52.944
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>onboard voter that the dude had just </v>

47
00:01:54.271 --> 00:01:56.070
<v Speaker 1>left on his dock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one night we were,</v>

48
00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.920
<v Speaker 1>we were younger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like high school where I was,</v>

49
00:01:57.921 --> 00:01:59.910
<v Speaker 1>so we stole this dude's and boat and put</v>
<v Speaker 1>it on my canoe.</v>

50
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.530
<v Speaker 1>So we were cruising with the fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

51
00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.230
<v Speaker 1>the onboard motor on my canoe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did you install it on a canoe?</v>

52
00:02:07.231 --> 00:02:10.050
<v Speaker 1>Because it couldn't do as a pointy end </v>
<v Speaker 1>as opposed to a flat end.</v>

53
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.401
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My boy,</v>

54
00:02:11.401 --> 00:02:12.360
<v Speaker 1>justin figured it out.</v>

55
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.330
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea how he fucking did it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't make any sense.</v>

56
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.970
<v Speaker 1>He rigged it up to put it on the back of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shit,</v>

57
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.953
<v Speaker 1>but cause it couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has two points as a point in the </v>

58
00:02:20.221 --> 00:02:21.580
<v Speaker 1>front and appoint in the back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

59
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:22.543
<v Speaker 1>How,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the hell do you get a motor back </v>

60
00:02:23.221 --> 00:02:24.990
<v Speaker 1>there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did it.</v>

61
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.850
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He called it the,</v>

62
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.290
<v Speaker 1>was it a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

63
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.173
<v Speaker 1>a trolling motor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a real quiet one or was it a big </v>

64
00:02:31.201 --> 00:02:33.450
<v Speaker 1>heavy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it was the quiet little one.</v>

65
00:02:33.451 --> 00:02:34.780
<v Speaker 1>You can put it on the front,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

66
00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.420
<v Speaker 1>That little little thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

67
00:02:36.421 --> 00:02:37.080
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

68
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.621
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

69
00:02:37.621 --> 00:02:40.860
<v Speaker 1>The idea of those is you want to like </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost kind of go against uh,</v>

70
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.540
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

71
00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.770
<v Speaker 1>like of a titus pulling you one way or </v>
<v Speaker 1>the the,</v>

72
00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or move along the bank.</v>

73
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.970
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in freshwater use them.</v>

74
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:49.043
<v Speaker 1>Actually they're probably only using </v>
<v Speaker 1>fresh water cause you could creep into </v>

75
00:02:51.511 --> 00:02:52.344
<v Speaker 1>the lily pads with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we'd creep in and there was like a </v>

76
00:02:54.061 --> 00:02:54.894
<v Speaker 1>drop off on this lake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the Butler chain and like around </v>

77
00:02:57.361 --> 00:02:59.370
<v Speaker 1>sundown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just fish would just be right there.</v>

78
00:02:59.371 --> 00:03:00.970
<v Speaker 1>If you get to the drop off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could hit them.</v>

79
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.220
<v Speaker 1>I love fishing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's fun.</v>

80
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.790
<v Speaker 1>It's something primal about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something primal about like when</v>

81
00:03:06.791 --> 00:03:09.020
<v Speaker 1>you catch something and you see it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when you're like,</v>

82
00:03:09.021 --> 00:03:11.140
<v Speaker 1>how can I want to go on a gallon?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then as it's coming up,</v>

83
00:03:11.141 --> 00:03:12.610
<v Speaker 1>you see it in the water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like who they are.</v>

84
00:03:12.611 --> 00:03:13.444
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

85
00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:14.550
<v Speaker 1>Oh my goodness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

86
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.980
<v Speaker 1>I think it goes back to like ancient DNA</v>
<v Speaker 1>or something.</v>

87
00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

88
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.310
<v Speaker 1>it's also you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can feel the life on the line,</v>

89
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:22.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can feel it.</v>

90
00:03:22.601 --> 00:03:24.110
<v Speaker 1>But I was a catch and released.</v>

91
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.320
<v Speaker 1>I used to eat them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then I started feeling bad because I</v>

92
00:03:26.321 --> 00:03:27.600
<v Speaker 1>was going out every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I just,</v>

93
00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.290
<v Speaker 1>I let them go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you really feel bad,</v>

94
00:03:29.291 --> 00:03:32.740
<v Speaker 1>don't catch and release because when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>catch and release a lot of them die.</v>

95
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.200
<v Speaker 1>That's the dirty secret about catch and </v>
<v Speaker 1>release fishing.</v>

96
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.553
<v Speaker 1>Kind of creepy because like I went </v>
<v Speaker 1>salmon fishing and this is really kind </v>

97
00:03:40.541 --> 00:03:42.460
<v Speaker 1>of brought home to me when I went salmon</v>
<v Speaker 1>fishing,</v>

98
00:03:42.461 --> 00:03:47.290
<v Speaker 1>me and the Rx your fear a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago and went up to Alaska and uh,</v>

99
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.690
<v Speaker 1>when we were like write more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting up there,</v>

100
00:03:49.691 --> 00:03:50.524
<v Speaker 1>they had turned it into catch and </v>
<v Speaker 1>release because they have like a salmon </v>

101
00:03:53.171 --> 00:03:54.520
<v Speaker 1>weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what a weirder is.</v>

102
00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.983
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

103
00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.330
<v Speaker 1>they have these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

104
00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:58.263
<v Speaker 1>sort of a patch pathways that the salmon</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to go through and they set them up </v>

105
00:04:02.951 --> 00:04:03.784
<v Speaker 1>so they can add,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can accurately count how many </v>

106
00:04:05.741 --> 00:04:07.420
<v Speaker 1>salmon go through at any given time.</v>

107
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:12.100
<v Speaker 1>So they can estimate how strong the </v>
<v Speaker 1>schools are that are coming upstream and</v>

108
00:04:12.101 --> 00:04:14.140
<v Speaker 1>downstream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they can ask teammate pretty,</v>

109
00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.960
<v Speaker 1>pretty accurately how many salmon are in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the river,</v>

110
00:04:16.961 --> 00:04:18.850
<v Speaker 1>what the populations are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how healthy they are.</v>

111
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.380
<v Speaker 1>So the salmon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're there,</v>

112
00:04:20.381 --> 00:04:21.340
<v Speaker 1>it goes right there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see it.</v>

113
00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:23.163
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got like right before we're going </v>

114
00:04:25.271 --> 00:04:27.480
<v Speaker 1>up there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got poor numbers and uh,</v>

115
00:04:27.481 --> 00:04:30.490
<v Speaker 1>it was kind of ironic because the day we</v>
<v Speaker 1>got there,</v>

116
00:04:30.491 --> 00:04:31.324
<v Speaker 1>the numbers were off the fucking charts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got there at like one of the best </v>

117
00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.940
<v Speaker 1>days for salmon fishing ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we had to let them all go.</v>

118
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.950
<v Speaker 1>It was real weird.</v>

<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

121
00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:46.780

<v Speaker 1>we couldn't keep any of them.</v>

122
00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:48.580
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we call a rainbow trout.</v>

123
00:04:48.581 --> 00:04:50.500
<v Speaker 1>I got to keep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was pretty rare.</v>

124
00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:51.950
<v Speaker 1>You don't really get to any rainbows up </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

125
00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:53.380
<v Speaker 1>I put the salmon were giant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

126
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.180
<v Speaker 1>we were catching them all day and </v>
<v Speaker 1>releasing them,</v>

127
00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.420
<v Speaker 1>but you release him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

128
00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.120
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the four grand going </v>
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>

129
00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:59.313
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see some fun kills deeper than the </v>

130
00:05:01.781 --> 00:05:03.910
<v Speaker 1>lifting and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I felt,</v>

131
00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.590
<v Speaker 1>I felt I'll write about my out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get them,</v>

132
00:05:05.591 --> 00:05:06.910
<v Speaker 1>get them out of the lip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you're right.</v>

133
00:05:06.911 --> 00:05:09.790
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes if they swallowed the bait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they swallow the bait,</v>

134
00:05:09.791 --> 00:05:11.080
<v Speaker 1>I'd take it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

135
00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:12.610
<v Speaker 1>if it was in the lip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I let it go.</v>

136
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:13.653
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some fishes don't taste that good </v>

137
00:05:14.471 --> 00:05:16.210
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing about large mouth bass.</v>

138
00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.830
<v Speaker 1>Delicious fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

139
00:05:17.831 --> 00:05:22.831
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking cat food bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like as Kamin Salmon's a delicious fish,</v>

140
00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.360
<v Speaker 1>but a large mouth bass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

141
00:05:25.361 --> 00:05:26.740
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I could eat this.</v>

142
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.030
<v Speaker 1>Your salt water fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

143
00:05:28.031 --> 00:05:29.620
<v Speaker 1>I'll keep them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they're the right size,</v>

144
00:05:29.621 --> 00:05:30.454
<v Speaker 1>I'll keep them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could freeze them whatever they </v>

145
00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.980
<v Speaker 1>delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But freshwater fish man.</v>

146
00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:34.173
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except for trout there trout tastes </v>

147
00:05:36.131 --> 00:05:36.964
<v Speaker 1>really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

148
00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:38.650
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that brackish water?</v>

149
00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:39.671
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

150
00:05:39.671 --> 00:05:41.550
<v Speaker 1>most trout are fresh water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

151
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.393
<v Speaker 1>there are some brackish water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like steelheads I think you'd go into </v>

152
00:05:44.621 --> 00:05:46.120
<v Speaker 1>the ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

153
00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:47.043
<v Speaker 1>isn't that correct?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think steelheads make it into the </v>

154
00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:49.264
<v Speaker 1>ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

155
00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.170
<v Speaker 1>or they get at least close to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Definitely get into brackish water.</v>

156
00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:53.620
<v Speaker 1>Salmon of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go back and forth.</v>

157
00:05:53.621 --> 00:05:54.790
<v Speaker 1>He's still fish out here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

158
00:05:54.791 --> 00:05:56.140
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love fishing.</v>

159
00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.920
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different places.</v>

160
00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:58.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

161
00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:59.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's uh,</v>

162
00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:01.760
<v Speaker 2>for freshwater there's Lake castaic </v>
<v Speaker 2>which is nice.</v>

163
00:06:01.761 --> 00:06:03.260
<v Speaker 2>They have a lot of actual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

164
00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:05.750
<v Speaker 2>they actually striped bass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are great.</v>

165
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:06.920
<v Speaker 2>It's all fresh water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

166
00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:08.630
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of an artificial lake.</v>

167
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:09.793
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but right now they're hurting because </v>

168
00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:13.250
<v Speaker 2>this drought that we've had up here for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the last few years,</v>

169
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:17.180
<v Speaker 2>like it used to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we used to film fear factor up there and</v>

170
00:06:17.181 --> 00:06:18.830
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially there's this plate called to,</v>

171
00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.600
<v Speaker 2>to hone ranch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the most shocking.</v>

172
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:21.763
<v Speaker 2>There's this place called the home ranch</v>
<v Speaker 2>that had this beautiful lake for large </v>

173
00:06:24.351 --> 00:06:25.184
<v Speaker 2>mouth bass and we used to drop people on</v>
<v Speaker 2>fear factor at a helicopters in this </v>

174
00:06:28.281 --> 00:06:32.000
<v Speaker 2>lake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the lake is completely dry.</v>

175
00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.700
<v Speaker 2>There is nothing in the lake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's dead,</v>

176
00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:37.970
<v Speaker 2>totally dry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely flat.</v>

177
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.270
<v Speaker 2>You could see the bottom of it and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a mass fish die off.</v>

178
00:06:41.271 --> 00:06:42.104
<v Speaker 2>And they said there was some beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>huge 10 plus pound bass that just died </v>

179
00:06:45.801 --> 00:06:48.170
<v Speaker 2>in that lake of no air,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no water,</v>

180
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.580
<v Speaker 2>no nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

181
00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:53.000
<v Speaker 2>So you to see it in the lake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just dead fish everywhere is not,</v>

182
00:06:53.001 --> 00:06:55.880
<v Speaker 2>well now you can't cause all the birds </v>
<v Speaker 2>picked him off and it's all gone because</v>

183

<v Speaker 2>it's been like that for over a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it just completely dried up.</v>

184
00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:02.340
<v Speaker 1>No water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When a lake dries up,</v>

185
00:07:02.341 --> 00:07:04.440
<v Speaker 1>it's just Thanksgiving for birds.</v>

<v Speaker 1>they watch you two videos and they enjoy</v>
<v Speaker 1>it or they don't enjoy it.</v>

236
00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.880
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They walk away,</v>

237
00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 1>they</v>

238
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:59.040
<v Speaker 3>move on with their life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're a rare dude in that case.</v>

239
00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:00.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think for the most part,</v>

240
00:09:00.511 --> 00:09:01.344
<v Speaker 3>80% of the feedback's terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but every once in a while a lot of our </v>

241
00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:07.020
<v Speaker 3>lower thirds on the show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the nicknames we use and Shit,</v>

242
00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:07.883
<v Speaker 3>it's like fans in the youtube comments </v>
<v Speaker 3>leave them and this is all the vice </v>

243
00:09:10.231 --> 00:09:12.000
<v Speaker 3>stuff on the vice stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>On longs world.</v>

244
00:09:12.001 --> 00:09:12.591
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

245
00:09:12.591 --> 00:09:13.424
<v Speaker 3>So they give me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they give me good suggestions and I'll </v>

246
00:09:14.761 --> 00:09:18.240
<v Speaker 3>keep in touch with some of the people I </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk to on Youtube or instagram.</v>

247
00:09:18.241 --> 00:09:19.980
<v Speaker 3>Commoners are pretty fucking good now </v>
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

248
00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:20.873
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>except when they have their accounts </v>

249
00:09:21.991 --> 00:09:22.824
<v Speaker 3>blocked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems to me that like if you look at </v>

250
00:09:25.141 --> 00:09:25.974
<v Speaker 3>90% of the comments on instagram when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you go to their accounts that blocked </v>

251
00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:31.100
<v Speaker 3>the cowards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

252
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.170
<v Speaker 3>Instagram is the land of the cowards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause you can't do that shit.</v>

253
00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:35.213
<v Speaker 3>Like you can't comment on someone else's</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff in most forms unless they can go </v>

254
00:09:38.461 --> 00:09:40.830
<v Speaker 3>to your stuff and look at you put an </v>
<v Speaker 3>Instagram,</v>

255
00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:41.713
<v Speaker 3>they allow you that option.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that they should take it </v>

256
00:09:43.531 --> 00:09:44.670
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They should take it away.</v>

257
00:09:44.671 --> 00:09:46.770
<v Speaker 3>It should be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should own up to the things you were</v>

258
00:09:46.771 --> 00:09:48.300
<v Speaker 3>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well here's my feeling.</v>

259
00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:50.070
<v Speaker 3>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to be private,</v>

260
00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:51.083
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't be allowed to comment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you're going to be private on </v>

261
00:09:53.551 --> 00:09:54.384
<v Speaker 3>Instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't be allowed to just go on </v>

262
00:09:55.231 --> 00:09:56.970
<v Speaker 3>other people's pages and shit all over </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

263
00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:57.571
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause I've,</v>

264
00:09:57.571 --> 00:09:58.404
<v Speaker 3>I've read Sangria but just mean nasty </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking shit that people write on these </v>

265
00:10:01.981 --> 00:10:03.970
<v Speaker 3>girls pages about what the girls look </v>
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>

266
00:10:03.971 --> 00:10:05.550
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like well what does this mother </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucker look like?</v>

267
00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:06.593

<v Speaker 3>cause all I could see of your face is </v>

268
00:10:07.561 --> 00:10:10.260
<v Speaker 3>this like one eighth of a centimeter </v>
<v Speaker 3>face.</v>

269
00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:13.050
<v Speaker 3>And so then I go to their page and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>blocked.</v>

270
00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:15.780
<v Speaker 3>I'll see on homegirls like pages and </v>

275
00:10:23.701 --> 00:10:25.500
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm saying.</v>

277
00:10:27.151 --> 00:10:27.984
<v Speaker 3>grandma had a nice dump look over there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially if we're worried that the </v>

278
00:10:30.301 --> 00:10:31.134
<v Speaker 3>grandma might actually look at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>picture with her granddaughter and </v>

279
00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:35.250
<v Speaker 3>Village Fair out there trying to come </v>
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

280
00:10:35.251 --> 00:10:40.020

<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

282
00:10:41.981 --> 00:10:44.610
<v Speaker 3>They see facebook is the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>transparent.</v>

283
00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:45.533
<v Speaker 3>You can go right to someone's page and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you see exactly who they are and that's </v>

284
00:10:48.001 --> 00:10:48.834
<v Speaker 3>a different animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know the the instagrams weird in </v>

285
00:10:51.601 --> 00:10:52.434
<v Speaker 3>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like some people don't even have a </v>

286
00:10:53.311 --> 00:10:54.300
<v Speaker 3>photo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

287
00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:56.550
<v Speaker 3>you'd go to their instagram pages,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no photo.</v>

288
00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all blocked up.</v>

289
00:10:58.621 --> 00:11:01.650
<v Speaker 3>But then they just use it to comment on </v>
<v Speaker 3>people's pages and shit on them.</v>

290
00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.810
<v Speaker 3>Youtube and instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I said,</v>

291
00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:06.270
<v Speaker 3>80% of it's terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's always entertaining.</v>

292
00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:10.020
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking super fucking entertaining.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it's not an entertaining to me</v>

293
00:11:10.021 --> 00:11:12.630
<v Speaker 3>because I feel like there's so much </v>
<v Speaker 3>spinning your wheels.</v>

294
00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:13.613
<v Speaker 3>I like these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these people that are like super mega </v>

295
00:11:15.361 --> 00:11:18.180
<v Speaker 3>negative on these things like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not getting it.</v>

296
00:11:18.181 --> 00:11:21.300
<v Speaker 3>No one's getting anywhere with this </v>
<v Speaker 3>people with lives,</v>

297
00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:22.463

<v Speaker 1>I got drunk and I ended up eating like a</v>

350
00:13:34.931 --> 00:13:37.600
<v Speaker 1>bag of chips and SMURF gummies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

351
00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:40.180
<v Speaker 1>so that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not the ketosis.</v>

352
00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:44.050
<v Speaker 1>Alcohol too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alcohol translates directly and sugar in</v>

353
00:13:44.051 --> 00:13:44.884
<v Speaker 1>your body or transforms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'd just like to tell myself that </v>

354
00:13:47.501 --> 00:13:48.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You're just trying to be healthier.</v>

<v Speaker 1>If I could get to like 32 A.</v>

361
00:14:03.521 --> 00:14:04.354
<v Speaker 1>I think it helped my basketball game </v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I got the dream killers now bro </v>

362

<v Speaker 1>Development League you see?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like anybody can,</v>

364
00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:19.720
<v Speaker 1>anybody could see you could try out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not going to work.</v>

365
00:14:19.721 --> 00:14:24.500
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My dream is I think you got a little run</v>

366
00:14:24.501 --> 00:14:29.260
<v Speaker 1>our test and use some better way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go down a cup size of trial</v>

367
00:14:29.261 --> 00:14:30.580
<v Speaker 1>for the oh man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

368
00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:31.700
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do this.</v>

369
00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:32.563
<v Speaker 1>Do you play a lot of basketball?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I played a lot of basketball and </v>

370
00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:35.950
<v Speaker 1>watching the knicks this year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

371
00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:37.540
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I could do some things for </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

372
00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:42.560
<v Speaker 1>Addiction is so fucking terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

373
00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:47.680
<v Speaker 1>I could watch it and be terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they're in New York they have money.</v>

374
00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:49.270
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a giant ass team.</v>

375
00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:50.293
<v Speaker 1>Cause,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a lot of bad things you </v>

376
00:14:51.051 --> 00:14:53.600
<v Speaker 1>can buy with money like Carmelo Anthony.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh see bad,</v>

377
00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:55.150
<v Speaker 1>terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes me,</v>

378
00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.650
<v Speaker 1>he had a good year this year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just like he,</v>

379
00:14:57.651 --> 00:14:58.484
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

380
00:14:58.550 --> 00:14:59.490
<v Speaker 1>he's not terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

381
00:14:59.491 --> 00:15:03.080
<v Speaker 1>he's a bad fit for this team because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>needs to be on a winner.</v>

382
00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:05.780
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he reassigned with the knicks knowing it</v>

383
00:15:05.781 --> 00:15:09.320
<v Speaker 1>was rebuilding team and he should be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he should have gone to Chicago.</v>

384
00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:10.513
<v Speaker 1>I want us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she'd gone to Chicago or we should have </v>

385
00:15:12.471 --> 00:15:13.304
<v Speaker 1>traded Carmelo for Blake Griffin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would have helped the clippers and </v>

386
00:15:15.031 --> 00:15:15.864
<v Speaker 1>it would have helped the next,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a lot of technical talk and I'm </v>

387
00:15:17.331 --> 00:15:19.640
<v Speaker 1>not really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not really hip to all right.</v>

388
00:15:19.641 --> 00:15:22.940
<v Speaker 1>We'll move on to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're just trying to be healthier is</v>

389
00:15:22.941 --> 00:15:24.340
<v Speaker 1>where you're trying to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

390

391
00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:29.240
<v Speaker 1>I still play ball.</v>

392
00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:31.340

<v Speaker 1>It's like Pasadena or drive an hour </v>

<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

399
00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:45.620
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

400
00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:49.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause I all 30 like last year I was 30 I</v>

401
00:15:49.341 --> 00:15:52.820
<v Speaker 1>just turned 34 like last month and last </v>
<v Speaker 1>year was the first year I was like,</v>

402
00:15:52.821 --> 00:15:55.610
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually got a lot worse at basketball</v>

403
00:15:55.611 --> 00:15:59.480
<v Speaker 1>because I was getting incrementally </v>
<v Speaker 1>better and I was like,</v>

404
00:15:59.481 --> 00:16:01.130
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm getting old.</v>

405
00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:04.100
<v Speaker 1>This was the first year I felt old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you it's just because you're</v>

406
00:16:04.101 --> 00:16:04.934
<v Speaker 1>busy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>34 it's not old enough where your body </v>

407
00:16:06.171 --> 00:16:09.290
<v Speaker 1>starts deteriorating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you lift weights?</v>

408
00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:10.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do weights.</v>

409
00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:12.030
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I apply on metrics.</v>

410
00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:13.023
<v Speaker 1>Isometrics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of doc can fuck with your w </v>

411
00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.360
<v Speaker 1>a basketball game bat in a bad way.</v>

412
00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:20.660
<v Speaker 1>I used to fuck with my pool game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a big problem that I like to lift</v>

413
00:16:20.661 --> 00:16:21.494
<v Speaker 1>weights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I also like to play pool and when </v>

414
00:16:22.881 --> 00:16:23.714
<v Speaker 1>you lift a lot of weights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get sore and when you're sore and </v>

415
00:16:25.881 --> 00:16:27.740
<v Speaker 1>stiff it fucks with your fine motor </v>
<v Speaker 1>skills.</v>

416
00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:29.980
<v Speaker 1>It would really fuck with my pool game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

417
00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:31.550
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my jumpers trash right now.</v>

418
00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:32.473
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of that has to do with </v>

419
00:16:33.111 --> 00:16:33.944
<v Speaker 1>lifting weights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could work for a lot of people when </v>

420
00:16:35.331 --> 00:16:36.164
<v Speaker 1>you're sore and you're like why all the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know how like I guess I don't play </v>

421
00:16:39.291 --> 00:16:40.640
<v Speaker 1>basketball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm and I'm terrible at it.</v>

422
00:16:40.641 --> 00:16:45.200
<v Speaker 1>But I would imagine that it's similar to</v>
<v Speaker 1>pool in that you got to know exactly how</v>

423
00:16:45.201 --> 00:16:47.360
<v Speaker 1>much effort to put on that ball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

424
00:16:47.361 --> 00:16:48.560
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

425
00:16:48.561 --> 00:16:51.800
<v Speaker 1>I know like when a crumple up the paper </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I throw it in a Trashcan,</v>

426
00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:52.820
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird thing.</v>

427
00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:55.190
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause you kind of estimating the drop,</v>

428
00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:59.750
<v Speaker 1>you know the arc of that little thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to have this fine sense.</v>

429
00:16:59.751 --> 00:17:02.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm a send this video to everyone on my </v>
<v Speaker 1>squad and be like,</v>

430
00:17:02.271 --> 00:17:04.340
<v Speaker 1>guys you got to give me the Baltimore </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot.</v>

431
00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:06.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm just missing shots cause I'm too </v>
<v Speaker 1>strong now.</v>

432
00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:11.540
<v Speaker 1>Lived in too many ways to switch over is</v>
<v Speaker 1>not wet too swollen to school.</v>

433
00:17:11.541 --> 00:17:15.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm way too small for this game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does fine.</v>

434
00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:15.853
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a like sort of a point of </v>

435
00:17:18.471 --> 00:17:19.304
<v Speaker 1>diminishing returns when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>lifting weights and then doing fine </v>

436
00:17:22.101 --> 00:17:23.350
<v Speaker 1>motor skill activities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

437
00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:24.343
<v Speaker 1>he used to fuck with me drawing too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I lift a lot of ways my hands would </v>

438
00:17:27.171 --> 00:17:28.004
<v Speaker 1>get tired from like gripping and </v>
<v Speaker 1>squeezing things and then when I would </v>

439
00:17:31.401 --> 00:17:35.690
<v Speaker 1>draw like my fine motor skills with my </v>
<v Speaker 1>hands would be off.</v>

440
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:36.770
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>

441
00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:38.570
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It affects it a lot.</v>

442
00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:41.720
<v Speaker 1>Our team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had this team called the molly boys,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened to her man?</v>

468
00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:47.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

469
00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.233

470
00:18:51.451 --> 00:18:52.460
<v Speaker 1>recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not,</v>

471
00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:53.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

472
00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:56.840
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird world.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Haven't put her face on like oppress </v>

<v Speaker 1>That would,</v>

477
00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:07.613
<v Speaker 1>that would sell like wildfire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody out there and making pressed </v>

<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

480
00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:17.130
<v Speaker 1>You would think that would be the one </v>
<v Speaker 1>people forgot about her.</v>

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:21.510
<v Speaker 1>People forgot about mt got about home.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

488
00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:37.070
<v Speaker 1>Swole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He might be too for the chairs.</v>

489
00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:38.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm hanging up on the wall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

490
00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:39.481
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll wear it.</v>

491
00:19:39.481 --> 00:19:43.480
<v Speaker 1>I'll stretch it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make it a Jamaica tank top.</v>

492
00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:44.840
<v Speaker 1>Make it something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My only word.</v>

493
00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:45.683
<v Speaker 1>That gym.</v>

494
00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:51.990
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're doing that three times a week.</v>

495
00:19:51.991 --> 00:19:53.670
<v Speaker 1>You're playing basketball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's dedication.</v>

496
00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:56.220
<v Speaker 1>I would think to that alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that activity.</v>

497
00:19:56.221 --> 00:19:57.930
<v Speaker 1>That would be a great way to lose </v>
<v Speaker 1>weight.</v>

498
00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:59.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My fitbit says I'm doing work.</v>

499
00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:01.980
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fitbit in the scale.</v>

500
00:20:01.981 --> 00:20:04.470
<v Speaker 1>Disagree though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the food?</v>

501
00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:06.050
<v Speaker 1>Definitely the food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's food.</v>

502
00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:09.810
<v Speaker 1>My job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you make delicious shit.</v>

503
00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:14.250
<v Speaker 1>How hard is it when you make delicious </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit to eat non delicious shit.</v>

504
00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:15.263
<v Speaker 1>That's a problem because it's almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>like as like imagine for a guy like me </v>

505
00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:21.120
<v Speaker 1>as a comic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if I was a comic,</v>

506
00:20:21.121 --> 00:20:23.520
<v Speaker 1>but the only way to be healthy it was to</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to shitty jokes.</v>

507
00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:25.840
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guts.</v>

508
00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:30.750
<v Speaker 1>Kind of like what's going on because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>describe yourself as sandwich artist.</v>

509
00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:35.390
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately what you are is uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an Ileus subway employee</v>

510
00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:36.323
<v Speaker 4>full time.</v>

511
00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:41.170
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there's a lot of jared jokes.</v>

512
00:20:41.171 --> 00:20:41.900
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to,</v>

513
00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:44.140
<v Speaker 1>we're going to keep moving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you,</v>

514
00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:47.470
<v Speaker 1>you're making delicious art,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

515
00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:48.100
<v Speaker 1>and then</v>

516
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:51.100
<v Speaker 3>you're eating styrofoam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

517
00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:54.400
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My problem also is I make fire,</v>

518
00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:57.430
<v Speaker 3>I eat it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then later on at night,</v>

519
00:20:57.460 --> 00:20:59.230
<v Speaker 3>even if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I'm not making,</v>

520
00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:02.320
<v Speaker 3>I will eat anything you put anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>

521
00:21:02.321 --> 00:21:04.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're a late night dude.</v>

522
00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:05.523
<v Speaker 3>Late night is where I really do the </v>
<v Speaker 3>damage and then the booze to the booze </v>

523
00:21:08.861 --> 00:21:11.350
<v Speaker 3>is a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I've been drinking less,</v>

524
00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:13.660
<v Speaker 3>drinking less,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just smoking weed,</v>

525
00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:16.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm going to get there.</v>

526
00:21:16.121 --> 00:21:18.610
<v Speaker 3>What next time I come in here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mill shredded boost,</v>

527
00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:19.940
<v Speaker 3>Hattie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

528
00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:22.330
<v Speaker 3>oh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where's the beach?</v>

529
00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:28.630
<v Speaker 3>So if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you just cut out carbs,</v>

530
00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:29.703
<v Speaker 3>you can still eat delicious shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's the beautiful thing about </v>

531
00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:34.690
<v Speaker 3>like trying to get into a ketogenic </v>
<v Speaker 3>diet.</v>

532
00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:36.820
<v Speaker 3>There's like delicious steaks you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>eat,</v>

533
00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:40.480
<v Speaker 3>you can eat some sweet potatoes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can eat like slinky sweet potatoes.</v>

534
00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:42.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just fiber,</v>

535
00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:44.380
<v Speaker 3>but just don't eat too much.</v>

536
00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:45.233
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole idea is to take in as little </v>

537
00:21:46.601 --> 00:21:50.380
<v Speaker 3>sugar as possible and have your body </v>
<v Speaker 3>start operating off of fats.</v>

538
00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:53.620
<v Speaker 3>And what else is a good fiber to eat </v>
<v Speaker 3>besides sweet potato?</v>

539
00:21:53.621 --> 00:21:55.900
<v Speaker 3>Like what do you do for your cravings?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what's killing me.</v>

540
00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:58.270
<v Speaker 3>Discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I do.</v>

541
00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:00.230
<v Speaker 3>Fuck this stuff is uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

542
00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:03.220
<v Speaker 3>this stuff is called [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a,</v>

543
00:22:03.221 --> 00:22:07.750
<v Speaker 3>these are x xed exogenous ketones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are all minerals in a minute.</v>

544
00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:08.643
<v Speaker 3>Amino acids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I add these to water and what they </v>

545
00:22:10.571 --> 00:22:13.480
<v Speaker 3>do is they put your body in a state of </v>
<v Speaker 3>ketosis pretty rapidly.</v>

546
00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:16.390
<v Speaker 3>They've wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this can put you in Ketosis by itself.</v>

547
00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:19.780
<v Speaker 3>So somebody was telling me this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

548
00:22:19.781 --> 00:22:21.490
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't eat carbs,</v>

549
00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:25.660
<v Speaker 3>that your body creates key totes and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then it starts to eat your fat.</v>

550
00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:26.773
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can I just fucking do a line of fucking </v>

551
00:22:28.571 --> 00:22:29.350
<v Speaker 3>Ketos though?</v>

552
00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:30.183
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why can't you just put these fuckers in </v>

553
00:22:30.971 --> 00:22:32.980
<v Speaker 3>your body and it starts attacking your </v>
<v Speaker 3>fat?</v>

554
00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:34.750
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what this does.</v>

555
00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:37.280
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what that does is keep,</v>

556
00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:42.100
<v Speaker 3>those are exogenous ketones and ketones </v>
<v Speaker 3>is what your body burns off and it's not</v>

557
00:22:42.101 --> 00:22:42.934
<v Speaker 3>burning off carbohydrates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a couple of benefits to it and </v>

558
00:22:44.801 --> 00:22:48.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a scientist and I'm not that </v>
<v Speaker 3>smart so I'm going to butcher this,</v>

559
00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:53.170
<v Speaker 3>but essentially one of the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 3>benefits is that when you,</v>

560
00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:54.790
<v Speaker 3>when your body's eating carbs all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

561
00:22:54.791 --> 00:22:55.624
<v Speaker 3>your body feeds off carbs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For me at least what I would do is I'd </v>

562
00:22:58.181 --> 00:22:59.014
<v Speaker 3>have these big peaks and then these </v>
<v Speaker 3>crashes like I would eat and then after </v>

563
00:23:02.831 --> 00:23:07.831
<v Speaker 3>I ate I was like a bear that got shot </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a tranquilizer dart or and seals,</v>

564
00:23:09.701 --> 00:23:12.850
<v Speaker 3>bears or collar and Debbie May.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

565
00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:17.870
<v Speaker 3>it would crash hard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man hard and then also after I ate about</v>

566
00:23:17.951 --> 00:23:18.784
<v Speaker 3>five hours later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be fucking starving where my body </v>

567
00:23:21.611 --> 00:23:24.220
<v Speaker 3>had processed all the food and then I'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>hit this place like,</v>

568
00:23:24.221 --> 00:23:25.420
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to eat.</v>

569
00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:26.613
<v Speaker 3>I don't get there anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't get to there to that I got to </v>

570
00:23:29.531 --> 00:23:33.940
<v Speaker 3>eat thing like I can go 10 12,</v>
<v Speaker 3>14 hours without eating and I'm fine.</v>

571
00:23:33.941 --> 00:23:34.774
<v Speaker 3>I might be a little hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I feel good like I've worked out </v>

572
00:23:37.301 --> 00:23:39.760
<v Speaker 3>after 16 hours of not eating and be </v>
<v Speaker 3>fine.</v>

573
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:40.833
<v Speaker 3>Like what I'll do is I'll go to bed </v>
<v Speaker 3>early at an early at nine and I'll work </v>

574
00:23:43.961 --> 00:23:44.794
<v Speaker 3>out at noon with nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eat nothing in between that time and </v>

575
00:23:47.631 --> 00:23:48.464
<v Speaker 3>work out at noon and be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what we sound like the girls I knew </v>

576
00:23:50.211 --> 00:23:51.044
<v Speaker 3>in high school though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could go 16 hours without eating </v>

577
00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:56.850
<v Speaker 3>frozen yogurt up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yo,</v>

578
00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:59.780
<v Speaker 3>this is also time Al Bundys favorite </v>
<v Speaker 3>flavor,</v>

579
00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:02.660
<v Speaker 3>natural orange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember when he made,</v>

580
00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:05.720
<v Speaker 3>if you eat an orange to taste anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>like this dog shit,</v>

581
00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:07.910
<v Speaker 3>throw the fucking thing in the garbage </v>
<v Speaker 3>immediately.</v>

582
00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:10.070
<v Speaker 3>The purpose of cogenic still.</v>

583
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:14.120
<v Speaker 3>If I did the Bundy and I made like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>Tang sandwich with the cogenic span.</v>

584
00:24:14.121 --> 00:24:14.960
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

585
00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:16.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to do,</v>

586
00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:19.340
<v Speaker 3>but I do love this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I put the stuff in,</v>

587
00:24:19.341 --> 00:24:21.560
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in water and I mix it up,</v>

588
00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:25.040
<v Speaker 3>drink it all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>showing this gets a little sloppy.</v>

589
00:24:25.041 --> 00:24:28.130
<v Speaker 3>This envelopes a little sloppy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to come up with a good,</v>

590
00:24:28.131 --> 00:24:29.570
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of a,</v>

591
00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:32.150
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a funnel to get it in there.</v>

592
00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:34.460
<v Speaker 3>But what I do is I just kind of shake it</v>
<v Speaker 3>in slow.</v>

593
00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:35.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're smart man.</v>

594
00:24:35.811 --> 00:24:36.644
<v Speaker 3>You're doing a little one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I do is I make a little hole and I </v>

595
00:24:39.471 --> 00:24:42.230
<v Speaker 3>just put that little hole over the water</v>
<v Speaker 3>bottle.</v>

596
00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:46.560
<v Speaker 3>You probably should use an actual glass </v>
<v Speaker 3>of water and said,</v>

597
00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:47.300
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

598
00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:49.460
<v Speaker 3>this isn't enough water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

599
00:24:49.461 --> 00:24:50.780
<v Speaker 3>it's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's good.</v>

600
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:52.310
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just going to be real </v>
<v Speaker 3>strong.</v>

601
00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:53.473
<v Speaker 3>But I'm just saying if you had a glass </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you could mix that bitch up solid </v>

602
00:24:56.211 --> 00:24:57.800
<v Speaker 3>like this Joe Rogan glass here.</v>

603
00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:02.990
<v Speaker 3>Plus I liked the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You drinking in my face.</v>

604
00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:06.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Drinking a Mug of my face.</v>

605
00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:08.533
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

606
00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:09.950
<v Speaker 3>how long have you been trying to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>this?</v>

607
00:25:09.951 --> 00:25:12.110
<v Speaker 3>Be Healthy and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>30,</v>

608
00:25:12.111 --> 00:25:16.310
<v Speaker 3>40 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It hasn't really worked.</v>

609
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:17.833
<v Speaker 3>You just got to write down that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't allow yourself to drink at night </v>

610
00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:23.090
<v Speaker 3>or allow yourself to eat shitty food at </v>
<v Speaker 3>night.</v>

611
00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:24.440
<v Speaker 3>If you could just do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

612
00:25:24.441 --> 00:25:26.690
<v Speaker 3>I started keeping it out of the crib.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the good thing is,</v>

613
00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:30.560
<v Speaker 3>you know how La really helps fat people </v>
<v Speaker 3>is there's no bodegas.</v>

614
00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:33.410
<v Speaker 3>See in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like you could just walk downstairs</v>

615
00:25:33.411 --> 00:25:35.390
<v Speaker 3>and be fat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eat anything you want.</v>

616
00:25:35.391 --> 00:25:36.224
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I missed the day cause that was the </v>

617
00:25:37.131 --> 00:25:39.120
<v Speaker 3>big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in la there are,</v>

618

649
00:26:58.621 --> 00:27:00.400
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's like some funky name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

650
00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:02.100
<v Speaker 1>I've been going to Thai town to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>spot.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They're good though.</v>

653
00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:08.970
<v Speaker 1>With Thai coffee is hilarious because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean just why don't you just shoot sugar</v>

654
00:27:08.971 --> 00:27:09.804
<v Speaker 1>into my veins with a needle?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know like Thai iced tea and Thai </v>

655
00:27:13.441 --> 00:27:15.540
<v Speaker 1>iced coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That stuff is insane.</v>

656
00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.640
<v Speaker 1>They put sugar and condensed milk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

657
00:27:17.641 --> 00:27:19.020
<v Speaker 1>like one wasn't enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

658
00:27:19.021 --> 00:27:21.150
<v Speaker 1>It's double sugared up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so yummy.</v>

659
00:27:21.151 --> 00:27:21.984
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When someone does the organic tie spot </v>

660
00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:24.563
<v Speaker 1>or or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be sugar condensed milk </v>

661
00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:28.020
<v Speaker 1>and the Gavi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what they're going to do.</v>

662
00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:30.090
<v Speaker 1>A Golf I supposed to be super bad for </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

663
00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:31.343
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well everybody thinks that a Gaba is </v>

664
00:27:32.881 --> 00:27:34.740
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all natural man.</v>

665
00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:37.160
<v Speaker 1>It's a Gaba.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gaba is really good.</v>

666
00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:39.300
<v Speaker 1>A Gavi is apparently converted into your</v>
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>

667
00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:42.090
<v Speaker 1>Just like sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like just like cane sugar.</v>

668
00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:45.613
<v Speaker 1>If you don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never thought it could be too great </v>

669
00:27:48.271 --> 00:27:49.500
<v Speaker 1>for you too though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's like,</v>

670
00:27:49.501 --> 00:27:52.080
<v Speaker 1>it looks like it's made from the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing they make Tequila from.</v>

671
00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:54.500
<v Speaker 1>So I'm like right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kill bad for you.</v>

672
00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:58.920
<v Speaker 1>It could be good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be depends on who you're with.</v>

673
00:27:58.970 --> 00:28:00.990
<v Speaker 1>A long term bet short term.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Incredible.</v>

674
00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:05.730
<v Speaker 1>It's a trade off again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends on the company you keep,</v>

675
00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:09.630
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this stuff exotic,</v>

<v Speaker 1>just ketones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the way to go.</v>

677

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.010
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a isometrics,</v>

697
00:28:56.011 --> 00:28:56.844
<v Speaker 1>plyometrics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then sometimes I'll do weights and </v>

698
00:28:58.411 --> 00:29:00.690
<v Speaker 1>then I play ball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's kind of like the four things I</v>

699
00:29:00.691 --> 00:29:02.400
<v Speaker 1>do you ever fuck with kettle bells?</v>

700
00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:03.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

701
00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:06.270
<v Speaker 1>Kettle bells are good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do the Kettlebell swings and shit like</v>

702
00:29:06.271 --> 00:29:07.590
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then step ups,</v>

703
00:29:07.591 --> 00:29:08.850
<v Speaker 1>we kettlebells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

704
00:29:08.970 --> 00:29:10.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like kettle bells.</v>

705
00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:13.590
<v Speaker 1>I feel like you got to get to a level of</v>
<v Speaker 1>buffing this for kettle bells,</v>

706
00:29:13.591 --> 00:29:15.630
<v Speaker 1>but I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you can start with light ones.</v>

707
00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:16.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

708
00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:17.483
<v Speaker 1>The right way to do this is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting podcasts that I've been </v>

709
00:29:20.131 --> 00:29:21.810
<v Speaker 1>listening to with this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pavel,</v>

710
00:29:21.811 --> 00:29:23.250
<v Speaker 1>tat saline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

711
00:29:23.251 --> 00:29:24.084
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sir,</v>

712
00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:27.520
<v Speaker 1>the guy brought kettle bells to America </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's on a Tim Ferriss,</v>

713
00:29:27.521 --> 00:29:32.200
<v Speaker 1>his podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to say number 55 or one 55 yeah,</v>

714
00:29:32.201 --> 00:29:34.670
<v Speaker 1>I just found it last night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you'd told me about this back in this</v>

715
00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:37.770
<v Speaker 1>catalog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but trout around the 50 50 or 55 right?</v>

716
00:29:37.771 --> 00:29:38.604
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

717
00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:42.250
<v Speaker 1>He's to two podcasts in a row and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>talks</v>

718
00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:46.210
<v Speaker 3>about like the correct way to do kettle </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the correct way to strength train,</v>

719
00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:47.463
<v Speaker 3>and one of the things that he's saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>is you should never do more than five </v>

720
00:29:50.201 --> 00:29:51.034
<v Speaker 3>repetitions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should like say if you can lift </v>

721
00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:54.790
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have a 100 pounds,</v>

722
00:29:54.791 --> 00:29:56.620
<v Speaker 3>you can lift a hundred pounds nine </v>
<v Speaker 3>times.</v>

723
00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:57.543
<v Speaker 3>You shouldn't do it nine times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She should do it five due at five and </v>

724
00:29:59.521 --> 00:30:00.670
<v Speaker 3>then put it down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't,</v>

725
00:30:00.671 --> 00:30:01.504
<v Speaker 3>don't go to failure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the idea is the body's not designed </v>

726
00:30:03.521 --> 00:30:04.354
<v Speaker 3>to go to failure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea is that going to failure all </v>

727
00:30:05.741 --> 00:30:06.880
<v Speaker 3>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think like,</v>

728
00:30:06.881 --> 00:30:09.250
<v Speaker 3>we have this idea in our head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm guilty of it more than anybody,</v>

729
00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:11.020
<v Speaker 3>is that more is better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

730
00:30:11.021 --> 00:30:11.854
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to fucking work harder than </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody else and that's just going to </v>

731
00:30:13.871 --> 00:30:14.291
<v Speaker 3>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

732
00:30:14.291 --> 00:30:15.124
<v Speaker 3>that's not really the right way to do it</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it comes to the human body because </v>

733
00:30:17.591 --> 00:30:19.600
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though your mind can push your body</v>

734
00:30:19.601 --> 00:30:23.230
<v Speaker 3>to extreme limits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oftentimes you get better results by not</v>

735
00:30:23.231 --> 00:30:26.470
<v Speaker 3>pushing your body to extreme limits by </v>
<v Speaker 3>pushing your body intelligently,</v>

736
00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:27.453
<v Speaker 3>allowing your by your body's sufficient </v>
<v Speaker 3>time to recover and then doing it again </v>

737
00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:34.630
<v Speaker 3>and then doing it more often,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but with less repetitions.</v>

738
00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:37.810
<v Speaker 3>So this is the thing I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been joking around like,</v>

739
00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:39.010
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lose weight is that,</v>

740
00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:40.570
<v Speaker 3>it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to do it for basketball.</v>

741
00:30:40.571 --> 00:30:41.404
<v Speaker 3>But the thing I love about working out </v>
<v Speaker 3>and basketball is it teaches you shit </v>

742
00:30:44.111 --> 00:30:45.130
<v Speaker 3>like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

743
00:30:45.370 --> 00:30:48.640
<v Speaker 3>Cause I think everything in the universe</v>
<v Speaker 3>has the same principles.</v>

744
00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:49.773
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you're cooking more is not </v>

745
00:30:51.431 --> 00:30:52.540
<v Speaker 3>always better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

746
00:30:52.570 --> 00:30:54.940
<v Speaker 3>If you're making music more is not </v>
<v Speaker 3>always better.</v>

747
00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:56.980
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like putting more things into a beat.</v>

748
00:30:57.730 --> 00:30:59.400
<v Speaker 3>You need negative space,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

749
00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:00.303
<v Speaker 3>Things need space,</v>
<v Speaker 3>time to breathe and then so does the </v>

750
00:31:02.381 --> 00:31:03.790
<v Speaker 3>human body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I agree.</v>

751
00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:08.820
<v Speaker 3>I don't do like exercises to fail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do them and my train is pretty good.</v>

752
00:31:09.311 --> 00:31:10.144
<v Speaker 3>Like we'll go in and we'll do like 18 </v>
<v Speaker 3>different exercises and we switch each </v>

753
00:31:12.401 --> 00:31:13.234
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like sets of three and going </v>

754
00:31:14.831 --> 00:31:16.420
<v Speaker 3>increasing in weight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've seen,</v>

755
00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:19.180
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you've seen this Jiro dreams of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sushi.</v>

756
00:31:19.181 --> 00:31:19.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

757
00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:20.291
<v Speaker 3>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

758
00:31:20.291 --> 00:31:22.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that I love about that</v>

759
00:31:22.121 --> 00:31:25.600
<v Speaker 3>is the simplicity of this guy's methods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that the,</v>

760
00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:27.250
<v Speaker 3>if you haven't seen a documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

761
00:31:27.251 --> 00:31:28.270
<v Speaker 3>I was so skeptical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

762
00:31:28.271 --> 00:31:30.970
<v Speaker 3>I'm not watching a fucking documentary </v>
<v Speaker 3>about due to make Sushi.</v>

763
00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:32.710
<v Speaker 3>Like how fucking hard is it to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>Sushi?</v>

764
00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:34.150
<v Speaker 3>Cut the fish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shut the fuck up.</v>

765
00:31:34.151 --> 00:31:35.620
<v Speaker 3>How hard is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard as fuck.</v>

766
00:31:35.650 --> 00:31:36.483
<v Speaker 3>It's hard as hell.</v>

767
00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:41.320
<v Speaker 3>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the methods of this guy,</v>

768
00:31:41.321 --> 00:31:43.660
<v Speaker 3>employees like you would think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

769
00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:45.490
<v Speaker 3>how hard is it to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

770
00:31:45.491 --> 00:31:46.324
<v Speaker 3>it's not necessarily that it's hard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a right way to do it where </v>

771
00:31:48.911 --> 00:31:50.710
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's figured out like,</v>

772
00:31:50.711 --> 00:31:51.544
<v Speaker 3>do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you add this amount of this or that </v>

773
00:31:52.901 --> 00:31:53.641
<v Speaker 3>amount of this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you,</v>

774
00:31:53.641 --> 00:31:55.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let it sit for six hours.</v>

775
00:31:55.301 --> 00:31:59.290
<v Speaker 3>You let it sit for 12 hours and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>nailed it and got it down to a science.</v>

776
00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:01.540
<v Speaker 3>But if you did anything more than what </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's doing,</v>

777
00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:03.260
<v Speaker 3>it would actually be less.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

778
00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:05.020
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a nice piece of seared.</v>

779
00:32:05.021 --> 00:32:07.690
<v Speaker 3>I for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how hard is that?</v>

780
00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:09.920
<v Speaker 3>It's not hard at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get a fresh piece of I he,</v>

781
00:32:09.921 --> 00:32:11.950
<v Speaker 3>you sear it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but God damn when it's done right,</v>

782
00:32:11.951 --> 00:32:12.940
<v Speaker 3>it tastes good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

783
00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:15.340
<v Speaker 3>Every culture is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's similar.</v>

784
00:32:15.341 --> 00:32:18.430
<v Speaker 3>You go eat like the original food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the traditional food authentic.</v>

785
00:32:18.431 --> 00:32:21.060
<v Speaker 3>Like I went to Sicily,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just read tuna,</v>

786
00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:21.903
<v Speaker 3>Sicilian red tuna on a griddle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the best restaurant I went to </v>

787
00:32:25.601 --> 00:32:26.434
<v Speaker 3>insistently who's doing tuna on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>griddle low heat with olive oil and it </v>

788
00:32:30.851 --> 00:32:34.210
<v Speaker 3>was just salt and it was the best piece </v>
<v Speaker 3>of two and I ever had.</v>

789
00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:35.170
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

790
00:32:35.470 --> 00:32:36.303
<v Speaker 3>you'll see it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we went to Piccola Napolli this episode </v>

791
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:40.100
<v Speaker 3>was good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're big on</v>

792
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:41.080
<v Speaker 5>seafood,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

793
00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:41.913
<v Speaker 5>Sicily's hugely is incredible on seafood</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they're very smart because they </v>

794
00:32:44.121 --> 00:32:46.700
<v Speaker 5>don't add much to it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just use their olive oil.</v>

795
00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:50.780
<v Speaker 5>That low heat sear,</v>
<v Speaker 5>real nice take the time is incredible.</v>

796
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:54.200
<v Speaker 5>Well I think that minimalism in a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 5>ways,</v>

797
00:32:54.201 --> 00:32:56.540
<v Speaker 5>like even in music,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a,</v>

798
00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:58.550
<v Speaker 5>sometimes you listen to an acoustic </v>
<v Speaker 5>song,</v>

799
00:32:58.551 --> 00:32:59.384
<v Speaker 5>just a dude in a guitar or a woman in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>guitar and it's the best song you've </v>

800
00:33:02.001 --> 00:33:02.750
<v Speaker 5>ever heard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

801
00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:03.583
<v Speaker 5>For that moment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean if there was one more piece of </v>

802
00:33:05.031 --> 00:33:07.160
<v Speaker 5>fishing equipment on the shirt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it fucking suck.</v>

803
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:08.833
<v Speaker 5>It'd be terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's just a net fishing equipment on </v>

804
00:33:11.721 --> 00:33:12.980
<v Speaker 5>this shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You love that shirt.</v>

805
00:33:12.981 --> 00:33:15.250
<v Speaker 5>Do I do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do.</v>

806
00:33:15.370 --> 00:33:17.420
<v Speaker 5>It all comes back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's all comes back to the shirt.</v>

807
00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:21.950
<v Speaker 5>Tell me about your new vice show man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do you got going on?</v>

808
00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:22.813
<v Speaker 5>It's been,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what this has been since I've </v>

809
00:33:24.021 --> 00:33:25.880
<v Speaker 5>met you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's been in the works.</v>

810
00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:26.743
<v Speaker 5>It almost,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like it's a five year journey </v>

811
00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:31.550
<v Speaker 5>really started this idea we and then we </v>
<v Speaker 5>went through it,</v>

812
00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:33.350
<v Speaker 5>did it on the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

813
00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:34.213
<v Speaker 5>eight minute clips,</v>
<v Speaker 5>10 minute clips and we did that for two </v>

814
00:33:36.081 --> 00:33:36.914
<v Speaker 5>years and the last two years I haven't </v>
<v Speaker 5>had any episodes out because we've just </v>

815
00:33:41.901 --> 00:33:42.734
<v Speaker 5>been grinding and we'd been in the lab </v>
<v Speaker 5>eight episodes and it took us eight </v>

816
00:33:46.161 --> 00:33:46.994
<v Speaker 5>years and I have to give respect.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know a lot of people look at say </v>

817
00:33:50.331 --> 00:33:51.164
<v Speaker 5>other travel shows or Tony Bourdain and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you hear a lot of people pitch things </v>

818
00:33:54.171 --> 00:33:56.540
<v Speaker 5>around town in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

819
00:33:56.541 --> 00:33:59.050
<v Speaker 5>This is like the new Tony Bourdain or </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the Newtonian [inaudible].</v>

820
00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:03.260
<v Speaker 5>You know what we got in the lab and we </v>
<v Speaker 5>made an hour long travel show.</v>

821
00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:04.183
<v Speaker 5>It's a similar format and you know thing</v>
<v Speaker 5>that Tony is doing because he created </v>

822
00:34:09.261 --> 00:34:12.110
<v Speaker 5>this format and I have to pay respect.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's hard as fuck.</v>

823
00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:13.333
<v Speaker 5>But what Tony did was he was the first </v>
<v Speaker 5>guy that ever had a cooking show that I </v>

824
00:34:15.141 --> 00:34:16.580
<v Speaker 5>want to hang out with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

825
00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:21.020
<v Speaker 5>And Tony is the first one that put a </v>
<v Speaker 5>narrative to a cooking show.</v>

826
00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:24.230
<v Speaker 5>He gave it a narrative in a story and </v>
<v Speaker 5>character.</v>

827
00:34:24.231 --> 00:34:25.064
<v Speaker 5>And so he created this format that a lot</v>
<v Speaker 5>of people have like followed in his </v>

828
00:34:28.491 --> 00:34:31.700
<v Speaker 5>footsteps.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I've always felt like,</v>

829
00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:32.901
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I started,</v>

830
00:34:32.901 --> 00:34:33.680
<v Speaker 5>people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh no,</v>

831
00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:34.513
<v Speaker 5>it's Tony or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And Tony was really helpful to me in my </v>

832
00:34:36.411 --> 00:34:38.720
<v Speaker 5>career and he really supported me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I was like,</v>

833
00:34:38.721 --> 00:34:39.554
<v Speaker 5>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>My purpose in life wasn't to be another </v>

834
00:34:41.691 --> 00:34:42.524
<v Speaker 5>version of my dad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My Dad wanted me to work in a steak </v>

835
00:34:44.481 --> 00:34:45.314
<v Speaker 5>house when I was a kid and just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you own this restaurant after me and </v>

836
00:34:48.471 --> 00:34:49.250
<v Speaker 5>we're going to sell steak.</v>

837
00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:50.450
<v Speaker 5>That's what the wall is doing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>

838
00:34:50.451 --> 00:34:51.284
<v Speaker 5>Dad,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that can be the point to </v>

839
00:34:52.891 --> 00:34:53.724
<v Speaker 5>my life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It can't be just to emulate you and be </v>

840
00:34:55.491 --> 00:34:56.324
<v Speaker 5>like you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And when it came to me doing this fight </v>

841
00:34:59.301 --> 00:35:00.134
<v Speaker 5>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been for five years figuring out </v>

842
00:35:02.481 --> 00:35:06.590
<v Speaker 5>how to get my voice and my story and the</v>
<v Speaker 5>things I care about.</v>

843
00:35:06.591 --> 00:35:07.424
<v Speaker 5>The translate to tape and it looked,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it maybe looked a lot easier than I </v>

844
00:35:11.181 --> 00:35:12.014
<v Speaker 5>thought it did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But once you get to it and you start to </v>

845
00:35:13.851 --> 00:35:17.750
<v Speaker 5>see what really makes these shows great,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you want to honor it,</v>

846
00:35:17.751 --> 00:35:19.460
<v Speaker 5>you want to respect it and you want to </v>
<v Speaker 5>work hard.</v>

847
00:35:19.461 --> 00:35:22.070
<v Speaker 5>So we took two years to make these eight</v>
<v Speaker 5>episodes.</v>

848
00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:24.230
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a long ass time.</v>

849
00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:25.220
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

850
00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:26.533
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you're trying to create a </v>

851
00:35:27.381 --> 00:35:28.214
<v Speaker 5>television show,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it takes a while for a show to find its </v>

852
00:35:30.291 --> 00:35:31.310
<v Speaker 5>legs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

853
00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:33.050
<v Speaker 5>To figure out what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

854
00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:33.943
<v Speaker 5>With anything,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even with the city column or a talk </v>

855
00:35:35.481 --> 00:35:36.740
<v Speaker 5>show,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

856
00:35:36.741 --> 00:35:37.410
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

857
00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:39.600
<v Speaker 5>I was there for the early days that </v>
<v Speaker 5>Conan O'brien show.</v>

858
00:35:39.601 --> 00:35:42.250
<v Speaker 5>One of my buddies was one of the writers</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I got to see them do it and it's,</v>

859
00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:43.230
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was,</v>

860
00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:44.460
<v Speaker 5>I remember being there going,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

861
00:35:44.461 --> 00:35:47.690
<v Speaker 5>it's going to be interesting to see how </v>
<v Speaker 5>this works out because this is obviously</v>

862
00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:50.360
<v Speaker 5>lot on Bambi legs right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it's like,</v>

863
00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:52.120
<v Speaker 5>like a fawn.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

864
00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:55.950
<v Speaker 5>My thing was I always had the vision and</v>
<v Speaker 5>I knew what I wanted to do,</v>

865
00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:57.113
<v Speaker 5>so that was part one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then the last few years have been </v>

866
00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:01.590
<v Speaker 5>actually doing it and then once you do </v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

867
00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:05.550
<v Speaker 5>the hardest part in this town is </v>
<v Speaker 5>convincing other people that they should</v>

868
00:36:05.551 --> 00:36:07.170
<v Speaker 5>put it out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

869
00:36:07.171 --> 00:36:08.760
<v Speaker 5>because other people look at it and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're like,</v>

870
00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:11.710
<v Speaker 5>oh well it's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not like Tony and it's not like the</v>

871
00:36:11.711 --> 00:36:12.690
<v Speaker 5>show,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like what is this?</v>

872
00:36:12.690 --> 00:36:14.070
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's different.</v>

873
00:36:14.071 --> 00:36:14.904
<v Speaker 5>And that's the point because I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>want to go make a show that's like </v>

874
00:36:17.341 --> 00:36:18.174
<v Speaker 5>anybody else's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It may be the same time format and you </v>

875
00:36:20.491 --> 00:36:23.040
<v Speaker 5>say 44 minute travel show,</v>
<v Speaker 5>structured,</v>

876
00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:24.480
<v Speaker 5>unstructured reality,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

877
00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:26.460
<v Speaker 5>But I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is a new thing.</v>

878
00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:30.000
<v Speaker 5>But it took me a long time to get the </v>
<v Speaker 5>vision,</v>

879
00:36:30.001 --> 00:36:32.460
<v Speaker 5>create it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then get people to believe in it.</v>

880
00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:33.893
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>getting people to believe in your shit </v>

881
00:36:35.251 --> 00:36:37.740
<v Speaker 5>is I think the hardest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That third step is the hardest part.</v>

882
00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:40.190
<v Speaker 5>Well who did you need to get to believe </v>
<v Speaker 5>it because you're doing it on advice,</v>

883
00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:41.130
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

884
00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:42.293
<v Speaker 5>Shane already believes in you and Shane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Shane is the one that gives me the </v>

885
00:36:45.451 --> 00:36:46.261
<v Speaker 5>freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Shane,</v>

886
00:36:46.261 --> 00:36:47.820
<v Speaker 5>Eddie Murray,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're the ones that let me do it,</v>

887
00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:49.920
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they're not there every day.</v>

888
00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:53.160
<v Speaker 5>So this is a show runner and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 5>producer and then all these people,</v>

889
00:36:53.161 --> 00:36:56.070
<v Speaker 5>cause we out in Fukushima shooting </v>
<v Speaker 5>radioactive wolves and shit.</v>

890
00:36:56.950 --> 00:36:58.160
<v Speaker 5>Mother Fucker,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's the man.</v>

891
00:36:58.161 --> 00:37:00.320
<v Speaker 5>I saw him last night,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Shane's the man and he,</v>

892
00:37:00.321 --> 00:37:02.800
<v Speaker 5>he always gives me the freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's,</v>

893
00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:06.570
<v Speaker 5>it's even the people on your crew </v>
<v Speaker 5>getting everybody to buy in and believe.</v>

894
00:37:06.571 --> 00:37:09.720
<v Speaker 5>And we came back with the footage and </v>
<v Speaker 5>these things,</v>

895
00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:14.130
<v Speaker 5>it gets into post and then everybody who</v>
<v Speaker 5>gets to watch an and post has an opinion</v>

896
00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:16.260
<v Speaker 5>about what this show should be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I just,</v>

897
00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:19.440
<v Speaker 5>I fought and fought and fought all eight</v>
<v Speaker 5>of these episodes.</v>

898
00:37:19.441 --> 00:37:23.160
<v Speaker 5>Finally we're going to put them out and </v>
<v Speaker 5>all eight of them are exactly how I feel</v>

899
00:37:23.161 --> 00:37:25.710
<v Speaker 5>about the places I visited and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>people we met.</v>

900
00:37:26.130 --> 00:37:29.700
<v Speaker 5>And my biggest struggle was travel </v>
<v Speaker 5>shows.</v>

901
00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:30.593
<v Speaker 5>They voiceover a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of voiceover and it's </v>

902
00:37:33.091 --> 00:37:33.924
<v Speaker 5>almost like these shows are written </v>
<v Speaker 5>before people go to these towns and </v>

903
00:37:36.601 --> 00:37:37.434
<v Speaker 5>these cities and what the people say.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes it doesn't matter because the </v>

904
00:37:40.891 --> 00:37:41.724
<v Speaker 5>producer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whoever's going has already decided the </v>

905
00:37:43.261 --> 00:37:44.180
<v Speaker 5>story wants to tell.</v>

906
00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:45.533
<v Speaker 5>I go out there and we booked the scenes </v>
<v Speaker 5>and the thing that made everybody </v>

907
00:37:49.471 --> 00:37:51.540
<v Speaker 5>nervous and pre preproduction was I was </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

908
00:37:51.570 --> 00:37:52.403
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what these people are going</v>
<v Speaker 5>to say and we're going to live with the </v>

909
00:37:54.061 --> 00:37:54.900
<v Speaker 5>footage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they're like,</v>

910
00:37:54.901 --> 00:37:56.280
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to have an idea.</v>

911
00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:58.380
<v Speaker 5>You have to like direct the </v>
<v Speaker 5>conversation.</v>

912
00:37:58.381 --> 00:38:01.050
<v Speaker 5>We need a write voiceover and we need to</v>
<v Speaker 5>set it up.</v>

913
00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:03.510
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's just go to these towns,</v>

914
00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:06.720
<v Speaker 5>meet these people and let them tell us </v>
<v Speaker 5>about their lives,</v>

915
00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:09.510
<v Speaker 5>their cities,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their identities and except the footage.</v>

916
00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:12.660
<v Speaker 5>And I think being honest,</v>
<v Speaker 5>accepting footage,</v>

917
00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:14.693
<v Speaker 5>not manipulating the footage with a ton </v>
<v Speaker 5>of voiceover is the real innovation of </v>

918
00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:20.310
<v Speaker 5>our show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's verite.</v>

919
00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:24.290
<v Speaker 5>You see us making the show,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it's never like you're not aware of,</v>

920
00:38:24.291 --> 00:38:26.490
<v Speaker 5>we're making a show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You see what is the,</v>

921
00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:27.750
<v Speaker 5>what is the premise of the show?</v>

922
00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:33.200
<v Speaker 5>I'm exploring and deconstructing </v>
<v Speaker 5>identities through what people eat does.</v>

923
00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:34.980
<v Speaker 5>You're basically like going through </v>
<v Speaker 5>their shit.</v>

924
00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:36.160
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's in your poop?</v>

925
00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:37.840
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fucking red tuna,</v>

926
00:38:37.841 --> 00:38:38.800
<v Speaker 5>olive oil,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

927
00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:43.630
<v Speaker 5>But I'm going through these countries </v>
<v Speaker 5>and exploring their history and identity</v>

928
00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:44.553
<v Speaker 5>just through what they eat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because what you eat tells you so much </v>

929
00:38:46.631 --> 00:38:48.670
<v Speaker 5>about who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your culture,</v>

930
00:38:48.671 --> 00:38:49.780
<v Speaker 5>your values,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your politics,</v>

931
00:38:49.781 --> 00:38:52.360
<v Speaker 5>and your history and what has happened </v>
<v Speaker 5>to your ancestors.</v>

932
00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:54.460
<v Speaker 5>Like where'd you go?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cecily?</v>

933
00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:57.160
<v Speaker 5>Istanbul.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

934
00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:58.690
<v Speaker 5>Hunan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>China.</v>

935
00:38:58.691 --> 00:38:59.501
<v Speaker 5>Sand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't China.</v>

936
00:38:59.501 --> 00:39:03.370
<v Speaker 5>Taiwan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Orlando Juarez.</v>

937
00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:05.260
<v Speaker 5>Mexicali.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You went to Warren?</v>

938
00:39:05.290 --> 00:39:06.760
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Went to Juarez.</v>

939
00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:08.950
<v Speaker 5>It was great puzzle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Very credible.</v>

940
00:39:09.010 --> 00:39:10.120
<v Speaker 5>It's not scary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

941
00:39:10.121 --> 00:39:12.370
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I never would oversell it until you,</v>

942
00:39:12.371 --> 00:39:14.260
<v Speaker 5>those fucking just fucking scary out </v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

943
00:39:14.261 --> 00:39:15.220
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

944
00:39:15.221 --> 00:39:16.054
<v Speaker 5>everyone there had a story of somebody </v>
<v Speaker 5>in their family being killed or </v>

945
00:39:19.691 --> 00:39:23.230
<v Speaker 5>kidnapped or robbed is bad and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's bad.</v>

946
00:39:23.410 --> 00:39:27.160
<v Speaker 5>But when we went out there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I cannot claim that it was hard or rough</v>

947
00:39:27.161 --> 00:39:27.994
<v Speaker 5>for us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We rode bikes through the city and </v>

948
00:39:29.891 --> 00:39:30.724
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of these kids out there </v>
<v Speaker 5>doing things trying to take back wall </v>

949
00:39:32.671 --> 00:39:33.504
<v Speaker 5>brass.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you may look at like a bike ride </v>

950
00:39:37.121 --> 00:39:38.910
<v Speaker 5>through your town here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like some hipster,</v>

951
00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:40.810
<v Speaker 5>weird yuppy thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but in Juarez they were like,</v>

952
00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:42.033
<v Speaker 5>we even,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we would just love the right to be </v>

953
00:39:43.751 --> 00:39:44.584
<v Speaker 5>yuppies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you know I have the freedom to be </v>

954
00:39:45.911 --> 00:39:48.940
<v Speaker 5>yuppies and this time we can't even ride</v>
<v Speaker 5>our bikes without a problem here.</v>

955
00:39:49.330 --> 00:39:51.790
<v Speaker 5>So we rode bikes with like 50,</v>
<v Speaker 5>60 kids.</v>

956
00:39:51.791 --> 00:39:54.850
<v Speaker 5>And while that's just kind of civil </v>
<v Speaker 5>disobedience,</v>

957
00:39:54.851 --> 00:39:56.980
<v Speaker 5>trying to take back the streets by </v>
<v Speaker 5>riding through them.</v>

958
00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:57.873
<v Speaker 5>So it was it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you say they would like to be able </v>

959
00:39:59.951 --> 00:40:00.784
<v Speaker 5>to ride bikes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like it's just because of the drug </v>

960
00:40:01.901 --> 00:40:02.290
<v Speaker 5>violence.</v>

961
00:40:02.290 --> 00:40:04.900
<v Speaker 5>They does a lot of islands.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of violence.</v>

962
00:40:04.901 --> 00:40:07.330
<v Speaker 5>People are afraid to go outside.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

963
00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:08.193
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is one of the symbolic things that </v>

964
00:40:09.941 --> 00:40:10.774
<v Speaker 5>the youth out there do if they try to </v>
<v Speaker 5>take back the city and the town by </v>

965
00:40:14.321 --> 00:40:16.410
<v Speaker 5>riding through it with bikes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Got Butter coffees.</v>

966
00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:17.253
<v Speaker 5>Got You.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Huh?</v>

967
00:40:18.590 --> 00:40:21.340
<v Speaker 5>Keep another coffee is killing me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's great.</v>

968
00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:23.650
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so like what kind of food?</v>

969
00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:24.543
<v Speaker 5>Obviously Mexican food,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but like what kind of food we were </v>

970
00:40:26.561 --> 00:40:27.394
<v Speaker 5>getting in wars.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The best food I had was outside the </v>

971
00:40:30.941 --> 00:40:31.774
<v Speaker 5>nightclubs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was this one little Taco stand in </v>

972
00:40:34.541 --> 00:40:37.930
<v Speaker 5>Juarez on the main strip that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

973
00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:38.793
<v Speaker 5>the rolling stones,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whoever used to go perform at the main </v>

974
00:40:40.601 --> 00:40:45.490
<v Speaker 5>venue in Juarez after the show there was</v>
<v Speaker 5>this small taco spot.</v>

975
00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:46.353
<v Speaker 5>All they do is like El Pastore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You go over there and that was the best </v>

976
00:40:48.971 --> 00:40:49.804
<v Speaker 5>Taco I've ever had.</v>

977
00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:51.990
<v Speaker 5>What does that stand for?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll pet store.</v>

978
00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.500
<v Speaker 5>What does it mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's uh,</v>

979
00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:55.970
<v Speaker 5>the pastor?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

980
00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:57.393
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just know you get pineapples and it's </v>

981
00:40:58.511 --> 00:41:01.660
<v Speaker 5>grilled pork and it's on a spit and it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>incredible.</v>

983
00:41:03.970 --> 00:41:04.803

<v Speaker 5>But that Al Pastore Taco was the best I </v>

984
00:41:07.721 --> 00:41:08.770
<v Speaker 5>had.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

985
00:41:08.830 --> 00:41:10.650
<v Speaker 5>And the rolling stones used to go there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

986
00:41:10.690 --> 00:41:14.110
<v Speaker 5>after the shows and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How long ago were they going to Juarez?</v>

987
00:41:14.111 --> 00:41:14.944
<v Speaker 5>Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like in the seventies seventies </v>

<v Speaker 5>they would do the shows and El Paso and </v>

990
00:41:21.011 --> 00:41:22.990
<v Speaker 5>then cross over and shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

991
00:41:23.110 --> 00:41:23.943
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So do shows in El Paso and then go to </v>

992
00:41:25.301 --> 00:41:27.940
<v Speaker 5>Mexico for food and then they also did </v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

993
00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:32.200
<v Speaker 5>I believe I have to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have to catch myself.</v>

994
00:41:32.201 --> 00:41:34.040
<v Speaker 5>I have to check the tape.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't remember if</v>

995
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:34.873
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they did the shows and I'll pass when </v>

996
00:41:35.481 --> 00:41:37.550
<v Speaker 3>went to Juarez,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the party after or it's,</v>

997
00:41:37.551 --> 00:41:38.384
<v Speaker 3>they did the show in Juarez and went to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Taco stand because they did have a </v>

998
00:41:40.851 --> 00:41:43.550
<v Speaker 3>venue next door to this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think at some bands did.</v>

999
00:41:43.551 --> 00:41:44.384
<v Speaker 3>El Paso came over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some bands did the venue next to the </v>

1000
00:41:46.341 --> 00:41:48.470
<v Speaker 3>Taco spot and went over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it was a combination.</v>

1001
00:41:48.650 --> 00:41:49.730
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rolling Stone was,</v>

1002
00:41:49.731 --> 00:41:51.920
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember if they were El Paso or</v>
<v Speaker 3>warmers,</v>

1003
00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:52.783
<v Speaker 3>but there were tons of bands in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>triangle going back and forth between </v>

1004
00:41:55.611 --> 00:41:56.444
<v Speaker 3>the border and people would come across </v>
<v Speaker 3>the board at a party in Juarez and it </v>

1005
00:41:59.331 --> 00:42:01.330
<v Speaker 3>was a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was no big deal back then.</v>

1006
00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:03.620
<v Speaker 3>That's what's crazy is that when I was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>kid,</v>

1007
00:42:03.621 --> 00:42:06.710
<v Speaker 3>you never heard about violence in Mexico</v>
<v Speaker 3>piece should go to Mexico to party.</v>

1008
00:42:06.711 --> 00:42:09.830
<v Speaker 3>Everybody go to Aqua Poco to go to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Tijuana.</v>

1009
00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:11.330
<v Speaker 3>Tijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just fun.</v>

1010
00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:12.620
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was crazy.</v>

1011
00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:13.663
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would all talk about donkey shows </v>

1012
00:42:14.541 --> 00:42:16.550
<v Speaker 3>and all the crazy shit that you'd go </v>
<v Speaker 3>over there and see.</v>

1013
00:42:16.551 --> 00:42:17.384
<v Speaker 3>But it was never like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't go to Tijuana because of drug </v>

1014
00:42:19.941 --> 00:42:20.774
<v Speaker 3>violence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1015
00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:22.880
<v Speaker 3>That all happened during the Bush </v>
<v Speaker 3>administration.</v>

1016
00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:25.250
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to,</v>

1017
00:42:25.251 --> 00:42:26.310
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1018
00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:27.253
<v Speaker 3>Cancun and like a 2002 or something like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that for mtv and MTV did a spring break </v>

1019
00:42:33.981 --> 00:42:35.360
<v Speaker 3>thing down there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Man,</v>

<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was fun.</v>

1021
00:42:36.261 --> 00:42:39.920
<v Speaker 3>It was great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then within seven or eight years,</v>

1022
00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:41.180
<v Speaker 3>nobody would go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1023
00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:43.130
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>within seven or eight years,</v>

1024
00:42:43.131 --> 00:42:44.870
<v Speaker 3>everybody was terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And going to Mexico,</v>

1025
00:42:44.871 --> 00:42:48.200
<v Speaker 3>all you heard in the news,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm sure a lot of it was exaggerated</v>

1026
00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:49.840
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1027
00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:51.200
<v Speaker 3>if it bleeds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it leads,</v>

1028
00:42:51.201 --> 00:42:52.034
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If the news is going to show you some </v>

1029
00:42:52.611 --> 00:42:53.444
<v Speaker 3>shit about Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not going to show you al Pastore </v>

1030
00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:56.570
<v Speaker 3>Tacos and how great it is on the street.</v>

1031
00:42:56.930 --> 00:42:59.030
<v Speaker 3>The murders are real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then the thing is,</v>

1032
00:42:59.031 --> 00:43:01.430
<v Speaker 3>is that we have to remember in all these</v>
<v Speaker 3>towns,</v>

1033
00:43:01.431 --> 00:43:03.320
<v Speaker 3>you see these murders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see the gang violence,</v>

1034
00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:05.030
<v Speaker 3>there's real people living through that </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

1035
00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:07.610
<v Speaker 3>There's real people trying to live </v>
<v Speaker 3>normal lives.</v>

1036
00:43:07.611 --> 00:43:10.700
<v Speaker 3>And that's why we did this episode on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the border towns in Mexico.</v>

1037
00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:13.850
<v Speaker 3>We went to Tijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mexicali and Juarez,</v>

1038
00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:15.103
<v Speaker 3>and we tried to show the lives that </v>
<v Speaker 3>these people are trying to live next to </v>

1039
00:43:19.101 --> 00:43:19.934
<v Speaker 3>a superpower because just by the sheer </v>
<v Speaker 3>nature and geography of them living on </v>

1040
00:43:24.831 --> 00:43:25.664
<v Speaker 3>the border next to a superpower,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course crime is going to leak into </v>

1041
00:43:28.401 --> 00:43:29.234
<v Speaker 3>their towns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The dirts going to be done on their </v>

1042
00:43:30.201 --> 00:43:31.034
<v Speaker 3>side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The product's going to be sent to our </v>

1043
00:43:31.641 --> 00:43:32.840
<v Speaker 3>side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1044
00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:34.173
<v Speaker 3>And so we tried to capture their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's an example of one episode </v>

1045
00:43:36.891 --> 00:43:38.150
<v Speaker 3>of the show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1046
00:43:38.570 --> 00:43:39.403
<v Speaker 3>the other problem is they're like sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of see their economies completely </v>

1047
00:43:42.051 --> 00:43:42.884
<v Speaker 3>connected to the United States and a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>of ways where it's like there's plenty </v>

1048
00:43:45.681 --> 00:43:47.800
<v Speaker 3>of violence in America that we don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>even consider.</v>

1049
00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:52.610
<v Speaker 3>Like nobody's scared to go to Chicago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Chicago is fucked up,</v>

1050
00:43:52.611 --> 00:43:53.444
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's more gun violence in Chicago </v>

1051
00:43:54.981 --> 00:43:58.520
<v Speaker 3>than almost anywhere in North America in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chicago is terrible right now.</v>

1052
00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:00.970
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's definitely an American life.</v>

1053
00:44:01.070 --> 00:44:03.390
<v Speaker 3>It's the most murders in any cities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's cool.</v>

1054
00:44:03.391 --> 00:44:05.330
<v Speaker 3>It's right up there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's Chicago and Detroit,</v>

1055
00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:06.590
<v Speaker 3>but no one's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

1056
00:44:06.591 --> 00:44:09.380
<v Speaker 3>we can't go to Chicago on the South </v>
<v Speaker 3>Chicago,</v>

1057
00:44:09.381 --> 00:44:10.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1058
00:44:10.070 --> 00:44:11.730
<v Speaker 3>let's go to Chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1059
00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:13.790
<v Speaker 3>we don't even consider it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1060
00:44:13.791 --> 00:44:14.624
<v Speaker 3>it's all in the south side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean that's sort of the same way </v>

1061
00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:18.900
<v Speaker 3>people have to look at about Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'll do,</v>

1062
00:44:18.901 --> 00:44:22.970
<v Speaker 3>I do have tie this one story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to this resort recently in Mexico</v>

1063
00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:25.490
<v Speaker 3>near Puerto Vallarta and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

1064
00:44:25.491 --> 00:44:26.780
<v Speaker 3>this place is so pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1065
00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:29.930
<v Speaker 3>how is it that Mexico has all this drug </v>
<v Speaker 3>violence and all these problems,</v>

1066
00:44:29.931 --> 00:44:30.740
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1067
00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:31.920
<v Speaker 3>this beautiful resort</v>

1068
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:34.350
<v Speaker 1>and all these a wealthy people go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>vacation,</v>

1069
00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:35.213
<v Speaker 1>this resort and they had these little </v>
<v Speaker 1>golf carts that they give you on the </v>

1070
00:44:37.801 --> 00:44:38.634
<v Speaker 1>resort to move around the resort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we took the golf cart and they'll </v>

1071
00:44:40.801 --> 00:44:42.570
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can go into the city if you like,</v>

1072
00:44:42.571 --> 00:44:43.404
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could take the golf carts anywhere </v>

1073
00:44:43.921 --> 00:44:44.401
<v Speaker 1>you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1074
00:44:44.401 --> 00:44:45.420
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go into the city.</v>

1075
00:44:45.630 --> 00:44:46.463
<v Speaker 1>So we go into the city and we went a </v>
<v Speaker 1>block from that resort one block and we </v>

1076
00:44:51.901 --> 00:44:52.734
<v Speaker 1>found a fucking small military based </v>
<v Speaker 1>with armored vehicles with dude sitting </v>

1077
00:44:57.781 --> 00:44:58.614
<v Speaker 1>on their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on machine guns with steel plates in </v>

1078
00:45:01.021 --> 00:45:03.750
<v Speaker 1>front of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ready to rock at a moment's notice.</v>

1079
00:45:03.751 --> 00:45:08.160
<v Speaker 1>So that's how they keep these wealthy </v>
<v Speaker 1>people like protected.</v>

1080
00:45:08.161 --> 00:45:08.671
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1081
00:45:08.671 --> 00:45:11.730
<v Speaker 1>this is a wake up call right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the thing that like,</v>

1082
00:45:11.850 --> 00:45:16.470
<v Speaker 1>our leaders never do a good job of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>violence in the south side of Chicago.</v>

1083
00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:18.870
<v Speaker 1>That should affect all Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't.</v>

1084
00:45:19.170 --> 00:45:20.003
<v Speaker 1>And until it affects somebody who </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't live in the south side and the </v>

1085
00:45:22.891 --> 00:45:25.860
<v Speaker 1>murder accidentally bleeds into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong neighborhood on the north side,</v>

1086
00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:28.470
<v Speaker 1>nobody really cares.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody pays attention.</v>

1087
00:45:28.471 --> 00:45:29.304
<v Speaker 1>And that's why we went to Mexico too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's this border that is a </v>

1088
00:45:32.311 --> 00:45:34.640
<v Speaker 1>false border.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Mother Nature didn't put a board in</v>

1089
00:45:34.650 --> 00:45:35.690
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We put a fucking pillow.</v>

1090
00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:36.480
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gotcha.</v>

1091
00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:37.313
<v Speaker 1>That border Sun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God made the border between United </v>

1092
00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:42.090
<v Speaker 1>States and Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God made it that way.</v>

1093
00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:44.200
<v Speaker 1>God has a plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1094
00:45:44.201 --> 00:45:46.110
<v Speaker 1>We are the chosen people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1095
00:45:46.111 --> 00:45:48.600
<v Speaker 1>And so I just wanted to show like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

1096
00:45:48.930 --> 00:45:50.940
<v Speaker 1>on the other side of this artificial </v>
<v Speaker 1>line,</v>

1097
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:51.833
<v Speaker 1>this is what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And just because there are different </v>

1098
00:45:53.791 --> 00:45:55.380
<v Speaker 1>color than you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a different country.</v>

1099
00:45:55.650 --> 00:45:57.180
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean you shouldn't care about</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1100
00:45:57.181 --> 00:45:58.014
<v Speaker 1>Like this is a human problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well people are so terrified of opening </v>

1101
00:46:00.271 --> 00:46:03.010
<v Speaker 1>up the bores in Mexico and letting </v>
<v Speaker 1>people go back and forth there.</v>

1102
00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:03.873
<v Speaker 1>They're so terrified of the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But how many Mexicans are already over </v>

1103
00:46:06.601 --> 00:46:09.330
<v Speaker 1>here illegally and doesn't seem to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>that much of a problem.</v>

1104
00:46:09.610 --> 00:46:10.443
<v Speaker 1>And I mean there's plenty of natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>born Americans that are fucking things </v>

1105
00:46:12.931 --> 00:46:13.764
<v Speaker 1>up just as bad as anybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And most of the Mexicans I know are </v>

1106
00:46:16.561 --> 00:46:18.780
<v Speaker 1>hardworking people that are very </v>
<v Speaker 1>friendly.</v>

1107
00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:19.793
<v Speaker 1>Like if you go to Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you find like right </v>

1108
00:46:22.351 --> 00:46:25.530
<v Speaker 1>away is how friendly people are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexican is a nice place,</v>

1109
00:46:25.531 --> 00:46:27.240
<v Speaker 1>incredible place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>

1110
00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:31.080
<v Speaker 1>I never felt threatened or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is is that the world needs</v>

1111
00:46:31.081 --> 00:46:33.600
<v Speaker 1>more transparency and mobility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1112
00:46:33.601 --> 00:46:34.434
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that I noticed for two years </v>

1113
00:46:35.701 --> 00:46:37.890
<v Speaker 1>traveling around the globe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to all these places,</v>

1114
00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:39.113
<v Speaker 1>Mediterranean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sicily where there's immigration issues </v>

1115
00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:42.450
<v Speaker 1>is Stan Bull,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1116
00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:47.480
<v Speaker 1>Mexico on the borders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need transparency because the Po,</v>

1117
00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:52.110
<v Speaker 1>the leaders of this world are drawing </v>
<v Speaker 1>lines all around creating divisions that</v>

1118
00:46:52.111 --> 00:46:52.944
<v Speaker 1>are not there between me and you or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie or people in the in Mexico that I </v>

1119
00:46:56.011 --> 00:46:56.760
<v Speaker 1>met.</v>

1120
00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:57.593
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we need to have mobility because it </v>

1121
00:46:59.671 --> 00:47:00.504
<v Speaker 1>can't just be my dumb luck that I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>born in America and then I'm going to </v>

1122
00:47:03.631 --> 00:47:06.450
<v Speaker 1>have a better life because my mom pop </v>
<v Speaker 1>the squad here.</v>

1123
00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:07.440
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1124
00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:09.360
<v Speaker 1>it's sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I go around the world,</v>

1125
00:47:09.361 --> 00:47:09.931
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1126
00:47:09.931 --> 00:47:10.764
<v Speaker 1>if that person was born here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll probably be doing a better job </v>

1127
00:47:12.961 --> 00:47:13.794
<v Speaker 1>than me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I'm doing.</v>

1128
00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:16.530
<v Speaker 1>Well it's eroding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's eroding slowly but not,</v>

1129
00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:18.210
<v Speaker 1>not quick enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Clicking.</v>

1130
00:47:18.211 --> 00:47:18.900
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

1131
00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:19.733
<v Speaker 1>what used to be a necessity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we had to keep our tribe away from </v>

1132
00:47:22.291 --> 00:47:24.480
<v Speaker 1>invading tribes because we couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate with them.</v>

1133
00:47:24.690 --> 00:47:25.523
<v Speaker 1>We didn't know their language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People came from some other land to try </v>

1134
00:47:28.381 --> 00:47:30.250
<v Speaker 1>to take our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had a protect</v>

1135
00:47:30.250 --> 00:47:31.083
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would come over and boats and </v>

1136
00:47:31.661 --> 00:47:34.150
<v Speaker 2>they'd rape and pillage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not really the case anymore.</v>

1137
00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:36.860
<v Speaker 2>So there's necessity of having these </v>
<v Speaker 2>borders and,</v>

1138
00:47:36.861 --> 00:47:37.694
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and especially in 2016 having it where </v>

1139
00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:42.940
<v Speaker 2>you can't go back and forth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't even cross into lands,</v>

1140
00:47:42.941 --> 00:47:46.510
<v Speaker 2>lets you have the right papers and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely can't work here because you'd</v>

1141
00:47:46.511 --> 00:47:47.290
<v Speaker 2>be taking</v>

1142
00:47:47.290 --> 00:47:48.420
<v Speaker 1>jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1143
00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:51.670
<v Speaker 1>Taken our jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's plenty in the world man,</v>

1144
00:47:51.730 --> 00:47:53.240
<v Speaker 1>like people and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the what,</v>

1145
00:47:53.250 --> 00:47:55.660
<v Speaker 1>the 1% got to get better at sharing too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1146
00:47:55.661 --> 00:47:56.494
<v Speaker 1>cause there's people in the world that </v>
<v Speaker 1>just sit on piles of shit and it's not </v>

1147
00:47:59.531 --> 00:48:01.620
<v Speaker 1>in the economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's quite an ecosystem,</v>

1148
00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:03.560
<v Speaker 1>Dave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's,</v>

1149
00:48:04.270 --> 00:48:05.980
<v Speaker 1>there's Middle Eastern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's Chinese too.</v>

1150
00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:09.700
<v Speaker 1>Did a lot of Chinese people sitting on </v>
<v Speaker 1>piles of shit that's not moving well,</v>

1151
00:48:09.701 --> 00:48:10.930
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1152
00:48:10.931 --> 00:48:13.150
<v Speaker 1>we'll stockpiling wealth is a weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

1153
00:48:13.151 --> 00:48:13.984
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When people get to this point where </v>

1154
00:48:14.771 --> 00:48:15.910
<v Speaker 1>they're just constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1155
00:48:15.970 --> 00:48:17.620
<v Speaker 1>if you have like billions and billions </v>
<v Speaker 1>of dollars,</v>

1156
00:48:17.621 --> 00:48:21.070
<v Speaker 1>but yet you're still involved in </v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly trying to accumulate wealth,</v>

1157
00:48:21.130 --> 00:48:23.760
<v Speaker 1>that's a little weird too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to run this idea by you please.</v>

1158
00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:25.930
<v Speaker 1>I listen to his show and I love the idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you bring up,</v>

1159
00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:29.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm convinced and I wished there was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>politician that was,</v>

1160
00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:32.710
<v Speaker 1>that was promoting this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think there should be a salary cap</v>

1161
00:48:32.711 --> 00:48:33.544
<v Speaker 1>on the world.</v>

1162
00:48:33.550 --> 00:48:34.960
<v Speaker 1>A salary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>salary cap,</v>

1163
00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.360
<v Speaker 1>because you put it in sports and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>

1164
00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:38.950
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But think about it.</v>

1165
00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:39.813
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you ever need more than $500 </v>

1166
00:48:41.950 --> 00:48:42.460
<v Speaker 1>million?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Me?</v>

1167
00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:44.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plans to come on.</v>

1168
00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:46.630
<v Speaker 1>I need islands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

1169
00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:48.400
<v Speaker 1>Rocket ships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to go to the moon.</v>

1170
00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:51.910
<v Speaker 1>I feel like you could go to the moon for</v>
<v Speaker 1>under 500 Mil.</v>

1171
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.480
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't there that one dude,</v>

1172
00:48:54.790 --> 00:48:56.170
<v Speaker 1>the backstreet boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1173
00:48:56.530 --> 00:48:57.363
<v Speaker 1>Lance Bass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to go to the moon on a big </v>

1174
00:48:59.711 --> 00:49:00.544
<v Speaker 1>Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

1175
00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:03.680
<v Speaker 1>But okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you,</v>

1176
00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:06.490
<v Speaker 1>you would need more than 500 mil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1177
00:49:06.491 --> 00:49:07.181
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1178
00:49:07.181 --> 00:49:08.210
<v Speaker 1>not in real life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1179
00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:09.333
<v Speaker 1>not if I'm being serious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But here's how much money would get put </v>

1180
00:49:11.801 --> 00:49:15.010
<v Speaker 1>back into the market and like would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>distributed.</v>

1181
00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:20.040
<v Speaker 1>If you just set a salary cap at 500 Mil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that would break up so much money.</v>

1182
00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:21.670
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting,</v>

1183
00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:22.503
<v Speaker 2>but someone who makes more than $500 </v>
<v Speaker 2>million could take that money and </v>

1184
00:49:25.571 --> 00:49:28.990
<v Speaker 2>started gigantic business and hire </v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of millions of people.</v>

1185
00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:29.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just because,</v>

1186
00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:33.240
<v Speaker 1>do you have a hundred?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just promote reaganomics bro.</v>

1187
00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:34.853
<v Speaker 1>Trickle down economics is real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like God had us born here in </v>

1188
00:49:37.801 --> 00:49:39.760
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God also made it so</v>

1189
00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:42.160
<v Speaker 2>you don't have a salary cap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1190
00:49:42.330 --> 00:49:43.690
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting,</v>

1191
00:49:43.691 --> 00:49:47.230
<v Speaker 2>but if you play monopoly and which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what everybody's doing,</v>

1192
00:49:47.380 --> 00:49:48.213
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's,</v>

1193
00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:50.200
<v Speaker 2>there's plenty money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's a game?</v>

1194
00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:52.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's the gay capitalism in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of ways.</v>

1195
00:49:52.841 --> 00:49:53.674
<v Speaker 2>A lot like a game you're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>accumulate and some people are more </v>

1196
00:49:56.651 --> 00:50:00.070
<v Speaker 2>dedicated to that game and they try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>accumulate constantly.</v>

1197
00:50:00.310 --> 00:50:04.780
<v Speaker 2>I mean if I was more dedicated to just </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing the things that I do,</v>

1198
00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:07.750
<v Speaker 2>if I was more dedicated in a capitalist </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense,</v>

1199
00:50:07.751 --> 00:50:08.584
<v Speaker 2>I would accumulate more money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But my personal belief is that would </v>

1200
00:50:12.161 --> 00:50:16.000
<v Speaker 2>fuck with me creatively because it would</v>
<v Speaker 2>take away resources that I use for other</v>

1201
00:50:16.001 --> 00:50:16.834
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would fuck with the way I do the </v>

1202
00:50:18.401 --> 00:50:19.870
<v Speaker 2>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>

1203
00:50:20.230 --> 00:50:22.180
<v Speaker 2>if you only think about how much money </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can make,</v>

1204
00:50:22.181 --> 00:50:24.850
<v Speaker 2>there's certain things you wouldn't say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's certain ways you wouldn't speak.</v>

1205
00:50:25.210 --> 00:50:26.043
<v Speaker 2>And the ironic irony in my that would </v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimately cost me money cause my </v>

1206
00:50:29.211 --> 00:50:30.044
<v Speaker 2>product would suffer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think in a lot of ways the game of </v>

1207
00:50:34.251 --> 00:50:36.950
<v Speaker 2>capitalism itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just calling it a game,</v>

1208
00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:39.040
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it you,</v>

1209
00:50:39.530 --> 00:50:40.363
<v Speaker 2>it's very problematic if you have a cap </v>
<v Speaker 2>on how much money you can make in that </v>

1210
00:50:43.671 --> 00:50:45.980
<v Speaker 2>game because there's always going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>these outliers.</v>

1211
00:50:45.981 --> 00:50:50.000
<v Speaker 2>He's Michael Jordans of sport that take </v>
<v Speaker 2>things to the fucking end fill level and</v>

1212
00:50:50.001 --> 00:50:50.834
<v Speaker 2>go deep and want to make as much money </v>
<v Speaker 2>as they possibly can and I don't </v>

1213
00:50:53.601 --> 00:50:54.434
<v Speaker 2>necessarily think that that's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you should have the freedom to </v>

1214
00:50:56.811 --> 00:50:58.940
<v Speaker 2>be fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should have the freedom.</v>

1215
00:50:59.270 --> 00:51:00.103
<v Speaker 2>If you want to make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to be the first guy that makes </v>

1216
00:51:01.251 --> 00:51:03.800
<v Speaker 2>$100 billion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should have the freedom to do that,</v>

1217
00:51:04.010 --> 00:51:07.520
<v Speaker 2>but as a human being who makes that much</v>
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>

1218
00:51:07.790 --> 00:51:08.623
<v Speaker 2>you also should have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an understanding of what kind of an </v>

1219
00:51:11.151 --> 00:51:11.984
<v Speaker 2>impact you can have on other people with</v>
<v Speaker 2>that money from your own personal </v>

1220
00:51:15.651 --> 00:51:18.590
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can take that money and invest it in</v>

1221
00:51:18.591 --> 00:51:20.930
<v Speaker 2>different communities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can start programs,</v>

1222
00:51:20.931 --> 00:51:24.230
<v Speaker 2>you could give people scholarships.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could do all this amazing stuff with</v>

1223
00:51:24.231 --> 00:51:27.380
<v Speaker 2>that money that you wouldn't be able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do if somebody put a cap and said,</v>

1224
00:51:27.381 --> 00:51:28.610
<v Speaker 2>you can only make 500 million bucks,</v>

1225
00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:30.600
<v Speaker 5>but here's the way I see money,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1226
00:51:30.660 --> 00:51:33.480
<v Speaker 5>Money is something we've created.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Money is,</v>

1227
00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:37.500
<v Speaker 5>is a man made creation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This idea of money is to attach value to</v>

1228
00:51:37.501 --> 00:51:38.700
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what money is.</v>

1229
00:51:38.701 --> 00:51:42.870
<v Speaker 5>So the game isn't making money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Money's like an award.</v>

1230
00:51:42.990 --> 00:51:45.210
<v Speaker 5>So it's like if a movie director was </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1231
00:51:45.211 --> 00:51:47.070
<v Speaker 5>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I make movies to win Oscars,</v>

1232
00:51:47.130 --> 00:51:50.010
<v Speaker 5>that's not what the game is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It should be to make a great film,</v>

1233
00:51:50.070 --> 00:51:52.410
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You should be to live a good life and we</v>

1234
00:51:52.411 --> 00:51:53.244
<v Speaker 5>reward you along the way because if you </v>
<v Speaker 5>do things that are of value to a </v>

1235
00:51:55.411 --> 00:51:56.880
<v Speaker 5>society,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we pay you,</v>

1236
00:51:56.930 --> 00:51:57.763
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

1237
00:51:57.990 --> 00:52:00.540
<v Speaker 5>But the game is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the game is basketball.</v>

1238
00:52:00.541 --> 00:52:01.620
<v Speaker 5>The game is football.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The game,</v>

1239
00:52:01.621 --> 00:52:04.770
<v Speaker 5>his movies to game is podcasting or </v>
<v Speaker 5>truth telling.</v>

1240
00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:05.633
<v Speaker 5>It's not making money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's where I think human beings </v>

1241
00:52:08.341 --> 00:52:12.930
<v Speaker 5>and society have lost their way because </v>
<v Speaker 5>now it's just about winning the award.</v>

1242
00:52:12.931 --> 00:52:14.510
<v Speaker 5>It's not about doing the work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if,</v>

1243
00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:15.340
<v Speaker 5>where's that money</v>

1244
00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:16.720
<v Speaker 2>go though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the problem.</v>

1245
00:52:17.020 --> 00:52:17.920
<v Speaker 2>Here's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was saying,</v>

1246
00:52:17.921 --> 00:52:20.440
<v Speaker 2>if you say Eddie Wong could only make </v>
<v Speaker 2>$500 million a year,</v>

1247
00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:24.520
<v Speaker 2>but all of a sudden your Bolan and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>hit that ceiling tank,</v>

1248
00:52:24.521 --> 00:52:25.354
<v Speaker 2>tank,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tank,</v>

1249
00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:27.670
<v Speaker 2>you're just slamming up against that </v>
<v Speaker 2>ceiling and every year and you're like,</v>

1250
00:52:27.671 --> 00:52:28.121
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1251
00:52:28.121 --> 00:52:28.954
<v Speaker 2>I would have made $3 billion this year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I only made 500 million because </v>

1252
00:52:33.101 --> 00:52:36.040
<v Speaker 2>there's a fucking cap on this bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could have taken that money.</v>

1253
00:52:36.041 --> 00:52:38.950
<v Speaker 2>I could invest it in communities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could've started all these,</v>

1254
00:52:39.130 --> 00:52:42.640
<v Speaker 2>these centers for a young kids and helps</v>
<v Speaker 2>them out.</v>

1255
00:52:42.860 --> 00:52:45.950
<v Speaker 5>People I know and you if,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say you had 500 Mil,</v>

1256
00:52:45.951 --> 00:52:48.290
<v Speaker 5>you couldn't make any more.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I bet you'd still do this podcast.</v>

1257
00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:50.690
<v Speaker 5>I bet you'd still be working out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'd still be telling jokes.</v>

1258
00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:52.070
<v Speaker 5>I'm still living on a mountain.</v>

1259
00:52:52.420 --> 00:52:53.260
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the government.</v>

1260
00:52:53.290 --> 00:52:55.870
<v Speaker 2>Where's the rest of my fucking money?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you'd be taping it,</v>

1261
00:52:55.990 --> 00:52:57.430
<v Speaker 2>but what would you do with the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the money?</v>

1262
00:52:57.431 --> 00:52:58.264
<v Speaker 2>How's it work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say like save you made $3 billion one </v>

1263
00:53:01.031 --> 00:53:03.580
<v Speaker 2>year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the cap was at 500 million,</v>

1264
00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:07.090
<v Speaker 2>so they just cut you off and all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rest of that money goes where.</v>

1265
00:53:08.810 --> 00:53:09.470
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you just,</v>

1266
00:53:09.470 --> 00:53:10.910
<v Speaker 5>your idea sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Come on.</v>

1267
00:53:10.911 --> 00:53:13.180
<v Speaker 5>No fucking idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have a few.</v>

1268
00:53:13.370 --> 00:53:14.203
<v Speaker 5>I have a few government.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It wouldn't be the rubber for wealth </v>

1269
00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:23.030
<v Speaker 5>now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that you have to then find a way</v>

1270
00:53:23.060 --> 00:53:25.890
<v Speaker 5>to distribute it through nonprofits and </v>
<v Speaker 5>things like that.</v>

1271
00:53:26.170 --> 00:53:27.530
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cross,</v>

1272
00:53:27.550 --> 00:53:29.910
<v Speaker 5>we're like 80% of the money goes to </v>
<v Speaker 5>bullshit.</v>

1273
00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:31.140
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't even go to the actual,</v>

1274
00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:33.270
<v Speaker 5>we would have to build a better </v>
<v Speaker 5>infrastructure.</v>

1275
00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:34.343
<v Speaker 5>We would have to build a better </v>
<v Speaker 5>infrastructure for social services and </v>

1276
00:53:36.781 --> 00:53:38.400
<v Speaker 5>public interests and things like that </v>
<v Speaker 5>because yes,</v>

1277
00:53:38.610 --> 00:53:39.443
<v Speaker 5>the nonprofit sector,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of the times it's super </v>

1278
00:53:41.071 --> 00:53:45.360
<v Speaker 5>ineffective at remedying the issues that</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody's giving them money for.</v>

1279
00:53:45.850 --> 00:53:46.683
<v Speaker 2>Problem is that there's so much money </v>
<v Speaker 2>involved in red tape and bullshit and </v>

1280
00:53:50.510 --> 00:53:54.430
<v Speaker 2>employees and overhead and all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>different operating costs.</v>

1281
00:53:54.550 --> 00:53:55.383
<v Speaker 2>When you look at the actual operating </v>
<v Speaker 2>cost involved in charities and you </v>

1282
00:53:58.511 --> 00:53:59.344
<v Speaker 2>compare it to how much money actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>goes to the charity that you're sending </v>

1283
00:54:01.271 --> 00:54:03.640
<v Speaker 2>money to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's disturbing and it makes people feel</v>

1284
00:54:03.641 --> 00:54:04.180
<v Speaker 2>sad.</v>

1285
00:54:04.180 --> 00:54:05.013
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll tell you this like I just think </v>

1286
00:54:06.351 --> 00:54:07.184
<v Speaker 5>that we have to reconfigure our,</v>
<v Speaker 5>our values and how we value things and </v>

1287
00:54:11.811 --> 00:54:15.790
<v Speaker 5>like we're stuck on this money thing </v>
<v Speaker 5>like the human species is.</v>

1288
00:54:15.791 --> 00:54:17.420
<v Speaker 5>So we're stuck on money.</v>

1289
00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:20.060
<v Speaker 2>Well I think we're stuck on money </v>
<v Speaker 2>because a lot of people don't have it.</v>

1290
00:54:20.380 --> 00:54:23.090
<v Speaker 2>So it's the ultimate thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people have too much of it.</v>

1291
00:54:23.330 --> 00:54:25.520
<v Speaker 2>Some people do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when you don't have money,</v>

1292
00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:27.740
<v Speaker 2>like when I was young and I didn't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>any money,</v>

1293
00:54:27.741 --> 00:54:30.020
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember the first check that I got,</v>

1294
00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:30.913
<v Speaker 2>I got a big check from Disney.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got a development deal when I was </v>

1295
00:54:33.201 --> 00:54:37.640
<v Speaker 2>like 24 and all of a sudden I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to worry about my bills.</v>

1296
00:54:37.700 --> 00:54:38.533
<v Speaker 2>It was the first time in my life I </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't have to worry about my bills and </v>

1297
00:54:40.401 --> 00:54:42.260
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my rent is taken care of this month.</v>

1298
00:54:42.410 --> 00:54:43.243
<v Speaker 2>I can go out to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I remember it was like a physical </v>

1299
00:54:45.831 --> 00:54:49.730
<v Speaker 2>feeling of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a physical feeling of relaxation.</v>

1300
00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:50.833
<v Speaker 2>Like now all of a sudden the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the overhead cloud of debt and worry </v>

1301
00:54:55.311 --> 00:54:59.660
<v Speaker 2>about my bills had lifted and the sun </v>
<v Speaker 2>was shining and I was like,</v>

1302
00:54:59.690 --> 00:55:03.020
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I will never forget that feeling.</v>

1303
00:55:03.140 --> 00:55:03.973
<v Speaker 2>So does that feeling was a revelation as</v>
<v Speaker 2>far as like how much stress I was under </v>

1304
00:55:07.671 --> 00:55:09.950
<v Speaker 2>and most people are under on a daily </v>
<v Speaker 2>basis.</v>

1305
00:55:10.070 --> 00:55:12.830
<v Speaker 2>So because of that stress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what people think about is,</v>

1306
00:55:12.831 --> 00:55:13.664
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to make money because that is the </v>

1307
00:55:14.871 --> 00:55:16.880
<v Speaker 2>way to get away from this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>stress.</v>

1308
00:55:17.660 --> 00:55:18.493
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it becomes this carrot that if </v>

1309
00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:21.140
<v Speaker 2>we ever get to eat,</v>

1310
00:55:21.570 --> 00:55:22.980
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>money angling carry,</v>

1311
00:55:23.020 --> 00:55:24.300
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>money gives you freedom.</v>

1312
00:55:24.301 --> 00:55:26.790
<v Speaker 5>And my brother emory's idea with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>salary cap things,</v>

1313
00:55:26.791 --> 00:55:28.140
<v Speaker 5>he's a bit of a futurist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

1314
00:55:28.141 --> 00:55:29.850
<v Speaker 5>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I read a lot of these things.</v>

1315
00:55:29.851 --> 00:55:33.060
<v Speaker 5>Robots can do a lot of our agriculture </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the future.</v>

1316
00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:34.193
<v Speaker 5>We can have a lot of our processes that </v>
<v Speaker 5>require human beings to clock in and </v>

1317
00:55:37.381 --> 00:55:41.190
<v Speaker 5>clock out and punch buttons to like go </v>
<v Speaker 5>to robots in the future.</v>

1318
00:55:41.250 --> 00:55:41.791
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I see.</v>

1319
00:55:41.791 --> 00:55:43.860
<v Speaker 5>What you're trying to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're trying to get rid of the American</v>

1320
00:55:43.861 --> 00:55:45.150
<v Speaker 5>farmer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

1321
00:55:45.450 --> 00:55:47.160
<v Speaker 5>so he says this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he says this,</v>

1322
00:55:47.161 --> 00:55:48.900
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he was like,</v>

1323
00:55:48.930 --> 00:55:50.700
<v Speaker 5>some people want to play the game.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Eddie,</v>

1324
00:55:50.701 --> 00:55:52.120
<v Speaker 5>he's like you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you wake up everyday,</v>

1325
00:55:52.170 --> 00:55:53.700
<v Speaker 5>you want to write,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you want to go do something,</v>

1326
00:55:53.701 --> 00:55:54.690
<v Speaker 5>you want to be productive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

1327
00:55:54.691 --> 00:55:56.670
<v Speaker 5>some people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they just want to live.</v>

1328
00:55:57.030 --> 00:55:59.730
<v Speaker 5>And so after the salary cap,</v>
<v Speaker 5>after 500 million,</v>

1329
00:56:00.060 --> 00:56:00.893
<v Speaker 5>what of that money from those </v>
<v Speaker 5>billionaires and one percenters goes </v>

1330
00:56:03.721 --> 00:56:04.980
<v Speaker 5>into,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1331
00:56:05.010 --> 00:56:07.830
<v Speaker 5>guaranteeing a baseline amount of </v>
<v Speaker 5>wealth.</v>

1332
00:56:07.831 --> 00:56:08.664
<v Speaker 5>Maybe it's $30,000,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it goes to American people who are </v>

1333
00:56:10.921 --> 00:56:12.390
<v Speaker 5>not making that much money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's like,</v>

1334
00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:14.640
<v Speaker 5>here's 30,000.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here's your bills taken care of.</v>

1335
00:56:14.641 --> 00:56:17.190
<v Speaker 5>Here's an apartment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now you have no excuse.</v>

1336
00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:20.070
<v Speaker 5>You have no excuse.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Go do something you care about.</v>

1337
00:56:20.071 --> 00:56:23.100
<v Speaker 5>Go do something you love,</v>
<v Speaker 5>contribute back to society because this,</v>

1338
00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:24.280
<v Speaker 5>the disguise making</v>

1339
00:56:24.310 --> 00:56:27.880
<v Speaker 1>is going to guarantee you baseline </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of living if you really do,</v>

1340
00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:28.733
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you really do like reading youtube </v>

1341
00:56:30.521 --> 00:56:31.354
<v Speaker 1>comments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>read the comments on how retarded that </v>

1342
00:56:32.740 --> 00:56:35.980
<v Speaker 1>ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because people are fucking lazy and they</v>

1343
00:56:35.981 --> 00:56:38.440
<v Speaker 1>don't give people guaranteed money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to do shit.</v>

1344
00:56:38.590 --> 00:56:39.423
<v Speaker 1>They're gonna Jack off into the street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to take shits on the cars </v>

1345
00:56:42.011 --> 00:56:43.930
<v Speaker 1>as they pass by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to do whatever.</v>

1346
00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:47.500
<v Speaker 1>They're lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're doing it anyway.</v>

1347
00:56:47.540 --> 00:56:52.540
<v Speaker 1>But you remove the incentive to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you give people your,</v>

1348
00:56:52.811 --> 00:56:55.930
<v Speaker 1>you're going to create a welfare world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you have robots,</v>

1349
00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:56.793
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have robots doing this stuff </v>

1350
00:56:57.881 --> 00:56:58.714
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is my brother's thing and I'll </v>

1351
00:56:59.291 --> 00:57:01.150
<v Speaker 1>fight for his or idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have,</v>

1352
00:57:01.180 --> 00:57:02.800
<v Speaker 1>if you have robots that can do </v>
<v Speaker 1>agriculture,</v>

1353
00:57:02.830 --> 00:57:04.960
<v Speaker 1>and it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's machines everywhere.</v>

1354
00:57:04.961 --> 00:57:06.790
<v Speaker 1>They're doing things that humans used to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

1355
00:57:07.090 --> 00:57:07.923
<v Speaker 1>In the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we will have machines that can do a lot </v>

1356
00:57:09.551 --> 00:57:11.650
<v Speaker 1>of the processes that humans do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's like,</v>

1357
00:57:11.651 --> 00:57:13.990
<v Speaker 1>why continue to penalize people who just</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't,</v>

1358
00:57:14.170 --> 00:57:17.290
<v Speaker 1>they don't have the drive and they don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to do things analyzing them.</v>

1359
00:57:17.320 --> 00:57:18.153
<v Speaker 1>They have to pull their own weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the whole reason why there's an </v>

1360
00:57:21.371 --> 00:57:22.770
<v Speaker 1>incentive to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1361
00:57:22.910 --> 00:57:26.560
<v Speaker 1>It's because if you work you a thing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't just survive,</v>

1362
00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:29.650
<v Speaker 1>you earn something and you get to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand that effort.</v>

1363
00:57:30.190 --> 00:57:31.023
<v Speaker 1>Kidney reward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now people don't have effort equals </v>

1364
00:57:33.401 --> 00:57:35.560
<v Speaker 1>reward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The government just gives you a reward.</v>

1365
00:57:35.710 --> 00:57:36.543
<v Speaker 1>Then it becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how come I only took 30,000 I could </v>

1366
00:57:38.981 --> 00:57:43.981
<v Speaker 1>barely get born on 30,000 when Bill </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] Camaro.</v>

1367
00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:48.850
<v Speaker 1>But then you're looking at the worst of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the worst.</v>

1368
00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:49.713
<v Speaker 1>You'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people know that </v>

1369
00:57:51.220 --> 00:57:51.911
<v Speaker 1>nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1370
00:57:51.911 --> 00:57:52.744
<v Speaker 1>If you take people from scratch and give</v>
<v Speaker 1>and make them entitled from scratch and </v>

1371
00:57:56.651 --> 00:58:00.280
<v Speaker 1>just have them programmed to think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>money comes free and it's coming off,</v>

1372
00:58:00.281 --> 00:58:02.350
<v Speaker 1>and then you have a nation of spoiled </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids,</v>

1373
00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:04.740
<v Speaker 1>you ever seen a spoiled rich parents?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1374
00:58:05.010 --> 00:58:07.980
<v Speaker 1>they want you to spoil all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me ask you this.</v>

1375
00:58:08.810 --> 00:58:11.170
<v Speaker 1>Motivational.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think you can change people?</v>

1376
00:58:11.230 --> 00:58:13.300
<v Speaker 1>You definitely could change them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you give him $30,000 a year,</v>

1377
00:58:13.301 --> 00:58:15.250
<v Speaker 1>you can make them lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can.</v>

1378
00:58:15.700 --> 00:58:17.890
<v Speaker 1>You make people lazy and they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>earn that money,</v>

1379
00:58:17.891 --> 00:58:20.320
<v Speaker 1>then you can't just give people money </v>
<v Speaker 1>for no reason.</v>

1380
00:58:20.530 --> 00:58:23.860
<v Speaker 1>That and help people contributes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make a better society.</v>

1381
00:58:23.861 --> 00:58:26.470
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to make your baseline </v>
<v Speaker 1>people shelter,</v>

1382
00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:27.550
<v Speaker 1>clothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>food,</v>

1383
00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:30.100
<v Speaker 1>health services.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to thin the herd.</v>

1384
00:58:30.310 --> 00:58:31.960
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want wolves in the streets.</v>

1385
00:58:31.990 --> 00:58:33.910
<v Speaker 1>I want to make it harder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want end to that.</v>

1386
00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:34.833
<v Speaker 1>I want people to get into that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To live in the woods for a month out of </v>

1387
00:58:37.661 --> 00:58:38.780
<v Speaker 1>the year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1388
00:58:39.130 --> 00:58:40.840
<v Speaker 1>I've just worked with some people where </v>
<v Speaker 1>men,</v>

1389
00:58:40.870 --> 00:58:44.560
<v Speaker 1>there's these people who work super hard</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we can't pay them enough.</v>

1390
00:58:44.590 --> 00:58:46.630
<v Speaker 1>It's not in the budget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not the opportunity,</v>

1391
00:58:47.080 --> 00:58:47.980
<v Speaker 1>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1392
00:58:47.981 --> 00:58:49.330
<v Speaker 1>I wish I could do more for this guy.</v>

1393
00:58:49.390 --> 00:58:50.380
<v Speaker 1>Then there's Pete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>

1394
00:58:50.381 --> 00:58:51.214
<v Speaker 1>Like what people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a very utopic guys that work on </v>

1395
00:58:53.831 --> 00:58:54.664
<v Speaker 1>the show would make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's guys and girls that work on the </v>

1396
00:58:56.111 --> 00:58:57.970
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>APS thinks like that and I'm like,</v>

1397
00:58:57.971 --> 00:58:58.804
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

1398
00:58:59.140 --> 00:59:01.420
<v Speaker 1>I wish we could pay him more because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think you're doing great work,</v>

1399
00:59:01.421 --> 00:59:05.110
<v Speaker 1>but the economics of this project and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this show,</v>

1400
00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:06.273
<v Speaker 1>this is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I have people who've I've worked </v>

1401
00:59:08.411 --> 00:59:10.960
<v Speaker 1>with on other shows where they just </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't show up.</v>

1402
00:59:11.380 --> 00:59:12.910
<v Speaker 1>They don't show up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't work hard.</v>

1403
00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:14.530
<v Speaker 1>They're just clocking in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clocking out,</v>

1404
00:59:14.531 --> 00:59:15.660
<v Speaker 1>and they don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1405
00:59:15.670 --> 00:59:17.990
<v Speaker 1>but then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that never change that dial.</v>

1406
00:59:18.010 --> 00:59:19.780
<v Speaker 1>Never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will never change that guy.</v>

1407
00:59:19.810 --> 00:59:20.643
<v Speaker 1>They might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they would have to have sort of a </v>

1408
00:59:21.441 --> 00:59:22.160
<v Speaker 1>life affirming</v>

1409
00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:22.993
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like something would have to happen in </v>

1410
00:59:23.961 --> 00:59:26.240
<v Speaker 3>near death experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll losing a loved one,</v>

1411
00:59:26.450 --> 00:59:28.580
<v Speaker 3>a revelation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a psychedelic drug experience,</v>

1412
00:59:28.581 --> 00:59:30.650
<v Speaker 3>but some of his fights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my biggest,</v>

1413
00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:32.240
<v Speaker 3>my biggest failures in life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>

1414
00:59:32.300 --> 00:59:33.133
<v Speaker 3>is me trying to inspire or give </v>
<v Speaker 3>motivation to someone who just does not </v>

1415
00:59:36.351 --> 00:59:37.460
<v Speaker 3>care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1416
00:59:37.461 --> 00:59:38.294
<v Speaker 3>you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

1417
00:59:38.300 --> 00:59:39.133
<v Speaker 3>if you give people $30,000 a year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what you're gonna get to be a </v>

1418
00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:42.833
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People need insulin check off somewhere </v>

1419
00:59:45.891 --> 00:59:47.510
<v Speaker 3>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They need an incentive.</v>

1420
00:59:47.511 --> 00:59:49.820
<v Speaker 3>They need,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they need something to get them to work.</v>

1421
00:59:49.821 --> 00:59:50.654
<v Speaker 3>And then in doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you create people that understand and </v>

1422
00:59:52.971 --> 00:59:57.200
<v Speaker 3>value hard work and discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's not just about making money.</v>

1423
00:59:57.350 --> 00:59:58.183
<v Speaker 3>It's also about understanding yourself </v>
<v Speaker 3>and knowing that you can accomplish </v>

1424
01:00:00.321 --> 01:00:03.080
<v Speaker 3>things and not just accomplish things </v>
<v Speaker 3>from a financial standpoint,</v>

1425
01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:04.033
<v Speaker 3>but accomplish things as far as like </v>
<v Speaker 3>going on a diet and taking care of your </v>

1426
01:00:06.021 --> 01:00:08.240
<v Speaker 3>health,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pursuing an athletic goal,</v>

1427
01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:12.530
<v Speaker 3>pursuing a creative goal of like </v>
<v Speaker 3>finishing a book or writing a manuscript</v>

1428
01:00:12.531 --> 01:00:13.010
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1429
01:00:13.010 --> 01:00:13.843
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of things that people </v>

1430
01:00:14.811 --> 01:00:17.090
<v Speaker 3>won't do if you just give them money.</v>

1431
01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:18.260
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

1432
01:00:18.350 --> 01:00:22.590
<v Speaker 3>I've met a lot of crappy entitled people</v>
<v Speaker 3>who they,</v>

1433
01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:25.190
<v Speaker 3>they don't give an effort because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have to.</v>

1434
01:00:25.191 --> 01:00:28.340
<v Speaker 3>There are a lot of those people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then I meet a lot of people who they</v>

1435
01:00:28.341 --> 01:00:30.920
<v Speaker 3>just don't have their baseline needs and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a part of me that's like,</v>

1436
01:00:30.921 --> 01:00:31.754
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish I could guarantee baseline needs </v>

1437
01:00:34.191 --> 01:00:35.930
<v Speaker 3>for these people because even if they </v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted to work,</v>

1438
01:00:35.931 --> 01:00:37.460
<v Speaker 3>there isn't an opportunity for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

1439
01:00:37.461 --> 01:00:40.430
<v Speaker 3>but your baseline needs all right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In this country,</v>

1440
01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:41.703
<v Speaker 3>if w if you look at like the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people in this country that have </v>

1441
01:00:45.441 --> 01:00:46.274
<v Speaker 3>baseline need issues and how much money </v>
<v Speaker 3>they earn as opposed to the rest of the </v>

1442
01:00:49.221 --> 01:00:50.054
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1443
01:00:50.090 --> 01:00:52.130
<v Speaker 3>this is a crazy statistic that I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>quoted before.</v>

1444
01:00:52.310 --> 01:00:56.120
<v Speaker 3>If you make more than $34,000 a year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are in the 1% of the world,</v>

1445
01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:58.670
<v Speaker 3>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the planet earth.</v>

1446
01:00:58.850 --> 01:01:01.760
<v Speaker 3>But living in America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you make $30,000 there's some people,</v>

1447
01:01:01.761 --> 01:01:02.594
<v Speaker 3>men like they can't even pay parking </v>
<v Speaker 3>tickets and they ended up in jail and </v>

1448
01:01:05.511 --> 01:01:07.490
<v Speaker 3>they have jobs and they work and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking hard.</v>

1449
01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:10.520
<v Speaker 3>Parking tickets get you in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really get there's,</v>

1450
01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:12.830
<v Speaker 3>there's a few cases,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

1451
01:01:12.860 --> 01:01:13.693
<v Speaker 3>not a few.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's tons of cases where you don't </v>

1452
01:01:15.411 --> 01:01:16.244
<v Speaker 3>pay your parking tickets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They pull you over again late parking </v>

1453
01:01:18.831 --> 01:01:20.660
<v Speaker 3>tickets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll end up putting you in jail.</v>

1454
01:01:20.990 --> 01:01:23.330
<v Speaker 3>Like there was a case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was in,</v>

1455
01:01:24.140 --> 01:01:25.940
<v Speaker 3>I think there was a couple of cases in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Ferguson,</v>

1456
01:01:25.941 --> 01:01:28.520
<v Speaker 3>Missouri that people were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>last year with,</v>

1457
01:01:28.610 --> 01:01:29.443
<v Speaker 3>with a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a couple of people who did not have the </v>

1458
01:01:32.391 --> 01:01:33.224
<v Speaker 3>money to pay their parking tickets or </v>
<v Speaker 3>traffic violations and that over time </v>

1459
01:01:35.991 --> 01:01:37.280
<v Speaker 3>you can't pay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you end up in jail.</v>

1460
01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:39.440
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a cycle that's kind of crazy.</v>

1461
01:01:39.470 --> 01:01:41.960
<v Speaker 3>And then this is definitely not have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>look at Jamie,</v>

1462
01:01:42.530 --> 01:01:43.010
<v Speaker 3>let's not.</v>

1463
01:01:43.010 --> 01:01:43.843
<v Speaker 3>But if it can definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean definitely do better than put </v>

1464
01:01:47.091 --> 01:01:49.940
<v Speaker 3>people in jail for not I parking tickets</v>
<v Speaker 3>are fucking ridiculous.</v>

1465
01:01:49.941 --> 01:01:50.774
<v Speaker 3>First of all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if there's a violation as far as </v>

1466
01:01:53.191 --> 01:01:55.850
<v Speaker 3>like some on parking in front of a fire </v>
<v Speaker 3>hydrant or something like that,</v>

1467
01:01:55.851 --> 01:01:58.460
<v Speaker 3>that makes sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or parking in front of a driveway,</v>

1468
01:01:58.461 --> 01:02:00.980
<v Speaker 3>like that kind of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the idea of charging,</v>

1469
01:02:00.981 --> 01:02:02.930
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the idea that you're charging people</v>

1470
01:02:02.931 --> 01:02:03.764
<v Speaker 3>to park on the street,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking gross anyway that you have </v>

1471
01:02:05.691 --> 01:02:09.290
<v Speaker 3>a meter and I have to put money in his </v>
<v Speaker 3>meter so I could park my car.</v>

1472
01:02:09.340 --> 01:02:10.480
<v Speaker 3>I bought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck you.</v>

1473
01:02:10.780 --> 01:02:11.510
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are p,</v>

1474
01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:13.550
<v Speaker 3>these are streets that were paying for </v>
<v Speaker 3>with our taxes.</v>

1475
01:02:13.551 --> 01:02:15.950
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a public street.</v>

1476
01:02:16.190 --> 01:02:17.023
<v Speaker 3>And the idea that you're going to just </v>
<v Speaker 3>steal money from people because they </v>

1477
01:02:18.930 --> 01:02:20.100
<v Speaker 3>have to park somewhere.</v>

1478
01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:21.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's gross.</v>

1479
01:02:21.181 --> 01:02:22.014
<v Speaker 2>And not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have this fucking asshole and a bus </v>

1480
01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:26.730
<v Speaker 2>or there's little scooter thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>goes around and gives tickets.</v>

1481
01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:30.210
<v Speaker 2>Then march your tire would chalk to make</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure that you're,</v>

1482
01:02:30.211 --> 01:02:31.044
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've,</v>

1483
01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:34.530
<v Speaker 2>you've not been parking there for </v>
<v Speaker 2>northern 90 minutes.</v>

1484
01:02:34.531 --> 01:02:37.170
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you a ticket for that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all gross man.</v>

1485
01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:38.160
<v Speaker 2>Oh that shit's gross.</v>

1486
01:02:38.330 --> 01:02:39.750
<v Speaker 5>Either way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Next time I come on India,</v>

1487
01:02:39.770 --> 01:02:41.900
<v Speaker 5>have more fully fleshed out salary cap </v>
<v Speaker 5>idea.</v>

1488
01:02:41.930 --> 01:02:44.390
<v Speaker 5>But I'm telling you like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been thinking about this thing that</v>

1489
01:02:45.940 --> 01:02:47.650
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's,</v>

1490
01:02:47.651 --> 01:02:49.630
<v Speaker 2>there's gotta be ways that are better </v>
<v Speaker 2>than that.</v>

1491
01:02:49.660 --> 01:02:52.540
<v Speaker 2>And the big way is my feeling if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1492
01:02:52.541 --> 01:02:53.374
<v Speaker 2>I've discussed this before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my feeling that this country has a </v>

1493
01:02:57.551 --> 01:03:00.190
<v Speaker 2>lot of places where you're like </v>
<v Speaker 2>Baltimore.</v>

1494
01:03:00.430 --> 01:03:02.830
<v Speaker 2>I had Michael Wood on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the podcast before.</v>

1495
01:03:02.831 --> 01:03:03.664
<v Speaker 2>He's a former police officer from </v>
<v Speaker 2>Baltimore who talked about how crazy it </v>

1496
01:03:07.361 --> 01:03:09.790
<v Speaker 2>is there and how they would find when he</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a cop.</v>

1497
01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:10.653
<v Speaker 2>They found this manifest from like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>1970s it was a directive of like a how </v>

1498
01:03:15.251 --> 01:03:16.084
<v Speaker 2>to engage in different areas and where </v>
<v Speaker 2>the crime is and where the drug </v>

1499
01:03:18.881 --> 01:03:21.400
<v Speaker 2>violences and where the breaking room </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's like,</v>

1500
01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:22.593
<v Speaker 2>this was the same shit that we were </v>
<v Speaker 2>dealing with in the two thousands he's </v>

1501
01:03:26.411 --> 01:03:29.650
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this same areas the same problems?</v>

1502
01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:33.490
<v Speaker 2>The same exact like this is where the </v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs are,</v>

1503
01:03:33.491 --> 01:03:34.690
<v Speaker 2>this is what the crime is.</v>

1504
01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:36.130
<v Speaker 2>It was the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1505
01:03:36.131 --> 01:03:39.870
<v Speaker 2>no one fixed it and when you're stuck in</v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of a cycle,</v>

1506
01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:42.100
<v Speaker 2>that is where the government should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>sending money.</v>

1507
01:03:42.101 --> 01:03:42.934
<v Speaker 2>Where's always setting money?</v>
<v Speaker 2>These countries sending money to </v>

1508
01:03:45.011 --> 01:03:47.950
<v Speaker 2>Afghanistan and Iraq and trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>rebuild nations.</v>

1509
01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:49.750
<v Speaker 2>How about rebuild this fucking nation?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1510
01:03:49.780 --> 01:03:53.170
<v Speaker 2>How about these problems that we have?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we want this country to be stronger,</v>

1511
01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:56.140
<v Speaker 2>the best way to make a stronger country </v>
<v Speaker 2>is to have less losers.</v>

1512
01:03:56.310 --> 01:03:58.180
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now when you get a shitty hand,</v>

1513
01:03:58.300 --> 01:04:00.610
<v Speaker 2>if you have two ones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have four aces,</v>

1514
01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:03.010
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck man come one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1515
01:04:03.070 --> 01:04:03.903
<v Speaker 2>we had to figure out a way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to figure out a way to make the </v>

1516
01:04:07.061 --> 01:04:10.900
<v Speaker 2>hands that people are dealt with in life</v>
<v Speaker 2>far easier to move with.</v>

1517
01:04:10.930 --> 01:04:11.763
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's a lot of people that are </v>

1518
01:04:12.371 --> 01:04:13.204
<v Speaker 2>dealt with a fucking terrible shitty </v>
<v Speaker 2>hand and we just turn a blind eye </v>

1519
01:04:16.690 --> 01:04:20.080
<v Speaker 2>towards these terrible impoverished </v>
<v Speaker 2>communities that are fucking filled with</v>

1520
01:04:20.081 --> 01:04:22.660
<v Speaker 2>crime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And these children that grow up there,</v>

1521
01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:23.613
<v Speaker 2>by the time they get to be 17 and 18 </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've seen so much shit and the </v>

1522
01:04:26.201 --> 01:04:27.034
<v Speaker 2>program programming in their mind is so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so disturbing because everything that </v>

1523
01:04:32.231 --> 01:04:34.230
<v Speaker 2>they've been involved with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything they've seen,</v>

1524
01:04:34.390 --> 01:04:36.220
<v Speaker 2>they've seen loved ones getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>carceration.</v>

1525
01:04:36.221 --> 01:04:38.620
<v Speaker 2>They seen people get shot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've seen crime,</v>

1526
01:04:38.621 --> 01:04:41.710
<v Speaker 2>they've seen a lack of hope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've seen police brutality,</v>

1527
01:04:41.711 --> 01:04:45.100
<v Speaker 2>they seen all these terrible things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is what we need to clean up in this</v>

1528
01:04:45.101 --> 01:04:45.934
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Ski people from making tons of </v>

1529
01:04:47.651 --> 01:04:48.350
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1530
01:04:48.350 --> 01:04:49.340
<v Speaker 5>the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all right,</v>

1531
01:04:49.370 --> 01:04:50.203
<v Speaker 5>if I take the salary cap thing of when,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my idea is this though is I want to </v>

1532
01:04:53.301 --> 01:04:56.330
<v Speaker 5>guarantee a baseline of living for </v>
<v Speaker 5>people in America.</v>

1533
01:04:56.331 --> 01:04:58.700
<v Speaker 5>So it's like there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they have to work for that.</v>

1534
01:04:58.730 --> 01:05:01.580
<v Speaker 5>So you don't even know what you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if someone doesn't let us,</v>

1535
01:05:01.581 --> 01:05:03.130
<v Speaker 5>somebody just wants to sit there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Food,</v>

1536
01:05:03.131 --> 01:05:05.480
<v Speaker 5>mood Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know a lot of people that want to work</v>

1537
01:05:05.481 --> 01:05:07.730
<v Speaker 5>and they can't get jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well that's a different story.</v>

1538
01:05:07.731 --> 01:05:08.564
<v Speaker 5>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're born in some of those </v>

1539
01:05:09.291 --> 01:05:11.540
<v Speaker 5>communities,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the key word you said is hope.</v>

1540
01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:12.593
<v Speaker 5>A lot of kids don't have hope.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember a kid that I used to hustle </v>

1541
01:05:15.321 --> 01:05:16.280
<v Speaker 5>with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is a good guy.</v>

1542
01:05:16.990 --> 01:05:17.823
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We,</v>

1543
01:05:18.050 --> 01:05:20.440
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we sold shit outside the cake shop,</v>

1544
01:05:20.470 --> 01:05:21.460
<v Speaker 5>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

1545
01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:22.900
<v Speaker 5>Weed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was selling weed,</v>

1546
01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:24.400
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not a big deal.</v>

1547
01:05:24.610 --> 01:05:25.450
<v Speaker 5>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Weed,</v>

1548
01:05:25.451 --> 01:05:26.920
<v Speaker 5>Xanax,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sound silly things.</v>

1549
01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:28.480
<v Speaker 5>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then,</v>

1550
01:05:28.481 --> 01:05:29.314
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he also was like a a night manager at </v>

1551
01:05:32.591 --> 01:05:33.630
<v Speaker 5>target.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1552
01:05:33.631 --> 01:05:35.890
<v Speaker 5>And he's a night manager at target.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of wasting away.</v>

1553
01:05:36.190 --> 01:05:39.310
<v Speaker 5>He was like 1920 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Incredible basketball player.</v>

1554
01:05:39.311 --> 01:05:40.144
<v Speaker 5>One of the best a IU basketball players.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've seen and he got offers to play at </v>

1555
01:05:44.171 --> 01:05:45.004
<v Speaker 5>some jucos and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I remember one day we went up to </v>

1556
01:05:48.491 --> 01:05:50.910
<v Speaker 5>Harlem to get the work and I was coming </v>
<v Speaker 5>back down on the train.</v>

1557
01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:51.753
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fam,</v>

1558
01:05:51.790 --> 01:05:54.340
<v Speaker 5>you should sign up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You should go to that Juco.</v>

1559
01:05:54.370 --> 01:05:56.980
<v Speaker 5>You should enroll.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like right now it's July,</v>

1560
01:05:57.100 --> 01:05:57.933
<v Speaker 5>there's still time you enroll now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could be in there for the fall </v>

1561
01:06:00.550 --> 01:06:03.520
<v Speaker 5>semester and you could play ball.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're 19 years old to this man.</v>

1562
01:06:04.030 --> 01:06:06.850
<v Speaker 5>And I remember we just passed the stop </v>
<v Speaker 5>and he's like,</v>

1563
01:06:07.150 --> 01:06:08.440
<v Speaker 5>Nah man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it'll never happen.</v>

1564
01:06:08.441 --> 01:06:09.274
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why?</v>

1565
01:06:09.730 --> 01:06:11.350
<v Speaker 5>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't get it Eddie.</v>

1566
01:06:11.620 --> 01:06:16.030
<v Speaker 5>Like the way you are your parents,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like Dave taught you,</v>

1567
01:06:16.031 --> 01:06:18.340
<v Speaker 5>you have a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't have a chance.</v>

1568
01:06:18.370 --> 01:06:19.840
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been told my whole life,</v>

1569
01:06:19.841 --> 01:06:21.370
<v Speaker 5>I don't have a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1570
01:06:21.371 --> 01:06:24.400
<v Speaker 5>I live with my grandmother and whether </v>
<v Speaker 5>he's right or not,</v>

1571
01:06:24.430 --> 01:06:26.290
<v Speaker 5>I disagree with him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He does have a chance.</v>

1572
01:06:26.291 --> 01:06:29.470
<v Speaker 5>But he had psychologically been broken,</v>
<v Speaker 5>had no hope,</v>

1573
01:06:29.471 --> 01:06:31.060
<v Speaker 5>and did not believe he could do </v>
<v Speaker 5>anything.</v>

1574
01:06:31.061 --> 01:06:31.894
<v Speaker 5>And when I saw that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it fundamentally changed me because it </v>

1575
01:06:34.241 --> 01:06:34.900
<v Speaker 5>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ma,</v>

1576
01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:37.540
<v Speaker 5>I'm privileged.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm privileged because my parents,</v>

1577
01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:40.390
<v Speaker 5>maybe they beat the crap Outta me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe they were hard on me,</v>

1578
01:06:40.391 --> 01:06:41.224
<v Speaker 5>but I never,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I never didn't feel like I had a chance </v>

1579
01:06:44.411 --> 01:06:45.340
<v Speaker 5>if I worked hard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1580
01:06:45.550 --> 01:06:46.383
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of people in this world </v>
<v Speaker 5>that just for 20 years they've lived in </v>

1581
01:06:48.851 --> 01:06:50.770
<v Speaker 5>America and they like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even if I worked hard,</v>

1582
01:06:51.070 --> 01:06:53.760
<v Speaker 5>even I see my parents working hard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We just never got the opportunity.</v>

1583
01:06:53.810 --> 01:06:54.643
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1584
01:06:55.540 --> 01:06:56.373
<v Speaker 2>There's thousands and thousands and </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of stories of people who grew </v>

1585
01:06:58.841 --> 01:06:59.674
<v Speaker 2>up in similar environments that didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>have that mindset that even though they </v>

1586
01:07:01.781 --> 01:07:03.340
<v Speaker 2>were told they didn't have any hope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they said,</v>

1587
01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:05.480
<v Speaker 2>I'll show you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they went out and they made,</v>

1588
01:07:05.510 --> 01:07:07.810
<v Speaker 2>made their shit happen and they became </v>
<v Speaker 2>rich and successful.</v>

1589
01:07:07.870 --> 01:07:09.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy could have been that.</v>

1590
01:07:09.430 --> 01:07:13.450
<v Speaker 2>He chose to feel sorry for himself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were telling him some good things.</v>

1591
01:07:13.451 --> 01:07:14.284
<v Speaker 2>You were giving him some good advice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't want to listen and he didn't </v>

1592
01:07:16.451 --> 01:07:17.284
<v Speaker 2>want to listen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was telling you is consciously </v>

1593
01:07:18.821 --> 01:07:21.550
<v Speaker 2>aware that he had been programmed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>think there was no hope,</v>

1594
01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:23.710
<v Speaker 2>if that's what he was telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's on him,</v>

1595
01:07:23.711 --> 01:07:25.150
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's always going to be that.</v>

1596
01:07:25.151 --> 01:07:25.984
<v Speaker 2>And that is an example for you because </v>
<v Speaker 2>the people that fail on this weird </v>

1597
01:07:29.140 --> 01:07:33.610
<v Speaker 2>fucking race that we're all in or this </v>
<v Speaker 2>weird experience that were on when they,</v>

1598
01:07:33.611 --> 01:07:35.830
<v Speaker 2>when they fail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can't help them,</v>

1599
01:07:35.831 --> 01:07:37.300
<v Speaker 2>at least you can learn from them.</v>

1600
01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:38.433
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we can look along the way a </v>

1601
01:07:39.381 --> 01:07:42.040
<v Speaker 2>different people that have done terrible</v>
<v Speaker 2>things and we could say,</v>

1602
01:07:42.041 --> 01:07:42.874
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they did was awful and they should </v>

1603
01:07:43.631 --> 01:07:46.060
<v Speaker 2>be punished.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that is almost definitely true.</v>

1604
01:07:46.270 --> 01:07:47.103
<v Speaker 2>But also we can learn that this could </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen to anybody who's in the wrong </v>

1605
01:07:50.831 --> 01:07:51.664
<v Speaker 2>circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had the wrong mindset and chooses the </v>

1606
01:07:53.411 --> 01:07:54.850
<v Speaker 2>wrong actions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These,</v>

1607
01:07:54.851 --> 01:07:56.800
<v Speaker 2>all these things are important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are,</v>

1608
01:07:56.801 --> 01:07:57.634
<v Speaker 2>these are important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just for the person that's involved </v>

1609
01:07:59.861 --> 01:08:00.694
<v Speaker 2>in that situation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for everyone else observing because </v>

1610
01:08:02.891 --> 01:08:05.740
<v Speaker 2>we learn from each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't just learn by experience.</v>

1611
01:08:05.741 --> 01:08:08.140
<v Speaker 2>We learn from other people's experiences</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's very,</v>

1612
01:08:08.141 --> 01:08:12.480
<v Speaker 2>very important that way because we can </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience other people's lives just to,</v>

1613
01:08:12.670 --> 01:08:13.503
<v Speaker 2>through sheer communication as one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the most beautiful things about social </v>

1614
01:08:15.981 --> 01:08:16.814
<v Speaker 2>media is that we can all share much more</v>
<v Speaker 2>information than has ever been possible </v>

1615
01:08:20.721 --> 01:08:23.300
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And through that you can learn,</v>

1616
01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:25.640
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know who else was told that he would</v>

1617
01:08:25.641 --> 01:08:27.620
<v Speaker 2>never amount to be shit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jay Z,</v>

1618
01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:28.753
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know who else grew up in a shitty </v>

1619
01:08:29.631 --> 01:08:30.464
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know this fucking basketball player </v>

1620
01:08:32.241 --> 01:08:36.260
<v Speaker 2>or that MMA fighter or this standup </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedian or that artist.</v>

1621
01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:39.430
<v Speaker 2>There's a million examples of people who</v>
<v Speaker 2>will turn,</v>

1622
01:08:39.460 --> 01:08:41.270
<v Speaker 2>we'll told they're not going to be shit.</v>

1623
01:08:41.540 --> 01:08:42.373
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you are an exceptional dude in some </v>

1624
01:08:43.431 --> 01:08:45.260
<v Speaker 1>of the guys you mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're exceptional dudes.</v>

1625
01:08:45.261 --> 01:08:47.480
<v Speaker 1>Might I?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree with every word you said.</v>

1626
01:08:47.481 --> 01:08:48.314
<v Speaker 1>You are saying everything my parents </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever said to me and I listened and I </v>

1627
01:08:50.751 --> 01:08:53.540
<v Speaker 1>fucking did the war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My parents told me get a job.</v>

1628
01:08:54.140 --> 01:08:56.330
<v Speaker 1>That's what my parents did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They told me I wasn't funny.</v>

1629
01:08:56.630 --> 01:08:59.360
<v Speaker 1>They told me fighting is dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They told me all the wrong things.</v>

1630
01:08:59.361 --> 01:09:01.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My mom's still told the way a few months</v>

1631
01:09:01.610 --> 01:09:03.230
<v Speaker 1>ago that I should still open a law firm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

1632
01:09:03.231 --> 01:09:04.400
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's you're doing is funny.</v>

1633
01:09:04.401 --> 01:09:05.300
<v Speaker 1>It's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's okay,</v>

1634
01:09:05.301 --> 01:09:07.390
<v Speaker 1>but you should do something solid that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can count on it.</v>

1635
01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:11.030
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My mom still does not separate voyeurs.</v>

1636
01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:14.480
<v Speaker 1>They die of being tired and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>unhappy,</v>

1637
01:09:15.150 --> 01:09:15.983
<v Speaker 1>misery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exhausted and they just get coke and </v>

1638
01:09:17.661 --> 01:09:20.360
<v Speaker 1>hookers and shoot themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I go to the bathroom?</v>

1639
01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:22.700
<v Speaker 1>Go to the bathroom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good time.</v>

1640
01:09:22.701 --> 01:09:25.340
<v Speaker 1>Just something has hit the Internet that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1641
01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:28.310
<v Speaker 1>You need to show you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it may or may not be legit,</v>

1642
01:09:28.610 --> 01:09:32.870
<v Speaker 1>but then decided to retire young thanks </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the cheese catches later.</v>

1643
01:09:32.990 --> 01:09:35.480
<v Speaker 1>Conor mcgregor and he's trolling you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think so.</v>

1644
01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:36.373
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people have been </v>

1645
01:09:37.970 --> 01:09:40.270
<v Speaker 1>hitting me up telling me to show you and</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1646
01:09:40.670 --> 01:09:43.190
<v Speaker 1>no one knows what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I decided to retire young,</v>

1647
01:09:43.191 --> 01:09:46.890
<v Speaker 1>which means like 34 eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not today.</v>

1648
01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:48.353
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless he got fucking head kick today </v>

1649
01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:51.753
<v Speaker 2>and knocked into oblivion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea that he's going to go out on a </v>

1650
01:09:55.091 --> 01:09:58.540
<v Speaker 2>loss like that to nate Diaz Hook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got plenty of cash.</v>

1651
01:09:58.690 --> 01:10:02.680
<v Speaker 2>If he wanted to retire young and step </v>
<v Speaker 2>away,</v>

1652
01:10:03.310 --> 01:10:04.143
<v Speaker 2>I mean I guarantee you he probably made </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere in the neighborhood of 5 </v>

1653
01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:09.993
<v Speaker 2>million bucks with Josie Aldo fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He probably made more than that for the </v>

1654
01:10:13.330 --> 01:10:14.200
<v Speaker 2>Nate Diaz fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

1655
01:10:14.290 --> 01:10:16.660
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine after he spent a fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>load of Ed,</v>

1656
01:10:16.661 --> 01:10:18.670
<v Speaker 2>he's probably still got a few million </v>
<v Speaker 2>bucks laying around.</v>

1657
01:10:19.090 --> 01:10:21.880
<v Speaker 2>He's a hero in Ireland.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could always make money.</v>

1658
01:10:21.881 --> 01:10:25.780
<v Speaker 2>You can always run a gym and be fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if I had to guess,</v>

1659
01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:29.620
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only reason why it would make sense,</v>

1660
01:10:29.621 --> 01:10:30.454
<v Speaker 2>the only reason why it would make sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>as connor had actually thought about </v>

1661
01:10:33.551 --> 01:10:36.610
<v Speaker 2>retiring from mma before he got the call</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the UFC.</v>

1662
01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:41.020
<v Speaker 2>There was a point in time where he had </v>
<v Speaker 2>some friends that were experiencing some</v>

1663
01:10:41.021 --> 01:10:41.854
<v Speaker 2>serious health issues from fighting and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then most recently that young man from </v>

1664
01:10:47.531 --> 01:10:50.290
<v Speaker 2>the Portuguese guy died in an mma </v>
<v Speaker 2>contest,</v>

1665
01:10:50.291 --> 01:10:53.260
<v Speaker 2>which I think took place in the UK,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't</v>

1666
01:10:53.930 --> 01:10:54.763
<v Speaker 6>I know what he involved or related in </v>
<v Speaker 6>some way to one of those guys that just </v>

1667
01:10:57.801 --> 01:10:59.290
<v Speaker 6>died too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Didn't he know him or train with?</v>

1668
01:10:59.590 --> 01:11:00.423
<v Speaker 2>I think he trained with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Portuguese guy that just died </v>

1669
01:11:02.171 --> 01:11:05.080
<v Speaker 2>recently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is entirely possible in that sense,</v>

1670
01:11:05.081 --> 01:11:08.350
<v Speaker 2>but if I had to guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no way he'd do it like this.</v>

1671
01:11:08.351 --> 01:11:09.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1672
01:11:09.030 --> 01:11:09.863
<v Speaker 6>It also,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was talking with someone as this was </v>

1673
01:11:11.381 --> 01:11:12.330
<v Speaker 6>going on,</v>
<v Speaker 6>might not,</v>

1674
01:11:12.331 --> 01:11:14.040
<v Speaker 6>doesn't even seem like he usually talks </v>
<v Speaker 6>on</v>

1675
01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:16.740
<v Speaker 3>twitter sorta like I might,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he could have gotten hacked maybe,</v>

1676
01:11:16.980 --> 01:11:17.813
<v Speaker 3>but we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one really knows what's going on </v>

1677
01:11:18.811 --> 01:11:19.770
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

1678
01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:22.920
<v Speaker 3>That's if you've got hacked and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1679
01:11:22.921 --> 01:11:24.210
<v Speaker 3>That's all they're gonna do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1680
01:11:24.211 --> 01:11:26.820
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it hasn't been deleted yet and no</v>

1681
01:11:26.821 --> 01:11:30.420
<v Speaker 3>one else has really commented on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would call bullshit,</v>

1682
01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:34.380
<v Speaker 3>but you never know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just highly doubted.</v>

1683
01:11:34.530 --> 01:11:36.750
<v Speaker 3>Stay tuned folks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's trolling.</v>

1684
01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:38.033
<v Speaker 3>If I had to guess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd say he's trolling fucking around </v>

1685
01:11:39.370 --> 01:11:41.790
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he decided I'm going to retire young.</v>

1686
01:11:41.820 --> 01:11:44.250
<v Speaker 3>And then like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like one day or two days later,</v>

1687
01:11:44.251 --> 01:11:47.610
<v Speaker 3>which means around 34 you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's like 28 now.</v>

1688
01:11:48.270 --> 01:11:48.931
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's smart.</v>

1689
01:11:48.931 --> 01:11:49.764
<v Speaker 3>He will retire young.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just there's some dudes stay in it </v>

1690
01:11:52.531 --> 01:11:55.260
<v Speaker 3>way too long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They wind up with rattled domes.</v>

1691
01:11:55.750 --> 01:11:58.260
<v Speaker 3>She got to get out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel,</v>

1692
01:11:58.290 --> 01:11:59.160
<v Speaker 3>I feel slim from this.</v>

1693
01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:01.050
<v Speaker 3>Cogenic is already.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you feel better?</v>

1694
01:12:01.110 --> 01:12:02.730
<v Speaker 3>It felt good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Checked out,</v>

1695
01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:04.470
<v Speaker 3>checked out the keg in the bathroom was </v>
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

1696
01:12:05.030 --> 01:12:07.230
<v Speaker 3>It's like a pony keg now what do you </v>
<v Speaker 3>try?</v>

1697
01:12:07.260 --> 01:12:10.470
<v Speaker 3>Do you have a target weight you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to get to or a body fat number?</v>

1698
01:12:10.790 --> 01:12:11.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want it.</v>

1699
01:12:11.370 --> 01:12:16.370
<v Speaker 3>I want to get to like 15 16% body fat 22</v>
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>

1700
01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:21.240
<v Speaker 3>2123 so you don't have lofty goals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have reasonable goals.</v>

1701
01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:22.133
<v Speaker 3>Reasonable goals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not trying to be like shredded and </v>

1702
01:12:23.431 --> 01:12:24.270
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why not?</v>

1703
01:12:24.910 --> 01:12:27.600
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kind of liked being a dancing bear.</v>

1704
01:12:27.810 --> 01:12:32.070
<v Speaker 3>Do you like it or is it like your 19 </v>
<v Speaker 3>year old friend that was like,</v>

1705
01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:34.290
<v Speaker 3>you don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no hope for me now.</v>

1706
01:12:34.291 --> 01:12:35.910
<v Speaker 3>I can never get shredded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just need,</v>

1707
01:12:35.911 --> 01:12:37.860
<v Speaker 3>I just need to be a little bit better at</v>
<v Speaker 3>basketball.</v>

1708
01:12:37.890 --> 01:12:38.870
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

1709
01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:39.810
<v Speaker 3>That's don't want to be shredded.</v>

1710
01:12:39.810 --> 01:12:41.550
<v Speaker 3>Like if somebody gives you a pill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say Eddie,</v>

1711
01:12:41.610 --> 01:12:44.610
<v Speaker 3>I have a pill right now with no health </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequences whatsoever.</v>

1712
01:12:44.611 --> 01:12:49.140
<v Speaker 3>I can give you this pill and you will be</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking Lebron James Shredded.</v>

1713
01:12:49.170 --> 01:12:50.003
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think part of my identity is being </v>

1714
01:12:51.271 --> 01:12:52.104
<v Speaker 3>slightly chubby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Part of your identity has become more </v>

1715
01:12:54.391 --> 01:12:55.740
<v Speaker 3>chubby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm beyond,</v>

1716
01:12:56.070 --> 01:12:58.810
<v Speaker 3>I'm prediabetic so I need to just watch </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1717
01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:03.170
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it's some years or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Six months ago to Dr I'm prediabetic and</v>

1718
01:13:03.171 --> 01:13:06.300
<v Speaker 3>another time for now you're pre diabetic</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're still eating candy at night.</v>

1719
01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:09.930
<v Speaker 3>18 months ago I went to the doctor and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were like,</v>

1720
01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:12.240
<v Speaker 3>you're in the prediabetic zone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I got out of it,</v>

1721
01:13:12.241 --> 01:13:13.074
<v Speaker 3>which was good but it's like I have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>watch it cause I'm kind of on the line </v>

1722
01:13:15.630 --> 01:13:17.250
<v Speaker 3>and yet you're still eating candy late </v>
<v Speaker 3>at night.</v>

1723
01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:18.540
<v Speaker 3>The fuck is wrong with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kind of.</v>

1724
01:13:18.541 --> 01:13:19.560
<v Speaker 3>No self control man.</v>

1725
01:13:19.830 --> 01:13:20.663
<v Speaker 3>But then you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're thinking everybody should get 30 </v>

1726
01:13:21.541 --> 01:13:22.374
<v Speaker 3>grand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you understand like discipline is an </v>

1727
01:13:23.731 --> 01:13:25.740
<v Speaker 3>important part of life?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you understand this?</v>

1728
01:13:26.190 --> 01:13:27.990
<v Speaker 3>This is very important.</v>

<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1731
01:13:31.590 --> 01:13:32.930
<v Speaker 3>I got to work on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just got to,</v>

1732
01:13:33.030 --> 01:13:33.863
<v Speaker 3>do you write things down?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you write things down that you have </v>

1733
01:13:36.211 --> 01:13:37.060
<v Speaker 3>to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1734
01:13:37.260 --> 01:13:39.690
<v Speaker 3>Do you write things down that you just </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't do anymore like this?</v>

1735
01:13:39.691 --> 01:13:41.250
<v Speaker 3>I won't do this anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not,</v>

1736
01:13:41.310 --> 01:13:42.840
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not on the menu anymore.</v>

1737
01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:45.150
<v Speaker 3>To do that and then sometimes I still </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking do them.</v>

1738
01:13:45.180 --> 01:13:46.170
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't do that.</v>

1739
01:13:46.510 --> 01:13:47.343
<v Speaker 3>I get to write things down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's against the point of writing it </v>

1740
01:13:49.411 --> 01:13:50.190
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>just getting to give yourself a certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>amount.</v>

1742
01:13:51.961 --> 01:13:53.430
<v Speaker 3>Like here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's a good example.</v>

1743
01:13:53.610 --> 01:13:55.050
<v Speaker 3>Give yourself 60 days.</v>

1744
01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:59.160
<v Speaker 3>Say for 60 days I'm going to go on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>diet where I don't eat any bread.</v>

1745
01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:01.980
<v Speaker 3>I don't take in any pasta.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have any rice.</v>

1746
01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:06.150
<v Speaker 3>I only eat healthy foods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything is healthy or I don't eat it.</v>

1747
01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:07.920
<v Speaker 3>It's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The rice just to kill her man.</v>

1748
01:14:08.490 --> 01:14:09.870
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rice is a lot of carbs,</v>

1749
01:14:09.871 --> 01:14:10.704
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's it directly in your body to </v>

1750
01:14:12.191 --> 01:14:15.460
<v Speaker 3>sugar and it'll also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like it's inflammatory,</v>

1751
01:14:15.461 --> 01:14:18.400
<v Speaker 3>like it causes inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whole 30 thing.</v>

1752
01:14:18.401 --> 01:14:21.960
<v Speaker 3>Somebody told me about the whole exam.</v>

<v Speaker 3>shit?</v>

<v Speaker 3>I just eat whole foods always now,</v>

1757
01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:33.153
<v Speaker 3>but I've been doing it for I t I got on </v>
<v Speaker 3>his primal blueprint diet about three </v>

<v Speaker 3>give myself two months,</v>

1759
01:14:40.180 --> 01:14:41.560
<v Speaker 3>but after the two months we're over.</v>

1760
01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:43.500
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is amit now this,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1763
01:14:46.540 --> 01:14:48.520
<v Speaker 3>I don't get crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But occasionally I do.</v>

1764
01:14:48.850 --> 01:14:51.550
<v Speaker 3>I believe everything in moderation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>including moderation.</v>

1765
01:14:52.150 --> 01:14:52.983
<v Speaker 3>So if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're out and you get your freak on </v>

1766

<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

1767
01:14:56.351 --> 01:14:57.790

<v Speaker 3>let's do this.</v>

1768
01:14:58.030 --> 01:14:59.740
<v Speaker 3>Get in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you don't do it all the time.</v>

1769
01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:03.010
<v Speaker 3>Every now and then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I understand the consequences.</v>

1770
01:15:03.011 --> 01:15:05.020
<v Speaker 3>You will get wrecked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1771
01:15:05.050 --> 01:15:08.260
<v Speaker 3>But also Chow Maine on a curb like three</v>
<v Speaker 3>weeks ago,</v>

1772
01:15:08.261 --> 01:15:09.700
<v Speaker 3>that wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that wasn't awesome.</v>

1773
01:15:09.830 --> 01:15:11.040
<v Speaker 3>Let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Drinking,</v>

1774
01:15:11.180 --> 01:15:12.590
<v Speaker 3>drinking,</v>

01:15:12.610 --> 01:15:14.740
<v Speaker 3>booze is bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the feeling is great.</v>

1776
01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:15.753
<v Speaker 3>I think there's some amazing things that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are accomplished when you're under the </v>

1777
01:15:17.951 --> 01:15:20.760
<v Speaker 3>influence and incredible things get </v>
<v Speaker 3>accomplished.</v>

1778
01:15:20.761 --> 01:15:24.430
<v Speaker 3>I puked shall remain on a curb,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as far as like social things,</v>

1779
01:15:24.431 --> 01:15:27.400
<v Speaker 3>you have real great fun with your </v>
<v Speaker 3>friends that you'll never forget.</v>

1780
01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:30.580
<v Speaker 3>There's there's moments of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

1781
01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:31.433
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

1782
01:15:31.630 --> 01:15:32.463
<v Speaker 3>there's moments during alcohol </v>
<v Speaker 3>intoxication where you kind of see </v>

1783
01:15:37.631 --> 01:15:42.460
<v Speaker 3>things from what they are cause the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the veil that's in front of your mind,</v>

1784
01:15:42.730 --> 01:15:43.563
<v Speaker 3>the veil of inhibition and struggle and </v>
<v Speaker 3>bullshit and insecurity is removed by </v>

1785
01:15:48.371 --> 01:15:49.900
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alcohol for the most part,</v>

1786
01:15:49.901 --> 01:15:50.734
<v Speaker 3>alcohol makes people a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it makes a lot of people assholes </v>

1787
01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:54.273
<v Speaker 3>because?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because they lose their inhibitions </v>

1788
01:15:56.111 --> 01:15:59.320
<v Speaker 3>because they get cocky because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have fear anymore.</v>

1789
01:15:59.321 --> 01:16:00.030
<v Speaker 3>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1790
01:16:00.030 --> 01:16:00.863
<v Speaker 3>it distorts reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you get more social or antisocial </v>

1791
01:16:03.911 --> 01:16:04.900
<v Speaker 3>when you joined?</v>
<v Speaker 3>More social.</v>

1792

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>me too.</v>

1793
01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:07.090
<v Speaker 3>I get more social.</v>

1794
01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:10.480
<v Speaker 3>nice people to become more nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when someone's an asshole,</v>

1795
01:16:10.481 --> 01:16:12.880
<v Speaker 3>when they're drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I usually find it's incredibly revealing</v>

1796
01:16:12.881 --> 01:16:15.310
<v Speaker 3>of who they're trying not to be when </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're sober.</v>

1797
01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:16.313
<v Speaker 3>Like what they're hiding from you when </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're sober and usually is like </v>

1798
01:16:18.790 --> 01:16:20.890
<v Speaker 3>revealing of the demons inside of them.</v>

<v Speaker 3>incredible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bro.</v>

1829
01:17:15.700 --> 01:17:18.890
<v Speaker 3>Just break a records of the bedroom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew some people that had been in some</v>

1830
01:17:18.891 --> 01:17:21.440
<v Speaker 3>trouble and I learned from other </v>
<v Speaker 3>people's experiences.</v>

1831
01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:23.270
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never been a fan of drunks,</v>

1832
01:17:23.390 --> 01:17:25.940
<v Speaker 3>especially girls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just feel like when you,</v>

1833
01:17:25.941 --> 01:17:27.740
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're a date with someone,</v>

1834
01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:30.870
<v Speaker 3>if you dated drug addict or you did an </v>
<v Speaker 3>alcoholic or something like that,</v>

1835
01:17:30.871 --> 01:17:31.704
<v Speaker 3>and man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the burden of just getting to know </v>

1836
01:17:32.871 --> 01:17:34.780
<v Speaker 3>someone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>enjoying their company and,</v>

1837
01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:38.120
<v Speaker 3>and being even with each other and </v>
<v Speaker 3>enjoying each other's company,</v>

1838
01:17:38.140 --> 01:17:40.400
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard enough to figure out if you're</v>

1839
01:17:40.401 --> 01:17:44.900
<v Speaker 3>compatible with someone socially without</v>
<v Speaker 3>this monkey on their back.</v>

1840
01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:45.753
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone's got a heroin problem and </v>

1841
01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:48.860

<v Speaker 3>heroin problem.</v>

1842
01:17:48.980 --> 01:17:50.780
<v Speaker 3>Like I have a buddy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my buddy Brian Cowen,</v>

1843
01:17:51.590 --> 01:17:53.780

<v Speaker 3>but he always used to try to clean these</v>

1844
01:17:53.781 --> 01:17:55.550
<v Speaker 3>girls up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's tried to take him in.</v>

1845
01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:58.370
<v Speaker 3>He was the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was the worst.</v>

1846
01:17:58.371 --> 01:17:59.204
<v Speaker 3>I used to tell him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like get out now and he wouldn't do </v>

1847
01:18:01.311 --> 01:18:02.160
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then two years later,</v>

<v Speaker 3>so was he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

<v Speaker 3>You should have listened to me again her</v>

1850
01:18:06.790 --> 01:18:07.623
<v Speaker 3>fucking a decade.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to tell this guy dating a heroin </v>

1851
01:18:11.751 --> 01:18:14.270
<v Speaker 3>addict or not dating a heroin addict and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll go with the no,</v>

1852
01:18:14.700 --> 01:18:15.533
<v Speaker 3>it's a good move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1853
01:18:15.590 --> 01:18:16.760
<v Speaker 3>But some guys are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1854

<v Speaker 3>friend and you know,</v>

1855
01:18:19.341 --> 01:18:20.770
<v Speaker 3>once it cleaned up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean she's,</v>

1856

<v Speaker 3>well I'll make mistakes that are into </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1857
01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:25.100
<v Speaker 3>They're into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's also,</v>

1858
01:18:25.790 --> 01:18:28.130
<v Speaker 3>here's the reality of captain save a </v>
<v Speaker 3>hose.</v>

1859
01:18:28.460 --> 01:18:31.460
<v Speaker 3>When you find someone's problems are </v>
<v Speaker 3>greater than your own,</v>

1860
01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:34.040
<v Speaker 3>it lets you concentrate on things other </v>
<v Speaker 3>than your problems,</v>

1861
01:18:34.041 --> 01:18:37.760
<v Speaker 3>which you are not fixing the voice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are a lazy fuck.</v>

1862
01:18:38.210 --> 01:18:39.043
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you procrastinate and people find </v>

1863
01:18:40.460 --> 01:18:41.293
<v Speaker 3>really strange ways to procrastinate and</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the ways they find it to </v>

1864
01:18:43.910 --> 01:18:44.743
<v Speaker 3>procrastinate is to create other </v>
<v Speaker 3>problems in their life that take </v>

1865
01:18:47.091 --> 01:18:49.160
<v Speaker 3>precedent over the problem that they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>avoiding.</v>

1866
01:18:50.210 --> 01:18:51.650
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

<v Speaker 3>This is the funny thing.</v>

1868
01:18:54.020 --> 01:18:55.880
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you on all the personal </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

1869
01:18:55.881 --> 01:18:58.690
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why my personal views don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>translate to my world views.</v>

1870
01:18:58.700 --> 01:19:01.030
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a lot of story thousand bucks.</v>

1871
01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:01.873

<v Speaker 3>I am with like people and my brothers </v>

1872

<v Speaker 3>hour.</v>

<v Speaker 3>businesses.</v>

1881
01:19:24.111 --> 01:19:24.710
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>slavery.</v>

1883
01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:29.090
<v Speaker 3>It's the same shit they said about </v>
<v Speaker 3>slavery,</v>

1884
01:19:29.091 --> 01:19:31.400
<v Speaker 3>abolished slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These plantations is going to go under.</v>

1885
01:19:31.610 --> 01:19:32.540
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>guess what?</v>

1886
01:19:32.541 --> 01:19:33.374
<v Speaker 3>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't just have people work all day </v>

1887
01:19:35.511 --> 01:19:37.370
<v Speaker 3>for you and not give them any fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>

1888
01:19:37.810 --> 01:19:39.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have to be able to make a living.</v>

1889
01:19:39.590 --> 01:19:40.423
<v Speaker 3>And if your business does not make </v>
<v Speaker 3>enough money to give someone a living </v>

1890
01:19:43.731 --> 01:19:45.980
<v Speaker 3>wage to work all week for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then guess what?</v>

1891
01:19:46.010 --> 01:19:48.800
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to fast forward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't afford to have an employee,</v>

1892
01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:51.200
<v Speaker 3>so you have to figure out a way to </v>
<v Speaker 3>either make more money.</v>

1893
01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:52.153
<v Speaker 3>You have to figure out a way to get a </v>
<v Speaker 3>better business or operate with less </v>

1894
01:19:54.291 --> 01:19:55.130
<v Speaker 3>employees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1895
01:19:55.290 --> 01:19:56.123
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only thing that they have to do is </v>

1896
01:19:57.921 --> 01:19:58.754
<v Speaker 3>they have the help subsidize a small </v>
<v Speaker 3>midsize businesses to compete with like </v>

1897
01:20:01.371 --> 01:20:03.350
<v Speaker 3>the walmarts and the best buys and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>target.</v>

1898
01:20:03.351 --> 01:20:04.184
<v Speaker 3>Subsidize how tax incentives and things </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that to the small midsize </v>

1899
01:20:08.550 --> 01:20:11.520
<v Speaker 3>businesses because to absorb this new </v>
<v Speaker 3>salaries right now,</v>

1900
01:20:11.521 --> 01:20:15.450
<v Speaker 3>immediately the big companies have a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>more of a cushion in a margin to absorb,</v>

1901
01:20:15.451 --> 01:20:17.150
<v Speaker 3>absorb this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I'm saying,</v>

1902
01:20:17.460 --> 01:20:19.770
<v Speaker 3>the small mid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to start adjusting your,</v>

1903
01:20:19.860 --> 01:20:23.400
<v Speaker 3>the way you do in business,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the prices,</v>

1904
01:20:23.430 --> 01:20:24.263
<v Speaker 3>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to move some pieces around so I </v>

1905
01:20:26.641 --> 01:20:27.710
<v Speaker 3>can fix all this shit.</v>

1906
01:20:27.970 --> 01:20:29.700
<v Speaker 3>How quick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Legalize weed.</v>

1907
01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:32.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Legalize weed worldwide.</v>

1908
01:20:32.580 --> 01:20:33.413
<v Speaker 3>Everybody would just so we'd know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Any people who are having a job right </v>

1909
01:20:36.121 --> 01:20:38.220
<v Speaker 3>now would make a lot of money just </v>
<v Speaker 3>selling weed.</v>

1910
01:20:39.330 --> 01:20:40.163
<v Speaker 3>They would go to Colorado right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know real estate Colorado's up like </v>

1911
01:20:43.291 --> 01:20:47.230
<v Speaker 3>19% but you know what's going to happen?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bleed.</v>

1912
01:20:47.430 --> 01:20:50.420
<v Speaker 3>It's not going to be like your neighbor </v>
<v Speaker 3>or the guy downstairs halloween.</v>

1913
01:20:50.570 --> 01:20:53.400
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be big companies and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be these kids.</v>

1914
01:20:53.580 --> 01:20:54.660
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm all for legal.</v>

1915
01:20:54.670 --> 01:20:57.000
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't say I want to leave us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They already are.</v>

1916
01:20:57.001 --> 01:21:00.630
<v Speaker 3>These people are buying up the rights in</v>
<v Speaker 3>certain states to be the distributors.</v>

1917
01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:02.970
<v Speaker 3>That's what those are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>State laws.</v>

1918
01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:05.940
<v Speaker 3>You can't have those state laws.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are buying up the rights laws.</v>

1919
01:21:05.941 --> 01:21:07.680
<v Speaker 3>That's what they were trying to pass in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Ohio,</v>

1920
01:21:07.681 --> 01:21:08.514
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie and everybody rightfully said no </v>

1921
01:21:10.201 --> 01:21:12.660
<v Speaker 3>to it because this was going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>monopoly situation.</v>

1922
01:21:12.690 --> 01:21:14.070
<v Speaker 3>They were going to just be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's legal.</v>

1923
01:21:14.071 --> 01:21:15.030
<v Speaker 3>Go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go crazy,</v>

1924
01:21:15.290 --> 01:21:17.460
<v Speaker 3>go sell it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sell it like a half baked.</v>

1925
01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:21.240
<v Speaker 3>You know what's going on in Colorado is </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's changing the economy.</v>

1926
01:21:21.630 --> 01:21:23.460
<v Speaker 3>Colorado,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

1927
01:21:23.461 --> 01:21:25.620
<v Speaker 3>they made more money from taxes this </v>
<v Speaker 3>year.</v>

1928
01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:29.010
<v Speaker 3>For the first time ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then they did from alcohol with weed,</v>

1929
01:21:29.220 --> 01:21:30.990
<v Speaker 3>more money from weed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then with alcohol,</v>

1930
01:21:30.991 --> 01:21:31.824
<v Speaker 3>which is just fucking bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they charged 39% the 39% taxes on </v>

1931
01:21:36.361 --> 01:21:37.500
<v Speaker 3>weed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And everybody's like,</v>

1932
01:21:37.501 --> 01:21:39.080
<v Speaker 3>who cares?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who Cares?</v>

1933
01:21:39.081 --> 01:21:39.914
<v Speaker 3>Salad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's still cheaper than alcohol and </v>

1934
01:21:41.671 --> 01:21:43.860
<v Speaker 3>we'll pay it and it's better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1935
01:21:43.890 --> 01:21:47.700
<v Speaker 3>So like something like that could change</v>
<v Speaker 3>and also look,</v>

1936
01:21:47.701 --> 01:21:48.534
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't infantilize this entire </v>

1937
01:21:50.731 --> 01:21:51.564
<v Speaker 3>country like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't tell people what they can and </v>

1938
01:21:53.011 --> 01:21:54.570
<v Speaker 3>can't do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just can't do it.</v>

1939
01:21:54.630 --> 01:21:57.440
<v Speaker 3>And it's a gigantic part to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway.</v>

1940
01:21:57.470 --> 01:21:58.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean all these,</v>

1941
01:21:58.380 --> 01:21:59.213
<v Speaker 3>these restrictions on behavior and what </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can and can't do or a gigantic part </v>

1942
01:22:03.271 --> 01:22:07.290
<v Speaker 3>of the problem with the fiber of our </v>
<v Speaker 3>economy and the fiber of our culture.</v>

1943
01:22:07.500 --> 01:22:08.333
<v Speaker 3>We've got all these weird restrictions </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are in place that are archaic and </v>

1944
01:22:10.441 --> 01:22:13.680
<v Speaker 3>don't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you accept one thing,</v>

1945
01:22:13.681 --> 01:22:14.514
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well then it leaves room for a lot of </v>

1946
01:22:16.711 --> 01:22:20.490
<v Speaker 3>other weird shenanigans like Ted Cruz </v>
<v Speaker 3>wanting to lock people up for Dildos.</v>

1947
01:22:20.670 --> 01:22:21.850
<v Speaker 3>You know about all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1948
01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:22.793
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this dumb motherfuckers really close to </v>

1949
01:22:24.691 --> 01:22:25.524
<v Speaker 3>being president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ted Cruz was trying to pass a law that </v>

1950
01:22:28.561 --> 01:22:31.380
<v Speaker 3>would put you in jail for having dildos </v>
<v Speaker 3>pull.</v>

1951
01:22:31.381 --> 01:22:32.280
<v Speaker 3>Pull this up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>

1952
01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:33.233
<v Speaker 3>because this is just one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>hilarious things about this dumb ass </v>

1953
01:22:35.970 --> 01:22:36.803
<v Speaker 3>that people were trying to force down </v>
<v Speaker 3>the American public's face because the </v>

1954
01:22:39.001 --> 01:22:41.910
<v Speaker 3>Republican candidates are all at joke </v>
<v Speaker 3>other than Donald Trump.</v>

1955
01:22:42.210 --> 01:22:44.400
<v Speaker 3>No one could get past that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's a joke.</v>

1956
01:22:44.710 --> 01:22:45.211
<v Speaker 3>No one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one.</v>

1957
01:22:45.211 --> 01:22:47.580
<v Speaker 3>You can get past that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the Republicans are panicking.</v>

1958
01:22:48.340 --> 01:22:49.200
<v Speaker 3>They don't know what to do.</v>

1959
01:22:49.380 --> 01:22:50.213
<v Speaker 3>So they put this fucking Ted Cruz dummy </v>
<v Speaker 3>in not knowing there's a million </v>

1960
01:22:53.041 --> 01:22:54.660
<v Speaker 3>different things that are wrong with </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

1961
01:22:54.910 --> 01:22:57.810
<v Speaker 3>The time Ted Cruz defended a ban on </v>
<v Speaker 3>Dildos,</v>

1962
01:22:57.811 --> 01:23:01.860
<v Speaker 3>his legal team argued that there was no </v>
<v Speaker 3>right to stimulate one's genitals.</v>

1970

1972
01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:33.730
<v Speaker 3>battle concerning privacy and free </v>
<v Speaker 3>speech,</v>

1973
01:23:33.731 --> 01:23:34.564
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>2004 companies that owned Austin stores </v>

1974
01:23:35.951 --> 01:23:36.784
<v Speaker 3>selling texts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sex toys and a retail distributor of </v>

1975
01:23:38.861 --> 01:23:39.694
<v Speaker 3>such products challenged Texas law </v>
<v Speaker 3>outlawing the sale and promotion of </v>

1976
01:23:42.881 --> 01:23:45.730
<v Speaker 3>supposedly obscene devices and will were</v>
<v Speaker 3>put,</v>

1977
01:23:45.731 --> 01:23:48.420
<v Speaker 3>put the thing where he wanted to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>how much it,</v>

1978
01:23:48.460 --> 01:23:50.800
<v Speaker 3>you should go to jail for it cause it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was like two years.</v>

1979
01:23:51.130 --> 01:23:53.560
<v Speaker 3>Here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1980
01:23:54.140 --> 01:23:54.973
<v Speaker 3>under the law,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a person who violated the statute could </v>

1981
01:23:57.281 --> 01:24:01.330
<v Speaker 3>go to jail for up to two years for </v>
<v Speaker 3>selling dildos.</v>

1982
01:24:01.510 --> 01:24:02.343
<v Speaker 3>And this dummy supported that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is that this is a women's rights </v>

1983
01:24:06.011 --> 01:24:09.460
<v Speaker 3>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Real women's rights issue for Dildos for</v>

1984
01:24:09.461 --> 01:24:11.590
<v Speaker 3>dudes to be sexist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying no,</v>

1985
01:24:11.830 --> 01:24:12.663
<v Speaker 3>but I'm saying I hope this is one thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that women and men can all come </v>

1986
01:24:14.771 --> 01:24:16.180
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dildos.</v>

1987
01:24:16.990 --> 01:24:17.823
<v Speaker 3>So important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the most hilarious thing because </v>

1988
01:24:19.421 --> 01:24:21.100
<v Speaker 3>Dick's are available for anybody who </v>
<v Speaker 3>needs them.</v>

1989
01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:23.710
<v Speaker 3>All you have to do is raise your hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>step outside of your house when you go,</v>

1990
01:24:23.711 --> 01:24:24.544
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking for some deck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a sign on the side of the road </v>

<v Speaker 3>there's people that stop and like red </v>

1994
01:24:31.361 --> 01:24:34.120
<v Speaker 3>lights and they have signs for change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even that works.</v>

1995
01:24:34.180 --> 01:24:36.040
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People will give you what you need,</v>

1996
01:24:36.250 --> 01:24:37.083
<v Speaker 3>but if you have a sign that says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking for Dick and reasonably </v>

1997
01:24:40.930 --> 01:24:42.820
<v Speaker 3>clean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone's gotta fuck you.</v>

1998
01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:44.920
<v Speaker 3>Someone had some old pull up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1999

<v Speaker 3>Anywhere,</v>

2000
01:24:45.910 --> 01:24:48.400
<v Speaker 3>any corner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But people have the right,</v>

2001
01:24:48.460 --> 01:24:49.293
<v Speaker 3>the rural right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have the right to want a dick </v>

2002
01:24:51.251 --> 01:24:53.140
<v Speaker 3>without a body attached to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2003
01:24:53.340 --> 01:24:53.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2004
01:24:53.770 --> 01:24:57.010
<v Speaker 3>Dick without a relationship or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or opinions or even a pulse.</v>

2005
01:24:57.011 --> 01:24:57.844
<v Speaker 3>Anything to say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We want to Dixon Suneemon that off made </v>

2006
01:24:59.071 --> 01:25:01.420
<v Speaker 3>out of human tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want a rubber one?</v>

2007
01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:02.913
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

2008
01:25:03.130 --> 01:25:04.400
<v Speaker 3>what's this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fill this hole up.</v>

2009
01:25:04.410 --> 01:25:06.290
<v Speaker 3>Hard body get done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's key.</v>

2010
01:25:06.291 --> 01:25:08.680
<v Speaker 3>It's just get it done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I don't know how I got to that,</v>

2011
01:25:08.681 --> 01:25:09.514
<v Speaker 3>but our leadership as a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a joke because you can't expect a </v>

2012
01:25:13.901 --> 01:25:14.734
<v Speaker 3>person to want anybody that wants to run</v>
<v Speaker 3>this entire country has got to be a </v>

2013
01:25:18.041 --> 01:25:18.874
<v Speaker 3>crazy person.</v>

2014
01:25:19.150 --> 01:25:19.983
<v Speaker 3>You have to be a nut and it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really shouldn't have one president </v>

2015
01:25:22.391 --> 01:25:23.224
<v Speaker 3>anyway because the idea is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So one person's going to be involved in </v>

2016
01:25:26.381 --> 01:25:28.300
<v Speaker 3>the all the decisions for the entire </v>
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>

2017
01:25:28.301 --> 01:25:32.050
<v Speaker 3>That's preposterous thing too is people </v>
<v Speaker 3>only pay attention like the presidential</v>

2018
01:25:32.051 --> 01:25:33.880
<v Speaker 3>race when all of these other things are </v>
<v Speaker 3>going on.</v>

2019
01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:35.033
<v Speaker 3>National Senate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things like it's hard to fucking keep </v>

2020
01:25:36.191 --> 01:25:37.780
<v Speaker 3>track of though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're all fucking clowns.</v>

2021
01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:39.490
<v Speaker 3>It's impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said it's impossible.</v>

2022
01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:40.353
<v Speaker 3>I don't trust any of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what's really fucked up as this is </v>

2023
01:25:41.831 --> 01:25:42.664
<v Speaker 3>like the best bot in the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like all the other spots wa all the </v>

2024
01:25:45.790 --> 01:25:49.120
<v Speaker 3>different goofballs all over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you see what's going on in Brazil.</v>

2025
01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:50.433
<v Speaker 3>Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're impeaching their fucking </v>

2026
01:25:50.921 --> 01:25:52.690
<v Speaker 3>president right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Panama papers,</v>

2027
01:25:52.691 --> 01:25:54.310
<v Speaker 3>shit is crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy,</v>

2028
01:25:55.240 --> 01:25:56.790
<v Speaker 3>crazy loving it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tell it,</v>

2029
01:25:56.791 --> 01:25:58.330
<v Speaker 3>tell people about if they don't know </v>
<v Speaker 3>what it is.</v>

2030
01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:01.240
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Panama papers is because this is not</v>

2031
01:26:01.241 --> 01:26:03.350
<v Speaker 3>getting discussed in the news hardly at </v>
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>

2032
01:26:03.620 --> 01:26:04.340
<v Speaker 3>It's some</v>

2033
01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:07.280
<v Speaker 1>not enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's basically people,</v>

2034
01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:11.090
<v Speaker 1>leaders of of countries like the British</v>
<v Speaker 1>Prime Ministers,</v>

2035
01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:13.700
<v Speaker 1>dad and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brazil,</v>

2036
01:26:13.701 --> 01:26:15.290
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Guy Brazil's involved.</v>

2037
01:26:15.650 --> 01:26:18.380
<v Speaker 1>But there's a people leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>presidents,</v>

2038
01:26:18.381 --> 01:26:22.250
<v Speaker 1>prime ministers have been keeping their </v>
<v Speaker 1>money in offshore accounts,</v>

2039
01:26:22.370 --> 01:26:27.020
<v Speaker 1>not paying the taxes that they owe in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their country and keeping this money off</v>

2040
01:26:27.021 --> 01:26:27.854
<v Speaker 1>the books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then somebody gave this information </v>

2041
01:26:30.111 --> 01:26:30.944
<v Speaker 1>from a law firm that does most of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>transactions and it's now being </v>

2042
01:26:34.731 --> 01:26:37.820
<v Speaker 1>published.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all the money's being hidden.</v>

2043
01:26:37.850 --> 01:26:38.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>An influence.</v>

2044
01:26:38.991 --> 01:26:42.430
<v Speaker 1>And it highlights how people are getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>influenced to make certain decisions and</v>

2045
01:26:42.650 --> 01:26:46.550
<v Speaker 1>how much briberies taking place and how </v>
<v Speaker 1>does only apply to certain people.</v>

2046
01:26:46.850 --> 01:26:51.740
<v Speaker 1>They don't apply to the people making </v>
<v Speaker 1>the laws off shit.</v>

2047
01:26:51.770 --> 01:26:54.820
<v Speaker 1>It's shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the best way to fix this is what give</v>

2048
01:26:54.821 --> 01:26:55.790
<v Speaker 1>people $30,000.</v>

2049
01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:02.270
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just going to keep people poor.</v>

2050
01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:04.490
<v Speaker 1>That'd be the best way to keep people </v>
<v Speaker 1>from competing with you.</v>

2051
01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:05.840
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give Him,</v>

2117
01:29:48.270 --> 01:29:50.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad people are looking at it that </v>
<v Speaker 1>way though,</v>

2118
01:29:50.521 --> 01:29:51.354
<v Speaker 1>that they have ostracized him instead of</v>
<v Speaker 1>like concentrating only on the guy who </v>

2119
01:29:54.871 --> 01:29:56.700
<v Speaker 1>was banging other girls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2120
01:29:56.730 --> 01:29:57.870
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

2121
01:29:57.900 --> 01:29:58.630
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

2122
01:29:58.630 --> 01:29:59.670
<v Speaker 1>That you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

2123
01:29:59.671 --> 01:30:00.504
<v Speaker 1>The priorities are totally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely solid priorities in that </v>

2124
01:30:03.661 --> 01:30:06.690
<v Speaker 1>case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>regardless of whether or not the guy who</v>

2125
01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:09.480
<v Speaker 1>did the deed shouldn't have done it or </v>
<v Speaker 1>should have done it,</v>

2126
01:30:09.481 --> 01:30:11.240
<v Speaker 1>like whatever your opinions are about </v>
<v Speaker 1>changing,</v>

2127
01:30:11.870 --> 01:30:12.703
<v Speaker 1>that guy is violating a friendship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that guy didn't tell him that </v>

2128
01:30:15.301 --> 01:30:16.134
<v Speaker 1>because he wanted the world to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He told them that because they're </v>

2129
01:30:17.731 --> 01:30:18.564
<v Speaker 1>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have friends that tell me dark shit </v>

2130
01:30:19.741 --> 01:30:22.770
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do when we laugh like pigs and I'll</v>

2131
01:30:22.771 --> 01:30:23.604
<v Speaker 1>never tell a soul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll go to my grave with all that </v>

2132
01:30:24.991 --> 01:30:27.060
<v Speaker 1>knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what a friend supposed to be.</v>

2133
01:30:27.570 --> 01:30:29.190
<v Speaker 1>Any guy who would do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a piece of shit.</v>

2134
01:30:29.190 --> 01:30:30.023
<v Speaker 1>So I'm glad that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rules and principles of friendship </v>

2135
01:30:32.730 --> 01:30:35.310
<v Speaker 1>have overtaken the rules and principles </v>
<v Speaker 1>of monogamy.</v>

2136
01:30:35.370 --> 01:30:36.540
<v Speaker 1>Loyalty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2137
01:30:36.570 --> 01:30:40.500
<v Speaker 1>Tell me over to the people over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people you sleep with.</v>

2138
01:30:40.950 --> 01:30:41.783
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was interesting though because that </v>

2139
01:30:42.511 --> 01:30:44.100
<v Speaker 1>same week it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2140
01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:47.130
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this girl Kalani had supposedly,</v>

2141
01:30:47.131 --> 01:30:51.510
<v Speaker 1>people had assumed she had cheated on </v>
<v Speaker 1>her boyfriend who was in the NBA,</v>

2142
01:30:51.511 --> 01:30:52.560
<v Speaker 1>Kyrie Irving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2143
01:30:52.740 --> 01:30:55.170
<v Speaker 1>So then it's the Angela thing happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when it was the girl,</v>

2144
01:30:55.440 --> 01:30:59.040
<v Speaker 1>everyone beat her up over cheating or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever and she actually didn't,</v>

2145
01:30:59.460 --> 01:31:02.550
<v Speaker 1>she didn't even cheat with the Di Angelo</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nick young thing.</v>

2146
01:31:02.580 --> 01:31:05.310
<v Speaker 1>Everyone was just mad at the Angela,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which de Angelo deserves.</v>

2147
01:31:05.430 --> 01:31:08.280
<v Speaker 1>He's the worst person in that week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then also I was like,</v>

2148
01:31:08.281 --> 01:31:09.870
<v Speaker 1>well if you're going to be mad at </v>
<v Speaker 1>Killarney,</v>

2149
01:31:09.871 --> 01:31:12.420
<v Speaker 1>then you gotta be mad at Nikki on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which just don't be mad at either one of</v>

2150
01:31:12.421 --> 01:31:12.540
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

2151
01:31:12.540 --> 01:31:14.430
<v Speaker 1>Cause who fucking cares?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the best.</v>

2152
01:31:14.470 --> 01:31:17.580
<v Speaker 1>That's my friends also the girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm assuming it's hot,</v>

2153
01:31:17.780 --> 01:31:18.601
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's great.</v>

2154
01:31:18.601 --> 01:31:20.970
<v Speaker 1>I love Columbia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2155
01:31:20.971 --> 01:31:24.540
<v Speaker 1>here's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're guys who can't fuck hot.</v>

2156

<v Speaker 1>planet because the guys who can't fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>'em are always going to be upset.</v>

2161
01:31:39.661 --> 01:31:40.940
<v Speaker 1>This bitch thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's better than me.</v>

<v Speaker 3>guy who's a very famous Mexican chefs.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Mexican.</v>

2299
01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:15.703
<v Speaker 3>He's a white guy from Oklahoma and there</v>
<v Speaker 3>was this whole article about whether or </v>

2300
01:37:18.111 --> 01:37:20.580

<v Speaker 3>Mexican cooks,</v>

2301
01:37:20.581 --> 01:37:23.420
<v Speaker 3>you think he's one of the best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His food is not flowing.</v>

2302

<v Speaker 3>You tell me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's widely recognized as a highly </v>

2303
01:37:27.021 --> 01:37:27.854
<v Speaker 3>respected well here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what makes people deep in this </v>

<v Speaker 3>is what makes us upset.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're a guy like you,</v>

<v Speaker 3>like you're one of those guys that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>deep,</v>

2306

<v Speaker 3>deep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>deep in the world.</v>

2307
01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:37.100
<v Speaker 3>Whereas like if you came to me and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

2308
01:37:37.101 --> 01:37:38.600
<v Speaker 3>this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to say anybody's name,</v>

2309
01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:40.220
<v Speaker 3>but this guy is hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like,</v>

2310
01:37:40.221 --> 01:37:41.840
<v Speaker 3>that guy was dog shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's got writers,</v>

2311
01:37:42.050 --> 01:37:42.883
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

01:37:42.920 --> 01:37:44.900
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's a guy that like,</v>

2313
01:37:44.901 --> 01:37:47.150
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his food's not bad,</v>

2314
01:37:47.180 --> 01:37:48.013
<v Speaker 3>but it's not great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's definitely not the best Mexican </v>

2315
01:37:49.401 --> 01:37:51.500
<v Speaker 3>food in America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he wins tons of awards.</v>

2316
01:37:51.710 --> 01:37:52.543
<v Speaker 3>Is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause it's white?</v>

2317
01:37:52.940 --> 01:37:53.773
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's because it's </v>

2318
01:37:55.591 --> 01:37:56.400
<v Speaker 3>complicated,</v>

2319
01:37:56.400 --> 01:37:58.950
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because he's white isn't wrong,</v>

2320
01:37:59.190 --> 01:38:01.110
<v Speaker 5>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's the Quan.</v>

2321
01:38:01.410 --> 01:38:03.540
<v Speaker 5>You remember like in Jerry Maguire that </v>
<v Speaker 5>like the Quan,</v>

<v Speaker 5>they can communicate with the writers </v>

2326
01:38:15.180 --> 01:38:17.550
<v Speaker 5>and the writers can write a story about </v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

2327
01:38:17.790 --> 01:38:20.010
<v Speaker 5>They're not winning because it's the </v>
<v Speaker 5>best food.</v>

2328
01:38:20.130 --> 01:38:22.410
<v Speaker 5>They're winning because there's a story </v>
<v Speaker 5>to write in,</v>

2329
01:38:22.411 --> 01:38:23.244
<v Speaker 5>a story to tell.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And Rick bayless being a white guy from </v>

2330
01:38:25.291 --> 01:38:30.291
<v Speaker 5>Oklahoma cooking maybe slightly above </v>
<v Speaker 5>average Mexican is a story.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Border Grill though.</v>

2333
01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:36.780
<v Speaker 5>You have a bunch of other people cooking</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

2334
01:38:37.140 --> 01:38:38.970
<v Speaker 5>Like what about when he's cooking it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wait,</v>

2335
01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.400
<v Speaker 5>let me check it to his restaurant named </v>
<v Speaker 5>Rick bayless.</v>

2336
01:38:42.060 --> 01:38:44.130
<v Speaker 5>I remember eating,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just don't want to be wrong.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Fuck him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's the guy that's got Tara Grill </v>

2338

2339
01:38:49.670 --> 01:38:52.110

<v Speaker 5>And he's in the airports now.</v>

2340
01:38:52.111 --> 01:38:54.080
<v Speaker 5>You've got all the airport restaurants,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

2341
01:38:54.081 --> 01:38:56.250
<v Speaker 5>it's weird man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're a standup comedian,</v>

2342
01:38:56.280 --> 01:38:57.113
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you open up a comedy club and some </v>

2343
01:38:58.531 --> 01:39:00.670

<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

2344
01:39:00.750 --> 01:39:03.750
<v Speaker 5>If you're a standup comedian and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>open up a comedy club and some whack ass</v>

<v Speaker 5>comedy club,</v>

2346
01:39:05.491 --> 01:39:06.750
<v Speaker 5>no one says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

2347
01:39:07.110 --> 01:39:09.450
<v Speaker 5>Joey Diaz is comedy club.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2348
01:39:09.451 --> 01:39:11.920
<v Speaker 5>I went there the other day and this guy </v>
<v Speaker 5>went up and perform.</v>

2349
01:39:11.921 --> 01:39:14.190
<v Speaker 5>This guy sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So Joe Diaz must be a bad comedian.</v>

2350
01:39:14.520 --> 01:39:17.040
<v Speaker 5>Like if you were going to judge Rick </v>
<v Speaker 5>Bayless,</v>

2351
01:39:17.190 --> 01:39:19.290
<v Speaker 5>you would have to judge him by his own </v>
<v Speaker 5>cooking.</v>

2352
01:39:19.440 --> 01:39:21.270
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever eaten his own cooking?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2353
01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:22.200
<v Speaker 5>You have?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2354
01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:25.740
<v Speaker 5>We're at frontera grill.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But were you there when he called it?</v>

2355
01:39:25.740 --> 01:39:26.730
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't meet him.</v>

2356
01:39:26.731 --> 01:39:27.810
<v Speaker 5>But he didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He wasn't there.</v>

2357
01:39:27.870 --> 01:39:31.500
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but here's the thing on the work,</v>

2358
01:39:31.560 --> 01:39:33.870
<v Speaker 5>like it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't matter if he's there or not.</v>

2359
01:39:33.871 --> 01:39:35.490
<v Speaker 5>It's your restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's your name on it.</v>

2360
01:39:35.491 --> 01:39:37.350
<v Speaker 5>If somebody comes in a house and has a </v>
<v Speaker 5>bad meal,</v>

2361
01:39:37.351 --> 01:39:38.184
<v Speaker 5>that's on me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think we're splitting hairs because </v>

2362
01:39:39.211 --> 01:39:41.940
<v Speaker 5>this is a restaurant where you're saying</v>
<v Speaker 5>his restaurants.</v>

2363
01:39:41.941 --> 01:39:42.391
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Good.</v>

2364
01:39:42.391 --> 01:39:45.090
<v Speaker 5>That I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But have you ever eaten his cooking?</v>

2365
01:39:46.140 --> 01:39:47.910
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like if you're in the restaurant,</v>

2366
01:39:47.911 --> 01:39:48.631
<v Speaker 5>that's his cooking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2367
01:39:48.631 --> 01:39:48.920
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2368
01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:49.421
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2369
01:39:49.421 --> 01:39:50.700
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is he cooked?</v>

2370
01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:54.120
<v Speaker 5>Have you eaten what he cooked?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have not sat in front of him and eaten</v>

2371
01:39:54.121 --> 01:39:55.100
<v Speaker 5>when he's cooking there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

2372
01:39:55.140 --> 01:39:57.200
<v Speaker 5>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is what,</v>

2373
01:39:57.210 --> 01:39:59.490
<v Speaker 5>that's what makes it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if somebody makes a chef,</v>

2374
01:39:59.491 --> 01:40:00.000
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what?</v>

2375
01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:01.410
<v Speaker 5>I caught a bad review.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was,</v>

2376
01:40:01.500 --> 01:40:04.260
<v Speaker 5>I was known for catching this bad </v>
<v Speaker 5>review.</v>

2377
01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:07.860
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at Shalia I had a restaurant,</v>

2378
01:40:07.861 --> 01:40:09.840
<v Speaker 5>Sam Sifton came in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was sitting in the dining room,</v>

2379
01:40:09.841 --> 01:40:12.180
<v Speaker 5>I was not cooking and he did not have a </v>
<v Speaker 5>great meal.</v>

2380
01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:14.340
<v Speaker 5>And you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I took it on the face and I owned it.</v>

2381
01:40:14.850 --> 01:40:15.950
<v Speaker 5>And the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Rick Bailey,</v>

2382
01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:17.550
<v Speaker 5>she doesn't make bad food.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just,</v>

2383
01:40:17.970 --> 01:40:21.750
<v Speaker 5>it's not for all the accolades he has.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not the best.</v>

2384
01:40:21.751 --> 01:40:26.751
<v Speaker 5>But also there's a bit of a thing with </v>
<v Speaker 5>food that the literati,</v>

2385
01:40:27.871 --> 01:40:28.920
<v Speaker 5>the intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

2386
01:40:28.930 --> 01:40:30.450
<v Speaker 5>the blogs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the magazines,</v>

2387
01:40:30.451 --> 01:40:33.540
<v Speaker 5>they're always electing people that they</v>
<v Speaker 5>can tell a story about,</v>

2388
01:40:33.541 --> 01:40:35.360
<v Speaker 5>speak English,</v>
<v Speaker 5>have this she,</v>

2389
01:40:35.361 --> 01:40:37.230
<v Speaker 5>she dining room.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're not,</v>

2390
01:40:37.231 --> 01:40:39.270
<v Speaker 5>it's not about the food they always </v>
<v Speaker 5>make,</v>

2391
01:40:39.271 --> 01:40:40.950
<v Speaker 5>they always talk about the food,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's not.</v>

2392
01:40:41.090 --> 01:40:44.820
<v Speaker 5>And I think that people of ethnic </v>
<v Speaker 5>cultures from the,</v>

2393
01:40:44.821 --> 01:40:45.654
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the background of Mexican food and </v>

2394
01:40:46.981 --> 01:40:47.814
<v Speaker 5>things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people get upset when there's somebody </v>

2395
01:40:49.530 --> 01:40:51.690
<v Speaker 5>else that didn't live the life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't grow up with.</v>

2396
01:40:51.691 --> 01:40:53.980
<v Speaker 5>It isn't the best at</v>

2397
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:56.020
<v Speaker 1>it representing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2398
01:40:56.021 --> 01:40:57.690
<v Speaker 1>like if it's going to be somebody from </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside,</v>

2399
01:40:57.700 --> 01:40:58.533
<v Speaker 1>he better be the fucking best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise get somebody who lived this </v>

2400
01:41:00.611 --> 01:41:01.444
<v Speaker 1>life and knows all the history and </v>
<v Speaker 1>identity and culture attached to this </v>

2401
01:41:03.521 --> 01:41:05.410
<v Speaker 1>food and let them speak for their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>food.</v>

2402
01:41:06.250 --> 01:41:07.083
<v Speaker 1>Part of the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this conversation is you want to talk </v>

2403
01:41:08.501 --> 01:41:09.940
<v Speaker 1>about the restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy runs,</v>

2404
01:41:09.941 --> 01:41:14.620
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk about him as a chef and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying you haven't had his food as a</v>

2405
01:41:14.621 --> 01:41:15.454
<v Speaker 1>chef.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what I've read is that he makes </v>

2406
01:41:17.440 --> 01:41:18.273
<v Speaker 1>excellent Mexican food and he really is </v>
<v Speaker 1>a student of the culture and is an </v>

2407
01:41:22.210 --> 01:41:23.043
<v Speaker 1>amorous by Mexican culture and Mexican </v>
<v Speaker 1>traditions and he's essentially a </v>

2408
01:41:25.991 --> 01:41:29.260
<v Speaker 1>scholar of Mexican food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he's done anything wrong.</v>

2409
01:41:29.290 --> 01:41:31.750
<v Speaker 1>I want to put that on there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you never does anything wrong.</v>

2410
01:41:31.780 --> 01:41:32.920
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to his restaurant,</v>

2411
01:41:32.921 --> 01:41:34.570
<v Speaker 1>but you would have the best one that had</v>
<v Speaker 1>the food,</v>

2412
01:41:34.571 --> 01:41:36.110
<v Speaker 1>but you've never had it from him.</v>

2413
01:41:36.290 --> 01:41:38.050
<v Speaker 1>But isn't that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't that mean something?</v>

2414
01:41:38.170 --> 01:41:39.640
<v Speaker 1>But you're saying it like it's not as </v>
<v Speaker 1>big a deal.</v>

2415
01:41:39.670 --> 01:41:41.290
<v Speaker 1>It's not because in the restaurant </v>
<v Speaker 1>industry,</v>

2416
01:41:41.291 --> 01:41:42.124
<v Speaker 1>the things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you walk in once you walk in the </v>

2417
01:41:43.241 --> 01:41:44.290
<v Speaker 1>door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's that man's food.</v>

2418
01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:46.840
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck all that man's food.</v>

2419
01:41:47.050 --> 01:41:47.720
<v Speaker 1>I agree with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2420
01:41:47.720 --> 01:41:48.553
<v Speaker 1>it's his recipe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's putting his whole thing he created </v>

2421
01:41:50.141 --> 01:41:52.630
<v Speaker 1>on the line and going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not cooking it.</v>

2422
01:41:53.410 --> 01:41:54.660
<v Speaker 1>I just feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2423
01:41:54.670 --> 01:41:56.320
<v Speaker 1>if you're leaving it to someone else to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do it,</v>

2424
01:41:56.321 --> 01:41:57.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might've had the bad,</v>

2425
01:41:57.671 --> 01:41:59.800
<v Speaker 1>it's like if you're an architect and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

2426
01:41:59.801 --> 01:42:00.300
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2427
01:42:00.300 --> 01:42:01.133
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a a builder of a house and </v>

2428
01:42:02.381 --> 01:42:05.260
<v Speaker 1>someone comes along and does a shitty </v>
<v Speaker 1>job building your creation.</v>

2429
01:42:05.290 --> 01:42:06.910
<v Speaker 1>Are you responsible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2430
01:42:06.911 --> 01:42:11.250
<v Speaker 1>if you were supposed to oversee every </v>
<v Speaker 1>single aspect of the construction beyond</v>

2431
01:42:11.260 --> 01:42:12.093
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I don't think he's done anything </v>

2432
01:42:12.881 --> 01:42:13.180
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

2433
01:42:13.180 --> 01:42:15.160
<v Speaker 1>And this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the one thing in this discussion</v>

2434
01:42:15.161 --> 01:42:16.990
<v Speaker 1>that I feel is unfair to some of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>chefs,</v>

2435
01:42:16.991 --> 01:42:20.290
<v Speaker 1>especially the white chefs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it's not their fault that journalists</v>

2436
01:42:20.291 --> 01:42:22.480
<v Speaker 1>and people want to give them more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody wants to give him more.</v>

2437
01:42:22.481 --> 01:42:24.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't expect them to throw it in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking ground.</v>

2438
01:42:24.430 --> 01:42:26.530
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem though is,</v>

2439
01:42:26.590 --> 01:42:27.423
<v Speaker 1>is the media and the people giving these</v>
<v Speaker 1>awards and the ones selecting saying </v>

2440
01:42:31.090 --> 01:42:33.310
<v Speaker 1>this is the best chef,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the best Mexican food.</v>

2441
01:42:33.610 --> 01:42:37.120
<v Speaker 1>It's really obnoxious to the people of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that culture that are like,</v>

2442
01:42:37.121 --> 01:42:37.954
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not really representing who we </v>

2443
01:42:39.341 --> 01:42:41.410
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now this guy's representing our food</v>

2444
01:42:41.411 --> 01:42:42.244
<v Speaker 1>in America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's the one you go to for </v>

2445
01:42:43.571 --> 01:42:45.190
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can we your talk,</v>

2446
01:42:46.090 --> 01:42:46.923
<v Speaker 1>let me just be honest with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one who goes to restaurants knows </v>

2447
01:42:49.331 --> 01:42:50.470
<v Speaker 1>about awards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one.</v>

2448
01:42:51.130 --> 01:42:54.340
<v Speaker 1>It's so rare that anyone ever discusses </v>
<v Speaker 1>awards,</v>

2449
01:42:54.370 --> 01:42:55.480
<v Speaker 1>but it's so a platform.</v>

2450
01:42:55.480 --> 01:42:58.330
<v Speaker 1>They give them the platform to speak </v>
<v Speaker 1>from Mexican food in America.</v>

2451
01:42:58.540 --> 01:43:00.640
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a guy people go to on top chef.</v>

2452
01:43:00.641 --> 01:43:02.730
<v Speaker 1>They always bring them in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that,</v>

2453
01:43:02.800 --> 01:43:03.633
<v Speaker 1>that you've given him the platform and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've given him the megaphone to speak </v>

2454
01:43:06.191 --> 01:43:09.220
<v Speaker 1>for a cultural fair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but part of like awards not,</v>

2455
01:43:09.221 --> 01:43:10.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody that wins.</v>

2456
01:43:10.640 --> 01:43:12.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the fucking awards are</v>
<v Speaker 1>for food.</v>

2457
01:43:12.581 --> 01:43:14.950
<v Speaker 1>I just know when someone's supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be a famous chef.</v>

2458
01:43:15.460 --> 01:43:15.940
<v Speaker 1>Did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

2459
01:43:15.940 --> 01:43:18.430
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing is he's been elevated </v>
<v Speaker 1>as the famous chef.</v>

2460
01:43:18.440 --> 01:43:21.430
<v Speaker 1>When you have the Aztec Karachi </v>
<v Speaker 1>restaurant in highland park,</v>

2470

<v Speaker 1>It's like a corn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like almost like an open faced,</v>

<v Speaker 5>You pick it up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2483
01:44:17.150 --> 01:44:18.240
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's hard to buy.</v>

2487
01:44:24.680 --> 01:44:25.670
<v Speaker 5>I believe you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then,</v>

2488
01:44:25.671 --> 01:44:27.950
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>also connie seafood and Inglewood is one</v>

2489
01:44:27.951 --> 01:44:30.820
<v Speaker 5>of the best Mexican restaurants you'll </v>
<v Speaker 5>ever eat.</v>

2490
01:44:31.250 --> 01:44:32.550
<v Speaker 5>Excellent Mexican restaurants.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

2491
01:44:32.551 --> 01:44:33.680
<v Speaker 5>but my point being,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

2492
01:44:33.681 --> 01:44:34.514
<v Speaker 5>does this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so you think it's deserve it that he's </v>

2493
01:44:36.801 --> 01:44:40.330
<v Speaker 5>getting shit because not because he's </v>
<v Speaker 5>the best Max.</v>

2494
01:44:40.350 --> 01:44:41.870
<v Speaker 5>Cause he's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's getting all these accolades,</v>

2495
01:44:41.871 --> 01:44:42.704
<v Speaker 5>not because he's the best,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but because it's easy to write a story </v>

2496
01:44:44.241 --> 01:44:45.074
<v Speaker 5>about him because he's a white guy from </v>
<v Speaker 5>Oklahoma and he's very articulate when </v>

2497
01:44:48.441 --> 01:44:49.274
<v Speaker 5>it comes to this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the people that select the </v>

2498
01:44:51.651 --> 01:44:54.590
<v Speaker 5>gatekeepers and the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the people who speak for culture,</v>

2499
01:44:54.650 --> 01:44:55.483
<v Speaker 5>they're picking a guide they can </v>
<v Speaker 5>communicate with easily makes their job </v>

2500
01:44:57.981 --> 01:45:02.120
<v Speaker 5>easy and can tell a story that's like </v>
<v Speaker 5>easily disseminate it,</v>

2501
01:45:02.180 --> 01:45:03.013
<v Speaker 5>easily disseminated amongst the masses.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I don't think it's Rick Bayless is </v>

2502
01:45:05.541 --> 01:45:06.374
<v Speaker 5>full.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think rick bayless has done </v>

2503
01:45:06.980 --> 01:45:10.670
<v Speaker 5>anything wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like in this context ever.</v>

2504
01:45:10.730 --> 01:45:15.530
<v Speaker 5>It's the media selecting him as you are </v>
<v Speaker 5>now the spokesperson for Mexican food in</v>

2505
01:45:15.531 --> 01:45:17.270
<v Speaker 5>America.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's like this motherfucker,</v>

2506
01:45:17.540 --> 01:45:19.820
<v Speaker 5>like if you're Mexican you'd be tight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2507
01:45:20.090 --> 01:45:21.280
<v Speaker 5>You'd be mad at that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2508
01:45:21.470 --> 01:45:23.060
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so who should be on the show?</v>

2509
01:45:23.061 --> 01:45:24.560
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So when we went to China,</v>

2510
01:45:24.650 --> 01:45:26.840
<v Speaker 5>I was craving American food.</v>

2511
01:45:26.840 --> 01:45:28.520
<v Speaker 5>I was in China for 17 days and I was </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2512
01:45:28.521 --> 01:45:29.354
<v Speaker 5>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I miss fucking hamburgers and a salad </v>

2513
01:45:31.191 --> 01:45:32.024
<v Speaker 5>and Nachos.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And we went to a place called Deli </v>

2514
01:45:33.260 --> 01:45:34.093
<v Speaker 5>Burger.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was the most popular American </v>

2515
01:45:36.291 --> 01:45:39.020
<v Speaker 5>restaurant for ex pats in Hunan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>China.</v>

2516
01:45:39.290 --> 01:45:40.123
<v Speaker 5>And we went,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this place had like pulp fiction </v>

2517
01:45:41.271 --> 01:45:43.280
<v Speaker 5>posters.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Big Lebowski was interesting.</v>

2518
01:45:43.281 --> 01:45:48.281
<v Speaker 5>They had like a Philips like fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>French dip logo thing in there.</v>

2519
01:45:48.591 --> 01:45:50.390
<v Speaker 5>They collected all these American </v>
<v Speaker 5>artifacts.</v>

2520
01:45:50.391 --> 01:45:51.224
<v Speaker 5>They bought an Amazon,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we ate their hamburger and it tasted </v>

2521
01:45:53.990 --> 01:45:56.450
<v Speaker 5>like Chinese food.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was hilarious.</v>

2522
01:45:56.840 --> 01:45:59.720
<v Speaker 5>This is delicious hamburger,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it wasn't a hamburger.</v>

2523
01:45:59.750 --> 01:46:02.450
<v Speaker 5>It tasted like they had a philly cheese </v>
<v Speaker 5>steak.</v>

2524
01:46:02.480 --> 01:46:04.310
<v Speaker 5>And my buddy was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's,</v>

2525
01:46:04.311 --> 01:46:06.470
<v Speaker 5>he's from Van Nuys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He ate it and he was like,</v>

2526
01:46:06.471 --> 01:46:07.304
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have so many friends that are Mexican </v>

2527
01:46:10.161 --> 01:46:10.994
<v Speaker 5>or Asian growing up in La that get mad </v>
<v Speaker 5>when white people or people not of the </v>

2528
01:46:15.681 --> 01:46:17.660
<v Speaker 5>culture make their food.</v>

2529
01:46:18.230 --> 01:46:19.910
<v Speaker 5>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this isn't representing us.</v>

2530
01:46:19.940 --> 01:46:22.600
<v Speaker 5>This isn't what they said does not map </v>
<v Speaker 5>Mapo Tofu.</v>

2531
01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:25.700
<v Speaker 5>This is not a soup dumpling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is some chef's creation.</v>

2532
01:46:26.060 --> 01:46:26.893
<v Speaker 5>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I never understood why they got mad </v>

2533
01:46:28.310 --> 01:46:30.110
<v Speaker 5>until I ate this philly cheese steak </v>
<v Speaker 5>cause he,</v>

2534
01:46:30.111 --> 01:46:30.944
<v Speaker 5>this is not a philly cheese steak,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is like stir fried beef in bread </v>

2535
01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:36.193
<v Speaker 5>and they should call it the Hunan Hoagie</v>
<v Speaker 5>cause it tastes good but it is not a </v>

2536
01:46:38.601 --> 01:46:39.434
<v Speaker 5>philly cheese steak.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I love philly cheese steaks and I </v>

2537
01:46:41.211 --> 01:46:42.044
<v Speaker 5>love hamburgers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's like when you see something </v>

2538
01:46:44.031 --> 01:46:44.864
<v Speaker 5>that you love being called something </v>
<v Speaker 5>else and being represented a different </v>

2539
01:46:47.751 --> 01:46:49.630
<v Speaker 5>way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's upsetting because your identify.</v>

2540
01:46:49.860 --> 01:46:50.340
<v Speaker 5>But</v>

2541
01:46:50.340 --> 01:46:51.173
<v Speaker 1>Rick Bayless in his defense does follow </v>
<v Speaker 1>traditional Mexican cooking methods and </v>

2542
01:46:55.411 --> 01:46:57.120
<v Speaker 1>makes food that tastes like Mexican </v>
<v Speaker 1>food.</v>

2543
01:46:57.830 --> 01:46:58.920
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

2544
01:46:58.980 --> 01:47:00.000
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

2545
01:47:00.270 --> 01:47:03.570
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is is that he's a fan and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a degree removed.</v>

2546
01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:05.610
<v Speaker 1>And it's like if you're gonna go to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>source,</v>

2547
01:47:05.611 --> 01:47:08.130
<v Speaker 1>why not just go to the source?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If for,</v>

2548
01:47:08.220 --> 01:47:09.660
<v Speaker 1>for many cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2549
01:47:09.661 --> 01:47:11.970
<v Speaker 1>like Andy Ricker is a really good friend</v>
<v Speaker 1>of mine,</v>

2550
01:47:12.210 --> 01:47:13.860
<v Speaker 1>but when people talk about Thai food in </v>
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>

2551
01:47:13.861 --> 01:47:16.950
<v Speaker 1>they go to him and he's a white guy from</v>
<v Speaker 1>Portland to Andy's credit.</v>

2552
01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:19.590
<v Speaker 1>And he is one of my best friends and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>love him for this.</v>

2553
01:47:19.860 --> 01:47:20.693
<v Speaker 1>He puts the names of the Thai people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that taught them things on his menu as </v>

2554
01:47:23.701 --> 01:47:24.534
<v Speaker 1>much as he can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He pushes the credit and he pushes </v>

2555
01:47:26.281 --> 01:47:28.680
<v Speaker 1>people towards the Thai people he </v>
<v Speaker 1>learned from,</v>

2556
01:47:28.681 --> 01:47:31.890
<v Speaker 1>so they can get it from the source.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But these journalists are fucking lazy.</v>

2557
01:47:32.220 --> 01:47:34.110
<v Speaker 1>They don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't go talk to those people.</v>

2558
01:47:34.111 --> 01:47:34.944
<v Speaker 1>It's harder because it's easier to call </v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy that speaks English and </v>

2559
01:47:37.290 --> 01:47:39.270
<v Speaker 1>communicate with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But journalists,</v>

2560
01:47:39.300 --> 01:47:43.830
<v Speaker 1>they can write one shitty restaurant </v>
<v Speaker 1>review and just take you down.</v>

2561
01:47:43.860 --> 01:47:47.430
<v Speaker 1>They have that power and that power is </v>
<v Speaker 1>really intoxicating,</v>

2562
01:47:47.431 --> 01:47:48.264
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2563
01:47:48.900 --> 01:47:51.720
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever dealt with like douchey </v>
<v Speaker 1>journalists that you felt like were kind</v>

2564
01:47:51.721 --> 01:47:52.554
<v Speaker 1>of out to get you?</v>

2565
01:47:55.730 --> 01:47:56.563
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a few people that I've done </v>

2566
01:47:57.831 --> 01:47:58.664
<v Speaker 1>interviews with in the first five </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes I could tell they're out to get </v>

2567
01:48:00.621 --> 01:48:01.454
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then once they can tell him pretty </v>

2568
01:48:02.841 --> 01:48:04.970
<v Speaker 1>genuine and honest and straight forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

2569
01:48:04.971 --> 01:48:06.440
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll love with this guy.</v>

2570
01:48:06.441 --> 01:48:07.340
<v Speaker 1>I'll talk to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So no,</v>

2571
01:48:07.341 --> 01:48:08.510
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

2572
01:48:08.750 --> 01:48:11.150
<v Speaker 1>I would not say that there were people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that were out.</v>

2573
01:48:11.690 --> 01:48:13.430
<v Speaker 1>There's a couple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can't even remember them because I</v>

2574
01:48:13.431 --> 01:48:14.320
<v Speaker 1>don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

2575
01:48:14.440 --> 01:48:15.273
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's getting harder and harder to </v>

2576
01:48:16.761 --> 01:48:18.830
<v Speaker 1>do that these days too because of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet.</v>

2577
01:48:19.120 --> 01:48:20.870
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone writes a shitty review,</v>

2578
01:48:20.871 --> 01:48:21.704
<v Speaker 1>it's so easy to out that person and </v>
<v Speaker 1>describe what exactly it was going on </v>

2579
01:48:24.231 --> 01:48:25.760
<v Speaker 1>behind the scenes and who that person </v>
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>

2580
01:48:25.780 --> 01:48:27.680
<v Speaker 1>And I respond on Ige,</v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter,</v>

2581
01:48:27.710 --> 01:48:29.700
<v Speaker 1>youtube people have a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to ask me something,</v>

2582
01:48:29.720 --> 01:48:31.430
<v Speaker 1>I'll answer it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm kind of,</v>

2583
01:48:31.460 --> 01:48:32.293
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to do the hip piece,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Ami cause it's like my information </v>

2584
01:48:34.261 --> 01:48:35.094
<v Speaker 1>is all out there.</v>

2585
01:48:35.300 --> 01:48:37.190
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People know they can talk to me.</v>

2586
01:48:37.191 --> 01:48:38.450
<v Speaker 1>I got the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

2587
01:48:38.451 --> 01:48:38.960
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2588
01:48:38.960 --> 01:48:39.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>

2589
01:48:40.400 --> 01:48:43.450
<v Speaker 1>What do you think is the future when it </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes to a tee?</v>

2590
01:48:43.850 --> 01:48:44.683
<v Speaker 1>I think like yelp reviews of common </v>
<v Speaker 1>taken away a lot of the steam from a </v>

2591
01:48:48.770 --> 01:48:49.603
<v Speaker 1>journalist's reviewing restaurants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause a lot of people when they want to </v>

2592
01:48:52.401 --> 01:48:54.710
<v Speaker 1>find out about a restaurant they'll go </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a yelp review.</v>

2593
01:48:54.950 --> 01:48:55.550
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll say,</v>

2594
01:48:55.550 --> 01:48:57.200
<v Speaker 1>oh well look at this four and a half </v>
<v Speaker 1>stars on yelp.</v>

2595
01:48:57.230 --> 01:48:58.063
<v Speaker 1>Let me read a couple reviews.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you read a couple reviews and he </v>

2596
01:49:00.021 --> 01:49:00.854
<v Speaker 1>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see what their other reviews are at </v>

2597
01:49:01.251 --> 01:49:02.084
<v Speaker 1>other restaurants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You find out whether or not they're </v>

2598
01:49:02.781 --> 01:49:04.880
<v Speaker 1>accurate or that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's disturbing.</v>

2599
01:49:04.881 --> 01:49:05.714
<v Speaker 1>When you find someone who's a Shill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you definitely can tell that </v>

2600
01:49:08.301 --> 01:49:11.280
<v Speaker 1>someone was like hired by that </v>
<v Speaker 1>restaurant to write some bullshit peas.</v>

2601
01:49:11.330 --> 01:49:13.490
<v Speaker 1>They only have one review and it's at </v>
<v Speaker 1>that restaurant.</v>

2602
01:49:13.530 --> 01:49:16.850
<v Speaker 1>It's super obvious yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just annoying man.</v>

2603
01:49:16.851 --> 01:49:19.220
<v Speaker 1>But I feel people are figuring it all </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

2604
01:49:19.250 --> 01:49:21.950
<v Speaker 1>Like at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cream rises to the top.</v>

2605
01:49:22.080 --> 01:49:23.810
<v Speaker 1>You fucking figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2606
01:49:23.930 --> 01:49:24.763
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why a lot of the stuff you were </v>

2607
01:49:25.971 --> 01:49:28.010
<v Speaker 1>saying is choose like hard work pays </v>
<v Speaker 1>off,</v>

2608
01:49:28.070 --> 01:49:30.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking the people who deserve it to get</v>

2609
01:49:30.231 --> 01:49:30.980
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2610
01:49:30.980 --> 01:49:32.210
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fucking do it.</v>

2611
01:49:32.270 --> 01:49:34.730
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 grand a year can't give people money.</v>

2612
01:49:35.090 --> 01:49:35.923
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I love like we started this </v>

2613
01:49:38.481 --> 01:49:39.314
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love the hate because it helps me get </v>

2614
01:49:40.941 --> 01:49:44.150
<v Speaker 1>better at like hearing the criticism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to work on my game.</v>

2615
01:49:44.240 --> 01:49:46.970
<v Speaker 1>I like to work on myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the end of the,</v>

2616
01:49:47.170 --> 01:49:48.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't hold onto it</v>

2617
01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:50.770
<v Speaker 5>anymore because your destiny is in your </v>
<v Speaker 5>hands.</v>

2618
01:49:50.890 --> 01:49:51.723
<v Speaker 5>Whatever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You may have to work harder than </v>

2619
01:49:52.931 --> 01:49:55.030
<v Speaker 5>somebody else,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if you work hard,</v>

2620
01:49:55.031 --> 01:49:57.190
<v Speaker 5>you can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can get there.</v>

2621
01:49:57.220 --> 01:49:59.860
<v Speaker 5>I genuinely believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do you like doing better?</v>

2622
01:49:59.890 --> 01:50:00.723
<v Speaker 5>Do you like working as a chef and </v>
<v Speaker 5>cooking and owning a restaurant or do </v>

<v Speaker 5>this craziness you do?</v>

2624
01:50:06.490 --> 01:50:07.323
<v Speaker 5>My favorite thing is writing real love </v>
<v Speaker 5>writing because I think writing if </v>

2625
01:50:11.111 --> 01:50:13.510
<v Speaker 5>forces me to be the most honest with </v>
<v Speaker 5>myself,</v>

2626
01:50:13.570 --> 01:50:17.470
<v Speaker 5>I get to work on myself and get closer </v>
<v Speaker 5>to like figuring out what life is about,</v>

2627
01:50:17.471 --> 01:50:20.050
<v Speaker 5>like the meaning of life shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and not to be Corny,</v>

2628
01:50:20.051 --> 01:50:20.884
<v Speaker 5>but I wake up and I think about it and </v>
<v Speaker 5>when I write every morning I get closer </v>

2629
01:50:24.461 --> 01:50:26.320
<v Speaker 5>and I'm puling back layers and I love </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

2630
01:50:26.500 --> 01:50:28.990
<v Speaker 5>But cooking basketball,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I'm,</v>

2631
01:50:29.140 --> 01:50:31.390
<v Speaker 5>when I'm playing or I'm cooking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it teaches me things,</v>

2632
01:50:31.391 --> 01:50:33.370
<v Speaker 5>but the place I go to figure it out as </v>
<v Speaker 5>writing.</v>

2633
01:50:34.450 --> 01:50:36.430
<v Speaker 5>I love writing.</v>

<v Speaker 5>coming out May 31st called Double Cup </v>
<v Speaker 5>love.</v>

2652
01:51:16.510 --> 01:51:19.630
<v Speaker 5>And it's about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think you might've met my,</v>

2653
01:51:20.260 --> 01:51:22.030
<v Speaker 5>my fiance the first time I came on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>show.</v>

2654
01:51:22.031 --> 01:51:25.090
<v Speaker 5>I think she came with me first time </v>
<v Speaker 5>anyway,</v>

2659
01:51:30.641 --> 01:51:32.620
<v Speaker 5>with my brothers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I wrote that book.</v>

<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2661
01:51:34.331 --> 01:51:35.164
<v Speaker 5>nonfiction,</v>

01:51:37.451 --> 01:51:38.284
<v Speaker 5>there in the most honest way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I started writing fiction because I </v>

2663

<v Speaker 5>want to write about my life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I want to like kind of grounded in </v>

2664
01:51:46.360 --> 01:51:47.193
<v Speaker 5>other characters and things like that </v>
<v Speaker 5>and explore it and work through the </v>

<v Speaker 5>ideas.</v>

2696
01:52:56.481 --> 01:52:58.850
<v Speaker 3>funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when you could have two windows open</v>

2697
01:52:58.851 --> 01:53:00.980
<v Speaker 3>at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just copy and paste back and forth.</v>

2702
01:53:05.841 --> 01:53:08.990

<v Speaker 3>except for,</v>

01:53:21.471 --> 01:53:22.580
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the writing.</v>

2712
01:53:26.420 --> 01:53:27.253
<v Speaker 3>You don't do shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just shows you only the writing and </v>

2713
01:53:30.111 --> 01:53:31.040

<v Speaker 3>Like that.</v>

2715
01:53:32.570 --> 01:53:34.130
<v Speaker 3>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's what your screen looks like.</v>

2716
01:53:34.160 --> 01:53:37.730
<v Speaker 3>It's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a black screen with green ink and that's</v>

2717

<v Speaker 3>Altitude helps makes you positive.</v>

2737
01:54:28.040 --> 01:54:28.873
<v Speaker 3>There's like studies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do that then it's like you get </v>

2738
01:54:30.321 --> 01:54:32.330
<v Speaker 3>euphoria in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you're that high up,</v>

2739
01:54:32.360 --> 01:54:35.100
<v Speaker 3>it's because there's no air up there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2740
01:54:35.140 --> 01:54:37.280
<v Speaker 3>rain's falling asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something,</v>

2741
01:54:37.520 --> 01:54:39.920
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some shit about altitude.</v>

2742
01:54:39.980 --> 01:54:40.740
<v Speaker 3>It gives you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you for,</v>

2743
01:54:40.740 --> 01:54:42.590
<v Speaker 3>this is another great program called </v>
<v Speaker 3>scrivener.</v>

2744
01:54:42.620 --> 01:54:43.880
<v Speaker 3>You ever tried that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what that is?</v>

2745
01:54:44.780 --> 01:54:46.870
<v Speaker 3>It's a program that allows you to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>

2746
01:54:46.871 --> 01:54:48.640
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a virtual chalk ball,</v>

2747
01:54:48.650 --> 01:54:49.483
<v Speaker 3>cork board,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it has all these little index cards </v>

2748
01:54:51.471 --> 01:54:54.920
<v Speaker 3>and you move around the cork board.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'll show you a here.</v>

2749
01:54:54.921 --> 01:54:57.080
<v Speaker 3>I've got it open up here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you,</v>

2750
01:54:57.081 --> 01:54:58.880
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could take some of your ideas and he</v>

2751
01:54:58.881 --> 01:55:02.120
<v Speaker 3>could write them on these little </v>
<v Speaker 3>corkboard things and then,</v>

2752
01:55:02.121 --> 01:55:03.170
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you,</v>

2753
01:55:03.171 --> 01:55:07.190
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll show you when it loads up other,</v>

2754
01:55:07.220 --> 01:55:08.053
<v Speaker 3>Jamie's got it.</v>

2755
01:55:10.730 --> 01:55:11.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like that.</v>

2756
01:55:12.020 --> 01:55:14.570
<v Speaker 3>So it gives you the option to do these </v>
<v Speaker 3>little,</v>

2757
01:55:14.600 --> 01:55:19.190
<v Speaker 3>so I got it like here and you put these </v>
<v Speaker 3>little little notes,</v>

2758
01:55:19.250 --> 01:55:20.083
<v Speaker 3>like little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's little tiny little fake index </v>

2759
01:55:21.561 --> 01:55:24.120
<v Speaker 3>cards and you can move these suckers </v>
<v Speaker 3>around on this.</v>

2760
01:55:25.080 --> 01:55:27.980
<v Speaker 3>It's called scrivener.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you write a lot of screenplays,</v>

2761
01:55:27.981 --> 01:55:28.814
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2762
01:55:28.820 --> 01:55:29.660
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

2763
01:55:29.690 --> 01:55:30.523
<v Speaker 3>I write,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to write a bunch of different </v>

2764
01:55:32.571 --> 01:55:33.404
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now primarily what I do is I write </v>

2765
01:55:34.671 --> 01:55:37.460
<v Speaker 3>essays and out of those essays I take </v>
<v Speaker 3>stand up ideas.</v>

2766
01:55:38.090 --> 01:55:41.300
<v Speaker 3>I used to ride a lot of blog entries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I found out that a lot of those blog</v>

2767
01:55:41.301 --> 01:55:42.134
<v Speaker 3>entries would eventually become standup </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was always like I was giving </v>

2768
01:55:43.981 --> 01:55:45.930
<v Speaker 3>people a preview of the standup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2769
01:55:45.931 --> 01:55:48.960
<v Speaker 3>better to write them for myself and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>just steal from them.</v>

2770
01:55:49.410 --> 01:55:50.820
<v Speaker 3>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm way into,</v>

2771
01:55:50.850 --> 01:55:51.960
<v Speaker 3>I used to do a blog too.</v>

2772
01:55:51.960 --> 01:55:52.793
<v Speaker 3>I love blogging,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm at a point now where I feel </v>

2773
01:55:55.080 --> 01:55:57.300
<v Speaker 3>people are such exhibitionists you do </v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

2774
01:55:57.301 --> 01:55:59.550
<v Speaker 3>He just immediately put it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to see what people think.</v>

2775
01:55:59.610 --> 01:56:01.110
<v Speaker 3>Read my shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2776
01:56:01.111 --> 01:56:01.890
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>men,</v>

2777
01:56:01.890 --> 01:56:04.740
<v Speaker 3>unless I made a Samurai sword,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want you to see it cause I don't</v>

2778
01:56:04.741 --> 01:56:05.574
<v Speaker 3>want to waste your time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want you to see the most fire shit I </v>

2779
01:56:08.251 --> 01:56:10.290
<v Speaker 3>made and I worked hard on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's worth your time.</v>

2780
01:56:10.680 --> 01:56:12.570
<v Speaker 3>That's a good attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes though,</v>

2781
01:56:12.571 --> 01:56:16.120
<v Speaker 3>I like reading people's blogs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes someone will write a Bra,</v>

2782
01:56:16.130 --> 01:56:17.520
<v Speaker 3>a blog,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it'll change your day,</v>

2783
01:56:17.610 --> 01:56:18.443
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just to change the frequency of the way </v>

2784
01:56:19.531 --> 01:56:20.364
<v Speaker 3>you think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And just for whatever reason their </v>

2785
01:56:22.321 --> 01:56:23.154
<v Speaker 3>thought just makes it into your mind and</v>
<v Speaker 3>bounces around in there and it changes </v>

2786
01:56:26.071 --> 01:56:26.770
<v Speaker 3>some things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2787
01:56:26.770 --> 01:56:28.190
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The right blocks.</v>

2788
01:56:28.200 --> 01:56:30.990
<v Speaker 3>I just think everybody's doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And for me personally,</v>

2789
01:56:30.991 --> 01:56:31.830
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

2790
01:56:31.860 --> 01:56:35.040
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to be in the lab and just only </v>
<v Speaker 3>put something out.</v>

2791
01:56:36.120 --> 01:56:38.430
<v Speaker 3>I put allowed a lot of shit about my </v>
<v Speaker 3>life in the last few years.</v>

2792
01:56:38.431 --> 01:56:42.030
<v Speaker 3>So I'm kind of making sure I really want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to share these things now.</v>

2793
01:56:42.240 --> 01:56:43.380
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2794
01:56:43.530 --> 01:56:44.363
<v Speaker 3>That's a thing about sharing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't unshare you can't unshare </v>

2795
01:56:47.670 --> 01:56:48.740
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>

2796
01:56:48.790 --> 01:56:49.610
<v Speaker 3>it's Kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2797
01:56:49.610 --> 01:56:50.443
<v Speaker 3>it's an interesting psychological thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This constantly giving yourself up to </v>

2798
01:56:53.461 --> 01:56:54.330
<v Speaker 3>the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2799
01:56:54.331 --> 01:56:56.790
<v Speaker 3>so there's a lot of people that live </v>
<v Speaker 3>inside their phone.</v>

2800
01:56:57.080 --> 01:56:57.913
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They live inside their laptop and their </v>

2801
01:56:59.221 --> 01:57:00.054
<v Speaker 3>phone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they live in it and their interaction </v>

2802
01:57:01.411 --> 01:57:03.270
<v Speaker 3>with the world comes directly through </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2803
01:57:03.300 --> 01:57:05.860
<v Speaker 3>That's their filter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's their condom for,</v>

2804
01:57:05.890 --> 01:57:06.810
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2805
01:57:06.840 --> 01:57:08.530
<v Speaker 3>intimacy with the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2806
01:57:08.540 --> 01:57:09.720
<v Speaker 3>It's very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2807
01:57:09.721 --> 01:57:12.450
<v Speaker 3>We're going to learn a lot about </v>
<v Speaker 3>ourselves constantly.</v>

2808
01:57:12.451 --> 01:57:13.284
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we're always learning about </v>

2809
01:57:14.401 --> 01:57:15.870
<v Speaker 3>ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think this internet thing,</v>

2810
01:57:15.871 --> 01:57:18.600
<v Speaker 3>it's people are starting to see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

2811
01:57:18.660 --> 01:57:20.280
<v Speaker 3>I put a lot of my shit out there.</v>

2812
01:57:20.640 --> 01:57:23.850
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm kind of naked out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then is this really who I am is just</v>

2813
01:57:23.851 --> 01:57:27.180
<v Speaker 3>some fucking alter ego.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm interested to see how this starts</v>

2814
01:57:27.181 --> 01:57:29.460
<v Speaker 3>to affect psychology and identity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2815
01:57:29.461 --> 01:57:31.470
<v Speaker 3>it's definitely affecting young kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2816
01:57:31.471 --> 01:57:34.440
<v Speaker 3>young kids today are so much more </v>
<v Speaker 3>exposed and we were,</v>

2817
01:57:34.441 --> 01:57:36.270
<v Speaker 3>when we were kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not even close.</v>

2818
01:57:36.271 --> 01:57:39.360
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to high school today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean everything is on instagram.</v>

2819
01:57:39.361 --> 01:57:41.500
<v Speaker 3>Everything is on facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anything that happens,</v>

2820
01:57:41.501 --> 01:57:43.020
<v Speaker 3>it's even remotely interesting in </v>
<v Speaker 3>school.</v>

2821
01:57:43.021 --> 01:57:44.190
<v Speaker 3>Gets put out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2822
01:57:44.550 --> 01:57:46.560
<v Speaker 3>I mean this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the world we live in today.</v>

2823
01:57:46.620 --> 01:57:48.180
<v Speaker 3>It's very different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I was just going to school,</v>

2824
01:57:48.181 --> 01:57:51.300
<v Speaker 3>nobody knew shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You heard a rumor about some girl across</v>

2825
01:57:51.301 --> 01:57:52.710
<v Speaker 3>town that jerk some dude off and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2826
01:57:52.711 --> 01:57:53.310
<v Speaker 3>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa,</v>

2827
01:57:53.310 --> 01:57:54.143
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me go jerk off and thinking about </v>

2828
01:57:55.651 --> 01:57:57.990
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But nobody,</v>

2829
01:57:57.991 --> 01:58:00.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody like put it out there in that way</v>

2830
01:58:00.841 --> 01:58:01.674
<v Speaker 3>where the rest of the world could look </v>
<v Speaker 3>at it and the rest of the world can see </v>

2831
01:58:04.621 --> 01:58:06.570
<v Speaker 3>virtually anything that you put online </v>
<v Speaker 3>today.</v>

2832
01:58:06.570 --> 01:58:09.420
<v Speaker 3>It's just a strange thing because when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're young,</v>

2833
01:58:10.140 --> 01:58:12.060
<v Speaker 3>you also don't understand the </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequences.</v>

2834
01:58:12.180 --> 01:58:13.050
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you're,</v>

2835
01:58:13.110 --> 01:58:16.230
<v Speaker 3>you're talking shit or saying something </v>
<v Speaker 3>or posting something,</v>

2836
01:58:16.231 --> 01:58:19.110
<v Speaker 3>you really have no idea what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what that's gonna do to people.</v>

2837
01:58:19.140 --> 01:58:20.460
<v Speaker 3>We look at these things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

2838
01:58:20.520 --> 01:58:22.530
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got 10,000 followers,</v>

2839
01:58:22.531 --> 01:58:24.810
<v Speaker 3>20,000 a hundred thousand million,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2840
01:58:25.290 --> 01:58:30.120
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it registers like 10,000 </v>
<v Speaker 3>people is a lot of fucking people.</v>

2841
01:58:30.150 --> 01:58:31.280
<v Speaker 3>Lots of neat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's camp.</v>

2842
01:58:31.290 --> 01:58:32.123
<v Speaker 3>All you need is one and that one to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>to someone who has 10,000 and that </v>

2843
01:58:35.101 --> 01:58:35.934
<v Speaker 3>10,001 of those 10,000 someone in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>group has 20,000 and that person knows </v>

2844
01:58:40.711 --> 01:58:42.880
<v Speaker 3>someone who's got 1,000,003</v>

2845
01:58:42.880 --> 01:58:43.713
<v Speaker 2>or four steps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of a sudden a million people have </v>

2846
01:58:46.031 --> 01:58:46.864
<v Speaker 2>seen that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then if it's funny or it's crazy or </v>

2847
01:58:49.211 --> 01:58:52.570
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting like here's another </v>
<v Speaker 2>cultural appropriation story.</v>

2848
01:58:52.870 --> 01:58:53.703
<v Speaker 2>There's this kid who was taken shit from</v>
<v Speaker 2>this girl because he's a white guy with </v>

2849
01:58:56.711 --> 01:58:58.960
<v Speaker 2>dreadlocks and I don't know if you saw </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2850
01:58:58.961 --> 01:58:59.794
<v Speaker 2>but there was this black girl and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this college in northern </v>

2851
01:59:02.021 --> 01:59:05.830
<v Speaker 2>California and she was given this little</v>
<v Speaker 2>tiny white dude a hard time.</v>

2852
01:59:05.831 --> 01:59:06.940
<v Speaker 2>She was just bullying him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2853
01:59:07.120 --> 01:59:09.160
<v Speaker 2>It was gross.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she was telling them,</v>

2854
01:59:09.161 --> 01:59:10.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cut your hair.</v>

2855
01:59:10.260 --> 01:59:12.370
<v Speaker 2>You have any saying to a friend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have any scissors,</v>

2856
01:59:12.371 --> 01:59:13.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to cut your hair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

2857
01:59:13.451 --> 01:59:14.530
<v Speaker 2>why can't I wear this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She goes,</v>

2858
01:59:14.531 --> 01:59:17.200
<v Speaker 2>cause you stealing from my culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is ignorant on her part.</v>

2859
01:59:17.201 --> 01:59:20.200
<v Speaker 2>She doesn't even know any better because</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Greeks had dreadlocks,</v>

2860
01:59:20.201 --> 01:59:22.180
<v Speaker 2>the vikings had dreadlocks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dreadlocks.</v>

2861
01:59:22.280 --> 01:59:24.760
<v Speaker 2>It was what happens when you have dirty </v>
<v Speaker 2>hair,</v>

2862
01:59:24.970 --> 01:59:27.730
<v Speaker 2>when you have dirty hair and it knots up</v>
<v Speaker 2>in these loops.</v>

2863
01:59:28.010 --> 01:59:29.440
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that video,</v>

2864
01:59:29.470 --> 01:59:30.303
<v Speaker 2>someone was filming her bullying these a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little tiny dude and this video of this </v>

2865
01:59:34.151 --> 01:59:36.820
<v Speaker 2>black girl bullying this tiny little </v>
<v Speaker 2>white guy,</v>

2866
01:59:37.150 --> 01:59:37.983
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking millions and millions of hits </v>

2867
01:59:40.750 --> 01:59:41.583
<v Speaker 2>within a day because people recognize </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and they were disgusted by it and </v>

2868
01:59:44.441 --> 01:59:49.441
<v Speaker 2>then people are also tired of all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>self appointed gatekeepers,</v>

2869
01:59:49.810 --> 01:59:50.643
<v Speaker 2>self appointed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know people that can tell </v>

2870
01:59:51.761 --> 01:59:52.594
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the beautiful things about </v>

2871
01:59:53.261 --> 01:59:56.920
<v Speaker 2>culture is that culture can be shared </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that people can look like me.</v>

2872
01:59:56.921 --> 01:59:57.754
<v Speaker 2>I grew up learning taekwondo and and </v>
<v Speaker 2>teaching classes in Korean because I </v>

2873
02:00:01.870 --> 02:00:04.960
<v Speaker 2>grew up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I spent my life doing and so</v>

2874
02:00:04.961 --> 02:00:06.970
<v Speaker 2>that culture became a part of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>culture.</v>

2875
02:00:06.971 --> 02:00:09.550
<v Speaker 2>It sounded go stealing it or culturally </v>
<v Speaker 2>appropriate.</v>

2876
02:00:09.551 --> 02:00:11.830
<v Speaker 2>I was doing it honor and trying to do it</v>
<v Speaker 2>justice,</v>

2877
02:00:12.340 --> 02:00:13.173
<v Speaker 2>but people have decided it's another new</v>
<v Speaker 2>way for someone to stand above them and </v>

2878
02:00:17.141 --> 02:00:20.140
<v Speaker 2>take the moral high ground and try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>control people's behavior.</v>

2879
02:00:20.240 --> 02:00:21.073
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would say this race is a social </v>

2880
02:00:22.641 --> 02:00:23.474
<v Speaker 5>construct.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you're only basis for an argument </v>

2881
02:00:26.900 --> 02:00:28.940
<v Speaker 5>is your race versus somebody else's </v>
<v Speaker 5>race.</v>

2882
02:00:28.970 --> 02:00:31.460
<v Speaker 5>You got to fucking shitty argument.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you know what I mean?</v>

2883
02:00:31.880 --> 02:00:32.713
<v Speaker 5>When it becomes something about </v>
<v Speaker 5>intention and we're talking about </v>

2884
02:00:35.241 --> 02:00:39.950
<v Speaker 5>intentions and we're talking about like </v>
<v Speaker 5>are you trying to take a culture?</v>

2885
02:00:39.960 --> 02:00:42.380
<v Speaker 5>Are you trying to support it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fan of this culture,</v>

2886
02:00:42.530 --> 02:00:43.363
<v Speaker 5>are you giving back to this culture?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those are productive conversations like </v>

2887
02:00:46.701 --> 02:00:48.470
<v Speaker 5>the one we had about rick bayless.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>

2888
02:00:48.471 --> 02:00:49.304
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not out here to try to slam dude's </v>

2889
02:00:50.181 --> 02:00:51.014
<v Speaker 5>food.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I know a lot of people love his </v>

2890
02:00:52.071 --> 02:00:53.510
<v Speaker 5>food,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I'm not saying,</v>

2891
02:00:53.540 --> 02:00:54.740
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know this shit.</v>

2892
02:00:54.741 --> 02:00:57.190
<v Speaker 5>I don't know Mexican Pharma,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking Chinese guy dear.</v>

2893
02:00:57.210 --> 02:00:59.900
<v Speaker 5>I mean like my opinion about Mexican </v>
<v Speaker 5>food doesn't matter.</v>

2894
02:00:59.901 --> 02:01:01.160
<v Speaker 5>Shouldn't matter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2895
02:01:01.520 --> 02:01:04.700
<v Speaker 5>but my,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my opinion about some this appropriation</v>

2896
02:01:04.701 --> 02:01:05.534
<v Speaker 5>cooptation stuff is I wish people didn't</v>
<v Speaker 5>have to have a gatekeeper or a tour </v>

2897
02:01:12.681 --> 02:01:13.514
<v Speaker 5>guide or somebody culturally similar for</v>
<v Speaker 5>them to try this food or go to this </v>

2898
02:01:18.081 --> 02:01:18.914
<v Speaker 5>neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would love if people didn't have to </v>

2899
02:01:21.231 --> 02:01:22.064
<v Speaker 5>have a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she she dining room with like American </v>

2900
02:01:24.261 --> 02:01:29.261
<v Speaker 5>style service or a white face or great </v>
<v Speaker 5>article to try this Mexican food.</v>

2901
02:01:29.751 --> 02:01:32.480
<v Speaker 5>Like I wish they would just go to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>neighborhood and go to the source.</v>

2902
02:01:32.720 --> 02:01:33.553
<v Speaker 5>And then there's no problem with Rick </v>
<v Speaker 5>bayless's food if we're all informed </v>

2903
02:01:36.591 --> 02:01:38.930
<v Speaker 5>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just tough when he,</v>

2904
02:01:39.080 --> 02:01:39.920
<v Speaker 5>the point of entry,</v>

2905
02:01:40.430 --> 02:01:41.263
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cultural appropriation to me is really </v>

2906
02:01:43.371 --> 02:01:45.200
<v Speaker 3>when you're pretending you're part of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>culture,</v>

2907
02:01:45.201 --> 02:01:46.034
<v Speaker 3>like of a dude pretends he's native </v>
<v Speaker 3>American and starts wearing feathers in </v>

2908
02:01:48.291 --> 02:01:50.720
<v Speaker 3>his hair and shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like that's a nutty person.</v>

2909
02:01:50.750 --> 02:01:52.180
<v Speaker 3>That's real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's legit.</v>

2910
02:01:52.600 --> 02:01:53.433
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it's also real cultural </v>

2911
02:01:54.081 --> 02:01:54.914
<v Speaker 3>appropriation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're wearing something that's </v>

2912
02:01:55.581 --> 02:01:56.414
<v Speaker 3>supposed to be sacred,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's certain articles of </v>

2913
02:01:57.861 --> 02:01:58.694
<v Speaker 3>clothing and in some cultures are </v>
<v Speaker 3>considered sacred and you're not </v>

2914
02:02:00.771 --> 02:02:02.360
<v Speaker 3>supposed to be just walking around on </v>
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

2915
02:02:02.570 --> 02:02:03.291
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2916
02:02:03.291 --> 02:02:04.390
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what else?</v>

2917
02:02:04.400 --> 02:02:06.110
<v Speaker 3>Things calls it a Bindi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are they?</v>

2918
02:02:06.570 --> 02:02:08.930
<v Speaker 3>Indian people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hindu people wearing their forehead,</v>

2919
02:02:09.260 --> 02:02:10.093
<v Speaker 3>you know the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that was like girls were wearing </v>

2920
02:02:11.211 --> 02:02:12.044
<v Speaker 3>those things and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think those are supposed to mean </v>

2921
02:02:13.341 --> 02:02:16.190
<v Speaker 3>something in certain cultures are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it Kinda,</v>

2922
02:02:16.191 --> 02:02:17.024
<v Speaker 3>I get it kind of looks cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to wear it because it looks </v>

2923
02:02:18.531 --> 02:02:18.860
<v Speaker 3>cool.</v>

2924
02:02:18.860 --> 02:02:19.770
<v Speaker 3>I get that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2925
02:02:20.060 --> 02:02:20.893
<v Speaker 3>But things get sketchy when you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>pretending to be a different culture or </v>

2926
02:02:23.331 --> 02:02:25.540
<v Speaker 3>you're lying about where you're from or </v>
<v Speaker 3>your a lot.</v>

2927
02:02:25.541 --> 02:02:29.900
<v Speaker 3>And that's in my eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more cultural appropriation or taking it</v>

2928
02:02:29.901 --> 02:02:32.090
<v Speaker 3>to give yourself an identity that is not</v>
<v Speaker 3>yours.</v>

2929
02:02:32.120 --> 02:02:34.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See all that is those just dishonesty.</v>

2930
02:02:34.760 --> 02:02:37.640
<v Speaker 3>It's like not a white dude wearing </v>
<v Speaker 3>dreadlocks,</v>

2931
02:02:37.641 --> 02:02:38.474
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not pretending to not be white or </v>

2932
02:02:39.831 --> 02:02:44.831
<v Speaker 3>like that Rachel Dolezal person that was</v>
<v Speaker 3>the NCAA NAACP person in spokane,</v>

2933
02:02:46.851 --> 02:02:49.010
<v Speaker 3>Washington who turned out to actually be</v>
<v Speaker 3>white.</v>

2934
02:02:49.080 --> 02:02:50.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the most insane.</v>

2935
02:02:51.530 --> 02:02:53.480
<v Speaker 3>It was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the funny thing is she,</v>

2936
02:02:54.260 --> 02:02:57.080
<v Speaker 3>she actually likes doing a great </v>
<v Speaker 3>tensions were like,</v>

2937
02:02:57.150 --> 02:02:57.983
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well she really does love black culture </v>

2938
02:02:59.331 --> 02:03:01.310
<v Speaker 3>and black people and she was doing a </v>
<v Speaker 3>great job,</v>

2939
02:03:01.311 --> 02:03:03.410
<v Speaker 3>apparently are running the naacp up </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

2940
02:03:03.620 --> 02:03:06.050
<v Speaker 3>She was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was insane.</v>

2941
02:03:06.110 --> 02:03:07.950
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was totally insane for was it.</v>

2942
02:03:07.970 --> 02:03:09.500
<v Speaker 3>But when I listened to her intentions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2943
02:03:10.130 --> 02:03:12.470
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you're a bad person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just really confused.</v>

2944
02:03:12.670 --> 02:03:15.260
<v Speaker 3>This is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how you got to this place.</v>

2945
02:03:15.290 --> 02:03:17.810
<v Speaker 3>I think some black dude Dichter and to </v>
<v Speaker 3>delirium.</v>

2946
02:03:18.340 --> 02:03:19.280
<v Speaker 3>That's why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happened?</v>

2947
02:03:19.560 --> 02:03:20.393
<v Speaker 3>He just fucked her so good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was just running around with tweety </v>

2948
02:03:22.581 --> 02:03:24.980
<v Speaker 3>birds flying around her head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She had no idea what she was doing while</v>

2949
02:03:24.981 --> 02:03:27.020
<v Speaker 3>she was doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just my thought.</v>

2950
02:03:27.080 --> 02:03:28.340
<v Speaker 3>She was a tough one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2951
02:03:28.370 --> 02:03:29.930
<v Speaker 3>this crazy people out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

2952
02:03:29.931 --> 02:03:32.390
<v Speaker 3>and there's a broad spectrum of crazy </v>
<v Speaker 3>activity.</v>

2953
02:03:32.570 --> 02:03:34.910
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of it that's logical and some of it</v>

2954
02:03:34.911 --> 02:03:35.661
<v Speaker 3>is not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of it,</v>

2955
02:03:35.661 --> 02:03:36.494
<v Speaker 3>there's a little tiny white lies and </v>
<v Speaker 3>some of it that's just pretending to be </v>

2956
02:03:39.411 --> 02:03:41.300
<v Speaker 3>a different race,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2957
02:03:42.080 --> 02:03:42.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2958
02:03:43.400 --> 02:03:44.233
<v Speaker 3>that's strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in that strange shit is like what </v>

2959
02:03:48.501 --> 02:03:50.210
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about before we can all </v>
<v Speaker 3>learn.</v>

2960
02:03:50.360 --> 02:03:52.370
<v Speaker 3>Like anybody that tells like little </v>
<v Speaker 3>white lies,</v>

2961
02:03:52.371 --> 02:03:53.204
<v Speaker 3>maybe they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll watch Rachel Dolezal or someone </v>

2962
02:03:55.161 --> 02:03:58.940
<v Speaker 3>else who got busted in some gigantic </v>
<v Speaker 3>cataclysmic lie and go,</v>

2963
02:03:58.970 --> 02:04:01.190
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why you shouldn't lie.</v>

2964
02:04:01.250 --> 02:04:02.083
<v Speaker 3>Oh that's why honesty and integrity are </v>
<v Speaker 3>very important to people because we </v>

2965
02:04:05.661 --> 02:04:06.494
<v Speaker 3>communicate through noises that we make </v>
<v Speaker 3>with our face that's supposed to level </v>

2966
02:04:09.531 --> 02:04:10.364
<v Speaker 3>out the intent of your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What people also don't realize is a lot </v>

2967
02:04:13.221 --> 02:04:14.054
<v Speaker 3>of the times they think that we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>friends with them for the peripheral </v>

2968
02:04:16.881 --> 02:04:20.120
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think most people like good people</v>

2969
02:04:20.121 --> 02:04:20.954
<v Speaker 3>that you actually want to be a friends </v>
<v Speaker 3>did not your friend because you have </v>

2970
02:04:23.781 --> 02:04:26.690
<v Speaker 3>dreadlocks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did Not your friend because you're aping</v>

2971
02:04:26.691 --> 02:04:27.524
<v Speaker 3>are you doing dear friend?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause they fucking like you and you </v>

2972
02:04:29.571 --> 02:04:32.000
<v Speaker 3>don't have to pretend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't got to pretend you don't gotta</v>

2973
02:04:32.001 --> 02:04:32.834
<v Speaker 3>fucking fake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just be who you are unless who you are </v>

2974
02:04:35.181 --> 02:04:37.370
<v Speaker 3>socks and then he's probably potentially</v>
<v Speaker 3>to on it,</v>

2975
02:04:37.590 --> 02:04:38.580
<v Speaker 3>then you got to work on it.</v>

2976
02:04:38.610 --> 02:04:39.660
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just pretend to be black.</v>

2977
02:04:40.100 --> 02:04:40.933
<v Speaker 3>I'm not doing a move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is Orange Spray Tan and dreadlocks and </v>

2978
02:04:44.460 --> 02:04:45.450
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2979
02:04:45.600 --> 02:04:46.433
<v Speaker 3>Well honesty is always better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then if people don't like you will </v>

2980
02:04:48.781 --> 02:04:49.614
<v Speaker 3>figure out why they don't like you and </v>
<v Speaker 3>improve upon whatever aspect of your </v>

2981
02:04:51.811 --> 02:04:54.360
<v Speaker 3>life that needs improving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't pretend.</v>

2982
02:04:54.540 --> 02:04:55.373
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like here's a perfect example of </v>

2983
02:04:57.751 --> 02:05:01.980
<v Speaker 3>something that just never works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Name dropping named droppings.</v>

2984
02:05:01.981 --> 02:05:03.630
<v Speaker 3>Always gross.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It never works.</v>

2985
02:05:03.810 --> 02:05:07.530
<v Speaker 3>But yet dummies still tried namedropping</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of people that still think</v>

2986
02:05:07.680 --> 02:05:08.513
<v Speaker 3>they'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know we were over hanging out with </v>

2987
02:05:09.561 --> 02:05:11.220
<v Speaker 3>the Tom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tom,</v>

2988
02:05:11.390 --> 02:05:13.380
<v Speaker 3>Dan last.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tom Cruise had dan first.</v>

2989

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2990
02:05:16.381 --> 02:05:17.214
<v Speaker 3>but that's different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I brought him up first cause I was </v>

2991
02:05:18.901 --> 02:05:21.840
<v Speaker 3>saying that he was going to be here when</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't go to your shit.</v>

2992
02:05:22.680 --> 02:05:24.730
<v Speaker 3>We brought up Shane Smith too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we're friends too.</v>

2993
02:05:24.990 --> 02:05:26.610
<v Speaker 3>We're all friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're all buddies.</v>

2994
02:05:26.611 --> 02:05:27.730
<v Speaker 3>That's different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All you can't,</v>

2995

<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

2998
02:05:32.190 --> 02:05:35.180
<v Speaker 3>But to other people listening.</v>

3027
02:06:36.510 --> 02:06:38.880
<v Speaker 3>It's like we were talking about before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we learned from each other.</v>

3028
02:06:39.030 --> 02:06:42.590
<v Speaker 3>We learned from really great stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we learned from shit too.</v>

3037
02:07:02.070 --> 02:07:03.720
<v Speaker 3>Well there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's definitely,</v>

3038
02:07:03.750 --> 02:07:06.300
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm joking around a lot about a </v>
<v Speaker 3>youtube comments.</v>

3039
02:07:06.300 --> 02:07:08.010
<v Speaker 3>There's actually some people that get </v>
<v Speaker 3>involved in,</v>

3040
02:07:08.011 --> 02:07:11.250
<v Speaker 3>I mean I go to science pages and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you look at the,</v>

3041
02:07:11.820 --> 02:07:12.653
<v Speaker 3>there's some interesting youtube </v>
<v Speaker 3>comments where people debate at the </v>

3042
02:07:14.911 --> 02:07:16.380
<v Speaker 3>actual ramifications.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry,</v>

3043
02:07:16.660 --> 02:07:19.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm fascinated by this planet nine thing</v>

3044
02:07:19.230 --> 02:07:21.960
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to observe now cause this</v>

3045
02:07:21.961 --> 02:07:25.560
<v Speaker 3>is something I've been studying for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>long time that uh,</v>

3046
02:07:25.620 --> 02:07:26.453
<v Speaker 3>they'd been thinking it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was very little evidence of it up </v>

3047
02:07:28.481 --> 02:07:29.314
<v Speaker 3>until recently,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that there was another planet </v>

3048
02:07:30.330 --> 02:07:32.760
<v Speaker 3>outside the Kuyper belt somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 3>outside of Pluto.</v>

3049
02:07:32.761 --> 02:07:35.290
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the reasons why they </v>
<v Speaker 3>declassified pluto was a planet,</v>

3050
02:07:35.710 --> 02:07:36.220
<v Speaker 3>but now</v>

3051
02:07:36.220 --> 02:07:39.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm there will almost positive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's a planet out there.</v>

3052
02:07:39.461 --> 02:07:40.510
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that the,</v>

3053
02:07:40.850 --> 02:07:41.683
<v Speaker 2>the said within 99% certainty that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a gigantic planet somewhere </v>

3054
02:07:45.881 --> 02:07:50.320
<v Speaker 2>around four to five times the size of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the earth that is out way,</v>

3055
02:07:50.321 --> 02:07:52.090
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way past Jupiter.</v>

3056
02:07:53.010 --> 02:07:56.500
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I was going to a lot of these youtube</v>

3057
02:07:56.530 --> 02:07:59.290
<v Speaker 2>videos that we're describing it and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>reading the comments,</v>

3058
02:07:59.291 --> 02:08:00.124
<v Speaker 2>the comments were fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's totally different sort of </v>

3059
02:08:01.961 --> 02:08:03.010
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3060
02:08:03.070 --> 02:08:05.770
<v Speaker 2>people are debating like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ramifications.</v>

3061
02:08:05.771 --> 02:08:09.100
<v Speaker 2>And then every now and then one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Zacharias hitch and people would jump in</v>

3062
02:08:09.101 --> 02:08:10.570
<v Speaker 2>there and do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Zacharias Itchiness?</v>

3063
02:08:10.930 --> 02:08:12.700
<v Speaker 2>Zacharias itching was a guy who </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>

3064
02:08:13.030 --> 02:08:15.730
<v Speaker 2>ironically enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>predicted this in the 70s,</v>

3065
02:08:15.970 --> 02:08:19.270
<v Speaker 2>but he called it the 12th planet because</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when they thought Pluto was still</v>

3066
02:08:19.271 --> 02:08:20.104
<v Speaker 2>a planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they thought the moon was a </v>

3067
02:08:21.401 --> 02:08:23.020
<v Speaker 2>planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3068
02:08:23.021 --> 02:08:24.830
<v Speaker 2>this is all based on the Sumerian texts.</v>

3069
02:08:24.850 --> 02:08:27.950
<v Speaker 2>This is all getting real convoluted now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Zacharias Hitchin,</v>

3070
02:08:28.240 --> 02:08:29.340
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3071
02:08:29.770 --> 02:08:31.930
<v Speaker 2>is a biblical scholar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's dead now.</v>

3072
02:08:32.200 --> 02:08:33.033
<v Speaker 2>But he wrote all these books about this </v>
<v Speaker 2>culture from another planet called the </v>

3073
02:08:36.881 --> 02:08:37.714
<v Speaker 2>Annunaki,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is transcribing the ancient </v>

3074
02:08:40.391 --> 02:08:41.224
<v Speaker 2>Sumerian texts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Sumerians were the oldest areas </v>

3075
02:08:43.940 --> 02:08:46.000
<v Speaker 2>that's see that thing that he's holding </v>
<v Speaker 2>up in front of him.</v>

3076
02:08:46.090 --> 02:08:51.090
<v Speaker 2>That is a piece of a Sumerian art that </v>
<v Speaker 2>depicts these,</v>

3077
02:08:51.401 --> 02:08:52.234
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks like some fucking transformer </v>

3078
02:08:53.320 --> 02:08:54.190
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3079
02:08:54.191 --> 02:08:54.970
<v Speaker 2>it does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3080
02:08:54.970 --> 02:08:57.280
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's interesting is you see that star,</v>

3081
02:08:57.840 --> 02:08:58.960
<v Speaker 2>you see the star,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sun,</v>

3082
02:08:58.961 --> 02:09:01.150
<v Speaker 2>with all the planets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is our solar systems,</v>

3083
02:09:01.151 --> 02:09:05.380
<v Speaker 2>not just our solar system that has all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the planets and all the right sizes,</v>

3084
02:09:05.770 --> 02:09:07.960
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3085
02:09:07.990 --> 02:09:08.823
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this was 6,000 years ago when a lot </v>

3086
02:09:11.411 --> 02:09:12.970
<v Speaker 2>of people didn't even think that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

3087
02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:14.050
<v Speaker 2>they thought the world was flat.</v>

3088
02:09:14.260 --> 02:09:15.093
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it also depicted this orbit is what </v>

3089
02:09:19.401 --> 02:09:20.234
<v Speaker 2>would they believe is this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that the Sumerian </v>

3090
02:09:21.731 --> 02:09:26.560
<v Speaker 2>texts describe is this elliptical orbit </v>
<v Speaker 2>of this planet called Nibiru.</v>

3091
02:09:26.740 --> 02:09:29.620
<v Speaker 2>And this planet isn't the outside edge </v>
<v Speaker 2>of our sources to mccombs,</v>

3092
02:09:29.710 --> 02:09:33.350
<v Speaker 2>between Mars and Jupiter in there in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3093
02:09:33.370 --> 02:09:36.430
<v Speaker 2>this Zacharias hitching translation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was every 3000,</v>

3094
02:09:36.431 --> 02:09:41.050
<v Speaker 2>600 something years and that this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>where the Annunaki came from.</v>

3095
02:09:41.051 --> 02:09:43.090
<v Speaker 2>And then what they did is they came down</v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

3096
02:09:43.300 --> 02:09:44.133
<v Speaker 2>they studied some lower hominids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they introduced their DNA into these </v>

3097
02:09:47.081 --> 02:09:47.914
<v Speaker 2>lower hominids and made human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he had predicted this planet </v>

3098
02:09:51.641 --> 02:09:54.370
<v Speaker 2>being outside of our solar system for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>long time.</v>

3099
02:09:54.760 --> 02:09:56.980
<v Speaker 2>It's different lies there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3100
02:09:56.981 --> 02:09:59.170
<v Speaker 2>it is there the oil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's on this planet.</v>

3101
02:09:59.460 --> 02:10:00.950
<v Speaker 2>The orbit is different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

3102
02:10:01.170 --> 02:10:02.003
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the size of the orbit is different </v>

3103
02:10:04.300 --> 02:10:05.590
<v Speaker 2>compared to what he described.</v>

3104
02:10:05.860 --> 02:10:07.420
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't even have a picture of it.</v>

3105
02:10:07.421 --> 02:10:08.254
<v Speaker 2>So we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we definitely don't know what it looks </v>

3106
02:10:09.371 --> 02:10:10.960
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>

3107
02:10:10.961 --> 02:10:11.794
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Annunaki as described by Zacharias </v>

3108
02:10:14.950 --> 02:10:19.950
<v Speaker 2>Hitchen is the same thing as in the bib,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Biblical term of the Elohim.</v>

3109
02:10:21.130 --> 02:10:22.900
<v Speaker 2>Like there's also some different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3110
02:10:22.960 --> 02:10:26.920
<v Speaker 2>descriptions of these giants that came </v>
<v Speaker 2>from somewhere else.</v>

3111
02:10:26.921 --> 02:10:27.754
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3112
02:10:27.790 --> 02:10:28.381
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3113
02:10:28.381 --> 02:10:29.214
<v Speaker 2>I think the description of what it means</v>
<v Speaker 2>is those from heaven to earth came and </v>

3114
02:10:33.110 --> 02:10:33.943
<v Speaker 2>idea is that there's advanced beings </v>
<v Speaker 2>came down here and genetically </v>

3115
02:10:36.531 --> 02:10:37.364
<v Speaker 2>engineered human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's widely discredited by other </v>

3116
02:10:41.120 --> 02:10:45.860
<v Speaker 2>scholars of ancient Babylonian and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sumerian culture,</v>

3117
02:10:46.040 --> 02:10:50.340
<v Speaker 2>but fun as shit to pretend and read and </v>
<v Speaker 2>read and wonder,</v>

3118
02:10:50.370 --> 02:10:51.201
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if he's right,</v>

3119
02:10:51.201 --> 02:10:52.070
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But see,</v>

3120
02:10:52.071 --> 02:10:53.630
<v Speaker 2>when you do look at some of the stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>

3121
02:10:53.631 --> 02:10:54.051
<v Speaker 2>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3122
02:10:54.051 --> 02:10:56.570
<v Speaker 2>well how did they know about the solar </v>
<v Speaker 2>system?</v>

3123
02:10:56.571 --> 02:10:58.310
<v Speaker 2>How did they know about all those </v>
<v Speaker 2>planets?</v>

3124
02:10:58.670 --> 02:11:00.800
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had the caduceus,</v>

3125
02:11:00.801 --> 02:11:01.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the caduceus,</v>

3126
02:11:01.550 --> 02:11:05.900
<v Speaker 2>the symbol for a medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also the double helix of DNA.</v>

3127
02:11:05.930 --> 02:11:08.000
<v Speaker 2>And that's what he believes that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>represented.</v>

3128
02:11:08.001 --> 02:11:08.834
<v Speaker 2>He believes that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that could do see a symbol that </v>

3129
02:11:11.181 --> 02:11:12.230
<v Speaker 2>they had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3130
02:11:12.380 --> 02:11:13.213
<v Speaker 2>represents DNA and that that's what the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the ancient Samarian people were </v>

3131
02:11:18.291 --> 02:11:22.130
<v Speaker 2>trying to describe when they carve these</v>
<v Speaker 2>things into clay tablets.</v>

3132
02:11:22.340 --> 02:11:27.340
<v Speaker 2>They were trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as best they could make some sort of a,</v>

3133
02:11:27.530 --> 02:11:29.090
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a rational,</v>

3134
02:11:29.091 --> 02:11:32.570
<v Speaker 2>logical depiction of what they are being</v>
<v Speaker 2>told by these,</v>

3135
02:11:32.571 --> 02:11:34.220
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these ancient people.</v>

3136
02:11:34.890 --> 02:11:35.723
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we might have already figured it out </v>

3137
02:11:37.700 --> 02:11:41.240
<v Speaker 2>once and then we're figuring out again </v>
<v Speaker 2>or not.</v>

3138
02:11:41.990 --> 02:11:44.720
<v Speaker 2>Or there's just a giant have decorations</v>
<v Speaker 2>that look like.</v>

3139
02:11:44.721 --> 02:11:46.940
<v Speaker 2>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the double helix,</v>

3140
02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:47.833
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at you looking at the double helix </v>

3141
02:11:48.561 --> 02:11:51.860
<v Speaker 2>of Dna and then you look at the caduceus</v>
<v Speaker 2>where this intertwined.</v>

3142
02:11:51.890 --> 02:11:53.340
<v Speaker 2>You see the top one with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ghettos.</v>

3143
02:11:53.660 --> 02:11:54.493
<v Speaker 2>If I was 6,000 years old man and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to design some shit with snakes </v>

3144
02:11:58.250 --> 02:12:01.820
<v Speaker 2>6,000 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would kind of look like that.</v>

3145
02:12:01.940 --> 02:12:02.773
<v Speaker 2>Well that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it does look like a double helix of </v>

3146
02:12:04.011 --> 02:12:05.540
<v Speaker 2>DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it really is very,</v>

3147
02:12:05.541 --> 02:12:07.820
<v Speaker 2>very similar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like a guy was just like trying</v>

3148
02:12:07.821 --> 02:12:10.340
<v Speaker 2>to decorate with two snakes totally on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the tango,</v>

3149
02:12:10.370 --> 02:12:14.090
<v Speaker 2>but why does it represent medicine and </v>
<v Speaker 2>why is it still represent medicine today</v>

3150
02:12:14.180 --> 02:12:15.013
<v Speaker 2>that could do ceus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That symbol still represents medicine </v>

3151
02:12:16.701 --> 02:12:17.534
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all when I'm having trump looks </v>

3152
02:12:19.490 --> 02:12:22.340
<v Speaker 2>weird shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's also some weird shit in terms of</v>

3153
02:12:22.550 --> 02:12:26.030
<v Speaker 2>some of the imagery that they had of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>solar system.</v>

3154
02:12:26.031 --> 02:12:26.864
<v Speaker 2>One is one of the most talent because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really bizarre that without a </v>

3155
02:12:28.941 --> 02:12:33.740
<v Speaker 2>telescope they were able to draw </v>
<v Speaker 2>detailed image of the solar system.</v>

3156
02:12:33.980 --> 02:12:34.813
<v Speaker 2>Like how the fuck did they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did they know that there was that </v>

3157
02:12:37.101 --> 02:12:37.934
<v Speaker 2>many planets out there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How were they able to differentiate </v>

3158
02:12:39.741 --> 02:12:40.574
<v Speaker 2>between stars and planets?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do they know the right number of </v>

3159
02:12:42.741 --> 02:12:43.574
<v Speaker 2>planets?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3160
02:12:43.610 --> 02:12:44.443
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they also had a detailed depiction of </v>

3161
02:12:45.951 --> 02:12:48.260
<v Speaker 2>the creation of the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to,</v>

3162
02:12:48.300 --> 02:12:51.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientists and astronomers,</v>

3163
02:12:52.100 --> 02:12:52.933
<v Speaker 2>they have earth one in earth to meaning </v>
<v Speaker 2>that earth was a certain size and a </v>

3164
02:12:56.001 --> 02:12:59.120
<v Speaker 2>certain shape in the beginning and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was hit by another planet.</v>

3165
02:12:59.590 --> 02:13:00.423
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's also in the ancient Sumerian </v>

3166
02:13:02.031 --> 02:13:02.864
<v Speaker 2>depiction of how the universe was </v>
<v Speaker 2>created or how the solar system was </v>

3167
02:13:05.121 --> 02:13:06.200
<v Speaker 2>created.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

3168
02:13:06.201 --> 02:13:10.640
<v Speaker 2>there's a planet called a Mar Duke and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Tmr and uh,</v>

3169
02:13:10.800 --> 02:13:13.310
<v Speaker 2>tmr collided with Mark Duke or something</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

3170
02:13:13.311 --> 02:13:14.144
<v Speaker 2>I forget exactly what the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but essentially it's earth one in earth </v>

3171
02:13:16.281 --> 02:13:17.114
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the same model that actual </v>

3172
02:13:19.700 --> 02:13:23.870
<v Speaker 2>astrologers astronomers use today when </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're describing the earth.</v>

3173
02:13:24.380 --> 02:13:25.213
<v Speaker 2>But he thinks these people from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other planet came here and created </v>

3174
02:13:27.520 --> 02:13:28.520
<v Speaker 2>humans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He does.</v>

3175
02:13:28.880 --> 02:13:29.631
<v Speaker 2>He thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3176
02:13:29.631 --> 02:13:30.920
<v Speaker 2>he's dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did.</v>

3177
02:13:31.230 --> 02:13:34.500
<v Speaker 2>He believed that that's what the ancient</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sumerian texts was trying to describe.</v>

3178
02:13:34.680 --> 02:13:39.090
<v Speaker 2>But there's a whole website called sitch</v>
<v Speaker 2>is wrong.com and Cichon is wrong.</v>

3179
02:13:39.091 --> 02:13:43.560
<v Speaker 2>Dot comes from other scholars who were </v>
<v Speaker 2>tired of listening to all this,</v>

3180
02:13:43.561 --> 02:13:46.260
<v Speaker 2>what they felt was nonsense and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3181
02:13:46.261 --> 02:13:48.720
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they sort of laid out what they think is</v>

3182
02:13:48.721 --> 02:13:51.510
<v Speaker 2>incorrect about his translations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But at the end of the day,</v>

3183
02:13:51.511 --> 02:13:52.344
<v Speaker 2>put the translations aside and you look </v>
<v Speaker 2>in at a 6,000 year old depiction of the </v>

3184
02:13:56.281 --> 02:13:57.510
<v Speaker 2>solar system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3185
02:13:57.511 --> 02:13:59.490
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>

3186
02:13:59.491 --> 02:14:03.540
<v Speaker 2>there's these also depictions of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>enormous people with these little monkey</v>

3187
02:14:03.541 --> 02:14:04.374
<v Speaker 2>people sitting in their lap and this was</v>
<v Speaker 2>what he believed was describing the </v>

3188
02:14:07.921 --> 02:14:08.754
<v Speaker 2>Annunaki,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these genetic alterations of monkeys of </v>

3189
02:14:11.341 --> 02:14:12.174
<v Speaker 2>taking these lower hominids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>introducing their superior advanced DNA </v>

3190
02:14:16.201 --> 02:14:19.650
<v Speaker 2>into these monkeys and creating </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that's very different.</v>

3191
02:14:20.550 --> 02:14:24.660
<v Speaker 2>Doodoodoo too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know we would do it.</v>

3192
02:14:24.900 --> 02:14:27.660
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you that for fuck shore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3193
02:14:27.661 --> 02:14:29.880
<v Speaker 2>If we found another planet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a bunch of dumb monkeys on.</v>

3194
02:14:30.100 --> 02:14:35.100
<v Speaker 2>He did a detailed like audit of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>planet and found no higher animals.</v>

3195
02:14:35.190 --> 02:14:37.890
<v Speaker 2>Nothing that had a computer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would drop our seeds.</v>

3196
02:14:39.300 --> 02:14:40.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll probably already looking for those</v>

3197
02:14:40.831 --> 02:14:42.150
<v Speaker 2>places to just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3198
02:14:42.151 --> 02:14:44.100
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At the very least,</v>

3199
02:14:44.101 --> 02:14:46.380
<v Speaker 2>I won't fuck one of those things like </v>
<v Speaker 2>Avatar.</v>

3200
02:14:46.650 --> 02:14:47.483
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was like one of the most realistic </v>

3201
02:14:48.991 --> 02:14:51.660
<v Speaker 2>things about Avatar that that dude </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to fuck one of those blue people.</v>

3202
02:14:51.690 --> 02:14:53.790
<v Speaker 2>I would be scared to put my dick in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>blue person.</v>

3203
02:14:53.850 --> 02:14:55.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You never know what's going on in there.</v>

3204
02:14:55.050 --> 02:14:56.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3205
02:14:56.040 --> 02:14:56.873
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that shit probably burns through </v>

3206
02:14:57.891 --> 02:15:00.240
<v Speaker 2>condoms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially if they leunig blue people.</v>

3207
02:15:00.300 --> 02:15:01.860
<v Speaker 2>There's so much bigger than us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3208
02:15:02.070 --> 02:15:03.180
<v Speaker 2>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3209
02:15:03.480 --> 02:15:06.600
<v Speaker 2>especially when you look at the mating </v>
<v Speaker 2>habits of things that we know on earth.</v>

3210
02:15:07.170 --> 02:15:11.840
<v Speaker 2>What does this 36 foot five dog and </v>
<v Speaker 2>skeleton so that away,</v>

3211
02:15:11.850 --> 02:15:16.020
<v Speaker 2>what are you going above top secret dot </v>
<v Speaker 2>cops foot tall blue person.</v>

3212
02:15:16.410 --> 02:15:17.220
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you do,</v>

3213
02:15:17.220 --> 02:15:19.340
<v Speaker 2>you're going to need some help.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got,</v>

3214
02:15:19.500 --> 02:15:22.290
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to do it alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>36 foot tall.</v>

3215
02:15:22.291 --> 02:15:24.990
<v Speaker 2>That shit is so not real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3216
02:15:25.680 --> 02:15:27.570
<v Speaker 2>it says it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of it,</v>

3217
02:15:27.571 --> 02:15:29.190
<v Speaker 2>it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you look at that,</v>

3218
02:15:29.191 --> 02:15:30.990
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that image that you had pulled up before</v>

3219
02:15:30.991 --> 02:15:31.824
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an image of one of those </v>

3220
02:15:32.581 --> 02:15:35.100
<v Speaker 2>Annunaki having a person having a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little,</v>

3221
02:15:35.101 --> 02:15:40.080
<v Speaker 2>a monkey like person sitting in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>lap sign on this page is before when you</v>

3222
02:15:40.081 --> 02:15:42.180
<v Speaker 2>had a look at some of those other </v>
<v Speaker 2>images,</v>

3223
02:15:42.420 --> 02:15:46.050
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these ones where these guys,</v>

3224
02:15:46.051 --> 02:15:46.884
<v Speaker 2>these enormous looking characters have </v>
<v Speaker 2>these little tiny monkey people with </v>

3225
02:15:51.001 --> 02:15:53.700
<v Speaker 2>thumbs and their feet and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting on this guy's lap,</v>

3226
02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.130
<v Speaker 2>death thumbs on the feet and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>drawing.</v>

3227
02:15:56.160 --> 02:15:56.601
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

3228
02:15:56.601 --> 02:16:00.270
<v Speaker 2>they're smaller and they have thumbs on </v>
<v Speaker 2>their lap and according to the text,</v>

3229
02:16:00.271 --> 02:16:01.104
<v Speaker 2>this guy described it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The text is very confusing too because </v>

3230
02:16:03.541 --> 02:16:06.130
<v Speaker 2>it's something called cuneiform and </v>
<v Speaker 2>cuneiform.</v>

3231
02:16:06.210 --> 02:16:07.043
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you ever been in an old </v>
<v Speaker 2>building that has like those old school </v>

3232
02:16:09.421 --> 02:16:10.254
<v Speaker 2>nails,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you know what those old school nails </v>

3233
02:16:11.761 --> 02:16:13.020
<v Speaker 2>look like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like in the turn of the century,</v>

3234
02:16:13.021 --> 02:16:13.854
<v Speaker 2>they were like a flat top,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was almost like a wedge and </v>

3235
02:16:15.931 --> 02:16:17.280
<v Speaker 2>that's what nails looked like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3236
02:16:17.340 --> 02:16:18.990
<v Speaker 2>that's how they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was their writing.</v>

3237
02:16:18.991 --> 02:16:20.550
<v Speaker 2>That's not that Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's,</v>

3238
02:16:20.760 --> 02:16:22.460
<v Speaker 2>that's one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's similar though.</v>

3239
02:16:22.470 --> 02:16:23.303
<v Speaker 2>But this is a Gypson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're looking at something that's </v>

3240
02:16:24.451 --> 02:16:27.810
<v Speaker 2>Egyptian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3241
02:16:27.960 --> 02:16:29.950
<v Speaker 2>but the Annunaki one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3242
02:16:30.100 --> 02:16:30.933
<v Speaker 3>you had had it from just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you go back to that window that you </v>

3243
02:16:32.771 --> 02:16:33.604
<v Speaker 3>had before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go back to that window that you had </v>

3244
02:16:34.871 --> 02:16:37.510
<v Speaker 3>before that had the depiction of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>solar system on that one.</v>

3245
02:16:37.511 --> 02:16:38.201
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3246
02:16:38.201 --> 02:16:41.350
<v Speaker 3>because when you would win whatever </v>
<v Speaker 3>search that you use for that,</v>

3247
02:16:41.890 --> 02:16:42.723
<v Speaker 3>there was one of them that had one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>those home boys had one of them sitting </v>

3248
02:16:45.581 --> 02:16:46.900
<v Speaker 3>on his lap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right up there.</v>

3249
02:16:46.930 --> 02:16:49.210
<v Speaker 3>Right up there at the top.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll see right there.</v>

3250
02:16:49.211 --> 02:16:50.140
<v Speaker 3>Bam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See that?</v>

3251
02:16:50.590 --> 02:16:52.120
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at that.</v>

3252
02:16:52.121 --> 02:16:53.500
<v Speaker 3>The thumb foot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3253
02:16:54.340 --> 02:16:55.173
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a few of these that have a </v>

3254
02:16:57.310 --> 02:17:01.990
<v Speaker 3>little weird that people think are </v>
<v Speaker 3>depictions of things with tails.</v>

3255
02:17:02.620 --> 02:17:04.180
<v Speaker 3>It's very strange stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3256
02:17:04.360 --> 02:17:06.370
<v Speaker 3>It's very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At the very least,</v>

3257
02:17:06.520 --> 02:17:09.100
<v Speaker 3>they had an advanced knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a Tele Toby.</v>

3258
02:17:09.130 --> 02:17:11.980
<v Speaker 3>The one he's holding up Kinda looks like</v>
<v Speaker 3>a teletubby.</v>

3259
02:17:12.070 --> 02:17:12.903
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't look like a monkey in that </v>

3260
02:17:13.481 --> 02:17:14.810
<v Speaker 3>picture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in some of them they have,</v>

3261
02:17:14.860 --> 02:17:18.520
<v Speaker 3>they actually look like they have tails </v>
<v Speaker 3>and got the fuck boy not haircut too.</v>

3262
02:17:18.910 --> 02:17:19.743
<v Speaker 3>There's all sorts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's all sorts of weird stuff </v>

3263
02:17:21.401 --> 02:17:22.234
<v Speaker 3>involved in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their knowledge of the solar system was </v>

3264
02:17:23.891 --> 02:17:27.400
<v Speaker 3>one of the most disturbing things </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're talking about 6,000 years</v>

3265
02:17:27.401 --> 02:17:28.234
<v Speaker 3>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how did they know about all those </v>

3266
02:17:29.381 --> 02:17:31.570
<v Speaker 3>planets?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How did they know that they were,</v>

3267
02:17:31.630 --> 02:17:32.071
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

3268
02:17:32.071 --> 02:17:33.670
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they knew the right orbit.</v>

3269
02:17:34.210 --> 02:17:35.043
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they knew that Jupiter was like far </v>

3270
02:17:36.431 --> 02:17:39.310
<v Speaker 3>larger than Mars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had more smaller than earth.</v>

3271
02:17:39.460 --> 02:17:41.200
<v Speaker 3>They had like all the orbits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>

3272
02:17:41.201 --> 02:17:43.500
<v Speaker 3>It was a really strange stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>

3273
02:17:44.320 --> 02:17:46.870
<v Speaker 3>it's too good to be a coincidence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then I'm like,</v>

3274
02:17:46.871 --> 02:17:49.760
<v Speaker 3>I dunno if I believe the whole Shebang,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3275
02:17:50.050 --> 02:17:51.760
<v Speaker 3>almost always the whole Shebang is </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong,</v>

3276
02:17:51.820 --> 02:17:54.460
<v Speaker 3>but it would be awesome if somebody just</v>
<v Speaker 3>showed up on this planet.</v>

3277
02:17:54.461 --> 02:17:56.620
<v Speaker 3>Like optimus prime one day was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

3278
02:17:57.040 --> 02:18:00.100
<v Speaker 3>I created you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've been over here.</v>

3279
02:18:00.101 --> 02:18:00.934
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3280
02:18:01.330 --> 02:18:03.490
<v Speaker 3>I've been wondering where you guys were.</v>

3281
02:18:03.550 --> 02:18:05.320
<v Speaker 3>What'd you think that that would be fun </v>
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>

3282
02:18:05.321 --> 02:18:06.154
<v Speaker 3>It would be awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it better to be at the top of the </v>

3283
02:18:08.261 --> 02:18:09.094
<v Speaker 3>food chain then?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could we waiting for galactic overlords </v>

3284
02:18:11.231 --> 02:18:13.720
<v Speaker 3>to tell us how much we suck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would just be,</v>

3285
02:18:13.750 --> 02:18:14.583
<v Speaker 3>it would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would be just awesome if somebody </v>

3286
02:18:15.431 --> 02:18:16.870
<v Speaker 3>showed up like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what life's about.</v>

3287
02:18:16.871 --> 02:18:19.750
<v Speaker 3>This which is supposed to do at a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking ideas are terrible.</v>

3288
02:18:20.080 --> 02:18:20.913
<v Speaker 3>I'm pleased fucking do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would be devastating to the self </v>

3289
02:18:23.531 --> 02:18:24.364
<v Speaker 3>esteem of people living on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you that because it would </v>

3290
02:18:25.811 --> 02:18:30.760
<v Speaker 3>realize we'd be like very lord of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>flies asked like we were a bunch of kids</v>

3291
02:18:30.761 --> 02:18:33.700
<v Speaker 3>left alone to our own devices and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>when the adults showed up,</v>

3292
02:18:33.701 --> 02:18:35.800
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck are you doing here?</v>

3293
02:18:36.450 --> 02:18:37.283
<v Speaker 3>You realized everybody was just acting </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a psychopath because they have no </v>

3294
02:18:41.051 --> 02:18:42.040
<v Speaker 3>one to look over them.</v>

3295
02:18:42.370 --> 02:18:45.040
<v Speaker 3>It would be cool though if if that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I've been doing it all wrong,</v>

3296
02:18:45.041 --> 02:18:47.110
<v Speaker 3>I kind of want to know what the hell </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're supposed to do,</v>

3297
02:18:47.170 --> 02:18:48.760
<v Speaker 3>what we're definitely doing it all </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong,</v>

3298
02:18:49.360 --> 02:18:51.160
<v Speaker 3>but I think we're supposed to figure it </v>
<v Speaker 3>out on her own.</v>

3299
02:18:51.161 --> 02:18:51.820
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

3300
02:18:51.820 --> 02:18:53.560
<v Speaker 3>if we've got Ted Cruz,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Donald Trump,</v>

3301
02:18:53.561 --> 02:18:54.394
<v Speaker 3>Hillary Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Bernie Sanders is their only hopes </v>

3302
02:18:56.230 --> 02:18:59.320
<v Speaker 3>to be the commander in chief for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>greatest army the world's ever known for</v>

3303
02:18:59.321 --> 02:19:00.850
<v Speaker 3>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure we doing to now.</v>

3304
02:19:01.210 --> 02:19:03.640
<v Speaker 3>We're 100% doing it wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

3305
02:19:03.641 --> 02:19:08.641
<v Speaker 3>these are not the great scholars and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>great intellectuals that we need to help</v>

3306
02:19:09.671 --> 02:19:11.590
<v Speaker 3>run this world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no one amongst them.</v>

3307
02:19:11.591 --> 02:19:13.570
<v Speaker 3>That has like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a brilliant philosophy.</v>

3308
02:19:13.720 --> 02:19:16.480
<v Speaker 3>Even when you're looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're looking at Bernie and Hillary and</v>

3309
02:19:16.481 --> 02:19:17.760
<v Speaker 3>Bernie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as much as I love him,</v>

3310
02:19:17.790 --> 02:19:21.070
<v Speaker 3>as much as I love some of his ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see that guy and Hillary and they're</v>

3311
02:19:21.071 --> 02:19:24.550
<v Speaker 3>bickering back and forth on during these</v>
<v Speaker 3>debates.</v>

3312
02:19:24.670 --> 02:19:28.250
<v Speaker 3>That's so unbecoming of someone who's to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be the president.</v>

3313
02:19:28.280 --> 02:19:29.210
<v Speaker 3>The leader.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3314
02:19:29.240 --> 02:19:30.073
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially a dude who's in his sixties </v>

3315
02:19:31.401 --> 02:19:32.800
<v Speaker 3>and some lady you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3316
02:19:32.810 --> 02:19:36.050
<v Speaker 3>she covers everything except the very </v>
<v Speaker 3>top of her neck.</v>

3317
02:19:36.320 --> 02:19:38.210
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's bizarre.</v>

3318
02:19:38.300 --> 02:19:41.930
<v Speaker 3>It's bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're supposed to be further along</v>

3319
02:19:41.931 --> 02:19:44.570
<v Speaker 3>in this crazy journey than us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you want to be.</v>

3320
02:19:44.571 --> 02:19:45.404
<v Speaker 3>The president used to be so far ahead </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you have some lessons that you can </v>

3321
02:19:48.321 --> 02:19:49.154
<v Speaker 3>impart upon the rest of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have some ideas about how we can </v>

3322
02:19:51.441 --> 02:19:55.430
<v Speaker 3>improve our policies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have some ideas on what laws that we</v>

3323
02:19:55.431 --> 02:19:56.264
<v Speaker 3>can establish that would probably better</v>
<v Speaker 3>to protect us from greed and from evil </v>

3324
02:20:00.021 --> 02:20:00.854
<v Speaker 3>corporations and from people that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>raping the world of all its natural </v>

3325
02:20:03.021 --> 02:20:04.490
<v Speaker 3>resources.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All those ideas.</v>

3326
02:20:04.880 --> 02:20:06.590
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing is to really smart people,</v>

3327
02:20:06.610 --> 02:20:09.500
<v Speaker 3>do they have other ways to control and </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking rule the planet?</v>

3328
02:20:09.920 --> 02:20:10.401
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3329
02:20:10.401 --> 02:20:12.950
<v Speaker 3>I don't think the president is actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>the most powerful person.</v>

3330
02:20:13.220 --> 02:20:14.630
<v Speaker 3>You go on Illuminati on me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3331
02:20:14.631 --> 02:20:15.590
<v Speaker 3>Number?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>

3332
02:20:15.650 --> 02:20:18.080
<v Speaker 3>Do you believe in the Illuminati </v>
<v Speaker 3>Illuminati?</v>

3333
02:20:18.081 --> 02:20:18.914
<v Speaker 3>But I just think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if for some of these people that </v>

3334
02:20:21.510 --> 02:20:23.390
<v Speaker 3>what I like Michael,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Bloomberg,</v>

3335
02:20:23.420 --> 02:20:24.253
<v Speaker 3>why would bloomberg one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bloomberg can already fucking close </v>

3336
02:20:25.851 --> 02:20:28.760
<v Speaker 3>shots from where he's at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has more money than fucking anybody.</v>

3337
02:20:28.820 --> 02:20:31.970
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe he feels like the system is broken</v>

3338
02:20:31.971 --> 02:20:32.804
<v Speaker 3>and he's in a potential,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's in a situation to give his life </v>

3339
02:20:35.241 --> 02:20:38.300
<v Speaker 3>meaning and maybe enhance the lives of </v>
<v Speaker 3>other people by helping.</v>

3340
02:20:38.510 --> 02:20:41.210
<v Speaker 3>I don't know cause I don't know him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not even familiar with him,</v>

3341
02:20:41.390 --> 02:20:43.490
<v Speaker 3>but I'm just playing devil's advocate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3342
02:20:43.700 --> 02:20:45.890
<v Speaker 3>I have advocate would say that that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3343
02:20:45.891 --> 02:20:47.930
<v Speaker 3>if you have all that money and you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>all that freedom,</v>

3344
02:20:48.080 --> 02:20:50.480
<v Speaker 3>why when you try to make the world a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit of a better place.</v>

3345
02:20:51.020 --> 02:20:52.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

3346
02:20:52.041 --> 02:20:54.350
<v Speaker 3>But I think that they can do it in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>different way.</v>

3347
02:20:54.351 --> 02:20:55.184
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

3348
02:20:55.190 --> 02:20:56.540
<v Speaker 3>the Koch brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3349
02:20:56.570 --> 02:21:01.040
<v Speaker 3>they're using their means to mold the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world the way they see it.</v>

3350
02:21:01.490 --> 02:21:03.230
<v Speaker 3>I think the people who really have </v>
<v Speaker 3>power,</v>

3351
02:21:03.231 --> 02:21:06.140
<v Speaker 3>they're like looking at the presence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that guy's a puppet,</v>

3352
02:21:06.350 --> 02:21:07.250
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3353
02:21:07.251 --> 02:21:10.370
<v Speaker 3>it's definitely been shown to be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>puppet more than once.</v>

3354
02:21:10.640 --> 02:21:11.473
<v Speaker 3>More than one different administration </v>
<v Speaker 3>has been shown to be completely at the </v>

3355
02:21:14.241 --> 02:21:16.640
<v Speaker 3>influence of the people that got them in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the office in the first place.</v>

3356
02:21:16.800 --> 02:21:18.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all disappointing,</v>

3357
02:21:18.320 --> 02:21:19.153
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that would all be wiped out of the </v>

3358
02:21:20.240 --> 02:21:23.390
<v Speaker 3>Annunaki showed up at a gigantic gold </v>
<v Speaker 3>disc came out,</v>

3359
02:21:23.391 --> 02:21:27.870
<v Speaker 3>levitating telling us how stupid we are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need the Annunaki to come from,</v>

3360
02:21:28.270 --> 02:21:30.740
<v Speaker 3>but we're going to be that someday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's my thought.</v>

3361
02:21:30.741 --> 02:21:31.530
<v Speaker 3>Captain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Save a hoe.</v>

3362
02:21:31.530 --> 02:21:34.100
<v Speaker 3>Save these.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's well,</v>

3363
02:21:34.101 --> 02:21:35.420
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would totally be captain.</v>

3364
02:21:35.421 --> 02:21:37.220
<v Speaker 3>Save a hoe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The rest of the other islands where like</v>

3365
02:21:37.221 --> 02:21:38.410
<v Speaker 3>pitch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing here?</v>

3366
02:21:38.430 --> 02:21:41.410
<v Speaker 3>Get the fuck off earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to earth these head,</v>

3367
02:21:41.420 --> 02:21:44.240
<v Speaker 3>this planet of the heroin addicts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you not watch TV,</v>

3368
02:21:44.360 --> 02:21:46.850
<v Speaker 3>have you not gone on earth and look at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the youtube comments.</v>

3369
02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:48.980
<v Speaker 3>They're fucking savages.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get out of there man.</v>

3370
02:21:49.550 --> 02:21:52.370
<v Speaker 3>They're going to eat you and fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lucky and not necessarily in that order.</v>

3371
02:21:55.390 --> 02:21:56.900
<v Speaker 3>They're going to come on your tits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bro.</v>

3372
02:21:56.990 --> 02:21:58.400
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>run.</v>

3373
02:21:58.640 --> 02:22:01.220
<v Speaker 3>They're going to come and your grandma's</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ted's get out.</v>

3374
02:22:01.280 --> 02:22:02.113
<v Speaker 3>Get out of that planet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If someone could be the first person to </v>

3375
02:22:03.871 --> 02:22:05.210
<v Speaker 3>fucking on and Aki,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3376
02:22:05.211 --> 02:22:07.070
<v Speaker 3>think that would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be a contest.</v>

3377
02:22:07.071 --> 02:22:07.904
<v Speaker 3>That'd be a radios.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Contests like morning zoos between </v>

3378
02:22:09.621 --> 02:22:12.150
<v Speaker 3>humans and our Nike's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a human fucking nine o'clock.</v>

3379
02:22:12.220 --> 02:22:14.000
<v Speaker 3>It would be the Annunaki fucking the </v>
<v Speaker 3>human.</v>

3380
02:22:14.090 --> 02:22:17.240
<v Speaker 3>You say that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what if it's is through a walmart,</v>

3381
02:22:17.300 --> 02:22:18.133
<v Speaker 3>clever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>crafty person and an on and Aki that's </v>

3382
02:22:20.991 --> 02:22:24.380
<v Speaker 3>been getting $30,000 a year and really </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't have any motivation.</v>

3383
02:22:24.710 --> 02:22:25.543
<v Speaker 3>And their weak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think even the shittiest out of knock </v>

3384
02:22:27.131 --> 02:22:30.810
<v Speaker 3>is going to fuck a human through a wall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used say that that brick wall,</v>

3385
02:22:30.990 --> 02:22:34.110
<v Speaker 3>you see that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but take one of the dumbest people today</v>

3386
02:22:34.260 --> 02:22:35.093
<v Speaker 3>and put them in a room with one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>smartest people from ancient Rome and </v>

3387
02:22:39.091 --> 02:22:42.180
<v Speaker 3>who would be running shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>smartest dude information Rome.</v>

3388
02:22:42.300 --> 02:22:42.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

3389
02:22:42.990 --> 02:22:43.823
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well don't you think that'd be the case </v>

3390
02:22:44.761 --> 02:22:48.150
<v Speaker 3>as far as like a advanced intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you get a really dump,</v>

3391
02:22:48.210 --> 02:22:50.910
<v Speaker 3>I mean unless they figured out a way to </v>
<v Speaker 3>eliminate stupidity,</v>

3392
02:22:51.720 --> 02:22:52.553
<v Speaker 3>which it seems like you're always going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to have conflict and resolution that </v>

3393
02:22:55.441 --> 02:22:57.300
<v Speaker 3>seems like what the universe is supposed</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be all about.</v>

3394
02:22:57.440 --> 02:22:58.273
<v Speaker 3>The universities all be all is about </v>
<v Speaker 3>problems and solutions for those </v>

3395
02:23:00.661 --> 02:23:01.494
<v Speaker 3>problems and that's how things advance </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's what the universe of of </v>

3396
02:23:04.771 --> 02:23:05.604
<v Speaker 3>thought is in this world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's always constant conflict and </v>

3397
02:23:08.820 --> 02:23:09.653
<v Speaker 3>resolution of that conflict and and </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to figure out how to never have </v>

3398
02:23:12.841 --> 02:23:13.674
<v Speaker 3>this conflict again and what's the best </v>
<v Speaker 3>way to get even natural disasters and </v>

3399
02:23:16.411 --> 02:23:18.450
<v Speaker 3>all these things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are opportunities to innovate,</v>

3400
02:23:18.520 --> 02:23:20.010
<v Speaker 3>are opportunities to figure out a way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

3401
02:23:20.160 --> 02:23:20.993
<v Speaker 3>we saw what happened in Fukushima,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do we get power and not have this </v>

3402
02:23:23.431 --> 02:23:24.264
<v Speaker 3>problem and what do we do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then all these minds converge and </v>

3403
02:23:26.511 --> 02:23:27.810
<v Speaker 3>they try to figure out solutions.</v>

3404
02:23:28.080 --> 02:23:29.730
<v Speaker 3>I think that's just always going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>the case.</v>

3405
02:23:29.760 --> 02:23:30.740
<v Speaker 3>I think that's always good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

3406
02:23:30.930 --> 02:23:35.580
<v Speaker 3>that's what causes things to improve is </v>
<v Speaker 3>this constant battle.</v>

3407
02:23:35.581 --> 02:23:38.790
<v Speaker 3>If everything was groovy and perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing would get done.</v>

3408
02:23:38.830 --> 02:23:39.663
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like you're always has to have </v>

3409
02:23:40.260 --> 02:23:40.951
<v Speaker 3>struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3410
02:23:40.951 --> 02:23:42.990
<v Speaker 3>There's a dilemma that always has to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>addressed,</v>

3411
02:23:43.050 --> 02:23:45.360
<v Speaker 3>which is still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gives you his dope.</v>

3412
02:23:45.810 --> 02:23:47.040
<v Speaker 3>We end on that.</v>
