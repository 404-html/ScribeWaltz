1
00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.020
That's the nighttime version of the monkey because the monkey that's just been

2
00:00:08.021 --> 00:00:13.021
up fucking and punching shit and eating fermented berries.

3
00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.210
That's the monkey is tired sucking all the monkey cock.

4
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.080
That's a tired monkey know

5
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.240
this but was of the Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by hover.

6
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:30.220
Uh,

7
00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.720
if you have not been to hover,

8
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:32.973
uh,

9
00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.550
I have actually I actually use it and I use it to register domain names.

10
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.220
Wish I was one of those dudes who got in on that action.

11
00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.260
Like when you get by business.com those wizards that made like a fucking family

12
00:00:47.261 --> 00:00:49.910
fortune of having the right name coke,

13
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.470
<v 1>I think it was really hard to do.</v>

14
00:00:51.471 --> 00:00:53.780
I did it and now I just have a bunch of domains.

15
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:54.021
I'm like,

16
00:00:54.021 --> 00:00:56.000
I don't even care if this is worth anything anymore.

17
00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:57.700
<v 0>How dare you say that?</v>

18
00:00:57.701 --> 00:00:58.540
Why don't you sell them?

19
00:00:58.541 --> 00:00:59.580
You fuck what's,

20
00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.711
what?

21
00:00:59.711 --> 00:01:00.730
Do you got the worth something?

22
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.201
<v 1>No,</v>

23
00:01:01.201 --> 00:01:04.800
I don't even know if they are like I have one that's Java lamps,

24
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:05.281
you know,

25
00:01:05.281 --> 00:01:05.810
I have

26
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.760
<v 0>Java lamps is worth something.</v>

27
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.620
Why would y'all want me start Kiwi,

28
00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:10.813
Mr Kiwi?

29
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.430
If there's a business called Mister Qe,

30
00:01:12.431 --> 00:01:13.060
they might be,

31
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.250
<v 1>it sounds like an apple juice in Japan,</v>

32
00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.820
you know?

33
00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:16.470
<v 0>Exactly.</v>

34
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.120
Yeah.

35
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.270
We're some sort of a fruit beverage.

36
00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.930
Yeah.

37
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.260
<v 1>I just got let go of a lot like pill humping.com</v>

38
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.440
<v 0>he'll humper pillow.</v>

39
00:01:24.441 --> 00:01:25.510
humper.com yeah.

40
00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:26.570
Boy that was a gold mine.

41
00:01:26.571 --> 00:01:27.610
You passed up on pal.

42
00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:29.940
The thing he got rid of those four.

43
00:01:29.941 --> 00:01:31.810
You hit 40 yeah,

44
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.580
I'm hover is a I've,

45
00:01:35.581 --> 00:01:36.414
I've used it.

46
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.520
I won't tell you what the domains are because if I have some controversial

47
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.140
domain out there and you're like,

48
00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.300
who is writing this crazy shit?

49
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.070
Maybe I don't want you to know.

50
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.560
<v 1>So you have a domain that you use that several,</v>

51
00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:49.740
no one that no one knows.

52
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.540
No one knows.

53
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.130
Not even meet cause you've never been told me about it.

54
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.450
<v 0>I have my own pet science projects.</v>

55
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.381
Oh my God.

56
00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:56.310
That's fucking hilarious.

57
00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.230
Dot Com forward slash.

58
00:01:58.231 --> 00:02:02.640
Rogan one of the beautiful things about hover is that you get free who is domain

59
00:02:02.641 --> 00:02:02.971
name?

60
00:02:02.971 --> 00:02:03.781
Registration.

61
00:02:03.781 --> 00:02:04.920
Privacy.

62
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.070
That means you could have Dick Party in my mouth.com,

63
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.550
which by the way we do when we registered it add hover.

64
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.820
Well it's cause if you wanted,

65
00:02:14.821 --> 00:02:15.654
you know,

66
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.260
people did not know that dig party in my mouth.com was your website.

67
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.550
I think that would make sense.

68
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:21.030
Damn.

69
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.950
I want to know what your yours is anyway.

70
00:02:22.951 --> 00:02:26.700
hover.com forward slash rug and go there and get 10% off your domain name

71
00:02:26.701 --> 00:02:27.480
registrations.

72
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.590
It's very easy to use.

73
00:02:28.591 --> 00:02:29.280
I am,

74
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.113
I uh,

75
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.690
I enjoy using the internet and I enjoy,

76
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:34.410
um,

77
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.560
going online and pulling information from the web.

78
00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:38.120
How?

79
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.953
However,

80
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.740
I quite honestly do not know much about how to work everything.

81
00:02:43.741 --> 00:02:45.270
I'm not that technologically savvy.

82
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:46.350
I'm just too fucking busy.

83
00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:47.281
But Hover,

84
00:02:47.281 --> 00:02:49.740
it's so easy.

85
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.630
It's so intuitive.

86
00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.880
There was a zero hassle of owning and managing domain names with it.

87
00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.290
Real user,

88
00:02:58.291 --> 00:02:59.250
the user interface,

89
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:00.520
very intuitive.

90
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.180
So I recommend them hover.com forward slash Rogen.

91
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.600
Yeah.

92
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.200
Fucks free.

93
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.750
Security also say it covers your address and everything.

94
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:10.210
Yeah,

95
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:11.110
that's what it was saying.

96
00:03:11.111 --> 00:03:11.560
Free.

97
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.420
Who is domain name security?

98
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.010
Um,

99
00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.060
shows coming up.

100
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.580
This.

101
00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:17.010
Uh,

102
00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.980
I'm at the Burton Cummings Theater in Winnipeg June 14th,

103
00:03:20.981 --> 00:03:22.120
but it's all that bitch.

104
00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.930
I'm,

105
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.830
I'm at the bear to theater pub and grill with Ari Shaffir,

106
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.610
uh,

107
00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:28.421
in Anchorage,

108
00:03:28.421 --> 00:03:29.254
Alaska.

109
00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.640
And this just went on sale today.

110
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.250
We're doing one night up there to do comedy,

111
00:03:33.251 --> 00:03:34.600
to pay for our fishing trip.

112
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:36.423
We're going to go fishing.

113
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:36.981
Uh,

114
00:03:36.981 --> 00:03:38.620
so that's June 26,

115
00:03:38.621 --> 00:03:39.850
2013.

116
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.290
I've been wanting to go to Alaska forever,

117
00:03:41.291 --> 00:03:41.531
man.

118
00:03:41.531 --> 00:03:42.364
I just want to see it.

119
00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.130
I just heard some saying I heard it just blows your mind.

120
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.980
Like you go up there and you just never look at each of the same.

121
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.873
You see,

122
00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.070
you see animals that you didn't know.

123
00:03:50.071 --> 00:03:50.860
Just,

124
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:51.131
yeah,

125
00:03:51.131 --> 00:03:52.150
my friends who've been there,

126
00:03:52.151 --> 00:03:52.510
like the,

127
00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:53.830
my hunter friends who had been there,

128
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:55.570
they say it's like you have to go there.

129
00:03:55.571 --> 00:03:58.570
You have to go there once in your life just to see this unexplored.

130
00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.100
Literally you,

131
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.250
you might go somewhere where humans never been like,

132
00:04:03.251 --> 00:04:04.280
it's possible to do that.

133
00:04:04.281 --> 00:04:08.320
It's telling Alaska like if you really want to get crazy and take a plane and

134
00:04:08.321 --> 00:04:10.330
fly two hours out and just land somewhere,

135
00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.090
it's very likely no one's ever been there.

136
00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.450
Like that's crazy.

137
00:04:13.451 --> 00:04:17.110
This has been a lot of God damn people on this planet for a long ass time.

138
00:04:17.111 --> 00:04:21.430
But it is possible that you could find a spot in Alaska where there's never been

139
00:04:21.431 --> 00:04:23.230
a human being where I'm going.

140
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.530
But you know what's the Alaskan women look like?

141
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.550
Like men like Alaska,

142
00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:29.140
both face.

143
00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.870
I'm sure there's a few hotties up there that just taking deck like it's going

144
00:04:31.871 --> 00:04:35.350
out of style because you have so much power if you're a woman up there.

145
00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.720
I think dude's just have to get used to toss and girls around.

146
00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.520
I bet a lot of guys fight over girls too up there.

147
00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.631
It's really bad.

148
00:04:40.631 --> 00:04:42.190
It's like 10 to one they ship 'em in.

149
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.630
They have to like that,

150
00:04:43.631 --> 00:04:45.220
like mail order stuff.

151
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.641
But yeah,

152
00:04:45.641 --> 00:04:46.451
there's a lot of that,

153
00:04:46.451 --> 00:04:49.020
but that's a commitment and the kind of girl that's willing to just pack up your

154
00:04:49.021 --> 00:04:50.560
shit and fly across the country.

155
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.270
Live with a crab fishermen.

156
00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:53.110
You know,

157
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:54.310
a lot of those bitches are crazy.

158
00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:55.331
Is this male?

159
00:04:55.331 --> 00:04:55.850
What do you know?

160
00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:57.550
Somebody that everyone there is crazy.

161
00:04:57.551 --> 00:04:58.410
They live in Alaska.

162
00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:59.650
I think it's awesome too.

163
00:04:59.651 --> 00:05:00.070
You know,

164
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.890
I really enjoy these shows that I've been watching and I'll watch like there's

165
00:05:02.891 --> 00:05:03.341
Alaska,

166
00:05:03.341 --> 00:05:07.240
the last frontier and mountain men and all these subsistence shows.

167
00:05:07.241 --> 00:05:08.620
I fucking love these shows,

168
00:05:08.621 --> 00:05:09.190
man.

169
00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:10.450
The people on Alaska,

170
00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:11.530
the last frontier,

171
00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.450
these are not stupid people.

172
00:05:13.451 --> 00:05:15.610
They are people who you would totally hang with.

173
00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.400
A young couple I did shows up that loved it,

174
00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:19.840
but every person I talked to,

175
00:05:19.841 --> 00:05:20.650
I'd be like,

176
00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:20.941
what?

177
00:05:20.941 --> 00:05:22.000
Why did you come to Alaska?

178
00:05:22.001 --> 00:05:22.691
And they'd go,

179
00:05:22.691 --> 00:05:23.524
uh,

180
00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:24.880
I love the outdoors.

181
00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.900
And I was like,

182
00:05:25.901 --> 00:05:27.310
there's outdoors in Florida.

183
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.570
You buried a body somewhere and it's not deep enough and you had to go somewhere

184
00:05:31.571 --> 00:05:32.800
they won't come to get you.

185
00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.290
I think people would still come to get you in Alaska.

186
00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.510
I don't think that's that safe.

187
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.790
If you're in the middle of a city like anchorage.

188
00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:40.331
When I went there,

189
00:05:40.331 --> 00:05:41.290
I went from New York,

190
00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.101
flew to Seattle,

191
00:05:42.101 --> 00:05:47.101
and I just figured it was like another hour from Seattle and like six hours

192
00:05:47.111 --> 00:05:47.801
later I was like,

193
00:05:47.801 --> 00:05:48.790
are you kidding me?

194
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.090
Like I didn't look at the map and figure out that like it's a far way away.

195
00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:54.303
Don't be rude dude.

196
00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:56.620
Alaskan women look like,

197
00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:57.280
yeah,

198
00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.113
come on man.

199
00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:58.700
Number four.

200
00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:59.533
It's personnel.

201
00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:00.480
Isn't that cool?

202
00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:00.980
That's not,

203
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:01.510
what does that mean?

204
00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:02.780
Cause she's a real human.

205
00:06:02.781 --> 00:06:03.680
And your Shanor what?

206
00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:04.563
She has a hot redhead.

207
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.660
How was she the number fourth good looking woman.

208
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.580
I don't have it in order to do seven man.

209
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.851
Yeah,

210
00:06:13.851 --> 00:06:15.260
this is order of popularity.

211
00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.860
No,

212
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.510
it's just what Google pops up.

213
00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:18.740
You should use being there.

214
00:06:18.741 --> 00:06:19.730
Less biased.

215
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.481
No,

216
00:06:20.481 --> 00:06:21.200
it's not.

217
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.471
Um,

218
00:06:21.471 --> 00:06:21.891
so anyway,

219
00:06:21.891 --> 00:06:23.300
Alaska bear tooth theater,

220
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:25.730
pub and Grill Anchorage,

221
00:06:25.731 --> 00:06:26.564
Alaska.

222
00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.150
Take these girls' pictures down too,

223
00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:29.390
please.

224
00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:30.223
Thank you.

225
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:31.700
Um,

226
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:32.870
also at the joint,

227
00:06:32.871 --> 00:06:33.900
at the hard rock,

228
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:35.030
July 6th,

229
00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:37.130
I'm with Joey Diaz.

230
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.300
So that's,

231
00:06:38.301 --> 00:06:38.720
um,

232
00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:43.720
the night before the UFC does a UFC on July 7th,

233
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:44.181
no,

234
00:06:44.181 --> 00:06:46.640
sixth you have C's on the six my shows in the fifth.

235
00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:47.901
So Friday,

236
00:06:47.901 --> 00:06:51.860
July 5th at the hard rock at the joint should be a lot of fun.

237
00:06:51.861 --> 00:06:52.760
I've never done that place.

238
00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:54.470
I've been there for UFC fights before,

239
00:06:54.471 --> 00:06:58.340
but I've never done stand up there is that in Vegas is made for it.

240
00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:02.810
And then the more theater in Seattle on July 26th,

241
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:03.320
this,

242
00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.280
some other shit coming up.

243
00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.750
But go to Joe rogan.net.

244
00:07:05.751 --> 00:07:09.110
Click on the tour thing and you could find it all there were also brought to as

245
00:07:09.111 --> 00:07:11.960
always by Ana [inaudible] Dot Com that S.

246
00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:11.960
O.

247
00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:12.291
N n.

248
00:07:12.291 --> 00:07:12.501
I.

249
00:07:12.501 --> 00:07:14.360
T if you've heard this commercial before,

250
00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:15.440
I'm so sorry,

251
00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:16.640
but there's nothing I can do.

252
00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:18.560
I have to just keep saying it.

253
00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:20.540
There's no new way to say it.

254
00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:21.591
What is on it?

255
00:07:21.591 --> 00:07:22.910
So human performance site,

256
00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:23.511
uh,

257
00:07:23.511 --> 00:07:27.770
we sell foods and supplements and fitness equipment and uh,

258
00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:29.060
exercise DVDs,

259
00:07:29.061 --> 00:07:31.730
all stuff that we approved that we enjoy,

260
00:07:31.731 --> 00:07:35.510
stuff that I feel is beneficial for fitness,

261
00:07:35.511 --> 00:07:39.830
for your strength and conditioning for your mental clarity,

262
00:07:39.831 --> 00:07:41.780
for even new mood,

263
00:07:41.781 --> 00:07:43.430
which actually boosts your mood,

264
00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:46.730
elevates your serotonin levels healthy and natural.

265
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:47.370
But you know,

266
00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:50.810
I was supposed to take it if you're on an Ssri eyes because that's Sris

267
00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.350
essentially do a chemical version of the same idea.

268
00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:54.730
They,

269
00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:56.200
they boost your,

270
00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:56.740
your,

271
00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:58.820
your chemicals in your brain and new mood,

272
00:07:58.870 --> 00:07:59.150
uh,

273
00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:00.050
can do it naturally.

274
00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:01.460
But I don't know what you need.

275
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.020
If your doctor's got you on some shit,

276
00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:05.420
you either either that's good,

277
00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:08.330
it may very well be good or you,

278
00:08:08.331 --> 00:08:10.220
maybe you should try to do it naturally.

279
00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:11.090
Either one,

280
00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:12.560
you would have to know that not me,

281
00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:13.880
you might need it.

282
00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:15.170
I really have no idea.

283
00:08:15.171 --> 00:08:19.730
I've met people that absolutely need antidepressants and they've used it and

284
00:08:19.731 --> 00:08:21.560
it's changed their life and made them happy.

285
00:08:21.561 --> 00:08:22.550
So I would never say,

286
00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:24.770
but I'm addicted to this one.

287
00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:25.180
It's great.

288
00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:26.420
Sam Friend Molly.

289
00:08:26.421 --> 00:08:27.254
Awesome.

290
00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:28.430
This stuff is good.

291
00:08:28.431 --> 00:08:29.600
If you have a friend named Molly,

292
00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:31.310
cause that bitch will fuck your brain,

293
00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:32.480
drain it dry.

294
00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:33.430
And people are like,

295
00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:34.161
who's this Molly,

296
00:08:34.161 --> 00:08:38.180
you're talking so mean about all these people must know Molly real.

297
00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:39.410
They're all people that enjoy,

298
00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:39.860
um,

299
00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:40.790
mood supplements.

300
00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:44.090
The mood supplements are all,

301
00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:44.953
um,

302
00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:45.620
you know,

303
00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:50.620
five HTP is all been proven to elevate your serotonin levels and it makes you a,

304
00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:52.323
makes you feel better.

305
00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:54.710
So it's not subtle either.

306
00:08:55.010 --> 00:09:00.010
I find it's pretty obvious when I tell you that five HTP of FFT first found out

307
00:09:00.371 --> 00:09:03.340
about it because of Neil Brennan told me he's taking like a fucking ridiculous

308
00:09:03.341 --> 00:09:05.860
amounts of it and he was calling off and uh,

309
00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:09.340
I don't know if he does it anymore because I think he's on some other stuff too.

310
00:09:09.341 --> 00:09:11.590
And you're not supposed to do both of them at the same time.

311
00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:12.460
Uh,

312
00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:12.761
but,

313
00:09:12.761 --> 00:09:13.480
uh,

314
00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:14.320
it's uh,

315
00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:15.430
it's interesting stuff.

316
00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:16.121
Look into it though.

317
00:09:16.121 --> 00:09:16.751
Like always,

318
00:09:16.751 --> 00:09:17.081
if you,

319
00:09:17.081 --> 00:09:20.680
if you're interested in taking any sort of supplement that boost this or jacks

320
00:09:20.681 --> 00:09:22.630
up dad or any of that stuff,

321
00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:24.880
look into it because there's controversy behind it,

322
00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:25.540
you know?

323
00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:25.840
Um,

324
00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:28.400
but I can tell you that everything that we have on on it,

325
00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:33.420
it's something that either I use or would use or I buy or something that I feel

326
00:09:33.461 --> 00:09:34.294
is beneficial.

327
00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:35.710
So that's on a.com.

328
00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.930
Use the code named Rogan Seniors' housing money.

329
00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:38.590
All right.

330
00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:40.000
Still going to do the Kale shakes.

331
00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:40.811
Erica,

332
00:09:40.811 --> 00:09:41.620
did you take one a day?

333
00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:42.550
I did not take one,

334
00:09:42.551 --> 00:09:42.911
but I,

335
00:09:42.911 --> 00:09:45.160
you know what he said is if I take it with calcium,

336
00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:46.180
he said it kills.

337
00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:46.710
No,

338
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:46.930
no,

339
00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:47.001
no,

340
00:09:47.001 --> 00:09:47.290
no.

341
00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:48.640
You said even if you just,

342
00:09:48.641 --> 00:09:49.181
if it's raw,

343
00:09:49.181 --> 00:09:50.140
as long as that's calcium,

344
00:09:50.141 --> 00:09:51.820
it keeps out of this stuff from affecting your body.

345
00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:54.580
But he recommends it for cooking for a couple of reasons.

346
00:09:54.581 --> 00:09:54.881
One,

347
00:09:54.881 --> 00:09:56.770
because it kills even more and two,

348
00:09:56.771 --> 00:09:58.530
because it makes it more bioavailable.

349
00:09:58.780 --> 00:09:59.441
I still have to,

350
00:09:59.441 --> 00:09:59.771
you know,

351
00:09:59.771 --> 00:10:00.970
I believe him,

352
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.500
but I still have to look into it myself.

353
00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:02.740
All right.

354
00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:06.700
I've heard so many people say great things about the benefits of cal shakes,

355
00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:10.660
but I also heard what you talked about that one time about the bacteria,

356
00:10:10.661 --> 00:10:11.620
like a fungal growth.

357
00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:13.720
Similar to what he was talking about with microtoxins.

358
00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:15.520
I ate tons of Kale.

359
00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:16.443
I do too.

360
00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:17.021
I do too.

361
00:10:17.021 --> 00:10:17.261
I do.

362
00:10:17.261 --> 00:10:17.861
I drink it.

363
00:10:17.861 --> 00:10:19.960
I drink Kale shakes because I can,

364
00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:21.160
I'm not going to eat that much.

365
00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:22.810
There's no way I'm going to eat a giant,

366
00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:23.381
you know,

367
00:10:23.381 --> 00:10:25.180
30 ounce fucking,

368
00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:27.400
I mean if you stack them in a bowl,

369
00:10:27.401 --> 00:10:28.570
I'm not chewing all that shit down.

370
00:10:28.571 --> 00:10:28.931
I do.

371
00:10:28.931 --> 00:10:33.931
I eat Kale Salads blended down though the amount is massive with cucumber and I

372
00:10:34.171 --> 00:10:36.340
use raw ginger and raw garlic and it just,

373
00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:37.530
boom,

374
00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:41.080
it just stuck an ass kicking bursts of nutrients.

375
00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:41.531
But,

376
00:10:41.531 --> 00:10:41.710
uh,

377
00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:45.100
Dave Asprey was talking about the potential,

378
00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:50.530
the potential downsides of eating a massive amount of Kale that it has.

379
00:10:50.531 --> 00:10:51.190
Um,

380
00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:55.480
it actually has a type of acid in it that is designed to keep it from being

381
00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:58.600
eaten by things to discourage predation,

382
00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:00.250
which kind of makes sense,

383
00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:01.480
but I have to read into it.

384
00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:02.270
So go,

385
00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:05.890
go to bulletproof exec.com a lot of people think that guys always trying to make

386
00:11:05.891 --> 00:11:06.340
money.

387
00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:08.500
He has so much shit online for free.

388
00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:09.340
It's ridiculous.

389
00:11:09.341 --> 00:11:09.581
His,

390
00:11:09.581 --> 00:11:12.460
his website has hundreds of thousands,

391
00:11:12.461 --> 00:11:13.720
a little things on it for free.

392
00:11:13.721 --> 00:11:18.190
And he's had it up for years before he started making his own coffee and selling

393
00:11:18.191 --> 00:11:19.120
it and all that other stuff.

394
00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:19.691
But uh,

395
00:11:19.691 --> 00:11:23.200
he wrote something about upgrading the Kale shake.

396
00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:24.580
And so if you're any kale shakes,

397
00:11:24.581 --> 00:11:27.700
he should read that because it's scientifically very fascinating.

398
00:11:27.701 --> 00:11:27.940
I just,

399
00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:31.720
I have to read it and then read the opposing and you know how it is.

400
00:11:31.721 --> 00:11:33.010
You've got to look into that shit.

401
00:11:33.011 --> 00:11:33.820
Yo.

402
00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:34.361
Uh,

403
00:11:34.361 --> 00:11:34.760
that's it.

404
00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:37.180
If Fox Eddie FTC or you might know him,

405
00:11:37.181 --> 00:11:38.014
you might not,

406
00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:40.480
you might be in love with them,

407
00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.480
but we're going to talk some shit and we're gonna,

408
00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:44.920
we're gonna get to the bottom of things.

409
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:48.490
<v 2>Okay.</v>

410
00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:50.200
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience,</v>

411
00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:54.120
<v 2>Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.</v>

412
00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:56.333
<v 3>Boom,</v>

413
00:11:57.330 --> 00:11:58.163
<v 0>boom.</v>

414
00:11:58.530 --> 00:11:59.400
That's what I'm saying,

415
00:11:59.401 --> 00:11:59.910
buddy.

416
00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:00.743
Boom.

417
00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:03.240
I'm fucking groovy.

418
00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:05.453
How are you doing?

419
00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:06.503
Doing good.

420
00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:07.433
Every now and then.

421
00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:11.310
I need to see something online to let me feel.

422
00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:12.050
I feel like I'm,

423
00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:12.883
I'm okay.

424
00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:13.291
But you know,

425
00:12:13.291 --> 00:12:16.260
you get a little self critical and then you read about someone online.

426
00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:20.400
This might be one of the wackiest fucking things anybody's ever sat me.

427
00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:23.040
This dude is on National Geographic Taboo.

428
00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:26.370
It's a fake paraplegic who,

429
00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:26.910
uh,

430
00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:28.740
he used to be a woman.

431
00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:30.570
I used to be a man rather,

432
00:12:30.571 --> 00:12:33.570
and then became a woman and then fake being a paraplegic.

433
00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:35.963
Wow.

434
00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:36.990
Yeah.

435
00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:37.740
Wow.

436
00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:38.573
What?

437
00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.020
Wow.

438
00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:43.340
She had a secret and the secret was that she's a fake paraplegic.

439
00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:47.010
She went around in a wheelchair pretending to have a spinal cord injury fooling

440
00:12:47.011 --> 00:12:47.844
everyone.

441
00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:51.930
<v 3>You think you know weird people in your life,</v>

442
00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:55.230
and then you read about these randoms that it's like,

443
00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:58.200
that's beyond anything that craziest,

444
00:12:58.201 --> 00:12:59.300
weirdest people I know

445
00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:00.680
<v 0>couldn't comprehend.</v>

446
00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:01.850
She's not a dummy.

447
00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:03.230
She's a fucking phd.

448
00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:04.430
She's a chemist.

449
00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:08.810
She lives in Salt Lake City and a used to be a man.

450
00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:09.200
Right.

451
00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:13.010
You decided to become a woman and then decided to fake that she was paralyzed.

452
00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:14.810
Macy's doing experiments.

453
00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:16.070
I don't think so.

454
00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:18.530
You can't put those two things in the same category though.

455
00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:19.521
You know,

456
00:13:19.521 --> 00:13:20.354
like,

457
00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:21.283
I don't know.

458
00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:25.010
She could have made herself a paraplegic if she wanted to.

459
00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:26.660
She was molested by a goldfish.

460
00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:28.993
Was

461
00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:32.330
you just say everything that comes to your mind,

462
00:13:32.331 --> 00:13:32.690
man.

463
00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:33.523
Really?

464
00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:34.211
Why does it,

465
00:13:34.211 --> 00:13:37.230
why was thinking of like goldfish would make you pretend to be parallel?

466
00:13:37.231 --> 00:13:38.390
I was thinking like what would,

467
00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.970
who would molest you to do something crazy like that?

468
00:13:40.971 --> 00:13:41.221
You know,

469
00:13:41.221 --> 00:13:42.054
like I always,

470
00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:44.690
I think always think it comes back to being molested from some,

471
00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:45.703
for the most part,

472
00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:47.160
people act crazy.

473
00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:48.863
Yeah,

474
00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:49.981
<v 3>it does.</v>

475
00:13:49.981 --> 00:13:51.190
A lot of times you hear that,

476
00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:52.590
that it's usually sexual.

477
00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:53.430
Yeah.

478
00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:54.211
I've been molested.

479
00:13:54.211 --> 00:13:56.880
Don't they usually act out in a sexual way as a lot of different things.

480
00:13:56.881 --> 00:13:59.990
Like borderline personality disorder that comes from getting that comes from is

481
00:13:59.991 --> 00:14:00.290
actually,

482
00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:01.440
it'd be a lot of times.

483
00:14:01.441 --> 00:14:02.274
Yeah.

484
00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:07.410
And boy had a friend who love dating girls who had been abused because he said

485
00:14:07.411 --> 00:14:08.790
there were always the craziest in bed.

486
00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:09.893
I used to have a bit about it.

487
00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:10.230
I said,

488
00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:11.910
when you have sex with like a really,

489
00:14:11.911 --> 00:14:14.130
really like a girl that's just so good and bad,

490
00:14:14.131 --> 00:14:14.964
I go,

491
00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:15.811
all I want to do,

492
00:14:15.811 --> 00:14:16.200
I go,

493
00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:17.280
I want to enjoy it,

494
00:14:17.281 --> 00:14:18.360
but I just want to say like,

495
00:14:18.361 --> 00:14:20.340
which uncle do I have to thank for this?

496
00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:21.930
Because it,

497
00:14:21.931 --> 00:14:22.140
no,

498
00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:26.370
there is this like sometimes like the craziest,

499
00:14:26.371 --> 00:14:27.031
craziest,

500
00:14:27.031 --> 00:14:28.030
best sex you've ever had.

501
00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:32.490
But I had sex with a chick who,

502
00:14:32.491 --> 00:14:32.910
uh,

503
00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:36.080
it was the craziest sex I ever had in my life and she was a squirter.

504
00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:36.923
She was like,

505
00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:38.280

506
00:14:38.281 --> 00:14:39.114

00:14:43.141 --> 00:14:43.980
Fuck me harder.

511
00:14:43.981 --> 00:14:44.814
And I went,

512
00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:46.590
I'm fucking you as hard as I can.

513
00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:51.860
And then she swatted me across the face like hard and I just

514
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:52.430

529
00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:11.090
And we started talking in the next thing,

530
00:15:11.091 --> 00:15:11.361
you know,

531
00:15:11.361 --> 00:15:16.361
her grandfather molested her and all this stuff and she became a prostitute.

532
00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:18.000
Yeah.

533
00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:19.640
Well after me,

534

535
00:15:22.911 --> 00:15:23.270
I've said,

536
00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:24.740
I've said two girls to prostitute.

537
00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:25.800
Oh my God,

538
00:15:25.801 --> 00:15:25.901

539
00:15:25.901 --> 00:15:26.360
Number.

540
00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:29.630
I think I sent them a one chick.

541
00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:30.523
Uh,

542
00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:34.730
I just dated her for a while and then years later we remained friends and she

543
00:15:34.731 --> 00:15:35.330
was hot,

544
00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:36.710
so hot model,

545
00:15:36.711 --> 00:15:38.300
like smoking hot.

546
00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:40.100
And she calls me and she goes,

547
00:15:40.101 --> 00:15:40.840
uh,

548
00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:41.300
uh,

549
00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:43.130
like probably the hottest girl I ever did it.

550
00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:43.791
And she goes,

551
00:15:43.791 --> 00:15:44.624
um,

552
00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:46.131
I was in New York,

553
00:15:46.131 --> 00:15:46.641
let's get together,

554
00:15:46.641 --> 00:15:47.210
let's have a drink.

555
00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:49.220
Just friends because it was over and,

556
00:15:49.221 --> 00:15:50.054
uh,

557
00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:50.841
having a drink.

558
00:15:50.841 --> 00:15:51.651
And she said,

559
00:15:51.651 --> 00:15:51.861
I said,

560
00:15:51.861 --> 00:15:52.970
I'm looking for a place in New York,

561
00:15:52.971 --> 00:15:54.020
like a room to rent,

562
00:15:54.021 --> 00:15:55.880
just cause I'd go back and forth from La to New York.

563
00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:56.391
She goes,

564
00:15:56.391 --> 00:15:57.230
why don't you come live with me?

565
00:15:57.231 --> 00:15:57.580
And I'm like,

566
00:15:57.580 --> 00:15:57.921
ah,

567
00:15:57.921 --> 00:15:59.030
I don't want to share a room with you.

568
00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.530
And I thought I did done that.

569
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:00.981
She didn't know.

570
00:16:00.981 --> 00:16:01.761
I got a two bedroom.

571
00:16:01.761 --> 00:16:03.290
I go where she gets 57th street.

572
00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:04.041
I'm like,

573
00:16:04.041 --> 00:16:05.720
who lives on 57th street?

574
00:16:05.721 --> 00:16:06.810
Like that's like,

575
00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:07.281
you know,

576
00:16:07.281 --> 00:16:08.510
like serious real estate.

577
00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:09.700
I can wait.

578
00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:11.300
You're always getting kicked out of the country.

579
00:16:11.301 --> 00:16:11.991
You have no money.

580
00:16:11.991 --> 00:16:12.801
Which she goes,

581
00:16:12.801 --> 00:16:14.210
I got 90 grand in the bank.

582
00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:14.571
I go,

583
00:16:14.571 --> 00:16:15.081
what'd you get?

584
00:16:15.081 --> 00:16:15.980
90 grand.

585
00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:17.001
She goes,

586
00:16:17.001 --> 00:16:17.834
um,

587
00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:19.550
this other model I know said,

588
00:16:19.551 --> 00:16:19.731
hey,

589
00:16:19.731 --> 00:16:21.500
you want to go to Miami for the weekend?

590
00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:22.071
She goes,

591
00:16:22.071 --> 00:16:22.611
went down.

592
00:16:22.611 --> 00:16:23.720
We partied with these guys,

593
00:16:23.721 --> 00:16:24.890
we did coke all night.

594
00:16:24.891 --> 00:16:25.671
And she goes,

595
00:16:25.671 --> 00:16:26.630
I fooled around with her.

596
00:16:26.631 --> 00:16:27.960
I fooled around with both dude,

597
00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:28.490
you know,

598
00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:30.710
went home and there's 25 grand in my bank account.

599
00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:32.890
I'm like 25 grand off.

600
00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:34.010
I'll look for that.

601
00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:37.010
25 grand.

602
00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:37.820
Wow.

603
00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:41.210
For a weekend and must be nice to be like a billionaire ball or dude who could

604
00:16:41.211 --> 00:16:46.211
just order up some $25,000 girls 25 grand for a weekend.

605
00:16:47.211 --> 00:16:48.044
They've had.

606
00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.750
<v 0>This is Bali where with us at Miami,</v>

607
00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:53.110
those girls that go into that one country,

608
00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:58.130
wherever sex and the city was uh oh you buy so many girls that I've turned down

609
00:16:58.451 --> 00:17:02.010
the $25,000 offer from some king that just like just goes,

610
00:17:02.011 --> 00:17:04.270
it hits all the ladies like 25,000 week,

611
00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:05.133
you know,

612
00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:05.531
in there.

613
00:17:05.531 --> 00:17:07.540
But I know so many people that have turned it down,

614
00:17:07.541 --> 00:17:11.920
but I also know a couple girls that have done it and that's his fucking crazy.

615
00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:13.870
I think there's quite a few of those guys out there.

616
00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:17.500
Well I've been to Dubai a number of times and there's $50 ones.

617
00:17:17.501 --> 00:17:19.990
They're $50 for a prostitute.

618
00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:20.381
Yeah,

619
00:17:20.381 --> 00:17:23.860
but what I'm saying is that these guys that get girls from America and have them

620
00:17:23.861 --> 00:17:24.281
shipped,

621
00:17:24.281 --> 00:17:24.671
oh yeah.

622
00:17:24.671 --> 00:17:25.870
That to me that's crazy shit.

623
00:17:26.110 --> 00:17:27.010
That kind of money.

624
00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:27.820
That's a way,

625
00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:28.960
this is a weird reality.

626
00:17:28.961 --> 00:17:29.201
You know,

627
00:17:29.201 --> 00:17:30.790
when you have like trillions of dollars,

628
00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:32.260
like there's people who are like,

629
00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:35.050
I think as far as private wealth is concerned,

630
00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.750
like what we know and you see like the richest man in the world,

631
00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:38.500
man,

632
00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:39.333
not really.

633
00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:39.941
Okay.

634
00:17:39.941 --> 00:17:43.450
Because what you're getting is the richest man in the world who has assets that

635
00:17:43.451 --> 00:17:44.110
are measurable,

636
00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:45.280
like in the stock market.

637
00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:47.140
When you're dealing with canes,

638
00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.980
you don't have any fucking idea how much those guys

639
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:50.460
<v 5>have.</v>

640
00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:51.031
You don't know.

641
00:17:51.031 --> 00:17:51.900
Why should you know?

642
00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:53.020
I got a buddy who is,

643
00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:53.760
have a bank.

644
00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:55.060
I got a buddy who was a billionaire,

645
00:17:55.061 --> 00:17:57.630
a real live billionaire and uh,

646
00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.340
never knew he had money for years.

647
00:17:59.341 --> 00:17:59.791
He was just,

648
00:17:59.791 --> 00:18:00.210
um,

649
00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:01.890
my friend's friend and uh,

650
00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:02.500
never knew.

651
00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:03.840
We hung out in New York and everything.

652
00:18:03.841 --> 00:18:06.900
And then one day I was reading about his family and the newspaper and then went,

653
00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:09.030
Holy Fuck.

654
00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:10.300
And I called him on the phone,

655
00:18:10.301 --> 00:18:10.471
I'm like,

656
00:18:10.471 --> 00:18:11.230
you have money?

657
00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:11.551
He's like,

658
00:18:11.551 --> 00:18:11.671
yeah.

659
00:18:11.671 --> 00:18:11.881
I'm like,

660
00:18:11.881 --> 00:18:12.031
no,

661
00:18:12.031 --> 00:18:12.181
no,

662
00:18:12.181 --> 00:18:12.810
no.

663
00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:16.290
You have like fucking money.

664
00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:17.323
Family does.

665
00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:17.941
Yeah.

666
00:18:17.941 --> 00:18:18.571
And I said,

667
00:18:18.571 --> 00:18:19.500
this is bullshit.

668
00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:21.780
We have never gotten to take advantage of this.

669
00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:22.651
I said,

670
00:18:22.651 --> 00:18:25.200
you have like crazy fuck you money.

671
00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:30.420
So years later he came into the money like where it was his,

672
00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:31.021
oh,

673
00:18:31.021 --> 00:18:31.771
that's so creepy.

674
00:18:31.771 --> 00:18:34.350
Just sitting around lazy waiting for it to happen.

675
00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.330
We worked hard,

676
00:18:36.331 --> 00:18:36.480
but,

677
00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:37.650
but someone did die.

678
00:18:37.651 --> 00:18:39.390
I don't want to give away who we possibly is,

679
00:18:39.391 --> 00:18:40.080
but okay.

680
00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:44.760
But in one year he went from fucking Zenith,

681
00:18:44.761 --> 00:18:45.270
the Nadir,

682
00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:46.103
like he,

683
00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:51.590
he straight to rehab like a year and a year from when he like took over the

684
00:18:52.471 --> 00:18:53.400
money too.

685
00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:54.180
He was,

686
00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:55.110
he would call me and be like,

687
00:18:55.111 --> 00:18:55.890
I'm in Vegas.

688
00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:57.510
I got the top floor of the wind rented.

689
00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:59.700
I got slip and slides down the hallway.

690
00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:00.360
There's,

691
00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:02.310
there's strippers and hookers everywhere.

692
00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:06.570
And we got midgets in a storm trooper outfit serving the strengths and he'd be

693
00:19:06.571 --> 00:19:06.870
like,

694
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:08.220
I'll have a private jet picking you up.

695
00:19:08.221 --> 00:19:10.830
Get here now how much money did he inherit?

696
00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:11.810
Uh,

697
00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:12.930
about $5 billion.

698
00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:13.873
Ooh.

699
00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:16.470
Oh my goodness.

700
00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:18.541
Oh my goodness.

701
00:19:18.541 --> 00:19:19.530
And he's not fun anymore.

702
00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:22.290
He's not fun anymore.

703
00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:24.600
That's a complete ball changer.

704
00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:26.370
God Damn,

705
00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:27.060
he's not fun.

706
00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:28.020
$5 billion.

707
00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:29.640
That's the one guy that I,

708
00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:32.160
not fun because the rehab kind of killed it.

709
00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:32.650
Killed?

710
00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:32.821
No,

711
00:19:32.821 --> 00:19:34.590
he only needed a year before we went into Rehab.

712
00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:34.950
Yup.

713
00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:35.461
Wow.

714
00:19:35.461 --> 00:19:36.294
That's hilarious.

715
00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:37.770
And what was it for coke?

716
00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:39.930
He was smoking crack.

717
00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:41.160
Oh,

718
00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:41.941
but the merits run.

719
00:19:41.941 --> 00:19:44.100
So have you seen that shit?

720
00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:47.280
I'm seeing the mayor of Toronto got busted smoking crack.

721
00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:48.750
It's a lariat stuff.

722
00:19:48.751 --> 00:19:50.100
Pictures of them smoking crack.

723
00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:52.320
He took pictures of people I was smoking crack.

724
00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:53.790
The mayor of Toronto,

725
00:19:53.791 --> 00:19:54.960
apparently he's a hoot.

726
00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:56.790
He's just a fucking wild man.

727
00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:59.700
And he's out there like in the hood smoking crack.

728
00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:01.883
The mayor,

729
00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:04.880
Mayor Barry's from DC was smoking and asked,

730
00:20:04.881 --> 00:20:06.930
this guy feels like if Marion Barry can do it,

731
00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:07.351
why can't I?

732
00:20:07.351 --> 00:20:08.184
Why can't I do it?

733
00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:09.023
I never,

734
00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:09.410
uh,

735
00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:09.630
I,

736
00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:10.010
my,

737
00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:14.640
my old partner on my radio show in New York would smoke crack and Jesus,

738
00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:16.590
and I heard it when I joined the show.

739
00:20:16.591 --> 00:20:17.131
They were like,

740
00:20:17.131 --> 00:20:18.180
don't hang out with them.

741
00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:19.260
Don't lend them money.

742
00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:20.200
Oh my God.

743
00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:22.160
They knew this and he was on the air.

744
00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:23.310
Totally functioning,

745
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:24.263
functioning,

746
00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:25.350
and we would,

747
00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:27.270
he would party hard anyway.

748
00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:28.470
He had a gambling problem.

749
00:20:28.471 --> 00:20:29.610
He still on the radio now.

750
00:20:29.611 --> 00:20:30.361
I don't want to say his name,

751
00:20:30.361 --> 00:20:31.194
but Artie Lange.

752
00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:31.680
No,

753
00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:32.513
but uh,

754
00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:33.610
but uh,

755
00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:33.850
I,

756
00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:35.790
I'm pretty sure it's well known so I'm not,

757
00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:39.630
I'm not saying anything just in case on a Duci no,

758
00:20:39.631 --> 00:20:40.464
but anyway,

759
00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:43.140
he won the first day.

760
00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:44.980
You see that picture of the Mayor Smoking crack.

761
00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:46.560
First day we went to,

762
00:20:46.561 --> 00:20:47.170
uh,

763
00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:48.700
we went to Mcdonald's to get lunch,

764
00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:49.120
right.

765
00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:52.240
First Day on the air and he starts talking to me about comedy and he's like,

766
00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:52.630
hey,

767
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:53.680
you make money doing comedy?

768
00:20:53.681 --> 00:20:53.980
I'm like,

769
00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:54.221
ah,

770
00:20:54.221 --> 00:20:54.401
yeah,

771
00:20:54.401 --> 00:20:55.000
I don't know.

772
00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:55.833
And he's like,

773
00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:56.950
can you lend me some money?

774
00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:58.000
First Day?

775
00:20:58.360 --> 00:20:59.230
Oh my God,

776
00:20:59.231 --> 00:21:00.760
so you lend me some money.

777
00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:03.910
So then one night he never came to my shows or anything.

778
00:21:03.911 --> 00:21:05.320
One night he came to a show at standup,

779
00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:09.580
New York comes to the show and he's at my show and I have to do like three shows

780
00:21:09.581 --> 00:21:11.170
there after the first show.

781
00:21:11.171 --> 00:21:11.591
He's like,

782
00:21:11.591 --> 00:21:12.250
all excited,

783
00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:12.401
oh,

784
00:21:12.401 --> 00:21:13.630
this is fucking great boat.

785
00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:14.111
He goes,

786
00:21:14.111 --> 00:21:14.800
let's go out,

787
00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:15.400
let's go.

788
00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:16.151
We're going to go out.

789
00:21:16.151 --> 00:21:16.631
And I'm like,

790
00:21:16.631 --> 00:21:17.800
I should probably stick around here.

791
00:21:17.801 --> 00:21:18.011
It's like,

792
00:21:18.011 --> 00:21:18.161
no,

793
00:21:18.161 --> 00:21:18.431
come on,

794
00:21:18.431 --> 00:21:19.010
we're going to go party.

795
00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:19.843
We'll come back.

796
00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:20.830
Who's that voice you're doing?

797
00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:22.030
I'm not telling you who he is,

798
00:21:22.031 --> 00:21:25.660
but he left and I never saw him again that night.

799
00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:27.910
And we heard a story ended up like in the bus day,

800
00:21:27.911 --> 00:21:28.840
he was buying crack.

801
00:21:28.841 --> 00:21:29.770
He was in a bus station,

802
00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:33.440
but he's been fired from every radio station and a

803
00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:37.420
fucking crack crack.

804
00:21:37.421 --> 00:21:38.860
Who doesn't get out of that?

805
00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:39.551
If you hadn't money,

806
00:21:39.551 --> 00:21:41.200
why wouldn't you just go straight to the good shit?

807
00:21:41.201 --> 00:21:42.550
Why would you go to like the Shitty job?

808
00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:45.450
I asked my friend and he said he just ate.

809
00:21:45.451 --> 00:21:46.750
It was such a bad thing for him.

810
00:21:46.751 --> 00:21:48.610
He couldn't say no to anything.

811
00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:49.960
So when you're around drugs,

812
00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:52.120
everything just starts coming around like he would go,

813
00:21:52.121 --> 00:21:52.870
okay,

814
00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:53.620
I'll try that.

815
00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:54.250
I'll try that.

816
00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:54.671
I'll try that.

817
00:21:54.671 --> 00:21:56.410
Was this when you want sports guys?

818
00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:01.000
New Morning Dick Sports guys.

819
00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:02.050
You're a dick.

820
00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:03.930
Well you're the one that's telling me it's in the fall.

821
00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:04.781
You were being very,

822
00:22:04.781 --> 00:22:06.900
did a bunch of radio though and you,

823
00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:07.721
how dare you?

824
00:22:07.721 --> 00:22:09.200
That's exactly what the fuck it is.

825
00:22:09.201 --> 00:22:10.090
You son of a bitch.

826
00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:11.470
We won't say the dude's name.

827
00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:12.670
That's where you're trying to avoid.

828
00:22:12.671 --> 00:22:13.240
Yeah,

829
00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:14.860
I just needed to know weirdly,

830
00:22:14.861 --> 00:22:16.210
haven't spoken to him since then.

831
00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:17.400
Where now it seems,

832
00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:17.560
no,

833
00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:18.400
I talked to him.

834
00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:20.290
I talked to him this week because he looked like,

835
00:22:20.291 --> 00:22:21.410
when Joe like this picture,

836
00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:22.273
look at this picture,

837
00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:22.661
I want it.

838
00:22:22.661 --> 00:22:25.480
I talked to him on Friday or Saturday,

839
00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:26.493
you know?

840
00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:27.500
Yeah.

841
00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:28.510
Well that's nice.

842
00:22:28.511 --> 00:22:30.070
First Time in like 10 years.

843
00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:30.370
Yeah.

844
00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:31.780
Working with people that are on drugs.

845
00:22:31.781 --> 00:22:32.614
It's very strange,

846
00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:33.011
you know,

847
00:22:33.011 --> 00:22:34.350
hanging with people that I am.

848
00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:39.390
I had a friend who was that a serious fucking crack coke and heroin problem and

849
00:22:40.181 --> 00:22:45.130
eventually died is a good buddy of mine and a New York and he,

850
00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:45.551
you know,

851
00:22:45.551 --> 00:22:46.840
he would fucking vanish.

852
00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:48.700
He would go on benders and you know,

853
00:22:48.701 --> 00:22:51.970
he would always want to get dropped off or like near a crack house like she was.

854
00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:52.931
It was really crazy.

855
00:22:52.931 --> 00:22:54.700
And then he would clean up for awhile and it'd be great.

856
00:22:54.701 --> 00:22:56.200
And then he'd go right back at it.

857
00:22:56.201 --> 00:23:00.290
And did you ever work the Kansas City club Stanford and was fuck yeah,

858
00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:01.840
those beetle juice,

859
00:23:01.841 --> 00:23:02.021
you know,

860
00:23:02.021 --> 00:23:03.040
one of them's one of them.

861
00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:03.500
Dot.

862
00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:03.730
Oh,

863
00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:04.061
you know,

864
00:23:04.061 --> 00:23:06.520
things happen over in council up.

865
00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:07.611
Craig Glacier.

866
00:23:07.611 --> 00:23:08.020
Uh,

867
00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:12.190
I gotta I got a Mazda Rati things happened in the bag and I'm begging this black

868
00:23:12.191 --> 00:23:15.670
chick and she's only a county clinic.

869
00:23:15.671 --> 00:23:16.600
She's pretty hot.

870
00:23:16.601 --> 00:23:17.140
Uh,

871
00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:17.711
Joe Rogan,

872
00:23:17.711 --> 00:23:18.461
we'll come back here.

873
00:23:18.461 --> 00:23:19.660
I don't know why it's weird.

874
00:23:19.661 --> 00:23:22.600
I call them every week and he just doesn't return my calls.

875
00:23:22.601 --> 00:23:24.170
And I would like to come back to Kansas City,

876
00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:26.650
but I don't want to deal with those.

877
00:23:26.651 --> 00:23:28.630
Dudes are great to have your rear view mirror.

878
00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:32.820
They need to be known though by the world.

879
00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:33.130
Well,

880
00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:34.660
their characters and I appreciate them.

881
00:23:34.661 --> 00:23:35.231
I really do.

882
00:23:35.231 --> 00:23:35.801
I appreciate it.

883
00:23:35.801 --> 00:23:36.850
All comedy club owners,

884
00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:37.630
I mean,

885
00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:38.110
he didn't,

886
00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:39.550
I had a good time working for that guy.

887
00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:41.260
He didn't try to fuck me.

888
00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:41.510
No,

889
00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:41.661
no,

890
00:23:41.661 --> 00:23:41.820
no.

891
00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:43.480
We got a long ways you pays,

892
00:23:43.481 --> 00:23:44.410
you mean?

893
00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:44.950
Yeah,

894
00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:45.950
I meant financially.

895
00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:47.480
<v 6>I meant financially.</v>

896
00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:48.290
I mean,

897
00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:49.490
I've had the issues before.

898
00:23:49.491 --> 00:23:51.980
I mean these guys to this day that I'll never forget,

899
00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:52.461
you know,

900
00:23:52.461 --> 00:23:55.430
and he's a couple of guys I still work for that tried to fuck me and they didn't

901
00:23:55.431 --> 00:23:56.330
get away with fucking me,

902
00:23:56.331 --> 00:23:58.100
but I know the fact that they tried to and it's like,

903
00:23:58.101 --> 00:23:58.970
come on man,

904
00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:03.920
you know lies about how many tickets are sold and you find out or you know,

905
00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:04.970
there's clubs that,

906
00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:05.891
there was a,

907
00:24:05.891 --> 00:24:10.891
a famous story of a guy on stage at a club and he makes everybody in the club,

908
00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:12.920
uh,

909
00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:14.210
count off a number.

910
00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:14.810
And I'm like,

911
00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:15.441
well first of all,

912
00:24:15.441 --> 00:24:19.310
what a Douche bag he is to use this stage.

913
00:24:19.311 --> 00:24:20.500
Time to find it.

914
00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:22.070
I'm getting fucked financially,

915
00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:23.263
but the fucking,

916
00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:26.840
it was 200 seats under what he thought it was.

917
00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:28.580
Like he looked out and he's like,

918
00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:30.440
this is not 300 fucking seats,

919
00:24:30.441 --> 00:24:31.274
man.

920
00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:32.090
And the guy's like,

921
00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:33.910
it's 300 seats and you won't even want to tell me.

922
00:24:33.911 --> 00:24:35.560
And we got a door deal is your money?

923
00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:36.590
And he's wrong.

924
00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:37.310
Oh,

925
00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:37.731
oh yeah.

926
00:24:37.731 --> 00:24:37.881
The,

927
00:24:37.881 --> 00:24:41.240
the comedian was right by the comedian was right.

928
00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:43.450
The club tried to fuck them by 200

929
00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:44.343
<v 3>seats.</v>

930
00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:46.961
I heard,

931
00:24:46.961 --> 00:24:49.690
I heard a comic at one of the clubs,

932
00:24:49.691 --> 00:24:54.580
one of the clubs I was working that a comic came through and that he would take

933
00:24:54.581 --> 00:24:55.420
so many comps.

934
00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:56.540
They would sell it out and he had it.

935
00:24:56.610 --> 00:25:01.090
He was on a guarantee and then they would take like 40 comps or whatever and

936
00:25:01.091 --> 00:25:05.280
then his manager would be outside scalping the comp.

937
00:25:05.281 --> 00:25:05.690
So,

938
00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:06.820
oh my God.

939
00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:09.090
<v 6>No,</v>

940
00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:10.410
but I love that story.

941
00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:11.400
That's hilarious.

942
00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:12.233
That sounds normal.

943
00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:14.310
That sounds like a guy trying to hustle.

944
00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:14.941
Hey,

945
00:25:14.941 --> 00:25:15.840
you gotta make money.

946
00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:16.763
What are you going to do?

947
00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:17.310
You know,

948
00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:19.140
maybe he's managing a guy that's on TV.

949
00:25:19.141 --> 00:25:20.370
It just needs some,

950
00:25:20.371 --> 00:25:20.720
no,

951
00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:23.460
this guy was a big name and he names you got bills,

952
00:25:23.461 --> 00:25:23.891
you know,

953
00:25:23.891 --> 00:25:25.110
it's got a little overhead.

954
00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:27.210
He wants to make an extra.

955
00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:27.631
I mean,

956
00:25:27.631 --> 00:25:28.051
what are they?

957
00:25:28.051 --> 00:25:29.230
Let's say 40 bucks a year.

958
00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:31.380
I know I got bills to pay.

959
00:25:31.381 --> 00:25:32.730
I've got bills to pay.

960
00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:33.171
<v 3>Do you ever,</v>

961
00:25:33.171 --> 00:25:34.004
do you guys ever count?

962
00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:37.400
I've done that before where I will sit in the back and just try to count like I

963
00:25:37.401 --> 00:25:38.450
have a rough number.

964
00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:39.420
Yeah,

965
00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:40.520
I absolutely,

966
00:25:40.521 --> 00:25:41.354
I do

967
00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:44.850
<v 6>do that when you should know how many seats of club has legitimately if you got</v>

968
00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:45.743
a deal,

969
00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:47.370
but if you don't have a deal it doesn't matter.

970
00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:47.581
You know,

971
00:25:47.581 --> 00:25:48.560
if you get paid x amount.

972
00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:52.330
<v 3>I've had some shitty shit just happened to me lately where um,</v>

973
00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:53.411
you know,

974
00:25:53.411 --> 00:25:53.840
where,

975
00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:54.673
uh,

976
00:25:54.690 --> 00:25:55.523
I,

977
00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:58.970
<v 6>well you know what I think about thinking about whether or not you want to say</v>

978
00:25:58.971 --> 00:25:59.160
it right.

979
00:25:59.160 --> 00:25:59.993
Yeah,

980
00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:00.830
I know what you're saying.

981
00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:01.610
There's a,

982
00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:01.971
you know,

983
00:26:01.971 --> 00:26:03.080
and like I said,

984
00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:06.410
I appreciate comedy club owners cause it's a fucking business that I don't want

985
00:26:06.411 --> 00:26:06.801
to be in.

986
00:26:06.801 --> 00:26:07.061
No,

987
00:26:07.061 --> 00:26:07.290
it's,

988
00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:09.470
I don't want to deal with a bunch of guys like us.

989
00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:12.440
Could you imagine dealing with a bunch of us every week?

990
00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:14.240
That's who you're making your living off of this.

991
00:26:14.241 --> 00:26:14.841
That'd be crazy.

992
00:26:14.841 --> 00:26:18.170
You got to count on Joey d has to show up for a weekend or you don't pay your

993
00:26:18.171 --> 00:26:19.004
fucking bills.

994
00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:19.700
You know,

995
00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:22.250
you got to count on this guy to show up and not be crazy.

996
00:26:22.251 --> 00:26:26.030
That guy show up and not do crack after the first show and then fuck off.

997
00:26:26.031 --> 00:26:27.440
They'll the last two shows

998
00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:28.080
<v 3>love.</v>

999
00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:28.950
I just worked at,

1000
00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:29.550
uh,

1001
00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:30.480
the club owner.

1002
00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:31.410
Great Guy.

1003
00:26:31.410 --> 00:26:31.771
And it's a,

1004
00:26:31.771 --> 00:26:32.604
it's a funny,

1005
00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:34.590
have you ever heard of this club Captain Bryan's?

1006
00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:35.070
No.

1007
00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:35.903
That kept him rinds?

1008
00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:36.450
No.

1009
00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:41.070
It's a seafood restaurant in Florida and the guy brings in the big,

1010
00:26:41.071 --> 00:26:42.480
big names and you know,

1011
00:26:42.481 --> 00:26:44.490
drew Carey did it recently and,

1012
00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:45.331
and he,

1013
00:26:45.331 --> 00:26:46.770
this guy knows how to market.

1014
00:26:46.771 --> 00:26:48.150
He knows how to sell tickets.

1015
00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:51.750
He's in this little island in Florida called Marco Island and he packs the

1016
00:26:51.751 --> 00:26:56.230
seafood place and he sells everyone at dinner and he's moving up,

1017
00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:56.920
uh,

1018
00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:01.920
up near Naples to a 650 seat location that possibly if they moved the chairs

1019
00:27:02.971 --> 00:27:03.151
right,

1020
00:27:03.151 --> 00:27:04.310
they can put 1100.

1021
00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:05.243
Oh my God,

1022
00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:05.460
he's,

1023
00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:06.480
and he's awesome.

1024
00:27:06.481 --> 00:27:08.160
And he stands by the comics.

1025
00:27:08.161 --> 00:27:10.920
I love this because there was a comic who got in trouble recently,

1026
00:27:10.921 --> 00:27:15.040
like got in trouble down there and the cops were after him and he stood by him.

1027
00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:16.013
And uh,

1028
00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:20.850
the other night I gotten a bit of an altercation at his club and I thought he

1029
00:27:20.851 --> 00:27:23.820
wasn't there and I thought I called them the next day to kind of say,

1030
00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:24.700
look,

1031
00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:25.680
wasn't my fault.

1032
00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:27.150
Just want to let you know.

1033
00:27:27.450 --> 00:27:28.021
And they're all like,

1034
00:27:28.021 --> 00:27:28.621
don't worry about it.

1035
00:27:28.621 --> 00:27:29.670
He's got your back.

1036
00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:30.533
Like he's,

1037
00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:32.400
he's stands behind his comics.

1038
00:27:32.401 --> 00:27:32.731
And I thought,

1039
00:27:32.731 --> 00:27:32.850
Oh,

1040
00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:33.150
you know,

1041
00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:33.983
I'm getting,

1042
00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:34.591
they're going to tell me,

1043
00:27:34.591 --> 00:27:35.970
never fucking come back here.

1044
00:27:35.971 --> 00:27:36.211
Blah,

1045
00:27:36.211 --> 00:27:36.361
blah,

1046
00:27:36.361 --> 00:27:37.194
blah.

1047
00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:38.100
And uh,

1048
00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:38.581
and he's,

1049
00:27:38.581 --> 00:27:39.091
he's,

1050
00:27:39.091 --> 00:27:40.470
he's one of those good guys.

1051
00:27:40.471 --> 00:27:41.370
There's a lot of real,

1052
00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:42.720
there's a lot of scumbags.

1053
00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:43.800
There's a lot of piece of shit

1054
00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:44.760
<v 6>business.</v>

1055
00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:46.780
The club business is tough.

1056
00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:47.673
First of all,

1057
00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:49.150
who's your,

1058
00:27:49.150 --> 00:27:51.760
the people that you're dealing with for the most part are drunk.

1059
00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:52.400
You,

1060
00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:54.010
you're basically a drug dealer.

1061
00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:54.760
That's what you are.

1062
00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:55.420
Not only that,

1063
00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:59.200
they do their drugs in your establishment and by the way you could be sued if

1064
00:27:59.201 --> 00:28:02.470
you give them too many drugs and they get in their car and go smashing into

1065
00:28:02.471 --> 00:28:03.160
somebody and kill them.

1066
00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:03.400
Yeah.

1067
00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:07.480
So you've got a lot of stress and then you got these drunk people that want to

1068
00:28:07.481 --> 00:28:08.201
yell things out.

1069
00:28:08.201 --> 00:28:11.800
I want to show is going on and then you have to get them kicked out and then you

1070
00:28:11.801 --> 00:28:14.890
find out your bartenders been stealing from you and then you found out,

1071
00:28:14.891 --> 00:28:15.400
you know,

1072
00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:20.400
this is going on and that's going the wars in the world and your place and we're

1073
00:28:21.010 --> 00:28:21.701
not the worst.

1074
00:28:21.701 --> 00:28:22.690
I think we're second.

1075
00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:24.170
I think bands,

1076
00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:25.250
yeah,

1077
00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:26.380
I think bands would be worse,

1078
00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:28.740
<v 3>but I think Dan's get a little more of a,</v>

1079
00:28:28.741 --> 00:28:29.820
a little more leeway than,

1080
00:28:29.821 --> 00:28:30.520
yeah,

1081
00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:31.700
<v 6>I don't know about that man.</v>

1082
00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:33.600
They're expected to fuck up there.

1083
00:28:33.601 --> 00:28:35.600
They're expected to be wild and crazy.

1084
00:28:35.601 --> 00:28:40.470
But I know a band which were main stone temple pilots and they were hired for a

1085
00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:41.900
birthday party of a friend of mine,

1086
00:28:41.901 --> 00:28:42.560
Dan White.

1087
00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:46.550
And I was there while that's Scott Guy,

1088
00:28:46.551 --> 00:28:50.450
the lead guy was throwing a fucking temper tantrum in the back about the show

1089
00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:52.190
like has to start and you know,

1090
00:28:52.191 --> 00:28:55.690
an x amount of minutes or they're fucking leaving and fuck this and fuck us any

1091
00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:56.540
of the heroin addict.

1092
00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:56.910
Yeah,

1093
00:28:56.910 --> 00:28:57.260
yeah.

1094
00:28:57.260 --> 00:29:00.020
They were paying him a shit load of money to be there.

1095
00:29:00.021 --> 00:29:03.380
And it was really weird because the show starts and they go,

1096
00:29:03.381 --> 00:29:06.050
I mean this is a private party and fucking stone temple party,

1097
00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:07.040
Stone Temple pilots.

1098
00:29:07.041 --> 00:29:08.030
Is that a private party?

1099
00:29:08.031 --> 00:29:08.360
Yeah.

1100
00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:08.571
Okay.

1101
00:29:08.571 --> 00:29:11.960
So I don't know what insane amount of money they had to pay them to do that,

1102
00:29:11.961 --> 00:29:14.000
but I assume it was big money.

1103
00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:14.631
So,

1104
00:29:14.631 --> 00:29:15.080
um,

1105
00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:15.620
anyway,

1106
00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:16.040
um,

1107
00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:20.240
they come out and are fucking nailing it,

1108
00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:22.550
but no one's paying attention.

1109
00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:27.820
It's the weirdest thing ever because you've got stone temple pilots and they

1110
00:29:28.051 --> 00:29:30.620
were on stage and they're fucking killing it.

1111
00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:32.840
That guy is a bad motherfucker.

1112
00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:34.070
And when I watched it,

1113
00:29:34.071 --> 00:29:34.670
I was like,

1114
00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:39.350
I was like inspired to perform better on stage after watching him do a live

1115
00:29:39.351 --> 00:29:39.740
show.

1116
00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:42.580
But when I tell you there's 10 people on the dance floor,

1117
00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:43.720
I'm being kind.

1118
00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:48.670
There's 10 people in the dance world and the stone temple mother fucking pilots

1119
00:29:48.671 --> 00:29:49.504
is onstage.

1120
00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:52.690
They didn't know what to do yet because everybody had been sitting down before.

1121
00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:53.080
Uh,

1122
00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:54.610
we brought stone temple pilots up.

1123
00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:56.290
It was like a happy birthday,

1124
00:29:56.291 --> 00:29:57.011
Dana thing.

1125
00:29:57.011 --> 00:29:59.130
A bunch of people gave speeches and I,

1126
00:29:59.131 --> 00:30:01.870
I gave a speech and then I brought up stone temple pilots.

1127
00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:05.350
So then someone says one of the executives like,

1128
00:30:05.351 --> 00:30:06.011
come on everybody,

1129
00:30:06.011 --> 00:30:06.371
get up,

1130
00:30:06.371 --> 00:30:06.671
get up,

1131
00:30:06.671 --> 00:30:07.210
get up.

1132
00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:10.210
Like he felt bad that no one was on the dance floor,

1133
00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:10.901
but it was,

1134
00:30:10.901 --> 00:30:12.100
it was a strange moment.

1135
00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:12.671
Like first of all,

1136
00:30:12.671 --> 00:30:15.010
people did not expect that stone temple pilots is going to be there.

1137
00:30:15.011 --> 00:30:15.844
It was a surprise.

1138
00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:17.980
So it kind of trip Dana a trip to everybody.

1139
00:30:17.981 --> 00:30:18.940
I feel like what?

1140
00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:20.111
And then boom,

1141
00:30:20.111 --> 00:30:23.710
these guys go up on stage and people didn't know exactly what to do.

1142
00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:25.950
<v 3>Well I've,</v>

1143
00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:26.370
I've,

1144
00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:27.570
I've talked to guys in bands and,

1145
00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:28.231
and for them,

1146
00:30:28.231 --> 00:30:28.531
you know,

1147
00:30:28.531 --> 00:30:30.900
for us corporates are fucking hell.

1148
00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:31.830
She's feeling,

1149
00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:32.663
you feel like a whore.

1150
00:30:32.670 --> 00:30:33.060
Well,

1151
00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:34.200
they do too in bands.

1152
00:30:34.201 --> 00:30:36.310
And it's tough because when,

1153
00:30:36.311 --> 00:30:38.580
when they play a concert there fans come to see them.

1154
00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:40.020
All of a sudden in that crowd,

1155
00:30:40.021 --> 00:30:43.130
there might've been maybe a 10th of the people where their fan,

1156
00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:43.331
<v 6>well,</v>

1157
00:30:43.331 --> 00:30:44.200
there were so bad ass,

1158
00:30:44.201 --> 00:30:44.801
it didn't matter.

1159
00:30:44.801 --> 00:30:46.570
But what did matters at the end,

1160
00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:49.900
he had to sing happy birthday to Dana,

1161
00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:53.440
had a singing happy birthday,

1162
00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:57.010
you're singing happy birthday and now you're not just saying it,

1163
00:30:57.011 --> 00:31:01.510
you're saying it to a man and you have sang happy birthday to a man and that's

1164
00:31:01.511 --> 00:31:02.020
part of

1165
00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:05.350
<v 3>like a slow song or is it like it like a rock out song on his Dick in his hand.</v>

1166
00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:08.350
So mean you can't sing that fast when you're jerking off.

1167
00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:09.670
He just got kicked out by the way.

1168
00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:11.230
They kicked [inaudible] pilots kicked him.

1169
00:31:11.231 --> 00:31:12.220
I met him in,

1170
00:31:12.221 --> 00:31:12.640
uh,

1171
00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:12.881
you know,

1172
00:31:12.881 --> 00:31:14.590
the bar right next to the left factory.

1173
00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:15.700
Uh,

1174
00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:16.720
I forget what it used to be called,

1175
00:31:16.721 --> 00:31:17.554
hide or something.

1176
00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:18.850
It's in there one night.

1177
00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:23.200
And this dude walks up to me and ask me for drugs and I look at them,

1178
00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:25.090
I look at them and I go,

1179
00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:26.651
holy fuck,

1180
00:31:26.651 --> 00:31:27.420
it's you.

1181
00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:27.881
And I'm like,

1182
00:31:27.881 --> 00:31:29.410
how cliche is this?

1183
00:31:29.650 --> 00:31:30.483
Like you just,

1184
00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:33.310
but he and I was all excited and I'm like,

1185
00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:34.990
why don't you just fucking ask me for drugs?

1186
00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:36.790
And everyone in there was like,

1187
00:31:36.791 --> 00:31:36.941
yeah,

1188
00:31:36.941 --> 00:31:37.774
he asked us to,

1189
00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:39.220
he asked everyone here,

1190
00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:39.881
like,

1191
00:31:39.881 --> 00:31:41.440
he just walked around going,

1192
00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:42.131
you got drugs,

1193
00:31:42.131 --> 00:31:42.740
you've got drugs.

1194
00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:43.573
She got drugs.

1195
00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:46.480
I hung out with that dude from Friday last night.

1196
00:31:46.481 --> 00:31:49.990
The big guy looks like ving Rhames by out one of his eyes is like silver and

1197
00:31:49.991 --> 00:31:50.824
stuff like that.

1198
00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:51.911
You know what I'm talking about?

1199
00:31:51.911 --> 00:31:52.750
That big,

1200
00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:53.830
big black dude.

1201
00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:54.160
What's this?

1202
00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:54.993
Oh,

1203
00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:56.290
Debo.

1204
00:31:56.290 --> 00:31:56.581
Oh yeah,

1205
00:31:56.581 --> 00:31:56.881
yeah,

1206
00:31:56.881 --> 00:31:57.101
yeah.

1207
00:31:57.101 --> 00:31:57.860
I know you're talking about.

1208
00:31:57.860 --> 00:31:58.180
Yeah,

1209
00:31:58.180 --> 00:31:58.541
he,

1210
00:31:58.541 --> 00:31:58.720
uh,

1211
00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:00.070
he was there with his daughter,

1212
00:32:00.071 --> 00:32:01.000
like six year old,

1213
00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:04.780
seven year old daughter and his wife and he just came in to hang out for a bit

1214
00:32:05.410 --> 00:32:06.430
to the comedy store.

1215
00:32:06.550 --> 00:32:06.731
Oh,

1216
00:32:06.731 --> 00:32:07.480
that's hilarious.

1217
00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:09.790
1:00 AM if you want to meet famous people,

1218
00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:11.620
go to the comedy clubs in La.

1219
00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:12.310
Yeah,

1220
00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:12.970
they go,

1221
00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:14.020
there's a lot of that.

1222
00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:14.321
Bam.

1223
00:32:14.321 --> 00:32:16.320
Was there also wasted Dan Scott,

1224
00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:16.901
Waylon guy.

1225
00:32:16.901 --> 00:32:17.031
What,

1226
00:32:17.031 --> 00:32:19.000
what drugs in specific?

1227
00:32:19.090 --> 00:32:20.020
I don't want to,

1228
00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:20.831
I don't want to say,

1229
00:32:20.831 --> 00:32:21.760
but I think he has for,

1230
00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:22.960
I'm not positive,

1231
00:32:22.961 --> 00:32:24.010
but I think he has for coke.

1232
00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:26.280
I think he has what code somebody would ask for.

1233
00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:30.100
Cause you're not gonna ask for heroin is heroin on them who asked for?

1234
00:32:30.130 --> 00:32:32.620
We'd ask you for weed all the time.

1235
00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:33.470
Yeah.

1236
00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:34.700
But a lot of people ask me for a week.

1237
00:32:34.770 --> 00:32:36.790
But you're hanging around with brokers at the comedy store?

1238
00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:36.941
No,

1239
00:32:36.941 --> 00:32:38.770
it's mostly tourists from Canada and stuff.

1240
00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:39.350
Oh,

1241
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:39.830
even worse.

1242
00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:43.850
And I've been accused actually this week twice I was accused of being on coke

1243
00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:45.253
twice.

1244
00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:46.880
I hung out after my shell.

1245
00:32:46.881 --> 00:32:47.260
I met,

1246
00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:48.050
uh,

1247
00:32:48.050 --> 00:32:51.920
these doctors who went to the same university I went to and we started talking

1248
00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:53.023
and uh,

1249
00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:56.570
they came back the next night and they were talking to me and something came up

1250
00:32:56.571 --> 00:32:57.404
about drugs and they were like,

1251
00:32:57.410 --> 00:32:57.890
oh you don't,

1252
00:32:57.890 --> 00:32:59.030
you really don't do cocaine.

1253
00:32:59.031 --> 00:32:59.301
I said,

1254
00:32:59.301 --> 00:33:00.020
no.

1255
00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:00.560
And they go,

1256
00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:00.771
oh,

1257
00:33:00.771 --> 00:33:02.240
we were sure you were on coke.

1258
00:33:02.241 --> 00:33:05.120
Your pupils are really dilated and uh,

1259
00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:07.340
these two doctors thought it was uncovered.

1260
00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:11.470
So then the next night I got in some gotten this like altercation with this dude

1261
00:33:11.471 --> 00:33:11.811
and he's like,

1262
00:33:11.811 --> 00:33:12.471
you're on coke,

1263
00:33:12.471 --> 00:33:13.220
you're on coke.

1264
00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:14.053
And I'm like,

1265
00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:14.571
no,

1266
00:33:14.571 --> 00:33:15.560
not like,

1267
00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:15.921
he's like,

1268
00:33:15.921 --> 00:33:16.701
I'm getting the cops.

1269
00:33:16.701 --> 00:33:17.060
And I'm like,

1270
00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:17.430
yeah,

1271
00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:17.840
I'm not,

1272
00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:18.710
that's hilarious.

1273
00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:19.011
Yeah.

1274
00:33:19.011 --> 00:33:19.640
And I'm like,

1275
00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:19.821
why?

1276
00:33:19.821 --> 00:33:20.654
Why does everyone think I'm going?

1277
00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:21.260
And I said,

1278
00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:22.610
you're a little like that's what he said.

1279
00:33:22.611 --> 00:33:23.280
My friends.

1280
00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:23.450
Yeah.

1281
00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:23.811
They were like,

1282
00:33:23.811 --> 00:33:24.081
you're,

1283
00:33:24.081 --> 00:33:24.351
you're,

1284
00:33:24.351 --> 00:33:25.184
you look like you're okay.

1285
00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:26.280
<v 7>Oh you don't,</v>

1286
00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:27.560
there's a big difference.

1287
00:33:27.561 --> 00:33:29.210
People would just like to say shit like that.

1288
00:33:29.211 --> 00:33:30.200
If you have too much energy,

1289
00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:32.750
I want to calm you down and slow you down.

1290
00:33:32.751 --> 00:33:34.910
It's sort of a subliminal way to get you to stop being.

1291
00:33:34.911 --> 00:33:36.680
So if they're getting,

1292
00:33:36.681 --> 00:33:39.110
if they're getting elevated and you're getting elevated,

1293
00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:40.760
if they say you're on coke,

1294
00:33:40.850 --> 00:33:43.370
you automatically tried to like suppress it.

1295
00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:46.640
<v 3>Well it's the checkers move probably what was happening.</v>

1296
00:33:46.641 --> 00:33:49.190
Cause this guy and I were kind of getting in a fight and he was like,

1297
00:33:49.191 --> 00:33:50.020
I'm calling the cops.

1298
00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:53.050
I'm sure you fight so much right now.

1299
00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:53.893
He's never fight.

1300
00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:56.090
I never ever get really close.

1301
00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:56.511
But no,

1302
00:33:56.511 --> 00:33:58.190
this one almost happened Saturday night.

1303
00:33:58.220 --> 00:33:59.010
About what?

1304
00:33:59.010 --> 00:33:59.843
Um,

1305
00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:00.891
I walked,

1306
00:34:00.891 --> 00:34:02.770
I was leaving the comedy club and um,

1307
00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:03.740
I'm going to,

1308
00:34:03.741 --> 00:34:04.820
I rented a scooter,

1309
00:34:04.821 --> 00:34:09.821
I was on this little island and rented a scooter and I thought it was so much

1310
00:34:11.061 --> 00:34:11.894
fucking fun.

1311
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:12.641
I could,

1312
00:34:12.641 --> 00:34:13.311
not bad,

1313
00:34:13.311 --> 00:34:15.890
but I just don't trust those car things are all around you.

1314
00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:16.380
Yeah.

1315
00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:17.300
But this island,

1316
00:34:17.301 --> 00:34:17.730
nobody,

1317
00:34:17.730 --> 00:34:19.040
there are people in golf carts.

1318
00:34:19.390 --> 00:34:20.330
It's isolated.

1319
00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:25.040
So I see the staff in this bar across the parking lot,

1320
00:34:25.041 --> 00:34:25.581
this Irish pub.

1321
00:34:25.581 --> 00:34:26.330
And I thought,

1322
00:34:26.330 --> 00:34:27.740
I'll go in and they're all really nice.

1323
00:34:27.741 --> 00:34:28.150
They work well.

1324
00:34:28.150 --> 00:34:30.230
I'll go buy them around and say good night.

1325
00:34:30.410 --> 00:34:34.610
So I go in to buy them around the drinks and the bartender kind of loses it.

1326
00:34:34.670 --> 00:34:35.810
This chick that,

1327
00:34:35.811 --> 00:34:36.350
uh,

1328
00:34:36.350 --> 00:34:37.730
it's one 30 and she's like,

1329
00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:37.971
ah,

1330
00:34:37.971 --> 00:34:38.340
you know,

1331
00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:40.160
it's the last call or whatever.

1332
00:34:40.161 --> 00:34:40.491
And I said,

1333
00:34:40.491 --> 00:34:41.570
I just want to get them a drink.

1334
00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:42.740
And she,

1335
00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:43.400
they said,

1336
00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:44.930
I thought you stay open until two.

1337
00:34:44.931 --> 00:34:46.070
It's always up until two.

1338
00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:50.810
She started yelling at them and she was being really country to every single

1339
00:34:50.811 --> 00:34:51.650
person.

1340
00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:54.740
And I like to think I'm good with people.

1341
00:34:54.890 --> 00:34:59.180
So I went around the bar and culture to the side to be nice to her and say,

1342
00:34:59.181 --> 00:34:59.481
Hey,

1343
00:34:59.481 --> 00:35:00.980
I know you might be having a bad night,

1344
00:35:00.981 --> 00:35:01.701
that kind of thing.

1345
00:35:01.701 --> 00:35:02.690
I'm sorry Blah Blah Blah.

1346
00:35:02.691 --> 00:35:03.980
I'm sorry if I ordered around,

1347
00:35:03.981 --> 00:35:08.981
it's late because really I wanted more lives in my drink that she gave me and I

1348
00:35:09.621 --> 00:35:10.070
go out,

1349
00:35:10.070 --> 00:35:11.540
is there any way I can get some more lines?

1350
00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:12.201
And she was like,

1351
00:35:12.201 --> 00:35:13.034
really?

1352
00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:15.470
You want more fucking limes and your drink?

1353
00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:16.470
And I was like,

1354
00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:16.670
yeah.

1355
00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:20.660
And then it just started to get more and more heated where she just was like,

1356
00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:22.700
be rating me like just,

1357
00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:23.773
and it wasn't,

1358
00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:27.410
it wasn't like this Daniel Tosh like ha ha ha,

1359
00:35:27.411 --> 00:35:28.670
I'm joking kind of thing.

1360
00:35:28.671 --> 00:35:29.180
It was,

1361
00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:33.110
she was just being a cunt to me and I went like this at the end she goes,

1362
00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:34.970
so do you want your limes now?

1363
00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:36.253
And I go,

1364
00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:36.890
no,

1365
00:35:36.890 --> 00:35:37.630
I,

1366
00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:38.650
I don't want the lines.

1367
00:35:38.830 --> 00:35:39.880
I don't want anything from you.

1368
00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:40.121
I go,

1369
00:35:40.121 --> 00:35:41.590
cause you're a horrible person.

1370
00:35:42.130 --> 00:35:43.450
I go and I don't say that to anyone.

1371
00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:43.840
I go,

1372
00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:45.670
you're a horrible person.

1373
00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:47.080
And I walked over to the other,

1374
00:35:47.081 --> 00:35:47.914
the staff and I go,

1375
00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:49.550
she's a worst person I've ever met.

1376
00:35:49.551 --> 00:35:49.610
Yeah.

1377
00:35:49.610 --> 00:35:50.061
<v 5>My life.</v>

1378
00:35:50.061 --> 00:35:50.480
I go,

1379
00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:50.631
well,

1380
00:35:50.631 --> 00:35:51.530
you got off light.

1381
00:35:51.590 --> 00:35:52.940
If does the worst person you ever met?

1382
00:35:53.230 --> 00:35:53.440
Well,

1383
00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:56.180
I was exaggerating the spell horrible with a w,

1384
00:35:56.210 --> 00:35:57.090
but I can't.

1385
00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:58.311
I said,

1386
00:35:58.311 --> 00:35:59.144
this person,

1387
00:35:59.690 --> 00:36:00.111
I said,

1388
00:36:00.111 --> 00:36:02.120
I don't know what happened to her in her life,

1389
00:36:02.121 --> 00:36:05.030
who physically or mentally abused her or whatever.

1390
00:36:05.031 --> 00:36:05.680
I said,

1391
00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:05.911
I go,

1392
00:36:05.911 --> 00:36:09.650
I've had murderers on my podcast that are nicer people than her.

1393
00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:10.191
I go,

1394
00:36:10.191 --> 00:36:10.640
I've had,

1395
00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:13.280
I've had a couple people in my life that have murdered people.

1396
00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:14.440
You shouldn't say that problem.

1397
00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:15.260
And I said,

1398
00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:15.411
no,

1399
00:36:15.411 --> 00:36:15.600
no,

1400
00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:15.820
they're,

1401
00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:18.100
they've gone to jail and served time and everything's okay.

1402
00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:18.973
But I go,

1403
00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:20.150
<v 3>I,</v>

1404
00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:20.650
she's still,

1405
00:36:20.650 --> 00:36:23.950
and I just kept talking to them but loudly that she could hear it.

1406
00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:28.500
So she went in the back and started crying and uh,

1407
00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:29.710
like I broke her.

1408
00:36:29.711 --> 00:36:30.041
She,

1409
00:36:30.041 --> 00:36:30.520
she,

1410
00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:31.353
that was it.

1411
00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:31.931
And,

1412
00:36:31.931 --> 00:36:32.764
uh,

1413
00:36:32.830 --> 00:36:36.010
so I'm out in the parking lot and all of a sudden two guys that work in the back

1414
00:36:36.011 --> 00:36:40.540
of the kitchen come running out at me and they come like running at me.

1415
00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:42.190
And I know there were cops in the parking lot.

1416
00:36:42.191 --> 00:36:44.620
I go where the cops and I'm just like backing up,

1417
00:36:44.621 --> 00:36:45.670
like looking for the cops.

1418
00:36:45.671 --> 00:36:46.001
Cause I'm like,

1419
00:36:46.001 --> 00:36:47.320
I'm not going to fight these guys.

1420
00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:48.461
And then,

1421
00:36:48.461 --> 00:36:48.940
uh,

1422
00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:49.810
no cops.

1423
00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:50.471
So I'm like,

1424
00:36:50.471 --> 00:36:50.981
Oh fuck,

1425
00:36:50.981 --> 00:36:51.820
this is happening.

1426
00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:52.691
And I'm like,

1427
00:36:52.691 --> 00:36:53.050
they're going to,

1428
00:36:53.050 --> 00:36:54.010
they're going to jump me,

1429
00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:54.281
you know,

1430
00:36:54.281 --> 00:36:56.200
this is like some town in Florida.

1431
00:36:56.201 --> 00:36:56.501
And I'm like,

1432
00:36:56.501 --> 00:36:57.610
I don't know what to do.

1433
00:36:57.850 --> 00:36:58.930
So I,

1434
00:36:58.931 --> 00:36:59.200
uh,

1435
00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:00.070
do what I do best.

1436
00:37:00.071 --> 00:37:00.904
I lied.

1437
00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:02.553
What'd you do?

1438
00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:03.520
You don't want to fuck with me.

1439
00:37:03.521 --> 00:37:03.760
God,

1440
00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:04.610
I look at the one guy who,

1441
00:37:04.611 --> 00:37:05.230
a year old,

1442
00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:06.700
I'll drop you in one punch.

1443
00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:08.050
And I looked the other guy go,

1444
00:37:08.170 --> 00:37:09.040
I fight MMA,

1445
00:37:09.041 --> 00:37:09.400
dude,

1446
00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:10.720
I'm gonna choke you out.

1447
00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:11.980
I'm going to kick your teeth in.

1448
00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:12.371
I go,

1449
00:37:12.371 --> 00:37:13.210
when you go out,

1450
00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:15.610
I'm kicking your fucking teeth in and you're going to,

1451
00:37:15.611 --> 00:37:17.140
you're going to wake up with no teeth.

1452
00:37:17.290 --> 00:37:20.760
And I'm going to right away on my scooter and I know word,

1453
00:37:20.850 --> 00:37:21.790
I didn't mention it as a skirt.

1454
00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:23.530
It diffused.

1455
00:37:23.531 --> 00:37:25.930
It's so quickly cause the guy realized that like,

1456
00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:28.720
and he was like a big fat dude and the truth is one on one.

1457
00:37:28.721 --> 00:37:29.240
I could probably,

1458
00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:30.150
<v 5>here's what happened,</v>

1459
00:37:30.151 --> 00:37:32.500
the old dude and the fat dude want to fuck the con.

1460
00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:33.010
Yeah,

1461
00:37:33.010 --> 00:37:33.660
exactly.

1462
00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:36.230
The exact came out to try to get some Brownie points.

1463
00:37:36.410 --> 00:37:39.980
They tried to do some white knight action but then the dude goes to pull out of

1464
00:37:39.981 --> 00:37:41.060
his pocket and I'm like,

1465
00:37:41.090 --> 00:37:41.901
oh fuck,

1466
00:37:41.901 --> 00:37:42.621
he's got a gun.

1467
00:37:42.621 --> 00:37:42.981
And I'm like,

1468
00:37:42.981 --> 00:37:44.030
I should have just run.

1469
00:37:44.090 --> 00:37:47.300
Should I just run when they came out and he pulls out his cell phone,

1470
00:37:47.301 --> 00:37:47.601
he goes,

1471
00:37:47.601 --> 00:37:49.010
I'm calling the cops and I'm like,

1472
00:37:49.011 --> 00:37:49.844
good,

1473
00:37:49.850 --> 00:37:50.451
you guys just,

1474
00:37:50.451 --> 00:37:51.500
we're going to jump me.

1475
00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:52.670
I go get the cops.

1476
00:37:52.671 --> 00:37:53.001
And he goes,

1477
00:37:53.001 --> 00:37:53.661
you're on coke,

1478
00:37:53.661 --> 00:37:54.410
you're on coke.

1479
00:37:54.410 --> 00:37:55.790
And Cause I was getting,

1480
00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:56.540
I'm like,

1481
00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:58.100
I'll fucking drop both of you.

1482
00:37:58.101 --> 00:37:58.461
I'm like,

1483
00:37:58.461 --> 00:37:59.294
I'll do it.

1484
00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:00.193
And uh,

1485
00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:02.870
I mean well that's Florida.

1486
00:38:02.930 --> 00:38:07.930
That sounds like a coke move our Florida to talk some shit and make up a story.

1487
00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:10.280
But you'd be remember may fighter.

1488
00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:11.481
What if the guy was like,

1489
00:38:11.481 --> 00:38:12.314
who do you fight for?

1490
00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:13.670
I was just,

1491
00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:16.460
I was doing anything to save myself from fighting because I was like,

1492
00:38:16.490 --> 00:38:20.600
I do not want to fight these two guys because my thing is I never want to go to

1493
00:38:20.601 --> 00:38:21.410
jail.

1494
00:38:21.410 --> 00:38:22.243
I'm not,

1495
00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:23.750
I'm claustrophobic.

1496
00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:26.030
I don't want to a line of cops don't know the whole story.

1497
00:38:26.031 --> 00:38:26.631
Exactly.

1498
00:38:26.631 --> 00:38:30.830
You don't know if the guy's going to be a friend of the cops in a small town

1499
00:38:30.831 --> 00:38:32.240
like that easily.

1500
00:38:32.241 --> 00:38:33.810
The cops could beat the fuck out of you for,

1501
00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:36.340
and I had just heard that about a comedian

1502
00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:38.730
<v 4>that was there a few weeks ago who,</v>

1503
00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:39.690
it's very funny story.

1504
00:38:40.170 --> 00:38:41.590
You got to name this guy or no,

1505
00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:42.820
you mother fucker.

1506
00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:43.780
You full of half story.

1507
00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:44.411
I'll tell it.

1508
00:38:44.411 --> 00:38:48.010
I don't think he'll care even if it was Jeff Dye and Jeff.

1509
00:38:48.011 --> 00:38:48.161
Dot.

1510
00:38:48.161 --> 00:38:50.170
He's a good guy and he's a funny guy and he,

1511
00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:50.640
he,

1512
00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:53.260
he was on last comic standing and he's got a show on MTV.

1513
00:38:53.261 --> 00:38:54.094
But Jeff,

1514
00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:56.290
they stole some,

1515
00:38:56.530 --> 00:39:00.100
they were like some bar after the show and they stole a jersey,

1516
00:39:00.250 --> 00:39:02.660
like Frame Jersey off the wall,

1517
00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:04.900
took it back to the Condo,

1518
00:39:05.110 --> 00:39:06.580
had these chicks were in it,

1519
00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:08.400
taking pictures of it every,

1520
00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:09.970
putting it on Instagram,

1521
00:39:09.971 --> 00:39:11.020
putting on everywhere.

1522
00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:12.430
Then the,

1523
00:39:12.431 --> 00:39:12.701
the,

1524
00:39:12.701 --> 00:39:13.270
the,

1525
00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:14.830
the bar called the cops.

1526
00:39:14.831 --> 00:39:16.060
Cops got involved.

1527
00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:16.550
They,

1528
00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:16.900
they,

1529
00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:17.890
they bring it back.

1530
00:39:17.891 --> 00:39:19.240
They apologized and everything.

1531
00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:22.480
So show Sunday night they go back to the bar after the show,

1532
00:39:22.481 --> 00:39:23.560
they take it again.

1533
00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:24.873
What?

1534
00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:27.880
Fly with it to la once,

1535
00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:34.320
put it back on Instagram and then all this shit happen again and they had to

1536
00:39:35.171 --> 00:39:36.010
send it back.

1537
00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:37.090
Oh my God.

1538
00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:38.220
But that happens.

1539
00:39:38.290 --> 00:39:39.400
That happened two weeks ago.

1540
00:39:39.401 --> 00:39:40.480
So in my head I'm like,

1541
00:39:40.481 --> 00:39:43.570
these cops aren't going to not going to like a comedian in the parking lot.

1542
00:39:43.810 --> 00:39:44.500
Oh yeah.

1543
00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:45.220
Starting to fight.

1544
00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:45.880
Yeah.

1545
00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:47.020
That's just move.

1546
00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:51.050
<v 1>Jeff Dye was the one that attacked Tony Hinchcliffe ones on on Twitter,</v>

1547
00:39:51.110 --> 00:39:53.300
calling him out saying they attacked him about what?

1548
00:39:53.301 --> 00:39:54.134
His comedy.

1549
00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:54.650
Really?

1550
00:39:54.650 --> 00:39:54.860
Yeah.

1551
00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:56.030
What about it was,

1552
00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:57.201
it was so long ago,

1553
00:39:57.201 --> 00:39:59.270
but we did a podcast all about it.

1554
00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:01.460
It was something I didn't like.

1555
00:40:01.461 --> 00:40:03.170
It was something like a Tony,

1556
00:40:03.171 --> 00:40:05.060
if you know Tony's a comedy,

1557
00:40:05.061 --> 00:40:06.530
it's very sarcastic,

1558
00:40:06.531 --> 00:40:07.880
very dry,

1559
00:40:07.881 --> 00:40:11.770
very like almost like a Jeffrey Ross the burn cause he,

1560
00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:12.780
that's what he does for a living.

1561
00:40:12.781 --> 00:40:16.910
He writes for it and he said something like he was having like a weird set and

1562
00:40:16.911 --> 00:40:17.960
then Tony said something like,

1563
00:40:18.210 --> 00:40:21.380
you know too like I know I'm a great comedian so fuck you.

1564
00:40:21.381 --> 00:40:22.214
Or something like that.

1565
00:40:22.250 --> 00:40:23.083
I'm sarcastic.

1566
00:40:23.330 --> 00:40:23.701
And Jeff,

1567
00:40:23.701 --> 00:40:25.370
Jeff started like tweeting things like,

1568
00:40:25.371 --> 00:40:25.881
Tony,

1569
00:40:25.881 --> 00:40:28.040
you your ego this or something like that.

1570
00:40:28.041 --> 00:40:28.671
I can't remember,

1571
00:40:28.671 --> 00:40:30.670
but it was in a podcast.

1572
00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:32.660
We did an ice house chronicles the day it happened.

1573
00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:33.500
Uh,

1574
00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:35.050
and yeah.

1575
00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:39.110
<v 7>Do you know when some situations like that happen when a guy just decides to</v>

1576
00:40:39.111 --> 00:40:40.870
like go after another comedian?

1577
00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:41.111
Right.

1578
00:40:41.111 --> 00:40:41.680
That's what I know.

1579
00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:42.491
It's kind of weird.

1580
00:40:42.491 --> 00:40:43.240
Why would you do that?

1581
00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:43.541
It's a,

1582
00:40:43.541 --> 00:40:45.610
it's a douchebag detecting device.

1583
00:40:45.850 --> 00:40:46.661
That's what it is.

1584
00:40:46.661 --> 00:40:48.580
It's like when the guy flares up like that,

1585
00:40:48.581 --> 00:40:48.761
like,

1586
00:40:48.761 --> 00:40:48.911
Oh,

1587
00:40:48.911 --> 00:40:50.380
you've been trying to hold that Douche bag down,

1588
00:40:50.381 --> 00:40:51.610
I'm having you look,

1589
00:40:51.611 --> 00:40:52.444
it just flared.

1590
00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:56.200
He saw a guy say something and he decided it was time to cut it out.

1591
00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:58.080
I'm amazed when guys do it because I,

1592
00:40:58.140 --> 00:40:58.390
well,

1593
00:40:58.390 --> 00:41:01.060
I've always been under the impression that like if I don't like you,

1594
00:41:01.061 --> 00:41:01.541
I'll say,

1595
00:41:01.541 --> 00:41:04.210
I don't like to your like a guy's bombing.

1596
00:41:04.211 --> 00:41:04.571
And he says,

1597
00:41:04.571 --> 00:41:05.770
I know I'm a great comedian,

1598
00:41:05.890 --> 00:41:06.760
so fuck you guys.

1599
00:41:06.761 --> 00:41:10.540
That's kind of a funny thing to say and you just decided to go and attack him.

1600
00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:11.350
Why are you doing?

1601
00:41:11.350 --> 00:41:12.700
You're doing it because you're insecure.

1602
00:41:12.730 --> 00:41:13.390
That's the only,

1603
00:41:13.390 --> 00:41:17.560
the only reason why anybody does it was kind of a code of ethics among comics to

1604
00:41:17.561 --> 00:41:18.371
not go after each other.

1605
00:41:18.371 --> 00:41:19.070
Like,

1606
00:41:19.070 --> 00:41:19.330
well,

1607
00:41:19.330 --> 00:41:21.250
especially when you're fucking around.

1608
00:41:21.490 --> 00:41:21.761
You know,

1609
00:41:21.761 --> 00:41:22.001
I've,

1610
00:41:22.001 --> 00:41:25.780
I've heard people talk shit about guys that went on stage and we're trying out

1611
00:41:25.781 --> 00:41:28.240
new material and new material fucking socked.

1612
00:41:28.241 --> 00:41:29.074
It was terrible.

1613
00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:31.450
Like how about you don't even write any new material.

1614
00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:32.050
All right,

1615
00:41:32.050 --> 00:41:33.980
you're making fun of a guy who was up there and you know,

1616
00:41:33.981 --> 00:41:35.060
maybe it didn't go well,

1617
00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:35.451
you know,

1618
00:41:35.451 --> 00:41:37.340
maybe tried some shit down and didn't go well,

1619
00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:38.570
but what the fuck man,

1620
00:41:38.571 --> 00:41:39.200
you know,

1621
00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:41.630
for you to you pretending you don't know what that's like.

1622
00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:42.650
What does it say?

1623
00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:43.281
Here's what he said.

1624
00:41:43.281 --> 00:41:47.180
And the winner for the most disgusting display of arrogance is Tony Hinchcliffe

1625
00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:48.590
false sense of fame,

1626
00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:50.090
all what's raw.

1627
00:41:50.110 --> 00:41:50.810
And Tony says,

1628
00:41:50.810 --> 00:41:51.561
oh well what's wrong?

1629
00:41:51.561 --> 00:41:52.340
How'd he pants?

1630
00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:53.173
And then he wrote back,

1631
00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:53.721
Tony,

1632
00:41:53.721 --> 00:41:55.720
you told the crowd I tape TV today,

1633
00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:56.690
so if this goes bad,

1634
00:41:56.691 --> 00:41:57.260
fuck you.

1635
00:41:57.260 --> 00:41:58.093
That's funny.

1636
00:41:59.230 --> 00:41:59.570
That's,

1637
00:41:59.570 --> 00:42:00.160
that's like,

1638
00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:00.831
that's the same,

1639
00:42:00.831 --> 00:42:01.570
it's a joke.

1640
00:42:01.570 --> 00:42:02.060
That's,

1641
00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:02.600
yeah,

1642
00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:03.291
exactly.

1643
00:42:03.291 --> 00:42:06.830
That sounds exactly what I tell Tony Change cliff does his whole act sounds like

1644
00:42:06.831 --> 00:42:07.780
there was more though.

1645
00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:08.720
It's behind that.

1646
00:42:09.110 --> 00:42:09.261
No,

1647
00:42:09.261 --> 00:42:09.681
there wasn't.

1648
00:42:09.681 --> 00:42:10.311
I asked Tony,

1649
00:42:10.311 --> 00:42:10.581
he's like,

1650
00:42:10.581 --> 00:42:11.710
I don't even really,

1651
00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:12.741
well,

1652
00:42:12.741 --> 00:42:14.720
Tony's gotten notoriety right now.

1653
00:42:14.721 --> 00:42:14.871
You know,

1654
00:42:14.871 --> 00:42:15.920
he's working for the burns.

1655
00:42:15.921 --> 00:42:16.460
Doing well.

1656
00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:17.420
That was one thing that I,

1657
00:42:17.421 --> 00:42:21.200
I've always noticed whenever a comic would break away from the pack,

1658
00:42:21.201 --> 00:42:24.410
you would always see a lot of guys talking shit about them.

1659
00:42:24.650 --> 00:42:26.180
Especially in the early days,

1660
00:42:26.181 --> 00:42:29.360
like the first guys to get sitcoms and you know,

1661
00:42:29.361 --> 00:42:30.970
and the first guys to like get Pete.

1662
00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:33.020
I remember having conversations with people and I'm like,

1663
00:42:33.021 --> 00:42:34.490
why do you care?

1664
00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:38.450
Like how does it affect you if this guy is not funny but he's doing really well.

1665
00:42:38.970 --> 00:42:40.210
Somebody always selects them.

1666
00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:41.120
I've always,

1667
00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:42.950
whenever I feel anger towards the comedian,

1668
00:42:42.951 --> 00:42:44.690
I always try to look at myself and say,

1669
00:42:45.050 --> 00:42:48.740
am I angry at them or I'm angry at myself because I'm not doing what they're

1670
00:42:48.741 --> 00:42:49.310
doing.

1671
00:42:49.310 --> 00:42:50.780
My angry cause I don't have the Sitcom.

1672
00:42:50.781 --> 00:42:51.291
Am I angry?

1673
00:42:51.291 --> 00:42:52.124
Because,

1674
00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:57.230
because I'm not for sure there's that and you don't want for sure that people

1675
00:42:57.231 --> 00:42:58.580
have different tastes too.

1676
00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:00.500
And if I don't like something,

1677
00:43:00.501 --> 00:43:01.660
it doesn't mean it's not good.

1678
00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:05.120
Like I was in a car the other day and some guy tried to play some band for me,

1679
00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:05.870
you know,

1680
00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:07.400
and he's playing it loud.

1681
00:43:07.410 --> 00:43:07.670
I'm like,

1682
00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:08.503
Oh my God,

1683
00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:10.640
I'm going to open this door and jump.

1684
00:43:10.970 --> 00:43:11.331
I'm like,

1685
00:43:11.331 --> 00:43:12.440
this is terrible.

1686
00:43:12.441 --> 00:43:13.790
This music is terrible.

1687
00:43:13.970 --> 00:43:14.430
And he's like,

1688
00:43:14.430 --> 00:43:16.160
they're cool new indie band from Seattle.

1689
00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:16.431
I'm like,

1690
00:43:16.431 --> 00:43:17.390
they need to stop.

1691
00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:19.160
They need to stop right now.

1692
00:43:19.161 --> 00:43:19.371
I'm like,

1693
00:43:19.371 --> 00:43:20.600
this is nails on a chalkboard.

1694
00:43:20.601 --> 00:43:24.200
But to him this was like some cool shit that he wanted to play me.

1695
00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:24.981
You know,

1696
00:43:24.981 --> 00:43:26.150
and I look,

1697
00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:28.280
Eddie Bravo doesn't like Leonard Skinner.

1698
00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:29.181
Okay.

1699
00:43:29.181 --> 00:43:30.270
I try to play some lanterns,

1700
00:43:30.271 --> 00:43:30.830
Kenny for every,

1701
00:43:30.830 --> 00:43:32.210
and he probably doesn't want to hear Lance,

1702
00:43:32.211 --> 00:43:32.810
Karen,

1703
00:43:32.810 --> 00:43:32.991
I,

1704
00:43:32.991 --> 00:43:33.201
you know,

1705
00:43:33.201 --> 00:43:34.730
I can play it for already fear.

1706
00:43:34.731 --> 00:43:35.720
Who's got like the shittiest,

1707
00:43:35.810 --> 00:43:37.370
he likes Lana del Ray and he'll,

1708
00:43:37.371 --> 00:43:38.960
he only listens to it when he's naked,

1709
00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:40.430
but like his,

1710
00:43:40.431 --> 00:43:41.360
his sense of music,

1711
00:43:41.370 --> 00:43:42.950
I'm not into his type of music,

1712
00:43:43.130 --> 00:43:45.560
but I can play him some Leonard Skinner and least you can understand it.

1713
00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:46.100
Well,

1714
00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:49.700
Bravo was like my best friend doesn't even like Laird skin.

1715
00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:53.060
I think people are more understandable understanding about that with music.

1716
00:43:53.061 --> 00:43:54.020
They're not with comedy.

1717
00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:55.533
He's bat that.

1718
00:43:55.610 --> 00:43:56.361
People always say to me,

1719
00:43:56.361 --> 00:43:56.901
is he funny?

1720
00:43:56.901 --> 00:43:57.400
And I go,

1721
00:43:57.400 --> 00:43:57.510
yeah,

1722
00:43:57.510 --> 00:43:58.520
it's not my thing,

1723
00:43:58.910 --> 00:44:00.090
but I'm not going to say if he's bad,

1724
00:44:00.110 --> 00:44:02.540
he's not funny or not when he's not musical.

1725
00:44:02.570 --> 00:44:06.260
It's like one of the things that comes up when you're developing an act and in

1726
00:44:06.261 --> 00:44:09.140
developing an audience is like when you first go on stage,

1727
00:44:09.141 --> 00:44:12.620
like the first year is like the first 10 plus years of your comedy career.

1728
00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:15.410
Most likely the people who have no idea who the fuck you are.

1729
00:44:15.830 --> 00:44:16.970
And so you,

1730
00:44:16.971 --> 00:44:20.630
although you might have your own shit that you would like to talk about,

1731
00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:25.780
you got to like get into their head first with some fairly neutral or homogenous

1732
00:44:26.961 --> 00:44:31.070
or confidence building stuff so that then you could take them into deeper waters

1733
00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:31.861
once they already,

1734
00:44:31.861 --> 00:44:32.910
like you said,

1735
00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:35.970
it will take like a lot longer to like get to it.

1736
00:44:36.330 --> 00:44:36.511
You know?

1737
00:44:36.511 --> 00:44:37.080
So this is like,

1738
00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:41.100
there's a benefit like as a comic to that and that benefit is that you're

1739
00:44:41.101 --> 00:44:45.510
learning how to craft material and you're learning how to pull people in.

1740
00:44:45.511 --> 00:44:49.170
You're learning how to like how to not lose him with controversial stuff.

1741
00:44:49.171 --> 00:44:52.620
In the beginning that would work if you did it 1520 minutes in instead of like

1742
00:44:52.621 --> 00:44:53.454
your first bit.

1743
00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:54.301
You know?

1744
00:44:54.301 --> 00:44:59.301
And I think that a lot of times when you're seeing like a new and upcoming

1745
00:44:59.851 --> 00:45:00.511
Comedians,

1746
00:45:00.511 --> 00:45:00.661
man,

1747
00:45:00.661 --> 00:45:03.030
there's a lot of frustration going on.

1748
00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:06.450
There's a lot of like rejection and there's a lot of like,

1749
00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:09.270
everybody's trying to put it together and get something to happen.

1750
00:45:09.271 --> 00:45:10.920
So there's all this fucking tension.

1751
00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:15.960
So when a guy like Tony Hinchcliffe is doing good fucking arrogant fucking

1752
00:45:15.961 --> 00:45:16.480
bullshit,

1753
00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:18.000
or how long has [inaudible] been around?

1754
00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:19.673
Not that long.

1755
00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:20.813
Not that long.

1756
00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:21.600
Yeah.

1757
00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:22.590
He's fucking good man.

1758
00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:23.011
I'll tell you,

1759
00:45:23.011 --> 00:45:24.360
I took that kid to Indianapolis.

1760
00:45:24.570 --> 00:45:25.980
He was really funny.

1761
00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:26.130
Yeah.

1762
00:45:26.130 --> 00:45:26.470
He's,

1763
00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:27.330
he made me laugh.

1764
00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:30.990
He destroyed in La Jolla this week ad Lib in a bunch of Shit,

1765
00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:31.410
uh,

1766
00:45:31.410 --> 00:45:32.021
about the,

1767
00:45:32.021 --> 00:45:32.880
the situation,

1768
00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:34.073
something that happened.

1769
00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:37.080
I've only seen him or on the ice house chronicles.

1770
00:45:37.081 --> 00:45:37.740
I did,

1771
00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:38.610
or I did a,

1772
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.650
when we sat there and he was doing a lot of,

1773
00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:41.820
he did impressions.

1774
00:45:42.090 --> 00:45:42.220
Oh,

1775
00:45:42.220 --> 00:45:42.630
he is,

1776
00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:44.820
he does a lot of Brody impression,

1777
00:45:44.850 --> 00:45:46.050
but they were like dead on.

1778
00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:47.243
He's good.

1779
00:45:47.850 --> 00:45:48.421
Like dead.

1780
00:45:48.421 --> 00:45:48.531
Oh,

1781
00:45:48.531 --> 00:45:49.290
he's a funny kid.

1782
00:45:49.290 --> 00:45:52.410
I always liked comics that can do impressions of other comics that no one like

1783
00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:54.300
not like this other guy,

1784
00:45:54.330 --> 00:45:54.721
you know,

1785
00:45:54.721 --> 00:45:55.590
he's just frustrated.

1786
00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:56.641
That's what it is.

1787
00:45:56.641 --> 00:45:58.600
It's just that's it's a part of,

1788
00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:02.100
and you know what the field is sting of being recognized for being up kind of a

1789
00:46:02.101 --> 00:46:02.934
country bitch.

1790
00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:03.331
You know what,

1791
00:46:03.331 --> 00:46:04.001
when something like that,

1792
00:46:04.001 --> 00:46:05.310
cause that's good for your personality,

1793
00:46:05.311 --> 00:46:07.950
you need to know that that type of behavior is loathsome.

1794
00:46:08.310 --> 00:46:10.080
And then when people read shit like that,

1795
00:46:10.081 --> 00:46:10.410
they,

1796
00:46:10.410 --> 00:46:13.740
they lashed back at you because they know exactly what you're really doing.

1797
00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:14.550
I had it when I,

1798
00:46:14.550 --> 00:46:16.530
when I first started comedy and I was in New York,

1799
00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:18.480
I got a lot of shit too early,

1800
00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:19.830
like way too early.

1801
00:46:19.831 --> 00:46:20.660
Like a lot of shit.

1802
00:46:20.660 --> 00:46:20.931
Oh No,

1803
00:46:20.931 --> 00:46:21.091
like,

1804
00:46:21.091 --> 00:46:24.420
like festivals and TV shows and your cute little fellow.

1805
00:46:24.570 --> 00:46:27.660
But I didn't deserve it and everyone let me know it,

1806
00:46:27.810 --> 00:46:30.360
you know all the comments and let me know it's no,

1807
00:46:30.361 --> 00:46:31.680
there's no deserve it.

1808
00:46:31.681 --> 00:46:32.970
You know you get a shot,

1809
00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:34.890
you get a lottery ticket pops up,

1810
00:46:34.891 --> 00:46:35.670
you grab it,

1811
00:46:35.670 --> 00:46:38.130
there's no deserve it because what do you really,

1812
00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:39.420
what is the shot for?

1813
00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:41.940
Is the shot for you doing a sitcom?

1814
00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:42.661
Cause if it is,

1815
00:46:42.661 --> 00:46:43.494
guess what?

1816
00:46:43.530 --> 00:46:44.460
Anybody can do that.

1817
00:46:44.970 --> 00:46:46.590
It could get comic that's sucks.

1818
00:46:46.830 --> 00:46:48.510
His common could be terrible,

1819
00:46:48.511 --> 00:46:50.460
but if you write good lines from an a sitcom,

1820
00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:51.473
you could do it.

1821
00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:56.130
I was funnier on news radio than I wasn't my real act when I first started doing

1822
00:46:56.131 --> 00:46:58.410
news radio 94 that wasn't that good of a comedian.

1823
00:46:58.680 --> 00:46:59.250
I don't know.

1824
00:46:59.250 --> 00:46:59.641
I don't know.

1825
00:46:59.641 --> 00:47:00.474
I saw you.

1826
00:47:00.570 --> 00:47:01.381
I always say this.

1827
00:47:01.381 --> 00:47:03.930
I saw you I think before I started doing stand up,

1828
00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:09.380
I saw you Sarah Silverman and I forget who it was on Caroline's comedy hour and

1829
00:47:11.310 --> 00:47:16.310
it changed comedy for me because you guys were dirty and I never saw a dirty on

1830
00:47:16.711 --> 00:47:17.544
TV.

1831
00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:21.660
Like you couldn't be dirt and I couldn't believe the Shit Sarah was saying.

1832
00:47:21.661 --> 00:47:23.280
I couldn't believe what you were saying.

1833
00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:24.293
And I was like,

1834
00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:26.160
oh I think I want to do this now.

1835
00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:27.650
Like the fact that this is what,

1836
00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:28.800
this is what I talk about.

1837
00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:29.840
Let me rephrase that.

1838
00:47:29.841 --> 00:47:32.900
I had probably like 20 good minutes of fuck jokes,

1839
00:47:34.250 --> 00:47:35.420
but it wasn't a real comic.

1840
00:47:35.421 --> 00:47:36.254
You know what I'm saying?

1841
00:47:36.410 --> 00:47:37.243
Headline,

1842
00:47:37.550 --> 00:47:38.001
headline.

1843
00:47:38.001 --> 00:47:38.900
But realistically,

1844
00:47:38.901 --> 00:47:40.610
did I really have an hour and not really.

1845
00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:41.180
I had,

1846
00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:41.870
you know,

1847
00:47:41.870 --> 00:47:42.561
I had an hour,

1848
00:47:42.561 --> 00:47:44.390
but 40 minutes of it probably sucked.

1849
00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:45.530
I had known I had to,

1850
00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:46.880
I headlined way before I should.

1851
00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:47.991
Absolutely.

1852
00:47:47.991 --> 00:47:48.770
We all did.

1853
00:47:48.770 --> 00:47:49.071
I mean,

1854
00:47:49.071 --> 00:47:49.581
I could,

1855
00:47:49.581 --> 00:47:51.350
was capable of doing an hour,

1856
00:47:51.350 --> 00:47:51.580
an hour,

1857
00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:52.520
like a year in.

1858
00:47:52.730 --> 00:47:53.720
But was it a good hour?

1859
00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:53.991
No,

1860
00:47:53.991 --> 00:47:54.681
it was dog shit.

1861
00:47:54.681 --> 00:47:55.200
It was terrible.

1862
00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:59.280
<v 4>My Third Gig ever a guy took me to Dan Rosenberg.</v>

1863
00:47:59.670 --> 00:48:00.241
Uh,

1864
00:48:00.241 --> 00:48:00.630
he's,

1865
00:48:00.630 --> 00:48:02.010
I still see him around sometimes.

1866
00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:02.910
Dan Rosenberg,

1867
00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:04.080
I was living in Pittsburgh.

1868
00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:04.771
He goes,

1869
00:48:04.771 --> 00:48:05.604
hey,

1870
00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:06.810
you want to open for me?

1871
00:48:06.870 --> 00:48:07.411
And I said,

1872
00:48:07.411 --> 00:48:07.890
yeah,

1873
00:48:07.890 --> 00:48:08.161
you know,

1874
00:48:08.161 --> 00:48:09.030
I was doing,

1875
00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:09.720
uh,

1876
00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:11.760
like open mic spots at the funny bone in Pittsburgh.

1877
00:48:11.970 --> 00:48:12.181
He goes,

1878
00:48:12.181 --> 00:48:12.421
all right,

1879
00:48:12.421 --> 00:48:13.560
we're going to oil city.

1880
00:48:13.561 --> 00:48:14.910
We're playing this VFW.

1881
00:48:15.210 --> 00:48:15.541
And I was like,

1882
00:48:15.541 --> 00:48:15.841
all right,

1883
00:48:15.841 --> 00:48:16.501
we get there.

1884
00:48:16.501 --> 00:48:16.951
And he goes,

1885
00:48:16.951 --> 00:48:18.210
so you're going to do 30,

1886
00:48:18.211 --> 00:48:20.520
35 and uh,

1887
00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:21.900
I'll do 45 to an hour.

1888
00:48:21.901 --> 00:48:22.734
And I went,

1889
00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:24.210
how,

1890
00:48:24.210 --> 00:48:25.043
how long?

1891
00:48:25.230 --> 00:48:26.063
And he goes,

1892
00:48:26.330 --> 00:48:26.881
30 minutes.

1893
00:48:26.881 --> 00:48:27.770
You got 30 minutes.

1894
00:48:27.771 --> 00:48:28.604
I went,

1895
00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:29.640
I got five.

1896
00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:33.170
<v 7>Oh my God.</v>

1897
00:48:33.650 --> 00:48:33.951
Oh,

1898
00:48:33.951 --> 00:48:34.671
that's a horrible,

1899
00:48:34.671 --> 00:48:36.570
it's a person doesn't understand how terrifying.

1900
00:48:37.490 --> 00:48:38.211
That's a terrible,

1901
00:48:38.211 --> 00:48:38.961
terrible feeling.

1902
00:48:38.961 --> 00:48:40.230
Wrote jokes right there.

1903
00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:41.660
He's writing them.

1904
00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:42.381
So my point is,

1905
00:48:42.381 --> 00:48:43.400
when someone was giving you shit,

1906
00:48:43.401 --> 00:48:44.780
if they were giving you shit saying that,

1907
00:48:44.781 --> 00:48:45.051
you know,

1908
00:48:45.051 --> 00:48:46.220
you shouldn't have got that so,

1909
00:48:46.250 --> 00:48:47.000
so soon,

1910
00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:47.750
stop it.

1911
00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:49.040
That doesn't mean nobody should have,

1912
00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:50.240
what if it's a six?

1913
00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:51.740
<v 4>Well that's what you ate it all.</v>

1914
00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:52.420
So you gotta know,

1915
00:48:52.420 --> 00:48:54.520
I came up through the comedy cellar in New York,

1916
00:48:54.550 --> 00:48:54.970
right?

1917
00:48:54.970 --> 00:48:59.970
With all the guys from tough crowd and that sense of humor of just shitting on

1918
00:49:00.101 --> 00:49:00.581
each other.

1919
00:49:00.581 --> 00:49:01.060
It's great.

1920
00:49:01.060 --> 00:49:03.940
And they fucking tear Patrice.

1921
00:49:03.950 --> 00:49:05.430
O'Neil used to,

1922
00:49:05.650 --> 00:49:06.483
uh,

1923
00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:07.780
I would see Patrice.

1924
00:49:07.810 --> 00:49:08.880
I would walk in the club up.

1925
00:49:08.890 --> 00:49:09.723
I saw Patrice.

1926
00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:13.810
I would go back out and go downstairs and come in the other way.

1927
00:49:13.811 --> 00:49:14.850
Cause you didn't want to fucking with you.

1928
00:49:14.851 --> 00:49:15.160
Oh,

1929
00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:17.140
he would just fucking kill me.

1930
00:49:18.130 --> 00:49:18.963
He was hilarious.

1931
00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:20.910
<v 7>But it's like when he fucks with you,</v>

1932
00:49:20.911 --> 00:49:21.780
it's like an honor,

1933
00:49:22.050 --> 00:49:22.381
you know,

1934
00:49:22.381 --> 00:49:23.214
it's fun.

1935
00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:27.480
It's like people who are not comics will probably never understand that way of

1936
00:49:27.481 --> 00:49:28.470
interacting with each other.

1937
00:49:29.010 --> 00:49:29.191
<v 4>Well,</v>

1938
00:49:29.191 --> 00:49:29.910
I walked in,

1939
00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:31.560
we used to do the roasts in New York City.

1940
00:49:31.561 --> 00:49:32.640
That's like kind of where,

1941
00:49:32.641 --> 00:49:33.810
I mean they'd always done roasts,

1942
00:49:33.811 --> 00:49:34.531
but the,

1943
00:49:34.531 --> 00:49:37.890
the kind of reinvention of the roast happened through,

1944
00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:38.551
you know,

1945
00:49:38.551 --> 00:49:39.331
all those guys,

1946
00:49:39.331 --> 00:49:40.950
Geraldo and all these guys in New York.

1947
00:49:41.130 --> 00:49:42.510
And the first one I went to,

1948
00:49:42.511 --> 00:49:45.060
I think it might've been for Barry Katz or for,

1949
00:49:45.450 --> 00:49:46.620
I forget who it was for,

1950
00:49:46.770 --> 00:49:51.420
but I walk in and rich Vos is hosting it and I walk in and I sit down.

1951
00:49:51.421 --> 00:49:52.260
I'm all excited.

1952
00:49:52.261 --> 00:49:54.450
I'm at the roast and he opens and he goes,

1953
00:49:54.451 --> 00:49:58.200
I'd like to thank all the comedians and Eddie gift for being here tonight.

1954
00:49:59.100 --> 00:50:01.110
And I just fucking melted.

1955
00:50:01.770 --> 00:50:03.960
I was just shitting myself.

1956
00:50:04.050 --> 00:50:07.410
And then they hit me like four more times during the roast.

1957
00:50:07.590 --> 00:50:09.030
And a rich vos would go.

1958
00:50:09.031 --> 00:50:09.360
Yeah.

1959
00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:09.780
Uh,

1960
00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:13.110
apparently IDF just got another development deal or his parents just gave him

1961
00:50:13.111 --> 00:50:15.840
some more money and he was just killing me.

1962
00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:17.040
And then Bill Burr,

1963
00:50:17.070 --> 00:50:18.930
they all fucking smashed me.

1964
00:50:19.470 --> 00:50:20.520
And I remember like,

1965
00:50:20.550 --> 00:50:21.570
I was going to cry.

1966
00:50:21.571 --> 00:50:21.770
Like,

1967
00:50:21.770 --> 00:50:22.710
it hurts so bad.

1968
00:50:22.711 --> 00:50:23.544
Oh,

1969
00:50:23.550 --> 00:50:25.050
you pussy more or less.

1970
00:50:25.051 --> 00:50:27.000
And I'm walking out and Tony Woods grabbed me.

1971
00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:27.741
You know Tony Woods?

1972
00:50:27.741 --> 00:50:27.940
Yeah,

1973
00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:28.310
sure.

1974
00:50:28.310 --> 00:50:28.821
<v 5>Tony goes,</v>

1975
00:50:28.821 --> 00:50:29.331
dog,

1976
00:50:29.331 --> 00:50:30.081
what are you doing?

1977
00:50:30.081 --> 00:50:30.950
Why are you upset?

1978
00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:31.700
And I go,

1979
00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:33.380
they just smashed me.

1980
00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:34.393
And he goes,

1981
00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:34.731
dude,

1982
00:50:34.731 --> 00:50:35.810
they're talking about you.

1983
00:50:35.811 --> 00:50:37.130
Where did you start doing comedy?

1984
00:50:37.220 --> 00:50:38.360
I started in Pittsburgh.

1985
00:50:38.390 --> 00:50:40.490
I was there for about nine months and decided,

1986
00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:41.300
you know,

1987
00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:43.010
I don't want to be in Pittsburgh,

1988
00:50:43.011 --> 00:50:46.040
so why are we having a hard time with the wig comic's role in New York?

1989
00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:48.080
Because I've went to New York and uh,

1990
00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:49.100
he didn't know anybody like that.

1991
00:50:49.130 --> 00:50:50.130
I didn't know one of,

1992
00:50:50.170 --> 00:50:50.451
no,

1993
00:50:50.451 --> 00:50:50.961
not really.

1994
00:50:50.961 --> 00:50:52.190
Pittsburgh wasn't like that.

1995
00:50:52.191 --> 00:50:52.880
And uh,

1996
00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:54.800
I went to New York and they just beat late.

1997
00:50:54.870 --> 00:50:55.760
It's Boston.

1998
00:50:55.820 --> 00:50:57.770
It's Boston to Boston was ruthless.

1999
00:50:57.771 --> 00:50:59.060
Patrice and bill birth,

2000
00:50:59.450 --> 00:51:00.560
both of them from Boston.

2001
00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:01.400
That's,

2002
00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:02.310
that's the,

2003
00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:03.890
those are fucking drunk fishermen.

2004
00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:04.790
But I like,

2005
00:51:04.791 --> 00:51:06.680
I have that now and you know,

2006
00:51:06.681 --> 00:51:10.280
I develop that from them and I do it to people and I forget how sensitive

2007
00:51:10.281 --> 00:51:10.590
people,

2008
00:51:10.590 --> 00:51:10.821
I mean,

2009
00:51:10.821 --> 00:51:14.360
I just had a guy quit my podcast because I was always fucking with them.

2010
00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:17.300
And Will you look your guy you worked with any,

2011
00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:20.990
but I fuck with everyone and I don't realize how sensitive people are.

2012
00:51:21.050 --> 00:51:22.070
Comics like it,

2013
00:51:22.290 --> 00:51:22.550
you know,

2014
00:51:22.550 --> 00:51:22.700
like,

2015
00:51:22.700 --> 00:51:23.720
can you love it now?

2016
00:51:23.721 --> 00:51:26.900
He and Joey Diaz will start fucking with each other sometimes insulting each

2017
00:51:26.901 --> 00:51:27.141
other,

2018
00:51:27.141 --> 00:51:28.460
fake consulting each other.

2019
00:51:28.461 --> 00:51:29.390
It's so fun.

2020
00:51:30.110 --> 00:51:30.590
I was like,

2021
00:51:30.590 --> 00:51:30.951
what are you,

2022
00:51:30.951 --> 00:51:31.371
what are you doing?

2023
00:51:31.371 --> 00:51:31.880
Cock soccer.

2024
00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:33.680
You've got to fucking typo class to go through.

2025
00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:34.840
Sit the fuck down.

2026
00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:36.440
It'll say shit to you.

2027
00:51:36.650 --> 00:51:37.910
And Lillian Socio is funny.

2028
00:51:37.911 --> 00:51:38.810
What are you going to fucking kill?

2029
00:51:38.811 --> 00:51:39.650
Shake up your ass.

2030
00:51:40.020 --> 00:51:41.660
You're walking around like a fucking Momo.

2031
00:51:41.661 --> 00:51:42.494
Sit down.

2032
00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:44.480
I live for,

2033
00:51:44.481 --> 00:51:46.070
when I see rich Vos,

2034
00:51:46.071 --> 00:51:47.900
I just love to go head to head with.

2035
00:51:48.350 --> 00:51:49.190
It's fun.

2036
00:51:49.191 --> 00:51:49.671
It's fun.

2037
00:51:49.671 --> 00:51:50.331
I enjoy it.

2038
00:51:50.331 --> 00:51:51.080
It's fun.

2039
00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:51.770
You know,

2040
00:51:51.770 --> 00:51:54.800
I remember I was listening to opiate Anthony and they're talking about Louis C K

2041
00:51:54.801 --> 00:51:56.600
and Bobby Kelly or a Jim Norton.

2042
00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:59.570
We're talking about how comics it would interact with each other and no one

2043
00:51:59.571 --> 00:52:00.404
could ever understand it.

2044
00:52:00.530 --> 00:52:05.530
Jim Norton had a slice of pizza and Louis C k just slap the pizza out of his

2045
00:52:06.291 --> 00:52:06.531
hand.

2046
00:52:06.531 --> 00:52:09.590
It says something like your mother's account and just walk away.

2047
00:52:10.210 --> 00:52:14.510
And Norton just couldn't help but laugh and he ha he couldn't help a lab.

2048
00:52:14.540 --> 00:52:15.081
We just,

2049
00:52:15.081 --> 00:52:17.000
we used to do a thing at the cellar where you were,

2050
00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:19.700
if you were looking at anything on paper like it,

2051
00:52:19.701 --> 00:52:22.130
usually the lineup sheet is on the table.

2052
00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:23.360
If you were looking at it,

2053
00:52:23.420 --> 00:52:26.030
one of the other comics would grab it out of your hand and crumple it up and

2054
00:52:26.031 --> 00:52:26.864
throw it on the ground.

2055
00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:32.920
And so one night Tony Rock is reading a newspaper article and it's a review of

2056
00:52:33.681 --> 00:52:35.210
his show or something about him.

2057
00:52:35.450 --> 00:52:38.030
And Steve Byrne walks in,

2058
00:52:38.031 --> 00:52:38.511
grabs it,

2059
00:52:38.511 --> 00:52:41.990
crumples it up and throws it on the ground and Tony just punches him.

2060
00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:42.823
Right.

2061
00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:43.940
Oh my God.

2062
00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:47.030
Where was this at the last act of the seller and the seller.

2063
00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:47.451
I mean,

2064
00:52:47.451 --> 00:52:49.770
there was so much shit like that punched him in the face.

2065
00:52:49.810 --> 00:52:52.160
I like really like really hit them and uh,

2066
00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:53.053
they got into a fight.

2067
00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:53.691
No,

2068
00:52:53.691 --> 00:52:54.680
I mean they didn't fight after that.

2069
00:52:54.681 --> 00:52:55.311
Tony was bad.

2070
00:52:55.311 --> 00:52:55.971
I talked to Tony,

2071
00:52:55.971 --> 00:52:56.211
he's like,

2072
00:52:56.211 --> 00:52:58.590
it's the first time I was ever written up in the paper and uh,

2073
00:52:58.820 --> 00:52:59.270
you know,

2074
00:52:59.270 --> 00:53:00.860
Tony was a brand new comic and he gets,

2075
00:53:00.861 --> 00:53:02.240
he fucking crumpled it up.

2076
00:53:02.241 --> 00:53:02.930
And I'm like,

2077
00:53:02.930 --> 00:53:03.411
well,

2078
00:53:03.411 --> 00:53:04.160
you know,

2079
00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:04.800
but we had,

2080
00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:05.180
there's,

2081
00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:09.110
there's a thing at the comedy cellar table that says comics only like four.

2082
00:53:09.111 --> 00:53:10.760
There's a table just for the comedians.

2083
00:53:11.150 --> 00:53:14.000
And it was just every night they would do it to somebody.

2084
00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:17.210
You'd be sitting there and they grab it and they just put it in front of you.

2085
00:53:17.540 --> 00:53:19.550
The comics only table is a beautiful idea.

2086
00:53:19.620 --> 00:53:20.030
It is.

2087
00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:20.863
It's amazing.

2088
00:53:21.410 --> 00:53:23.120
It's the other way people can get to you though.

2089
00:53:23.570 --> 00:53:24.560
People do come around,

2090
00:53:24.561 --> 00:53:25.261
but that's what they do.

2091
00:53:25.261 --> 00:53:26.094
They'll put

2092
00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:27.780
<v 7>the little fig in front of them saying,</v>

2093
00:53:27.781 --> 00:53:28.031
come,

2094
00:53:28.031 --> 00:53:29.010
it's only like cold.

2095
00:53:30.270 --> 00:53:33.670
And so they do it to comics sometimes sit down and we'll go

2096
00:53:35.180 --> 00:53:36.330
stand like that.

2097
00:53:36.331 --> 00:53:37.021
Sounds rude.

2098
00:53:37.021 --> 00:53:39.840
But that's the environment required to do good comedy.

2099
00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:40.190
Yeah,

2100
00:53:40.190 --> 00:53:43.350
like you have to also be aware that if you do some cheesy,

2101
00:53:43.351 --> 00:53:44.130
stupid shit,

2102
00:53:44.130 --> 00:53:45.180
they're going to call you on it.

2103
00:53:45.390 --> 00:53:46.440
So you got to feel that.

2104
00:53:46.470 --> 00:53:48.010
You've got to feel that from those people in the room.

2105
00:53:48.011 --> 00:53:49.440
And that added pressure.

2106
00:53:49.710 --> 00:53:50.471
It makes you develop.

2107
00:53:50.471 --> 00:53:53.250
It was onstage there one night and you have to,

2108
00:53:53.251 --> 00:53:54.270
to get to the bathroom,

2109
00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:56.070
you have to walk past the stage.

2110
00:53:56.100 --> 00:53:57.750
You're literally one table back.

2111
00:53:57.751 --> 00:54:02.751
The row runs parallel to the stage and I'm doing my act and Jim Norton walks by

2112
00:54:02.821 --> 00:54:03.540
me,

2113
00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:05.910
looks at me and he's as far as you to me right now.

2114
00:54:05.911 --> 00:54:06.744
And he goes,

2115
00:54:06.810 --> 00:54:07.643
oh,

2116
00:54:10.140 --> 00:54:11.430
he goes to the bathroom,

2117
00:54:12.780 --> 00:54:14.010
comes back from the bathroom,

2118
00:54:14.730 --> 00:54:16.290
looks at me again and gets double.

2119
00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:17.193
Oh,

2120
00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:18.733
it just goes,

2121
00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:23.160
it's only fun for Comedians,

2122
00:54:23.161 --> 00:54:23.520
ma'am.

2123
00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:24.240
Regular people.

2124
00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:25.170
If you did that at work,

2125
00:54:25.470 --> 00:54:26.303
you'd get sued.

2126
00:54:26.710 --> 00:54:27.150
Yeah,

2127
00:54:27.150 --> 00:54:28.080
you'd get sued.

2128
00:54:28.081 --> 00:54:29.010
You would lose your Gig.

2129
00:54:29.550 --> 00:54:32.700
Maybe people fucking can't crack jokes at work,

2130
00:54:33.300 --> 00:54:33.631
you know?

2131
00:54:33.631 --> 00:54:34.050
And there's,

2132
00:54:34.050 --> 00:54:36.000
there's people that are annoying about that shit,

2133
00:54:36.210 --> 00:54:41.070
but there's a lot of like funny that gets cut out of the workplace.

2134
00:54:41.071 --> 00:54:42.980
Do you remember the water balloons at the comedy store too?

2135
00:54:44.890 --> 00:54:45.723
Um,

2136
00:54:45.810 --> 00:54:46.201
let's,

2137
00:54:46.201 --> 00:54:46.530
let's,

2138
00:54:46.530 --> 00:54:48.930
let's not talk about that as if it actually happened,

2139
00:54:50.070 --> 00:54:52.410
but wouldn't it be cool if somebody married have done that?

2140
00:54:52.650 --> 00:54:57.450
If somebody might have launched water balloons with a catapult off the comedy

2141
00:54:57.451 --> 00:55:02.310
store and flew them towards the sky bar where there was a bunch of assholes

2142
00:55:02.311 --> 00:55:06.020
waiting in line to get in and might have how I can,

2143
00:55:06.690 --> 00:55:10.620
anything funnier launched like 35 miles an hour.

2144
00:55:10.830 --> 00:55:11.131
I mean,

2145
00:55:11.131 --> 00:55:12.450
they hit the cars.

2146
00:55:12.530 --> 00:55:12.930
Yeah.

2147
00:55:12.930 --> 00:55:15.960
These people got hit in the head and their heads would snap back.

2148
00:55:16.020 --> 00:55:17.790
And these are like Paris Hilton's and stuff.

2149
00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:22.200
I was a have a new respect for everyone that was involved in that.

2150
00:55:22.260 --> 00:55:24.720
I was fortunately on the ground level,

2151
00:55:24.750 --> 00:55:27.510
so I heard screaming.

2152
00:55:28.380 --> 00:55:29.820
That's how I found that it was going on.

2153
00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:33.510
I heard screaming across the street and then I see this dude get hit in the

2154
00:55:33.511 --> 00:55:34.410
fucking head,

2155
00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:36.090
like the Zapruder film.

2156
00:55:36.450 --> 00:55:39.090
I mean his head snaps back.

2157
00:55:39.660 --> 00:55:40.230
So,

2158
00:55:40.230 --> 00:55:43.020
I mean it's a fucking court of water hit this dude in the face.

2159
00:55:43.710 --> 00:55:46.800
It was really kind of fucked up because they had this contract and this

2160
00:55:46.801 --> 00:55:47.790
allegedly had,

2161
00:55:48.210 --> 00:55:49.043
allegedly,

2162
00:55:49.230 --> 00:55:50.520
I don't even remember who was on the roof.

2163
00:55:50.521 --> 00:55:52.140
It was some employees though Julie,

2164
00:55:52.141 --> 00:55:54.090
who could get in trouble now allegedly,

2165
00:55:54.091 --> 00:55:55.200
I don't remember who it was.

2166
00:55:55.470 --> 00:55:56.071
And you know,

2167
00:55:56.071 --> 00:55:58.720
eye witness accounts are some of the worst pieces of evidence you're ever going

2168
00:55:58.721 --> 00:55:59.280
to come across.

2169
00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:00.690
So the reality is,

2170
00:56:00.691 --> 00:56:04.020
I honestly honestly do not remember exactly who did it.

2171
00:56:04.080 --> 00:56:05.100
It was some employee,

2172
00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:08.370
but you could like put in my mind it was this guy and I'd be like,

2173
00:56:08.371 --> 00:56:08.970
okay,

2174
00:56:08.970 --> 00:56:11.880
we had a secret show where all the people involved to talk about it.

2175
00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:15.630
I bet this is a lot of people not pretending to be involved because the cops

2176
00:56:15.631 --> 00:56:17.790
came to the store and they were looking for the people,

2177
00:56:17.791 --> 00:56:19.620
but nobody could figure out what happened.

2178
00:56:19.810 --> 00:56:21.240
I don't think they even looked on the roof.

2179
00:56:21.390 --> 00:56:22.230
Did they ever look on the roof?

2180
00:56:22.350 --> 00:56:23.183
No,

2181
00:56:23.450 --> 00:56:24.370
not really happened.

2182
00:56:24.670 --> 00:56:25.503
<v 5>Genius though.</v>

2183
00:56:25.640 --> 00:56:26.051
Oh it was.

2184
00:56:26.051 --> 00:56:27.340
It was ruthless.

2185
00:56:27.610 --> 00:56:29.110
But it was a standup Comedians,

2186
00:56:29.111 --> 00:56:29.411
you know,

2187
00:56:29.411 --> 00:56:30.340
drunk and high.

2188
00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:31.030
Go on.

2189
00:56:31.030 --> 00:56:31.560
Should we?

2190
00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:31.971
Yeah.

2191
00:56:31.971 --> 00:56:32.760
Fuck it.

2192
00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:33.730
That's awesome.

2193
00:56:33.820 --> 00:56:36.190
But we didn't know about it literally until it happened.

2194
00:56:36.191 --> 00:56:39.820
You know that front area of the common patterns are sensing cameras.

2195
00:56:40.570 --> 00:56:42.430
Like we used to throw crab apples at cars,

2196
00:56:42.431 --> 00:56:42.911
his kids,

2197
00:56:42.911 --> 00:56:43.660
that was our,

2198
00:56:43.660 --> 00:56:48.070
we would take these apples and you would just hit cars as hard as you could as

2199
00:56:48.071 --> 00:56:49.510
they're driving down the road.

2200
00:56:49.511 --> 00:56:51.460
Some east coast shit or snowballs.

2201
00:56:51.580 --> 00:56:54.460
Snowballs in the middle of winter with snow all over the road.

2202
00:56:54.490 --> 00:56:55.760
How about snowballs with rocks?

2203
00:56:55.761 --> 00:56:57.790
Inside of that was a big one.

2204
00:56:57.880 --> 00:56:59.350
A lot of kids did that.

2205
00:56:59.650 --> 00:57:04.650
You drive by and you hear your car go like you motherfucker hit the brakes and

2206
00:57:04.811 --> 00:57:06.760
then they scattered in three different directions.

2207
00:57:07.390 --> 00:57:09.670
We used to set up our escape routes.

2208
00:57:09.940 --> 00:57:13.090
Like we had this one behind these trees.

2209
00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:14.260
We'd be behind these trees,

2210
00:57:14.261 --> 00:57:17.870
we'd throw the crab apples and we kind of try to,

2211
00:57:17.950 --> 00:57:19.000
once they stopped,

2212
00:57:19.210 --> 00:57:20.620
we'd kind of show ourselves.

2213
00:57:20.740 --> 00:57:22.780
Cause we had such an amazing escape route.

2214
00:57:22.781 --> 00:57:24.100
We wanted them to come after.

2215
00:57:24.820 --> 00:57:28.880
We'd run through this guy's backyard and he had a creek through his backyard,

2216
00:57:28.900 --> 00:57:31.570
like I've kind of lived near the woods and he had a pipe,

2217
00:57:31.571 --> 00:57:33.850
the creek went and a pipe that went under the road.

2218
00:57:34.330 --> 00:57:37.450
So there was a fence around his yard and it was like,

2219
00:57:37.451 --> 00:57:37.960
uh,

2220
00:57:37.960 --> 00:57:38.950
if you open the fence,

2221
00:57:38.951 --> 00:57:39.790
it closed itself.

2222
00:57:39.791 --> 00:57:43.120
So we had a stick that would keep the fence open the door.

2223
00:57:43.450 --> 00:57:45.450
The last guy would kick the stick out to the gate,

2224
00:57:45.451 --> 00:57:46.960
would close if they were chasing you.

2225
00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:48.730
We'd run down into the creek,

2226
00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:52.000
through the pipe and come up on the other side of the road and just watch him

2227
00:57:52.001 --> 00:57:53.080
looking for us.

2228
00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:54.153
That's awesome.

2229
00:57:55.080 --> 00:57:56.380
And we lived for this.

2230
00:57:56.440 --> 00:58:00.010
What have you fell and cracked her ankle and that guy came there and just fucked

2231
00:58:00.011 --> 00:58:00.844
your face.

2232
00:58:02.140 --> 00:58:03.520
Knocked all your teeth out.

2233
00:58:03.700 --> 00:58:04.120
No,

2234
00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:04.331
no,

2235
00:58:04.331 --> 00:58:09.331
no fat Quaker oats box cock out of his pants and just fuck your faith and your

2236
00:58:10.001 --> 00:58:10.331
friends.

2237
00:58:10.331 --> 00:58:13.290
There are a bunch of pussies are not going to help you guys get a giant hard on.

2238
00:58:13.310 --> 00:58:16.060
It's just been waiting for some kid to throw a piece of fruit.

2239
00:58:16.061 --> 00:58:16.320
It is.

2240
00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:16.640
Cars.

2241
00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:18.860
We can find an excuse to punch his teeth out.

2242
00:58:18.890 --> 00:58:19.723
Fuck his face.

2243
00:58:20.170 --> 00:58:23.140
He's just got you pinned up against the opening of that tube.

2244
00:58:23.141 --> 00:58:24.220
That was cement tube.

2245
00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:25.270
I'm writing this as

2246
00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:28.393
you,

2247
00:58:28.500 --> 00:58:29.021
you know,

2248
00:58:29.021 --> 00:58:31.540
know whether you should rub his balls to make it go quicker.

2249
00:58:31.870 --> 00:58:33.010
This movie,

2250
00:58:33.011 --> 00:58:34.480
right finger his ass.

2251
00:58:34.481 --> 00:58:36.190
And maybe this will come or just,

2252
00:58:37.140 --> 00:58:37.360
no,

2253
00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:39.310
but I did have a cousin I fight it.

2254
00:58:39.340 --> 00:58:40.390
Would that make them come quicker?

2255
00:58:40.420 --> 00:58:41.800
I had a cousin who uh,

2256
00:58:41.980 --> 00:58:42.611
who said,

2257
00:58:42.611 --> 00:58:43.330
uh,

2258
00:58:43.330 --> 00:58:43.720
you know,

2259
00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:46.600
he was the older cousin Ted Ted Smith said to me,

2260
00:58:47.170 --> 00:58:48.130
if you get caught,

2261
00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:49.030
you're on your own.

2262
00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:49.900
That was the deal.

2263
00:58:49.900 --> 00:58:50.733
You're on your own.

2264
00:58:50.890 --> 00:58:51.760
Ted gets caught.

2265
00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:53.290
Who were you with Eddie gift?

2266
00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:58.440
I saw some kid beat the fuck out of some other guy who threw a snowball at his

2267
00:58:58.451 --> 00:58:59.020
car.

2268
00:58:59.020 --> 00:58:59.411
Really?

2269
00:58:59.411 --> 00:59:02.740
Some guys threw snowballs at this guy's car and hit the car.

2270
00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:03.160
Boom,

2271
00:59:03.160 --> 00:59:03.780
boom.

2272
00:59:03.780 --> 00:59:05.410
And you see the guy lock up,

2273
00:59:05.411 --> 00:59:06.050
hit the brakes,

2274
00:59:06.050 --> 00:59:07.450
she car shots,

2275
00:59:07.810 --> 00:59:08.411
click.

2276
00:59:08.411 --> 00:59:12.370
He throws it into park and he's just sprinting from the moment he gets out of

2277
00:59:12.371 --> 00:59:12.880
the car.

2278
00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:13.120
He,

2279
00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:13.571
he was,

2280
00:59:13.571 --> 00:59:14.560
there was no hesitation.

2281
00:59:14.561 --> 00:59:17.760
This guy had a fucking plan and the kid hesitated for a second.

2282
00:59:17.761 --> 00:59:18.400
It was like,

2283
00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:19.540
Oh shit.

2284
00:59:19.570 --> 00:59:21.590
Like it was the cod came out way too.

2285
00:59:22.370 --> 00:59:23.090
<v 7>He just didn't,</v>

2286
00:59:23.090 --> 00:59:23.361
you know,

2287
00:59:23.361 --> 00:59:23.691
you got a,

2288
00:59:23.691 --> 00:59:25.220
if a guy starts running at you,

2289
00:59:25.250 --> 00:59:26.300
you got to know when to run.

2290
00:59:26.301 --> 00:59:26.990
And this guy was,

2291
00:59:26.990 --> 00:59:27.950
he was a motherfucker.

2292
00:59:27.951 --> 00:59:29.090
He's a tough guy.

2293
00:59:29.091 --> 00:59:29.870
Obviously.

2294
00:59:29.870 --> 00:59:30.830
He was an athlete too.

2295
00:59:30.831 --> 00:59:31.760
He moved really quick,

2296
00:59:31.940 --> 00:59:36.260
took this guy down and just smashed his fucking face and people were screaming,

2297
00:59:36.261 --> 00:59:37.011
stop hitting him.

2298
00:59:37.011 --> 00:59:37.790
Stop hitting him.

2299
00:59:37.790 --> 00:59:39.290
He beat the fuck out of this guy.

2300
00:59:39.630 --> 00:59:40.920
<v 4>I don't like,</v>

2301
00:59:40.921 --> 00:59:44.010
I've never had it happen to me where I got hit by anything driving now,

2302
00:59:44.040 --> 00:59:45.230
I don't know if kids still do

2303
00:59:45.240 --> 00:59:45.540
<v 7>do it.</v>

2304
00:59:45.540 --> 00:59:45.961
Fuck yeah,

2305
00:59:45.961 --> 00:59:46.411
they do it.

2306
00:59:46.411 --> 00:59:47.244
He did crazy.

2307
00:59:47.340 --> 00:59:49.530
If you leave kids outside and there's snow,

2308
00:59:49.531 --> 00:59:50.730
they're thrown it at cars.

2309
00:59:50.910 --> 00:59:51.780
That's a fact.

2310
00:59:51.810 --> 00:59:53.070
There's no getting away from that.

2311
00:59:53.460 --> 00:59:56.370
But if you throw a rock inside a snowball and you hit someone's car,

2312
00:59:56.371 --> 00:59:57.750
you kind of deserve to get your ass.

2313
00:59:58.420 --> 00:59:59.520
You shouldn't get killed,

2314
00:59:59.730 --> 01:00:00.061
you know?

2315
01:00:00.061 --> 01:00:00.511
But I mean,

2316
01:00:00.511 --> 01:00:02.160
some of them maybe should scare the fuck.

2317
01:00:02.161 --> 01:00:03.210
I ain't smacking my face.

2318
01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:05.430
There's a lot of kids do that,

2319
01:00:05.431 --> 01:00:05.760
man.

2320
01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:07.230
A lot of you throwing crab apples,

2321
01:00:07.231 --> 01:00:09.570
you fuck their battles will dent the shit out of a car.

2322
01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:11.330
There was this crazy fucking group of kids.

2323
01:00:11.350 --> 01:00:12.580
<v 4>It's in our neighborhood that uh,</v>

2324
01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:13.750
used to uh,

2325
01:00:13.810 --> 01:00:15.640
fucked up crazy kids and uh,

2326
01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:21.000
they used to tie a dummy to like a rope up in a tree and swing it across the

2327
01:00:22.301 --> 01:00:23.134
road in front of,

2328
01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:24.450
<v 7>Oh my God.</v>

2329
01:00:24.451 --> 01:00:25.050
Yeah.

2330
01:00:25.050 --> 01:00:25.681
Oh my God.

2331
01:00:25.681 --> 01:00:26.610
That's when people die.

2332
01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:26.860
Yeah,

2333
01:00:26.860 --> 01:00:29.700
these guys were fucking crazy when I was in high school,

2334
01:00:29.701 --> 01:00:32.340
there was this one dude and he was,

2335
01:00:32.790 --> 01:00:36.360
I think he went to the rival high school and he was a little older.

2336
01:00:36.361 --> 01:00:37.950
So say if I was like 15,

2337
01:00:37.951 --> 01:00:40.230
he was like maybe 18 or 19 or something like that.

2338
01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:44.430
And his parents had a lot of money and a folks who grew up in Newton will know

2339
01:00:44.431 --> 01:00:45.264
this story.

2340
01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:45.960
Uh,

2341
01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:46.291
Newton,

2342
01:00:46.291 --> 01:00:47.850
Massachusetts in the 1980s,

2343
01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:49.590
I guess I was probably a freshman in high school,

2344
01:00:49.591 --> 01:00:50.820
so it was like 1981.

2345
01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:51.211
Well,

2346
01:00:51.211 --> 01:00:52.590
this guy had a trans-am,

2347
01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:55.540
like a fucking Burt Reynolds style chain with the Eagle on the,

2348
01:00:56.180 --> 01:00:57.720
on the hood and he ran over it,

2349
01:00:57.721 --> 01:00:58.554
dude.

2350
01:00:58.830 --> 01:01:03.830
And the guy got trapped under his car and he drove with the body under his car

2351
01:01:03.931 --> 01:01:05.670
for miles.

2352
01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:09.730
He just killed the guy by driving with this guy under his car.

2353
01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:11.660
Is he in prison still?

2354
01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:11.851
Oh,

2355
01:01:11.851 --> 01:01:12.600
I don't know.

2356
01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:13.230
I don't know.

2357
01:01:13.230 --> 01:01:14.580
I don't know if he's still in prison.

2358
01:01:14.581 --> 01:01:15.750
I know he went to jail.

2359
01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:16.081
I mean,

2360
01:01:16.081 --> 01:01:17.370
I know it was a big case.

2361
01:01:17.371 --> 01:01:18.300
It was all over the,

2362
01:01:18.301 --> 01:01:19.980
it was in the front page of the [inaudible]

2363
01:01:20.070 --> 01:01:20.670
<v 4>globe.</v>

2364
01:01:20.670 --> 01:01:21.240
Yep.

2365
01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:22.410
My big story,

2366
01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:25.050
my high school has been on sky.

2367
01:01:25.110 --> 01:01:27.870
My high school has been on the cover of USA Today,

2368
01:01:28.170 --> 01:01:29.550
like three times in my life.

2369
01:01:29.580 --> 01:01:30.413
One,

2370
01:01:30.450 --> 01:01:31.171
it was with,

2371
01:01:31.171 --> 01:01:31.380
uh,

2372
01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:35.280
our quarterback from our football team sprained his ankle at a pep rally and

2373
01:01:35.281 --> 01:01:38.370
they made a joke about it and like a little blurb that he at the pep rally,

2374
01:01:38.371 --> 01:01:38.701
he couldn't,

2375
01:01:38.701 --> 01:01:39.990
that's not as good as my story.

2376
01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:40.800
No,

2377
01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:41.760
but listen to this one.

2378
01:01:41.850 --> 01:01:42.420
Okay.

2379
01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:45.520
There was a guy to two guys and I,

2380
01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:46.433
I'm really,

2381
01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:48.300
um,

2382
01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:49.860
I'm pulling out of the one right now.

2383
01:01:49.861 --> 01:01:50.581
I'll tell the one,

2384
01:01:50.581 --> 01:01:51.031
the other one,

2385
01:01:51.031 --> 01:01:54.090
I will tell you off air and I'll tell you why because her mother Fucker,

2386
01:01:54.091 --> 01:01:54.551
I know,

2387
01:01:54.551 --> 01:01:54.971
I know,

2388
01:01:54.971 --> 01:01:55.251
I know,

2389
01:01:55.251 --> 01:01:55.581
I know.

2390
01:01:55.581 --> 01:01:55.831
I know.

2391
01:01:55.831 --> 01:01:56.664
Tell stories.

2392
01:01:56.730 --> 01:01:59.460
I kind of told it on my pockets a little bit and had to pull out of it and edit

2393
01:01:59.461 --> 01:02:00.720
it because he will,

2394
01:02:00.721 --> 01:02:01.950
he'll find us all.

2395
01:02:01.950 --> 01:02:03.540
And he's an evil genius.

2396
01:02:03.570 --> 01:02:04.350
The one dude,

2397
01:02:04.350 --> 01:02:04.980
but I don't mind.

2398
01:02:04.980 --> 01:02:05.970
But the other dude,

2399
01:02:06.150 --> 01:02:10.440
his name was Bob Corby and Bob Corby was the guy,

2400
01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:14.310
he was like a seventh year senior in high school and when he would come to

2401
01:02:14.311 --> 01:02:17.250
school you would hear about it.

2402
01:02:17.251 --> 01:02:18.600
Everyone's like Corby's here.

2403
01:02:18.690 --> 01:02:20.730
He was biggest badass back then.

2404
01:02:20.731 --> 01:02:20.941
You know,

2405
01:02:20.941 --> 01:02:22.360
this is my seventh year senior mean.

2406
01:02:22.390 --> 01:02:23.240
He never graduated,

2407
01:02:23.250 --> 01:02:24.480
never graduated because he,

2408
01:02:24.750 --> 01:02:25.550
he'd come to school,

2409
01:02:25.550 --> 01:02:27.780
kids coming to school once a month.

2410
01:02:28.310 --> 01:02:30.930
But he was the toughest motherfucker ever.

2411
01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:34.980
And one time I saw him come down the hall and there was like these gang kids

2412
01:02:34.981 --> 01:02:35.820
that were the tough kids.

2413
01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:40.080
And he came down and I was just cutting class and he grabbed one of them and was

2414
01:02:40.090 --> 01:02:42.450
just banging his head in the locker at the time.

2415
01:02:42.540 --> 01:02:46.710
He was probably like 19 or something in high school,

2416
01:02:46.860 --> 01:02:47.350
douchebag.

2417
01:02:47.350 --> 01:02:47.790
But,

2418
01:02:47.790 --> 01:02:50.010
but the kid he was beating up was probably the same thing.

2419
01:02:50.011 --> 01:02:52.470
Like these are the degenerates that just never,

2420
01:02:52.710 --> 01:02:53.280
they never to,

2421
01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:55.140
so he's just abusing this kid.

2422
01:02:55.141 --> 01:02:56.130
I get so scared.

2423
01:02:56.370 --> 01:03:00.630
I walked straight into a classroom that's going on and the teacher is like,

2424
01:03:00.631 --> 01:03:01.464
what are you doing?

2425
01:03:01.470 --> 01:03:02.430
What are you doing in my classroom?

2426
01:03:02.431 --> 01:03:03.000
And I go,

2427
01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.020
Shit.

2428
01:03:04.770 --> 01:03:07.410
Cause I was so scared of what was going on in the hallway,

2429
01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:09.330
but I just went into a random classroom.

2430
01:03:09.510 --> 01:03:10.410
Well this dude,

2431
01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:11.573
cops used to,

2432
01:03:11.830 --> 01:03:13.080
it was a known thing,

2433
01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:13.830
uh,

2434
01:03:13.830 --> 01:03:15.750
that the cop said when you got to go pick up up core,

2435
01:03:15.751 --> 01:03:18.240
but you got to bring a lot of cops cause he's that bad ass.

2436
01:03:18.570 --> 01:03:18.990
Well,

2437
01:03:18.990 --> 01:03:19.920
a couple of years ago,

2438
01:03:20.220 --> 01:03:22.260
I see on the front page of the newspaper,

2439
01:03:22.261 --> 01:03:23.094
I'm sitting on a plane,

2440
01:03:23.550 --> 01:03:23.910
uh,

2441
01:03:23.910 --> 01:03:28.910
FBI agents come to his house because he's dealing drugs and his wife blows away

2442
01:03:29.161 --> 01:03:30.690
an FBI agent with a shotgun.

2443
01:03:31.580 --> 01:03:32.010
And,

2444
01:03:32.010 --> 01:03:32.310
uh,

2445
01:03:32.310 --> 01:03:34.860
what happened was cops came in,

2446
01:03:34.861 --> 01:03:35.820
he took the drugs,

2447
01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:37.350
flushed them down the toilet,

2448
01:03:37.351 --> 01:03:38.340
ran out the back door.

2449
01:03:39.090 --> 01:03:42.870
FBI agent says to his wife were coming upstairs.

2450
01:03:43.380 --> 01:03:44.213
She goes,

2451
01:03:44.250 --> 01:03:45.150
don't come up here.

2452
01:03:45.330 --> 01:03:46.320
She's got her baby.

2453
01:03:46.530 --> 01:03:47.311
She's got a shotgun.

2454
01:03:47.311 --> 01:03:47.581
She goes,

2455
01:03:47.581 --> 01:03:48.450
don't come up here.

2456
01:03:48.690 --> 01:03:49.261
And the FBI,

2457
01:03:49.261 --> 01:03:50.250
as you guys were coming up,

2458
01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:51.113
FBI,

2459
01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:56.080
and he comes around the corner and she just goes and kills now.

2460
01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:56.970
Uh,

2461
01:03:56.970 --> 01:03:58.710
the argument was going to be like,

2462
01:03:58.711 --> 01:03:59.011
she,

2463
01:03:59.011 --> 01:04:00.180
she ended up getting prison.

2464
01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:02.100
The Bob Corby didn't.

2465
01:04:02.130 --> 01:04:04.590
So I'm probably dead when I go back to Pittsburgh for telling him this.

2466
01:04:04.591 --> 01:04:05.424
But uh,

2467
01:04:05.550 --> 01:04:06.450
but she,

2468
01:04:06.451 --> 01:04:08.730
the argument was when drug dealers raid,

2469
01:04:08.731 --> 01:04:09.120
like,

2470
01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:10.570
why are you telling the story if you're

2471
01:04:12.870 --> 01:04:13.960
new tone on this mommy,

2472
01:04:14.020 --> 01:04:14.480
it was,

2473
01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:15.840
it was all over the newspaper.

2474
01:04:15.841 --> 01:04:16.111
I mean,

2475
01:04:16.111 --> 01:04:16.371
it's a,

2476
01:04:16.371 --> 01:04:17.204
it's a known,

2477
01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:17.941
so are still,

2478
01:04:17.941 --> 01:04:19.480
you're still saying you shouldn't be telling him no,

2479
01:04:19.481 --> 01:04:19.621
no,

2480
01:04:19.621 --> 01:04:20.160
I'm joking.

2481
01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:20.371
But,

2482
01:04:20.371 --> 01:04:21.000
uh,

2483
01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:21.833
but uh,

2484
01:04:22.210 --> 01:04:23.740
so she's shotgun the shotgun,

2485
01:04:23.741 --> 01:04:24.990
the cop that the argument is,

2486
01:04:24.991 --> 01:04:26.460
and if you know from Craig Glacier,

2487
01:04:26.461 --> 01:04:27.780
from Sanford and sons,

2488
01:04:27.781 --> 01:04:29.730
when he used to raid drug dealers,

2489
01:04:29.731 --> 01:04:30.900
that was how he made his money.

2490
01:04:30.901 --> 01:04:33.580
He would tell drug dealers that he was a cop and then take all that money.

2491
01:04:33.590 --> 01:04:34.201
That is true.

2492
01:04:34.201 --> 01:04:35.730
You never know if it's really the FBI.

2493
01:04:35.830 --> 01:04:38.850
So that was her defense is that these could have been drug dealers coming to

2494
01:04:38.851 --> 01:04:39.580
steal money.

2495
01:04:39.580 --> 01:04:40.770
She's protecting her child.

2496
01:04:41.010 --> 01:04:41.843
Yep.

2497
01:04:42.210 --> 01:04:43.860
She's right in a lot of ways,

2498
01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:44.850
you know?

2499
01:04:44.850 --> 01:04:45.300
Yeah.

2500
01:04:45.300 --> 01:04:47.100
But why would they looking for him?

2501
01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:48.900
Because he was selling drugs.

2502
01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:50.640
So she must have probably known that.

2503
01:04:50.670 --> 01:04:51.170
Right?

2504
01:04:51.170 --> 01:04:51.530
I mean,

2505
01:04:51.530 --> 01:04:52.710
they should probably,

2506
01:04:52.711 --> 01:04:53.160
yeah,

2507
01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:54.050
she probably thought someone,

2508
01:04:54.290 --> 01:04:55.290
he had a lot of priors.

2509
01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:57.150
That is a good excuse though,

2510
01:04:57.151 --> 01:05:00.150
that you could have thought of another drug dealer was stealing your money and

2511
01:05:00.180 --> 01:05:00.451
you know,

2512
01:05:00.451 --> 01:05:04.260
kind of calm and you have a woman with a child is a very fucking primal thing.

2513
01:05:04.450 --> 01:05:04.731
You know,

2514
01:05:04.731 --> 01:05:07.500
they'll defend their territory if they have a gun and some guy who may or may

2515
01:05:07.501 --> 01:05:09.450
not be an FBI agent coming up the stairs.

2516
01:05:09.750 --> 01:05:10.950
And how long did she go to jail for that?

2517
01:05:10.951 --> 01:05:11.191
I don't know.

2518
01:05:11.191 --> 01:05:12.050
I think she still says,

2519
01:05:12.060 --> 01:05:12.960
I think she's still in,

2520
01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:15.150
well this guy who um,

2521
01:05:15.570 --> 01:05:17.000
was the rival guy and uh,

2522
01:05:17.070 --> 01:05:18.000
you know from the rival

2523
01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.780
<v 6>high school was like the cool guy because his parents were like really wealthy</v>

2524
01:05:21.990 --> 01:05:23.670
so he had a car that was like,

2525
01:05:23.671 --> 01:05:27.630
we were all envious of like if we had a nice car back then it was an old shitty

2526
01:05:27.631 --> 01:05:28.320
car.

2527
01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:30.120
He had like a nice new car.

2528
01:05:30.121 --> 01:05:34.690
It was mind boggling to us this time of the 1980 trans am or what do you drove

2529
01:05:34.860 --> 01:05:35.671
over somebody?

2530
01:05:35.671 --> 01:05:37.080
He dragged this guy for,

2531
01:05:37.081 --> 01:05:42.081
I think it was something like seven miles and there was a meaty streak for seven

2532
01:05:42.211 --> 01:05:43.011
miles I need,

2533
01:05:43.011 --> 01:05:44.190
the guy was stuck under his,

2534
01:05:44.370 --> 01:05:44.611
you know,

2535
01:05:44.611 --> 01:05:46.040
it's a car and he,

2536
01:05:46.090 --> 01:05:49.830
it's a low car cause it's the Trans am and the guy got stuck under it and

2537
01:05:49.831 --> 01:05:52.560
dragged for like seven miles.

2538
01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:54.440
<v 4>I dragged a hooker once for about,</v>

2539
01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:55.333
uh,

2540
01:05:55.450 --> 01:05:58.130
I'd take like five feet a car in a car.

2541
01:05:58.730 --> 01:05:59.930
She was she hanging on or what?

2542
01:05:59.931 --> 01:06:03.200
He tried to put her arm in my window to unlock my door.

2543
01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:04.760
Like I put down the window a little bit.

2544
01:06:04.761 --> 01:06:05.720
It was like a crack whore.

2545
01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:06.913
And uh,

2546
01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:09.230
I was coming home from a Gig and uh,

2547
01:06:09.290 --> 01:06:12.440
I will admit I had had a little bit to drink and uh,

2548
01:06:12.460 --> 01:06:13.910
I was eating when talking shit,

2549
01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:15.680
I had a bag of Wendy's on my,

2550
01:06:15.681 --> 01:06:15.950
uh,

2551
01:06:15.950 --> 01:06:16.101
no,

2552
01:06:16.101 --> 01:06:16.934
it wasn't an,

2553
01:06:17.300 --> 01:06:18.800
I have a bag of Wendy's on my lap.

2554
01:06:18.801 --> 01:06:22.220
I'm eating and it's like three in the morning and uh,

2555
01:06:22.910 --> 01:06:23.450
this,

2556
01:06:23.450 --> 01:06:28.450
the hooker flags me down and I thought like it was an emergency type thing,

2557
01:06:28.641 --> 01:06:29.930
the way she was like wavy.

2558
01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:30.621
So I said,

2559
01:06:30.621 --> 01:06:31.221
what's going on?

2560
01:06:31.221 --> 01:06:31.731
And she goes,

2561
01:06:31.731 --> 01:06:32.540
um,

2562
01:06:32.540 --> 01:06:33.470
it's so cold,

2563
01:06:33.471 --> 01:06:34.280
it's so cold.

2564
01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:35.930
And I went well and I only put the window down,

2565
01:06:35.931 --> 01:06:38.780
just a crack to find out what was going on cause it's so cold,

2566
01:06:38.781 --> 01:06:39.381
it's so cold.

2567
01:06:39.381 --> 01:06:40.130
And I go,

2568
01:06:40.130 --> 01:06:40.550
Huh.

2569
01:06:40.550 --> 01:06:40.971
And I'm like,

2570
01:06:40.971 --> 01:06:41.450
all right,

2571
01:06:41.450 --> 01:06:42.283
this is weird.

2572
01:06:42.290 --> 01:06:43.123
She goes,

2573
01:06:43.340 --> 01:06:44.061
let me get in your car,

2574
01:06:44.061 --> 01:06:44.601
let me in your car.

2575
01:06:44.601 --> 01:06:46.220
And I'm like not letting this chicken my car.

2576
01:06:46.221 --> 01:06:46.880
And she goes,

2577
01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:47.181
come on,

2578
01:06:47.181 --> 01:06:48.120
I'll give you a blowjob.

2579
01:06:48.740 --> 01:06:49.371
And I was like,

2580
01:06:49.371 --> 01:06:49.850
Huh.

2581
01:06:49.850 --> 01:06:50.683
And she goes,

2582
01:06:50.690 --> 01:06:51.740
I'll do it cheap.

2583
01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:53.330
And then it like all occurs to me,

2584
01:06:53.331 --> 01:06:53.630
I'm like,

2585
01:06:53.630 --> 01:06:53.961
oh,

2586
01:06:53.961 --> 01:06:54.794
hooker.

2587
01:06:54.950 --> 01:06:57.650
And by the time I'm about to like put up the window and go,

2588
01:06:57.920 --> 01:07:00.800
she's putting her arm in trying to unlock the door.

2589
01:07:01.250 --> 01:07:05.420
And so I just hit the gas to like get away from her and this is all that split

2590
01:07:05.421 --> 01:07:06.050
second.

2591
01:07:06.050 --> 01:07:07.130
So my reaction is,

2592
01:07:07.220 --> 01:07:08.570
fuck this chick's getting him like,

2593
01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:09.140
ah.

2594
01:07:09.140 --> 01:07:14.140
And I drive and I just see her just get dragged and then thump.

2595
01:07:15.380 --> 01:07:16.130
And then,

2596
01:07:16.130 --> 01:07:16.941
oh my head,

2597
01:07:16.941 --> 01:07:17.960
I thought I was that dude.

2598
01:07:17.990 --> 01:07:19.340
I thought I drove over her.

2599
01:07:19.370 --> 01:07:20.940
I'm a God.

2600
01:07:21.290 --> 01:07:26.130
And there I am in the middle of the ghetto in Pittsburgh and you know,

2601
01:07:26.150 --> 01:07:27.350
taking a shortcut through,

2602
01:07:27.740 --> 01:07:29.000
no one's going to believe me,

2603
01:07:29.180 --> 01:07:29.930
they're all going to be like,

2604
01:07:29.930 --> 01:07:30.081
oh,

2605
01:07:30.081 --> 01:07:31.310
he just likes to kill hookers.

2606
01:07:31.311 --> 01:07:32.091
You know the question,

2607
01:07:32.091 --> 01:07:33.290
did you finish your sandwich?

2608
01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:34.313
Yeah.

2609
01:07:34.340 --> 01:07:38.390
You know what I think I did because what happened was I just see a stand.

2610
01:07:38.460 --> 01:07:38.841
I don't know.

2611
01:07:38.841 --> 01:07:39.680
I stopped,

2612
01:07:39.830 --> 01:07:41.060
I look in the rear view mirror,

2613
01:07:41.150 --> 01:07:43.560
she's fucking on the ground and I'm like fucking cold.

2614
01:07:43.930 --> 01:07:45.620
And I had to make this decision where I'm like,

2615
01:07:45.621 --> 01:07:46.880
do I fucking leave or not?

2616
01:07:46.881 --> 01:07:48.840
And I think we talked about this on the ice house.

2617
01:07:49.370 --> 01:07:50.203
I fucking,

2618
01:07:50.350 --> 01:07:51.110
I was like,

2619
01:07:51.110 --> 01:07:52.220
I drove,

2620
01:07:52.250 --> 01:07:52.880
I,

2621
01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:57.880
I sat there and she stood up and finally and dusted herself off and gave me the

2622
01:07:57.891 --> 01:08:00.590
finger and then I gave her the finger and I drove away.

2623
01:08:00.740 --> 01:08:02.600
You gave her the finger up to you almost killed her.

2624
01:08:02.750 --> 01:08:04.310
You happy that she was alive.

2625
01:08:04.311 --> 01:08:05.570
So I was like,

2626
01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:06.500
that's the end of my life.

2627
01:08:06.501 --> 01:08:07.334
What is your compassion?

2628
01:08:07.350 --> 01:08:08.020
No,

2629
01:08:08.020 --> 01:08:08.853
laughing.

2630
01:08:10.130 --> 01:08:11.170
You've got on with life,

2631
01:08:11.180 --> 01:08:11.870
man.

2632
01:08:11.870 --> 01:08:12.830
You could have been a murderer.

2633
01:08:12.831 --> 01:08:13.340
You weren't,

2634
01:08:13.340 --> 01:08:14.031
you should've been like,

2635
01:08:14.031 --> 01:08:14.510
ma,

2636
01:08:14.510 --> 01:08:15.200
that wouldn't have,

2637
01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:16.033
I mean

2638
01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:17.690
<v 5>I would have gone to jail for murder,</v>

2639
01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:19.100
but I don't know about that.

2640
01:08:19.130 --> 01:08:19.640
But I did.

2641
01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:20.710
I do not think you would have.

2642
01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:21.550
Yeah.

2643
01:08:21.550 --> 01:08:23.510
It kind of attacked you in some way.

2644
01:08:23.540 --> 01:08:24.710
No one's gonna believe that.

2645
01:08:24.740 --> 01:08:25.131
Oh,

2646
01:08:25.131 --> 01:08:28.100
they would believe you if you told the story exactly the way you did it.

2647
01:08:28.101 --> 01:08:28.461
You know,

2648
01:08:28.461 --> 01:08:30.560
you had a Wendy's bag and you're a jack in the box,

2649
01:08:30.570 --> 01:08:31.403
whatever the fuck it was.

2650
01:08:32.390 --> 01:08:33.230
Wendy's in your lap.

2651
01:08:33.260 --> 01:08:33.700
I mean,

2652
01:08:33.700 --> 01:08:35.390
it all makes sense.

2653
01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:36.633
Yeah.

2654
01:08:36.660 --> 01:08:40.720
He didn't know this is the spot where hookers are we from that town yet

2655
01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:43.533
you don't have,

2656
01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:46.430
I drove through that area and it was a shortcut,

2657
01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:47.713
but uh,

2658
01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:48.441
most people would be like,

2659
01:08:48.441 --> 01:08:49.400
where are you coming from?

2660
01:08:49.401 --> 01:08:49.971
Where are you going?

2661
01:08:49.971 --> 01:08:50.781
It wouldn't have been like,

2662
01:08:50.781 --> 01:08:51.950
why would you go that way?

2663
01:08:51.980 --> 01:08:56.440
There was a lot of car shit that went down when I was a kid that I remember that

2664
01:08:56.450 --> 01:08:57.890
was a real lesson.

2665
01:08:57.890 --> 01:08:58.311
Like a,

2666
01:08:58.311 --> 01:09:01.940
there was a kid that I knew that from my town that killed his best friend in a

2667
01:09:01.941 --> 01:09:03.020
drunk driving accident.

2668
01:09:03.021 --> 01:09:04.580
By the time we were like seniors,

2669
01:09:04.940 --> 01:09:08.090
he drove drunk and smashed into a tree and kill his friend.

2670
01:09:08.510 --> 01:09:09.343
And uh,

2671
01:09:09.710 --> 01:09:11.730
there was that guy who drove over the guy.

2672
01:09:11.770 --> 01:09:12.170
There was like,

2673
01:09:12.170 --> 01:09:16.040
there was quite a few of those little situations where someone died young.

2674
01:09:16.041 --> 01:09:16.490
That's it.

2675
01:09:16.490 --> 01:09:17.360
It's cars.

2676
01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:18.530
It's drugs.

2677
01:09:18.830 --> 01:09:18.951
Oh,

2678
01:09:18.951 --> 01:09:22.670
that was another one of God that we went to high school with was changing his

2679
01:09:22.671 --> 01:09:23.504
tire,

2680
01:09:23.630 --> 01:09:26.570
changes his tire on the side of the road and someone smashed in his car and

2681
01:09:26.571 --> 01:09:27.404
killed him.

2682
01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:29.150
Some he just wasn't paying attention.

2683
01:09:29.151 --> 01:09:29.900
So there's like,

2684
01:09:29.900 --> 01:09:33.800
those were like three giant lessons that I was very fortunate that I didn't have

2685
01:09:33.801 --> 01:09:34.970
to get on my own.

2686
01:09:34.971 --> 01:09:36.050
Like don't drive drunk,

2687
01:09:36.290 --> 01:09:36.800
don't,

2688
01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:37.940
don't stand on the side of the road,

2689
01:09:37.941 --> 01:09:38.840
changing a tire,

2690
01:09:39.110 --> 01:09:39.500
you know,

2691
01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:40.700
and you know,

2692
01:09:40.701 --> 01:09:41.600
you gotta be careful.

2693
01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:41.841
I'm not,

2694
01:09:41.841 --> 01:09:42.531
I'm not proud of it.

2695
01:09:42.531 --> 01:09:45.620
But I used to drive drunk a lot as a kid and I was bad.

2696
01:09:45.621 --> 01:09:46.880
I was really bad and I don't,

2697
01:09:46.881 --> 01:09:48.230
I don't ever do it now.

2698
01:09:48.290 --> 01:09:49.430
I never fucking do it.

2699
01:09:49.431 --> 01:09:49.581
Like,

2700
01:09:49.581 --> 01:09:51.110
cause I'm too afraid it's,

2701
01:09:51.250 --> 01:09:52.460
it's avoidable.

2702
01:09:52.510 --> 01:09:53.343
Yeah.

2703
01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:54.740
But it's really kind of crazy.

2704
01:09:54.741 --> 01:09:56.050
If you stop and think about the fashion,

2705
01:09:56.070 --> 01:10:00.650
they're saying drug stores and they have liquor and then there's bars and they

2706
01:10:00.651 --> 01:10:02.720
have liquor and then the supermarkets and they have liquor.

2707
01:10:02.930 --> 01:10:06.080
If marijuana was as readily available as alcohol,

2708
01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:11.200
you'll be fucking bananas because literally if you go down like Ventura

2709
01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:12.410
Boulevard in studio city,

2710
01:10:12.770 --> 01:10:14.090
every 20 feet,

2711
01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:15.320
you can buy alcohol.

2712
01:10:15.470 --> 01:10:19.700
There's like a series of bars and restaurants every 20 feet you can get fucked

2713
01:10:19.701 --> 01:10:20.000
up.

2714
01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.070
I'm amazed that I'm still alive.

2715
01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:22.580
Uh,

2716
01:10:22.580 --> 01:10:26.090
one time I was at a bachelor party and we left and we had to get,

2717
01:10:26.091 --> 01:10:30.320
we were on Lake George in New York and we had to get back to the house where we

2718
01:10:30.321 --> 01:10:33.920
were all staying and there was like one bar in this town and all these guys

2719
01:10:33.921 --> 01:10:37.610
piled in this minivan and we were supposed to have to like vans for all the

2720
01:10:37.611 --> 01:10:38.000
guys.

2721
01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:41.660
But one of the vans had to leave to take a guy to the hospital from the bar.

2722
01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:42.913
And uh,

2723
01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:47.780
we were leaving and this Australian buddy of mine that was there jumps on the

2724
01:10:47.781 --> 01:10:48.501
roof of the car.

2725
01:10:48.501 --> 01:10:49.370
And I think it's funny,

2726
01:10:49.371 --> 01:10:51.560
I jump on the roof of the car too while you're driving.

2727
01:10:51.561 --> 01:10:51.670
No,

2728
01:10:51.670 --> 01:10:52.440
this is in the,

2729
01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:53.330
in the parking lot.

2730
01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:57.710
And then there's like a whole bunch of guys in the van and cause it was really

2731
01:10:57.711 --> 01:10:58.610
crowded so he goes,

2732
01:10:58.611 --> 01:10:58.751
ah,

2733
01:10:58.751 --> 01:10:59.720
I'm getting on the roof.

2734
01:10:59.721 --> 01:11:00.081
And I went,

2735
01:11:00.081 --> 01:11:00.231
hey,

2736
01:11:00.231 --> 01:11:01.670
I need to just fucking around.

2737
01:11:02.030 --> 01:11:03.020
And the guy driving,

2738
01:11:03.170 --> 01:11:03.861
good friend of mine,

2739
01:11:03.861 --> 01:11:08.810
sterling fucking took off and were on the roof holding on to like the rain

2740
01:11:08.811 --> 01:11:11.270
gutters and he drives.

2741
01:11:11.271 --> 01:11:12.890
It was seven miles back,

2742
01:11:13.010 --> 01:11:18.010
nothing driving fucking fast and I'm trying to punch like the window with my

2743
01:11:20.071 --> 01:11:20.431
hand,

2744
01:11:20.431 --> 01:11:23.220
like open slap it going to slow the fuck,

2745
01:11:23.250 --> 01:11:24.240
like you're going to kill us.

2746
01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:25.450
Like in my head I went,

2747
01:11:25.860 --> 01:11:30.720
I'm dying because every turn we went around I had to like redistribute my weight

2748
01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:35.070
on the roof of the car or I was flying off and and in my head up gone,

2749
01:11:35.071 --> 01:11:35.610
this is it.

2750
01:11:35.610 --> 01:11:37.860
This is how I die for sure I'm dying.

2751
01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:37.980
No,

2752
01:11:37.980 --> 01:11:38.990
you were saying stop.

2753
01:11:39.010 --> 01:11:40.680
You're saying stop dreaming.

2754
01:11:40.700 --> 01:11:41.910
Stop what happened to him.

2755
01:11:41.940 --> 01:11:44.430
There's a van full of guys all screaming faster,

2756
01:11:45.810 --> 01:11:46.560
like thinking,

2757
01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:49.440
you know everybody's shit face to thought it was funny and thought it was

2758
01:11:49.441 --> 01:11:50.274
hysterical.

2759
01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:50.790
And then we,

2760
01:11:50.790 --> 01:11:51.623
when we stopped,

2761
01:11:51.810 --> 01:11:53.010
when we stopped at the house,

2762
01:11:53.190 --> 01:11:54.060
I was really angry.

2763
01:11:54.061 --> 01:11:55.890
Like he did like a doughnut in the parking lot.

2764
01:11:55.891 --> 01:11:57.000
We finally fell off and,

2765
01:11:57.330 --> 01:11:57.930
uh,

2766
01:11:57.930 --> 01:11:58.763
the,

2767
01:11:58.950 --> 01:12:00.930
my one friend of all my friends,

2768
01:12:00.931 --> 01:12:02.040
only one friend said to me,

2769
01:12:02.041 --> 01:12:02.610
he's like,

2770
01:12:02.610 --> 01:12:02.821
he's like,

2771
01:12:02.821 --> 01:12:04.440
I was practically crying in there.

2772
01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:04.831
He's like,

2773
01:12:04.831 --> 01:12:07.290
I thought you were killing two people.

2774
01:12:07.380 --> 01:12:08.270
It could have hands.

2775
01:12:08.271 --> 01:12:08.580
Like,

2776
01:12:08.580 --> 01:12:09.360
he's like everyone,

2777
01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:11.730
but I look at the Australian guy next to me and I go,

2778
01:12:11.731 --> 01:12:12.960
we're going to fucking die.

2779
01:12:13.110 --> 01:12:13.661
I think it's my,

2780
01:12:13.661 --> 01:12:14.940
we need a cocktail up here.

2781
01:12:14.970 --> 01:12:15.181
Like,

2782
01:12:15.181 --> 01:12:18.300
he was just loving it and I'm like,

2783
01:12:18.540 --> 01:12:20.400
we're going to fucking die for sure.

2784
01:12:20.420 --> 01:12:25.350
If you fall off a car going any amount of miles an hour or 20 miles an hour,

2785
01:12:25.710 --> 01:12:27.740
probably going to 55 says Jesus,

2786
01:12:27.950 --> 01:12:28.830
they were dead as fuck.

2787
01:12:28.850 --> 01:12:29.310
Yeah.

2788
01:12:29.310 --> 01:12:31.250
I don't know how he did that.

2789
01:12:31.260 --> 01:12:31.680
Uh,

2790
01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:32.820
that football player,

2791
01:12:33.060 --> 01:12:34.680
the young was his name.

2792
01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:35.851
I forget something.

2793
01:12:35.851 --> 01:12:37.890
Henry died falling off.

2794
01:12:37.950 --> 01:12:38.783
What's it?

2795
01:12:38.820 --> 01:12:39.391
Chris Henry.

2796
01:12:39.391 --> 01:12:39.601
Yeah.

2797
01:12:39.601 --> 01:12:41.880
I fell off the back of a truck.

2798
01:12:42.090 --> 01:12:43.770
His wife was trying to get away from him.

2799
01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:44.271
Oh yeah.

2800
01:12:44.271 --> 01:12:45.840
You fell and cracked his head open.

2801
01:12:45.980 --> 01:12:49.620
I was embarrassed cause I kept thinking to myself this is how I'm going to die

2802
01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:54.030
and this is how my parents are going to have to like just such a whore like

2803
01:12:54.031 --> 01:12:54.190
yeah.

2804
01:12:54.190 --> 01:12:58.680
Are douchebags son was on the roof of a car and I was probably like 32 at the

2805
01:12:58.681 --> 01:12:59.514
time.

2806
01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:04.470
Like if I was 16 it'd be one thing.

2807
01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:05.311
Yeah.

2808
01:13:05.311 --> 01:13:06.360
I thought you were way younger.

2809
01:13:06.361 --> 01:13:08.010
I'm confused with the timeline.

2810
01:13:08.220 --> 01:13:09.390
Oh this is just a few years ago.

2811
01:13:09.780 --> 01:13:11.340
Oh Jesus Christ.

2812
01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:12.690
What the fuck man.

2813
01:13:12.691 --> 01:13:13.650
You hanging out with losers.

2814
01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:14.970
You don't like to

2815
01:13:14.970 --> 01:13:16.090
<v 1>ghost ride your whip Joe.</v>

2816
01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:20.073
<v 5>That's ridiculous.</v>

2817
01:13:20.150 --> 01:13:20.301
Yeah,

2818
01:13:20.301 --> 01:13:21.170
it was terrifying.

2819
01:13:21.410 --> 01:13:21.720
Yeah.

2820
01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:24.050
Gotta be real careful about what kind of drugs and hanging out with,

2821
01:13:24.051 --> 01:13:28.820
cause there's the drunks that try to top one up each other and try to out drunk.

2822
01:13:29.710 --> 01:13:33.730
<v 1>What is this guy's riding the whip that that stupid thing that those kids do</v>

2823
01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:37.510

2824
01:13:37.511 --> 01:13:39.340
cars like still driving down the street.

2825
01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:40.071
Oh come on.

2826
01:13:40.071 --> 01:13:40.960
And it's called ghost writing.

2827
01:13:40.961 --> 01:13:41.794
The width.

2828
01:13:41.830 --> 01:13:42.810
You've never seen this?

2829
01:13:42.820 --> 01:13:43.360
No.

2830
01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:44.050
Oh God.

2831
01:13:44.050 --> 01:13:47.590
People really the fuck is this the one where they fuck it up?

2832
01:13:47.610 --> 01:13:47.880
Yeah.

2833
01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:48.340
Yeah.

2834
01:13:48.340 --> 01:13:49.173
Oh my God.

2835
01:13:49.180 --> 01:13:49.720
Okay.

2836
01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:50.401
See this.

2837
01:13:50.401 --> 01:13:52.300
And a lot of times you get on top of the car,

2838
01:13:52.301 --> 01:13:54.010
sometimes you dancing next to the car.

2839
01:13:54.310 --> 01:13:54.750
I always go,

2840
01:13:54.750 --> 01:13:56.270
it's right from behind.

2841
01:13:56.860 --> 01:13:58.330
No way have you done it.

2842
01:13:58.420 --> 01:13:58.631
Yeah,

2843
01:13:58.631 --> 01:13:59.464
I've actually done it.

2844
01:14:00.070 --> 01:14:01.310
Oh see he falls.

2845
01:14:01.340 --> 01:14:03.080
So the other guy is screwed the Guy Cameron.

2846
01:14:03.730 --> 01:14:04.190
But yeah.

2847
01:14:04.190 --> 01:14:06.980
Runs right and it ran right into the camera.

2848
01:14:07.620 --> 01:14:08.440
<v 5>God.</v>

2849
01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:08.920
Yeah.

2850
01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:09.031
Yeah.

2851
01:14:09.031 --> 01:14:09.990
That's a good way to die,

2852
01:14:09.991 --> 01:14:10.510
right?

2853
01:14:10.510 --> 01:14:10.710
Yeah.

2854
01:14:10.710 --> 01:14:12.900
Cause you're filming of the most hilarious video ever.

2855
01:14:12.901 --> 01:14:16.630
And your fat friend falls off the fucking hood of the car as rolling towards you

2856
01:14:16.631 --> 01:14:17.620
with no brakes on.

2857
01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:19.490
I can't believe none out lonely.

2858
01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:23.140
One of the jackass guys has died and oh no.

2859
01:14:23.250 --> 01:14:24.280
Oh yeah.

2860
01:14:24.510 --> 01:14:25.750
It's not going on the highway.

2861
01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:27.820
Oh my God.

2862
01:14:27.821 --> 01:14:29.080
Look how fast he's going.

2863
01:14:29.620 --> 01:14:30.200
Or are they,

2864
01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:31.430
the guys were running towards it.

2865
01:14:32.950 --> 01:14:33.131
Yeah.

2866
01:14:33.131 --> 01:14:33.430
Cause it,

2867
01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:34.990
they're not going that fast.

2868
01:14:36.130 --> 01:14:37.330
So fucking stupid.

2869
01:14:37.660 --> 01:14:38.830
That's a good spot for it though.

2870
01:14:38.831 --> 01:14:40.150
If you're gonna do something fucking stupid.

2871
01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:45.850
There's an area out in Palmdale where we used to do all the fear factor stunts

2872
01:14:46.130 --> 01:14:49.930
because we would close off this giant stretch of road and we like set semis up

2873
01:14:49.931 --> 01:14:52.990
on it and people would be on the semis trying to jump from truck to truck and

2874
01:14:52.991 --> 01:14:53.824
shit like that.

2875
01:14:54.250 --> 01:14:55.150
But we would,

2876
01:14:55.210 --> 01:14:56.370
oh Jesus Christ.

2877
01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:56.531
Oh,

2878
01:14:56.531 --> 01:14:57.580
he's not going fast at all.

2879
01:14:57.581 --> 01:14:58.720
It just jumped right off of that thing.

2880
01:14:58.721 --> 01:14:59.554
That's ridiculous.

2881
01:14:59.750 --> 01:15:00.220
All right.

2882
01:15:00.220 --> 01:15:00.970
You can start with us.

2883
01:15:00.970 --> 01:15:03.040
You see anybody get really fucked up in fear factor?

2884
01:15:03.750 --> 01:15:04.060
Um,

2885
01:15:04.060 --> 01:15:04.450
no,

2886
01:15:04.450 --> 01:15:04.691
no,

2887
01:15:04.691 --> 01:15:05.524
not really.

2888
01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:05.831
I mean,

2889
01:15:05.831 --> 01:15:08.080
the worst accident I ever saw,

2890
01:15:08.081 --> 01:15:11.290
I was like a dude jumping from one boat to another and like smashed his face.

2891
01:15:11.750 --> 01:15:12.280
Wipe out.

2892
01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:12.670
Yeah.

2893
01:15:12.670 --> 01:15:13.780
I mean he hit it hard,

2894
01:15:13.781 --> 01:15:17.380
the boom and it looked bad when I left shoulder.

2895
01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:20.370
How did they not fuck themselves up?

2896
01:15:20.390 --> 01:15:21.223
Boy,

2897
01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:22.610
how do they not have a concussion?

2898
01:15:22.611 --> 01:15:25.650
But Jackass is way scarier than fear factors.

2899
01:15:25.651 --> 01:15:26.740
Some of the shit those guys did.

2900
01:15:26.741 --> 01:15:30.780
Like when Johnny Knoxville was a fucking already a movie star puts a blindfold

2901
01:15:30.781 --> 01:15:34.150
on and he stands in front of a bowl and the bowl sends him flying through the

2902
01:15:34.151 --> 01:15:35.530
air while he's blindfolded.

2903
01:15:35.770 --> 01:15:37.180
Those guys are crazy.

2904
01:15:37.210 --> 01:15:38.040
Well,

2905
01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:39.490
do you ever watch nitro circus?

2906
01:15:39.850 --> 01:15:40.210
No.

2907
01:15:40.210 --> 01:15:42.910
Nitro circus is jackass with talent.

2908
01:15:42.970 --> 01:15:43.990
I can't watch that shit.

2909
01:15:44.830 --> 01:15:46.750
I find it so impressive.

2910
01:15:46.751 --> 01:15:47.840
These guys are like trained.

2911
01:15:48.070 --> 01:15:48.760
They're like,

2912
01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:50.830
they took like the best motocross racer,

2913
01:15:50.831 --> 01:15:51.664
the best,

2914
01:15:51.850 --> 01:15:53.710
the best BMX or the best skateboarder,

2915
01:15:53.711 --> 01:15:54.370
the best.

2916
01:15:54.370 --> 01:15:54.821
Everybody.

2917
01:15:54.821 --> 01:15:55.750
That's the best of what they do.

2918
01:15:55.751 --> 01:15:57.880
And they do stunts and they'd beat the shit out of each other.

2919
01:15:58.420 --> 01:16:00.070
They do stunts and they like,

2920
01:16:00.071 --> 01:16:01.990
they'll jump out of an airplane without a parachute,

2921
01:16:02.620 --> 01:16:04.870
hook up to another guy with a parachute and,

2922
01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:07.000
but they do these things that I'm like,

2923
01:16:07.090 --> 01:16:09.010
how are they not dead?

2924
01:16:09.430 --> 01:16:10.091
That so they're,

2925
01:16:10.091 --> 01:16:11.590
they're more taking risks,

2926
01:16:11.591 --> 01:16:13.090
whereas the jackass guys are hurting.

2927
01:16:13.450 --> 01:16:14.221
They're hurting each other.

2928
01:16:14.221 --> 01:16:17.060
A different scene because you're talking about guys like jackass.

2929
01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:19.120
Guys put bulletproof vests on and then get shot.

2930
01:16:19.121 --> 01:16:20.320
But the risks they're taking,

2931
01:16:20.350 --> 01:16:21.640
the jackass guys produced.

2932
01:16:21.670 --> 01:16:23.290
Johnny Knoxville produces nitric circuits.

2933
01:16:23.980 --> 01:16:26.150
If you watch it and Johnny does stuff and he,

2934
01:16:26.230 --> 01:16:28.870
that's where he hurt himself when he fucked up his dick.

2935
01:16:29.420 --> 01:16:30.170
But yeah,

2936
01:16:30.170 --> 01:16:30.301
he,

2937
01:16:30.301 --> 01:16:31.300
he had like pee,

2938
01:16:31.301 --> 01:16:32.290
I don't know if he still does,

2939
01:16:32.291 --> 01:16:36.340
but I think he gets to like pee and a catheter or something because he went,

2940
01:16:36.341 --> 01:16:38.260
they taught him how to backflip a motorcycle.

2941
01:16:38.580 --> 01:16:39.940
Johnny just tried it.

2942
01:16:40.810 --> 01:16:42.140
They broke his dick.

2943
01:16:42.190 --> 01:16:43.510
A handlebar went straight.

2944
01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:45.581
Oh,

2945
01:16:45.581 --> 01:16:46.990
Jesus son.

2946
01:16:47.110 --> 01:16:47.890
Brutal.

2947
01:16:47.890 --> 01:16:49.150
Oh my goodness.

2948
01:16:49.180 --> 01:16:50.013
But um,

2949
01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:50.381
yeah,

2950
01:16:50.381 --> 01:16:53.380
they have this guy street like Tommy who is one of the,

2951
01:16:53.381 --> 01:16:53.950
uh,

2952
01:16:53.950 --> 01:16:56.590
one of the nitro circus guys and he's kind of their fat guy that they make fun

2953
01:16:56.591 --> 01:16:56.681
of.

2954
01:16:56.681 --> 01:16:58.300
I've tried to have him on the podcast and he's,

2955
01:16:58.660 --> 01:16:59.021
he's,

2956
01:16:59.021 --> 01:16:59.500
uh,

2957
01:16:59.500 --> 01:16:59.861
he's like,

2958
01:16:59.861 --> 01:17:00.011
yeah,

2959
01:17:00.011 --> 01:17:01.240
when I come to California I'll do it.

2960
01:17:01.241 --> 01:17:01.571
But he,

2961
01:17:01.571 --> 01:17:02.050
uh,

2962
01:17:02.050 --> 01:17:02.740
the other day he,

2963
01:17:02.740 --> 01:17:03.520
he,

2964
01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:04.600
he instagrammed a picture.

2965
01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:05.920
He just cut his finger off.

2966
01:17:06.340 --> 01:17:08.380
It's the grossest picture.

2967
01:17:09.710 --> 01:17:10.543
Um,

2968
01:17:10.550 --> 01:17:11.420
but he,

2969
01:17:12.020 --> 01:17:16.040
they make him do all these things and he's not talented like they are.

2970
01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:18.550
And so whenever there's like something fun there,

2971
01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:19.700
the slip and slide guys.

2972
01:17:19.701 --> 01:17:20.990
So have you ever seen their crazy?

2973
01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:22.371
Don't watch that shit.

2974
01:17:22.371 --> 01:17:25.100
I don't want to watch idiots doing stupid shit and they're going to get them

2975
01:17:25.101 --> 01:17:25.370
hurt.

2976
01:17:25.370 --> 01:17:27.500
It's phenomenal to you.

2977
01:17:28.220 --> 01:17:29.420
I don't like that stuff.

2978
01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:30.290
I get it,

2979
01:17:30.290 --> 01:17:30.651
you know,

2980
01:17:30.651 --> 01:17:31.461
but I don't like it.

2981
01:17:31.461 --> 01:17:31.791
I don't want,

2982
01:17:31.791 --> 01:17:34.430
I want to watch guys run into walls and break their face.

2983
01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:34.671
No,

2984
01:17:34.671 --> 01:17:34.790
no,

2985
01:17:34.790 --> 01:17:34.941
no.

2986
01:17:34.941 --> 01:17:35.690
But I mean,

2987
01:17:35.690 --> 01:17:37.100
when they're doing stuff like it,

2988
01:17:37.340 --> 01:17:38.870
there's other shit in this world that a gift.

2989
01:17:38.940 --> 01:17:41.240
It's that stents are phenomenal,

2990
01:17:41.450 --> 01:17:41.870
I'm sure.

2991
01:17:41.870 --> 01:17:42.703
Phenomenal.

2992
01:17:42.980 --> 01:17:43.460
I'm sure.

2993
01:17:43.460 --> 01:17:43.840
Yeah.

2994
01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:44.510
Good luck with that.

2995
01:17:44.510 --> 01:17:44.661
Well,

2996
01:17:44.661 --> 01:17:45.150
like Travis,

2997
01:17:45.150 --> 01:17:46.430
you know Travis does Toronto's,

2998
01:17:46.510 --> 01:17:46.960
no,

2999
01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:47.780
can I have the name?

3000
01:17:47.780 --> 01:17:48.970
Travis is the motocross racer

3001
01:17:50.510 --> 01:17:51.380
rally racing.

3002
01:17:51.530 --> 01:17:52.370
A few years back,

3003
01:17:53.090 --> 01:17:55.910
the guy's broken every bone in his body and he went to a,

3004
01:17:55.911 --> 01:17:56.290
um,

3005
01:17:56.290 --> 01:17:56.520
uh,

3006
01:17:56.520 --> 01:17:57.860
I think it was a thing for him.

3007
01:17:57.890 --> 01:17:58.510
A birthday.

3008
01:17:58.510 --> 01:17:58.650
No,

3009
01:17:58.650 --> 01:18:01.070
it was like a benefit slash birthday thing,

3010
01:18:01.071 --> 01:18:01.341
I think.

3011
01:18:01.341 --> 01:18:02.650
I think if I'm thinking about the right guy,

3012
01:18:02.660 --> 01:18:05.430
that's the thing with the Geraldo and arch barker were there.

3013
01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:06.313
No,

3014
01:18:06.510 --> 01:18:08.030
cause they roasted them for MTV.

3015
01:18:08.050 --> 01:18:08.230
No,

3016
01:18:08.230 --> 01:18:09.063
it wasn't that,

3017
01:18:09.210 --> 01:18:10.190
it might be a different guy,

3018
01:18:10.191 --> 01:18:10.700
but go ahead.

3019
01:18:10.700 --> 01:18:13.700
But he now racist rally racing because he's,

3020
01:18:14.270 --> 01:18:16.280
he's just fucked himself up so much.

3021
01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:18.110
So he has to drive cars now.

3022
01:18:18.150 --> 01:18:19.880
Cars broken everything too many times.

3023
01:18:20.990 --> 01:18:23.840
There's a great documentary on him called 99 lives,

3024
01:18:24.170 --> 01:18:25.310
I think it's called 99 lives.

3025
01:18:25.311 --> 01:18:26.144
And uh,

3026
01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:29.000
it talks about his lack of fear,

3027
01:18:29.190 --> 01:18:30.023
like his,

3028
01:18:30.070 --> 01:18:32.480
his mental capacity and how he doesn't,

3029
01:18:32.930 --> 01:18:33.111
like,

3030
01:18:33.111 --> 01:18:36.290
we all have fear and he doesn't have it.

3031
01:18:36.860 --> 01:18:37.371
And a,

3032
01:18:37.371 --> 01:18:39.020
it just doesn't have it.

3033
01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:40.100
He just doesn't have it.

3034
01:18:40.101 --> 01:18:40.250
Like,

3035
01:18:40.250 --> 01:18:41.000
is that real?

3036
01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:41.291
Yeah.

3037
01:18:41.291 --> 01:18:43.310
You think there's something scientific to it that,

3038
01:18:43.311 --> 01:18:44.144
uh,

3039
01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:46.250
like grain that's like got a missing piece?

3040
01:18:46.251 --> 01:18:46.820
Yep.

3041
01:18:46.820 --> 01:18:47.270
Ooh,

3042
01:18:47.270 --> 01:18:48.920
that sounds like a really dumb thing.

3043
01:18:49.100 --> 01:18:49.490
Yeah.

3044
01:18:49.490 --> 01:18:50.323
But he's a,

3045
01:18:50.620 --> 01:18:51.020
you know,

3046
01:18:51.020 --> 01:18:51.560
he's,

3047
01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:53.570
he's a accomplished a lot of,

3048
01:18:54.590 --> 01:18:57.650
apparently there's a video of Johnny Knoxville breaking his urethra.

3049
01:18:57.800 --> 01:18:58.910
If anybody want to watch that.

3050
01:18:58.911 --> 01:18:59.744
What it was,

3051
01:19:00.390 --> 01:19:02.930
Matt Hoffman's tribute to evil Knievel.

3052
01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:04.233
I don't want to see it though.

3053
01:19:05.340 --> 01:19:07.340
It's five minutes and breaking my own rules.

3054
01:19:07.341 --> 01:19:08.180
But even telling you,

3055
01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:10.220
Matt Hoffman is a guy that is,

3056
01:19:10.430 --> 01:19:15.430
he's a BMX or that he's hurt himself so many times that they wouldn't do surgery

3057
01:19:15.501 --> 01:19:15.921
on his knee,

3058
01:19:15.921 --> 01:19:16.820
this special surgery,

3059
01:19:16.821 --> 01:19:19.910
but they had it in Canada and they didn't have it in the United States.

3060
01:19:19.911 --> 01:19:21.020
So he went to Canada to do it.

3061
01:19:21.021 --> 01:19:22.520
The doctor could do it in Canada,

3062
01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:27.530
but by law he couldn't do it unless he was awake.

3063
01:19:27.890 --> 01:19:30.680
He couldn't put 'em under for it and uh,

3064
01:19:31.070 --> 01:19:33.110
they had to bring whatever the,

3065
01:19:33.111 --> 01:19:33.470
um,

3066
01:19:33.470 --> 01:19:35.450
it was like an anterior cruciate ligament or something.

3067
01:19:35.451 --> 01:19:36.284
And it was,

3068
01:19:36.380 --> 01:19:37.340
it was made of,

3069
01:19:37.370 --> 01:19:38.203
uh,

3070
01:19:38.750 --> 01:19:40.040
I forget what they use,

3071
01:19:40.070 --> 01:19:40.720
not titanic.

3072
01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:42.560
It was whatever they use to make it,

3073
01:19:43.100 --> 01:19:43.880
um,

3074
01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:48.080
something like a polypropylene or like a group of wire or whatever it was.

3075
01:19:48.830 --> 01:19:52.000
He had to ship it to Canada because it was like a legal,

3076
01:19:52.010 --> 01:19:53.180
they weren't allowed to use it there.

3077
01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:55.250
So he put it in like he owns a BMX company,

3078
01:19:55.251 --> 01:19:57.020
put it in like a bike box and senate,

3079
01:19:57.440 --> 01:19:59.810
and then the doctor did it and he talks about it.

3080
01:19:59.811 --> 01:20:04.470
He helped the doctor do the operation because there was like the doctorate,

3081
01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:05.840
like saw this park,

3082
01:20:06.010 --> 01:20:10.140
put it in and he stayed awake and let the doctor put this thing in and these

3083
01:20:10.141 --> 01:20:10.771
guys are just,

3084
01:20:10.771 --> 01:20:11.250
well my,

3085
01:20:11.250 --> 01:20:13.730
I had an ACL operation where I stayed away.

3086
01:20:13.730 --> 01:20:14.790
Can you stayed awake from them?

3087
01:20:14.850 --> 01:20:15.470
But I just want to,

3088
01:20:15.470 --> 01:20:17.100
I wanted to go see it was the first one.

3089
01:20:17.101 --> 01:20:18.480
So they just did an epidural?

3090
01:20:18.630 --> 01:20:19.260
Yeah,

3091
01:20:19.260 --> 01:20:21.390
they give you an epidural and knock knock you out.

3092
01:20:21.450 --> 01:20:24.190
So from the waist down I couldn't feel anything and you might go watch.

3093
01:20:24.290 --> 01:20:26.970
She wanted to watch one to see it and I was scared to go under too.

3094
01:20:27.180 --> 01:20:28.013
I don't like going under,

3095
01:20:28.410 --> 01:20:30.810
I don't want to go on under going under to me,

3096
01:20:30.860 --> 01:20:31.070
uh,

3097
01:20:31.070 --> 01:20:32.310
was like an knocked out.

3098
01:20:32.370 --> 01:20:32.580
Yeah,

3099
01:20:32.580 --> 01:20:33.270
like I didn't,

3100
01:20:33.270 --> 01:20:34.800
I didn't ever want that to happen.

3101
01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:35.940
I did it once for an,

3102
01:20:36.030 --> 01:20:37.210
I broke my ankle and they,

3103
01:20:37.250 --> 01:20:39.990
they put me under and then when they went to take the plate,

3104
01:20:40.180 --> 01:20:41.430
the screws out,

3105
01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:42.593
I said,

3106
01:20:42.690 --> 01:20:44.940
I'm not going fucking under I so you went with an epidural?

3107
01:20:45.250 --> 01:20:45.880
Yeah.

3108
01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:46.290
There.

3109
01:20:46.290 --> 01:20:48.000
There's certain things they won't do with an epidural,

3110
01:20:48.420 --> 01:20:49.230
but uh,

3111
01:20:49.230 --> 01:20:50.010
there's,

3112
01:20:50.010 --> 01:20:50.730
you know,

3113
01:20:50.730 --> 01:20:53.580
the second knee operation that got pen and put me under,

3114
01:20:55.110 --> 01:20:56.250
he had to help the doctor.

3115
01:20:56.250 --> 01:20:57.000
I wouldn't have been,

3116
01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.470
I was drugged up to the gills.

3117
01:20:58.500 --> 01:20:59.010
Yeah.

3118
01:20:59.010 --> 01:20:59.950
I don't think he was drunk.

3119
01:21:00.530 --> 01:21:01.050
Yeah.

3120
01:21:01.050 --> 01:21:02.430
How did he help the doctor like here,

3121
01:21:02.431 --> 01:21:03.264
hold this,

3122
01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:04.500
hit that with a hammer.

3123
01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:05.393
When I say go,

3124
01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:08.640
I think I saw the interview with him when he was talking about fucking robot

3125
01:21:08.641 --> 01:21:09.840
doctor Voodoo doctor.

3126
01:21:09.841 --> 01:21:10.620
Was he going to,

3127
01:21:10.620 --> 01:21:14.370
that dude who rented me the scooter this week had esophageal cancer,

3128
01:21:14.790 --> 01:21:16.560
had his whole esophagus removed and they,

3129
01:21:16.590 --> 01:21:21.590
they moved his esophagus around to the side and back because he had acid reflux

3130
01:21:21.751 --> 01:21:23.760
so bad and he got esophagal cancer.

3131
01:21:24.150 --> 01:21:26.700
They did a procedure on him that had never been done before.

3132
01:21:26.850 --> 01:21:31.850
They put them into a coma to do the procedure because when your,

3133
01:21:32.760 --> 01:21:33.593
when you're under,

3134
01:21:33.690 --> 01:21:34.650
you still swallow,

3135
01:21:34.770 --> 01:21:36.090
you still have a swallowing reflex,

3136
01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:36.953
it still happens.

3137
01:21:37.260 --> 01:21:39.090
But when you're in a coma you don't swallow.

3138
01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:40.110
Oh.

3139
01:21:40.110 --> 01:21:41.910
So they had to pull him into a coma and I go,

3140
01:21:41.911 --> 01:21:42.721
what was that like?

3141
01:21:42.721 --> 01:21:43.291
And he goes,

3142
01:21:43.291 --> 01:21:44.050
well,

3143
01:21:44.050 --> 01:21:44.310
he,

3144
01:21:44.310 --> 01:21:44.521
I go,

3145
01:21:44.521 --> 01:21:45.181
why did you come out?

3146
01:21:45.181 --> 01:21:46.410
He gives about two days later,

3147
01:21:46.710 --> 01:21:47.091
he gets better.

3148
01:21:47.091 --> 01:21:49.290
I couldn't say my ABC's for about a month.

3149
01:21:49.690 --> 01:21:50.100
Wow.

3150
01:21:50.100 --> 01:21:51.570
Whoa.

3151
01:21:51.660 --> 01:21:52.860
But it saved his life.

3152
01:21:53.070 --> 01:21:53.903
The guy's alive.

3153
01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:55.170
Wow.

3154
01:21:55.170 --> 01:21:56.760
Think about that shit when you smoked cigarettes,

3155
01:21:56.761 --> 01:21:57.594
Brian.

3156
01:21:58.860 --> 01:21:59.580
Yeah.

3157
01:21:59.580 --> 01:22:00.210
Brian thinks to,

3158
01:22:00.210 --> 01:22:01.330
it's never going to happen to him.

3159
01:22:01.820 --> 01:22:03.570
He's going to be that guy that's going to be fine.

3160
01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:05.940
Smoking a pack a day for the rest of his fucking life.

3161
01:22:06.150 --> 01:22:06.983
Uh,

3162
01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:07.570
wait,

3163
01:22:07.570 --> 01:22:12.570
but you have the of the fucking fake cigarette when I'm inside God.

3164
01:22:14.820 --> 01:22:16.500
And also because he loves Stephen Dorff.

3165
01:22:17.700 --> 01:22:18.301
But the Steven,

3166
01:22:18.301 --> 01:22:20.060
this is actually watermelon flavor to,

3167
01:22:20.070 --> 01:22:20.491
you've never,

3168
01:22:20.491 --> 01:22:21.324
you don't know.

3169
01:22:21.330 --> 01:22:22.140
No.

3170
01:22:22.140 --> 01:22:22.500
Oh,

3171
01:22:22.500 --> 01:22:26.760
I need to turn you on to the Douchey as commercial in the history of the

3172
01:22:26.761 --> 01:22:27.570
universe.

3173
01:22:27.570 --> 01:22:28.351
It's a commercial.

3174
01:22:28.351 --> 01:22:29.190
So douchey.

3175
01:22:29.430 --> 01:22:31.380
You have to think that it's a subtle parody.

3176
01:22:31.530 --> 01:22:33.780
You have to think of someone was like someone else.

3177
01:22:33.781 --> 01:22:36.750
Someone hate Stephen Dorff and they talked him into doing things and they're

3178
01:22:36.751 --> 01:22:36.871
like,

3179
01:22:36.871 --> 01:22:37.240
listen,

3180
01:22:37.240 --> 01:22:38.220
he's an EGOMANIAC.

3181
01:22:38.221 --> 01:22:39.990
We're going to talk him into doing this fucking commercial.

3182
01:22:39.991 --> 01:22:40.231
It was like,

3183
01:22:40.231 --> 01:22:41.520
there's no way he's going to do this commercial.

3184
01:22:41.521 --> 01:22:42.360
I'm telling you,

3185
01:22:42.570 --> 01:22:43.920
I can talk this motherfucker.

3186
01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:45.460
Aw Steve,

3187
01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:46.470
we want you to write this.

3188
01:22:46.471 --> 01:22:47.790
We want it to be in your voice.

3189
01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:50.220
We want you to sell these cigarettes.

3190
01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:51.480
You gotta you gotta see this?

3191
01:22:52.460 --> 01:22:55.670
<v 8>I'm tired of being a walking astrick negative too.</v>

3192
01:22:56.150 --> 01:22:58.520
I'm tired of feeling guilty every time I want to light up.

3193
01:22:58.850 --> 01:22:59.690
I'm Steven door.

3194
01:22:59.900 --> 01:23:03.830
I've been a smoker for 20 years and I just found the smarter alternative.

3195
01:23:05.310 --> 01:23:10.280
Blue e six blue lets me enjoy smoking without it effecting the people around it

3196
01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:13.980
because it's not tobacco's my favorite part.

3197
01:23:14.270 --> 01:23:19.160
The deep means no APP and slow with blue.

3198
01:23:19.180 --> 01:23:21.720
Can you get smoke at a basketball game if you want to?

3199
01:23:22.230 --> 01:23:24.990
And how about not having to go outside every 10 minutes when you're in a bar

3200
01:23:24.991 --> 01:23:25.824
with your friends?

3201
01:23:26.160 --> 01:23:28.410
The point is you can smoke blue virtually anywhere.

3202
01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:33.690
We're all adults here.

3203
01:23:34.710 --> 01:23:36.180
It's time we take our freedom back.

3204
01:23:37.140 --> 01:23:38.030
<v 9>Come on guys.</v>

3205
01:23:38.870 --> 01:23:40.160
Rise from the ashes.

3206
01:23:42.250 --> 01:23:43.330
<v 0>Take your freedom back.</v>

3207
01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:45.073
Focus on

3208
01:23:47.380 --> 01:23:49.090
the long slow draw at the end.

3209
01:23:49.150 --> 01:23:50.350
Oh that uh,

3210
01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:50.900
that's,

3211
01:23:50.900 --> 01:23:51.733
uh,

3212
01:23:52.270 --> 01:23:52.940
do you ever,

3213
01:23:52.940 --> 01:23:53.890
there's a douchey or one then your,

3214
01:23:53.891 --> 01:23:54.161
your,

3215
01:23:54.161 --> 01:23:55.120
your show every scene.

3216
01:23:55.121 --> 01:23:55.954
The Brad Pitt one.

3217
01:23:56.350 --> 01:23:57.610
Is it like a Japanese one?

3218
01:23:58.470 --> 01:24:00.820
I've never seen the Brad Pitt Chanel number five commercial.

3219
01:24:01.390 --> 01:24:02.200
I don't think so.

3220
01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:02.621
Oh,

3221
01:24:02.621 --> 01:24:03.011
sweet.

3222
01:24:03.011 --> 01:24:03.401
Jesus.

3223
01:24:03.401 --> 01:24:04.180
You must see this.

3224
01:24:04.180 --> 01:24:04.511
Oh wait,

3225
01:24:04.511 --> 01:24:04.721
wait.

3226
01:24:04.721 --> 01:24:05.554
There's a new one.

3227
01:24:05.650 --> 01:24:06.130
Wait,

3228
01:24:06.130 --> 01:24:07.210
we should watch this new thing.

3229
01:24:07.211 --> 01:24:08.940
That is a new brand pitch and element.

3230
01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:10.390
There's a new commercial.

3231
01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:11.410
Really need money.

3232
01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:12.400
A new commercial was,

3233
01:24:12.430 --> 01:24:13.263
that's uh,

3234
01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:14.120
what I'm,

3235
01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:14.400
what,

3236
01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:15.050
what?

3237
01:24:15.050 --> 01:24:15.880
All right,

3238
01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:16.900
Courtney,

3239
01:24:16.990 --> 01:24:17.690
what is it?

3240
01:24:17.690 --> 01:24:17.980
Uh,

3241
01:24:17.980 --> 01:24:18.813
Courtney love.

3242
01:24:19.810 --> 01:24:20.560
Have you seen that?

3243
01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:23.740
It's kind of like at the same idea as what we just watched it,

3244
01:24:23.741 --> 01:24:24.574
but with Courtney love.

3245
01:24:24.990 --> 01:24:25.420
Yeah.

3246
01:24:25.420 --> 01:24:26.253
Hit it.

3247
01:24:28.570 --> 01:24:29.403
<v 9>Okay.</v>

3248
01:24:29.770 --> 01:24:31.300
<v 0>Enjoy presents.</v>

3249
01:24:31.570 --> 01:24:32.470
That's another company.

3250
01:24:35.550 --> 01:24:36.420
Is that Courtney love?

3251
01:24:36.490 --> 01:24:37.323
No,

3252
01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:38.793
never know.

3253
01:24:39.150 --> 01:24:39.983
It's been a while.

3254
01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:43.353
<v 10>That's Francis being,</v>

3255
01:24:43.870 --> 01:24:44.231
okay.

3256
01:24:44.231 --> 01:24:45.820
So we're watching for folks,

3257
01:24:45.821 --> 01:24:48.580
let's say at home or watching some of them elegantly dressed.

3258
01:24:48.610 --> 01:24:49.270
Old Lady.

3259
01:24:49.270 --> 01:24:49.570
Uh,

3260
01:24:49.570 --> 01:24:54.570
she has us a lot of jewelry on and she is walking up to Courtney love.

3261
01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:57.340
Who's looks better than usual?

3262
01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:01.260
<v 0>You can't smoke in here.</v>

3263
01:25:03.070 --> 01:25:04.120
Relax.

3264
01:25:04.570 --> 01:25:05.403
It's a fucking hand.

3265
01:25:05.470 --> 01:25:10.470
<v 9>[inaudible]</v>

3266
01:25:14.700 --> 01:25:15.533
<v 0>that was way better.</v>

3267
01:25:16.430 --> 01:25:17.350
<v 9>Sort of</v>

3268
01:25:19.060 --> 01:25:20.690
<v 0>at commercial uses the word fucking dude,</v>

3269
01:25:20.850 --> 01:25:21.683
but it's,

3270
01:25:22.380 --> 01:25:22.880
it's I me,

3271
01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:23.571
I guess it's better,

3272
01:25:23.571 --> 01:25:28.150
but I mean it's like you want to be the con that smokes those cigarettes and I

3273
01:25:28.151 --> 01:25:29.570
actually like that better than,

3274
01:25:29.571 --> 01:25:30.260
than a regular cigarette.

3275
01:25:30.260 --> 01:25:30.650
It's,

3276
01:25:30.650 --> 01:25:33.560
I guess it's more rock and roll than the other commercial.

3277
01:25:34.190 --> 01:25:34.910
Yeah.

3278
01:25:34.910 --> 01:25:36.290
You know it's better.

3279
01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:38.360
It's lucky watch the Brad Pitt one on your own,

3280
01:25:38.361 --> 01:25:40.820
but it's the only thing that's even do shit in the Stephen Dorff from Russia,

3281
01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:42.950
the Brad Pitt when when will turn your stomach,

3282
01:25:43.310 --> 01:25:44.870
because Brad Pitt's got like a billion dollars.

3283
01:25:45.110 --> 01:25:46.070
It doesn't make any sense.

3284
01:25:46.550 --> 01:25:46.970
Well,

3285
01:25:46.970 --> 01:25:48.320
I guess he got paid like crazy.

3286
01:25:48.321 --> 01:25:49.154
Millions.

3287
01:25:49.850 --> 01:25:50.381
Maybe me.

3288
01:25:50.381 --> 01:25:52.220
Maybe he's built a hut and Taiwan.

3289
01:25:52.690 --> 01:25:55.160
I saw Seinfeld doing a corporate once and I was like,

3290
01:25:55.161 --> 01:25:59.180
how much money do they have to pay Seinfeld to do a quarter?

3291
01:25:59.190 --> 01:26:00.710
A lot of those guys loved that Shit.

3292
01:26:00.740 --> 01:26:00.951
You know,

3293
01:26:00.951 --> 01:26:03.700
Jay Leno makes a huge amount of money on that stuff.

3294
01:26:03.701 --> 01:26:03.990
That's

3295
01:26:03.990 --> 01:26:04.823
<v 4>like his gig.</v>

3296
01:26:04.870 --> 01:26:06.010
That's like a big joke though.

3297
01:26:06.011 --> 01:26:06.930
The Leno corporate,

3298
01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:07.991
is it a joke?

3299
01:26:07.991 --> 01:26:11.140
Don't you know that every comic apparently like when you sit on the couch and

3300
01:26:11.141 --> 01:26:11.531
talk to him,

3301
01:26:11.531 --> 01:26:11.771
he goes,

3302
01:26:11.771 --> 01:26:13.390
so why you're doing carpets.

3303
01:26:14.230 --> 01:26:16.460
Guess how much he loves because he does a lot of,

3304
01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:17.333
he loves them.

3305
01:26:17.820 --> 01:26:19.270
<v 0>Guess how much he got paid for it?</v>

3306
01:26:19.300 --> 01:26:20.430
Emma who got paid right?

3307
01:26:20.431 --> 01:26:21.241
Pickup paid to do that.

3308
01:26:21.241 --> 01:26:21.460
C'Mon.

3309
01:26:21.460 --> 01:26:21.780
Come on,

3310
01:26:21.780 --> 01:26:22.350
let me guess.

3311
01:26:22.350 --> 01:26:22.831
Let me guess.

3312
01:26:22.831 --> 01:26:23.310
Okay,

3313
01:26:23.310 --> 01:26:24.143
how much,

3314
01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:26.160
uh,

3315
01:26:26.850 --> 01:26:27.683
11 million.

3316
01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:28.793
11 million.

3317
01:26:28.890 --> 01:26:30.780
What would you say to 4 million?

3318
01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:32.370
It's actually seven,

3319
01:26:33.690 --> 01:26:34.660
cause I know Seinfeld.

3320
01:26:34.670 --> 01:26:36.630
$1 million to sell your soul.

3321
01:26:36.770 --> 01:26:37.603
7 million.

3322
01:26:38.010 --> 01:26:39.000
It's so bad.

3323
01:26:39.450 --> 01:26:39.960
It's so,

3324
01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:41.190
it's so stupid.

3325
01:26:41.370 --> 01:26:41.641
Okay,

3326
01:26:41.641 --> 01:26:42.421
you got to see it now.

3327
01:26:42.421 --> 01:26:42.900
Play it now.

3328
01:26:42.900 --> 01:26:43.733
What'd you do it?

3329
01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:45.210
Oh me for 7 million.

3330
01:26:45.211 --> 01:26:45.720
No,

3331
01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:49.050
you wouldn't do it for $7 million of that because I don't need 7 million.

3332
01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:49.680
You know,

3333
01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:51.930
if I was broke and I did before,

3334
01:26:51.931 --> 01:26:54.180
I did fear factor before it did news radio and you said,

3335
01:26:54.181 --> 01:26:54.271
hey,

3336
01:26:54.271 --> 01:26:56.610
you want to do this really douchey Chanel number five commercial.

3337
01:26:56.820 --> 01:26:58.800
We'll pay 7 million fun.

3338
01:26:59.150 --> 01:27:00.330
Some horrible commercials with me.

3339
01:27:00.700 --> 01:27:01.430
This is,

3340
01:27:01.430 --> 01:27:04.500
this commercial though is so it's so ridiculous.

3341
01:27:04.501 --> 01:27:04.741
Like,

3342
01:27:04.741 --> 01:27:05.700
as a comedian,

3343
01:27:05.940 --> 01:27:08.070
you would have such a hard time doing this commercial.

3344
01:27:08.300 --> 01:27:10.380
It's really hard to do.

3345
01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:14.730
I have to some shit players play it because it's so preposterous.

3346
01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:15.780
You watch it and you go,

3347
01:27:15.781 --> 01:27:16.561
come on Brad.

3348
01:27:16.561 --> 01:27:17.341
What is going on?

3349
01:27:17.341 --> 01:27:18.174
A journey.

3350
01:27:18.570 --> 01:27:19.500
Every journey ends,

3351
01:27:19.530 --> 01:27:20.363
but we go on

3352
01:27:22.280 --> 01:27:23.021
twirled turns.

3353
01:27:23.021 --> 01:27:23.730
When we turned him,

3354
01:27:23.730 --> 01:27:24.563
his

3355
01:27:26.020 --> 01:27:27.250
plans disappear.

3356
01:27:27.670 --> 01:27:28.310
But look at him.

3357
01:27:28.310 --> 01:27:28.690
Look at you.

3358
01:27:28.690 --> 01:27:29.523
Take home.

3359
01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:30.581
You're not really doing this,

3360
01:27:30.581 --> 01:27:30.970
Brad.

3361
01:27:30.970 --> 01:27:31.421
You're looking.

3362
01:27:31.421 --> 01:27:31.680
You're not.

3363
01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:32.710
This is not really,

3364
01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:33.311
you're acting.

3365
01:27:33.311 --> 01:27:34.990
You Fuck my fate.

3366
01:27:36.300 --> 01:27:38.610
My fortune number five.

3367
01:27:40.060 --> 01:27:40.893
Hold on.

3368
01:27:41.290 --> 01:27:42.123
Inevitable.

3369
01:27:43.810 --> 01:27:43.961
<v 11>No,</v>

3370
01:27:43.961 --> 01:27:44.794
come on.

3371
01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:46.280
<v 0>That's disgusting.</v>

3372
01:27:46.970 --> 01:27:47.750
That's so bad.

3373
01:27:47.750 --> 01:27:48.021
I mean,

3374
01:27:48.021 --> 01:27:48.231
shit,

3375
01:27:48.231 --> 01:27:48.711
I might do it.

3376
01:27:48.711 --> 01:27:49.190
I'm sorry.

3377
01:27:49.190 --> 01:27:50.023
<v 4>Okay.</v>

3378
01:27:51.220 --> 01:27:53.700
Was that one of those things where he just goes,

3379
01:27:53.730 --> 01:27:54.091
oh yeah,

3380
01:27:54.091 --> 01:27:55.920
we went to get that house up at the ski resort.

3381
01:27:56.050 --> 01:27:57.600
Let's do it,

3382
01:27:57.980 --> 01:27:58.280
<v 0>Dan.</v>

3383
01:27:58.280 --> 01:27:58.521
I mean,

3384
01:27:58.521 --> 01:27:58.740
I,

3385
01:27:58.740 --> 01:27:59.573
I guess,

3386
01:27:59.660 --> 01:28:00.290
I guess,

3387
01:28:00.290 --> 01:28:00.561
look,

3388
01:28:00.561 --> 01:28:02.390
he's involved in a lot of charitable venture.

3389
01:28:02.391 --> 01:28:03.800
So who am I to judge?

3390
01:28:04.070 --> 01:28:05.850
And guess what he does with his mind?

3391
01:28:06.100 --> 01:28:07.430
He might do something really amazing.

3392
01:28:07.670 --> 01:28:10.160
<v 4>There's a banking commercial and uh,</v>

3393
01:28:10.310 --> 01:28:11.390
I forget what the bank is.

3394
01:28:11.391 --> 01:28:15.170
It's one of those like trading things into commercial and I hear the voice and

3395
01:28:15.171 --> 01:28:15.891
I'm good with voices.

3396
01:28:15.891 --> 01:28:16.430
I go,

3397
01:28:16.430 --> 01:28:20.630
that's Matt Damon and he's doing a banking commercial and he's doing a voice.

3398
01:28:20.631 --> 01:28:23.460
Why does Matt Damon have to do fucking voiceovers?

3399
01:28:23.461 --> 01:28:24.350
He's got enough money.

3400
01:28:24.530 --> 01:28:25.311
So I Google it,

3401
01:28:25.311 --> 01:28:25.880
look it up.

3402
01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:29.720
Apparently he donated all the money to charity and so,

3403
01:28:30.050 --> 01:28:30.500
uh,

3404
01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:31.390
because it,

3405
01:28:31.460 --> 01:28:34.250
and I read there was the hypocrisy of Matt Damon here.

3406
01:28:34.251 --> 01:28:35.510
He is a guy who,

3407
01:28:35.780 --> 01:28:38.690
who he was the voiceover in inside job,

3408
01:28:38.691 --> 01:28:38.901
the,

3409
01:28:38.901 --> 01:28:41.150
the movie about the banks and he's always,

3410
01:28:41.151 --> 01:28:45.020
he always very liberal and he's been very critical of the banks and here he is

3411
01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:46.580
doing a fucking commercial for the bags.

3412
01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:48.860
So I guess it was one of these things where he just said,

3413
01:28:49.100 --> 01:28:49.933
you know what,

3414
01:28:50.450 --> 01:28:51.200
I'll do it.

3415
01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:54.290
We're going to take all that money and I'd like to see the charity gave it to,

3416
01:28:54.291 --> 01:28:58.160
I hope it's something like a lobby against the banks.

3417
01:28:58.840 --> 01:28:59.231
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

3418
01:28:59.231 --> 01:29:00.610
that would be a smart thing to do.

3419
01:29:00.650 --> 01:29:01.800
Use their against them.

3420
01:29:01.830 --> 01:29:02.040
But

3421
01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:02.641
<v 5>it's still,</v>

3422
01:29:02.641 --> 01:29:03.570
it's still weird.

3423
01:29:03.571 --> 01:29:04.404
You know,

3424
01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:06.810
I have to have sex with Brad pay for $7 million.

3425
01:29:07.620 --> 01:29:09.300
I think it would cost more than that.

3426
01:29:09.630 --> 01:29:09.810
Yeah.

3427
01:29:09.810 --> 01:29:10.643
I don't think Brad would have.

3428
01:29:10.740 --> 01:29:11.320
Yeah,

3429
01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:12.720
I really don't think Brad would be like,

3430
01:29:12.721 --> 01:29:14.070
and what do I get out of this?

3431
01:29:14.090 --> 01:29:14.200
Well,

3432
01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:15.920
what if he just was into it?

3433
01:29:16.040 --> 01:29:17.580
It sounds like a fetish thing for him.

3434
01:29:17.710 --> 01:29:18.960
It could be hairy guy.

3435
01:29:19.500 --> 01:29:23.340
I'm sure there's a lot of people that are like willing to do that.

3436
01:29:24.430 --> 01:29:25.263
Yeah.

3437
01:29:25.330 --> 01:29:26.880
So 1 million bucks.

3438
01:29:26.910 --> 01:29:27.091
Hey,

3439
01:29:27.091 --> 01:29:30.900
I'm putting the offer up there right now for 25 grand and some coke,

3440
01:29:31.490 --> 01:29:31.800
you know,

3441
01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:34.920
25 grants from coke and who knows who she left fuck her ass.

3442
01:29:35.250 --> 01:29:35.850
You know,

3443
01:29:35.850 --> 01:29:37.110
probably a lot of craziness going on.

3444
01:29:37.111 --> 01:29:38.480
A lot of spitting in people's mouths.

3445
01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:38.880
Well,

3446
01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:39.713
I've talked about you,

3447
01:29:39.730 --> 01:29:40.820
you know your Webcams,

3448
01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:41.010
you,

3449
01:29:41.010 --> 01:29:42.090
you led me onto that.

3450
01:29:42.100 --> 01:29:42.810
Um,

3451
01:29:42.810 --> 01:29:42.991
uh,

3452
01:29:42.991 --> 01:29:43.470
what's it called?

3453
01:29:43.470 --> 01:29:43.701
Freaking.

3454
01:29:43.701 --> 01:29:44.700
I'm starting my free cams.

3455
01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:49.270
Those girls that go on there can say what countries they want to be shown in.

3456
01:29:49.400 --> 01:29:49.770
Right?

3457
01:29:49.770 --> 01:29:51.690
So basically a girl can just check off.

3458
01:29:51.691 --> 01:29:53.130
She doesn't want to be seen in the United States,

3459
01:29:53.131 --> 01:29:53.521
Canada,

3460
01:29:53.521 --> 01:29:54.001
Australia.

3461
01:29:54.001 --> 01:29:54.330
Hey,

3462
01:29:54.330 --> 01:29:57.420
any English speaking place where she might possibly know someone,

3463
01:29:57.470 --> 01:29:57.750
right,

3464
01:29:57.750 --> 01:30:00.600
but let the rest of the world just jerk off to her.

3465
01:30:00.870 --> 01:30:03.810
Never ever going to see one of those people ever again.

3466
01:30:04.110 --> 01:30:04.710
And it's like,

3467
01:30:04.710 --> 01:30:08.250
I think there's so many girls on there that we don't know about the girls,

3468
01:30:08.251 --> 01:30:09.084
you know?

3469
01:30:09.660 --> 01:30:13.380
Because I never see my guy friends that don't have money,

3470
01:30:13.590 --> 01:30:16.260
always have to pick up like second and third jobs.

3471
01:30:16.710 --> 01:30:18.600
My girlfriends that don't have money,

3472
01:30:19.020 --> 01:30:21.510
it's just life CZ and it's all,

3473
01:30:21.720 --> 01:30:23.760
they all say they're just responsible,

3474
01:30:23.790 --> 01:30:24.623
whatever.

3475
01:30:25.700 --> 01:30:26.550
I'm like,

3476
01:30:27.450 --> 01:30:28.380
where are you getting money?

3477
01:30:28.381 --> 01:30:32.550
And I'm convinced they're all on my free cams and like Latvia and Estonia and he

3478
01:30:32.570 --> 01:30:37.320
brought probably they're all fucking stacking up bitcoins like a motherfucker

3479
01:30:38.790 --> 01:30:39.623
tokens.

3480
01:30:39.630 --> 01:30:40.230
Yeah.

3481
01:30:40.230 --> 01:30:40.870
Stagen up.

3482
01:30:40.870 --> 01:30:42.260
Damn bitcoins son.

3483
01:30:42.360 --> 01:30:44.070
You think that bid clean things going to work?

3484
01:30:44.130 --> 01:30:44.963
I would like it to work.

3485
01:30:45.450 --> 01:30:46.410
I think it'd be interesting.

3486
01:30:46.590 --> 01:30:49.770
I think it'd be interesting if there was an alternative currency that a bunch of

3487
01:30:49.771 --> 01:30:51.030
people agreed to that was stable.

3488
01:30:51.440 --> 01:30:51.750
You know,

3489
01:30:51.750 --> 01:30:52.201
if you could,

3490
01:30:52.201 --> 01:30:55.860
if you could find a way to circumvent the financial system,

3491
01:30:55.861 --> 01:30:59.340
that would be a way to defeat it to defined one that we all agreed on,

3492
01:30:59.341 --> 01:31:00.360
that everybody got together and said,

3493
01:31:00.361 --> 01:31:00.751
you know what?

3494
01:31:00.751 --> 01:31:01.980
Fuck all this craziness.

3495
01:31:02.160 --> 01:31:02.550
All right,

3496
01:31:02.550 --> 01:31:02.940
let's,

3497
01:31:02.940 --> 01:31:05.670
let's put our resources into this other thing.

3498
01:31:06.060 --> 01:31:08.880
The problem is that's when you find out how corrupt the system really is and

3499
01:31:08.881 --> 01:31:09.330
that's when you,

3500
01:31:09.330 --> 01:31:12.290
cause they would never let you establish an alternative set of currency.

3501
01:31:12.291 --> 01:31:12.900
Right.

3502
01:31:12.900 --> 01:31:17.190
I think you'd end up dead most likely they would discourage it hardly,

3503
01:31:17.580 --> 01:31:17.941
you know?

3504
01:31:17.941 --> 01:31:21.930
I mean the amount of money that would be lost if there was a valid alternative

3505
01:31:21.931 --> 01:31:24.810
to the dollar or the ruble or the whatever the fuck you're using.

3506
01:31:24.810 --> 01:31:25.170
Yeah.

3507
01:31:25.170 --> 01:31:29.970
If there was some nationwide or global currency that we all agreed to that was

3508
01:31:29.971 --> 01:31:32.010
like established and was like really,

3509
01:31:32.250 --> 01:31:33.360
really strong,

3510
01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:35.220
that would fuck everything,

3511
01:31:35.221 --> 01:31:35.551
man.

3512
01:31:35.551 --> 01:31:35.820
Yeah.

3513
01:31:35.820 --> 01:31:40.170
All this global power grab would be in the toilet and it third world countries

3514
01:31:40.171 --> 01:31:42.900
would know like when everybody has the same value on their dollar,

3515
01:31:43.500 --> 01:31:44.910
when the dollar is the same value.

3516
01:31:44.911 --> 01:31:45.720
Which I,

3517
01:31:45.720 --> 01:31:45.970
I,

3518
01:31:45.970 --> 01:31:47.770
I've looked into this and thought about it and,

3519
01:31:47.771 --> 01:31:49.920
and it's really confusing but,

3520
01:31:50.040 --> 01:31:52.020
and I don't know enough about currencies and,

3521
01:31:52.380 --> 01:31:56.440
and what would happen would the value of it,

3522
01:31:57.210 --> 01:32:00.010
because you can trade internationally then and there's

3523
01:32:00.010 --> 01:32:04.170
<v 4>no one able to monitor it and there's no embargoes on there.</v>

3524
01:32:04.180 --> 01:32:08.440
Wouldn't it wouldn't be able to be taxed because they don't know.

3525
01:32:08.620 --> 01:32:08.831
It's,

3526
01:32:08.831 --> 01:32:09.280
it's,

3527
01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:10.150
it's interesting.

3528
01:32:10.360 --> 01:32:10.871
It's very,

3529
01:32:10.871 --> 01:32:12.970
it would eventually have to get taxed

3530
01:32:13.170 --> 01:32:13.860
<v 6>somehow.</v>

3531
01:32:13.860 --> 01:32:14.131
Yeah,

3532
01:32:14.131 --> 01:32:15.450
you would have to pay for things,

3533
01:32:15.870 --> 01:32:16.321
you know,

3534
01:32:16.321 --> 01:32:20.430
it's really becomes a matter of government over bureaucracy and use it.

3535
01:32:20.431 --> 01:32:23.430
Now if the real problem is and stuff bureaucracy,

3536
01:32:23.490 --> 01:32:28.200
it gets to a point where you start creating jobs that aren't necessary and then

3537
01:32:28.201 --> 01:32:28.680
you say,

3538
01:32:28.680 --> 01:32:30.510
oh we created x amount of jobs as quarter.

3539
01:32:30.540 --> 01:32:31.373
Like that's like a,

3540
01:32:31.830 --> 01:32:33.120
people love to do shit like that.

3541
01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:36.990
And sometimes those jobs are really good and sometimes those jobs are government

3542
01:32:36.991 --> 01:32:38.970
jobs and what government jobs get established,

3543
01:32:39.130 --> 01:32:41.010
the very rarely they get removed.

3544
01:32:41.011 --> 01:32:41.760
You know what I mean?

3545
01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:44.280
Like they might slash things that there's funding,

3546
01:32:44.281 --> 01:32:47.730
but if there's money they would like to like keep jobs going.

3547
01:32:47.731 --> 01:32:50.650
And create new jobs in government and create new laws.

3548
01:32:50.670 --> 01:32:52.020
The new jobs are in place.

3549
01:32:52.021 --> 01:32:55.920
Like that's one of the big arguments and not making pot legal because you would

3550
01:32:55.921 --> 01:32:59.880
lose like a lot of people that are in the business of locking people up for pot

3551
01:33:00.030 --> 01:33:03.670
and arresting Ponte dealers and then all of a sudden the pharmaceutical company

3552
01:33:03.671 --> 01:33:04.351
is going to lose money.

3553
01:33:04.351 --> 01:33:06.120
What are they going to let people go as well?

3554
01:33:06.121 --> 01:33:07.290
Like how does that work?

3555
01:33:07.560 --> 01:33:08.030
It's kind of,

3556
01:33:08.030 --> 01:33:10.620
it's a weird financial situation where the,

3557
01:33:10.740 --> 01:33:11.281
the uh,

3558
01:33:11.281 --> 01:33:11.790
the,

3559
01:33:11.790 --> 01:33:16.650
the resources and the impact of the control of the resources shifts and this,

3560
01:33:16.651 --> 01:33:20.070
so that's like a financial decision and that's one of the real problems with

3561
01:33:20.071 --> 01:33:22.060
making anything that sat popular,

3562
01:33:22.061 --> 01:33:22.411
illegal.

3563
01:33:22.411 --> 01:33:23.340
While it's illegal,

3564
01:33:23.580 --> 01:33:25.770
it's like financially it creates a real issue.

3565
01:33:25.820 --> 01:33:26.270
<v 4>Well,</v>

3566
01:33:26.270 --> 01:33:31.270
I also saw that a lot of the reason the Po hasn't become legal yet is because

3567
01:33:32.750 --> 01:33:34.940
the regulation isn't in place yet.

3568
01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.730
They haven't been able to create the bureaucracy around it.

3569
01:33:38.120 --> 01:33:41.780
And a lot of times they've done things like if you look around the world,

3570
01:33:41.810 --> 01:33:46.760
the lack of regulation has created fucking like you look at what happened the

3571
01:33:46.760 --> 01:33:48.080
Soviet Union when it dismantled.

3572
01:33:48.350 --> 01:33:48.770
Well,

3573
01:33:48.770 --> 01:33:49.041
yeah.

3574
01:33:49.041 --> 01:33:51.200
Then they sold off the gas companies,

3575
01:33:51.201 --> 01:33:56.201
the electric companies and the Russian mafia just became like billionaires

3576
01:33:56.930 --> 01:33:57.560
overnight.

3577
01:33:57.560 --> 01:34:01.460
People were able to buy the electric company or by you know the,

3578
01:34:01.580 --> 01:34:01.701
<v 6>well,</v>

3579
01:34:01.701 --> 01:34:03.780
I think there was a lot more to the collapse of the Soviet,

3580
01:34:04.110 --> 01:34:04.261
<v 4>well,</v>

3581
01:34:04.261 --> 01:34:04.381
no,

3582
01:34:04.381 --> 01:34:04.501
no,

3583
01:34:04.501 --> 01:34:07.190
but what I'm saying is they had two different currencies in,

3584
01:34:07.500 --> 01:34:09.400
in Russia at that time or the Soviet Union,

3585
01:34:09.420 --> 01:34:10.410
the two different ones,

3586
01:34:10.411 --> 01:34:13.980
two different currencies and they were using one to buy up the other one.

3587
01:34:14.100 --> 01:34:14.431
I'm like,

3588
01:34:14.431 --> 01:34:15.810
people were smart enough to say,

3589
01:34:15.811 --> 01:34:17.670
let's buy all this currency.

3590
01:34:17.671 --> 01:34:20.970
I read this book called Rogue Economics about what happens with lack of

3591
01:34:20.971 --> 01:34:25.560
regulation and they were then when I read about pot being legal,

3592
01:34:25.561 --> 01:34:27.930
it was like if it gets legalized,

3593
01:34:27.931 --> 01:34:28.561
what happens?

3594
01:34:28.561 --> 01:34:31.830
The corporations might be able to come in and push out all the growers,

3595
01:34:32.040 --> 01:34:33.210
push out all the,

3596
01:34:33.510 --> 01:34:33.841
you know,

3597
01:34:33.841 --> 01:34:34.171
the,

3598
01:34:34.171 --> 01:34:34.720
the,

3599
01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:37.070
the farmers or the Eagle.

3600
01:34:37.500 --> 01:34:38.520
If it does get legal,

3601
01:34:38.550 --> 01:34:39.720
how would they be able to do that?

3602
01:34:39.790 --> 01:34:42.570
Because the growers are established,

3603
01:34:42.571 --> 01:34:43.710
because let's say,

3604
01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:45.270
let's say the growers are established,

3605
01:34:45.271 --> 01:34:49.710
but let's say a big corporations come in and get involved,

3606
01:34:49.711 --> 01:34:49.990
like,

3607
01:34:49.990 --> 01:34:51.510
like the tobacco corporations.

3608
01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:52.513
But if they,

3609
01:34:52.530 --> 01:34:53.850
with all their money,

3610
01:34:54.150 --> 01:34:55.320
buy up all the pot,

3611
01:34:55.770 --> 01:34:56.940
the pot fields,

3612
01:34:57.120 --> 01:34:57.841
everything,

3613
01:34:57.841 --> 01:34:58.030
like

3614
01:34:58.030 --> 01:34:58.230
<v 3>they,</v>

3615
01:34:58.230 --> 01:35:01.040
there is no way of actually like it.

3616
01:35:01.260 --> 01:35:04.020
It would be like opening the flood gates right away and it's like,

3617
01:35:04.021 --> 01:35:04.890
what's going to happen?

3618
01:35:05.220 --> 01:35:05.461
<v 7>Well,</v>

3619
01:35:05.461 --> 01:35:06.660
I don't understand what you're saying.

3620
01:35:06.810 --> 01:35:07.290
Well,

3621
01:35:07.290 --> 01:35:09.420
why would that stop the people who are already growing?

3622
01:35:09.800 --> 01:35:12.420
When we had that proposition to vote to make pot legal,

3623
01:35:12.510 --> 01:35:15.630
I was trying to read about it and I'm not even a big pot smoker,

3624
01:35:15.631 --> 01:35:15.961
but I was like,

3625
01:35:15.961 --> 01:35:16.171
come on,

3626
01:35:16.171 --> 01:35:17.370
we gotta fucking legalize this shit.

3627
01:35:17.371 --> 01:35:18.330
This is ridiculous.

3628
01:35:18.390 --> 01:35:19.050
And so like,

3629
01:35:19.050 --> 01:35:20.930
I did that with like a active,

3630
01:35:22.830 --> 01:35:22.981
<v 3>well,</v>

3631
01:35:22.981 --> 01:35:24.510
the referendum vote was like,

3632
01:35:24.511 --> 01:35:24.810
let's,

3633
01:35:24.810 --> 01:35:25.140
let's,

3634
01:35:25.140 --> 01:35:27.000
let's vote to make it legal.

3635
01:35:27.001 --> 01:35:28.740
And then I started reading and a lot of,

3636
01:35:28.741 --> 01:35:29.574
uh,

3637
01:35:29.670 --> 01:35:31.950
the like local Venice newspapers and stuff,

3638
01:35:31.951 --> 01:35:35.670
and they were saying that a lot of the people in Humboldt and Mendocino county

3639
01:35:35.671 --> 01:35:36.240
and all that,

3640
01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:41.240
that that were growers and stuff were against it because they were worried that

3641
01:35:41.761 --> 01:35:42.300
they would get it

3642
01:35:42.300 --> 01:35:43.133
<v 7>pushed out.</v>

3643
01:35:43.260 --> 01:35:44.370
I would say that's not true.

3644
01:35:44.730 --> 01:35:47.880
The reason why they're against it is because you can make a lot more money when

3645
01:35:47.881 --> 01:35:48.690
it's illegal.

3646
01:35:48.690 --> 01:35:49.590
That's why they're against it.

3647
01:35:49.620 --> 01:35:50.070
Okay.

3648
01:35:50.070 --> 01:35:50.590
That's it.

3649
01:35:50.590 --> 01:35:52.530
We got their argument a little little wrong.

3650
01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:53.341
And not only that,

3651
01:35:53.341 --> 01:35:55.470
a lot of those people were also against medical.

3652
01:35:55.860 --> 01:35:58.170
They like to keep it illegal because when it's illegal,

3653
01:35:58.171 --> 01:36:00.870
it's worth a lot more money and it's harder to find people to sell it.

3654
01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:02.400
It's hard to find people that are,

3655
01:36:02.430 --> 01:36:05.610
you could buy it from and so they can control the market

3656
01:36:05.950 --> 01:36:06.191
<v 3>well,</v>

3657
01:36:06.191 --> 01:36:07.510
but in that situation,

3658
01:36:07.960 --> 01:36:08.681
pot is legal.

3659
01:36:08.681 --> 01:36:10.810
There's going to be more money spent on marijuana.

3660
01:36:10.811 --> 01:36:11.260
If it is,

3661
01:36:11.260 --> 01:36:13.000
<v 7>it's just going to make more competition for them.</v>

3662
01:36:13.001 --> 01:36:13.421
That's all it.

3663
01:36:13.421 --> 01:36:16.420
Is there a reason why the growers don't want it is because a bunch of other

3664
01:36:16.421 --> 01:36:18.780
people are going to start growing and then the prices are gonna go down.

3665
01:36:19.150 --> 01:36:22.120
<v 3>Who would ultimately make the money on marijuana?</v>

3666
01:36:22.150 --> 01:36:23.290
Wouldn't it be corporations?

3667
01:36:23.450 --> 01:36:24.260
<v 7>A real issue.</v>

3668
01:36:24.260 --> 01:36:28.280
The real issue that's an undiscussed is something like Monsanto coming along and

3669
01:36:28.310 --> 01:36:32.090
owning strains of marijuana and eliminating the other strains.

3670
01:36:32.270 --> 01:36:34.370
That is a distinct possibility.

3671
01:36:34.490 --> 01:36:35.420
If you see what they've done,

3672
01:36:35.421 --> 01:36:37.970
who the fuck would have ever thought they'd be able to do what they've done with

3673
01:36:37.971 --> 01:36:38.630
corn?

3674
01:36:38.630 --> 01:36:42.650
Who the fuck would available to believe that they would be willing to,

3675
01:36:42.860 --> 01:36:44.870
that politicians would be willing to accept,

3676
01:36:44.900 --> 01:36:46.640
I don't know what the fuck they're getting paid.

3677
01:36:46.641 --> 01:36:48.740
I don't know how the fuck they're passing these laws,

3678
01:36:48.980 --> 01:36:50.680
like the Monsanto Protection Act,

3679
01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:54.350
all these different laws that allow genetically modified foods to be in your

3680
01:36:54.351 --> 01:36:58.550
supermarkets without labels because it's not clearly established whether or not

3681
01:36:58.551 --> 01:36:59.660
there are a hundred percent safe.

3682
01:36:59.750 --> 01:37:00.890
I know some of them are safe.

3683
01:37:01.050 --> 01:37:03.140
<v 3>If you ever question that and how it happens.</v>

3684
01:37:03.141 --> 01:37:03.951
Read the book.

3685
01:37:03.951 --> 01:37:04.640
Uh,

3686
01:37:04.640 --> 01:37:05.740
Lawrence Lessig book,

3687
01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:06.110
uh,

3688
01:37:06.110 --> 01:37:10.040
called Republic lost and he explains how all that government subsidies,

3689
01:37:10.310 --> 01:37:11.330
all of that shit happens.

3690
01:37:11.331 --> 01:37:11.721
And it's,

3691
01:37:11.721 --> 01:37:12.080
they,

3692
01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:13.520
they target it's the same way.

3693
01:37:13.700 --> 01:37:15.050
The defense mining corporation.

3694
01:37:15.051 --> 01:37:15.231
Yeah.

3695
01:37:15.231 --> 01:37:15.590
They,

3696
01:37:15.590 --> 01:37:19.220
but they target like a lobby group or a special interest group or a pack.

3697
01:37:19.490 --> 01:37:21.380
Will they,

3698
01:37:21.620 --> 01:37:24.140
it's not even that they have the resources to,

3699
01:37:24.620 --> 01:37:26.780
to just spend so much money.

3700
01:37:26.781 --> 01:37:27.890
What they do is they will,

3701
01:37:28.310 --> 01:37:29.990
it's almost like mafia technique.

3702
01:37:29.991 --> 01:37:32.210
Like they'll go to a congressman and say,

3703
01:37:32.480 --> 01:37:32.661
hey,

3704
01:37:32.661 --> 01:37:33.860
you're running into this guy,

3705
01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:35.270
you're anti guns.

3706
01:37:35.271 --> 01:37:35.901
He's pro guns.

3707
01:37:35.901 --> 01:37:38.270
We're going to give all our money to him and we're just going to,

3708
01:37:38.510 --> 01:37:39.860
so it's just the threat.

3709
01:37:39.980 --> 01:37:42.470
It's not we're spending money against you.

3710
01:37:42.471 --> 01:37:44.930
It's the threat of we're going to spend money against you.

3711
01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:47.860
So the politicians then fold and say they go

3712
01:37:47.860 --> 01:37:49.180
<v 7>with where the money is.</v>

3713
01:37:49.181 --> 01:37:52.090
I mean that's what I think it's 97% of the time or something.

3714
01:37:52.091 --> 01:37:53.500
That kind of candidate with the most money.

3715
01:37:53.700 --> 01:37:53.980
Yeah,

3716
01:37:53.980 --> 01:37:55.860
I'm sure it only makes sense.

3717
01:37:55.861 --> 01:37:55.981
I mean,

3718
01:37:55.981 --> 01:38:00.981
you have to have like a wildly popular platform for you to be accepted and you

3719
01:38:01.411 --> 01:38:02.940
don't have as much money and to be,

3720
01:38:02.941 --> 01:38:05.010
or you have to compete against a real jackass.

3721
01:38:05.710 --> 01:38:06.230
It's,

3722
01:38:06.230 --> 01:38:06.430
it's,

3723
01:38:06.430 --> 01:38:06.660
um,

3724
01:38:06.660 --> 01:38:07.590
it's a bot system,

3725
01:38:07.620 --> 01:38:08.101
you know,

3726
01:38:08.101 --> 01:38:11.250
and something like bitcoin or some alternative currency,

3727
01:38:11.251 --> 01:38:12.590
I know a lot of people poo poo it.

3728
01:38:12.690 --> 01:38:14.010
Maybe bitcoin's not the one,

3729
01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:15.840
but who the fuck saw bitcoin coming?

3730
01:38:15.870 --> 01:38:19.170
I never heard of anything about it until like a couple of years ago and now all

3731
01:38:19.171 --> 01:38:19.651
of a sudden,

3732
01:38:19.651 --> 01:38:19.831
you know,

3733
01:38:19.831 --> 01:38:22.140
you're hearing about it and like legitimate news sources and you're like,

3734
01:38:22.141 --> 01:38:22.441
Whoa,

3735
01:38:22.441 --> 01:38:23.280
what's going on yet?

3736
01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:28.520
And then coincidentally it crashes through the fucking floor and the value drops

3737
01:38:28.891 --> 01:38:30.870
and there's all sorts of fuckery involved with it.

3738
01:38:30.870 --> 01:38:32.100
So I did that happen,

3739
01:38:32.101 --> 01:38:32.950
the value drops,

3740
01:38:33.660 --> 01:38:35.130
bitcoin went through some,

3741
01:38:35.190 --> 01:38:35.761
but you know,

3742
01:38:35.761 --> 01:38:39.960
it's also people probably trying to profit or trying to capitalize on a system

3743
01:38:39.961 --> 01:38:41.280
that's not completely secure.

3744
01:38:41.970 --> 01:38:42.450
I don't know.

3745
01:38:42.450 --> 01:38:44.010
I don't understand finances that much.

3746
01:38:44.011 --> 01:38:45.360
I'm too add for that shit.

3747
01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:49.530
I got the APP and the and just wanting to play with it and see the bitcoin on.

3748
01:38:49.580 --> 01:38:49.860
Yeah,

3749
01:38:49.860 --> 01:38:51.510
I just wanted to see what was going on.

3750
01:38:51.840 --> 01:38:52.371
I get every,

3751
01:38:52.371 --> 01:38:52.601
Yap.

3752
01:38:52.601 --> 01:38:52.721
I,

3753
01:38:52.721 --> 01:38:53.220
I,

3754
01:38:53.220 --> 01:38:53.790
I,

3755
01:38:53.790 --> 01:38:54.960
have you done to Uber yet?

3756
01:38:55.110 --> 01:38:55.530
Oh sure.

3757
01:38:55.530 --> 01:38:55.651
Yeah.

3758
01:38:55.651 --> 01:38:56.310
I use it all the time.

3759
01:38:56.310 --> 01:38:56.880
It's amazing.

3760
01:38:56.880 --> 01:38:57.590
Awesome.

3761
01:38:57.590 --> 01:39:01.470
Did you see the guy who is selling a house in Canada with a bitcoin?

3762
01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:02.330
Really?

3763
01:39:02.330 --> 01:39:02.490
Yeah.

3764
01:39:02.490 --> 01:39:05.070
He wanted to acquire a lot of bitcoins and he had a piece of property that it

3765
01:39:05.071 --> 01:39:05.590
wasn't using.

3766
01:39:05.590 --> 01:39:07.740
It was like a house on a lake or on a river,

3767
01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:08.701
like a rural,

3768
01:39:08.701 --> 01:39:09.750
like vacation house.

3769
01:39:09.990 --> 01:39:12.750
It's like 300 grand or something like that and he's selling it on bitcoin.

3770
01:39:12.751 --> 01:39:16.230
He wants 300,000 bitcoins or whatever the fucking equivalent is.

3771
01:39:16.650 --> 01:39:16.801
Well,

3772
01:39:16.801 --> 01:39:17.520
if you look at age,

3773
01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:20.400
I mean it's been going on on like games like I don't play but like world of

3774
01:39:20.401 --> 01:39:21.780
Warcraft and that stuff.

3775
01:39:21.781 --> 01:39:22.614
Those people,

3776
01:39:22.680 --> 01:39:24.330
they had a whole south park episode about it,

3777
01:39:24.780 --> 01:39:28.020
like a where they have the little kids working,

3778
01:39:28.021 --> 01:39:32.550
playing the video games that they can acquire these coins or whatever it was,

3779
01:39:32.551 --> 01:39:33.220
whatever the,

3780
01:39:33.220 --> 01:39:36.960
the value on the game because that happens in video games all the time where

3781
01:39:36.961 --> 01:39:38.490
people try to acquire these,

3782
01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:42.720
what's the legit service like people will pay people in foreign countries,

3783
01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:44.490
like Third World Company countries,

3784
01:39:44.700 --> 01:39:45.031
we'll,

3785
01:39:45.031 --> 01:39:48.720
we'll play games all night with your character.

3786
01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:51.510
Like you give them your character if you're a few months and you come back in

3787
01:39:51.511 --> 01:39:55.680
your characters like a master wizard because these are like fucking total super

3788
01:39:55.681 --> 01:39:56.514
nerd games.

3789
01:39:56.790 --> 01:39:59.490
It's not like you're playing checkers or chess or,

3790
01:39:59.790 --> 01:40:00.390
or even,

3791
01:40:00.390 --> 01:40:00.900
you know,

3792
01:40:00.900 --> 01:40:03.780
I used to do that with my friends on Madden when they would leave and we all

3793
01:40:03.781 --> 01:40:04.860
lived together down at the beach.

3794
01:40:04.890 --> 01:40:05.430
They would leave.

3795
01:40:05.430 --> 01:40:08.350
I would play as their team and just lose their place.

3796
01:40:09.750 --> 01:40:10.583
That's funny.

3797
01:40:10.980 --> 01:40:11.191
Yeah.

3798
01:40:11.191 --> 01:40:12.000
That's funny.

3799
01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:12.840
But the,

3800
01:40:12.870 --> 01:40:15.990
there's one of the Santa shows that I ever watched was a documentary on this

3801
01:40:15.991 --> 01:40:18.210
family that was addicted to world of Warcraft.

3802
01:40:18.540 --> 01:40:19.373
One of those games.

3803
01:40:19.380 --> 01:40:20.370
It was world of Warcraft,

3804
01:40:20.430 --> 01:40:21.263
but it was a family,

3805
01:40:21.330 --> 01:40:23.130
a husband and wife and a kid.

3806
01:40:23.490 --> 01:40:26.400
And the wife would always get bummed out when she had to take care of the baby

3807
01:40:26.401 --> 01:40:27.840
because the husband could play the game.

3808
01:40:27.841 --> 01:40:28.890
And she was like complaining.

3809
01:40:29.100 --> 01:40:32.340
She's got his fucking newborn and she doesn't want it because she wants to get

3810
01:40:32.341 --> 01:40:33.720
back to our character in the game.

3811
01:40:33.721 --> 01:40:34.110
And it was,

3812
01:40:34.110 --> 01:40:37.290
it was really depressing cause like you imagine if you,

3813
01:40:37.291 --> 01:40:40.200
you're essentially being born into a house full of addicts.

3814
01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:41.393
They're addicts,

3815
01:40:41.460 --> 01:40:42.241
but it's not heroin.

3816
01:40:42.241 --> 01:40:43.220
It's world of Warcraft.

3817
01:40:43.230 --> 01:40:44.580
I mean they are addicted to this.

3818
01:40:44.581 --> 01:40:45.450
They're completely,

3819
01:40:45.451 --> 01:40:46.520
totally focused on,

3820
01:40:46.540 --> 01:40:49.410
that's why I hate when people go drugs and alcohol ruined their life.

3821
01:40:49.411 --> 01:40:51.750
It's like drugs and alcohol didn't.

3822
01:40:52.200 --> 01:40:54.060
They did those people

3823
01:40:54.060 --> 01:40:56.760
<v 4>would have found something like fucking world of Warcraft.</v>

3824
01:40:56.910 --> 01:40:59.310
It if it wasn't drugs or alcohol would have been something.

3825
01:40:59.820 --> 01:41:01.080
<v 6>I agree with you,</v>

3826
01:41:01.081 --> 01:41:04.080
but I don't agree with you because I know people that literally,

3827
01:41:04.140 --> 01:41:05.010
whatever it is,

3828
01:41:05.011 --> 01:41:06.240
they got the bad gene.

3829
01:41:06.270 --> 01:41:07.170
They cannot drink.

3830
01:41:07.410 --> 01:41:10.470
They have one drink and they're gone and they're sober and they need to be

3831
01:41:10.471 --> 01:41:10.950
sober.

3832
01:41:10.950 --> 01:41:12.990
I know people that have a chemical issue.

3833
01:41:13.100 --> 01:41:13.381
Yeah,

3834
01:41:13.381 --> 01:41:14.040
I know.

3835
01:41:14.040 --> 01:41:18.570
I know a few and I didn't think they existed until I was in my like late

3836
01:41:18.570 --> 01:41:19.403
twenties and then I was like,

3837
01:41:19.410 --> 01:41:22.920
oh okay I think I am misreading this.

3838
01:41:23.140 --> 01:41:23.851
Because I was like,

3839
01:41:23.851 --> 01:41:24.960
oh a bunch of weak bitches.

3840
01:41:24.961 --> 01:41:28.980
Like I have this dumb approach to people who couldn't quit drugs or alcohol.

3841
01:41:29.010 --> 01:41:30.480
But usually those people,

3842
01:41:30.481 --> 01:41:32.790
I've seen them be fucked up with other things too.

3843
01:41:32.910 --> 01:41:33.390
Sure.

3844
01:41:33.390 --> 01:41:33.781
Yeah.

3845
01:41:33.781 --> 01:41:34.710
But those people,

3846
01:41:34.740 --> 01:41:39.740
they might have a psychological issue as well as this compulsive issue as well

3847
01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:42.240
as like a chemical problem.

3848
01:41:42.380 --> 01:41:45.130
Like there's a cumulative things that can happen too.

3849
01:41:45.390 --> 01:41:47.620
And for some people it's also like alcohol.

3850
01:41:47.730 --> 01:41:51.660
Alcoholism is a weird thing where it starts off where they can handle it and

3851
01:41:51.661 --> 01:41:53.640
then somewhere along the line there,

3852
01:41:53.641 --> 01:41:57.300
Bonnie just a loses its ability to tolerate alcohol.

3853
01:41:57.450 --> 01:41:58.780
And if they keep drinking,

3854
01:41:58.810 --> 01:41:59.850
keep abusing their body,

3855
01:41:59.851 --> 01:42:02.310
it's one shot and they're dawn's Ville.

3856
01:42:02.820 --> 01:42:04.080
I've seen people like that.

3857
01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:06.510
I don't think we totally understand.

3858
01:42:06.750 --> 01:42:07.111
You know,

3859
01:42:07.111 --> 01:42:10.200
like how another person is feeling when they take something.

3860
01:42:10.530 --> 01:42:10.921
You know.

3861
01:42:10.921 --> 01:42:13.410
And I think there are some people out there that can,

3862
01:42:13.620 --> 01:42:15.810
that can get hammered and they just fall apart.

3863
01:42:15.950 --> 01:42:16.390
<v 1>My friend,</v>

3864
01:42:16.390 --> 01:42:17.051
my friend Laura,

3865
01:42:17.051 --> 01:42:20.830
she just takes one hit and she of marijuana and she,

3866
01:42:20.831 --> 01:42:22.980
her body like short circuits and like,

3867
01:42:23.020 --> 01:42:26.530
I think we talked about it once where she just stood up and ran towards the Bath

3868
01:42:26.531 --> 01:42:29.080
Tub and just fluke like trip over the bathtub.

3869
01:42:29.081 --> 01:42:31.710
It flew and like almost shift every single one of her teeth out.

3870
01:42:32.020 --> 01:42:33.280
And she had no idea why she did that.

3871
01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:36.010
It was just like a body just reacted crazy.

3872
01:42:36.080 --> 01:42:36.160
<v 6>Oh,</v>

3873
01:42:36.160 --> 01:42:37.740
a friend of mine from fear factor,

3874
01:42:37.741 --> 01:42:39.750
we were all in New York filming and uh,

3875
01:42:39.780 --> 01:42:44.610
it was all the crew and we passed a joint around and she took one hit and just

3876
01:42:44.640 --> 01:42:46.680
blacked out and someone caught her.

3877
01:42:46.860 --> 01:42:49.430
Someone had a catcher in the middle of the street,

3878
01:42:49.470 --> 01:42:49.891
New York.

3879
01:42:49.891 --> 01:42:50.310
She like,

3880
01:42:50.310 --> 01:42:51.270
she almost fell,

3881
01:42:51.570 --> 01:42:53.790
she almost fell down and cracked her head off the concrete.

3882
01:42:53.820 --> 01:42:55.750
Like she just went unconscious colon.

3883
01:42:56.130 --> 01:42:59.670
Everybody else has just taken a pull off of a joint and everybody else is fine.

3884
01:42:59.880 --> 01:43:01.590
But for whatever reason it hits her.

3885
01:43:01.770 --> 01:43:02.603
And her.

3886
01:43:02.690 --> 01:43:03.261
<v 4>That's why,</v>

3887
01:43:03.261 --> 01:43:03.561
you know,

3888
01:43:03.561 --> 01:43:04.430
I've talked about it a million.

3889
01:43:04.460 --> 01:43:06.050
I've talked with you a million times about it.

3890
01:43:06.051 --> 01:43:09.770
My just [inaudible] I've had good experiences,

3891
01:43:09.771 --> 01:43:13.280
but I've had a couple that were just fucking atrocious.

3892
01:43:13.281 --> 01:43:16.310
I the anxiety level and the paranoia and the,

3893
01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:17.510
the fucking,

3894
01:43:17.540 --> 01:43:17.811
you know,

3895
01:43:17.811 --> 01:43:20.000
like I thought it was going to jump out of an airplane.

3896
01:43:20.001 --> 01:43:20.240
One

3897
01:43:20.240 --> 01:43:21.170
<v 6>sitting for everybody.</v>

3898
01:43:21.380 --> 01:43:22.110
That's fact.

3899
01:43:22.110 --> 01:43:22.730
Yeah.

3900
01:43:22.730 --> 01:43:23.660
Nothing's for everybody.

3901
01:43:23.661 --> 01:43:24.190
So I'm you.

3902
01:43:24.190 --> 01:43:25.550
You don't even drink caffeine anymore,

3903
01:43:25.551 --> 01:43:25.790
right?

3904
01:43:25.790 --> 01:43:26.061
<v 4>No.</v>

3905
01:43:26.061 --> 01:43:27.380
Cause it was all because of that.

3906
01:43:27.440 --> 01:43:30.760
The anxiety that was getting so fucking grow as it is.

3907
01:43:30.770 --> 01:43:30.911
Look,

3908
01:43:30.911 --> 01:43:31.940
I know savage,

3909
01:43:32.270 --> 01:43:34.000
you fighting with fucking people you're on.

3910
01:43:34.510 --> 01:43:35.021
You know what?

3911
01:43:35.021 --> 01:43:36.140
I want people,

3912
01:43:36.141 --> 01:43:37.760
you're an MMA fight and that chick,

3913
01:43:37.790 --> 01:43:38.361
when that chick,

3914
01:43:38.361 --> 01:43:41.420
I want to justify that because when I got in the argument with her,

3915
01:43:41.540 --> 01:43:42.410
I never once said,

3916
01:43:42.411 --> 01:43:42.901
you're a bitch.

3917
01:43:42.901 --> 01:43:43.400
You're a con.

3918
01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:44.600
I never raised my voice.

3919
01:43:44.710 --> 01:43:44.900
Right.

3920
01:43:44.900 --> 01:43:45.920
All I did was say,

3921
01:43:46.070 --> 01:43:46.341
wow,

3922
01:43:46.341 --> 01:43:46.671
your,

3923
01:43:46.671 --> 01:43:48.020
I said like I'm talking to you.

3924
01:43:48.021 --> 01:43:48.261
I went,

3925
01:43:48.261 --> 01:43:48.441
wow,

3926
01:43:48.441 --> 01:43:49.010
you're a,

3927
01:43:49.010 --> 01:43:50.390
you're a horrible person.

3928
01:43:50.810 --> 01:43:52.910
And just the way she was acting to me,

3929
01:43:53.270 --> 01:43:54.103
it was like,

3930
01:43:54.140 --> 01:43:55.490
you shouldn't get away with this.

3931
01:43:55.510 --> 01:43:55.820
I got it.

3932
01:43:55.820 --> 01:43:59.390
And that's how I was talking and I never once said she,

3933
01:43:59.450 --> 01:44:00.830
the next day they said,

3934
01:44:00.860 --> 01:44:01.430
oh,

3935
01:44:01.430 --> 01:44:03.050
you said she should be raped.

3936
01:44:03.051 --> 01:44:03.884
And you said,

3937
01:44:04.190 --> 01:44:04.971
I said no.

3938
01:44:04.971 --> 01:44:05.451
I said,

3939
01:44:05.451 --> 01:44:08.320
I hope she gets hit by a car on the way home to that.

3940
01:44:08.690 --> 01:44:10.130
<v 7>Just say she's a horrible person.</v>

3941
01:44:10.190 --> 01:44:10.321
<v 4>No,</v>

3942
01:44:10.321 --> 01:44:10.441
no,

3943
01:44:10.441 --> 01:44:10.610
no,

3944
01:44:10.610 --> 01:44:10.920
no,

3945
01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:11.121
no.

3946
01:44:11.121 --> 01:44:12.980
But I was combating the high road.

3947
01:44:12.981 --> 01:44:15.560
She said some things to me that I said that then,

3948
01:44:15.710 --> 01:44:16.820
but what I say to you,

3949
01:44:17.140 --> 01:44:17.330
hey,

3950
01:44:17.330 --> 01:44:17.571
you know,

3951
01:44:17.571 --> 01:44:18.260
she was just,

3952
01:44:18.260 --> 01:44:19.230
<v 7>she will fuck about this story.</v>

3953
01:44:19.231 --> 01:44:19.910
How about that?

3954
01:44:19.910 --> 01:44:20.743
She was just being account.

3955
01:44:21.840 --> 01:44:24.030
Thank you know.

3956
01:44:24.090 --> 01:44:24.660
I mean,

3957
01:44:24.660 --> 01:44:25.440
you know what it is,

3958
01:44:25.440 --> 01:44:26.460
but I know I just,

3959
01:44:26.461 --> 01:44:27.810
I want to justify that.

3960
01:44:28.110 --> 01:44:28.680
Ah,

3961
01:44:28.680 --> 01:44:29.640
I forgot what I was talking about.

3962
01:44:29.700 --> 01:44:30.480
It's no big deal.

3963
01:44:30.480 --> 01:44:31.200
I know what you're saying.

3964
01:44:31.200 --> 01:44:32.033
You're not on coke,

3965
01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:34.590
but caffeine is a little too much for your personality.

3966
01:44:34.591 --> 01:44:35.670
I'm not aggressive.

3967
01:44:36.660 --> 01:44:37.070
Yeah,

3968
01:44:37.070 --> 01:44:38.100
you're not aggressive.

3969
01:44:38.101 --> 01:44:40.380
But if someone's a douchey person to you,

3970
01:44:40.410 --> 01:44:41.580
you don't walk away from it.

3971
01:44:41.590 --> 01:44:42.180
Right.

3972
01:44:42.180 --> 01:44:43.050
That's right.

3973
01:44:43.080 --> 01:44:44.880
That's what a lot of a lot of times,

3974
01:44:44.881 --> 01:44:46.170
like what's that old expression?

3975
01:44:47.610 --> 01:44:49.470
If you're in an argument with an idiot,

3976
01:44:49.500 --> 01:44:50.360
it's very difficult to,

3977
01:44:50.361 --> 01:44:51.060
so who's who?

3978
01:44:51.060 --> 01:44:51.570
Yeah.

3979
01:44:51.570 --> 01:44:52.080
You know,

3980
01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:54.780
I think that I probably fucked up that in paraphrasing it,

3981
01:44:54.781 --> 01:44:58.800
but that is a situation where if you're in a situation where someone's

3982
01:44:58.801 --> 01:45:01.770
aggressive to you and you're aggressive back to them and then someone walks in

3983
01:45:01.771 --> 01:45:02.460
on it,

3984
01:45:02.460 --> 01:45:05.700
it looks like you're always in fights and he could be a guy that just defend

3985
01:45:05.701 --> 01:45:06.451
yourself all the time,

3986
01:45:06.451 --> 01:45:07.830
but it looks like you're always on fights.

3987
01:45:07.840 --> 01:45:08.673
Yeah.

3988
01:45:08.700 --> 01:45:10.710
Especially if there's youtube clips of it where there's smoke,

3989
01:45:10.711 --> 01:45:12.210
there's fire and uh,

3990
01:45:12.211 --> 01:45:12.840
you know,

3991
01:45:12.840 --> 01:45:13.141
yeah.

3992
01:45:13.141 --> 01:45:13.470
I mean,

3993
01:45:13.470 --> 01:45:14.850
I've always felt like,

3994
01:45:14.880 --> 01:45:15.230
um,

3995
01:45:15.230 --> 01:45:15.520
I've,

3996
01:45:15.520 --> 01:45:18.150
I've never been one to start shit with people.

3997
01:45:18.151 --> 01:45:19.500
I don't like starting shit with people,

3998
01:45:19.830 --> 01:45:24.830
but I also not really enjoy people like getting off on me and like saying shitty

3999
01:45:24.871 --> 01:45:26.310
things to me just because they want,

4000
01:45:26.430 --> 01:45:27.540
they want to be cunty.

4001
01:45:27.660 --> 01:45:31.950
So when you stand your ground or when you're aggro back or it's salting back,

4002
01:45:32.430 --> 01:45:33.690
it becomes the same thing.

4003
01:45:33.691 --> 01:45:33.991
You just,

4004
01:45:33.991 --> 01:45:34.711
they started it,

4005
01:45:34.711 --> 01:45:35.490
but you're doing it,

4006
01:45:35.490 --> 01:45:35.761
you know,

4007
01:45:35.761 --> 01:45:35.970
you're,

4008
01:45:35.970 --> 01:45:37.080
you're both involved in it.

4009
01:45:37.081 --> 01:45:37.320
Yeah.

4010
01:45:37.320 --> 01:45:38.310
And it's really stupid,

4011
01:45:38.311 --> 01:45:40.890
but it takes a long time to realize that it's really stupid.

4012
01:45:41.450 --> 01:45:42.840
And you know what I did?

4013
01:45:42.841 --> 01:45:46.370
The first thing I did when these guys came African was cops and then I had to

4014
01:45:46.371 --> 01:45:47.340
have cops and I was like,

4015
01:45:47.910 --> 01:45:48.331
all right,

4016
01:45:48.331 --> 01:45:49.260
I gotta you know?

4017
01:45:49.350 --> 01:45:50.670
Well those guys were working too,

4018
01:45:50.671 --> 01:45:51.810
so they weren't even fucked up.

4019
01:45:51.870 --> 01:45:52.950
They were just on the,

4020
01:45:52.951 --> 01:45:53.521
on that sweet,

4021
01:45:53.521 --> 01:45:54.170
sweet pussy.

4022
01:45:54.170 --> 01:45:55.650
I think they were pretty fucked up though.

4023
01:45:55.651 --> 01:45:57.540
You think so while they were working?

4024
01:45:57.840 --> 01:45:58.800
I think it was one of those.

4025
01:45:58.890 --> 01:45:59.581
Oh,

4026
01:45:59.581 --> 01:46:00.030
okay.

4027
01:46:00.030 --> 01:46:02.010
Well I bet they just in love with that girl,

4028
01:46:02.011 --> 01:46:02.281
man.

4029
01:46:02.281 --> 01:46:03.091
That's so common.

4030
01:46:03.091 --> 01:46:06.450
It's so common where you get one pretty girl just dominates like a business

4031
01:46:06.451 --> 01:46:07.284
establishment.

4032
01:46:07.410 --> 01:46:08.221
That's the saddest thing.

4033
01:46:08.221 --> 01:46:11.670
When you go to visit a buddy at work and you realize that this is one hot chick

4034
01:46:11.671 --> 01:46:15.450
that sort of like putting our spray around the room and all these totes that

4035
01:46:15.451 --> 01:46:18.750
your buddy works with at tripping over themselves trying to please his girl and

4036
01:46:18.900 --> 01:46:21.210
white knighting it at every turn and you know,

4037
01:46:21.211 --> 01:46:23.730
I think you're just out of line with the way he talk around women.

4038
01:46:23.940 --> 01:46:24.151
You know,

4039
01:46:24.151 --> 01:46:25.850
you know those cock suckers and like,

4040
01:46:25.890 --> 01:46:27.420
oh you son of a bitch.

4041
01:46:27.660 --> 01:46:28.710
Look what you're doing here.

4042
01:46:28.711 --> 01:46:30.120
You're throwing yourself on the sword.

4043
01:46:30.870 --> 01:46:32.420
<v 4>Sad sack of shit.</v>

4044
01:46:32.421 --> 01:46:32.700
You,

4045
01:46:32.700 --> 01:46:35.100
well that's what I say when the guy that when he finally calmed down,

4046
01:46:35.101 --> 01:46:35.934
I said to the guy,

4047
01:46:36.180 --> 01:46:36.511
he said,

4048
01:46:36.511 --> 01:46:38.310
you've got a girl in there crying right now.

4049
01:46:38.311 --> 01:46:38.731
And I said,

4050
01:46:38.731 --> 01:46:39.240
hold on.

4051
01:46:39.240 --> 01:46:40.073
I said,

4052
01:46:40.380 --> 01:46:44.190
I explained what happened to him and he kind of looked at me like,

4053
01:46:44.340 --> 01:46:44.581
oh,

4054
01:46:44.581 --> 01:46:46.620
this is a different story than what she told me.

4055
01:46:48.270 --> 01:46:50.190
Check the wants to get you to fight

4056
01:46:50.190 --> 01:46:51.230
<v 7>someone for two,</v>

4057
01:46:51.500 --> 01:46:54.470
but who does that kind of setting?

4058
01:46:54.520 --> 01:46:55.800
You have guts.

4059
01:46:56.670 --> 01:46:58.110
You couldn't get me to do that.

4060
01:46:58.140 --> 01:46:58.650
Any girl.

4061
01:46:58.650 --> 01:46:58.861
Yeah.

4062
01:46:58.861 --> 01:46:59.310
He said,

4063
01:46:59.310 --> 01:46:59.780
I'd be like,

4064
01:46:59.780 --> 01:46:59.950
look,

4065
01:46:59.950 --> 01:47:01.650
you're going to have to deal with this yourself.

4066
01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:02.950
Yeah.

4067
01:47:02.950 --> 01:47:03.121
Well,

4068
01:47:03.121 --> 01:47:05.040
there's a lot of guys out there.

4069
01:47:05.330 --> 01:47:06.600
You can't get any pussy.

4070
01:47:06.750 --> 01:47:08.220
It's hard confusing.

4071
01:47:08.221 --> 01:47:10.110
It's fuck if you're a dude out there,

4072
01:47:10.111 --> 01:47:10.770
okay,

4073
01:47:10.770 --> 01:47:15.090
and get an attractive guy and you're working at a fucking kitchen and a bar,

4074
01:47:15.330 --> 01:47:15.541
you know,

4075
01:47:15.541 --> 01:47:16.440
you flipping Burgers,

4076
01:47:16.441 --> 01:47:17.280
no one wants to fuck you.

4077
01:47:17.310 --> 01:47:17.611
All right?

4078
01:47:17.611 --> 01:47:18.444
That's just a fact.

4079
01:47:18.690 --> 01:47:19.970
And you know that no one wants to fuck you in.

4080
01:47:19.971 --> 01:47:24.360
That shit gets depressing and you're willing to play the long game and befriend

4081
01:47:24.361 --> 01:47:27.870
a lot of really [inaudible] hoping that when they're 40 and it all falls apart

4082
01:47:27.871 --> 01:47:28.351
for them.

4083
01:47:28.351 --> 01:47:30.810
They'll go with the guy who actually really loved them once they get over this

4084
01:47:30.811 --> 01:47:32.400
looks thing or or whatever.

4085
01:47:32.550 --> 01:47:34.800
And so there's a lot of poor saps out there.

4086
01:47:34.801 --> 01:47:35.820
They get sucked into,

4087
01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:41.000
which essentially a deal with a drug dealer that never gives you the drugs.

4088
01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:42.421
It's like,

4089
01:47:42.421 --> 01:47:42.631
man,

4090
01:47:42.631 --> 01:47:43.710
I got that cold king,

4091
01:47:43.711 --> 01:47:44.341
but dog,

4092
01:47:44.341 --> 01:47:45.510
I can't give you none.

4093
01:47:45.800 --> 01:47:46.261
I come on,

4094
01:47:46.261 --> 01:47:46.861
I love you.

4095
01:47:46.861 --> 01:47:47.491
I love you.

4096
01:47:47.491 --> 01:47:48.031
I love you.

4097
01:47:48.031 --> 01:47:48.864
I love you.

4098
01:47:48.990 --> 01:47:51.060
I just want it to be your cocaine dog.

4099
01:47:51.120 --> 01:47:51.721
I don't know.

4100
01:47:51.721 --> 01:47:52.590
I'm vulnerable,

4101
01:47:53.070 --> 01:47:53.401
you know?

4102
01:47:53.401 --> 01:47:56.940
I just feel like maybe you only want me for my cocaine and I would like us to

4103
01:47:56.941 --> 01:47:57.751
just be friends.

4104
01:47:57.751 --> 01:47:58.140
You know?

4105
01:47:58.140 --> 01:48:00.690
Can't you just understand that I have this cocaine and I want to,

4106
01:48:00.691 --> 01:48:01.530
I want to keep it,

4107
01:48:02.240 --> 01:48:02.820
you know?

4108
01:48:02.820 --> 01:48:04.230
But I heard you gave Billy cocaine,

4109
01:48:04.231 --> 01:48:04.441
you know,

4110
01:48:04.441 --> 01:48:07.080
I was very vulnerable and I don't want to make that mistake again.

4111
01:48:07.081 --> 01:48:08.490
And now me and Billy don't talk.

4112
01:48:08.620 --> 01:48:11.460
And I want that to happen between us because we're good friends.

4113
01:48:11.580 --> 01:48:12.900
So I can't give you this cocaine.

4114
01:48:13.140 --> 01:48:16.440
So these poor pussy junkies will follow her around for years.

4115
01:48:16.460 --> 01:48:17.700
Or are you doing another show over there?

4116
01:48:18.570 --> 01:48:19.401
Fucking bugged us.

4117
01:48:19.401 --> 01:48:20.234
Attacked me.

4118
01:48:20.970 --> 01:48:24.000
So you're doing this for years and years and you know,

4119
01:48:24.010 --> 01:48:26.400
you do drastic shit like trying to fight people in parking lots,

4120
01:48:27.380 --> 01:48:28.213
you know,

4121
01:48:28.310 --> 01:48:28.680
it's not,

4122
01:48:28.680 --> 01:48:33.680
it's fucked up that sex is like such a priority that requires legal mail bot

4123
01:48:34.050 --> 01:48:35.370
prostitution was legal.

4124
01:48:35.371 --> 01:48:37.680
I think it would take such an edge off of,

4125
01:48:37.681 --> 01:48:39.690
we have a fucked up attitude about prostitution.

4126
01:48:39.691 --> 01:48:39.841
Like,

4127
01:48:39.841 --> 01:48:41.100
I don't want anybody,

4128
01:48:41.101 --> 01:48:42.090
I know it'd be a prostitute,

4129
01:48:42.120 --> 01:48:42.640
meaning either,

4130
01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:43.800
and I don't want to,

4131
01:48:43.830 --> 01:48:44.720
I don't partake in it.

4132
01:48:44.721 --> 01:48:45.600
It's not my thing.

4133
01:48:45.780 --> 01:48:48.000
But there's a lot of guys that I,

4134
01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:49.560
friends of mine that I'm like,

4135
01:48:49.561 --> 01:48:51.390
let me take you to a hooker.

4136
01:48:51.420 --> 01:48:55.440
When I was going to say is I also don't want any friend of mine to be a janitor

4137
01:48:55.480 --> 01:48:56.490
to have clean toilets.

4138
01:48:56.820 --> 01:48:57.780
That job sucks too.

4139
01:48:58.140 --> 01:48:58.350
You know?

4140
01:48:58.350 --> 01:48:59.520
I don't know which one's better.

4141
01:48:59.690 --> 01:48:59.941
You know?

4142
01:48:59.941 --> 01:49:03.300
I don't know if you're like really open minded with sex and there's a screening

4143
01:49:03.301 --> 01:49:05.130
process and the guys who come through a polite,

4144
01:49:05.310 --> 01:49:06.720
I really don't know which one is worse.

4145
01:49:06.960 --> 01:49:09.810
Cleaning toilets or letting the guy put a condom on you.

4146
01:49:09.900 --> 01:49:10.740
Ooh,

4147
01:49:10.770 --> 01:49:11.603
on top of you.

4148
01:49:11.790 --> 01:49:12.360
I Dunno.

4149
01:49:12.360 --> 01:49:12.780
I Dunno.

4150
01:49:12.780 --> 01:49:12.991
I mean,

4151
01:49:12.991 --> 01:49:14.970
it's really a cultural decision.

4152
01:49:15.120 --> 01:49:16.320
It's a personal decision,

4153
01:49:16.680 --> 01:49:18.720
but I think you should be able to make that decision yourself.

4154
01:49:18.850 --> 01:49:19.130
You know,

4155
01:49:19.130 --> 01:49:22.560
I wouldn't want anybody that I'm friends with deciding to be a coroner.

4156
01:49:22.830 --> 01:49:23.610
I really wouldn't.

4157
01:49:23.610 --> 01:49:24.600
I wouldn't want you to do that.

4158
01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:26.820
But if you want to do that,

4159
01:49:26.821 --> 01:49:28.020
I think it should be your choice.

4160
01:49:28.050 --> 01:49:30.480
I always wanted to know craziness,

4161
01:49:30.481 --> 01:49:30.751
man.

4162
01:49:30.751 --> 01:49:31.920
You're looking at bodies all day.

4163
01:49:31.980 --> 01:49:32.611
She's telling you to do it.

4164
01:49:32.611 --> 01:49:33.540
It was a funeral director.

4165
01:49:33.540 --> 01:49:35.180
He was the bartender at this comedy club and he,

4166
01:49:35.190 --> 01:49:36.023
he uh,

4167
01:49:36.050 --> 01:49:36.400
yeah,

4168
01:49:36.400 --> 01:49:38.310
he used to be a funeral director up north in Boston.

4169
01:49:38.640 --> 01:49:39.473
And I was like,

4170
01:49:39.830 --> 01:49:40.663
wow.

4171
01:49:41.550 --> 01:49:44.250
How were you able to fucking do that every day?

4172
01:49:44.330 --> 01:49:45.163
Just,

4173
01:49:45.360 --> 01:49:45.631
yeah.

4174
01:49:45.631 --> 01:49:45.811
Well,

4175
01:49:45.811 --> 01:49:50.150
how about guys who get caught the corpses there doesn't happen that often.

4176
01:49:50.330 --> 01:49:53.090
But you know what Gun Jing is a buddy of mine badging,

4177
01:49:53.120 --> 01:49:54.770
a buddy of mine back in Boston,

4178
01:49:55.070 --> 01:49:55.431
they,

4179
01:49:55.431 --> 01:50:00.431
him and his brother walked in on this guy who had just gotten done fucking one

4180
01:50:01.611 --> 01:50:02.444
of the corpses.

4181
01:50:02.750 --> 01:50:03.111
He,

4182
01:50:03.111 --> 01:50:04.550
he's almost positive.

4183
01:50:04.700 --> 01:50:05.211
He's like,

4184
01:50:05.211 --> 01:50:09.320
there was a dead naked girl on the counter and this guy was huffing and puffing

4185
01:50:09.321 --> 01:50:12.890
and sweating and he was back there with his dead naked girl.

4186
01:50:13.010 --> 01:50:15.890
And they heard something funny and they knock them.

4187
01:50:15.891 --> 01:50:19.640
They were there because someone in their family had died and they had,

4188
01:50:19.680 --> 01:50:19.940
you know,

4189
01:50:19.940 --> 01:50:23.180
go through the funeral arrangements and that he believes,

4190
01:50:23.181 --> 01:50:28.181
they just about stumbled upon a guy who had fucked a dead female corpse.

4191
01:50:29.180 --> 01:50:30.140
He's almost positive,

4192
01:50:30.141 --> 01:50:30.351
right?

4193
01:50:30.351 --> 01:50:31.100
And you've got to know,

4194
01:50:31.100 --> 01:50:32.420
this is like a really conservative,

4195
01:50:32.421 --> 01:50:37.220
duly some dark hole of the Internet where you've seen these people find them

4196
01:50:37.221 --> 01:50:37.371
though.

4197
01:50:37.371 --> 01:50:38.204
But I'm saying,

4198
01:50:38.480 --> 01:50:39.890
what do you mean there's videos?

4199
01:50:40.090 --> 01:50:42.140
There's videos and guys fucking dead bodies.

4200
01:50:42.350 --> 01:50:42.951
It's like video.

4201
01:50:42.951 --> 01:50:44.450
The guy put on line,

4202
01:50:44.600 --> 01:50:48.980
it was him and his boyfriend and he killed his boyfriend and then he like fucked

4203
01:50:48.981 --> 01:50:51.710
him and cut him up and put it all on line eight,

4204
01:50:51.711 --> 01:50:52.670
some of his body.

4205
01:50:54.020 --> 01:50:55.340
What did you just show up?

4206
01:50:55.440 --> 01:51:00.330
<v 1>Judging is an act that where you take a person that's been buried recently and</v>

4207
01:51:00.331 --> 01:51:03.480
you t you get him out from under the ground and you,

4208
01:51:03.710 --> 01:51:04.070
uh,

4209
01:51:04.070 --> 01:51:08.350
like put your lips around their vagina and you have somebody else like,

4210
01:51:08.540 --> 01:51:10.530
like jump up and down on their stomach.

4211
01:51:11.220 --> 01:51:11.760
Wait a minute.

4212
01:51:11.760 --> 01:51:14.070
<v 7>And whereby the first person to ejaculate,</v>

4213
01:51:14.071 --> 01:51:18.960
ms places lips over the dead person's sexual parts while his fellow competitors

4214
01:51:18.961 --> 01:51:20.010
jump on the stomach.

4215
01:51:20.040 --> 01:51:20.970
This is just made up,

4216
01:51:21.030 --> 01:51:21.780
but that's made up.

4217
01:51:21.780 --> 01:51:22.620
That's totally made up.

4218
01:51:22.650 --> 01:51:23.483
That's so stupid.

4219
01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:23.791
God,

4220
01:51:23.791 --> 01:51:24.360
Jane,

4221
01:51:24.360 --> 01:51:25.061
what did you make the,

4222
01:51:25.061 --> 01:51:28.830
I have a feeling Brian did ain't go to knock a tiny about that.

4223
01:51:29.010 --> 01:51:29.843
That's real.

4224
01:51:29.940 --> 01:51:30.091
Well,

4225
01:51:30.091 --> 01:51:30.930
I guess it isn't real.

4226
01:51:30.931 --> 01:51:32.490
If you decided to real Yoshi,

4227
01:51:32.980 --> 01:51:33.900
you would know about it.

4228
01:51:33.930 --> 01:51:34.611
What is a,

4229
01:51:34.611 --> 01:51:34.871
you know,

4230
01:51:34.871 --> 01:51:36.240
what's a Cleveland Steamer?

4231
01:51:36.580 --> 01:51:38.130
You know what's a dirty Sanchez?

4232
01:51:38.160 --> 01:51:39.020
You know what it is.

4233
01:51:39.030 --> 01:51:39.863
So it's real.

4234
01:51:40.050 --> 01:51:40.920
Once you invented,

4235
01:51:40.921 --> 01:51:41.670
it's like a drink.

4236
01:51:41.670 --> 01:51:42.600
It's like a bloody Mary.

4237
01:51:42.770 --> 01:51:43.603
We can say we tried,

4238
01:51:43.620 --> 01:51:47.520
we tried to any one of those up on there and again I think no on urban

4239
01:51:47.521 --> 01:51:49.080
dictionary and it was uh,

4240
01:51:49.620 --> 01:51:50.670
it was already there.

4241
01:51:52.880 --> 01:51:53.340
I don't know.

4242
01:51:53.340 --> 01:51:54.920
It was something like we were trying to make the,

4243
01:51:54.940 --> 01:51:57.690
the Amish butter churner or something and we were saying like,

4244
01:51:57.691 --> 01:51:58.820
you take a Dildo and you,

4245
01:51:59.260 --> 01:51:59.700
you,

4246
01:51:59.700 --> 01:52:03.960
you come all over it and then fuck the girl with the calm of the Dildo and then,

4247
01:52:04.220 --> 01:52:04.430
uh,

4248
01:52:04.430 --> 01:52:07.950
are you fucker in your ass while she's upside down like a butter churn or

4249
01:52:07.951 --> 01:52:08.490
something.

4250
01:52:08.490 --> 01:52:09.211
And I swear to God,

4251
01:52:09.211 --> 01:52:09.751
we like put it on,

4252
01:52:09.751 --> 01:52:11.310
there was something like very simple.

4253
01:52:11.820 --> 01:52:15.450
I'm sure it's probably every depraved sexual act ever.

4254
01:52:15.451 --> 01:52:16.530
It's probably been labeled.

4255
01:52:16.531 --> 01:52:19.710
There's tee shirts for sale as a TM behind it.

4256
01:52:20.680 --> 01:52:25.100
<v 1>I used said I made a move when I was in college and I used to call it the dom</v>

4257
01:52:25.101 --> 01:52:26.000
Pablo cause it was a girl.

4258
01:52:26.001 --> 01:52:28.640
I fucked that Don Pablos where you would take the girl,

4259
01:52:28.641 --> 01:52:31.790
she'll be on her stomach and you'd like lay down.

4260
01:52:31.791 --> 01:52:33.140
So you're kind of like butt to butt,

4261
01:52:33.440 --> 01:52:35.810
but you put your Dick in her like between your legs.

4262
01:52:35.811 --> 01:52:39.740
So you're like pushing it like that and then you fall down so you're on top of

4263
01:52:39.741 --> 01:52:40.760
her and you're using her legs.

4264
01:52:40.761 --> 01:52:45.440
I lost five seconds ago but it hit the g spot like crazy and she just,

4265
01:52:45.500 --> 01:52:46.040
that's all she

4266
01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:47.830
<v 4>wanted after Pablo.</v>

4267
01:52:47.860 --> 01:52:49.910
And then I tried it to somebody else and they're like,

4268
01:52:49.911 --> 01:52:50.481
fuck that.

4269
01:52:50.481 --> 01:52:51.560
What the hell you doing?

4270
01:52:51.561 --> 01:52:53.830
Just get on top of me having to make sense.

4271
01:52:54.320 --> 01:52:56.810
<v 6>Girls don't while you're practicing shit and we've already done before,</v>

4272
01:52:56.811 --> 01:52:58.310
Hey I've done this one a bunch of times.

4273
01:52:58.311 --> 01:52:59.400
Try this lay down five.

4274
01:52:59.410 --> 01:52:59.631
They're like,

4275
01:52:59.631 --> 01:52:59.871
what?

4276
01:52:59.871 --> 01:53:00.111
Wait,

4277
01:53:00.111 --> 01:53:00.944
what are you doing?

4278
01:53:01.480 --> 01:53:02.091
God Damn what?

4279
01:53:02.091 --> 01:53:02.421
You're silly.

4280
01:53:02.421 --> 01:53:05.330
Fuck Brian fucks the same way he does a podcast just interrupts.

4281
01:53:05.331 --> 01:53:05.420
Yeah,

4282
01:53:05.420 --> 01:53:06.810
<v 4>it's a weird shit and has a little bit,</v>

4283
01:53:07.650 --> 01:53:08.483
we get a sense,

4284
01:53:08.580 --> 01:53:09.413
hold on.

4285
01:53:09.440 --> 01:53:10.160
Open your mouth.

4286
01:53:10.160 --> 01:53:10.881
Put a toe in it.

4287
01:53:10.881 --> 01:53:12.650
Know who fought to be funny.

4288
01:53:15.070 --> 01:53:18.470
This girl at that we know down in Australia said she,

4289
01:53:18.471 --> 01:53:20.730
she told my friend that she woke up one night,

4290
01:53:20.731 --> 01:53:22.490
she hooked up with the state and she wakes up.

4291
01:53:22.700 --> 01:53:24.500
He's standing over a jerking off.

4292
01:53:24.510 --> 01:53:24.950
Whoa.

4293
01:53:24.950 --> 01:53:27.410
And he's got his toe in her pussy.

4294
01:53:27.650 --> 01:53:29.090
Oh my God.

4295
01:53:29.091 --> 01:53:29.924
How rude.

4296
01:53:30.260 --> 01:53:31.160
That guy's an asshole.

4297
01:53:31.161 --> 01:53:32.480
He's out there walking around.

4298
01:53:32.481 --> 01:53:34.250
Once you catch him on the floor and stuff,

4299
01:53:34.640 --> 01:53:35.301
he's stuffing it.

4300
01:53:35.301 --> 01:53:36.380
Write up some chick's pussy,

4301
01:53:36.390 --> 01:53:36.940
Sushi.

4302
01:53:36.940 --> 01:53:40.940
Very least hubs like some alcohol wipes and really do a good job of cleaning

4303
01:53:40.941 --> 01:53:41.621
your toe off.

4304
01:53:41.621 --> 01:53:43.220
We shove it in some chicks clam.

4305
01:53:43.610 --> 01:53:44.720
That's just rude.

4306
01:53:45.020 --> 01:53:45.853
That guy's a dick.

4307
01:53:46.090 --> 01:53:47.610
Do you know what I've always wanted?

4308
01:53:47.710 --> 01:53:48.770
I've always wanted to try.

4309
01:53:49.850 --> 01:53:53.510
Have you seen those pills that they sell like at cvs and then referred Toi kids

4310
01:53:53.511 --> 01:53:56.450
where they're like these little pills and he put them in a glass of water and

4311
01:53:56.451 --> 01:53:58.730
they make this humongous like dinosaurs or something.

4312
01:53:58.880 --> 01:54:01.130
I've always wanted to put it in one of those girls' vaginas and see what

4313
01:54:01.131 --> 01:54:01.411
happens.

4314
01:54:01.411 --> 01:54:03.290
It's kind of like a tampon called they die.

4315
01:54:03.920 --> 01:54:06.230
You ever heard of a thing called toxic shock syndrome?

4316
01:54:07.090 --> 01:54:07.923
Girls

4317
01:54:08.040 --> 01:54:11.430
<v 6>things up their pussy when they find things that are stuffed in their pussy and</v>

4318
01:54:11.431 --> 01:54:11.581
they,

4319
01:54:11.581 --> 01:54:12.510
there've been up there for a while.

4320
01:54:12.511 --> 01:54:14.160
Like sometimes they can get really sick.

4321
01:54:14.550 --> 01:54:16.390
I girls like the girls have

4322
01:54:16.440 --> 01:54:16.800
<v 4>die.</v>

4323
01:54:16.800 --> 01:54:16.930
Yeah.

4324
01:54:16.930 --> 01:54:18.590
But stuck up their posting.

4325
01:54:18.610 --> 01:54:20.280
I mean like if you're going to nerf their pussy,

4326
01:54:20.310 --> 01:54:23.460
like you don't keep it in there for like half a chunk of it in there.

4327
01:54:23.810 --> 01:54:26.490
Like would blow up really big in the gut when those fuckers like a fucking

4328
01:54:26.491 --> 01:54:27.680
muppet coming out of my vagina.

4329
01:54:27.681 --> 01:54:30.570
So you needed practice this in a lab before you stick it in the grill.

4330
01:54:31.120 --> 01:54:34.500
I just heard a story about a guy who was fucking a girl and uh,

4331
01:54:35.100 --> 01:54:37.890
found like while he was fucking going down on or something,

4332
01:54:37.900 --> 01:54:40.050
found a condom that was in her pussy.

4333
01:54:40.110 --> 01:54:41.370
Oh my Jesus.

4334
01:54:42.780 --> 01:54:43.170
<v 6>Well,</v>

4335
01:54:43.170 --> 01:54:45.580
I was a girl that I was dating where she had a,

4336
01:54:45.810 --> 01:54:50.730
her Tampon I had broken off like in the middle and she pulled part of it out but

4337
01:54:50.731 --> 01:54:54.450
part of it was like stuffed in her pussy and I like put my finger in her and I'm

4338
01:54:54.451 --> 01:54:54.661
like,

4339
01:54:54.661 --> 01:54:55.460
what the fuck is it?

4340
01:54:55.460 --> 01:54:56.271
And I pulled it out like,

4341
01:54:56.271 --> 01:54:57.750
and you have a 10 piece of Tampon in your pussy.

4342
01:54:58.100 --> 01:55:00.090
And she was so embarrassed.

4343
01:55:00.091 --> 01:55:01.110
She was so,

4344
01:55:01.111 --> 01:55:01.731
so embarrassed.

4345
01:55:01.731 --> 01:55:04.470
Like she was like almost in tears and I was like,

4346
01:55:04.740 --> 01:55:05.573
it's just a mistake.

4347
01:55:05.670 --> 01:55:06.960
Like I know you have a Tampon.

4348
01:55:06.961 --> 01:55:07.980
I didn't understand it.

4349
01:55:07.981 --> 01:55:09.950
Like being a guy you don't understand.

4350
01:55:09.951 --> 01:55:11.700
Like how could that bother you?

4351
01:55:12.010 --> 01:55:13.920
Like I know that you have tampons,

4352
01:55:13.921 --> 01:55:15.270
you tell me when you're on your period.

4353
01:55:15.271 --> 01:55:15.840
I,

4354
01:55:15.840 --> 01:55:17.460
I don't understand why this would be an issue,

4355
01:55:17.700 --> 01:55:19.320
but to her it was like this huge,

4356
01:55:19.530 --> 01:55:19.771
like,

4357
01:55:19.771 --> 01:55:20.551
embarrassment.

4358
01:55:20.551 --> 01:55:20.910
I'm like,

4359
01:55:20.910 --> 01:55:21.743
I don't,

4360
01:55:21.810 --> 01:55:23.500
<v 4>what did the girls a girly thing,</v>

4361
01:55:23.501 --> 01:55:23.780
right.

4362
01:55:23.780 --> 01:55:24.613
This girl I dated,

4363
01:55:24.670 --> 01:55:29.210
like we were drunk and I fucked one of his little baby micro tampons into her

4364
01:55:29.500 --> 01:55:32.600
and then she didn't know about it and then a couple of days later she was

4365
01:55:32.601 --> 01:55:35.360
getting kind of sick and it puts you to smell.

4366
01:55:35.361 --> 01:55:36.320
It was like a balloon pond.

4367
01:55:36.350 --> 01:55:36.501
No,

4368
01:55:36.501 --> 01:55:37.400
I had to dig it out.

4369
01:55:38.240 --> 01:55:39.073
I had to dig it out.

4370
01:55:39.700 --> 01:55:40.000
Yeah,

4371
01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:40.560
I to do it.

4372
01:55:40.560 --> 01:55:41.393
Have to.

4373
01:55:41.540 --> 01:55:42.220
Yeah.

4374
01:55:42.220 --> 01:55:44.340
You know when you're young and you're so horny,

4375
01:55:44.341 --> 01:55:44.731
it's like,

4376
01:55:44.731 --> 01:55:45.031
she's like,

4377
01:55:45.031 --> 01:55:45.721
I'm on my period.

4378
01:55:45.721 --> 01:55:46.070
We shouldn't,

4379
01:55:46.070 --> 01:55:46.370
you know,

4380
01:55:46.370 --> 01:55:47.350
you rub it on the outside.

4381
01:55:49.410 --> 01:55:52.890
Any little thing you can do and they can't fish that string outs,

4382
01:55:52.950 --> 01:55:55.050
stuffed it in there like a fucking Muskett.

4383
01:55:57.270 --> 01:55:59.130
It's like you packed around in there.

4384
01:55:59.440 --> 01:56:00.850
Then you've got to play a gynecologist.

4385
01:56:01.430 --> 01:56:02.001
<v 5>I've been there,</v>

4386
01:56:02.001 --> 01:56:02.700
but our man,

4387
01:56:02.700 --> 01:56:02.940
you're like,

4388
01:56:02.940 --> 01:56:03.201
hold on,

4389
01:56:03.201 --> 01:56:05.920
this rubbing on the outside and you hear those words coming out of your mouth.

4390
01:56:05.930 --> 01:56:06.080
Like,

4391
01:56:06.080 --> 01:56:08.120
am I really that retarded that I just said that?

4392
01:56:09.600 --> 01:56:10.970
Let me just rub it on the outside.

4393
01:56:11.420 --> 01:56:11.700
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

4394
01:56:11.700 --> 01:56:12.010
We've,

4395
01:56:12.010 --> 01:56:13.160
we've all said that.

4396
01:56:13.190 --> 01:56:14.440
Everyone said I've done,

4397
01:56:14.570 --> 01:56:15.291
he'll say it every week.

4398
01:56:15.291 --> 01:56:15.920
Let me just,

4399
01:56:15.920 --> 01:56:17.780
let me just put it in for a second.

4400
01:56:18.830 --> 01:56:19.850
If you like it,

4401
01:56:19.851 --> 01:56:21.330
it can stay right here.

4402
01:56:21.950 --> 01:56:22.640
Don't,

4403
01:56:22.640 --> 01:56:23.030
right.

4404
01:56:23.030 --> 01:56:24.110
We can take it out.

4405
01:56:24.140 --> 01:56:26.810
Let's sleep with it inside just to see what it would feel like.

4406
01:56:27.240 --> 01:56:27.951
If you want to move,

4407
01:56:27.951 --> 01:56:28.340
that's fine.

4408
01:56:28.340 --> 01:56:29.960
The most disappointing thing is when a girl says,

4409
01:56:29.961 --> 01:56:30.351
okay,

4410
01:56:30.351 --> 01:56:30.680
and you're like,

4411
01:56:30.680 --> 01:56:30.821
oh,

4412
01:56:30.821 --> 01:56:30.880
well,

4413
01:56:30.880 --> 01:56:32.390
she's just as fucking stupid as awesome.

4414
01:56:33.260 --> 01:56:35.750
You're supposed to be the one who sent a bill here.

4415
01:56:35.751 --> 01:56:37.310
He's supposed to post out of this predicament.

4416
01:56:37.340 --> 01:56:41.540
It took me a long time to realize that if you just go when you're trying to hook

4417
01:56:41.541 --> 01:56:42.830
up with a girl and you go fun,

4418
01:56:42.920 --> 01:56:44.270
I don't want him and you go to sleep,

4419
01:56:44.630 --> 01:56:46.040
all of a sudden they wake you up.

4420
01:56:46.070 --> 01:56:46.341
They'll like,

4421
01:56:46.341 --> 01:56:46.611
come on,

4422
01:56:46.611 --> 01:56:47.181
let's fuck,

4423
01:56:47.181 --> 01:56:47.930
and really?

4424
01:56:47.930 --> 01:56:48.141
Yeah,

4425
01:56:48.141 --> 01:56:48.801
I found that.

4426
01:56:48.801 --> 01:56:50.150
That ridiculous.

4427
01:56:50.151 --> 01:56:51.650
That means your game sucks.

4428
01:56:51.800 --> 01:56:52.011
No,

4429
01:56:52.011 --> 01:56:52.161
no,

4430
01:56:52.161 --> 01:56:52.281
no,

4431
01:56:52.281 --> 01:56:52.880
no,

4432
01:56:52.880 --> 01:56:53.360
no.

4433
01:56:53.360 --> 01:56:54.740
Hear me out forever.

4434
01:56:54.741 --> 01:56:55.011
I was,

4435
01:56:55.011 --> 01:56:56.150
the one girl was like,

4436
01:56:56.151 --> 01:56:56.331
wait,

4437
01:56:56.331 --> 01:56:57.111
and they'd go to sleep.

4438
01:56:57.111 --> 01:56:57.261
No,

4439
01:56:57.261 --> 01:56:57.411
no,

4440
01:56:57.411 --> 01:56:57.651
no.

4441
01:56:57.651 --> 01:56:58.341
Forever.

4442
01:56:58.341 --> 01:56:58.941
I was the guy.

4443
01:56:58.941 --> 01:56:59.980
I would try every,

4444
01:57:00.260 --> 01:57:03.770
I would keep them up for eight hours until they'd finally give in.

4445
01:57:03.771 --> 01:57:04.340
Like,

4446
01:57:04.340 --> 01:57:04.880
listen,

4447
01:57:04.880 --> 01:57:06.020
why don't we do this?

4448
01:57:06.021 --> 01:57:07.070
And then we'll try this.

4449
01:57:07.071 --> 01:57:08.750
And then we would ask them with words.

4450
01:57:08.780 --> 01:57:08.971
No,

4451
01:57:08.971 --> 01:57:09.471
I mean just,

4452
01:57:09.471 --> 01:57:09.681
you know,

4453
01:57:09.681 --> 01:57:11.000
while you're fully right.

4454
01:57:11.090 --> 01:57:12.790
So then I found out,

4455
01:57:12.791 --> 01:57:12.890
yeah,

4456
01:57:12.890 --> 01:57:13.680
<v 5>that if you just,</v>

4457
01:57:13.680 --> 01:57:14.130
if you,

4458
01:57:14.130 --> 01:57:17.400
if you kind of do what they do and you kind of play hard to get,

4459
01:57:17.401 --> 01:57:18.234
they go,

4460
01:57:18.300 --> 01:57:19.560
what's this kind of rejecting me?

4461
01:57:20.040 --> 01:57:21.090
And then all of a sudden they're like,

4462
01:57:21.091 --> 01:57:24.660
let's fuck Eddie f working some long game on these chicks.

4463
01:57:25.070 --> 01:57:25.410
I just,

4464
01:57:25.410 --> 01:57:27.240
how long would it take before you figured that out?

4465
01:57:27.360 --> 01:57:28.230
I took a year.

4466
01:57:28.310 --> 01:57:29.143
Here's my,

4467
01:57:29.230 --> 01:57:30.210
here's my advice to you,

4468
01:57:30.211 --> 01:57:31.044
my friend.

4469
01:57:31.080 --> 01:57:32.670
Just fuck girls who actually want to fuck you.

4470
01:57:33.240 --> 01:57:33.990
And when they don't,

4471
01:57:33.990 --> 01:57:35.010
if they don't do like,

4472
01:57:35.011 --> 01:57:35.640
that's cool.

4473
01:57:35.640 --> 01:57:36.090
Yeah.

4474
01:57:36.090 --> 01:57:37.200
So it's just uh,

4475
01:57:37.201 --> 01:57:37.590
greeted,

4476
01:57:37.590 --> 01:57:39.090
not be framing while we all went through puberty.

4477
01:57:39.110 --> 01:57:39.660
Yeah.

4478
01:57:39.660 --> 01:57:40.493
We've all been there.

4479
01:57:40.500 --> 01:57:41.280
It's all good.

4480
01:57:41.280 --> 01:57:42.120
Just you go over there.

4481
01:57:42.121 --> 01:57:42.810
I'll go over here.

4482
01:57:42.810 --> 01:57:42.911
Oh,

4483
01:57:42.911 --> 01:57:43.350
cool.

4484
01:57:43.350 --> 01:57:45.390
Well now cause there's some girls getting married.

4485
01:57:45.391 --> 01:57:46.850
I get one for the rest of my life.

4486
01:57:47.430 --> 01:57:49.320
There's some gals would like you at the gift.

4487
01:57:49.580 --> 01:57:50.690
I go about finding them.

4488
01:57:50.720 --> 01:57:51.420
Found that one.

4489
01:57:51.420 --> 01:57:54.900
It's like finding your audience and comedy you don't want to do,

4490
01:57:54.901 --> 01:57:57.510
like Brian was talking about doing some shows this weekend is a bunch of old

4491
01:57:57.511 --> 01:57:59.750
people in the audience and you know that's a,

4492
01:57:59.760 --> 01:58:01.680
that's uncomfortable feeling when it's not your audience.

4493
01:58:01.710 --> 01:58:02.543
It's awful.

4494
01:58:02.700 --> 01:58:03.533
It's terrible.

4495
01:58:03.720 --> 01:58:04.440
It's awful.

4496
01:58:04.440 --> 01:58:04.650
Jeff,

4497
01:58:04.650 --> 01:58:05.483
find your audience.

4498
01:58:05.510 --> 01:58:09.720
It is once those people who didn't live with the Internet and once they die off,

4499
01:58:09.960 --> 01:58:11.010
we're going to have a different world.

4500
01:58:11.490 --> 01:58:12.191
You're lucky Jay,

4501
01:58:12.191 --> 01:58:15.780
you're one of the few comedians though that gets to purely performed for your

4502
01:58:15.781 --> 01:58:16.614
audience.

4503
01:58:16.830 --> 01:58:17.350
Um,

4504
01:58:17.350 --> 01:58:17.541
Yah,

4505
01:58:17.541 --> 01:58:18.420
this is quite a few now.

4506
01:58:18.421 --> 01:58:20.970
I think more now than I think ever before because of the Internet.

4507
01:58:22.550 --> 01:58:23.370
I don't think so.

4508
01:58:23.370 --> 01:58:23.671
No.

4509
01:58:23.671 --> 01:58:24.750
I think we all still have to,

4510
01:58:24.751 --> 01:58:26.550
like in Australia I performed for my audience.

4511
01:58:26.551 --> 01:58:28.950
People come to me there in the crowd.

4512
01:58:28.951 --> 01:58:29.581
They're always,

4513
01:58:29.581 --> 01:58:31.560
they bought a ticket to see me and that feels good.

4514
01:58:32.070 --> 01:58:32.903
In Australia.

4515
01:58:33.210 --> 01:58:34.043
In America,

4516
01:58:34.380 --> 01:58:35.490
I'm still doing gigs.

4517
01:58:35.520 --> 01:58:36.570
How many comedy clubs?

4518
01:58:36.780 --> 01:58:37.500
Every once one.

4519
01:58:37.500 --> 01:58:38.280
I've still had it.

4520
01:58:38.280 --> 01:58:39.960
I had it in the past two years,

4521
01:58:40.590 --> 01:58:42.030
two or three times where I've had

4522
01:58:42.120 --> 01:58:44.070
<v 4>the club owners tell me,</v>

4523
01:58:44.790 --> 01:58:45.450
hey,

4524
01:58:45.450 --> 01:58:46.320
I know you do this,

4525
01:58:46.321 --> 01:58:46.501
blah,

4526
01:58:46.501 --> 01:58:47.011
blah blah,

4527
01:58:47.011 --> 01:58:47.844
and I've gone,

4528
01:58:48.060 --> 01:58:48.780
ah,

4529
01:58:48.780 --> 01:58:49.620
I'm in the car.

4530
01:58:49.740 --> 01:58:50.131
And they're like,

4531
01:58:50.131 --> 01:58:50.370
what?

4532
01:58:50.370 --> 01:58:51.480
They're like and I'm like,

4533
01:58:51.481 --> 01:58:52.650
don't tell me how to do my act.

4534
01:58:52.651 --> 01:58:53.610
I'm on my way home.

4535
01:58:53.850 --> 01:58:54.420
And they're like,

4536
01:58:54.420 --> 01:58:55.230
what do you mean?

4537
01:58:55.230 --> 01:58:58.860
I've had three club owners in the last two years.

4538
01:58:59.160 --> 01:58:59.993
Tell me,

4539
01:59:00.760 --> 01:59:00.990
uh,

4540
01:59:00.990 --> 01:59:04.080
you're too edgy and you're too offensive onstage and you're going to have to

4541
01:59:04.081 --> 01:59:05.340
calm it down for the next show.

4542
01:59:05.520 --> 01:59:06.271
And like,

4543
01:59:06.271 --> 01:59:08.100
they'll call me in my room and I'm like,

4544
01:59:08.370 --> 01:59:09.000
I'm in the car,

4545
01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:09.930
I'm in the taxi,

4546
01:59:09.980 --> 01:59:11.310
I'm on my way to the airport.

4547
01:59:11.700 --> 01:59:12.533
And they're like,

4548
01:59:13.040 --> 01:59:13.410
what?

4549
01:59:13.410 --> 01:59:13.590
What?

4550
01:59:13.590 --> 01:59:13.921
I'm like,

4551
01:59:13.921 --> 01:59:14.754
fuck you.

4552
01:59:14.760 --> 01:59:15.360
You don't tell me

4553
01:59:15.360 --> 01:59:15.841
<v 7>do my act.</v>

4554
01:59:15.841 --> 01:59:16.591
We need to go on tour.

4555
01:59:16.591 --> 01:59:16.930
Man,

4556
01:59:16.930 --> 01:59:18.270
that just happened to me this weekend,

4557
01:59:18.300 --> 01:59:20.460
five minutes before I went on stage and he's like,

4558
01:59:20.580 --> 01:59:21.780
I need you to do a clean set.

4559
01:59:21.781 --> 01:59:22.320
And I was like,

4560
01:59:22.320 --> 01:59:24.990
I don't have any leave at that point cause it really,

4561
01:59:25.050 --> 01:59:25.620
I've,

4562
01:59:25.620 --> 01:59:27.120
I've stayed and,

4563
01:59:27.210 --> 01:59:29.700
and they all end up apologizing.

4564
01:59:29.701 --> 01:59:33.090
And they try to keep you because they've got like one time it happened here in

4565
01:59:33.091 --> 01:59:34.320
La and I just sold out crowd.

4566
01:59:34.390 --> 01:59:34.891
You can't,

4567
01:59:34.891 --> 01:59:37.140
you can't tell a guy not to do is act.

4568
01:59:37.170 --> 01:59:38.490
If you don't like that act,

4569
01:59:38.491 --> 01:59:39.900
you cannot hire them again.

4570
01:59:40.110 --> 01:59:41.950
But there's no way you could tell him how to do it.

4571
01:59:42.140 --> 01:59:44.220
So that's why I go fuck off and I just leave.

4572
01:59:44.850 --> 01:59:45.270
Yeah.

4573
01:59:45.270 --> 01:59:46.020
It's just,

4574
01:59:46.020 --> 01:59:47.100
you can say you,

4575
01:59:47.101 --> 01:59:47.970
I don't think you're funny.

4576
01:59:47.971 --> 01:59:48.751
You can fire them.

4577
01:59:48.751 --> 01:59:51.030
You could ask for another comic to come in and replace him.

4578
01:59:51.210 --> 01:59:53.730
But if you're gonna allow him to go on stage,

4579
01:59:53.760 --> 01:59:54.750
you're not a producer.

4580
01:59:55.020 --> 01:59:56.970
You have no say in what goes on.

4581
01:59:57.010 --> 01:59:58.050
You know that guy.

4582
01:59:58.051 --> 01:59:58.800
It's his act.

4583
01:59:58.800 --> 02:00:01.020
If you don't want to hire them again because you don't like it,

4584
02:00:01.021 --> 02:00:01.860
that's all cool.

4585
02:00:02.040 --> 02:00:03.550
But you can't direct a fuck.

4586
02:00:03.600 --> 02:00:04.350
I got it.

4587
02:00:04.350 --> 02:00:05.150
I got it in the air

4588
02:00:05.150 --> 02:00:05.400
<v 4>part.</v>

4589
02:00:05.400 --> 02:00:07.320
I'm on the airport on the way to a show and,

4590
02:00:07.470 --> 02:00:08.670
and the woman called me and said,

4591
02:00:08.671 --> 02:00:08.881
hey,

4592
02:00:08.881 --> 02:00:09.451
you got to go,

4593
02:00:09.451 --> 02:00:09.810
uh,

4594
02:00:09.810 --> 02:00:10.643
tonight.

4595
02:00:10.650 --> 02:00:10.981
Listen,

4596
02:00:10.981 --> 02:00:12.210
I need you to corporate clean.

4597
02:00:12.300 --> 02:00:12.810
And I said,

4598
02:00:12.810 --> 02:00:13.643
what?

4599
02:00:13.710 --> 02:00:13.981
She goes,

4600
02:00:13.981 --> 02:00:14.700
I need your corporate club,

4601
02:00:14.700 --> 02:00:15.360
we have a bunch of,

4602
02:00:15.360 --> 02:00:15.771
you know,

4603
02:00:15.771 --> 02:00:15.870
uh,

4604
02:00:15.870 --> 02:00:16.740
Christmas parties in.

4605
02:00:16.741 --> 02:00:17.574
And I said,

4606
02:00:17.910 --> 02:00:19.140
I know when I got booked,

4607
02:00:19.141 --> 02:00:20.460
I got booked to do my show.

4608
02:00:20.880 --> 02:00:21.570
And she said,

4609
02:00:21.570 --> 02:00:21.781
yeah,

4610
02:00:21.781 --> 02:00:23.970
but tonight's all Christmas parties.

4611
02:00:23.971 --> 02:00:24.541
And I said,

4612
02:00:24.541 --> 02:00:26.100
well that's not,

4613
02:00:26.101 --> 02:00:26.491
and she goes,

4614
02:00:26.491 --> 02:00:26.731
well,

4615
02:00:26.731 --> 02:00:28.290
we're going to have to dock your pay then.

4616
02:00:28.620 --> 02:00:29.453
And I went,

4617
02:00:29.730 --> 02:00:29.941
no,

4618
02:00:29.941 --> 02:00:30.151
no,

4619
02:00:30.151 --> 02:00:31.680
you're going to have to pay me what

4620
02:00:31.680 --> 02:00:33.540
<v 7>I was contracted to be paid.</v>

4621
02:00:33.660 --> 02:00:37.270
We're going to have to dock your pay because you won't change your act from my

4622
02:00:37.360 --> 02:00:38.190
yes.

4623
02:00:38.190 --> 02:00:39.023
And I said,

4624
02:00:39.240 --> 02:00:39.871
fuck you.

4625
02:00:39.871 --> 02:00:41.040
They treat you like you're a waitress.

4626
02:00:41.041 --> 02:00:41.760
That's what it is.

4627
02:00:41.760 --> 02:00:45.150
And I still wear my apron with my logo on it or you're fired.

4628
02:00:45.180 --> 02:00:46.770
But too many comics say,

4629
02:00:46.830 --> 02:00:47.663
okay,

4630
02:00:47.880 --> 02:00:49.200
I go fuck off.

4631
02:00:49.230 --> 02:00:50.063
And I leave.

4632
02:00:50.520 --> 02:00:51.180
And uh,

4633
02:00:51.180 --> 02:00:52.470
I think if more comics did that,

4634
02:00:52.471 --> 02:00:54.090
they wouldn't do that to the can't,

4635
02:00:54.150 --> 02:00:54.721
you know,

4636
02:00:54.721 --> 02:00:55.710
they need the money.

4637
02:00:55.711 --> 02:00:55.951
I mean,

4638
02:00:55.951 --> 02:00:59.430
I remember clearly days when I was told that I had to clean it up when I was

4639
02:00:59.431 --> 02:00:59.970
coming up.

4640
02:00:59.970 --> 02:01:01.040
It just happened all the time.

4641
02:01:01.130 --> 02:01:03.330
But if you suck it up just once,

4642
02:01:03.780 --> 02:01:05.460
if every comic sucked it up once,

4643
02:01:05.461 --> 02:01:06.570
no club owner would ever do it.

4644
02:01:06.600 --> 02:01:06.961
Yeah.

4645
02:01:06.961 --> 02:01:10.410
But they would because the god could still find someone to replace you and

4646
02:01:10.411 --> 02:01:11.400
they'd probably be cleaner,

4647
02:01:11.490 --> 02:01:12.220
you know.

4648
02:01:12.220 --> 02:01:15.900
So that was one of the big things about being unoffensive when you first started

4649
02:01:15.901 --> 02:01:19.440
out you'd get so much more work because when you first start out you're,

4650
02:01:19.441 --> 02:01:20.550
you're opening for people.

4651
02:01:20.551 --> 02:01:24.690
And the last thing someone wants to do is go on after some guy who breaks all

4652
02:01:24.691 --> 02:01:25.524
these taboos.

4653
02:01:25.530 --> 02:01:30.330
Especially if you break the same taboos or if your act as clean.

4654
02:01:30.690 --> 02:01:30.991
You know,

4655
02:01:30.991 --> 02:01:34.490
if there's a two things because one like the guy's already like doing the kind

4656
02:01:34.491 --> 02:01:39.260
of material that like a headliner does or this particular headline does and have

4657
02:01:39.261 --> 02:01:40.700
your clean and you have to follow.

4658
02:01:40.701 --> 02:01:44.240
Some guy I was talking about fishing tampons out of checks and you know,

4659
02:01:44.420 --> 02:01:47.780
a lot of times they'll fucking headliners or blow gaskets.

4660
02:01:47.810 --> 02:01:48.290
Yeah.

4661
02:01:48.290 --> 02:01:49.700
I've seen more,

4662
02:01:50.210 --> 02:01:54.060
more censorship from headliners in comedy clubs and,

4663
02:01:54.061 --> 02:01:56.660
and including guys who are not big names.

4664
02:01:56.661 --> 02:02:01.100
They just happened to be the guy last and it was just like you say like for the

4665
02:02:01.101 --> 02:02:02.480
most part when you go to a comedy club,

4666
02:02:02.481 --> 02:02:04.280
if you see a guy who was an unknown name,

4667
02:02:04.490 --> 02:02:06.170
he's not an unknown name just to you.

4668
02:02:06.320 --> 02:02:07.730
He's an unknown name period.

4669
02:02:07.820 --> 02:02:09.470
So when he's headlined in these clubs,

4670
02:02:09.590 --> 02:02:13.100
people are coming to see the show because they've been comped like to get free

4671
02:02:13.101 --> 02:02:13.611
tickets,

4672
02:02:13.611 --> 02:02:18.200
it's an off night or you know I'm the guy goes on the radio and drums up some

4673
02:02:18.201 --> 02:02:21.770
business and they have contests and they give away some tickets and then they

4674
02:02:21.771 --> 02:02:23.570
make the money off the alcohol and that's,

4675
02:02:23.600 --> 02:02:25.670
that's a common thing and those guys,

4676
02:02:25.671 --> 02:02:27.290
I've seen those guys that,

4677
02:02:27.370 --> 02:02:29.540
those are like low level dudes usually.

4678
02:02:29.720 --> 02:02:32.960
Probably a little struggle a little bit every now and then anyway,

4679
02:02:33.200 --> 02:02:35.340
they'll change a guy's act if a guy's a middle.

4680
02:02:35.350 --> 02:02:35.510
That,

4681
02:02:35.510 --> 02:02:36.830
I've heard stories and I've had,

4682
02:02:36.860 --> 02:02:39.230
I've had a couple of guys give me when I was coming up,

4683
02:02:39.530 --> 02:02:40.131
don't do this,

4684
02:02:40.131 --> 02:02:40.521
they'll do that.

4685
02:02:40.521 --> 02:02:41.360
Not many,

4686
02:02:41.630 --> 02:02:43.380
but I've heard more stories about guys go.

4687
02:02:43.381 --> 02:02:48.381
I have never once said to anybody that opens for me don't do that or I've never,

4688
02:02:49.060 --> 02:02:51.980
and it always annoyed me when I heard guys did it.

4689
02:02:52.040 --> 02:02:52.760
It's gross.

4690
02:02:52.760 --> 02:02:53.410
It's disgusting.

4691
02:02:53.410 --> 02:02:55.280
Like you less the guy stealing.

4692
02:02:55.490 --> 02:02:55.850
Sure,

4693
02:02:55.850 --> 02:02:56.150
sure.

4694
02:02:56.150 --> 02:02:58.580
Or if he's stepping on your shit and there are,

4695
02:02:58.581 --> 02:03:02.360
those are two instances that happen all the time and w what I mean by stepping

4696
02:03:02.361 --> 02:03:02.841
on your shit.

4697
02:03:02.841 --> 02:03:04.070
If folks who don't know stand up,

4698
02:03:04.250 --> 02:03:07.850
like say if Eddie if to had a joke about going to Jamba juice and it was like a

4699
02:03:07.851 --> 02:03:09.920
signature bit about going to Jamba juice.

4700
02:03:10.280 --> 02:03:12.530
I might if I want to fuck with them.

4701
02:03:12.531 --> 02:03:13.520
If I was the Middle Act,

4702
02:03:13.521 --> 02:03:17.630
I might go on stage and just make up my own joke about geometries that I wasn't

4703
02:03:17.631 --> 02:03:18.710
doing the night before.

4704
02:03:18.950 --> 02:03:19.950
But I'll do it in,

4705
02:03:19.951 --> 02:03:20.700
in and I'll,

4706
02:03:20.700 --> 02:03:21.950
it'll be clearly like,

4707
02:03:21.980 --> 02:03:23.570
like I just slapped it together.

4708
02:03:23.720 --> 02:03:27.080
But what I'm doing is trying to take the wind out of the sails of his Jamba

4709
02:03:27.081 --> 02:03:30.410
juice joke by already trampling on that subject.

4710
02:03:30.411 --> 02:03:32.840
It's a common thing that comics will do.

4711
02:03:33.260 --> 02:03:35.230
What I do get it every once a while.

4712
02:03:35.231 --> 02:03:39.680
We'll get mad about is somebody deliberately blowing the light and offensively

4713
02:03:39.681 --> 02:03:40.580
blowing it like,

4714
02:03:40.910 --> 02:03:41.840
like not just,

4715
02:03:41.920 --> 02:03:42.200
you know,

4716
02:03:42.200 --> 02:03:46.580
they're supposed to do 30 minutes and they ended up doing 45 especially because

4717
02:03:46.581 --> 02:03:48.320
you have two shows and you have to close.

4718
02:03:48.560 --> 02:03:48.820
I'll,

4719
02:03:48.820 --> 02:03:50.660
I'll get mad about that.

4720
02:03:51.230 --> 02:03:52.970
But it also has to be,

4721
02:03:53.120 --> 02:03:54.470
it's not five minutes over,

4722
02:03:54.471 --> 02:03:56.450
it's when they go 10 or 20 minutes over,

4723
02:03:56.840 --> 02:03:59.900
I want to tear their face off like a chimpanzee does.

4724
02:04:00.030 --> 02:04:00.560
I?

4725
02:04:00.560 --> 02:04:02.840
Well that's rude and that's why people think you're on coke.

4726
02:04:04.250 --> 02:04:06.530
Just say it and I don't act like a monocoque and you're like,

4727
02:04:06.570 --> 02:04:06.860
uh,

4728
02:04:06.860 --> 02:04:08.870
someone is talking for an extra five minutes,

4729
02:04:09.580 --> 02:04:12.170
25 minutes.

4730
02:04:12.171 --> 02:04:15.410
They get to saturate the comedies in exaggeration.

4731
02:04:15.420 --> 02:04:15.690
So

4732
02:04:15.690 --> 02:04:19.460
<v 1>this this week and I had to do a 15 minute at that.</v>

4733
02:04:19.650 --> 02:04:20.490
That was clean.

4734
02:04:20.610 --> 02:04:23.550
And so I would like replace words and stuff like throwing calm.

4735
02:04:23.551 --> 02:04:23.641
I'd,

4736
02:04:23.641 --> 02:04:28.290
it's like throwing hot dogs and I made it silly and goofy and I also did a lot

4737
02:04:28.291 --> 02:04:29.180
of just what I call it,

4738
02:04:29.181 --> 02:04:29.971
math jokes,

4739
02:04:29.971 --> 02:04:31.290
which is just like this happens,

4740
02:04:31.291 --> 02:04:31.870
this happens.

4741
02:04:31.870 --> 02:04:32.840
That's why that happens.

4742
02:04:32.841 --> 02:04:33.220
It's kind of,

4743
02:04:33.220 --> 02:04:33.350
you know,

4744
02:04:33.350 --> 02:04:33.890
like,

4745
02:04:33.890 --> 02:04:35.910
like dumb shit fucking worked.

4746
02:04:35.911 --> 02:04:36.480
And I was like,

4747
02:04:36.480 --> 02:04:37.200
this is,

4748
02:04:37.200 --> 02:04:38.070
this is the dumbest Shit

4749
02:04:38.070 --> 02:04:40.050
<v 7>I've ever seen in my life and you guys are loving.</v>

4750
02:04:40.080 --> 02:04:40.913
This is stupid.

4751
02:04:41.410 --> 02:04:42.243
That's silly.

4752
02:04:42.450 --> 02:04:42.901
You should,

4753
02:04:42.901 --> 02:04:44.070
you should just enjoy it.

4754
02:04:44.130 --> 02:04:44.491
You know,

4755
02:04:44.491 --> 02:04:45.450
you shouldn't get upset.

4756
02:04:45.480 --> 02:04:45.870
Your,

4757
02:04:45.870 --> 02:04:46.920
your issue right now,

4758
02:04:46.921 --> 02:04:47.281
Brian,

4759
02:04:47.281 --> 02:04:47.431
is,

4760
02:04:47.431 --> 02:04:48.211
we talked about this before,

4761
02:04:48.211 --> 02:04:49.830
the show is that he's,

4762
02:04:49.860 --> 02:04:52.500
he's like known and a lot of places,

4763
02:04:52.800 --> 02:04:55.380
but you don't do that many shows for people that don't know you.

4764
02:04:55.530 --> 02:04:56.460
So people know you,

4765
02:04:56.461 --> 02:04:56.871
they know you.

4766
02:04:56.871 --> 02:04:59.910
It's silly bitch and you're ridiculous and you're always buying boner pills.

4767
02:05:00.030 --> 02:05:02.190
So they want to hear this ridiculous shit out of you.

4768
02:05:02.340 --> 02:05:03.870
But for people who don't know you,

4769
02:05:04.020 --> 02:05:04.381
they're like,

4770
02:05:04.381 --> 02:05:06.420
why is this guy talking about coming on the ceiling?

4771
02:05:06.450 --> 02:05:06.720
Like,

4772
02:05:06.720 --> 02:05:07.553
you know,

4773
02:05:07.740 --> 02:05:09.270
what the fuck are you saying?

4774
02:05:09.300 --> 02:05:09.810
You know what I mean?

4775
02:05:09.810 --> 02:05:10.480
It's like that's,

4776
02:05:10.480 --> 02:05:10.820
that's a,

4777
02:05:10.820 --> 02:05:11.910
that's a tough combination.

4778
02:05:11.911 --> 02:05:12.744
And it's also,

4779
02:05:12.990 --> 02:05:13.201
you know,

4780
02:05:13.201 --> 02:05:13.500
you,

4781
02:05:13.500 --> 02:05:17.490
you know this very well that you can fall into when you're always performing for

4782
02:05:17.491 --> 02:05:18.324
your crowd.

4783
02:05:18.720 --> 02:05:19.530
It gets easy.

4784
02:05:19.530 --> 02:05:19.881
Oh yeah,

4785
02:05:19.881 --> 02:05:20.070
yeah.

4786
02:05:20.070 --> 02:05:23.340
You can get soft and you got to throw yourself into these situations where

4787
02:05:23.341 --> 02:05:24.430
nobody knows you.

4788
02:05:24.431 --> 02:05:28.380
If you watched any bunny like recently that like disappointed the fuck out of

4789
02:05:28.381 --> 02:05:28.680
you.

4790
02:05:28.680 --> 02:05:28.951
Yeah.

4791
02:05:28.951 --> 02:05:29.580
And I can't say,

4792
02:05:29.580 --> 02:05:31.260
I can't say who either saw,

4793
02:05:31.500 --> 02:05:31.771
oh,

4794
02:05:31.771 --> 02:05:32.390
it was brutal.

4795
02:05:32.390 --> 02:05:36.300
I mean me and Diaz left 15 minutes into this dude set.

4796
02:05:36.490 --> 02:05:39.390
Like the laziest thing I'd ever seen.

4797
02:05:39.480 --> 02:05:40.820
It's a lot of that shit down,

4798
02:05:40.830 --> 02:05:41.663
man.

4799
02:05:41.730 --> 02:05:42.563
I,

4800
02:05:43.650 --> 02:05:48.300
I almost wanted to as a friend tell him that you can't do this.

4801
02:05:48.720 --> 02:05:50.370
There's a lot of people like that though.

4802
02:05:50.430 --> 02:05:50.701
You know,

4803
02:05:50.701 --> 02:05:50.941
I've,

4804
02:05:50.941 --> 02:05:51.774
I've,

4805
02:05:52.410 --> 02:05:56.160
I've always tried to do my very best to give a great show.

4806
02:05:56.190 --> 02:06:00.870
Like I want to do the best to give the best at whatever I got at that point and

4807
02:06:00.871 --> 02:06:02.820
I'll have better shows and war shows.

4808
02:06:02.821 --> 02:06:06.000
But I'm always trying my best always.

4809
02:06:06.060 --> 02:06:07.500
And when I see someone that's like,

4810
02:06:07.560 --> 02:06:09.330
it's just sending it in her phone again.

4811
02:06:09.600 --> 02:06:10.400
I'm like,

4812
02:06:10.400 --> 02:06:10.620
and,

4813
02:06:10.620 --> 02:06:10.890
and,

4814
02:06:10.890 --> 02:06:13.740
and especially if they're doing it and they doing it because they already have a

4815
02:06:13.741 --> 02:06:14.461
devoted audience.

4816
02:06:14.461 --> 02:06:14.671
I'm like,

4817
02:06:14.671 --> 02:06:18.780
do you understand what an amazing position you're lucky on your healthy eating

4818
02:06:18.781 --> 02:06:19.110
them.

4819
02:06:19.110 --> 02:06:19.291
Like,

4820
02:06:19.291 --> 02:06:20.071
did you see what you saw?

4821
02:06:20.071 --> 02:06:21.180
The crazy cat William Shit.

4822
02:06:21.240 --> 02:06:22.890
Whereas obviously there's an issue there.

4823
02:06:22.891 --> 02:06:23.730
I don't know what the fuck it is,

4824
02:06:24.060 --> 02:06:25.590
but do you know how many people,

4825
02:06:25.650 --> 02:06:26.430
I mean me,

4826
02:06:26.430 --> 02:06:27.330
huge cat flames,

4827
02:06:27.331 --> 02:06:27.660
sweat,

4828
02:06:27.660 --> 02:06:28.493
Katt Williams fan.

4829
02:06:28.890 --> 02:06:32.370
I would be so sad if I went to see him and that that went down,

4830
02:06:32.770 --> 02:06:33.150
you know,

4831
02:06:33.150 --> 02:06:35.520
when he yells or someone in the audience and then leaves and that's his whole

4832
02:06:35.521 --> 02:06:39.300
set because I remember his fucking specials where I thought the guy was

4833
02:06:39.301 --> 02:06:39.721
brilliant.

4834
02:06:39.721 --> 02:06:40.770
I'm like so fun.

4835
02:06:40.890 --> 02:06:41.940
So fun to watch.

4836
02:06:42.210 --> 02:06:42.660
You know,

4837
02:06:42.660 --> 02:06:43.380
I,

4838
02:06:43.380 --> 02:06:45.870
I will never forget what it's like to be a fan.

4839
02:06:45.900 --> 02:06:50.040
I think it's the most important thing in order to still keep your zest for

4840
02:06:50.041 --> 02:06:50.461
comedy.

4841
02:06:50.461 --> 02:06:52.020
It's just still remain a fan of it.

4842
02:06:52.080 --> 02:06:53.310
And also the struggle,

4843
02:06:53.340 --> 02:06:56.800
like I struggled for so long and that it's,

4844
02:06:56.820 --> 02:06:58.020
you're still struggling in America.

4845
02:06:58.070 --> 02:07:02.790
It started to happen for me really quickly and I'm glad it didn't because I

4846
02:07:02.791 --> 02:07:05.780
would have been one of those assholes probably that just phone it.

4847
02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:09.150
But what happened was they struggled for so long that now I value it so much

4848
02:07:09.151 --> 02:07:09.720
more.

4849
02:07:09.720 --> 02:07:09.991
You have it,

4850
02:07:09.991 --> 02:07:11.130
you're a hard worker anyway.

4851
02:07:11.160 --> 02:07:14.460
I mean you're into crossfit and you're always exercising.

4852
02:07:14.461 --> 02:07:15.041
You're always you.

4853
02:07:15.041 --> 02:07:16.290
You put forth a lot of energy.

4854
02:07:16.291 --> 02:07:17.350
You're not like a lazy guy.

4855
02:07:17.351 --> 02:07:18.330
It doesn't get shit done.

4856
02:07:18.600 --> 02:07:20.640
You just fucked up and you've got famous in Australia.

4857
02:07:21.140 --> 02:07:21.490
Yeah,

4858
02:07:21.490 --> 02:07:22.110
it's probably,

4859
02:07:22.110 --> 02:07:24.580
well Colin Quinn said to me one time I was,

4860
02:07:24.660 --> 02:07:27.960
I was taking a cab from like the seller uptown to the comic strip or something

4861
02:07:28.200 --> 02:07:31.620
and I shared a cab with Collin and it was after Saturday night live and he had

4862
02:07:31.621 --> 02:07:33.000
done all this stuff and I like calling.

4863
02:07:33.510 --> 02:07:34.410
What are you doing?

4864
02:07:34.411 --> 02:07:34.591
You know,

4865
02:07:34.591 --> 02:07:36.370
like we're all young kids flying

4866
02:07:36.370 --> 02:07:37.470
<v 5>around to the clubs and calm.</v>

4867
02:07:37.510 --> 02:07:38.620
It's like a generation,

4868
02:07:38.621 --> 02:07:40.030
like couple of generations older.

4869
02:07:40.031 --> 02:07:40.271
I'm like,

4870
02:07:40.271 --> 02:07:41.530
what are you doing with us?

4871
02:07:41.710 --> 02:07:42.550
Why are you doing this?

4872
02:07:42.551 --> 02:07:43.384
And he's like,

4873
02:07:43.510 --> 02:07:43.901
he's like,

4874
02:07:43.901 --> 02:07:47.830
cause every time I see one of you little fuckers on stage doing a good joke,

4875
02:07:48.460 --> 02:07:49.300
I think I got it.

4876
02:07:49.301 --> 02:07:50.230
I got to write one better.

4877
02:07:50.320 --> 02:07:51.153
I have to.

4878
02:07:51.190 --> 02:07:52.160
And it's,

4879
02:07:52.330 --> 02:07:54.310
I think it's compulsive among us.

4880
02:07:54.460 --> 02:07:55.840
When I see a comic killing it,

4881
02:07:56.110 --> 02:07:56.740
I'm like,

4882
02:07:56.740 --> 02:07:57.850
I got to call them and write jokes.

4883
02:07:57.851 --> 02:08:00.940
You know what else makes me want to write jokes when I see someone eating it,

4884
02:08:01.600 --> 02:08:05.380
I to see someone bombing and lesson to a comedy central radio.

4885
02:08:05.381 --> 02:08:07.630
Today on Sirius Xm,

4886
02:08:07.950 --> 02:08:08.260
you know,

4887
02:08:08.260 --> 02:08:12.310
Sirius Xm was a bunch of different channels and a my main car for a long time,

4888
02:08:12.311 --> 02:08:15.490
I have not had satellite radio and I've just been listening to the podcast,

4889
02:08:15.670 --> 02:08:17.650
but I was in a truck today.

4890
02:08:17.920 --> 02:08:19.030
And so as I'm driving around,

4891
02:08:19.031 --> 02:08:21.880
I'm listening to all this standup and it was terrible.

4892
02:08:21.881 --> 02:08:25.030
After terrible after terrible after terrible.

4893
02:08:25.220 --> 02:08:27.040
And I couldn't wait to go home and write.

4894
02:08:27.110 --> 02:08:27.461
I'm like,

4895
02:08:27.461 --> 02:08:31.510
this is just if I ever wanted to sell was a closing bit that a guy did.

4896
02:08:31.750 --> 02:08:33.250
And after the bit ended,

4897
02:08:33.370 --> 02:08:33.611
you know,

4898
02:08:33.611 --> 02:08:33.881
it's like,

4899
02:08:33.881 --> 02:08:34.361
thank you.

4900
02:08:34.361 --> 02:08:34.750
Good night.

4901
02:08:34.750 --> 02:08:35.021
I was like,

4902
02:08:35.021 --> 02:08:35.860
you gotta be fucking,

4903
02:08:36.060 --> 02:08:37.000
oh like that was your clothes.

4904
02:08:37.450 --> 02:08:41.260
This is the laziest piece of Shit I've ever heard in my life.

4905
02:08:41.261 --> 02:08:42.460
There's like zero thought.

4906
02:08:42.461 --> 02:08:46.660
People that don't know why you tried to put your best like your strongest bit

4907
02:08:46.661 --> 02:08:48.340
last and uh,

4908
02:08:48.550 --> 02:08:50.740
so that when you hear thank you,

4909
02:08:50.741 --> 02:08:51.180
good night,

4910
02:08:51.180 --> 02:08:52.120
you're like that shouldn't,

4911
02:08:52.300 --> 02:08:54.760
that shouldn't be the second joke hunk of Shit.

4912
02:08:54.940 --> 02:08:56.200
It was such a hunk of shit.

4913
02:08:56.201 --> 02:08:57.110
But I went to,

4914
02:08:57.160 --> 02:08:59.620
I went in there one day to Sirius Xm to,

4915
02:08:59.630 --> 02:09:01.660
to host some show and I said,

4916
02:09:01.661 --> 02:09:02.560
who's in charge here?

4917
02:09:02.980 --> 02:09:06.820
And they have programming that the comedy and they were really cool about it.

4918
02:09:06.821 --> 02:09:10.180
I sat down with them and I went through all my bits that they play and I said,

4919
02:09:10.181 --> 02:09:11.680
don't play that one anymore.

4920
02:09:11.710 --> 02:09:12.580
Don't play that one.

4921
02:09:12.790 --> 02:09:13.571
Don't play that one.

4922
02:09:13.571 --> 02:09:14.404
Don't play that one.

4923
02:09:14.530 --> 02:09:16.090
Like I took out like shit that I'm,

4924
02:09:16.150 --> 02:09:19.420
I want retired forever that I am not proud of anymore.

4925
02:09:19.550 --> 02:09:19.960
You know,

4926
02:09:19.960 --> 02:09:20.590
as I,

4927
02:09:20.590 --> 02:09:22.870
and that's why I constantly send them new shit too.

4928
02:09:22.871 --> 02:09:24.130
I'm like play this stuff.

4929
02:09:24.160 --> 02:09:25.340
This is the stuff I'm proud of it.

4930
02:09:25.380 --> 02:09:26.470
It's always funny to,

4931
02:09:26.471 --> 02:09:30.280
when you listen to stuff that you think sucks and obviously somebody liked it.

4932
02:09:30.281 --> 02:09:31.240
There's people that were laughing,

4933
02:09:31.241 --> 02:09:33.310
they were playing it when I just thought it sucked.

4934
02:09:33.640 --> 02:09:35.320
When then all of a sudden boom,

4935
02:09:35.350 --> 02:09:36.970
someone comes on is actually funny.

4936
02:09:37.300 --> 02:09:37.960
You know,

4937
02:09:37.960 --> 02:09:42.190
like they played a Brian Post St special and all of a sudden I'm laughing,

4938
02:09:42.490 --> 02:09:42.881
you know,

4939
02:09:42.881 --> 02:09:45.550
like out of nowhere like oh this is actual comedy.

4940
02:09:45.700 --> 02:09:48.130
But before that I was just listening to the nonsense.

4941
02:09:48.280 --> 02:09:52.150
It was like somebody who just like structure a sentence and set in a certain way

4942
02:09:52.330 --> 02:09:53.710
and I'm supposed to think it's hilarious.

4943
02:09:53.711 --> 02:09:56.650
I'm such a fan of comedy that I like when I'm listening to that stuff and

4944
02:09:56.651 --> 02:09:59.710
there's a comic I don't like and all of a sudden they get,

4945
02:09:59.800 --> 02:10:01.540
I get them and I start liking them.

4946
02:10:01.800 --> 02:10:02.170
Like,

4947
02:10:02.170 --> 02:10:04.240
like a comic that I would see in the club and I'm like,

4948
02:10:04.241 --> 02:10:04.301
oh,

4949
02:10:04.301 --> 02:10:04.901
I didn't like that.

4950
02:10:04.901 --> 02:10:07.930
And it might've been five years ago and all of a sudden I hear something new and

4951
02:10:07.931 --> 02:10:08.620
I'm like,

4952
02:10:08.620 --> 02:10:08.771
Oh,

4953
02:10:08.771 --> 02:10:09.790
they've gotten funny.

4954
02:10:10.080 --> 02:10:10.913
And yeah,

4955
02:10:10.930 --> 02:10:13.120
and I like to see like people are like,

4956
02:10:13.121 --> 02:10:14.170
they've actually gotten funny.

4957
02:10:14.650 --> 02:10:17.260
You're telling me you didn't hypnotized and you getting to know like would they

4958
02:10:17.261 --> 02:10:17.980
actually have big,

4959
02:10:17.980 --> 02:10:20.710
I've seen guys that weren't funny becomes so fun.

4960
02:10:20.740 --> 02:10:21.161
Oh yeah.

4961
02:10:21.161 --> 02:10:21.910
Without a Dan.

4962
02:10:21.910 --> 02:10:22.810
It's one of the great,

4963
02:10:22.870 --> 02:10:23.571
like I got,

4964
02:10:23.571 --> 02:10:24.340
it is a beautiful thing.

4965
02:10:24.340 --> 02:10:25.030
I love that.

4966
02:10:25.030 --> 02:10:25.990
And people think,

4967
02:10:25.991 --> 02:10:26.111
oh,

4968
02:10:26.111 --> 02:10:28.600
comics are so competitive and they all hate it and they want to see,

4969
02:10:28.750 --> 02:10:28.991
no,

4970
02:10:28.991 --> 02:10:29.771
I want to see everybody.

4971
02:10:29.771 --> 02:10:32.830
I would love to walk in a comedy club and have every comedian fucking make me

4972
02:10:32.831 --> 02:10:33.140
laugh.

4973
02:10:33.140 --> 02:10:33.973
You buying this?

4974
02:10:34.940 --> 02:10:36.920
I do because I felt the same way.

4975
02:10:36.921 --> 02:10:37.754
And this guy though,

4976
02:10:38.240 --> 02:10:38.860
I mean,

4977
02:10:38.860 --> 02:10:39.340
wow,

4978
02:10:39.340 --> 02:10:40.090
he does cook.

4979
02:10:40.090 --> 02:10:40.491
I mean,

4980
02:10:40.491 --> 02:10:40.640
I,

4981
02:10:40.640 --> 02:10:41.550
I felt the same way.

4982
02:10:41.780 --> 02:10:42.320
There's like,

4983
02:10:42.320 --> 02:10:45.500
Brody Stevens is a perfect example where when I first met Brody,

4984
02:10:45.501 --> 02:10:46.940
I fucking hated him.

4985
02:10:46.941 --> 02:10:51.890
I was scared of him and I always loved block Brodie.

4986
02:10:51.891 --> 02:10:53.600
I don't get it because I knew Brody before you.

4987
02:10:53.601 --> 02:10:55.880
I thought it was all made me laugh from day one.

4988
02:10:55.881 --> 02:10:57.890
I know when he was barking at the comedy cellar,

4989
02:10:58.160 --> 02:10:58.910
I knew him from,

4990
02:10:58.910 --> 02:10:59.451
from uh,

4991
02:10:59.451 --> 02:11:01.370
yelling or opening from the man show.

4992
02:11:01.400 --> 02:11:02.930
He was the audience warm up guy.

4993
02:11:03.200 --> 02:11:04.760
And he was just like really hard.

4994
02:11:04.761 --> 02:11:05.990
Like I remember it was just like,

4995
02:11:06.170 --> 02:11:07.280
like we were slaves,

4996
02:11:07.281 --> 02:11:08.480
like screaming at us.

4997
02:11:08.481 --> 02:11:10.540
I just remember just screaming at us.

4998
02:11:10.550 --> 02:11:11.030
I was like,

4999
02:11:11.030 --> 02:11:13.610
you were probably way too high and you fucking freaked out.

5000
02:11:13.611 --> 02:11:14.150
Yeah.

5001
02:11:14.150 --> 02:11:19.150
Well then I met him a couple months later at the comedy store with you and I got

5002
02:11:19.251 --> 02:11:20.210
to see him and then it was like,

5003
02:11:20.211 --> 02:11:20.780
all right,

5004
02:11:20.780 --> 02:11:22.340
I see what he's doing fucking now.

5005
02:11:22.341 --> 02:11:23.090
I loved sprout it.

5006
02:11:23.090 --> 02:11:25.550
He used to bark outside the comedy cellar to get people,

5007
02:11:25.580 --> 02:11:28.760
he worked for them and his job was to get people in the seats,

5008
02:11:28.761 --> 02:11:29.121
you know,

5009
02:11:29.121 --> 02:11:33.620
come on two for one did it and he was so fucking funny.

5010
02:11:33.950 --> 02:11:37.850
Barking people in people comedy downstairs.

5011
02:11:37.910 --> 02:11:39.650
That's where I think he's like at his best.

5012
02:11:39.680 --> 02:11:41.660
Like he like has a warmup.

5013
02:11:41.690 --> 02:11:42.950
He's like the greatest warmup.

5014
02:11:43.640 --> 02:11:45.500
He's really fun the way he does it.

5015
02:11:45.740 --> 02:11:46.700
And when you,

5016
02:11:46.701 --> 02:11:47.001
you know,

5017
02:11:47.001 --> 02:11:49.970
like when you see a guy like that just completely ad Lib in one of the best

5018
02:11:49.971 --> 02:11:50.751
shows I've ever seen.

5019
02:11:50.751 --> 02:11:52.070
Best sets you'll see,

5020
02:11:52.170 --> 02:11:52.700
you know,

5021
02:11:52.700 --> 02:11:55.400
you know when you see a show and it's like a,

5022
02:11:55.401 --> 02:11:58.990
it's a late show and as many comics had been up and it seems like the room's

5023
02:11:59.000 --> 02:11:59.540
dead.

5024
02:11:59.540 --> 02:12:04.280
And then one guy comes in and just with magic just runs around the room.

5025
02:12:04.520 --> 02:12:09.520
Brody Stevens took his shirt off and started swinging over his head while he was

5026
02:12:09.711 --> 02:12:12.230
screaming for everybody to wake up.

5027
02:12:12.231 --> 02:12:16.820
The show's not over and it was like some music playing and he got on stage,

5028
02:12:16.850 --> 02:12:18.140
he had to play the drums,

5029
02:12:18.290 --> 02:12:19.250
the drum sticks.

5030
02:12:19.280 --> 02:12:19.461
And,

5031
02:12:19.461 --> 02:12:20.840
but it was the way he did it.

5032
02:12:20.841 --> 02:12:22.480
Like it was all ad libbed.

5033
02:12:22.490 --> 02:12:25.400
He just went with the flow of things and took the audience on a ride.

5034
02:12:25.440 --> 02:12:25.880
You know why?

5035
02:12:25.880 --> 02:12:26.960
If you talk to Brody,

5036
02:12:26.961 --> 02:12:27.710
he is,

5037
02:12:27.710 --> 02:12:29.330
he's truly in the moment.

5038
02:12:29.690 --> 02:12:31.970
It's all about that show right there.

5039
02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:32.320
Oh yeah.

5040
02:12:32.320 --> 02:12:33.320
It's not about,

5041
02:12:33.380 --> 02:12:34.100
uh,

5042
02:12:34.100 --> 02:12:39.100
well I already have all those good shows I've done or he's about what am I doing

5043
02:12:39.141 --> 02:12:39.974
right now?

5044
02:12:40.100 --> 02:12:41.000
And he will,

5045
02:12:41.150 --> 02:12:43.910
he'll feel like shit after that show if he didn't do well.

5046
02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:44.833
So He's,

5047
02:12:45.050 --> 02:12:47.870
he's fucking performing for his life.

5048
02:12:47.871 --> 02:12:48.620
He's like,

5049
02:12:48.620 --> 02:12:50.000
I gotta win this crowd.

5050
02:12:50.001 --> 02:12:51.110
I have to kill.

5051
02:12:51.350 --> 02:12:53.330
And there's something about that.

5052
02:12:53.331 --> 02:12:53.780
I mean that,

5053
02:12:53.780 --> 02:12:54.890
that makes them great,

5054
02:12:54.950 --> 02:12:55.783
but he loves it.

5055
02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:56.960
He loves it.

5056
02:12:56.961 --> 02:12:58.790
He's still a fan of standup comedy.

5057
02:12:59.060 --> 02:12:59.390
That's,

5058
02:12:59.390 --> 02:12:59.721
that's,

5059
02:12:59.721 --> 02:13:00.650
those are the best guys.

5060
02:13:00.670 --> 02:13:00.890
The,

5061
02:13:00.890 --> 02:13:03.980
the guys are the most fun of the guys who actually still appreciate it cause it,

5062
02:13:04.210 --> 02:13:07.280
there's a weird thing that happens when somebody has been doing standup for a

5063
02:13:07.281 --> 02:13:10.130
long time and then all of a sudden they decided that I'm talking to hate it.

5064
02:13:10.160 --> 02:13:10.941
I hate standing up,

5065
02:13:10.941 --> 02:13:11.721
I hate my crowd,

5066
02:13:11.721 --> 02:13:12.171
I hate this,

5067
02:13:12.171 --> 02:13:12.741
I hate that.

5068
02:13:12.741 --> 02:13:14.160
And they just don't want to do it anymore.

5069
02:13:14.161 --> 02:13:14.990
And it's like,

5070
02:13:14.990 --> 02:13:15.411
man,

5071
02:13:15.411 --> 02:13:17.360
like I really think you need to rethink this.

5072
02:13:17.690 --> 02:13:19.580
I've gone through phases where it's not that I hate,

5073
02:13:19.610 --> 02:13:20.810
well where I'll go,

5074
02:13:21.110 --> 02:13:23.030
I hate where I'm at right now and I need,

5075
02:13:23.120 --> 02:13:26.450
what happens usually is I started bombing them for a while and it's,

5076
02:13:26.780 --> 02:13:29.090
I actually welcome like a bombing period,

5077
02:13:29.091 --> 02:13:32.100
like have like a month of bombing where a month,

5078
02:13:32.310 --> 02:13:32.630
not,

5079
02:13:32.630 --> 02:13:33.510
not like bombs,

5080
02:13:33.511 --> 02:13:34.380
but like I,

5081
02:13:34.440 --> 02:13:35.191
I'm an extremist.

5082
02:13:35.191 --> 02:13:35.971
I'll say I killed her,

5083
02:13:35.971 --> 02:13:39.570
I bombed and it'll just be average and a it.

5084
02:13:39.810 --> 02:13:42.150
But when I have a bad period,

5085
02:13:42.240 --> 02:13:47.040
I'm usually about to come in to a whole bunch of new shit and it's desperation.

5086
02:13:47.100 --> 02:13:49.180
I'm just angry about everything and the,

5087
02:13:49.210 --> 02:13:49.361
the,

5088
02:13:49.361 --> 02:13:50.194
the act and,

5089
02:13:50.400 --> 02:13:51.270
and then I write,

5090
02:13:51.330 --> 02:13:51.631
you know,

5091
02:13:51.631 --> 02:13:52.321
with Australia,

5092
02:13:52.321 --> 02:13:53.910
I have to write a whole new hour every year,

5093
02:13:53.940 --> 02:13:58.800
have to have like cannot go there without a new hour and I freak out about it.

5094
02:13:58.830 --> 02:14:00.450
Do you really like going there?

5095
02:14:00.810 --> 02:14:01.021
Yeah,

5096
02:14:01.021 --> 02:14:01.930
I do enjoy it.

5097
02:14:02.380 --> 02:14:05.070
But you're already famous there and I wouldn't say famous.

5098
02:14:05.071 --> 02:14:06.690
I mean you're your crowd there.

5099
02:14:06.750 --> 02:14:06.991
Yeah,

5100
02:14:06.991 --> 02:14:08.520
I've got a crowd and I sell tickets,

5101
02:14:08.521 --> 02:14:08.791
you know,

5102
02:14:08.791 --> 02:14:09.330
but not,

5103
02:14:09.330 --> 02:14:13.500
but you don't feel like you're there in America but you want to close.

5104
02:14:13.530 --> 02:14:14.560
No naughty but you want to be right.

5105
02:14:14.820 --> 02:14:15.331
I would love to.

5106
02:14:15.331 --> 02:14:17.850
So why don't you like just put all your emphasis on that?

5107
02:14:17.970 --> 02:14:19.080
I probably should but it's,

5108
02:14:19.081 --> 02:14:19.291
you know,

5109
02:14:19.291 --> 02:14:21.900
I got bills and stuff and in Australia pays the bills.

5110
02:14:21.901 --> 02:14:26.901
I mean how long do you go over there for this year I only did about six weeks.

5111
02:14:27.150 --> 02:14:27.391
Oh,

5112
02:14:27.391 --> 02:14:27.900
okay.

5113
02:14:27.900 --> 02:14:28.320
Okay.

5114
02:14:28.320 --> 02:14:29.010
I thought you were like,

5115
02:14:29.010 --> 02:14:29.320
no,

5116
02:14:29.320 --> 02:14:30.240
I was just an artist.

5117
02:14:30.290 --> 02:14:31.680
Do like six marches there,

5118
02:14:31.710 --> 02:14:34.980
like almost half the year I was doing four months for awhile.

5119
02:14:35.100 --> 02:14:39.000
You know that is pretty bad as though if you can actually live in two different

5120
02:14:39.001 --> 02:14:42.180
countries because Australia is fucking cool as shit.

5121
02:14:42.420 --> 02:14:46.020
If you can get used to being over there and that becomes just like home to you.

5122
02:14:46.080 --> 02:14:47.730
Is it easy to get used to like compare?

5123
02:14:47.790 --> 02:14:50.840
I've never been there absolutely are like Americans.

5124
02:14:51.030 --> 02:14:53.320
It's cooler and I mean yeah they,

5125
02:14:53.321 --> 02:14:55.740
they won't like me saying this but it's like the 51st state.

5126
02:14:55.800 --> 02:14:58.530
Like they're so in tune with everything we're doing right.

5127
02:14:58.770 --> 02:14:59.640
That you just,

5128
02:14:59.700 --> 02:15:01.710
you would be so kind of more relaxed.

5129
02:15:01.711 --> 02:15:01.951
Yeah.

5130
02:15:01.951 --> 02:15:03.510
Way more real and more fun.

5131
02:15:03.540 --> 02:15:04.890
Like the more relaxed,

5132
02:15:04.891 --> 02:15:05.724
like the,

5133
02:15:05.740 --> 02:15:09.750
the men are more like men and women are more like women less hung up.

5134
02:15:10.410 --> 02:15:10.921
Yes.

5135
02:15:10.921 --> 02:15:12.850
Very Texas [inaudible] Texas.

5136
02:15:12.851 --> 02:15:16.710
There's 20 million people in a place as big as America.

5137
02:15:16.800 --> 02:15:17.633
Yeah.

5138
02:15:17.860 --> 02:15:18.180
You know,

5139
02:15:18.180 --> 02:15:19.950
we've got 300 some million people.

5140
02:15:19.951 --> 02:15:21.210
They've got 20 million too.

5141
02:15:21.270 --> 02:15:22.760
So it's just a lot easier.

5142
02:15:22.761 --> 02:15:24.990
You fucking love it there.

5143
02:15:25.020 --> 02:15:25.980
You would love it there.

5144
02:15:26.010 --> 02:15:27.150
It's so nice there.

5145
02:15:27.270 --> 02:15:28.960
The shows are fun as hell to knew.

5146
02:15:28.960 --> 02:15:30.030
The shows are amazing.

5147
02:15:30.120 --> 02:15:30.451
Yeah.

5148
02:15:30.451 --> 02:15:31.270
And it's a,

5149
02:15:31.270 --> 02:15:31.460
the,

5150
02:15:31.460 --> 02:15:32.310
the UFC is,

5151
02:15:32.311 --> 02:15:32.671
we've done,

5152
02:15:32.671 --> 02:15:33.660
there have been amazing.

5153
02:15:33.870 --> 02:15:34.950
I really love it there.

5154
02:15:34.951 --> 02:15:35.551
I've been there.

5155
02:15:35.551 --> 02:15:39.270
There's a few countries that I would think about living in besides America.

5156
02:15:39.300 --> 02:15:40.290
There's only two really.

5157
02:15:40.500 --> 02:15:43.710
Australia is one of them in Canada is another one because it would be the less

5158
02:15:43.740 --> 02:15:47.610
like the least amount of altering my life,

5159
02:15:47.940 --> 02:15:48.301
you know?

5160
02:15:48.301 --> 02:15:49.710
Do they drive on the right side of the road?

5161
02:15:49.711 --> 02:15:50.544
What side of the road?

5162
02:15:50.640 --> 02:15:53.130
The other side tells motherfuckers that's bad.

5163
02:15:53.160 --> 02:15:54.210
That's why I got to live in Glen.

5164
02:15:54.211 --> 02:15:55.530
You had David Lee Roth on,

5165
02:15:55.531 --> 02:15:58.170
I listen to that episode when you're telling a David Lee Roth and he was talking

5166
02:15:58.171 --> 02:16:00.240
about going to Japan and I was like,

5167
02:16:00.241 --> 02:16:01.590
are you fucking crazy?

5168
02:16:01.591 --> 02:16:02.400
So gangster,

5169
02:16:02.400 --> 02:16:03.480
like that's crazy.

5170
02:16:03.510 --> 02:16:04.950
He moves in an apartment in Japan,

5171
02:16:04.951 --> 02:16:06.180
like not knowing anyone,

5172
02:16:06.650 --> 02:16:09.270
one of the biggest rock stars in the history of the universe and just taking

5173
02:16:09.271 --> 02:16:10.980
sword fighting lessons.

5174
02:16:11.190 --> 02:16:12.110
Just dog.

5175
02:16:12.350 --> 02:16:13.350
I wouldn't say that I couldn't,

5176
02:16:13.400 --> 02:16:15.900
I almost went to Japan last like you could do that Brian,

5177
02:16:15.901 --> 02:16:17.810
you know that could be your life someday.

5178
02:16:17.880 --> 02:16:19.230
You could easily be that guy.

5179
02:16:19.270 --> 02:16:20.580
I'm going,

5180
02:16:20.610 --> 02:16:23.370
I'm not saying you'd be David Lee Roth clear on that,

5181
02:16:23.490 --> 02:16:23.820
but,

5182
02:16:23.820 --> 02:16:28.110
but what I mean is you could be the type of guy that just decides to look one

5183
02:16:28.111 --> 02:16:28.471
day.

5184
02:16:28.471 --> 02:16:30.130
Eventually it's going to be ridiculous

5185
02:16:30.130 --> 02:16:31.810
<v 6>that we're all sitting in a room together doing this.</v>

5186
02:16:31.990 --> 02:16:36.990
We won't need to be an emergent technology that's so fucking complete.

5187
02:16:37.750 --> 02:16:39.010
They will all be skyping this.

5188
02:16:39.011 --> 02:16:42.190
We won't need to have like a studio where we show up and this is probably,

5189
02:16:42.870 --> 02:16:43.060
yeah,

5190
02:16:43.060 --> 02:16:44.590
this is probably totally old school.

5191
02:16:44.650 --> 02:16:48.670
So one day we're going to get to a point where there'll be some virtual place

5192
02:16:48.671 --> 02:16:51.880
where we all meet to do a podcast and all we're doing is sitting in front of her

5193
02:16:51.881 --> 02:16:52.750
fucking laptops,

5194
02:16:52.751 --> 02:16:54.470
slapping a head gear on yeah.

5195
02:16:54.530 --> 02:16:55.810
Or something or you know,

5196
02:16:55.811 --> 02:16:57.370
oculus rift or something like that.

5197
02:16:57.490 --> 02:16:59.920
I mean this is Ustream set up in iTunes.

5198
02:16:59.921 --> 02:17:01.420
It's probably going to be archaic in the future.

5199
02:17:01.421 --> 02:17:01.571
I mean,

5200
02:17:01.571 --> 02:17:03.070
being on Sirius satellite radio,

5201
02:17:03.250 --> 02:17:04.720
it's going to be archaic in the future.

5202
02:17:04.750 --> 02:17:04.950
It's,

5203
02:17:04.950 --> 02:17:06.040
this is probably going to be some,

5204
02:17:06.730 --> 02:17:07.750
nobody saw this comment,

5205
02:17:07.751 --> 02:17:08.021
right?

5206
02:17:08.021 --> 02:17:11.890
So who the fuck is going to see what's coming in 50 60 years or less?

5207
02:17:12.070 --> 02:17:12.910
And that's you buddy.

5208
02:17:12.970 --> 02:17:13.720
You're on Maui,

5209
02:17:13.720 --> 02:17:14.470
Maui,

5210
02:17:14.470 --> 02:17:15.303
chillin.

5211
02:17:15.580 --> 02:17:17.080
Fucking tracking of my time.

5212
02:17:17.230 --> 02:17:18.400
Taking a month off of life,

5213
02:17:18.401 --> 02:17:19.100
living there,

5214
02:17:19.100 --> 02:17:20.140
still doing podcasts.

5215
02:17:20.740 --> 02:17:21.490
It's possible.

5216
02:17:21.490 --> 02:17:22.450
It's totally possible.

5217
02:17:22.600 --> 02:17:25.460
I don't plan on being in La very long and um,

5218
02:17:25.480 --> 02:17:29.610
I've been trying to figure out what's possible as far as like where can I live?

5219
02:17:29.690 --> 02:17:29.980
I could

5220
02:17:29.980 --> 02:17:31.580
<v 4>still go to Australia.</v>

5221
02:17:31.610 --> 02:17:32.870
We were having issues with,

5222
02:17:33.380 --> 02:17:36.260
my parents are getting old and I want to be near my parents that they're on the

5223
02:17:36.261 --> 02:17:37.094
east coast,

5224
02:17:37.160 --> 02:17:38.990
but I'm still a five hour flight away.

5225
02:17:38.991 --> 02:17:39.771
Whereas Australia,

5226
02:17:39.771 --> 02:17:40.760
I'm 20 hours away.

5227
02:17:41.190 --> 02:17:41.630
Um,

5228
02:17:41.630 --> 02:17:42.530
my fiance,

5229
02:17:42.680 --> 02:17:43.610
her parents are east coast.

5230
02:17:43.760 --> 02:17:44.810
I met her over there.

5231
02:17:44.811 --> 02:17:45.471
She's an American,

5232
02:17:45.471 --> 02:17:46.304
but I met her there.

5233
02:17:46.340 --> 02:17:49.040
I would probably pick up and leave if we didn't have the,

5234
02:17:49.370 --> 02:17:49.611
you know,

5235
02:17:49.611 --> 02:17:50.540
the families here.

5236
02:17:50.870 --> 02:17:51.530
Uh,

5237
02:17:51.530 --> 02:17:53.690
because I like it that much over there.

5238
02:17:53.930 --> 02:17:54.790
And uh,

5239
02:17:55.160 --> 02:17:57.230
also the dog's taking my dogs over there.

5240
02:17:57.231 --> 02:17:59.010
You got to quarantine them and it's right.

5241
02:17:59.420 --> 02:17:59.601
I mean,

5242
02:17:59.601 --> 02:18:02.930
I'd take them if there was no quarantine and I flew private or something,

5243
02:18:02.931 --> 02:18:03.440
I'd fucking,

5244
02:18:03.440 --> 02:18:03.711
okay,

5245
02:18:03.711 --> 02:18:05.270
so no family,

5246
02:18:06.370 --> 02:18:07.590
no dogs in there.

5247
02:18:07.670 --> 02:18:08.660
Fucking live there.

5248
02:18:08.690 --> 02:18:08.990
Yeah.

5249
02:18:08.990 --> 02:18:09.411
Why not,

5250
02:18:09.411 --> 02:18:09.740
right?

5251
02:18:09.740 --> 02:18:09.980
Yeah.

5252
02:18:09.980 --> 02:18:10.870
You Love Surfing,

5253
02:18:11.160 --> 02:18:11.750
surfing,

5254
02:18:11.750 --> 02:18:12.051
surf.

5255
02:18:12.051 --> 02:18:12.471
Every day.

5256
02:18:12.471 --> 02:18:13.310
I'm just going to sharks.

5257
02:18:13.310 --> 02:18:15.290
There isn't a west coast,

5258
02:18:15.320 --> 02:18:15.831
west coast.

5259
02:18:15.831 --> 02:18:17.750
They had five deaths last year.

5260
02:18:18.290 --> 02:18:19.520
That's how many are in the world.

5261
02:18:19.580 --> 02:18:20.413
Every year.

5262
02:18:20.780 --> 02:18:22.160
They had it in one year.

5263
02:18:22.370 --> 02:18:24.050
That is bad talk.

5264
02:18:24.051 --> 02:18:26.810
It could be a jaws like it's the same shark.

5265
02:18:26.930 --> 02:18:30.920
Oh Jesus Christ and the same and they haven't caught it yet?

5266
02:18:31.670 --> 02:18:32.020
No,

5267
02:18:32.020 --> 02:18:32.451
he was just,

5268
02:18:32.451 --> 02:18:33.920
it was a weird fucking year.

5269
02:18:33.921 --> 02:18:35.360
And I was there this year.

5270
02:18:35.361 --> 02:18:39.380
I went to Perth and I looked to go and surfing and I was going to go down the

5271
02:18:39.380 --> 02:18:40.280
Margaret River and uh,

5272
02:18:41.030 --> 02:18:41.810
I just went,

5273
02:18:41.810 --> 02:18:43.020
hmm.

5274
02:18:43.820 --> 02:18:44.631
I talked to one dude.

5275
02:18:44.631 --> 02:18:45.560
He used to surf there all the time.

5276
02:18:45.561 --> 02:18:46.100
He goes,

5277
02:18:46.100 --> 02:18:46.521
he goes,

5278
02:18:46.521 --> 02:18:49.460
I think about sharks like one out of every 20 times I'm surfing.

5279
02:18:49.461 --> 02:18:50.770
He goes every day.

5280
02:18:51.500 --> 02:18:52.700
I think about them every day though.

5281
02:18:52.701 --> 02:18:53.031
It's just,

5282
02:18:53.031 --> 02:18:54.020
it's been ingrained in us,

5283
02:18:54.021 --> 02:18:56.270
even though it's such an unlikely incident.

5284
02:18:56.271 --> 02:18:57.104
It's in my head.

5285
02:18:57.650 --> 02:18:59.420
I died in Santa Barbara.

5286
02:18:59.730 --> 02:19:00.510
That's like right.

5287
02:19:00.510 --> 02:19:01.460
The north of Santa Barbara.

5288
02:19:01.461 --> 02:19:03.500
It was like near Columbia Beach,

5289
02:19:04.190 --> 02:19:05.023
Surf Beach,

5290
02:19:05.060 --> 02:19:06.290
and there's a good beach.

5291
02:19:06.620 --> 02:19:07.280
I've surfed it.

5292
02:19:07.280 --> 02:19:07.501
But,

5293
02:19:07.501 --> 02:19:08.120
uh,

5294
02:19:08.120 --> 02:19:09.350
the crazy thing about it,

5295
02:19:10.430 --> 02:19:11.570
two years before that,

5296
02:19:11.630 --> 02:19:12.590
same day,

5297
02:19:12.950 --> 02:19:13.783
a shark killed a guy,

5298
02:19:14.240 --> 02:19:14.930
same day,

5299
02:19:14.930 --> 02:19:15.621
same day,

5300
02:19:15.621 --> 02:19:16.454
two years earlier.

5301
02:19:16.610 --> 02:19:16.791
You know,

5302
02:19:16.791 --> 02:19:17.990
when the one scares me the most,

5303
02:19:18.170 --> 02:19:20.840
the one in San Diego where the swimmers swimming.

5304
02:19:20.870 --> 02:19:21.200
Yeah.

5305
02:19:21.200 --> 02:19:22.490
A hundred yards out.

5306
02:19:22.520 --> 02:19:22.850
Yeah.

5307
02:19:22.850 --> 02:19:23.631
They were pretty far.

5308
02:19:23.631 --> 02:19:24.464
I could triathlete.

5309
02:19:24.500 --> 02:19:24.711
Yeah,

5310
02:19:24.711 --> 02:19:25.190
they were.

5311
02:19:25.190 --> 02:19:25.670
Yeah,

5312
02:19:25.670 --> 02:19:26.001
they were.

5313
02:19:26.001 --> 02:19:28.070
They were training and all of a sudden there

5314
02:19:28.080 --> 02:19:29.660
<v 5>though you either people were all with them,</v>

5315
02:19:29.661 --> 02:19:30.740
they're all aligned together,

5316
02:19:30.741 --> 02:19:34.540
they're all training together and you see this one guy just get cut in half,

5317
02:19:34.600 --> 02:19:38.830
but but giant he wearing like a brighter swim suit or anything different than

5318
02:19:38.940 --> 02:19:43.370
just got lucky and this fucking thing is like a 16 foot great white.

5319
02:19:43.371 --> 02:19:45.590
It's a big shock and it caught some right in half.

5320
02:19:45.620 --> 02:19:48.510
You have a better chance of getting killed by like a cow trampoline.

5321
02:19:48.511 --> 02:19:48.890
Stop,

5322
02:19:48.890 --> 02:19:49.723
stop your nonsense.

5323
02:19:49.730 --> 02:19:52.040
That's not true because I'm nowhere near fucking cows.

5324
02:19:52.100 --> 02:19:52.610
Okay?

5325
02:19:52.610 --> 02:19:54.200
If you're out there in the ocean dog,

5326
02:19:54.210 --> 02:19:55.460
your in Shark,

5327
02:19:55.461 --> 02:19:57.770
ted about dogs kill way more people.

5328
02:19:57.800 --> 02:19:59.540
That nonsense scenario,

5329
02:19:59.660 --> 02:20:00.740
there's a boot or trance.

5330
02:20:00.800 --> 02:20:03.100
You get her hip boy learning than kill both shore.

5331
02:20:03.410 --> 02:20:04.243
That's true.

5332
02:20:04.340 --> 02:20:07.580
But that's not true if you're going in the fucking water because most people

5333
02:20:07.581 --> 02:20:08.840
aren't going in the fucking water.

5334
02:20:09.020 --> 02:20:10.100
When people say that shit,

5335
02:20:10.101 --> 02:20:11.650
that's a dumb sticks.

5336
02:20:11.690 --> 02:20:13.790
Still millions to does not work.

5337
02:20:13.950 --> 02:20:16.970
You know you have a 0% chance of dying in a plane crash if you don't get on a

5338
02:20:16.971 --> 02:20:17.804
fucking plane.

5339
02:20:18.340 --> 02:20:18.820
Sure.

5340
02:20:18.820 --> 02:20:19.120
Yeah.

5341
02:20:19.120 --> 02:20:20.960
Well see that's a real statistic.

5342
02:20:21.580 --> 02:20:25.340
Not this nonsense of it's more likely that you get hit by lighting.

5343
02:20:25.910 --> 02:20:26.691
There's a better chance.

5344
02:20:26.691 --> 02:20:29.480
Apparently more people die from vending machines falling on them.

5345
02:20:29.510 --> 02:20:32.330
0% of sharks occur outside of the water.

5346
02:20:32.930 --> 02:20:34.030
No shot.

5347
02:20:34.031 --> 02:20:37.100
If you talked to Australia and you'll think they fucking fly out of the water,

5348
02:20:37.130 --> 02:20:37.820
they can.

5349
02:20:37.820 --> 02:20:38.720
They can fly on the wall,

5350
02:20:38.940 --> 02:20:42.170
which I saw the other day and I was down in Marco Island,

5351
02:20:42.171 --> 02:20:42.531
Florida.

5352
02:20:42.531 --> 02:20:44.300
I saw a sting ray.

5353
02:20:44.960 --> 02:20:49.430
I out of the water like five feet out of the water and then back in and that's

5354
02:20:49.431 --> 02:20:52.190
how that woman died on the boat in,

5355
02:20:52.191 --> 02:20:53.720
in key west or something.

5356
02:20:53.720 --> 02:20:55.160
She was [inaudible] sting.

5357
02:20:55.161 --> 02:20:58.820
Ray just came out and fucking clocked her and she hit the boat and died,

5358
02:20:59.180 --> 02:21:00.560
I think was a head injury.

5359
02:21:00.670 --> 02:21:01.070
Yeah,

5360
02:21:01.070 --> 02:21:01.881
Mike God.

5361
02:21:01.881 --> 02:21:04.070
Could you imagine if you were there and you saw that happen?

5362
02:21:04.071 --> 02:21:05.420
When I saw this thing come out of the water,

5363
02:21:05.421 --> 02:21:05.841
I was like,

5364
02:21:05.841 --> 02:21:07.450
what the fuck?

5365
02:21:07.520 --> 02:21:12.520
Have you seen those fucking fish that fly out of the water when you're driving

5366
02:21:13.071 --> 02:21:17.570
by in a boat or they sorted of an invasive species,

5367
02:21:17.660 --> 02:21:18.680
invasive species.

5368
02:21:18.830 --> 02:21:19.581
There's species,

5369
02:21:19.581 --> 02:21:20.540
I think they're called S.

5370
02:21:20.720 --> 02:21:21.500
I think it's,

5371
02:21:21.500 --> 02:21:21.800
let me,

5372
02:21:21.800 --> 02:21:25.100
let me Google flying fish,

5373
02:21:25.190 --> 02:21:26.023
fish,

5374
02:21:26.340 --> 02:21:28.070
snake heads or something like that.

5375
02:21:28.580 --> 02:21:29.530
I think it's a snake.

5376
02:21:29.531 --> 02:21:29.691
It,

5377
02:21:29.691 --> 02:21:31.010
I might be confusing my fish.

5378
02:21:31.230 --> 02:21:31.790
You'll,

5379
02:21:31.790 --> 02:21:32.271
what these,

5380
02:21:32.271 --> 02:21:35.960
these fucking things do is they fly out of the water

5381
02:21:37.910 --> 02:21:38.531
and the,

5382
02:21:38.531 --> 02:21:41.900
these people would drive in boats and they are like literally a launching

5383
02:21:41.901 --> 02:21:44.210
themselves that you can hit him with tennis rackets.

5384
02:21:44.540 --> 02:21:45.373
It's crazy.

5385
02:21:46.780 --> 02:21:47.140
I'm gonna,

5386
02:21:47.140 --> 02:21:48.710
I'm gonna see if I can find the,

5387
02:21:48.711 --> 02:21:49.460
uh,

5388
02:21:49.460 --> 02:21:50.760
the very fine.

5389
02:21:51.020 --> 02:21:51.230
Well,

5390
02:21:51.230 --> 02:21:52.063
you're looking for that.

5391
02:21:52.070 --> 02:21:54.440
I know a guy that's been attacked by a shark twice.

5392
02:21:54.500 --> 02:21:55.191
Oh my God.

5393
02:21:55.191 --> 02:21:55.341
What?

5394
02:21:55.341 --> 02:21:56.170
Is he retarded?

5395
02:21:56.170 --> 02:21:56.450
Yeah,

5396
02:21:56.450 --> 02:21:57.360
he does.

5397
02:21:57.380 --> 02:21:58.250
He hate himself.

5398
02:21:58.460 --> 02:21:59.460
You can Google him.

5399
02:21:59.750 --> 02:22:00.261
Ben Vinay.

5400
02:22:00.261 --> 02:22:00.771
And he was,

5401
02:22:00.771 --> 02:22:01.490
uh,

5402
02:22:01.490 --> 02:22:02.310
he was in,

5403
02:22:02.310 --> 02:22:03.040
uh,

5404
02:22:03.040 --> 02:22:03.873
uh,

5405
02:22:03.930 --> 02:22:05.300
a friend of mine hooked me up with them.

5406
02:22:05.301 --> 02:22:05.631
They're like,

5407
02:22:05.631 --> 02:22:06.200
hey,

5408
02:22:06.200 --> 02:22:07.940
this dude will take you surfing tomorrow.

5409
02:22:08.060 --> 02:22:09.230
And we were out in a bar and I was like,

5410
02:22:09.231 --> 02:22:09.621
oh cool,

5411
02:22:09.621 --> 02:22:10.311
where are we going to surf?

5412
02:22:10.311 --> 02:22:10.820
He goes,

5413
02:22:10.820 --> 02:22:12.140
we'll serve tallow speech,

5414
02:22:12.350 --> 02:22:13.880
which is on one side of Byron Bay.

5415
02:22:13.881 --> 02:22:18.080
And I if stood up at the lighthouse and look down at Talus and if you look down,

5416
02:22:18.081 --> 02:22:19.190
you can see dolphins,

5417
02:22:19.191 --> 02:22:19.731
sharks,

5418
02:22:19.731 --> 02:22:20.510
whales,

5419
02:22:20.510 --> 02:22:21.680
all kinds of shit in the water.

5420
02:22:21.690 --> 02:22:22.130
I go,

5421
02:22:22.130 --> 02:22:23.300
I'm not fucking surfing there.

5422
02:22:23.510 --> 02:22:24.343
And he goes,

5423
02:22:24.530 --> 02:22:24.711
ah,

5424
02:22:24.711 --> 02:22:25.321
it's cool man.

5425
02:22:25.321 --> 02:22:25.651
It's real.

5426
02:22:25.651 --> 02:22:26.040
I surfing

5427
02:22:26.040 --> 02:22:27.060
<v 4>all the time and I go,</v>

5428
02:22:27.150 --> 02:22:27.511
no way,

5429
02:22:27.511 --> 02:22:27.721
man.

5430
02:22:27.721 --> 02:22:28.680
Too much sea life there.

5431
02:22:28.681 --> 02:22:29.281
I'm not going in.

5432
02:22:29.281 --> 02:22:29.950
And he goes,

5433
02:22:29.950 --> 02:22:30.783
he goes,

5434
02:22:31.200 --> 02:22:31.561
he goes,

5435
02:22:31.561 --> 02:22:32.640
I've been attacked.

5436
02:22:32.910 --> 02:22:34.110
He starts telling me the story.

5437
02:22:34.111 --> 02:22:34.650
I go,

5438
02:22:34.650 --> 02:22:35.910
I saw you on the news,

5439
02:22:36.060 --> 02:22:36.900
I saw you on the news.

5440
02:22:36.901 --> 02:22:37.720
You're the guy.

5441
02:22:37.720 --> 02:22:38.071
And he goes,

5442
02:22:38.071 --> 02:22:38.221
yeah.

5443
02:22:38.221 --> 02:22:39.690
And I go find them going with you.

5444
02:22:39.750 --> 02:22:40.510
What are the chances?

5445
02:22:40.510 --> 02:22:42.690
Most unlikely incident happened to the same,

5446
02:22:42.740 --> 02:22:42.850
uh,

5447
02:22:42.850 --> 02:22:43.091
you know,

5448
02:22:43.091 --> 02:22:43.924
like so.

5449
02:22:44.010 --> 02:22:44.431
And he goes,

5450
02:22:44.431 --> 02:22:44.671
well,

5451
02:22:44.671 --> 02:22:45.140
I've,

5452
02:22:45.140 --> 02:22:48.240
I've been attacked twice and I go fuck off.

5453
02:22:48.510 --> 02:22:51.660
And he told me another time he was out there and a bunch of Makos were

5454
02:22:51.661 --> 02:22:52.980
frolicking and he'd see them.

5455
02:22:52.981 --> 02:22:53.191
Now,

5456
02:22:53.191 --> 02:22:54.540
if I saw that I'm out of the water,

5457
02:22:54.541 --> 02:22:55.500
what's wrong with him?

5458
02:22:55.650 --> 02:22:56.550
And uh,

5459
02:22:56.670 --> 02:22:57.361
he said,

5460
02:22:57.361 --> 02:22:57.631
uh,

5461
02:22:57.631 --> 02:22:58.530
one of them broke free,

5462
02:22:58.531 --> 02:23:02.460
came at him and he just like started like punching at it and like pushing it

5463
02:23:02.461 --> 02:23:03.071
away and it,

5464
02:23:03.071 --> 02:23:04.080
and it left him alone.

5465
02:23:04.080 --> 02:23:04.560
But,

5466
02:23:04.560 --> 02:23:05.060
but the,

5467
02:23:05.060 --> 02:23:05.670
the,

5468
02:23:05.670 --> 02:23:06.570
the other shark,

5469
02:23:06.571 --> 02:23:07.650
I think it was a white pointer,

5470
02:23:07.920 --> 02:23:09.450
a bit his board.

5471
02:23:09.451 --> 02:23:10.590
And you could see the teeth marks.

5472
02:23:10.591 --> 02:23:11.820
You can Google and look at the picture.

5473
02:23:11.850 --> 02:23:12.061
Is it,

5474
02:23:12.061 --> 02:23:14.040
cause they're like internal hemorrhoids or something like that,

5475
02:23:14.041 --> 02:23:14.580
you think?

5476
02:23:14.580 --> 02:23:15.960
What did they came after him?

5477
02:23:15.961 --> 02:23:16.800
Cause the blood thing.

5478
02:23:16.830 --> 02:23:20.280
I cut my foot the other day and Australia pretty bad and I didn't realize it was

5479
02:23:20.281 --> 02:23:23.610
bad because you know when you're in water constantly,

5480
02:23:23.611 --> 02:23:24.444
the bloods,

5481
02:23:24.840 --> 02:23:25.621
Google flying,

5482
02:23:25.621 --> 02:23:30.621
silver carp fish flying silver carp are the ones that fly on the fucking water

5483
02:23:31.231 --> 02:23:32.400
when we drive your boat.

5484
02:23:32.430 --> 02:23:32.611
Yeah.

5485
02:23:32.611 --> 02:23:35.160
Apparently it's a little bit of blood that has to be in the water.

5486
02:23:35.161 --> 02:23:35.994
That's it.

5487
02:23:36.050 --> 02:23:36.230
Yeah.

5488
02:23:36.230 --> 02:23:37.260
It's probably internal hemorrhoids.

5489
02:23:37.261 --> 02:23:41.320
He might be getting turned out every night and that's why he kept on [inaudible]

5490
02:23:41.380 --> 02:23:43.970
please will you just fucking think about what you're saying before he said,

5491
02:23:43.971 --> 02:23:44.601
well if it's there,

5492
02:23:44.601 --> 02:23:45.301
a little blood in your,

5493
02:23:45.301 --> 02:23:46.134
but yeah,

5494
02:23:46.360 --> 02:23:50.160
apparently it's just a little bit of blood that can use all it takes.

5495
02:23:50.240 --> 02:23:50.711
<v 7>They used to be,</v>

5496
02:23:50.711 --> 02:23:51.501
I was on there period.

5497
02:23:51.501 --> 02:23:54.110
Like probably should never go in the water if sharks.

5498
02:23:54.140 --> 02:23:54.973
Yeah,

5499
02:23:55.010 --> 02:23:55.181
<v 4>no,</v>

5500
02:23:55.181 --> 02:23:55.821
they say that.

5501
02:23:55.821 --> 02:23:56.654
They say that.

5502
02:23:56.760 --> 02:23:57.010
Yeah.

5503
02:23:57.010 --> 02:23:57.200
Yeah,

5504
02:23:57.200 --> 02:23:57.770
absolutely.

5505
02:23:57.770 --> 02:23:58.670
<v 7>I just don't get it.</v>

5506
02:23:58.700 --> 02:23:59.400
I mean I,

5507
02:23:59.400 --> 02:24:01.310
I would imagine it would be really fun,

5508
02:24:01.490 --> 02:24:02.270
but I just can't,

5509
02:24:02.270 --> 02:24:04.280
I can't believe it'd be fun enough to risk.

5510
02:24:04.360 --> 02:24:05.980
<v 4>There used to be a rumor that uh,</v>

5511
02:24:06.100 --> 02:24:07.390
if you piss in your wetsuit,

5512
02:24:07.391 --> 02:24:08.131
which everyone does,

5513
02:24:08.131 --> 02:24:08.480
that the,

5514
02:24:08.480 --> 02:24:09.700
the urine gives off.

5515
02:24:09.701 --> 02:24:11.920
The same kind of sent that the blood does,

5516
02:24:11.921 --> 02:24:14.530
that attracts the sharks because there was a guy in South Africa,

5517
02:24:14.710 --> 02:24:16.180
you need to see this video.

5518
02:24:16.240 --> 02:24:18.010
He's riding the wave,

5519
02:24:18.100 --> 02:24:20.620
he's up cruising down the wave,

5520
02:24:20.920 --> 02:24:22.600
up and down on the face of the wave.

5521
02:24:22.900 --> 02:24:27.900
And two sharks converge on Him and grab him by the arm and they,

5522
02:24:28.510 --> 02:24:29.740
they ran into each other.

5523
02:24:29.741 --> 02:24:31.090
And that's why they let go of them.

5524
02:24:31.390 --> 02:24:31.661
But,

5525
02:24:31.661 --> 02:24:31.830
uh,

5526
02:24:31.830 --> 02:24:32.530
she's guys

5527
02:24:32.530 --> 02:24:34.180
<v 7>getting nailed by these fucking fish.</v>

5528
02:24:34.210 --> 02:24:36.100
They fly through the air and they're all bloody too.

5529
02:24:36.101 --> 02:24:36.610
What the fuck?

5530
02:24:36.610 --> 02:24:36.731
Well,

5531
02:24:36.731 --> 02:24:38.900
they land and they were fucking shattered.

5532
02:24:38.910 --> 02:24:41.140
Or like other guys just look at these fucking things.

5533
02:24:41.141 --> 02:24:42.220
They just fly through the air,

5534
02:24:42.221 --> 02:24:42.460
man.

5535
02:24:42.460 --> 02:24:43.330
They're all over the place.

5536
02:24:43.540 --> 02:24:44.081
What do they call it?

5537
02:24:44.081 --> 02:24:44.860
Silver,

5538
02:24:44.860 --> 02:24:45.581
silver carp.

5539
02:24:45.581 --> 02:24:46.730
And they're an invasive species.

5540
02:24:46.731 --> 02:24:47.500
See that?

5541
02:24:47.500 --> 02:24:51.110
Like as these guys are looking at that they're just flying all over the place.

5542
02:24:51.111 --> 02:24:51.820
Frog fish.

5543
02:24:51.820 --> 02:24:52.001
I mean,

5544
02:24:52.001 --> 02:24:53.860
they literally launched themselves in the air.

5545
02:24:54.100 --> 02:24:57.790
And sometimes when you go through like a whole school of them and there's like

5546
02:24:57.791 --> 02:24:58.630
an infestation,

5547
02:24:58.631 --> 02:25:00.010
like it really can be dangerous.

5548
02:25:00.310 --> 02:25:01.750
People getting hit in the head and shit.

5549
02:25:01.960 --> 02:25:04.090
And these things are an invasive species,

5550
02:25:04.091 --> 02:25:05.080
like they've taken off.

5551
02:25:05.290 --> 02:25:06.520
They're not supposed to be there,

5552
02:25:06.521 --> 02:25:07.100
I don't think.

5553
02:25:07.100 --> 02:25:09.160
And I think if I remember correctly,

5554
02:25:09.420 --> 02:25:09.940
they uh,

5555
02:25:09.940 --> 02:25:10.271
some of the,

5556
02:25:10.271 --> 02:25:13.930
introduced him to these areas and now they're just fucking taken off like crazy.

5557
02:25:13.960 --> 02:25:15.170
How often were you seeing other fish?

5558
02:25:15.330 --> 02:25:19.980
<v 4>I'm going to look good the next room or get really big and just go down here and</v>

5559
02:25:19.981 --> 02:25:20.510
get attacked.

5560
02:25:20.510 --> 02:25:23.970
And how funny it would be if you tie that way that was on mushrooms and a

5561
02:25:23.980 --> 02:25:26.050
<v 7>fish lodged in his mouth.</v>

5562
02:25:26.320 --> 02:25:27.610
I think I'd rather choke to death.

5563
02:25:27.640 --> 02:25:31.720
I think I'd rather die from a shark attacked in one of these things.

5564
02:25:31.721 --> 02:25:32.560
Fucking things.

5565
02:25:32.590 --> 02:25:33.400
What a crazy ass.

5566
02:25:33.400 --> 02:25:34.450
Toronto's would be bad.

5567
02:25:34.510 --> 02:25:36.040
Paranas would be awful.

5568
02:25:36.070 --> 02:25:38.140
What is wrong with these fucking fish man?

5569
02:25:39.070 --> 02:25:40.000
It's so weird.

5570
02:25:40.960 --> 02:25:43.000
Did you ever watch them noodle the catfish?

5571
02:25:43.810 --> 02:25:44.410
Yes.

5572
02:25:44.410 --> 02:25:44.591
Yeah.

5573
02:25:44.591 --> 02:25:45.880
I love those shows.

5574
02:25:46.570 --> 02:25:48.480
I was in my fucking hotel room,

5575
02:25:48.500 --> 02:25:50.980
I forgot where it was and I was bored out of my mind.

5576
02:25:50.981 --> 02:25:55.981
So I watched an entire episode of this show where they like stick their hands

5577
02:25:56.051 --> 02:25:59.310
and holes and get catfish if you don't know her arms,

5578
02:25:59.350 --> 02:26:00.760
like yeah,

5579
02:26:00.761 --> 02:26:02.170
if you don't know what noodling is,

5580
02:26:02.171 --> 02:26:03.430
it's the weirdest fucking thing.

5581
02:26:03.450 --> 02:26:05.260
I go through the mouth and out the gill,

5582
02:26:05.710 --> 02:26:07.810
it's discussed and then pick them up.

5583
02:26:08.040 --> 02:26:08.291
I mean,

5584
02:26:08.291 --> 02:26:10.960
they're like like hundreds of pounds.

5585
02:26:10.990 --> 02:26:14.140
You know these fucking silver carp can get to be a hundred pounds.

5586
02:26:15.010 --> 02:26:15.880
That'll knock you the fuck.

5587
02:26:15.920 --> 02:26:19.690
You got to be 110 pounds and they fly through the fucking air.

5588
02:26:19.691 --> 02:26:24.130
They were imported from China in the 1970s for use in a co aquaculture ponds to

5589
02:26:24.131 --> 02:26:25.120
control plankton.

5590
02:26:25.300 --> 02:26:29.350
By the early 1980s both species had escaped into open waters in the southern

5591
02:26:29.351 --> 02:26:30.184
states.

5592
02:26:30.700 --> 02:26:31.630
Wow.

5593
02:26:31.660 --> 02:26:35.080
This is a fish called a big head and the other one called a silver carp.

5594
02:26:35.140 --> 02:26:36.310
Here's a dude noodling.

5595
02:26:36.730 --> 02:26:38.020
This is fucking nuts,

5596
02:26:38.021 --> 02:26:38.680
man.

5597
02:26:38.680 --> 02:26:40.780
No established populations are known.

5598
02:26:42.370 --> 02:26:45.100
The carp have been caught by commercial fishermen over the last few years.

5599
02:26:45.101 --> 02:26:46.390
Apparently people started eating him.

5600
02:26:46.870 --> 02:26:49.390
Is that what an invasive species is when they bring it in?

5601
02:26:49.510 --> 02:26:50.290
Yeah.

5602
02:26:50.290 --> 02:26:51.340
They bring a fish.

5603
02:26:52.030 --> 02:26:52.863
Was that noodling?

5604
02:26:53.350 --> 02:26:56.530
These guys are so crazy because sometimes they get turtles.

5605
02:26:56.740 --> 02:26:59.320
They reach in there and it snapping turtles in there and they get their fucking

5606
02:26:59.321 --> 02:27:00.160
hand bitten off.

5607
02:27:00.490 --> 02:27:02.740
Like guys have gotten fucked up doing this

5608
02:27:07.750 --> 02:27:08.583
<v 9>Rodeo cat.</v>

Cause you gotta get a good grip on those counts.

5614
02:27:18.900 --> 02:27:19.610
It's a really,

5615
02:27:19.610 --> 02:27:22.120
it's such a primal way that's looks fake.

5616
02:27:22.960 --> 02:27:23.860
It looks completely fake.

5617
02:27:23.930 --> 02:27:24.480
<v 7>Is it fake?</v>

5618
02:27:24.480 --> 02:27:25.313
I don't know.

5619
02:27:26.010 --> 02:27:27.370
It looks fake but um,

5620
02:27:27.660 --> 02:27:28.070

5621
02:27:28.070 --> 02:27:28.501

5626
02:27:38.040 --> 02:27:39.590

5627
02:27:40.430 --> 02:27:40.671
<v 7>Wow.</v>

5628
02:27:40.671 --> 02:27:41.720

5629
02:27:42.670 --> 02:27:43.880
That was a weird,

5630
02:27:44.120 --> 02:27:47.840

5632
02:27:49.780 --> 02:27:50.613
man?

5633
02:27:51.020 --> 02:27:51.830
What a beauty.

5634
02:27:51.830 --> 02:27:52.940
It's hard to tell him that picture.

5635
02:27:52.941 --> 02:27:53.990
What's really going on.

5636
02:27:57.450 --> 02:27:58.283
<v 9>Alright.</v>

5637
02:27:58.600 --> 02:27:59.080

He's going to let us say for he,

5639
02:28:00.920 --> 02:28:01.990
it's hard to tell if that's real.

5640
02:28:02.250 --> 02:28:02.710
Yes.

5641
02:28:02.710 --> 02:28:04.660
I'm sure there's some that are online that are real,

5642
02:28:04.810 --> 02:28:08.620
but grab your arm and put in the mouth of a hundred pound animal.

5643
02:28:08.650 --> 02:28:09.250
Yeah.

5644
02:28:09.250 --> 02:28:09.660
All of that.

5645
02:28:09.660 --> 02:28:11.050
And it's in its environment,

5646
02:28:11.170 --> 02:28:13.930
not going to fucking think people understand how strong a fucking hundred pound

5647
02:28:13.931 --> 02:28:14.411
catfish.

5648
02:28:14.411 --> 02:28:14.950
It's either.

5649
02:28:14.950 --> 02:28:15.190

<v 0>of these 200 pounds.</v>

5655
02:28:23.840 --> 02:28:27.390
That's what these are when y'all can musky feminine.

5656
02:28:27.800 --> 02:28:28.800
Why are they so confidence?

5657
02:28:29.030 --> 02:28:29.430
Hold on.

5658
02:28:29.430 --> 02:28:30.263
These things,

5659
02:28:30.300 --> 02:28:35.300
those things are still alive but is how weird is it that they can hold on to

5660
02:28:35.661 --> 02:28:36.494
these things?

5661
02:28:36.670 --> 02:28:37.600
<v 7>They're still alive.</v>

5662
02:28:37.601 --> 02:28:38.381
They're in the water.

5663
02:28:38.381 --> 02:28:41.110
Why don't they just freak out and give free like their holy,

5664
02:28:41.260 --> 02:28:42.790
if you don't watch the show,

5665
02:28:43.300 --> 02:28:44.680
if you'll just listening to these two,

5666
02:28:44.980 --> 02:28:45.731
it seems like Russian,

5667
02:28:45.731 --> 02:28:46.320
right?

5668
02:28:46.320 --> 02:28:47.153
<v 0>Speaking Russian,</v>

5669
02:28:55.850 --> 02:28:56.683
Spanish.

5670
02:28:57.710 --> 02:28:58.543
Is that Spanish?

5671
02:29:00.140 --> 02:29:00.351
Yeah.

5672
02:29:00.351 --> 02:29:02.610
That sounds like almost Italian fanatic.

5673
02:29:04.610 --> 02:29:04.851
Yeah.

5674
02:29:04.851 --> 02:29:06.230
It sounds like it sounds Italian.

5675
02:29:06.260 --> 02:29:09.020
Finally these fucking catfish.

5676
02:29:09.021 --> 02:29:09.441

These Cafritz she's guys are holding our fucking,

5679
02:29:12.581 --> 02:29:12.780

<v 7>Boats.</v>

5681
02:29:14.130 --> 02:29:15.000
Their boats.

5682
02:29:15.060 --> 02:29:15.600
Yeah.

5683
02:29:15.600 --> 02:29:17.880
That's a seven foot long sides of a dolphin.

5684
02:29:17.940 --> 02:29:18.470
Yeah,

5685
02:29:18.470 --> 02:29:19.020
exactly.

5686
02:29:19.020 --> 02:29:19.560
Exactly.

5687
02:29:19.560 --> 02:29:20.460
It's like a dolphin size.

5688
02:29:20.880 --> 02:29:21.713
It's insane.

5689
02:29:23.400 --> 02:29:24.510
When they catch those things,

5690
02:29:24.511 --> 02:29:24.870
man,

5691
02:29:24.870 --> 02:29:26.940
those things feed a whole fucking village.

5692
02:29:27.740 --> 02:29:28.561
How are they going to let it go?

5693
02:29:28.561 --> 02:29:29.170
Look at that.

5694
02:29:29.170 --> 02:29:30.003
Good for you.

5695
02:29:31.020 --> 02:29:32.580

I call upon you.

5699
02:29:40.720 --> 02:29:41.320
<v 0>There's a,</v>

5700
02:29:41.320 --> 02:29:42.270
the largest cat

5701
02:29:42.350 --> 02:29:43.310
<v 7>fish ever caught.</v>

5702
02:29:43.311 --> 02:29:44.470
There's a photo of this,

5703
02:29:44.471 --> 02:29:44.750
uh,

5704
02:29:44.750 --> 02:29:45.120
this,

5705
02:29:45.120 --> 02:29:45.380
uh,

5706
02:29:45.380 --> 02:29:47.210
I think it was like Thailand or someone like that.

5707
02:29:47.400 --> 02:29:47.630
They,

5708
02:29:47.630 --> 02:29:50.450
they caught this insanely large cat fish.

5709
02:29:50.750 --> 02:29:51.201
I mean,

5710
02:29:51.201 --> 02:29:53.690
and it shows like this whole like village,

5711
02:29:53.720 --> 02:29:56.540
like participating in cooking and eating as catfish,

5712
02:29:56.900 --> 02:29:57.380
but it's,

5713
02:29:57.380 --> 02:29:58.430
it's a whale.

5714
02:29:58.760 --> 02:30:01.510
I mean the largest cat Google that largest,

5715
02:30:02.290 --> 02:30:03.020
I don't know.

5716
02:30:03.020 --> 02:30:03.411
I don't know.

5717
02:30:03.411 --> 02:30:03.981
I don't remember.

5718
02:30:03.981 --> 02:30:04.671
I don't want even say,

5719
02:30:04.671 --> 02:30:06.290
because we could find it soon.

5720
02:30:06.700 --> 02:30:09.270
Catfish ever.

5721
02:30:10.640 --> 02:30:12.320
I think it's something enormous,

5722
02:30:12.321 --> 02:30:13.580
like over a thousand pounds.

5723
02:30:13.690 --> 02:30:13.940
Wow.

5724
02:30:13.940 --> 02:30:17.030
Here's a 220 pounds and cock cat fish being caught.

5725
02:30:21.370 --> 02:30:26.370
Let's say the nine largest fish ever caught apparently catfishes in that mix,

5726
02:30:28.760 --> 02:30:29.750
which is insane.

5727
02:30:29.780 --> 02:30:32.330
I think the largest fish ever caught as a shark.

5728
02:30:32.880 --> 02:30:34.370
It fuck if I'm correct.

5729
02:30:34.880 --> 02:30:37.520
I think like a Maaco shark is like one of the largest fish.

5730
02:30:37.540 --> 02:30:37.941
I really am.

5731
02:30:37.941 --> 02:30:38.900
Maaco yeah,

5732
02:30:38.901 --> 02:30:40.910
blue cat is number nine.

5733
02:30:40.940 --> 02:30:41.301
Okay.

5734
02:30:41.301 --> 02:30:42.980

5735
02:30:42.981 --> 02:30:43.814

5736
02:30:45.370 --> 02:30:45.541
Oh,

5737
02:30:45.541 --> 02:30:46.900
it's not nearly as big as I thought.

5738
02:30:47.050 --> 02:30:48.820
It's 130 pounds.

5739
02:30:48.880 --> 02:30:49.121
Okay.

5740
02:30:49.121 --> 02:30:52.750
That's not the biggest cat for now because that one was the one where just 220

5741
02:30:52.751 --> 02:30:53.410

5742
02:30:53.410 --> 02:30:54.243

02:31:07.781 --> 02:31:09.390
Basking sharks.

Pretty sure.

5765
02:31:36.380 --> 02:31:37.090
I'm not sure,

5766
02:31:37.090 --> 02:31:39.100

5767

5775
02:31:53.110 --> 02:31:54.280
That's some serious cash.

5776
02:31:54.310 --> 02:31:54.491
Yeah.

5777
02:31:54.491 --> 02:31:55.570
That's a crazy fish.

5778
02:31:55.571 --> 02:31:57.310
Two tuners are just all muscle.

5779
02:31:57.340 --> 02:31:57.550
Yeah,

5780
02:31:57.550 --> 02:31:58.750
they're super gangster.

5781
02:31:59.050 --> 02:31:59.680
You know,

5782
02:31:59.680 --> 02:32:02.020
they're just flying around in giant schools,

5783
02:32:02.050 --> 02:32:03.190
Jack and other fish.

5784
02:32:03.191 --> 02:32:06.700
So if you can catch one that's a thousand fucking pounds.

5785
02:32:06.701 --> 02:32:07.930
A lot of my engine,

5786
02:32:07.931 --> 02:32:10.150
a hundred thousand thousand pounders under,

5787
02:32:10.240 --> 02:32:10.901
under the ocean,

5788
02:32:10.901 --> 02:32:14.680
just fucking everything up in front of them and some asshole comes along with a

5789
02:32:14.681 --> 02:32:19.681
fake fish and just gang some I went down in the cage in South Africa with the

5790
02:32:19.961 --> 02:32:20.710
great whites.

5791
02:32:20.710 --> 02:32:22.090
Oh you silly bitch.

5792
02:32:22.150 --> 02:32:23.200
And uh,

5793
02:32:23.710 --> 02:32:25.660
when you see these things coming at you,

5794
02:32:26.380 --> 02:32:27.370
monsters,

5795
02:32:27.810 --> 02:32:28.650
monsters,

5796
02:32:28.750 --> 02:32:33.010
why did you do that where you totally completely convinced that they were going

5797
02:32:33.011 --> 02:32:34.510
to be able to keep their things away from you?

5798
02:32:34.590 --> 02:32:34.960
I eat,

5799
02:32:34.960 --> 02:32:38.680
well they put you in the cage and the top of the cage is open to the boat so you

5800
02:32:38.681 --> 02:32:41.350
can like climb out of the cage and into the boat.

5801
02:32:41.351 --> 02:32:43.750
So it's almost like you're in a steel cage,

5802
02:32:43.751 --> 02:32:45.600
aquarium and a,

5803
02:32:45.610 --> 02:32:48.250
but you got to put on a wetsuit and the snorkel and everything and they,

5804
02:32:48.430 --> 02:32:49.810
they either run an oxygen,

5805
02:32:49.840 --> 02:32:50.110
you know,

5806
02:32:50.110 --> 02:32:54.190
like thing down to you or you were like a snorkel and you go up and down.

5807
02:32:54.220 --> 02:32:55.560
Like you hold your breath,

5808
02:32:55.580 --> 02:32:56.830
go down and worked for awhile,

5809
02:32:57.400 --> 02:33:00.730
but you wait for four hours for the sharks to show up.

5810
02:33:01.330 --> 02:33:01.770
They,

5811
02:33:01.770 --> 02:33:04.810
they put fish oil in the water because it's illegal to put chum in the water.

5812
02:33:05.140 --> 02:33:05.973
They can't do that.

5813
02:33:06.160 --> 02:33:11.110
Well we're aren't there like there was a show that they were filming in South

5814
02:33:11.110 --> 02:33:11.111
Africa.

5815
02:33:11.111 --> 02:33:12.250
I believe we were there.

5816
02:33:12.251 --> 02:33:12.940
We were down at,

5817
02:33:12.940 --> 02:33:13.390
uh,

5818
02:33:13.390 --> 02:33:14.850
I forget what the area,

5819
02:33:14.851 --> 02:33:17.050
here we are and I think her madness and a,

5820
02:33:17.060 --> 02:33:20.830
there's a place like seal island where they blame these people for,

5821
02:33:21.100 --> 02:33:25.300
for a death because they were chumming to get the sharks to catch sharks on

5822
02:33:25.301 --> 02:33:26.134
their show.

5823
02:33:26.380 --> 02:33:27.213
So they,

5824
02:33:27.420 --> 02:33:28.750
so they made that illegal,

5825
02:33:29.080 --> 02:33:31.450
but they still put fish oil in those not the same thing.

5826
02:33:31.451 --> 02:33:32.030
And they,

5827
02:33:32.030 --> 02:33:33.760
the I I think so pretty much.

5828
02:33:33.790 --> 02:33:34.623
And uh,

5829
02:33:34.750 --> 02:33:38.500
they put fish oil in the water and get that fucking catfish.

5830
02:33:38.560 --> 02:33:39.580
Holy Fuck.

5831
02:33:39.880 --> 02:33:40.713
<v 9>Okay.</v>

5832
02:33:41.270 --> 02:33:42.350
<v 5>Oh my gosh.</v>

5833
02:33:42.351 --> 02:33:42.801
The size,

5834
02:33:42.801 --> 02:33:43.640
size of a dolphin,

5835
02:33:46.350 --> 02:33:47.101
there's pictures of them.

5836
02:33:47.101 --> 02:33:47.731
That's the tuna.

5837
02:33:47.731 --> 02:33:50.040
That's the biggest fish ever caught apparently.

5838
02:33:50.100 --> 02:33:51.000
But these great whites,

5839
02:33:51.001 --> 02:33:52.080
they were the big fuckers.

5840
02:33:52.170 --> 02:33:53.003
They were,

5841
02:33:53.200 --> 02:33:53.580
<v 9>yeah.</v>

5842
02:33:53.580 --> 02:33:55.170
<v 5>As big as you can imagine.</v>

5843
02:33:55.200 --> 02:33:57.120
How big do you think the biggest great white is?

5844
02:33:57.930 --> 02:33:58.763
How big is it?

5845
02:33:58.860 --> 02:33:59.641
What's the biggest great,

5846
02:33:59.641 --> 02:34:00.281
whatever caught,

5847
02:34:00.281 --> 02:34:02.620
cause it seems like a great white would be heavier than it tuned Robin,

5848
02:34:02.640 --> 02:34:03.331
like 20 foot.

5849
02:34:03.331 --> 02:34:04.164
Does that make sense?

5850
02:34:04.800 --> 02:34:05.110
Let's,

5851
02:34:05.110 --> 02:34:07.140
let's say biggest quate weight ever caught.

5852
02:34:08.520 --> 02:34:12.720
I mean I was looking at ones that were at least 12 at least 12 feet long.

5853
02:34:12.750 --> 02:34:13.110
Yeah.

5854
02:34:13.110 --> 02:34:13.671
How much is it?

5855
02:34:13.671 --> 02:34:15.420
12 foot long fucking shark way.

5856
02:34:15.580 --> 02:34:16.413
Sure.

5857
02:34:17.140 --> 02:34:18.790
At least for these were terrified

5858
02:34:20.440 --> 02:34:20.860
there.

5859
02:34:20.860 --> 02:34:21.810
This lamp resist.

5860
02:34:21.850 --> 02:34:22.091
Okay.

5861
02:34:22.091 --> 02:34:24.250
This is ridiculous because it's saying that sharks were caught.

5862
02:34:24.251 --> 02:34:25.540
They were over 3000 pounds.

5863
02:34:25.541 --> 02:34:25.631
Yeah,

5864
02:34:25.631 --> 02:34:26.470
that's what I was thinking.

5865
02:34:26.830 --> 02:34:26.960
Yeah.

5866
02:34:26.960 --> 02:34:27.371
This is,

5867
02:34:27.371 --> 02:34:28.091
this is a,

5868
02:34:28.091 --> 02:34:29.650
were were apparently looking at it.

5869
02:34:29.680 --> 02:34:32.020
Well you probably might be rod and reel.

5870
02:34:32.110 --> 02:34:33.400
Will you read things on the Internet

5871
02:34:33.670 --> 02:34:34.503
<v 11>problem?</v>

5872
02:34:36.070 --> 02:34:36.903
Wow.

5873
02:34:37.380 --> 02:34:41.750
<v 5>What are these lampreys these they have killed Tony One.</v>

5874
02:34:42.350 --> 02:34:42.471
Yeah.

5875
02:34:42.471 --> 02:34:44.250
That's one of those things are the claims on the sharks.

5876
02:34:44.470 --> 02:34:46.770
They've killed a 21 foot,

5877
02:34:47.040 --> 02:34:48.840
eight inch great white shark.

5878
02:34:48.841 --> 02:34:50.840
That's like one of the biggest ones they killed.

5879
02:34:51.090 --> 02:34:51.901
Was that off Montauk,

5880
02:34:51.901 --> 02:34:52.590
New York?

5881
02:34:52.590 --> 02:34:53.050
I don't know.

5882
02:34:53.050 --> 02:34:53.883
I'm not sure here.

5883
02:34:54.150 --> 02:34:58.350
This is a actually even almost as big as the one in the movie jaws,

5884
02:34:58.351 --> 02:35:03.351
which was a caught by Vic hist Hislop in 1985.

5885
02:35:04.770 --> 02:35:07.530
It was the biggest great white shark ever caught.

5886
02:35:07.650 --> 02:35:09.120
So in 1985,

5887
02:35:09.510 --> 02:35:10.311
they caught the,

5888
02:35:10.311 --> 02:35:10.620
uh,

5889
02:35:10.620 --> 02:35:12.120
the biggest great white shark ever.

5890
02:35:13.190 --> 02:35:14.023
<v 11>Huh.</v>

5891
02:35:14.690 --> 02:35:15.523
Wow.

5892
02:35:17.350 --> 02:35:19.120
<v 5>Suggestive of even bigger sharks.</v>

5893
02:35:19.121 --> 02:35:21.710
He also claimed to have caught a bigger one than the one picture,

5894
02:35:21.740 --> 02:35:22.720
but he couldn't land it.

5895
02:35:22.930 --> 02:35:26.260
So he hooked a bigger one than the 21 foot one,

5896
02:35:26.590 --> 02:35:27.101
I believe.

5897
02:35:27.101 --> 02:35:27.670
I don't like that.

5898
02:35:27.670 --> 02:35:27.971
Well,

5899
02:35:27.971 --> 02:35:31.390
I was reading about it recently and apparently there's great whites are the ones

5900
02:35:31.391 --> 02:35:33.640
that do all the killing off like the coast of California.

5901
02:35:33.950 --> 02:35:35.380
They go over to Australia,

5902
02:35:35.381 --> 02:35:35.790
Hawaii,

5903
02:35:35.790 --> 02:35:36.850
they've found them ever there.

5904
02:35:36.851 --> 02:35:37.684
South Africa.

5905
02:35:37.690 --> 02:35:41.950
But there's one out in the middle of the ocean called the oceanic shark.

5906
02:35:42.460 --> 02:35:43.293
Check this out.

5907
02:35:43.690 --> 02:35:48.490
These are ones that hang out in the middle of the ocean and they're like bigger

5908
02:35:48.491 --> 02:35:49.510
than great whites.

5909
02:35:49.840 --> 02:35:50.620
Oh Jesus.

5910
02:35:50.620 --> 02:35:52.750
And they don't come to the coastal regions.

5911
02:35:52.930 --> 02:35:53.111
Well,

5912
02:35:53.111 --> 02:35:54.290
what the fuck are they are?

5913
02:35:54.330 --> 02:35:57.040
They're just a big fucking motherfucking shower oceanic.

5914
02:35:57.100 --> 02:35:57.881
They're the ones,

5915
02:35:57.881 --> 02:36:02.620
like when guys were getting shot down in World War II and their planes were like

5916
02:36:02.621 --> 02:36:03.370
out in the middle of those,

5917
02:36:03.370 --> 02:36:07.270
they're responsible for a lot of deaths because they'll clean up like a fucking

5918
02:36:07.271 --> 02:36:08.110
whole ship wreck.

5919
02:36:08.530 --> 02:36:08.801
You know,

5920
02:36:08.801 --> 02:36:09.634
they're the,

5921
02:36:10.330 --> 02:36:11.560
they're the ones that uh,

5922
02:36:12.520 --> 02:36:13.330
that the grill,

5923
02:36:13.330 --> 02:36:13.921
the great ones.

5924
02:36:13.921 --> 02:36:15.490
So the lights of the ones that are right here,

5925
02:36:15.491 --> 02:36:17.110
right off of fucking la.

5926
02:36:18.080 --> 02:36:18.480
Yeah.

5927
02:36:18.480 --> 02:36:18.820
They've,

5928
02:36:18.820 --> 02:36:20.830
they've caught whale sharks before,

5929
02:36:20.831 --> 02:36:21.221
but we'll,

5930
02:36:21.221 --> 02:36:22.720
sharks aren't the same thing.

5931
02:36:22.930 --> 02:36:23.763
Look up the OCI,

5932
02:36:24.190 --> 02:36:25.180
the oceanic shark,

5933
02:36:25.210 --> 02:36:25.840
oceanic,

5934
02:36:25.840 --> 02:36:26.350
uh,

5935
02:36:26.350 --> 02:36:28.450
I forget what it's like an oceanic white or something.

5936
02:36:28.451 --> 02:36:32.680
It's called the largest great white shark was co op Philip Island.

5937
02:36:32.681 --> 02:36:34.560
And it waited there.

5938
02:36:34.600 --> 02:36:38.050
5,085 pounds.

5939
02:36:38.080 --> 02:36:39.550
I served there a month ago,

5940
02:36:39.930 --> 02:36:40.763
capable of mine.

5941
02:36:40.800 --> 02:36:41.633
Who'd,

5942
02:36:41.800 --> 02:36:43.180
oh my God.

5943
02:36:43.630 --> 02:36:44.950
It was 20 feet,

5944
02:36:44.951 --> 02:36:48.850
eight inches long and it weighed 5,085 pounds.

5945
02:36:48.851 --> 02:36:50.440
Look at that fucking monster.

5946
02:36:51.100 --> 02:36:53.230
You look at the size of that God damn thing.

5947
02:36:53.260 --> 02:36:54.760
How scary is that bitch?

5948
02:36:55.780 --> 02:36:57.100
So oceanic shark,

5949
02:36:57.130 --> 02:36:57.950
that's what I'm looking at.

5950
02:36:57.950 --> 02:36:58.420
Yeah.

5951
02:36:58.420 --> 02:36:58.780
Yeah.

5952
02:36:58.780 --> 02:37:00.280
Phillip Island adjust surf there.

5953
02:37:00.281 --> 02:37:01.740
And they told me when we are going,

5954
02:37:01.750 --> 02:37:02.710
they said this is known,

5955
02:37:02.711 --> 02:37:03.880
it's a very sharky area.

5956
02:37:03.881 --> 02:37:04.271
And I said,

5957
02:37:04.271 --> 02:37:04.421
why?

5958
02:37:04.421 --> 02:37:06.700
They says there's a lot of water seal breeding.

5959
02:37:07.090 --> 02:37:07.990
And I went off,

5960
02:37:07.991 --> 02:37:10.540
fuck the oceanic white tips.

5961
02:37:10.541 --> 02:37:10.951
Shy.

5962
02:37:10.951 --> 02:37:11.181
Yeah.

5963
02:37:11.181 --> 02:37:12.014
Yeah.

5964
02:37:12.050 --> 02:37:12.883
Ooh,

5965
02:37:13.110 --> 02:37:16.010
creepy nature is so creepy.

5966
02:37:16.810 --> 02:37:17.960
<v 4>Why did you create this?</v>

5967
02:37:18.020 --> 02:37:19.130
Wait until you go to Alaska.

5968
02:37:19.131 --> 02:37:22.400
Gosia Muskox what does that look it up?

5969
02:37:22.910 --> 02:37:24.770
When I saw it and I'm just getting into sharks,

5970
02:37:24.830 --> 02:37:26.180
I didn't know that.

5971
02:37:26.390 --> 02:37:31.310
I didn't know that they existed and were driving down the road one day in Alaska

5972
02:37:31.640 --> 02:37:33.710
and I look over and I see this thing and I go,

5973
02:37:33.711 --> 02:37:35.030
what the fuck is that?

5974
02:37:35.031 --> 02:37:35.361
And he goes,

5975
02:37:35.361 --> 02:37:36.194
oh that's a,

5976
02:37:36.790 --> 02:37:37.480
you know like uh,

5977
02:37:37.480 --> 02:37:40.430
the research left cause I was in Fairbanks where the university is.

5978
02:37:40.640 --> 02:37:40.851
And I go,

5979
02:37:40.851 --> 02:37:40.991
no,

5980
02:37:40.991 --> 02:37:41.120
no,

5981
02:37:41.120 --> 02:37:42.000
what's that animal?

5982
02:37:42.130 --> 02:37:42.471
And he goes,

5983
02:37:42.471 --> 02:37:43.340
that's the Muskox.

5984
02:37:43.341 --> 02:37:43.701
And I go,

5985
02:37:43.701 --> 02:37:44.120
no,

5986
02:37:44.120 --> 02:37:45.770
you guys just made that up.

5987
02:37:46.280 --> 02:37:48.800
That doesn't exist in my world.

5988
02:37:49.100 --> 02:37:50.870
You made that up and it looks,

5989
02:37:50.900 --> 02:37:52.670
<v 7>it's like we've got an issue here fella.</v>

5990
02:37:52.790 --> 02:37:54.140
What does this thing is saying?

5991
02:37:54.230 --> 02:37:56.420
You might have the wrong name shark,

5992
02:37:56.720 --> 02:37:57.670
the oceanic white tips.

5993
02:37:58.210 --> 02:38:01.460
Because this is saying the largest one ever caught was only four meters,

5994
02:38:01.900 --> 02:38:02.570
which I think,

5995
02:38:02.570 --> 02:38:04.880
I think they're responsible for a lot of deaths then.

5996
02:38:04.881 --> 02:38:06.510
That's what it was that I read that they,

5997
02:38:06.660 --> 02:38:08.000
they know the ocean.

5998
02:38:08.030 --> 02:38:08.631
What the fuck?

5999
02:38:08.631 --> 02:38:09.900
That's a totally different thing you said.

6000
02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:12.110
Isn't there a bigger shark?

6001
02:38:12.111 --> 02:38:12.501
Come on.

6002
02:38:12.501 --> 02:38:14.390
Don't want you to be completely wrong here.

6003
02:38:14.500 --> 02:38:15.333
It's just sad.

6004
02:38:15.690 --> 02:38:18.680
I told me about some awesome giant shark out there and it turned well.

6005
02:38:18.790 --> 02:38:19.140
No,

6006
02:38:19.140 --> 02:38:20.600
cause I was reading about cars.

6007
02:38:20.780 --> 02:38:21.451
Which shark?

6008
02:38:21.451 --> 02:38:21.891
Somebody goes,

6009
02:38:21.891 --> 02:38:23.000
oh I saw a hammerhead Nigga.

6010
02:38:23.010 --> 02:38:25.070
They don't even kill and uh,

6011
02:38:25.370 --> 02:38:25.611
okay,

6012
02:38:25.611 --> 02:38:27.320
let's look up the largest killer sharks.

6013
02:38:27.321 --> 02:38:27.951
I was looking up.

6014
02:38:27.951 --> 02:38:29.720
Which types are the most aggressive?

6015
02:38:29.721 --> 02:38:32.480
Cause you always hear different stories or bull sharks.

6016
02:38:32.660 --> 02:38:34.400
Bull sharks are nasty tigers.

6017
02:38:34.401 --> 02:38:38.360
Makos do you know what the great bull sharks that the big thing that happened in

6018
02:38:38.361 --> 02:38:40.310
New Jersey that inspired you got the rivers?

6019
02:38:40.580 --> 02:38:41.091
Yeah.

6020
02:38:41.091 --> 02:38:43.910
They go up the river called the runners into fresh water man.

6021
02:38:44.270 --> 02:38:47.120
They found one is high north as Illinois,

6022
02:38:47.840 --> 02:38:49.700
that show monster hunter.

6023
02:38:49.701 --> 02:38:50.330
Do you remember that?

6024
02:38:50.330 --> 02:38:51.290
Or Monster Quest.

6025
02:38:51.320 --> 02:38:52.160
Did you ever see that show?

6026
02:38:52.580 --> 02:38:52.971
Yeah.

6027
02:38:52.971 --> 02:38:54.200
And in that show,

6028
02:38:54.201 --> 02:38:55.370
there's a couple of things that they,

6029
02:38:55.380 --> 02:38:56.213
um,

6030
02:38:56.450 --> 02:38:57.550
unraveled on a show.

6031
02:38:57.551 --> 02:38:58.430
It's pretty cool.

6032
02:38:58.670 --> 02:38:59.000
Um,

6033
02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:04.000
one of them was a bull sharks cause there was like a myth that sharks had gone

6034
02:39:04.131 --> 02:39:05.270
up river into freshwater,

6035
02:39:05.390 --> 02:39:05.871
like deep,

6036
02:39:05.871 --> 02:39:06.704
deep into the country.

6037
02:39:06.860 --> 02:39:09.340
But apparently bull sharks can survive in fresh water.

6038
02:39:09.500 --> 02:39:10.370
They don't prefer it,

6039
02:39:10.371 --> 02:39:11.204
but they can survive.

6040
02:39:11.230 --> 02:39:11.621
<v 4>They,</v>

6041
02:39:11.621 --> 02:39:12.454
uh,

6042
02:39:12.460 --> 02:39:14.300
they're nasty to apparently bulls.

6043
02:39:14.320 --> 02:39:15.910
They're the ones that will attack you.

6044
02:39:16.480 --> 02:39:17.260
Not,

6045
02:39:17.260 --> 02:39:18.130
not for food.

6046
02:39:19.030 --> 02:39:20.230
They're just dicks.

6047
02:39:20.840 --> 02:39:21.081
<v 7>Yeah,</v>

6048
02:39:21.081 --> 02:39:22.130
they're an evil man.

6049
02:39:22.250 --> 02:39:22.940
They're evil.

6050
02:39:22.940 --> 02:39:23.511
They're really,

6051
02:39:23.511 --> 02:39:24.770
really aggressive sharks.

6052
02:39:25.290 --> 02:39:25.700
Um,

6053
02:39:25.700 --> 02:39:27.530
what else is really tiger shark?

6054
02:39:27.660 --> 02:39:28.291
<v 4>Those are the Tigers.</v>

6055
02:39:28.291 --> 02:39:28.750
And now,

6056
02:39:28.750 --> 02:39:29.583
oh,

6057
02:39:29.610 --> 02:39:31.290
there's a video that was on the Internet.

6058
02:39:31.500 --> 02:39:31.771
Uh,

6059
02:39:31.771 --> 02:39:34.130
somebody sent me of a bunch of tigers.

6060
02:39:34.210 --> 02:39:34.530
Uh,

6061
02:39:34.530 --> 02:39:35.520
it's in Broome,

6062
02:39:35.521 --> 02:39:39.030
Australia where a whale beach like up,

6063
02:39:39.200 --> 02:39:40.800
it's like in a foot of water,

6064
02:39:41.100 --> 02:39:41.970
a foot of water.

6065
02:39:42.600 --> 02:39:46.740
And these Makos are all just eating the fuck out of it.

6066
02:39:47.430 --> 02:39:50.700
And they're flopping around in like a foot of water and you're like,

6067
02:39:50.701 --> 02:39:51.001
wow.

6068
02:39:51.001 --> 02:39:52.020
They'll go into a foot of water.

6069
02:39:52.320 --> 02:39:56.580
And these girls are all like taking pictures and stuff and they're getting too

6070
02:39:56.581 --> 02:39:58.590
close that these sharks,

6071
02:39:58.800 --> 02:40:00.930
but they're just feeding on this whale.

6072
02:40:00.931 --> 02:40:03.030
Just like eating the sides off of it.

6073
02:40:04.110 --> 02:40:04.621
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

6074
02:40:04.621 --> 02:40:05.191
I uh,

6075
02:40:05.191 --> 02:40:06.360
I've seen shit like that.

6076
02:40:06.510 --> 02:40:06.751
You know,

6077
02:40:06.751 --> 02:40:11.250
the creepiest thing I've ever seen animals feeding is a pile of Komodo dragons.

6078
02:40:11.460 --> 02:40:12.241
Have you ever seen that?

6079
02:40:12.241 --> 02:40:12.880
No.

6080
02:40:12.880 --> 02:40:13.510
Dude.

6081
02:40:13.510 --> 02:40:14.170
Got Brian

6082
02:40:14.170 --> 02:40:16.330
<v 6>Google Komodo dragons.</v>

6083
02:40:16.660 --> 02:40:19.090
A feeding frenzy because they,

6084
02:40:19.180 --> 02:40:20.013
it's like,

6085
02:40:20.260 --> 02:40:21.460
it's like walking dead.

6086
02:40:21.490 --> 02:40:22.600
Have you ever seen walking dead

6087
02:40:23.410 --> 02:40:24.670
<v 3>the movie or the TV show?</v>

6088
02:40:24.671 --> 02:40:24.890
Yeah.

6089
02:40:24.890 --> 02:40:25.071
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

6090
02:40:25.071 --> 02:40:26.000
You know how the zombies,

6091
02:40:26.510 --> 02:40:29.300
they'll collapse on a body and it's just all of them,

6092
02:40:29.301 --> 02:40:33.350
like just in a mass trying to rip this body apart and pulling chunks out.

6093
02:40:33.590 --> 02:40:34.850
Komodo dragons,

6094
02:40:34.960 --> 02:40:37.790
like this is just one image.

6095
02:40:37.791 --> 02:40:38.930
This is just a few of them.

6096
02:40:38.931 --> 02:40:40.550
This is a small group.

6097
02:40:40.760 --> 02:40:41.810
This is only three.

6098
02:40:42.100 --> 02:40:43.760
I've seen any jazz by shark attack.

6099
02:40:43.970 --> 02:40:44.620
I've seen him at,

6100
02:40:44.620 --> 02:40:44.931
yeah,

6101
02:40:44.931 --> 02:40:45.800
the Komodo dragons.

6102
02:40:45.920 --> 02:40:47.060
That's a bad way to go.

6103
02:40:47.390 --> 02:40:48.290
But Kimono dragons,

6104
02:40:48.291 --> 02:40:49.310
there's images online.

6105
02:40:49.311 --> 02:40:49.850
If you're looking at,

6106
02:40:49.850 --> 02:40:50.750
<v 3>did you ever see a fine,</v>

6107
02:40:50.751 --> 02:40:52.490
which is online shit load of them.

6108
02:40:52.550 --> 02:40:53.780
I don't know if this is fake.

6109
02:40:53.840 --> 02:40:56.900
And I know a lot of people have probably seen it and please don't send it to me

6110
02:40:56.901 --> 02:40:58.310
again cause I actually deleted it.

6111
02:40:58.340 --> 02:41:01.010
I rarely don't look at things,

6112
02:41:01.550 --> 02:41:02.241
but it was,

6113
02:41:02.241 --> 02:41:03.074
uh,

6114
02:41:03.890 --> 02:41:04.491
it was,

6115
02:41:04.491 --> 02:41:05.324
uh,

6116
02:41:05.420 --> 02:41:10.400
like a bunch of drug dealers took a guy like out into the middle of that fields,

6117
02:41:10.710 --> 02:41:13.200
<v 6>these Komodo dragons all stacked on top of them.</v>

6118
02:41:13.230 --> 02:41:13.540
There's a,

6119
02:41:13.540 --> 02:41:15.420
there's an even better one that does,

6120
02:41:15.421 --> 02:41:17.930
if you look a little further down on that Google image,

6121
02:41:17.931 --> 02:41:18.390
sure.

6122
02:41:18.390 --> 02:41:18.840
Search.

6123
02:41:18.840 --> 02:41:19.140
There's,

6124
02:41:19.140 --> 02:41:21.030
there's one a little further down.

6125
02:41:21.031 --> 02:41:22.100
It's just ridiculous.

6126
02:41:23.160 --> 02:41:24.400
I went not want to die like that.

6127
02:41:24.480 --> 02:41:24.650
Oh,

6128
02:41:24.650 --> 02:41:25.321
they're ruthless,

6129
02:41:25.321 --> 02:41:25.740
man.

6130
02:41:25.740 --> 02:41:25.891
<v 3>Well,</v>

6131
02:41:25.891 --> 02:41:26.281
these,

6132
02:41:26.281 --> 02:41:26.581
these,

6133
02:41:26.581 --> 02:41:29.670
like drug dealers took a guy out into the middle of this field.

6134
02:41:29.940 --> 02:41:30.050
Now,

6135
02:41:30.050 --> 02:41:31.290
I don't know what they did do them.

6136
02:41:31.350 --> 02:41:32.190
I think they,

6137
02:41:33.690 --> 02:41:35.370
I don't know if they'd be head up first,

6138
02:41:35.760 --> 02:41:40.050
but then these vultures come and just pick away at his body.

6139
02:41:40.051 --> 02:41:43.680
And it's a series of photos showing you the beginning to the end.

6140
02:41:43.710 --> 02:41:45.210
And it's just a skeleton.

6141
02:41:45.610 --> 02:41:47.800
<v 6>Have you ever seen those two veins,</v>

6142
02:41:47.801 --> 02:41:48.670
Guy Funerals?

6143
02:41:49.120 --> 02:41:50.500
It's a actually a religious thing.

6144
02:41:50.501 --> 02:41:50.950
It's no,

6145
02:41:50.950 --> 02:41:51.131
no,

6146
02:41:51.131 --> 02:41:51.281
no.

6147
02:41:51.281 --> 02:41:52.420
He's talking about different things.

6148
02:41:52.421 --> 02:41:53.350
He's talking about people.

6149
02:41:53.351 --> 02:41:53.680
There's,

6150
02:41:53.680 --> 02:41:54.513
there's two ones.

6151
02:41:54.680 --> 02:41:54.950
You're,

6152
02:41:54.950 --> 02:41:55.780
what you're talking about,

6153
02:41:55.780 --> 02:41:59.740
the Tibetans sky funeral when he's talking about is them torturing and killing

6154
02:41:59.741 --> 02:42:01.390
somebody and leaving their body to vultures.

6155
02:42:01.510 --> 02:42:03.070
But there's two different things.

6156
02:42:03.310 --> 02:42:05.160
What's the Tibetan SkyFii enroll?

6157
02:42:05.220 --> 02:42:06.610
The people do it to people they love.

6158
02:42:07.060 --> 02:42:07.510
Oh Great.

6159
02:42:07.510 --> 02:42:11.350
Take their body when they die and they cut it up and they feed it to vultures

6160
02:42:11.590 --> 02:42:13.000
and they actually filmed it.

6161
02:42:13.690 --> 02:42:16.390
They filmed it and take photographs of it and the people request it.

6162
02:42:16.420 --> 02:42:16.781
They said,

6163
02:42:16.781 --> 02:42:16.961
look,

6164
02:42:16.961 --> 02:42:17.770
if I die,

6165
02:42:17.770 --> 02:42:20.530
I want you to feed me to the vultures because at least then you know,

6166
02:42:20.531 --> 02:42:21.400
your body goes,

6167
02:42:21.430 --> 02:42:23.860
it's used for something and they go hardcore with it.

6168
02:42:23.861 --> 02:42:26.170
They smash up the skull after the,

6169
02:42:26.410 --> 02:42:26.741
the,

6170
02:42:26.741 --> 02:42:27.430
uh,

6171
02:42:27.430 --> 02:42:28.810
vultures go through the body.

6172
02:42:28.990 --> 02:42:30.010
They smashed up the skull.

6173
02:42:30.011 --> 02:42:31.420
So the vulture eats that too.

6174
02:42:31.870 --> 02:42:32.651
Don't Google image,

6175
02:42:32.651 --> 02:42:33.140
search it.

6176
02:42:33.140 --> 02:42:34.000
Scratch Google image.

6177
02:42:34.001 --> 02:42:34.834
Search it.

6178
02:42:34.840 --> 02:42:35.280
Hold up.

6179
02:42:35.280 --> 02:42:36.090
Well do that.

6180
02:42:36.090 --> 02:42:37.470
<v 3>Did you have Kenny Hotz on your show,</v>

6181
02:42:37.830 --> 02:42:38.730
Kenny versus spending?

6182
02:42:38.790 --> 02:42:39.270
No.

6183
02:42:39.270 --> 02:42:39.540
No.

6184
02:42:39.540 --> 02:42:42.330
Comedy central show that used to be on the air where they compete against each

6185
02:42:42.331 --> 02:42:42.560
other.

6186
02:42:42.560 --> 02:42:42.810
Yeah.

6187
02:42:42.810 --> 02:42:43.230
No,

6188
02:42:43.230 --> 02:42:44.220
I had him on my show.

6189
02:42:45.090 --> 02:42:46.800
He some fucking maniac.

6190
02:42:47.070 --> 02:42:48.360
He on one of his shows.

6191
02:42:48.361 --> 02:42:49.410
He does all these crazy shows.

6192
02:42:49.560 --> 02:42:51.030
He ate a human body.

6193
02:42:51.570 --> 02:42:52.080
What?

6194
02:42:52.080 --> 02:42:52.830
Yes.

6195
02:42:52.830 --> 02:42:53.521
He had a,

6196
02:42:53.521 --> 02:42:54.690
they grinded up teeth.

6197
02:42:54.691 --> 02:42:56.860
He eight teeth skin.

6198
02:42:57.160 --> 02:42:57.660
Uh,

6199
02:42:57.660 --> 02:42:58.980
he's a maniac.

6200
02:42:59.010 --> 02:43:00.270
He's a hilarious guy.

6201
02:43:00.720 --> 02:43:01.770
Why would he do that?

6202
02:43:01.810 --> 02:43:02.730
Because he's crazy.

6203
02:43:02.850 --> 02:43:03.180
Ooh,

6204
02:43:03.180 --> 02:43:07.050
watch the watch the watch some of the youtube videos versus penny.

6205
02:43:07.230 --> 02:43:10.710
He had this one that they always compete against each other and one was who can

6206
02:43:10.711 --> 02:43:11.560
eat more meat

6207
02:43:12.400 --> 02:43:14.600
<v 4>and he was grinding up meat and making meat shake.</v>

6208
02:43:14.610 --> 02:43:14.780
Yeah.

6209
02:43:14.780 --> 02:43:17.960
<v 7>This is the Benton's sky funeral and there's worse where it just seems like a</v>

6210
02:43:17.961 --> 02:43:20.080
side view of a person's face is just this morning,

6211
02:43:20.140 --> 02:43:20.680
this guy,

6212
02:43:20.680 --> 02:43:21.680
they tie him down too,

6213
02:43:21.681 --> 02:43:23.150
so the vultures can't carry him off,

6214
02:43:23.151 --> 02:43:24.500
so they have to finish it right there.

6215
02:43:25.280 --> 02:43:26.031
Time down.

6216
02:43:26.031 --> 02:43:26.930
The vultures go through them,

6217
02:43:26.970 --> 02:43:27.803
then they

6218
02:43:28.910 --> 02:43:29.743
fall on me.

6219
02:43:29.930 --> 02:43:31.550
They have a whole bunch of them come down to,

6220
02:43:31.551 --> 02:43:31.851
but no,

6221
02:43:31.851 --> 02:43:32.630
you're already dead.

6222
02:43:32.630 --> 02:43:33.310
And I'm like,

6223
02:43:33.310 --> 02:43:33.850
yeah,

6224
02:43:33.850 --> 02:43:34.850
well I still,

6225
02:43:35.150 --> 02:43:36.410
some people want to die that way.

6226
02:43:36.411 --> 02:43:38.810
They want it or they want to be dealt with.

6227
02:43:38.840 --> 02:43:39.201
They want,

6228
02:43:39.201 --> 02:43:40.520
their corpse would be dealt with that way.

6229
02:43:40.750 --> 02:43:42.340
It might as well make it a spectacle to,

6230
02:43:42.360 --> 02:43:42.501
well,

6231
02:43:42.501 --> 02:43:42.681
well,

6232
02:43:42.681 --> 02:43:43.401
the way we do it,

6233
02:43:43.401 --> 02:43:47.690
it's really weird when we poisoned the body so that nature can't consume it,

6234
02:43:47.830 --> 02:43:49.730
not it need it nearly as easily.

6235
02:43:49.850 --> 02:43:54.230
So it's like you could book dig someone out of a hole has been there for like a

6236
02:43:54.230 --> 02:43:54.260
year,

6237
02:43:54.260 --> 02:43:55.093
like taxidermy.

6238
02:43:55.410 --> 02:43:55.790
Well,

6239
02:43:55.790 --> 02:43:56.990
when you watch that show,

6240
02:43:56.991 --> 02:43:58.340
like those autonomies shows,

6241
02:43:58.341 --> 02:44:00.620
autopsy shows where they have to exume bodies,

6242
02:44:00.900 --> 02:44:04.220
a lot of times they're doing it and the person's a fucking year plus in the hole

6243
02:44:04.460 --> 02:44:05.660
and their body's still there.

6244
02:44:05.750 --> 02:44:06.171
You know,

6245
02:44:06.171 --> 02:44:08.570
because you formaldehyde the shit out of it.

6246
02:44:08.571 --> 02:44:09.370
And well,

6247
02:44:09.370 --> 02:44:09.520
the,

6248
02:44:09.520 --> 02:44:11.660
the funeral to the open casket funeral,

6249
02:44:11.690 --> 02:44:13.350
I don't think there's anything creepier who,

6250
02:44:13.351 --> 02:44:14.184
it's weird.

6251
02:44:14.210 --> 02:44:15.043
I don't know.

6252
02:44:15.440 --> 02:44:16.790
I don't know why anyone does.

6253
02:44:16.791 --> 02:44:17.810
Have you had anyone,

6254
02:44:17.811 --> 02:44:18.644
you know,

6255
02:44:19.470 --> 02:44:20.860
I grew up Catholic and they,

6256
02:44:20.870 --> 02:44:21.950
they do that and I'm like,

6257
02:44:21.951 --> 02:44:22.784
stop.

6258
02:44:22.850 --> 02:44:25.220
How many of you been to a lot?

6259
02:44:26.060 --> 02:44:26.391
Yeah,

6260
02:44:26.391 --> 02:44:27.450
that's fucking gross.

6261
02:44:27.451 --> 02:44:28.220
It's so gross.

6262
02:44:28.220 --> 02:44:29.630
It's weird that it's the standard,

6263
02:44:29.631 --> 02:44:29.871
you know,

6264
02:44:29.871 --> 02:44:32.540
I'm pretty sure they make you embalm someone even if you're going to cremate

6265
02:44:32.541 --> 02:44:33.070
him.

6266
02:44:33.070 --> 02:44:33.570
Really?

6267
02:44:33.570 --> 02:44:34.370
I think so.

6268
02:44:34.370 --> 02:44:35.121
I think they take,

6269
02:44:35.121 --> 02:44:36.950
I don't think that like goes straight cremation,

6270
02:44:36.980 --> 02:44:37.340
right?

6271
02:44:37.340 --> 02:44:38.180
Isn't that the case?

6272
02:44:38.450 --> 02:44:38.691
No,

6273
02:44:38.691 --> 02:44:39.524
I don't think so.

6274
02:44:39.740 --> 02:44:40.011
Okay.

6275
02:44:40.011 --> 02:44:40.730
I think you're wrong.

6276
02:44:40.730 --> 02:44:41.211
I think,

6277
02:44:41.211 --> 02:44:41.500
uh,

6278
02:44:41.500 --> 02:44:42.051
I get creeped out.

6279
02:44:42.051 --> 02:44:42.740
I'm pretty sure.

6280
02:44:42.740 --> 02:44:45.470
I'm pretty sure it changes Joey Dee and my friend.

6281
02:44:45.500 --> 02:44:47.150
That is actually an undertaking.

6282
02:44:47.680 --> 02:44:49.120
<v 4>They might drain the blood,</v>

6283
02:44:49.150 --> 02:44:50.940
but they probably don't replace it with them.

6284
02:44:50.960 --> 02:44:52.500
You know how they drained the path today?

6285
02:44:53.050 --> 02:44:55.420
I think they have two percentage and they put them on the table,

6286
02:44:55.930 --> 02:44:56.231
uh,

6287
02:44:56.231 --> 02:44:57.041
to drain the blood.

6288
02:44:57.041 --> 02:44:58.060
I don't know what I'm talking about.

6289
02:44:58.061 --> 02:44:58.181
This,

6290
02:44:58.181 --> 02:44:59.014
I hate this shit.

6291
02:44:59.350 --> 02:45:01.270
They cause there's a story.

6292
02:45:01.620 --> 02:45:02.920
I got a friend of mine at job,

6293
02:45:03.280 --> 02:45:03.850
uh,

6294
02:45:03.850 --> 02:45:04.631
at a funeral home.

6295
02:45:04.631 --> 02:45:08.350
I knew a funeral director and I got this guy job when we were in college and

6296
02:45:09.190 --> 02:45:12.280
he's Jewish and he had never been to Jewish funerals.

6297
02:45:12.281 --> 02:45:13.114
They don't do that.

6298
02:45:13.390 --> 02:45:14.223
Uh,

6299
02:45:14.320 --> 02:45:15.310
he went to the funeral home.

6300
02:45:15.311 --> 02:45:16.144
He was working there,

6301
02:45:16.150 --> 02:45:17.140
washing cars,

6302
02:45:17.170 --> 02:45:19.060
watching the hearse and the limos and everything.

6303
02:45:19.480 --> 02:45:22.150
One day the guys that he worked with the first day said,

6304
02:45:22.151 --> 02:45:22.301
hey,

6305
02:45:22.301 --> 02:45:24.370
go in that room and get some more sponges.

6306
02:45:24.880 --> 02:45:25.661
He goes in the room,

6307
02:45:25.661 --> 02:45:29.470
it's the embalming room and there's a body on the table and they cut them at

6308
02:45:29.471 --> 02:45:31.240
like the wrists and the ankles I think,

6309
02:45:31.600 --> 02:45:33.940
and just let the risks and like legs hang.

6310
02:45:34.360 --> 02:45:35.193
And so all the body,

6311
02:45:35.350 --> 02:45:37.830
all the blood drips and the floors,

6312
02:45:37.840 --> 02:45:41.800
like a graded floor that just catches all the blood underneath,

6313
02:45:41.801 --> 02:45:41.951
you know,

6314
02:45:41.951 --> 02:45:43.330
and there's drains underneath.

6315
02:45:43.420 --> 02:45:46.480
So he walks in the room and sees them.

6316
02:45:47.470 --> 02:45:51.220
She sees this body and just fucking loses it and run to quits.

6317
02:45:51.221 --> 02:45:52.680
The job doesn't even go to

6318
02:45:52.780 --> 02:45:54.850
<v 7>pick up his check one day he was like,</v>

6319
02:45:54.851 --> 02:45:55.150
fuck,

6320
02:45:55.150 --> 02:45:55.983
that's haunting.

6321
02:45:56.080 --> 02:45:57.160
Here's the answer to that.

6322
02:45:57.460 --> 02:46:00.610
There's no state law that says the body must be embalmed before cremation.

6323
02:46:00.640 --> 02:46:01.780
It's a bit more complicated.

6324
02:46:01.781 --> 02:46:03.700
Some states require that a body to be burned,

6325
02:46:03.970 --> 02:46:04.260
uh,

6326
02:46:04.260 --> 02:46:04.781
buried,

6327
02:46:04.781 --> 02:46:07.720
cremated embalmed or refrigerated within a certain amount of time.

6328
02:46:07.930 --> 02:46:09.990
So what happens is that

6329
02:46:10.410 --> 02:46:11.760
<v 6>funeral homes will rip you off.</v>

6330
02:46:12.120 --> 02:46:15.840
And then if you say that you want to get the body cremated,

6331
02:46:15.870 --> 02:46:18.300
if they get ahold of it before,

6332
02:46:18.301 --> 02:46:18.541
you know,

6333
02:46:18.541 --> 02:46:18.780
like,

6334
02:46:18.780 --> 02:46:19.261
you know what I mean?

6335
02:46:19.261 --> 02:46:19.930
It gets brought,

6336
02:46:19.930 --> 02:46:21.510
someone's body gets brought to a funeral home.

6337
02:46:21.810 --> 02:46:22.770
If that happens,

6338
02:46:22.830 --> 02:46:25.260
a lot of times they try to sell you on embalming.

6339
02:46:25.261 --> 02:46:27.180
The person before cremation,

6340
02:46:27.181 --> 02:46:28.830
they just tell you that it has to be done.

6341
02:46:28.920 --> 02:46:29.970
But it doesn't have to be that.

6342
02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:30.320
Yeah,

6343
02:46:30.320 --> 02:46:31.153
apparently.

6344
02:46:31.170 --> 02:46:32.190
Apparently like that's like,

6345
02:46:32.580 --> 02:46:36.450
like there's a lot of money and taking care of dead bodies because people are

6346
02:46:36.451 --> 02:46:38.370
forced to do something about it.

6347
02:46:38.490 --> 02:46:39.930
You can't just bury your friends.

6348
02:46:40.230 --> 02:46:41.063
You're not allowed to.

6349
02:46:41.290 --> 02:46:42.091
It's not legal.

6350
02:46:42.091 --> 02:46:43.500
You can't just like say,

6351
02:46:43.501 --> 02:46:43.771
you know,

6352
02:46:43.771 --> 02:46:44.161
hey,

6353
02:46:44.161 --> 02:46:44.581
you know,

6354
02:46:44.581 --> 02:46:45.150
uh,

6355
02:46:45.150 --> 02:46:46.350
Bobby died in a car accident.

6356
02:46:46.351 --> 02:46:48.750
Do you mind if we take him and I want to put them in my backyard behind the

6357
02:46:48.751 --> 02:46:49.584
apple tree.

6358
02:46:50.990 --> 02:46:52.980
Can't bury your friend and your yard.

6359
02:46:53.160 --> 02:46:57.930
It has to be in a funeral home or whether it has to be a in a mortuary,

6360
02:46:57.980 --> 02:46:58.860
whatever,

6361
02:46:59.140 --> 02:46:59.700
you know,

6362
02:46:59.700 --> 02:47:00.750
it's gotta be a cemetery.

6363
02:47:01.020 --> 02:47:01.740
You gotta be,

6364
02:47:01.740 --> 02:47:02.220
you know,

6365
02:47:02.220 --> 02:47:03.870
it's gotta be taken care of in a certain way.

6366
02:47:03.990 --> 02:47:04.980
You can't just throw him in the hole,

6367
02:47:04.981 --> 02:47:06.690
you have to embalm him before you throw them in the hall.

6368
02:47:06.700 --> 02:47:07.620
I think for the most part,

6369
02:47:08.060 --> 02:47:08.893
you know

6370
02:47:09.930 --> 02:47:11.870
<v 4>Costco sells a cast,</v>

6371
02:47:12.130 --> 02:47:16.530
so does Amazon and blue wow task.

6372
02:47:16.740 --> 02:47:20.240
It's never understand that either the amount of money that's put into them too,

6373
02:47:20.241 --> 02:47:22.250
like you know the deluxe bottle,

6374
02:47:22.251 --> 02:47:24.860
then you're putting it in the dirt in an hour.

6375
02:47:25.480 --> 02:47:26.710
<v 6>Get it if you want to.</v>

6376
02:47:26.711 --> 02:47:27.070
I mean,

6377
02:47:27.070 --> 02:47:28.630
how much do people spend on their weddings?

6378
02:47:28.660 --> 02:47:28.991
You know,

6379
02:47:28.991 --> 02:47:30.700
some people have these crazy million dollars.

6380
02:47:30.701 --> 02:47:30.780
Yeah.

6381
02:47:30.780 --> 02:47:31.613
<v 4>Weddings.</v>

6382
02:47:31.790 --> 02:47:32.430
There's a,

6383
02:47:32.430 --> 02:47:33.270
there's a coffin.

6384
02:47:33.271 --> 02:47:33.601
It's like,

6385
02:47:33.601 --> 02:47:35.160
look at the size of a boy.

6386
02:47:35.310 --> 02:47:36.143
Oh God.

6387
02:47:36.340 --> 02:47:36.530
Okay.

6388
02:47:36.530 --> 02:47:37.363
That's,

6389
02:47:37.650 --> 02:47:39.360
that is fucking depressing.

6390
02:47:40.290 --> 02:47:44.850
Shut that off to watch the Brazilian prank show where the coffin is in the

6391
02:47:44.910 --> 02:47:45.743
elevator.

6392
02:47:45.870 --> 02:47:46.380
No,

6393
02:47:46.380 --> 02:47:47.730
it's the same one where,

6394
02:47:47.760 --> 02:47:48.410
uh,

6395
02:47:48.410 --> 02:47:48.991
where the little,

6396
02:47:48.991 --> 02:47:50.510
which comes out of the fuck.

6397
02:47:51.550 --> 02:47:53.530
That's a fucking great show.

6398
02:47:53.531 --> 02:47:55.020
So fucking great.

6399
02:47:55.230 --> 02:47:56.490
The best prank ever.

6400
02:47:56.710 --> 02:47:59.760
You're in there in the elevator and uh,

6401
02:47:59.910 --> 02:48:01.290
the lights go off in the elevator.

6402
02:48:01.470 --> 02:48:04.590
They got a camera in there and then a girl.

6403
02:48:04.770 --> 02:48:04.861
Oh,

6404
02:48:04.861 --> 02:48:05.311
don't tell me.

6405
02:48:05.311 --> 02:48:05.671
Don't tell me.

6406
02:48:05.671 --> 02:48:06.150
I'll watch it.

6407
02:48:06.150 --> 02:48:06.650
I'll watch it.

6408
02:48:06.650 --> 02:48:07.150
Awesome.

6409
02:48:07.150 --> 02:48:08.070
I'll watch it online.

6410
02:48:08.130 --> 02:48:08.963
I'll watch it online.

6411
02:48:08.970 --> 02:48:10.560
Watch the one with the casket.

6412
02:48:10.590 --> 02:48:11.041
What's it called?

6413
02:48:11.041 --> 02:48:14.640

It's amazing to watch it for hours.

6417
02:48:18.620 --> 02:48:18.930
Yes.

6418
02:48:18.930 --> 02:48:19.201
Yes.

6419
02:48:19.201 --> 02:48:19.700

6420
02:48:19.700 --> 02:48:19.911

no.

6426
02:48:20.491 --> 02:48:21.324
I don't want to watch it.

6427
02:48:21.670 --> 02:48:22.200
Um,

6428
02:48:22.200 --> 02:48:22.471
I'm a,

6429
02:48:22.471 --> 02:48:23.520

<v 4>You enjoy it.</v>

6431
02:48:25.830 --> 02:48:26.663
Have a good time.

6432
02:48:26.910 --> 02:48:27.780
Uh,

6433
02:48:27.830 --> 02:48:28.241
that's it.

6434
02:48:28.241 --> 02:48:28.301
Uh,

6435
02:48:28.301 --> 02:48:31.860
do you have anything to add to the powerful Twitter man in the world?

6436
02:48:31.861 --> 02:48:32.161
Twitter.

6437
02:48:32.161 --> 02:48:32.994
Me

6438
02:48:34.480 --> 02:48:35.940
15 can't get Twitter followers.

6439
02:48:35.941 --> 02:48:38.220
I think it's some spelling my name or that I don't Twitter.

6440
02:48:38.221 --> 02:48:41.010
Do you mean what's the matter of 16,000?

6441
02:48:41.820 --> 02:48:42.630
That's how dare you.

6442
02:48:42.630 --> 02:48:43.081
I know.

6443
02:48:43.081 --> 02:48:43.950
It's ridiculous.

6444
02:48:44.040 --> 02:48:46.530
<v 6>Dare you fucking around over in Australia.</v>

6445
02:48:46.870 --> 02:48:47.790
I don't use Twitter over there.

6446
02:48:47.840 --> 02:48:49.130
<v 4>They don't do,</v>

6447
02:48:49.131 --> 02:48:50.060
they're not some people,

6448
02:48:50.061 --> 02:48:51.020
it's not as big.

6449
02:48:51.720 --> 02:48:53.390
It's not bigger than a lot of places too.

6450
02:48:53.391 --> 02:48:55.760
Like I notice a lot of people from Texas don't use,

6451
02:48:55.890 --> 02:48:56.723
<v 6>so you're out of your mind.</v>

6452
02:48:56.750 --> 02:48:58.060
Texas is flooded with Twitter.

6453
02:48:58.240 --> 02:49:02.800
Austin south by southwest is a huge fucking Twitter destination from Houston.

6454
02:49:02.801 --> 02:49:03.700
Doesn't do it for something.

6455
02:49:03.870 --> 02:49:04.390
Really?

6456
02:49:04.390 --> 02:49:04.730
Yeah,

6457
02:49:04.730 --> 02:49:05.260
I don't know.

6458
02:49:05.260 --> 02:49:06.820
I think a lot of folks like regular,

6459
02:49:07.330 --> 02:49:08.230
they don't want to do it.

6460
02:49:08.260 --> 02:49:09.120
I mean for Comedians.

6461
02:49:09.121 --> 02:49:10.150
So it's gigantic.

6462
02:49:10.630 --> 02:49:11.171
Facebook,

6463
02:49:11.171 --> 02:49:11.850

6464
02:49:11.850 --> 02:49:12.191
