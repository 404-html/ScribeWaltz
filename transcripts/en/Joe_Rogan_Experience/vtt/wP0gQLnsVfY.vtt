00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.650
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.180
<v Speaker 1>I do bad shows.</v>

3
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:04.290
<v Speaker 1>If I'm hung over,</v>

4
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't like my shows.</v>

5
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:06.780
<v Speaker 1>They don't feel good.</v>

6
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.550
<v Speaker 1>They don't have the flow to them,</v>

7
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:09.331
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

8
00:00:09.331 --> 00:00:10.180
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

9
00:00:10.181 --> 00:00:10.801
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

10
00:00:10.801 --> 00:00:11.940
<v Speaker 1>I hate that feeling.</v>

11
00:00:11.941 --> 00:00:14.540
<v Speaker 1>I hate the feeling of being on stage and it's,</v>

12
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.000
<v Speaker 1>it would be my fault if I was hung over if I was hung over on seats.</v>

13
00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:18.240
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

14
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.380
<v Speaker 1>it's my fault that I'm working at like three quarter speed right now or it's not</v>

15
00:00:22.381 --> 00:00:23.191
<v Speaker 1>clicking right now.</v>

16
00:00:23.191 --> 00:00:24.190
<v Speaker 1>Like that's so,</v>

17
00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.540
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

18
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:24.661
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

19
00:00:24.661 --> 00:00:26.070
<v Speaker 2>I wish I could just have one,</v>

20
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.600
<v Speaker 2>but it's not satisfying because you have one and then you want a hundred and,</v>

21
00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:30.210
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>

22
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.520
<v Speaker 2>and then you drink a hundred and then you feel like shit.</v>

23
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.650
<v Speaker 2>And like if I just drink one,</v>

24
00:00:34.651 --> 00:00:36.000
<v Speaker 2>like I've have one at lunch,</v>

25
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.610
<v Speaker 2>then it's like I want to go take a nap.</v>

26
00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.950
<v Speaker 2>If I either got to keep going,</v>

27
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:41.970
<v Speaker 2>if I keep going,</v>

28
00:00:41.971 --> 00:00:42.840
<v Speaker 2>I can go for like,</v>

29
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:43.763
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

30
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.780
<v Speaker 2>a good hardcore for,</v>

31
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.640
<v Speaker 2>or a gentleman six</v>

32
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.633
<v Speaker 2>and then I'm done.</v>

33
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.871
<v Speaker 2>But like,</v>

34
00:00:51.871 --> 00:00:52.704
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

35
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:53.221
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

36
00:00:53.221 --> 00:00:54.054
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

37
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.440
<v Speaker 2>I feel pulled to it.</v>

38
00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.330
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

39
00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:58.740
<v Speaker 1>Is it like Gollum in the ring?</v>

40
00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:59.051
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

41
00:00:59.051 --> 00:00:59.351
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

42
00:00:59.351 --> 00:01:00.184
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what that means.</v>

43
00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.023
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

44
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:02.200
<v Speaker 2>I just like,</v>

45
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.461
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

46
00:01:03.461 --> 00:01:03.671
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

47
00:01:03.671 --> 00:01:04.490
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

48
00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:05.323
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

49
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.550
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know what that is.</v>

50
00:01:09.551 --> 00:01:11.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to see the Lord of the rings.</v>

51
00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:12.880
<v Speaker 2>You didn't see the Lord of the rings.</v>

52
00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.780
<v Speaker 2>I went to one of those and it was so fucking long and every time they wouldn't,</v>

53
00:01:16.781 --> 00:01:18.100
<v Speaker 2>they would fade to black.</v>

54
00:01:18.101 --> 00:01:18.611
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>

55
00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:19.570
<v Speaker 2>just roll the credits,</v>

56
00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.153
<v Speaker 2>roll the credits,</v>

57
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.730
<v Speaker 2>and then they would open up on some big field and it's just like Jesus,</v>

58
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.210
<v Speaker 2>get the fucking thing back to the guy so we can get out of here.</v>

59
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.800
<v Speaker 2>I hate,</v>

60
00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:30.041
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

61
00:01:30.041 --> 00:01:30.341
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

62
00:01:30.341 --> 00:01:33.970
<v Speaker 2>I fucking hate all of them and I fucking paid,</v>

63
00:01:33.971 --> 00:01:37.300
<v Speaker 2>people don't have a sense of humor about the bullshit that they watched when</v>

64
00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:38.793
<v Speaker 2>they were kids.</v>

65
00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.230
<v Speaker 2>Like adults who talk about star wars,</v>

66
00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.430
<v Speaker 2>like that isn't a fucking movie now when you watch it,</v>

67
00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean like how busy,</v>

68
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:47.763
<v Speaker 2>terrible.</v>

69
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.050
<v Speaker 2>I was making fun of the other night.</v>

70
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.240
<v Speaker 2>The other night I came home,</v>

71
00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.900
<v Speaker 2>I got,</v>

72
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:53.920
<v Speaker 2>I got free,</v>

73
00:01:53.921 --> 00:01:54.160
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

74

<v Speaker 2>free Cinemax,</v>

75
00:01:55.031 --> 00:01:56.770

<v Speaker 2>They either 24 hours a day.</v>

77
00:01:58.631 --> 00:02:02.230
<v Speaker 2>They're either showing the greatest movie ever or the worst fucking movie ever.</v>

78
00:02:02.231 --> 00:02:05.680
<v Speaker 2>And it's all compelling as I watch like nine movies in a row,</v>

79
00:02:05.681 --> 00:02:06.670
<v Speaker 2>like this fucking channels.</v>

80
00:02:06.671 --> 00:02:07.504
<v Speaker 2>Unbelievable.</v>

81
00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.030
<v Speaker 2>So I ended up flipping up,</v>

82
00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.953
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

83
00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:12.191

85
00:02:13.091 --> 00:02:13.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

86
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.111
<v Speaker 2>softcore porn,</v>

87
00:02:14.111 --> 00:02:15.760
<v Speaker 2>which is ridiculous now when you have the Internet.</v>

88
00:02:15.761 --> 00:02:16.750
<v Speaker 2>So just was redundant.</v>

89
00:02:16.751 --> 00:02:16.961
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>

90
00:02:16.961 --> 00:02:17.794
<v Speaker 2>I got off of that.</v>

91
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.270
<v Speaker 2>So I went on to VH one.</v>

92
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.080
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

93
00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.460
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

94
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.670
<v Speaker 2>and they were playing this show metal mania and I was watching all these bands</v>

95
00:02:24.671 --> 00:02:27.670
<v Speaker 2>in these videos that I just thought were fucking sick and they were injured.</v>

96
00:02:27.671 --> 00:02:28.151
<v Speaker 2>The devil,</v>

97
00:02:28.151 --> 00:02:28.840
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

98
00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:29.870
<v Speaker 2>I was just by the NFL.</v>

99
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:30.131
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

100
00:02:30.131 --> 00:02:31.600
<v Speaker 2>how is this better than disco?</v>

101
00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.940
<v Speaker 2>Like why did disco gets so much shit?</v>

102
00:02:33.941 --> 00:02:36.730
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm not talking about like the iron maidens and metallic Metallica's,</v>

103
00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.290
<v Speaker 2>but you know what I'm talking about?</v>

104
00:02:38.291 --> 00:02:39.640
<v Speaker 2>That middle of the fucking ground,</v>

105
00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.790
<v Speaker 2>those people with the spiked fucking gloves and all this stupid shit and rom</v>

106
00:02:45.041 --> 00:02:46.090
<v Speaker 2>meat and it was just,</v>

107
00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.530
<v Speaker 2>it was horse shit.</v>

108
00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:48.690
<v Speaker 2>It was fucking,</v>

109
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:49.451
<v Speaker 2>I watched it.</v>

110
00:02:49.451 --> 00:02:50.680
<v Speaker 2>It was the dumbest shit ever.</v>

111
00:02:50.681 --> 00:02:51.730
<v Speaker 2>It was embarrassing that I,</v>

112
00:02:51.731 --> 00:02:52.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

113
00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.860
<v Speaker 2>I moved,</v>

114
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.080
<v Speaker 2>granted I had all of that music still on my iPod.</v>

115
00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.471
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

116
00:02:56.471 --> 00:02:56.891
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

117
00:02:56.891 --> 00:02:57.724
<v Speaker 2>I'm not above it.</v>

118
00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:58.640
<v Speaker 2>But if someone were,</v>

119
00:02:58.641 --> 00:03:01.930
<v Speaker 2>were from this generation would have come back and tell me that music was awful</v>

120
00:03:01.931 --> 00:03:02.764
<v Speaker 2>and it was stupid.</v>

121
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:03.670
<v Speaker 2>I would laugh.</v>

122
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:04.031
<v Speaker 2>There's like,</v>

123
00:03:04.031 --> 00:03:05.620
<v Speaker 2>there's no way I could defend it.</v>

124
00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.000
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it weird how you look at,</v>

125
00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.200
<v Speaker 1>like if you look at music or you look at movies,</v>

126
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.800
<v Speaker 1>that's like one of the clearest examples of like some sort of a evolution or</v>

127
00:03:16.471 --> 00:03:19.780
<v Speaker 1>progress is going on with humans because like the,</v>

128
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.240
<v Speaker 1>the movies of the past,</v>

129
00:03:21.241 --> 00:03:25.200
<v Speaker 1>like so many of them are there are so clunky and the,</v>

130
00:03:25.201 --> 00:03:25.391
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

131
00:03:25.391 --> 00:03:25.651
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

132
00:03:25.651 --> 00:03:25.891
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

133
00:03:25.891 --> 00:03:29.160
<v Speaker 1>the style of communicating is so artificial.</v>

134
00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.143
<v Speaker 1>It looks,</v>

135
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.971
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

136
00:03:30.971 --> 00:03:32.400
<v Speaker 1>it's such a shit,</v>

137
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

138
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.740
<v Speaker 1>representation of life</v>

139
00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.930
<v Speaker 2>in comparison to a real good mood until the 60 once they figured out,</v>

140
00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:40.243
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

141
00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.730
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

142
00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:41.870
<v Speaker 2>just acting on film,</v>

143
00:03:41.871 --> 00:03:43.550
<v Speaker 2>like those people just learning how to do it.</v>

144
00:03:43.551 --> 00:03:44.361
<v Speaker 2>So everything was,</v>

145
00:03:44.361 --> 00:03:44.760
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

146
00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:45.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

147
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:50.100
<v Speaker 2>gonna be not like that type of acting had to go away with the Brando's and the</v>

148
00:03:51.471 --> 00:03:52.251
