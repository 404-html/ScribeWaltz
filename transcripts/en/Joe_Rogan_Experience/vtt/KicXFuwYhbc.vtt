00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.880
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.230
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

3
00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:05.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean people ask me like why would they want to be on TV?</v>

4
00:00:05.611 --> 00:00:07.530
<v Speaker 1>Cause everybody wants to be on TV.</v>

5
00:00:07.531 --> 00:00:10.530
<v Speaker 1>Like we talked to a bunch of different clan groups and are they,</v>

6
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.393
<v Speaker 1>the producers did,</v>

7
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.920
<v Speaker 1>most of them didn't want to be on TV but there was like three or four that did</v>

8
00:00:13.921 --> 00:00:14.610
<v Speaker 1>cause they,</v>

9
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.230
<v Speaker 1>they thought they were spreading the word.</v>

10
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.280
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they were,</v>

11
00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:18.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

12
00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.430
<v Speaker 1>what was their message like when you were talking to them?</v>

13
00:00:20.431 --> 00:00:20.900
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>

14
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.220
<v Speaker 1>what was the reason for them doing this?</v>

15
00:00:23.221 --> 00:00:26.160
<v Speaker 1>They believe America is a white country ordained by God.</v>

16
00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:28.320
<v Speaker 1>That way they believe the Bible says that's true.</v>

17
00:00:28.321 --> 00:00:29.930
<v Speaker 1>They believe the Bible talks about a man.</v>

18
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:30.961
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>

19
00:00:30.961 --> 00:00:31.440
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

20
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm not telling you what I believe,</v>

21
00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:37.110
<v Speaker 1>but they believed that the Bible doesn't think that the racist should mix.</v>

22
00:00:37.111 --> 00:00:37.950
<v Speaker 1>The Bible doesn't,</v>

23
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:38.311
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

24
00:00:38.311 --> 00:00:39.630
<v Speaker 1>all these things that people quite at the Bible,</v>

25
00:00:39.631 --> 00:00:41.490
<v Speaker 1>the Bible is talking about donkeys and they were like,</v>

26
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:42.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

27
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.990
<v Speaker 1>so the data and they believe that America is a white country founded by white</v>

28
00:00:45.991 --> 00:00:47.210
<v Speaker 1>people and that,</v>

29
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.780
<v Speaker 1>that the,</v>

30
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.500
<v Speaker 1>that the people who like the black people in the Mexican people and eventually</v>

31
00:00:52.501 --> 00:00:54.540
<v Speaker 1>the Catholics and the Jews only they can say a cooler with Catholics.</v>

32
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.310
<v Speaker 1>Now these days the Catholics should get to leave,</v>

33
00:00:56.311 --> 00:00:57.144
<v Speaker 1>go back home.</v>

34
00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:58.960
<v Speaker 1>And because America is a,</v>

35
00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:59.560
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

36
00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.810
<v Speaker 1>and the whole America is for white people is the whole white is just a different</v>

37
00:01:03.811 --> 00:01:06.540
<v Speaker 1>way of saying the white ethno state thing that a lot of the people or the alt</v>

38
00:01:06.541 --> 00:01:07.374
<v Speaker 1>right and the national,</v>

39
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.280
<v Speaker 1>the white nationalist movement say then,</v>

40
00:01:09.281 --> 00:01:10.770
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>

41
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:11.633
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

42
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.770
<v Speaker 1>they think that this is,</v>

43
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.000
<v Speaker 1>that they,</v>

44
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.360
<v Speaker 1>they think America's,</v>

45
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.280
<v Speaker 1>they think this,</v>

46
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.340
<v Speaker 1>the whole idea of America is that it's for whites only and that the rest of us</v>

47
00:01:20.341 --> 00:01:21.174
<v Speaker 1>need to go home.</v>

48
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.410
<v Speaker 1>I feel for you.</v>

49
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:28.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'd be standing there with these people in the woods in Kentucky looking</v>

50
00:01:28.051 --> 00:01:29.490
<v Speaker 1>into the eyes of madness,</v>

51
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.200
<v Speaker 1>whether we're in satin sheets over their head with holes poked out for eyes.</v>

52
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.870
<v Speaker 1>Well it's sort of,</v>

53
00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.180
<v Speaker 1>there was a lot of it that was fun.</v>

54
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was like we got there,</v>

55
00:01:37.471 --> 00:01:39.060
<v Speaker 1>I got out of the car and there's a line in the,</v>

56
00:01:39.061 --> 00:01:41.460
<v Speaker 1>in the show where you can hear me before you see that I'm going like,</v>

57
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.260
<v Speaker 1>oh this wasn't a good idea.</v>

58
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.380
<v Speaker 1>And that was really me saying this was not a good idea.</v>

59
00:01:46.381 --> 00:01:49.740
<v Speaker 1>That was not me making a joke cause I see a phalanx of them and they're all</v>

60
00:01:49.741 --> 00:01:50.700
<v Speaker 1>standing there at attention.</v>

61
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:51.810
<v Speaker 1>And right when we got there,</v>

62
00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:55.020
<v Speaker 1>the guy who was an all blue was like immediately goes into a rant about</v>

63
00:01:55.021 --> 00:01:55.471
<v Speaker 1>Ferguson.</v>

64
00:01:55.471 --> 00:01:58.640
<v Speaker 1>It was in 2014 so it was all about Ferguson and how black people aren't policed</v>

65
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.610
<v Speaker 1>themselves and do the white man is going to Dah,</v>

66
00:02:00.611 --> 00:02:00.801
<v Speaker 1>Dah,</v>

67
00:02:00.801 --> 00:02:00.961
<v Speaker 1>Dah,</v>

68
00:02:00.961 --> 00:02:01.200
<v Speaker 1>Dah.</v>

69
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.290
<v Speaker 1>While at the same time they don't advocate violence cause it's clear that at</v>

70
00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:08.040
<v Speaker 1>some point they were told if you talk about violence the FBI will be here every</v>

71
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.040
<v Speaker 1>weekend.</v>

72
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.610
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

73
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.061
<v Speaker 1>so they're like,</v>

74
00:02:09.061 --> 00:02:09.871
<v Speaker 1>we don't advocate violence.</v>

75
00:02:09.871 --> 00:02:10.760
<v Speaker 1>We advocate self defense.</v>

76
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:11.610
<v Speaker 1>We don't hate black people,</v>

77
00:02:11.611 --> 00:02:15.240
<v Speaker 1>we just love our people but also black people can't look what they're doing in</v>

78
00:02:15.241 --> 00:02:18.510
<v Speaker 1>Ferguson that shows that black people aren't whatever blah blah blah are the</v>

79
00:02:18.511 --> 00:02:19.590
<v Speaker 1>equivalent of the white man.</v>

80
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:20.693
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

81
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:21.870
<v Speaker 1>and so I had to,</v>

82
00:02:21.871 --> 00:02:23.160
<v Speaker 1>so when we first started shooting,</v>

83
00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.380
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

84
00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.950
<v Speaker 1>there was this like this guy was just gone off and I just heard it was like</v>

85
00:02:25.951 --> 00:02:28.770
<v Speaker 1>having to take it and wondering is this going to be the next three hours?</v>

86
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.240
<v Speaker 1>It's this kind of just like yelling.</v>

87
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:31.800
<v Speaker 1>And the producer stepped in and said,</v>

88
00:02:31.801 --> 00:02:32.634
<v Speaker 1>all right everybody,</v>

89
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:33.450
<v Speaker 1>let's just,</v>

90
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.040
<v Speaker 1>oh we got to check the camera for a second.</v>

91
00:02:35.041 --> 00:02:37.680
<v Speaker 1>And we slowed it down and then we set up chairs when we sat down and started</v>

92
00:02:37.681 --> 00:02:39.360
<v Speaker 1>talking and it from that point forward,</v>

93
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.280
<v Speaker 1>they were so excited to talk about their clan thing cause they don't get asked</v>

94
00:02:44.281 --> 00:02:45.090
<v Speaker 1>that a lot.</v>

95
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.150
<v Speaker 1>That they sort of like eventually you would if you weren't thinking that it was</v>

96
00:02:48.151 --> 00:02:48.721
<v Speaker 1>the Klan,</v>

97
00:02:48.721 --> 00:02:49.081
<v Speaker 1>you'd be like,</v>

98
00:02:49.081 --> 00:02:49.201
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

99
00:02:49.201 --> 00:02:50.520
<v Speaker 1>it's just people talking about their lives.</v>

100
00:02:50.521 --> 00:02:51.271
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree with them,</v>

101
00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:51.580
<v Speaker 1>but they're,</v>

102
00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:52.110
<v Speaker 1>they're not,</v>

103
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.100
<v Speaker 1>they didn't stay angry.</v>

104
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.950
<v Speaker 2>I was talking to this photographer,</v>

105
00:02:55.951 --> 00:02:59.820
<v Speaker 2>I was at this festival this weekend and she had a,</v>

106
00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

107
00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.810
<v Speaker 2>a film camera you don't like,</v>

108
00:03:01.811 --> 00:03:02.910
<v Speaker 2>do you develop your own Phipps?</v>

109
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:03.130
<v Speaker 2>She's,</v>

110
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.581
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>

111
00:03:03.581 --> 00:03:06.880
<v Speaker 2>you can always develop black and white because if you develop,</v>

112
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:07.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

113
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.920
<v Speaker 2>color pictures,</v>

114
00:03:08.921 --> 00:03:09.754
<v Speaker 2>the fumes,</v>

115
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:11.920
<v Speaker 2>well they'll knock you right out.</v>

116
00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:13.301
<v Speaker 2>And so I said,</v>

117
00:03:13.301 --> 00:03:16.180
<v Speaker 2>so just a little bit of that would be a great time.</v>

118
00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:18.163
<v Speaker 2>It's a small,</v>

119
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.870
<v Speaker 2>so just get a little bit of that and you can just huffing paint.</v>

120
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:23.141
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

121
00:03:23.141 --> 00:03:24.640

<v Speaker 2>Have you ever tried poppers?</v>

125
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.010
<v Speaker 2>Poppers are,</v>

126
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.160
<v Speaker 2>those are the things that they crack them and they sniff it.</v>

131
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.010
<v Speaker 2>I worked at Newport creamery.</v>

145
00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.250
<v Speaker 2>That killed a lot of brands.</v>

146
00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:06.400
<v Speaker 2>That kills a lot of brands.</v>

147
00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.970
<v Speaker 2>I remember I did one weekend in college and then I think I did it on a Friday</v>

148
00:04:09.971 --> 00:04:14.590
<v Speaker 2>night and on the Sunday I was just walking around yelling all weird.</v>

149
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.450
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I was forced into Yale just because I was trying to justify it</v>

150
00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:20.650
<v Speaker 2>how I felt or if it was a natural yell,</v>

151
00:04:20.651 --> 00:04:22.390
<v Speaker 2>but yelling was happening.</v>

152
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.230
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

153
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

154
00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:24.460
<v Speaker 2>And you couldn't help it.</v>

155
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:25.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

156
00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.970
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

157
00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.330
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you ever just tweak out by yourself just to,</v>

158
00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:30.280
<v Speaker 2>you haven't you?</v>

159
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.850
<v Speaker 2>Never just,</v>

160
00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.070
<v Speaker 2>you absolutely do.</v>

161
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.180
<v Speaker 2>After like a crazy workout.</v>

162
00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.390
<v Speaker 2>Hi ma'am.</v>

163
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.731
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

164
00:04:36.731 --> 00:04:37.270
<v Speaker 2>I have to work.</v>

165
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm usually spent week out just of Connor at the way in was just tweaking out,</v>

166
00:04:45.161 --> 00:04:46.870
<v Speaker 2>but it was for show which was shelf.</v>

167
00:04:46.871 --> 00:04:48.370
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you put a show for yourself,</v>

168
00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:52.420
<v Speaker 2>change your state of mind just by yourself.</v>

169
00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.751
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

170
00:04:52.751 --> 00:04:53.231
<v Speaker 2>Like people say,</v>

171
00:04:53.231 --> 00:04:54.040
<v Speaker 2>if you smile,</v>

172
00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.060
<v Speaker 2>change your mind.</v>

173
00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.510
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

174
00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.760
<v Speaker 2>It will change the way your brain actually feels.</v>

175
00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.181
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

176
00:04:58.181 --> 00:04:59.140
<v Speaker 2>if you freak out,</v>

177
00:04:59.141 --> 00:04:59.980
<v Speaker 2>it probably does that too,</v>

178
00:04:59.981 --> 00:05:00.660
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

179
00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:01.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

180
00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

181
00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:02.350
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>

182
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:03.160
<v Speaker 2>There's ways to do it.</v>

183
00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

184
00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:04.570
<v Speaker 2>why Wildwood Indians,</v>

185
00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:05.501
<v Speaker 2>native Americans,</v>

186
00:05:05.501 --> 00:05:06.280
<v Speaker 2>when they would do those,</v>

187
00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.480
<v Speaker 2>those battle cries.</v>

188
00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:08.560
<v Speaker 2>Why else are they doing that?</v>

189
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:09.783
<v Speaker 2>But getting fired up.</v>

190
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

191
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.400
<v Speaker 2>You get hyped up by yelling or singing a song.</v>

192
00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:13.480
<v Speaker 2>Viking.</v>

193
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

194
00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:15.550
<v Speaker 2>Is that New Zealand,</v>

195
00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.791
<v Speaker 2>New Zealand,</v>

196
00:05:18.791 --> 00:05:19.540
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

197
00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

198
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.040
<v Speaker 2>Well they uh,</v>

199
00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:22.581
<v Speaker 2>they would play,</v>

200
00:05:22.581 --> 00:05:25.900
<v Speaker 2>it's this video of them plan the USA team.</v>

201
00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:26.950
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

202
00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:30.830
<v Speaker 2>And they're doing this elaborate thing they're doing.</v>

203
00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:32.410
<v Speaker 2>It's very elaborate.</v>

204
00:05:32.411 --> 00:05:36.580
<v Speaker 2>And when just energetic and they cut to the USA team.</v>

205
00:05:36.581 --> 00:05:37.930
<v Speaker 2>And that kind of looking back,</v>

206
00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:39.670
<v Speaker 2>Kinda just con,</v>

207
00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:40.511
<v Speaker 2>not confused,</v>

208
00:05:40.511 --> 00:05:42.040
<v Speaker 2>but just what's going on.</v>

209
00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:43.540
<v Speaker 2>And they went through this whole thing.</v>

210
00:05:43.541 --> 00:05:44.200
<v Speaker 2>Is this right here?</v>

211
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

212
00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:45.301
<v Speaker 2>it did.</v>

213
00:05:45.301 --> 00:05:46.330
<v Speaker 2>In a basketball game.</v>

214
00:05:46.331 --> 00:05:47.860
<v Speaker 2>He had a basketball volume.</v>

215
00:05:47.861 --> 00:05:48.694
<v Speaker 2>This is ridiculous.</v>

216
00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:49.743
<v Speaker 3>Basketball</v>

217
00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:52.773
<v Speaker 3>and</v>

218
00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:55.920
<v Speaker 3>dusted by 45 points.</v>

219
00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:57.133
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

220
00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.800
<v Speaker 3>You playing NBA superstars,</v>

221
00:06:00.801 --> 00:06:01.970
<v Speaker 3>you fuck the dummies?</v>

222
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.631
<v Speaker 3>What is this?</v>

223
00:06:02.631 --> 00:06:05.690
<v Speaker 3>What a cult is for the it means that's what they do all the time.</v>

224
00:06:05.691 --> 00:06:07.970
<v Speaker 3>But it's just,</v>

225
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:10.460
<v Speaker 3>it seems so stupid.</v>

226
00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:11.780
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

227
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:15.700
<v Speaker 3>it seems stupid if you have you played basketball,</v>

228
00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:16.713
<v Speaker 3>this is stupid.</v>

229
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:21.880
<v Speaker 4>Something can have evolved as a virtue in some circumstances and still be of the</v>

230
00:06:22.791 --> 00:06:26.450
<v Speaker 4>type that if magnified beyond its proper limits becomes pathological.</v>

231
00:06:26.451 --> 00:06:28.970
<v Speaker 4>So let me tell you something I learned about Hitler,</v>

232
00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:32.660
<v Speaker 4>which really I haven't recovered from my shock from this.</v>

233
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.080
<v Speaker 4>So we'd been looking at the relationship between political belief and</v>

234
00:06:36.081 --> 00:06:36.914
<v Speaker 4>personality.</v>

235
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:37.641
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>

236
00:06:37.641 --> 00:06:40.490
<v Speaker 4>And your political belief is strongly determined by your temperament.</v>

237
00:06:40.491 --> 00:06:43.670
<v Speaker 4>So liberal left types are high in trait openness.</v>

238
00:06:43.671 --> 00:06:45.650
<v Speaker 4>That's creativity and low in conscientiousness.</v>

239
00:06:45.651 --> 00:06:49.550
<v Speaker 4>But you can fragment conscientiousness up into industriousness and orderliness.</v>

240
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.580
<v Speaker 4>And the real predictor for conservatism is an orderliness,</v>

241
00:06:52.581 --> 00:06:53.720
<v Speaker 4>not industriousness.</v>

242
00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:54.681
<v Speaker 4>And you might think,</v>

243
00:06:54.681 --> 00:06:55.670
<v Speaker 4>well that's no surprise,</v>

244
00:06:55.671 --> 00:06:57.020
<v Speaker 4>right wingers are more orderly,</v>

245
00:06:57.021 --> 00:06:58.730
<v Speaker 4>hence Hitler's call for order,</v>

246
00:06:58.731 --> 00:06:59.211
<v Speaker 4>let's say.</v>

247
00:06:59.211 --> 00:07:02.840
<v Speaker 4>But it's one thing to s two to posit that.</v>

248
00:07:02.841 --> 00:07:04.130
<v Speaker 4>And another thing to measure it,</v>

249
00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:09.050
<v Speaker 4>now it's measurable and it appears that orderliness is associated with</v>

250
00:07:09.051 --> 00:07:10.520
<v Speaker 4>sensitivity to discussed.</v>

251
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.950
<v Speaker 4>And this is actually a really big deal.</v>

252
00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:13.970
<v Speaker 4>It's a really big deal.</v>

253
00:07:13.971 --> 00:07:17.630
<v Speaker 4>So there's a paper that was published in plause one about three years ago</v>

254
00:07:17.631 --> 00:07:21.800
<v Speaker 4>looking at the relationship between the prevalence of infectious diseases and</v>

255
00:07:21.801 --> 00:07:23.360
<v Speaker 4>authoritarian political attitudes.</v>

256
00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:27.200
<v Speaker 4>And they did it country by country and then within countries by state or</v>

257
00:07:27.201 --> 00:07:28.034
<v Speaker 4>province.</v>

258
00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:31.820
<v Speaker 4>And the correlation between the prevalence of infectious diseases and</v>

259
00:07:31.821 --> 00:07:35.600
<v Speaker 4>authoritarian slash right wing political beliefs at the local individual level</v>

260
00:07:35.601 --> 00:07:36.620
<v Speaker 4>was 0.6.</v>

261
00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:39.650
<v Speaker 4>And so I want to take this apart a little bit.</v>

262
00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:40.281
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

263
00:07:40.281 --> 00:07:45.200
<v Speaker 4>So the idea is that this is part of what you might describe as the extended</v>

264
00:07:45.201 --> 00:07:46.520
<v Speaker 4>behavioral immune system.</v>

265
00:07:46.521 --> 00:07:50.540
<v Speaker 4>And one of the problems with the interactions between groups of human beings in</v>

266
00:07:50.541 --> 00:07:51.890
<v Speaker 4>our evolutionary past was,</v>

267
00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:52.471
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

268
00:07:52.471 --> 00:07:54.580
<v Speaker 4>exactly what happened to the native Americans is,</v>

269
00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:54.861
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

270
00:07:54.861 --> 00:07:57.500
<v Speaker 4>they came out and shook hands with the Spanish can keystone doors,</v>

271
00:07:57.501 --> 00:07:59.420
<v Speaker 4>and then within a couple of generations,</v>

272
00:07:59.421 --> 00:08:02.690
<v Speaker 4>90% of them were dead of smallpox and measles and mumps.</v>

273
00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:07.690
<v Speaker 4>And so it's been a truism in our evolutionary past that if you meet a group of</v>

274
00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:09.260
<v Speaker 4>isolated,</v>

275
00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.020
<v Speaker 4>if you're a group of isolated humans and you meet another group of isolated</v>

276
00:08:12.021 --> 00:08:13.670
<v Speaker 4>humans and you trade pathogens,</v>

277
00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:17.300
<v Speaker 4>there's a real possibility that you and everyone you know are going to be dead</v>

278
00:08:17.301 --> 00:08:18.320
<v Speaker 4>in no time flat.</v>

279
00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:23.920
<v Speaker 4>And so we have a disgust mechanism that that produces this implicit,</v>

280
00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:26.750
<v Speaker 4>let's call it racial,</v>

281
00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:28.130
<v Speaker 4>racial and ethnic bias.</v>

282
00:08:28.131 --> 00:08:30.710
<v Speaker 4>That is part and parcel of the human cognitive landscape.</v>

283
00:08:30.711 --> 00:08:33.710
<v Speaker 4>But the problem with that is that it's rooted in a disgust mechanism that</v>

284
00:08:33.711 --> 00:08:35.420
<v Speaker 4>actually serves as a protective function.</v>

285
00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:36.260
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

286
00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:37.460
<v Speaker 4>when I was sorting this out,</v>

287
00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:41.330
<v Speaker 4>I was reading Hitler's table talk and Hitler's table talk is a very interesting</v>

288
00:08:41.331 --> 00:08:41.631
<v Speaker 4>book.</v>

289
00:08:41.631 --> 00:08:42.470
<v Speaker 4>It's a book,</v>

290
00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:47.670
<v Speaker 4>a book of his spontaneous mealtime utterances from 1939 to 1942 and I went</v>

291
00:08:48.831 --> 00:08:52.790
<v Speaker 4>through with this new knowledge because people think of conservatives as if like</v>

292
00:08:52.791 --> 00:08:55.010
<v Speaker 4>or fascist as afraid of those who are different.</v>

293
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:55.973
<v Speaker 4>They're not afraid,</v>

294
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.000
<v Speaker 4>they're disgusted.</v>

295
00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:00.600
<v Speaker 4>And that's not the same thing because you burn things you're disgusted by.</v>

296
00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:04.080
<v Speaker 4>And so it was terrifying to me to read it because then I also thought,</v>

297
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:05.580
<v Speaker 4>oh well disgust,</v>

298
00:09:05.581 --> 00:09:09.630
<v Speaker 4>sensitivity is associated with orderliness and you need to order in a society in</v>

299
00:09:09.631 --> 00:09:10.560
<v Speaker 4>order to maintain it.</v>

300
00:09:10.561 --> 00:09:13.920
<v Speaker 4>And the Germans are very orderly and that was actually a canonical part of their</v>

301
00:09:13.921 --> 00:09:14.701
<v Speaker 4>civilization.</v>

302
00:09:14.701 --> 00:09:17.370
<v Speaker 4>And part of actually what makes them great and powerful.</v>

303
00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:22.080
<v Speaker 4>And that just had to tilt a little farther than necessary and all of a sudden</v>

304
00:09:22.081 --> 00:09:23.790
<v Speaker 4>everything needed to be get cleaned.</v>

305
00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:24.601
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

306
00:09:24.601 --> 00:09:27.360
<v Speaker 4>Hitler talked about cleanliness all the time and he actually meant that.</v>

307
00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:29.460
<v Speaker 4>And so this thing that's emerging,</v>

308
00:09:29.461 --> 00:09:29.671
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

309
00:09:29.671 --> 00:09:31.410
<v Speaker 4>you talked about its biological basis,</v>

310
00:09:31.411 --> 00:09:32.730
<v Speaker 4>it's evolutionary basis.</v>

311
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:33.391
<v Speaker 4>It is,</v>

312
00:09:33.391 --> 00:09:37.770
<v Speaker 4>it's part of this deeply rooted disgust system that protects us from dangerous</v>

313
00:09:37.771 --> 00:09:39.780
<v Speaker 4>pathogens that can manifest itself in.</v>

314
00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:42.090
<v Speaker 4>And does manifest itself in the political realm.</v>

315
00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:43.380
<v Speaker 4>It's not good.</v>

316
00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:44.070
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>
