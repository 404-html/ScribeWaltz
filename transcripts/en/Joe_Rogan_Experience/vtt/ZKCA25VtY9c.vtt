<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to get his nickname change from hybrid to big Brown.</v>

10
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:12.780
<v Speaker 1>This guy starts with big,</v>

11

<v Speaker 1>He's just big and Brown.</v>

15
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.700
<v Speaker 1>That's why everybody calls him big brown bats.</v>

16
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.740

00:00:43.861 --> 00:00:44.850
<v Speaker 1>He pulls it from my dad.</v>

<v Speaker 1>oh no.</v>

37
00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:49.770

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:50.653
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>

39
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.250

40
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.820
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

42
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.200
<v Speaker 1>See the problem with that is Nick Diaz can actually fight like that.</v>

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.120
<v Speaker 1>Oh my dad be his breaks off this dude.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

45
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.990
<v Speaker 1>It was about to throw him off the side of the highway and a leather jacket.</v>

46
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:04.711
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

47
00:01:04.711 --> 00:01:07.260
<v Speaker 1>I did not fuck around when a guy stands out like that,</v>

48
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.990
<v Speaker 1>so that's doing the old school boxing and one of two things can happen.</v>

49
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.500
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to scare you off or he's so good with his hands.</v>

50
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:14.770
<v Speaker 1>He's just kind of roll out.</v>

51
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:15.031
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

52
00:01:15.031 --> 00:01:15.661
<v Speaker 1>what's up dude?</v>

00:01:15.661 --> 00:01:16.494
<v Speaker 1>You want some?</v>

54
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.921
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

55
00:01:16.921 --> 00:01:17.610
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

56
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.443
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

57
00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:20.613
<v Speaker 1>he was weird.</v>

58
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:22.763
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you what,</v>

59
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:23.880
<v Speaker 1>for real man,</v>

60
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:25.590
<v Speaker 1>I remember my dad got in the car.</v>

61
00:01:25.591 --> 00:01:25.891
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

62
00:01:25.891 --> 00:01:27.000
<v Speaker 1>God dammit.</v>

63
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.260
<v Speaker 1>And then my brother gets out,</v>

64
00:01:28.261 --> 00:01:29.940
<v Speaker 1>kicks guy in the balls from behind,</v>

65
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.650
<v Speaker 1>but others probably 12 at the time he's this Christ brother kicked a grown man</v>

66
00:01:34.651 --> 00:01:36.000
<v Speaker 1>and the role of men in the balls,</v>

67
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.950
<v Speaker 1>but that's when it gets really dangerous because that kid gets involved.</v>

68
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.070
<v Speaker 1>Father becomes like super violent.</v>

69
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.830
<v Speaker 1>Little Brown was doing what was crying in the backseat.</v>

70
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.173
<v Speaker 1>How old were you?</v>

71
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.670
<v Speaker 1>Probably like 10 or 11 crying in the backseat seat.</v>

72
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.300
<v Speaker 1>Can't be trusted if shit goes down because you gotta remember my daycare was</v>

73
00:01:54.301 --> 00:01:55.380
<v Speaker 1>Shane Carbon on top of me.</v>

74
00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.120
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't getting a lot of take downs.</v>

75
00:01:57.121 --> 00:01:59.040
<v Speaker 1>I was on my back all the time.</v>

76
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.440
<v Speaker 1>That's a crazy way to start your training in MMA.</v>

77
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.363
<v Speaker 1>It was horrible,</v>

78
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:03.620
<v Speaker 1>horrible mess.</v>

79
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:04.453
<v Speaker 1>So crazy.</v>

80
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:05.071
<v Speaker 1>Every day.</v>

81
00:02:05.071 --> 00:02:06.060
<v Speaker 1>Just beat me up.</v>

82
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.100
<v Speaker 1>Trevor Whitman seems like a crazy dude,</v>

83
00:02:08.101 --> 00:02:08.340
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

84
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.111
<v Speaker 1>He's a good dude.</v>

85
00:02:09.111 --> 00:02:10.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was like a very good dude.</v>

86
00:02:10.441 --> 00:02:10.861
<v Speaker 1>Good guy.</v>

87
00:02:10.861 --> 00:02:11.870
<v Speaker 1>I haven't been there in years.</v>

88
00:02:11.871 --> 00:02:14.790
<v Speaker 1>The maniac like he had Shane Carwyn.</v>

89
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:15.330
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

90
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.240
<v Speaker 1>like why they wanted to have Shane Carwyn sport spar with GSP.</v>

91
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.621
<v Speaker 1>GSP was like,</v>

92
00:02:19.621 --> 00:02:20.280
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

93
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

94
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:21.450
<v Speaker 1>why would I,</v>

95
00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.283
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

96
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.370
<v Speaker 1>Why would I spar him?</v>

97
00:02:23.371 --> 00:02:24.570
<v Speaker 1>Like what are you talking about?</v>

98
00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.170
<v Speaker 1>And I think Trevor's a genius becomes a strike and stuff like that.</v>

99
00:02:28.171 --> 00:02:32.670
<v Speaker 1>But I think back on it and there's this thing where I felt like I had to prove</v>

100
00:02:32.671 --> 00:02:36.300
<v Speaker 1>to everyone I could hang with Shane car and no matter when we were sparring,</v>

101
00:02:36.301 --> 00:02:37.590
<v Speaker 1>that's how my footwork got so good.</v>

102
00:02:37.591 --> 00:02:37.920
<v Speaker 1>Cause I'm,</v>

103
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm used to this giant water buffalo mad water buffalo chasing me around the</v>

104
00:02:42.601 --> 00:02:43.231
<v Speaker 1>octagon.</v>

105
00:02:43.231 --> 00:02:45.750
<v Speaker 1>So I was trying to get out of the way cause he landed right hand.</v>

106
00:02:45.751 --> 00:02:46.590
<v Speaker 1>It was a short him,</v>

107
00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.310
<v Speaker 1>he was not a good man is trouble.</v>

108
00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.991
<v Speaker 1>He hit so hard,</v>

109
00:02:48.991 --> 00:02:49.771
<v Speaker 1>he's got so,</v>

110
00:02:49.771 --> 00:02:51.180
<v Speaker 1>so I got used to that right.</v>

111
00:02:51.181 --> 00:02:54.050
<v Speaker 1>And I'm moving nonstop and then when the bell goes,</v>

112
00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.361
<v Speaker 1>Ding,</v>

113
00:02:54.361 --> 00:02:55.740
<v Speaker 1>Ding with 30 seconds left,</v>

114
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.611
<v Speaker 1>literally,</v>

115
00:02:56.611 --> 00:02:57.710
<v Speaker 1>no matter what we're doing,</v>

116
00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean Shane would stop,</v>

117
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.790
<v Speaker 1>walk to the middle of the cage and just rock 'em sock 'em robots.</v>

118
00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.630
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

119
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:05.890
<v Speaker 1>I did that for three years.</v>

120
00:03:05.891 --> 00:03:08.470
<v Speaker 1>And then finally a part of me was like,</v>

121
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:09.453
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

122
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.540
<v Speaker 1>how about no?</v>

123
00:03:10.541 --> 00:03:12.760
<v Speaker 1>And I shot a double back on him and we've never done that again.</v>

124
00:03:12.761 --> 00:03:13.594
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

125
00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:14.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm tired.</v>

126
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:15.970
<v Speaker 1>But I think back on my training,</v>

127
00:03:15.971 --> 00:03:16.211
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

128
00:03:16.211 --> 00:03:16.421
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

129
00:03:16.421 --> 00:03:17.254
<v Speaker 1>that was stupid.</v>

130
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:18.610
<v Speaker 1>Even taking them down.</v>

131
00:03:18.611 --> 00:03:18.761
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

132
00:03:18.761 --> 00:03:21.320
<v Speaker 1>he's so strong and he's a big Guy Guy.</v>

133
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.170
<v Speaker 1>Ever did a big fucking guy,</v>

134
00:03:23.171 --> 00:03:23.560

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.210
<v Speaker 1>Strong.</v>

136
00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.700
<v Speaker 1>A lot stronger than you and your strong Shane is 100% stronger than me.</v>

137
00:03:27.701 --> 00:03:28.420
<v Speaker 1>Not even close.</v>

138
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.620
<v Speaker 1>He's ridiculously strong.</v>

139
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.840
<v Speaker 1>Bone structure is just,</v>

140
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:32.830
<v Speaker 1>he's bigger than car.</v>

141
00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:33.870
<v Speaker 1>He's bigger than Lesner.</v>

142
00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.110
<v Speaker 1>He's legs are thick,</v>

143
00:03:35.111 --> 00:03:35.944

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.000
<v Speaker 1>huge shoulders.</v>

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.200
<v Speaker 1>He's hands man.</v>

146
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:39.680
<v Speaker 1>Before they did,</v>

147
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.270
<v Speaker 1>they redid the UFC gloves to fit over his hands.</v>

148
00:03:42.271 --> 00:03:43.360
<v Speaker 1>Shane's the reason Shane's,</v>

149
00:03:43.361 --> 00:03:44.950
<v Speaker 1>the reason why they changed the glove,</v>

150
00:03:44.951 --> 00:03:46.410
<v Speaker 1>Shane had a five XL gloves.</v>

151
00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.630
<v Speaker 1>You have to cut the glove just to get over to his hands are so ridiculous.</v>

152
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.751
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

153
00:03:49.751 --> 00:03:50.351
<v Speaker 1>When you shake them,</v>

154
00:03:50.351 --> 00:03:51.580
<v Speaker 1>it's like holding onto a ham.</v>

155
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.050
<v Speaker 1>What was frustrating to me is,</v>

156
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

157
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:54.940
<v Speaker 1>I've always been in love with Jujitsu.</v>

158
00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:55.690
<v Speaker 1>I would spend,</v>

159
00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.930
<v Speaker 1>Shane would get injured or you'd have to work at a regular job and I was just</v>

160
00:03:58.931 --> 00:04:02.140
<v Speaker 1>train full time and I would think I was being so good at Jujitsu.</v>

161
00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.450
<v Speaker 1>Then Shane would come in off a nine to five,</v>

162
00:04:04.451 --> 00:04:04.691
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

163
00:04:04.691 --> 00:04:06.970
<v Speaker 1>shift Walkin by Jujitsu Hunt,</v>

164
00:04:06.971 --> 00:04:07.451
<v Speaker 1>let's do it.</v>

165
00:04:07.451 --> 00:04:07.751
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

166
00:04:07.751 --> 00:04:09.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to roll this big dude.</v>

167
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.810
<v Speaker 1>You just shut,</v>

168
00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:11.650
<v Speaker 1>shut it all down.</v>

169
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.790
<v Speaker 1>When I was training at a malls,</v>

170
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:13.980
<v Speaker 1>he came by and uh,</v>

171
00:04:13.981 --> 00:04:14.161
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

172
00:04:14.161 --> 00:04:15.730
<v Speaker 1>and trained one day and uh,</v>

173
00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:16.750
<v Speaker 1>I didn't get to roll with them,</v>

174
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:17.260
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

175
00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.600
<v Speaker 1>I watched people row with them and it was,</v>

176
00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.770
<v Speaker 1>it was like a child playing with his daddy.</v>

177
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.410
<v Speaker 1>Daddy was just like rolling over.</v>

178
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.000
<v Speaker 1>I go with big guys.</v>

179
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.070
<v Speaker 1>I go the big guys all the time,</v>

180
00:04:30.071 --> 00:04:31.330
<v Speaker 1>but none like Shane,</v>

181
00:04:31.331 --> 00:04:31.540
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

182
00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.880
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't even look real when he walked in the door.</v>

183
00:04:33.881 --> 00:04:34.690
<v Speaker 1>If I didn't know,</v>

184
00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:35.060
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

185
00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.893
<v Speaker 1>what's up Shane?</v>

186
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.850
<v Speaker 1>But if I didn't know what I would be like saying a peep this motherfucker,</v>

187
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.190

188
00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.300
<v Speaker 1>This is how it happened.</v>

241
00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.990
<v Speaker 1>I think one or two fights at the time had zero.</v>

242
00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:57.350
<v Speaker 1>The Machita fight,</v>

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:58.213
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

244
00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.300
<v Speaker 1>it was close wide.</v>

245
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:00.080
<v Speaker 1>That was a close fight.</v>

246
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.913
<v Speaker 1>I just thought,</v>

247
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:02.720
<v Speaker 1>what do you think it was about?</v>

248
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:04.210

<v Speaker 1>it's so crazy.</v>

256
00:06:11.331 --> 00:06:12.380
<v Speaker 1>Almost stopped him in the first round.</v>

257
00:06:12.381 --> 00:06:14.060
<v Speaker 1>He broke his John Half and the first round like,</v>

258
00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.990
<v Speaker 1>or I'll ask you fought the last two rounds with a John that was shifting up and</v>

259
00:06:17.991 --> 00:06:19.370
<v Speaker 1>down cause it was shattered in the side.</v>

260
00:06:19.371 --> 00:06:20.630
<v Speaker 1>Somebody who's fighting our last game,</v>

261
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:22.400
<v Speaker 1>he's got some good stories.</v>

262
00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:26.420
<v Speaker 1>When we talk about how guys are hyping fights,</v>

263
00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:27.910
<v Speaker 1>it can backfire on you.</v>

264
00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:29.630
<v Speaker 1>Like Yo with the metro and fight.</v>

265
00:06:29.631 --> 00:06:30.464

268
00:06:33.621 --> 00:06:35.570

269
00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:35.960
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

270
00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:36.793
<v Speaker 1>It was great.</v>

271
00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:38.690
<v Speaker 1>When you fight legends like Mirko Cro,</v>

272
00:06:38.691 --> 00:06:39.050
<v Speaker 1>Cop,</v>

293
00:07:11.511 --> 00:07:13.390
<v Speaker 1>a training with our Lasky after,</v>

294
00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.900
<v Speaker 1>for after training where he's,</v>

295
00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:15.411
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

296
00:07:15.411 --> 00:07:16.130
<v Speaker 1>come here.</v>

297
00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:16.371
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

298
00:07:16.371 --> 00:07:16.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

299
00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:17.151
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

300
00:07:17.151 --> 00:07:17.984
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

301
00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:21.770
<v Speaker 1>Andrea Alaska and I used to train together Jackson's camp and when I was getting</v>

302
00:07:21.771 --> 00:07:24.470
<v Speaker 1>ready for a fight this over shoot almost four years ago,</v>

303
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:26.600
<v Speaker 1>the two fighters that I,</v>

304
00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:30.200
<v Speaker 1>when I first got into the game that I admired and loved where Mirko Cro,</v>

305
00:07:30.201 --> 00:07:33.710
<v Speaker 1>cop and Andre are Laski by two very favorites.</v>

306
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:34.760
<v Speaker 1>That's who I wanted to be like.</v>

307
00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:38.690
<v Speaker 1>So I walked in the gym and it was our last keys first day at Jackson's too.</v>

308
00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:39.980
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

309
00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:40.341
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

310
00:07:40.341 --> 00:07:42.440
<v Speaker 1>when you seen a guy on TV fighting all the time,</v>

311
00:07:42.441 --> 00:07:43.310
<v Speaker 1>then you run into and be like,</v>

312
00:07:43.311 --> 00:07:43.850
<v Speaker 1>damn,</v>

313
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:44.390
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

314
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:45.111
<v Speaker 1>So I see him like,</v>

315
00:07:45.111 --> 00:07:45.561
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>

316
00:07:45.561 --> 00:07:46.450
<v Speaker 1>this under Lasky.</v>

317
00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:48.890
<v Speaker 1>So then that guy [inaudible] our last year in the ring,</v>

318
00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:49.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

319
00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:50.151
<v Speaker 1>first day spine,</v>

320
00:07:50.151 --> 00:07:50.450
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

321
00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:51.400
<v Speaker 1>fresh off the plane.</v>

322
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:52.263
<v Speaker 1>When I'm sparring with him.</v>

323
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:54.380
<v Speaker 1>So me and him are gone and it's a,</v>

324
00:07:54.381 --> 00:07:55.520
<v Speaker 1>it's a close round.</v>

325
00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.560
<v Speaker 1>He's a bad ass right at me and we're going back and forth.</v>

326
00:07:57.561 --> 00:08:01.640
<v Speaker 1>People would literally stop and watch a spar were just these dog rounds back and</v>

327
00:08:01.641 --> 00:08:01.941
<v Speaker 1>forth,</v>

328
00:08:01.941 --> 00:08:02.930
<v Speaker 1>five rounds in a row.</v>

329
00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:06.980
<v Speaker 1>Then later that night we grapple and then,</v>

330
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:07.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

331
00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:09.560
<v Speaker 1>the next morning I drink coffee every morning,</v>

332
00:08:09.561 --> 00:08:09.890
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

333
00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:12.290
<v Speaker 1>Drinking coffee now this horrible coffee breath,</v>

334
00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:14.330
<v Speaker 1>breath smelled like pure coffees.</v>

335
00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:14.871
<v Speaker 1>Shit breath.</v>

336
00:08:14.871 --> 00:08:15.520
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

337
00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:19.640
<v Speaker 1>And I go up to Andre and he's not very warm person at all.</v>

338
00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:20.691
<v Speaker 1>Not at all.</v>

339
00:08:20.691 --> 00:08:23.600
<v Speaker 1>Is that very bell rush in where it's going to take a while to be his friend.</v>

340
00:08:23.601 --> 00:08:25.710
<v Speaker 1>I can tell and I'm trying to break these barriers.</v>

341
00:08:25.711 --> 00:08:26.210

00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:41.500
<v Speaker 1>How did you get into basically majoring in Dick's?</v>

590
00:13:41.501 --> 00:13:46.000
<v Speaker 1>Like what road did you go down and he said in Egypt there's someplace in Egypt</v>

591
00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:48.010
<v Speaker 1>where there's a religion.</v>

592
00:13:48.011 --> 00:13:48.880
<v Speaker 1>They might be Muslim,</v>

593
00:13:48.881 --> 00:13:49.301
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure.</v>

594
00:13:49.301 --> 00:13:50.260
<v Speaker 1>But they get erections.</v>

595
00:13:50.261 --> 00:13:51.094
<v Speaker 1>They think it's Dell,</v>

596
00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:52.150
<v Speaker 1>the Satan's work.</v>

597
00:13:52.151 --> 00:13:53.800
<v Speaker 1>And they break their dad's not in.</v>

598
00:13:53.801 --> 00:13:55.510
<v Speaker 1>That's not Muslim religion.</v>

599
00:13:55.511 --> 00:13:56.170
<v Speaker 1>That might be,</v>

600
00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:56.471
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>

601
00:13:56.471 --> 00:13:57.930
<v Speaker 1>it's an extremist Muslim.</v>

602
00:13:58.070 --> 00:14:02.380
<v Speaker 1>He was saying there are Muslim just sounds like a dumb person who this look the</v>

603
00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:03.790
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>

604
00:14:03.791 --> 00:14:07.180
<v Speaker 1>It's another crazy cause he was saying and these guys need help.</v>

605
00:14:07.181 --> 00:14:09.430
<v Speaker 1>So he got into it because he was exposed to it.</v>

606
00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:11.830
<v Speaker 1>So these guys think it's Satan's work.</v>

607
00:14:11.831 --> 00:14:12.461
<v Speaker 1>The Devil's work.</v>

608
00:14:12.461 --> 00:14:13.330
<v Speaker 1>They'd get erections,</v>

609
00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:14.440
<v Speaker 1>snap their day.</v>

610
00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:16.930
<v Speaker 1>A lot of them die from internal bleeding.</v>

611
00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:17.230
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

612
00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:18.550
<v Speaker 1>they brushed doctors down there.</v>

613
00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:21.190
<v Speaker 1>So most urologists go down to this part of the world.</v>

614
00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:22.083
<v Speaker 1>That's a fix it.</v>
