<v Speaker 1>that's kind of creepy.</v>

20
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.610
<v Speaker 1>It's like you have imagined having a friend and you know that the friend is</v>

21
00:00:28.611 --> 00:00:29.000
<v Speaker 1>safe,</v>

22
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.980
<v Speaker 1>but right outside the door you could see a guy wants to kill your friend and</v>

23
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.120
<v Speaker 1>he's just trying to figure out a way to get in.</v>

24
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.170
<v Speaker 1>That's what it was.</v>

25
00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.280
<v Speaker 1>He's going to get in and kill your friend with his face and his chickens are</v>

26
00:00:39.281 --> 00:00:40.101

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.760
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

34
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:44.571
<v Speaker 1>they bucking,</v>

35
00:00:44.571 --> 00:00:45.710
<v Speaker 1>they come near you when the,</v>

36
00:00:45.711 --> 00:00:45.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

37
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.410
<v Speaker 1>when you come out and this conti fucking dog,</v>

38
00:00:48.411 --> 00:00:49.640
<v Speaker 1>once they eat my friends,</v>

39
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:50.390
<v Speaker 1>I had a,</v>

40
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:51.171
<v Speaker 1>we had some chickens,</v>

41
00:00:51.171 --> 00:00:51.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

42
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:51.921
<v Speaker 1>we're deciding,</v>

43
00:00:51.921 --> 00:00:52.161
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

44
00:00:52.161 --> 00:00:54.590
<v Speaker 1>we're going to let them free cause they gotta they gotta get out and they got a</v>

45
00:00:54.591 --> 00:00:57.350
<v Speaker 1>pack and they got to get some bugs and they're just happier.</v>

46
00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.120
<v Speaker 1>So we let the chickens out.</v>

47
00:00:59.121 --> 00:00:59.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

48
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.100
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know their neighbor had a rooster.</v>

49
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.510
<v Speaker 1>The rooster comes over,</v>

50
00:01:02.511 --> 00:01:02.830
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

51
00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.250
<v Speaker 1>He just claims my chickens.</v>

52
00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:06.020
<v Speaker 1>And so you'd go out to feed the chickens.</v>

53
00:01:06.021 --> 00:01:07.220
<v Speaker 1>The rooster would come attack you.</v>

54
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

55
00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.170
<v Speaker 1>he would just get up there,</v>

56
00:01:09.171 --> 00:01:10.280
<v Speaker 1>spur your legs,</v>

57
00:01:10.281 --> 00:01:11.020
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

58
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

59
00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:12.021
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>

60
00:01:12.021 --> 00:01:14.930
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy rooster and we could not keep him away from the chickens.</v>

61
00:01:14.931 --> 00:01:15.051
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

62
00:01:15.051 --> 00:01:16.190
<v Speaker 1>he's raping my ladies.</v>

63
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:18.553
<v Speaker 1>I want,</v>

64
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.440
<v Speaker 1>my goal was the unfertilized chicken eggs in a lot of balloons.</v>

65
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.450
<v Speaker 1>So we're trying to think like,</v>

66
00:01:23.451 --> 00:01:25.310
<v Speaker 1>we can't kill this dude's rooster.</v>

67
00:01:25.311 --> 00:01:25.491
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

68
00:01:25.491 --> 00:01:26.540
<v Speaker 1>that's just not right.</v>

69
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.190
<v Speaker 1>So I got this concrete rooster and I put it out by the chicken coop.</v>

70
00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.280
<v Speaker 1>That rooster comes over and just starts fighting this concrete rooster.</v>

71
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.110
<v Speaker 1>He kicked his own ass and just left,</v>

72
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.283
<v Speaker 1>came back.</v>

73
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:39.800
<v Speaker 1>So if you have rooster problems,</v>

74
00:01:39.801 --> 00:01:40.030
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

75
00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.560
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

76
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.930
<v Speaker 1>just get a statue.</v>

77
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.860
<v Speaker 1>That's his own ass.</v>

78
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.620
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>

79
00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.480
<v Speaker 1>What a dumb fucking animal.</v>

80
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.060
<v Speaker 1>He was like scared to come down,</v>

81
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.650
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

82
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:52.483
<v Speaker 1>Stupid.</v>

83
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.751
<v Speaker 1>Everything's good.</v>

84
00:01:53.751 --> 00:01:54.130

91
00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:04.700

92
00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.340

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.290
<v Speaker 1>It was one of the key lift.</v>

96
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how Sophie lifted it.</v>

97
00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.070
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

98
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.100

117
00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.270
<v Speaker 2>I followed crystal Leah the other night at the,</v>

122
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.050
<v Speaker 2>I took a nap like at nine o'clock at night and the audience was standing.</v>

123
00:02:54.051 --> 00:02:54.884
<v Speaker 2>I got it now.</v>

124

128
00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.620

133
00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.360
<v Speaker 1>too lazy to stand up and shape.</v>

134
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:09.430

00:03:23.981 --> 00:03:26.330
<v Speaker 1>what of what you were saying about just I,</v>

150
00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:27.670
<v Speaker 1>I give a fuck totally,</v>

151
00:03:27.671 --> 00:03:28.570
<v Speaker 1>but I don't give a fuck.</v>

152
00:03:28.571 --> 00:03:30.310
<v Speaker 1>Like I could do it in a hammock at this point.</v>

153
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.320
<v Speaker 1>Just be,</v>

154
00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.870
<v Speaker 1>let's just my head out doing stand.</v>

155
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.300
<v Speaker 1>That's actually not a bad idea.</v>

156
00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.330
<v Speaker 1>That be pretty funny for 10 to be a good act.</v>

157
00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:38.950
<v Speaker 1>You were just laying there,</v>

158
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.720
<v Speaker 1>especially like if you,</v>

159
00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:42.520
<v Speaker 1>it was a part of like a comedy festival,</v>

160
00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.470
<v Speaker 1>not even a regular set.</v>

161
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:45.720
<v Speaker 1>Just like ladies and gentlemen,</v>

162
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.650
<v Speaker 1>we present you dom Irrera and a hammock and you just swinging back and forth</v>

163
00:03:50.651 --> 00:03:53.200
<v Speaker 1>with a wireless microphone in the air and talking shit.</v>

164
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.800
<v Speaker 1>When you look at the Warren Commission report and you look at the</v>

165
00:03:56.801 --> 00:03:57.880
<v Speaker 1>inconsistencies in it,</v>

166
00:03:57.881 --> 00:04:00.730
<v Speaker 1>there's a great book about it called the best evidence by David Liftin,</v>

167
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.661
<v Speaker 1>who was,</v>

168
00:04:01.661 --> 00:04:02.080
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

169
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.490
<v Speaker 1>he was actually an accountant and was hired to go over the Warren Commission</v>

170
00:04:06.491 --> 00:04:10.150
<v Speaker 1>report and found inconsistency after inconsistency over and over again.</v>

171
00:04:10.151 --> 00:04:11.770
<v Speaker 1>A detailed these in great order,</v>

172
00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.510
<v Speaker 1>but dif difference in the inconsistency of the autopsies and consistencies of</v>

173
00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.930
<v Speaker 1>the various reports of what went down in consistencies in the Warren Commission</v>

174
00:04:19.931 --> 00:04:22.150
<v Speaker 1>of their findings that would cancel out each other's findings.</v>

175
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.870
<v Speaker 1>He was in one of the few guys with the first guys to go through the entire 900</v>

176
00:04:25.871 --> 00:04:26.704
<v Speaker 1>volumes.</v>

177
00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:27.371
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating,</v>

178
00:04:27.371 --> 00:04:31.210
<v Speaker 1>fascinating book that I read when I was living in New Jersey.</v>

179
00:04:31.211 --> 00:04:31.411
<v Speaker 1>I was a,</v>

180
00:04:31.411 --> 00:04:33.010
<v Speaker 1>it was living in New York rather,</v>

181
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:38.160
<v Speaker 1>and I was doing a Gig on the road and I read it and fucking bombed that night.</v>

182
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.791
<v Speaker 1>All my God,</v>

183
00:04:39.791 --> 00:04:43.270
<v Speaker 1>it was in my hotel room all day reading is freaky conspiracy books shitting my</v>

184
00:04:43.271 --> 00:04:47.590
<v Speaker 1>pants and I was like 23 years old and then I went on stage that night and just,</v>

185
00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:48.430
<v Speaker 1>I hate it.</v>

186
00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:49.263
<v Speaker 1>It's terrible.</v>

187
00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.581
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

188
00:04:49.581 --> 00:04:51.880
<v Speaker 1>I learned a very valuable lesson from that book.</v>

189
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.590
<v Speaker 1>Don't read or watch depressing shit right before you go onstage or break into</v>

190
00:04:56.591 --> 00:04:59.180
<v Speaker 1>big conspiracy mongering in the middle of your set that you just know.</v>

191
00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.411
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

192
00:04:59.411 --> 00:05:01.480
<v Speaker 1>but I became a conspiracies break for sure.</v>

193
00:05:01.481 --> 00:05:02.230
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>

194
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.870
<v Speaker 1>That book best evidence was what threw me over the top.</v>

195
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.920
<v Speaker 1>I've had to really distinctive times where the things that I saw on before I</v>

196
00:05:08.921 --> 00:05:10.660
<v Speaker 1>went onstage fucked me up.</v>

197
00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.920
<v Speaker 1>That was a big one.</v>

198
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.840
<v Speaker 1>That was probably the first one.</v>

199
00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:14.740
<v Speaker 1>Might have been the second one.</v>

200
00:05:14.741 --> 00:05:15.431
<v Speaker 1>It was all the same time.</v>

201
00:05:15.431 --> 00:05:16.264
<v Speaker 1>It was a slow learner,</v>

202
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:17.740
<v Speaker 1>but the other one was a,</v>

203
00:05:17.741 --> 00:05:18.940
<v Speaker 1>I went with uh,</v>

204
00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.893
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

205

211
00:05:24.431 --> 00:05:29.170
<v Speaker 1>And Jb and I were doing a college together in New Jersey and a JB was a,</v>

212
00:05:29.171 --> 00:05:30.130
<v Speaker 1>it was really hard to find.</v>

213
00:05:30.131 --> 00:05:30.830
<v Speaker 1>And J B,</v>

214
00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:31.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>he was running late,</v>

218
00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.240
<v Speaker 1>so they had me go on first.</v>

219
00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.050
<v Speaker 1>And I wasn't prepared because I was sitting in the Er there.</v>

220
00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.570
<v Speaker 1>They had a little rec room with a TV on and the TV was showing this documentary</v>

221
00:05:40.571 --> 00:05:41.770
<v Speaker 1>on the Malibu fires.</v>

222
00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:43.870
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

223
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.550
<v Speaker 1>it was so fucking depressing.</v>

224
00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.140
<v Speaker 1>It was the early nineties,</v>

225
00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:48.820
<v Speaker 1>and these people lost everything.</v>

226
00:05:48.821 --> 00:05:50.260
<v Speaker 1>And this guy was crimes,</v>

227
00:05:50.261 --> 00:05:53.770
<v Speaker 1>a fireman and he was crying and wheat and his house was still there,</v>

228
00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:55.630
<v Speaker 1>but his neighbors had lost their houses.</v>

229
00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:57.160
<v Speaker 1>And he was just crying,</v>

230
00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.591
<v Speaker 1>weeping.</v>

231
00:05:57.591 --> 00:05:59.090
<v Speaker 1>This girl was looking for her dog.</v>

232
00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.990
<v Speaker 1>And they like,</v>

233
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.261
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

234
00:06:00.261 --> 00:06:00.651

<v Speaker 1>So what we're gonna do is we're gonna put you on and you do your sat and then</v>

237
00:06:05.901 --> 00:06:06.800
<v Speaker 1>he'll go on after you.</v>

238
00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.670
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

239
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:08.750
<v Speaker 1>oh no.</v>

240
00:06:08.751 --> 00:06:11.720
<v Speaker 1>So I went on stage thinking about this guy crying,</v>

241
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.220
<v Speaker 1>not even for his own loss,</v>

242
00:06:13.221 --> 00:06:14.510
<v Speaker 1>but for his neighbors loss.</v>

243
00:06:14.511 --> 00:06:15.950
<v Speaker 1>And that girl looking for a dog.</v>

244
00:06:15.951 --> 00:06:20.951
<v Speaker 1>And I just got so sad and I went on stage at age shit when I was in high school.</v>

245
00:06:21.141 --> 00:06:21.411
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

246
00:06:21.411 --> 00:06:22.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember the kid's name,</v>

247
00:06:22.581 --> 00:06:24.470
<v Speaker 1>but someone wrote a really cool article,</v>

248
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:25.011
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

249
00:06:25.011 --> 00:06:25.401
<v Speaker 1>one of the,</v>

250
00:06:25.401 --> 00:06:26.750
<v Speaker 1>one of the kids in my school,</v>

251
00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:27.161
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

252
00:06:27.161 --> 00:06:29.270
<v Speaker 1>about boy scouts,</v>

253
00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:31.190
<v Speaker 1>about the problem with the whole,</v>

254
00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:31.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

255
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.930
<v Speaker 1>the code of the boy scouts because one of them was keeping your thoughts clean.</v>

256
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:36.550
<v Speaker 1>Those that,</v>

257
00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:36.800
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

258
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:37.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

259
00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.510
<v Speaker 1>I forget the exact,</v>

260
00:06:38.511 --> 00:06:38.810
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

261
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:40.760
<v Speaker 1>let's put a boy scout code.</v>

262
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:43.220
<v Speaker 1>So you get to thinking about something and you're like,</v>

263
00:06:43.221 --> 00:06:43.491
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

264
00:06:43.491 --> 00:06:44.470
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't be thinking about that.</v>

265
00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:46.910
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

266
00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:47.960
<v Speaker 1>this guy was,</v>

267
00:06:47.961 --> 00:06:48.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

268
00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:49.610
<v Speaker 1>the guy who wrote this.</v>

269
00:06:49.611 --> 00:06:51.170
<v Speaker 1>I remember reading this as I was,</v>

270
00:06:51.171 --> 00:06:51.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

271
00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:52.091
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

272
00:06:52.091 --> 00:06:53.210
<v Speaker 1>a high school student going,</v>

273
00:06:53.211 --> 00:06:54.560
<v Speaker 1>this guy's got a really good fucking point.</v>

274
00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:56.210
<v Speaker 1>The point was like,</v>

275
00:06:56.211 --> 00:06:56.961
<v Speaker 1>what do you give a fuck?</v>

276
00:06:56.961 --> 00:06:59.390
<v Speaker 1>What I think like why are you trying to control my thoughts?</v>

277
00:06:59.391 --> 00:07:00.440
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm not hurting anybody.</v>

278
00:07:00.441 --> 00:07:02.600
<v Speaker 1>I might think something crazy and deviant,</v>

279
00:07:02.601 --> 00:07:05.420
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not doing it if as long as I'm not doing it.</v>

280
00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:05.660
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

281
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.340
<v Speaker 1>why am I supposed to keep my thoughts pure?</v>

282
00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:10.140
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's fun for me to entertain ridiculous thoughts.</v>

283
00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:10.881
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

284
00:07:10.881 --> 00:07:12.920
<v Speaker 1>Cause that's Kinda like what self control is.</v>

285
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:16.780
<v Speaker 1>Like self control doesn't speak to that thought.</v>

286
00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.690
<v Speaker 1>The idea is you entertain SelfControl speaks to or it's like you get an email</v>

287
00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:21.620
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>

288
00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:23.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to write a really mean email back.</v>

289
00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:24.370
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

290
00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:24.860
<v Speaker 1>and then you,</v>

291
00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:26.870
<v Speaker 1>it's so fun to imagine what you're saying to me.</v>
