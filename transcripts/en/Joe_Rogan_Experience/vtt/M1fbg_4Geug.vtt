<v Speaker 1>12 in it,</v>

77
00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:09.001
<v Speaker 1>and this quarter's eps mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a mushroom that these people </v>

78
00:03:09.001 --> 00:03:12.880
<v Speaker 1>like high altitudes founded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cattle were eating and it was making</v>

79
00:03:12.881 --> 00:03:16.300
<v Speaker 1>them more active so people started </v>
<v Speaker 1>supplementing their diet with it.</v>

80
00:03:16.301 --> 00:03:19.870
<v Speaker 1>And this mushroom apparently helps you </v>
<v Speaker 1>process oxygen.</v>

81
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:20.380
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what I'm saying?</v>

82
00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.110
<v Speaker 1>He's tired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm always tired.</v>

83
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.340
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sleep apnea thing,</v>

84
00:03:24.341 --> 00:03:29.341
<v Speaker 1>have you got that workout?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I got like the thing you </v>

85
00:03:29.341 --> 00:03:29.341
<v Speaker 1>suggested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mouth guard and helps,</v>

86
00:03:29.341 --> 00:03:32.140
<v Speaker 1>but I may have central sleep apnea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is when your brain just is fucking</v>

87
00:03:32.141 --> 00:03:35.620
<v Speaker 1>forgets to send the signal and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I might need the,</v>

88
00:03:35.621 --> 00:03:37.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and get the machine,</v>

89
00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:39.010
<v Speaker 1>but I can't use it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just can't do it.</v>

90
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.690
<v Speaker 1>Like I slept for like nine hours last </v>
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>

91
00:03:40.691 --> 00:03:45.691
<v Speaker 1>I'm just exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But maybe I think I might have maybe </v>

92
00:03:45.691 --> 00:03:45.691
<v Speaker 1>have a deficiency somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A beach while I've been thinking about.</v>

93
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.700
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think most people don't get the proper</v>

94
00:03:48.701 --> 00:03:51.580
<v Speaker 1>amount of vitamins from their diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be nice if we did.</v>

95
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideally you would not want to take </v>

96
00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:56.760
<v Speaker 1>supplements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

97
00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:56.760
<v Speaker 1>except uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

98
00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.940
<v Speaker 1>I guess you would want to maybe to maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>take nootropics or maybe take like for </v>

99
00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.420
<v Speaker 1>some things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you wanted to like a lot of B,</v>

100
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.450
<v Speaker 1>12,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not really gonna get the kind of </v>

101
00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:09.090
<v Speaker 1>volume in an injectable b 12 or you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

102
00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.500
<v Speaker 1>even though an oral [inaudible] from </v>
<v Speaker 1>your diet,</v>

103
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.780
<v Speaker 1>like you'd have to eat like a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>food to get it.</v>

104
00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.540
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

105
00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.780
<v Speaker 1>it's really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think be 12 comes from animal </v>

106
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.780
<v Speaker 1>protein to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I don't,</v>

107
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.580
<v Speaker 1>I might be wrong about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it okay to get it injected?</v>

108
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:22.930
<v Speaker 1>I might've made that up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should google it,</v>

109
00:04:22.931 --> 00:04:24.910
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know how to use this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of people are doing.</v>

110
00:04:24.911 --> 00:04:25.880
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

111
00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

112
00:04:26.621 --> 00:04:27.370
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's okay.</v>

113
00:04:27.371 --> 00:04:28.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not poison.</v>

114
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not,</v>

115
00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.260
<v Speaker 1>you're not injecting toxic amounts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

116
00:04:32.261 --> 00:04:34.360
<v Speaker 1>There's certain vitamins where you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be careful.</v>

117
00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:35.180
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

00:05:25.931 --> 00:05:30.931
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what you're eating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think you're like super </v>

<v Speaker 2>Right east.</v>

140
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.520

<v Speaker 2>our diets,</v>

141
00:05:36.521 --> 00:05:39.280
<v Speaker 2>if you just look at what you're eating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're missing a lot of shit.</v>

142
00:05:39.281 --> 00:05:41.020
<v Speaker 2>You're supposed to get on a regular </v>
<v Speaker 2>basis.</v>

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.610
<v Speaker 2>I need a multivitamin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to do that,</v>

144
00:05:42.611 --> 00:05:43.090

<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

145
00:05:43.091 --> 00:05:44.960
<v Speaker 2>I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it makes me nauseous if I don't each</v>

146
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.670
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

147
00:05:45.671 --> 00:05:50.671
<v Speaker 2>you should never take vitamins without </v>
<v Speaker 2>food because the vitamins are absorbed </v>

148
00:05:50.671 --> 00:05:51.340
<v Speaker 2>in your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You mean they have to be in,</v>

149
00:05:51.341 --> 00:05:51.400

<v Speaker 1>like all that stuff you don't get.</v>

152
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:03.220
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to get the full effect </v>
<v Speaker 1>from a vitamin if you just eat the </v>

153
00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:04.190
<v Speaker 1>vitamin like you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should eat vitamins always with food</v>

<v Speaker 1>You don't need a gym membership.</v>

206
00:08:29.751 --> 00:08:34.751
<v Speaker 1>You don't need shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need a backyard and some exercises </v>

207
00:08:34.751 --> 00:08:36.170
<v Speaker 1>and some black site or even you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>even need a back yard.</v>

208
00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.390
<v Speaker 1>If you have enough room inside your </v>
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

209
00:08:38.391 --> 00:08:40.040
<v Speaker 1>Like if you have a big room where you </v>

<v Speaker 1>he was like kind of taking it and </v>

213
00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:50.650
<v Speaker 1>letting us handle between his legs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is he working on there?</v>

214
00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:51.230
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's showing us.</v>

215
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:55.040
<v Speaker 1>The beautiful thing about kettlebells is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that everything you do,</v>

216
00:08:55.380 --> 00:09:00.380
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're working a bunch of different </v>

217
00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:00.380
<v Speaker 1>groups of muscles.</v>

218
00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:04.040
<v Speaker 1>You're not just what people think of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what does that exercise for your </v>

219
00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.100
<v Speaker 1>shoulders would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What an exercise should always really be</v>

220
00:09:05.101 --> 00:09:10.101
<v Speaker 1>for his functional movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should be enhancing your ability to </v>

221
00:09:10.101 --> 00:09:14.421
<v Speaker 1>move functionally and that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>always do that when you have like </v>

222
00:09:14.421 --> 00:09:17.270
<v Speaker 1>isolated exercises like curls are like </v>
<v Speaker 1>bench presses or shit like that.</v>

223
00:09:17.641 --> 00:09:20.640
<v Speaker 1>Like that's not really how the body is </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to work,</v>

224
00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:23.190
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your body supposed to work in a group,</v>

225
00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:24.940
<v Speaker 1>everything together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

226
00:09:24.941 --> 00:09:29.941
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I find is the most </v>

227
00:09:29.941 --> 00:09:31.980
<v Speaker 1>applicable to athletics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I started doing kettlebells I got,</v>

228
00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:37.010
<v Speaker 1>I just got a lot stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a lot stronger as far as my </v>

229
00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:38.190
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu and my wind got better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>

230
00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:39.740
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my ability to,</v>

231
00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:42.640
<v Speaker 1>to like push a pace got better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you get it,</v>

232
00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:47.040
<v Speaker 1>you get a muscular endurance from kettle</v>
<v Speaker 1>bells that's very rare,</v>

233
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:52.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing other kinds of exercises and you </v>

234
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:52.190
<v Speaker 1>get big from it too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

235
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:53.500
<v Speaker 1>And you don't have to do it that often.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

236
00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:55.290
<v Speaker 1>these are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a brutal workout.</v>

237
00:09:55.291 --> 00:09:58.800
<v Speaker 1>It's so hard that it breaks your tissue </v>
<v Speaker 1>down and then,</v>

238
00:09:58.801 --> 00:10:03.801
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need a few days off before you can </v>

239
00:10:03.801 --> 00:10:03.801
<v Speaker 1>do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

240
00:10:03.801 --> 00:10:06.561
<v Speaker 1>you might be able to do something else </v>
<v Speaker 1>in between like some kickboxing or </v>

241
00:10:06.561 --> 00:10:10.131
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you're first starting to do </v>

242
00:10:10.131 --> 00:10:11.990
<v Speaker 1>kettlebells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will be fucking amazed at how bad </v>

243
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:14.841
<v Speaker 1>you get your ass kicked by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One 35 pound kettle bell because you go </v>

244
00:10:14.841 --> 00:10:16.380
<v Speaker 1>through all these exercises and it feels</v>
<v Speaker 1>easy for the first,</v>

245
00:10:16.381 --> 00:10:18.720
<v Speaker 1>like 15 seconds and then you realize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

246
00:10:18.721 --> 00:10:20.980
<v Speaker 1>you got like seven more minutes to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

247
00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:22.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are metal,</v>

248
00:10:22.291 --> 00:10:24.420
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How solid iron.</v>

249
00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:28.290
<v Speaker 1>Those are solid iron kettle bells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have them in my gym.</v>

250
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:29.700
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should probably use them,</v>

251
00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:34.110
<v Speaker 1>but they're awesome to keep until the </v>
<v Speaker 1>elliptical Joe fucking great too,</v>

252
00:10:34.111 --> 00:10:34.410
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

253
00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:38.910
<v Speaker 1>I have a workout I do on the elliptical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is an unbelievably hard.</v>

254
00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:41.760
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do a warm up for like 10 minutes.</v>

255
00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:45.870
<v Speaker 1>And then I do these sprints of 30 </v>
<v Speaker 1>seconds.</v>

256
00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:50.280
<v Speaker 1>As hard as I can go at a high level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

257
00:10:50.281 --> 00:10:54.060
<v Speaker 1>as literally as hard as I can go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm running for my fucking life.</v>

258
00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:56.910
<v Speaker 1>And then take 30 seconds off in 30 </v>
<v Speaker 1>seconds just,</v>

259
00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:58.470
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just try to catch your breath.</v>

260
00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:01.020
<v Speaker 1>Try to bring your heart rate down and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then go to war again.</v>

261
00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:03.240
<v Speaker 1>The next 30 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long do you do this?</v>

262
00:11:03.241 --> 00:11:04.620
<v Speaker 1>For?</v>
<v Speaker 1>As long as I can do it.</v>

263
00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:08.010
<v Speaker 1>Usually I get 10 to I can go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can do it 10 times.</v>

264
00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.380
<v Speaker 1>As hard as you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As hard as I can.</v>

265
00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:12.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that much.</v>

266
00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:15.480
<v Speaker 1>If I was an athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be pathetic.</v>

267
00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:17.100
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I was a professional athlete,</v>

268
00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:18.420
<v Speaker 1>you probably have a much better one than</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

269
00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:23.430
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an awesome workout and it really </v>

270
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:25.851
<v Speaker 1>applies to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to physical things like applies for me </v>

271
00:11:25.851 --> 00:11:26.610
<v Speaker 1>when I hit the bag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it applies for me to Jujitsu.</v>

272
00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:29.610
<v Speaker 1>Like I can see that I can improve my </v>
<v Speaker 1>cardio by doing that.</v>

273
00:11:29.611 --> 00:11:31.350
<v Speaker 1>So people like make fun of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>elliptical,</v>

274
00:11:31.351 --> 00:11:34.830
<v Speaker 1>but you can work your fucking ass off in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the elliptical.</v>

275
00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:37.710
<v Speaker 1>You just have to decide either you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to decide how to do it.</v>

276
00:11:37.711 --> 00:11:39.840
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can go bananas on that thing and get</v>

277
00:11:39.841 --> 00:11:42.390
<v Speaker 1>an incredible workout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We also have,</v>

278
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:45.750
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we also have battle ropes.</v>

279
00:11:45.751 --> 00:11:50.751
<v Speaker 1>These are the latest and greatest </v>
<v Speaker 1>gadgets in the MMA training for like all</v>

280
00:11:51.781 --> 00:11:54.100
<v Speaker 1>these guys that are strength and </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditioning coaches,</v>

281
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:59.340
<v Speaker 3>a lot of them are using these huge ropes</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you manipulate and they call them </v>

282
00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:03.841
<v Speaker 3>battle ropes and the ones that we have </v>
<v Speaker 3>are 40 fucking feet long and you hurled </v>

283
00:12:03.851 --> 00:12:08.760
<v Speaker 3>these ropes up and down and it's an </v>
<v Speaker 3>incredible workout for your core and for</v>

284
00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:12.160
<v Speaker 3>your wind and for your grip strength,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your grip.</v>

285
00:12:12.161 --> 00:12:17.161
<v Speaker 3>It's so incredible for your grip </v>
<v Speaker 3>strength because you're connecting to </v>

286
00:12:17.161 --> 00:12:21.301
<v Speaker 3>this gigantic heavy moving object and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're swinging it with your whole body </v>

287
00:12:21.821 --> 00:12:25.240
<v Speaker 3>and not like a curl and not like doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>tricep extensions.</v>

288
00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:28.500
<v Speaker 3>That's like silly girly shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to get like a real</v>

289
00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:33.660

290
00:12:34.091 --> 00:12:39.091
<v Speaker 2>like this motherfucker and what you do </v>
<v Speaker 2>is fast forward a little so we can get </v>

291
00:12:39.091 --> 00:12:40.180
<v Speaker 2>to one of the exercises.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I doing it before.</v>

<v Speaker 2>but nothing like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your old arguments during mild arguments</v>

295
00:12:48.581 --> 00:12:49.630
<v Speaker 2>during.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>

296
00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:54.930
<v Speaker 2>It's not as good as these battle ropes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

362
00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:46.830
<v Speaker 1>I got chills just thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a great job man.</v>

363
00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:49.300
<v Speaker 1>It's the best job of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

364
00:15:49.301 --> 00:15:51.850
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's amazing that it exists.</v>

365
00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:52.820
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

366
00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:57.840
<v Speaker 1>when I first started doing me and data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've talked about this a bunch of </v>

367
00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:59.080
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We first started working for the UFC and</v>

368
00:15:59.081 --> 00:16:01.000
<v Speaker 1>you would tell people that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in it.</v>

369
00:16:01.001 --> 00:16:03.160
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like you're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>porn,</v>

370
00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:08.260
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what cage fighting was like and </v>

371
00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.270
<v Speaker 1>now it is just incredibly mainstream </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

372
00:16:10.271 --> 00:16:15.271
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an embarrassing thing for New York </v>

373
00:16:15.271 --> 00:16:16.450
<v Speaker 1>too that it's not legal there and we all</v>
<v Speaker 1>know other nonsense is going on,</v>

374
00:16:16.451 --> 00:16:17.540
<v Speaker 1>but it's embarrassing for Neela.</v>

375
00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:22.590
<v Speaker 1>It makes New York looked like this </v>
<v Speaker 1>irrelevant all old thinking place and </v>

376
00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:26.910
<v Speaker 1>the more boxing and I watched boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a great sport but I can't enjoy </v>

377
00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:28.060
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I enjoyed the UFC.</v>

378
00:16:28.061 --> 00:16:29.800
<v Speaker 1>It's really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like people get mad at me.</v>

379
00:16:29.801 --> 00:16:31.690
<v Speaker 1>I know and aches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm such a fucking whore for this,</v>

380
00:16:31.691 --> 00:16:36.691
<v Speaker 1>but it's like I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to hear about baseball </v>

381
00:16:36.691 --> 00:16:36.691
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of baseball players I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>met had been Dick's.</v>

382
00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:39.130
<v Speaker 1>A lot of football players had been </v>
<v Speaker 1>dicks,</v>

383
00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:41.770
<v Speaker 1>but at all the UFC guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're great.</v>

384
00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:46.790
<v Speaker 1>Like I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't met any of them that were </v>

385
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:46.790
<v Speaker 1>assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've met most of the big ones.</v>

386
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:49.120
<v Speaker 1>Every one of them is nice with the fans </v>
<v Speaker 1>and is nice to us when they come in.</v>

387
00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:51.160
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always said that people are.</v>

388
00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:56.200
<v Speaker 1>I think every man needs to learn at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least something about martial arts and </v>

389
00:16:56.831 --> 00:17:01.831
<v Speaker 1>something about how to defend yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get your that sorta chimpanzee </v>

390
00:17:03.491 --> 00:17:07.630
<v Speaker 1>bullshit out of your system that makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>most men become dicks.</v>

391
00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:12.900
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people are dicks simply</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're frustrated physically </v>

392
00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:16.640
<v Speaker 1>like their body feels like physically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like confined by its inaction,</v>

393
00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:23.790
<v Speaker 1>but confined by the stress of everyday </v>
<v Speaker 1>life and having to pay bills and just </v>

394
00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:29.730
<v Speaker 1>shit is always built up inside of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't do something to blow that </v>

395
00:17:29.831 --> 00:17:32.050
<v Speaker 1>out physically and balance your body </v>
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>

396
00:17:32.051 --> 00:17:37.051
<v Speaker 1>I think you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can have a hard time in this life </v>

397
00:17:37.051 --> 00:17:39.601
<v Speaker 1>and you can overreact to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could maybe be already be at a five </v>

398
00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:42.420
<v Speaker 1>and this guy says something and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>crank it up to eight and you're like,</v>

399
00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:43.610
<v Speaker 1>come off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

400
00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:46.300
<v Speaker 1>he yourself feel like a dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

401
00:17:46.301 --> 00:17:47.370
<v Speaker 1>why did I do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the.</v>

402
00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:49.410
<v Speaker 1>But you realize what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

403
00:17:49.411 --> 00:17:50.910
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're already wound up.</v>

404
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.310
<v Speaker 1>You don't even realize it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

405
00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:57.380
<v Speaker 1>you're going through life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wound up something like martial arts can</v>

406
00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:02.780
<v Speaker 1>get that out of your system called and </v>
<v Speaker 1>told me I'm a fucking car gangster </v>

407
00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:06.420
<v Speaker 1>because I talk so much shit in the car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a very reasonable and somebody </v>

408
00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:06.420
<v Speaker 1>is six three.</v>

409
00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:09.720
<v Speaker 1>He's a gangster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All is so fucking funny.</v>

410
00:18:09.721 --> 00:18:11.400
<v Speaker 1>It really is the fucking funniest guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>alive.</v>

411
00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:14.460
<v Speaker 1>He's so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's such a treasure.</v>

412
00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:18.180
<v Speaker 1>He's one of those guys that you like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to experience him live to,</v>

413
00:18:18.181 --> 00:18:20.060
<v Speaker 1>to get the full effect of his comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

414
00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:21.860
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he,</v>

415
00:18:21.861 --> 00:18:22.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did tough crowd.</v>

416
00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:28.130
<v Speaker 1>I never got a chance to see them live </v>
<v Speaker 1>that much because I was already living </v>

417
00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:29.460
<v Speaker 1>in La and he was almost always in New </v>
<v Speaker 1>York.</v>

418
00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:34.940
<v Speaker 1>But when we did a tough crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would go up and to stand up to the </v>

419
00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:36.090
<v Speaker 1>honest to God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forgot how funny he is.</v>

420
00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:36.780
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm with you.</v>

421
00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:37.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

422
00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:38.340
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we did it together.</v>

423
00:18:38.341 --> 00:18:39.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who else was on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>

424
00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:42.030
<v Speaker 1>He was so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

425
00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:43.240
<v Speaker 1>He just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because he.</v>

426
00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:44.760
<v Speaker 1>And here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll call them the amazing.</v>

427
00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:48.450
<v Speaker 1>It's like he never gets angry at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience are not going with them and I'm</v>

428
00:18:48.451 --> 00:18:49.080
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just,</v>

429
00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:50.040
<v Speaker 1>he addresses it.</v>

430
00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:53.520
<v Speaker 1>All right folks just plow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he doesn't.</v>

431
00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:58.790
<v Speaker 1>And Louise in a weird way the same way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they throw out what they throw out </v>

432
00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:02.271
<v Speaker 1>and they don't react emotionally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They allowed the audience to have their </v>

433
00:19:02.271 --> 00:19:03.360
<v Speaker 1>own emotion and that's a weakness in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>performance is I try to fucking.</v>

434
00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:06.600
<v Speaker 1>I bring the emotion and it's just like </v>
<v Speaker 1>he did it all for a stupid.</v>

435
00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:09.840
<v Speaker 1>It's not having no faith in the words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I'm saying to myself.</v>

436
00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:14.430
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of a cro me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a fine line between like I would</v>

437
00:19:14.431 --> 00:19:19.431
<v Speaker 1>hear that Jay Leno would go and work out</v>
<v Speaker 1>his monologue and he would do it flat </v>

438
00:19:19.431 --> 00:19:21.780
<v Speaker 1>and he did it on purpose that way we'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>work it out.</v>

439
00:19:21.781 --> 00:19:26.781
<v Speaker 1>The comedy Magic Club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would do those jokes on purpose flat </v>

440
00:19:26.781 --> 00:19:26.790
<v Speaker 1>because he didn't want to have to jazz </v>
<v Speaker 1>them up.</v>

441
00:19:26.791 --> 00:19:31.791
<v Speaker 1>He didn't want to say you wanted to find</v>
<v Speaker 1>out if the concept on its own is good </v>

442
00:19:31.791 --> 00:19:34.530
<v Speaker 1>and from there you can jazz it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's a gross feeling.</v>

443
00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:37.050
<v Speaker 1>When you're trying to jazz something up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of artificially.</v>

444
00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:42.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I prefer to work out material the same </v>

445
00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:44.451
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what a pompous ass comic </v>

446
00:19:44.451 --> 00:19:46.071
<v Speaker 1>would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I really do it the seller with no </v>

447
00:19:46.071 --> 00:19:46.920
<v Speaker 1>energy completely deadpan and just see </v>
<v Speaker 1>how the words work without with.</v>

448
00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:51.980
<v Speaker 1>Because you don't want to get a laugh </v>
<v Speaker 1>going whatever face you make like a </v>

449
00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:57.740
<v Speaker 1>fucking rye look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want it to be funny because it's </v>

450
00:19:57.740 --> 00:19:57.740
<v Speaker 1>funny but it's hard to do that because </v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

451
00:19:57.740 --> 00:20:00.030
<v Speaker 1>it bombs a lot of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you write?</v>

452
00:20:00.031 --> 00:20:03.900
<v Speaker 1>Do you write your material?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like do you like get an idea and say,</v>

453
00:20:03.901 --> 00:20:08.901
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we sit down and think of how I </v>

454
00:20:08.901 --> 00:20:09.420
<v Speaker 1>would put this idea to the audience or </v>
<v Speaker 1>do you.</v>

455
00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:12.990
<v Speaker 1>Do you like blogs and pull your jokes </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of it?</v>

456
00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:15.150
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want a lot of guys do it.</v>

457
00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:17.160
<v Speaker 1>I just go on because I'm at the cellar </v>
<v Speaker 1>every night,</v>

458
00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:22.340

460
00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:25.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm done with that fucking hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I want to start over because anymore </v>

461
00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:25.680
<v Speaker 1>that doing that material again is </v>
<v Speaker 1>repulsive to me.</v>

462
00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:28.770
<v Speaker 1>Never want to say those words again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fucking hate it.</v>

463
00:20:28.771 --> 00:20:30.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm sick of watching it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they did it.</v>

464
00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:36.270
<v Speaker 1>So now I want to do something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So thank God Travolta had all this </v>

465
00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:39.081
<v Speaker 1>malarkey happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I just went on and started talking </v>

466
00:20:39.081 --> 00:20:39.081
<v Speaker 1>about Travolta and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

467
00:20:39.081 --> 00:20:41.560
<v Speaker 1>trying to grab guys Cox to the thing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had fun with it and then I,</v>

468
00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:46.570
<v Speaker 1>I kind of built it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was waiting to hear what your take on </v>

469
00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:46.620
<v Speaker 1>it would be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as I saw it in the news,</v>

470
00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:48.040
<v Speaker 1>I said I would love</v>

471
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:52.810
<v Speaker 5>to talk to Jimmy about this because on </v>
<v Speaker 5>one hand you got to say,</v>

472
00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:58.110
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there got to be a lot of guys who just </v>

473
00:20:58.110 --> 00:20:58.240
<v Speaker 5>sucked his dick because he was doing it </v>
<v Speaker 5>that often.</v>

474
00:20:58.510 --> 00:21:01.340
<v Speaker 5>If he was pulling it out that often on </v>
<v Speaker 5>these [inaudible] I,</v>

475
00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:06.360
<v Speaker 5>I bet it's probably because there's a </v>
<v Speaker 5>bunch of them were jumped on that </v>

476
00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:07.300
<v Speaker 5>grenade.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you know how many.</v>

477
00:21:07.301 --> 00:21:08.620
<v Speaker 5>Whose fault is that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

478
00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:13.740
<v Speaker 5>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't fault him because I couldn't </v>

479
00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:13.740
<v Speaker 5>believe I believed them though because </v>
<v Speaker 5>the language,</v>

480
00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:17.970
<v Speaker 5>like I believe the one who accused Al </v>
<v Speaker 5>Gore because the language they use is </v>

481
00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:19.630
<v Speaker 5>language I've used.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like when he said that Al Gore,</v>

482
00:21:19.631 --> 00:21:22.600
<v Speaker 5>like the woman said that he said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>could you rub my receptors or whatever.</v>

483
00:21:22.601 --> 00:21:22.990
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

484
00:21:22.991 --> 00:21:27.991
<v Speaker 5>that's a typical fucking perv move.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You use our literal and appropriate </v>

485
00:21:29.081 --> 00:21:31.840
<v Speaker 5>language so they can accuse you of </v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to get,</v>

486
00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:32.680
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Excuse me,</v>

487
00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:35.380
<v Speaker 5>would you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>would you mind rubbing my chakras?</v>

488
00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:37.180
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and we both know what I'm saying,</v>

489
00:21:37.181 --> 00:21:38.380
<v Speaker 5>but she can't get mad at you.</v>

490
00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:43.610
<v Speaker 6>My Dad,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when I was a kid,</v>

491
00:21:43.611 --> 00:21:44.420
<v Speaker 6>my dad always said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>

492
00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:46.070
<v Speaker 6>that's your paper.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Every time I was like,</v>

493
00:21:46.071 --> 00:21:51.071
<v Speaker 6>what's this?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then it was like I was in fifth </v>

494
00:21:51.071 --> 00:21:51.071
<v Speaker 6>grade.</v>

495
00:21:51.071 --> 00:21:53.710
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well you're talking about should </v>

496
00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:55.760
<v Speaker 5>probably avoid saying suck my paper </v>
<v Speaker 5>because I think that would be easy to </v>

497
00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:56.130
<v Speaker 5>decipher.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think you'd have to call him the</v>

498
00:21:56.131 --> 00:22:01.131
<v Speaker 5>fucking guys who broke the Jap code to </v>
<v Speaker 5>figure out how to put a paper is.</v>

499
00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:04.680
<v Speaker 5>Well your honor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we can't say for sure.</v>

500
00:22:04.681 --> 00:22:07.970
<v Speaker 5>It was his penis sucked my paper.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was very ambiguous.</v>

501
00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:09.810
<v Speaker 5>It could be anything,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I still use it now.</v>

502
00:22:09.811 --> 00:22:11.740
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I use it with girls that do you really,</v>

503
00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:16.880
<v Speaker 5>for some reason the two of you playing </v>
<v Speaker 5>with your nipples and you look down and </v>

504
00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:20.391
<v Speaker 5>just just tell her to kiss your people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's even creepier and more childlike </v>

505
00:22:20.391 --> 00:22:23.330
<v Speaker 5>noodles or kissimmee paper may present </v>
<v Speaker 5>my noodles.</v>

506
00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:25.440
<v Speaker 5>I know I never used words I never asked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

507
00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:28.150
<v Speaker 5>I do this silent and it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was going to do some of this on,</v>

508
00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:33.170
<v Speaker 5>on Leno tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I just said I had to bail on a </v>

509
00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:33.170
<v Speaker 5>little bit because I was on with Justin </v>
<v Speaker 5>Bieber.</v>

510
00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:35.280
<v Speaker 5>It was all fucking 15 year old girls and</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

511
00:22:35.281 --> 00:22:40.281
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They've never gotten a happy ending </v>

512
00:22:40.281 --> 00:22:40.281
<v Speaker 5>massage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

513
00:22:40.281 --> 00:22:40.281
<v Speaker 5>so I kind of bailed on the sosh drove </v>
<v Speaker 5>ultimate cheer.</v>

514
00:22:40.281 --> 00:22:44.841
<v Speaker 5>I didn't do any of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a good move because you probably </v>

515
00:22:44.841 --> 00:22:47.271
<v Speaker 5>save the minds of all those different 15</v>
<v Speaker 5>year old kids from the creepy ideas you </v>

516
00:22:47.271 --> 00:22:51.801
<v Speaker 5>have that are based on truth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but all of a sudden they're going to be </v>

517
00:22:51.801 --> 00:22:52.920
<v Speaker 5>driving by these massage power's going,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which one of these jerk you off?</v>

518
00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:54.960
<v Speaker 5>Does that Daddy?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Does that one jerk guys off?</v>

519
00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:56.850
<v Speaker 5>Or even worse,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're gonna put on pulp fiction and go,</v>

520
00:22:56.851 --> 00:23:01.851
<v Speaker 5>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He grabbed the penis and then a couple </v>

521
00:23:01.851 --> 00:23:03.471
<v Speaker 5>of minutes later grabbed the scrotum.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wish I would have committed to the </v>

522
00:23:03.471 --> 00:23:06.291
<v Speaker 5>travolta stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm kind of mad at myself that I went </v>

523
00:23:06.291 --> 00:23:06.291
<v Speaker 5>away from it and I just wanted to stop.</v>

524
00:23:06.291 --> 00:23:09.760
<v Speaker 6>Do you see what Letterman did?</v>
<v Speaker 6>A bieber the other last week I heard it </v>

525
00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:09.760
<v Speaker 6>was uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

526
00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:10.540
<v Speaker 6>That was really what was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

527
00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:11.620
<v Speaker 6>he,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

528
00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:12.770
<v Speaker 6>we could probably show it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he,</v>

529
00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:17.780
<v Speaker 6>he got a new tattoo and then letterman </v>
<v Speaker 6>was kind of acting weird and then tried </v>

530
00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:19.080
<v Speaker 6>to grab his tattoo and he had just got </v>
<v Speaker 6>it done.</v>

531
00:23:19.081 --> 00:23:21.200
<v Speaker 6>So it was like bloody and stuff and he </v>
<v Speaker 6>wouldn't.</v>

532
00:23:21.201 --> 00:23:22.350
<v Speaker 6>He was.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And B was like,</v>

533
00:23:22.351 --> 00:23:22.890
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>stop,</v>

534
00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:23.880
<v Speaker 6>stop,</v>
<v Speaker 6>stop,</v>

535
00:23:23.881 --> 00:23:28.881
<v Speaker 6>stop.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But he wouldn't stop like that extra </v>

536
00:23:28.881 --> 00:23:31.311
<v Speaker 6>second and then it was just like a </v>
<v Speaker 6>beaver mispronounce something and then </v>

537
00:23:32.101 --> 00:23:32.700
<v Speaker 6>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

538
00:23:32.701 --> 00:23:37.701
<v Speaker 6>that's Canadian high school for you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But the whole attitude of the whole </v>

539
00:23:37.701 --> 00:23:37.701
<v Speaker 6>thing seemed very good</v>

540
00:23:37.701 --> 00:23:38.550
<v Speaker 5>in chapel.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

541
00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:40.310
<v Speaker 5>The crowd was the crowd with them where </v>
<v Speaker 5>they call.</v>

542
00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:42.050
<v Speaker 5>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We could watch it if you want to.</v>

543
00:23:42.051 --> 00:23:42.960
<v Speaker 5>I'll find out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm serious.</v>

544
00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:46.010
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what was the problem he had with</v>

545
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:51.010
<v Speaker 1>them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it just he didn't want to be </v>

546
00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:51.010
<v Speaker 1>interviewing Justin Bieber's I wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>

547
00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:54.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he was just trying to act like </v>

548
00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:56.651
<v Speaker 1>the old man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the old grumpy dad that started coming </v>

549
00:23:56.651 --> 00:23:57.650
<v Speaker 1>like just had a weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a weird sometimes man,</v>

550
00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:02.660
<v Speaker 1>you just can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't jibe with someone you don't </v>

551
00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:02.860
<v Speaker 1>realize until you're out there talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>to them,</v>

552
00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:04.270
<v Speaker 1>but you're fighting for your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

553
00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:07.260
<v Speaker 1>I had to get off a conversation and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

554
00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:10.700
<v Speaker 1>as comics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we've all gone for something that</v>

555
00:24:10.701 --> 00:24:13.940
<v Speaker 1>was just ridiculous in hindsight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the moment,</v>

556
00:24:13.941 --> 00:24:18.941
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think that would be funny if I grab </v>

557
00:24:18.941 --> 00:24:18.941
<v Speaker 1>his tattoo and just fucking hold onto </v>
<v Speaker 1>the little fog that it just gets cricket</v>

558
00:24:18.941 --> 00:24:23.350
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to let go and come back to my </v>

559
00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:23.350
<v Speaker 1>seat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he'll laugh and think like,</v>

560
00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:23.350
<v Speaker 1>who?</v>

561
00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:26.300
<v Speaker 1>Like what does he do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does he try to get inside the mindset of</v>

562
00:24:26.301 --> 00:24:29.240
<v Speaker 1>a Justin Bieber who is further for them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Justin Bieber.</v>

563
00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:34.300
<v Speaker 1>Then David Letterman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human spectrum in the United States of </v>

564
00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:35.300
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty fucking Goddamn far apart,</v>

565
00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:40.450
<v Speaker 1>but he probably doesn't even think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He probably just does what he wants to </v>

566
00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:40.450
<v Speaker 1>do without fear of it not working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>

567
00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:44.500
<v Speaker 1>Why let him into it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He probably is not afraid there's not </v>

568
00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:44.500
<v Speaker 1>going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

569
00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:44.500
<v Speaker 1>It just gives it a shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was worried though.</v>

570
00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:46.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like 20 years of stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Finally.</v>

571
00:24:46.431 --> 00:24:49.070
<v Speaker 1>I was able to adjust and make it a </v>
<v Speaker 1>decent appearance,</v>

572
00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:51.320
<v Speaker 1>but it was like that could've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking death.</v>

573
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.650
<v Speaker 1>Cookies was we went to break because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>did better than I thought you'd do,</v>

574
00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:57.110
<v Speaker 1>which made me kind of laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Funny.</v>

575
00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:58.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

576
00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:03.880
<v Speaker 1>I've done those shows at the improv </v>
<v Speaker 1>before where they have some sort of a </v>

577
00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:07.331
<v Speaker 1>high school tour and you look out there </v>
<v Speaker 1>and at the Improv and a professional </v>

<v Speaker 1>what's going on here?</v>

581
00:25:11.501 --> 00:25:12.150

<v Speaker 1>what am I going to do that?</v>

582
00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:16.190

<v Speaker 1>It was ridiculous.</v>

583
00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:17.960
<v Speaker 1>Our.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He went up and I was like,</v>

584
00:25:17.961 --> 00:25:19.790
<v Speaker 1>did you go extra dirty for those kids?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

585
00:25:19.791 --> 00:25:23.120
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean people were freaking out.</v>

588
00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:30.290

<v Speaker 1>you're literally talking about the first</v>

589
00:25:30.291 --> 00:25:33.530
<v Speaker 1>time a kid has ever heard anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>remotely like that.</v>

590
00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:37.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean when you're 13 and 14,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when we did these shows,</v>

591
00:25:37.791 --> 00:25:39.300
<v Speaker 1>it was a few years back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

592
00:25:39.770 --> 00:25:44.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many kids were getting online but </v>

593
00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:44.770
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to see,</v>

594
00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:50.430
<v Speaker 1>to watch comedy online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to see it like live and in person </v>

595
00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:51.500
<v Speaker 1>like that here it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had never experienced anything like</v>

596
00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:54.890
<v Speaker 1>a standup comic doing a dirty act in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>nightclub in Hollywood.</v>

597
00:25:54.891 --> 00:25:55.880
<v Speaker 1>Like they were blown away.</v>

598
00:25:55.880 --> 00:26:00.880
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well these were all girls who were 15 </v>

<v Speaker 1>Screaming fucking.</v>

601
00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:04.670
<v Speaker 1>It's uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

602
00:26:04.671 --> 00:26:09.671
<v Speaker 1>I'll never know what that's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They actually made them do it for me </v>

603
00:26:09.671 --> 00:26:09.671

<v Speaker 1>it felt nice as a nice for once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I knew it wasn't sincere.</v>

<v Speaker 1>watching that as a comic?</v>

644
00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:05.120
<v Speaker 1>When he said Sixteenth Chapel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could watch letterman as a comedian </v>

645
00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:06.990
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh God just gave me that.</v>

646
00:28:07.030 --> 00:28:10.290
<v Speaker 1>You relish the moment and he knew it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to get a laugh,</v>

647
00:28:10.291 --> 00:28:12.120
<v Speaker 1>whatever he said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was great.</v>

648
00:28:12.121 --> 00:28:12.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was very funny.</v>

649
00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:15.030
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think there was anything wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>with that at all.</v>

650
00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:15.510
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

651
00:28:15.511 --> 00:28:16.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what people are saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

652
00:28:16.521 --> 00:28:19.990
<v Speaker 1>they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They attacked that Bieber fans.</v>

653
00:28:20.450 --> 00:28:21.520
<v Speaker 1>Fans are silly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You look,</v>

654

<v Speaker 1>Beaverton too upset by it.</v>

656
00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:29.960
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he seemed like he went with the flow </v>

657
00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:29.960
<v Speaker 1>really well and I thought that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>really funny.</v>

658
00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:30.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why anybody would have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem with that.</v>

659
00:28:30.151 --> 00:28:32.730
<v Speaker 1>That was just letterman being letterman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the best man.</v>

660
00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:34.020
<v Speaker 1>What would you do in that situation?</v>

661
00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:35.330
<v Speaker 1>Would you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were like on pet,</v>

662
00:28:35.370 --> 00:28:38.100
<v Speaker 1>would you commit to the stuff or hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what I was going to talk about,</v>

663
00:28:38.101 --> 00:28:39.630
<v Speaker 1>or would you like make an adjustment of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your head?</v>

664
00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:41.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like doing those.</v>

665
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.260
<v Speaker 1>I got to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

666
00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:45.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's this,</v>

667
00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:49.860
<v Speaker 1>it's a craft in itself constructing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>five minute set for,</v>

668
00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:54.880
<v Speaker 1>for talk shows and there's totally </v>
<v Speaker 1>different like line of standup comedy.</v>

669
00:28:55.870 --> 00:29:00.870
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's your standup comedy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's these weird portal </v>

670
00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:04.440
<v Speaker 1>stops that you do and one of them is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>five minute set on a tonight show.</v>

671
00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:09.990
<v Speaker 1>Squeaky clean or least except for like </v>
<v Speaker 1>some innuendo but nothing too crazy.</v>

672
00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:13.710
<v Speaker 1>Nothing political,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing really ultra controversial,</v>

673
00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:14.970
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And No,</v>

674
00:29:14.971 --> 00:29:17.880
<v Speaker 1>no ability to expand upon anything for </v>
<v Speaker 1>five minutes.</v>

675
00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:19.950
<v Speaker 1>It's so quick know you're in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're out.</v>

676
00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:24.980
<v Speaker 1>You just got to get a few points across </v>
<v Speaker 1>real quick and all your best bets are </v>

677
00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:26.250
<v Speaker 1>two and a half minutes long.</v>

678
00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:29.610
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like you're going to do two </v>
<v Speaker 1>bits and then bail.</v>

679
00:29:29.611 --> 00:29:34.070
<v Speaker 1>So you're going to kind of chop stuff up</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit or construct a set for,</v>

680
00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:35.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

681
00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:40.620
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't even show a clip from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>special they want to when I show a clip </v>

682
00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:40.620
<v Speaker 1>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

683
00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:41.950
<v Speaker 1>like what do I do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing about Sharpton dying,</v>

684
00:29:41.951 --> 00:29:43.590
<v Speaker 1>do I do the thing about the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>Moscow,</v>

685
00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:47.140
<v Speaker 1>none of that will work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we showed a promo for the special,</v>

686
00:29:47.141 --> 00:29:52.141
<v Speaker 1>which it was a very funny promo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the standup itself I couldn't show </v>

687
00:29:52.141 --> 00:29:52.570
<v Speaker 1>because I knew none of it would play and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all too fucking long.</v>

688
00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:55.780
<v Speaker 1>It's all more than 40 seconds of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you have points,</v>

689
00:29:55.781 --> 00:29:57.790
<v Speaker 1>you have points of view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have ideas.</v>

690
00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:01.120
<v Speaker 1>It's real hard to express any of that in</v>
<v Speaker 1>five minutes.</v>

691
00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:03.520
<v Speaker 1>I found that every like short set that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever did,</v>

692
00:30:03.521 --> 00:30:04.330
<v Speaker 1>I just felt like shit.</v>

693
00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:09.720
<v Speaker 1>That makes me feel good to hear you say </v>
<v Speaker 1>that though because it's like you feel </v>

694
00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:12.871
<v Speaker 1>like as a comic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like why can't I just go out there and </v>

695
00:30:12.871 --> 00:30:14.860
<v Speaker 1>fucking hit home runs when I do these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things for five or six minutes in the </v>

696
00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:14.860
<v Speaker 1>club either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's.</v>

697
00:30:14.930 --> 00:30:16.150
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is what it is.</v>

698
00:30:16.151 --> 00:30:21.151
<v Speaker 1>It's a great promotion of vehicle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously it's an honor to be on the </v>

699
00:30:21.151 --> 00:30:21.400
<v Speaker 1>tonight show as always and when you do a</v>
<v Speaker 1>set,</v>

700
00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:23.800
<v Speaker 1>definitely people are going to see it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's going to help your career.</v>

701
00:30:23.801 --> 00:30:26.550
<v Speaker 1>No doubt about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a bet,</v>

702
00:30:26.610 --> 00:30:28.900
<v Speaker 1>a really good representation of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>standup,</v>

703
00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:31.450
<v Speaker 1>a good representation of your standup is</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a club,</v>

704
00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:32.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's really what we do.</v>

705
00:30:32.770 --> 00:30:34.090
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even theater,</v>

706
00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:39.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean theater is great because you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>get more people to come out and see you </v>

707
00:30:39.230 --> 00:30:39.230
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you still still can be a lot of fun,</v>

708
00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:44.430
<v Speaker 1>but ideally if a theater is at nine </v>
<v Speaker 1>point nine of a comedy clubs at 10.</v>

709
00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:46.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

710
00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:48.310
<v Speaker 1>It's only a little bit less to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

711
00:30:48.311 --> 00:30:53.311
<v Speaker 1>but a club like 200 seater man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know when you're right there and </v>

712
00:30:53.311 --> 00:30:57.361
<v Speaker 1>you're fucking it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're so tuned into the crowd and the </v>

713
00:30:57.361 --> 00:30:57.361
<v Speaker 1>crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

714
00:30:57.361 --> 00:30:58.240
<v Speaker 1>they're having so much fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the,</v>

715
00:30:58.241 --> 00:31:00.080
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount of laughs and the,</v>

716
00:31:00.330 --> 00:31:00.880
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

717
00:31:00.910 --> 00:31:01.340
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

718
00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:04.390
<v Speaker 1>the full energy you get of killing in </v>
<v Speaker 1>front of 200 people.</v>

719
00:31:04.391 --> 00:31:05.890
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

720
00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:09.190
<v Speaker 1>very few things in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are that powerful?</v>

721
00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:11.340
<v Speaker 1>Bounces back at you like you feel it </v>
<v Speaker 1>when it's again,</v>

722
00:31:11.341 --> 00:31:13.430
<v Speaker 1>it's a small room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the comedy cellar in New York.</v>

723
00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:16.690
<v Speaker 1>Just fuck it.</v>

728
00:31:23.681 --> 00:31:25.810

<v Speaker 1>but I didn't draw that right there.</v>

741
00:31:48.691 --> 00:31:48.691
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you do what Anthony's doing if</v>

742
00:31:48.691 --> 00:31:50.080
<v Speaker 1>you did your own podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it's hard because you're on.</v>

<v Speaker 1>free.</v>

747
00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:03.900
<v Speaker 1>They can get your show on Xm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they have to pay or they have to go </v>

748
00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:05.430
<v Speaker 1>illegal and go with tolerance and risk </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind,</v>

749
00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:07.680
<v Speaker 1>creeping up your ass asshole microscope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

750
00:32:07.730 --> 00:32:10.330

<v Speaker 1>it's like a gang of people.</v>

753
00:32:15.341 --> 00:32:17.140
<v Speaker 1>If you had your own podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was all you.</v>

754
00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:22.200
<v Speaker 1>Well I guess you do the music thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not a serious show too.</v>

755
00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:24.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm also,</v>

756
00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:29.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I'm allowed to </v>

757
00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:30.121
<v Speaker 1>contractually to be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might not be allowed to do a </v>

758
00:32:30.121 --> 00:32:30.430
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They allow me to perform on them.</v>

759
00:32:30.431 --> 00:32:35.431
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they'll allow me to </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually do one and market it as a Jim </v>

760
00:32:35.431 --> 00:32:35.431
<v Speaker 1>Norton vehicle because it's a different </v>
<v Speaker 1>platform.</v>

761
00:32:35.431 --> 00:32:36.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hm.</v>

762
00:32:36.730 --> 00:32:38.650
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they could play it,</v>

763
00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:40.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't see why they would have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem with it,</v>

764
00:32:40.431 --> 00:32:40.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if,</v>

765
00:32:41.390 --> 00:32:42.910
<v Speaker 1>if they also played it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

766
00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:45.140
<v Speaker 1>because that's what we do with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

767
00:32:45.150 --> 00:32:48.200
<v Speaker 1>we were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a broadcast and we're on Sirius.</v>

768
00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:50.810
<v Speaker 1>We go on to Onh right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we just,</v>

769
00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:52.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just give it to them,</v>

770
00:32:53.170 --> 00:32:58.170
<v Speaker 1>which is give it to them for free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just smart thing to do because </v>

771
00:32:58.170 --> 00:32:59.480
<v Speaker 1>you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody wants to pay for Shit and we want</v>

772
00:32:59.481 --> 00:33:01.340
<v Speaker 1>to do an on a podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we just put it up,</v>

773
00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:04.250
<v Speaker 1>give them an hour a week for free to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who aren't into the show,</v>

774
00:33:04.251 --> 00:33:06.150
<v Speaker 1>into the shell and mean expanding </v>
<v Speaker 1>marketing.</v>

775
00:33:06.151 --> 00:33:08.290
<v Speaker 1>Everybody understands why I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably could have just said that and</v>

776
00:33:08.291 --> 00:33:10.580
<v Speaker 1>not explained it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then some people think,</v>

777
00:33:10.581 --> 00:33:12.770
<v Speaker 1>well that's all they would need is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>hour a week.</v>

778
00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:17.800
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll just take that hour week and </v>

779
00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:17.800
<v Speaker 1>they'll add it to the five hours the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Corolla puts out,</v>

780
00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:18.360
<v Speaker 1>puts out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

781
00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:23.500
<v Speaker 1>a couple of hours a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mean if you really stop and think </v>

782
00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:23.500
<v Speaker 1>about how many great podcasts are out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there right now,</v>

783
00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:24.550
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

784
00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:29.860
<v Speaker 1>how many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many hours do you have to fucking </v>

785
00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:29.860
<v Speaker 1>know people.</v>

786
00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:30.890
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird sort of a situation where </v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets to.</v>

787
00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:36.190
<v Speaker 1>There's a saturation point where </v>
<v Speaker 1>especially ones like ours that are like </v>

788
00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:36.860
<v Speaker 1>three hours long sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it anyway?</v>

791
00:33:40.071 --> 00:33:41.960
<v Speaker 1>I think I starting up and trying to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

792
00:33:41.961 --> 00:33:43.870
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot harder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you have a trauma.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the high definition sound.</v>

825
00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:57.380
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the music is in.</v>

826
00:34:57.530 --> 00:35:02.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sounds really good when it comes </v>

827
00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:02.530
<v Speaker 1>through satellite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't sound like a radio.</v>

828
00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:02.670
<v Speaker 1>It sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds.</v>

829
00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:08.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's much better than radio sound and </v>

830
00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:08.300
<v Speaker 1>it's coming from the fucking sky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I totally support that.</v>

831
00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:11.150
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love the fact that I can just click on</v>

832
00:35:11.151 --> 00:35:14.150
<v Speaker 1>classic vinyl and then I hear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

833
00:35:14.170 --> 00:35:16.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the road again by Bob Seger,</v>

834
00:35:16.191 --> 00:35:16.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

835
00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:18.260
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

836
00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:20.420
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's worth it to me.</v>

837
00:35:20.421 --> 00:35:22.190
<v Speaker 1>It's totally worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>

838
00:35:22.210 --> 00:35:23.240
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys are on.</v>

839
00:35:23.241 --> 00:35:25.700
<v Speaker 1>I listened to Howard still at listened </v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

840
00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:26.530
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

841
00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:28.890
<v Speaker 1>I listened to Ron and Fez.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

842
00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:34.120
<v Speaker 1>it's totally worth it to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the Internet is the future and </v>

843
00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:39.670
<v Speaker 1>somehow know the Internet is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get into people's cars and when that </v>

844
00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:41.400
<v Speaker 1>happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when that happens,</v>

845
00:35:41.401 --> 00:35:42.750
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be real hard.</v>

846
00:35:42.810 --> 00:35:45.160
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be real hard to,</v>

847
00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:47.430
<v Speaker 1>to sell Internet radio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

848
00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:49.230
<v Speaker 1>It's going to just have to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>advertising base,</v>

849
00:35:49.310 --> 00:35:54.310
<v Speaker 1>like podcasts are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to have to change their </v>

850
00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:56.421
<v Speaker 1>business model to make money a different</v>
<v Speaker 1>way because you're not going to go to </v>

851
00:35:56.421 --> 00:35:57.240
<v Speaker 1>get him to fucking pay for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going to stop you?</v>

852
00:35:57.270 --> 00:35:59.520
<v Speaker 1>It's not just that they're going to stop</v>
<v Speaker 1>using it.</v>

853
00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:04.790
<v Speaker 1>Like why would they use it when you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like spotify and all these </v>

854
00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:06.060
<v Speaker 1>different ways of getting to tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have both right now,</v>

855
00:36:06.061 --> 00:36:11.061
<v Speaker 1>satellite radio and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and my iphone sets up where I have </v>

856
00:36:11.061 --> 00:36:11.790
<v Speaker 1>spotify or Pandora or anything like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

857
00:36:11.791 --> 00:36:13.230
<v Speaker 1>It's just easier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>

858
00:36:13.231 --> 00:36:13.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

859
00:36:13.870 --> 00:36:15.020
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

860
00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:20.380
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you still have to do shit with all the </v>

861
00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:20.380
<v Speaker 1>things that you have to type in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>station that you want if you're using,</v>

862
00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:23.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pandora or have to do that.</v>

863
00:36:23.410 --> 00:36:26.390
<v Speaker 1>There's more than just turning it on and</v>
<v Speaker 1>hitting a button and that's the,</v>

864
00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:31.420
<v Speaker 1>that's what's still going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I still use satellite radio more </v>

865
00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:33.590
<v Speaker 1>because I just turned it on and Bam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

866
00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:38.600
<v Speaker 1>I see what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's not too many steps to go </v>

867
00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:38.600
<v Speaker 1>through steps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

868
00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:42.261
<v Speaker 1>But that's going to change and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>less and less and less steps are </v>

869
00:36:42.261 --> 00:36:46.221
<v Speaker 1>happening as you go on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other thing is that you have to be </v>

870
00:36:46.221 --> 00:36:46.221
<v Speaker 1>with satellite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

871
00:36:46.221 --> 00:36:48.480
<v Speaker 1>you have to be in a place where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could see the satellite.</v>

872
00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:51.060
<v Speaker 1>That's why it dies out when you go into </v>
<v Speaker 1>bridges and shit,</v>

873
00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:56.480
<v Speaker 1>that's the internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the same way you go fucking </v>

874
00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:56.480
<v Speaker 1>someplaces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have any internet at all.</v>

875
00:36:56.480 --> 00:37:01.100
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's gonna be some places maybe </v>

876
00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:01.100
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

877
00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:04.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make any sense to still do </v>

878
00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:04.940
<v Speaker 1>the same thing regular radio get.</v>

879
00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:04.950
<v Speaker 1>They just put receivers in the Lincoln </v>
<v Speaker 1>tunnel and I can get fucking.</v>

880
00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:06.240
<v Speaker 1>You can listen to q one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

881
00:37:06.241 --> 00:37:11.241
<v Speaker 1>four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three in case you haven't heard Brown </v>

882
00:37:11.241 --> 00:37:11.241
<v Speaker 1>eyed girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Enough Time's gone into fucking jersey.</v>

883
00:37:11.241 --> 00:37:13.020
<v Speaker 1>Can you get a satellite radio under the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tongue?</v>

884
00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:14.370
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they could put in receivers.</v>

885
00:37:14.371 --> 00:37:15.570
<v Speaker 1>They probably don't feel it's worth it </v>
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>

886
00:37:15.571 --> 00:37:17.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real regular radio does,</v>

887
00:37:17.281 --> 00:37:20.230
<v Speaker 1>but they don't need to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They must hate the Internet to see what.</v>

888
00:37:20.290 --> 00:37:21.360
<v Speaker 1>Do they hate the Internet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

889
00:37:21.361 --> 00:37:22.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

890
00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:23.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

891
00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:28.010
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they understand what a promotional tool </v>

892
00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:29.721
<v Speaker 1>it can be too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean they understand that the </v>

893
00:37:29.721 --> 00:37:29.721
<v Speaker 1>threat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

894
00:37:29.721 --> 00:37:29.830
<v Speaker 1>it certainly is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once Wifi is and cars,</v>

895
00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:30.990
<v Speaker 1>everything's going to be in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

896
00:37:30.991 --> 00:37:35.991
<v Speaker 1>the thing is when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when serious first came out or when </v>

897
00:37:35.991 --> 00:37:35.991
<v Speaker 1>satellite radio in general first came </v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

898
00:37:35.991 --> 00:37:37.170
<v Speaker 1>it was really like a dream come true.</v>

899
00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:38.430
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

900
00:37:38.431 --> 00:37:41.340
<v Speaker 1>like I can get radio in my car that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>uncensored.</v>

901
00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:46.640
<v Speaker 1>Like somehow or another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some Bozo hasn't stepped in and made it </v>

902
00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:47.640
<v Speaker 1>so that if you say the wrong fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>noise with your mouth,</v>

903
00:37:47.641 --> 00:37:50.520
<v Speaker 1>you get locked up in a cage and they get</v>
<v Speaker 1>to forfeit,</v>

904
00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:55.700
<v Speaker 1>forfeit all your assets and that's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>nutty shit when it comes to censorship </v>

905
00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:58.110
<v Speaker 1>that people don't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how damaging that is.</v>

906
00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:00.780
<v Speaker 1>And in all the time that satellite radio</v>
<v Speaker 1>is bid on,</v>

907
00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:03.570
<v Speaker 1>how much different are things really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

908
00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:06.810
<v Speaker 1>it's not like anybody got hurt the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking people are listening to it.</v>

909
00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:09.690
<v Speaker 1>It's not like all of a sudden you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys being completely,</v>

910
00:38:09.691 --> 00:38:12.810
<v Speaker 1>totally honest with all the words that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd ever wanted to use.</v>

911
00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:14.310
<v Speaker 1>It's not like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden it started.</v>

912
00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:19.340
<v Speaker 1>People were running out in the streets </v>
<v Speaker 1>and fucking cutting off heads and </v>

913
00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:19.500
<v Speaker 1>jumping off bridges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing changed.</v>

914
00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:22.170
<v Speaker 1>Nothing changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So therefore it's bullshit.</v>

915
00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:27.200
<v Speaker 1>Therefore it's useless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like it's contributing to the </v>

916
00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:27.200
<v Speaker 1>downfall of society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

917
00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:28.200
<v Speaker 1>the FCC just lost a big case to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for Fox.</v>

918
00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:30.390
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they lost a huge fucking case.</v>

919
00:38:30.391 --> 00:38:35.391
<v Speaker 1>Mr Graham court about A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it was about just quick </v>

920
00:38:35.391 --> 00:38:35.391
<v Speaker 1>utterances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they they,</v>

921
00:38:35.391 --> 00:38:36.220
<v Speaker 1>they removed</v>

922
00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:41.220
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the fines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that Fox has got thrown out </v>

923
00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:43.011
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the FCC just to go and we knew they </v>

924
00:38:43.011 --> 00:38:43.011
<v Speaker 3>would because they're fucking greedy and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're talking.</v>

925
00:38:43.011 --> 00:38:47.310
<v Speaker 3>They won't just lay off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so creepy when they chased after </v>

926
00:38:47.310 --> 00:38:47.380
<v Speaker 3>stern when all that shit was in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>news,</v>

927
00:38:47.381 --> 00:38:52.381
<v Speaker 3>it was so creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It felt like it felt like good against </v>

928
00:38:52.381 --> 00:38:52.960
<v Speaker 3>evil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's really what it felt like.</v>

929
00:38:52.961 --> 00:38:57.961
<v Speaker 3>It felt like someone out there trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>entertain people and he's getting </v>

930
00:38:58.811 --> 00:39:03.811
<v Speaker 3>attacked by the manner in which he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>entertaining is unsuitable for this </v>

931
00:39:03.811 --> 00:39:07.480
<v Speaker 3>particular type of transmission and </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of that,</v>

932
00:39:07.481 --> 00:39:12.481
<v Speaker 3>the federal government steps in and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>so crazy that anybody would think that </v>

933
00:39:12.481 --> 00:39:17.230
<v Speaker 3>that's a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's allowed to get to be actual law and</v>

934
00:39:17.231 --> 00:39:20.230
<v Speaker 3>still reinforced and in this day and </v>
<v Speaker 3>age,</v>

935
00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:22.900
<v Speaker 3>what people like Tim Winter in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking a PTC,</v>

936
00:39:22.901 --> 00:39:25.570
<v Speaker 3>the parents television council,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they write most of the complaints.</v>

937
00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:30.750
<v Speaker 3>They're the ones who do all the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>complaints and the stupid fcc still </v>

938
00:39:30.750 --> 00:39:31.510
<v Speaker 3>actually takes them seriously and </v>
<v Speaker 3>listens to them.</v>

939
00:39:31.690 --> 00:39:36.690
<v Speaker 3>It's enraging.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like when the Italian American </v>

940
00:39:36.690 --> 00:39:37.420
<v Speaker 3>society or whatever the fuck it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was getting angry at the surprise.</v>

941
00:39:37.690 --> 00:39:42.690
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like just there's certain things </v>

942
00:39:42.690 --> 00:39:44.350
<v Speaker 3>where political correctness become such </v>
<v Speaker 3>a fucking hamper.</v>

943
00:39:44.351 --> 00:39:47.200
<v Speaker 3>Two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a real dialogue to real conversations to</v>

944
00:39:47.201 --> 00:39:50.230
<v Speaker 3>anyone who thinks that he's being pc as </v>
<v Speaker 3>is appropriate is a dope.</v>

945
00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:52.960
<v Speaker 3>Anyone who subscribes that thinking is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>dumb motherfucker.</v>

946
00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:58.000
<v Speaker 3>What you're saying that you don't think </v>
<v Speaker 3>that people like Tony Soprano of every </v>

947
00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.140
<v Speaker 3>existed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you pay attention to history?</v>

948
00:39:59.290 --> 00:40:01.150
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where are you getting this from?</v>

949
00:40:01.151 --> 00:40:04.660
<v Speaker 3>Stupid lucky you're going to protest the</v>
<v Speaker 3>way they're being depicted,</v>

950
00:40:04.661 --> 00:40:09.661
<v Speaker 3>being depicted the way they really are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's plenty of people like that that </v>

951
00:40:09.661 --> 00:40:13.321
<v Speaker 3>are real people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just doesn't mean that that's all </v>

952
00:40:13.321 --> 00:40:13.990
<v Speaker 3>Italian 20 you only protecting retards.</v>

953
00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:16.270
<v Speaker 3>The only protect them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dopiest amongst us,</v>

954
00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:17.770
<v Speaker 3>amongst us that would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

955
00:40:17.771 --> 00:40:21.280
<v Speaker 3>look at all Italians as if they were all</v>
<v Speaker 3>gangsters.</v>

956
00:40:21.281 --> 00:40:26.281
<v Speaker 3>Now because of the Sopranos and why has </v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody ever objected to a positive </v>

957
00:40:26.281 --> 00:40:29.911
<v Speaker 3>profile?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is why they're thinking is flawed </v>

958
00:40:29.911 --> 00:40:30.700
<v Speaker 3>because they're saying the profiling is </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong and generalizing is wrong,</v>

959
00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:33.850
<v Speaker 3>but they never mind when they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>generalized positively,</v>

960
00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:39.030
<v Speaker 3>they nevermind a positive profile or a </v>
<v Speaker 3>pleasant sweeping generalization,</v>

961
00:40:39.150 --> 00:40:42.400
<v Speaker 3>so that's why they're fucking phony.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just don't like a negative thing.</v>

962
00:40:42.410 --> 00:40:44.710
<v Speaker 3>So there's certain things they want you </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be able to say about them and certain</v>

963
00:40:44.711 --> 00:40:49.711
<v Speaker 3>things they don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can talk all day about black guys </v>

964
00:40:49.711 --> 00:40:52.291
<v Speaker 3>and they're big dicks and I do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can't talk about them like one </v>

965
00:40:52.291 --> 00:40:52.760
<v Speaker 3>fried chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

966
00:40:52.761 --> 00:40:54.580
<v Speaker 3>That's negative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And which is hilarious.</v>

967
00:40:54.930 --> 00:40:56.500
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We talked about this yesterday.</v>

968
00:40:56.530 --> 00:40:58.810
<v Speaker 3>Chicken has got damn delicious and </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking wonderful.</v>

969
00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:00.910
<v Speaker 3>What's wrong with being someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 3>into chicken?</v>

970
00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:01.930
<v Speaker 3>I guess maybe they just try.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>

971
00:41:01.931 --> 00:41:06.931
<v Speaker 3>You know what made me black people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>smart and they just trying to refocus </v>

972
00:41:06.931 --> 00:41:06.931
<v Speaker 3>everybody back on the COC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they want all.</v>

973
00:41:06.931 --> 00:41:10.080
<v Speaker 3>They want all stereotypes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fried Chicken and watermelon back.</v>

974
00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:15.640
<v Speaker 3>That's probably a very calculated move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chess move.</v>

975
00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:17.660
<v Speaker 3>It's checked me from the get go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

976
00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:20.590
<v Speaker 3>You can't talk about their strawberry </v>
<v Speaker 3>Soda Bitch.</v>

977
00:41:20.591 --> 00:41:21.720
<v Speaker 3>You Racist?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

978
00:41:21.721 --> 00:41:22.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck functions.</v>

979
00:41:22.631 --> 00:41:23.470
<v Speaker 3>We don't enjoy them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

980
00:41:23.471 --> 00:41:26.020
<v Speaker 3>what else is left?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I heard you have a huge dick word.</v>

981
00:41:26.770 --> 00:41:28.210
<v Speaker 3>Word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

982

<v Speaker 5>which is true,</v>

985
00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:41.330
<v Speaker 5>which is a little bit of that too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's a piece of shit.</v>

986
00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:46.440

<v Speaker 5>with a fucking duffle bag of porn tapes </v>

987
00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:46.690
<v Speaker 5>because I guess he's ocd.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They want to throw him out.</v>

988
00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:48.320
<v Speaker 5>He's like hair,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you had to pass.</v>

989
00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:51.470
<v Speaker 5>He couldn't bring himself to throw it </v>
<v Speaker 5>out the fuck back.</v>

<v Speaker 5>He needs to be roommates with Yoshi than</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yoshi.</v>

993
00:42:02.711 --> 00:42:02.711

<v Speaker 5>but I just couldn't keep medical.</v>

<v Speaker 5>like pulling.</v>

<v Speaker 5>show is that when John Holmes was on,</v>

1009

<v Speaker 5>his Dick isn't even that big for 21st </v>

<v Speaker 5>size of John Holmes.</v>

1013
00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:52.800
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of guys who are getting </v>

1014
00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:52.800
<v Speaker 5>bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1015
00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:54.530
<v Speaker 5>You think it's our cell phones keeping </v>
<v Speaker 5>your pocket?</v>

<v Speaker 5>with pagers.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 5>natural selection.</v>

<v Speaker 5>halfhearted.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Squeeze it at the base.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Lexington both hands in the air.</v>

1032

1090
00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:46.500
<v Speaker 5>Last night we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1091
00:45:46.510 --> 00:45:48.660
<v Speaker 5>entered on a podcast I did with the bone</v>
<v Speaker 5>zone.</v>

1092
00:45:48.661 --> 00:45:53.661
<v Speaker 5>We interviewed one of the girls,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really skyped her while she was in the </v>

1093
00:45:53.661 --> 00:45:55.090
<v Speaker 5>room and talk to her.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

1094
00:45:55.260 --> 00:46:00.260
<v Speaker 5>so that was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the thing we're going to start </v>

1095
00:46:00.260 --> 00:46:01.731
<v Speaker 5>doing now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>More Death Squad is actually talking to </v>

1096
00:46:01.731 --> 00:46:01.731
<v Speaker 5>these girls.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's something about that website.</v>

1097
00:46:01.731 --> 00:46:05.910
<v Speaker 5>My Free Cams when you first showed me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it really kind of freaked me out because</v>

1098
00:46:06.270 --> 00:46:09.930
<v Speaker 5>I really had this impression of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>future.</v>

1099
00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:15.230
<v Speaker 5>I really had this idea of what this is </v>
<v Speaker 5>really going to be because you click on </v>

1100
00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:18.480
<v Speaker 5>this thing and it opens up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It looks like infinite windows.</v>

1101
00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:19.530
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where are these?</v>

1102
00:46:19.531 --> 00:46:22.560
<v Speaker 5>Like these little universes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like what is this?</v>

1103
00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:27.800
<v Speaker 5>And each one of them you click on and </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a different girl connected to the </v>

1104
00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:30.180
<v Speaker 5>Internet doing these little shows and </v>
<v Speaker 5>there's fucking hundreds of them.</v>

1105
00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:31.620
<v Speaker 5>And you're looking at this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

1106
00:46:31.621 --> 00:46:35.250
<v Speaker 5>this is kind of nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What a weird interface this is.</v>

1107
00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:39.750
<v Speaker 5>All these chicks are facing high </v>
<v Speaker 5>themselves and Dildos and,</v>

1108
00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:40.650
<v Speaker 5>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1109
00:46:40.651 --> 00:46:42.840
<v Speaker 5>you can give them money and tune in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

1110
00:46:42.841 --> 00:46:45.270
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1111
00:46:45.271 --> 00:46:46.210
<v Speaker 5>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

1112
00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:48.600
<v Speaker 5>it's a great advancement,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but what's going to happen is eventually</v>

1113
00:46:48.601 --> 00:46:53.601
<v Speaker 5>privacy will be a thing of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I'm not even saying that's a bad </v>

1114
00:46:53.601 --> 00:46:55.560
<v Speaker 5>thing because we're all going to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>locked in on the same mentality.</v>

1115
00:46:55.561 --> 00:46:57.880
<v Speaker 5>We're all going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I'm not even saying it's going to be</v>

1116
00:46:57.881 --> 00:47:02.881
<v Speaker 5>a terrible thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're all going to be on the same wave </v>

1117
00:47:02.881 --> 00:47:03.120
<v Speaker 5>length mentally.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Eventually the Internet's a great start,</v>

1118
00:47:03.121 --> 00:47:08.121
<v Speaker 5>but fast forward 100 years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're gonna be punished for bad </v>

1119
00:47:08.121 --> 00:47:08.310
<v Speaker 5>thoughts as opposed to bad speech or bad</v>
<v Speaker 5>actions.</v>

1120
00:47:08.311 --> 00:47:13.311
<v Speaker 5>People gonna know when you think </v>
<v Speaker 5>something because we're already working </v>

1121
00:47:13.311 --> 00:47:15.321
<v Speaker 5>on that which Stephen Hawkings,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so we're all going to see each other </v>

1122
00:47:15.321 --> 00:47:15.321
<v Speaker 5>sexually.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're all going to know everything about</v>

1123
00:47:15.321 --> 00:47:17.700
<v Speaker 5>each other and eventually it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>lose its effect.</v>

1124
00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:22.880
<v Speaker 5>The dopamine drip won't work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're going to figure out a better way </v>

1125
00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:25.311
<v Speaker 5>to get people feel.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know that feeling you get when </v>

1126
00:47:25.311 --> 00:47:26.991
<v Speaker 5>you're fucking crank into your edging.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're going to find out better ways to </v>

1127
00:47:26.991 --> 00:47:26.991
<v Speaker 5>give people that so the sexual loses its</v>
<v Speaker 5>appeal.</v>

1128
00:47:26.991 --> 00:47:31.940
<v Speaker 5>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This we're in a great time right now if </v>

1129
00:47:31.940 --> 00:47:31.940
<v Speaker 5>a pervert because this</v>

1130
00:47:31.940 --> 00:47:32.410
<v Speaker 3>will eventually go away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to get worse,</v>

1131
00:47:33.060 --> 00:47:36.970
<v Speaker 3>but how has that been true when there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>so much porn online?</v>

1132
00:47:36.971 --> 00:47:40.320
<v Speaker 3>Is that ever going to go with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you think that's going to go with</v>

1133
00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:41.080
<v Speaker 3>porn?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do for you?</v>

1134
00:47:41.230 --> 00:47:42.790
<v Speaker 3>Porn makes us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It turns us on.</v>

1135
00:47:42.791 --> 00:47:47.791
<v Speaker 3>It's all these opportunities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It releases something in the brain when </v>

1136
00:47:47.791 --> 00:47:51.781
<v Speaker 3>eventually they figure out get that in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>pill or even through an electrical </v>

1137
00:47:51.781 --> 00:47:54.420
<v Speaker 3>impulse or a panel that you won't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Corn Patch,</v>

1138
00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:59.700
<v Speaker 3>get a porn past badge and you'd go and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd get a patch and you don't want to </v>

1139
00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:00.230
<v Speaker 3>come anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1140
00:48:00.231 --> 00:48:05.231
<v Speaker 3>nobody would take that option,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you might though because it would </v>

1141
00:48:05.231 --> 00:48:05.370
<v Speaker 3>keep you from cheating on your wife.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It will keep you from getting aids.</v>

1142
00:48:05.371 --> 00:48:08.200
<v Speaker 3>That would keep you from knocking </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody up like the benefits for it.</v>

1143
00:48:08.201 --> 00:48:09.400
<v Speaker 3>Let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I could take one of those,</v>

1144
00:48:09.401 --> 00:48:14.401
<v Speaker 3>the amount of hours I sleep better when </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm jerking off course or if you don't </v>

1145
00:48:14.401 --> 00:48:17.750
<v Speaker 3>have keeps me up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a lot of people that feel </v>

1146
00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:17.770
<v Speaker 3>like life connects them to them.</v>

1147
00:48:17.770 --> 00:48:21.640
<v Speaker 3>Being direct or them being aroused or </v>
<v Speaker 3>them being,</v>

1148
00:48:21.641 --> 00:48:23.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in having sex with someone,</v>

1149
00:48:24.250 --> 00:48:29.250
<v Speaker 3>they feel like they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not alive unless that's </v>

1150
00:48:29.250 --> 00:48:29.250
<v Speaker 3>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you cut,</v>

1151
00:48:29.250 --> 00:48:30.880
<v Speaker 3>if you took a pill that would like do </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1152
00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:33.580
<v Speaker 3>would it stop your ability to do it </v>
<v Speaker 3>naturally?</v>

1153
00:48:33.581 --> 00:48:35.160
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't be able to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What'd you just.</v>

1154
00:48:35.290 --> 00:48:38.050
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't want to have sex anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just want the pill.</v>

1155
00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:43.080
<v Speaker 3>You still want sex,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it would take away the drug </v>

1156
00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:43.080
<v Speaker 3>part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eventually we're going to find a way to.</v>

1157
00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:46.210
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like with the same thing as </v>
<v Speaker 3>with alcohol and drugs and overeating.</v>

1158
00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:49.480
<v Speaker 3>All of that will eventually be fixed </v>
<v Speaker 3>because whatever the brain is doing that</v>

1159
00:48:49.481 --> 00:48:54.481
<v Speaker 3>makes you high or makes you feel great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll figure out a way to make </v>

1160
00:48:54.481 --> 00:48:57.780
<v Speaker 3>everybody feel like that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People won't even need to go out and </v>

1161
00:48:57.780 --> 00:49:01.801
<v Speaker 3>look for that because we'll all be able </v>
<v Speaker 3>to access that feeling whenever we want </v>

1162
00:49:01.801 --> 00:49:01.801
<v Speaker 3>in the next.</v>

1163
00:49:01.801 --> 00:49:02.620
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Quote unquote acceptable way.</v>

1164
00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:07.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're in a weird period right now when </v>

1165
00:49:07.710 --> 00:49:09.601
<v Speaker 3>it comes to things that they give people</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they have mental illnesses or what </v>

1166
00:49:09.601 --> 00:49:14.101
<v Speaker 3>they perceive to be mental illnesses or </v>
<v Speaker 3>depression because I have friends that </v>

1167
00:49:14.101 --> 00:49:17.881
<v Speaker 3>have taken all sorts of different stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm like well how does the doctor </v>

1168
00:49:17.881 --> 00:49:18.370
<v Speaker 3>know what to give you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>

1169
00:49:18.371 --> 00:49:23.371
<v Speaker 3>well they start you on one thing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll see how you react to that and you </v>

1170
00:49:23.371 --> 00:49:28.071
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you go to the doctor and say well I </v>

1171
00:49:28.071 --> 00:49:28.090
<v Speaker 3>can't get it up anymore and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm really listless throughout the day.</v>

1172
00:49:28.091 --> 00:49:33.091
<v Speaker 3>And then they try something else and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they keep switching medications until </v>

1173
00:49:33.091 --> 00:49:33.091
<v Speaker 3>they find one that works for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1174
00:49:33.390 --> 00:49:34.780
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

1175
00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:36.850
<v Speaker 3>Like how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how crazy is that?</v>

1176
00:49:36.851 --> 00:49:41.851
<v Speaker 3>Like they've got a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of different medications and </v>

1177
00:49:41.851 --> 00:49:42.130
<v Speaker 3>they just try them out on you nice and </v>
<v Speaker 3>slow.</v>

1178
00:49:42.130 --> 00:49:47.130
<v Speaker 3>Like how much do they vary and how do </v>
<v Speaker 3>you not you sure you got it nailed with </v>

1179
00:49:47.130 --> 00:49:49.120
<v Speaker 3>this one and what do we take in here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's going on?</v>

1180
00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:51.670
<v Speaker 3>I'm up in the air and that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it does work for some people for</v>

1181
00:49:51.671 --> 00:49:53.140
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't have thought of taking it,</v>

1182
00:49:53.141 --> 00:49:56.080
<v Speaker 3>but I'm afraid of my creativity being </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked with because I probably depressed</v>

1183
00:49:56.081 --> 00:49:57.550
<v Speaker 3>all the time and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's stupid.</v>

1184
00:49:57.551 --> 00:50:02.551
<v Speaker 3>I think I'd rather not be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if I can take a pill to kind of </v>

1185
00:50:02.551 --> 00:50:02.551
<v Speaker 3>balanced out whatever is wrong in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>stupid brain.</v>

1186
00:50:02.590 --> 00:50:04.410
<v Speaker 3>Do you think um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is a,</v>

1187
00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:09.420
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a pattern thing or do you think </v>

1188
00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:11.941
<v Speaker 3>it's a chemical thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when you feel like you're </v>

1189
00:50:11.941 --> 00:50:11.941
<v Speaker 3>depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do,</v>

1190
00:50:11.941 --> 00:50:15.211
<v Speaker 3>you connect it to a certain pattern of </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking that become self destructive </v>

1191
00:50:15.211 --> 00:50:17.350
<v Speaker 3>and you're just real comfortable going </v>
<v Speaker 3>down this pattern?</v>

1192
00:50:17.530 --> 00:50:20.470
<v Speaker 3>Or do you connect it to a actual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you feel like man,</v>

1193
00:50:20.471 --> 00:50:22.810
<v Speaker 3>there's something wrong with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>chemicals my brain is making?</v>

1194
00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:25.900
<v Speaker 3>Or are they even indecipherable?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are they the same thing?</v>

1195
00:50:25.901 --> 00:50:27.560
<v Speaker 3>Do they create each other?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

1196
00:50:27.561 --> 00:50:30.890
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a little bit of everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I think it could be a chemical,</v>

1197
00:50:30.891 --> 00:50:33.260
<v Speaker 3>but the chemical combined with just </v>
<v Speaker 3>shitty thinking.</v>

1198
00:50:33.261 --> 00:50:36.800
<v Speaker 3>It's comfortable thinking you get used </v>
<v Speaker 3>to like whenever things are good for me,</v>

1199
00:50:37.010 --> 00:50:39.200
<v Speaker 3>I start to think like horribly </v>
<v Speaker 3>depressing thoughts.</v>

1200
00:50:39.201 --> 00:50:44.201
<v Speaker 3>Like I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I deserve it or whatever </v>

1201
00:50:44.201 --> 00:50:44.201
<v Speaker 3>that nonsense is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's a combination,</v>

1202
00:50:44.201 --> 00:50:48.430
<v Speaker 3>but I know chemical is a part of it </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I feel it like I don't sleep </v>

1203
00:50:48.430 --> 00:50:52.031
<v Speaker 3>well and I just feel fucking like thick </v>
<v Speaker 3>and sludgy and fogged all the time and I</v>

1204
00:50:52.821 --> 00:50:55.520
<v Speaker 3>fucking hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guarantee you that's the sleep apnea.</v>

1205
00:50:56.220 --> 00:51:01.220
<v Speaker 3>We were talking about this and I told </v>
<v Speaker 3>you that your mouthpiece wasn't the one </v>

1206
00:51:01.671 --> 00:51:04.380
<v Speaker 3>that I use.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I use this one by this guy named Ian.</v>

1207
00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:09.460
<v Speaker 3>Dr Crowe pen from Tarzana and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>developed a mouthpiece that it has </v>

1208
00:51:09.460 --> 00:51:12.830
<v Speaker 3>almost like a finger that keeps your </v>
<v Speaker 3>tongue from falling back over,</v>

1209
00:51:12.831 --> 00:51:13.250
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

1210
00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:15.290
<v Speaker 3>your wind hole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where.</v>

1211
00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:20.340
<v Speaker 3>What were you getting?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No sleep apnea is your fucking fat </v>

1212
00:51:20.340 --> 00:51:23.141
<v Speaker 3>tongue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Likewe collapses while you're lying on </v>

1213
00:51:23.141 --> 00:51:23.680
<v Speaker 3>your back and literally covers your air </v>
<v Speaker 3>hole.</v>

1214
00:51:23.890 --> 00:51:28.890
<v Speaker 3>It's just a shitty design in the human </v>
<v Speaker 3>face and some of us have it and some </v>

1215
00:51:28.890 --> 00:51:31.400
<v Speaker 3>people don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well you have obstructive.</v>

1216
00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:36.430
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know if I have obstructive </v>
<v Speaker 3>or a combination of obstructive and </v>

1217
00:51:36.430 --> 00:51:36.800
<v Speaker 3>central where central is when your brain</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't send the signal.</v>

1218
00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:38.720
<v Speaker 3>Like I think that's what it's called.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when I've,</v>

1219
00:51:38.750 --> 00:51:40.730
<v Speaker 3>because I've woken up at times and just </v>
<v Speaker 3>got.</v>

1220
00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:45.760
<v Speaker 3>You haven't breathed like breathing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not like not I'm trying to </v>

1221
00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:49.301
<v Speaker 3>breathe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I have not attempted a breath and I </v>

1222
00:51:49.301 --> 00:51:51.210
<v Speaker 3>know I'll miss a couple of cycles and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>wake up panicking and uh,</v>

1223
00:51:51.211 --> 00:51:56.211
<v Speaker 3>I think I might have part of that too </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the mouthpiece I have I sleep a </v>

1224
00:51:56.211 --> 00:51:56.211
<v Speaker 3>little better with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does help.</v>

1225
00:51:56.570 --> 00:51:58.640
<v Speaker 3>But I don't know if it's totally an </v>
<v Speaker 3>obstructive apnea thing.</v>

1226
00:51:58.820 --> 00:52:03.650
<v Speaker 3>I actually woke the guy up on the plane </v>
<v Speaker 3>coming back from Brazil.</v>

1227
00:52:04.130 --> 00:52:04.810
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1228
00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:09.020
<v Speaker 3>I remember just being horrible Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember like being on a plane next to</v>

1229
00:52:09.021 --> 00:52:10.400
<v Speaker 3>you and just being like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>

1230
00:52:10.401 --> 00:52:13.220
<v Speaker 3>That's not normal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But now even like it was that bad.</v>

1231
00:52:13.221 --> 00:52:14.010
<v Speaker 3>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

1232
00:52:14.110 --> 00:52:16.190
<v Speaker 3>I snored real bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>real bad.</v>

1233
00:52:16.191 --> 00:52:19.970
<v Speaker 3>But what I'm saying is I saw a guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>having sleep apnea and I,</v>

1234
00:52:19.971 --> 00:52:20.750
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was hidden.</v>

1235
00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:24.230
<v Speaker 3>He was a big guy and so I went to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>flight attendant and I'm like,</v>

1236
00:52:24.231 --> 00:52:27.650
<v Speaker 3>this guy goes for like these stretches </v>
<v Speaker 3>where he's not breathing,</v>

1237
00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:29.570
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it was a long stretch.</v>

1238
00:52:29.571 --> 00:52:34.571
<v Speaker 3>There were like 20,</v>
<v Speaker 3>25 seconds with no breathing and he see </v>

1239
00:52:34.571 --> 00:52:34.610
<v Speaker 3>him struggle and struggle and then.</v>

1240
00:52:39.050 --> 00:52:41.690
<v Speaker 3>And then he would close it up again and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1241
00:52:41.691 --> 00:52:43.190
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy is going to die.</v>

1242
00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:46.850
<v Speaker 3>Like you can't keep doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's real bad sleep apnea.</v>

1243
00:52:46.851 --> 00:52:51.851
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know what it looked like to </v>
<v Speaker 3>watch someone like choke and gasp for </v>

1244
00:52:51.851 --> 00:52:55.010
<v Speaker 3>air and then then like his chest wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>moving.</v>

1245
00:52:55.390 --> 00:52:56.480
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what?</v>

1246
00:52:56.481 --> 00:53:01.481
<v Speaker 3>Little wiggles with his chest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no breathing and then all sudden </v>

1247
00:53:01.481 --> 00:53:04.460
<v Speaker 3>look like big swallowing and gasping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this guy's getting no sleep.</v>

1248
00:53:04.461 --> 00:53:07.550
<v Speaker 3>If he sleeps like this every night he </v>
<v Speaker 3>gets no fucking sleep.</v>

1249
00:53:07.910 --> 00:53:08.510
<v Speaker 3>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

1250
00:53:08.511 --> 00:53:10.300
<v Speaker 3>you can get a heart attack from this for</v>
<v Speaker 3>real.</v>

1251
00:53:10.301 --> 00:53:15.301
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need to do something about this </v>

1252
00:53:15.301 --> 00:53:15.301
<v Speaker 3>Llama Basil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard for me to fall asleep.</v>

1253
00:53:15.301 --> 00:53:19.270
<v Speaker 3>It's not anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard for me to stay asleep like </v>

1254
00:53:19.270 --> 00:53:19.270
<v Speaker 3>I've had to get up and paid because </v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

1255
00:53:19.270 --> 00:53:22.040
<v Speaker 3>I've had had to go to the bathroom and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then somebody said that that's sometimes</v>

1256
00:53:22.041 --> 00:53:27.041
<v Speaker 3>your mind wakes you up thinking that </v>
<v Speaker 3>like you're not going to breathe so it </v>

1257
00:53:27.041 --> 00:53:27.720
<v Speaker 3>wakes you up to piss because that will </v>
<v Speaker 3>get you up.</v>

1258
00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:29.760
<v Speaker 3>It's a really weird signalling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your body will send,</v>

1259
00:53:29.761 --> 00:53:30.560
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'll make you feel.</v>

1260
00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:33.570
<v Speaker 3>You have to Piss.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's worried about your control.</v>

1261
00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:38.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which shows you like our priorities are </v>

1262
00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:38.600
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't,</v>

1263
00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:38.600
<v Speaker 3>I can't breathe on my own,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I have to piss all.</v>

1264
00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:39.450
<v Speaker 3>Jump up and I'll take a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see,</v>

1265
00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:43.470
<v Speaker 3>this guy didn't say woke him up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I woke him up.</v>

1266
00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:46.060
<v Speaker 3>He woke up rather when he saw the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1267
00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:51.120
<v Speaker 3>the flight attendant and me like </v>
<v Speaker 3>watching him maybe like sense that we </v>

1268
00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:55.271
<v Speaker 3>were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it wasn't sleeping anyway because </v>

1269
00:53:55.271 --> 00:53:55.271
<v Speaker 3>he was snoring so loud.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

1270
00:53:55.271 --> 00:53:55.540
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1271
00:53:55.620 --> 00:54:00.620
<v Speaker 3>he had no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had no idea when I was told that I </v>

1272
00:54:00.620 --> 00:54:00.620
<v Speaker 3>had sleep apnea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1273
00:54:00.620 --> 00:54:01.450
<v Speaker 3>when I went to way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1274
00:54:01.460 --> 00:54:02.110
<v Speaker 3>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1275
00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:07.220
<v Speaker 3>I knew that I had snored,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when I went to an actual place or </v>

1276
00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:07.500
<v Speaker 3>they monitor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when you go to sleep,</v>

1277
00:54:07.590 --> 00:54:09.300
<v Speaker 3>right to do that with you?</v>

1278
00:54:09.370 --> 00:54:14.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I get to take home and they say I </v>

1279
00:54:14.370 --> 00:54:14.370
<v Speaker 3>definitely had not the worst apnea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the next 100.</v>

1280
00:54:14.370 --> 00:54:17.730
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like what are the worst.</v>

1281
00:54:17.731 --> 00:54:20.430
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't have fallen asleep in a place</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that where you able to fall asleep.</v>

1282
00:54:20.610 --> 00:54:25.610
<v Speaker 3>It was real hard for a different level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're covered with these fucking </v>

1283
00:54:25.610 --> 00:54:25.980
<v Speaker 3>electronics can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was really hard,</v>

1284
00:54:25.981 --> 00:54:28.410
<v Speaker 3>but I was so tired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I made sure that I got.</v>

1285
00:54:28.411 --> 00:54:30.030
<v Speaker 3>I showed up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're really tired.</v>

1286
00:54:30.270 --> 00:54:31.830
<v Speaker 3>But man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just smoked first.</v>

1287
00:54:32.010 --> 00:54:32.750
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1288
00:54:32.790 --> 00:54:33.990
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just went.</v>

1289
00:54:34.050 --> 00:54:34.440
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1290
00:54:34.441 --> 00:54:37.050
<v Speaker 3>Because I don't smoke before I go to </v>
<v Speaker 3>sleep usually.</v>

1291
00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:38.130
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1292
00:54:38.330 --> 00:54:41.520
<v Speaker 3>I spoke before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I write small before I do Jujitsu.</v>

1293
00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:43.350
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that.</v>

1294
00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:44.960
<v Speaker 3>I'm very surprised here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1295
00:54:44.961 --> 00:54:49.961
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the best way to do Jiu Jitsu </v>

1296
00:54:49.961 --> 00:54:49.961
<v Speaker 3>because you're more relaxed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more focused.</v>

1297
00:54:49.961 --> 00:54:51.090
<v Speaker 3>They know this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

1298
00:54:51.091 --> 00:54:55.170
<v Speaker 3>the type of pot that I smoke is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's two types of two different types</v>

1299
00:54:55.171 --> 00:54:55.590
<v Speaker 3>of pot.</v>

1300
00:54:55.660 --> 00:55:00.660
<v Speaker 3>One is called Endeca and one's called </v>
<v Speaker 3>Sativa and Indica is the stuff that </v>

1301
00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:02.490
<v Speaker 3>people get that makes you like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like a narcotic.</v>

1302
00:55:02.550 --> 00:55:04.710
<v Speaker 3>It's like you could collapse into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>couch.</v>

1303
00:55:04.711 --> 00:55:08.140
<v Speaker 3>It's just like more of like a sedative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more of like a,</v>

1304
00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:11.190
<v Speaker 3>it makes you kind of feel like just at </v>
<v Speaker 3>ease,</v>

1305
00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:15.000
<v Speaker 3>chill and relaxed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's great for like pain.</v>

1306
00:55:15.001 --> 00:55:19.410
<v Speaker 3>It's great for sex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But Sativa is the stuff that I liked and</v>

1307
00:55:19.411 --> 00:55:22.550
<v Speaker 3>that's more speedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's more um,</v>

1308
00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:24.060
<v Speaker 3>sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1309
00:55:24.150 --> 00:55:26.860
<v Speaker 3>it feels like it accelerates your </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking and makes you,</v>

1310
00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:31.140
<v Speaker 3>it makes you think about crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the best thing for me is sativa and</v>

1311
00:55:31.141 --> 00:55:33.340
<v Speaker 3>like a Carl Sagan documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1312
00:55:33.620 --> 00:55:35.100
<v Speaker 3>you just go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>

1313
00:55:35.101 --> 00:55:40.101
<v Speaker 3>And you listened to the Carl Sagan </v>
<v Speaker 3>explaining the universe and it's just </v>

1314
00:55:40.561 --> 00:55:41.490
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1315
00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:43.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the perfect pot for thinking.</v>

1316
00:55:43.650 --> 00:55:48.650
<v Speaker 3>He wrote a community,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a communion with communion and I was </v>

1317
00:55:48.650 --> 00:55:48.650
<v Speaker 3>contacted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jodie foster.</v>

1318
00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:49.980
<v Speaker 3>He wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1319
00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:52.050
<v Speaker 3>that was a great fucking moving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was,</v>

1320
00:55:52.051 --> 00:55:53.400
<v Speaker 3>to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>still holds up,</v>

1321
00:55:53.470 --> 00:55:58.470
<v Speaker 3>watched it the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of those things where you're </v>

1322
00:55:58.470 --> 00:55:58.470
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

1323
00:55:58.470 --> 00:56:00.741
<v Speaker 3>that's probably how it would actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen when she's going through and the </v>

1324
00:56:00.741 --> 00:56:00.780
<v Speaker 3>fucking warm haul.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It all kind of feels right.</v>

1325
00:56:00.781 --> 00:56:04.650
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't feel cheesy or Hokey at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's look system.</v>

1326
00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:06.960
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were talking about this yesterday.</v>

1327
00:56:06.961 --> 00:56:09.370
<v Speaker 3>I had the guy from ancient aliens on and</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1328
00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:10.430
<v Speaker 3>we were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1329
00:56:10.450 --> 00:56:13.740
<v Speaker 3>the possibilities of a Ufo was like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1330
00:56:13.770 --> 00:56:18.770
<v Speaker 3>like what the they had in contact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't seem outside the realm of </v>

1331
00:56:18.770 --> 00:56:21.270
<v Speaker 3>what we're capable of and 30 years or 50</v>
<v Speaker 3>years or 100 years.</v>

1332
00:56:21.290 --> 00:56:23.010
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you asked me could we come up?</v>

1333
00:56:23.110 --> 00:56:24.250
<v Speaker 3>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we lived</v>

1334
00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:25.540
<v Speaker 1>a thousand years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

1335
00:56:25.570 --> 00:56:26.500
<v Speaker 1>fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course we could.</v>

1336
00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:27.550
<v Speaker 1>You have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I interviewed Bernie,</v>

1337
00:56:27.850 --> 00:56:28.240
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

1338
00:56:28.241 --> 00:56:29.170
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ray Kurzwell.</v>

1339
00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:30.160
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1340
00:56:31.080 --> 00:56:33.490
<v Speaker 1>We had them on want and he's kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dry guy,</v>

1341
00:56:33.491 --> 00:56:38.491
<v Speaker 1>but he's a real genius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he talks about how technology is </v>

1342
00:56:38.491 --> 00:56:41.101
<v Speaker 1>advancing exponentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we're doubling our knowledge and </v>

1343
00:56:41.101 --> 00:56:43.501
<v Speaker 1>doubling and doubling or knowledge and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he thinks there's going be a point of </v>

1344
00:56:43.501 --> 00:56:46.021
<v Speaker 1>singularity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we just know everything as it </v>

1345
00:56:46.021 --> 00:56:48.571
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where are we will catch up because the </v>

1346
00:56:48.571 --> 00:56:48.571
<v Speaker 1>way technology age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our brain,</v>

1347
00:56:48.571 --> 00:56:49.750
<v Speaker 1>like once we can incorporate something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like Google,</v>

1348
00:56:49.910 --> 00:56:51.160
<v Speaker 1>you'll just think of something and know </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1349
00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:52.630
<v Speaker 1>You won't need to Google it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll.</v>

1350
00:56:52.980 --> 00:56:57.980
<v Speaker 1>He was a genius and I think his time </v>
<v Speaker 1>frame is off because he thinks that in </v>

1351
00:56:57.980 --> 00:57:01.951
<v Speaker 1>40 years we're going to have singularity</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think he thinks that because he </v>

1352
00:57:01.951 --> 00:57:04.801
<v Speaker 1>wants to stay alive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he talks about immortality and </v>

1353
00:57:04.801 --> 00:57:04.801
<v Speaker 1>uploading.</v>

1354
00:57:04.801 --> 00:57:07.950
<v Speaker 1>Once we understand how the electrical </v>
<v Speaker 1>impulses can be uploaded to a hard </v>

1355
00:57:07.950 --> 00:57:07.950
<v Speaker 1>drive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a fascinating guy.</v>

1356
00:57:07.950 --> 00:57:09.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've read a bunch of stuff.</v>

1357
00:57:09.190 --> 00:57:09.670
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have?</v>

1358
00:57:09.671 --> 00:57:10.420
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm explaining to them,</v>

1359
00:57:10.421 --> 00:57:11.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd love that document.</v>

1360
00:57:11.921 --> 00:57:14.380
<v Speaker 1>It's good to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For people to hear that documentary,</v>

1361
00:57:14.410 --> 00:57:15.820
<v Speaker 1>the transcendent man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1362
00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:18.190
<v Speaker 1>That's a fucking amazing documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>

1363
00:57:18.220 --> 00:57:23.220
<v Speaker 1>really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was really interesting to see the </v>

1364
00:57:23.220 --> 00:57:26.490
<v Speaker 1>different points of view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people who are really optimistic </v>

1365
00:57:26.490 --> 00:57:29.791
<v Speaker 1>about intelligence that is artificially </v>
<v Speaker 1>created and people who are terrified of </v>

1366
00:57:29.791 --> 00:57:30.580
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some of those guys that were like,</v>

1367
00:57:30.581 --> 00:57:32.260
<v Speaker 1>you don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if this happens,</v>

1368
00:57:32.380 --> 00:57:37.380
<v Speaker 1>like the one guy that was calling it an </v>
<v Speaker 1>artilect who was the English guy who's </v>

1369
00:57:37.380 --> 00:57:37.600
<v Speaker 1>talked about our telex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1370
00:57:37.601 --> 00:57:38.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I saw this special.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've just.</v>

1371
00:57:38.831 --> 00:57:40.840
<v Speaker 1>I've just read some of the stuff that </v>
<v Speaker 1>will.</v>

1372
00:57:40.841 --> 00:57:45.841
<v Speaker 1>They had a bunch of different people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are experts on this idea of </v>

1373
00:57:45.841 --> 00:57:49.060
<v Speaker 1>artificial intelligence becoming </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentient and one of them was like,</v>

1374
00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:50.860
<v Speaker 1>fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to get wiped out.</v>

1375
00:57:51.070 --> 00:57:56.070
<v Speaker 1>One of them was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy's like all terminator doom and </v>

1376
00:57:56.070 --> 00:57:58.651
<v Speaker 1>gloom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we don't even know what's going to </v>

1377
00:57:58.651 --> 00:58:00.541
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And with the real worry is that if they </v>

1378
00:58:00.541 --> 00:58:03.151
<v Speaker 1>fuck around and like program emotions </v>
<v Speaker 1>and jealousy and rage into a computer </v>

1379
00:58:03.151 --> 00:58:07.950
<v Speaker 1>thinking that they have to do this in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order to really truly replicate a human </v>

1380
00:58:07.950 --> 00:58:10.660
<v Speaker 1>being instead of replicating someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely creepy with no emotions.</v>

1381
00:58:10.870 --> 00:58:15.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're going to make an artificial </v>

1382
00:58:15.870 --> 00:58:17.191
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't they make an artificial person </v>

1383
00:58:17.191 --> 00:58:17.191
<v Speaker 1>that has human characteristics so it </v>
<v Speaker 1>would blend in.</v>

1384
00:58:17.191 --> 00:58:21.960
<v Speaker 1>So then what if that fucking thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this artificial computer can actually </v>

1385
00:58:21.960 --> 00:58:25.891
<v Speaker 1>make a better artificial computer that a</v>
<v Speaker 1>human can make and then it just </v>

1386
00:58:25.891 --> 00:58:28.360
<v Speaker 1>exponentially increases in like over a </v>
<v Speaker 1>period of like zero time.</v>

1387
00:58:28.630 --> 00:58:32.230
<v Speaker 1>They've created way better human beings </v>
<v Speaker 1>than we could've ever created.</v>

1388
00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:35.290
<v Speaker 1>And that's the singularity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the shit really hits the fan.</v>

1389
00:58:35.340 --> 00:58:40.340
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't surprise me if it happens </v>

1390
00:58:40.340 --> 00:58:40.340
<v Speaker 1>eventually because I mean again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all chemical reactions,</v>

1391
00:58:40.340 --> 00:58:40.340
<v Speaker 1>anger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rage,</v>

1392
00:58:40.340 --> 00:58:41.860
<v Speaker 1>jealousy one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's all unique.</v>

1393
00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:43.630
<v Speaker 1>Could probably break it down to ones and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zeros.</v>

1394
00:58:43.631 --> 00:58:46.270
<v Speaker 1>So once they figured that out in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>computer and they can map our DNA,</v>

1395
00:58:46.271 --> 00:58:47.650
<v Speaker 1>that stuff will definitely be a part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1396
00:58:48.100 --> 00:58:51.220
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be a weird thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to have to discuss.</v>

1397
00:58:51.370 --> 00:58:56.140
<v Speaker 1>Should we create like these crazy fake </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that never get angry.</v>

1398
00:58:56.141 --> 00:58:56.800
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's the future</v>

1399
00:58:56.970 --> 00:58:59.010
<v Speaker 6>Birdie did artificial intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like Siri,</v>

1400
00:58:59.011 --> 00:59:04.011
<v Speaker 6>it's like meeting series,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a girl he met at a coffee shop </v>

1401
00:59:04.011 --> 00:59:06.551
<v Speaker 6>briefly and then in like 10 or 15 years </v>
<v Speaker 6>we're going to actually see her in a </v>

1402
00:59:06.551 --> 00:59:06.551
<v Speaker 6>different form,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1403
00:59:06.551 --> 00:59:10.811
<v Speaker 6>a little older.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then one day we're gonna be fucking </v>

1404
00:59:10.811 --> 00:59:10.811
<v Speaker 6>Siri if you think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She's,</v>

1405
00:59:10.811 --> 00:59:11.960
<v Speaker 6>she's the star of artificial </v>
<v Speaker 6>intelligence.</v>

1406
00:59:11.961 --> 00:59:14.220
<v Speaker 6>I Hate Siri.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I fucking hate it.</v>

1407
00:59:14.310 --> 00:59:17.610
<v Speaker 6>I'd still worst I try to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I try to talk with it and just go back.</v>

1408
00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:18.260
<v Speaker 6>Donk,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Donk,</v>

1409
00:59:18.261 --> 00:59:18.620
<v Speaker 6>donk,</v>
<v Speaker 6>donk,</v>

1410
00:59:18.621 --> 00:59:19.970
<v Speaker 6>donk.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It just fucking mocked me.</v>

1411
00:59:20.090 --> 00:59:21.950
<v Speaker 6>I can never get Siri work.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1412
00:59:21.951 --> 00:59:22.100
<v Speaker 6>I'm</v>

1413
00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:23.010
<v Speaker 5>not a fan of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1414
00:59:23.050 --> 00:59:23.870
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1415
00:59:23.890 --> 00:59:26.300
<v Speaker 5>I forgot about it and I started using it</v>
<v Speaker 5>again and it was like,</v>

1416
00:59:26.330 --> 00:59:27.830
<v Speaker 5>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is totally helpful.</v>

1417
00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:30.920
<v Speaker 5>I liked the call feature can say called </v>
<v Speaker 5>Norton,</v>

1418
00:59:31.130 --> 00:59:33.830
<v Speaker 5>calling north reading text messages when</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're driving.</v>

1419
00:59:33.831 --> 00:59:34.610
<v Speaker 5>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1420
00:59:34.611 --> 00:59:39.611
<v Speaker 5>I don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I Made Sam father listen to me fucking </v>

1421
00:59:39.611 --> 00:59:39.680
<v Speaker 5>dirty talk somebody through Syria.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was afraid to do it,</v>

1422
00:59:39.681 --> 00:59:41.680
<v Speaker 5>so I was driving and dirty talking to </v>
<v Speaker 5>chicken.</v>

1423
00:59:41.690 --> 00:59:43.760
<v Speaker 5>It actually came out pretty good,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was weird.</v>

1424
00:59:43.761 --> 00:59:48.761
<v Speaker 5>They have a guy here that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to correct it because it's </v>

1425
00:59:48.761 --> 00:59:48.761
<v Speaker 5>saying it wrong or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's hilarious.</v>

1426
00:59:48.761 --> 00:59:51.440
<v Speaker 5>Driving dirty,</v>
<v Speaker 5>talking in a text through Siri.</v>

1427
00:59:51.890 --> 00:59:55.010
<v Speaker 5>It seems like that's an extra activity </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the future.</v>

1428
00:59:55.130 --> 00:59:56.570
<v Speaker 5>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a hard drug to break,</v>

1429
00:59:56.571 --> 01:00:01.571
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The fucking the dirty talk to texting </v>

1430
01:00:01.571 --> 01:00:05.261
<v Speaker 5>the fucking that whole keep it going and</v>
<v Speaker 5>have a bunch of those little windows </v>

1431
01:00:05.261 --> 01:00:05.600
<v Speaker 5>open and just go to it and go to it and </v>
<v Speaker 5>go to it.</v>

1432
01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:08.090
<v Speaker 5>It's so hard to fucking break that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really difficult.</v>

1433
01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:10.550
<v Speaker 5>She just enjoy the banter puck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love it.</v>

1434
01:00:10.970 --> 01:00:12.760
<v Speaker 5>I love it more than actually fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>really.</v>

1435
01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:18.100
<v Speaker 5>What is it about just the excitement of </v>
<v Speaker 5>knowing someone's into you and they </v>

1436
01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:20.030
<v Speaker 5>respond to you and it just gets kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>freaky and then you're like,</v>

1437
01:00:20.031 --> 01:00:22.640
<v Speaker 5>how far is this going to go and Holy </v>
<v Speaker 5>Shit.</v>

1438
01:00:22.641 --> 01:00:26.750
<v Speaker 5>Which she went with it and I can't </v>
<v Speaker 5>believe she's going to put it in my ass.</v>

1439
01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:28.600
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

1440
01:00:28.601 --> 01:00:31.140
<v Speaker 5>And her saying that to me in my ass.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1441
01:00:31.190 --> 01:00:31.660
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1442
01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:34.740
<v Speaker 5>no her saying that to you straight me </v>
<v Speaker 5>right now is my Dick,</v>

1443
01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:37.070
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like whoa.</v>

1444
01:00:37.430 --> 01:00:39.770
<v Speaker 5>I liked the idea of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I liked the high of it.</v>

1445
01:00:40.050 --> 01:00:41.840
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it fucking is the end of it.</v>

1446
01:00:41.841 --> 01:00:43.160
<v Speaker 5>It's like going to sleep after you've </v>
<v Speaker 5>been drinking.</v>

1447
01:00:43.210 --> 01:00:47.330
<v Speaker 5>You want to just keep the rush going,</v>
<v Speaker 5>keep the high going and once you fucking</v>

1448
01:00:47.331 --> 01:00:49.100
<v Speaker 5>comments over once you blow your load.</v>

1449
01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:54.220
<v Speaker 5>I've actually had escorts were,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I haven't blown a load because they </v>

1450
01:00:54.220 --> 01:00:54.410
<v Speaker 5>weren't the perfect one and I waited </v>
<v Speaker 5>till later that night.</v>

1451
01:00:54.411 --> 01:00:59.300
<v Speaker 5>Just completed diction man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you had him Roy before Jimmy?</v>

1452
01:00:59.630 --> 01:01:01.550
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got a little bit of a Roy.</v>

1453
01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:03.440
<v Speaker 5>Not too bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1454
01:01:03.470 --> 01:01:08.470
<v Speaker 5>which is a shame because my ex wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck me with the strap on and I would </v>

1455
01:01:08.470 --> 01:01:10.070
<v Speaker 5>have let her,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I will just flow really well without</v>

1456
01:01:10.071 --> 01:01:15.071
<v Speaker 5>a doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you still have a pretty butthole </v>

1457
01:01:15.071 --> 01:01:16.871
<v Speaker 5>then?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you don't have any fucking war </v>

1458
01:01:16.871 --> 01:01:16.871
<v Speaker 5>damage?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1459
01:01:16.871 --> 01:01:16.871
<v Speaker 5>it's nice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's actually not bad at all.</v>

1460
01:01:16.871 --> 01:01:21.110
<v Speaker 5>I really had almost nothing in my ass.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of tongues because it's very </v>

1461
01:01:21.110 --> 01:01:21.370
<v Speaker 5>hairless.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Very rarely has any odor.</v>

1462
01:01:21.371 --> 01:01:23.960
<v Speaker 5>My ass is phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When it comes to that shit with odor,</v>

1463
01:01:24.110 --> 01:01:26.930
<v Speaker 5>I very rarely is it gold bond.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't sweat it.</v>

1464
01:01:26.970 --> 01:01:29.150
<v Speaker 5>How many times have you had a girl use a</v>
<v Speaker 5>strap on on?</v>

1465
01:01:29.150 --> 01:01:30.940
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've had a couple of tribe.</v>

1466
01:01:30.941 --> 01:01:32.780
<v Speaker 5>My ex girlfriend tried,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she was a trooper,</v>

1467
01:01:33.410 --> 01:01:34.820
<v Speaker 5>but I would always go like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ah,</v>

1468
01:01:35.210 --> 01:01:37.920
<v Speaker 5>and I got maybe the helmet and I could </v>
<v Speaker 5>never get more than that.</v>

1469
01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:40.760
<v Speaker 5>I felt like I had to shell when the </v>
<v Speaker 5>girls doing that,</v>

1470
01:01:40.761 --> 01:01:44.380
<v Speaker 5>is she doing it because it turns her on </v>
<v Speaker 5>or she's doing that because like,</v>

1471
01:01:44.450 --> 01:01:46.010
<v Speaker 5>it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what,</v>

1472
01:01:46.030 --> 01:01:51.030
<v Speaker 5>what is she doing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is She just made she sticking something </v>

1473
01:01:51.030 --> 01:01:51.560
<v Speaker 5>inside you that she can't even feel.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But she's feeling the power of it.</v>

1474
01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:56.760
<v Speaker 5>So sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like to somebody like when you </v>

1475
01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:56.760
<v Speaker 5>spank somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it turns you on,</v>

1476
01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:57.770
<v Speaker 5>but it doesn't turn you on because </v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a sensation on your hand.</v>

1477
01:01:57.920 --> 01:01:59.570
<v Speaker 5>It's the fucking sound.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the,</v>

1478
01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:01.280
<v Speaker 5>it's the representation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1479
01:02:01.281 --> 01:02:03.320
<v Speaker 5>you spank a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's all that stuff.</v>

1480
01:02:03.321 --> 01:02:08.321
<v Speaker 5>The domination of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's how I think he feels when she's </v>

1481
01:02:08.321 --> 01:02:08.321
<v Speaker 5>fucking you with a strap on.</v>

1482
01:02:08.321 --> 01:02:08.321
<v Speaker 5>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1483
01:02:08.390 --> 01:02:09.860
<v Speaker 5>and I never actually,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wish I could do it.</v>

1484

1485
01:02:11.481 --> 01:02:13.800

<v Speaker 5>I haven't tried it alone.</v>

1486
01:02:13.850 --> 01:02:18.850
<v Speaker 5>Time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the female version of the bank </v>

1487
01:02:18.850 --> 01:02:18.850
<v Speaker 5>then?</v>

<v Speaker 5>didn't have to fucking back off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wonder,</v>

1502
01:03:02.100 --> 01:03:06.870
<v Speaker 5>is it like maple syrup or what is just </v>
<v Speaker 5>an odd sour fucking.</v>

<v Speaker 5>fucking 12 hour drive or it's the </v>

1504
01:03:12.140 --> 01:03:15.140
<v Speaker 5>fucking that will water or there's </v>
<v Speaker 5>something chemically different about </v>

1505
01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:15.140
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just don't enjoy it.</v>

1506
01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:19.360
<v Speaker 5>Something in their climate or something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe some of the hottest girls on the </v>

1507
01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:19.360
<v Speaker 5>planet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're from Canada.</v>

1508
01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:20.450
<v Speaker 5>They are lovely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>

1509
01:03:20.490 --> 01:03:23.060
<v Speaker 5>I got cockies not too long ago by some </v>
<v Speaker 5>Canadian stripper.</v>

1510
01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:27.360
<v Speaker 5>So do you like you hold a grudge for all</v>
<v Speaker 5>Canadians because this one girl,</v>

1511
01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:30.150
<v Speaker 5>not my role.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anti Canadian Pussy.</v>

1512
01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:31.500
<v Speaker 5>That's been a few girls.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Believe me,</v>

1513
01:03:31.530 --> 01:03:33.150
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I tried the theory.</v>

1514
01:03:33.151 --> 01:03:35.490
<v Speaker 5>I never just go with one bad one because</v>
<v Speaker 5>it could have been period.</v>

1515
01:03:35.491 --> 01:03:37.440
<v Speaker 5>Like I don't like armpits.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If a girl has a period period,</v>

1516
01:03:37.441 --> 01:03:42.441
<v Speaker 5>pitzer fucking humanist girls.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You are an expert in how girls armpits </v>

1517
01:03:42.441 --> 01:03:44.370
<v Speaker 5>smell differently during their period </v>
<v Speaker 5>with girlfriends.</v>

1518
01:03:44.371 --> 01:03:46.170
<v Speaker 5>At least I can tell.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Once you know somebody chemically,</v>

1519
01:03:46.171 --> 01:03:47.330
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can tell by their scent.</v>

1520
01:03:47.340 --> 01:03:50.130
<v Speaker 5>Like we did a contest in Cleveland and I</v>
<v Speaker 5>got most of them right.</v>

1521
01:03:50.430 --> 01:03:52.620
<v Speaker 5>But you can tell if it's an annuity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking smell.</v>

1522
01:03:52.621 --> 01:03:55.110
<v Speaker 5>She's probably on a rag in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Her body's just expelling everything.</v>

1523
01:03:56.470 --> 01:03:59.070
<v Speaker 5>That shit was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just depends on your diet though.</v>

1524
01:03:59.150 --> 01:04:00.180
<v Speaker 5>A part of it does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1525
01:04:00.181 --> 01:04:05.181
<v Speaker 5>But if you have a consistency and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking something about that fucking </v>

1526
01:04:05.181 --> 01:04:05.530
<v Speaker 5>smell it.</v>

1527
01:04:05.820 --> 01:04:10.820
<v Speaker 5>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it can't be that fucking oniony pit </v>

1528
01:04:10.820 --> 01:04:12.951
<v Speaker 5>odor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if you have a good chemistry with </v>

1529
01:04:12.951 --> 01:04:14.811
<v Speaker 5>somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's something about that that makes </v>

1530
01:04:14.811 --> 01:04:14.811
<v Speaker 5>me crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Men.</v>

1531
01:04:14.811 --> 01:04:17.460
<v Speaker 5>And do you like bio or do you like Geo </v>
<v Speaker 5>Obo?</v>

1532
01:04:17.690 --> 01:04:19.470
<v Speaker 5>But it puts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I liked the mouth to be clean.</v>

1533
01:04:19.530 --> 01:04:21.360
<v Speaker 5>I want her mouth the face clean.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1534
01:04:21.361 --> 01:04:23.160
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He just to smell waxy.</v>

1535
01:04:23.161 --> 01:04:24.570
<v Speaker 5>I don't want her belly button.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This stink.</v>

1536
01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:29.040
<v Speaker 5>The feet can smell a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Honest to God.</v>

1537
01:04:29.041 --> 01:04:34.041
<v Speaker 5>I liked that a little bit and a little </v>
<v Speaker 5>bit of a fucking little sweaty and the </v>

1538
01:04:34.441 --> 01:04:36.570
<v Speaker 5>ass can smell a little bit and the pussy</v>
<v Speaker 5>a little bit.</v>

1539
01:04:36.571 --> 01:04:41.370
<v Speaker 5>As long as it's not fucking checklist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I swear to God.</v>

1540
01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:45.610
<v Speaker 5>Deniro face on where you go to this </v>
<v Speaker 5>checklist.</v>

1541
01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:47.310
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>good.</v>

1542
01:04:47.380 --> 01:04:49.380
<v Speaker 5>I had the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>ASCE has a certain level,</v>

1543
01:04:49.381 --> 01:04:52.970
<v Speaker 5>it can go to a little bit of a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>lie yourself a little bit.</v>

1544
01:04:53.350 --> 01:04:58.350
<v Speaker 5>Just a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The as what is the particular smile </v>

1545
01:04:58.350 --> 01:04:58.590
<v Speaker 5>that's acceptable?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is there a level?</v>

1546
01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:00.570
<v Speaker 5>It's like they say about pornography.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what A.</v>

1547
01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:01.860
<v Speaker 5>I can't describe it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know what I see it.</v>

1548
01:05:01.861 --> 01:05:03.630
<v Speaker 5>That's the way it is with an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like I,</v>

1549
01:05:03.631 --> 01:05:06.150
<v Speaker 5>I.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It has a slight asshole smell to it.</v>

1550
01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:08.160
<v Speaker 5>Like a must.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's fun.</v>

1551
01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:12.300
<v Speaker 5>It's nice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is that all law about obscenity.</v>

1552
01:05:12.301 --> 01:05:14.070
<v Speaker 5>How do you define upset?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And He that was the.</v>

1553
01:05:14.071 --> 01:05:15.690
<v Speaker 5>That's the question that a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 5>trials,</v>

1554
01:05:15.691 --> 01:05:16.140
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1555
01:05:16.141 --> 01:05:17.980
<v Speaker 5>community standards and this is why it's</v>

1556
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:23.010
<v Speaker 1>in trouble and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would love to know where all like the </v>

1557
01:05:23.010 --> 01:05:25.891
<v Speaker 1>fucking libertarian political </v>
<v Speaker 1>organizations where when Max hardcore </v>

1558
01:05:25.891 --> 01:05:26.140
<v Speaker 1>went to jail for four years because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>nailed him when he,</v>

1559
01:05:26.141 --> 01:05:31.141
<v Speaker 1>when he mailed stuff to fucking Tampa </v>
<v Speaker 1>because Florida stinkers type of stuff </v>

1560
01:05:31.141 --> 01:05:33.340
<v Speaker 1>and they trapped them and got them on </v>
<v Speaker 1>some obscene community standards thing,</v>

1561
01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:35.550
<v Speaker 1>but when we wizard but he's sticking up </v>
<v Speaker 1>for Max hardcore.</v>

1562
01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:38.050
<v Speaker 1>This guy did for years for adult </v>
<v Speaker 1>pornography.</v>

1563
01:05:38.380 --> 01:05:40.570
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking adults.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no children involved.</v>

1564
01:05:40.590 --> 01:05:45.590
<v Speaker 1>It seems really strange that you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>have something that is not illegal.</v>

1565
01:05:46.990 --> 01:05:50.050
<v Speaker 1>That is obviously it's marketable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1566
01:05:50.051 --> 01:05:52.300
<v Speaker 1>whether or not it's healthy to watch </v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of shit.</v>

1567
01:05:52.540 --> 01:05:57.540
<v Speaker 1>It's obviously people are watching it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there is always that argument that </v>

1568
01:05:57.540 --> 01:06:01.561
<v Speaker 1>certain types of depravity keeps people </v>
<v Speaker 1>from committing things in the real life </v>

1569
01:06:01.561 --> 01:06:03.430
<v Speaker 1>that they can get through it in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a fantasy form and it keeps them</v>

1570
01:06:03.431 --> 01:06:04.560
<v Speaker 1>from being a creep or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1571
01:06:04.570 --> 01:06:06.430
<v Speaker 1>a violent person in their real life.</v>

1572
01:06:07.060 --> 01:06:09.640
<v Speaker 1>And if some of the signs of fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>waiver man and what,</v>

1573
01:06:09.641 --> 01:06:14.641
<v Speaker 1>where do you cross the line?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where do you decide that this is </v>

1574
01:06:14.641 --> 01:06:17.371
<v Speaker 1>something that this guy needs to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>locked in a cage for because you don't </v>

1575
01:06:17.371 --> 01:06:20.491
<v Speaker 1>agree with the whole country is full of </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit when it comes to free speech and </v>

1576
01:06:20.491 --> 01:06:20.620
<v Speaker 1>free thought because all of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I mean,</v>

1577
01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:23.170
<v Speaker 1>well I shouldn't say all ideologies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>liberal and conservative,</v>

1578
01:06:23.171 --> 01:06:28.171
<v Speaker 1>haven't asked her as like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're free to say this and do this as </v>

1579
01:06:28.171 --> 01:06:28.171
<v Speaker 1>long as you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1580
01:06:28.171 --> 01:06:32.690
<v Speaker 1>and for the liberals it's what they call</v>
<v Speaker 1>hate speech and anything that's racial </v>

1581
01:06:32.690 --> 01:06:32.890
<v Speaker 1>or homophobia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for the conservatives,</v>

1582
01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:33.460
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1583
01:06:33.461 --> 01:06:37.210
<v Speaker 1>don't fuck with God and country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but both sides are equally phony when it</v>

1584
01:06:37.211 --> 01:06:38.740
<v Speaker 1>comes to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when's the last time,</v>

1585
01:06:39.070 --> 01:06:44.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a feminist stuck up for a guy who </v>

1586
01:06:44.070 --> 01:06:47.881
<v Speaker 1>said something about women that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>unpleasant because he has the right to </v>

1587
01:06:47.881 --> 01:06:47.890
<v Speaker 1>say it never.</v>

1588
01:06:48.190 --> 01:06:49.270
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where were all these people?</v>

1589
01:06:49.271 --> 01:06:54.271
<v Speaker 1>When Tracy Morgan said what he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why didn't nobody who didn't like him </v>

1590
01:06:54.271 --> 01:06:58.171
<v Speaker 1>stick up for all countries for it's just</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they don't have that much </v>

1591
01:06:58.171 --> 01:07:02.431
<v Speaker 1>resources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like they can jump into the </v>

1592
01:07:02.431 --> 01:07:04.741
<v Speaker 1>fray for any little situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have that much time when </v>

1593
01:07:04.741 --> 01:07:06.640
<v Speaker 1>you're running some sort of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization that's looking for violence</v>

1594
01:07:06.641 --> 01:07:08.980
<v Speaker 1>against women or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't have,</v>

1595
01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:11.170
<v Speaker 1>you have to look at concentrate only on </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1596
01:07:11.171 --> 01:07:14.050
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't fault them for going after,</v>

1597
01:07:14.170 --> 01:07:16.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or not going after cases where guys like</v>

1598
01:07:16.751 --> 01:07:21.751
<v Speaker 1>Tracy Morgan got busted or now they only</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a certain amount of things they </v>

1599
01:07:21.751 --> 01:07:21.751
<v Speaker 1>want to concentrate on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>

1600
01:07:21.751 --> 01:07:25.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean I fault them for going after him </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he was like,</v>

1601
01:07:25.501 --> 01:07:27.010
<v Speaker 1>why don't like when people went after </v>
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>

1602
01:07:27.011 --> 01:07:28.600
<v Speaker 1>why didn't they just stick up for them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and go,</v>

1603
01:07:28.601 --> 01:07:31.570
<v Speaker 1>we don't like what he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's got the right to say it.</v>

1604
01:07:31.630 --> 01:07:33.400
<v Speaker 1>There should be no penalty for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I mean.</v>

1605
01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:35.860
<v Speaker 1>And none of these groups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would take them two seconds to put</v>

1606
01:07:35.861 --> 01:07:38.260
<v Speaker 1>out that fucking memo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but glad has never done it.</v>

1607
01:07:38.410 --> 01:07:39.590
<v Speaker 1>None of them have done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1608
01:07:39.591 --> 01:07:44.591
<v Speaker 1>they no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't devote any resources to </v>

1609
01:07:44.591 --> 01:07:46.561
<v Speaker 1>helping anybody else out there develop </v>
<v Speaker 1>resources to pushing their ideology and </v>

1610
01:07:46.561 --> 01:07:50.050
<v Speaker 1>their ideology is that this guy needs to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be punished because if he's punished and</v>

1611
01:07:50.051 --> 01:07:55.051
<v Speaker 1>it cost him a lot of money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then people are going to stop thinking </v>

1612
01:07:55.051 --> 01:07:57.241
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna stop expressing themselves </v>

1613
01:07:57.241 --> 01:07:59.221
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I can see their point it up to a </v>

1614
01:07:59.221 --> 01:08:00.460
<v Speaker 1>certain point where you got to realize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it okay?</v>

1615
01:08:01.060 --> 01:08:02.200
<v Speaker 1>Where does this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where does this,</v>

1616
01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:05.740
<v Speaker 1>where's this line happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it okay for Denzel Washington to play</v>

1617
01:08:05.741 --> 01:08:08.560
<v Speaker 1>a murderer and a gangster and a movie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

1618
01:08:08.561 --> 01:08:09.760
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1619
01:08:09.970 --> 01:08:14.970
<v Speaker 1>Why is it not okay for Tracy Morgan to </v>
<v Speaker 1>portray a guy who's pretending that he </v>

1620
01:08:15.591 --> 01:08:16.160
<v Speaker 1>would stab</v>

1621
01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:18.950
<v Speaker 3>his son if he was gay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because he's not telling the truth.</v>

1622
01:08:19.050 --> 01:08:19.670
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

1623
01:08:19.790 --> 01:08:24.790
<v Speaker 3>he's obviously doing a character that is</v>
<v Speaker 3>like completely over the top and says </v>

1624
01:08:24.790 --> 01:08:26.210
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous shit all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That his.</v>

1625
01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:27.800
<v Speaker 3>That's his shtick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1626
01:08:27.801 --> 01:08:29.750
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was incorrect when I apologize.</v>

1627
01:08:29.751 --> 01:08:31.400
<v Speaker 3>You just straighten me out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I said the women's groups,</v>

1628
01:08:31.401 --> 01:08:33.050
<v Speaker 3>I should have said the gay groups.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking that it was.</v>

1629
01:08:33.051 --> 01:08:35.450
<v Speaker 3>Tracy said something that was anti </v>
<v Speaker 3>woman.</v>

1630
01:08:35.451 --> 01:08:37.450
<v Speaker 3>I forgot that it was that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually forgot what I just went.</v>

1631
01:08:37.470 --> 01:08:42.470
<v Speaker 3>Remember the conflict?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying why doesn't the group was </v>

1632
01:08:42.470 --> 01:08:42.470
<v Speaker 3>saying that gay dudes are women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1633
01:08:42.470 --> 01:08:43.130
<v Speaker 3>so all the great ones are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1634
01:08:43.131 --> 01:08:46.040
<v Speaker 3>let's be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who hasn't seen a transexual and fall in</v>

1635
01:08:46.041 --> 01:08:48.320
<v Speaker 3>love with them on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an open society folks.</v>

1636
01:08:48.380 --> 01:08:51.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Tracy got to.</v>

1637
01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:54.770
<v Speaker 3>People have to understand that it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that want to see him do that.</v>

1638
01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:57.320
<v Speaker 3>You might not like it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like dice.</v>

1639
01:08:57.380 --> 01:08:59.450
<v Speaker 3>I'd love dice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always loved dice.</v>

1640
01:08:59.451 --> 01:09:04.451
<v Speaker 3>I want to see him go fucking bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a form of entertainment and if he </v>

1641
01:09:04.451 --> 01:09:05.000
<v Speaker 3>does it about Italians,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I am,</v>

1642
01:09:05.180 --> 01:09:06.350
<v Speaker 3>I will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will laugh.</v>

1643
01:09:06.410 --> 01:09:07.990
<v Speaker 3>I will laugh along with it because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

1644
01:09:07.991 --> 01:09:09.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if he's making fun of us,</v>

1645
01:09:09.321 --> 01:09:11.780
<v Speaker 3>it's mostly true shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1646
01:09:11.781 --> 01:09:16.781
<v Speaker 3>but for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people want to pretend that you </v>

1647
01:09:16.781 --> 01:09:17.390
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of his ridiculous over the top.</v>

1648
01:09:17.391 --> 01:09:21.020
<v Speaker 3>Stereotypes aren't funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hilarious character.</v>

1649
01:09:21.170 --> 01:09:24.800
<v Speaker 3>This character will fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd love it.</v>

1650
01:09:24.801 --> 01:09:29.801
<v Speaker 3>It's great entertainment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I swallow my load yet chew it takes that</v>

1651
01:09:30.471 --> 01:09:32.480
<v Speaker 3>seriously.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I mean it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is just a.</v>

1654
01:09:34.940 --> 01:09:37.220
<v Speaker 3>This is entertainment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's comedy and it's a.</v>

1655
01:09:37.390 --> 01:09:40.220
<v Speaker 3>it's a valid form of comedy and this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>where it gets weird.</v>

1656
01:09:40.221 --> 01:09:45.221
<v Speaker 3>It's like when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when a guys creating art and believe it </v>

1657
01:09:45.221 --> 01:09:45.740
<v Speaker 3>or not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tracy Morgan's creating fucking art.</v>

1658
01:09:45.740 --> 01:09:47.360
<v Speaker 3>When he gets on stage and he does stand </v>
<v Speaker 3>up,</v>

1659
01:09:48.860 --> 01:09:52.610
<v Speaker 3>he's not trying to fucking piss people </v>
<v Speaker 3>off.</v>

1660
01:09:52.790 --> 01:09:55.280
<v Speaker 3>He's just going with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is one of the.</v>

1661
01:09:55.310 --> 01:09:59.510
<v Speaker 3>This is one of the styles of comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You say completely outrageous shit.</v>

1662
01:09:59.511 --> 01:10:04.511
<v Speaker 3>We all know guys who would sit like </v>
<v Speaker 3>Brian Holtzman is one of my perfect </v>

1663
01:10:04.511 --> 01:10:04.511
<v Speaker 3>examples.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brian,</v>

1664
01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:08.690
<v Speaker 3>he did a joke about Susan Smith after,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after,</v>

1665
01:10:08.691 --> 01:10:10.730
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Susan Smith got caught drowning.</v>

1666
01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:13.550
<v Speaker 3>He goes on stage like two days later and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>

1667
01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:16.520
<v Speaker 3>this Susan Smith case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she'd drawn a kids.</v>

1668
01:10:16.521 --> 01:10:18.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I heard those were bad kids.</v>

1669
01:10:18.890 --> 01:10:22.310
<v Speaker 3>I heard they sat that close to the TV.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They always spelt the fucking milk.</v>

1670
01:10:22.311 --> 01:10:24.860
<v Speaker 3>They don't put away that blocks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those kids will not be met.</v>

1671
01:10:25.790 --> 01:10:30.410
<v Speaker 3>And we were laughing and gasping the </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole audience.</v>

1672
01:10:30.411 --> 01:10:32.780
<v Speaker 3>It was a combination of laughs and </v>
<v Speaker 3>gasps.</v>

1673
01:10:33.110 --> 01:10:36.410
<v Speaker 3>And that's a valid piece of art.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a valid piece of art.</v>

1674
01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:40.100
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't really mean that he isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he had to choose,</v>

1675
01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:45.160
<v Speaker 3>he would say yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>please go back in time and stop her </v>

1676
01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:45.160
<v Speaker 3>before she tells her children he's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>character.</v>

1677
01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:48.440
<v Speaker 3>He's playing a crazy accentuated </v>
<v Speaker 3>character.</v>

1678
01:10:48.441 --> 01:10:52.340
<v Speaker 3>He gets into a zone and he does this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this thing onstage and he says like,</v>

1679
01:10:52.341 --> 01:10:56.330
<v Speaker 3>really offensive shit and it's fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>funny and I enjoy it.</v>

1680
01:10:56.390 --> 01:11:01.270
<v Speaker 3>It's art or even when you're just being </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself and exploring a ridiculous sap,</v>

1681
01:11:01.580 --> 01:11:04.190
<v Speaker 3>but we never.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People never stick up for that,</v>

1682
01:11:04.191 --> 01:11:09.191
<v Speaker 3>and the same people that would defend </v>
<v Speaker 3>maple thorp or any other form of art </v>

1683
01:11:09.191 --> 01:11:13.360
<v Speaker 3>piss Christ and a jar are the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's the same mentality that will </v>

1684
01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:15.080
<v Speaker 3>attack tracy or that will attack a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1685
01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:16.350
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I missed what he said,</v>

1686
01:11:16.351 --> 01:11:17.040
<v Speaker 3>or Michael.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Richard.</v>

1687
01:11:17.130 --> 01:11:20.390
<v Speaker 3>It's a fraudulent stance and every side </v>
<v Speaker 3>does it.</v>

1688
01:11:20.391 --> 01:11:22.340
<v Speaker 3>It drives me fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's,</v>

1689
01:11:22.350 --> 01:11:22.710
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1690
01:11:22.820 --> 01:11:27.820
<v Speaker 3>Is people have this idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people I should say have this </v>

1691
01:11:27.820 --> 01:11:31.581
<v Speaker 3>idea that if you don't agree with them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're wrong and your,</v>

1692
01:11:31.601 --> 01:11:32.260
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

1693
01:11:32.270 --> 01:11:33.050
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're,</v>

1694
01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:34.290
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're against them.</v>

1695
01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:39.320
<v Speaker 3>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like you can enjoy different </v>

1696
01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:41.541
<v Speaker 3>things or have different ideas about </v>
<v Speaker 3>different standards of living and what </v>

1697
01:11:41.541 --> 01:11:41.541
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't be able to do.</v>

1698
01:11:41.541 --> 01:11:42.210
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not that.</v>

1699
01:11:42.211 --> 01:11:47.211
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you don't agree you're wrong and </v>

1700
01:11:47.211 --> 01:11:47.910
<v Speaker 3>people have to understand that different</v>
<v Speaker 3>people like different shit.</v>

1701
01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:52.960
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you can't force someone to not like </v>

1702
01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:56.420
<v Speaker 3>porn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't force someone to say you're </v>

1703
01:11:56.420 --> 01:11:56.420
<v Speaker 3>not gay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1704
01:11:56.420 --> 01:11:56.850
<v Speaker 3>you cannot be gay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not.</v>

1705
01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.650
<v Speaker 3>You can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't work.</v>

1706
01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:03.920
<v Speaker 3>Like you have to let people do whatever </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fuck they want to do and then you </v>

1707
01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:03.920
<v Speaker 3>just got to kind of accept that that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

1708
01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:05.730
<v Speaker 3>And I wish a lot of these phony artists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I say,</v>

1709
01:12:05.810 --> 01:12:10.810
<v Speaker 3>following meaning singers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that they're hit by attacking </v>

1710
01:12:10.810 --> 01:12:10.810
<v Speaker 3>Christianity.</v>

1711
01:12:10.810 --> 01:12:10.910
<v Speaker 3>Like I have no profit attack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Christianity finally.</v>

1712
01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:15.980
<v Speaker 3>Sure it's right there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like none of them address </v>

1713
01:12:15.980 --> 01:12:18.801
<v Speaker 3>Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>None of them addressed the fact that </v>

1714
01:12:18.801 --> 01:12:21.621
<v Speaker 3>they're afraid to attack is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what drives me crazy because </v>

1715
01:12:21.621 --> 01:12:22.200
<v Speaker 3>it's this fucking fake edge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the,</v>

1716
01:12:22.201 --> 01:12:24.540
<v Speaker 3>it's this fucking fake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm being dangerous.</v>

1717
01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:29.720
<v Speaker 3>But it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're looking both ways before they </v>

1718
01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:31.581
<v Speaker 3>cross the street and they're acting like</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just bolted out the front door and </v>

1719
01:12:31.581 --> 01:12:31.800
<v Speaker 3>it fucking drives me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It drives me nuts.</v>

1720
01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:33.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the,</v>

1721
01:12:33.780 --> 01:12:36.720
<v Speaker 3>there's a certain amount of posturing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that people,</v>

1722
01:12:36.721 --> 01:12:41.721
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people get into when they start talking </v>

1723
01:12:41.721 --> 01:12:41.970
<v Speaker 3>about certain political issues and </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain things,</v>

1724
01:12:42.090 --> 01:12:47.090
<v Speaker 3>certain ideologies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it gets to that gross place where </v>

1725
01:12:47.090 --> 01:12:49.140
<v Speaker 3>people just start clapping and you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>tell they're disingenuous and it just,</v>

1726
01:12:49.310 --> 01:12:51.960
<v Speaker 3>there were milking off this thing for </v>
<v Speaker 3>their own ego.</v>

1727
01:12:52.290 --> 01:12:57.290
<v Speaker 3>They're milking off this reality for </v>
<v Speaker 3>their own ego instead of just sort of </v>

1728
01:12:57.290 --> 01:12:57.290
<v Speaker 3>trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1729
01:12:57.290 --> 01:12:59.340
<v Speaker 3>trying to look at the big picture </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the big.</v>

1730
01:13:00.270 --> 01:13:05.270
<v Speaker 3>I mean you're absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why doesn't anybody want to make fun of </v>

1731
01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:05.270
<v Speaker 3>Islam?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you why.</v>

1732
01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:06.340
<v Speaker 3>Because they'll fucking kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1733
01:13:06.341 --> 01:13:08.790
<v Speaker 3>Like they took shit to an entirely </v>
<v Speaker 3>different place.</v>

1734
01:13:09.390 --> 01:13:12.060
<v Speaker 3>And so anybody who wants to pretend to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be edgy,</v>

1735
01:13:12.270 --> 01:13:14.760
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't involve going that far.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mock them,</v>

1736
01:13:14.761 --> 01:13:16.820
<v Speaker 3>but I mean I can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm careful where I put the joe come out</v>

1737
01:13:16.850 --> 01:13:17.880
<v Speaker 3>an idiot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1738
01:13:17.881 --> 01:13:22.881
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm not crazy though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You right now just admitted to self </v>

1739
01:13:22.881 --> 01:13:24.210
<v Speaker 3>censorship for the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just find it more reasonable because</v>

1740
01:13:24.211 --> 01:13:26.400
<v Speaker 3>you say that your take on it as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1741
01:13:26.401 --> 01:13:27.520
<v Speaker 3>I'll take it back a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1742
01:13:27.540 --> 01:13:32.540
<v Speaker 3>as far as I'm sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you are clearly saying that you </v>

1743
01:13:32.540 --> 01:13:32.730
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't say what you'd normally would </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to say because they're dangerous.</v>

1744
01:13:32.790 --> 01:13:37.790
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I will say that that's why I'm not </v>

1745
01:13:37.790 --> 01:13:37.790
<v Speaker 3>saying it isn't that amazing.</v>

1746
01:13:37.790 --> 01:13:41.330
<v Speaker 3>It's a terrifying thing in 2012 that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>still have a faction of our world that </v>

1747
01:13:41.761 --> 01:13:44.430
<v Speaker 3>you have to literally can't draw their </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy,</v>

1748
01:13:44.490 --> 01:13:47.840
<v Speaker 3>but I also won't say other things </v>
<v Speaker 3>onstage for feeling like,</v>

1749
01:13:47.850 --> 01:13:48.540
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1750
01:13:48.541 --> 01:13:50.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>niggers a rough word to pull out.</v>

1751
01:13:50.551 --> 01:13:52.080
<v Speaker 3>You better have a reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1752
01:13:52.260 --> 01:13:54.000
<v Speaker 3>For you say that on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't just go out and.</v>

1753
01:13:54.001 --> 01:13:55.680
<v Speaker 3>I would never say it in anger at </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody,</v>

1754
01:13:56.860 --> 01:14:01.860
<v Speaker 3>but it's like every.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything has lines and stuff and </v>

1755
01:14:01.860 --> 01:14:04.770
<v Speaker 3>reasons I don't say it and I do self </v>
<v Speaker 3>center and I think we all do as comics </v>

1756
01:14:04.770 --> 01:14:04.770
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to.</v>

1757
01:14:04.770 --> 01:14:07.130
<v Speaker 3>We're not crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I never want people to panelize when</v>

1758
01:14:07.131 --> 01:14:08.410
<v Speaker 3>they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the difference.</v>

1759
01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:08.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it's,</v>

1760
01:14:09.470 --> 01:14:11.920
<v Speaker 3>it's really crazy when you get to like </v>
<v Speaker 3>these</v>

1761
01:14:12.190 --> 01:14:17.190
<v Speaker 1>guys that were American Muslim converts </v>
<v Speaker 1>that were publicly online calling for </v>

1762
01:14:19.151 --> 01:14:22.810
<v Speaker 1>the death of Matt stone and Trey Parker </v>
<v Speaker 1>for doing unc.</v>

1763
01:14:22.811 --> 01:14:27.811
<v Speaker 1>My drawing of Mohamad no matter which </v>
<v Speaker 1>side of it,</v>

1764
01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:30.960
<v Speaker 1>you'd probably not even allowed to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that if I said that,</v>

1765
01:14:30.961 --> 01:14:32.970
<v Speaker 1>that that's probably like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1766
01:14:33.190 --> 01:14:38.190
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a thing for Bloomberg was </v>
<v Speaker 1>sell on the money too because when they </v>

1767
01:14:40.421 --> 01:14:44.170
<v Speaker 1>found that car bomb in time square,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mike Bloomberg right on it,</v>

1768
01:14:44.171 --> 01:14:44.980
<v Speaker 1>he comes out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

1769
01:14:45.190 --> 01:14:47.130
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's not jump to conclusions.</v>

1770
01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:52.320
<v Speaker 1>How do you know it's not somebody </v>
<v Speaker 1>against healthcare be and because we </v>

1771
01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:56.611
<v Speaker 1>live in America in 2011 dummy and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>know it's somebody from Islam we know </v>

1772
01:14:56.611 --> 01:14:56.611
<v Speaker 1>and we will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1773
01:14:57.190 --> 01:14:59.230
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird thing that that's going on </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

1774
01:14:59.290 --> 01:15:01.090
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird thing when you watch like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1775
01:15:01.390 --> 01:15:06.390
<v Speaker 1>any of the videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>videos of like the real extremists in </v>

1776
01:15:06.390 --> 01:15:09.931
<v Speaker 1>different parts of the world and see </v>
<v Speaker 1>women wearing burkas and you realize </v>

1777
01:15:09.931 --> 01:15:10.090
<v Speaker 1>this is all going on in the age of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet.</v>

1778
01:15:10.410 --> 01:15:11.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole world.</v>

1779
01:15:11.651 --> 01:15:14.920
<v Speaker 1>It's like this is not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not worked out yet.</v>

1780
01:15:15.090 --> 01:15:17.350
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is clearly not worked out yet.</v>

1781
01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:18.340
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's changing.</v>

1782
01:15:18.341 --> 01:15:23.341
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we think it's changing and he's </v>

1783
01:15:23.341 --> 01:15:23.341
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1784
01:15:23.341 --> 01:15:23.341
<v Speaker 1>facebook for Christ sake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1785
01:15:23.341 --> 01:15:26.251
<v Speaker 1>look at the Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they overthrew the government and what </v>

1786
01:15:26.251 --> 01:15:28.021
<v Speaker 1>did they do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They like the Muslim Brotherhood wants </v>

1787
01:15:28.021 --> 01:15:28.021
<v Speaker 1>Sharia law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it kind of feels like a circle.</v>

1788
01:15:28.021 --> 01:15:29.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems crazy.</v>

1789
01:15:29.021 --> 01:15:30.280
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right guys,</v>

1790
01:15:30.310 --> 01:15:32.350
<v Speaker 1>really say what you're going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

1791
01:15:32.580 --> 01:15:37.180
<v Speaker 1>I got to stand against you when you want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to kill people for drawing teddy bears,</v>

1792
01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:39.280
<v Speaker 1>because that's what the Muhammad thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

1793
01:15:39.281 --> 01:15:40.630
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was in a teddy bear suit.</v>

1794
01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:42.070
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on,</v>

1795
01:15:42.071 --> 01:15:42.940
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1796
01:15:43.060 --> 01:15:48.060
<v Speaker 1>You can't even draw a teddy bear irony.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kind of fucking religion is.</v>

1797
01:15:48.670 --> 01:15:50.860
<v Speaker 1>You guys aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have enough love going on.</v>

1798
01:15:50.890 --> 01:15:55.890
<v Speaker 1>The only way you would have this idea in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your head that you should die if you </v>

1799
01:15:55.890 --> 01:15:57.130
<v Speaker 1>draw a fucking teddy bear is if you need</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hug.</v>

1800
01:15:57.130 --> 01:15:59.110
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't draw my eyes with your bond.</v>

1801
01:15:59.111 --> 01:16:01.300
<v Speaker 1>It just for the record.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did not draw that picture.</v>

1802
01:16:01.690 --> 01:16:04.450
<v Speaker 1>Photo photo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not depiction.</v>

1803
01:16:04.630 --> 01:16:06.790
<v Speaker 1>Nobody thinks that was Mohammed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's Mas.</v>

1804
01:16:06.850 --> 01:16:11.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the Islams wouldn't kill you too </v>

1805
01:16:11.850 --> 01:16:13.591
<v Speaker 1>stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're probably just fucking Islamic </v>

1806
01:16:13.591 --> 01:16:13.591
<v Speaker 1>terrorists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1807
01:16:13.591 --> 01:16:15.070
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's go see how great would it be if we</v>

1808
01:16:15.071 --> 01:16:17.340
<v Speaker 1>got killed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not just to kind of follow.</v>

1809
01:16:17.410 --> 01:16:19.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>

01:16:19.540 --> 01:16:21.310
<v Speaker 1>There you will be performing with him </v>
<v Speaker 1>tonight.</v>

1811
01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:22.240
<v Speaker 1>I'll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you really?</v>

1812
01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:27.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're doing a show with him at the Ice </v>

1813
01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:27.720
<v Speaker 1>House.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I said Hi.</v>

<v Speaker 1>no monster.</v>

1815
01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:28.780

<v Speaker 1>He's a good guy.</v>

1816
01:16:28.810 --> 01:16:30.670
<v Speaker 1>I like him a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's an awesome guy.</v>

1817
01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:33.040
<v Speaker 1>He's like enormous in the Persian </v>
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>

1818
01:16:33.041 --> 01:16:33.580
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't he?</v>

1819
01:16:33.581 --> 01:16:35.260
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he performed a superstar.</v>

1820
01:16:35.261 --> 01:16:40.261
<v Speaker 1>I think he performs in Dubai and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these like places that I probably </v>

1821
01:16:40.261 --> 01:16:44.641
<v Speaker 1>couldn't survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meaning just because not survive </v>

1822
01:16:44.641 --> 01:16:47.041
<v Speaker 1>physically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just the language would be too </v>

1823
01:16:47.041 --> 01:16:47.041
<v Speaker 1>strong.</v>

1824
01:16:47.041 --> 01:16:47.041
<v Speaker 1>He can go overseas and do these gigs and</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1825
01:16:47.041 --> 01:16:47.530
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's huge in that community.</v>

1826
01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:48.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could get in trouble.</v>

1827
01:16:48.781 --> 01:16:50.560
<v Speaker 1>It was it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How sparks that was saying that,</v>

1828
01:16:50.561 --> 01:16:52.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he almost got arrested in Dubai.</v>

1829
01:16:52.781 --> 01:16:54.440
<v Speaker 1>Was it a house party?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had that whole story where.</v>

1830
01:16:54.620 --> 01:16:55.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1831
01:16:55.420 --> 01:16:57.580
<v Speaker 1>That was how right I was for some </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>

1832
01:16:57.620 --> 01:16:59.890
<v Speaker 1>I confused that store with him and </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone else.</v>

1833
01:16:59.891 --> 01:17:01.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

1834
01:17:01.331 --> 01:17:02.050
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1835
01:17:02.140 --> 01:17:03.710
<v Speaker 1>probably Bert Kreischer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1836
01:17:03.790 --> 01:17:05.890
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who Do I always confuse it with?</v>

1837
01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:07.210
<v Speaker 1>Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember now.</v>

1838
01:17:07.690 --> 01:17:09.410
<v Speaker 1>But Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>point is it's like,</v>

1839
01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:10.040
<v Speaker 1>it's real tricky</v>

1840
01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:12.710
<v Speaker 3>because you can get locked in jail if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you say the wrong thing.</v>

1841
01:17:12.740 --> 01:17:14.930
<v Speaker 3>The wrong thing in the wrong country is </v>
<v Speaker 3>scary.</v>

1842
01:17:14.931 --> 01:17:17.060
<v Speaker 3>That's why I don't go overseas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean people will say,</v>

1843
01:17:17.061 --> 01:17:18.260
<v Speaker 3>well do you want to perform and Dubai.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1844
01:17:18.261 --> 01:17:22.010
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't because they're pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're pretty liberal in comparison,</v>

1845
01:17:22.190 --> 01:17:23.510
<v Speaker 3>but they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

1846
01:17:23.690 --> 01:17:24.380
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on man.</v>

1847
01:17:24.381 --> 01:17:29.381
<v Speaker 3>It's a fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not exactly like performing at </v>

1848
01:17:29.381 --> 01:17:30.710
<v Speaker 3>Montreal while sparks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was him already.</v>

1849
01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:32.810
<v Speaker 6>If this is going to say it's either </v>
<v Speaker 6>Eddie for you.</v>

1850
01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:35.870
<v Speaker 6>What's the first shit?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I bet if we were on twitter right now we</v>

1851
01:17:35.871 --> 01:17:38.580
<v Speaker 6>would know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I want to say it's Eddie now.</v>

1852
01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:40.820
<v Speaker 6>I want to say it's how sparks you think.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sorry.</v>

1853
01:17:40.821 --> 01:17:45.821
<v Speaker 6>I think Eddie,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if it had another story that was </v>

1854
01:17:45.821 --> 01:17:47.531
<v Speaker 6>similar,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I don't think it was the one that </v>

1855
01:17:47.531 --> 01:17:47.531
<v Speaker 6>we're thinking of where he was.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I got to,</v>

1856
01:17:47.531 --> 01:17:50.710
<v Speaker 6>he had a show and he did something and a</v>
<v Speaker 6>Dubai and something.</v>

1857
01:17:52.430 --> 01:17:53.150
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1858
01:17:53.390 --> 01:17:54.320
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

1859
01:17:54.321 --> 01:17:55.130
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you're right.</v>

1860
01:17:55.131 --> 01:17:57.420
<v Speaker 3>I think it was how sparse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but all he said was mature,</v>

1861
01:17:57.800 --> 01:17:59.180
<v Speaker 3>which I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1862
01:17:59.181 --> 01:18:02.180
<v Speaker 3>like a French,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the French name for Mr Israel.</v>

1863
01:18:02.630 --> 01:18:05.970
<v Speaker 3>That's what he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he called the Guy Mature,</v>

1864
01:18:06.020 --> 01:18:07.530
<v Speaker 3>whatever the hell his name is and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>had.</v>

1865
01:18:07.540 --> 01:18:10.220
<v Speaker 3>But the guy's real name was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like a chic.</v>

1866
01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:11.930
<v Speaker 3>So it's like he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1867
01:18:12.470 --> 01:18:17.470
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what you'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's some sort of very ominous </v>

1868
01:18:17.470 --> 01:18:18.470
<v Speaker 3>distinction that you have to give them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

1869
01:18:19.310 --> 01:18:20.230
<v Speaker 3>Whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1870
01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:22.490
<v Speaker 3>his royal highness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to say something like that.</v>

1871
01:18:22.610 --> 01:18:25.640
<v Speaker 3>You can't say mature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when he said that they,</v>

1872
01:18:25.660 --> 01:18:27.920
<v Speaker 3>they wanted to arrest him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck that.</v>

1873
01:18:28.340 --> 01:18:29.870
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's all</v>

1874
01:18:30.430 --> 01:18:34.570
<v Speaker 6>stars are always offered to go to Dubai </v>
<v Speaker 6>for like tons of money just for a week,</v>

1875
01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:38.230
<v Speaker 6>just go to Dubai for a week and be like </v>
<v Speaker 6>a princess slave or something like that.</v>

1876
01:18:38.620 --> 01:18:39.970
<v Speaker 6>And then like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

1877
01:18:40.410 --> 01:18:42.210
<v Speaker 6>like your,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your salaries,</v>

1878
01:18:42.300 --> 01:18:43.750
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in one fucking week</v>

1879
01:18:44.060 --> 01:18:45.740
<v Speaker 3>did now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did the sheik want them arrested?</v>

1880
01:18:46.100 --> 01:18:46.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>

1881
01:18:46.941 --> 01:18:47.450
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1882
01:18:47.540 --> 01:18:52.540
<v Speaker 3>She didn't want them arrested at all and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why he got away with it because </v>

1883
01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:56.780
<v Speaker 3>the royal family was taking photos with </v>
<v Speaker 3>them after the show and uh,</v>

1884
01:18:56.870 --> 01:18:58.730
<v Speaker 3>the police,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the police show up,</v>

1885
01:18:58.760 --> 01:19:00.620
<v Speaker 3>they have like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a religious police.</v>

1886
01:19:00.850 --> 01:19:03.050
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when the police showed up,</v>

1887
01:19:03.110 --> 01:19:08.110
<v Speaker 3>they released him because they said that</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was one guy's idea to arrest him and </v>

1888
01:19:08.110 --> 01:19:11.750
<v Speaker 3>that guy was wrong because if the royal </v>
<v Speaker 3>family had seen the show and he had said</v>

1889
01:19:11.751 --> 01:19:12.980
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sack religious,</v>

1890
01:19:13.190 --> 01:19:14.060
<v Speaker 3>he would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1891
01:19:14.090 --> 01:19:16.040
<v Speaker 3>they would not be wanting to take </v>
<v Speaker 3>pictures with him.</v>

1892
01:19:16.070 --> 01:19:17.840
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So based on the fact that this,</v>

1893
01:19:17.900 --> 01:19:20.270
<v Speaker 3>that hal didn't listen to them because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were saying like,</v>

1894
01:19:20.271 --> 01:19:25.271
<v Speaker 3>you wait here for the royal police or </v>
<v Speaker 3>the whatever the fuck the police was </v>

1895
01:19:25.271 --> 01:19:28.001
<v Speaker 3>called.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Hal just went outside the door and </v>

1896
01:19:28.001 --> 01:19:28.001
<v Speaker 3>started taking photos with everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>including the royal family.</v>

1897
01:19:28.001 --> 01:19:32.200
<v Speaker 3>And that's what saved them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That the royal family thought it was </v>

1898
01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:34.421
<v Speaker 3>funny because otherwise he was going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be going to jail on one person's </v>

1899
01:19:34.421 --> 01:19:34.580
<v Speaker 3>recommendation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how I remember the story,</v>

1900
01:19:34.581 --> 01:19:35.190
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was that.</v>

1901
01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:39.920
<v Speaker 3>How was my guy enough to me to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no way I could do a fucking show</v>

1902
01:19:39.921 --> 01:19:44.921
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I don't go because it scares </v>

1903
01:19:44.921 --> 01:19:46.751
<v Speaker 3>me because you don't know all the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I know in America I'm not going to </v>

1904
01:19:46.751 --> 01:19:46.751
<v Speaker 3>get arrested on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that.</v>

1905
01:19:46.751 --> 01:19:46.970
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

1906
01:19:46.971 --> 01:19:51.971
<v Speaker 3>as long as you're not calling for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>place to be fucking bombed or a murder </v>

1907
01:19:51.971 --> 01:19:52.160
<v Speaker 3>to take place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just doing my stupid act.</v>

1908
01:19:52.161 --> 01:19:53.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm never going to go to jail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not here.</v>

1909
01:19:54.140 --> 01:19:56.090
<v Speaker 3>Not here in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get in trouble though.</v>

1910
01:19:56.270 --> 01:19:58.700
<v Speaker 3>They had that fucking human rights </v>
<v Speaker 3>commission that goes after people.</v>

1911
01:19:58.701 --> 01:20:03.701
<v Speaker 3>For the guy who had the comic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who made fun of the lesbians and the </v>

1912
01:20:03.701 --> 01:20:06.251
<v Speaker 3>audience who are talking and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this stupid human rights commission </v>

1913
01:20:06.251 --> 01:20:06.251
<v Speaker 3>takes aside to the fucking hecklers.</v>

1914
01:20:06.251 --> 01:20:07.630
<v Speaker 3>So crazy guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1915
01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:09.840
<v Speaker 3>what they're saying is that what he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing was like,</v>

1916
01:20:09.841 --> 01:20:14.841
<v Speaker 3>hate speech and that should be forbidden</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he shouldn't be able to do that for </v>

1917
01:20:14.841 --> 01:20:15.180
<v Speaker 3>the stage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

1918
01:20:15.181 --> 01:20:17.340
<v Speaker 3>you don't understand if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

1919
01:20:17.590 --> 01:20:18.190
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

1920
01:20:18.191 --> 01:20:20.730
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about standup comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is an art form,</v>

1921
01:20:20.790 --> 01:20:23.760
<v Speaker 3>and we've already established that </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a fucking viable form of that art</v>

1922
01:20:23.761 --> 01:20:25.950
<v Speaker 3>form,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Ultra Offensive Don rickles style.</v>

1923
01:20:26.130 --> 01:20:31.130
<v Speaker 3>It's always existed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking hilarious when you watch a </v>

1924
01:20:31.130 --> 01:20:31.440
<v Speaker 3>guy get dressed down in front of all </v>
<v Speaker 3>these people because he says something,</v>

1925
01:20:31.540 --> 01:20:32.670
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a part of the show,</v>

1926
01:20:32.671 --> 01:20:37.671
<v Speaker 3>so when you start talking in a comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>show your you fucking give up all rights</v>

1927
01:20:38.821 --> 01:20:40.020
<v Speaker 3>to be offended.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1928
01:20:40.060 --> 01:20:45.060
<v Speaker 3>because you're now part of the show and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we've got to do whatever the fuck we </v>

1929
01:20:45.060 --> 01:20:46.680
<v Speaker 3>have to do to salvage this show for </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone else in the room.</v>

1930
01:20:46.770 --> 01:20:51.770
<v Speaker 3>There's 300 other people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but because one asshole wants to get </v>

1931
01:20:51.770 --> 01:20:55.620
<v Speaker 3>drunk and yellow and then you go after </v>
<v Speaker 3>him or her who had whatever it is,</v>

1932
01:20:55.621 --> 01:20:58.650
<v Speaker 3>and then you're in trouble because of </v>
<v Speaker 3>something harsh to.</v>

1933
01:20:58.651 --> 01:21:02.460
<v Speaker 3>You said to them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they became a part of the show.</v>

1934
01:21:02.700 --> 01:21:05.460
<v Speaker 3>When you're a part of the show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am adlibbing.</v>

1935
01:21:05.490 --> 01:21:10.490
<v Speaker 3>I can't guarantee it's going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't guarantee I'm not going to go </v>

1936
01:21:10.490 --> 01:21:10.490
<v Speaker 3>over the top.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't guarantee.</v>

1937
01:21:10.490 --> 01:21:12.000
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to say something that </v>
<v Speaker 3>really was kind of fucked up,</v>

1938
01:21:12.060 --> 01:21:16.380
<v Speaker 3>but I can guarantee the only reason I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking to you because you fucked up the</v>

1939
01:21:16.381 --> 01:21:17.080
<v Speaker 3>cell phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't.</v>

1940
01:21:17.090 --> 01:21:22.090
<v Speaker 3>He writes this selfishness that inspired</v>
<v Speaker 3>them to talk is the same selfishness </v>

1941
01:21:22.470 --> 01:21:24.660
<v Speaker 3>that makes them feel they should be </v>
<v Speaker 3>vindicated.</v>

1942
01:21:24.661 --> 01:21:29.661
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And make them feel self righteously </v>

1943
01:21:29.661 --> 01:21:31.731
<v Speaker 3>angry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like once you know somebody </v>

1944
01:21:31.731 --> 01:21:31.731
<v Speaker 3>selfish Twat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which they are,</v>

1945
01:21:31.731 --> 01:21:33.060
<v Speaker 3>when they heckle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know that going into it,</v>

1946
01:21:33.061 --> 01:21:34.920
<v Speaker 3>they're gonna usually get upset because </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1947
01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:37.110
<v Speaker 3>the they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the selfish people that self centered.</v>

1948
01:21:37.110 --> 01:21:42.110
<v Speaker 3>People like this fucking lady that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>suing this 11 year old kid for hitting </v>

1949
01:21:42.110 --> 01:21:45.621
<v Speaker 3>her in the face with a baseball standing</v>
<v Speaker 3>near where the kids are throwing </v>

1950
01:21:45.621 --> 01:21:49.251
<v Speaker 3>baseballs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She got hit in the face by a baseball </v>

1951
01:21:49.251 --> 01:21:49.251
<v Speaker 3>and she's suing this kid for half a </v>
<v Speaker 3>million dollars.</v>

1952
01:21:49.470 --> 01:21:53.960
<v Speaker 3>What kind of a fucking crazy asshole </v>
<v Speaker 3>Susan?</v>

1953
01:21:53.980 --> 01:21:56.760
<v Speaker 3>Eleven year old kid for throwing a </v>
<v Speaker 3>baseball and I'll tell you,</v>

1954
01:21:56.761 --> 01:22:01.761
<v Speaker 3>this is what's also repulsive is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened in Jersey and of course the </v>

1955
01:22:01.761 --> 01:22:04.430
<v Speaker 3>little league is not supporting them at </v>
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>

1956
01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:09.440
<v Speaker 3>That it's a matter between the dose cock</v>
<v Speaker 3>suckers fucking walked right away from </v>

1957
01:22:09.781 --> 01:22:11.820
<v Speaker 3>this guy because they weren't named in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the litigation.</v>

1958
01:22:11.821 --> 01:22:13.480
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the selfishness is,</v>

1959
01:22:13.490 --> 01:22:18.490
<v Speaker 3>is everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody is fucking self obsessed and </v>

1960
01:22:18.490 --> 01:22:18.690
<v Speaker 3>it comes from the people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why people,</v>

1961
01:22:18.691 --> 01:22:23.691
<v Speaker 3>their insurance companies rape us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why they rape us because we're </v>

1962
01:22:23.691 --> 01:22:26.991
<v Speaker 3>all fucking selfish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People sue and then the doctors have to </v>

1963
01:22:26.991 --> 01:22:27.000
<v Speaker 3>pay a higher insurance.</v>

1964
01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.260
<v Speaker 3>They charge you more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like we.</v>

1965
01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:30.390
<v Speaker 3>But we started fucking each other on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ground level.</v>

1966
01:22:30.420 --> 01:22:31.620
<v Speaker 3>But there's that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1967
01:22:31.621 --> 01:22:36.621
<v Speaker 3>I totally agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just way too many people that look at </v>

1968
01:22:36.621 --> 01:22:40.640
<v Speaker 3>lawsuits as the lottery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we've all seen videos of people </v>

1969
01:22:40.640 --> 01:22:43.170
<v Speaker 3>faking falling down when they have those</v>
<v Speaker 3>hidden security cameras and they're like</v>

1970
01:22:43.171 --> 01:22:48.171
<v Speaker 3>slip on purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see them like look around and fall </v>

1971
01:22:48.171 --> 01:22:48.840
<v Speaker 3>and then they show them the video and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they fucking bust them.</v>

1972
01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:54.080
<v Speaker 3>But there are people that really do </v>
<v Speaker 3>legitimately fucking hurt themselves </v>

1973
01:22:54.080 --> 01:22:54.080
<v Speaker 3>because of someone's negligence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

1974
01:22:54.080 --> 01:22:56.490
<v Speaker 3>If your mom is walking and some asshole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1975
01:22:56.510 --> 01:22:59.880
<v Speaker 3>mop the floor and didn't tell anybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it was still wet and didn't put up.</v>

1976
01:22:59.881 --> 01:23:04.881
<v Speaker 3>One of those little things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so everybody chills out a little danger </v>

1977
01:23:04.881 --> 01:23:05.950
<v Speaker 3>little thing and you fall and break your</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking hip.</v>

1978
01:23:06.220 --> 01:23:08.830
<v Speaker 5>You shouldn't be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You shouldn't have to pay for that.</v>

1979
01:23:09.100 --> 01:23:14.100
<v Speaker 5>Somebody fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My grandmother got hurt in a bank </v>

1980
01:23:14.100 --> 01:23:16.081
<v Speaker 5>parking lot like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She slipped and she hurt herself and I </v>

1981
01:23:16.081 --> 01:23:18.511
<v Speaker 5>think she only got a few grand,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like they kind of fucked around the </v>

1982
01:23:18.511 --> 01:23:18.511
<v Speaker 5>settlement.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She didn't get anything.</v>

1983
01:23:18.511 --> 01:23:18.511
<v Speaker 5>She was older,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hip fucked up.</v>

1984
01:23:18.511 --> 01:23:19.240
<v Speaker 5>I taste.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See both sides of it.</v>

1985
01:23:19.241 --> 01:23:24.241
<v Speaker 5>I definitely see that some people get </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucked over and buy things that other </v>

1986
01:23:24.241 --> 01:23:24.241
<v Speaker 5>people were negligent about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1987
01:23:24.241 --> 01:23:29.070
<v Speaker 5>that they should have taken </v>
<v Speaker 5>responsibility to make sure that their </v>

1988
01:23:29.070 --> 01:23:29.070
<v Speaker 5>customers were safe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I see that too,</v>

1989
01:23:29.070 --> 01:23:33.900
<v Speaker 5>but they also say that there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 5>people that look at any opportunity to </v>

1990
01:23:33.900 --> 01:23:34.180
<v Speaker 5>sue someone like it's the lottery.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Legitimate lawsuit.</v>

1991
01:23:34.181 --> 01:23:39.181
<v Speaker 5>I'm not talking about those because </v>
<v Speaker 5>there are plenty of times where you </v>

1992
01:23:39.181 --> 01:23:41.041
<v Speaker 5>should be able to see the doctor for </v>
<v Speaker 5>malpractice sows you up and he leaves </v>

1993
01:23:41.041 --> 01:23:41.980
<v Speaker 5>something in you that's grounds for a </v>
<v Speaker 5>lawsuit for sure.</v>

1994
01:23:41.980 --> 01:23:46.420
<v Speaker 5>If he makes it critical error,</v>
<v Speaker 5>should you be able to sue,</v>

1995
01:23:46.580 --> 01:23:51.580
<v Speaker 5>like should a guy be able to sue,</v>
<v Speaker 5>say if you're given a guy a massage and </v>

1996
01:23:51.580 --> 01:23:52.970
<v Speaker 5>that guy wants you to jerk them off?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

1997
01:23:52.990 --> 01:23:57.990
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think he should actually be able to </v>

1998
01:23:57.990 --> 01:23:57.990
<v Speaker 5>sue you for not offering to that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck.</v>

1999
01:23:57.990 --> 01:24:02.101
<v Speaker 5>It makes me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These guys are selling Travolta for 2 </v>

2000
01:24:02.101 --> 01:24:02.101
<v Speaker 5>million.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here's what,</v>

2001
01:24:02.101 --> 01:24:04.120
<v Speaker 5>here's what annoys me is that the guy </v>
<v Speaker 5>said he liked Travolta,</v>

2002
01:24:04.121 --> 01:24:09.121
<v Speaker 5>grabbed for his scrotum,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then he said like a few minutes </v>

2003
01:24:09.121 --> 01:24:09.121
<v Speaker 5>later,</v>
<v Speaker 5>trouble.</v>

2004
01:24:09.121 --> 01:24:09.121
<v Speaker 5>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whoa,</v>

2005
01:24:09.121 --> 01:24:10.450
<v Speaker 5>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A fucking housing later,</v>

2006
01:24:10.750 --> 01:24:12.280
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If he said,</v>

2007
01:24:12.870 --> 01:24:17.870
<v Speaker 5>if he said Travolta,</v>
<v Speaker 5>grabbed my scrotum and I drop the oil </v>

2008
01:24:17.870 --> 01:24:18.040
<v Speaker 5>and fucking ran out the door,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the guy.</v>

2009
01:24:18.041 --> 01:24:23.041
<v Speaker 5>That to me is a legitimate beef.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But what happened was he kept you going </v>

2010
01:24:23.041 --> 01:24:27.021
<v Speaker 5>to tell me as a mature,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't read that fucking body </v>

2011
01:24:27.021 --> 01:24:27.021
<v Speaker 5>language.</v>

2012
01:24:27.021 --> 01:24:27.021
<v Speaker 5>Every time I pushed my ass hole up in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the air,</v>

2013
01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:29.830
<v Speaker 5>fucking chick massage him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He knows exactly what I want.</v>

2014
01:24:30.350 --> 01:24:35.350
<v Speaker 5>Every time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>every time she creeps up my thigh and I </v>

2015
01:24:35.350 --> 01:24:36.930
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she knows I'm saying fucking goal for my</v>

2016
01:24:36.940 --> 01:24:38.380
<v Speaker 5>balls.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's an unwritten.</v>

2017
01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:38.860
<v Speaker 5>It,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

2018
01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:44.280
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're going into it with plausible </v>

2019
01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:45.721
<v Speaker 5>deniability from both people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the mature and the zoos always </v>

2020
01:24:45.721 --> 01:24:46.840
<v Speaker 5>knows.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The therapist always knows when you want</v>

2021
01:24:46.841 --> 01:24:48.790
<v Speaker 5>something extra,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they feel it.</v>

2022
01:24:48.940 --> 01:24:53.940
<v Speaker 5>They the fucking body.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So do you think that the majority of </v>

2023
01:24:54.851 --> 01:24:57.460
<v Speaker 5>guys that he propositions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you think,</v>

2024
01:24:57.500 --> 01:24:59.620
<v Speaker 5>what do you think his batting ratio is?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

2025
01:24:59.621 --> 01:25:01.330
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to guess Travolta if I had,</v>

2026
01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:06.360
<v Speaker 5>if any of it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I will speculate that he's probably </v>

2027
01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:07.030
<v Speaker 5>batting 800 or 7:50.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's got fucking,</v>

2028
01:25:07.031 --> 01:25:12.031
<v Speaker 5>he probably makes ty cobb but like a </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking rank amateur because a guy in </v>

2029
01:25:12.031 --> 01:25:12.970
<v Speaker 5>that position,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2030
01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:14.650
<v Speaker 5>first of all he's not used to hearing.</v>

2031
01:25:14.650 --> 01:25:19.650
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he has enough money to just keep </v>

2032
01:25:19.650 --> 01:25:19.650
<v Speaker 5>throwing money at you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes I've,</v>

2033
01:25:19.650 --> 01:25:22.060
<v Speaker 5>I've upped the ante.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've upped the ante with $150 massage.</v>

2034
01:25:22.061 --> 01:25:23.380
<v Speaker 5>Like come on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll be really generous.</v>

2035
01:25:23.590 --> 01:25:27.070
<v Speaker 5>And then not like email when you got </v>
<v Speaker 5>them with the other girls do that.</v>

2036
01:25:27.100 --> 01:25:28.240

<v Speaker 5>I'll let you know that you got them on </v>

2039
01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:37.630
<v Speaker 5>that question because they wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>inquire if they weren't interested.</v>

2040
01:25:37.900 --> 01:25:42.900
<v Speaker 5>Like um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one girl told me she was massaging me </v>

2041
01:25:42.900 --> 01:25:42.900

2045
01:25:45.071 --> 01:25:45.970
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and she's like,</v>

2046
01:25:46.570 --> 01:25:47.500
<v Speaker 5>I would never do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's like,</v>

2047
01:25:47.501 --> 01:25:49.090
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how much do you give them real?</v>

2048
01:25:49.510 --> 01:25:51.520
<v Speaker 5>I fucking soul.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Got You.</v>

2049
01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:52.870
<v Speaker 5>I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 5>got you.</v>

2050
01:25:52.871 --> 01:25:54.790
<v Speaker 5>And I did for 300.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She let me jerk off.</v>

2051
01:25:54.791 --> 01:25:56.920
<v Speaker 5>I rubbed her ass on the bed and I jerked</v>
<v Speaker 5>off on the floor.</v>

2052
01:25:56.950 --> 01:25:58.720
<v Speaker 5>So she gets,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she makes deals,</v>

2053
01:25:58.721 --> 01:25:59.860
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can do this,</v>

2054
01:25:59.861 --> 01:26:01.080
<v Speaker 5>but you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2055
01:26:01.090 --> 01:26:03.100
<v Speaker 5>And you kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have a certain.</v>

2056
01:26:03.110 --> 01:26:04.370
<v Speaker 5>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a certain lingo</v>

2057
01:26:04.370 --> 01:26:05.600
<v Speaker 3>you go with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't just go,</v>

2058
01:26:05.601 --> 01:26:10.601
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you this because that makes </v>
<v Speaker 3>them feel like a prostitute and they're </v>

2059
01:26:10.601 --> 01:26:13.541
<v Speaker 3>really not prostitutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just girls making a snap judgment </v>

2060
01:26:13.541 --> 01:26:16.571
<v Speaker 3>that you're okay and fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll play with them and make a little </v>

2061
01:26:16.571 --> 01:26:16.571
<v Speaker 3>extra.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2062
01:26:16.571 --> 01:26:16.571
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a way,</v>

2063
01:26:16.571 --> 01:26:21.011
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of safe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Suddenly you're going to do anything </v>

2064
01:26:21.011 --> 01:26:21.011
<v Speaker 3>crazy or in a massage parlor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2065
01:26:21.011 --> 01:26:21.200
<v Speaker 3>Neil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's usually my house.</v>

2066
01:26:21.201 --> 01:26:22.960
<v Speaker 3>I rarely bring them to your house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll do.</v>

2067
01:26:23.050 --> 01:26:25.990
<v Speaker 3>I can't pull that off in a fucking spa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They won't go near your cock and a spa.</v>

2068
01:26:25.991 --> 01:26:27.920
<v Speaker 3>They mummy wrapped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate that.</v>

2069
01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:33.280
<v Speaker 3>Whenever they lift my thigh in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>therapeutic fashion and wrapped the </v>

2070
01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:33.280
<v Speaker 3>towel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2071
01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:36.551
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what if you're having them come to your </v>

2072
01:26:36.551 --> 01:26:36.551
<v Speaker 3>house and massage you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2073
01:26:36.551 --> 01:26:38.690
<v Speaker 3>That's how many of those girls are doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hand release.</v>

2074
01:26:39.020 --> 01:26:44.020
<v Speaker 3>I'd say I've had maybe a 60 to 70 or 65 </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent of batting average,</v>

2075
01:26:44.930 --> 01:26:47.770
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of them I haven't tried it on </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I know they want.</v>

2076
01:26:48.050 --> 01:26:53.050
<v Speaker 3>When they walk in the door,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of times you can tell by the </v>

2077
01:26:53.050 --> 01:26:56.381
<v Speaker 3>attitude the vide,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the body language that they're not </v>

2078
01:26:56.381 --> 01:26:56.381
<v Speaker 3>gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do that so easy job for a girl man.</v>

2079
01:26:57.130 --> 01:27:01.250
<v Speaker 3>And do you ever go to that website,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the yelp page for that,</v>

2080
01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:04.120
<v Speaker 3>a happy endings or something like that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never knew it existed.</v>

2081
01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:09.160
<v Speaker 3>There's a page that just breaks down </v>
<v Speaker 3>every single like massage parlor and </v>

2082
01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:11.040
<v Speaker 3>girls that are like in papers and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every town.</v>

2083
01:27:13.020 --> 01:27:15.320
<v Speaker 3>I think it's happy endings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's wonderful.</v>

2084
01:27:15.350 --> 01:27:16.160
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never done that,</v>

2085
01:27:16.161 --> 01:27:18.200
<v Speaker 3>but I certainly will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty legit.</v>

2086
01:27:18.950 --> 01:27:23.950
<v Speaker 3>I think I feel okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel much different about it knowing </v>

2087
01:27:23.950 --> 01:27:26.531
<v Speaker 3>that you actually get these girls to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>to your house because I would assume </v>

2088
01:27:26.531 --> 01:27:28.880
<v Speaker 3>that most girls when they go to guy's </v>
<v Speaker 3>houses have to be thinking it was a very</v>

2089
01:27:28.881 --> 01:27:30.860
<v Speaker 3>high possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This guy might whip his dick out.</v>

2090
01:27:31.220 --> 01:27:32.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That a lot of times they know.</v>

2091
01:27:33.260 --> 01:27:35.720
<v Speaker 3>It depends on how if they go there </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of a recommendation,</v>

2092
01:27:35.721 --> 01:27:36.890
<v Speaker 3>sometimes I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2093
01:27:37.070 --> 01:27:42.070
<v Speaker 3>she knows that I go with someone to </v>
<v Speaker 3>massage me and I never do anything with </v>

2094
01:27:42.070 --> 01:27:42.070
<v Speaker 3>her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so she feels comfortable.</v>

2095
01:27:42.070 --> 01:27:46.420
<v Speaker 3>You read the thing going in and that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those therapists don't tell me you </v>

2096
01:27:46.420 --> 01:27:50.801
<v Speaker 3>didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trolls is body language and you could </v>

2097
01:27:50.801 --> 01:27:50.801
<v Speaker 3>have stopped and walked out whenever you</v>
<v Speaker 3>want it to.</v>

2098
01:27:50.801 --> 01:27:55.030
<v Speaker 3>So while I do believe their account,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe any of them deserve any </v>

2099
01:27:55.030 --> 01:27:55.030
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel bad for Travolta.</v>

2100
01:27:55.030 --> 01:27:56.840
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's got to be tortured to be,</v>

2101
01:27:56.841 --> 01:28:00.710
<v Speaker 3>to be that guy and want to do some </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that you just can't fucking do,</v>

2102
01:28:00.711 --> 01:28:01.700
<v Speaker 3>to want to come out and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2103
01:28:01.701 --> 01:28:03.780
<v Speaker 3>I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what that means Sonia,</v>

2104
01:28:03.800 --> 01:28:05.750
<v Speaker 3>for millions of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get the fuck out of here.</v>

2105
01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:07.760
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his whole situation is so we're.</v>

2106
01:28:07.770 --> 01:28:10.400
<v Speaker 3>Because look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's all not true,</v>

2107
01:28:10.670 --> 01:28:15.670
<v Speaker 3>then it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is this some crazy conspiracy </v>

2108
01:28:15.670 --> 01:28:15.770
<v Speaker 3>against this guy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what's going on is this.</v>

2109
01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:17.300
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's not true,</v>

2110
01:28:17.301 --> 01:28:22.301
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's terrible and he's being persecuted </v>

2111
01:28:22.301 --> 01:28:23.870
<v Speaker 3>and if it is true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so don't fucking massage them.</v>

2112
01:28:23.871 --> 01:28:24.620
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's up.</v>

2113
01:28:24.621 --> 01:28:29.621
<v Speaker 3>Now the cat's out of the bag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If John Travolta calls you up and it's </v>

2114
01:28:29.621 --> 01:28:32.741
<v Speaker 3>2:00</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the afternoon on a Saturday and you </v>

2115
01:28:32.741 --> 01:28:34.751
<v Speaker 3>got to go to his hotel to massage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I assume you have to suck his dick or </v>

2116
01:28:34.751 --> 01:28:35.270
<v Speaker 3>he's going to want to suck yours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know,</v>

2117
01:28:35.271 --> 01:28:36.390
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now we know.</v>

2118
01:28:36.590 --> 01:28:41.590
<v Speaker 3>Can we just leave it alone?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like why do we have to beat it into the </v>

2119
01:28:41.590 --> 01:28:41.590
<v Speaker 3>ground?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why does someone have to get sued now?</v>

2120
01:28:41.590 --> 01:28:42.950
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't go to Johnson.</v>

2121
01:28:42.980 --> 01:28:44.540
<v Speaker 3>Did you know like some guys are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2122
01:28:44.541 --> 01:28:46.550
<v Speaker 3>you already had a reputation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well then why the fuck did you go?</v>

2123
01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:49.490
<v Speaker 3>Did you go maybe their job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe the job.</v>

2124
01:28:49.491 --> 01:28:50.360
<v Speaker 3>The boss said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

2125
01:28:50.590 --> 01:28:51.890
<v Speaker 3>you've got to take this one for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>team.</v>

2126
01:28:52.070 --> 01:28:53.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think you can tell your boss like,</v>

2127
01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:55.580
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was opening his asshole the last time</v>

2128
01:28:55.581 --> 01:28:57.800
<v Speaker 3>you gotta you gotta set the rules right </v>
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>

2129
01:28:57.801 --> 01:29:00.530
<v Speaker 3>Mr Travolta.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not going to get sexual,</v>

2130
01:29:00.680 --> 01:29:02.010
<v Speaker 3>which to him must be like</v>

2131
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:07.010
<v Speaker 5>the ultimate turn on to eventually think</v>
<v Speaker 5>of his dick in your mouth after you </v>

2132
01:29:07.010 --> 01:29:09.360
<v Speaker 5>saying those words and make it even more</v>
<v Speaker 5>exciting.</v>

2133
01:29:09.390 --> 01:29:10.290
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Could you start thinking.</v>

2134
01:29:10.291 --> 01:29:15.291
<v Speaker 5>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well the question now is how much is it </v>

2135
01:29:15.291 --> 01:29:17.121
<v Speaker 5>going to take to fucking break that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>One guy was saying that travolta was </v>

2136
01:29:17.121 --> 01:29:18.970
<v Speaker 5>opening his asshole massage here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess.</v>

2137
01:29:19.370 --> 01:29:22.560
<v Speaker 5>I guess the guy wasn't taking the hint </v>
<v Speaker 5>to open his cheeks,</v>

2138
01:29:22.561 --> 01:29:24.330
<v Speaker 5>which has a phone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My God,</v>

2139
01:29:24.331 --> 01:29:29.331
<v Speaker 5>he opened his cheeks as he asking the </v>
<v Speaker 5>guy who was he asking him to fuck them </v>

2140
01:29:29.331 --> 01:29:30.040
<v Speaker 5>or just wanting to say ms dot rub rub </v>
<v Speaker 5>here.</v>

2141
01:29:30.041 --> 01:29:31.830
<v Speaker 5>Like I guess he was just getting it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If it's truly,</v>

2142
01:29:31.831 --> 01:29:36.831
<v Speaker 5>there's probably just getting sick and </v>
<v Speaker 5>tired of fucking not having his body </v>

2143
01:29:36.831 --> 01:29:36.990
<v Speaker 5>language read the way he wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cheese.</v>

2144
01:29:37.110 --> 01:29:39.330
<v Speaker 5>An animal animal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't give a fuck.</v>

2145
01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:40.710
<v Speaker 5>You're just whipping out his dick.</v>

2146
01:29:40.710 --> 01:29:42.780
<v Speaker 5>Bill Clinton's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've pulled that move though.</v>

2147
01:29:42.781 --> 01:29:44.700
<v Speaker 5>So many.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not as aggressive as him,</v>

2148
01:29:44.970 --> 01:29:48.280
<v Speaker 5>but he's trying to convert straight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Guys get Travolta.</v>

2149
01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:49.060
<v Speaker 5>I guess when you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>

2150
01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:51.800
<v Speaker 5>you're on that level,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just getting someone gay to blow you.</v>

2151
01:29:51.801 --> 01:29:53.970
<v Speaker 5>It means nothing and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to get a guy with a wife and kids</v>

2152
01:29:53.971 --> 01:29:58.971
<v Speaker 5>to stick this in his mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That would be like you only going after </v>

2153
01:29:58.971 --> 01:29:59.310
<v Speaker 5>lesbians,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like how rude.</v>

2154
01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:04.520
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're getting all creepy with lesbians </v>

2155
01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:04.520
<v Speaker 5>and going after them only.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

2156
01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:05.280
<v Speaker 5>Why are you doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2157
01:30:05.340 --> 01:30:07.350
<v Speaker 5>it's just a power thing and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't want it.</v>

2158
01:30:07.550 --> 01:30:08.070
<v Speaker 5>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't,</v>

2159
01:30:08.130 --> 01:30:09.480
<v Speaker 5>they're not interested in what you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>selling,</v>

2160
01:30:09.750 --> 01:30:11.190
<v Speaker 5>but what he wants is the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But he again,</v>

2161
01:30:11.191 --> 01:30:14.520
<v Speaker 5>he wants somebody who will do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What I want is when I get a massage,</v>

2162
01:30:14.521 --> 01:30:19.521
<v Speaker 5>if somebody jerks me off,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like it because they have to leave </v>

2163
01:30:19.521 --> 01:30:19.521
<v Speaker 5>with no complaints.</v>

2164
01:30:19.521 --> 01:30:19.521
<v Speaker 5>We're going to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just checked me off for money.</v>

2165
01:30:19.620 --> 01:30:20.980
<v Speaker 5>What are you gonna complain about it and</v>
<v Speaker 5>go like,</v>

2166
01:30:20.981 --> 01:30:22.140
<v Speaker 5>Hey Jim,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you weren't nice to me.</v>

2167
01:30:22.230 --> 01:30:25.080
<v Speaker 5>He didn't take me out to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you really do.</v>

2168
01:30:25.560 --> 01:30:28.230
<v Speaker 5>You pay for the banality of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>relationship.</v>

2169
01:30:28.630 --> 01:30:33.630
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like this is our relationship right </v>

2170
01:30:33.630 --> 01:30:35.601
<v Speaker 5>here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can not ask me for anything more if </v>

2171
01:30:35.601 --> 01:30:35.601
<v Speaker 5>I want to give you more meaning </v>
<v Speaker 5>emotionally,</v>

2172
01:30:35.601 --> 01:30:36.120
<v Speaker 5>that's great and if you want to receive </v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

2173
01:30:36.121 --> 01:30:41.121
<v Speaker 5>that's great,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you can't ask for it and get mad </v>

2174
01:30:41.121 --> 01:30:41.121
<v Speaker 5>when it's not gathered.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because the totality of our relationship</v>

2175
01:30:41.121 --> 01:30:43.500
<v Speaker 5>was I handed you money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So really weird psychology.</v>

2176
01:30:43.590 --> 01:30:48.590
<v Speaker 5>Well it's sort of like when you go to </v>
<v Speaker 5>his trip club and all of a sudden the </v>

2177
01:30:48.590 --> 01:30:51.231
<v Speaker 5>girls are coming up to you and talking </v>
<v Speaker 5>to you and asking you if you'd like a </v>

2178
01:30:51.231 --> 01:30:51.900
<v Speaker 5>dance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like giving you attention.</v>

2179
01:30:51.900 --> 01:30:56.900
<v Speaker 5>Like what is this weird world where all </v>
<v Speaker 5>of a sudden these beautiful girls come </v>

2180
01:30:56.900 --> 01:30:57.960
<v Speaker 5>towards you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2181
01:30:57.961 --> 01:31:01.350
<v Speaker 5>it's a complete reversal of the real </v>
<v Speaker 5>live scenario.</v>

2182
01:31:01.500 --> 01:31:06.500
<v Speaker 5>That's one of the reasons why it's so </v>
<v Speaker 5>intoxicating and crazy when it actually </v>

2183
01:31:06.500 --> 01:31:06.500
<v Speaker 5>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

2184
01:31:06.500 --> 01:31:07.260
<v Speaker 5>even though you know they're doing it </v>
<v Speaker 5>for money,</v>

2185
01:31:07.350 --> 01:31:12.350
<v Speaker 5>my,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my goal is to blow load my pants in the </v>

2186
01:31:12.350 --> 01:31:12.350
<v Speaker 5>Strip club.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've done that twice.</v>

2187
01:31:12.350 --> 01:31:14.040
<v Speaker 5>I've blown two loads of my pants.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was my goal or whatever I did.</v>

2188
01:31:14.041 --> 01:31:17.820
<v Speaker 5>They start lap dancing maybe once in </v>
<v Speaker 5>vegas and once in New Orleans I was able</v>

2189
01:31:17.821 --> 01:31:19.600
<v Speaker 5>to get with Louis,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ramy and Pete Corey Alley.</v>

2190
01:31:19.960 --> 01:31:24.960
<v Speaker 5>They were outside the fucking strip club</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I walked out and I had on sat and </v>

2191
01:31:24.960 --> 01:31:26.880
<v Speaker 5>boxers and I had a fucking load all over</v>
<v Speaker 5>him and I opened my things and I'm like,</v>

2192
01:31:26.881 --> 01:31:30.600
<v Speaker 5>look how great is this fucking when I.</v>

2193
01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:34.770
<v Speaker 5>When you showed everybody your load me </v>
<v Speaker 5>smell your load once at the.</v>

2194
01:31:34.850 --> 01:31:36.650
<v Speaker 5>The open.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anthony did I really?</v>

2195
01:31:36.710 --> 01:31:39.130
<v Speaker 5>You have to load like packed into your </v>
<v Speaker 5>belly button.</v>

2196
01:31:39.290 --> 01:31:44.290
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You gave it to Iraq and Iraq almost </v>

2197
01:31:44.290 --> 01:31:44.290
<v Speaker 5>threw up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you want me to smile?</v>

2198
01:31:44.290 --> 01:31:45.240
<v Speaker 5>You want to smell like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All right,</v>

2199
01:31:45.241 --> 01:31:46.450
<v Speaker 5>I'll take a shot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How was it?</v>

2200
01:31:46.451 --> 01:31:48.060
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh thanks Joe.</v>

2201
01:31:48.090 --> 01:31:51.540
<v Speaker 5>It was rough,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you guys can't do that kind of stuff</v>

2202
01:31:51.541 --> 01:31:53.250
<v Speaker 5>much anymore it seems like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2203
01:31:53.280 --> 01:31:55.650
<v Speaker 5>Or Center you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not really.</v>

2204
01:31:55.710 --> 01:32:00.710
<v Speaker 5>Honestly No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean we were careful about saying </v>

2205
01:32:00.710 --> 01:32:00.710
<v Speaker 5>things that will get us sued and certain</v>

2206
01:32:00.710 --> 01:32:05.250
<v Speaker 3>extreme language,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's a self censorship and </v>

2207
01:32:05.250 --> 01:32:09.110
<v Speaker 3>anything with like bodily fluids that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are crazy about because the different </v>

2208
01:32:09.110 --> 01:32:12.020
<v Speaker 3>with ems article and series of article </v>
<v Speaker 3>is we are on everywhere in the US and </v>

2209
01:32:12.020 --> 01:32:16.651
<v Speaker 3>Canada and we don't want to have to deal</v>
<v Speaker 3>with community standards issue because </v>

2210
01:32:16.651 --> 01:32:17.770
<v Speaker 3>we're in every fucking corner of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>country country,</v>

2211
01:32:17.771 --> 01:32:22.771
<v Speaker 3>so the Tampa laws could possibly without</v>
<v Speaker 3>a doubt to you and they haven't gotten </v>

2212
01:32:22.771 --> 01:32:23.570
<v Speaker 3>sued and I don't think they ever will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they,</v>

2213
01:32:23.690 --> 01:32:24.520
<v Speaker 3>they'll like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you never know.</v>

2214
01:32:24.521 --> 01:32:27.250
<v Speaker 3>You never want to give them a reason by </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing something that's unnecessary.</v>

2215
01:32:27.580 --> 01:32:32.580
<v Speaker 3>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand why they self protect </v>

2216
01:32:32.580 --> 01:32:32.580
<v Speaker 3>because it doesn't cost anything for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>city.</v>

2217
01:32:32.580 --> 01:32:33.610
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>none of them any money.</v>

2218
01:32:33.640 --> 01:32:36.320
<v Speaker 3>Now you're a fairly conservative guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>will come.</v>

2219
01:32:36.340 --> 01:32:41.020
<v Speaker 3>So I wouldn't say you were very similar </v>
<v Speaker 3>to me in a lot of ways that people would</v>

2220
01:32:41.021 --> 01:32:44.800
<v Speaker 3>think that you'd be liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're more of a pragmatist,</v>

2221
01:32:44.860 --> 01:32:47.560
<v Speaker 3>you're more pragmatic in your approach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you,</v>

2222
01:32:47.561 --> 01:32:49.960
<v Speaker 3>you're on like red eye all the time on </v>
<v Speaker 3>Fox and it was all this.</v>

2223
01:32:50.320 --> 01:32:54.820
<v Speaker 3>What if a guy that gets into the White </v>
<v Speaker 3>House next,</v>

2224
01:32:54.821 --> 01:32:55.810
<v Speaker 3>if someone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it,</v>

2225
01:32:56.080 --> 01:33:01.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what Mitt Romney's ideas </v>

2226
01:33:01.080 --> 01:33:01.080
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if someone is like really right wing</v>

2227
01:33:01.080 --> 01:33:01.440
<v Speaker 3>and they get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what does it meant?</v>

2228
01:33:01.450 --> 01:33:05.110
<v Speaker 3>Romney's ideas about language.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does his ideas about censorship?</v>

2229
01:33:05.320 --> 01:33:06.910
<v Speaker 3>It's more of a moderate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be to be honest,</v>

2230
01:33:06.911 --> 01:33:07.740
<v Speaker 3>because he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was evil.</v>

2231
01:33:07.800 --> 01:33:09.820
<v Speaker 3>He was the governor of Massachusetts at </v>
<v Speaker 3>one point.</v>

2232
01:33:09.880 --> 01:33:12.010
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you can be that </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservative and run Massachusetts.</v>

2233
01:33:12.190 --> 01:33:15.850
<v Speaker 3>I think he's more moderate than say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of conservatives would be.</v>

2234
01:33:16.030 --> 01:33:20.530
<v Speaker 3>Well if we say if they got a Republican </v>
<v Speaker 3>candidate that was a more conservative,</v>

2235
01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:23.530
<v Speaker 3>more radical sort of a right wing top </v>
<v Speaker 3>type of dude.</v>

2236
01:33:24.130 --> 01:33:29.130
<v Speaker 3>We mean the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We usually see some lockdowns on the </v>

2237
01:33:29.130 --> 01:33:32.920
<v Speaker 3>Internet easily could see at least some </v>
<v Speaker 3>attempts at censorship of online content</v>

2238
01:33:32.980 --> 01:33:37.840
<v Speaker 3>and censorship of satellite radio,</v>
<v Speaker 3>perhaps moving the FCC deciding that the</v>

2239
01:33:37.841 --> 01:33:40.510
<v Speaker 3>government needs to expand its,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2240
01:33:40.930 --> 01:33:45.930
<v Speaker 3>maybe those make some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>connection between certain events that </v>

2241
01:33:45.930 --> 01:33:49.051
<v Speaker 3>have happened and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what maybe we need to tone down our </v>

2242
01:33:49.051 --> 01:33:50.260
<v Speaker 3>standards and make things a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 3>nicer and they might go.</v>

2243
01:33:50.260 --> 01:33:52.340
<v Speaker 3>I mean know that satellite radio is </v>
<v Speaker 3>able.</v>

2244
01:33:52.390 --> 01:33:54.730
<v Speaker 3>Any fucking person could just turn it on</v>
<v Speaker 3>and listen to it.</v>

2245
01:33:55.030 --> 01:34:00.030
<v Speaker 3>That's not outside the realm of </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibility that they would try to to </v>

2246
01:34:00.030 --> 01:34:03.570
<v Speaker 3>clamp down and sensor satellite radio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just like they have censored </v>

2247
01:34:03.570 --> 01:34:07.291
<v Speaker 3>broadcast TV.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well they tried to get their hands on </v>

2248
01:34:07.291 --> 01:34:07.291
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They tried already,</v>

2249
01:34:07.291 --> 01:34:10.291
<v Speaker 3>but because it's a subscription service,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they that because that opens a can of </v>

2250
01:34:10.291 --> 01:34:13.891
<v Speaker 3>worms where they would have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hbo would then have to allow and then </v>

2251
01:34:13.891 --> 01:34:14.740
<v Speaker 3>they'd have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you don't have nothing on cable,</v>

2252
01:34:14.741 --> 01:34:19.741
<v Speaker 3>is regulated by the FCC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can't touch it because it's a </v>

2253
01:34:19.741 --> 01:34:21.901
<v Speaker 3>subscription service.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know if they'll ever be able </v>

2254
01:34:21.901 --> 01:34:24.121
<v Speaker 3>to get into that because that's too much</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a of a violation where the public </v>

2255
01:34:24.121 --> 01:34:25.510
<v Speaker 3>airways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their argument is the argument.</v>

2256
01:34:25.511 --> 01:34:27.070
<v Speaker 3>But I don't think they have any shot at </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting.</v>

2257
01:34:27.730 --> 01:34:28.450
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think.</v>

2258
01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:31.450
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they would either,</v>

2259
01:34:31.451 --> 01:34:36.451
<v Speaker 3>but I think they could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it is possible if the right </v>

2260
01:34:36.451 --> 01:34:36.451
<v Speaker 3>person was an office,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2261
01:34:36.451 --> 01:34:40.771
<v Speaker 3>so much of this country relies on </v>
<v Speaker 3>momentum and win with ideas.</v>

2262
01:34:42.190 --> 01:34:43.780
<v Speaker 3>Especially like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2263
01:34:44.170 --> 01:34:45.830
<v Speaker 3>people that decide what people </v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't,</v>

2264
01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:50.880
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't be able to say when you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when someone says you can't say faggot </v>

2265
01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:51.220
<v Speaker 3>or someone says you can't say retard or </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone says.</v>

2266
01:34:51.370 --> 01:34:53.860
<v Speaker 3>And we really go after people that do </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2267
01:34:54.350 --> 01:34:59.350
<v Speaker 3>You start,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get into a very tricky situation </v>

2268
01:34:59.350 --> 01:35:01.990
<v Speaker 3>where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who decides what can and can't be said </v>

2269
01:35:01.990 --> 01:35:03.770
<v Speaker 3>and that that's a weird thing when </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody's pulling back,</v>

2270
01:35:03.800 --> 01:35:08.800
<v Speaker 3>when everybody's holding off and not </v>
<v Speaker 3>honestly expressing themselves.</v>

2271
01:35:08.871 --> 01:35:13.871
<v Speaker 3>Like you can't just completely eliminate</v>
<v Speaker 3>words and the vocabulary because you've </v>

2272
01:35:13.871 --> 01:35:14.810
<v Speaker 3>decided that they hurt feelings too </v>
<v Speaker 3>much.</v>

2273
01:35:15.020 --> 01:35:18.350
<v Speaker 3>Because what about all the fun times you</v>
<v Speaker 3>have called someone a fucking retard,</v>

2274
01:35:18.610 --> 01:35:18.790
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>

2275
01:35:18.910 --> 01:35:22.040
<v Speaker 3>There's some great moments in life where</v>
<v Speaker 3>you say,</v>

2276
01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:27.160
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a fucking retard and your friends </v>

2277
01:35:27.160 --> 01:35:29.831
<v Speaker 3>are how old and and laugh and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying you shouldn't be able to do that </v>

2278
01:35:29.831 --> 01:35:34.001
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It shouldn't be able to have a positive </v>

2279
01:35:34.001 --> 01:35:36.071
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It shouldn't be able to be a fun word </v>

2280
01:35:36.071 --> 01:35:36.200
<v Speaker 3>that you can express either on the radio</v>
<v Speaker 3>or through friends,</v>

2281
01:35:36.260 --> 01:35:41.260
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really is it only negative and only </v>

2282
01:35:41.260 --> 01:35:41.260
<v Speaker 3>because of the fact that some people </v>
<v Speaker 3>negatively react to it.</v>

2283
01:35:41.300 --> 01:35:43.670
<v Speaker 3>Now it has to be eliminated really well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

2284
01:35:43.671 --> 01:35:46.490
<v Speaker 3>once again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once the naacp buried the word nigger,</v>

2285
01:35:46.491 --> 01:35:51.491
<v Speaker 3>they had that maybe that they had like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>symbolic funeral and I understood why </v>

2286
01:35:51.491 --> 01:35:54.581
<v Speaker 3>Michael Richards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what he did was shitty because </v>

2287
01:35:54.581 --> 01:35:57.341
<v Speaker 3>he was yelling at an angle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a huge difference between that </v>

2288
01:35:57.341 --> 01:35:57.341
<v Speaker 3>and saying something in the context of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>joke,</v>

2289
01:35:57.341 --> 01:35:59.360
<v Speaker 3>but once that happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once one word goes,</v>

2290
01:35:59.420 --> 01:36:04.420
<v Speaker 3>even though that's a reprehensible word </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it has a horrible history attached </v>

2291
01:36:04.420 --> 01:36:07.961
<v Speaker 3>to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that word has a history attached to it </v>

2292
01:36:07.961 --> 01:36:07.961
<v Speaker 3>that most words don't.</v>

2293
01:36:07.961 --> 01:36:07.961
<v Speaker 3>So dehumanizing word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was.</v>

2294
01:36:07.961 --> 01:36:10.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was used a lot.</v>

2295
01:36:10.310 --> 01:36:12.530
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was used in a direct,</v>

2296
01:36:12.910 --> 01:36:13.910
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oppression.</v>

2297
01:36:13.940 --> 01:36:16.760
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of reasons why it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>tremendously damaging word,</v>

2298
01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:20.030
<v Speaker 3>but the fact that it was quote unquote </v>
<v Speaker 3>removed.</v>

2299
01:36:20.180 --> 01:36:22.670
<v Speaker 3>Now everybody justifiably says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2300
01:36:22.671 --> 01:36:23.330
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I get hurt,</v>

2301
01:36:23.390 --> 01:36:25.730
<v Speaker 3>be retard hurts me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This hurts me.</v>

2302
01:36:25.731 --> 01:36:27.560
<v Speaker 3>And eventually it's going to go into </v>
<v Speaker 3>other words.</v>

2303
01:36:27.561 --> 01:36:31.760
<v Speaker 3>So you can't respect any of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I self-censor like you do because I make</v>

2304
01:36:31.761 --> 01:36:33.860
<v Speaker 3>decisions on what the reaction is going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be.</v>

2305
01:36:33.861 --> 01:36:35.330
<v Speaker 3>Is it going to get me the reaction I </v>
<v Speaker 3>want?</v>

2306
01:36:35.540 --> 01:36:38.210
<v Speaker 3>But you can't fucking regulated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't regulate lenny.</v>

2307
01:36:38.211 --> 01:36:40.340
<v Speaker 3>Bruce had it right in the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>fifties.</v>

2308
01:36:40.430 --> 01:36:42.890
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you just say it over and over again,</v>

2309
01:36:42.891 --> 01:36:44.540
<v Speaker 3>it won't mean anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that weren't hurt.</v>

2310
01:36:44.541 --> 01:36:46.700
<v Speaker 3>Some little kid's feeling right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You call him a nigger,</v>

2311
01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:47.870
<v Speaker 3>won't mean anything.</v>

2312
01:36:47.930 --> 01:36:48.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was right.</v>

2313
01:36:48.651 --> 01:36:53.120
<v Speaker 3>But I mean they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they ruined them.</v>

2314
01:36:53.121 --> 01:36:58.121
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's so sad because you just wanted to </v>

2315
01:36:58.121 --> 01:37:00.041
<v Speaker 3>do is act for the court just for one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>them to see that it wasn't obscene and </v>

2316
01:37:00.041 --> 01:37:00.041
<v Speaker 3>like fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2317
01:37:00.041 --> 01:37:02.390
<v Speaker 3>it's really a sad fucking terrifying </v>
<v Speaker 3>store.</v>

2318
01:37:02.590 --> 01:37:03.590
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Heroin,</v>

2319
01:37:03.620 --> 01:37:08.620
<v Speaker 3>all of it together without the heroin </v>
<v Speaker 3>that still would want to know what I </v>

2320
01:37:08.620 --> 01:37:09.030
<v Speaker 3>mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking ruined his life.</v>

2321
01:37:09.031 --> 01:37:10.190
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he was the,</v>

2322
01:37:10.191 --> 01:37:15.191
<v Speaker 3>the original groundbreaker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's almost like you have to have a </v>

2323
01:37:15.191 --> 01:37:15.440
<v Speaker 3>guy who's just completely wild,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like lenny,</v>

2324
01:37:15.450 --> 01:37:17.570
<v Speaker 3>the Kinda guy that would get hooked on </v>
<v Speaker 3>heroin.</v>

2325
01:37:17.780 --> 01:37:20.510
<v Speaker 3>You'd almost have to have that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'd be the first guy to really step out</v>

2326
01:37:20.511 --> 01:37:25.511
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'm conservative about stuff like </v>

2327
01:37:25.511 --> 01:37:25.511
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like about,</v>

2328
01:37:25.511 --> 01:37:25.511
<v Speaker 3>about terrorism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm conservative about crime,</v>

2329
01:37:25.511 --> 01:37:30.431
<v Speaker 3>certain tax issues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm very liberal about things like </v>

2330
01:37:30.431 --> 01:37:31.400
<v Speaker 3>gay marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the liberals have really lost me on</v>

2331
01:37:31.401 --> 01:37:31.820
<v Speaker 3>language.</v>

2332
01:37:31.830 --> 01:37:34.130
<v Speaker 3>I began to hate liberals because the </v>
<v Speaker 3>language obsession,</v>

2333
01:37:34.340 --> 01:37:36.630
<v Speaker 3>but the conservatives with their whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>antigay stance,</v>

2334
01:37:36.650 --> 01:37:40.090
<v Speaker 3>I fucking hate them for like I hate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2335
01:37:40.100 --> 01:37:42.920
<v Speaker 3>the conservatives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem on the conservative side too</v>

2336
01:37:42.921 --> 01:37:44.390
<v Speaker 3>is that during the Reagan </v>
<v Speaker 3>administration,</v>

2337
01:37:44.391 --> 01:37:46.520
<v Speaker 3>it got attached with fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 3>Christianity.</v>

2338
01:37:46.820 --> 01:37:51.820
<v Speaker 3>That's when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's when they really started to go </v>

2339
01:37:51.820 --> 01:37:51.820
<v Speaker 3>after that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that vote,</v>

2340
01:37:51.820 --> 01:37:53.780
<v Speaker 3>because it's a strong there they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they unite,</v>

2341
01:37:53.840 --> 01:37:55.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the churches are together and groups are</v>

2342
01:37:55.951 --> 01:37:56.910
<v Speaker 3>together and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2343
01:37:56.911 --> 01:37:58.090
<v Speaker 3>they unite,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unite.</v>

2344
01:37:58.110 --> 01:38:01.800
<v Speaker 3>They'll rally and boycotts certainly </v>
<v Speaker 3>antichristian things,</v>

2345
01:38:02.020 --> 01:38:03.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if something is,</v>

2346
01:38:03.331 --> 01:38:08.331
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sacrilegious or whatever they would </v>

2347
01:38:08.331 --> 01:38:08.331
<v Speaker 3>think it would be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be wrong.</v>

2348
01:38:08.331 --> 01:38:10.140
<v Speaker 3>So they rally and they make a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking noise.</v>

2349
01:38:10.170 --> 01:38:13.350
<v Speaker 3>But to boycotts work though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Selma in the sixties.</v>

2350
01:38:13.560 --> 01:38:18.560
<v Speaker 3>But look what happened to Jack Halford.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was on one of the new shows and he </v>

2351
01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:18.560
<v Speaker 3>said something about the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2352
01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:23.270
<v Speaker 3>the thugs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was talking about the Chinese </v>

2353
01:38:23.270 --> 01:38:23.270
<v Speaker 3>government and he said something kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of flack on CNN.</v>

2354
01:38:23.270 --> 01:38:24.840
<v Speaker 3>And there was Chinese people with pro </v>
<v Speaker 3>agent protesting.</v>

2355
01:38:24.841 --> 01:38:27.630
<v Speaker 3>They were very upset.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She had ended in fucking budge.</v>

2356
01:38:27.810 --> 01:38:30.060
<v Speaker 3>Nothing happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many of these things,</v>

2357
01:38:30.210 --> 01:38:32.970
<v Speaker 3>because there's always a bigger news </v>
<v Speaker 3>cycle right after it.</v>

2358
01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:34.590
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a,</v>

2359
01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:38.340
<v Speaker 3>I don't mean to take away from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Virginia Tech massacre,</v>

2360
01:38:38.490 --> 01:38:39.780
<v Speaker 3>but a few weeks after,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm Mr.</v>

2361
01:38:39.870 --> 01:38:43.110
<v Speaker 3>two weeks after the Virginia Tech Mass,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a tech massacre happened.</v>

2362
01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:46.260
<v Speaker 3>It takes people's blind off that and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then nobody's focusing on it.</v>

2363
01:38:46.261 --> 01:38:47.970
<v Speaker 3>The news isn't covering it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the boycotts,</v>

2364
01:38:48.180 --> 01:38:53.180
<v Speaker 3>the boycotts are meaningless.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just gotTa fucking plow through it </v>

2365
01:38:53.180 --> 01:38:56.810
<v Speaker 3>and ignore it or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or take it on and pointed out for the </v>

2366
01:38:56.810 --> 01:38:58.440
<v Speaker 3>phony shit that it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the boycott will probably not work.</v>

2367
01:38:58.620 --> 01:39:00.510
<v Speaker 3>That's what you have to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to put it out for the phone and</v>

2368
01:39:00.511 --> 01:39:01.320
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There it is.</v>

2369
01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:06.440
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has to be just come on to stop when </v>

2370
01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:10.970
<v Speaker 3>the problem is when networks buckle and </v>
<v Speaker 3>know companies buckle and then they do </v>

2371
01:39:10.970 --> 01:39:12.120
<v Speaker 3>and they do sure there they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrified.</v>

2372
01:39:12.390 --> 01:39:14.020
<v Speaker 3>They only see the negative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The island,</v>

2373
01:39:14.030 --> 01:39:15.350
<v Speaker 3>they only see the negative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They only see.</v>

2374
01:39:15.410 --> 01:39:20.410
<v Speaker 3>They don't see any positive aspect in </v>
<v Speaker 3>standing your ground on a controversial </v>

2375
01:39:20.410 --> 01:39:20.410
<v Speaker 3>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

2376
01:39:20.410 --> 01:39:21.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2377
01:39:21.001 --> 01:39:26.001
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because there's a bunch of fucking self </v>

2378
01:39:26.001 --> 01:39:28.200
<v Speaker 3>righteous douche bags out there that'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>get on twitter or get on facebook and </v>

2379
01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:31.851
<v Speaker 3>make these big long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I supported your company and I was </v>

2380
01:39:31.851 --> 01:39:34.410
<v Speaker 3>always up until you this and just come </v>
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

2381
01:39:34.530 --> 01:39:36.500
<v Speaker 3>stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you gained.</v>

2382
01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:38.760
<v Speaker 3>It seems like he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he stands behind most of the time.</v>

2383
01:39:38.761 --> 01:39:43.761
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure this things that bothered Dana,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he seemed like he kind of stands </v>

2384
01:39:43.761 --> 01:39:46.191
<v Speaker 3>behind his guys if he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what he feels is said is reasonable and </v>

<v Speaker 3>not like I kind of in the guys like </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing the trash,</v>

2386
01:39:47.271 --> 01:39:52.271

<v Speaker 3>Like when things have popped up in the </v>

2387
01:39:52.271 --> 01:39:52.271
<v Speaker 3>publicly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he seems like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>which I was happy to see a couple of </v>

2391
01:39:58.251 --> 01:40:02.040
<v Speaker 3>other things he didn't dump guys for and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kind of respected the way that company</v>

2392
01:40:02.041 --> 01:40:07.041
<v Speaker 3>handled things on a case by case basis </v>
<v Speaker 3>and didn't just overreact to every </v>

2393
01:40:07.041 --> 01:40:07.041
<v Speaker 3>complaint.</v>

<v Speaker 3>dumb or being people that conform to </v>
<v Speaker 3>other people's ideas.</v>

<v Speaker 3>he's not a dumb guy,</v>

2424
01:41:26.110 --> 01:41:27.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

<v Speaker 3>stupid shit that's involved in political</v>

2426
01:41:31.331 --> 01:41:36.331
<v Speaker 3>correctness.</v>

2427
01:41:36.331 --> 01:41:39.181
<v Speaker 3>opinion about everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so what he wants from the guys in </v>

2428
01:41:39.181 --> 01:41:44.011
<v Speaker 3>the company is to just represent </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself as professionally as possible </v>

01:41:44.020 --> 01:41:45.040
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

2432
01:41:50.041 --> 01:41:50.920
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to tell him how to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

01:41:50.921 --> 01:41:54.100
<v Speaker 3>He figures out how to do it.</v>

2435
01:41:59.101 --> 01:41:59.440
<v Speaker 3>with the fact that it could fight his </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking ass off.</v>

2441
01:42:07.930 --> 01:42:11.260
<v Speaker 3>were they scared to have him fight in?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I wondered like what he was when</v>

2442
01:42:11.261 --> 01:42:13.600
<v Speaker 3>I already filled in Brazil and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking scary.</v>

2443
01:42:13.660 --> 01:42:15.840
<v Speaker 3>I was scared because I was going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>ringside.</v>

2444
01:42:16.390 --> 01:42:16.930
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2445
01:42:16.931 --> 01:42:21.931
<v Speaker 3>if he wins this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see this place could get nasty because </v>

2446
01:42:21.931 --> 01:42:23.650
<v Speaker 3>he said a lot of nasty shit about Brazil</v>
<v Speaker 3>countries and about Brazilians.</v>

2447
01:42:24.190 --> 01:42:28.510
<v Speaker 3>Brazilian people are extremely proud.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's an incredible place.</v>

2448
01:42:28.510 --> 01:42:30.730
<v Speaker 3>It's such a friendly culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2449
01:42:30.731 --> 01:42:32.710
<v Speaker 3>I know they have crime and they have </v>
<v Speaker 3>problems,</v>

2450
01:42:32.860 --> 01:42:36.430
<v Speaker 3>but it is like these martial arts </v>
<v Speaker 3>events,</v>

2451
01:42:36.431 --> 01:42:39.820
<v Speaker 3>the MMA events that we've had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are so fucking fun.</v>

2452
01:42:40.090 --> 01:42:43.420
<v Speaker 3>The crowds are so enthusiastic and no </v>
<v Speaker 3>Douche bags at all.</v>

2453
01:42:43.450 --> 01:42:45.940
<v Speaker 3>Everybody there for a party,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody there for a good time.</v>

2454
01:42:46.360 --> 01:42:50.490

<v Speaker 3>route on those Brazilian fighter show.</v>

2455
01:42:50.500 --> 01:42:53.230

<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2457
01:42:54.311 --> 01:42:55.890
<v Speaker 3>I know it's hard to make a prediction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean,</v>

2458
01:42:55.891 --> 01:42:57.170
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm so fucking into.</v>

2459
01:42:57.171 --> 01:42:59.230
<v Speaker 3>I'm going into this fight with Bob Kelly</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we're doing this thing.</v>

2460
01:42:59.231 --> 01:43:00.950
<v Speaker 3>We're just talking to people and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2461
01:43:00.990 --> 01:43:01.420
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

2462
01:43:01.450 --> 01:43:03.280
<v Speaker 3>for all and a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and A.</v>

2463
01:43:03.510 --> 01:43:05.740
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe how fucking site Dan for</v>
<v Speaker 3>this fight.</v>

2464
01:43:05.830 --> 01:43:07.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm so sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why didn't move favorite,</v>

2465
01:43:07.421 --> 01:43:07.690
<v Speaker 3>by the way?</v>

2466
01:43:07.690 --> 01:43:12.240
<v Speaker 3>Do you know why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because Joe say Aldo injured his leg and</v>

2467
01:43:12.260 --> 01:43:15.880
<v Speaker 3>we supposed to defend his title in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Calgary Against Eric Koch.</v>

2468
01:43:16.440 --> 01:43:20.500
<v Speaker 3>But although had a leg injury,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they decided to create a,</v>

2469
01:43:20.501 --> 01:43:21.880
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>interim title.</v>

2470
01:43:22.260 --> 01:43:26.890
<v Speaker 3>So a tenant versus Uriah Faber for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>interim title and they moved that.</v>

2471
01:43:26.930 --> 01:43:30.160
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think that's a fucking spectacular</v>

2472
01:43:30.161 --> 01:43:30.660
<v Speaker 3>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2473
01:43:30.740 --> 01:43:32.560
<v Speaker 3>Hanan Barao was awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2474
01:43:32.890 --> 01:43:35.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm bummed out that we don't get to see </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Joseph Aldo fight,</v>

2475
01:43:35.981 --> 01:43:37.210
<v Speaker 3>but he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2476
01:43:37.240 --> 01:43:39.070
<v Speaker 3>he'll be back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they weren't going to be fighting in</v>

2477
01:43:39.071 --> 01:43:40.480
<v Speaker 3>vegas anyway.</v>

01:44:19.970 --> 01:44:24.970
<v Speaker 5>It's nice to enjoy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have friends that are musicians and I </v>

2500
01:44:24.970 --> 01:44:27.221
<v Speaker 5>really love watching musicians play </v>
<v Speaker 5>because I have no musical talent,</v>

2501
01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:30.650
<v Speaker 5>no connection to music.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So to me it's just,</v>

2502
01:44:30.651 --> 01:44:33.680
<v Speaker 5>I'm just watching someone play a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 5>guitar brilliantly.</v>

2503
01:44:33.681 --> 01:44:35.870
<v Speaker 5>I just get,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get a jazz out,</v>

2504
01:44:36.130 --> 01:44:36.770
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

2505
01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.170
<v Speaker 5>it is a weird thing though that I know </v>
<v Speaker 5>his hands.</v>

2506
01:44:42.990 --> 01:44:45.140
<v Speaker 5>There's a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I don't.</v>

2507
01:44:45.141 --> 01:44:50.141
<v Speaker 5>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't mean that I don't enjoy your </v>

2508
01:44:50.141 --> 01:44:50.141
<v Speaker 5>comedically.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know,</v>

2509
01:44:50.141 --> 01:44:50.141
<v Speaker 5>I know exactly what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You,</v>

2510
01:44:50.141 --> 01:44:50.141
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2511
01:44:50.141 --> 01:44:54.790
<v Speaker 5>when we watch comedians,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sometimes I try to be a fan of comedy </v>

2512
01:44:54.790 --> 01:44:58.000
<v Speaker 5>because I really do love it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I do watch a lot of Comedians I've </v>

2513
01:44:58.000 --> 01:44:59.600
<v Speaker 5>watched guys I work with and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>worry about it influenced me too much.</v>

2514
01:44:59.601 --> 01:45:02.330
<v Speaker 5>I think I pretty much had my own idea of</v>
<v Speaker 5>what I do now,</v>

2515
01:45:02.600 --> 01:45:07.600
<v Speaker 5>but I know the feeling that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean we've all been influenced by </v>

2516
01:45:07.600 --> 01:45:07.730
<v Speaker 5>other comedians and we've all caught </v>
<v Speaker 5>her.</v>

2517
01:45:07.731 --> 01:45:11.690
<v Speaker 5>So when I was young I caught myself </v>
<v Speaker 5>doing Richard Jenny wants on stage and I</v>

2518
01:45:11.930 --> 01:45:14.270
<v Speaker 5>really realized I was doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2519
01:45:14.271 --> 01:45:15.530
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it sounded like,</v>

2520
01:45:15.531 --> 01:45:16.100
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2521
01:45:16.240 --> 01:45:17.070
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2522
01:45:17.310 --> 01:45:19.650
<v Speaker 5>it just sounded so disgusting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

2523
01:45:20.120 --> 01:45:22.400
<v Speaker 5>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a sort of a natural thing sometimes</v>

2524
01:45:22.401 --> 01:45:26.000
<v Speaker 5>to be influenced by someone that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>admire or someone who does really well.</v>

2525
01:45:26.060 --> 01:45:31.060
<v Speaker 5>It's like catching yourself in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>mirror when you're walking to get the </v>

2526
01:45:31.060 --> 01:45:31.910
<v Speaker 5>comrade.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just give a glance at yourself as you're</v>

2527
01:45:31.911 --> 01:45:33.620
<v Speaker 5>fucking looking down your leg and you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I bet you that's what it's like.</v>

<v Speaker 5>If you're washing off a strap on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>catch yourself in the fucking bathroom </v>

2533

<v Speaker 5>have to go back and clean it more.</v>

2535
01:45:51.810 --> 01:45:56.810
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You just keep smelling it when you </v>

2536
01:45:56.810 --> 01:45:56.810
<v Speaker 5>finish everything to alk to throw it </v>
<v Speaker 5>back.</v>

2537
01:45:56.810 --> 01:45:57.220
<v Speaker 5>Whoa.</v>

<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2541
01:46:02.180 --> 01:46:07.180

<v Speaker 5>and throw in the trash and throw it out </v>

2596
01:48:17.291 --> 01:48:21.401
<v Speaker 9>couldn't cut on.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So they just kept growing and growing </v>

2597
01:48:21.401 --> 01:48:22.490
<v Speaker 9>and I kept setting dates and dates that </v>
<v Speaker 9>I was gonna do it.</v>

2598
01:48:22.491 --> 01:48:27.491

<v Speaker 9>out worldwide notoriety.</v>

2599
01:48:29.030 --> 01:48:34.030
<v Speaker 9>And,</v>

01:48:37.521 --> 01:48:42.521
<v Speaker 5>a in the Midwest,</v>
<v Speaker 5>although her nails go under her forearm </v>

2603
01:48:42.521 --> 01:48:43.310
<v Speaker 5>while she was writing,</v>

2604
01:48:44.230 --> 01:48:48.640
<v Speaker 9>the door was open and I looked out and I</v>
<v Speaker 9>could see the road going and um,</v>

2605
01:48:50.090 --> 01:48:55.090
<v Speaker 9>I just felt kind of like a section and I</v>
<v Speaker 9>remember nothing after the feeling of </v>

2606
01:48:57.501 --> 01:49:02.501
<v Speaker 9>being sucked out of the vehicle,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the first thing I spotted was a </v>

2607
01:49:02.501 --> 01:49:04.430
<v Speaker 9>fingernail and I did.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Oh,</v>

01:49:04.700 --> 01:49:07.340
<v Speaker 9>I kind of started to cry.</v>
<v Speaker 9>There's one of my fingernails.</v>

2609
01:49:08.020 --> 01:49:09.100
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's great.</v>

2610
01:49:09.220 --> 01:49:14.220

<v Speaker 5>I couldn't have had a better ending as </v>

2611
01:49:14.220 --> 01:49:14.260
<v Speaker 5>far as I'm concerned.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Good ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is crazy.</v>

2613
01:49:16.301 --> 01:49:19.660
<v Speaker 5>I wonder if her nails were the fault of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the accident,</v>

2614
01:49:19.661 --> 01:49:21.450
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>She probably couldn't steer properly.</v>

2615
01:49:21.490 --> 01:49:22.180
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2616
01:49:22.210 --> 01:49:27.210
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I probably couldn't grip the fucking </v>

2617
01:49:27.210 --> 01:49:27.210
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at this guy here.</v>

2618
01:49:27.210 --> 01:49:27.330

2619
01:49:27.430 --> 01:49:29.050
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look at those things.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2621
01:49:30.520 --> 01:49:33.470
<v Speaker 5>that's so much.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A woman's Pussy CEO.</v>

2622
01:49:33.910 --> 01:49:38.910
<v Speaker 5>She had the woman's longest nails,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but this motherfucker's got the longest </v>

2623
01:49:38.910 --> 01:49:40.330
<v Speaker 5>nails in them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Shits are ridiculous.</v>

2624
01:49:40.360 --> 01:49:42.700
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a totally different animal.</v>

2625
01:49:42.701 --> 01:49:47.701
<v Speaker 5>I think that's more needier.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How much did you love to fucking just </v>

2626
01:49:47.701 --> 01:49:47.701
<v Speaker 5>acts those?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh</v>

2627

2628
01:49:48.960 --> 01:49:53.960
<v Speaker 10>Changed and I became so that pushed me </v>
<v Speaker 10>to keep my conviction,</v>

2629
01:49:59.940 --> 01:50:00.410
<v Speaker 10>snails,</v>

2630
01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:01.900
<v Speaker 1>alien,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nails.</v>

2631
01:50:02.580 --> 01:50:07.580
<v Speaker 1>She went what they taste like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got taped together.</v>

2633
01:50:11.300 --> 01:50:16.300
<v Speaker 1>A tape has gotten yellow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look how gross that is taped up and </v>

2634
01:50:17.491 --> 01:50:22.491
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It swings around in a big circle around </v>

2635
01:50:22.491 --> 01:50:24.781
<v Speaker 1>his thumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would not want to eat at this </v>

2636
01:50:24.781 --> 01:50:24.781
<v Speaker 1>restaurant now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey Kevin,</v>

01:50:24.781 --> 01:50:27.340
<v Speaker 1>the guy quit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking arm is worthless.</v>

2638
01:50:27.640 --> 01:50:32.640
<v Speaker 1>Useless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gave up use of his left arm just to </v>

2639
01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:33.530
<v Speaker 1>be a cool guy with the longest nails,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but who I.</v>

2640
01:50:33.780 --> 01:50:38.780
<v Speaker 1>This is white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That tell them that there's look </v>

2641
01:50:38.780 --> 01:50:38.780
<v Speaker 1>terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man.</v>

2642
01:50:38.780 --> 01:50:42.450
<v Speaker 1>In India people are different in </v>
<v Speaker 1>different parts of the world would have </v>

2643
01:50:42.450 --> 01:50:42.450
<v Speaker 1>been India.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the shit.</v>

2644
01:50:42.450 --> 01:50:45.990
<v Speaker 1>It's probably like a hoarder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably like a disease and mental </v>

2645
01:50:45.990 --> 01:50:45.990
<v Speaker 1>disease probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2646
01:50:45.990 --> 01:50:46.630
<v Speaker 1>You can have like a sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>accomplishment.</v>

2647
01:50:46.631 --> 01:50:51.631
<v Speaker 1>So there's one thing in your life that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know is normal or awesome or </v>

2648
01:50:51.631 --> 01:50:51.631
<v Speaker 1>something thing.</v>

2649
01:50:51.631 --> 01:50:52.420
<v Speaker 1>You're good at cutting your nails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a shitty thing.</v>

2650
01:50:52.421 --> 01:50:55.930
<v Speaker 1>It'd be so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that somehow or another there's</v>

2651
01:50:55.940 --> 01:51:00.940
<v Speaker 1>value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is because people are paying </v>

2652
01:51:00.940 --> 01:51:00.940
<v Speaker 1>attention to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2653
01:51:00.940 --> 01:51:01.460
<v Speaker 1>but not good attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People pay attention to Sandusky too,</v>

2654
01:51:01.461 --> 01:51:02.380
<v Speaker 1>but nothing like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

2655
01:51:02.381 --> 01:51:03.550
<v Speaker 1>Is it's bad reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2656
01:51:03.620 --> 01:51:05.020
<v Speaker 1>But they're not angry at him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

2657
01:51:05.021 --> 01:51:06.220
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to look at it.</v>

2658
01:51:06.430 --> 01:51:08.090
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's all he needs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2659
01:51:08.110 --> 01:51:10.060
<v Speaker 1>He just needs someone to want to stare </v>
<v Speaker 1>at them.</v>

2660
01:51:10.061 --> 01:51:11.930
<v Speaker 1>And just a reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2661
01:51:12.220 --> 01:51:13.840
<v Speaker 1>is it even positive?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like woo.</v>

2662
01:51:13.841 --> 01:51:15.760
<v Speaker 1>Like people look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they look at it and it's not,</v>

2663
01:51:15.860 --> 01:51:17.830
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's horrific for sure.</v>

2664
01:51:17.831 --> 01:51:20.110
<v Speaker 1>It's disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's also energetic.</v>

2665
01:51:20.111 --> 01:51:21.520
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh whoa.</v>

2666
01:51:21.730 --> 01:51:24.970
<v Speaker 1>To him it might be just that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just the fact that everywhere he goes,</v>

2667
01:51:25.750 --> 01:51:28.480
<v Speaker 1>there's no denying that he gets a </v>
<v Speaker 1>significant reaction,</v>

2668
01:51:28.720 --> 01:51:28.930
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2669
01:51:28.930 --> 01:51:31.230
<v Speaker 1>So that's enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it gives him like important.</v>

2670
01:51:31.231 --> 01:51:36.231
<v Speaker 1>So it gives them something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think he's a very uninteresting guy </v>

2671
01:51:36.231 --> 01:51:36.231
<v Speaker 1>and that's the one time people show </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest.</v>

2672
01:51:36.231 --> 01:51:37.930
<v Speaker 1>Like every story he Kelsey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but probably zone out.</v>

2673
01:51:37.931 --> 01:51:39.430
<v Speaker 1>He probably sees their eyes going up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the air.</v>

2674
01:51:39.431 --> 01:51:44.431
<v Speaker 1>He's probably a terrible bore it all he </v>
<v Speaker 1>talks about is fucking stupid nails all </v>

2675
01:51:44.920 --> 01:51:49.920
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think he segues every </v>

2676
01:51:49.920 --> 01:51:51.601
<v Speaker 1>conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tries to steer it back to his fucking </v>

2677
01:51:51.601 --> 01:51:51.601
<v Speaker 1>stupid left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His wife wants to talk about the news.</v>

2678
01:51:51.601 --> 01:51:53.890
<v Speaker 1>That is a guy in Pakistan who thinks he </v>
<v Speaker 1>can grow longer.</v>

2679
01:51:53.891 --> 01:51:56.050

<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>

2681
01:51:58.120 --> 01:52:03.120

<v Speaker 1>He thinks I would have quit and he just </v>

2682
01:52:03.120 --> 01:52:06.301
<v Speaker 1>gets mad when he hears about dudes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try and take his crown one if there's </v>

2683
01:52:06.301 --> 01:52:09.361
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an online giant nail community where </v>

2684
01:52:09.361 --> 01:52:09.361
<v Speaker 1>they can like check does.</v>

2685
01:52:09.361 --> 01:52:13.430

<v Speaker 1>would try to gain weight a purpose and </v>

2686
01:52:13.430 --> 01:52:16.210
<v Speaker 1>like taught like it was like sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bear thing and talk about a hot.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Their guts looked to end a relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's A.</v>

2688
01:52:22.020 --> 01:52:25.570
<v Speaker 1>Brian hates himself and do a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>sponge shape.</v>

2689
01:52:26.190 --> 01:52:29.780

<v Speaker 1>They break up with me.</v>

2690
01:52:31.690 --> 01:52:36.690
<v Speaker 1>I got a lot of weight to lose now guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a hilarious joke and should </v>

2691
01:52:36.690 --> 01:52:36.690
<v Speaker 1>talk about that on stage because it's so</v>
<v Speaker 1>funny.</v>

2692
01:52:36.690 --> 01:52:39.310
<v Speaker 1>And in his truck accident have you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should do it more often.</v>

2693
01:52:39.640 --> 01:52:41.680
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard to get like a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>pig man.</v>

2694
01:52:42.700 --> 01:52:43.870
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hit my body.</v>

2695
01:52:43.960 --> 01:52:46.190
<v Speaker 1>It's just where the speed alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just forget</v>

2696
01:52:46.190 --> 01:52:47.270
<v Speaker 6>to eat and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh shit,</v>

2697
01:52:47.271 --> 01:52:52.271
<v Speaker 6>I really need to eat because I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 6>gonna be able to eat for like five </v>

2698
01:52:52.271 --> 01:52:52.271
<v Speaker 6>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What do I have jack in the box.</v>

2699
01:52:52.271 --> 01:52:52.271
<v Speaker 6>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>

2700
01:52:52.271 --> 01:52:57.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the reasons I like being </v>

2701
01:52:57.250 --> 01:52:58.991
<v Speaker 1>home so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the favorite things is because I </v>

2702
01:52:58.991 --> 01:53:01.571
<v Speaker 1>can actually eat real food and control </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I eat and actually go to the </v>

2703
01:53:01.571 --> 01:53:02.930
<v Speaker 1>supermarket and having to eat at </v>
<v Speaker 1>restaurants all the time.</v>

2704
01:53:03.170 --> 01:53:08.170
<v Speaker 1>And plus the temptation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're hungry and you're out in </v>

2705
01:53:08.170 --> 01:53:10.781
<v Speaker 1>the road and you see a Wendy's double </v>
<v Speaker 1>cheeseburger pretty fucking good right </v>

2706
01:53:10.781 --> 01:53:11.630
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you work out so much.</v>

2707
01:53:11.690 --> 01:53:14.780
<v Speaker 1>I went out with you wanting to Austin </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we a fucking pancakes,</v>

2708
01:53:14.781 --> 01:53:17.240
<v Speaker 1>like you had a man's meal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to nibble on salmon,</v>

2709
01:53:17.241 --> 01:53:18.710
<v Speaker 1>like a fucking fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

2710
01:53:18.711 --> 01:53:19.520
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you do.</v>

2711
01:53:19.521 --> 01:53:21.250
<v Speaker 1>How many of you work out for so long?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can.</v>

2712
01:53:21.300 --> 01:53:23.660
<v Speaker 1>You can get away with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't let it,</v>

2713
01:53:23.710 --> 01:53:25.580
<v Speaker 1>let it get out of hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2714
01:53:25.610 --> 01:53:30.610
<v Speaker 1>you can only keep eating pancakes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit as long as you're actually eating </v>

2715
01:53:30.610 --> 01:53:32.480
<v Speaker 1>regular food on the most for the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>part,</v>

2716
01:53:32.630 --> 01:53:34.340
<v Speaker 1>like healthy food for the most part.</v>

2717
01:53:34.340 --> 01:53:37.460
<v Speaker 1>And then when that pancake comes up you </v>
<v Speaker 1>deserved that bitch go crazy.</v>

2718
01:53:37.520 --> 01:53:38.660
<v Speaker 1>How often do you give yourself that </v>
<v Speaker 1>cheat?</v>

2719
01:53:38.661 --> 01:53:40.220
<v Speaker 1>Like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every couple of days.</v>

2720
01:53:40.221 --> 01:53:42.410
<v Speaker 1>Every three or four days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try to do it every day,</v>

2721
01:53:42.411 --> 01:53:47.411
<v Speaker 1>but I don't restrict myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if one day I'm like at the coffee </v>

2722
01:53:47.411 --> 01:53:47.870
<v Speaker 1>shop and a coconut macaroon looks extra </v>
<v Speaker 1>delicious.</v>

2723
01:53:48.860 --> 01:53:50.690
<v Speaker 1>Coconut macaroon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How often you work out?</v>

2724
01:53:50.930 --> 01:53:52.680
<v Speaker 1>Almost every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just the.</v>

2725
01:53:52.700 --> 01:53:57.700
<v Speaker 1>The key is to just keep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I take at least one or two days off a </v>

2726

<v Speaker 6>first got to meet you that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that was so shocking to me.</v>

<v Speaker 6>time,</v>

2760
01:55:20.441 --> 01:55:24.850
<v Speaker 6>like talking about masturbating.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I never would talk about my masturbation</v>

<v Speaker 6>out the public to anybody,</v>

<v Speaker 6>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're all debating talking about it.</v>

2767
01:55:41.701 --> 01:55:41.860

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2773
01:55:52.830 --> 01:55:54.400

<v Speaker 1>one of the,</v>

2804
01:56:59.760 --> 01:57:04.760
<v Speaker 1>I think Jimmy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet you agree that one of the best </v>

2805
01:57:04.760 --> 01:57:07.701
<v Speaker 1>things about being a comic is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're friends with comics get to hang </v>

2806
01:57:07.701 --> 01:57:07.701
<v Speaker 1>out with comics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2807
01:57:07.701 --> 01:57:09.330
<v Speaker 1>like a guy like Colin or like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2808
01:57:09.360 --> 01:57:10.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jody is like,</v>

2809
01:57:11.240 --> 01:57:13.530

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2810
01:57:13.531 --> 01:57:18.531
<v Speaker 1>you get to hang out with people who were</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking really entertaining and fun to </v>

2811
01:57:18.531 --> 01:57:18.531
<v Speaker 1>be around all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2812
01:57:18.531 --> 01:57:19.720
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a really weird thing with comics.</v>

2813
01:57:19.720 --> 01:57:21.040
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do think my friends,</v>

2814
01:57:21.041 --> 01:57:26.041
<v Speaker 1>I'm friends with the funniest people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the country and I was on a plane going </v>

2815
01:57:26.041 --> 01:57:29.130
<v Speaker 1>back to New York and Seth Meyer was on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the plane and I didn't know.</v>

2816
01:57:29.131 --> 01:57:30.990
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know if it 100 percent him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never met him,</v>

2817
01:57:31.020 --> 01:57:36.020
<v Speaker 1>but I knew it was really weird cool </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling to know that at the end of the </v>

2818
01:57:36.020 --> 01:57:38.160
<v Speaker 1>flight to I think he's great and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to tell them that and I knew that</v>

2819
01:57:38.161 --> 01:57:43.161
<v Speaker 1>I could as a comic and I knew that he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he might not know a lot of what I've </v>

2820
01:57:43.161 --> 01:57:46.731
<v Speaker 1>done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I knew he would recognize my face </v>

2821
01:57:46.731 --> 01:57:46.731
<v Speaker 1>and I would be able to talk to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For them it was really weird,</v>

2822
01:57:46.731 --> 01:57:48.720
<v Speaker 1>like that's what it feels like to be an </v>
<v Speaker 1>accurate and see another actor.</v>

2823
01:57:48.920 --> 01:57:53.920
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm psyched whenever I fucking see </v>
<v Speaker 1>a comic I like and I know I can just go </v>

2824
01:57:53.920 --> 01:57:55.140
<v Speaker 1>up and say hello to them and even if </v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't know who I am,</v>

2825
01:57:55.380 --> 01:57:57.900
<v Speaker 1>if I say I'm a comic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Joan rivers when I met,</v>

2826
01:57:57.901 --> 01:58:00.450
<v Speaker 1>didn't know who I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when she found out I was a comic,</v>

2827
01:58:00.451 --> 01:58:03.240
<v Speaker 1>she had her road manager fucking passed </v>
<v Speaker 1>me a newspaper.</v>

2828
01:58:03.240 --> 01:58:03.720
<v Speaker 1>She like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2829
01:58:03.721 --> 01:58:08.721
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look like you need something to </v>

2830
01:58:08.721 --> 01:58:08.721
<v Speaker 1>read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was on the plate and doing nothing.</v>

2831
01:58:08.721 --> 01:58:08.721
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just a nice bond to have.</v>

2832
01:58:08.721 --> 01:58:09.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I love,</v>

2833
01:58:09.570 --> 01:58:11.730
<v Speaker 1>love being in front of the comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2834
01:58:11.731 --> 01:58:16.731
<v Speaker 1>it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially because I think both you and </v>

2835
01:58:16.731 --> 01:58:16.731
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2836
01:58:16.731 --> 01:58:20.091
<v Speaker 1>when we started out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would look at professional comedians </v>

2837
01:58:20.091 --> 01:58:20.250
<v Speaker 1>with such all in reverence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2838
01:58:20.251 --> 01:58:23.220
<v Speaker 1>the idea that one day you were going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually be a professional,</v>

2839
01:58:23.520 --> 01:58:24.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2840
01:58:24.070 --> 01:58:29.070
<v Speaker 1>you're a real comic and then now you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>to hang out with real comics and you're </v>

2841
01:58:29.070 --> 01:58:30.810
<v Speaker 1>actually like working with these people </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

2842
01:58:30.811 --> 01:58:35.811
<v Speaker 1>and they're like the people that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>admire when you were at or the idea of </v>

2843
01:58:35.811 --> 01:58:36.810
<v Speaker 1>the people that you admired when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were a kid,</v>

2844
01:58:36.811 --> 01:58:41.811
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to know that they respect you and </v>

2845
01:58:41.811 --> 01:58:41.811
<v Speaker 1>that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're welcome in the group.</v>

2846
01:58:41.811 --> 01:58:41.811
<v Speaker 1>It sounds</v>

2847
01:58:42.050 --> 01:58:47.050
<v Speaker 3>like as we always want to be accepted </v>
<v Speaker 3>and to know that you're not an outcast </v>

2848
01:58:47.050 --> 01:58:50.341
<v Speaker 3>comic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but his comments that some guys look at </v>

2849
01:58:50.341 --> 01:58:50.560
<v Speaker 3>it and you never want to be that guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's got to be awful.</v>

2850
01:58:50.680 --> 01:58:53.520
<v Speaker 3>But to know that other comics like me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2851
01:58:53.570 --> 01:58:55.570
<v Speaker 3>either they don't enjoy my act,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they liked me personally.</v>

2852
01:58:55.571 --> 01:59:00.571
<v Speaker 3>It's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a nice feeling and it's a feeling </v>

2853
01:59:00.571 --> 01:59:00.571
<v Speaker 3>of belonging,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is very important.</v>

2854
01:59:00.571 --> 01:59:04.681
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Humans like to be accepted when every </v>

2855
01:59:04.681 --> 01:59:07.831
<v Speaker 3>human wants to be accepted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the crazy thing about comedy is you </v>

2856
01:59:07.831 --> 01:59:10.360
<v Speaker 3>asking for acceptance for you going out </v>
<v Speaker 3>on crazy limbs.</v>

2857
01:59:10.570 --> 01:59:15.570
<v Speaker 3>I mean you're going out on a limb where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're standing on stage demanding </v>

2858
01:59:15.570 --> 01:59:16.690
<v Speaker 3>people's attention and trying to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>them react a certain way and laugh,</v>

2859
01:59:17.020 --> 01:59:20.560
<v Speaker 3>which is incredibly difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could never get a computer to figure</v>

2860
01:59:20.561 --> 01:59:21.130
<v Speaker 3>out how to do it.</v>

2861
01:59:21.490 --> 01:59:22.390
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's A.</v>

2862
01:59:22.390 --> 01:59:26.440
<v Speaker 3>There's nuances and subtleties to it </v>
<v Speaker 3>that really only exists organically.</v>

2863
01:59:26.560 --> 01:59:27.610
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they will.</v>

2864
01:59:27.611 --> 01:59:29.320
<v Speaker 3>They they with chess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was the same thing.</v>

2865
01:59:29.321 --> 01:59:32.200
<v Speaker 3>They got Kasparov and those are moves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those moves,</v>

2866
01:59:32.201 --> 01:59:33.910
<v Speaker 3>those are numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's a little to the left,</v>

2867
01:59:33.911 --> 01:59:34.740
<v Speaker 3>one of the right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2868
01:59:34.980 --> 01:59:39.980
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a big difference between that and </v>

2869
01:59:39.980 --> 01:59:39.980
<v Speaker 3>the idea of humor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might be able to get some humor.</v>

2870
01:59:39.980 --> 01:59:41.830
<v Speaker 3>You're never going to figure out Joey </v>
<v Speaker 3>Diaz on a computer.</v>

2871
01:59:42.550 --> 01:59:44.800
<v Speaker 3>What's funny is that he's really Joey </v>
<v Speaker 3>Diaz,</v>

2872
01:59:44.820 --> 01:59:46.720
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what's funny is that's the real</v>

2873
01:59:46.721 --> 01:59:48.370
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He really doesn't give a fuck.</v>

2874
01:59:48.371 --> 01:59:53.371
<v Speaker 3>You can suck his dick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He gets up at eight in the morning and </v>

2875
01:59:53.371 --> 01:59:53.371
<v Speaker 3>goes right to the puck and pot </v>
<v Speaker 3>dispensary.</v>

2876
01:59:53.371 --> 01:59:54.670
<v Speaker 3>Like a doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's.</v>

2877
01:59:54.690 --> 01:59:55.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>

2878
01:59:55.060 --> 01:59:56.660
<v Speaker 3>But you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he's a,</v>

2879
01:59:56.680 --> 01:59:58.390
<v Speaker 3>he's a real human,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2880
01:59:58.391 --> 01:59:59.140
<v Speaker 3>like you can't event,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2881
01:59:59.141 --> 02:00:00.190
<v Speaker 3>Patrice on a computer.</v>

2882
02:00:00.190 --> 02:00:01.990
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to figure it out.</v>

2883
02:00:02.380 --> 02:00:02.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a,</v>

2884
02:00:03.070 --> 02:00:08.070
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you tried alienware tried to </v>

2885
02:00:08.070 --> 02:00:08.980
<v Speaker 3>portray is funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck man.</v>

2886
02:00:09.010 --> 02:00:10.700
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was awesome man at any guys.</v>

2887
02:00:11.430 --> 02:00:13.250
<v Speaker 3>I don't give a fuck guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He and,</v>

2888
02:00:13.320 --> 02:00:15.310
<v Speaker 3>and he really again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another guy who just didn't.</v>

2889
02:00:15.380 --> 02:00:20.380
<v Speaker 3>I think at times he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he probably should have like when you </v>

2890
02:00:20.380 --> 02:00:20.380
<v Speaker 3>look back over history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like yeah,</v>

2891
02:00:20.380 --> 02:00:21.730
<v Speaker 3>he probably would've been farther along </v>
<v Speaker 3>if he had cared earlier on,</v>

2892
02:00:21.910 --> 02:00:23.950
<v Speaker 3>but the business finally couldn't ignore</v>
<v Speaker 3>them at the end.</v>

2893
02:00:23.951 --> 02:00:25.330
<v Speaker 3>Like after the shooting Roche,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Oh,</v>

2894
02:00:25.331 --> 02:00:28.210
<v Speaker 3>that's what this guy does and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't ignore it anymore.</v>

2895
02:00:28.211 --> 02:00:31.000
<v Speaker 3>And of course that's going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2896
02:00:31.001 --> 02:00:34.960
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's real hard for a lot of great comics</v>

2897
02:00:34.961 --> 02:00:36.830
<v Speaker 3>to figure out how to market themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2898
02:00:36.870 --> 02:00:41.870
<v Speaker 3>we all know guys like Nick Depaulo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's one of the fucking funniest guys </v>

2899
02:00:41.870 --> 02:00:41.870
<v Speaker 3>ever.</v>

2900
02:00:41.870 --> 02:00:43.390
<v Speaker 3>Unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Depaul's a great standup comedian.</v>

2901
02:00:43.600 --> 02:00:46.450
<v Speaker 3>I saw him again the last time I was in </v>
<v Speaker 3>New York.</v>

2902
02:00:47.080 --> 02:00:52.080
<v Speaker 3>I went by Caroline's just on a like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>random night and for whatever reason it </v>

2903
02:00:52.080 --> 02:00:53.190
<v Speaker 3>wasn't working.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2904
02:00:53.200 --> 02:00:54.490
<v Speaker 3>it was the night before I was supposed </v>
<v Speaker 3>to work.</v>

2905
02:00:54.491 --> 02:00:59.491
<v Speaker 3>That's what it was and I didn't know </v>
<v Speaker 3>that depaul was going to be there and </v>

2906
02:00:59.491 --> 02:01:01.670
<v Speaker 3>right before he got on stage I arrived.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I sat in the audience like,</v>

2907
02:01:01.750 --> 02:01:06.750
<v Speaker 3>like an like an audience member.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just sat and watched the entire set </v>

2908
02:01:06.750 --> 02:01:08.130
<v Speaker 3>and I was fucking crying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>crying.</v>

2909
02:01:08.140 --> 02:01:10.480
<v Speaker 3>That dude is funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's fucking brilliant.</v>

2910
02:01:10.540 --> 02:01:11.710
<v Speaker 3>He's so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's always writing,</v>

2911
02:01:12.030 --> 02:01:17.030
<v Speaker 3>doing something about the Katrina </v>
<v Speaker 3>victims not getting rescued because they</v>

2912
02:01:17.111 --> 02:01:20.290
<v Speaker 3>couldn't spell help.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Said Hep,</v>

2913
02:01:20.350 --> 02:01:22.810
<v Speaker 3>you want to have your fucking fingers in</v>
<v Speaker 3>that water.</v>

2914
02:01:27.580 --> 02:01:32.580
<v Speaker 3>You want some happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dip your fingers in the water and it's </v>

2915
02:01:32.580 --> 02:01:35.671
<v Speaker 3>not just a personalized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The tagline is fucking is equally </v>

2916
02:01:35.671 --> 02:01:37.930
<v Speaker 3>brilliant and punchline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just so mean and so,</v>

2917
02:01:38.050 --> 02:01:40.820
<v Speaker 3>so like fucking Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2918
02:01:40.821 --> 02:01:43.100
<v Speaker 3>there's that certain style of comedy </v>
<v Speaker 3>that again,</v>

2919
02:01:43.820 --> 02:01:46.910
<v Speaker 3>people would protest for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of shit that depaulo would</v>

2920
02:01:46.911 --> 02:01:49.790
<v Speaker 3>say that people would get mad at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's funny to watch the funny.</v>

2921
02:01:49.850 --> 02:01:52.130
<v Speaker 3>It's funny to watch him at the cellar </v>
<v Speaker 3>when they get upset because he,</v>

2922
02:01:52.131 --> 02:01:55.880
<v Speaker 3>nick has no fucking fuse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He immediately gets annoyed at them when</v>

2923
02:01:55.881 --> 02:01:57.650
<v Speaker 3>they grown you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the seller,</v>

2924
02:01:57.710 --> 02:01:59.560
<v Speaker 3>like more sensitive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2926
02:02:00.510 --> 02:02:02.480
<v Speaker 3>they don't know who they're walking in </v>
<v Speaker 3>to see.</v>

2927
02:02:02.660 --> 02:02:06.200
<v Speaker 3>A lot of them are tourists and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>Nicole go on and sometimes she'll say to</v>

2928
02:02:06.201 --> 02:02:11.201
<v Speaker 3>them as genuinely harsh like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in the back on the UHF and like one </v>

2929
02:02:11.201 --> 02:02:11.201
<v Speaker 3>girl in the frog.</v>

2930
02:02:11.201 --> 02:02:11.770
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

2932
02:02:16.850 --> 02:02:19.211
<v Speaker 3>entire room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just love the fact that he has no </v>

2933
02:02:19.211 --> 02:02:20.870
<v Speaker 3>patience for the objection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen Nick Depaulo get mad at people</v>

2934
02:02:20.871 --> 02:02:25.871
<v Speaker 3>from crossing their arms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's fucking guy crossing his arms </v>

2935
02:02:25.871 --> 02:02:25.871
<v Speaker 3>looking at me here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

2938
02:02:30.530 --> 02:02:35.530
<v Speaker 3>But a guy like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even like to watch because he's </v>

2939
02:02:35.530 --> 02:02:36.440
<v Speaker 3>such a good comic and he's so funny and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be as good as that guy.</v>

2940
02:02:37.160 --> 02:02:39.830
<v Speaker 3>All I do is measure myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tell I'm on the road with,</v>

2941
02:02:40.420 --> 02:02:43.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing gigs with rd and nick and tell</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're doing these gigs together,</v>

2942
02:02:43.791 --> 02:02:45.210
<v Speaker 3>the four of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>

2943
02:02:45.270 --> 02:02:48.650
<v Speaker 3>it's uncomfortable to watch a towel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like he's so brilliant.</v>

2944
02:02:48.651 --> 02:02:50.540
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why don't you just enjoy it?</v>

2945
02:02:50.570 --> 02:02:51.590
<v Speaker 3>Can you just enjoy it?</v>

2946
02:02:52.010 --> 02:02:53.570
<v Speaker 3>I probably should.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2947
02:02:53.571 --> 02:02:54.860
<v Speaker 3>you're probably right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can do it.</v>

2948
02:02:55.190 --> 02:02:56.240
<v Speaker 3>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2949
02:02:56.241 --> 02:02:57.530
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to think the same way.</v>

2950
02:02:57.590 --> 02:02:58.670
<v Speaker 3>I used to think like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

2951
02:02:58.730 --> 02:03:03.730
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to not want to watch somebody </v>

2952
02:03:03.730 --> 02:03:03.730
<v Speaker 3>because then I would bomb if I went on </v>
<v Speaker 3>after them because I'd be thinking about</v>

2953
02:03:03.730 --> 02:03:06.410
<v Speaker 3>their assets and judging my own act and </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying fuck,</v>

2954
02:03:06.411 --> 02:03:11.411
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to say I suck at this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then somewhere along the line I </v>

2955
02:03:11.411 --> 02:03:15.311
<v Speaker 3>learned how to just laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I learned how to just watch comedy and </v>

2956
02:03:15.311 --> 02:03:16.190
<v Speaker 3>just enjoy it and not worry about like </v>
<v Speaker 3>my own shit.</v>

2957
02:03:16.400 --> 02:03:18.620
<v Speaker 3>And just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no it work before,</v>

2958
02:03:18.621 --> 02:03:18.980
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2959
02:03:18.981 --> 02:03:21.290
<v Speaker 3>don't be so attached to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but don't,</v>

2960
02:03:21.470 --> 02:03:23.990
<v Speaker 3>don't worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just just do the work,</v>

2961
02:03:24.110 --> 02:03:27.350
<v Speaker 3>do the work that it takes to create an </v>
<v Speaker 3>act that's good enough so you don't have</v>

2962
02:03:27.351 --> 02:03:29.360
<v Speaker 3>to worry about it and then enjoy it.</v>

2963
02:03:29.600 --> 02:03:33.890
<v Speaker 3>So like when I go on the road and I take</v>
<v Speaker 3>it with me or Duncan or Joey Diaz,</v>

2964
02:03:34.100 --> 02:03:39.100
<v Speaker 3>I like watching.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like standing on the sidelines and </v>

2965
02:03:39.100 --> 02:03:39.470
<v Speaker 3>watching Joey Diaz.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like howling with laughter.</v>

2966
02:03:39.620 --> 02:03:42.440
<v Speaker 3>It's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think holy shit,</v>

2967
02:03:42.441 --> 02:03:43.900
<v Speaker 3>he's killing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go on right next.</v>

2968
02:03:43.910 --> 02:03:46.460
<v Speaker 3>I never think that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think this is awesome.</v>

2969
02:03:46.490 --> 02:03:51.490
<v Speaker 3>This is fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I want to watch a guy who's </v>

2970
02:03:51.490 --> 02:03:52.340
<v Speaker 3>hilarious is making me laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2971
02:03:52.341 --> 02:03:54.980
<v Speaker 3>I think that was just a shift in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness.</v>

2972
02:03:54.981 --> 02:03:56.660
<v Speaker 3>I just had to kind of understand things </v>
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>

2973
02:03:56.661 --> 02:03:58.760
<v Speaker 3>I didn't get get older,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2974
02:03:59.300 --> 02:04:02.510
<v Speaker 3>And once I figured that out it changed </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way I looked at comedy.</v>

2975
02:04:02.840 --> 02:04:04.790
<v Speaker 3>It's funny man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so hard to do that.</v>

2976
02:04:04.791 --> 02:04:05.330
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2977
02:04:05.331 --> 02:04:10.331
<v Speaker 3>you get so quick like I used to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it used to be I had to feel negative </v>

2978
02:04:10.331 --> 02:04:10.980
<v Speaker 3>before I went on and I had to feel like </v>
<v Speaker 3>I suck and I'm not going to do.</v>

2979
02:04:11.050 --> 02:04:13.670
<v Speaker 3>I was almost lowering all expectations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if I bomb,</v>

2980
02:04:13.671 --> 02:04:15.710
<v Speaker 3>I kind of knew.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I don't do that and I kind of assume</v>

2981
02:04:15.711 --> 02:04:16.880
<v Speaker 3>a guy will be good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2982
02:04:16.881 --> 02:04:21.881
<v Speaker 3>you've been around long enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How bad does it feel when you go </v>

2983
02:04:21.881 --> 02:04:21.881
<v Speaker 3>onstage?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cocky,</v>

2984
02:04:21.881 --> 02:04:25.130
<v Speaker 3>and I've done this before and I've seen </v>
<v Speaker 3>people do it before and you eat it,</v>

2985
02:04:25.700 --> 02:04:26.740
<v Speaker 3>you go onstage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cocky,</v>

2986
02:04:26.750 --> 02:04:28.400
<v Speaker 3>you don't ingratiate yourself somehow or</v>
<v Speaker 3>another,</v>

2987
02:04:28.401 --> 02:04:31.030
<v Speaker 3>you miss the connection initially with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the audience and then you're,</v>

2988
02:04:31.031 --> 02:04:33.790
<v Speaker 3>you're already running on borrowed time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

2989
02:04:33.820 --> 02:04:38.820
<v Speaker 3>Then you fucking feel like you can't get</v>
<v Speaker 3>any traction and then you're forcing </v>

2990
02:04:38.820 --> 02:04:38.820
<v Speaker 3>bits and like we were</v>

2991
02:04:38.820 --> 02:04:43.010
<v Speaker 5>talking about earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like over a motion and so gross that </v>

2992
02:04:43.010 --> 02:04:44.120
<v Speaker 5>when you just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you didn't approach the,</v>

2993
02:04:44.121 --> 02:04:45.870
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the thing with enough fear.</v>

2994
02:04:46.200 --> 02:04:48.210
<v Speaker 5>You didn't approach it with enough </v>
<v Speaker 5>reverence.</v>

2995
02:04:48.270 --> 02:04:49.410
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've got cocky,</v>

2996
02:04:49.411 --> 02:04:50.340
<v Speaker 5>you thought you're just going to be able</v>
<v Speaker 5>to.</v>

2997
02:04:50.430 --> 02:04:55.430
<v Speaker 5>I've seen Joey Diaz do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've seen him have bad sets because of </v>

2998
02:04:55.430 --> 02:04:55.430
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just,</v>

2999
02:04:55.430 --> 02:04:55.590
<v Speaker 5>it's one of those things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3000
02:04:55.830 --> 02:05:00.830
<v Speaker 5>I think we all do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I think we all go through when </v>

3001
02:05:00.830 --> 02:05:00.830
<v Speaker 5>you go up and you just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm in a fucking hammer,</v>

3002
02:05:00.830 --> 02:05:04.611
<v Speaker 5>these people and then you go up and then</v>
<v Speaker 5>once you miss the connection it's </v>

3003
02:05:04.611 --> 02:05:08.601
<v Speaker 5>usually you can salvage something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I was worried tonight when I went </v>

3004
02:05:08.601 --> 02:05:10.380
<v Speaker 5>out and I sat on panel because the first</v>
<v Speaker 5>couple of jokes were like,</v>

3005
02:05:10.440 --> 02:05:15.440
<v Speaker 5>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well you had 14 year old girls in the </v>

3006
02:05:15.440 --> 02:05:15.440
<v Speaker 5>audience though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That scared me because I'm like,</v>

3007
02:05:15.440 --> 02:05:16.230
<v Speaker 5>this is a fucking pig show.</v>

3008
02:05:16.230 --> 02:05:21.230
<v Speaker 5>You fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then you start all those years of </v>

3009
02:05:21.230 --> 02:05:21.230
<v Speaker 5>doing gigs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You start reaching for like,</v>

3010
02:05:21.230 --> 02:05:26.001
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how to manipulate your act and your set </v>

3011
02:05:26.001 --> 02:05:26.001
<v Speaker 5>and what are you doing to kind of make </v>
<v Speaker 5>it work?</v>

3012
02:05:26.001 --> 02:05:30.861
<v Speaker 5>And I knew where to go where I could get</v>
<v Speaker 5>a laugh and it was like I did that </v>

3013
02:05:30.861 --> 02:05:34.850
<v Speaker 5>totally playing to these people in this </v>
<v Speaker 5>audience and not to the millions of </v>

3014
02:05:35.310 --> 02:05:38.310
<v Speaker 5>people around the world that we're </v>
<v Speaker 5>listening to you.</v>

3015
02:05:38.340 --> 02:05:40.080
<v Speaker 5>While I was doing stuff that I wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 5>do anyway,</v>

3016
02:05:40.081 --> 02:05:45.081
<v Speaker 5>but I cut certain things and winter in a</v>
<v Speaker 5>different order because even though I'm </v>

3017
02:05:45.081 --> 02:05:49.221
<v Speaker 5>talking to the people at home,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you want the people at home to see you </v>

3018
02:05:49.221 --> 02:05:49.950
<v Speaker 5>doing well because even though they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to laugh with her and laugh at it,</v>

3019
02:05:49.951 --> 02:05:52.250
<v Speaker 5>if they see you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't want to bomb on a shelf.</v>

3020
02:05:52.270 --> 02:05:54.030
<v Speaker 5>That'd be hard,</v>
<v Speaker 5>stank.</v>

3021
02:05:54.330 --> 02:05:59.330
<v Speaker 5>Even if the jokes were good,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the evidence proves that they weren't </v>

3022
02:05:59.330 --> 02:05:59.330
<v Speaker 5>good right here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I laughed at home.</v>

3023
02:05:59.330 --> 02:06:04.190
<v Speaker 5>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These people in the audience didn't </v>

3024
02:06:04.190 --> 02:06:04.190
<v Speaker 5>laugh at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3025
02:06:04.190 --> 02:06:04.200
<v Speaker 5>It was uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like they just going to be uncomfortable</v>

3026
02:06:04.201 --> 02:06:05.700
<v Speaker 5>for you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't mean no.</v>

3027
02:06:05.701 --> 02:06:10.701
<v Speaker 5>This is a big shot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Especially since you have this history </v>

3028
02:06:10.701 --> 02:06:13.971
<v Speaker 5>of talking about all of your perversions</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then here you are in front of 14 </v>

3029
02:06:13.971 --> 02:06:16.860
<v Speaker 5>year old girls.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just about anything that's on your mind.</v>

3030
02:06:17.130 --> 02:06:20.910
<v Speaker 5>Whatever bit you were about to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I how many you would never have expected</v>

3031
02:06:20.911 --> 02:06:22.590
<v Speaker 5>that would have been your crowd before </v>
<v Speaker 5>you got there,</v>

3032
02:06:22.591 --> 02:06:23.040
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3033
02:06:23.041 --> 02:06:28.041
<v Speaker 5>I knew it because they told me that I </v>
<v Speaker 5>was posted to this Friday with a WHO's </v>

3034
02:06:28.041 --> 02:06:28.920
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Andrew Garfield is playing spiderman.</v>

3035
02:06:28.921 --> 02:06:32.200
<v Speaker 5>I was going to be on the couch with him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which would have been perfectly similar,</v>

3036
02:06:32.230 --> 02:06:33.330
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>audience,</v>

3037
02:06:33.331 --> 02:06:35.550
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure that demo and what I'm looking </v>
<v Speaker 5>for.</v>

3038
02:06:36.090 --> 02:06:36.840
<v Speaker 5>But then they said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

3039
02:06:36.841 --> 02:06:38.350
<v Speaker 5>because of the finals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything's good.</v>

3040
02:06:38.351 --> 02:06:43.351
<v Speaker 5>We want to put you on Wednesday,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is a much bigger shell because </v>

3041
02:06:43.351 --> 02:06:43.351
<v Speaker 5>it's the middle of the week and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>

3042
02:06:43.351 --> 02:06:44.010
<v Speaker 5>Justin Bieber's on it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>

3043
02:06:44.040 --> 02:06:45.110
<v Speaker 5>ugh.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

3044
02:06:45.120 --> 02:06:50.120
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I almost didn't want to do it because I </v>

3045
02:06:50.120 --> 02:06:50.120
<v Speaker 5>realized the size of the show is </v>
<v Speaker 5>different,</v>

3046
02:06:50.120 --> 02:06:51.840
<v Speaker 5>but I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to eat my fucking balls and</v>

3047
02:06:52.380 --> 02:06:54.330
<v Speaker 5>you'll be fine and faith in you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

3048
02:06:54.390 --> 02:06:55.260
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and again,</v>

3049
02:06:55.261 --> 02:06:56.800
<v Speaker 5>I pulled it out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But um,</v>

3050
02:06:57.090 --> 02:06:59.370
<v Speaker 5>it could've been a disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was a disaster waiting to happen.</v>

3051
02:06:59.371 --> 02:07:02.730
<v Speaker 5>That was such a shit audience for your </v>
<v Speaker 5>sense of humor.</v>

3052
02:07:02.731 --> 02:07:05.090
<v Speaker 5>You have a perverted sense of humor and </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's all.</v>

3053
02:07:05.100 --> 02:07:06.230
<v Speaker 5>A lot of it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3054
02:07:06.240 --> 02:07:08.370
<v Speaker 5>even the clean stuff is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people know,</v>

3055
02:07:08.371 --> 02:07:10.020
<v Speaker 5>like there's always this wink,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wink,</v>

3056
02:07:10.021 --> 02:07:15.021
<v Speaker 5>hint,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hint that you're a perv now under the </v>

3057
02:07:15.021 --> 02:07:17.331
<v Speaker 5>surface of it all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they didn't know what the happy ending </v>

3058
02:07:17.331 --> 02:07:17.331
<v Speaker 5>was.</v>

3059
02:07:17.331 --> 02:07:17.331
<v Speaker 5>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was a happy ending.</v>

3060
02:07:17.331 --> 02:07:17.331
<v Speaker 5>The jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3061
02:07:17.331 --> 02:07:20.370
<v Speaker 5>it was a happy ending in the end that I </v>
<v Speaker 5>did it and you let destroys in clubs,</v>

3062
02:07:20.371 --> 02:07:21.230
<v Speaker 5>but they were all like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Huh,</v>

3063

<v Speaker 5>why would he do what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

3064
02:07:22.351 --> 02:07:25.390
<v Speaker 5>Oh fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I almost started tugging my tie.</v>

3065
02:07:25.900 --> 02:07:27.120
<v Speaker 5>No respect.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3066
02:07:27.180 --> 02:07:31.980
<v Speaker 5>it was fucking panicking man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And my heart to think about like playing</v>

3067
02:07:31.981 --> 02:07:36.981
<v Speaker 5>to the people at home that must've been </v>
<v Speaker 5>able to realize that you were in front </v>

3068
02:07:36.981 --> 02:07:37.360
<v Speaker 5>of some 14 year old girls,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like especially your fans.</v>

3069
02:07:37.390 --> 02:07:38.560
<v Speaker 5>I did,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I,</v>

3070
02:07:38.561 --> 02:07:42.250
<v Speaker 5>I again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wanted to do decent because again,</v>

3071
02:07:42.251 --> 02:07:47.251
<v Speaker 5>Mila Kunis is on the couch next to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like I don't want to bomb in front </v>

3072
02:07:47.251 --> 02:07:47.251
<v Speaker 5>of this fucking left.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She was great by the way.</v>

3073
02:07:47.500 --> 02:07:49.180
<v Speaker 5>He was really fucking cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3074
02:07:49.181 --> 02:07:50.570
<v Speaker 5>she was very nice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

3075
02:07:50.860 --> 02:07:55.860
<v Speaker 5>it helps when somebody on the couch kind</v>
<v Speaker 5>of with you laugh a little in the </v>

3076
02:07:55.901 --> 02:07:56.530
<v Speaker 5>background.</v>

3077
02:07:56.590 --> 02:08:01.590
<v Speaker 5>I did panel on time with Bill Maher and </v>
<v Speaker 5>I was not supposed to do with another </v>

3078
02:08:01.590 --> 02:08:02.350
<v Speaker 5>comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the lead guest canceled so they just</v>

3079
02:08:02.351 --> 02:08:06.040
<v Speaker 5>got more last minute that they never put</v>
<v Speaker 5>to stand up on a panel and they told me,</v>

3080
02:08:06.041 --> 02:08:11.041
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>certain things you are going to talk </v>

3081
02:08:11.041 --> 02:08:11.041
<v Speaker 5>about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is like Darren Mccain,</v>

3082
02:08:11.041 --> 02:08:11.041
<v Speaker 5>Obama running bill's going to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

3083
02:08:11.041 --> 02:08:15.720
<v Speaker 5>So I had to switch my set and a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But bill was surprisingly supportive on </v>

3084
02:08:15.720 --> 02:08:20.521
<v Speaker 5>panel,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which really fucking helped a lot </v>

3085
02:08:20.521 --> 02:08:20.521
<v Speaker 5>because that could have been a </v>
<v Speaker 5>disastrous situation.</v>

3086
02:08:20.521 --> 02:08:22.480
<v Speaker 5>I found out when I was in the store </v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to buy a t shirt an hour before I</v>

3087
02:08:22.481 --> 02:08:23.650
<v Speaker 5>had to go over to NBC.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

3088
02:08:23.651 --> 02:08:28.651
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we've got some new bill Maher is going </v>

3089
02:08:28.651 --> 02:08:28.651
<v Speaker 5>to be and how you're going to have to </v>
<v Speaker 5>change what you.</v>

3090
02:08:28.651 --> 02:08:32.580
<v Speaker 5>So wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you were on your way over there and </v>

3091
02:08:32.580 --> 02:08:32.580
<v Speaker 5>what bits did you have to do that?</v>

3092
02:08:32.580 --> 02:08:33.460
<v Speaker 5>We're with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I forget what I was talking about,</v>

3093
02:08:33.461 --> 02:08:38.461
<v Speaker 5>but it was something about Obama and </v>
<v Speaker 5>Mccain who was in like October or </v>

3094
02:08:38.461 --> 02:08:42.901
<v Speaker 5>whatever of Oh eight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is the last time I've done panels </v>

3095
02:08:42.901 --> 02:08:45.691
<v Speaker 5>because after that it was the Jay Leno </v>
<v Speaker 5>show and then all these bits I was </v>

3096
02:08:45.691 --> 02:08:45.691
<v Speaker 5>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it will be kind of interesting to see</v>

3097
02:08:45.691 --> 02:08:47.290
<v Speaker 5>your take after his take,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

3098
02:08:47.620 --> 02:08:49.330
<v Speaker 5>I mean as long as you're not doing the </v>
<v Speaker 5>same jokes,</v>

3099
02:08:49.331 --> 02:08:50.180
<v Speaker 5>what do you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

3100
02:08:50.181 --> 02:08:51.850
<v Speaker 5>Why,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why aren't you allowed to.</v>

3101
02:08:52.050 --> 02:08:53.260
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I probably could have,</v>

3102
02:08:53.261 --> 02:08:55.330
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember what their,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think they said Donald,</v>

3103
02:08:55.331 --> 02:08:56.980
<v Speaker 5>but they might've said you might want to</v>
<v Speaker 5>rethink it.</v>

3104
02:08:57.340 --> 02:08:58.060
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3105
02:08:58.061 --> 02:09:00.170
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>again to them to what is it at the,</v>

3106
02:09:00.540 --> 02:09:01.060
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3107
02:09:01.080 --> 02:09:03.490
<v Speaker 5>that expect to comics to go up and both </v>
<v Speaker 5>of them.</v>

3108
02:09:03.491 --> 02:09:06.520
<v Speaker 5>Do you know McCain Obama jokes?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3109
02:09:06.610 --> 02:09:09.790
<v Speaker 5>Know they probably wanted to switch and </v>
<v Speaker 5>just in tempo or tone,</v>

3110
02:09:10.240 --> 02:09:15.240
<v Speaker 5>two guys up there talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 5>exact same thing they might've felt it </v>

3111
02:09:15.240 --> 02:09:15.240
<v Speaker 5>would have been bad for me.</v>

3112
02:09:15.240 --> 02:09:15.790
<v Speaker 5>So what did you switch to this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember.</v>

3113
02:09:15.791 --> 02:09:17.990
<v Speaker 5>I never watched a set when I'm feeling </v>
<v Speaker 5>like I won't watch tonight.</v>

3114
02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:23.000
<v Speaker 5>I mean I'll check it on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's hope it's a fucking good one </v>

3115
02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:23.510
<v Speaker 5>because I'll never say it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just make sure I do that after fights.</v>

3116
02:09:23.550 --> 02:09:26.320
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes I check to see if anybody says</v>
<v Speaker 5>I suck cocker.</v>

3117
02:09:26.410 --> 02:09:27.500
<v Speaker 5>Who would say that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Honestly,</v>

3118
02:09:27.501 --> 02:09:32.501
<v Speaker 5>do a bunch of dudes that are haters make</v>
<v Speaker 5>a mistake or miss something in a replay </v>

3119
02:09:33.371 --> 02:09:34.390
<v Speaker 5>or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

3120
02:09:34.440 --> 02:09:39.440
<v Speaker 5>You never know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People find something to be upset about </v>

3121
02:09:39.440 --> 02:09:39.440
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm always amazed when you see because I</v>

3122
02:09:39.440 --> 02:09:42.910
<v Speaker 5>watched the UFC the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I love it so much,</v>

3123
02:09:42.911 --> 02:09:44.210
<v Speaker 5>but I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't just.</v>

3124
02:09:44.440 --> 02:09:49.440
<v Speaker 5>I can't see what they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but when you go into like you better </v>

3125
02:09:49.440 --> 02:09:49.930
<v Speaker 5>watch that right hand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it was Henderson.</v>

3126
02:09:50.230 --> 02:09:55.230
<v Speaker 5>Bisping was the best example that I ever</v>
<v Speaker 5>saw a when I at my advisor damage to </v>

3127
02:09:55.491 --> 02:09:56.080
<v Speaker 5>knock it out basically.</v>

3128
02:09:56.080 --> 02:09:57.920
<v Speaker 5>I think you were saying he's going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>walk right into his right.</v>

3129
02:09:58.720 --> 02:10:02.520
<v Speaker 5>Well it was really a classic mistake </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you do with a big puncher.</v>

3130
02:10:02.530 --> 02:10:07.530
<v Speaker 5>You move towards his power punch should </v>
<v Speaker 5>never do that because you kind of </v>

3131
02:10:07.530 --> 02:10:07.720
<v Speaker 5>accentuate the punch if you're running </v>
<v Speaker 5>away,</v>

3132
02:10:07.721 --> 02:10:12.721
<v Speaker 5>like especially if you kind of running </v>
<v Speaker 5>circular most of the time when you're </v>

3133
02:10:12.721 --> 02:10:12.721
<v Speaker 5>running away,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not really running straight back.</v>

3134
02:10:12.721 --> 02:10:17.221
<v Speaker 5>You're running side to side and this </v>
<v Speaker 5>bank continued to run towards Dan </v>

3135
02:10:17.221 --> 02:10:19.000
<v Speaker 5>Henderson's right side.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was running towards his left,</v>

3136
02:10:19.240 --> 02:10:24.240
<v Speaker 5>so in fact he's actually accentuating </v>
<v Speaker 5>the punch is running into the power of </v>

3137
02:10:24.240 --> 02:10:26.080
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so all Henderson has to do his time,</v>

3138
02:10:26.081 --> 02:10:28.180
<v Speaker 5>his move,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because it keeps going that way.</v>

3139
02:10:28.181 --> 02:10:29.530
<v Speaker 5>It's like he keeps giving it up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's not.</v>

3140
02:10:29.790 --> 02:10:34.790
<v Speaker 5>Frankie Edgar will go left and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>he'll go right now go left like Clay </v>

3141
02:10:34.790 --> 02:10:34.790
<v Speaker 5>Guido,</v>

3142
02:10:34.790 --> 02:10:39.130
<v Speaker 3>just fog gray maynard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people thought that it was a </v>

3143
02:10:39.130 --> 02:10:39.500
<v Speaker 3>boring fight because you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It went five rounds and quita had a hard</v>

3144
02:10:39.501 --> 02:10:44.501
<v Speaker 3>time engaging them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the bottom line is his movement is </v>

3145
02:10:44.501 --> 02:10:47.120
<v Speaker 3>what allowed him to stay safe because </v>
<v Speaker 3>that gray maynard is a fucking murderous</v>

3146
02:10:47.121 --> 02:10:50.420
<v Speaker 3>puncher that punches really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it he.</v>

3147
02:10:50.540 --> 02:10:55.540
<v Speaker 3>He played a smart footwork strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whether or not you liked the fight or </v>

3148
02:10:55.540 --> 02:10:56.030
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for his safety,</v>

3149
02:10:56.420 --> 02:10:59.330
<v Speaker 3>his movement was excellent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but bisping wasn't doing that.</v>

3150
02:10:59.331 --> 02:11:02.450
<v Speaker 3>This bank had made an error and kept </v>
<v Speaker 3>moving in the same direction.</v>

3151
02:11:02.600 --> 02:11:07.600
<v Speaker 3>And Dan Henderson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew it was going to time that and </v>

3152
02:11:07.600 --> 02:11:07.600
<v Speaker 3>when it did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like one of the greatest chaos in</v>

3153
02:11:07.600 --> 02:11:12.371
<v Speaker 3>like the history of the sport.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was one of the best one punch </v>

3154
02:11:12.371 --> 02:11:14.660
<v Speaker 3>knockout ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the followup followup was ruthless.</v>

3155
02:11:14.840 --> 02:11:15.610
<v Speaker 3>What do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3156
02:11:15.650 --> 02:11:18.500
<v Speaker 3>what he's going to fight Jon Jones </v>
<v Speaker 3>September for Henderson is.</v>

3157
02:11:18.530 --> 02:11:19.780
<v Speaker 3>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

3158
02:11:19.910 --> 02:11:20.840
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There Jones about that.</v>

3159
02:11:20.841 --> 02:11:22.340
<v Speaker 3>We'll interview them and you seem kind </v>
<v Speaker 3>of a.</v>

3160
02:11:22.550 --> 02:11:23.060
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

3161
02:11:23.061 --> 02:11:25.250
<v Speaker 3>if I can't be the guy in his forties and</v>
<v Speaker 3>a contact sport.</v>

3162
02:11:25.280 --> 02:11:26.990
<v Speaker 3>And that was his take on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What he really said.</v>

3163
02:11:27.020 --> 02:11:28.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said something about that.</v>

3164
02:11:28.461 --> 02:11:28.980
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on man.</v>

3165
02:11:29.010 --> 02:11:30.370
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3166
02:11:30.380 --> 02:11:31.670
<v Speaker 3>he's so confident.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3167
02:11:31.940 --> 02:11:34.280
<v Speaker 3>you think about what the guy's done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go through Shogun.</v>

3168
02:11:34.281 --> 02:11:36.350
<v Speaker 3>Go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me go through Machida.</v>

3169
02:11:36.380 --> 02:11:39.380
<v Speaker 3>Choke them unconscious and drop it in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way he,</v>

3170
02:11:39.381 --> 02:11:40.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you beat rampage.</v>

3171
02:11:40.611 --> 02:11:45.611
<v Speaker 3>Went to rampage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Choked rampage mean that's the rampage </v>

3172
02:11:45.611 --> 02:11:46.130
<v Speaker 3>is a tough motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3173
02:11:46.400 --> 02:11:48.530
<v Speaker 3>John Jones is putting away some tough </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys.</v>

3174
02:11:48.710 --> 02:11:51.300
<v Speaker 3>Rashad Evans is a bad motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Big decisions.</v>

3175
02:11:51.301 --> 02:11:53.470
<v Speaker 3>Rashad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know Rashad got a tough game.</v>

3176
02:11:53.690 --> 02:11:58.690
<v Speaker 3>I think a bit of a tougher time though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they went to or five rounds and </v>

3177
02:11:58.690 --> 02:11:58.690
<v Speaker 3>he couldn't.</v>

3178
02:11:58.690 --> 02:11:58.750
<v Speaker 3>He couldn't knock him out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need A.</v>

3179
02:11:59.330 --> 02:12:01.130
<v Speaker 3>I think he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think John's won all five rounds.</v>

3180
02:12:01.160 --> 02:12:05.060
<v Speaker 3>Well you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jones is bigger guy and Jones definitely</v>

3181
02:12:05.240 --> 02:12:08.900
<v Speaker 3>landed more shots and definitely forced </v>
<v Speaker 3>his game on Rashad,</v>

3182
02:12:08.901 --> 02:12:10.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were shot.</v>

3183
02:12:10.130 --> 02:12:15.130
<v Speaker 3>I think at one point in time when they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were training together was probably </v>

3184
02:12:15.130 --> 02:12:19.151
<v Speaker 3>better than Jon Jones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when a guy like Jon Jones comes </v>

3185
02:12:19.151 --> 02:12:19.151
<v Speaker 3>along,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like you,</v>

3186
02:12:19.151 --> 02:12:21.290
<v Speaker 3>you miss him for a month and then you </v>
<v Speaker 3>come back and you see them a month later</v>

3187
02:12:21.291 --> 02:12:22.730
<v Speaker 3>and you won't look.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm at the gym.</v>

3188
02:12:22.880 --> 02:12:25.260
<v Speaker 3>You look at him at the gym and he's like</v>
<v Speaker 3>15 percent pet.</v>

3189
02:12:25.550 --> 02:12:28.460
<v Speaker 3>Like this guy got 15 percent better in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>month and I'm not exaggerating.</v>

3190
02:12:28.670 --> 02:12:33.670
<v Speaker 3>There's certain dudes that just have </v>
<v Speaker 3>like an unbelievable ability to absorb </v>

3191
02:12:35.030 --> 02:12:39.230
<v Speaker 3>moves and then recreate them in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in real time situations.</v>

3192
02:12:39.470 --> 02:12:44.470
<v Speaker 3>Like you could teach certain guys </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu techniques and then they could </v>

3193
02:12:44.470 --> 02:12:44.470
<v Speaker 3>just go out and do them and then you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>teach another guy.</v>

3194
02:12:44.470 --> 02:12:45.970
<v Speaker 3>You can teach them the same shit for 100</v>
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>

3195
02:12:45.980 --> 02:12:48.860
<v Speaker 3>will never fucking figure out how to </v>
<v Speaker 3>pull it off on a live person.</v>

3196
02:12:48.920 --> 02:12:50.160
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3197
02:12:50.180 --> 02:12:52.830
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with Sunnen and Silva it,</v>

3198
02:12:52.870 --> 02:12:57.870
<v Speaker 3>do you think there's a lot of pr?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a lot of pressure on </v>

3199
02:12:57.870 --> 02:12:59.921
<v Speaker 3>syllabus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think he has an undue amount of </v>

3200
02:12:59.921 --> 02:12:59.921
<v Speaker 3>pressure on them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3201
02:12:59.921 --> 02:13:01.670
<v Speaker 3>like John Jones Silva is a incredible </v>
<v Speaker 3>special athlete.</v>

3202
02:13:01.910 --> 02:13:02.610
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3203
02:13:02.810 --> 02:13:06.190
<v Speaker 3>what makes John Jones so amazing is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you look at his,</v>

3204
02:13:06.250 --> 02:13:09.770
<v Speaker 3>his who's who of opponents since he </v>
<v Speaker 3>started the UFC,</v>

3205
02:13:09.771 --> 02:13:14.300
<v Speaker 3>and then you look back and see the guy's</v>
<v Speaker 3>only been around for four years in mma.</v>

3206
02:13:14.330 --> 02:13:19.330
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really incredible what he's </v>

3207
02:13:19.330 --> 02:13:19.330
<v Speaker 3>accomplished.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3208
02:13:19.330 --> 02:13:21.620
<v Speaker 3>Jon Jones is truly the newest next level</v>
<v Speaker 3>of athlete.</v>

3209
02:13:22.010 --> 02:13:23.810
<v Speaker 3>Anderson Silva is a totally different </v>
<v Speaker 3>story.</v>

3210
02:13:23.930 --> 02:13:28.930
<v Speaker 3>Anderson Silva is a real veteran.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a guy who at one point in time </v>

3211
02:13:28.930 --> 02:13:32.351
<v Speaker 3>didn't have a ground game and he has </v>
<v Speaker 3>some losses in the past and he's </v>

3212
02:13:32.351 --> 02:13:32.351
<v Speaker 3>vulnerability.</v>

3213
02:13:32.370 --> 02:13:34.560
<v Speaker 3>He's lost at the highlight on some </v>
<v Speaker 3>highlight,</v>

3214
02:13:34.561 --> 02:13:39.561
<v Speaker 3>real loose losses like Takahashi mounted</v>
<v Speaker 3>triangle or run Rio tone and hit him </v>

3215
02:13:40.381 --> 02:13:41.670
<v Speaker 3>with a flying wheel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hook,</v>

3216
02:13:41.700 --> 02:13:42.450
<v Speaker 3>eats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>flying,</v>

3217
02:13:42.451 --> 02:13:45.750
<v Speaker 3>scissors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a sweep them like a fucking movie.</v>

3218
02:13:45.780 --> 02:13:49.560
<v Speaker 3>I mean he dove on his legs like pro </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrestling was crazy and then caught them</v>

3219
02:13:49.561 --> 02:13:50.850
<v Speaker 3>in a heel hook,</v>
<v Speaker 3>made him tap.</v>

3220
02:13:50.851 --> 02:13:52.290
<v Speaker 3>The whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Took like three seconds.</v>

3221
02:13:52.291 --> 02:13:53.780
<v Speaker 3>It was incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3222
02:13:53.790 --> 02:13:57.210
<v Speaker 3>so Anderson has tasted both victory and </v>
<v Speaker 3>defeat.</v>

3223
02:13:57.540 --> 02:13:59.460
<v Speaker 3>John Jones is a completely different </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

3224
02:13:59.700 --> 02:14:04.700
<v Speaker 3>Jon Jones is a this new level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this next level shit where he comes up </v>

3225
02:14:05.521 --> 02:14:08.450
<v Speaker 3>and you take all these veterans of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>game and he rag dolls,</v>

3226
02:14:08.820 --> 02:14:11.670
<v Speaker 3>ragdoll shogun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he ragdolled Shogun.</v>

3227
02:14:11.820 --> 02:14:13.980
<v Speaker 3>He jumping fucking kneed him in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>face.</v>

3228
02:14:13.981 --> 02:14:18.981
<v Speaker 3>The very first technique he throws and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he connects and then he just beat him </v>

3229
02:14:18.981 --> 02:14:19.290
<v Speaker 3>from pillar to post.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was never in trouble,</v>

3230
02:14:19.410 --> 02:14:24.410
<v Speaker 3>didn't see like Mochida hit them really </v>
<v Speaker 3>hard while like machita a really comes </v>

3231
02:14:24.410 --> 02:14:24.410
<v Speaker 3>from shots and he was fine.</v>

3232
02:14:24.410 --> 02:14:25.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean Machida is,</v>

3233
02:14:25.600 --> 02:14:29.790
<v Speaker 3>had the best result that anybody's had </v>
<v Speaker 3>against John in the first round.</v>

3234
02:14:30.030 --> 02:14:33.960
<v Speaker 3>It was probably one of the first rounds </v>
<v Speaker 3>that John's last in the UFC,</v>

3235
02:14:34.200 --> 02:14:35.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>machita one,</v>

3236
02:14:35.371 --> 02:14:37.860
<v Speaker 3>that striking exchange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then John takes him to the ground and</v>

3237
02:14:37.861 --> 02:14:42.861
<v Speaker 3>smashes them and choke them unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean what he can do to guys when he </v>

3238
02:14:43.051 --> 02:14:47.370
<v Speaker 3>manhandled stewards is very unusual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anderson is a different dude.</v>

3239
02:14:47.371 --> 02:14:52.371
<v Speaker 3>Anderson is not unbelievably physically </v>
<v Speaker 3>strong with Anderson is like a super </v>

3240
02:14:52.371 --> 02:14:57.291
<v Speaker 3>technician who's really dedicated to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>game and has developed his game in front</v>

3241
02:14:58.171 --> 02:15:00.540
<v Speaker 3>of our eyes were at one point in time he</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't have the ground game.</v>

3242
02:15:00.750 --> 02:15:05.750
<v Speaker 3>He was just mostly like a really bad ass</v>
<v Speaker 3>kickboxer that would try to take guys </v>

3243
02:15:05.750 --> 02:15:09.561
<v Speaker 3>heads down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then like a guy like Carlos Newton </v>

3244
02:15:09.561 --> 02:15:09.561
<v Speaker 3>got them down and mounted them and </v>
<v Speaker 3>really controlled.</v>

3245
02:15:09.561 --> 02:15:10.440
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty easy on the ground.</v>

3246
02:15:10.590 --> 02:15:13.650
<v Speaker 3>Takahashi did the same thing in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>minute and fight.</v>

3247
02:15:13.740 --> 02:15:17.370
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember what they gave him a </v>
<v Speaker 3>red flag or a yellow yellow card rather,</v>

3248
02:15:17.490 --> 02:15:22.490
<v Speaker 3>or I think they took some money off of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Newton because they said he was </v>

3249
02:15:22.490 --> 02:15:22.490
<v Speaker 3>stalling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they stood them back up.</v>

3250
02:15:22.490 --> 02:15:23.340
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but anyway,</v>

3251
02:15:23.341 --> 02:15:26.370
<v Speaker 3>the results over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for whatever reason,</v>

3252
02:15:26.371 --> 02:15:31.371
<v Speaker 3>they stood back up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anderson Silva flying kneed him in the </v>

3253
02:15:31.371 --> 02:15:33.321
<v Speaker 3>face and stopped him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when he would get stuck on the </v>

3254
02:15:33.321 --> 02:15:33.321
<v Speaker 3>ground,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes he would get tapped,</v>

3255
02:15:33.321 --> 02:15:38.090
<v Speaker 3>but he changed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He changed and evolved and became a guy </v>

3256
02:15:38.090 --> 02:15:38.640
<v Speaker 3>with a full game and then in the jail,</v>
<v Speaker 3>son and fight.</v>

3257
02:15:38.790 --> 02:15:39.480
<v Speaker 3>That was real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3258
02:15:39.550 --> 02:15:41.700
<v Speaker 3>he had already gotten Dan Henderson by </v>
<v Speaker 3>submission,</v>

3259
02:15:41.900 --> 02:15:46.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where he got Dan's back and then choked </v>

3260
02:15:46.900 --> 02:15:49.061
<v Speaker 3>him out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a trap tap Travis Luder with a </v>

3261
02:15:49.061 --> 02:15:52.550
<v Speaker 3>triangle tube,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was because he had travis luder </v>

3262
02:15:52.550 --> 02:15:52.550
<v Speaker 3>stuck in between his legs and he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>smashing it with elbows,</v>

3263
02:15:52.550 --> 02:15:53.880
<v Speaker 3>ruthless,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ruthless elbows,</v>

3264
02:15:54.210 --> 02:15:57.730
<v Speaker 3>but he developed a real ground game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a real Brazilian Jujitsu.</v>

3265
02:15:57.780 --> 02:15:59.760
<v Speaker 3>Black belt level ground is a black belt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3266
02:15:59.761 --> 02:16:00.300
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3267
02:16:00.301 --> 02:16:00.850
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a real.</v>

3268
02:16:00.900 --> 02:16:01.370
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

3269
02:16:01.530 --> 02:16:04.470
<v Speaker 3>not just a black belt like he's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's very high level,</v>

3270
02:16:04.471 --> 02:16:09.471
<v Speaker 3>he's a really good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When he caught Chael Sonnen with a </v>

3271
02:16:09.471 --> 02:16:11.751
<v Speaker 3>triangle that was some smooth technique </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was the fifth round of a fight </v>

3272
02:16:11.751 --> 02:16:13.510
<v Speaker 3>where he was getting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he had lost every round I think did.</v>

3273
02:16:14.010 --> 02:16:15.480
<v Speaker 3>He did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no question about it.</v>

3274
02:16:15.680 --> 02:16:18.750
<v Speaker 3>It would be a crime to state that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't lose those rounds.</v>

3275
02:16:18.751 --> 02:16:21.420
<v Speaker 3>If anybody gave those rounds to Anderson</v>
<v Speaker 3>there should be arrested.</v>

3276
02:16:21.540 --> 02:16:23.790
<v Speaker 3>And do you think that jail,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it shows you something.</v>

3277
02:16:23.791 --> 02:16:28.791
<v Speaker 3>It's obviously a heartbreaking loss,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the fact that he kept going after </v>

3278
02:16:28.791 --> 02:16:29.950
<v Speaker 3>them instead of just dancing and staying</v>
<v Speaker 3>away for last couple of minutes,</v>

3279
02:16:29.951 --> 02:16:31.900
<v Speaker 3>which he could have done in easily won </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fight,</v>

3280
02:16:32.140 --> 02:16:33.340
<v Speaker 3>but channels an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3281
02:16:33.341 --> 02:16:33.960
<v Speaker 3>it's also there.</v>

3282
02:16:33.970 --> 02:16:36.640
<v Speaker 3>He was exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you've got to realize he's fought</v>

3283
02:16:36.641 --> 02:16:41.290
<v Speaker 3>for and a half rounds going 150 miles an</v>
<v Speaker 3>hour taking the guy down,</v>

3284
02:16:41.470 --> 02:16:43.450
<v Speaker 3>lifting up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>near slamming them down,</v>

3285
02:16:43.630 --> 02:16:48.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in chill was on the podcast and he was </v>

3286
02:16:48.630 --> 02:16:49.380
<v Speaker 3>talking about how tiring it is and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>

3287
02:16:49.390 --> 02:16:52.570
<v Speaker 3>he's really honest about shit like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things I love about that guy,</v>

3288
02:16:52.810 --> 02:16:54.940
<v Speaker 3>he said that just you're not supposed </v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

3289
02:16:55.120 --> 02:16:57.710
<v Speaker 3>a human body is not supposed to fight </v>
<v Speaker 3>five,</v>

3290
02:16:58.080 --> 02:17:00.400
<v Speaker 3>five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five minute rounds going full clip.</v>

3291
02:17:00.460 --> 02:17:05.460
<v Speaker 3>You just simply can't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you have to figure out how much </v>

3292
02:17:05.460 --> 02:17:06.370
<v Speaker 3>energy you're going to exert,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how you know you're going to try to pace</v>

3293
02:17:06.371 --> 02:17:11.371
<v Speaker 3>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to try to slowly dragged </v>

3294
02:17:11.371 --> 02:17:14.221
<v Speaker 3>this fight out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know if you completely go for </v>

3295
02:17:14.221 --> 02:17:14.221
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like in the vandelay rich Franklin fight</v>

3296
02:17:14.221 --> 02:17:15.790
<v Speaker 3>that you see that design was great </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>

3297
02:17:16.120 --> 02:17:19.990
<v Speaker 3>Vandelay caught rich Franklin the second</v>
<v Speaker 3>round and almost put them away.</v>

3298
02:17:20.020 --> 02:17:22.270
<v Speaker 3>Had them really hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>jumped all over him,</v>

3299
02:17:22.271 --> 02:17:27.271
<v Speaker 3>swarmed on him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but burned himself out because Franklin </v>

3300
02:17:27.271 --> 02:17:28.540
<v Speaker 3>survived and then in the third round </v>
<v Speaker 3>vandelay was done.</v>

3301
02:17:28.541 --> 02:17:30.660
<v Speaker 3>He was just exhausted and then Franklin </v>
<v Speaker 3>took them down,</v>

3302
02:17:30.670 --> 02:17:32.160
<v Speaker 3>beat him up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then the enemy,</v>

3303
02:17:32.220 --> 02:17:36.490
<v Speaker 3>it probably cost vandelay the fight </v>
<v Speaker 3>because he went for the knockout.</v>

3304
02:17:36.520 --> 02:17:41.520
<v Speaker 3>It's like a perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you really can't go full clip </v>

3305
02:17:41.520 --> 02:17:43.750
<v Speaker 3>for five rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their body just doesn't work that way.</v>

3306
02:17:43.990 --> 02:17:47.140
<v Speaker 3>So you think like a sprint.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't sprint for 25 minutes,</v>

3307
02:17:47.170 --> 02:17:48.940
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's one guy I'm dying to get on Opie</v>

3308
02:17:48.941 --> 02:17:49.900
<v Speaker 3>and Anthony,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I've met him.</v>

3309
02:17:49.901 --> 02:17:51.820
<v Speaker 3>I've spoken to him briefly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said he would do it.</v>

3310
02:17:51.850 --> 02:17:52.900
<v Speaker 3>He wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's never in New York.</v>

3311
02:17:53.260 --> 02:17:53.980
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3312
02:17:53.981 --> 02:17:56.110
<v Speaker 3>you know what man?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You talked to Dana White.</v>

3313
02:17:56.530 --> 02:17:58.600
<v Speaker 3>Especially if he wins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3314
02:17:58.601 --> 02:18:03.601
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure they're going to want to put </v>
<v Speaker 3>him on some crazy tort and even if he </v>

3315
02:18:03.601 --> 02:18:03.601
<v Speaker 3>loses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'll do a tour.</v>

3316
02:18:03.601 --> 02:18:03.760
<v Speaker 3>I hope so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3317
02:18:03.761 --> 02:18:05.680
<v Speaker 3>He'll do a tour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a bad motherfucker.</v>

3318
02:18:05.681 --> 02:18:08.140
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's and he's a publicity machine.</v>

3319
02:18:08.141 --> 02:18:09.580
<v Speaker 3>That guy does everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was funny.</v>

3320
02:18:09.581 --> 02:18:11.110
<v Speaker 3>I saw an interview you did with him </v>
<v Speaker 3>where he goes,</v>

3321
02:18:11.111 --> 02:18:12.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm not that fight promotion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you're like,</v>

3322
02:18:12.881 --> 02:18:16.090
<v Speaker 3>well actually what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think my balls for calling him out on it</v>

3323
02:18:16.091 --> 02:18:17.200
<v Speaker 3>because very funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3324
02:18:17.201 --> 02:18:22.201
<v Speaker 3>it's fun to hear him defend himself too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he has the best definitions of </v>

3325
02:18:22.201 --> 02:18:22.690
<v Speaker 3>things where you just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What he was talking about the fight,</v>

3326
02:18:22.691 --> 02:18:23.650
<v Speaker 3>like losing the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

3327
02:18:23.651 --> 02:18:28.600
<v Speaker 3>I did not lose to Anderson Silva.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know where you come from,</v>

3328
02:18:28.601 --> 02:18:32.830
<v Speaker 3>but where I come from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you hold a man down and beat the shit</v>

3329
02:18:32.831 --> 02:18:37.831
<v Speaker 3>out of him for five rounds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then he wraps his legs around your head </v>

3330
02:18:37.831 --> 02:18:39.580
<v Speaker 3>for eight seconds and he wins.</v>

3331
02:18:40.230 --> 02:18:42.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He does have a great way of like,</v>

3332
02:18:42.700 --> 02:18:45.190
<v Speaker 3>how many fighters would take that </v>
<v Speaker 3>approach?</v>

3333
02:18:45.340 --> 02:18:50.340
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody else would take this approach </v>

3334
02:18:50.340 --> 02:18:50.340
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3335
02:18:50.340 --> 02:18:50.740
<v Speaker 3>try to be humble or try to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3336
02:18:50.741 --> 02:18:51.220
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3337
02:18:51.221 --> 02:18:56.221
<v Speaker 3>God puts a mysterious plans in front of </v>
<v Speaker 3>me and I'm going to go back to the </v>

3338
02:18:56.221 --> 02:18:59.911
<v Speaker 3>drawing board and see what I can do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And instead he pretends that he's </v>

3339
02:18:59.911 --> 02:19:00.370
<v Speaker 3>undefeated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>undisputed.</v>

3340
02:19:00.520 --> 02:19:03.220
<v Speaker 3>He brings a fake belt to the press </v>
<v Speaker 3>conferences.</v>

3341
02:19:03.440 --> 02:19:08.440
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just takes things to a completely </v>

3342
02:19:08.440 --> 02:19:10.300
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous and new and original level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His level is very different.</v>

3343
02:19:10.301 --> 02:19:13.270
<v Speaker 3>Like his top trash talking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my opinion,</v>

3344
02:19:13.271 --> 02:19:17.020
<v Speaker 3>is so much more interesting than a guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>like Muhammad Ali because Muhammad Ali's</v>

3345
02:19:17.021 --> 02:19:21.640
<v Speaker 3>trash-talking was at least he was being </v>
<v Speaker 3>honest about his skills and he was being</v>

3346
02:19:21.641 --> 02:19:26.641
<v Speaker 3>honest about his past.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he's denying entire chapters is,</v>

3347
02:19:27.670 --> 02:19:28.040
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3348
02:19:28.090 --> 02:19:30.440
<v Speaker 1>of his print,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his record undefeated.</v>

3349
02:19:30.441 --> 02:19:32.900
<v Speaker 1>Undisputed he says he's the champion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's funny,</v>

3350
02:19:33.050 --> 02:19:35.120
<v Speaker 1>just something really entertaining about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

3351
02:19:35.121 --> 02:19:36.650
<v Speaker 1>but does that get distracting as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighter?</v>

3352
02:19:36.651 --> 02:19:41.651
<v Speaker 1>Like when you're fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you get distracted or caught up in </v>

3353
02:19:41.651 --> 02:19:44.231
<v Speaker 1>that out in the training camp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I wonder if that becomes a </v>

3354
02:19:44.231 --> 02:19:47.831
<v Speaker 1>distraction at all because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're so busy building this kind of </v>

3355
02:19:47.831 --> 02:19:48.560
<v Speaker 1>machine around you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's PR machine.</v>

3356
02:19:48.970 --> 02:19:49.300
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3357
02:19:49.340 --> 02:19:51.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't want to raise rocky three</v>
<v Speaker 1>is an example,</v>

3358
02:19:51.580 --> 02:19:54.020
<v Speaker 1>but I mean even though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's on the losing end of it,</v>

3359
02:19:54.021 --> 02:19:56.720
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does that get distracting for a fighter?</v>

3360
02:19:57.080 --> 02:19:58.670
<v Speaker 1>It can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It depends on the guy.</v>

3361
02:19:58.700 --> 02:19:59.170
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3362
02:19:59.171 --> 02:20:02.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how jail handles it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3363
02:20:02.900 --> 02:20:07.900
<v Speaker 1>but you think about how much trash you </v>
<v Speaker 1>talked before the first Anderson Silva </v>

3364
02:20:07.900 --> 02:20:10.660
<v Speaker 1>fight and he fought pretty fucking good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then again there's the talk that </v>

3365
02:20:10.660 --> 02:20:12.770
<v Speaker 1>Anderson was injured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her fight that he had an issue,</v>

3366
02:20:13.070 --> 02:20:18.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how much of it played a </v>

3367
02:20:18.070 --> 02:20:18.070
<v Speaker 1>factor.</v>

3368
02:20:18.070 --> 02:20:20.470
<v Speaker 1>Anderson in the past has had issues with</v>
<v Speaker 1>some guys that were wrestlers like </v>

3369
02:20:20.470 --> 02:20:25.391
<v Speaker 1>Travis Luder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that was another fight that he took </v>

3370
02:20:25.391 --> 02:20:28.061
<v Speaker 1>injured.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know for sure he was injured because </v>

3371
02:20:28.061 --> 02:20:30.641
<v Speaker 1>his manager told me after that fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>that Anderson had had meniscus surgery </v>

3372
02:20:30.641 --> 02:20:32.300
<v Speaker 1>on both knees just five weeks before </v>
<v Speaker 1>that fight.</v>

3373
02:20:32.870 --> 02:20:33.950
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3374
02:20:33.951 --> 02:20:38.090
<v Speaker 1>the fact that he was able to have a cage</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight and defend the world title against</v>

3375
02:20:38.091 --> 02:20:42.430
<v Speaker 1>a tough guy like Travis Luder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five weeks after meniscus surgery.</v>

3376
02:20:42.440 --> 02:20:43.850
<v Speaker 1>Cut your knee open man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they,</v>

3377
02:20:44.020 --> 02:20:46.130
<v Speaker 1>they trim out the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a padded area.</v>

3378
02:20:46.131 --> 02:20:50.090
<v Speaker 1>Some of the padded area in between your </v>
<v Speaker 1>knee gets broken up and torn,</v>

3379
02:20:50.180 --> 02:20:53.330
<v Speaker 1>especially doing Jujitsu and wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of guys tear,</v>

3380
02:20:53.680 --> 02:20:54.610
<v Speaker 1>tear their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3381
02:20:54.620 --> 02:20:56.600
<v Speaker 1>their tissue inside their knee and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>go in,</v>

3382
02:20:56.601 --> 02:20:58.940
<v Speaker 1>they scope it and they cleaned it up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>smooth it out.</v>

3383
02:20:59.110 --> 02:21:00.860
<v Speaker 1>And he kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he fought five weeks later.</v>

3384
02:21:00.920 --> 02:21:02.830
<v Speaker 1>Have you had surgeries?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had that.</v>

3385
02:21:02.831 --> 02:21:04.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Five weeks later is incredible.</v>

3386
02:21:04.550 --> 02:21:05.810
<v Speaker 1>It's a fucking man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Surgery.</v>

3387
02:21:05.840 --> 02:21:07.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Five weeks later it still hurts.</v>

3388
02:21:07.790 --> 02:21:12.790
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still sore when you get on your </v>

3389
02:21:12.790 --> 02:21:12.790
<v Speaker 1>knees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

3390
02:21:12.790 --> 02:21:14.980
<v Speaker 1>And this guy is fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had my turbinates shrunk recently and </v>

3391
02:21:14.980 --> 02:21:17.711
<v Speaker 1>I felt like a warrior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they put the fucking needle in my </v>

3392
02:21:17.711 --> 02:21:17.711
<v Speaker 1>nose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I can read a little bit better.</v>

3393
02:21:17.711 --> 02:21:18.230
<v Speaker 1>I felt good about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you get the fuck out man.</v>

3394
02:21:18.260 --> 02:21:19.910
<v Speaker 1>Injuries did well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had the uh,</v>

3395
02:21:19.911 --> 02:21:23.060
<v Speaker 1>the nose thing too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a deviated septum operation.</v>

3396
02:21:23.061 --> 02:21:25.010
<v Speaker 1>Let me test for a fucking brilliant </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

3397
02:21:25.011 --> 02:21:30.011
<v Speaker 1>That is that I'm so happy that doctors </v>
<v Speaker 1>figured out a way to fix your fucking </v>

3398
02:21:30.011 --> 02:21:33.731
<v Speaker 1>nose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can breathe out of it for people who </v>

3399
02:21:33.731 --> 02:21:33.731
<v Speaker 1>have that issue and you can't breed that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he knows.</v>

3400
02:21:33.770 --> 02:21:36.260
<v Speaker 1>Take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can set aside some time,</v>

3401
02:21:36.261 --> 02:21:41.261
<v Speaker 1>plan it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>set aside some time to get that shit </v>

3402
02:21:41.261 --> 02:21:41.261
<v Speaker 1>fixed.</v>

3403
02:21:41.261 --> 02:21:41.270
<v Speaker 1>My God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a freeing feeling.</v>

3404
02:21:41.420 --> 02:21:45.770
<v Speaker 1>The first time I can go my whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My nose was useless.</v>

3405
02:21:45.771 --> 02:21:49.060
<v Speaker 1>I broke my nose and I was like five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my whole life is like a terrible,</v>

3406
02:21:49.580 --> 02:21:50.570
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the worst.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Not Breathing.</v>

3408
02:21:52.180 --> 02:21:54.920
<v Speaker 1>I wonder how many shitty decisions I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>made in my life because I wasn't getting</v>

3409
02:21:54.960 --> 02:21:57.560
<v Speaker 1>enough oxygen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kidding,</v>

3411
02:22:02.590 --> 02:22:04.040
<v Speaker 1>why they call people mouth breathers and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think of them as idiots.</v>

3412
02:22:04.041 --> 02:22:06.920
<v Speaker 1>This mouth breathing fucking idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because of your mouth is open.</v>

3413

3420
02:22:21.390 --> 02:22:24.410
<v Speaker 1>I want to get just a further.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The punishment.</v>

3421
02:22:26.130 --> 02:22:28.440
<v Speaker 1>There was a guy that used to post on my </v>
<v Speaker 1>message board,</v>

3422
02:22:28.680 --> 02:22:30.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he was telling the truth</v>
<v Speaker 1>or not.</v>

3423
02:22:30.330 --> 02:22:35.330
<v Speaker 1>It was a really interesting sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing because the guy was obviously a </v>

3424
02:22:35.330 --> 02:22:38.451
<v Speaker 1>very talented writer and he had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>website where he would write about his </v>

3425
02:22:38.451 --> 02:22:40.820
<v Speaker 1>encounters with women and he would set </v>
<v Speaker 1>up these,</v>

3426
02:22:40.830 --> 02:22:45.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women who are low income women who </v>

3427
02:22:45.830 --> 02:22:45.830
<v Speaker 1>needed money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mean easy women?</v>

3428
02:22:45.900 --> 02:22:47.660
<v Speaker 1>Slowly but surely he would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3429
02:22:48.020 --> 02:22:53.020
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>integrate himself into their lives and </v>

3430
02:22:53.020 --> 02:22:53.820
<v Speaker 1>start a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You like having them,</v>

3431
02:22:53.870 --> 02:22:55.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obligated to him,</v>

3432
02:22:55.111 --> 02:22:57.440
<v Speaker 1>like giving them an apartment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sugar daddy shit.</v>

3433
02:22:57.720 --> 02:23:00.960
<v Speaker 1>But he would do it nice and slow and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then he would start getting them to suck</v>

3434
02:23:00.961 --> 02:23:02.010
<v Speaker 1>his dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's how they,</v>

3435
02:23:02.040 --> 02:23:04.170
<v Speaker 1>that's how they started paying him </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they didn't have any money.</v>

3436
02:23:04.170 --> 02:23:09.170
<v Speaker 1>Like he was gonna call the cops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this guy like would orchestrate </v>

3437
02:23:09.170 --> 02:23:11.590
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would know that they couldn't afford </v>

3438
02:23:11.590 --> 02:23:13.551
<v Speaker 1>things and set them up and even even </v>
<v Speaker 1>loan them some money at first to get </v>

3439
02:23:13.551 --> 02:23:17.061
<v Speaker 1>things rolling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when they couldn't pay him </v>

3440
02:23:17.061 --> 02:23:17.061
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would start saying,</v>

3441
02:23:17.061 --> 02:23:17.061
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to work this out.</v>

3442
02:23:17.061 --> 02:23:21.290
<v Speaker 1>And he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would purposely make his diet </v>

3443
02:23:21.290 --> 02:23:24.440
<v Speaker 1>disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would eat asparagus and s and drink </v>

3444
02:23:24.440 --> 02:23:27.921
<v Speaker 1>black coffee and he had like a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different things that he would eat to </v>

3445
02:23:27.921 --> 02:23:31.110
<v Speaker 1>purposely make his loads disgusting and </v>
<v Speaker 1>cigarettes to some,</v>

3446
02:23:31.111 --> 02:23:32.280
<v Speaker 1>I think it was cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>

3447
02:23:32.370 --> 02:23:36.630
<v Speaker 1>do you remember this guy did this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3448
02:23:36.631 --> 02:23:41.631
<v Speaker 1>people banned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They banned them eventually from the </v>

3449
02:23:41.631 --> 02:23:41.631
<v Speaker 1>message board because he was such a </v>
<v Speaker 1>creep.</v>

3450
02:23:41.631 --> 02:23:41.631
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

3451
02:23:41.631 --> 02:23:41.631
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would have these.</v>

3452
02:23:41.631 --> 02:23:43.980
<v Speaker 1>Even if they weren't true stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were brilliantly,</v>

3453
02:23:44.100 --> 02:23:44.880
<v Speaker 1>brilliantly written.</v>

3454
02:23:45.060 --> 02:23:46.710
<v Speaker 1>It was really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The writing,</v>

3455
02:23:46.711 --> 02:23:51.711
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like the inside the mind of a </v>

3456
02:23:51.711 --> 02:23:54.351
<v Speaker 1>total sociopath that is just getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>these poor girls and just doing crazy </v>

<v Speaker 1>like abuse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything was like swallow his load.</v>

3461
02:24:04.231 --> 02:24:09.231
<v Speaker 1>After he ate all this asparagus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything was like he just wanted them </v>

3462
02:24:09.231 --> 02:24:11.400
<v Speaker 1>to just feel completely demeaned and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then he would move on and go to the next</v>

3463
02:24:11.401 --> 02:24:16.401
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had another girl set up channel like </v>

<v Speaker 1>but I never,</v>

3466
02:24:16.771 --> 02:24:21.771
<v Speaker 1>I want it to be because we're coming to </v>
<v Speaker 1>an understanding like I'm too average </v>

3467

<v Speaker 1>Like I don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like women are hurt.</v>

3470
02:24:24.681 --> 02:24:29.211
<v Speaker 1>I don't like when women feel demeaned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I never want to go to field </v>

3471
02:24:29.211 --> 02:24:29.211
<v Speaker 1>demeaned.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's a great transaction.</v>

02:24:31.981 --> 02:24:34.470
<v Speaker 1>We just had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never want them to feel degraded.</v>

<v Speaker 1>neat pussy and I'm,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that's all I want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never want them to feel bad about it.</v>

3479
02:24:42.390 --> 02:24:43.560
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a funny thing man,</v>

3480
02:24:43.561 --> 02:24:46.230
<v Speaker 1>because really if they had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they had sex with you for free,</v>

3481
02:24:46.231 --> 02:24:47.880
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing wrong with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3482
02:24:47.910 --> 02:24:49.530
<v Speaker 1>if they decided to give you a blow job </v>
<v Speaker 1>for free,</v>

3483
02:24:49.531 --> 02:24:51.000
<v Speaker 1>people do it all day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all over the world.</v>

3484
02:24:51.240 --> 02:24:53.310
<v Speaker 1>But if somehow or another you give them </v>
<v Speaker 1>some money,</v>

3485
02:24:53.460 --> 02:24:58.460
<v Speaker 1>then then it becomes a terrible thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there are moral and they've made a </v>

3486
02:24:58.460 --> 02:24:58.890
<v Speaker 1>decision to get sex for money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3487
02:24:59.130 --> 02:25:04.130
<v Speaker 1>people always done that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but women have done that throughout </v>

3488
02:25:04.130 --> 02:25:04.130
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's pretty women.</v>

3490
02:25:05.701 --> 02:25:07.590
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing wrong with that.</v>

3491
02:25:07.630 --> 02:25:09.000

<v Speaker 5>Fuck you gonna buy somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll watch.</v>

3517
02:26:04.090 --> 02:26:09.090
<v Speaker 5>What is the standard going rate for like</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that for getting jerked off as that </v>

3518
02:26:09.090 --> 02:26:10.150

<v Speaker 5>300 bucks.</v>

3519
02:26:10.151 --> 02:26:11.440
<v Speaker 5>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Three and four.</v>

3520
02:26:11.441 --> 02:26:16.441
<v Speaker 5>It depends.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If the girls are massage therapist and </v>

3521
02:26:16.441 --> 02:26:18.271
<v Speaker 5>not an escort,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sometimes you can get jerked off for </v>

3522
02:26:18.271 --> 02:26:18.271
<v Speaker 5>three slash 50.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I spend more than I should,</v>

3523
02:26:18.271 --> 02:26:18.490
<v Speaker 5>but I figured,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what,</v>

3524
02:26:18.491 --> 02:26:19.960
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to knock a checkup doing </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

3525
02:26:19.961 --> 02:26:24.961
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's gonna be no horrible </v>

3526
02:26:24.961 --> 02:26:26.990
<v Speaker 5>repercussions from doing that because </v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3527
02:26:27.280 --> 02:26:32.280
<v Speaker 5>the amount of money you pay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you fucking get somebody pregnant is </v>

3528
02:26:32.280 --> 02:26:32.410
<v Speaker 5>18 years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>20 years of tuition and all that.</v>

3529
02:26:32.620 --> 02:26:37.620
<v Speaker 5>Fuck that man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you feel weird about letting them </v>

3530
02:26:37.620 --> 02:26:37.620
<v Speaker 5>come to your house?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

3531
02:26:37.620 --> 02:26:37.620
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

3532
02:26:37.620 --> 02:26:38.350
<v Speaker 5>I love him at my house.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's my space.</v>

3533
02:26:38.860 --> 02:26:40.840
<v Speaker 5>I know that there's nobody going to film</v>
<v Speaker 5>me.</v>

3534
02:26:40.841 --> 02:26:43.390
<v Speaker 5>I know that nobody's going to take a uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>rob me.</v>

3535
02:26:43.440 --> 02:26:46.510
<v Speaker 5>I know I'm in a secure building.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had the security of my building.</v>

3536
02:26:46.511 --> 02:26:49.720
<v Speaker 5>This fucking a concierge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a very secure place.</v>

3537
02:26:49.750 --> 02:26:54.750
<v Speaker 5>Did you get a place and think about the </v>
<v Speaker 5>fact that you're going to bring escorts </v>

3538
02:26:54.750 --> 02:26:56.770
<v Speaker 5>back to it so you need certain things </v>
<v Speaker 5>set up it.</v>

3539
02:26:56.840 --> 02:27:01.840
<v Speaker 5>Everything I've ever done is somehow or </v>
<v Speaker 5>how many got horse in my house that has </v>

3540
02:27:01.840 --> 02:27:01.840
<v Speaker 5>an underground garage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

3541
02:27:01.840 --> 02:27:06.361
<v Speaker 5>good,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because I fucking training with the </v>

3542
02:27:06.361 --> 02:27:07.621
<v Speaker 5>blonde hair.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't have her coming through the </v>

3543
02:27:07.621 --> 02:27:07.621
<v Speaker 5>lobby.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You always gotta think of that Shit.</v>

3544
02:27:07.621 --> 02:27:08.620
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's hilarious man.</v>

3545
02:27:08.830 --> 02:27:10.870
<v Speaker 5>But I did the building.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I actually just love it.</v>

3546
02:27:10.871 --> 02:27:14.080
<v Speaker 5>I did think that's great that there's </v>
<v Speaker 5>security there because while I liked the</v>

3547
02:27:14.081 --> 02:27:16.270
<v Speaker 5>idea of people not knowing my comings </v>
<v Speaker 5>and goings,</v>

3548
02:27:16.271 --> 02:27:21.271
<v Speaker 5>I like being safe more and now you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>not going to have anybody act up at a </v>

3549
02:27:21.271 --> 02:27:21.400
<v Speaker 5>building with security unless you get </v>
<v Speaker 5>out of line.</v>

3550
02:27:21.400 --> 02:27:26.400
<v Speaker 5>But normally they're not going to act up</v>
<v Speaker 5>because they just want to get the money </v>

3551
02:27:26.400 --> 02:27:26.400
<v Speaker 5>and fucking go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3552
02:27:26.400 --> 02:27:28.120
<v Speaker 5>I've had a couple.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had a scary experience one time I went</v>

3553
02:27:28.121 --> 02:27:31.660
<v Speaker 5>to a house to get like jerked off years </v>
<v Speaker 5>ago.</v>

3554
02:27:31.661 --> 02:27:36.661
<v Speaker 5>It was right off second avenue and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>walked in and it was like really dark </v>

3555
02:27:36.661 --> 02:27:40.501
<v Speaker 5>and she was shady and she was holding a </v>
<v Speaker 5>screwdriver and I went to piss and there</v>

3556
02:27:40.511 --> 02:27:45.511
<v Speaker 5>was like a really weird water in the tub</v>
<v Speaker 5>and there was like Burger King rappers </v>

3557
02:27:45.511 --> 02:27:45.511
<v Speaker 5>in it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

3558
02:27:45.511 --> 02:27:49.960
<v Speaker 5>there was fruit flies and I sat down and</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was dark and the rest of the room,</v>

3559
02:27:49.961 --> 02:27:52.450
<v Speaker 5>it was a messy house,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a railroad apartment in New York.</v>

3560
02:27:53.080 --> 02:27:58.080
<v Speaker 5>And I felt that something very evil was </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the room and I very rarely if ever </v>

3561
02:27:58.421 --> 02:28:03.421
<v Speaker 5>get that feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I knew there was somebody else in </v>

3562
02:28:03.421 --> 02:28:03.421
<v Speaker 5>the room with us and they were just in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the back,</v>

3563
02:28:03.421 --> 02:28:07.741
<v Speaker 5>like looking through a door,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I could sense that there was a person </v>

3564
02:28:07.741 --> 02:28:07.741
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

3565
02:28:07.741 --> 02:28:08.080
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and she was holding this screwdriver the</v>

3566
02:28:08.081 --> 02:28:11.080
<v Speaker 5>whole time and I just started to get </v>
<v Speaker 5>very scared,</v>

3567
02:28:11.081 --> 02:28:14.410
<v Speaker 5>like we have these instincts and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>listened to my instincts and I'm like,</v>

3568
02:28:14.411 --> 02:28:15.260
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3569
02:28:15.280 --> 02:28:16.030
<v Speaker 5>I'm sick.</v>

3570
02:28:16.090 --> 02:28:21.090
<v Speaker 5>I can't do this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I paid her the money and I just </v>

3571
02:28:21.090 --> 02:28:21.090
<v Speaker 5>left.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I knew I had.</v>

3572
02:28:21.090 --> 02:28:23.150
<v Speaker 5>I had dodged a bullet because her hands </v>
<v Speaker 5>were dirty.</v>

3573
02:28:23.390 --> 02:28:28.390
<v Speaker 5>There was something that was one of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>scariest moments in my life because I </v>

3574
02:28:28.390 --> 02:28:29.200
<v Speaker 5>couldn't see who was the apartment was </v>
<v Speaker 5>again.</v>

3575
02:28:29.210 --> 02:28:30.920
<v Speaker 5>It was really a little bit lit when I </v>
<v Speaker 5>walked in,</v>

3576
02:28:31.770 --> 02:28:33.800
<v Speaker 5>when I gave him the money,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she went to the door and open it.</v>

3577
02:28:33.920 --> 02:28:35.780
<v Speaker 5>She might've just faked handing it to </v>
<v Speaker 5>somebody,</v>

3578
02:28:36.080 --> 02:28:38.300
<v Speaker 5>but my sense that somebody was in that </v>
<v Speaker 5>room with us was very,</v>

3579
02:28:38.301 --> 02:28:43.301
<v Speaker 5>very strong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that was a case and that's why I </v>

3580
02:28:43.301 --> 02:28:45.010
<v Speaker 5>don't go to places where I think there </v>
<v Speaker 5>are a lot of them would have Sony in the</v>

3581
02:28:45.011 --> 02:28:50.011
<v Speaker 5>movie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the room with them just for protection </v>

3582
02:28:50.011 --> 02:28:50.011
<v Speaker 5>or next door.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3583
02:28:50.011 --> 02:28:50.011
<v Speaker 5>A lot of them do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do,</v>

3584
02:28:50.011 --> 02:28:50.330
<v Speaker 5>a lot of them do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do that,</v>

3585
02:28:50.331 --> 02:28:52.160
<v Speaker 5>but I don't think that there'll be a </v>
<v Speaker 5>smart thing to do.</v>

3586
02:28:52.160 --> 02:28:52.790
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3587
02:28:52.791 --> 02:28:54.530
<v Speaker 5>Well they have them within shouting </v>
<v Speaker 5>distance.</v>

3588
02:28:54.770 --> 02:28:59.770
<v Speaker 5>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was something extra to have them </v>

3589
02:28:59.770 --> 02:29:00.800
<v Speaker 5>in the room because you just threatened </v>
<v Speaker 5>me with a screwdriver.</v>

3590
02:29:00.801 --> 02:29:05.801
<v Speaker 5>Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fifty extra for the Philips has dirty </v>

3591
02:29:05.801 --> 02:29:05.801
<v Speaker 5>hands who said yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she was just dirty.</v>

3592
02:29:05.801 --> 02:29:10.431
<v Speaker 5>It was something fucking shady going on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I knew it and I felt that I had done </v>

3593
02:29:10.431 --> 02:29:10.640
<v Speaker 5>that enough times to know when something</v>
<v Speaker 5>was off,</v>

3594
02:29:10.970 --> 02:29:15.970
<v Speaker 5>something was really off and that's why </v>
<v Speaker 5>people get killed because they don't </v>

3595
02:29:15.970 --> 02:29:15.970
<v Speaker 5>listen to that instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

3596
02:29:15.970 --> 02:29:20.651
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I listened to it and I'm not saying </v>

3597
02:29:20.651 --> 02:29:20.651
<v Speaker 5>I was going to get killed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but something bad was gonna happen.</v>

3598
02:29:20.651 --> 02:29:23.420
<v Speaker 5>And I absolutely know it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then how long did it take before you</v>

3599
02:29:23.421 --> 02:29:25.010
<v Speaker 5>wanted to get laid again?</v>
<v Speaker 5>After that?</v>

3600
02:29:25.080 --> 02:29:29.030
<v Speaker 5>I probably acted out the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My Dick didn't know what happened.</v>

3601
02:29:29.200 --> 02:29:30.180
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

3602
02:29:32.030 --> 02:29:35.600
<v Speaker 5>actually man up plus he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jesus Christ.</v>

3603
02:29:35.660 --> 02:29:37.290
<v Speaker 5>That was scary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3604
02:29:37.370 --> 02:29:38.210
<v Speaker 5>How did you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3605
02:29:38.330 --> 02:29:40.340
<v Speaker 5>how did you get out of there?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>

3606
02:29:40.341 --> 02:29:43.160
<v Speaker 5>I said I think I like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have cancer and I'm not feeling well.</v>

3607
02:29:43.161 --> 02:29:44.730
<v Speaker 5>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all cancer think I said,</v>

3608
02:29:45.120 --> 02:29:46.570
<v Speaker 5>I said some really like I have cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

3609
02:29:46.571 --> 02:29:51.571
<v Speaker 5>I feeling for some really weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't want to spook her.</v>

3610
02:29:51.760 --> 02:29:52.100
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she,</v>

3611
02:29:52.101 --> 02:29:54.170
<v Speaker 5>I remember she had a blonde hair.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was a wig,</v>

3612
02:29:54.550 --> 02:29:59.550
<v Speaker 5>something so wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was something so raw with,</v>

3613
02:30:00.170 --> 02:30:03.470
<v Speaker 5>with what was happening in that house.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it was just such a gut instinct that</v>

3614
02:30:03.471 --> 02:30:06.090
<v Speaker 5>it wasn't just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was something fucking.</v>

3615
02:30:06.200 --> 02:30:07.610
<v Speaker 5>I had a friend who,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3616
02:30:07.670 --> 02:30:10.010
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>after he broke up with a girl,</v>

3617
02:30:10.570 --> 02:30:15.570
<v Speaker 5>they stayed in touch and they agreed to </v>
<v Speaker 5>a form of prostitution because she was </v>

3618
02:30:17.331 --> 02:30:18.220
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3619
02:30:18.320 --> 02:30:22.520
<v Speaker 5>she always had like shitty jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She always needed money and she said she</v>

3620
02:30:22.521 --> 02:30:24.590
<v Speaker 5>couldn't have a relationship with him </v>
<v Speaker 5>anymore.</v>

3621
02:30:24.590 --> 02:30:28.250
<v Speaker 5>She was past it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but she would come over and let him fuck</v>

3622
02:30:28.251 --> 02:30:30.860
<v Speaker 5>her or she would suck his dick and he </v>
<v Speaker 5>would give her money.</v>

3623
02:30:30.920 --> 02:30:32.510
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I became,</v>

3624
02:30:32.540 --> 02:30:35.330
<v Speaker 5>became a weird sort of a prostitution </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>

3625
02:30:35.331 --> 02:30:40.331
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it really freaked him out when he was </v>

3626
02:30:40.331 --> 02:30:40.331
<v Speaker 5>telling a story.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

3627
02:30:40.331 --> 02:30:42.560
<v Speaker 5>it started off as like she needed to </v>
<v Speaker 5>borrow money and she asked me and I said</v>

3628
02:30:42.790 --> 02:30:43.850
<v Speaker 5>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>come on over.</v>

3629
02:30:44.180 --> 02:30:48.230
<v Speaker 5>And then somehow or another he gave her </v>
<v Speaker 5>the money and then they fucked,</v>

3630
02:30:48.260 --> 02:30:49.040
<v Speaker 5>like she,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

3631
02:30:49.250 --> 02:30:51.020
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>thanked him by blowing them or something</v>

3632
02:30:51.021 --> 02:30:53.390
<v Speaker 5>like that and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and she said,</v>

3633

<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>something like,</v>

3634
02:30:54.081 --> 02:30:55.640
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we can do this anytime,</v>

3635
02:30:55.920 --> 02:30:57.530
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>anytime you want to do that,</v>

3636
02:30:57.950 --> 02:30:58.970
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as a,</v>

3637
02:30:58.971 --> 02:31:01.250
<v Speaker 5>I always need money,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like joking around.</v>

3638
02:31:01.490 --> 02:31:03.200
<v Speaker 5>And I think he gets grabbed and said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>

3639
02:31:03.440 --> 02:31:04.640
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we don't have to.</v>

3640
02:31:04.940 --> 02:31:06.110
<v Speaker 5>There's nothing wrong with this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll,</v>

<v Speaker 5>come.</v>

3643
02:31:09.530 --> 02:31:11.650
<v Speaker 5>And so like he turned her into his </v>
<v Speaker 5>brain.</v>

3644
02:31:11.740 --> 02:31:13.670
<v Speaker 5>Is that if you're looking for new </v>
<v Speaker 5>clients,</v>

3645
02:31:14.090 --> 02:31:17.450
<v Speaker 5>I would love to have someone who is not </v>
<v Speaker 5>really a prostitute though.</v>

3646
02:31:17.480 --> 02:31:22.480
<v Speaker 5>She's only doing it with her ex and she </v>
<v Speaker 5>says so she says she will fucking branch</v>

3647
02:31:22.861 --> 02:31:26.520
<v Speaker 5>out franchise.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That shit.</v>

3648
02:31:26.560 --> 02:31:27.420
<v Speaker 5>This was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by the way,</v>

3649
02:31:27.421 --> 02:31:31.470
<v Speaker 5>this was over a decade ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>changed her ways,</v>

3650
02:31:31.471 --> 02:31:33.210
<v Speaker 5>but it was a great story when he was </v>
<v Speaker 5>doing it,</v>

3651
02:31:33.211 --> 02:31:35.190
<v Speaker 5>like while it was going down I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

3652
02:31:35.250 --> 02:31:40.250
<v Speaker 5>that is nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I couldn't do it with my ex </v>

3653
02:31:40.250 --> 02:31:42.581
<v Speaker 5>girlfriend cause I loved her too much,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I could do it with girls I've dated </v>

3654
02:31:42.581 --> 02:31:43.320
<v Speaker 5>in my life like any extra effort was </v>
<v Speaker 5>with for a year and a half.</v>

3655
02:31:43.321 --> 02:31:48.321
<v Speaker 5>I could never do that because I would </v>
<v Speaker 5>just feel too sad for them by what if </v>

3656
02:31:48.321 --> 02:31:48.810
<v Speaker 5>it's a real nice exchange.</v>

3657
02:31:48.810 --> 02:31:53.810
<v Speaker 5>Like you don't feel sad for the regular </v>
<v Speaker 5>prostitute that doesn't even know you </v>

3658
02:31:53.810 --> 02:31:54.060
<v Speaker 5>don't want her to feel bad seeing her </v>
<v Speaker 5>and fucking or again,</v>

3659
02:31:54.061 --> 02:31:55.290
<v Speaker 5>that will bring back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3660
02:31:55.380 --> 02:31:57.540
<v Speaker 5>we just couldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would feel too.</v>

3661
02:31:57.550 --> 02:31:58.800
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 5>like corn.</v>

02:33:11.040 --> 02:33:16.040
<v Speaker 5>It was like she hadn't eaten in a month </v>
<v Speaker 5>and it was just a kernel of corn riding </v>

<v Speaker 5>like a use infection,</v>

3704
02:33:51.090 --> 02:33:52.950
<v Speaker 5>like a horrible smelling yeast </v>
<v Speaker 5>infection.</v>

3705
02:33:53.280 --> 02:33:56.910
<v Speaker 5>There's almost something more disgusting</v>
<v Speaker 5>about that smell than a shit smell.</v>

3706
02:33:56.940 --> 02:33:57.510
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Vista.</v>

<v Speaker 5>here?</v>

3713
02:34:11.730 --> 02:34:16.730
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the thing about smells is that </v>

3716
02:34:22.451 --> 02:34:27.451
<v Speaker 5>smells.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why people live in places where </v>

3742
02:35:32.531 --> 02:35:33.980
<v Speaker 5>right now the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who cares?</v>

3743
02:35:34.200 --> 02:35:39.200
<v Speaker 5>I don't fucking right in the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>miles you run a little piss smell to it,</v>

3744
02:35:42.290 --> 02:35:47.290
<v Speaker 5>but shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's where you draw the line a little </v>

3745
02:35:47.290 --> 02:35:47.750
<v Speaker 5>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not a lot,</v>

3746
02:35:48.110 --> 02:35:49.820
<v Speaker 5>but a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's an animal thing,</v>

3747
02:35:49.821 --> 02:35:52.560
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't believe you like the underarms,</v>

3748
02:35:52.580 --> 02:35:54.380
<v Speaker 5>distinct.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a strange thing,</v>

3749
02:35:54.650 --> 02:35:59.650
<v Speaker 5>but it's raw.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I remember like even when I smoked </v>

3750
02:35:59.650 --> 02:35:59.650
<v Speaker 5>my,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3751
02:35:59.650 --> 02:36:01.340
<v Speaker 5>my nose has always been a very vegan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was a kid.</v>

3752
02:36:01.341 --> 02:36:04.400
<v Speaker 5>I used to lay on my back and my friend </v>
<v Speaker 5>and his sister,</v>

3753
02:36:04.401 --> 02:36:09.401
<v Speaker 5>I was in like first grade,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she was in second grade and he was in </v>

3754
02:36:09.401 --> 02:36:09.401
<v Speaker 5>Migraine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She was a year older than us and I would</v>

3755
02:36:09.401 --> 02:36:12.950
<v Speaker 5>get them to sit on my face in their </v>
<v Speaker 5>pants because they both would piss their</v>

3756
02:36:12.951 --> 02:36:15.630
<v Speaker 5>pants a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess they had mortifying home life.</v>

3757
02:36:15.830 --> 02:36:18.110
<v Speaker 5>Apparently somebody yelled a lot in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>house,</v>

3758
02:36:19.160 --> 02:36:24.160
<v Speaker 5>tinkle in their crotch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so I would lay on my back and have </v>

3759
02:36:24.160 --> 02:36:25.700
<v Speaker 5>them fucking put their crotch over my </v>
<v Speaker 5>face and I would smell it.</v>

3760
02:36:25.701 --> 02:36:27.300
<v Speaker 5>I just love the smell.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

3761
02:36:27.530 --> 02:36:28.700
<v Speaker 5>I swear to God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3762
02:36:28.720 --> 02:36:33.720
<v Speaker 5>I remembered that I would lay behind the</v>
<v Speaker 5>shrubs and have the fucking sit on my </v>

3763
02:36:33.720 --> 02:36:34.340
<v Speaker 5>face.</v>

3764
02:36:34.990 --> 02:36:36.550
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I used to do something as a kid.</v>

3765
02:36:36.551 --> 02:36:38.280
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if I told you this before,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I know you're a,</v>

3766
02:36:38.281 --> 02:36:39.770
<v Speaker 6>you love Pete,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I,</v>

3767
02:36:39.820 --> 02:36:44.440
<v Speaker 6>the girl that always wanted me to fuck </v>
<v Speaker 6>her in the shower and then pee inside of</v>

3768
02:36:44.441 --> 02:36:46.440
<v Speaker 6>her because it felt like I was coming in</v>
<v Speaker 6>or,</v>

3769
02:36:46.960 --> 02:36:49.270
<v Speaker 6>and if you ever done that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not</v>

3770
02:36:49.270 --> 02:36:51.200
<v Speaker 5>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't like shower sex because I have,</v>

3771
02:36:51.250 --> 02:36:56.250
<v Speaker 5>I'm so high maintenance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have to be fucking a certain way and </v>

3772
02:36:56.250 --> 02:36:56.340
<v Speaker 5>keys my nipples and it's hard for me to </v>
<v Speaker 5>peanut chick.</v>

3773
02:36:56.560 --> 02:36:57.760
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've pissed on girls,</v>

3774
02:36:57.761 --> 02:36:59.800
<v Speaker 5>but it's hard for me to pee in a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a girl because,</v>

3775
02:36:59.801 --> 02:37:04.801
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just such a different sensation to </v>

3776
02:37:04.801 --> 02:37:06.901
<v Speaker 5>me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I would love to be able to admire </v>

3777
02:37:06.901 --> 02:37:06.901
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>irritates the tip.</v>

3778
02:37:06.901 --> 02:37:09.780
<v Speaker 5>I wonder how many women were listening </v>
<v Speaker 5>to this podcast right up as a point </v>

3779
02:37:09.780 --> 02:37:09.910
<v Speaker 5>where you got to tease my nipples.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

3780
02:37:09.911 --> 02:37:11.290
<v Speaker 5>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>

3781
02:37:11.470 --> 02:37:13.070
<v Speaker 5>I've lost a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm done.</v>

3782
02:37:14.320 --> 02:37:17.120
<v Speaker 5>I can't listen this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you know what,</v>

3783
02:37:17.150 --> 02:37:21.200
<v Speaker 5>I'll tell you what I do and what I say </v>
<v Speaker 5>and I talk about it as they say.</v>

3784
02:37:21.201 --> 02:37:24.950
<v Speaker 5>It weeds out all non hackers who don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>pack the gear to serve my beloved core.</v>

3785
02:37:25.220 --> 02:37:27.920
<v Speaker 5>Anybody who is not going to fucking show</v>
<v Speaker 5>up to play,</v>

3786
02:37:28.250 --> 02:37:33.250
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I probably weed out 90 percent of the </v>

3787
02:37:33.250 --> 02:37:35.681
<v Speaker 5>women that would go out with me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the 10 percent that show up are </v>

3788
02:37:35.681 --> 02:37:35.690
<v Speaker 5>fucking troopers.</v>

<v Speaker 5>it's a weird thing.</v>

3809
02:38:10.551 --> 02:38:14.240
<v Speaker 5>It's a thing that people don't like to </v>
<v Speaker 5>say because you sound like a Douche bag,</v>

3810
02:38:14.500 --> 02:38:15.200
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you say,</v>

<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well I know I'm famous,</v>

3812
02:38:16.461 --> 02:38:21.461
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it sounds gross and it feels gross even </v>

3813
02:38:21.461 --> 02:38:21.461
<v Speaker 5>think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

3814
02:38:21.470 --> 02:38:25.820
<v Speaker 5>but what my point is you are and you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>famous for being a pervert.</v>

3815
02:38:26.030 --> 02:38:31.030
<v Speaker 5>So it's like it's all out on the table.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's not like you might have cut out </v>

3816
02:38:31.030 --> 02:38:33.670
<v Speaker 5>the amount of women that would a date </v>
<v Speaker 5>you buy,</v>

3817
02:38:33.671 --> 02:38:34.910
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>90 percent.</v>

3818
02:38:35.090 --> 02:38:40.090
<v Speaker 5>But those 10 percent you have 57,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>percent more of them.</v>

3819
02:38:40.490 --> 02:38:41.260

<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3822
02:38:42.530 --> 02:38:46.700
<v Speaker 5>The numbers are staggeringly in your </v>
<v Speaker 5>favor because if you were like a regular</v>

3823
02:38:46.701 --> 02:38:49.760
<v Speaker 5>dude that never got famous and kept all </v>
<v Speaker 5>this shit hidden,</v>

3824
02:38:50.240 --> 02:38:55.240
<v Speaker 5>it would be really hard to find exactly </v>
<v Speaker 5>what you're looking for and the ones </v>

3825
02:38:55.240 --> 02:38:55.690
<v Speaker 5>that you lose that are really pretty or </v>
<v Speaker 5>really cool.</v>

3826

<v Speaker 5>fuck man,</v>

3827
02:38:57.591 --> 02:38:59.930
<v Speaker 5>I blow it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's like she would have been,</v>

3828
02:38:59.960 --> 02:39:04.960
<v Speaker 5>we would have had an awful sexual </v>
<v Speaker 5>relationship anyway because I know what </v>

3829
02:39:04.960 --> 02:39:08.051
<v Speaker 5>I like and you don't have to be filthy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you've got to be kind of open and </v>

3830
02:39:08.051 --> 02:39:09.080
<v Speaker 5>willing to at least like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like talking about a lot of stuff that</v>

3831
02:39:09.081 --> 02:39:14.081
<v Speaker 5>I don't like to just sex.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're not hurting anybody feel like </v>

3832

<v Speaker 5>rather be fucking another guy.</v>

3834
02:39:17.660 --> 02:39:20.450
<v Speaker 5>I'd tell them to pretend they don't even</v>
<v Speaker 5>know what a Dick looks like.</v>

3835
02:39:22.280 --> 02:39:23.780

<v Speaker 5>hermetically sealed pouch for 30 years.</v>

3848
02:39:57.831 --> 02:40:01.190
<v Speaker 5>I just on this last tour I did because </v>
<v Speaker 5>I've talked about it so much,</v>

3849
02:40:01.191 --> 02:40:06.191
<v Speaker 5>but I like big pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've always joked about that thick </v>

<v Speaker 5>eighties or the eighties and nineties to</v>

<v Speaker 5>Caitlin.</v>

3857
02:40:17.040 --> 02:40:18.630
<v Speaker 5>Ashley,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think her name was.</v>

3858
02:40:18.840 --> 02:40:20.670
<v Speaker 5>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I forget her last name,</v>

3859
02:40:20.671 --> 02:40:22.800
<v Speaker 5>but she had the biggest pussy.</v>

3860
02:40:22.800 --> 02:40:24.540
<v Speaker 5>Lips.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were ridiculous.</v>

3861
02:40:24.750 --> 02:40:29.750
<v Speaker 5>They were like hands like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they would grab a hold of Dude's </v>

3862
02:40:29.881 --> 02:40:34.881
<v Speaker 5>Dick Blick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at the size of her fucking pussy </v>

3863
02:40:34.881 --> 02:40:35.300
<v Speaker 5>lips and then I had heard from some </v>
<v Speaker 5>something,</v>

3864
02:40:35.301 --> 02:40:40.301
<v Speaker 5>some online,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe it was a stern show that some </v>

3865
02:40:40.301 --> 02:40:41.910
<v Speaker 5>women get their lobbyists.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Labor reduction.</v>

3866
02:40:41.911 --> 02:40:44.700
<v Speaker 5>I think that was doctor should be </v>
<v Speaker 5>targeted like fucking abortion doctors.</v>

3867
02:40:44.701 --> 02:40:47.550
<v Speaker 5>I hate those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was kind of uplifting women.</v>

3868
02:40:47.820 --> 02:40:50.520
<v Speaker 5>Those poor women that think that there's</v>
<v Speaker 5>anything wrong with that.</v>

3869
02:40:50.610 --> 02:40:51.990
<v Speaker 5>Like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It feels good,</v>

3870
02:40:51.991 --> 02:40:54.330
<v Speaker 5>all that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all that is just more pussy.</v>

3871
02:40:54.331 --> 02:40:59.331
<v Speaker 5>It's more lips.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't get it wrong with it and I </v>

3872
02:40:59.331 --> 02:41:00.090
<v Speaker 5>try and I say that it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but women do appreciate that.</v>

3873
02:41:00.091 --> 02:41:02.970
<v Speaker 5>Like the fact that I take that stand and</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm really dirty about it,</v>

3874
02:41:02.971 --> 02:41:05.910
<v Speaker 5>but it's like they really do appreciate </v>
<v Speaker 5>the fact that your body.</v>

3875
02:41:05.911 --> 02:41:06.960
<v Speaker 5>I love it.</v>

<v Speaker 5>to be put in a locker,</v>

3884

<v Speaker 5>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

3887
02:41:31.500 --> 02:41:36.500
<v Speaker 5>I worked with this chick once and she </v>
<v Speaker 5>was a very funny and very open and she </v>

3888
02:41:37.311 --> 02:41:42.311
<v Speaker 5>was talking about her ex boyfriend that </v>
<v Speaker 5>her ex boyfriend had before you had met </v>

3889
02:41:42.311 --> 02:41:46.431
<v Speaker 5>her,</v>
<v Speaker 5>had hooked up with this woman they were </v>

3890
02:41:46.431 --> 02:41:48.861
<v Speaker 5>making out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were getting all hot and heavy and </v>

3891
02:41:48.861 --> 02:41:49.560
<v Speaker 5>then when he pulled her pants down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>her clit was like really long,</v>

3892
02:41:49.920 --> 02:41:52.470
<v Speaker 5>like absurdly long,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a small thumb.</v>

3893
02:41:52.590 --> 02:41:57.590
<v Speaker 5>It was just like any panicked and she </v>
<v Speaker 5>responded like she knew that,</v>

3894
02:41:58.090 --> 02:42:00.060
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>other guys had probably already panicked</v>

3895
02:42:00.660 --> 02:42:04.530
<v Speaker 5>and he made up some story about needing </v>
<v Speaker 5>to go to the airport for getting to pick</v>

3896
02:42:04.531 --> 02:42:06.840
<v Speaker 5>up his brother.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey ran out of her.</v>

3897
02:42:07.890 --> 02:42:08.970
<v Speaker 5>He saw her,</v>
<v Speaker 5>her,</v>

<v Speaker 5>her,</v>
<v Speaker 5>her Dick Pussy and just ran out.</v>

3899
02:42:11.900 --> 02:42:16.900

<v Speaker 5>was so drunk once that I was eating a </v>

3900
02:42:16.900 --> 02:42:20.841
<v Speaker 5>girl out and suck her lips.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It would go out so far that I kind of </v>

3901
02:42:20.841 --> 02:42:25.551
<v Speaker 5>thought maybe she,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was a like a bad penis or something </v>

3902
02:42:25.551 --> 02:42:25.551
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like yeah,</v>

3903
02:42:25.551 --> 02:42:29.990
<v Speaker 5>like it was under foreign penis or </v>
<v Speaker 5>something and so I had to like turn on </v>

3904
02:42:29.990 --> 02:42:30.210
<v Speaker 5>the light a little and look at it </v>
<v Speaker 5>because it was so.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I mean it was that long coke zero.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's stretched out like fucking came in </v>

<v Speaker 5>Like I would never be mad.</v>

3908
02:42:43.890 --> 02:42:46.950
<v Speaker 5>I had a woman walk up and go like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have what you like,</v>

3909
02:42:47.520 --> 02:42:51.680

<v Speaker 5>Then it was just,</v>

3910
02:42:51.720 --> 02:42:56.100
<v Speaker 5>it was a fucking giant pack.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It looks like an octopus.</v>

3911
02:42:56.160 --> 02:42:56.710
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dude.</v>

3912
02:42:56.720 --> 02:43:01.720
<v Speaker 5>It was like indefinable,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you wouldn't know what it was if </v>

3913
02:43:01.720 --> 02:43:01.830
<v Speaker 5>somebody just showed you a picture of it</v>
<v Speaker 5>without a woman attack.</v>

3914
02:43:02.530 --> 02:43:07.530
<v Speaker 5>Fuck is that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'd have no idea if they get a bunch </v>

3915
02:43:07.530 --> 02:43:08.090
<v Speaker 5>of things thrown somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How bad was it?</v>

3916

<v Speaker 5>The best one I've seen in one of them.</v>

3918
02:43:11.891 --> 02:43:16.891
<v Speaker 5>One one was a dominatrix.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I only saw a couple of times many years </v>

3919
02:43:16.891 --> 02:43:19.900
<v Speaker 5>ago and one was a massage therapist who </v>
<v Speaker 5>was massaging me,</v>

3920
02:43:19.901 --> 02:43:24.901
<v Speaker 5>probably 2002 and I was on my back and </v>
<v Speaker 5>she had shorts and I had convinced her </v>

3921
02:43:24.901 --> 02:43:26.020
<v Speaker 5>to go over my face so I could look at </v>
<v Speaker 5>her ass.</v>

3922
02:43:26.350 --> 02:43:30.280
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know her pussy and she,</v>
<v Speaker 5>her legs parted and I saw her pussy.</v>

3923
02:43:30.610 --> 02:43:34.510
<v Speaker 5>It was literally a fucking belly button </v>
<v Speaker 5>to the spine.</v>

3924
02:43:34.900 --> 02:43:38.200
<v Speaker 5>It was the holy grail.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I lost my breath.</v>

3925
02:43:38.710 --> 02:43:41.730
<v Speaker 5>I lost my belly button.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You probably choking on it,</v>

3926
02:43:41.740 --> 02:43:42.460
<v Speaker 5>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I fucked.</v>

3927
02:43:42.461 --> 02:43:43.480
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she wouldn't let me do anything.</v>

3928
02:43:43.840 --> 02:43:45.760
<v Speaker 5>Eventually she let me lick it and smell </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

3929
02:43:45.761 --> 02:43:46.970
<v Speaker 5>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it would always snap,</v>

3930
02:43:47.440 --> 02:43:49.390
<v Speaker 5>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was fucking awesome.</v>

3931
02:43:51.220 --> 02:43:53.000
<v Speaker 5>We would always fight money when she </v>
<v Speaker 5>would come over,</v>

3932
02:43:53.001 --> 02:43:58.001
<v Speaker 5>but she got too greedy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like if she had just thank God she </v>

3933
02:43:58.001 --> 02:43:58.450
<v Speaker 5>didn't know she could have owned the </v>
<v Speaker 5>whole franchise.</v>

3934
02:43:58.600 --> 02:43:59.400
<v Speaker 5>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Would've signed that.</v>

3935
02:43:59.410 --> 02:44:00.400
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is before I owned my place,</v>

3936
02:44:00.401 --> 02:44:02.470
<v Speaker 5>but I would have given her my rent </v>
<v Speaker 5>money.</v>

3937
02:44:02.471 --> 02:44:04.740
<v Speaker 5>Like literally she could have owned me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>still new,</v>

3938
02:44:05.170 --> 02:44:10.170
<v Speaker 5>but she will always get mad and want </v>
<v Speaker 5>more money and the greed would turn me </v>

3939
02:44:10.170 --> 02:44:10.170
<v Speaker 5>off because it was unreasonable.</v>

3940
02:44:10.170 --> 02:44:13.160
<v Speaker 5>I felt it was unreasonable,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but her fucking pussy man,</v>

3974
02:45:09.231 --> 02:45:11.200
<v Speaker 5>he's not even sentenced yet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it's still a,</v>

02:45:11.350 --> 02:45:12.460
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we'll still feel fresh.</v>

<v Speaker 5>just a mad scramble now to make up the </v>

3978
02:45:19.330 --> 02:45:20.260
<v Speaker 5>next hour.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's exciting though,</v>

3979
02:45:20.261 --> 02:45:21.250
<v Speaker 5>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love it,</v>

3980
02:45:21.251 --> 02:45:23.140
<v Speaker 5>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love it because I can go on,</v>

3981
02:45:23.141 --> 02:45:26.230
<v Speaker 5>like I said at the seller and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>talking about the Travolta stuff and all</v>

3982
02:45:26.231 --> 02:45:31.231
<v Speaker 5>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then you find this stuff that's topical </v>

3983
02:45:31.231 --> 02:45:31.231
<v Speaker 5>where you have to weed it out because it</v>
<v Speaker 5>feels too time sensitive.</v>

3984
02:45:31.540 --> 02:45:33.350
<v Speaker 5>Like if I talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I talked about tiger,</v>

3985
02:45:33.380 --> 02:45:38.380
<v Speaker 5>my special a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the two points I hit on were so </v>

3986
02:45:38.380 --> 02:45:38.470

<v Speaker 5>to be cut,</v>

3988
02:45:41.320 --> 02:45:43.270
<v Speaker 5>so now I'm in that process with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Travolta Shit,</v>

3989
02:45:43.271 --> 02:45:48.271
<v Speaker 5>like it's already out of the news so I </v>
<v Speaker 5>got to take a couple of moments that </v>

<v Speaker 5>will feel good in six months and just </v>
<v Speaker 5>make them part of the act.</v>

4127
02:51:58.991 --> 02:52:01.230
<v Speaker 5>Steve Martin actually called me out on </v>
<v Speaker 5>bashing him and fucking.</v>

4128
02:52:01.530 --> 02:52:02.720
<v Speaker 5>Are you seeing mostly?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4129
02:52:02.730 --> 02:52:06.130
<v Speaker 5>I was doing a tonight show a bit for the</v>
<v Speaker 5>and Steve Martin</v>

4130
02:52:06.130 --> 02:52:08.110
<v Speaker 1>and his band came up and I'm like I said</v>
<v Speaker 1>to my project,</v>

4131
02:52:08.140 --> 02:52:13.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he'll talk to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't recognize my face when he </v>

4132
02:52:13.140 --> 02:52:16.021
<v Speaker 1>saw my name on the CD goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You said some very unkind things about </v>

4133
02:52:16.021 --> 02:52:17.080
<v Speaker 1>me in your book and I actually felt </v>
<v Speaker 1>really bad.</v>

4134
02:52:17.130 --> 02:52:19.090
<v Speaker 1>What did he say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What'd you say about I just trashed them</v>

4135
02:52:19.091 --> 02:52:22.300
<v Speaker 1>for doing the Pink Panther,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the book was about targeting fucking</v>

4136
02:52:22.420 --> 02:52:27.420
<v Speaker 1>Sharpton and Jesse Jackson and Keith </v>
<v Speaker 1>Olbermann who I thought turned on Ims </v>

4137
02:52:27.420 --> 02:52:27.420
<v Speaker 1>for language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was about that shit.</v>

4138
02:52:27.420 --> 02:52:29.890
<v Speaker 1>So I had missed misguided anger towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve Martin.</v>

4139
02:52:30.040 --> 02:52:31.990
<v Speaker 1>I should have made fun of them and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't have been as mean.</v>

4140
02:52:31.991 --> 02:52:34.360
<v Speaker 1>And I actually did feel bad about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard.</v>

4141
02:52:34.450 --> 02:52:38.050
<v Speaker 1>It's hard when you've got to face.</v>

<v Speaker 1>she's so nice.</v>

4144
02:52:43.051 --> 02:52:43.600
<v Speaker 1>I stopped doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4145
