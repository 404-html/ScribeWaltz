<v Speaker 1>The research cause well your podcasts,</v>

24
00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:06.920
<v Speaker 1>much like Dan Carlin's is very </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

25
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:07.793
<v Speaker 1>I always feel ashamed calling my podcast</v>
<v Speaker 1>a podcast cause it's just you sit down </v>

26
00:01:11.511 --> 00:01:13.070
<v Speaker 1>and talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yours is like,</v>

27
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:14.623
<v Speaker 1>it's an audio lesson on history and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>depth audio lesson on like very extreme </v>

28
00:01:20.271 --> 00:01:21.850
<v Speaker 1>aspects of history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

29
00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:22.713
<v Speaker 1>It gets and you know that part I enjoy </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the storytelling part is </v>

30
00:01:25.761 --> 00:01:26.594
<v Speaker 1>awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got a penis story and make it </v>

31
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.220
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] connected with pop culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do something that's fun.</v>

32
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.900
<v Speaker 1>That's the part that I love is the month</v>
<v Speaker 1>prior to that of just brutal research.</v>

33
00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:36.763
<v Speaker 1>Just call them been through boring </v>
<v Speaker 1>historical book after boring historical </v>

34
00:01:39.831 --> 00:01:42.290
<v Speaker 1>books to find those little nuggets that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are amazing.</v>

35
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then spin it into a narrative that's</v>

36
00:01:46.041 --> 00:01:48.890
<v Speaker 1>the power deck gets a lethal old </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes where you're like,</v>

37
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.940
<v Speaker 1>man I do I really need to read 200 hours</v>
<v Speaker 1>of stuff for this one thing.</v>

38
00:01:52.941 --> 00:01:54.680
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

39
00:01:54.681 --> 00:01:57.440
<v Speaker 1>I can only imagine now when you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're going over,</v>

40
00:01:57.441 --> 00:01:58.274
<v Speaker 1>combing over all these different uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>history books and all these different </v>

41
00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.920
<v Speaker 1>papers written on various times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you,</v>

42
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.053
<v Speaker 1>are you like extracting chunks and like </v>
<v Speaker 1>putting them in Microsoft word and then </v>

43
00:02:08.421 --> 00:02:10.940
<v Speaker 1>going over it and then like how did you </v>
<v Speaker 1>form it?</v>

44
00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:11.803
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the question is kind of like do form it </v>

45
00:02:12.711 --> 00:02:16.780
<v Speaker 1>as a script or how much of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so everything is completely written out.</v>

46
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.510
<v Speaker 1>Not exactly because otherwise then it </v>
<v Speaker 1>sound like it sound like yard guy.</v>

47
00:02:20.511 --> 00:02:23.090
<v Speaker 1>You're getting a seeing and gets boring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't sound right.</v>

48
00:02:23.091 --> 00:02:23.924
<v Speaker 1>I just take super extensive notes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of like if you are to give a </v>

49
00:02:27.351 --> 00:02:30.860
<v Speaker 1>lecture that you have never given,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not gonna sit down and read it by</v>

<v Speaker 1>you are going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

51
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.420
<v Speaker 1>you have something to keep you on track </v>
<v Speaker 1>to make sure it's like,</v>

52
00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:36.440
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

55
00:02:42.141 --> 00:02:46.850
<v Speaker 1>without turning a team to a dry guy or </v>
<v Speaker 1>he Denise Page type of stuff.</v>

56

57
00:02:51.051 --> 00:02:51.884

<v Speaker 2>like if we only had our current era and </v>

62
00:03:08.501 --> 00:03:11.260
<v Speaker 2>we're looking around how fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>maniacal people are,</v>

63
00:03:11.261 --> 00:03:13.090
<v Speaker 2>how crazy the world is.</v>

<v Speaker 2>how'd this happen?</v>

65
00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.400
<v Speaker 2>How did we get here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you just listen to your podcast</v>

66
00:03:18.401 --> 00:03:19.211
<v Speaker 2>and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>there's much we can do better without a </v>
<v Speaker 2>doubt,</v>

72
00:03:32.351 --> 00:03:35.410
<v Speaker 2>ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is as fucking good as it's ever</v>

73
00:03:35.411 --> 00:03:37.300
<v Speaker 2>been by far.</v>

74
00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:38.443
<v Speaker 1>The human psyche is a very weird place </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's so much amazing stuff </v>

75
00:03:42.351 --> 00:03:45.500
<v Speaker 1>that human beings don't are just so much</v>
<v Speaker 1>and vendors,</v>

76
00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:46.813
<v Speaker 1>the amount of horror that can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>unleashed throughout that has been </v>

77
00:03:49.641 --> 00:03:52.130
<v Speaker 1>unleashed throughout history by people </v>
<v Speaker 1>against other people.</v>

78
00:03:52.131 --> 00:03:54.110
<v Speaker 1>Is it just insane?</v>

79
00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is like when you go back and you,</v>

80
00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.360
<v Speaker 2>you go over history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the most confusing or disturbing</v>

81
00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.223
<v Speaker 2>era?</v>

82
00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:03.343
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I to me is not so much at Bharti Kohler </v>

83
00:04:05.671 --> 00:04:06.504
<v Speaker 1>period because the same bathrooms and </v>
<v Speaker 1>merge a lot of the times at different </v>

84
00:04:09.991 --> 00:04:12.340
<v Speaker 1>point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ease is more,</v>

85
00:04:12.341 --> 00:04:13.500
<v Speaker 1>it was moments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

86
00:04:13.501 --> 00:04:14.334
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

87
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:15.713
<v Speaker 1>when mob mentality takes over because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the reality is the average person is </v>

88
00:04:18.721 --> 00:04:19.554
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have the award of view where I </v>

89
00:04:20.821 --> 00:04:23.430
<v Speaker 1>think the average person is evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that,</v>

90
00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.660
<v Speaker 1>I think the average person is weak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means that when a inequity nations</v>

91
00:04:27.661 --> 00:04:28.494
<v Speaker 1>where everybody's pushing in one </v>
<v Speaker 1>direction is very easy to jump on the </v>

92
00:04:30.841 --> 00:04:31.674
<v Speaker 1>bandwagon and in some cases then a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>ordinary human being can do horrible </v>

93
00:04:36.211 --> 00:04:37.044
<v Speaker 1>actions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You meet them for dinner and you think </v>

94
00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.930
<v Speaker 1>pleasant person good enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you put them in the wrong context.</v>

95
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.150
<v Speaker 1>And devotee scene turns to shit I just </v>
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>

96
00:04:45.151 --> 00:04:45.984
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just finished right now it is to </v>

97
00:04:47.491 --> 00:04:49.620
<v Speaker 1>perceive it is less,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably the most disturbing.</v>

98
00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.190
<v Speaker 1>I now I want to what podcast about </v>
<v Speaker 1>flowers and puppies because this one was</v>

99
00:04:53.191 --> 00:04:54.024
<v Speaker 1>heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

100
00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:55.493
<v Speaker 1>I need this [inaudible] kind of compare </v>
<v Speaker 1>and contrast on the sand creek massacre </v>

101
00:04:59.551 --> 00:05:00.384
<v Speaker 1>of the Cheyenne in Colorado in the 1860s</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then me lie in Vietnam in 1968 and </v>

102
00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.320
<v Speaker 1>actually they split it because I had id </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sand creek and they had,</v>

103
00:05:10.321 --> 00:05:11.131
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy,</v>

104
00:05:11.131 --> 00:05:14.630
<v Speaker 1>Daryl Cooper was the martyrmade podcast </v>
<v Speaker 1>is an amazing podcast or,</v>

105
00:05:14.631 --> 00:05:17.090
<v Speaker 1>and he covered me lie and dining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The third APP is,</v>

106
00:05:17.091 --> 00:05:20.490
<v Speaker 1>or we're going to sit down and kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>chat about what does this all mean about</v>

107
00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:21.593
<v Speaker 1>the human nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do the reason why that particular </v>

108
00:05:25.891 --> 00:05:28.980
<v Speaker 1>story in those two stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interest means because it's um,</v>

109
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:29.963
<v Speaker 1>too brutal massacre of civilians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in both cases that are solely or </v>

110
00:05:32.811 --> 00:05:36.000
<v Speaker 1>should refuse to participate or actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to stop it.</v>

111
00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.400
<v Speaker 1>They're not the majority there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>minority,</v>

112
00:05:38.401 --> 00:05:39.810
<v Speaker 1>but they are there and they try.</v>

113
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.900
<v Speaker 1>So it's not just a story of people doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>ugly stuff.</v>

114
00:05:42.901 --> 00:05:43.734
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is that make one guy when all </v>

115
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:48.330
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey go shoot that three year old,</v>

116
00:05:48.331 --> 00:05:49.470
<v Speaker 1>the one guy goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes sir,</v>

117
00:05:49.471 --> 00:05:51.720
<v Speaker 1>and does it and the next guy goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

118
00:05:51.721 --> 00:05:53.130
<v Speaker 1>that's not what we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Screw you.</v>

119
00:05:53.131 --> 00:05:53.964
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what interests me is like the </v>

120
00:05:56.071 --> 00:05:56.904
<v Speaker 1>individual element.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What make people in the exact same </v>

121
00:05:58.911 --> 00:05:59.744
<v Speaker 1>circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One person go down a really dark path </v>

122
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.820
<v Speaker 1>than somebody else instead of having the</v>
<v Speaker 1>balls to say no,</v>

123
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:05.683
<v Speaker 1>that's not what I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not what we do with the native </v>

124
00:06:07.131 --> 00:06:08.390
<v Speaker 1>American masker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

125
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:09.253
<v Speaker 1>who was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many people were the ones that </v>

126
00:06:10.131 --> 00:06:11.780
<v Speaker 1>refused?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause you never hear about that.</v>

127
00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:12.643
<v Speaker 1>Oh you hear about it's the horrific </v>
<v Speaker 1>actions of the soldiers and which was </v>

128
00:06:15.591 --> 00:06:17.270
<v Speaker 1>the majority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there was also like,</v>

129
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.540
<v Speaker 1>there was this one guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

130
00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.260
<v Speaker 1>what's the guy who named Sila Sila soul.</v>

131
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.580
<v Speaker 1>He was told about the guy with balls of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fire and cause the guy,</v>

132
00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:29.530
<v Speaker 1>he and the capital of other officers or </v>
<v Speaker 1>refuse to let the man and them,</v>

133
00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.400
<v Speaker 1>cause they were divided in different </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies.</v>

134
00:06:31.401 --> 00:06:32.234
<v Speaker 1>So their companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say no or not participating in </v>

135
00:06:34.881 --> 00:06:36.240
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is just straight up slow.</v>

136
00:06:36.241 --> 00:06:38.090
<v Speaker 1>They're these guys that are not even a </v>
<v Speaker 1>real targets.</v>

137
00:06:38.091 --> 00:06:41.460
<v Speaker 1>These are a bunch of civilians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So day or a fuse.</v>

138
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:46.200
<v Speaker 1>And then a silas sold testified against </v>
<v Speaker 1>his commander at the inquiry and,</v>

139
00:06:46.201 --> 00:06:48.340
<v Speaker 1>and he was promptly murder shortly after</v>
<v Speaker 1>noon.</v>

140
00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.270
<v Speaker 1>So he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a crazy story,</v>

141
00:06:50.271 --> 00:06:51.104
<v Speaker 1>but still to this day that are people </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the Cheyenne tribe who every year </v>

142
00:06:53.811 --> 00:06:56.150
<v Speaker 1>they have a ceremony for Silas soul </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they say,</v>

143
00:06:56.151 --> 00:06:59.960
<v Speaker 1>I need not being for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot more of us would have died on that</v>

144
00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:00.793
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he did that really brave thing and </v>

145
00:07:03.141 --> 00:07:04.220
<v Speaker 1>paid the price for it.</v>

146
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:06.470
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're looking for heroism,</v>

147
00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:07.453
<v Speaker 1>you can do a lot worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't look at this guy story because </v>

148
00:07:09.171 --> 00:07:11.330
<v Speaker 1>that guy was seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

149
00:07:11.331 --> 00:07:14.540
<v Speaker 1>stand up for his conviction on their </v>
<v Speaker 1>most extreme circumstances.</v>

150
00:07:14.541 --> 00:07:15.374
<v Speaker 1>So it kind of top of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I admire that dad had to be incredibly </v>

151
00:07:18.441 --> 00:07:23.330
<v Speaker 1>difficult to just imagine what those </v>
<v Speaker 1>people were doing.</v>

152
00:07:23.331 --> 00:07:24.164
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you hear some of the accounts of </v>

153
00:07:24.951 --> 00:07:25.784
<v Speaker 1>the slaughters of native Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just terrifying that people can </v>

154
00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:33.980
<v Speaker 1>just look at someone and just decide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not a person or that's not us.</v>

155
00:07:33.981 --> 00:07:36.710
<v Speaker 1>This is the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've got to be eliminated.</v>

156
00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:39.620
<v Speaker 1>So we're just going to kill all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids and kill all these women.</v>

157
00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:44.720
<v Speaker 1>And it's happened all over the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>

158
00:07:44.721 --> 00:07:46.520
<v Speaker 1>there's two things that happened to </v>
<v Speaker 1>native Americans.</v>

159
00:07:46.521 --> 00:07:49.280
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big one is disease.</v>

160
00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:50.870
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And wasn't on purpose.</v>

161
00:07:50.871 --> 00:07:51.704
<v Speaker 1>There's this big myth that people put,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they put smallpox and blankets and </v>

162
00:07:57.501 --> 00:07:58.670
<v Speaker 1>that's all bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

163
00:07:58.940 --> 00:07:59.773
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty much been proven that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't really understand bacteria or </v>

164
00:08:02.781 --> 00:08:03.614
<v Speaker 1>diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's one story that's a possible is </v>

165
00:08:06.231 --> 00:08:07.064
<v Speaker 1>not a proven thing during,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause initially nobody understood </v>

166
00:08:09.801 --> 00:08:10.634
<v Speaker 1>bacteria and these or the first hand </v>
<v Speaker 1>that plessy are completely </v>

167
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:14.383
<v Speaker 1>unintentional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's one tale about the French and </v>

168
00:08:16.251 --> 00:08:20.000
<v Speaker 1>Indian war where during a break,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Bdt Shar talking about it saying one</v>

169
00:08:20.001 --> 00:08:21.080
<v Speaker 1>of the commander saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

170
00:08:21.081 --> 00:08:23.930
<v Speaker 1>maybe we should give them some blankets </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the smallpox hospital.</v>

171
00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:27.410
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while we do know that he suggested it,</v>

172
00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:30.260
<v Speaker 1>we have no proof whatsoever that he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually done.</v>

173
00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:31.293
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's probably how the rumor got </v>

174
00:08:32.511 --> 00:08:33.260
<v Speaker 1>started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

175
00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:34.093
<v Speaker 1>Problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in most cases would happen is just </v>

176
00:08:36.381 --> 00:08:37.214
<v Speaker 1>that the Europeans came over and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>inadvertently introduced native </v>

177
00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:44.300
<v Speaker 1>Americans diseases and 90% of them were </v>
<v Speaker 1>wiped out.</v>

178
00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:45.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a crazy number.</v>

179
00:08:45.951 --> 00:08:46.784
<v Speaker 1>If you really stop to think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to see they're probably the </v>

180
00:08:49.341 --> 00:08:53.570
<v Speaker 1>most dramatic demographic disaster in </v>
<v Speaker 1>human history because you know,</v>

181
00:08:53.571 --> 00:08:54.980
<v Speaker 1>I've never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before you had a,</v>

182
00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:56.160
<v Speaker 1>where a whole</v>

183
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.010
<v Speaker 2>continent was not exposed to a series of</v>
<v Speaker 2>diseases.</v>

184
00:08:59.011 --> 00:09:01.540
<v Speaker 2>And so of course there's no immunity the</v>
<v Speaker 2>first time they're exposed.</v>

185
00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:02.311
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

186
00:09:02.311 --> 00:09:03.144
<v Speaker 2>you don't need to even have smallpox of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Cannes needs on somebody and the next </v>

187
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:06.870
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>half of the villages that,</v>

188
00:09:06.871 --> 00:09:07.704
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

189
00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:08.790
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

190
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.600
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing that if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

191
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:15.000
<v Speaker 2>a group of people just has not come in </v>
<v Speaker 2>contact with something that other people</v>

192
00:09:15.001 --> 00:09:18.180
<v Speaker 2>come in contact with all the time and </v>
<v Speaker 2>just God with you got a cold,</v>

193
00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:20.010
<v Speaker 2>you'd be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just have some chicken soup,</v>

194
00:09:20.011 --> 00:09:21.180
<v Speaker 2>take a nap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>

195
00:09:21.181 --> 00:09:23.670
<v Speaker 2>these people are just dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty sales them off.</v>

196
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:25.500
<v Speaker 2>That's probably why aliens don't show </v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

197
00:09:25.501 --> 00:09:26.334
<v Speaker 2>It's like those motherfuckers are dirty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If maybe show up these needle nose and </v>

198
00:09:29.791 --> 00:09:31.680
<v Speaker 2>we will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our whole planet will die.</v>

199
00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:33.680
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They know they'll kill us.</v>

200
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.180
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they have like some super advanced</v>
<v Speaker 2>diseases.</v>

201
00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:37.530
<v Speaker 2>That's the other posts to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

202
00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:40.020
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's just a immune system thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

203
00:09:40.021 --> 00:09:41.820
<v Speaker 2>If your immune system is not prepared </v>
<v Speaker 2>for it.</v>

204
00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:43.103
<v Speaker 2>So it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a great book by a guy named Dan </v>

205
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:46.890
<v Speaker 2>Flores.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

206
00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:49.260
<v Speaker 2>well he wrote two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one of them actually,</v>

207
00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:50.563
<v Speaker 2>actually it was a paper that he wrote </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the buffalo and he saying that </v>

208
00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:56.813
<v Speaker 2>it's really interesting because he </v>
<v Speaker 2>compares the initial and counters that </v>

209
00:10:01.261 --> 00:10:04.860
<v Speaker 2>European settlers had and European </v>
<v Speaker 2>travelers had,</v>

210
00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:05.783
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before the native Americans were wiped </v>

211
00:10:07.471 --> 00:10:08.304
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they talk about how many animals </v>

212
00:10:10.861 --> 00:10:13.230
<v Speaker 2>were on the planes and they make it a </v>
<v Speaker 2>direct account of it.</v>

213
00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:15.990
<v Speaker 2>And then after the Europeans had come </v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

214
00:10:15.991 --> 00:10:18.300
<v Speaker 2>90% of the native Americans had been </v>
<v Speaker 2>wiped out.</v>

215
00:10:18.301 --> 00:10:19.134
<v Speaker 2>And that's when the buffalo population </v>
<v Speaker 2>increased goes through the roof and </v>

216
00:10:22.321 --> 00:10:26.540
<v Speaker 2>you're seeing these gigantic packs of </v>
<v Speaker 2>mill wouldn't be packed.</v>

217
00:10:26.541 --> 00:10:27.480
<v Speaker 2>So it hurts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess,</v>

218
00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:29.880
<v Speaker 2>of millions and millions of Buffalo.</v>

219
00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:33.510
<v Speaker 2>And he said that's directly attributed </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the lack of predators,</v>

220
00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:34.643
<v Speaker 2>which means lack of native Americans </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they were preying on these </v>

221
00:10:37.561 --> 00:10:38.460
<v Speaker 2>buffalo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

222
00:10:38.461 --> 00:10:39.510
<v Speaker 2>Really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

223
00:10:39.511 --> 00:10:41.070
<v Speaker 2>That guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had him on the podcast ones,</v>

224
00:10:41.071 --> 00:10:41.850
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

225
00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:43.710
<v Speaker 2>I get them on again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that guy.</v>

226
00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.030
<v Speaker 2>That was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Book,</v>

227
00:10:45.031 --> 00:10:45.864
<v Speaker 2>Coyote America Dumbo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That book changed the way I feel about </v>

228
00:10:49.111 --> 00:10:49.944
<v Speaker 2>coyotes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

229
00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:50.761
<v Speaker 2>I used to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

230
00:10:50.761 --> 00:10:51.594
<v Speaker 2>those little rats will run them over and</v>
<v Speaker 2>now I'm like those little wolves and </v>

231
00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:56.250
<v Speaker 2>they're pretty bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

232
00:10:56.251 --> 00:10:57.940
<v Speaker 2>That was a great type.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that I enjoyed that one.</v>

233
00:10:57.941 --> 00:10:59.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did they're so gangster.</v>

234
00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:03.780
<v Speaker 2>One just stared me down the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I stopped my fucking car and uh,</v>

235
00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:04.471
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

236
00:11:04.471 --> 00:11:06.540
<v Speaker 2>because he was in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a kind of a,</v>

237
00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:08.890
<v Speaker 2>not a lot of people in this area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

238
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:09.943
<v Speaker 2>it was fairly late at night and he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>on this road of someone just pull over </v>

239
00:11:12.961 --> 00:11:13.794
<v Speaker 2>and just see what this coyote does and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he just fuck it stood like 30 feet from </v>

240
00:11:16.561 --> 00:11:19.350
<v Speaker 2>my car just staring at me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just staring at me.</v>

241
00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.430
<v Speaker 2>That's bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

242
00:11:20.431 --> 00:11:21.630
<v Speaker 2>They're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

243
00:11:21.631 --> 00:11:22.640
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you going to do?</v>

244
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:23.543
<v Speaker 2>I'm about to run into these woods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You never get to see me again or I'll </v>

245
00:11:25.681 --> 00:11:27.390
<v Speaker 2>stick around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe if you fuck up,</v>

246
00:11:27.391 --> 00:11:28.320
<v Speaker 2>I'll eat you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

247
00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:31.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm just trying to figure out what to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>right here.</v>

248
00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:35.880
<v Speaker 2>Those guys don't mess around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy that they just can live and</v>

249
00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:41.040
<v Speaker 2>be completely embedded in our society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there we had a biologist,</v>

250
00:11:41.041 --> 00:11:41.874
<v Speaker 2>what was the gentleman's name that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>had from the Department of Parks and </v>

251
00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:47.880
<v Speaker 2>services?</v>
<v Speaker 2>See if we find this guy.</v>

252
00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:49.043
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's actually a biologist who tracks </v>

253
00:11:51.361 --> 00:11:52.194
<v Speaker 2>coyotes and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he tracks them all over the state and </v>

254
00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:56.463
<v Speaker 2>even tracks mountain lions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They tag them and put those collars on </v>

255
00:11:58.751 --> 00:11:59.830
<v Speaker 2>them and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

256
00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:01.630
<v Speaker 2>but he said that there's a pack of </v>
<v Speaker 2>coyotes.</v>

257
00:12:01.631 --> 00:12:02.464
<v Speaker 2>It lives in downtown La.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I believe it in the heat of </v>

258
00:12:04.811 --> 00:12:05.644
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they found some abandoned building and </v>

259
00:12:07.721 --> 00:12:10.960
<v Speaker 2>they dented up in this abandoned </v>
<v Speaker 2>building and that's where they live.</v>

260
00:12:10.961 --> 00:12:14.050
<v Speaker 2>Like how those guys that are resilient,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they thrive in anything.</v>

261
00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:15.790
<v Speaker 2>They thrive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

262
00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:17.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like crazy animal stories.</v>

263
00:12:17.961 --> 00:12:19.820
<v Speaker 1>So check this out about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] there's,</v>

264
00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:23.810
<v Speaker 1>my mom went for a walk with their dog </v>
<v Speaker 1>and their dog is a big mean dog,</v>

265
00:12:23.811 --> 00:12:25.250
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they are walking in,</v>

266
00:12:25.251 --> 00:12:26.084
<v Speaker 1>they see ahead of them and he's lethal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Garp early 10 years old with this tiny </v>

267
00:12:29.481 --> 00:12:34.481
<v Speaker 1>little five pound dog type of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a coyote maybe like 20 yards</v>

268
00:12:34.641 --> 00:12:36.470
<v Speaker 1>behind there that's clearly stalking </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

269
00:12:36.471 --> 00:12:37.304
<v Speaker 1>And the garden didn't see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's obviously aiming for the five </v>

270
00:12:39.981 --> 00:12:42.470
<v Speaker 1>pounder and his just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so my mom yelled at,</v>

271
00:12:42.471 --> 00:12:42.981
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

272
00:12:42.981 --> 00:12:46.040
<v Speaker 1>watch outs or the girl freaks out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pick up the her dog.</v>

273
00:12:46.041 --> 00:12:48.320
<v Speaker 1>And she figured if she saved coyote </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't get a fuck,</v>

274
00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:49.163
<v Speaker 1>she still stalking them down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so at that point my mom kind of let </v>

275
00:12:52.341 --> 00:12:55.430
<v Speaker 1>their dog ago and a dog chase the coyote</v>
<v Speaker 1>off and that was that.</v>

276
00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:57.680
<v Speaker 1>But I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

277
00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:59.050
<v Speaker 1>those guys are don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

278
00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:00.480
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to leave leave.</v>

279
00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:02.870
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to do little girls </v>
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>

280
00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:03.803
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like why a 10 year old is walking </v>

281
00:13:05.151 --> 00:13:07.700
<v Speaker 2>the doe by ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's probably not the best idea.</v>

282
00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:08.563
<v Speaker 2>They um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was an instance that happened a </v>

283
00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:13.700
<v Speaker 2>few years back where in 19 year old girl</v>
<v Speaker 2>was murdered,</v>

284
00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:15.380
<v Speaker 2>not murdered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>killed,</v>

285
00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:18.520
<v Speaker 2>partially eaten by coyotes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chi Health.</v>

286
00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:19.963
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the bits and chunks out of her </v>

287
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.100
<v Speaker 2>tore apart and she died in the hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty sure thought.</v>

288
00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:27.813
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there it was unusual circumstances </v>

289
00:13:30.831 --> 00:13:31.664
<v Speaker 2>and the one of the unusual circumstances</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the coyotes in this area are very </v>

290
00:13:34.551 --> 00:13:37.070
<v Speaker 2>limited in terms of what game is </v>
<v Speaker 2>available.</v>

291
00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:38.353
<v Speaker 2>So much so that they've been known to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>after Mousse that these little coyotes </v>

292
00:13:43.071 --> 00:13:46.100
<v Speaker 2>actually go after Moose and have </v>
<v Speaker 2>successfully taken moose out.</v>

293
00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:47.330
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

294
00:13:47.331 --> 00:13:49.270
<v Speaker 2>So these are gangster coyote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Next video,</v>

295
00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:50.880
<v Speaker 2>look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't look that big.</v>

296
00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:53.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah they're really big ones.</v>

297
00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:53.893
<v Speaker 2>Like 50 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

298
00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I watched a video the other day of a,</v>

299
00:13:56.461 --> 00:13:57.294
<v Speaker 2>a mother Moose trying to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop these wolves from eating her cow </v>

300
00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:04.130
<v Speaker 2>and her calf.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen that same style.</v>

301
00:14:04.131 --> 00:14:04.964
<v Speaker 2>Terrific.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

302
00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:08.930
<v Speaker 2>She's running around and stomping these </v>
<v Speaker 2>wolves and they're circling her and then</v>

303
00:14:08.931 --> 00:14:09.764
<v Speaker 2>they just grabbed the calf and drag it </v>
<v Speaker 2>away and she's fighting off the other </v>

304
00:14:12.291 --> 00:14:13.124
<v Speaker 2>wolves and stomping him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She stomped the shit out of a few of </v>

305
00:14:14.841 --> 00:14:15.550
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

306
00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:18.440
<v Speaker 2>She fucked a few of them up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] factual info.</v>

307
00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:21.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

308
00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:22.461
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw that one.</v>

309
00:14:22.461 --> 00:14:24.800
<v Speaker 2>That one's sucks cause there is Justin </v>
<v Speaker 2>Brown,</v>

310
00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:26.930
<v Speaker 2>that gentleman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very nice guy.</v>

311
00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:32.120
<v Speaker 2>We got to give us a lot of interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>insight as to like what happens in um,</v>

312
00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:33.950
<v Speaker 2>you know like with biologists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how they,</v>

313
00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:37.670
<v Speaker 2>how they track these animals and what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what some of the problems are.</v>

314
00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:38.631
<v Speaker 2>But we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were,</v>

315
00:14:38.631 --> 00:14:39.464
<v Speaker 2>were in such a unique place in southern </v>
<v Speaker 2>California because there's such a </v>

316
00:14:42.351 --> 00:14:45.980
<v Speaker 2>massive population of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's all these predators that are</v>

317
00:14:45.981 --> 00:14:48.320
<v Speaker 2>sort of like entangles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

318
00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:49.760
<v Speaker 2>And our system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

319
00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:52.160
<v Speaker 2>like hawks</v>

320
00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:53.570
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everywhere you look,</v>

321
00:14:53.571 --> 00:14:56.900
<v Speaker 1>there's hawks swooping down snatch and </v>
<v Speaker 1>doves and shit.</v>

322
00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:59.480
<v Speaker 1>And My,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my daughter got a little dog.</v>

323
00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:01.580
<v Speaker 1>I always felt a little dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her nasty rats,</v>

324
00:15:01.581 --> 00:15:03.650
<v Speaker 1>but I started liking these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm like,</v>

325
00:15:03.651 --> 00:15:04.160
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

326
00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:05.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm changing my mind about it.</v>

327
00:15:05.811 --> 00:15:06.644
<v Speaker 1>This is a cool dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's still like eight pounds or </v>

328
00:15:08.121 --> 00:15:09.050
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm like,</v>

329
00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:11.120
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't let him alone in the yard.</v>

330
00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:15.080
<v Speaker 1>Not because there's probably not coyotes</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the yard,</v>

331
00:15:15.081 --> 00:15:15.914
<v Speaker 1>but they're definitely hawks around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's definitely ours look like a big </v>

332
00:15:19.101 --> 00:15:19.934
<v Speaker 1>rabbit [inaudible] in three seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You cannot leave him in the yard like </v>

333
00:15:23.091 --> 00:15:26.030
<v Speaker 1>that because yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's how it is.</v>

334
00:15:26.031 --> 00:15:27.650
<v Speaker 1>That's when you have trade outdoors </v>
<v Speaker 1>around,</v>

335
00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:29.930
<v Speaker 1>you need to keep your eyes open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

336
00:15:29.931 --> 00:15:32.450
<v Speaker 1>there's no getting around it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no getting around it.</v>

337
00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:33.313
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when we look at how horrific the </v>

338
00:15:35.811 --> 00:15:36.644
<v Speaker 1>wild world is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a surprise that people who are </v>

339
00:15:39.111 --> 00:15:42.020
<v Speaker 1>just like recently civilized over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>last,</v>

340
00:15:42.021 --> 00:15:45.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like really realistically 10,000 years.</v>

341
00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:46.673
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's these really dark thing in </v>

342
00:15:49.281 --> 00:15:53.510
<v Speaker 1>people's minds where it's an opera on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the table.</v>

343
00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:56.180
<v Speaker 1>Most people are never going to pull the </v>
<v Speaker 1>trigger and go down there.</v>

344
00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:59.350
<v Speaker 1>But that's part of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are as a,</v>

345
00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:00.253
<v Speaker 1>as human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's why I enjoy doing </v>

346
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:06.020
<v Speaker 1>these [inaudible] me lie because he's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>story that's not trying to bash any side</v>

347
00:16:06.021 --> 00:16:06.854
<v Speaker 1>is not like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh look at those bad Americans doing </v>

348
00:16:08.271 --> 00:16:10.310
<v Speaker 1>these massacres.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's more,</v>

349
00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:11.413
<v Speaker 1>they were horrible people there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were also great people belonging </v>

350
00:16:13.581 --> 00:16:14.414
<v Speaker 1>to the same side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he to me is not about one particular </v>

351
00:16:18.801 --> 00:16:19.634
<v Speaker 1>group of people that one nation or they </v>
<v Speaker 1>want ethnic group or anything being the </v>

352
00:16:22.311 --> 00:16:24.200
<v Speaker 1>bad guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's on an individual level.</v>

353
00:16:24.201 --> 00:16:28.540
<v Speaker 1>What is the mix?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One guy go down this horror in desirable</v>

354
00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:30.920
<v Speaker 1>directions and other people instead </v>
<v Speaker 1>choosing,</v>

355
00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:32.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause that's what you've always done.</v>

356
00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:34.910
<v Speaker 1>You're always choosing not to be that </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

357
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.440
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what fascinates me.</v>

358
00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:38.770
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just um,</v>

359
00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:42.050
<v Speaker 1>there's a great book by Sebastian </v>
<v Speaker 1>younger called tribe.</v>

360
00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:43.490
<v Speaker 1>Have you read it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You read that one,</v>

361
00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:45.320
<v Speaker 1>wasn't it interesting when they talked </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

362
00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:46.163
<v Speaker 1>but when he talked about all of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that were kidnapped by native </v>

363
00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:51.010
<v Speaker 1>Americans that chose to live with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

364
00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:54.950
<v Speaker 1>And then when they were taken back by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Americans,</v>

365
00:16:54.951 --> 00:16:57.230
<v Speaker 1>by the settlers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

366
00:16:57.231 --> 00:16:58.041
<v Speaker 1>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck this,</v>

367
00:16:58.041 --> 00:17:00.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm going back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going back to the native Americans.</v>

368
00:17:00.081 --> 00:17:02.960
<v Speaker 1>And they went and lived with them again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no one went the other way.</v>

369
00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:05.360
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is really crazy.</v>

370
00:17:05.361 --> 00:17:06.194
<v Speaker 1>Something not flat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're in about the euro American </v>

371
00:17:08.151 --> 00:17:09.180
<v Speaker 1>culture of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

372
00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:11.600
<v Speaker 1>There's a great Benjamin Franklin call </v>
<v Speaker 1>of time.</v>

373
00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:14.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to butcher it cause I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>even remember the beginning.</v>

374
00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:18.430
<v Speaker 1>Something about no European West tasted </v>
<v Speaker 1>savage life and then basically go on.</v>

375
00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:22.220
<v Speaker 1>Can be or to come back to living our </v>
<v Speaker 1>settlements or something like that.</v>

376
00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:23.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

377
00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:25.930
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's see something about fun.</v>

378
00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:28.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way they're living their camping,</v>

379
00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:29.693
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a hunting and fishing every day </v>

380
00:17:30.951 --> 00:17:31.784
<v Speaker 1>and you go back and these assholes were </v>
<v Speaker 1>wearing powdered wigs and banging a </v>

381
00:17:34.131 --> 00:17:36.560
<v Speaker 1>wooden mallet on a table for everybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>to pay attention.</v>

382
00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:39.310
<v Speaker 1>Fuck off SPEC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

383
00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:44.060
<v Speaker 1>But that's where you hear you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I beat about called charts,</v>

384
00:17:44.061 --> 00:17:44.894
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People spend time with that romanticize </v>

385
00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:48.250
<v Speaker 1>native college courses like Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're old,</v>

386
00:17:48.251 --> 00:17:49.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hug trees.</v>

387
00:17:49.291 --> 00:17:53.130
<v Speaker 1>And in talking with the four recruiters </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the forest and I'm like,</v>

388
00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.820
<v Speaker 1>well yes and no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are like what you mentioned,</v>

389
00:17:56.821 --> 00:17:58.690
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you are capture,</v>

390
00:17:58.691 --> 00:18:02.140
<v Speaker 1>especially in the east when like French </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Indian war or stuff like that,</v>

391
00:18:02.141 --> 00:18:04.350
<v Speaker 1>I work going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you are a capture by,</v>

392
00:18:04.351 --> 00:18:07.020
<v Speaker 1>it would in an that raid one of two </v>
<v Speaker 1>things happen.</v>

393
00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:08.153
<v Speaker 1>The good one is that they like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they decide to adopt you and then </v>

394
00:18:11.221 --> 00:18:14.050
<v Speaker 1>you end up replacing one of their dead </v>
<v Speaker 1>family members.</v>

395
00:18:14.051 --> 00:18:16.260
<v Speaker 1>So like if they lost a brother or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>father,</v>

396
00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:20.910
<v Speaker 1>then you become that person for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>purpose thing that they did.</v>

397
00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:22.230
<v Speaker 1>It's very weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

398
00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:26.880
<v Speaker 1>but the thing is the adoption process </v>
<v Speaker 1>was so thorough that they love you,</v>

399
00:18:26.881 --> 00:18:27.714
<v Speaker 1>like you're the real deal and you end up</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling like you're part of this family </v>

400
00:18:31.201 --> 00:18:32.034
<v Speaker 1>and you know everything works out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's everything is great if they don't </v>

401
00:18:35.071 --> 00:18:38.850
<v Speaker 1>like you that they torture you to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>of our three day period.</v>

402
00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:41.290
<v Speaker 1>So it's like these are the same people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

403
00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:42.613
<v Speaker 1>They can be the sweetest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most also be women's or really messed </v>

404
00:18:45.781 --> 00:18:47.370
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same Culture,</v>

405
00:18:47.371 --> 00:18:48.204
<v Speaker 1>same individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that's just because people </v>

406
00:18:51.001 --> 00:18:51.834
<v Speaker 1>have evolved be dealing with tribal </v>
<v Speaker 1>warfare and just we have to have that </v>

407
00:18:55.831 --> 00:18:56.664
<v Speaker 1>switch?</v>

408
00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:57.593
<v Speaker 1>I think he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the thing that's interesting </v>

409
00:18:59.161 --> 00:19:01.560
<v Speaker 1>about natives is that it wasn't a racial</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

410
00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:03.010
<v Speaker 1>They adopted anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

411
00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:03.863
<v Speaker 1>Didn't matter what skin color you will </v>
<v Speaker 1>have that they did not have a barrier </v>

412
00:19:06.541 --> 00:19:09.540
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there is a big insider outsider,</v>

413
00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:12.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you are part of our tribe and you may</v>

414
00:19:12.091 --> 00:19:14.670
<v Speaker 1>become part of our tribe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>race doesn't matter.</v>

415
00:19:14.671 --> 00:19:17.510
<v Speaker 1>You can become part of our tribe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but once you're part of our tribe,</v>

416
00:19:17.511 --> 00:19:20.570
<v Speaker 1>er one of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're not part of our tribe,</v>

417
00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:24.570
<v Speaker 1>then you know the same rules do not </v>
<v Speaker 1>apply to you.</v>

418
00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:27.360
<v Speaker 1>You are whether you are an enemy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are.</v>

419
00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:30.370
<v Speaker 1>And in that case that's when it gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>ready a bit older.</v>

420
00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:32.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even with other native Americans,</v>

421
00:19:32.821 --> 00:19:33.654
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing that people need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>really get an like we especially people </v>

422
00:19:36.481 --> 00:19:37.314
<v Speaker 1>that only have a peripheral </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding of native American </v>

423
00:19:39.061 --> 00:19:39.894
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the reason why sewer called sous </v>

424
00:19:42.481 --> 00:19:44.430
<v Speaker 1>cause that's a native American word for </v>
<v Speaker 1>enemy.</v>

425
00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:46.800
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They call themselves Lakota people.</v>

426
00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:48.053
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all the other Indians were like fuck </v>

427
00:19:49.501 --> 00:19:53.460
<v Speaker 1>these crazy ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes you to over there the enemy.</v>

428
00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:54.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally.</v>

429
00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:56.180
<v Speaker 1>They were just dominating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

430
00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:57.233
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really fascinating when you </v>

431
00:19:58.260 --> 00:19:59.093
<v Speaker 1>consider that these people had these </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting grounds and they were trying to </v>

432
00:20:02.011 --> 00:20:07.011
<v Speaker 1>protect and one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've found is that there are areas or</v>

433
00:20:07.051 --> 00:20:07.884
<v Speaker 1>wildlife thrived and the wildlife </v>
<v Speaker 1>thrived in these like a gray area </v>

434
00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:16.770
<v Speaker 1>because like this one area would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

435
00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:20.280
<v Speaker 1>one native American tribe and then there</v>
<v Speaker 1>are a hunting grounds.</v>

436
00:20:20.281 --> 00:20:22.890
<v Speaker 1>Went to a specific specified distance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

437
00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:24.720
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously always in conflict,</v>

438
00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:27.450
<v Speaker 1>but then pass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was another native American tribes.</v>

439
00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:28.493
<v Speaker 1>But in the middle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where you'd find all the fucking </v>

440
00:20:29.521 --> 00:20:31.140
<v Speaker 1>animals of course is they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

441
00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:32.453
<v Speaker 1>Nobody haunts me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or they are worried about killing each </v>

442
00:20:34.951 --> 00:20:36.210
<v Speaker 1>other in New Hampshire zone.</v>

443
00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:38.790
<v Speaker 1>So now I thought that's how it is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they figured that out.</v>

444
00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:39.673
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

445
00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:41.280
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you been to yellowstone?</v>

446
00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:42.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's beautiful.</v>

447
00:20:42.511 --> 00:20:43.530
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

448
00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:46.770
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that's really crazy is</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go around the tourist center,</v>

449
00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:49.600
<v Speaker 1>there's elk everywhere just lounging </v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

450
00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:53.920
<v Speaker 1>They tell you don't get more than 20 </v>
<v Speaker 1>yards closer to a,</v>

451
00:20:53.921 --> 00:20:54.754
<v Speaker 1>an a an alc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause they will charge you occasionally </v>

452
00:20:56.351 --> 00:20:58.870
<v Speaker 1>and they like tired of people taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking self.</v>

453
00:20:59.390 --> 00:21:02.800
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

454
00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:04.110
<v Speaker 1>I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was out there.</v>

455
00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:06.220
<v Speaker 1>I and I've seen elk in the wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wild.</v>

456
00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:07.073
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they've figured out that wolves </v>

457
00:21:08.471 --> 00:21:09.304
<v Speaker 1>don't come to the tourist center.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like I got an idea and then they </v>

458
00:21:12.281 --> 00:21:15.040
<v Speaker 1>realize these people are different than </v>
<v Speaker 1>the people that hunt us.</v>

459
00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:16.323
<v Speaker 1>Somehow or another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they put it together like like one day </v>

460
00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:21.940
<v Speaker 1>it'll all could go wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

461
00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:25.580
<v Speaker 1>Civilization could collapse and you just</v>
<v Speaker 1>go right to yellowstone,</v>

462
00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:26.443
<v Speaker 1>go to that fucking tourist centers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's meet everywhere mold on the APP </v>

463
00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:33.160
<v Speaker 1>because you need hundreds of them on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>lawn at the tourist center.</v>

464
00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:37.420
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make any sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know what it is like what is</v>

465
00:21:37.421 --> 00:21:38.254
<v Speaker 1>the intellectual process that allows a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an elk to understand that these people </v>

466
00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:43.713
<v Speaker 1>are not going to try to eat me and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the wolves are not going to be around </v>

467
00:21:47.561 --> 00:21:48.394
<v Speaker 1>these people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It barely took some really stupid </v>

468
00:21:50.411 --> 00:21:51.244
<v Speaker 1>dialogue to stick around people before </v>
<v Speaker 1>they realize those are to go to us so </v>

469
00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:56.230
<v Speaker 1>that everybody was looking back at like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hawaii.</v>

470
00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:59.050
<v Speaker 1>They didn't get killed over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They feed feeding and peanuts.</v>

471
00:21:59.051 --> 00:22:01.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But even though we can try to,</v>

472
00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:03.310
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wonder what it was,</v>

473
00:22:03.311 --> 00:22:04.144
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if we really know like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanism that allows them all as a </v>

474
00:22:08.921 --> 00:22:09.790
<v Speaker 1>group to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

475
00:22:09.791 --> 00:22:11.260
<v Speaker 1>you can just chill out around these </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

476
00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:14.590
<v Speaker 1>Just lie down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Please lie down if you know us.</v>

477
00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:16.400
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is fun.</v>

478
00:22:16.401 --> 00:22:19.590
<v Speaker 1>It all the national parks you see the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most study mode thereby.</v>

479
00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:21.970
<v Speaker 1>It's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's always,</v>

480
00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:23.920
<v Speaker 1>it's a fascinating that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

481
00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:25.053
<v Speaker 1>there's never been like a non warring </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful group of humans because it </v>

482
00:22:31.211 --> 00:22:32.021
<v Speaker 1>only takes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

483
00:22:32.021 --> 00:22:35.940
<v Speaker 1>you can really be a pacifist around </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody who isn't because,</v>

484
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:36.571
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

485
00:22:36.571 --> 00:22:38.860
<v Speaker 1>you decide to go in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's mellow,</v>

486
00:22:38.861 --> 00:22:39.694
<v Speaker 1>peaceful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>happy society and you get your ass </v>

487
00:22:41.231 --> 00:22:42.064
<v Speaker 1>kicked by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a great story about the origins </v>

488
00:22:44.141 --> 00:22:47.000
<v Speaker 1>of not even before the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like buddy teacher called onesie.</v>

489
00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:48.670
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll be coming to the United States.</v>

490
00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:51.970
<v Speaker 1>Everybody hears about the Plymouth Rock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

491
00:22:51.971 --> 00:22:53.980
<v Speaker 1>There's the whole of the puritans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They show up,</v>

492
00:22:53.981 --> 00:22:56.770
<v Speaker 1>all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What usually people don't hear.</v>

493
00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:58.450
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was wrestled,</v>

494
00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.310
<v Speaker 1>played a little with this store in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>

495
00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:01.603
<v Speaker 1>There was these other settlement called </v>
<v Speaker 1>marymount that was just down the street </v>

496
00:23:04.541 --> 00:23:06.640
<v Speaker 1>from Plymouth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they were completely different.</v>

497
00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:09.490
<v Speaker 1>Their interpretation of Christianity was</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much a,</v>

498
00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:13.720
<v Speaker 1>but he Christiano agonies mix with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of Christian ideas.</v>

499
00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:16.930
<v Speaker 1>They had the exact opposite approach of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the puritans.</v>

500
00:23:16.931 --> 00:23:21.190
<v Speaker 1>They were having drank and orgies with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the native tribes.</v>

501
00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:22.340
<v Speaker 1>They were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

502
00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:23.193
<v Speaker 1>they were the equivalent of like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>heat piece of the 16 hundreds just </v>

503
00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:27.233
<v Speaker 1>aching back having fun and deputies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started getting edgy because when new </v>

504
00:23:31.631 --> 00:23:34.870
<v Speaker 1>people would show up on the coast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would take a look at the puritans.</v>

505
00:23:34.871 --> 00:23:36.970
<v Speaker 1>They would take a look at Mary Mount and</v>
<v Speaker 1>be like,</v>

506
00:23:36.971 --> 00:23:38.320
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to marry mouth.</v>

507
00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:40.970
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These guys are whipping themselves.</v>

508
00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:44.740
<v Speaker 1>Life socks over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so of course that was bad.</v>

509
00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:46.190
<v Speaker 1>Even</v>

510
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:47.023
<v Speaker 3>some puritans were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see Johannine I'm gone for a couple of </v>

511
00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:52.090
<v Speaker 3>weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the,</v>

512
00:23:52.091 --> 00:23:54.830
<v Speaker 3>the hardcore guys decided,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well we can't have that.</v>

513
00:23:54.831 --> 00:23:55.664
<v Speaker 3>So they got their guns showed up and </v>
<v Speaker 3>close down Mary Mountain and that's the </v>

514
00:23:59.331 --> 00:24:00.740
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Ed,</v>

515
00:24:00.741 --> 00:24:01.574
<v Speaker 3>the Marymount guys not be so them plays </v>
<v Speaker 3>a heat piece and actually got their act </v>

516
00:24:04.671 --> 00:24:06.650
<v Speaker 3>together and trained with guns and </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

517
00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:09.290
<v Speaker 3>They would have been able to keep their </v>
<v Speaker 3>community going.</v>

518
00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:13.850
<v Speaker 3>We those values all you just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need that minimum of self defense.</v>

519
00:24:13.851 --> 00:24:16.520
<v Speaker 3>So there was somebody else squash,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is exactly what happened.</v>

520
00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:18.670
<v Speaker 3>Was that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the,</v>

521
00:24:18.671 --> 00:24:21.410
<v Speaker 3>the name Loyola Marymount,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does it come from those people?</v>

522
00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:23.270
<v Speaker 3>I dumped it because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

523
00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:24.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea.</v>

524
00:24:24.771 --> 00:24:25.610
<v Speaker 3>So I'm going to lie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

525
00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:28.620
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause you know,</v>

526
00:24:28.621 --> 00:24:29.454
<v Speaker 3>like y'all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like does it strike me exactly as a </v>

527
00:24:30.321 --> 00:24:32.470
<v Speaker 3>drunken largest with no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not at all.</v>

528
00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:33.460
<v Speaker 3>That's why I was confused.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

529
00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:34.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd never heard of that before,</v>

530
00:24:34.671 --> 00:24:37.160
<v Speaker 3>but it makes sense that there'd be </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone that would deviate.</v>

531
00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:38.293
<v Speaker 3>There's always someone who just looks at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way everyone else is doing it and </v>

532
00:24:39.831 --> 00:24:41.870
<v Speaker 3>just says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is fucking not for me,</v>

533
00:24:41.871 --> 00:24:42.704
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Talk to him.</v>

534
00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:44.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it always goes bad.</v>

535
00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:47.360
<v Speaker 3>Like there's never been a cult where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

536
00:24:47.361 --> 00:24:48.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they got together,</v>

537
00:24:48.321 --> 00:24:50.720
<v Speaker 3>formed a commune and just really were </v>
<v Speaker 3>cool to each other.</v>

538
00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:54.200
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm actually fascinated with exactly the</v>

539
00:24:54.201 --> 00:24:55.520
<v Speaker 3>thing you said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why,</v>

540
00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:58.790
<v Speaker 3>why can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's so damn hard about power?</v>

541
00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:00.330
<v Speaker 3>It's the ones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what it is.</v>

542
00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:03.770
<v Speaker 3>One person in power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the one person in a position of power is</v>

543
00:25:03.771 --> 00:25:08.771
<v Speaker 3>almost always um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>abusive and they almost always used that</v>

544
00:25:09.651 --> 00:25:12.860
<v Speaker 3>power to their own ego,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ego gratification and dominance.</v>

545
00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:15.170
<v Speaker 3>They always fuck all the other guy's </v>
<v Speaker 3>wives.</v>

546
00:25:15.171 --> 00:25:16.004
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the old,</v>

547
00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:17.900
<v Speaker 3>they all father a bunch of children.</v>

548
00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:19.880
<v Speaker 3>They take everyone's money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

549
00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:21.053
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm fascinated by that kind of stuff </v>

550
00:25:23.691 --> 00:25:27.200
<v Speaker 3>because one of the things that you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see when you,</v>

551
00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:28.063
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you become famous or if you do </v>

552
00:25:30.141 --> 00:25:32.450
<v Speaker 3>something that gets you a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>notoriety is,</v>

553
00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:36.020
<v Speaker 3>I know how I feel around certain famous </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

554
00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:36.820
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

555
00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:37.653
<v Speaker 3>I really like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've talked about like first time I met </v>

556
00:25:38.811 --> 00:25:41.030
<v Speaker 3>Anthony Bordain who I respect a great </v>
<v Speaker 3>deal.</v>

557
00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:43.760
<v Speaker 3>I was like a little school kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

558
00:25:43.761 --> 00:25:45.290
<v Speaker 3>I was just such a Dork.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

559
00:25:45.291 --> 00:25:46.610
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fucking love your show.</v>

560
00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:49.080
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that slabs.</v>

561
00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:51.050
<v Speaker 3>It was jenny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I love his writing too.</v>

562
00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:52.063
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was genuinely excited to see him </v>

563
00:25:53.421 --> 00:25:54.430
<v Speaker 3>and meet him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

564
00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:56.900
<v Speaker 3>it's still to this day when I talked to </v>
<v Speaker 3>him a little dorked out.</v>

565
00:25:57.170 --> 00:26:00.530
<v Speaker 3>So when you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you take a person who's not,</v>

566
00:26:00.531 --> 00:26:02.210
<v Speaker 3>and I'm used to being around </v>
<v Speaker 3>celebrities,</v>

567
00:26:02.211 --> 00:26:06.920
<v Speaker 3>I've been around a lot of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you take someone who's not used</v>

568
00:26:06.921 --> 00:26:07.754
<v Speaker 3>to being around someone who is in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>position of adoration and they don't </v>

569
00:26:11.901 --> 00:26:15.710
<v Speaker 3>know how to handle it and they just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just give in to whatever,</v>

570
00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:18.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Beta tendencies that have,</v>

571
00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:20.300
<v Speaker 3>and this Alpha just takes over.</v>

572
00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:25.220
<v Speaker 3>There's a natural thing that human </v>
<v Speaker 3>beings do in these small isolated groups</v>

573
00:26:25.221 --> 00:26:28.170
<v Speaker 3>that don't get checked and it almost </v>
<v Speaker 3>always is the,</v>

574
00:26:28.171 --> 00:26:31.820
<v Speaker 3>the man who is in charge of it winds up </v>
<v Speaker 3>abusing everybody.</v>

575
00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:32.673
<v Speaker 3>Yup,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup,</v>

576
00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:33.680
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which again,</v>

577
00:26:33.681 --> 00:26:36.490
<v Speaker 3>it goes back to that pirate of human </v>
<v Speaker 3>nature is what,</v>

578
00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:39.080
<v Speaker 3>why do you have to go down that path?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can have a great life,</v>

579
00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:42.290
<v Speaker 3>you can enjoy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>be nice to people making,</v>

580
00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:44.170
<v Speaker 3>you are in a position leadership.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You use</v>

581
00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:45.003
<v Speaker 1>that to make sure the whole thing runs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mostly everybody's taking care of us </v>

582
00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:51.910
<v Speaker 1>that were pisses me off because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

583
00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:54.620
<v Speaker 1>that occurred to me is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

584
00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:57.120
<v Speaker 1>I understand it and I don't understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>it because I mean,</v>

585
00:26:57.121 --> 00:26:57.954
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it enough times that I know </v>

586
00:26:59.170 --> 00:27:02.010
<v Speaker 1>you are exactly 100% right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time,</v>

587
00:27:02.011 --> 00:27:05.160
<v Speaker 1>I really don't get it because you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>still have a great life.</v>

588
00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:07.710
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's denying you all the good things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you want.</v>

589
00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:11.640
<v Speaker 1>Just be a semi decent human.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that hard.</v>

590
00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:13.560
<v Speaker 1>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would think it's not that hard,</v>

591
00:27:13.561 --> 00:27:15.690
<v Speaker 1>but when there's no one checking you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

592
00:27:15.691 --> 00:27:16.524
<v Speaker 1>you're in the Oregon Woods and you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>got this fucking yogurt and everybody </v>

593
00:27:19.201 --> 00:27:23.680
<v Speaker 1>lives together and you just bang </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody give you all,</v>

594
00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:27.570
<v Speaker 1>you're all their gold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's people for whatever reason,</v>

595
00:27:27.571 --> 00:27:31.500
<v Speaker 1>when there's a person that is the king </v>
<v Speaker 1>or a person that is like some,</v>

596
00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:33.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cult leader or whatever your Messiah,</v>

597
00:27:33.781 --> 00:27:37.380
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want to call them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people just want that person to have the</v>

598
00:27:37.381 --> 00:27:37.830
<v Speaker 1>answers.</v>

599
00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:39.360
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they gravitate towards that.</v>

600
00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:40.823
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sizely one of the thing that bugs me </v>

601
00:27:43.471 --> 00:27:44.640
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

602
00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:48.180
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people who are willing to put </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves in that position of like,</v>

603
00:27:48.181 --> 00:27:52.080
<v Speaker 1>I am your big leader.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me there's a way to be a leader.</v>

604
00:27:52.081 --> 00:27:53.550
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>

605
00:27:53.551 --> 00:27:54.384
<v Speaker 1>Sort of the Taoist approach where people</v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't even feel that you are a </v>

606
00:27:56.701 --> 00:27:57.534
<v Speaker 1>leader by yard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like sub to the moving sings along to </v>

607
00:27:59.701 --> 00:28:02.400
<v Speaker 1>make sure everybody's taken care of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a leader.</v>

608
00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:04.890
<v Speaker 1>But that's not because it's not all </v>
<v Speaker 1>bills.</v>

609
00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:06.143
<v Speaker 1>Most people need the exactly what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>say dates they need their father figure </v>

610
00:28:09.481 --> 00:28:14.010
<v Speaker 1>to laid out below to be very dogmatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so tiny in there.</v>

611
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:15.690
<v Speaker 1>I know he told,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't worry,</v>

612
00:28:15.691 --> 00:28:17.550
<v Speaker 1>I have hold the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's is good,</v>

613
00:28:17.551 --> 00:28:19.740
<v Speaker 1>this is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people love that.</v>

614
00:28:19.741 --> 00:28:20.574
<v Speaker 1>They love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In dictators they love dating or </v>

615
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:23.850
<v Speaker 1>religious cult leaders.</v>

616
00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:24.713
<v Speaker 1>They love 18 inequity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seen that type of personality gathers a </v>

617
00:28:29.281 --> 00:28:30.114
<v Speaker 1>whole lot of full lawyers who need the </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody to look confident and sure of </v>

618
00:28:33.901 --> 00:28:34.734
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter whether they are or </v>

619
00:28:35.551 --> 00:28:37.260
<v Speaker 1>they aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they put on a good show,</v>

620
00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:39.090
<v Speaker 1>people with bite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

621
00:28:39.091 --> 00:28:39.924
<v Speaker 1>It seems like a pattern that just sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of gets established and human beings </v>

622
00:28:43.021 --> 00:28:45.960
<v Speaker 1>from being a child and having your </v>
<v Speaker 1>parents don't touch that.</v>

623
00:28:45.961 --> 00:28:47.010
<v Speaker 1>That's hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come with me.</v>

624
00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:48.870
<v Speaker 1>This is the way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what you have to do.</v>

625
00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:51.270
<v Speaker 1>This is how you put your shoes on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it tie your shoe?</v>

626
00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:52.273
<v Speaker 1>How you get to work this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do this to say do that and then you </v>

627
00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:55.493
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden you don't have anybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>telling you what to do anymore and then </v>

628
00:28:57.870 --> 00:28:59.800
<v Speaker 1>all along comes the cult leader.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep,</v>

629
00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:01.350
<v Speaker 1>I've got the answers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guess what?</v>

630
00:29:01.351 --> 00:29:02.130
<v Speaker 1>They're coming straight from.</v>

631
00:29:02.130 --> 00:29:05.470
<v Speaker 1>God's a fuck your parents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My parents didn't know shit but that,</v>

632
00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:08.490
<v Speaker 1>but that's what's funny is that the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who grow it up would be like your</v>

633
00:29:08.491 --> 00:29:10.530
<v Speaker 1>parents tell you a tie your shoes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

634
00:29:10.531 --> 00:29:11.550
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

635
00:29:11.551 --> 00:29:12.384
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly somebody come along with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>are 20 or 30 tie your shoe and you're </v>

636
00:29:15.151 --> 00:29:15.631
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

637
00:29:15.631 --> 00:29:18.660
<v Speaker 1>you are so wise and have me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lisa is the way at the time,</v>

638
00:29:18.661 --> 00:29:19.141
<v Speaker 1>my shoe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

639
00:29:19.141 --> 00:29:20.400
<v Speaker 1>great master.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

640
00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:23.040
<v Speaker 1>There's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man.</v>

641
00:29:23.041 --> 00:29:25.800
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was interesting.</v>

642
00:29:25.801 --> 00:29:28.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you have been following </v>
<v Speaker 1>like where I'm Dan Carlin,</v>

643
00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:31.050
<v Speaker 1>the stuff that he has been saying about </v>
<v Speaker 1>his other show.</v>

644
00:29:31.051 --> 00:29:33.060
<v Speaker 1>Common Sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't listened to it lately.</v>

645
00:29:33.090 --> 00:29:34.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he hasn't been releasing ips on lately.</v>

646
00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:38.830
<v Speaker 1>That's probably why you haven't because </v>
<v Speaker 1>he has kind of shut down with that.</v>

647
00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:43.750
<v Speaker 1>It's not officially done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in thing is my approach,</v>

648
00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:46.840
<v Speaker 1>meaning Dan talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my approach is to be calm.</v>

649
00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:47.673
<v Speaker 1>What somewhat sub though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somewhat like play and not be overly </v>

650
00:29:50.711 --> 00:29:55.240
<v Speaker 1>dogmatic one way or another to think on </v>
<v Speaker 1>my feet to mix mixings together and that</v>

651
00:29:55.241 --> 00:29:58.570
<v Speaker 1>some scene that most people don't want </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the current climate,</v>

652
00:29:58.571 --> 00:30:01.810
<v Speaker 1>most people want the very black and </v>
<v Speaker 1>white type of approach.</v>

653
00:30:02.170 --> 00:30:05.590
<v Speaker 1>Now I disagree with Dan because I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that steel,</v>

654
00:30:05.591 --> 00:30:06.424
<v Speaker 1>there is an enormous need for what he </v>
<v Speaker 1>provides and I don't think that just </v>

655
00:30:10.511 --> 00:30:11.344
<v Speaker 1>giving up is the solution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do get it because it really </v>

656
00:30:13.661 --> 00:30:14.680
<v Speaker 1>doesn't take much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

657
00:30:14.681 --> 00:30:15.514
<v Speaker 1>if you start screaming a very dogmatic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either super leftist or super </v>

658
00:30:19.151 --> 00:30:19.984
<v Speaker 1>conservative approach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get out to magically a bunch of </v>

659
00:30:22.331 --> 00:30:23.164
<v Speaker 1>folders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you are thinking on your feet and </v>

660
00:30:25.841 --> 00:30:26.970
<v Speaker 1>just going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>

661
00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:28.060
<v Speaker 1>this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

662
00:30:28.061 --> 00:30:28.894
<v Speaker 1>you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's look at the other side and </v>

663
00:30:30.821 --> 00:30:32.050
<v Speaker 1>constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

664
00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:34.570
<v Speaker 1>you know what any decent human being </v>
<v Speaker 1>should do.</v>

665
00:30:34.571 --> 00:30:37.130
<v Speaker 1>Just be an intellectually honest and </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking sinks.</v>

666
00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:42.010
<v Speaker 1>People don't respond to that because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that easy or rather people do.</v>

667
00:30:42.011 --> 00:30:42.844
<v Speaker 1>Some people respond,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's a number wise is a way a </v>

668
00:30:45.431 --> 00:30:49.660
<v Speaker 1>minority compared to what you get by </v>
<v Speaker 1>being a black and white kind of guy.</v>

669
00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:54.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People desire very clear resolutions and</v>

670
00:30:54.291 --> 00:30:57.590
<v Speaker 3>very clear thinking in terms of like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>enemy.</v>

671
00:30:57.591 --> 00:30:58.424
<v Speaker 3>Friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

672
00:30:58.490 --> 00:31:00.290
<v Speaker 3>this is a black and white issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

673
00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:01.573
<v Speaker 3>but I think Dan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that also just felt overwhelmed by the </v>

674
00:31:04.161 --> 00:31:04.994
<v Speaker 3>times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like this just seems like </v>

675
00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:08.910
<v Speaker 3>everything's so fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd rather not even talk about it.</v>

676
00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:12.260
<v Speaker 3>Just sit back and see what is really </v>
<v Speaker 3>happening.</v>

677
00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:13.400
<v Speaker 3>We were on the phone,</v>

678
00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:17.070
<v Speaker 1>I swear I spend like an hour on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>phone way you or whoever back and forth.</v>

679
00:31:17.071 --> 00:31:17.904
<v Speaker 1>I was playing in bye bye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was played a remembered a second </v>

680
00:31:20.011 --> 00:31:23.490
<v Speaker 1>movie of Lord of the Rings where there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>for all the old [inaudible]</v>

681
00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:25.880
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't do this anymore.</v>

682
00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:27.470
<v Speaker 3>And they're sab going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

683
00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:28.770
<v Speaker 3>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need to,</v>

684
00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:31.170
<v Speaker 3>I think I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to step up my game.</v>

685
00:31:31.171 --> 00:31:32.004
<v Speaker 3>I'm a Shitty Sam because I was trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do that for that and it just kind of </v>

686
00:31:34.411 --> 00:31:36.510
<v Speaker 3>motivate him and I miss it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really failed.</v>

687
00:31:36.511 --> 00:31:37.344
<v Speaker 3>So I respect where he's coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said that when he was on the show </v>

688
00:31:40.170 --> 00:31:41.200
<v Speaker 3>recently,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

689
00:31:41.250 --> 00:31:42.083
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was talking about that sort of same </v>

690
00:31:43.231 --> 00:31:44.064
<v Speaker 3>thing that he's kind of put that podcast</v>
<v Speaker 3>on hold long as he keeps doing his </v>

691
00:31:46.981 --> 00:31:47.814
<v Speaker 3>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hardcore history is just so important I </v>

692
00:31:50.671 --> 00:31:53.910
<v Speaker 3>think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think him and you are providing,</v>

693
00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:54.773
<v Speaker 3>you guys are providing uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an entertaining and interesting history </v>

694
00:31:58.351 --> 00:32:01.230
<v Speaker 3>lesson that really wasn't available </v>
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

695
00:32:01.231 --> 00:32:02.064
<v Speaker 3>I mean before he could get a book on </v>
<v Speaker 3>tape and if is really well written book </v>

696
00:32:04.651 --> 00:32:07.290
<v Speaker 3>and it was read by someone with like </v>
<v Speaker 3>good dramatic flare.</v>

697
00:32:07.290 --> 00:32:10.560
<v Speaker 3>It was exciting stuff but nobody really </v>
<v Speaker 3>got into it.</v>

698
00:32:10.561 --> 00:32:11.850
<v Speaker 3>I bet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet the numbers,</v>

699
00:32:12.150 --> 00:32:12.983
<v Speaker 3>if you consider the numbers of people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that have listened to his podcast and </v>

700
00:32:15.001 --> 00:32:19.500
<v Speaker 3>your podcast in comparison to like </v>
<v Speaker 3>before you guys were around,</v>

701
00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:20.723
<v Speaker 3>there's probably a radically improved </v>
<v Speaker 3>number of people that know a lot about </v>

702
00:32:24.601 --> 00:32:25.434
<v Speaker 3>history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

703
00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:26.303
<v Speaker 3>For particular things like the Mongols.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never even thought about the Mongols </v>

704
00:32:29.671 --> 00:32:30.504
<v Speaker 3>until I listened to his podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which apparently right now if you're in </v>

705
00:32:33.451 --> 00:32:38.340
<v Speaker 3>the La area in Simi Valley,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the Ronald Reagan Museum,</v>

706
00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:40.970
<v Speaker 3>the Reagan Museum or a library,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is it?</v>

707
00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:44.450
<v Speaker 3>There's a giant Genghis Khan exhibit </v>
<v Speaker 3>Railey.</v>

708
00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:45.403
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have the bows and all the stuff </v>

709
00:32:47.931 --> 00:32:51.830
<v Speaker 3>they stole and the textiles and all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>dif different things.</v>

710
00:32:51.831 --> 00:32:55.220
<v Speaker 3>They warn their yurts that they slept in</v>
<v Speaker 3>all kinds of crazy shit.</v>

711
00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:56.310
<v Speaker 3>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Want to go?</v>

712
00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:57.313
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that stuff's over a thousand </v>

713
00:32:59.060 --> 00:32:59.211
<v Speaker 3>years old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

714
00:32:59.211 --> 00:33:00.044
<v Speaker 3>Or close to it.</v>

715
00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:01.580
<v Speaker 3>There was 1200 scouts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

716
00:33:01.581 --> 00:33:02.250
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

717
00:33:02.250 --> 00:33:04.220
<v Speaker 3>So close to a thousand years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

718
00:33:04.221 --> 00:33:06.230
<v Speaker 3>but oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there it is right there.</v>

719
00:33:06.231 --> 00:33:08.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Check it out.</v>

720
00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:11.690
<v Speaker 3>They had bows that required 160 pounds </v>
<v Speaker 3>to pull back.</v>

721
00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:13.630
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the hell were these guys?</v>

722
00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:16.280
<v Speaker 3>So we'll pull this 60 pound boy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's insane.</v>

723
00:33:16.281 --> 00:33:19.160
<v Speaker 3>And they must have been animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There must've been so fucking strong.</v>

724
00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:20.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll put 60 pounds and you're like,</v>

725
00:33:20.841 --> 00:33:22.430
<v Speaker 3>holy hell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is heavy.</v>

726
00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:24.620
<v Speaker 3>Hundred and 60 is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

727
00:33:24.621 --> 00:33:25.610
<v Speaker 3>I have a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

728
00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:29.630
<v Speaker 3>up compound bow and the compound bow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a regular,</v>

729
00:33:29.631 --> 00:33:30.980
<v Speaker 3>like a recurve,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like these guys should.</v>

730
00:33:30.981 --> 00:33:34.130
<v Speaker 3>I believe they invented the recurve too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't invent it.</v>

731
00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:37.430
<v Speaker 3>They were around in the era when the </v>
<v Speaker 3>recurve was invented,</v>

732
00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:40.220
<v Speaker 3>which just by the design of the bow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it pulls,</v>

733
00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:43.280
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gives you more power,</v>

734
00:33:43.281 --> 00:33:45.200
<v Speaker 3>more energy gets released through the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Arrow.</v>

735
00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:48.230
<v Speaker 3>But w with a compound bow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a big led off.</v>

736
00:33:48.290 --> 00:33:51.380
<v Speaker 3>So it's only difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you had a 60 pound bow,</v>

737
00:33:51.381 --> 00:33:52.214
<v Speaker 3>it's only deaf,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's only 60 pounds for like the first </v>

738
00:33:54.111 --> 00:33:57.920
<v Speaker 3>six inches of shell pulling it back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then as you completely pull back,</v>

739
00:33:57.921 --> 00:34:01.130
<v Speaker 3>there's like an 85% led off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's much easier to hold.</v>

740
00:34:01.131 --> 00:34:01.964
<v Speaker 3>Right though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were pulling 160 the whole title </v>

741
00:34:04.930 --> 00:34:06.470
<v Speaker 3>the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was harder.</v>

742
00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:07.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>

743
00:34:07.341 --> 00:34:08.174
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they could aim a perfectly on </v>

744
00:34:09.651 --> 00:34:12.580
<v Speaker 3>horseback while the rally they knew full</v>
<v Speaker 3>gallop is like who,</v>

745
00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:16.670
<v Speaker 3>I mean they apparently used to time the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Arrow release while the horse was in the</v>

746
00:34:16.671 --> 00:34:17.271
<v Speaker 3>air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

747
00:34:17.271 --> 00:34:19.880
<v Speaker 3>Cause then you don't have the unevenness</v>
<v Speaker 3>of faith.</v>

748
00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:21.530
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't guys weren't sakes.</v>

749
00:34:21.610 --> 00:34:22.443
<v Speaker 3>It just that that ct has that Dan did on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Mongols is one of the greatest of </v>

750
00:34:26.231 --> 00:34:27.660
<v Speaker 3>all time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I urged me,</v>

<v Speaker 3>get it for a dollar or I don't know what</v>

<v Speaker 3>worth fucking hundreds of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>no one talked to me for a second.</v>

788
00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:02.520
<v Speaker 1>Let me try to process this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

789
00:36:02.521 --> 00:36:04.780
<v Speaker 1>like we had a great guide,</v>

791
00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:09.053
<v Speaker 1>He guides people in the meantime and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was just so excited to talk to me </v>

792
00:36:13.081 --> 00:36:14.620
<v Speaker 1>because I was so into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

793
00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:15.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because most of the time,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are just like barely curious </v>

795
00:36:17.821 --> 00:36:19.560
<v Speaker 1>about what he has to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

796
00:36:19.561 --> 00:36:20.394
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we talked about the significance of the </v>

797
00:36:21.841 --> 00:36:22.674
<v Speaker 1>pineal gland and the pine cone and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Vatican and he know he takes you </v>

798
00:36:26.731 --> 00:36:28.560
<v Speaker 1>on a tour of all the different </v>
<v Speaker 1>artifacts.</v>

799
00:36:29.010 --> 00:36:31.290
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a trip that I feel like,</v>

800
00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:33.353
<v Speaker 1>but just going there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the Vatican going near the </v>

801
00:36:35.971 --> 00:36:39.420
<v Speaker 1>coliseum was big too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But going to the Vatican and just seeing</v>

802
00:36:39.421 --> 00:36:40.254
<v Speaker 1>all that artwork and getting an </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding of what those people were </v>

803
00:36:43.081 --> 00:36:46.440
<v Speaker 1>really up to four hundreds and hundreds </v>
<v Speaker 1>of years,</v>

804
00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:47.513
<v Speaker 1>just conquering the world for hundreds </v>
<v Speaker 1>and hundreds of years and all this </v>

806
00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:54.900
<v Speaker 1>Seeing it live in person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just sort of reset my perspective.</v>

807
00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:55.793
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>

00:37:01.770 --> 00:37:05.130
<v Speaker 1>there's a place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sentence Santangelo's which is kind of</v>

813
00:37:05.131 --> 00:37:08.150
<v Speaker 1>close to the Vatican and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you go to the top of this castle,</v>

814
00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:09.013
<v Speaker 1>you're basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to panoramic view will fold off </v>

815
00:37:10.681 --> 00:37:13.330
<v Speaker 1>at all from there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so spectacular.</v>

816
00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:14.873
<v Speaker 1>It's wild river.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll see all the buildings you'll see </v>

817
00:37:17.161 --> 00:37:17.994
<v Speaker 1>every single,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you kind of like mech down and </v>

<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

820
00:37:23.341 --> 00:37:25.650
<v Speaker 1>one thing that I swear over that I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>blown away by,</v>

821
00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:26.731
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>desire,</v>

822
00:37:26.731 --> 00:37:31.410
<v Speaker 1>it tastes kind of a joe was the painter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never that guy.</v>

823
00:37:31.411 --> 00:37:32.244
<v Speaker 1>I love that guy because basically what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens with this dude is he was around </v>

824
00:37:35.071 --> 00:37:37.950
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was the end of the 59 yeah.</v>

825
00:37:37.951 --> 00:37:38.784
<v Speaker 1>I ended up the 59 [inaudible] 69 and </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of agile was straight up against </v>

826
00:37:42.901 --> 00:37:43.734
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he was probably the best artist of </v>

827
00:37:45.481 --> 00:37:46.314
<v Speaker 1>the arl to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's probably the best artist of all </v>

828
00:37:48.031 --> 00:37:48.601
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

829
00:37:48.601 --> 00:37:52.530
<v Speaker 1>you look at his paintings and it's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>insane what he could do with paint.</v>

830
00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:57.560
<v Speaker 1>But then he had this life on the street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>asic as electoral gains there.</v>

831
00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:00.700
<v Speaker 1>He would just get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he at one point killed the guy in a duel</v>

832
00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:01.613
<v Speaker 1>was wanted for barder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time he would get close to power </v>

833
00:38:05.311 --> 00:38:07.470
<v Speaker 1>and the will be up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of agile for you.</v>

834
00:38:07.471 --> 00:38:07.920
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

835
00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:11.540
<v Speaker 1>They're raising that painting is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what year was this made around?</v>

836
00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:14.100
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look how good it is.</v>

837
00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:15.870
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is insane.</v>

838
00:38:15.871 --> 00:38:20.871
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is so close to photographic and you</v>

839
00:38:22.441 --> 00:38:26.040
<v Speaker 1>think that this is in the 16 hundreds </v>
<v Speaker 1>and these people,</v>

840
00:38:26.070 --> 00:38:28.650
<v Speaker 1>they couldn't even stand still for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

841
00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:29.633
<v Speaker 1>how do you think he did that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did he have a guy pretend that he's </v>

842
00:38:31.441 --> 00:38:33.840
<v Speaker 1>getting choked?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did do this all from his mind?</v>

843
00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:35.180
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he was models.</v>

844
00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:38.980
<v Speaker 1>There was actually one of the scandals </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that he thinks in his models.</v>

845
00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:41.200
<v Speaker 1>Well of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that was not this guy.</v>

846
00:38:41.201 --> 00:38:41.890
<v Speaker 1>I'll do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

847
00:38:41.890 --> 00:38:44.800
<v Speaker 1>That was part of the deal though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that scandal power was the fact that,</v>

848
00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:45.653
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Church was commissioner in a lot of </v>

849
00:38:46.661 --> 00:38:47.494
<v Speaker 1>his work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's clearly was not the most pious </v>

850
00:38:49.601 --> 00:38:52.450
<v Speaker 1>guy in their sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's view of Christianity was a,</v>

851
00:38:52.451 --> 00:38:53.284
<v Speaker 1>hey these guys where Jesus and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>followers who were poor man from the </v>

852
00:38:56.711 --> 00:38:59.990
<v Speaker 1>street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were not the power Denali in purple</v>

853
00:38:59.991 --> 00:39:00.824
<v Speaker 1>the roads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he used the small dose more than </v>

854
00:39:03.461 --> 00:39:06.750
<v Speaker 1>Lance for the Virgin Mary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was the hoop so that he was leaping.</v>

855
00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:09.160
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a church is like,</v>

856
00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:11.710
<v Speaker 1>you're kind of dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a hooker for the Virgin Mary.</v>

857
00:39:11.711 --> 00:39:13.960
<v Speaker 1>That's just not okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would be like,</v>

858
00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:14.741
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't worry.</v>

859
00:39:14.741 --> 00:39:16.240
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next time and a gate.</v>

860
00:39:16.241 --> 00:39:17.700

<v Speaker 1>Some of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

863
00:39:21.551 --> 00:39:23.560
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hilarious.</v>

864
00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:24.580
<v Speaker 1>There's one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

870
00:39:38.201 --> 00:39:39.310
<v Speaker 1>and a church was trying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that staff and they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

878
00:39:59.831 --> 00:40:04.060
<v Speaker 1>that's not what we bet the one that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Virgin Mary.</v>

879
00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:05.920
<v Speaker 1>She looks like a freak.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well she was he so love or hooker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yes,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that was part of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are baby Jesus squash.</v>

882
00:40:12.831 --> 00:40:17.410
<v Speaker 1>The snake was dick show and fix that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the other thing that,</v>

883
00:40:17.411 --> 00:40:18.244
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy was explaining to me was a </v>

884
00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:20.673
<v Speaker 1>penis sizes of the Roman statues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were all small because big penises </v>

885
00:40:24.911 --> 00:40:29.911
<v Speaker 1>were supposed to mean stupid people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>like aggressive animals that were just,</v>

886
00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:32.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a part of the civilized,</v>

887
00:40:32.951 --> 00:40:37.120
<v Speaker 1>amazing culture that Rome represented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there was pride in the micro penis?</v>

888
00:40:37.121 --> 00:40:37.954
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it wasn't micro but it was </v>

889
00:40:38.921 --> 00:40:42.010
<v Speaker 1>definitely not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not optimal.</v>

890
00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:45.371
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>

891
00:40:45.371 --> 00:40:46.690
<v Speaker 1>cause I was asking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

892
00:40:46.691 --> 00:40:47.524
<v Speaker 1>what do you think that is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were trying to figure it out when we </v>

893
00:40:49.781 --> 00:40:50.614
<v Speaker 1>were talking about it before the </v>
<v Speaker 1>professor gave me an answer and I was </v>

894
00:40:52.601 --> 00:40:54.780
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they just like had little riddicks</v>

895
00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:56.590
<v Speaker 1>back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe it was just,</v>

896
00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:58.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was just how it went.</v>

897
00:40:58.750 --> 00:40:59.710
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

898
00:40:59.770 --> 00:41:00.603
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they probably associated with </v>

899
00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:05.240
<v Speaker 1>big dicks with rape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with like the,</v>

900
00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:06.083
<v Speaker 1>the barbarians and the Moore's and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these people coming in and chopping </v>

901
00:41:08.951 --> 00:41:11.410
<v Speaker 1>people up and fucking the shit out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody and like,</v>

902
00:41:11.411 --> 00:41:11.621
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

903
00:41:11.621 --> 00:41:12.520
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't want that.</v>

904
00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:13.953
<v Speaker 1>They don't want that little tiny dicks </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the sophisticated dicks Dick's and </v>

905
00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:20.640
<v Speaker 1>people who write poetry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vandalism.</v>

906
00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:23.950
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they still a big dicks though.</v>

907
00:41:23.951 --> 00:41:26.230
<v Speaker 1>They were there were clearly made by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>artist.</v>

908
00:41:26.231 --> 00:41:27.064
<v Speaker 1>One thing they did do though in certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>errors they covered the dicks with </v>

909
00:41:29.171 --> 00:41:30.004
<v Speaker 1>leaves and it wasn't initially what they</v>
<v Speaker 1>would do and they went back on a lot </v>

910
00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:34.490
<v Speaker 1>them and repurpose</v>

911
00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:35.323
<v Speaker 3>them and put new leaves over dicks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you know right now that are </v>

912
00:41:38.451 --> 00:41:41.870
<v Speaker 3>going to be about seven pank beds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boring the name from you,</v>

913
00:41:41.871 --> 00:41:46.160
<v Speaker 3>like sophisticated the will be the name </v>
<v Speaker 3>of new punk band coming out tomorrow.</v>

914
00:41:46.330 --> 00:41:47.900
<v Speaker 3>Good bands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sophisticated dicks.</v>

915
00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:50.290
<v Speaker 3>I like that name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good one.</v>

916
00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:50.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

917
00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:54.950
<v Speaker 3>it's a weird thing that people have done</v>
<v Speaker 3>throughout history.</v>

918
00:41:54.951 --> 00:41:58.250
<v Speaker 3>It's like sort of um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to uh,</v>

919
00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:03.940
<v Speaker 3>trying to control artistic expression </v>
<v Speaker 3>and trying to have it represent the time</v>

920
00:42:04.770 --> 00:42:09.740
<v Speaker 3>and so you don't necessarily get a full </v>
<v Speaker 3>version of what was going on then,</v>

921
00:42:09.741 --> 00:42:13.670
<v Speaker 3>but you do get a version of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>suppression which gives you insight into</v>

922
00:42:13.671 --> 00:42:15.880
<v Speaker 3>the full version of the times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Definitely.</v>

923
00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:16.820
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they were covering,</v>

924
00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:18.800
<v Speaker 3>covering Dick's with leaves and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

925
00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:22.360
<v Speaker 3>so strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And sometime they would have the pain 30</v>

926
00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:26.720
<v Speaker 3>giving the Dat third version of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>painting for public consumption.</v>

927
00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:29.150
<v Speaker 3>But then the same guy will commission.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>

928
00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:30.500
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>give me a while for my tribe.</v>

929
00:42:30.501 --> 00:42:31.334
<v Speaker 3>I call latch on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's where they would have all </v>

930
00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:35.360
<v Speaker 3>the way more explicit stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

931
00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:36.081
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

932
00:42:36.081 --> 00:42:36.914
<v Speaker 3>they didn't have pornography back then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they must been beaten off the </v>

933
00:42:39.651 --> 00:42:41.600
<v Speaker 3>paintings and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Had to be,</v>

934
00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:42.071
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

935
00:42:42.071 --> 00:42:45.190
<v Speaker 3>I mean it had to be thought of as being </v>
<v Speaker 3>arousal inducing.</v>

936
00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:46.033
<v Speaker 3>So much so that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was it during the Victorian era </v>

937
00:42:49.221 --> 00:42:53.060
<v Speaker 3>where they put legs of tables,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would put dresses on them.</v>

938
00:42:53.330 --> 00:42:54.163
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would rapid the legs of the tables </v>

939
00:42:55.581 --> 00:42:57.380
<v Speaker 3>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are legs each day.</v>

940
00:42:57.390 --> 00:42:59.040
<v Speaker 3>Our Bayer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they may give you ID.</v>

941
00:42:59.041 --> 00:43:00.500
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which I don't know about you man.</v>

942
00:43:00.501 --> 00:43:02.130
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at the leg of that.</v>

943
00:43:02.190 --> 00:43:03.023
<v Speaker 3>That really doesn't do wait for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the something to it where people got </v>

944
00:43:06.201 --> 00:43:08.720
<v Speaker 3>so horny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the table leg,</v>

945
00:43:09.050 --> 00:43:10.920
<v Speaker 3>this skin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

946
00:43:11.090 --> 00:43:13.010
<v Speaker 3>but that's what your door,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll really have problems,</v>

947
00:43:13.011 --> 00:43:13.310
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

948
00:43:13.310 --> 00:43:15.800
<v Speaker 3>When you look at the leg of a table and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you got all excited,</v>

949
00:43:15.801 --> 00:43:16.634
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

950
00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:19.040
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not good.</v>

951
00:43:19.070 --> 00:43:20.120
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll be whatever.</v>

952
00:43:20.190 --> 00:43:22.690
<v Speaker 3>Revies each your life choice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's up until that point.</v>

953
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.280
<v Speaker 3>It's fascinating to see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People must've agreed to that too.</v>

954
00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:26.900
<v Speaker 3>What's up Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just looked it up.</v>

955
00:43:26.901 --> 00:43:27.734
<v Speaker 3>It says it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it originates from a satire that </v>

956
00:43:29.661 --> 00:43:32.570
<v Speaker 3>was written and people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess took it as truth.</v>

957
00:43:32.590 --> 00:43:33.530
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's not real.</v>

958
00:43:33.590 --> 00:43:34.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I supposedly not,</v>

959
00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:36.710
<v Speaker 3>but they definitely did cover the legs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They did.</v>

960
00:43:36.711 --> 00:43:37.544
<v Speaker 3>But the reason why this exaggerated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>since he was poking fun at Americans </v>

961
00:43:40.581 --> 00:43:43.010
<v Speaker 3>that did something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll come up to this point of the meat.</v>

962
00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:47.660
<v Speaker 3>The meat is too cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's prosperous farmhouse parlor in 19</v>

963
00:43:47.661 --> 00:43:50.810
<v Speaker 3>hundreds and that isn't covered,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is 19 hundreds,</v>

964
00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:52.430
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

965
00:43:52.431 --> 00:43:55.310
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Victorian era is when they did this.</v>

966
00:43:56.210 --> 00:43:56.930
<v Speaker 3>Oh wait.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

967
00:43:56.930 --> 00:44:01.070
<v Speaker 3>1839 and Englishman wrote a satire of </v>
<v Speaker 3>American tour.</v>

968
00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:05.270
<v Speaker 3>He wrote the American propensity to use </v>
<v Speaker 3>the word limb and place of leg though he</v>

969
00:44:05.271 --> 00:44:06.104
<v Speaker 3>says the English two a two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then he says that he visited a boarding </v>

970
00:44:08.001 --> 00:44:08.960
<v Speaker 3>school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>young ladies,</v>

971
00:44:08.961 --> 00:44:09.441
<v Speaker 3>New York Strip,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

972
00:44:09.441 --> 00:44:12.140
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>square piano forte with four limbs.</v>

973
00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:13.393
<v Speaker 3>Their mistress of the establishment had </v>
<v Speaker 3>dressed all these four limbs in modest </v>

974
00:44:17.181 --> 00:44:19.580
<v Speaker 3>trousers with frills at the bottom of </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

975
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:23.020
<v Speaker 3>He's exaggerating or not subjects,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

976
00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:26.780
<v Speaker 3>is exaggerating or not subject to </v>
<v Speaker 3>speculation.</v>

977
00:44:26.781 --> 00:44:27.614
<v Speaker 3>He certainly poking fun or whether </v>
<v Speaker 3>whether Mur Mur Mur yet is exaggerating </v>

978
00:44:33.150 --> 00:44:33.983
<v Speaker 3>or not is subject to speculation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He is certainly poking fun and </v>

979
00:44:36.871 --> 00:44:37.704
<v Speaker 3>Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I can attest that having page who </v>

980
00:44:39.181 --> 00:44:40.014
<v Speaker 3>dozens of books showing old black and </v>
<v Speaker 3>white piano photos of Victorian tier is </v>

981
00:44:42.751 --> 00:44:43.584
<v Speaker 3>a saw not one example of a table piano </v>
<v Speaker 3>or any other piece of furniture with </v>

982
00:44:47.791 --> 00:44:49.560
<v Speaker 3>skirts around the individual legs.</v>

983
00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:51.030
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>

984
00:44:51.810 --> 00:44:52.643
<v Speaker 3>I liked the legends so much matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hadn't you always heard that from </v>

985
00:44:56.130 --> 00:44:56.963
<v Speaker 3>professors?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember hearing that from a history </v>

986
00:44:59.641 --> 00:45:01.890
<v Speaker 3>professor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm old off the,</v>

987
00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:04.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>between boring he story and a fun legend</v>

988
00:45:04.651 --> 00:45:06.890
<v Speaker 3>or west side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

989
00:45:06.891 --> 00:45:09.090
<v Speaker 3>I would like to think that people were </v>
<v Speaker 3>way more stupid than they were.</v>

990
00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:11.880
<v Speaker 3>It makes me feel good about this error.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

991
00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:13.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd be this,</v>

992
00:45:13.630 --> 00:45:14.463
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you look at the dresses that </v>

993
00:45:16.081 --> 00:45:18.480
<v Speaker 3>people had to wear that when all the way</v>
<v Speaker 3>down to the ground.</v>

994
00:45:18.660 --> 00:45:19.493
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not really much different than </v>

995
00:45:21.391 --> 00:45:24.060
<v Speaker 3>what we see in the Middle East.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very simple.</v>

996
00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:25.980
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we see in the Middle East,</v>

997
00:45:25.981 --> 00:45:26.814
<v Speaker 3>they have to cover their face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had job and the whole deal and the </v>

998
00:45:28.830 --> 00:45:30.870
<v Speaker 3>headscarves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's a little,</v>

999
00:45:30.930 --> 00:45:32.670
<v Speaker 3>little more extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not much.</v>

1000
00:45:32.671 --> 00:45:33.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they,</v>

1001
00:45:33.850 --> 00:45:36.300
<v Speaker 3>they wore shit that went all the way to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ground.</v>

1002
00:45:36.301 --> 00:45:39.030
<v Speaker 3>If you showed any ankle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would lose their mind and said,</v>

1003
00:45:39.031 --> 00:45:39.610
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>call,</v>

1004
00:45:39.610 --> 00:45:41.240
<v Speaker 3>why am I crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1005
00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:42.361
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1006
00:45:42.361 --> 00:45:44.430
<v Speaker 3>repetition does it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1007
00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:47.970
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if they were more </v>
<v Speaker 3>hypersexualized than we are.</v>

1008
00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:49.013
<v Speaker 3>I bet not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet because of porn we're probably </v>

1009
00:45:50.611 --> 00:45:51.930
<v Speaker 3>more hypersexualized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1010
00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:52.823
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think different arguments there </v>

1011
00:45:53.851 --> 00:45:55.910
<v Speaker 3>because some people say the more </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] stuff,</v>

1012
00:45:55.950 --> 00:45:57.600
<v Speaker 3>the more than you're going to obsess </v>
<v Speaker 3>with it.</v>

1013
00:45:57.601 --> 00:46:01.820
<v Speaker 3>So that's all you think about all day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible]</v>

1014
00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:04.050
<v Speaker 3>he's less likely to obsess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then again,</v>

1015
00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:07.170
<v Speaker 3>there are lots of people are so addicted</v>
<v Speaker 3>to Internet porn that,</v>

1016
00:46:07.171 --> 00:46:09.240
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that the idea works,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1017
00:46:09.270 --> 00:46:10.860
<v Speaker 3>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1018
00:46:10.861 --> 00:46:12.840
<v Speaker 3>Internet porn is the problem that </v>
<v Speaker 3>Annette porn is,</v>

1019
00:46:12.841 --> 00:46:16.170
<v Speaker 3>the availability is this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't even have to go some way.</v>

1020
00:46:16.410 --> 00:46:17.243
<v Speaker 3>At least back in the day when you had </v>
<v Speaker 3>vhs tapes or dvds or something like </v>

1021
00:46:20.851 --> 00:46:22.710
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you had to go to a store,</v>

1022
00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:23.753
<v Speaker 3>you had to buy him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had to put them into the TV at a sit </v>

1023
00:46:25.551 --> 00:46:26.170
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1024
00:46:26.170 --> 00:46:28.230
<v Speaker 3>Get the remote control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1025
00:46:28.231 --> 00:46:30.520
<v Speaker 3>There's a process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was work involved.</v>

1026
00:46:30.650 --> 00:46:33.170
<v Speaker 3>The miners have minor work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1027
00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:36.550
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now it's just far too easy as far.</v>

1028
00:46:36.690 --> 00:46:39.780
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many people that work that have jobs</v>

1029
00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:42.180
<v Speaker 3>go into the bathroom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>locked the door and beat off.</v>

1030
00:46:43.460 --> 00:46:45.450
<v Speaker 3>That's a lot of people listening right </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

1031
00:46:45.730 --> 00:46:48.480
<v Speaker 3>Where do we did exactly that and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now you're beaten off right now.</v>

1032
00:46:49.110 --> 00:46:51.030
<v Speaker 3>Stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go back to work.</v>

1033
00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:52.770
<v Speaker 3>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's watching.</v>

1034
00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:55.050
<v Speaker 3>That's what I hear.</v>

1036
00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:58.770
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess if you have to think about it.</v>

1037
00:46:58.771 --> 00:47:03.300
<v Speaker 3>Like they were trying to control those </v>
<v Speaker 3>people and trying to control their urges</v>

1038
00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:07.060
<v Speaker 3>because it was beneficial to society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was beneficial to society that,</v>

1039
00:47:07.061 --> 00:47:07.894
<v Speaker 3>that these people needed to do their </v>
<v Speaker 3>fair share and get to work and they </v>

1040
00:47:10.951 --> 00:47:12.960

<v Speaker 3>human mind works is you do not say no to</v>

<v Speaker 1>drinking at 21 in us.</v>

1070
00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:24.850
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like growing up.</v>

1071
00:48:24.851 --> 00:48:28.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know if there was an age in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Italy where you're supposed to not drink</v>

1072
00:48:29.530 --> 00:48:31.600
<v Speaker 1>but is not that glamorous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1073
00:48:31.601 --> 00:48:32.434
<v Speaker 1>is what your grandparents have for lunch</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know you are maybe six year old </v>

1074
00:48:35.351 --> 00:48:36.184
<v Speaker 1>and you want to try a little wine and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they give you a tiny bit saying if you </v>

1075
00:48:39.071 --> 00:48:41.300
<v Speaker 1>have a little more you got a headache.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just got it.</v>

1076
00:48:41.470 --> 00:48:43.150
<v Speaker 1>And then one day you do get a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>more,</v>

1077
00:48:43.151 --> 00:48:44.740
<v Speaker 1>you got a headache and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh shit,</v>

1078
00:48:44.741 --> 00:48:45.760
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1079
00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:50.890
<v Speaker 1>And you kind of learn how to drink </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than being like wait God away.</v>

1080
00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:51.813
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we got all this booze and people </v>

1081
00:48:53.291 --> 00:48:55.330
<v Speaker 1>drink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Throw up all over themselves is like,</v>

1082
00:48:55.630 --> 00:48:57.300
<v Speaker 1>that hasn't got a hose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are you doing?</v>

1083
00:48:57.540 --> 00:48:58.373
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's definitely a healthier </v>

1084
00:49:00.371 --> 00:49:02.680
<v Speaker 1>attitudes than Americans' attitudes </v>
<v Speaker 1>about alcohol,</v>

1085
00:49:02.770 --> 00:49:05.740
<v Speaker 1>but also like wine is a good way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>start.</v>

1086
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:06.833
<v Speaker 1>Like he started off a kid with whiskey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not the way to start as too </v>

1087
00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:11.633
<v Speaker 1>potent amount of my first times I ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>got drunk was on Jack Daniels until </v>

1088
00:49:14.321 --> 00:49:17.720
<v Speaker 1>years for me to smell Jack Daniel's and </v>
<v Speaker 1>not want to throw up.</v>

1089
00:49:17.721 --> 00:49:21.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure he gets those triggers in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

1090
00:49:21.011 --> 00:49:22.800
<v Speaker 1>We smell it like Jaeger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>

1091
00:49:22.830 --> 00:49:24.230
<v Speaker 1>I used to smell yeager mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1092
00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:26.540
<v Speaker 1>and just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

1093
00:49:26.990 --> 00:49:27.823
<v Speaker 1>It's just think about just getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>violently ill where your body's trying </v>

1094
00:49:30.911 --> 00:49:34.000
<v Speaker 1>to purge it from your system so you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't die yet.</v>

1095
00:49:34.060 --> 00:49:34.893
<v Speaker 1>It's to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to hide it from kids and tell them it's </v>

1096
00:49:37.331 --> 00:49:38.530
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's taboo,</v>

1097
00:49:38.531 --> 00:49:40.690
<v Speaker 1>but then you drank it and then they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1098
00:49:40.691 --> 00:49:44.290
<v Speaker 1>I can't wait until these fucking people </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't tell me what to do anymore to help</v>

1099
00:49:44.291 --> 00:49:46.530
<v Speaker 1>get myself a nice cold glass of whiskey.</v>

1100
00:49:46.750 --> 00:49:47.583
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's kind of like that goes over </v>

1101
00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:51.430
<v Speaker 1>to this to education in general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know when,</v>

1102
00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:55.510
<v Speaker 1>if a parent has to come to the place </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you say these are the rules,</v>

1103
00:49:55.511 --> 00:49:57.610
<v Speaker 1>you live under my roof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to pay them.</v>

1104
00:49:57.640 --> 00:49:59.920
<v Speaker 1>That's like raising the white flag and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that meeting,</v>

1105
00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:01.900
<v Speaker 1>I've lost all that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lost control.</v>

1106
00:50:01.901 --> 00:50:02.734
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the fuck I'm doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>cause it's like of course all the are </v>

1107
00:50:05.081 --> 00:50:05.914
<v Speaker 1>going to do is wait for you to turn </v>
<v Speaker 1>around and do exactly the senior </v>

1108
00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:10.540
<v Speaker 1>prohibiting cause they are coming across</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a dictator.</v>

1109
00:50:10.570 --> 00:50:14.650
<v Speaker 1>You're coming across as an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If instead you can teach somebody like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Get out of that liquor cabinet.</v>

1132
00:51:02.340 --> 00:51:03.380
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1133
00:51:03.381 --> 00:51:04.970
<v Speaker 3>I remember when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't wait to drink.</v>

1134
00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:06.800
<v Speaker 3>It has the course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is going to be fun.</v>

1135
00:51:06.830 --> 00:51:08.600
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gotta be this taboo.</v>

1136
00:51:08.660 --> 00:51:09.710
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's forbidden.</v>

1137
00:51:09.770 --> 00:51:10.630
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1138
00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:13.280
<v Speaker 3>but that's the problem that we'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>forbidden stuff.</v>

1139
00:51:13.730 --> 00:51:14.563
<v Speaker 3>It never works well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also a Italian food and wine seem </v>

1140
00:51:18.801 --> 00:51:22.090
<v Speaker 3>to go hand in hand and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>

1141
00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:23.391
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1142
00:51:23.391 --> 00:51:28.250
<v Speaker 3>did they used to be what they drank </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they were concerned with getting</v>

1143
00:51:28.251 --> 00:51:29.084
<v Speaker 3>sick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1144
00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:32.270
<v Speaker 3>And one of the best ways to not get sick</v>
<v Speaker 3>was to drink wine.</v>

1145
00:51:32.510 --> 00:51:33.343
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because,</v>

1146
00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:34.431
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1147
00:51:34.431 --> 00:51:36.740
<v Speaker 3>the alcohol content would keep the water</v>
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>

1148
00:51:36.770 --> 00:51:38.690
<v Speaker 3>I mean like if you just drink water all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the time,</v>

1149
00:51:38.691 --> 00:51:42.470
<v Speaker 3>especially if it's sitting still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could get some bad fucking water.</v>

1150
00:51:42.471 --> 00:51:44.060
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can get bad water from a lake.</v>

1151
00:51:44.061 --> 00:51:44.894
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many,</v>

1152
00:51:44.930 --> 00:51:47.150
<v Speaker 3>they didn't know Jack Shit about </v>
<v Speaker 3>parasites back then.</v>

1153
00:51:47.151 --> 00:51:47.984
<v Speaker 3>How many people got some terrible </v>
<v Speaker 3>diseases from drinking puddle water and </v>

1154
00:51:50.841 --> 00:51:51.471
<v Speaker 3>shit?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1155
00:51:51.471 --> 00:51:52.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1156
00:51:52.911 --> 00:51:54.440
<v Speaker 3>He just find some water like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1158
00:51:54.980 --> 00:51:55.813
<v Speaker 3>Time to drink.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or even at creek you drink in a creek </v>

1159
00:51:58.791 --> 00:51:59.601
<v Speaker 3>and you think like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1160
00:51:59.601 --> 00:52:02.300
<v Speaker 3>this is a beautiful stream.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a clear water.</v>

1161
00:52:02.301 --> 00:52:03.134
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But a beaver took a shit just a hundred </v>

1162
00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:07.720
<v Speaker 3>yards of so that you don't know about </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1163
00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:10.940
<v Speaker 3>You get what's called beaver fever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what you're for real.</v>

1164
00:52:10.941 --> 00:52:14.150
<v Speaker 3>That's what they called Giardia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They call it beaver fever.</v>

1165
00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:15.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That can be good.</v>

1166
00:52:15.230 --> 00:52:16.063
<v Speaker 3>Now it's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they used to drink wine to prevent </v>

1167
00:52:18.411 --> 00:52:22.700
<v Speaker 3>what they would call traveler's disease </v>
<v Speaker 3>because people would take these,</v>

1168
00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:25.190
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are those things called?</v>

1169
00:52:25.230 --> 00:52:26.063
<v Speaker 3>The leather things that they would carry</v>
<v Speaker 3>wine and I want to say flask but it's </v>

1170
00:52:28.791 --> 00:52:30.200
<v Speaker 3>not a flask.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of those,</v>

1171
00:52:30.210 --> 00:52:32.680
<v Speaker 3>those leather satchels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they know what they're about.</v>

1172
00:52:33.010 --> 00:52:35.900
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] I thought they use </v>
<v Speaker 3>philosopher dots but I'm not sure.</v>

1173
00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:36.953
<v Speaker 3>It might be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a term it's like a leather bag </v>

1174
00:52:40.790 --> 00:52:45.380
<v Speaker 3>and it had like a on the end like a cork</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they just drink from that and that's</v>

1175
00:52:45.381 --> 00:52:46.400
<v Speaker 3>how they would hydrate.</v>

1176
00:52:46.490 --> 00:52:47.323
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People must have been just hammered all </v>

1177
00:52:49.010 --> 00:52:52.610
<v Speaker 3>day when you read the statistics of how </v>
<v Speaker 3>much people used to drink.</v>

1178
00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:53.533
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing that anything got article </v>
<v Speaker 3>done cause it's just people where that </v>

1179
00:52:56.751 --> 00:52:57.584
<v Speaker 3>ain't good morning through night and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they must have been horrific to each </v>

1180
00:53:00.831 --> 00:53:01.664
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then just just to imagine like a whole </v>

1181
00:53:04.431 --> 00:53:09.200
<v Speaker 3>civilization that is a drunken bar at </v>
<v Speaker 3>1:00 AM angry drunk you.</v>

1182
00:53:09.210 --> 00:53:10.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's funny cause I never,</v>

1183
00:53:11.090 --> 00:53:12.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean I've seen it enough that I get </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1184
00:53:12.891 --> 00:53:17.891
<v Speaker 3>People get edgy and weird where when day</v>
<v Speaker 3>drink too much,</v>

1185
00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:18.853
<v Speaker 3>but I never got it because to me it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like if I'm drunk he like that's when </v>

1186
00:53:21.441 --> 00:53:23.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to tag people.</v>

1187
00:53:23.540 --> 00:53:26.030
<v Speaker 3>Why would I be in a bad mood is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This for,</v>

1188
00:53:26.030 --> 00:53:28.200
<v Speaker 1>you're a nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>

1189
00:53:28.201 --> 00:53:30.300
<v Speaker 1>That comes out the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1190
00:53:30.301 --> 00:53:31.780
<v Speaker 1>If you're a fucking asshole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1191
00:53:31.890 --> 00:53:33.450
<v Speaker 1>she'll drop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

1192
00:53:33.630 --> 00:53:36.690
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you just barely keep in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that ass hole under the surface,</v>

1193
00:53:36.691 --> 00:53:39.210
<v Speaker 1>just barely just wondering science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stab her,</v>

1194
00:53:39.220 --> 00:53:40.053
<v Speaker 1>but in club them and steal their women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you get a couple of drinks in </v>

1195
00:53:43.231 --> 00:53:45.400
<v Speaker 1>you and this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is alcohol.</v>

1196
00:53:45.430 --> 00:53:50.430
<v Speaker 1>Alcohol is a great social lubricant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's great for releasing inhibitions and</v>

1197
00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:54.090
<v Speaker 1>letting people communicate with each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other more freely and have fun.</v>

1198
00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:59.540
<v Speaker 1>But it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it removes doubt and that's not good.</v>

1199
00:54:01.670 --> 00:54:02.503
<v Speaker 1>I think town is critical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like doubt is one of the pieces of the </v>

1200
00:54:06.060 --> 00:54:07.540
<v Speaker 1>great puzzle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1201
00:54:07.541 --> 00:54:08.374
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the great puzzle has many ingredients </v>

1202
00:54:09.811 --> 00:54:12.510
<v Speaker 1>and one of those ingredients is doubt </v>
<v Speaker 1>and doubt is important.</v>

1203
00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:17.790
<v Speaker 1>You should look at anything you're about</v>
<v Speaker 1>to contemplate and go think about this.</v>

1204
00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:21.150
<v Speaker 1>Let me think what could go wrong when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a couple of drinks.</v>

1205
00:54:21.150 --> 00:54:22.200
<v Speaker 1>Fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's do it.</v>

1206
00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:24.750
<v Speaker 1>Let's go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then next thing you know,</v>

1207
00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:27.200
<v Speaker 1>you know you're on an Internet meme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hold my beer.</v>

1208
00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:28.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1209
00:54:28.261 --> 00:54:29.094
<v Speaker 1>We talked about that yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like some of the most more ridiculous </v>

1210
00:54:30.781 --> 00:54:31.614
<v Speaker 1>ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's so many of those out there </v>

1211
00:54:32.910 --> 00:54:34.830
<v Speaker 1>and almost all of them I have to do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol.</v>

1212
00:54:34.831 --> 00:54:35.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1213
00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:38.330
<v Speaker 1>you are totally right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think what you saying about dove,</v>

1214
00:54:38.380 --> 00:54:42.870
<v Speaker 1>there's a great Alan Watts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy who polarizes an and that weighs</v>

1215
00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:43.740
<v Speaker 1>in Mendota,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that stuff.</v>

1216
00:54:43.770 --> 00:54:47.100
<v Speaker 1>He had these good eighth line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he called it the wisdom of insecurity.</v>

1217
00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:51.270
<v Speaker 1>These idl that I had to re careful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lease,</v>

1218
00:54:51.271 --> 00:54:52.104
<v Speaker 1>don't dairy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not being sure he'd dogmatic and which </v>

1219
00:54:54.661 --> 00:54:55.494
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean the problem is then people </v>
<v Speaker 1>take that concept to fire and that </v>

1220
00:54:58.710 --> 00:55:01.980
<v Speaker 1>donating to having no bowls and not </v>
<v Speaker 1>being able to pick a standard.</v>

1221
00:55:02.010 --> 00:55:03.120
<v Speaker 1>That's not a solution either.</v>

1222
00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:03.953
<v Speaker 1>That's the other side of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's a sweet spot in between </v>

1223
00:55:07.201 --> 00:55:11.070
<v Speaker 1>where you can take stances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they are careful statuses.</v>

1224
00:55:11.100 --> 00:55:11.933
<v Speaker 1>They are sent stances that are very </v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to be change at the drop of a </v>

1225
00:55:14.611 --> 00:55:17.370
<v Speaker 1>dime if you show the good evidence to to</v>
<v Speaker 1>change them.</v>

1226
00:55:17.371 --> 00:55:18.350
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

1227
00:55:18.630 --> 00:55:21.330
<v Speaker 1>that to me is what the intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 1>honesty looks like,</v>

1228
00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:22.381
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1229
00:55:22.381 --> 00:55:26.250
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's good to be aware of all the</v>

1230
00:55:26.251 --> 00:55:27.084
<v Speaker 1>possibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to tell people that when I was a </v>

1231
00:55:29.310 --> 00:55:30.143
<v Speaker 1>teaching taekwondo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people that would compete if there </v>

1232
00:55:32.501 --> 00:55:33.510
<v Speaker 1>were really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really nervous,</v>

1233
00:55:33.511 --> 00:55:34.344
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like the really smart people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>really nervous because you're aware of </v>

1234
00:55:38.101 --> 00:55:40.710
<v Speaker 1>all the possibilities of everything that</v>
<v Speaker 1>could go wrong.</v>

1235
00:55:40.890 --> 00:55:43.050
<v Speaker 1>The people that aren't worried about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>at all,</v>

1236
00:55:43.290 --> 00:55:46.050
<v Speaker 1>they're usually dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's that,</v>

1237
00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:46.913
<v Speaker 1>but also to me there are some people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I look at some of the people were </v>

1238
00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:53.020
<v Speaker 1>able to keep it together in this like </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of like Chuck [inaudible],</v>

1239
00:55:53.030 --> 00:55:53.220
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1240
00:55:53.220 --> 00:55:55.200
<v Speaker 1>Take a nap right before a fight kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1241
00:55:55.770 --> 00:55:58.110
<v Speaker 1>I can't tell by looking at those guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>and just be like,</v>

1242
00:55:58.260 --> 00:55:59.093
<v Speaker 1>you'd have something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what you know there's </v>

1243
00:56:00.331 --> 00:56:03.000
<v Speaker 1>something there that you are doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Confidence for sure.</v>

1244
00:56:03.001 --> 00:56:05.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean chuck had been knocking people </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious for many,</v>

1245
00:56:05.221 --> 00:56:08.760
<v Speaker 1>many years and he knew exactly what to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do and I think knew he was good at it.</v>

1246
00:56:08.761 --> 00:56:09.594
<v Speaker 1>There's that for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think there's the other side is </v>

1247
00:56:11.131 --> 00:56:12.160
<v Speaker 1>knowing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1248
00:56:12.161 --> 00:56:12.994
<v Speaker 1>if I have decided to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fear is not going to help me now you </v>

1249
00:56:15.750 --> 00:56:17.610
<v Speaker 1>know that me to make decisions so </v>
<v Speaker 1>earlier,</v>

1250
00:56:17.611 --> 00:56:19.950
<v Speaker 1>but right now he's not going to help me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's figure out,</v>

1251
00:56:20.340 --> 00:56:21.210
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was hilarious.</v>

<v Speaker 1>she's wise man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>She said she lita Lee at that chuck </v>

1257
00:56:35.861 --> 00:56:36.694

<v Speaker 1>she took a nap right before a fight and </v>

<v Speaker 1>like 45 minutes before you have to wake </v>

<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1261
00:56:44.290 --> 00:56:45.940
<v Speaker 1>ready to roll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

1262
00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:50.470
<v Speaker 1>I would not sleep for a week prior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you manage to keep it together?</v>

1263
00:56:50.690 --> 00:56:52.180
<v Speaker 1>Kids do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to do that.</v>

1264
00:56:52.181 --> 00:56:54.100
<v Speaker 1>I used to sleep before fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>

1265
00:56:54.130 --> 00:56:55.180
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1266
00:56:55.190 --> 00:56:56.023
<v Speaker 1>But you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just can get yourself into a more </v>

1267
00:56:58.271 --> 00:57:02.260
<v Speaker 1>calm state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so much better than I'm frantically</v>

1268
00:57:02.261 --> 00:57:05.250
<v Speaker 1>running around and freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Threading plus is a,</v>

1269
00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:06.730
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it freaks out your opponents.</v>

1270
00:57:06.731 --> 00:57:08.470
<v Speaker 1>I would sleep like right in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bleachers.</v>

1271
00:57:08.890 --> 00:57:09.723
<v Speaker 1>I just go to sleep right there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody else would be nervous and </v>

1272
00:57:11.801 --> 00:57:12.760
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're sleeping.</v>

1273
00:57:12.790 --> 00:57:13.623
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you look at them and then I'm </v>

1274
00:57:14.650 --> 00:57:15.483
<v Speaker 1>supposed to fight that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy was leaping right before the </v>

1275
00:57:17.381 --> 00:57:18.640
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hell No.</v>

1276
00:57:18.641 --> 00:57:22.180
<v Speaker 1>Like the first to match studied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was nuts because you know,</v>

1277
00:57:22.181 --> 00:57:26.110
<v Speaker 1>you're in the locker room and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy sitting next to you goes out for</v>

1278
00:57:26.111 --> 00:57:27.460
<v Speaker 1>his match.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come right back.</v>

1279
00:57:27.610 --> 00:57:30.110
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

1280
00:57:30.130 --> 00:57:31.840
<v Speaker 1>you get ready,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going next.</v>

1281
00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:33.780
<v Speaker 1>And I'm dying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1282
00:57:33.790 --> 00:57:37.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm just seeking out to hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she's all like la La la.</v>

1283
00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:39.820
<v Speaker 1>Where'd you meet her gym?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1284
00:57:39.890 --> 00:57:40.723
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She literally live across the street </v>

1285
00:57:41.651 --> 00:57:42.790
<v Speaker 1>from me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

1286
00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:45.970
<v Speaker 1>And it was funny because I used to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1287
00:57:46.030 --> 00:57:47.890
<v Speaker 1>this is where the universe as a sense of</v>
<v Speaker 1>humor,</v>

1288
00:57:47.891 --> 00:57:50.470
<v Speaker 1>because I used to say all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'm kind of,</v>

1289
00:57:51.340 --> 00:57:55.030
<v Speaker 1>I can get along with anybody but I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily click with a lot of people.</v>

1290
00:57:55.031 --> 00:57:56.020
<v Speaker 1>So my thing was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1291
00:57:56.021 --> 00:57:58.600
<v Speaker 1>where do I find somebody?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I click with Laura across the street and</v>

1292
00:57:58.601 --> 00:57:59.434
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like pen pals and dies right at </v>

1293
00:58:01.090 --> 00:58:02.640
<v Speaker 1>what they have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like look at that.</v>

1294
00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:04.193
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know he was looking at the universe </v>

1295
00:58:06.971 --> 00:58:08.050
<v Speaker 1>going like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1296
00:58:08.080 --> 00:58:09.100
<v Speaker 1>that's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ha ha,</v>

1297
00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:10.113
<v Speaker 1>but the this definitely like little </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that almost like slap you in the </v>

1298
00:58:13.931 --> 00:58:15.070
<v Speaker 1>face with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1299
00:58:15.071 --> 00:58:16.600
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole system going on.</v>

1300
00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:18.520
<v Speaker 1>Stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just pay attention.</v>

1301
00:58:19.250 --> 00:58:20.083
<v Speaker 1>Like I know you make fun of Oprah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the secret might be real mother </v>

1302
00:58:23.381 --> 00:58:25.240
<v Speaker 1>fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oprah has got $3 billion.</v>

1303
00:58:26.210 --> 00:58:31.210
<v Speaker 1>See it his way to do it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems completely preposterous,</v>

1304
00:58:31.241 --> 00:58:35.530
<v Speaker 1>but yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Intellectually I always want to say Nah.</v>

1305
00:58:35.770 --> 00:58:36.603
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then things don't happen for a fucking </v>

1306
00:58:37.931 --> 00:58:38.764
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You decide they happen for a reason </v>

1307
00:58:39.821 --> 00:58:40.720
<v Speaker 1>afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1308
00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:42.370
<v Speaker 1>because it helps fit your sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>order.</v>

1309
00:58:42.790 --> 00:58:43.623
<v Speaker 1>It's the funny thing is I completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>agree with that and I also completely </v>

1310
00:58:47.021 --> 00:58:49.180
<v Speaker 1>agree with the fact that sometimes sinks</v>
<v Speaker 1>clicking away.</v>

1311
00:58:49.181 --> 00:58:50.080
<v Speaker 1>Then you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1312
00:58:50.110 --> 00:58:53.170
<v Speaker 1>you're a fucking wait to meet these is </v>
<v Speaker 1>just to think about people all the time.</v>

1313
00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:54.033
<v Speaker 1>Out of nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll get an email from him like out of </v>

1314
00:58:56.081 --> 00:58:56.914
<v Speaker 1>nowhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I haven't talked to this guy in 10 </v>

1315
00:58:57.791 --> 00:59:01.300
<v Speaker 1>fucking years and then all of sudden I </v>
<v Speaker 1>get an email or you know,</v>

1316
00:59:01.690 --> 00:59:03.460
<v Speaker 1>you run into them somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what?</v>

1317
00:59:03.750 --> 00:59:05.740
<v Speaker 1>How is it possible I'm running into at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the airport?</v>

1318
00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:08.560
<v Speaker 1>Like this doesn't even make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you reconnect.</v>

1319
00:59:08.940 --> 00:59:10.370
<v Speaker 1>It's very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1320
00:59:10.630 --> 00:59:14.560
<v Speaker 1>there those are the times when he really</v>
<v Speaker 1>humbles you and makes you think,</v>

1321
00:59:14.561 --> 00:59:15.394
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the university such a weird place and </v>

1322
00:59:17.111 --> 00:59:21.380
<v Speaker 1>what I understand he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but release 0.01% of what's out there.</v>

1323
00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:22.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1324
00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:22.903
<v Speaker 3>We're connected in some other weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bizarre way that we haven't figured out </v>

1325
00:59:25.581 --> 00:59:29.160
<v Speaker 3>yet and maybe we'll never will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we'll become symbiotics.</v>

1326
00:59:29.450 --> 00:59:30.283
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it will become like completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>ingrained technologically before we </v>

1327
00:59:32.841 --> 00:59:36.350
<v Speaker 3>figure out the biological connections </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we share because I think there's,</v>

1328
00:59:36.890 --> 00:59:38.930
<v Speaker 3>I think there's like the obvious senses </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we all have,</v>

1329
00:59:39.110 --> 00:59:40.640
<v Speaker 3>but I think there's some other stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>going on.</v>

1330
00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:42.260
<v Speaker 3>When you think about someone and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>

1331
00:59:42.340 --> 00:59:43.173
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're calling you on the phone like </v>

1332
00:59:44.031 --> 00:59:45.080
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dad,</v>

1333
00:59:45.110 --> 00:59:49.100
<v Speaker 3>just to me is too coincidental </v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes.</v>

1334
00:59:49.370 --> 00:59:50.710
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it's random.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1335
00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:54.320
<v Speaker 3>Like say if it's someone that you talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>to all the time and then they call you,</v>

1336
00:59:54.430 --> 00:59:58.130
<v Speaker 3>that's just coincidental.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's some times man,</v>

1337
00:59:58.550 --> 01:00:01.180
<v Speaker 3>where you just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about someone and also in</v>

1338
01:00:01.181 --> 01:00:03.140
<v Speaker 3>the fucking phone rings and I go look at</v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

1339
01:00:03.141 --> 01:00:04.340
<v Speaker 3>This is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

1340
01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:06.980
<v Speaker 3>You haven't talked to them at four years</v>
<v Speaker 3>exact calling you right there.</v>

1341
01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.690
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's something to that.</v>

1342
01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:09.620
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they,</v>

1343
01:00:09.621 --> 01:00:10.970
<v Speaker 3>and you asked them like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why did you call me?</v>

1344
01:00:11.030 --> 01:00:12.950
<v Speaker 3>Just stop right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>

1345
01:00:12.951 --> 01:00:14.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why are you calling me?</v>

1346
01:00:14.930 --> 01:00:17.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying like what was going on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what caused you to call me?</v>

1347
01:00:18.050 --> 01:00:19.800
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just had a weird feeling rod.</v>

1348
01:00:19.950 --> 01:00:21.960
<v Speaker 3>Oh fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy though.</v>

1349
01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:23.960
<v Speaker 3>If it's always the things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1350
01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:25.530
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1351
01:00:25.550 --> 01:00:27.440
<v Speaker 3>Then you could also tell when people are</v>
<v Speaker 3>creepy too,</v>

1352
01:00:27.441 --> 01:00:29.690
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can tell when someone's a creep.</v>

1353
01:00:30.350 --> 01:00:33.610
<v Speaker 3>Just like there's something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the vibe that you'll pick up weird vibe.</v>

1354
01:00:33.611 --> 01:00:35.210
<v Speaker 3>Like what is that like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's that?</v>

1355
01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:37.400
<v Speaker 3>I really do think that there's something</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1356
01:00:37.490 --> 01:00:38.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>verbal communication,</v>

1357
01:00:38.911 --> 01:00:41.780
<v Speaker 3>when he's a vet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's mold way in which we communicate.</v>

1358
01:00:41.781 --> 01:00:43.470
<v Speaker 3>There's so much more clear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's cause you know,</v>

1359
01:00:43.490 --> 01:00:46.760
<v Speaker 3>there are times when you walk into a </v>
<v Speaker 3>room and you will that I didn't know who</v>

1360
01:00:46.761 --> 01:00:48.220
<v Speaker 3>you are going to like and what you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>

1361
01:00:48.460 --> 01:00:53.460
<v Speaker 3>You and the ones that you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you need to spend the next whatever</v>

1362
01:00:53.991 --> 01:00:56.960
<v Speaker 3>long it takes you to find the reason why</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't click that you will.</v>

1363
01:00:57.020 --> 01:00:59.810
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's that something there is going on</v>

1364
01:00:59.811 --> 01:01:00.644
<v Speaker 3>and the smell and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think most people could ask </v>

1365
01:01:03.051 --> 01:01:04.520
<v Speaker 3>their perception.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they are like,</v>

1366
01:01:04.521 --> 01:01:04.971
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1367
01:01:04.971 --> 01:01:05.804
<v Speaker 3>I need to find out the rationale,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reason why would I have these </v>

1368
01:01:08.661 --> 01:01:10.640
<v Speaker 3>preconceptions I need.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To me,</v>

1369
01:01:10.641 --> 01:01:12.470
<v Speaker 3>it's like if you feel it just partly </v>
<v Speaker 3>good,</v>

1370
01:01:12.471 --> 01:01:13.340
<v Speaker 3>the reason for it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1371
01:01:13.370 --> 01:01:14.203
<v Speaker 3>if you have a strong feeling about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how would that I state rather than not </v>

1372
01:01:18.140 --> 01:01:19.910
<v Speaker 3>fuck yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1373
01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:22.460
<v Speaker 3>Trusted rather than not as a good way </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

1374
01:01:22.461 --> 01:01:24.890
<v Speaker 3>don't trust it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's definitely a witch.</v>

1375
01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:25.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1376
01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:27.530
<v Speaker 3>not that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do not burn.</v>

1377
01:01:27.531 --> 01:01:29.960
<v Speaker 3>Knew it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do not burn your people at the stake.</v>

1378
01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:32.170
<v Speaker 3>That's a bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1379
01:01:33.470 --> 01:01:34.730
<v Speaker 3>that was a weird time too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1380
01:01:34.910 --> 01:01:37.450
<v Speaker 3>It's just amazing to me that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1381
01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:38.593
<v Speaker 3>the United States is such a recent sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of experiment in self government and </v>

1382
01:01:43.761 --> 01:01:46.280
<v Speaker 3>that no one has done anything like that </v>
<v Speaker 3>since then.</v>

1383
01:01:46.670 --> 01:01:47.503
<v Speaker 3>That's what's kind of really amazing to </v>
<v Speaker 3>me when to stop and think about all the </v>

1384
01:01:50.631 --> 01:01:55.310
<v Speaker 3>wacky shit that's taking place in </v>
<v Speaker 3>America over the last 300 plus years and</v>

1385
01:01:55.311 --> 01:01:57.620
<v Speaker 3>then no one else has done that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one else has said,</v>

1386
01:01:57.750 --> 01:01:58.583
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we found the spot in Australia and the </v>

1387
01:02:00.411 --> 01:02:04.250
<v Speaker 3>Australian government is allowed us to </v>
<v Speaker 3>carve off a big chunk and that's,</v>

1388
01:02:04.410 --> 01:02:05.510
<v Speaker 3>let's call it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1389
01:02:05.750 --> 01:02:08.420
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then Daniella land,</v>

1390
01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:10.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm all for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That I swear I'll be a good leader.</v>

1391
01:02:10.970 --> 01:02:11.803
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1392
01:02:11.820 --> 01:02:13.700
<v Speaker 3>it's going well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your wives maybe.</v>

1393
01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:15.573
<v Speaker 3>It seems like what it's also amazing is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the United States has managed to </v>

1394
01:02:19.351 --> 01:02:20.184
<v Speaker 3>become the number one superpower in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world as a a group of all crazy </v>

1395
01:02:24.901 --> 01:02:25.710
<v Speaker 3>immigrants.</v>

1396
01:02:25.710 --> 01:02:27.510
<v Speaker 3>That all moved into one spot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

1397
01:02:28.110 --> 01:02:28.943
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Know the story of the United States is </v>

1398
01:02:30.211 --> 01:02:31.044
<v Speaker 3>fascinating because he had you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and probably is never going to happen </v>

1399
01:02:33.871 --> 01:02:36.390
<v Speaker 3>again because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was the proud owner of a word I did</v>

1400
01:02:36.391 --> 01:02:37.410
<v Speaker 3>not know about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1401
01:02:37.411 --> 01:02:38.640
<v Speaker 3>there's this other column,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1402
01:02:38.641 --> 01:02:39.990
<v Speaker 3>you'll find out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a new,</v>

1403
01:02:39.991 --> 01:02:42.150
<v Speaker 3>it's exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's 76 now.</v>

1404
01:02:42.151 --> 01:02:45.540
<v Speaker 3>You'll know what's out there and then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless you go for space exploration,</v>

1405
01:02:45.541 --> 01:02:48.570
<v Speaker 3>nothing like these will happen in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>history of planet earth.</v>

1406
01:02:48.650 --> 01:02:51.300
<v Speaker 3>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only way it can happen is a reset.</v>

1407
01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:52.193
<v Speaker 3>A civilization reset.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there'd have to be like a bunch of </v>

1408
01:02:54.181 --> 01:02:56.340
<v Speaker 3>people die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like most people die.</v>

1409
01:02:56.460 --> 01:02:57.293
<v Speaker 3>I Paul called libs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most people lose the knowledge of what </v>

1410
01:02:58.981 --> 01:03:00.360
<v Speaker 3>was going on before then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1411
01:03:00.361 --> 01:03:02.940
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'll can have a post Grad Manco kind of</v>

1412
01:03:02.941 --> 01:03:04.320
<v Speaker 3>story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1413
01:03:04.470 --> 01:03:05.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Post Graham Hancock,</v>

1414
01:03:05.731 --> 01:03:07.590
<v Speaker 3>that's entirely possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1415
01:03:07.890 --> 01:03:08.910
<v Speaker 3>that's entirely possible.</v>

1416
01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:11.790
<v Speaker 3>Although I did read something very </v>
<v Speaker 3>recently that they think,</v>

1417
01:03:11.791 --> 01:03:13.730
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1418
01:03:13.770 --> 01:03:14.603
<v Speaker 3>what was the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a supervolcano that killed most people </v>

1419
01:03:19.381 --> 01:03:20.214
<v Speaker 3>on the planet 70,000 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They found one pocket of humans that </v>

1420
01:03:23.461 --> 01:03:24.294
<v Speaker 3>actually survived and thrived in Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they think that the entire </v>

1421
01:03:28.831 --> 01:03:32.490
<v Speaker 3>population of a human beings at that </v>
<v Speaker 3>point in time,</v>

1422
01:03:32.491 --> 01:03:33.324
<v Speaker 3>70,000 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the entire population in the world was </v>

1423
01:03:36.211 --> 01:03:39.080
<v Speaker 3>only around a hundred thousand people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1424
01:03:39.150 --> 01:03:42.960
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then it dropped down to 10,000 wow.</v>

1425
01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:45.630
<v Speaker 3>10,000 people because of the Super </v>
<v Speaker 3>Volcano.</v>

1426
01:03:45.990 --> 01:03:50.670
<v Speaker 3>So the super volcano blew.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wiped out most life.</v>

1427
01:03:51.170 --> 01:03:55.560
<v Speaker 3>It wiped out most people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It plunged the earth into some sort of a</v>

1428
01:03:55.561 --> 01:03:58.140
<v Speaker 3>nuclear winter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forgot where it was.</v>

1429
01:03:58.290 --> 01:04:00.750
<v Speaker 3>I want to say it was Bali or Indonesia </v>
<v Speaker 3>Toba.</v>

1430
01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:02.040
<v Speaker 3>Where was that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Indonesia.</v>

1431
01:04:02.041 --> 01:04:02.874
<v Speaker 3>Indonesia Sumatra killed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Literally 90% of the people and 10,000 </v>

1432
01:04:09.601 --> 01:04:10.434
<v Speaker 3>were left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So 70,000 years ago we were down at </v>

1433
01:04:12.301 --> 01:04:15.990
<v Speaker 3>10,000 humans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which makes all the sinks about racism.</v>

1434
01:04:16.010 --> 01:04:17.820
<v Speaker 3>So sealy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause that's a,</v>

1435
01:04:17.821 --> 01:04:18.654
<v Speaker 3>that's a good show for Kevin Hart that </v>
<v Speaker 3>even that's a light crowd for Kevin </v>

1436
01:04:22.060 --> 01:04:25.200
<v Speaker 3>Hart's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly how she got 10,000 people.</v>

1437
01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:26.373
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a fucking blink one 82 </v>

1438
01:04:27.721 --> 01:04:30.810
<v Speaker 3>concert.</v>
<v Speaker 3>10,000 people,</v>

1439
01:04:30.820 --> 01:04:31.653
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's nothing that you stop and think </v>

1440
01:04:33.601 --> 01:04:35.130
<v Speaker 3>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's insane.</v>

1441
01:04:35.310 --> 01:04:38.140
<v Speaker 3>I've done 10,000 people in the night </v>
<v Speaker 3>before in uh,</v>

1442
01:04:38.190 --> 01:04:39.540
<v Speaker 3>Denver.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did two shows.</v>

1443
01:04:39.541 --> 01:04:42.210
<v Speaker 3>There are 5,000 each.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's 10,000 people.</v>

1444
01:04:42.211 --> 01:04:47.211
<v Speaker 3>That's the fucking entire population of </v>
<v Speaker 3>earth and that now became 7 billion.</v>

1445
01:04:48.810 --> 01:04:51.120
<v Speaker 3>70,000 years later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's nuts.</v>

1446
01:04:51.150 --> 01:04:53.790
<v Speaker 3>We're so weird where it's such a weird </v>
<v Speaker 3>animal.</v>

1447
01:04:53.910 --> 01:04:56.040
<v Speaker 3>Like if you could study us without being</v>
<v Speaker 3>us,</v>

1448
01:04:56.370 --> 01:04:57.203
<v Speaker 3>like if somehow I know that you could </v>
<v Speaker 3>remove all of your cultural conceptions </v>

1449
01:05:01.171 --> 01:05:02.004
<v Speaker 3>and all the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the things that you've just sort of </v>

1450
01:05:03.990 --> 01:05:04.823
<v Speaker 3>accepted and you establish as fact as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>human and just look at it completely </v>

1451
01:05:09.721 --> 01:05:10.800
<v Speaker 3>objective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd be like,</v>

1452
01:05:10.801 --> 01:05:11.634
<v Speaker 3>what are nutty animal?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This thing is what the fuck are we </v>

1453
01:05:15.331 --> 01:05:16.164
<v Speaker 3>doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1454
01:05:16.530 --> 01:05:17.470
<v Speaker 3>That's why</v>

1455
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:20.470
<v Speaker 1>it never gets old to study the human </v>
<v Speaker 1>psyche.</v>

1456
01:05:20.471 --> 01:05:21.304
<v Speaker 1>Like what makes people choose this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that's the beauty of human </v>

1457
01:05:24.131 --> 01:05:25.450
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have choices that,</v>

1458
01:05:25.451 --> 01:05:26.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

1459
01:05:27.550 --> 01:05:28.383
<v Speaker 1>at Wolf is a wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are only so many things you can </v>

1460
01:05:29.891 --> 01:05:31.750
<v Speaker 1>choose as a wall for your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1461
01:05:31.751 --> 01:05:32.584
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could have a world that adopts one </v>

1462
01:05:33.521 --> 01:05:34.630
<v Speaker 1>strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one another,</v>

1463
01:05:34.660 --> 01:05:36.670
<v Speaker 1>but the range of choices is pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>limited.</v>

1464
01:05:36.671 --> 01:05:39.550
<v Speaker 1>As humans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have this insane range of choices and</v>

1465
01:05:39.551 --> 01:05:40.384
<v Speaker 1>he's fascinated to see what is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make some people going one direction in </v>

1466
01:05:43.931 --> 01:05:47.530
<v Speaker 1>a completely different one and it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is fun.</v>

1467
01:05:47.531 --> 01:05:50.200
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what's fascinating to me about human</v>

1468
01:05:50.201 --> 01:05:54.700
<v Speaker 1>beings of today is I've never seen a </v>
<v Speaker 1>time where people were more interesting,</v>

1469
01:05:54.910 --> 01:05:59.910
<v Speaker 1>more interested rather in other people </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing what they want them to do,</v>

1470
01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:04.540
<v Speaker 1>like other people thinking the way they </v>
<v Speaker 1>want them to think,</v>

1471
01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:07.240
<v Speaker 1>other people behaving the way they want </v>
<v Speaker 1>the people want.</v>

1472
01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:08.073
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me are more concerned with </v>
<v Speaker 1>controlling people's expression and </v>

1473
01:06:12.581 --> 01:06:17.290
<v Speaker 1>thinking today than ever before and even</v>
<v Speaker 1>more so on the left.</v>

1474
01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:18.513
<v Speaker 1>It seems like I'm seeing this </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting trend today where people </v>

1475
01:06:23.141 --> 01:06:23.974
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like we don't like where </v>

1476
01:06:25.091 --> 01:06:27.670
<v Speaker 1>things are headed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't like what's happening.</v>

1477
01:06:27.671 --> 01:06:28.504
<v Speaker 1>We don't like who the president is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people are are being real adamant </v>

1478
01:06:31.750 --> 01:06:36.010
<v Speaker 1>about enforcing certain types of </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior and that in turn,</v>

1479
01:06:36.190 --> 01:06:37.023
<v Speaker 1>just like we're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>suppressing people from drinking </v>

1480
01:06:38.411 --> 01:06:40.810
<v Speaker 1>alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then in turn makes people rebel.</v>

1481
01:06:40.870 --> 01:06:45.370
<v Speaker 1>Of course that's like there's more </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are leaning right today than</v>

1482
01:06:45.371 --> 01:06:50.350
<v Speaker 1>ever before and I attribute it entirely </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the people on the left piano to thing</v>

1483
01:06:50.351 --> 01:06:54.010
<v Speaker 1>that's funny about it is that most human</v>
<v Speaker 1>beings,</v>

1484
01:06:54.070 --> 01:06:55.570
<v Speaker 1>even if you've just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll cut the United States,</v>

1485
01:06:55.571 --> 01:06:58.750
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people are not the extreme right or</v>

1486
01:06:58.780 --> 01:07:01.420
<v Speaker 1>extreme left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No Fair whelming majority or not,</v>

1487
01:07:01.470 --> 01:07:02.080
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1488
01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:02.913
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of the staff is also a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit media created in the sense </v>

1489
01:07:05.981 --> 01:07:06.814
<v Speaker 1>that he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's find a moss batshit crazy person </v>

1490
01:07:09.041 --> 01:07:11.860
<v Speaker 1>on that side to put the spotlight on </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

1491
01:07:12.130 --> 01:07:14.680
<v Speaker 1>which make everybody go like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

1492
01:07:14.710 --> 01:07:17.830
<v Speaker 1>Why are those crazy people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's how,</v>

1493
01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:19.900
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of like if you were to peek,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1494
01:07:19.901 --> 01:07:24.460
<v Speaker 1>the Westboro Baptist Church and make it </v>
<v Speaker 1>be a representative of Christianity.</v>

1495
01:07:24.461 --> 01:07:26.360
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're nobody.</v>

1496
01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:28.390
<v Speaker 1>If you keeps putting the spotlight </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

1497
01:07:28.391 --> 01:07:30.100
<v Speaker 1>you'll create this perception with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Korea,</v>

1498
01:07:30.101 --> 01:07:30.934
<v Speaker 1>tobacco collage and it becomes this </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing where like that sounded funny </v>

1499
01:07:33.581 --> 01:07:38.410
<v Speaker 1>thing that I was in the ltcm because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>really don't like political correctness.</v>

1500
01:07:38.411 --> 01:07:40.900
<v Speaker 1>I really don't like academia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really don't.</v>

1501
01:07:40.930 --> 01:07:41.763
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are 10,000 of these things where </v>

1502
01:07:42.701 --> 01:07:43.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1503
01:07:43.300 --> 01:07:44.133
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm completely on board with not liking </v>

1504
01:07:46.541 --> 01:07:49.630
<v Speaker 1>some of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then there's another side where,</v>

1505
01:07:49.631 --> 01:07:50.464
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have been teaching a university since </v>

1506
01:07:52.421 --> 01:07:53.254
<v Speaker 1>2001 I don't think I've seen once a case</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the kind of political correctness </v>

1507
01:07:58.211 --> 01:08:00.750
<v Speaker 1>that I see in articles in media now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lance,</v>

1508
01:08:00.830 --> 01:08:02.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I was doing the math.</v>

1509
01:08:02.561 --> 01:08:03.394
<v Speaker 1>I had probably maybe 11,000 students in </v>
<v Speaker 1>my classes over the course of these </v>

1510
01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:07.593
<v Speaker 1>years and I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't heard one person ever the fan </v>

1511
01:08:11.050 --> 01:08:15.380
<v Speaker 1>hardcore communism or make an argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even among my colleagues,</v>

1512
01:08:15.381 --> 01:08:16.040
<v Speaker 1>which I have</v>

1513
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:20.450
<v Speaker 3>issues for other reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's never been one of the things.</v>

1514
01:08:20.451 --> 01:08:22.130
<v Speaker 3>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I keep hearing about it.</v>

1515
01:08:22.131 --> 01:08:25.370
<v Speaker 3>I read it on papers by why is that when </v>
<v Speaker 3>I spend,</v>

1516
01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:27.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how I make my living.</v>

1517
01:08:27.291 --> 01:08:30.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm on college campuses all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hardly ever see it.</v>

1518
01:08:31.270 --> 01:08:33.080
<v Speaker 3>And so I'm thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that he's not through.</v>

1519
01:08:33.081 --> 01:08:33.914
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1520
01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.410
<v Speaker 3>of course the stories are true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no argument.</v>

1521
01:08:36.830 --> 01:08:40.640
<v Speaker 3>But what I'm wondering is how much do </v>
<v Speaker 3>they get blown out of proportion because</v>

1522
01:08:40.641 --> 01:08:44.120
<v Speaker 3>you get clicks because it makes for an </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting narrative which dance.</v>

1523
01:08:44.121 --> 01:08:47.660
<v Speaker 3>Some people also leave off kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>narrative and I'm like,</v>

1524
01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:49.153
<v Speaker 3>how much is it something where you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>putting the spotlight on a rare </v>

1525
01:08:52.531 --> 01:08:55.640
<v Speaker 3>exception and make it the norm versus </v>
<v Speaker 3>how much?</v>

1526
01:08:55.641 --> 01:08:58.940
<v Speaker 3>It's a real thing because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would expect,</v>

1527
01:08:58.941 --> 01:08:59.774
<v Speaker 3>I mean I teach in south around </v>
<v Speaker 3>California and some of the ones who </v>

1528
01:09:01.241 --> 01:09:01.641
<v Speaker 3>leave them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1529
01:09:01.641 --> 01:09:04.130
<v Speaker 3>Santa Monica is one of the most liberal </v>
<v Speaker 3>places around.</v>

1530
01:09:04.610 --> 01:09:07.220
<v Speaker 3>If d seeing was as dominant as </v>
<v Speaker 3>advertised,</v>

1531
01:09:07.250 --> 01:09:09.500
<v Speaker 3>I should be running into it all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

1532
01:09:09.501 --> 01:09:11.810
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I don't like that stuff.</v>

1533
01:09:11.811 --> 01:09:12.890
<v Speaker 3>So I would be sensitive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1534
01:09:12.891 --> 01:09:15.440
<v Speaker 3>I would be paying attention and yet I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't see it.</v>

1535
01:09:15.530 --> 01:09:16.520
<v Speaker 3>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hmm,</v>

1536
01:09:16.730 --> 01:09:18.560
<v Speaker 3>what's going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>

1537
01:09:18.770 --> 01:09:19.603
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the instances are more frequent </v>

1538
01:09:21.471 --> 01:09:22.304
<v Speaker 3>than ever before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I also think if you put it into </v>

1539
01:09:24.381 --> 01:09:25.214
<v Speaker 3>perspective and think about how many </v>
<v Speaker 3>universities there are across the </v>

1540
01:09:28.041 --> 01:09:28.874
<v Speaker 3>country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there are hundreds and hundreds </v>

1541
01:09:31.311 --> 01:09:32.144
<v Speaker 3>of universities and if you have one </v>
<v Speaker 3>incident that breaks out one month in </v>

1542
01:09:38.841 --> 01:09:39.674
<v Speaker 3>one place exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was about one conservative </v>

1543
01:09:42.710 --> 01:09:43.543
<v Speaker 3>speaker that's going to give a lecture </v>
<v Speaker 3>and everybody freaks out and goes crazy </v>

1544
01:09:46.161 --> 01:09:50.000
<v Speaker 3>and all the people with green hair </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking bang on the windows.</v>

1545
01:09:50.630 --> 01:09:51.463
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it becomes something that people were </v>

1546
01:09:53.091 --> 01:09:56.150
<v Speaker 3>worried about spreading.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I think that's one of the,</v>

1547
01:09:56.151 --> 01:09:58.940
<v Speaker 3>one of the reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause like I'm sure you're familiar with</v>

1548
01:09:58.941 --> 01:10:01.610
<v Speaker 3>the story from Evergreen University,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Evergreen state.</v>

1549
01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:04.340
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was a fascinating story.</v>

1550
01:10:04.610 --> 01:10:07.730
<v Speaker 3>And for people who are interested in it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Google,</v>

1551
01:10:07.750 --> 01:10:10.340
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bret Weinstein and um,</v>

1552
01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:14.450
<v Speaker 3>evergreen state college and you could </v>
<v Speaker 3>listen to him on my podcast.</v>

1553
01:10:14.451 --> 01:10:17.060
<v Speaker 3>I had him on right after it all went </v>
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

1554
01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:18.553
<v Speaker 3>What had happened was there's a thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>called the day of absence that had </v>

1555
01:10:20.121 --> 01:10:20.954
<v Speaker 3>traditionally been people of color would</v>
<v Speaker 3>stay home just so that people would </v>

1556
01:10:24.141 --> 01:10:25.700
<v Speaker 3>recognize that like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1557
01:10:25.701 --> 01:10:26.534
<v Speaker 3>when they're not there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we missed them and we missed their </v>

1558
01:10:27.681 --> 01:10:28.514
<v Speaker 3>contributions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're an important part of our </v>

1559
01:10:29.631 --> 01:10:30.464
<v Speaker 3>community.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a little silly to stay </v>

1560
01:10:31.791 --> 01:10:32.624
<v Speaker 3>home and do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think it's not a bad thing for </v>

1561
01:10:36.411 --> 01:10:39.980
<v Speaker 3>people to recognize that everybody plays</v>
<v Speaker 3>a part.</v>

1562
01:10:39.981 --> 01:10:40.814
<v Speaker 3>And if these people feel marginalized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>give them a little extra juice and </v>

1563
01:10:42.881 --> 01:10:43.714
<v Speaker 3>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the real hardcore social justice </v>

1564
01:10:46.101 --> 01:10:50.180
<v Speaker 3>warriors decided that's not enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Instead what we want is all white people</v>

1565
01:10:50.181 --> 01:10:52.530
<v Speaker 3>to stay home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like you can't do that.</v>

1566
01:10:52.531 --> 01:10:53.364
<v Speaker 3>And of course is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now you're telling people to stay home </v>

1567
01:10:55.220 --> 01:10:59.780
<v Speaker 3>versus allowing people to stay home in </v>
<v Speaker 3>which a case you missed them.</v>

1568
01:11:00.110 --> 01:11:00.943
<v Speaker 3>This is the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're telling these white people to </v>

1569
01:11:02.331 --> 01:11:03.560
<v Speaker 3>fuck off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Brett,</v>

1570
01:11:03.561 --> 01:11:06.650
<v Speaker 3>who is like a fiercely progressive </v>
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>

1571
01:11:06.890 --> 01:11:09.170
<v Speaker 3>was telling people like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are making a mistake here.</v>

1572
01:11:09.171 --> 01:11:11.420
<v Speaker 3>You're getting out of line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not the way to do it.</v>

1573
01:11:11.460 --> 01:11:12.293
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they went crazy and fucking </v>

1574
01:11:13.471 --> 01:11:13.980
<v Speaker 3>looking for him</v>

1575
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:15.480
<v Speaker 1>with baseball bats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they,</v>

1576
01:11:15.690 --> 01:11:16.061
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1577
01:11:16.061 --> 01:11:19.200
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they literally kidnapped classes.</v>

1578
01:11:19.350 --> 01:11:22.080
<v Speaker 1>They held a teacher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they held the principal,</v>

1579
01:11:22.270 --> 01:11:23.103
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the president of the school in this </v>

1580
01:11:24.811 --> 01:11:26.880
<v Speaker 1>room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even when he,</v>

1581
01:11:26.881 --> 01:11:27.714
<v Speaker 1>they went to the bathroom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they escorted him to the restroom and </v>

1582
01:11:29.341 --> 01:11:31.650
<v Speaker 1>then brought him back to the room and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't let people leave.</v>

1583
01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:34.530
<v Speaker 1>The stories are amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not mean fed that stuff.</v>

1584
01:11:34.531 --> 01:11:36.770
<v Speaker 1>He's complete batshit crazy line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1585
01:11:36.771 --> 01:11:38.940
<v Speaker 1>That shit crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We completely agree on that.</v>

1586
01:11:38.941 --> 01:11:42.210
<v Speaker 1>It's like that is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That has no place anywhere.</v>

1587
01:11:42.420 --> 01:11:43.253
<v Speaker 1>That's bullshit that you don't do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stuff like that is just same thing as </v>

1588
01:11:46.231 --> 01:11:47.064
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know to Jordan Peterson thing in </v>

1589
01:11:48.001 --> 01:11:49.920
<v Speaker 1>Toronto,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that policy wall,</v>

1590
01:11:49.921 --> 01:11:52.290
<v Speaker 1>just stupid policy and he was right in </v>
<v Speaker 1>our going against it.</v>

1591
01:11:52.291 --> 01:11:54.520
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not arguing that those are that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they are wrong.</v>

1592
01:11:54.530 --> 01:11:56.120
<v Speaker 1>Now I know you're not know you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1593
01:11:56.210 --> 01:11:57.043
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My issue is from there to wire green </v>

1594
01:11:59.551 --> 01:12:00.384
<v Speaker 1>that dcs the super prevalent thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like from one story or one study </v>

1595
01:12:05.191 --> 01:12:06.024
<v Speaker 1>there to say instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know there's a communist conspiracy </v>

1596
01:12:08.011 --> 01:12:09.240
<v Speaker 1>to brainwash us all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1597
01:12:09.241 --> 01:12:10.074
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we are starting from a completely </v>

1598
01:12:12.031 --> 01:12:15.720
<v Speaker 1>understandable prime and taking it like </v>
<v Speaker 1>25 steps too far.</v>

1599
01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:16.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

1600
01:12:16.980 --> 01:12:17.813
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think that what's happening is </v>

1601
01:12:19.801 --> 01:12:20.634
<v Speaker 1>more of these unusual situations are </v>
<v Speaker 1>occurring and so people were terrified </v>

1602
01:12:25.711 --> 01:12:30.711
<v Speaker 1>of this spreading like wildfire across </v>
<v Speaker 1>the country because kids are very easily</v>

1603
01:12:30.841 --> 01:12:32.040
<v Speaker 1>influenced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1604
01:12:32.070 --> 01:12:34.440
<v Speaker 1>and there are also idealistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1605
01:12:34.441 --> 01:12:35.580
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wanna change the world.</v>

1606
01:12:35.700 --> 01:12:39.210
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they grew up with a father was an </v>
<v Speaker 1>asshole and a racist and like fuck this,</v>

1607
01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:42.100
<v Speaker 1>no racism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no fascism and they're calling everybody</v>

1608
01:12:42.101 --> 01:12:44.130
<v Speaker 1>that Nazi and running down the street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>

1609
01:12:44.570 --> 01:12:47.610
<v Speaker 1>you have it as a question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not as a something I'm sure of.</v>

1610
01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:50.770
<v Speaker 1>But what I want that is our motto of </v>
<v Speaker 1>daisies,</v>

1611
01:12:50.860 --> 01:12:51.693
<v Speaker 1>media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>media fueled and now matches the real </v>

1612
01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:57.300
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>He yelled for sure.</v>

1613
01:12:57.330 --> 01:12:59.760
<v Speaker 1>My question is how much is some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1614
01:12:59.761 --> 01:13:00.594
<v Speaker 1>there's most certainly media influences </v>
<v Speaker 1>people in it influences people in a </v>

1615
01:13:06.421 --> 01:13:07.254
<v Speaker 1>bunch of different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It shows that you can get attention for </v>

1616
01:13:08.821 --> 01:13:09.654
<v Speaker 1>doing certain things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It shows that other people were in </v>

1617
01:13:11.191 --> 01:13:12.024
<v Speaker 1>support of maybe what you thought were </v>
<v Speaker 1>your radical ideas and then you find </v>

1618
01:13:14.911 --> 01:13:15.744
<v Speaker 1>other radical people as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean that's also the argument for </v>

1619
01:13:18.601 --> 01:13:20.610
<v Speaker 1>not publishing the name of school </v>
<v Speaker 1>shooters.</v>

1620
01:13:20.970 --> 01:13:23.430
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because a lot of these people think</v>

1621
01:13:23.431 --> 01:13:26.220
<v Speaker 1>that this is media fueled by people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are seeking attention.</v>

1622
01:13:26.221 --> 01:13:27.054
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're probably right and </v>

1623
01:13:28.261 --> 01:13:29.094
<v Speaker 1>certain in a certain respect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also just a part of who we are </v>

1624
01:13:33.211 --> 01:13:38.211
<v Speaker 1>and I think it makes us really consider </v>
<v Speaker 1>and taking the responsibility,</v>

1625
01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:44.000
<v Speaker 1>what is significant about broadcasting </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas and how much influence these ideas</v>

1626
01:13:45.391 --> 01:13:48.090
<v Speaker 1>have on people who absorb them.</v>

1627
01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:49.770
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take them in for sure.</v>

1628
01:13:49.771 --> 01:13:53.070
<v Speaker 1>I think my issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's some of the seeing is that often it</v>

1629
01:13:53.071 --> 01:13:53.904
<v Speaker 1>becomes a power thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It become Micah when your guys do that </v>

1630
01:13:56.851 --> 01:13:58.680
<v Speaker 1>and they showed those totalitarian </v>
<v Speaker 1>sinks,</v>

1631
01:13:58.681 --> 01:14:01.350
<v Speaker 1>then boo bath authoritarians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When my guys,</v>

1632
01:14:01.351 --> 01:14:02.184
<v Speaker 1>the way turn the other way in Bhutan is </v>
<v Speaker 1>not true to me in fact is not a one </v>

1633
01:14:06.331 --> 01:14:07.164
<v Speaker 1>particular ideology or neither.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It kind of goes back to what you were </v>

1634
01:14:09.241 --> 01:14:12.850
<v Speaker 1>saying about human nature in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>totalitarianism.</v>

1635
01:14:13.090 --> 01:14:13.923
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this idea that you want to control what </v>

1636
01:14:15.521 --> 01:14:18.940
<v Speaker 1>people think they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Choices is horrible,</v>

1637
01:14:18.970 --> 01:14:21.700
<v Speaker 1>but regardless of who's doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in that case,</v>

1638
01:14:21.701 --> 01:14:22.534
<v Speaker 1>nobody has a monopoly on this because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have seen a hardcore religious </v>

1639
01:14:25.631 --> 01:14:28.740
<v Speaker 1>fundamentalists push totalitarianism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have seen Harlem,</v>

1640
01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:32.160
<v Speaker 1>you know eight day study biology like </v>
<v Speaker 1>communism pushing totalitarian.</v>

1641
01:14:32.170 --> 01:14:33.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely right.</v>

1642
01:14:33.700 --> 01:14:37.090
<v Speaker 1>You see people on the political left </v>
<v Speaker 1>report on the political right.</v>

1643
01:14:37.750 --> 01:14:39.400
<v Speaker 1>Everybody has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a virus.</v>

1644
01:14:39.430 --> 01:14:40.263
<v Speaker 1>You know it's a viral self.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mind that when he took over there's </v>

1645
01:14:42.191 --> 01:14:43.024
<v Speaker 1>this desire squall shola their choices </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I find it equally horrible that </v>

1646
01:14:47.901 --> 01:14:48.734
<v Speaker 1>regardless of who's doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know I'm a little suspicious of </v>

1647
01:14:51.541 --> 01:14:52.374
<v Speaker 1>wearing the narrative becomes Luca dose </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys doing it and you're only picking </v>

1648
01:14:55.931 --> 01:14:56.764
<v Speaker 1>one side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like there are some guys where I </v>

1649
01:14:58.151 --> 01:15:01.180
<v Speaker 1>see even in the desperately try to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1650
01:15:01.181 --> 01:15:01.931
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fair.</v>

1651
01:15:01.931 --> 01:15:02.890
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I pick on my,</v>

1652
01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:04.810
<v Speaker 1>I was listening to somebody doing this </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1653
01:15:04.811 --> 01:15:07.390
<v Speaker 1>I think it was more rightwing Korea </v>
<v Speaker 1>entered and he was saying,</v>

1654
01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:09.340
<v Speaker 1>Oh this time we are wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

1655
01:15:09.370 --> 01:15:11.110
<v Speaker 1>oh look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of a self critique.</v>

1656
01:15:11.170 --> 01:15:12.400
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me listen.</v>

1657
01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:13.833
<v Speaker 1>We are wrong because we are just like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the left and you should hear what the </v>

1658
01:15:16.601 --> 01:15:17.434
<v Speaker 1>left at the and then for the next half </v>
<v Speaker 1>hour he goes on about the left and I'm </v>

1659
01:15:19.370 --> 01:15:20.820
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not seth Godin.</v>

1660
01:15:20.830 --> 01:15:24.300
<v Speaker 1>He sees a motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're stele parties on shale know.</v>

1661
01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:25.353
<v Speaker 1>That's like not been honest to me and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I think what bugs me is when it's </v>

1662
01:15:30.341 --> 01:15:33.640
<v Speaker 1>an ideological battle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you want to score points as opposed</v>

1663
01:15:33.641 --> 01:15:34.361
<v Speaker 1>to saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1664
01:15:34.361 --> 01:15:38.590
<v Speaker 1>there are certain scenes that are fucked</v>
<v Speaker 1>up that are evil totalitarianism,</v>

1665
01:15:38.591 --> 01:15:41.620
<v Speaker 1>regardless of we charge a is attached to</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is bad.</v>

1666
01:15:42.340 --> 01:15:44.080
<v Speaker 1>How about we agree on that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1667
01:15:44.110 --> 01:15:44.943
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of where sometime I feel a </v>

1668
01:15:49.601 --> 01:15:50.434
<v Speaker 1>little sketch in the way the narrative </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets pushed that it become semi tribe </v>

1669
01:15:53.710 --> 01:15:55.150
<v Speaker 1>versus your tribe thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1670
01:15:55.151 --> 01:15:55.984
<v Speaker 1>you would probably know better than most</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you've been teaching in </v>

1671
01:15:57.761 --> 01:15:58.594
<v Speaker 1>universities for so long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you would see that you're on the </v>

1672
01:16:00.551 --> 01:16:01.384
<v Speaker 1>battlefield.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of what it is is a lot of </v>

1673
01:16:03.701 --> 01:16:04.534
<v Speaker 1>what you were talking about before about</v>
<v Speaker 1>people doing horrific things is that </v>

1674
01:16:08.021 --> 01:16:08.854
<v Speaker 1>they're cowards and they just give in to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whims of those around them and the </v>

1675
01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:14.230
<v Speaker 1>mob mentality.</v>

1676
01:16:14.230 --> 01:16:15.063
<v Speaker 1>And I think that happens with the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>wing ideology that you see expressed in </v>

1677
01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:20.030
<v Speaker 1>horrific ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1678
01:16:20.350 --> 01:16:21.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's uh,</v>

1679
01:16:22.750 --> 01:16:24.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean fill in the blank.</v>

1680
01:16:24.821 --> 01:16:25.654
<v Speaker 1>It could be Charlottesville shall be any</v>
<v Speaker 1>of these horrific things that have </v>

1681
01:16:28.451 --> 01:16:29.284
<v Speaker 1>happened where right wing people got </v>
<v Speaker 1>together and protested versus what </v>

1682
01:16:33.191 --> 01:16:34.024
<v Speaker 1>happens with the left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a lot of it is just people </v>

1683
01:16:36.071 --> 01:16:39.820
<v Speaker 1>wanting to be a part of a group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People wanting to be a part of this,</v>

1684
01:16:39.821 --> 01:16:41.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing that gives them,</v>

1685
01:16:42.220 --> 01:16:43.053
<v Speaker 1>they have this feeling of being in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tribe and solidarity and then they go </v>

1686
01:16:48.341 --> 01:16:50.920
<v Speaker 1>along with whatever the ideology is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>tribes pushing.</v>

1687
01:16:51.310 --> 01:16:54.070
<v Speaker 1>And that to me is such a danger because </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

1688
01:16:54.730 --> 01:16:55.563
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sense of belonging is something </v>

1689
01:16:56.741 --> 01:16:59.410
<v Speaker 1>that all human beings crave to one </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree or another.</v>

1690
01:16:59.950 --> 01:17:00.783
<v Speaker 1>And sweets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same thing that make people join </v>

1691
01:17:02.201 --> 01:17:07.090
<v Speaker 1>cults is the same thing that make people</v>
<v Speaker 1>join some hardcore political position is</v>

1692
01:17:07.091 --> 01:17:09.440
<v Speaker 1>the same thing that make people join </v>
<v Speaker 1>biker guy.</v>

1693
01:17:09.470 --> 01:17:10.550
<v Speaker 1>It's the same mentality,</v>

1694
01:17:10.550 --> 01:17:11.750
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is we need to,</v>

1695
01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:15.530
<v Speaker 3>as our [inaudible] group with the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>clothes,</v>

1696
01:17:15.531 --> 01:17:16.364
<v Speaker 3>with the same idea as we stand for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it feels good to have other </v>

1697
01:17:19.191 --> 01:17:23.210
<v Speaker 3>people who embrace he was one of them or</v>
<v Speaker 3>three t well as a result,</v>

1698
01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:24.073
<v Speaker 3>but of course the price to pay is your </v>
<v Speaker 3>individuality because you have to kind </v>

1699
01:17:28.071 --> 01:17:28.904
<v Speaker 3>of sacrifice the complexity of who you </v>
<v Speaker 3>are in order to fit in neatly into this </v>

1700
01:17:32.391 --> 01:17:33.390
<v Speaker 3>box.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1701
01:17:33.410 --> 01:17:38.240
<v Speaker 3>and you kind of have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to shut out objectivity because</v>

1702
01:17:38.241 --> 01:17:40.040
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look at things objectively,</v>

1703
01:17:40.041 --> 01:17:40.581
<v Speaker 3>you're going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1704
01:17:40.581 --> 01:17:43.940
<v Speaker 3>we're fucked up too and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this doesn't make any sense on why these</v>

1705
01:17:43.941 --> 01:17:44.774
<v Speaker 3>aren't my enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just people that are on a bad </v>

1706
01:17:45.981 --> 01:17:46.814
<v Speaker 3>path like Saigon down on a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could have gone down that road too if </v>

1707
01:17:49.431 --> 01:17:54.290
<v Speaker 3>I lived over in that community and I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>found myself in this one spot that leans</v>

1708
01:17:54.291 --> 01:17:56.540
<v Speaker 3>left and so I'm leaning left to right.</v>

1709
01:17:56.930 --> 01:17:58.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well how does that stop though?</v>

1710
01:17:58.761 --> 01:18:00.710
<v Speaker 3>This is my question about all that kind </v>
<v Speaker 3>of stuff.</v>

1711
01:18:00.711 --> 01:18:01.544
<v Speaker 3>Like what could ever happen?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What could you foresee happening in </v>

1712
01:18:04.251 --> 01:18:08.090
<v Speaker 3>history where people could look past </v>
<v Speaker 3>that and sort of figure it out and go,</v>

1713
01:18:08.091 --> 01:18:08.924
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There has gotta be a better way to </v>

1714
01:18:11.301 --> 01:18:12.134
<v Speaker 3>behave and think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is probably one of our main </v>

1715
01:18:14.361 --> 01:18:15.194
<v Speaker 3>concerns because if you really look at </v>
<v Speaker 3>what if you ask people what's our main </v>

1716
01:18:18.441 --> 01:18:19.131
<v Speaker 3>concern?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1717
01:18:19.131 --> 01:18:19.911
<v Speaker 3>war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1718
01:18:19.911 --> 01:18:20.660
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1719
01:18:20.660 --> 01:18:21.620
<v Speaker 3>the economy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1720
01:18:21.621 --> 01:18:23.120
<v Speaker 3>that's big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you know,</v>

1721
01:18:23.180 --> 01:18:25.580
<v Speaker 3>and there's a host of other things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>bothered people,</v>

1722
01:18:25.581 --> 01:18:27.590
<v Speaker 3>crime and education and all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>different things.</v>

1723
01:18:27.591 --> 01:18:28.790
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

1724
01:18:29.210 --> 01:18:32.540
<v Speaker 3>what is causing all of this conflict?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is,</v>

1725
01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:33.890
<v Speaker 3>what is causing it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1726
01:18:33.891 --> 01:18:34.724
<v Speaker 3>a giant percentage of what we're talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about is some sort of a weird tribal </v>

1727
01:18:38.121 --> 01:18:41.870
<v Speaker 3>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or you get a get a group,</v>

1728
01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:45.530
<v Speaker 3>you become a part of that group and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what you identify with.</v>

1729
01:18:45.530 --> 01:18:46.363
<v Speaker 3>So that's what you reinforce and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>you get some sort of Brownie points for </v>

1730
01:18:50.151 --> 01:18:52.640
<v Speaker 3>reinforcing the ideologies of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>group.</v>

1731
01:18:52.641 --> 01:18:53.451
<v Speaker 3>And you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1732
01:18:53.451 --> 01:18:58.130
<v Speaker 3>if you're the most rabid person years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Steve Bannon of that group,</v>

1733
01:18:58.340 --> 01:18:59.173
<v Speaker 3>everybody rises up and gets behind you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This motherfuckers at the front of the </v>

1734
01:19:01.731 --> 01:19:04.040
<v Speaker 3>line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly supporting our values.</v>

1735
01:19:04.430 --> 01:19:05.263
<v Speaker 3>And then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you find these communities online where </v>

1736
01:19:07.281 --> 01:19:08.114
<v Speaker 3>people just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're constantly signaling to all </v>

1737
01:19:09.861 --> 01:19:10.694
<v Speaker 3>these other people in that group that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're supporting this ideology and </v>

1738
01:19:13.881 --> 01:19:14.714
<v Speaker 3>they get all these likes and me like I </v>
<v Speaker 3>feel like likes on twitter and on </v>

1739
01:19:19.041 --> 01:19:19.874
<v Speaker 3>instagram and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like that's shaping people's </v>

1740
01:19:22.281 --> 01:19:26.720
<v Speaker 3>opinions and behavior way more than </v>
<v Speaker 3>anyone has taken into consideration.</v>

1741
01:19:27.170 --> 01:19:29.110
<v Speaker 3>I mean even the fact that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the algorithms,</v>

1742
01:19:29.150 --> 01:19:32.500
<v Speaker 3>make sure that you only see the stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you are already click like.</v>

1743
01:19:32.610 --> 01:19:35.870
<v Speaker 3>So you start seeing the same threads </v>
<v Speaker 3>over and over the same topics.</v>

1744
01:19:36.230 --> 01:19:39.500
<v Speaker 3>You'd really is creating echo chambers </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's really not good.</v>

1745
01:19:39.590 --> 01:19:41.320
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1746
01:19:41.330 --> 01:19:44.450
<v Speaker 3>it's weird and it's weird what people </v>
<v Speaker 3>like and what people don't like.</v>

1747
01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:46.880
<v Speaker 3>A lot of of people like is just really </v>
<v Speaker 3>stupid.</v>

1748
01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:50.510
<v Speaker 3>I mean how many girls are getting fake </v>
<v Speaker 3>asses just for likes on instagram?</v>

1749
01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:52.100
<v Speaker 3>I know it's probably a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1750
01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:55.070
<v Speaker 3>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very,</v>

1751
01:19:55.071 --> 01:19:55.904
<v Speaker 3>very interesting time for human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like for you as a person who is </v>

1752
01:20:00.740 --> 01:20:01.573
<v Speaker 3>deeply knowledgeable about history and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you study history and you have this </v>

1753
01:20:04.191 --> 01:20:08.130
<v Speaker 3>history podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and when you look at today,</v>

1754
01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:09.113
<v Speaker 1>do you ever try to look at today in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective of someone in the future </v>

1755
01:20:11.581 --> 01:20:13.650
<v Speaker 1>trying to teach about today?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1756
01:20:13.651 --> 01:20:14.484
<v Speaker 1>and the thing is that as much as there </v>
<v Speaker 1>are obviously cycles in history and </v>

1757
01:20:17.581 --> 01:20:20.820
<v Speaker 1>there are patterns that are recognizable</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of that two days or so,</v>

1758
01:20:20.821 --> 01:20:24.780
<v Speaker 1>so damn unique because if you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just forgot everything got us.</v>

1759
01:20:24.781 --> 01:20:25.614
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the way just technology </v>
<v Speaker 1>has shaped does the last hundred and 50 </v>

1760
01:20:29.131 --> 01:20:32.710
<v Speaker 1>years are unlike the previous 200,000 </v>
<v Speaker 1>DRC.</v>

1761
01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:34.490
<v Speaker 1>You know the stuff that has happened in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the last time,</v>

1762
01:20:34.491 --> 01:20:39.450
<v Speaker 1>they're 50 years from electricity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the refrigerator or Internet radio,</v>

1763
01:20:39.451 --> 01:20:40.284
<v Speaker 1>TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the pace of technological </v>

1764
01:20:42.871 --> 01:20:43.704
<v Speaker 1>development is something that nobody has</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever even come close in human history </v>

1765
01:20:47.071 --> 01:20:47.904
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we are in a place where it's where </v>

1766
01:20:49.411 --> 01:20:50.244
<v Speaker 1>really an uncharted territory where the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the human mind has evolved so much from </v>

1767
01:20:54.601 --> 01:20:58.710
<v Speaker 1>one where happy monkeys running around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we are now,</v>

1768
01:20:58.711 --> 01:20:59.544
<v Speaker 1>we have these tools to do stuff that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>are really not prepared to deal with to </v>

1769
01:21:03.091 --> 01:21:08.091
<v Speaker 1>a large degree and Swiss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of a big open question I how,</v>

1770
01:21:09.060 --> 01:21:10.470
<v Speaker 1>where do we go from here?</v>

1771
01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:13.350
<v Speaker 1>Because there's no previous model that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can say,</v>

1772
01:21:13.351 --> 01:21:14.184
<v Speaker 1>well that one time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>3000 years ago when they invented the </v>

1773
01:21:16.531 --> 01:21:18.300
<v Speaker 1>Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they handled it this way.</v>

1774
01:21:18.301 --> 01:21:20.430
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's nothing like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1775
01:21:20.431 --> 01:21:21.264
<v Speaker 1>the tools we have are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our disposals are unlike anything that </v>

1776
01:21:24.301 --> 01:21:29.301
<v Speaker 1>has ever happened before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's how the case is sort of,</v>

1777
01:21:29.361 --> 01:21:30.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually he is three.</v>

1778
01:21:30.481 --> 01:21:32.610
<v Speaker 1>You can see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh you learned this lesson.</v>

1779
01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:37.410
<v Speaker 1>You can definitely learn about human </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature and how the human mind works.</v>

1780
01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:38.273
<v Speaker 1>But then from that you have to predict </v>
<v Speaker 1>how the human mind will be applied to a </v>

1781
01:21:40.801 --> 01:21:41.634
<v Speaker 1>context that's unlike anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any other contests that ever faced does </v>

1782
01:21:44.991 --> 01:21:45.824
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the big concern is that the </v>

1783
01:21:47.251 --> 01:21:48.084
<v Speaker 1>human mind will create an artificial </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind that won't take into consideration </v>

1784
01:21:51.841 --> 01:21:56.841
<v Speaker 1>any of the previous cultural ideals that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've supported and just go run rampant.</v>

1785
01:21:56.940 --> 01:21:57.773
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Darpa has created an a robot that </v>

1786
01:22:00.571 --> 01:22:01.630
<v Speaker 1>I've been raving about.</v>

1787
01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:03.450
<v Speaker 1>It drives me crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called the eater robot.</v>

1788
01:22:03.550 --> 01:22:04.470
<v Speaker 1>I t.</v>
<v Speaker 1>R.</v>

1789
01:22:05.220 --> 01:22:05.930
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1790
01:22:05.930 --> 01:22:06.763
<v Speaker 1>it operates on biological material,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning it fee is fueled by eating </v>

1791
01:22:11.761 --> 01:22:13.490
<v Speaker 1>bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1792
01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:17.040
<v Speaker 1>What could possibly go wrong with that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea is that on the battlefield,</v>

1793
01:22:17.070 --> 01:22:20.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure they're not talking about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've conveniently left this,</v>

1794
01:22:20.521 --> 01:22:23.020
<v Speaker 1>like one of the things that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it may be you could eat plants,</v>

1795
01:22:23.310 --> 01:22:24.143
<v Speaker 1>maybe you could eat a rabbit or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something or maybe give you fucking </v>

1796
01:22:26.401 --> 01:22:28.350
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like my,</v>

1797
01:22:28.380 --> 01:22:29.213
<v Speaker 1>my number one concern with all this </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff is that I think it's happening so </v>

1798
01:22:33.031 --> 01:22:33.864
<v Speaker 1>fast and so many things are taking place</v>
<v Speaker 1>in so many different realms when it </v>

1799
01:22:37.141 --> 01:22:37.974
<v Speaker 1>comes to innovation that this stuff will</v>
<v Speaker 1>just catch up to us before we even </v>

1800
01:22:40.951 --> 01:22:43.740
<v Speaker 1>recognize it's happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it will be too late for sure.</v>

1801
01:22:43.770 --> 01:22:46.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even just forget every single us,</v>

1802
01:22:46.191 --> 01:22:47.550
<v Speaker 1>even just the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1803
01:22:47.820 --> 01:22:48.620
<v Speaker 1>atomic bomb.</v>

1804
01:22:48.620 --> 01:22:53.010
<v Speaker 1>See Schlau for the last ever since we </v>
<v Speaker 1>started from the 1940 still today,</v>

1805
01:22:53.370 --> 01:22:55.650
<v Speaker 1>there have been some seriously close </v>
<v Speaker 1>calls.</v>

1806
01:22:56.250 --> 01:22:57.490
<v Speaker 1>There was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1807
01:22:57.680 --> 01:22:59.640
<v Speaker 1>I remember to one that was wanting the </v>
<v Speaker 1>1980s,</v>

1808
01:22:59.641 --> 01:23:02.220
<v Speaker 1>I think right before the end of the Cold</v>
<v Speaker 1>War where there was,</v>

1809
01:23:02.620 --> 01:23:03.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia,</v>

1810
01:23:04.220 --> 01:23:05.053
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy to his boring job where they're </v>

1811
01:23:06.220 --> 01:23:07.053
<v Speaker 1>supposed to look for missiles from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States and nothing ever happened </v>

1812
01:23:09.941 --> 01:23:11.770
<v Speaker 1>day after day after day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

1813
01:23:11.771 --> 01:23:13.810
<v Speaker 1>one day there's a bleep on the radar and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

1814
01:23:14.020 --> 01:23:15.510
<v Speaker 1>oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's the guy,</v>

1815
01:23:15.511 --> 01:23:17.350
<v Speaker 1>he's jaw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to Cooley superiors.</v>

1816
01:23:17.470 --> 01:23:20.410
<v Speaker 1>And then if he does the old site,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are going to press the button.</v>

1817
01:23:20.860 --> 01:23:21.371
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1818
01:23:21.371 --> 01:23:21.531
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1819
01:23:21.531 --> 01:23:21.940
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

1820
01:23:21.940 --> 01:23:24.310
<v Speaker 1>let's come down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe this wrong.</v>

1821
01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.360
<v Speaker 1>I made a concern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that stupid.</v>

1822
01:23:26.361 --> 01:23:28.660
<v Speaker 1>They will not send one atomic bomb if </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd do it,</v>

1823
01:23:28.661 --> 01:23:29.410
<v Speaker 1>they send a bunch.</v>

1824
01:23:29.410 --> 01:23:31.250
<v Speaker 1>So these must be a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's hold that.</v>

1825
01:23:31.260 --> 01:23:34.830
<v Speaker 1>I relax 30 minutes later and other bleep</v>
<v Speaker 1>and other beliefs and other,</v>

1826
01:23:34.831 --> 01:23:35.860
<v Speaker 1>but he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh shit,</v>

1827
01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:37.660
<v Speaker 1>they are set and you get a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>atomic bombs.</v>

1828
01:23:37.661 --> 01:23:38.494
<v Speaker 1>This is the real deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Guy Steele doesn't do what he's </v>

1829
01:23:41.681 --> 01:23:45.040
<v Speaker 1>supposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's feels like if I make this call,</v>

1830
01:23:45.190 --> 01:23:46.023
<v Speaker 1>nuclear war starts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to be [inaudible] was in percent </v>

1831
01:23:48.671 --> 01:23:49.504
<v Speaker 1>convenience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The evidence in front of them is pretty </v>

1832
01:23:51.161 --> 01:23:53.470
<v Speaker 1>solid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I still don't feel it.</v>

1833
01:23:54.040 --> 01:23:55.960
<v Speaker 1>And then five minutes later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the beliefs go off.</v>

1834
01:23:55.961 --> 01:23:59.590
<v Speaker 1>It was a mistake on the radar and there </v>
<v Speaker 1>was like some random bleep and uh,</v>

1835
01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:04.090
<v Speaker 1>the guy promptly there and get bottle of</v>
<v Speaker 1>vodka straight because he was like,</v>

1836
01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:06.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the almost caused world war three.</v>

1837
01:24:06.701 --> 01:24:08.590
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1838
01:24:08.591 --> 01:24:09.424
<v Speaker 1>most of us all their lives now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some Russian dude in the 1980s who </v>

1839
01:24:13.451 --> 01:24:14.284
<v Speaker 1>decided not to do what he was supposed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to and then the old because of this </v>

1840
01:24:18.561 --> 01:24:22.030
<v Speaker 1>stupid mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid bug in the radar.</v>

1841
01:24:22.590 --> 01:24:23.423
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when you know that the </v>

1842
01:24:24.911 --> 01:24:28.990
<v Speaker 1>technologies we have are way too much </v>
<v Speaker 1>for our decision make or way.</v>

1843
01:24:28.991 --> 01:24:32.280
<v Speaker 1>Not enough because it should be exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1844
01:24:32.610 --> 01:24:34.770
<v Speaker 1>That's the other side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>

1845
01:24:34.870 --> 01:24:36.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was it a flock of birds or was it,</v>

1846
01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know what the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1847
01:24:39.241 --> 01:24:41.050
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of shit terrifies me.</v>

1848
01:24:41.070 --> 01:24:45.430
<v Speaker 1>It's just the ability to do something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that without the,</v>

1849
01:24:45.460 --> 01:24:49.150
<v Speaker 1>the understanding or the discipline to </v>
<v Speaker 1>create it is really nuts.</v>

1850
01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:51.520
<v Speaker 1>I always liken it to like giving a baby </v>
<v Speaker 1>a gun.</v>

1851
01:24:51.550 --> 01:24:54.700
<v Speaker 1>Like the baby didn't figure out how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>use that gun.</v>

1852
01:24:54.701 --> 01:24:57.880
<v Speaker 1>They didn't invent it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know how to load a around,</v>

1853
01:24:57.881 --> 01:24:59.260
<v Speaker 1>but they can just fucking pull that </v>
<v Speaker 1>trigger.</v>

1854
01:24:59.290 --> 01:25:00.130
<v Speaker 1>But by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

1855
01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:01.233
<v Speaker 1>And people can die that that can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People get killed by toddlers all the </v>

1856
01:25:04.661 --> 01:25:05.494
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People leave their person there and </v>

1857
01:25:07.421 --> 01:25:08.980
<v Speaker 1>their bag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>toddler picks it up,</v>

1858
01:25:08.981 --> 01:25:09.850
<v Speaker 1>shoots himself.</v>

1859
01:25:09.910 --> 01:25:12.400
<v Speaker 1>Shoot someone else happens over at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1860
01:25:12.550 --> 01:25:13.600
<v Speaker 1>All the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1861
01:25:14.950 --> 01:25:15.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's um,</v>

1862
01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:19.690
<v Speaker 1>human beings have access to all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>technologies that we would never be able</v>

1863
01:25:19.691 --> 01:25:20.820
<v Speaker 1>to figure it out on our own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1864
01:25:20.980 --> 01:25:21.813
<v Speaker 1>And we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we with those great with the great </v>

1865
01:25:24.281 --> 01:25:26.290
<v Speaker 1>responsibility that comes with using </v>
<v Speaker 1>those things.</v>

1866
01:25:26.950 --> 01:25:31.330
<v Speaker 1>There should be some sort of great </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge that you have to acquire about</v>

1867
01:25:31.331 --> 01:25:32.164
<v Speaker 1>the thing itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like some sort of some reasonable </v>

1868
01:25:35.441 --> 01:25:39.880
<v Speaker 1>facsimile of like what it took to create</v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing.</v>

1869
01:25:39.970 --> 01:25:44.020
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] like some deep intensive </v>
<v Speaker 1>program like,</v>

1870
01:25:44.021 --> 01:25:45.370
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like this is how an engine was </v>

1872
01:25:49.391 --> 01:25:50.620
<v Speaker 1>developed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

1873
01:25:50.621 --> 01:25:51.454
<v Speaker 1>this is how breaks work this out and </v>

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1875
01:25:56.740 --> 01:25:59.860
<v Speaker 1>the same should be said about guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same should be said about everything.</v>

1876
01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:04.040
<v Speaker 1>We just have access to too much shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we would never be able to figure</v>

1877
01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:04.920
<v Speaker 3>out on our own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1889
01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:31.553
<v Speaker 3>or in your compound that we'd float </v>
<v Speaker 3>tanks and stuff to survive depaul </v>

1890
01:26:35.361 --> 01:26:39.770
<v Speaker 3>collapse when the zombies attack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to be a survivor.</v>

1891
01:26:40.260 --> 01:26:43.070
<v Speaker 3>I mean you maybe one of your ancestors </v>
<v Speaker 3>to survive,</v>

1892
01:26:43.071 --> 01:26:44.990
<v Speaker 3>so he should survive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you answered,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Surviving doesn't look like a fun one.</v>

1895
01:26:49.700 --> 01:26:50.181
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1896
01:26:50.181 --> 01:26:51.014
<v Speaker 3>Like if you were around in Indonesia </v>
<v Speaker 3>70,000 years ago when the big one blue </v>

1897
01:26:55.071 --> 01:26:56.900
<v Speaker 3>and you were one of the survivors and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

1898
01:26:56.950 --> 01:26:57.783
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>picking through the wreckage of </v>

1899
01:26:59.210 --> 01:27:01.650
<v Speaker 3>civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not good times stuff.</v>

1900
01:27:01.690 --> 01:27:03.170
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1901
01:27:03.470 --> 01:27:05.330
<v Speaker 3>But then again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it wasn't for them,</v>

1902
01:27:05.331 --> 01:27:07.790
<v Speaker 3>we wouldn't have Disneyland.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we chase it,</v>

1903
01:27:08.150 --> 01:27:09.400
<v Speaker 3>bang part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm calling.</v>

1904
01:27:09.490 --> 01:27:11.180
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't for them.</v>

1905
01:27:11.181 --> 01:27:12.260
<v Speaker 3>No netflix.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>

1906
01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:13.273
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No iphone because of people in </v>

1907
01:27:15.561 --> 01:27:16.510
<v Speaker 3>Indonesia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1908
01:27:16.670 --> 01:27:17.503
<v Speaker 3>because those people did eat those dead </v>
<v Speaker 3>people because those people did figure </v>

1909
01:27:21.261 --> 01:27:22.094
<v Speaker 3>out a way to somehow or another get </v>
<v Speaker 3>enough nutrients from whatever the fuck </v>

1910
01:27:24.591 --> 01:27:27.770
<v Speaker 3>they ate to compensate for the fact they</v>
<v Speaker 3>were involved in nuclear winter.</v>

1911
01:27:28.130 --> 01:27:29.780
<v Speaker 3>That's not man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1912
01:27:30.260 --> 01:27:32.000
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>

1913
01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:33.553
<v Speaker 3>but it makes you realize,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is we the people that are </v>

1914
01:27:37.011 --> 01:27:39.020
<v Speaker 3>listening to this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people that are alive today,</v>

1915
01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:40.190
<v Speaker 3>we're not going to make it.</v>

1916
01:27:40.660 --> 01:27:41.493
<v Speaker 3>It's just we are not going to make it </v>
<v Speaker 3>like everyone's so hopeful that the </v>

1917
01:27:44.091 --> 01:27:44.924
<v Speaker 3>human race is gonna make it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's one of the reasons why we </v>

1918
01:27:47.841 --> 01:27:49.850
<v Speaker 3>have offspring and loved ones and </v>
<v Speaker 3>friends.</v>

1919
01:27:49.851 --> 01:27:52.190
<v Speaker 3>And even if I'm gone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want everyone else to be happy.</v>

1920
01:27:52.250 --> 01:27:53.720
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a great time while I'm here.</v>

1921
01:27:53.721 --> 01:27:56.000
<v Speaker 3>Don't cry for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no one's making it.</v>

1922
01:27:56.030 --> 01:27:58.760
<v Speaker 3>They're not going to make it either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're just prolonging their life.</v>

1923
01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:02.570
<v Speaker 3>Like everyone's life is going to come to</v>
<v Speaker 3>a wall.</v>

1924
01:28:02.900 --> 01:28:06.920
<v Speaker 3>Everyone loud the game works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we're cool with that.</v>

1925
01:28:07.250 --> 01:28:09.260
<v Speaker 3>We're cool with grandma dying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Grandma died,</v>

1926
01:28:09.261 --> 01:28:10.094
<v Speaker 3>but she was 97 years old when she died.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was a wonderful woman and she was </v>

1927
01:28:13.011 --> 01:28:15.020
<v Speaker 3>loved by many.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's cool with that.</v>

1928
01:28:15.380 --> 01:28:16.213
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not cool with everybody dying all </v>

1929
01:28:17.781 --> 01:28:18.860
<v Speaker 3>at once.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1930
01:28:18.900 --> 01:28:20.780
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the end of the experiment.</v>

1931
01:28:21.090 --> 01:28:23.150
<v Speaker 3>This is the end of the process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck no,</v>

1932
01:28:23.151 --> 01:28:25.840
<v Speaker 3>it's not the end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just we're going to,</v>

1933
01:28:25.850 --> 01:28:28.310
<v Speaker 3>everyone's going to die and then we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to restart with monkeys.</v>

1934
01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:30.410
<v Speaker 3>It's going to take another few million </v>
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>

1935
01:28:30.411 --> 01:28:31.940
<v Speaker 3>but the chimps would eventually become </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

1936
01:28:31.941 --> 01:28:32.840
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

1937
01:28:32.841 --> 01:28:33.674
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of what I am saying is that if</v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody's going to survive is going to </v>

1938
01:28:36.321 --> 01:28:37.154
<v Speaker 3>be the people are leaving close to </v>
<v Speaker 3>hunting and gathering conditions today </v>

1939
01:28:39.891 --> 01:28:43.190
<v Speaker 3>that are seen as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most backward people in the ward are</v>

1940
01:28:43.191 --> 01:28:44.024
<v Speaker 3>the ones who actually have a shelter </v>
<v Speaker 3>that making 18 a short apocalyptic </v>

1941
01:28:46.521 --> 01:28:47.720
<v Speaker 3>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1942
01:28:47.721 --> 01:28:49.310
<v Speaker 3>Like people in the Amazon or something </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

1943
01:28:49.311 --> 01:28:50.510
<v Speaker 3>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're probably the only ones that have</v>

1944
01:28:50.511 --> 01:28:51.344
<v Speaker 3>a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

1945
01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:52.313
<v Speaker 3>What's up mad at Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you see this going around the story </v>

1946
01:28:53.781 --> 01:28:56.060
<v Speaker 3>about this new company that can upload </v>
<v Speaker 3>your brain,</v>

1947
01:28:56.061 --> 01:28:56.894
<v Speaker 3>but it kills you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What a startup is pitching a mind </v>

1948
01:29:00.810 --> 01:29:04.050
<v Speaker 3>uploading service that is 100% fatal.</v>

1949
01:29:05.190 --> 01:29:06.023
<v Speaker 3>I think they're taking like people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are already terminal patients and </v>

1950
01:29:08.311 --> 01:29:10.020

01:29:12.261 --> 01:29:17.070
<v Speaker 3>they're going to give you some bullshit </v>
<v Speaker 3>scrambled version of what your,</v>

1954
01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:22.080
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be all swa stickers like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we found grandpa's brain and a,</v>

1955

<v Speaker 3>we're going to upload it now and you'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>be able to look into his thoughts out.</v>

1956

<v Speaker 3>It's all dicks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>GRANDPA's,</v>

<v Speaker 3>intact for hundreds of years,</v>

1959
01:29:37.141 --> 01:29:40.830
<v Speaker 3>maybe thousands as a statue of frozen </v>
<v Speaker 3>glass.</v>

1960
01:29:40.890 --> 01:29:45.890
<v Speaker 3>What the idea is that some day in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>future scientists will scan your bricked</v>

1961
01:29:47.580 --> 01:29:48.413
<v Speaker 3>brain and turn it into a computer </v>
<v Speaker 3>simulation so they didn't even know how </v>

1962
01:29:51.001 --> 01:29:51.834
<v Speaker 3>to do it yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is bullshit that way someone liked </v>

1963
01:29:55.020 --> 01:29:56.940
<v Speaker 3>a lot like you though.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Not Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You will smell the flowers again in a </v>

1965
01:30:00.361 --> 01:30:02.450
<v Speaker 3>data server somewhere.</v>

<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1967
01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:11.000
<v Speaker 3>The stories that grizzly twist though </v>
<v Speaker 3>for NEC tomes procedure to work,</v>

1968
01:30:11.940 --> 01:30:12.773
<v Speaker 3>it's essential that the brain be fresh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The company says its plan is to connect </v>

1969
01:30:16.561 --> 01:30:21.561
<v Speaker 3>people with terminal illnesses to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>heart lung machine in order to pump it's</v>

1970
01:30:21.571 --> 01:30:22.404
<v Speaker 3>mix of scientific and bombing chemicals </v>
<v Speaker 3>into the big cardioid arteries in their </v>

1971
01:30:28.621 --> 01:30:30.180
<v Speaker 3>next,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Thank God you put them under before you </v>
<v Speaker 3>kill him.</v>

1974
01:30:35.010 --> 01:30:35.843
<v Speaker 3>Cause we will want them to experience </v>
<v Speaker 3>any pain for they go into the great </v>

1975
01:30:38.490 --> 01:30:42.450

<v Speaker 3>Do you know that?</v>

1981
01:30:53.730 --> 01:30:56.670
<v Speaker 3>To have the opportunity to be one of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>first people to die on Mars,</v>

1982
01:30:56.730 --> 01:30:58.500
<v Speaker 3>hundreds of thousands of people signed </v>
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

1983
01:30:58.530 --> 01:30:59.363
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to be the first to be </v>

1984
01:31:00.690 --> 01:31:03.420
<v Speaker 3>locked in a space ship for six months </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a bunch of other people.</v>

1985
01:31:03.421 --> 01:31:06.060
<v Speaker 3>So fucking stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're willing to die on Mars.</v>

1986
01:31:06.480 --> 01:31:07.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you get there.</v>

1987
01:31:07.940 --> 01:31:10.170
<v Speaker 3>They're just talking about social </v>
<v Speaker 3>justice the entire way,</v>

1988
01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:11.820
<v Speaker 3>all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the way over there.</v>

1989
01:31:11.821 --> 01:31:14.520
<v Speaker 3>Talking about veganism and social </v>
<v Speaker 3>justice and,</v>

1990
01:31:15.500 --> 01:31:16.950
<v Speaker 3>oh man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1991
01:31:17.730 --> 01:31:21.900
<v Speaker 3>Elon Musk on first Mars explorer as good</v>
<v Speaker 3>chance you'll die or chance.</v>

1992
01:31:22.410 --> 01:31:24.090
<v Speaker 3>How about a hundred percent you're going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to die with you.</v>

1993
01:31:24.091 --> 01:31:25.780
<v Speaker 3>Stay here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stay here.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Everyone's dying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to die.</v>

1996
01:31:29.820 --> 01:31:30.653
<v Speaker 3>That's the fucked up thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just don't want everybody to die all </v>

1997
01:31:32.401 --> 01:31:35.550
<v Speaker 3>at once.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're cool with small groups.</v>

1998
01:31:35.551 --> 01:31:39.240
<v Speaker 3>People that are brown that die in caves </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the other part of the world.</v>

1999
01:31:39.270 --> 01:31:40.860
<v Speaker 3>If we could be convinced they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>primitive,</v>

2000
01:31:41.180 --> 01:31:44.150
<v Speaker 3>they hold these ridiculous beliefs and </v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

2001
01:31:44.160 --> 01:31:45.090
<v Speaker 3>we don't even know them.</v>

2002
01:31:45.180 --> 01:31:46.013
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we're just going to kill them with </v>

2003
01:31:46.801 --> 01:31:47.550
<v Speaker 3>robots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2004
01:31:47.550 --> 01:31:49.130
<v Speaker 3>It's somebody out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh cares.</v>

01:31:49.170 --> 01:31:50.410
<v Speaker 3>It's not us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2006
01:31:50.520 --> 01:31:53.820
<v Speaker 3>I think just the rate of change is </v>
<v Speaker 3>happening so fast.</v>

2007
01:31:53.821 --> 01:31:55.440
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be a lot of dumb shit like</v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

2008
01:31:55.680 --> 01:31:57.360
<v Speaker 3>It happens along the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>

2009
01:31:57.361 --> 01:31:58.194
<v Speaker 3>like the bell bottoms of technology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like what is the thought fuck were </v>

2010
01:32:01.241 --> 01:32:03.090
<v Speaker 3>they thinking and it's just going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>keep,</v>

2011
01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:04.780
<v Speaker 3>keep happening like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2012
01:32:04.781 --> 01:32:07.180
<v Speaker 3>I mean you think about even most of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff that we do today,</v>

2013
01:32:07.181 --> 01:32:09.940
<v Speaker 3>like which foods are okay to eat and </v>
<v Speaker 3>which one's not?</v>

2014
01:32:09.970 --> 01:32:12.940
<v Speaker 3>How many people like to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh look at that.</v>

2015
01:32:12.970 --> 01:32:15.120
<v Speaker 3>Greg is gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had the wrong plants,</v>

2016
01:32:15.121 --> 01:32:17.680
<v Speaker 3>so let's make an older,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we do not eat that plant.</v>

2017
01:32:17.710 --> 01:32:18.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we share.</v>

2018
01:32:18.671 --> 01:32:20.470
<v Speaker 3>That's all greg eight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2019
01:32:20.471 --> 01:32:22.420
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like they should still eat it.</v>

2020
01:32:22.421 --> 01:32:25.000
<v Speaker 3>Let's try one more time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get my to eat it.</v>

2021
01:32:25.001 --> 01:32:27.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got an iron stomach.</v>

2022
01:32:27.790 --> 01:32:29.770
<v Speaker 3>The duties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>old carcasses and shit.</v>

2023
01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:33.513
<v Speaker 3>They had to like express it somehow or </v>
<v Speaker 3>another in a way that everybody would </v>

2024
01:32:36.131 --> 01:32:38.980
<v Speaker 3>remember it too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably in songs and shit.</v>

2025
01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:39.910
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2026
01:32:39.911 --> 01:32:41.310
<v Speaker 3>cause exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the other thing I would do.</v>

2027
01:32:41.311 --> 01:32:45.070
<v Speaker 3>You pass information in a society that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>not liter at and yet people did it.</v>

2028
01:32:45.071 --> 01:32:45.904
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you think about things like the </v>

2029
01:32:46.571 --> 01:32:47.404
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] or the all they say they </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know these long gas compositions </v>

2030
01:32:51.130 --> 01:32:53.500
<v Speaker 3>completely passed down orally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2031
01:32:53.501 --> 01:32:54.490
<v Speaker 3>without,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2032
01:32:54.491 --> 01:32:57.280
<v Speaker 3>by the time they wrote down was saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>to this down the road.</v>

2033
01:32:57.281 --> 01:32:58.114
<v Speaker 3>It's like that's some protein,</v>
<v Speaker 3>same thing that humans were able to do </v>

2034
01:33:01.901 --> 01:33:03.800
<v Speaker 3>in like memorize all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2035
01:33:03.820 --> 01:33:04.810
<v Speaker 3>Really it's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2036
01:33:04.811 --> 01:33:05.644
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking the other day about songs</v>
<v Speaker 3>like how crazy the technology of </v>

2037
01:33:09.370 --> 01:33:13.510
<v Speaker 3>remembering things through songs are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause if like he didn't go all the songs</v>

2038
01:33:13.511 --> 01:33:15.040
<v Speaker 3>you could sing along to the words.</v>

2039
01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:17.650
<v Speaker 3>Now think of how many poems that you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>recite.</v>

2040
01:33:18.250 --> 01:33:20.770
<v Speaker 3>It's like very few or stories that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can,</v>

2041
01:33:21.530 --> 01:33:23.260
<v Speaker 3>what poems?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe because they rhyme,</v>

2042
01:33:23.500 --> 01:33:26.800
<v Speaker 3>but reciting a story verbatim.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Almost none.</v>

2043
01:33:27.100 --> 01:33:29.740
<v Speaker 3>Very few.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like we were a,</v>

2044
01:33:29.741 --> 01:33:31.480
<v Speaker 3>at the common story the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were talking about,</v>

2045
01:33:31.481 --> 01:33:32.314
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2046
01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:34.780
<v Speaker 3>grammar and sentence structure and stuff</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

2047
01:33:35.020 --> 01:33:36.820
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I brought up those,</v>

2048
01:33:36.821 --> 01:33:37.654
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ABC afterschool things like conjunction </v>

2049
01:33:40.151 --> 01:33:40.984
<v Speaker 3>junction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's your function hook and up words </v>

2050
01:33:44.771 --> 01:33:47.140
<v Speaker 3>and phrases and clauses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2051
01:33:47.141 --> 01:33:49.000
<v Speaker 3>you know what it is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2052
01:33:49.001 --> 01:33:49.834
<v Speaker 3>I'm just a bill sitting here on Capitol </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hill and like they explain these things </v>

2053
01:33:54.601 --> 01:33:57.840
<v Speaker 3>in a way that you could remember fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>decades later.</v>

2054
01:33:57.880 --> 01:33:58.713
<v Speaker 3>You would never remember.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would never remember if it wasn't </v>

2055
01:34:01.481 --> 01:34:02.314
<v Speaker 3>for those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a guy named Ariosa was like </v>

2056
01:34:05.471 --> 01:34:06.400
<v Speaker 3>one of these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2057
01:34:06.850 --> 01:34:07.683
<v Speaker 3>like back when they had the council of </v>
<v Speaker 3>nicea and they kind of decided what is </v>

2058
01:34:11.260 --> 01:34:14.980
<v Speaker 3>real Christianity going to be a while we</v>
<v Speaker 3>decided to be the fake stuff.</v>

2059
01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:16.433
<v Speaker 3>Ariosa was on the losing side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but part of the theme that meeting </v>

2060
01:34:18.711 --> 01:34:21.970
<v Speaker 3>seemingly popular is that he put on all </v>
<v Speaker 3>this theology and songs.</v>

2061
01:34:22.030 --> 01:34:22.863
<v Speaker 3>Exactly like what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would be super complicated thing </v>

2062
01:34:26.181 --> 01:34:27.014
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2063
01:34:27.130 --> 01:34:31.410
<v Speaker 3>Jesus bees kind of like God the father </v>
<v Speaker 3>but not really and Dah,</v>

2064
01:34:31.411 --> 01:34:32.244
<v Speaker 3>Dah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dah,</v>

2065
01:34:32.380 --> 01:34:33.213
<v Speaker 3>really brainy stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Puto like a silly song that the guy </v>

2066
01:34:37.001 --> 01:34:38.950
<v Speaker 3>would sing while he's baking bread and </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

2067
01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:39.833
<v Speaker 3>And so he was closely Paul polar because</v>
<v Speaker 3>he figured that's how people pick up </v>

2068
01:34:43.961 --> 01:34:45.130
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is up.</v>

2069
01:34:45.131 --> 01:34:47.200
<v Speaker 3>People pick up stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

2070
01:34:47.201 --> 01:34:48.760
<v Speaker 3>To this day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2071
01:34:48.790 --> 01:34:52.540
<v Speaker 3>Like pronouns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that that song pronouns take the</v>

2072
01:34:52.541 --> 01:34:53.374
<v Speaker 3>place of a noun cause saying all those </v>
<v Speaker 3>nouns over and over can really wear you </v>

2073
01:34:56.711 --> 01:34:57.980
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They need a</v>

2074
01:34:57.980 --> 01:34:59.280
<v Speaker 1>missed too many days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>

2075
01:34:59.330 --> 01:35:03.140
<v Speaker 1>Good job that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that stuff for whatever reason sticks of</v>

2076
01:35:03.141 --> 01:35:03.974
<v Speaker 1>course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder why like making things rhyme </v>

2077
01:35:06.550 --> 01:35:07.383
<v Speaker 1>and and putting them in song has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular profound effect on your </v>

2078
01:35:11.241 --> 01:35:12.120
<v Speaker 1>memory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2079
01:35:12.130 --> 01:35:14.030
<v Speaker 1>it is funny cause even when you look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>babies,</v>

2080
01:35:14.031 --> 01:35:14.864
<v Speaker 1>you know they respond to music so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have that immediate like Sam </v>

2081
01:35:18.401 --> 01:35:19.234
<v Speaker 1>sounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that clique with the developing mind </v>

2082
01:35:21.210 --> 01:35:22.940
<v Speaker 1>have a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't need to have culture.</v>

2083
01:35:22.941 --> 01:35:26.240
<v Speaker 1>You don't need to have knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't need to have as baby.</v>

2084
01:35:26.241 --> 01:35:28.340
<v Speaker 1>You can still pick up seeing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>remembered.</v>

2085
01:35:28.341 --> 01:35:29.174
<v Speaker 1>I mean yeah or sometime you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody put some music and one note to </v>

2086
01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:35.030
<v Speaker 1>goes into babies immediately recognize </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2087
01:35:35.031 --> 01:35:37.370
<v Speaker 1>Just like I know what this is is that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the one I enjoy.</v>

2088
01:35:37.390 --> 01:35:40.670
<v Speaker 1>And as you do it the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way is fucking hilarious.</v>

2089
01:35:40.671 --> 01:35:41.630
<v Speaker 1>Was in the,</v>

<v Speaker 1>sorry I can't do that like it though.</v>

2115
01:36:56.270 --> 01:36:57.103
<v Speaker 1>The thing about baby stuff is like </v>
<v Speaker 1>babies like baby stuff or even little </v>

2116
01:37:00.531 --> 01:37:01.760

<v Speaker 1>Like my kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of really fucking dumb shows,</v>

2118
01:37:04.790 --> 01:37:07.610
<v Speaker 1>but they love them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like what can you do?</v>

<v Speaker 1>but it's not stupid to them.</v>

2121
01:37:12.500 --> 01:37:15.320
<v Speaker 1>I can tolerate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we balance it with something else,</v>

2122
01:37:15.321 --> 01:37:16.154
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2123
01:37:16.370 --> 01:37:17.420

<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

2124
01:37:17.421 --> 01:37:19.970
<v Speaker 1>It's part of your developmental stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good for you,</v>

2125
01:37:20.390 --> 01:37:22.520
<v Speaker 1>but give me something here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2126
01:37:22.521 --> 01:37:23.001
<v Speaker 1>let,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let,</v>

2127
01:37:23.001 --> 01:37:23.834
<v Speaker 1>let's find a middle ground here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or we can listen to the same music or </v>

2128
01:37:26.181 --> 01:37:27.014
<v Speaker 1>watch something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's where I recognize I may have </v>

2129
01:37:29.511 --> 01:37:30.344
<v Speaker 1>done irreparable damage to my offspring </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I realized the other day we </v>

2130
01:37:34.311 --> 01:37:35.144
<v Speaker 1>watch a movie and my daughters come and </v>
<v Speaker 1>to basically say this is the coolest </v>

2131
01:37:38.511 --> 01:37:42.000
<v Speaker 1>thing ever was like it says good as </v>
<v Speaker 1>Conan the barbarian.</v>

2132
01:37:42.010 --> 01:37:43.580
<v Speaker 1>That I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

2133
01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:47.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad you were my daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was she talking about the books?</v>

2134
01:37:47.150 --> 01:37:48.770
<v Speaker 1>I was just talking about the movie </v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

2135
01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:49.640
<v Speaker 1>Hold off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she like,</v>

2136
01:37:49.641 --> 01:37:50.960
<v Speaker 1>she loves the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2137
01:37:50.961 --> 01:37:55.250
<v Speaker 1>the one corner and that was [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 1>now the 1982 one of course.</v>

2138
01:37:55.251 --> 01:37:59.170
<v Speaker 1>See I read their old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the t our stories and wow.</v>

2139
01:37:59.220 --> 01:38:00.053
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I changed the language slightly cause </v>

2140
01:38:01.011 --> 01:38:01.844
<v Speaker 1>sometime in the language is a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you need to really have a crazy </v>

2141
01:38:04.381 --> 01:38:06.540
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary for an eight year olds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to pick it up.</v>

2142
01:38:06.541 --> 01:38:08.400
<v Speaker 1>So I kind of tweak it a lethal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then,</v>

2143
01:38:08.410 --> 01:38:10.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the good stuff is there and uh,</v>

2144
01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:15.270
<v Speaker 1>I feel like the best Conan could have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been Jason Momoa.</v>

2145
01:38:15.510 --> 01:38:18.650
<v Speaker 1>They just gave him a shit movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The script was like,</v>

2146
01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:20.970
<v Speaker 1>my mind is so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's very good.</v>

2147
01:38:20.971 --> 01:38:24.060
<v Speaker 1>He looks like a fucking barbarian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you believe it.</v>

2148
01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:24.913
<v Speaker 1>Perfect big giant guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's also not built like a </v>

2149
01:38:27.730 --> 01:38:28.563
<v Speaker 1>bodybuilder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just built like a guy who was in </v>

2150
01:38:29.911 --> 01:38:30.744
<v Speaker 1>really good shape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you would think Conan would be </v>

2151
01:38:32.191 --> 01:38:33.180
<v Speaker 1>there he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2152
01:38:34.050 --> 01:38:38.490
<v Speaker 1>I think he was the best Konan he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>seemed to me to be the most realistic.</v>

2153
01:38:38.850 --> 01:38:40.470
<v Speaker 1>Maybe could he use a little bit more gym</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

2154
01:38:40.680 --> 01:38:43.800
<v Speaker 1>but not nothing crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem you had this crepes,</v>

2155
01:38:43.860 --> 01:38:44.693
<v Speaker 1>that's something that's anti frustrates </v>
<v Speaker 1>me when you see like all the elements </v>

2156
01:38:47.221 --> 01:38:50.410
<v Speaker 1>are there and the screenwriting socks </v>
<v Speaker 1>says like,</v>

2157
01:38:50.430 --> 01:38:51.640
<v Speaker 1>come on man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sucks.</v>

2158
01:38:52.860 --> 01:38:56.150
<v Speaker 1>Just straight dog shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he was fucking great as Conan.</v>

2159
01:38:56.160 --> 01:38:57.380
<v Speaker 1>Like you believed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

2160
01:38:58.090 --> 01:39:00.570
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just looked evil enough and it looked</v>

2161
01:39:00.571 --> 01:39:05.571
<v Speaker 1>like a guy who really was a sword </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighter who really did live in that era.</v>

2162
01:39:07.710 --> 01:39:10.650
<v Speaker 1>Whereas Conan played by Arnold </v>
<v Speaker 1>Schwarzenegger.</v>

2163
01:39:10.690 --> 01:39:11.370
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

2164
01:39:11.370 --> 01:39:12.960
<v Speaker 1>what's the guy's got no armpit hair.</v>

2165
01:39:13.580 --> 01:39:18.360
<v Speaker 1>It's completely shaved down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Built like a brick shit.</v>

2166
01:39:18.361 --> 01:39:19.051
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>

2167
01:39:19.051 --> 01:39:20.970
<v Speaker 1>it was freakishly big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2168
01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.330
<v Speaker 1>That's actually a picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looks fairly reasonable there.</v>

2169
01:39:23.350 --> 01:39:26.420
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go to layer to think about new,</v>

2170
01:39:26.421 --> 01:39:27.254
<v Speaker 1>it's actually quite a bit leaner and </v>
<v Speaker 1>those days that he was in his </v>

2171
01:39:29.221 --> 01:39:30.510
<v Speaker 1>bodybuilder day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2172
01:39:31.680 --> 01:39:33.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That one was just all so,</v>

2173
01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:34.830
<v Speaker 1>but he was still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely to do,</v>

2174
01:39:34.831 --> 01:39:35.664
<v Speaker 1>it had been doing some bench pressing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't someone just swine club bells </v>

2175
01:39:39.061 --> 01:39:39.894
<v Speaker 1>around and I mean he didn't get those </v>
<v Speaker 1>muscles just by pushing the wheel of </v>

2176
01:39:42.541 --> 01:39:44.070
<v Speaker 1>pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was part of it too.</v>

2177
01:39:44.130 --> 01:39:45.420
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's definitely that.</v>

2178
01:39:45.421 --> 01:39:47.340
<v Speaker 1>A little bit of that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>

2179
01:39:47.341 --> 01:39:48.470
<v Speaker 1>On that note,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been,</v>

2180
01:39:48.471 --> 01:39:49.304
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last couple of years I've been </v>

2181
01:39:50.701 --> 01:39:53.670
<v Speaker 1>playing a lot in that world with </v>
<v Speaker 1>screenwriting and stuff.</v>

2182
01:39:53.700 --> 01:39:56.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm so excited with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just getting,</v>

2183
01:39:56.060 --> 01:39:56.893
<v Speaker 1>cause you know the thing that I enjoy </v>
<v Speaker 1>like in [inaudible] on fire and stuff </v>

2184
01:39:58.771 --> 01:39:59.604
<v Speaker 1>like that at historic tiling and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>realize I ended up doing that in </v>

2185
01:40:02.220 --> 01:40:03.530
<v Speaker 1>whatever field I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2186
01:40:03.540 --> 01:40:06.060
<v Speaker 1>whether when I'm teaching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of it is storytelling.</v>

2187
01:40:06.060 --> 01:40:08.430
<v Speaker 1>When um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>history on fire is storytelling.</v>

2188
01:40:08.431 --> 01:40:12.210
<v Speaker 1>And so I started playing a little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's getting writings because I had good</v>

2189
01:40:12.220 --> 01:40:14.250
<v Speaker 1>hookups man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm having so much fun.</v>

2190
01:40:14.340 --> 01:40:18.150
<v Speaker 1>It's like when you're writing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there's the stuff that looks,</v>

2191
01:40:18.690 --> 01:40:19.523
<v Speaker 1>there are a few,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they are all mostly historical </v>

2192
01:40:21.211 --> 01:40:25.760
<v Speaker 1>fiction kind of stories and one of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now look really damn promising but</v>

2193
01:40:25.761 --> 01:40:26.594
<v Speaker 1>they have threatened me to chop off my </v>
<v Speaker 1>bowls and nailed them two or three if I </v>

2194
01:40:29.971 --> 01:40:30.804
<v Speaker 1>talk about it so I can really bring it </v>
<v Speaker 1>up because that one actually has a shot </v>

2195
01:40:33.511 --> 01:40:36.720
<v Speaker 1>at making it a okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are others seeing swear.</v>

2196
01:40:36.721 --> 01:40:40.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm much more kind of early development.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like for example,</v>

2197
01:40:40.650 --> 01:40:43.190
<v Speaker 1>Oh I saw you got outside the Frank </v>
<v Speaker 1>Frazetta painting.</v>

2198
01:40:43.220 --> 01:40:44.053
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Satta the granddaughter of Frank </v>

2199
01:40:46.650 --> 01:40:47.483
<v Speaker 1>Wants to develop one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the characters that are </v>

2200
01:40:50.460 --> 01:40:53.530
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] girls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's the one who does it all right,</v>

2201
01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:54.753
<v Speaker 1>Shannon.</v>

2202
01:40:54.880 --> 01:40:55.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's awesome.</v>

2203
01:40:55.570 --> 01:40:57.240
<v Speaker 3>She's super sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2204
01:40:57.470 --> 01:40:59.110
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she started asking,</v>

2205
01:40:59.111 --> 01:40:59.944
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I showed them some of my writing were </v>

2206
01:41:00.701 --> 01:41:01.810
<v Speaker 3>chatting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She liked it.</v>

2207
01:41:01.811 --> 01:41:05.050
<v Speaker 3>And so she wanted me to develop like one</v>
<v Speaker 3>of those characters are seen to,</v>

2208
01:41:05.051 --> 01:41:06.940
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>create a ward around it,</v>

2209
01:41:06.941 --> 01:41:08.400
<v Speaker 3>like a game of thrones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meat,</v>

2210
01:41:08.401 --> 01:41:09.910
<v Speaker 3>corn and kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

2211
01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:11.073
<v Speaker 3>that's what you're asking of you to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>or you see that's like the dream job </v>

2212
01:41:13.151 --> 01:41:14.890
<v Speaker 3>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like hell yeah,</v>

2213
01:41:14.891 --> 01:41:16.990
<v Speaker 3>I want to play with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That sounded like fun.</v>

2214
01:41:17.040 --> 01:41:17.873
<v Speaker 3>It will be epic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think those movies and those shows </v>

2215
01:41:21.191 --> 01:41:23.920
<v Speaker 3>when done correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when executed correctly,</v>

2216
01:41:23.950 --> 01:41:27.130
<v Speaker 3>are some of the most entertaining </v>
<v Speaker 3>compelling things,</v>

2217
01:41:27.250 --> 01:41:31.150
<v Speaker 3>whether it's game of thrones or Lord of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the rings or this is the Conan ones were</v>

2218
01:41:31.151 --> 01:41:34.180
<v Speaker 3>just an arnold did a great job and those</v>
<v Speaker 3>are fun.</v>

2219
01:41:34.181 --> 01:41:35.040
<v Speaker 3>But they're campy.</v>

2220
01:41:35.080 --> 01:41:35.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2221
01:41:35.830 --> 01:41:38.230
<v Speaker 3>I mean the first one was good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other ones were painful.</v>

2222
01:41:38.290 --> 01:41:41.620
<v Speaker 3>They were reading.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I represent Robert Howard's don't work.</v>

2223
01:41:41.700 --> 01:41:44.080
<v Speaker 3>Don't already,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Howard's work is still to this day.</v>

2224
01:41:44.081 --> 01:41:46.480
<v Speaker 3>Never really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>totally been captured.</v>

2225

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I yard at Amazon is going to be doing a </v>

<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2228
01:41:53.441 --> 01:41:54.970

<v Speaker 3>would have announced it.</v>

2231
01:41:59.170 --> 01:42:00.860
<v Speaker 3>I think they were just saying it seemed </v>

<v Speaker 3>Mains they are gonna try to stick to a </v>

2259
01:43:03.220 --> 01:43:04.210
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

2260
01:43:04.540 --> 01:43:07.080
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what it's called,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I know that people keep raving about</v>

2261
01:43:07.081 --> 01:43:08.450
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Aliah Goliath.</v>

2262
01:43:08.580 --> 01:43:09.820
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2263
01:43:09.850 --> 01:43:11.740
<v Speaker 3>It's supposed to be really good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2264
01:43:12.220 --> 01:43:15.520
<v Speaker 3>And you know the problem with those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's what's weird.</v>

2265
01:43:15.820 --> 01:43:18.970
<v Speaker 3>More than half the households in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>country have Amazon.</v>

2266
01:43:19.780 --> 01:43:21.240
<v Speaker 3>I think Amazon prime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

2267
01:43:21.380 --> 01:43:23.380
<v Speaker 3>Like right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like 51% of the households.</v>

2268
01:43:23.800 --> 01:43:27.370
<v Speaker 3>But how many people are actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>watching those Amazon videos?</v>

2269
01:43:27.730 --> 01:43:28.563
<v Speaker 3>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think once they start booking these </v>

2270
01:43:31.601 --> 01:43:33.610
<v Speaker 3>kind of money on some of these big </v>
<v Speaker 3>shows,</v>

2271
01:43:33.611 --> 01:43:35.640
<v Speaker 3>the odds that that percentage is going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to grow,</v>

2272
01:43:35.650 --> 01:43:37.810
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty damn high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's find out this,</v>

2273
01:43:37.811 --> 01:43:39.700
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if Amazon releases their </v>
<v Speaker 3>numbers.</v>

2274
01:43:40.240 --> 01:43:42.310
<v Speaker 3>They don't do they do it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably not.</v>

2275
01:43:42.340 --> 01:43:44.080
<v Speaker 3>But did they do it the same way?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't know.</v>

2276
01:43:44.290 --> 01:43:45.610
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Google,</v>

2277
01:43:45.640 --> 01:43:47.020
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see if,</v>

2278
01:43:47.080 --> 01:43:50.440
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many people watch Goliath on Amazon?</v>

2279
01:43:51.050 --> 01:43:51.883
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we'll find out because date no one</v>
<v Speaker 3>has any idea how many people are </v>

2280
01:43:55.011 --> 01:43:57.950
<v Speaker 3>watching things on netflix other than </v>
<v Speaker 3>Netflix and Netflix.</v>

2281
01:43:58.190 --> 01:43:59.023
<v Speaker 3>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't tell anybody nothing and </v>

2282
01:44:01.671 --> 01:44:06.230
<v Speaker 3>clearly must be a good number because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they keep producing shows booked of mine</v>

2283
01:44:06.231 --> 01:44:08.450
<v Speaker 3>in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know that it's working for them.</v>

2284
01:44:08.540 --> 01:44:09.373
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they do know is how many people </v>

2285
01:44:11.361 --> 01:44:14.450
<v Speaker 3>have subscribed to Netflix and that's an</v>
<v Speaker 3>insane,</v>

2286
01:44:14.540 --> 01:44:15.373
<v Speaker 3>huge number.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the actual number of people that </v>

2287
01:44:17.241 --> 01:44:18.710
<v Speaker 3>watch every,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't tell you shit.</v>

2288
01:44:18.711 --> 01:44:21.020
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a comedy special on Netflix.</v>

2289
01:44:21.021 --> 01:44:23.210
<v Speaker 3>They don't tell you nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They go,</v>

2290
01:44:23.240 --> 01:44:24.770
<v Speaker 3>great job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We like it.</v>

2291
01:44:25.670 --> 01:44:27.260
<v Speaker 3>You have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you like it.</v>

2292
01:44:27.261 --> 01:44:28.010
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2293
01:44:28.010 --> 01:44:29.390
<v Speaker 3>it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People love it.</v>

2294
01:44:29.720 --> 01:44:30.860
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well how many people love it?</v>

2295
01:44:30.890 --> 01:44:31.760
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lots.</v>

2296
01:44:33.680 --> 01:44:36.020
<v Speaker 3>No fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't give you any data,</v>

2297
01:44:36.590 --> 01:44:39.680
<v Speaker 3>which they don't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And maybe that's good.</v>

2298
01:44:39.950 --> 01:44:42.160
<v Speaker 3>Maybe people concentrate too much on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>numbers.</v>

2299
01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:43.033
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like someone was saying that the Oscars </v>

2300
01:44:45.051 --> 01:44:45.960
<v Speaker 3>this year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2301
01:44:46.110 --> 01:44:48.260
<v Speaker 3>the Oscars this year are down by you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

2302
01:44:48.261 --> 01:44:49.094
<v Speaker 3>5 million people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They still got washed by 25 million </v>

2303
01:44:51.381 --> 01:44:52.490
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause I'm like,</v>

2304
01:44:52.491 --> 01:44:54.110

2305
01:44:54.111 --> 01:44:55.700
<v Speaker 3>Like who cares?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is that even a thing?</v>

2306
01:44:55.880 --> 01:44:57.770
<v Speaker 3>Because that's why we've been </v>
<v Speaker 3>concentrating on that.</v>

2307
01:44:57.771 --> 01:44:58.604
<v Speaker 3>I can't find the viewers but they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the kind of information they </v>

2308
01:45:00.171 --> 01:45:01.004

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2311
01:45:08.960 --> 01:45:09.793
<v Speaker 3>No other season,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no other season one had a higher season </v>

2312
01:45:13.131 --> 01:45:16.220

2337
01:46:22.940 --> 01:46:24.920
<v Speaker 3>Like they took over blockbuster first </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they're like,</v>

2338
01:46:24.921 --> 01:46:26.540
<v Speaker 3>and now it's all streaming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2339
01:46:26.541 --> 01:46:30.200
<v Speaker 3>You can still get dvds I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know how many I do cause I'm</v>

2340
01:46:30.201 --> 01:46:32.300
<v Speaker 3>a nerd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get dvds still.</v>

2341
01:46:32.630 --> 01:46:33.463
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause they don't have the same </v>

2342
01:46:33.981 --> 01:46:34.814
<v Speaker 3>offerings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their staff that they do have on DVD </v>

2343
01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:39.200
<v Speaker 3>that they don't have on streaming and </v>
<v Speaker 3>vice versa.</v>

2344
01:46:39.590 --> 01:46:41.310
<v Speaker 3>So like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was I watching?</v>

2345
01:46:41.340 --> 01:46:42.500
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2346
01:46:43.310 --> 01:46:45.440
<v Speaker 3>I think at the last season of Vikings </v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

2347
01:46:45.441 --> 01:46:46.274
<v Speaker 3>I think that's why I fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been watching it now I'm season </v>

2348
01:46:49.591 --> 01:46:50.730

2349
01:46:50.760 --> 01:46:51.720
<v Speaker 3>That's the good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2350
01:46:51.750 --> 01:46:55.200
<v Speaker 3>it kind of don't tell me that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't tell me it goes down hill.</v>

2351
01:46:55.201 --> 01:46:57.210
<v Speaker 3>I'll fucking go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's two seasons are awesome,</v>

2352
01:46:57.280 --> 01:47:01.050
<v Speaker 3>son of a [inaudible] game of thrones </v>
<v Speaker 3>that way through Netflix for instance.</v>

2353
01:47:01.750 --> 01:47:02.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>You can rent the dvds of game of </v>

2355
01:47:04.591 --> 01:47:05.520
<v Speaker 3>thrones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exact shit,</v>

2356
01:47:05.820 --> 01:47:06.653
<v Speaker 3>punch it through their streaming app,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you could only get game of thrones </v>

2357
01:47:10.051 --> 01:47:10.710
<v Speaker 3>dvds.</v>

2358
01:47:10.710 --> 01:47:11.250
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2359
01:47:11.250 --> 01:47:12.600
<v Speaker 3>But you're paying the next year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what,</v>

2360
01:47:12.601 --> 01:47:14.810
<v Speaker 3>10 bucks a month to rent those and send </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2361
01:47:14.820 --> 01:47:16.500
<v Speaker 3>That's how they used,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what Netflix was when it started,</v>

2362
01:47:16.501 --> 01:47:17.191
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>

2363
01:47:17.191 --> 01:47:18.670
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three dvds a month or whenever.</v>

2364
01:47:18.671 --> 01:47:19.411
<v Speaker 3>We're at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Weird.</v>

2365
01:47:19.411 --> 01:47:20.244
<v Speaker 3>So netflix dvds has game of thrones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Netflix streaming does not exactly </v>

2366
01:47:24.180 --> 01:47:26.820
<v Speaker 3>everything for any DVD you can get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2367
01:47:27.270 --> 01:47:29.910
<v Speaker 3>that's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had a lot more on dvds.</v>

2368
01:47:29.911 --> 01:47:33.690
<v Speaker 3>Then they have just streaming there a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch of stuff that I want to watch like</v>

2369
01:47:34.160 --> 01:47:36.420
<v Speaker 3>case in point you have game of thrones </v>
<v Speaker 3>and Viking.</v>

2370
01:47:36.421 --> 01:47:37.254
<v Speaker 3>Some of that stuff is uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to freak out and not having a </v>

2371
01:47:39.961 --> 01:47:43.320
<v Speaker 3>physical DVD player in my laptop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this is ridiculous.</v>

2372
01:47:43.350 --> 01:47:45.420
<v Speaker 3>So I bought one of those ones that plugs</v>
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>

2373
01:47:45.460 --> 01:47:47.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never used it once.</v>

2374
01:47:47.440 --> 01:47:49.910
<v Speaker 3>Sat there is by are just in watching </v>
<v Speaker 3>Orleans stream,</v>

2375
01:47:49.911 --> 01:47:50.744
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>download them from itunes and then they </v>

2376
01:47:52.981 --> 01:47:53.850
<v Speaker 3>sit on my laptop.</v>

2377
01:47:53.850 --> 01:47:55.520
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2378
01:47:55.920 --> 01:47:56.753
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is all so new but yet we're so </v>

2379
01:48:01.230 --> 01:48:03.840
<v Speaker 3>convinced that this is what this is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>future,</v>

2380
01:48:03.860 --> 01:48:04.590
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is it.</v>

2381
01:48:04.590 --> 01:48:07.230
<v Speaker 3>Netflix period.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody else fuck off.</v>

2382
01:48:07.620 --> 01:48:11.160
<v Speaker 3>It's locked in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they're doing comedy specials on</v>

2383
01:48:11.161 --> 01:48:12.560
<v Speaker 3>Amazon as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2384
01:48:12.840 --> 01:48:13.673
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure Amazon prime did Bob </v>
<v Speaker 3>Saget new special and a few other </v>

2385
01:48:18.271 --> 01:48:19.104
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then that's one of the cool things </v>

2386
01:48:20.491 --> 01:48:22.720
<v Speaker 3>because Amazon is trying to compete with</v>
<v Speaker 3>Netflix,</v>

2387
01:48:22.721 --> 01:48:25.440
<v Speaker 3>so they are trying to come up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they're going to put an insane amount</v>

2388
01:48:25.441 --> 01:48:26.274
<v Speaker 3>of money and show his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's got eight for content because </v>

2389

<v Speaker 3>I would love to see a bunch of different</v>

2411
01:49:28.380 --> 01:49:33.180
<v Speaker 3>viable outlets for people to release </v>

2416
01:49:42.151 --> 01:49:42.984
<v Speaker 3>They're going to try to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Create original stuff that they have </v>

2429
01:50:12.150 --> 01:50:12.983
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think in terms of like your </v>

2430
01:50:14.621 --> 01:50:18.040
<v Speaker 3>ability to sit down and do absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking nothing and zone out for days,</v>

2431
01:50:18.370 --> 01:50:19.203
<v Speaker 3>there's never been a better time </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] there's so much stuff </v>

2432
01:50:21.131 --> 01:50:21.964
<v Speaker 3>available.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Apple is reportedly investing 1 billion </v>

2433
01:50:24.731 --> 01:50:27.460
<v Speaker 3>in original video content.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2434
01:50:27.730 --> 01:50:29.010
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

2435
01:50:29.020 --> 01:50:29.853
<v Speaker 3>so appellees add that to the mix and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's Gary v with a big old smile on </v>

2436
01:50:33.221 --> 01:50:33.680
<v Speaker 3>his face.</v>

2437
01:50:33.680 --> 01:50:35.890
<v Speaker 3>How does that Guy Sleep?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Talk does,</v>

2438
01:50:36.340 --> 01:50:37.173
<v Speaker 3>how's he?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where's he,</v>

2439
01:50:37.390 --> 01:50:40.630
<v Speaker 3>where's he at the time I'm pretty busy </v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's what that guy,</v>

2440
01:50:40.900 --> 01:50:41.733
<v Speaker 3>exactly what people ask about you is </v>
<v Speaker 3>like how does he manage to to like 72 </v>

2441
01:50:45.251 --> 01:50:49.300
<v Speaker 3>carriers in one and an old hunting and </v>
<v Speaker 3>workout and duties and that is like,</v>

2442
01:50:49.330 --> 01:50:50.163
<v Speaker 3>oh I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think human cloning or like really </v>

2443
01:50:51.820 --> 01:50:52.653
<v Speaker 3>three Joe Rogan's going around that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there are like you have downloaded your </v>

2444
01:50:55.961 --> 01:50:58.940
<v Speaker 3>consciousness in three d for baldies </v>
<v Speaker 3>were doing some of this stuff.</v>

2445
01:50:58.950 --> 01:51:02.230
<v Speaker 3>One of them would fuck up hardcore if I </v>
<v Speaker 3>did that.</v>

2446
01:51:02.231 --> 01:51:03.064
<v Speaker 3>Like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard enough to manage my insanity </v>

2447
01:51:05.471 --> 01:51:07.150
<v Speaker 3>with one life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five,</v>

2448
01:51:07.151 --> 01:51:07.984
<v Speaker 3>three lives going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of them are definitely go off the </v>

2449
01:51:09.521 --> 01:51:13.490
<v Speaker 3>rails with I think is what I do is it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>more of a,</v>

2450
01:51:13.870 --> 01:51:17.440
<v Speaker 3>it's an illusion that I'm as busy as </v>
<v Speaker 3>people think I am.</v>

2451
01:51:17.740 --> 01:51:20.530
<v Speaker 3>It's not as busy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is busy,</v>

2452
01:51:21.160 --> 01:51:26.160
<v Speaker 3>but it's less busy with work than people</v>
<v Speaker 3>think because the podcast is,</v>

2453
01:51:27.280 --> 01:51:28.113
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sitting here with a friend like you and </v>

2454
01:51:29.771 --> 01:51:31.810
<v Speaker 3>talk for a few hours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty easy.</v>

2455
01:51:32.050 --> 01:51:34.780
<v Speaker 3>That's not really that hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the working out,</v>

2456
01:51:34.781 --> 01:51:35.614
<v Speaker 3>well that's just mandatory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just have to go around and then there's </v>

2457
01:51:38.020 --> 01:51:38.853
<v Speaker 3>the standup comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's kind of a passion project </v>

2458
01:51:41.110 --> 01:51:44.020
<v Speaker 3>and it's interesting and I do it all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2459
01:51:44.021 --> 01:51:46.540
<v Speaker 3>Like I know avid timed down like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh hang out with my family,</v>

2460
01:51:46.541 --> 01:51:47.620
<v Speaker 3>tell my kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go to bed,</v>

2461
01:51:47.830 --> 01:51:49.120
<v Speaker 3>which is usually like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2462
01:51:49.150 --> 01:51:51.060
<v Speaker 3>eight ish and that's when I leave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2463
01:51:51.070 --> 01:51:51.903
<v Speaker 3>Then I go to the comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I know I've have it pretty much </v>

2464
01:51:54.581 --> 01:51:55.414
<v Speaker 3>locked in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get my podcast done before the kids </v>

2465
01:51:57.641 --> 01:52:00.250
<v Speaker 3>get home from school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm hanging out with them.</v>

2466
01:52:00.360 --> 01:52:02.110
<v Speaker 3>I know how to do it.</v>

2467
01:52:02.140 --> 01:52:05.230
<v Speaker 3>I'm working out while they're at school </v>
<v Speaker 3>for the most part.</v>

2468
01:52:05.530 --> 01:52:08.130
<v Speaker 3>But it impressive though because that </v>
<v Speaker 3>means you have cause you every,</v>

2469
01:52:08.131 --> 01:52:08.964
<v Speaker 3>at least until you do have so much stuff</v>
<v Speaker 3>on your plate and the way you make it </v>

2470
01:52:12.011 --> 01:52:12.844
<v Speaker 3>flow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's that something in terms of time </v>

2471
01:52:15.341 --> 01:52:16.174
<v Speaker 3>management,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there will be people willing to </v>

2472
01:52:17.291 --> 01:52:18.124
<v Speaker 3>take courses from you on how to put it </v>
<v Speaker 3>all together because that's a skill </v>

2473
01:52:20.501 --> 01:52:21.334
<v Speaker 3>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to be really steadfast in what </v>

2474
01:52:25.061 --> 01:52:26.590
<v Speaker 3>you want to do and what you don't want </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do.</v>

2475
01:52:26.770 --> 01:52:29.110
<v Speaker 3>And when you don't want to do something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just don't do it right.</v>

2476
01:52:29.230 --> 01:52:30.063
<v Speaker 3>But that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't able to do this until I really </v>

2477
01:52:31.331 --> 01:52:32.164
<v Speaker 3>started working for myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like working for myself and the ability </v>

2478
01:52:35.261 --> 01:52:36.094
<v Speaker 3>to wait.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you have a bunch of different jobs </v>

2479
01:52:37.811 --> 01:52:40.120
<v Speaker 3>but you're beholden to other people's </v>
<v Speaker 3>schedules,</v>

2480
01:52:40.121 --> 01:52:41.240
<v Speaker 3>it's almost on manager.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2481
01:52:41.500 --> 01:52:43.480
<v Speaker 3>It's up and you can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

2482
01:52:43.481 --> 01:52:44.314
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why I would assume I'm trying to </v>

2483
01:52:45.050 --> 01:52:45.770
<v Speaker 3>do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to,</v>

2484
01:52:45.770 --> 01:52:46.130
<v Speaker 3>as much</v>

2485
01:52:46.130 --> 01:52:46.963
<v Speaker 1>as I enjoy being in the classroom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to be in the classroom with </v>

2486
01:52:48.791 --> 01:52:49.624
<v Speaker 1>less and less,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just do more online and do more Paul </v>

2487
01:52:51.840 --> 01:52:54.520
<v Speaker 1>customer because I'm tired of being in </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody else's,</v>

2488
01:52:54.700 --> 01:52:57.140
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if you like driving.</v>

2489
01:52:57.141 --> 01:52:59.780
<v Speaker 1>It's like I don't mind if you put me in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the classroom and that's great,</v>

2490
01:52:59.781 --> 01:53:00.614
<v Speaker 1>but if I have to drive an hour and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>half to get there and then be stuck in </v>

2491
01:53:02.901 --> 01:53:04.190
<v Speaker 1>traffic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like fuck this.</v>

2492
01:53:04.191 --> 01:53:07.130
<v Speaker 1>This is just not fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel like there's opportunities,</v>

2493
01:53:07.131 --> 01:53:10.970
<v Speaker 1>like real viable opportunities for </v>
<v Speaker 1>people now to get an education online?</v>

2494
01:53:11.530 --> 01:53:14.300
<v Speaker 1>Legitimate full education?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely a merchant.</v>

2495
01:53:14.301 --> 01:53:18.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think it's a part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem is that the universities kind of</v>

2496
01:53:18.831 --> 01:53:19.664
<v Speaker 1>have a monopoly on the diplomas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is something that people need for </v>

2497
01:53:22.881 --> 01:53:25.700
<v Speaker 1>their job is not the day choose who I </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to be educated.</v>

2498
01:53:25.730 --> 01:53:26.563
<v Speaker 1>There are ways to do it is also they </v>
<v Speaker 1>need that piece of paper and of course </v>

2499
01:53:29.631 --> 01:53:32.120
<v Speaker 1>so far only the official universities </v>
<v Speaker 1>have that.</v>

2500
01:53:32.420 --> 01:53:33.500
<v Speaker 1>But otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2501
01:53:33.501 --> 01:53:35.090
<v Speaker 1>there are a bunch of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like,</v>

2502

<v Speaker 1>cause he asked me to do these about the </v>

2511
01:53:53.301 --> 01:53:55.340
<v Speaker 1>history of martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>phd to teach.</v>

2517
01:54:07.040 --> 01:54:07.873
<v Speaker 1>And I was like white guy going into an </v>
<v Speaker 1>Asian American studies department and </v>

2518
01:54:11.530 --> 01:54:12.770

<v Speaker 1>I'm not Asian American and I do all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nma and uh,</v>

2521
01:54:18.800 --> 01:54:20.960
<v Speaker 1>I never taken a course in Asian American</v>

<v Speaker 1>but I would love to teach for you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>dee rees why?</v>

2523
01:54:23.240 --> 01:54:24.073
<v Speaker 1>And by the time I was done with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>peach about history and philosophy of </v>

2524
01:54:26.090 --> 01:54:27.230
<v Speaker 1>martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were like,</v>

2525
01:54:27.440 --> 01:54:28.490
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a hired,</v>

2526
01:54:28.580 --> 01:54:30.620

<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

2527
01:54:30.621 --> 01:54:31.970
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now why would they,</v>

2528
01:54:32.030 --> 01:54:35.330
<v Speaker 1>would they want you to be Asian because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you teaching about an agent subject.</v>

2529
01:54:35.360 --> 01:54:36.193
<v Speaker 1>I mean they don't want you to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it kind of works their way because of </v>

2530
01:54:38.931 --> 01:54:39.764
<v Speaker 1>the way you know most of the people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>stopped taking a bunch of classes in </v>

2531
01:54:43.010 --> 01:54:43.843
<v Speaker 1>ethnic studies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually people who are from that </v>

2532
01:54:45.201 --> 01:54:48.050
<v Speaker 1>particular ethnic group you've had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of,</v>

2533
01:54:49.010 --> 01:54:50.660
<v Speaker 1>people always look at me like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh,</v>

2534
01:54:50.690 --> 01:54:53.300
<v Speaker 1>what's going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I do teach in an American Indian</v>

2535
01:54:53.301 --> 01:54:54.134
<v Speaker 1>studies department.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have taught in an Asian American </v>

2536
01:54:55.821 --> 01:54:58.790
<v Speaker 1>studies department,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you look at everybody else,</v>

2537
01:54:58.791 --> 01:54:59.624
<v Speaker 1>usually they are people who are from </v>
<v Speaker 1>that particular ethnic group who are </v>

2538
01:55:01.881 --> 01:55:06.320
<v Speaker 1>passionate and to dig in that much to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that field.</v>

2539
01:55:06.590 --> 01:55:07.700
<v Speaker 1>Is there a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that an issue?</v>

2540
01:55:07.701 --> 01:55:09.320
<v Speaker 1>Is there like push back?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're not,</v>

2541
01:55:09.470 --> 01:55:11.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's kind of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be fair,</v>

2542
01:55:11.811 --> 01:55:12.644
<v Speaker 1>people have been really cool about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I mean I've even had the </v>

2543
01:55:14.781 --> 01:55:15.614
<v Speaker 1>situation where I taught as pirate of an</v>
<v Speaker 1>ethnic ethnic studies class where they </v>

2544
01:55:18.841 --> 01:55:20.090
<v Speaker 1>were like four people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2545
01:55:20.091 --> 01:55:20.924
<v Speaker 1>And there's the African American studies</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys and African American guy in the </v>

2546
01:55:24.051 --> 01:55:24.801
<v Speaker 1>Chicano,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Latino,</v>

2547
01:55:24.801 --> 01:55:25.634
<v Speaker 1>Chicano,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Latino.</v>

2548
01:55:25.870 --> 01:55:28.160
<v Speaker 1>And that was the odd one out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2549
01:55:28.161 --> 01:55:30.860
<v Speaker 1>I was teaching the American Indian </v>
<v Speaker 1>studies section and they're like,</v>

2550
01:55:30.861 --> 01:55:32.780
<v Speaker 1>Huh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just replaced my friend,</v>

2551
01:55:32.781 --> 01:55:36.860
<v Speaker 1>the native lady who the fuck are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>White guy kind of thing.</v>

2552
01:55:37.580 --> 01:55:40.160
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing was they want to check you.</v>

2553
01:55:40.220 --> 01:55:42.770
<v Speaker 1>And then once I did my thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first few licensed,</v>

2554
01:55:42.771 --> 01:55:43.650
<v Speaker 1>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

2555
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:45.000
<v Speaker 1>he's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We like him,</v>

2556
01:55:45.120 --> 01:55:45.953
<v Speaker 1>it's all good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there was no bullshit and like </v>

2557
01:55:47.851 --> 01:55:50.550
<v Speaker 1>I would have expected to run into a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>more pushback.</v>

2558
01:55:50.780 --> 01:55:53.850
<v Speaker 1>There really wasn't one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in your favor about when it comes to</v>

2559
01:55:53.851 --> 01:55:56.940
<v Speaker 1>martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it is mostly Asian in origin,</v>

2560
01:55:56.970 --> 01:55:59.610
<v Speaker 1>it varies so widely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These Chinese marshawn,</v>

2561
01:55:59.640 --> 01:56:01.170
<v Speaker 1>Japanese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Korean,</v>

2562
01:56:01.560 --> 01:56:05.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean it goes on and on tie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so many different styles.</v>

2563
01:56:06.330 --> 01:56:10.440
<v Speaker 1>And then of course South America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once Brazilian Jujitsu got into the mix.</v>

2564
01:56:10.500 --> 01:56:11.333
<v Speaker 1>Of course they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion have revolutionized </v>

2565
01:56:13.591 --> 01:56:14.424
<v Speaker 1>martial arts more than any other group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that one part of the country in </v>

2566
01:56:18.271 --> 01:56:19.410
<v Speaker 1>South America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brazil,</v>

2567
01:56:19.860 --> 01:56:20.693
<v Speaker 1>they had more of an impact on martial </v>
<v Speaker 1>arts I think than anyway because they </v>

2568
01:56:23.851 --> 01:56:24.684
<v Speaker 1>essentially started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they started the ultimate </v>

2569
01:56:28.141 --> 01:56:31.530
<v Speaker 1>fighting championship just to see if </v>
<v Speaker 1>their martial art was superior.</v>

2570
01:56:31.550 --> 01:56:32.383
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they proved it to be so it's at </v>

2571
01:56:33.391 --> 01:56:37.290
<v Speaker 1>least on its own by itself at first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2572
01:56:37.320 --> 01:56:40.620
<v Speaker 1>before anybody knew about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that stuff was a,</v>

2573
01:56:40.680 --> 01:56:44.130
<v Speaker 1>there's the whole period from when </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japanese martial arts,</v>

2574
01:56:44.131 --> 01:56:47.910
<v Speaker 1>we're kind of crashing because nobody </v>
<v Speaker 1>was dressing as a Samurai anymore,</v>

2575
01:56:47.911 --> 01:56:48.744
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing that stuff didn't make sense </v>

2576
01:56:49.771 --> 01:56:50.250
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

2577
01:56:50.250 --> 01:56:51.083
<v Speaker 1>And Jiu Jitsu was seen kind of as low </v>
<v Speaker 1>class activity for gain stairs and you </v>

2578
01:56:54.891 --> 01:56:55.724
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was less and less popularity for </v>

2579
01:56:57.211 --> 01:56:59.540
<v Speaker 1>that field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when did you go to Oakano?</v>

2580
01:56:59.550 --> 01:57:03.270
<v Speaker 1>The creator of judo started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was these nerdy shopper class guy,</v>

2581
01:57:03.271 --> 01:57:04.104
<v Speaker 1>but he was very passionate about judo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So He transformed the Jujitsu Cori into </v>

2582
01:57:07.800 --> 01:57:10.380
<v Speaker 1>judo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gave it to a whole new spin.</v>

2583
01:57:10.381 --> 01:57:10.891
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2584
01:57:10.891 --> 01:57:11.724
<v Speaker 1>it's not this thing to beat people up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like all the tags you have seen so far </v>

2585
01:57:14.581 --> 01:57:16.830
<v Speaker 1>where using jude was a form of </v>
<v Speaker 1>education.</v>

2586
01:57:16.980 --> 01:57:18.390
<v Speaker 1>And then we started that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2587
01:57:18.391 --> 01:57:19.224
<v Speaker 1>it's a super cool story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he starts sending people all </v>

2588
01:57:21.181 --> 01:57:22.014
<v Speaker 1>over the world to spread it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they go to Russia and then mix </v>

2589
01:57:24.601 --> 01:57:25.434
<v Speaker 1>with Rashaun thing and they create sound</v>
<v Speaker 1>sambo and then come out here and then </v>

2590
01:57:28.351 --> 01:57:29.184
<v Speaker 1>with a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu when my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that goes down to Brazil and all of </v>

2591
01:57:31.801 --> 01:57:31.980
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2592
01:57:31.980 --> 01:57:35.250
<v Speaker 1>So it's like that whole story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how it's beans is awesome.</v>

2593
01:57:35.251 --> 01:57:38.250
<v Speaker 1>And then you end up with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the joy of globalization where like when</v>

2594
01:57:38.251 --> 01:57:41.100
<v Speaker 1>you see like hallways going to fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>against Sakuraba and you have,</v>

2595
01:57:41.670 --> 01:57:44.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as Elian Dude trained in,</v>

2596
01:57:44.810 --> 01:57:45.643
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what originally was a Asia martial arts </v>

2597
01:57:47.311 --> 01:57:50.430
<v Speaker 1>transformed into this Brazilian thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>wearing ag,</v>

2598
01:57:50.730 --> 01:57:54.870
<v Speaker 1>going against getting who was more of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>catch wrestler with studied more through</v>

2599
01:57:54.871 --> 01:57:57.530
<v Speaker 1>western wrestling a whole lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes hilarious.</v>

2600
01:57:57.540 --> 01:58:00.400
<v Speaker 1>It's like you have the Japanese guy who </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a more western wrestling back.</v>

2601
01:58:01.470 --> 01:58:03.360
<v Speaker 1>It's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is crazy.</v>

2602
01:58:03.510 --> 01:58:08.310
<v Speaker 1>The Japanese especially Sakuraba we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>way influenced by catch wrestling,</v>

2603
01:58:08.670 --> 01:58:11.040
<v Speaker 1>but which is American folk style </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestling.</v>

2604
01:58:11.130 --> 01:58:11.963
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

2605
01:58:12.360 --> 01:58:14.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I didn't know that,</v>

2606
01:58:14.600 --> 01:58:17.160
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Jujitsu was used by thugs.</v>

2607
01:58:17.220 --> 01:58:18.053
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the pirates that he's in </v>

2608
01:58:19.880 --> 01:58:20.713
<v Speaker 1>Hawaii,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Japan bashing him polarities because </v>

2609
01:58:22.470 --> 01:58:25.310
<v Speaker 1>used to be sort of the Samurai arts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2610
01:58:25.320 --> 01:58:27.750
<v Speaker 1>You do all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then the summer I end that,</v>

2611
01:58:27.751 --> 01:58:30.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the 1870s or so,</v>

2612
01:58:30.571 --> 01:58:31.404
<v Speaker 1>that was the pulse of the summarize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there really wasn't a function for </v>

2613
01:58:33.901 --> 01:58:34.980
<v Speaker 1>this stuff anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2614
01:58:35.340 --> 01:58:36.173
<v Speaker 1>and the only people who trained were </v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly against theirs and kind of rough </v>

2615
01:58:38.971 --> 01:58:39.804
<v Speaker 1>guys who train for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they got into fights on the </v>

2616
01:58:41.951 --> 01:58:44.230
<v Speaker 1>street and then kind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2617
01:58:44.231 --> 01:58:46.360
<v Speaker 1>because he was this kind of secretly </v>
<v Speaker 1>child.</v>

2618
01:58:46.361 --> 01:58:49.720
<v Speaker 1>They Puti mean to strain in Jiu Jitsu to</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of build the map.</v>

2619
01:58:49.780 --> 01:58:52.900
<v Speaker 1>Giving me some strand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any was a complete nerd,</v>

2620
01:58:52.930 --> 01:58:55.300
<v Speaker 1>but he loved Jujitsu and so he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2621
01:58:55.301 --> 01:58:55.750
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2622
01:58:55.750 --> 01:58:58.750
<v Speaker 1>don't put it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a great heart for other reason.</v>

2623
01:58:59.080 --> 01:59:04.080
<v Speaker 1>And he had his old way of spinning it </v>
<v Speaker 1>around to saying that was the old stuff.</v>

2624
01:59:04.690 --> 01:59:06.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To beat people up.</v>

2625
01:59:06.221 --> 01:59:10.180
<v Speaker 1>What we do today is a form of education </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a relationship with your body.</v>

2626
01:59:10.450 --> 01:59:13.060
<v Speaker 1>Any bicycle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He invented a new function for it.</v>

2627
01:59:13.090 --> 01:59:15.640
<v Speaker 1>So the Japanese society went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>

2628
01:59:15.641 --> 01:59:18.460
<v Speaker 1>we can still do that stuff and now </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a better reason for it.</v>

2629
01:59:18.490 --> 01:59:19.323
<v Speaker 1>That's 15 the times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not the same reason why we would </v>

2630
01:59:22.451 --> 01:59:23.284
<v Speaker 1>train in the 17 hundreds right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These actually fit the context of our </v>

2631
01:59:26.471 --> 01:59:27.304
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2632
01:59:27.340 --> 01:59:31.960
<v Speaker 1>Let's the judo and then do they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>texts where you could see the techniques</v>

2633
01:59:31.990 --> 01:59:33.970
<v Speaker 1>or where you could see what </v>
<v Speaker 1>similarities?</v>

2634
01:59:34.060 --> 01:59:34.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2635
01:59:34.720 --> 01:59:37.540
<v Speaker 1>There are both English in Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Manuel's where there are,</v>

2636
01:59:37.541 --> 01:59:39.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the drawings and stuff like that.</v>

2637
01:59:39.311 --> 01:59:40.144
<v Speaker 1>And then by the time of comes around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they even start diving fruitage after a </v>

2638
01:59:43.181 --> 01:59:44.030
<v Speaker 1>while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2639
01:59:44.530 --> 01:59:47.370
<v Speaker 1>Footage of actual films of you </v>
<v Speaker 1>utilization that they,</v>

2640
01:59:47.380 --> 01:59:48.213
<v Speaker 1>lord drills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They look goofy as hell because they're </v>

2641
01:59:49.450 --> 01:59:51.790
<v Speaker 1>sped up and the move from the and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they,</v>

2642
01:59:51.791 --> 01:59:52.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2643
01:59:52.210 --> 01:59:55.750
<v Speaker 1>there's good stuff and some of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys are just bad asses from day one.</v>

2644
01:59:55.750 --> 01:59:56.583
<v Speaker 1>I mean some of the old judo guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got the reputation for just being </v>

2645
01:59:58.991 --> 01:59:59.824
<v Speaker 1>killers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2646
01:59:59.830 --> 02:00:00.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well for sure.</v>

2647
02:00:00.681 --> 02:00:01.790
<v Speaker 1>Judo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

2648
02:00:01.800 --> 02:00:06.520
<v Speaker 1>I wonder how much Jujitsu has changed </v>
<v Speaker 1>since then to now because obviously um,</v>

2649
02:00:06.620 --> 02:00:08.800
<v Speaker 1>and putting so much emphasis on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ground,</v>

2650
02:00:08.801 --> 02:00:09.634
<v Speaker 1>the Brazilians really refined all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>submission techniques to a razor sharp </v>

2651
02:00:12.581 --> 02:00:17.560
<v Speaker 1>edge and really changed a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>original setups and the way people enter</v>

2652
02:00:17.561 --> 02:00:20.110
<v Speaker 1>into submissions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would love to see what it used to look</v>

2653
02:00:20.111 --> 02:00:22.150
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even that's funny because if you look at</v>

2654
02:00:22.151 --> 02:00:24.080
<v Speaker 1>like some old judo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like causing judo,</v>

2655
02:00:24.160 --> 02:00:24.993
<v Speaker 1>where they have is very ground oriented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those guys do leg locks where it's like </v>

2656
02:00:28.781 --> 02:00:33.460
<v Speaker 1>you see these Japanese guys from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>1920s like lock in each other and you're</v>

2657
02:00:33.461 --> 02:00:34.540
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

2658
02:00:34.541 --> 02:00:36.340
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the stuff that today's hot,</v>

2659
02:00:36.430 --> 02:00:39.250
<v Speaker 1>some of these guys were doing and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably wasn't as refined,</v>

2660
02:00:39.251 --> 02:00:40.960
<v Speaker 1>but it was like men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they weren't doing it.</v>

2661
02:00:41.040 --> 02:00:44.500
<v Speaker 1>That's catch wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Catch wrestling was all about leg locks.</v>

2662
02:00:44.890 --> 02:00:47.640
<v Speaker 1>They were leg locking when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2663
02:00:47.730 --> 02:00:50.800
<v Speaker 1>the Americans were really into Brazilian</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu and stuff.</v>

2664
02:00:51.100 --> 02:00:52.150
<v Speaker 1>Is this,</v>

<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2675
02:01:17.380 --> 02:01:18.910
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the other one,</v>

2676
02:01:18.911 --> 02:01:19.744
<v Speaker 1>it looks like he's got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like it's setting up a full </v>

2677
02:01:21.941 --> 02:01:22.540
<v Speaker 1>Nelson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2678
02:01:22.540 --> 02:01:23.373
<v Speaker 1>He has a half an less on one side and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got an under hook and the other </v>

2679
02:01:25.661 --> 02:01:26.494
<v Speaker 1>side of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2680
02:01:27.230 --> 02:01:30.730
<v Speaker 1>but I'm really going to spin around and </v>
<v Speaker 1>slam him right on his face.</v>

2681
02:01:30.730 --> 02:01:32.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>

2682
02:01:32.530 --> 02:01:34.090
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they have,</v>

2683
02:01:34.120 --> 02:01:34.953
<v Speaker 1>you get to look at it and these images </v>
<v Speaker 1>or they were just trying to figure out </v>

2684
02:01:38.500 --> 02:01:40.490
<v Speaker 1>like what's the best way to manipulate </v>
<v Speaker 1>the body.</v>

2685
02:01:41.180 --> 02:01:43.940
<v Speaker 1>It's just amazing to me how much of it </v>
<v Speaker 1>came from Japan.</v>

2686
02:01:43.970 --> 02:01:45.230
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean Japan,</v>

2687
02:01:45.920 --> 02:01:50.420
<v Speaker 1>so many interesting techniques and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>one area,</v>

2688
02:01:50.570 --> 02:01:51.403
<v Speaker 1>it was so vital and so important when it</v>
<v Speaker 1>came to the development of martial arts </v>

2689
02:01:57.070 --> 02:01:58.250
<v Speaker 1>in Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that weird?</v>

2690
02:01:58.280 --> 02:01:59.113
<v Speaker 1>Like a distillery story between China </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Japan is very similar to ancient </v>

2691
02:02:02.031 --> 02:02:03.950
<v Speaker 1>Greece and ancient Rome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2692
02:02:03.980 --> 02:02:06.680
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the developments came from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Greece.</v>

2693
02:02:06.681 --> 02:02:08.390
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the developments came from </v>
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>

2694
02:02:08.840 --> 02:02:09.673
<v Speaker 1>but then both the Roman and the Japanese</v>
<v Speaker 1>took those ideas and then ran with it </v>

2695
02:02:13.191 --> 02:02:14.024
<v Speaker 1>and systematize them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gave them a lot more of a structure or </v>

2696
02:02:16.341 --> 02:02:17.174
<v Speaker 1>gave them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>made them way easier to learn and to </v>

2697
02:02:18.531 --> 02:02:21.380
<v Speaker 1>teach and then popularize them as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>result.</v>

2698
02:02:21.380 --> 02:02:22.160
<v Speaker 1>And it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep,</v>

2699
02:02:22.160 --> 02:02:24.090
<v Speaker 1>now this stuff works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot easier to,</v>

2700
02:02:24.160 --> 02:02:26.180
<v Speaker 1>to that they brought it to other </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>

2701
02:02:27.440 --> 02:02:29.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was part of vision.</v>

2702
02:02:29.090 --> 02:02:33.140
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] was not a nationalist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did not have these Japan,</v>

2703
02:02:33.170 --> 02:02:34.340
<v Speaker 1>fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody else.</v>

2704
02:02:34.341 --> 02:02:38.090
<v Speaker 1>He had this idea of like you need is </v>
<v Speaker 1>universal brotherhood of mankind,</v>

2705
02:02:38.091 --> 02:02:41.410
<v Speaker 1>so we need to bring our staff so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody can benefit from it.</v>

2706
02:02:41.411 --> 02:02:43.370
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so he said,</v>

2707
02:02:43.371 --> 02:02:44.930
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's on people over door.</v>

2708
02:02:45.140 --> 02:02:45.973
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was even an idea that followed </v>

2709
02:02:47.420 --> 02:02:49.670
<v Speaker 1>because he did a three part series on in</v>
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>

2710
02:02:49.671 --> 02:02:50.504
<v Speaker 1>on fire about till the Roosevelt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he was just such a crazy </v>

2711
02:02:52.821 --> 02:02:53.660
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2712
02:02:53.661 --> 02:02:54.181
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2713
02:02:54.181 --> 02:02:55.400
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe come precedent.</v>

2714
02:02:55.401 --> 02:02:56.234
<v Speaker 1>That's the wildest dude out there and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>even like 1905 nine somewhere right </v>

2715
02:03:01.791 --> 02:03:02.624
<v Speaker 1>around there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a guy sent by Cano that taught </v>

2716
02:03:06.140 --> 02:03:09.860
<v Speaker 1>judo to the United States precedent and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was,</v>

2717
02:03:09.861 --> 02:03:10.694
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was one of the very first Americans </v>

2718
02:03:11.800 --> 02:03:13.670
<v Speaker 1>ever to to learn some Judah.</v>

2719
02:03:14.570 --> 02:03:16.040
<v Speaker 1>He was such an important precedent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

2720
02:03:16.070 --> 02:03:16.903
<v Speaker 1>If it wasn't for him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we wouldn't have the national public </v>

2721
02:03:17.751 --> 02:03:19.610
<v Speaker 1>lands we have to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was awesome.</v>

2722
02:03:19.850 --> 02:03:20.661
<v Speaker 1>He's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2723
02:03:20.661 --> 02:03:22.700
<v Speaker 1>I generally speaking when you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about us,</v>

2724
02:03:22.701 --> 02:03:26.300
<v Speaker 1>but I sit in is like different degrees </v>
<v Speaker 1>of what I don't like.</v>

2725
02:03:26.360 --> 02:03:26.811
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2726
02:03:26.811 --> 02:03:28.850
<v Speaker 1>I hate this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mildly hate this guy.</v>

2727
02:03:28.851 --> 02:03:32.480
<v Speaker 1>I'd really hate this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Total result was one of those dudes who,</v>

2728
02:03:32.481 --> 02:03:33.314
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's some stuff that he did </v>

2729
02:03:35.001 --> 02:03:36.560
<v Speaker 1>then say they are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit.</v>

2730
02:03:36.561 --> 02:03:39.890
<v Speaker 1>Okay that it wasn't so good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so much of it is awesome.</v>

2731
02:03:40.120 --> 02:03:42.170
<v Speaker 1>What did he say that you don't like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2732
02:03:42.200 --> 02:03:46.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean you got to give him a pass for </v>
<v Speaker 1>when he leaves,</v>

2733
02:03:46.790 --> 02:03:48.140
<v Speaker 1>but he of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2734
02:03:48.141 --> 02:03:48.974
<v Speaker 1>his idea about race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>copper to what we would consider a cool </v>

2735
02:03:50.961 --> 02:03:51.661
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2736
02:03:51.661 --> 02:03:54.350
<v Speaker 1>Not the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had some pretty heavyweight.</v>

2737
02:03:54.530 --> 02:03:56.670
<v Speaker 1>He started a lot more racist than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>end that,</v>

2738
02:03:56.671 --> 02:03:59.410
<v Speaker 1>so I also giving credit for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For being adaptive.</v>

2739
02:03:59.440 --> 02:04:00.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very adoptable.</v>

2740
02:04:00.801 --> 02:04:01.634
<v Speaker 1>Then cooling direct guard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But clearly some of his writings was </v>

2741
02:04:03.471 --> 02:04:04.304
<v Speaker 1>pretty freaky and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also he's one of the guy who just </v>

2742
02:04:06.201 --> 02:04:08.210
<v Speaker 1>never swear war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't like,</v>

2743
02:04:08.240 --> 02:04:09.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

2744
02:04:09.430 --> 02:04:11.600
<v Speaker 1>or yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>venture.</v>

2745
02:04:11.601 --> 02:04:12.434
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2746
02:04:12.440 --> 02:04:15.440
<v Speaker 1>The Art of Jujitsu is worth more in </v>
<v Speaker 1>every way.</v>

2747
02:04:15.441 --> 02:04:16.274
<v Speaker 1>Then all of our athletics combined,</v>
<v Speaker 1>President Theodore Roosevelt 1905 I </v>

2748
02:04:20.451 --> 02:04:21.560
<v Speaker 1>agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

2749
02:04:21.980 --> 02:04:24.830
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Me and Teddy Roosevelt,</v>

2750
02:04:25.340 --> 02:04:26.750
<v Speaker 1>same page.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

2751
02:04:27.090 --> 02:04:27.923
<v Speaker 1>You even seem like he lost sight in one </v>
<v Speaker 1>eye while he was president because of </v>

2752
02:04:31.521 --> 02:04:32.540
<v Speaker 1>sparring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Too hard.</v>

2753
02:04:32.930 --> 02:04:35.900
<v Speaker 1>Really go heat way to hire because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>barks all the time.</v>

2754
02:04:35.901 --> 02:04:36.734
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he goes,</v>

2755
02:04:36.740 --> 02:04:38.010
<v Speaker 1>he last division.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

2756
02:04:38.100 --> 02:04:39.840
<v Speaker 1>He lost vision in one eye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody's thumb.</v>

2757
02:04:39.841 --> 02:04:44.820
<v Speaker 1>The president probably mother fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2758
02:04:45.150 --> 02:04:48.090
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's gangster as president until a lot</v>

2759
02:04:48.091 --> 02:04:49.080
<v Speaker 1>of big game hunting too.</v>

2760
02:04:49.080 --> 02:04:50.310
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy went all over the world.</v>

2761
02:04:50.670 --> 02:04:53.910
<v Speaker 1>He did wild guy really when you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

2762
02:04:53.970 --> 02:04:56.960
<v Speaker 1>But my favorite ever was about a story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Speaking of bad ass is a,</v>

2763
02:04:57.030 --> 02:04:57.863
<v Speaker 1>in 1912 he's running for president again</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a third party candidate out of which </v>

2764
02:05:01.421 --> 02:05:02.900
<v Speaker 1>was cool in itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2765
02:05:02.910 --> 02:05:05.610
<v Speaker 1>Because he was challenging both the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Republican and Democrats.</v>

2766
02:05:06.420 --> 02:05:07.253
<v Speaker 1>He is in his car waving to the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>and somebody shooting for just a few </v>

2767
02:05:11.730 --> 02:05:13.410
<v Speaker 1>feet away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just straight in his chest.</v>

2768
02:05:14.010 --> 02:05:17.220
<v Speaker 1>But at the time he had these a 50 page </v>
<v Speaker 1>of speech,</v>

2769
02:05:17.221 --> 02:05:18.054
<v Speaker 1>he had better pay or to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he had all the written notes in his </v>

2770
02:05:19.771 --> 02:05:21.990
<v Speaker 1>pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had his glass case in his pocket.</v>

2771
02:05:21.991 --> 02:05:25.530
<v Speaker 1>So the bullet did hit him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was low down by going through the</v>

2772
02:05:25.531 --> 02:05:27.200
<v Speaker 1>glass case and the speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2773
02:05:28.050 --> 02:05:30.030
<v Speaker 1>but still you just took a bullet to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>chest,</v>

2774
02:05:30.031 --> 02:05:31.230
<v Speaker 1>you're bleeding and stuff.</v>

2775
02:05:31.230 --> 02:05:32.580
<v Speaker 1>And so everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

2776
02:05:32.581 --> 02:05:35.470
<v Speaker 1>we need to take him to the hospital and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Roosevelt coffee,</v>

2777
02:05:35.471 --> 02:05:36.304
<v Speaker 1>any sand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said that there's no blood coming </v>

2778
02:05:37.621 --> 02:05:38.191
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he said,</v>

2779
02:05:38.191 --> 02:05:39.350
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my lungs are in tough.</v>

2780
02:05:39.390 --> 02:05:41.850
<v Speaker 1>They haven't been pierced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what are you talking about hospital?</v>

2781
02:05:41.851 --> 02:05:44.490
<v Speaker 1>I got a speech to give,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he shows up,</v>

2782
02:05:45.030 --> 02:05:48.270
<v Speaker 1>we tee shirt covered in blood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he goes like,</v>

2783
02:05:48.300 --> 02:05:49.950
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm ladies and gentlemen.</v>

2784
02:05:49.980 --> 02:05:50.813
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you know I've been shot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it takes more than these two Kilo </v>

2785
02:05:54.960 --> 02:05:59.300
<v Speaker 1>Bull Moose and then deliver 90 minute </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech before several of his attendance.</v>

2786
02:05:59.310 --> 02:06:00.000
<v Speaker 1>Fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

2787
02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.730
<v Speaker 1>can we now go to the hospital please?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

2788
02:06:02.731 --> 02:06:03.330
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

2789
02:06:03.330 --> 02:06:05.610
<v Speaker 1>Now we can go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was the hospital back then?</v>

2790
02:06:05.730 --> 02:06:06.563
<v Speaker 1>You'd probably be better off not going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to rub the dead chicken on your whole </v>

2791
02:06:11.190 --> 02:06:12.023
<v Speaker 1>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What could they possibly do to fix that </v>

2792
02:06:13.681 --> 02:06:14.514
<v Speaker 1>back then?</v>

2793
02:06:15.050 --> 02:06:16.170
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2794
02:06:16.770 --> 02:06:18.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean hard times,</v>

2795
02:06:18.540 --> 02:06:19.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hard times,</v>

2796
02:06:19.441 --> 02:06:20.274
<v Speaker 1>great hard men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>soft times create a lot of the weak </v>

2797
02:06:23.131 --> 02:06:26.220
<v Speaker 1>bitches we're seeing flopping around our</v>
<v Speaker 1>streets today.</v>

2798
02:06:26.330 --> 02:06:30.060
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Roosevelt Hammer song over and over.</v>

2799
02:06:30.080 --> 02:06:32.090
<v Speaker 1>He had this whole idea of the strenuous </v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

2800
02:06:32.130 --> 02:06:33.540
<v Speaker 1>the idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2801
02:06:33.541 --> 02:06:38.310
<v Speaker 1>he came from an upper class super </v>
<v Speaker 1>elitist background and he realize,</v>

2802
02:06:38.460 --> 02:06:40.350
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of people back then works in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2803
02:06:40.351 --> 02:06:41.184
<v Speaker 1>our kids are going to be enough to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of Williams because they are too </v>

2804
02:06:43.051 --> 02:06:43.884
<v Speaker 1>pampered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he solution since he was a </v>

2805
02:06:46.201 --> 02:06:48.870
<v Speaker 1>teenager was boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestling,</v>

2806
02:06:48.871 --> 02:06:52.320
<v Speaker 1>hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just these very tough mainly things.</v>

2807
02:06:52.830 --> 02:06:55.740
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what he thrived on this </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole idea of like,</v>

2808
02:06:55.770 --> 02:06:57.030
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to,</v>

2809
02:06:57.060 --> 02:06:59.820
<v Speaker 1>he had a great quote about you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep your barbaric things,</v>

2810
02:06:59.821 --> 02:07:01.890
<v Speaker 1>things in order to go along with </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization.</v>

2811
02:07:01.890 --> 02:07:03.240
<v Speaker 1>And that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's perfect.</v>

2812
02:07:03.241 --> 02:07:05.090
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like the best of both words.</v>

2813
02:07:05.091 --> 02:07:06.780
<v Speaker 1>And yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guys,</v>

2814
02:07:07.140 --> 02:07:09.300
<v Speaker 1>I had a blast style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I knew about him,</v>

2815
02:07:09.301 --> 02:07:10.134
<v Speaker 1>but once you get to do a series,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really need to know your stuff in </v>

2816
02:07:13.081 --> 02:07:13.914
<v Speaker 1>and out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was so fun to study his life </v>

2817
02:07:15.960 --> 02:07:16.793
<v Speaker 1>because it was a stand out like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And The Times that he did and the early </v>

2818
02:07:20.101 --> 02:07:23.430
<v Speaker 1>19 hundreds I mean really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really pretty significant.</v>

2819
02:07:23.730 --> 02:07:25.860
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually one of the things that I</v>

2820
02:07:25.861 --> 02:07:26.694
<v Speaker 1>dig about that I do a little different </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the way Dan approaches hardcore </v>

2821
02:07:30.421 --> 02:07:31.254
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dan tend to look at things from the big </v>

2822
02:07:33.481 --> 02:07:34.291
<v Speaker 1>picture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2823
02:07:34.291 --> 02:07:37.240
<v Speaker 1>he's telling you big picture stories and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I loved that.</v>

2824
02:07:37.270 --> 02:07:41.480
<v Speaker 1>But I also like jam pinning too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like biographies.</v>

2825
02:07:41.740 --> 02:07:46.030
<v Speaker 1>I like sometimes telling the story of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this one guy and what he really meant to</v>

2826
02:07:46.031 --> 02:07:47.980
<v Speaker 1>be this individual in this story.</v>

2827
02:07:47.980 --> 02:07:48.970
<v Speaker 1>And so I did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2828
02:07:48.971 --> 02:07:51.850
<v Speaker 1>I did to the Roosevelt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did one on crazy horse.</v>

2829
02:07:51.940 --> 02:07:55.480
<v Speaker 1>I did one on [inaudible] painter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about catch up.</v>

2830
02:07:55.500 --> 02:07:57.950
<v Speaker 1>I've got to catch up as long as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>blind that you was dig.</v>

2831
02:07:58.240 --> 02:08:00.490
<v Speaker 1>I had did the Jack and Jill on some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2832
02:08:00.491 --> 02:08:04.230
<v Speaker 1>the first black heavyweight champion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's so fun.</v>

2833
02:08:04.340 --> 02:08:05.173
<v Speaker 1>You know my favorite Jack Johnson story </v>
<v Speaker 1>is he got pulled over for speeding up </v>

2834
02:08:07.821 --> 02:08:10.600
<v Speaker 1>the cars and the story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2835

<v Speaker 1>That's exactly,</v>

2836
02:08:12.460 --> 02:08:14.080
<v Speaker 1>I was telling that Carolyn the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2837

<v Speaker 1>I've got to do Jack Johnson and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ward by ward what you say.</v>

2838
02:08:17.801 --> 02:08:18.481
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

2839
02:08:18.481 --> 02:08:20.240
<v Speaker 1>that's my favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jack Johnson started.</v>

2840
02:08:20.920 --> 02:08:21.850
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2874
02:09:44.201 --> 02:09:48.310
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about just a few decades </v>
<v Speaker 1>after slavery.</v>

2875
02:09:48.350 --> 02:09:49.031
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

<v Speaker 1>in his family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2886
02:10:17.560 --> 02:10:18.393
<v Speaker 1>It's something good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about the civil rights movement </v>

2887
02:10:20.441 --> 02:10:20.861
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's everyone.</v>

2892
02:10:27.670 --> 02:10:29.500

<v Speaker 1>the White House,</v>

<v Speaker 1>black guy was officially invited for </v>

2896
02:10:37.131 --> 02:10:40.670

<v Speaker 1>had the dinner.</v>

<v Speaker 3>keep you there so you can't hate him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then once in a while he would break </v>

2957
02:13:35.161 --> 02:13:35.994
<v Speaker 3>free,</v>
<v Speaker 3>throw an upper cut and go back to </v>

2958
02:13:36.980 --> 02:13:41.070
<v Speaker 3>Clinton did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was fucking jacked for the time.</v>

2959
02:13:41.071 --> 02:13:41.904
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you think about this time like </v>

2960
02:13:43.021 --> 02:13:43.854
<v Speaker 3>people back then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know there was no fucking </v>

2961
02:13:46.381 --> 02:13:47.490
<v Speaker 3>supplements.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2962
02:13:47.520 --> 02:13:49.590
<v Speaker 3>They barely knew how to work out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

2963
02:13:49.830 --> 02:13:50.663
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even when he's punching like his </v>

2964
02:13:52.201 --> 02:13:54.250
<v Speaker 3>technique is very different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

2965
02:13:54.580 --> 02:13:55.413
<v Speaker 3>They and also they had a be really </v>
<v Speaker 3>concerned about breaking their hands </v>

2966
02:13:58.560 --> 02:13:59.393
<v Speaker 3>because they were fighting with these </v>
<v Speaker 3>little tiny ass gloves and basically </v>

2967
02:14:02.300 --> 02:14:05.280
<v Speaker 3>like mma gloves with thumbs in some of </v>
<v Speaker 3>these fights,</v>

2968
02:14:05.281 --> 02:14:07.530
<v Speaker 3>like they were scheduled for insane </v>
<v Speaker 3>sinks.</v>

2969
02:14:07.531 --> 02:14:08.364
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe this one was scheduled for 45 </v>

2970
02:14:09.631 --> 02:14:10.464
<v Speaker 3>rounds.</v>

2971
02:14:12.150 --> 02:14:14.010
<v Speaker 3>How many rounds it go?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2972
02:14:14.011 --> 02:14:19.011
<v Speaker 3>I think 15 fourth at 2:00 PM in July,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nevada.</v>

2973
02:14:20.310 --> 02:14:22.350

<v Speaker 3>weather.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Everyone in the crowd.</v>

2978
02:14:32.291 --> 02:14:34.650
<v Speaker 3>They were in the same hat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good point Jamie.</v>

2979
02:14:34.680 --> 02:14:35.513
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they all wore those goofy ass fucking </v>

<v Speaker 3>hats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like why did everybody like I want to </v>

2981
02:14:39.091 --> 02:14:39.924

2982
02:14:42.450 --> 02:14:43.283
<v Speaker 3>while I watched our white race sex hade </v>
<v Speaker 3>like how many black people in the </v>

2983
02:14:46.171 --> 02:14:49.710
<v Speaker 3>audience [inaudible] you can count on </v>
<v Speaker 3>that yet.</v>

2984
02:14:50.010 --> 02:14:50.843
<v Speaker 3>They say that the band before Jack and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jones came onto the rig shortly before </v>

2985
02:14:54.901 --> 02:14:56.400
<v Speaker 3>they announced the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he came on,</v>

2986
02:14:56.730 --> 02:14:57.563
<v Speaker 3>the band was playing these popular songs</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the time called old coons look alike </v>

2987
02:15:01.380 --> 02:15:04.620
<v Speaker 3>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2988
02:15:04.680 --> 02:15:06.330
<v Speaker 3>That's right before he comes on.</v>

2989
02:15:06.840 --> 02:15:07.673
<v Speaker 3>So this is like one of those things </v>
<v Speaker 3>where like people are hoping that the </v>

2990
02:15:10.801 --> 02:15:11.634
<v Speaker 3>bad guy loses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there millions of people are paying </v>

2991
02:15:14.581 --> 02:15:16.860
<v Speaker 3>attention because they want Jack Johnson</v>
<v Speaker 3>to lose.</v>

2992
02:15:16.890 --> 02:15:17.723
<v Speaker 3>It's not that they are hoping a good </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight takes place and let's see who </v>

2993
02:15:21.301 --> 02:15:22.134
<v Speaker 3>wins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They wanted to get this guy off the </v>

2994
02:15:24.091 --> 02:15:26.760
<v Speaker 3>throne.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was in tvm about boxing.</v>

2995
02:15:26.761 --> 02:15:28.620
<v Speaker 3>These was about race.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2996
02:15:29.430 --> 02:15:31.650
<v Speaker 3>Real kind of amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I went as long as it did.</v>

2997
02:15:31.710 --> 02:15:33.150
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And here they are.</v>

2998
02:15:33.151 --> 02:15:33.984
<v Speaker 3>They're in the 13th round.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You gotta be a different kind of human </v>

2999
02:15:36.121 --> 02:15:39.510
<v Speaker 3>to fight with those little gloves for as</v>
<v Speaker 3>many rounds as these people fought.</v>

3000
02:15:39.540 --> 02:15:40.960
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3001
02:15:41.050 --> 02:15:44.940
<v Speaker 3>it was geisler fascinating stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or who else have you covered,</v>

3002
02:15:44.941 --> 02:15:45.531
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

3003
02:15:45.531 --> 02:15:48.120
<v Speaker 3>on your podcast?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Biographies?</v>

3004
02:15:48.180 --> 02:15:51.030
<v Speaker 3>Let me think that you really like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it changed the way you feel about them.</v>

3005
02:15:51.090 --> 02:15:52.590
<v Speaker 3>Checking Johnson was awesome.</v>

3006
02:15:52.800 --> 02:15:54.840
<v Speaker 3>I had so much fun studying though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

3007
02:15:54.841 --> 02:15:56.880
<v Speaker 3>all the biographies done or some of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>favorites.</v>

3008
02:15:56.881 --> 02:15:58.880
<v Speaker 3>He unforgivable blackness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3009
02:15:59.140 --> 02:16:01.110
<v Speaker 3>that was the first thing when I started </v>
<v Speaker 3>the research,</v>

3010
02:16:01.111 --> 02:16:01.944
<v Speaker 3>that was where I started.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started watching the Ken Burns </v>

3011
02:16:03.781 --> 02:16:05.130
<v Speaker 3>documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was great.</v>

3012
02:16:05.640 --> 02:16:08.190
<v Speaker 3>And that kind of gave me the basics of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the story.</v>

3013
02:16:08.250 --> 02:16:08.851
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3014
02:16:08.851 --> 02:16:09.684
<v Speaker 3>I see where all of you to going now go </v>
<v Speaker 3>back through the tedious stuff or three </v>

3015
02:16:12.721 --> 02:16:16.470
<v Speaker 3>devotee damn book about him and plugging</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the information and stuff.</v>

3016
02:16:16.471 --> 02:16:17.760
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the documentary is great.</v>

3017
02:16:17.761 --> 02:16:18.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love that one.</v>

3018
02:16:19.200 --> 02:16:21.940
<v Speaker 3>So who else have you done that really </v>
<v Speaker 3>like kind of stood out for you?</v>

3019
02:16:21.950 --> 02:16:25.110
<v Speaker 3>So the big ones have been a crazy horse </v>
<v Speaker 3>caravan.</v>

3020
02:16:25.160 --> 02:16:27.380
<v Speaker 3>Joe Theodore Roosevelt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jack Johnson.</v>

3021
02:16:27.390 --> 02:16:30.120
<v Speaker 3>Those are the biographies I've done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Crazy horse is a fast</v>

3022
02:16:30.120 --> 02:16:30.953
<v Speaker 1>anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they still doing that crazy South </v>

3023
02:16:32.680 --> 02:16:34.210
<v Speaker 1>Dakota sculpture of him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3024
02:16:34.211 --> 02:16:35.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3025
02:16:35.831 --> 02:16:36.664
<v Speaker 1>I'll put him to do it forever because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy who started a project is long </v>

3026
02:16:39.461 --> 02:16:40.890
<v Speaker 1>dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so right.</v>

3027
02:16:40.990 --> 02:16:43.000
<v Speaker 1>Second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they depend on private money.</v>

3028
02:16:43.001 --> 02:16:45.050
<v Speaker 1>So they are not really moving a tiny </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of,</v>

3029
02:16:45.280 --> 02:16:48.550
<v Speaker 1>so isn't it kind of fucked because there</v>
<v Speaker 1>was no pictures of crazy horse.</v>

3030
02:16:48.551 --> 02:16:50.470
<v Speaker 1>We literally have no idea what I looked </v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

3031
02:16:50.560 --> 02:16:52.060
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None whatsoever.</v>

3032
02:16:52.120 --> 02:16:54.790
<v Speaker 1>If you're doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just essentially like guessing.</v>

3033
02:16:54.791 --> 02:16:56.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could use your face completely.</v>

3034
02:16:56.740 --> 02:16:58.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they should use my face.</v>

3035
02:16:58.880 --> 02:17:01.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why not the,</v>

3036
02:17:01.330 --> 02:17:03.310
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a better story right there.</v>

3037
02:17:03.311 --> 02:17:05.590
<v Speaker 1>Cause that was a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he kind of a,</v>

3038
02:17:05.630 --> 02:17:08.140
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like watching a Maryville </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing about wolverine.</v>

3039
02:17:08.141 --> 02:17:08.974
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has this super power that guy was a </v>

3040
02:17:10.061 --> 02:17:10.894
<v Speaker 1>beast in warfare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but everyone he loved around him died </v>

3041
02:17:13.960 --> 02:17:18.130
<v Speaker 1>and so you'll have these kind of tragic </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure off the guy was a beast.</v>

3042
02:17:18.220 --> 02:17:21.130
<v Speaker 1>But for all his powers he can protect </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones they love.</v>

3043
02:17:21.250 --> 02:17:25.960
<v Speaker 1>Well he fought naked and cut little </v>
<v Speaker 1>pieces of his body off.</v>

3044
02:17:25.990 --> 02:17:29.260
<v Speaker 1>Like he cut chunks of flesh off all over</v>
<v Speaker 1>his body.</v>

3045
02:17:29.261 --> 02:17:32.200
<v Speaker 1>Like his entire body was like a mosaic </v>
<v Speaker 1>of scars.</v>

3046
02:17:32.350 --> 02:17:36.460
<v Speaker 1>There was um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah it was even before like a couple of</v>

3047
02:17:36.460 --> 02:17:38.140
<v Speaker 1>weeks before the battle of the little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bighorn.</v>

3048
02:17:38.150 --> 02:17:42.840
<v Speaker 1>It is the famous bath towel with Costa </v>
<v Speaker 1>and doto flood and there was a 16 bul.</v>

3049
02:17:42.850 --> 02:17:43.683
<v Speaker 1>One of the other main Lakota leaders </v>
<v Speaker 1>participated in his sundance and one of </v>

3050
02:17:46.721 --> 02:17:47.554
<v Speaker 1>the things they did was kind of cut like</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 flesh all fitting Oni Sharm where do </v>

3051
02:17:51.221 --> 02:17:55.030
<v Speaker 1>you kind of cut these like pin size </v>
<v Speaker 1>needle of your flesh but steel.</v>

3052
02:17:55.180 --> 02:17:58.810
<v Speaker 1>And the whole point is to go into this </v>
<v Speaker 1>trance partially from the pain,</v>

3053
02:17:58.811 --> 02:18:02.830
<v Speaker 1>partially from dehydration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>peripherally prayer and Dolo fit and the</v>

3054
02:18:02.831 --> 02:18:03.664
<v Speaker 1>stories that sitting bull then at this </v>
<v Speaker 1>vision that they were going to be </v>

3055
02:18:07.121 --> 02:18:07.954
<v Speaker 1>attacked.</v>

3056
02:18:08.050 --> 02:18:10.150
<v Speaker 1>The troops were going to reach their </v>
<v Speaker 1>camp,</v>

3057
02:18:10.180 --> 02:18:11.013
<v Speaker 1>but they were going to get crushed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the vision was even at a bath </v>

3058
02:18:14.101 --> 02:18:16.120
<v Speaker 1>towel shortly thereafter and sitting </v>
<v Speaker 1>bull was like,</v>

3059
02:18:16.121 --> 02:18:16.954
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this wasn't,</v>

3060
02:18:16.960 --> 02:18:20.410
<v Speaker 1>this wasn't close to our camp division </v>
<v Speaker 1>is they are attacking our camp.</v>

3061
02:18:20.980 --> 02:18:23.620
<v Speaker 1>And that's when supposedly the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bighorn thing,</v>

3062
02:18:23.680 --> 02:18:26.230
<v Speaker 1>that's why they were feeling kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>like we can handle it.</v>

3063
02:18:26.260 --> 02:18:28.450
<v Speaker 1>We're good with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She wish she knew if that was true.</v>

3064
02:18:28.810 --> 02:18:29.980
<v Speaker 1>The whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3065
02:18:29.990 --> 02:18:30.821
<v Speaker 1>vision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3066
02:18:30.821 --> 02:18:31.654
<v Speaker 1>Dares to think about that kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture where the stories that they say </v>

3067
02:18:38.131 --> 02:18:38.964
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of the time in order to get a</v>
<v Speaker 1>reputation for being the guy who can </v>

3068
02:18:41.621 --> 02:18:42.161
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3069
02:18:42.161 --> 02:18:44.110
<v Speaker 1>I had a vision and people actually </v>

3084
02:19:09.071 --> 02:19:09.904
<v Speaker 1>You're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wish we knew that like him going </v>

3085
02:19:13.451 --> 02:19:17.280
<v Speaker 1>into a state of mind where it was almost</v>
<v Speaker 1>dying because you're like,</v>

3086
02:19:18.190 --> 02:19:19.023
<v Speaker 1>what was that a a man called horse of </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie where they do that thing that </v>

3087
02:19:22.860 --> 02:19:25.300
<v Speaker 1>barb's through your nipples and hang you</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the ceiling.</v>

3088
02:19:25.480 --> 02:19:27.770
<v Speaker 1>That's a sundance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been actually too,</v>

3089
02:19:28.280 --> 02:19:30.350
<v Speaker 1>because that was illegal for a really </v>
<v Speaker 1>long time.</v>

3090
02:19:30.351 --> 02:19:32.390
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they brought it back in the open in</v>

3091
02:19:32.391 --> 02:19:35.630
<v Speaker 1>the 1970s,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've been to,</v>

3092
02:19:35.750 --> 02:19:38.280
<v Speaker 1>I think seven sun dances rarely do that.</v>

3093
02:19:38.480 --> 02:19:39.313
<v Speaker 1>You've watched people get suspended by </v>
<v Speaker 1>their nipples that usually don't get </v>

3094
02:19:41.661 --> 02:19:44.510
<v Speaker 1>suspended and is non nipples is uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the um,</v>

3095
02:19:44.570 --> 02:19:45.403
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3096
02:19:45.490 --> 02:19:46.323
<v Speaker 1>the chest muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well they don't go under the muscle is </v>

3097
02:19:47.721 --> 02:19:50.690
<v Speaker 1>just kin but they go up on top and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

3098
02:19:51.230 --> 02:19:52.063
<v Speaker 1>So they usually don't get suspended but </v>
<v Speaker 1>they dance attach we there is a rope to </v>

3099
02:19:55.281 --> 02:19:59.540
<v Speaker 1>the tree and then when they want a bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>of clues they just rip right through.</v>

3100
02:19:59.541 --> 02:20:02.480
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got like these quarter size,</v>

3101
02:20:02.481 --> 02:20:07.070
<v Speaker 1>the scar I auto fit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And which you know,</v>

3102
02:20:07.071 --> 02:20:07.904
<v Speaker 1>when you think about the whole idea of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice is something that they do in </v>

3103
02:20:10.581 --> 02:20:13.550
<v Speaker 1>all the religions pretty much to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>friendly degrees.</v>

3104
02:20:14.300 --> 02:20:15.133
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back in the day animal sacrifice was </v>

3105
02:20:16.941 --> 02:20:19.100
<v Speaker 1>huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was one of the sinks and you know,</v>

3106
02:20:19.101 --> 02:20:19.934
<v Speaker 1>these guys have it as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shed the blood cause that's your </v>

3107
02:20:23.361 --> 02:20:23.780
<v Speaker 1>energy.</v>

3108
02:20:23.780 --> 02:20:24.613
<v Speaker 1>That's the one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that will give strength to your </v>

3109
02:20:26.181 --> 02:20:29.090
<v Speaker 1>prayers and all of that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

3110
02:20:29.091 --> 02:20:31.940
<v Speaker 1>first time I ever saw it I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

3111
02:20:31.970 --> 02:20:32.803
<v Speaker 1>this is intense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is probably also something to that </v>

3112
02:20:35.091 --> 02:20:39.770
<v Speaker 1>where they're trying to put people </v>
<v Speaker 1>through something to make them stronger.</v>

3113
02:20:40.760 --> 02:20:42.710
<v Speaker 1>There definitely is that aspect and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is like,</v>

3114
02:20:42.711 --> 02:20:45.050
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not something that somebody does</v>

3115
02:20:45.051 --> 02:20:45.884
<v Speaker 1>Willy Nilly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3119
02:20:50.391 --> 02:20:51.224

3120
02:20:52.161 --> 02:20:52.994
<v Speaker 1>resolve and make their better warriors </v>

3127
02:21:12.621 --> 02:21:13.454
<v Speaker 1>annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it looks like the betties on Venice </v>

<v Speaker 1>beach right now.</v>

3129
02:21:17.720 --> 02:21:18.553
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a story that they say about can </v>

<v Speaker 1>see yours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when he was a kid to toughen </v>

3131

3132
02:21:22.400 --> 02:21:23.130
<v Speaker 1>dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3133
02:21:23.130 --> 02:21:25.550

<v Speaker 1>that they were going to it.</v>

3134
02:21:25.760 --> 02:21:30.470
<v Speaker 1>But the story goes that the turtle heart</v>
<v Speaker 1>keeps beating after it's dead for awhile</v>

3135
02:21:30.980 --> 02:21:31.813
<v Speaker 1>and carved out with the third girl and </v>
<v Speaker 1>pull out this still beating heart and </v>

<v Speaker 1>He'll be team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3139
02:21:42.770 --> 02:21:45.230

<v Speaker 1>get from turtle hearts.</v>

3140
02:21:46.430 --> 02:21:48.590
<v Speaker 1>But as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say cook that well done.</v>

3141
02:21:48.710 --> 02:21:49.543
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the only way to have seven good </v>

3142
02:21:52.140 --> 02:21:53.480
<v Speaker 1>third heart.</v>

<v Speaker 1>when you think about like walls or you </v>

3146
02:22:00.651 --> 02:22:03.470

<v Speaker 1>they could eat stuff that if we try </v>
<v Speaker 1>today were dead in 30 seconds and they </v>

3186
02:23:27.761 --> 02:23:28.630
<v Speaker 1>Some item,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll start.</v>

3187
02:23:28.631 --> 02:23:30.100
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's fucking them.</v>

3188
02:23:30.340 --> 02:23:33.430
<v Speaker 1>We have a profound hypocrisy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine by me.</v>

3189
02:23:33.880 --> 02:23:35.020
<v Speaker 1>Don't you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>

3190
02:23:35.021 --> 02:23:35.854
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're probably more aware of that than </v>

3191
02:23:36.641 --> 02:23:38.710
<v Speaker 1>the average person because of your study</v>
<v Speaker 1>of history.</v>

3192
02:23:39.820 --> 02:23:41.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3193
02:23:41.230 --> 02:23:42.063
<v Speaker 1>the hypocrisy of the human race are most</v>
<v Speaker 1>exposed by going over them and the </v>

3194
02:23:46.480 --> 02:23:49.270
<v Speaker 1>washing these patterns repeat themselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>over and over and over again.</v>

3195
02:23:49.720 --> 02:23:50.111
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3196
02:23:50.111 --> 02:23:51.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3197
02:23:51.250 --> 02:23:52.083
<v Speaker 1>that's why to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm completely fascinated by the inner </v>

3198
02:23:54.611 --> 02:23:55.444
<v Speaker 1>workings of the human mind because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way that people can spin stories to </v>

3199
02:23:59.111 --> 02:23:59.944
<v Speaker 1>themselves to justify stuff that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>another context will be going see </v>

3200
02:24:02.501 --> 02:24:03.334
<v Speaker 1>they're completely insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That kind of goes back to that like the </v>

3201
02:24:05.981 --> 02:24:08.810
<v Speaker 1>average person is a flag in the wind </v>
<v Speaker 1>that can go anyway.</v>

3202
02:24:08.880 --> 02:24:11.920
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how ridiculous is it that like 200 years</v>

3203
02:24:11.921 --> 02:24:12.754
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you tell people this lavery </v>

3204
02:24:15.190 --> 02:24:16.960
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming majority of people would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3205
02:24:16.961 --> 02:24:19.440
<v Speaker 1>of course slavery school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's wrong with at it?</v>

3206
02:24:19.570 --> 02:24:20.410
<v Speaker 1>Kind of a free car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

3207
02:24:20.411 --> 02:24:22.480
<v Speaker 1>your anti slavery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you insane?</v>

3208
02:24:22.810 --> 02:24:24.260
<v Speaker 1>And if you say today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3209
02:24:24.300 --> 02:24:28.600
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have like 0.01% of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>population would be cool with it.</v>

3210
02:24:28.600 --> 02:24:31.030
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet we're the same people,</v>

3211
02:24:31.031 --> 02:24:31.864
<v Speaker 1>200 years have gone by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but suddenly what was completely normal </v>

3212
02:24:34.481 --> 02:24:37.210
<v Speaker 1>at one point is considered batshit crazy</v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

3213
02:24:37.300 --> 02:24:38.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is weird.</v>

3214
02:24:38.650 --> 02:24:39.431
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

3215
02:24:39.431 --> 02:24:41.120
<v Speaker 1>and it's constantly changing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3216
02:24:41.410 --> 02:24:44.170
<v Speaker 1>constantly evolving and it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>always need to make sense.</v>

3217
02:24:44.171 --> 02:24:45.760
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what's the new thing?</v>

3218
02:24:45.770 --> 02:24:46.603
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the new way of being and you </v>

3219
02:24:48.341 --> 02:24:50.290
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always a small percentage of our</v>

3220
02:24:50.291 --> 02:24:51.124
<v Speaker 1>population that's not going to go along </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the program that's going to be </v>

3221
02:24:53.111 --> 02:24:53.771
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3222
02:24:53.771 --> 02:24:55.420
<v Speaker 1>this is a stupid idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

3223
02:24:55.900 --> 02:25:00.430
<v Speaker 1>but the average is just going to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>wherever critical mass is steel team.</v>

3224
02:25:00.490 --> 02:25:03.010
