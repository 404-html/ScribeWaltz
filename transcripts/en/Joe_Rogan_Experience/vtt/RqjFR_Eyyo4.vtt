00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.000
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.320
<v Speaker 1>That's the good version of it.</v>

3
00:00:04.321 --> 00:00:04.651
<v Speaker 1>Or whatever.</v>

4
00:00:04.651 --> 00:00:06.330
<v Speaker 1>In Dubai in Dubai,</v>

5
00:00:06.331 --> 00:00:09.190
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting because they stopped paying and the fucking workers just start</v>

6
00:00:09.191 --> 00:00:10.024
<v Speaker 1>walking home.</v>

7
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.470
<v Speaker 1>It just all pack their shit and started walking to the edge of town.</v>

8
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.570
<v Speaker 1>That whole place is so crazy that they were ever been there.</v>

9
00:00:15.571 --> 00:00:16.404
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

10
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.330
<v Speaker 1>there were appalling at such a high level and then it just kind of all came</v>

11
00:00:21.331 --> 00:00:22.164
<v Speaker 1>crashing down.</v>

12
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.630
<v Speaker 2>It's a resource based economy and limited resource based economy and you can't</v>

13
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.110
<v Speaker 2>eventually that's going to go dry no matter if it's now or 50 years from now,</v>

14
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.270
<v Speaker 2>you're banking your whole worth on oil.</v>

15
00:00:31.271 --> 00:00:34.600
<v Speaker 2>These fuckers are going to be hocking rugs like they were in the fifties sooner</v>

16
00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:35.291
<v Speaker 2>than they know it.</v>

17
00:00:35.291 --> 00:00:36.370
<v Speaker 2>And it's going to be a creepy</v>

18
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.210
<v Speaker 1>period for them.</v>

19
00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:37.331
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

20
00:00:37.331 --> 00:00:38.730
<v Speaker 1>they also have debtor's prisons,</v>

21
00:00:38.731 --> 00:00:39.550
<v Speaker 1>so you can't be,</v>

22
00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:40.383
<v Speaker 1>you can't be in debt.</v>

23
00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:41.770
<v Speaker 1>You can't just go bankrupt over there.</v>

24
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.060
<v Speaker 1>They just lock you up in jail.</v>

25
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:43.961
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of people,</v>

26
00:00:43.961 --> 00:00:45.550
<v Speaker 1>they parked their Mercedes at the airport,</v>

27
00:00:45.551 --> 00:00:47.020
<v Speaker 1>got on a flight and just left everything.</v>

28
00:00:47.021 --> 00:00:47.860
<v Speaker 1>But hopefully like,</v>

29
00:00:47.861 --> 00:00:48.694
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be in jail.</v>

30
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:49.810
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you and your country.</v>

31
00:00:49.811 --> 00:00:51.850
<v Speaker 1>Take care of exactly what people were living there.</v>

32
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.380
<v Speaker 1>Like Michael Jackson was living there.</v>

33
00:00:53.381 --> 00:00:53.770
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

34
00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.981
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

35
00:00:53.981 --> 00:00:55.030
<v Speaker 1>it got to be this,</v>

36
00:00:55.031 --> 00:00:55.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

37
00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.440
<v Speaker 1>really the idea of this enchanted paradise place where millionaires and just</v>

38
00:00:59.441 --> 00:01:00.140
<v Speaker 1>sounds like nuts.</v>

39
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.280
<v Speaker 1>And it sounds like the Las Vegas run by southern Baptists.</v>

40
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

41
00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:04.261
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing.</v>

42
00:01:04.261 --> 00:01:04.861
<v Speaker 1>It's really fast.</v>

43
00:01:04.861 --> 00:01:05.800
<v Speaker 1>And religious police,</v>

44
00:01:05.801 --> 00:01:08.470
<v Speaker 1>like I got them called on me during my show.</v>

45
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.860

00:01:18.881 --> 00:01:21.640
<v Speaker 2>he did a second 45 and I introduced him in between show.</v>

56
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.821

<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

61
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.000
<v Speaker 2>so I'm up on stage and um,</v>

62
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.030
<v Speaker 2>I had gone up to the top of the Burj Khalifa,</v>

63
00:01:28.031 --> 00:01:28.631
<v Speaker 2>the tower,</v>

64
00:01:28.631 --> 00:01:29.980
<v Speaker 2>the tallest building in the world.</v>

65
00:01:29.981 --> 00:01:33.790
<v Speaker 2>I have now been in four of the tallest structures in the school,</v>

66
00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:34.181
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

67
00:01:34.181 --> 00:01:34.361
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

68
00:01:34.361 --> 00:01:34.481
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

69
00:01:34.481 --> 00:01:35.290
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>

70
00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.950
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty,</v>

71
00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:36.783
<v Speaker 2>it's actually,</v>

72
00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.010
<v Speaker 2>you know what it looks like it's the same deal you get in a landing airplane.</v>

73
00:01:39.011 --> 00:01:42.760
<v Speaker 2>You know when you're flying into lax and you're over the what would be Pasadena</v>

74
00:01:42.761 --> 00:01:44.200
<v Speaker 2>and all that Shit and you're that high in the air.</v>

75
00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:45.010
<v Speaker 2>That's what it looks like.</v>

76
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.160
<v Speaker 2>I would just start shitting and pissing him pass out.</v>

77
00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.970
<v Speaker 2>But it's all dirt.</v>

78
00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:49.720
<v Speaker 2>It's terrible.</v>

79
00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:50.980
<v Speaker 2>And I even said like,</v>

80
00:01:50.981 --> 00:01:54.580
<v Speaker 2>I think it's great you guys built a tower that high because that's dirt looks</v>

81
00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:56.560
<v Speaker 2>its best from about 3000 feet.</v>

82
00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:57.423
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

83
00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.720
<v Speaker 2>Dirt up close sucks,</v>

84
00:01:58.721 --> 00:02:01.330
<v Speaker 2>but all this dirt so great to see it cause there's no,</v>

85
00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:02.860
<v Speaker 2>they implant any fucking trees.</v>

86
00:02:02.861 --> 00:02:03.700
<v Speaker 2>It's all construction.</v>

87
00:02:03.701 --> 00:02:04.534
<v Speaker 2>It looks like shit.</v>

88
00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:05.583
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

89
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.380
<v Speaker 2>and they don't even like the biggest observation deck doesn't even face the</v>

90
00:02:08.381 --> 00:02:08.771
<v Speaker 2>water,</v>

91
00:02:08.771 --> 00:02:11.380
<v Speaker 2>the Caspian Sea cause they wanted to impress people with what the city looks</v>

92
00:02:11.381 --> 00:02:11.561
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

93
00:02:11.561 --> 00:02:13.300
<v Speaker 2>So they put the observation deck on the inside.</v>

94
00:02:13.301 --> 00:02:14.500
<v Speaker 2>Well the city hasn't been built yet,</v>

95
00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:15.610
<v Speaker 2>so bullshit.</v>

96
00:02:15.611 --> 00:02:15.861
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

97
00:02:15.861 --> 00:02:16.694
<v Speaker 2>so I go up to the top of it.</v>

98
00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.870
<v Speaker 2>It was originally called the Burj Dubai based on the city,</v>

99
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.240
<v Speaker 2>the Sheikh Khalifa.</v>

100
00:02:22.241 --> 00:02:22.720
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

101
00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.500
<v Speaker 2>the president of the UAE gave them $10 billion to finish the tower,</v>

102
00:02:26.501 --> 00:02:30.390
<v Speaker 2>$10 billion to finish it because it didn't look like it was going to.</v>

103
00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.620
<v Speaker 2>And so the on opening day they decided,</v>

104
00:02:32.621 --> 00:02:32.951
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

105
00:02:32.951 --> 00:02:35.620
<v Speaker 2>Fuck this we're gonna name it Burj Khalifa after him,</v>

106
00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:37.300
<v Speaker 2>like this impulse thing.</v>

107
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.720
<v Speaker 2>But you go up in it and I was one of the first 200 people to go up in it,</v>

108
00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:41.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

109
00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.190
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

110
00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.290
<v Speaker 2>and I go up in the gift shop,</v>

111
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.590
<v Speaker 2>all has shit that says Burj Dubai on it and it's the same bullshit gift shop</v>

112
00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:48.041
<v Speaker 2>crap.</v>

113
00:02:48.041 --> 00:02:50.320
<v Speaker 2>You'd find that the Sears tower or in Disneyland,</v>

114
00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.000
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking golf shirts and,</v>

115
00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.850
<v Speaker 2>and pocket knives and bottle it</v>

116
00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:54.241
<v Speaker 1>winners.</v>

117
00:02:54.241 --> 00:02:55.200
<v Speaker 1>And they all have burdens.</v>

118
00:02:55.201 --> 00:02:58.620
<v Speaker 1>You buy paper weights where there's water in it and you can shake it all comes</v>

119
00:02:58.621 --> 00:02:59.510
<v Speaker 1>on that little tower.</v>

120
00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.820
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

121
00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:00.140
<v Speaker 1>Sudden</v>

122
00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.760
<v Speaker 2>sandstorm,</v>

123
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.420
<v Speaker 2>maybe we right when to get one of them.</v>

124
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:03.970
<v Speaker 2>It's stupid like,</v>

125
00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:05.260
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

126
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.880
<v Speaker 2>but it all still said Burj Dubai on it.</v>

127
00:03:06.881 --> 00:03:07.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

128
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.230
<v Speaker 2>this motherfucker gives you $10 billion and you can't replace the bullshit</v>

129
00:03:11.231 --> 00:03:12.880
<v Speaker 2>printed tee shirts in 24 hours.</v>

130
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.870
<v Speaker 2>What you say this?</v>

131
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:14.560
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

132
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.251
<v Speaker 2>So I basically,</v>

133
00:03:15.251 --> 00:03:19.060
<v Speaker 2>what I said on stage was it's pretty rude to miss your Khalifa.</v>

134
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.240
<v Speaker 2>I think that you,</v>

135
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

136
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.860
<v Speaker 2>that you did this or whatever because I'm not paying for my hotel room.</v>

137
00:03:23.861 --> 00:03:24.910
<v Speaker 2>But when I call room service,</v>

138
00:03:24.911 --> 00:03:25.270
<v Speaker 2>they say,</v>

139
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.811
<v Speaker 2>they say yes,</v>

140
00:03:25.811 --> 00:03:26.411
<v Speaker 2>Mr. Sparks.</v>

141
00:03:26.411 --> 00:03:28.180
<v Speaker 2>They don't say the guy who was in the room before me,</v>

142
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:29.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

143
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.900
<v Speaker 2>and I was actually trying to say something deferential,</v>

144
00:03:31.901 --> 00:03:32.950
<v Speaker 2>respectful to the guy.</v>

145
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:33.210
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

146
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:34.043
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>

147
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.290
<v Speaker 2>Well it was the fact that I said Miss Sheer Khalifa instead of shake Khalifa</v>

148
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.270
<v Speaker 2>that drove this one guy crazy and he stood up in the back like eight tables back</v>

149
00:03:43.271 --> 00:03:44.170
<v Speaker 2>and people were laughing.</v>

150
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.580
<v Speaker 2>So I didn't see this happen.</v>

151
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.020
<v Speaker 2>He was back in the dark</v>

152
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.200
<v Speaker 2>and he storms out of the fucking place.</v>

153
00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.950
<v Speaker 2>Woe is,</v>

154
00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:52.130
<v Speaker 2>I walk offstage to finish my set.</v>

155
00:03:52.131 --> 00:03:53.050
<v Speaker 2>It was great set actually.</v>

156
00:03:53.051 --> 00:03:54.040
<v Speaker 2>It had a great time and there was,</v>

157
00:03:54.041 --> 00:03:56.140
<v Speaker 2>he's like $40,000 tables,</v>

158
00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.531
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

159
00:03:56.531 --> 00:03:59.530
<v Speaker 2>Evers round tables in the front full of shakes and these guys and if I can,</v>

160
00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.170
<v Speaker 2>and women in their hijabs and Burkas and the whole deal.</v>

161
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.240
<v Speaker 2>And then there are business partners with west,</v>

162
00:04:04.241 --> 00:04:04.471
<v Speaker 2>so all,</v>

163
00:04:04.471 --> 00:04:04.601
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

164
00:04:04.601 --> 00:04:05.434
<v Speaker 2>it's really weird.</v>

165
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.090
<v Speaker 2>It's like offstage and the promoters there.</v>

166
00:04:07.091 --> 00:04:07.924
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>

167
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.710
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

168
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:09.280
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

169
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.113
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

170
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.820
<v Speaker 2>you said something that offended one of the shakes who was here.</v>

171
00:04:12.821 --> 00:04:14.980
<v Speaker 2>And so he called the CID,</v>

172
00:04:14.981 --> 00:04:15.731
<v Speaker 2>the religious police,</v>

173
00:04:15.731 --> 00:04:18.280
<v Speaker 2>and they're here and they're going to take you into custody.</v>

174
00:04:18.281 --> 00:04:19.330
<v Speaker 2>We'll try to,</v>

175
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.720
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

176
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.301
<v Speaker 2>this is fucked.</v>

177
00:04:20.301 --> 00:04:20.800
<v Speaker 2>That wow.</v>

178
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.500
<v Speaker 2>We'll try and mitigate it as much as we can.</v>

179
00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.850
<v Speaker 2>But the fine could be as much as $25,000 and three days in jail.</v>

180
00:04:27.851 --> 00:04:28.091
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

181
00:04:28.091 --> 00:04:29.500
<v Speaker 2>but we'll try and talk them down.</v>

182
00:04:29.501 --> 00:04:31.900
<v Speaker 2>And it might not be a big deal because we're not even sure what he was upset</v>

183
00:04:31.901 --> 00:04:32.471
<v Speaker 2>about yet.</v>

184
00:04:32.471 --> 00:04:33.720
<v Speaker 2>And we'll try to talk to them about,</v>

185
00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:34.810
<v Speaker 2>but can you go out,</v>

186
00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.590
<v Speaker 2>take this out,</v>

187
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.270
<v Speaker 2>can you go out and introduce John?</v>

188
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.110
<v Speaker 2>Fuck,</v>

189
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.310
<v Speaker 2>and then come back and we'll deal with it.</v>

190
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.280
<v Speaker 2>So I walk out on stage and I,</v>

191
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.500
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

192
00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.500
<v Speaker 2>I go up on date and I introduced John.</v>

193
00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.900
<v Speaker 2>And as I'm on there,</v>

194
00:04:46.901 --> 00:04:48.340
<v Speaker 2>as I'm on stage introducing them,</v>

195
00:04:48.341 --> 00:04:50.170
<v Speaker 2>I see them come down the aisle.</v>

196
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.370
<v Speaker 2>I see the religious police,</v>

197
00:04:51.371 --> 00:04:52.150
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

198
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.481
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

199
00:04:52.481 --> 00:04:52.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

200
00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:53.160
<v Speaker 2>four,</v>

201
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.730
<v Speaker 2>there are three of them in these white shirts with the little belts that across</v>

202
00:04:57.731 --> 00:04:58.301
<v Speaker 2>their chest.</v>

203
00:04:58.301 --> 00:05:01.960
<v Speaker 2>And then we'll stick holsters and stuff and they're walking down the aisle</v>

204
00:05:01.961 --> 00:05:05.620
<v Speaker 2>towards backstage and they go backstage.</v>

205
00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.040
<v Speaker 2>And I introduced John and instead of going backstage,</v>

206
00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.880
<v Speaker 2>I walked straight off the stage and walk right out to the lobby where they had a</v>

207
00:05:12.881 --> 00:05:14.990
<v Speaker 2>table set up for me to sell shit and sign things right.</v>

208
00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.110
<v Speaker 2>Whereas where I had intended to go in the first place,</v>

209
00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:18.431
<v Speaker 2>but I walked,</v>

210
00:05:18.431 --> 00:05:18.821
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

211
00:05:18.821 --> 00:05:19.710
<v Speaker 2>instead of going backstage,</v>

212
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:20.860
<v Speaker 2>I went straight out front.</v>

213
00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:21.161
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

214
00:05:21.161 --> 00:05:21.871
<v Speaker 2>they'll find me out there,</v>

215
00:05:21.871 --> 00:05:22.421
<v Speaker 2>they're going to find me,</v>

216
00:05:22.421 --> 00:05:23.021
<v Speaker 2>they going to find me,</v>

217
00:05:23.021 --> 00:05:25.810
<v Speaker 2>but I'm going to go out there and do that shit first and let them stew.</v>

218
00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:26.890
<v Speaker 2>You gotta sell your merchant.</v>

219
00:05:26.891 --> 00:05:27.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

220
00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:28.083
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

221
00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.290
<v Speaker 2>So I go outside and I'm taking a bunch of pictures and shit up there totally.</v>

222
00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:33.880
<v Speaker 2>And Dvds and,</v>

223
00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:34.900
<v Speaker 2>and took pictures and blah,</v>

224
00:05:34.901 --> 00:05:35.410
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>

225
00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:38.770
<v Speaker 2>And I had a bunch of people come out because John is Jewish,</v>

226
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:39.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm not Jewish.</v>

227
00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.470
<v Speaker 2>And they definitely have issues with Jews there.</v>

228
00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:42.490
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of them came,</v>

229
00:05:42.491 --> 00:05:45.090
<v Speaker 2>saw me and didn't stick around village,</v>

230
00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.761
<v Speaker 2>the Jew,</v>

231
00:05:45.761 --> 00:05:46.594
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

232
00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:47.440
<v Speaker 2>Assholes.</v>

233
00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:47.771
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

234
00:05:47.771 --> 00:05:52.180
<v Speaker 2>so they come out and these guys are back there for 10 fucking minutes before</v>

235
00:05:52.181 --> 00:05:53.950
<v Speaker 2>they realize he's not coming back.</v>

236
00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:54.730
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

237
00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:57.100
<v Speaker 2>And so they turn around and come out to the office and right when they walk,</v>

238
00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting a picture with a shake and his wife like this,</v>

239
00:06:00.231 --> 00:06:00.710
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

240
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.500
<v Speaker 2>like you were in fucking Wisconsin farm around both of them.</v>

241
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.540
<v Speaker 2>Big stupid grin there smiling.</v>

242
00:06:05.541 --> 00:06:08.150
<v Speaker 2>He's got his fucking classic sunglasses,</v>

243
00:06:08.151 --> 00:06:09.290
<v Speaker 2>White Shawl.</v>

244
00:06:09.291 --> 00:06:10.610
<v Speaker 2>The whole deal is white burqa.</v>

245
00:06:10.611 --> 00:06:11.840
<v Speaker 2>You can't even see her fucking,</v>

246
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.033
<v Speaker 2>this is it.</v>

247
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:14.990
<v Speaker 2>And I'm just a big smiling picture.</v>

248
00:06:14.991 --> 00:06:17.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm assuming she's smiling and um,</v>

249
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.941
<v Speaker 2>and they,</v>

250
00:06:17.941 --> 00:06:18.830
<v Speaker 2>they come out and they go,</v>

251
00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:19.971
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

252
00:06:19.971 --> 00:06:21.560
<v Speaker 2>if he had said anything offensive,</v>

253
00:06:21.561 --> 00:06:22.394
<v Speaker 2>these people would be,</v>

254
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.450
<v Speaker 2>they would not take a picture with him.</v>

255
00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:24.200
<v Speaker 2>This shaker right here.</v>

256
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.450
<v Speaker 2>And his wife would not be taking pictures if he said anything we're saying</v>

257
00:06:26.451 --> 00:06:27.260
<v Speaker 2>they'd saw it.</v>

258
00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:27.890
<v Speaker 2>There was,</v>

259
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:28.910
<v Speaker 2>so they basically said,</v>

260
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.230
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

261
00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:29.840
<v Speaker 2>he's not,</v>

262
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.790
<v Speaker 2>he didn't offend anybody because if he did,</v>

263
00:06:31.791 --> 00:06:32.870
<v Speaker 2>they would be mad too.</v>

264
00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:34.430
<v Speaker 2>And so they went to the,</v>

265
00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:34.821
<v Speaker 2>the shake.</v>

266
00:06:34.821 --> 00:06:35.990
<v Speaker 2>Who was standing by the doorway.</v>

267
00:06:35.991 --> 00:06:36.830
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know who it was,</v>

268
00:06:36.831 --> 00:06:39.080
<v Speaker 2>but apparently he was standing it and then they walked over with their arms</v>

269
00:06:39.081 --> 00:06:39.291
<v Speaker 2>crossed.</v>

270
00:06:39.291 --> 00:06:39.831
<v Speaker 2>What did he say?</v>

271
00:06:39.831 --> 00:06:40.820
<v Speaker 2>What was the big and he goes,</v>

272
00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:41.900
<v Speaker 2>well it wasn't what he said.</v>

273
00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.780
<v Speaker 2>I was just thought that other people might get offended.</v>

274
00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.620
<v Speaker 2>He started backtracking on what he said.</v>

275
00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.120
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

276
00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:51.950
<v Speaker 2>So they stuck around and watched John Show for about 10 minutes to make sure he</v>

277
00:06:51.951 --> 00:06:53.050
<v Speaker 2>wasn't doing anything untoward.</v>

278
00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.890
<v Speaker 2>And I think they ended up finding him $25,000 fine.</v>

279
00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:59.420
<v Speaker 2>John 25,000 mentioning his Judaism too much.</v>

280
00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:00.293
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

281
00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:00.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

282
00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:01.603
<v Speaker 2>fuck that.</v>

283
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:03.140
<v Speaker 2>Don't ever go there.</v>

284
00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:05.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah Dude Dude.</v>

285
00:07:05.841 --> 00:07:07.430
<v Speaker 2>So cause it wasn't anything else.</v>

286
00:07:07.431 --> 00:07:08.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean he does this thing.</v>

287
00:07:08.391 --> 00:07:09.410
<v Speaker 2>Bob Saget is gay.</v>

288
00:07:09.411 --> 00:07:10.280
<v Speaker 2>This song he does,</v>

289
00:07:10.281 --> 00:07:11.560
<v Speaker 2>which might've been it.</v>

290
00:07:11.561 --> 00:07:15.320
