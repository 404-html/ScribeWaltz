00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.171
<v Speaker 1>My day,</v>

2
00:00:01.171 --> 00:00:06.150
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan podcast by night all day about what the fuck are you talking about?</v>

3
00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.680
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] today you were dropping some knowledge on me about some gem where</v>

4
00:00:10.681 --> 00:00:14.430
<v Speaker 1>they're fighting the fucking movie with a black dudes.</v>

5
00:00:14.431 --> 00:00:16.890
<v Speaker 1>What's that movie that the kid came on here?</v>

6
00:00:16.891 --> 00:00:17.850
<v Speaker 1>Billy Corbin did.</v>

7
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:18.781
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

8
00:00:18.781 --> 00:00:19.470
<v Speaker 1>dog fight.</v>

9
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:19.741
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

10
00:00:19.741 --> 00:00:21.210
<v Speaker 1>And then when we told them about dog fighting,</v>

11
00:00:21.211 --> 00:00:24.060
<v Speaker 1>then you're talking about some gem and you said you'd save it for the podcast.</v>

12
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:25.470
<v Speaker 1>This is what I was telling you.</v>

13
00:00:25.471 --> 00:00:30.060
<v Speaker 1>Like do you know what happened with Conor Mcgregor and Nate Diaz with the</v>

14
00:00:30.061 --> 00:00:30.380
<v Speaker 1>bottles?</v>

15
00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.590
<v Speaker 1>They threw water bottles,</v>

16
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.270
<v Speaker 1>plastic water bottles.</v>

17
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:35.143
<v Speaker 1>They got well,</v>

18
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.960
<v Speaker 1>well some of them might have thrown a monster energy.</v>

19
00:00:36.961 --> 00:00:41.961
<v Speaker 1>Can someone throw a cam said if it can hit you or someone you care about that</v>

20
00:00:42.521 --> 00:00:44.040
<v Speaker 1>would suck the water bottles.</v>

21
00:00:44.041 --> 00:00:46.350
<v Speaker 1>Like come on anyway,</v>

22
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.410
<v Speaker 1>they got fined $150,000 and it should definitely shouldn't fucking throw water</v>

23
00:00:53.521 --> 00:00:54.120
<v Speaker 1>bottles.</v>

24
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:54.953
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

25
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.580
<v Speaker 1>So part of me is like,</v>

26
00:00:56.581 --> 00:00:59.160
<v Speaker 1>well if they could discourage throw water balls,</v>

27
00:00:59.161 --> 00:01:00.090
<v Speaker 1>that shit stupid.</v>

28
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.481
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

29
00:01:00.481 --> 00:01:00.990
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

30
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.880
<v Speaker 1>but did the altercation,</v>

31
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:03.810
<v Speaker 1>the altercations,</v>

32
00:01:03.811 --> 00:01:05.130
<v Speaker 1>probably good for business.</v>

33
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:06.210
<v Speaker 1>The altercation.</v>

34
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean I get excited.</v>

35
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.010
<v Speaker 1>I see Nate Diaz and Conor McGregor screaming at each other cry ain't no fuck</v>

36
00:01:11.011 --> 00:01:11.844
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

37
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.141
<v Speaker 1>No fuck you.</v>

38
00:01:13.141 --> 00:01:13.974
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>

39
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.540
<v Speaker 1>I can get crazy with each other.</v>

40
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.740
<v Speaker 1>It makes you excited.</v>

41
00:01:16.741 --> 00:01:18.690
<v Speaker 1>And I think that generates paper view buys.</v>

42
00:01:18.691 --> 00:01:19.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't think Conor stupid.</v>

43
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't think Nate stupid.</v>

44
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.640
<v Speaker 1>I think they're smart and I think they know what they're doing when it comes to</v>

45
00:01:23.641 --> 00:01:24.474
<v Speaker 1>that kind of stuff.</v>

46
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.310
<v Speaker 1>So that's a part of the show.</v>

47
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean did he really think he was going to hit him with that water bottle?</v>

48
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.620
<v Speaker 1>You know fucking Nate Diaz.</v>

49
00:01:31.621 --> 00:01:32.760
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to hit him with a punch.</v>

50
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.570
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck are you going to hit him with a water bottle that's coming from 300</v>

51
00:01:36.571 --> 00:01:36.990
<v Speaker 1>feet away?</v>

52
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.010
<v Speaker 1>He's not going to see that.</v>

53
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.470
<v Speaker 1>He's not going to move out of the way of that water bottle.</v>

54
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.701
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

55
00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:46.701
<v Speaker 1>I mean what they decide to get upset about and what they don't decide to get</v>

56
00:01:47.311 --> 00:01:49.800
<v Speaker 1>upset about is what's weird about athletic commissions.</v>

57
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

58
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.980
<v Speaker 1>Like one of the things they were talking about whether or not they were going to</v>

59
00:01:52.981 --> 00:01:57.870
<v Speaker 1>test Nate for his vape pen cause he had a CBD vape pen,</v>

60
00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.311
<v Speaker 1>which is CBD,</v>

61
00:01:59.311 --> 00:02:00.144
<v Speaker 1>not even,</v>

62
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.410
<v Speaker 1>not even psychoactive.</v>

63
00:02:01.411 --> 00:02:02.370
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make you high,</v>

64
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.140
<v Speaker 1>but it does alleviate some inflammation and it provides people that have like,</v>

65
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

66
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.400
<v Speaker 1>back pain or something like that or especially after a long fight provides you</v>

67
00:02:11.401 --> 00:02:12.390
<v Speaker 1>with a little relief.</v>

68
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.260
<v Speaker 1>But what's crazy is the only reason why they would want you to not do it,</v>

69
00:02:18.901 --> 00:02:20.850
<v Speaker 1>obviously it's not performance enhancing.</v>

70
00:02:20.851 --> 00:02:22.140
<v Speaker 1>You're not performing anymore.</v>

71
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.280
<v Speaker 1>The performance is over.</v>

72
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.070
<v Speaker 1>So are they protecting you from yourself?</v>

73
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.090
<v Speaker 1>Like what are they doing?</v>

74
00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.830
<v Speaker 1>They don't want you to do it because you're flaunting the fact that you're doing</v>

75
00:02:31.831 --> 00:02:32.750
<v Speaker 1>it in front of everybody.</v>

76
00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.590
<v Speaker 1>Like they piss him after the CBD just after he was smoking that I think he had</v>

77
00:02:37.591 --> 00:02:39.640
<v Speaker 1>already done his post fight fighting.</v>

78
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.270
<v Speaker 1>I think you do that before you do the press conference.</v>

79
00:02:42.271 --> 00:02:43.020
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

80
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.853
<v Speaker 1>I don't know though.</v>

81
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:44.693
<v Speaker 1>It's a good question.</v>

82
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm not entirely sure.</v>

83
00:02:46.111 --> 00:02:48.810
<v Speaker 1>And they might do it different way differently in different places,</v>

84
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.840
<v Speaker 1>but either way you're not concerned about him.</v>

85
00:02:51.841 --> 00:02:52.471
<v Speaker 1>Like what do you,</v>

86
00:02:52.471 --> 00:02:52.770
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

87
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.050
<v Speaker 1>What's the issue like what is the issue?</v>

88
00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.480
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

89
00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.250
<v Speaker 1>it looks bad.</v>

90
00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.780
<v Speaker 1>Does it look bad that he's dead?</v>

91
00:02:57.781 --> 00:02:58.680
<v Speaker 1>Vapors coming out?</v>

92
00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:59.740
<v Speaker 1>He's of dragons,</v>

93
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.270
<v Speaker 1>the CBD oil business.</v>

94
00:03:01.271 --> 00:03:02.200
<v Speaker 1>We're not the roof then.</v>

95
00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it did and it should and it should.</v>

96
00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.490
<v Speaker 1>The roof and wait and wait till it becomes illegal.</v>

97
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:07.533
<v Speaker 1>We're a month away.</v>

98
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:08.800
<v Speaker 1>When it becomes legal,</v>

99
00:03:08.801 --> 00:03:10.030
<v Speaker 1>then it's really going to go nuts.</v>

100
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.260
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be good for everybody.</v>

101
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:12.693
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>

102
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.190
<v Speaker 1>so they get fucking pissed at them for that.</v>

103
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:16.051
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>

104
00:03:16.051 --> 00:03:16.400
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

105
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.233
<v Speaker 1>the Connor,</v>

106
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:18.970
<v Speaker 1>the fine was so high.</v>

107
00:03:18.971 --> 00:03:21.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm like $150,000 wow.</v>

108
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.780
<v Speaker 1>Oh he said he made 40 million next time shut your mouth and they won't fucking</v>

109
00:03:25.781 --> 00:03:26.140
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

110
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.710
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

111
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:27.543
<v Speaker 1>100 you know,</v>

112
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:28.870

113
00:03:28.871 --> 00:03:29.560
<v Speaker 1>three mil,</v>

114
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.780
<v Speaker 1>half of that after taxes,</v>

115
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.330
<v Speaker 1>1.5 on 50 don't really put a dent in your fucking thing.</v>

116
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.340
<v Speaker 1>Next time you won't throw fucking bottles.</v>

117
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:37.040
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>

118
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.120
<v Speaker 1>you got west state bowling.</v>

119
00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.730
<v Speaker 1>Unless they both went to Dan and say,</v>

120
00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:40.573
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

121
00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:42.150
<v Speaker 1>this jacked up the things.</v>

122
00:03:42.151 --> 00:03:44.730
<v Speaker 1>So I went to see him wanting to SAP UFC,</v>

123
00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:45.590
<v Speaker 1>pick up the tab,</v>

124
00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.490
<v Speaker 1>but then with 300 because it came out of your fucking,</v>

125
00:03:48.491 --> 00:03:50.500
<v Speaker 1>and for the paper views and something,</v>

126
00:03:50.501 --> 00:03:52.390
<v Speaker 1>there's always one 50 is not that bad.</v>

127
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:53.770
<v Speaker 1>They walked away with a ton of loot.</v>

128
00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.731
<v Speaker 1>It's a good point.</v>

129
00:03:54.731 --> 00:03:56.740
<v Speaker 1>There's gotta be some type of repercussion.</v>

130
00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.470
<v Speaker 1>One 50 and they can fight again in November.</v>

131
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:00.220
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

132
00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.790
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

133
00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.460
<v Speaker 1>I got to court without a license 10 15 years ago in la.</v>

134
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.230
<v Speaker 1>First time ever.</v>

135
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.730
<v Speaker 1>It was talking on the phone and I got pulled over,</v>

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.920
<v Speaker 1>It didn't work that day.</v>

139
00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:10.600
<v Speaker 1>I went down to La County.</v>

140
00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.220

144
00:04:19.181 --> 00:04:20.014
<v Speaker 1>want to see you again.</v>

145
00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:22.993
<v Speaker 1>What do you think I did?</v>

146
00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.590
<v Speaker 1>I gave him 200 and game five I gave him five 50 and in time I got my license.</v>

147
00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:28.710
<v Speaker 1>Not with a gun to my head.</v>

148
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:29.783
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

149
00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.960
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you pay a little extra gonna let you fight Melvin Butler.</v>

150
00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.390
<v Speaker 1>Now you earn next time and now you can make up that one 50 you're earning at</v>

151
00:04:38.391 --> 00:04:40.430
<v Speaker 1>least they're not suspend it for fucking a year.</v>

152
00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:41.071
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

153
00:04:41.071 --> 00:04:41.760
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

154
00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:42.060
<v Speaker 1>Here's,</v>

155
00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.893
<v Speaker 1>here's my thought,</v>

156
00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.420
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think 150 is bad.</v>

157
00:04:45.421 --> 00:04:46.800
<v Speaker 1>If you got a good charity for it,</v>

158
00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.420
<v Speaker 1>the of the charity.</v>

159
00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.611
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

160
00:04:48.611 --> 00:04:51.720
<v Speaker 1>Instead of going to an athletic department and what I mean,</v>

161
00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:51.931
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

162
00:04:51.931 --> 00:04:53.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure he has a nice apartment.</v>

163
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.780
<v Speaker 1>His apartment somewhere be a girl's soccer team or something like that for that</v>

164
00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:58.100
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

165
00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.850
<v Speaker 1>That that's like a good thing.</v>

166
00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.390
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

167
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.120
<v Speaker 1>But 300,000 into their pocket is what pisses you off.</v>

168
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.450
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

169
00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:08.450
<v Speaker 1>See what they decide to get mad at and what they don't decide to get mad at.</v>

170
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:09.780
<v Speaker 1>Because this is the thing that I found.</v>

171
00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:11.341
<v Speaker 1>Do you know,</v>

172
00:05:11.341 --> 00:05:13.500
<v Speaker 1>did you watch when Floyd Mayweather was doing,</v>

173
00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.150
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was for showtime.</v>

174
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:20.690
<v Speaker 1>They were doing one of those behind the scenes things at his gym and um,</v>

175
00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.570
<v Speaker 1>he has what he calls doghouse fights.</v>

176
00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.020
<v Speaker 1>And I just,</v>

177
00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:31.110
<v Speaker 1>let me just say that this kind of thing has been going on in Jim's forever,</v>

178
00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.700
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

179
00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:35.700
<v Speaker 1>They've always had gym wars and people have even set up,</v>

180
00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:40.710
<v Speaker 1>and this was a thing that I'm pretty sure it became illegal in California fairly</v>

181
00:05:40.711 --> 00:05:41.371
<v Speaker 1>recently,</v>

182
00:05:41.371 --> 00:05:42.750
<v Speaker 1>within the last decade,</v>

183
00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.040
<v Speaker 1>they stopped allowing people to have what they call smokers and what a smoker</v>

184
00:05:47.041 --> 00:05:47.221
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

185
00:05:47.221 --> 00:05:48.810
<v Speaker 1>They have organized fights.</v>

186
00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:49.770
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

187
00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:53.280
<v Speaker 1>but there's not really like a lot of medical on hand.</v>

188
00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:54.210
<v Speaker 1>They're only gets paid,</v>

189
00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:55.440
<v Speaker 1>nobody gets paid.</v>

190
00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.000
<v Speaker 1>But it gives people experience.</v>

191
00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:59.590
<v Speaker 1>They used to have a lot of them and Moy,</v>

192
00:05:59.591 --> 00:06:00.140
<v Speaker 1>Tai,</v>

193
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:01.190
<v Speaker 1>like I used to go to them,</v>

194
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:01.910
<v Speaker 1>they were cool.</v>

195
00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:04.070
<v Speaker 1>They would set up like these little plastic lawn chairs,</v>

196
00:06:04.071 --> 00:06:05.630
<v Speaker 1>you'd pay a small amount of money,</v>

197
00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:05.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

198
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.490
<v Speaker 1>like 30 bucks or something like that.</v>

199
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.770
<v Speaker 1>And you'd go and you watch all these amateur fights.</v>

200
00:06:09.771 --> 00:06:12.770
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of times kids are pretty fucking talented and it's fun to watch.</v>

201
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.620
<v Speaker 1>But so they've always had organized chimp fights.</v>

202
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:20.270
<v Speaker 1>So essentially what Floyd Mayweather did was have his own,</v>

203
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.330
<v Speaker 1>like in house Jim fights,</v>

204
00:06:23.331 --> 00:06:24.380
<v Speaker 1>like amateur fights.</v>

205
00:06:24.381 --> 00:06:28.070
<v Speaker 1>Like they didn't even disguise the fact that it was a competition.</v>

206
00:06:28.071 --> 00:06:29.600
<v Speaker 1>Like they weren't trying to,</v>

207
00:06:29.601 --> 00:06:30.434
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

208
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:32.120
<v Speaker 1>they weren't trying to spar.</v>

209
00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:34.280
<v Speaker 1>Like these guys are having fights</v>

210
00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.510
<v Speaker 1>and he was talking about how it's to the death.</v>

211
00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:39.710
<v Speaker 1>It's really crazy.</v>

212
00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.490
<v Speaker 1>And he has these guys,</v>

213
00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:48.640
<v Speaker 1>one guy gets beat up and he's Huck Haseem rock bonds brother or son seen Brock</v>

214
00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:52.401
<v Speaker 1>months son.</v>

215
00:06:52.401 --> 00:06:53.234
<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>

216
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:54.860
<v Speaker 1>You see if you could save,</v>

217
00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:58.070
<v Speaker 1>you can Google who the gentleman was saying it was his brother but I was just</v>

218
00:06:58.700 --> 00:06:59.510
<v Speaker 1>his brother.</v>

219
00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:00.470
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's his brother.</v>

220
00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:05.090
<v Speaker 1>That makes more sense cause how seem Rockmont is not that old to have a kid</v>

221
00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:06.700
<v Speaker 1>that's that you know,</v>

222
00:07:06.701 --> 00:07:11.060
<v Speaker 1>like that developed because he looks like he's like in his twenties maybe.</v>

223
00:07:11.061 --> 00:07:11.510
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

224
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:11.841
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

225
00:07:11.841 --> 00:07:16.841
<v Speaker 1>point being so this English guy beats up Haseem Brock bonds one brother and then</v>

226
00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:26.300
<v Speaker 1>the mom comes back with the bigger brother and the English guy fights him too</v>

227
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:32.110
<v Speaker 1>all in the same day and they're fighting like these 30 minute rounds just gets</v>

228
00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:33.133
<v Speaker 1>crazy</v>

229
00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:35.391
<v Speaker 1>cause you're a winner.</v>

230
00:07:35.391 --> 00:07:36.110
<v Speaker 1>And the Lewis,</v>

231
00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:37.430
<v Speaker 1>they put it on TV.</v>

232
00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:37.911
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

233
00:07:37.911 --> 00:07:38.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean dude,</v>

234
00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:39.351
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely,</v>

235
00:07:39.351 --> 00:07:40.184
<v Speaker 1>what are the losers?</v>

236
00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:41.523
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>

237
00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.351
<v Speaker 1>the question was,</v>

238
00:07:42.351 --> 00:07:43.160
<v Speaker 1>is that Jesus?</v>

239
00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:43.371
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

240
00:07:43.371 --> 00:07:44.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there is.</v>

241
00:07:44.241 --> 00:07:44.451
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

242
00:07:44.451 --> 00:07:45.111
<v Speaker 1>there might be,</v>

243
00:07:45.111 --> 00:07:45.351
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

244
00:07:45.351 --> 00:07:48.080
<v Speaker 1>Floyd might reward them or something like that,</v>

245
00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.120
<v Speaker 1>but I mean it's,</v>

246
00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:51.350
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy shit and I mean,</v>

247
00:07:51.351 --> 00:07:51.891
<v Speaker 1>in one way,</v>

248
00:07:51.891 --> 00:07:52.191
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

249
00:07:52.191 --> 00:07:53.120
<v Speaker 1>this'll develop,</v>

250
00:07:53.121 --> 00:07:54.200
<v Speaker 1>develop character.</v>

251
00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:57.560
<v Speaker 1>And I don't have a problem with people doing whatever they decide to do.</v>

252
00:07:57.561 --> 00:07:58.400
<v Speaker 1>If somebody wants a fight,</v>

253
00:07:58.401 --> 00:07:59.330
<v Speaker 1>a 30 minute fight,</v>

254
00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:01.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a problem with that.</v>

255
00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:04.610
<v Speaker 1>You should be able to do it if you want to.</v>

256
00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:07.220
<v Speaker 1>They've been doing this and she's just love Chicago.</v>

257
00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:08.510
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is in Boston,</v>

258
00:08:08.511 --> 00:08:09.560
<v Speaker 1>when you do a brown belt,</v>

259
00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:09.951
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

260
00:08:09.951 --> 00:08:11.150
<v Speaker 1>They way your buddy shoot that.</v>

261
00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:11.870
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

262
00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:12.360
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

263
00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.750
<v Speaker 1>but the thing is I'm not a promoter in Las Vegas.</v>

264
00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:15.020
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

265
00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:15.831
<v Speaker 1>That's a big difference.</v>

266
00:08:15.831 --> 00:08:16.700
<v Speaker 1>It's a big difference.</v>

267
00:08:16.701 --> 00:08:19.760
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not a professional fighter on television.</v>

268
00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:21.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

269
00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:21.891
<v Speaker 1>so I'm,</v>

270
00:08:21.891 --> 00:08:22.221
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

271
00:08:22.221 --> 00:08:22.461
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

272
00:08:22.461 --> 00:08:25.400
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not necessarily saying there's anything wrong with what he did because</v>

273
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:27.350
<v Speaker 1>it is a part of gym culture.</v>

274
00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:29.600
<v Speaker 1>It is a part of what's made champions.</v>

275
00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean this kind of stuff,</v>

276
00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:32.391
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

277
00:08:32.391 --> 00:08:33.021
<v Speaker 1>this heat,</v>

278
00:08:33.021 --> 00:08:38.021
<v Speaker 1>these heated battles is this uncomfortable reality that elite fighters like</v>

279
00:08:38.841 --> 00:08:42.500
<v Speaker 1>Floyd Mayweather face like to be that good,</v>

280
00:08:42.501 --> 00:08:44.180
<v Speaker 1>you have to be that real.</v>

281
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:49.630
<v Speaker 1>And for a guy like him to show like these kind of crazy 30 minute,</v>

282
00:08:50.271 --> 00:08:53.240
<v Speaker 1>no time limit fights in the gym and put it on TV,</v>

283
00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:55.800
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty wild is in,</v>

284
00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:57.210
<v Speaker 1>and I see both sides of it.</v>

285
00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.950
<v Speaker 1>I totally see Floyd made with the side of it.</v>

286
00:08:58.951 --> 00:08:59.371
<v Speaker 1>Look at him,</v>

287
00:08:59.371 --> 00:09:00.330
<v Speaker 1>he feeds off that.</v>

288
00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:01.530
<v Speaker 1>But guess what?</v>

289
00:09:01.531 --> 00:09:06.531
<v Speaker 1>That mentality is why that motherfucker was 49 and [inaudible] right?</v>

290
00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:09.910
<v Speaker 1>That mother is arguably the best box forever.</v>

291
00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:10.470
<v Speaker 1>Who,</v>

292
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:15.470
<v Speaker 1>who got hurt less than Floyd Mayweather who box people's face off that everybody</v>

293
00:09:16.051 --> 00:09:18.000
<v Speaker 1>thought it was going to kill him better than Floyd Mayweather.</v>

294
00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:23.120
<v Speaker 1>Remember when he fought my Donna and he found him the first time and um,</v>

295
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:23.341
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

296
00:09:23.341 --> 00:09:26.520
<v Speaker 1>Donna caught him in one of the exchanges like right before the bell rang.</v>

297
00:09:26.521 --> 00:09:26.881
<v Speaker 1>We were like,</v>

298
00:09:26.881 --> 00:09:27.714
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

299
00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:32.520
<v Speaker 1>And then they fought again the second time and he just put a clinic on my,</v>

300
00:09:32.521 --> 00:09:34.260
<v Speaker 1>Donna just put a clinic on them.</v>

301
00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.350
<v Speaker 1>It's like all of a sudden my Donald was finding a totally different guy.</v>

302
00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:42.530
<v Speaker 1>Like Floyd had figured out my Donna's style or decided not to fuck around this</v>

303
00:09:42.631 --> 00:09:43.800
<v Speaker 1>fight and decided,</v>

304
00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:44.221
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

305
00:09:44.221 --> 00:09:45.540
<v Speaker 1>to really take him seriously.</v>

306
00:09:45.541 --> 00:09:48.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm really focused on him and he just beat his ass.</v>

307
00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:49.890
<v Speaker 1>He different things.</v>

308
00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:52.190

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:16.441
<v Speaker 1>I would love him.</v>

326
00:10:16.441 --> 00:10:17.274
<v Speaker 1>He's a psycho.</v>

327
00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.870
<v Speaker 1>He wants to fight like three times.</v>

328
00:10:18.871 --> 00:10:19.141
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

329
00:10:19.141 --> 00:10:21.180
<v Speaker 1>you know what the proof was in the motherfucking pudding.</v>

330
00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:21.991
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

331
00:10:21.991 --> 00:10:22.530
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

332
00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:23.460
<v Speaker 1>Exactly is in the pudding.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Let them do whatever the fuck he wants.</v>

334
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:25.670
<v Speaker 1>You don't,</v>

335
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:28.110
<v Speaker 1>you don't get a guy like that unless he's a guy like that.</v>

336
00:10:28.111 --> 00:10:29.570

338
00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:35.190
<v Speaker 1>but I think he handles it as good as any fucking human being that could be in</v>

339
00:10:35.191 --> 00:10:35.761

404
00:12:38.861 --> 00:12:42.940
<v Speaker 1>I just want to be clear about all that stuff that I was saying about the Floyd</v>

405
00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:43.390
<v Speaker 1>Mayweather thing.</v>

406
00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:44.260

407
00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:47.410
<v Speaker 1>athletic commissions,</v>

409
00:12:47.981 --> 00:12:51.220
<v Speaker 1>like when they find people and when they get mad at people for stuff,</v>

410
00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:53.860
<v Speaker 1>it's like sometimes they,</v>

411
00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:56.230
<v Speaker 1>they do it in a very heavy handed way,</v>

412
00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.090
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's kind of obscene.</v>

413
00:12:58.590 --> 00:12:59.423
<v Speaker 2>Like</v>

414
