<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan podcast by night all day is,</v>

4
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.660
<v Speaker 1>I think I remember you're seeing short careers anyways.</v>

5
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:08.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:08.851
<v Speaker 1>Like to me this,</v>

7
00:00:08.851 --> 00:00:11.310
<v Speaker 1>this and I feel the same way as you guys do with,</v>

8
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.300
<v Speaker 1>it's sad the way Rhonda lost what's not that sad because she had such a great</v>

9
00:00:15.301 --> 00:00:15.720
<v Speaker 1>run.</v>

10
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:16.553
<v Speaker 1>She was a pioneer.</v>

11
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.710
<v Speaker 1>She was on the Mount Rushmore of MMA in general.</v>

12
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.700
<v Speaker 1>She goes on Mount restaurant.</v>

13
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.170
<v Speaker 1>It's really not that sad.</v>

14
00:00:22.171 --> 00:00:23.190
<v Speaker 1>Like God damn,</v>

00:00:23.191 --> 00:00:24.960
<v Speaker 1>what are iconic run man.</v>

16
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.920
<v Speaker 1>Sad is like you've got like more coalminer or a guy like if Mark Hunt word</v>

17
00:00:28.921 --> 00:00:29.641
<v Speaker 1>retire like that.</v>

18
00:00:29.641 --> 00:00:31.500
<v Speaker 1>Sad people don't have money and fame.</v>

19
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.640
<v Speaker 1>She set man.</v>

20
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:33.780
<v Speaker 1>It's not that sad.</v>

21
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.400
<v Speaker 1>She did some great shit.</v>

22
00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:36.234
<v Speaker 1>A great things.</v>

23
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.070
<v Speaker 1>You know what's interesting here is going on,</v>

24
00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:39.660
<v Speaker 1>it's like the Ronda fans,</v>

25
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:40.440
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

26
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.870
<v Speaker 1>they're not MMA fans.</v>

27
00:00:42.871 --> 00:00:43.650
<v Speaker 1>A lot of them,</v>

28
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.550
<v Speaker 1>they're Ronda fans and so like you see how they respond to stuff on Twitter and</v>

29
00:00:47.551 --> 00:00:50.280
<v Speaker 1>you see like the reaction of the things that they're saying.</v>

30
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.720
<v Speaker 1>Like it's pretty emotional.</v>

31
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:52.740
<v Speaker 1>It's very emotional.</v>

32
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.170
<v Speaker 1>It's also almost like they don't understand.</v>

33
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.610
<v Speaker 1>They don't understand the sport.</v>

34
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.180
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

35
00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.070
<v Speaker 1>get back on the horse.</v>

36
00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.231
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

37
00:00:58.231 --> 00:00:58.381

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.631
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

00:01:00.631 --> 00:01:01.464
<v Speaker 1>listen to your mom,</v>

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.441

00:01:06.781 --> 00:01:07.500
<v Speaker 1>She says,</v>

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.951
<v Speaker 1>she goes,</v>

54
00:01:07.951 --> 00:01:09.960
<v Speaker 1>go let stupid people get punched in the face.</v>

55
00:01:09.961 --> 00:01:10.231
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

56
00:01:10.231 --> 00:01:10.970
<v Speaker 1>Stupid people.</v>

57
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:11.130
<v Speaker 1>Her,</v>

58
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.520
<v Speaker 1>her mom,</v>

59
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.630
<v Speaker 1>her mom's brilliant and she's a doctor and the good thing for Rhonda to add all</v>

60
00:01:15.631 --> 00:01:18.180
<v Speaker 1>of this is she's going to find out who's in her corner.</v>

61
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.700
<v Speaker 1>There's been,</v>

62
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:19.321
<v Speaker 1>there's been so many.</v>

63
00:01:19.321 --> 00:01:19.800
<v Speaker 1>Yes men.</v>

64
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.700
<v Speaker 1>You know how it is in Holland.</v>

65
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.020
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing when you're on set,</v>

66
00:01:22.021 --> 00:01:24.210
<v Speaker 1>you know bullshit is your agents.</v>

67
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.700
<v Speaker 1>These other people you're working with these other celebrities,</v>

68
00:01:26.701 --> 00:01:26.911
<v Speaker 1>Tony,</v>

69
00:01:26.911 --> 00:01:27.680
<v Speaker 1>all good Ui.</v>

70
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.300
<v Speaker 1>Well now when you lose that,</v>

71
00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.440
<v Speaker 1>that phone stops ringing and the tech stop coming.</v>

72
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.160
<v Speaker 1>Everyone asks you to Denver.</v>

73
00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.010
<v Speaker 1>That stuff you're going to find out who's in your corner.</v>

74
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.880
<v Speaker 1>That's probably,</v>

75
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.020
<v Speaker 1>they might be good for now.</v>

76
00:01:37.021 --> 00:01:37.854
<v Speaker 1>Let me ask you,</v>

77
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.300
<v Speaker 1>do the last two years,</v>

78
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.080
<v Speaker 1>because I heard they cut a one and the other one disappeared.</v>

79
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:44.191
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

80
00:01:44.191 --> 00:01:45.450
<v Speaker 1>Who knows what kind of deal she has,</v>

81
00:01:45.451 --> 00:01:48.870
<v Speaker 1>but things definitely dried up substantially after the Holly knockout because</v>

82
00:01:48.871 --> 00:01:50.160
<v Speaker 1>she's not the same person anymore.</v>

83
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.660
<v Speaker 1>The thing about all those deals is when you're a winner in Hollywood and they</v>

84
00:01:54.661 --> 00:01:58.440
<v Speaker 1>start throwing all these movies at you and you're some athletes coming over,</v>

85
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.590
<v Speaker 1>it's all predicated on you being that person that they're selling,</v>

86
00:02:01.591 --> 00:02:02.040
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

87
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.701
<v Speaker 1>What are they selling?</v>

88
00:02:02.701 --> 00:02:05.130
<v Speaker 1>They're selling this undefeated women's ass kicker.</v>

89
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.701
<v Speaker 1>The likes,</v>

90
00:02:05.701 --> 00:02:06.600
<v Speaker 1>if you've never seen before,</v>

91
00:02:06.601 --> 00:02:07.050
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

92
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.070
<v Speaker 1>Throwing people in their head,</v>

93
00:02:08.071 --> 00:02:08.910
<v Speaker 1>get him in an arm bar.</v>

94
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:09.840
<v Speaker 1>That's what they're selling.</v>

95
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.471
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

96
00:02:10.471 --> 00:02:11.580
<v Speaker 1>that's not you anymore.</v>

97
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.110
<v Speaker 1>Now you just got smashed by Holly and then smashed again by a man and they can't</v>

98
00:02:16.111 --> 00:02:20.000
<v Speaker 1>sell your acting abilities to,</v>

99
00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.280
<v Speaker 1>she'd be waiting to,</v>

100
00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.500
<v Speaker 1>she'd do roadhouse.</v>

101
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.500
<v Speaker 1>Did she redo roadhouse done?</v>

102
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:26.191
<v Speaker 1>They killed.</v>

103
00:02:26.191 --> 00:02:27.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about any of that stuff.</v>

104
00:02:27.381 --> 00:02:27.470
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

105
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:28.400
<v Speaker 1>I just know to,</v>

106
00:02:28.401 --> 00:02:30.160
<v Speaker 1>to his point where they're,</v>

107
00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.940
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

108
00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.700
<v Speaker 1>it's almost a good thing for it.</v>

109
00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:33.451
<v Speaker 1>It really is,</v>

110
00:02:33.451 --> 00:02:33.750
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

111
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:34.830
<v Speaker 1>It's not a sad story.</v>

112
00:02:34.831 --> 00:02:36.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't find it as a sad story.</v>

113
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.230
<v Speaker 1>I really don't.</v>

114
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.441
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

115
00:02:37.441 --> 00:02:39.060
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely sad and she was an angel.</v>

116
00:02:39.061 --> 00:02:40.240
<v Speaker 1>It's not the sadness.</v>

117
00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.220
<v Speaker 1>When she disappeared,</v>

118
00:02:41.221 --> 00:02:42.054
<v Speaker 1>Bro,</v>

119
00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.961
<v Speaker 1>she came,</v>

120
00:02:42.961 --> 00:02:43.160
<v Speaker 1>goes,</v>

121
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.580
<v Speaker 1>she leaves it all that much different.</v>

122
00:02:44.581 --> 00:02:46.390
<v Speaker 1>Do we feel safe for tiger woods like that?</v>

123
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.801
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>

124
00:02:46.801 --> 00:02:47.940
<v Speaker 1>when that foundation rocks,</v>

125
00:02:47.941 --> 00:02:50.040
<v Speaker 1>like what do you think's different with Tiger's swing?</v>

126
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.601
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

127
00:02:50.601 --> 00:02:51.434
<v Speaker 1>the difference.</v>

128
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.390
<v Speaker 1>You can get the fuck beat out of them and 48 seconds.</v>

129
00:02:54.391 --> 00:02:55.470
<v Speaker 1>I know and that's fighting,</v>

130
00:02:55.471 --> 00:03:00.471
<v Speaker 1>but what I'm saying is there hadn't mentality changes when tiger on stoppable he</v>

131
00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:01.360
<v Speaker 1>something happened.</v>

132
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.170
<v Speaker 1>He's had that.</v>

133
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.520
<v Speaker 1>He had the the scandal.</v>

134
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.790
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

135
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.190
<v Speaker 1>but then he also has some significant back injuries.</v>

136
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.641
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

137
00:03:06.641 --> 00:03:09.100
<v Speaker 1>Or what our K for better example to your fight example.</v>

138
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.993
<v Speaker 1>Mike Tyson.</v>

139
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.541
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

140
00:03:10.541 --> 00:03:11.980
<v Speaker 1>That's also wear and tear too,</v>

141
00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.823
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

142
00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.291
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

143
00:03:13.291 --> 00:03:17.080
<v Speaker 1>You can say that for Rhonda tickets waiting to tell you why.</v>

144
00:03:17.081 --> 00:03:17.531
<v Speaker 1>I can say that.</v>

145
00:03:17.531 --> 00:03:20.620
<v Speaker 1>One of the reasons why is because the driver that I had this weekend in Vegas</v>

146
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.610
<v Speaker 1>that took me to the airport was Mike Tyson's driver for 17 years.</v>

147
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.500
<v Speaker 1>I had a long conversation.</v>

148
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:27.311
<v Speaker 1>Cool Dude.</v>

149
00:03:27.311 --> 00:03:29.050
<v Speaker 1>I wish I could remember his fucking name.</v>

150
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.660
<v Speaker 1>I only met him for that brief brief ride to the airport,</v>

151
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.930
<v Speaker 1>but he was telling me how fucked up Tyson was after the Lennox Lewis fight.</v>

152
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.711
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

153
00:03:35.711 --> 00:03:35.921
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

154
00:03:35.921 --> 00:03:39.960
<v Speaker 1>Lennox Lewis hit Mike and Mike was fucked up for a long time for shit.</v>

155
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.400
<v Speaker 1>And you don't think that you watch a guy get knocked out,</v>

156
00:03:42.401 --> 00:03:43.480
<v Speaker 1>you watch guy get stopped.</v>

157
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.051
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

158
00:03:44.051 --> 00:03:46.000
<v Speaker 1>Mike was talking after the fight and he was like,</v>

159
00:03:46.001 --> 00:03:46.301
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

160
00:03:46.301 --> 00:03:46.820
<v Speaker 1>you know I'm,</v>

161
00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:47.501
<v Speaker 1>I'm done.</v>

162
00:03:47.501 --> 00:03:49.420
<v Speaker 1>It's over and eaten a step back.</v>

163
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.260
<v Speaker 1>But when he goes home and he's alone and the cameras are off and he's got</v>

164
00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.930
<v Speaker 1>vertigo and he's got equilibrium problems and his ears won't stop ringing in his</v>

165
00:04:00.941 --> 00:04:01.241
<v Speaker 1>head,</v>

166
00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:02.380
<v Speaker 1>won't stop throbbing.</v>

167
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.630
<v Speaker 1>You don't see that he's doing interviews.</v>

168
00:04:04.631 --> 00:04:06.610
<v Speaker 1>His head's throb and his ears are ringing.</v>

169
00:04:06.611 --> 00:04:07.780
<v Speaker 1>There was no internet back then.</v>

170
00:04:07.781 --> 00:04:08.260
<v Speaker 1>It's harder.</v>

171
00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.210
<v Speaker 1>It's harder to hide nowadays.</v>

172
00:04:10.211 --> 00:04:10.900
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

173
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:11.170
<v Speaker 1>Hard.</v>

174
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.120
<v Speaker 1>You've got your daily thing that you do and everybody,</v>

175
00:04:13.121 --> 00:04:15.760
<v Speaker 1>you got your followers and they all know your daily thing and you guys are doing</v>

176
00:04:15.761 --> 00:04:16.720
<v Speaker 1>the daily things.</v>

177
00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:18.470
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden he disappeared.</v>

178
00:04:18.471 --> 00:04:20.350
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knows he disappeared and back then,</v>

179
00:04:20.351 --> 00:04:21.790
<v Speaker 1>no one really knew you lost the fight.</v>

180
00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.220
<v Speaker 1>You never really see him again.</v>

181
00:04:23.221 --> 00:04:24.580
<v Speaker 1>Like when he was also like,</v>

182
00:04:24.581 --> 00:04:26.080
<v Speaker 1>when you're suffering alone,</v>

183
00:04:26.081 --> 00:04:28.660
<v Speaker 1>the only way people find out is if you talk about it.</v>

184
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.080
<v Speaker 1>Like we don't know what happens to a lot of these guys after they get beat the</v>

185
00:04:32.081 --> 00:04:32.914
<v Speaker 1>fuck up.</v>

186
00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.530
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
