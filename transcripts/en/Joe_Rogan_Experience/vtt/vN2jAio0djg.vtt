6
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.273
<v Speaker 1>Greg and I were just talking about Greg </v>
<v Speaker 1>for people don't know Greg Fitzsimmons </v>

7
00:00:16.711 --> 00:00:19.050
<v Speaker 1>and I have been friends for like 28 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

8
00:00:19.051 --> 00:00:23.430
<v Speaker 1>28 years to roll his fucking God damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked.</v>

9
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:25.283
<v Speaker 1>We started out as raw open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Miker is almost exactly at the same </v>

10
00:00:28.381 --> 00:00:29.940
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

11
00:00:29.941 --> 00:00:32.010
<v Speaker 1>but I was dreaming about it since I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>a kid.</v>

12
00:00:32.011 --> 00:00:32.844
<v Speaker 1>When did you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when did you think that it might be </v>

13
00:00:34.081 --> 00:00:34.914
<v Speaker 1>something you want to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I was grabbing microphones when </v>

14
00:00:36.781 --> 00:00:39.360
<v Speaker 1>I was fucking eight telling jokes into </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

15
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.190
<v Speaker 1>No Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>

16
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.520
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't until I was like 21,</v>

17
00:00:44.521 --> 00:00:45.354
<v Speaker 1>like right before I did it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like maybe 20 or 21 and one of the </v>

18
00:00:48.811 --> 00:00:52.110
<v Speaker 1>reasons for it is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy still a good friend of mine.</v>

19
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.943
<v Speaker 1>His name's Steve Graham.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was an ophthalmologist and he was </v>

20
00:00:55.021 --> 00:00:59.850
<v Speaker 1>this guy who was just this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's such a fucking wild man.</v>

21
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.560
<v Speaker 1>Like I've met some people that purport,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they look sort of pretend to be wildman.</v>

22
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.170
<v Speaker 1>This guy is the wildest dude I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>met my life.</v>

23
00:01:07.171 --> 00:01:09.210
<v Speaker 1>Put a super smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super nice guy.</v>

24
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.050
<v Speaker 1>And he was on the US ski team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

25
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.630
<v Speaker 1>And when he described his key run that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he did to make the team,</v>

26
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.750
<v Speaker 1>he said like at any moment in time I </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have crashed at any single,</v>

27
00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:19.593
<v Speaker 1>just like I barely hung on the whole way</v>
<v Speaker 1>and had this ridiculous time that I </v>

28
00:01:22.111 --> 00:01:24.240
<v Speaker 1>could never do again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was like laughing about it.</v>

29
00:01:24.241 --> 00:01:27.540
<v Speaker 1>But dude had like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna fuck this up Steve,</v>

30
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:28.403
<v Speaker 1>you hear this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he had 25 knee surgeries on his </v>

31
00:01:31.051 --> 00:01:34.140
<v Speaker 1>knees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His knees were insane.</v>

32
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.633
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His knees got to the point where they </v>

33
00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:39.870
<v Speaker 1>had to resurface them.</v>

34
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.110
<v Speaker 1>So the top of his knees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't have any cartilage anymore.</v>

35
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:44.063
<v Speaker 1>So there's a steel cap that they put on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the top of his knees and then there's </v>

36
00:01:46.831 --> 00:01:50.700
<v Speaker 1>like this artificial meniscus in there </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it rolls up and down and he has like</v>

37
00:01:50.701 --> 00:01:53.070
<v Speaker 1>a very limited range of motion with his </v>
<v Speaker 1>knees.</v>

38
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.320
<v Speaker 1>He's in his man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to say he probably has 60.</v>

39
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.640
<v Speaker 1>He's still spars all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's almost legally blind,</v>

40
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:03.503
<v Speaker 1>like he has to have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he's been hitting the head so many </v>

41
00:02:05.221 --> 00:02:07.260
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has to have these,</v>

42
00:02:07.261 --> 00:02:09.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these things that go over his glasses so</v>

43
00:02:09.991 --> 00:02:10.824
<v Speaker 1>he could see better because he said a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of ice surgeries hitting the head </v>

44
00:02:12.631 --> 00:02:14.520
<v Speaker 1>from skiing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from sparring.</v>

45
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.390
<v Speaker 1>He's still spars all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's super fucking smart,</v>

46
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.830
<v Speaker 1>but he doesn't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he's like,</v>

47
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.370
<v Speaker 1>he goes on my hair for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just here for a good time.</v>

48
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.380
<v Speaker 1>He'll laugh at you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he used to be a flight surgeon.</v>

49
00:02:25.381 --> 00:02:26.214
<v Speaker 1>He's a fucking amnesty from a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he was originally from upstate </v>

50
00:02:30.301 --> 00:02:31.134
<v Speaker 1>New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's one of the very few people that </v>

51
00:02:32.611 --> 00:02:36.600
<v Speaker 1>told me a Ufo story and I had to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>

52
00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.240
<v Speaker 1>because this dude just doesn't make shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

53
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.630
<v Speaker 1>And he's done everything maniac.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I met him,</v>

54
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.540
<v Speaker 1>he was a learning taekwondo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Immediately became obsessed,</v>

55
00:02:45.541 --> 00:02:48.240
<v Speaker 1>want to start fighting immediately while</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a resident.</v>

56
00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:49.323
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was going through his residency for </v>

57
00:02:49.951 --> 00:02:52.290
<v Speaker 1>ophthalmology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be sitting on the toilet.</v>

58
00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.480
<v Speaker 1>He told me sitting on the toilet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating lunch,</v>

59
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.780
<v Speaker 1>and as he fell asleep while I was taking</v>
<v Speaker 1>a shit and his pager went off,</v>

60
00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:58.850
<v Speaker 1>will come up.</v>

61
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.590

<v Speaker 2>operating room when you're laying on the</v>

62
00:03:05.591 --> 00:03:06.940
<v Speaker 2>table.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a student guys.</v>

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.410
<v Speaker 2>GotTa fucking Dukie and his cheeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has enough time to wipe it out.</v>

64
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.410
<v Speaker 2>You were always on call.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're always working,</v>

65
00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.263
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had two friends that went through the </v>

66
00:03:16.151 --> 00:03:18.550
<v Speaker 2>residency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My other friend was a Korean friend.</v>

67
00:03:18.551 --> 00:03:20.500
<v Speaker 2>His name was junk and junk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sick.</v>

68
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:21.423
<v Speaker 2>He actually won the nationals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He won the US national championship </v>

69
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.410
<v Speaker 2>while he was in medical school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Taekwondo,</v>

70
00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.610
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

71
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.510
<v Speaker 2>He was a beast and he was never like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>really physically talented guy.</v>

72
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.840
<v Speaker 2>He was just unbelievably determined and </v>
<v Speaker 2>super smart and not.</v>

73
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.233
<v Speaker 2>It's not that he was physically inept,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he didn't have any amazing </v>

74
00:03:40.061 --> 00:03:43.330
<v Speaker 2>attributes like sign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some fighters just have amazing physical</v>

75
00:03:43.331 --> 00:03:45.100
<v Speaker 2>attributes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Plus he could always.</v>

76
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.370
<v Speaker 2>He could already count to 10 in Korean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he was like ahead of the class.</v>

77
00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.570
<v Speaker 2>He was also like super humble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was really weird.</v>

78
00:03:52.571 --> 00:03:53.404
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were talking about a dude who won </v>

79
00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.640
<v Speaker 2>the national championship and when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>would ask him about it,</v>

80
00:03:57.641 --> 00:03:58.840
<v Speaker 2>he would always say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

81
00:03:58.841 --> 00:03:59.674
<v Speaker 2>I Suck a fucking terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't even believe that I win these </v>

82
00:04:02.321 --> 00:04:03.154
<v Speaker 2>fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like who would just joke around about </v>

83
00:04:04.331 --> 00:04:05.830
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>

84
00:04:05.831 --> 00:04:08.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put you in this category is I'm amazed</v>

85
00:04:08.801 --> 00:04:11.830
<v Speaker 2>by some people's energy because I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>always had,</v>

86
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.410
<v Speaker 2>I think as I have depression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have mild depression,</v>

87
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:15.363
<v Speaker 2>medicated for it and my whole life I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>struggled to manage my energy and to </v>

88
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:20.373
<v Speaker 2>focus it and pick what I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it is I need to accomplish and put </v>

89
00:04:23.141 --> 00:04:26.470
<v Speaker 2>my energy on that and let go of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that keep it simple.</v>

90
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.360
<v Speaker 2>Just keep it simple and I look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody like,</v>

91
00:04:28.361 --> 00:04:29.194
<v Speaker 2>you are talking about this guy and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>mean you already did a three hour </v>

92
00:04:32.021 --> 00:04:33.250
<v Speaker 2>fucking podcast today.</v>

93
00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.680
<v Speaker 2>You're sitting down with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>

94
00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.150
<v Speaker 2>we're seven minutes into another three </v>
<v Speaker 2>hour podcasts.</v>

95
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.490
<v Speaker 2>You probably already worked out today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

96
00:04:39.491 --> 00:04:42.070
<v Speaker 2>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I had a food poisoning.</v>

97
00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.920
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I was telling you before,</v>

99
00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.430
<v Speaker 2>but it's just amazing to me how we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>all built differently and when you gain,</v>

100
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.340
<v Speaker 2>when you gauge success,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

101
00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all are dealing with a different tool</v>

102
00:04:53.891 --> 00:04:54.724
<v Speaker 2>belts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of us have this unlimited energy </v>

103
00:04:56.171 --> 00:04:57.004
<v Speaker 2>and focus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some have adhd and somehow those things </v>

104
00:04:59.891 --> 00:05:04.891
<v Speaker 2>that fuck you up can make you stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm sure this things about you that</v>

105
00:05:04.991 --> 00:05:05.824
<v Speaker 2>are did maybe you didn't do well in </v>
<v Speaker 2>school because of that made you </v>

106
00:05:08.681 --> 00:05:10.780
<v Speaker 2>successful in life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

107
00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:11.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent.</v>

108
00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:13.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

109
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:14.433
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never been a very disciplined </v>

110
00:05:15.401 --> 00:05:16.480
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe it or not,</v>

111
00:05:16.481 --> 00:05:18.700
<v Speaker 2>but you've always had the energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I've always been driven,</v>

112
00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.240
<v Speaker 2>like I find things that obsess on and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's not a discipline thing.</v>

113
00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.073
<v Speaker 2>It's a matter of like almost like </v>
<v Speaker 2>limiting my amount of time that I'm </v>

114
00:05:25.511 --> 00:05:26.770
<v Speaker 2>doing them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when I,</v>

115
00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:28.990
<v Speaker 2>like when I was doing taekwondo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was competing,</v>

116
00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.620
<v Speaker 2>who was never an issue of I got to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>disciplined and show up to train.</v>

117
00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.320
<v Speaker 2>It was the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like I was training all day.</v>

118
00:05:35.321 --> 00:05:37.720
<v Speaker 2>I was constantly training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was obsessed,</v>

119
00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:39.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

120
00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.770
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is like if you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

121
00:05:41.771 --> 00:05:43.650
<v Speaker 2>you have to go do your taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

122
00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.220
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't do it.</v>

123
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.980
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you told me that I had to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be an accountant,</v>

124
00:05:47.981 --> 00:05:48.551
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

125
00:05:48.551 --> 00:05:49.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm too stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't do it.</v>

126
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.933
<v Speaker 2>I just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't focus on anything I don't want </v>

127
00:05:52.841 --> 00:05:53.674
<v Speaker 2>to focus on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Getting a business manager was like the </v>

128
00:05:55.301 --> 00:05:56.950
<v Speaker 2>greatest thing that ever happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's huge.</v>

129
00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:58.003
<v Speaker 2>It's also like</v>

130
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.190
<v Speaker 1>picking something for a living that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually enjoy doing.</v>

131
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:02.083
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a lot of people that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>tortured out there that really are </v>

132
00:06:04.221 --> 00:06:05.054
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be like a bike maker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're supposed to make fucking </v>

133
00:06:07.191 --> 00:06:08.024
<v Speaker 1>motorcycles or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but instead they got sucked into some </v>

134
00:06:10.611 --> 00:06:13.430
<v Speaker 1>insurance job and they don't give a fuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it and they're just trying to sell</v>

135
00:06:13.431 --> 00:06:17.640
<v Speaker 1>policies and it's just a grind on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>soul every day.</v>

136
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:18.763
<v Speaker 1>You and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what we talking about before the </v>

137
00:06:19.371 --> 00:06:21.190
<v Speaker 1>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how lucky we are at all,</v>

138
00:06:21.191 --> 00:06:25.320
<v Speaker 1>all these years that we've known each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other like we were fucking common.</v>

139
00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what we always wanted,</v>

140
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.940
<v Speaker 1>but we didn't even know we wanted this</v>

141
00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:31.230
<v Speaker 3>and it's and when I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like people say to me,</v>

<v Speaker 3>walk out.</v>

201
00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:50.960
<v Speaker 3>I tell I can't be anywhere near.</v>

<v Speaker 3>My balls smell like a fart.</v>

203
00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:58.140
<v Speaker 3>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's how,</v>

204
00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:02.220
<v Speaker 3>that's how she ended up anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a couple of nuggets later.</v>

205
00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.310
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like where do I don't say that,</v>

206
00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.860
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's Just too and too strong.</v>

207
00:09:07.861 --> 00:09:10.560
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I'm working on the road,</v>

208
00:09:10.561 --> 00:09:14.670
<v Speaker 3>I'll watch both comics that the opener </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the m and the feature act.</v>

209
00:09:14.671 --> 00:09:16.170
<v Speaker 3>I'll watch them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>number one.</v>

210
00:09:16.171 --> 00:09:20.220
<v Speaker 3>so I don't do any of the same premises.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And number two,</v>

211
00:09:20.221 --> 00:09:23.190
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I owe it to them because a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of them will say,</v>

212
00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:24.203
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I asked to work with you three months </v>

213
00:09:26.011 --> 00:09:26.371

215
00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:31.343

00:09:32.371 --> 00:09:34.860
<v Speaker 3>responsibility to watch their act and </v>

<v Speaker 3>limos would pull up and they double park</v>

253
00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:00.293
<v Speaker 3>and these guys in overcoats would go out</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they'd go onto this little fucking </v>

254
00:11:02.371 --> 00:11:02.790
<v Speaker 3>club.</v>

255
00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:03.623
<v Speaker 3>Oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'd Walk up and down the street </v>

256
00:11:04.981 --> 00:11:05.814
<v Speaker 3>because they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

257
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.900
<v Speaker 3>the place was wiretapped the raven night</v>
<v Speaker 3>social club was,</v>

258
00:11:09.901 --> 00:11:13.860
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where all the deals went down for the,</v>

259
00:11:13.861 --> 00:11:15.440
<v Speaker 3>there's the gambinos right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got it.</v>

260
00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:18.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they started walking.</v>

261
00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:19.043
<v Speaker 3>They knew the place was wire tapped so </v>
<v Speaker 3>they would walk down the street down </v>

262
00:11:21.781 --> 00:11:26.781
<v Speaker 3>mulberry street in groups and they talk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the fbi started inserting,</v>

263
00:11:27.001 --> 00:11:27.834
<v Speaker 3>they would park cars on the street and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd put wire taps in the hubcaps of </v>

264
00:11:31.311 --> 00:11:32.570
<v Speaker 3>the cars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

265
00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:35.580
<v Speaker 3>And they would pick up the conversation </v>
<v Speaker 3>as they walked up and down the street.</v>

266
00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:36.963
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we moved into this place and it </v>

267
00:11:40.111 --> 00:11:44.910
<v Speaker 3>was a tony and gladys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a six floor walk up.</v>

268
00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.820
<v Speaker 3>No fucking joke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so if you're on the sixth floor,</v>

269
00:11:47.821 --> 00:11:48.654
<v Speaker 3>you have to carry your couch six while </v>
<v Speaker 3>we didn't have to because we moved in </v>

270
00:11:51.631 --> 00:11:54.010
<v Speaker 3>and we took,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they gave us what their part is,</v>

271
00:11:54.011 --> 00:11:57.310
<v Speaker 3>all italian couple and we move in and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they uh,</v>

272
00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:59.680
<v Speaker 3>they had uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was an illegal sublet.</v>

273
00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:03.950
<v Speaker 3>So we move in and they've got the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking couches with the plastic on them</v>

274
00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:06.970
<v Speaker 3>and the little end tables.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's craIg's barrett is,</v>

275
00:12:06.971 --> 00:12:09.310
<v Speaker 3>that's my fucking apartment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What floor were you on?</v>

276
00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:11.500
<v Speaker 3>Sixth floor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh shit.</v>

277
00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:12.850
<v Speaker 3>Oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess it's five.</v>

278
00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:15.820
<v Speaker 3>Five floors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you didn't have an elevator.</v>

279
00:12:15.821 --> 00:12:19.180
<v Speaker 3>You had to walk all the way out so fast </v>
<v Speaker 3>and there was no buzzer.</v>

280
00:12:19.181 --> 00:12:22.060
<v Speaker 3>So you'd go out on the fire escape and </v>
<v Speaker 3>throw the keys down below.</v>

281
00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:25.450
<v Speaker 3>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So someone would ring your doorbell.</v>

282
00:12:25.451 --> 00:12:25.950
<v Speaker 3>Yo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

283
00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:27.730

<v Speaker 3>You don't have to drop it on their head.</v>

284
00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:28.583
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But how many times did the key like hit </v>

285
00:12:29.921 --> 00:12:31.270
<v Speaker 3>the ground?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think after a while it wouldn't be.</v>

286
00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:35.640
<v Speaker 3>You put it in a Sock dude be rolling up </v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

288
00:12:37.061 --> 00:12:39.100
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we want to live there for like a day,</v>

289
00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:40.740

<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

290
00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:45.160
<v Speaker 3>we move in and so we got all this </v>
<v Speaker 3>plastic furniture and then uh,</v>

291
00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:47.920
<v Speaker 3>and it had a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

292
00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:49.300
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the end table.</v>

293
00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:51.760
<v Speaker 3>I open it up and there's um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shell casings,</v>

294
00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:56.030
<v Speaker 3>shell casings from a gun ho.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there was a wire to do was uh,</v>

295
00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:57.063
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a device to listen to record your phone </v>

296

<v Speaker 3>like they were all somewhat in the </v>

<v Speaker 3>mafia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They weren't necessarily getting paid,</v>

298
00:13:05.471 --> 00:13:09.640
<v Speaker 3>but like everybody was like running </v>
<v Speaker 3>numbers with their friends and involved.</v>

299
00:13:09.641 --> 00:13:11.800
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody ever bothers you?</v>

<v Speaker 3>And so they got a condo around the </v>

304
00:13:21.521 --> 00:13:22.354
<v Speaker 3>corner because their son gregory was in </v>

<v Speaker 3>That was nice.</v>

306
00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:32.110
<v Speaker 3>And then we paid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We paid $700 a month in rent.</v>

<v Speaker 3>sit down with them,</v>

<v Speaker 3>getting the to.</v>

317
00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:07.623
<v Speaker 3>Tony had no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He told me don't need to know about my </v>

318
00:14:09.011 --> 00:14:14.011
<v Speaker 3>bingo money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was so behind me to keep that secret.</v>

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:15.371
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gladys.</v>

320
00:14:15.371 --> 00:14:17.060
<v Speaker 3>I'll go to the grave with the secret </v>
<v Speaker 3>yet.</v>

321
00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:20.830
<v Speaker 3>So they'd all play bingo and then they </v>
<v Speaker 3>bet the numbers.</v>

322
00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:21.880
<v Speaker 3>There was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a woman,</v>

323
00:14:21.881 --> 00:14:22.714
<v Speaker 3>gina,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she had these two little schnauzer </v>

324
00:14:24.431 --> 00:14:25.264
<v Speaker 3>dogs and she'd walk up and down mulberry</v>
<v Speaker 3>street and people would stop and say hi </v>

325
00:14:28.391 --> 00:14:29.224
<v Speaker 3>to her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like every half a block because she ran </v>

326
00:14:31.271 --> 00:14:32.104
<v Speaker 3>the numbers and you gave her 10 bucks </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't know if you know how the </v>

327
00:14:34.721 --> 00:14:35.554
<v Speaker 3>numbers work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they basically take the purse </v>

328
00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:41.230
<v Speaker 3>aqueduct every day you'd look in the New</v>
<v Speaker 3>York post and it's,</v>

329
00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.960
<v Speaker 3>there's a purse that's like however much</v>
<v Speaker 3>money was bet.</v>

330
00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:44.943
<v Speaker 3>Say It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

331
00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:50.250
<v Speaker 3>300,000 5:51 and the last three digits </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the purse is</v>

332
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:54.020
<v Speaker 4>what the number is that one the day </v>
<v Speaker 4>before.</v>

333
00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:58.760
<v Speaker 4>So you play three numbers for $10 and it</v>
<v Speaker 4>pays w,</v>

334
00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:00.380
<v Speaker 4>w,</v>
<v Speaker 4>w what would the odds be?</v>

335
00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:04.820
<v Speaker 4>Tend to 100 to one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what the odds are,</v>

336
00:15:04.821 --> 00:15:07.520
<v Speaker 4>but at this fucking old lady walking </v>
<v Speaker 4>around,</v>

337
00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:09.830
<v Speaker 4>she'd go to the shark bar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People make bets with her.</v>

338
00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:12.740
<v Speaker 4>My grandmother went to jail for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No shit.</v>

339
00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:14.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

340
00:15:14.101 --> 00:15:14.781
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

341
00:15:14.781 --> 00:15:18.440
<v Speaker 4>When we would go visit her in jersey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>newark.</v>

342
00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:21.170

<v Speaker 4>We'd go visit her for six months.</v>

343
00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:22.490

<v Speaker 4>I couldn't afford anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I definitely couldn't afford to live </v>

395
00:17:28.881 --> 00:17:29.714
<v Speaker 4>anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so my grandfather said that I could </v>

00:17:31.461 --> 00:17:32.294
<v Speaker 4>stay with them for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So newark in newark on north ninth </v>

397
00:17:35.811 --> 00:17:38.360

<v Speaker 4>It's the fucking the like.</v>

398
00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:39.793
<v Speaker 4>It's a bad neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like my grandparents live in a bad </v>

399
00:17:41.901 --> 00:17:42.734
<v Speaker 4>neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

400
00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:43.953
<v Speaker 4>it was a good neighborhood at one point </v>
<v Speaker 4>in time was an all italian neighborhood </v>

401
00:17:45.651 --> 00:17:46.484
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did a thing called blockbusting when </v>

402
00:17:47.451 --> 00:17:48.740
<v Speaker 4>they move in and say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

403
00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:51.120
<v Speaker 4>I'm black people moving into your </v>
<v Speaker 4>neighborhood.</v>

404
00:17:51.121 --> 00:17:52.980
<v Speaker 4>You have to seLl now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you going to lose all your money?</v>

405
00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:54.990
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some people would just sell their houses</v>

406
00:17:54.991 --> 00:17:56.760
<v Speaker 4>left and right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And everybody moved down and it became a</v>

407
00:17:56.761 --> 00:17:58.530
<v Speaker 4>black neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But my grandfather was like,</v>

408
00:17:58.531 --> 00:18:00.570
<v Speaker 4>I like black people who gives a fuck get</v>
<v Speaker 4>off my lawn.</v>

409
00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:02.970
<v Speaker 4>It's like it was his house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was never getting rid of that house.</v>

410
00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:08.520
<v Speaker 4>And my grandmother had this aneurysm and</v>
<v Speaker 4>she lived and she lived in agony.</v>

411
00:18:08.521 --> 00:18:10.260
<v Speaker 4>And so when I was staying with them when</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>

412
00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:13.080
<v Speaker 4>when I moved to New York and I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>have an apartment for three months,</v>

413
00:18:13.081 --> 00:18:15.540
<v Speaker 4>I stayed with them and she would just </v>
<v Speaker 4>moan,</v>

414
00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:19.600
<v Speaker 4>make these horrible bones and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>god damn it.</v>

415
00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.960
<v Speaker 4>She realized what it's like when your </v>
<v Speaker 4>body fails.</v>

416
00:18:21.961 --> 00:18:26.961
<v Speaker 4>You still alive for years and years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was all my threshold for pull.</v>

417
00:18:27.721 --> 00:18:30.450
<v Speaker 4>The plug is really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really high.</v>

418
00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:32.210
<v Speaker 4>Low.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's low.</v>

419
00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:34.440
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I get anywhere near that state,</v>

420
00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.130
<v Speaker 4>take me out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

421
00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:38.610
<v Speaker 4>just died.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The angel of death.</v>

422
00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:39.473
<v Speaker 4>Remember that guy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He worked in a nursing home and he </v>

423
00:18:40.951 --> 00:18:44.580
<v Speaker 4>killed 37 people over like three decades</v>
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>

424
00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:45.503
<v Speaker 4>And he would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people that like your grandmother that </v>

425
00:18:46.291 --> 00:18:48.630
<v Speaker 4>we're suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he would just fucking take them out.</v>

426
00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:53.160
<v Speaker 4>If people knew and they started bringing</v>
<v Speaker 4>them into that place,</v>

427
00:18:53.161 --> 00:18:53.760
<v Speaker 4>I would.</v>

428
00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:54.850
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 4>a good reason.</v>

00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:26.390
<v Speaker 1>oppenheimer in the last podcast with sam</v>
<v Speaker 1>harris for dan harris from abc news.</v>

490
00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:27.493
<v Speaker 1>He had never heard that oppenheimer </v>
<v Speaker 1>quote when he quotes the bhagavad gita </v>

491
00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:32.410
<v Speaker 1>after the bomb went off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what did he say?</v>

492
00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:33.320
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>behold,</v>

00:21:33.321 --> 00:21:38.300
<v Speaker 1>I am become death destroyer of worlds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so creepy when you hear oppenheimer</v>

494
00:21:38.301 --> 00:21:39.134
<v Speaker 1>say I play it,</v>

00:21:40.341 --> 00:21:41.570
<v Speaker 1>when people be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

496
00:21:41.571 --> 00:21:42.404
<v Speaker 1>Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll play for you after it's over </v>

497
00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:44.143
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'S creepy because you see his face </v>

498
00:21:45.531 --> 00:21:46.364
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the guy that made the fucking </v>

499
00:21:47.001 --> 00:21:47.834
<v Speaker 1>bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

500
00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:48.723
<v Speaker 1>ThAt's his reaction to read some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sanskrit bhagavad gita quote about </v>

501
00:21:53.691 --> 00:21:54.524
<v Speaker 1>vishnu.</v>

502
00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:58.020
<v Speaker 3>So where did that come from?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because usually it's like the christian,</v>

503
00:21:58.210 --> 00:22:00.300
<v Speaker 3>the christians that believe in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

504
00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:02.550
<v Speaker 3>the second coming or into that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

505
00:22:02.551 --> 00:22:03.800
<v Speaker 3>But that eastern,</v>

506
00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:06.250
<v Speaker 1>either I don't think of eastern religion</v>
<v Speaker 1>is being like that.</v>

507
00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:07.570
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was.</v>

508
00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:11.920
<v Speaker 1>Oppenheimer was a fucking phenomenally </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent guy.</v>

509
00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:14.830
<v Speaker 1>he was really looking at sam microscopes</v>
<v Speaker 1>or something.</v>

510
00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:17.560
<v Speaker 1>He created the nuclear bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what he did before that,</v>

511
00:22:17.561 --> 00:22:19.780
<v Speaker 1>but he was one of the main people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a team of people,</v>

512
00:22:19.781 --> 00:22:22.320
<v Speaker 1>obviously the manhattan project,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

513
00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:24.520
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

514
00:22:24.521 --> 00:22:25.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a,</v>

515
00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:27.910
<v Speaker 1>a super genius guy that sam harris was </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

516
00:22:27.911 --> 00:22:28.744
<v Speaker 1>we need to double check if that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But sam harris was st last podcast that </v>

517
00:22:31.481 --> 00:22:33.400
<v Speaker 1>he taught himself sanskrit in three </v>
<v Speaker 1>months,</v>

<v Speaker 1>or was it dan harrison said that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember who said it is,</v>

519
00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:38.980

<v Speaker 1>like what you were talking about earlier</v>
<v Speaker 1>about energy,</v>

521
00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:42.053

<v Speaker 1>strong topic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like any topic can be strong if you do </v>

<v Speaker 3>no writing jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been,</v>

578
00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:31.820
<v Speaker 3>I've been in a little bit of a slump </v>
<v Speaker 3>lately.</v>

579
00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:32.743
<v Speaker 3>I think mostly because I'm putting </v>
<v Speaker 3>another hour together so I've just been </v>

580
00:25:34.561 --> 00:25:37.890
<v Speaker 3>focused on taking the last two or three </v>
<v Speaker 3>years material,</v>

581
00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:39.083
<v Speaker 3>transitioning it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tightening it up and so I haven't been </v>

582
00:25:41.071 --> 00:25:44.370
<v Speaker 3>writing new stuff and then when I go </v>
<v Speaker 3>back to writing new stuff,</v>

583
00:25:44.371 --> 00:25:47.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how does comedy work again?</v>

584
00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:48.683
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's okay.</v>

585
00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:52.610
<v Speaker 1>Cop out that we do when we're working on</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff that we don't do new stuff.</v>

586
00:25:53.050 --> 00:25:53.930
<v Speaker 1>New stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

587
00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:56.800
<v Speaker 1>You lose that muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck that weird muscle is.</v>

588
00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:57.713
<v Speaker 3>I just forget like when you really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you really want to get into </v>

589
00:25:59.941 --> 00:26:02.220
<v Speaker 3>joke writing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Breaking it down.</v>

590
00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:05.280
<v Speaker 3>It's like what you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you take the low hanging fruit?</v>

591
00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:06.473
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there's always that thing that </v>

592
00:26:07.111 --> 00:26:08.070
<v Speaker 3>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

593
00:26:08.071 --> 00:26:10.200
<v Speaker 3>there's that moment where you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

594
00:26:10.201 --> 00:26:12.090
<v Speaker 3>that's a fucking joke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

595
00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:13.980
<v Speaker 3>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just bid about my,</v>

596
00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:15.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm driving home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my wife,</v>

597
00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:18.800
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my wIfe texts me what time I going to be</v>

598
00:26:18.801 --> 00:26:21.240
<v Speaker 3>home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I write 6:00 and she says,</v>

599
00:26:21.241 --> 00:26:23.540
<v Speaker 3>will you bring home some eggs?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I wrote,</v>

600
00:26:23.541 --> 00:26:26.310
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I wrote what are you wearing?</v>

601
00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:27.833
<v Speaker 3>And then I got a text back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my cleats in my soccer uniform and I </v>

602
00:26:30.271 --> 00:26:31.104
<v Speaker 3>realized my wife is driving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>son has her phone and then I got a text </v>

603
00:26:35.641 --> 00:26:36.750
<v Speaker 3>right after that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why,</v>

604
00:26:36.751 --> 00:26:39.540
<v Speaker 3>what are you wearing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was just like,</v>

605
00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:41.260
<v Speaker 3>alrIght,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have to write anything there.</v>

606
00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:44.070
<v Speaker 3>There's a fucking perfect is a funny </v>
<v Speaker 3>bit.</v>

607
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:47.070
<v Speaker 3>And then I realized like I didn't take </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

608
00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:50.790
<v Speaker 3>I've been doing that bit for a year and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't pushed it.</v>

609
00:26:51.850 --> 00:26:54.120
<v Speaker 3>And like bill burr saw me do a bit one </v>
<v Speaker 3>night and he's like,</v>

610
00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:55.320
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing?</v>

611
00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:58.180
<v Speaker 3>You got fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you gotta fucking unbelievable premise.</v>

612
00:26:58.181 --> 00:26:59.650
<v Speaker 3>Say you gotta fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he,</v>

613
00:26:59.710 --> 00:27:00.543
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he like riffs like five other beats to </v>

614
00:27:03.121 --> 00:27:06.390
<v Speaker 3>the bit that I do now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you just realized like,</v>

615
00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:07.253
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>

616
00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:10.410
<v Speaker 3>I'm not fucking pushing it as far as I </v>
<v Speaker 3>can push it.</v>

617
00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:13.260
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that's an energy thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what you were talking about before?</v>

618
00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:14.243
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a confidence thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's having the confidence to </v>

619
00:27:18.061 --> 00:27:18.894
<v Speaker 3>say there's more to this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm capable of getting more out of this </v>

620
00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:24.030
<v Speaker 3>instead of just going like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

621
00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:24.923
<v Speaker 3>now let me quick get something else </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's going to get an immediate laugh </v>

622
00:27:26.791 --> 00:27:29.070
<v Speaker 3>and jumped topics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

623
00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:29.671
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

624
00:27:29.671 --> 00:27:30.504
<v Speaker 3>Which is a hallmark of someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 3>inexperienced or working on completely </v>

625
00:27:33.361 --> 00:27:34.420
<v Speaker 3>new stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

626
00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:36.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When someone's inexperienced,</v>

627
00:27:36.670 --> 00:27:39.110
<v Speaker 1>like when you watch open microbes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like one of the biggest things that</v>

628
00:27:39.111 --> 00:27:39.944
<v Speaker 1>they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also conversely that the right way </v>

629
00:27:42.951 --> 00:27:43.781
<v Speaker 1>to use it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

637
00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:02.750

643
00:28:16.511 --> 00:28:17.030
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

644
00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:19.610
<v Speaker 1>that weird thing your phone does if you </v>

645
00:28:19.630 --> 00:28:20.463
<v Speaker 1>your car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes on my car I'll just start </v>

646
00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:24.770
<v Speaker 1>playing random songs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Just randomly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

648
00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:29.300
<v Speaker 1>I completely randomly like it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just starts playing like I don't even</v>

649
00:28:29.301 --> 00:28:30.410
<v Speaker 1>press play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get the car,</v>

650
00:28:30.411 --> 00:28:32.990
<v Speaker 1>start the car and when I did it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a song,</v>

651
00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:33.973
<v Speaker 1>the song went off and then the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing was a richard jeni bit and I was </v>

652
00:28:36.681 --> 00:28:39.580

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

653

<v Speaker 1>it was so fun.</v>

654
00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:45.220
<v Speaker 3>And not only that you are losing a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of it because seeing that guy live,</v>

655
00:28:45.221 --> 00:28:46.054
<v Speaker 3>he fucking glided around the stage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He physic because he was a little guy </v>

656
00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:50.923
<v Speaker 3>and so he appeared.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd see him after a show and you'd be </v>

657
00:28:52.511 --> 00:28:54.610
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not the guy that the guy on stage</v>

658
00:28:54.611 --> 00:28:56.390
<v Speaker 3>was six foot one.</v>

00:28:56.540 --> 00:28:58.780
<v Speaker 3>you're five foot Seven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what happened to that other guy?</v>

660
00:28:58.830 --> 00:29:01.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well he dId.</v>

661
00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:05.190
<v Speaker 1>That's special with one of those mc </v>
<v Speaker 1>hammer earpieces holidays.</v>

662
00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:07.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm a motivational speaker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things right.</v>

663
00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:11.540
<v Speaker 1>He had one of those on or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had either that or a lav mic,</v>

664
00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:13.730
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't have a mic in his hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I'm always like,</v>

665
00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:14.863
<v Speaker 1>what are you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you transitioning away from </v>

666
00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:18.710
<v Speaker 1>being a stand up and now you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>

667
00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:21.660
<v Speaker 3>He really uses his hands for most people</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't need that.</v>

668
00:29:21.661 --> 00:29:23.730
<v Speaker 3>But for him it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

669
00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:28.770
<v Speaker 3>he explored physically space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He accentuated punchlines with movement.</v>

670
00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:29.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

671
00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:32.760
<v Speaker 3>and I would watch him night after night </v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes,</v>

672
00:29:32.761 --> 00:29:36.510
<v Speaker 3>and if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if he was saying the word glo his,</v>

673
00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:38.400
<v Speaker 3>he would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his weight would be on his left foot.</v>

674
00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:39.383
<v Speaker 3>His right finger would be in the Air and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'd be the same fucking way the next </v>

675
00:29:41.921 --> 00:29:42.190
<v Speaker 3>night.</v>

676
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:43.120
<v Speaker 5>It was like a ballet.</v>

677
00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:44.003
<v Speaker 1>It was exact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was my opinion the best at taking a </v>

678
00:29:48.301 --> 00:29:49.134
<v Speaker 1>premise and just ringing all the funny </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of it and I remember watching him </v>

679
00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:54.473
<v Speaker 1>and one of the first things that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>realized when I was watching it because </v>

680
00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:57.733
<v Speaker 1>I went to see him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I paid to see him before ever did stand </v>

681
00:30:00.241 --> 00:30:02.640
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

682
00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:06.720
<v Speaker 1>I remember thinking I actually sat in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the front row.</v>

683
00:30:06.721 --> 00:30:09.000
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty bad ass at catch a rising </v>
<v Speaker 1>star in cambridge.</v>

684
00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:11.720
<v Speaker 1>And I remember I saw also saw many </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed there.</v>

685
00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:13.840
<v Speaker 1>I saw kevin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were together that night.</v>

686
00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:16.440
<v Speaker 1>I saw him crushed there a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>

687
00:30:16.770 --> 00:30:17.603
<v Speaker 1>but I saw me and he crushed so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went with my friend diane from high </v>

688

<v Speaker 1>school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were buddies and we went and it was </v>

689

<v Speaker 1>like one of the few girlfriends that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>had back then we were just buddies and </v>

707
00:31:19.711 --> 00:31:20.544
<v Speaker 5>just started laughing at this insane man</v>
<v Speaker 5>who was sweating and flopping around on </v>

<v Speaker 1>there was no bombing at all.</v>

711
00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:28.423
<v Speaker 1>It was just destruction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was when he had just done hbo and he </v>

713
00:31:34.741 --> 00:31:37.500

<v Speaker 1>it's hard to describe because so much is</v>

714
00:31:37.501 --> 00:31:41.640
<v Speaker 1>lost when you see a guy like that on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>big stage or on television.</v>

720
00:31:51.311 --> 00:31:52.144
<v Speaker 1>and going like god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he was like so silly and it was so </v>

721
00:31:55.201 --> 00:31:56.034
<v Speaker 1>fun to get caught up in his silly.</v>

<v Speaker 1>they had some fucking music and a funny </v>

724
00:32:05.671 --> 00:32:08.460
<v Speaker 1>song.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He kept that bit too long.</v>

726
00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:12.840
<v Speaker 1>Way too long now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was his downfall.</v>

727
00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:18.220
<v Speaker 1>That was his downfall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was he crushed for a decade?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Five years?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

729
00:32:19.141 --> 00:32:22.650

<v Speaker 2>it's inspiring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You mean getting on a private jet and go</v>

808
00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:57.900
<v Speaker 2>into that because you sent out one tweet</v>
<v Speaker 2>tweet anymore.</v>

809
00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:00.360
<v Speaker 2>He deleted his twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the cla,</v>

810
00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:01.223
<v Speaker 2>all the theater just tweet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like ticketmaster sends out a tweet and </v>

811
00:36:03.871 --> 00:36:06.780
<v Speaker 2>it fucking sells out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how smart is that that he recognizes</v>

812
00:36:06.781 --> 00:36:09.360
<v Speaker 2>he's at that stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just steps away from.</v>

813
00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:10.463
<v Speaker 2>But it also takes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you have to have like I think </v>

814
00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:16.950
<v Speaker 2>some people need to spend a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>plates.</v>

815
00:36:16.951 --> 00:36:17.784
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't just do standup because I start </v>

816
00:36:19.651 --> 00:36:20.730
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not so much bored,</v>

817
00:36:20.731 --> 00:36:24.420
<v Speaker 2>but I just feel like I got to do with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the shit I get claustrophobic.</v>

818
00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:25.543
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I just,</v>

819
00:36:25.770 --> 00:36:26.790
<v Speaker 2>I need to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>

820
00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:29.850
<v Speaker 2>like right now I'm writing on a show and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking loving it.</v>

821
00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:32.460
<v Speaker 2>And I'm taking you run on a pizza right </v>
<v Speaker 2>on pete holmes show.</v>

822
00:36:32.461 --> 00:36:35.940
<v Speaker 2>Chris was talking about before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pete holmes is such a good guy.</v>

823
00:36:35.970 --> 00:36:37.170
<v Speaker 2>He's a good dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is.</v>

824
00:36:37.171 --> 00:36:39.330
<v Speaker 2>And he's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a nice guy.</v>

825
00:36:39.390 --> 00:36:40.223
<v Speaker 2>He's good in the room too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we're coming up with show ideas </v>

826
00:36:42.241 --> 00:36:42.721
<v Speaker 2>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

827
00:36:42.721 --> 00:36:43.554
<v Speaker 2>there's like seven or eight writers </v>
<v Speaker 2>pitch and shit and they're all talented </v>

828
00:36:45.991 --> 00:36:46.870
<v Speaker 2>writers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

829
00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:48.870
<v Speaker 2>and then he'll just go like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

830
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:50.490
<v Speaker 2>he is the best way of saying no.</v>

831
00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:51.803
<v Speaker 2>It's very hard to write a room to run a </v>
<v Speaker 2>room and not make people feel like </v>

832
00:36:56.341 --> 00:37:00.030
<v Speaker 2>they're not heard or they're being </v>
<v Speaker 2>rejected and he's got this energy that's</v>

833
00:37:00.031 --> 00:37:01.020
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

834
00:37:01.021 --> 00:37:03.750
<v Speaker 2>that's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what if we did this?</v>

835
00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:05.970
<v Speaker 2>And you sorta like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he moves on in a way that,</v>

836
00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:06.953
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea is not getting used but it </v>

837
00:37:08.221 --> 00:37:09.054
<v Speaker 2>might have triggered something else in </v>
<v Speaker 2>him and we ended up with these episodes </v>

838
00:37:13.051 --> 00:37:17.400
<v Speaker 2>that are just fucking linear and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>there things that he signed off on and a</v>

839
00:37:17.401 --> 00:37:21.340
<v Speaker 2>lot of times you get somebody running a </v>
<v Speaker 2>writer's room and they,</v>

840
00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:22.383
<v Speaker 2>they get codependent so they'll put shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>the script that they don't even believe </v>

841
00:37:24.601 --> 00:37:25.434
<v Speaker 2>in and between him and judge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>judge in the room a lot between the two </v>

842
00:37:28.021 --> 00:37:29.340
<v Speaker 2>of them in the room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got fucking,</v>

843
00:37:29.341 --> 00:37:32.010
<v Speaker 2>we got episodes locked down alreadY.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's awesome.</v>

844
00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:33.203
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is that weird dynamic between </v>

845
00:37:34.351 --> 00:37:37.320
<v Speaker 2>showrunners and and comics and actors.</v>

846
00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:40.260
<v Speaker 2>And it's such a struggle that everyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>gets,</v>

847
00:37:40.290 --> 00:37:41.123
<v Speaker 2>wants to get their greasy fingers on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in the beginning or at the </v>

848
00:37:43.951 --> 00:37:44.784
<v Speaker 2>beginning of the shows create like once </v>
<v Speaker 2>you get to like some simpsons level or </v>

849
00:37:49.051 --> 00:37:51.480
<v Speaker 2>it's just like it's just a smooth </v>
<v Speaker 2>machine.</v>

850
00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:53.700
<v Speaker 2>Just they know what the fuck to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Leave hIm alone.</v>

851
00:37:53.701 --> 00:37:55.180
<v Speaker 2>Leave most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stay away from the south park guys.</v>

852
00:37:55.210 --> 00:37:57.060
<v Speaker 2>Just get the fuck out of the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

853
00:37:57.061 --> 00:37:58.680
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't get your greasy fingers in it.</v>

854
00:37:58.770 --> 00:38:02.520
<v Speaker 2>Now if it's a brand new show and also </v>
<v Speaker 2>being an hbo show,</v>

855
00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:04.740
<v Speaker 2>they just give you the keys to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

856
00:38:04.741 --> 00:38:07.020
<v Speaker 2>do it lock up when you're done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>

857
00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:09.150
<v Speaker 2>there's no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I wasn't there the first season,</v>

858
00:38:09.151 --> 00:38:11.190
<v Speaker 2>but I heard there was very little notes </v>
<v Speaker 2>from hbo.</v>

859
00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:14.550
<v Speaker 2>That's what netflix is kind of doing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>netflix.</v>

860
00:38:14.551 --> 00:38:16.830
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't have any notes why the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>shows are good.</v>

861
00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:17.910
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

862
00:38:17.911 --> 00:38:19.810
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at these network multi cameras,</v>

863
00:38:19.811 --> 00:38:20.940
<v Speaker 2>sitcoms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

864
00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:25.620
<v Speaker 2>do you ever see the clip where they take</v>
<v Speaker 2>the laugh track out of big bang theory?</v>

865
00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:27.660
<v Speaker 2>I have seen that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Terrific.</v>

866
00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:29.910
<v Speaker 2>But you know what that is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's pickups.</v>

867
00:38:29.911 --> 00:38:31.230
<v Speaker 2>A lot of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean?</v>

868
00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:32.273
<v Speaker 2>You know what pickups are like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You shoot a scene and then they have to </v>

869
00:38:34.590 --> 00:38:35.423
<v Speaker 2>change a line or they want to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>something different and they do pick up </v>

870
00:38:37.170 --> 00:38:42.170
<v Speaker 2>some episode of big bang theory that </v>
<v Speaker 2>aired and then they sucked out the laugh</v>

871
00:38:43.331 --> 00:38:46.570
<v Speaker 2>track.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're seeing these negative.</v>

872
00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:47.980
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

873
00:38:48.130 --> 00:38:48.963
<v Speaker 2>you're seeing silence where normally you</v>
<v Speaker 2>would be laughing in theory if it was </v>

874
00:38:53.441 --> 00:38:54.274
<v Speaker 2>funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they just insert laughs and so I </v>

875
00:38:55.991 --> 00:38:59.380
<v Speaker 2>guess people at home laugh at the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>time because they're triggered to.</v>

876
00:38:59.650 --> 00:39:01.030
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's might be very.</v>

877
00:39:01.090 --> 00:39:02.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a soundtrack.</v>

878
00:39:02.411 --> 00:39:03.760
<v Speaker 2>Probably a laugh track rather.</v>

879
00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:05.440
<v Speaker 2>The laugh track is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

880
00:39:05.441 --> 00:39:07.780
<v Speaker 2>it's like some kind of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we did shows,</v>

881
00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:08.820
<v Speaker 2>I think there were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do,</v>

882
00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:10.420
<v Speaker 2>we didn't even know what audience and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they just,</v>

883
00:39:10.610 --> 00:39:13.390
<v Speaker 2>they did a laugh track on news radio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

884
00:39:13.391 --> 00:39:14.224
<v Speaker 2>you guys did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We did a couple shows that were like </v>

885
00:39:15.781 --> 00:39:16.614
<v Speaker 2>completely ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember if they used to laugh </v>

886
00:39:18.371 --> 00:39:21.340
<v Speaker 2>track or if they showed it to people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's some of them they showed it</v>

887
00:39:21.341 --> 00:39:22.174
<v Speaker 2>to people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like in at least one or two </v>

888
00:39:23.831 --> 00:39:27.010
<v Speaker 2>scenes or mother had a laugh track,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we did a few episodes that were like</v>

889
00:39:27.070 --> 00:39:29.380
<v Speaker 2>super bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like one of them was in space,</v>

890
00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:31.540
<v Speaker 2>so the whole episode took place in </v>
<v Speaker 2>space,</v>

891
00:39:31.570 --> 00:39:34.240
<v Speaker 2>like just news radio in space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No explanation whatsoever.</v>

892
00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:37.150
<v Speaker 2>A space suit on like the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking ridiculous.</v>

893
00:39:37.590 --> 00:39:40.570
<v Speaker 2>And that deep into season six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

894
00:39:40.571 --> 00:39:42.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember what season,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we only dId five seasons,</v>

895
00:39:42.401 --> 00:39:44.140
<v Speaker 2>but another one we did a titanic </v>
<v Speaker 2>episode.</v>

896
00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:47.230
<v Speaker 2>We will do one ridiculous episode every </v>
<v Speaker 2>now and again.</v>

897
00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:48.293
<v Speaker 2>The titanic episode.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We literally had a fill the setup with </v>

898
00:39:50.141 --> 00:39:50.974
<v Speaker 2>water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in the titanic episode mark sloshing </v>

899
00:39:53.501 --> 00:39:57.850
<v Speaker 2>through water up to my waist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's freezing or it's fucking cold man,</v>

900
00:39:58.090 --> 00:39:58.923
<v Speaker 2>because like you think of water that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>climb into like unless you're outside </v>

901
00:40:01.991 --> 00:40:02.824
<v Speaker 2>and this is a summer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's 100 degrees out there was going to </v>

902
00:40:04.331 --> 00:40:05.164
<v Speaker 2>be fucking cold and you can only stand </v>
<v Speaker 2>it for so long before you start </v>

903
00:40:07.781 --> 00:40:10.290
<v Speaker 2>shivering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're walking through the.</v>

904
00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:11.300
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

905
00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:13.480
<v Speaker 2>they turned a set.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'll fucking swimming pool.</v>

906
00:40:13.481 --> 00:40:16.150
<v Speaker 2>So ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>

907
00:40:16.290 --> 00:40:18.340
<v Speaker 2>Just paul simms as a genius.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

908
00:40:18.430 --> 00:40:20.040
<v Speaker 2>It was just a mad man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

909
00:40:20.070 --> 00:40:20.903
<v Speaker 2>we should do one night just as an </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiment is set ups a couple speakers </v>

910
00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:25.413
<v Speaker 2>in the back of the room at the comedy </v>
<v Speaker 2>store and do a laugh track during our </v>

911
00:40:28.751 --> 00:40:32.350
<v Speaker 2>set and see if it makes the audience </v>
<v Speaker 2>just fucking go into a frenzy.</v>

912
00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:35.800
<v Speaker 2>Would you think that it wouldn't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>something's amiss?</v>

913
00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:36.993
<v Speaker 2>That would really be funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You write a bunch of shit that's </v>

914
00:40:38.801 --> 00:40:42.700
<v Speaker 2>purposely not funny and have some </v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous soundtrack.</v>

915
00:40:43.690 --> 00:40:44.523
<v Speaker 2>See how people reacted that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There'll be a fascinating experience </v>

916
00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:48.333
<v Speaker 2>experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rather if you did something super </v>

917
00:40:49.991 --> 00:40:51.400
<v Speaker 2>offensive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

918
00:40:51.401 --> 00:40:53.920
<v Speaker 2>you talked about something like super </v>
<v Speaker 2>super offensive.</v>

919
00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:54.863
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you did it all under hidden cameras </v>

920
00:40:57.010 --> 00:40:57.843
<v Speaker 2>and you just see if people laughed at </v>

961
00:42:31.691 --> 00:42:32.524
<v Speaker 3>because it's easier on stage in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it's a good crowd and you go up </v>

<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

988
00:43:49.871 --> 00:43:50.704
<v Speaker 3>there was an ice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a lake near my house growing </v>

989
00:43:51.971 --> 00:43:54.580
<v Speaker 3>up and we used to skate there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was fucking unbelievable.</v>

990
00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:56.080
<v Speaker 3>I grew up in tarrytown,</v>
<v Speaker 3>New York,</v>

991
00:43:56.081 --> 00:43:58.960
<v Speaker 3>and we had this reservoir that actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>feeds New York city.</v>

992
00:43:58.961 --> 00:44:02.020
<v Speaker 3>It's like the main reservoir for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>water drinking water in New York city.</v>

993
00:44:02.590 --> 00:44:03.620
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

994
00:44:04.090 --> 00:44:06.610
<v Speaker 3>it would freeze in the winter and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>they had this shack,</v>

995
00:44:06.611 --> 00:44:11.590
<v Speaker 3>this big fucking wooden shack twice the </v>
<v Speaker 3>size of this room and it had benches and</v>

996
00:44:11.591 --> 00:44:14.980
<v Speaker 3>it had a little snack bar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hot chocolate and hot dogs.</v>

997
00:44:15.490 --> 00:44:16.323
<v Speaker 3>Then you go outside and there's like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>wooden wooden steps going down into the </v>

998
00:44:18.701 --> 00:44:21.100
<v Speaker 3>lake with telephone poles.</v>

999
00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:21.933
<v Speaker 3>They put it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is a big fucking leg telephone </v>

1000
00:44:23.621 --> 00:44:25.750
<v Speaker 3>poles around half the circumference of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

<v Speaker 3>spotlights and radio,</v>

1003
00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:33.203
<v Speaker 3>and they would crank fucking pop music </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you'd go out there until 11:00 at </v>

1004
00:44:37.411 --> 00:44:38.244
<v Speaker 3>night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'd hide six packs in The snow on the </v>

1005
00:44:39.991 --> 00:44:42.000
<v Speaker 3>banks of the lake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We go out there,</v>

1006

<v Speaker 3>and they would use a plow to plow the </v>

1010
00:44:54.301 --> 00:44:57.810
<v Speaker 3>snow to make rinks out of the fucking </v>

1115
00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:14.980
<v Speaker 1>in my first days of rest in class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember thinking,</v>

1116
00:50:14.981 --> 00:50:15.814
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck you guys worked this hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to go upstairs with to carry </v>

1117
00:50:19.691 --> 00:50:22.300
<v Speaker 1>someone on our back and climb up stadium</v>
<v Speaker 1>stairs.</v>

1118
00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:25.130
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like why?</v>

1119
00:50:25.140 --> 00:50:25.973
<v Speaker 1>What we're doing what we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Endless drills were fireman carrying </v>

1120
00:50:28.791 --> 00:50:31.340
<v Speaker 1>each other back and forth across the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking gym,</v>

1121
00:50:31.341 --> 00:50:34.820
<v Speaker 1>racing each other and constant live </v>
<v Speaker 1>drills with wrestling.</v>

1122
00:50:34.821 --> 00:50:37.280
<v Speaker 1>I would leave there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could barelY walk.</v>

1123
00:50:37.310 --> 00:50:38.470
<v Speaker 1>I was so tired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't.</v>

1124
00:50:38.780 --> 00:50:39.613
<v Speaker 1>I didn't do any homework while I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestling and I just want up doing no </v>

1125
00:50:41.991 --> 00:50:42.824
<v Speaker 1>homework ever.</v>

1126
00:50:42.990 --> 00:50:44.580
<v Speaker 3>THat's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>With wrestling you.</v>

1127
00:50:44.581 --> 00:50:46.680
<v Speaker 3>It really fucks up your grades.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You come home,</v>

1128
00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:49.330
<v Speaker 3>annihilate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>violated your hungry.</v>

1129
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:50.833
<v Speaker 3>But I just want to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then did you have to try to lose </v>

1130
00:50:53.611 --> 00:50:54.444
<v Speaker 3>weight from her?</v>

1131
00:50:55.530 --> 00:50:57.990
<v Speaker 1>I did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I wound up stopping doing it because</v>

1132
00:50:58.320 --> 00:51:01.890
<v Speaker 1>my friend steven was wrestling at 128 </v>
<v Speaker 1>pounds and he was a better wrestler than</v>

1133
00:51:01.891 --> 00:51:02.724
<v Speaker 1>me so I went up to 1:34,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is basically like what I weighed </v>

1134
00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:07.500
<v Speaker 1>when I was 14 or 15,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it was.</v>

1135
00:51:07.650 --> 00:51:10.110
<v Speaker 1>So it was pretty easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have to cut any weiGht at all,</v>

1136
00:51:10.111 --> 00:51:10.944
<v Speaker 1>but then I cut weight for taekwondo when</v>
<v Speaker 1>I stopped wrestling and then I started </v>

1137
00:51:14.010 --> 00:51:14.843
<v Speaker 1>fiGhting and taekwondo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I cut a lot of weight up until I was 17 </v>

1138
00:51:17.791 --> 00:51:20.670
<v Speaker 1>and then when I was 17 I was still </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to make 140 pounds,</v>

1139
00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:24.720
<v Speaker 1>but I'd be walking around at like 1:50 </v>
<v Speaker 1>something and I would just starve myself</v>

1140
00:51:24.721 --> 00:51:25.554
<v Speaker 1>and dehydrate myself was terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really fucked with my performance and </v>

1141
00:51:28.891 --> 00:51:29.724
<v Speaker 1>then I stopped doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went up to 1:54 and when I went up to </v>

1142
00:51:32.551 --> 00:51:33.900
<v Speaker 1>1:54,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I became way better.</v>

1143
00:51:34.470 --> 00:51:37.980
<v Speaker 1>That was when I Got better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was holding myself back by the dieting</v>

1144
00:51:37.981 --> 00:51:40.080
<v Speaker 1>and I think that that's a big factor </v>
<v Speaker 1>with wrestlers,</v>

1145
00:51:40.410 --> 00:51:44.460
<v Speaker 1>but one thing we wrestlers is that their</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mental toughness,</v>

1146
00:51:44.461 --> 00:51:48.360
<v Speaker 1>because of that weight cutting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost worth it because the mental.</v>

1147
00:51:48.361 --> 00:51:50.430
<v Speaker 1>It's super bad for your health to cut a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of weight,</v>

1148
00:51:50.431 --> 00:51:52.290
<v Speaker 1>but those guys who could do it and still</v>
<v Speaker 1>compete,</v>

1149
00:51:52.620 --> 00:51:57.150
<v Speaker 1>they have the ability to push through </v>
<v Speaker 1>discomfort and just have a drive to win.</v>

1150
00:51:57.290 --> 00:51:58.123
<v Speaker 1>At.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very few sports can match because very </v>

1151
00:51:59.461 --> 00:52:00.294
<v Speaker 1>few sports,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where will the athlete compete in a </v>

1152
00:52:03.061 --> 00:52:06.330
<v Speaker 1>state of like uncomfort as much as </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestlers?</v>

1153
00:52:06.970 --> 00:52:09.600
<v Speaker 1>They're just dieting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>starving theMselves,</v>

1154
00:52:09.601 --> 00:52:13.650
<v Speaker 1>dehydrating themselves and still going </v>
<v Speaker 1>out there like fucking savages.</v>

1155
00:52:14.580 --> 00:52:18.210
<v Speaker 1>So it's just a different kind of sport </v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1156
00:52:18.450 --> 00:52:19.470
<v Speaker 1>Different sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>

1157
00:52:19.650 --> 00:52:22.560
<v Speaker 1>that girl basically beat my ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean she didn't really beat my ass,</v>

1158
00:52:22.561 --> 00:52:25.230
<v Speaker 1>but she was younger than you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think she was my age.</v>

1159
00:52:25.650 --> 00:52:27.990
<v Speaker 1>She was on the bus too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was taking the bus back,</v>

1160
00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:30.840
<v Speaker 1>but I was thinking I'd better not </v>
<v Speaker 1>punched this girl.</v>

1161
00:52:31.170 --> 00:52:32.490
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so glad I didn't.</v>

1162
00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:34.710
<v Speaker 1>I got smacked by a gay kid in eighth </v>
<v Speaker 1>grade.</v>

1163
00:52:34.770 --> 00:52:36.450
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got pimp slapped.</v>

1164
00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:37.990
<v Speaker 3>Pinch this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this black kid,</v>

1165
00:52:37.991 --> 00:52:38.824
<v Speaker 3>keith.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was really a feminist and so he used </v>

1166
00:52:40.781 --> 00:52:41.810
<v Speaker 3>to tease him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1167
00:52:41.820 --> 00:52:45.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm not proud of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like at that age he just kinda did.</v>

1168
00:52:45.581 --> 00:52:47.260
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1169
00:52:48.070 --> 00:52:49.690
<v Speaker 3>I'm embarrassed by it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we,</v>

1170
00:52:49.691 --> 00:52:50.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to whatever,</v>

1171
00:52:50.741 --> 00:52:53.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cock your wrist and say shit.</v>

1172
00:52:53.500 --> 00:52:57.730
<v Speaker 3>And he turned around a fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>smacked me across the face and I,</v>

1173
00:52:57.731 --> 00:52:58.990
<v Speaker 3>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he stunned me.</v>

1174
00:52:58.991 --> 00:53:00.340
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>holy shit.</v>

1175
00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:03.670
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know what to do because he was,</v>

1176
00:53:04.090 --> 00:53:04.923
<v Speaker 3>he was part of a family that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was projects and tarrytown and </v>

1177
00:53:07.991 --> 00:53:08.824
<v Speaker 3>there were cousins and there were </v>
<v Speaker 3>families that had a lot of cousins and </v>

1178
00:53:11.831 --> 00:53:12.664
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his cousins were some bad ass </v>

1179
00:53:13.781 --> 00:53:15.070
<v Speaker 3>motherfuckers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The davis's.</v>

1180
00:53:15.130 --> 00:53:16.270
<v Speaker 3>Oh no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1181
00:53:16.271 --> 00:53:17.104
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this isn't to say I necessarily would </v>

1182
00:53:18.941 --> 00:53:22.270
<v Speaker 3>have hit him after that for a number of </v>
<v Speaker 3>reasons,</v>

1183
00:53:22.271 --> 00:53:23.770
<v Speaker 3>one of which I was not that touGh.</v>

1184
00:53:23.770 --> 00:53:27.030
<v Speaker 3>I was pretty tough with girls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1185
00:53:27.031 --> 00:53:29.340
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think I was just so shocked.</v>

1186
00:53:29.580 --> 00:53:30.870
<v Speaker 3>Did you know that you deserved it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do,</v>

1187
00:53:30.871 --> 00:53:31.704
<v Speaker 3>do you have a feeling I deserved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got hit a lot as a kid and I deserved </v>

1188
00:53:34.021 --> 00:53:37.650
<v Speaker 3>it most of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got punched in the face in time square</v>

1189
00:53:37.651 --> 00:53:40.290
<v Speaker 3>when I was about 14 drinking southern </v>
<v Speaker 3>comfort.</v>

1190
00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:41.273
<v Speaker 3>I walked past some guy who was like some</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking homeless drug addict who was </v>

1191
00:53:44.371 --> 00:53:47.550
<v Speaker 3>like coughing up a louis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I started coughing really hard to</v>

1192
00:53:47.551 --> 00:53:49.650
<v Speaker 3>making fun of him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He came back and punched me right in the</v>

1193
00:53:49.651 --> 00:53:50.484
<v Speaker 3>face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to get beat up by a </v>

1194
00:53:52.141 --> 00:53:55.140
<v Speaker 3>junkie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know you're not in the days of aids.</v>

<v Speaker 3>everybody.</v>

1209
00:54:35.041 --> 00:54:37.200

1217
00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:52.200

<v Speaker 4>He did it once with this guy and the guy</v>

1218
00:54:52.201 --> 00:54:54.420
<v Speaker 4>knew how to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Guy was beating his ass.</v>

1221
00:55:00.670 --> 00:55:02.350
<v Speaker 4>He was just nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was older than us.</v>

1222
00:55:02.590 --> 00:55:04.670
<v Speaker 4>He was like one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one or two years older than him.</v>

1223
00:55:04.710 --> 00:55:05.830
<v Speaker 4>They guy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nope.</v>

1224
00:55:06.190 --> 00:55:07.360

<v Speaker 4>not particularly big.</v>

1225
00:55:07.390 --> 00:55:10.870
<v Speaker 4>Just fucking tough as nails.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had a boxing tattoo on his arm.</v>

1226
00:55:10.900 --> 00:55:13.120
<v Speaker 4>Like I think he had a tasmanian devil </v>
<v Speaker 4>with boxing gloves on.</v>

1227
00:55:13.420 --> 00:55:14.860
<v Speaker 4>They didn't really box.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1228
00:55:14.910 --> 00:55:15.743
<v Speaker 4>it was just one of those things like </v>
<v Speaker 4>never made it to an actual gym like </v>

1229
00:55:18.011 --> 00:55:18.844
<v Speaker 4>maybe a couple of times,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we just start fights and wasn't </v>

1230
00:55:21.071 --> 00:55:22.390
<v Speaker 4>really that good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1231
00:55:22.450 --> 00:55:23.740
<v Speaker 4>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just crazy.</v>

1232
00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:24.633
<v Speaker 4>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was crazy and he wanted to fight and </v>

1233
00:55:26.711 --> 00:55:30.460
<v Speaker 4>he realized that with his limited </v>
<v Speaker 4>mentality and view of the world that the</v>

1234
00:55:30.461 --> 00:55:32.650
<v Speaker 4>most fun that he had was when he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>fiGhting.</v>

1235
00:55:32.651 --> 00:55:33.484
<v Speaker 4>So it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well that means we fight until he just </v>

1236
00:55:35.770 --> 00:55:37.540
<v Speaker 4>would want to fight all the time.</v>

1237
00:55:37.540 --> 00:55:40.330
<v Speaker 4>Like one time my dog got hit by a car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was really sad,</v>

1238
00:55:40.331 --> 00:55:41.164
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I lived on a busy street and my dog </v>

1239
00:55:44.130 --> 00:55:44.963
<v Speaker 4>opened the door and she gets super </v>
<v Speaker 4>excited to go for a walk and she didn't </v>

1240
00:55:47.550 --> 00:55:49.450
<v Speaker 4>ever on a leash and she ran out into the</v>
<v Speaker 4>street.</v>

1241
00:55:49.451 --> 00:55:51.940
<v Speaker 4>I just didn't anticipate or running.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's usually pretty good about it.</v>

1242
00:55:51.970 --> 00:55:53.800
<v Speaker 4>And she ran out and she got nailed by a </v>
<v Speaker 4>car.</v>

1243
00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:54.731
<v Speaker 4>Geez.</v>

<v Speaker 4>so sad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She died right in front of me.</v>

1245
00:55:56.321 --> 00:56:00.160
<v Speaker 4>I carried her back into the house and </v>
<v Speaker 4>she shit herself.</v>

1246
00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:02.290
<v Speaker 4>Like that's when I knew something I </v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't,</v>

1247
00:56:02.291 --> 00:56:03.124
<v Speaker 4>I still didn't know something was wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but looking back I would've known she </v>

1248
00:56:04.740 --> 00:56:07.900
<v Speaker 4>just shit all over the kitchen and I was</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Like what?</v>

1250
00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:13.010
<v Speaker 4>Like why she never sits in the house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

1251
00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:14.073
<v Speaker 4>then she just slowly slipped away,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just lie down and I'm just stopped </v>

00:56:47.140 --> 00:56:47.973
<v Speaker 1>we had a dog that we adopted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It had distemper when one up having to </v>

1262
00:56:50.381 --> 00:56:51.790
<v Speaker 1>put it to sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>start going crazy.</v>

1263
00:56:51.791 --> 00:56:54.730
<v Speaker 1>It was an adult dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not Adult,</v>

1264
00:56:54.731 --> 00:56:55.564
<v Speaker 1>but it was over a year old and a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a doberman and it just started </v>

1265
00:56:58.571 --> 00:56:59.404
<v Speaker 1>barking at us and smiling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's its teeth and it just started </v>

1266
00:57:01.751 --> 00:57:04.600
<v Speaker 1>losinG its mind and we got it calmed </v>
<v Speaker 1>down enough.</v>

1267
00:57:04.610 --> 00:57:05.443
<v Speaker 1>We'd get a leash on it and brought it to</v>
<v Speaker 1>a vet and the vet said it had to stamp </v>

1268
00:57:08.121 --> 00:57:09.400
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had to put it down.</v>

1269
00:57:09.550 --> 00:57:11.320
<v Speaker 1>So I had had that happen before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've never,</v>

<v Speaker 1>among young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially.</v>

1289
00:57:50.170 --> 00:57:51.820
<v Speaker 1>We were talking about this beFore the </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>

1290
00:57:52.750 --> 00:57:54.940
<v Speaker 1>Everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our age was like a latchkey kid.</v>

1291
00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:56.073
<v Speaker 1>Everybody our age had a mom and a dad </v>
<v Speaker 1>that worked and they open the fucking </v>

1292
00:57:58.691 --> 00:58:01.030
<v Speaker 1>door in the morning and you were off to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the races.</v>

1293
00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:04.600
<v Speaker 1>You went school afterschool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They weren't home for hours,</v>

1294
00:58:04.660 --> 00:58:06.370
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You did a bunch of shit by yourself.</v>

1295
00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:10.090
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time we're around other </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking savages our age.</v>

1296
00:58:10.300 --> 00:58:13.930
<v Speaker 1>So it's the abstract influence of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>parents on the children.</v>

1297
00:58:14.290 --> 00:58:15.123
<v Speaker 1>That is really like giving you your </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience for who you are as a young </v>

1298
00:58:19.541 --> 00:58:20.110
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

1299
00:58:20.110 --> 00:58:20.741
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1300
00:58:20.741 --> 00:58:21.574
<v Speaker 1>you're experiencing how these people </v>
<v Speaker 1>taught their kids and what the result </v>

1301
00:58:24.461 --> 00:58:27.870
<v Speaker 1>was because you're around the kids all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time and not around your parents.</v>

1302
00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:31.660
<v Speaker 1>they say that you're raised by your </v>
<v Speaker 1>peers after the age of 12 year.</v>

1303
00:58:31.661 --> 00:58:33.460
<v Speaker 1>Basically your parents are out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1304
00:58:33.670 --> 00:58:34.930
<v Speaker 1>You're raised by your peers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1305
00:58:34.931 --> 00:58:36.730
<v Speaker 1>You're constantly with your friends in </v>
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>

1306
00:58:36.731 --> 00:58:39.130
<v Speaker 1>You're constantly with your friends in </v>
<v Speaker 1>any activities you have.</v>

1307
00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:42.180
<v Speaker 1>You're looking for their validation </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of your parents validate.</v>

1308
00:58:42.181 --> 00:58:44.440
<v Speaker 1>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and with My friends it was always,</v>

1309
00:58:44.441 --> 00:58:45.760
<v Speaker 1>who's the sickest fuck?</v>

1310
00:58:46.380 --> 00:58:48.030
<v Speaker 1>Mike's a sick fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1311
00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:50.110

1312
00:58:50.111 --> 00:58:54.100
<v Speaker 1>he's crazy and there was a value in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>because everybody was scared.</v>

1313
00:58:54.130 --> 00:58:55.390
<v Speaker 1>That waS really at the bottom line of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1314
00:58:55.391 --> 00:59:00.100
<v Speaker 1>We're all young men and we're on our way</v>
<v Speaker 1>to becoming adults and no one knows what</v>

1315
00:59:00.101 --> 00:59:00.934
<v Speaker 1>the fuck they're going to do and we have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few friends that have graduated </v>

1316
00:59:02.381 --> 00:59:04.190
<v Speaker 1>highschool and they're losers now and </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1317
00:59:04.270 --> 00:59:05.560
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that might be me.</v>

1318
00:59:05.830 --> 00:59:08.890
<v Speaker 1>Like that was the big cloud that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>always hanging over everybody's head.</v>

1319
00:59:08.891 --> 00:59:11.020
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing after high school?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing after high school?</v>

1320
00:59:11.290 --> 00:59:15.040
<v Speaker 1>And it was like this impending date of </v>
<v Speaker 1>doom that was coming up.</v>

1321
00:59:15.041 --> 00:59:17.890
<v Speaker 1>So everybody was scared all the time and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody wanted to be.</v>

1322
00:59:17.891 --> 00:59:18.724
<v Speaker 1>They wanted to be a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody they wanted to prove </v>

1323
00:59:19.901 --> 00:59:20.734
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wanted it to be somethinG special </v>

1324
00:59:21.801 --> 00:59:23.090
<v Speaker 1>and no one felt special.</v>

1325
00:59:23.470 --> 00:59:25.910
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody felt like fucking loser,</v>

1326
00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:27.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all like waitinG,</v>

1327
00:59:27.950 --> 00:59:28.783
<v Speaker 1>waiting to become an adult so you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>get a job like all these other people </v>

<v Speaker 1>or figuring out a way to escape he had.</v>

1329
00:59:35.961 --> 00:59:37.940
<v Speaker 1>Then there's always the community </v>

<v Speaker 1>like people go,</v>

1333
00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:44.960
<v Speaker 1>THat's going to be one semester and out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did that.</v>

1334
00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:47.750
<v Speaker 1>I went to massbay massbay community </v>
<v Speaker 1>college.</v>

1335
00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:51.230
<v Speaker 1>I did it after a whole year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took a whole year off and I just,</v>

1336
00:59:51.590 --> 00:59:52.423
<v Speaker 1>I only went back to school because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't want people thinking I was a </v>

1337
00:59:55.041 --> 00:59:58.250
<v Speaker 1>loser,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I did like maybe one semester at mass</v>

1338
00:59:58.251 --> 00:59:59.084
<v Speaker 1>bay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even think I finished the </v>

1339
00:59:59.211 --> 01:00:01.430
<v Speaker 1>semester and then I left and went to </v>
<v Speaker 1>umass.</v>

1340
01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:04.550
<v Speaker 1>Umass boston had this like adult </v>
<v Speaker 1>education program.</v>

1341
01:00:04.550 --> 01:00:05.383
<v Speaker 1>we didn't have to have a ged or a not </v>
<v Speaker 1>gad sat because I never took my sats </v>

1342
01:00:09.110 --> 01:00:10.430
<v Speaker 1>because when I graduated from high </v>
<v Speaker 1>school I'm like,</v>

1343
01:00:10.431 --> 01:00:11.720
<v Speaker 1>I am never going to school again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1344
01:00:11.721 --> 01:00:12.554
<v Speaker 1>fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I got so tired of feeling like a </v>

1345
01:00:14.241 --> 01:00:16.230
<v Speaker 1>fucking loser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like wHen I tell people is take,</v>

1346
01:00:16.310 --> 01:00:17.780
<v Speaker 1>I would always say I was taking a year </v>
<v Speaker 1>off,</v>

1347
01:00:17.870 --> 01:00:19.700
<v Speaker 1>took a year off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it really,</v>

1348
01:00:19.701 --> 01:00:20.534
<v Speaker 1>I just had no directioN I was doing was </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing martial arts and competing and I </v>

1349
01:00:24.681 --> 01:00:27.560
<v Speaker 1>just was so terrified of what the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>the future lead.</v>

1350
01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:32.800
<v Speaker 1>And so I went to umass for like three </v>
<v Speaker 1>Years but not like three full years.</v>

1351
01:00:33.610 --> 01:00:37.820
<v Speaker 1>It was like there was still a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>credits to be acquired if I was going to</v>

1352
01:00:37.821 --> 01:00:42.110
<v Speaker 1>graduate and I just was wasting my time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was barely paying attention.</v>

1353
01:00:42.111 --> 01:00:42.944
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was completely half asking whatever </v>

1354
01:00:44.451 --> 01:00:45.200
<v Speaker 1>project we had.</v>

1355
01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:46.400
<v Speaker 1>And then I was realizing like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what am I,</v>

1356
01:00:46.430 --> 01:00:47.490
<v Speaker 1>why am I wasting my time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1357
01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:48.620
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1358
01:00:48.630 --> 01:00:49.463
<v Speaker 1>I got some letter saying that I couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>come back With the grades that I had </v>

1359
01:00:54.830 --> 01:00:58.130
<v Speaker 1>unless I came up with some very </v>
<v Speaker 1>compelling reason.</v>

1360
01:00:58.340 --> 01:00:59.173
<v Speaker 1>So they wanted me to make an arguMent </v>
<v Speaker 1>for why they should include me back in </v>

1361
01:01:02.181 --> 01:01:03.014
<v Speaker 1>the class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I wrote out in handwritten because </v>

1362
01:01:05.481 --> 01:01:06.950
<v Speaker 1>back then no one had a fuckin </v>
<v Speaker 1>typewriter,</v>

1363
01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:11.360
<v Speaker 1>thiS total bullshit letter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this ridiculous,</v>

1364
01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:16.660
<v Speaker 1>like a persuasive bullshitty letter </v>
<v Speaker 1>about how important education is to me.</v>

1365
01:01:18.351 --> 01:01:19.184
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like how important it means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I realized like the amount of </v>

1366
01:01:22.791 --> 01:01:27.791
<v Speaker 1>effort that I put writing this bullshit </v>
<v Speaker 1>letter to keep these people from kicking</v>

1367
01:01:27.981 --> 01:01:28.814
<v Speaker 1>me out of their school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I wasn't paying attention to far </v>

1368
01:01:30.951 --> 01:01:34.850
<v Speaker 1>exceeds any effort that I ever put on </v>
<v Speaker 1>any project ever in class.</v>

1369
01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:35.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1370
01:01:35.390 --> 01:01:36.260
<v Speaker 1>And then I realized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1371
01:01:36.261 --> 01:01:39.590
<v Speaker 1>whatever I'm going to Do with my life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to involve doing.</v>

1372
01:01:39.591 --> 01:01:40.424
<v Speaker 1>This is not going to involve someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>else dictating my schedule for whatever </v>

1373
01:01:44.181 --> 01:01:45.140
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>

1374
01:01:45.141 --> 01:01:48.830
<v Speaker 1>clearly I can write clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can really think maybe common.</v>

1375
01:01:48.831 --> 01:01:49.221
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1376
01:01:49.221 --> 01:01:50.810
<v Speaker 1>I had a conversation with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1377
01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:52.880
<v Speaker 1>a science teacher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the science teacher,</v>

1378
01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:54.440
<v Speaker 1>and it was the same kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1379
01:01:54.860 --> 01:01:58.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm mocked him in class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily mocked him,</v>

1380
01:01:58.580 --> 01:02:02.270
<v Speaker 1>but I brought up something that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>contrary to what he was teaching.</v>

1381
01:02:02.570 --> 01:02:05.300
<v Speaker 1>He was talking about a lake erie being a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dead lake.</v>

1382
01:02:05.301 --> 01:02:06.021
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen man,</v>

1383
01:02:06.021 --> 01:02:06.854
<v Speaker 1>they had a documentary on pbs last night</v>
<v Speaker 1>about lake erie making a resurgence and </v>

1384
01:02:10.131 --> 01:02:14.270
<v Speaker 1>these scientists have figured out these </v>
<v Speaker 1>new ways to minimize water pollution and</v>

1385
01:02:14.271 --> 01:02:16.250
<v Speaker 1>all this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like other kIds looking at me like,</v>

1386
01:02:16.251 --> 01:02:17.084
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

1387
01:02:17.250 --> 01:02:20.610
<v Speaker 1>And he got pissed at me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got really pissed at me and he said,</v>

1388
01:02:20.611 --> 01:02:22.630
<v Speaker 1>you're undermining my class and this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>not a go,</v>

1389
01:02:22.631 --> 01:02:24.540
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're teaching old shit.</v>

1390
01:02:25.570 --> 01:02:27.240
<v Speaker 1>This is on tv man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This on tv.</v>

1391
01:02:27.241 --> 01:02:28.900
<v Speaker 1>Like Yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1392
01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:29.873
<v Speaker 1>And I had a conversation with them </v>
<v Speaker 1>afterwards and because I had to talk to </v>

1393
01:02:34.621 --> 01:02:35.454
<v Speaker 1>him in order to get back in the class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he kicked me out of class and he said </v>

1394
01:02:37.891 --> 01:02:38.641
<v Speaker 1>two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

1395
01:02:38.641 --> 01:02:39.870
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

1396
01:02:39.871 --> 01:02:44.400
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know whether or not that was the</v>

1397
01:02:44.401 --> 01:02:45.234
<v Speaker 1>case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether or not it's true and if I allow </v>

1398
01:02:46.861 --> 01:02:49.230
<v Speaker 1>you to just interrupt my class and chime</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1399
01:02:49.231 --> 01:02:52.980
<v Speaker 1>something like that and it's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't fact checked it.</v>

1400
01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:53.833
<v Speaker 1>You're telling the whole class and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know if you're right or you're </v>

1401
01:02:56.041 --> 01:02:58.440
<v Speaker 1>wrong or you're making things up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're interrupting my class.</v>

1402
01:02:58.530 --> 01:02:59.363
<v Speaker 1>That's the point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have something to tell me about </v>

1403
01:03:00.271 --> 01:03:01.104
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you could tell me about it after </v>

1404
01:03:02.011 --> 01:03:02.844
<v Speaker 1>the class and then I can go and look it </v>
<v Speaker 1>up and then maybe I can correct the </v>

1405
01:03:05.281 --> 01:03:06.114
<v Speaker 1>class he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to in interrupting the class you </v>

1406
01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:13.230
<v Speaker 1>showed yourself to be more articulate </v>
<v Speaker 1>and more intelligent the you ever showed</v>

1407
01:03:13.231 --> 01:03:17.090
<v Speaker 1>ever in the entire semester.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're totally half housing.</v>

1408
01:03:17.100 --> 01:03:19.950
<v Speaker 1>Everything you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're writing everything in paper.</v>

1409
01:03:19.951 --> 01:03:20.784
<v Speaker 1>You turn in every test you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time I call upon you for a </v>

1410
01:03:23.071 --> 01:03:25.380
<v Speaker 1>question totally half that have asked </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1411
01:03:25.410 --> 01:03:27.510
<v Speaker 1>but when you wanted to correct me on </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

1412
01:03:27.511 --> 01:03:28.344
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden you knew all the words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You knew how to form the sentence </v>

1413
01:03:30.061 --> 01:03:32.640
<v Speaker 1>correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to say with the right impact.</v>

1414
01:03:32.850 --> 01:03:33.930
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just.</v>

1415
01:03:33.931 --> 01:03:35.580
<v Speaker 1>Your focus is off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1416
01:03:35.610 --> 01:03:37.200
<v Speaker 1>god damn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that dude's on the money,</v>

1417
01:03:37.650 --> 01:03:38.670
<v Speaker 1>and I realized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1418
01:03:38.671 --> 01:03:40.410
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm not stupid,</v>

1419
01:03:40.820 --> 01:03:41.653
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just can't.</v>

1420
01:03:41.730 --> 01:03:43.820
<v Speaker 1>I can't listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't do it.</v>

1421
01:03:43.830 --> 01:03:45.330
<v Speaker 5>They're way I got to do it my way</v>

1422
01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:46.990
<v Speaker 1>could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just didn't.</v>

1423
01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:47.913
<v Speaker 1>I grew up not having any direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So someone doesn't tell you what to do </v>

1424
01:03:51.430 --> 01:03:53.890
<v Speaker 1>all your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like essentially you just out free.</v>

1425
01:03:53.891 --> 01:03:54.724
<v Speaker 1>I would go fishing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd hang out with my friends in the </v>

1426
01:03:56.051 --> 01:03:56.884
<v Speaker 1>fucking woods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just go find shit to do and then all </v>

1427
01:03:59.211 --> 01:04:00.044
<v Speaker 1>of a sudden you're in school and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>telling you everything you have to do </v>

1428
01:04:01.751 --> 01:04:02.231
<v Speaker 1>all day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1429
01:04:02.231 --> 01:04:03.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm not ready for that.</v>

1430
01:04:03.390 --> 01:04:05.990
<v Speaker 5>I'm not really that like you're sitting </v>
<v Speaker 5>in.</v>

1431
01:04:06.030 --> 01:04:08.550
<v Speaker 5>I'm fucking shocked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When my kid tells me about it,</v>

1432

<v Speaker 5>Then we get five minutes off and we go </v>

1458
01:05:29.171 --> 01:05:30.004
<v Speaker 1>What'd you the idea of letting those </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids get trapped in that system where </v>

1459
01:05:34.391 --> 01:05:35.224
<v Speaker 1>all day you're just doing that and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you get sitting passively and then you </v>

1460
01:05:38.711 --> 01:05:40.660
<v Speaker 1>get out and you have more work to do at </v>
<v Speaker 1>home.</v>

1461
01:05:40.990 --> 01:05:43.630
<v Speaker 1>That just sort of eliminated any social </v>
<v Speaker 1>life you might have,</v>

1462
01:05:43.730 --> 01:05:44.563
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would think that that would be </v>

1463
01:05:45.041 --> 01:05:49.220
<v Speaker 1>enough that going to school from seven </v>
<v Speaker 1>to three eveRy fucking day or whatever.</v>

<v Speaker 5>The average person that's working,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that a cubicle?</v>

1469

01:06:56.780 --> 01:06:59.640
<v Speaker 1>back in the fucking office and this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the greatest job of all time.</v>

1494
01:07:00.010 --> 01:07:01.920
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if you're selling insurance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1495
01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:04.560
<v Speaker 1>or hyundai's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're really coming down on an insurance</v>

1496
01:07:04.561 --> 01:07:05.430
<v Speaker 1>salesman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why.</v>

1497
01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:08.280
<v Speaker 1>Attack premise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's easy to ship on.</v>

1498
01:07:08.340 --> 01:07:09.173
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1499
01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:11.113
<v Speaker 5>insurance is an interesting gig because </v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're on the side where you're </v>

1500
01:07:14.481 --> 01:07:17.780
<v Speaker 5>writing policies and you're coming up at</v>
<v Speaker 5>the fucking numbers on like.</v>

1501
01:07:17.930 --> 01:07:19.910
<v Speaker 5>Because I remember when I was at boston </v>
<v Speaker 5>university,</v>

1502
01:07:20.330 --> 01:07:21.163
<v Speaker 5>there was a guy at the entity in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>aDministration that had figured out the </v>

1503
01:07:23.901 --> 01:07:24.734
<v Speaker 5>insurance policies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can take out insurance policies on </v>

1504
01:07:28.310 --> 01:07:30.440
<v Speaker 5>every student in the university,</v>

1505
01:07:31.310 --> 01:07:32.143
<v Speaker 1>pay for them,</v>

1506
01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:36.780
<v Speaker 5>and then the policies would pay back to </v>
<v Speaker 5>boston university if you die.</v>

1507
01:07:36.781 --> 01:07:37.614
<v Speaker 5>There were life insurance policies </v>
<v Speaker 5>because this guy looked at the numbers </v>

1508
01:07:39.721 --> 01:07:41.360
<v Speaker 5>and crunch them and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what?</v>

1509
01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:44.380
<v Speaker 1>This is a fucking great deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

1510
01:07:44.740 --> 01:07:47.500
<v Speaker 1>These kids fucking dIe more often than </v>
<v Speaker 1>the insurance company thinks.</v>

1511
01:07:47.910 --> 01:07:51.210
<v Speaker 5>So they literally took out insurance </v>
<v Speaker 5>policies on 30,000 kids.</v>

1512
01:07:51.240 --> 01:07:52.073
<v Speaker 5>That's unsaleable back to the university</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it was a big blow up in the </v>

1513
01:07:54.571 --> 01:07:57.240
<v Speaker 5>newspaper about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was making jokes when I was like,</v>

1514
01:07:57.270 --> 01:07:58.103
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was wondering why they took all the </v>

1515
01:07:58.351 --> 01:07:59.580
<v Speaker 5>traffic lights and on commonwealth.</v>

1516
01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:04.870
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>

1517
01:08:05.110 --> 01:08:07.360
<v Speaker 1>They.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They celebrate money when you die.</v>

1518
01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:09.880
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A bunch of fucking assholes.</v>

1519
01:08:10.020 --> 01:08:11.860
<v Speaker 1>That's what people used to do when there</v>
<v Speaker 1>was no internet.</v>

1520
01:08:12.260 --> 01:08:14.800
<v Speaker 1>Get away with doing shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one knew about it for.</v>

1521
01:08:15.380 --> 01:08:16.213
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

1522
01:08:16.370 --> 01:08:17.203
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They probably didn't know about it </v>

1523
01:08:17.421 --> 01:08:18.254
<v Speaker 2>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody had to probably blow the </v>

1524
01:08:18.711 --> 01:08:23.300
<v Speaker 2>whistle while they was a good student </v>
<v Speaker 2>newspaper in boston at bu,</v>

1525
01:08:23.330 --> 01:08:24.163
<v Speaker 2>but you had a great paper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was one of the best ones In the </v>

1526
01:08:25.821 --> 01:08:30.290
<v Speaker 2>country and they cracked the case and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they also were very political.</v>

1527
01:08:30.291 --> 01:08:35.291
<v Speaker 2>We protested against apartheid and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>they wouldn't allow.</v>

1528
01:08:35.930 --> 01:08:36.763
<v Speaker 2>They wouldn't allow opposite sex </v>
<v Speaker 2>students to sleep in the in somebody's </v>

1529
01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:42.493
<v Speaker 2>room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they had no overnight policy at bu </v>

1530
01:08:45.951 --> 01:08:49.160
<v Speaker 2>like in fucking 1989.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

1531
01:08:49.250 --> 01:08:50.083
<v Speaker 2>So there was protests about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is also really fucking weird </v>

1532
01:08:52.791 --> 01:08:56.210
<v Speaker 2>because what about gay people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Woo.</v>

1533
01:08:56.260 --> 01:08:57.500
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can just bang it up.</v>

1534
01:08:57.530 --> 01:08:58.363
<v Speaker 2>They can pay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guys can literally fuck each other </v>

1535
01:09:01.610 --> 01:09:02.870
<v Speaker 2>in the ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No problem.</v>

1536
01:09:03.050 --> 01:09:04.280
<v Speaker 2>No problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hang it up.</v>

1537
01:09:04.430 --> 01:09:05.263
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably a few problems wIth a few </v>

1538
01:09:06.321 --> 01:09:07.820
<v Speaker 2>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hemorrhoids.</v>

1539
01:09:07.821 --> 01:09:10.440
<v Speaker 2>And remember when you used to get the </v>
<v Speaker 2>girl that had a,</v>

1540
01:09:10.441 --> 01:09:15.310
<v Speaker 2>a dorm used to find the time where her </v>
<v Speaker 2>roommate agreed to be out of the room so</v>

1541
01:09:15.311 --> 01:09:16.144
<v Speaker 2>you fuck right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you would come back into the room </v>

1542
01:09:18.140 --> 01:09:21.930
<v Speaker 2>after the roommate fucked and it just </v>
<v Speaker 2>smelled like a fucking wall</v>

1543
01:09:22.140 --> 01:09:25.910
<v Speaker 1>asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like cheeses.</v>

1544
01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:29.520
<v Speaker 1>No ventilation window done in this room.</v>

1545
01:09:35.940 --> 01:09:37.420
<v Speaker 1>That that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the other smells.</v>

1546
01:09:37.421 --> 01:09:39.640
<v Speaker 1>The smell with first.</v>

1549
01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:43.353
<v Speaker 1>people were wiping their ass and back </v>
<v Speaker 1>then no one even shaved girls had </v>

<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

1552
01:09:51.510 --> 01:09:54.160
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People just smudge that shit after.</v>

1553
01:09:54.370 --> 01:09:55.780
<v Speaker 1>After they poop,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's been off the grid for three months </v>

1603
01:12:20.681 --> 01:12:22.210
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody knows where he is.</v>

1604
01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:23.561
<v Speaker 1>Are you serious?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1605
01:12:23.561 --> 01:12:27.230
<v Speaker 1>there's pictures of him in Vietnam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people have found them in Vietnam.</v>

1606
01:12:27.231 --> 01:12:28.750
<v Speaker 1>They took pictures with them and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>put it online.</v>

1607
01:12:29.370 --> 01:12:30.460
<v Speaker 1>No shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

1608
01:12:30.580 --> 01:12:32.860
<v Speaker 1>He shut off his phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't accept incoming calls.</v>

1609
01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:34.780
<v Speaker 1>He is not answering emails.</v>

1610
01:12:34.900 --> 01:12:36.640
<v Speaker 1>He told comedy central,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>

1611
01:12:36.641 --> 01:12:38.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm disappearing for three months to </v>
<v Speaker 1>laws.</v>

1612
01:12:38.521 --> 01:12:39.680
<v Speaker 1>Friends told us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1613
01:12:39.810 --> 01:12:42.280

<v Speaker 1>I don't know how long it's going to go.</v>

1614
01:12:42.281 --> 01:12:43.340
<v Speaker 1>Have fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

1615
01:12:43.341 --> 01:12:46.120
<v Speaker 1>I just Want to disconnect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it just completely disconnected.</v>

1616
01:12:46.121 --> 01:12:48.010
<v Speaker 1>He's been traveling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long ago was this?</v>

1617
01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:51.170
<v Speaker 1>Three months ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did a podcast with Henry Rollins.</v>

1618
01:12:51.420 --> 01:12:54.550
<v Speaker 1>This is where he fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a podcast with Henry Rollins.</v>

1619
01:12:54.700 --> 01:12:58.360
<v Speaker 1>Henry rollins is a fascinating guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating guy.</v>

1620
01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:00.730
<v Speaker 1>Angry motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's very angry.</v>

1621
01:13:00.790 --> 01:13:01.623
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you talked to him and you get </v>

1622
01:13:04.691 --> 01:13:07.120
<v Speaker 1>to know his story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the pieces sort of fall into place.</v>

1623
01:13:07.390 --> 01:13:09.470
<v Speaker 1>He was one of the earliest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1624
01:13:09.550 --> 01:13:13.450
<v Speaker 1>children that they put on prozac or </v>
<v Speaker 1>ritalin,</v>

1625
01:13:13.451 --> 01:13:14.980
<v Speaker 1>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ritalin.</v>

1626
01:13:15.460 --> 01:13:18.580
<v Speaker 1>They put him on ritalin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is speed when he was really young,</v>

1627
01:13:18.670 --> 01:13:19.503
<v Speaker 1>like five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he would talk about how he'd go </v>

1628
01:13:21.701 --> 01:13:22.534
<v Speaker 1>to school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just white knuckling until the ritalin </v>

1629
01:13:24.941 --> 01:13:25.630
<v Speaker 1>were off.</v>

1630
01:13:25.630 --> 01:13:27.880
<v Speaker 1>The ritalin would wear off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like at the end of the day,</v>

1631
01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:29.193
<v Speaker 1>we finally calmed down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So his whole life he was just like </v>

1632
01:13:31.870 --> 01:13:32.703
<v Speaker 1>jacked up on speed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like his development cycle was kinda </v>

1633
01:13:36.131 --> 01:13:39.460
<v Speaker 1>like impaired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but jacked up on speed in my opinion.</v>

1634
01:13:39.490 --> 01:13:41.080
<v Speaker 1>The way he describes it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand how.</v>

1635
01:13:41.410 --> 01:13:42.243
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not a rational argument to me </v>

1636
01:13:44.170 --> 01:13:45.003
<v Speaker 1>that they wouldn't have any significant </v>
<v Speaker 1>impact on his life being on speed all </v>

1637
01:13:48.911 --> 01:13:51.760
<v Speaker 1>throughout his childhood years until he </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovered exercise,</v>

1638
01:13:52.020 --> 01:13:52.853
<v Speaker 1>start to exercise in high school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he slowly got off the ritalin and </v>

1639
01:13:54.601 --> 01:13:55.434
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so he's developmentally like that </v>

1640
01:13:58.451 --> 01:14:01.330
<v Speaker 1>was challenGed in a lot of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's a fascinating guy,</v>

1641
01:14:01.331 --> 01:14:04.000
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just picks a spot on a map like bali.</v>

1642
01:14:04.030 --> 01:14:05.230
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go see boli.</v>

1643
01:14:05.350 --> 01:14:06.300
<v Speaker 1>Henry rollins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1644
01:14:06.370 --> 01:14:08.010
<v Speaker 1>by himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just goes there,</v>

1645
01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:10.170
<v Speaker 1>brings a laptop so you can write,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brings cameras.</v>

1646
01:14:10.180 --> 01:14:12.100
<v Speaker 1>We can take pictures and writes now</v>

1647
01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:14.350
<v Speaker 4>and just does that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Travels all over the world.</v>

1648
01:14:14.380 --> 01:14:15.213
<v Speaker 4>Just goes to all these different places.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He goes and hangs out with bedouins in </v>

1649
01:14:17.921 --> 01:14:19.150
<v Speaker 4>the desert.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

1650
01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:21.100
<v Speaker 4>listens to weird,</v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy music.</v>

1651
01:14:21.110 --> 01:14:21.943
<v Speaker 4>These people are making and sweared </v>
<v Speaker 4>culture so just shows up and africa </v>

1652
01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:26.560
<v Speaker 4>shows up in all these different places.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just goes there,</v>

1653
01:14:26.561 --> 01:14:27.394
<v Speaker 4>flies in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So ari has them on his podcast and I </v>

1654
01:14:29.111 --> 01:14:29.944
<v Speaker 4>think our.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was so compelled by the idea of just </v>

1655
01:14:31.691 --> 01:14:34.940
<v Speaker 4>completely this picking a spot and going</v>
<v Speaker 4>that are.</v>

1656
01:14:34.941 --> 01:14:36.970
<v Speaker 4>He decided for his.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because you.</v>

1657
01:14:37.220 --> 01:14:39.590
<v Speaker 4>He's like super cognizant about africa </v>
<v Speaker 4>does a special.</v>

1658
01:14:39.591 --> 01:14:43.300
<v Speaker 4>Like he needs more material.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what he does is he filmed a special,</v>

1659
01:14:43.420 --> 01:14:44.560
<v Speaker 4>filmed it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>edited it,</v>

1660
01:14:44.830 --> 01:14:45.663
<v Speaker 4>and then disappeared and then just </v>
<v Speaker 4>vanished for like three months as of </v>

1661
01:14:48.431 --> 01:14:49.300
<v Speaker 4>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>three months.</v>

1662
01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:52.870
<v Speaker 4>And what's your theory on where he is?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't have one.</v>

1663
01:14:53.170 --> 01:14:54.003
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna wait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna wait until he comes back and </v>

1664
01:14:55.181 --> 01:14:56.770
<v Speaker 4>then I'm going to talk to them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>see what's up.</v>

1665
01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:58.030
<v Speaker 4>And he might not even want to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1666
01:14:58.470 --> 01:15:00.010
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's such a,</v>

1667
01:15:00.220 --> 01:15:04.480
<v Speaker 4>he's such an interesting guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He might just decide how a good time you</v>

1668
01:15:04.481 --> 01:15:06.060
<v Speaker 4>don't want to talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that'd be like,</v>

1669
01:15:06.070 --> 01:15:07.480
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1670
01:15:07.540 --> 01:15:08.373
<v Speaker 4>and maybe he'll decide that the great </v>
<v Speaker 4>experiences would best be reserved for </v>

1671
01:15:12.011 --> 01:15:13.180
<v Speaker 4>the stage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he met.</v>

1672
01:15:13.181 --> 01:15:16.030
<v Speaker 4>He might have like cultivated some </v>
<v Speaker 4>really good experiences.</v>

1673
01:15:16.031 --> 01:15:18.730
<v Speaker 4>He wants to only get about on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a weird guy,</v>

1674
01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:19.680
<v Speaker 4>but in the best</v>

1675
01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:21.600
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the best way.</v>

1676
01:15:21.601 --> 01:15:22.434
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a sense of fairness about him </v>

1677
01:15:23.611 --> 01:15:24.444
<v Speaker 3>also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I remember because I did his show </v>

1678
01:15:26.191 --> 01:15:27.024
<v Speaker 3>last season and we did rehearsal for it </v>
<v Speaker 3>at the comedy store in the belly room </v>

1679
01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:32.520
<v Speaker 3>and all of a sudden you get this fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>nice check</v>

1680
01:15:33.550 --> 01:15:34.390
<v Speaker 3>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh no,</v>

1681
01:15:34.391 --> 01:15:35.224
<v Speaker 3>our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wanted all you guys to split this </v>

1682
01:15:37.301 --> 01:15:40.810
<v Speaker 3>money and then I did another show from </v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere else and it was like,</v>

1683
01:15:40.990 --> 01:15:41.501
<v Speaker 3>I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1684
01:15:41.501 --> 01:15:42.334
<v Speaker 3>you do the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he does it to a point where it's </v>

1685
01:15:44.591 --> 01:15:49.300
<v Speaker 3>like he's very aware of being as fair as</v>
<v Speaker 3>possible.</v>

1686
01:15:49.420 --> 01:15:53.530
<v Speaker 3>So like when we did his tv show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he gave us all a gift.</v>

1687
01:15:53.650 --> 01:15:56.170
<v Speaker 3>I won't say what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

1688
01:15:56.260 --> 01:15:57.093
<v Speaker 3>it was illegal and every single person </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was expensive and every single </v>

1689
01:16:01.241 --> 01:16:02.074
<v Speaker 3>person got this gift.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he's very thoughtful about that </v>

1690
01:16:04.211 --> 01:16:05.044
<v Speaker 3>kind of shit.</v>

1691
01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:07.470
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's just an awesome guy.</v>

1692
01:16:08.370 --> 01:16:11.820
<v Speaker 4>When I met him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was an open miker raw open miker just</v>

1693
01:16:11.821 --> 01:16:12.770
<v Speaker 4>started,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1694
01:16:12.900 --> 01:16:15.330
<v Speaker 4>Young guy just got the store working as </v>
<v Speaker 4>a doorman.</v>

1695
01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:17.273
<v Speaker 4>And then one day I was supposed to take </v>
<v Speaker 4>Mike Young with me and Mike Young was </v>

1696
01:16:20.731 --> 01:16:23.760
<v Speaker 4>doing the road with me a little bit and </v>
<v Speaker 4>michael and couldn't make it.</v>

1697
01:16:24.300 --> 01:16:25.133
<v Speaker 4>So uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I took ari and he had never really been </v>

1698
01:16:28.531 --> 01:16:29.700

<v Speaker 4>a truly independent</v>

1716

1830
01:21:58.011 --> 01:21:58.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>karen killed.</v>

1831
01:21:58.710 --> 01:22:02.800
<v Speaker 3>Gareth has that podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a my favorite murder.</v>

1832
01:22:03.010 --> 01:22:03.843
<v Speaker 3>Is that all about murders?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every week they talk about a different </v>

1833
01:22:06.700 --> 01:22:08.760
<v Speaker 3>gruesome murder to class.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1834
01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.540
<v Speaker 3>it's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

1835
01:22:11.050 --> 01:22:15.970
<v Speaker 3>but what is it about us that like I love</v>
<v Speaker 3>the iceman cometh and uh,</v>

1836
01:22:15.971 --> 01:22:16.804
<v Speaker 3>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was another one that was about a </v>

1837
01:22:17.531 --> 01:22:19.410
<v Speaker 3>serial killer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean just earlier talking about the,</v>

1838
01:22:19.411 --> 01:22:20.244
<v Speaker 3>the angel of death guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what is it about us that is so </v>

1839
01:22:23.291 --> 01:22:25.900
<v Speaker 3>interested in people that take human </v>
<v Speaker 3>life?</v>

1840
01:22:25.901 --> 01:22:30.070
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that it's like a part of us</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's an unexpressed thing?</v>

1841
01:22:30.071 --> 01:22:32.410
<v Speaker 3>Like if we were cavemen we would kill,</v>

1842
01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:36.570
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a lot of energy attached</v>

1843
01:22:36.571 --> 01:22:38.100
<v Speaker 4>to it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>meaning negative,</v>

1844
01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:39.660
<v Speaker 4>negative energy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but still energy,</v>

1845
01:22:39.661 --> 01:22:40.494
<v Speaker 4>like you can't look away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the same reason why you watch like </v>

1846
01:22:42.841 --> 01:22:43.674
<v Speaker 4>car accidents or you watch youtube </v>
<v Speaker 4>videos about someone doing a stunt that </v>

1847
01:22:46.561 --> 01:22:49.020
<v Speaker 4>goes wrong and they accidentally drive </v>
<v Speaker 4>off a bridge.</v>

1848
01:22:49.410 --> 01:22:50.760
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you've ever seen the one</v>

1849
01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:54.930
<v Speaker 4>with the guy in the wing suit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tries to buzz a bridge and he calculates</v>

1850
01:22:54.931 --> 01:22:56.960
<v Speaker 4>it wrongly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>slams into the bridge.</v>

1851
01:22:56.990 --> 01:23:00.390
<v Speaker 4>It sounds like a fucking car accident.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He slammed in the bridge going like,</v>

1852
01:23:00.391 --> 01:23:01.224
<v Speaker 4>who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 4>150 miles an hour or something crazy </v>

1853
01:23:02.731 --> 01:23:04.200
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's horrific.</v>

1854
01:23:05.110 --> 01:23:07.070
<v Speaker 4>Just fall straight down in the water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1855
01:23:07.230 --> 01:23:10.090
<v Speaker 4>I mean he hit the bridge so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He might've just.</v>

1856
01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:11.740
<v Speaker 4>I mean he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if he didn't have a suit on,</v>

1857
01:23:12.190 --> 01:23:15.570
<v Speaker 4>he might have just exploded into like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>ball of jello or something,</v>

1858
01:23:15.580 --> 01:23:16.413
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But because he had the suit on and kind </v>

1859
01:23:17.331 --> 01:23:20.140
<v Speaker 4>of kept all the blood and body parts in </v>
<v Speaker 4>place.</v>

1860
01:23:20.170 --> 01:23:21.580
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he hit it so hard.</v>

1861
01:23:21.581 --> 01:23:23.730
<v Speaker 4>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it literally sounds like a,</v>

1862
01:23:23.830 --> 01:23:27.490
<v Speaker 4>like a car accident because he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>slamming into the metal of the bridge at</v>

1863
01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:31.000
<v Speaker 4>100 fucking whatever miles an hour with </v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing on but a helmet.</v>

1864
01:23:31.030 --> 01:23:33.820
<v Speaker 4>Do you regret having seen that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like does that in your mind?</v>

1865
01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:35.290
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

1866
01:23:36.830 --> 01:23:38.330
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not pleasant,</v>

1867
01:23:38.900 --> 01:23:40.490
<v Speaker 4>but there's something about those </v>
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

1868
01:23:40.500 --> 01:23:42.620
<v Speaker 4>It's like there's an energy attached.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh jesus.</v>

1869
01:23:42.650 --> 01:23:43.483
<v Speaker 4>Oh jesus.</v>

<v Speaker 4>just have no way to stop your </v>

<v Speaker 4>You can't even cut back.</v>

01:25:07.250 --> 01:25:11.700
<v Speaker 4>Ooh son.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not good.</v>

1891
01:25:11.820 --> 01:25:12.653
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen it's like america's funniest </v>

1892
01:25:14.371 --> 01:25:16.440
<v Speaker 4>home videos for grownups.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly,</v>

1893
01:25:16.860 --> 01:25:19.620
<v Speaker 4>but I never got into watching the faces </v>
<v Speaker 4>of death and shit like that.</v>

1894
01:25:19.621 --> 01:25:21.210
<v Speaker 4>Although a lot of those I think were </v>
<v Speaker 4>fake,</v>

1895
01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:23.400
<v Speaker 4>but there are obviously beheadings I've </v>
<v Speaker 4>never.</v>

1896
01:25:23.401 --> 01:25:25.750
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever watched a beheading?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have good.</v>

1897
01:25:25.850 --> 01:25:27.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't regret it.</v>

1898
01:25:27.900 --> 01:25:30.220
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but why do people watch them again?</v>

1899
01:25:30.221 --> 01:25:31.500
<v Speaker 4>It's because there's energy attached to </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1900
01:25:31.501 --> 01:25:33.480
<v Speaker 4>You know there's a consequence of what's</v>
<v Speaker 4>happening.</v>

1901
01:25:33.510 --> 01:25:35.220
<v Speaker 4>you're watching something you're gonna </v>
<v Speaker 4>have.</v>

1902
01:25:35.221 --> 01:25:37.350
<v Speaker 4>The consequence doesn't really manifest </v>
<v Speaker 4>itself.</v>

1903
01:25:37.351 --> 01:25:40.500
<v Speaker 4>Like watching people do balancing acts </v>
<v Speaker 4>on the top of skyscrapers.</v>

1904
01:25:40.850 --> 01:25:41.683
<v Speaker 4>Even if you know they survived,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is how you got the footage in the </v>

1905
01:25:43.111 --> 01:25:45.180
<v Speaker 4>first place,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it still freaks you the fuck out.</v>

1906
01:25:45.870 --> 01:25:48.780
<v Speaker 4>I can't stop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know Kelly Slater,</v>

1907
01:25:48.781 --> 01:25:51.300
<v Speaker 4>the surfer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he sends me those.</v>

1908
01:25:51.450 --> 01:25:52.283
<v Speaker 4>He knows like they freaked me out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we send each other back and forth </v>

1909
01:25:55.140 --> 01:25:58.740
<v Speaker 4>fucked up videos about dudes doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>balancing acts on the side of buildings.</v>

1910
01:25:58.770 --> 01:26:01.290
<v Speaker 4>Like what the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't watch those man.</v>

1911
01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:04.850
<v Speaker 4>My hands start sweating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My asshole starts squeezing.</v>

1912
01:26:04.851 --> 01:26:07.190
<v Speaker 4>I just go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck are you doing?</v>

<v Speaker 4>You ever see those?</v>

1916
01:26:15.231 --> 01:26:16.064
<v Speaker 4>You know how hard it is to fucking hang </v>
<v Speaker 4>from one arm and to hang from one arm </v>

1917
01:26:18.951 --> 01:26:21.560
<v Speaker 4>when you're 700 feet in the air or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something crazy.</v>

1918
01:26:21.590 --> 01:26:24.590
<v Speaker 4>It just makes you think how little human</v>
<v Speaker 4>life means in Russia.</v>

1919
01:26:24.890 --> 01:26:26.990
<v Speaker 4>Those dudes look,</v>

1929
01:26:51.951 --> 01:26:52.784
<v Speaker 4>number one guys.</v>

<v Speaker 4>ropes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1932
01:26:57.350 --> 01:27:00.560
<v Speaker 4>a climb.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes we'll map it out and sometimes</v>

1933
01:27:00.561 --> 01:27:03.920
<v Speaker 4>it was just a path that you can take and</v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes we'll map it out with ropes.</v>

1934
01:27:04.370 --> 01:27:05.330
<v Speaker 4>But he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1936
01:27:07.070 --> 01:27:08.420
<v Speaker 4>I don't really need the ropes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1937
01:27:08.421 --> 01:27:12.230
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck?</v>

<v Speaker 4>climbers.</v>

1939
01:27:15.611 --> 01:27:16.444
<v Speaker 4>And there waS a documentary they did </v>
<v Speaker 4>about them where this guy was like an </v>

<v Speaker 4>experienced climber.</v>

1942
01:27:21.980 --> 01:27:23.740
<v Speaker 4>it's a matter of when he's going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1943
01:27:24.350 --> 01:27:28.010

<v Speaker 4>too dangerous.</v>

1946
01:27:33.770 --> 01:27:35.960
<v Speaker 4>The breeze from the helicopter would be </v>
<v Speaker 4>super dangerous.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Eighteen miles.</v>

2007
01:30:01.330 --> 01:30:06.330
<v Speaker 3>Eighteen miles miles dab with no break.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All you can do is catch you catch a gust</v>

2008
01:30:07.751 --> 01:30:09.170
<v Speaker 3>of wind and your fucking toe.</v>

2009
01:30:09.750 --> 01:30:11.190
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:13.680
<v Speaker 4>Or you're toast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go full screen on this bitch.</v>

2011

<v Speaker 4>This is so insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look a fucking high.</v>

2012
01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:18.900
<v Speaker 4>He jumped out of a helicopter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that's a helicopter.</v>

2013
01:30:19.340 --> 01:30:21.660
<v Speaker 4>I think that's a plane now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't it?</v>

2014
01:30:21.930 --> 01:30:22.950

<v Speaker 4>That's a plane.</v>

2015
01:30:23.700 --> 01:30:26.280
<v Speaker 4>I think a helicopter be a harder thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>to jump out of.</v>

2016
01:30:26.281 --> 01:30:29.820
<v Speaker 4>I'm just guessing because the way the </v>
<v Speaker 4>wind is pressing downward.</v>

2017
01:30:30.300 --> 01:30:32.160
<v Speaker 4>Does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2018
01:30:32.220 --> 01:30:33.810

<v Speaker 4>He'll send me pictures of him jumping </v>

2023

2026
01:30:57.451 --> 01:30:58.284
<v Speaker 4>dropping our troops into the next step.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not too many people would be willing to </v>

<v Speaker 4>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2036
01:31:17.641 --> 01:31:18.474
<v Speaker 3>Then just don't tease me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jumping off the mountain is way crazier </v>

2037
01:31:21.361 --> 01:31:22.194
<v Speaker 3>when they're just skimming it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>jumping out of a plane where you know </v>

<v Speaker 4>This is the furthest distance ever </v>

2115
01:34:45.940 --> 01:34:48.450
<v Speaker 4>friend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you first started having sex,</v>

<v Speaker 2>What do you just.</v>

2123
01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:07.433
<v Speaker 2>No chicks out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no girls that come to baseball </v>

2124
01:35:09.261 --> 01:35:11.300
<v Speaker 2>games.</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I got off school,</v>

2125
01:35:11.330 --> 01:35:12.990
<v Speaker 2>I'll sit and you're dressed in fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>dea.</v>

2126
01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:15.350
<v Speaker 2>Jordache jeans and you're flaring </v>
<v Speaker 2>airbag.</v>

2127
01:35:15.620 --> 01:35:17.720
<v Speaker 2>What happened to baseball?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found pussy.</v>

2128
01:35:18.500 --> 01:35:21.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the first,</v>

2129
01:35:21.381 --> 01:35:22.880
<v Speaker 2>like slow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>steady,</v>

2130
01:35:22.881 --> 01:35:24.770
<v Speaker 2>like all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sex that I got,</v>

2131
01:35:24.771 --> 01:35:29.771
<v Speaker 2>I think it was either 16 or 17 and I had</v>
<v Speaker 2>a girlfriend who was a year younger than</v>

2132
01:35:29.931 --> 01:35:30.764
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know why I was nervous about it </v>

2133
01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:32.593
<v Speaker 2>because when I turned 18,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people were telling me that I could get </v>

2134
01:35:34.641 --> 01:35:37.100
<v Speaker 2>arrested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's right because she was oNly 17,</v>

2135
01:35:37.930 --> 01:35:39.980
<v Speaker 2>like you get arrested for statutory rape</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was like,</v>

2136
01:35:39.981 --> 01:35:41.960
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But a blank.</v>

2137
01:35:42.020 --> 01:35:45.170
<v Speaker 2>But we dated before when it was okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't matter.</v>

2138
01:35:45.170 --> 01:35:47.690
<v Speaker 2>You have to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my god.</v>

2139
01:35:47.700 --> 01:35:49.730
<v Speaker 2>I was terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought I was going to go to jail.</v>

2140
01:35:51.320 --> 01:35:52.730
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means you're 18.</v>

2141
01:35:52.731 --> 01:35:54.860
<v Speaker 2>You have to only bang someone your age </v>
<v Speaker 2>or older.</v>

2142
01:35:55.210 --> 01:35:56.690
<v Speaker 2>Who.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll take it a step further.</v>

2143
01:35:56.750 --> 01:35:57.583
<v Speaker 2>I've been talking about this in my act </v>
<v Speaker 2>of like how I still jerk off to like </v>

2144
01:36:00.891 --> 01:36:03.980
<v Speaker 2>I'll think about girls from high school </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I went to high school with and I'll</v>

2145
01:36:03.981 --> 01:36:05.420
<v Speaker 2>jerk off to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2146
01:36:05.510 --> 01:36:06.343
<v Speaker 2>And then uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got the yearbook and I looked up this </v>

2147
01:36:07.851 --> 01:36:08.720
<v Speaker 2>one girl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jill,</v>

2148
01:36:08.721 --> 01:36:09.554
<v Speaker 2>I won't say her last name and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>jerking off to her picture and then I </v>

2149
01:36:11.181 --> 01:36:12.260
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2150
01:36:12.261 --> 01:36:13.094
<v Speaker 2>I think this is wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then I thought no because I used to </v>

2151
01:36:14.961 --> 01:36:19.580
<v Speaker 2>jerk off to her before I was an adult,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so maybe I'm grandfathered in.</v>

2152
01:36:20.360 --> 01:36:21.193
<v Speaker 2>I would say you are.</v>

2153
01:36:21.230 --> 01:36:22.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm grandfathered in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2154
01:36:22.431 --> 01:36:23.264
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you start jerking off to one of your </v>

2155
01:36:24.051 --> 01:36:26.480
<v Speaker 2>kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>17 year old friends.</v>

2156
01:36:26.481 --> 01:36:28.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fucked up.</v>

2157
01:36:28.371 --> 01:36:30.110
<v Speaker 2>That's fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a felony.</v>

2158
01:36:30.450 --> 01:36:32.480
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you get pictures,</v>

2159
01:36:32.660 --> 01:36:33.493
<v Speaker 2>if I look at a yearbook to like say I </v>
<v Speaker 2>find it 2016 yearbook right from </v>

2160
01:36:38.481 --> 01:36:39.770
<v Speaker 2>hollywood high school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2161
01:36:40.160 --> 01:36:40.993
<v Speaker 2>I find it at a flea market and I take it</v>
<v Speaker 2>home and I'm jerking off to girls that </v>

2162
01:36:43.491 --> 01:36:44.780
<v Speaker 2>are 14,</v>
<v Speaker 2>15,</v>

2163
01:36:44.781 --> 01:36:46.850
<v Speaker 2>16 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that not kiddie porn?</v>

2164
01:36:46.970 --> 01:36:47.803
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's no pornography and so </v>

2165
01:36:49.100 --> 01:36:52.590
<v Speaker 2>100 percent up to your imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you seen a girl scene,</v>

2166
01:36:52.591 --> 01:36:54.250
<v Speaker 2>those varsity field hockey skirts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2167
01:36:54.450 --> 01:36:55.283
<v Speaker 2>I'm not into that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you see a girl walking down the </v>

2168
01:36:57.351 --> 01:36:58.184
<v Speaker 2>street and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think she's on the edge like 17 or </v>

2169
01:37:00.681 --> 01:37:02.030
<v Speaker 2>18 and you don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2170
01:37:02.031 --> 01:37:04.550
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to say she's 19 and she's</v>

2171
01:37:05.020 --> 01:37:05.853
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2172
01:37:06.140 --> 01:37:06.973
<v Speaker 2>I'm just guessing and then you go beat </v>
<v Speaker 2>off and are you any worse than if you </v>

2173
01:37:10.551 --> 01:37:11.630
<v Speaker 2>knew she was 17?</v>

2174
01:37:11.870 --> 01:37:12.703
<v Speaker 2>Have you see her?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's got a big fat ass and big juicy </v>

2175
01:37:15.171 --> 01:37:17.480
<v Speaker 2>young titties and she's walking on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>street like,</v>

2176
01:37:17.481 --> 01:37:19.160
<v Speaker 2>oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe she's only 17.</v>

2177
01:37:19.161 --> 01:37:21.410
<v Speaker 2>And then you go home and jerk off tour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's different,</v>

2178
01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:24.440
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Knowing knowing makes it creepy.</v>

2179
01:37:25.210 --> 01:37:26.110
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2180
01:37:26.120 --> 01:37:29.270
<v Speaker 2>Because you're jerking off to the age as</v>
<v Speaker 2>well as the image.</v>

2181
01:37:29.300 --> 01:37:31.910
<v Speaker 2>If you're going up to the image,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're fine.</v>

2182
01:37:31.970 --> 01:37:32.803
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you just see the girl walking down </v>

2183
01:37:33.471 --> 01:37:34.690
<v Speaker 2>the street and she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>god,</v>

2184
01:37:35.090 --> 01:37:36.040
<v Speaker 2>what do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Illegal.</v>

2185
01:37:36.320 --> 01:37:40.190
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you're gonna shoot a moose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to be 52 inches in Alaska,</v>

2186
01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:43.430
<v Speaker 2>which means,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means the,</v>

2187
01:37:43.431 --> 01:37:44.264
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the antlers have to have either a </v>

2188
01:37:45.681 --> 01:37:48.890
<v Speaker 2>certain amount of brow tines or they'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to be a certain distance apart from</v>

2189
01:37:48.891 --> 01:37:49.724
<v Speaker 2>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want the hunters only to hunt </v>

2190
01:37:52.100 --> 01:37:52.933
<v Speaker 2>mature animals that have already bred,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like just the idea of the conservation </v>

2191
01:37:55.921 --> 01:37:56.340
<v Speaker 2>aspect</v>

2192
01:37:56.340 --> 01:37:58.320
<v Speaker 1>of it to keep the breeding population </v>
<v Speaker 1>strong.</v>

2193
01:37:58.350 --> 01:38:00.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you're ready to shoot an animal,</v>

2194
01:38:00.901 --> 01:38:03.660
<v Speaker 1>especially if using a rifle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be really sure.</v>

2195
01:38:04.050 --> 01:38:04.883
<v Speaker 1>You have to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>

2196
01:38:04.890 --> 01:38:06.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know he's coming,</v>

2197
01:38:06.450 --> 01:38:07.350
<v Speaker 1>he's coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he's,</v>

2198
01:38:07.500 --> 01:38:09.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he's legal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's back up,</v>

2199
01:38:09.390 --> 01:38:10.980
<v Speaker 1>let's back up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it happens all the time.</v>

2200
01:38:10.981 --> 01:38:13.400
<v Speaker 1>Or guys like fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you know,</v>

2201
01:38:13.430 --> 01:38:14.263
<v Speaker 1>it turns out it was leak or if it wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>legal that's a good thing to shoot it </v>

2202
01:38:16.861 --> 01:38:20.280
<v Speaker 1>because even though it's an arbitrary </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing like decide or weird thing,</v>

2203
01:38:20.281 --> 01:38:21.114
<v Speaker 1>like trying to decipher whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 1>something is 50 plus inches from 200 </v>

2204
01:38:25.441 --> 01:38:27.150
<v Speaker 1>yards away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're just kind of guessing.</v>

2205
01:38:27.151 --> 01:38:28.050
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2206
01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:29.153
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a really important because if you </v>

2207
01:38:29.851 --> 01:38:33.230
<v Speaker 1>fuck up and you shoot one that's young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in deep shit it.</v>

2208
01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:33.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2209
01:38:33.960 --> 01:38:37.440
<v Speaker 1>So you could just make a mistake and </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot a bull that's 45 inches.</v>

2210
01:38:37.650 --> 01:38:39.510
<v Speaker 1>You're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'll lose your license.</v>

2211
01:38:39.511 --> 01:38:39.821
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2212
01:38:39.821 --> 01:38:41.430
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have to pay a fine.</v>

2213
01:38:41.460 --> 01:38:42.293
<v Speaker 1>You lose the animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You won't be able to take the animal </v>

2214
01:38:43.561 --> 01:38:45.000
<v Speaker 1>home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they check.</v>

2215
01:38:45.001 --> 01:38:45.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll check.</v>

2216
01:38:45.990 --> 01:38:46.823
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all the meat that you got from that </v>

2217
01:38:47.791 --> 01:38:51.270
<v Speaker 1>animal you fucked unless you poach it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless you decided to not tell anybody.</v>

2218
01:38:51.271 --> 01:38:53.280
<v Speaker 1>Which people do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they especially do.</v>

2219
01:38:53.281 --> 01:38:54.114
<v Speaker 1>If they realize they fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they fucked up on purpose or they got </v>

2220
01:38:56.461 --> 01:38:57.294
<v Speaker 1>delusion with themselves and they shoot </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's smaller than it should </v>

2221
01:38:59.221 --> 01:39:00.054
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're in big trouble though when </v>

2222
01:39:00.931 --> 01:39:02.340
<v Speaker 1>you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on the state.</v>

2223
01:39:02.730 --> 01:39:03.563
<v Speaker 1>Every state has different regulations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's kinda the same thing with </v>

2224
01:39:05.611 --> 01:39:08.550
<v Speaker 1>this 18 year old girl because like some </v>
<v Speaker 1>girls are 19.</v>

2225
01:39:08.551 --> 01:39:11.670
<v Speaker 1>They lived with their 15,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like some girls are in their 2015.</v>

2226
01:39:11.790 --> 01:39:13.680
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is weird when you see girls with porn</v>

2227
01:39:13.681 --> 01:39:14.514
<v Speaker 1>with pigtails and they pretend to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>just coming home from school and some </v>

2228
01:39:16.771 --> 01:39:20.460
<v Speaker 1>guy pulls their pants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his son and fucks him and comes in their</v>

2229
01:39:20.461 --> 01:39:22.190
<v Speaker 1>mouth and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what am I watching?</v>

2230
01:39:22.210 --> 01:39:24.550
<v Speaker 3>And they act like children act like </v>
<v Speaker 3>kids.</v>

2231
01:39:24.580 --> 01:39:26.220
<v Speaker 3>They act like young girls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2232
01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:28.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2233
01:39:28.571 --> 01:39:29.020
<v Speaker 3>but that's,</v>

2234
01:39:29.020 --> 01:39:31.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a woman playing a role.</v>

2235
01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:33.130
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's over 18,</v>

2236
01:39:33.160 --> 01:39:37.080
<v Speaker 1>she's a fully committed adult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a,</v>

2237
01:39:37.180 --> 01:39:40.170
<v Speaker 1>there's some girls that are like 14 and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

2238
01:39:40.180 --> 01:39:43.210
<v Speaker 1>they're 18 that especially when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>across the street,</v>

2239
01:39:43.540 --> 01:39:44.373
<v Speaker 1>you're not close to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't like catch subtle cues that </v>

2240
01:39:46.540 --> 01:39:48.190
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with a child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2241
01:39:48.340 --> 01:39:49.330
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like weird,</v>

2242
01:39:49.510 --> 01:39:53.650
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of girls in particular are </v>
<v Speaker 1>full grown by the time you're like 15,</v>

2243
01:39:54.040 --> 01:39:55.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there,</v>

2244
01:39:55.180 --> 01:39:56.380
<v Speaker 1>that's as tall as they're ever going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get.</v>

2245
01:39:56.770 --> 01:39:58.480
<v Speaker 1>Whereas boys keep growing a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>longer.</v>

2246
01:39:58.630 --> 01:39:59.920
<v Speaker 3>I grew in college.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2247
01:39:59.980 --> 01:40:02.980
<v Speaker 3>They say girls after they have their </v>
<v Speaker 3>periods stop growing or that makes sense</v>

2248
01:40:02.981 --> 01:40:03.970
<v Speaker 3>and stopping pleasant.</v>

2249
01:40:07.210 --> 01:40:09.360
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I,</v>

2250
01:40:09.450 --> 01:40:11.360
<v Speaker 3>if I'm at the beach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I,</v>

2251
01:40:11.560 --> 01:40:12.393
<v Speaker 3>if I'm at the beach and I see a girl and</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's with a girl that I can tell is </v>

2252
01:40:17.951 --> 01:40:21.250
<v Speaker 3>under 18,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she doesn't look under 18,</v>

2253
01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:22.833
<v Speaker 3>I won't look at her just out of fear </v>
<v Speaker 3>that she must be under 18 because you </v>

2254
01:40:26.651 --> 01:40:30.010
<v Speaker 3>don't want to put her in this bank bank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's got to stay out of the spank bank.</v>

2255
01:40:30.011 --> 01:40:30.844
<v Speaker 3>She's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2256
01:40:31.240 --> 01:40:32.820
<v Speaker 3>I put aI.</v>
<v Speaker 3>put a yellow tag on her.</v>

2257
01:40:32.840 --> 01:40:34.510
<v Speaker 3>Very ethical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2258
01:40:34.511 --> 01:40:36.820
<v Speaker 3>it's hard because once you have kids </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are teenagers,</v>

2259
01:40:36.821 --> 01:40:38.460
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking scary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2260
01:40:38.470 --> 01:40:41.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my fucking son is 16 years old,</v>

2261
01:40:42.550 --> 01:40:44.920
<v Speaker 3>but let's admit that that is a gray </v>
<v Speaker 3>area.</v>

2262
01:40:45.080 --> 01:40:47.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows?</v>

2263
01:40:47.990 --> 01:40:49.970
<v Speaker 1>That could be the older sister,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2264
01:40:49.971 --> 01:40:51.620
<v Speaker 1>it could be one girl and her older </v>
<v Speaker 1>sister,</v>

2265
01:40:51.650 --> 01:40:53.980
<v Speaker 1>like she might be 19 friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>might</v>

2266
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:56.350
<v Speaker 4>be 17.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She could be a 51 point buck.</v>

2267
01:40:56.770 --> 01:40:58.810
<v Speaker 4>She could be bull bull,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bull moose,</v>

2268
01:40:59.320 --> 01:41:01.000
<v Speaker 4>51 inch block.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus christ.</v>

2269
01:41:01.550 --> 01:41:02.383
<v Speaker 4>You've got to kill that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's the youngest girl you ever had </v>

2270
01:41:04.541 --> 01:41:09.541
<v Speaker 4>sex with when you were a teenager?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>

2271
01:41:10.990 --> 01:41:11.823
<v Speaker 4>I think I was 16.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My girlfriend was 15 and she was the </v>

2272
01:41:14.381 --> 01:41:17.080
<v Speaker 4>first girl I ever had sex with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that was the youngest.</v>

<v Speaker 4>As soon as it touched it,</v>

2276
01:41:27.240 --> 01:41:28.120
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

<v Speaker 4>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The first time I ever came was blow job.</v>

2278
01:41:32.350 --> 01:41:36.400
<v Speaker 4>I never beat off and there were serious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For real.</v>

2279
01:41:36.700 --> 01:41:37.533
<v Speaker 4>That must have been the greatest blue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jay paul ties dab and chasing that </v>

2280
01:41:39.701 --> 01:41:41.010

2281
01:41:41.080 --> 01:41:43.120
<v Speaker 4>My ears rang.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll never forget.</v>

2282
01:41:43.270 --> 01:41:44.103
<v Speaker 4>It was on the porch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the front porch of my girlfriend's </v>

2283
01:41:46.661 --> 01:41:48.280
<v Speaker 4>house.</v>

<v Speaker 1>universe and biology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's set up this crazy reward system to </v>

01:44:01.941 --> 01:44:02.774
<v Speaker 1>try to get you to breed.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you're at your least responsible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your least developed.</v>

<v Speaker 1>just ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>silly brain.</v>

2342
01:44:17.990 --> 01:44:18.823
<v Speaker 1>No way did I have any like sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility or how to take care of a </v>

<v Speaker 1>like the idea of the pill is a strange </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

2369
01:45:32.780 --> 01:45:35.360
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're circumventing biology.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You're saying that's not good for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature's I know what you're fucking plan</v>

2372
01:45:40.940 --> 01:45:41.773
<v Speaker 1>but guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's ready for this when you were </v>

2373
01:45:42.891 --> 01:45:44.000
<v Speaker 1>16.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2374
01:45:44.060 --> 01:45:47.060
<v Speaker 1>so we're going to give someone the pill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for girls it's a terrible deal.</v>

2375
01:45:47.230 --> 01:45:48.063
<v Speaker 1>They got to take these fucking wacky </v>
<v Speaker 1>hormones going to take estrogen when </v>

2376
01:45:50.661 --> 01:45:52.850
<v Speaker 1>you're 16.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what does that do to them?</v>

2377
01:45:52.880 --> 01:45:54.050
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2378
01:45:54.051 --> 01:45:55.400
<v Speaker 1>they say it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the big things,</v>

2379
01:45:55.940 --> 01:45:56.773
<v Speaker 1>it fucks up a woman's ability to </v>
<v Speaker 1>differentiate whether or not cheese </v>

2380
01:46:00.350 --> 01:46:02.540
<v Speaker 1>compatible with a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

2381
01:46:02.750 --> 01:46:03.583
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've done these things where they </v>

2382
01:46:04.701 --> 01:46:08.830
<v Speaker 1>take women and they'll have them smell a</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy's clothes,</v>

2383
01:46:08.850 --> 01:46:09.683
<v Speaker 1>clothes that a guy wore and they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>decide and they can just pick from the </v>

2384
01:46:13.761 --> 01:46:16.790
<v Speaker 1>smell whether or not they would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>compatible with that guy.</v>

2385
01:46:16.990 --> 01:46:17.823
<v Speaker 1>It turns out they're really good at </v>
<v Speaker 1>picking whether or not they're </v>

2386
01:46:19.221 --> 01:46:21.570
<v Speaker 1>genetically compatible with that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2387
01:46:21.740 --> 01:46:22.573
<v Speaker 1>But that gets totally monkey wrench into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gears as soon as they get on the </v>

2388
01:46:26.511 --> 01:46:27.344
<v Speaker 1>pill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they get on the pill that their </v>

2389
01:46:28.311 --> 01:46:30.470
<v Speaker 1>sense of smell doesn't work anymore like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2390
01:46:31.670 --> 01:46:32.503
<v Speaker 1>That sort of weird primate instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The animal instincts of being able to </v>

2391
01:46:37.911 --> 01:46:39.970
<v Speaker 1>smell whether or not the guys compatible</v>
<v Speaker 1>with you.</v>

2392
01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:41.600
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't work anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

2393
01:46:41.601 --> 01:46:46.601
<v Speaker 1>I knows rape this girl at the gym.</v>

<v Speaker 1>was next to me and she had long black </v>
<v Speaker 1>hair</v>

2395
01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:54.300
<v Speaker 3>and she tussled it up and put it into a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bun and whatever conditioner she had was</v>

2396
01:46:54.301 --> 01:46:56.190
<v Speaker 3>floating over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then she started running.</v>

2450
01:49:31.791 --> 01:49:35.970
<v Speaker 3>It was so off that a girl could pull off</v>
<v Speaker 3>to like both hippie species,</v>

2451
01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:36.833

<v Speaker 4>Warren pachulia.</v>

2462
01:49:58.660 --> 01:50:01.780
<v Speaker 4>Do you think some girl fucked him at one</v>
<v Speaker 4>point in his life because he was wearing</v>

2463
01:50:01.781 --> 01:50:02.720
<v Speaker 4>petrolia and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

2464
01:50:02.750 --> 01:50:05.050
<v Speaker 4>just roll the dice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If a really cancels out,</v>

2465
01:50:05.110 --> 01:50:05.943
<v Speaker 4>I don't want that kind of pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if a girl doesn't fuck me because </v>

2466
01:50:07.631 --> 01:50:08.464
<v Speaker 4>I'm wearing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but truly I don't want that kind of </v>

2467
01:50:08.951 --> 01:50:09.970
<v Speaker 4>pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>

2468
01:50:10.030 --> 01:50:10.900
<v Speaker 4>It's a lot of pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2469
01:50:10.910 --> 01:50:12.850
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's my argument for the fanny pack.</v>

2470
01:50:14.410 --> 01:50:15.243
<v Speaker 4>Well guys like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh jeez,</v>

2471
01:50:15.250 --> 01:50:16.420
<v Speaker 4>if you murdered,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2472
01:50:16.421 --> 01:50:18.980
<v Speaker 4>listen to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I wasn't married I'd be more inclined</v>

2473
01:50:19.050 --> 01:50:21.490
<v Speaker 4>to wear it because if a girl won't fuck </v>
<v Speaker 4>you because you wear a fanny pack,</v>

2474
01:50:21.491 --> 01:50:23.290
<v Speaker 4>you don't want her to fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's too much work.</v>

2475
01:50:23.410 --> 01:50:24.243
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2476
01:50:24.840 --> 01:50:26.940
<v Speaker 4>I love seeing single guys who have that </v>
<v Speaker 4>attitude.</v>

2477
01:50:26.941 --> 01:50:28.950
<v Speaker 4>That is the attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You kind of have that attitude.</v>

2478
01:50:28.951 --> 01:50:31.260
<v Speaker 4>Otherwise you get distracted and that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>what I learned from beating off.</v>

2479
01:50:31.630 --> 01:50:34.110
<v Speaker 4>It's one the things I learned from </v>
<v Speaker 4>beating off when I first started beating</v>

2480
01:50:34.111 --> 01:50:35.520
<v Speaker 4>off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I told you after I had sex.</v>

2481
01:50:35.540 --> 01:50:36.330
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I realized like,</v>

2482
01:50:36.330 --> 01:50:38.070
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is what's going on.</v>

2483
01:50:38.130 --> 01:50:41.070
<v Speaker 4>I got my little addict,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I came and I was like,</v>

2484
01:50:41.071 --> 01:50:44.070
<v Speaker 4>I don't really need to go out with her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think this is not necessary.</v>

2485
01:50:44.100 --> 01:50:46.490
<v Speaker 4>Like before I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to see here what am I going to see</v>

2486
01:50:46.491 --> 01:50:47.324
<v Speaker 4>her when I'm going to use here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I wOuld beat off and it would give </v>

2487
01:50:48.841 --> 01:50:51.960
<v Speaker 4>me a few hourS of relief and where I </v>
<v Speaker 4>could think clearly.</v>

2488
01:50:52.050 --> 01:50:52.880
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2489
01:50:52.880 --> 01:50:56.010
<v Speaker 4>Just have a bit way back iN the day </v>
<v Speaker 4>about jerk off first.</v>

2490
01:50:56.100 --> 01:50:56.933
<v Speaker 4>Then think about it that it should be </v>
<v Speaker 4>like an ethic that men approached their </v>

2491
01:50:58.921 --> 01:50:59.754
<v Speaker 4>entire life with some fucking terrible </v>
<v Speaker 4>mistakes you make when you're under the </v>

2492
01:51:02.731 --> 01:51:03.900
<v Speaker 4>influence of your own dick.</v>

2493
01:51:04.180 --> 01:51:06.900
<v Speaker 4>Because your own dick will talk in all </v>
<v Speaker 4>sorts of stupid situations.</v>

2494
01:51:06.901 --> 01:51:07.734
<v Speaker 4>But if you jerk off first,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know you're not goIng to go into a </v>

2495
01:51:09.931 --> 01:51:13.050
<v Speaker 4>barn at 4:00 in the morning with some </v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy girls doing coke.</v>

<v Speaker 4>hours and he knows a horrible one for me</v>

2519
01:52:16.451 --> 01:52:17.284
<v Speaker 4>in the summer when this would happen and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had jobs so it'd be like 4:30 in the </v>

2520
01:52:20.981 --> 01:52:24.280
<v Speaker 4>morning and I'd be still trying to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>laid and then I had to be up at seven to</v>

<v Speaker 4>thigh.</v>

2525
01:52:38.140 --> 01:52:40.840

<v Speaker 4>even got my clothes off.</v>

2526
01:52:41.020 --> 01:52:45.560
<v Speaker 4>I just hit the fucking bed sideways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Out cold.</v>

2527
01:52:45.620 --> 01:52:46.453
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wake up in the morning and do it all </v>

2528
01:52:46.971 --> 01:52:47.100
<v Speaker 4>over</v>

2529
01:52:47.100 --> 01:52:48.180
<v Speaker 5>again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh Yeah.</v>

2530
01:52:48.630 --> 01:52:49.463
<v Speaker 5>I used to park cars at a country club </v>
<v Speaker 5>and we would go out all we would get </v>

2531
01:52:53.161 --> 01:52:55.200
<v Speaker 5>paid in cash tips.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'd make a good one,</v>

2532
01:52:55.201 --> 01:52:57.540
<v Speaker 5>hundred and 50 bucks in cash.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was 16,</v>

2533
01:52:57.550 --> 01:52:59.880
<v Speaker 5>17 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 5>we go out to the bars,</v>

2534
01:52:59.881 --> 01:53:02.550
<v Speaker 5>do shots all night,</v>
<v Speaker 5>get laid.</v>

2535
01:53:02.551 --> 01:53:03.384
<v Speaker 5>We go skinny dipping.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was a pool that we'd break into </v>

2536
01:53:05.970 --> 01:53:06.803
<v Speaker 5>and it was a bunch of teenagers that </v>
<v Speaker 5>would all skinny dip on any given night </v>

2537
01:53:09.901 --> 01:53:10.734
<v Speaker 5>in the summer if it was hot out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you go to that pool that was naked </v>

2538
01:53:13.351 --> 01:53:14.184
<v Speaker 5>teenagers swimming and you could get </v>
<v Speaker 5>laid pretty easily and then we would go </v>

2539
01:53:19.591 --> 01:53:20.424
<v Speaker 5>and then we'd have to be there at 6:00 </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the morning to park cars because the </v>

2540
01:53:22.720 --> 01:53:23.553
<v Speaker 5>golfers and we get there and we had this</v>
<v Speaker 5>little wooden shack and we'd run up and </v>

2541
01:53:27.331 --> 01:53:29.490
<v Speaker 5>down the stairs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>parking these cars because it was down a</v>

2542
01:53:29.491 --> 01:53:31.230
<v Speaker 5>hill,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so you'd have to drive it down the hill,</v>

2543
01:53:31.440 --> 01:53:34.620
<v Speaker 5>run up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>drive it down the hill for hours,</v>

2544
01:53:34.740 --> 01:53:39.240
<v Speaker 5>and then finally they'd all be out on </v>
<v Speaker 5>the golf course kickback in that shack</v>

2545
01:53:39.360 --> 01:53:42.280
<v Speaker 4>and just fucking lay on the wooden floor</v>
<v Speaker 4>and sleep for a couple of hours.</v>

2546
01:53:44.380 --> 01:53:46.780
<v Speaker 4>Working when you're tired and your kid </v>
<v Speaker 4>is so important,</v>

2547
01:53:47.410 --> 01:53:50.320
<v Speaker 4>so important to realize how to power </v>
<v Speaker 4>through things.</v>

2548
01:53:50.680 --> 01:53:52.690
<v Speaker 4>You don't power through shit when you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>a little kid.</v>

2549
01:53:53.220 --> 01:53:56.440
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they make you take naps.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Quite the opposite of power and through.</v>

2550
01:53:56.560 --> 01:53:57.640
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like are you tired?</v>

2551
01:53:57.670 --> 01:53:58.270
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

2552
01:53:58.270 --> 01:53:59.103
<v Speaker 4>just take a nap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You need to take in that we don't want </v>

2553
01:54:00.100 --> 01:54:01.810
<v Speaker 4>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go take a nap.</v>

2554
01:54:02.090 --> 01:54:03.340
<v Speaker 4>Take a nap at school.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remember that?</v>

2555
01:54:03.400 --> 01:54:04.233
<v Speaker 4>These have nap time in school.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you'd take a nap when you got home </v>

2556
01:54:06.361 --> 01:54:09.140
<v Speaker 4>and then all of a sudden no more naps.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All of a sudden you have to work again.</v>

2557
01:54:09.160 --> 01:54:10.930
<v Speaker 4>It happens over the course of like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>couple of years.</v>

2558
01:54:10.960 --> 01:54:12.760
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now I got to get up at six.</v>

2559
01:54:13.570 --> 01:54:16.750
<v Speaker 4>Those summer jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those were the big eyeopener for me.</v>

2560
01:54:16.900 --> 01:54:17.733
<v Speaker 4>That's when I knew.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's when I fucking really knew I </v>

2561
01:54:20.321 --> 01:54:21.154
<v Speaker 4>could never work instruction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's when I really knew like summer </v>

2562
01:54:24.701 --> 01:54:27.320
<v Speaker 4>jobs when I was in high school and right</v>

2565
01:54:30.771 --> 01:54:33.260

<v Speaker 5>you should make your kid bust his ass in</v>

2566
01:54:33.261 --> 01:54:34.094
<v Speaker 5>high school so he can realize he needs </v>
<v Speaker 5>an education or you need to pick </v>

2567
01:54:36.721 --> 01:54:37.610
<v Speaker 5>something to do young.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I</v>

<v Speaker 4>Do different [inaudible].</v>

2569
01:54:39.041 --> 01:54:41.830
<v Speaker 4>I had other jobs that weren't as hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I worked at newport creamery.</v>

2570
01:54:42.130 --> 01:54:44.020
<v Speaker 4>I was a dishwasher and then I was a </v>
<v Speaker 4>cook.</v>

2571
01:54:44.590 --> 01:54:45.760
<v Speaker 4>Wasn't that hard?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2572
01:54:45.761 --> 01:54:47.410

2577

<v Speaker 4>though too much responsibility to be a </v>

<v Speaker 4>holy shit.</v>

2585
01:55:23.450 --> 01:55:24.283
<v Speaker 4>Like when you're a labor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're a 16 year old labor on a </v>

2586

01:55:34.160 --> 01:55:35.950
<v Speaker 4>And plus I didn't know how to hydrate </v>
<v Speaker 4>back down.</v>

2589
01:55:35.951 --> 01:55:39.880
<v Speaker 4>I never drank any water and drank a coke</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the morning and then all day,</v>

2590
01:55:39.881 --> 01:55:40.930
<v Speaker 4>no drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatnot.</v>

<v Speaker 1>day and be so tired.</v>

2595
01:55:50.920 --> 01:55:52.570
<v Speaker 1>But I remember thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2596
01:55:52.900 --> 01:55:54.670
<v Speaker 1>you got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's gotta be a fucking plan.</v>

2597
01:55:54.671 --> 01:55:55.504
<v Speaker 1>we got to make a plan to avoid this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can't be doing this because you guys </v>

2598
01:55:57.951 --> 01:56:00.850
<v Speaker 1>that would do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My friend leroy got me a job once.</v>

2599
01:56:01.090 --> 01:56:02.800
<v Speaker 1>This was a really important turning </v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

2600
01:56:02.801 --> 01:56:03.634
<v Speaker 1>He and his friend hank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would renovate buildings in </v>

2601
01:56:05.501 --> 01:56:08.110
<v Speaker 1>dorchester.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's real shit neighborhood real bad and</v>

2602
01:56:08.111 --> 01:56:08.944
<v Speaker 1>these buildings were like basically like</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely wrecked and they would redo </v>

2603
01:56:11.531 --> 01:56:13.030
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this one guy,</v>

2604
01:56:14.020 --> 01:56:14.853
<v Speaker 1>he was like semi homeless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He lived in this place while they were </v>

2605
01:56:19.181 --> 01:56:21.370
<v Speaker 1>redoing it and he had a mountain dew </v>
<v Speaker 1>jug,</v>

2606
01:56:21.371 --> 01:56:22.204
<v Speaker 1>like a two liter thing of mountain dew </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he filled with malt liquor and he </v>

2607
01:56:24.771 --> 01:56:28.180
<v Speaker 1>would just drink this mountain dew jug </v>
<v Speaker 1>of malt liquor all day.</v>

2608
01:56:28.181 --> 01:56:29.014
<v Speaker 1>He'd be just blasted all day on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>construction site and we're walking </v>

2609
01:56:32.261 --> 01:56:32.530
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

2610
01:56:32.530 --> 01:56:36.220
<v Speaker 1>IT's like exposed beams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a to the left and the right,</v>

2611
01:56:36.221 --> 01:56:38.490

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2612
01:56:38.491 --> 01:56:41.170
<v Speaker 1>that's an overlap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thus you could step through and you just</v>

2613
01:56:41.171 --> 01:56:42.004
<v Speaker 1>drop right through the floor below.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this fucking guy walked like a </v>

2614
01:56:44.321 --> 01:56:47.290
<v Speaker 1>ballerina drunk as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His name is jeff.</v>

2615

<v Speaker 1>Jeff walked around this,</v>

2616
01:56:49.641 --> 01:56:54.010
<v Speaker 1>this construction site and just barely </v>
<v Speaker 1>not stepping on nails,</v>

2617
01:56:54.280 --> 01:56:57.580
<v Speaker 1>just barely and drunk and hammered and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody knew it.</v>

2618
01:56:57.581 --> 01:57:01.540
<v Speaker 1>Shakes his hands would shake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just hold the mountain leader,</v>

2619
01:57:01.600 --> 01:57:02.433
<v Speaker 1>the two liter mountain dew thing and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking shake and while he's trying to </v>

2620
01:57:05.561 --> 01:57:09.370
<v Speaker 1>drink a full on alkie and you were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's my future.</v>

2621
01:57:10.030 --> 01:57:10.863
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think it was my future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I knew it could be a future if you </v>

2622
01:57:12.521 --> 01:57:14.470
<v Speaker 1>did what that guy's like,</v>

02:03:02.151 --> 02:03:02.984
<v Speaker 1>she's masturbating and looking at you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and like letting you know that she's </v>

2736
02:03:05.121 --> 02:03:07.940
<v Speaker 1>masturbating like whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's full surrender.</v>

2737
02:03:07.941 --> 02:03:08.774
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this girl that pushed off against </v>

2738
02:03:09.771 --> 02:03:10.670
<v Speaker 1>the wall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she got flea bites,</v>

2739
02:03:10.671 --> 02:03:14.150
<v Speaker 1>overlooked my fucking my carpet and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking fleas on it.</v>

2740
02:03:14.770 --> 02:03:15.890
<v Speaker 1>And she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

2741
02:03:15.891 --> 02:03:16.401
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah.</v>

2742
02:03:16.401 --> 02:03:21.050
<v Speaker 1>I gotta do something about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>some mattamy.</v>

2743
02:03:22.390 --> 02:03:25.700
<v Speaker 1>I used to have like little bites all </v>
<v Speaker 1>over my fucking ankles all the time.</v>

2744
02:03:25.780 --> 02:03:27.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just thing you had,</v>

2745
02:03:27.711 --> 02:03:31.640
<v Speaker 1>if you had a dog back then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we take some powder,</v>

2746
02:03:31.780 --> 02:03:32.613
<v Speaker 1>a spray or sprinkle some fucking powder </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then vacuum is supposed to kill the </v>

2747
02:03:36.561 --> 02:03:40.290
<v Speaker 1>fleas never killed most of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a few gangster fleas.</v>

2748
02:03:40.291 --> 02:03:42.410
<v Speaker 1>It would survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And your dog would always get them.</v>

2749
02:03:42.440 --> 02:03:43.760
<v Speaker 1>They go outside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just get fleas.</v>

2750
02:03:43.880 --> 02:03:47.500
<v Speaker 3>Did he have you had those bugs right now</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it was so rainy this winter.</v>

2751
02:03:47.501 --> 02:03:50.740
<v Speaker 3>We got these.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They look like giant mosquitoes,</v>

2752
02:03:50.741 --> 02:03:53.020
<v Speaker 3>but they're like five times as big as </v>
<v Speaker 3>mosquitoes.</v>

2753
02:03:53.440 --> 02:03:54.370
<v Speaker 3>Mosquito eaters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2754
02:03:54.371 --> 02:03:56.170
<v Speaker 3>They're all over the mosquito ears,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2755
02:03:56.620 --> 02:03:58.930
<v Speaker 3>They always seem to sting you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't seem to sting,</v>

2756
02:03:58.931 --> 02:04:00.610
<v Speaker 3>but you open your front door,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2757
02:04:00.611 --> 02:04:04.690
<v Speaker 3>They come right in there every night I </v>
<v Speaker 3>got to kill a couple of in the house.</v>

2758
02:04:05.280 --> 02:04:08.720
<v Speaker 3>Do they really eat mosquitoes?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how you would get days.</v>

2759
02:04:08.770 --> 02:04:09.603
<v Speaker 3>They're so slow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how they would get to a </v>

2760
02:04:11.561 --> 02:04:12.394
<v Speaker 3>mosquito.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe the mosquito would be stupid and </v>

2761
02:04:13.571 --> 02:04:14.300
<v Speaker 3>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dad,</v>

2762
02:04:14.300 --> 02:04:14.910
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2763
02:04:14.910 --> 02:04:17.200
<v Speaker 3>I can give you a hug.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2764
02:04:17.260 --> 02:04:19.630
<v Speaker 3>I mean I heard them called that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was thinking the same thing,</v>

2765
02:04:19.631 --> 02:04:21.340
<v Speaker 3>like how the fuck are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't.</v>

2766
02:04:21.341 --> 02:04:24.670
<v Speaker 3>Crane flies are actually physically </v>
<v Speaker 3>incapable of killing mosquitoes.</v>

2767
02:04:24.671 --> 02:04:25.930
<v Speaker 3>The main sustenance</v>

2768
02:04:26.200 --> 02:04:27.033
<v Speaker 1>of crane flies is flower nectar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The nickname mosquito eaters probably </v>

2769
02:04:30.321 --> 02:04:34.400
<v Speaker 1>comes to the fact that some larval cream</v>
<v Speaker 1>fleas feed on mosquito larva,</v>

2770
02:04:34.880 --> 02:04:37.560
<v Speaker 1>but it also is only occasionally</v>

2771
02:04:38.340 --> 02:04:40.770
<v Speaker 3>and those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's the size of Your hand.</v>

2772
02:04:40.830 --> 02:04:41.900
<v Speaker 3>They're big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2773
02:04:43.200 --> 02:04:45.510
<v Speaker 3>it's a weird bug.</v>
<v Speaker 3>YeAh,</v>

2774
02:04:45.511 --> 02:04:48.450
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and mosquitoes too.</v>

2775
02:04:48.451 --> 02:04:51.090
<v Speaker 3>There's a ton of mosquitoes right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got a wet winter.</v>

2776
02:04:51.630 --> 02:04:52.463
<v Speaker 3>It's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what's funny though is people </v>

2777
02:04:53.881 --> 02:04:56.430
<v Speaker 3>are so glass half empty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been here so many people go,</v>

2778
02:04:56.431 --> 02:04:57.264
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's going to be a real problem in </v>

2779
02:04:58.161 --> 02:05:00.990
<v Speaker 3>the summer when fire season starts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got all this bitch.</v>

2780
02:05:00.991 --> 02:05:04.380
<v Speaker 3>Can you just enjoy the green hills?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The hills are green.</v>

2781
02:05:04.490 --> 02:05:05.760
<v Speaker 3>It looks beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2782
02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:06.833
<v Speaker 3>I hope it keeps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope this place become seattle and </v>

2783
02:05:08.581 --> 02:05:11.250
<v Speaker 3>people move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope it rains constantly and they move</v>

2784
02:05:11.251 --> 02:05:14.220
<v Speaker 3>la to like the desert move into like </v>
<v Speaker 3>where area 51 is.</v>

2785
02:05:14.221 --> 02:05:15.360
<v Speaker 3>This is where we're going to film from </v>
<v Speaker 3>now on.</v>

2786
02:05:15.361 --> 02:05:17.700
<v Speaker 3>Guys start filming out there because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>never rains.</v>

2787
02:05:17.820 --> 02:05:18.653
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just read this book about the making </v>

2788
02:05:22.110 --> 02:05:25.710
<v Speaker 3>of the Panama canal and they talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2789
02:05:25.711 --> 02:05:27.840
<v Speaker 3>when the french,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the french first tried to do it.</v>

2790
02:05:27.840 --> 02:05:31.740
<v Speaker 3>They went in in the late 19th century </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they,</v>

2791
02:05:31.741 --> 02:05:32.574
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you gotta think technology in the late </v>

2792
02:05:33.811 --> 02:05:37.140
<v Speaker 3>19th century.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't have fucking electricity.</v>

2793
02:05:37.200 --> 02:05:38.033
<v Speaker 3>They didn't have shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had giant machines and they were </v>

2794
02:05:40.711 --> 02:05:41.544
<v Speaker 3>trying to bulldoze a canal through the </v>
<v Speaker 3>most dense tropical jungle that you </v>

2795
02:05:49.081 --> 02:05:50.640
<v Speaker 3>could get through and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they,</v>

2796
02:05:50.670 --> 02:05:54.840
<v Speaker 3>and they lost something like 20 percent </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the people that went down there,</v>

2797
02:05:55.020 --> 02:06:00.020
<v Speaker 3>died of malaria and yellow fever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which are both mosquito borne diseases.</v>

2798
02:06:00.540 --> 02:06:03.780
<v Speaker 3>So they go down there and they fight it </v>
<v Speaker 3>out for like 10 years.</v>

2799
02:06:03.781 --> 02:06:05.970
<v Speaker 3>They keep sending people down to keep </v>
<v Speaker 3>dying,</v>

2800
02:06:05.971 --> 02:06:08.810
<v Speaker 3>keep sending people down to keep dying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2801
02:06:08.850 --> 02:06:09.683
<v Speaker 3>and even if you don't die,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're working 14 hour days in jungle </v>

2802
02:06:13.681 --> 02:06:17.310
<v Speaker 3>heat with a fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with a little spade.</v>

2803
02:06:18.360 --> 02:06:19.193
<v Speaker 3>And then all of a sudden they'd get a </v>
<v Speaker 3>monster rain and everything you'd </v>

2804
02:06:22.321 --> 02:06:23.870
<v Speaker 3>excavated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there'd be a mudslide.</v>

2805
02:06:23.910 --> 02:06:26.910
<v Speaker 3>It would fill it right up again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'd start all over.</v>

2806
02:06:27.390 --> 02:06:28.223
<v Speaker 3>There were snakes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was fucking mountain lions and </v>

2807
02:06:31.801 --> 02:06:33.300
<v Speaker 3>they just finally gave up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Finally,</v>

2808
02:06:33.301 --> 02:06:35.520
<v Speaker 3>France just went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck this.</v>

2809
02:06:35.521 --> 02:06:38.250
<v Speaker 3>They had bled hundreds of millions of </v>
<v Speaker 3>dollars.</v>

2810
02:06:38.670 --> 02:06:40.480
<v Speaker 3>And so and so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then the us stepped in.</v>

2811
02:06:40.500 --> 02:06:41.970
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can do it.</v>

2812
02:06:42.930 --> 02:06:43.763
<v Speaker 3>So we came in and some guy had realized </v>
<v Speaker 3>that mosquitoes were the problem like </v>

2813
02:06:49.640 --> 02:06:50.520
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody knew that.</v>

2814
02:06:50.521 --> 02:06:51.354
<v Speaker 3>Malaria and yellow fever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're mosquito where mosquito born for </v>

2815
02:06:53.761 --> 02:06:56.160
<v Speaker 3>whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just thought it was fucking popping</v>

2816
02:06:56.161 --> 02:06:56.994
<v Speaker 3>out out of the dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They thought it was like fumes coming </v>

2817
02:06:58.711 --> 02:07:00.300
<v Speaker 3>out of the dirt and this guy's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2818
02:07:00.301 --> 02:07:01.134
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking mosquitoes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he came in with a team of like 10 </v>

2819
02:07:05.671 --> 02:07:09.600
<v Speaker 3>people and they just started in </v>
<v Speaker 3>educating people about how to get rid of</v>

2820
02:07:09.601 --> 02:07:10.434
<v Speaker 3>mosquitoes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is basically get rid of standing </v>

2821
02:07:12.361 --> 02:07:15.060
<v Speaker 3>water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so instead of having mud roads,</v>

2822
02:07:15.270 --> 02:07:16.103
<v Speaker 3>they poured concrete and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and instead of having open barrels that </v>

2823
02:07:19.531 --> 02:07:24.531
<v Speaker 3>people will collect rainwater and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>would put sheets over them and a fucking</v>

2824
02:07:25.111 --> 02:07:26.190
<v Speaker 3>god.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

2825
02:07:26.370 --> 02:07:31.370
<v Speaker 3>That's all he had to do to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No deaths from malaria and yellow fever.</v>

2826
02:07:31.770 --> 02:07:33.960
<v Speaker 3>After the first couple of years they </v>
<v Speaker 3>started construction.</v>

2827
02:07:34.020 --> 02:07:35.010
<v Speaker 3>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2828
02:07:35.170 --> 02:07:35.980
<v Speaker 3>They just figured out a</v>

2829
02:07:35.980 --> 02:07:38.740
<v Speaker 4>way to stop the mosquitoes from breeding</v>
<v Speaker 4>without poison,</v>

2830
02:07:39.640 --> 02:07:41.470
<v Speaker 4>without poison.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's incredible.</v>

2831
02:07:41.700 --> 02:07:44.770
<v Speaker 4>I would have thought they would just </v>
<v Speaker 4>agent orange the fuck out of that place.</v>

2832
02:07:45.340 --> 02:07:47.230
<v Speaker 4>Just standing water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2833
02:07:47.620 --> 02:07:49.960
<v Speaker 4>Do you know malaria has killed half the </v>
<v Speaker 4>people that have ever died ever?</v>

2834
02:07:50.620 --> 02:07:54.100
<v Speaker 4>No shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2835
02:07:54.850 --> 02:07:57.340
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Half the people that have ever done ever</v>

2836
02:07:57.400 --> 02:08:01.180
<v Speaker 4>in the history of the human race of </v>
<v Speaker 4>dying from malaria and still unabated,</v>

2837
02:08:01.181 --> 02:08:02.710
<v Speaker 4>no fucking cure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My friend.</v>

2838
02:08:02.711 --> 02:08:04.630
<v Speaker 4>Justin's got it at three times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

2839
02:08:04.840 --> 02:08:05.770
<v Speaker 4>Where's he live?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2840
02:08:05.771 --> 02:08:08.170
<v Speaker 4>he goes to the Congo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>makes wells for the pygmies,</v>

2841
02:08:09.940 --> 02:08:10.773
<v Speaker 4>justin wren.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you catch it and you take the </v>

2842
02:08:13.091 --> 02:08:14.290
<v Speaker 4>pill right away,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're fine.</v>

2843
02:08:14.740 --> 02:08:18.160
<v Speaker 4>If you get the proper medication,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you will be okay.</v>

2844
02:08:18.220 --> 02:08:19.053
<v Speaker 4>But there's a bunch of different strains</v>
<v Speaker 4>of malaria and some of them last a long </v>

2845
02:08:22.361 --> 02:08:25.300
<v Speaker 4>time and he's had one strain where he </v>
<v Speaker 4>got it.</v>

2846
02:08:25.300 --> 02:08:28.690
<v Speaker 4>He recovered from It and then he got </v>
<v Speaker 4>sick and because he got sick,</v>

2847
02:08:28.691 --> 02:08:29.524
<v Speaker 4>the malaria came back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he got an unrelated illness without </v>

2848
02:08:32.261 --> 02:08:33.094
<v Speaker 4>being around the mosquitoes and malaria </v>
<v Speaker 4>came back and he had to figure it out </v>

2849
02:08:35.710 --> 02:08:38.380
<v Speaker 4>that the malaria had made a relapse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he's had it three times,</v>

2850
02:08:38.381 --> 02:08:40.900
<v Speaker 4>two times from being bitten one time </v>
<v Speaker 4>from a relapse.</v>

2851
02:08:41.290 --> 02:08:44.180
<v Speaker 4>So is malaria something that just stays </v>
<v Speaker 4>with you for life?</v>

2852
02:08:44.181 --> 02:08:46.210
<v Speaker 4>I think with some cases,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and not just.</v>

2853
02:08:46.240 --> 02:08:47.073
<v Speaker 4>Not necessarily for live,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it can recur over the course of a </v>

2854
02:08:49.781 --> 02:08:50.614
<v Speaker 4>certain amount of years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then your body eventually gets over </v>

2855
02:08:52.331 --> 02:08:53.164
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he was saying that one case of </v>

2856
02:08:54.161 --> 02:08:57.190
<v Speaker 4>malaria,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can have it for as much as 30 years.</v>

2857
02:08:57.610 --> 02:08:58.443
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And dying of it is about as painful as </v>

2858
02:09:01.361 --> 02:09:04.390
<v Speaker 3>it gets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your brain starts to fucking fry.</v>

2859
02:09:04.391 --> 02:09:08.020
<v Speaker 3>You just go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your entire body feels like it's made of</v>

2860
02:09:08.021 --> 02:09:09.340
<v Speaker 3>acid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's brutal.</v>

2861
02:09:10.150 --> 02:09:12.070
<v Speaker 3>Fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

2862
02:09:12.310 --> 02:09:14.080
<v Speaker 3>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you think about how,</v>

2863
02:09:14.140 --> 02:09:15.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>third world,</v>

2864
02:09:15.820 --> 02:09:18.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're trying to do good in the world.</v>

2865
02:09:18.581 --> 02:09:22.600
<v Speaker 3>Malaria is just number one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two and three that we should be focusing</v>

2866
02:09:22.601 --> 02:09:23.010
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

2867
02:09:23.010 --> 02:09:23.843
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was some work that they were </v>

2868
02:09:24.871 --> 02:09:26.490
<v Speaker 4>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2869
02:09:26.560 --> 02:09:28.320
<v Speaker 4>kind of want to say somewhere around </v>
<v Speaker 4>California,</v>

2870
02:09:28.321 --> 02:09:33.180
<v Speaker 4>someone was doing it where they were </v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to figure out a way to engineer a</v>

2871
02:09:33.181 --> 02:09:34.014
<v Speaker 4>mosquito that does not get malaria.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they were going to release that </v>

2872
02:09:37.621 --> 02:09:38.890
<v Speaker 4>mosquito.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

2873
02:09:38.891 --> 02:09:39.940
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I heard about this.</v>

2874
02:09:40.340 --> 02:09:41.400
<v Speaker 4>Is that what it was?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2875
02:09:41.401 --> 02:09:46.140
<v Speaker 4>I think it happened with zika virus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Malaria really kill half the people that</v>

2876
02:09:46.141 --> 02:09:48.300
<v Speaker 4>ever lived get the facts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did it?</v>

2877
02:09:50.100 --> 02:09:50.910
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter.</v>

2878
02:09:50.910 --> 02:09:53.760
<v Speaker 3>It's definitely probably one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>biggest throughout human history.</v>

2879
02:09:53.761 --> 02:09:57.750
<v Speaker 3>But to actually know the actual fact if </v>
<v Speaker 3>it has killed that many people,</v>

2880
02:09:58.020 --> 02:10:00.490
<v Speaker 3>it's probably not because it would have </v>
<v Speaker 3>had to kill it at an average of five and</v>

2881
02:10:00.491 --> 02:10:04.320
<v Speaker 3>a half million per year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And for like the last 30 or 40 years,</v>

2882
02:10:04.321 --> 02:10:06.570
<v Speaker 3>it's only about two to $3 million.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that number,</v>

2883
02:10:07.560 --> 02:10:09.750
<v Speaker 3>30 or 40 years?</v>
<v Speaker 3>At least 20 percent.</v>

2884
02:10:09.900 --> 02:10:10.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2885
02:10:10.580 --> 02:10:11.420
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they don't know.</v>

2886
02:10:11.450 --> 02:10:12.770
<v Speaker 4>So where does it come from?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does any.</v>

2887
02:10:12.810 --> 02:10:15.380
<v Speaker 4>There's any site support that this site </v>
<v Speaker 4>tries to debunk it.</v>

2888
02:10:15.381 --> 02:10:17.540
<v Speaker 4>We have to be sure that they're not </v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

2889
02:10:17.541 --> 02:10:20.780
<v Speaker 4>Because I feel like I read it from a </v>
<v Speaker 4>science paper,</v>

2890
02:10:21.350 --> 02:10:22.760
<v Speaker 4>which might not necessarily look.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

2891
02:10:22.761 --> 02:10:25.400
<v Speaker 4>we had rob wolf the other day and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>thought that the vomitorium was really.</v>

2892
02:10:25.401 --> 02:10:29.770
<v Speaker 4>Some people make mistakes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's a,</v>

2893
02:10:29.780 --> 02:10:30.613
<v Speaker 4>it's killed fuck loads of people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just there's a lot of those god </v>

2894
02:10:33.180 --> 02:10:34.610
<v Speaker 4>disease.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It scared the shit out of you.</v>

2895
02:10:34.611 --> 02:10:35.444
<v Speaker 4>Like remember when the ebola crisis </v>
<v Speaker 4>happened and everybody was panicking </v>

2896
02:10:37.761 --> 02:10:39.680
<v Speaker 4>that a bullet made its way to the United</v>
<v Speaker 4>States.</v>

2897
02:10:39.950 --> 02:10:41.540
<v Speaker 4>Remember that one lady,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she was a nurse.</v>

2898
02:10:41.830 --> 02:10:44.930
<v Speaker 4>She was in quarantine and they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they tried to keep from quarantine.</v>

2899
02:10:44.940 --> 02:10:45.561
<v Speaker 4>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck you.</v>

2900
02:10:45.561 --> 02:10:47.300
<v Speaker 4>I'm going shopping.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

2901
02:10:47.770 --> 02:10:48.850
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like,</v>

2902
02:10:48.880 --> 02:10:49.710
<v Speaker 4>bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're quarantined.</v>

2903
02:10:49.710 --> 02:10:50.543
<v Speaker 4>I don't Have it.</v>

2904
02:10:50.620 --> 02:10:51.453
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this zika thing is not under under </v>

2905
02:10:52.611 --> 02:10:53.870
<v Speaker 4>wraps.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've got it here.</v>

2906
02:10:53.871 --> 02:10:55.530
<v Speaker 4>It's down in floridA.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

2907
02:10:55.550 --> 02:10:56.383
<v Speaker 4>I think that they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know they were trying to genetically </v>

2908
02:10:58.310 --> 02:11:01.220
<v Speaker 4>modify mosquitoes for zika.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2909
02:11:01.580 --> 02:11:03.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a friend of mine.</v>

2910
02:11:03.680 --> 02:11:05.150
<v Speaker 4>His wife got pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wouldn't,</v>

2911
02:11:05.180 --> 02:11:08.900
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't let her go anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>so like we were supposed to go to Hawaii</v>

2912
02:11:08.901 --> 02:11:10.810
<v Speaker 4>or maybe Mexico or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they were like,</v>

2913
02:11:10.820 --> 02:11:12.000
<v Speaker 4>fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2914
02:11:12.050 --> 02:11:12.883
<v Speaker 4>We're not taking any chances.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna stay right here while this </v>

2915
02:11:14.061 --> 02:11:15.320
<v Speaker 4>kid's born.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck yeah.</v>

2916
02:11:15.380 --> 02:11:16.213
<v Speaker 4>Because it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's incurable and your kid develops a </v>

2917
02:11:18.711 --> 02:11:19.544
<v Speaker 4>tiny head and it's a really creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't even know what else happens </v>

2918
02:11:22.521 --> 02:11:23.510
<v Speaker 4>because they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2919
02:11:23.511 --> 02:11:26.420
<v Speaker 4>the kids that are born from it are only </v>
<v Speaker 4>a few years old at this point.</v>

2920
02:11:26.450 --> 02:11:29.390
<v Speaker 4>Fucking crazy disease.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's so cruel.</v>

2921
02:11:29.630 --> 02:11:32.990
<v Speaker 4>So horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a guy named Peter Cortez that I,</v>

2922
02:11:32.991 --> 02:11:33.824
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>interviewed once and he was talking to </v>

2923
02:11:35.301 --> 02:11:36.430
<v Speaker 4>me about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2924
02:11:36.620 --> 02:11:38.990
<v Speaker 4>it was for my saifai,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sheila did years back and he was talking</v>

2925
02:11:38.991 --> 02:11:39.850
<v Speaker 4>to me about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2926
02:11:39.950 --> 02:11:42.380
<v Speaker 4>jungle diseases like people that have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2927
02:11:43.100 --> 02:11:43.933
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>any sort of infestations of parasites </v>

2928
02:11:46.671 --> 02:11:47.630
<v Speaker 4>and things like that in the jungle.</v>

2929
02:11:47.960 --> 02:11:51.020
<v Speaker 4>And he said it is 100 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>people that lived there.</v>

2930
02:11:52.010 --> 02:11:54.950
<v Speaker 4>They have the 100 percent of the people </v>
<v Speaker 4>that live there have something.</v>

2931
02:11:55.100 --> 02:11:56.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One hundred percent.</v>

2932
02:11:56.261 --> 02:11:58.760
<v Speaker 4>I went 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does that mean they're living with it or</v>

2933
02:11:58.761 --> 02:12:00.410
<v Speaker 4>they're suffering from it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're living with it.</v>

2934
02:12:00.830 --> 02:12:02.000
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they might be suffering from it,</v>

2935
02:12:02.510 --> 02:12:04.280
<v Speaker 4>but one of them was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2936
02:12:04.370 --> 02:12:08.630
<v Speaker 4>this cat parasite toxoplasma.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever heard of that?</v>

2937
02:12:08.631 --> 02:12:09.590
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm pregnant.</v>

2938
02:12:09.591 --> 02:12:12.050
<v Speaker 4>Women are super dangerous for women to </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2939
02:12:12.051 --> 02:12:12.884
<v Speaker 4>handle cat shit because of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You shouldn't touch a litter box or eat </v>

2940
02:12:15.261 --> 02:12:17.320
<v Speaker 4>any vegetables in France because they </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't.</v>

2941
02:12:17.540 --> 02:12:18.700
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my friend,</v>

2942
02:12:18.710 --> 02:12:21.380
<v Speaker 4>my wife went to France when she was </v>
<v Speaker 4>pregnant and they said that she couldn't</v>

2943
02:12:21.381 --> 02:12:24.320
<v Speaker 4>eat cheese because they don't pass her </v>
<v Speaker 4>eyes it out correctly.</v>

2944
02:12:24.321 --> 02:12:25.600
<v Speaker 4>And France.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2945
02:12:25.610 --> 02:12:26.443
<v Speaker 4>it makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They like that raw stinky cheese down </v>

2946
02:12:28.251 --> 02:12:29.390
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They love that stuff,</v>

2947
02:12:29.420 --> 02:12:30.980
<v Speaker 4>they love it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it,</v>

2948
02:12:30.981 --> 02:12:31.814
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a weird one because it makes the </v>

2949
02:12:33.950 --> 02:12:34.783
<v Speaker 4>rat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when a rat eats it or rat gets it into </v>

2950
02:12:37.471 --> 02:12:38.304
<v Speaker 4>its body,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a rap become sexually attracted to the </v>

2951
02:12:39.921 --> 02:12:40.754
<v Speaker 4>smell cat urine to the point where their</v>
<v Speaker 4>dick gets hard and their ball swell up </v>

2952
02:12:44.450 --> 02:12:46.940
<v Speaker 4>and they go find the cat and the cat </v>
<v Speaker 4>kills him.</v>

2953
02:12:47.150 --> 02:12:47.983
<v Speaker 4>And then the cat relays it to people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things it does with </v>

2954
02:12:51.141 --> 02:12:52.790
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it makes him reckless.</v>

2955
02:12:53.180 --> 02:12:54.013
<v Speaker 4>So there's a direct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a guy named Dr. Roberts polsky </v>

2956
02:12:56.180 --> 02:12:56.360
<v Speaker 4>at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2957
02:12:56.360 --> 02:13:00.710
<v Speaker 4>stanford who's done extensive research </v>
<v Speaker 4>on toxoplasma is fucking fascinating.</v>

2958
02:13:00.711 --> 02:13:03.860
<v Speaker 4>Guys get some awesome speeches where he </v>
<v Speaker 4>talks about it online,</v>

2959
02:13:04.160 --> 02:13:04.993
<v Speaker 4>but one of the things they found when he</v>
<v Speaker 4>was working in the er is a direct </v>

2960
02:13:07.131 --> 02:13:10.880
<v Speaker 4>correlation between toxo plasma and </v>
<v Speaker 4>motorcycle accidents.</v>

2961
02:13:11.570 --> 02:13:14.930
<v Speaker 4>Like a lot of these people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're really people that would come in</v>

2962
02:13:14.931 --> 02:13:16.640
<v Speaker 4>and they would have motorcycle </v>
<v Speaker 4>accidents.</v>

2963
02:13:16.641 --> 02:13:19.820
<v Speaker 4>They would test them and they would find</v>
<v Speaker 4>out they tested positive for toxo.</v>

2964
02:13:20.390 --> 02:13:21.223
<v Speaker 4>$50.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Million people in America tested </v>

2965
02:13:23.241 --> 02:13:26.290
<v Speaker 4>positive for toxo plasma brielle yep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it,</v>

2966
02:13:26.291 --> 02:13:27.124
<v Speaker 4>it affects the way you think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it affects your judgment and makes you </v>

2967
02:13:29.961 --> 02:13:32.220
<v Speaker 4>more impulsive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>makes you more aggressive.</v>

2968
02:13:32.520 --> 02:13:34.050
<v Speaker 4>And it might even affect women.</v>

2969
02:13:34.050 --> 02:13:37.910
<v Speaker 4>It might make women more promiscuous or </v>
<v Speaker 4>at least make them more um,</v>

2970
02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.110
<v Speaker 4>sexually submissive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't know.</v>

2971
02:13:40.140 --> 02:13:40.973
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is just a complete total </v>

2972
02:13:41.911 --> 02:13:42.744
<v Speaker 4>speculation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they think it might be one of the </v>

2973
02:13:43.921 --> 02:13:44.754
<v Speaker 4>reasons why some south american </v>
<v Speaker 4>countries are very macho and the women </v>

2974
02:13:47.641 --> 02:13:49.830
<v Speaker 4>are like very sexy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So why did we win with cats?</v>

2975
02:13:49.831 --> 02:13:51.780
<v Speaker 4>Always live alone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's the same,</v>

2976
02:13:52.400 --> 02:13:54.090
<v Speaker 4>but those cats never leave the house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

2977
02:13:54.120 --> 02:13:56.840
<v Speaker 4>So if you don't have a cat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't catch this.</v>

2978
02:13:56.970 --> 02:13:57.810
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can catch it.</v>

2979
02:13:57.840 --> 02:13:58.673
<v Speaker 4>You can catch it from the meat of a cow </v>
<v Speaker 4>that eats the cat shit and it's in its </v>

2980
02:14:03.240 --> 02:14:05.040
<v Speaker 4>grass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there's a bunch of different ways.</v>

2981
02:14:05.041 --> 02:14:05.874
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people currently,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's probably 50 Million people in </v>

2982
02:14:07.501 --> 02:14:09.690
<v Speaker 4>the country that have this currently in </v>
<v Speaker 4>America.</v>

2983
02:14:09.691 --> 02:14:10.524
<v Speaker 4>There's 50 million people plus that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>infected with this parasite called </v>

2984
02:14:14.970 --> 02:14:17.330
<v Speaker 4>toxoplasmosis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Should you geT tested for it then?</v>

2985
02:14:17.360 --> 02:14:18.690
<v Speaker 4>I probably have it for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm scared.</v>

2986
02:14:18.691 --> 02:14:20.610
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to get tested because you </v>
<v Speaker 4>have cats,</v>

2987
02:14:20.611 --> 02:14:21.444
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2988
02:14:21.480 --> 02:14:22.460
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm definitely.</v>

2989
02:14:22.640 --> 02:14:26.910
<v Speaker 4>I'm joey diaz has 150,000 fucking cats.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's for sure.</v>

2990
02:14:26.911 --> 02:14:29.090
<v Speaker 4>Got it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All those crazy cat ladies are guarantee</v>

2991
02:14:29.091 --> 02:14:29.930
<v Speaker 4>you they have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2992
02:14:30.360 --> 02:14:32.700
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a really common thing.</v>

2993
02:14:32.730 --> 02:14:33.563
<v Speaker 4>I think in France at one point there was</v>
<v Speaker 4>something like 30 percent of the </v>

2994
02:14:35.761 --> 02:14:37.120
<v Speaker 4>population had talked,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so.</v>

2995
02:14:37.170 --> 02:14:38.160
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2996
02:14:39.840 --> 02:14:40.650
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's real.</v>

2997
02:14:40.650 --> 02:14:42.360
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have feral cats.</v>

2998
02:14:42.390 --> 02:14:45.180
<v Speaker 4>Is that a bacteria then?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a parasite.</v>

2999
02:14:45.540 --> 02:14:46.373
<v Speaker 4>It's so sort of a parasite that actually</v>
<v Speaker 4>gets its way into your brain because </v>

3000
02:14:49.051 --> 02:14:49.884
<v Speaker 4>that's the crazy thing is what I forget </v>
<v Speaker 4>what percentage of your body weight is </v>

3001
02:14:53.011 --> 02:14:55.760
<v Speaker 4>bacteria,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's staggering nuts.</v>

3002
02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.410
<v Speaker 4>Charge 15 percent of your body weight is</v>
<v Speaker 4>bacteria.</v>

3003
02:14:58.530 --> 02:14:59.171
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're.</v>

3004
02:14:59.171 --> 02:15:01.370
<v Speaker 4>We're all you need to the steps.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See how full of shit.</v>

3005
02:15:01.371 --> 02:15:02.100
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

3006
02:15:02.100 --> 02:15:02.933
<v Speaker 4>find out how many people in America have</v>
<v Speaker 4>toxoplasma before we find that </v>

3007
02:15:04.771 --> 02:15:05.690
<v Speaker 4>approximately $30.</v>

3008
02:15:05.690 --> 02:15:06.630
<v Speaker 4>Million.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thirty dollars million.</v>

3009
02:15:06.840 --> 02:15:08.820
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It says it's the number.</v>

3010
02:15:09.690 --> 02:15:11.510
<v Speaker 4>See bright $50 million.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See if I.</v>

3011
02:15:11.550 --> 02:15:14.730
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember that wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3012
02:15:14.760 --> 02:15:17.400
<v Speaker 4>50 million people in America have talks </v>
<v Speaker 4>with one of them died.</v>

3013
02:15:17.790 --> 02:15:18.623
<v Speaker 4>Oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it kills you on a </v>

3014
02:15:19.621 --> 02:15:21.570
<v Speaker 4>motorcycle wreck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Motorcycles.</v>

3015
02:15:22.070 --> 02:15:23.820
<v Speaker 4>But [inaudible] was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3016
02:15:24.300 --> 02:15:25.140
<v Speaker 4>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3017
02:15:25.170 --> 02:15:26.003
<v Speaker 4>studying it's effects on people and </v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to figure out like they don't </v>

3018
02:15:29.251 --> 02:15:30.084
<v Speaker 4>really know what it does to people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's just this correlation between </v>

3019
02:15:31.891 --> 02:15:35.070
<v Speaker 4>motorcycle accident.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Another thing that says up to 60 million</v>

3020
02:15:35.071 --> 02:15:39.510
<v Speaker 4>people could have it so makes that a </v>
<v Speaker 4>million people just in America,</v>

3021
02:15:39.710 --> 02:15:41.310
<v Speaker 4>just in America,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in other countries,</v>

3022
02:15:41.311 --> 02:15:43.350
<v Speaker 4>like in some south american countries,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very high.</v>

3023
02:15:43.950 --> 02:15:44.820
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3024
02:15:44.821 --> 02:15:46.920
<v Speaker 4>it might've been just something that </v>
<v Speaker 4>people been living with forever.</v>

3025
02:15:47.030 --> 02:15:47.863
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's some sort of a weird connection </v>

3026
02:15:49.891 --> 02:15:50.724
<v Speaker 4>that we have to these organisms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in this one it rewires the sexual </v>

3027
02:15:54.961 --> 02:15:58.600
<v Speaker 4>reward system of rodin's changes the </v>
<v Speaker 4>reward system.</v>

3028
02:15:58.601 --> 02:16:02.120
<v Speaker 4>It makes their dick hard for cat piss so</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they go near the cat.</v>

3029
02:16:02.121 --> 02:16:02.954
<v Speaker 4>So they get killed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they can transmit it to people </v>

3030
02:16:04.021 --> 02:16:05.770
<v Speaker 4>because cats hanging around with people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3031
02:16:05.771 --> 02:16:08.370
<v Speaker 4>assuming that that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the chain of events.</v>

3032
02:16:08.430 --> 02:16:09.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking a man.</v>

3033
02:16:10.050 --> 02:16:13.560
<v Speaker 4>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at that one to three percent of the</v>

3034
02:16:13.561 --> 02:16:16.890
<v Speaker 4>body's mass in a 200 pound adults is two</v>
<v Speaker 4>to six pounds of bacteria,</v>

3035
02:16:16.920 --> 02:16:19.110
<v Speaker 4>but also play a vital role in human </v>
<v Speaker 4>health.</v>

3036
02:16:19.680 --> 02:16:20.513
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Human body contains trillions of </v>

3037
02:16:23.101 --> 02:16:26.820
<v Speaker 4>microorganisms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Outnumbering human cells by 10 to one,</v>

3038
02:16:32.740 --> 02:16:33.573
<v Speaker 4>so three percent of the body's mass,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they outnumber human cells just </v>

3039
02:16:37.001 --> 02:16:39.250
<v Speaker 4>because of the size,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they're small size.</v>

3040
02:16:39.251 --> 02:16:40.084
<v Speaker 4>However,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the micro organisms make up only one to </v>

3041
02:16:41.171 --> 02:16:44.770
<v Speaker 4>three percent of the body's mass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't make as much of the mass,</v>

3042
02:16:44.771 --> 02:16:49.720
<v Speaker 4>but you are outnumbered.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Human cells are outnumbered 10 to one.</v>

3043
02:16:49.830 --> 02:16:50.663
<v Speaker 4>That's like if there's every one rap for</v>
<v Speaker 4>every person on a ship and there's 10 </v>

3044
02:16:55.061 --> 02:16:57.730
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>think of that.</v>

3045
02:16:58.890 --> 02:16:59.723
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a fucking infested rat filled </v>

3046
02:17:01.301 --> 02:17:03.610
<v Speaker 4>ship.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some of the bacteria is good.</v>

3047
02:17:03.820 --> 02:17:05.000
<v Speaker 4>Some of it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3048
02:17:05.001 --> 02:17:07.140
<v Speaker 4>but I'm just saying you're mostly rats.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He feels like.</v>

3049
02:17:07.150 --> 02:17:08.710
<v Speaker 4>What does that a ship of people?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3050
02:17:08.711 --> 02:17:12.700
<v Speaker 4>there's some people on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's mostly rats.</v>

3051
02:17:13.080 --> 02:17:14.940
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's mostly fucking ratchet.</v>

3052
02:17:15.150 --> 02:17:16.660
<v Speaker 4>So we are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3053
02:17:16.661 --> 02:17:19.540
<v Speaker 4>if you had a 100 people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a thousand rats on a ship,</v>

3054
02:17:19.570 --> 02:17:22.390
<v Speaker 4>which say that's a ship full of people </v>
<v Speaker 4>or ship full of rats.</v>

3055
02:17:22.780 --> 02:17:23.613
<v Speaker 4>I say it's a ship full of rats and pour </v>
<v Speaker 4>a bunch of poor fuckers trying to get </v>

3056
02:17:26.351 --> 02:17:27.930
<v Speaker 4>some sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3057
02:17:28.110 --> 02:17:28.943
<v Speaker 4>we're just bags of bacteria.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're bags of bacteria and we don't </v>

3058
02:17:32.471 --> 02:17:33.304
<v Speaker 4>understand a lot of it because it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so fucking small and it's </v>

3059
02:17:36.380 --> 02:17:37.580
<v Speaker 4>mysterious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3060
02:17:37.581 --> 02:17:38.414
<v Speaker 4>how about probiotics?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how recent is that where people </v>

3061
02:17:40.421 --> 02:17:44.370
<v Speaker 4>figured out that you have to take in </v>
<v Speaker 4>healthy bacteria in your body every day?</v>

3062
02:17:44.860 --> 02:17:46.270
<v Speaker 4>Two decades,</v>
<v Speaker 4>three decades.</v>

3063
02:17:46.271 --> 02:17:47.800
<v Speaker 4>I meAn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when did you figure that out?</v>

3064
02:17:47.801 --> 02:17:51.070
<v Speaker 4>When do people start taking probiotics?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You take them every day,</v>

3065
02:17:51.071 --> 02:17:52.000
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>because it's over one half of one </v>
<v Speaker 4>percent alcohol and you can't get drunk </v>

3076
02:18:14.800 --> 02:18:17.860
<v Speaker 4>but one half to one percent alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to be 21 to buy it.</v>

3077
02:18:18.580 --> 02:18:19.413
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's that strong over one half of one </v>

3078
02:18:20.951 --> 02:18:23.340
<v Speaker 4>percent and it's made out of like dairy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3079
02:18:23.341 --> 02:18:24.470
<v Speaker 4>It's like raw dairy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3080
02:18:24.471 --> 02:18:24.631
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3081
02:18:24.631 --> 02:18:25.450
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's key for.</v>

3082
02:18:25.450 --> 02:18:28.660
<v Speaker 4>That's a different thing you're thinking</v>
<v Speaker 4>of a key for is like a green.</v>

3083
02:18:29.160 --> 02:18:29.993
<v Speaker 4>It was green involved to somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't understand really how kiefer's </v>

3084
02:18:32.261 --> 02:18:34.210
<v Speaker 4>made somebody explained it to me and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>just blanked out,</v>

3085
02:18:34.750 --> 02:18:37.480
<v Speaker 4>but it's a fungus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of like a fungus.</v>

3086
02:18:38.370 --> 02:18:40.180
<v Speaker 4>It's a growth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some sort of a thing.</v>

3087
02:18:40.480 --> 02:18:41.313
<v Speaker 4>Kombucha.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3088
02:18:41.410 --> 02:18:43.600
<v Speaker 4>I just didn't make it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I used to make it really?</v>

3089
02:18:43.601 --> 02:18:43.881
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3090
02:18:43.881 --> 02:18:46.360
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I first came to la,</v>

3091
02:18:46.450 --> 02:18:49.630
<v Speaker 4>I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this girl I was dating got me a piece.</v>

3092
02:18:49.870 --> 02:18:50.703
<v Speaker 4>She got me like a live organism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She told me how to do it and you'd get </v>

3093
02:18:52.961 --> 02:18:54.640
<v Speaker 4>like a bowl,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a glass bowl,</v>

3094
02:18:54.641 --> 02:18:55.474
<v Speaker 4>like one of the big punch bowls and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>fill the bowl up with sugar and water </v>

3095
02:18:58.870 --> 02:19:00.910
<v Speaker 4>and I forget what the other ingredients </v>
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>

3096
02:19:01.300 --> 02:19:02.133
<v Speaker 4>but you stirred all in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>make it dissolve and then you put the </v>

3097
02:19:04.271 --> 02:19:05.104
<v Speaker 4>fungus in there and then you put it in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the frigerator or you leave it on the </v>

3098
02:19:06.881 --> 02:19:07.900
<v Speaker 4>counter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember.</v>

3099
02:19:07.910 --> 02:19:09.700
<v Speaker 4>What much fungus do you think to leave </v>
<v Speaker 4>it on the counter?</v>

3100
02:19:09.970 --> 02:19:11.390
<v Speaker 4>You just put a good chunk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3101
02:19:11.600 --> 02:19:15.310
<v Speaker 4>You know you have like a piece of this </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff and the longer you let it ferment,</v>

3102
02:19:15.610 --> 02:19:17.170
<v Speaker 4>the stronger the kombucha is going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be.</v>

3103
02:19:17.530 --> 02:19:18.363
<v Speaker 4>And then I would take it in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would pour it into like this big </v>

3104
02:19:22.030 --> 02:19:22.863
<v Speaker 4>bucket and then drink it and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's too much of a pain in the ass </v>

3105
02:19:25.660 --> 02:19:27.070
<v Speaker 4>because you couldn't buy it anywhere </v>
<v Speaker 4>back then.</v>

3106
02:19:27.620 --> 02:19:28.453
<v Speaker 4>The only way you can get it in 1994,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unless you knew some like super hippie </v>

3107
02:19:31.131 --> 02:19:31.964
<v Speaker 4>health food store that sold it most of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the time you got it from other people </v>

3108
02:19:34.790 --> 02:19:36.230
<v Speaker 4>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>does this even work?</v>

3109
02:19:36.260 --> 02:19:38.840
<v Speaker 4>Like doing what am I even doing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's even good for you.</v>

3110
02:19:39.200 --> 02:19:40.011
<v Speaker 4>But I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3111
02:19:40.011 --> 02:19:41.630
<v Speaker 4>she might be right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

3112
02:19:41.710 --> 02:19:44.300
<v Speaker 4>A kombucha everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 4>everyday,</v>

3113
02:19:44.301 --> 02:19:46.880
<v Speaker 4>everyday you have that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or sauerkraut or kimchi.</v>

3114
02:19:46.910 --> 02:19:48.590
<v Speaker 4>Sauerkraut to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love sauerkraut.</v>

3115
02:19:48.620 --> 02:19:51.200
<v Speaker 4>Raw sauerkraut,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but kimchis huge,</v>

3116
02:19:51.260 --> 02:19:56.260
<v Speaker 4>super high in probiotics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like fermented cabbage.</v>

3117
02:19:56.930 --> 02:19:58.920
<v Speaker 4>So it's all like organisms in it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3118
02:19:59.030 --> 02:19:59.863
<v Speaker 4>it's almost shit growing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My stomach feels distended and somebody </v>

3119
02:20:03.771 --> 02:20:05.900
<v Speaker 4>told me that the probiotics can help,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

3120
02:20:05.901 --> 02:20:08.120
<v Speaker 4>There's probably a lot of bacteria in </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

3121
02:20:08.180 --> 02:20:09.013
<v Speaker 4>It could be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would you drink a do take in a lot of </v>

3122
02:20:11.151 --> 02:20:13.910
<v Speaker 4>sugar?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pasta or pasta?</v>

3123
02:20:14.050 --> 02:20:16.220
<v Speaker 4>That's sugar unfortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3124
02:20:16.221 --> 02:20:19.940
<v Speaker 4>I know and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've tried to take a fucking bagel every</v>

3125
02:20:19.940 --> 02:20:21.920
<v Speaker 4>morning and then I try to never have </v>
<v Speaker 4>pasta,</v>

3126
02:20:21.921 --> 02:20:24.740
<v Speaker 4>but unfortunately all that fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>yummy,</v>

3127
02:20:24.741 --> 02:20:25.574
<v Speaker 4>delicious shit.</v>

3128
02:20:25.640 --> 02:20:30.620
<v Speaker 4>Like every now and then I'll let myself </v>
<v Speaker 4>have like a giant pastrami sub.</v>

3129
02:20:30.770 --> 02:20:31.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3130
02:20:31.760 --> 02:20:33.800
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Italian bread,</v>

3131
02:20:34.310 --> 02:20:35.143
<v Speaker 4>mustard and swiss cheese and I love it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you feel like shit afterwards </v>

3132
02:20:39.680 --> 02:20:41.480
<v Speaker 4>because your body has to process all </v>
<v Speaker 4>that sugar.</v>

3133
02:20:41.660 --> 02:20:43.790
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>All that bread is terrible for you.</v>

3134
02:20:43.970 --> 02:20:47.720
<v Speaker 4>So you just eat vegetables and meat for </v>
<v Speaker 4>the most part.</v>

3135
02:20:48.230 --> 02:20:49.730
<v Speaker 4>I mean I fuck around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>

3136
02:20:49.790 --> 02:20:53.520
<v Speaker 4>I don't have a totally strict diet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a mostly strict diet.</v>

3137
02:20:53.570 --> 02:20:56.090
<v Speaker 4>You eat rice sometimes?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most of the time,</v>

3138
02:20:56.091 --> 02:20:58.280
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but sometimes like I'm having sushi.</v>

3139
02:20:58.281 --> 02:20:59.360
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck it,</v>

3140
02:20:59.361 --> 02:21:02.990
<v Speaker 4>let's live more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if I'm not feeling that,</v>

3141
02:21:03.020 --> 02:21:07.860
<v Speaker 4>I'll either appeal the sushi off of the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Off of the rice have succeeded.</v>

3142
02:21:07.900 --> 02:21:09.070
<v Speaker 4>Like sashimi.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3143
02:21:09.440 --> 02:21:11.270
<v Speaker 4>but I'll eat like one out of every </v>
<v Speaker 4>three.</v>

3144
02:21:11.290 --> 02:21:12.890
<v Speaker 4>I'll eat the rice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just gotta.</v>

3145
02:21:13.310 --> 02:21:16.100
<v Speaker 4>If you're on a diet where your body's </v>
<v Speaker 4>fat adapted,</v>

3146
02:21:16.130 --> 02:21:16.963
<v Speaker 4>if it's burning off fat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as soon as you tip the scales and you </v>

3147
02:21:19.701 --> 02:21:21.350
<v Speaker 4>have too many carbohydrates,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like fuck it.</v>

3148
02:21:21.350 --> 02:21:23.510
<v Speaker 4>We're going back to carbohydrates.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you get tired.</v>

3149
02:21:23.511 --> 02:21:24.350
<v Speaker 4>Easy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get hungry.</v>

3150
02:21:24.351 --> 02:21:25.490
<v Speaker 4>Easy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like it.</v>

3151
02:21:25.610 --> 02:21:26.443
<v Speaker 4>It fucks with the system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Once you start getting that fat adapted </v>

3152
02:21:29.091 --> 02:21:29.924
<v Speaker 4>state and it's hard when you're out to </v>
<v Speaker 4>eat a decent lunch that doesn't have </v>

3153
02:21:33.471 --> 02:21:35.720
<v Speaker 4>carbs in it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything's a fucking sandwich.</v>

3154
02:21:35.750 --> 02:21:38.150
<v Speaker 4>Salads,</v>
<v Speaker 4>salads,</v>

3155
02:21:38.180 --> 02:21:40.460

<v Speaker 4>Salmon is really good.</v>

3156
02:21:40.461 --> 02:21:42.050
<v Speaker 4>It's cutting oils in it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Healthy oils.</v>

3157
02:21:42.440 --> 02:21:45.080
<v Speaker 4>Ask them for olive oil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pour the olive oil on the salad.</v>

3158
02:21:45.200 --> 02:21:46.880

<v Speaker 4>either,</v>

3159
02:21:46.881 --> 02:21:48.340

<v Speaker 4>most salad dressings are bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3161
02:21:50.630 --> 02:21:53.240

<v Speaker 1>have a lot of misguided misconceptions </v>
<v Speaker 1>about gmo foods,</v>

3198
02:23:17.250 --> 02:23:20.070
<v Speaker 1>Really smart guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was explaining that they all used</v>

3199
02:23:20.071 --> 02:23:20.904
<v Speaker 1>to be like crab apples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll still be like kind of sour and </v>

3200
02:23:22.591 --> 02:23:24.300
<v Speaker 1>you can eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You remember crab apples when you were a</v>

3201
02:23:24.301 --> 02:23:25.950
<v Speaker 1>kId.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We throw them at each other,</v>

3202
02:23:26.420 --> 02:23:28.640
<v Speaker 1>throw them at cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are little tiny things.</v>

3203
02:23:28.680 --> 02:23:30.870
<v Speaker 1>Green and they were salary shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could eat them,</v>

3204
02:23:30.871 --> 02:23:31.704
<v Speaker 1>you'd eat them if you're really hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most of the time you wouldn't eat </v>

3205
02:23:33.091 --> 02:23:33.720
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3206
02:23:33.720 --> 02:23:35.520
<v Speaker 1>that's what apparently with apples used </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be.</v>

3207
02:23:35.970 --> 02:23:40.970
<v Speaker 1>Those were wild apples and people if I </v>
<v Speaker 1>just take that and I don't know how they</v>

3208
02:23:41.221 --> 02:23:42.054
<v Speaker 1>do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they figured out how to splice </v>

3209
02:23:42.781 --> 02:23:43.614
<v Speaker 1>things and change things and selectively</v>
<v Speaker 1>breed certain plants and they came up </v>

3210
02:23:48.871 --> 02:23:51.630
<v Speaker 1>with different strains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why corn looks the way it looks.</v>

3211
02:23:52.110 --> 02:23:52.943
<v Speaker 1>Old school corn was like the size of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hobos dick and it was so naughty and </v>

3212
02:23:57.691 --> 02:23:59.490
<v Speaker 1>fucked up look and it was like four </v>
<v Speaker 1>inches long.</v>

3213
02:23:59.491 --> 02:24:01.950
<v Speaker 1>So it's A little tiny thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It tastes the same.</v>

3214
02:24:02.490 --> 02:24:04.110
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a hobos dick.</v>

3215
02:24:04.260 --> 02:24:05.640
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hobos dicks are weird,</v>

3216
02:24:05.641 --> 02:24:06.870
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're so variable.</v>

3217
02:24:09.360 --> 02:24:10.193
<v Speaker 4>You never know what you get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it could be a recent hobo and be </v>

3218
02:24:12.111 --> 02:24:13.100
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that guy who punched you.</v>

3219
02:24:13.130 --> 02:24:15.790
<v Speaker 4>Just old school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not blowing veteran.</v>

3220
02:24:16.170 --> 02:24:20.080
<v Speaker 4>His dick tastes like battery acid </v>
<v Speaker 4>addict.</v>

3221
02:24:20.090 --> 02:24:20.923
<v Speaker 4>That's been through the pacific </v>
<v Speaker 4>southwest for guys just doing nothing </v>

<v Speaker 4>What do you think that tastes?</v>

3223
02:24:26.270 --> 02:24:30.260
<v Speaker 4>Because if they say that like a guide </v>
<v Speaker 4>drinks orange juice has come,</v>

3224
02:24:30.261 --> 02:24:31.910

3225
02:24:31.940 --> 02:24:33.170

<v Speaker 4>Whenever I heard that,</v>

3226

<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how many dicks do you have to suck for </v>

<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3232
02:24:55.941 --> 02:24:58.670
<v Speaker 4>If a guy eats pineapples,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pineapples is cum.</v>

3233
02:24:58.671 --> 02:25:01.250

<v Speaker 2>LIke somebody earned that money is given</v>
<v Speaker 2>to you as a gift when they die.</v>

3416
02:33:05.900 --> 02:33:08.030
<v Speaker 2>Like you shouldn't have to pay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not earned income.</v>

3417
02:33:08.810 --> 02:33:09.643
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's only over one point $8,000,000 for </v>

3418
02:33:12.291 --> 02:33:15.470
<v Speaker 2>a couple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my feeling is one point 8 million.</v>

3419
02:33:15.471 --> 02:33:16.304
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean that's the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't pay any inheritance tax under </v>

3420
02:33:19.061 --> 02:33:21.110
<v Speaker 2>one point $8,000,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3421
02:33:21.111 --> 02:33:21.944
<v Speaker 2>So to me it feels like the framers of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the constitution had come from europe </v>

3422
02:33:25.580 --> 02:33:28.970
<v Speaker 2>where money had been handed down through</v>
<v Speaker 2>generations,</v>

3423
02:33:28.971 --> 02:33:32.150
<v Speaker 2>aristocracies useless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wasteful,</v>

3424
02:33:32.210 --> 02:33:35.240
<v Speaker 2>dangerous motherfuckers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when they set up the constitution,</v>

3425
02:33:35.241 --> 02:33:40.241
<v Speaker 2>they said we need to have an estate tax </v>
<v Speaker 2>to try to keep the money from all ending</v>

3426
02:33:40.311 --> 02:33:43.460
<v Speaker 2>up in the hands of a few families and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm all for it.</v>

3427
02:33:43.490 --> 02:33:47.540
<v Speaker 2>I think then if you end up with more </v>
<v Speaker 2>than one point $8,000,000 a year,</v>

3428
02:33:47.541 --> 02:33:51.050
<v Speaker 2>kids are set as well as their educations</v>
<v Speaker 2>will be set.</v>

3429
02:33:51.290 --> 02:33:54.560
<v Speaker 2>That's a down payment on a house and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then let them earn their fucking way.</v>

3430
02:33:54.950 --> 02:33:55.970
<v Speaker 2>That's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually.</v>

3431
02:33:56.030 --> 02:33:56.863
<v Speaker 2>I never thought about that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I didn't think actually </v>

3432
02:33:59.240 --> 02:34:02.660
<v Speaker 2>honestly as weird as that or did think </v>
<v Speaker 2>rather than that I have the problem with</v>

3433
02:34:02.661 --> 02:34:04.010
<v Speaker 2>is the money's going to go to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>

3434
02:34:04.280 --> 02:34:05.750
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem is where does the </v>
<v Speaker 2>money go?</v>

3435
02:34:05.790 --> 02:34:08.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd be one thing if you had inheritance</v>

3436
02:34:08.601 --> 02:34:10.880
<v Speaker 2>tax and it went towards a worthwhile </v>
<v Speaker 2>charity,</v>

3437
02:34:10.920 --> 02:34:13.400
<v Speaker 2>like should be able to pick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should be able to pick your chair.</v>

3438
02:34:13.480 --> 02:34:14.350
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

3439
02:34:14.360 --> 02:34:15.380
<v Speaker 2>That's the way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3440
02:34:15.381 --> 02:34:17.900
<v Speaker 2>instead of giving it to the government </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they spend as they wish,</v>

3441
02:34:17.901 --> 02:34:19.510
<v Speaker 2>they didn't even have to have a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>receipt.</v>

3442
02:34:19.780 --> 02:34:21.730
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to have an audit of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they do.</v>

3443
02:34:22.090 --> 02:34:23.980
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at what warren buffett is doing</v>

3444
02:34:23.981 --> 02:34:26.020
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's giving it away before he dies.</v>

3445
02:34:26.020 --> 02:34:28.390
<v Speaker 2>That's what you gotta do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you want to control where it goes,</v>

3446
02:34:28.720 --> 02:34:29.553
<v Speaker 2>give it away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Save a couple million because that's </v>

3447
02:34:32.141 --> 02:34:34.540
<v Speaker 2>what your kids will get and fucking give</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rest away the way you wanT to.</v>

3448
02:34:34.570 --> 02:34:37.360
<v Speaker 2>He's basically given it all away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ninety nine percent of it.</v>

3449
02:34:37.390 --> 02:34:39.850
<v Speaker 2>That's so insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This documentary about him.</v>

3450
02:34:39.851 --> 02:34:40.684
<v Speaker 2>That's really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this guy like he literally lives </v>

3451
02:34:43.451 --> 02:34:47.620
<v Speaker 2>in the same house he bought when he </v>
<v Speaker 2>first moved to omaha,</v>

3452
02:34:47.621 --> 02:34:49.510
<v Speaker 2>Nebraska.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how's that possible?</v>

3453
02:34:49.511 --> 02:34:51.610
<v Speaker 2>Like how?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who watches his house?</v>

3454
02:34:51.611 --> 02:34:53.470
<v Speaker 2>like people must want to kidnap him all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>

3455
02:34:53.500 --> 02:34:54.333
<v Speaker 2>He stays right there on the street.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd fucking show a picture of it </v>

3456
02:34:57.070 --> 02:34:58.840
<v Speaker 2>because you have like guards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3457
02:34:59.140 --> 02:34:59.973
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He drives to the same mcdonald's every </v>

3458
02:35:01.601 --> 02:35:02.434
<v Speaker 2>morning does he?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he either gets an egg mcmuffin with </v>

3459
02:35:04.151 --> 02:35:04.984
<v Speaker 2>sausage and the egg mcmuffin with bacon </v>
<v Speaker 2>depending on as the stock market is up </v>

3460
02:35:08.021 --> 02:35:08.770

<v Speaker 2>It's a dollar 68.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have that exact amount of money.</v>

3464

<v Speaker 2>It's enough in car.</v>

3470
02:35:31.330 --> 02:35:34.150
<v Speaker 2>Maybe people don't believe he's that </v>
<v Speaker 2>rich and that's why they don't rob him.</v>

3471
02:35:34.450 --> 02:35:38.080
<v Speaker 2>I think he's like the fifth richest </v>
<v Speaker 2>person in the world or something.</v>

<v Speaker 4>And then he,</v>

3666
02:45:16.750 --> 02:45:17.583
