00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:01.920
<v Speaker 1>Three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

2
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.650
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

3
00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:09.810
<v Speaker 1>It feels like you would just hear what </v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't know.</v>

4
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:11.790
<v Speaker 1>Most people don't know because it hasn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>come out yet.</v>

5
00:00:11.791 --> 00:00:12.720
<v Speaker 1>No one would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How would they?</v>

6
00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:13.603
<v Speaker 1>We've bid a podcast late last night and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it got completely out of hand so that I </v>

7
00:00:20.851 --> 00:00:22.680
<v Speaker 1>don't even know what to do with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing now.</v>

8
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.910
<v Speaker 1>What's that thing out like a gentleman?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

9
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm certainly putting it out on </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretending,</v>

10
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.240
<v Speaker 1>putting out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So long story short for listeners,</v>

11
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:31.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe was kind enough to.</v>

12
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.610
<v Speaker 1>I was interviewing Sam Harris for my </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast and Sam was like,</v>

13
00:00:35.611 --> 00:00:36.444
<v Speaker 1>we really should just do more than just </v>
<v Speaker 1>a one on one because ordinarily my </v>

14
00:00:38.311 --> 00:00:41.640
<v Speaker 1>podcast is about as a panel of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of people sitting around talking</v>

15
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.670
<v Speaker 1>about the news and so I texted Joe and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

16
00:00:44.671 --> 00:00:46.740
<v Speaker 1>is there any chance of doing it at your </v>
<v Speaker 1>studio?</v>

17
00:00:46.741 --> 00:00:48.360
<v Speaker 1>And being the gentleman that he is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

18
00:00:48.361 --> 00:00:49.980
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just come on by and we'll just type it.</v>

19
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.520
<v Speaker 1>Even though he had two shows yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So after those shows,</v>

20
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.383
<v Speaker 1>late at night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sam Harris comes over and Hannibal </v>

21
00:00:57.661 --> 00:01:02.661
<v Speaker 1>buress is still here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was about to call an uber and I said,</v>

22
00:01:03.181 --> 00:01:04.620
<v Speaker 1>why don't you stick around?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

23
00:01:04.621 --> 00:01:07.200
<v Speaker 1>hang on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were drunk based the way we drink,</v>

24
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.930
<v Speaker 1>so much whiskey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>best decision you ever made,</v>

25
00:01:09.931 --> 00:01:10.764
<v Speaker 1>inviting him to stay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so Hannibal buress and Sam Harris and </v>

26
00:01:14.461 --> 00:01:15.294
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan and I have an interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>episode of my podcast which will come </v>

27
00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:18.834
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you're listening to this now or </v>

28
00:01:20.251 --> 00:01:23.010
<v Speaker 1>watching this now subscribed to way the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people live.</v>

29
00:01:23.011 --> 00:01:23.844
<v Speaker 1>Just switch for whether people space </v>
<v Speaker 1>life you need the live and then when it </v>

30
00:01:26.191 --> 00:01:27.690
<v Speaker 1>drops you will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will see it.</v>

31
00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:28.583
<v Speaker 1>It was an dining epic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our long argument between Hannibal </v>

32
00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:33.343
<v Speaker 1>Burress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a drunk Hannibal burress and Sam Harris </v>

33
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.760
<v Speaker 1>regarding statistics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll just leave it at that.</v>

34
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:39.633
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to give him more </v>

35
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.470
<v Speaker 1>statistics that may or may not involve </v>
<v Speaker 1>black lives matter.</v>

36
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:44.623
<v Speaker 1>I'm shooting police shootings and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>the reality of police violence versus </v>

37
00:01:50.431 --> 00:01:52.560
<v Speaker 1>the perceived reality of police </v>
<v Speaker 1>violence.</v>

38
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.423
<v Speaker 1>So arguing about the statistics rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>than the emotional connection and the </v>

39
00:01:57.211 --> 00:01:58.044
<v Speaker 1>difference and what was interesting is </v>
<v Speaker 1>how we have conversations about things </v>

40
00:02:00.361 --> 00:02:01.350
<v Speaker 1>that are so touchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

41
00:02:01.351 --> 00:02:03.310
<v Speaker 1>I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the reason why I want to talk to</v>

42
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.650
<v Speaker 1>Sam and you on my podcast is because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think it's important for us to find ways</v>

43
00:02:07.651 --> 00:02:11.010
<v Speaker 1>to have the sorts of conversations that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have in that Sam has and hopefully I</v>

44
00:02:11.011 --> 00:02:15.780
<v Speaker 1>have where there's not a lot of kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>opinionated bloviating.</v>

45
00:02:15.781 --> 00:02:17.700
<v Speaker 1>It's more about actually trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand each other,</v>

46
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.830
<v Speaker 1>but actually trying to take each other </v>
<v Speaker 1>at face value,</v>

47
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.910
<v Speaker 1>not sticking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

48
00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.950
<v Speaker 1>a what a sword in the sand and saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

49
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.850
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe that you offended me or </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

50
00:02:26.851 --> 00:02:27.684
<v Speaker 1>having tripwires that if someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>transgresses that'll says a certain </v>

51
00:02:29.821 --> 00:02:30.654
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then all of a sudden you're going to </v>

52
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.050
<v Speaker 1>crank up the outrage machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So much of that,</v>

53
00:02:34.051 --> 00:02:36.810
<v Speaker 1>so much of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I wanted to talk to Sam and you about</v>

54
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.673
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do we have conversations that are </v>

55
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.260
<v Speaker 1>the more reasonable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of course you don't necessarily have</v>

56
00:02:43.261 --> 00:02:44.094
<v Speaker 1>a conversation that's that reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're drunk and emotionally </v>

57
00:02:47.881 --> 00:02:48.900
<v Speaker 1>sensitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Drunk.</v>

58
00:02:48.901 --> 00:02:53.130
<v Speaker 1>Hannibal burress says that he's smarter </v>
<v Speaker 1>than Sam Harris and smarter than I think</v>

59
00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:54.330
<v Speaker 1>anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't he say anyone?</v>

60
00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.253
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he definitely said he was smarter than </v>

61
00:02:56.011 --> 00:02:57.630
<v Speaker 1>Sam Harris.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hannibal's a smart guy,</v>

62
00:02:57.631 --> 00:03:00.550
<v Speaker 1>he must be successful and he's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>compelling</v>

63
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:01.463
<v Speaker 2>and good comic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just not smart enough to know that he </v>

64
00:03:02.921 --> 00:03:07.690
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't say smart Sam Harris.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was drunk,</v>

65
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.670
<v Speaker 2>really drunk and we kept drinking to </v>
<v Speaker 2>view.</v>

66
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:12.550
<v Speaker 2>Hit it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

67
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:13.810
<v Speaker 2>you hold your liquor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

68
00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.150
<v Speaker 2>I bounced back quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm healthy.</v>

69
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.280
<v Speaker 2>So I stopped drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also.</v>

70
00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.933
<v Speaker 2>Loyalty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what you're implying exactly what I </v>

71
00:03:20.781 --> 00:03:22.950
<v Speaker 2>said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You heard me and uh,</v>

72
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.830
<v Speaker 2>about an hour before the end of our pod,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have me in Hannibal,</v>

73
00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:28.630
<v Speaker 2>I realized I was drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I backed off.</v>

74
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.160
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he going,</v>

75
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.660
<v Speaker 2>he was preparing himself out like half a</v>
<v Speaker 2>half a wine glass of whiskey.</v>

76
00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:35.680
<v Speaker 2>Yup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

77
00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:36.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was deep.</v>

78
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.620
<v Speaker 2>We went deep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

79
00:03:38.621 --> 00:03:40.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he can't be held responsible folks.</v>

80
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:42.360
<v Speaker 2>Everyone was helping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

81
00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.370
<v Speaker 2>Because if you drive drunk and kill </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody,</v>

82
00:03:45.371 --> 00:03:49.390
<v Speaker 2>then you're not held responsible for </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

83
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:50.740
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're a woman,</v>

84
00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.963
<v Speaker 2>you can have sex with someone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not responsible though the man's </v>

85
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.180
<v Speaker 2>responsible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right,</v>

86
00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.990
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>

87
00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.823
<v Speaker 2>So it was more of a woman having sex </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a drunk driver hitting that high </v>

88
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.240
<v Speaker 2>bar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more of a woman.</v>

89
00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:05.080
<v Speaker 2>And I bet I'll tell him you said that he</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a guest in my studio.</v>

90
00:04:05.081 --> 00:04:05.800
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

91
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:06.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm responsible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't,</v>

92
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.530
<v Speaker 2>he could not consent conversation you </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the chaperone.</v>

93
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.883
<v Speaker 2>He was too drunk to consent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was the rapist raped him with our </v>

94
00:04:14.501 --> 00:04:15.334
<v Speaker 2>conversation by forcing him into this </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation that I didn't know he was </v>

95
00:04:17.741 --> 00:04:18.790
<v Speaker 2>going to get into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

96
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.010
<v Speaker 2>You sort of annually fisted him with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Woodward.</v>

97
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.440
<v Speaker 2>Now you go into a little of my own taste</v>
<v Speaker 2>you said.</v>

98
00:04:23.441 --> 00:04:25.600
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about this whole,</v>

99
00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.410
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you been,</v>

100
00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.360
<v Speaker 2>have you been talking with thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the whole,</v>

101
00:04:28.361 --> 00:04:30.220
<v Speaker 2>like Amy Schumer cut and myths good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

102
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.050
<v Speaker 2>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I saw what he said and you know,</v>

103
00:04:35.051 --> 00:04:39.370
<v Speaker 2>I had someone else contact me about that</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy and whether or not,</v>

104
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:40.263
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was telling the truth or the woman </v>

105
00:04:42.041 --> 00:04:42.850
<v Speaker 2>was telling the truth.</v>

106
00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:43.683
<v Speaker 2>I don't know him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know her and I'm not getting </v>

107
00:04:45.161 --> 00:04:49.300
<v Speaker 2>involved because I don't know if I knew </v>
<v Speaker 2>her and I could implicitly trust her.</v>

108
00:04:49.301 --> 00:04:52.390
<v Speaker 2>And I knew that she was going to tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>the truth and it's not,</v>

109
00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:53.553
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

110
00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:54.453
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't understand the motivation </v>

111
00:04:55.691 --> 00:04:57.640
<v Speaker 2>behind someone jumping in with an </v>
<v Speaker 2>opinion.</v>

112
00:04:57.641 --> 00:05:00.370
<v Speaker 2>I think what he's saying though is </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting because what Kurt was saying</v>

113
00:05:00.371 --> 00:05:03.780
<v Speaker 2>was that it is entirely possible he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>satire,</v>

114
00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:04.653
<v Speaker 2>obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you're saying women cannot lie </v>

115
00:05:05.951 --> 00:05:06.910
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like my Bible.</v>

116
00:05:06.911 --> 00:05:09.370
<v Speaker 2>It's impossible for a woman to lodge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like the Lord's word.</v>

117
00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:10.601
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

118
00:05:10.601 --> 00:05:12.580
<v Speaker 2>he's being funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's hilarious.</v>

119
00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:13.600
<v Speaker 2>Shitster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

120
00:05:13.601 --> 00:05:14.890
<v Speaker 2>he's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

121
00:05:14.891 --> 00:05:16.650
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

122
00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.140
<v Speaker 2>it's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

123
00:05:18.141 --> 00:05:23.110
<v Speaker 2>like that there's this culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we know for a fact that some people</v>

124
00:05:23.111 --> 00:05:27.460
<v Speaker 2>lie about every single aspect of life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They lie about what they did.</v>

125
00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:30.250
<v Speaker 2>They lie about their taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they lie about everything.</v>

126
00:05:30.251 --> 00:05:33.310
<v Speaker 2>But we're supposed to assume that women </v>
<v Speaker 2>never lie about rape.</v>

127
00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.830
<v Speaker 2>And it's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know it's not true,</v>

128
00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:37.840
<v Speaker 2>but we're not allowed to say it's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>

129
00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.030
<v Speaker 2>Even though we know it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not allowed to bring it up.</v>

130
00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.470
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if there's a possibility,</v>

131
00:05:41.471 --> 00:05:42.304
<v Speaker 2>if a woman says that she's raped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to accept that 100 percent at </v>

132
00:05:44.981 --> 00:05:47.050
<v Speaker 2>face value.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if the man is saying he didn't rape</v>

133
00:05:47.051 --> 00:05:49.990
<v Speaker 2>her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really hard because that's one side</v>

134
00:05:49.991 --> 00:05:50.824
<v Speaker 2>of the ledger and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then on the other side of the </v>

135
00:05:52.061 --> 00:05:52.894
<v Speaker 2>ledger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got all of the overwhelming </v>

136
00:05:54.371 --> 00:05:56.530
<v Speaker 2>number of cases where men get away with </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

137
00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.430
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because women are too afraid</v>

138
00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.263
<v Speaker 1>to go to the police or they feel like </v>
<v Speaker 1>they feel like they're dirty or that </v>

139
00:06:01.641 --> 00:06:02.474
<v Speaker 1>somehow for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just not talk about it and let it go </v>

140
00:06:05.231 --> 00:06:06.064
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that I think that women's </v>

141
00:06:06.951 --> 00:06:09.460
<v Speaker 1>rights people and feminists think like </v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

142
00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.260
<v Speaker 1>if it's occasionally the case that a man</v>
<v Speaker 1>is wrongly accused,</v>

143
00:06:12.261 --> 00:06:13.094
<v Speaker 1>that's a small price to pay for </v>
<v Speaker 1>fostering a climate in which women feel </v>

144
00:06:16.101 --> 00:06:19.280
<v Speaker 1>more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel less nervous about coming forward.</v>

145
00:06:19.281 --> 00:06:22.610
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm not saying that I believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but wow,</v>

146
00:06:22.611 --> 00:06:23.444
<v Speaker 1>what a shitstorm Kurt has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not sure if everyone knows the </v>

147
00:06:26.451 --> 00:06:27.770
<v Speaker 1>background of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there was a.</v>

148
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:28.633
<v Speaker 1>One of the comics that UCB theater in </v>
<v Speaker 1>New York was accused of being a repeat </v>

149
00:06:32.031 --> 00:06:32.864
<v Speaker 1>sexual offender by a bunch of women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So say suspended him as a comic and </v>

150
00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:39.793
<v Speaker 1>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and conducted its own internal </v>

151
00:06:41.661 --> 00:06:44.780
<v Speaker 1>investigation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Kurt went on a big facebook rants.</v>

152
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.000
<v Speaker 1>I was looking at it this morning </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually saying,</v>

153
00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm basically like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is this internal?</v>

154
00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.210
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is this like the Catholic church,</v>

155
00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.560
<v Speaker 1>the UCB theater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like doing the internal investigation.</v>

156
00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:58.640
<v Speaker 1>Why didn't these women go to go to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>police?</v>

157
00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.160
<v Speaker 1>He writes a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is his original facebook post.</v>

158
00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.200
<v Speaker 1>Guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've just heard some disturbing news.</v>

159
00:07:03.201 --> 00:07:07.280
<v Speaker 1>This Guy Jeff Delfi Berg is a rapist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know because women said it,</v>

160
00:07:07.281 --> 00:07:09.890
<v Speaker 1>and that's all I need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never you mind who they are.</v>

161
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:12.980
<v Speaker 1>They're all women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All women are as reliable as my Bible.</v>

162
00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.800
<v Speaker 1>A book that much like a woman is </v>
<v Speaker 1>incapable of lying.</v>

163
00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:20.090
<v Speaker 1>So what you were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think I would dare ask my God,</v>

164
00:07:20.091 --> 00:07:20.924
<v Speaker 1>Lord Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then Nazareen to provide any details or </v>

165
00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:27.620
<v Speaker 1>evidence of any kind before I believe in</v>
<v Speaker 1>him or a woman.</v>

166
00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:29.720
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that would be like hammering the</v>

167
00:07:29.721 --> 00:07:33.200
<v Speaker 1>nails into Jesus my Lord's feet or </v>
<v Speaker 1>rewriting the victims.</v>

168
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:38.230
<v Speaker 1>Good whole asking for proof in a murder </v>
<v Speaker 1>trial and he goes on like that.</v>

169
00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:41.030
<v Speaker 1>I made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really funny.</v>

170
00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:44.270
<v Speaker 1>If that guy's innocent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that guy's guilty,</v>

171
00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:48.620
<v Speaker 1>then it becomes really disturbing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kind of become a name and an enabler.</v>

172
00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:49.483
<v Speaker 1>Problem is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no way Kurt can know exactly </v>

173
00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.490
<v Speaker 1>exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do.</v>

174
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:55.750
<v Speaker 1>I think it raises interesting questions </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the whole kind of the,</v>

175
00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:57.213
<v Speaker 1>the censorious and like the hysteria of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Social Justice Warrior Brigade in </v>

176
00:08:01.191 --> 00:08:04.450
<v Speaker 1>that there are people who really fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>want him to get fired and never,</v>

177
00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:06.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if amy's show comes back,</v>

178
00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:07.790
<v Speaker 1>they don't want him back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a writer,</v>

179
00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:08.743
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that there are a comedy clubs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're going to rethink whether or </v>

180
00:08:11.211 --> 00:08:15.110
<v Speaker 1>not they want to book him because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>might be too toxic and I doubt that.</v>

181
00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:16.500
<v Speaker 1>Maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe not.</v>

182
00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:21.050
<v Speaker 1>It's not that big of a deal because what</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said was not that big of a deal,</v>

183
00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:22.880
<v Speaker 1>but the issue and everyone went crazy.</v>

184
00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:26.030
<v Speaker 1>She went crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She posted the amy did.</v>

185
00:08:26.031 --> 00:08:27.330
<v Speaker 1>She posted this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

186
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:28.183
<v Speaker 1>saying that she's very disappointed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was in response to an endless </v>

187
00:08:31.041 --> 00:08:31.874
<v Speaker 1>barrage of social justice people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>feminist saying that this is completely </v>

188
00:08:35.451 --> 00:08:37.130
<v Speaker 1>unacceptable and he deserves to be fired</v>
<v Speaker 1>for it.</v>

189
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.740
<v Speaker 1>He has a job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He showed some pretty incredible loyalty</v>

190
00:08:39.741 --> 00:08:42.290
<v Speaker 1>to her during that whole plagiarism </v>
<v Speaker 1>scandal,</v>

191
00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:43.333
<v Speaker 1>especially when he was one of the ones </v>
<v Speaker 1>who told her to not do one of those </v>

192
00:08:46.851 --> 00:08:49.250
<v Speaker 1>jokes because it was a windy liebman </v>
<v Speaker 1>joke,</v>

193
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:50.623
<v Speaker 1>so he kept his mud about all that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then she turned on him with this whole </v>

194
00:08:54.081 --> 00:08:56.160
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing is very sorted</v>

195
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:57.023
<v Speaker 3>and I see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see her point of view and I see his </v>

196
00:08:58.501 --> 00:08:59.550
<v Speaker 3>point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really do.</v>

197
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:00.413
<v Speaker 3>I think she didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think she felt she didn't have an </v>

198
00:09:01.441 --> 00:09:02.274
<v Speaker 3>option,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but because she did say I could see my </v>

199
00:09:03.601 --> 00:09:06.810
<v Speaker 3>friend and knowing him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm disappointed in him.</v>

200
00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:09.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's toxic.</v>

201
00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:10.800
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's no way that you can talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

202
00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:13.420
<v Speaker 3>You can't raise the question that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>just raised.</v>

203
00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:15.450
<v Speaker 3>Unless you're on the Joe Rogan </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>

204
00:09:15.451 --> 00:09:18.270
<v Speaker 3>You cannot raise the question of whether</v>
<v Speaker 3>or not it's appropriate,</v>

205
00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:20.460
<v Speaker 3>whether they should be in a presumption </v>
<v Speaker 3>of innocence.</v>

206
00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:21.323
<v Speaker 3>That's why podcasts are so God damn </v>
<v Speaker 3>important as you could never do this on </v>

207
00:09:23.371 --> 00:09:24.204
<v Speaker 3>a regular show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Certainly couldn't do the shit we went </v>

208
00:09:25.201 --> 00:09:27.600
<v Speaker 3>on last night on a regular show off the </v>
<v Speaker 3>air.</v>

209
00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.200
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wait till it comes out,</v>

210
00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.570
<v Speaker 4>Woo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

211
00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:33.220
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's the PR again.</v>

212
00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:35.720
<v Speaker 4>Here's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If that guy is innocent,</v>

213
00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:40.780
<v Speaker 4>then Kurt is doing a service because he </v>
<v Speaker 4>is expressing this very real possibility</v>

214
00:09:41.571 --> 00:09:44.360
<v Speaker 4>that someone might be lying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If that guy's guilty,</v>

215
00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:45.583
<v Speaker 4>then it's not funny at all and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>becomes really fucking gross for the </v>

216
00:09:48.441 --> 00:09:49.274
<v Speaker 4>girl if she has to sit back and listen </v>
<v Speaker 4>to someone mock whether or not she's </v>

217
00:09:51.801 --> 00:09:53.330
<v Speaker 4>telling the truth when she knows she </v>
<v Speaker 4>did.</v>

218
00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:58.720
<v Speaker 4>That has got to be a horrible feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the question is,</v>

219
00:09:58.821 --> 00:09:59.654
<v Speaker 4>what is worse?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it worse to get falsely accused of </v>

220
00:10:01.701 --> 00:10:02.534
<v Speaker 4>rape or is it worse to get raped when </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone doesn't believe you and get </v>

221
00:10:05.601 --> 00:10:06.434
<v Speaker 4>accused of being a liar?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's obviously worse to get raped and </v>

222
00:10:09.171 --> 00:10:11.120
<v Speaker 4>being accused of alive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but by how much,</v>

223
00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:14.210
<v Speaker 4>I mean if you grading on a scale like </v>
<v Speaker 4>getting getting,</v>

224
00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:15.373
<v Speaker 4>I mean let's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's just assume it's at least a bit </v>

225
00:10:20.361 --> 00:10:22.190
<v Speaker 4>worse on that side</v>

226
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:23.063
<v Speaker 3>because you use the physical right is </v>
<v Speaker 3>worse than being falsely accused but </v>

227
00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:26.573
<v Speaker 3>surely</v>

228
00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:28.243
<v Speaker 4>in having your career destroyed and </v>
<v Speaker 4>dragged through the mud and forever </v>

229
00:10:31.011 --> 00:10:31.844
<v Speaker 4>labeled a rapist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is entirely possible for someone </v>

230
00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:35.090
<v Speaker 4>is innocent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It happened to a friend of mine,</v>

231
00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:37.700
<v Speaker 4>a friend of mine got accused falsely of </v>
<v Speaker 4>rape.</v>

232
00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:40.490
<v Speaker 4>This girl that he was dating,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he broke up with her.</v>

233
00:10:40.491 --> 00:10:43.190
<v Speaker 4>They broke up and she just decided that </v>
<v Speaker 4>she was going to get back at him,</v>

234
00:10:43.191 --> 00:10:44.024
<v Speaker 4>so she said that he was a rapist and she</v>
<v Speaker 4>followed through with it for awhile and </v>

235
00:10:46.071 --> 00:10:46.904
<v Speaker 4>then eventually abandoned it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that does happen and it's happened </v>

236
00:10:50.361 --> 00:10:51.194
<v Speaker 4>many,</v>
<v Speaker 4>many times and there's a bunch of </v>

237
00:10:51.891 --> 00:10:52.724
<v Speaker 4>statistics you can look up online,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're not entirely accurate </v>

238
00:10:55.101 --> 00:10:57.980
<v Speaker 4>because they don't take into account how</v>
<v Speaker 4>many women leave.</v>

239
00:10:57.981 --> 00:11:01.360
<v Speaker 4>You look into like overall rapes and </v>
<v Speaker 4>overall people who lie it,</v>

240
00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:06.370
<v Speaker 4>rape the overall rape statistics are not</v>
<v Speaker 4>accurate because they do not know nor do</v>

241
00:11:06.651 --> 00:11:07.484
<v Speaker 4>they take into account or can they </v>
<v Speaker 4>possibly take into account how many </v>

242
00:11:09.951 --> 00:11:12.410
<v Speaker 4>women don't say anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a big number.</v>

243
00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:15.280
<v Speaker 3>And also like what constitutes a rape </v>
<v Speaker 3>exam.</v>

244
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:16.183
<v Speaker 3>Like when you say that with some men </v>
<v Speaker 3>have falsely accused is not always as </v>

245
00:11:18.831 --> 00:11:20.690
<v Speaker 3>black and white as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

246
00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:21.623
<v Speaker 3>they were dating and they never even had</v>
<v Speaker 3>sex at all but she suddenly accuses him </v>

247
00:11:24.141 --> 00:11:24.561
<v Speaker 3>of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

248
00:11:24.561 --> 00:11:25.394
<v Speaker 3>But there are also scenarios where as </v>
<v Speaker 3>you said before she was drunk or like </v>

249
00:11:28.911 --> 00:11:29.744
<v Speaker 3>she didn't know that he thought there </v>
<v Speaker 3>was consent and there wasn't consent or </v>

250
00:11:32.661 --> 00:11:33.110
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

251
00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:34.280
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or maybe they were,</v>

252
00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:35.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's,</v>

253
00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:36.223
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a vague area and I think Kurt's </v>

254
00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:39.433
<v Speaker 3>point which is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that we should be having </v>

255
00:11:42.321 --> 00:11:45.800
<v Speaker 3>to choose between the two options that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you just cited,</v>

256
00:11:45.801 --> 00:11:49.310
<v Speaker 3>which is on the one hand a woman gets </v>
<v Speaker 3>raped and is not believed.</v>

257
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:52.220
<v Speaker 3>And on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a man is falsely accused of rape.</v>

258
00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.670
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what Kurt is trying to do,</v>

259
00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:56.500
<v Speaker 3>just in a clumsy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>smart ass,</v>

260
00:11:56.501 --> 00:12:01.501
<v Speaker 3>he a flame throwing way is say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can it be true that rape is really,</v>

261
00:12:02.261 --> 00:12:03.094
<v Speaker 3>really terrible and we also should,</v>
<v Speaker 3>should offer men the benefit of the </v>

262
00:12:06.461 --> 00:12:07.294
<v Speaker 3>doubt and encourage rape victims to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the police rather than to internal </v>

263
00:12:11.651 --> 00:12:13.660
<v Speaker 3>investigations at places like Uc Bay.</v>

264
00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:17.950
<v Speaker 3>His point is like he thinks he's on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>side of the rape victims,</v>

265
00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:19.563
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>By saying like they've been sold a dumb </v>

266
00:12:21.161 --> 00:12:24.550
<v Speaker 3>bill of goods by feminists by saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh your such poor,</v>

267
00:12:24.551 --> 00:12:25.384
<v Speaker 3>pathetic victims that you can't go to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the police and it will never be taken </v>

268
00:12:26.981 --> 00:12:29.260
<v Speaker 3>care of by going to the police.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you should just be mollycoddled and,</v>

269
00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:32.500
<v Speaker 3>and you should either remain silent or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or you know,</v>

270
00:12:32.501 --> 00:12:37.501
<v Speaker 3>just to have it sorted out internally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think he's saying when he says,</v>

271
00:12:38.081 --> 00:12:41.680
<v Speaker 3>he says so he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is his followup facebook post which</v>

272
00:12:41.681 --> 00:12:42.514
<v Speaker 3>you posted last Wednesday where he </v>
<v Speaker 3>begins by saying I'm my punishment the </v>

273
00:12:48.311 --> 00:12:49.144
<v Speaker 3>mob is howling for is now officially </v>
<v Speaker 3>more severe than the one for the actual </v>

274
00:12:51.761 --> 00:12:54.010
<v Speaker 3>ripest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is interesting.</v>

275
00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:55.323
<v Speaker 3>But towards the end he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't yell at victims to go to the </v>

276
00:12:58.091 --> 00:12:59.230
<v Speaker 3>police.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are victims.</v>

277
00:12:59.231 --> 00:13:01.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm yelling at the people who said women</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't go to the police.</v>

278
00:13:01.901 --> 00:13:05.530
<v Speaker 3>They have to work outside the system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's out of bullshit and leads</v>

279
00:13:05.531 --> 00:13:08.980
<v Speaker 3>to rapists walking free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It hurts the victims of sexual assault.</v>

280
00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.073
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's saying that because this woman </v>

281
00:13:10.831 --> 00:13:14.160
<v Speaker 4>never went to the police.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's just publicly accused of rape.</v>

282
00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:16.460
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't there more than one woman as well?</v>

283
00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:19.100
<v Speaker 3>I believe so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe there's a second one.</v>

284
00:13:19.101 --> 00:13:20.600
<v Speaker 3>Who's friends with that girl?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

285
00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.200
<v Speaker 3>Who also says the same store.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he ain't good.</v>

286
00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:26.870
<v Speaker 3>He claims to be on the side of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>victims.</v>

287
00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:27.723
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he just doesn't quite get how </v>

288
00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:30.703
<v Speaker 3>traumatic it can be for people who've </v>
<v Speaker 3>been for women who've been sexually </v>

289
00:13:32.931 --> 00:13:34.340
<v Speaker 3>assaulted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He gets raped every day.</v>

290
00:13:34.341 --> 00:13:35.174
<v Speaker 3>You don't even know.</v>

291
00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:37.840
<v Speaker 4>You don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He gets raped every day,</v>

292
00:13:37.841 --> 00:13:39.520
<v Speaker 4>just so you can understand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It gets raped every day.</v>

293
00:13:39.521 --> 00:13:41.290
<v Speaker 4>He loves it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not Funny.</v>

294
00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:42.820
<v Speaker 4>Rape is never funny.</v>

295
00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:43.943
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

296
00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:45.190
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>

297
00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:46.053
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why did the story of what actually </v>

298
00:13:46.841 --> 00:13:47.674
<v Speaker 3>happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happened to come out after the guy </v>

299
00:13:49.021 --> 00:13:52.120
<v Speaker 3>is declared a ripest?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll listen to any victim's account.</v>

300
00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:56.400
<v Speaker 3>All that was given initially is Aaron's </v>
<v Speaker 3>right best pass it on.</v>

301
00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:58.780
<v Speaker 3>My point was that no one seems disturbed</v>
<v Speaker 3>by this.</v>

302
00:13:58.781 --> 00:14:01.390
<v Speaker 3>No one sees that down the road.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Next time we might get it wrong.</v>

303
00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:04.270
<v Speaker 4>Well we might have it wrong here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't know,</v>

304
00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:08.350
<v Speaker 4>but it's not good when a second person </v>
<v Speaker 4>calls you out for the same crime.</v>

305
00:14:08.351 --> 00:14:09.184
<v Speaker 4>That's right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's also not good that no one went </v>

306
00:14:10.931 --> 00:14:14.950
<v Speaker 4>to the cops and maybe also what kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>evidence do you have?</v>

307
00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:17.110
<v Speaker 4>Somebody raped you a month ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>guess what?</v>

308
00:14:17.111 --> 00:14:18.070
<v Speaker 4>You have no evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

309
00:14:18.071 --> 00:14:19.810
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As you've showered up and you don't have</v>

310
00:14:19.811 --> 00:14:21.400
<v Speaker 4>any bruises.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what can you say?</v>

311
00:14:21.401 --> 00:14:22.740
<v Speaker 4>It's your word against them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

312
00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:23.973
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think for some women and it's also </v>

313
00:14:26.021 --> 00:14:29.890
<v Speaker 4>like what exactly was the scenario that </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're talking about?</v>

314
00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:30.783
<v Speaker 4>Was it a simple social justice warrior </v>
<v Speaker 4>type thing where two people are drunk </v>

315
00:14:33.851 --> 00:14:36.310
<v Speaker 4>and then the woman didn't consent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they're calling that rape,</v>

316
00:14:36.311 --> 00:14:40.750
<v Speaker 4>which is repeated ad nauseum and it got </v>
<v Speaker 4>kicked out at Occidental.</v>

317
00:14:40.751 --> 00:14:42.880
<v Speaker 4>College is a lawsuit going on right now </v>
<v Speaker 4>because of that.</v>

318
00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:45.640
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure you know that story where a man</v>
<v Speaker 4>and a woman,</v>

319
00:14:45.641 --> 00:14:46.900
<v Speaker 4>the girl was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>coming over,</v>

320
00:14:46.901 --> 00:14:49.330
<v Speaker 4>do you have condoms?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have sex,</v>

321
00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.610
<v Speaker 4>and then her friends convinced her that </v>
<v Speaker 4>because she was drunk,</v>

322
00:14:52.611 --> 00:14:53.444
<v Speaker 4>it was rape even though they were both </v>
<v Speaker 4>drunk and then the college kicks him </v>

323
00:14:57.471 --> 00:14:59.390
<v Speaker 4>out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>keeps her and so he's suing the college.</v>

324
00:14:59.391 --> 00:15:01.790
<v Speaker 4>It's a fucking giant disaster is total </v>
<v Speaker 4>sexism.</v>

325
00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:02.653
<v Speaker 4>One hundred percent sexism against the </v>
<v Speaker 4>man and when you look at the story and </v>

326
00:15:06.441 --> 00:15:07.274
<v Speaker 4>what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a goddamn witch hunt and they gave </v>

327
00:15:08.481 --> 00:15:09.314
<v Speaker 4>into the witch hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just wanted to quiet it down and </v>

328
00:15:10.701 --> 00:15:11.534
<v Speaker 4>they figured it would be easier to kick </v>
<v Speaker 4>this kid out and and just given to the </v>

329
00:15:15.561 --> 00:15:16.760
<v Speaker 4>wills of the mom</v>

330
00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:18.770
<v Speaker 3>and then on the other hand you've got </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

331
00:15:18.771 --> 00:15:19.604
<v Speaker 3>like the the California College swimmer </v>
<v Speaker 3>kid who who raped a girl behind the </v>

332
00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:27.720
<v Speaker 3>dumpster on campus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've never heard about that.</v>

333
00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:29.603
<v Speaker 3>She was passed out and he was like </v>
<v Speaker 3>fingering her and she ended like pine </v>

334
00:15:31.521 --> 00:15:34.550
<v Speaker 3>cone cuts all over her vagina and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything was really horrible story and</v>

335
00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:36.200
<v Speaker 3>she ended up getting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

336
00:15:36.201 --> 00:15:38.960
<v Speaker 3>six months basically nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and now he's out.</v>

337
00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:41.200
<v Speaker 3>Now he's out again and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and</v>

338
00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:42.430
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

339
00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:45.230
<v Speaker 4>that's a fucking terrible person and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that guy should be</v>

340
00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:46.930
<v Speaker 3>punished.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the judge was,</v>

341
00:15:46.931 --> 00:15:49.600
<v Speaker 3>the judge was an alum of the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>college and so and so.</v>

342
00:15:49.601 --> 00:15:50.830
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an all boys school.</v>

343
00:15:50.831 --> 00:15:51.341
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

344
00:15:51.341 --> 00:15:53.060
<v Speaker 3>well boys will be boys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>

345
00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:57.420
<v Speaker 3>and the apology that this rice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ripest little asshole road was like,</v>

346
00:15:57.700 --> 00:15:58.533
<v Speaker 3>I think this serves as a good lesson </v>
<v Speaker 3>about intoxication and the dangers of </v>

347
00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.480
<v Speaker 3>inebriation on campus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

348
00:16:04.481 --> 00:16:05.260
<v Speaker 3>fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't,</v>

349
00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:06.550
<v Speaker 3>that's not the lesson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The lesson is done,</v>

350
00:16:06.551 --> 00:16:07.384
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Paypal,</v>

351
00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:10.810
<v Speaker 3>when she's in colons and someone's </v>
<v Speaker 3>vagina piece of shit.</v>

352
00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:11.141
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

353
00:16:11.141 --> 00:16:14.050
<v Speaker 3>when she was ending,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was bad enough to people who say,</v>

354
00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:16.750
<v Speaker 3>well maybe he thought that she was </v>
<v Speaker 3>consenting.</v>

355
00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:19.210
<v Speaker 3>It was obvious enough that to other </v>
<v Speaker 3>students,</v>

356
00:16:19.211 --> 00:16:21.700
<v Speaker 3>they were foreign students.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were Swedish guys were riding by on</v>

357
00:16:21.701 --> 00:16:24.850
<v Speaker 3>bicycles and they saw what was going on </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was obvious from afar,</v>

358
00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:25.713
<v Speaker 3>even in the dark what was happening </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they stopped and came over and </v>

359
00:16:27.881 --> 00:16:29.220
<v Speaker 3>rescued her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was limp as a,</v>

360
00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:30.423
<v Speaker 3>as a ragdoll.</v>

361
00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:33.150
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's that.</v>

362
00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:38.100
<v Speaker 4>That's real rape and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's terrifying when a woman does get,</v>

363
00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:39.373
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exposed as being someone who's </v>

364
00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:41.600
<v Speaker 4>experienced rape.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the,</v>

365
00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:42.453
<v Speaker 4>you have to think about all these people</v>
<v Speaker 4>that know your personal trauma and then </v>

366
00:16:45.541 --> 00:16:48.180
<v Speaker 4>this guy barely gets punished.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's horrible too.</v>

367
00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:49.230
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's horrible too.</v>

368
00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:50.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

369
00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:52.320
<v Speaker 4>It sucks both ways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

370
00:16:52.321 --> 00:16:54.570
<v Speaker 4>I guess it's definitely sucks worse if </v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

371
00:16:54.571 --> 00:16:57.810
<v Speaker 4>the person who gets victimized,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it still sucks if you're someone who</v>

372
00:16:57.811 --> 00:17:02.490
<v Speaker 4>didn't do anything wrong and someone </v>
<v Speaker 4>claims that you're a rapist and that tag</v>

373
00:17:02.491 --> 00:17:05.430
<v Speaker 4>carries you for the rest of your life </v>
<v Speaker 4>and in your being falsely accused.</v>

374
00:17:05.431 --> 00:17:08.340
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Until we can read people's minds clearly</v>

375
00:17:08.370 --> 00:17:09.300
<v Speaker 4>and truly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>

376
00:17:09.301 --> 00:17:10.890
<v Speaker 4>that'll be terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going to happen.</v>

377
00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:12.570
<v Speaker 4>It's on the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

378
00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:16.440
<v Speaker 4>it's like right now we are at the Morse </v>
<v Speaker 4>code of reading minds.</v>

379
00:17:16.830 --> 00:17:17.780
<v Speaker 4>We're at the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

380
00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:18.121
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

381
00:17:18.121 --> 00:17:18.791
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to do,</v>

382
00:17:18.791 --> 00:17:19.321
<v Speaker 4>do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do,</v>

383
00:17:19.321 --> 00:17:19.680
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>

384
00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:21.840
<v Speaker 4>That's where we're at.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they're sending signals,</v>

385
00:17:22.090 --> 00:17:24.990
<v Speaker 4>they're receiving signals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're articulating words,</v>

386
00:17:24.991 --> 00:17:25.824
<v Speaker 4>someone sending their setting words </v>
<v Speaker 4>through the Internet into your mind and </v>

387
00:17:28.441 --> 00:17:29.970
<v Speaker 4>you see those words.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You hear those words,</v>

388
00:17:29.971 --> 00:17:32.520
<v Speaker 4>images,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can place images in your mind.</v>

389
00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:33.683
<v Speaker 4>This is a very rudimentary right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're gonna be able to string </v>

390
00:17:36.331 --> 00:17:40.320
<v Speaker 4>those words together and form sentences </v>
<v Speaker 4>and those words instead of being through</v>

391
00:17:40.321 --> 00:17:41.154
<v Speaker 4>some giant Bank of supercomputers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be something that's in </v>

392
00:17:44.131 --> 00:17:44.964
<v Speaker 4>your phone or a chip that we all </v>
<v Speaker 4>willingly installing our brains and </v>

393
00:17:48.391 --> 00:17:50.640
<v Speaker 4>we're going to read each other's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then we're going to know.</v>

394
00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:54.410
<v Speaker 3>I wonder how nuanced that'll be though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I did a,</v>

395
00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:57.080
<v Speaker 3>I did a story before I was at huffpost </v>
<v Speaker 3>live.</v>

396
00:17:57.081 --> 00:17:58.640
<v Speaker 3>I had a show on discovery science </v>
<v Speaker 3>channel,</v>

397
00:17:58.641 --> 00:18:00.980
<v Speaker 3>which was sort of a bit like the soup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We like a smart ass.</v>

398
00:18:00.981 --> 00:18:05.600
<v Speaker 3>He kind of look at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but science nerd news and I went to come</v>

399
00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:07.160
<v Speaker 3>and where it was somewhere up in the bay</v>
<v Speaker 3>area,</v>

400
00:18:07.161 --> 00:18:12.110
<v Speaker 3>so some it place where they working on </v>
<v Speaker 3>mind reading a computer games.</v>

401
00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:15.770
<v Speaker 3>And this was all the way back in I guess</v>
<v Speaker 3>2010,</v>

402
00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:16.663
<v Speaker 3>2009 and I you could put a thing on your</v>
<v Speaker 3>head and you can operate the computer </v>

403
00:18:20.721 --> 00:18:22.350
<v Speaker 3>game just through the intensity of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>pet,</v>

404
00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:23.810
<v Speaker 3>of your thought patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very,</v>

405
00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:25.160
<v Speaker 3>like you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's basically Morse code.</v>

406
00:18:25.161 --> 00:18:25.994
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty much only on or off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't just know nuance apart from </v>

407
00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:31.310
<v Speaker 3>just think hard about something and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

408
00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:34.340
<v Speaker 3>you'll set fire to this little thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you need to set fire to,</v>

409
00:18:34.341 --> 00:18:37.460
<v Speaker 3>to win the game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing that they can tell that.</v>

410
00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:40.730
<v Speaker 3>But I wonder whether or not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And for example,</v>

411
00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:43.760
<v Speaker 3>we can see the brain when you put people</v>
<v Speaker 3>in an Mri machine,</v>

412
00:18:43.761 --> 00:18:46.720
<v Speaker 3>we can tell whether or not the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the room,</v>

413
00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:47.653
<v Speaker 3>the memory part of your brain is </v>
<v Speaker 3>lighting up when they show you </v>

414
00:18:49.581 --> 00:18:51.710
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they talking about the possibility of</v>

415
00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:52.983
<v Speaker 3>in a criminal trial,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd be able to at least be able to </v>

416
00:18:55.101 --> 00:18:57.500
<v Speaker 3>tell whether or not you've ever been to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the inside,</v>

417
00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:58.873
<v Speaker 3>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the of the place where the crime was </v>

418
00:19:00.531 --> 00:19:01.000
<v Speaker 3>committed.</v>

419
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:01.421
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

420
00:19:01.421 --> 00:19:04.270
<v Speaker 4>I did an episode of this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of that drug and questions,</v>

421
00:19:04.271 --> 00:19:06.250
<v Speaker 4>everything with Mri.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They actually,</v>

422
00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:09.700
<v Speaker 4>they accused someone and convicted </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone,</v>

423
00:19:09.701 --> 00:19:10.534
<v Speaker 4>I believe in India of having functional </v>
<v Speaker 4>knowledge of a crime scene because </v>

424
00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:16.023
<v Speaker 4>through f Mri they were able to indicate</v>
<v Speaker 4>that she understood where that crime </v>

425
00:19:19.691 --> 00:19:20.524
<v Speaker 4>scene was and she had some form of </v>
<v Speaker 4>memory that they could deduce from the </v>

426
00:19:22.961 --> 00:19:25.990
<v Speaker 4>Fmr.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The problem according to neuroscientists</v>

427
00:19:25.991 --> 00:19:28.600
<v Speaker 4>and the woman I was talking to on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>podcast on the show,</v>

428
00:19:28.601 --> 00:19:30.670
<v Speaker 4>I forget her name,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I apologized to her,</v>

429
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:31.833
<v Speaker 4>but she explained that the problem is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that during the course of the </v>

430
00:19:33.911 --> 00:19:34.744
<v Speaker 4>investigation that person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the woman who was accused and convicted </v>

431
00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:39.033
<v Speaker 4>could have been exposed to the evidence </v>
<v Speaker 4>of that crime scene and then have </v>

432
00:19:42.431 --> 00:19:46.150
<v Speaker 4>functional memory of that crime scene.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because of that which was exposed during</v>

433
00:19:46.151 --> 00:19:46.984
<v Speaker 4>the MRI.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Particularly when you think about the </v>

434
00:19:49.361 --> 00:19:50.194
<v Speaker 4>fact that her freedom was on the line,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she was falsely accused or accused of </v>

435
00:19:53.471 --> 00:19:54.910
<v Speaker 4>this crime.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if she did or not.</v>

436
00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:57.460
<v Speaker 4>She's accused of this crime they </v>
<v Speaker 4>presented with this evidence.</v>

437
00:19:57.461 --> 00:19:58.294
<v Speaker 4>She has to go over this evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's an incredible amount of weight </v>

438
00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:01.173
<v Speaker 4>in emotions involved in that and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>could see or that memory deeply in her </v>

439
00:20:04.481 --> 00:20:06.310
<v Speaker 4>brain of what that scene looked like.</v>

440
00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:08.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's interesting.</v>

441
00:20:08.041 --> 00:20:08.874
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember whether you've told me </v>
<v Speaker 3>about that or whether I've just heard </v>

442
00:20:10.501 --> 00:20:12.000
<v Speaker 3>you talk about it on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the podcast,</v>

443
00:20:12.001 --> 00:20:12.834
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then as you get to more and more </v>

444
00:20:13.861 --> 00:20:14.694
<v Speaker 3>subtle layers of thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's not just is the memory part of </v>

445
00:20:18.841 --> 00:20:22.020
<v Speaker 3>the brain firing when we showed this </v>
<v Speaker 3>person an image of something,</v>

446
00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:24.360
<v Speaker 3>but it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

447
00:20:24.361 --> 00:20:28.290
<v Speaker 3>how would you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How would you ascertain somebody's guilt</v>

448
00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:30.990
<v Speaker 3>or innocence in a rape case?</v>

449
00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:32.990
<v Speaker 4>Right now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't see.</v>

450
00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:35.960
<v Speaker 4>I think what they're doing with this </v>
<v Speaker 4>Fmri stuff is.</v>

451
00:20:35.961 --> 00:20:38.660
<v Speaker 4>I mean obviously you can't if there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>some significant evidence,</v>

452
00:20:38.661 --> 00:20:41.420
<v Speaker 4>Siemens scratches video actually by </v>
<v Speaker 4>reading your mind,</v>

453
00:20:41.421 --> 00:20:44.810
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think that Kenya,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what they were saying is that the.</v>

454
00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:47.620
<v Speaker 4>What they did in India with this woman </v>
<v Speaker 4>was telling me she,</v>

455
00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:48.220
<v Speaker 4>and she</v>

456
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:49.840
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a prominent neuroscientist.</v>

457
00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:53.500
<v Speaker 2>She was saying that they misuse the </v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence.</v>

458
00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:54.633
<v Speaker 2>They misstated the efficacy of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence and that they use this in a </v>

459
00:20:58.031 --> 00:20:58.864
<v Speaker 2>very inappropriate way that would not be</v>
<v Speaker 2>legal in the United States like you </v>

460
00:21:01.151 --> 00:21:02.920
<v Speaker 2>would get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one who understands,</v>

461
00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:03.933
<v Speaker 2>truly understands Fmr,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who would sign off on that or no one </v>

462
00:21:06.671 --> 00:21:07.504
<v Speaker 2>whose ethical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean from the neuroscientist who I've </v>

463
00:21:08.621 --> 00:21:10.180
<v Speaker 2>spoken to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're a long,</v>

464
00:21:10.181 --> 00:21:11.014
<v Speaker 2>long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>long way away from having the kind of </v>

465
00:21:13.031 --> 00:21:16.780
<v Speaker 2>granularity and confidence that we could</v>
<v Speaker 2>say just because this part of the law,</v>

466
00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:20.680
<v Speaker 2>the brain is lighting up or was it just </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of these kinds of waves of being</v>

467
00:21:20.681 --> 00:21:21.514
<v Speaker 2>emitted by your neurons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means that you're either guilty or </v>

468
00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:26.680
<v Speaker 2>not guilty according to our standard </v>
<v Speaker 2>biology.</v>

469
00:21:26.681 --> 00:21:28.750
<v Speaker 2>I would agree with that and here's where</v>
<v Speaker 2>I deviate.</v>

470
00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:30.093
<v Speaker 2>I think that we are not that far away </v>
<v Speaker 2>from them being able to introduce </v>

471
00:21:33.401 --> 00:21:34.234
<v Speaker 2>artificial recording of memories and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think that people are going to do it </v>

472
00:21:37.361 --> 00:21:38.194
<v Speaker 2>willingly and I think it's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of those things that people share </v>

473
00:21:40.031 --> 00:21:41.290
<v Speaker 2>with each other back and forth.</v>

474
00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:42.190
<v Speaker 2>What are you showing me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie?</v>

475
00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:46.370
<v Speaker 2>Scientists discover how to implant false</v>
<v Speaker 2>memories pulley Ah,</v>

476
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.190
<v Speaker 2>shame.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just blew it up.</v>

477
00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:49.690
<v Speaker 2>So what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pull it up.</v>

478
00:21:49.691 --> 00:21:52.570
<v Speaker 2>Mit researchers expand that so I could </v>
<v Speaker 2>read that a little bit better.</v>

479
00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:55.780
<v Speaker 2>MIT researchers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Steve Ramirez and wow.</v>

480
00:21:56.150 --> 00:21:56.983
<v Speaker 2>The Zulu recently made history when they</v>
<v Speaker 2>successfully implanted a false memory </v>

481
00:22:01.661 --> 00:22:05.230
<v Speaker 2>into the mind of a mouse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The proof was a simple reaction from the</v>

482
00:22:05.231 --> 00:22:07.270
<v Speaker 2>road and what the implications are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vast,</v>

483
00:22:07.271 --> 00:22:10.390
<v Speaker 2>they placed the furry little creature </v>
<v Speaker 2>inside a metal box and it froze.</v>

484
00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:11.373
<v Speaker 2>Displaying a distinct fear response.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The mouse is reacting as if they </v>

485
00:22:14.131 --> 00:22:16.630
<v Speaker 2>received a wreck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Electrical shock there when it had it at</v>

486
00:22:16.631 --> 00:22:17.464
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

487
00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:18.393
<v Speaker 2>I'm stable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not surprised and this is what I </v>

488
00:22:20.651 --> 00:22:21.484
<v Speaker 2>think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been really heavily dabbling in </v>

489
00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:30.050
<v Speaker 2>virtual reality lately because my friend</v>
<v Speaker 2>Duncan has the htc vive and uh,</v>

490
00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:30.933
<v Speaker 2>he put it on me and I went into a frenzy</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I realized like what is happening </v>

491
00:22:34.931 --> 00:22:35.764
<v Speaker 2>and where we're at and where I thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>we were at versus where we actually are </v>

492
00:22:38.111 --> 00:22:38.920
<v Speaker 2>at.</v>

493
00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:41.710
<v Speaker 2>They are so far ahead of where I thought</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are.</v>

494
00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:46.110
<v Speaker 2>They are so close to creating a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

495
00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:49.690
<v Speaker 2>an indiscernible virtual reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so close.</v>

496
00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:53.130
<v Speaker 2>Kind of do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a friend of mine works us up at a,</v>

497
00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:54.340
<v Speaker 2>but what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who owns oculus?</v>

498
00:22:54.341 --> 00:22:55.510
<v Speaker 2>Facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the big,</v>

499
00:22:55.511 --> 00:22:56.344
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>virtual reality of either Google or </v>

500
00:22:57.281 --> 00:22:58.220
<v Speaker 2>facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

501
00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:00.370
<v Speaker 2>Facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Facebook tarmac is coming in here.</v>

502
00:23:00.371 --> 00:23:01.204
<v Speaker 2>John Carmack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the girl from ID software who </v>

503
00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:03.603
<v Speaker 2>programmed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He created doom and quake and all those </v>

504
00:23:05.531 --> 00:23:06.790
<v Speaker 2>games.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's now at Oculus,</v>

505
00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:07.900
<v Speaker 2>which is just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

506
00:23:07.901 --> 00:23:10.130
<v Speaker 2>he's a flesh and go up there to try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

507
00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:11.033
<v Speaker 2>I was hearing Tim Ferriss talks about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this as well and just say a Dunkin </v>

508
00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:13.953
<v Speaker 2>donuts podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I connect you guys in town for a til </v>

509
00:23:17.141 --> 00:23:18.010
<v Speaker 2>Saturday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

510
00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:21.280
<v Speaker 2>I'll connect you guys when we get after </v>
<v Speaker 2>this show and I think Duncanson town.</v>

511
00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:23.110
<v Speaker 2>Fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to shit your pants.</v>

512
00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:26.350
<v Speaker 2>This shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's amazing.</v>

513
00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:27.483
<v Speaker 2>But what's amazing about it is right now</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's goggles and it's connected to a </v>

514
00:23:30.641 --> 00:23:33.680
<v Speaker 2>computer and it's clunky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

515
00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:34.653
<v Speaker 2>the original computers at the Apollo </v>
<v Speaker 2>mission used were giant room and one </v>

516
00:23:40.061 --> 00:23:42.150
<v Speaker 2>quarter of the processing power or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something of your life.</v>

517
00:23:42.151 --> 00:23:43.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't even think it's one quarter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

518
00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:46.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's the point is that as you,</v>

519
00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:46.993
<v Speaker 4>as this technology exponentially gets </v>
<v Speaker 4>more and more powerful and smaller and </v>

520
00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:54.830
<v Speaker 4>more easy for people to access,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

521
00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:55.673
<v Speaker 4>used to be everyone remember Wall Street</v>
<v Speaker 4>when Michael Douglas had that giant </v>

522
00:23:58.461 --> 00:24:00.220
<v Speaker 4>brick phone and we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what a gangster.</v>

523
00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:03.530
<v Speaker 4>I'm walking around with that phone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that phone's job and now,</v>

524
00:24:03.531 --> 00:24:08.210
<v Speaker 4>I mean that was in Brazil a few years </v>
<v Speaker 4>back in 2003 and uh,</v>

525
00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:09.283
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you go to these like little tiny jungle </v>

526
00:24:10.521 --> 00:24:13.340
<v Speaker 4>villages and all these people have cell </v>
<v Speaker 4>phones.</v>

527
00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:14.630
<v Speaker 4>Everybody has a phone.</v>

528
00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:15.713
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be incredible as you see </v>

529
00:24:16.531 --> 00:24:17.221
<v Speaker 3>how.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

530
00:24:17.221 --> 00:24:21.380
<v Speaker 3>the interesting thing for me in via are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is what we're saying is where it's gonna</v>

531
00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:22.223
<v Speaker 3>go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So everything moves so fast now that </v>

532
00:24:24.091 --> 00:24:26.580
<v Speaker 3>it's incredible for me to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love,</v>

533
00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:29.160
<v Speaker 3>I love human ignorance as well as </v>
<v Speaker 3>genius.</v>

534
00:24:29.161 --> 00:24:29.994
<v Speaker 3>Like I love my own inability to predict </v>
<v Speaker 3>how things are going to unfold and just </v>

535
00:24:33.421 --> 00:24:34.500
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sheer,</v>

536
00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:38.840
<v Speaker 3>the sheer joy in how spontaneously kind </v>
<v Speaker 3>of a,</v>

537
00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:39.833
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exciting that this whole human </v>

538
00:24:41.071 --> 00:24:45.360
<v Speaker 3>experiment is because when for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>huffpost live,</v>

539
00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:48.300
<v Speaker 3>we started doing this thing in 2012.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were like,</v>

540
00:24:48.301 --> 00:24:49.134
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well let's do the future of television </v>

541
00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:53.880
<v Speaker 3>because obviously television and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Internet are coming together and they're</v>

542
00:24:53.881 --> 00:24:55.470
<v Speaker 3>going to merge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the way that we.</v>

543
00:24:55.471 --> 00:24:56.304
<v Speaker 3>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you were starting from scratch and </v>

544
00:24:57.481 --> 00:24:58.314
<v Speaker 3>inventing a tool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a television talk show now knowing </v>

545
00:25:00.871 --> 00:25:03.960
<v Speaker 3>nothing about the history of </v>
<v Speaker 3>broadcasting or television or radio,</v>

546
00:25:04.290 --> 00:25:05.160
<v Speaker 3>what would it be like?</v>

547
00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:06.970
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'd be didn't have commenters and you'd</v>

548
00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:07.823
<v Speaker 3>have people joining via Webcam and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>they developed like 12 hours a day of </v>

549
00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:13.103
<v Speaker 3>huffpost live broadcasts from studios.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Within a few years it was clear that </v>

550
00:25:16.531 --> 00:25:18.180
<v Speaker 3>that was obsolete.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was not the way that the future was</v>

551
00:25:18.181 --> 00:25:21.330
<v Speaker 3>going and now it's all like short live </v>
<v Speaker 3>streaming,</v>

552
00:25:21.331 --> 00:25:23.120
<v Speaker 3>shareable things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

553
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:29.000
<v Speaker 3>Similarly with virtual reality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the Fio was and has been.</v>

554
00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:32.220
<v Speaker 3>When it gets really good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone's just to sit in their basement</v>

555
00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:33.083
<v Speaker 3>and watch virtual reality porn all day </v>
<v Speaker 3>and no one's going to connect with each </v>

556
00:25:36.601 --> 00:25:37.530
<v Speaker 3>other anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

557
00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:39.510
<v Speaker 3>It's coming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he is.</v>

558
00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:40.703
<v Speaker 3>What's the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the biggest virtual or augmented </v>

559
00:25:42.901 --> 00:25:47.430
<v Speaker 3>reality breakthrough thus far?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's widespread.</v>

560
00:25:47.431 --> 00:25:50.400
<v Speaker 3>That's caught on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what his pokemon go.</v>

561
00:25:51.390 --> 00:25:53.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's dropped off significantly.</v>

562
00:25:53.131 --> 00:25:54.270
<v Speaker 3>Do you know that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

563
00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:57.690
<v Speaker 3>They're dropped into my users over the </v>
<v Speaker 3>last week.</v>

564
00:25:57.810 --> 00:25:59.400
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know it was that much,</v>

565
00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:00.653
<v Speaker 3>but here's the thing.</v>

566
00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:02.430
<v Speaker 3>I was pretty sure against it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's in Thai.</v>

567
00:26:02.790 --> 00:26:03.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I.</v>

568
00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:05.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that it's going to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The pokemon go itself is going to change</v>

569
00:26:05.911 --> 00:26:06.744
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What points to to me is the possibility </v>

570
00:26:09.511 --> 00:26:10.344
<v Speaker 3>that where we thought that virtual </v>
<v Speaker 3>reality was all going to be about </v>

571
00:26:13.021 --> 00:26:17.040
<v Speaker 3>headsets and me and my own head and </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it still will be to some extent.</v>

572
00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:19.073
<v Speaker 3>I could totally see it go in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>augmented reality way instead so that </v>

573
00:26:23.601 --> 00:26:25.800
<v Speaker 3>you're walking around the street with </v>
<v Speaker 3>some kind of little thing on the side of</v>

574
00:26:25.801 --> 00:26:26.634
<v Speaker 3>your head and all every way you look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things are popping up like little </v>

575
00:26:28.831 --> 00:26:30.330
<v Speaker 3>graphics are pumping up on top of </v>
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

576
00:26:30.331 --> 00:26:32.850
<v Speaker 3>offering you sales in a particular </v>
<v Speaker 3>store,</v>

577
00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:35.550
<v Speaker 3>showing you where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can say what you're looking for,</v>

578
00:26:35.551 --> 00:26:36.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where's the nearest bank and this little</v>

579
00:26:36.871 --> 00:26:39.480
<v Speaker 3>arrow that points down over the newest </v>
<v Speaker 3>chase branch or whatever.</v>

580
00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:41.300
<v Speaker 3>That's what magic leap is saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

581
00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:44.160
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So and that strikes</v>

582
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:48.600
<v Speaker 2>me is actually a more plausible and </v>
<v Speaker 2>organic pot old possible future than the</v>

583
00:26:48.601 --> 00:26:51.930
<v Speaker 2>one in which we're all just sort of like</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the wally,</v>

584
00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:56.040
<v Speaker 2>remember the movie Wally Universe where </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're all just in Bocca lounges and lazy</v>

585
00:26:56.041 --> 00:26:56.874
<v Speaker 2>boys in kind of our own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they're mutually </v>

586
00:26:58.681 --> 00:27:00.270
<v Speaker 2>exclusive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe not.</v>

587
00:27:00.271 --> 00:27:03.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's either or.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's going to happen as well.</v>

588
00:27:03.091 --> 00:27:06.900
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be brave fools that </v>
<v Speaker 2>venture outside and experience augmented</v>

589
00:27:06.901 --> 00:27:10.290
<v Speaker 2>reality where everybody else stairs at </v>
<v Speaker 2>people's buttholes from two inches away.</v>

590
00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:11.371
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

591
00:27:11.371 --> 00:27:15.480
<v Speaker 2>you put on these virtual goggles and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a three d porn going on where these</v>

592
00:27:15.481 --> 00:27:17.400
<v Speaker 2>people are having sex and you can get </v>
<v Speaker 2>right in there.</v>

593
00:27:17.401 --> 00:27:18.234
<v Speaker 2>You could look at their face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could stare in their eyes when they </v>

594
00:27:19.981 --> 00:27:20.814
<v Speaker 2>have sex and it looks so God damn real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but their computer generated avatars or </v>

595
00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:26.580
<v Speaker 2>they feel human being filmed.</v>

596
00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:30.290
<v Speaker 2>Human beings for 360 degree cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And right now it's,</v>

597
00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:31.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fairly limited.</v>

598
00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:33.450
<v Speaker 2>Did you watch porn on it now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't.</v>

599
00:27:33.451 --> 00:27:35.580
<v Speaker 2>Duncan has though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dunkin is into it.</v>

600
00:27:35.581 --> 00:27:37.060
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to watch porn in front of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dunkin.</v>

601
00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:40.560
<v Speaker 2>Can't see anything other than the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just kidding.</v>

602
00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:44.490
<v Speaker 2>But it's when you feel someone blowing </v>
<v Speaker 2>you and you're just like,</v>

603
00:27:44.491 --> 00:27:46.440
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>

604
00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:48.880
<v Speaker 2>Beard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Play enough.</v>

605
00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:50.340
<v Speaker 2>Duncan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

606
00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:51.600
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

607
00:27:51.810 --> 00:27:55.770
<v Speaker 2>I saw the um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most impressive thing that I saw was</v>

608
00:27:55.771 --> 00:27:56.604
<v Speaker 2>the underwater thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have this underwater thing where </v>

609
00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:00.313
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're standing at the bottom of the </v>

610
00:28:01.531 --> 00:28:04.890
<v Speaker 2>ocean and these fish swim by and then a </v>
<v Speaker 2>whale swims up to you and you're looking</v>

611
00:28:04.891 --> 00:28:08.790
<v Speaker 2>the whale in the eye and it has this </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling of mass,</v>

612
00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:11.320
<v Speaker 2>like you really feel like there's whales</v>
<v Speaker 2>in front of you.</v>

613
00:28:11.321 --> 00:28:12.240
<v Speaker 2>You freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

614
00:28:12.241 --> 00:28:13.350
<v Speaker 2>it's so realistic.</v>

615
00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:14.880
<v Speaker 2>It's actual three d footage of A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

616
00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:15.680
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

617
00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:18.210
<v Speaker 2>it's CCGI generated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

618
00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:20.700
<v Speaker 2>but it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing and it's just.</v>

619
00:28:20.701 --> 00:28:21.960
<v Speaker 2>It gives you this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

620
00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:25.950
<v Speaker 2>I first tried virtual reality at </v>
<v Speaker 2>Duncan's place,</v>

621
00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:29.130
<v Speaker 2>I want to say four years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three years ago,</v>

622
00:28:29.131 --> 00:28:32.520
<v Speaker 2>somewhere in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was really crude.</v>

623
00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:36.630
<v Speaker 2>It was pixelated and it was some silly </v>
<v Speaker 2>game and it was really clunky,</v>

624
00:28:36.631 --> 00:28:38.910
<v Speaker 2>but I could see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could see it.</v>

625
00:28:38.911 --> 00:28:39.721
<v Speaker 2>I could go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

626
00:28:39.721 --> 00:28:41.220
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see where this is going.</v>

627
00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:42.533
<v Speaker 2>This is just leaps and bounds past where</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is and there's one game that you </v>

628
00:28:46.501 --> 00:28:47.334
<v Speaker 2>play or one experience that you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you go into this guys room and </v>

629
00:28:51.151 --> 00:28:55.380
<v Speaker 2>he's composing music on a piano and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>walk in the room and you can look up and</v>

630
00:28:55.381 --> 00:28:58.620
<v Speaker 2>look around and while this guy's playing</v>
<v Speaker 2>the piano,</v>

631
00:28:58.621 --> 00:29:00.690
<v Speaker 2>you can get up beside him and look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>his keys.</v>

632
00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:03.420
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's video.</v>

633
00:29:03.421 --> 00:29:05.910
<v Speaker 2>That's a real guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Apparently Duncan says like,</v>

634
00:29:05.911 --> 00:29:07.650
<v Speaker 2>the porn is just like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can just like get.</v>

635
00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:12.420
<v Speaker 2>So I mean for me the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think fundamentally we are.</v>

636
00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:14.730
<v Speaker 2>Oh well he's the image of the whale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

637
00:29:14.731 --> 00:29:19.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is not doing it justice </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you don't have a real reality.</v>

638
00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:20.113
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't have any control whether </v>

639
00:29:20.731 --> 00:29:21.564
<v Speaker 2>or not you move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're kind of getting a sense of </v>

640
00:29:23.551 --> 00:29:25.800
<v Speaker 2>what happens while love this camera </v>
<v Speaker 2>moves around,</v>

641
00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:27.570
<v Speaker 2>but I'm a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can get underneath that.</v>

642
00:29:27.571 --> 00:29:31.020
<v Speaker 2>We'll look at its body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd gone onto the water with a,</v>

643
00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:34.050
<v Speaker 2>with a humpback whale and mainly a </v>
<v Speaker 2>couple of years ago.</v>

644
00:29:34.051 --> 00:29:34.884
<v Speaker 2>You're not allowed to swim with them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you're in a little dodgy Zodiac </v>

645
00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:40.110
<v Speaker 2>like I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they get around the rules.</v>

646
00:29:40.111 --> 00:29:42.190
<v Speaker 2>Well my guy did by just holding</v>

647
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:43.023
<v Speaker 3>your legs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so as long as you're still connected to </v>

648
00:29:44.681 --> 00:29:46.510
<v Speaker 3>the boat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you're technically not swimming,</v>

649
00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:50.320
<v Speaker 3>swim with them because it for </v>
<v Speaker 3>environmental reasons,</v>

650
00:29:50.321 --> 00:29:51.154
<v Speaker 3>like people were Dick heads would go up </v>
<v Speaker 3>and harass them for the team and the </v>

651
00:29:53.471 --> 00:29:54.640
<v Speaker 3>whale or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

652
00:29:54.650 --> 00:29:55.483
<v Speaker 3>You need to give them their space and so</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a snorkel on and goggles on and </v>

653
00:29:59.861 --> 00:30:00.694
<v Speaker 3>this huge thing just comes looming out </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the ward and the size of a fucking </v>

654
00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:05.583
<v Speaker 3>bus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This memo that breathes air like that </v>

655
00:30:08.071 --> 00:30:08.904
<v Speaker 3>eats these times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the miracle of it blows my mind </v>

656
00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:13.953
<v Speaker 3>the diversity of this incredible planet </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we live on a and then it just sort </v>

657
00:30:19.301 --> 00:30:20.134
<v Speaker 3>of sinks down into the crystal blue </v>
<v Speaker 3>water until I can just sort of make it </v>

658
00:30:23.291 --> 00:30:26.170
<v Speaker 3>out and then it's just disappeared and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all just blue blue underneath.</v>

659
00:30:27.010 --> 00:30:30.040
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to sound too wacky,</v>

660
00:30:30.041 --> 00:30:31.030
<v Speaker 3>but it was spiritual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

661
00:30:31.031 --> 00:30:35.320
<v Speaker 3>you come over there and that thing is </v>
<v Speaker 3>just that was born,</v>

662
00:30:35.490 --> 00:30:36.323
<v Speaker 3>that squirted out of another whale's </v>
<v Speaker 3>vagina and then grew up and now it's </v>

663
00:30:39.191 --> 00:30:41.620
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now it's doing its thing in the Pacific</v>

664
00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:44.010
<v Speaker 4>paradigm shifting because of their </v>
<v Speaker 4>masks,</v>

665
00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:46.090
<v Speaker 4>because the oddness of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

666
00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:47.990
<v Speaker 4>even dolphins,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I um,</v>

667
00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:50.880
<v Speaker 4>did this thing last summer where,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

668
00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:51.753
<v Speaker 4>me and my whole family were in the big </v>
<v Speaker 4>island and you go on this dolphin </v>

669
00:30:55.961 --> 00:30:56.794
<v Speaker 4>excursion where they take you on a boat </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they find these pods of wild </v>

670
00:30:59.231 --> 00:31:03.730
<v Speaker 4>dolphins and you just jump into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>water with the dolphins with snorkels.</v>

671
00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:06.250
<v Speaker 4>So you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're swimming around and you know,</v>

672
00:31:06.251 --> 00:31:08.650
<v Speaker 4>I did it with my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the time she was five,</v>

673
00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:11.110
<v Speaker 4>we did it with my five year old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like holding her hand and taking her</v>

674
00:31:11.111 --> 00:31:14.260
<v Speaker 4>with these dolphins and we're looking </v>
<v Speaker 4>down with our goggles and these dolphins</v>

675
00:31:14.261 --> 00:31:15.910
<v Speaker 4>were swimming right under you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Amazing.</v>

676
00:31:15.911 --> 00:31:18.190
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's nuts.</v>

677
00:31:18.970 --> 00:31:23.970
<v Speaker 3>I was in the water and in Australia in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Byron Bay and was,</v>

678
00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:25.573
<v Speaker 3>and there are occasional shark attacks </v>
<v Speaker 3>there and caught a glimpse of movement </v>

679
00:31:29.651 --> 00:31:32.020
<v Speaker 3>out of the side of the side of my eye.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh fuck.</v>

680
00:31:32.050 --> 00:31:33.220
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh fuck.</v>

681
00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:37.980
<v Speaker 3>And looked over and could see like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>shape and a and a fin ps,</v>

682
00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:38.711
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

683
00:31:38.711 --> 00:31:39.544
<v Speaker 3>the water and then like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That moment where time stands stand </v>

684
00:31:42.010 --> 00:31:44.170
<v Speaker 3>still and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

685
00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:46.900
<v Speaker 3>And then the back just arched out of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>water.</v>

686
00:31:46.901 --> 00:31:47.560
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

687
00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:49.800
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thank fucking Lord you Dolphin.</v>

688
00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:52.810
<v Speaker 3>Oh fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh God.</v>

689
00:31:52.811 --> 00:31:55.390
<v Speaker 3>And then this whole pod of dolphins just</v>
<v Speaker 3>diving through the waves,</v>

690
00:31:55.391 --> 00:31:56.380
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God.</v>

691
00:31:56.770 --> 00:31:57.603
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a video off of Maui or excuse </v>

692
00:31:59.501 --> 00:32:00.334
<v Speaker 4>me off a Malibu really recently where </v>
<v Speaker 4>these people were flying a drone over a </v>

693
00:32:05.050 --> 00:32:05.883
<v Speaker 4>Malibu and he was only,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think maybe one or 200 yards </v>

694
00:32:09.371 --> 00:32:13.000
<v Speaker 4>away from swimmers and surfers and this </v>
<v Speaker 4>is fucking monster.</v>

695
00:32:13.001 --> 00:32:13.834
<v Speaker 4>Great White Shark swimming around it and</v>
<v Speaker 4>looking for something to chomp on and </v>

696
00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:18.573
<v Speaker 4>they're out there apparently like really</v>
<v Speaker 4>common off a Malibu and they're </v>

697
00:32:21.311 --> 00:32:24.880
<v Speaker 4>realizing that now because it drones </v>
<v Speaker 4>Herdez people fly those drones.</v>

698
00:32:24.881 --> 00:32:25.714
<v Speaker 4>And have you ever done those?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you found that operated at myself </v>

699
00:32:27.851 --> 00:32:29.420
<v Speaker 4>and that's another aspect of virtual </v>
<v Speaker 4>reality.</v>

700
00:32:29.421 --> 00:32:31.990
<v Speaker 4>It's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You put these virtual reality goggles on</v>

701
00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:36.070
<v Speaker 4>and you put a camera on this drone and </v>
<v Speaker 4>as the drone is flying,</v>

702
00:32:36.071 --> 00:32:39.980
<v Speaker 4>you feel like your.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did that in the Pacific when we</v>

703
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:44.600
<v Speaker 1>were looking for bigfoot Duncan and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>coincidentally,</v>

704
00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:45.550
<v Speaker 1>and this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

705
00:32:45.550 --> 00:32:48.440
<v Speaker 1>this drone is flying over the tree tops </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it really does.</v>

706
00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:49.303
<v Speaker 1>You have this sensation of flight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I want because I used to </v>

707
00:32:51.531 --> 00:32:53.630
<v Speaker 1>want to be a pilot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a huge aviation path.</v>

708
00:32:53.631 --> 00:32:55.700
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm part of the travel hacking </v>
<v Speaker 1>community,</v>

709
00:32:55.701 --> 00:32:56.534
<v Speaker 1>the bunch of nerds who figure out ways </v>
<v Speaker 1>to fly first class all over the place </v>

710
00:32:59.991 --> 00:33:00.824
<v Speaker 1>using credit card,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frequent flyer miles tracking travel </v>

711
00:33:04.191 --> 00:33:04.970
<v Speaker 1>hacking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

712
00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:05.751
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was real.</v>

713
00:33:05.751 --> 00:33:06.584
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's great.</v>

714
00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:07.453
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fly around the world first class at </v>

715
00:33:09.651 --> 00:33:10.484
<v Speaker 1>least two or three times a year as long </v>
<v Speaker 1>as there's many times I have time for </v>

716
00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:15.430
<v Speaker 1>one flights that would cost 20 or </v>
<v Speaker 1>$30,000.</v>

717
00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:19.240
<v Speaker 1>Mean flight from here to Australia in </v>
<v Speaker 1>first class on a good airline is $22.</v>

718
00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:20.870
<v Speaker 1>Twenty two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>$23,000.</v>

719
00:33:21.130 --> 00:33:23.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just use points these miles.</v>

720
00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:26.180
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm a huge.</v>

721
00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:27.950
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look like,</v>

722
00:33:27.951 --> 00:33:29.450
<v Speaker 1>you think that I'm committing crime?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

723
00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:34.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm not your own little insecurities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know.</v>

724
00:33:35.410 --> 00:33:38.590
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I've been saying that in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>interaction with law enforcement to Joe.</v>

725
00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:39.770
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

726
00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:42.500
<v Speaker 1>but whose credit card are you using?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going,</v>

727
00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:45.590
<v Speaker 1>but I've always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've reckoned flight would be the</v>

728
00:33:45.591 --> 00:33:46.424
<v Speaker 1>most amazing thing I'd love to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been meaning to get around to like </v>

729
00:33:49.431 --> 00:33:52.280
<v Speaker 1>learning to hang glide or paraglider,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of those types of things.</v>

730
00:33:52.281 --> 00:33:53.114
<v Speaker 1>I think that'd be a great hobby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who have you seen the new inside of </v>

731
00:33:55.491 --> 00:33:57.900
<v Speaker 1>planes that they're building?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're building.</v>

732
00:33:59.390 --> 00:34:01.490
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure they're going to do that.</v>

733
00:34:01.491 --> 00:34:03.950
<v Speaker 1>But you may passenger planes where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>interior.</v>

734
00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:07.280
<v Speaker 1>The exterior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen the mock ups of.</v>

735
00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:08.153
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well apparently they're thinking about </v>

736
00:34:09.411 --> 00:34:11.510
<v Speaker 1>making it or they're in development,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

737
00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:12.493
<v Speaker 1>if it becomes a reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ultimate goal is you're going to be </v>

738
00:34:15.381 --> 00:34:18.020
<v Speaker 1>flying and essentially what feels like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>convertible.</v>

739
00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:18.993
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the entire top of the plane is </v>

740
00:34:20.271 --> 00:34:21.104
<v Speaker 1>going to be a screen and you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to look up and see the actual </v>

741
00:34:24.590 --> 00:34:26.420
<v Speaker 1>sky above you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

742
00:34:26.421 --> 00:34:28.130
<v Speaker 1>they could do it on the floor as well if</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wanted to.</v>

743
00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:29.430
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That freak you out.</v>

744
00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:32.630
<v Speaker 1>Feel like you're just sitting in a chair</v>
<v Speaker 1>flying through space.</v>

745
00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:33.583
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sometimes wonder what the experience </v>

746
00:34:35.541 --> 00:34:38.780
<v Speaker 1>would have been like for like the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Malaysian Airlines plane that was</v>

747
00:34:38.781 --> 00:34:40.560
<v Speaker 1>blown up over Ukraine where like all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>

748
00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:42.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one minute you were at 34,000</v>

749
00:34:42.501 --> 00:34:45.230
<v Speaker 1>feet and then [inaudible] those </v>
<v Speaker 1>explosions,</v>

750
00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:48.860
<v Speaker 1>the way that those anti aircraft and </v>
<v Speaker 1>missiles go is they blow up outside the,</v>

751
00:34:49.350 --> 00:34:51.620
<v Speaker 1>the plane just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just immediately outside it.</v>

752
00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:56.070
<v Speaker 1>And then all of the shrapnel shatters </v>
<v Speaker 1>the plane and blow it apart.</v>

753
00:34:56.090 --> 00:34:58.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So did they shoot that thing down or did</v>

754
00:34:58.611 --> 00:35:00.350
<v Speaker 1>a bomb blow up on the plane?</v>

755
00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:02.750
<v Speaker 1>They shut it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was the,</v>

756
00:35:02.751 --> 00:35:03.584
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Russians.</v>

757
00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:05.740
<v Speaker 1>So it was a Russian shout,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a plane down for.</v>

758
00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:08.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You remember the Malaysia Airlines plane</v>

759
00:35:08.001 --> 00:35:10.150
<v Speaker 1>that went down Mih?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always get approved.</v>

760
00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:11.900
<v Speaker 1>Who Shot that down?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically.</v>

761
00:35:11.901 --> 00:35:12.734
<v Speaker 1>So Putin was alarming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't intentional that didn't know </v>

762
00:35:15.441 --> 00:35:18.440
<v Speaker 1>it was a passenger plane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was during the Ukrainian.</v>

763
00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:19.723
<v Speaker 1>Putin had annexed Crimea and was </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically fermenting a revolution in </v>

764
00:35:23.091 --> 00:35:23.924
<v Speaker 1>Ukraine because he resented the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ukrainian government being pro western </v>

765
00:35:27.171 --> 00:35:28.004
<v Speaker 1>and pro American and so they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>sending in Russian special forces in </v>

766
00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:34.460
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not in Russian uniforms,</v>

767
00:35:34.461 --> 00:35:38.070
<v Speaker 1>but our secret service guys will know </v>
<v Speaker 1>they are Russian</v>

768
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:38.933
<v Speaker 3>backed in Russia to finance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They using military hardware that only </v>

769
00:35:41.191 --> 00:35:42.024
<v Speaker 3>Russia could have gotten them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that a rag tag team of Ukrainian rebel </v>

770
00:35:45.751 --> 00:35:47.760
<v Speaker 3>San Francisco would never have been able</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get on their own,</v>

771
00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:48.623
<v Speaker 3>such as an anti aircraft.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ms Dot Paula can shoot a plane out of </v>

772
00:35:51.711 --> 00:35:53.850
<v Speaker 3>the sky from 34,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>feet.</v>

773
00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:55.313
<v Speaker 3>Now there are lots of conspiracy </v>
<v Speaker 3>theories that are put out by Moscow </v>

774
00:35:57.631 --> 00:35:59.520
<v Speaker 3>about this because of course Russia </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't accept it.</v>

775
00:35:59.521 --> 00:36:00.354
<v Speaker 3>They think that it was the west,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that it was the Ukrainians or </v>

776
00:36:02.581 --> 00:36:03.414
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there was a Malaysian airlines jet </v>

777
00:36:05.761 --> 00:36:09.870
<v Speaker 3>that was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala </v>
<v Speaker 3>Lumpur full of quite a lot of people who</v>

778
00:36:09.871 --> 00:36:10.704
<v Speaker 3>were heading to Melbourne actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is why I did quite a few stories </v>

779
00:36:13.891 --> 00:36:15.620
<v Speaker 3>on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

780
00:36:16.050 --> 00:36:19.500
<v Speaker 3>the that we're heading to Melbourne for </v>
<v Speaker 3>big AIDS conference was the big national</v>

781
00:36:19.501 --> 00:36:20.334
<v Speaker 3>aids conference,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so actually a lot of the world's best </v>

782
00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:24.710
<v Speaker 3>biggest best aids scientists and aids </v>
<v Speaker 3>research has died in that,</v>

783
00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:25.650
<v Speaker 3>in that crash.</v>

784
00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:29.220
<v Speaker 3>And they were just flying and they'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>been in the air for a few hours and they</v>

785
00:36:29.221 --> 00:36:30.054
<v Speaker 3>were going over Ukrainian airspace and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the rebels sore a speck in the sky and </v>

786
00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:38.160
<v Speaker 3>assumed that it wouldn't be a passenger </v>
<v Speaker 3>plane.</v>

787
00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:39.273
<v Speaker 3>Why they assume that I think that there </v>
<v Speaker 3>was a warning that passenger jets </v>

788
00:36:42.511 --> 00:36:47.511
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't be going over that area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think it was an off year.</v>

789
00:36:47.821 --> 00:36:48.654
<v Speaker 3>They assumed that it was a military </v>
<v Speaker 3>plane and they used one of these huge </v>

790
00:36:51.691 --> 00:36:54.540
<v Speaker 3>antiaircraft things and it's self God is</v>
<v Speaker 3>seeking.</v>

791
00:36:54.541 --> 00:36:56.600
<v Speaker 3>So it goes straight to the thing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then just as it is,</v>

792
00:36:56.601 --> 00:37:01.260
<v Speaker 3>it's next to it explodes and the plane's</v>
<v Speaker 3>splits into and just literally drops out</v>

793
00:37:01.261 --> 00:37:04.530
<v Speaker 3>of the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I sometimes wonder like,</v>

794
00:37:04.531 --> 00:37:07.440
<v Speaker 3>what is the experience when you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>sitting there,</v>

795
00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:11.850
<v Speaker 3>do you have a half a second to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to know what's happening?</v>

796
00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:12.660
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you must,</v>

797
00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:13.493
<v Speaker 3>you must write.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The deceleration is so fast that I've </v>

798
00:37:18.001 --> 00:37:18.834
<v Speaker 3>heard scientists say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't really know what's </v>

799
00:37:20.251 --> 00:37:20.640
<v Speaker 3>happening.</v>

800
00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:24.720
<v Speaker 3>You'd just sort of you pass out because </v>
<v Speaker 3>all of a sudden you're going from what,</v>

801
00:37:24.721 --> 00:37:28.460
<v Speaker 3>500 miles an hour down to and rapid </v>
<v Speaker 3>rapid deceleration.</v>

802
00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:30.720
<v Speaker 3>Obviously all of a sudden it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no air,</v>

803
00:37:31.110 --> 00:37:34.110
<v Speaker 3>there's no air anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's it's freezing cold,</v>

804
00:37:34.830 --> 00:37:39.710
<v Speaker 3>but I mean some people I would have </v>
<v Speaker 3>imagined would be semi momentarily aware</v>

805
00:37:39.711 --> 00:37:40.544
<v Speaker 3>that something horrible has happened and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's suddenly it's called tumbling out </v>

806
00:37:43.350 --> 00:37:44.670
<v Speaker 3>of the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of weird to.</v>

807
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:45.833
<v Speaker 3>So I don't want that kind of flight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe Don't know why that popped into my </v>

808
00:37:48.151 --> 00:37:49.110
<v Speaker 3>head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that whole story,</v>

809
00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:52.160
<v Speaker 3>but I want some kind of flight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

810
00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:53.580
<v Speaker 3>that's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

811
00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:54.720
<v Speaker 3>Me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Amazing.</v>

812
00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:58.050
<v Speaker 3>On the question of virtual reality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think,</v>

813
00:37:58.170 --> 00:38:03.170
<v Speaker 3>do you not think that we are so </v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamentally creatures of community,</v>

814
00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:05.033
<v Speaker 3>of communion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of communication that this dystopian </v>

815
00:38:09.061 --> 00:38:12.360
<v Speaker 3>vision of all of us just sitting solo </v>
<v Speaker 3>with our headsets on,</v>

816
00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:15.870
<v Speaker 3>having our own experiences is unlikely.</v>

817
00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:19.350
<v Speaker 3>I tend to think that there are going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be ways that we will find ways to use it</v>

818
00:38:19.351 --> 00:38:24.351
<v Speaker 3>to connect us more rather than less </v>
<v Speaker 3>because what makes it anything not,</v>

819
00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:26.160
<v Speaker 3>that's not a gimmick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't know.</v>

820
00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:28.470
<v Speaker 3>I can't foresee what virtual reality </v>
<v Speaker 3>will become.</v>

821
00:38:28.471 --> 00:38:32.580
<v Speaker 3>Like when film was invented,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they started out just by doing here's an</v>

822
00:38:32.581 --> 00:38:34.380
<v Speaker 3>image of a steam train and people were </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

823
00:38:34.381 --> 00:38:35.214
<v Speaker 3>oh my goodness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it looks like there's a steam </v>

824
00:38:36.371 --> 00:38:38.260
<v Speaker 3>train,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no one knew what the fuck to do with</v>

825
00:38:38.261 --> 00:38:39.650
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It took awhile.</v>

826
00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:42.520
<v Speaker 3>It took years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It took decades before the craft and art</v>

827
00:38:42.521 --> 00:38:43.354
<v Speaker 3>of cinematography and filmmaking became </v>
<v Speaker 3>a thing and I don't know that we know </v>

828
00:38:47.141 --> 00:38:49.690
<v Speaker 3>yet what virtual reality will become at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the moment.</v>

829
00:38:49.691 --> 00:38:51.970
<v Speaker 3>It strikes me as just something like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

830
00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:55.570
<v Speaker 4>it'll become everything can become.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not going to become any one thing.</v>

831
00:38:55.571 --> 00:38:57.190
<v Speaker 4>It's not going to go in only one </v>
<v Speaker 4>direction.</v>

832
00:38:57.191 --> 00:39:00.940
<v Speaker 4>All these directions that we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>proposing are not just possible,</v>

833
00:39:00.941 --> 00:39:04.930
<v Speaker 4>but most likely inevitable and whether </v>
<v Speaker 4>or not we're creatures of community.</v>

834
00:39:04.931 --> 00:39:07.930
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of people that seek </v>
<v Speaker 4>community online and that's the only way</v>

835
00:39:07.931 --> 00:39:08.764
<v Speaker 4>they get community and it's very </v>
<v Speaker 4>problematic in a lot of them when you </v>

836
00:39:11.021 --> 00:39:11.854
<v Speaker 4>find out like who they are as people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're really fucked up and one of the </v>

837
00:39:16.091 --> 00:39:16.924
<v Speaker 4>reasons why they're seeking community </v>
<v Speaker 4>online is because they don't have </v>

838
00:39:19.481 --> 00:39:20.314
<v Speaker 4>community in the actual physical world </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're disenfranchised and they're </v>

839
00:39:24.221 --> 00:39:25.990
<v Speaker 4>loners or they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

840
00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:29.440
<v Speaker 4>they're on the spectrum or there's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>bunch of different factors,</v>

841
00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:33.670
<v Speaker 4>a bunch of different social misfits that</v>
<v Speaker 4>are finding community online.</v>

842
00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:34.773
<v Speaker 4>I know places where you can go where you</v>
<v Speaker 4>could see the same people online </v>

843
00:39:36.971 --> 00:39:37.804
<v Speaker 4>literally 18 hours a day every day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some people that are on disability and </v>

844
00:39:41.831 --> 00:39:42.664
<v Speaker 4>they get checks and they never leave the</v>
<v Speaker 4>house and all they do is pay for their </v>

845
00:39:45.431 --> 00:39:46.264
<v Speaker 4>Internet connection and food and that is</v>
<v Speaker 4>where they exist and that is really </v>

846
00:39:50.471 --> 00:39:52.690
<v Speaker 4>common.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if that's really common,</v>

847
00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:53.553
<v Speaker 4>you know there's probably a million plus</v>
<v Speaker 4>people out there that are doing that </v>

848
00:39:56.051 --> 00:39:58.300
<v Speaker 4>every day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's going to stop them from going</v>

849
00:39:58.400 --> 00:39:59.350
<v Speaker 3>virtual?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They will,</v>

850
00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:00.210
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they will.</v>

851
00:40:00.210 --> 00:40:01.043
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think a lot of other people will </v>

852
00:40:01.591 --> 00:40:03.120
<v Speaker 4>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you think about what we're doing with</v>

853
00:40:03.121 --> 00:40:05.370
<v Speaker 4>phones,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know how many times have you gone to</v>

854
00:40:05.371 --> 00:40:07.470
<v Speaker 4>a restaurant?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see a table full of seven people.</v>

855
00:40:07.471 --> 00:40:10.110
<v Speaker 4>No one's talking to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everyone's staring at their phone.</v>

856
00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:13.590
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a form of virtual reality.</v>

857
00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:17.160
<v Speaker 4>You're going into the reality that </v>
<v Speaker 4>exists on your phone and you're like,</v>

858
00:40:17.161 --> 00:40:17.701
<v Speaker 4>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's.</v>

859
00:40:17.701 --> 00:40:18.534
<v Speaker 4>See what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're constantly updating it and </v>

860
00:40:19.991 --> 00:40:20.824
<v Speaker 4>constantly checking your facebook feed </v>
<v Speaker 4>to see if who's posted something </v>

861
00:40:23.401 --> 00:40:25.860
<v Speaker 4>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're clicking on videos and instead of</v>

862
00:40:25.861 --> 00:40:26.694
<v Speaker 4>talking to each other,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're showing each other some shit </v>

863
00:40:28.051 --> 00:40:30.690
<v Speaker 4>that's on your phone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is really common,</v>

864
00:40:30.691 --> 00:40:31.160
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

865
00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:32.690
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a big fucking problem.</v>

866
00:40:32.691 --> 00:40:35.240
<v Speaker 3>I think it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's deeper than we know</v>

867
00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:36.353
<v Speaker 4>Ari Shaffir and big Jay Oakerson did a </v>
<v Speaker 4>podcast where they were on the roof of </v>

868
00:40:38.851 --> 00:40:43.530
<v Speaker 4>this building and they were a peeping </v>
<v Speaker 4>tom on this.</v>

869
00:40:43.531 --> 00:40:44.364
<v Speaker 4>A couple of those couples about deaf sex</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they both started talking on their </v>

870
00:40:46.561 --> 00:40:48.120
<v Speaker 4>phones will start playing with their </v>
<v Speaker 4>phones.</v>

871
00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:49.103
<v Speaker 4>The woman was straddling this man and </v>
<v Speaker 4>she's looking at her phone and the guys </v>

872
00:40:51.331 --> 00:40:52.650
<v Speaker 4>underneath the girl and he starts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

873
00:40:54.330 --> 00:40:57.110
<v Speaker 3>I want to know why our Irish affairs </v>
<v Speaker 3>spying on people,</v>

874
00:40:57.130 --> 00:40:58.800
<v Speaker 3>what he does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a pervert.</v>

875
00:40:59.110 --> 00:40:59.943
<v Speaker 3>He's a creep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's what it's doing to our </v>

876
00:41:03.091 --> 00:41:04.020
<v Speaker 3>heads.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like,</v>

877
00:41:04.050 --> 00:41:04.883
<v Speaker 3>because like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so a friend of a friend of mine is a </v>

878
00:41:06.901 --> 00:41:11.901
<v Speaker 3>stand up here and in La and he first,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he got rid of his smartphone in favor of</v>

879
00:41:12.331 --> 00:41:16.410
<v Speaker 3>a flip phone already did that too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he got rid of his flip phone in</v>

880
00:41:16.411 --> 00:41:17.244
<v Speaker 3>favor of a home landline with an old </v>
<v Speaker 3>fashioned answering machine with a type </v>

881
00:41:20.561 --> 00:41:21.394
<v Speaker 3>in it because he feels like he enjoyed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He thinks there's a virtue in being </v>

882
00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:30.720
<v Speaker 3>bored.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's something to be in board.</v>

883
00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:31.593
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That you'll brain needs the space of </v>

884
00:41:34.731 --> 00:41:35.564
<v Speaker 3>having to conjure up imagination in its </v>
<v Speaker 3>own right in order to lead you to the </v>

885
00:41:39.621 --> 00:41:41.450
<v Speaker 3>muse because you never know when it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>gonna hit.</v>

886
00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:45.200
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly.</v>

887
00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:46.243
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think back to why not I was a kid and </v>

888
00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:55.610
<v Speaker 3>if you made arrangements to go and see a</v>
<v Speaker 3>movie with a buddy of yours,</v>

889
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:56.503
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was 15 and you said we'll just </v>

890
00:41:58.071 --> 00:42:01.910
<v Speaker 3>meet at the movie theater at five and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were going to be light.</v>

891
00:42:02.570 --> 00:42:06.510
<v Speaker 3>There was no way for you to know that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were going to be seven minutes late</v>

892
00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:07.603
<v Speaker 3>and during those seven minutes there was</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing for you to do and it's amazing </v>

893
00:42:11.121 --> 00:42:14.090
<v Speaker 3>to me that I'm amazed that that's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>case.</v>

894
00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:17.810
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing to me that now I can't even</v>
<v Speaker 3>really imagine just standing on a street</v>

895
00:42:17.811 --> 00:42:22.340
<v Speaker 3>corner outside of movie theater for </v>
<v Speaker 3>seven minutes being totally unruffled by</v>

896
00:42:22.341 --> 00:42:23.174
<v Speaker 3>the fact that a friend is seven minutes </v>
<v Speaker 3>late and being perfectly comfortable </v>

897
00:42:25.521 --> 00:42:28.340
<v Speaker 3>just doing what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gazing at the sky.</v>

898
00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:30.080
<v Speaker 3>Looking at passes by.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

899
00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:33.350
<v Speaker 3>That's what people have done for </v>
<v Speaker 3>thousands of years when they had to wait</v>

900
00:42:33.351 --> 00:42:34.184
<v Speaker 3>for something and that space,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that just psychic space of not having </v>

901
00:42:39.771 --> 00:42:42.140
<v Speaker 3>the ability to check who taught me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about me on twitter,</v>

902
00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:42.351
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

903
00:42:42.351 --> 00:42:43.730
<v Speaker 3>what's going on on facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what am I missing?</v>

904
00:42:43.731 --> 00:42:44.564
<v Speaker 3>What's happening?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know what's the latest photo from my </v>

905
00:42:45.831 --> 00:42:46.664
<v Speaker 3>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the latest news thing that's </v>

906
00:42:47.091 --> 00:42:49.490
<v Speaker 3>coming down?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just standing there.</v>

907
00:42:50.410 --> 00:42:54.560
<v Speaker 3>They life used to be punctuated by </v>
<v Speaker 3>moments like that all the time.</v>

908
00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:56.253
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I wonder whether those are the </v>

909
00:42:57.291 --> 00:42:58.124
<v Speaker 3>moments in which you come up with ideas </v>
<v Speaker 3>for the book that you want to ride or </v>

910
00:43:00.471 --> 00:43:01.304
<v Speaker 3>the standup bit that you want to do or </v>
<v Speaker 3>the painting that you want to pay until </v>

911
00:43:03.171 --> 00:43:04.220
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

912
00:43:04.221 --> 00:43:05.390
<v Speaker 3>the chair that you want to make.</v>

913
00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:09.250
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can or you can just actually work.</v>

914
00:43:11.410 --> 00:43:12.243
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people think that the music is </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to come to you when you're </v>

915
00:43:14.141 --> 00:43:15.850
<v Speaker 2>bored.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about you sit in front of your desk,</v>

916
00:43:15.851 --> 00:43:18.640
<v Speaker 2>you fucking Lazy Bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And actually right.</v>

917
00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:20.410
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's that too.</v>

918
00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:21.273
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there is absolutely an argument </v>

919
00:43:24.101 --> 00:43:26.800
<v Speaker 2>for not being constantly entertained by </v>
<v Speaker 2>electronics.</v>

920
00:43:26.801 --> 00:43:29.170
<v Speaker 2>There's absolutely an argument for that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know if that's the best one.</v>

921
00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:31.240
<v Speaker 2>I think um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lead is,</v>

922
00:43:31.390 --> 00:43:36.130
<v Speaker 2>well I think reflection and time alone </v>
<v Speaker 2>and also I think the,</v>

923
00:43:36.131 --> 00:43:38.040
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way to mitigate that is discipline.</v>

924
00:43:38.450 --> 00:43:40.770
<v Speaker 2>I think you have to have discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to have no wins.</v>

925
00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:42.340
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't</v>

926
00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:44.240
<v Speaker 3>and I appreciate moments of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

927
00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:45.093
<v Speaker 3>I used to love flying before you had </v>
<v Speaker 3>back televisions because it was a good </v>

928
00:43:47.681 --> 00:43:51.250
<v Speaker 3>excuse to just read and just gaze out </v>
<v Speaker 3>the window and just think now I watch tv</v>

929
00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:53.360
<v Speaker 3>because I don't do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm an</v>

930
00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:56.290
<v Speaker 2>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not though,</v>

931
00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:58.510
<v Speaker 2>but you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get a lot of things done.</v>

932
00:43:58.600 --> 00:43:59.620
<v Speaker 2>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but don't.</v>

933
00:43:59.621 --> 00:44:00.454
<v Speaker 2>I mean I like a lot of creative people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beat myself up a lot for not getting </v>

934
00:44:02.951 --> 00:44:04.000
<v Speaker 2>more done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I look at.</v>

935
00:44:04.070 --> 00:44:05.590
<v Speaker 2>I live as well and I get a lot done.</v>

936
00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:07.573
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think everyone looks at you and </v>

937
00:44:08.571 --> 00:44:09.021
<v Speaker 3>thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>

938
00:44:09.021 --> 00:44:11.690
<v Speaker 3>I wish I was more like Joe said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just did a lot of shit.</v>

939
00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:14.600
<v Speaker 3>He seems to have his shit together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guys like you and Tim Ferriss.</v>

940
00:44:15.110 --> 00:44:18.740
<v Speaker 3>You like an Anthony Robbins and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're always doing shit.</v>

941
00:44:19.090 --> 00:44:20.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But whereas a lot of us are the creative</v>

942
00:44:20.751 --> 00:44:23.040
<v Speaker 3>people spend a lot of time scratching </v>
<v Speaker 3>our head,</v>

943
00:44:23.041 --> 00:44:24.110
<v Speaker 3>scratching our offices.</v>

944
00:44:24.330 --> 00:44:26.400
<v Speaker 2>Here's the dirty secret.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm never satisfied.</v>

945
00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:31.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not everything I eat everything.</v>

946
00:44:31.651 --> 00:44:32.310
<v Speaker 2>I do</v>

947
00:44:32.310 --> 00:44:34.980
<v Speaker 4>have a podcast comes out great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm happy and everything like that,</v>

948
00:44:34.981 --> 00:44:36.870
<v Speaker 4>but I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get very little satisfaction from it.</v>

949
00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:37.733
<v Speaker 4>I just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All I think is the next one's got to be </v>

950
00:44:38.851 --> 00:44:40.090
<v Speaker 4>good to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's.</v>

951
00:44:40.110 --> 00:44:42.840
<v Speaker 4>Let's make sure the guest is good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's make sure the subject matters.</v>

952
00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:45.840
<v Speaker 4>That was good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Easy,</v>

953
00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:47.880
<v Speaker 4>easy fella.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're a good guest,</v>

954
00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:49.800
<v Speaker 4>but I've had some gas before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're like,</v>

955
00:44:49.801 --> 00:44:51.570
<v Speaker 4>oh Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to do all the heavy lifting here.</v>

956
00:44:51.710 --> 00:44:53.520
<v Speaker 4>Motherfuckers not even finishing his </v>
<v Speaker 4>sentences.</v>

957
00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:57.870
<v Speaker 4>I've had people like that before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Especially people that don't know how to</v>

958
00:44:57.871 --> 00:44:59.850
<v Speaker 4>do podcasts or they haven't done them </v>
<v Speaker 4>before.</v>

959
00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:00.983
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean podcasting itself is kind of a </v>

960
00:45:02.341 --> 00:45:03.174
<v Speaker 4>work of art.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a very pretentious way to describe </v>

961
00:45:05.461 --> 00:45:06.294
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I mean it is a creation and there's </v>

962
00:45:07.801 --> 00:45:08.634
<v Speaker 4>something that's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to be aware of how people are </v>

963
00:45:10.261 --> 00:45:12.780
<v Speaker 4>gonna perceive this creation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how they're going to ingest it,</v>

964
00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:13.913
<v Speaker 4>and it has to be as smooth as you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>make it and you have to learn from your </v>

965
00:45:15.991 --> 00:45:16.824
<v Speaker 4>mistakes and you have to make sure </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not talking over each other too </v>

966
00:45:18.541 --> 00:45:19.374
<v Speaker 4>much,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you also can't let someone ramble </v>

967
00:45:20.461 --> 00:45:21.360
<v Speaker 4>too much as well.</v>

968
00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:24.810
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes people get boring,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just drone on about things in their</v>

969
00:45:24.811 --> 00:45:25.644
<v Speaker 4>own,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in their own space and you've got to </v>

970
00:45:26.571 --> 00:45:29.000
<v Speaker 4>kind of pull them out of their space.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's A.</v>

971
00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.290
<v Speaker 4>There's like a craft to it all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

972
00:45:31.291 --> 00:45:33.690
<v Speaker 4>I do a lot of different things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but one of the reasons why I do a lot of</v>

973
00:45:33.691 --> 00:45:34.524
<v Speaker 4>different things is that they all kind </v>
<v Speaker 4>of symbiotically connected together in </v>

974
00:45:37.621 --> 00:45:40.830
<v Speaker 4>some sort of a weird way in that I love </v>
<v Speaker 4>them all.</v>

975
00:45:41.010 --> 00:45:41.843
<v Speaker 4>I enjoy doing them all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whether it's a comedy or mma commentary </v>

976
00:45:45.091 --> 00:45:48.030
<v Speaker 4>or podcasting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they all do sort of flow together.</v>

977
00:45:48.210 --> 00:45:49.550
<v Speaker 3>Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

978
00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:52.970
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting that you say that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a craft to podcasting.</v>

979
00:45:52.971 --> 00:45:53.804
<v Speaker 3>In terms of how.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were talking about this a little bit </v>

980
00:45:55.581 --> 00:45:56.414
<v Speaker 3>last night with Sam Harrison on my </v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast about when should you interrupt </v>

981
00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:00.973
<v Speaker 3>and when should you not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not interrupt because I find that </v>

982
00:46:04.850 --> 00:46:05.683
<v Speaker 3>sometimes I'll be criticized for </v>
<v Speaker 3>interrupting somebody on my podcast and </v>

983
00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:10.333
<v Speaker 3>as far as I'm concerned what I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The last thing I want my podcast to be </v>

984
00:46:13.311 --> 00:46:14.144
<v Speaker 3>or any form of entertaining conversation</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be is just a sequence of speeches </v>

985
00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:20.453
<v Speaker 3>that two people give to one another.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is one of the things that's </v>

986
00:46:22.191 --> 00:46:24.310
<v Speaker 3>appealing about your podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

987
00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:25.233
<v Speaker 3>you come into this with a two to three </v>
<v Speaker 3>hour stretch ahead of you with </v>

988
00:46:28.730 --> 00:46:32.240
<v Speaker 3>absolutely no idea what's going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen and no preconceptions about where</v>

989
00:46:32.241 --> 00:46:35.660
<v Speaker 3>it's going to go and the joy of it is </v>
<v Speaker 3>the is the dance,</v>

990
00:46:35.661 --> 00:46:36.494
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is the interplay like I don't know what </v>

991
00:46:37.191 --> 00:46:39.230
<v Speaker 3>was going to be talking about in five </v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes time and neither do you.</v>

992
00:46:39.590 --> 00:46:40.423
<v Speaker 3>So it's interesting to find out and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>feel like if you have too nice to other </v>

993
00:46:45.651 --> 00:46:49.610
<v Speaker 3>people and don't interrupt them in order</v>
<v Speaker 3>to create that dance,</v>

994
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:50.833
<v Speaker 3>then there's basically one person </v>
<v Speaker 3>standing on the sidelines and another </v>

995
00:46:53.571 --> 00:46:56.540
<v Speaker 3>person trying to do the two step or the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Flamenco by themselves.</v>

996
00:46:56.780 --> 00:46:57.613
<v Speaker 4>But that depends on who the guest is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there's certain guests like Dr </v>

997
00:47:00.590 --> 00:47:04.580
<v Speaker 4>Rhonda Patrick is a perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All I do is wind her up and let her go.</v>

998
00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:08.990
<v Speaker 4>I mean I interact with her a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 4>but as little as possible and she's just</v>

999
00:47:08.991 --> 00:47:09.824
<v Speaker 4>such a dynamo that all I have to do is </v>
<v Speaker 4>ask her questions about the mechanisms </v>

1000
00:47:14.451 --> 00:47:15.284
<v Speaker 4>of certain vitamin absorption or </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever we're talking about cold shock </v>

1001
00:47:17.691 --> 00:47:18.890
<v Speaker 4>therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever the fuck it is.</v>

1002
00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:22.040
<v Speaker 4>And she just goes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So in that case,</v>

1003
00:47:22.041 --> 00:47:24.560
<v Speaker 4>if I wanted to chime in and have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>normal conversation,</v>

1004
00:47:24.561 --> 00:47:26.390
<v Speaker 4>I'd fuck up the flow of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>conversation.</v>

1005
00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:29.710
<v Speaker 4>So going to know you to have the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas you and I,</v>

1006
00:47:29.860 --> 00:47:32.740
<v Speaker 4>we always have these silly conversations</v>
<v Speaker 4>that goes all over the place.</v>

1007
00:47:32.741 --> 00:47:34.360
<v Speaker 4>We're laughing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're serious.</v>

1008
00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:36.790
<v Speaker 4>It's very fluid and it goes back and </v>
<v Speaker 4>forth.</v>

1009
00:47:37.090 --> 00:47:40.150
<v Speaker 4>But you like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am not a fucking medical expert.</v>

1010
00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:41.273
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we're not experts in anything </v>

1011
00:47:42.650 --> 00:47:44.370
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what kind of what I like.</v>

1012
00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:45.693
<v Speaker 3>I like being a polymath.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like having a lot of fingers in </v>

1013
00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:52.400
<v Speaker 3>different pies and polymath polymath </v>
<v Speaker 3>person who is for who's good at it can.</v>

1014
00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:54.450
<v Speaker 3>Can we get a definition on polymath?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie?</v>

1015
00:47:55.100 --> 00:47:55.933
<v Speaker 3>I understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To be a person who's interested in and </v>

1016
00:47:57.151 --> 00:48:00.270
<v Speaker 3>good at several different disciplines </v>
<v Speaker 3>like doesn't really focus on one.</v>

1017
00:48:01.110 --> 00:48:03.990
<v Speaker 3>I prefer smile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A renaissance man,</v>

1018
00:48:04.050 --> 00:48:06.360
<v Speaker 3>a person of wide ranging knowledge or </v>
<v Speaker 3>learning well.</v>

1019
00:48:06.361 --> 00:48:07.200

1020
00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:08.113
<v Speaker 4>bands.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A significant number of different </v>

1021
00:48:09.141 --> 00:48:11.390
<v Speaker 4>subject areas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's an expertise.</v>

1022
00:48:11.420 --> 00:48:12.253
<v Speaker 4>Many expertise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So a person who is known to draw on </v>

1023
00:48:14.031 --> 00:48:16.640
<v Speaker 4>complex bodies of knowledge to solve </v>
<v Speaker 4>specific problem.</v>

1024
00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:18.060
<v Speaker 3>Well that's the Wiki.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was no,</v>

1025
00:48:18.140 --> 00:48:20.220
<v Speaker 3>look at the one above.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was using the general,</v>

1026
00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:23.130
<v Speaker 3>the general use ranging knowledge or </v>
<v Speaker 3>learning.</v>

1027
00:48:23.170 --> 00:48:23.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>

1028
00:48:23.820 --> 00:48:28.270
<v Speaker 3>Well that's just a more pronounced </v>
<v Speaker 3>version of it or more polymath.</v>

1029
00:48:28.290 --> 00:48:30.720
<v Speaker 3>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much time do you spend distracted by</v>

1030
00:48:30.721 --> 00:48:31.554
<v Speaker 3>your phone?</v>

1031
00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:32.890
<v Speaker 4>I tried very low,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more,</v>

1032
00:48:33.070 --> 00:48:36.160
<v Speaker 4>less lately than ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been really good about it.</v>

1033
00:48:36.161 --> 00:48:38.320
<v Speaker 4>Over the last few months,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I went to,</v>

1034
00:48:38.490 --> 00:48:43.150
<v Speaker 4>I was in the Nevada high country in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>desert last week,</v>

1035
00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:45.250
<v Speaker 3>just for a whole week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love this.</v>

1036
00:48:45.251 --> 00:48:46.360
<v Speaker 3>I love the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love that.</v>

1037
00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:50.170
<v Speaker 3>Just for your listeners,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I got my book a trip to La.</v>

1038
00:48:50.171 --> 00:48:52.570
<v Speaker 3>I had a few meetings out here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm always here at the last minute,</v>

1039
00:48:52.571 --> 00:48:55.360
<v Speaker 3>so I never had never planned in advance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I send you a text,</v>

1040
00:48:55.690 --> 00:48:57.190
<v Speaker 3>don't hear from him for a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 3>days.</v>

1041
00:48:57.280 --> 00:48:58.780
<v Speaker 3>He gets back to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry I've.</v>

1042
00:48:59.210 --> 00:49:03.550
<v Speaker 3>I've been in the wilderness like my </v>
<v Speaker 3>image of you is like you didn't have any</v>

1043
00:49:03.551 --> 00:49:04.384
<v Speaker 3>cell phone reception.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're out in the woods and in my brain </v>

1044
00:49:07.031 --> 00:49:09.760
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're naked on the back of a horse.</v>

1045
00:49:09.761 --> 00:49:11.770
<v Speaker 3>Like shooting elk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1046
00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:13.050
<v Speaker 3>I was trying to shoot</v>

1047
00:49:13.110 --> 00:49:15.210
<v Speaker 4>mule deer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was in the desert.</v>

1048
00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:19.830
<v Speaker 4>I was camping and those were the a group</v>
<v Speaker 4>of friends and we were on a hunting trip</v>

1049
00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:22.410
<v Speaker 4>and we were there for seven days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No Cell Phone Reception,</v>

1050
00:49:22.620 --> 00:49:24.810
<v Speaker 4>no pee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We occasionally saw another hunter,</v>

1051
00:49:25.490 --> 00:49:26.530
<v Speaker 4>but that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're just saying,</v>

1052
00:49:26.531 --> 00:49:28.740
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're on public land in the wilderness</v>

1053
00:49:29.010 --> 00:49:32.310
<v Speaker 4>and chasing after dear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to do more of the seven days.</v>

1054
00:49:32.370 --> 00:49:34.010
<v Speaker 4>No cell phone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many female?</v>

1055
00:49:34.050 --> 00:49:36.930
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was five of us total.</v>

1056
00:49:36.931 --> 00:49:37.710
<v Speaker 4>One,</v>
<v Speaker 4>two,</v>

1057
00:49:37.710 --> 00:49:38.311
<v Speaker 4>three,</v>
<v Speaker 4>four,</v>

1058
00:49:38.311 --> 00:49:39.150
<v Speaker 4>five,</v>
<v Speaker 4>six.</v>

1059
00:49:39.151 --> 00:49:40.470
<v Speaker 4>Six of US total.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Great.</v>

1060
00:49:40.650 --> 00:49:42.390
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What'd you it off into?</v>

1061
00:49:42.391 --> 00:49:43.760
<v Speaker 4>Two groups.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We brought food,</v>

1062
00:49:44.430 --> 00:49:47.460
<v Speaker 4>brought a freeze dried foods,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these things called mountain ops,</v>

1063
00:49:47.620 --> 00:49:48.453
<v Speaker 4>the you add water to them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This freeze dried fruits and dehydrated </v>

1064
00:49:52.051 --> 00:49:54.300
<v Speaker 4>foods and then we brought some whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>foods,</v>

1065
00:49:54.301 --> 00:49:56.450
<v Speaker 4>some actual real foods.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We ate that all by the,</v>

1066
00:49:56.451 --> 00:50:00.180
<v Speaker 4>like the fourth or fifth day and then we</v>
<v Speaker 4>not shitty freeze dried stuff,</v>

1067
00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:01.553
<v Speaker 4>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're hoping we going to eat a deer but </v>

1068
00:50:03.031 --> 00:50:06.540
<v Speaker 4>we struck out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it was a very fun time and even just</v>

1069
00:50:06.541 --> 00:50:07.374
<v Speaker 4>for the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just the release of just being </v>

1070
00:50:08.911 --> 00:50:09.744
<v Speaker 4>disconnected from society.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But point is I try to do that several </v>

1071
00:50:12.841 --> 00:50:15.390
<v Speaker 4>times a year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do that maybe five times a year,</v>

1072
00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:16.373
<v Speaker 4>but more important than that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I leave that fucking thing alone more </v>

1073
00:50:18.721 --> 00:50:21.090
<v Speaker 4>than I've ever done before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I treat that thing.</v>

1074
00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:24.210
<v Speaker 4>If I spend too much time with it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to give me a disease.</v>

1075
00:50:24.420 --> 00:50:25.520
<v Speaker 3>I think it does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1076
00:50:25.980 --> 00:50:27.860
<v Speaker 3>I think it does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And don't know why.</v>

1077
00:50:27.861 --> 00:50:28.030
<v Speaker 3>I don't</v>

1078
00:50:28.030 --> 00:50:28.863
<v Speaker 1>know what's changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to put my finger on what it </v>

1079
00:50:31.041 --> 00:50:33.410
<v Speaker 1>is about my relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially to twitter.</v>

1080
00:50:33.950 --> 00:50:36.070
<v Speaker 1>That has changed because it's a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>wholesome.</v>

1081
00:50:36.370 --> 00:50:37.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>

1082
00:50:37.770 --> 00:50:40.160
<v Speaker 1>With so many assholes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you realize like in my real life,</v>

1083
00:50:40.460 --> 00:50:42.190
<v Speaker 1>how many people do I get in contact with</v>
<v Speaker 1>them?</v>

1084
00:50:42.191 --> 00:50:44.090
<v Speaker 1>Make me feel awful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very few.</v>

1085
00:50:44.091 --> 00:50:45.560
<v Speaker 1>Almost zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost zero.</v>

1086
00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:48.230
<v Speaker 1>So you choose to hang out with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>

1087
00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:49.730
<v Speaker 1>choose to hang out with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>acquaintances.</v>

1088
00:50:49.731 --> 00:50:51.620
<v Speaker 1>All the people that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you interact with people.</v>

1089
00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:53.630
<v Speaker 1>And even if I meet someone and they're a</v>
<v Speaker 1>stranger,</v>

1090
00:50:53.870 --> 00:50:58.870
<v Speaker 1>99 point nine times when I meet them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a pleasant interaction.</v>

1091
00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:04.190
<v Speaker 1>It's very rare that I find someone who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like really truly rude or where it can't</v>

1092
00:51:04.191 --> 00:51:05.024
<v Speaker 1>be worked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know where you can't walk away from </v>

1093
00:51:06.681 --> 00:51:09.200
<v Speaker 1>it with a handshake and feeling good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this thing,</v>

1094
00:51:09.530 --> 00:51:13.610
<v Speaker 1>this w two dimensional conversation </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you don't know who the person is,</v>

1095
00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:16.100
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they're coming from.</v>

1096
00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:19.910
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what their agenda is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what their life is like.</v>

1097
00:51:19.911 --> 00:51:20.744
<v Speaker 1>You don't know anything about them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they say something and you react to </v>

1098
00:51:23.031 --> 00:51:27.900
<v Speaker 1>that 130 plus characters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there are two problems,</v>

1099
00:51:27.901 --> 00:51:29.180
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is the,</v>

1100
00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:30.073
<v Speaker 1>the absence of destroy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the distractedness that it kind of </v>

1101
00:51:32.870 --> 00:51:35.120
<v Speaker 1>fosters in our lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that it rubs,</v>

1102
00:51:35.330 --> 00:51:37.040
<v Speaker 1>at least in my experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can only speak for me,</v>

1103
00:51:37.041 --> 00:51:42.041
<v Speaker 1>it rubs me of moments of Zen that could </v>
<v Speaker 1>exist throughout the day by plunging,</v>

1104
00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:43.273
<v Speaker 1>by know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know physiologically that it gives </v>

1105
00:51:45.621 --> 00:51:46.454
<v Speaker 1>you a little dopamine hit every time you</v>
<v Speaker 1>notice that someone's mentioned you on </v>

1106
00:51:49.071 --> 00:51:49.904
<v Speaker 1>twitter and said something right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you get a true that they'd done </v>

1107
00:51:51.381 --> 00:51:53.310
<v Speaker 1>like studies with people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1108
00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:55.730
<v Speaker 1>You get a little hit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a little drug hit.</v>

1109
00:51:55.731 --> 00:51:57.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean just a tiny drip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drip,</v>

1110
00:51:57.110 --> 00:51:57.943
<v Speaker 1>drip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like having a little piece of </v>

1111
00:51:58.581 --> 00:51:59.150
<v Speaker 1>candy.</v>

1112
00:51:59.150 --> 00:52:02.570
<v Speaker 1>I could just get dripped all day then </v>
<v Speaker 1>just sit around and just drip away.</v>

1113
00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:03.740
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people do drip,</v>

1114
00:52:03.741 --> 00:52:04.574
<v Speaker 1>drip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drip,</v>

1115
00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:07.850
<v Speaker 1>crazy man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's that.</v>

1116
00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:10.610
<v Speaker 1>There's the fact that I'm constantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting that literally hit by,</v>

1117
00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:13.670
<v Speaker 1>by lugging on what is that an energy </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing when you're writing?</v>

<v Speaker 1>What does it contain?</v>

1121
00:52:18.530 --> 00:52:20.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I should know this because I know</v>

1122
00:52:20.001 --> 00:52:22.420
<v Speaker 1>that you're the guy not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't worry about it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>and they want to feel bad if that irate </v>
<v Speaker 1>to stay off twitter.</v>

1141
00:53:04.190 --> 00:53:05.023
<v Speaker 1>And so this is interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in addition to it being a kind of a </v>

1142
00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:11.420
<v Speaker 1>drug that you keep in your pocket,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that stops you from,</v>

1143
00:53:11.590 --> 00:53:12.423
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from ever just being alone with </v>

1144
00:53:13.761 --> 00:53:16.280
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen that?</v>

1145
00:53:16.281 --> 00:53:18.110
<v Speaker 1>Louis ck bit by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>

1146
00:53:18.111 --> 00:53:18.944
<v Speaker 1>I think he's on Conan where he's talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about why it doesn't want to give his </v>

1147
00:53:20.910 --> 00:53:24.080
<v Speaker 1>daughter's phone because like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

1148
00:53:24.081 --> 00:53:24.914
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he was like,</v>

1149
00:53:25.090 --> 00:53:25.923
<v Speaker 1>he was stopped in traffic at lights and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he felt something inside that he didn't </v>

1150
00:53:29.371 --> 00:53:30.204
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was like the experience of being </v>

1151
00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:33.233
<v Speaker 1>human.</v>

1152
00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:37.140
<v Speaker 1>And so he reached for his phone and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>he realized that that's what we do.</v>

1153
00:53:37.350 --> 00:53:41.580
<v Speaker 1>Like the moment we start to feel the </v>
<v Speaker 1>great emptiness of being alive,</v>

1154
00:53:42.270 --> 00:53:43.103
<v Speaker 1>we reach for our phone and but one on </v>
<v Speaker 1>one occasion he didn't reach for his </v>

1155
00:53:45.121 --> 00:53:45.954
<v Speaker 1>phone and he pulled over the side of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>road and like started bawling his eyes </v>

1156
00:53:48.181 --> 00:53:50.220
<v Speaker 1>out and it was so cathartic and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful.</v>

1157
00:53:50.221 --> 00:53:53.120
<v Speaker 1>And then he recovered and he like had </v>
<v Speaker 1>this wonderful spiritual goal.</v>

1158
00:53:53.121 --> 00:53:54.940
<v Speaker 1>Some experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold the fuck on.</v>

1159
00:53:55.500 --> 00:53:56.333
<v Speaker 1>He just started crying song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some songs on the radio and it </v>

1160
00:53:59.910 --> 00:54:01.440
<v Speaker 1>was so beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

1161
00:54:01.441 --> 00:54:03.630
<v Speaker 1>he gets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he waxes all lyrical and gets old poetic</v>

1162
00:54:03.631 --> 00:54:06.960
<v Speaker 1>Louis ck growing a vagina right in front</v>
<v Speaker 1>of her eyes.</v>

1163
00:54:06.961 --> 00:54:09.720
<v Speaker 1>You heard it here first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Louie Joe Rogan says you have a vagina.</v>

1164
00:54:10.130 --> 00:54:10.963
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go ahead.</v>

1165
00:54:11.300 --> 00:54:12.133
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's his point is like that's what </v>

1166
00:54:14.370 --> 00:54:15.203
<v Speaker 1>part of the experience of being human is</v>
<v Speaker 1>all about his side of the road with a </v>

1167
00:54:18.571 --> 00:54:21.840
<v Speaker 1>car listening to magic created by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>machine.</v>

1168
00:54:22.180 --> 00:54:23.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So human.</v>

1169
00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:26.850
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's the wrong example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can Pussy.</v>

1170
00:54:28.260 --> 00:54:30.080
<v Speaker 1>So in addition to that then you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking,</v>

1171
00:54:32.790 --> 00:54:33.623
<v Speaker 1>people were tweeting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Louis right now doesn't even have a </v>

1172
00:54:36.721 --> 00:54:40.050
<v Speaker 1>twitter anymore that's wise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Deleted his twitter.</v>

1173
00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:42.000
<v Speaker 1>Well he sells out Madison Square Garden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1174
00:54:42.001 --> 00:54:44.100
<v Speaker 1>What does he need a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>disappointed.</v>

1175
00:54:44.101 --> 00:54:44.934
<v Speaker 1>I was one of these schmucks who bought a</v>
<v Speaker 1>ticket to see him at Madison Square </v>

1176
00:54:47.140 --> 00:54:47.973
<v Speaker 1>Garden a couple of weeks and I'm now I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking I used to see him when he was </v>

1177
00:54:49.861 --> 00:54:52.420
<v Speaker 1>at the seller like I used to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went at Austin,</v>

1178
00:54:52.430 --> 00:54:56.610
<v Speaker 1>come aspen comedy festival and saw him </v>
<v Speaker 1>with 50 people in the room.</v>

1179
00:54:56.611 --> 00:54:57.640
<v Speaker 1>Why am I going to be sitting?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1180
00:54:57.730 --> 00:55:00.690
<v Speaker 1>I'll feel like it's not going to be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same in the garden,</v>

1181
00:55:01.100 --> 00:55:01.933
<v Speaker 1>but definitely not going to be the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's a different show different </v>

1182
00:55:04.831 --> 00:55:07.210
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1183
00:55:07.211 --> 00:55:10.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what you wanted to see the stadium so</v>

1184
00:55:10.021 --> 00:55:11.790
<v Speaker 1>you could see him at the comedy store in</v>
<v Speaker 1>here all the time.</v>

1185
00:55:11.810 --> 00:55:13.920
<v Speaker 1>Can you just come over to my place and </v>
<v Speaker 1>do it in my living room?</v>

1186
00:55:13.950 --> 00:55:16.230
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just got weird real.</v>

1188
00:55:17.980 --> 00:55:18.813
<v Speaker 1>I'm crying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be on virtual reality </v>

1189
00:55:19.711 --> 00:55:21.270
<v Speaker 1>watching porn and he's going to be doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bit.</v>

1190
00:55:22.260 --> 00:55:23.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be different.</v>

1191
00:55:23.611 --> 00:55:25.950
<v Speaker 1>He's doing a big gigantic show and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1192
00:55:26.100 --> 00:55:27.570
<v Speaker 1>making a lot more money doing it that </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

1193
00:55:28.350 --> 00:55:29.183
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well he apparently emptied out his bank </v>

1194
00:55:31.111 --> 00:55:33.730
<v Speaker 1>account to create that horror series.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1195
00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:35.460
<v Speaker 1>Horace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Pete was the animated series.</v>

1196
00:55:35.461 --> 00:55:37.320
<v Speaker 1>That's not unlimited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1197
00:55:37.660 --> 00:55:39.290
<v Speaker 1>Harrison paid is a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>is like a,</v>

1198
00:55:39.330 --> 00:55:44.330
<v Speaker 1>an old school kind of multicam no studio</v>
<v Speaker 1>audience.</v>

1199
00:55:44.790 --> 00:55:46.640
<v Speaker 1>I never watched it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody told me it was animated.</v>

1200
00:55:46.650 --> 00:55:50.040
<v Speaker 1>Who said call me fucking assume they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were right.</v>

1201
00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:52.140
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was anime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No it's not.</v>

1202
00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:54.690
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has a drawing as it's icon.</v>

1203
00:55:55.170 --> 00:55:57.540
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what it is.</v>

1204
00:55:57.630 --> 00:55:59.110
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what is,</v>

1205
00:55:59.111 --> 00:56:03.560
<v Speaker 1>is it good?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is innovative in a way that only a,</v>

1206
00:56:03.570 --> 00:56:06.510
<v Speaker 1>an altar like Louis would have the balls</v>
<v Speaker 1>to pull off.</v>

1207
00:56:06.540 --> 00:56:08.970
<v Speaker 1>Is that a tactful way of dodging the </v>
<v Speaker 1>question?</v>

1208
00:56:09.060 --> 00:56:12.720
<v Speaker 1>So I don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just kidding the first.</v>

1209
00:56:12.930 --> 00:56:15.270
<v Speaker 1>So He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he fucks with you.</v>

1210
00:56:15.271 --> 00:56:16.104
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember his original Louie Lucky Louie </v>

1211
00:56:18.990 --> 00:56:21.410
<v Speaker 1>on Hbo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that was done to,</v>

1212
00:56:21.590 --> 00:56:24.190
<v Speaker 1>to sort of look like the and like with </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad</v>

1213
00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:26.230
<v Speaker 3>sets that Kinda shook and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1214
00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:27.093
<v Speaker 3>bad studio audience was like a very sort</v>
<v Speaker 3>of 19 sixties Sitcom feel and everyone </v>

1215
00:56:31.060 --> 00:56:33.790
<v Speaker 3>criticized it because they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh that production values are terrible.</v>

1216
00:56:33.791 --> 00:56:34.870
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well yeah,</v>

1217
00:56:34.871 --> 00:56:37.030
<v Speaker 3>we fucking know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like hbo doesn't have the money</v>

1218
00:56:37.031 --> 00:56:38.530
<v Speaker 3>to get a good set.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we wanted a good set,</v>

1219
00:56:38.690 --> 00:56:40.330
<v Speaker 3>it's supposed to look like an old </v>
<v Speaker 3>sitcom,</v>

1220
00:56:40.660 --> 00:56:44.680
<v Speaker 3>but it's a very sort of metta like fuck </v>
<v Speaker 3>you concept.</v>

1221
00:56:45.070 --> 00:56:45.903
<v Speaker 3>And in a similar way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what he's done here is he's basically </v>

1222
00:56:47.801 --> 00:56:50.320
<v Speaker 3>done a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a dramatic,</v>

1223
00:56:50.620 --> 00:56:51.453
<v Speaker 3>sort of almost 19 seventies English </v>
<v Speaker 3>style play that is shot with no studio </v>

1224
00:56:59.291 --> 00:57:01.030
<v Speaker 3>audience with very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

1225
00:57:01.031 --> 00:57:06.031
<v Speaker 3>very long scenes and long takes that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>very dark and a bit whimsical and funny.</v>

1226
00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:08.193
<v Speaker 3>But I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I only got through a few episodes and </v>

1227
00:57:09.251 --> 00:57:11.140
<v Speaker 3>then it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although I respected it,</v>

1228
00:57:11.141 --> 00:57:12.880
<v Speaker 3>it just wasn't a way that I want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>spend my evening,</v>

1229
00:57:12.881 --> 00:57:13.870
<v Speaker 3>if that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1230
00:57:13.871 --> 00:57:14.620
<v Speaker 3>that does make sense.</v>

1231
00:57:14.620 --> 00:57:16.000
<v Speaker 4>You mean it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a piece of art.</v>

1232
00:57:16.060 --> 00:57:17.270
<v Speaker 4>You're creating something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1233
00:57:17.410 --> 00:57:18.243
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And also when you're creating something </v>

1234
00:57:19.811 --> 00:57:20.644
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially when it comes to like a </v>

1235
00:57:21.011 --> 00:57:21.844
<v Speaker 4>sitcom or something along those lines,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it takes a long time for it to find its </v>

1236
00:57:25.451 --> 00:57:28.840
<v Speaker 4>legs for you to figure out like what the</v>
<v Speaker 4>characters are all about and what,</v>

1237
00:57:28.870 --> 00:57:30.820
<v Speaker 4>how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how the scenes are going to play out.</v>

1238
00:57:31.060 --> 00:57:34.930
<v Speaker 4>Every Sitcom that I've ever seen or the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ones that I've been a part of,</v>

1239
00:57:35.260 --> 00:57:36.580
<v Speaker 4>they take many,</v>
<v Speaker 4>many,</v>

1240
00:57:36.581 --> 00:57:40.310
<v Speaker 4>many episodes to create.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like to figure out what,</v>

1241
00:57:40.350 --> 00:57:42.670
<v Speaker 4>what it actually is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then along the way,</v>

1242
00:57:42.671 --> 00:57:45.790
<v Speaker 4>like you have to have someone who </v>
<v Speaker 4>believes in it and they're financing it,</v>

1243
00:57:45.850 --> 00:57:47.430
<v Speaker 4>funding it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he loved him,</v>

1244
00:57:47.650 --> 00:57:50.290
<v Speaker 4>did all that shit on his own,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he emptied out his fucking</v>

1245
00:57:51.160 --> 00:57:53.690
<v Speaker 3>and he's already made it back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now everything from now,</v>

1246
00:57:53.830 --> 00:57:54.663
<v Speaker 3>now he hasn't made any sales of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he's made it all back just from </v>

1247
00:57:56.711 --> 00:57:57.544
<v Speaker 3>Internet sales according to him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then so whatever sale he ends up </v>

1248
00:58:00.911 --> 00:58:02.680
<v Speaker 3>making,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if he sells it Netflix or whatever,</v>

1249
00:58:02.681 --> 00:58:04.540
<v Speaker 3>he's apparently waiting for the emmy's </v>
<v Speaker 3>because he wants to.</v>

1250
00:58:04.870 --> 00:58:07.750
<v Speaker 3>He's hoping we'll get some of then will </v>
<v Speaker 3>be in a stronger negotiating position.</v>

1251
00:58:08.080 --> 00:58:09.880
<v Speaker 3>But all of that will be profit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One hundred percent profit.</v>

1252
00:58:10.060 --> 00:58:12.190
<v Speaker 4>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he did make the money back,</v>

1253
00:58:12.191 --> 00:58:14.740
<v Speaker 4>so he complained about it and then after</v>
<v Speaker 4>he complained about it,</v>

1254
00:58:14.741 --> 00:58:15.574
<v Speaker 4>he made more</v>

1255
00:58:15.830 --> 00:58:16.663
<v Speaker 3>complaining about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thing was he claims that was just a </v>

1256
00:58:18.261 --> 00:58:20.650
<v Speaker 3>bullshit and media spin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was on Howard I think.</v>

1257
00:58:20.651 --> 00:58:22.560
<v Speaker 3>I think it was on Howard stern show us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1258
00:58:22.810 --> 00:58:23.061
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1259
00:58:23.061 --> 00:58:24.290
<v Speaker 3>He didn't lie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What he was saying,</v>

1260
00:58:24.470 --> 00:58:25.303
<v Speaker 3>his point is that he was saying that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>spent all of his money and he was like </v>

1261
00:58:27.981 --> 00:58:29.560
<v Speaker 3>joking about how like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1262
00:58:29.570 --> 00:58:32.450
<v Speaker 3>I spent all my money on this thing and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>have no idea if it's gonna work and then</v>

1263
00:58:32.451 --> 00:58:37.451
<v Speaker 3>some fucking clickbait media outlet was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like Louis ck broke off to,</v>

1264
00:58:37.520 --> 00:58:39.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>losing all of his money on the show.</v>

1265
00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:40.191
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1266
00:58:40.191 --> 00:58:42.020
<v Speaker 3>I never expected to get my money back </v>
<v Speaker 3>immediately.</v>

1267
00:58:42.140 --> 00:58:42.973
<v Speaker 3>This is an experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I put my money and it's an investment </v>

1268
00:58:44.451 --> 00:58:46.550
<v Speaker 3>and now like it's paid off.</v>

1269
00:58:46.650 --> 00:58:47.483
<v Speaker 4>That was all the money that he had and </v>
<v Speaker 4>he was just doing that and then he had </v>

1270
00:58:49.621 --> 00:58:50.454
<v Speaker 4>to go on tour.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that was part of what you're </v>

1271
00:58:51.241 --> 00:58:52.074
<v Speaker 4>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that he's going on tour for more money </v>

1272
00:58:53.130 --> 00:58:54.600
<v Speaker 4>because he had emptied his bank account.</v>

1273
00:58:55.300 --> 00:58:56.133
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's different from losing you </v>

1274
00:58:56.761 --> 00:58:57.594
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He invested his money in this thing and </v>

1275
00:58:59.510 --> 00:59:03.300
<v Speaker 3>now and while he was waiting for it to </v>
<v Speaker 3>pay for it to pay itself off them,</v>

1276
00:59:03.320 --> 00:59:05.540
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of news articles came out about </v>
<v Speaker 3>how he had no money.</v>

1277
00:59:05.570 --> 00:59:06.680
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what people want to hear.</v>

1278
00:59:06.681 --> 00:59:07.514
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to hear what a wonderful</v>
<v Speaker 3>investment in data and create creative </v>

1279
00:59:11.361 --> 00:59:14.960
<v Speaker 3>venture that was profitable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wants to hear that he's a loser now.</v>

1280
00:59:14.970 --> 00:59:17.920
<v Speaker 3>Sucking dicks for homemade one</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1283
00:59:28.910 --> 00:59:32.750
<v Speaker 1>a reasonable sort of a risk and it pays </v>
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

1284
00:59:33.410 --> 00:59:35.450
<v Speaker 1>It's not a great story is already </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful.</v>

1288
00:59:42.950 --> 00:59:44.740
<v Speaker 1>do you want to see someone to fly by on </v>
<v Speaker 1>a motorcycle?</v>

1289
00:59:44.750 --> 00:59:46.380
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to see some fly by </v>
<v Speaker 1>another guy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1310
01:00:38.561 --> 01:00:41.830
<v Speaker 1>it was definitely on fire in a car that </v>
<v Speaker 1>accidentally caught on fire.</v>

1311
01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:42.933
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>

1312
01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:43.960
<v Speaker 3>now that you mentioned it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1313
01:00:44.010 --> 01:00:44.970
<v Speaker 3>when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

1314
01:00:44.971 --> 01:00:45.804
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were staying in the UK and we were </v>

1315
01:00:47.491 --> 01:00:50.880
<v Speaker 3>driving a friend's Jaguar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jaguar,</v>

1316
01:00:51.210 --> 01:00:53.010
<v Speaker 3>Jaguar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jaguar,</v>

1317
01:00:53.490 --> 01:00:55.370
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was one of the,</v>

1318
01:00:55.380 --> 01:00:58.440
<v Speaker 3>it was incredibly expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This guy's a multi multimillionaire,</v>

1319
01:00:58.441 --> 01:01:01.140
<v Speaker 3>big star in the UK.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we are driving.</v>

1320
01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:01.993
<v Speaker 3>He lends it to us for a weekend while </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're there and it's the 19 sixties </v>

1321
01:01:05.461 --> 01:01:06.294
<v Speaker 3>vintage thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we go out and drive through the </v>

1322
01:01:08.611 --> 01:01:12.120
<v Speaker 3>countryside and the car catches on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh No.</v>

1323
01:01:12.180 --> 01:01:13.013
<v Speaker 3>So my parents had to pay to restore this</v>
<v Speaker 3>vintage Jaguar and the minute they </v>

1324
01:01:20.210 --> 01:01:23.760
<v Speaker 3>didn't accept responsible for this piece</v>
<v Speaker 3>of shit catching on fire,</v>

1325
01:01:24.330 --> 01:01:27.630
<v Speaker 3>he lent it to us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actually it was more than a weekend.</v>

1326
01:01:27.631 --> 01:01:29.820
<v Speaker 3>He was letting us use it because he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>out of the country.</v>

1327
01:01:29.821 --> 01:01:31.320
<v Speaker 3>I think we were staying there for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>couple of weeks.</v>

1328
01:01:31.321 --> 01:01:33.660
<v Speaker 3>He was letting us use this place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>letting us drive his car.</v>

1329
01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:35.240
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of a deal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1330
01:01:35.260 --> 01:01:35.770
<v Speaker 3>we're not gonna</v>

1331
01:01:35.770 --> 01:01:37.900
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but whatever.</v>

1332
01:01:37.930 --> 01:01:42.140
<v Speaker 1>A car does not catch on fire does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's a 19 sixties vintage Jaguar,</v>

1333
01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:44.840
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't catch on fire because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your fault.</v>

1334
01:01:44.870 --> 01:01:49.520
<v Speaker 1>No sunfire because it's a piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You a piece of shit.</v>

1335
01:01:49.521 --> 01:01:52.460
<v Speaker 1>He knew it was a piece of shit because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in 1960 car.</v>

1336
01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:53.473
<v Speaker 1>You're driving it around and it acted </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a piece of shit and caught on fire </v>

1337
01:01:55.731 --> 01:01:57.800
<v Speaker 1>and then he wants you to pay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have been like,</v>

1338
01:01:57.801 --> 01:02:00.140

<v Speaker 1>How about you get your wires checked and</v>

1339
01:02:00.141 --> 01:02:03.140
<v Speaker 1>I sue you for almost killing me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't have your car.</v>

1340
01:02:03.170 --> 01:02:06.530
<v Speaker 3>He didn't want us to pay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much was it that I don't remember?</v>

1341
01:02:06.531 --> 01:02:08.110
<v Speaker 3>I was a child,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little child,</v>

01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:10.213
<v Speaker 3>It was a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember my parents feeling like it </v>

1344
01:02:11.481 --> 01:02:12.314
<v Speaker 3>was a lot of money and it goes because </v>
<v Speaker 3>like smoke just started pouring out of </v>

<v Speaker 3>the bag</v>

1346
01:02:16.490 --> 01:02:20.880
<v Speaker 1>because it didn't even have a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>fire extinguisher.</v>

1350
01:02:28.141 --> 01:02:28.711
<v Speaker 1>wealthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Your parents weren't rich and expensive.</v>

1352
01:02:31.300 --> 01:02:32.960
<v Speaker 1>Car parents weren't rich.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were not rich.</v>

1353
01:02:33.020 --> 01:02:35.970
<v Speaker 1>Then he made them pay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't make them pay.</v>

1354
01:02:35.971 --> 01:02:39.450
<v Speaker 1>They refused to accept his offer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have to reimburse them.</v>

1355
01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:41.200
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they.</v>

1356

<v Speaker 1>If they insisted on paying.</v>

1357
01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:44.233
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he should've bought them something with </v>

1358
01:02:46.291 --> 01:02:47.430
<v Speaker 1>that money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He probably did,</v>

1359
01:02:47.980 --> 01:02:48.813
<v Speaker 1>but my parents are nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People just stopped going to take money </v>

1360
01:02:53.180 --> 01:02:54.540

<v Speaker 1>of the story,</v>

01:08:05.621 --> 01:08:10.210
<v Speaker 1>So she.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So huffpost was bought by AOL in 2011.</v>

1481
01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:12.280
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>AOL has money.</v>

1482
01:08:12.550 --> 01:08:13.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well basically I will,</v>

1483
01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:16.010
<v Speaker 1>I will actually does have</v>

1484
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:17.780
<v Speaker 3>money because they have some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get money.</v>

1485
01:08:18.290 --> 01:08:19.820
<v Speaker 3>It's really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two ways.</v>

1486
01:08:20.030 --> 01:08:20.863
<v Speaker 3>One is they've got some proprietary add </v>
<v Speaker 3>software which is helpful for websites </v>

1487
01:08:25.250 --> 01:08:26.083
<v Speaker 3>and the second is a lot of people in </v>
<v Speaker 3>America still unknowingly pay for </v>

1488
01:08:29.811 --> 01:08:33.200
<v Speaker 3>AOL.com</v>
<v Speaker 3>because back when they used to sell you,</v>

1489
01:08:33.230 --> 01:08:35.660
<v Speaker 3>well they don't know that they don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to anymore.</v>

1490
01:08:35.661 --> 01:08:37.820
<v Speaker 3>Like when they were in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like in the nineties,</v>

1491
01:08:37.821 --> 01:08:40.430
<v Speaker 3>they would send out cds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Apparently I wasn't here then,</v>

1492
01:08:40.431 --> 01:08:44.990
<v Speaker 3>but the iol was the place where </v>
<v Speaker 3>Americans got online and so those.</v>

1493
01:08:45.230 --> 01:08:49.100
<v Speaker 3>Here we go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two point 1 million CNN money to lose.</v>

1494
01:08:49.190 --> 01:08:53.780
<v Speaker 3>I will dial up and they pay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They pay for that.</v>

1495
01:08:53.930 --> 01:08:55.790
<v Speaker 2>Scroll that down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to read that.</v>

1496
01:08:56.630 --> 01:08:57.463
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seventy percent of Americans are </v>

1497
01:08:59.151 --> 01:09:01.610
<v Speaker 2>connected to the Internet over much </v>
<v Speaker 2>faster broadband,</v>

1498
01:09:01.611 --> 01:09:03.710
<v Speaker 2>the average us broadband speed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah blah blah,</v>

1499
01:09:03.711 --> 01:09:04.220
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>

1500
01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:09.200
<v Speaker 2>200 times faster than the 56 k per </v>
<v Speaker 2>second dial up even smartphones and more</v>

1501
01:09:09.201 --> 01:09:10.760
<v Speaker 2>than 100 times faster than that.</v>

1502
01:09:10.900 --> 01:09:11.733
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the average AOL dial up user is </v>

1503
01:09:13.091 --> 01:09:15.040
<v Speaker 3>paying 20 bucks a month.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

1504
01:09:15.310 --> 01:09:16.500
<v Speaker 3>20 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And managing pain,</v>

1505
01:09:16.580 --> 01:09:18.760
<v Speaker 3>John Upstate should pay you for </v>
<v Speaker 3>dialogue.</v>

1506
01:09:19.690 --> 01:09:20.523
<v Speaker 3>So what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>People that just live in like really </v>

1507
01:09:22.001 --> 01:09:25.960
<v Speaker 3>super rural.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They probably can't get it yet or we can</v>

1508
01:09:25.961 --> 01:09:27.010
<v Speaker 3>get better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

1509
01:09:27.070 --> 01:09:29.320
<v Speaker 3>Or they're just old Hicks and they don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>know better.</v>

1510
01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:32.080
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So she.</v>

1511
01:09:32.081 --> 01:09:35.740
<v Speaker 3>So aol basically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they say that iol bought happened</v>

1512
01:09:35.770 --> 01:09:36.603
<v Speaker 3>in post,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but really it was Ariana essentially </v>

1513
01:09:38.501 --> 01:09:39.334
<v Speaker 3>becoming a senior manager of aol or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever her title was at aol because </v>

1514
01:09:43.991 --> 01:09:46.060
<v Speaker 3>iol had no future and they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1515
01:09:46.061 --> 01:09:48.190
<v Speaker 3>huff post is cool with the kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so let's have,</v>

1516
01:09:48.310 --> 01:09:49.143
<v Speaker 3>let's get in on some of that action.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then last year if a rise and bought AOL </v>

1517
01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:56.390
<v Speaker 3>and in part of that whole shake up the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1518
01:09:56.410 --> 01:09:57.550
<v Speaker 3>she got ousted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1519
01:09:57.640 --> 01:09:58.473
<v Speaker 3>let's be frank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She is eccentric and has her own hobby </v>

1520
01:10:04.061 --> 01:10:07.050
<v Speaker 3>horses like her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean she spends a lot of her time</v>

1521
01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:11.510
<v Speaker 2>boyfriends helping host a thing in </v>
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>

1522
01:10:11.511 --> 01:10:13.820
<v Speaker 2>Is it that term?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I was an old rich lady,</v>

1523
01:10:13.821 --> 01:10:18.080
<v Speaker 2>I'd have some hobby horses though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dudes that need money for the gym.</v>

1524
01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:19.430
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1525
01:10:19.431 --> 01:10:23.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm not implying that duds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And given Viagara and send them over.</v>

1526
01:10:23.330 --> 01:10:25.310
<v Speaker 2>Do you want to fucking Jaguar?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boy,</v>

1527
01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:27.223
<v Speaker 2>get it hard.</v>

1528
01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:29.660
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not a boy toy.</v>

1529
01:10:29.710 --> 01:10:30.543
<v Speaker 3>A hobby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Horses is a hobby that is a personal </v>

1530
01:10:33.161 --> 01:10:36.040
<v Speaker 3>interest that you spend way too much </v>
<v Speaker 3>time on instead of.</v>

1531
01:10:36.100 --> 01:10:37.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it might be.</v>

1532
01:10:37.450 --> 01:10:41.020
<v Speaker 3>It's probably in Australia and she </v>
<v Speaker 3>spends,</v>

1533
01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:41.913
<v Speaker 3>in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she spends a lot of time going around </v>

1534
01:10:42.461 --> 01:10:44.410
<v Speaker 3>the world giving speeches about why you </v>
<v Speaker 3>should get more sleep.</v>

1535
01:10:45.070 --> 01:10:47.140
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's begun to sleep.</v>

1536
01:10:48.220 --> 01:10:49.660
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We read a whole book about it.</v>

1537
01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:52.270
<v Speaker 3>How much sleep do you need?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She read a whole book.</v>

1538
01:10:52.660 --> 01:10:53.470
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

1539
01:10:53.470 --> 01:10:54.131
<v Speaker 3>And it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All it is,</v>

1540
01:10:54.131 --> 01:10:54.964
<v Speaker 3>is one of those books where you </v>
<v Speaker 3>basically know in the first page what </v>

1541
01:10:57.191 --> 01:10:58.024
<v Speaker 3>the whole book is going to be with them </v>
<v Speaker 3>and just pat out the remaining hundred </v>

1542
01:10:59.550 --> 01:11:00.820
<v Speaker 3>80 pages.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one of those,</v>

1543
01:11:01.210 --> 01:11:02.043
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

1544
01:11:02.100 --> 01:11:06.210
<v Speaker 2>And it's just about how much you need to</v>
<v Speaker 2>recover or get enough sleep.</v>

1545
01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:12.840
<v Speaker 2>I think Dan shine it is the sleep </v>
<v Speaker 2>revolution live.</v>

1546
01:11:13.110 --> 01:11:14.430
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're rich</v>

1547
01:11:14.490 --> 01:11:16.920
<v Speaker 4>lady.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most people aren't rich.</v>

1548
01:11:16.921 --> 01:11:18.930
<v Speaker 4>They can't fucking sleep all time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bitch.</v>

1549
01:11:22.020 --> 01:11:22.853
<v Speaker 1>The sleep revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many fucking people I know that are </v>

1550
01:11:25.451 --> 01:11:27.790
<v Speaker 1>participating in that revolution </v>
<v Speaker 1>unknowingly,</v>

1551
01:11:30.310 --> 01:11:32.380
<v Speaker 1>comics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comics,</v>

1552
01:11:32.381 --> 01:11:34.590
<v Speaker 1>while fucking call them before noon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They believed,</v>

1553
01:11:34.610 --> 01:11:35.550
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why'd you call?</v>

1554
01:11:35.610 --> 01:11:36.640
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1555
01:11:36.810 --> 01:11:38.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it were up to me,</v>

1556
01:11:38.651 --> 01:11:40.900
<v Speaker 1>I would stay up very late and get up </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty late as well.</v>

1557
01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:43.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean some people are just like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt bad about it and then I found out</v>

1558
01:11:43.871 --> 01:11:45.520
<v Speaker 1>that Sam Harris and Tim Ferris do it as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

1559
01:11:45.521 --> 01:11:46.271
<v Speaker 1>So fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

1560
01:11:46.271 --> 01:11:48.250
<v Speaker 1>They stay up late and go to bed and get </v>
<v Speaker 1>up late.</v>

1561
01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:49.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1562
01:11:49.301 --> 01:11:51.640
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll get my best work done late at night</v>

1563
01:11:51.670 --> 01:11:55.370
<v Speaker 1>when everyone's asleep and I almost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I almost feel like</v>

1564
01:11:55.420 --> 01:11:58.210
<v Speaker 4>it sounds so woo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this is what I believe.</v>

1565
01:11:58.460 --> 01:12:01.060
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe there's a different feeling to</v>

1566
01:12:01.061 --> 01:12:02.920
<v Speaker 4>the air at like two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>3:00</v>

1567
01:12:02.921 --> 01:12:03.754
<v Speaker 4>in the morning because almost everyone </v>
<v Speaker 4>is asleep and I feel like there's less </v>

1568
01:12:06.521 --> 01:12:09.580
<v Speaker 4>signal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you get something from people.</v>

1569
01:12:09.670 --> 01:12:12.970
<v Speaker 4>I think if there's an intangible quality</v>
<v Speaker 4>that people exude,</v>

1570
01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:17.440
<v Speaker 4>that people expressed that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>broadcast and when you're around them,</v>

1571
01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:18.513
<v Speaker 4>that's why certain people have bad </v>
<v Speaker 4>energy and certain people have good </v>

1572
01:12:20.501 --> 01:12:22.870
<v Speaker 4>energy and some people are warm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some people are weird.</v>

1573
01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:27.820
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a thing that we don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>know how to quantify and that it's about</v>

1574
01:12:27.821 --> 01:12:32.821
<v Speaker 4>people and I think that is entirely </v>
<v Speaker 4>possible if there's a hum of a city,</v>

1575
01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:35.260
<v Speaker 4>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1576
01:12:35.260 --> 01:12:36.093
<v Speaker 4>like a literally a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a feeling that you get when a bunch of </v>

1577
01:12:38.921 --> 01:12:39.754
<v Speaker 4>people are thinking and awake and </v>
<v Speaker 4>conscious and you get a different </v>

1578
01:12:43.150 --> 01:12:43.983
<v Speaker 4>expression when those people are asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I know that when I'm writing at </v>

1579
01:12:47.881 --> 01:12:48.491
<v Speaker 4>two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>3:00</v>

1580
01:12:48.491 --> 01:12:50.230
<v Speaker 4>in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is when I do my best work,</v>

1581
01:12:50.650 --> 01:12:55.650
<v Speaker 4>everybody else's conked out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I feel like I have more clarity.</v>

1582
01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:58.540
<v Speaker 4>I feel like I have more peace and I can </v>
<v Speaker 4>write better,</v>

1583
01:12:58.990 --> 01:13:02.860
<v Speaker 4>might be total bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there might be something to it.</v>

1584
01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:04.571
<v Speaker 4>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is.</v>

1585
01:13:04.571 --> 01:13:06.250
<v Speaker 4>We were totally right.</v>

1586
01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:11.220
<v Speaker 1>It's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also possible that there are visual</v>

1587
01:13:11.221 --> 01:13:13.440
<v Speaker 1>and auditory cues that just make it </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel,</v>

1588
01:13:13.441 --> 01:13:15.870
<v Speaker 1>make you feel like here in a special </v>
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>

1589
01:13:15.871 --> 01:13:16.710
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's dark.</v>

1590
01:13:16.711 --> 01:13:18.060
<v Speaker 1>There's no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no one moving.</v>

1591
01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:21.430
<v Speaker 1>There's no one making noises.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's another reason why I might</v>

1592
01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:24.360
<v Speaker 4>be interested in believing that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not what you're saying,</v>

1593
01:13:24.361 --> 01:13:26.850
<v Speaker 4>but what I'm saying this because when I </v>
<v Speaker 4>go on these camping trips,</v>

1594
01:13:27.210 --> 01:13:28.980
<v Speaker 4>hunting trips where no cell phone </v>
<v Speaker 4>service,</v>

1595
01:13:29.190 --> 01:13:32.130
<v Speaker 4>there's a very different feeling to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world when there's no service.</v>

1596
01:13:32.190 --> 01:13:34.320
<v Speaker 4>You feel different like do you feel</v>

1597
01:13:34.380 --> 01:13:36.160
<v Speaker 1>wait when your cell phone has no </v>
<v Speaker 1>service,</v>

1598
01:13:36.161 --> 01:13:38.170
<v Speaker 1>no cell phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no Internet,</v>

1599
01:13:38.171 --> 01:13:41.230
<v Speaker 1>no signals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no nothing that would the.</v>

1600
01:13:41.290 --> 01:13:42.123
<v Speaker 1>How would the thinking hum of a human </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind get transmitted through to your </v>

1601
01:13:45.521 --> 01:13:46.330
<v Speaker 1>phone?</v>

1602
01:13:46.330 --> 01:13:47.163
<v Speaker 4>Not to your phone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying it gets transmitted to </v>

1603
01:13:48.941 --> 01:13:52.450
<v Speaker 4>your phone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm thinking that there are signals that</v>

1604
01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:55.000
<v Speaker 4>you are receiving all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like in this room,</v>

1605
01:13:55.001 --> 01:13:57.290
<v Speaker 4>we have wifi there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cell phone,</v>

1606
01:13:57.500 --> 01:13:58.333
<v Speaker 1>there's radio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of shit in the air and </v>

1607
01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:02.960
<v Speaker 1>there's just all of those waves somehow </v>
<v Speaker 1>resonate.</v>

1608
01:14:03.020 --> 01:14:05.120
<v Speaker 1>You can send them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you can,</v>

1609
01:14:05.121 --> 01:14:07.220
<v Speaker 1>but I know my computer can and I know my</v>
<v Speaker 1>phone,</v>

1610
01:14:07.380 --> 01:14:11.770
<v Speaker 1>but do you think you can sense the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mental states of human beings?</v>

1611
01:14:11.771 --> 01:14:11.980
<v Speaker 1>Which is</v>

1612
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:12.813
<v Speaker 3>what I thought you were saying</v>

1613
01:14:12.820 --> 01:14:13.653
<v Speaker 4>it was what I was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm thinking that there's more than </v>

1614
01:14:15.761 --> 01:14:16.594
<v Speaker 4>one kind of signal that is being </v>
<v Speaker 4>expressed not just by people but by </v>

1615
01:14:21.311 --> 01:14:23.860
<v Speaker 4>society in general.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The hum of the city,</v>

1616
01:14:23.861 --> 01:14:25.100
<v Speaker 4>the buzz,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the like,</v>

1617
01:14:25.130 --> 01:14:25.963
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that feeling that you get of New York </v>

1618
01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:28.390
<v Speaker 4>City,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it's a lie.</v>

1619
01:14:28.450 --> 01:14:29.283
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>

1620
01:14:29.290 --> 01:14:30.123
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if that's not because you're </v>

1621
01:14:31.811 --> 01:14:36.811
<v Speaker 4>dealing with 7 million people stuffed </v>
<v Speaker 4>into this little tiny areas.</v>

1622
01:14:37.540 --> 01:14:38.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely.</v>

1623
01:14:38.730 --> 01:14:41.460
<v Speaker 3>It's definitely that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The question is what is the transmission</v>

1624
01:14:41.461 --> 01:14:44.850
<v Speaker 3>mechanism by which that presence makes </v>
<v Speaker 3>itself known?</v>

1625
01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:45.660
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of.</v>

1626
01:14:45.660 --> 01:14:46.493
<v Speaker 3>I totally know what you mean about </v>
<v Speaker 3>campaign because one of the most </v>

1627
01:14:49.201 --> 01:14:54.201
<v Speaker 3>beautiful places that I could ever be is</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the outback at night.</v>

1628
01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:57.870
<v Speaker 3>Nothing around for miles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love desserts.</v>

1629
01:14:57.990 --> 01:14:59.490
<v Speaker 3>I love,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1630
01:14:59.491 --> 01:15:03.480
<v Speaker 3>I drove through Nevada once and I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>done a couple of trips around Australia,</v>

1631
01:15:03.990 --> 01:15:04.823
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Deep into the middle of nowhere and </v>

1632
01:15:06.121 --> 01:15:11.121
<v Speaker 3>there's just something so I mean for </v>
<v Speaker 3>start the blazing sky of stars so bright</v>

1633
01:15:13.410 --> 01:15:14.243
<v Speaker 3>that if anyone hasn't seen them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would not believe that this guy </v>

1634
01:15:16.171 --> 01:15:21.150
<v Speaker 3>could be that bright and then the Shia </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientists silence so silent.</v>

1635
01:15:21.151 --> 01:15:23.670
<v Speaker 3>It's just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost a noise in itself.</v>

1636
01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:27.240
<v Speaker 3>It's almost a deafening noise in the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In the absence of noise.</v>

1637
01:15:27.430 --> 01:15:29.230
<v Speaker 4>It's not just a silence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1638
01:15:29.250 --> 01:15:33.120
<v Speaker 4>I feel like it's an absence of signal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a silence and an absence of signal.</v>

1639
01:15:33.121 --> 01:15:36.240
<v Speaker 4>I think we've become accustomed to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>signal of a city,</v>

1640
01:15:36.390 --> 01:15:40.290
<v Speaker 4>the signal of all the people and all the</v>
<v Speaker 4>things that are being broadcasted around</v>

1641
01:15:40.291 --> 01:15:41.124
<v Speaker 4>us and all the waves and all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>different shit that we're we're </v>

1642
01:15:43.951 --> 01:15:47.370
<v Speaker 4>experiencing unknowingly might be </v>
<v Speaker 4>bullshit,</v>

1643
01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:48.500
<v Speaker 4>but it might.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's.</v>

1644
01:15:48.530 --> 01:15:50.970
<v Speaker 4>There's people that are concerned with </v>
<v Speaker 4>Wifi.</v>

1645
01:15:51.300 --> 01:15:52.133
<v Speaker 4>They're concerned with Wifi because </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's not a long history of us using </v>

1646
01:15:55.051 --> 01:15:55.884
<v Speaker 4>Wifi or even sell cellular signals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We know for a fact that they interfere </v>

1647
01:15:59.581 --> 01:16:01.140
<v Speaker 4>with bees.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bees,</v>

1648
01:16:01.141 --> 01:16:04.560
<v Speaker 4>a form of communication.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It gets interfered with by Cell Towers,</v>

1649
01:16:04.890 --> 01:16:07.650
<v Speaker 4>cell towers and cell phone signals in </v>
<v Speaker 4>general,</v>

1650
01:16:08.210 --> 01:16:11.190
<v Speaker 4>and that all these signals that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>flying through the air that are reaching</v>

1651
01:16:11.191 --> 01:16:13.080
<v Speaker 4>your and my phones and everyone else's </v>
<v Speaker 4>phones,</v>

1652
01:16:13.090 --> 01:16:17.640
<v Speaker 4>so the bees are actually taking these </v>
<v Speaker 4>things into just imagine the world where</v>

1653
01:16:17.641 --> 01:16:20.730
<v Speaker 4>bees before the 19 nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're like hanging out,</v>

1654
01:16:20.731 --> 01:16:24.060
<v Speaker 4>having a great time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but communicating with each other,</v>

1655
01:16:24.061 --> 01:16:26.140
<v Speaker 4>but those businesses and then all of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>sudden they're here,</v>

1656
01:16:26.141 --> 01:16:30.150
<v Speaker 4>a Jackhammer in the background.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what the fuck is that?</v>

1657
01:16:30.420 --> 01:16:31.060
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1658
01:16:31.060 --> 01:16:31.893
<v Speaker 3>I think this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they think that Sona is one explanation </v>

1659
01:16:34.081 --> 01:16:38.240
<v Speaker 3>for why wiles beach themselves and why </v>
<v Speaker 3>so many migratory patterns underwater as</v>

1660
01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:39.223
<v Speaker 3>fucked up as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you heard that theory doesn't make </v>

1661
01:16:41.270 --> 01:16:41.760
<v Speaker 3>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1662
01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:42.120
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1663
01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:43.950
<v Speaker 3>the military and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1664
01:16:44.310 --> 01:16:46.690
<v Speaker 3>the US military does all kinds of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1665
01:16:46.740 --> 01:16:48.510
<v Speaker 3>I don't even,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember the name of it,</v>

1666
01:16:48.511 --> 01:16:50.600
<v Speaker 3>but long distance sona so that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1667
01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:52.320
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really reaching out.</v>

1668
01:16:52.321 --> 01:16:54.900
<v Speaker 3>Part of the spying system I think is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

1669
01:16:55.340 --> 01:16:56.940
<v Speaker 3>it might not be sonar maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but anyway,</v>

1670
01:16:56.941 --> 01:16:59.990
<v Speaker 3>the gist of this is correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if the details are not that they,</v>

1671
01:17:00.050 --> 01:17:01.900
<v Speaker 3>they basically blanket,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1672
01:17:02.310 --> 01:17:03.143
<v Speaker 3>hundreds or thousands of miles of ocean </v>
<v Speaker 3>in these things that we can't hear that </v>

1673
01:17:06.481 --> 01:17:08.810
<v Speaker 3>we thought had no impact on anything but</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can,</v>

1674
01:17:08.850 --> 01:17:11.060
<v Speaker 3>but you can notice behavioral changes </v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1675
01:17:11.150 --> 01:17:11.983
<v Speaker 3>in Wiles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just vast distances away from these </v>

1676
01:17:14.571 --> 01:17:16.280
<v Speaker 3>submarines that are conducting these </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

1677
01:17:16.460 --> 01:17:17.293
<v Speaker 3>So it's entirely conceivable that with </v>
<v Speaker 3>bees and other animals are tuned into </v>

1678
01:17:20.751 --> 01:17:21.584
<v Speaker 3>things that were not tuned into.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the thing I love about getting </v>

1679
01:17:25.551 --> 01:17:28.970
<v Speaker 3>away from all that is like the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>

1680
01:17:29.030 --> 01:17:31.700
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you find this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I find that the first day,</v>

1681
01:17:32.180 --> 01:17:33.013
<v Speaker 3>the absence of all of that can seem a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit irritating in some way or a </v>

1682
01:17:35.721 --> 01:17:38.660
<v Speaker 3>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's nothing to do.</v>

1683
01:17:38.690 --> 01:17:41.600
<v Speaker 3>Like I feel sort of fidgety when I first</v>
<v Speaker 3>go to the desert.</v>

1684
01:17:41.790 --> 01:17:43.470
<v Speaker 4>That's why you got to go hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but.</v>

1685
01:17:43.740 --> 01:17:44.573
<v Speaker 4>Well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that'd be great to have a very primal </v>

1686
01:17:46.831 --> 01:17:48.070
<v Speaker 4>task in front of you show up.</v>

1687
01:17:48.530 --> 01:17:50.500
<v Speaker 3>But I mean after three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>four,</v>

1688
01:17:50.510 --> 01:17:51.343
<v Speaker 3>five days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you use your pace just slows down </v>

1689
01:17:54.651 --> 01:17:55.484
<v Speaker 3>into.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It almost makes me feel some kind of </v>

1690
01:17:56.751 --> 01:17:57.584
<v Speaker 3>kinship to aborigines or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like people who are a lot more </v>

1691
01:18:00.381 --> 01:18:03.220
<v Speaker 3>connected to land and New York City,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1692
01:18:03.570 --> 01:18:06.620
<v Speaker 3>and you get into it just a different </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of headspace,</v>

1693
01:18:06.660 --> 01:18:11.030
<v Speaker 3>different relationship to the earth and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the soil and the sky and all that.</v>

1694
01:18:11.031 --> 01:18:12.260
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it sounds very hippy dippy,</v>

1695
01:18:12.261 --> 01:18:13.940
<v Speaker 3>but you can definitely feel it when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're there.</v>

1696
01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:15.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It does sound Hippie Dippie,</v>

1697
01:18:15.631 --> 01:18:16.464
<v Speaker 4>but I think you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's something going on and I think </v>

1698
01:18:18.361 --> 01:18:20.310
<v Speaker 4>there's something going on that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>natural.</v>

1699
01:18:20.340 --> 01:18:21.040
<v Speaker 4>When you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

1700
01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:23.100
<v Speaker 4>you're disconnected from all this </v>
<v Speaker 4>unnatural stuff.</v>

1701
01:18:23.101 --> 01:18:25.320
<v Speaker 4>They're so attractive to us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1702
01:18:25.321 --> 01:18:26.154
<v Speaker 4>the reason why you're seeing these </v>
<v Speaker 4>people at dinner all touching their </v>

1703
01:18:28.501 --> 01:18:31.320
<v Speaker 4>phones and playing with their phones,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something is happening to them,</v>

1704
01:18:31.321 --> 01:18:33.480
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's some sort of compelling thing.</v>

1705
01:18:33.660 --> 01:18:35.520
<v Speaker 4>It's not like they're that compelled to </v>
<v Speaker 4>read,</v>

1706
01:18:35.550 --> 01:18:39.390
<v Speaker 4>like have a diamond from them because if</v>
<v Speaker 4>you had books in front of these people,</v>

1707
01:18:39.391 --> 01:18:40.224
<v Speaker 4>would they be fucking with those books?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And same with the reading people's </v>

1708
01:18:41.641 --> 01:18:42.390
<v Speaker 4>tweets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1709
01:18:42.390 --> 01:18:44.140
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They will focus</v>

1710
01:18:44.140 --> 01:18:46.190
<v Speaker 3>and concentration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the,</v>

1711
01:18:46.230 --> 01:18:47.063
<v Speaker 3>this is the big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is where there's a book called the </v>

1712
01:18:49.331 --> 01:18:50.164
<v Speaker 3>shallows by a can't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did a segment on this discovery </v>

1713
01:18:54.101 --> 01:18:57.040
<v Speaker 3>science channel show called based on his</v>
<v Speaker 3>google making a stupid,</v>

1714
01:18:57.041 --> 01:18:58.470
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you know that book?</v>

1715
01:18:58.790 --> 01:19:00.610
<v Speaker 3>There's a book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is Google making us stupid?</v>

1716
01:19:00.970 --> 01:19:04.330
<v Speaker 3>And there's this kind of ideological </v>
<v Speaker 3>battle between these two guys.</v>

1717
01:19:04.331 --> 01:19:06.970
<v Speaker 3>I come up with their names.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of them is Nicholas,</v>

1718
01:19:07.100 --> 01:19:11.860
<v Speaker 3>someone about the question of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is all of this technological input,</v>

1719
01:19:12.010 --> 01:19:12.880
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1720
01:19:12.881 --> 01:19:13.714
<v Speaker 3>making a smarter because we've got so </v>
<v Speaker 3>much more data at our fingertips and </v>

1721
01:19:15.971 --> 01:19:17.740
<v Speaker 3>we're so much more nimble </v>
<v Speaker 3>intellectually,</v>

1722
01:19:18.100 --> 01:19:22.150
<v Speaker 3>or is it making us more stupid because </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're more reliant on outside sources of</v>

1723
01:19:22.151 --> 01:19:23.800
<v Speaker 3>data.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't have to remember things anymore</v>

1724
01:19:23.801 --> 01:19:24.634
<v Speaker 3>and we're constantly skipping across the</v>
<v Speaker 3>surface of information instead of </v>

1725
01:19:26.621 --> 01:19:27.820
<v Speaker 3>digging down into it.</v>

1726
01:19:28.210 --> 01:19:30.970
<v Speaker 3>And I think it's an interesting question</v>
<v Speaker 3>about you say,</v>

1727
01:19:30.971 --> 01:19:32.980
<v Speaker 3>would those people be reading books will</v>
<v Speaker 3>know?</v>

1728
01:19:33.010 --> 01:19:37.030
<v Speaker 3>And do they even read as many books as </v>
<v Speaker 3>they would have if you know,</v>

1729
01:19:37.270 --> 01:19:38.103
<v Speaker 3>if they'd lived 100 years ago?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because an argument can be made that </v>

1730
01:19:41.921 --> 01:19:44.020
<v Speaker 3>were really good these days at </v>
<v Speaker 3>multitasking.</v>

1731
01:19:44.021 --> 01:19:46.810
<v Speaker 3>We're really good at jumping from </v>
<v Speaker 3>facebook to twitter to the next thing to</v>

1732
01:19:46.830 --> 01:19:47.680
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm writing something,</v>

1733
01:19:47.681 --> 01:19:50.470
<v Speaker 3>but then a little egg email pops up and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then a text message comes through,</v>

1734
01:19:50.650 --> 01:19:52.810
<v Speaker 3>so I'm constantly distracted and </v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly busy,</v>

1735
01:19:52.811 --> 01:19:56.620
<v Speaker 3>but there's that old line of a company </v>
<v Speaker 3>who said it,</v>

1736
01:19:56.980 --> 01:19:59.680
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're busy and a busy,</v>

1737
01:20:00.010 --> 01:20:01.500
<v Speaker 3>but what's the point?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1738
01:20:01.510 --> 01:20:03.580
<v Speaker 3>Like what are you up to?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you doing?</v>

1739
01:20:03.581 --> 01:20:05.770
<v Speaker 3>What are you being productive and being </v>
<v Speaker 3>efficient?</v>

1740
01:20:05.771 --> 01:20:07.710
<v Speaker 3>Are you achieving anything that's really</v>
<v Speaker 3>important to you?</v>

1741
01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:08.903
<v Speaker 3>Buisiness is is the scourge of modern </v>
<v Speaker 3>life in a way because it gives you a </v>

1742
01:20:13.861 --> 01:20:17.490
<v Speaker 3>fake way of feeling like you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>something when you're actually,</v>

1743
01:20:17.580 --> 01:20:19.860
<v Speaker 3>when you're actually not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the argument is,</v>

1744
01:20:20.310 --> 01:20:21.143
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're better at juggling all this shit </v>

1745
01:20:22.051 --> 01:20:24.210
<v Speaker 3>than someone in the 18 hundreds would've</v>
<v Speaker 3>been would've been,</v>

1746
01:20:24.930 --> 01:20:29.640
<v Speaker 3>but our way is capable of having the </v>
<v Speaker 3>patience to read Dostoevsky.</v>

1747
01:20:29.670 --> 01:20:31.480
<v Speaker 3>Could you read Moby Dick?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't like.</v>

1748
01:20:31.500 --> 01:20:32.333
<v Speaker 3>Do people sit down and really devote </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves to a deep dive rather than </v>

1749
01:20:36.721 --> 01:20:37.554
<v Speaker 3>just an across the surface horizontal?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you put that thing down for a little </v>

1750
01:20:40.831 --> 01:20:43.480
<v Speaker 3>bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can buy my business.</v>

1751
01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:45.330
<v Speaker 3>Does it disincline you to doing that?</v>

1752
01:20:45.630 --> 01:20:48.540
<v Speaker 4>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think something's going on and I think</v>

1753
01:20:48.541 --> 01:20:49.374
<v Speaker 4>something's going on that we haven't </v>
<v Speaker 4>quite recognized yet and I think one of </v>

1754
01:20:51.601 --> 01:20:52.434
<v Speaker 4>the things that's going on with cell </v>
<v Speaker 4>phones is this as a step towards this </v>

1755
01:20:56.071 --> 01:20:56.904
<v Speaker 4>symbiotic relationship that we're going </v>
<v Speaker 4>to have with computers and Internet and </v>

1756
01:21:01.110 --> 01:21:01.943
<v Speaker 4>communication and what we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about with virtual reality is a part of </v>

1757
01:21:04.351 --> 01:21:07.350
<v Speaker 4>that and it's all becoming more and more</v>
<v Speaker 4>integrated,</v>

1758
01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:10.200
<v Speaker 4>more and more invasive and more and more</v>
<v Speaker 4>prevalent.</v>

1759
01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:12.930
<v Speaker 4>And I think what we're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I've said this time and time again,</v>

1760
01:21:12.931 --> 01:21:14.670
<v Speaker 4>so forgive me if you've heard this </v>
<v Speaker 4>before.</v>

1761
01:21:15.090 --> 01:21:15.923
<v Speaker 4>Other people who are listening,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we are a caterpillar that is </v>

1762
01:21:20.161 --> 01:21:23.220
<v Speaker 4>giving birth to some sort of an </v>
<v Speaker 4>electronic butterfly.</v>

1763
01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:26.820
<v Speaker 4>I think we are going to become something</v>
<v Speaker 4>different and I think this is a step.</v>

1764
01:21:26.821 --> 01:21:27.654
<v Speaker 4>I think we're building a cocoon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're building an electronic cocoon by </v>

1765
01:21:30.780 --> 01:21:35.780
<v Speaker 4>encompassing and engrossing ourselves in</v>
<v Speaker 4>these electronic aids,</v>

1766
01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:41.130
<v Speaker 4>these things that were connecting to </v>
<v Speaker 4>constantly all day.</v>

1767
01:21:41.420 --> 01:21:42.253
<v Speaker 4>We are getting more and more attached </v>
<v Speaker 4>them to the point where the other day I </v>

1768
01:21:45.211 --> 01:21:49.370
<v Speaker 4>left my phone in my house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I drove down the street and panicked and</v>

1769
01:21:49.380 --> 01:21:51.950
<v Speaker 4>how a you turn turn right back around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How's this going to be?</v>

1770
01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:54.390
<v Speaker 4>I was just kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was just going to go to the store real</v>

1771
01:21:54.391 --> 01:21:54.970
<v Speaker 4>quick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1772
01:21:54.970 --> 01:21:56.220
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't do without my phone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1773
01:21:56.221 --> 01:21:57.054
<v Speaker 4>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My phone turned around and that feeling </v>

1774
01:21:59.131 --> 01:22:00.750
<v Speaker 4>is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a weird feeling.</v>

1775
01:22:00.780 --> 01:22:01.613
<v Speaker 4>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a strange feeling and I think that </v>

1776
01:22:03.121 --> 01:22:03.954
<v Speaker 4>that feeling is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's something I think is a natural </v>

1777
01:22:07.711 --> 01:22:08.544
<v Speaker 4>thing that we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that as technology becomes more </v>

1778
01:22:11.551 --> 01:22:12.384
<v Speaker 4>and more innovative and it more and more</v>
<v Speaker 4>powerful and it can do more and more </v>

1779
01:22:16.861 --> 01:22:17.694
<v Speaker 4>things for you and connect you to more </v>
<v Speaker 4>and more people and more and more </v>

1780
01:22:21.061 --> 01:22:25.830
<v Speaker 4>different and involving ways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's going to eventually lead to</v>

1781
01:22:25.831 --> 01:22:26.664
<v Speaker 4>the next step and that next step is some</v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of an integration of it into your </v>

1782
01:22:30.811 --> 01:22:31.644
<v Speaker 4>biology.</v>

1783
01:22:32.030 --> 01:22:32.863
<v Speaker 3>I want to get to that in one second </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I've said that to me before and </v>

1784
01:22:35.091 --> 01:22:35.924
<v Speaker 3>I think it's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm on the question of leaving your </v>

1785
01:22:37.761 --> 01:22:40.940
<v Speaker 3>phone at home and freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean another.</v>

1786
01:22:40.941 --> 01:22:42.200
<v Speaker 3>This comes back to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1787
01:22:42.350 --> 01:22:43.183
<v Speaker 3>the anecdote that I was telling you </v>
<v Speaker 3>earlier about the friend of a friend </v>

1788
01:22:45.231 --> 01:22:49.430
<v Speaker 3>who's a comic who's gotten rid of his </v>
<v Speaker 3>phone because I love podcasts.</v>

1789
01:22:49.460 --> 01:22:51.260
<v Speaker 3>I listen to podcasts all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>love your show,</v>

1790
01:22:51.261 --> 01:22:56.180
<v Speaker 3>love a whole bunch of different of </v>
<v Speaker 3>different shows and I will habitually be</v>

1791
01:22:56.540 --> 01:22:58.400
<v Speaker 3>listening to a podcast while I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>brushing my teeth,</v>

1792
01:22:58.401 --> 01:23:00.860
<v Speaker 3>listening to a podcast while I'm driving</v>
<v Speaker 3>around,</v>

1793
01:23:00.861 --> 01:23:01.341
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

1794
01:23:01.341 --> 01:23:03.320
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And today,</v>

1795
01:23:03.430 --> 01:23:04.850
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was interviewing Andy Kindler,</v>

1796
01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:06.490
<v Speaker 3>they comic for my podcast</v>

1797
01:23:06.790 --> 01:23:07.623
<v Speaker 1>and he like literally he was downstairs </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the hotel where I was staying and </v>

1798
01:23:13.930 --> 01:23:14.763
<v Speaker 1>just to go down and pick him up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had exited the room without my phone </v>

1799
01:23:19.271 --> 01:23:22.030
<v Speaker 1>to listen to a podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I walked back into my room,</v>

1800
01:23:22.380 --> 01:23:24.990
<v Speaker 1>open the podcast app on my phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put my earphones in,</v>

1801
01:23:25.030 --> 01:23:28.240
<v Speaker 1>find the podcast that I was listening to</v>
<v Speaker 1>waste like 25 seconds,</v>

1802
01:23:28.870 --> 01:23:33.870
<v Speaker 1>one minute task because heaven forbid I </v>
<v Speaker 1>should go outside and get in an elevator</v>

1803
01:23:34.450 --> 01:23:37.960
<v Speaker 1>and go down and meet Andy kindler </v>
<v Speaker 1>without listening to what?</v>

1804
01:23:38.290 --> 01:23:39.123
<v Speaker 1>Fifty five fucking seconds of the latest</v>
<v Speaker 1>radio lab episode that I have to listen </v>

1805
01:23:42.401 --> 01:23:44.170
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How dumb am I?</v>

1806
01:23:44.200 --> 01:23:48.880
<v Speaker 1>How distracted do I need to be by people</v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking in my ears or conscious?</v>

1807
01:23:48.881 --> 01:23:53.230
<v Speaker 1>Be with myself for an elevator ride from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the seventh floor in your defense,</v>

1808
01:23:53.260 --> 01:23:54.093
<v Speaker 1>how engaged are you in this wonderful </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast where you're gaining all this </v>

1809
01:23:57.251 --> 01:23:59.320
<v Speaker 1>knowledge and it's fascinating and </v>
<v Speaker 1>intriguing?</v>

1810
01:23:59.320 --> 01:24:00.460
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to let it go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you,</v>

1811
01:24:00.461 --> 01:24:01.790
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel better.</v>

1812
01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.470
<v Speaker 1>How much do I owe you for this session?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1813
01:24:05.550 --> 01:24:07.990
<v Speaker 1>so being a friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we are,</v>

1814
01:24:07.991 --> 01:24:11.920
<v Speaker 1>if we are building a cocoon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the butterfly,</v>

1815
01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:13.353
<v Speaker 1>artificial intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And do we play a role because we become </v>

1816
01:24:17.471 --> 01:24:19.030
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Kurzweil will say,</v>

1817
01:24:19.031 --> 01:24:19.800
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So occurs.</v>

1818
01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:20.633
<v Speaker 1>Kurzweil will say that the artificial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>until the whole question of artificial </v>

1819
01:24:22.751 --> 01:24:27.160
<v Speaker 1>intelligence is slightly a red herring </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we will be become the artificial</v>

1820
01:24:27.161 --> 01:24:29.590
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We will unify ourselves with machines in</v>

1821
01:24:29.591 --> 01:24:33.300
<v Speaker 1>such a way that human intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that biological intelligence,</v>

1822
01:24:33.350 --> 01:24:35.710
<v Speaker 1>artificial intelligence become </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially indistinguishable.</v>

1823
01:24:36.070 --> 01:24:39.370
<v Speaker 1>I think it's possible that that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also think it's possible that we could</v>

1824
01:24:39.371 --> 01:24:40.450
<v Speaker 1>have both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could.</v>

1825
01:24:40.451 --> 01:24:41.284
<v Speaker 1>We could literally have artificial life </v>
<v Speaker 1>forms that we've created along with us </v>

1826
01:24:44.561 --> 01:24:45.394
<v Speaker 1>being inter connected with some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a computer that enhances our </v>

1827
01:24:49.781 --> 01:24:53.200
<v Speaker 1>intelligence that we carry with us </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere or that as a part of our body</v>

1828
01:24:53.430 --> 01:24:57.460
<v Speaker 1>and then it becomes something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kurzweil's talked about these computers,</v>

1829
01:24:57.461 --> 01:25:00.040
<v Speaker 1>these nano computers that are as small </v>
<v Speaker 1>as red blood cells,</v>

1830
01:25:00.041 --> 01:25:00.874
<v Speaker 1>so they're going to inject into our </v>
<v Speaker 1>bloodstream to find cancer and other </v>

1831
01:25:02.710 --> 01:25:03.760
<v Speaker 1>diseases and all these things.</v>

1832
01:25:04.060 --> 01:25:06.790
<v Speaker 1>I think it is entirely possible that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something like that.</v>

1833
01:25:06.791 --> 01:25:09.610
<v Speaker 1>I was going to enhance intelligence and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to have something that</v>

1834
01:25:09.611 --> 01:25:10.444
<v Speaker 1>you can inject into your body and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be like Lucy from that scarlet </v>

1835
01:25:12.971 --> 01:25:13.804
<v Speaker 1>Johannson moving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not outside the realm of </v>

1836
01:25:15.731 --> 01:25:16.564
<v Speaker 1>possibility that both things can happen </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the same time that you could have a </v>

1837
01:25:20.350 --> 01:25:21.183
<v Speaker 1>literal artificial intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that is created by a person </v>

1838
01:25:25.241 --> 01:25:27.780
<v Speaker 1>that can think and talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you see x Mokena?</v>

1839
01:25:27.860 --> 01:25:28.720
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Loved it.</v>

1840
01:25:28.970 --> 01:25:31.330
<v Speaker 1>Actually interviewed both of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1841
01:25:31.331 --> 01:25:34.660
<v Speaker 1>the actives and also the writer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the writer of that,</v>

1842
01:25:34.661 --> 01:25:35.494
<v Speaker 1>Alex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1843
01:25:36.130 --> 01:25:36.963
<v Speaker 1>I forget his name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but very interesting guy grappling with </v>

1844
01:25:38.951 --> 01:25:41.080
<v Speaker 1>a lot of these big issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1845
01:25:41.081 --> 01:25:44.230
<v Speaker 1>he's genuinely motivated by and </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in the whole question of what</v>

1846
01:25:44.231 --> 01:25:46.230
<v Speaker 1>it means to be conscious and self aware.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1847
01:25:46.270 --> 01:25:47.530
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazing movie,</v>

1848
01:25:47.770 --> 01:25:48.880
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1849
01:25:49.030 --> 01:25:50.830
<v Speaker 1>that's possible too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That kind of thing.</v>

1850
01:25:50.831 --> 01:25:53.980
<v Speaker 1>Where are you going to make a fake human</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1851
01:25:53.981 --> 01:25:54.814
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could be confined like they were in </v>

1852
01:25:56.561 --> 01:25:57.394
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a way where it didn't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>the option to access the worldwide web </v>

1853
01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:04.100
<v Speaker 1>and nor did it have the option to </v>
<v Speaker 1>exponentially</v>

1854
01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:04.933
<v Speaker 4>increase its own abilities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because that's one of the things that </v>

1855
01:26:06.981 --> 01:26:07.814
<v Speaker 4>all of these people sort of agree with </v>
<v Speaker 4>is that the launch of artificial </v>

1856
01:26:11.241 --> 01:26:14.060
<v Speaker 4>intelligence is not simply going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>

1857
01:26:14.061 --> 01:26:16.520
<v Speaker 4>we have an artificial intelligent thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>here now,</v>

1858
01:26:16.670 --> 01:26:17.503
<v Speaker 4>but it's going to be that this </v>
<v Speaker 4>artificial intelligence is going to be </v>

1859
01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:20.833
<v Speaker 4>infinitely smarter than us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>almost instantaneously because it's </v>

1860
01:26:22.911 --> 01:26:24.440
<v Speaker 4>going to innovate on itself.</v>

1861
01:26:24.550 --> 01:26:25.240
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1862
01:26:25.240 --> 01:26:26.170
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1863
01:26:26.171 --> 01:26:29.320
<v Speaker 3>I've heard Sam talk about this as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean 10,000,</v>

1864
01:26:29.980 --> 01:26:30.813
<v Speaker 3>10,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years precisely in a minute or </v>

1865
01:26:32.861 --> 01:26:33.580
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1866
01:26:33.580 --> 01:26:35.530
<v Speaker 3>so it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>

1867
01:26:35.560 --> 01:26:38.110
<v Speaker 3>So when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you say something to me,</v>

1868
01:26:38.350 --> 01:26:39.183
<v Speaker 3>my brain is operating at presumably </v>
<v Speaker 3>roughly the same speed that your brain </v>

1869
01:26:42.011 --> 01:26:42.844
<v Speaker 3>is operating and neither of us were </v>
<v Speaker 3>inebriated and other of us are </v>

1870
01:26:44.301 --> 01:26:45.134
<v Speaker 3>incredibly tired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So presumably the experience of the </v>

1871
01:26:46.691 --> 01:26:50.320
<v Speaker 3>passage of time of this conversation for</v>
<v Speaker 3>us is roughly one to one.</v>

1872
01:26:50.350 --> 01:26:51.183
<v Speaker 3>Maybe slightly off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if every single thing that you </v>

1873
01:26:54.191 --> 01:26:55.024
<v Speaker 3>said I had the experience of basically </v>
<v Speaker 3>waiting for several years to figure out </v>

1874
01:27:01.241 --> 01:27:04.780
<v Speaker 3>the perfect way to answer that and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not going to answer it.</v>

1875
01:27:04.820 --> 01:27:08.710
<v Speaker 3>That the artificial intelligence is </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be so far ahead of that because</v>

1876
01:27:08.711 --> 01:27:11.060
<v Speaker 3>we're telling me I'm the official </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence right now,</v>

1877
01:27:12.190 --> 01:27:13.023
<v Speaker 3>and so I've just been sitting here </v>
<v Speaker 3>wondering what is the best possible </v>

1878
01:27:15.251 --> 01:27:15.970
<v Speaker 3>response?</v>

1879
01:27:15.970 --> 01:27:16.803
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course I'm going to end up getting </v>

1880
01:27:17.351 --> 01:27:18.184
<v Speaker 3>better responses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I find interesting is if you make </v>

1881
01:27:20.681 --> 01:27:21.514
<v Speaker 3>this x market a robot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it'll be easier to make a robot </v>

1882
01:27:25.061 --> 01:27:27.190
<v Speaker 3>that seems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that passes the turing test.</v>

1883
01:27:27.191 --> 01:27:28.024
<v Speaker 3>That seems to us to be self aware.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then it will be to know whether or not </v>

1884
01:27:32.681 --> 01:27:37.100
<v Speaker 3>it really is self aware.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

1885
01:27:37.570 --> 01:27:39.820
<v Speaker 3>and and is there a meaningful </v>
<v Speaker 3>difference?</v>

1886
01:27:39.821 --> 01:27:41.290
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is what's interesting to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there,</v>

1887
01:27:41.291 --> 01:27:42.124
<v Speaker 3>is there a meaningful difference between</v>
<v Speaker 3>a computer that can completely </v>

1888
01:27:45.911 --> 01:27:50.710
<v Speaker 3>convincingly reassure you that it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it has feelings and a computer that</v>

1889
01:27:50.770 --> 01:27:54.420
<v Speaker 3>actually fails or what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there is a ceiling.</v>

1890
01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:55.040
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

1891
01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:56.480
<v Speaker 4>what difference does it make it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's,</v>

1892
01:27:56.510 --> 01:27:57.343
<v Speaker 4>here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like we were so connected to this idea </v>

1893
01:27:59.181 --> 01:28:00.014
<v Speaker 4>that the only life that's real is carbon</v>
<v Speaker 4>based life of biological intelligence </v>

1894
01:28:04.101 --> 01:28:05.090
<v Speaker 4>cells,</v>
<v Speaker 4>life,</v>

1895
01:28:05.091 --> 01:28:06.650
<v Speaker 4>death,</v>
<v Speaker 4>life span.</v>

1896
01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:11.270
<v Speaker 4>It has a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's got a finite reality.</v>

1897
01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:12.393
<v Speaker 4>It's eventually gonna rot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's what we think of life is </v>

1898
01:28:14.301 --> 01:28:17.730
<v Speaker 4>and that's the only thing that's worth </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything to us because we're so we're,</v>

1899
01:28:17.740 --> 01:28:18.573
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're just so inexorably connected to </v>

1900
01:28:20.751 --> 01:28:21.584
<v Speaker 4>what we are and that we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We only think that's the only kind of </v>

1901
01:28:23.601 --> 01:28:24.434
<v Speaker 4>life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there could easily be in life form </v>

1902
01:28:26.331 --> 01:28:28.350
<v Speaker 4>that exists in the form of ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1903
01:28:28.360 --> 01:28:29.193
<v Speaker 4>and I've often thought about this in </v>
<v Speaker 4>terms of like the word of the word </v>

1904
01:28:33.171 --> 01:28:35.510
<v Speaker 4>alien,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like people always love that expression,</v>

1905
01:28:35.511 --> 01:28:40.190
<v Speaker 4>alien intelligence and has,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have we ever been visited by aliens.</v>

1906
01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:41.353
<v Speaker 4>I often think that if intelligence keeps</v>
<v Speaker 4>expanding and keeps growing at the rate </v>

1907
01:28:47.751 --> 01:28:48.584
<v Speaker 4>that it has with human beings and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>compare us to people that lived a few </v>

1908
01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:52.393
<v Speaker 4>thousand years ago versus today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's impossible not to conclude that </v>

1909
01:28:56.391 --> 01:28:57.224
<v Speaker 4>people have gotten far more intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>far more capable and have far more </v>

1910
01:29:00.591 --> 01:29:01.920
<v Speaker 4>abilities than we did.</v>

1911
01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:03.490
<v Speaker 4>Whether it's technologically or you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

1912
01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:07.050
<v Speaker 4>through what the way we can manipulate </v>
<v Speaker 4>matter in our environment.</v>

1913
01:29:07.051 --> 01:29:08.760
<v Speaker 4>It's fought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>were far more capable now.</v>

1914
01:29:08.761 --> 01:29:09.594
<v Speaker 4>Right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we can continue to go from here till </v>

1915
01:29:13.350 --> 01:29:14.183
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thousands and thousands of years from </v>

1916
01:29:15.421 --> 01:29:16.254
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we could get to the point where we can </v>

1917
01:29:18.481 --> 01:29:23.481
<v Speaker 4>inject ideas and send ideas to each </v>
<v Speaker 4>other in the form of like thoughts.</v>

1918
01:29:25.350 --> 01:29:26.183
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now how do we not know that imagination </v>

1919
01:29:28.171 --> 01:29:29.004
<v Speaker 4>itself is not a life form that wants us </v>
<v Speaker 4>to continue to innovate and create and </v>

1920
01:29:34.470 --> 01:29:35.303
<v Speaker 4>build something different,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's not just a function of the </v>

1921
01:29:37.651 --> 01:29:39.520
<v Speaker 4>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not just a function of the the,</v>

1922
01:29:39.530 --> 01:29:40.363
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the conscious mind to be curious and a </v>

1923
01:29:43.891 --> 01:29:48.500
<v Speaker 4>byproduct of our time as hunter </v>
<v Speaker 4>gatherers and this constant seeking of,</v>

1924
01:29:48.501 --> 01:29:53.501
<v Speaker 4>of food and shelter and safety that is </v>
<v Speaker 4>causing us to innovate,</v>

1925
01:29:53.941 --> 01:29:58.170
<v Speaker 4>but instead these ideas are almost like </v>
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

1926
01:29:58.200 --> 01:30:03.200
<v Speaker 4>like a signal that's in the midst and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that imagination itself,</v>

1927
01:30:04.170 --> 01:30:05.003
<v Speaker 4>which is responsible for every single </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing you see in this room and in this </v>

1928
01:30:08.190 --> 01:30:10.980
<v Speaker 4>city and on this planet that human </v>
<v Speaker 4>beings have created.</v>

1929
01:30:10.981 --> 01:30:14.070
<v Speaker 4>All of it came out of the imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of it.</v>

1930
01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:17.820
<v Speaker 4>And why is this imagination so fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>hungry for innovation?</v>

1931
01:30:17.821 --> 01:30:21.750
<v Speaker 4>Why don't we have the capacity to </v>
<v Speaker 4>recognize that phones are small enough,</v>

1932
01:30:21.960 --> 01:30:24.630
<v Speaker 4>computers are fast enough is a big </v>
<v Speaker 4>enough.</v>

1933
01:30:24.810 --> 01:30:27.060
<v Speaker 4>Cars are quick enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's stop right here.</v>

1934
01:30:27.090 --> 01:30:30.030
<v Speaker 4>Let's stop right here and work for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>better good of humanity.</v>

1935
01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:31.860
<v Speaker 3>Every era.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could have said that Joe,</v>

1936
01:30:32.190 --> 01:30:33.023
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's why fuck the sixties and Shitbag </v>

1937
01:30:35.330 --> 01:30:36.163
<v Speaker 4>cars and they're fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what people will say in a half </v>

1938
01:30:39.080 --> 01:30:39.913
<v Speaker 4>century ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want to drive all those old shitty </v>

1939
01:30:40.671 --> 01:30:42.800
<v Speaker 4>jaguars and catches on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1940
01:30:43.250 --> 01:30:44.450
<v Speaker 4>but you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do.</v>

1941
01:30:44.451 --> 01:30:45.260
<v Speaker 4>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1942
01:30:45.260 --> 01:30:46.100
<v Speaker 4>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1943
01:30:46.101 --> 01:30:48.410
<v Speaker 4>you could have said that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what is it?</v>

1944
01:30:48.740 --> 01:30:50.960
<v Speaker 4>What is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what is imagination?</v>

1945
01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:51.833
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think anyone who works in a creative </v>

1946
01:30:52.921 --> 01:30:53.754
<v Speaker 3>field or maybe anyone who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even those who don't will agree that </v>

1947
01:30:57.151 --> 01:31:01.410
<v Speaker 3>there is something mysterious about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Muse for want of a better word.</v>

1948
01:31:01.411 --> 01:31:02.244
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there are moments when I'm </v>

1949
01:31:03.031 --> 01:31:03.864
<v Speaker 3>writing where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where something just dropped into my </v>

1950
01:31:04.831 --> 01:31:07.170
<v Speaker 3>head and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's great.</v>

1951
01:31:07.171 --> 01:31:09.730
<v Speaker 3>And certainly people who write music or </v>
<v Speaker 3>who painted,</v>

1952
01:31:09.760 --> 01:31:10.593
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they will get in that zone and you find </v>

1953
01:31:12.811 --> 01:31:15.240
<v Speaker 3>that flow and it is like you're writing </v>
<v Speaker 3>something else.</v>

1954
01:31:15.241 --> 01:31:17.970
<v Speaker 3>It's not like you're the author of it </v>
<v Speaker 3>entirely.</v>

1955
01:31:18.370 --> 01:31:19.203
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so on the question of whether or not </v>

1956
01:31:22.470 --> 01:31:26.580
<v Speaker 3>computers would fit in what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you say like,</v>

1957
01:31:26.581 --> 01:31:30.030
<v Speaker 3>what would it mean to say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does a computer actually feel?</v>

1958
01:31:30.450 --> 01:31:31.710
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you know the.</v>

1959
01:31:31.740 --> 01:31:34.170
<v Speaker 3>Have you heard of the essay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it like to be a bat?</v>

1960
01:31:34.200 --> 01:31:35.033
<v Speaker 3>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's called Thomas Nagel was a </v>

1961
01:31:37.261 --> 01:31:38.094
<v Speaker 3>20th century philosopher and this was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>foundational sort of philosophical </v>

1962
01:31:41.701 --> 01:31:41.910
<v Speaker 3>essay.</v>

1963
01:31:41.910 --> 01:31:42.743
<v Speaker 3>It's only about 10 pages long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm really kind of trying to nail down </v>

1964
01:31:47.550 --> 01:31:51.180
<v Speaker 3>the fundamentals of um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember the field of,</v>

1965
01:31:51.200 --> 01:31:51.750
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

1966
01:31:51.750 --> 01:31:52.583
<v Speaker 3>of philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it basically a philosophy of mind </v>

1967
01:31:54.630 --> 01:31:58.950
<v Speaker 3>where his point is it's only meaningful </v>
<v Speaker 3>to talk about things,</v>

1968
01:31:59.170 --> 01:32:01.360
<v Speaker 3>feelings if you can say like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is it,</v>

1969
01:32:01.390 --> 01:32:03.880
<v Speaker 3>what is it like to be a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an x?</v>

1970
01:32:03.910 --> 01:32:05.710
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so what is it like to be a bat?</v>

1971
01:32:05.740 --> 01:32:07.150
<v Speaker 3>That's a meaningful question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you can,</v>

1972
01:32:07.330 --> 01:32:08.163
<v Speaker 3>you can sort of look at the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can try to figure out how it </v>

1973
01:32:10.661 --> 01:32:13.690
<v Speaker 3>responds to its sonar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what that might feel like.</v>

1974
01:32:13.691 --> 01:32:15.640
<v Speaker 3>Is that a kind of a vision as a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>a sound?</v>

1975
01:32:15.970 --> 01:32:18.970
<v Speaker 3>If I pick up this cop and I say what is </v>
<v Speaker 3>it like to be this cop?</v>

1976
01:32:19.810 --> 01:32:21.850
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's essentially meaningless.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean?</v>

1977
01:32:21.851 --> 01:32:23.170
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is it like to be a cop?</v>

1978
01:32:23.170 --> 01:32:24.610
<v Speaker 3>The cop is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is nonsense.</v>

1979
01:32:24.850 --> 01:32:27.130
<v Speaker 3>It has no input.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has no experience of,</v>

1980
01:32:27.430 --> 01:32:28.263
<v Speaker 3>of life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So my question about artificial </v>

1981
01:32:31.121 --> 01:32:31.954
<v Speaker 3>intelligence is what would have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen for it to be meaningful to say </v>

1982
01:32:36.011 --> 01:32:39.340
<v Speaker 3>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it like to be that computer?</v>

1983
01:32:40.200 --> 01:32:41.033
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's more than just a </v>
<v Speaker 3>computer that can be creative or a </v>

1984
01:32:43.811 --> 01:32:44.644
<v Speaker 3>computer that can have imagination or a </v>
<v Speaker 3>computer that can spew out something </v>

1985
01:32:47.711 --> 01:32:48.544
<v Speaker 3>that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we already have computers that </v>

1986
01:32:49.811 --> 01:32:50.650
<v Speaker 3>can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

1987
01:32:50.830 --> 01:32:52.870
<v Speaker 3>write operas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bad operas,</v>

1988
01:32:52.990 --> 01:32:53.823
<v Speaker 3>but operas that conform to operas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we're not far away from having </v>

1989
01:32:57.251 --> 01:32:58.084
<v Speaker 3>computers that can write books that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>at least as good as the average book </v>

1990
01:33:01.781 --> 01:33:03.910
<v Speaker 3>that you get an airport bookstore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1991
01:33:03.940 --> 01:33:07.840
<v Speaker 3>Just a general book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for a computer to write,</v>

1992
01:33:08.650 --> 01:33:09.483
<v Speaker 3>proust is going to be difficult for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>computer to Beethoven is going to be </v>

1993
01:33:14.531 --> 01:33:17.230
<v Speaker 3>difficult and when it does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying it won't happen.</v>

1994
01:33:17.230 --> 01:33:22.230
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying this nation in human,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in humans,</v>

1995
01:33:23.111 --> 01:33:23.944
<v Speaker 3>there's some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's something about biological </v>

1996
01:33:25.271 --> 01:33:27.850
<v Speaker 3>intelligence so far,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is you,</v>

1997
01:33:27.910 --> 01:33:31.870
<v Speaker 3>which is uniquely creative and </v>
<v Speaker 3>imaginative and what the fuck is it?</v>

1998
01:33:31.871 --> 01:33:34.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Without the imagination.</v>

1999
01:33:34.091 --> 01:33:37.160
<v Speaker 3>We're just an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The are not very imaginative.</v>

2000
01:33:37.750 --> 01:33:38.583
<v Speaker 3>You know they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they still have an experience of </v>

2001
01:33:40.751 --> 01:33:43.900
<v Speaker 3>life in a way that my computer and phone</v>
<v Speaker 3>dunt for now,</v>

2002
01:33:43.930 --> 01:33:45.820
<v Speaker 3>for now and so something's going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>

2003
01:33:45.850 --> 01:33:49.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean at some point they will be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2004
01:33:49.031 --> 01:33:49.864
<v Speaker 3>I sort of agree with the materialist on </v>
<v Speaker 3>this because I'm not a religious person </v>

2005
01:33:53.170 --> 01:33:57.560
<v Speaker 3>that our brains are surely all of all of</v>
<v Speaker 3>this experience of being made for,</v>

2006
01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:00.330
<v Speaker 3>for most of us have this word </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible],</v>

2007
01:34:01.150 --> 01:34:06.150
<v Speaker 3>which means the actual experience of </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiencing knowledge and data.</v>

2008
01:34:07.601 --> 01:34:10.180
<v Speaker 3>So there's this thought experiment that </v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember from,</v>

2009
01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:14.620
<v Speaker 3>from university where imagine a child is</v>
<v Speaker 3>born in a black and white room.</v>

2010
01:34:15.010 --> 01:34:16.720
<v Speaker 3>They can't see themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just strapped down.</v>

2011
01:34:16.721 --> 01:34:18.070
<v Speaker 3>So they kinda see any color,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2012
01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:21.220
<v Speaker 3>But they learn everything there is to </v>
<v Speaker 3>know about color,</v>

2013
01:34:22.060 --> 01:34:25.600
<v Speaker 3>but scientifically school in the nature </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the light spectrum,</v>

2014
01:34:25.601 --> 01:34:27.820
<v Speaker 3>and I understand that old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that the sky is blue.</v>

2015
01:34:27.821 --> 01:34:29.440
<v Speaker 3>They know that they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've never seen this guy,</v>

2016
01:34:29.500 --> 01:34:31.870
<v Speaker 3>but they know everything there is to </v>
<v Speaker 3>know about the science of color.</v>

2017
01:34:33.520 --> 01:34:37.300
<v Speaker 3>Then one day after they've only ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>seen black and white,</v>

2018
01:34:37.780 --> 01:34:42.700
<v Speaker 3>you release them into the world and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>look around at trees and birds and skies</v>

2019
01:34:42.701 --> 01:34:46.210
<v Speaker 3>and the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What would their response be?</v>

2020
01:34:46.211 --> 01:34:47.860
<v Speaker 3>Would they respond to simply be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2021
01:34:47.861 --> 01:34:49.160
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I already know everything about cholera.</v>

2022
01:34:49.161 --> 01:34:49.520
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2023
01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:50.353
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I perceived the world previously as a </v>

2024
01:34:51.701 --> 01:34:53.680
<v Speaker 3>kind of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a paint by numbers picture,</v>

2025
01:34:53.681 --> 01:34:54.514
<v Speaker 3>so I already know that the sky was blue </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I know what the wavelength of light </v>

2026
01:34:56.591 --> 01:34:57.530
<v Speaker 3>is that makes blue</v>

2027
01:34:57.980 --> 01:35:02.980
<v Speaker 1>or would they be overwhelmed by how </v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful and amazing the world looks.</v>

2028
01:35:03.980 --> 01:35:05.360
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd be overwhelmed by how,</v>

2029
01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:06.433
<v Speaker 1>how much richer the experience of </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiencing color is than merely </v>

2030
01:35:09.171 --> 01:35:12.890
<v Speaker 1>knowing and understanding about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>spectrum of light and that difference is</v>

2031
01:35:12.891 --> 01:35:13.724
<v Speaker 1>what philosophers call the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the experience of having an experience </v>

2032
01:35:17.300 --> 01:35:20.480
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is very hard to like.</v>

2033
01:35:20.481 --> 01:35:22.250
<v Speaker 1>What is that difference?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They already had.</v>

2034
01:35:22.251 --> 01:35:25.100
<v Speaker 1>This person already had everything you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could possibly know about color,</v>

2035
01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:29.150
<v Speaker 1>what was added,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was added to the mix here that made</v>

2036
01:35:29.151 --> 01:35:31.490
<v Speaker 1>them impressed colors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A purely visual thing.</v>

2037
01:35:31.491 --> 01:35:33.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's the best example </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you're.</v>

2038
01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:34.433
<v Speaker 1>You don't feel color,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you cannot see color and then you </v>

2039
01:35:37.941 --> 01:35:38.774
<v Speaker 1>can see color.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no way you could've known </v>

2040
01:35:40.371 --> 01:35:42.230
<v Speaker 1>everything about color without seeing </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2041
01:35:42.231 --> 01:35:43.064
<v Speaker 1>but what is it that you didn't know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I didn't know what the visual </v>

2042
01:35:45.531 --> 01:35:47.420
<v Speaker 1>aspects of different hues are.</v>

2043
01:35:48.530 --> 01:35:51.080
<v Speaker 1>You hadn't experienced them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you would have been able to answer a</v>

2044
01:35:51.081 --> 01:35:53.360
<v Speaker 1>question yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Assigned.</v>

2045
01:35:53.361 --> 01:35:55.040
<v Speaker 1>Just kind of answered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2046
01:35:55.340 --> 01:35:57.620
<v Speaker 1>what question would you not have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to answer?</v>

2047
01:35:57.720 --> 01:35:59.660
<v Speaker 1>What are you don't know what it looks </v>
<v Speaker 1>like to see red,</v>

2048
01:36:00.140 --> 01:36:00.973
<v Speaker 1>but how.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you would have been able to answer </v>

2049
01:36:01.851 --> 01:36:05.090
<v Speaker 1>exactly what red means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No conversation.</v>

2050
01:36:05.091 --> 01:36:05.924
<v Speaker 1>You would have no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not without seeing no understanding of </v>

2051
01:36:10.540 --> 01:36:14.600
<v Speaker 1>quality or analogy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm absolutely nonsense argument.</v>

2052
01:36:14.601 --> 01:36:16.220
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A scientist would have been able to have</v>

2053
01:36:16.221 --> 01:36:17.054
<v Speaker 1>the person who's never seen color and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>person who has seen color and there's </v>

2054
01:36:19.281 --> 01:36:21.350
<v Speaker 1>nothing they could ask either of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would,</v>

2055
01:36:21.530 --> 01:36:22.970
<v Speaker 1>that would make a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't matter.</v>

2056
01:36:22.971 --> 01:36:26.060
<v Speaker 1>Let them that haven't experienced that </v>
<v Speaker 1>visual aspect of precisely.</v>

2057
01:36:26.061 --> 01:36:27.800
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I'm telling you it in.</v>

2058
01:36:27.801 --> 01:36:29.420
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I told you about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just the signal,</v>

2059
01:36:29.720 --> 01:36:30.553
<v Speaker 1>but it's a signal that the person who is</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing in black and white does not </v>

2060
01:36:34.461 --> 01:36:35.060
<v Speaker 1>receive.</v>

2061
01:36:35.060 --> 01:36:35.893
<v Speaker 1>Once they receive that signal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd simply becomes more data and then </v>

2062
01:36:38.391 --> 01:36:39.890
<v Speaker 1>there's no more data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>

2063
01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:43.040
<v Speaker 1>It's not more data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a visual experience of data.</v>

2064
01:36:43.790 --> 01:36:44.623
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Data know this is we're splitting hairs </v>

2065
01:36:46.401 --> 01:36:47.234
<v Speaker 1>here because if you're looking at red,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you're looking at something and </v>

2066
01:36:49.281 --> 01:36:51.200
<v Speaker 1>you just see a black and white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2067
01:36:51.260 --> 01:36:52.093
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then all of a sudden someone adds </v>

2068
01:36:52.731 --> 01:36:54.800
<v Speaker 1>something and you see color,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2069
01:36:54.801 --> 01:36:56.660
<v Speaker 1>They turn on the switch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's data.</v>

2070
01:36:56.810 --> 01:37:00.080
<v Speaker 1>So suppose that the black and white </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that in your world,</v>

2071
01:37:00.081 --> 01:37:00.914
<v Speaker 1>in your paint by numbers world red is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the number 19 and that object had a 19 </v>

2072
01:37:04.790 --> 01:37:07.460
<v Speaker 1>written on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you knew that it was red.</v>

2073
01:37:08.120 --> 01:37:08.953
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what red is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Try Try saying what the color blue is </v>

2074
01:37:11.240 --> 01:37:13.850
<v Speaker 1>timeline man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think the point,</v>

2075
01:37:13.851 --> 01:37:14.684
<v Speaker 1>the point that you're arguing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>precisely the point that philosophers </v>

2076
01:37:16.461 --> 01:37:19.070
<v Speaker 1>wrestle with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is if,</v>

2077
01:37:19.130 --> 01:37:19.460
<v Speaker 1>if the.</v>

2078
01:37:19.460 --> 01:37:20.293
<v Speaker 1>If the question we're asking is what </v>
<v Speaker 1>does it mean to actually feel and be </v>

2079
01:37:24.351 --> 01:37:25.184
<v Speaker 1>self aware and be conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would it mean for an artificial </v>

2080
01:37:27.051 --> 01:37:27.884
<v Speaker 1>system to feel the way that we do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would it mean for artificial </v>

2081
01:37:30.081 --> 01:37:33.140
<v Speaker 1>intelligence to actually have interests </v>
<v Speaker 1>for it?</v>

2082
01:37:33.141 --> 01:37:33.974
<v Speaker 1>To be meaningful for us to say what's it</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to be this computer in a way that </v>

2083
01:37:37.221 --> 01:37:39.440
<v Speaker 1>it's not meaningful to say what's it </v>
<v Speaker 1>like to be this cup?</v>

2084
01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:42.800
<v Speaker 1>Then quality was one of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting things that's sort of.</v>

2085
01:37:43.300 --> 01:37:46.640
<v Speaker 1>That's intrinsic to the experience of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being human and you're totally right.</v>

2086
01:37:46.670 --> 01:37:47.503
<v Speaker 1>It is part of our foundational knowledge</v>
<v Speaker 1>because living without it would be sort </v>

2087
01:37:52.431 --> 01:37:54.680
<v Speaker 1>of meaningless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's very,</v>

2088
01:37:54.681 --> 01:37:56.580
<v Speaker 1>very tricky to understand exactly</v>

2089
01:37:56.580 --> 01:37:59.580
<v Speaker 3>what the difference between that and </v>
<v Speaker 3>pure data is.</v>

2090
01:37:59.610 --> 01:38:01.030
<v Speaker 3>There clearly is a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it.</v>

2091
01:38:01.031 --> 01:38:03.270
<v Speaker 3>It's clearly different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a difference now.</v>

2092
01:38:03.480 --> 01:38:04.313
<v Speaker 3>It was clearly different for me to be me</v>
<v Speaker 3>alive and experiencing things then </v>

2093
01:38:08.530 --> 01:38:11.070
<v Speaker 3>merely than merely for me to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

2094
01:38:11.370 --> 01:38:13.350
<v Speaker 3>an intelligence that is just behaving </v>
<v Speaker 3>like me,</v>

2095
01:38:13.351 --> 01:38:15.080
<v Speaker 3>but actually the lights are off inside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2096
01:38:15.320 --> 01:38:17.060
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But why do you assume the lights are off</v>

2097
01:38:17.061 --> 01:38:21.380
<v Speaker 4>once the connections are being made?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you not know that artificial life</v>

2098
01:38:21.381 --> 01:38:22.214
<v Speaker 4>won't be a life?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why I think it will be at some </v>

2099
01:38:24.051 --> 01:38:27.440
<v Speaker 4>stage and it certainly can be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's we already know what I'm saying.</v>

2100
01:38:27.441 --> 01:38:28.630
<v Speaker 4>It right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That that,</v>

2101
01:38:28.940 --> 01:38:30.770
<v Speaker 3>that difference is the difference at </v>
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>

2102
01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:32.630
<v Speaker 3>how are we going to know where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

2103
01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:35.030
<v Speaker 3>once that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where that boundary is</v>

2104
01:38:35.050 --> 01:38:37.480
<v Speaker 4>being breached,</v>
<v Speaker 4>draft and know this is what I think,</v>

2105
01:38:37.481 --> 01:38:38.314
<v Speaker 4>I think what we're trying to define it </v>
<v Speaker 4>in some way where this is real life and </v>

2106
01:38:41.801 --> 01:38:42.634
<v Speaker 4>that won't be real life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The same thing as we're talking about </v>

2107
01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:45.593
<v Speaker 4>virtual reality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like this is reality and that will be a </v>

2108
01:38:48.251 --> 01:38:49.084
<v Speaker 4>fake virtual reality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't necessarily know that I'm not </v>

2109
01:38:52.241 --> 01:38:53.074
<v Speaker 4>necessarily convinced that this reality </v>
<v Speaker 4>that we experienced because we have </v>

2110
01:38:56.051 --> 01:38:56.884
<v Speaker 4>gravity because we have cells because we</v>
<v Speaker 4>feel the weight of our feet on the </v>

2111
01:39:00.161 --> 01:39:04.120
<v Speaker 4>ground as we walk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Once that is replicable,</v>

2112
01:39:04.330 --> 01:39:05.163
<v Speaker 4>once there's something that you can plug</v>
<v Speaker 4>into that gives you all have that exact </v>

2113
01:39:07.991 --> 01:39:08.824
<v Speaker 4>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not happening in the physical </v>

2114
01:39:11.021 --> 01:39:14.830
<v Speaker 4>sense and it's indiscernible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is it still happening?</v>

2115
01:39:14.860 --> 01:39:17.500
<v Speaker 4>It's absolutely still happening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The experience is still the same.</v>

2116
01:39:17.710 --> 01:39:20.260
<v Speaker 4>So is your consciousness what guides </v>
<v Speaker 4>you?</v>

2117
01:39:20.261 --> 01:39:21.094
<v Speaker 4>Is your.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is the data that hits your </v>

2118
01:39:22.931 --> 01:39:23.680
<v Speaker 4>consciousness?</v>

2119
01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:24.513
<v Speaker 4>Is that what's important or does it have</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be something that you could put on a </v>

2120
01:39:28.061 --> 01:39:32.440
<v Speaker 4>scale or measure with a ruler or or c </v>
<v Speaker 4>over a timeline?</v>

2121
01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:36.400
<v Speaker 4>What is reality is the real question </v>
<v Speaker 4>becomes,</v>

2122
01:39:36.401 --> 01:39:40.750
<v Speaker 4>and that's when people who really think </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a significant possibility,</v>

2123
01:39:40.751 --> 01:39:41.584
<v Speaker 4>there's a real physicist that we are </v>
<v Speaker 4>living in some form of a simulation </v>

2124
01:39:45.910 --> 01:39:46.743
<v Speaker 4>currently that it's one of the reasons </v>
<v Speaker 4>why reality is so preposterous is that </v>

2125
01:39:50.141 --> 01:39:55.141
<v Speaker 4>reality is a work of fiction and that if</v>
<v Speaker 4>we keep going as we are today,</v>

2126
01:39:55.600 --> 01:39:56.433
<v Speaker 4>there's gonna come a time where we are </v>
<v Speaker 4>able to create some form of virtual </v>

2127
01:40:00.191 --> 01:40:03.190
<v Speaker 4>reality that's indistinguishable from </v>
<v Speaker 4>reality.</v>

2128
01:40:03.430 --> 01:40:06.370
<v Speaker 4>So the question becomes how will we know</v>
<v Speaker 4>when we're in it?</v>

2129
01:40:06.430 --> 01:40:07.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2130
01:40:07.110 --> 01:40:08.120
<v Speaker 3>Elon Musk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2131
01:40:08.140 --> 01:40:09.960
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a big proponent of this as well.</v>

2132
01:40:09.961 --> 01:40:10.410
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

2133
01:40:10.410 --> 01:40:11.243
<v Speaker 3>he believes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he believes that it's almost certain </v>

2134
01:40:13.051 --> 01:40:15.300
<v Speaker 3>that we are in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a virtual reality right now,</v>

2135
01:40:15.330 --> 01:40:16.163
<v Speaker 3>just because the proportion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the argument goes along the </v>

2136
01:40:20.851 --> 01:40:21.684
<v Speaker 3>lines of at some point in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are going to be so many virtual </v>

2137
01:40:23.701 --> 01:40:24.534
<v Speaker 3>realities that the likelihood of us </v>
<v Speaker 3>being in one of those instead of in the </v>

2138
01:40:27.390 --> 01:40:28.530
<v Speaker 3>earthly reality that we think</v>

2139
01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:32.730
<v Speaker 4>Erin is going to be enormously more </v>
<v Speaker 4>probable.</v>

2140
01:40:32.731 --> 01:40:33.800
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can go one better.</v>

2141
01:40:33.801 --> 01:40:34.634
<v Speaker 4>That even the earthly reality is so </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking bizarre and filled with holes </v>

2142
01:40:39.530 --> 01:40:43.460
<v Speaker 4>that the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the very adams that we,</v>

2143
01:40:43.490 --> 01:40:45.550
<v Speaker 4>we have that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that exist,</v>

2144
01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:50.660
<v Speaker 4>that encompass every single aspect of </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything that we see that's physical,</v>

2145
01:40:50.810 --> 01:40:53.030
<v Speaker 4>are mostly nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then we,</v>

2146
01:40:53.200 --> 01:40:54.033
<v Speaker 4>these subatomic particles that blink in </v>
<v Speaker 4>and out of existence and they can be in </v>

2147
01:40:57.791 --> 01:41:02.350
<v Speaker 4>a super state where they're moving and </v>
<v Speaker 4>still at the same time they come and go.</v>

2148
01:41:02.351 --> 01:41:04.520
<v Speaker 4>They go somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't know where they're going</v>

2149
01:41:04.700 --> 01:41:07.590
<v Speaker 3>and forth between this dimension and </v>
<v Speaker 3>another dimension that we've done.</v>

2150
01:41:07.790 --> 01:41:10.100
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen stranger things on </v>
<v Speaker 3>Netflix?</v>

2151
01:41:11.430 --> 01:41:13.240
<v Speaker 3>The underside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which brings us to,</v>

2152
01:41:13.370 --> 01:41:17.210
<v Speaker 3>to Iosco.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2153
01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:18.513
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about a month ago I tried asked for the </v>

2154
01:41:21.831 --> 01:41:25.370
<v Speaker 3>first time and I'd want it to do it for </v>
<v Speaker 3>awhile.</v>

2155
01:41:25.430 --> 01:41:26.263
<v Speaker 3>And a friend of mine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you done with the psychedelics </v>

2156
01:41:27.741 --> 01:41:29.240
<v Speaker 3>before that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've done psychedelic.</v>

2157
01:41:29.241 --> 01:41:30.074
<v Speaker 3>I've never done DMT,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've done so I've done acid and </v>

2158
01:41:33.081 --> 01:41:37.160
<v Speaker 3>mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not for not for a few years.</v>

2159
01:41:37.880 --> 01:41:38.713
<v Speaker 3>Had some of the best experiences of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>life on acid and mean some of the most </v>

2160
01:41:41.570 --> 01:41:45.170
<v Speaker 3>eyeopening and just revelatory and </v>
<v Speaker 3>extraordinary experiences.</v>

2161
01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:46.033
<v Speaker 3>Had a bad mushroom trip and haven't </v>
<v Speaker 3>really done many psychedelics since </v>

2162
01:41:47.971 --> 01:41:49.380
<v Speaker 3>then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pad.</v>

2163
01:41:49.381 --> 01:41:50.214
<v Speaker 3>How much I was in Amsterdam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was too much for the circumstances </v>

2164
01:41:55.911 --> 01:41:57.320
<v Speaker 3>under which I was trying to hold it </v>
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>

2165
01:41:57.360 --> 01:41:59.900
<v Speaker 3>I just try to do it in public.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not supposed to do that.</v>

2166
01:41:59.930 --> 01:42:03.350
<v Speaker 3>It's going out on a trip with my brother</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Amsterdam,</v>

2167
01:42:03.351 --> 01:42:05.210
<v Speaker 3>like wandering around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like we were just.</v>

2168
01:42:05.390 --> 01:42:08.990
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was one of those moments where like,</v>

2169
01:42:08.991 --> 01:42:12.120
<v Speaker 3>you can't even remember the thought that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you had like half a second ago.</v>

2170
01:42:12.170 --> 01:42:14.810
<v Speaker 3>So your entire experience of life is </v>
<v Speaker 3>just a fractured.</v>

2171
01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:18.220
<v Speaker 5>You're</v>

2172
01:42:18.220 --> 01:42:20.460
<v Speaker 3>supposed to be quiet laying down </v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere.</v>

2173
01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:21.360
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

2174
01:42:21.420 --> 01:42:22.530
<v Speaker 3>I know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew all that,</v>

2175
01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:23.393
<v Speaker 3>but I was better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was too good for any advice that I </v>

2176
01:42:25.420 --> 01:42:26.460
<v Speaker 3>could get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Grams,</v>

2177
01:42:26.850 --> 01:42:27.683
<v Speaker 3>I don't know because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well it was mushrooms in your hand how </v>

2178
01:42:29.881 --> 01:42:31.070
<v Speaker 3>big it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a handful.</v>

2179
01:42:31.100 --> 01:42:33.580
<v Speaker 3>It was a significant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Any influence?</v>

2180
01:42:33.610 --> 01:42:34.540
<v Speaker 3>It was a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2181
01:42:35.130 --> 01:42:37.800
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we ended up like,</v>

2182
01:42:37.801 --> 01:42:40.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we tried to go into a cafe thinking that</v>

2183
01:42:40.321 --> 01:42:41.970
<v Speaker 3>that would be better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but by the time we,</v>

2184
01:42:42.110 --> 01:42:45.000
<v Speaker 3>we've made our way through the thicket </v>
<v Speaker 3>of impenetrable chairs.</v>

2185
01:42:45.001 --> 01:42:46.560
<v Speaker 3>That seems like there were too many </v>
<v Speaker 3>tables,</v>

2186
01:42:46.561 --> 01:42:47.394
<v Speaker 3>like none of it made sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know where the walls were so </v>

2187
01:42:49.161 --> 01:42:49.994
<v Speaker 3>then I'm sitting down and like I don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>know how to order tea anymore and like </v>

2188
01:42:52.861 --> 01:42:54.480
<v Speaker 3>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what people are asking for.</v>

2189
01:42:54.481 --> 01:42:56.190
<v Speaker 3>I don't know when I'm supposed to pay or</v>
<v Speaker 3>how I'm.</v>

2190
01:42:56.550 --> 01:42:58.260
<v Speaker 3>And then it just became too stressful </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>

2191
01:42:58.270 --> 01:43:00.090
<v Speaker 3>have to get out of the cafe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just all of that.</v>

2192
01:43:00.091 --> 01:43:03.070
<v Speaker 3>And then I don't even remember like how </v>
<v Speaker 3>long have you even been in the cafe at?</v>

2193
01:43:03.130 --> 01:43:05.180
<v Speaker 3>People looking at me because it was just</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of those weird,</v>

2194
01:43:05.220 --> 01:43:09.870
<v Speaker 3>like just not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean I will ask is a bit different</v>

2195
01:43:09.871 --> 01:43:13.440
<v Speaker 3>because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a shamanistic ceremony.</v>

2196
01:43:13.441 --> 01:43:16.360
<v Speaker 3>That's presided over by this Peruvian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where'd you do it?</v>

2197
01:43:16.380 --> 01:43:18.840
<v Speaker 3>Dude?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I New York in the city.</v>

2198
01:43:19.110 --> 01:43:19.441
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2199
01:43:19.441 --> 01:43:20.750
<v Speaker 3>in Brooklyn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2200
01:43:20.760 --> 01:43:24.630
<v Speaker 3>they rent out a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a dance studio or some space.</v>

2201
01:43:24.870 --> 01:43:26.190
<v Speaker 3>Did you know the other people you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing it with?</v>

2202
01:43:26.220 --> 01:43:28.830
<v Speaker 3>Only one of them was my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's done it a bunch of times.</v>

2203
01:43:28.831 --> 01:43:30.470
<v Speaker 3>He's done it a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2204
01:43:31.140 --> 01:43:34.650
<v Speaker 3>and starts about nine or 10 in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>evening.</v>

2205
01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:37.410
<v Speaker 3>Goes until about four to six in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>morning.</v>

2206
01:43:38.070 --> 01:43:41.010
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>either we're about 20 people there,</v>

2207
01:43:41.011 --> 01:43:41.844
<v Speaker 3>so it was a reasonably large group and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're all sort of lined up along the </v>

2208
01:43:45.100 --> 01:43:50.100
<v Speaker 3>walls with yoga mats and whatever else </v>
<v Speaker 3>you want a bucket to vomit into.</v>

2209
01:43:51.800 --> 01:43:53.150
<v Speaker 3>And He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2210
01:43:54.110 --> 01:43:56.240
<v Speaker 3>gives a little speech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's down in Peru a lot.</v>

2211
01:43:56.241 --> 01:43:58.010
<v Speaker 3>He's been doing this for decades.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2212
01:43:58.100 --> 01:44:00.780
<v Speaker 3>this has been going on for thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 3>years among,</v>

2213
01:44:00.870 --> 01:44:04.430
<v Speaker 3>for people who don't know what Ios is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a hallucinogen from the Amazon.</v>

2214
01:44:04.431 --> 01:44:05.264
<v Speaker 3>It's been fundamental to a lot of South </v>
<v Speaker 3>American religions for thousands of </v>

2215
01:44:08.330 --> 01:44:08.980
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

2216
01:44:08.980 --> 01:44:13.020
<v Speaker 4>Competent Tory hallucinogenic combines </v>
<v Speaker 4>the leaves of one plant,</v>

2217
01:44:13.040 --> 01:44:13.873
<v Speaker 4>the vines of another.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So one of them is dmt and the other one </v>

2218
01:44:16.661 --> 01:44:17.494
<v Speaker 4>is called an Mao inhibitor and a mano,</v>
<v Speaker 4>amy and Oxidizes Mao and your body </v>

2219
01:44:22.601 --> 01:44:23.434
<v Speaker 4>produces it and your stomach and your </v>
<v Speaker 4>gut and what it does is it keeps you </v>

2220
01:44:26.471 --> 01:44:27.304
<v Speaker 4>from getting high on Dmt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which exists in thousands of different </v>

2221
01:44:29.471 --> 01:44:30.304
<v Speaker 4>plants.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you were eating a lot of the </v>

2222
01:44:31.571 --> 01:44:32.404
<v Speaker 4>things that we eat on a regular basis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if he didn't have monoamine oxidase and </v>

2223
01:44:35.861 --> 01:44:36.694
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure it has other functions as well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it would cause you to get high on </v>

2224
01:44:40.331 --> 01:44:43.510
<v Speaker 4>certain grasses and plants and many,</v>
<v Speaker 4>many different ones.</v>

2225
01:44:43.511 --> 01:44:46.150
<v Speaker 4>So your body produces this stuff to </v>
<v Speaker 4>break that down.</v>

2226
01:44:46.390 --> 01:44:47.380
<v Speaker 4>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Glad I got you.</v>

2227
01:44:47.381 --> 01:44:50.770
<v Speaker 4>Hit Ya.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't even drink it orally.</v>

2228
01:44:50.771 --> 01:44:51.604
<v Speaker 4>Active version of DMT.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they essentially figured out a </v>

2229
01:44:56.081 --> 01:44:56.914
<v Speaker 4>solution for dealing with the motto,</v>
<v Speaker 4>aiming oxidase that your stomach </v>

2230
01:45:00.371 --> 01:45:01.204
<v Speaker 4>produces</v>

2231
01:45:01.940 --> 01:45:02.773
<v Speaker 3>long before they even knew what any of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that shit was thousands of years ago </v>

2232
01:45:05.721 --> 01:45:07.460
<v Speaker 3>when they were just screwing around in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Amazon.</v>

2233
01:45:07.570 --> 01:45:09.460
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't even know how really,</v>

2234
01:45:09.461 --> 01:45:13.330
<v Speaker 4>how old it is because they don't really </v>
<v Speaker 4>have much of a tradition.</v>

2235
01:45:14.660 --> 01:45:16.900
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they claim it's,</v>

2236
01:45:16.901 --> 01:45:18.430
<v Speaker 4>I mean they claim that it's been </v>
<v Speaker 4>fundamental,</v>

2237
01:45:18.431 --> 01:45:20.780
<v Speaker 4>but who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a verbal little notion.</v>

2238
01:45:21.010 --> 01:45:24.100
<v Speaker 4>We don't know how they figured it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't have any of those things.</v>

2239
01:45:24.260 --> 01:45:25.093
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a very interesting experience </v>

2240
01:45:28.041 --> 01:45:28.874
<v Speaker 3>because the,</v>

2241
01:45:31.330 --> 01:45:33.640
<v Speaker 3>I went into it sort of wanting what </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone,</v>

2242
01:45:33.670 --> 01:45:36.130
<v Speaker 3>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once out of a psychedelic experience,</v>

2243
01:45:36.131 --> 01:45:36.964
<v Speaker 3>which is some kind of like con opening </v>
<v Speaker 3>up of your mind and connection to the </v>

2244
01:45:40.961 --> 01:45:43.840
<v Speaker 3>cosmos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Awesome connection to your own true self</v>

2245
01:45:43.841 --> 01:45:44.674
<v Speaker 3>and your connection to life force and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the mystery of consciousness and </v>

2246
01:45:47.531 --> 01:45:49.810
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I will ask is very interesting.</v>

2247
01:45:49.930 --> 01:45:53.470
<v Speaker 3>It almost felt like it was a character </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the trip.</v>

2248
01:45:53.500 --> 01:45:58.500
<v Speaker 3>The trip was very visual and the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>portion of it was like just closed.</v>

2249
01:46:00.630 --> 01:46:04.630
<v Speaker 3>I would close my eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just an incredible expect a candy</v>

2250
01:46:04.631 --> 01:46:08.930
<v Speaker 3>collar universe of weird like Pez </v>
<v Speaker 3>dispensers,</v>

2251
01:46:08.950 --> 01:46:11.770
<v Speaker 3>dancing and all kinds of amazing visual </v>
<v Speaker 3>hallucinations.</v>

2252
01:46:12.070 --> 01:46:15.010
<v Speaker 3>I opened my eyes and the person next to </v>
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>

2253
01:46:15.011 --> 01:46:19.030
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't tell whether or not they were</v>
<v Speaker 3>there or not or whether they'd gone.</v>

2254
01:46:19.060 --> 01:46:22.600
<v Speaker 3>I think that he'd gone to the restroom </v>
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>

2255
01:46:23.090 --> 01:46:27.310
<v Speaker 3>And I could sit and it's not that dark.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't see that he was not there,</v>

2256
01:46:28.840 --> 01:46:31.210
<v Speaker 3>but I still felt like he was there and </v>
<v Speaker 3>not in like a woo.</v>

2257
01:46:31.220 --> 01:46:32.053
<v Speaker 3>All his spirit is still the airway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like I was literally not sure what </v>

2258
01:46:35.261 --> 01:46:36.094
<v Speaker 3>criteria I would need to use to </v>
<v Speaker 3>establish whether or not there was a </v>

2259
01:46:37.931 --> 01:46:41.800
<v Speaker 3>person sitting next to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the visual data was there.</v>

2260
01:46:41.860 --> 01:46:43.900
<v Speaker 3>I could see that there was just a yoga </v>
<v Speaker 3>mat,</v>

2261
01:46:44.290 --> 01:46:45.910
<v Speaker 3>but I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where'd he go?</v>

2262
01:46:46.270 --> 01:46:48.160
<v Speaker 3>Is he white?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

2263
01:46:48.760 --> 01:46:49.593
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

2264
01:46:49.770 --> 01:46:50.070
<v Speaker 3>he's</v>

2265
01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:51.690
<v Speaker 6>there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then where's his physical body?</v>

2266
01:46:51.870 --> 01:46:54.480
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you did see someone sitting next to me.</v>

2267
01:46:54.900 --> 01:46:57.600
<v Speaker 6>I think there is bang on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then where is he would like.</v>

2268
01:46:57.601 --> 01:47:01.020
<v Speaker 6>It was literally and also it was very </v>
<v Speaker 6>because some people</v>

2269
01:47:01.250 --> 01:47:02.083
<v Speaker 3>vomiting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean some people have haven't </v>

2270
01:47:02.511 --> 01:47:04.550
<v Speaker 3>experienced where they're crying and </v>
<v Speaker 3>bawling their eyes out.</v>

2271
01:47:04.590 --> 01:47:05.423
<v Speaker 3>They go to the darkest places.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was a bit nervous beforehand because </v>

2272
01:47:07.401 --> 01:47:08.234
<v Speaker 3>it shows the claim that what they claim,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the shamans claim is that it shows </v>

2273
01:47:12.111 --> 01:47:17.111
<v Speaker 3>you what you need to see about yourself </v>
<v Speaker 3>at that moment and that can be wonderful</v>

2274
01:47:17.690 --> 01:47:20.480
<v Speaker 3>or that can be negative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but whatever it is,</v>

2275
01:47:20.481 --> 01:47:23.520
<v Speaker 3>it's like Iowaska has a personality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it is Gaia.</v>

2276
01:47:23.540 --> 01:47:25.070
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is the power of laugh.</v>

2277
01:47:25.071 --> 01:47:26.230
<v Speaker 3>It's like it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2278
01:47:26.360 --> 01:47:27.193
<v Speaker 3>the Amazon itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like the lungs of the earth or </v>

2279
01:47:28.761 --> 01:47:32.270
<v Speaker 3>something and it brings you in and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>just have to roll with it because if you</v>

2280
01:47:32.271 --> 01:47:34.490
<v Speaker 3>try to fight it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it will crush you.</v>

2281
01:47:35.320 --> 01:47:37.340
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I loved,</v>

2282
01:47:37.341 --> 01:47:38.174
<v Speaker 3>what I was heartened by was the true </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of Josh steps that came out during </v>

2283
01:47:42.441 --> 01:47:45.860
<v Speaker 3>the experience was a very like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>funny,</v>

2284
01:47:47.340 --> 01:47:52.110
<v Speaker 3>not funny ha ha,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like just joyful person.</v>

2285
01:47:52.160 --> 01:47:53.100
<v Speaker 3>I could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was no,</v>

2286
01:47:53.130 --> 01:47:55.530
<v Speaker 3>there were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were moments of darkness and there</v>

2287
01:47:55.531 --> 01:47:58.320
<v Speaker 3>were moments of hallucinations were </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2288
01:47:58.321 --> 01:47:59.154
<v Speaker 3>there was the bloodied face of a woman </v>
<v Speaker 3>up in the right hand side of my </v>

2289
01:48:01.591 --> 01:48:02.424
<v Speaker 3>periphery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I started going towards it and then </v>

2290
01:48:04.261 --> 01:48:05.094
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I consciously sort of said to the Ios </v>

2291
01:48:07.911 --> 01:48:08.311
<v Speaker 3>got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2292
01:48:08.311 --> 01:48:09.460
<v Speaker 3>we can go there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want,</v>

2293
01:48:09.810 --> 01:48:12.840
<v Speaker 3>I knew that if I tried not to go there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it would get worse and worse.</v>

2294
01:48:13.110 --> 01:48:13.943
<v Speaker 3>So it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can do that and that's fine and we </v>

2295
01:48:15.511 --> 01:48:17.910
<v Speaker 3>can make this a bad trip if you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Frankly,</v>

2296
01:48:17.911 --> 01:48:18.744
<v Speaker 3>it's just more interesting over on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fun candy colored side and then it just </v>

2297
01:48:21.151 --> 01:48:23.500
<v Speaker 3>sort of faded away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think there's a,</v>

2298
01:48:23.530 --> 01:48:26.940
<v Speaker 3>there's something about relinquishing </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself to it and not trying to control</v>

2299
01:48:26.941 --> 01:48:28.320
<v Speaker 3>it and not transfer of power.</v>

2300
01:48:28.410 --> 01:48:30.800
<v Speaker 3>A lot of road trips come from is just </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to,</v>

2301
01:48:31.980 --> 01:48:34.770
<v Speaker 3>trying to control with your ego,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to control the experience.</v>

2302
01:48:35.070 --> 01:48:35.903
<v Speaker 3>So I sort of gave myself into it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>like there were moments where like the </v>

2303
01:48:38.461 --> 01:48:41.130
<v Speaker 3>funniest thing that you can ever do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you're a comic.</v>

2304
01:48:41.131 --> 01:48:42.990
<v Speaker 3>So here's a little tip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll enjoy this joe.</v>

2305
01:48:43.410 --> 01:48:46.050
<v Speaker 3>Next time you need to have the best life</v>
<v Speaker 3>of your life,</v>

2306
01:48:46.590 --> 01:48:49.230
<v Speaker 3>just pull a blanket over your head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hilarious.</v>

2307
01:48:49.560 --> 01:48:51.360
<v Speaker 3>According to Josh steps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whilst on Ios Guy,</v>

2308
01:48:51.870 --> 01:48:52.703
<v Speaker 3>funniest thing I'd ever done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like giggling madly underneath a </v>

2309
01:48:55.231 --> 01:48:58.780
<v Speaker 3>blanket with the blanket over my head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why drugs are illegal.</v>

2310
01:49:00.570 --> 01:49:02.270
<v Speaker 3>Look at them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just laughing or nothing.</v>

2311
01:49:02.300 --> 01:49:03.660
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was so funny.</v>

2312
01:49:04.140 --> 01:49:08.370
<v Speaker 3>And then so I was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So to get back to the point about what I</v>

2313
01:49:08.371 --> 01:49:09.204
<v Speaker 3>was looking for with some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>insight into the mystery of </v>

2314
01:49:10.891 --> 01:49:12.960
<v Speaker 3>consciousness and what you were just </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of talking about,</v>

2315
01:49:12.961 --> 01:49:16.440
<v Speaker 3>about like the imagination and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>self awareness.</v>

2316
01:49:18.720 --> 01:49:19.553
<v Speaker 3>I felt like about halfway through the </v>
<v Speaker 3>trip I hadn't really gotten my money's </v>

2317
01:49:21.451 --> 01:49:26.451
<v Speaker 3>worth on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a fun life goal and goal.</v>

2318
01:49:26.730 --> 01:49:27.600
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2319
01:49:27.810 --> 01:49:30.990
<v Speaker 3>I felt ripped off and the Iowaska </v>
<v Speaker 3>goddess or whatever it is,</v>

2320
01:49:30.991 --> 01:49:31.824
<v Speaker 3>like the personality of the drug was </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of visually like up here on the </v>

2321
01:49:34.471 --> 01:49:35.760
<v Speaker 3>left of my periphery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

2322
01:49:35.761 --> 01:49:36.331
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what gives?</v>

2323
01:49:36.331 --> 01:49:38.810
<v Speaker 3>Like what did it show me the show me the</v>
<v Speaker 3>majesty of,</v>

2324
01:49:39.110 --> 01:49:42.090
<v Speaker 3>of consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the drug said</v>

2325
01:49:43.700 --> 01:49:47.260
<v Speaker 3>I can't just notice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

2326
01:49:47.261 --> 01:49:47.981
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's bullshit.</v>

2327
01:49:47.981 --> 01:49:49.320
<v Speaker 3>I came here for a life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

2328
01:49:49.330 --> 01:49:50.163
<v Speaker 3>the life expand and experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted my mind to be blown and all of </v>

2329
01:49:52.541 --> 01:49:56.140
<v Speaker 3>a sudden the drug tells me that she </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't even give me an insight into the.</v>

2330
01:49:56.200 --> 01:49:59.260
<v Speaker 3>Into the nature of how incredible </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousnesses and I went off in.</v>

2331
01:49:59.261 --> 01:50:01.990
<v Speaker 3>My brain went off on different tangents </v>
<v Speaker 3>than about 10 or 15 minutes later.</v>

2332
01:50:01.991 --> 01:50:02.824
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure how long it was because you</v>
<v Speaker 3>had your sense of time is completely </v>

2333
01:50:05.290 --> 01:50:06.123
<v Speaker 3>screwed around with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was struck by how incredibly profound </v>

2334
01:50:12.190 --> 01:50:13.030
<v Speaker 3>it was.</v>

2335
01:50:14.920 --> 01:50:15.753
<v Speaker 3>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't need the drug to be aware of </v>

2336
01:50:18.041 --> 01:50:21.100
<v Speaker 3>how incredible consciousness is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just notice.</v>

2337
01:50:22.030 --> 01:50:23.830
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>

2338
01:50:23.860 --> 01:50:24.693
<v Speaker 3>And I kind of was struck by the fact </v>
<v Speaker 3>that at any point in time on drugs or </v>

2339
01:50:29.201 --> 01:50:32.260
<v Speaker 3>not day or night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wherever we are,</v>

2340
01:50:33.220 --> 01:50:38.220
<v Speaker 3>if you just remind yourself that we are </v>
<v Speaker 3>atoms that were produced inside of stars</v>

2341
01:50:40.720 --> 01:50:41.553
<v Speaker 3>that have been spewed out of exploding </v>
<v Speaker 3>stars and have accreted on this little </v>

2342
01:50:44.711 --> 01:50:48.490
<v Speaker 3>rock that is spinning around another </v>
<v Speaker 3>star.</v>

2343
01:50:49.360 --> 01:50:50.193
<v Speaker 3>And we have evolved over hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 3>millions of years from amphibians </v>

2344
01:50:53.350 --> 01:50:54.183
<v Speaker 3>through to mammals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we are self aware and web blots of </v>

2345
01:50:59.620 --> 01:51:03.370
<v Speaker 3>substance cleaning into the side of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>speck of dust in the middle of a massive</v>

2346
01:51:03.371 --> 01:51:04.204
<v Speaker 3>cosmos and we self aware and we are </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscious and we're looking at the </v>

2347
01:51:07.871 --> 01:51:10.540
<v Speaker 3>universe that created us and now having </v>
<v Speaker 3>a conversation about it.</v>

2348
01:51:11.440 --> 01:51:16.440
<v Speaker 3>That in itself is weird and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>staggering and impressive.</v>

2349
01:51:18.750 --> 01:51:19.583
<v Speaker 4>And we're a couple of decades away from </v>
<v Speaker 4>creating an artificial version of </v>

2350
01:51:24.091 --> 01:51:29.091
<v Speaker 4>ourselves quite probably quite probably </v>
<v Speaker 4>if not decades by 100 years.</v>

2351
01:51:30.830 --> 01:51:31.950
<v Speaker 4>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>

2352
01:51:32.760 --> 01:51:35.730
<v Speaker 4>And then we're off to the races.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well then we're God,</v>

2353
01:51:37.190 --> 01:51:39.080
<v Speaker 4>or not us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it is,</v>

2354
01:51:39.110 --> 01:51:43.550
<v Speaker 4>it is God because it's going to like we </v>
<v Speaker 4>were talking about become 10,000</v>

2355
01:51:43.551 --> 01:51:44.384
<v Speaker 4>years more advanced in a matter of </v>
<v Speaker 4>moments and then in a matter of moments </v>

2356
01:51:48.651 --> 01:51:49.484
<v Speaker 4>after that 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>years more and then in a matter of </v>

2357
01:51:51.561 --> 01:51:56.561
<v Speaker 4>moments in weeks and months will pass </v>
<v Speaker 4>and we will be infinitely more separated</v>

2358
01:51:57.771 --> 01:52:01.430
<v Speaker 4>from what we are today or more evolved </v>
<v Speaker 4>or more capable.</v>

2359
01:52:03.310 --> 01:52:07.300
<v Speaker 3>There was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a moment during the trip were one of the</v>

2360
01:52:07.750 --> 01:52:11.020
<v Speaker 3>female and the Shaman is on Iowa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oscar as well.</v>

2361
01:52:11.021 --> 01:52:11.854
<v Speaker 3>And he has female assistants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's saying this incredible song about </v>

2362
01:52:16.630 --> 01:52:17.463
<v Speaker 3>like the majesty of life or something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and one of the things she was saying </v>

2363
01:52:20.771 --> 01:52:21.604
<v Speaker 3>about was like that whatever the life </v>
<v Speaker 3>force is inside you is more powerful </v>

2364
01:52:26.471 --> 01:52:28.420
<v Speaker 3>than the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>More powerful than anything.</v>

2365
01:52:28.421 --> 01:52:32.020
<v Speaker 3>And it sounds a bit corny when you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>not high listening to it,</v>

2366
01:52:32.410 --> 01:52:36.460
<v Speaker 3>but it gave me a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a profound sense that yeah,</v>

2367
01:52:36.461 --> 01:52:40.210
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this web of procreating,</v>

2368
01:52:40.360 --> 01:52:41.193
<v Speaker 3>self-developing ever improving sentiment</v>
<v Speaker 3>creatures that are life is one of the </v>

2369
01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:47.833
<v Speaker 3>oldest and most enduring things in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>universe and most impressive things in </v>

2370
01:52:52.191 --> 01:52:53.024
<v Speaker 3>the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just in terms of going all the way back </v>

2371
01:52:54.891 --> 01:52:57.620
<v Speaker 3>to the genesis of life on this planet or</v>
<v Speaker 3>elsewhere.</v>

2372
01:52:57.800 --> 01:52:58.633
<v Speaker 3>So as you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we give birth to this new artificial </v>

2373
01:53:01.341 --> 01:53:03.710
<v Speaker 3>intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we will,</v>

2374
01:53:03.711 --> 01:53:04.544
<v Speaker 3>as you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>be the the organism that sort of </v>

2375
01:53:06.800 --> 01:53:11.210
<v Speaker 3>transcends from biological life to </v>
<v Speaker 3>artificial life.</v>

2376
01:53:11.211 --> 01:53:12.044
<v Speaker 3>And just being a part of being a part of</v>
<v Speaker 3>any of that experience struck me as </v>

2377
01:53:17.121 --> 01:53:17.954
<v Speaker 3>incredibly,</v>

2378
01:53:19.580 --> 01:53:20.413
<v Speaker 3>incredibly moving and touching in a way </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I know sounds stupid to people </v>

2379
01:53:24.191 --> 01:53:25.024
<v Speaker 3>who've never done psychedelics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I know that there are friends of </v>

2380
01:53:26.831 --> 01:53:27.820
<v Speaker 3>mine who are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2381
01:53:27.821 --> 01:53:28.211
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2382
01:53:28.211 --> 01:53:30.370
<v Speaker 3>you had a hippy dippy trip,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's one of the,</v>

2383
01:53:30.371 --> 01:53:31.204
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it comes back to sort of the quality of </v>

2384
01:53:32.200 --> 01:53:33.520
<v Speaker 3>question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the experience,</v>

2385
01:53:33.540 --> 01:53:38.540
<v Speaker 3>the insight that you are able to achieve</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're using these substances,</v>

2386
01:53:38.920 --> 01:53:39.753
<v Speaker 3>or alternatively if you're a good a </v>
<v Speaker 3>great meditator or something or if </v>

2387
01:53:42.341 --> 01:53:43.174
<v Speaker 3>you're in a float tank or any other way </v>
<v Speaker 3>of getting your mind into a different </v>

2388
01:53:45.311 --> 01:53:48.910
<v Speaker 3>plane than the normal daily plane is </v>
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

2389
01:53:49.120 --> 01:53:52.480
<v Speaker 3>is not a one of data.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not one that is easily explainable.</v>

2390
01:53:52.481 --> 01:53:56.490
<v Speaker 3>It's not one of reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

2391
01:53:56.491 --> 01:53:57.900
<v Speaker 3>it's an,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an insight,</v>

2392
01:53:58.790 --> 01:53:59.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an experience.</v>

2393
01:54:03.910 --> 01:54:06.640
<v Speaker 4>It's an undeniable experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

2394
01:54:06.910 --> 01:54:11.910
<v Speaker 4>I always wonder if that state that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>achieve when you're on DMT DMT,</v>

2395
01:54:12.791 --> 01:54:17.140
<v Speaker 4>which is the active component in Iowasca</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you haven't done Iowasca.</v>

2396
01:54:17.470 --> 01:54:18.303
<v Speaker 4>I've only done the hardcore form of DMT,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but dmt takes you to these places that </v>

2397
01:54:23.831 --> 01:54:27.070
<v Speaker 4>apparently you can kind of reach an </v>
<v Speaker 4>Iowasca for brief moments.</v>

2398
01:54:27.550 --> 01:54:28.383
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people feel like Iowasca is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>more spiritual version of it because it </v>

2399
01:54:30.671 --> 01:54:31.504
<v Speaker 4>lasts longer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have more time to absorb the </v>

2400
01:54:33.161 --> 01:54:33.994
<v Speaker 4>experience and a lot of times it's more </v>
<v Speaker 4>for some people more life changing </v>

2401
01:54:37.030 --> 01:54:39.460
<v Speaker 4>because dmt is so titanic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lee Alien,</v>

2402
01:54:39.461 --> 01:54:40.870
<v Speaker 4>that one when it's done,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're just like,</v>

2403
01:54:40.871 --> 01:54:43.070
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I've.</v>

2404
01:54:43.180 --> 01:54:47.140
<v Speaker 4>I've done dmt over the course of several</v>
<v Speaker 4>hours or you keep doing it.</v>

2405
01:54:47.940 --> 01:54:49.740
<v Speaker 3>Oh right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just keep doing it because you smoke</v>

2406
01:54:49.741 --> 01:54:50.041
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

2407
01:54:50.041 --> 01:54:51.460
<v Speaker 3>and then the last 15 minutes</v>

2408
01:54:51.770 --> 01:54:52.603
<v Speaker 4>trips,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you fucking banging out one more </v>

2409
01:54:54.351 --> 01:54:55.460
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get back in there.</v>

2410
01:54:55.710 --> 01:54:57.450
<v Speaker 3>Did you have someone coaching your way </v>
<v Speaker 3>through it?</v>

2411
01:54:57.451 --> 01:54:58.284
<v Speaker 3>Because my friend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my Iowaska friend who introduced me to </v>

2412
01:55:00.001 --> 01:55:00.834
<v Speaker 3>this ceremony,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tried dmt once and read and really had </v>

2413
01:55:03.931 --> 01:55:06.150
<v Speaker 3>a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>had a freakout and wasn't crazy about it</v>

2414
01:55:06.160 --> 01:55:06.993
<v Speaker 3>and was then told you should really have</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who sort of knows what they're </v>

2415
01:55:09.151 --> 01:55:12.560
<v Speaker 3>doing with your.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't be a pussy or wouldn't be a it.</v>

2416
01:55:13.130 --> 01:55:13.340
<v Speaker 3>Let it</v>

2417
01:55:13.340 --> 01:55:15.320
<v Speaker 4>go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got to let him take you there and.</v>

2418
01:55:15.321 --> 01:55:18.680
<v Speaker 4>But your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your mind does get exposed.</v>

2419
01:55:18.681 --> 01:55:19.514
<v Speaker 4>Your thoughts do get exposed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You find out what's negative and what's </v>

2420
01:55:21.531 --> 01:55:23.030
<v Speaker 4>positive about the way you look at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>

2421
01:55:23.300 --> 01:55:24.133
<v Speaker 4>I had one of the most powerful </v>
<v Speaker 4>experiences ever and my second trip </v>

2422
01:55:28.040 --> 01:55:28.873
<v Speaker 4>where I had this visualization of </v>
<v Speaker 4>negative thinking like I had a negative </v>

2423
01:55:33.081 --> 01:55:33.914
<v Speaker 4>thought came into my head and it was </v>
<v Speaker 4>like dark and twisted and I just had </v>

2424
01:55:38.931 --> 01:55:39.764
<v Speaker 4>this negative thought and then I </v>
<v Speaker 4>realized that I was thinking in a </v>

2425
01:55:43.981 --> 01:55:47.550
<v Speaker 4>negative way and this is a physical </v>
<v Speaker 4>manifestation in front of me of negative</v>

2426
01:55:47.551 --> 01:55:52.440
<v Speaker 4>thinking and at that moment I relaxed </v>
<v Speaker 4>and thought wonderful,</v>

2427
01:55:52.441 --> 01:55:53.274
<v Speaker 4>beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>positive thoughts and it blossomed into </v>

2428
01:55:56.851 --> 01:55:57.684
<v Speaker 4>this incredible flower of geometric </v>
<v Speaker 4>patterns and continued to get more and </v>

2429
01:56:02.521 --> 01:56:04.470
<v Speaker 4>more beautiful as I relaxed more and </v>
<v Speaker 4>more.</v>

2430
01:56:04.680 --> 01:56:08.130
<v Speaker 4>It was like a physical manifestation of </v>
<v Speaker 4>looking at negative thinking.</v>

2431
01:56:08.350 --> 01:56:09.183
<v Speaker 4>It was negative.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That negative was like dark black and </v>

2432
01:56:11.131 --> 01:56:12.750
<v Speaker 4>green,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it was just like,</v>

2433
01:56:12.960 --> 01:56:15.720
<v Speaker 4>it was like a toxic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We close.</v>

2434
01:56:15.770 --> 01:56:17.340
<v Speaker 4>No totally closed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2435
01:56:17.730 --> 01:56:18.563
<v Speaker 4>but I was so fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I probably wouldn't have mattered if I </v>

2436
01:56:20.071 --> 01:56:21.930
<v Speaker 4>opened my eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would have seen the same thing.</v>

2437
01:56:21.931 --> 01:56:23.830
<v Speaker 4>I was so gone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're,</v>

2438
01:56:23.840 --> 01:56:24.680
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

2439
01:56:24.760 --> 01:56:26.400
<v Speaker 4>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you dissolve.</v>

2440
01:56:26.401 --> 01:56:29.610
<v Speaker 4>You cease to be there when you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>the DMT,</v>

2441
01:56:29.611 --> 01:56:32.900
<v Speaker 4>the most intense version of smoking it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2442
01:56:33.510 --> 01:56:34.343
<v Speaker 4>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if we will eventually be there </v>

2443
01:56:39.600 --> 01:56:40.433
<v Speaker 4>because what that feels like when you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing dmt and Mckenna's described it as </v>

2444
01:56:44.731 --> 01:56:49.731
<v Speaker 4>Terence Mckenna described it as like </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're in some sort of a well of souls,</v>

2445
01:56:50.010 --> 01:56:54.300
<v Speaker 4>that you transcend the physical body and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you enter into some space,</v>

2446
01:56:54.301 --> 01:56:59.301
<v Speaker 4>some well of souls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if this thing that we look at,</v>

2447
01:56:59.790 --> 01:57:03.420
<v Speaker 4>we look at reality and we look at Adams </v>
<v Speaker 4>and what we're talking about,</v>

2448
01:57:03.421 --> 01:57:04.254
<v Speaker 4>the physical space,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when Adam's are mostly nothing and then </v>

2449
01:57:06.751 --> 01:57:10.980
<v Speaker 4>these subatomic particles that blink in </v>
<v Speaker 4>and out of position.</v>

2450
01:57:11.130 --> 01:57:11.963
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if what really is going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>happen as we get more and more evolved </v>

2451
01:57:16.501 --> 01:57:19.380
<v Speaker 4>and more and more powerful with our </v>
<v Speaker 4>ability to manipulate matter,</v>

2452
01:57:19.381 --> 01:57:21.630
<v Speaker 4>is that we're going to transcend this </v>
<v Speaker 4>dimension.</v>

2453
01:57:22.200 --> 01:57:23.033
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if that place that we go to is </v>
<v Speaker 4>where our future lies and that our </v>

2454
01:57:26.671 --> 01:57:27.504
<v Speaker 4>future doesn't lie in the stars because </v>
<v Speaker 4>the stars aren't even real and that the </v>

2455
01:57:31.080 --> 01:57:33.440
<v Speaker 4>real dimension means they're real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is in.</v>

2456
01:57:33.470 --> 01:57:36.180
<v Speaker 4>You can see them and you can send things</v>
<v Speaker 4>to them and you can measure them.</v>

2457
01:57:36.510 --> 01:57:37.343
<v Speaker 4>But this is just a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>almost like a prison of a dimension and </v>

2458
01:57:40.980 --> 01:57:45.690
<v Speaker 4>this dimension can be transcended and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you can briefly view it when you do</v>

2459
01:57:45.691 --> 01:57:49.820
<v Speaker 4>dmt or when you visit the Iowasca God </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you,</v>

2460
01:57:49.880 --> 01:57:50.713
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you pass through and briefly into that </v>

2461
01:57:52.561 --> 01:57:53.394
<v Speaker 4>dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if one day that is where </v>

2462
01:57:55.350 --> 01:57:56.183
<v Speaker 4>consciousness will exist all the time </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that we are creating this </v>

2463
01:58:00.571 --> 01:58:05.190
<v Speaker 4>possibility in this door through our </v>
<v Speaker 4>thirst for innovation and knowledge and,</v>

2464
01:58:05.191 --> 01:58:06.024
<v Speaker 4>and this constant evaluation of our </v>
<v Speaker 4>current abilities and the constant </v>

2465
01:58:10.531 --> 01:58:11.364
<v Speaker 4>desire to improve upon those abilities,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that one day it'll get passed this </v>

2466
01:58:15.061 --> 01:58:15.894
<v Speaker 4>desire to have artificial intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 4>and what is this intelligence going to </v>

2467
01:58:18.901 --> 01:58:19.620
<v Speaker 4>be able to do?</v>

2468
01:58:19.620 --> 01:58:20.453
<v Speaker 4>What's it going to be able to achieve </v>
<v Speaker 4>and what's it going to be able to </v>

2469
01:58:22.411 --> 01:58:23.244
<v Speaker 4>accomplish?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we're going gonna open up other </v>

2470
01:58:25.741 --> 01:58:29.100
<v Speaker 4>dimensions as possibilities for </v>
<v Speaker 4>consciousness to exist in.</v>

2471
01:58:29.380 --> 01:58:30.700
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this sounds a lot like,</v>

2472
01:58:30.760 --> 01:58:33.880
<v Speaker 3>like pre abrahamic religion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2473
01:58:33.881 --> 01:58:38.881
<v Speaker 3>I mean this sounds a lot like religions </v>
<v Speaker 3>were experience and indigenous religions</v>

2474
01:58:39.431 --> 01:58:41.830
<v Speaker 3>where before we fucked everything with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2475
01:58:41.860 --> 01:58:44.950
<v Speaker 3>with Moses and Jesus and Mohammed.</v>

2476
01:58:45.020 --> 01:58:45.801
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you say that.</v>

2477
01:58:45.801 --> 01:58:46.634
<v Speaker 4>But do you know that most most recent </v>
<v Speaker 4>scholars in Jerusalem believed that the </v>

2478
01:58:49.971 --> 01:58:51.830
<v Speaker 4>Moses experience was about dmt?</v>

2479
01:58:52.080 --> 01:58:53.940
<v Speaker 3>The Moses experienced specifically?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh No.</v>

2480
01:58:53.941 --> 01:58:56.400
<v Speaker 3>I'm only is that that a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>early.</v>

2481
01:58:56.401 --> 01:59:00.990
<v Speaker 3>A lot of those old testament things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>writers were on psychedelic.</v>

2482
01:59:01.060 --> 01:59:01.893
<v Speaker 4>Most likely they were.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you think about the fact that </v>

2483
01:59:03.501 --> 01:59:05.720
<v Speaker 4>psychedelics has been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have been here forever,</v>

2484
01:59:05.830 --> 01:59:06.670
<v Speaker 3>so what's the Moses</v>

2485
01:59:06.900 --> 01:59:10.440
<v Speaker 4>the most experiences that Moses saw?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The burning Bush that represented God?</v>

2486
01:59:10.460 --> 01:59:10.981
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2487
01:59:10.981 --> 01:59:15.981
<v Speaker 4>one of the most dmt rich plants in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>area where Moses was the Acacia tree.</v>

2488
01:59:17.360 --> 01:59:18.193
<v Speaker 4>The acacia Bush is rich in DMT.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If that was on fire or if you figured </v>

2489
01:59:22.831 --> 01:59:23.664
<v Speaker 4>out a way to extract dmt from it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then he smoked it or you lit it on fire </v>

2490
01:59:27.211 --> 01:59:28.044
<v Speaker 4>and did some sort of a way where you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>absorbing this smoke and absorbing the </v>

2491
01:59:31.321 --> 01:59:32.154
<v Speaker 4>DMT,</v>

2492
01:59:32.280 --> 01:59:33.001
<v Speaker 3>you would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

2493
01:59:33.001 --> 01:59:34.680
<v Speaker 3>you would see God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's A.</v>

2494
01:59:34.710 --> 01:59:38.670
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of DMT.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Flora in Australia apparently,</v>

2495
01:59:38.870 --> 01:59:40.770
<v Speaker 3>and I just feel arris grass,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2496
01:59:40.880 --> 01:59:41.713
<v Speaker 3>A lot of different plants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's an Australian native called the </v>

2497
01:59:44.191 --> 01:59:47.010
<v Speaker 3>wattle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I think is the national plant.</v>

2498
01:59:47.011 --> 01:59:49.260
<v Speaker 3>I'd have to look that up or maybe it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>the state plan of my state.</v>

2499
01:59:49.660 --> 01:59:50.461
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>

2500
01:59:50.461 --> 01:59:52.890
<v Speaker 3>and Acacia isn't that they're all part </v>
<v Speaker 3>of that family.</v>

2501
01:59:52.891 --> 01:59:53.724
<v Speaker 3>And so I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was looking earlier this year that </v>

2502
01:59:55.231 --> 01:59:59.160
<v Speaker 3>there's a push in Australia to get a </v>
<v Speaker 3>Iowaska off the,</v>

2503
01:59:59.500 --> 02:00:00.211
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the register,</v>

2504
02:00:00.211 --> 02:00:02.520
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the banned substances list and permitted</v>

2505
02:00:02.521 --> 02:00:04.260
<v Speaker 3>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a religious,</v>

2506
02:00:04.261 --> 02:00:05.520
<v Speaker 3>as a madison,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a medicine.</v>

2507
02:00:05.560 --> 02:00:06.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It helps a lot of people.</v>

2508
02:00:06.911 --> 02:00:07.744
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of people that go to it </v>
<v Speaker 4>that have all sorts of addictions and </v>

2509
02:00:10.091 --> 02:00:13.030
<v Speaker 4>all sorts of real problems and it sort </v>
<v Speaker 4>of reset their brain,</v>

2510
02:00:13.410 --> 02:00:14.243
<v Speaker 4>resets their life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's one of many different psychedelics </v>

2511
02:00:16.541 --> 02:00:17.374
<v Speaker 4>that are really good at that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He Boga is incredibly good for people </v>

2512
02:00:20.741 --> 02:00:21.574
<v Speaker 4>that have addictions to opiates,</v>
<v Speaker 4>literally resets the way your brain </v>

2513
02:00:26.230 --> 02:00:29.350
<v Speaker 4>views and connects to addictive </v>
<v Speaker 4>substance.</v>

2514
02:00:29.410 --> 02:00:30.161
<v Speaker 3>So I've heard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2515
02:00:30.161 --> 02:00:30.994
<v Speaker 3>I mean one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did a story on huffpost live about </v>

2516
02:00:32.381 --> 02:00:33.214
<v Speaker 3>Iowaska before I'd ever used it and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>were saying that there's some </v>

2517
02:00:35.081 --> 02:00:39.370
<v Speaker 3>interesting research about its ability </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be a circuit breaker against,</v>

2518
02:00:39.371 --> 02:00:41.110
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>alcoholism and stuff like that,</v>

2519
02:00:41.111 --> 02:00:44.060
<v Speaker 3>that people will go into the experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alcoholics tends to come out.</v>

2520
02:00:44.140 --> 02:00:44.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2521
02:00:44.930 --> 02:00:45.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was psychedelics.</v>

2522
02:00:46.060 --> 02:00:46.893
<v Speaker 3>So I mean if it's so difficult to know </v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is going on with </v>

2523
02:00:50.051 --> 02:00:50.890
<v Speaker 3>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2524
02:00:50.891 --> 02:00:51.724
<v Speaker 3>Why is it that we are assembled in such </v>
<v Speaker 3>a way as to have these experiences and </v>

2525
02:00:56.921 --> 02:00:57.754
<v Speaker 3>to be conscious at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but why do you think that it's a </v>

2526
02:00:59.801 --> 02:01:00.634
<v Speaker 3>different dimension that we could cross </v>
<v Speaker 3>into rather than just a another </v>

2527
02:01:06.640 --> 02:01:11.640
<v Speaker 3>perspective on this world that we are </v>
<v Speaker 3>opened up to because we're ordinarily.</v>

2528
02:01:13.240 --> 02:01:14.073
<v Speaker 3>I mean my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my theory I suppose although it's </v>

2529
02:01:15.940 --> 02:01:20.150
<v Speaker 3>tentative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is we have the capacity to be tuned into</v>

2530
02:01:20.170 --> 02:01:23.830
<v Speaker 3>all kinds of amazing shit that's going </v>
<v Speaker 3>on in the universe,</v>

2531
02:01:24.360 --> 02:01:25.890
<v Speaker 3>but I really mean in terms of woo.</v>

2532
02:01:25.960 --> 02:01:27.730
<v Speaker 3>I mean in terms of spiritual ghosts or </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>

2533
02:01:27.731 --> 02:01:28.564
<v Speaker 3>I just mean there was a perspective on </v>
<v Speaker 3>life that is much bigger than the one </v>

2534
02:01:32.351 --> 02:01:36.160
<v Speaker 3>that we walk around with a on our day to</v>
<v Speaker 3>day on a day to day basis,</v>

2535
02:01:36.580 --> 02:01:37.413
<v Speaker 3>but evolution has has favored traits </v>
<v Speaker 3>that force us to focus on getting food </v>

2536
02:01:42.921 --> 02:01:45.460
<v Speaker 3>and having sex and surviving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2537
02:01:45.650 --> 02:01:46.483
<v Speaker 3>Which means that it has intentionally </v>
<v Speaker 3>closed the parameters of what our mind </v>

2538
02:01:49.461 --> 02:01:52.760
<v Speaker 3>is capable of experiencing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It goes intentionally closed or is there</v>

2539
02:01:52.761 --> 02:01:56.420
<v Speaker 3>no benefit for the biological is what I </v>
<v Speaker 3>made distracted by these.</v>

2540
02:01:56.421 --> 02:01:58.040
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Running from tigers.</v>

2541
02:01:58.041 --> 02:01:59.890
<v Speaker 3>Precisely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to cave man who's like,</v>

2542
02:01:59.891 --> 02:02:04.250
<v Speaker 3>who's like philosophizing a bit about </v>
<v Speaker 3>his place in the cosmos is eating well.</v>

2543
02:02:04.270 --> 02:02:05.690
<v Speaker 3>He gets eating wise tripping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2544
02:02:06.200 --> 02:02:07.130
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

2545
02:02:07.190 --> 02:02:09.170
<v Speaker 3>this is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's such a spiritual journey.</v>

2546
02:02:09.171 --> 02:02:13.340
<v Speaker 3>We Abbott startup gets devoured by a </v>
<v Speaker 3>woolly mammoth,</v>

2547
02:02:13.420 --> 02:02:16.670
<v Speaker 3>a little silly voice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

2548
02:02:16.710 --> 02:02:21.100
<v Speaker 3>and what drugs do is they break down the</v>
<v Speaker 3>walls of perception and you know,</v>

2549
02:02:21.140 --> 02:02:22.640
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to borrow from Huxley,</v>

2550
02:02:22.641 --> 02:02:24.620
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they shatter those,</v>

2551
02:02:24.800 --> 02:02:27.890
<v Speaker 3>those kinds of limits and constraints </v>
<v Speaker 3>that our biology,</v>

2552
02:02:27.891 --> 02:02:28.724
<v Speaker 3>that evolution has put on our mental </v>
<v Speaker 3>ability and simply let the mind wander </v>

2553
02:02:31.851 --> 02:02:33.690
<v Speaker 3>into whatever space it cares to go to.</v>

2554
02:02:33.750 --> 02:02:34.280
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2555
02:02:34.280 --> 02:02:36.210
<v Speaker 4>why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>By using the word dimension,</v>

2556
02:02:36.211 --> 02:02:37.340
<v Speaker 4>I think we've sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2557
02:02:37.740 --> 02:02:38.573
<v Speaker 4>we've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've limited the perception of what I'm </v>

2558
02:02:40.801 --> 02:02:41.634
<v Speaker 4>saying because we already have like </v>
<v Speaker 4>three dimensions that we believe in and </v>

2559
02:02:44.911 --> 02:02:47.580
<v Speaker 4>the dimensions that we understand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>four dimensions that we believe in,</v>

2560
02:02:47.600 --> 02:02:51.450
<v Speaker 4>but also the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they believe that</v>

2561
02:02:51.840 --> 02:02:54.720
<v Speaker 3>quantum physics there a nine or 1111 is </v>
<v Speaker 3>it?</v>

2562
02:02:54.721 --> 02:02:55.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2563
02:02:55.090 --> 02:02:55.923
<v Speaker 4>So we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we understand that there are other </v>

2564
02:02:57.431 --> 02:02:59.590
<v Speaker 4>dimensions that we don't totally </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand yet,</v>

2565
02:02:59.800 --> 02:03:00.633
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2566
02:03:00.730 --> 02:03:01.580
<v Speaker 4>but those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those are,</v>

2567
02:03:01.720 --> 02:03:02.740
<v Speaker 4>those are words,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2568
02:03:02.741 --> 02:03:04.270
<v Speaker 4>To mentions their words,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's time,</v>

2569
02:03:04.271 --> 02:03:05.230
<v Speaker 4>space,</v>
<v Speaker 4>distance,</v>

2570
02:03:05.231 --> 02:03:10.231
<v Speaker 4>all these different things or words and </v>
<v Speaker 4>these words sort of lock in a definition</v>

2571
02:03:10.451 --> 02:03:13.330
<v Speaker 4>in our own mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But whatever the fuck it is,</v>

2572
02:03:13.360 --> 02:03:14.193
<v Speaker 4>when you do have a dmt trip,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you go to a place and that place is not </v>

2573
02:03:18.760 --> 02:03:20.020
<v Speaker 4>right here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>

2574
02:03:20.021 --> 02:03:20.854
<v Speaker 4>you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not here when you go there and </v>

2575
02:03:22.781 --> 02:03:27.781
<v Speaker 4>it's some all encompassing infinite </v>
<v Speaker 4>geometric place called a dimension.</v>

2576
02:03:29.951 --> 02:03:32.020
<v Speaker 4>But that's just a noise that you make </v>
<v Speaker 4>with your mouth.</v>

2577
02:03:32.100 --> 02:03:36.010
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't really matter what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's something that you experienced that</v>

2578
02:03:36.011 --> 02:03:40.570
<v Speaker 4>you don't experience right here in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Calabasas or wherever the fuck we are.</v>

2579
02:03:40.870 --> 02:03:41.470
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2580
02:03:41.470 --> 02:03:43.690
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's something different about it.</v>

2581
02:03:44.170 --> 02:03:46.960
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>could it be another dimension?</v>

2582
02:03:46.961 --> 02:03:48.670
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Could it be all in your imagination?</v>

2583
02:03:49.340 --> 02:03:51.490
<v Speaker 4>Your imagination might also be another </v>
<v Speaker 4>dimension.</v>

2584
02:03:52.230 --> 02:03:53.063
<v Speaker 4>The word dimension is a weird word </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's so limiting and defining </v>

2585
02:03:56.410 --> 02:03:57.243
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we have these preconceived ideas </v>

2586
02:04:00.041 --> 02:04:00.550
<v Speaker 4>that we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2587
02:04:00.550 --> 02:04:02.320
<v Speaker 4>there's a box that we can put our head,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2588
02:04:02.321 --> 02:04:04.240
<v Speaker 4>it's a dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's the dimension,</v>

2589
02:04:04.610 --> 02:04:05.443
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever that thing is that you can </v>

2590
02:04:08.261 --> 02:04:09.094
<v Speaker 4>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If we can tap into that and other ways </v>

2591
02:04:12.220 --> 02:04:14.920
<v Speaker 4>is going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the world is going to get very strange.</v>

2592
02:04:15.090 --> 02:04:17.580
<v Speaker 3>One thing that struck me after the </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience,</v>

2593
02:04:17.610 --> 02:04:18.443
<v Speaker 3>which gives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I think it bolsters the idea that </v>

2594
02:04:21.990 --> 02:04:22.823
<v Speaker 3>there is something real about that </v>
<v Speaker 3>dimension and slash intelligence or </v>

2595
02:04:25.591 --> 02:04:27.420
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever you want to call it,</v>

2596
02:04:27.990 --> 02:04:28.823
<v Speaker 3>was the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was that I noticed that whenever people </v>

2597
02:04:30.511 --> 02:04:32.790
<v Speaker 3>have these experiences and go to these </v>
<v Speaker 3>places,</v>

2598
02:04:32.791 --> 02:04:33.624
<v Speaker 3>regardless of what mechanism they use,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they always come out with basically the </v>

2599
02:04:38.461 --> 02:04:39.294
<v Speaker 3>same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just have a conclusion and if it was </v>

2600
02:04:42.511 --> 02:04:46.450
<v Speaker 3>merely what someone like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2601
02:04:46.740 --> 02:04:48.500
<v Speaker 3>who's a tele,</v>
<v Speaker 3>penn,</v>

2602
02:04:48.520 --> 02:04:50.880
<v Speaker 3>penn and teller,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of my pendulous nine.</v>

2603
02:04:50.960 --> 02:04:53.150
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it was merely what a person like Penn</v>

2604
02:04:53.150 --> 02:04:53.983
<v Speaker 3>Jillette thinks it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is just the [inaudible] of your </v>

2605
02:04:55.861 --> 02:04:56.491
<v Speaker 3>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2606
02:04:56.491 --> 02:04:58.830
<v Speaker 3>Do you mean you take this stuff but he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>never done anything?</v>

2607
02:04:59.100 --> 02:04:59.761
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

2608
02:04:59.761 --> 02:05:00.950
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's lost.</v>

2609
02:05:01.080 --> 02:05:01.913
<v Speaker 3>So he's not just a teetotaler.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a denier of the possibility of all </v>

2610
02:05:04.891 --> 02:05:06.990
<v Speaker 3>these different experiences being </v>
<v Speaker 3>transcendent.</v>

2611
02:05:07.020 --> 02:05:08.210
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was.</v>

2612
02:05:08.580 --> 02:05:09.413
<v Speaker 3>As far as he's concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happens when you take dmt is that </v>

2613
02:05:11.551 --> 02:05:14.550
<v Speaker 3>there are neurological disturbances and </v>
<v Speaker 3>your brain goes,</v>

2614
02:05:14.610 --> 02:05:15.443
<v Speaker 3>goes in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has weird experiences because the drug </v>

2615
02:05:16.921 --> 02:05:19.350
<v Speaker 3>is just fucking with your neurology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the Daddy said to Moses,</v>

2616
02:05:19.351 --> 02:05:20.184
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

2617
02:05:20.230 --> 02:05:20.970
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why don't you,</v>

2618
02:05:20.970 --> 02:05:21.761
<v Speaker 4>why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why have you?</v>

2619
02:05:21.761 --> 02:05:22.770
<v Speaker 4>How come you have no interest?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

2620
02:05:22.780 --> 02:05:25.240
<v Speaker 4>I think everything has been learned from</v>
<v Speaker 4>those experience.</v>

2621
02:05:25.480 --> 02:05:27.070
<v Speaker 4>Everything that we've already figured it</v>
<v Speaker 4>out,</v>

2622
02:05:27.970 --> 02:05:30.390
<v Speaker 4>we've already taken what we can from </v>
<v Speaker 4>those experiences.</v>

2623
02:05:30.400 --> 02:05:32.680
<v Speaker 4>Nothing to be learned by doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Other people have already done it.</v>

2624
02:05:33.040 --> 02:05:34.420
<v Speaker 4>Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're out of your fucking mind.</v>

2625
02:05:34.720 --> 02:05:35.980
<v Speaker 4>And if that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then just do it.</v>

2626
02:05:36.260 --> 02:05:37.240
<v Speaker 4>Then there's no harm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2627
02:05:37.241 --> 02:05:42.241
<v Speaker 4>So silly to say that is so silly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love that guy.</v>

2628
02:05:43.780 --> 02:05:44.613
<v Speaker 4>He's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think he is missing out on a </v>

2629
02:05:46.551 --> 02:05:48.750
<v Speaker 4>massive blind spot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just massive blind.</v>

2630
02:05:48.751 --> 02:05:53.290
<v Speaker 4>But Dick Chunk of possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He thinks it's hallucinations.</v>

2631
02:05:53.540 --> 02:05:54.221
<v Speaker 4>He thought.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2632
02:05:54.221 --> 02:05:56.200
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He really doesn't know.</v>

2633
02:05:56.201 --> 02:05:57.070
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't understand.</v>

2634
02:05:57.320 --> 02:05:58.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of it is hallucinations,</v>

2635
02:05:58.791 --> 02:05:59.810
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So here's it.</v>

2636
02:06:00.850 --> 02:06:01.680
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure.</v>

2637
02:06:01.680 --> 02:06:04.850
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it might be what Mckenna thinks.</v>

2638
02:06:04.851 --> 02:06:06.840
<v Speaker 4>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It might be a wealth of souls.</v>

2639
02:06:07.020 --> 02:06:07.853
<v Speaker 4>It might be what life is this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This whole biological thing might </v>

2640
02:06:12.301 --> 02:06:14.440
<v Speaker 4>literally be the cocoon that we were </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about.</v>

2641
02:06:14.510 --> 02:06:15.343
<v Speaker 3>But when I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I close my eyes and I see a </v>

2642
02:06:17.870 --> 02:06:22.870
<v Speaker 3>mechanistic universe of bright pink,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yellow and purple machines cranking away</v>

2643
02:06:23.840 --> 02:06:28.840
<v Speaker 3>and exploding and little sort of Mario </v>
<v Speaker 3>style computer things bouncing around on</v>

2644
02:06:29.121 --> 02:06:29.954
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I start spinning through </v>

2645
02:06:31.761 --> 02:06:32.594
<v Speaker 3>kaleidoscopes of color.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you implying that Mckenna Mckenna </v>

2646
02:06:36.351 --> 02:06:37.184
<v Speaker 3>would say that those are actual real </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that I'm seeing in another </v>

2647
02:06:39.921 --> 02:06:41.870
<v Speaker 3>dimension?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Woody Kenna</v>

2648
02:06:41.870 --> 02:06:44.500
<v Speaker 4>believed that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What you were expecting?</v>

2649
02:06:44.510 --> 02:06:47.140
<v Speaker 4>He had some weird names for them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he called them.</v>

2650
02:06:47.160 --> 02:06:47.993
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what did you call machine elves and </v>

2651
02:06:50.481 --> 02:06:54.620
<v Speaker 4>hyperspace.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He believed that they were entities.</v>

2652
02:06:54.680 --> 02:06:58.010
<v Speaker 4>He believed that they were living </v>
<v Speaker 4>entities and that you were communicating</v>

2653
02:06:58.011 --> 02:06:59.060
<v Speaker 4>with each other.</v>

2654
02:06:59.300 --> 02:07:02.490
<v Speaker 3>No words.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could believe that.</v>

2655
02:07:02.670 --> 02:07:03.503
<v Speaker 3>I think there are clearly hallucinations</v>
<v Speaker 3>because there are just things like I </v>

2656
02:07:06.271 --> 02:07:09.300
<v Speaker 3>would open my eyes and then there was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>river in the middle of the,</v>

2657
02:07:09.360 --> 02:07:12.210
<v Speaker 3>of the room between me and the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>people sitting there.</v>

2658
02:07:12.211 --> 02:07:15.410
<v Speaker 3>Like I'd seen no reason to assume that </v>
<v Speaker 3>that actually was a river a,</v>

2659
02:07:15.450 --> 02:07:16.283
<v Speaker 3>but maybe it was anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But where it comes to like souls and </v>

2660
02:07:19.741 --> 02:07:20.574
<v Speaker 3>where it starts getting really woo woo </v>
<v Speaker 3>is when I could feel the tug of going </v>

2661
02:07:23.851 --> 02:07:28.500
<v Speaker 3>into a particular place like the woman's</v>
<v Speaker 3>head or something like I could feel.</v>

2662
02:07:28.501 --> 02:07:31.680
<v Speaker 3>There were moments where I was having </v>
<v Speaker 3>lots of fun and I was thinking,</v>

2663
02:07:32.810 --> 02:07:33.320
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this,</v>

2664
02:07:33.320 --> 02:07:34.500
<v Speaker 3>oh this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2665
02:07:34.501 --> 02:07:37.270
<v Speaker 3>this is going to be enjoyable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then some I would just,</v>

2666
02:07:37.540 --> 02:07:40.600
<v Speaker 3>a wave of dread would wash over me and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>

2667
02:07:40.970 --> 02:07:42.550
<v Speaker 3>ended up start to feel like I was going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to vomit.</v>

2668
02:07:42.551 --> 02:07:43.990
<v Speaker 3>And then I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2669
02:07:43.991 --> 02:07:45.440
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to take this shit seriously.</v>

2670
02:07:45.441 --> 02:07:49.000
<v Speaker 3>And I'd sit upright and I'd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'd take a deep breath.</v>

2671
02:07:49.390 --> 02:07:50.223
<v Speaker 3>And that I can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think is what he's sort of talking </v>

2672
02:07:52.061 --> 02:07:52.491
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2673
02:07:52.491 --> 02:07:53.760
<v Speaker 3>And maybe that's like something like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2674
02:07:53.820 --> 02:07:54.653
<v Speaker 4>One of the things to make the really </v>
<v Speaker 4>powerful distinction is Mckenna was </v>

2675
02:07:57.520 --> 02:08:00.670
<v Speaker 4>specifically talking about dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what he was into.</v>

2676
02:08:00.700 --> 02:08:04.440
<v Speaker 4>She wasn't really into Iowasca.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His brother Dennis is really an Oscar.</v>

2677
02:08:04.450 --> 02:08:05.283
<v Speaker 4>And his brother Dennis really </v>
<v Speaker 4>recommended that I do it and I probably </v>

2678
02:08:07.571 --> 02:08:08.830
<v Speaker 4>will eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure it will,</v>

2679
02:08:09.220 --> 02:08:12.830
<v Speaker 4>but terrence was into the hardcore </v>
<v Speaker 4>version and it was.</v>

2680
02:08:12.840 --> 02:08:15.220
<v Speaker 4>It's a apparently you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2681
02:08:15.670 --> 02:08:17.820
<v Speaker 4>I know from the hardcore version of it </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not.</v>

2682
02:08:18.100 --> 02:08:21.040
<v Speaker 4>You're not escaping.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like once you're locked in,</v>

2683
02:08:21.340 --> 02:08:22.700
<v Speaker 4>you're gone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's.</v>

2684
02:08:22.701 --> 02:08:25.510
<v Speaker 4>It's way more potent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Way more potent.</v>

2685
02:08:25.511 --> 02:08:26.960
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to try it and see the difference.</v>

2686
02:08:27.200 --> 02:08:27.820
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2687
02:08:27.820 --> 02:08:28.653
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you're experiencing when you're </v>

2688
02:08:29.951 --> 02:08:30.784
<v Speaker 4>having the Iowasca trip is a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this emo a inhibitor allowing you to </v>

2689
02:08:36.401 --> 02:08:37.234
<v Speaker 4>have this prolonged slow release dmt </v>
<v Speaker 4>trip so you're not getting shot through </v>

2690
02:08:42.641 --> 02:08:45.370
<v Speaker 4>a fucking cannon to the center of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>universe.</v>

2691
02:08:45.450 --> 02:08:45.961
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

2692
02:08:45.961 --> 02:08:48.900
<v Speaker 3>But people have been using this for </v>
<v Speaker 3>thousands of years and believing that it</v>

2693
02:08:48.901 --> 02:08:51.750
<v Speaker 3>is opening a portal to some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>spirit of winter,</v>

2694
02:08:51.751 --> 02:08:52.400
<v Speaker 3>so it's not okay.</v>

2695
02:08:52.400 --> 02:08:53.233
<v Speaker 4>Saying there's a difference between what</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mckenna's describing as what you </v>

2696
02:08:55.451 --> 02:08:56.284
<v Speaker 4>experienced.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>

2697
02:08:56.390 --> 02:08:57.610
<v Speaker 4>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what I've experienced,</v>

2698
02:08:57.660 --> 02:08:58.493
<v Speaker 3>but presumably Mckenna's Mckenna's </v>
<v Speaker 3>theories can be extrapolated to Iowasca </v>

2699
02:09:01.830 --> 02:09:02.930
<v Speaker 3>as well as the MTA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

2700
02:09:02.940 --> 02:09:03.450
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2701
02:09:03.450 --> 02:09:04.140
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2702
02:09:04.140 --> 02:09:04.973
<v Speaker 3>definitely.</v>

2703
02:09:05.310 --> 02:09:06.143
<v Speaker 4>But I think that you're getting a much </v>
<v Speaker 4>more watered down version of it when </v>

2704
02:09:09.301 --> 02:09:10.134
<v Speaker 4>you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is one of the reasons why people </v>

2705
02:09:11.791 --> 02:09:13.620
<v Speaker 4>can sustain it for many,</v>
<v Speaker 4>many hours.</v>

2706
02:09:14.130 --> 02:09:15.690
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just trying to figure out what the,</v>

2707
02:09:15.750 --> 02:09:20.750
<v Speaker 3>what the competing claims about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this dimension that we're accessing A.</v>

2708
02:09:21.260 --> 02:09:21.770
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2709
02:09:21.770 --> 02:09:24.870
<v Speaker 3>on the one hand you've got a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a Penn Jillette who's saying,</v>

2710
02:09:24.900 --> 02:09:26.100
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just all in your district</v>

2711
02:09:26.110 --> 02:09:26.943
<v Speaker 4>guard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What he's saying.</v>

2712
02:09:27.250 --> 02:09:28.083
<v Speaker 4>He hasn't experienced it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If he experienced it and he was </v>

2713
02:09:29.651 --> 02:09:30.670
<v Speaker 4>dismissing it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would be like,</v>

2714
02:09:30.671 --> 02:09:32.140
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he must have got some weak shit.</v>

2715
02:09:32.350 --> 02:09:32.860
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2716
02:09:32.860 --> 02:09:33.430
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2717
02:09:33.430 --> 02:09:34.263
<v Speaker 3>what's compelling to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I was just saying about the </v>

2718
02:09:35.621 --> 02:09:38.800
<v Speaker 3>conclusions that people have after they </v>
<v Speaker 3>come off of these kinds of experiences.</v>

2719
02:09:39.130 --> 02:09:44.130
<v Speaker 3>No one has ever had one of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiences and come out of it and said,</v>

2720
02:09:44.860 --> 02:09:46.330
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really felt like I was.</v>

2721
02:09:46.360 --> 02:09:48.580
<v Speaker 3>I got an insight into the true meaning </v>
<v Speaker 3>of life.</v>

2722
02:09:48.581 --> 02:09:50.710
<v Speaker 3>And the meaning of life is I should hate</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jews.</v>

2723
02:09:51.130 --> 02:09:51.963
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or like no one has ever become more </v>

2724
02:09:53.501 --> 02:09:56.290
<v Speaker 3>petty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You all of the experiences.</v>

2725
02:09:56.890 --> 02:09:57.701
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not that I know of,</v>

2726
02:09:57.701 --> 02:10:01.930
<v Speaker 3>most certainly everyone who I know will </v>
<v Speaker 3>have or have read of who have had,</v>

2727
02:10:01.980 --> 02:10:02.813
<v Speaker 3>who've had these kinds of experiences </v>
<v Speaker 3>tend to come out with similar </v>

2728
02:10:05.650 --> 02:10:08.200
<v Speaker 3>intellectual conclusions that we are all</v>
<v Speaker 3>one.</v>

2729
02:10:08.560 --> 02:10:10.900
<v Speaker 3>That life is precious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2730
02:10:10.940 --> 02:10:11.773
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2731
02:10:11.950 --> 02:10:14.290
<v Speaker 3>consciousness is divine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that love is important.</v>

2732
02:10:14.320 --> 02:10:15.153
<v Speaker 3>All these kinds of things which </v>
<v Speaker 3>indicates to me that it's more that </v>

2733
02:10:19.301 --> 02:10:21.340
<v Speaker 3>makes it more plausible than it would </v>
<v Speaker 3>otherwise be.</v>

2734
02:10:21.370 --> 02:10:22.203
<v Speaker 3>That you're actually viewing something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that exists rather than merely having </v>

2735
02:10:25.811 --> 02:10:26.710
<v Speaker 3>your brain stood up</v>

2736
02:10:26.840 --> 02:10:27.673
<v Speaker 4>but isn't impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That just does just stripping away the </v>

2737
02:10:30.471 --> 02:10:35.300
<v Speaker 4>normal boundaries of consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>reveal the positive aspects of the human</v>

2738
02:10:35.301 --> 02:10:36.134
<v Speaker 4>nature and you take away all of our </v>
<v Speaker 4>insecurities and have all of our </v>

2739
02:10:40.220 --> 02:10:41.053
<v Speaker 4>biological necessity of survival and all</v>
<v Speaker 4>these different things that sort of </v>

2740
02:10:43.551 --> 02:10:47.750
<v Speaker 4>motivate us and sexual impulses and </v>
<v Speaker 4>desires and fears.</v>

2741
02:10:47.840 --> 02:10:48.673
<v Speaker 4>Strip all that stuff away with </v>
<v Speaker 4>dimethyltryptamine and all of a sudden </v>

2742
02:10:51.350 --> 02:10:54.620
<v Speaker 4>you reveal what the human soul really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>essentially.</v>

2743
02:10:54.650 --> 02:10:57.200
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but why is the human soul based on love?</v>

2744
02:10:57.800 --> 02:10:58.633
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because love is probably the thing that </v>

2745
02:11:00.591 --> 02:11:01.424
<v Speaker 4>makes us most connected and makes us </v>
<v Speaker 4>most productive and makes us feel the </v>

2746
02:11:05.271 --> 02:11:06.530
<v Speaker 4>best.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2747
02:11:06.710 --> 02:11:09.740
<v Speaker 4>you don't feel good if you're successful</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the loan.</v>

2748
02:11:10.130 --> 02:11:11.900
<v Speaker 4>It's one of the weirdest things about </v>
<v Speaker 4>being a person.</v>

2749
02:11:11.901 --> 02:11:12.734
<v Speaker 4>If you gave a person all the money in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the world and all the tools and toys in </v>

2750
02:11:15.171 --> 02:11:17.060
<v Speaker 4>the world and all the gadgets and </v>
<v Speaker 4>Gizmos,</v>

2751
02:11:17.270 --> 02:11:19.220
<v Speaker 4>but you left them by themselves on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>moon,</v>

2752
02:11:19.550 --> 02:11:21.470
<v Speaker 4>they'd probably want to blow their </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking brains out.</v>

2753
02:11:21.860 --> 02:11:22.520
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

2754
02:11:22.520 --> 02:11:26.420
<v Speaker 4>We don't exist in a vacuum.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We exist as a super organism.</v>

2755
02:11:26.660 --> 02:11:28.570
<v Speaker 4>This is something that Anthony Robbins </v>
<v Speaker 4>that make sense?</v>

2756
02:11:28.680 --> 02:11:30.450
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

2757
02:11:30.780 --> 02:11:32.130
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost.</v>

2758
02:11:32.740 --> 02:11:33.573
<v Speaker 3>It becomes back to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost semantic between that end </v>

2759
02:11:36.600 --> 02:11:38.160
<v Speaker 3>having an insight into another </v>
<v Speaker 3>dimension,</v>

2760
02:11:38.220 --> 02:11:42.660
<v Speaker 3>because if what you're saying is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamentally at the core of all of us,</v>

2761
02:11:42.720 --> 02:11:47.250
<v Speaker 3>once you strip everything else away is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of beating heart of deep,</v>

2762
02:11:47.340 --> 02:11:50.040
<v Speaker 3>glowing and abiding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>connected love.</v>

2763
02:11:50.820 --> 02:11:51.653
<v Speaker 3>We'll just call that the other dimension</v>
<v Speaker 3>then because that's spooky in and of </v>

2764
02:11:53.461 --> 02:11:53.900
<v Speaker 3>itself.</v>

2765
02:11:53.900 --> 02:11:56.840
<v Speaker 4>That other dimension would.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It feels like when you're doing dmt,</v>

2766
02:11:56.841 --> 02:11:59.130
<v Speaker 4>is that the way?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I describe it as it's you.</v>

2767
02:11:59.140 --> 02:11:59.973
<v Speaker 4>You're in this infinite realm of complex</v>
<v Speaker 4>geometric patterns that are made out of </v>

2768
02:12:03.711 --> 02:12:08.150
<v Speaker 4>love and understanding and that you and </v>
<v Speaker 4>by understanding I mean like wisdom,</v>

2769
02:12:08.151 --> 02:12:08.984
<v Speaker 4>like they see you can't bullshit them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're exposed Ra and what you are and </v>

2770
02:12:13.491 --> 02:12:14.324
<v Speaker 4>what you have been as exposed raw and </v>
<v Speaker 4>your personality and your life and your </v>

2771
02:12:17.181 --> 02:12:18.014
<v Speaker 4>culture is stripped away and you're left</v>
<v Speaker 4>with your soul or whatever we think of </v>

2772
02:12:21.921 --> 02:12:22.880
<v Speaker 4>as soul.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

2773
02:12:22.910 --> 02:12:24.410
<v Speaker 4>waited words,</v>
<v Speaker 4>weird words,</v>

2774
02:12:24.770 --> 02:12:25.603
<v Speaker 4>but ultimately that feeling of love does</v>
<v Speaker 4>come out of everybody like and I think </v>

2775
02:12:30.981 --> 02:12:31.814
<v Speaker 4>that that's probably at the root of what</v>
<v Speaker 4>makes us want to be connected with each </v>

2776
02:12:35.511 --> 02:12:36.344
<v Speaker 4>other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why you do feel bad when you're </v>

2777
02:12:37.760 --> 02:12:38.593
<v Speaker 4>just alone for long periods of time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't connect with people and it's </v>

2778
02:12:42.351 --> 02:12:43.184
<v Speaker 4>probably good to be alone occasionally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but ultimately you want to get back to </v>

2779
02:12:45.621 --> 02:12:46.454
<v Speaker 4>people and you want to get back to </v>
<v Speaker 4>people that you care about in the love </v>

2780
02:12:48.950 --> 02:12:50.000
<v Speaker 4>because you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

2781
02:12:50.060 --> 02:12:52.260
<v Speaker 4>you bond with them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You mom.</v>

2782
02:12:53.110 --> 02:12:53.943
<v Speaker 4>You do that thing that happens when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>go into the DMT world where you connect </v>

2783
02:12:56.481 --> 02:12:59.690
<v Speaker 4>with everything in it and it sucks you </v>
<v Speaker 4>in and as you let go,</v>

2784
02:12:59.940 --> 02:13:02.930
<v Speaker 4>it bathes you with that loving,</v>
<v Speaker 4>weird,</v>

2785
02:13:02.931 --> 02:13:04.790
<v Speaker 4>strange,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all knowing,</v>

2786
02:13:04.791 --> 02:13:05.624
<v Speaker 4>feeling</v>

2787
02:13:07.410 --> 02:13:11.550
<v Speaker 3>Anthony Robbins has an interesting line </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you reminded me of the beginning of</v>

2788
02:13:11.551 --> 02:13:12.384
<v Speaker 3>the show when you were talking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you were joking about how you'll </v>

2789
02:13:14.420 --> 02:13:16.920
<v Speaker 3>always feel unfulfilled and like you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know the moment you do a podcast,</v>

2790
02:13:16.921 --> 02:13:18.980
<v Speaker 3>you need to just focus on the next one </v>
<v Speaker 3>and get the next one done.</v>

2791
02:13:19.310 --> 02:13:20.143
<v Speaker 3>A which is that he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he feels like the greatest failures are </v>

2792
02:13:23.311 --> 02:13:25.290
<v Speaker 3>successful people who don't feel </v>
<v Speaker 3>fulfilled,</v>

2793
02:13:25.320 --> 02:13:26.153
<v Speaker 3>that he would much rather see an </v>
<v Speaker 3>unsuccessful fulfilled person than a </v>

2794
02:13:30.571 --> 02:13:32.190
<v Speaker 3>successful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unfulfilled</v>

2795
02:13:32.190 --> 02:13:33.023
<v Speaker 4>person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let me step in here because Anthony </v>

2796
02:13:36.380 --> 02:13:37.980
<v Speaker 4>Robins,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his greatest success,</v>

2797
02:13:38.430 --> 02:13:43.430
<v Speaker 4>Robin's his greatest success,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is teaching people to be successful.</v>

2798
02:13:43.980 --> 02:13:48.060
<v Speaker 4>So he must said to be fulfilled.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He must feel fulfilled.</v>

2799
02:13:48.480 --> 02:13:49.313
<v Speaker 4>Teaching people how to be successful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he would say that he teaches </v>

2800
02:13:52.141 --> 02:13:53.370
<v Speaker 4>them how to be fulfilled.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2801
02:13:53.910 --> 02:13:57.540
<v Speaker 4>What has he done?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What has he dies?</v>

2802
02:13:57.600 --> 02:13:59.940
<v Speaker 4>Teach people how to feel fulfilled.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2803
02:13:59.941 --> 02:14:01.650
<v Speaker 4>That's his vision of fulfillment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How much,</v>

2804
02:14:01.680 --> 02:14:05.250
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>amazing creative work of literature,</v>

2805
02:14:05.251 --> 02:14:06.084
<v Speaker 4>of fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of how much stuff has anthony robins </v>

2806
02:14:08.671 --> 02:14:09.990
<v Speaker 4>done?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many movies is he made?</v>

2807
02:14:09.991 --> 02:14:11.910
<v Speaker 4>How many,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how many paintings has he done?</v>

2808
02:14:11.940 --> 02:14:16.560
<v Speaker 4>How many things is he created out of?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nothing that he's super happy with.</v>

2809
02:14:17.320 --> 02:14:18.420
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his none.</v>

2810
02:14:18.421 --> 02:14:19.680
<v Speaker 4>His.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's not a creative artist.</v>

2811
02:14:19.681 --> 02:14:22.170
<v Speaker 4>His life mission is to help people get </v>
<v Speaker 4>fulfilled.</v>

2812
02:14:22.200 --> 02:14:26.520
<v Speaker 4>So him talking about creative people </v>
<v Speaker 4>being fulfilled.</v>

2813
02:14:27.180 --> 02:14:28.013
<v Speaker 4>Fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think he understands what I'm </v>

2814
02:14:30.601 --> 02:14:31.434
<v Speaker 4>saying.</v>

2815
02:14:31.560 --> 02:14:33.090
<v Speaker 4>Like am I fulfilled?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2816
02:14:33.091 --> 02:14:33.924
<v Speaker 4>I mean is it great that we have 830 </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever podcast in a bunch of people </v>

2817
02:14:36.971 --> 02:14:37.860
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely,</v>

2818
02:14:38.310 --> 02:14:41.100
<v Speaker 4>but what is fulfilled me and am I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>am I content?</v>

2819
02:14:41.101 --> 02:14:43.820
<v Speaker 4>Can I sit back and relax and enjoy it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2820
02:14:43.830 --> 02:14:44.663
<v Speaker 4>because part of what makes you good at </v>
<v Speaker 4>something is that you're constantly </v>

2821
02:14:48.271 --> 02:14:49.104
<v Speaker 4>assessing whether or not it's good and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're constantly objectively and </v>

2822
02:14:52.861 --> 02:14:56.580
<v Speaker 4>introspectively analyzing it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>breaking it down and chopping it up.</v>

2823
02:14:56.850 --> 02:14:57.683
<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just got through doing a Netflix </v>

2824
02:14:58.951 --> 02:14:59.784
<v Speaker 4>special.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going to air in October and I had </v>

2825
02:15:01.651 --> 02:15:04.860
<v Speaker 4>to edit it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking awful.</v>

2826
02:15:05.100 --> 02:15:05.933
<v Speaker 4>Doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chewing away at your work and trying to </v>

2827
02:15:08.641 --> 02:15:10.560
<v Speaker 4>figure out what you can do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's better.</v>

2828
02:15:10.561 --> 02:15:12.570
<v Speaker 4>Can I cut this out?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Should I leave this here?</v>

2829
02:15:12.720 --> 02:15:16.410
<v Speaker 4>And ultimately what I decided to do is I</v>
<v Speaker 4>did four shows so I could do one of them</v>

2830
02:15:16.411 --> 02:15:20.100
<v Speaker 4>almost completely in its entirety and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll like in and do it that way,</v>

2831
02:15:20.101 --> 02:15:22.230
<v Speaker 4>but I know other people think it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>funny.</v>

2832
02:15:22.230 --> 02:15:24.480
<v Speaker 4>I know the people that were there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got a standing ovation.</v>

2833
02:15:24.481 --> 02:15:26.580
<v Speaker 4>I know they loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I fucking hate everything.</v>

2834
02:15:26.940 --> 02:15:28.350
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't mean hate,</v>

2835
02:15:28.560 --> 02:15:29.393
<v Speaker 4>but I mean you're there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's a constant search for the </v>

2836
02:15:33.241 --> 02:15:34.074
<v Speaker 4>right beats and the right things and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not a matter of not being </v>

2837
02:15:36.481 --> 02:15:38.250
<v Speaker 4>fulfilled.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a very fulfilled person.</v>

2838
02:15:38.580 --> 02:15:41.490
<v Speaker 4>It's a matter of never really liking </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything that I do.</v>

2839
02:15:41.700 --> 02:15:42.533
<v Speaker 4>Never really loving it and they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>always this constant need to make it </v>

2840
02:15:45.781 --> 02:15:47.610
<v Speaker 4>better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This constant state of.</v>

2841
02:15:47.890 --> 02:15:48.723
<v Speaker 4>And the most people that I find that are</v>
<v Speaker 4>really super happy with everything they </v>

2842
02:15:51.691 --> 02:15:53.250
<v Speaker 4>do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they usually suck.</v>

2843
02:15:54.390 --> 02:15:55.800
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2844
02:15:55.830 --> 02:15:56.760
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm like you,</v>

2845
02:15:56.761 --> 02:15:57.594
<v Speaker 4>I never.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why it takes me forever to write </v>

2846
02:15:58.891 --> 02:16:03.110
<v Speaker 4>and I never meet writing deadlines </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I always hate what I want.</v>

2847
02:16:03.120 --> 02:16:06.120
<v Speaker 4>I produced why you're good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anthony Robbins is a great guy.</v>

2848
02:16:06.120 --> 02:16:06.953
<v Speaker 4>I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I appreciate him very much and I </v>

2849
02:16:08.130 --> 02:16:13.130
<v Speaker 4>listened to his motivational books on </v>
<v Speaker 4>tape when I was a fighter.</v>

2850
02:16:13.740 --> 02:16:14.573
<v Speaker 4>I used to listen to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have fucking one of those walkman </v>

2851
02:16:16.020 --> 02:16:20.340
<v Speaker 4>cassette things and I bought his books.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I listened to his stuff.</v>

2852
02:16:21.420 --> 02:16:24.030
<v Speaker 4>Ultimately though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is not to dismiss him,</v>

2853
02:16:24.360 --> 02:16:27.690
<v Speaker 4>what he does is write about success.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

2854
02:16:27.750 --> 02:16:28.583
<v Speaker 4>And he wants people to be successful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that's what he thinks of his </v>

2855
02:16:30.761 --> 02:16:31.594
<v Speaker 4>fulfillment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if Anthony robins decided to write </v>

2856
02:16:33.041 --> 02:16:35.230
<v Speaker 4>some great work of fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then I could listen to him.</v>

2857
02:16:35.670 --> 02:16:36.503
<v Speaker 4>Anthony Robbins sat down and came up </v>
<v Speaker 4>with this fucking amazing movie and </v>

2858
02:16:38.861 --> 02:16:41.740
<v Speaker 4>produced it and it's some saifai </v>
<v Speaker 4>masterpiece.</v>

2859
02:16:41.980 --> 02:16:43.780
<v Speaker 4>Then I could understand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's not doing that,</v>

2860
02:16:43.810 --> 02:16:44.643
<v Speaker 3>but don't coaches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this isn't the defendant Anthony </v>

2861
02:16:47.110 --> 02:16:47.943
<v Speaker 3>Robbins a hour,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but don't coach like you can be a great </v>

2862
02:16:51.191 --> 02:16:53.380
<v Speaker 3>coach without being good at the thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're coaching people on.</v>

2863
02:16:53.410 --> 02:16:55.420
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And sometimes that's useful to.</v>

2864
02:16:55.540 --> 02:16:56.300
<v Speaker 3>Oh sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2865
02:16:56.300 --> 02:17:00.070
<v Speaker 3>No screenwriting coaches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Robert Mckee runs his three day seminar.</v>

2866
02:17:00.071 --> 02:17:00.904
<v Speaker 3>Incredibly invaluable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If anyone wants to write a screenplay </v>

2867
02:17:02.750 --> 02:17:06.400
<v Speaker 3>who's out there do robot Mckay's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>seminar.</v>

2868
02:17:07.210 --> 02:17:09.340
<v Speaker 3>He's never written a screenplay in his </v>
<v Speaker 3>entire life.</v>

2869
02:17:09.400 --> 02:17:10.660
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not a good screen writer,</v>

2870
02:17:10.780 --> 02:17:13.510
<v Speaker 3>but he understands that he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's the first to say that,</v>

2871
02:17:13.690 --> 02:17:15.550
<v Speaker 3>but you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the big studios,</v>

2872
02:17:15.610 --> 02:17:17.010
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pay for their,</v>

2873
02:17:17.050 --> 02:17:18.850
<v Speaker 3>for their script readers to go to his </v>
<v Speaker 3>seminar.</v>

2874
02:17:18.910 --> 02:17:21.130
<v Speaker 3>You know where that doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stand up.</v>

2875
02:17:21.880 --> 02:17:22.713
<v Speaker 3>There are no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are no standup coaches that are </v>

2876
02:17:25.481 --> 02:17:26.590
<v Speaker 3>any good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2877
02:17:26.591 --> 02:17:28.930
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

2878
02:17:30.340 --> 02:17:32.380
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it weird?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's terrible.</v>

2879
02:17:32.381 --> 02:17:35.540
<v Speaker 3>Comedians that fail and then they start </v>
<v Speaker 3>to make stand.</v>

2880
02:17:35.580 --> 02:17:38.290
<v Speaker 3>It's like the standup class but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're like,</v>

2881
02:17:38.300 --> 02:17:39.310
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry,</v>

2882
02:17:39.311 --> 02:17:40.770
<v Speaker 3>what do you know about them?</v>

2883
02:17:40.920 --> 02:17:42.720
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you ever watched them do standup,</v>

2884
02:17:42.750 --> 02:17:43.583
<v Speaker 4>you want to fucking shoot yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a couple of people that wrote </v>

2885
02:17:46.471 --> 02:17:48.780
<v Speaker 4>books about standing up and they were </v>
<v Speaker 4>all awful,</v>

2886
02:17:48.950 --> 02:17:50.010
<v Speaker 4>awful comics.</v>

2887
02:17:50.220 --> 02:17:53.640
<v Speaker 3>There's one guy who was really helpful </v>
<v Speaker 3>to me when I started doing standup,</v>

2888
02:17:53.650 --> 02:17:56.070
<v Speaker 3>but not that I've ever been successful </v>
<v Speaker 3>at doing standup because I didn't pursue</v>

2889
02:17:56.071 --> 02:17:56.904
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he was really helpful to me in New </v>

2890
02:17:58.080 --> 02:18:00.210
<v Speaker 3>York when I first got there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But apart from that,</v>

2891
02:18:00.240 --> 02:18:01.740
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I completely agree.</v>

2892
02:18:01.760 --> 02:18:03.920
<v Speaker 3>It basically he was just a good joke </v>
<v Speaker 3>writer,</v>

2893
02:18:03.921 --> 02:18:06.900
<v Speaker 3>so he was good at whittling down a </v>
<v Speaker 3>concept into a punchline.</v>

2894
02:18:06.930 --> 02:18:08.520
<v Speaker 3>But the people that are good at.</v>

2895
02:18:08.860 --> 02:18:09.411
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you,</v>

2896
02:18:09.411 --> 02:18:10.244
<v Speaker 4>you could learn from friends,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I've never seen a really good comic </v>

2897
02:18:13.670 --> 02:18:15.570
<v Speaker 4>teach a course like David towels there.</v>

2898
02:18:15.740 --> 02:18:17.150
<v Speaker 3>You just stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>

2899
02:18:17.151 --> 02:18:18.350
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

2900
02:18:18.710 --> 02:18:22.580
<v Speaker 3>Well be yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean like I love the idea.</v>

2901
02:18:22.581 --> 02:18:23.414
<v Speaker 3>I've had so many conversations with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with successful creative people who I </v>

2902
02:18:26.901 --> 02:18:29.990
<v Speaker 3>admire that I couldn't believe that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>still ever doubt this advice,</v>

2903
02:18:30.080 --> 02:18:32.750
<v Speaker 3>but it's the most consistent advice that</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get from creative people.</v>

2904
02:18:32.751 --> 02:18:33.584
<v Speaker 3>I like anytime they try to do something </v>
<v Speaker 3>which is calculated to appeal to a </v>

2905
02:18:39.441 --> 02:18:40.274
<v Speaker 3>particular demographic or which is based</v>
<v Speaker 3>on notes that other people have given </v>

2906
02:18:42.801 --> 02:18:45.320
<v Speaker 3>them or which is intended to fill a </v>
<v Speaker 3>particular niche,</v>

2907
02:18:45.710 --> 02:18:46.543
<v Speaker 3>it falls flat on its face and every time</v>
<v Speaker 3>they do something that is for them that </v>

2908
02:18:50.211 --> 02:18:52.550
<v Speaker 3>they love,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that has an audience of one,</v>

2909
02:18:52.850 --> 02:18:53.683
<v Speaker 3>which is them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's true to them and it speaks to </v>

2910
02:18:55.791 --> 02:18:58.130
<v Speaker 3>them and it's idiosyncratic and </v>
<v Speaker 3>particular.</v>

2911
02:18:58.640 --> 02:19:00.290
<v Speaker 3>It kills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so true.</v>

2912
02:19:00.291 --> 02:19:01.060
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

2913
02:19:01.060 --> 02:19:04.780
<v Speaker 4>here's the rub.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to learn how to be yourself.</v>

2914
02:19:05.050 --> 02:19:07.630
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that takes a long fucking time.</v>

2915
02:19:07.760 --> 02:19:08.593
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think back when I was 21 when I first </v>

2916
02:19:10.421 --> 02:19:11.254
<v Speaker 4>started doing standup and I'm horrified </v>
<v Speaker 4>that anybody let me onstage because I </v>

2917
02:19:16.301 --> 02:19:18.580
<v Speaker 4>didn't know anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know who I was.</v>

2918
02:19:18.581 --> 02:19:21.040
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know what my thoughts on things</v>
<v Speaker 4>were.</v>

2919
02:19:21.310 --> 02:19:24.490
<v Speaker 4>I was just terrified trying to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>laughs.</v>

2920
02:19:24.670 --> 02:19:27.680
<v Speaker 4>So I was trying to figure out what would</v>
<v Speaker 4>make people laugh.</v>

2921
02:19:28.100 --> 02:19:28.933
<v Speaker 4>I had no idea what I thought was funny </v>
<v Speaker 4>other than what I saw that made me </v>

2922
02:19:31.941 --> 02:19:33.860
<v Speaker 4>laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't break it down.</v>

2923
02:19:34.250 --> 02:19:38.360
<v Speaker 4>Like if I went to see a Sam kinison or </v>
<v Speaker 4>Jerry Seinfeld or something like that,</v>

2924
02:19:38.570 --> 02:19:41.360
<v Speaker 4>I knew they were hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They made me laugh.</v>

2925
02:19:41.361 --> 02:19:43.730
<v Speaker 4>I could repeat the joke to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can say,</v>

2926
02:19:43.760 --> 02:19:45.260
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw Seinfeld.</v>

2927
02:19:45.261 --> 02:19:47.180
<v Speaker 4>Let me tell you his joke and I could </v>
<v Speaker 4>tell you.</v>

2928
02:19:47.181 --> 02:19:50.780
<v Speaker 4>And I knew it was funny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I didn't know how to do it.</v>

2929
02:19:51.250 --> 02:19:52.083
<v Speaker 4>I just clumsily concocted my own </v>
<v Speaker 4>versions of different subjects that I </v>

2930
02:19:58.341 --> 02:20:01.850
<v Speaker 4>thought could possibly be funny and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>over time,</v>

2931
02:20:01.851 --> 02:20:04.700
<v Speaker 4>slowly but surely figured out how to </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually be funny,</v>

2932
02:20:04.970 --> 02:20:05.803
<v Speaker 4>but along the lines I had a fail </v>
<v Speaker 4>miserably and learn and feel pain and </v>

2933
02:20:09.830 --> 02:20:13.640
<v Speaker 4>heartbreak and all the bullshit that </v>
<v Speaker 4>people go to before I started forming my</v>

2934
02:20:13.641 --> 02:20:15.410
<v Speaker 4>own actual opinions on things.</v>

2935
02:20:15.550 --> 02:20:18.530
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a really good point </v>
<v Speaker 3>because sometimes one day I was,</v>

2936
02:20:18.550 --> 02:20:23.350
<v Speaker 3>I was a late bloomer and figuring out </v>
<v Speaker 3>who I am as a creative person.</v>

2937
02:20:23.380 --> 02:20:25.990
<v Speaker 3>Do you know now I don't know what the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck I am.</v>

2938
02:20:26.040 --> 02:20:26.830
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2939
02:20:26.830 --> 02:20:29.470
<v Speaker 3>to to her closest approximation that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're able to,</v>

2940
02:20:30.260 --> 02:20:31.093
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're able to land so your </v>

2941
02:20:32.950 --> 02:20:35.110
<v Speaker 3>audience knows who Joe Rogan is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Put it that way.</v>

2942
02:20:35.111 --> 02:20:36.580
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's enough.</v>

2943
02:20:36.640 --> 02:20:39.340
<v Speaker 3>Some of them do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of them are mad.</v>

2944
02:20:39.341 --> 02:20:44.341
<v Speaker 3>I thought you were different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think fun of ignore them,</v>

2945
02:20:44.480 --> 02:20:45.313
<v Speaker 3>make fun of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My mother was like reading the comments </v>

2946
02:20:46.991 --> 02:20:47.824
<v Speaker 3>section of a website,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it I think some of sometimes one of </v>

2947
02:20:51.281 --> 02:20:52.114
<v Speaker 3>the differences between people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>peaked early into successful young </v>

2948
02:20:54.701 --> 02:20:55.534
<v Speaker 3>versus people who are better later in </v>
<v Speaker 3>life is just how just how long does it </v>

2949
02:20:58.271 --> 02:20:59.104
<v Speaker 3>take you to really get grounded in who </v>
<v Speaker 3>you are and to stop trying on these </v>

2950
02:21:03.341 --> 02:21:04.174
<v Speaker 3>different kind of invisible cloaks of </v>
<v Speaker 3>personalities that you think you might </v>

2951
02:21:06.941 --> 02:21:09.850
<v Speaker 3>be until you can strip all that away and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you're like,</v>

2952
02:21:09.851 --> 02:21:10.960
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think this is.</v>

2953
02:21:11.470 --> 02:21:13.600
<v Speaker 3>I think this is the real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the same with podcasting as well.</v>

2954
02:21:13.601 --> 02:21:14.434
<v Speaker 3>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to host stuff and try to get it </v>

2955
02:21:16.631 --> 02:21:20.560
<v Speaker 3>up and do radio bits in Australia and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>if I listened back to them now,</v>

2956
02:21:20.800 --> 02:21:22.600
<v Speaker 3>it's so effected.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so.</v>

2957
02:21:22.601 --> 02:21:23.434
<v Speaker 3>It's so not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so me trying to be me on radio </v>

2958
02:21:26.180 --> 02:21:28.060
<v Speaker 3>instead of just made.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2959
02:21:29.470 --> 02:21:31.480
<v Speaker 3>you gotta be you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2960
02:21:31.940 --> 02:21:32.773
<v Speaker 4>I think the thing that happens also with</v>
<v Speaker 4>the peaking early thing is success </v>

2961
02:21:35.961 --> 02:21:36.794
<v Speaker 4>itself is the poison or of creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A success itself like you all of a </v>

2962
02:21:42.751 --> 02:21:43.584
<v Speaker 4>sudden you have it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the reasons why I don't </v>

2963
02:21:45.201 --> 02:21:47.830
<v Speaker 4>believe Anthony Robbins is correct,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is like this,</v>

2964
02:21:47.840 --> 02:21:51.140
<v Speaker 4>this idea of like being satisfied and </v>
<v Speaker 4>being fulfilled.</v>

2965
02:21:51.141 --> 02:21:52.130
<v Speaker 4>Like I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sure,</v>

2966
02:21:52.131 --> 02:21:54.590
<v Speaker 4>I'm satisfied and fulfilled.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

2967
02:21:54.591 --> 02:21:55.424
<v Speaker 4>But the whole thing about the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this creative process is you can never </v>

2968
02:22:00.471 --> 02:22:01.304
<v Speaker 4>totally be happy with what you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>or what you've done because you've got </v>

2969
02:22:04.691 --> 02:22:07.010
<v Speaker 4>to do more shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Especially standups.</v>

2970
02:22:07.011 --> 02:22:10.730
<v Speaker 4>Like if you're a musician and you're the</v>
<v Speaker 4>rolling stones and you have a catalog.</v>

2971
02:22:10.940 --> 02:22:12.440
<v Speaker 4>Fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could tour forever.</v>

2972
02:22:12.650 --> 02:22:15.500
<v Speaker 4>You don't need to write a new song ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you're a standup,</v>

2973
02:22:15.830 --> 02:22:18.950
<v Speaker 4>I put out a new special every year and a</v>
<v Speaker 4>half every two years,</v>

2974
02:22:18.951 --> 02:22:21.110
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if I don't do that,</v>

2975
02:22:21.111 --> 02:22:25.320
<v Speaker 4>I feel like a fucking piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if I try to do the same jokes,</v>

2976
02:22:25.440 --> 02:22:26.160
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>five</v>

2977
02:22:26.160 --> 02:22:29.220
<v Speaker 2>years in a row,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six years in a row,</v>

2978
02:22:29.221 --> 02:22:32.070
<v Speaker 2>10 years in a row,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all know comics that do that.</v>

2979
02:22:32.071 --> 02:22:32.904
<v Speaker 2>You go to see them and they're doing the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same bits word for word for decades and </v>

2980
02:22:36.840 --> 02:22:39.890
<v Speaker 2>decades and never put anything out that </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't go for the.</v>

2981
02:22:39.900 --> 02:22:42.220
<v Speaker 2>I got back to the comedy cellar in New </v>
<v Speaker 2>York sometimes in the,</v>

2982
02:22:42.230 --> 02:22:43.063
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the emcee will be doing the same shtick </v>

2983
02:22:43.891 --> 02:22:46.170
<v Speaker 2>that he was doing 10 years ago when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>first came to New York.</v>

2984
02:22:46.171 --> 02:22:47.004
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy is still doing the same </v>

2985
02:22:48.391 --> 02:22:50.190
<v Speaker 2>material.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2986
02:22:50.550 --> 02:22:54.420
<v Speaker 2>in one respect I can sort of understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>it because if you're like take music,</v>

2987
02:22:54.421 --> 02:22:56.780
<v Speaker 2>maybe not the rolling stones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but say Hansard,</v>

2988
02:22:57.120 --> 02:23:00.030
<v Speaker 2>you can just do embalm every single time</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go anyway.</v>

2989
02:23:00.031 --> 02:23:01.870
<v Speaker 2>And that's all you need to do for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rest of your life.</v>

2990
02:23:02.460 --> 02:23:05.810
<v Speaker 2>And in comedy there are people like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like sometimes audiences want it,</v>

2991
02:23:05.820 --> 02:23:06.030
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2992
02:23:06.030 --> 02:23:08.990
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I'll do that bit about blahdy </v>
<v Speaker 2>Blah.</v>

2993
02:23:10.100 --> 02:23:12.000
<v Speaker 2>Grandma sucks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is fine.</v>

2994
02:23:12.150 --> 02:23:12.983
<v Speaker 2>You mean Jerry Seinfeld did that one </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing I'm telling you for the last time </v>

2995
02:23:16.570 --> 02:23:19.200
<v Speaker 2>I saw him and Sydney.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2996
02:23:19.230 --> 02:23:20.550
<v Speaker 2>Nothing wrong with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2997
02:23:20.630 --> 02:23:21.463
<v Speaker 2>but then he tied all of that material.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like if you go to see a guy like </v>

2998
02:23:24.811 --> 02:23:27.960
<v Speaker 2>bill burr,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see bill burger special and then you</v>

2999
02:23:27.961 --> 02:23:32.961
<v Speaker 2>go see him like a year later you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna see a whole new set every time.</v>

3000
02:23:33.540 --> 02:23:36.350
<v Speaker 2>And that's the same with Ari Shaffir at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same,</v>

3001
02:23:36.400 --> 02:23:37.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fill in the blank,</v>

3002
02:23:37.450 --> 02:23:41.250
<v Speaker 2>yet every single essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean touring comedian now,</v>

3003
02:23:41.400 --> 02:23:42.233
<v Speaker 2>to be fair to Anthony Robbins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that he's saying that you </v>

3004
02:23:44.161 --> 02:23:47.220
<v Speaker 2>should just be sit on your laurels and </v>
<v Speaker 2>not strive.</v>

3005
02:23:47.221 --> 02:23:48.480
<v Speaker 2>And it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

3006
02:23:48.660 --> 02:23:49.493
<v Speaker 2>What he's saying is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will know the story of like the person </v>

3007
02:23:51.601 --> 02:23:55.020
<v Speaker 2>who wanted a Ferrari and wanting to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wanting to sexy wife and wanted the best</v>

3008
02:23:55.021 --> 02:23:55.854
<v Speaker 2>job and wanting to make a million </v>
<v Speaker 2>dollars and then gets it and finds </v>

3009
02:23:58.561 --> 02:24:01.950
<v Speaker 2>themselves miserable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>connected to exactly.</v>

3010
02:24:01.950 --> 02:24:03.300
<v Speaker 2>They're not connected to what they </v>
<v Speaker 2>really want.</v>

3011
02:24:03.301 --> 02:24:06.810
<v Speaker 2>That's what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't mean being self satisfied.</v>

3012
02:24:06.811 --> 02:24:07.644
<v Speaker 2>It means he means being genuinely </v>
<v Speaker 2>fulfilled by the things that you're </v>

3013
02:24:10.410 --> 02:24:11.243
<v Speaker 2>aspiring to do with your life and to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>up to in the world where there are a </v>

3014
02:24:14.671 --> 02:24:15.504
<v Speaker 2>bunch of things that we think we want </v>
<v Speaker 2>and what they are is really just these </v>

3015
02:24:18.361 --> 02:24:21.570
<v Speaker 2>unattainable goals that seem like </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're unattainable.</v>

3016
02:24:21.571 --> 02:24:22.710
<v Speaker 2>And then once we attain them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we go,</v>

3017
02:24:22.711 --> 02:24:23.640
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well the now what?</v>

3018
02:24:23.670 --> 02:24:24.503
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what happens to a lot of </v>

3019
02:24:25.231 --> 02:24:28.830
<v Speaker 2>people when they get famous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of comics in particular,</v>

3020
02:24:29.040 --> 02:24:33.150
<v Speaker 2>they become famous and they are really </v>
<v Speaker 2>good when they become famous,</v>

3021
02:24:33.151 --> 02:24:36.450
<v Speaker 2>like kinisons of my favorite all time </v>
<v Speaker 2>example because I've,</v>

3022
02:24:36.451 --> 02:24:40.460
<v Speaker 2>I believe that Kennison from like 1984 </v>
<v Speaker 2>to 1986,</v>

3023
02:24:40.461 --> 02:24:42.030
<v Speaker 2>it was probably the greatest comic of </v>
<v Speaker 2>all time.</v>

3024
02:24:42.390 --> 02:24:44.940
<v Speaker 2>There was just a time where he was just </v>
<v Speaker 2>a maniac.</v>

3025
02:24:45.130 --> 02:24:47.460
<v Speaker 2>He just was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's hard because you've got to kind</v>

3026
02:24:47.461 --> 02:24:48.294
<v Speaker 2>of put it in the context of the time </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there was no one like that back </v>

3027
02:24:50.341 --> 02:24:51.174
<v Speaker 2>then because comedy is not like music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you go listening to music from the </v>

3028
02:24:55.921 --> 02:24:58.350
<v Speaker 2>19 sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's still really awesome.</v>

3029
02:24:58.710 --> 02:25:01.530
<v Speaker 2>Go try to listen to some mort Sahl from </v>
<v Speaker 2>1960.</v>

3030
02:25:01.531 --> 02:25:03.680
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean that more.</v>

3031
02:25:03.710 --> 02:25:05.910
<v Speaker 2>Saul's not a brilliant comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's certainly was.</v>

3032
02:25:06.030 --> 02:25:08.820
<v Speaker 2>Or Lenny Bruce Who's like the godfather </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the whole thing.</v>

3033
02:25:09.010 --> 02:25:09.843
<v Speaker 2>If it wasn't for Lenny Bruce,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one today would be doing the same </v>

3034
02:25:12.181 --> 02:25:13.450
<v Speaker 2>kind of standup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>

3035
02:25:13.530 --> 02:25:14.690
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't have existed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3036
02:25:14.691 --> 02:25:15.524
<v Speaker 2>it's an art form that almost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he in many ways sort of gave birth </v>

3037
02:25:19.471 --> 02:25:20.430
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3038
02:25:20.490 --> 02:25:22.770
<v Speaker 2>go listen to that stuff today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't hold up.</v>

3039
02:25:23.260 --> 02:25:24.310
<v Speaker 2>Comedy doesn't necessarily</v>

3040
02:25:24.310 --> 02:25:25.143
<v Speaker 4>hold up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So in some ways kinison doesn't totally </v>

3041
02:25:27.161 --> 02:25:27.994
<v Speaker 4>hold up when you go back and understand </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I'm a bit hard to grasp from </v>

3042
02:25:31.031 --> 02:25:34.540
<v Speaker 4>today's vantage point I must say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but during the time,</v>

3043
02:25:34.600 --> 02:25:36.160
<v Speaker 4>this is a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've told this story before,</v>

3044
02:25:36.161 --> 02:25:39.010
<v Speaker 4>unfortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So everybody who heard it gather around,</v>

3045
02:25:39.550 --> 02:25:40.383
<v Speaker 4>there was a girl that I worked with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was working at the Boston Athletic </v>

3046
02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:43.833
<v Speaker 4>Club.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was 19 years old and there was this </v>

3047
02:25:44.741 --> 02:25:47.140
<v Speaker 4>girl that was working at the front desk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was hilarious.</v>

3048
02:25:47.141 --> 02:25:50.590
<v Speaker 4>She was like really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like this big athletic girl.</v>

3049
02:25:50.591 --> 02:25:54.400
<v Speaker 4>And she was just always like boys jurist</v>
<v Speaker 4>and joking around about stuff.</v>

3050
02:25:54.401 --> 02:25:55.234
<v Speaker 4>And she was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really wish I stayed in touch with </v>

3051
02:25:56.471 --> 02:25:57.380
<v Speaker 4>her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

3052
02:25:58.290 --> 02:26:00.250
<v Speaker 4>I don't know her name anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember her name,</v>

3053
02:26:00.280 --> 02:26:03.160
<v Speaker 4>but our member,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she told me about Sam Kennison.</v>

3054
02:26:03.161 --> 02:26:03.994
<v Speaker 4>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw this comedian on Hbo and now </v>

3055
02:26:05.111 --> 02:26:06.130
<v Speaker 4>granted this is the back.</v>

3056
02:26:06.130 --> 02:26:08.290
<v Speaker 4>And then there was like Hbo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fox,</v>

<v Speaker 4>On the parking lot on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's lying on her stomach</v>

<v Speaker 7>going,</v>

<v Speaker 7>ends.</v>

3097
02:27:45.510 --> 02:27:46.343
<v Speaker 4>I am laughing my ass off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this girl doing this in the parking </v>

3098
02:27:48.991 --> 02:27:53.991
<v Speaker 4>lot and I went out and I believe I got </v>
<v Speaker 4>it on vhs cassette because again,</v>

3099
02:27:54.151 --> 02:27:54.984
<v Speaker 4>this is 86.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was before I'd ever done standup and </v>

3100
02:27:58.380 --> 02:28:03.180
<v Speaker 4>I watched his hbo special and I went,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>

3101
02:28:03.181 --> 02:28:05.930
<v Speaker 4>Like I didn't even know that was comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know someone could.</v>

3102
02:28:05.990 --> 02:28:08.220
<v Speaker 4>I thought comedy was evening at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Improv.</v>

3103
02:28:08.400 --> 02:28:12.530
<v Speaker 4>Guys would roll up their sleeves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you ever notice set up punchline?</v>

3104
02:28:12.540 --> 02:28:13.373
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this guy was doing this completely </v>

3105
02:28:15.480 --> 02:28:19.920
<v Speaker 4>radical version of that with a bra on </v>
<v Speaker 4>and a trench coat.</v>

3106
02:28:20.340 --> 02:28:21.860
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the is this,</v>

3107
02:28:22.310 --> 02:28:23.143
<v Speaker 4>and he was so good for a short period of</v>
<v Speaker 4>time and then I went to see him alive </v>

3108
02:28:28.130 --> 02:28:28.963
<v Speaker 4>when I first got into comedy around 1988</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he had already slid way off the </v>

3109
02:28:33.501 --> 02:28:34.334
<v Speaker 4>rails and he was just partying all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>time and doing coke and bang and </v>

3110
02:28:37.761 --> 02:28:38.480
<v Speaker 4>strippers.</v>

3111
02:28:38.480 --> 02:28:40.190
<v Speaker 4>He's on heroin as well with me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3112
02:28:40.400 --> 02:28:41.233
<v Speaker 4>I don't believe so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he's pretty much just a coca </v>

3113
02:28:43.100 --> 02:28:45.620
<v Speaker 4>probably did heroin probably did </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything you put in front of them.</v>

3114
02:28:45.690 --> 02:28:47.540
<v Speaker 4>You know Sam Kennison.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was an animal.</v>

3115
02:28:48.050 --> 02:28:50.930
<v Speaker 4>He even joked around about that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about people expected them to do drugs.</v>

3116
02:28:51.770 --> 02:28:52.740
<v Speaker 4>He's here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's here,</v>

3117
02:28:52.741 --> 02:28:53.574
<v Speaker 4>could cut the biggest line in the world </v>
<v Speaker 4>and even doing his heart would be </v>

3118
02:28:55.880 --> 02:28:58.250
<v Speaker 4>beating out of his chest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to say no.</v>

3119
02:28:59.280 --> 02:29:00.113
<v Speaker 4>Well also it would be bad for his image.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He sort of became a prisoner of his own </v>

3120
02:29:04.820 --> 02:29:05.653
<v Speaker 4>image.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He created this persona and then it </v>

3121
02:29:06.921 --> 02:29:07.754
<v Speaker 4>became a prisoner to that persona,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he just stopped writing and stopped </v>

3122
02:29:10.821 --> 02:29:11.654
<v Speaker 4>being funny and he's hanging out with </v>
<v Speaker 4>celebrities and he's going to parties </v>

3123
02:29:13.821 --> 02:29:16.790
<v Speaker 4>and he's not not hungry anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not doing the work.</v>

3124
02:29:16.791 --> 02:29:17.624
<v Speaker 4>And he went from being one of the best </v>
<v Speaker 4>ever to being like an open mic or is </v>

3125
02:29:21.231 --> 02:29:23.240
<v Speaker 4>caricature of who he really was.</v>

3126
02:29:23.270 --> 02:29:27.360
<v Speaker 4>We really didn't have any points and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>was all just scream and all just,</v>

3127
02:29:27.830 --> 02:29:28.663
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like trying to pick out a shocking </v>

3128
02:29:30.051 --> 02:29:31.490
<v Speaker 4>subject.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it wasn't really.</v>

3129
02:29:31.760 --> 02:29:33.530
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't really resonate with them.</v>

3130
02:29:33.980 --> 02:29:37.430
<v Speaker 4>And I think with a lot of Comedians,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's really important is a,</v>

3131
02:29:37.431 --> 02:29:39.780
<v Speaker 4>you are a regular person that you are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just,</v>

3132
02:29:39.980 --> 02:29:40.813
<v Speaker 4>you can fit in with people and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand people and a lot of people </v>

3133
02:29:44.121 --> 02:29:47.870
<v Speaker 4>they become famous and then all of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>sudden they get assistance and then they</v>

3134
02:29:47.871 --> 02:29:48.621
<v Speaker 4>get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3135
02:29:48.621 --> 02:29:50.930
<v Speaker 4>managers and agents shield them from the</v>
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>

3136
02:29:50.931 --> 02:29:51.764
<v Speaker 4>They have publicists to do all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking for them and they get tucked </v>

3137
02:29:54.171 --> 02:29:55.004
<v Speaker 4>away in an ivory tower and then they </v>
<v Speaker 4>show up for interviews with sunglasses </v>

3138
02:29:57.831 --> 02:29:58.820
<v Speaker 4>on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

3139
02:29:58.821 --> 02:30:01.460
<v Speaker 4>and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're all about maintaining.</v>

3140
02:30:01.660 --> 02:30:02.493
<v Speaker 3>Tell me about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've interviewed enough of those on the </v>

3141
02:30:03.820 --> 02:30:04.391
<v Speaker 3>live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3142
02:30:04.391 --> 02:30:05.051
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3143
02:30:05.051 --> 02:30:08.290
<v Speaker 3>not even necessarily Comedians,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but people who come on with that persona</v>

3144
02:30:08.320 --> 02:30:10.270
<v Speaker 3>who are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who are handled,</v>

3145
02:30:10.271 --> 02:30:12.130
<v Speaker 3>who have spent their entire lives being </v>
<v Speaker 3>handled.</v>

3146
02:30:13.480 --> 02:30:14.470
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>give me an example.</v>

3147
02:30:15.360 --> 02:30:18.280
<v Speaker 3>Roseanne Barr.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I brought her in here.</v>

3148
02:30:18.281 --> 02:30:19.420
<v Speaker 3>She was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was She?</v>

3149
02:30:19.570 --> 02:30:20.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she got.</v>

3150
02:30:20.800 --> 02:30:22.430
<v Speaker 3>Well you probably got her to open up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had,</v>

3151
02:30:22.640 --> 02:30:24.010
<v Speaker 3>I had 25 minutes.</v>

3152
02:30:24.290 --> 02:30:27.230
<v Speaker 4>Well I had three hours and she knows I'm</v>
<v Speaker 4>a huge fan.</v>

3153
02:30:27.290 --> 02:30:32.290
<v Speaker 4>I think Roseanne is probably one of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>10 most important comedian.</v>

3154
02:30:32.800 --> 02:30:33.521
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

3155
02:30:33.521 --> 02:30:34.354
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm a huge fan of actually the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you see the documentary film that </v>

3156
02:30:36.761 --> 02:30:39.040
<v Speaker 3>was made about her run for president?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3157
02:30:39.350 --> 02:30:40.890
<v Speaker 3>it's actually really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

3158
02:30:40.891 --> 02:30:41.724
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fascinating to see this person who </v>

3159
02:30:44.531 --> 02:30:45.364
<v Speaker 3>was so groundbreaking and who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who did so much comedy in for and for I </v>

3160
02:30:49.871 --> 02:30:54.370
<v Speaker 3>guess the portrayal of women and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people and the working class on American</v>

3161
02:30:54.371 --> 02:30:56.620
<v Speaker 3>television wasn't totally different </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

3162
02:30:56.630 --> 02:30:57.960
<v Speaker 3>She was a totally different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3163
02:30:57.980 --> 02:31:00.430
<v Speaker 3>Just see her kind of puttering around </v>
<v Speaker 3>her home in Hawaii,</v>

3164
02:31:00.460 --> 02:31:02.770
<v Speaker 3>like trying to run for president as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>green candidate.</v>

3165
02:31:02.910 --> 02:31:04.840
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an interesting documentary.</v>

3166
02:31:04.990 --> 02:31:07.160
<v Speaker 3>She had to set her straight about chem </v>
<v Speaker 3>trail.</v>

3167
02:31:07.161 --> 02:31:10.780
<v Speaker 3>She believed the government was spraying</v>
<v Speaker 3>things in the sky reading.</v>

3168
02:31:11.200 --> 02:31:14.160
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I read about that and maybe you </v>
<v Speaker 3>tweeted about it or something,</v>

3169
02:31:14.170 --> 02:31:15.003
<v Speaker 3>but I remember reading about her and </v>
<v Speaker 3>chem trails or maybe it was Brian </v>

3170
02:31:18.790 --> 02:31:20.820
<v Speaker 3>Dunning's episode or did he reference </v>
<v Speaker 3>that or something?</v>

3171
02:31:20.910 --> 02:31:22.530
<v Speaker 3>There was something maybe skeptical.</v>

3172
02:31:22.630 --> 02:31:24.400
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he might've.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3173
02:31:24.850 --> 02:31:26.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's too many of them.</v>

3174
02:31:26.540 --> 02:31:29.710
<v Speaker 2>They get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I really remember it at all.</v>

3175
02:31:29.711 --> 02:31:31.360
<v Speaker 2>You know Dunbar's number.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's.</v>

3176
02:31:31.630 --> 02:31:32.463
<v Speaker 2>There's only like certain amount of data</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can stuff in that fucking dome of </v>

3177
02:31:35.051 --> 02:31:35.980
<v Speaker 2>yours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

3178
02:31:36.100 --> 02:31:37.480
<v Speaker 2>And let it go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who Cares?</v>

3179
02:31:37.481 --> 02:31:41.140
<v Speaker 2>Who gives a shit how many homes it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she was awesome on this show and she</v>

3180
02:31:41.141 --> 02:31:43.510
<v Speaker 2>didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She didn't come in like handled it all.</v>

3181
02:31:43.840 --> 02:31:46.050
<v Speaker 2>She came in by herself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sat down,</v>

3182
02:31:46.060 --> 02:31:47.320
<v Speaker 2>shot the shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>laughed,</v>

3183
02:31:47.321 --> 02:31:48.154
<v Speaker 2>joked around.</v>

3184
02:31:48.190 --> 02:31:49.023
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean fame you or met you were talking </v>

3185
02:31:50.681 --> 02:31:51.514
<v Speaker 3>earlier about fame.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it can be incredibly alienating </v>

3186
02:31:54.641 --> 02:31:57.100
<v Speaker 3>when you reach a certain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's your sweet spot of fame?</v>

3187
02:31:57.101 --> 02:31:58.120
<v Speaker 3>Because I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3188
02:31:58.121 --> 02:31:58.670
<v Speaker 3>I think I hit it</v>

3189
02:31:58.670 --> 02:31:59.930
<v Speaker 2>about a year and a half ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying,</v>

3190
02:32:02.060 --> 02:32:04.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanna be able to go to the movies.</v>

3191
02:32:04.370 --> 02:32:05.203
<v Speaker 3>I can't think of anything worse than not</v>
<v Speaker 3>being able to get on a plane without </v>

3192
02:32:08.690 --> 02:32:09.523
<v Speaker 3>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I got on a plane a couple of years </v>

3193
02:32:11.251 --> 02:32:14.670
<v Speaker 3>ago and Deniro was sitting in seat one </v>
<v Speaker 3>Aa,</v>

3194
02:32:14.680 --> 02:32:17.100
<v Speaker 3>so I don't know how he got on the plane,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how long he'd been on the plane,</v>

3195
02:32:17.101 --> 02:32:19.390
<v Speaker 3>but he wasn't here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't see him board.</v>

3196
02:32:19.430 --> 02:32:22.580
<v Speaker 3>So I know Richie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

3197
02:32:22.620 --> 02:32:23.453
<v Speaker 3>we got on the plane</v>

3198
02:32:24.610 --> 02:32:26.580
<v Speaker 2>already there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no fucking idea.</v>

3199
02:32:26.610 --> 02:32:27.980
<v Speaker 2>He was already on the plane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like yeah,</v>

3200
02:32:28.030 --> 02:32:29.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm in the front of the line,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bitch,</v>

3201
02:32:30.270 --> 02:32:31.260
<v Speaker 2>get on that plane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lionel.</v>

3202
02:32:31.340 --> 02:32:34.400
<v Speaker 3>So I was one of the first people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>was one of the first people on the plane</v>

3203
02:32:34.700 --> 02:32:37.430
<v Speaker 3>and I also happened to be in first class</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the.</v>

3204
02:32:37.520 --> 02:32:40.080
<v Speaker 3>And you hack your way into first class?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You son of them.</v>

3205
02:32:40.081 --> 02:32:40.914
<v Speaker 3>That actually someone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a production company paid for me that I </v>

3206
02:32:42.351 --> 02:32:43.910
<v Speaker 3>was shooting a pilot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3207
02:32:43.911 --> 02:32:44.744
<v Speaker 3>and so I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was one of the first people on the </v>

3208
02:32:46.581 --> 02:32:47.414
<v Speaker 3>plane and I was able to see the </v>
<v Speaker 3>reactions of everybody walking past as </v>

3209
02:32:49.821 --> 02:32:50.654
<v Speaker 3>they notice or don't notice that it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>Robert Deniro sitting on the plane and </v>

3210
02:32:54.680 --> 02:32:55.513
<v Speaker 3>it's incredible to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean his life is just a relentless </v>

3211
02:32:58.851 --> 02:33:02.090
<v Speaker 3>stream of people acting weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3212
02:33:02.091 --> 02:33:02.924
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every single person who noticed him </v>

3213
02:33:04.251 --> 02:33:05.084
<v Speaker 3>would do a double take gospel nudge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unsubtly nudge the person who they're </v>

3214
02:33:09.260 --> 02:33:14.260
<v Speaker 3>traveling with and he has to sit there </v>
<v Speaker 3>reading the newspaper,</v>

3215
02:33:14.700 --> 02:33:19.700
<v Speaker 3>pretending that this is normal and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>can say hello to him.</v>

3216
02:33:20.550 --> 02:33:22.340
<v Speaker 3>But what a horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>normal one.</v>

3217
02:33:22.341 --> 02:33:25.370
<v Speaker 3>If you want to pick your nose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't pick your nose in public.</v>

3218
02:33:25.371 --> 02:33:28.270
<v Speaker 3>You piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lot.</v>

3219
02:33:28.610 --> 02:33:30.480
<v Speaker 3>Have a good pick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't a good picture?</v>

3220
02:33:30.510 --> 02:33:31.430
<v Speaker 3>Satisfying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Weird.</v>

3221
02:33:31.431 --> 02:33:34.760
<v Speaker 3>How many people up dry up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get a big old dry.</v>

3222
02:33:34.761 --> 02:33:36.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You realize that there's more up there.</v>

3223
02:33:36.561 --> 02:33:39.940
<v Speaker 3>You kind of pull out a pc of Brian </v>
<v Speaker 3>almost just goes all the way up to,</v>

3224
02:33:40.100 --> 02:33:41.510
<v Speaker 3>in between your eyes are agree.</v>

3225
02:33:41.710 --> 02:33:42.680
<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3226
02:33:42.760 --> 02:33:44.740
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's got to be weird to be that famous.</v>

3227
02:33:44.750 --> 02:33:46.300
<v Speaker 2>So there's certain levels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a buddy of mine,</v>

3228
02:33:46.301 --> 02:33:49.480
<v Speaker 2>his friend Doug Stanhope is friends with</v>
<v Speaker 2>Johnny Depp and uh,</v>

3229
02:33:49.510 --> 02:33:50.343
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he talks about how unmanageable Johnny </v>

3230
02:33:53.350 --> 02:33:56.260
<v Speaker 2>Depp's famous like he cannot go to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he goes to a restaurant,</v>

3231
02:33:56.261 --> 02:33:58.150
<v Speaker 2>literally people do not give a fuck if </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's eating,</v>

3232
02:33:58.151 --> 02:33:58.984
<v Speaker 2>they swarm and the table and come over </v>
<v Speaker 2>with cameras and pictures and they want </v>

3233
02:34:02.021 --> 02:34:03.850
<v Speaker 2>to touch him and they don't leave him </v>
<v Speaker 2>alone.</v>

3234
02:34:03.920 --> 02:34:04.753
<v Speaker 2>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just far beyond the regular fame </v>

3235
02:34:08.140 --> 02:34:10.600
<v Speaker 2>into that weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's only 10 people in the world that</v>

3236
02:34:10.601 --> 02:34:13.060
<v Speaker 2>have that kind of fame.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you become other people's property.</v>

3237
02:34:13.170 --> 02:34:14.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically.</v>

3238
02:34:14.650 --> 02:34:18.040
<v Speaker 2>And they feel like you owe them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think television,</v>

3239
02:34:18.070 --> 02:34:19.420
<v Speaker 1>maybe movie stars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3240
02:34:19.480 --> 02:34:23.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure how it would play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think in my experience,</v>

3241
02:34:23.620 --> 02:34:25.630
<v Speaker 1>broadcasters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in other words,</v>

3242
02:34:25.631 --> 02:34:30.631
<v Speaker 1>television personalities and radio hosts</v>
<v Speaker 1>are people feel like you're their friend</v>

3243
02:34:31.810 --> 02:34:34.180
<v Speaker 1>in a way that they don't to movie stars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3244
02:34:34.181 --> 02:34:35.014
<v Speaker 1>So there's a different interplay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like people movie stars are different </v>

3245
02:34:37.031 --> 02:34:39.010
<v Speaker 1>because they play someone different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3246
02:34:39.011 --> 02:34:42.400
<v Speaker 1>oh my gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy from Cape fear raging bull.</v>

3247
02:34:42.401 --> 02:34:43.234
<v Speaker 1>That's Jake Lamata the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's something about the bigness </v>

3248
02:34:46.121 --> 02:34:46.954
<v Speaker 1>of the screen and the Glamor of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood that makes them sort of other </v>

3249
02:34:48.931 --> 02:34:50.080
<v Speaker 1>worldly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3250
02:34:50.140 --> 02:34:52.270
<v Speaker 1>Whereas when people go up to Jimmy </v>
<v Speaker 1>Fallon,</v>

3251
02:34:52.510 --> 02:34:53.710
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh Jimmy,</v>

3252
02:34:53.960 --> 02:34:54.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

3253
02:34:54.700 --> 02:34:55.520
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're my buddy.</v>

3254
02:34:55.520 --> 02:34:57.460
<v Speaker 1>Like we should hang out sometime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3255
02:34:57.630 --> 02:34:58.780
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly it,</v>

3256
02:34:59.590 --> 02:35:03.040
<v Speaker 1>but I think there's a sweet spot to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to fame that as you say,</v>

3257
02:35:03.041 --> 02:35:06.490
<v Speaker 1>I would not want to go past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to be more famous than I am,</v>

3258
02:35:06.610 --> 02:35:09.490
<v Speaker 1>but not not so famous that I can't pick </v>
<v Speaker 1>my nose in public.</v>

3259
02:35:09.490 --> 02:35:10.323
<v Speaker 1>That's the judge sets level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Definitely shouldn't pick your nose in </v>

3260
02:35:11.591 --> 02:35:14.890
<v Speaker 1>public to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to your alone grandmother.</v>

3261
02:35:15.400 --> 02:35:19.360
<v Speaker 1>Don't stop chastising me for my boogers </v>
<v Speaker 1>in front of all these humans.</v>

3262
02:35:19.390 --> 02:35:22.800
<v Speaker 1>I've got my fist up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my nose right now to my wrist.</v>

3263
02:35:22.930 --> 02:35:24.510
<v Speaker 1>I was sitting next to this guy on an </v>
<v Speaker 1>airplane once.</v>

3264
02:35:24.511 --> 02:35:26.770
<v Speaker 1>This old dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just kept digging in his nose.</v>

3265
02:35:26.771 --> 02:35:28.100
<v Speaker 1>He didn't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3266
02:35:28.130 --> 02:35:30.700
<v Speaker 1>that's not about 75 years old and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3267
02:35:30.760 --> 02:35:32.390
<v Speaker 1>nobody's fucking me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do it.</v>

3268
02:35:32.400 --> 02:35:34.120
<v Speaker 1>One more time happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a shit,</v>

3269
02:35:34.121 --> 02:35:36.000
<v Speaker 1>and he was in first class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had some cash.</v>

3270
02:35:36.010 --> 02:35:39.090
<v Speaker 1>He just fucking up there weighty wipe </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

3271
02:35:39.520 --> 02:35:40.353
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just stopped looking at them and put </v>

3272
02:35:41.321 --> 02:35:42.770
<v Speaker 1>my headphones on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>zoned out.</v>

3273
02:35:42.810 --> 02:35:44.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm tired of looking at this old dude </v>
<v Speaker 1>picking his nose.</v>

3274
02:35:44.861 --> 02:35:49.861
<v Speaker 1>He fired a bunch of times to household.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So about just letting that go.</v>

3275
02:35:55.980 --> 02:35:59.640
<v Speaker 3>I've had some bad experiences on Greg </v>
<v Speaker 3>Fitzsimmons has a bit about that,</v>

3276
02:35:59.641 --> 02:36:00.720
<v Speaker 3>about how he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3277
02:36:00.721 --> 02:36:01.554
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he's in first class you always to </v>

3278
02:36:02.570 --> 02:36:05.670
<v Speaker 3>gets upgraded because he flies so much </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we was in first class and needed to</v>

3279
02:36:05.671 --> 02:36:07.800
<v Speaker 3>fought but didn't want to stink at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>first class cabin.</v>

3280
02:36:08.100 --> 02:36:08.933
<v Speaker 3>So He'd go back through the curtain to </v>
<v Speaker 3>economy class and just walk down the </v>

3281
02:36:11.521 --> 02:36:12.354
<v Speaker 3>aisle fighting</v>

3282
02:36:13.330 --> 02:36:18.010
<v Speaker 1>that's cropped up and then he'd go back </v>
<v Speaker 1>to first class,</v>

3283
02:36:18.170 --> 02:36:19.030
<v Speaker 1>smart life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those,</v>

3284
02:36:19.090 --> 02:36:19.923
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those people in cattle class at </v>

3285
02:36:20.771 --> 02:36:22.520
<v Speaker 1>disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It smells like hell back there.</v>

3286
02:36:22.580 --> 02:36:25.070
<v Speaker 1>Joey Diaz always farts in first class </v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

3287
02:36:25.071 --> 02:36:28.100
<v Speaker 1>It's always so horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can imagine.</v>

3288
02:36:28.250 --> 02:36:30.800
<v Speaker 1>I wrote a whole bit about Joey farting </v>
<v Speaker 1>in first class.</v>

3289
02:36:30.801 --> 02:36:35.020
<v Speaker 1>I wrote a whole blog entry about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>one time that he did that.</v>

3290
02:36:35.520 --> 02:36:37.570
<v Speaker 1>This woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she yelled at him,</v>

3291
02:36:37.990 --> 02:36:40.910
<v Speaker 1>he had fallen and she yelled out behind </v>
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

3292
02:36:41.240 --> 02:36:46.240
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She yelled it out.</v>

3293
02:36:46.640 --> 02:36:51.500
<v Speaker 1>I put my shirt over my nose like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he started laughing and clapping.</v>

3294
02:36:55.550 --> 02:36:55.820
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

3295
02:36:55.820 --> 02:36:57.710
<v Speaker 3>I've occasionally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will confess,</v>

3296
02:36:57.711 --> 02:36:58.544
<v Speaker 3>I've occasionally been too hung over on </v>
<v Speaker 3>a plane and have not been able to hold </v>

3297
02:37:01.791 --> 02:37:04.190
<v Speaker 3>it in and I've got a little trick for </v>
<v Speaker 3>people which they can keep up.</v>

3298
02:37:04.191 --> 02:37:06.430
<v Speaker 3>This leaves and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go to the bathroom.</v>

3299
02:37:06.530 --> 02:37:08.220
<v Speaker 3>Rude piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes you're,</v>

3300
02:37:08.270 --> 02:37:10.790
<v Speaker 3>sometimes you're in the window seat and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the person sitting next to you is eating</v>

3301
02:37:10.791 --> 02:37:12.790
<v Speaker 3>their meal or something and you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you kind of get out.</v>

3302
02:37:12.810 --> 02:37:13.643
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to disturb things and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not sure if it's going to smelly </v>

3303
02:37:15.471 --> 02:37:16.040
<v Speaker 3>or not and you're</v>

3304
02:37:16.040 --> 02:37:16.873
<v Speaker 1>not sure if it's going to be big or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just going to be something has to </v>

3305
02:37:19.100 --> 02:37:23.840
<v Speaker 1>give and so here's the tactic so that no</v>
<v Speaker 1>one will suspect you.</v>

3306
02:37:25.040 --> 02:37:25.873
<v Speaker 1>You release it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You survived through the beginning of </v>

3307
02:37:29.331 --> 02:37:32.150
<v Speaker 1>the horrible smell without paying any </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to it.</v>

3308
02:37:32.750 --> 02:37:36.350
<v Speaker 1>Then as soon as it would have had time </v>
<v Speaker 1>to have gotten to you,</v>

3309
02:37:36.770 --> 02:37:39.290
<v Speaker 1>if it had been admitted by someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>nearby,</v>

3310
02:37:40.460 --> 02:37:44.570
<v Speaker 1>then you very visibly start to react to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bad smell.</v>

3311
02:37:44.960 --> 02:37:45.793
<v Speaker 1>You don't understand light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a strategy that has been hired </v>

3312
02:37:49.060 --> 02:37:54.060
<v Speaker 1>by American children for it is called.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He smelt it.</v>

3313
02:37:54.531 --> 02:37:59.350
<v Speaker 1>Dealt it so this is not so new.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It should be the first no one white.</v>

3314
02:37:59.430 --> 02:38:02.960
<v Speaker 1>You white until the person sitting next </v>
<v Speaker 1>to you starts to wince.</v>

3315
02:38:03.190 --> 02:38:04.023
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then once they win and then you go </v>

3316
02:38:04.880 --> 02:38:07.280
<v Speaker 1>up because then the trajectory can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>established.</v>

3317
02:38:07.280 --> 02:38:08.113
<v Speaker 1>If they win first and then you wince,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's obviously coming from the </v>

3318
02:38:09.891 --> 02:38:11.310
<v Speaker 1>other side of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3319
02:38:11.330 --> 02:38:12.163
<v Speaker 1>you're going to give away these like </v>
<v Speaker 1>micro expressions that are going to </v>

3320
02:38:13.851 --> 02:38:16.160
<v Speaker 1>reveal your guilt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not because I'm a perfect doctor.</v>

3321
02:38:16.730 --> 02:38:19.880
<v Speaker 1>The perfect crime by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not.</v>

3322
02:38:19.980 --> 02:38:24.350
<v Speaker 1>None of my fucking face shot themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I loudly say,</v>

3323
02:38:24.480 --> 02:38:26.720
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe someone was sad,</v>

3324
02:38:26.840 --> 02:38:29.480
<v Speaker 1>disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's tough fights in this cabin and that</v>

3325
02:38:29.481 --> 02:38:31.010
<v Speaker 1>person wasn't me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3326
02:38:31.190 --> 02:38:32.023
<v Speaker 1>it's the woman behind Joey Diaz that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>really foreign and when she smelled his </v>

3327
02:38:35.481 --> 02:38:37.550
<v Speaker 1>foreign,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she made it even worse and I was blaming</v>

3328
02:38:37.551 --> 02:38:39.380
<v Speaker 1>it all on Joey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but her yelling out,</v>

3329
02:38:39.410 --> 02:38:43.010
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll never forget that lady,</v>

3330
02:38:43.520 --> 02:38:44.353
<v Speaker 1>that poor lady I love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love the audacity that she's not </v>

3331
02:38:47.241 --> 02:38:50.900
<v Speaker 1>embarrassed about it because it wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>let you have the Oh,</v>

3332
02:38:50.960 --> 02:38:54.080
<v Speaker 1>nearly you have the tact to be a bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>embarrassed about for the,</v>

3333
02:38:54.090 --> 02:38:55.610
<v Speaker 1>on behalf of the fighter.</v>

3334
02:38:55.700 --> 02:39:00.700
<v Speaker 1>When you understand what kind of fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>smell Joey Diaz can pack in that body.</v>

3335
02:39:01.970 --> 02:39:02.803
<v Speaker 1>You're talking with a man who is well </v>
<v Speaker 1>over 300 pounds and who knows what he </v>

3336
02:39:07.650 --> 02:39:08.483
<v Speaker 1>ate a small child who was fighting </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside him and now he's fighting the </v>

3337
02:39:11.770 --> 02:39:14.980
<v Speaker 1>fight happening many things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3338
02:39:15.170 --> 02:39:16.003
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to mention also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was reading this piece about stem </v>

3339
02:39:18.891 --> 02:39:19.724
<v Speaker 1>cells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you been paying attention to the </v>

3340
02:39:20.450 --> 02:39:22.070
<v Speaker 1>fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3341
02:39:22.610 --> 02:39:26.840
<v Speaker 1>it looks now like we're going to be able</v>
<v Speaker 1>to use stem cells to grow.</v>

3342
02:39:27.680 --> 02:39:28.513
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we always knew you'd be able to grow </v>

3343
02:39:29.571 --> 02:39:30.680
<v Speaker 1>organs in a lab,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3344
02:39:31.520 --> 02:39:32.353
<v Speaker 1>But now it looks like within the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fussiest future we're going to be able </v>

3345
02:39:35.961 --> 02:39:39.560
<v Speaker 1>to grow a hearts and essentially grow </v>
<v Speaker 1>hots in a lab.</v>

3346
02:39:39.590 --> 02:39:42.350
<v Speaker 1>And you're not gonna have to worry about</v>
<v Speaker 1>stem cell treatments.</v>

3347
02:39:42.380 --> 02:39:43.410
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talk to me.</v>

3348
02:39:43.670 --> 02:39:44.271
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3349
02:39:44.271 --> 02:39:46.010
<v Speaker 1>was that close to shoulder surgery.</v>

3350
02:39:46.460 --> 02:39:50.180
<v Speaker 1>I had a tear in my rotator cuff tear in </v>
<v Speaker 1>my labor room,</v>

3351
02:39:50.210 --> 02:39:51.043
<v Speaker 1>a tear in my bicep tendon and my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my shoulder was in some pretty </v>

3352
02:39:53.721 --> 02:39:54.554
<v Speaker 1>significant pain and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this from a particular injury or is </v>

3353
02:39:56.771 --> 02:40:00.440
<v Speaker 1>this just from Geneva to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's from martial arts.</v>

3354
02:40:00.441 --> 02:40:03.560
<v Speaker 1>It's from weightlifting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's from years ago.</v>

3355
02:40:03.561 --> 02:40:05.090
<v Speaker 1>Overall wear and tear of being Joe </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rogan.</v>

3356
02:40:05.091 --> 02:40:08.320
<v Speaker 1>When I got the MRI apparently in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulder had been dislocated.</v>

3357
02:40:08.350 --> 02:40:09.183
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know it and it popped back in </v>
<v Speaker 1>place at one point in time and they saw </v>

3358
02:40:12.291 --> 02:40:14.160
<v Speaker 1>there's some particles that are floating</v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

3359
02:40:14.390 --> 02:40:15.223
<v Speaker 4>Jujitsu is just unbelievably brutal on </v>
<v Speaker 4>your body because you're constantly </v>

3360
02:40:18.151 --> 02:40:18.984
<v Speaker 4>attacking joints and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and trying to break those joints and </v>

3361
02:40:21.151 --> 02:40:22.920
<v Speaker 4>then you have to tap but you don't want </v>
<v Speaker 4>to tap.</v>

3362
02:40:22.921 --> 02:40:23.754
<v Speaker 4>So you muscled through it and then you </v>
<v Speaker 4>wind up getting pretty injured and then </v>

3363
02:40:26.680 --> 02:40:27.513
<v Speaker 4>you heal up for a little bit and you hop</v>
<v Speaker 4>right back in and train again because </v>

3364
02:40:29.371 --> 02:40:31.140
<v Speaker 4>it's so much fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

3365
02:40:31.141 --> 02:40:31.974
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was really close to getting shoulder </v>

3366
02:40:32.821 --> 02:40:33.654
<v Speaker 4>surgery and I talked to the doctor from </v>
<v Speaker 4>the UFC who had just gotten these stem </v>

3367
02:40:37.861 --> 02:40:40.500
<v Speaker 4>cell injections in his shoulder after </v>
<v Speaker 4>surgery.</v>

3368
02:40:40.501 --> 02:40:41.334
<v Speaker 4>He had shoulder surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 4>had a shoulder repaired and then gotten </v>

3369
02:40:43.621 --> 02:40:47.340
<v Speaker 4>these injections and I had some pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pretty good results with it.</v>

3370
02:40:47.341 --> 02:40:48.180
<v Speaker 4>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

3371
02:40:48.480 --> 02:40:51.510
<v Speaker 4>you really probably need surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you want to try this,</v>

3372
02:40:51.810 --> 02:40:54.360
<v Speaker 4>these injections,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's give it a shot because it has been</v>

3373
02:40:54.361 --> 02:40:54.750
<v Speaker 4>shown.</v>

3374
02:40:54.750 --> 02:40:55.950
<v Speaker 4>I just don't want to give you any false </v>
<v Speaker 4>hope.</v>

3375
02:40:56.250 --> 02:40:57.300
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's give it a shot.</v>

3376
02:40:57.540 --> 02:41:00.210
<v Speaker 4>So what they do is they take a woman's </v>
<v Speaker 4>placenta that,</v>

3377
02:41:00.211 --> 02:41:01.044
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is a given birth to a kid through </v>

3378
02:41:02.701 --> 02:41:06.300
<v Speaker 4>Sicilian section and then a young woman </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they take those,</v>

3379
02:41:06.330 --> 02:41:09.810
<v Speaker 4>that placenta and then they get these </v>
<v Speaker 4>embryonic stem cells from it.</v>

3380
02:41:09.870 --> 02:41:12.270
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they injected it into my shoulder.</v>

3381
02:41:12.510 --> 02:41:15.570
<v Speaker 4>And within four weeks I felt better than</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've felt in a year.</v>

3382
02:41:15.810 --> 02:41:18.540
<v Speaker 4>And then it kept getting better and </v>
<v Speaker 4>better and better.</v>

3383
02:41:18.541 --> 02:41:19.620
<v Speaker 4>And now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3384
02:41:19.621 --> 02:41:20.454
<v Speaker 4>there's still some clicking like because</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's still some shit floating around </v>

3385
02:41:23.491 --> 02:41:24.750
<v Speaker 4>in there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

3386
02:41:25.160 --> 02:41:28.230
<v Speaker 4>I lift a lot of weights and I don't have</v>
<v Speaker 4>any pain.</v>

3387
02:41:28.530 --> 02:41:31.350
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's amazing how much better it got.</v>

3388
02:41:31.351 --> 02:41:32.184
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did a kickboxing workout today where </v>

3389
02:41:33.510 --> 02:41:35.010
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went seven rounds on the.</v>

3390
02:41:35.160 --> 02:41:36.510
<v Speaker 4>So I'm slamming into the back.</v>

3391
02:41:36.640 --> 02:41:38.580
<v Speaker 4>I have no pain in my shoulder at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nothing.</v>

3392
02:41:38.581 --> 02:41:39.414
<v Speaker 4>Zero.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's stuff floating around in </v>

3393
02:41:40.801 --> 02:41:41.431
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I said,</v>

3394
02:41:41.431 --> 02:41:42.151
<v Speaker 4>I could feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go,</v>

3395
02:41:42.151 --> 02:41:42.631
<v Speaker 4>click,</v>
<v Speaker 4>click,</v>

3396
02:41:42.631 --> 02:41:45.630
<v Speaker 4>click because there's some broken off </v>
<v Speaker 4>cartilage and shit.</v>

3397
02:41:45.631 --> 02:41:46.440
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I'll.</v>

3398
02:41:46.440 --> 02:41:48.300
<v Speaker 4>Maybe I'll have to get pulled out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>there one day.</v>

3399
02:41:48.510 --> 02:41:50.550
<v Speaker 4>But there's no pain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no,</v>

3400
02:41:50.640 --> 02:41:55.560
<v Speaker 4>there's no limit in my range of motion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no strength problem.</v>

3401
02:41:55.561 --> 02:41:59.160
<v Speaker 4>Like I've shown the doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the physical exercises I can do and</v>

3402
02:41:59.161 --> 02:42:00.120
<v Speaker 4>he's blown away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

3403
02:42:00.121 --> 02:42:00.954
<v Speaker 4>that is incredible because it just </v>
<v Speaker 4>regenerates tissue and it can </v>

3404
02:42:03.241 --> 02:42:05.700
<v Speaker 4>regenerate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It can regenerate meniscus,</v>

3405
02:42:05.910 --> 02:42:07.610
<v Speaker 4>it can regenerate ligaments.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

3406
02:42:07.930 --> 02:42:09.460
<v Speaker 3>it's incumbent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anything.</v>

3407
02:42:09.550 --> 02:42:11.260
<v Speaker 3>Exactly thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3408
02:42:11.261 --> 02:42:13.240
<v Speaker 3>think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You had an injury,</v>

3409
02:42:13.270 --> 02:42:14.103
<v Speaker 3>you had a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you had a debilitating injury that was </v>

3410
02:42:15.941 --> 02:42:18.820
<v Speaker 3>causing you significant discomfort and </v>
<v Speaker 3>pain.</v>

3411
02:42:19.630 --> 02:42:20.463
<v Speaker 3>What science was able to do is take the </v>
<v Speaker 3>cells that we're going to form the </v>

3412
02:42:24.161 --> 02:42:24.994
<v Speaker 3>spinal cord of a baby from an embryo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and those cells were then able to </v>

3413
02:42:32.531 --> 02:42:35.110
<v Speaker 3>convert themselves into portions of Joe </v>
<v Speaker 3>Rogan's,</v>

3414
02:42:35.111 --> 02:42:35.944
<v Speaker 3>different constituent components in </v>
<v Speaker 3>order to rebuild a portion of Joe's </v>

3415
02:42:38.621 --> 02:42:40.720
<v Speaker 3>body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy shit.</v>

3416
02:42:40.721 --> 02:42:43.300
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if that miraculous.</v>

3417
02:42:43.301 --> 02:42:45.370
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there are some things coming down</v>

3418
02:42:45.371 --> 02:42:48.760
<v Speaker 3>the pike with stem cells that are going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to change everything.</v>

3419
02:42:48.800 --> 02:42:48.970
<v Speaker 3>I</v>

3420
02:42:48.970 --> 02:42:51.260
<v Speaker 4>mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm literally made the cost.</v>

3421
02:42:51.520 --> 02:42:54.850
<v Speaker 4>Like if I had gotten this injury five </v>
<v Speaker 4>years ago,</v>

3422
02:42:54.851 --> 02:42:57.190
<v Speaker 4>I would've had to have surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I didn't.</v>

3423
02:42:57.280 --> 02:43:00.310
<v Speaker 4>I got it now and now there's no need for</v>
<v Speaker 4>surgery.</v>

3424
02:43:00.400 --> 02:43:02.620
<v Speaker 4>Like my shoulders.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a shoot.</v>

3425
02:43:02.621 --> 02:43:03.470
<v Speaker 4>Archery,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

3426
02:43:03.490 --> 02:43:04.430
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I shoot a,</v>

3427
02:43:04.490 --> 02:43:08.980
<v Speaker 4>I pull 80 pounds 100 times a day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I'm just going,</v>

3428
02:43:09.760 --> 02:43:11.620
<v Speaker 4>nope.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No shoulder pain at nothing.</v>

3429
02:43:12.790 --> 02:43:13.623
<v Speaker 2>Zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you watch the artery and the </v>

3430
02:43:14.051 --> 02:43:15.280
<v Speaker 2>Olympics?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did watch some of it.</v>

3431
02:43:15.320 --> 02:43:16.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fun.</v>

3432
02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:17.530
<v Speaker 2>The lcs got silver,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that.</v>

3433
02:43:17.620 --> 02:43:18.940
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you fucking papers.</v>

3434
02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:22.510
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're into ourselves.</v>

3435
02:43:22.720 --> 02:43:27.460
<v Speaker 2>I've just watched the NBC telecast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gave up on the very humble swimmer,</v>

3436
02:43:27.461 --> 02:43:30.340
<v Speaker 2>lied.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gave up Ryan lochte.</v>

3437
02:43:30.370 --> 02:43:33.760
<v Speaker 2>He had poor fella.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a bit of a music bit of a Bogan,</v>

3438
02:43:33.761 --> 02:43:34.950
<v Speaker 2>isn't he?</v>
<v Speaker 2>As we were saying in Australia,</v>

3439
02:43:35.070 --> 02:43:35.903
<v Speaker 2>that's what you guys were calling me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I thought was hilarious </v>

3440
02:43:37.271 --> 02:43:38.890
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that how people were,</v>

3441
02:43:38.910 --> 02:43:39.743
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3442
02:43:40.090 --> 02:43:44.290
<v Speaker 2>I think it was salon had some article </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's proof that white male athletes</v>

3443
02:43:44.710 --> 02:43:45.543
<v Speaker 2>are pieces of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they had this whole thing about </v>

3444
02:43:47.681 --> 02:43:50.620
<v Speaker 2>white male athletes like Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think you can generalize.</v>

3445
02:43:50.890 --> 02:43:51.723
<v Speaker 2>One person can die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you imagine if they'd said this is </v>

3446
02:43:54.461 --> 02:43:56.080
<v Speaker 2>proof that like if it was an African </v>
<v Speaker 2>American,</v>

3447
02:43:56.081 --> 02:43:56.914
<v Speaker 2>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were like black women or black </v>

3448
02:43:59.021 --> 02:44:00.000
<v Speaker 2>women are of shit.</v>

3449
02:44:00.010 --> 02:44:02.200
<v Speaker 2>That would've been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would've been really fun.</v>

3450
02:44:02.290 --> 02:44:05.590
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing that people are allowed to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way it was written.</v>

3451
02:44:05.591 --> 02:44:07.420
<v Speaker 2>The article was not written by a white </v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3452
02:44:07.780 --> 02:44:10.010
<v Speaker 2>It was written by someone else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's amazing that,</v>

3453
02:44:10.011 --> 02:44:12.030
<v Speaker 2>that you could do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can.</v>

3454
02:44:12.190 --> 02:44:13.023
<v Speaker 2>You can be sexist as long as you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>being sexist about any can be racist as </v>

3455
02:44:17.171 --> 02:44:18.004
<v Speaker 2>long as you're being sexist and racist </v>
<v Speaker 2>about a class that you believe is </v>

3456
02:44:21.881 --> 02:44:24.160
<v Speaker 2>privileged,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're allowed to punch up.</v>

3457
02:44:24.210 --> 02:44:25.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should always punch.</v>

3458
02:44:25.601 --> 02:44:26.490
<v Speaker 2>Always Punch out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>

3459
02:44:26.520 --> 02:44:29.190
<v Speaker 2>We were talking about yesterday with </v>
<v Speaker 2>nonsense.</v>

3460
02:44:29.250 --> 02:44:33.050
<v Speaker 2>That's the illness that punch up shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is God dammit.</v>

3461
02:44:33.070 --> 02:44:34.810
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so annoying,</v>

3462
02:44:34.811 --> 02:44:35.644
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's especially annoying because I </v>

3463
02:44:36.431 --> 02:44:38.800
<v Speaker 3>understand the motivation behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3464
02:44:38.801 --> 02:44:41.750
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do believe that it's different if you.</v>

3465
02:44:41.751 --> 02:44:42.584
<v Speaker 3>If there's a genuinely oppressed </v>
<v Speaker 3>minority than it's different than they </v>

3466
02:44:46.181 --> 02:44:48.310
<v Speaker 3>should have more of a license to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>fun,</v>

3467
02:44:48.311 --> 02:44:51.430
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the majority than the majority should</v>

3468
02:44:51.790 --> 02:44:53.110
<v Speaker 3>on them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At least it's less.</v>

3469
02:44:53.170 --> 02:44:54.550
<v Speaker 3>I can understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's less bad.</v>

3470
02:44:54.910 --> 02:44:55.743
<v Speaker 3>What I've done on the stand is when </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're allowed to show flagrant </v>

3471
02:44:59.650 --> 02:45:00.910
<v Speaker 3>bigotry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3472
02:45:00.970 --> 02:45:01.990
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's not,</v>

3473
02:45:01.991 --> 02:45:04.220
<v Speaker 3>it's not just like a gag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like.</v>

3474
02:45:04.900 --> 02:45:08.620
<v Speaker 3>So did you see there was a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is slightly tangential,</v>

3475
02:45:08.621 --> 02:45:10.550
<v Speaker 3>but everyone got their knickers in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>knot.</v>

3476
02:45:10.551 --> 02:45:12.820
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that tits and the tangle about that.</v>

3477
02:45:13.120 --> 02:45:13.953
<v Speaker 3>A headline,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think it was in the San Jose </v>

3478
02:45:15.431 --> 02:45:19.570
<v Speaker 3>Mercury when Michael Phelps won his </v>
<v Speaker 3>final,</v>

3479
02:45:19.600 --> 02:45:20.433
<v Speaker 3>do you see that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was this tokenistic kind of </v>

3480
02:45:22.120 --> 02:45:23.740
<v Speaker 3>patronizing headline,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was like,</v>

3481
02:45:23.960 --> 02:45:24.793
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Olympic glory for Michael Phelps and </v>

3482
02:45:25.991 --> 02:45:29.290
<v Speaker 3>African American woman because there was</v>
<v Speaker 3>like an African American woman who</v>

3483
02:45:29.920 --> 02:45:30.753
<v Speaker 2>street is what I saw is Michael Phelps </v>
<v Speaker 2>when silver is a big headline and then </v>

3484
02:45:35.601 --> 02:45:36.434
<v Speaker 2>below it is world record set and the 800</v>
<v Speaker 2>meters by this woman and he set a world </v>

3485
02:45:41.301 --> 02:45:46.250
<v Speaker 2>record and she was below him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He won a silver and it was above her.</v>

3486
02:45:46.320 --> 02:45:48.180
<v Speaker 3>That must have been another one because </v>
<v Speaker 3>there was,</v>

3487
02:45:48.210 --> 02:45:50.910
<v Speaker 3>there was another one which was </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like a,</v>

3488
02:45:51.320 --> 02:45:52.200
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3489
02:45:52.290 --> 02:45:55.920
<v Speaker 3>Olympic trials for Michael Phelps and </v>
<v Speaker 3>African American athlete.</v>

3490
02:45:56.220 --> 02:45:58.030
<v Speaker 3>Now that's a clumsy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stupid</v>

3491
02:45:58.030 --> 02:45:58.863
<v Speaker 2>headline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3492
02:45:58.870 --> 02:46:00.010
<v Speaker 2>Does that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that the,</v>

3493
02:46:00.011 --> 02:46:01.990
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one Michael,</v>

3494
02:46:02.170 --> 02:46:04.520
<v Speaker 2>as a historic night with </v>
<v Speaker 2>African-american Olympics,</v>

3495
02:46:04.521 --> 02:46:08.050
<v Speaker 2>I said Michael Phelps ratios historic </v>
<v Speaker 2>night with African American.</v>

3496
02:46:08.170 --> 02:46:09.003
<v Speaker 2>Wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>

3497
02:46:09.260 --> 02:46:10.093
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

3498
02:46:10.120 --> 02:46:13.640
<v Speaker 4>he's was widely panned for being </v>
<v Speaker 4>racially insensitive.</v>

3499
02:46:13.740 --> 02:46:15.220
<v Speaker 3>That headline,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the headline,</v>

3500
02:46:15.540 --> 02:46:16.373
<v Speaker 3>Dan Olympics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Michael Phelps shares historic night </v>

3501
02:46:18.241 --> 02:46:19.830
<v Speaker 3>with African American.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>

3502
02:46:20.370 --> 02:46:21.203
<v Speaker 3>my point is it's part of America's anal </v>
<v Speaker 3>obsession with race that makes that </v>

3503
02:46:26.761 --> 02:46:27.594
<v Speaker 3>headline possible in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That headline isn't racist in the way </v>

3504
02:46:30.661 --> 02:46:31.494
<v Speaker 3>that the KKK is racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I mean no white supremacist would </v>

3505
02:46:34.471 --> 02:46:35.304
<v Speaker 3>write that headline,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would just ignore the </v>

3506
02:46:36.181 --> 02:46:40.350
<v Speaker 3>african-american entirely or they would </v>
<v Speaker 3>write off that achievement.</v>

3507
02:46:40.680 --> 02:46:45.000
<v Speaker 3>That is the kind of headline that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>written by a constipated at white guilty</v>

3508
02:46:45.060 --> 02:46:47.700
<v Speaker 3>liberal trying say african-america </v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

3509
02:46:47.701 --> 02:46:49.350
<v Speaker 3>Just say the woman's name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

3510
02:46:49.710 --> 02:46:50.543
<v Speaker 3>Trying to be tokenistic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lee Approving in this kind of a </v>

3511
02:46:52.980 --> 02:46:53.813
<v Speaker 3>paternalistic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>patronizing way that white liberals </v>

3512
02:46:55.531 --> 02:47:00.070
<v Speaker 3>insist on being and in doing so is </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually racist and that's.</v>

3513
02:47:00.180 --> 02:47:01.013
<v Speaker 3>That's telling I think because it is </v>
<v Speaker 3>racist to be overly concerned about </v>

3514
02:47:03.781 --> 02:47:06.150
<v Speaker 3>race.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if you're trying to be positive.</v>

3515
02:47:06.240 --> 02:47:08.280
<v Speaker 3>What does this say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3516
02:47:08.340 --> 02:47:10.290
<v Speaker 3>they put up a second one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 minutes later that.</v>

3517
02:47:10.830 --> 02:47:13.410
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tim says Olympics.</v>

3518
02:47:13.411 --> 02:47:16.920
<v Speaker 4>Michael Phelps shares historic night </v>
<v Speaker 4>with Stanford.</v>

3519
02:47:16.921 --> 02:47:18.070
<v Speaker 4>Simone manual.</v>

3520
02:47:18.100 --> 02:47:21.190
<v Speaker 3>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A gaff says missing something guys.</v>

3521
02:47:21.191 --> 02:47:23.230
<v Speaker 3>The third time was the charm is the Merc</v>
<v Speaker 3>went with,</v>

3522
02:47:24.140 --> 02:47:27.480
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>third time they wrote instead Stanford,</v>

3523
02:47:27.481 --> 02:47:30.170
<v Speaker 4>Simone Manual and Michael Phelps make </v>
<v Speaker 4>history.</v>

3524
02:47:30.320 --> 02:47:33.890
<v Speaker 4>So because Michael Phelps was first,</v>

3525
02:47:34.930 --> 02:47:36.520
<v Speaker 3>that's a layer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's ridiculous.</v>

3526
02:47:36.521 --> 02:47:38.140
<v Speaker 3>So they're saying that when they changed</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

3527
02:47:38.470 --> 02:47:41.200
<v Speaker 3>they didn't put the gold medalist first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They put Michael Phelps</v>

3528
02:47:41.690 --> 02:47:45.090
<v Speaker 4>because he's the best fucking sweater in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the history of the wall ever.</v>

3529
02:47:45.480 --> 02:47:46.313
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what's hilarious is they got it </v>

3530
02:47:47.581 --> 02:47:50.550
<v Speaker 4>right the third time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Her name is first,</v>

3531
02:47:50.760 --> 02:47:52.130
<v Speaker 4>like why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

3532
02:47:52.140 --> 02:47:52.973
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how about just say she won a fucking </v>

3533
02:47:55.350 --> 02:47:56.183
<v Speaker 4>gold medal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why did she have to be in the same </v>

3534
02:47:57.451 --> 02:47:58.620
<v Speaker 4>headline?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is Him Anyway?</v>

3535
02:47:59.100 --> 02:48:02.370
<v Speaker 4>Can you have another goddamn story where</v>
<v Speaker 4>she won a gold medal?</v>

3536
02:48:02.430 --> 02:48:03.263
<v Speaker 4>However,</v>
<v Speaker 4>given her own fucking story and then </v>

3537
02:48:04.801 --> 02:48:06.210
<v Speaker 4>have him have his own story.</v>

3538
02:48:06.900 --> 02:48:08.370
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why not just say Olympics,</v>

3539
02:48:08.440 --> 02:48:09.350
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3540
02:48:09.670 --> 02:48:13.670
<v Speaker 3>golden silver,</v>
<v Speaker 3>silver and gold for Philips and a guy.</v>

3541
02:48:13.850 --> 02:48:16.640
<v Speaker 4>Because if you want people to buy your </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking newspaper,</v>

3542
02:48:16.641 --> 02:48:17.474
<v Speaker 4>you better show Michael Phelps name </v>
<v Speaker 4>because otherwise they're not going to </v>

3543
02:48:19.461 --> 02:48:22.280
<v Speaker 4>buy to see Kim Kardashian of swimming.</v>

3544
02:48:22.770 --> 02:48:23.603
<v Speaker 3>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think there's so much </v>

3545
02:48:24.961 --> 02:48:26.580
<v Speaker 3>unnecessary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3546
02:48:26.581 --> 02:48:27.810
<v Speaker 3>Here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Mercury News,</v>

02:48:27.870 --> 02:48:28.703
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't even have her,</v>

3548
02:48:28.720 --> 02:48:30.300

<v Speaker 3>I didn't have him in the picture.</v>

3549
02:48:30.330 --> 02:48:33.860
<v Speaker 3>Just had a picture of her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well now is that the original?</v>

3550
02:48:34.070 --> 02:48:35.610
<v Speaker 3>The original.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the original.</v>

3551
02:48:36.020 --> 02:48:39.180
<v Speaker 3>Still people love to say his name on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's see.</v>

3552
02:48:39.181 --> 02:48:40.014
<v Speaker 3>Some of these tweets so flustered now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can't even get it grammatically </v>

3553
02:48:43.141 --> 02:48:44.130
<v Speaker 3>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Keep trying.</v>

3554
02:48:44.210 --> 02:48:46.980
<v Speaker 3>Michael historic night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

3555
02:48:47.010 --> 02:48:48.420
<v Speaker 3>Stanford.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3556
02:48:48.421 --> 02:48:49.254
<v Speaker 3>who cares?</v>

3557
02:48:49.310 --> 02:48:50.143
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>social justice warriors care a bunch of </v>

3558
02:48:51.591 --> 02:48:54.500
<v Speaker 4>fucking Weirdo shut ins that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>constantly monitoring the Internet,</v>

3559
02:48:54.740 --> 02:48:58.550
<v Speaker 4>looking to be recreationally offended </v>
<v Speaker 4>and can't wait to look.</v>

3560
02:48:58.640 --> 02:49:00.040
<v Speaker 4>There was a clumsy fucking head,</v>

3561
02:49:01.040 --> 02:49:04.010
<v Speaker 3>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be fair at the reason why this,</v>

3562
02:49:04.090 --> 02:49:04.923
<v Speaker 3>that headline is stupid or exist in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>first place is because it's written by </v>

3563
02:49:08.371 --> 02:49:09.204
<v Speaker 3>someone who has been contaminated by </v>
<v Speaker 3>social justice warrior thinking and </v>

3564
02:49:11.701 --> 02:49:13.590
<v Speaker 3>thinks that they need to point out the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rice,</v>

3565
02:49:14.120 --> 02:49:14.953
<v Speaker 3>the gold medalists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wouldn't it be nice if there was just a </v>

3566
02:49:17.401 --> 02:49:20.760
<v Speaker 3>gold medalist and a silver medalist and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the only metal just happens to be</v>

3567
02:49:20.761 --> 02:49:23.640
<v Speaker 3>much more famous than the gold medalist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So obviously you put his name in.</v>

3568
02:49:23.820 --> 02:49:24.720
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if she</v>

3569
02:49:24.840 --> 02:49:27.500
<v Speaker 2>went to a gas station and lied about </v>
<v Speaker 2>being robbed,</v>

3570
02:49:27.980 --> 02:49:32.510
<v Speaker 2>and then someone from Salon wrote an </v>
<v Speaker 2>article that it's proved that that black</v>

3571
02:49:32.660 --> 02:49:36.080
<v Speaker 2>American women are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have this proof that male athletes are a</v>

3572
02:49:36.081 --> 02:49:38.450
<v Speaker 2>protected class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not proof.</v>

3573
02:49:38.510 --> 02:49:41.420
<v Speaker 2>It's proof that this guy's a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>sociopath.</v>

3574
02:49:41.421 --> 02:49:44.330
<v Speaker 2>And he lied.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mary Elizabeth Williams,</v>

3575
02:49:45.260 --> 02:49:46.093
<v Speaker 2>the ballot of Swim Shady.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good headline because it's </v>

3576
02:49:48.421 --> 02:49:50.840
<v Speaker 2>pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3577
02:49:50.860 --> 02:49:53.110
<v Speaker 2>why that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Male.</v>

3578
02:49:53.130 --> 02:49:54.510
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was wrong too.</v>

3579
02:49:54.511 --> 02:49:55.344
<v Speaker 2>It's like I thought it said white males </v>
<v Speaker 2>just as male athletes are protected </v>

3580
02:49:57.801 --> 02:49:58.634
<v Speaker 2>class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't think that it's fair </v>

3581
02:50:01.340 --> 02:50:04.070
<v Speaker 2>because it was one guy amongst the </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of athletes.</v>

3582
02:50:04.100 --> 02:50:04.933
<v Speaker 2>It's so stupid that you said male </v>
<v Speaker 2>athletes are a protected class because </v>

3583
02:50:07.821 --> 02:50:10.910
<v Speaker 2>he didn't get protected by the way he </v>
<v Speaker 2>got exposed.</v>

3584
02:50:11.150 --> 02:50:13.700
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing protected about dragging</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy's name.</v>

3585
02:50:13.910 --> 02:50:17.930
<v Speaker 2>Do you know he will be the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>subject of jokes about lying for the end</v>

3586
02:50:17.931 --> 02:50:18.450
<v Speaker 2>of time?</v>

3587
02:50:18.450 --> 02:50:19.283
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy will be the benedict arnold of </v>

3588
02:50:21.141 --> 02:50:24.010
<v Speaker 2>jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jenelle did a gag of bed last night.</v>

3589
02:50:24.050 --> 02:50:24.980
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to happen.</v>

3590
02:50:25.010 --> 02:50:25.843
<v Speaker 2>Like there's nothing protected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not proof that he's in a </v>

3591
02:50:28.521 --> 02:50:30.020
<v Speaker 2>protected class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

3592
02:50:30.140 --> 02:50:34.760
<v Speaker 2>it's evidence that no one is protected </v>
<v Speaker 2>from lies because video cameras,</v>

3593
02:50:34.761 --> 02:50:37.640
<v Speaker 2>because of technology and because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>truth eventually gets out.</v>

3594
02:50:37.700 --> 02:50:38.533
<v Speaker 2>I do think that if he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he was a black athlete from a pool </v>

3595
02:50:40.700 --> 02:50:42.590
<v Speaker 2>from like Ghana or something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at that.</v>

3596
02:50:42.591 --> 02:50:45.380
<v Speaker 2>He lost all four major sponsors in one </v>
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

3597
02:50:45.410 --> 02:50:46.280
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a dickhead.</v>

3598
02:50:46.281 --> 02:50:47.114
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a shit about Ryan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lucky who lost a million dollars and </v>

3599
02:50:50.031 --> 02:50:51.740
<v Speaker 2>endorsement money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Woo.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Suck.</v>

3601
02:50:53.050 --> 02:50:56.980
<v Speaker 3>Speaking of breaking ourselves into </v>
<v Speaker 3>intertribal racial camps,</v>

3602
02:50:56.981 --> 02:50:57.814

<v Speaker 2>What does the tweet say?</v>

3627
02:52:00.650 --> 02:52:01.280
<v Speaker 2>Girlfriends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hot.</v>

3628
02:52:01.280 --> 02:52:02.700
<v Speaker 2>Who gives a fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go down.</v>

3629
02:52:02.810 --> 02:52:03.643
<v Speaker 2>School out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stop,</v>

3630
02:52:03.650 --> 02:52:05.390
<v Speaker 2>go back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dammit,</v>

3631
02:52:05.440 --> 02:52:06.070
<v Speaker 2>go back.</v>

3632
02:52:06.070 --> 02:52:07.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying,</v>

3633
02:52:08.460 --> 02:52:09.293
<v Speaker 1>trying to scroll down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a picture of her girlfriend </v>

3634
02:52:11.731 --> 02:52:15.190
<v Speaker 1>right there for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3635
02:52:15.250 --> 02:52:18.700
<v Speaker 1>Is that I should have gone back again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was wrong.</v>

3636
02:52:21.590 --> 02:52:24.880
<v Speaker 1>She looked really cute and so she wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is how I'm running errands from now</v>

3637
02:52:24.881 --> 02:52:27.550
<v Speaker 1>on Hashtag Rio 2016 with the picture of </v>
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>

3638
02:52:28.160 --> 02:52:31.030
<v Speaker 1>But that's not a race joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While people are retarded.</v>

3639
02:52:31.090 --> 02:52:32.260
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a white guy.</v>

3640
02:52:32.420 --> 02:52:33.550
<v Speaker 1>The white guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She'd still.</v>

3641
02:52:33.620 --> 02:52:34.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean she still would have traded it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3642
02:52:34.991 --> 02:52:35.824
<v Speaker 1>So that doesn't mean that she's racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this comes down to the question of </v>

3643
02:52:38.560 --> 02:52:39.393
<v Speaker 1>when we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we accuse someone of doing </v>

3644
02:52:40.301 --> 02:52:42.070
<v Speaker 1>something racist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3645
02:52:42.100 --> 02:52:42.933
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do we actually believe that they're </v>

3646
02:52:44.210 --> 02:52:45.043
<v Speaker 1>racist or are we just trying to find an </v>
<v Speaker 1>excuse to interpret what they're saying </v>

3647
02:52:49.451 --> 02:52:52.810
<v Speaker 1>is basis recreationally outraged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what she is.</v>

3648
02:52:52.811 --> 02:52:54.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where they are,</v>

3649
02:52:54.040 --> 02:52:56.220
<v Speaker 1>where they're getting upset at her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're orange.</v>

3650
02:52:56.770 --> 02:52:59.200
<v Speaker 1>They're deciding that this is something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they should be upset about.</v>

3651
02:52:59.201 --> 02:53:00.970
<v Speaker 1>They see the green light and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>hitting the gas.</v>

3652
02:53:01.030 --> 02:53:03.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you really get pissed off at that?</v>

3653
02:53:03.220 --> 02:53:05.740
<v Speaker 1>Go jump off a fucking bridge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seriously.</v>

3654
02:53:05.770 --> 02:53:07.710
<v Speaker 1>Just stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just stop talking,</v>

3655
02:53:07.720 --> 02:53:08.980
<v Speaker 1>tweeting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interacting,</v>

3656
02:53:08.981 --> 02:53:09.814
<v Speaker 1>stop sharing your opinions of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of sort of emotional and intellectual </v>

3657
02:53:12.791 --> 02:53:13.481
<v Speaker 1>effort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

3658
02:53:13.481 --> 02:53:17.300
<v Speaker 1>that's expended in the world these days </v>
<v Speaker 1>on these outrage outburst.</v>

3659
02:53:17.350 --> 02:53:22.210
<v Speaker 1>If you could channel that hot air into </v>
<v Speaker 1>some kind of power plant,</v>

3660
02:53:22.360 --> 02:53:23.193
<v Speaker 1>be like Zeplin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>light it on fire suppression and just </v>

3661
02:53:24.950 --> 02:53:28.610
<v Speaker 1>grow it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cover album.</v>

3662
02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:31.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a waste of time.</v>

3663
02:53:31.600 --> 02:53:33.390
<v Speaker 1>And it's one of those things where I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think we were.</v>

3664
02:53:33.400 --> 02:53:34.233
<v Speaker 1>We've already beaten it into the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know what it is and I think it's </v>

3665
02:53:37.750 --> 02:53:38.583
<v Speaker 1>slowly being less and less acceptable </v>
<v Speaker 1>for people to do shit like that because </v>

3666
02:53:42.281 --> 02:53:43.114
<v Speaker 1>I think more and more people realize how</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking unproductive and stupid it </v>

3667
02:53:45.521 --> 02:53:46.150
<v Speaker 1>really is.</v>

3668
02:53:46.150 --> 02:53:47.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like that's right.</v>

3669
02:53:47.561 --> 02:53:50.200
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope that the tide is turning,</v>

3670
02:53:50.201 --> 02:53:51.034
<v Speaker 1>but I think that as the tide turns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people who really get a kick out of </v>

3671
02:53:53.501 --> 02:53:54.320
<v Speaker 1>this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3672
02:53:54.320 --> 02:53:58.420
<v Speaker 1>becoming more and more vitriolic and </v>
<v Speaker 1>turning the dial up to 11.</v>

3673
02:53:58.570 --> 02:53:59.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you just feel like they're being</v>

3674
02:53:59.951 --> 02:54:01.570
<v Speaker 1>sidelined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's still shut ins.</v>

3675
02:54:01.600 --> 02:54:03.850
<v Speaker 1>They're still not going out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiencing the world.</v>

3676
02:54:03.851 --> 02:54:04.684
<v Speaker 1>They're still living in this really </v>
<v Speaker 1>bizarre confined environment that they </v>

3677
02:54:09.250 --> 02:54:10.720
<v Speaker 1>exist in or it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3678
02:54:10.800 --> 02:54:12.580
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not reasonable.</v>

3679
02:54:12.990 --> 02:54:14.950
<v Speaker 1>That's not reasonable to get upset at </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3680
02:54:15.010 --> 02:54:15.843
<v Speaker 1>I had a conversation with an African </v>
<v Speaker 1>American friend of mine about braided </v>

3681
02:54:18.071 --> 02:54:18.904
<v Speaker 1>hair the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was it a Kardashian just got her hair </v>

3682
02:54:21.401 --> 02:54:23.590
<v Speaker 1>braided,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural appropriation,</v>

3683
02:54:23.620 --> 02:54:24.453
<v Speaker 1>cultural appropriation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what frustrated me was she kept </v>

3684
02:54:28.090 --> 02:54:32.050
<v Speaker 1>going up to the edge of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of being critical of it and then saying,</v>

3685
02:54:32.200 --> 02:54:33.033
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really carry the way and in </v>

3686
02:54:34.541 --> 02:54:35.950
<v Speaker 1>these conversations I always feel like </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

3687
02:54:35.980 --> 02:54:38.830
<v Speaker 1>well if you don't care then just don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>care.</v>

3688
02:54:39.040 --> 02:54:42.460
<v Speaker 1>Didn't bode Derek do that like way </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking back in the day.</v>

3689
02:54:42.461 --> 02:54:44.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that really cultural?</v>

3690
02:54:44.141 --> 02:54:46.370
<v Speaker 1>Appropriation came from age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ipt.</v>

3691
02:54:46.410 --> 02:54:50.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean they've been around for so much </v>
<v Speaker 1>longer than that.</v>

3692
02:54:50.390 --> 02:54:51.223
<v Speaker 1>Remember when that fucking girl was </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting mad at that boy for having </v>

3693
02:54:53.351 --> 02:54:55.410
<v Speaker 1>dreadlocks and she was trying to cut his</v>
<v Speaker 1>hair off and yeah,</v>

3694
02:54:55.870 --> 02:54:56.703
<v Speaker 1>she's being a cunt to him and she was </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it just because he was a little </v>

3695
02:54:59.321 --> 02:55:00.154
<v Speaker 1>tiny guy and she can get away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if he was a 250 pound football </v>

3696
02:55:02.771 --> 02:55:04.370
<v Speaker 1>player,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she'd be saying the same things to him.</v>

3697
02:55:04.420 --> 02:55:05.920
<v Speaker 1>We'll also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course not he,</v>

3698
02:55:05.960 --> 02:55:06.680
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

3699
02:55:06.680 --> 02:55:07.513
<v Speaker 1>she's at a liberal arts college and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>she knows that he's going to be full of </v>

3700
02:55:10.011 --> 02:55:12.370
<v Speaker 1>enough white guilt that she can pull </v>
<v Speaker 1>that shit and he's,</v>

3701
02:55:13.010 --> 02:55:15.860
<v Speaker 1>he's going to cop it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she assumes and meanwhile she's wrong.</v>

3702
02:55:15.900 --> 02:55:19.040
<v Speaker 1>The dreadlocks came from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Greeks came from the Romans.</v>

3703
02:55:19.040 --> 02:55:19.873
<v Speaker 1>It's like they've been around as long as</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have been stinky with dirty hair </v>

3704
02:55:22.640 --> 02:55:25.970
<v Speaker 1>and so what my friend was saying about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about brides was,</v>

3705
02:55:26.310 --> 02:55:27.920
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go preparation bro.</v>

3706
02:55:27.930 --> 02:55:29.300
<v Speaker 1>Derek Damn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was hot.</v>

3707
02:55:29.930 --> 02:55:32.060
<v Speaker 1>She was hot as fuck back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My friend was saying,</v>

3708
02:55:32.090 --> 02:55:34.080
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all we want is for people to,</v>

3709
02:55:34.120 --> 02:55:36.770
<v Speaker 1>to just recognize that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriation and,</v>

3710
02:55:37.010 --> 02:55:37.920
<v Speaker 1>and to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

3711
02:55:38.120 --> 02:55:38.953
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to understand and to express their </v>

3712
02:55:40.551 --> 02:55:42.710
<v Speaker 1>gratitude for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

3713
02:55:42.711 --> 02:55:45.110
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>By what mechanism would a Kardashian who</v>

3714
02:55:45.111 --> 02:55:48.830
<v Speaker 1>gets brides elicit such a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3715
02:55:49.160 --> 02:55:51.830
<v Speaker 1>exhibit such gratitude for the cultural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if,</v>

3716
02:55:51.860 --> 02:55:54.890
<v Speaker 1>if it gets great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets braids and then goes out and says,</v>

3717
02:55:54.891 --> 02:55:55.724
<v Speaker 1>I want to thank everyone in the African </v>
<v Speaker 1>Community for creating brides that's </v>

3718
02:55:58.071 --> 02:56:00.710
<v Speaker 1>going to cause more of a fucking stood </v>
<v Speaker 1>then if she just did it.</v>

3719
02:56:01.340 --> 02:56:03.860
<v Speaker 1>It's so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if I were a Sarong?</v>

3720
02:56:04.480 --> 02:56:06.680
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't just wear pants and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>black.</v>

3721
02:56:06.950 --> 02:56:10.190
<v Speaker 1>What if you're aware of white European </v>
<v Speaker 1>created pants and shirts?</v>

3722
02:56:10.191 --> 02:56:12.570
<v Speaker 1>Is that cultural appropriation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>

3723
02:56:13.200 --> 02:56:17.210
<v Speaker 1>So stupid culture is about sharing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is about.</v>

3724
02:56:17.211 --> 02:56:19.370
<v Speaker 1>It's about when you go to an Indian </v>
<v Speaker 1>restaurant,</v>

3725
02:56:19.371 --> 02:56:21.590
<v Speaker 1>are you culturally appropriating because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're eating their food.</v>

3726
02:56:21.591 --> 02:56:24.920
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you create your own Indian food,</v>

3727
02:56:25.080 --> 02:56:28.190
<v Speaker 1>are you violating the rules of culture </v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriation?</v>

3728
02:56:28.570 --> 02:56:30.920
<v Speaker 1>If you have taco Tuesday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you a piece of shit,</v>

3729
02:56:31.590 --> 02:56:32.271
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>

3730
02:56:32.271 --> 02:56:34.250
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking dumb man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's dumb.</v>

3731
02:56:34.670 --> 02:56:36.490
<v Speaker 1>You probably paid to sheet if you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>taco Tuesday.</v>

3732
02:56:36.520 --> 02:56:37.850
<v Speaker 1>It's just mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just stupid,</v>

3733
02:56:38.060 --> 02:56:40.250
<v Speaker 1>but some of the best thing about all </v>
<v Speaker 1>this stupid stuff.</v>

3734
02:56:40.251 --> 02:56:41.084
<v Speaker 1>I'm tired of wasting any of my time and </v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts on social justice warrior </v>

3735
02:56:43.731 --> 02:56:44.564
<v Speaker 1>ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually starting to study to stop </v>

3736
02:56:46.071 --> 02:56:46.904
<v Speaker 1>doing that because if people haven't </v>
<v Speaker 1>heard previous times that I've been on </v>

3737
02:56:49.551 --> 02:56:50.384
<v Speaker 1>the show and you like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then go back and listen to the to the </v>

3738
02:56:52.970 --> 02:56:53.803
<v Speaker 1>previous ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you'll find that joe and I spent a </v>

3739
02:56:54.891 --> 02:56:55.724
<v Speaker 1>reasonably large amount of time talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about social justice issues and social </v>

3740
02:56:59.481 --> 02:57:02.050
<v Speaker 1>justice warrior issues and how </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous it all is.</v>

3741
02:57:02.120 --> 02:57:02.953
<v Speaker 1>I feel like to some extent we've reached</v>
<v Speaker 1>a tipping point where that's hopefully </v>

3742
02:57:05.241 --> 02:57:06.074
<v Speaker 1>no longer necessary and now it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit self indulgent for us to be </v>

3743
02:57:09.381 --> 02:57:12.080
<v Speaker 1>whining about the wine is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're right.</v>

3744
02:57:12.081 --> 02:57:14.750
<v Speaker 1>That's how I feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like we've sold one whining,</v>

3745
02:57:15.290 --> 02:57:16.070
<v Speaker 1>I feel like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3746
02:57:16.070 --> 02:57:16.903
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like we've kind of won this </v>

3747
02:57:17.751 --> 02:57:21.590
<v Speaker 1>battle and we don't need to be so </v>
<v Speaker 1>outraged at the outrage anymore.</v>

3748
02:57:21.620 --> 02:57:22.453
<v Speaker 1>I think the data has to come in and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>had to understand that the only reason </v>

3749
02:57:24.531 --> 02:57:25.364
<v Speaker 1>why people were being so recreationally </v>
<v Speaker 1>outraged about the stupid shit because </v>

3750
02:57:27.780 --> 02:57:31.220
<v Speaker 1>they don't have real things to be fucked</v>
<v Speaker 1>up about in real life.</v>

3751
02:57:31.370 --> 02:57:34.040
<v Speaker 1>It's easy to get food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's easy to get shelter.</v>

3752
02:57:34.180 --> 02:57:35.013
<v Speaker 1>It's most people have those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the primary things that we </v>

3753
02:57:37.071 --> 02:57:40.220
<v Speaker 1>need and once you have those things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so readily accessible,</v>

3754
02:57:40.400 --> 02:57:41.233
<v Speaker 1>then you start looking at things to pick</v>
<v Speaker 1>on in the world because you don't have </v>

3755
02:57:43.850 --> 02:57:46.910
<v Speaker 1>any real dilemmas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any real significant,</v>

3756
02:57:46.911 --> 02:57:47.744
<v Speaker 1>important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolute dilemma's primal dilemmas and </v>

3757
02:57:51.401 --> 02:57:52.250
<v Speaker 1>then the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3758
02:57:52.251 --> 02:57:55.390
<v Speaker 1>so the outrage machine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it comes back a little bit to,</v>

3759
02:57:55.450 --> 02:57:57.710
<v Speaker 1>to the reaction to Kurt Metzger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cummins,</v>

3760
02:57:57.910 --> 02:58:01.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm assume is Radha about rape as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what is the appropriate</v>

3761
02:58:01.980 --> 02:58:05.330
<v Speaker 3>parameters of public discourse in order </v>
<v Speaker 3>to trigger the outright?</v>

3762
02:58:05.390 --> 02:58:07.940
<v Speaker 4>See I disagree there because like in </v>
<v Speaker 4>that sense,</v>

3763
02:58:07.941 --> 02:58:12.941
<v Speaker 4>like he's saying something about a </v>
<v Speaker 4>violent crime against women and he's not</v>

3764
02:58:13.041 --> 02:58:14.990
<v Speaker 4>exactly sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3765
02:58:14.991 --> 02:58:15.824
<v Speaker 4>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I kind of see why someone would be </v>

3766
02:58:17.481 --> 02:58:18.314
<v Speaker 4>outraged that you would step up and </v>
<v Speaker 4>defend the guy when you don't really </v>

3767
02:58:21.291 --> 02:58:25.060
<v Speaker 4>know because you weren't there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he's also definitely agree that it's</v>

3768
02:58:25.061 --> 02:58:25.894
<v Speaker 4>a more valid criticism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Criticism of came as a lot more valid </v>

3769
02:58:28.131 --> 02:58:30.380
<v Speaker 4>than criticism of element.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Too Generous for her tweets.</v>

3770
02:58:30.480 --> 02:58:31.490
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Definitely,</v>

3771
02:58:31.670 --> 02:58:32.410
<v Speaker 4>but still</v>

3772
02:58:32.410 --> 02:58:33.243
<v Speaker 3>in both cases I think that getting too </v>
<v Speaker 3>angry and wanting to punish people for </v>

3773
02:58:38.561 --> 02:58:42.820
<v Speaker 3>doing something that's politically </v>
<v Speaker 3>incorrect is not the ideal response like</v>

3774
02:58:42.821 --> 02:58:43.970
<v Speaker 3>did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you see also</v>

3775
02:58:44.300 --> 02:58:45.133
<v Speaker 4>important to point out that he didn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>say that the guy wasn't guilty when he </v>

3776
02:58:48.471 --> 02:58:51.110
<v Speaker 4>did say is that we have to understand </v>
<v Speaker 4>that women are capable.</v>

3777
02:58:51.111 --> 02:58:53.880
<v Speaker 4>He did it in a parody form,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what he did say is women are capable</v>

3778
02:58:53.881 --> 02:58:56.360
<v Speaker 4>of lying to like this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this stupid club,</v>

3779
02:58:56.420 --> 02:58:57.650
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bands.</v>

3780
02:58:57.651 --> 02:58:59.110
<v Speaker 4>This guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3781
02:58:59.170 --> 02:59:01.010
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if they're stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure they're great,</v>

3782
02:59:01.250 --> 02:59:02.083
<v Speaker 4>but they ban this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't know whether or not he's </v>

3783
02:59:03.471 --> 02:59:08.471
<v Speaker 4>guilty and he's saying that this woman </v>
<v Speaker 4>cannot have lied because like my Bible.</v>

3784
02:59:08.780 --> 02:59:09.613
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

3785
02:59:09.760 --> 02:59:10.593
<v Speaker 3>Too Hung up on the question of whether </v>
<v Speaker 3>or not he thinks the guy is guilty or </v>

3786
02:59:12.551 --> 02:59:14.470
<v Speaker 3>not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not his point.</v>

3787
02:59:14.471 --> 02:59:17.320
<v Speaker 3>He's made.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His point is a social.</v>

3788
02:59:17.350 --> 02:59:20.560
<v Speaker 3>Social media should not be the forum in </v>
<v Speaker 3>which we conduct witch hunts</v>

3789
02:59:20.730 --> 02:59:21.421
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

3790
02:59:21.421 --> 02:59:22.211
<v Speaker 4>and so people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they.</v>

3791
02:59:22.211 --> 02:59:23.044
<v Speaker 4>They see something where someone's </v>
<v Speaker 4>stepping out with a controversial </v>

3792
02:59:25.651 --> 02:59:30.651
<v Speaker 4>opinion and what's their immediate idea </v>
<v Speaker 4>is not to debate this and say,</v>

3793
02:59:31.381 --> 02:59:33.750
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is not necessarily appropriate,</v>

3794
02:59:33.751 --> 02:59:35.910
<v Speaker 4>but here's where it's point is and </v>
<v Speaker 4>here's where I disagree.</v>

3795
02:59:35.940 --> 02:59:38.040
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fire him.</v>

3796
02:59:38.100 --> 02:59:40.730
<v Speaker 4>Punish him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bird,</v>

3797
02:59:40.790 --> 02:59:42.440
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

3798
02:59:42.550 --> 02:59:43.383
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

3799
02:59:44.060 --> 02:59:46.200
<v Speaker 3>show it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I ran the Dec.</v>

3800
02:59:46.260 --> 02:59:49.400
<v Speaker 3>Shoot them in the deck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you Say the story about the saatchi,</v>

3801
02:59:49.430 --> 02:59:54.430
<v Speaker 3>the the executive at saatchi in london </v>
<v Speaker 3>who was fired for inappropriate comments</v>

3802
02:59:55.141 --> 02:59:56.700
<v Speaker 3>about feminism?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3803
02:59:56.880 --> 03:00:00.510
<v Speaker 3>so about maybe four or five weeks ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was his comment?</v>

3804
03:00:00.690 --> 03:00:01.523
<v Speaker 3>He said he was getting it as a saatchi </v>
<v Speaker 3>and saatchi and saatchi is one of the </v>

3805
03:00:04.681 --> 03:00:05.514
<v Speaker 3>world's biggest ad agencies and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>based in the uk and he is an elderly </v>

3806
03:00:11.851 --> 03:00:15.720
<v Speaker 3>white guy and he was giving an interview</v>
<v Speaker 3>to business insider and they asked about</v>

3807
03:00:16.230 --> 03:00:21.230
<v Speaker 3>feminism and sexism in the workplace and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said that it's not an issue.</v>

3808
03:00:21.571 --> 03:00:22.404
<v Speaker 3>It's archie because he thinks that women</v>
<v Speaker 3>have this much more expansive vision of </v>

3809
03:00:25.861 --> 03:00:26.694
<v Speaker 3>what their priorities shoulD be and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>old old male dinosaurs have this old </v>

3810
03:00:29.821 --> 03:00:30.654
<v Speaker 3>fashioned idea about success,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is they want to get to the top of </v>

3811
03:00:32.491 --> 03:00:33.324
<v Speaker 3>the ladder and they want to become an </v>
<v Speaker 3>executive and they want to have as much </v>

3812
03:00:35.491 --> 03:00:36.324
<v Speaker 3>money and power as possible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that women have a more expansive </v>

3813
03:00:38.581 --> 03:00:39.414
<v Speaker 3>view and are a wiser and more about </v>
<v Speaker 3>children and family and other things </v>

3814
03:00:45.571 --> 03:00:46.404
<v Speaker 3>than just success.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was perceived as being an </v>

3815
03:00:49.141 --> 03:00:53.100
<v Speaker 3>excuse for not addressing sexism in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>workplace.</v>

3816
03:00:53.130 --> 03:00:55.480
<v Speaker 3>And he was fired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was fired for.</v>

3817
03:00:56.100 --> 03:00:58.890
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's a larry put on,</v>

3818
03:00:59.080 --> 03:01:00.130
<v Speaker 3>on administrative leave</v>

3819
03:01:00.130 --> 03:01:05.050
<v Speaker 1>or whatever it is indefinitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I got an to work in advertising.</v>

3820
03:01:05.590 --> 03:01:06.423
<v Speaker 1>I sort of understood like that is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is a whole big argument and </v>

3821
03:01:09.281 --> 03:01:12.370
<v Speaker 1>interesting conversation that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening among feminists themselves.</v>

3822
03:01:12.371 --> 03:01:13.720
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean even my old boss,</v>

3823
03:01:13.721 --> 03:01:14.554
<v Speaker 1>arianna huffington has written columns </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this sort of thing in between </v>

3824
03:01:17.231 --> 03:01:19.360
<v Speaker 1>Sleeping in between,</v>

3825
03:01:19.570 --> 03:01:24.520
<v Speaker 8>hi wonder have naps.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And dan,</v>

3826
03:01:24.530 --> 03:01:29.530
<v Speaker 8>I complain about how women can make it </v>
<v Speaker 8>as I'm worth $100,000,000,000.</v>

3827
03:01:33.440 --> 03:01:35.020
<v Speaker 1>She's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She sounds like dr.</v>

3828
03:01:35.021 --> 03:01:36.880
<v Speaker 1>Evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dr.</v>

3829
03:01:36.881 --> 03:01:37.714
<v Speaker 1>Evil</v>

3830
03:01:40.630 --> 03:01:45.630
<v Speaker 8>back to me.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You will complete me</v>

3831
03:01:46.910 --> 03:01:47.743
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was not saying that she doesn't say </v>

3832
03:01:48.951 --> 03:01:52.460
<v Speaker 1>that women are being held back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her point is that we need to have like a</v>

3833
03:01:52.461 --> 03:01:55.870
<v Speaker 1>broader view of success rather than just</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about money and power over.</v>

3834
03:01:55.910 --> 03:01:56.930
<v Speaker 1>Sure but big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when a,</v>

3835
03:01:56.931 --> 03:01:58.460
<v Speaker 1>what man says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I look,</v>

3836
03:01:58.461 --> 03:02:02.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that it is appropriate for </v>
<v Speaker 1>a white man at the top of a company that</v>

3837
03:02:02.421 --> 03:02:07.421
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have very many women on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>board to be speculating loudly about why</v>

3838
03:02:07.431 --> 03:02:08.450
<v Speaker 1>it's not important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

3839
03:02:08.451 --> 03:02:11.540
<v Speaker 1>There's no sexism in his company and why</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not important for them to address,</v>

3840
03:02:12.350 --> 03:02:14.270
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think that he should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>fired for it.</v>

3841
03:02:14.510 --> 03:02:15.201
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

3842
03:02:15.201 --> 03:02:17.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you should be able to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>to someone,</v>

3843
03:02:17.630 --> 03:02:18.463
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you feel about racism in your </v>

3844
03:02:19.551 --> 03:02:20.384
<v Speaker 1>company?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you should have to have </v>

3845
03:02:21.681 --> 03:02:22.514
<v Speaker 1>something to accuSe someone of before </v>
<v Speaker 1>you start bringing up accusations like </v>

3846
03:02:25.611 --> 03:02:26.030
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3847
03:02:26.030 --> 03:02:26.863
<v Speaker 1>Like there has to be something like if </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a specific example of sexism </v>

3848
03:02:30.110 --> 03:02:32.530
<v Speaker 1>that he needs to address in his company </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he meets,</v>

3849
03:02:32.550 --> 03:02:34.250
<v Speaker 1>needs to make a statement on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing.</v>

3850
03:02:34.400 --> 03:02:35.233
<v Speaker 1>But how did the journaLists is just into</v>
<v Speaker 1>int interested in this powerful mens </v>

3851
03:02:38.150 --> 03:02:41.030
<v Speaker 1>idea about women in the workforce in </v>
<v Speaker 1>general?</v>

3852
03:02:41.031 --> 03:02:43.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they're making an </v>
<v Speaker 1>accusation if you're right.</v>

3853
03:02:43.310 --> 03:02:44.143
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying they're not making an </v>

3854
03:02:45.330 --> 03:02:47.360
<v Speaker 1>accusation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you're getting upset of this guy's</v>

3855
03:02:47.361 --> 03:02:51.620
<v Speaker 1>opinion about sexism and saying that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't think there's sexism in my company</v>

3856
03:02:51.860 --> 03:02:52.880
<v Speaker 1>because I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is.</v>

3857
03:02:52.890 --> 03:02:55.940
<v Speaker 1>We have this diverse view of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>success is and I think women are getting</v>

3858
03:02:56.120 --> 03:02:58.540
<v Speaker 1>away from this old dinosaur idea of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>second.</v>

3859
03:02:58.550 --> 03:03:00.020
<v Speaker 1>That's just nothing wrong with what he </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

3860
03:03:00.710 --> 03:03:05.030
<v Speaker 1>but if you say anything about sexism </v>
<v Speaker 1>other than what they want you to say,</v>

3861
03:03:05.060 --> 03:03:05.900
<v Speaker 1>well that's the thing.</v>

3862
03:03:05.900 --> 03:03:07.160
<v Speaker 1>What's the problem?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What upsets,</v>

3863
03:03:07.200 --> 03:03:09.890
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I worry about is that people are no</v>

3864
03:03:09.891 --> 03:03:10.724
<v Speaker 1>longer being punished for using bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>woods or slurs or attacking people or </v>

3865
03:03:16.820 --> 03:03:17.653
<v Speaker 1>expressing flagrantly bigoted opinions </v>
<v Speaker 1>or saying that one race or one sex is </v>

3866
03:03:21.561 --> 03:03:24.920
<v Speaker 1>better or worse than another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of cool with taking people down</v>

3867
03:03:24.980 --> 03:03:27.260
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for doing that shit right there.</v>

3868
03:03:27.261 --> 03:03:31.880
<v Speaker 1>Now being punished for simply expressing</v>
<v Speaker 1>opinions that feel old fashioned.</v>

3869
03:03:32.180 --> 03:03:33.013
<v Speaker 1>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you have to subscribe to sort of </v>

3870
03:03:34.760 --> 03:03:36.930
<v Speaker 1>the ideological thought police.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

3871
03:03:37.290 --> 03:03:38.760
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a real worry.</v>

3872
03:03:39.260 --> 03:03:41.420
<v Speaker 1>Even if I disagree with all of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>opinions,</v>

3873
03:03:41.570 --> 03:03:42.403
<v Speaker 1>I want to live in a society that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>boisterous and diverse with lots of </v>

3874
03:03:45.981 --> 03:03:47.380
<v Speaker 1>different argumentative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3875
03:03:47.640 --> 03:03:48.473
<v Speaker 1>arguments coming from lots of different </v>
<v Speaker 1>positions and a lot of my white liberal </v>

3876
03:03:51.201 --> 03:03:54.230
<v Speaker 1>friends disagree with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say that having loose,</v>

3877
03:03:55.910 --> 03:03:57.140
<v Speaker 1>these are smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>successful,</v>

3878
03:03:57.700 --> 03:03:58.533
<v Speaker 1>can lose anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they say is that having someone </v>

3879
03:04:00.981 --> 03:04:04.010
<v Speaker 1>like him expressive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a view like that actually silences other</v>

3880
03:04:04.011 --> 03:04:07.310
<v Speaker 1>people because it deprives it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It probably,</v>

3881
03:04:08.350 --> 03:04:11.660
<v Speaker 1>it probably inhibits the women in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>company from feeling like they can speak</v>

3882
03:04:11.661 --> 03:04:12.494
<v Speaker 1>openly about their ambitions because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they think that there's a misogynistic </v>

3883
03:04:15.201 --> 03:04:18.900
<v Speaker 1>chauvinistic old dinosaur in charge of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the company will biases.</v>

3884
03:04:20.060 --> 03:04:20.893
<v Speaker 4>I can't really comment on this unless I </v>
<v Speaker 4>see his exact quote because we're </v>

3885
03:04:22.970 --> 03:04:24.710
<v Speaker 4>paraphrasing here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm here.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Saatchi and saatchi and saatchi.</v>

03:04:55.600 --> 03:04:58.480
<v Speaker 4>scroll up please.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If women want to equal men,</v>

3898
03:04:58.481 --> 03:05:00.550
<v Speaker 4>they must change their notion of </v>
<v Speaker 4>happiness.</v>

3899
03:05:00.760 --> 03:05:01.593
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Women not men propelled the cult of </v>

3900
03:05:04.511 --> 03:05:05.344
<v Speaker 4>motherhood and spread the frightening </v>
<v Speaker 4>notion that life will never be truly </v>

3901
03:05:09.671 --> 03:05:14.500
<v Speaker 4>complete without a baby and that no </v>
<v Speaker 4>career plotted can compare.</v>

3902
03:05:14.501 --> 03:05:15.334
<v Speaker 4>Is that what he said?</v>

3903
03:05:15.360 --> 03:05:16.350
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not what he said.</v>

3904
03:05:16.351 --> 03:05:17.184
<v Speaker 1>That's an opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pace by someone in the independent who </v>

3905
03:05:19.201 --> 03:05:20.790
<v Speaker 1>is twisting his words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3906
03:05:20.791 --> 03:05:22.720
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is his words?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's find out.</v>

3907
03:05:22.750 --> 03:05:25.210
<v Speaker 1>The margin might be quoted in this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fine.</v>

3908
03:05:25.270 --> 03:05:25.670
<v Speaker 1>His words,</v>

3909
03:05:25.670 --> 03:05:27.520
<v Speaker 4>please.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3910
03:05:27.521 --> 03:05:29.900
<v Speaker 4>it was because of what that is is </v>
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous.</v>

3911
03:05:29.930 --> 03:05:32.300
<v Speaker 4>Would that whatever the fuck that person</v>
<v Speaker 4>just said,</v>

3912
03:05:32.301 --> 03:05:33.320
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can get upset at the guy.</v>

3913
03:05:33.321 --> 03:05:36.980
<v Speaker 4>If he says that their ambition is not a </v>
<v Speaker 4>vertical ambition,</v>

3914
03:05:37.040 --> 03:05:40.400
<v Speaker 4>it is intrinsic circular ambition to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>happy.</v>

3915
03:05:40.880 --> 03:05:42.770
<v Speaker 4>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They are going,</v>

3916
03:05:42.860 --> 03:05:44.780
<v Speaker 4>actually guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're missing the point.</v>

3917
03:05:44.781 --> 03:05:47.060
<v Speaker 4>You don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm way happier than you.</v>

3918
03:05:47.061 --> 03:05:49.820
<v Speaker 4>He explained their ambitious,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not a vertical ambition.</v>

3919
03:05:50.060 --> 03:05:53.060
<v Speaker 4>It is this intrinsic circular ambition </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be happy.</v>

3920
03:05:53.090 --> 03:05:54.830
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is weird.</v>

3921
03:05:55.130 --> 03:05:56.580
<v Speaker 4>Tim hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>abandoned,</v>

3922
03:05:56.581 --> 03:06:00.080
<v Speaker 4>need career here territory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>By saying that saatchi and saatchi,</v>

3923
03:06:00.380 --> 03:06:01.213
<v Speaker 4>he'd met a number of talented women who </v>
<v Speaker 4>reach a certain point in their careers </v>

3924
03:06:04.370 --> 03:06:07.730
<v Speaker 4>and rejected the chance to become </v>
<v Speaker 4>creative directors.</v>

3925
03:06:08.150 --> 03:06:09.290
<v Speaker 4>They're going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually guys,</v>

3926
03:06:09.291 --> 03:06:11.720
<v Speaker 4>you're missing the point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I'll repeat it again.</v>

3927
03:06:11.960 --> 03:06:15.530
<v Speaker 4>He saying that these women are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>guys,</v>

3928
03:06:15.531 --> 03:06:17.270
<v Speaker 4>you're missing the point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't understand.</v>

3929
03:06:17.271 --> 03:06:18.104
<v Speaker 4>I'm way happier than you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He explained their ambition is not a </v>

3930
03:06:19.851 --> 03:06:20.684
<v Speaker 4>vertical ambition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's as intrinsic circular ambition to </v>

3931
03:06:22.911 --> 03:06:23.721
<v Speaker 4>be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3932
03:06:23.721 --> 03:06:24.554
<v Speaker 4>you'd have to debate that idea because I</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't know if that's not necessarily </v>

3933
03:06:28.401 --> 03:06:29.234
<v Speaker 4>true for a lot of women who decided to </v>
<v Speaker 4>have children and then realized they </v>

3934
03:06:31.251 --> 03:06:32.084
<v Speaker 4>would rather raise these children than </v>
<v Speaker 4>climb is stupid fucking corporate </v>

3935
03:06:34.971 --> 03:06:35.804
<v Speaker 4>ladder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think there's anything Wrong </v>

3936
03:06:37.371 --> 03:06:38.204
<v Speaker 4>with what he said.</v>

3937
03:06:39.080 --> 03:06:40.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He also says,</v>

3938
03:06:40.230 --> 03:06:42.080
<v Speaker 1>here's the original article.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

3939
03:06:42.081 --> 03:06:44.690
<v Speaker 1>if you think about those darwinian urges</v>
<v Speaker 1>of wealth,</v>

3940
03:06:44.691 --> 03:06:45.710
<v Speaker 1>power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and fame,</v>

3941
03:06:46.130 --> 03:06:46.963
<v Speaker 1>they're not terribly effective in </v>
<v Speaker 1>today's world for a millennial because </v>

3942
03:06:49.251 --> 03:06:51.260
<v Speaker 1>they want connectivity and </v>
<v Speaker 1>collaboration.</v>

3943
03:06:51.650 --> 03:06:54.020
<v Speaker 1>They feel like they can get that without</v>
<v Speaker 1>managing and leading,</v>

3944
03:06:54.021 --> 03:06:55.830
<v Speaker 1>so maybe we've got the definition wrong.</v>

3945
03:06:56.310 --> 03:06:59.490
<v Speaker 3>We're trying to impose our antiquated </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit on them and they're going,</v>

3946
03:06:59.491 --> 03:06:59.971
<v Speaker 3>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys,</v>

3947
03:06:59.971 --> 03:07:01.140
<v Speaker 3>you're missing the point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't understand.</v>

3948
03:07:01.141 --> 03:07:03.750
<v Speaker 3>I'm way happier than you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their ambition,</v>

3949
03:07:03.751 --> 03:07:05.670
<v Speaker 3>meaning women's ambition is not a </v>
<v Speaker 3>vertical ambition.</v>

3950
03:07:05.671 --> 03:07:07.830
<v Speaker 3>It's this intrinsic circular ambition to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be happy here.</v>

3951
03:07:07.831 --> 03:07:08.664
<v Speaker 3>You just read that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I say we're not judging ourselves by </v>

3952
03:07:10.141 --> 03:07:13.410
<v Speaker 3>those standards that you idiotic </v>
<v Speaker 3>dinosaur like men judge yourself by.</v>

3953
03:07:13.770 --> 03:07:14.603
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think the lack of women in </v>

3954
03:07:15.301 --> 03:07:16.134
<v Speaker 3>leadership roles is a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just not worried about it because </v>

3955
03:07:17.761 --> 03:07:18.594
<v Speaker 3>they're very happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're very successful and doing great </v>

3956
03:07:19.771 --> 03:07:21.960
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't talk about sexual discrimination</v>

3957
03:07:22.080 --> 03:07:24.000
<v Speaker 3>because we've never had that problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank goodness.</v>

3958
03:07:25.850 --> 03:07:28.730
<v Speaker 1>That last part slightly problematic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3959
03:07:28.731 --> 03:07:29.564
<v Speaker 1>I think that what he's doing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>expressing a very self deprecating </v>

3960
03:07:32.451 --> 03:07:35.480
<v Speaker 1>opinion and this is talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself being like an old fart.</v>

3961
03:07:35.620 --> 03:07:39.010
<v Speaker 3>And then the following weekend they </v>
<v Speaker 3>announced that he'd been placed on leave</v>

3962
03:07:39.640 --> 03:07:42.310
<v Speaker 3>and this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they released a statement saying,</v>

3963
03:07:42.420 --> 03:07:44.980
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of his comments,</v>

3964
03:07:45.570 --> 03:07:46.403
<v Speaker 3>it is for the gravity of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>statements that Kevin Roberts has been </v>

3965
03:07:48.551 --> 03:07:51.160
<v Speaker 3>asked to take a leave of absence </v>
<v Speaker 3>effective immediately.</v>

3966
03:07:51.370 --> 03:07:53.200
<v Speaker 3>Oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone can suck my dick.</v>

3967
03:07:53.650 --> 03:07:54.483
<v Speaker 3>Everyone line up promoting gender </v>
<v Speaker 3>equality starts at the top and we will </v>

3968
03:07:58.061 --> 03:07:58.894
<v Speaker 3>not tolerate anyone speaking for our </v>
<v Speaker 3>organization who does not value the </v>

3969
03:08:01.211 --> 03:08:04.360
<v Speaker 3>importance of inclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's what he worked very</v>

3970
03:08:04.361 --> 03:08:05.194
<v Speaker 3>hard to champion diversity and will </v>
<v Speaker 3>continue to insist that each agency's </v>

3971
03:08:07.721 --> 03:08:10.450
<v Speaker 3>leadership be champions of both </v>
<v Speaker 3>diversity and inclusion.</v>

3972
03:08:10.510 --> 03:08:12.790
<v Speaker 3>They should boycott that agency.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're a bunch of twat.</v>

3973
03:08:14.380 --> 03:08:15.213
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe I've spent so many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so many man hours arguing this on </v>

3974
03:08:17.741 --> 03:08:19.000
<v Speaker 3>facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the other thing,</v>

3975
03:08:19.001 --> 03:08:19.834
<v Speaker 3>like when you were talking about using </v>
<v Speaker 3>cell phones and like facebook and like </v>

3976

<v Speaker 3>not using twitter so much and how kind </v>
<v Speaker 3>of corrosive that can be to your lived </v>

3977

3978
03:08:29.561 --> 03:08:32.620
<v Speaker 3>insanity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a fucking waste of time.</v>

3979
03:08:32.621 --> 03:08:34.780
<v Speaker 3>It's a drag on my time these days,</v>

03:08:53.380 --> 03:08:57.570
<v Speaker 1>ended up being like pages and pages and </v>
<v Speaker 1>pages and pages.</v>

3990
03:08:57.571 --> 03:09:01.770
<v Speaker 1>We had to migrate it into medicine job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to go into private messages.</v>

3991
03:09:01.890 --> 03:09:04.790
<v Speaker 1>It's just reams and reams of back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>forth with friends in europe,</v>

3992
03:09:04.791 --> 03:09:07.280
<v Speaker 1>friends all over the world trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>convince me that I'm a,</v>

3993
03:09:07.450 --> 03:09:08.283
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a chauvinist for support on suck my </v>

3994
03:09:10.021 --> 03:09:12.120
<v Speaker 1>dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All those friends follow them.</v>

3995
03:09:13.320 --> 03:09:14.700
<v Speaker 1>People stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They told me,</v>

3996
03:09:14.740 --> 03:09:16.680
<v Speaker 1>they said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the problem.</v>

3997
03:09:16.860 --> 03:09:19.950
<v Speaker 1>This is not a prepared statement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not speaking off the cuff.</v>

3998
03:09:20.010 --> 03:09:20.843
<v Speaker 1>Another point that I was making,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people don't understand what he's </v>

3999
03:09:22.621 --> 03:09:26.340
<v Speaker 1>just having a coffee with a reporter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean what he Said was not that bad.</v>

4000
03:09:26.341 --> 03:09:27.300
<v Speaker 1>He's riffing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4001
03:09:27.301 --> 03:09:28.134
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's trying to speak positively </v>

4002
03:09:29.461 --> 03:09:31.740
<v Speaker 1>about the company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have an issue with sexism.</v>

4003
03:09:31.860 --> 03:09:32.610
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's.</v>

4004
03:09:32.610 --> 03:09:35.040
<v Speaker 1>I disagree with what he's saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's naive.</v>

4005
03:09:35.041 --> 03:09:37.140
<v Speaker 1>I think it's kind of ham fiSted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

4006
03:09:37.141 --> 03:09:37.831
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

4007
03:09:37.831 --> 03:09:38.664
<v Speaker 1>It's not the smartest thing to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not offensive and something that </v>

4008
03:09:41.220 --> 03:09:44.640
<v Speaker 1>usually it's something that certainly </v>
<v Speaker 1>opens up the possibility of debate.</v>

4009
03:09:44.670 --> 03:09:45.660
<v Speaker 1>Like you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4010
03:09:45.800 --> 03:09:47.310
<v Speaker 1>if there's a lot of women that don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel like that,</v>

4011
03:09:47.390 --> 03:09:48.223
<v Speaker 1>I feel like the door or the glaSs </v>
<v Speaker 1>ceiling is there for them to achieve </v>

4012
03:09:50.881 --> 03:09:52.050
<v Speaker 1>management.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

4013
03:09:52.051 --> 03:09:53.980
<v Speaker 1>And the missions and the best</v>

4014
03:09:53.980 --> 03:09:54.813
<v Speaker 3>response to an idea that you disagree </v>
<v Speaker 3>with is to respond with more ideas and </v>

4015
03:09:57.401 --> 03:09:58.234
<v Speaker 3>to take that idea down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not to fire the person who who had that </v>

4016
03:10:00.731 --> 03:10:02.080
<v Speaker 3>idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm so weary,</v>

4017
03:10:02.140 --> 03:10:03.490
<v Speaker 3>I can't do this anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>May two.</v>

4018
03:10:03.491 --> 03:10:05.590
<v Speaker 3>And these are smart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very smart,</v>

4019
03:10:05.591 --> 03:10:06.424
<v Speaker 3>successful people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of them told me that I sounded like </v>

4020
03:10:08.920 --> 03:10:11.170

<v Speaker 3>He basically said that I'm the same.</v>

4021
03:10:11.171 --> 03:10:12.004
<v Speaker 3>He was remembering back to an occasion </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the 19 eighties were an english </v>

<v Speaker 3>but with a whole bunch of adjectives </v>

4029
03:10:31.120 --> 03:10:34.130
<v Speaker 3>I am the type of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just like the type of person who was</v>

4030
03:10:34.370 --> 03:10:35.203
<v Speaker 3>who was opposed to the firing of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>person because he was at every point in </v>

4031
03:10:38.481 --> 03:10:39.314
<v Speaker 3>time our standards evolve and you are </v>
<v Speaker 3>just one of those white chauvinistic </v>

<v Speaker 2>We don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a real issue just to.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Women are accusing a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a real crime.</v>

<v Speaker 3>but insofar as it relates to what should</v>

<v Speaker 3>the penalty be against cut for </v>
<v Speaker 3>expressing an unpopular opinion?</v>
