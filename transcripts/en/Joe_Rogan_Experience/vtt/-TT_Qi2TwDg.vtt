<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience,</v>

2
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.090
<v Speaker 1>like one of the first guys to go for the fucked up laugh,</v>

3
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.900
<v Speaker 1>like in the personal conversation,</v>

4
00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:08.940
<v Speaker 1>like you just sitting there hanging out,</v>

5
00:00:08.941 --> 00:00:09.774
<v Speaker 1>eating lunch,</v>

6
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:10.643
<v Speaker 1>and then you just,</v>

7
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:11.970
<v Speaker 1>you'll go for the,</v>

8
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.280
<v Speaker 1>but you don't mean that you're a really nice guy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

10
00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.930
<v Speaker 1>like I don't think people who aren't either immersed in the world of standup</v>

11
00:00:20.191 --> 00:00:21.840
<v Speaker 1>comedy or know a lot of standup comics,</v>

12
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they appreciate that.</v>

13
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:24.613
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

14
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:25.531
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

15
00:00:25.531 --> 00:00:27.000
<v Speaker 1>I think that to me it's about,</v>

16
00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:27.631
<v Speaker 1>it's a gear.</v>

17
00:00:27.631 --> 00:00:29.880
<v Speaker 1>You're commenting on normal conversation.</v>

18
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:30.181
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

19
00:00:30.181 --> 00:00:30.451
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

20
00:00:30.451 --> 00:00:30.780
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

21
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.620
<v Speaker 1>you're making fun of what a racist would say it and see.</v>

22
00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:35.540
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

23
00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:36.020
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

24
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.860
<v Speaker 1>and you're being racist to also being racist against was we are racist,</v>

25
00:00:40.861 --> 00:00:41.281
<v Speaker 1>are we,</v>

26
00:00:41.281 --> 00:00:42.210
<v Speaker 1>this is what we are.</v>

27
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.870
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

28
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.490
<v Speaker 1>We are judgmental.</v>

29
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:45.960
<v Speaker 1>It's part of evolution.</v>

30
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.750
<v Speaker 1>We're constantly assessing our,</v>

31
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:48.803
<v Speaker 1>our environment.</v>

32
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.380
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes we know the shit you're not supposed to say.</v>

33
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.280
<v Speaker 1>So we say it because it's funny and it's also funny because there's some truth</v>

34
00:00:56.281 --> 00:00:56.670
<v Speaker 1>to it,</v>

35
00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.881
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

36
00:00:56.881 --> 00:00:57.810
<v Speaker 1>And it's fucked up.</v>

37
00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:58.860
<v Speaker 1>There's some truth to it.</v>

38
00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:59.551
<v Speaker 1>And God,</v>

39
00:00:59.551 --> 00:01:00.930
<v Speaker 1>I wish it wasn't true.</v>

40
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.820
<v Speaker 1>I wish stereotypes weren't true.</v>

41
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:03.090
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

42
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.930
<v Speaker 1>We should talions.</v>

43
00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:06.660
<v Speaker 1>I wish my own relatives were an apes.</v>

44
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.270
<v Speaker 1>I really wished they weren't savage,</v>

45
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.280
<v Speaker 1>untrustworthy apes,</v>

46
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:12.990
<v Speaker 1>but they are.</v>

47
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.270
<v Speaker 1>That's what they have to watch.</v>

48
00:01:15.271 --> 00:01:19.530
<v Speaker 1>Fucking real housewives of New Jersey and we've see it's in that Italians.</v>

49
00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:20.670
<v Speaker 1>We see my people,</v>

50
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.920
<v Speaker 1>my people are savages.</v>

51
00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.330
<v Speaker 1>I wish that wasn't true,</v>

52
00:01:24.331 --> 00:01:25.440
<v Speaker 1>but it's fucking true.</v>

53
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.771
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

54
00:01:25.771 --> 00:01:26.401
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to,</v>

55
00:01:26.401 --> 00:01:30.150
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to fight against the Italian stereotype because here's the problem</v>

56
00:01:30.151 --> 00:01:34.620
<v Speaker 1>with Italians that there's many is that you're in Nabard with the fact that</v>

57
00:01:34.621 --> 00:01:35.251
<v Speaker 1>you're Italian.</v>

58
00:01:35.251 --> 00:01:35.421
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

59
00:01:35.421 --> 00:01:36.510
<v Speaker 1>you won't evolve.</v>

60
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.160
<v Speaker 1>Like every Italian guy.</v>

61
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.600
<v Speaker 1>You could meet some guy from fucking the prairie prairie land Midwest,</v>

62
00:01:42.601 --> 00:01:43.590
<v Speaker 1>and if he's Italian,</v>

63
00:01:43.591 --> 00:01:48.480
<v Speaker 1>he'll go and get the pasta fuzzy because they've watched the godfather and</v>

64
00:01:48.481 --> 00:01:52.590
<v Speaker 1>they've watched sopranos and they want to sound like them because they want to</v>

65
00:01:52.591 --> 00:01:53.460
<v Speaker 1>be Italian.</v>

66
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.190
<v Speaker 1>Whereas we're supposed to be all growing away from,</v>

67
00:01:56.191 --> 00:01:57.024
<v Speaker 1>like you're saying,</v>

68
00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.570
<v Speaker 1>the barbaric versions of ourselves should be in the past,</v>

69
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.700
<v Speaker 1>not perpetuated for generations.</v>

70
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.680
<v Speaker 1>I have friends that are back east friends.</v>

71
00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.380
<v Speaker 1>I love him to death and I don't mind when they put it on.</v>

72
00:02:07.381 --> 00:02:08.211
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind when they,</v>

73
00:02:08.211 --> 00:02:08.730
<v Speaker 1>the AA.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm Irish.</v>

80
00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:16.723
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

81
00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:17.401

84
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.973
<v Speaker 1>That's a big one.</v>

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.130
<v Speaker 1>Hey Giuseppe.</v>

86
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.470
<v Speaker 1>Very rare that that my Jewish friends call me Giuseppe if it might be already</v>

87
00:02:28.471 --> 00:02:29.011
<v Speaker 1>when he was high,</v>

88
00:02:29.011 --> 00:02:32.040
<v Speaker 1>but that's never seen an Italian guy have a solo fight.</v>

89
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.680
<v Speaker 1>It's always a fucking group jumps in.</v>

90
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.791
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

91
00:02:35.791 --> 00:02:39.750
<v Speaker 1>there's a herd mentality involved and being proud of what patch of dirt you're</v>

92
00:02:39.751 --> 00:02:40.021
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

93
00:02:40.021 --> 00:02:40.380
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

94
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.150
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't lend itself to courage.</v>

95
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.780
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

96
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:43.440
<v Speaker 1>That's not the,</v>

97
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.790
<v Speaker 1>that's not the right mentality.</v>

98
00:02:44.791 --> 00:02:48.000
<v Speaker 1>That's got the the rugged individual that takes on the group and wins.</v>

99
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.751
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

100
00:02:48.751 --> 00:02:50.490

<v Speaker 1>Like that's it.</v>

149
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.833
<v Speaker 1>I'm good.</v>

150
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:05.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm good.</v>

151
00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.990
<v Speaker 1>Can't date anybody like me fucking animals.</v>

152
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.951
<v Speaker 1>Well that's it too.</v>

153
00:04:08.951 --> 00:04:10.690
<v Speaker 1>You're not supposed to date within your own race.</v>

154
00:04:10.691 --> 00:04:11.411
<v Speaker 1>That's proven.</v>

155
00:04:11.411 --> 00:04:12.244
<v Speaker 1>I married,</v>

156
00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.660
<v Speaker 1>well actually she's half Irish,</v>

157
00:04:13.661 --> 00:04:14.231
<v Speaker 1>half Jewish,</v>

158
00:04:14.231 --> 00:04:15.064
<v Speaker 1>but you got to,</v>

159
00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.690
<v Speaker 1>you got to get a little way from mom.</v>

160
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:18.310
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

161
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.460
<v Speaker 1>well the Irish were the most racist of all people because we're the fairest</v>

162
00:04:21.461 --> 00:04:21.791
<v Speaker 1>skin.</v>

163
00:04:21.791 --> 00:04:22.840
<v Speaker 1>We look down on everybody.</v>

164
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:24.063
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

165
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.250
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck man.</v>

166
00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:29.500
<v Speaker 1>So really we came to America at the time when the Italians came at basically the</v>

167
00:04:29.501 --> 00:04:30.310
<v Speaker 1>same time.</v>

168
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.800
<v Speaker 1>So when you go to the Bronx or Boston,</v>

169
00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:33.960
<v Speaker 1>there's so race week,</v>

170
00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.300
<v Speaker 1>they fucking hate each other and they hate everybody else because we were the</v>

171
00:04:37.301 --> 00:04:38.470
<v Speaker 1>last ones to come over.</v>

172
00:04:38.471 --> 00:04:39.970
<v Speaker 1>So everybody hated us.</v>

173
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.220
<v Speaker 1>We were the last ones to get jobs.</v>

174
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.720
<v Speaker 1>So we have to like the Irish were the last of the mean.</v>

175
00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:45.241
<v Speaker 1>That's why we were,</v>

176
00:04:45.241 --> 00:04:47.560
<v Speaker 1>is that first the first immigrants,</v>

177
00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:48.040
<v Speaker 1>English,</v>

178
00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.730
<v Speaker 1>the Dutch,</v>

179
00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.971
<v Speaker 1>Dutch,</v>

180
00:04:48.971 --> 00:04:49.804
<v Speaker 1>English,</v>

181
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.430
<v Speaker 1>Dutch,</v>

182
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:51.070
<v Speaker 1>English,</v>

183
00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.910
<v Speaker 1>the Scandinavians.</v>

184
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.340
<v Speaker 1>I know so little about the immigration of different cultures in this country.</v>

185
00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:58.840
<v Speaker 1>Always know about my own family,</v>

186
00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:00.180
<v Speaker 1>which was the great depression.</v>

187
00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.260
<v Speaker 1>My grandparents came over during the depression.</v>

188
00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

189
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.640
<v Speaker 1>there's a great book about Cornelius Vanderbilt and it kind of tracks New York</v>

190
00:05:06.641 --> 00:05:07.570
<v Speaker 1>in the 18 hundreds.</v>

191
00:05:07.571 --> 00:05:10.090
<v Speaker 1>And as the waves of people came over and,</v>

192
00:05:10.091 --> 00:05:10.271
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

193
00:05:10.271 --> 00:05:14.980
<v Speaker 1>it's really won the Pulitzer prize called the first tycoon.</v>

194
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:16.030
<v Speaker 1>My Grandmother,</v>

195
00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:16.780
<v Speaker 1>the last tycoon,</v>

196
00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.610
<v Speaker 1>my grandmother grew up in the depression.</v>

197
00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.590
<v Speaker 1>She was kind of insane because of it.</v>

198
00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:23.470
<v Speaker 1>And she used to like hide things all around the house.</v>

199
00:05:23.471 --> 00:05:26.470
<v Speaker 1>Like she hide money in various spots in the house.</v>

200
00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.120
<v Speaker 1>They didn't find it until after she died.</v>

201
00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.811
<v Speaker 1>They went,</v>

202
00:05:28.811 --> 00:05:29.200
<v Speaker 1>Shit,</v>

203
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.770
<v Speaker 1>did she hide?</v>

204
00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.921
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

205
00:05:29.921 --> 00:05:32.380
<v Speaker 1>she had thousands of dollars walls.</v>

206
00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:33.400
<v Speaker 1>But it's just,</v>

207
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.620
<v Speaker 1>but the idea was not just that she had money.</v>

208
00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:36.401
<v Speaker 1>I mean she,</v>

209
00:05:36.401 --> 00:05:37.360
<v Speaker 1>they were very poor.</v>

210
00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

211
00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:42.870
<v Speaker 1>But that she had money that she had squirreled away in to these weird spots all</v>

212
00:05:43.511 --> 00:05:44.380
<v Speaker 1>over their house.</v>

213
00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:45.910
<v Speaker 1>It was really weird.</v>

214
00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.630
<v Speaker 1>I did you almost not find it before you,</v>

215
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:47.831
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

216
00:05:47.831 --> 00:05:49.000
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have anything to do with it.</v>

217
00:05:49.001 --> 00:05:49.451
<v Speaker 1>His,</v>

218
00:05:49.451 --> 00:05:51.370
<v Speaker 1>his children did the,</v>

219
00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:51.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

220
00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:52.590
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

221
00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.910
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

222
00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:54.070
<v Speaker 1>when my grandfather died,</v>

223
00:05:54.071 --> 00:05:56.290
<v Speaker 1>I was over here and I think that's when they,</v>

224
00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:57.650
<v Speaker 1>they started searching the house.</v>

225
00:05:57.651 --> 00:05:59.120
<v Speaker 1>The people that were living in New Jersey,</v>

226
00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.781
<v Speaker 1>they had it.</v>

227
00:05:59.781 --> 00:06:01.940
<v Speaker 1>They had some idea that she was like,</v>

228
00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:02.180
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

229
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.600
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

230
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:02.751
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

231
00:06:02.751 --> 00:06:03.521
<v Speaker 1>they didn't know me.</v>

232
00:06:03.521 --> 00:06:03.721
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

233
00:06:03.721 --> 00:06:04.670
<v Speaker 1>she had this,</v>

234
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:08.630
<v Speaker 1>she had had an aneurysm and she was sick for a long time because of it.</v>

235
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.943
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

236
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:10.551
<v Speaker 1>during that time,</v>

237
00:06:10.551 --> 00:06:12.890
<v Speaker 1>my grandfather took care of her and my grandfather took care of her.</v>

238
00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:14.090
<v Speaker 1>That's when I was staying with him.</v>

239
00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.690
<v Speaker 1>And it was a very fascinating time in my life because,</v>

240
00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:18.500
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

241
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.590
<v Speaker 1>I had left Boston and I had moved to New York,</v>

242
00:06:21.591 --> 00:06:23.660
<v Speaker 1>but I couldn't really afford to live in New York.</v>

243
00:06:23.661 --> 00:06:25.250
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know I had hardly any money.</v>

244
00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:26.900
<v Speaker 1>So I stated my grandfather,</v>

245
00:06:26.901 --> 00:06:28.820
<v Speaker 1>who was living on North Ninth Street,</v>

246
00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.220
<v Speaker 1>which was a really bad neighborhood in Newark,</v>

247
00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:32.301
<v Speaker 1>the next door neighbor,</v>

248
00:06:32.301 --> 00:06:36.650
<v Speaker 1>they got a battering ram broke down his fucking door because he's selling crack.</v>

249
00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.500
<v Speaker 1>And he had like an Audi like next door.</v>

250
00:06:39.501 --> 00:06:40.820
<v Speaker 1>Like this is fucking Newark,</v>

251
00:06:40.821 --> 00:06:41.361
<v Speaker 1>New Jersey.</v>

252
00:06:41.361 --> 00:06:42.470
<v Speaker 1>It's a shitty spot.</v>

253
00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:43.220
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

254
00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.690
<v Speaker 1>And my grandfather was taking care of my grandmother and it was just me and my</v>

255
00:06:47.691 --> 00:06:48.890
<v Speaker 1>grandfather and my grandmother.</v>

256
00:06:48.891 --> 00:06:51.380
<v Speaker 1>It was like one of the lowest points in my life.</v>

257
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:53.300
<v Speaker 1>I had just broken up with my girlfriend.</v>

258
00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:57.080
<v Speaker 1>I had just torn my ACL and I knew that I needed surgery.</v>

259
00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:58.640
<v Speaker 1>I just moved to New York.</v>

260
00:06:58.940 --> 00:06:59.930
<v Speaker 1>I was completely,</v>

261
00:06:59.931 --> 00:07:02.690
<v Speaker 1>totally broke and I was,</v>

262
00:07:02.691 --> 00:07:03.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

263
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:04.340
<v Speaker 1>taking this big risk,</v>

264
00:07:04.341 --> 00:07:05.180
<v Speaker 1>moving to New York.</v>

265
00:07:05.181 --> 00:07:08.150
<v Speaker 1>I'd signed with Sussman and I want to remember that was trying to get my shit</v>

266
00:07:08.151 --> 00:07:08.810
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

267
00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:12.560
<v Speaker 1>And my grandmother like Moans,</v>

268
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:13.461

269
00:07:13.461 --> 00:07:15.830
<v Speaker 1>she's hurt so bad she can't move.</v>

270
00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:17.450
<v Speaker 1>She had an aneurysm 12 years ago,</v>

271
00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:19.080
<v Speaker 1>so she's just lying in bed like that.</v>

272
00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:22.083
<v Speaker 2>Aneurism</v>

273
00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:23.560
<v Speaker 1>just paint all the time.</v>

274
00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:24.430

<v Speaker 1>here's a,</v>

277
00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:27.430

278
00:07:27.431 --> 00:07:28.660
<v Speaker 1>She lived for 12 years.</v>

279
00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:30.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

280
00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.840
<v Speaker 1>And it wasn't a good 12 years.</v>

281
00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:33.130
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't a good 12 years.</v>

282
00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:35.440
<v Speaker 1>It's your grandfather was getting zero action.</v>

283
00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:37.570

284
00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:44.620
<v Speaker 2>This is exactly what I was saying earlier.</v>
