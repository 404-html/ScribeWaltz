00:00:11.251 --> 00:00:13.970
<v Speaker 1>Dave Rubin recommends you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I listened to Dave Room is.</v>

9
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to send a whole lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's recommendations,</v>

10
00:00:15.901 --> 00:00:19.890
<v Speaker 1>but Dave Rubin's one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's been an amazing figure in my life.</v>

11
00:00:19.891 --> 00:00:21.180
<v Speaker 1>Just in the last lesson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even a month.</v>

12
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.193
<v Speaker 1>And he just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's kind of was like my savior when </v>

13
00:00:23.261 --> 00:00:26.040
<v Speaker 1>like everyone was kicking me while I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

14
00:00:26.041 --> 00:00:28.770
<v Speaker 1>He was the one that kind of reached a </v>
<v Speaker 1>handout and so I owe him a great deal.</v>

15
00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:29.683
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should kind of explain what kicking </v>

16
00:00:30.901 --> 00:00:31.734
<v Speaker 1>you while you're down means because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>silly to me than anything because it </v>

17
00:00:34.711 --> 00:00:35.544
<v Speaker 1>doesn't really make sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you tweeted a joke and it's a real </v>

18
00:00:38.761 --> 00:00:39.594
<v Speaker 1>simple joke.</v>

19
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.520
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see if he could pull up the joke.</v>

20
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.283
<v Speaker 1>This is what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Collin tweeted a joke about a day </v>

21
00:00:46.591 --> 00:00:50.280
<v Speaker 1>without a woman and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody knows that a day without what,</v>

22
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.173
<v Speaker 1>without a woman was like that day </v>
<v Speaker 1>without a Mexican thing where you were </v>

23
00:00:53.941 --> 00:00:54.751
<v Speaker 1>supposed to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

24
00:00:54.751 --> 00:00:56.760
<v Speaker 1>imagine if there were no women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

25
00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.710
<v Speaker 1>if there were no women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

26
00:00:58.711 --> 00:01:00.390
<v Speaker 1>there'd be no fucking people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

27
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.370
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women are super important for.</v>

28
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.263
<v Speaker 1>So you just write this tweet joke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a peace and quiet hashtag a day without </v>

29
00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:09.780
<v Speaker 1>a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would laugh.</v>

30
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.990
<v Speaker 1>I would think it was funny and I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>move on and that's it.</v>

31
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.230
<v Speaker 1>So then all the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold on a second,</v>

<v Speaker 1>go above that.</v>

35
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.640
<v Speaker 1>Above it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll get that.</v>

36
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.890
<v Speaker 1>Sent this tweet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was roundly condemned as sexist.</v>

37
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:27.383
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not really true if you leave the gaming </v>

38
00:01:28.801 --> 00:01:29.634
<v Speaker 1>industry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a rapidly condemned in the gaming </v>

39
00:01:32.101 --> 00:01:32.940
<v Speaker 1>industry for sure.</v>

40
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.370
<v Speaker 1>Outside of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people I think normal everyday,</v>

41
00:01:35.371 --> 00:01:38.940
<v Speaker 1>people that don't have an ax to grind </v>
<v Speaker 1>about literally everything found it,</v>

42
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.893
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reddit maybe growing or maybe laughed </v>

43
00:01:40.951 --> 00:01:42.990
<v Speaker 1>and then kept going about their day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a normal person.</v>

44
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.210
<v Speaker 1>You're not allowed to have any </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality anymore.</v>

45
00:01:45.211 --> 00:01:46.044
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you work for any kind of accompany </v>

46
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.170
<v Speaker 1>that is in any way public where you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>be targeted,</v>

47
00:01:52.171 --> 00:01:53.010
<v Speaker 1>where they can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

48
00:01:53.011 --> 00:01:54.630
<v Speaker 1>that's the fucking God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go get them.</v>

49
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.570
<v Speaker 1>Like anything that's remotely </v>
<v Speaker 1>controversial.</v>

50
00:01:57.571 --> 00:01:59.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean that is a really remotely </v>
<v Speaker 1>controversial.</v>

51
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.510
<v Speaker 1>It's just Al Bundy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

52
00:02:01.511 --> 00:02:03.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not even a good joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

53
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.260
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

54
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.870
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

55
00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.510
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard you and Jim Norton talking about</v>

56
00:02:06.511 --> 00:02:08.610
<v Speaker 1>it by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that video that someone clipped that out</v>

57
00:02:08.611 --> 00:02:10.770
<v Speaker 1>and put it up on some youtube channel </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like a,</v>

58
00:02:10.771 --> 00:02:13.490
<v Speaker 1>that's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that video is going to be irrelevant.</v>

59
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.730
<v Speaker 1>My family forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone was like,</v>

60
00:02:14.731 --> 00:02:16.050
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is going on?</v>

61
00:02:16.051 --> 00:02:19.470
<v Speaker 1>This is so great so far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do appreciate you stepping up.</v>

62
00:02:19.471 --> 00:02:21.450
<v Speaker 1>And when I got your DM,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way on twitter,</v>

63
00:02:21.451 --> 00:02:22.284
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what an amazing turn of events </v>

64
00:02:23.821 --> 00:02:24.750
<v Speaker 1>this has been for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

65
00:02:24.751 --> 00:02:26.160
<v Speaker 1>I really am appreciative of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

66
00:02:26.161 --> 00:02:27.530
<v Speaker 1>I want you to know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

67
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.540
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop saying it makes me uncomfortable.</v>

68
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.860
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

69
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.620
<v Speaker 1>at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

70
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:34.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

71
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.053
<v Speaker 1>I was in bed with my girlfriend actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I wrote it and I showed it to her </v>

72
00:02:37.381 --> 00:02:38.610
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is kind of funny,</v>

73
00:02:38.611 --> 00:02:39.444
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of stupid.</v>

74
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:40.613
<v Speaker 1>And she laughed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

75
00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:41.453
<v Speaker 1>she's an er nurse and she works the </v>
<v Speaker 1>overnight shift so she was just getting </v>

76
00:02:43.381 --> 00:02:45.780
<v Speaker 1>into bed as I was getting up and she's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

77
00:02:45.781 --> 00:02:46.231
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was funny.</v>

78
00:02:46.231 --> 00:02:47.850
<v Speaker 1>Then we didn't really think twice about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

79
00:02:47.851 --> 00:02:49.080
<v Speaker 1>I sent it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got in the shower,</v>

80
00:02:49.081 --> 00:02:49.914
<v Speaker 1>I went about my day and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then when I got to work I realized </v>

81
00:02:52.351 --> 00:02:55.890
<v Speaker 1>that it was a much bigger deal than I </v>
<v Speaker 1>had thought and it was,</v>

82
00:02:55.891 --> 00:02:58.830
<v Speaker 1>and then everything fell apart and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was rebuilt very quickly.</v>

83
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well</v>

84
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.470
<v Speaker 2>you resigned from the company that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>worked for?</v>

85
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.333
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found that I founded the company I </v>

86
00:03:04.421 --> 00:03:06.130
<v Speaker 2>owned a piece of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you resigned because of that?</v>

87
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:07.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

88
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.640
<v Speaker 2>Other reasons too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean that was definitely the straw</v>

89
00:03:09.641 --> 00:03:11.980
<v Speaker 2>that broke the camel's back for me yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What in the fuck,</v>

90
00:03:11.981 --> 00:03:12.910
<v Speaker 2>man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

91
00:03:12.911 --> 00:03:13.960
<v Speaker 2>it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt like,</v>

92
00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:15.803
<v Speaker 2>how is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how is it possible that in this day and </v>

93
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.600
<v Speaker 2>age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that simple tweet,</v>

94
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.420
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you reverse the sexes in that tweet,</v>

95
00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.570
<v Speaker 2>there's not a single man that would </v>
<v Speaker 2>complain and if he did,</v>

96
00:03:25.571 --> 00:03:26.800
<v Speaker 2>he's not a man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

97
00:03:26.801 --> 00:03:27.634
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I say also that if a person that </v>

98
00:03:29.111 --> 00:03:29.944
<v Speaker 2>wasn't a self described like moderate </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative or libertarian sent that </v>

99
00:03:32.531 --> 00:03:33.364
<v Speaker 2>joke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it also wouldn't have gotten the </v>

100
00:03:35.141 --> 00:03:36.280
<v Speaker 2>firestorm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing Joe,</v>

101
00:03:36.281 --> 00:03:37.114
<v Speaker 2>is that you don't think a liberal man </v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't have gotten a rash of shit and </v>

102
00:03:40.241 --> 00:03:41.074
<v Speaker 2>been sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think out of the community maybe in a </v>

103
00:03:44.201 --> 00:03:46.540
<v Speaker 2>different maybe in a different place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not in the gaming industry,</v>

104
00:03:46.541 --> 00:03:49.150
<v Speaker 2>which is almost completely hyper </v>
<v Speaker 2>liberal.</v>

105
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.013
<v Speaker 2>So I've had a target on my back for </v>
<v Speaker 2>years and that's I think kind of the </v>

106
00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:56.230
<v Speaker 2>point that's lost on some people is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was just an opportunity.</v>

107
00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.410
<v Speaker 2>No one was offended by this joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one was a gas,</v>

108
00:03:59.411 --> 00:04:00.244
<v Speaker 2>like I said on Rubin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the second time I was on there I </v>

109
00:04:01.211 --> 00:04:03.180
<v Speaker 2>said like no one was crying in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>shower,</v>

110
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.050
<v Speaker 2>losing sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tossing and turning over.</v>

111
00:04:05.051 --> 00:04:06.310
<v Speaker 2>They had shown was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

112
00:04:06.311 --> 00:04:07.144
<v Speaker 2>I hope so because that's what we should </v>
<v Speaker 2>find that person and that person is </v>

113
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.370
<v Speaker 2>studied them in a lab.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But to me I was like,</v>

114
00:04:12.371 --> 00:04:12.731
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is.</v>

115
00:04:12.731 --> 00:04:13.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

116
00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:14.043
<v Speaker 2>it was clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A few hours later when I finally </v>

117
00:04:14.831 --> 00:04:15.820
<v Speaker 2>realized what was happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

118
00:04:15.821 --> 00:04:17.230
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're in for the kill now.</v>

119
00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.980
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is.</v>

120
00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:18.813
<v Speaker 2>They found their way to get me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so why do you think they wanted to </v>

121
00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.420
<v Speaker 2>quote unquote get you?</v>

122
00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:23.980
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>

123
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I live in San Francisco.</v>

124
00:04:25.061 --> 00:04:27.280
<v Speaker 2>I've lived there for 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was born and raised on long island,</v>

125
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.660
<v Speaker 2>but I went to college in Boston and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>I moved to San Francisco and um,</v>

126
00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.300
<v Speaker 2>it is as cartoonishly liberal as </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone thinks it is.</v>

127
00:04:34.301 --> 00:04:35.470
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

128
00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.230
<v Speaker 2>and the gaming industry is there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gaming media,</v>

129
00:04:38.231 --> 00:04:40.750
<v Speaker 2>the people that write about games and </v>
<v Speaker 2>cover them and do all that kind of stuff</v>

130
00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:41.613
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're largely there and it's a huge </v>

131
00:04:42.971 --> 00:04:43.804
<v Speaker 2>echo chamber.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't like when people penetrate </v>

132
00:04:45.281 --> 00:04:48.220
<v Speaker 2>the Echo Chamber and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I made a name for myself in the industry</v>

133
00:04:48.221 --> 00:04:49.054
<v Speaker 2>over years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was the senior editor of the biggest </v>

134
00:04:50.021 --> 00:04:52.930
<v Speaker 2>gaming website in the world for years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but websites,</v>

135
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.000
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] dot com.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

136
00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.900
<v Speaker 2>and I was the senior editor there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

137
00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.113
<v Speaker 2>I made a name for myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only with criticism and with long </v>

138
00:04:59.771 --> 00:05:00.610
<v Speaker 2>form pieces but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

139
00:05:00.611 --> 00:05:01.444
<v Speaker 2>but basically I was writing pieces about</v>
<v Speaker 2>political correctness in 2011 and 2012 </v>

140
00:05:05.051 --> 00:05:06.310
<v Speaker 2>people going after game developers.</v>

141
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.620
<v Speaker 2>People going after all these things and </v>
<v Speaker 2>me kind of standing up and saying,</v>

142
00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.650
<v Speaker 2>this isn't okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This character assassination.</v>

143
00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.500
<v Speaker 2>A good example for everyone out there </v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't know games.</v>

144
00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:16.480
<v Speaker 2>There's this game called borderlands </v>
<v Speaker 2>two.</v>

145
00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.170
<v Speaker 2>One of the developers was giving an </v>
<v Speaker 2>interview about it.</v>

146
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.610
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

147
00:05:21.611 --> 00:05:22.444
<v Speaker 2>and this was back in I think 2011.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said something to the nature of this </v>

148
00:05:25.121 --> 00:05:25.954
<v Speaker 2>mode.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This particular mode in the game is </v>

149
00:05:27.011 --> 00:05:27.844
<v Speaker 2>accessible for everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a girlfriend mode if you want </v>

150
00:05:29.111 --> 00:05:31.330
<v Speaker 2>your girlfriend to come play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was like a.</v>

151
00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:32.740
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>girl,</v>

152
00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:33.693
<v Speaker 2>he insinuated that women can't play </v>
<v Speaker 2>games and don't know how to play games </v>

153
00:05:35.181 --> 00:05:36.014
<v Speaker 2>where everybody using the term </v>
<v Speaker 2>girlfriend when people went after this </v>

154
00:05:37.211 --> 00:05:38.590
<v Speaker 2>guy and tried to get them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

155
00:05:38.591 --> 00:05:39.940
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wrote this piece saying like,</v>

156
00:05:39.941 --> 00:05:40.774
<v Speaker 2>what the Hell is everyone doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy just is trying to explain </v>

157
00:05:42.761 --> 00:05:43.960
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not as sexist.</v>

158
00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.943
<v Speaker 2>Why do you make these assumptions based </v>
<v Speaker 2>on this one thing about him and why do </v>

159
00:05:46.511 --> 00:05:48.700
<v Speaker 2>you want to ruin someone?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the whole thing.</v>

160
00:05:48.701 --> 00:05:49.534
<v Speaker 2>They want to ruin people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was outspoken about this and I was </v>

161
00:05:51.731 --> 00:05:52.564
<v Speaker 2>outspoken for my supportive Mitt Romney </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was outspoken about my sport for </v>

162
00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.100
<v Speaker 2>Gary Johnson and my house book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they don't like that.</v>

163
00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.300
<v Speaker 1>They don't like that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

164
00:05:59.301 --> 00:05:59.961
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

165
00:05:59.961 --> 00:06:01.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's pretty clear now.</v>

166
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.950
<v Speaker 1>So you feel like there's a sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>reinforced type of thinking,</v>

167
00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:08.023
<v Speaker 1>like a very liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reinforced type of thinking that you </v>

168
00:06:10.611 --> 00:06:12.770
<v Speaker 1>must subscribe to if you want to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of this?</v>

169
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:13.880
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an orthodoxy.</v>

170
00:06:13.881 --> 00:06:15.850
<v Speaker 1>It's a complete and utter orthodoxy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

171
00:06:15.851 --> 00:06:18.050
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's what's so nice about this,</v>

172
00:06:18.051 --> 00:06:18.884
<v Speaker 1>like the unintended consequence that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think is the silver lining of the dark </v>

173
00:06:20.811 --> 00:06:24.650
<v Speaker 1>cloud is people from the outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now Saul firsthand,</v>

174
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:26.960
<v Speaker 1>like what I had been saying for a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

175
00:06:26.961 --> 00:06:27.794
<v Speaker 1>which was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was like I was kind of on the </v>

176
00:06:28.491 --> 00:06:31.310
<v Speaker 1>fringe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was kind of being pushed out and I got</v>

177
00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:32.780
<v Speaker 1>out literally thousands of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>tweeting.</v>

178
00:06:32.781 --> 00:06:34.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean facebook message me and doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything being like,</v>

179
00:06:34.641 --> 00:06:35.810
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is fucking crazy.</v>

180
00:06:35.811 --> 00:06:37.370
<v Speaker 1>These people really are out to get you.</v>

181
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:38.980
<v Speaker 1>Based on that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

182
00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.010
<v Speaker 1>you would think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

183
00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:41.750
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said some horrible,</v>

184
00:06:41.751 --> 00:06:44.120
<v Speaker 1>just offensive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just truly awful thing.</v>

185
00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.090
<v Speaker 1>Do you think they're really out to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>you or do you think they're capitalizing</v>

186
00:06:47.091 --> 00:06:47.924
<v Speaker 1>on a moment where they feel like you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a target on you and they'll like </v>

187
00:06:50.301 --> 00:06:51.230
<v Speaker 1>kick him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's down.</v>

188
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:52.183
<v Speaker 1>We got them and some days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this reaction culture that we have </v>

189
00:06:55.671 --> 00:06:59.210
<v Speaker 1>like this over overreaction culture that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we find ourself in today,</v>

190
00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:00.463
<v Speaker 1>it really does seem to foster that kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of behavior that people really like it </v>

191
00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:06.703
<v Speaker 1>when someone gets caught doing something</v>
<v Speaker 1>or when someone says something </v>

192
00:07:09.171 --> 00:07:10.004
<v Speaker 1>inappropriate when you could just point </v>
<v Speaker 1>the finger and then everybody can pile </v>

193
00:07:12.231 --> 00:07:13.100
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

194
00:07:13.101 --> 00:07:13.934
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well let me put it a different way </v>

195
00:07:14.271 --> 00:07:17.660
<v Speaker 1>because I think you're probably right in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sense in the sense that I.</v>

196
00:07:17.661 --> 00:07:19.940
<v Speaker 1>I never gained the benefit of the doubt </v>
<v Speaker 1>with this group.</v>

197
00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:20.750
<v Speaker 1>Let's put it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

198
00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:22.040
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was one thing.</v>

199
00:07:22.041 --> 00:07:22.874
<v Speaker 1>It was just the one thing that dominoes </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was tipped and it was in that and </v>

200
00:07:24.681 --> 00:07:25.514
<v Speaker 1>they were down as opposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I brought up the example </v>

201
00:07:26.691 --> 00:07:27.524
<v Speaker 1>before of if one of the people that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually liked within that insular </v>

202
00:07:29.631 --> 00:07:30.464
<v Speaker 1>industry said the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might have been a gas but they may </v>

203
00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:35.390
<v Speaker 1>might have reached a handout or given </v>
<v Speaker 1>that person a second chance.</v>

204
00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:38.060
<v Speaker 1>So I think that that all plays into the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

205
00:07:38.061 --> 00:07:39.710
<v Speaker 1>I have it the Gadsden flag as my </v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter,</v>

206
00:07:39.711 --> 00:07:41.510
<v Speaker 1>I kind of had that first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since 2009.</v>

207
00:07:41.511 --> 00:07:42.600
<v Speaker 1>I am,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

208
00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:45.890
<v Speaker 1>I've not been shots and flag being don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>tread on one of the snake.</v>

209
00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:46.813
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

210
00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:48.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

211
00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:49.333
<v Speaker 1>so there are just certain things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>may be very different than other people </v>

212
00:07:52.251 --> 00:07:54.080
<v Speaker 1>in the industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that I definitely think that</v>

213
00:07:54.081 --> 00:07:54.440
<v Speaker 1>that plays a.</v>

214
00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:55.273
<v Speaker 1>what's your twitter name is no taxation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a reference to the American </v>

215
00:07:57.531 --> 00:07:58.670
<v Speaker 1>revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I know,</v>

216
00:07:58.671 --> 00:07:59.481
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people think,</v>

217
00:07:59.481 --> 00:08:00.200
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

218
00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:00.981
<v Speaker 1>no taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

219
00:08:00.981 --> 00:08:02.000
<v Speaker 1>that's not what it means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

220
00:08:02.001 --> 00:08:04.430
<v Speaker 1>I can't fit no taxation without </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation on twitter.</v>

221
00:08:04.431 --> 00:08:05.570
<v Speaker 1>That's why it doesn't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

222
00:08:05.571 --> 00:08:06.890
<v Speaker 1>that would be a long ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

223
00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.990
<v Speaker 1>Unnecessarily long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd have no room for tweets,</v>

224
00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.060
<v Speaker 1>but it would make you very economical </v>
<v Speaker 1>with your words.</v>

225
00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:13.940
<v Speaker 1>That's what I love about twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You probably feel the same way.</v>

226
00:08:13.941 --> 00:08:14.774
<v Speaker 1>I write something really long sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I have to Parse it and figure out </v>

227
00:08:17.481 --> 00:08:18.314
<v Speaker 1>how to make it fit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it feels so very good for joke </v>

228
00:08:19.371 --> 00:08:20.500
<v Speaker 1>writing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like for,</v>

229
00:08:20.501 --> 00:08:23.750
<v Speaker 1>for the skill of joke writing to make to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make things more concise.</v>

230
00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:26.810
<v Speaker 1>Like I always tell people that I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>the greatest joke writer or the greatest</v>

231
00:08:26.811 --> 00:08:31.430
<v Speaker 1>comedian is Joey Diaz because he says he</v>
<v Speaker 1>gives you the most amount of visuals and</v>

232
00:08:31.431 --> 00:08:32.990
<v Speaker 1>impact with the least amount of words.</v>

233
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:34.063
<v Speaker 1>It's just ba Ba ba Ba ba Ba ba.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knows how to like sink it in really </v>

234
00:08:36.801 --> 00:08:39.530
<v Speaker 1>quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And twitter's like a good tool for that.</v>

235
00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:43.370
<v Speaker 1>But not if that's a little ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's because you only back.</v>

236
00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:45.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's the case how it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is now,</v>

237
00:08:45.201 --> 00:08:47.540
<v Speaker 1>but we'll actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It definitely is.</v>

238
00:08:47.541 --> 00:08:49.370
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if I write to you,</v>

239
00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:51.133
<v Speaker 1>if I reply to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your name takes up a big chunk of what </v>

240
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:58.380
<v Speaker 1>tweet for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what you tweet doesn't take up.</v>

241
00:08:58.410 --> 00:08:59.243
<v Speaker 1>So it's like the 140 characters would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>limiting people that respond to you </v>

242
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:05.940
<v Speaker 1>rather than you tweeting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

243
00:09:05.941 --> 00:09:07.500
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the beauty is to,</v>

244
00:09:07.501 --> 00:09:08.334
<v Speaker 1>as you've probably noticed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that I think in the last year or </v>

245
00:09:09.081 --> 00:09:09.914
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they images you have to take up </v>

246
00:09:10.801 --> 00:09:14.700
<v Speaker 1>characters too and the videos and links </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think the links are the only thing</v>

247
00:09:14.701 --> 00:09:16.710
<v Speaker 1>left that takes up the extra characters </v>
<v Speaker 1>in addition to the name,</v>

248
00:09:16.711 --> 00:09:17.700
<v Speaker 1>but it keeps everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kurt.</v>

249
00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:18.803
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't stop people from </v>
<v Speaker 1>tweeting 7,000 times in a row and put </v>

250
00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:22.260
<v Speaker 1>numbers on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done it too.</v>

251
00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:23.143
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I did it just yesterday when I </v>

252
00:09:23.971 --> 00:09:27.030
<v Speaker 1>ran into some woman in San Francisco </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I was walking my dog.</v>

253
00:09:27.031 --> 00:09:29.190
<v Speaker 1>I have a Boston terrier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was like a little sicker.</v>

254
00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:31.850
<v Speaker 1>Her poop was a little wet so I went and </v>
<v Speaker 1>picked it up and I left like,</v>

255
00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:33.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like smear,</v>

256
00:09:33.061 --> 00:09:34.920
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to use your fingernails to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get off the ground.</v>

257
00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:38.280
<v Speaker 1>So the woman came out of her apartment </v>
<v Speaker 1>and started scolding me.</v>

258
00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:41.550
<v Speaker 1>Like she was waiting by the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the window to scold me for this.</v>

259
00:09:41.551 --> 00:09:43.290
<v Speaker 1>And I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the Hell is going on?</v>

260
00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:45.200
<v Speaker 1>So I had to tweet out a few tweets about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that just for it.</v>

261
00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:47.460
<v Speaker 1>For posterity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

262
00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:51.150
<v Speaker 1>to the twitter thing is very weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here's something that I really don't</v>

263
00:09:51.151 --> 00:09:53.400
<v Speaker 1>like and I'm glad I don't see much of it</v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

264
00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:54.960
<v Speaker 1>Is that twit longer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

265
00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:57.830
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a loophole.</v>

266
00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:00.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't do that.</v>

267
00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:03.390
<v Speaker 1>Don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ralphie may's do that shit all the time.</v>

268
00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:04.590
<v Speaker 1>He used to read his tweets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

269
00:10:04.591 --> 00:10:05.640
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ralphie,</v>

270
00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:08.070
<v Speaker 1>while you're writing paragraphs here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what's going on?</v>

271
00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:09.031
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people,</v>

272
00:10:09.031 --> 00:10:11.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done it to a put.</v>

273
00:10:11.091 --> 00:10:14.880
<v Speaker 1>We'll like go in in photoshop and make a</v>
<v Speaker 1>paragraph of text and then make that the</v>

274
00:10:14.881 --> 00:10:16.660
<v Speaker 1>image that you will do that on instagram</v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

275
00:10:16.661 --> 00:10:17.970
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done that before.</v>

276
00:10:17.971 --> 00:10:20.430
<v Speaker 1>I've drawn written things down and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking a photo.</v>

277
00:10:20.431 --> 00:10:21.600
<v Speaker 1>I said I was going to do that for </v>
<v Speaker 1>awhile.</v>

278
00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:23.730
<v Speaker 1>That I think that twitter is just too </v>
<v Speaker 1>impersonal.</v>

279
00:10:23.731 --> 00:10:25.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to write all my stuff out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then take a picture of it,</v>

280
00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:28.760
<v Speaker 1>but I was just fucking around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if that's the exception,</v>

281
00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:30.510
<v Speaker 1>the exception,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's totally fine.</v>

282
00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:32.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't want people to ruin in twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like the Curtis.</v>

283
00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:34.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's good.</v>

284
00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:35.130
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good format,</v>

285
00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:38.490
<v Speaker 1>but it also makes it extremely easy for </v>
<v Speaker 1>people to do what happened to you.</v>

286
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:39.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

287
00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:40.860
<v Speaker 1>Because there are nuances lost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

288
00:10:40.861 --> 00:10:42.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wants his last.</v>

289
00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:44.040
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always lost in text.</v>

290
00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:46.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're in writing.</v>

291
00:10:46.411 --> 00:10:48.750
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you're reading a book,</v>

292
00:10:48.751 --> 00:10:51.550
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you have to go over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>previous paragraphs.</v>

293
00:10:51.551 --> 00:10:53.910
<v Speaker 1>We'll figure out exactly how this guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>was setting this up,</v>

294
00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.040
<v Speaker 1>but I think what's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's happening,</v>

295
00:10:56.190 --> 00:11:00.860
<v Speaker 1>what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see there's two parts of one.</v>

296
00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:04.950
<v Speaker 1>The example you gave before about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy saying that like girlfriend mode,</v>

297
00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:08.460
<v Speaker 1>if he just said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like say if your girlfriend doesn't</v>

298
00:11:08.461 --> 00:11:11.340
<v Speaker 1>play video games and she wants to really</v>
<v Speaker 1>easily accessible,</v>

299
00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:12.900
<v Speaker 1>you could do it that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'd be.</v>

300
00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.610
<v Speaker 1>People probably would attack them even </v>
<v Speaker 1>for that.</v>

301
00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:15.883
<v Speaker 1>It would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you implying that girls don't </v>

302
00:11:17.071 --> 00:11:18.240
<v Speaker 1>play video games?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

303
00:11:18.241 --> 00:11:19.920
<v Speaker 1>that's the impulse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always the implication,</v>

304
00:11:19.921 --> 00:11:22.020
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like everyone's always out to assume the</v>

305
00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:22.883
<v Speaker 1>absolute worst announced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're always trying to write about like </v>

306
00:11:24.661 --> 00:11:27.120
<v Speaker 1>this guy is just trying to make an </v>
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>

307
00:11:27.121 --> 00:11:29.220
<v Speaker 1>He's probably given 15 pr interviews </v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

308
00:11:29.221 --> 00:11:30.054
<v Speaker 1>He's probably exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is also a developer so he doesn't </v>

309
00:11:31.531 --> 00:11:32.364
<v Speaker 1>have much PR training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to just get the point </v>

310
00:11:34.051 --> 00:11:34.884
<v Speaker 1>across.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you have to assume the man is a </v>

311
00:11:36.301 --> 00:11:38.340
<v Speaker 1>sexist and a messages because of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing.</v>

312
00:11:38.341 --> 00:11:38.691
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

313
00:11:38.691 --> 00:11:39.524
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm willing to die on that hill because </v>

314
00:11:40.891 --> 00:11:42.570
<v Speaker 1>I feel like people deserve the benefit </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the doubt.</v>

315
00:11:42.571 --> 00:11:45.360
<v Speaker 1>People deserve to make a mistake or get </v>
<v Speaker 1>a joke wrong or you know,</v>

316
00:11:45.361 --> 00:11:47.400
<v Speaker 1>all those kinds of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I feel like yes,</v>

317
00:11:47.401 --> 00:11:49.840
<v Speaker 1>people are allowed to exercise their </v>
<v Speaker 1>free speech on the other enemy.</v>

318
00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:52.590
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't like that joke or I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this or I don't like that,</v>

319
00:11:52.591 --> 00:11:54.070
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't stop there</v>

320
00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:56.170
<v Speaker 2>with what's going on with Dave Chappelle</v>
<v Speaker 2>this week.</v>

321
00:11:56.171 --> 00:11:57.490
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was really actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>

322
00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.290
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with his two specials on Netflix.</v>

323
00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:01.650
<v Speaker 2>People were freaking out about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

324
00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:02.493
<v Speaker 2>his jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>

325
00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:05.430
<v Speaker 2>his jokes about gay people or </v>
<v Speaker 2>transgender people wherever.</v>

326
00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:09.080
<v Speaker 2>Well as comparing transgender people to </v>
<v Speaker 2>black people and you know,</v>

327
00:12:09.081 --> 00:12:10.780
<v Speaker 2>and saying that it's a ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 2>comparison,</v>

328
00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:11.250
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

329
00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:12.340
<v Speaker 2>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually,</v>

330
00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:13.950
<v Speaker 2>after I saw the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the,</v>

331
00:12:13.951 --> 00:12:14.784
<v Speaker 2>all the stuff I went and watched the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first one that I watched half of the </v>

332
00:12:16.661 --> 00:12:18.990
<v Speaker 2>second one and I was falling asleep so I</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't want to watch it anymore,</v>

333
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.400
<v Speaker 2>but I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is funny.</v>

334
00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:23.370
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

335
00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:24.813
<v Speaker 2>Anthony Jeselnik or Daniel tosh would </v>
<v Speaker 2>make these people shit their pants </v>

336
00:12:27.341 --> 00:12:28.174
<v Speaker 2>compared to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to what's going on with this kind of </v>

337
00:12:28.931 --> 00:12:32.440
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's always this drama that seeks to</v>

338
00:12:32.441 --> 00:12:33.040
<v Speaker 2>kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

339
00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:34.780
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't stop at saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like it.</v>

340
00:12:34.781 --> 00:12:35.614
<v Speaker 2>It's often insinuated or outright spoken</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they want to censor it or change </v>

341
00:12:38.321 --> 00:12:39.154
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where I am because I was reading </v>

342
00:12:40.481 --> 00:12:42.580
<v Speaker 2>a piece specifically about chappelle </v>
<v Speaker 2>where they're like,</v>

343
00:12:42.581 --> 00:12:46.150
<v Speaker 2>this guy calls up questions as to why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how far should comedy go?</v>

344
00:12:46.151 --> 00:12:47.440
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

345
00:12:47.441 --> 00:12:48.580
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't call.</v>

346
00:12:48.581 --> 00:12:50.950
<v Speaker 2>And that's when the free speech argument</v>
<v Speaker 2>ends for me.</v>

347
00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:51.813
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're actually now talking about </v>

348
00:12:52.781 --> 00:12:53.890
<v Speaker 2>changing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

349
00:12:53.891 --> 00:12:56.740
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't work with US</v>

350
00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:58.400
<v Speaker 3>comics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just doesn't work.</v>

351
00:12:58.401 --> 00:13:01.370
<v Speaker 3>We're not going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's too many people like it.</v>

352
00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:02.283
<v Speaker 3>And I understand what they're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do because when they live in that world </v>

353
00:13:05.391 --> 00:13:10.340
<v Speaker 3>of cubicles and human resources and very</v>
<v Speaker 3>restricted patterns of behavior that you</v>

354
00:13:10.341 --> 00:13:12.820
<v Speaker 3>have to follow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you live in an office environment and</v>

355
00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:14.180
<v Speaker 3>working in an office environment or </v>
<v Speaker 3>other,</v>

356
00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:15.493
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of people out there that </v>

357
00:13:16.491 --> 00:13:17.324
<v Speaker 3>are boxed into these terrible situations</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you have to pretend to be this </v>

358
00:13:19.851 --> 00:13:23.280
<v Speaker 3>thing that you're not and you again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have any personality,</v>

359
00:13:23.281 --> 00:13:24.114
<v Speaker 3>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not allowed to say anything </v>

360
00:13:24.831 --> 00:13:27.610
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous or silly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you,</v>

361
00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:30.620
<v Speaker 3>you have that kind of environment and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you see someone who's free,</v>

362
00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:32.150
<v Speaker 3>like Dave Chappelle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

363
00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:34.700
<v Speaker 3>you want to stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you can,</v>

364
00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:37.010
<v Speaker 3>if you can point something out that can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh look,</v>

365
00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.540
<v Speaker 3>he's saying something that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>inappropriate.</v>

366
00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:39.830
<v Speaker 3>He's saying something I don't agree </v>
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>

367
00:13:39.831 --> 00:13:41.300
<v Speaker 3>He's saying something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's get them,</v>

368
00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:42.193
<v Speaker 3>let's go get them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then also in defense of the writers </v>

369
00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:48.080
<v Speaker 3>that are writing these articles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

370
00:13:48.081 --> 00:13:48.914
<v Speaker 3>they're in a bizarre environment where </v>
<v Speaker 3>they have to fucking constantly defend </v>

371
00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.740
<v Speaker 3>like their position.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have to constantly get clicks.</v>

372
00:13:57.741 --> 00:13:58.574
<v Speaker 3>They have to constantly get hits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can't just put an article out and </v>

373
00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:02.900
<v Speaker 3>nobody reads it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll lose their job,</v>

374
00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:05.840
<v Speaker 3>so they have to write about something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's inflammatory,</v>

375
00:14:05.841 --> 00:14:06.674
<v Speaker 3>write about something that's salacious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something that's going to get people </v>

376
00:14:08.661 --> 00:14:09.494
<v Speaker 3>excited.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that guy that wrote that thing </v>

377
00:14:11.331 --> 00:14:13.250
<v Speaker 3>about you for the International Business</v>
<v Speaker 3>Times.</v>

378
00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:14.503
<v Speaker 3>I looked into that international </v>
<v Speaker 3>business times and one of the things </v>

379
00:14:16.071 --> 00:14:16.904
<v Speaker 3>about it is that there was a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was a mother Jones article </v>

380
00:14:19.281 --> 00:14:20.114
<v Speaker 3>about that website where they were told </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the people who write articles were </v>

381
00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:29.060
<v Speaker 3>given some ridiculous task like they </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to get 10,000 hits per article.</v>

382
00:14:29.061 --> 00:14:29.894
<v Speaker 3>They write,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that might have for people don't </v>

383
00:14:31.401 --> 00:14:32.234
<v Speaker 3>know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a guy who wrote an article </v>

384
00:14:33.111 --> 00:14:36.370
<v Speaker 3>about Collin where it said kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>funnies.</v>

385
00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:40.850
<v Speaker 3>Collin Moriarty was resigns after </v>
<v Speaker 3>writing a joke,</v>

386
00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:44.930
<v Speaker 3>a racist joke that targeted women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't racist,</v>

387
00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:45.793
<v Speaker 3>even remote in the slightest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you take into account the </v>

388
00:14:49.761 --> 00:14:52.010
<v Speaker 3>environment that these people are forced</v>
<v Speaker 3>work in and</v>

389
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:52.371
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

390
00:14:52.371 --> 00:14:53.204
<v Speaker 1>this guy literally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's forced to write something that's </v>

391
00:14:54.921 --> 00:14:55.754
<v Speaker 1>more fucked up than it really is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to get people excited about </v>

392
00:14:58.671 --> 00:14:59.504
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a way that's going to get them to </v>

393
00:15:00.471 --> 00:15:03.770
<v Speaker 1>click on it and hopefully get him to his</v>
<v Speaker 1>10,000 hit quota.</v>

394
00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:07.940
<v Speaker 1>If that is true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel for him in a way I feel.</v>

395
00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:10.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think he's working for a shitty</v>
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>

396
00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:12.410
<v Speaker 1>but it's the same way I feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

397
00:15:12.411 --> 00:15:13.244
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually,</v>

398
00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:14.163
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I came from the editorial world where </v>

399
00:15:15.171 --> 00:15:16.360
<v Speaker 1>you have to get clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we were getting,</v>

400
00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:19.030
<v Speaker 1>our expectations were way higher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

401
00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:21.210
<v Speaker 1>did you have those kind of requirements?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

402
00:15:21.211 --> 00:15:22.041
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not literally.</v>

403
00:15:22.041 --> 00:15:24.850
<v Speaker 1>I know some sites do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but both sides have all your quota,</v>

404
00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:25.823
<v Speaker 1>a quota or like you get bonuses if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get a certain amount of hits or </v>

405
00:15:27.681 --> 00:15:27.910
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

406
00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:29.750
<v Speaker 1>And we didn't have that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were salaried or whatever,</v>

407
00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:30.613
<v Speaker 1>but you would be fired ultimately if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't writing things that people were </v>

408
00:15:33.741 --> 00:15:34.574
<v Speaker 1>reading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I tried to stay out of my way for </v>

409
00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:37.453
<v Speaker 1>writing inflammatory things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually there are a couple of examples </v>

410
00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:40.783
<v Speaker 1>where I wouldn't write a story because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>felt like it wasn't pertinent to any </v>

411
00:15:44.571 --> 00:15:45.404
<v Speaker 1>information and it was specifically to </v>
<v Speaker 1>assassinate someone's character when we </v>

412
00:15:47.601 --> 00:15:49.610
<v Speaker 1>found a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here you have fucking morals,</v>

413
00:15:49.611 --> 00:15:51.560
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's the door?</v>

414
00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:55.130
<v Speaker 1>Like no room in this business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a,</v>

415
00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:55.993
<v Speaker 1>I had a high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a high profile woman in the gaming </v>

416
00:15:57.681 --> 00:15:58.514
<v Speaker 1>industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell me in an interview that was </v>

417
00:15:59.421 --> 00:16:00.254
<v Speaker 1>unrelated to what I was actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>interviewing her that she'd never was </v>

418
00:16:03.681 --> 00:16:05.960
<v Speaker 1>once the victim of sexism in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>industry ever.</v>

419
00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:07.550
<v Speaker 1>And that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>

420
00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:10.390
<v Speaker 1>I could write this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this isn't why I was there to,</v>

421
00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:12.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't interviewing her about this and</v>

422
00:16:12.081 --> 00:16:14.240
<v Speaker 1>this is going to cause her problems and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not who I am.</v>

423
00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I caused her problem because then people</v>

424
00:16:16.281 --> 00:16:17.114
<v Speaker 1>are going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then people are gonna jump on and be </v>

425
00:16:18.021 --> 00:16:18.590
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

426
00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:19.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I experienced this,</v>

427
00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:20.353
<v Speaker 1>I experienced this and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>diminishing and we'll just cause her </v>

428
00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:21.741
<v Speaker 1>drama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

429
00:16:21.741 --> 00:16:23.220
<v Speaker 1>why would I do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

430
00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:25.040
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is where it drives me crazy.</v>

431
00:16:25.041 --> 00:16:28.910
<v Speaker 1>That's a beautiful example of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>being cool if she can say,</v>

432
00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:31.250
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never experienced any sexism in his</v>

433
00:16:31.251 --> 00:16:32.480
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd be like,</v>

434
00:16:32.481 --> 00:16:33.314
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gaming industry must be really cool </v>

435
00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:36.193
<v Speaker 1>and this woman has managed to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the maze with a bunch of high </v>

436
00:16:38.031 --> 00:16:41.660
<v Speaker 1>fives and people appreciating her work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't that be celebrated?</v>

437
00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:45.140
<v Speaker 1>Not In the gaming and you know what I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying?</v>

438
00:16:45.141 --> 00:16:45.974
<v Speaker 1>Like why does that have to be in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways a target like why is that story at </v>

439
00:16:50.901 --> 00:16:51.734
<v Speaker 1>target?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like wouldn't you assume that if there </v>

440
00:16:53.871 --> 00:16:54.704
<v Speaker 1>is a person who can reach a high level </v>
<v Speaker 1>of prominence in this very complicated </v>

441
00:16:58.911 --> 00:16:59.690
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

442
00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:02.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean the gaming industry is incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated,</v>

443
00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:03.373
<v Speaker 1>especially how weighted everything is </v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to male versus female </v>

444
00:17:05.721 --> 00:17:06.554
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That whole Gamergate shit exposed so </v>

445
00:17:08.121 --> 00:17:08.954
<v Speaker 1>much of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was really confusing to people in </v>

446
00:17:10.791 --> 00:17:12.530
<v Speaker 1>the outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially people like me who don't play</v>

447
00:17:12.531 --> 00:17:13.364
<v Speaker 1>games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

448
00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:16.260
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what in the fucking shooting these gamer</v>

449
00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:16.990
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

450
00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:18.800
<v Speaker 1>It's confusing to me too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the,</v>

451
00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:21.320
<v Speaker 1>the second story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was more pertinent though,</v>

452
00:17:21.321 --> 00:17:24.650
<v Speaker 1>which was this guy had this guy worked </v>
<v Speaker 1>at a big publisher.</v>

453
00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:25.813
<v Speaker 1>He was and he was laid off and he had </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this huge meltdown on social media </v>

454
00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:32.990
<v Speaker 1>and people were writing about it and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

455
00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:36.710
<v Speaker 1>I knew him personally and not wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>really friendly with them at the time,</v>

456
00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:38.150
<v Speaker 1>but I knew him personally and I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

457
00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:39.650
<v Speaker 1>and reverence that we should write about</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

458
00:17:39.651 --> 00:17:41.210
<v Speaker 1>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is this?</v>

459
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:42.380
<v Speaker 1>What is the serving?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

460
00:17:42.381 --> 00:17:43.790
<v Speaker 1>what was the meltdown?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just,</v>

461
00:17:43.791 --> 00:17:44.624
<v Speaker 1>he just had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was just going off about how he was </v>

462
00:17:46.131 --> 00:17:48.740
<v Speaker 1>just angry and sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a young kid that finally got in and</v>

463
00:17:48.741 --> 00:17:50.070
<v Speaker 1>then he his grip on</v>

464
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:52.020
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the job and was and was laid off,</v>

465
00:17:52.021 --> 00:17:52.854
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's fine now he's back in the </v>

466
00:17:53.341 --> 00:17:54.720
<v Speaker 2>industry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the.</v>

467
00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:56.880
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I wasn't cut out to be like this</v>

468
00:17:56.881 --> 00:17:57.714
<v Speaker 2>hard core,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like don't get them journalism like at </v>

469
00:17:59.551 --> 00:18:02.130
<v Speaker 2>any cost because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is going to ruin this.</v>

470
00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:03.810
<v Speaker 2>Like why would I want to contribute to </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

471
00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:04.723
<v Speaker 2>to this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to this.</v>

472
00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:05.843
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get into this industry to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the pile on people to ruin their </v>

473
00:18:08.071 --> 00:18:08.904
<v Speaker 2>lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got into this industry to celebrate </v>

474
00:18:09.901 --> 00:18:12.420
<v Speaker 2>video games,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to tell interesting stories about games,</v>

475
00:18:12.421 --> 00:18:13.254
<v Speaker 2>to challenge people's minds and I always</v>
<v Speaker 2>tried to take that with me where I was </v>

476
00:18:16.471 --> 00:18:17.304
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to write anything for the </v>

477
00:18:18.001 --> 00:18:19.110
<v Speaker 2>clicks I could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could,</v>

478
00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:21.480
<v Speaker 2>I could write.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These ladies had salacious headlines,</v>

479
00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:23.220
<v Speaker 2>a I can write this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

480
00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:25.290
<v Speaker 2>this dirt or this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this stuff.</v>

481
00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:26.580
<v Speaker 2>I heard whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not who I am.</v>

482
00:18:26.581 --> 00:18:27.414
<v Speaker 2>That's not who I want to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'd rather contribute more </v>

483
00:18:29.011 --> 00:18:31.380
<v Speaker 2>positively to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the ecosystem.</v>

484
00:18:31.381 --> 00:18:32.610
<v Speaker 2>Then then be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

485
00:18:32.611 --> 00:18:33.444
<v Speaker 2>I'll just get clicks for this today and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy has got to read the story and </v>

486
00:18:35.071 --> 00:18:37.580
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be in Google and Lexis </v>
<v Speaker 2>nexis forever and it's going to,</v>

487
00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:39.263
<v Speaker 2>for what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I can get 50,000 clicks one day and </v>

488
00:18:40.651 --> 00:18:42.210
<v Speaker 2>then just move on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not gonna be able to move on.</v>

489
00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:45.860
<v Speaker 2>He didn't even do anything that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>worthy of being writing about.</v>

490
00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:46.773
<v Speaker 2>We writing about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are we always after people while </v>

491
00:18:48.241 --> 00:18:50.070
<v Speaker 2>you're mindset is noble?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

492
00:18:50.071 --> 00:18:52.460
<v Speaker 2>it is a great way to look at things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

493
00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:54.870
<v Speaker 2>it's weird that it's so unusual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

494
00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:55.723
<v Speaker 2>and that most people would be more self </v>
<v Speaker 2>serving and would choose the path going </v>

495
00:18:59.031 --> 00:19:02.220
<v Speaker 2>to get them the most clicks and hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got a fucking crack,</v>

496
00:19:02.221 --> 00:19:03.240
<v Speaker 2>a few eggs to make an omelet.</v>

497
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:04.350
<v Speaker 2>That's how it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

498
00:19:04.351 --> 00:19:07.200
<v Speaker 2>And that's not because I don't want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never wanted the Canon to be turned on</v>

499
00:19:07.201 --> 00:19:09.000
<v Speaker 2>me even though it was eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know what I mean.</v>

500
00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:12.960
<v Speaker 2>The cat hates like the try to put out </v>
<v Speaker 2>that energy that you want,</v>

501
00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:14.063
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's positive or at least </v>

502
00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:15.953
<v Speaker 2>constructive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If someone like murder someone in the </v>

503
00:19:17.311 --> 00:19:17.941
<v Speaker 2>gaming industry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

504
00:19:17.941 --> 00:19:18.774
<v Speaker 2>That's noteworthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should probably write about that if </v>

505
00:19:19.891 --> 00:19:21.510
<v Speaker 2>someone just depends on who they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>murdered.</v>

506
00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:22.910
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

507
00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:25.370
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean when someone's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible person that murdered them?</v>

508
00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:27.000
<v Speaker 2>Like punisher style?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

509
00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:28.320
<v Speaker 2>that's different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess we can.</v>

510
00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:31.080
<v Speaker 2>We can have that conversation I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

511
00:19:31.081 --> 00:19:31.861
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what you're saying,</v>

512
00:19:31.861 --> 00:19:32.970
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you.</v>

513
00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:34.110
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's again,</v>

514
00:19:34.111 --> 00:19:36.060
<v Speaker 2>it's knowable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would your mindset,</v>

515
00:19:36.061 --> 00:19:36.894
<v Speaker 2>your philosophy is very noble and I wish</v>
<v Speaker 2>more people shared it and I think that </v>

516
00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:41.093
<v Speaker 2>when there's all these people scrambling</v>
<v Speaker 2>around like we're seeing now and you </v>

517
00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:45.720
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to find their niche and trying to</v>

518
00:19:45.721 --> 00:19:50.721
<v Speaker 2>get attention and you find more of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of a predatory behavior.</v>

519
00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:53.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree as well.</v>

520
00:19:53.491 --> 00:19:54.324
<v Speaker 2>That brings me back to what we were </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying specifically about we feel bad </v>

521
00:19:57.001 --> 00:19:57.834
<v Speaker 2>for these writers at these sites and to </v>
<v Speaker 2>me like the analogy I draw is like I </v>

522
00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:01.530
<v Speaker 2>hate the Tsa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

523
00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:02.633
<v Speaker 2>There's normal people that work for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>TSA that are just trying to do their </v>

524
00:20:04.471 --> 00:20:05.304
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't mean I don't hate the </v>

525
00:20:06.541 --> 00:20:07.374
<v Speaker 2>system that they work under and think </v>
<v Speaker 2>the system should change and it's the </v>

526
00:20:09.811 --> 00:20:10.710
<v Speaker 2>same thing here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like these.</v>

527
00:20:10.711 --> 00:20:11.544
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these guys are victimized by the set of </v>

528
00:20:12.421 --> 00:20:14.280
<v Speaker 2>circumstances in which they under which </v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to write,</v>

529
00:20:14.281 --> 00:20:17.220
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't mean that the system </v>
<v Speaker 2>should remain the same because they need</v>

530
00:20:17.221 --> 00:20:18.054
<v Speaker 2>to write those stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Talk about the TSA because I don't know </v>

531
00:20:19.801 --> 00:20:22.830
<v Speaker 2>more about that than I know about </v>
<v Speaker 2>business or about your business rather.</v>

532
00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:23.611
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what,</v>

533
00:20:23.611 --> 00:20:24.444
<v Speaker 2>what do you hate about the Tsa?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're infringing on your fourth </v>

534
00:20:25.981 --> 00:20:26.814
<v Speaker 2>amendment rights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The warrantless searches a day legally </v>

535
00:20:29.491 --> 00:20:30.181
<v Speaker 2>sees things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

536
00:20:30.181 --> 00:20:31.890
<v Speaker 2>this is written very clearly in the bill</v>
<v Speaker 2>of rights.</v>

537
00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:34.310
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I hate the whole argument of like,</v>

538
00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:34.710
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

539
00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:35.490
<v Speaker 2>you don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

540
00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:36.323
<v Speaker 2>are you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

541
00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:37.293
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you kind of pass by your rights or give </v>

542
00:20:39.241 --> 00:20:40.290
<v Speaker 2>them up when you're in the airport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

543
00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:41.130
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

544
00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:43.380
<v Speaker 2>they're inalienable actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I just have a huge problem.</v>

545
00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:46.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a problem going through a </v>
<v Speaker 2>metal detector or something reasonable.</v>

546
00:20:46.021 --> 00:20:48.090
<v Speaker 2>A reasonable search.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

547
00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:49.773
<v Speaker 1>Well it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of reasonable because there </v>

548
00:20:51.461 --> 00:20:52.294
<v Speaker 1>are carbon fiber blades and all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>different plastic blades that they can </v>

549
00:20:55.271 --> 00:20:59.080
<v Speaker 1>make now that you could really fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody up that are,</v>

550
00:20:59.081 --> 00:21:01.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to show up in a metal </v>
<v Speaker 1>detector.</v>

551
00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:04.930
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it goes back to the first of all,</v>

552
00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:05.853
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that we're going to have </v>

553
00:21:07.571 --> 00:21:09.530
<v Speaker 1>many problems on airplanes anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that they're moving,</v>

554
00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:12.580
<v Speaker 1>moving onto something else and no plane </v>
<v Speaker 1>is going to get hijacked.</v>

555
00:21:12.581 --> 00:21:14.380
<v Speaker 1>And now that everyone knows what's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to happen.</v>

556
00:21:14.381 --> 00:21:15.960
<v Speaker 1>But Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as you think like that,</v>

557
00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:18.010
<v Speaker 1>that's when something happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

558
00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:20.190
<v Speaker 1>that can be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can be a relevant argument.</v>

559
00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:21.800
<v Speaker 1>I also wanna give a shout out that </v>
<v Speaker 1>serious things happen.</v>

560
00:21:21.801 --> 00:21:23.560
<v Speaker 1>My Dad's in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a retired New York City firefighter.</v>

561
00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:25.960
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's quit.</v>

562
00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:27.940
<v Speaker 1>Very cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew people that died that day,</v>

563
00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:29.620
<v Speaker 1>but it's still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

564
00:21:29.621 --> 00:21:32.080
<v Speaker 1>and my dad could have died that day </v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on the circumstances.</v>

565
00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:36.130
<v Speaker 1>Thank God he didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to me it was like I just would.</v>

566
00:21:36.131 --> 00:21:36.964
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the old Benjamin Franklin </v>

567
00:21:37.331 --> 00:21:37.940
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

568
00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:39.310
<v Speaker 1>it's balancing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

569
00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:40.151
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your liberty,</v>

570
00:21:40.151 --> 00:21:42.340
<v Speaker 1>your freedom with security.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that we've,</v>

571
00:21:42.341 --> 00:21:43.174
<v Speaker 1>we've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've given them so much power with </v>

572
00:21:44.411 --> 00:21:45.430
<v Speaker 1>Patriot Act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the Tsa,</v>

573
00:21:45.431 --> 00:21:47.670
<v Speaker 1>with all these things where I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a bad road to go to,</v>

574
00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:49.270
<v Speaker 1>to go down and they're just going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>take more and more.</v>

575
00:21:49.271 --> 00:21:51.040
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the Benjamin Franklin quote?</v>

576
00:21:51.041 --> 00:21:53.590
<v Speaker 1>He who value safety over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

577
00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:55.810
<v Speaker 1>over over liberty deserves neither </v>
<v Speaker 1>safety nor liberty.</v>

578
00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:56.713
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the TSA has a ridiculously hard </v>

579
00:21:59.951 --> 00:22:03.310
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the requirements that people</v>

580
00:22:03.311 --> 00:22:04.910
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the what,</v>

581
00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:09.760
<v Speaker 1>what people request of them to make sure</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're safe and then you give them</v>

582
00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:11.650
<v Speaker 1>$10 an hour or whatever the fuck they </v>
<v Speaker 1>make,</v>

583
00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:12.543
<v Speaker 1>they don't make much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course you get is a bunch of </v>

584
00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:17.103
<v Speaker 1>underqualified people who are tired and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're tired of working like the </v>

585
00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:22.390
<v Speaker 1>constant flow.</v>

586
00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:23.223
<v Speaker 1>If you watch how I like to study people </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the airport because I feel like it's </v>

587
00:22:26.171 --> 00:22:29.950
<v Speaker 1>one of the rare times where you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>just stare at people while they're doing</v>

588
00:22:29.951 --> 00:22:33.910
<v Speaker 1>their job and no one gets weird with you</v>
<v Speaker 1>because everybody staring at that guy or</v>

589
00:22:33.911 --> 00:22:37.870
<v Speaker 1>that girl that's taking your license and</v>
<v Speaker 1>scanning your ticket and all that jazz.</v>

590
00:22:37.871 --> 00:22:40.000
<v Speaker 1>So I just stare at him and I watch how </v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

591
00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:43.120
<v Speaker 1>how they interact with all these people </v>
<v Speaker 1>and people are fucking tired.</v>

592
00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:44.170
<v Speaker 1>That's what I see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

593
00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:45.063
<v Speaker 1>I see frustration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see so many people in these lines and </v>

594
00:22:48.161 --> 00:22:48.994
<v Speaker 1>I see people just being exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the people that have to deal </v>

595
00:22:51.551 --> 00:22:52.780
<v Speaker 1>with the people that don't take their </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoes off.</v>

596
00:22:52.781 --> 00:22:53.730
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to take your shoes out.</v>

597
00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:56.410
<v Speaker 1>Why would I take my shoes off?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take your fucking shoes off man.</v>

598
00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:58.400
<v Speaker 1>You see that kind of thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

599
00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:01.290
<v Speaker 1>It just there on the edge all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're not dealing with them.</v>

600
00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:03.700
<v Speaker 1>We'll start taking shoes off because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going through this thing.</v>

601
00:23:03.701 --> 00:23:06.130
<v Speaker 1>It's not like he has one guy's dealing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with short whole day.</v>

602
00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:09.520
<v Speaker 1>He's dealing with this constant river of</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings that are coming through and</v>

603
00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:10.563
<v Speaker 1>some of them have water bottles and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>got to make sure those dangerous water </v>

604
00:23:12.611 --> 00:23:13.444
<v Speaker 1>bottles don't get on the plane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of stupid shit that goes </v>

605
00:23:16.271 --> 00:23:17.104
<v Speaker 1>with the TSA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how the fuck else are you going to </v>

606
00:23:18.881 --> 00:23:23.560
<v Speaker 1>keep people from bringing shoe bombs or </v>
<v Speaker 1>knives on planes and it's really hard to</v>

607
00:23:23.561 --> 00:23:24.371
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

608
00:23:24.371 --> 00:23:25.450
<v Speaker 1>it is I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't,</v>

609
00:23:25.451 --> 00:23:26.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

610
00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:27.753
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the counterpoint would be to just get </v>

611
00:23:29.201 --> 00:23:30.034
<v Speaker 1>rid of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just walk into a terminal and be </v>

612
00:23:31.091 --> 00:23:32.500
<v Speaker 1>able to get on an airplane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I remember,</v>

613
00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:33.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember too,</v>

614
00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:34.323
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of people do.</v>

615
00:23:34.810 --> 00:23:37.690
<v Speaker 1>We had a security apparatus before nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>11.</v>

616
00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:41.350
<v Speaker 1>These guys out smarter this security </v>
<v Speaker 1>apparatus by doing very specific things,</v>

617
00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:42.303
<v Speaker 1>including like knowing how to fly planes</v>
<v Speaker 1>and doing all the things that you can't </v>

618
00:23:44.351 --> 00:23:45.184
<v Speaker 1>possibly check for and also people get </v>
<v Speaker 1>guns and knives and weapons </v>

619
00:23:48.351 --> 00:23:49.184
<v Speaker 1>intentionally through the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the Tsa all the time to I think </v>

620
00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:52.273
<v Speaker 1>wasn't it something like over 90 percent</v>
<v Speaker 1>of agents that we're trying to get </v>

621
00:23:54.141 --> 00:23:55.730
<v Speaker 1>through things through the TSA </v>
<v Speaker 1>succeeded.</v>

622
00:23:55.731 --> 00:23:57.710
<v Speaker 1>So these are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are the people standing in between</v>

623
00:23:57.711 --> 00:24:01.310
<v Speaker 1>us and isis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People do it accidentally all the time.</v>

624
00:24:01.311 --> 00:24:03.440
<v Speaker 1>They have stuff in their bag and it gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>through and then they go,</v>

625
00:24:03.441 --> 00:24:05.000
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

626
00:24:05.001 --> 00:24:06.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean it happens all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

627
00:24:06.531 --> 00:24:07.364
<v Speaker 1>I knew a guy that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that brought a ton of weed overseas on </v>

628
00:24:09.651 --> 00:24:10.890
<v Speaker 1>accident,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

629
00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:14.720
<v Speaker 1>like that's terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like here's a shit like me too.</v>

630
00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:15.553
<v Speaker 1>Like I go through my bed just for </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything you might leave in there and </v>

631
00:24:16.911 --> 00:24:17.370
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the expert.</v>

632
00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:18.880
<v Speaker 1>I always come through just make sure </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing,</v>

633
00:24:18.881 --> 00:24:20.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you never know what's going to happen,</v>

634
00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:21.830
<v Speaker 1>but to the point he didn't mean to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

635
00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:23.630
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was there,</v>

636
00:24:23.631 --> 00:24:26.710
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

637
00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:27.553
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a perfect system and it's not </v>

638
00:24:29.001 --> 00:24:30.860
<v Speaker 1>going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's just the way it is.</v>

639
00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:32.930
<v Speaker 1>It would be nice if it was more </v>
<v Speaker 1>efficient.</v>

640
00:24:32.931 --> 00:24:34.640
<v Speaker 1>It would be nice that people got paid </v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

641
00:24:34.641 --> 00:24:36.410
<v Speaker 1>It'd be nice if it was easier and </v>
<v Speaker 1>quicker.</v>

642
00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:38.210
<v Speaker 1>There'd be a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be nice,</v>

643
00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:39.343
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know of anybody that's come </v>
<v Speaker 1>up with a better system for scanning </v>

644
00:24:41.751 --> 00:24:45.470
<v Speaker 1>people and making sure that they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>bring guns or bombs or whatever the fuck</v>

645
00:24:45.471 --> 00:24:48.140
<v Speaker 1>it is on an airplane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just bizarre that airplanes are the</v>

646
00:24:48.141 --> 00:24:48.974
<v Speaker 1>one place where we have so much fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>security were malls which are filled </v>

647
00:24:52.461 --> 00:24:54.350
<v Speaker 1>with way more people than your average </v>
<v Speaker 1>plane.</v>

648
00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:58.790
<v Speaker 1>There's something about terror and </v>
<v Speaker 1>flying where it's already terrifying,</v>

649
00:24:58.791 --> 00:24:59.151
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

650
00:24:59.151 --> 00:25:00.320
<v Speaker 1>you think you're scared now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitch,</v>

651
00:25:00.321 --> 00:25:01.154
<v Speaker 1>what if it blows up in the fucking guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude pulls a fucking turbine out of his </v>

652
00:25:04.071 --> 00:25:07.640
<v Speaker 1>bag and wraps around his head and starts</v>
<v Speaker 1>lightened his underwear on fire.</v>

653
00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:08.503
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

654
00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:11.060
<v Speaker 1>That's what we're scared of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're scared of someone taking it to the</v>

655
00:25:11.061 --> 00:25:12.740
<v Speaker 1>next level because people are already </v>
<v Speaker 1>tensed.</v>

656
00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:13.623
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're in a metal tube hurling </v>

657
00:25:14.421 --> 00:25:18.650
<v Speaker 1>through the sky at 500 miles an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it blows up while you're doing that,</v>

658
00:25:18.651 --> 00:25:20.030
<v Speaker 1>it's even more freaky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

659
00:25:20.031 --> 00:25:21.410
<v Speaker 1>It's horrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me a weird.</v>

660
00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:24.470
<v Speaker 1>It's terrifying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's kind of strange.</v>

661
00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:25.633
<v Speaker 1>Whereas like that seems to be like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>preferred method of terror like that </v>

662
00:25:30.021 --> 00:25:33.830
<v Speaker 1>we're really worried about which is why </v>
<v Speaker 1>the TSA exist in the first place because</v>

663
00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:37.850
<v Speaker 1>the volume of humans that go through a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of places,</v>

664
00:25:37.851 --> 00:25:38.684
<v Speaker 1>it's probably commensurate with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>volume of humans that go through the </v>

665
00:25:40.161 --> 00:25:40.870
<v Speaker 1>airport.</v>

666
00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:41.703
<v Speaker 1>Oh sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have a single place that you </v>

667
00:25:42.861 --> 00:25:47.861
<v Speaker 1>could mention that's as strict with what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you carry around as the airport.</v>

668
00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:51.920
<v Speaker 1>You could walk into the fucking mall </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a loaded gun any day of the week,</v>

669
00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:55.520
<v Speaker 1>any day of the week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every single time I walk on the mall,</v>

670
00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:58.770
<v Speaker 1>I am just never checked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody.</v>

671
00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:00.230
<v Speaker 1>Nobody frisks me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't go there.</v>

672
00:26:00.231 --> 00:26:01.064
<v Speaker 1>Any metal detectors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could walk in arm to the fucking </v>

673
00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:05.620
<v Speaker 1>teeth and that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's going to stop you?</v>

674
00:26:05.621 --> 00:26:07.880
<v Speaker 1>The mall security guard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Fuck Outta here and his little.</v>

675
00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:08.783
<v Speaker 1>His little sub during Christmas time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are thousands of people at the </v>

676
00:26:12.141 --> 00:26:13.130
<v Speaker 1>mall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thousands,</v>

677
00:26:13.131 --> 00:26:14.540
<v Speaker 1>thousands and thousands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

678
00:26:14.541 --> 00:26:15.450
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>

679
00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:17.750
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's more like the Israeli </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience where I like this.</v>

680
00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:20.630
<v Speaker 1>This kind of shit can happen at any time</v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere and they're very vigilant about</v>

681
00:26:20.631 --> 00:26:21.860
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've often wondered that as well,</v>

682
00:26:21.861 --> 00:26:24.290
<v Speaker 1>like why doesn't even at a security </v>
<v Speaker 1>checkpoint in a,</v>

683
00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:27.230
<v Speaker 1>in an airport,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why not just do what they're like?</v>

684
00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:29.730
<v Speaker 1>And I really think it's that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

685
00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:30.913
<v Speaker 1>to your point with the mall and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these kinds of things in the public </v>

686
00:26:32.871 --> 00:26:33.704
<v Speaker 1>places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it just speaks to the fact that </v>

687
00:26:34.551 --> 00:26:36.470
<v Speaker 1>most people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a vast majority people are just good,</v>

688
00:26:36.471 --> 00:26:38.510
<v Speaker 1>decent people that want to go about </v>
<v Speaker 1>their lives for sure.</v>

689
00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:40.760
<v Speaker 1>And that these terrorists could target </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of these different places.</v>

690
00:26:40.761 --> 00:26:42.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe because they can't,</v>

691
00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:43.980
<v Speaker 1>but probably more because they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to</v>

692
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:47.250
<v Speaker 2>give themselves away for something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>might be seen as minor.</v>

693
00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:49.830
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like nine slash 11 was a spectacle.</v>

694
00:26:49.831 --> 00:26:51.720
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't only that 3000 some odd people</v>
<v Speaker 2>died.</v>

695
00:26:51.721 --> 00:26:52.554
<v Speaker 2>It was that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the spectacle of killing those </v>

696
00:26:53.581 --> 00:26:57.420
<v Speaker 2>people in that way and so I think that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something about that as well,</v>

697
00:26:57.421 --> 00:26:58.254
<v Speaker 2>which is why I'm more scared about like </v>
<v Speaker 2>a dirty bomb or something like that </v>

698
00:27:00.661 --> 00:27:01.494
<v Speaker 2>today than I am of anyone taking an </v>
<v Speaker 2>airplane over because everyone knows </v>

699
00:27:03.301 --> 00:27:04.134
<v Speaker 2>what happened in 2001.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now someone pulls out a knife on an </v>

700
00:27:05.851 --> 00:27:06.684
<v Speaker 2>airplane and try.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone's just going to tackle that guy </v>

701
00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:10.850
<v Speaker 2>and probably kill him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I'm not sure.</v>

702
00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:11.671
<v Speaker 2>That's why the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

703
00:27:11.671 --> 00:27:13.860
<v Speaker 2>I know the guy tried to blow his shoe up</v>
<v Speaker 2>or something like that on the plane.</v>

704
00:27:13.861 --> 00:27:15.480
<v Speaker 2>That's why we have to take our shoes off</v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

705
00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:17.070
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

706
00:27:17.071 --> 00:27:18.360
<v Speaker 2>To me I'm like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

707
00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:19.203
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the threat has changed that the threat </v>

708
00:27:20.671 --> 00:27:23.040
<v Speaker 2>is evolving and we can be vigilant in </v>
<v Speaker 2>all these ways,</v>

709
00:27:23.041 --> 00:27:23.874
<v Speaker 2>but then I wonder it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it goes back to like Nsa and all these </v>

710
00:27:25.171 --> 00:27:26.004
<v Speaker 2>things like how much are we going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>give the government and how much are we </v>

711
00:27:27.361 --> 00:27:28.650
<v Speaker 2>going to give up in order for safety?</v>

712
00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:30.280
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather live in a more dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 2>world first,</v>

713
00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:31.133
<v Speaker 2>personally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and know that no one's reading my text </v>

714
00:27:32.521 --> 00:27:37.500
<v Speaker 2>messages or no one's throwing out my </v>
<v Speaker 2>hand lotion or harassing.</v>

715
00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:39.150
<v Speaker 2>I saw these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these two women,</v>

716
00:27:39.151 --> 00:27:42.810
<v Speaker 2>Australian women in the airport at Sfo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I came down to La last week,</v>

717
00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:44.153
<v Speaker 2>they were in wheelchairs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were going through all of their </v>

718
00:27:46.321 --> 00:27:47.400
<v Speaker 2>stuff and like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

719
00:27:47.401 --> 00:27:49.630
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck are you doing to these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people?</v>

720
00:27:49.631 --> 00:27:52.080
<v Speaker 2>I just leave them alone and I actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>went up to them afterwards and I'm like,</v>

721
00:27:52.081 --> 00:27:53.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We hate these people too.</v>

722
00:27:53.521 --> 00:27:54.354
<v Speaker 2>Just so you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is not okay with any of us that </v>

723
00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:57.253
<v Speaker 2>were there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were there for like a half an hour </v>

724
00:27:57.940 --> 00:27:59.790
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had these frowns on their faces.</v>

725
00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:00.793
<v Speaker 2>They looked dejected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This might be their first time in the </v>

726
00:28:01.891 --> 00:28:04.860
<v Speaker 2>states for all I know or predict map.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's what happens.</v>

727
00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:06.720
<v Speaker 2>You come over here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>check your shit,</v>

728
00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:08.280
<v Speaker 2>take your pants off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When he got in there,</v>

729
00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:09.540
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you packing?</v>

730
00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:10.920
<v Speaker 2>The harassing old women?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're harassing,</v>

731
00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:11.720
<v Speaker 2>harassing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

732
00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:12.553
<v Speaker 2>I think I saw in jfk once,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like going through like a nun's bang or </v>

733
00:28:15.301 --> 00:28:16.270
<v Speaker 2>something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

734
00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:18.090
<v Speaker 2>This is madness to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

735
00:28:18.091 --> 00:28:20.340
<v Speaker 2>this is not everyone's turning on each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>

736
00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:21.203
<v Speaker 2>but it's not because if it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they didn't go through everyone </v>

737
00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:24.240
<v Speaker 2>thoroughly and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

738
00:28:24.241 --> 00:28:26.500
<v Speaker 2>we're going to let nuns go through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then what happened?</v>

739
00:28:26.501 --> 00:28:30.970
<v Speaker 2>Somebody dressed as a nun and they act </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a terrorist or they are a terrorist.</v>

740
00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:32.070
<v Speaker 2>I liked the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

741
00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:32.933
<v Speaker 2>someone that I don't know much about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you probably know more about it than I </v>

742
00:28:34.441 --> 00:28:35.274
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but someone was telling me a little bit </v>

743
00:28:35.791 --> 00:28:38.070
<v Speaker 2>about the Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way the Israelis do airport security</v>

744
00:28:38.071 --> 00:28:39.290
<v Speaker 2>specifically that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

745
00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:40.750
<v Speaker 2>it's like all about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

746
00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:42.150
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not profiling,</v>

747
00:28:42.151 --> 00:28:42.984
<v Speaker 2>but even based on race or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're profiling based on your </v>

748
00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:44.910
<v Speaker 2>behavior.</v>

749
00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:45.743
<v Speaker 2>And it goes to your point like these are</v>
<v Speaker 2>well paid professional people that know </v>

750
00:28:48.541 --> 00:28:49.374
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>know what they're looking for and </v>

751
00:28:50.581 --> 00:28:51.414
<v Speaker 2>they're in the airport and they see </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone just acting a little weird and </v>

752
00:28:53.371 --> 00:28:55.140
<v Speaker 2>they also do some crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

753
00:28:55.141 --> 00:28:58.290
<v Speaker 2>I had a friend who went there and she </v>
<v Speaker 2>took photos of um,</v>

754
00:28:58.740 --> 00:28:59.820
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

755
00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:04.560
<v Speaker 2>antisemetic a pictures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some like Nazi swastikas on something.</v>

756
00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:05.573
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what the Israeli guys did at </v>

757
00:29:06.271 --> 00:29:07.104
<v Speaker 2>the airport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They shot her computer and they gave it </v>

758
00:29:08.581 --> 00:29:09.414
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

759
00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:10.410
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's.</v>

760
00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:12.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's,</v>

761
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:14.030
<v Speaker 2>that's a little over the top.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

762
00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:16.850
<v Speaker 2>So there's that a little more balanced </v>
<v Speaker 2>than that.</v>

763
00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:20.190
<v Speaker 2>Can we see you a computer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they opened up her computer.</v>

764
00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:22.800
<v Speaker 2>Terrible Israeli accent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not even know where to go with it there.</v>

765
00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:24.013
<v Speaker 2>I just put a fucking hoe she heard dunk </v>
<v Speaker 2>dunk and they gave her back her fucking </v>

766
00:29:26.851 --> 00:29:28.770
<v Speaker 2>computer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a half hour later.</v>

767
00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:29.490
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's some,</v>

768
00:29:29.490 --> 00:29:32.180
<v Speaker 2>that's a little too strong for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

769
00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:33.860
<v Speaker 2>to your point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the point like,</v>

770
00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:34.703
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't like the security theater </v>

771
00:29:35.491 --> 00:29:36.960
<v Speaker 2>aspect of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all know what's going on.</v>

772
00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:39.000
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's being inconvenienced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These people are miserable.</v>

773
00:29:39.001 --> 00:29:40.680
<v Speaker 2>We're miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

774
00:29:40.681 --> 00:29:42.100
<v Speaker 2>it goes back down to no one wants to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make</v>

775
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:43.930
<v Speaker 1>hard decisions or I'll even do what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like really hard work.</v>

776
00:29:43.931 --> 00:29:44.860
<v Speaker 1>Like what works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what doesn't,</v>

777
00:29:44.861 --> 00:29:46.270
<v Speaker 1>let's do studies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's figure out what,</v>

778
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:47.143
<v Speaker 1>what we're doing instead of looking at </v>
<v Speaker 1>people naked and machines and will you </v>

779
00:29:49.541 --> 00:29:50.860
<v Speaker 1>also have to take the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

780
00:29:50.861 --> 00:29:52.750
<v Speaker 1>you don't really see anyone naked </v>
<v Speaker 1>machines anymore.</v>

781
00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:53.820
<v Speaker 1>That's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

782
00:29:53.890 --> 00:29:54.723
<v Speaker 1>but back in the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even back in the day it was just </v>

783
00:29:55.961 --> 00:29:56.830
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on man.</v>

784
00:29:56.860 --> 00:30:00.070
<v Speaker 1>What are you worried about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What people are so silly?</v>

785
00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:02.800
<v Speaker 1>Worried about people seeing me naked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>

786
00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:03.673
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the um,</v>

787
00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:05.560
<v Speaker 1>the thing that gets to me though is </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

788
00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:06.453
<v Speaker 1>how can you make it safer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one has offered up any sort of an </v>

789
00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:11.590
<v Speaker 1>alternative to the TSA that makes any </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense to me.</v>

790
00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:12.853
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard people say the Tsh and </v>

791
00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:15.490
<v Speaker 1>competent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fucking hate them.</v>

792
00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:18.220
<v Speaker 1>They no violation of fourth amendment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's no,</v>

793
00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:21.940
<v Speaker 1>there's no alternatives that I've seen </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're even remotely responsible.</v>

794
00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:23.161
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>

795
00:30:23.161 --> 00:30:23.994
<v Speaker 1>I think it goes back to me of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't speak necessarily to the level </v>

796
00:30:27.161 --> 00:30:28.600
<v Speaker 1>of competence because I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 1>insecurity.</v>

797
00:30:28.601 --> 00:30:29.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what specifically do.</v>

798
00:30:29.921 --> 00:30:31.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what their level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>training is.</v>

799
00:30:31.450 --> 00:30:33.160
<v Speaker 1>It just goes back to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>constitutionality of it.</v>

800
00:30:33.161 --> 00:30:34.480
<v Speaker 1>Like if we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we,</v>

801
00:30:34.910 --> 00:30:37.600
<v Speaker 1>and it brings up those tough questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the same way I feel about about the</v>

802
00:30:37.601 --> 00:30:38.434
<v Speaker 1>second amendment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we start seeding what this means in </v>

803
00:30:40.841 --> 00:30:42.460
<v Speaker 1>certain situations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then before you know it,</v>

804
00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:44.200
<v Speaker 1>they'll just continue to erode it away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

805
00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:46.810
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when I'm like,</v>

806
00:30:47.050 --> 00:30:47.883
<v Speaker 1>this is a warrantless search,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is by definition a warrantless </v>

807
00:30:50.021 --> 00:30:50.854
<v Speaker 1>search.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you went and got John Jay and James </v>

808
00:30:52.810 --> 00:30:53.643
<v Speaker 1>Madison and all these guys and ask the </v>
<v Speaker 1>and somehow told them what the fuck was </v>

809
00:30:55.601 --> 00:30:56.434
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then instead like what does this </v>

810
00:30:57.581 --> 00:30:58.320
<v Speaker 1>look like this.</v>

811
00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:00.280
<v Speaker 1>But you would have to go and get them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then go,</v>

812
00:31:00.281 --> 00:31:03.250
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is isis and this is the internet.</v>

813
00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:04.113
<v Speaker 1>And then this was twitter and this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is how they send information </v>

814
00:31:07.211 --> 00:31:09.660
<v Speaker 1>through pictures with Metadata,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

815
00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:12.550
<v Speaker 1>it's encoded in the picture and you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to break it down.</v>

816
00:31:12.551 --> 00:31:13.940
<v Speaker 1>And that's where the message is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

817
00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:15.550
<v Speaker 1>they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

818
00:31:15.551 --> 00:31:18.500
<v Speaker 1>search everybody that be my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You live in a terrible place to be.</v>

819
00:31:18.530 --> 00:31:19.890
<v Speaker 1>I got to go to bed and really processed </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

820
00:31:20.010 --> 00:31:22.090
<v Speaker 1>Like back in the day when we only had </v>
<v Speaker 1>muskets,</v>

821
00:31:22.091 --> 00:31:22.924
<v Speaker 1>it was so awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if my argument makes sense </v>

822
00:31:24.761 --> 00:31:25.810
<v Speaker 1>to you but it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to me it's,</v>

823
00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:26.693
<v Speaker 1>I just feel like these are certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacred rights that need to be protected </v>

824
00:31:28.181 --> 00:31:29.014
<v Speaker 1>in any way they can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if we want to have a conversation </v>

825
00:31:30.461 --> 00:31:31.294
<v Speaker 1>about like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why we should see this right in this </v>

826
00:31:32.201 --> 00:31:33.034
<v Speaker 1>specific way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have to do it a little more </v>

827
00:31:33.671 --> 00:31:34.480
<v Speaker 1>clearly.</v>

828
00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:35.800
<v Speaker 1>And to me I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

829
00:31:36.010 --> 00:31:37.810
<v Speaker 1>I think people take some of these things</v>
<v Speaker 1>for granted that,</v>

830
00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:39.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's stopping them from,</v>

831
00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:40.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

832
00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:43.060
<v Speaker 1>if these rights continue to erode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then what stops them from busing in your</v>

833
00:31:43.061 --> 00:31:44.170
<v Speaker 1>house at some point and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

834
00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:46.240
<v Speaker 1>we all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can do that.</v>

835
00:31:46.241 --> 00:31:47.074
<v Speaker 1>And there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are some search and seizure </v>

836
00:31:48.791 --> 00:31:49.624
<v Speaker 1>methods that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're really being criticized for </v>

837
00:31:51.731 --> 00:31:53.850
<v Speaker 1>lately in particular for these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

838
00:31:53.890 --> 00:31:56.470
<v Speaker 1>for drug offenses where they just don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>even knock.</v>

839
00:31:56.471 --> 00:31:57.304
<v Speaker 1>They just break open people's doors and </v>
<v Speaker 1>wind up shooting their dogs all the </v>

840
00:32:00.461 --> 00:32:02.410
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shoot people all the time.</v>

841
00:32:02.411 --> 00:32:06.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean there was an article written </v>
<v Speaker 1>recently about the amount of people that</v>

842
00:32:06.731 --> 00:32:07.564
<v Speaker 1>are wounded in unnecessary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how do they describe that kind of </v>

843
00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:15.310
<v Speaker 1>altercation between the cops?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No knock,</v>

844
00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:18.390
<v Speaker 1>no search lists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Warrant or what is the.</v>

845
00:32:18.510 --> 00:32:22.630
<v Speaker 1>I think they just call it no knock break</v>
<v Speaker 1>ins or something like that.</v>

846
00:32:22.631 --> 00:32:23.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to describe it,</v>

847
00:32:23.951 --> 00:32:28.720
<v Speaker 1>but if you've seen the way the dea </v>
<v Speaker 1>treats any sort of situation,</v>

848
00:32:28.721 --> 00:32:31.480
<v Speaker 1>even when they just have marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll kick down the door.</v>

849
00:32:31.481 --> 00:32:33.920
<v Speaker 1>If they see a dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they shoot it and then they,</v>

850
00:32:33.921 --> 00:32:34.754
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they make people huddled up in the </v>

851
00:32:35.831 --> 00:32:39.010
<v Speaker 1>corner after they just murdered your </v>
<v Speaker 1>family pet and oftentimes they find like</v>

852
00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:39.883
<v Speaker 1>a pipe.</v>

853
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:42.260
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's many people that had been called</v>

854
00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:43.433
<v Speaker 3>a on like someone has turned them in or </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone has a said something about them </v>

855
00:32:47.201 --> 00:32:48.950
<v Speaker 3>and it turned out to not be true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

856
00:32:48.951 --> 00:32:49.784
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these people have a grow up and their </v>

857
00:32:50.451 --> 00:32:54.890
<v Speaker 3>business or in their house rather,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and one of them was a former FBI,</v>

858
00:32:55.230 --> 00:32:59.210
<v Speaker 3>a couple that both worked in the FBI.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They kicked in their fucking door,</v>

859
00:32:59.211 --> 00:33:00.620
<v Speaker 3>held them at gunpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole deal.</v>

860
00:33:00.621 --> 00:33:03.410
<v Speaker 3>Went to the basement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were growing tomatoes and they were</v>

861
00:33:03.411 --> 00:33:04.490
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what in the fuck?</v>

862
00:33:04.491 --> 00:33:05.324
<v Speaker 3>These are retired FBI officers and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>dea broke down their door and pointed a </v>

863
00:33:09.861 --> 00:33:13.730
<v Speaker 3>loaded gun in their face and then found </v>
<v Speaker 3>plants.</v>

864
00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:14.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can eat that.</v>

865
00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:15.860
<v Speaker 3>You can eat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can eat.</v>

866
00:33:15.890 --> 00:33:18.260
<v Speaker 3>We do as they can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's actually not bad for you.</v>

867
00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:19.413
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

868
00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:20.150
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

869
00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:21.100
<v Speaker 3>so these things are happening actually.</v>

870
00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:23.240
<v Speaker 3>That one thing sounds familiar with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>family pet being killed.</v>

871
00:33:23.241 --> 00:33:24.860
<v Speaker 3>I think I saw a video on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of it.</v>

872
00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:26.270
<v Speaker 3>It's not just one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>men,</v>

873
00:33:26.271 --> 00:33:29.810
<v Speaker 3>one of them was a mayor and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God dammit.</v>

874
00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:31.670
<v Speaker 3>Was it Washington?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where was it?</v>

875
00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:34.470
<v Speaker 3>Where was it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a mayor who the.</v>

876
00:33:34.471 --> 00:33:38.450
<v Speaker 3>It turned out that the post office,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone in the post office was running a</v>

877
00:33:38.451 --> 00:33:39.284
<v Speaker 3>scam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what they were doing was they were </v>

878
00:33:41.061 --> 00:33:41.894
<v Speaker 3>having,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd sent to other people's addresses </v>

879
00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:45.853
<v Speaker 3>and they were sending it through the </v>
<v Speaker 3>post office and the postman would </v>

880
00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:52.280
<v Speaker 3>intercept the package because he was the</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy who delivered that out of drugs.</v>

881
00:33:52.490 --> 00:33:53.323
<v Speaker 3>So he would get that package and somehow</v>
<v Speaker 3>or another it got intercepted before it </v>

882
00:33:58.011 --> 00:33:58.844
<v Speaker 3>got to the post man and then they had a </v>
<v Speaker 3>dummy post man come and bring it and </v>

883
00:34:01.701 --> 00:34:03.590
<v Speaker 3>then do the whole break down the door.</v>

884
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:05.270
<v Speaker 3>Shoot the dog thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They chased the dog,</v>

885
00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:07.430
<v Speaker 3>a golden lab,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chased them out in the yard.</v>

886
00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:08.353
<v Speaker 3>The dog ran and it was running and </v>
<v Speaker 3>hiding and they shot him in front of </v>

887
00:34:11.211 --> 00:34:12.044
<v Speaker 3>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It turned out that the guy who was the </v>

888
00:34:14.571 --> 00:34:17.630
<v Speaker 3>victim of this and his family who were </v>
<v Speaker 3>held at gunpoint and zip tied,</v>

889
00:34:18.170 --> 00:34:20.420
<v Speaker 3>it was a mayor and so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was like,</v>

890
00:34:20.421 --> 00:34:22.820
<v Speaker 3>what in the fuck are you people doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

891
00:34:22.821 --> 00:34:23.654
<v Speaker 3>what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just killed my dog in front of my </v>

892
00:34:24.951 --> 00:34:27.350
<v Speaker 3>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You traumatized my family.</v>

893
00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:28.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's awful.</v>

894
00:34:28.130 --> 00:34:30.830
<v Speaker 3>But you're making the argument in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>opinion of why we have to take a stand,</v>

895
00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:32.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like why we have to say like in this,</v>

896
00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:34.220
<v Speaker 3>in that situation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

897
00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:36.630
<v Speaker 3>but just not tsa though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

898
00:34:36.631 --> 00:34:37.464
<v Speaker 3>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it is a fourth amendment issue that </v>

899
00:34:38.511 --> 00:34:39.770
<v Speaker 3>we would that or allow them to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>eroding.</v>

900
00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:40.603
<v Speaker 3>No one should be allowed to go into </v>
<v Speaker 3>anyone's home without a warrant no </v>

901
00:34:42.171 --> 00:34:43.004
<v Speaker 3>matter what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but don't you think that you sort of </v>

902
00:34:44.661 --> 00:34:45.494
<v Speaker 3>imply at least a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>consent when you get in that line and </v>

903
00:34:48.021 --> 00:34:49.660
<v Speaker 3>give them your bag and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>

904
00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:50.503
<v Speaker 3>search this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like no one's telling you that you have </v>

905
00:34:52.131 --> 00:34:52.964
<v Speaker 3>to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could choose to fly with no baggage </v>

906
00:34:55.551 --> 00:34:56.384
<v Speaker 3>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could choose if you want to send </v>

907
00:34:58.311 --> 00:34:59.144
<v Speaker 3>your stuff through the mail and it would</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably cost the same amount as it </v>

908
00:35:01.401 --> 00:35:04.540
<v Speaker 3>would to pay that 50 bucks or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 3>it is with southwest.</v>

909
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:07.220
<v Speaker 3>If you wanted to send your package </v>
<v Speaker 3>through the mail,</v>

910
00:35:07.221 --> 00:35:10.190
<v Speaker 3>you could do it that way and just walk </v>
<v Speaker 3>through with nothing on you.</v>

911
00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:11.420
<v Speaker 3>Sure you could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

912
00:35:11.421 --> 00:35:12.860
<v Speaker 3>and you would still have to go through </v>
<v Speaker 3>the machines and all that.</v>

913
00:35:12.861 --> 00:35:13.694
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't dispute that because I agree </v>

914
00:35:14.271 --> 00:35:16.340
<v Speaker 3>with you in the pre nine slash 11 world.</v>

915
00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:17.253
<v Speaker 3>I'm going through the metal detector.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Having your bags and you're looking at </v>

916
00:35:19.401 --> 00:35:20.870
<v Speaker 3>it through the machine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that that's all reasonable.</v>

917
00:35:20.871 --> 00:35:22.490
<v Speaker 3>I just don't like the people being </v>
<v Speaker 3>pulled aside.</v>

918
00:35:22.491 --> 00:35:23.324
<v Speaker 3>Pulled in the rooms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people just going through the kind of </v>

919
00:35:25.581 --> 00:35:28.010
<v Speaker 3>very disrespectfully going through shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't know how to connect to me.</v>

920
00:35:28.011 --> 00:35:28.380
<v Speaker 3>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

921
00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:29.980
<v Speaker 3>I just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that,</v>

922
00:35:30.130 --> 00:35:31.490
<v Speaker 3>is that a hill worth dying on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>In a way?</v>

923
00:35:31.491 --> 00:35:33.980
<v Speaker 3>It is because I feel like it could just </v>
<v Speaker 3>as you made the point,</v>

924
00:35:33.981 --> 00:35:37.860
<v Speaker 3>it's already see that mentality now </v>
<v Speaker 3>seeps into of different places.</v>

925
00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:39.060
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I just don't want to see what the.</v>

926
00:35:39.061 --> 00:35:40.290
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to see the end result of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

927
00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:42.450
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that mentality is also the justification</v>

928
00:35:42.451 --> 00:35:44.490
<v Speaker 3>for the NSA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Being able to look at your text messages</v>

929
00:35:44.491 --> 00:35:48.060
<v Speaker 3>or being able to look at your emails and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the big thing that was exposed by</v>

930
00:35:48.061 --> 00:35:48.840
<v Speaker 3>Edward Snowden.</v>

931
00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:51.810
<v Speaker 3>That really pissed me off that so many </v>
<v Speaker 3>people are so flippant about.</v>

932
00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:52.321
<v Speaker 3>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

933
00:35:52.321 --> 00:35:54.120
<v Speaker 3>if you're not doing anything wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't worry about it.</v>

934
00:35:54.121 --> 00:35:54.954
<v Speaker 3>Like that is wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't say that because you can't </v>

935
00:35:58.081 --> 00:36:01.560
<v Speaker 3>look at everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't just randomly look at everyone</v>

936
00:36:01.561 --> 00:36:02.394
<v Speaker 3>and look at their private information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just can't do that because the </v>

937
00:36:04.951 --> 00:36:07.110
<v Speaker 3>people that are looking at that are just</v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

938
00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:08.063
<v Speaker 3>And that's the problem with the TSA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not even necessarily the issue </v>

939
00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:15.180
<v Speaker 3>being that you get to search people </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff to make sure there's no terrorists</v>

940
00:36:15.181 --> 00:36:16.940
<v Speaker 3>and no people bringing weapons on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>planet.</v>

941
00:36:16.970 --> 00:36:20.040
<v Speaker 3>It's who gets to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who are these people?</v>

942
00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:23.940
<v Speaker 3>Are these people experts or these </v>
<v Speaker 3>people's security experts?</v>

943
00:36:23.970 --> 00:36:25.520
<v Speaker 3>Are they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are they work for the massage?</v>

944
00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:26.341
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are they,</v>

945
00:36:26.341 --> 00:36:29.020
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are they CIA agents or they FBI?</v>

946
00:36:29.050 --> 00:36:30.380
<v Speaker 3>Are they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's looking?</v>

947
00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:32.310
<v Speaker 3>Who these people are they competent?</v>

948
00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:34.320
<v Speaker 3>Why are they doing when you go to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>airport,</v>

949
00:36:34.321 --> 00:36:35.154
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see what you see is a bunch of </v>

950
00:36:35.761 --> 00:36:37.860
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I used to joke about this,</v>

951
00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:43.190
<v Speaker 3>that I think that phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this making sound less insulting than it</v>

952
00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:45.743
<v Speaker 3>used to be the old joke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the idea was that I think that the </v>

953
00:36:48.511 --> 00:36:51.180
<v Speaker 3>people that work at Burger King at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>airport and the TSA,</v>

954
00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:53.790
<v Speaker 3>they're the same people and they just </v>
<v Speaker 3>reach into a hat today.</v>

955
00:36:53.791 --> 00:36:55.050
<v Speaker 3>I got fries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Shit,</v>

956
00:36:55.051 --> 00:36:58.680
<v Speaker 3>I'm on duty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's literally almost like that.</v>

957
00:36:58.681 --> 00:36:59.514
<v Speaker 3>It's like you see people that are just </v>
<v Speaker 3>taking whatever job they can get ahold </v>

958
00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:02.941
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

959
00:37:02.941 --> 00:37:03.774
<v Speaker 3>I feel for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if someone comes along and you </v>

960
00:37:05.131 --> 00:37:06.120
<v Speaker 3>don't have a job and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

961
00:37:06.121 --> 00:37:07.980
<v Speaker 3>the Tsa Siren,</v>
<v Speaker 3>15 bucks an hour.</v>

962
00:37:07.981 --> 00:37:08.814
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cool.</v>

963
00:37:08.850 --> 00:37:09.683
<v Speaker 3>What I gotta do you gotta stand here and</v>
<v Speaker 3>make sure that people don't bring water </v>

964
00:37:11.371 --> 00:37:12.270
<v Speaker 3>bottles on a plane.</v>

965
00:37:12.610 --> 00:37:15.270
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then after like the 50th day,</v>

966
00:37:15.271 --> 00:37:16.104
<v Speaker 3>if people bring them in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take your fucking water bottle out of </v>

967
00:37:17.881 --> 00:37:18.970
<v Speaker 3>the bag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

968
00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:19.850
<v Speaker 3>you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

969
00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:21.390
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my frustration grows in that way,</v>

970
00:37:21.391 --> 00:37:25.240
<v Speaker 3>which is people that in 2017 seemed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have some because you and I,</v>

971
00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:26.700
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you do too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fly all the time.</v>

972
00:37:26.701 --> 00:37:27.200
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you,</v>

973
00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:28.350
<v Speaker 3>you see all types.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

974
00:37:28.351 --> 00:37:31.440
<v Speaker 3>And it's like you always encountered the</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys like have you not flown in the last</v>

975
00:37:31.441 --> 00:37:32.274
<v Speaker 3>15 years ever to know that people try to</v>
<v Speaker 3>walk through the machines with their </v>

976
00:37:34.371 --> 00:37:36.080
<v Speaker 3>shoes on their belt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like what is the time?</v>

977
00:37:36.110 --> 00:37:38.940
<v Speaker 3>And then the convenience get people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't push their bins through the,</v>

978
00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:39.953
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>down to the thing and just leave it </v>

979
00:37:40.981 --> 00:37:42.870
<v Speaker 3>there for someone else to push through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what is going on?</v>

980
00:37:42.871 --> 00:37:43.704
<v Speaker 3>People are just couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was this one guy was really kind </v>

981
00:37:45.351 --> 00:37:46.184
<v Speaker 3>of funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was going through the metal detector </v>

982
00:37:48.931 --> 00:37:49.764
<v Speaker 3>thing and he had a bottle of water in </v>
<v Speaker 3>his bag and because he had a bottle of </v>

983
00:37:52.561 --> 00:37:54.180
<v Speaker 3>water in his bag there to check his bag.</v>

984
00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:55.500
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

985
00:37:55.501 --> 00:37:58.230
<v Speaker 3>when he goes through,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they set your bag aside,</v>

986
00:37:58.231 --> 00:37:59.064
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your thing goes through line that hits </v>

987
00:37:59.671 --> 00:38:01.980
<v Speaker 3>the scanner and they said they pull it </v>
<v Speaker 3>back check.</v>

988
00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:05.130
<v Speaker 3>So this guy was like checking his phone </v>
<v Speaker 3>and look at the bag check.</v>

989
00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:07.410
<v Speaker 3>I mean like 30 seconds had gone by and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>

990
00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:09.750
<v Speaker 3>I have a flight to catch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>excuse me,</v>

991
00:38:09.751 --> 00:38:11.580
<v Speaker 3>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a flight to catch.</v>

992
00:38:11.730 --> 00:38:13.860
<v Speaker 3>And the woman who grabbed his back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

993
00:38:14.010 --> 00:38:14.843
<v Speaker 3>what are the odds?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're at an airport and you got a </v>

994
00:38:16.321 --> 00:38:18.930
<v Speaker 3>flight to catch how crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she goes,</v>

995
00:38:18.931 --> 00:38:20.580
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got a water bottle in your bag,</v>

996
00:38:20.581 --> 00:38:21.620
<v Speaker 3>dummy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she pulled in.</v>

997
00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:23.760
<v Speaker 3>Everybody was laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was funny because the guy was being a</v>

998
00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:26.610
<v Speaker 3>con and the girl just kind of called </v>
<v Speaker 3>them out on it.</v>

999
00:38:26.611 --> 00:38:28.530
<v Speaker 3>And the way she did it was very </v>
<v Speaker 3>humorous.</v>

1000
00:38:28.570 --> 00:38:30.060
<v Speaker 3>I got a good chuckle out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1001
00:38:30.061 --> 00:38:30.570
<v Speaker 3>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you see,</v>

1003
00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:32.333

<v Speaker 3>about showing some respect to the TSA </v>

1004
00:38:34.591 --> 00:38:35.980
<v Speaker 3>agents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have my confrontations</v>

1005
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:37.530
<v Speaker 1>with them somewhat.</v>

<v Speaker 1>going through.</v>

1010
00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:48.933
<v Speaker 1>They were going through a bag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They held my girlfriend's bag but they </v>

1011
00:38:51.161 --> 00:38:52.900
<v Speaker 1>were just holding it for like two point </v>
<v Speaker 1>four minutes.</v>

1012
00:38:52.901 --> 00:38:54.010
<v Speaker 1>We weren't in a rush,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like,</v>

1013

<v Speaker 1>confrontation with the TSA.</v>

00:39:29.711 --> 00:39:30.850
<v Speaker 1>I know what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm from New York,</v>

1034
00:39:30.851 --> 00:39:33.460
<v Speaker 1>I live in new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heard of [inaudible] and my dad's in New</v>

1035
00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:34.091
<v Speaker 1>York City.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Firefighter.</v>

1036
00:39:34.091 --> 00:39:35.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand what happened,</v>

1037
00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:36.813
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like to the point where like where </v>

1038
00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:40.330
<v Speaker 1>they called over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I was a 17 year old kid and they're</v>

1039
00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:41.313
<v Speaker 1>to the point where they called over like</v>
<v Speaker 1>some cops and then they just let me go </v>

1040
00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:44.770
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I was like,</v>

1041
00:39:44.770 --> 00:39:46.570
<v Speaker 1>at that point it was sold in me where </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1042
00:39:46.571 --> 00:39:49.510
<v Speaker 1>why are you being so why are you </v>
<v Speaker 1>disrespecting me?</v>

1043
00:39:49.511 --> 00:39:50.344
<v Speaker 1>Like you're going through my stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I'm a little upset about that or I </v>

1044
00:39:51.851 --> 00:39:52.684
<v Speaker 1>have something to say about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I understand you have to probably </v>

1045
00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:55.210
<v Speaker 1>deal with this all day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't,</v>

1046
00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:56.620
<v Speaker 1>don't because I'm a young kid.</v>

1047
00:39:56.620 --> 00:39:58.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what happened because I'm a</v>
<v Speaker 1>young man.</v>

1048
00:39:58.421 --> 00:39:59.980
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had no idea what my experience was.</v>

1049
00:39:59.981 --> 00:40:02.350
<v Speaker 1>Were you at the funeral for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>firefighter that you knew that died?</v>

1050
00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:04.120
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was so like,</v>

1051
00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:04.741
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1052
00:40:04.741 --> 00:40:07.960
<v Speaker 1>it's that kind of stuff always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's so to seed in me very early</v>

1053
00:40:07.961 --> 00:40:08.794
<v Speaker 1>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where am I?</v>

1054
00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:11.170
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I acknowledged that part of it too,</v>

1055
00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:13.660
<v Speaker 1>where it's like there is a little bit of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a chip on my shoulder with them.</v>

1056
00:40:13.810 --> 00:40:16.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never have a confrontation with them.</v>

1057
00:40:16.541 --> 00:40:17.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm always super friendly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1058
00:40:17.831 --> 00:40:19.810
<v Speaker 1>go through say hi to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

1059
00:40:19.811 --> 00:40:21.340
<v Speaker 1>I just treated it as like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

1060
00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:24.610
<v Speaker 1>this is what I'm doing now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't say this is a big inconvenience.</v>

1061
00:40:24.611 --> 00:40:25.960
<v Speaker 1>I just say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what you have to do.</v>

1062
00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:26.823
<v Speaker 1>This is what I'm doing now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do respect this idea that the fourth </v>

1063
00:40:30.371 --> 00:40:34.060
<v Speaker 1>amendment is being violated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do not see a better alternative.</v>

1064
00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:34.923
<v Speaker 1>If I did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would think that what we should </v>

1065
00:40:36.251 --> 00:40:38.920
<v Speaker 1>definitely follow that protocol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the better alternative is.</v>

1066
00:40:39.310 --> 00:40:40.143
<v Speaker 1>I just think whenever you have non </v>
<v Speaker 1>skilled labor in those sorts of </v>

1067
00:40:43.661 --> 00:40:46.690
<v Speaker 1>situations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the guy working the fries at Burger</v>

1068
00:40:46.690 --> 00:40:48.490
<v Speaker 1>King or the guy who's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1069
00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:49.773
<v Speaker 1>doing that thing at the Tsa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get a wide variety of </v>

1070
00:40:52.181 --> 00:40:53.290
<v Speaker 1>people that need a job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1071
00:40:53.410 --> 00:40:55.810
<v Speaker 1>And some of them are just going to suck </v>
<v Speaker 1>at protocol.</v>

1072
00:40:56.050 --> 00:40:58.570
<v Speaker 1>They're going to suck at being polite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're gonna suck it.</v>

1073
00:40:58.930 --> 00:40:59.763
<v Speaker 1>Recognizing that this old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they have any leeway </v>

1074
00:41:01.781 --> 00:41:02.614
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If some old lady comes through in a </v>

1075
00:41:03.191 --> 00:41:04.024
<v Speaker 1>wheelchair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure you have to check her </v>

1076
00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:07.570
<v Speaker 1>just like you check everybody else and </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't you'll probably get fired.</v>

1077
00:41:07.571 --> 00:41:09.160
<v Speaker 1>They have cameras and watching them </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>

1078
00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:12.310
<v Speaker 1>So it's not their fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The organization itself,</v>

1079
00:41:12.311 --> 00:41:13.144
<v Speaker 1>the Tsa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a diffusion of </v>

1080
00:41:14.381 --> 00:41:16.990
<v Speaker 1>responsibility when you're in one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that's responsible,</v>

1081
00:41:17.350 --> 00:41:18.183
<v Speaker 1>you're at the top and you make these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these laws and then you pass them down </v>

1082
00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:25.470
<v Speaker 1>to the people that are supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>enforce all these regulations that you,</v>

1083
00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:26.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've,</v>

1084
00:41:26.290 --> 00:41:27.220
<v Speaker 1>you've written down.</v>

1085
00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:28.413
<v Speaker 1>There's almost like this is a diffusion </v>
<v Speaker 1>of responsibility from the people that </v>

1086
00:41:30.941 --> 00:41:32.800
<v Speaker 1>have created those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have to enforce them.</v>

1087
00:41:32.801 --> 00:41:33.980
<v Speaker 1>They're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're doing it so</v>

1088
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:35.630
<v Speaker 3>someone else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's someone else's job,</v>

1089
00:41:35.631 --> 00:41:36.464
<v Speaker 3>the $10 an hour guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's his job to go out there and do all </v>

1090
00:41:38.991 --> 00:41:39.824
<v Speaker 3>this stuff and so it's real easy for </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone at the top who's not </v>

1091
00:41:43.041 --> 00:41:43.874
<v Speaker 3>experiencing the interaction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the day to day interaction with these </v>

1092
00:41:45.981 --> 00:41:48.260
<v Speaker 3>human beings to be callous about it or </v>
<v Speaker 3>to make like hard,</v>

1093
00:41:48.261 --> 00:41:49.190
<v Speaker 3>fast rules like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1094
00:41:49.191 --> 00:41:50.390
<v Speaker 3>if someone comes through in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>wheelchair,</v>

1095
00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:52.010
<v Speaker 3>there's no leeway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let them go.</v>

1096
00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:53.173
<v Speaker 3>But then again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to think about it and their </v>

1097
00:41:54.831 --> 00:41:57.050
<v Speaker 3>point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if someone was a terrorist and they</v>

1098
00:41:57.051 --> 00:41:58.020
<v Speaker 3>did decide,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1099
00:41:58.040 --> 00:41:58.910
<v Speaker 3>here's what we do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1100
00:41:58.940 --> 00:41:59.773
<v Speaker 3>they've been proven for a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've used children as suicide </v>

1101
00:42:02.931 --> 00:42:05.630
<v Speaker 3>bombers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so why wouldn't you use an old lady?</v>

1102
00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:07.250
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why wouldn't you use an old man?</v>

1103
00:42:07.251 --> 00:42:08.450
<v Speaker 3>Why don't you use someone in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>wheelchair?</v>

1104
00:42:08.451 --> 00:42:09.284
<v Speaker 3>You certainly could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you have to follow the same protocol </v>

1105
00:42:11.301 --> 00:42:12.134
<v Speaker 3>with everybody.</v>

1106
00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:13.880
<v Speaker 3>Everybody that goes through has to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>scanned.</v>

1107
00:42:13.881 --> 00:42:17.360
<v Speaker 3>You can't let someone need not be </v>
<v Speaker 3>scanned just because they're old.</v>

1108
00:42:17.570 --> 00:42:20.000
<v Speaker 3>Like you've reached a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>years on this planet.</v>

1109
00:42:20.001 --> 00:42:21.860
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't do anything fucking crazy </v>
<v Speaker 3>would you,</v>

1110
00:42:21.861 --> 00:42:22.910
<v Speaker 3>bob,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1111
00:42:22.911 --> 00:42:23.780
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not me.</v>

1112
00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:24.450
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1113
00:42:24.450 --> 00:42:24.920
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1114
00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:27.590
<v Speaker 3>you can't think like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because if you do think like that,</v>

1115
00:42:27.591 --> 00:42:30.860
<v Speaker 3>that will be your vulnerability.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That will be the path in that someone is</v>

1116
00:42:30.861 --> 00:42:32.960
<v Speaker 3>looking to do something horrible will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will take.</v>

1117
00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:36.110
<v Speaker 3>I think that the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the solution drove to bridge the</v>

1118
00:42:36.111 --> 00:42:36.944
<v Speaker 3>gap in the way we feel about this and </v>
<v Speaker 3>come to some sort of consensus what </v>

1119
00:42:39.321 --> 00:42:40.154
<v Speaker 3>might be in this conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A little with my small government kind </v>

1120
00:42:42.231 --> 00:42:43.550
<v Speaker 3>of mentality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's just to say like,</v>

1121
00:42:44.050 --> 00:42:44.883
<v Speaker 3>to ask the kind of fundamental question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why are these people being paid 10 or </v>

1122
00:42:46.701 --> 00:42:47.534
<v Speaker 3>$15 an hour back to the Israeli </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience with these guys that are </v>

1123
00:42:49.221 --> 00:42:50.054
<v Speaker 3>professionals there.</v>

1124
00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:52.180
<v Speaker 3>They take a lot of pride in their work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They make maybe 80,000,</v>

1125
00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:54.120
<v Speaker 3>$100,000 a year and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1126
00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:55.760
<v Speaker 3>not that they necessarily need to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>that much money,</v>

1127
00:42:55.761 --> 00:42:56.594
<v Speaker 3>but people that are professional,</v>
<v Speaker 3>should we invest more money and making </v>

1128
00:42:58.221 --> 00:42:59.440
<v Speaker 3>the smarter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1129
00:42:59.450 --> 00:43:00.283
<v Speaker 3>it would be a substantial increase in </v>
<v Speaker 3>our airline fees and other things I'm </v>

1130
00:43:03.531 --> 00:43:04.364
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1131
00:43:04.610 --> 00:43:06.270
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe going,</v>

1132
00:43:06.830 --> 00:43:09.620
<v Speaker 3>well we already pay a little bit of that</v>
<v Speaker 3>but with tickets,</v>

1133
00:43:09.621 --> 00:43:11.480
<v Speaker 3>but I think homeland security might be </v>
<v Speaker 3>able to.</v>

1134
00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:13.880
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we stopped dropping bombs on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch of countries and take some of that</v>

1135
00:43:13.881 --> 00:43:15.580
<v Speaker 3>money and put it on and put it on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1136
00:43:15.890 --> 00:43:19.580
<v Speaker 3>into that area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What else you suggest no more drones.</v>

1137
00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:22.160
<v Speaker 3>Fucking communists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who is this guy?</v>

1138
00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:23.630
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1139
00:43:23.631 --> 00:43:27.290
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Israeli thing is interesting because</v>

1140
00:43:27.350 --> 00:43:28.183
<v Speaker 3>Israel has a mandatory military service </v>
<v Speaker 3>requirement that I am not in favor for </v>

1141
00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:36.210
<v Speaker 3>favor of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I am a part of me.</v>

1142
00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:39.780
<v Speaker 3>I feel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel the benefit of it like you've,</v>

1143
00:43:39.910 --> 00:43:43.220
<v Speaker 3>it's very rare to meet people that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>more patriotic than Israelis,</v>

1144
00:43:43.570 --> 00:43:44.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that are more,</v>

1145
00:43:44.871 --> 00:43:48.230
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more committed to their country.</v>

1146
00:43:48.290 --> 00:43:49.880
<v Speaker 3>It's like a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1147
00:43:49.881 --> 00:43:54.881
<v Speaker 3>they feel very marginalized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very targeted and rightly so.</v>

1148
00:43:55.310 --> 00:43:56.143
<v Speaker 3>And so because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the people that I've met that work </v>

1149
00:43:58.101 --> 00:44:00.090
<v Speaker 3>for the Israeli army or that have been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1150
00:44:00.350 --> 00:44:01.183
<v Speaker 3>soldiers over there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have this very intense sort of a </v>

1151
00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:06.333
<v Speaker 3>view of altercation and of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you're forced to do two years </v>

1152
00:44:09.861 --> 00:44:11.870
<v Speaker 3>of military service mandatory like they </v>
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>

1153
00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:16.010
<v Speaker 3>you also have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're invested in this whole project of</v>

1154
00:44:16.011 --> 00:44:17.240
<v Speaker 3>Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's no,</v>

1155
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:18.103
<v Speaker 3>there's no veterans and civilians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's a fucking veteran and you </v>

1156
00:44:21.681 --> 00:44:22.514
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you deal with a country where it </v>

1157
00:44:23.111 --> 00:44:25.670
<v Speaker 3>literally everyone does some military </v>
<v Speaker 3>service.</v>

1158
00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:28.520
<v Speaker 3>There's everybody's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's more chips in the game,</v>

1159
00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:30.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are all in different,</v>

1160
00:44:30.990 --> 00:44:32.100
<v Speaker 3>different scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1161
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:32.933
<v Speaker 2>I think I went to school with this girl </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was Israeli when I was at </v>

1162
00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:35.933
<v Speaker 2>northeastern and Boston and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember very clearly she had this </v>

1163
00:44:39.070 --> 00:44:39.903
<v Speaker 2>very unassuming you would never know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she had this picture of her with an </v>

1164
00:44:42.271 --> 00:44:44.040
<v Speaker 2>assault rifle shooting at a range.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

1165
00:44:44.041 --> 00:44:45.480
<v Speaker 2>this is so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so interesting.</v>

1166
00:44:45.481 --> 00:44:46.314
<v Speaker 2>It conflicts because I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like one of those things where I'm </v>

1167
00:44:47.521 --> 00:44:48.354
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1168
00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:49.313
<v Speaker 2>I can see both sides of this where um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that the state should have </v>

1169
00:44:51.961 --> 00:44:54.020
<v Speaker 2>the right to exert that kind of power </v>
<v Speaker 2>over a person,</v>

1170
00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:56.550
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time does it have to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>military service?</v>

1171
00:44:56.551 --> 00:44:58.980
<v Speaker 2>And when a person turns 18,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it fair to say like,</v>

1172
00:44:59.010 --> 00:44:59.843
<v Speaker 2>just spend a couple of years and give </v>
<v Speaker 2>something to your country and whether </v>

1173
00:45:02.941 --> 00:45:03.760
<v Speaker 2>it's you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1174
00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:04.593
<v Speaker 2>you work in a soup kitchen or something </v>
<v Speaker 2>or you do something that is for the </v>

1175
00:45:08.191 --> 00:45:10.860
<v Speaker 2>society and really have some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some investment in some skin in the game</v>

1176
00:45:10.861 --> 00:45:13.710
<v Speaker 2>in society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that that's a nice idea,</v>

1177
00:45:13.711 --> 00:45:14.544
<v Speaker 2>but I think that the way I feel about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the state's exertion of power over the </v>

1178
00:45:16.141 --> 00:45:18.630
<v Speaker 2>individual kind of overrides that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I like,</v>

1179
00:45:18.690 --> 00:45:21.630
<v Speaker 2>I like the idea in principle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the idea of saying like,</v>

1180
00:45:21.631 --> 00:45:22.464
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's also easy for me is a 32 year </v>

1181
00:45:23.521 --> 00:45:24.370
<v Speaker 2>old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be long,</v>

1182
00:45:24.890 --> 00:45:25.471
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be like,</v>

1183
00:45:25.471 --> 00:45:26.250
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys do it.</v>

1184
00:45:26.250 --> 00:45:28.380
<v Speaker 2>So at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand that argument as well.</v>

1185
00:45:28.410 --> 00:45:30.420
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm completely in agreement with</v>

1186
00:45:30.421 --> 00:45:32.970
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love the idea that they're all in,</v>

1187
00:45:32.971 --> 00:45:35.520
<v Speaker 3>but I don't want anybody in forcing that</v>
<v Speaker 3>on me and I want.</v>

1188
00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:36.413
<v Speaker 3>I want a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If a kid grows up in America and then </v>

1189
00:45:38.701 --> 00:45:39.451
<v Speaker 3>decides,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey man,</v>

1190
00:45:39.451 --> 00:45:41.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to backpack across the country</v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

1191
00:45:41.551 --> 00:45:42.700
<v Speaker 3>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to join the army.</v>

1192
00:45:42.701 --> 00:45:43.800
<v Speaker 3>You fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want that.</v>

1193
00:45:43.830 --> 00:45:44.460
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want.</v>

1194
00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:46.520
<v Speaker 3>I want people to be doing whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck they want.</v>

1195
00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:47.271
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to be a,</v>

1196
00:45:47.271 --> 00:45:49.920
<v Speaker 3>a fly fishing guide in Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1197
00:45:49.921 --> 00:45:51.780
<v Speaker 3>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to clean machine guns,</v>

1198
00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:52.410
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1199
00:45:52.410 --> 00:45:56.280
<v Speaker 3>Fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love the fact that America has so much</v>

1200
00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:59.280
<v Speaker 3>ultimate freedom for like what you </v>
<v Speaker 3>choose to do and not to do.</v>

1201
00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:00.293
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we live in this sort of a experiment in </v>

1202
00:46:03.511 --> 00:46:06.990
<v Speaker 3>self government and you can not </v>
<v Speaker 3>participate if you want to.</v>

1203
00:46:07.110 --> 00:46:08.410
<v Speaker 3>I liked that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to.</v>

1204
00:46:08.411 --> 00:46:09.690
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to vote.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1205
00:46:09.691 --> 00:46:13.230
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that everybody should </v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck off and not vote,</v>

1206
00:46:13.530 --> 00:46:16.140
<v Speaker 3>but I am saying that I liked that it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>your option.</v>

1207
00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:17.333
<v Speaker 3>Me Too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they have compulsory voting in </v>

1208
00:46:18.331 --> 00:46:19.560
<v Speaker 3>Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to say,</v>

1209
00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:21.990

<v Speaker 3>Fucking kangaroos everywhere.</v>

00:46:22.290 --> 00:46:23.940
<v Speaker 3>Crocodiles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>spider is poisonous.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Bugs and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got The place.</v>

1212
00:46:25.441 --> 00:46:26.920
<v Speaker 3>Looks horrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the,</v>

1213
00:46:26.921 --> 00:46:27.754
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1214
00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:30.180

<v Speaker 3>I lived there.</v>

1215
00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:32.960
<v Speaker 3>That's number three on my list yet we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>number one.</v>

1216
00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:33.811
<v Speaker 3>America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>number two,</v>

1217
00:46:33.811 --> 00:46:35.250
<v Speaker 3>Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 3>number three,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Australia.</v>

1219
00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:37.080
<v Speaker 2>That seems like a pretty reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's,</v>

1220
00:46:37.081 --> 00:46:39.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean I could list just being in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>gaming industry.</v>

1221
00:46:39.751 --> 00:46:42.270
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people I really love that came from</v>

1222
00:46:42.271 --> 00:46:43.500
<v Speaker 2>Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really friendly people,</v>

1223
00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:44.513
<v Speaker 2>but the interior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that country sounds like a just an </v>

1224
00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:48.950
<v Speaker 2>absolute fucking shit show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy,</v>

1225
00:46:49.010 --> 00:46:49.310
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

1226
00:46:49.310 --> 00:46:52.010
<v Speaker 3>it's also really gorgeous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's wild.</v>

1227
00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:53.840
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a good buddy who lives over there</v>

1228
00:46:53.850 --> 00:46:56.030
<v Speaker 3>who goes into the interior all the time </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he,</v>

1229
00:46:56.090 --> 00:46:56.923
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's the one who sent me a video of a </v>

1230
00:46:58.430 --> 00:47:01.760
<v Speaker 3>brown snake getting killed by some evil </v>
<v Speaker 3>spider.</v>

1231
00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:02.913
<v Speaker 3>There's some brown snake kills you </v>
<v Speaker 3>instantly and there's some evil spider </v>

1232
00:47:06.291 --> 00:47:07.760
<v Speaker 3>that was killing the brown snake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1233
00:47:07.761 --> 00:47:09.260
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kind of a shit hole.</v>

1234
00:47:09.261 --> 00:47:11.300
<v Speaker 3>Do you live in Adam?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

1235
00:47:11.420 --> 00:47:13.220
<v Speaker 3>he's a madman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's out there living in that shit.</v>

1236
00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:16.220
<v Speaker 3>A man like me would not be able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>survive their camps out there.</v>

1237
00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:19.310
<v Speaker 3>He goes out into the Bush and shoots </v>
<v Speaker 3>buffalo's a bow and arrow.</v>

1238
00:47:19.311 --> 00:47:22.280
<v Speaker 3>He's and he's a maniac,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the area of,</v>

1239
00:47:22.310 --> 00:47:25.220
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Australia is the size of the continental</v>

1240
00:47:25.221 --> 00:47:26.054
<v Speaker 3>United States,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's as many people as less than </v>

1241
00:47:29.561 --> 00:47:30.130
<v Speaker 3>the amount of people</v>

1242
00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:33.190
<v Speaker 1>that live in the greater Los Angeles </v>
<v Speaker 1>area live in the entire.</v>

1243
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.210
<v Speaker 1>This whole fucking continent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia.</v>

1244
00:47:37.211 --> 00:47:38.170
<v Speaker 1>It's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible.</v>

1245
00:47:38.171 --> 00:47:38.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like Perth on the,</v>

1246
00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:39.813
<v Speaker 1>on the west coast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it's just the Sydney and </v>

1247
00:47:40.691 --> 00:47:41.650
<v Speaker 1>Melbourne,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right on the east coast.</v>

1248
00:47:41.651 --> 00:47:44.210
<v Speaker 1>And that's basically cleans Queensland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Queensland.</v>

1249
00:47:44.310 --> 00:47:45.143
<v Speaker 1>There's a few other places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the bottom line is there's a giant </v>

1250
00:47:47.981 --> 00:47:51.130
<v Speaker 1>percentage of that place where you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to get caught dead.</v>

1251
00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:51.650
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1252
00:47:51.650 --> 00:47:52.810
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't.</v>

1253
00:47:53.050 --> 00:47:55.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm the kind of guy with like where I </v>
<v Speaker 1>see a spider and I have to argue with my</v>

1254
00:47:55.991 --> 00:47:57.310
<v Speaker 1>girlfriend who is going to kill it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't,</v>

1255
00:47:57.311 --> 00:47:58.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be really.</v>

1256
00:47:58.901 --> 00:47:59.734
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hear you.</v>

1257
00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:01.860
<v Speaker 1>We step up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always,</v>

1258
00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:03.220
<v Speaker 1>it's always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it always ends up on me,</v>

1259
00:48:03.221 --> 00:48:04.120
<v Speaker 1>but I hate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate,</v>

1260
00:48:04.610 --> 00:48:05.770
<v Speaker 1>I hate spiders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1261
00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:07.330
<v Speaker 1>so if I see even these little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate them.</v>

1262
00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:08.950
<v Speaker 1>Do you get a rack in a phobia?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know?</v>

1263
00:48:08.951 --> 00:48:10.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I have that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to like,</v>

1264
00:48:10.061 --> 00:48:11.800
<v Speaker 1>if I see one calling me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to run out the house,</v>

1265
00:48:11.801 --> 00:48:12.211
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1266
00:48:12.211 --> 00:48:13.044
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this thing in a job I have to like </v>

1267
00:48:13.681 --> 00:48:16.240
<v Speaker 1>really think about my strategy on how </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to kill this thing.</v>

1268
00:48:17.340 --> 00:48:19.770
<v Speaker 1>It's one of those things where I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if I was in Austria,</v>

1269
00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:21.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm just being honest with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was in Australia,</v>

1270
00:48:22.110 --> 00:48:24.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'd be super careful in Australia.</v>

1271
00:48:24.311 --> 00:48:24.911
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

1272
00:48:24.911 --> 00:48:26.620
<v Speaker 1>I see some of these things when people </v>
<v Speaker 1>were outside barbecuing,</v>

1273
00:48:26.621 --> 00:48:28.120
<v Speaker 1>even in Melbourne or something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1274
00:48:28.450 --> 00:48:32.680
<v Speaker 1>and the camera pans the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a brown snake.</v>

1275
00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:34.330
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holy Jesus,</v>

1276
00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:35.381
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't.</v>

1277
00:48:35.381 --> 00:48:38.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The waters are filled with sharks.</v>

1278
00:48:39.110 --> 00:48:41.350
<v Speaker 1>If you get past the sharks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're filled with jelly fish.</v>

1279
00:48:41.710 --> 00:48:43.840
<v Speaker 1>You get to the shore is poisonous </v>
<v Speaker 1>spiders.</v>

1280
00:48:43.841 --> 00:48:46.210
<v Speaker 1>You go into the hills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is Poisons fucking snake.</v>

1281
00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:48.820
<v Speaker 1>What is it about that part of the world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like ruthless unbelieved.</v>

1282
00:48:48.830 --> 00:48:49.663
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were the man of war and all that </v>

1283
00:48:50.471 --> 00:48:51.810
<v Speaker 1>kind of stuff in the water and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1284
00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:52.713
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the box jellyfish or the scariest can </v>

1285
00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:59.680
<v Speaker 1>kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They kill you if you fall into some sort</v>

1286
00:48:59.681 --> 00:49:01.990
<v Speaker 1>of a patch or what do they call them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A school of Jellyfish.</v>

1287
00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:05.830
<v Speaker 1>If you accidentally stumble upon one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a dead person.</v>

1288
00:49:06.070 --> 00:49:07.000
<v Speaker 1>You're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1289
00:49:07.001 --> 00:49:08.620
<v Speaker 1>they just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're dead instantly.</v>

1290
00:49:09.130 --> 00:49:10.660
<v Speaker 1>That's really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're a little tiny guys,</v>

1291
00:49:10.661 --> 00:49:11.494
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>To someone that's warm on you in their </v>

1292
00:49:13.691 --> 00:49:14.524
<v Speaker 1>heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're jellyfish are always scary </v>

1293
00:49:15.611 --> 00:49:17.820
<v Speaker 1>because growing up on long island we had</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously harmless jellyfish,</v>

1294
00:49:17.830 --> 00:49:21.150
<v Speaker 1>but they would wash up on the shore </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes and I used to look at them.</v>

1295
00:49:21.150 --> 00:49:21.621
<v Speaker 1>I was kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1296
00:49:21.621 --> 00:49:23.110
<v Speaker 1>these are so strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is this,</v>

1297
00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:25.960
<v Speaker 1>Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A spider.</v>

1298
00:49:25.961 --> 00:49:27.550
<v Speaker 1>Killing a brown snake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another one,</v>

1299
00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:29.890
<v Speaker 1>so spiders just eat ground snakes all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

1300
00:49:29.891 --> 00:49:33.220
<v Speaker 1>He's according that the weapons for cool</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine webs are awesome.</v>

1301
00:49:33.550 --> 00:49:34.900
<v Speaker 1>It's horrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>

1302
00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:36.700
<v Speaker 1>not to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Snakes or cons.</v>

1303
00:49:37.090 --> 00:49:40.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't know whose team I'm on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm on team snake more than I am</v>

1304
00:49:40.091 --> 00:49:41.320
<v Speaker 1>on a team sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I am too,</v>

1305
00:49:41.321 --> 00:49:42.940
<v Speaker 1>just because they're less scary to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus,</v>

1306
00:49:43.030 --> 00:49:43.863
<v Speaker 1>well you can eat spiders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently tarantulas are delicious and </v>

1307
00:49:46.181 --> 00:49:47.014
<v Speaker 1>they cook them a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the Amazon they have these big </v>

1308
00:49:48.911 --> 00:49:51.970
<v Speaker 1>spiders that they cook and there are a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot like crabs.</v>

1309
00:49:51.971 --> 00:49:52.804
<v Speaker 1>They taste like crabs and apparently </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're really similar in their lineage </v>

1310
00:49:55.870 --> 00:49:57.130
<v Speaker 1>or genetic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

1311
00:49:57.220 --> 00:49:59.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you put a piece of.</v>

1312
00:49:59.090 --> 00:50:00.010
<v Speaker 1>If you put a spider and from it.</v>

1313
00:50:00.010 --> 00:50:01.260
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be fine.</v>

1314
00:50:01.270 --> 00:50:02.480
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if I didn't know what it was,</v>

1315
00:50:02.490 --> 00:50:03.790
<v Speaker 1>if you know it's not gonna kill you when</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's dead.</v>

1316
00:50:03.830 --> 00:50:05.340
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's good,</v>

1317
00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:06.400
<v Speaker 1>if it's good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's delectable,</v>

1318
00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:09.870
<v Speaker 1>that's why I shouldn't say I've eaten </v>
<v Speaker 1>spiders before on fear factor.</v>

1319
00:50:09.910 --> 00:50:13.960
<v Speaker 1>I have eaten a couple of spiders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I eat a cave African cave dwelling.</v>

1320
00:50:13.961 --> 00:50:15.400
<v Speaker 1>Spider.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie just freaked out.</v>

1321
00:50:15.460 --> 00:50:16.690
<v Speaker 1>You must have seen some things on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>

1322
00:50:16.691 --> 00:50:17.021
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1323
00:50:17.021 --> 00:50:17.460
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm.</v>

1324
00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:19.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty numb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1325
00:50:19.601 --> 00:50:21.670
<v Speaker 1>I guess that explains a lot of your kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of more.</v>

1326
00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:24.040
<v Speaker 1>You've seen it all like an old </v>
<v Speaker 1>prostitute.</v>

1327
00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:27.040
<v Speaker 1>I've seen too much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1328
00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:28.010
<v Speaker 1>No 50 year</v>

1329
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:28.843
<v Speaker 3>old prostitute in Holland.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like whatever smoking a cigarette you </v>

1330
00:50:31.550 --> 00:50:33.830
<v Speaker 3>can show her do to me that lipstick on </v>
<v Speaker 3>my teeth.</v>

1331
00:50:33.831 --> 00:50:36.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm not even bothered to clean it off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1332
00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:39.740
<v Speaker 3>I'm curious about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you brought it up before,</v>

1333
00:50:39.741 --> 00:50:41.400
<v Speaker 3>but what is your stance on Snowden?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1334
00:50:41.401 --> 00:50:43.640
<v Speaker 3>it seems like you're against the NSA and</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that kinda stuff,</v>

1335
00:50:43.641 --> 00:50:45.590
<v Speaker 3>but what is your stance on him?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm curious.</v>

1336
00:50:45.591 --> 00:50:47.360
<v Speaker 3>Like what do you think he should come </v>
<v Speaker 3>back?</v>

1337
00:50:47.361 --> 00:50:48.194
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that he is a patriot?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's more of a Patriot than he </v>

1338
00:50:51.051 --> 00:50:52.310
<v Speaker 3>is a trader.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree,</v>

1339
00:50:52.460 --> 00:50:53.293
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's a very complex issue </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you give away national secrets and </v>

1340
00:50:58.430 --> 00:51:02.480
<v Speaker 3>your you have signed an oath that you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>not going to give away national secrets.</v>

1341
00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:05.450
<v Speaker 3>You sign an oath of secrecy and then you</v>
<v Speaker 3>give away national secrets,</v>

1342
00:51:06.350 --> 00:51:09.680
<v Speaker 3>but if those national secrets are in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>case of Edward Snowden,</v>

1343
00:51:09.790 --> 00:51:14.790
<v Speaker 3>they're very detrimental to what we </v>
<v Speaker 3>think of as freedom in this country.</v>

1344
00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:16.233
<v Speaker 3>Like if you have a bunch of people like </v>
<v Speaker 3>you or me or Jamie or it just a normal </v>

1345
00:51:19.401 --> 00:51:21.710
<v Speaker 3>person and they work at the NSA and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>can,</v>

1346
00:51:21.711 --> 00:51:23.030
<v Speaker 3>as he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

1347
00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:25.820
<v Speaker 3>spy on their ex girlfriend's read their </v>
<v Speaker 3>emails,</v>

1348
00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:27.890
<v Speaker 3>go into anybody's email that you want to</v>
<v Speaker 3>check,</v>

1349
00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:28.933
<v Speaker 3>check them out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then we were also being lied to by </v>

1350
00:51:32.061 --> 00:51:32.894
<v Speaker 3>the government about the extent of these</v>
<v Speaker 3>searches and he exposed that that the </v>

1351
00:51:35.571 --> 00:51:37.370
<v Speaker 3>president was saying it's just metadata </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was saying,</v>

1352
00:51:37.371 --> 00:51:38.540
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not just metadata.</v>

1353
00:51:38.541 --> 00:51:39.374
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the actual emails is the actual </v>

1354
00:51:40.641 --> 00:51:43.250
<v Speaker 3>text messages.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See actual photos that you're sending to</v>

1355
00:51:43.251 --> 00:51:44.420
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can get those.</v>

1356
00:51:44.450 --> 00:51:47.030
<v Speaker 3>They have all of those and that they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>storing all this stuff.</v>

1357
00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:48.073
<v Speaker 3>People were horrified,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is also something that was </v>

1358
00:51:49.611 --> 00:51:50.444
<v Speaker 3>exposed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was an NSA whistleblower from </v>

1359
00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:55.400
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to say 2011.</v>

1360
00:51:55.550 --> 00:51:59.420
<v Speaker 3>There was a guy who was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he was a coder and the NSA,</v>

1361
00:51:59.421 --> 00:52:03.090
<v Speaker 3>and he's gone public with this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he didn't go public with this in the</v>

1362
00:52:03.091 --> 00:52:03.924
<v Speaker 3>same way where he dumped a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>documents and and let people go through </v>

1363
00:52:07.701 --> 00:52:11.900
<v Speaker 3>them like Edward Snowden did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he also didn't face the consequences</v>

1364
00:52:11.901 --> 00:52:15.260
<v Speaker 3>that Edward Snowden did as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't really.</v>

1365
00:52:15.500 --> 00:52:16.333
<v Speaker 3>He was criticized and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was debated whether or not him </v>

1366
00:52:19.371 --> 00:52:22.040
<v Speaker 3>talking about it at all was legal or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it should be able to,</v>

1367
00:52:22.041 --> 00:52:24.730
<v Speaker 3>but ultimately he didn't face the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of consequences.</v>

1368
00:52:24.740 --> 00:52:26.630
<v Speaker 3>Mean Edward Snowden can't live in </v>
<v Speaker 3>America anymore.</v>

1369
00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:27.713
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chelsea manning has been exonerated or </v>

1370
00:52:29.850 --> 00:52:31.610
<v Speaker 3>what would have been pardoned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pardon?</v>

1371
00:52:31.710 --> 00:52:32.543
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that the word wasn't a partner when </v>

1372
00:52:34.071 --> 00:52:35.620
<v Speaker 3>you did commuter to sentence commuted </v>
<v Speaker 3>the sentence.</v>

1373
00:52:35.630 --> 00:52:37.430
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the commute the sentence,</v>

1374
00:52:37.431 --> 00:52:41.270
<v Speaker 3>and she's allowed to be free in May,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so in a couple months she'll be free,</v>

1375
00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:46.600
<v Speaker 3>but he's stuck in Russia and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially the difference being,</v>

1376
00:52:46.671 --> 00:52:47.504
<v Speaker 3>they said that Chelsea manning went to </v>
<v Speaker 3>like went through the court system was </v>

1377
00:52:53.151 --> 00:52:58.151
<v Speaker 3>tried and then Obama decided that it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>a good enough amount of time and then he</v>

1378
00:52:59.271 --> 00:53:00.440
<v Speaker 3>was going to commute the sentence.</v>

1379
00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:01.783
<v Speaker 3>So I kind of see their point there that </v>
<v Speaker 3>Edward snowden fleed and didn't go </v>

1380
00:53:05.931 --> 00:53:08.090
<v Speaker 3>through the whole but.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But why wouldn't he flee?</v>

1381
00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:09.560
<v Speaker 3>You're going to lock them in a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>cage.</v>

1382
00:53:09.590 --> 00:53:13.700
<v Speaker 3>Chelsea manning was locked in a cage 24 </v>
<v Speaker 3>hours a day with the lights on,</v>

1383
00:53:13.701 --> 00:53:16.940
<v Speaker 3>with no fucking clothes in solitary </v>
<v Speaker 3>confinement.</v>

1384
00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:19.250
<v Speaker 3>Confinement for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how long,</v>

1385
00:53:19.251 --> 00:53:21.770
<v Speaker 3>but it was a long period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to say years,</v>

1386
00:53:22.250 --> 00:53:26.550
<v Speaker 3>I want to say how long was find out?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How long was Chelsea manning in solitary</v>

1387
00:53:26.551 --> 00:53:28.770
<v Speaker 3>confinement for?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I know the way they did it,</v>

1388
00:53:28.771 --> 00:53:33.771
<v Speaker 3>it was cold in there and they took away </v>
<v Speaker 3>all her clothes or it was his clothes.</v>

1389
00:53:34.381 --> 00:53:35.670
<v Speaker 3>At the time was he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was he.</v>

1390
00:53:35.690 --> 00:53:36.523
<v Speaker 3>And when did you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When did you start saying him or her a </v>

1391
00:53:38.540 --> 00:53:39.310
<v Speaker 3>deal with that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1392
00:53:39.310 --> 00:53:40.143
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think at the All Africa point when </v>

1393
00:53:41.281 --> 00:53:43.320
<v Speaker 3>you're thinking back on the person </v>
<v Speaker 3>before they transitioned,</v>

1394
00:53:43.380 --> 00:53:45.360
<v Speaker 3>like do you say that Bruce Jenner won </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Olympics,</v>

1395
00:53:45.361 --> 00:53:46.900
<v Speaker 3>so do you say the Caitlyn Jenner won the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Olympics?</v>

1396
00:53:46.990 --> 00:53:47.823
<v Speaker 3>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know another way to say the </v>

1397
00:53:48.871 --> 00:53:49.920
<v Speaker 3>wrong thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1398
00:53:49.921 --> 00:53:50.754
<v Speaker 3>The former army analysts with two weeks </v>
<v Speaker 3>of solitary confinement connection with </v>

1399
00:53:53.431 --> 00:53:54.710
<v Speaker 3>the suicide attempt in July.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1400
00:53:54.711 --> 00:53:55.140
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1401
00:53:55.140 --> 00:54:00.140
<v Speaker 3>That's just one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The declined to discipline them with two</v>

1402
00:54:00.301 --> 00:54:02.910
<v Speaker 3>weeks now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she's been in solitary confinement,</v>

1403
00:54:02.911 --> 00:54:04.910
<v Speaker 3>not just over the suicide attempt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is.</v>

1404
00:54:04.911 --> 00:54:08.580
<v Speaker 3>This is like way late.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's 2016 go.</v>

1405
00:54:08.581 --> 00:54:09.414
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not the solitary confinement after </v>

1406
00:54:11.461 --> 00:54:12.294
<v Speaker 3>suicide attempt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just go to solitary confinement and </v>

1407
00:54:15.211 --> 00:54:16.044
<v Speaker 3>don't look at Chelsea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at Bradley manning solitary </v>

1408
00:54:19.231 --> 00:54:20.820
<v Speaker 3>confinement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was before he was tried.</v>

1409
00:54:20.850 --> 00:54:21.683
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like you could say he say he can </v>

1410
00:54:23.881 --> 00:54:25.080
<v Speaker 3>you get yelled at?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet you could.</v>

1411
00:54:25.370 --> 00:54:26.203
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you will for say he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's reasonable to say </v>

1412
00:54:28.291 --> 00:54:31.140
<v Speaker 3>before the transition when you went back</v>
<v Speaker 3>and posterity on on a person.</v>

1413
00:54:31.141 --> 00:54:31.974
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's up to that person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I would assume that the Pronoun </v>

1414
00:54:34.291 --> 00:54:36.060
<v Speaker 3>would change at that point.</v>

1415
00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:38.310
<v Speaker 3>Give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's ridiculous.</v>

1416
00:54:38.370 --> 00:54:39.690
<v Speaker 3>Confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so stupid.</v>

1417
00:54:39.710 --> 00:54:41.350
<v Speaker 3>There was a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a case of A.</v>

1418
00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:45.960
<v Speaker 3>I'm a transgender fighter who was a man </v>
<v Speaker 3>for 30 years.</v>

1419
00:54:45.961 --> 00:54:46.794
<v Speaker 3>Became a woman for two years and started</v>
<v Speaker 3>beating the fuck out of these women and </v>

1420
00:54:49.530 --> 00:54:50.730
<v Speaker 3>didn't tell them by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1421
00:54:50.731 --> 00:54:52.620
<v Speaker 3>so they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the organizers or whatever it didn't.</v>

1422
00:54:52.850 --> 00:54:53.683
<v Speaker 3>He didn't tell us she whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't tell the people that she was </v>

1423
00:54:57.301 --> 00:54:59.100
<v Speaker 3>fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but here's the best part about it.</v>

1424
00:54:59.101 --> 00:55:04.101
<v Speaker 3>I was debating with someone online and </v>
<v Speaker 3>this woman said that she's always been a</v>

1425
00:55:05.191 --> 00:55:06.024
<v Speaker 3>woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that this person has always been a </v>

1426
00:55:07.021 --> 00:55:07.771
<v Speaker 3>woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

1427
00:55:07.771 --> 00:55:09.840
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you realize that this person fathered</v>

1428
00:55:09.841 --> 00:55:11.160
<v Speaker 3>a child?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

1429
00:55:11.161 --> 00:55:15.390
<v Speaker 3>so even when he was a man having sex </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a woman and got her pregnant,</v>

1430
00:55:16.030 --> 00:55:18.330
<v Speaker 3>he was a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a woman then and this woman goes,</v>

1431
00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:19.590
<v Speaker 3>even then I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1432
00:55:19.591 --> 00:55:20.250
<v Speaker 3>we're done.</v>

1433
00:55:20.250 --> 00:55:22.080
<v Speaker 3>We'll fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't make sense.</v>

1434
00:55:22.590 --> 00:55:26.940
<v Speaker 3>I owe 23 hours a day for over an 11 </v>
<v Speaker 3>month period.</v>

1435
00:55:26.941 --> 00:55:31.630
<v Speaker 3>Shit and conditions that he also found </v>
<v Speaker 3>might have constituted tortured,</v>

1436
00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:36.210
<v Speaker 3>tortured Juan Mendez has completed a 14 </v>
<v Speaker 3>month investigation and the treatment of</v>

1437
00:55:36.211 --> 00:55:39.660
<v Speaker 3>manning since the soldiers arrested US </v>
<v Speaker 3>military base in May of 2010.</v>

1438
00:55:39.870 --> 00:55:40.703
<v Speaker 3>He concludes the US military was at </v>
<v Speaker 3>least culpable of cruel and inhumane </v>

1439
00:55:43.411 --> 00:55:44.244
<v Speaker 3>treatment and keeping manning locked up </v>
<v Speaker 3>alone for 23 hours a day for an over an </v>

1440
00:55:49.530 --> 00:55:51.480
<v Speaker 3>11 month period in conditions that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>found.</v>

1441
00:55:51.481 --> 00:55:52.560
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

1442
00:55:52.561 --> 00:55:53.790
<v Speaker 3>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was what it was.</v>

1443
00:55:53.791 --> 00:55:54.624
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was almost a year of solitary </v>

1444
00:55:56.491 --> 00:56:01.491
<v Speaker 3>confinement and I'm pretty sure that he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the time she now was naked and um,</v>

1445
00:56:02.730 --> 00:56:05.250
<v Speaker 3>they took everything away from him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No books,</v>

1446
00:56:05.251 --> 00:56:07.850
<v Speaker 3>no nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's really nothing to read.</v>

1447
00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:08.713
<v Speaker 3>Nothing cold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They keep it cold to keep it cold where </v>

1448
00:56:10.291 --> 00:56:12.180
<v Speaker 3>you're like barely able to tolerate it.</v>

1449
00:56:12.210 --> 00:56:13.140
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you do?</v>

1450
00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:14.340
<v Speaker 3>Like what is your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is your,</v>

1451
00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:17.490
<v Speaker 3>what are the places your mind goes?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would start doing Kung Fu.</v>

1452
00:56:17.820 --> 00:56:18.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll just start.</v>

1453
00:56:18.870 --> 00:56:19.703
<v Speaker 3>Just start working on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like Wesley Snipes in that one </v>

1454
00:56:23.741 --> 00:56:28.060
<v Speaker 3>movie where they kept him locked up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think stripped naked at night.</v>

1455
00:56:28.510 --> 00:56:31.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that,</v>

1456
00:56:31.151 --> 00:56:32.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

1457
00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:34.420
<v Speaker 3>what they did was what they are allowed </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do.</v>

1458
00:56:34.570 --> 00:56:35.403
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're allowed to do whatever you want </v>

1459
00:56:36.091 --> 00:56:38.080
<v Speaker 3>to do when you get someone locked up </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

1460
00:56:38.081 --> 00:56:40.600
<v Speaker 3>They don't really have the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>rights that are around an average person</v>

1461
00:56:40.601 --> 00:56:41.434
<v Speaker 3>does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get locked up for treason and there </v>

1462
00:56:43.721 --> 00:56:44.554
<v Speaker 3>was a tremendous amount of heat coming </v>
<v Speaker 3>towards the US military when that wiki </v>

1463
00:56:47.681 --> 00:56:49.390
<v Speaker 3>leaks video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1464
00:56:49.580 --> 00:56:50.320
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was the,</v>

1465
00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:52.120
<v Speaker 3>what was it called?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did they call it?</v>

1466
00:56:52.150 --> 00:56:55.110
<v Speaker 3>Something about collateral murder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that was what they call it.</v>

1467
00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:55.953
<v Speaker 3>Was it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was it,</v>

1468
00:56:56.140 --> 00:56:57.360
<v Speaker 3>was it drones or was it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1469
00:56:57.400 --> 00:57:00.130
<v Speaker 3>it was a helicopter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1470
00:57:00.131 --> 00:57:00.611
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1471
00:57:00.611 --> 00:57:01.420
<v Speaker 3>I know you talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

1472
00:57:01.420 --> 00:57:02.253
<v Speaker 3>Helicopter shooting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking horrific gunfire down on these </v>

1473
00:57:05.861 --> 00:57:07.570
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That turned out to be reporters.</v>

1474
00:57:07.780 --> 00:57:11.530
<v Speaker 3>And then the callous attitude that these</v>
<v Speaker 3>soldiers showed in the video,</v>

1475
00:57:11.531 --> 00:57:14.230
<v Speaker 3>we can hear them talking about whether </v>
<v Speaker 3>or not there are kids in the van.</v>

1476
00:57:14.231 --> 00:57:15.280
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they shouldn't have brought kids.</v>

1477
00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:16.473
<v Speaker 3>Like the whole thing was like really </v>
<v Speaker 3>dark and I think in a lot of ways </v>

1478
00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:22.113
<v Speaker 3>exposure to that stuff is good because </v>
<v Speaker 3>unchecked behavior is extremely </v>

1479
00:57:26.231 --> 00:57:29.110
<v Speaker 3>dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That seemed like it was unchecked and it</v>

1480
00:57:29.111 --> 00:57:33.490
<v Speaker 3>seemed like unchecked behavior in a time</v>
<v Speaker 3>of war is extremely dangerous and it was</v>

1481
00:57:33.610 --> 00:57:37.570
<v Speaker 3>pretty obvious that when you looked at </v>
<v Speaker 3>what at Edward Snowden had revealed,</v>

1482
00:57:37.571 --> 00:57:38.404
<v Speaker 3>it was pretty obvious that the majority </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the American people had a huge </v>

1483
00:57:41.741 --> 00:57:43.780
<v Speaker 3>problem with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The majority of the American people,</v>

1484
00:57:43.781 --> 00:57:46.930
<v Speaker 3>you or I who are doing nothing wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not committing any crimes.</v>

1485
00:57:47.110 --> 00:57:49.300
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm certainly not victimizing anybody.</v>

1486
00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:52.040
<v Speaker 3>Why do they have access to my email?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

1487
00:57:52.630 --> 00:57:54.640
<v Speaker 3>There's no reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no reason.</v>

1488
00:57:54.641 --> 00:57:55.474
<v Speaker 3>You just can like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That seems insane and that to me is a </v>

1489
00:57:59.051 --> 00:58:01.360
<v Speaker 3>way clear violation of the fourth </v>
<v Speaker 3>amendment.</v>

1490
00:58:01.660 --> 00:58:02.493
<v Speaker 3>Then this weird sort of gray area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not necessarily great if you're looking </v>

1491
00:58:05.891 --> 00:58:09.910
<v Speaker 3>at it from a constitutional sense of how</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're allowed to check you out.</v>

1492
00:58:10.300 --> 00:58:10.591
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1493
00:58:10.591 --> 00:58:12.290
<v Speaker 2>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a very valid and solid argument.</v>

1494
00:58:12.291 --> 00:58:13.124
<v Speaker 2>I think because my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my stance on manning specifically as </v>

1495
00:58:15.821 --> 00:58:17.960
<v Speaker 2>soften,</v>
<v Speaker 2>soften overtime because I feel like,</v>

1496
00:58:18.270 --> 00:58:19.700
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1497
00:58:19.701 --> 00:58:23.960
<v Speaker 2>when he or she can we call her Z,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Z.</v>

1498
00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:25.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm not trying to be disrespectful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't know.</v>

1499
00:58:25.461 --> 00:58:26.700
<v Speaker 2>What else was he in?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Disrespectful.</v>

1500
00:58:26.710 --> 00:58:28.370
<v Speaker 2>You fucking son of a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

1501
00:58:28.380 --> 00:58:29.530
<v Speaker 2>Racist too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

1502
00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:30.433
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what that Lexis nexis will call </v>

1503
00:58:31.291 --> 00:58:33.120
<v Speaker 2>me a racist for the rest of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1504
00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:34.520
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1505
00:58:34.521 --> 00:58:36.390
<v Speaker 2>To me it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt like it was,</v>

1506
00:58:36.420 --> 00:58:39.510
<v Speaker 2>it was very.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't take the time to,</v>

1507
00:58:39.590 --> 00:58:41.550
<v Speaker 2>to people died because of that stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>like there,</v>

1508
00:58:41.580 --> 00:58:43.880
<v Speaker 2>there are people that were put in danger</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of the things that they were put</v>

1509
00:58:43.881 --> 00:58:44.714
<v Speaker 2>out because it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't carefully comb through it </v>

1510
00:58:46.071 --> 00:58:48.040
<v Speaker 2>and make sure that he's actually done.</v>

1511
00:58:48.040 --> 00:58:48.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1512
00:58:48.430 --> 00:58:50.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean you could look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that they look that,</v>

1513
00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:51.313
<v Speaker 2>look that up and say it's because of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way wikileaks released it yet because I </v>

1514
00:58:54.471 --> 00:58:55.304
<v Speaker 2>don't think that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if they're going to point </v>

1515
00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:56.710
<v Speaker 2>that specific things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

1516
00:58:56.890 --> 00:58:59.060
<v Speaker 2>the way things were out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I don't think all of the names were</v>

1517
00:58:59.061 --> 00:58:59.894
<v Speaker 2>blacked out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think like the operate the </v>

1518
00:59:00.411 --> 00:59:02.330
<v Speaker 2>operations and process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people were in play,</v>

1519
00:59:02.390 --> 00:59:04.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we're being out at in that way.</v>

1520
00:59:04.520 --> 00:59:05.353
<v Speaker 2>I think the reason I was a little softer</v>
<v Speaker 2>on snowden was because not only was it </v>

1521
00:59:07.311 --> 00:59:08.144
<v Speaker 2>domestic primarily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but which I think is an important </v>

1522
00:59:10.910 --> 00:59:11.743
<v Speaker 2>qualifier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also because I think he went out of </v>

1523
00:59:13.521 --> 00:59:15.890
<v Speaker 2>his way to not single any individuals </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

1524
00:59:15.891 --> 00:59:19.720
<v Speaker 2>It was all about the apparatus itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't about like saying like General</v>

1525
00:59:19.721 --> 00:59:22.250
<v Speaker 2>Blah Blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah is doing this general or admiral,</v>

1526
00:59:22.260 --> 00:59:23.480
<v Speaker 1>but it was about like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1527
00:59:23.481 --> 00:59:27.830
<v Speaker 1>this structure exists and it's really as</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite nefarious indeed.</v>

1528
00:59:27.860 --> 00:59:28.850
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that.</v>

1529
00:59:29.210 --> 00:59:30.043
<v Speaker 1>So I was always to me my stance on him </v>
<v Speaker 1>as he's a patriot and you should be </v>

1530
00:59:31.731 --> 00:59:33.530
<v Speaker 1>welcomed home and the fact that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't.</v>

1531
00:59:34.070 --> 00:59:34.903
<v Speaker 1>He can't be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess party hasn't been tried or </v>

1532
00:59:35.781 --> 00:59:36.614
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the fact that I know that some </v>

1533
00:59:37.731 --> 00:59:38.564
<v Speaker 1>people think that Obama only pardoned </v>
<v Speaker 1>manning because it made him look good </v>

1534
00:59:42.111 --> 00:59:45.860
<v Speaker 1>with the transgender community and with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Lbgtq community,</v>

1535
00:59:46.220 --> 00:59:49.130
<v Speaker 1>which I think is a little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There might be a living office though.</v>

1536
00:59:49.230 --> 00:59:50.450
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's part of his legacy.</v>

1537
00:59:50.451 --> 00:59:51.500
<v Speaker 1>Like it's part of what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1538
00:59:51.501 --> 00:59:52.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the same reason why you know,</v>

1539
00:59:52.970 --> 00:59:56.390
<v Speaker 1>how much Ford was hurt when he pardoned </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nixon that stuck with them forever and a</v>

1540
00:59:56.391 --> 00:59:56.991
<v Speaker 1>negative way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1541
00:59:56.991 --> 00:59:57.824
<v Speaker 1>this is going to stick with Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think positively in a good way of </v>

1542
01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:01.753
<v Speaker 1>moving forward.</v>

1543
01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:03.230
<v Speaker 1>But I don't know that I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

1544
01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:05.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm quite that callous and thinking that</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the only reason.</v>

1545
01:00:05.451 --> 01:00:07.550
<v Speaker 1>I think that he probably had time to </v>
<v Speaker 1>marinate on it.</v>

1546
01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:11.030
<v Speaker 1>Clearly she went through some rigorous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1547
01:00:11.031 --> 01:00:14.720
<v Speaker 1>also what's important to point out is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that Obama's website,</v>

1548
01:00:14.721 --> 01:00:15.554
<v Speaker 1>the hope and change website that he had </v>
<v Speaker 1>when he was running for president and </v>

1549
01:00:18.321 --> 01:00:21.500
<v Speaker 1>when he got into office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the original website had in it,</v>

1550
01:00:21.770 --> 01:00:24.560
<v Speaker 1>these provisions for how he was going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>treat whistleblowers with,</v>

1551
01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:25.810
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1552
01:00:25.810 --> 01:00:26.643
<v Speaker 1>they were gonna allow people to release </v>
<v Speaker 1>information that showed crimes and they </v>

1553
01:00:30.921 --> 01:00:32.990
<v Speaker 1>were going to protect them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to protect whistleblowers.</v>

1554
01:00:32.991 --> 01:00:33.824
<v Speaker 1>It was a very specific statement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a very specific approach that they </v>

1555
01:00:38.451 --> 01:00:39.284
<v Speaker 1>were having while he was running for </v>
<v Speaker 1>president about whistleblowers because </v>

1556
01:00:41.811 --> 01:00:45.690
<v Speaker 1>he was about exposing these agregious </v>
<v Speaker 1>offenses and when,</v>

1557
01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:46.633
<v Speaker 1>once he got into office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that happened after </v>

1558
01:00:48.411 --> 01:00:52.250
<v Speaker 1>the Chelsea manning thing and after the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Edward Snowden things,</v>

1559
01:00:52.251 --> 01:00:54.620
<v Speaker 1>they removed that from the hope and </v>
<v Speaker 1>change website.</v>

1560
01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:56.560
<v Speaker 1>The removed that provision about </v>
<v Speaker 1>whistleblowers.</v>

1561
01:00:56.570 --> 01:00:57.740
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's obviously,</v>

1562
01:00:57.741 --> 01:00:59.930
<v Speaker 1>it was obviously it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was unable.</v>

1563
01:01:00.110 --> 01:01:02.290
<v Speaker 1>He's either a hypocrite or is unable to </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep that promise.</v>

1564
01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:03.153
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1565
01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:04.400
<v Speaker 1>that goes back to the whole thing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>snowden.</v>

1566
01:01:04.430 --> 01:01:07.370
<v Speaker 1>When you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you kind of take an oath to protect</v>

1567
01:01:07.371 --> 01:01:08.720
<v Speaker 1>these secrets and all that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

1568
01:01:08.721 --> 01:01:10.440
<v Speaker 1>but I look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1569
01:01:10.610 --> 01:01:12.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't want people to be flippant with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of stuff that you were saying.</v>

1570
01:01:12.531 --> 01:01:13.730
<v Speaker 1>I want people to be flippantly being </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1571
01:01:13.731 --> 01:01:14.564
<v Speaker 1>well this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have some sort of personal problem </v>

1572
01:01:15.321 --> 01:01:16.730
<v Speaker 1>with this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I actually think it takes a level of</v>

1573
01:01:16.731 --> 01:01:19.310
<v Speaker 1>courage to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what in the fuck is going on here?</v>

1574
01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:20.001
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

1575
01:01:20.001 --> 01:01:23.420
<v Speaker 1>And also I believe that before he gave </v>
<v Speaker 1>that information to Glenn Greenwald,</v>

1576
01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:24.583
<v Speaker 1>I believe he offered it to a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different mainstream news sources like </v>

1577
01:01:27.890 --> 01:01:29.660
<v Speaker 1>New York Times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington Post.</v>

1578
01:01:29.710 --> 01:01:31.340
<v Speaker 1>I've correct me if I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

1579
01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:32.570
<v Speaker 1>I think that was in the documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1580
01:01:32.571 --> 01:01:36.420
<v Speaker 1>the um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see it or something like that.</v>

1581
01:01:36.450 --> 01:01:38.870
<v Speaker 1>You fell asleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tried to watch it in a hotel room.</v>

1582
01:01:39.950 --> 01:01:40.783
<v Speaker 1>What's up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just say which one do you want me to </v>

1583
01:01:41.301 --> 01:01:42.680
<v Speaker 1>look up because I got the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a no,</v>

1584
01:01:42.980 --> 01:01:46.640
<v Speaker 1>no one died as a result of which one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which one?</v>

1585
01:01:46.670 --> 01:01:49.990
<v Speaker 1>The one earlier about Chelsea manning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie does it.</v>

1586
01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:50.853
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't say anything about that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember that being contentious that </v>

1587
01:01:52.521 --> 01:01:53.354
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were saying the reason that they </v>

1588
01:01:53.691 --> 01:01:54.800
<v Speaker 1>were upset about it was because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were like,</v>

1589
01:01:54.801 --> 01:01:56.570
<v Speaker 1>this puts people that are in play in </v>
<v Speaker 1>danger.</v>

1590
01:01:56.571 --> 01:01:59.040
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that maybe that may be dangerous,</v>

1591
01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:01.280
<v Speaker 1>but maybe no one actually does good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The writer had a,</v>

1592
01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:02.193
<v Speaker 1>a usa today piece,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think about it and she got a lot of </v>

1593
01:02:04.011 --> 01:02:04.844
<v Speaker 1>heat for pope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for even writing that up in the first </v>

1594
01:02:07.371 --> 01:02:08.204
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That puts people in danger that people </v>

1595
01:02:09.051 --> 01:02:11.880
<v Speaker 1>died from the result of his leaks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1596
01:02:11.881 --> 01:02:13.520
<v Speaker 1>So she got a lot of heat because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't.</v>

1597
01:02:13.580 --> 01:02:15.230
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interest is probably what it is.</v>

1598
01:02:15.231 --> 01:02:16.640
<v Speaker 1>You probably read that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1599
01:02:17.030 --> 01:02:18.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People again,</v>

1600
01:02:18.410 --> 01:02:19.890
<v Speaker 1>you're a racist and</v>

1601
01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:22.100
<v Speaker 3>people have died.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean Google says it but,</v>

1602
01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:23.240
<v Speaker 3>but you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean like,</v>

1603
01:02:23.250 --> 01:02:24.083
<v Speaker 3>people need clickbait.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So with her writing an article saying </v>

1604
01:02:26.911 --> 01:02:28.650
<v Speaker 3>that bunch of people died or someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>died.</v>

1605
01:02:29.070 --> 01:02:29.903
<v Speaker 3>It's this kind of the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to make something jucier </v>

1606
01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:33.473
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd go and even with the London </v>

1607
01:02:34.261 --> 01:02:35.490
<v Speaker 3>terrorist attack,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1608
01:02:35.550 --> 01:02:36.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>recent one.</v>

1609
01:02:36.540 --> 01:02:37.373
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The one that just happened where people </v>

1610
01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:40.290
<v Speaker 3>they've seen too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've identified the person,</v>

1611
01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:43.740
<v Speaker 3>get new sources that were that what you </v>
<v Speaker 3>think are reputable,</v>

1612
01:02:43.741 --> 01:02:45.270
<v Speaker 3>say it and then they have to retract it </v>
<v Speaker 3>later.</v>

1613
01:02:45.271 --> 01:02:47.710
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's very quick to try to pull the</v>

1614
01:02:47.730 --> 01:02:48.870
<v Speaker 3>pull the gun first and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1615
01:02:48.871 --> 01:02:50.040
<v Speaker 3>we have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have the story.</v>

1616
01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:51.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're all victimized.</v>

1617
01:02:51.990 --> 01:02:53.370
<v Speaker 3>As you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that are just,</v>

1618
01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:54.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not in the trenches,</v>

1619
01:02:54.421 --> 01:02:55.254
<v Speaker 3>so we need the information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have to trust these people and trust </v>

1620
01:02:57.121 --> 01:02:57.540
<v Speaker 3>is broken.</v>

1621
01:02:57.540 --> 01:02:58.373
<v Speaker 3>I think in a Lola and I certainly think </v>
<v Speaker 3>there should be some sort of a national </v>

1622
01:03:01.501 --> 01:03:04.890
<v Speaker 3>debate on whether or not Edward Snowden </v>
<v Speaker 3>is a hero.</v>

1623
01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:06.113
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether or not Edward Snowden did </v>

1624
01:03:07.291 --> 01:03:08.124
<v Speaker 3>something that benefited the American </v>
<v Speaker 3>people because I certainly think the </v>

1625
01:03:10.831 --> 01:03:14.130
<v Speaker 3>overall reaction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the overall,</v>

1626
01:03:14.131 --> 01:03:14.964
<v Speaker 3>like if you look at what Edward Snowden </v>
<v Speaker 3>did and then you look at what are the </v>

1627
01:03:17.221 --> 01:03:18.054
<v Speaker 3>consequences of what he did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's good for us because we got </v>

1628
01:03:21.001 --> 01:03:21.834
<v Speaker 3>to see that all these Alex Jones type </v>
<v Speaker 3>conspiracies were actually true when </v>

1629
01:03:25.891 --> 01:03:28.770
<v Speaker 3>Alex Jones is ranting and raving about </v>
<v Speaker 3>the government living in your emails.</v>

1630
01:03:28.890 --> 01:03:30.420
<v Speaker 3>One of the great episodes of the show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

1631
01:03:30.421 --> 01:03:31.254
<v Speaker 3>I love it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but people were looking into that like </v>

1632
01:03:32.311 --> 01:03:33.144
<v Speaker 3>there's no fucking way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no way that government really </v>

1633
01:03:34.501 --> 01:03:36.450
<v Speaker 3>looks into your email.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no way it doesn't happen,</v>

1634
01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:38.280
<v Speaker 3>but yes they do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that was.</v>

1635
01:03:38.430 --> 01:03:39.263
<v Speaker 3>That was a stunner to me and this for me</v>
<v Speaker 3>was I'd been telling people that Alex </v>

1636
01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:45.113
<v Speaker 3>Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's my friend and has been my friend </v>

1637
01:03:45.781 --> 01:03:49.980
<v Speaker 3>for a long time and I get criticized so </v>
<v Speaker 3>much by people that they're like,</v>

1638
01:03:49.981 --> 01:03:52.820
<v Speaker 3>he's so crazy and he's such a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>right wing Wacko.</v>

1639
01:03:52.821 --> 01:03:54.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alex Jones is not right wing.</v>

1640
01:03:54.750 --> 01:03:56.970
<v Speaker 3>He's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's antigovernment.</v>

1641
01:03:57.090 --> 01:03:57.923
<v Speaker 3>He's anti tyranny and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he might be crazy as fuck and he </v>

1642
01:04:00.091 --> 01:04:00.924
<v Speaker 3>probably is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's right about a lot of shit and </v>

1643
01:04:03.181 --> 01:04:04.940
<v Speaker 3>that's where it gets really scary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's.</v>

1644
01:04:04.941 --> 01:04:05.774
<v Speaker 3>He was talking about the NSA,</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking into people's emails and having </v>

1645
01:04:07.771 --> 01:04:08.604
<v Speaker 3>the ability to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I found out about that NSA </v>

1646
01:04:11.731 --> 01:04:13.320
<v Speaker 3>whistleblower,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the original one.</v>

1647
01:04:13.321 --> 01:04:16.830
<v Speaker 3>See if you could find who that guy is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to say yes,</v>

1648
01:04:16.890 --> 01:04:17.641
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pull it,</v>

1649
01:04:17.641 --> 01:04:18.810
<v Speaker 3>pull it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pull up that article.</v>

1650
01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:20.310
<v Speaker 3>I found out about that from Alex.</v>

1651
01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:21.420
<v Speaker 3>he told me about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1652
01:04:21.421 --> 01:04:23.130
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I hear Bill Binney,</v>

1653
01:04:23.131 --> 01:04:27.030
<v Speaker 3>the original NSA whistleblower on in </v>
<v Speaker 3>nine slash 11 and illegal surveillance.</v>

1654
01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:28.680
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a god,</v>

1655
01:04:28.681 --> 01:04:30.510
<v Speaker 3>I want to say it was before nine slash </v>
<v Speaker 3>11,</v>

1656
01:04:30.780 --> 01:04:31.980
<v Speaker 3>wasn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Before nine slash 11.</v>

1657
01:04:31.981 --> 01:04:34.050
<v Speaker 3>Then he came out with this scroll down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1658
01:04:34.051 --> 01:04:34.884
<v Speaker 3>was it right after nine slash 11.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He believes that nine slash 11 was </v>

1659
01:04:36.871 --> 01:04:38.730
<v Speaker 3>preventable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A month after it happened.</v>

1660
01:04:38.970 --> 01:04:39.803
<v Speaker 3>He resigned in protest from the National</v>
<v Speaker 3>Security Agency bidding was part of an </v>

1661
01:04:42.751 --> 01:04:45.210
<v Speaker 3>elite NSA team that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>

1662
01:04:45.220 --> 01:04:46.053
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>designed and built an intelligence </v>

1663
01:04:48.091 --> 01:04:51.660
<v Speaker 3>gathering system to target and collect </v>
<v Speaker 3>data on terrorism threats.</v>

1664
01:04:51.870 --> 01:04:53.850
<v Speaker 3>He belongs to an intimate group of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

1665
01:04:54.030 --> 01:04:54.863
<v Speaker 3>for whistleblowers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>each of whom left the NSA after raising </v>

1666
01:04:57.961 --> 01:05:00.570
<v Speaker 3>concerns about failures and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>agencies.</v>

1667
01:05:00.571 --> 01:05:04.470
<v Speaker 3>Intelligence gathering capabilities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1668
01:05:04.471 --> 01:05:05.304
<v Speaker 3>So he's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was the first guy that was saying </v>

1669
01:05:07.141 --> 01:05:07.974
<v Speaker 3>what they're doing is bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he alleges the NSA buried key </v>

1670
01:05:11.491 --> 01:05:14.040
<v Speaker 3>intelligence that could have prevented </v>
<v Speaker 3>nine slash 11.</v>

1671
01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:18.130
<v Speaker 3>He alleges the agency's bulk data </v>
<v Speaker 3>collection from Internet and telephone</v>

1672
01:05:18.130 --> 01:05:21.620
<v Speaker 1>communications is unconstitutional and </v>
<v Speaker 1>illegal in the U.</v>

1673
01:05:21.621 --> 01:05:26.621
<v Speaker 1>s he alleges that the NSA is ineffective</v>
<v Speaker 1>at preventing terrorism because analysts</v>

1674
01:05:26.771 --> 01:05:29.380
<v Speaker 1>are too swamped with information on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>

1675
01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:34.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm under its bulk collection program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That totally makes sense.</v>

1676
01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:34.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're.</v>

1677
01:05:34.790 --> 01:05:35.800
<v Speaker 1>When you have everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you.</v>

1678
01:05:35.801 --> 01:05:36.810
<v Speaker 1>Where do you begin?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1679
01:05:36.940 --> 01:05:38.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean all those things that he's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1680
01:05:38.741 --> 01:05:40.090
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no way.</v>

1681
01:05:40.150 --> 01:05:42.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a friend of mine,</v>

1682
01:05:42.220 --> 01:05:44.250
<v Speaker 1>I was joking around about this because </v>
<v Speaker 1>managers,</v>

1683
01:05:44.290 --> 01:05:46.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm just not comfortable with the NSA </v>
<v Speaker 1>reading my email.</v>

1684
01:05:46.661 --> 01:05:47.950
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course you're not comfortable.</v>

1685
01:05:47.980 --> 01:05:49.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm not either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But guess what,</v>

1686
01:05:50.110 --> 01:05:52.900
<v Speaker 1>who's fucking reading your shit man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's reading your shit.</v>

1687
01:05:53.170 --> 01:05:55.210
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not even the point.</v>

1688
01:05:55.211 --> 01:05:56.070
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1689
01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:56.913
<v Speaker 1>it goes back to the point you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>making because with the Patriot Act </v>

1690
01:05:58.541 --> 01:06:00.130
<v Speaker 1>after 9:11,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they made the same argument.</v>

1691
01:06:00.131 --> 01:06:01.420
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have nothing to hide,</v>

1692
01:06:01.421 --> 01:06:01.570
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1693
01:06:01.570 --> 01:06:04.030
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is soon as something comes up,</v>

1694
01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:04.960
<v Speaker 1>like they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>

1695
01:06:04.970 --> 01:06:05.680
<v Speaker 1>this column,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moriarty,</v>

1696
01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:07.840
<v Speaker 1>he's been talking to a lot of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's find out what he's into,</v>

1697
01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:09.190
<v Speaker 1>but I'll look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A bunch of Dick Pics,</v>

1698

1701
01:06:13.050 --> 01:06:14.290

1703
01:06:14.861 --> 01:06:16.230
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I kind of,</v>

1704
01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:18.580
<v Speaker 1>I think we're in the lead with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think snowden is a hero.</v>

1705
01:06:18.910 --> 01:06:19.501
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1706
01:06:19.501 --> 01:06:21.790
<v Speaker 1>I feel like what he did took a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>courage.</v>

1707
01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:22.713
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1710
01:06:27.311 --> 01:06:29.770
<v Speaker 1>I might go to Russia for the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to meet that dude.</v>

1711
01:06:29.950 --> 01:06:31.540
<v Speaker 1>I'll let you interview him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He probably would talk to you.</v>

1712
01:06:31.570 --> 01:06:32.500
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to go to Russia?</v>

1713
01:06:35.370 --> 01:06:38.700
<v Speaker 1>Big Pause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll talk about data when I was younger</v>

1714
01:06:38.701 --> 01:06:41.020
<v Speaker 1>and I was trying to think of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to put an next by him.</v>

1715
01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:46.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to put you on the spot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if it was possible to meet that guy,</v>

1716
01:06:46.321 --> 01:06:47.154
<v Speaker 1>I would love to meet that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they just let you meet </v>

1717
01:06:48.481 --> 01:06:50.610
<v Speaker 1>them though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet it would be like really hard.</v>

1718
01:06:50.611 --> 01:06:52.950
<v Speaker 1>I know John Oliver met him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shane Smith did too.</v>

1719
01:06:53.070 --> 01:06:53.903
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1720
01:06:54.030 --> 01:06:55.460
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'd go with Shane.</v>

1721
01:06:56.370 --> 01:06:58.020
<v Speaker 1>Shane Hook it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would probably love to talk to you.</v>

1722
01:06:58.021 --> 01:06:58.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1723
01:06:58.790 --> 01:07:00.620
<v Speaker 1>he seems like an interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's probably caught on a contract,</v>

1724
01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:01.860
<v Speaker 1>constant surveillance you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>assume,</v>

1725
01:07:01.861 --> 01:07:04.710
<v Speaker 1>but I'm sure I would be fucked when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>came back.</v>

1726
01:07:04.711 --> 01:07:06.390
<v Speaker 1>They probably check everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1727
01:07:06.391 --> 01:07:07.224
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like to sit down with that guy </v>

1728
01:07:07.771 --> 01:07:10.440
<v Speaker 1>for a few hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a do like a six hour interview with</v>

1729
01:07:10.441 --> 01:07:13.140
<v Speaker 1>him and just pick them apart and ask </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1730
01:07:13.141 --> 01:07:14.540
<v Speaker 1>what is your life like now man?</v>

1731
01:07:14.550 --> 01:07:19.550
<v Speaker 1>Like how many brushing chicks you </v>
<v Speaker 1>banging your here over here pay you.</v>

1732
01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:21.900
<v Speaker 1>What do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you eat?</v>

1733
01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:24.660
<v Speaker 1>What do you do to feed yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like where's he getting these money?</v>

1734
01:07:24.690 --> 01:07:26.250
<v Speaker 1>He must got a stipend of some sort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to assume,</v>

1735
01:07:26.251 --> 01:07:27.750
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you have to.</v>

1736
01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:28.793
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's a guest of there so you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to assume that he's taken care of in </v>

1737
01:07:30.811 --> 01:07:31.531
<v Speaker 1>some way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1738
01:07:31.531 --> 01:07:34.650
<v Speaker 1>But I mean he probably has to keep his </v>
<v Speaker 1>value high,</v>

1739
01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:36.810
<v Speaker 1>like at a certain point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they,</v>

1740
01:07:36.980 --> 01:07:38.220
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could say hey,</v>

1741
01:07:38.221 --> 01:07:40.650
<v Speaker 1>you're not valuable to us anymore time </v>
<v Speaker 1>to live in Guatemala,</v>

1742
01:07:40.651 --> 01:07:42.050
<v Speaker 1>bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

1743
01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:43.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a very smart man,</v>

1744
01:07:43.261 --> 01:07:47.130
<v Speaker 1>so he must know at the highest level </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he is a geopolitical pawn that,</v>

1745
01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:49.710
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could be played in any way at any point.</v>

1746
01:07:49.711 --> 01:07:50.550
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was him.</v>

1747
01:07:50.551 --> 01:07:54.360
<v Speaker 1>I would just be listening to Rosetta </v>
<v Speaker 1>stone with Russia all day long.</v>

1748
01:07:54.390 --> 01:07:55.223
<v Speaker 1>I'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to find out how to speak Russian </v>

1749
01:07:57.240 --> 01:08:01.770
<v Speaker 1>and I need to fucking go hide in Siberia</v>
<v Speaker 1>or something and to grow my beard out.</v>

1750
01:08:02.730 --> 01:08:03.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

1751
01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:04.830
<v Speaker 1>he's an interesting cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>

1752
01:08:04.831 --> 01:08:05.431
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1753
01:08:05.431 --> 01:08:07.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm somewhat fascinated by him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we've,</v>

1754
01:08:07.770 --> 01:08:08.603
<v Speaker 1>I think you'll come back at some point </v>
<v Speaker 1>that Neil degrasse Tyson had a </v>

1755
01:08:10.301 --> 01:08:11.134
<v Speaker 1>fascinating interview with him on </v>
<v Speaker 1>startalk radio where I was in Neil </v>

1756
01:08:14.041 --> 01:08:15.800
<v Speaker 1>degrasse Tyson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Essentially we're the same thing that he</v>

1757
01:08:15.801 --> 01:08:17.240
<v Speaker 1>thinks he's a patriot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1758
01:08:17.241 --> 01:08:18.074
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neil doesn't really take too many </v>

1759
01:08:18.561 --> 01:08:21.680
<v Speaker 1>stances like that are really political </v>
<v Speaker 1>in that regard.</v>

1760
01:08:21.681 --> 01:08:22.514
<v Speaker 1>But I think as far as like data </v>
<v Speaker 1>collection or random of just a blanket </v>

1761
01:08:27.741 --> 01:08:29.780
<v Speaker 1>data collection of all the people in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>United States,</v>

1762
01:08:29.781 --> 01:08:34.460
<v Speaker 1>I think it's fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's absolutely not what we think of</v>

1763
01:08:34.461 --> 01:08:35.294
<v Speaker 1>when we think of the freedom that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States supposedly provides its </v>

1764
01:08:38.691 --> 01:08:39.524
<v Speaker 1>citizens.</v>

1765
01:08:39.610 --> 01:08:43.730
<v Speaker 1>It seems like we're all under suspicion </v>
<v Speaker 1>then we're all being under surveillance.</v>

1766
01:08:43.970 --> 01:08:47.420
<v Speaker 1>That's some really creepy orwell type </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>

1767
01:08:47.870 --> 01:08:49.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just not what we want.</v>

1768
01:08:49.970 --> 01:08:51.470
<v Speaker 1>It's extremely Orwellian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

1769
01:08:51.740 --> 01:08:53.170
<v Speaker 1>it goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like with Snowden,</v>

1770
01:08:53.180 --> 01:08:54.980
<v Speaker 1>sometimes people miss the forest for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>trees with it.</v>

1771
01:08:54.981 --> 01:08:57.260
<v Speaker 1>They're very focused on the man in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>act,</v>

1772
01:08:57.530 --> 01:08:59.070
<v Speaker 1>but they're not focused on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1773
01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:00.620
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I'm really </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in is like,</v>

1774
01:09:00.621 --> 01:09:01.770
<v Speaker 1>what is the complicity?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1775
01:09:01.771 --> 01:09:03.530
<v Speaker 1>what is the level of complicity with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>telecoms?</v>

1776
01:09:03.531 --> 01:09:04.364
<v Speaker 1>Like what is the complicity with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government like forcing these people </v>

1777
01:09:05.991 --> 01:09:06.281
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1778
01:09:06.281 --> 01:09:09.740
<v Speaker 1>and there's a whole and how many </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of people are in on this?</v>

1779
01:09:09.741 --> 01:09:11.750
<v Speaker 1>And that's the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the crazy thing is that snowden,</v>

1780
01:09:12.020 --> 01:09:12.853
<v Speaker 1>who was a contractor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not even really in the inner sanctum of </v>

1781
01:09:15.621 --> 01:09:17.480
<v Speaker 1>the NSA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knew all of this stuff.</v>

1782
01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:18.553
<v Speaker 1>There are people running around </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of people just acting like </v>

1783
01:09:19.821 --> 01:09:21.170
<v Speaker 1>this never happened or wasn't going on.</v>

1784
01:09:21.180 --> 01:09:22.013
<v Speaker 1>So it's a pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a conspiracy because we know </v>

1785
01:09:23.091 --> 01:09:23.924
<v Speaker 1>it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a pretty big thing where I'm </v>

1786
01:09:24.711 --> 01:09:27.560
<v Speaker 1>like focusing on Snowden is missing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire point.</v>

1787
01:09:27.561 --> 01:09:28.394
<v Speaker 1>There's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are all like why didn't no one like </v>

1788
01:09:31.461 --> 01:09:33.110
<v Speaker 1>no sprint or t mobile?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyone was like,</v>

1789
01:09:33.111 --> 01:09:33.944
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you imagine the kind of cool would </v>

1790
01:09:34.781 --> 01:09:37.460
<v Speaker 1>have been for one of those companies </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be like we're not doing this.</v>

1791
01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:38.960
<v Speaker 1>And in fact like we're going to tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone,</v>

1792
01:09:39.700 --> 01:09:40.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1793
01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:42.230
<v Speaker 1>what will this will make us look </v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing,</v>

1794
01:09:42.330 --> 01:09:43.163
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a very shrewd corporate stance and </v>

1795
01:09:44.431 --> 01:09:46.210
<v Speaker 1>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we don't grow.</v>

1796
01:09:46.650 --> 01:09:48.650
<v Speaker 1>Let's be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would never happen.</v>

1797
01:09:48.651 --> 01:09:51.890
<v Speaker 1>And if it did happen they would come </v>
<v Speaker 1>down on that company so hard.</v>

1798
01:09:51.891 --> 01:09:52.724
<v Speaker 1>There has to be some weird sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>arrangements of these gigantic </v>

1799
01:09:55.941 --> 01:09:56.774
<v Speaker 1>telecommunication companies like verizon</v>
<v Speaker 1>or something has with the federal </v>

1800
01:09:59.271 --> 01:10:00.710
<v Speaker 1>government and we just has to be.</v>

1801
01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:01.873
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just protecting the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm sure that there's something </v>

1802
01:10:03.441 --> 01:10:04.274
<v Speaker 1>they can do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't care about anything but </v>

1803
01:10:04.821 --> 01:10:05.654
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I have a friend who used to be a big </v>

1804
01:10:07.281 --> 01:10:08.114
<v Speaker 1>executive at Google and she described to</v>
<v Speaker 1>me some of the conversations that they </v>

1805
01:10:10.671 --> 01:10:11.504
<v Speaker 1>had when they were dealing with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government and search engines and being </v>

1806
01:10:15.681 --> 01:10:18.650
<v Speaker 1>able to access people's search engine </v>
<v Speaker 1>results.</v>

1807
01:10:18.651 --> 01:10:22.820
<v Speaker 1>And then also with China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how when Google went over to China,</v>

1808
01:10:22.821 --> 01:10:23.654
<v Speaker 1>like there was very specific things they</v>
<v Speaker 1>had to agree to what the government in </v>

1809
01:10:28.071 --> 01:10:32.930
<v Speaker 1>order to make sure that they were there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had to restrict the searches.</v>

1810
01:10:32.931 --> 01:10:34.640
<v Speaker 1>They had to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had to censor things.</v>

1811
01:10:34.641 --> 01:10:35.474
<v Speaker 1>I mean the government of China does not </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel the same way about freedom as the </v>

1812
01:10:38.121 --> 01:10:38.954
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The United States and the government of </v>

1813
01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:41.930
<v Speaker 1>the United States gets real sketchy with</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1814
01:10:42.030 --> 01:10:42.863
<v Speaker 1>W,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as you're doing what Edward </v>

1815
01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:45.493
<v Speaker 1>Snowden has proven that they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're getting really sketchy with </v>

1816
01:10:47.211 --> 01:10:48.044
<v Speaker 1>freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can land of the free home of </v>

1817
01:10:49.581 --> 01:10:51.710
<v Speaker 1>the brave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Except I want to look at your Dick Pics,</v>

1818
01:10:52.190 --> 01:10:54.230
<v Speaker 1>except I want to read your emails to </v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

1819
01:10:54.231 --> 01:10:55.064
<v Speaker 1>to listen to your voicemails,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except I want to be able to track your </v>

1820
01:10:57.231 --> 01:10:59.000
<v Speaker 1>calls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I accept.</v>

1821
01:10:59.001 --> 01:11:01.850
<v Speaker 1>I want to be able to know where your </v>
<v Speaker 1>phone is at all times.</v>

1822
01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that metadata from where the location of</v>

1823
01:11:04.791 --> 01:11:05.624
<v Speaker 1>your phone is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is one of the primary ways they target </v>

1824
01:11:08.210 --> 01:11:09.320
<v Speaker 1>terrorists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1825
01:11:09.321 --> 01:11:14.090
<v Speaker 1>the people who are not aware of why so </v>
<v Speaker 1>many civilians die and these terrorist</v>

1826
01:11:14.090 --> 01:11:16.320
<v Speaker 3>attacks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the part of the reason,</v>

1827
01:11:16.321 --> 01:11:18.480
<v Speaker 3>especially in the early days of drone </v>
<v Speaker 3>attacks,</v>

1828
01:11:19.210 --> 01:11:20.043
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1829
01:11:20.220 --> 01:11:23.070
<v Speaker 3>when they were trying to target </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrorists rather would,</v>

1830
01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:23.993
<v Speaker 3>was that they would use the metadata.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would find out where the phones </v>

1831
01:11:27.181 --> 01:11:28.014
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if your phone was in this apartment </v>

1832
01:11:29.401 --> 01:11:30.234
<v Speaker 3>building,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to bomb that apartment </v>

1833
01:11:31.261 --> 01:11:32.040
<v Speaker 3>building.</v>

1834
01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:32.910
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

1835
01:11:32.970 --> 01:11:33.231
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1836
01:11:33.231 --> 01:11:34.064
<v Speaker 2>it's very deep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very technical and I have no </v>

1837
01:11:35.401 --> 01:11:37.340
<v Speaker 2>problem with them going to a shadow </v>
<v Speaker 2>court and,</v>

1838
01:11:37.470 --> 01:11:39.030
<v Speaker 2>and getting like a permission to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1839
01:11:39.031 --> 01:11:40.950
<v Speaker 2>we're tracking this guy's full right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

1840
01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:42.073
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're reading this guy or this </v>

1841
01:11:42.631 --> 01:11:43.464
<v Speaker 2>organization's emails or people that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of within seven degrees of </v>

1842
01:11:45.271 --> 01:11:47.130
<v Speaker 2>separation or whatever from this person </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1843
01:11:47.131 --> 01:11:49.140
<v Speaker 2>At least there's some sort of orderly </v>
<v Speaker 2>nature to it.</v>

1844
01:11:49.170 --> 01:11:50.003
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1845
01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:52.280
<v Speaker 2>you don't need to be reading my emails </v>
<v Speaker 2>or my,</v>

1846
01:11:52.340 --> 01:11:52.970
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1847
01:11:52.970 --> 01:11:54.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm just getting uber receipt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sent them an email where it's like,</v>

1848
01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:57.000
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are you even storing all this?</v>

1849
01:11:57.001 --> 01:11:57.601
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is,</v>

1850
01:11:57.601 --> 01:11:59.600
<v Speaker 2>what use is it other than the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously they want friends,</v>

1851
01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:00.473
<v Speaker 2>they want data that they can big high </v>
<v Speaker 2>updata a eagle eye data and saying like </v>

1852
01:12:04.590 --> 01:12:05.940
<v Speaker 2>this is the trend and all these kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1853
01:12:05.940 --> 01:12:08.960
<v Speaker 2>But it's all elba gotten because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's not it,</v>

1854
01:12:08.970 --> 01:12:09.803
<v Speaker 2>it's not right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was the disappointing them and </v>

1855
01:12:11.490 --> 01:12:12.323
<v Speaker 2>you probably feel the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe is like after snowden and the NSA </v>

1856
01:12:15.580 --> 01:12:17.100
<v Speaker 2>was a big store,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then everyone kind of just like,</v>

1857
01:12:17.101 --> 01:12:18.960
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And everyone kind of forgot,</v>

1858
01:12:18.961 --> 01:12:21.900
<v Speaker 2>well they're still kind of doing a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the same kind of thing.</v>

1859
01:12:21.930 --> 01:12:23.700
<v Speaker 2>We didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't affect the way we know about</v>

1860
01:12:23.701 --> 01:12:24.330
<v Speaker 2>it now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we didn't.</v>

1861
01:12:24.330 --> 01:12:26.970
<v Speaker 2>We don't know that the level of change </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was affected really.</v>

1862
01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:28.170
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1863
01:12:28.171 --> 01:12:29.004
<v Speaker 2>and to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like this is the thing where you </v>

1864
01:12:30.161 --> 01:12:32.400
<v Speaker 2>got to keep the pedal down and you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>got to keep going and be like,</v>

1865
01:12:32.401 --> 01:12:34.710
<v Speaker 2>this is not okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not right.</v>

1866
01:12:34.810 --> 01:12:35.810
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1867
01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:37.320
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the same thing with um,</v>

1868
01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:38.673
<v Speaker 2>w with the Patriot Act back in the day </v>
<v Speaker 2>where everyone was really upset about </v>

1869
01:12:40.291 --> 01:12:41.520
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have every right to be upset about.</v>

1870
01:12:41.521 --> 01:12:43.220
<v Speaker 2>That's really egregious stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1871
01:12:43.610 --> 01:12:46.160
<v Speaker 3>A mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the NDA,</v>

1872
01:12:46.161 --> 01:12:49.730
<v Speaker 3>what they've essentially done is they've</v>
<v Speaker 3>eliminated the right of due process.</v>

1873
01:12:49.731 --> 01:12:51.980
<v Speaker 3>They can lock you up for as long as they</v>
<v Speaker 3>want.</v>

1874
01:12:52.010 --> 01:12:56.090
<v Speaker 3>They can deny you any sort of a legal </v>
<v Speaker 3>representation.</v>

1875
01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:56.953
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1876
01:12:57.220 --> 01:12:59.450
<v Speaker 3>that's all been taken away from us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

1877
01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:02.360
<v Speaker 3>What used to be one of the foundations </v>
<v Speaker 3>of being an American,</v>

1878
01:13:02.740 --> 01:13:05.540
<v Speaker 3>the right to due process,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right to have a lawyer,</v>

1879
01:13:05.541 --> 01:13:09.380
<v Speaker 3>the right to a trial of your own peers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All that stuff has kind of gone.</v>

1880
01:13:09.381 --> 01:13:11.510
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just decide that you're a terrorist</v>

1881
01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:13.440
<v Speaker 3>and they could decide you're a terrorist</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you spell,</v>

1882
01:13:13.490 --> 01:13:14.990
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have weed on you,</v>

1883
01:13:15.310 --> 01:13:19.070
<v Speaker 3>if you are involved in illegal drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can be under the Patriot Act,</v>

1884
01:13:19.071 --> 01:13:21.500
<v Speaker 3>considered a terrorist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really kind of crazy.</v>

1885
01:13:21.650 --> 01:13:22.211
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's.</v>

1886
01:13:22.211 --> 01:13:23.044
<v Speaker 2>It's scary in the sense too because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>goes back to what they were saying or </v>

1887
01:13:24.291 --> 01:13:25.124
<v Speaker 2>what this gentleman was saying that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>were just talking about where he was </v>

1888
01:13:26.931 --> 01:13:27.650
<v Speaker 2>saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1889
01:13:27.650 --> 01:13:29.750
<v Speaker 2>they have too much data.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have too much to work with.</v>

1890
01:13:30.130 --> 01:13:31.250
<v Speaker 2>At some point someone has to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1891
01:13:31.251 --> 01:13:33.370
<v Speaker 2>the guy with an ounce of weed or the guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you know,</v>

1892
01:13:33.380 --> 01:13:34.213
<v Speaker 2>even with four ounces of weed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are we dumping him in with all this </v>

1893
01:13:38.331 --> 01:13:39.164
<v Speaker 2>stuff that's just going to muddy the </v>
<v Speaker 2>waters more about the real target that </v>

1894
01:13:41.781 --> 01:13:42.614
<v Speaker 2>we're really going after,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is someone that's actually going </v>

1895
01:13:43.521 --> 01:13:44.354
<v Speaker 2>to hurt someone or someone that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually going to cause a terrorist </v>

1896
01:13:45.651 --> 01:13:47.150
<v Speaker 2>incident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>

1897
01:13:47.151 --> 01:13:47.901
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I were them,</v>

1898
01:13:47.901 --> 01:13:49.010
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need less.</v>

1899
01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:49.873
<v Speaker 2>We need way more targeted data.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to leave 325 million people </v>

1900
01:13:54.351 --> 01:13:55.160
<v Speaker 2>alone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably</v>

1901
01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:55.993
<v Speaker 3>pay the least,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and here's another big part of the </v>

1902
01:13:57.641 --> 01:13:58.474
<v Speaker 3>problem was that when Obama was </v>
<v Speaker 3>instituting these changes and when the </v>

1903
01:14:01.661 --> 01:14:04.240
<v Speaker 3>NDA got passed and when people were </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>

1904
01:14:04.241 --> 01:14:04.870
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1905
01:14:04.870 --> 01:14:05.703
<v Speaker 3>we're never going to use it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is one of the things that they </v>

1906
01:14:07.061 --> 01:14:09.400
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're never going to hold people without</v>

1907
01:14:09.401 --> 01:14:10.234
<v Speaker 3>legal representation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and definitely they were going to use </v>

1908
01:14:11.591 --> 01:14:13.660
<v Speaker 3>the indefinite detainment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1909
01:14:13.661 --> 01:14:16.930
<v Speaker 3>but that's you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What if a crazy person becomes president</v>

1910
01:14:17.770 --> 01:14:20.770
<v Speaker 3>cut to president trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we now have a crazy person,</v>

1911
01:14:21.070 --> 01:14:22.720
<v Speaker 3>crazy person who's now president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're like,</v>

1912
01:14:22.721 --> 01:14:23.554
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now what?</v>

1913
01:14:23.990 --> 01:14:25.630
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what about these fucking crazy laws,</v>

1914
01:14:25.631 --> 01:14:26.464
<v Speaker 3>Obama that you pass when he thought that</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would be nothing but your standard </v>

1915
01:14:28.931 --> 01:14:32.290
<v Speaker 3>politicians and hopefully Democrats from</v>
<v Speaker 3>now to the end of time.</v>

1916
01:14:32.590 --> 01:14:35.350
<v Speaker 3>Guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now it's not now it's a guy who wants to</v>

1917
01:14:35.380 --> 01:14:37.510
<v Speaker 3>dismantle the environmental protection </v>
<v Speaker 3>agency.</v>

1918
01:14:37.511 --> 01:14:40.210
<v Speaker 3>Now it's a guy wants to drill pipelines </v>
<v Speaker 3>through.</v>

1919
01:14:40.270 --> 01:14:45.270
<v Speaker 3>The Dakota access is a guy that wants to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do a lot of stuff that people find to be</v>

1920
01:14:45.431 --> 01:14:50.320
<v Speaker 3>troubling and this guy has the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>rights to use.</v>

1921
01:14:50.380 --> 01:14:54.730
<v Speaker 3>The Nda as you did and he's the new guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's kinda crazy.</v>

1922
01:14:55.030 --> 01:14:55.331
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1923
01:14:55.331 --> 01:14:56.164
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the level of restraint that </v>

1924
01:14:57.191 --> 01:14:59.740
<v Speaker 2>needs to be shown by someone in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>position because</v>

1925
01:14:59.860 --> 01:15:01.020
<v Speaker 3>he hasn't done anything yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1926
01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:01.873
<v Speaker 3>you can't say he has used it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's only been an officer a couple </v>

1927
01:15:03.740 --> 01:15:03.820
<v Speaker 3>months.</v>

1928
01:15:03.820 --> 01:15:04.653
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Given time.</v>

1929
01:15:04.730 --> 01:15:05.563
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to me it's like it goes back to the </v>

1930
01:15:06.791 --> 01:15:09.390
<v Speaker 2>argument of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a executive orders.</v>

1931
01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:11.020
<v Speaker 2>It goes back to the argument of all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these things were,</v>

1932
01:15:11.260 --> 01:15:13.570
<v Speaker 2>or the filibuster in the Senate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1933
01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:16.060
<v Speaker 2>where what's good for the goose is good </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the gander.</v>

1934
01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:16.953
<v Speaker 2>You can't set up these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these rules that are just going to </v>

1935
01:15:18.281 --> 01:15:20.380
<v Speaker 2>backfire on you and then complain about </v>
<v Speaker 2>them later.</v>

1936
01:15:20.381 --> 01:15:22.060
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a huge mistake.</v>

1937
01:15:22.061 --> 01:15:23.660
<v Speaker 2>That's why I have a lot of respect for </v>
<v Speaker 2>presidents.</v>

1938
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:26.110
<v Speaker 2>We haven't had one in a long time that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there are more restrained.</v>

1939
01:15:26.111 --> 01:15:26.944
<v Speaker 2>The presidents at that differ executive </v>
<v Speaker 2>power and actually say like maybe the </v>

1940
01:15:29.351 --> 01:15:31.030
<v Speaker 2>legislature should be dealing with these</v>
<v Speaker 2>kinds of things.</v>

1941
01:15:31.031 --> 01:15:33.130
<v Speaker 2>We need a man like that or someone like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1942
01:15:33.220 --> 01:15:34.031
<v Speaker 2>Who's ever done that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1943
01:15:34.031 --> 01:15:34.571
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back in the,</v>

1944
01:15:34.571 --> 01:15:37.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's been a lot of time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gilded age of coolidge and heart and</v>

1945
01:15:37.601 --> 01:15:38.434
<v Speaker 2>those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but ever since FDR really the imperial </v>

1946
01:15:39.941 --> 01:15:42.100
<v Speaker 2>presidency grew in power and all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>kinds of things.</v>

1947
01:15:42.100 --> 01:15:42.933
<v Speaker 2>And before you knew it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had a little canaries in the coal </v>

1948
01:15:45.131 --> 01:15:45.964
<v Speaker 2>mine with like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was actually talking to dave about it </v>

1949
01:15:46.841 --> 01:15:47.674
<v Speaker 2>last night with Eisenhower with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>military industrial complex and all </v>

1950
01:15:49.661 --> 01:15:50.980
<v Speaker 2>these kinds of amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't it?</v>

1951
01:15:50.981 --> 01:15:51.814
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like an amazing,</v>

1952
01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:52.953
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think people realize how insane </v>

1953
01:15:54.221 --> 01:15:55.054
<v Speaker 2>that is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that man said that will explain what he </v>

1954
01:15:57.581 --> 01:15:59.380
<v Speaker 2>said and when he said it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1955
01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:00.313
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eisenhower was president from a 52 to </v>

1956
01:16:02.831 --> 01:16:04.240
<v Speaker 2>60,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we'll typically 50,</v>

1957
01:16:04.260 --> 01:16:05.093
<v Speaker 2>30,</v>
<v Speaker 2>61.</v>

1958
01:16:05.170 --> 01:16:09.220
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was obviously one of the instrumental</v>

1959
01:16:09.250 --> 01:16:12.170
<v Speaker 2>generals in the allied assaults on Japan</v>
<v Speaker 2>and on,</v>

1960
01:16:12.230 --> 01:16:17.230
<v Speaker 2>on Nazi Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he saw the influence of the military</v>

1961
01:16:17.741 --> 01:16:21.130
<v Speaker 2>growing and that in the Cold War and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nixon era of the Cold War,</v>

1962
01:16:21.131 --> 01:16:21.964
<v Speaker 2>that we were making bombs to make bombs </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we were trying to have conflicts </v>

1963
01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:26.710
<v Speaker 2>with Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which you tried that.</v>

1964
01:16:26.740 --> 01:16:29.680
<v Speaker 2>What she did end in the early fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so seeing that,</v>

1965
01:16:30.010 --> 01:16:34.810
<v Speaker 2>seeing these seeds sown that of </v>
<v Speaker 2>perpetual war of perpetual war,</v>

1966
01:16:34.811 --> 01:16:36.910
<v Speaker 2>that the economy was actually benefiting</v>
<v Speaker 2>from Jamie,</v>

1967
01:16:36.911 --> 01:16:37.744
<v Speaker 2>pull up that speed</v>

1968
01:16:37.900 --> 01:16:38.733
<v Speaker 3>because it's an amazing speech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would be nice for people to hear it </v>

1969
01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:42.233
<v Speaker 3>has a lot of people are not aware of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>tone and the way set it and it was when </v>

1970
01:16:46.151 --> 01:16:46.984
<v Speaker 3>he was leaving off.</v>

1971
01:16:47.140 --> 01:16:48.940
<v Speaker 2>Sorry if I'm not doing a good job of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1972
01:16:48.950 --> 01:16:49.340
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1973
01:16:49.340 --> 01:16:50.560
<v Speaker 2>You did a great job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1974
01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:52.780
<v Speaker 2>And so and so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a man of a military background.</v>

1975
01:16:52.781 --> 01:16:53.614
<v Speaker 2>Everyone loved Eisenhower like because </v>
<v Speaker 2>of what he did in the war and he a two </v>

1976
01:16:57.011 --> 01:17:00.460
<v Speaker 2>term President Nixon was very popular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at the end he was like,</v>

1977
01:17:00.461 --> 01:17:03.070
<v Speaker 2>you gotta watch what's going on over </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

1978
01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:04.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

1979
01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:05.673
<v Speaker 2>you can trust me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm from that world and watch what's </v>

1980
01:17:07.271 --> 01:17:08.104
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a speech.</v>

1981
01:17:08.250 --> 01:17:10.940
<v Speaker 2>Play a Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cool speech.</v>

1982
01:17:11.110 --> 01:17:14.320
<v Speaker 4>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the president of the United States.</v>

1983
01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:16.540
<v Speaker 4>Good evening,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my fellow Americans.</v>

1984
01:17:17.110 --> 01:17:17.943
<v Speaker 4>We now stand 10 years past the midpoint </v>
<v Speaker 4>of a century that has witnessed for </v>

1985
01:17:22.181 --> 01:17:24.210
<v Speaker 4>major wars among great nation</v>

1986
01:17:31.270 --> 01:17:32.103
<v Speaker 4>until the latest of our world conflicts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The United States had no armaments </v>

1987
01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:37.473
<v Speaker 4>industry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>American makers of ploughshares could </v>

1988
01:17:41.650 --> 01:17:45.010
<v Speaker 4>with time and that required make swords </v>
<v Speaker 4>as well,</v>

1989
01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:51.010
<v Speaker 4>but we can no longer risky emergency </v>
<v Speaker 4>improvisation of national defense.</v>

1990
01:17:52.270 --> 01:17:53.103
<v Speaker 4>We have been compelled to create a </v>
<v Speaker 4>Permanent Armand is industry of bash </v>

1991
01:17:56.591 --> 01:17:59.080
<v Speaker 4>proportion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I to do this.</v>

1992
01:17:59.650 --> 01:18:04.600
<v Speaker 4>Three and a half million men and women </v>
<v Speaker 4>are directly engaged in the defense.</v>

1993
01:18:04.630 --> 01:18:05.463
<v Speaker 4>Establish now this conjunction of an </v>
<v Speaker 4>immense military establishment and a </v>

1994
01:18:09.581 --> 01:18:13.720
<v Speaker 4>large arms industry is new in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>American experience,</v>

1995
01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:17.230
<v Speaker 4>but total influence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>economic,</v>

1996
01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:21.520
<v Speaker 4>political,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even spiritual is felt in every city,</v>

1997
01:18:21.970 --> 01:18:24.760
<v Speaker 4>every state house,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every office of the federal government.</v>

1998
01:18:25.810 --> 01:18:28.630
<v Speaker 4>We recognize the imperative need for </v>
<v Speaker 4>this development,</v>

1999
01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:33.100
<v Speaker 4>yet we must not fail to comprehend it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>grave.</v>

2000
01:18:33.130 --> 01:18:36.790
<v Speaker 4>Implications are toil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>resources,</v>

2001
01:18:36.791 --> 01:18:37.624
<v Speaker 4>and livelihood are all involved.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So is the very structure of our society </v>

2002
01:18:42.910 --> 01:18:47.550
<v Speaker 4>and the councils of government.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We must guard against the acquisition of</v>

2003
01:18:47.551 --> 01:18:48.384
<v Speaker 4>unwarranted influence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether sought or unsought by the </v>

2004
01:18:51.421 --> 01:18:56.421
<v Speaker 4>military industrial complex.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The potential for the disastrous rise of</v>

2005
01:18:57.061 --> 01:18:57.894
<v Speaker 4>misplaced power exists and will persist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We must never let the weight of this </v>

2006
01:19:03.081 --> 01:19:06.710
<v Speaker 4>combination endanger our liberties or </v>
<v Speaker 4>democratic processes.</v>

2007
01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:08.900
<v Speaker 4>We should take nothing for granted.</v>

2008
01:19:10.250 --> 01:19:11.083
<v Speaker 4>Only an alert and knowledgeable citizen </v>
<v Speaker 4>can compel the proper meshing of the </v>

2009
01:19:16.251 --> 01:19:21.251
<v Speaker 4>huge industrial and military machinery </v>
<v Speaker 4>of defense with our peaceful methods and</v>

2010
01:19:21.441 --> 01:19:26.030
<v Speaker 4>goals so that security and liberty may </v>
<v Speaker 4>prosper together.</v>

2011
01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:28.690
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an amazing.</v>

2012
01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:30.153
<v Speaker 2>At the time that was an amazing speech </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's just prescient like it's </v>

2013
01:19:33.610 --> 01:19:34.810
<v Speaker 2>because people don't understand and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

2014
01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:36.840
<v Speaker 2>like before World War II,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2015
01:19:37.060 --> 01:19:41.020
<v Speaker 2>we weren't a built up under a </v>
<v Speaker 2>militarized society.</v>

2016
01:19:41.021 --> 01:19:42.670
<v Speaker 2>We would militarize when we need it to </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2017
01:19:42.671 --> 01:19:43.504
<v Speaker 2>and it was really Teddy Roosevelt and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all those kinds of guys that started to </v>

2018
01:19:46.001 --> 01:19:46.834
<v Speaker 2>kind of get a little more bullish and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of regard with the Spanish </v>

2019
01:19:49.810 --> 01:19:51.370
<v Speaker 2>American war and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the USS Maine and,</v>

2020
01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:52.150
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2021
01:19:52.150 --> 01:19:53.800
<v Speaker 2>but the fight over world war one was </v>
<v Speaker 2>real.</v>

2022
01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:55.360
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we didn't want to get involved.</v>

2023
01:19:55.361 --> 01:19:58.360
<v Speaker 2>We got involved very late and people </v>
<v Speaker 2>take for granted.</v>

2024
01:19:58.361 --> 01:20:01.060
<v Speaker 2>Now that we have just massive military </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we have this massive power,</v>

2025
01:20:01.061 --> 01:20:03.110
<v Speaker 2>but then in the 19th century that not </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're,</v>

2026
01:20:03.270 --> 01:20:05.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't equate them necessarily to the</v>

2027
01:20:05.111 --> 01:20:06.730
<v Speaker 2>21st century.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We didn't,</v>

2028
01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:07.593
<v Speaker 2>we weren't going around running rough </v>
<v Speaker 2>shot over people and like doing those </v>

2029
01:20:09.361 --> 01:20:11.100
<v Speaker 2>kinds of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were very isolationist.</v>

2030
01:20:11.101 --> 01:20:11.934
<v Speaker 2>That was kind of the American tradition </v>
<v Speaker 2>and to hear that come out of </v>

2031
01:20:14.911 --> 01:20:15.744
<v Speaker 2>Eisenhower's mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially knowing his experiences in </v>

2032
01:20:17.581 --> 01:20:21.180
<v Speaker 2>the war and his and his deep knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the military and what was going on in</v>

2033
01:20:21.181 --> 01:20:23.940
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's one of the great warnings of all</v>

2034
01:20:23.941 --> 01:20:25.120
<v Speaker 2>time in American history</v>

2035
01:20:25.230 --> 01:20:26.063
<v Speaker 3>and it's very wise in his part because </v>
<v Speaker 3>he recognized that there is survival </v>

2036
01:20:28.501 --> 01:20:33.501
<v Speaker 3>systems that are a part of any industry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2037
01:20:33.950 --> 01:20:34.783
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's survival mechanisms that the </v>

2038
01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:37.073
<v Speaker 3>industry wants to stay alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If all of a sudden there's peace on </v>

2039
01:20:38.791 --> 01:20:41.040
<v Speaker 3>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This gigantic industry,</v>

2040
01:20:41.041 --> 01:20:43.320
<v Speaker 3>this multiple billion dollar a year </v>
<v Speaker 3>industry.</v>

2041
01:20:43.321 --> 01:20:44.280
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how much.</v>

2042
01:20:44.410 --> 01:20:45.810
<v Speaker 3>It's trillions a year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2043
01:20:45.870 --> 01:20:47.700
<v Speaker 3>What is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the military budget?</v>

2044
01:20:47.740 --> 01:20:50.400
<v Speaker 3>Pretty $600,000,000,000 a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>$600,</v>

2045
01:20:50.401 --> 01:20:52.720
<v Speaker 3>million dollars of new spending.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

2046
01:20:52.721 --> 01:20:54.330
<v Speaker 3>you have trillions of dollars worth of </v>
<v Speaker 3>equipment,</v>

2047
01:20:54.540 --> 01:20:58.410
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that massive amount of money,</v>

2048
01:20:58.650 --> 01:21:01.350
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so many people that are involved</v>

2049
01:21:01.351 --> 01:21:02.184
<v Speaker 3>in that and so many jobs that have to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>preserved and so much of the industry </v>

2050
01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:08.340
<v Speaker 3>relies on keeping conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 3>active,</v>

2051
01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:09.393
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>active.</v>

2052
01:21:09.510 --> 01:21:11.790
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's what he was trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>warn us about,</v>

2053
01:21:11.791 --> 01:21:15.510
<v Speaker 3>but it's so interesting about it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>evolve citizenry and that people need to</v>

2054
01:21:15.511 --> 01:21:17.310
<v Speaker 3>be aware of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And to hear that from the president,</v>

2055
01:21:17.311 --> 01:21:18.144
<v Speaker 3>you're never going to hear anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>remotely as even close to his candidate </v>

2056
01:21:21.270 --> 01:21:22.170
<v Speaker 3>is that is today?</v>

2057
01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:23.350
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely not.</v>

2058
01:21:23.351 --> 01:21:26.800
<v Speaker 2>And I think that even hearing that from </v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

2059
01:21:27.010 --> 01:21:28.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to reiterate like hearing that from</v>

2060
01:21:28.570 --> 01:21:30.550
<v Speaker 2>Barack Obama for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would be strong,</v>

2061
01:21:30.551 --> 01:21:31.384
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But hearing that from a ulysses s grant </v>

2062
01:21:32.681 --> 01:21:33.514
<v Speaker 2>or Zachary Taylor or a guy that served </v>
<v Speaker 2>especially the level he served as like </v>

2063
01:21:36.941 --> 01:21:40.030
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that meant something to people and it,</v>

2064
01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:40.913
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that that's why that saying </v>

2065
01:21:41.681 --> 01:21:42.514
<v Speaker 2>never went away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2066
01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:43.393
<v Speaker 2>but under our noses it happened and what</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said was going to happen is exactly </v>

2067
01:21:46.631 --> 01:21:50.650
<v Speaker 2>what happened in the Southeast Asia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Vietnam,</v>

2068
01:21:50.651 --> 01:21:51.484
<v Speaker 2>Cambodia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Laos,</v>

2069
01:21:51.550 --> 01:21:53.950
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he called it from a fucking mile away.</v>

2070
01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:54.873
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't even a mile away because he </v>

2071
01:21:55.511 --> 01:21:56.680
<v Speaker 3>was living there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2072
01:21:56.681 --> 01:21:59.500
<v Speaker 3>he was in the heat of it in 1960 when he</v>
<v Speaker 3>made that speech.</v>

2073
01:21:59.501 --> 01:22:01.120
<v Speaker 3>You think about the Gulf of Tonkin </v>
<v Speaker 3>incident.</v>

2074
01:22:01.121 --> 01:22:03.910
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's just a few years later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>still few years later,</v>

2075
01:22:03.911 --> 01:22:04.744
<v Speaker 3>they had a false flag that allowed </v>
<v Speaker 3>people to get enthusiastic about </v>

2076
01:22:08.231 --> 01:22:10.570
<v Speaker 3>entering into the Vietnam War.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's where it all came from.</v>

2077
01:22:10.650 --> 01:22:11.850
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's the same,</v>

2078
01:22:11.851 --> 01:22:12.684
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people say the USS Maine and </v>

2079
01:22:13.351 --> 01:22:14.184
<v Speaker 2>Spanish American war in 18,</v>
<v Speaker 2>98 was another false flag or something </v>

2080
01:22:15.721 --> 01:22:16.554
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they let happen or something that was </v>

2081
01:22:17.671 --> 01:22:18.980
<v Speaker 2>blown out of proportion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2082
01:22:18.990 --> 01:22:21.150
<v Speaker 2>pardon the pun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it was about shit blowing up.</v>

2083
01:22:21.330 --> 01:22:22.560
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of those,</v>

2084
01:22:22.580 --> 01:22:24.810
<v Speaker 2>it is a provocation that gets everyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>involved.</v>

2085
01:22:24.811 --> 01:22:26.160
<v Speaker 2>And they had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had this nemesis.</v>

2086
01:22:26.161 --> 01:22:28.140
<v Speaker 2>It was good versus evil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were upset when we saw,</v>

2087
01:22:28.170 --> 01:22:29.003
<v Speaker 2>I think especially against the Nazis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we saw what the stature of the good </v>

2088
01:22:32.311 --> 01:22:35.310
<v Speaker 2>versus evil argument and we won.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So with the allies.</v>

2089
01:22:35.311 --> 01:22:36.144
<v Speaker 2>So we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we tried to perpetuate that </v>

2090
01:22:37.110 --> 01:22:37.943
<v Speaker 2>immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Soviets became the evil and then we </v>

2091
01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:42.380
<v Speaker 2>created our bombs and then they created </v>
<v Speaker 2>their bombs and then we just had this,</v>

2092
01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:45.540
<v Speaker 2>these proxy wars that we were fighting </v>
<v Speaker 2>against the Chinese and Korea.</v>

2093
01:22:45.541 --> 01:22:48.480
<v Speaker 2>And then the Soviets in Vietnam really </v>
<v Speaker 2>like all these things that were kind of,</v>

2094
01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:52.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone knew what was going on.</v>

2095
01:22:52.440 --> 01:22:53.520
<v Speaker 2>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

2096
01:22:53.580 --> 01:22:54.560
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please go on.</v>

2097
01:22:54.870 --> 01:22:56.010
<v Speaker 2>Just you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just gonna say.</v>

2098
01:22:56.011 --> 01:22:59.460
<v Speaker 2>So I think that when the Soviet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when everything started to get peaceful,</v>

2099
01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:01.770
<v Speaker 2>I wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they call it glasnost and Soviet,</v>

2100
01:23:01.890 --> 01:23:04.710
<v Speaker 2>Soviet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like the idea of a new era like</v>

2101
01:23:04.711 --> 01:23:07.720
<v Speaker 2>peace and prosperity with the West or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever in like the late seventies,</v>

2102
01:23:07.721 --> 01:23:09.270
<v Speaker 2>early eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that the,</v>

2103
01:23:09.320 --> 01:23:11.680
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Boeings of the world and the,</v>

2104
01:23:11.681 --> 01:23:13.090
<v Speaker 2>and the Halliburtons of the world were </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2105
01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:14.680
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2106
01:23:14.681 --> 01:23:15.401
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2107
01:23:15.401 --> 01:23:17.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>become nineties,</v>

2108
01:23:17.740 --> 01:23:21.850
<v Speaker 2>but we immediately found new targets and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should be wary of why that happened.</v>

2109
01:23:21.900 --> 01:23:22.733
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that we shouldn't </v>

2110
01:23:22.961 --> 01:23:24.790
<v Speaker 2>necessarily fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to fight sometimes,</v>

2111
01:23:25.150 --> 01:23:27.250
<v Speaker 2>but to have this industrialized nature </v>
<v Speaker 2>of it,</v>

2112
01:23:27.251 --> 01:23:30.550
<v Speaker 2>to have this need to lurch from one war </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the next quarter,</v>

2113
01:23:30.551 --> 01:23:33.250
<v Speaker 2>the next quarter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the next war is not what a,</v>

2114
01:23:33.290 --> 01:23:35.680
<v Speaker 2>a thriving republic does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's what a dying empire does.</v>

2115
01:23:36.220 --> 01:23:37.140
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely</v>

2116
01:23:37.170 --> 01:23:38.003
<v Speaker 3>what an empire that's dependent upon the</v>
<v Speaker 3>control or the or rather an industry </v>

2117
01:23:42.421 --> 01:23:43.254
<v Speaker 3>rather than.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's dependent upon the control that it </v>

2118
01:23:44.341 --> 01:23:47.460
<v Speaker 3>has currently maintaining it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need to maintain that,</v>

2119
01:23:47.490 --> 01:23:50.400
<v Speaker 3>that money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need to maintain the business.</v>

2120
01:23:50.401 --> 01:23:54.420
<v Speaker 3>The business of making these machines </v>
<v Speaker 3>and of having these contracts,</v>

2121
01:23:54.660 --> 01:23:59.490
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's a huge industry and like all</v>
<v Speaker 3>of these unlimited growth industries,</v>

2122
01:23:59.970 --> 01:24:04.410
<v Speaker 3>it's very like every business </v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially operates under this paradigm</v>

2123
01:24:04.411 --> 01:24:06.270
<v Speaker 3>of unlimited growth or most businesses </v>
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

2124
01:24:06.271 --> 01:24:07.104
<v Speaker 3>Most corporations do where they kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>every year they want to make more money </v>

2125
01:24:09.450 --> 01:24:10.283
<v Speaker 3>and if that's applicable to accompany </v>
<v Speaker 3>that makes tanks well every year they </v>

2126
01:24:15.601 --> 01:24:17.130
<v Speaker 3>want to make more money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want to make more tanks.</v>

2127
01:24:17.131 --> 01:24:19.500
<v Speaker 3>We don't need tanks anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well how the fuck you don't.</v>

2128
01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:20.633
<v Speaker 3>You definitely need to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh look what's going on over here in </v>

2129
01:24:21.541 --> 01:24:22.380
<v Speaker 3>Yemen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Real Shit.</v>

2130
01:24:22.381 --> 01:24:23.400
<v Speaker 3>You need some tanks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2131
01:24:23.401 --> 01:24:25.620
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's means team America,</v>

2132
01:24:25.621 --> 01:24:26.460
<v Speaker 3>world police.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2133
01:24:26.670 --> 01:24:27.510
<v Speaker 3>it's really crazy.</v>

2134
01:24:27.550 --> 01:24:31.360
<v Speaker 2>It's scary and it's a scary waste of </v>
<v Speaker 2>money too because I don't think that we.</v>

2135
01:24:31.720 --> 01:24:34.420
<v Speaker 2>I really do feel like we should have the</v>
<v Speaker 2>most powerful military in the world.</v>

2136
01:24:34.421 --> 01:24:35.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that there's anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong with that.</v>

2137
01:24:35.681 --> 01:24:37.870
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a powerful Republican have those</v>

2138
01:24:37.871 --> 01:24:38.704
<v Speaker 2>kinds of things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we don't need all of these bases </v>

2139
01:24:39.701 --> 01:24:41.560
<v Speaker 2>that are legacy basis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are we still in Japan?</v>

2140
01:24:41.561 --> 01:24:42.394
<v Speaker 2>Why are we still in place?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They talk some shit and or Godzilla </v>

2141
01:24:44.771 --> 01:24:45.470
<v Speaker 2>shows up.</v>

2142
01:24:45.470 --> 01:24:46.303
<v Speaker 3>Trump's proposed height to military </v>
<v Speaker 3>spending is bigger than all but two </v>

2143
01:24:48.561 --> 01:24:50.000
<v Speaker 3>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Entire budgets.</v>

2144
01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:52.520
<v Speaker 3>Well that's because we're America and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're better than everybody else.</v>

2145
01:24:52.610 --> 01:24:53.361
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to say it.</v>

2146
01:24:53.361 --> 01:24:55.610
<v Speaker 2>That communists shit off my screen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to say,</v>

2147
01:24:55.670 --> 01:24:59.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to say I think this is right that</v>

2148
01:24:59.570 --> 01:25:02.630
<v Speaker 2>if you split the military spending of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world in thirds,</v>

2149
01:25:03.110 --> 01:25:05.030
<v Speaker 2>we've.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are responsible for a third of it.</v>

2150
01:25:05.450 --> 01:25:06.283
<v Speaker 2>10 countries are responsible for another</v>
<v Speaker 2>third of it and then everyone else is </v>

2151
01:25:08.991 --> 01:25:09.824
<v Speaker 2>responsible for another third of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have four and a half percent of the </v>

2152
01:25:12.111 --> 01:25:12.944
<v Speaker 2>world's population,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is way out of whack when with </v>

2153
01:25:15.820 --> 01:25:16.653
<v Speaker 2>with even our needs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like our actual very need to protect </v>

2154
01:25:19.191 --> 01:25:20.600
<v Speaker 2>ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just way out of whack.</v>

2155
01:25:20.670 --> 01:25:21.100
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2156
01:25:21.100 --> 01:25:25.810
<v Speaker 3>But when you get past those 10 countries</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there are other third and then us,</v>

2157
01:25:25.811 --> 01:25:26.644
<v Speaker 3>that's 11 countries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody else is using coconuts and </v>

2158
01:25:28.421 --> 01:25:29.254
<v Speaker 3>catapults.</v>

2159
01:25:29.490 --> 01:25:31.980
<v Speaker 2>That's essentially throwing rocks at </v>
<v Speaker 2>each other.</v>

2160
01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:34.140
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's relative tranquility,</v>

2161
01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:38.790
<v Speaker 2>like outside of the Middle East and in </v>
<v Speaker 2>East Eastern Europe with the Ukraine and</v>

2162
01:25:38.791 --> 01:25:42.770
<v Speaker 2>Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's general peace to be had in,</v>

2163
01:25:42.771 --> 01:25:43.604
<v Speaker 2>in these countries that might not spend </v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of money or might not even have a </v>

2164
01:25:45.031 --> 01:25:45.864
<v Speaker 2>lot of money to spend them on saying I </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to live like they do with that I </v>

2165
01:25:47.341 --> 01:25:48.060
<v Speaker 2>want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to spend,</v>

2166
01:25:48.060 --> 01:25:49.410
<v Speaker 2>say I want to live like they do in Sri </v>
<v Speaker 2>Lanka,</v>

2167
01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:50.820
<v Speaker 2>Bangladesh or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm saying like,</v>

2168
01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:52.140
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you racist.</v>

2169
01:25:52.860 --> 01:25:54.840
<v Speaker 2>That's already been established by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>International Business Times.</v>

2170
01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:56.550
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to me,</v>

2171
01:25:56.560 --> 01:25:57.870
<v Speaker 2>I just look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2172
01:25:57.871 --> 01:25:59.600
<v Speaker 2>we can spend this money wiser and we can</v>
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>

2173
01:25:59.640 --> 01:26:01.710
<v Speaker 2>we can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can ramp up and have plans to ramp up</v>

2174
01:26:01.711 --> 01:26:02.940
<v Speaker 2>people forget.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

2175
01:26:03.770 --> 01:26:04.603
<v Speaker 2>Gm Ford,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these guys were making our </v>

2176
01:26:05.871 --> 01:26:06.920
<v Speaker 2>armaments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2177
01:26:06.921 --> 01:26:09.920
<v Speaker 2>Mitsubishi made the Japanese Zeroes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>IBM offshoots of IBM.</v>

2178
01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:12.350
<v Speaker 2>We're making frigging punch card </v>
<v Speaker 2>machines for the Nazis.</v>

2179
01:26:12.590 --> 01:26:13.730
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people,</v>

2180
01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:14.481
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2181
01:26:14.481 --> 01:26:15.314
<v Speaker 2>for better or for worse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ramp up and do what they need to do in </v>

2182
01:26:17.031 --> 01:26:17.864
<v Speaker 2>times of war to make money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we could have a plan in place to </v>

2183
01:26:19.851 --> 01:26:20.241
<v Speaker 2>say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2184
01:26:20.241 --> 01:26:22.670
<v Speaker 2>if we need to ramp up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's something bad happens if we need to</v>

2185
01:26:22.671 --> 01:26:23.504
<v Speaker 2>go overseas or something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we have to go engage the Russians </v>

2186
01:26:25.371 --> 01:26:27.830
<v Speaker 2>because they're rolling into the rest of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ukraine for instance,</v>

2187
01:26:28.100 --> 01:26:29.960
<v Speaker 2>we have the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the we can,</v>

2188
01:26:30.020 --> 01:26:32.780
<v Speaker 2>we can take care of that without having </v>
<v Speaker 2>bases all over the world.</v>

2189
01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:33.673
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem with that kind of thinking </v>

2190
01:26:34.731 --> 01:26:36.740
<v Speaker 2>is as soon as you say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they realize,</v>

2191
01:26:36.741 --> 01:26:39.080
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of money to be had if that</v>

2192
01:26:39.110 --> 01:26:41.450
<v Speaker 2>is the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's make that the case.</v>

2193
01:26:41.750 --> 01:26:45.740
<v Speaker 2>And then there's some weird fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>covert sneaky shit going down.</v>

2194
01:26:45.740 --> 01:26:48.660
<v Speaker 2>And do you have an earring on both ears?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

2195
01:26:49.140 --> 01:26:51.170
<v Speaker 2>the other headphones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Irritating.</v>

2196
01:26:51.180 --> 01:26:52.013
<v Speaker 2>You don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just like to hear whenever I did I do </v>

2197
01:26:53.421 --> 01:26:55.070
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not all the hearings had been in since I</v>

2198
01:26:55.071 --> 01:26:57.070
<v Speaker 2>was like 18.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just took them out.</v>

2199
01:26:57.071 --> 01:26:59.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm superstitious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're superstitious.</v>

2200
01:26:59.871 --> 01:27:00.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't like to,</v>

2201
01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:03.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not like over overtly superstitious,</v>

2202
01:27:03.081 --> 01:27:05.450
<v Speaker 2>but I'm afraid to take them out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm afraid to do different things.</v>

2203
01:27:05.451 --> 01:27:07.190
<v Speaker 2>You have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we the people tattoo on your arm?</v>

2204
01:27:07.220 --> 01:27:07.491
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

2205
01:27:07.491 --> 01:27:10.860
<v Speaker 2>the people and then I have franklins </v>
<v Speaker 2>association snake on here.</v>

2206
01:27:10.900 --> 01:27:12.920
<v Speaker 2>So you're like join or die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2207
01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:13.873
<v Speaker 2>So you're like a serious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost like a fan of politics that way </v>

2208
01:27:18.990 --> 01:27:20.030
<v Speaker 2>to describe it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

2209
01:27:20.031 --> 01:27:20.864
<v Speaker 2>I meant when I went to college,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to school for American history </v>

2210
01:27:23.150 --> 01:27:25.550
<v Speaker 2>and I graduated and when I got my job </v>
<v Speaker 2>offer in the video game industry,</v>

2211
01:27:25.551 --> 01:27:26.384
<v Speaker 2>I was about to start my graduate degree </v>
<v Speaker 2>at northeastern in American history </v>

2212
01:27:29.211 --> 01:27:30.710
<v Speaker 2>because I want it to be a professor at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>

2213
01:27:31.010 --> 01:27:34.070
<v Speaker 2>So my real passion was American history </v>
<v Speaker 2>in American politics,</v>

2214
01:27:34.071 --> 01:27:36.170
<v Speaker 2>but I veered off into a different </v>
<v Speaker 2>direction.</v>

2215
01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:38.340
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please go ahead.</v>

2216
01:27:38.410 --> 01:27:39.740
<v Speaker 2>I was just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so these are like relics,</v>

2217
01:27:39.741 --> 01:27:42.190
<v Speaker 2>so I got these when I was like 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

2218
01:27:42.230 --> 01:27:43.310
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's interesting man.</v>

2219
01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:44.153
<v Speaker 2>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are unusual tattoos for 20 year </v>

2220
01:27:45.231 --> 01:27:45.870
<v Speaker 2>old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2221
01:27:45.870 --> 01:27:46.880
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

2222
01:27:46.881 --> 01:27:47.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2223
01:27:47.290 --> 01:27:48.270
<v Speaker 2>I love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2224
01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:50.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm really interested in the founding </v>
<v Speaker 2>generation.</v>

2225
01:27:50.511 --> 01:27:52.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm really interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in their experiences.</v>

2226
01:27:52.311 --> 01:27:56.390
<v Speaker 2>And the American revolution I think is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fascinating revolution compared to a lot</v>

2227
01:27:56.391 --> 01:27:58.250
<v Speaker 2>of other revolutions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Primarily because it is,</v>

2228
01:27:58.310 --> 01:28:00.590
<v Speaker 2>I think it inherently in some ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative revolution,</v>

2229
01:28:00.591 --> 01:28:01.424
<v Speaker 2>which is not common.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These were incredibly rich people </v>

2230
01:28:03.650 --> 01:28:04.483
<v Speaker 2>fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These weren't like poor destitute </v>

2231
01:28:06.081 --> 01:28:08.690
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>John Hancock had something like 350th of</v>

2232
01:28:08.691 --> 01:28:10.850
<v Speaker 2>all of the value of the colonies under </v>
<v Speaker 2>is under his name.</v>

2233
01:28:11.420 --> 01:28:13.070
<v Speaker 2>People had everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the risk and everything to lose,</v>

2234
01:28:13.370 --> 01:28:15.500
<v Speaker 2>so it's like an interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

2235
01:28:15.501 --> 01:28:16.850
<v Speaker 2>very principled revolution that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>fought.</v>

2236
01:28:16.850 --> 01:28:17.683
<v Speaker 2>Although if you read like Howard Zinn or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that they would say that they </v>

2237
01:28:18.981 --> 01:28:21.590
<v Speaker 2>did it to protect their money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm sure they did,</v>

2238
01:28:21.591 --> 01:28:23.690
<v Speaker 2>but I'm sure they had other motives as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

2239
01:28:23.780 --> 01:28:25.610
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's a.</v>

2240
01:28:26.060 --> 01:28:28.640
<v Speaker 2>it's a sort of an unprecedented thing in</v>
<v Speaker 2>human history.</v>

2241
01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:29.593
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a really crazy union that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we've established over here to see all </v>

2242
01:28:34.041 --> 01:28:37.760
<v Speaker 2>of these things that threaten what we </v>
<v Speaker 2>find so amazing about it.</v>

2243
01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:40.310
<v Speaker 2>Like the violations of the fourth </v>
<v Speaker 2>amendment,</v>

2244
01:28:40.340 --> 01:28:41.173
<v Speaker 2>all the NSA stuff with Edward Snowden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these different things that we see </v>

2245
01:28:43.851 --> 01:28:47.390
<v Speaker 2>that that are huge problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they are is also they're.</v>

2246
01:28:47.391 --> 01:28:48.224
<v Speaker 2>They're weakening the foundation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these ideas that were so amazing when </v>

2247
01:28:52.011 --> 01:28:54.680
<v Speaker 2>they were first established in 17,</v>
<v Speaker 2>76 and,</v>

2248
01:28:54.681 --> 01:28:55.514
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me that's why I think that they're </v>

2249
01:28:56.721 --> 01:28:57.554
<v Speaker 2>worth protecting and it goes to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it goes into the like is the </v>

2250
01:28:59.030 --> 01:29:00.260
<v Speaker 2>constitution living or not?</v>

2251
01:29:00.260 --> 01:29:01.093
<v Speaker 2>Is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a strict constructionist or loose </v>

2252
01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:03.540
<v Speaker 2>constructionists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All those kinds of questions I think are</v>

2253
01:29:03.541 --> 01:29:05.010
<v Speaker 2>valid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to me I'm like,</v>

2254
01:29:05.011 --> 01:29:05.844
<v Speaker 2>we can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have this very unique vision into </v>

2255
01:29:08.311 --> 01:29:11.160
<v Speaker 2>what the founders intended because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were one of the few,</v>

2256
01:29:11.250 --> 01:29:13.170
<v Speaker 2>I think people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people at that time that were like,</v>

2257
01:29:13.171 --> 01:29:14.190
<v Speaker 2>we're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2258
01:29:14.191 --> 01:29:16.620
<v Speaker 2>the federalist papers are incredible if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you read them,</v>

2259
01:29:16.621 --> 01:29:18.600
<v Speaker 2>like we don't have to wonder what they </v>
<v Speaker 2>meant.</v>

2260
01:29:18.930 --> 01:29:21.180
<v Speaker 2>They literally tell you exactly what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they meant.</v>

2261
01:29:21.510 --> 01:29:23.730
<v Speaker 2>So when you go to supreme court cases,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that there are many supreme</v>

2262
01:29:23.731 --> 01:29:26.010
<v Speaker 2>court cases that don't even reference </v>
<v Speaker 2>the federalist papers because it's like,</v>

2263
01:29:26.011 --> 01:29:28.050
<v Speaker 2>well they said this an article three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>section two,</v>

2264
01:29:28.051 --> 01:29:31.830
<v Speaker 2>but actually in this paper that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrote anonymously that we know Alexander</v>

2265
01:29:31.830 --> 01:29:33.870
<v Speaker 2>Hamilton wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's what he said about it.</v>

2266
01:29:34.010 --> 01:29:35.940
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's interesting stuff.</v>

2267
01:29:36.210 --> 01:29:37.043
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how did this knowledge of politics and </v>

2268
01:29:39.340 --> 01:29:42.510
<v Speaker 3>how this fascination that you have with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the history of the United States,</v>

2269
01:29:42.810 --> 01:29:45.270
<v Speaker 3>how did this get you in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2270
01:29:45.271 --> 01:29:46.104
<v Speaker 3>quote unquote trouble in the video game </v>
<v Speaker 3>industry with these people that are </v>

2271
01:29:49.141 --> 01:29:52.710
<v Speaker 3>predominantly left wing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>predominantly progressive?</v>

2272
01:29:52.730 --> 01:29:54.090
<v Speaker 3>Like quota?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say progressive,</v>

2273
01:29:54.091 --> 01:29:56.040
<v Speaker 3>but progressive is kind of a dirty word </v>
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>

2274
01:29:56.070 --> 01:29:58.280
<v Speaker 3>but it's coming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a difference between liberal and</v>

2275
01:29:58.290 --> 01:29:59.123
<v Speaker 3>progressive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2276
01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:01.770
<v Speaker 3>it would be great if everybody was </v>
<v Speaker 3>liberal.</v>

2277
01:30:01.800 --> 01:30:02.633
<v Speaker 3>If it would be great if everybody was </v>
<v Speaker 3>progressive and it'd be great if </v>

2278
01:30:04.681 --> 01:30:05.514
<v Speaker 3>everybody wanted people to have freedom </v>
<v Speaker 3>of choice and freedom to be whoever you </v>

2279
01:30:10.141 --> 01:30:10.974
<v Speaker 3>want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's not really what those things </v>

2280
01:30:12.031 --> 01:30:14.460
<v Speaker 3>are anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those things are like ideologies.</v>

2281
01:30:14.461 --> 01:30:15.294
<v Speaker 3>There are these predetermined patterns </v>
<v Speaker 3>of behavior that people subscribe to in </v>

2282
01:30:17.631 --> 01:30:19.350
<v Speaker 3>a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very rigid way.</v>

2283
01:30:20.040 --> 01:30:20.873
<v Speaker 3>How,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what did you find was an issue when </v>

2284
01:30:24.270 --> 01:30:25.103
<v Speaker 3>people found out about your extreme </v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding and a respect for the </v>

2285
01:30:31.081 --> 01:30:31.920
<v Speaker 3>history of the United States?</v>

2286
01:30:32.020 --> 01:30:32.950
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they think it's a.</v>

2287
01:30:33.070 --> 01:30:36.160
<v Speaker 2>primarily they think it was kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>joke because not not,</v>

2288
01:30:36.161 --> 01:30:37.330
<v Speaker 2>not a hot hydro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like you're,</v>

2289
01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:39.070
<v Speaker 2>you're a clown kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because why?</v>

2290
01:30:39.340 --> 01:30:41.470
<v Speaker 2>Because I believe in small government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>

2291
01:30:41.471 --> 01:30:42.304
<v Speaker 2>I believe in low taxation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe in the elimination of the </v>

2292
01:30:43.691 --> 01:30:44.920
<v Speaker 2>income tax and things like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are,</v>

2293
01:30:44.950 --> 01:30:46.660
<v Speaker 2>these are Rad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't actually have like,</v>

2294
01:30:46.750 --> 01:30:49.210
<v Speaker 2>not all my ideas are radical or even </v>
<v Speaker 2>outside of the mainstream.</v>

2295
01:30:49.450 --> 01:30:50.283
<v Speaker 2>Socially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm probably further to the left that </v>

2296
01:30:51.521 --> 01:30:52.420
<v Speaker 2>many of these people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2297
01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:55.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that it goes back to this idea,</v>

2298
01:30:55.660 --> 01:30:57.640
<v Speaker 2>and this is something Dave Rubin has </v>
<v Speaker 2>touched on a lot in this show,</v>

2299
01:30:57.790 --> 01:30:58.623
<v Speaker 2>which I'm sure you're familiar with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is this idea that it's really all </v>

2300
01:31:01.031 --> 01:31:01.864
<v Speaker 2>or nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they don't want to be an ally with </v>

2301
01:31:03.551 --> 01:31:05.050
<v Speaker 2>someone that might be able to help them </v>
<v Speaker 2>in x,</v>

2302
01:31:05.051 --> 01:31:07.020
<v Speaker 2>Y,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Z if they disagree with people in a,</v>

2303
01:31:07.021 --> 01:31:07.750
<v Speaker 2>B and c.</v>

2304
01:31:07.750 --> 01:31:09.430
<v Speaker 2>So they could have had a great ally in </v>
<v Speaker 2>me and being like,</v>

2305
01:31:09.431 --> 01:31:11.980
<v Speaker 2>I've been pro gay marriage forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been pro choice.</v>

2306
01:31:12.010 --> 01:31:12.910
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2307
01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:13.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2308
01:31:13.930 --> 01:31:14.763
<v Speaker 2>for the decriminalization of drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm for the legalization of </v>

2309
01:31:16.751 --> 01:31:17.584
<v Speaker 2>prostitution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm for a lot of these things that are </v>

2310
01:31:18.431 --> 01:31:19.264
<v Speaker 2>very far to the left socially that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably could find some agreement on </v>

2311
01:31:21.491 --> 01:31:22.324
<v Speaker 2>somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we can work on those things and get </v>

2312
01:31:23.141 --> 01:31:25.660
<v Speaker 2>those things done together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But because I say also like,</v>

2313
01:31:25.661 --> 01:31:26.494
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the income tax is predatory and really </v>

2314
01:31:28.721 --> 01:31:29.800
<v Speaker 2>hurts people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I own a business.</v>

2315
01:31:29.801 --> 01:31:31.810
<v Speaker 2>I owned a business and I went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I want another one now.</v>

2316
01:31:32.140 --> 01:31:32.973
<v Speaker 2>And I know that I could have hired </v>
<v Speaker 2>another person if taxes weren't so </v>

2317
01:31:35.111 --> 01:31:36.610
<v Speaker 2>onerous on me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2318
01:31:36.700 --> 01:31:38.760
<v Speaker 2>and so I also stand on there and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2319
01:31:38.940 --> 01:31:40.480
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this never happened.</v>

2320
01:31:40.840 --> 01:31:42.070
<v Speaker 2>This stuff that you just said never </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>

2321
01:31:42.071 --> 01:31:43.660
<v Speaker 2>This left this left wing stuff that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>agree on.</v>

2322
01:31:43.661 --> 01:31:44.494
<v Speaker 2>Never happened because you don't believe</v>
<v Speaker 2>in because you have this one thing that </v>

2323
01:31:46.811 --> 01:31:47.644
<v Speaker 2>we have a problem with</v>

2324
01:31:47.830 --> 01:31:50.000
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you're not being clear about that.</v>

2325
01:31:50.001 --> 01:31:50.480
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

2326
01:31:50.480 --> 01:31:52.130
<v Speaker 3>what is the issue?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2327
01:31:52.131 --> 01:31:54.950
<v Speaker 3>I wanted it comes to small government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you wanting small government.</v>

2328
01:31:54.951 --> 01:31:56.990
<v Speaker 3>What's the opposition to that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do they say?</v>

2329
01:31:57.080 --> 01:31:58.250
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they say like a,</v>

2330
01:31:58.290 --> 01:31:59.123
<v Speaker 2>they make a of it's insinuations because</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of it isn't even things that I </v>

2331
01:32:00.941 --> 01:32:03.130
<v Speaker 2>feel or believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So an example would be,</v>

2332
01:32:03.131 --> 01:32:04.270
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2333
01:32:04.900 --> 01:32:07.600
<v Speaker 2>I see a lot of people say all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a column doesn't believe in welfare</v>

2334
01:32:07.750 --> 01:32:09.820
<v Speaker 2>or column doesn't believe in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in social security.</v>

2335
01:32:09.830 --> 01:32:11.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never said that actually.</v>

2336
01:32:11.561 --> 01:32:12.394
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that these things should be </v>

2337
01:32:13.421 --> 01:32:18.070
<v Speaker 2>reformed and maybe take it back a step.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they even look at that as a push too</v>

2338
01:32:18.071 --> 01:32:19.390
<v Speaker 2>far on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the system.</v>

2339
01:32:19.540 --> 01:32:20.373
<v Speaker 2>I guess what I'm trying to say to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm sorry I'm not being more lucid </v>

2340
01:32:21.701 --> 01:32:23.740
<v Speaker 2>with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying my hardest is,</v>

2341
01:32:23.800 --> 01:32:25.030
<v Speaker 2>is that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2342
01:32:25.680 --> 01:32:30.600
<v Speaker 2>you have to agree with them lockstep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they see you in one way that is,</v>

2343
01:32:30.740 --> 01:32:31.573
<v Speaker 2>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is injurious to their cars or two that </v>

2344
01:32:33.271 --> 01:32:35.400
<v Speaker 2>is conflicting or contrary to what they </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe.</v>

2345
01:32:35.700 --> 01:32:38.460
<v Speaker 2>They do not give a fuck about anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>else you believe.</v>

2346
01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:40.620
<v Speaker 2>And that's the thing that always </v>
<v Speaker 2>frustrated me and what so surprising you</v>

2347
01:32:40.621 --> 01:32:41.454
<v Speaker 2>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The people were really were running me </v>

2348
01:32:41.821 --> 01:32:43.830
<v Speaker 2>out on a rail out of the gaming industry</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the,</v>

2349
01:32:43.860 --> 01:32:44.693
<v Speaker 2>with a completely innocuous joke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think tells you everything you </v>

2350
01:32:46.711 --> 01:32:50.420
<v Speaker 2>need to know about the the intent that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't see.</v>

2351
01:32:50.460 --> 01:32:52.140
<v Speaker 2>They don't want allies in different </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways.</v>

2352
01:32:52.260 --> 01:32:54.780
<v Speaker 2>Allies in different close allies and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they want just.</v>

2353
01:32:54.810 --> 01:32:57.100
<v Speaker 2>They just want complete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2354
01:32:57.300 --> 01:32:59.850
<v Speaker 2>it's very orwellian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just want you to be completely like</v>

2355
01:32:59.851 --> 01:33:00.684
<v Speaker 2>them and if you're not like then they </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want anything to do with you and </v>

2356
01:33:02.701 --> 01:33:04.860
<v Speaker 2>it's these and it's not even like I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>advocating for anything crazy.</v>

2357
01:33:04.861 --> 01:33:06.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't advocate for anything crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think</v>

2358
01:33:07.270 --> 01:33:08.103
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't sound crazy at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what's interesting is we've kind of </v>

2359
01:33:11.950 --> 01:33:12.783
<v Speaker 3>turned a corner where in many ways the </v>
<v Speaker 3>right is more tolerant than the left to </v>

2360
01:33:16.721 --> 01:33:17.554
<v Speaker 3>variations in their ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas the right is much more tolerant </v>

2361
01:33:21.131 --> 01:33:21.964
<v Speaker 3>to people that support gay marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The right is much more tolerant to </v>

2362
01:33:24.131 --> 01:33:25.480
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>

2363
01:33:26.100 --> 01:33:27.640
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You fill in the blanks.</v>

2364
01:33:27.641 --> 01:33:28.474
<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch of different rights that</v>
<v Speaker 3>the right would sort of accept from </v>

2365
01:33:32.831 --> 01:33:36.480
<v Speaker 3>someone who also voted Republican,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the left isn't like if,</v>

2366
01:33:36.481 --> 01:33:37.314
<v Speaker 3>if you got to the point where like I got</v>
<v Speaker 3>into a heated argument with someone </v>

2367
01:33:40.361 --> 01:33:42.910
<v Speaker 3>wants about abortion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I'm pro choice,</v>

2368
01:33:43.270 --> 01:33:45.490
<v Speaker 3>but what I was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well essentially,</v>

2369
01:33:45.491 --> 01:33:46.324
<v Speaker 3>but obviously it was a criticism of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Richard Dawkins quote where he's </v>

2370
01:33:48.550 --> 01:33:53.550
<v Speaker 3>comparing a human embryo to a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a pig fetus or a pig embryo.</v>

2371
01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:55.930
<v Speaker 3>I forget what the terms of use,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm like,</v>

2372
01:33:55.931 --> 01:33:56.764
<v Speaker 3>well that's ridiculous because one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>them is going to become a person if you </v>

2373
01:33:58.871 --> 01:34:00.320
<v Speaker 3>don't take it out of your body.</v>

2374
01:34:00.370 --> 01:34:03.190
<v Speaker 3>And that was the idea behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you can't,</v>

2375
01:34:03.610 --> 01:34:06.850
<v Speaker 3>you can't use that sort of an analogy </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's not true.</v>

2376
01:34:06.910 --> 01:34:07.743
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just one has the potential </v>
<v Speaker 3>for being a person and I was being </v>

2377
01:34:10.271 --> 01:34:12.850
<v Speaker 3>accused by this guy of being right wing </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of it.</v>

2378
01:34:13.150 --> 01:34:13.631
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2379
01:34:13.631 --> 01:34:15.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm not right wing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just talking about the potential for</v>

2380
01:34:15.911 --> 01:34:16.744
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a pig embryo is never going to be </v>

2381
01:34:18.670 --> 01:34:21.190
<v Speaker 3>my neighbor Mike.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just not.</v>

2382
01:34:21.250 --> 01:34:23.290
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that baby,</v>

2383
01:34:23.291 --> 01:34:24.124
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying you should be forced to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make that baby a person and keep it in </v>

2384
01:34:26.941 --> 01:34:31.720
<v Speaker 3>your body when it's a few cells and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>two weeks old and then sit you.</v>

2385
01:34:31.721 --> 01:34:36.130
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that you can't choose </v>
<v Speaker 3>when to terminate your pregnancy,</v>

2386
01:34:36.310 --> 01:34:38.530
<v Speaker 3>but what I'm saying is you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>terminating a pregnancy.</v>

2387
01:34:38.830 --> 01:34:39.663
<v Speaker 3>We both know what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying you shouldn't be able to </v>

2388
01:34:41.351 --> 01:34:42.184
<v Speaker 3>do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to pretend that it's not messy and </v>

2389
01:34:43.241 --> 01:34:45.010
<v Speaker 3>nobody wants it to be messy.</v>

2390
01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:48.010
<v Speaker 3>Nobody wants to be a complicated issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They wanted to be cut and dry.</v>

2391
01:34:48.011 --> 01:34:50.860
<v Speaker 3>If you're on the left in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's pro choice,</v>

2392
01:34:51.040 --> 01:34:51.873
<v Speaker 3>a woman's reproductive choice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>freedom of your body to do what you </v>

2393
01:34:55.271 --> 01:34:56.560
<v Speaker 3>want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get all that.</v>

2394
01:34:56.561 --> 01:34:58.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm 100 percent with you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but let's.</v>

2395
01:34:58.670 --> 01:35:01.550
<v Speaker 3>Let's not lie about what it is because </v>
<v Speaker 3>as soon as we know,</v>

2396
01:35:01.850 --> 01:35:04.580
<v Speaker 3>as soon as we distort the reality of </v>
<v Speaker 3>what the thing is,</v>

2397
01:35:05.210 --> 01:35:06.043
<v Speaker 3>then we put up these ideological </v>
<v Speaker 3>boundaries and blinders and we make </v>

2398
01:35:09.171 --> 01:35:10.004
<v Speaker 3>communication very difficult and we make</v>
<v Speaker 3>these rigid ideologies almost like a </v>

2399
01:35:13.581 --> 01:35:16.130
<v Speaker 3>religion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are almost like dogma.</v>

2400
01:35:16.340 --> 01:35:17.600
<v Speaker 3>And when you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put it.</v>

2401
01:35:17.750 --> 01:35:18.680
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you do that,</v>

2402
01:35:18.681 --> 01:35:21.140
<v Speaker 3>you have real problems because people </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't communicate,</v>

2403
01:35:21.141 --> 01:35:23.270
<v Speaker 3>so if someone does bring that up and </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

2404
01:35:23.271 --> 01:35:24.300
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2405
01:35:24.350 --> 01:35:28.430
<v Speaker 3>what is abortion?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then silence across the dinner table</v>

2406
01:35:28.431 --> 01:35:30.280
<v Speaker 3>you hear people dropping their forks and</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2407
01:35:30.310 --> 01:35:31.010
<v Speaker 3>what is abortion?</v>

2408
01:35:31.010 --> 01:35:34.970
<v Speaker 3>What are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're at what age is it okay to have an</v>

2409
01:35:34.971 --> 01:35:36.140
<v Speaker 3>abortion?</v>
<v Speaker 3>At what age is it?</v>

2410
01:35:36.141 --> 01:35:36.531
<v Speaker 3>Not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2411
01:35:36.531 --> 01:35:39.440
<v Speaker 3>Is it okay to abort a baby a day before </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's born?</v>

2412
01:35:39.650 --> 01:35:40.210
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2413
01:35:40.210 --> 01:35:41.870
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a but a month before?</v>

2414
01:35:42.110 --> 01:35:43.580
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How about two months before?</v>

2415
01:35:43.640 --> 01:35:44.600
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How about three?</v>

2416
01:35:44.750 --> 01:35:46.100
<v Speaker 3>How about four?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How about five?</v>

2417
01:35:46.220 --> 01:35:47.540
<v Speaker 3>How about six?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How about seven?</v>

2418
01:35:47.630 --> 01:35:48.650
<v Speaker 3>Where do we.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2419
01:35:49.010 --> 01:35:49.843
<v Speaker 3>Where do we get to the point where it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>not a baby and I think that's a viable </v>

2420
01:35:53.750 --> 01:35:57.200
<v Speaker 3>conversation and it's a real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very uncomfortable discussion.</v>

2421
01:35:57.530 --> 01:35:59.420
<v Speaker 3>As soon as you like me saying it right </v>
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>

2422
01:35:59.421 --> 01:36:01.730
<v Speaker 3>there's people listening to this right </v>
<v Speaker 3>now that are in their car.</v>

2423
01:36:01.880 --> 01:36:04.670
<v Speaker 3>Maybe there's a woman listening to this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's had an abortion and she's like,</v>

2424
01:36:04.671 --> 01:36:06.410
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to hear this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she wants to shut it off.</v>

2425
01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:07.393
<v Speaker 3>Maybe there's a guy who's trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>pressure his wife or girlfriend into </v>

2426
01:36:10.701 --> 01:36:12.440
<v Speaker 3>having an abortion and he doesn't want </v>
<v Speaker 3>to hear it,</v>

2427
01:36:12.680 --> 01:36:14.690
<v Speaker 3>but what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is abortion?</v>

2428
01:36:14.750 --> 01:36:15.360
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>

2429
01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:15.721
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2430
01:36:15.721 --> 01:36:16.350
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2431
01:36:16.350 --> 01:36:18.030
<v Speaker 2>and this is what I always call it the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2432
01:36:18.031 --> 01:36:20.390
<v Speaker 2>this issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me particularly joe is a 60 40 issue.</v>

2433
01:36:20.391 --> 01:36:22.380
<v Speaker 2>What I always say is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am pro choice,</v>

2434
01:36:22.890 --> 01:36:23.723
<v Speaker 2>but I respect the prolife argument and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't think you should just have </v>

2435
01:36:25.771 --> 01:36:27.990
<v Speaker 2>unfettered access to abortions forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2436
01:36:27.991 --> 01:36:28.500
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2437
01:36:28.500 --> 01:36:29.333
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2438
01:36:29.400 --> 01:36:30.780
<v Speaker 2>Two months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2439
01:36:30.900 --> 01:36:31.830
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fourteen week,</v>

2440
01:36:31.831 --> 01:36:33.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the number would be,</v>

2441
01:36:33.011 --> 01:36:34.760
<v Speaker 2>what the number is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fourteen weeks to months,</v>

2442
01:36:35.330 --> 01:36:36.091
<v Speaker 2>but to me I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2443
01:36:36.091 --> 01:36:38.550
<v Speaker 2>what's happened when you make a great </v>
<v Speaker 2>point?</v>

2444
01:36:38.580 --> 01:36:39.413
<v Speaker 2>Because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2445
01:36:39.420 --> 01:36:42.480
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is this dogmatic sense of saying like</v>

2446
01:36:42.540 --> 01:36:43.860
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the way it is.</v>

2447
01:36:44.220 --> 01:36:45.450
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It goes back to the,</v>

2448
01:36:45.451 --> 01:36:46.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard you talking about it.</v>

2449
01:36:46.351 --> 01:36:48.150
<v Speaker 2>I was so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was so glad to hear you say it because</v>

2450
01:36:49.170 --> 01:36:51.450
<v Speaker 2>it goes back to like the war on women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2451
01:36:51.630 --> 01:36:54.060
<v Speaker 2>Like there's just a whole group of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people apparently in the country,</v>

2452
01:36:54.061 --> 01:36:56.270
<v Speaker 2>a hundred 50 million of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate women that,</v>

2453
01:36:56.300 --> 01:36:58.560
<v Speaker 2>that because they're pro prolife for </v>
<v Speaker 2>instance,</v>

2454
01:36:58.561 --> 01:37:00.330
<v Speaker 2>which is a stance I don't share,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I respect.</v>

2455
01:37:01.290 --> 01:37:02.123
<v Speaker 2>Why does that mean that they hate women?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why does it mean that like why does it </v>

2456
01:37:03.601 --> 01:37:06.480
<v Speaker 2>always go from zero to 10 for like </v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately it's like.</v>

2457
01:37:06.630 --> 01:37:09.030
<v Speaker 2>And then there's all these lies mixed in</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the um,</v>

2458
01:37:09.260 --> 01:37:09.901
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2459
01:37:09.901 --> 01:37:10.770
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pay gap,</v>

2460
01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:13.680
<v Speaker 2>which is a fucking lie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just lie.</v>

2461
01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:17.140
<v Speaker 3>It's not just a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot is perpetrated by Obama on TV</v>

2462
01:37:17.170 --> 01:37:18.250
<v Speaker 3>talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2463
01:37:19.150 --> 01:37:19.983
<v Speaker 3>it's such a</v>

2464
01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:22.150
<v Speaker 2>confusing lie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just bizarre.</v>

2465
01:37:22.151 --> 01:37:25.870
<v Speaker 2>It is demonstrably false and it is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lie.</v>

2466
01:37:25.990 --> 01:37:27.520
<v Speaker 2>So why do I heat here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Keep it.</v>

2467
01:37:27.700 --> 01:37:28.533
<v Speaker 2>Why does everyone want be so divisive?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do you want to add more fuel to the </v>

2468
01:37:30.191 --> 01:37:31.120
<v Speaker 2>fire when you can be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2469
01:37:31.370 --> 01:37:32.770
<v Speaker 2>maybe we have problem x,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Y,</v>

2470
01:37:32.771 --> 01:37:33.940
<v Speaker 2>and Z,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this isn't a problem.</v>

2471
01:37:33.941 --> 01:37:35.680
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw it again recently.</v>

2472
01:37:36.260 --> 01:37:37.093
<v Speaker 3>It was recently in the news.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody brought it up and it unchecked </v>

2473
01:37:39.141 --> 01:37:41.450
<v Speaker 3>and unchallenged.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just explain to people if there were,</v>

2474
01:37:41.451 --> 01:37:42.284
<v Speaker 3>because I've done it too many times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>explained to people what the real pay </v>

2475
01:37:44.301 --> 01:37:48.060
<v Speaker 3>gap is and what the issue is when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why it's using it incorrectly,</v>

2476
01:37:48.270 --> 01:37:49.103
<v Speaker 2>so the pay gap claimed by studies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess the Department of Labor or </v>

2477
01:37:51.691 --> 01:37:53.580
<v Speaker 2>something is twenty one cents or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

2478
01:37:53.581 --> 01:37:54.930
<v Speaker 2>So I was saying I think something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>70,</v>

2479
01:37:55.530 --> 01:37:57.960
<v Speaker 2>every dollar a man makes a woman makes </v>
<v Speaker 2>seventy nine cents.</v>

2480
01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:01.110
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Only if you take every man,</v>

2481
01:38:01.230 --> 01:38:04.440
<v Speaker 2>every woman take all of the money they </v>
<v Speaker 2>make and divided by the amount of men in</v>

2482
01:38:04.441 --> 01:38:07.670
<v Speaker 2>the amount of women doesn't take into </v>
<v Speaker 2>account a careers,</v>

2483
01:38:07.671 --> 01:38:09.050
<v Speaker 2>doesn't take into account personal </v>
<v Speaker 2>choices.</v>

2484
01:38:09.051 --> 01:38:11.090
<v Speaker 2>Women for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>leave the workforce to have families.</v>

2485
01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:12.193
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes men are gravitating towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>engineering or physics or things that </v>

2486
01:38:16.221 --> 01:38:17.540
<v Speaker 2>pay them a lot of money while women tend</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

2487
01:38:17.720 --> 01:38:18.553
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tend maybe towards psychology or </v>

2488
01:38:20.540 --> 01:38:21.373
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the argument is something like </v>

2489
01:38:22.551 --> 01:38:23.384
<v Speaker 2>nine out of the 10 top grossing career </v>
<v Speaker 2>choices are men dominated and nine out </v>

2490
01:38:26.901 --> 01:38:30.620
<v Speaker 2>of the 10 lowest Korea money making </v>
<v Speaker 2>career choices are actually dominated by</v>

2491
01:38:30.621 --> 01:38:30.890
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>

2492
01:38:30.890 --> 01:38:34.520
<v Speaker 2>I think the only exception there is </v>
<v Speaker 2>clergy which is dominated by men and so,</v>

2493
01:38:34.580 --> 01:38:35.413
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't adjust for any of these </v>

2494
01:38:36.441 --> 01:38:38.480
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so when you actually adjust for choices,</v>

2495
01:38:38.481 --> 01:38:39.314
<v Speaker 2>when you adjust for careers and </v>
<v Speaker 2>longevity and hours and all of these </v>

2496
01:38:42.141 --> 01:38:42.974
<v Speaker 2>things that are relevant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pay gap closes to something like </v>

2497
01:38:44.691 --> 01:38:45.524
<v Speaker 2>less than five cents and then there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>even arguments saying that those could </v>

2498
01:38:47.961 --> 01:38:48.794
<v Speaker 2>probably be explained away completely as</v>
<v Speaker 2>well depending on what I know Christina </v>

2499
01:38:51.560 --> 01:38:52.393
<v Speaker 2>Summers and some of the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of these people that know way more </v>

2500
01:38:52.881 --> 01:38:55.520
<v Speaker 2>about this and I do have videos about if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you actually dive in,</v>

2501
01:38:55.521 --> 01:38:57.830
<v Speaker 2>you probably can get rid of the entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>number completely,</v>

2502
01:38:58.160 --> 01:38:58.993
<v Speaker 2>but the the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the prosperous to say that the woman </v>

2503
01:39:01.401 --> 01:39:02.990
<v Speaker 2>makes seventy nine cents for every </v>
<v Speaker 2>dollar</v>

2504
01:39:03.510 --> 01:39:06.440
<v Speaker 3>peated ad nauseum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The real issue is there.</v>

2505
01:39:06.450 --> 01:39:11.200
<v Speaker 3>It's implying that two people working </v>
<v Speaker 3>alongside each other at the apple store,</v>

2506
01:39:11.880 --> 01:39:12.713
<v Speaker 3>the man is making $5 an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The woman is making seventy nine cents </v>

2507
01:39:15.701 --> 01:39:17.100
<v Speaker 3>an hour less.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2508
01:39:17.130 --> 01:39:19.810
<v Speaker 3>Than seventy nine cents per dollar less.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2509
01:39:19.880 --> 01:39:21.550
<v Speaker 2>It's just not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like significantly.</v>

2510
01:39:21.690 --> 01:39:23.180
<v Speaker 2>And I liked the argument because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>

2511
01:39:23.240 --> 01:39:25.140
<v Speaker 2>You know why not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why if that was true,</v>

2512
01:39:25.141 --> 01:39:26.390
<v Speaker 2>why wouldn't a corporation just hire </v>
<v Speaker 2>women?</v>

2513
01:39:27.080 --> 01:39:28.580
<v Speaker 3>Seventy nine percent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should say it right?</v>

2514
01:39:28.581 --> 01:39:30.970
<v Speaker 3>Seventy nine cents to every dollar the </v>
<v Speaker 3>manmade makes.</v>

2515
01:39:31.180 --> 01:39:32.013
<v Speaker 3>Just corporations would Holler,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hire women if they were just as </v>

2516
01:39:34.941 --> 01:39:36.380
<v Speaker 3>competent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just as skilled,</v>

2517
01:39:36.381 --> 01:39:37.214
<v Speaker 3>and it's not that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also men are more likely to die on </v>

2518
01:39:39.381 --> 01:39:40.214
<v Speaker 3>the job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Men will more likely to pick way more </v>

2519
01:39:42.981 --> 01:39:46.350
<v Speaker 3>dangerous careers like forest fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>forest firefighting,</v>

2520
01:39:46.400 --> 01:39:47.233
<v Speaker 3>whether it's a coal mining,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all those things are dominated by men </v>

2521
01:39:49.431 --> 01:39:51.890
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of people die and I'm law </v>
<v Speaker 3>enforcement of course,</v>

2522
01:39:52.340 --> 01:39:53.960
<v Speaker 3>who's A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch of issues with it,</v>

2523
01:39:53.961 --> 01:39:58.730
<v Speaker 3>but the problem is it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's spewed out as an indication that we</v>

2524
01:39:58.731 --> 01:39:59.564
<v Speaker 3>are an inherently sexist society and </v>
<v Speaker 3>whether or not you can find sexism in </v>

2525
01:40:03.381 --> 01:40:04.214
<v Speaker 3>our society,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you can do it absolutely </v>

2526
01:40:05.691 --> 01:40:07.280
<v Speaker 3>exists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just as racism exists,</v>

2527
01:40:07.700 --> 01:40:08.533
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it is nearly as much of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem as they're trying to pin it out </v>

2528
01:40:12.261 --> 01:40:13.094
<v Speaker 3>to me and I think there's a lot of other</v>
<v Speaker 3>factors involved in why men make more </v>

2529
01:40:15.861 --> 01:40:16.694
<v Speaker 3>money and one of them may be the demand </v>
<v Speaker 3>for a higher salary when they're being </v>

2530
01:40:20.901 --> 01:40:21.734
<v Speaker 3>hired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Better skills at negotiation or more </v>

2531
01:40:23.151 --> 01:40:23.984
<v Speaker 3>confidence in those sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 3>confrontations with employers or </v>

2532
01:40:26.691 --> 01:40:27.524
<v Speaker 3>negotiations with employers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a lot of factors but it </v>

2533
01:40:29.661 --> 01:40:34.040
<v Speaker 3>doesn't do anybody any good to repeat a </v>
<v Speaker 3>false statistic when it's provably false</v>

2534
01:40:34.190 --> 01:40:35.023
<v Speaker 3>and then when people find out that it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>false and then they lose confidence in </v>

2535
01:40:37.221 --> 01:40:38.450
<v Speaker 3>the information they're being given,</v>

2536
01:40:38.770 --> 01:40:40.330
<v Speaker 2>it it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also.</v>

2537
01:40:40.600 --> 01:40:41.433
<v Speaker 2>I think that's one half of the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>half of it is like what does it say </v>

2538
01:40:43.571 --> 01:40:45.160
<v Speaker 2>about a person that just continues to </v>
<v Speaker 2>say it anyway,</v>

2539
01:40:45.370 --> 01:40:46.630
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like at some point,</v>

2540
01:40:46.631 --> 01:40:47.910
<v Speaker 2>truth doesn't matter anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2541
01:40:48.030 --> 01:40:51.280
<v Speaker 2>Like I want to have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to have factual debates.</v>

2542
01:40:51.281 --> 01:40:52.960
<v Speaker 2>I want to have like this is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>starting,</v>

2543
01:40:53.170 --> 01:40:55.990
<v Speaker 2>these are objective truths and then less</v>
<v Speaker 2>debate about those things.</v>

2544
01:40:56.100 --> 01:40:57.340
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if that's your starting point,</v>

2545
01:40:57.341 --> 01:40:58.174
<v Speaker 2>if that's like a third of the entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason why you're angry and in the </v>

2546
01:41:00.131 --> 01:41:00.964
<v Speaker 2>streets in Washington DC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well then I don't even know what you're </v>

2547
01:41:03.101 --> 01:41:04.840
<v Speaker 2>angry about anymore to be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the same.</v>

2548
01:41:04.841 --> 01:41:07.360
<v Speaker 2>It goes back to like occupy Wall Street </v>
<v Speaker 2>or all these things where I'm like,</v>

2549
01:41:07.420 --> 01:41:10.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't know exactly what you're angry </v>
<v Speaker 2>about and this is why this,</v>

2550
01:41:10.321 --> 01:41:12.580
<v Speaker 2>this protest isn't working and isn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>resonating with.</v>

2551
01:41:12.590 --> 01:41:12.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2552
01:41:12.870 --> 01:41:13.703
<v Speaker 3>I saw people in the march for women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the women's march thing with signs </v>

2553
01:41:17.070 --> 01:41:22.070
<v Speaker 3>talking about the gender pay gap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they had the time to make a sign.</v>

2554
01:41:23.010 --> 01:41:23.843
<v Speaker 3>They had the time to take that sign and </v>
<v Speaker 3>nail it to some boards and carry it </v>

2555
01:41:27.721 --> 01:41:28.554
<v Speaker 3>around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they didn't have time to Google </v>

2556
01:41:30.690 --> 01:41:32.650
<v Speaker 3>whether or not that was true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

2557
01:41:33.030 --> 01:41:33.863
<v Speaker 3>this fascinating.</v>

2558
01:41:33.900 --> 01:41:34.733
<v Speaker 2>That's also fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I feel like some of them have to </v>

2559
01:41:36.631 --> 01:41:37.050
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

2560
01:41:37.050 --> 01:41:38.910
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of them they don't want to know,</v>

2561
01:41:38.911 --> 01:41:41.430
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like I've read this thing once that</v>

2562
01:41:41.431 --> 01:41:44.790
<v Speaker 3>said that a sperm cures depression in </v>
<v Speaker 3>women.</v>

2563
01:41:45.780 --> 01:41:46.613
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even look any further on micro </v>

2564
01:41:48.330 --> 01:41:49.660
<v Speaker 3>got all the information I need.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>

2565
01:41:50.030 --> 01:41:55.030
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to just debunk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to be rock solid in my approach,</v>

2566
01:41:55.410 --> 01:41:57.090
<v Speaker 3>shut the laptop and walked out of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>room.</v>

2567
01:41:57.270 --> 01:41:58.500
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's really what's going on.</v>

2568
01:41:58.501 --> 01:41:59.820
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that sounds great.</v>

2569
01:41:59.821 --> 01:42:00.654
<v Speaker 3>If women make seventy nine cents to </v>
<v Speaker 3>every dollar man makes it sounds </v>

2570
01:42:02.401 --> 01:42:04.650
<v Speaker 3>awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a bullshit society.</v>

2571
01:42:04.651 --> 01:42:06.150
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the patriarchy.</v>

2572
01:42:06.590 --> 01:42:07.261
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Patriarchy.</v>

2573
01:42:07.261 --> 01:42:08.400
<v Speaker 2>Patriarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Patriarchy.</v>

2574
01:42:08.401 --> 01:42:09.300
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you asked them,</v>

2575
01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:09.951
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2576
01:42:09.951 --> 01:42:10.940
<v Speaker 2>you ask,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2577
01:42:10.941 --> 01:42:12.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of these feminists,</v>

2578
01:42:12.460 --> 01:42:13.750
<v Speaker 2>there's a reason with feminism if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

2579
01:42:13.780 --> 01:42:14.613
<v Speaker 2>if the goal is for total equality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we all know that that's now where </v>

2580
01:42:16.881 --> 01:42:19.400
<v Speaker 2>really what feminism means to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2581
01:42:19.500 --> 01:42:20.333
<v Speaker 2>if you sit there and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you name just one thing that I can </v>

2582
01:42:22.261 --> 01:42:23.990
<v Speaker 2>do that you can't just one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2583
01:42:24.010 --> 01:42:24.630
<v Speaker 2>like one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2584
01:42:24.630 --> 01:42:25.463
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not saying like you give birth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can or something like something </v>

2585
01:42:26.821 --> 01:42:27.654
<v Speaker 2>biological.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying like,</v>

2586
01:42:28.230 --> 01:42:30.300
<v Speaker 2>what can't you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2587
01:42:30.330 --> 01:42:32.760
<v Speaker 2>like if you really want it to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that,</v>

2588
01:42:32.761 --> 01:42:34.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I,</v>

2589
01:42:34.050 --> 01:42:37.080
<v Speaker 2>I know for instance that um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2590
01:42:37.550 --> 01:42:38.480
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2591
01:42:38.760 --> 01:42:40.470
<v Speaker 2>the examples that people give,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I haven't seen the statistics,</v>

2592
01:42:40.471 --> 01:42:41.910
<v Speaker 2>but I've heard it circulated that even </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2593
01:42:41.911 --> 01:42:44.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>companies are so desperate to hire women</v>

2594
01:42:44.041 --> 01:42:46.350
<v Speaker 2>because of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this situation,</v>

2595
01:42:46.351 --> 01:42:47.184
<v Speaker 2>this optical situation that they're in </v>
<v Speaker 2>where it seems like women are being </v>

2596
01:42:49.470 --> 01:42:51.480
<v Speaker 2>pushed down that women in their twenties</v>
<v Speaker 2>and thirties,</v>

2597
01:42:51.481 --> 01:42:52.530
<v Speaker 2>we're actually making more now.</v>

2598
01:42:52.680 --> 01:42:53.970
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're certainly,</v>

2599
01:42:53.971 --> 01:42:55.370
<v Speaker 2>they're more likely to get a higher </v>
<v Speaker 2>education.</v>

2600
01:42:55.380 --> 01:42:57.540
<v Speaker 2>Certainly they're more likely be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2601
01:42:57.810 --> 01:42:58.643
<v Speaker 2>even graduate high school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there are actually systemic benefits </v>

2602
01:43:01.500 --> 01:43:03.660
<v Speaker 2>to being a woman and there's nothing </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily wrong with that either.</v>

2603
01:43:03.960 --> 01:43:06.000
<v Speaker 2>But I just feel like it goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>goes back to that thing of like,</v>

2604
01:43:06.001 --> 01:43:07.350
<v Speaker 2>why are we fighting?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2605
01:43:07.351 --> 01:43:09.000
<v Speaker 2>what is the divisive nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't we.</v>

2606
01:43:09.180 --> 01:43:10.800
<v Speaker 2>And this goes back to your question </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the video game industry.</v>

2607
01:43:10.801 --> 01:43:11.581
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2608
01:43:11.581 --> 01:43:14.100
<v Speaker 2>instead of yelling at me about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we won't agree about this,</v>

2609
01:43:14.190 --> 01:43:17.310
<v Speaker 2>these situations over here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but can we advocate for these together?</v>

2610
01:43:17.700 --> 01:43:18.533
<v Speaker 2>Or do you not want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wanna you wanna you don't want my </v>

2611
01:43:19.711 --> 01:43:23.190
<v Speaker 2>advocacy for gay marriage because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe in small government,</v>

2612
01:43:23.370 --> 01:43:25.870
<v Speaker 2>you all my advocacy for a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2613
01:43:26.040 --> 01:43:28.260
<v Speaker 2>transgender rights because I'm for low </v>
<v Speaker 2>taxes,</v>

2614
01:43:28.580 --> 01:43:29.670
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2615
01:43:29.671 --> 01:43:30.504
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's weird because we can totally be </v>

2616
01:43:31.261 --> 01:43:34.320
<v Speaker 2>friends here with the women's March.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that there were problems with pro</v>

2617
01:43:34.380 --> 01:43:37.140
<v Speaker 2>life organizations getting involved at a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sponsorship level even.</v>

2618
01:43:37.220 --> 01:43:39.500
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2619
01:43:40.230 --> 01:43:43.090
<v Speaker 2>it's like they're not women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>

2620
01:43:43.130 --> 01:43:43.571
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

2621
01:43:43.571 --> 01:43:45.240
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're lesser than debate</v>

2622
01:43:45.240 --> 01:43:46.420
<v Speaker 3>about that one issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2623
01:43:46.850 --> 01:43:47.683
<v Speaker 3>Strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You said something that I want to go </v>

2624
01:43:48.991 --> 01:43:51.120
<v Speaker 3>back to what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you think feminism is about?</v>

2625
01:43:52.090 --> 01:43:53.740
<v Speaker 2>What's his argument about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about equality?</v>

2626
01:43:54.170 --> 01:43:55.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>

2627
01:43:55.120 --> 01:43:58.600
<v Speaker 2>feminism was about equality and I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that this,</v>

2628
01:43:58.630 --> 01:43:59.291
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2629
01:43:59.291 --> 01:44:00.124
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm reading more about it and learning </v>

2630
01:44:00.641 --> 01:44:02.200
<v Speaker 2>more about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm still very ignorant about it.</v>

2631
01:44:02.201 --> 01:44:03.640
<v Speaker 2>But this third wave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they call it,</v>

2632
01:44:03.641 --> 01:44:05.230
<v Speaker 2>third wave feminism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I'm sure is a term you've heard,</v>

2633
01:44:05.590 --> 01:44:10.420
<v Speaker 2>that seems to be more about a combative </v>
<v Speaker 2>nature to actually,</v>

2634
01:44:10.950 --> 01:44:11.783
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of like saying like men and </v>

2635
01:44:12.461 --> 01:44:13.294
<v Speaker 2>women are equal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>men and women should deserve the same </v>

2636
01:44:14.111 --> 01:44:15.910
<v Speaker 2>rights and the same treatment and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>those kinds of things.</v>

2637
01:44:15.911 --> 01:44:18.940
<v Speaker 2>It's actually seems to be very anti man </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a way.</v>

2638
01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.490
<v Speaker 2>Like it seems to be very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like almost like the tables have turned,</v>

2639
01:44:21.640 --> 01:44:22.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like,</v>

2640
01:44:22.481 --> 01:44:25.160
<v Speaker 2>well why are you turning the tables like</v>
<v Speaker 2>we didn't have you achieve what you want</v>

2641
01:44:25.161 --> 01:44:25.994
<v Speaker 2>in like in the first place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was just that we were going to be </v>

2642
01:44:28.330 --> 01:44:29.930
<v Speaker 2>here together at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2643
01:44:30.030 --> 01:44:31.030
<v Speaker 2>at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the,</v>

2644
01:44:31.060 --> 01:44:33.070
<v Speaker 2>at the nexus of everything as two </v>
<v Speaker 2>genders.</v>

2645
01:44:33.590 --> 01:44:37.490
<v Speaker 3>Problem is that reinforcing that fake </v>
<v Speaker 3>statistic,</v>

2646
01:44:37.940 --> 01:44:38.773
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the gender pay gap that so many people </v>

2647
01:44:40.641 --> 01:44:41.474
<v Speaker 3>have heard that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Sarah Silverman was just talking </v>

2648
01:44:42.711 --> 01:44:45.020
<v Speaker 3>about a recently and some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some big thing that she did.</v>

2649
01:44:45.050 --> 01:44:46.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not true,</v>

2650
01:44:46.791 --> 01:44:49.490
<v Speaker 3>but yet people just say it and no one </v>
<v Speaker 3>stops them from Santa.</v>

2651
01:44:49.520 --> 01:44:51.770
<v Speaker 3>A friend of mine that was a very </v>
<v Speaker 3>educated guy said it,</v>

2652
01:44:52.010 --> 01:44:56.700
<v Speaker 3>we were having a debate about a divorce </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he brought it up and I was like,</v>

2653
01:44:56.780 --> 01:44:57.613
<v Speaker 3>that's not even true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and unfortunately we're in a place with </v>

2654
01:44:59.751 --> 01:45:00.584
<v Speaker 3>no cell phone reception,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I had to wait until we got back to </v>

2655
01:45:02.331 --> 01:45:04.460
<v Speaker 3>send it to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this is not true.</v>

2656
01:45:04.490 --> 01:45:07.640
<v Speaker 3>Like what you're saying is not true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're repeating it as if you know,</v>

2657
01:45:07.850 --> 01:45:09.890
<v Speaker 3>but meanwhile you've done zero research </v>
<v Speaker 3>on it.</v>

2658
01:45:09.891 --> 01:45:10.724
<v Speaker 3>It's a talking point that just gets </v>
<v Speaker 3>reiterated over and over again without </v>

2659
01:45:12.921 --> 01:45:14.900
<v Speaker 3>any research and it's convenient.</v>

2660
01:45:14.930 --> 01:45:16.610
<v Speaker 3>It's convenient to reinforce your </v>
<v Speaker 3>argument.</v>

2661
01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:17.713
<v Speaker 3>It's a number.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a number that deals with a very </v>

2662
01:45:19.161 --> 01:45:19.994
<v Speaker 3>complex and nuanced debate and I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the idea of feminism is to me in a </v>

2663
01:45:27.471 --> 01:45:28.304
<v Speaker 3>lot of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very similar to the idea of the men's </v>

2664
01:45:30.201 --> 01:45:32.930
<v Speaker 3>rights movement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not opposed to rights for anybody.</v>

2665
01:45:32.990 --> 01:45:33.823
<v Speaker 3>I'm not opposed to anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm very egalitarianism ideas about the </v>

2666
01:45:36.681 --> 01:45:37.514
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I am opposed to anybody that likes </v>

2667
01:45:40.101 --> 01:45:43.040
<v Speaker 3>one gender over the other because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think that's foolish.</v>

2668
01:45:43.041 --> 01:45:45.440
<v Speaker 3>Just like I'm opposed to people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>only like white people.</v>

2669
01:45:45.710 --> 01:45:47.930
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to pose to people that only </v>
<v Speaker 3>like black people,</v>

2670
01:45:48.110 --> 01:45:48.943
<v Speaker 3>I'm opposed to people that generalize </v>
<v Speaker 3>based on an enormous mass of human </v>

2671
01:45:53.271 --> 01:45:55.040
<v Speaker 3>beings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like men are shit,</v>

2672
01:45:55.190 --> 01:45:57.020
<v Speaker 3>women rule,</v>
<v Speaker 3>girls rule,</v>

2673
01:45:57.021 --> 01:45:58.420
<v Speaker 3>boys drool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2674
01:45:58.430 --> 01:46:00.170
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like it the other way either.</v>

2675
01:46:00.171 --> 01:46:02.240
<v Speaker 3>I don't like it that he man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>woman haters club.</v>

2676
01:46:02.241 --> 01:46:03.074
<v Speaker 3>I don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like any ideologies that lump </v>

2677
01:46:05.961 --> 01:46:08.750
<v Speaker 3>people into these huge groups because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think it's more on think.</v>

2678
01:46:09.050 --> 01:46:11.060
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a stupid way of looking at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>

2679
01:46:11.240 --> 01:46:11.871
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

2680
01:46:11.871 --> 01:46:12.231
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

2681
01:46:12.231 --> 01:46:14.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm the same way that the yellow tarian </v>
<v Speaker 2>nature is the best that the,</v>

2682
01:46:14.931 --> 01:46:15.740
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2683
01:46:15.740 --> 01:46:19.340
<v Speaker 2>live and let live nature to judge people</v>
<v Speaker 2>based on their character and the quality</v>

2684
01:46:19.341 --> 01:46:21.680
<v Speaker 2>of their intelligence or whatever it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're looking for in them.</v>

2685
01:46:22.250 --> 01:46:23.083
<v Speaker 2>Shouldn't be categorized in these </v>
<v Speaker 2>specific ways by sex or gender or by </v>

2686
01:46:26.450 --> 01:46:28.280
<v Speaker 2>race or religion by any of those kinds </v>
<v Speaker 2>of things.</v>

2687
01:46:28.281 --> 01:46:29.114
<v Speaker 2>I'm totally with you there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think we both agree that women </v>

2688
01:46:30.381 --> 01:46:31.760
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't be allowed to vote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2689
01:46:31.790 --> 01:46:32.181
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2690
01:46:32.181 --> 01:46:34.130
<v Speaker 2>I mean that was a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>women have suffered long enough,</v>

2691
01:46:34.360 --> 01:46:37.560
<v Speaker 2>enough already at girls I used to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to think that joke was so funny.</v>

2692
01:46:37.570 --> 01:46:38.403
<v Speaker 2>You want mean you get murdered for that </v>
<v Speaker 2>joke today with like the women's </v>

2693
01:46:40.080 --> 01:46:40.913
<v Speaker 2>suffrage suffragettes like women have </v>
<v Speaker 2>suffered long enough instead of </v>

2694
01:46:42.861 --> 01:46:43.790
<v Speaker 2>suffering whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

2695
01:46:44.060 --> 01:46:45.080
<v Speaker 2>it's a funny joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd probably,</v>

2696
01:46:45.270 --> 01:46:47.120
<v Speaker 2>that would've ruined my career to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on twitter,</v>

2697
01:46:47.121 --> 01:46:49.040
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it didn't ruin your career.</v>

2698
01:46:49.240 --> 01:46:51.460
<v Speaker 3>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gave you a platform.</v>

2699
01:46:51.520 --> 01:46:52.540
<v Speaker 3>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all,</v>

2700
01:46:52.541 --> 01:46:53.900
<v Speaker 3>it all balances out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's slow.</v>

2701
01:46:53.910 --> 01:46:56.620
<v Speaker 3>As long as you're being attacked for </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that's not valid,</v>

2702
01:46:56.910 --> 01:46:58.320
<v Speaker 2>it all balances out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just takes.</v>

2703
01:46:58.350 --> 01:47:00.120
<v Speaker 2>You take a little heat and then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>realize like,</v>

2704
01:47:00.150 --> 01:47:01.170
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm through that.</v>

2705
01:47:01.200 --> 01:47:02.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was scary for a little while.</v>

2706
01:47:02.560 --> 01:47:04.920
<v Speaker 2>It was scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if scary is the right word.</v>

2707
01:47:04.921 --> 01:47:05.340
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

2708
01:47:05.340 --> 01:47:07.770
<v Speaker 2>it was uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was uncomfortable and unsettling.</v>

2709
01:47:07.771 --> 01:47:09.750
<v Speaker 2>And you really saw where everyone stood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2710
01:47:09.751 --> 01:47:12.480
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things I was talking with </v>
<v Speaker 2>people about was,</v>

2711
01:47:12.510 --> 01:47:15.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how sad it was for me that no,</v>

2712
01:47:15.071 --> 01:47:15.904
<v Speaker 2>like very few people that I knew came to</v>
<v Speaker 2>my defense and I wasn't saying they had </v>

2713
01:47:18.001 --> 01:47:19.530
<v Speaker 2>to come to my defense and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2714
01:47:19.960 --> 01:47:21.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Collin,</v>

2715
01:47:21.450 --> 01:47:22.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that joke was fine.</v>

2716
01:47:22.921 --> 01:47:23.790
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you didn't like the joke,</v>

2717
01:47:23.791 --> 01:47:24.450
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care.</v>

2718
01:47:24.450 --> 01:47:26.310
<v Speaker 2>It's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jokes fall flat all the time.</v>

2719
01:47:26.311 --> 01:47:27.270
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're a comedian.</v>

2720
01:47:27.271 --> 01:47:28.104
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard.</v>

2721
01:47:28.160 --> 01:47:28.993
<v Speaker 2>I don't do it professionally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's impossibly hard to get on </v>

2722
01:47:30.721 --> 01:47:31.980
<v Speaker 2>the stage and do that kind of stuff.</v>

2723
01:47:32.010 --> 01:47:33.870
<v Speaker 2>But to me I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2724
01:47:33.871 --> 01:47:35.730
<v Speaker 2>is anyone going to say that I'm not a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexist?</v>

2725
01:47:35.820 --> 01:47:38.790
<v Speaker 2>Is anyone going to stand up that's known</v>
<v Speaker 2>me for 10 years and say like,</v>

2726
01:47:38.791 --> 01:47:40.350
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't agree with the joke,</v>

2727
01:47:40.351 --> 01:47:44.160
<v Speaker 2>but the way you're categorizing this guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>who I know is not accurate.</v>

2728
01:47:44.220 --> 01:47:45.053
<v Speaker 2>And I heard that there were some fights </v>
<v Speaker 2>behind the scenes with people and I got </v>

2729
01:47:47.821 --> 01:47:50.250
<v Speaker 2>a lot of DMZ messages but very little in</v>
<v Speaker 2>terms of public support.</v>

2730
01:47:50.251 --> 01:47:52.830
<v Speaker 2>And that really hurt me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that really,</v>

2731
01:47:53.100 --> 01:47:57.300
<v Speaker 2>really hurt me and wounded me in a deep </v>
<v Speaker 2>way and ruin friendships like that I had</v>

2732
01:47:57.360 --> 01:47:59.210
<v Speaker 2>for years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like fake friendship</v>

2733
01:47:59.370 --> 01:48:00.340
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

2734
01:48:00.341 --> 01:48:03.670
<v Speaker 3>and people probably felt the need to toe</v>
<v Speaker 3>the line,</v>

2735
01:48:04.020 --> 01:48:04.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>toe this,</v>

2736
01:48:04.890 --> 01:48:05.723
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to say party line,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the ideological ideological line </v>

2737
01:48:09.370 --> 01:48:10.203
<v Speaker 3>mean the dogmatic line if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you run into someone who is in any </v>

2738
01:48:16.001 --> 01:48:16.834
<v Speaker 3>way involved in any sort of a dispute </v>
<v Speaker 3>that makes that person appear to be a </v>

2739
01:48:19.841 --> 01:48:21.340
<v Speaker 3>sexist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're supposed to pile on.</v>

2740
01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:22.391
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2741
01:48:22.391 --> 01:48:22.731
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2742
01:48:22.731 --> 01:48:23.564
<v Speaker 2>and that's exactly what they did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the thing that hurt me the most is </v>

2743
01:48:25.171 --> 01:48:26.004
<v Speaker 2>that I didn't expect it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not close with a lot of these </v>

2744
01:48:27.631 --> 01:48:28.860
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people that know me,</v>

2745
01:48:29.250 --> 01:48:30.083
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are people in this industry that </v>

2746
01:48:30.811 --> 01:48:35.160
<v Speaker 2>are writing that we're piling on me or </v>
<v Speaker 2>remaining silent that got freelance work</v>

2747
01:48:35.161 --> 01:48:35.994
<v Speaker 2>because of me that got maybe even got </v>
<v Speaker 2>hired because I was on a hiring </v>

2748
01:48:38.011 --> 01:48:38.821
<v Speaker 2>committee that put,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2749
01:48:38.821 --> 01:48:40.180
<v Speaker 2>push for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2750
01:48:40.350 --> 01:48:41.183
<v Speaker 2>all of these kinds of things that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>used to take out to lunch when I was </v>

2751
01:48:42.901 --> 01:48:44.130
<v Speaker 2>senior editor to see how they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>

2752
01:48:44.131 --> 01:48:45.990
<v Speaker 2>if there's anything I can do for them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that.</v>

2753
01:48:45.991 --> 01:48:47.760
<v Speaker 2>And everyone's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2754
01:48:48.040 --> 01:48:49.680
<v Speaker 2>not going to stay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to come back and help help</v>

2755
01:48:49.681 --> 01:48:50.514
<v Speaker 2>him out now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I tried to put that good energy out </v>

2756
01:48:51.931 --> 01:48:52.020
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

2757
01:48:52.020 --> 01:48:52.853
<v Speaker 2>I'm not always full of good energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I say negative things or bad </v>

2758
01:48:54.271 --> 01:48:55.530
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes they make mistakes,</v>

2759
01:48:55.770 --> 01:48:57.930
<v Speaker 2>but when it comes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when a person comes after your character</v>

2760
01:48:58.200 --> 01:49:02.280
<v Speaker 2>and you damn well know that there are a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of people around you that know who</v>

2761
01:49:02.281 --> 01:49:03.114
<v Speaker 2>you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether or not they agree with what you </v>

2762
01:49:03.721 --> 01:49:06.570
<v Speaker 2>said or agree with what you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they know you're who you are.</v>

2763
01:49:06.571 --> 01:49:07.404
<v Speaker 2>And they know the severity of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are saying and they don't say </v>

2764
01:49:09.601 --> 01:49:14.310
<v Speaker 2>anything that really wounds a person and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that really fucking hurt.</v>

2765
01:49:14.340 --> 01:49:15.173
<v Speaker 2>Do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think</v>

2766
01:49:15.200 --> 01:49:19.670
<v Speaker 3>that what's going on and a lot of ways </v>
<v Speaker 3>when people did not come to your defense</v>

2767
01:49:19.940 --> 01:49:22.800
<v Speaker 3>is that what you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2768
01:49:22.910 --> 01:49:23.743
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in many ways is making a very </v>

2769
01:49:25.821 --> 01:49:30.821
<v Speaker 3>complicated and nuanced perspective from</v>
<v Speaker 3>a person in your,</v>

2770
01:49:31.851 --> 01:49:32.740
<v Speaker 3>in your stance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

2771
01:49:32.741 --> 01:49:34.220
<v Speaker 3>you're kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

2772
01:49:34.350 --> 01:49:35.780
<v Speaker 3>you're taking this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

2773
01:49:36.550 --> 01:49:37.383
<v Speaker 3>this path outside of the ideology and by</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing so you sort of challenge a lot of </v>

2774
01:49:44.271 --> 01:49:48.040
<v Speaker 3>the ways these people have been behaving</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a long time and as soon as you do</v>

2775
01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:48.873
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to kind of reconsider these </v>

2776
01:49:49.721 --> 01:49:50.554
<v Speaker 1>ideological boundaries that you've set </v>
<v Speaker 1>up and their own behavior and thinking </v>

2777
01:49:53.441 --> 01:49:56.710
<v Speaker 1>and communication and that they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to do that and they,</v>

2778
01:49:56.711 --> 01:49:59.350
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like to keep things rigid and simple and</v>

2779
01:49:59.470 --> 01:50:01.990
<v Speaker 1>they also want to continue to progress </v>
<v Speaker 1>in their career.</v>

2780
01:50:02.200 --> 01:50:03.033
<v Speaker 1>And in order to do that you have to kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of like have this predetermined pattern </v>

2781
01:50:07.331 --> 01:50:08.164
<v Speaker 1>that you follow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think simple is the key word that </v>

2782
01:50:10.460 --> 01:50:11.293
<v Speaker 1>simple because yes they can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are people out there that can not </v>

2783
01:50:14.081 --> 01:50:17.290
<v Speaker 1>comprehend how a person who believes in </v>
<v Speaker 1>small government,</v>

2784
01:50:17.291 --> 01:50:18.124
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll use the same argument that says </v>

2785
01:50:20.540 --> 01:50:21.373
<v Speaker 1>the government can't touch my guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's consistent with saying the </v>

2786
01:50:23.891 --> 01:50:24.724
<v Speaker 1>government can't tell a woman what to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>with her body that's consistent with </v>

2787
01:50:26.981 --> 01:50:27.491
<v Speaker 1>principle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says,</v>

2788
01:50:27.491 --> 01:50:28.324
<v Speaker 1>I'm a government shouldn't even be </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in telling you who you can </v>

2789
01:50:30.131 --> 01:50:30.850
<v Speaker 1>marry in the mannequin.</v>

2790
01:50:30.850 --> 01:50:31.683
<v Speaker 1>Could she be able to marry a man and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman should be able to marry a woman </v>

2791
01:50:32.830 --> 01:50:36.010
<v Speaker 1>and I would go as far as to say that </v>
<v Speaker 1>even a polygamist totally on the,</v>

2792
01:50:36.060 --> 01:50:37.440
<v Speaker 1>on the up and up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's in on it.</v>

2793
01:50:37.450 --> 01:50:39.100
<v Speaker 1>Relationship should not be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>

2794
01:50:39.140 --> 01:50:39.973
<v Speaker 1>The that of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they cannot acknowledge that it's the </v>

2795
01:50:42.791 --> 01:50:44.830
<v Speaker 1>lack of governmental power that gives </v>
<v Speaker 1>you that.</v>

2796
01:50:44.831 --> 01:50:45.790
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In my perspective,</v>

2797
01:50:46.060 --> 01:50:49.110
<v Speaker 1>when they feel like it's the wielding of</v>
<v Speaker 1>government power that ensures those,</v>

2798
01:50:49.190 --> 01:50:50.830
<v Speaker 1>those rights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not the.</v>

2799
01:50:50.930 --> 01:50:52.770
<v Speaker 1>That's not congruent with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't understand how the how,</v>

2800
01:50:52.840 --> 01:50:53.673
<v Speaker 1>how.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't understand how we came to the </v>

2801
01:50:55.241 --> 01:50:56.074
<v Speaker 1>same exact conclusion by going just </v>
<v Speaker 1>totally two different directions and </v>

2802
01:50:58.301 --> 01:50:59.134
<v Speaker 1>that really that challenges them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have the philosophical </v>

2803
01:51:00.641 --> 01:51:03.220
<v Speaker 1>boundary bounding to figure out how that</v>
<v Speaker 1>might be.</v>

2804
01:51:03.370 --> 01:51:03.610
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2805
01:51:03.610 --> 01:51:04.443
<v Speaker 1>that's the argument that the philosophy </v>
<v Speaker 1>has to be bound in writing has to be </v>

2806
01:51:07.481 --> 01:51:09.370
<v Speaker 1>bound in some sort of a doctrine.</v>

2807
01:51:09.370 --> 01:51:13.210
<v Speaker 1>It has to be written down on paper and </v>
<v Speaker 1>established and enforced by a government</v>

2808
01:51:13.780 --> 01:51:15.580
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like a big daddy thing,</v>

2809
01:51:15.820 --> 01:51:17.350
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean instead of saying,</v>

2810
01:51:17.410 --> 01:51:18.243
<v Speaker 1>give the power to the people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let people do whatever they would like </v>

2811
01:51:20.231 --> 01:51:23.440
<v Speaker 1>to do as long as they're not infringing </v>
<v Speaker 1>upon the rights of others and let's have</v>

2812
01:51:23.441 --> 01:51:26.680
<v Speaker 1>less and less people dictating what </v>
<v Speaker 1>people get to do.</v>

2813
01:51:27.120 --> 01:51:27.730
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

2814
01:51:27.730 --> 01:51:31.550
<v Speaker 1>that to me is liberty and they and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at it or I don't want to say that,</v>

2815
01:51:31.551 --> 01:51:32.384
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of progressives are regressives </v>

2816
01:51:33.561 --> 01:51:34.410
<v Speaker 1>men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They only want to look at them.</v>

2817
01:51:34.510 --> 01:51:35.440
<v Speaker 1>We'll look at it and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2818
01:51:35.441 --> 01:51:37.780
<v Speaker 1>the government has one shared these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things because these are not natural.</v>

2819
01:51:38.170 --> 01:51:40.660
<v Speaker 1>These are not natural rights are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are not things that can be insured</v>

2820
01:51:40.661 --> 01:51:41.494
<v Speaker 1>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the national society and the </v>

2821
01:51:43.481 --> 01:51:46.330
<v Speaker 1>natural sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to have a consistent rights.</v>

2822
01:51:46.720 --> 01:51:47.553
<v Speaker 1>I can't in good faith say like I have </v>
<v Speaker 1>the right to wield a gun because the </v>

2823
01:51:51.251 --> 01:51:52.084
<v Speaker 1>government can't tell me that even </v>
<v Speaker 1>though it's enshrined in the bill of </v>

2824
01:51:53.051 --> 01:51:53.860
<v Speaker 1>rights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then say like,</v>

2825
01:51:53.860 --> 01:51:54.693
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the government can get involved in your </v>

2826
01:51:55.121 --> 01:51:57.490
<v Speaker 1>bedroom though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of the garment can tap your phone.</v>

2827
01:51:57.520 --> 01:51:58.300
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the government.</v>

2828
01:51:58.300 --> 01:51:58.751
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2829
01:51:58.751 --> 01:52:00.670
<v Speaker 1>it's either all or nothing and if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and if,</v>

2830
01:52:00.690 --> 01:52:01.523
<v Speaker 1>if that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that's a philosophy that's too hard </v>

2831
01:52:02.471 --> 01:52:05.500
<v Speaker 1>for people to wrap their minds around </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know what to say about that,</v>

2832
01:52:05.501 --> 01:52:06.334
<v Speaker 1>but to me it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's to me it's pretty clear and pretty </v>

2833
01:52:07.601 --> 01:52:08.434
<v Speaker 1>lucid the way I feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My principals are rooted in that </v>

2834
01:52:10.150 --> 01:52:11.290
<v Speaker 1>philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also.</v>

2835
01:52:11.291 --> 01:52:12.124
<v Speaker 1>I think when people there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're seeking this sort of comfort </v>

2836
01:52:14.171 --> 01:52:17.700
<v Speaker 1>level in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in life and in,</v>

2837
01:52:17.730 --> 01:52:18.563
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in their positions and I don't </v>

2838
01:52:19.931 --> 01:52:20.764
<v Speaker 1>necessarily think people understand that</v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as you allow the government to </v>

2839
01:52:23.651 --> 01:52:26.230
<v Speaker 1>much power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will never get that back.</v>

2840
01:52:26.740 --> 01:52:27.573
<v Speaker 1>As soon as they have power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as they can take away some of </v>

2841
01:52:30.011 --> 01:52:30.844
<v Speaker 1>your liberties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those will never get returned or one of </v>

2842
01:52:32.561 --> 01:52:35.350
<v Speaker 1>the rare ones is marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a really.</v>

2843
01:52:35.390 --> 01:52:35.751
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>

2844
01:52:35.751 --> 01:52:37.660
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to explain to someone the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other day about this,</v>

2845
01:52:37.661 --> 01:52:42.250
<v Speaker 1>like it's incredibly rare that something</v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes legal that was illegal.</v>

2846
01:52:42.251 --> 01:52:44.200
<v Speaker 1>As long as marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very rare,</v>

2847
01:52:44.350 --> 01:52:46.160
<v Speaker 1>like something has be in a just</v>

2848
01:52:46.180 --> 01:52:51.180
<v Speaker 3>completely undeniably good for it to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have gone through all the propaganda,</v>

2849
01:52:52.461 --> 01:52:53.840
<v Speaker 3>all the bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the lies,</v>

2850
01:52:53.841 --> 01:52:54.674
<v Speaker 3>all the governmental regulations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the people being locked up in jail </v>

2851
01:52:57.171 --> 01:52:58.004
<v Speaker 3>for life or and then still come out the </v>
<v Speaker 3>other side on 2017 and be legal and a </v>

2852
01:53:02.121 --> 01:53:04.320
<v Speaker 3>bunch of states recreationally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2853
01:53:04.340 --> 01:53:05.900
<v Speaker 3>Not even just medically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's great to see,</v>

2854
01:53:06.110 --> 01:53:10.880
<v Speaker 3>but it's fascinating because it's one of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rare instances where liberty last is</v>

2855
01:53:10.881 --> 01:53:14.290
<v Speaker 3>regained and most of the time it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just not.</v>

2856
01:53:14.350 --> 01:53:15.183
<v Speaker 2>It's an aberration and that's what </v>
<v Speaker 2>people have to be really scared of and </v>

2857
01:53:16.931 --> 01:53:17.711
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That goes to the point.</v>

2858
01:53:17.711 --> 01:53:18.544
<v Speaker 2>It's like I don't want to give anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>an inch because I am afraid of the </v>

2859
01:53:21.281 --> 01:53:22.114
<v Speaker 2>consequences of giving anyone an inch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I wouldn't apologize for the </v>

2860
01:53:23.951 --> 01:53:24.784
<v Speaker 2>joke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why I resigned from my company </v>

2861
01:53:25.781 --> 01:53:27.400
<v Speaker 2>instead of apologizing for the joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2862
01:53:27.401 --> 01:53:30.160
<v Speaker 2>Could you apologize for that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So first of all,</v>

2863
01:53:30.161 --> 01:53:33.690
<v Speaker 2>it's a honeymooners married with </v>
<v Speaker 2>children all in the family level jokes,</v>

2864
01:53:33.691 --> 01:53:37.570
<v Speaker 2>something you'd see on the floor of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>CBS writers room and it and,</v>

2865
01:53:37.870 --> 01:53:38.703
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the point is that I could have </v>

2866
01:53:39.401 --> 01:53:41.950
<v Speaker 2>probably apologizing for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm like,</v>

2867
01:53:42.490 --> 01:53:44.230
<v Speaker 2>no because a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sorry.</v>

2868
01:53:44.231 --> 01:53:48.550
<v Speaker 2>So that'll be a huge lie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be Like I have to now really recalibrate</v>

2869
01:53:48.551 --> 01:53:50.180
<v Speaker 2>the way I go about my business with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2870
01:53:50.210 --> 01:53:51.820
<v Speaker 2>with my partners and with the audience </v>
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>

2871
01:53:52.780 --> 01:53:53.613
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have the protections that I </v>

2872
01:53:54.881 --> 01:53:57.160
<v Speaker 2>thought I would have when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the mistake was made,</v>

2873
01:53:57.161 --> 01:53:59.080
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I didn't and that was what hurt me.</v>

2874
01:53:59.081 --> 01:53:59.914
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried to do what I thought was the </v>

2875
01:54:01.991 --> 01:54:04.540
<v Speaker 2>most principled and character driven </v>
<v Speaker 2>choice which would be like,</v>

2876
01:54:04.541 --> 01:54:06.790
<v Speaker 2>this is best for my partners who don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>agree with me.</v>

2877
01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:08.560
<v Speaker 2>This is best for the audience who might </v>
<v Speaker 2>not agree with me.</v>

2878
01:54:08.561 --> 01:54:09.394
<v Speaker 2>It seems like a lot of them do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is the best for just everyone </v>

2879
01:54:11.681 --> 01:54:12.514
<v Speaker 2>moving forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll have other opportunities and other </v>

2880
01:54:13.841 --> 01:54:14.630
<v Speaker 2>things that I can do.</v>

2881
01:54:14.630 --> 01:54:16.550
<v Speaker 3>Has it been any blowback,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2882
01:54:16.950 --> 01:54:19.320
<v Speaker 3>targeted towards the people that were </v>
<v Speaker 3>upset at you?</v>

2883
01:54:19.480 --> 01:54:21.140
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2884
01:54:21.280 --> 01:54:22.650
<v Speaker 2>and the thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2885
01:54:22.700 --> 01:54:23.533
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sad to see because it's not in my </v>

2886
01:54:25.040 --> 01:54:25.873
<v Speaker 2>eye.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I'm a pretty good natured </v>

2887
01:54:26.411 --> 01:54:29.560
<v Speaker 2>person and I don't like CP seeing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>rubber band effect going on where people</v>

2888
01:54:29.561 --> 01:54:32.200
<v Speaker 2>now are suffering because they stood up </v>
<v Speaker 2>and stood out or whatever.</v>

2889
01:54:32.470 --> 01:54:33.303
<v Speaker 2>It's just that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't care about the people that </v>

2890
01:54:34.211 --> 01:54:36.070
<v Speaker 2>were out to character assassinate me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about like,</v>

2891
01:54:36.150 --> 01:54:37.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my and my business partners and stuff.</v>

2892
01:54:38.140 --> 01:54:40.420
<v Speaker 2>It's just that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter what I say will be twisted.</v>

2893
01:54:40.600 --> 01:54:41.433
<v Speaker 2>I tried to be very magnanimous and like </v>
<v Speaker 2>very kind about it when I was on Ruben </v>

2894
01:54:43.981 --> 01:54:47.110
<v Speaker 2>the second time and people twisted </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything to just be a problem anyway.</v>

2895
01:54:47.111 --> 01:54:47.944
<v Speaker 2>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just remain silent because I'd </v>

2896
01:54:48.701 --> 01:54:51.100
<v Speaker 2>rather than misconstrue the silence that</v>
<v Speaker 2>misconstrue the words,</v>

2897
01:54:51.101 --> 01:54:52.460
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2898
01:54:52.910 --> 01:54:53.400
<v Speaker 2>is that</v>

2899
01:54:53.400 --> 01:54:54.240
<v Speaker 3>problem?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2900
01:54:54.241 --> 01:54:55.130
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

2901
01:54:55.140 --> 01:54:55.973
<v Speaker 3>if you're not communicating freely and </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're worried about the </v>

2902
01:54:57.961 --> 01:54:58.780
<v Speaker 3>repercussions,</v>

2903
01:54:58.780 --> 01:55:00.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm not worried about the repercussions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For me,</v>

2904
01:55:00.101 --> 01:55:00.934
<v Speaker 2>I'm worried about foisting repercussions</v>
<v Speaker 2>on other people that have no control </v>

2905
01:55:02.921 --> 01:55:03.754
<v Speaker 2>over what I'm saying.</v>

2906
01:55:03.810 --> 01:55:05.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But even even that,</v>

2907
01:55:05.700 --> 01:55:06.533
<v Speaker 3>it's like it's not your responsibility </v>
<v Speaker 3>as long as you're communicating in an </v>

2908
01:55:08.820 --> 01:55:10.410
<v Speaker 3>honest way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

2909
01:55:11.400 --> 01:55:12.233
<v Speaker 3>I mean you're thinking that's sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the same reason why people didn't come </v>

2910
01:55:14.911 --> 01:55:15.744
<v Speaker 3>to your support in the first place </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they were worried that if they </v>

2911
01:55:17.791 --> 01:55:19.770
<v Speaker 3>spoke their mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would be targeted.</v>

2912
01:55:19.920 --> 01:55:20.753
<v Speaker 3>If they said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2913
01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:22.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that this is going on.</v>

2914
01:55:22.501 --> 01:55:23.730
<v Speaker 3>I think Collins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a great guy,</v>

2915
01:55:23.731 --> 01:55:24.564
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he's sexist and my feeling</v>
<v Speaker 3>on them is that it was just a joke and </v>

2916
01:55:27.961 --> 01:55:29.970
<v Speaker 3>then they could get targeted and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>chose not to.</v>

2917
01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:30.833
<v Speaker 3>They chose not to step up and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of ways you not speaking your </v>

2918
01:55:34.531 --> 01:55:37.560
<v Speaker 3>mind in a clear way sort of sets that </v>
<v Speaker 3>same sort of tone.</v>

2919
01:55:37.890 --> 01:55:38.723
<v Speaker 3>I think you should be able to speak </v>
<v Speaker 3>freely and I think you should be held </v>

2920
01:55:40.471 --> 01:55:41.304
<v Speaker 3>responsible for when you say something </v>
<v Speaker 3>and irresponsible like it's or it's </v>

2921
01:55:44.881 --> 01:55:45.714
<v Speaker 3>wrong or it's hurtful in some ways and </v>
<v Speaker 3>people make mistakes like that all the </v>

2922
01:55:48.331 --> 01:55:49.164
<v Speaker 3>time and there's also we have to take </v>
<v Speaker 3>into account that a lot of times people </v>

2923
01:55:51.091 --> 01:55:51.924
<v Speaker 3>don't realize the consequences of their </v>
<v Speaker 3>words or they say things in a flippant </v>

2924
01:55:54.481 --> 01:55:55.314
<v Speaker 3>manner or they're tired or they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>stressed or things come out that they </v>

2925
01:55:57.961 --> 01:55:58.794
<v Speaker 3>don't necessarily believe in that way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but especially when it comes to like </v>

2926
01:56:01.800 --> 01:56:05.640
<v Speaker 3>something like twitter or some short </v>
<v Speaker 3>form short paragraphs sort of a thing.</v>

2927
01:56:06.120 --> 01:56:06.953
<v Speaker 3>I think it's really important that we be</v>
<v Speaker 3>given the opportunity to express </v>

2928
01:56:10.171 --> 01:56:11.004
<v Speaker 3>ourselves fully and then the </v>
<v Speaker 3>disagreements with that be categorized </v>

2929
01:56:15.330 --> 01:56:16.163
<v Speaker 3>in an honest way and what I had the most</v>
<v Speaker 3>problem with was not just someone </v>

2930
01:56:20.161 --> 01:56:20.994
<v Speaker 3>calling you a racist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but everyone was making it out to be </v>

2931
01:56:23.431 --> 01:56:26.640
<v Speaker 3>this horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sexist,</v>

2932
01:56:26.730 --> 01:56:30.660
<v Speaker 3>evil thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When it's clearly something said in jest</v>

2933
01:56:30.900 --> 01:56:33.280
<v Speaker 3>and as soon as you can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's my wheelhouse.</v>

2934
01:56:33.300 --> 01:56:34.133
<v Speaker 3>As soon as you start taking humor and </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that people say that it's </v>

2935
01:56:37.291 --> 01:56:41.340
<v Speaker 3>absolutely meant to be just funny and </v>
<v Speaker 3>make it as like the,</v>

2936
01:56:41.360 --> 01:56:42.193
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy just signed an affidavit that </v>

2937
01:56:42.961 --> 01:56:45.210
<v Speaker 3>women should shut the fuck up because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's better.</v>

2938
01:56:45.510 --> 01:56:47.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's really the worst case scenario.</v>

2939
01:56:47.521 --> 01:56:48.900
<v Speaker 3>Interpretation of what you said.</v>

2940
01:56:49.200 --> 01:56:49.691
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2941
01:56:49.691 --> 01:56:50.910
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2942
01:56:50.911 --> 01:56:55.470
<v Speaker 2>I think that that was the disappointing </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of it was again,</v>

2943
01:56:55.471 --> 01:56:57.450
<v Speaker 2>it goes back to this point of like </v>
<v Speaker 2>ignored everything.</v>

2944
01:56:57.451 --> 01:57:00.240
<v Speaker 2>Like my body of work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the things that I actually stood up very</v>

2945
01:57:00.241 --> 01:57:01.074
<v Speaker 2>loudly for political and social causes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many times there are huge videos I have </v>

2946
01:57:03.321 --> 01:57:04.154
<v Speaker 2>of the things that my feelings on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>confederate flag or like how I feel </v>

2947
01:57:06.991 --> 01:57:09.030
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did you think about the confederate</v>

2948
01:57:09.031 --> 01:57:09.864
<v Speaker 2>flag?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that you have the right to fly </v>

2949
01:57:10.591 --> 01:57:11.424
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think it's in terrible taste and </v>

2950
01:57:11.971 --> 01:57:13.880
<v Speaker 2>I understand why people were upset about</v>
<v Speaker 2>it and I don't think it should be in.</v>

2951
01:57:13.980 --> 01:57:16.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't think the flag of a trader is </v>
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

2952
01:57:16.601 --> 01:57:19.860
<v Speaker 2>It should be instituted in state flags </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the United States.</v>

2953
01:57:19.910 --> 01:57:22.110
<v Speaker 3>He's your dad I think is absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 3>valid.</v>

2954
01:57:22.111 --> 01:57:25.350
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that it's legal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it legal to have a Nazi flag?</v>

2955
01:57:25.740 --> 01:57:26.540
<v Speaker 3>Is it</v>

2956
01:57:26.540 --> 01:57:27.630
<v Speaker 2>almost wants to go?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2957
01:57:27.780 --> 01:57:28.613
<v Speaker 2>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I only see why it wouldn't be legal to </v>

2958
01:57:30.211 --> 01:57:31.044
<v Speaker 2>have the confederate flag,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you just can't have it on the Dukes </v>

2959
01:57:33.420 --> 01:57:34.480
<v Speaker 2>of hazzard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2960
01:57:34.770 --> 01:57:35.603
<v Speaker 2>to me it's like I'm not talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the legality of it because if you want </v>

2961
01:57:37.381 --> 01:57:39.230
<v Speaker 2>to fly a swastika out your house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're allowed to.</v>

2962
01:57:39.240 --> 01:57:40.740
<v Speaker 2>I think you should probably be allowed </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do that.</v>

2963
01:57:40.741 --> 01:57:41.574
<v Speaker 2>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're an absolute idiot for </v>

2964
01:57:42.721 --> 01:57:44.550
<v Speaker 2>doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's your right to be an idiot.</v>

2965
01:57:44.740 --> 01:57:47.070
<v Speaker 2>But the confederate flag thing was just </v>
<v Speaker 2>a sign for me because it was,</v>

2966
01:57:47.090 --> 01:57:48.060
<v Speaker 2>it was this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was this,</v>

2967
01:57:48.061 --> 01:57:48.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2968
01:57:48.750 --> 01:57:50.490
<v Speaker 2>this juxtaposition of saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2969
01:57:50.491 --> 01:57:52.470
<v Speaker 2>well we're talking about the legal </v>
<v Speaker 2>rights,</v>

2970
01:57:52.471 --> 01:57:53.760
<v Speaker 2>but actually I'm talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>taste,</v>

2971
01:57:53.920 --> 01:57:54.460
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2972
01:57:54.460 --> 01:57:57.600
<v Speaker 2>like say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people don't remember what the CSA was.</v>

2973
01:57:57.601 --> 01:57:59.820
<v Speaker 2>I don't think a lot of people even fly </v>
<v Speaker 2>that flag and know what the hell they're</v>

2974
01:57:59.821 --> 01:58:03.810
<v Speaker 2>flying this country seceded from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>United States.</v>

2975
01:58:03.900 --> 01:58:08.220
<v Speaker 2>They were traders and or their Leonard </v>
<v Speaker 2>skinner fence,</v>

2976
01:58:08.340 --> 01:58:11.140
<v Speaker 2>or they're huge Leonard skinner advance </v>
<v Speaker 2>a huge big and Mississippi like,</v>

2977
01:58:11.180 --> 01:58:12.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to me I'm like,</v>

2978
01:58:12.900 --> 01:58:13.701
<v Speaker 2>we have to have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>

2979
01:58:13.701 --> 01:58:16.290
<v Speaker 2>let's put this in historicity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's think about what we're doing here.</v>

2980
01:58:16.560 --> 01:58:21.300
<v Speaker 2>This country left to protect its slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's right to own slaves.</v>

2981
01:58:21.301 --> 01:58:23.670
<v Speaker 2>Any other interpretation of it is wrong </v>
<v Speaker 2>based on,</v>

2982
01:58:23.720 --> 01:58:26.370
<v Speaker 2>on what was going on in the 18 fifties </v>
<v Speaker 2>and leading up to 18,</v>

2983
01:58:26.371 --> 01:58:28.470
<v Speaker 2>60 these states' rights advocate and all</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2984
01:58:28.471 --> 01:58:31.080
<v Speaker 2>That's not what it was about economics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not what it was about.</v>

2985
01:58:31.140 --> 01:58:33.120
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't about states' rights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't about any of those things.</v>

2986
01:58:33.121 --> 01:58:33.954
<v Speaker 2>It was about your ability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your economy would have fallen apart </v>

2987
01:58:35.131 --> 01:58:38.160
<v Speaker 2>without free labor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And these people left.</v>

2988
01:58:38.730 --> 01:58:39.563
<v Speaker 2>They caused a gratuitously bloody war </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they were let me know both </v>

2989
01:58:43.900 --> 01:58:46.510
<v Speaker 2>Abraham Lincoln and then Andrew Johnson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just let them back in,</v>

2990
01:58:47.020 --> 01:58:47.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2991
01:58:47.770 --> 01:58:50.470
<v Speaker 2>Jefferson Davis who was the president of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the confederacy,</v>

2992
01:58:50.980 --> 01:58:52.300
<v Speaker 2>wasn't murdered.</v>

2993
01:58:52.390 --> 01:58:53.920
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't executed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2994
01:58:53.921 --> 01:58:58.270
<v Speaker 2>like they were all back in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for some reason,</v>

2995
01:58:58.271 --> 01:59:00.610
<v Speaker 2>because reconstruction went the way it </v>
<v Speaker 2>did into the,</v>

2996
01:59:00.611 --> 01:59:03.970
<v Speaker 2>into the ulysses s grant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of a era of presidency,</v>

2997
01:59:04.180 --> 01:59:05.230
<v Speaker 2>people look at it and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2998
01:59:05.231 --> 01:59:07.240
<v Speaker 2>things kind of ended good and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of like brothers again.</v>

2999
01:59:07.241 --> 01:59:08.074
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not really the way it was with </v>

3000
01:59:08.710 --> 01:59:11.710
<v Speaker 2>Jim crow came up and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This fucking flag means something,</v>

3001
01:59:11.711 --> 01:59:15.010
<v Speaker 2>the Pfarius and you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's your right to fly it.</v>

3002
01:59:15.011 --> 01:59:16.570
<v Speaker 2>And if you feel like that's a southern </v>
<v Speaker 2>pride thing,</v>

3003
01:59:16.610 --> 01:59:17.770
<v Speaker 2>more power to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love the south.</v>

3004
01:59:17.771 --> 01:59:20.350
<v Speaker 2>I think the south awesome south needs </v>
<v Speaker 2>another flag.</v>

3005
01:59:20.440 --> 01:59:21.340
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would need to.</v>

3006
01:59:21.341 --> 01:59:23.800
<v Speaker 2>You need to know what this flag means to</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

3007
01:59:23.880 --> 01:59:27.730
<v Speaker 2>You guys left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys killed hundreds of thousands of</v>

3008
01:59:27.790 --> 01:59:32.140
<v Speaker 2>people doing it and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you just fly.</v>

3009
01:59:32.141 --> 01:59:33.520
<v Speaker 2>This flag is like the south will rise </v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

3010
01:59:33.521 --> 01:59:34.070
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it won't.</v>

3011
01:59:34.070 --> 01:59:36.700
<v Speaker 3>Don't you think that that's a bad </v>
<v Speaker 3>expression.</v>

3012
01:59:36.710 --> 01:59:38.870
<v Speaker 3>The south will rise again is a terrible </v>
<v Speaker 3>expression.</v>

3013
01:59:38.871 --> 01:59:39.704
<v Speaker 3>But I think that a lot of people look at</v>
<v Speaker 3>that flag and it represents what we're </v>

3014
01:59:43.581 --> 01:59:45.770
<v Speaker 3>calling southern pride,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is nothing wrong.</v>

3015
01:59:45.771 --> 01:59:46.604
<v Speaker 3>Nothing wrong with being proud of being </v>
<v Speaker 3>from Georgia or wherever the fuck your </v>

3016
01:59:48.480 --> 01:59:49.790
<v Speaker 3>friends states down there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3017
01:59:49.791 --> 01:59:50.624
<v Speaker 3>but I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the issue is what it means to other </v>

3018
01:59:52.311 --> 01:59:53.144
<v Speaker 3>people you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and whether or not that's valid when </v>

3019
01:59:55.071 --> 01:59:56.810
<v Speaker 3>you're not talking about like touchy </v>
<v Speaker 3>feely,</v>

3020
01:59:56.840 --> 01:59:57.673
<v Speaker 3>like people being oversensitive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you're talking about a horrible war </v>

3021
02:00:01.400 --> 02:00:02.233
<v Speaker 3>about slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like probably one of the worst </v>

3022
02:00:03.711 --> 02:00:04.544
<v Speaker 3>kinds of wars like a war because we </v>
<v Speaker 3>would like to keep people in prison and </v>

3023
02:00:08.361 --> 02:00:09.194
<v Speaker 3>working for free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're willing to kill other people </v>

3024
02:00:10.940 --> 02:00:12.560
<v Speaker 3>over it to fight for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3025
02:00:12.620 --> 02:00:13.950
<v Speaker 3>This is essentially what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3026
02:00:14.210 --> 02:00:15.043
<v Speaker 3>So it's to the people of today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't seem like that because </v>

3027
02:00:17.781 --> 02:00:22.490
<v Speaker 3>they're not living in 1850,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not in the days when you know,</v>

3028
02:00:22.491 --> 02:00:23.324
<v Speaker 3>they have these massive like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Gettysburg or they have these </v>

3029
02:00:27.260 --> 02:00:29.630
<v Speaker 3>massive areas where people would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>slaughtered.</v>

3030
02:00:29.900 --> 02:00:32.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean this people to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's still fine.</v>

3031
02:00:32.001 --> 02:00:35.810
<v Speaker 3>Like civil war shit where they had these</v>
<v Speaker 3>massive battles and they can dig through</v>

3032
02:00:35.811 --> 02:00:40.370
<v Speaker 3>the ground with metal detectors and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>find bullets and guns and badges and</v>

3033
02:00:40.690 --> 02:00:41.750
<v Speaker 2>awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's great.</v>

3034
02:00:41.770 --> 02:00:42.700
<v Speaker 2>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3035
02:00:42.701 --> 02:00:43.534
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I took the idea from a saving private </v>

3036
02:00:44.801 --> 02:00:45.634
<v Speaker 2>Ryan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy that would take dirt from all </v>

3037
02:00:46.421 --> 02:00:47.440
<v Speaker 2>the battlefields,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they would go to them,</v>

3038
02:00:47.441 --> 02:00:48.450
<v Speaker 2>put it in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put it in jars,</v>

3039
02:00:49.200 --> 02:00:50.980
<v Speaker 2>he and you put it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They only showed it once in the movie,</v>

3040
02:00:51.160 --> 02:00:51.993
<v Speaker 2>but I used to go to all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>battlefields when I was a kid because I </v>

3041
02:00:53.141 --> 02:00:54.610
<v Speaker 2>was fascinated by my parents would bring</v>
<v Speaker 2>me in,</v>

3042
02:00:54.611 --> 02:00:56.980
<v Speaker 2>I would take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would go buy baby food and dumped them</v>

3043
02:00:56.981 --> 02:00:57.814
<v Speaker 2>out and then go to all the battlefields </v>
<v Speaker 2>and put dirt on each of them and put </v>

3044
02:01:00.061 --> 02:01:00.894
<v Speaker 2>them on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3045
02:01:01.160 --> 02:01:02.230
<v Speaker 2>that's heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3046
02:01:02.231 --> 02:01:03.940
<v Speaker 2>I like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you were a kid.</v>

3047
02:01:03.970 --> 02:01:05.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like my in my teens and early twenties.</v>

3048
02:01:05.591 --> 02:01:07.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you've always been into this.</v>

3049
02:01:07.190 --> 02:01:08.140
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Since I was,</v>

3050
02:01:08.290 --> 02:01:09.123
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my earliest memory is of being in the </v>

3051
02:01:11.261 --> 02:01:13.000
<v Speaker 2>politics and history was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was the Gulf War,</v>

3052
02:01:13.001 --> 02:01:13.834
<v Speaker 2>which was 99,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of the lead up to it with Kuwait </v>

3053
02:01:15.671 --> 02:01:15.920
<v Speaker 2>and stuff.</v>

3054
02:01:15.920 --> 02:01:17.890
<v Speaker 2>90 91.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was like six or seven.</v>

3055
02:01:17.891 --> 02:01:18.570
<v Speaker 2>I remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3056
02:01:18.570 --> 02:01:19.780
<v Speaker 2>Newsday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as Long Island newspaper,</v>

3057
02:01:19.781 --> 02:01:23.700
<v Speaker 2>I remember just seeing images and kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of maps and,</v>

3058
02:01:23.780 --> 02:01:25.190
<v Speaker 2>and I didn't really understand what was </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>

3059
02:01:25.191 --> 02:01:26.410
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't even read most of the words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3060
02:01:26.420 --> 02:01:28.270
<v Speaker 2>it's complicated geopolitical stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're talking about,</v>

3061
02:01:28.271 --> 02:01:29.104
<v Speaker 2>but I ever since that point I was very </v>
<v Speaker 2>politically focused on my dad is a </v>

3062
02:01:32.081 --> 02:01:33.910
<v Speaker 2>staunch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Rockefeller Republican,</v>

3063
02:01:33.911 --> 02:01:36.250
<v Speaker 2>like a Paleo con,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a moderate Republican,</v>

3064
02:01:36.820 --> 02:01:38.380
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the old north,</v>

3065
02:01:38.381 --> 02:01:40.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people out there right now.</v>

3066
02:01:40.011 --> 02:01:42.590
<v Speaker 2>But like Republicans are pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>disparate group,</v>

3067
02:01:42.620 --> 02:01:43.453
<v Speaker 2>like Republicans in New England are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Republicans in New York are very </v>

3068
02:01:45.591 --> 02:01:46.424
<v Speaker 2>different than Republicans in Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're both Republicans and my dad </v>

3069
02:01:49.730 --> 02:01:51.960
<v Speaker 2>grew up just in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3070
02:01:52.220 --> 02:01:55.490
<v Speaker 2>giving me things to read and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and feeding that fire and by me maps and</v>

3071
02:01:55.491 --> 02:01:56.324
<v Speaker 2>buying me books and we will listen to </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk radio and we would debate things </v>

3072
02:01:58.971 --> 02:02:01.500
<v Speaker 2>and we would kind of come to these </v>
<v Speaker 2>conclusions of different things.</v>

3073
02:02:01.500 --> 02:02:03.650
<v Speaker 2>And we disagree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of things still to this day.</v>

3074
02:02:03.651 --> 02:02:05.240
<v Speaker 2>But he's a great man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

3075
02:02:05.780 --> 02:02:07.370
<v Speaker 2>ever since then I was really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really interested in.</v>

3076
02:02:07.371 --> 02:02:08.204
<v Speaker 2>I knew when I was fourth or fifth grade </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I would study history and I </v>

3077
02:02:10.281 --> 02:02:11.114
<v Speaker 2>remember in New York we have this thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>called the regions in high school which </v>

3078
02:02:13.881 --> 02:02:14.714
<v Speaker 2>are like these tests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these state run tests you have to pass </v>

3079
02:02:15.951 --> 02:02:16.784
<v Speaker 2>to graduate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like you would take your class but </v>

3080
02:02:18.021 --> 02:02:20.150
<v Speaker 2>then you have to take your final,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you have to take a regents exam</v>

3081
02:02:20.151 --> 02:02:21.650
<v Speaker 2>which is the state run thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say like,</v>

3082
02:02:21.651 --> 02:02:22.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>math,</v>

3083
02:02:22.700 --> 02:02:23.533
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

3084
02:02:23.780 --> 02:02:24.613
<v Speaker 2>And I remember when I was in sixth grade</v>
<v Speaker 2>and my sister alley who is six years </v>

3085
02:02:26.601 --> 02:02:27.434
<v Speaker 2>older than me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was taking the US history regents </v>

3086
02:02:29.420 --> 02:02:32.810
<v Speaker 2>like the next few days from then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I helped her study and I,</v>

3087
02:02:32.970 --> 02:02:33.803
<v Speaker 2>and like I remember like she didn't know</v>
<v Speaker 2>any really anything she needed to know </v>

3088
02:02:36.561 --> 02:02:37.394
<v Speaker 2>and I taught her like what she needed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>know just for this very rudimentary </v>

3089
02:02:40.221 --> 02:02:41.030
<v Speaker 2>test.</v>

3090
02:02:41.030 --> 02:02:42.820
<v Speaker 2>And that was stuck in my mind where I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>

3091
02:02:42.821 --> 02:02:43.970
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a real passion for this.</v>

3092
02:02:44.060 --> 02:02:45.140
<v Speaker 2>I really like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy it.</v>

3093
02:02:45.141 --> 02:02:45.974
<v Speaker 2>I don't know everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I make mistakes sometimes and I changed </v>

3094
02:02:47.901 --> 02:02:50.240
<v Speaker 2>the way I feel sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's always been a real,</v>

3095
02:02:50.270 --> 02:02:53.000
<v Speaker 2>real fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that you've left your company,</v>

3096
02:02:53.120 --> 02:02:56.480
<v Speaker 2>the which was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

3097
02:02:56.510 --> 02:02:57.500
<v Speaker 2>what was it called?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kind of fun.</v>

3098
02:02:57.501 --> 02:02:58.050
<v Speaker 2>Kind of funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3099
02:02:58.050 --> 02:02:58.883
<v Speaker 2>and what was kind of funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of funny was the four of us that </v>

3100
02:03:00.981 --> 02:03:01.814
<v Speaker 2>founded the company were all at ign in </v>
<v Speaker 2>different respects and we spun off to </v>

3101
02:03:05.631 --> 02:03:06.464
<v Speaker 2>just start our own youtube channel about</v>
<v Speaker 2>games and nerd culture and stuff like </v>

3102
02:03:08.661 --> 02:03:09.494
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do podcasts and we found some good </v>

3103
02:03:10.731 --> 02:03:11.564
<v Speaker 2>success,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost a crowdfunded on Patrion and it </v>

3104
02:03:13.551 --> 02:03:15.770
<v Speaker 2>was a lot of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I enjoyed it,</v>

3105
02:03:15.771 --> 02:03:16.604
<v Speaker 2>but I felt like I needed to leave </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I felt like that was the best </v>

3106
02:03:17.901 --> 02:03:18.620
<v Speaker 2>for everybody.</v>

3107
02:03:18.620 --> 02:03:19.820
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once that.</v>

3108
02:03:20.710 --> 02:03:21.543
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how could you not if he turned on you </v>

3109
02:03:22.461 --> 02:03:24.350
<v Speaker 2>over that stupid fucking joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3110
02:03:24.351 --> 02:03:25.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a stupid joke.</v>

3111
02:03:25.860 --> 02:03:28.490
<v Speaker 2>It was a bad joke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean it's not even that bad.</v>

3112
02:03:28.550 --> 02:03:29.240
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate that.</v>

3113
02:03:29.240 --> 02:03:30.590
<v Speaker 2>That means a lot coming from you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I looked at it.</v>

3114
02:03:30.700 --> 02:03:31.533
<v Speaker 2>That's stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reaction to it was so fucking </v>

3115
02:03:32.901 --> 02:03:34.460
<v Speaker 2>stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was stupid and I felt like,</v>

3116
02:03:34.461 --> 02:03:35.294
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish that I wish that things went </v>

3117
02:03:36.531 --> 02:03:37.430
<v Speaker 2>differently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish that,</v>

3118
02:03:37.850 --> 02:03:38.683
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had a lot of fights behind the </v>

3119
02:03:39.381 --> 02:03:40.191
<v Speaker 2>scenes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I won't get into all that.</v>

3120
02:03:40.191 --> 02:03:41.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I honestly think it's good.</v>

3121
02:03:42.110 --> 02:03:43.190
<v Speaker 2>I think it's good to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

3122
02:03:43.191 --> 02:03:44.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3123
02:03:44.450 --> 02:03:45.283
<v Speaker 2>I felt like I did what was right for </v>
<v Speaker 2>them and I felt like we would have just </v>

3124
02:03:47.511 --> 02:03:49.520
<v Speaker 2>come to this impasse again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>

3125
02:03:49.820 --> 02:03:51.670
<v Speaker 2>let's just pull the bandaid off and get </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get this over with.</v>

3126
02:03:51.710 --> 02:03:53.900
<v Speaker 2>Are you going to do something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>involves politics now?</v>

3127
02:03:53.901 --> 02:03:56.240
<v Speaker 2>Because clearly you have a deep passion </v>
<v Speaker 2>for this.</v>

3128
02:03:56.270 --> 02:03:57.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started a,</v>

3129
02:03:57.111 --> 02:03:57.944
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a new youtube channel that the first </v>

3130
02:03:59.121 --> 02:04:01.340
<v Speaker 2>video about April third.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called Colin's last stand.</v>

3131
02:04:01.610 --> 02:04:03.140
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and crazy.</v>

3132
02:04:03.141 --> 02:04:07.310
<v Speaker 2>It's already funded on Patrion 38,</v>
<v Speaker 2>$38,000 a mind for.</v>

3133
02:04:08.030 --> 02:04:08.510
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

3134
02:04:08.510 --> 02:04:10.680
<v Speaker 2>People are committing an expression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do it.</v>

3135
02:04:10.690 --> 02:04:12.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I think it's powerful.</v>

3136
02:04:12.171 --> 02:04:14.870
<v Speaker 2>Like there are things worth dying for </v>
<v Speaker 2>things worth risking.</v>

3137
02:04:15.040 --> 02:04:16.300
<v Speaker 2>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

3138
02:04:16.310 --> 02:04:20.990
<v Speaker 2>I reached $39,000 a month and it's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to fall $39,000 a month.</v>

3139
02:04:21.050 --> 02:04:22.690
<v Speaker 2>People it's going to fall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it's going to fall.</v>

3140
02:04:23.030 --> 02:04:24.710
<v Speaker 2>People.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit Dude.</v>

3141
02:04:24.711 --> 02:04:25.544
<v Speaker 2>People are talking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are responding to my this holy </v>

3142
02:04:28.461 --> 02:04:29.750
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot of fucking money.</v>

3143
02:04:30.110 --> 02:04:30.943
<v Speaker 2>30 nine grand a month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to get $39,000 a month and </v>

3144
02:04:33.891 --> 02:04:35.630
<v Speaker 2>you haven't even started yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3145
02:04:35.631 --> 02:04:36.464
<v Speaker 2>technically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's going to fall back down to the </v>

3146
02:04:39.001 --> 02:04:39.380
<v Speaker 2>teens.</v>

3147
02:04:39.380 --> 02:04:42.480
<v Speaker 2>Probably relaxed with your humility will</v>
<v Speaker 2>take it down.</v>

3148
02:04:43.170 --> 02:04:44.760
<v Speaker 2>If you scroll here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll see on the left side,</v>

3149
02:04:44.761 --> 02:04:47.700
<v Speaker 2>underneath the number.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My stretch goal is to reach $10,000.</v>

3150
02:04:47.790 --> 02:04:48.700
<v Speaker 2>So my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

3151
02:04:48.810 --> 02:04:51.480
<v Speaker 2>my expectations were blown out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>water and I really.</v>

3152
02:04:51.481 --> 02:04:52.860
<v Speaker 2>What I read into the show is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

3153
02:04:52.861 --> 02:04:57.120
<v Speaker 2>is you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are just sick of this bullshit.</v>

3154
02:04:57.360 --> 02:04:58.193
<v Speaker 2>This is them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is them speaking and being like we </v>

3155
02:04:59.941 --> 02:05:00.774
<v Speaker 2>need a conduit that's going to get into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the history and get into the philosophy </v>

3156
02:05:03.421 --> 02:05:04.254
<v Speaker 2>and the politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But also that will stand up and say </v>

3157
02:05:05.491 --> 02:05:07.110
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sorry for a joke.</v>

3158
02:05:07.111 --> 02:05:07.944
<v Speaker 2>People have the right to make mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People have the right to express </v>

3159
02:05:09.181 --> 02:05:10.014
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It goes back to the confederate flag </v>

3160
02:05:11.341 --> 02:05:12.174
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might disagree with a person that </v>

3161
02:05:13.321 --> 02:05:15.660
<v Speaker 2>flies that flag,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not going to go wrap up on their</v>

3162
02:05:15.661 --> 02:05:17.790
<v Speaker 2>door and pull it off and call them a </v>
<v Speaker 2>racist.</v>

3163
02:05:17.790 --> 02:05:19.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to shake my head and </v>
<v Speaker 2>walk,</v>

3164
02:05:19.170 --> 02:05:20.003
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there are other things to worry </v>

3165
02:05:20.881 --> 02:05:21.714
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's people that like want more </v>

3166
02:05:23.341 --> 02:05:24.174
<v Speaker 2>liberty focused,</v>
<v Speaker 2>individual focused kind of things and </v>

3167
02:05:26.850 --> 02:05:29.550
<v Speaker 2>that's just people speaking to me,</v>

3168
02:05:29.610 --> 02:05:30.443
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the number will fall back down after </v>

3169
02:05:31.321 --> 02:05:31.830
<v Speaker 2>the month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sharing.</v>

3178
02:05:49.021 --> 02:05:49.854
<v Speaker 2>The problem is everyone's going to know </v>
<v Speaker 2>what the numbers are and they're going </v>

3179
02:05:51.181 --> 02:05:52.480
<v Speaker 2>to go out or I need to give him any </v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

3180
02:05:52.490 --> 02:05:54.120
<v Speaker 2>He's making $39,000 a month.</v>

3181
02:05:54.150 --> 02:05:55.290
<v Speaker 2>That's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not fine.</v>

3182
02:05:55.320 --> 02:05:56.700
<v Speaker 2>She'd hide that number.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you hide it?</v>

3183
02:05:56.701 --> 02:05:57.900
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I feel like I want to be.</v>

3184
02:05:57.910 --> 02:05:58.743
<v Speaker 2>I want to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to be honest with people and oh </v>

3185
02:06:00.100 --> 02:06:00.933
<v Speaker 2>my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you weren't patrion you'd frigging </v>

3186
02:06:01.441 --> 02:06:03.030
<v Speaker 2>kill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got to get that cash the sun.</v>

3187
02:06:03.060 --> 02:06:03.930
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you kind of hide it,</v>

3188
02:06:03.931 --> 02:06:05.940
<v Speaker 2>but I want it to be totally transparent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I keep telling people is,</v>

3189
02:06:05.941 --> 02:06:07.980
<v Speaker 2>as long as we keep a level of </v>
<v Speaker 2>sustainable level of money,</v>

3190
02:06:07.981 --> 02:06:10.740
<v Speaker 2>which is way less than what I have now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there'll be no baked and adds,</v>

3191
02:06:10.800 --> 02:06:12.210
<v Speaker 2>no product placements,</v>
<v Speaker 2>none of that.</v>

3192
02:06:12.211 --> 02:06:15.020
<v Speaker 2>And I want people to know I want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want people to be involved in the,</v>

3193
02:06:15.040 --> 02:06:15.870
<v Speaker 2>in it from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

3194
02:06:15.870 --> 02:06:19.820
<v Speaker 2>So Colin's last stand is about politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be.</v>

3195
02:06:19.830 --> 02:06:20.663
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I want to do two videos a week </v>

3196
02:06:22.260 --> 02:06:25.110
<v Speaker 2>between 10 and 15 minutes long each that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are scripted and written.</v>

3197
02:06:25.310 --> 02:06:26.830
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I know how to edit and something.</v>

3198
02:06:26.831 --> 02:06:29.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm very good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The quality of the videos,</v>

3199
02:06:29.270 --> 02:06:29.910
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a,</v>

3200
02:06:29.910 --> 02:06:32.070
<v Speaker 2>from an ethical perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll find better quality.</v>

3201
02:06:32.071 --> 02:06:33.750
<v Speaker 2>But I want the content to be really </v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

3202
02:06:34.140 --> 02:06:35.610
<v Speaker 2>And so I want to just do two videos a </v>
<v Speaker 2>week,</v>

3203
02:06:35.640 --> 02:06:38.280
<v Speaker 2>one probably focused on history and one </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably focused on politics.</v>

3204
02:06:38.460 --> 02:06:39.293
<v Speaker 2>So one that's more rooted in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in philosophy that I'll go research and </v>

3205
02:06:41.281 --> 02:06:42.114
<v Speaker 2>write.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm already researching and writing the </v>

3206
02:06:42.421 --> 02:06:43.740
<v Speaker 2>first one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to ruin it for anyone yet,</v>

3207
02:06:43.741 --> 02:06:46.170
<v Speaker 2>but I think it'd be really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the second,</v>

3208
02:06:46.620 --> 02:06:47.453
<v Speaker 2>maybe the second video every week will </v>
<v Speaker 2>be something about what's happening in </v>

3209
02:06:48.691 --> 02:06:50.310
<v Speaker 2>the world and I'll talk to a camera and </v>
<v Speaker 2>just be like,</v>

3210
02:06:50.311 --> 02:06:52.860
<v Speaker 2>this is the way I feel about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is maybe why I feel this way.</v>

3211
02:06:53.220 --> 02:06:54.990
<v Speaker 2>And just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And just some stuff out there.</v>

3212
02:06:55.080 --> 02:06:57.900
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to treat people's time with care.</v>

3213
02:06:57.901 --> 02:06:59.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't have the brand you have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have,</v>

3214
02:06:59.690 --> 02:07:00.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are,</v>

3215
02:07:00.510 --> 02:07:02.670
<v Speaker 2>that are religious about listening to </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything I do.</v>

3216
02:07:02.880 --> 02:07:04.500
<v Speaker 2>So I want people to like look forward to</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying like,</v>

3217
02:07:04.501 --> 02:07:05.430
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>twice a week column.</v>

3218
02:07:05.431 --> 02:07:07.320
<v Speaker 2>I put up a 10 minute video that I can </v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

3219
02:07:07.440 --> 02:07:08.273
<v Speaker 2>when I'm making dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just listened to it in the background </v>

3220
02:07:09.331 --> 02:07:11.880
<v Speaker 2>and then go about my day and maybe learn</v>
<v Speaker 2>something or maybe feel a certain way or</v>

3221
02:07:11.881 --> 02:07:14.050
<v Speaker 2>maybe I disagree and then move on and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3222
02:07:14.060 --> 02:07:14.893
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and have it just be a part of people's </v>

3223
02:07:15.961 --> 02:07:16.470
<v Speaker 2>lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that.</v>

3224
02:07:16.470 --> 02:07:17.303
<v Speaker 2>So clearly you've put a lot of thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>into this and you've thought this </v>

3225
02:07:18.901 --> 02:07:21.750
<v Speaker 2>through obviously something you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>really planning out.</v>

3226
02:07:21.751 --> 02:07:22.441
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3227
02:07:22.441 --> 02:07:25.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that was actually the one,</v>

3228
02:07:25.080 --> 02:07:25.913
<v Speaker 2>the number kept rising.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was horrified like at first because I </v>

3229
02:07:27.751 --> 02:07:29.430
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I was like,</v>

3230
02:07:30.350 --> 02:07:31.400
<v Speaker 2>I have that ability.</v>

3231
02:07:31.450 --> 02:07:34.810
<v Speaker 2>Like I hate money though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was of course I love money but I,</v>

3232
02:07:34.820 --> 02:07:35.653
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like the imposter syndrome where </v>

3233
02:07:36.311 --> 02:07:38.230
<v Speaker 2>you never really know that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>earning it or whatever.</v>

3234
02:07:38.231 --> 02:07:39.230
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want,</v>

3235
02:07:39.250 --> 02:07:42.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to let anyone down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I only have right now the intro video,</v>

3236
02:07:42.731 --> 02:07:44.770
<v Speaker 2>which is just me talking to the camera </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of with what my plan is.</v>

3237
02:07:44.771 --> 02:07:48.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to really keep people engaged</v>
<v Speaker 2>and putting update videos on and letting</v>

3238
02:07:48.071 --> 02:07:49.740
<v Speaker 2>them know where everything is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3239
02:07:49.900 --> 02:07:51.340
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was horrified because I'm like,</v>

3240
02:07:51.760 --> 02:07:52.593
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I only have the bandwidth to do two </v>

3241
02:07:54.371 --> 02:07:55.204
<v Speaker 2>videos a week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether I'm making $15,000 a month or </v>

3242
02:07:56.531 --> 02:07:57.364
<v Speaker 2>$40,000 a month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if I put out a video to everyone </v>

3243
02:08:00.071 --> 02:08:00.904
<v Speaker 2>being like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if this level sustained or even a level </v>

3244
02:08:01.841 --> 02:08:03.250
<v Speaker 2>that's in the twenties or thirties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>

3245
02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.190
<v Speaker 2>I have to recalibrate what I'm thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3246
02:08:06.550 --> 02:08:08.050
<v Speaker 2>maybe I do hire someone to help me </v>
<v Speaker 2>shoot.</v>

3247
02:08:08.110 --> 02:08:11.080
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I do higher bandwidth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean by a bank?</v>

3248
02:08:11.140 --> 02:08:12.910
<v Speaker 2>The bandwidth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I don't want people were like,</v>

3249
02:08:12.911 --> 02:08:13.840
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can we get a podcast?</v>

3250
02:08:13.841 --> 02:08:15.220
<v Speaker 2>Can we do more videos a week and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

3251
02:08:15.221 --> 02:08:16.054
<v Speaker 2>that's not the vision for the product.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I only have enough bandwidth in my mind </v>

3252
02:08:18.380 --> 02:08:19.390
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3253
02:08:19.480 --> 02:08:21.280
<v Speaker 2>And it doesn't create time and space,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3254
02:08:21.281 --> 02:08:22.590
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3255
02:08:22.600 --> 02:08:23.433
<v Speaker 2>the money gives me means in the future </v>
<v Speaker 2>to maybe make the product more dynamic </v>

3256
02:08:26.951 --> 02:08:28.450
<v Speaker 2>or interesting or hire people and do </v>
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>

3257
02:08:28.660 --> 02:08:30.400
<v Speaker 2>But right now I just want to spend a few</v>
<v Speaker 2>months to like,</v>

3258
02:08:30.401 --> 02:08:31.630
<v Speaker 2>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what I'm planning,</v>

3259
02:08:32.140 --> 02:08:33.880
<v Speaker 2>I want to write these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to put care into them.</v>

3260
02:08:33.881 --> 02:08:34.714
<v Speaker 2>I want to give you citations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanna like have you give you further </v>

3261
02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:38.320
<v Speaker 2>things to read and all those kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

3262
02:08:38.321 --> 02:08:40.450
<v Speaker 2>And that takes time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you always like this,</v>

3263
02:08:40.451 --> 02:08:42.160
<v Speaker 2>like really hyped up and energetic.</v>

3264
02:08:42.160 --> 02:08:43.600
<v Speaker 2>Do you always have like this much </v>
<v Speaker 2>energy?</v>

3265
02:08:44.420 --> 02:08:46.750
<v Speaker 2>You always talk this fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a fast talker.</v>

3266
02:08:46.751 --> 02:08:48.190
<v Speaker 2>That's in New York thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm a.</v>

3267
02:08:48.750 --> 02:08:49.583
<v Speaker 2>I used to live in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You didn't know a lot of people that </v>

3268
02:08:50.651 --> 02:08:51.750
<v Speaker 2>talked very fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do it,</v>

3269
02:08:51.751 --> 02:08:52.584
<v Speaker 2>but you're like fucking ramped up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because it's something I'm </v>

3270
02:08:55.180 --> 02:08:56.490
<v Speaker 2>passionate about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3271
02:08:56.500 --> 02:08:57.333
<v Speaker 2>it's A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean to come off as annoying or </v>

3272
02:08:58.511 --> 02:08:58.841
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3273
02:08:58.841 --> 02:08:59.170
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

3274
02:08:59.170 --> 02:09:01.090
<v Speaker 2>You're not annoying at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's impressive.</v>

3275
02:09:01.120 --> 02:09:03.010
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just try to.</v>

3276
02:09:03.550 --> 02:09:06.940
<v Speaker 2>These are the things that I forgot for </v>
<v Speaker 2>so long in a way,</v>

3277
02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:08.590
<v Speaker 2>because I was writing about games,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I love.</v>

3278
02:09:08.650 --> 02:09:09.880
<v Speaker 2>I Love Games.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're important.</v>

3279
02:09:09.881 --> 02:09:11.740
<v Speaker 2>They're an important piece of escape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're an important piece of art.</v>

3280
02:09:11.950 --> 02:09:12.783
<v Speaker 2>I think that's all great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but being able to engage with someone </v>

3281
02:09:15.970 --> 02:09:20.020
<v Speaker 2>like yourself with someone like Dave </v>
<v Speaker 2>Rubin or someone like a Steven crowder,</v>

3282
02:09:20.021 --> 02:09:20.854
<v Speaker 2>whoever it might be.</v>

3283
02:09:21.100 --> 02:09:22.690
<v Speaker 2>I was on Glenn Beck's radio show last </v>
<v Speaker 2>week.</v>

3284
02:09:22.810 --> 02:09:26.030
<v Speaker 2>It brings out an energy in me that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>

3285
02:09:26.050 --> 02:09:27.720
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wear boats.</v>

3286
02:09:27.810 --> 02:09:28.870
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was on the phone,</v>

3287
02:09:28.871 --> 02:09:31.000
<v Speaker 2>so I have no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he could have been naked for all and uh,</v>

3288
02:09:31.150 --> 02:09:33.490
<v Speaker 2>but it brings out an energy in me where </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3289
02:09:33.520 --> 02:09:36.940
<v Speaker 2>I can finally engage with people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>know what the fuck they're talking about</v>

3290
02:09:36.941 --> 02:09:37.774
<v Speaker 2>in this particular realm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think is so exciting and so </v>

3291
02:09:39.551 --> 02:09:41.380
<v Speaker 2>interesting and we can have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3292
02:09:41.381 --> 02:09:42.460
<v Speaker 2>we had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we debated,</v>

3293
02:09:42.461 --> 02:09:44.050
<v Speaker 2>we don't agree on everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's awesome.</v>

3294
02:09:44.300 --> 02:09:46.970
<v Speaker 2>So that's really cool that you found,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3295
02:09:47.060 --> 02:09:47.893
<v Speaker 2>a very big positive out of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you can express yourself more </v>

3296
02:09:50.171 --> 02:09:51.004
<v Speaker 2>honestly and you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can gravitate towards your real </v>

3297
02:09:54.401 --> 02:09:56.380
<v Speaker 2>interests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yeah,</v>

3298
02:09:56.381 --> 02:09:58.660
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm trying to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to use this as an opportunity</v>

3299
02:09:58.990 --> 02:09:59.823
<v Speaker 2>for myself and try and use it as an </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity to just carve out a little </v>

3300
02:10:02.440 --> 02:10:04.960
<v Speaker 2>slice of the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>however big or small it might be,</v>

3301
02:10:05.320 --> 02:10:06.153
<v Speaker 2>where we can affect some positive change</v>
<v Speaker 2>and like an idea ideas and learning and </v>

3302
02:10:09.430 --> 02:10:10.263
<v Speaker 2>free expression and free thought and </v>
<v Speaker 2>making mistakes and disagreeing and all </v>

3303
02:10:13.481 --> 02:10:13.600
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

3304
02:10:13.600 --> 02:10:16.030
<v Speaker 2>I think that's all great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to use this as an example.</v>

3305
02:10:16.031 --> 02:10:18.190
<v Speaker 2>I want to get away from the Orthodoxy of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gaming industry.</v>

3306
02:10:18.191 --> 02:10:20.880
<v Speaker 2>It's stifling and strangling and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you think.</v>

3307
02:10:20.950 --> 02:10:23.140
<v Speaker 2>Let's go back to that because why do you</v>
<v Speaker 2>think it is like that?</v>

3308
02:10:23.800 --> 02:10:28.800
<v Speaker 2>Why is the gaming industry so hardcore </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideologically left wing progressive like</v>

3309
02:10:30.220 --> 02:10:32.560
<v Speaker 2>no variations?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No room for debate.</v>

3310
02:10:32.590 --> 02:10:33.530
<v Speaker 2>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3311
02:10:33.531 --> 02:10:36.260
<v Speaker 2>I think it's portrayed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it all gets funneled through a</v>

3312
02:10:36.261 --> 02:10:38.360
<v Speaker 2>media that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is hyper liberal,</v>

3313
02:10:38.361 --> 02:10:38.811
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

3314
02:10:38.811 --> 02:10:42.290
<v Speaker 2>it's similar in a way to what's going on</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the media in news and politics.</v>

3315
02:10:43.610 --> 02:10:44.840
<v Speaker 2>These,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3316
02:10:45.380 --> 02:10:46.213
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>underneath the surface of the gaming </v>

3317
02:10:47.691 --> 02:10:48.524
<v Speaker 2>industry are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are plenty of conservatives and </v>

3318
02:10:49.131 --> 02:10:49.990
<v Speaker 2>libertarians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

3319
02:10:50.330 --> 02:10:51.560
<v Speaker 2>they hide the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3320
02:10:51.740 --> 02:10:52.573
<v Speaker 2>they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of them.</v>

3321
02:10:52.720 --> 02:10:53.840
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

3322
02:10:54.050 --> 02:10:54.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go ahead.</v>

3323
02:10:54.920 --> 02:10:56.660
<v Speaker 2>I was going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them talk to me.</v>

3324
02:10:56.660 --> 02:10:57.493
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know people that are like heads of </v>

3325
02:10:58.041 --> 02:10:58.874
<v Speaker 2>studios that feel the way I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know people that are in the trenches </v>

3326
02:11:01.101 --> 02:11:03.560
<v Speaker 2>at Qa and doing very menial things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>gaming studios,</v>

3327
02:11:03.561 --> 02:11:04.850
<v Speaker 2>I feel the way I do and everything in </v>
<v Speaker 2>between.</v>

3328
02:11:05.150 --> 02:11:08.060
<v Speaker 2>I remember a GDC game developer </v>
<v Speaker 2>conference in San Francisco,</v>

3329
02:11:08.330 --> 02:11:11.180
<v Speaker 2>which happens every spring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Six or seven years ago,</v>

3330
02:11:11.181 --> 02:11:12.014
<v Speaker 2>a guy pulled me aside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This the first time it ever happened to </v>

3331
02:11:13.131 --> 02:11:14.140
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this was when I was kind of starting</v>

3332
02:11:14.141 --> 02:11:16.610
<v Speaker 2>to make a name for myself and he pulled </v>
<v Speaker 2>me aside and he's like,</v>

3333
02:11:16.611 --> 02:11:18.320
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I work at x,</v>

3334
02:11:18.321 --> 02:11:20.720
<v Speaker 2>Y andZ and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it works on a big game and he's like,</v>

3335
02:11:20.930 --> 02:11:23.300
<v Speaker 2>keep doing what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are a lot of people out there that</v>

3336
02:11:23.390 --> 02:11:25.310
<v Speaker 2>agree with what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3337
02:11:25.340 --> 02:11:26.173
<v Speaker 2>but they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

3338
02:11:26.320 --> 02:11:27.153
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't dare speak out because </v>

3339
02:11:29.900 --> 02:11:31.280
<v Speaker 2>they'll get lambasted in some way.</v>

3340
02:11:31.280 --> 02:11:33.080
<v Speaker 2>Look what happened to me over something </v>
<v Speaker 2>so innocuous.</v>

3341
02:11:33.200 --> 02:11:33.740
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you there,</v>

3342
02:11:33.740 --> 02:11:34.573
<v Speaker 2>obviously you were saying that there is </v>
<v Speaker 2>some pushback about your ideas before </v>

3343
02:11:38.361 --> 02:11:39.380
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3344
02:11:39.470 --> 02:11:41.210
<v Speaker 2>What did you experience?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3345
02:11:41.240 --> 02:11:42.073
<v Speaker 2>so every time I would write a </v>
<v Speaker 2>politically driven an op Ed for </v>

3346
02:11:45.381 --> 02:11:46.250
<v Speaker 2>instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was at ign,</v>

3347
02:11:46.251 --> 02:11:47.050
<v Speaker 2>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

3348
02:11:47.050 --> 02:11:47.883
<v Speaker 2>I was senior editor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I kinda had like editor at large </v>

3349
02:11:49.670 --> 02:11:51.410
<v Speaker 2>qualities were meaning for people I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know,</v>

3350
02:11:51.411 --> 02:11:52.244
<v Speaker 2>editor at large,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically in a way do whatever they </v>

3351
02:11:53.691 --> 02:11:54.524
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they'll find something to write </v>

3352
02:11:55.131 --> 02:11:56.810
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to go away for days at a time and</v>

3353
02:11:56.811 --> 02:11:59.270
<v Speaker 2>over research things and then write </v>
<v Speaker 2>these big 50,000 word articles.</v>

3354
02:11:59.710 --> 02:12:01.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm 50,000 words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3355
02:12:01.640 --> 02:12:03.260
<v Speaker 2>The history of not that kind of time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

3356
02:12:03.290 --> 02:12:03.960
<v Speaker 2>Well I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3357
02:12:03.960 --> 02:12:05.000
<v Speaker 2>I did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I carved it out.</v>

3358
02:12:05.150 --> 02:12:07.940
<v Speaker 2>But what about people reading it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was in five parts.</v>

3359
02:12:08.900 --> 02:12:09.733
<v Speaker 2>The history of naughty dog was like my </v>
<v Speaker 2>opus naughty dog's this very huge </v>

3360
02:12:12.321 --> 02:12:14.210
<v Speaker 2>actually in Santa Monica,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very huge game developer,</v>

3361
02:12:14.211 --> 02:12:15.170
<v Speaker 2>very talented game developer.</v>

3362
02:12:15.170 --> 02:12:18.350
<v Speaker 2>I went and talked at 19 people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got about a bunch of primary sources and</v>

3363
02:12:18.920 --> 02:12:20.930
<v Speaker 2>and all these things and wrote this </v>
<v Speaker 2>piece that I really cared about.</v>

3364
02:12:21.020 --> 02:12:22.490
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>

3365
02:12:22.510 --> 02:12:25.760
<v Speaker 2>but when I would write things like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>political correctness piece about,</v>

3366
02:12:26.220 --> 02:12:30.620
<v Speaker 2>let me give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a game that was canceled a maybe</v>

3367
02:12:30.621 --> 02:12:32.810
<v Speaker 2>five years ago or so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was pretty late in development.</v>

3368
02:12:32.960 --> 02:12:33.793
<v Speaker 2>So it's weird to have to cancel a when </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've already spent a bunch of money </v>

3369
02:12:35.271 --> 02:12:36.104
<v Speaker 2>on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was called six days in Fallujah and </v>

3370
02:12:38.781 --> 02:12:41.060
<v Speaker 2>it was a game about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was the third person shooter.</v>

3371
02:12:41.061 --> 02:12:42.220
<v Speaker 2>I think about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3372
02:12:42.710 --> 02:12:44.510
<v Speaker 2>the experience of Fallujah in Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3373
02:12:44.570 --> 02:12:46.340
<v Speaker 2>terrible conflict that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that happened there.</v>

3374
02:12:47.150 --> 02:12:49.940
<v Speaker 2>And people even on the right were </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting upset about being like,</v>

3375
02:12:49.941 --> 02:12:51.170
<v Speaker 2>it's too soon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3376
02:12:51.230 --> 02:12:52.063
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3377
02:12:52.150 --> 02:12:53.810
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is still ongoing,</v>

3378
02:12:53.990 --> 02:12:54.980
<v Speaker 2>how can you do?</v>

3379
02:12:55.220 --> 02:12:57.890
<v Speaker 2>And I wrote a piece being like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you all saying?</v>

3380
02:12:57.920 --> 02:12:59.540
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is awesome,</v>

3381
02:12:59.630 --> 02:13:02.320
<v Speaker 2>this is so great that someone wants to </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell a story like this and,</v>

3382
02:13:02.330 --> 02:13:03.163
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3383
02:13:03.270 --> 02:13:05.840
<v Speaker 2>and do something like this and you just </v>
<v Speaker 2>get it from all sides.</v>

3384
02:13:05.841 --> 02:13:07.460
<v Speaker 2>People will be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3385
02:13:07.490 --> 02:13:09.110
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not sensitive.</v>

3386
02:13:09.111 --> 02:13:10.520
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all of these kinds of things.</v>

3387
02:13:10.521 --> 02:13:12.710
<v Speaker 2>And then the girlfriend mode thing I </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrote about where people were like,</v>

3388
02:13:12.740 --> 02:13:13.573
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a sexist and blah blah blah blah </v>

3389
02:13:14.301 --> 02:13:14.691
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

3390
02:13:14.691 --> 02:13:15.524
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually just protecting the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sanctity of a man who might've made a </v>

3391
02:13:17.091 --> 02:13:18.650
<v Speaker 2>mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it,</v>

3392
02:13:18.840 --> 02:13:21.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of destroying him,</v>

3393
02:13:21.260 --> 02:13:24.310
<v Speaker 2>it goes back to this whole thing of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the last year that,</v>

3394
02:13:24.311 --> 02:13:25.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3395
02:13:25.210 --> 02:13:26.043
<v Speaker 2>the girlfriend mode,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the borderlands story I told you you </v>

3396
02:13:27.741 --> 02:13:28.574
<v Speaker 2>were with the guy and they were all </v>
<v Speaker 2>going after him and going after his job </v>

3397
02:13:30.711 --> 02:13:31.320
<v Speaker 2>and do these things.</v>

3398
02:13:31.320 --> 02:13:32.520
<v Speaker 2>And I wrote a piece being like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

3399
02:13:33.220 --> 02:13:35.450
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>know that he should have is a soft </v>

3401

<v Speaker 2>target and they just went after it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

3402
02:13:42.480 --> 02:13:43.313
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it reminds you that you experienced </v>

3403

<v Speaker 2>blowback.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Every time from that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3405
02:13:47.071 --> 02:13:48.420
<v Speaker 2>Every time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the blow back from that,</v>

3406
02:13:48.421 --> 02:13:49.830
<v Speaker 2>from you defending this guy saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3407
02:13:49.831 --> 02:13:52.260
<v Speaker 2>he just really fucked up the way he </v>
<v Speaker 2>described things,</v>

3408
02:13:52.261 --> 02:13:53.940
<v Speaker 2>but he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was an innocent in that regard.</v>

3409
02:13:53.970 --> 02:13:54.803
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you lose like social cache when every </v>

3410
02:13:56.011 --> 02:13:57.210
<v Speaker 2>time it's something like this would </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

3411
02:13:57.211 --> 02:13:58.044
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's why I say like this was the </v>

3412
02:13:59.581 --> 02:14:00.414
<v Speaker 2>moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the joke was the moment that they were </v>

3413
02:14:01.501 --> 02:14:02.334
<v Speaker 2>looking to pounce really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not saying that they were </v>

3414
02:14:03.421 --> 02:14:04.560
<v Speaker 2>calculating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's waiting,</v>

3415
02:14:04.561 --> 02:14:05.394
<v Speaker 2>but they saw an opportunity and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>took it because over time you lose </v>

3416
02:14:08.461 --> 02:14:11.510
<v Speaker 2>respect over people because of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>political stances.</v>

3417
02:14:11.520 --> 02:14:15.270
<v Speaker 2>He completely reasonable political </v>
<v Speaker 2>stances I think where they remember that</v>

3418
02:14:15.271 --> 02:14:17.940
<v Speaker 2>you said this and he said this and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>said this doesn't really,</v>

3419
02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:18.833
<v Speaker 2>you weren't really having debates with </v>
<v Speaker 2>people where you were disagreeing with </v>

3420
02:14:21.031 --> 02:14:21.864
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was simply a matter of reaction to </v>

3421
02:14:23.041 --> 02:14:23.874
<v Speaker 2>some of the things that you had written </v>
<v Speaker 2>where they were trying to box you into </v>

3422
02:14:25.861 --> 02:14:27.440
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a conservative group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3423
02:14:27.450 --> 02:14:28.850
<v Speaker 2>And they would call me in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3424
02:14:29.010 --> 02:14:30.570
<v Speaker 2>now it's like I'm a Nazi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm all right.</v>

3425
02:14:30.571 --> 02:14:31.231
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3426
02:14:31.231 --> 02:14:32.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I have one.</v>

3427
02:14:32.670 --> 02:14:33.503
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I've won outright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even really know what the alt </v>

3428
02:14:36.031 --> 02:14:37.380
<v Speaker 2>right means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like what,</v>

3429
02:14:37.430 --> 02:14:40.680
<v Speaker 2>like what is outright lying to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems like the far fringe is like the</v>

3430
02:14:40.681 --> 02:14:41.514
<v Speaker 2>Richard Spencer is of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Neo Nazis in the white supremacists </v>

3431
02:14:43.081 --> 02:14:44.660
<v Speaker 2>and the actual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3432
02:14:44.700 --> 02:14:46.000
<v Speaker 2>nationalists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

3433
02:14:46.050 --> 02:14:47.880
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as soon as you write alt on something,</v>

3434
02:14:47.881 --> 02:14:49.590
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it's a message board thing.</v>

3435
02:14:49.650 --> 02:14:50.490
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

3436
02:14:50.580 --> 02:14:51.413
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

3437
02:14:51.560 --> 02:14:52.920
<v Speaker 2>it's a reddit thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3438
02:14:53.550 --> 02:14:54.390
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3439
02:14:54.391 --> 02:14:55.680
<v Speaker 2>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alternative.</v>

3440
02:14:55.681 --> 02:14:57.000
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what is it?</v>

3441
02:14:57.430 --> 02:14:57.921
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3442
02:14:57.921 --> 02:14:58.754
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3443
02:15:00.140 --> 02:15:02.550
<v Speaker 2>I hope not based on their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>based on their,</v>

3444
02:15:02.580 --> 02:15:05.350
<v Speaker 2>based on their characterization of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to me.</v>

3445
02:15:05.450 --> 02:15:06.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go ahead.</v>

3446
02:15:06.060 --> 02:15:06.570
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3447
02:15:06.570 --> 02:15:07.940
<v Speaker 2>what is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

3448
02:15:08.070 --> 02:15:09.690
<v Speaker 2>how would they define you as being alt </v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3449
02:15:09.691 --> 02:15:12.120
<v Speaker 2>What would they say that you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>outright characteristics.</v>

3450
02:15:12.150 --> 02:15:13.600
<v Speaker 2>You can see these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3451
02:15:13.850 --> 02:15:14.683
<v Speaker 2>a message boards for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people were very supportive on </v>

3452
02:15:16.711 --> 02:15:17.544
<v Speaker 2>reddit and all these kinds of plays that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are a little more known for free </v>

3453
02:15:18.481 --> 02:15:19.950
<v Speaker 2>thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's this one video game,</v>

3454
02:15:20.060 --> 02:15:22.030
<v Speaker 2>a message board in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3455
02:15:22.410 --> 02:15:23.243
<v Speaker 2>that is just insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there was a hundred and 25 page or </v>

3456
02:15:27.211 --> 02:15:28.044
<v Speaker 2>so thread about me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 posts or I think it might even be 50 </v>

3457
02:15:30.121 --> 02:15:30.954
<v Speaker 2>posts the page and I was reading it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it hurts some of it because people are </v>

3458
02:15:34.951 --> 02:15:35.731
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

3459
02:15:35.731 --> 02:15:37.890
<v Speaker 2>people telling me I said things I never </v>
<v Speaker 2>said one thing.</v>

3460
02:15:38.130 --> 02:15:38.963
<v Speaker 2>People like Collins against his name is </v>
<v Speaker 2>no taxation is going to believe that </v>

3461
02:15:41.821 --> 02:15:42.654
<v Speaker 2>taxes should exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He often talk about how I really like </v>

3462
02:15:44.611 --> 02:15:46.140
<v Speaker 2>Ian Rand and I really like atlas </v>
<v Speaker 2>shrugged,</v>

3463
02:15:46.141 --> 02:15:47.580
<v Speaker 2>but I don't consider myself an </v>
<v Speaker 2>objectivist.</v>

3464
02:15:47.581 --> 02:15:49.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe that selfishness is </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily a virtue.</v>

3465
02:15:50.160 --> 02:15:52.740
<v Speaker 2>I just think she's interesting and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think some of our ideas are interesting.</v>

3466
02:15:53.040 --> 02:15:54.990
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God forbid I exist somewhere in the gray</v>

3467
02:15:54.991 --> 02:15:57.100
<v Speaker 2>area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're like collins and objective,</v>

3468
02:15:57.130 --> 02:15:58.890
<v Speaker 2>acidity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>selfish and blah blah blah.</v>

3469
02:15:58.891 --> 02:16:01.800
<v Speaker 2>And like collins a Nazi and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a racist.</v>

3470
02:16:01.801 --> 02:16:02.970
<v Speaker 2>He's a PSA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the term,</v>

3471
02:16:02.971 --> 02:16:05.040
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the news with soft racist or </v>
<v Speaker 2>soft bigot,</v>

3472
02:16:05.070 --> 02:16:07.060
<v Speaker 2>soft race being like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

3473
02:16:07.061 --> 02:16:07.894
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't intentionally or actually </v>

3474
02:16:09.601 --> 02:16:12.380
<v Speaker 2>overtly say anything but supports causes</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are racist or sexist.</v>

3475
02:16:12.600 --> 02:16:13.433
<v Speaker 2>These are the kinds of characterizations</v>
<v Speaker 2>that were going on basically people </v>

3476
02:16:15.511 --> 02:16:16.344
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

3477
02:16:16.350 --> 02:16:17.070
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

3478
02:16:17.070 --> 02:16:19.140
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on bulletin boards with,</v>

3479
02:16:19.170 --> 02:16:22.290
<v Speaker 2>with yarn and maps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's how I picture them,</v>

3480
02:16:22.291 --> 02:16:24.250
<v Speaker 2>like trying to make continuous </v>
<v Speaker 2>connections and,</v>

3481
02:16:24.470 --> 02:16:25.303
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's like these things aren't even </v>

3482
02:16:27.180 --> 02:16:30.070
<v Speaker 2>things I feel and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and things that I said or being</v>

3483
02:16:30.070 --> 02:16:32.020
<v Speaker 1>taken out of context.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I often use the,</v>

3484
02:16:32.050 --> 02:16:34.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm in video games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the big things is like,</v>

3485
02:16:34.770 --> 02:16:35.603
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a need for diverse casts and </v>

3486
02:16:36.991 --> 02:16:38.800
<v Speaker 1>diverse protagonists and stuff like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3487
02:16:39.100 --> 02:16:41.350
<v Speaker 1>And I often use the case that I used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>use the saying,</v>

3488
02:16:41.440 --> 02:16:43.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe in diversity for </v>
<v Speaker 1>diversity's sake.</v>

3489
02:16:43.930 --> 02:16:45.670
<v Speaker 1>I believe that an artist should tell his</v>
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>

3490
02:16:45.920 --> 02:16:47.260
<v Speaker 1>so of an artist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a writer,</v>

3491
02:16:47.261 --> 02:16:48.094
<v Speaker 1>and have a game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to have an all white cast and </v>

3492
02:16:49.181 --> 02:16:51.520
<v Speaker 1>that's what he thinks serves the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that makes them a racist.</v>

3493
02:16:51.880 --> 02:16:52.713
<v Speaker 1>If he wants to have an all Asian cast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that makes them a racist </v>

3494
02:16:54.761 --> 02:16:56.290
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what he wants to do.</v>

3495
02:16:56.730 --> 02:16:57.563
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people took that out of context and </v>

3496
02:16:58.841 --> 02:17:01.260
<v Speaker 1>we're calling me a racist and a bigot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all these kinds of things and it's,</v>

3497
02:17:01.261 --> 02:17:02.094
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hurtful because there's no one </v>

3498
02:17:02.621 --> 02:17:03.040
<v Speaker 1>there to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3499
02:17:03.040 --> 02:17:04.140
<v Speaker 1>No one's defending me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3500
02:17:04.180 --> 02:17:05.013
<v Speaker 1>and I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't defend myself because I'll just </v>

3501
02:17:05.801 --> 02:17:08.800
<v Speaker 1>make it worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was kind of like this hapless kind</v>

3502
02:17:08.801 --> 02:17:11.500
<v Speaker 1>of situation that I found myself in and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to make the best of it.</v>

3503
02:17:11.830 --> 02:17:16.720
<v Speaker 1>I had a debate once about that with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend who was an Asian actor and he was</v>

3504
02:17:16.721 --> 02:17:17.554
<v Speaker 1>talking about the lack of roles for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Asians in Hollywood and what a massive </v>

3505
02:17:21.071 --> 02:17:23.710
<v Speaker 1>issue is and you know that he wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>raise awareness of it.</v>

3506
02:17:24.130 --> 02:17:24.851
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

3507
02:17:24.851 --> 02:17:26.800
<v Speaker 1>but this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about a creative venture.</v>

3508
02:17:26.801 --> 02:17:28.540
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about somebody writing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

3509
02:17:28.560 --> 02:17:29.393
<v Speaker 1>Like I think the correct way to go about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is to try to figure out how to get </v>

3510
02:17:32.681 --> 02:17:36.370
<v Speaker 1>your own project through or someone else</v>
<v Speaker 1>who feels very strongly about this.</v>

3511
02:17:36.371 --> 02:17:37.204
<v Speaker 1>Trying to get their on project through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the right way is not for someone to </v>

3512
02:17:40.301 --> 02:17:41.134
<v Speaker 1>have to compromise their creative vision</v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to encompass the full spectrum </v>

3513
02:17:44.261 --> 02:17:46.780
<v Speaker 1>of races in whatever story they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing.</v>

3514
02:17:47.020 --> 02:17:47.853
<v Speaker 1>Like creative story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you want to write a story about </v>

3515
02:17:50.141 --> 02:17:52.630
<v Speaker 1>a small town in Maine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Stephen King has done so often,</v>

3516
02:17:52.870 --> 02:17:55.750
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't have to have 10 percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>Asians in that story.</v>

3517
02:17:55.810 --> 02:17:56.643
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just,</v>

3518
02:17:56.680 --> 02:17:59.410
<v Speaker 1>that's not what creativity is about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about,</v>

3519
02:17:59.440 --> 02:17:59.711
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

3520
02:17:59.711 --> 02:18:04.600
<v Speaker 1>there are places and people and the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to run into all black folks</v>

3521
02:18:04.840 --> 02:18:08.200
<v Speaker 1>or were you going to run into all </v>
<v Speaker 1>Norwegian people?</v>

3522
02:18:08.201 --> 02:18:09.034
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in those stories are just as valid as a </v>

3523
02:18:10.691 --> 02:18:12.670
<v Speaker 1>story that's fully diverse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3524
02:18:12.750 --> 02:18:13.583
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that that necessarily </v>

3525
02:18:14.171 --> 02:18:15.004
<v Speaker 1>makes anything better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I also think that when you're </v>

3526
02:18:17.861 --> 02:18:21.100
<v Speaker 1>talking about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're sort of talking about it.</v>

3527
02:18:21.101 --> 02:18:24.190
<v Speaker 1>Like there should be a quota,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3528
02:18:24.191 --> 02:18:29.020
<v Speaker 1>and like Hollywood should recognize the </v>
<v Speaker 1>need for these people to be in films and</v>

3529
02:18:29.021 --> 02:18:30.320
<v Speaker 1>movies and it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

3530
02:18:30.330 --> 02:18:31.163
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're making this politically correct </v>

3531
02:18:34.180 --> 02:18:35.230
<v Speaker 1>sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3532
02:18:36.120 --> 02:18:36.953
<v Speaker 1>be passing these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these judgements on this thing that is </v>

3533
02:18:39.881 --> 02:18:41.260
<v Speaker 1>all about imagination.</v>

3534
02:18:41.560 --> 02:18:43.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood essentially.</v>

3535
02:18:43.151 --> 02:18:45.210
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're making a television show,</v>

3536
02:18:45.240 --> 02:18:48.100
<v Speaker 1>are you making a movie is really about </v>
<v Speaker 1>an imagination.</v>

3537
02:18:48.101 --> 02:18:48.934
<v Speaker 1>It's about imagination and vision and </v>
<v Speaker 1>having that vision being entertaining </v>

3538
02:18:52.061 --> 02:18:55.630
<v Speaker 1>for people and if you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only want to write about the people that</v>

3539
02:18:55.631 --> 02:18:56.464
<v Speaker 1>you were in college with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were that you shared a dorm room </v>

3540
02:18:59.051 --> 02:18:59.884
<v Speaker 1>with you should be out aloud to and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a disproportionate amount of </v>

3541
02:19:03.521 --> 02:19:04.354
<v Speaker 1>people that are doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that happened to be white males that we </v>

3542
02:19:07.361 --> 02:19:08.194
<v Speaker 1>should probably try to figure out why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that you have to force </v>

3543
02:19:11.741 --> 02:19:15.280
<v Speaker 1>people to hire Asian folks or black </v>
<v Speaker 1>folks or women or whatever.</v>

3544
02:19:15.281 --> 02:19:16.900
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems so crazy to me.</v>

3545
02:19:17.160 --> 02:19:18.340
<v Speaker 1>Serve the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

3546
02:19:18.341 --> 02:19:21.610
<v Speaker 1>and to give you a little glimpse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to give you some context with what might</v>

3547
02:19:21.611 --> 02:19:22.444
<v Speaker 1>be going on in gaming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was this very popular game series </v>

3548
02:19:24.851 --> 02:19:25.684
<v Speaker 1>called the Witcher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is made by a Polish developer </v>

3549
02:19:27.080 --> 02:19:28.070
<v Speaker 1>called CD project.</v>

3550
02:19:28.510 --> 02:19:29.343
<v Speaker 2>I'm there in Warsaw and it's based on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fusion of like Polish kind of </v>

3551
02:19:33.530 --> 02:19:34.363
<v Speaker 2>identity with this famous book series </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's based on like kind of Polish or </v>

3552
02:19:38.070 --> 02:19:39.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like kind of the Lord of the rings,</v>

3553
02:19:39.321 --> 02:19:40.154
<v Speaker 2>but in Eastern Europe and one guy is </v>
<v Speaker 2>cartoon character that works at this </v>

3554
02:19:44.151 --> 02:19:48.500
<v Speaker 2>website called Polygon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In his review was talking about how uh,</v>

3555
02:19:49.460 --> 02:19:50.293
<v Speaker 2>there were no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was no diversity there and </v>

3556
02:19:52.940 --> 02:19:55.190
<v Speaker 2>everyone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

3557
02:19:55.191 --> 02:19:56.024
<v Speaker 2>it's Poland and it's based on Poland of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your life and it's about dragons and </v>

3558
02:20:01.191 --> 02:20:02.024
<v Speaker 2>like goblins and there's some white guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is like what you're upset </v>

3559
02:20:05.391 --> 02:20:06.201
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3560
02:20:06.201 --> 02:20:09.980
<v Speaker 2>and there's another guy making it and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think he's Slovakia and I don't want to.</v>

3561
02:20:10.310 --> 02:20:14.120
<v Speaker 2>Somewhere in eastern Europe making a </v>
<v Speaker 2>game called kingdom come deliverance and</v>

3562
02:20:14.121 --> 02:20:14.954
<v Speaker 2>it's supposed to be very realistic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at something like the 14th or 15th </v>

3563
02:20:17.001 --> 02:20:19.820
<v Speaker 2>century in that area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

3564
02:20:19.880 --> 02:20:20.691
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're complaining,</v>

3565
02:20:20.691 --> 02:20:22.160
<v Speaker 2>there's no diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no diversity.</v>

3566
02:20:22.160 --> 02:20:22.993
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was no black people in this area </v>

3567
02:20:26.480 --> 02:20:29.600
<v Speaker 2>in 1500.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to make a game that's true to</v>

3568
02:20:29.601 --> 02:20:30.190
<v Speaker 2>the air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that,</v>

3569
02:20:30.190 --> 02:20:32.660
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't make him a racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

3570
02:20:32.720 --> 02:20:35.000
<v Speaker 2>and these are the kinds of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is just the kind of bullshit.</v>

3571
02:20:35.001 --> 02:20:36.290
<v Speaker 2>That's why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you see this in movies,</v>

3572
02:20:36.291 --> 02:20:37.360
<v Speaker 2>you see this in TV shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3573
02:20:37.420 --> 02:20:38.750
<v Speaker 2>it's not exclusive to gaming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's.</v>

3574
02:20:39.200 --> 02:20:40.820
<v Speaker 2>But it's what I've had to deal with for </v>
<v Speaker 2>a long time.</v>

3575
02:20:40.821 --> 02:20:42.140
<v Speaker 2>And I'm just looking at the root of it </v>
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>

3576
02:20:42.150 --> 02:20:43.210
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's causing it?</v>

3577
02:20:43.240 --> 02:20:46.130
<v Speaker 2>Like why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why do people feel like they have to put</v>

3578
02:20:46.190 --> 02:20:50.570
<v Speaker 2>a black person in a game about Poland in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 15 hundreds or whatever it was.</v>

3579
02:20:50.810 --> 02:20:51.471
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3580
02:20:51.471 --> 02:20:53.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thankfully,</v>

3581
02:20:53.061 --> 02:20:54.500
<v Speaker 2>the people that make the games don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>care,</v>

3582
02:20:54.570 --> 02:20:55.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they're,</v>

3583
02:20:55.100 --> 02:20:56.090
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to make our game,</v>

3584
02:20:56.420 --> 02:20:57.253
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The people that are complaining about </v>

3585
02:20:58.401 --> 02:20:59.750
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are virtuous virtue signaling,</v>

3586
02:20:59.751 --> 02:21:02.840
<v Speaker 2>which is not even a term I even knew </v>
<v Speaker 2>what it meant until a few weeks ago.</v>

3587
02:21:02.900 --> 02:21:04.700
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard people throw that term around.</v>

3588
02:21:05.270 --> 02:21:06.530
<v Speaker 2>I didn't quite know what a man I looked </v>
<v Speaker 2>at it,</v>

3589
02:21:06.531 --> 02:21:08.030
<v Speaker 2>I looked into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3590
02:21:08.050 --> 02:21:08.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know what it is.</v>

3591
02:21:08.991 --> 02:21:11.360
<v Speaker 2>It's the idea that these virtuous </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

3592
02:21:11.361 --> 02:21:12.680
<v Speaker 2>it's the same people that attacked me </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the joke.</v>

3593
02:21:13.100 --> 02:21:16.190
<v Speaker 2>I have to be virtuous and show that I am</v>
<v Speaker 2>against sexism.</v>

3594
02:21:16.191 --> 02:21:18.050
<v Speaker 2>So I have to attack the man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3595
02:21:18.051 --> 02:21:20.530
<v Speaker 2>I have to do all these kinds of things </v>
<v Speaker 2>in this need,</v>

3596
02:21:20.600 --> 02:21:21.710
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what they're saying,</v>

3597
02:21:21.711 --> 02:21:22.370
<v Speaker 2>when they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they,</v>

3598
02:21:22.370 --> 02:21:26.300
<v Speaker 2>when they're saying we have to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>black people in this game,</v>

3599
02:21:27.260 --> 02:21:29.570
<v Speaker 2>in eastern Europe in the 15 hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they're saying,</v>

3600
02:21:29.600 --> 02:21:31.400
<v Speaker 2>what they're really saying is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a racist.</v>

3601
02:21:31.980 --> 02:21:32.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the,</v>

3602
02:21:32.720 --> 02:21:33.553
<v Speaker 2>that's the subtext.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it goes back to this character </v>

3603
02:21:34.881 --> 02:21:37.380
<v Speaker 2>assassination in this need to destroy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3604
02:21:37.460 --> 02:21:38.293
<v Speaker 2>I often use the example of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember when Gawker wrote about </v>

3605
02:21:40.490 --> 02:21:43.220
<v Speaker 2>Conde Nast as a CFO and outed them?</v>

3606
02:21:43.430 --> 02:21:44.780
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what that story is.</v>

3607
02:21:44.781 --> 02:21:48.170
<v Speaker 2>So sad story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's so on Gawker.</v>

3608
02:21:48.230 --> 02:21:51.860
<v Speaker 2>This guy wrote this story about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3609
02:21:52.110 --> 02:21:54.260
<v Speaker 2>the CFO of Conde Nast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that.</v>

3610
02:21:54.290 --> 02:21:56.810
<v Speaker 2>Conde Nast is like this big conglomerate</v>
<v Speaker 2>that owns a bunch of,</v>

3611
02:21:56.940 --> 02:21:57.890
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3612
02:21:57.891 --> 02:21:59.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>smaller businesses.</v>

3613
02:21:59.001 --> 02:21:59.990
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're pretty big company.</v>

3614
02:21:59.991 --> 02:22:00.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they,</v>

3615
02:22:00.990 --> 02:22:02.140
<v Speaker 2>I think they might even be in </v>
<v Speaker 2>publishing,</v>

3616
02:22:02.180 --> 02:22:03.013
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3617
02:22:03.710 --> 02:22:04.543
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3618
02:22:05.480 --> 02:22:08.690
<v Speaker 2>so they wrote this story and the entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>crux of the story.</v>

3619
02:22:08.691 --> 02:22:09.680
<v Speaker 2>This guy that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one,</v>

3620
02:22:09.750 --> 02:22:10.583
<v Speaker 2>this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think his brother or brother in law </v>

3621
02:22:12.440 --> 02:22:13.970
<v Speaker 2>with Timothy Geithner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's his,</v>

3622
02:22:13.971 --> 02:22:14.804
<v Speaker 2>that's his claim to fame I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's just a private citizen that </v>

3623
02:22:16.401 --> 02:22:21.110
<v Speaker 2>works as a cfo of a big corporation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They write this piece,</v>

3624
02:22:21.200 --> 02:22:22.033
<v Speaker 2>that outcome as a gay man that he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>having or trying to have an affair </v>

3625
02:22:24.861 --> 02:22:26.910
<v Speaker 2>behind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His wife's back with this guy,</v>

3626
02:22:27.600 --> 02:22:29.370
<v Speaker 2>all of this stuff just.</v>

3627
02:22:29.850 --> 02:22:30.840
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read this piece.</v>

3628
02:22:30.841 --> 02:22:33.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the purpose of this?</v>

3629
02:22:33.750 --> 02:22:35.370
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm sure Jamie,</v>

3630
02:22:35.371 --> 02:22:36.630
<v Speaker 2>if you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can probably find it.</v>

3631
02:22:36.760 --> 02:22:40.530
<v Speaker 2>I did the why did they write it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm clicks,</v>

3632
02:22:41.220 --> 02:22:41.621
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3633
02:22:41.621 --> 02:22:42.454
<v Speaker 2>and it actually blew up in their faces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are fucking furious about this </v>

3634
02:22:43.891 --> 02:22:47.550
<v Speaker 2>because this wasn't yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

3635
02:22:47.560 --> 02:22:49.350
<v Speaker 2>there's the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing,</v>

3636
02:22:49.351 --> 02:22:54.300
<v Speaker 2>it's like they just out this guy for no </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason to steroid his life.</v>

3637
02:22:54.390 --> 02:22:57.300
<v Speaker 2>Gawker on Thursday evening helped as </v>
<v Speaker 2>Grunfeld sex worker,</v>

3638
02:22:57.330 --> 02:23:00.750
<v Speaker 2>extort the chief financial officer at </v>
<v Speaker 2>Conde Nast and brother,</v>

3639
02:23:00.751 --> 02:23:03.000
<v Speaker 2>a former treasury,</v>
<v Speaker 2>treasury secretary,</v>

3640
02:23:03.240 --> 02:23:05.610
<v Speaker 2>Kim Geitner that has his name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tim Geithner.</v>

3641
02:23:05.611 --> 02:23:07.080
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jensen,</v>

3642
02:23:07.090 --> 02:23:07.923
<v Speaker 2>ing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any semblance of journalistic integrity </v>

3643
02:23:09.361 --> 02:23:11.550
<v Speaker 2>and likely ruining a man's life in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>process.</v>

3644
02:23:12.510 --> 02:23:13.343
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can go jump down the rabbit hole </v>

3645
02:23:14.461 --> 02:23:15.294
<v Speaker 2>this read about this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is such an example of outrage of </v>

3646
02:23:17.750 --> 02:23:18.040
<v Speaker 2>not even.</v>

3647
02:23:18.040 --> 02:23:21.150
<v Speaker 2>I already told you I've just character </v>
<v Speaker 2>assassination for sake to remember this.</v>

3648
02:23:21.210 --> 02:23:22.920
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm kind of remembering the story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost,</v>

3649
02:23:22.921 --> 02:23:25.500
<v Speaker 2>it's unfortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so many fucking crazy stories.</v>

3650
02:23:25.501 --> 02:23:25.921
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3651
02:23:25.921 --> 02:23:27.010
<v Speaker 2>it says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3652
02:23:27.480 --> 02:23:28.313
<v Speaker 2>he is married and has three children </v>
<v Speaker 2>allegedly arrange a night with a male </v>

3653
02:23:31.111 --> 02:23:31.944
<v Speaker 2>escort.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On a recent trip to Chicago when the </v>

3654
02:23:32.851 --> 02:23:33.684
<v Speaker 2>escort found out who the CFO was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he asked for help with an ongoing </v>

3655
02:23:36.511 --> 02:23:37.710
<v Speaker 2>housing dispute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

3656
02:23:37.711 --> 02:23:38.544
<v Speaker 2>trying to kick it to the government </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of his connection with Geitner </v>

3657
02:23:40.620 --> 02:23:41.011
<v Speaker 2>CFO.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Allegedly,</v>

3658
02:23:41.011 --> 02:23:42.330
<v Speaker 2>he got spooked and canceled their </v>
<v Speaker 2>meeting,</v>

3659
02:23:42.331 --> 02:23:43.164
<v Speaker 2>though he paid in full for the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for whatever rendezvous they were going </v>

3660
02:23:45.391 --> 02:23:47.610
<v Speaker 2>to have in retaliation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The escort went to Gawker,</v>

3661
02:23:47.730 --> 02:23:48.563
<v Speaker 2>which published the story despite </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowing that doing so would play into </v>

3662
02:23:50.491 --> 02:23:53.190
<v Speaker 2>the extortion attempts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The site also publish screenshots of the</v>

3663
02:23:53.191 --> 02:23:54.390
<v Speaker 2>pairs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alleged text message exchange,</v>

3664
02:23:54.391 --> 02:23:55.560
<v Speaker 2>including several photos.</v>

3665
02:23:56.160 --> 02:23:58.980
<v Speaker 2>They shook this guy down and ruined him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ruined him,</v>

3666
02:23:58.981 --> 02:23:59.814
<v Speaker 2>ruined you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably he's going to have problems </v>

3667
02:24:01.141 --> 02:24:02.850
<v Speaker 2>with his wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably get the forest now.</v>

3668
02:24:02.851 --> 02:24:03.684
<v Speaker 2>His kids are going to be in limbo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's gonna lose his job and he's got to </v>

3669
02:24:05.191 --> 02:24:07.230
<v Speaker 2>follow them around forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

3670
02:24:07.680 --> 02:24:09.240
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because he tried to,</v>

3671
02:24:09.380 --> 02:24:10.213
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not our business if he's cheating </v>

3672
02:24:10.801 --> 02:24:12.980
<v Speaker 2>on his wife and it's not our business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he's gay and it's our business,</v>

3673
02:24:12.981 --> 02:24:14.940
<v Speaker 2>if he's trying to have him be with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>male escort,</v>

3674
02:24:15.130 --> 02:24:16.620
<v Speaker 2>they saw clickbait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

3675
02:24:17.040 --> 02:24:18.780
<v Speaker 2>And this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is what it's all about.</v>

3676
02:24:18.781 --> 02:24:20.880
<v Speaker 2>It's to say I would even go further with</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gawker,</v>

3677
02:24:20.881 --> 02:24:23.250
<v Speaker 2>which obviously ended up taking him down</v>
<v Speaker 2>with Hulk Hogan.</v>

3678
02:24:23.550 --> 02:24:24.390
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

3679
02:24:24.780 --> 02:24:27.000
<v Speaker 2>Because he's a famous person to his sex </v>
<v Speaker 2>tape,</v>

3680
02:24:27.030 --> 02:24:27.863
<v Speaker 2>which is going to ruin his friendship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ruined his marriage and all of these </v>

3681
02:24:28.981 --> 02:24:29.814
<v Speaker 2>connections.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What kind of pleasure do you get out of </v>

3682
02:24:31.471 --> 02:24:32.070
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

3683
02:24:32.070 --> 02:24:35.180
<v Speaker 2>That goes back to the point I was making</v>
<v Speaker 2>about how I wouldn't write stories about</v>

3684
02:24:35.180 --> 02:24:37.320
<v Speaker 2>a couple people back in the day because </v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to ruin them.</v>

3685
02:24:38.340 --> 02:24:40.520
<v Speaker 2>That's not what I'm out to do and I feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

3686
02:24:40.550 --> 02:24:41.383
<v Speaker 2>So it all plays into the same culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same culture of character </v>

3687
02:24:44.341 --> 02:24:45.990
<v Speaker 2>assassination,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Neil puritanism,</v>

3688
02:24:45.991 --> 02:24:49.290
<v Speaker 2>witch hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>enjoying irresponsibility.</v>

3689
02:24:49.460 --> 02:24:50.293
<v Speaker 2>There's a responsibility that comes with</v>
<v Speaker 2>this that there's almost like a power </v>

3690
02:24:54.061 --> 02:24:54.894
<v Speaker 2>that has not been earned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This the power of whether it's social </v>

3691
02:24:57.511 --> 02:24:58.344
<v Speaker 2>media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's the ability to write blogs </v>

3692
02:24:59.341 --> 02:25:01.650
<v Speaker 2>about someone like that or whether it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>ability to,</v>

3693
02:25:01.980 --> 02:25:03.000
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to,</v>

3694
02:25:03.230 --> 02:25:07.530
<v Speaker 2>to make tweets and just a attack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone that this,</v>

3695
02:25:07.650 --> 02:25:10.020
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this ability is really very,</v>

3696
02:25:10.021 --> 02:25:13.050
<v Speaker 2>very new and the ability to mass </v>
<v Speaker 2>published,</v>

3697
02:25:13.051 --> 02:25:13.884
<v Speaker 2>like to make a tweet about a guy like </v>
<v Speaker 2>you just decide Collin Moriarty is a </v>

3698
02:25:17.281 --> 02:25:18.114
<v Speaker 2>piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe that joke fucking </v>

3699
02:25:20.551 --> 02:25:21.960
<v Speaker 2>sexist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then boom,</v>

3700
02:25:21.961 --> 02:25:24.010
<v Speaker 2>put that out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it gets retweeted over and</v>

3701
02:25:24.010 --> 02:25:24.843
<v Speaker 1>over again like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People don't necessarily understand the </v>

3702
02:25:27.311 --> 02:25:30.440
<v Speaker 1>repercussions of these actions that this</v>
<v Speaker 1>is like there,</v>

3703
02:25:30.450 --> 02:25:31.283
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an amount of power that they </v>

3704
02:25:32.561 --> 02:25:33.394
<v Speaker 1>really haven't earned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This amount of power and influence that </v>

3705
02:25:36.440 --> 02:25:39.940
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have in your ability to express</v>

3706
02:25:39.941 --> 02:25:42.010
<v Speaker 1>yourself today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a really new thing.</v>

3707
02:25:42.310 --> 02:25:44.380
<v Speaker 1>I look at it a little differently in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense that.</v>

3708
02:25:44.620 --> 02:25:46.390
<v Speaker 1>Because I think you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're onto something there,</v>

3709
02:25:46.630 --> 02:25:48.680
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's also the mob mentality </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's,</v>

3710
02:25:48.910 --> 02:25:53.170
<v Speaker 1>that exposes the fact that say I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>ruined forever.</v>

3711
02:25:53.290 --> 02:25:55.630
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they won whatever that means.</v>

3712
02:25:56.050 --> 02:25:56.950
<v Speaker 1>And then people go like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3713
02:25:56.951 --> 02:25:58.660
<v Speaker 1>you just ruin that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did you do that?</v>

3714
02:25:58.661 --> 02:25:59.494
<v Speaker 1>And they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3715
02:25:59.530 --> 02:26:00.363
<v Speaker 1>he did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3716
02:26:00.400 --> 02:26:01.121
<v Speaker 1>he did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3717
02:26:01.121 --> 02:26:01.840
<v Speaker 1>he did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did.</v>

3718
02:26:01.840 --> 02:26:03.400
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one's responsible for it.</v>

3719
02:26:03.700 --> 02:26:06.040
<v Speaker 1>And when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're in this mob,</v>

3720
02:26:06.041 --> 02:26:06.874
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's,</v>

3721
02:26:07.030 --> 02:26:07.863
<v Speaker 1>it's old fashioned witch hunting and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's done for strangely puritanical </v>

3722
02:26:11.261 --> 02:26:11.650
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>

3723
02:26:11.650 --> 02:26:12.483
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that there's also an </v>

3724
02:26:13.331 --> 02:26:15.910
<v Speaker 1>inclination to do it because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>worried that it's going to happen to you</v>

3725
02:26:15.940 --> 02:26:16.773
<v Speaker 1>and you want to attack first feel like </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's almost a thing where the people </v>

3726
02:26:19.151 --> 02:26:20.620
<v Speaker 1>want to take the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3727
02:26:20.910 --> 02:26:24.020
<v Speaker 1>the vision off of themselves or they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to take the,</v>

3728
02:26:24.070 --> 02:26:27.000
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the scrutiny of themselves point.</v>

3729
02:26:27.001 --> 02:26:27.834
<v Speaker 1>And when you pointed at someone else </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough and you keep pointing at other </v>

3730
02:26:29.681 --> 02:26:30.580
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they.</v>

3731
02:26:30.850 --> 02:26:33.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean eventually people kind of get it </v>
<v Speaker 1>after awhile,</v>

3732
02:26:33.910 --> 02:26:34.743
<v Speaker 1>but like is that a little expression </v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you want to look at like the </v>

3733
02:26:39.160 --> 02:26:40.090
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with girls,</v>

3734
02:26:40.091 --> 02:26:40.924
<v Speaker 1>it was always like the girls who would </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk shit about other girls being sluts </v>

3735
02:26:42.671 --> 02:26:44.230
<v Speaker 1>were always the biggest slots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3736
02:26:44.260 --> 02:26:45.093
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's this weird thing about </v>

3737
02:26:46.570 --> 02:26:51.570
<v Speaker 1>people where if you're going after folks</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of those sort of situations,</v>

3738
02:26:52.391 --> 02:26:55.540
<v Speaker 1>what you're trying to do is take some of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the eyes off of you.</v>

3739
02:26:56.140 --> 02:26:58.600
<v Speaker 1>I think that that's probably a huge </v>
<v Speaker 1>element of it.</v>

3740
02:26:58.690 --> 02:26:59.523
<v Speaker 1>I find it strange because I went about </v>
<v Speaker 1>my business in a different way for the </v>

3741
02:27:01.871 --> 02:27:03.160
<v Speaker 1>same reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that makes any sense.</v>

3742
02:27:03.161 --> 02:27:05.920
<v Speaker 1>So it's like I don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're making the argument,</v>

3743
02:27:05.921 --> 02:27:06.754
<v Speaker 1>which I think is true that it's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't pay attention to the man behind </v>

3744
02:27:08.111 --> 02:27:08.944
<v Speaker 1>the curtain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's all of this stuff over </v>

3745
02:27:10.301 --> 02:27:13.770
<v Speaker 1>there and my whole thing was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be involved in this,</v>

3746
02:27:13.910 --> 02:27:14.860
<v Speaker 1>get that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get that.</v>

3747
02:27:14.861 --> 02:27:16.870
<v Speaker 1>And I believe you that you don't want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be involved in that.</v>

3748
02:27:16.871 --> 02:27:17.704
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's very virtuous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's very nice that you think </v>

3749
02:27:20.321 --> 02:27:21.700
<v Speaker 1>the way you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's important,</v>

3750
02:27:22.100 --> 02:27:23.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's important that you,</v>

3751
02:27:23.430 --> 02:27:24.263
<v Speaker 1>you have this ability to express </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself and let people know that that </v>

3752
02:27:25.781 --> 02:27:26.614
<v Speaker 1>is a good way to look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the least amount of conflict that you </v>

3753
02:27:29.381 --> 02:27:30.214
<v Speaker 1>can go through life with the better </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be off as long as it's </v>

3754
02:27:33.080 --> 02:27:34.780
<v Speaker 1>in unnecessary conflict.</v>

3755
02:27:34.870 --> 02:27:36.640
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think in this situation,</v>

3756
02:27:36.641 --> 02:27:39.610
<v Speaker 1>this is clearly unnecessary conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3757
02:27:39.611 --> 02:27:40.690
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the,</v>

3758
02:27:40.720 --> 02:27:42.400
<v Speaker 1>that's the whole it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it causes this,</v>

3759
02:27:42.880 --> 02:27:43.713
<v Speaker 1>this rigorous kind of atmosphere where </v>
<v Speaker 1>we can see it in politics to where </v>

3760
02:27:48.100 --> 02:27:50.890
<v Speaker 1>everyone's mad about everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Donald trump reads everyone's mad.</v>

3761
02:27:51.070 --> 02:27:52.340
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump read the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3762
02:27:52.420 --> 02:27:52.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3763
02:27:52.980 --> 02:27:53.813
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the picture that's going around on CNN </v>

3764
02:27:54.481 --> 02:27:55.510
<v Speaker 1>and where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was literally like,</v>

3765
02:27:55.550 --> 02:27:59.080
<v Speaker 1>is Donald Trump afraid of stairs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was like the Kyron the lower third.</v>

3766
02:27:59.560 --> 02:28:00.393
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's like stairs and it's like furs </v>

3767
02:28:02.620 --> 02:28:03.430
<v Speaker 1>elevators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3768
02:28:03.430 --> 02:28:05.830
<v Speaker 1>He prefers gilded elevators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that they're,</v>

3769
02:28:05.850 --> 02:28:07.510
<v Speaker 1>they're serious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Real question.</v>

3770
02:28:07.511 --> 02:28:07.871
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3771
02:28:07.871 --> 02:28:08.990
<v Speaker 1>this is the kind of stuff that's going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

3772
02:28:08.991 --> 02:28:11.920
<v Speaker 1>And so when you say s,</v>
<v Speaker 1>t a I r or s,</v>

3773
02:28:11.930 --> 02:28:12.350
<v Speaker 1>t,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3774
02:28:12.350 --> 02:28:13.183
<v Speaker 1>stairs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you walk up and down and down and the </v>

3775
02:28:14.830 --> 02:28:16.880
<v Speaker 1>ars because it can be like the evil </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes.</v>

3776
02:28:18.160 --> 02:28:19.660
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me I'm like,</v>

3777
02:28:19.690 --> 02:28:20.111
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3778
02:28:20.111 --> 02:28:21.410
<v Speaker 1>and that's why it goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3779
02:28:21.480 --> 02:28:22.250
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact</v>

3780
02:28:22.250 --> 02:28:23.083
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think this is an important </v>

3781
02:28:23.301 --> 02:28:24.134
<v Speaker 2>component to maybe making you understand</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happened a little bit better </v>

3782
02:28:25.701 --> 02:28:27.260
<v Speaker 2>because you're not in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that ecosystem,</v>

3783
02:28:27.290 --> 02:28:29.810
<v Speaker 2>but I think you can relate because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're seeing it happen elsewhere,</v>

3784
02:28:30.320 --> 02:28:31.153
<v Speaker 2>is that the gaming media is dying and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're dying because no one really </v>

3785
02:28:35.841 --> 02:28:36.674
<v Speaker 2>trusts or cares.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trust them or cares what they have to </v>

3786
02:28:38.391 --> 02:28:39.800
<v Speaker 2>say anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People.</v>

3787
02:28:39.980 --> 02:28:42.080
<v Speaker 2>Ten year olds and 15 year olds today are</v>
<v Speaker 2>not growing up being like,</v>

3788
02:28:42.081 --> 02:28:44.540
<v Speaker 2>I wonder what polygon has to say about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the newest game.</v>

3789
02:28:44.541 --> 02:28:47.870
<v Speaker 2>They go to youtube and find a guy there </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they trust and believe,</v>

3790
02:28:48.200 --> 02:28:49.033
<v Speaker 2>which is why the only people unanimously</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty much that came out in my defense </v>

3791
02:28:51.201 --> 02:28:52.034
<v Speaker 2>where you tubers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they know that they're the next </v>

3792
02:28:54.920 --> 02:28:55.753
<v Speaker 2>rung of this evolution of the way we </v>
<v Speaker 2>absorb and communicate and absorb </v>

3793
02:28:59.031 --> 02:28:59.864
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And have news meanwhile these people to </v>

3794
02:29:01.491 --> 02:29:02.510
<v Speaker 2>your point or writing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clickbait,</v>

3795
02:29:02.511 --> 02:29:03.344
<v Speaker 2>trying to stay relevant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no one really cares what they're </v>

3796
02:29:04.491 --> 02:29:06.230
<v Speaker 2>saying anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they're in their death throws.</v>

3797
02:29:06.590 --> 02:29:09.020
<v Speaker 2>This is a way for them to take shots at </v>
<v Speaker 2>multiple people at the same time.</v>

3798
02:29:09.021 --> 02:29:10.250
<v Speaker 2>This is what they did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Pewdie Pie.</v>

3799
02:29:10.251 --> 02:29:12.530
<v Speaker 2>This is what they did to other people </v>
<v Speaker 2>and put pie.</v>

3800
02:29:12.531 --> 02:29:14.540
<v Speaker 2>One was really egregious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was agreed to split.</v>

3801
02:29:14.570 --> 02:29:15.403
<v Speaker 2>But like again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of that stuff was taken out of </v>

3802
02:29:17.691 --> 02:29:18.524
<v Speaker 2>context and a lot of auto mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pewdiepie always agreed the attacks on </v>

3803
02:29:22.521 --> 02:29:22.880
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3804
02:29:22.880 --> 02:29:24.710
<v Speaker 2>it was terrible what Wall Street Journal</v>
<v Speaker 2>did to him.</v>

3805
02:29:24.860 --> 02:29:25.693
<v Speaker 2>This is just the sign of the Times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are people fighting and I really </v>

3806
02:29:28.041 --> 02:29:28.874
<v Speaker 2>feel this way and you might disagree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I feel like a lot of it is these </v>

3807
02:29:31.011 --> 02:29:32.930
<v Speaker 2>people are fighting for their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I were,</v>

3808
02:29:32.960 --> 02:29:35.320
<v Speaker 2>if I were a person that was trending up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold on a journalist.</v>

3809
02:29:35.321 --> 02:29:36.050
<v Speaker 2>The journalist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3810
02:29:36.050 --> 02:29:37.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if I were.</v>

3811
02:29:37.071 --> 02:29:41.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry to to interrupt you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I were right,</v>

3812
02:29:41.090 --> 02:29:43.370
<v Speaker 2>if I had written in the video game </v>
<v Speaker 2>industry for 10 years,</v>

3813
02:29:43.430 --> 02:29:43.790
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3814
02:29:43.790 --> 02:29:45.530
<v Speaker 2>I wrote the gaming industry for 14 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

3815
02:29:45.710 --> 02:29:46.543
<v Speaker 2>but how is a 10 year industry veteran </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I had fewer than 10,000 twitter </v>

3816
02:29:50.751 --> 02:29:51.584
<v Speaker 2>followers and I'm writing for a site.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one reads and I'm trying my hardest </v>

3817
02:29:54.710 --> 02:29:55.543
<v Speaker 2>to stay relevant and to do my thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be pretty mad too if I saw a guy </v>

3818
02:29:58.461 --> 02:30:02.120
<v Speaker 2>that turns on his camera and speaks </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever he wants and gets the amount of</v>

3819
02:30:02.121 --> 02:30:04.490
<v Speaker 2>views in 30 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I'll get the entire year.</v>

3820
02:30:04.520 --> 02:30:06.440
<v Speaker 2>Why would you be men?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it's nothing to do with you,</v>

3821
02:30:06.540 --> 02:30:07.373
<v Speaker 2>but what does it has a lot to do with </v>
<v Speaker 2>you because there's only so much time </v>

3822
02:30:09.051 --> 02:30:09.884
<v Speaker 2>and space for these people to absorb </v>
<v Speaker 2>things and they'd rather famine </v>

3823
02:30:11.601 --> 02:30:13.110
<v Speaker 2>mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd rather go to youtube.</v>

3824
02:30:13.170 --> 02:30:15.680
<v Speaker 2>Three hundred and $50.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Million people in this country alone and</v>

3825
02:30:15.681 --> 02:30:17.870
<v Speaker 2>there's many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many more people over over the world.</v>

3826
02:30:17.990 --> 02:30:22.160
<v Speaker 2>The idea that anybody's views is somehow</v>
<v Speaker 2>or another taking away from your views.</v>

3827
02:30:22.300 --> 02:30:23.133
<v Speaker 2>It was just straight famine mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Has plenty of eyes to go around and </v>

3828
02:30:25.881 --> 02:30:28.070
<v Speaker 2>you're showing it right now with your </v>
<v Speaker 2>new project.</v>

3829
02:30:28.100 --> 02:30:29.870
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm just like.</v>

3830
02:30:29.990 --> 02:30:33.020
<v Speaker 2>But I'm just saying like their.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their thought process sucks.</v>

3831
02:30:33.140 --> 02:30:33.973
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and extensively it's actually adding to </v>

3832
02:30:35.841 --> 02:30:36.674
<v Speaker 2>their destruction because people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at this like the media for </v>

3833
02:30:39.591 --> 02:30:41.330
<v Speaker 2>instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in political and the political landscape</v>

3834
02:30:41.331 --> 02:30:43.370
<v Speaker 2>is dying anyway that the decline is </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>

3835
02:30:43.380 --> 02:30:44.213
<v Speaker 2>Wall Street Journal put up a piece not </v>
<v Speaker 2>too long ago saying that per capita of </v>

3836
02:30:47.600 --> 02:30:50.390
<v Speaker 2>viewership on television is actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>starting to be outpaced by youtube.</v>

3837
02:30:50.840 --> 02:30:52.130
<v Speaker 2>So that's over now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3838
02:30:52.131 --> 02:30:54.890
<v Speaker 2>So like now that's not on video online </v>
<v Speaker 2>or video on demand.</v>

3839
02:30:54.891 --> 02:30:55.724
<v Speaker 2>That's just youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so people are looking at the </v>

3840
02:30:58.101 --> 02:30:58.934
<v Speaker 2>situation and actually precipitated that</v>
<v Speaker 2>happening quicker because in order to </v>

3841
02:31:02.031 --> 02:31:04.370
<v Speaker 2>stay relevant they lie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are they pieces?</v>

3842
02:31:04.371 --> 02:31:06.770
<v Speaker 2>I think we should talk about what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened with [inaudible].</v>

3843
02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:07.833
<v Speaker 2>Most people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who the fuck is put shy and what </v>

3844
02:31:09.381 --> 02:31:10.214
<v Speaker 2>happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

3845
02:31:10.490 --> 02:31:13.290
<v Speaker 2>Do you want me to send it to you have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do is so pewdie pie is,</v>

3846
02:31:13.310 --> 02:31:18.310
<v Speaker 2>is the biggest youtuber in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has 55 million subscribers and he's a</v>

3847
02:31:18.471 --> 02:31:21.180
<v Speaker 2>millionaire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just to be clear,</v>

3848
02:31:21.181 --> 02:31:22.530
<v Speaker 2>I've never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really know him very well.</v>

3849
02:31:22.531 --> 02:31:24.300
<v Speaker 2>I think I've had one or two communicates</v>
<v Speaker 2>with him at some point,</v>

3850
02:31:24.301 --> 02:31:24.840
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3851
02:31:24.840 --> 02:31:25.321
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3852
02:31:25.321 --> 02:31:26.460
<v Speaker 2>so I don't really have a horse in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>race.</v>

3853
02:31:27.040 --> 02:31:28.530
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he lives in Europe.</v>

3854
02:31:28.531 --> 02:31:29.364
<v Speaker 2>He lives in England,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's Swedish or something of </v>

3855
02:31:31.291 --> 02:31:32.124
<v Speaker 2>that nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he lives in England and he has a </v>

3856
02:31:34.441 --> 02:31:36.450
<v Speaker 2>massive youtube following me in every </v>
<v Speaker 2>video he does.</v>

3857
02:31:36.451 --> 02:31:37.650
<v Speaker 2>We'll have 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>12,</v>

3858
02:31:37.651 --> 02:31:39.860
<v Speaker 2>15 million views and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're on youtube.</v>

3859
02:31:39.861 --> 02:31:42.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm on youtube and a much lesser sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a lot of use.</v>

3860
02:31:43.500 --> 02:31:44.333
<v Speaker 2>And he pushed the boundaries in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways and some tasteless ways as this is </v>

3861
02:31:49.321 --> 02:31:50.154
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the thing that really caught on was </v>

3862
02:31:51.931 --> 02:31:54.530
<v Speaker 2>that he was using this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this app or this,</v>

3863
02:31:54.531 --> 02:31:55.950
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this service called Fiverr,</v>

3864
02:31:56.370 --> 02:31:57.203
<v Speaker 2>which is this kind of task rabbit kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of thing where it's like you can pay </v>

3865
02:31:59.371 --> 02:32:02.130
<v Speaker 2>people to do whatever you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any paid.</v>

3866
02:32:02.990 --> 02:32:04.530
<v Speaker 2>Some of the things he did were </v>
<v Speaker 2>otherwise,</v>

3867
02:32:04.531 --> 02:32:06.840
<v Speaker 2>but he paid these guys and some country </v>
<v Speaker 2>to hold up these,</v>

3868
02:32:06.841 --> 02:32:07.674
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like death to all Jews signs or </v>

3869
02:32:09.541 --> 02:32:11.750
<v Speaker 2>something like that as part of a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3870
02:32:12.120 --> 02:32:13.110
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3871
02:32:13.111 --> 02:32:14.790
<v Speaker 2>and that's something I think is somewhat</v>
<v Speaker 2>tasteless,</v>

3872
02:32:15.420 --> 02:32:17.310
<v Speaker 2>but he's trying to make a point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever point he was trying to make,</v>

3873
02:32:17.311 --> 02:32:18.144
<v Speaker 2>he's trying to make a point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was lost on a lot of people and this </v>

3874
02:32:19.441 --> 02:32:20.274
<v Speaker 2>combined with some other imagery he had </v>
<v Speaker 2>been using some kind of fascist or Nazi </v>

3875
02:32:23.191 --> 02:32:25.290
<v Speaker 2>imagery and some other things that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>been going on over the months.</v>

3876
02:32:25.410 --> 02:32:26.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you want.</v>

3877
02:32:26.890 --> 02:32:27.810
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you about to say something.</v>

3878
02:32:27.820 --> 02:32:29.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

3879
02:32:29.370 --> 02:32:30.203
<v Speaker 2>so eventually the Wall Street Journal </v>
<v Speaker 2>caught wind of this Wall Street Journal </v>

3880
02:32:33.061 --> 02:32:35.190
<v Speaker 2>obviously have a prolific right of </v>
<v Speaker 2>center,</v>

3881
02:32:35.191 --> 02:32:37.530
<v Speaker 2>but still pretty moderate newspaper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3882
02:32:37.620 --> 02:32:40.500
<v Speaker 2>and basically went after,</v>
<v Speaker 2>been tried to basically tried to destroy</v>

3883
02:32:40.520 --> 02:32:43.260
<v Speaker 2>him and took a lot of things out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>context.</v>

3884
02:32:43.261 --> 02:32:44.094
<v Speaker 2>Then forced Disney's Disney owns a </v>
<v Speaker 2>studio that funds him and all these </v>

3885
02:32:48.541 --> 02:32:49.374
<v Speaker 2>kinds of things and caused a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>personal and economic destruction for </v>

3886
02:32:51.271 --> 02:32:52.104
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like they intentionally took </v>

3887
02:32:52.501 --> 02:32:53.334
<v Speaker 2>things out of context too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they distorted the actual intent of </v>

3888
02:32:55.741 --> 02:32:58.860
<v Speaker 2>what he was trying to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially with telling people to not be</v>

3889
02:32:58.861 --> 02:32:59.694
<v Speaker 2>Nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was mocking people that were being </v>

3890
02:33:02.041 --> 02:33:05.550
<v Speaker 2>Nazis and they used that to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy is pretending to be a Nazi.</v>

3891
02:33:05.640 --> 02:33:06.473
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a completely dishonest hit piece </v>

3892
02:33:07.800 --> 02:33:12.070
<v Speaker 2>in the same vein as the conde nast hit </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same vein as the whole Cogan head is</v>

3893
02:33:12.080 --> 02:33:12.870
<v Speaker 2>the same.</v>

3894
02:33:12.870 --> 02:33:13.521
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3895
02:33:13.521 --> 02:33:14.640
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's these people,</v>

3896
02:33:14.670 --> 02:33:15.503
<v Speaker 2>they know the term punching up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to punch up and they think </v>

3897
02:33:16.951 --> 02:33:17.784
<v Speaker 2>they're punching up Wall Street </v>
<v Speaker 2>Journal's punching up now on youtube </v>

3898
02:33:19.240 --> 02:33:20.073
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but really caused a lot hilarious </v>

3899
02:33:21.870 --> 02:33:24.640
<v Speaker 2>punching up on a youtuber.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the way they look at it as not an</v>

3900
02:33:24.641 --> 02:33:25.380
<v Speaker 2>awareness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

3901
02:33:25.380 --> 02:33:28.320
<v Speaker 2>This guy's a youtuber.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a guy by himself.</v>

3902
02:33:28.321 --> 02:33:29.154
<v Speaker 2>You're punching up to attack him because</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the king because he's the media </v>

3903
02:33:32.071 --> 02:33:33.720
<v Speaker 2>elite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's the media elite.</v>

3904
02:33:33.721 --> 02:33:37.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like an independent reporter</v>
<v Speaker 2>attacking the ABC news or something like</v>

3905
02:33:37.651 --> 02:33:38.430
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

3906
02:33:38.430 --> 02:33:39.960
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to me it was like,</v>

3907
02:33:39.961 --> 02:33:40.794
<v Speaker 2>it showed a lot of cowardice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It showed a lot of half cocked thinking </v>

3908
02:33:44.071 --> 02:33:44.904
<v Speaker 2>on there on the Wall Street Journal's </v>
<v Speaker 2>part to think that this was going to </v>

3909
02:33:45.961 --> 02:33:46.794
<v Speaker 2>blow back on them and it showed a level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I hate using this word because I </v>

3910
02:33:50.401 --> 02:33:51.234
<v Speaker 2>don't think innately it's necessarily a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad thing because I think it drives you </v>

3911
02:33:53.041 --> 02:33:53.874
<v Speaker 2>forward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a level of jealousy at play </v>

3912
02:33:55.171 --> 02:33:56.640
<v Speaker 2>with a lot of these kinds of things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are happening.</v>

3913
02:33:56.730 --> 02:33:57.563
<v Speaker 2>What you were thinking about before when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were saying that someone who is </v>

3914
02:33:59.701 --> 02:34:00.534
<v Speaker 2>struggling to get 10,000 views and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>story they write is going to look at a </v>

3915
02:34:03.961 --> 02:34:07.230
<v Speaker 2>guy like this that can do one video </v>
<v Speaker 2>where he talks about farts and he makes,</v>

3916
02:34:07.650 --> 02:34:08.483
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his 7 million views or something like </v>

3917
02:34:09.901 --> 02:34:10.734
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He makes 15 million a year or whatever </v>

3918
02:34:12.160 --> 02:34:13.710
<v Speaker 2>and they're met and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand it.</v>

3919
02:34:13.890 --> 02:34:15.060
<v Speaker 2>And I get that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3920
02:34:15.061 --> 02:34:17.440
<v Speaker 2>I look at some people that are famous </v>
<v Speaker 2>are some that are,</v>

3921
02:34:17.441 --> 02:34:18.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a platform and I'm like,</v>

3922
02:34:18.461 --> 02:34:19.294
<v Speaker 2>I don't get this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not going to like sit here and </v>

3923
02:34:20.261 --> 02:34:22.150
<v Speaker 2>like rain on their parade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's their right.</v>

3924
02:34:22.151 --> 02:34:23.740
<v Speaker 2>They have an audience that's totally </v>
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>

3925
02:34:23.920 --> 02:34:25.990
<v Speaker 2>Maybe look at yourself and why you don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>have an audience.</v>

3926
02:34:25.991 --> 02:34:28.750
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you look at yourself and realize </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you have you been doing this for so</v>

3927
02:34:28.751 --> 02:34:29.950
<v Speaker 2>long and you're so proud of that.</v>

3928
02:34:30.160 --> 02:34:32.800
<v Speaker 2>Why isn't anyone listening to you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could it be you,</v>

3929
02:34:33.280 --> 02:34:35.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of instead of looking around for</v>

3930
02:34:35.741 --> 02:34:36.574
<v Speaker 2>people to assassinate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what's basically happening </v>

3931
02:34:38.201 --> 02:34:39.330
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3932
02:34:39.790 --> 02:34:41.620
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find it's so distasteful.</v>

3933
02:34:41.621 --> 02:34:42.454
<v Speaker 2>I find it's so destructive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're at the precipice of a very </v>

3934
02:34:43.871 --> 02:34:47.680
<v Speaker 2>dangerous time because the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the trust in institutions,</v>

3935
02:34:47.681 --> 02:34:50.500
<v Speaker 2>no matter where you are now is just lost</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of it has to do.</v>

3936
02:34:50.501 --> 02:34:51.260
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

3937
02:34:51.260 --> 02:34:52.093
<v Speaker 2>that's what I was saying with media </v>
<v Speaker 2>precipitating the fall by not telling </v>

3938
02:34:55.961 --> 02:34:56.794
<v Speaker 2>the truth by not doing the right thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the media in terms of pull it </v>

3939
02:35:01.060 --> 02:35:01.893
<v Speaker 2>politics for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is really rebounding from the fact that </v>

3940
02:35:03.521 --> 02:35:04.354
<v Speaker 2>they thought Clinton was gonna win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they thought they can get away with </v>

3941
02:35:05.741 --> 02:35:08.440
<v Speaker 2>saying and doing anything for that means</v>
<v Speaker 2>to an end.</v>

3942
02:35:08.890 --> 02:35:10.480
<v Speaker 2>The Donna Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>

3943
02:35:10.630 --> 02:35:15.520
<v Speaker 2>where she was feeding questions to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Clinton campaign is so incredible.</v>

3944
02:35:15.940 --> 02:35:19.810
<v Speaker 2>So shows such a level of bias and </v>
<v Speaker 2>systemic inherent bias.</v>

3945
02:35:20.260 --> 02:35:21.470
<v Speaker 2>They thought they were going to get away</v>
<v Speaker 2>with all of it.</v>

3946
02:35:21.490 --> 02:35:23.260
<v Speaker 2>Now no one trusts anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I see all this stuff,</v>

3947
02:35:23.261 --> 02:35:24.094
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what's going on with Russia</v>
<v Speaker 2>and trump for all I know he could be a </v>

3948
02:35:25.841 --> 02:35:27.670
<v Speaker 2>fucking Manchurian candidate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3949
02:35:27.970 --> 02:35:30.800
<v Speaker 2>but I don't believe a word they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3950
02:35:30.830 --> 02:35:31.663
<v Speaker 2>like when I read this about Paul </v>
<v Speaker 2>Manafort about Flynn about blah blah </v>

3951
02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:34.451
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah blah.</v>

3952
02:35:34.451 --> 02:35:35.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3953
02:35:35.040 --> 02:35:35.873
<v Speaker 2>You will have about all this other shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea what you're talking </v>

3954
02:35:36.731 --> 02:35:37.450
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3955
02:35:37.450 --> 02:35:39.880
<v Speaker 2>I have to really do my own research.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know who to trust anymore.</v>

3956
02:35:40.090 --> 02:35:42.970
<v Speaker 2>They did that to themselves and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>precipitated their own downfall.</v>

3957
02:35:43.120 --> 02:35:46.330
<v Speaker 2>More and more people are going on </v>
<v Speaker 2>youtube to listen to people like you,</v>

3958
02:35:46.510 --> 02:35:47.320
<v Speaker 2>to listen to people.</v>

3959
02:35:47.320 --> 02:35:48.153
<v Speaker 2>Even like Alex Jones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So listen to Dave Rubin to listen to </v>

3960
02:35:49.870 --> 02:35:50.703
<v Speaker 2>that problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is a problem because usually if you </v>

3961
02:35:52.511 --> 02:35:53.480
<v Speaker 2>listened in to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you,</v>

3962
02:35:53.600 --> 02:35:55.960
<v Speaker 2>it's a problem because you need people </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the trenches that you trust.</v>

3963
02:35:55.961 --> 02:35:57.490
<v Speaker 2>You need someone in the press room at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the White House,</v>

3964
02:35:57.491 --> 02:35:59.680
<v Speaker 2>you need someone in the app that is on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the wire,</v>

3965
02:35:59.681 --> 02:36:00.514
<v Speaker 2>that is telling you the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you can't even trust them </v>

3966
02:36:02.681 --> 02:36:03.514
<v Speaker 2>anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3967
02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:04.833
<v Speaker 2>That's a big problem and that's when </v>
<v Speaker 2>people go seek out alternative sources </v>

3968
02:36:07.301 --> 02:36:08.134
<v Speaker 2>of news and information and </v>
<v Speaker 2>entertainment and that's what's </v>

3969
02:36:09.551 --> 02:36:10.810
<v Speaker 2>happening and that's why they're dying.</v>

3970
02:36:10.850 --> 02:36:11.301
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3971
02:36:11.301 --> 02:36:15.350
<v Speaker 3>in many ways that you sure that big </v>
<v Speaker 3>corporate model is in ensuring their own</v>

3972
02:36:15.351 --> 02:36:16.184
<v Speaker 3>demise.</v>

3973
02:36:16.400 --> 02:36:17.780
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and and it's,</v>

3974
02:36:17.960 --> 02:36:19.940
<v Speaker 2>it's the race for clicks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the race for money.</v>

3975
02:36:19.941 --> 02:36:22.070
<v Speaker 2>It's the race for prominence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the race for relevance</v>

3976
02:36:22.460 --> 02:36:23.293
<v Speaker 3>and not honesty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not transparency and not a real </v>

3977
02:36:26.931 --> 02:36:31.400
<v Speaker 3>objective sense of what the truth is and</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the actual facts of a story are.</v>

3978
02:36:31.700 --> 02:36:32.533
<v Speaker 3>That's where journalism is a different </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing now because it's now a </v>

3979
02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:38.840
<v Speaker 3>entertainment show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an entertainment show that also has</v>

3980
02:36:38.841 --> 02:36:41.180
<v Speaker 3>the news in it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's why the women are so hot.</v>

3981
02:36:41.450 --> 02:36:42.283
<v Speaker 3>That's why the women on Fox News are </v>
<v Speaker 3>wearing these tiny little dresses and </v>

3982
02:36:45.021 --> 02:36:45.854
<v Speaker 3>they have beautiful legs and heels on </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're talking about important </v>

3983
02:36:49.041 --> 02:36:49.874
<v Speaker 3>issues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're giving you a little bit an </v>

3984
02:36:50.400 --> 02:36:51.450
<v Speaker 3>Icandy why?</v>

3985
02:36:52.040 --> 02:36:53.110
<v Speaker 2>So transparency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I see,</v>

3986
02:36:53.111 --> 02:36:53.980
<v Speaker 2>that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3987
02:36:54.050 --> 02:36:54.883
<v Speaker 2>it was a very attractive woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure she knows what she's talking </v>

3988
02:36:56.411 --> 02:36:57.244
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I know why.</v>

3989
02:36:57.460 --> 02:36:58.840
<v Speaker 2>I know why she sits at the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>table.</v>

3990
02:36:58.900 --> 02:36:59.780
<v Speaker 2>I liked when they were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're aggressive</v>

3991
02:36:59.790 --> 02:37:03.090
<v Speaker 3>to look Megan Kelly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's attractive and she's aggressive.</v>

3992
02:37:03.250 --> 02:37:04.740
<v Speaker 3>She's smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what makes her sexy.</v>

3993
02:37:04.860 --> 02:37:06.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Talking about,</v>

3994
02:37:06.390 --> 02:37:08.040
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

3995
02:37:08.250 --> 02:37:08.991
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're,</v>

3996
02:37:08.991 --> 02:37:09.970
<v Speaker 3>we're in this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're in this,</v>

3997
02:37:10.020 --> 02:37:11.300
<v Speaker 3>we're in this weird space,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3998
02:37:11.630 --> 02:37:13.230
<v Speaker 3>we're in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is just very bizarre space.</v>

3999
02:37:13.231 --> 02:37:14.064
<v Speaker 3>Do you feel like this is like an almost </v>
<v Speaker 3>an period in human communication that </v>

4000
02:37:17.031 --> 02:37:19.690
<v Speaker 3>we're going through this weird growth </v>
<v Speaker 3>period where we're,</v>

4001
02:37:19.691 --> 02:37:23.000
<v Speaker 3>we have this incredible access to </v>
<v Speaker 3>information and the ability to spread it</v>

4002
02:37:23.030 --> 02:37:23.863
<v Speaker 3>like we have now with social media and </v>
<v Speaker 3>with youtube and all these different </v>

4003
02:37:26.811 --> 02:37:27.644
<v Speaker 3>things where anybody can kind of hop in </v>
<v Speaker 3>and all of a sudden get a platform like </v>

4004
02:37:30.171 --> 02:37:34.310
<v Speaker 3>this pd peg guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pewdie pie wasn't a star,</v>

4005
02:37:34.311 --> 02:37:36.620
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't a politician.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't an actor before this.</v>

4006
02:37:36.800 --> 02:37:37.633
<v Speaker 3>It was just a guy and he connected with </v>
<v Speaker 3>people and carved out this path for </v>

4007
02:37:40.671 --> 02:37:43.490
<v Speaker 3>himself and pretty much anybody can kind</v>
<v Speaker 3>of do that now.</v>

4008
02:37:43.491 --> 02:37:45.200
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not easy.</v>

4009
02:37:45.230 --> 02:37:46.490
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it was easy,</v>

4010
02:37:46.491 --> 02:37:47.324
<v Speaker 3>everyone would do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it is not insurmountable and I </v>

4011
02:37:50.361 --> 02:37:51.194
<v Speaker 3>wonder what the next stage is in terms </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the ability to share information if </v>

4012
02:37:55.011 --> 02:37:58.700
<v Speaker 3>it's going to change past where it's at </v>
<v Speaker 3>now and get to some new level.</v>

4013
02:37:59.080 --> 02:37:59.581
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

4014
02:37:59.581 --> 02:38:00.414
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right in the sense that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Internet specifically had taken off </v>

4015
02:38:02.411 --> 02:38:05.470
<v Speaker 2>so quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The World Wide Web is only 24 years old.</v>

4016
02:38:05.471 --> 02:38:06.304
<v Speaker 2>The Internet's way older,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the way we communicate with each </v>

4017
02:38:07.811 --> 02:38:08.644
<v Speaker 2>other now is so different than even use </v>
<v Speaker 2>net in the eighties or these kind of </v>

4018
02:38:13.510 --> 02:38:14.343
<v Speaker 2>university university communications </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they had going on in the seventies </v>

4019
02:38:16.571 --> 02:38:17.980
<v Speaker 2>where they were sharing things with </v>
<v Speaker 2>amongst each other.</v>

4020
02:38:18.160 --> 02:38:20.500
<v Speaker 2>You don't need gatekeepers anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are no gatekeepers.</v>

4021
02:38:20.670 --> 02:38:22.960
<v Speaker 2>You can go start a youtube channel now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>find an audience,</v>

4022
02:38:22.961 --> 02:38:23.794
<v Speaker 2>gain thousands subscribers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make a lot of money and say what you </v>

4023
02:38:25.601 --> 02:38:26.434
<v Speaker 2>want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4024
02:38:26.630 --> 02:38:27.463
<v Speaker 2>and that's scary to the traditional </v>
<v Speaker 2>gatekeepers and they don't like it and </v>

4025
02:38:30.941 --> 02:38:31.774
<v Speaker 2>they're there for the fight against that</v>
<v Speaker 2>is so transparent and it's so self </v>

4026
02:38:34.381 --> 02:38:37.840
<v Speaker 2>serving when I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need a media that we can trust,</v>

4027
02:38:38.200 --> 02:38:41.620
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think we need the media as </v>
<v Speaker 2>it is right now either because the media</v>

4028
02:38:41.621 --> 02:38:44.580
<v Speaker 2>we have right now is bloated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dishonest Po,</v>

4029
02:38:44.640 --> 02:38:47.200
<v Speaker 2>a partisan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>politically motivated.</v>

4030
02:38:47.410 --> 02:38:48.243
<v Speaker 2>All of these things that don't really </v>
<v Speaker 2>serve a purpose to educating and </v>

4031
02:38:50.171 --> 02:38:52.390
<v Speaker 2>informing some of the days of cronkite </v>
<v Speaker 2>are gone.</v>

4032
02:38:52.520 --> 02:38:53.353
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't that sort of set the stage for </v>

4033
02:38:54.441 --> 02:38:56.510
<v Speaker 1>someone to come in and offer a viable </v>
<v Speaker 1>alternative?</v>

4034
02:38:56.810 --> 02:38:59.000
<v Speaker 1>I hope so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There you are calling moriarty.</v>

4035
02:38:59.090 --> 02:38:59.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

4036
02:38:59.900 --> 02:39:02.250
<v Speaker 1>that's the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just in my own way like I don't,</v>

4037
02:39:02.251 --> 02:39:03.084
<v Speaker 1>I don't have these delusions of grandeur</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'm going to make millions of </v>

4038
02:39:05.570 --> 02:39:09.680
<v Speaker 1>dollars and have this huge reach already</v>
<v Speaker 1>at $39,000 a month.</v>

4039
02:39:09.720 --> 02:39:11.640
<v Speaker 1>You better cut the shit with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>humility stuff.</v>

4040
02:39:11.660 --> 02:39:12.920
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what you're doing.</v>

4041
02:39:13.050 --> 02:39:14.720
<v Speaker 1>Know what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You fuck stop.</v>

4042
02:39:15.200 --> 02:39:16.033
<v Speaker 1>I've just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just trying to say that I didn't </v>

4043
02:39:16.791 --> 02:39:17.660
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I left my</v>

4044
02:39:18.020 --> 02:39:19.380
<v Speaker 2>making good money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I own,</v>

4045
02:39:19.400 --> 02:39:20.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a kind of funny I,</v>

4046
02:39:21.050 --> 02:39:21.883
<v Speaker 2>I walked away expecting that I was going</v>
<v Speaker 2>take a pay cut to do what I really </v>

4047
02:39:23.931 --> 02:39:26.770
<v Speaker 2>wanted to do and try to do the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing and uh,</v>

4048
02:39:26.850 --> 02:39:28.430
<v Speaker 2>it's great that people are responding </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way they do.</v>

4049
02:39:28.431 --> 02:39:30.700
<v Speaker 2>I hope they continue to respond this way</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it will allow us to do more,</v>

4050
02:39:30.750 --> 02:39:32.130
<v Speaker 3>more of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My advice to you,</v>

4051
02:39:32.131 --> 02:39:32.964
<v Speaker 3>stop being concerned with that and just </v>
<v Speaker 3>do the best of stopped being concerned </v>

4052
02:39:35.251 --> 02:39:37.830
<v Speaker 3>with being humble about all this and it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's definitely gonna drop.</v>

4053
02:39:37.831 --> 02:39:39.190
<v Speaker 3>It's definitely I'm going to make.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>

4054
02:39:39.200 --> 02:39:40.110
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to be payments.</v>

4055
02:39:40.111 --> 02:39:42.180

<v Speaker 3>Forget about all that nonsense.</v>
