1
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.510
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2
00:00:03.511 --> 00:00:07.110
<v Speaker 1>So if we replaced a sacred for respect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we'd be.</v>

3
00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.190
<v Speaker 1>But it's just noises.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the things I like about</v>

4
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.120
<v Speaker 1>labels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I liked intent and intent.</v>

5
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.580
<v Speaker 1>Like my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my idea of sacred is not like God,</v>

6
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.460
<v Speaker 1>like it's not like some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a deity,</v>

7
00:00:20.461 --> 00:00:24.660
<v Speaker 1>this unnamed unknown word that's been</v>
<v Speaker 1>passed down from person to person.</v>

8
00:00:24.661 --> 00:00:27.090
<v Speaker 1>It's based on personal experience based</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a real thing.</v>

9
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.290
<v Speaker 1>So when I say sacred,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like my love,</v>

10
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.400
<v Speaker 1>my love for my children is sacred,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

11
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.700
<v Speaker 1>like I say it in that window.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't say it like in terms of like</v>

12
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.130
<v Speaker 1>hearts and the clouds and all that kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of jazz.</v>

13
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.180
<v Speaker 1>And when we were talking about like</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't be an asshole to people you care</v>

14
00:00:42.181 --> 00:00:45.360
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like doesn't mean it certainly doesn't</v>

15
00:00:45.361 --> 00:00:48.690
<v Speaker 1>mean I'm some sort of a perfect person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certain doesn't mean that I have been an</v>

16
00:00:48.691 --> 00:00:49.410
<v Speaker 1>asshole.</v>

17
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.570
<v Speaker 1>And then sometimes when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>responding to someone else being</v>

18
00:00:51.571 --> 00:00:53.550
<v Speaker 1>retarded or something about being</v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous,</v>

19
00:00:53.551 --> 00:00:57.570
<v Speaker 1>you can be an asshole because you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have the patience for it anymore because</v>

20
00:00:57.571 --> 00:00:59.230
<v Speaker 1>you don't have the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

21
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.850
<v Speaker 1>at the moment you don't have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>temperament to charity.</v>

22
00:01:02.851 --> 00:01:03.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

23
00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:04.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could be maturity.</v>

24
00:01:04.921 --> 00:01:08.550
<v Speaker 1>It could be you're overwhelmed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of variables.</v>

25
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.830
<v Speaker 1>So like if someone hears this and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

26
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:12.601
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well man,</v>

27
00:01:12.601 --> 00:01:16.020
<v Speaker 1>I've been an asshole lately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'm a bad person.</v>

28
00:01:16.021 --> 00:01:16.470
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

29
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.700
<v Speaker 1>it's just recognizing those moments</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you probably could have handled</v>

30
00:01:20.701 --> 00:01:23.160
<v Speaker 1>something better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then continuing to approve.</v>

31
00:01:23.161 --> 00:01:25.200
<v Speaker 1>And then also this idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

32
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.100
<v Speaker 1>this is a really important one because</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have this idea that somehow I'm</v>

33
00:01:29.101 --> 00:01:31.350
<v Speaker 1>30 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't be doing this anymore.</v>

34
00:01:31.351 --> 00:01:33.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm 50 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should have learned by now.</v>

35
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.700
<v Speaker 1>That's all bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Throw that away,</v>

36
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.170
<v Speaker 1>tossed that shit aside.</v>

37
00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.430
<v Speaker 1>You like these ideas of numbers that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have in their head that by a</v>

38
00:01:41.431 --> 00:01:45.150
<v Speaker 1>certain age you should stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are alive.</v>

39
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.600
<v Speaker 1>And if you are alive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you were thinking all those</v>

40
00:01:48.601 --> 00:01:52.240
<v Speaker 1>numbers that you keep attaching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will you know when Einstein was 30 here,</v>

41
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.910
<v Speaker 1>shut the fuck up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop doing that.</v>

42
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.690
<v Speaker 1>That that is a waste of your time and</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop saying to yourself,</v>

43
00:01:57.691 --> 00:02:02.691
<v Speaker 1>I should be better by now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm such a total non helping thought</v>

44
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.950
<v Speaker 1>what you need to think of his life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're living,</v>

45
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:10.920
<v Speaker 1>you're alive right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you've made a mistake and you're</v>

46
00:02:10.921 --> 00:02:13.710
<v Speaker 1>still continuing to learn and grow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all just data.</v>

47
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.640
<v Speaker 1>But the thing that freaks me out the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most about rockhold is the flexibility</v>

48
00:02:17.641 --> 00:02:21.030
<v Speaker 1>and dexterity of his legs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That takes so long to develop that kind</v>

49
00:02:21.031 --> 00:02:22.230
<v Speaker 1>of whip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

50
00:02:22.231 --> 00:02:23.640
<v Speaker 1>like his kicks aren't just hard.</v>

51
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.610
<v Speaker 1>Like Weidman has strong kicks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their strong,</v>

52
00:02:26.611 --> 00:02:30.180
<v Speaker 1>like he throws him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a stiffness to him that</v>

53
00:02:30.181 --> 00:02:33.630
<v Speaker 1>rockwell doesn't have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rock holds got like a taekwondo thing</v>

54
00:02:33.631 --> 00:02:34.720
<v Speaker 1>going big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

55
00:02:34.721 --> 00:02:38.460
<v Speaker 1>It isn't a sake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was 16 and in,</v>

56
00:02:38.461 --> 00:02:40.440
<v Speaker 1>in San Jose when we were hanging out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

57
00:02:40.441 --> 00:02:42.150
<v Speaker 1>how much do you weigh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sixty eight.</v>

58
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.550
<v Speaker 1>Of course I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took a mounted in your face.</v>

59
00:02:44.551 --> 00:02:47.070
<v Speaker 1>I took him in and I took him in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't kid yourself.</v>

60
00:02:47.071 --> 00:02:52.071
<v Speaker 1>Had My hand on his back couple times and</v>
<v Speaker 1>either Brian came back from hanging out.</v>

61
00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.830
<v Speaker 1>Lewis had got his haircut just like him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went,</v>

62
00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.160
<v Speaker 1>the fuck you doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes around Luke,</v>

63
00:02:58.161 --> 00:02:59.550
<v Speaker 1>so I wanted to get my hair like I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

64
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.400
<v Speaker 1>you're 48</v>

65
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.510
<v Speaker 2>copying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look him in the eye and I went,</v>

66
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.100
<v Speaker 2>got exactly like luke when we go to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bar and I looked at my window and we</v>

67
00:03:06.101 --> 00:03:08.440
<v Speaker 2>caught eyes and I looked at my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I told you,</v>

68
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.820
<v Speaker 2>and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he smiled and he went six,</v>

69
00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.820
<v Speaker 2>three and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course you are,</v>

70
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.510
<v Speaker 2>and I looked at his hair and I go deeper</v>
<v Speaker 2>with your voice where we're at a moment</v>

71
00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:20.430
<v Speaker 2>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had a moment here.</v>

72
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.520
<v Speaker 2>Then I went right to super gods for $12</v>
<v Speaker 2>on my gut and I looked at a picture of</v>

73
00:03:27.701 --> 00:03:32.701
<v Speaker 2>Luke rockhold that you fucking try and</v>
<v Speaker 2>fingers my friend Tarek who trains luke</v>

74
00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:34.121
<v Speaker 2>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

75
00:03:34.121 --> 00:03:36.220
<v Speaker 2>counts here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you'd suck luke steak.</v>

76
00:03:36.221 --> 00:03:39.520
<v Speaker 2>We ask them did you can take.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can take.</v>

77
00:03:39.521 --> 00:03:42.810
<v Speaker 2>I think out of that sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

78
00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.740
<v Speaker 2>I'll do it just as a coop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't tell anybody.</v>

79
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.330
<v Speaker 3>I think by and large people can have the</v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective that you have.</v>

80
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.260
<v Speaker 3>They can say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

81
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.200
<v Speaker 3>looks to me like everybody did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So okay.</v>

82
00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.090
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then they can look to the line and they,</v>

83
00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.760
<v Speaker 3>that's where they really start to not</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it.</v>

84
00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.070
<v Speaker 3>They said this guy lied to us</v>
<v Speaker 3>repeatedly,</v>

85
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.800
<v Speaker 3>but of course you get my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no defense to that.</v>

86
00:04:02.801 --> 00:04:06.230
<v Speaker 3>But if I could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I could share any personal insight.</v>

87
00:04:06.231 --> 00:04:07.001
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once you lie,</v>

88
00:04:07.001 --> 00:04:09.730
<v Speaker 3>once you just keep lying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you keep saying this is,</v>

89
00:04:09.731 --> 00:04:11.210
<v Speaker 3>if I'm going to sit here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

90
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.870
<v Speaker 3>this is 15 years ago and Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a nice guy and you.</v>

91
00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.690
<v Speaker 3>I mean if I was on this podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would allied to your fucking face a</v>

92
00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.070
<v Speaker 3>million times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just so you know,</v>

93
00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.980
<v Speaker 3>I have just show you now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just so you know,</v>

94
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.790
<v Speaker 3>that's not a surprise to you or anybody</v>
<v Speaker 3>else,</v>

95
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.880
<v Speaker 3>but once you're in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not as if I'm going to go,</v>

96
00:04:30.881 --> 00:04:32.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this Guy Joe seems like a really nice</v>

97
00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:33.130
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>

98
00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:34.870
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm going to be real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be honest with him,</v>

99
00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.780
<v Speaker 3>too much money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no way you can't once that.</v>

100
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:38.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was,</v>

101
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.830
<v Speaker 3>I was stuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for lack of a better word in that,</v>

102
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.470
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in that lie or that deception,</v>

103
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.340
<v Speaker 3>but then the way that I took my</v>
<v Speaker 3>competitive nature,</v>

104
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.720
<v Speaker 3>which served me well in training and in</v>
<v Speaker 3>racing and took it into the real world,</v>

105
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.840
<v Speaker 3>took it into a press conference,</v>
<v Speaker 3>took it into a personal relationship,</v>

106
00:04:55.841 --> 00:04:59.710
<v Speaker 3>took it into former teammates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My relationship with that.</v>

107
00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.510
<v Speaker 3>That's the part where people go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

108
00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.450
<v Speaker 3>fuck this guy forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm done.</v>

109
00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.110
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

110
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.190
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

111
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.990
<v Speaker 3>you've got sort of three phases.</v>
<v Speaker 3>None of them are good,</v>

112
00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.570
<v Speaker 3>but as it got further away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

113
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.470
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

114
00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:18.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lack of respect for others is the thing</v>

115
00:05:18.971 --> 00:05:21.400
<v Speaker 3>that totally fucked me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

116
00:05:21.401 --> 00:05:25.270
<v Speaker 3>too that I would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say to anybody that I understand</v>

117
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:26.110
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>

118
00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.000
<v Speaker 3>I may be in their time out forever.</v>

119
00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.280
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have,</v>

120
00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.350
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only thing I will add that,</v>

121
00:05:32.351 --> 00:05:34.570
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that may sound like I'm trying to defend</v>

122
00:05:34.571 --> 00:05:38.110
<v Speaker 3>myself as I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've tried to make amends with all those</v>

123
00:05:38.111 --> 00:05:39.040
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

124
00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.290
<v Speaker 3>The ones that we all know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ones people talk about,</v>

125
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.080
<v Speaker 3>I've traveled the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've sat with them,</v>

126
00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:44.560
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've looked them in the eyes and said</v>

127
00:05:44.561 --> 00:05:47.590
<v Speaker 3>what I did was totally unacceptable that</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>

128
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.070
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and almost everybody has accepted the</v>

129
00:05:51.071 --> 00:05:54.050
<v Speaker 3>apology and we've moved on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

130
00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.130
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't get to this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

131
00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:02.330
<v Speaker 3>this crowd of people that you can't sit</v>
<v Speaker 3>with face to face and you can't say</v>

132
00:06:02.331 --> 00:06:03.550
<v Speaker 3>you're sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

133
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.330
<v Speaker 3>I can talk to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can talk about it.</v>

134
00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:07.420
<v Speaker 3>Some people may view that as an apology</v>
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>

135
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:08.383
<v Speaker 3>or not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

136
00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.480
<v Speaker 3>but the ones that I could go sit with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did.</v>

137
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:13.650
<v Speaker 3>And that's all that I would add to that.</v>

138
00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:14.483
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

139
00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:15.710
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

140
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:18.930
<v Speaker 3>I'm proud that most of those people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I say most,</v>

141
00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.690
<v Speaker 3>not everybody because not everybody's</v>
<v Speaker 3>ready,</v>

142
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:22.760
<v Speaker 3>but most of those people said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

143
00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:24.470
<v Speaker 3>we're good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're done.</v>

144
00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:26.750
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

145
00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:28.490
<v Speaker 3>if there was my son and he acted that</v>
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>

146
00:06:28.491 --> 00:06:30.230
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd say the fuck you doing,</v>

147
00:06:30.231 --> 00:06:32.200
<v Speaker 3>you can't act that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I had no,</v>

148
00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.040
<v Speaker 3>nobody was standing over me going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

149
00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:36.620
<v Speaker 3>what are you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you,</v>

150
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:38.090
<v Speaker 3>you're acting like an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nope,</v>

151
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.050
<v Speaker 3>nobody did that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

152
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:42.320
<v Speaker 3>but if my son did that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say you get over there and you</v>

153
00:06:42.321 --> 00:06:46.040
<v Speaker 3>make it right with that person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's where it is.</v>

154
00:06:46.041 --> 00:06:48.170
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here we go.</v>

155
00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:50.150
<v Speaker 4>Well there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

156
00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.380
<v Speaker 4>what I can only describe as like a gun</v>
<v Speaker 4>bodega,</v>

157
00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:55.770
<v Speaker 4>which is fascinating because it's sold</v>
<v Speaker 4>all these different guns.</v>

158
00:06:55.771 --> 00:06:58.350
<v Speaker 4>Like it might sound like a beautiful</v>
<v Speaker 4>antique,</v>

159
00:06:58.351 --> 00:07:00.500
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pearl Inlaid revolver that like</v>

160
00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:02.670
<v Speaker 4>someone's dad had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then also grenades and stuff and</v>

161
00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.620
<v Speaker 4>grenades.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Grenades.</v>

162
00:07:04.621 --> 00:07:05.460
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because,</v>

163
00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.220
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in case someone tried to kidnap you,</v>

164
00:07:07.221 --> 00:07:10.140
<v Speaker 4>you could have it grab a fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're coming with me bitch.</v>

165
00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:11.700
<v Speaker 4>Basically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Basically.</v>

166
00:07:11.701 --> 00:07:14.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we're walking through this town and</v>

167
00:07:14.611 --> 00:07:16.320
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was,</v>

168
00:07:16.321 --> 00:07:19.230
<v Speaker 4>I think the scariest thing that I ever</v>
<v Speaker 4>did in my life.</v>

169
00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:22.800
<v Speaker 4>But it all turned out fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we got to the media office,</v>

170
00:07:22.801 --> 00:07:26.070
<v Speaker 4>which it was a government building that</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

171
00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:28.680
<v Speaker 4>that these young men have taken over</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they kicked out the central</v>

172
00:07:28.681 --> 00:07:32.760
<v Speaker 4>government and I'm the director of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>had been kidnapped by Isis and the young</v>

173
00:07:32.761 --> 00:07:34.020
<v Speaker 4>guys are there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like watching,</v>

174
00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:37.050
<v Speaker 4>watching soccer because everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone loves soccer there.</v>

175
00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:42.000
<v Speaker 4>And it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

176
00:07:42.001 --> 00:07:46.410
<v Speaker 4>it's like</v>
<v Speaker 4>this feeling of being in this place</v>

177
00:07:46.411 --> 00:07:51.411
<v Speaker 4>where I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the whole world is both fucking with it</v>

178
00:07:51.691 --> 00:07:53.520
<v Speaker 4>and abandoned it both at once,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

179
00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:57.150
<v Speaker 4>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and anything could happen.</v>

180
00:07:57.151 --> 00:07:58.650
<v Speaker 4>So that was the most dangerous thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've ever done.</v>

181
00:07:58.651 --> 00:08:01.380
<v Speaker 4>Like nothing I've ever done was as</v>
<v Speaker 4>dangerous is going to Syria.</v>

182
00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:05.160
<v Speaker 4>But I think the most app personally</v>
<v Speaker 4>disturbing thing was um,</v>

183
00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:10.340
<v Speaker 4>I was in Gaza six months ago I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I went to [inaudible],</v>

184
00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:14.730
<v Speaker 4>which is this neighborhood that was</v>
<v Speaker 4>completely destroyed by Israel during</v>

185
00:08:14.731 --> 00:08:16.830
<v Speaker 4>protective edge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they bombed it and then they went</v>

186
00:08:16.831 --> 00:08:18.750
<v Speaker 4>in with tanks and then they went in with</v>
<v Speaker 4>bulldozers.</v>

187
00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:22.020
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's like flattened and it's just</v>

188
00:08:22.021 --> 00:08:23.400
<v Speaker 4>like gone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

189
00:08:23.401 --> 00:08:24.040
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

190
00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.470
<v Speaker 4>you go there and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>

191
00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:29.460
<v Speaker 4>this is a neighborhood that has been</v>
<v Speaker 4>wrecked and a lot of times when you see</v>

192
00:08:29.461 --> 00:08:33.510
<v Speaker 4>houses that have collapsed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can see all of the stuff of people's</v>

193
00:08:33.511 --> 00:08:34.530
<v Speaker 4>lives and it like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

194
00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:37.530
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's the cooking pots and there's the</v>

195
00:08:37.531 --> 00:08:40.020
<v Speaker 4>bed and there's all the stuff that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>just trapped in.</v>

196
00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:43.620
<v Speaker 4>And then people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because there's a big housing shortage,</v>

197
00:08:43.621 --> 00:08:48.000
<v Speaker 4>obviously in Gaza were living in these</v>
<v Speaker 4>bombed out buildings,</v>

198
00:08:48.001 --> 00:08:49.350
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where their home was.</v>

199
00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.220
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

200
00:08:53.221 --> 00:08:56.010
<v Speaker 4>with no real like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or anything.</v>

201
00:08:56.011 --> 00:08:58.470
<v Speaker 4>Like I saw this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was walking,</v>

202
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.260
<v Speaker 4>it was kind of scrambling through this</v>
<v Speaker 4>building,</v>

203
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:03.000
<v Speaker 4>take pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I just randomly walked into</v>

204
00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.870
<v Speaker 4>what I thought was an abandoned room and</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's like an old guy there,</v>

205
00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:06.631
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hanging out.</v>

206
00:09:06.631 --> 00:09:09.140
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm really sorry to invade,</v>

207
00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:12.420
<v Speaker 4>invade your home.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was just talking to him.</v>

208
00:09:12.421 --> 00:09:14.520
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he had had like a baller,</v>

209
00:09:14.521 --> 00:09:15.590
<v Speaker 4>gorgeous home,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

210
00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:18.030
<v Speaker 4>before this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And now he was just living in a little,</v>

211
00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:20.520
<v Speaker 4>like the wreck of one of the rooms.</v>
