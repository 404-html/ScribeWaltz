1
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.470
<v Speaker 1>Freak bitches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

2
00:00:03.471 --> 00:00:05.700
<v Speaker 1>Whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody who has thinks they have the</v>

3
00:00:05.701 --> 00:00:08.880
<v Speaker 1>truth with a capital t,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is called a fundamentalist.</v>

4
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:10.880
<v Speaker 1>We're all fundamentalists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5
00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.920
<v Speaker 1>we all have aspects of our personalities</v>
<v Speaker 1>and our belief systems that are</v>

6
00:00:13.921 --> 00:00:15.660
<v Speaker 1>fundamentalist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you asked me about sugar,</v>

7
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.020
<v Speaker 1>I'll wax poetic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you all about the evils of</v>

8
00:00:19.021 --> 00:00:21.150
<v Speaker 1>sugar and I really believe I'm right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

9
00:00:21.151 --> 00:00:23.220
<v Speaker 1>I have a lot of data and science behind</v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

10
00:00:23.221 --> 00:00:24.870
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

11
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have all kinds of ideas about why</v>

12
00:00:27.271 --> 00:00:30.220
<v Speaker 1>sugar is bad and fat and proteins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good for you because you know,</v>

13
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.060
<v Speaker 1>I've lived in and I've done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you have your own point of</v>

14
00:00:33.061 --> 00:00:34.680
<v Speaker 1>view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich</v>

15
00:00:34.681 --> 00:00:37.920
<v Speaker 1>today and it was damn good and it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>damn good and you didn't hurt anybody</v>

16
00:00:37.921 --> 00:00:39.570
<v Speaker 1>including you probably didn't hurt</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

17
00:00:39.571 --> 00:00:42.690
<v Speaker 1>So sometimes because you're not a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentalist because every now and</v>

18
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:43.110
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

71
00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.620
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird way to have your brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>wired.</v>

72
00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.770
<v Speaker 1>It was such an interesting kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>insight when I was there and it'd be</v>

73
00:02:44.771 --> 00:02:45.191
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for real.</v>

78
00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.540
<v Speaker 1>So many people have been caught with</v>
<v Speaker 1>those wizard Nader's.</v>

79
00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.080
<v Speaker 1>Now what you do is you put bleach under</v>
<v Speaker 1>your finger now or the special.</v>

80
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.110
<v Speaker 1>That's like no advanced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what Joey Diaz says.</v>

81
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said he put it.</v>

82
00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.020
<v Speaker 1>He put clorox under the skin of his</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dick.</v>

83
00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:12.550
<v Speaker 1>He was talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I one time said he put Draino there too</v>

84
00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:13.403
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>

85
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.250
<v Speaker 1>I used to put coffee on my balls when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>went to court,</v>

86
00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.740
<v Speaker 1>the coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put it in a plastic bag in a rubber</v>

87
00:03:20.741 --> 00:03:24.040
<v Speaker 1>band and wrap it around my school and go</v>
<v Speaker 1>to court.</v>

88
00:03:24.041 --> 00:03:26.530
<v Speaker 1>But he looked like a pimp because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to court every month.</v>

89
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.470
<v Speaker 1>Urine like 50 people in a jail cell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

90
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.040
<v Speaker 1>And you're just right there and nothing</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>

91
00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.440
<v Speaker 1>I want some coffee on me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that.</v>

92
00:03:38.131 --> 00:03:42.340
<v Speaker 1>And then everyone was shooting it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like when you're in there,</v>

93
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.620
<v Speaker 1>you want it to be just like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey man,</v>

94

97
00:03:53.171 --> 00:03:54.950

<v Speaker 1>in prison?</v>

98
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.800
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is when I</v>

99
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.210
<v Speaker 1>know that I'm already in prison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you've got to go to court.</v>

100
00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.340
<v Speaker 1>So I was going to court to get my</v>
<v Speaker 1>license back because you have the right</v>

101
00:04:09.341 --> 00:04:11.830
<v Speaker 1>to get your license back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though you're in prison,</v>

102
00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.210
<v Speaker 1>you still have the right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're like,</v>
