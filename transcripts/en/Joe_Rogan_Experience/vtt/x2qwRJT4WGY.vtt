<v Speaker 1>Four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

2
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.790
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

3
00:00:06.791 --> 00:00:10.330
<v Speaker 1>ladies and Gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael Shermer and heavens on earth.</v>

4
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.950
<v Speaker 1>The scientific search for the afterlife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>immortality and Utopia.</v>

5
00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.170
<v Speaker 1>Did you find anything?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

6
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.120
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>

7
00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.240
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found interesting journeys that people</v>

8
00:00:22.241 --> 00:00:25.810
<v Speaker 1>use to try to get there from both the </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious perspective and the scientific</v>

9
00:00:25.811 --> 00:00:27.430
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

10
00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.390
<v Speaker 1>so I do deal with the monotheisms </v>
<v Speaker 1>versions of the afterlife and heaven,</v>

11
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Judaism,</v>

12
00:00:32.381 --> 00:00:33.214
<v Speaker 1>Christianity and Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the core of the book is the radical </v>

13
00:00:35.621 --> 00:00:38.460
<v Speaker 1>life extension is crayons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>transhumanist,</v>

14
00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.380
<v Speaker 1>the Extropians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mind up loaders,</v>

15
00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.160
<v Speaker 1>the people that take all the supplements</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of the whole range there.</v>

16
00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.430
<v Speaker 1>I find that incredibly interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They call it an afterlife or atheists.</v>

17
00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.140
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

18
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean when,</v>

19
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.200
<v Speaker 1>when you think about some of the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are really like over the top hope,</v>

20
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.850
<v Speaker 1>did you go to that 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>45 thing in New York a few years back?</v>

21
00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.133
<v Speaker 1>There was a futurist convention with all</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people that for whatever reason </v>

22
00:01:02.111 --> 00:01:05.060
<v Speaker 1>they have this arbitrary date of 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>45 years.</v>

23
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.600
<v Speaker 1>It's been getting pushed back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is when the singularity come,</v>

24
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.390
<v Speaker 1>he's going to cut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was 20 slash 30,</v>

25
00:01:10.391 --> 00:01:12.070
<v Speaker 1>then 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 now 45.</v>

26
00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.490
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kurzweil Kurzweil big.</v>

27
00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.220
<v Speaker 1>He's like the Grand Poobah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is no download it.</v>

28
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:21.363
<v Speaker 1>And when he gets on stage now he's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>Predator naturally dynamic like a </v>

29
00:01:24.311 --> 00:01:26.770
<v Speaker 1>preacher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he starts talking about,</v>

30
00:01:26.771 --> 00:01:28.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna get to live forever.</v>

31
00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:31.060
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have your mind uploaded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people are just like,</v>

32
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.090
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are the generation that's going to do</v>

33
00:01:34.091 --> 00:01:35.410
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the first time.</v>

34
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:36.221
<v Speaker 1>And the mom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

35
00:01:36.221 --> 00:01:38.320
<v Speaker 1>I used to be religious in my youth and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>

36
00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.630
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is like being back in church again.</v>

37
00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.090
<v Speaker 1>She stopped being religious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

38
00:01:43.091 --> 00:01:45.580
<v Speaker 1>I started in high school and stopped in </v>
<v Speaker 1>graduate school,</v>

39
00:01:45.581 --> 00:01:46.630
<v Speaker 1>so it was much seven.</v>

40
00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.010
<v Speaker 1>You started being religious in high </v>
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>

41
00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.030
<v Speaker 1>so it wasn't something that your family </v>
<v Speaker 1>introduced.</v>

42
00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.360
<v Speaker 1>My parents were pretty secular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

43
00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.950
<v Speaker 1>they weren't antireligious at what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't a thing then,</v>

44
00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.190
<v Speaker 1>but this is 1971 when I was in high </v>
<v Speaker 1>school and the,</v>

45
00:02:00.191 --> 00:02:01.024
<v Speaker 1>and the sort of nascent born again </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement was starting and there was no </v>

46
00:02:03.881 --> 00:02:05.440
<v Speaker 1>religious affiliation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just like,</v>

47
00:02:05.441 --> 00:02:06.940
<v Speaker 1>it's me and Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

48
00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.300
<v Speaker 1>It's just you and the Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of these,</v>

49
00:02:10.301 --> 00:02:12.430
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very charismatic hip,</v>

50
00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:13.323
<v Speaker 1>young preachers that are doing sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing like that where they don't even </v>

51
00:02:16.691 --> 00:02:17.524
<v Speaker 1>have their own church to like rent time </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the church and they have these </v>

52
00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.993
<v Speaker 1>meetings where it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just nondenominational and they </v>

53
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.680
<v Speaker 1>just talk about God and yet they get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of people fired up.</v>

54
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.000
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

55
00:02:31.001 --> 00:02:31.370
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

56
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.320
<v Speaker 1>the place I went to this place called </v>
<v Speaker 1>the barn in Locker Santa where I grew up</v>

57
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.220
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

58
00:02:36.221 --> 00:02:40.000
<v Speaker 1>they played guitar and sang to a sex </v>
<v Speaker 1>cult.</v>

59
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.020
<v Speaker 1>It was kind of only starts banging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was hoping for something like that.</v>

60
00:02:44.021 --> 00:02:44.854
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

61
00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.093
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

62
00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.093
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is one of the problems with the </v>

63
00:02:47.861 --> 00:02:50.740
<v Speaker 1>utopia that 19th century utopian </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiments,</v>

64
00:02:50.741 --> 00:02:52.120
<v Speaker 1>they always turned into this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

65
00:02:52.121 --> 00:02:53.840
<v Speaker 1>free sex for the leader.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

66
00:02:53.841 --> 00:02:54.674
<v Speaker 1>it always seems like whenever there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>man that's in a position where people </v>

67
00:02:57.971 --> 00:02:59.890
<v Speaker 1>start worshiping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

68
00:02:59.891 --> 00:03:02.350
<v Speaker 1>and then they start hanging on his every</v>
<v Speaker 1>word.</v>

69
00:03:02.351 --> 00:03:03.330
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>start you gotta.</v>

70
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.920
<v Speaker 1>Start fucking some of these people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

71
00:03:05.921 --> 00:03:08.280
<v Speaker 1>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I covered Jim Jones and uh,</v>

72
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way I phrase it is that no one joins</v>

73
00:03:10.961 --> 00:03:11.794
<v Speaker 1>a cult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They join a group that they think is </v>

74
00:03:13.481 --> 00:03:14.314
<v Speaker 1>going to do good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>save the world can help me improve my </v>

75
00:03:16.121 --> 00:03:17.710
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>improve the lives of others.</v>

76
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.933
<v Speaker 1>And there's pictures online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see if Jim Jones with Jerry </v>

77
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.270
<v Speaker 1>Brown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>governor Jerry Brown first round and you</v>

78
00:03:23.271 --> 00:03:24.730
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were man in the soup kitchens.</v>

79
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:25.563
<v Speaker 1>He was very liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>open to African Americans being part of </v>

80
00:03:27.761 --> 00:03:29.950
<v Speaker 1>the church in San Francisco.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're gays women.</v>

81
00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.001
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

82
00:03:31.001 --> 00:03:31.834
<v Speaker 1>it was a really cutting edge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pioneering thing at the time it seemed </v>

83
00:03:34.181 --> 00:03:34.481
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

84
00:03:34.481 --> 00:03:35.530
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a cool thing.</v>

85
00:03:35.531 --> 00:03:37.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to join this group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that me,</v>

86
00:03:37.451 --> 00:03:38.284
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people that did this in the fifties </v>

87
00:03:40.181 --> 00:03:43.060
<v Speaker 1>and sixties when he was coming up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then into the seventies and then,</v>

88
00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:44.200
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

89
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.810
<v Speaker 1>he started having sex and drugs and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

90
00:03:46.811 --> 00:03:47.644
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the feds started kind of poking around </v>

91
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.780
<v Speaker 1>taxes and that's when they went to South</v>
<v Speaker 1>America speaking,</v>

92
00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.610
<v Speaker 1>which I think this week is the spike </v>
<v Speaker 1>special.</v>

93
00:03:54.611 --> 00:03:57.140
<v Speaker 1>It's now the paramount network on Waco.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Waco,</v>

94
00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.960
<v Speaker 1>this isn't that right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like a started Sunday.</v>

95
00:04:01.961 --> 00:04:02.561
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

96
00:04:02.561 --> 00:04:06.220
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a six part series or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something along those lines.</v>

97
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.250
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an interesting.</v>

98
00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:08.290
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

99
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm absolutely convinced most of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys believe what they say now.</v>

100
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:12.663
<v Speaker 1>Maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they're bullshitters at the start </v>

101
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:16.040
<v Speaker 1>or they only partially believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they,</v>

102
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.983
<v Speaker 1>they repeat the rhetoric.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their followers give them positive </v>

103
00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:20.230
<v Speaker 1>reinforcement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They come to believe it.</v>

104
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:21.370
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

105
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.950
<v Speaker 1>David Koresh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was right down the barrel.</v>

106
00:04:23.951 --> 00:04:24.784
<v Speaker 1>He totally believed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to die for his beliefs and he </v>

107
00:04:27.851 --> 00:04:29.260
<v Speaker 1>also was having sex with everybody.</v>

108
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so common.</v>

109
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:34.323
<v Speaker 1>It's almost cliche.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And his ex girlfriend grew up in one of </v>

110
00:04:36.821 --> 00:04:39.400
<v Speaker 1>these sort of religious cults and it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same deal.</v>

111
00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.360
<v Speaker 1>The head guy was having sex with all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>women and you know,</v>

112
00:04:43.361 --> 00:04:44.194
<v Speaker 1>he would have sex with different </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's wives and everybody had a lead </v>

113
00:04:46.391 --> 00:04:47.390
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

00:04:54.821 --> 00:04:56.920
<v Speaker 1>Jeff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve Jeffries.</v>

120
00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.930
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking of Jim Jefferies,</v>

121
00:04:58.931 --> 00:04:59.830
<v Speaker 1>my friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the comedian.</v>

122
00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:02.261
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

123
00:05:02.261 --> 00:05:02.801
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

124
00:05:02.801 --> 00:05:05.420
<v Speaker 1>that's how it gets corrupted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you've ever read John.</v>

125
00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm John Crack hours book under the </v>
<v Speaker 1>banner of Heaven.</v>

126
00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:09.123
<v Speaker 1>This is the guy that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that mountain climber that did a into </v>

127
00:05:10.751 --> 00:05:12.130
<v Speaker 1>thin air and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

128
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.610
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

129
00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.880
<v Speaker 1>the one about the Alaskan kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

130
00:05:15.881 --> 00:05:18.550
<v Speaker 1>he wrote this book called under the </v>
<v Speaker 1>banner of the kid who died.</v>

131
00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:19.463
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they made that movie about moving </v>

132
00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.930
<v Speaker 1>into the wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

133
00:05:22.931 --> 00:05:26.050
<v Speaker 1>So he did into the wild into thin air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Krakauer's a great writer.</v>

134
00:05:26.051 --> 00:05:26.884
<v Speaker 1>So this book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he starts to investigate the murder of </v>

135
00:05:29.111 --> 00:05:30.400
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

136
00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.310
<v Speaker 1>polygamous family in Utah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just as a journalist.</v>

137
00:05:33.311 --> 00:05:35.380
<v Speaker 1>He's going to do a story for the New </v>
<v Speaker 1>Yorker or something.</v>

138
00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.513
<v Speaker 1>And then he realized it just takes them </v>
<v Speaker 1>down the path of this incredible world </v>

139
00:05:38.981 --> 00:05:42.100
<v Speaker 1>of polygamy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which still goes on now legally it's not</v>

140
00:05:42.101 --> 00:05:42.934
<v Speaker 1>illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they marry one and then the others </v>

141
00:05:44.321 --> 00:05:48.070
<v Speaker 1>are so called sister wives and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>just there and they live on these,</v>

142
00:05:48.071 --> 00:05:51.430
<v Speaker 1>in these border towns along the border </v>
<v Speaker 1>between Colorado and Utah,</v>

143
00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:52.950
<v Speaker 1>like Colorado city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

144
00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:54.850
<v Speaker 1>I've been to some of these places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a,</v>

145
00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.820
<v Speaker 1>it's like a twilight zone episode.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go into this town gas station,</v>

146
00:05:58.821 --> 00:05:59.361
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

147
00:05:59.361 --> 00:06:00.980
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it feels kind of weird here.</v>

148
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:02.263
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so krakauer discovered this whole world </v>

149
00:06:04.101 --> 00:06:04.520
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

150
00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.180
<v Speaker 1>going all the way back to the founding </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the religion.</v>

151
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.760
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

152
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:12.790
<v Speaker 1>what's the name Joseph Smith and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

153
00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:15.130
<v Speaker 1>he gets this revelation from God that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

154
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.900
<v Speaker 1>well basically he's banging the woman </v>
<v Speaker 1>down the street,</v>

155
00:06:17.901 --> 00:06:18.734
<v Speaker 1>he's married.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he gets this revelation from God </v>

156
00:06:20.841 --> 00:06:23.780
<v Speaker 1>and crack era has this scenario in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>book where he,</v>

157
00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.550
<v Speaker 1>he tells his wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

158
00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:26.384
<v Speaker 1>honey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been talking to God and you're not </v>

159
00:06:27.441 --> 00:06:29.300
<v Speaker 1>going to believe this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he says,</v>

160
00:06:29.301 --> 00:06:30.680
<v Speaker 1>I have to marry this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

161
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:31.770
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so down the street.</v>

162
00:06:31.771 --> 00:06:32.900
<v Speaker 1>And she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

163
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.810
<v Speaker 1>well I have to start seeing other guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

164
00:06:36.811 --> 00:06:37.644
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God was very specific about this just </v>

165
00:06:39.711 --> 00:06:41.510
<v Speaker 1>for the guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

166
00:06:41.511 --> 00:06:43.820
<v Speaker 1>and how do I know you talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

167
00:06:43.821 --> 00:06:44.840
<v Speaker 1>my buddies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were there.</v>

168
00:06:44.841 --> 00:06:45.674
<v Speaker 1>They heard it also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is the first page of the book </v>

169
00:06:48.201 --> 00:06:49.430
<v Speaker 1>of Mormon is an affidavit.</v>

170
00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:50.293
<v Speaker 1>These are the people that heard the </v>
<v Speaker 1>revelation that they all signed it and </v>

171
00:06:53.661 --> 00:06:54.321
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

172
00:06:54.321 --> 00:06:55.154
<v Speaker 1>so this is how it starts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When Joseph Smith started it all off in </v>

173
00:06:57.261 --> 00:06:57.900
<v Speaker 1>18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>

174
00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:59.690
<v Speaker 1>he was only 14.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

175
00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:04.430
<v Speaker 1>so 14 year old is not a liar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just learned that a lie.</v>

176
00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.500
<v Speaker 1>It's not even like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're bad people.</v>

177
00:07:06.501 --> 00:07:09.350
<v Speaker 1>When you're 14 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are a developing entity.</v>

178
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:12.260
<v Speaker 1>You know your frontal lobes are not </v>
<v Speaker 1>fully formed.</v>

179
00:07:12.261 --> 00:07:14.780
<v Speaker 1>You don't really know what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>practicing sentences,</v>

180
00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.530
<v Speaker 1>you know what you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to exert your influence,</v>

181
00:07:18.531 --> 00:07:23.531
<v Speaker 1>and this guy was just very creative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was and he got chased out of Palmyra.</v>

182
00:07:23.781 --> 00:07:24.614
<v Speaker 1>New York is where he started and then he</v>
<v Speaker 1>moved to Missouri when basically he was </v>

183
00:07:27.231 --> 00:07:28.064
<v Speaker 1>in trouble with the law and and other </v>
<v Speaker 1>issues and then he got in trouble there </v>

184
00:07:31.551 --> 00:07:35.870
<v Speaker 1>and he was killed and it usually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this ends a cult when the leader dies.</v>

185
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:37.590
<v Speaker 1>Now there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

186
00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:40.970
<v Speaker 1>there's a critical period if you get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>new dynamic leader to take over.</v>

187
00:07:40.971 --> 00:07:41.804
<v Speaker 1>Like in the case of scientology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>David miscavige took over after l Ron </v>

188
00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:48.730
<v Speaker 1>Hubbard passed over to the other side </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he managed to keep it going.</v>

189
00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:49.593
<v Speaker 1>Same thing with Brigham Young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was bringing young that turned this </v>

190
00:07:51.801 --> 00:07:52.634
<v Speaker 1>little cult into a a world religion and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they just went further west to Utah to </v>

191
00:07:56.031 --> 00:07:58.490
<v Speaker 1>get away from federal authorities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

192
00:07:58.491 --> 00:08:01.760
<v Speaker 1>how much of a hit is scientology taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>from that?</v>

193
00:08:01.761 --> 00:08:04.150
<v Speaker 1>Leah Remini?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

194
00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:07.970
<v Speaker 1>I've not seen any data like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>memberships and they're all secret about</v>

195
00:08:07.971 --> 00:08:08.391
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>

196
00:08:08.391 --> 00:08:10.220
<v Speaker 1>It's proprietary data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so who knows?</v>

197
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:13.310
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine they could survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

198
00:08:13.311 --> 00:08:14.144
<v Speaker 1>they could survive because they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>tons of money through real estate </v>

199
00:08:15.951 --> 00:08:16.784
<v Speaker 1>investments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can't imagine their numbers or </v>

200
00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:20.440
<v Speaker 1>could be doing anything but drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

201
00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:24.820
<v Speaker 1>Between the Lawrence Wright book than </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Hbo Documentary Feature.</v>

202
00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:30.340
<v Speaker 1>The crispy and your dialogue with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Aaliyah was incredible and cheese.</v>

203
00:08:30.741 --> 00:08:34.310
<v Speaker 1>Just to hero amongst secular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that fight against colts?</v>

204
00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:37.190
<v Speaker 1>That's really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really the best way to do it.</v>

205
00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:40.730
<v Speaker 1>Not top down laws against cults unless </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing something,</v>

206
00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:43.930
<v Speaker 1>he'll obviously illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just bottom up members speaking.</v>

207
00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:48.320
<v Speaker 1>I had David Miscavige has dad on as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

208
00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:50.420
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was sad.</v>

209
00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:54.560
<v Speaker 1>That was sad because I felt like I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to a guy who felt like he wasted</v>

210
00:08:54.561 --> 00:08:56.100
<v Speaker 1>his life and lost</v>

211
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:57.020
<v Speaker 2>his son.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

212
00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:00.870
<v Speaker 2>And he brought his son into scientology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing was.</v>

213
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.050
<v Speaker 2>That was really disturbing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

214
00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:04.553
<v Speaker 2>Just A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just very strange that the United </v>

215
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:10.650
<v Speaker 2>States government is allowing those </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to be tax exempt.</v>

216
00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with all the evidence that's available,</v>

217
00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:13.883
<v Speaker 2>you just go and look at what they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>proposing and what they believe and the </v>

218
00:09:18.301 --> 00:09:22.490
<v Speaker 2>fetus and the frozens entities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're dropped into the volcano.</v>

219
00:09:22.491 --> 00:09:24.340
<v Speaker 2>All the crazy shell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The story about there,</v>

220
00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.300
<v Speaker 2>this is what really worried me about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>irs.</v>

221
00:09:27.301 --> 00:09:28.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always thought,</v>

222
00:09:28.471 --> 00:09:30.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't fear it hell or the devil,</v>

223
00:09:30.901 --> 00:09:32.230
<v Speaker 2>but I figured the irs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

224
00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:33.750
<v Speaker 2>I take.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty careful about that,</v>

225
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:34.823
<v Speaker 2>but they're the only major organization </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've ever seen that beat the irs and </v>

226
00:09:37.531 --> 00:09:40.170
<v Speaker 2>they did it through a thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 2>lawsuits.</v>

227
00:09:40.171 --> 00:09:41.004
<v Speaker 2>I think they sued him like 3,500 times </v>
<v Speaker 2>or something and every single member </v>

228
00:09:44.821 --> 00:09:47.550
<v Speaker 2>that they could get to do it to them as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

229
00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:49.580
<v Speaker 2>They were getting all their members to </v>
<v Speaker 2>suicide.</v>

230
00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:51.300
<v Speaker 2>They were suing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the story.</v>

231
00:09:51.301 --> 00:09:52.830
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that how it worked?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

232
00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:55.290
<v Speaker 2>And eventually the irs has said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

233
00:09:55.291 --> 00:09:57.530
<v Speaker 2>if I get your tea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your tech.</v>

234
00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:58.473
<v Speaker 2>But I mean if they're letting the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mormons do it and why wouldn't they let </v>

235
00:10:02.401 --> 00:10:05.160
<v Speaker 2>the scientists do and I really don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>think any religion.</v>

236
00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:07.140
<v Speaker 2>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

237
00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:10.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean in 2018 with what we know about </v>
<v Speaker 2>reality,</v>

238
00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:14.370
<v Speaker 2>the fact that we let some old voodoo </v>
<v Speaker 2>superstitious nonsense,</v>

239
00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:15.423
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not have to pay taxes and exert extreme </v>

240
00:10:17.551 --> 00:10:19.710
<v Speaker 2>power politically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>socially,</v>

241
00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:21.810
<v Speaker 2>economically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

242
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:22.831
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

243
00:10:22.831 --> 00:10:24.420
<v Speaker 2>And they like preachers get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They could,</v>

244
00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:25.293
<v Speaker 2>they can live in a house tax free,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then have to pay property tax on the </v>

245
00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:28.810
<v Speaker 2>home that they own,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

246
00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:32.120
<v Speaker 2>So there's a lot of these side benefits </v>
<v Speaker 2>also that you don't normally hear about.</v>

247
00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:32.963
<v Speaker 2>So gross.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the freedom from religion foundation </v>

248
00:10:35.101 --> 00:10:38.580
<v Speaker 2>and some of these other organizations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Acu trying to combat some of this,</v>

249
00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:40.770
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but legally,</v>

250
00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:41.633
<v Speaker 2>how do you distinguish that from say a </v>
<v Speaker 2>nonprofit like doctors without borders </v>

251
00:10:44.581 --> 00:10:46.650
<v Speaker 2>or one of these other groups?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That Clinton Foundation?</v>

252
00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:50.193
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was some statistic recently and </v>

253
00:10:52.441 --> 00:10:55.410
<v Speaker 2>the Clinton Foundation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much money and not in 2014.</v>

254
00:10:55.411 --> 00:10:58.410
<v Speaker 2>They actually donated to Cherry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Christ.</v>

255
00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:01.950
<v Speaker 2>It was like six percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something like extremely low.</v>

256
00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:03.780
<v Speaker 2>The rest of it with payroll and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

257
00:11:03.781 --> 00:11:05.340
<v Speaker 2>mostly expenses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Private.</v>

258
00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:08.670
<v Speaker 2>They're scams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All these things are scams.</v>

259
00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:09.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

260
00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:11.093
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might be good to just clean house </v>

261
00:11:11.851 --> 00:11:12.684
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just.</v>

262
00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:16.110
<v Speaker 2>No one gets a nonprofit or tax free </v>
<v Speaker 2>status.</v>

263
00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:17.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless you're just.</v>

264
00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:18.560
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

265
00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:19.413
<v Speaker 2>I mean I feel like there was room in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world for compassionate charities that </v>

266
00:11:22.741 --> 00:11:25.740
<v Speaker 2>are actual charities that are really </v>
<v Speaker 2>legitimate.</v>

267
00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:26.693
<v Speaker 2>There's room in the world for them and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think that they should have tax exempt </v>

268
00:11:29.341 --> 00:11:30.174
<v Speaker 2>status,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think we should be really </v>

269
00:11:30.541 --> 00:11:31.680
<v Speaker 2>stringent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

270
00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:34.500
<v Speaker 2>You know about what we accept.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

271
00:11:34.501 --> 00:11:35.334
<v Speaker 2>Well the Supreme Court then they have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>pr problem is where do you draw the </v>

272
00:11:37.501 --> 00:11:39.450
<v Speaker 2>line?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know?</v>

273
00:11:39.451 --> 00:11:40.320
<v Speaker 2>Because somebody says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

274
00:11:40.321 --> 00:11:43.740
<v Speaker 2>I have a goofy belief that the Jane's </v>
<v Speaker 2>have some weird beliefs or something,</v>

275
00:11:43.741 --> 00:11:44.570
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

276
00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:45.403
<v Speaker 2>but they're man in the soup kitchens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're helping the poor and there's no </v>

277
00:11:47.161 --> 00:11:47.994
<v Speaker 2>corruption.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what's the difference between them </v>

278
00:11:50.101 --> 00:11:51.300
<v Speaker 2>and the scientologists who say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

279
00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:52.433
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have our own religious beliefs that </v>

280
00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:54.100
<v Speaker 2>to</v>

281
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:55.250
<v Speaker 1>use sound goofy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

282
00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:57.460
<v Speaker 1>to us they're true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the difference?</v>

283
00:11:57.570 --> 00:11:58.403
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Mormons are fascinating to me </v>

284
00:11:59.041 --> 00:12:03.840
<v Speaker 3>because they do seem goofy when you look</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the idea that Joseph Smith,</v>

285
00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:04.703
<v Speaker 3>who was a 14 year old found golden </v>
<v Speaker 3>tablets that contained a loss work of </v>

286
00:12:07.951 --> 00:12:11.790
<v Speaker 3>Jesus and only he could read them </v>
<v Speaker 3>because he had a magic seer stone.</v>

287
00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:14.940
<v Speaker 3>And then when the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the local townspeople came to see,</v>

288
00:12:14.941 --> 00:12:15.930
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where are these stones?</v>

289
00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:16.793
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the angels came and took them away </v>

290
00:12:17.941 --> 00:12:20.700
<v Speaker 3>because we did not believe like it's so </v>
<v Speaker 3>preposterous.</v>

291
00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:24.390
<v Speaker 3>But Mormons are really nice people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Totally Nice.</v>

292
00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:27.000
<v Speaker 3>They are the best cult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're the sweetest,</v>

293
00:12:27.001 --> 00:12:29.190
<v Speaker 3>nicest place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they've made the transition from</v>

294
00:12:29.191 --> 00:12:33.090
<v Speaker 3>coal to religion to a religious sect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And most,</v>

295
00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.650
<v Speaker 1>most Christians no longer consider them </v>
<v Speaker 1>a cult.</v>

296
00:12:35.651 --> 00:12:37.540
<v Speaker 1>Some evangelicals do because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty far out,</v>

297
00:12:37.541 --> 00:12:40.070
<v Speaker 1>but most mainstream Christian say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

298
00:12:40.071 --> 00:12:40.811
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're Christians.</v>

299
00:12:40.811 --> 00:12:41.644
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they accept Jesus as their savior and </v>

300
00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.250
<v Speaker 1>that technically that gets you in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>club.</v>

301
00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:47.810
<v Speaker 3>They start to let all that Joseph Smith </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff go.</v>

302
00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:48.703
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because they're the way they treat </v>

303
00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.220
<v Speaker 3>people's fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

304
00:12:51.221 --> 00:12:53.510
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a big fan of them going to these</v>

305
00:12:53.511 --> 00:12:56.470
<v Speaker 3>poor countries and proselytizing and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

306
00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:59.600
<v Speaker 3>getting these vulnerable people to </v>
<v Speaker 3>become part,</v>

307
00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:00.613
<v Speaker 3>but I think the way they deal with </v>
<v Speaker 3>community and the way they deal with </v>

308
00:13:03.651 --> 00:13:04.590
<v Speaker 3>each other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a very.</v>

309
00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:09.020
<v Speaker 3>It's a very warm and friendly and family</v>
<v Speaker 3>environment and most of the Mormons that</v>

310
00:13:09.021 --> 00:13:09.854
<v Speaker 3>I've met that are practicing have been </v>
<v Speaker 3>very nice people and they're serious </v>

311
00:13:13.281 --> 00:13:16.940
<v Speaker 3>about their tithing and the 10 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they have strict rules about this</v>

312
00:13:16.941 --> 00:13:19.140
<v Speaker 3>like capital gains that it's equivalent </v>
<v Speaker 3>capital.</v>

313
00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.110
<v Speaker 3>So if you sell your house and make a </v>
<v Speaker 3>profit,</v>

314
00:13:21.111 --> 00:13:22.490
<v Speaker 3>you got to give 10 percent of that to </v>
<v Speaker 3>church,</v>

315
00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:24.350
<v Speaker 3>not just your income,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your paycheck,</v>

316
00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:26.090
<v Speaker 3>and they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're pretty,</v>

317
00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.260
<v Speaker 3>pretty strict about that.</v>

318
00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:29.030
<v Speaker 3>And the money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as far as I know,</v>

319
00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:33.020
<v Speaker 3>mostly goes for good causes that really </v>
<v Speaker 3>does help poor people,</v>

320
00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:34.940
<v Speaker 3>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in your book,</v>

321
00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:39.450
<v Speaker 3>did you go over near death experiences?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a chapter on that.</v>

322
00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:43.040
<v Speaker 3>What do you think is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when people like the ones that have</v>

323
00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:44.293
<v Speaker 3>fascinated me or people in the hospital </v>
<v Speaker 3>bed that see their body from above and </v>

324
00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:51.500
<v Speaker 3>you're dealing with a bunch of chemicals</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are released in the body,</v>

325
00:13:51.501 --> 00:13:52.334
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's morphine and all sorts of </v>

326
00:13:53.571 --> 00:13:54.404
<v Speaker 3>different things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic chemicals and all the </v>

327
00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:00.140
<v Speaker 3>different things that are happening </v>
<v Speaker 3>while your brain is,</v>

328
00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:03.080
<v Speaker 3>is basically on the edge of death,</v>

329
00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:04.103
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's important to remember that </v>

330
00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:07.590
<v Speaker 1>they're near death experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not actually dead.</v>

331
00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:08.453
<v Speaker 1>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a luminal transitional stage </v>

332
00:14:10.981 --> 00:14:14.430
<v Speaker 1>there where you're sliding into some </v>
<v Speaker 1>other state of consciousness,</v>

333
00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:15.653
<v Speaker 1>altered state of consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we know that if you inject or you </v>

334
00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:22.240
<v Speaker 1>take hallucinogens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know those are molech.</v>

335
00:14:22.241 --> 00:14:26.310
<v Speaker 1>Those are molecules that operate on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lock and key mechanism with the synapses</v>

336
00:14:26.311 --> 00:14:29.620
<v Speaker 1>in your brain and your neurons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if they,</v>

337
00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:33.540
<v Speaker 1>these external drugs work in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>molecular lock and key mechanism,</v>

338
00:14:33.541 --> 00:14:38.370
<v Speaker 1>there must be natural chemicals similar </v>
<v Speaker 1>molecularly to that in the brain already</v>

339
00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:39.353
<v Speaker 1>just in smaller doses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one theory about near death </v>

340
00:14:41.611 --> 00:14:42.444
<v Speaker 1>experiences is that a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that this is a way of transitioning </v>

341
00:14:45.421 --> 00:14:46.254
<v Speaker 1>from living dead without feeling anxious</v>
<v Speaker 1>and falling apart and upset and </v>

342
00:14:50.191 --> 00:14:53.270
<v Speaker 1>depressed or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just kind of a smooth feel good,</v>

343
00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:54.453
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>better than a morphine drip kind of way </v>

344
00:14:56.031 --> 00:14:57.170
<v Speaker 1>of making the transition.</v>

345
00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:59.510
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we know for example,</v>

346
00:14:59.511 --> 00:15:00.344
<v Speaker 1>that this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a scientist named Dr James wintery </v>

347
00:15:03.351 --> 00:15:06.050
<v Speaker 1>worked for the United States air force </v>
<v Speaker 1>working with pilots,</v>

348
00:15:06.051 --> 00:15:06.884
<v Speaker 1>accelerating them in a centrifuge and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they would black out this part of their </v>

349
00:15:09.081 --> 00:15:10.460
<v Speaker 1>training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

350
00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:11.510
<v Speaker 1>two g,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three G,</v>

351
00:15:11.511 --> 00:15:14.660
<v Speaker 1>four g boom out you go at some point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 10 g's.</v>

352
00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:17.280
<v Speaker 1>And most of them have these little </v>
<v Speaker 1>dream.</v>

353
00:15:17.281 --> 00:15:20.510
<v Speaker 1>Let states that he called them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are kind of like a.</v>

354
00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:22.970
<v Speaker 1>I saw a tunnel of white light at the end</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the tunnel.</v>

355
00:15:22.971 --> 00:15:23.804
<v Speaker 1>I felt myself floating out of the seat </v>
<v Speaker 1>and having these sort of weird </v>

356
00:15:26.121 --> 00:15:29.090
<v Speaker 1>experiences and we know exactly what </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is.</v>

357
00:15:29.091 --> 00:15:29.924
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the blood is being compressed to the </v>

358
00:15:31.281 --> 00:15:33.260
<v Speaker 1>center of the body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including the center of the brain.</v>

359
00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:35.150
<v Speaker 1>The last thing to go is your brainstem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

360
00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:36.013
<v Speaker 1>keep you alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the Cortex is shutting down from the </v>

361
00:15:37.971 --> 00:15:38.690
<v Speaker 1>outside in.</v>

362
00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:41.630
<v Speaker 1>That would create this kind of tunneling</v>
<v Speaker 1>effect on the back of your skull,</v>

363
00:15:41.631 --> 00:15:44.090
<v Speaker 1>where your visual Cortex is that create </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of that,</v>

364
00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>open brain surgeries.</v>

365
00:15:46.641 --> 00:15:47.474
<v Speaker 1>These are on epileptic patients where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they cut them open and they poke around </v>

366
00:15:51.111 --> 00:15:53.270
<v Speaker 1>to see where the seizures are starting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

367
00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:54.260
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so they could,</v>

368
00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:56.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>zap those neurons instead of some big,</v>

369
00:15:56.571 --> 00:16:00.170
<v Speaker 1>crude a attack and anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so while they're doing that,</v>

370
00:16:00.171 --> 00:16:01.004
<v Speaker 1>they get permission from the patient to </v>
<v Speaker 1>wake them up while they're under a and </v>

371
00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:06.770
<v Speaker 1>the brain is open and they tap around </v>
<v Speaker 1>with electrodes.</v>

372
00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:08.900
<v Speaker 1>So this is one way to map the brain is </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

373
00:16:08.901 --> 00:16:11.060
<v Speaker 1>If so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you report when I tap here?</v>

374
00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:11.923
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just had a vision of my 10th birthday </v>

375
00:16:13.641 --> 00:16:14.510
<v Speaker 1>or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

376
00:16:14.511 --> 00:16:15.470
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where that,</v>

377
00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:17.870
<v Speaker 1>that stored right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

378
00:16:17.871 --> 00:16:19.680
<v Speaker 1>there's another spot right on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

379
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:20.833
<v Speaker 1>the temporal lobes just above your ears </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you can tap it and the person </v>

380
00:16:23.931 --> 00:16:24.321
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

381
00:16:24.321 --> 00:16:25.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm floating out of my body.</v>

382
00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:26.203
<v Speaker 1>I'm up by the ceiling now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you tap it a little to the left on </v>

383
00:16:28.211 --> 00:16:30.490
<v Speaker 1>my left leg is up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my right leg is that night.</v>

384
00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:31.363
<v Speaker 1>My left arm is floating in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My right arm is floating way up here </v>

385
00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:36.260
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm coming back down just by,</v>

386
00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:37.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a Rheostat,</v>

387
00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:38.083
<v Speaker 1>just controlling how much electricity is</v>
<v Speaker 1>going into the neurons in that one </v>

388
00:16:40.851 --> 00:16:41.684
<v Speaker 1>particular spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we know for sure that the near death </v>

389
00:16:44.781 --> 00:16:45.614
<v Speaker 1>experiences are in the brain and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences that the people report are </v>

390
00:16:48.741 --> 00:16:50.350
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have experienced,</v>

391
00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:53.720
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we know it's neurologically based.</v>

392
00:16:53.721 --> 00:16:57.170
<v Speaker 1>Now the counter argument is yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course you have to have your brain to</v>

393
00:16:57.171 --> 00:16:58.004
<v Speaker 1>have experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's kind of a like a doors of </v>

394
00:16:59.601 --> 00:17:04.190
<v Speaker 1>perception opening into this other realm</v>
<v Speaker 1>that these chemicals allow you to do.</v>

395
00:17:04.191 --> 00:17:06.260
<v Speaker 1>It's like it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

396
00:17:06.261 --> 00:17:09.020
<v Speaker 1>I've been talking with Graham Hancock </v>
<v Speaker 1>about Alaska.</v>

397
00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:14.060
<v Speaker 1>He's invited me to come join him and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Arrhythmia in Costa Rica to try this,</v>

398
00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:15.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never tried this and I'm tempted to</v>

399
00:17:15.861 --> 00:17:17.150
<v Speaker 1>go do this to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

400
00:17:17.151 --> 00:17:18.920
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to write about these things.</v>

401
00:17:18.921 --> 00:17:21.110
<v Speaker 1>I should experience it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

402
00:17:21.111 --> 00:17:23.270
<v Speaker 1>but there's a debate amongst people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>do this,</v>

403
00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:24.310
<v Speaker 1>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

404
00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:25.163
<v Speaker 1>Is it strictly just in your head and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not actually going anywhere or </v>

405
00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:32.030
<v Speaker 1>does it open some door to some other </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimension?</v>

406
00:17:32.031 --> 00:17:32.880
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's Kinda the.</v>

407
00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:36.770
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the near death experience,</v>

408
00:17:36.771 --> 00:17:38.750
<v Speaker 1>believers counter that will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

409
00:17:38.751 --> 00:17:39.584
<v Speaker 1>it's in your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it still is taking you somewhere </v>

410
00:17:41.721 --> 00:17:43.440
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is,</v>

411
00:17:43.441 --> 00:17:45.200
<v Speaker 1>is that how you tell the difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>between.</v>

412
00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:46.093
<v Speaker 1>I had a personal experience that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>only way you can share it as if you </v>

413
00:17:48.681 --> 00:17:49.514
<v Speaker 1>actually go through it yourself for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific community that studies as </v>

414
00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:54.243
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There has to be some way to test it </v>

415
00:17:55.201 --> 00:17:57.120
<v Speaker 1>somehow or tell the difference between </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

416
00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:00.060
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the limitations of the scientific method</v>

417
00:18:00.061 --> 00:18:00.894
<v Speaker 1>does because we are dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness and you're dealing with </v>

418
00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:06.840
<v Speaker 1>memories and dreams and ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't measure those either.</v>

419
00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:07.823
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

420
00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:10.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I quote go to other sources.</v>

421
00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:11.191
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So first of all,</v>

422
00:18:11.191 --> 00:18:12.024
<v Speaker 1>I discussed the most famous example is </v>
<v Speaker 1>even Alexander's a trip to have and he </v>

423
00:18:15.661 --> 00:18:16.494
<v Speaker 1>wrote a book called proof of Heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now this is a harvard trained </v>

424
00:18:18.331 --> 00:18:19.164
<v Speaker 1>neurologist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knows more about the brain than I do </v>

425
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:21.833
<v Speaker 1>and so he knows all the research I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to you about and there's a lot </v>

426
00:18:24.211 --> 00:18:25.044
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

427
00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:28.140
<v Speaker 1>But for him it was so powerful and okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's it like?</v>

428
00:18:28.141 --> 00:18:31.440
<v Speaker 1>So he talks about in his book he was in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a coma,</v>

429
00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:32.730
<v Speaker 1>in a hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

430
00:18:32.731 --> 00:18:37.731
<v Speaker 1>So he takes this trip and the colors </v>
<v Speaker 1>were unbelievably intense and rich and I</v>

431
00:18:37.861 --> 00:18:42.861
<v Speaker 1>felt just deep personal love for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people I saw in oneness with the cosmos.</v>

432
00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:47.010
<v Speaker 1>And it goes on and on about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then I quote from Oliver Sacks,</v>

433
00:18:47.011 --> 00:18:47.844
<v Speaker 1>his memoir when the talks about in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sixties when he was dropping acid and </v>

434
00:18:51.571 --> 00:18:54.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the colors were incredibly intense and I</v>

435
00:18:54.301 --> 00:18:55.134
<v Speaker 1>had this incredible feeling of love and </v>
<v Speaker 1>connected and I quote from Sam Harris's </v>

436
00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:00.270
<v Speaker 1>the opening pages of waking up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

437
00:19:00.271 --> 00:19:01.104
<v Speaker 1>I took ecstasy and I'm sitting there on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the couch with my buddy and all of a </v>

438
00:19:03.631 --> 00:19:05.540
<v Speaker 1>sudden I feel this intense love for my </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends.</v>

439
00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:06.773
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

440
00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:09.390
<v Speaker 1>the narratives are indistinguishable to </v>
<v Speaker 1>an outsider.</v>

441
00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:10.733
<v Speaker 1>So how do you know that you're actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to heaven or you're just having a </v>

442
00:19:12.811 --> 00:19:14.270
<v Speaker 1>fantastic trip?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

443
00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:16.110
<v Speaker 1>it's entirely possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's both.</v>

444
00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:18.750
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so how do we know?</v>

445
00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:20.003
<v Speaker 1>We don't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the real problem is people </v>

446
00:19:21.271 --> 00:19:23.300
<v Speaker 1>saying that they know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

447
00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:25.320
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saying that I know that I was in another</v>

448
00:19:25.321 --> 00:19:26.154
<v Speaker 1>dimension.</v>

449
00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:27.853
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's entirely possible that your </v>

450
00:19:29.401 --> 00:19:33.810
<v Speaker 1>consciousness is capable of going </v>
<v Speaker 1>through these chemical doorways that are</v>

451
00:19:33.811 --> 00:19:38.811
<v Speaker 1>created by these molecules and that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences some frequency on the,</v>

452
00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:42.420
<v Speaker 1>on the dial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if there's a radio dial,</v>

453
00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:46.950
<v Speaker 1>maybe we're at 95 point five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can get to 97 if you take,</v>

454
00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:49.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>x amount of milligrams of diamonds,</v>

455
00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:51.750
<v Speaker 1>tryptamine and then you go to this new </v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

456
00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:52.703
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this still physically here and Elvis </v>

457
00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:57.330
<v Speaker 1>Huxley's book the doors of perception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

458
00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:59.400
<v Speaker 1>Which supposedly is where the door has </v>
<v Speaker 1>got their name,</v>

459
00:19:59.401 --> 00:20:02.910
<v Speaker 1>but somebody told me that that's a meme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not true,</v>

460
00:20:02.911 --> 00:20:03.744
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

461
00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:05.130
<v Speaker 1>but that's the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

462
00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:07.680
<v Speaker 1>sounds good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

463
00:20:07.681 --> 00:20:12.681
<v Speaker 1>but really what you're getting at is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>super core problem of what is truth,</v>

464
00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:13.603
<v Speaker 1>how do you know that it was so mystical </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences are by definition personal </v>

465
00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:22.580
<v Speaker 1>and you can't corroborate them through </v>
<v Speaker 1>some external scientific method.</v>

466
00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:25.670
<v Speaker 1>So I mean science is based on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the,</v>

467
00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:30.540
<v Speaker 1>on the act that we can falsify a claim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can test it somehow and that it's not</v>

468
00:20:30.541 --> 00:20:31.374
<v Speaker 1>just me pointing to something and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's true because I </v>

469
00:20:34.111 --> 00:20:35.530
<v Speaker 1>experienced that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

470
00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:38.490
<v Speaker 1>So I wrote a column in scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>American about this called.</v>

471
00:20:38.491 --> 00:20:40.720
<v Speaker 1>What is truth is I started off with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lie.</v>

472
00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:44.280
<v Speaker 1>The truth for me is that dark </v>
<v Speaker 1>chocolate's better than milk chocolate.</v>

473
00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:45.213
<v Speaker 1>Then maybe you say no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>milk chocolate's better than dark </v>

474
00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:47.763
<v Speaker 1>chocolate and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no way we're going to resolve </v>

475
00:20:49.601 --> 00:20:51.510
<v Speaker 1>that because the truth is that that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>just preference.</v>

476
00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:52.403
<v Speaker 1>That's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an internal state or I say the </v>

477
00:20:54.281 --> 00:20:55.440
<v Speaker 1>other example I use is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

478
00:20:55.441 --> 00:20:57.610
<v Speaker 1>the stairway to heaven is the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 1>rock song of all time.</v>

479
00:20:57.611 --> 00:20:58.211
<v Speaker 1>Then you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

480
00:20:58.211 --> 00:20:59.960
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>freebird is better than stairway to.</v>

481
00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:00.490
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

482
00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:01.900
<v Speaker 1>You can't resolve these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

483
00:21:01.901 --> 00:21:06.430
<v Speaker 1>So you slide there from into things like</v>
<v Speaker 1>these personal experiences we have.</v>

484
00:21:06.431 --> 00:21:09.880
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what I think Graham is hoping if I go</v>

485
00:21:09.881 --> 00:21:12.940
<v Speaker 1>to rhythmia and try Iowaska and I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

486
00:21:12.941 --> 00:21:13.774
<v Speaker 1>I report this fantastic experience I had</v>
<v Speaker 1>was literally I'll have this and then </v>

487
00:21:17.381 --> 00:21:18.214
<v Speaker 1>it'll be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll did I Michael Shermer go to this </v>

488
00:21:19.991 --> 00:21:20.824
<v Speaker 1>other dimension and now I really kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a skeptic need to renounce my pure </v>

489
00:21:23.771 --> 00:21:27.040
<v Speaker 1>materialistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>monistic a belief in,</v>

490
00:21:27.041 --> 00:21:27.520
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

491
00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:29.800
<v Speaker 1>in admit there's a dualistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another side.</v>

492
00:21:29.801 --> 00:21:30.634
<v Speaker 1>There's the spirit side or something and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not at all sure I could do that </v>

493
00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:36.580
<v Speaker 1>because how would I get out of my own </v>
<v Speaker 1>head and say,</v>

494
00:21:36.581 --> 00:21:39.520
<v Speaker 1>I know for sure that I went to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>other place because I wouldn't know</v>

495
00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:41.530
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most certainly don't know you,</v>

496
00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:42.383
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know that the experience was a real </v>

497
00:21:43.791 --> 00:21:48.070
<v Speaker 3>experience in terms of the fact that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>had it like you,</v>

498
00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:51.380
<v Speaker 3>you felt the things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't done Iowasca,</v>

499
00:21:51.381 --> 00:21:52.214
<v Speaker 3>but I've done the active ingredient and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Iowasca many times it's </v>

500
00:21:54.081 --> 00:21:57.300
<v Speaker 3>dimethyltryptamine and it's more potent </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the form that I've done in it.</v>

501
00:21:57.620 --> 00:21:58.910
<v Speaker 3>It's a shorter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lasting,</v>

502
00:21:58.911 --> 00:22:03.911
<v Speaker 3>much more potent experience and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>undeniably phenomenal.</v>

503
00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:06.730
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is very crazy.</v>

504
00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:07.623
<v Speaker 3>It's impossible to describe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would throw some words around and do </v>

505
00:22:11.171 --> 00:22:12.670
<v Speaker 3>my best,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it won't work.</v>

506
00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:14.860
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The trip itself,</v>

507
00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:16.023
<v Speaker 3>what's really bizarre,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of really bizarre aspects </v>

508
00:22:18.521 --> 00:22:19.354
<v Speaker 3>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but one of the things is really bizarre </v>

509
00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:20.823
<v Speaker 3>is the feeling that you've been there </v>
<v Speaker 3>before him and the speculation and </v>

510
00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:26.860
<v Speaker 3>Terence Mckenna talked about this pretty</v>
<v Speaker 3>in depth.</v>

511
00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:28.143
<v Speaker 3>One of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the speculations is that when </v>

512
00:22:29.591 --> 00:22:33.510
<v Speaker 3>you're in rem sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're experiencing some form of dime,</v>

513
00:22:33.511 --> 00:22:38.020
<v Speaker 3>Ethel tryptamine in that your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your liver,</v>

514
00:22:38.021 --> 00:22:38.230
<v Speaker 3>your.</v>

515
00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:41.230
<v Speaker 3>They know for a fact that it's produced </v>
<v Speaker 3>by your liver and your lungs,</v>

516
00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:42.933
<v Speaker 3>and now they know the used to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>anecdotal evidence that was produced by </v>

517
00:22:45.191 --> 00:22:46.024
<v Speaker 3>the pineal gland,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is of course the third eye in </v>

518
00:22:48.281 --> 00:22:50.740
<v Speaker 3>reptiles and certain reptiles that </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually has a retina.</v>

519
00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:51.793
<v Speaker 3>We didn't literally is in the center of </v>
<v Speaker 3>your head where the eastern mysticism </v>

520
00:22:54.851 --> 00:22:55.684
<v Speaker 3>third it exists right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They know that in rats because of the </v>

521
00:22:58.841 --> 00:23:03.190
<v Speaker 3>cottonwood research foundation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is something that Dr Richard,</v>

522
00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:04.143
<v Speaker 3>Rick Strassman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was the guy who wrote the book dmt </v>

523
00:23:06.941 --> 00:23:07.940
<v Speaker 3>the spirit molecule,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

524
00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:08.853
<v Speaker 3>He was the guy who got the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>federally approved tests done on </v>

525
00:23:12.611 --> 00:23:16.510
<v Speaker 3>dimethyltryptamine clinic trials and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an amazing book,</v>

526
00:23:16.511 --> 00:23:17.800
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really fascinating.</v>

527
00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:18.693
<v Speaker 3>And he was a part of this cotton we'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>Research Foundation and they've now </v>

528
00:23:22.871 --> 00:23:26.980
<v Speaker 3>proven that in live rats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pineal gland produces dmt.</v>

529
00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:29.050
<v Speaker 3>Obviously that doesn't produce an in </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

530
00:23:29.051 --> 00:23:30.430
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very hopeful to.</v>

531
00:23:30.431 --> 00:23:31.600
<v Speaker 3>Do you have other mammals.</v>

532
00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:32.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

533
00:23:32.761 --> 00:23:33.594
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the molecular lock and key mechanism </v>

534
00:23:35.161 --> 00:23:38.040
<v Speaker 1>is set up in the brain already for this </v>
<v Speaker 1>external drug to work,</v>

535
00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:40.200
<v Speaker 1>there must be something like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>already.</v>

536
00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:42.920
<v Speaker 1>That's in the brain that evolved for </v>
<v Speaker 1>some reason.</v>

537
00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:46.090
<v Speaker 3>Are you aware of the correlation between</v>
<v Speaker 3>this and Moses</v>

538
00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:48.160
<v Speaker 2>is burning Bush?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

539
00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:49.780
<v Speaker 2>I've heard ideas about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

540
00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:54.290
<v Speaker 2>Jerusalem scholars believed now that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>burning Bush may very well have been the</v>

541
00:23:54.291 --> 00:23:57.170
<v Speaker 2>occasional Bush.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bush is a tree.</v>

542
00:23:57.171 --> 00:24:00.700
<v Speaker 2>It's rich and dimethyltryptamine so that</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is.</v>

543
00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:01.550
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sort.</v>

544
00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:03.290
<v Speaker 2>He's tripping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think we're getting.</v>

545
00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:07.250
<v Speaker 2>We have to realize when we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>translating things from the Bible,</v>

546
00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:09.380
<v Speaker 2>when you're translating from ancient </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hebrew,</v>

547
00:24:09.381 --> 00:24:14.381
<v Speaker 2>which is incredibly unusual language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where letters also double as numbers and</v>

548
00:24:15.651 --> 00:24:16.484
<v Speaker 2>like the letter a is also the number one</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's a numerical value to words </v>

549
00:24:20.541 --> 00:24:21.374
<v Speaker 2>and it's a very weird language to </v>
<v Speaker 2>translate to Latin and Greek into </v>

550
00:24:25.971 --> 00:24:26.804
<v Speaker 2>English,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so when we're hearing that Moses </v>

551
00:24:28.581 --> 00:24:29.414
<v Speaker 2>experienced a burning Bush and that this</v>
<v Speaker 2>burning Bush was God and God gave him </v>

552
00:24:33.621 --> 00:24:35.210
<v Speaker 2>these commandments on how to live your </v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

553
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:36.823
<v Speaker 2>It's entirely possible that Moses was </v>
<v Speaker 2>tripping on dmt and that this burning </v>

554
00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:41.083
<v Speaker 2>Bush,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that what we're getting is an </v>

555
00:24:42.861 --> 00:24:47.861
<v Speaker 2>interpretation of somehow they had a dmt</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience from smoking this Bush,</v>

556
00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:49.880
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

557
00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:50.713
<v Speaker 2>Smoking some aspects of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They figured out how to extract it or </v>

558
00:24:53.271 --> 00:24:54.230
<v Speaker 2>how to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

559
00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:57.660
<v Speaker 2>isolated and they had a </v>
<v Speaker 2>dimethyltryptamine experience.</v>

560
00:24:57.661 --> 00:24:59.390
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which pretty much makes sense.</v>

561
00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:01.070
<v Speaker 2>That totally makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we get,</v>

562
00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:02.383
<v Speaker 2>we get articles submitted all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It skeptic magazine of people that </v>

563
00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:08.510
<v Speaker 2>attempt to make natural explanations for</v>
<v Speaker 2>biblical phenomena,</v>

564
00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:11.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Red Sea party because it was a giant</v>

565
00:25:11.001 --> 00:25:11.834
<v Speaker 2>earthquake or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the meteor strike cause the skies to </v>

566
00:25:14.811 --> 00:25:16.250
<v Speaker 2>turn red and that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

567
00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:18.440
<v Speaker 2>that the plagues of frogs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

568
00:25:18.441 --> 00:25:19.700
<v Speaker 2>that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

569
00:25:19.701 --> 00:25:20.534
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although we published one in which the </v>

570
00:25:22.641 --> 00:25:25.610
<v Speaker 2>argument was that Jesus was never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he never died.</v>

571
00:25:25.611 --> 00:25:30.611
<v Speaker 2>He was in a deep coma on the cross and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that one of his followers had stabbed,</v>

572
00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:33.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he got stabbed in the side with the</v>

573
00:25:33.471 --> 00:25:37.020
<v Speaker 2>wound that it actually had some chemical</v>
<v Speaker 2>that put them in this coma and then they</v>

574
00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:38.360
<v Speaker 2>sort of a Dan Brown thing.</v>

575
00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:40.780
<v Speaker 2>They whisked him off and put them in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>cave and then,</v>

576
00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:41.703
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then stole him and he ended up in </v>

577
00:25:42.621 --> 00:25:44.830
<v Speaker 2>France or India or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

578
00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:47.570
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I published it because I thought,</v>

579
00:25:47.571 --> 00:25:48.860
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there might be something to that.</v>

580
00:25:48.861 --> 00:25:50.750
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I like those kinds of explanations.</v>

581
00:25:50.751 --> 00:25:51.584
<v Speaker 2>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you go into sorta your Joseph </v>

582
00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:57.380
<v Speaker 2>Campbell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jordan Peterson role of thinking,</v>

583
00:25:57.381 --> 00:25:58.214
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe these stories or doing something </v>

584
00:25:59.241 --> 00:26:02.960
<v Speaker 2>else entirely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>none of this stuff actually happened the</v>

585
00:26:02.961 --> 00:26:03.794
<v Speaker 2>way it's described.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The stories are there to convey some </v>

586
00:26:05.781 --> 00:26:10.460
<v Speaker 2>moral homily or some message about how </v>
<v Speaker 2>we should behave or act and that kind of</v>

587
00:26:10.461 --> 00:26:11.900
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm always conflicted about,</v>

588
00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:12.753
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do I really want a natural explanation </v>

589
00:26:14.061 --> 00:26:15.710
<v Speaker 2>for this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do we need to go that path?</v>

590
00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:18.080
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe the stories they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually happened.</v>

591
00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:19.063
<v Speaker 2>Moses has never really existed or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people never lived in the desert for 40 </v>

592
00:26:23.391 --> 00:26:25.940
<v Speaker 2>years because there's no archeological </v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence that this ever happened.</v>

593
00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:28.700
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it didn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's a story that represents,</v>

594
00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:29.871
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>destruction,</v>

595
00:26:29.871 --> 00:26:31.210
<v Speaker 2>redemption,</v>
<v Speaker 2>starting over,</v>

596
00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:32.540
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

597
00:26:32.541 --> 00:26:33.410
<v Speaker 2>more likely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

598
00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:35.270
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you aware at all of,</v>

599
00:26:35.271 --> 00:26:36.104
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any of the translations from the Dead </v>

600
00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:39.550
<v Speaker 2>Sea Scrolls?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't followed that too.</v>

601
00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:43.530
<v Speaker 2>There's a fascinating book to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fascinating books that were written by a</v>

602
00:26:43.531 --> 00:26:43.980
<v Speaker 2>guy named</v>

603
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:48.900
<v Speaker 3>John Marco Allegro and John Mark Allegra</v>
<v Speaker 3>was a scholar who was hired to be one of</v>

604
00:26:48.901 --> 00:26:49.734
<v Speaker 3>the people to decipher the Dead Sea </v>
<v Speaker 3>Scrolls and he deciphered them for over </v>

605
00:26:53.071 --> 00:26:53.904
<v Speaker 3>14 years and wrote a book called the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sacred mushroom and the cross and his </v>

606
00:26:58.291 --> 00:26:59.124
<v Speaker 3>interpretation was that the entire </v>
<v Speaker 3>Christian religion was a massive </v>

607
00:27:02.701 --> 00:27:06.420
<v Speaker 3>misunderstanding and what it really was </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the original,</v>

608
00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:11.280
<v Speaker 3>the original religion was based on was </v>
<v Speaker 3>the consumption of psychedelic mushrooms</v>

609
00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:12.263
<v Speaker 3>and fertility cults and all of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>ancient parables were really just ways </v>

610
00:27:19.201 --> 00:27:23.400
<v Speaker 3>that they could retain the knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 3>while hiding it from the Romans.</v>

611
00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:27.150
<v Speaker 3>So they did it in the store stories and </v>
<v Speaker 3>parables,</v>

612
00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:32.270
<v Speaker 3>and he even traces back the word Christ </v>
<v Speaker 3>to an ancient Sumeria word,</v>

613
00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:35.300
<v Speaker 3>which means a mushroom covered in God's </v>
<v Speaker 3>semen.</v>

614
00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:37.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what.</v>

615
00:27:37.171 --> 00:27:38.550
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

616
00:27:38.551 --> 00:27:39.384
<v Speaker 3>Book has actually bought out by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Catholic Church and then reprinted </v>

617
00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:47.660
<v Speaker 3>recently by a guy named Irvin and he did</v>
<v Speaker 3>it like a five or six years ago,</v>

618
00:27:49.651 --> 00:27:50.340
<v Speaker 3>maybe more.</v>

619
00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:52.020
<v Speaker 3>He.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He reprints so you can buy it now,</v>

620
00:27:52.021 --> 00:27:52.854
<v Speaker 3>but I have two copies of it that were </v>
<v Speaker 3>original prints that I bought from a </v>

621
00:27:55.321 --> 00:27:56.154
<v Speaker 3>long time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they bought it out and send it out </v>

622
00:27:59.010 --> 00:27:59.811
<v Speaker 3>to get rid of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

623
00:27:59.811 --> 00:28:00.644
<v Speaker 3>to get rid of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then John Marco Allegro wrote a </v>

624
00:28:02.401 --> 00:28:06.180
<v Speaker 3>second book called the Dead Sea Scrolls </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the Christian myth,</v>

625
00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:08.250
<v Speaker 3>after they bought out his first book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

626
00:28:08.251 --> 00:28:09.084
<v Speaker 3>So he has two books that are available </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are basically supporting this </v>

627
00:28:11.071 --> 00:28:11.904
<v Speaker 3>theory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the idea was that rain would come </v>

628
00:28:13.831 --> 00:28:18.831
<v Speaker 3>down and the people at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have to consider the fact that infant</v>

629
00:28:18.871 --> 00:28:19.704
<v Speaker 3>mortality was incredibly high back then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People died all the time and fertility </v>

630
00:28:23.071 --> 00:28:23.904
<v Speaker 3>was very unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one really understood why people got </v>

631
00:28:25.921 --> 00:28:29.160
<v Speaker 3>pregnant or how they got pregnant or </v>
<v Speaker 3>what kept people from getting pregnant.</v>

632
00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:30.353
<v Speaker 3>And so people were constantly concerned </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the possibility of them going </v>

633
00:28:33.931 --> 00:28:37.290
<v Speaker 3>extinct and they really were concerned </v>
<v Speaker 3>with villages getting wiped out,</v>

634
00:28:37.291 --> 00:28:38.490
<v Speaker 3>their family getting wiped out.</v>

635
00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:39.323
<v Speaker 3>So they were very concerned with </v>
<v Speaker 3>fertility and they thought that when it </v>

636
00:28:42.721 --> 00:28:43.554
<v Speaker 3>rained,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these mushrooms that came out of the </v>

637
00:28:44.911 --> 00:28:46.230
<v Speaker 3>ground,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they came out of nowhere.</v>

638
00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:47.910
<v Speaker 3>Like you know how quick a mushroom </v>
<v Speaker 3>grows.</v>

639
00:28:47.911 --> 00:28:49.290
<v Speaker 3>It's not like a plant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

640
00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:51.930
<v Speaker 3>So if there's a spore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which by the way,</v>

641
00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:52.853
<v Speaker 3>their spores everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's my sealyham that's underneath </v>

642
00:28:55.441 --> 00:28:56.274
<v Speaker 3>the earth and everywhere you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's the potential for the growth of </v>

643
00:28:59.221 --> 00:29:00.054
<v Speaker 3>these mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the rain comes down and then almost </v>

644
00:29:02.671 --> 00:29:05.730
<v Speaker 3>instantaneously these mushrooms blossom </v>
<v Speaker 3>up out of the ground,</v>

645
00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:07.170
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You eat these mushrooms,</v>

646
00:29:07.171 --> 00:29:09.420
<v Speaker 3>you have intense psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiences.</v>

647
00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:12.300
<v Speaker 3>You gather them up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you hide it from the Romans,</v>

648
00:29:12.301 --> 00:29:13.134
<v Speaker 3>you hide it from everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't want people to know that this is </v>

649
00:29:15.121 --> 00:29:15.954
<v Speaker 3>your portal to God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they had all these stories that </v>

650
00:29:18.541 --> 00:29:19.374
<v Speaker 3>they hit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I don't know if he's right and I'm </v>

651
00:29:21.031 --> 00:29:25.320
<v Speaker 3>not a religious scholar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nor am I an expert in ancient languages,</v>

652
00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:26.730
<v Speaker 3>but it's incredibly compelling.</v>

653
00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:28.720
<v Speaker 3>It's really fascinating stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>

654
00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:31.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a legit rock solid scholar,</v>

655
00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:32.221
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

656
00:29:32.221 --> 00:29:33.300
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

657
00:29:33.301 --> 00:29:34.134
<v Speaker 3>he was also an ordained minister and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>only one that was on the Dead Sea </v>

658
00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:39.473
<v Speaker 3>Scrolls deciphering group that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>agnostic because through his study of </v>

659
00:29:44.741 --> 00:29:45.574
<v Speaker 3>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once he became an ordained minister and </v>

660
00:29:47.501 --> 00:29:51.370
<v Speaker 3>then became a scholar through a study of</v>
<v Speaker 3>religion,</v>

661
00:29:51.371 --> 00:29:52.151
<v Speaker 3>he realized like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

662
00:29:52.151 --> 00:29:54.400
<v Speaker 3>these are all like ancient weird </v>
<v Speaker 3>stories,</v>

663
00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:55.533
<v Speaker 3>and they're all incredibly similar and </v>
<v Speaker 3>as you go back and time you find the </v>

664
00:29:58.781 --> 00:29:59.614
<v Speaker 3>similarities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And coon Bron is where they found the </v>

665
00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:04.120
<v Speaker 3>Dead Sea Scrolls is the oldest version </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the Bible.</v>

666
00:30:04.121 --> 00:30:07.330
<v Speaker 3>The only one that's written in in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's the only one that's written</v>

667
00:30:07.331 --> 00:30:08.580
<v Speaker 3>in Aramaic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

668
00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:09.513
<v Speaker 3>They.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They actually had to do DNA tests </v>

669
00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:12.153
<v Speaker 3>because the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Qumran scrolls were written on </v>

670
00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:17.920
<v Speaker 3>animal skins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they had to do dna tests on the skins</v>

671
00:30:17.921 --> 00:30:18.340
<v Speaker 3>left.</v>

672
00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:22.510
<v Speaker 3>So the one they could match up the </v>
<v Speaker 3>pieces to the right animal.</v>

673
00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:25.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they had a match up the pieces of the</v>

674
00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:27.970
<v Speaker 3>scroll when they were trying to piece it</v>
<v Speaker 3>all together,</v>

675
00:30:27.971 --> 00:30:31.240
<v Speaker 3>like a gigantic jigsaw puzzle took them </v>
<v Speaker 3>forever to do.</v>

676
00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:32.403
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do remember a controversy from a few </v>

677
00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:36.910
<v Speaker 3>years ago of the the Dead Sea Scrolls </v>
<v Speaker 3>Committee,</v>

678
00:30:36.911 --> 00:30:41.590
<v Speaker 3>whoever controls them were not very </v>
<v Speaker 3>forthcoming about what they were finding</v>

679
00:30:41.591 --> 00:30:44.800
<v Speaker 3>and letting go and letting outsiders </v>
<v Speaker 3>look at the originals.</v>

680
00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:45.673
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some wacky stuff in there </v>

681
00:30:46.061 --> 00:30:47.230
<v Speaker 3>apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

682
00:30:47.231 --> 00:30:48.130
<v Speaker 3>And also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

683
00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:49.083
<v Speaker 3>intellectual groups like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they tend to circle the wagons were the </v>

684
00:30:51.071 --> 00:30:51.904
<v Speaker 3>elite special experts and you can't look</v>
<v Speaker 3>at these things and I think there's </v>

685
00:30:54.641 --> 00:30:55.474
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think there's also like if you're </v>

686
00:30:56.840 --> 00:31:01.840
<v Speaker 3>gonna go by the way Christianity set up </v>
<v Speaker 3>those stories are,</v>

687
00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:07.810
<v Speaker 3>this is what everything is based on as </v>
<v Speaker 3>many Moses,</v>

688
00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:08.703
<v Speaker 3>Joseph,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these different characters that </v>

689
00:31:10.650 --> 00:31:12.070
<v Speaker 3>those stories are completely different.</v>

690
00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:14.420
<v Speaker 3>Apparently in the Dead Sea Scrolls and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of wacky stuff.</v>

691
00:31:14.421 --> 00:31:15.254
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

692
00:31:15.370 --> 00:31:18.370
<v Speaker 3>Things coming from the sky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like alien type stuff,</v>

693
00:31:18.371 --> 00:31:19.950
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Weird Shit and right.</v>

694
00:31:20.050 --> 00:31:21.430
<v Speaker 3>People were probably tripping their </v>
<v Speaker 3>balls off.</v>

695
00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:23.650
<v Speaker 3>You're probably.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's what I think.</v>

696
00:31:23.651 --> 00:31:28.651
<v Speaker 3>It's entirely possible that the Zico </v>
<v Speaker 3>story about the thing in this guy,</v>

697
00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:34.230
<v Speaker 3>and of course the ecologists think well </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they were seeing a Ufo but other.</v>

698
00:31:34.290 --> 00:31:34.661
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

699
00:31:34.661 --> 00:31:35.494
<v Speaker 3>They were tripping and I was much more </v>
<v Speaker 3>likely that we know for fact that </v>

700
00:31:38.711 --> 00:31:39.544
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic mushrooms existed back then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is the easiest thing in the world to </v>

701
00:31:42.611 --> 00:31:44.580
<v Speaker 3>see a mushroom pick it up and eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

702
00:31:44.581 --> 00:31:45.414
<v Speaker 3>So when people did it all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they experimented with food all the </v>

703
00:31:47.591 --> 00:31:48.424
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There were no books to look up to see </v>

704
00:31:49.601 --> 00:31:52.540
<v Speaker 3>which are the good ones to eat according</v>
<v Speaker 3>to completely make sense.</v>

705
00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:54.350
<v Speaker 3>Completely makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

706
00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:58.390
<v Speaker 3>And there's also in a lot of really </v>
<v Speaker 3>ancient religious art,</v>

707
00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:03.420
<v Speaker 3>there's tremendous mushroom iconic </v>
<v Speaker 3>photographs of these paintings.</v>

708
00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:05.140
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a tremendous,</v>

709
00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:08.740
<v Speaker 3>tremendous amount of mushroom imagery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ancient Christian art.</v>

710
00:32:08.890 --> 00:32:10.720
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the actual halo,</v>

711
00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:11.843
<v Speaker 3>the halo used to be different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Halo that we see now is like a hula </v>

712
00:32:15.281 --> 00:32:16.870
<v Speaker 3>hoop around guys heads,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

713
00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:20.230
<v Speaker 3>But the old Hailu used to look like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bottom of a mushroom cap.</v>

714
00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:21.320
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever seen,</v>

715
00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:24.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see if you can find those images.</v>

716
00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:25.113
<v Speaker 3>I wrote an article a long time ago </v>
<v Speaker 3>called Santa Claus wasn't mushroom </v>

717
00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:30.070
<v Speaker 3>because Sam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

718
00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:30.913
<v Speaker 3>the Amany to miscarry a mushroom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that this is all based on looks like </v>

719
00:32:34.391 --> 00:32:35.224
<v Speaker 3>Santa Claus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a white and red mushroom and a lot </v>

720
00:32:37.511 --> 00:32:40.070
<v Speaker 3>of people and it has a microrisal </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship with</v>

721
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:42.080
<v Speaker 2>the coniferous tree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's the.</v>

722
00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:43.970
<v Speaker 2>That's the mushroom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The ammunition was scary,</v>

723
00:32:43.971 --> 00:32:45.200
<v Speaker 2>but if you scroll down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>

724
00:32:45.201 --> 00:32:47.960
<v Speaker 2>there's an image of see like there's all</v>
<v Speaker 2>those elves.</v>

725
00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:49.900
<v Speaker 2>Look at the old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at the.</v>

726
00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:54.380
<v Speaker 2>Scroll up to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Elves up those elves.</v>

727
00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:55.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was.</v>

728
00:32:55.850 --> 00:32:56.683
<v Speaker 2>It was all Christmas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like ancient Christmas images were </v>

729
00:32:59.511 --> 00:33:00.344
<v Speaker 2>connected to that mushroom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now scroll down to those images of the </v>

730
00:33:03.170 --> 00:33:05.300
<v Speaker 2>halo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A look at the old halo.</v>

731
00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:08.150
<v Speaker 2>The Halo looks like the bottom of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>mushroom cap.</v>

732
00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:09.043
<v Speaker 2>It does kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the idea was those aren't like </v>

733
00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:14.010
<v Speaker 2>markings or letters or numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to tell.</v>

734
00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:14.873
<v Speaker 2>Just lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

735
00:33:15.090 --> 00:33:18.860
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of those though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a ton of those images of ancient</v>

736
00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:20.473
<v Speaker 2>religious figures with that circle </v>
<v Speaker 2>behind them with all those lines that </v>

737
00:33:23.721 --> 00:33:26.480
<v Speaker 2>look exactly like the underside of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>mushroom county,</v>

738
00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:27.463
<v Speaker 2>and the idea was that these enlightened </v>
<v Speaker 2>people were under the influence of </v>

739
00:33:30.801 --> 00:33:31.370
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms.</v>

740
00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:34.490
<v Speaker 2>That's why they had the halo on voice to</v>
<v Speaker 2>designate like,</v>

741
00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:36.680
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the guy who was on mushrooms.</v>

742
00:33:36.681 --> 00:33:39.080
<v Speaker 2>We've taught us all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like that.</v>

743
00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:40.093
<v Speaker 2>I like that idea better than Ufo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know it's a real thing running and </v>

744
00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:45.200
<v Speaker 2>nobody can look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you think you're brave,</v>

745
00:33:45.410 --> 00:33:48.710
<v Speaker 2>go eat five dried grams of psilocybin </v>
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms.</v>

746
00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:52.100
<v Speaker 2>Good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't tell me they don't work.</v>

747
00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:53.610
<v Speaker 2>They work on everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't.</v>

748
00:33:53.730 --> 00:33:54.563
<v Speaker 2>They don't work whether or not you </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe or not believe they just work </v>

749
00:33:57.290 --> 00:33:58.123
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's an easy way to see if you </v>

750
00:34:01.461 --> 00:34:03.140
<v Speaker 2>just took them and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

751
00:34:03.530 --> 00:34:05.370
<v Speaker 2>I see why these people thought this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

752
00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:07.273
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my favorite biblical scholar to read is </v>

753
00:34:08.121 --> 00:34:09.650
<v Speaker 2>Bart Erhman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dino barter mill.</v>

754
00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:11.390
<v Speaker 2>He Does A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

755
00:34:11.391 --> 00:34:12.224
<v Speaker 2>he started off as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a Bible scholar because he was a </v>

756
00:34:14.331 --> 00:34:16.400
<v Speaker 2>believer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He went to the Moody Bible College.</v>

757
00:34:16.401 --> 00:34:18.740
<v Speaker 2>He was going to be a preacher and </v>
<v Speaker 2>evangelical in the whole thing.</v>

758
00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:21.020
<v Speaker 2>And then he went to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was Princeton theological and</v>

759
00:34:21.021 --> 00:34:23.270
<v Speaker 2>he found out how the book was really </v>
<v Speaker 2>written.</v>

760
00:34:23.470 --> 00:34:24.330
<v Speaker 2>It's awakened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

761
00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:26.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an edited volume with lots and lots</v>

762
00:34:26.541 --> 00:34:29.000
<v Speaker 2>of people coming in later and modifying </v>
<v Speaker 2>this and,</v>

763
00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:30.153
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and debunking some previous Old </v>

764
00:34:31.551 --> 00:34:36.080
<v Speaker 2>Testament in a story or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he ended up being an atheist or</v>

765
00:34:36.170 --> 00:34:37.700
<v Speaker 2>agnostic or something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever he is,</v>

766
00:34:37.701 --> 00:34:38.534
<v Speaker 2>he not believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is sort of the atheist favorite </v>

767
00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:44.840
<v Speaker 2>biblical scholar because he doesn't come</v>
<v Speaker 2>at it with a religious belief,</v>

768
00:34:44.841 --> 00:34:45.674
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got a bunch of teaching company </v>

769
00:34:46.671 --> 00:34:47.504
<v Speaker 2>courses where he deconstruct how Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how Jesus became the Messiah or God or </v>

770
00:34:51.501 --> 00:34:52.940
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

771
00:34:52.941 --> 00:34:53.774
<v Speaker 2>the Old Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the new testament with these books mean </v>

772
00:34:55.311 --> 00:34:56.690
<v Speaker 2>and it's a bit like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

773
00:34:56.810 --> 00:34:57.800
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jordan Peterson,</v>

774
00:34:57.801 --> 00:34:58.634
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to talk for two hours about </v>

775
00:34:59.631 --> 00:35:02.810
<v Speaker 2>genesis one one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can you talk for so long?</v>

776
00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:05.420
<v Speaker 2>Just a single chapter in a book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

777
00:35:05.421 --> 00:35:06.254
<v Speaker 2>and well there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of historical </v>

778
00:35:07.551 --> 00:35:10.820
<v Speaker 2>interpretation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I do know art historians will look at</v>

779
00:35:10.821 --> 00:35:13.490
<v Speaker 2>those Halos or the thing in the sky that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Ufo,</v>

780
00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:14.691
<v Speaker 2>the UFO.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

781
00:35:14.691 --> 00:35:15.524
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually at that time that artists were </v>

782
00:35:17.991 --> 00:35:20.570
<v Speaker 2>putting those things in the sky for this</v>
<v Speaker 2>other reason.</v>

783
00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:21.141
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

784
00:35:21.141 --> 00:35:21.974
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's good to have some historical </v>

785
00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:27.080
<v Speaker 2>background to the text or the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

786
00:35:27.081 --> 00:35:28.760
<v Speaker 2>I don't read Hebrew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Greek,</v>

787
00:35:28.761 --> 00:35:29.594
<v Speaker 2>Aramaic or Latin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so I'm trusting the King James </v>

788
00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:33.410
<v Speaker 2>Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I really shouldn't,</v>

789
00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:34.273
<v Speaker 2>so I rely on people like Bart who can </v>
<v Speaker 2>read it in the oldest version we have </v>

790
00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:38.100
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

791
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:40.350
<v Speaker 1>know that word actually means this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

792
00:35:40.351 --> 00:35:42.600
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would be.</v>

793
00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:46.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you could get into a time machine and</v>

794
00:35:46.111 --> 00:35:50.880
<v Speaker 1>go to any time in history and just see </v>
<v Speaker 1>what it was like how people behaved.</v>

795
00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:51.753
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be real tempted to go to ancient </v>

796
00:35:53.011 --> 00:35:53.844
<v Speaker 1>Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'd also really be tempted to go to </v>

797
00:35:56.610 --> 00:35:58.800
<v Speaker 1>around the time of Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

798
00:35:58.801 --> 00:36:01.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't necessarily even know if Christ </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a real human,</v>

799
00:36:01.770 --> 00:36:04.770
<v Speaker 1>but I would love to see what life was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like back then.</v>

800
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:08.030
<v Speaker 1>Bart Bart thinks he probably did exist </v>
<v Speaker 1>and obviously not the Messiah,</v>

801
00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:08.873
<v Speaker 1>not the supernatural step,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that somebody like that or by that </v>

802
00:36:10.981 --> 00:36:13.170
<v Speaker 1>name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeshua was not that unusual name.</v>

803
00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:16.670
<v Speaker 1>Probably did a lot of the stuff he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is itinerant preacher and so on,</v>

804
00:36:16.690 --> 00:36:18.750
<v Speaker 1>so I'm on board with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not part of the group.</v>

805
00:36:18.751 --> 00:36:21.450
<v Speaker 1>The atheists say he never even existed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely made up story.</v>

806
00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:23.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

807
00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:24.063
<v Speaker 1>and I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the heavens and earth I conclude </v>

808
00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:26.933
<v Speaker 1>probably erroneously are in the minority</v>
<v Speaker 1>position that when he said the kingdom </v>

809
00:36:30.751 --> 00:36:35.680
<v Speaker 1>is within or in more famous passage that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm there,</v>

810
00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:36.653
<v Speaker 1>my disciples standing here now will not </v>
<v Speaker 1>die before they see the son of man </v>

811
00:36:40.111 --> 00:36:42.750
<v Speaker 1>return and these kinds of things in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gospels.</v>

812
00:36:42.751 --> 00:36:47.160
<v Speaker 1>I think his message was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no place that you're going to,</v>

813
00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:49.650
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after you died that heaven is here,</v>

814
00:36:49.890 --> 00:36:52.050
<v Speaker 1>this is it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to make the most of it.</v>

815
00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:53.303
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a message that you would give to </v>

816
00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:57.270
<v Speaker 1>people that are suppressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oppressed by the Romans.</v>

817
00:36:57.690 --> 00:37:00.390
<v Speaker 1>So I call this the oppression redemption</v>
<v Speaker 1>myth.</v>

818
00:37:00.391 --> 00:37:00.890
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

819
00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:01.723
<v Speaker 1>that it's a story of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of like the native American ghost dance </v>

820
00:37:04.861 --> 00:37:05.910
<v Speaker 1>in 1890.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

821
00:37:05.911 --> 00:37:06.744
<v Speaker 1>when they're like an oppressed people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're about to be wiped out in a </v>

822
00:37:09.751 --> 00:37:10.260
<v Speaker 1>messiah.</v>

823
00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:11.900
<v Speaker 1>Comes and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

824
00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:13.290
<v Speaker 1>it's all going to be great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

825
00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:15.900
<v Speaker 1>we're going to change everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The buffalo are coming back.</v>

826
00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:16.973
<v Speaker 1>If you wear this sweater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll be impervious to white man's </v>

827
00:37:19.951 --> 00:37:23.400
<v Speaker 1>bullets and it was a very Christ like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

828
00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:24.310
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

829
00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:25.770
<v Speaker 1>and when you start looking at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see,</v>

830
00:37:25.771 --> 00:37:26.080
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

831
00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:29.760
<v Speaker 1>this story that comes up a lot in </v>
<v Speaker 1>history among oppressed peoples as a way</v>

832
00:37:29.761 --> 00:37:30.594
<v Speaker 1>of saying we got to circle the wagons </v>
<v Speaker 1>and take care of our own against these </v>

833
00:37:33.211 --> 00:37:36.350
<v Speaker 1>oppressors and make a better life here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

834
00:37:36.351 --> 00:37:37.184
<v Speaker 1>It just makes sense that there'd be so </v>
<v Speaker 1>many parallels and you think about </v>

835
00:37:39.271 --> 00:37:43.140
<v Speaker 1>history and how many people were in pr,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oppressed and how often these narratives</v>

836
00:37:43.141 --> 00:37:43.974
<v Speaker 1>repeated themselves over and over again </v>
<v Speaker 1>when people got into power and then </v>

837
00:37:47.011 --> 00:37:49.230
<v Speaker 1>invaded others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yeah,</v>

838
00:37:49.231 --> 00:37:50.490
<v Speaker 1>it's brutal history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just,</v>

839
00:37:50.491 --> 00:37:53.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm just reading a Neil Ferguson's new </v>
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>

840
00:37:53.671 --> 00:37:55.830
<v Speaker 1>the tower and the square.</v>

841
00:37:55.830 --> 00:37:56.663
<v Speaker 1>It's about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tension throughout all of human </v>

842
00:37:58.711 --> 00:38:02.250
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization between hierarchical,</v>

843
00:38:02.251 --> 00:38:03.084
<v Speaker 1>top down power structures and horizontal</v>
<v Speaker 1>network power structures and that </v>

844
00:38:07.621 --> 00:38:11.100
<v Speaker 1>they're always intention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but mostly throughout history.</v>

845
00:38:11.101 --> 00:38:12.880
<v Speaker 1>It's the top down power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoever's.</v>

846
00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:16.620
<v Speaker 1>And so his is one chapter opens with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that scene from the good,</v>

847
00:38:16.621 --> 00:38:17.640
<v Speaker 1>the bad and the ugly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>

848
00:38:18.010 --> 00:38:18.843
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Eli Wallach and cleanness twitter </v>

849
00:38:20.911 --> 00:38:24.540
<v Speaker 1>facing off each other in the cemetery </v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

850
00:38:24.541 --> 00:38:27.360
<v Speaker 1>and cleanness which shoots the other guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>that really the bad guy.</v>

851
00:38:27.810 --> 00:38:28.643
<v Speaker 1>And then Eli Wallach tries to shoot his </v>
<v Speaker 1>gun and it's empty and so cleanness </v>

852
00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:32.953
<v Speaker 1>would walk over to him and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are two kinds of men in this </v>

853
00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:37.390
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those who have loaded revolvers.</v>

854
00:38:37.450 --> 00:38:40.060
<v Speaker 1>And those who dig your going to dig.</v>

855
00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:45.460
<v Speaker 1>Ferguson uses this star to say basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the history of civilization.</v>

856
00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:48.850
<v Speaker 1>Somebody who's got the loaded gun and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone else is going to dig.</v>

857
00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:52.840
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing that we made it this far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we live in such.</v>

858
00:38:53.110 --> 00:38:56.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean I know that there's troubles </v>
<v Speaker 1>today and I know we have issues in our,</v>

859
00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:59.500
<v Speaker 1>in our own society and forget about </v>
<v Speaker 1>other parts of the world,</v>

860
00:38:59.501 --> 00:39:01.750
<v Speaker 1>which there's horrific things happening </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>

861
00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:06.010
<v Speaker 1>but in comparison to just a few thousand</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

862
00:39:06.011 --> 00:39:08.560
<v Speaker 1>you would not want to live back there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be fun to go to visit.</v>

863
00:39:08.561 --> 00:39:09.394
<v Speaker 1>If you come back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would want to go into a giant </v>

864
00:39:11.201 --> 00:39:12.034
<v Speaker 1>bulletproof hamster bubble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like one of those roller and just like </v>

865
00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:19.080
<v Speaker 1>maybe where they couldn't see you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to be there.</v>

866
00:39:19.170 --> 00:39:20.110
<v Speaker 1>They can't see me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just.</v>

867
00:39:20.290 --> 00:39:21.123
<v Speaker 1>I would love to observe and see what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because we have all these like I'm </v>

868
00:39:23.981 --> 00:39:25.910
<v Speaker 1>watching this show Vikings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

869
00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:27.940
<v Speaker 1>And Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it pissed me off.</v>

870
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:28.833
<v Speaker 1>Episode two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy puts his feet up on the table </v>

871
00:39:30.521 --> 00:39:33.430
<v Speaker 1>and he's got rubber bottom soles of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoe.</v>

872
00:39:33.431 --> 00:39:34.264
<v Speaker 1>My Cue motherfuckers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has a heel that's clearly made in a </v>

873
00:39:37.091 --> 00:39:42.070
<v Speaker 1>factory and there's like this textured </v>
<v Speaker 1>plastic bottom to his shoe.</v>

874
00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:44.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did no one catch this?</v>

875
00:39:44.231 --> 00:39:45.064
<v Speaker 1>You guys have this amazing wardrobe and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all these ships and I'll take a picture </v>

876
00:39:48.821 --> 00:39:51.250
<v Speaker 1>of it now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll put it up on my instagram later was</v>

877
00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:52.810
<v Speaker 1>so dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It made me angry,</v>

878
00:39:53.110 --> 00:39:57.160
<v Speaker 1>but I'm watching this and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do we know this was how they talked?</v>

879
00:39:57.161 --> 00:39:59.500
<v Speaker 1>How do we know this is what they did?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do we.</v>

880
00:39:59.650 --> 00:40:00.483
<v Speaker 1>This is some weird interpretation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>some historical events really are to </v>

881
00:40:05.561 --> 00:40:07.780
<v Speaker 1>interpret and of course thoughts don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>fossilize.</v>

882
00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:10.790
<v Speaker 1>So I started early in the book about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

883
00:40:10.810 --> 00:40:11.643
<v Speaker 1>who were the first people to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to die and become aware of </v>

884
00:40:14.591 --> 00:40:16.440
<v Speaker 1>our own mortality in a way that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

885
00:40:16.450 --> 00:40:19.330
<v Speaker 1>maybe I can conceive of being somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

886
00:40:19.330 --> 00:40:21.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't actually die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we,</v>

887
00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:21.990
<v Speaker 1>we know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

888
00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:22.823
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an elephant's grieve and mammals grieve </v>

889
00:40:24.791 --> 00:40:26.800
<v Speaker 1>and Cetaceans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dolphins,</v>

890
00:40:26.801 --> 00:40:27.760
<v Speaker 1>whales,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so on.</v>

891
00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:29.040
<v Speaker 1>And chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

892
00:40:29.041 --> 00:40:29.874
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they feel these mothers are just </v>

893
00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:34.060
<v Speaker 1>depressed and suicidal when they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>infants die.</v>

894
00:40:34.570 --> 00:40:36.790
<v Speaker 1>But that's different from conceiving of </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

895
00:40:36.791 --> 00:40:37.624
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm going to die because I see </v>

896
00:40:39.071 --> 00:40:43.330
<v Speaker 1>people around me that I could conceive </v>
<v Speaker 1>of maybe some other place to go.</v>

897
00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:44.553
<v Speaker 1>So I start off with something of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>paradox that if I asked you to imagine </v>

898
00:40:47.651 --> 00:40:48.484
<v Speaker 1>yourself dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't do it because to imagine </v>

899
00:40:50.261 --> 00:40:51.580
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be alive.</v>

900
00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:52.953
<v Speaker 1>So it's not going to be like falling </v>
<v Speaker 1>asleep and waking up the next morning </v>

901
00:40:55.481 --> 00:40:56.314
<v Speaker 1>because you have dreams or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be more like general </v>

902
00:40:58.331 --> 00:40:59.740
<v Speaker 1>anesthesia where it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

903
00:40:59.741 --> 00:41:00.520
<v Speaker 1>10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>

904
00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:01.211
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>

905
00:41:01.211 --> 00:41:04.180
<v Speaker 1>boom lights out and you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you just never wake up.</v>

906
00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:05.510
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we,</v>

907
00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:09.970
<v Speaker 1>we talk about things like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there's nothing after death but,</v>

908
00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.520
<v Speaker 1>but even the word no thing implies </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a thing or you know,</v>

909
00:41:13.521 --> 00:41:15.250
<v Speaker 1>you're going to this place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this another,</v>

910
00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:18.960
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no thing or nowhere.</v>

911
00:41:19.170 --> 00:41:21.490
<v Speaker 1>It implies that there is aware that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to,</v>

912
00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:24.340
<v Speaker 1>but there's not even aware that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not going to.</v>

913
00:41:24.341 --> 00:41:25.630
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

914
00:41:25.631 --> 00:41:27.790
<v Speaker 1>with Lawrence Krauss and some of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>cosmologists,</v>

915
00:41:27.791 --> 00:41:30.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was there before the big bang.</v>

916
00:41:30.371 --> 00:41:32.110
<v Speaker 1>So when you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well imagine the universe,</v>

917
00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:34.310
<v Speaker 1>stars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>planets or galaxies,</v>

918
00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:37.370
<v Speaker 1>no light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's not even any space or time.</v>

919
00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:39.830
<v Speaker 1>And at some point you just don't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>the words,</v>

920
00:41:39.831 --> 00:41:41.990
<v Speaker 1>Stephen's say what it is we're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about.</v>

921
00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:44.480
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing before the big bang.</v>

922
00:41:44.481 --> 00:41:46.340
<v Speaker 1>You can't even ask actually talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

923
00:41:47.090 --> 00:41:49.180
<v Speaker 1>Well don't they think now though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's in,</v>

924
00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:52.640
<v Speaker 1>it's entirely possible that the big bang</v>
<v Speaker 1>is like a cycle.</v>

925
00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:53.543
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I think it's something like that I </v>

926
00:41:54.951 --> 00:41:59.951
<v Speaker 1>think spans and contracts infinitely </v>
<v Speaker 1>forever that that's a preferable.</v>

927
00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:02.570
<v Speaker 1>Well again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to come up with some way to talk</v>

928
00:42:02.571 --> 00:42:03.404
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we also have this weird biological </v>

929
00:42:05.810 --> 00:42:06.643
<v Speaker 1>idea based on our own limitations that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a birth and a death of </v>

930
00:42:09.561 --> 00:42:10.790
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

931
00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:11.653
<v Speaker 1>So actually have a chapter devoted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Deepak Chopra and the eastern wisdom </v>

932
00:42:13.941 --> 00:42:18.920
<v Speaker 1>traditions were kind of buddies now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yeah,</v>

933
00:42:18.921 --> 00:42:19.754
<v Speaker 1>I went to his center down in Carlsbad </v>
<v Speaker 1>and spend some time there and I think </v>

934
00:42:22.551 --> 00:42:23.930
<v Speaker 1>he's all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a good guy.</v>

935
00:42:23.931 --> 00:42:25.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now he's totally a good guy.</v>

936
00:42:25.210 --> 00:42:26.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

937
00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:29.510
<v Speaker 1>he's been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at times in the past,</v>

938
00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:33.220
<v Speaker 1>either misleading or misled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

939
00:42:33.221 --> 00:42:34.810
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

940
00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:35.743
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of his recommendations for dietary </v>

941
00:42:37.161 --> 00:42:37.994
<v Speaker 1>things or whatever perhaps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I know for sure because I've gotten </v>

942
00:42:40.671 --> 00:42:42.890
<v Speaker 1>to know him pretty well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he totally believes this stuff.</v>

943
00:42:42.890 --> 00:42:44.300
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

944
00:42:44.301 --> 00:42:47.830
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like woo as I used to call it </v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

945
00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:48.733
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you interpret it from a kind of a </v>

946
00:42:50.361 --> 00:42:51.350
<v Speaker 1>Buddhist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>western,</v>

947
00:42:51.351 --> 00:42:54.960
<v Speaker 1>Buddhist position know when he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

948
00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:55.833
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness is the ground of all </v>

949
00:42:56.841 --> 00:42:59.690
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the ontological primitive.</v>

950
00:42:59.691 --> 00:43:04.560
<v Speaker 1>These things that sound nonsensical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you think about it sort of a,</v>

951
00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:08.810
<v Speaker 1>from a simple perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the entire universe is in your brain and</v>

952
00:43:08.811 --> 00:43:12.230
<v Speaker 1>when you cease to exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the university says to exist for you,</v>

953
00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:13.453
<v Speaker 1>but you're in your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I call it the week consciousness </v>

954
00:43:16.251 --> 00:43:18.350
<v Speaker 1>principle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of true by definition.</v>

955
00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:20.480
<v Speaker 1>Now he goes a little bit further and </v>
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

956
00:43:20.481 --> 00:43:21.314
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that consciousness is everything and </v>

957
00:43:22.191 --> 00:43:27.170
<v Speaker 1>that we bring into existence material </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff by thinking about her observing it</v>

958
00:43:27.171 --> 00:43:28.004
<v Speaker 1>or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here's some quantum physics </v>

959
00:43:28.701 --> 00:43:31.040
<v Speaker 1>experiments that are really spooky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

960
00:43:31.041 --> 00:43:31.750
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>time out.</v>

961
00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:34.070
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quantum physics is weird and spooky.</v>

962
00:43:34.071 --> 00:43:36.800
<v Speaker 1>Consciousness is weird and spooky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean they're connected.</v>

963
00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:39.050
<v Speaker 1>He thinks they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a debatable point.</v>

964
00:43:39.051 --> 00:43:40.140
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

965
00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:41.870
<v Speaker 1>but still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

966
00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:42.913
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the experience of going in and so I did </v>

967
00:43:45.801 --> 00:43:46.634
<v Speaker 1>the meditation thing and all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>massages and the teas and the food and </v>

968
00:43:49.971 --> 00:43:50.870
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

969
00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:52.790
<v Speaker 1>it's this beach side resort in Carl's </v>
<v Speaker 1>bed.</v>

970
00:43:52.850 --> 00:43:55.160
<v Speaker 1>You can't help but feeling better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

971
00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:56.270
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this stuff works.</v>

972
00:43:56.460 --> 00:43:58.730
<v Speaker 1>Whereas Carlsbad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's down by Encinitas.</v>

973
00:43:58.731 --> 00:44:01.940
<v Speaker 1>North of San Diego has a beautiful area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally beautiful.</v>

974
00:44:01.941 --> 00:44:03.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's Kinda deep box.</v>

975
00:44:03.151 --> 00:44:06.590
<v Speaker 1>Not done yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got a good thing going and not just</v>

976
00:44:06.591 --> 00:44:07.161
<v Speaker 1>the bucket,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

977
00:44:07.161 --> 00:44:10.610
<v Speaker 1>there's other people like Sam Harris at </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bob Wright has a new book out called why</v>

978
00:44:10.611 --> 00:44:13.430
<v Speaker 1>Buddhism is true and okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it works.</v>

979
00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:16.070
<v Speaker 1>So we're back to does it work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean by does it work?</v>

980
00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:19.670
<v Speaker 1>Not just for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had an experience and I felt better.</v>

981
00:44:20.090 --> 00:44:21.590
<v Speaker 1>We've got to do better than that for </v>
<v Speaker 1>science.</v>

982
00:44:21.591 --> 00:44:22.424
<v Speaker 1>So what Deepak and a brighter talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about is that is that the Western </v>

983
00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:29.060
<v Speaker 1>version of Buddhism may actually work </v>
<v Speaker 1>medically.</v>

984
00:44:29.061 --> 00:44:31.720
<v Speaker 1>It may lower stress hormones in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>body,</v>

985
00:44:31.721 --> 00:44:32.160
<v Speaker 1>but a lower</v>

986
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:32.993
<v Speaker 2>blood pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These kinds of things that are </v>

987
00:44:34.051 --> 00:44:34.884
<v Speaker 2>measurable because that's what we want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to know from a western scientific </v>

988
00:44:36.811 --> 00:44:38.730
<v Speaker 2>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not just do I feel better,</v>

989
00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:42.480
<v Speaker 2>but 67 percent of the people who did </v>
<v Speaker 2>this particular treatment,</v>

990
00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:45.420
<v Speaker 2>they got better by these measurable </v>
<v Speaker 2>criteria.</v>

991
00:44:45.690 --> 00:44:46.500
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>

992
00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:50.190
<v Speaker 2>That seems fair enough to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm open to that now.</v>

993
00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:55.050
<v Speaker 2>This idea that there's nothing or no </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that we can't even.</v>

994
00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:55.913
<v Speaker 2>We can't even wrap our head around </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing because we would think of a </v>

995
00:44:59.701 --> 00:45:02.850
<v Speaker 2>thing that there's no thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's never a thing.</v>

996
00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:03.773
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

997
00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:08.880
<v Speaker 2>But how do we or why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't we just say we don't know.</v>

998
00:45:09.690 --> 00:45:10.523
<v Speaker 2>Why don't we speculate on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibility of consciousness being some </v>

999
00:45:15.301 --> 00:45:20.301
<v Speaker 2>sort of ethereal thing or something that</v>
<v Speaker 2>exists outside of the Bible?</v>

1000
00:45:21.211 --> 00:45:22.650
<v Speaker 2>We don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We really don't.</v>

1001
00:45:22.651 --> 00:45:23.510
<v Speaker 2>That's what I say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1002
00:45:23.511 --> 00:45:24.344
<v Speaker 2>I conclude and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if there's an afterlife or </v>

1003
00:45:27.151 --> 00:45:29.100
<v Speaker 2>not at very end of the book.</v>

1004
00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:29.933
<v Speaker 2>We can come back to this later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just say it doesn't really matter </v>

1005
00:45:31.531 --> 00:45:34.080
<v Speaker 2>whether there's an afterlife or not </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we don't live in the afterlife.</v>

1006
00:45:34.110 --> 00:45:34.943
<v Speaker 2>We live in this one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is the time you got to do </v>

1007
00:45:36.661 --> 00:45:37.494
<v Speaker 2>whatever you gotta do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I call this elvis error a lob is lv </v>

1008
00:45:41.131 --> 00:45:42.990
<v Speaker 2>singer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Woody Allen's character in Annie Hall.</v>

1009
00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:44.133
<v Speaker 2>I remember the scene early in the movie </v>
<v Speaker 2>where he has a flashback as a young boy </v>

1010
00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:49.500
<v Speaker 2>and his.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's in the psychiatrist office with his</v>

1011
00:45:49.501 --> 00:45:50.940
<v Speaker 2>mom and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the problem?</v>

1012
00:45:50.941 --> 00:45:52.860
<v Speaker 2>He won't do his homework.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't do your homework.</v>

1013
00:45:53.310 --> 00:45:54.570
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you do your homework,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alvin?</v>

1014
00:45:54.571 --> 00:45:58.310
<v Speaker 2>He says the universe is expanding and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>says the universe is expanding,</v>

1015
00:45:58.311 --> 00:45:59.940
<v Speaker 2>goes to the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is everything there is,</v>

1016
00:45:59.941 --> 00:46:02.190
<v Speaker 2>and if it's expanding one day it's all </v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna blow apart,</v>

1017
00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:04.890
<v Speaker 2>so nothing really matters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to do my homework,</v>

1018
00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:07.080
<v Speaker 2>and his father yells at him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the universe?</v>

1019
00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:08.820
<v Speaker 2>Got To do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We live in Brooklyn.</v>

1020
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:13.280
<v Speaker 2>Brooklyn is not expanding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's my sort of take home message.</v>

1021
00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:17.760
<v Speaker 2>We don't live in the afterlife or before</v>
<v Speaker 2>the universe or after the.</v>

1022
00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:20.240
<v Speaker 2>None of that matters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's interesting to talk about,</v>

1023
00:46:20.250 --> 00:46:23.790
<v Speaker 2>but we live in this life so this is what</v>
<v Speaker 2>really counts.</v>

1024
00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:25.770
<v Speaker 2>They're fascinating things to </v>
<v Speaker 2>contemplate,</v>

1025
00:46:25.890 --> 00:46:29.100
<v Speaker 2>but ultimately you really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for practicality sake,</v>

1026
00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:31.350
<v Speaker 2>you really should be paying attention to</v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

1027
00:46:31.650 --> 00:46:32.520
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1028
00:46:32.521 --> 00:46:34.310
<v Speaker 2>this is what I tell deep buck all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time when he says he bought,</v>

1029
00:46:34.311 --> 00:46:35.144
<v Speaker 2>you know Michael,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this table is actually made of atoms </v>

1030
00:46:36.361 --> 00:46:39.120
<v Speaker 2>that are mostly empty space and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>quantum physicists,</v>

1031
00:46:39.150 --> 00:46:41.580
<v Speaker 2>but according to Sean Carroll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not correct over there,</v>

1032
00:46:41.581 --> 00:46:42.391
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1033
00:46:42.391 --> 00:46:45.420
<v Speaker 2>He explained that this idea of empty </v>
<v Speaker 2>space.</v>

1034
00:46:45.421 --> 00:46:46.260
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1035
00:46:46.261 --> 00:46:47.094
<v Speaker 2>that's just a poor way of describing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would defer to him and let him </v>

1036
00:46:50.761 --> 00:46:51.594
<v Speaker 2>describe it.</v>

1037
00:46:51.630 --> 00:46:55.650
<v Speaker 2>He also described the superpositions </v>
<v Speaker 2>particles,</v>

1038
00:46:55.651 --> 00:46:56.484
<v Speaker 2>subatomic particles being in super </v>
<v Speaker 2>position where they're in a state of </v>

1039
00:46:58.651 --> 00:46:59.484
<v Speaker 2>moving and not moving at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He explained that in a way that </v>

1040
00:47:02.491 --> 00:47:05.250
<v Speaker 2>completely fucked my head up too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1041
00:47:05.251 --> 00:47:07.410
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought I had figured out sort of.</v>

1042
00:47:07.820 --> 00:47:08.680
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

1043
00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:12.810
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think I had to figure it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I thought I had a definition that at</v>

1044
00:47:12.811 --> 00:47:14.550
<v Speaker 2>least was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1045
00:47:14.551 --> 00:47:16.590
<v Speaker 2>well it's this even though I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand,</v>

1046
00:47:16.591 --> 00:47:17.101
<v Speaker 2>and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1047
00:47:17.101 --> 00:47:18.540
<v Speaker 2>it's not even that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1048
00:47:18.620 --> 00:47:19.453
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I refer to be pleased if you're </v>

1049
00:47:21.091 --> 00:47:23.190
<v Speaker 2>interested,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to this Sean Carroll podcast,</v>

1050
00:47:23.570 --> 00:47:24.403
<v Speaker 2>as I understand it anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it doesn't really matter because </v>

1051
00:47:26.131 --> 00:47:28.170
<v Speaker 2>the atoms are jiggling in a way that </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is solid.</v>

1052
00:47:28.171 --> 00:47:29.980
<v Speaker 2>You could tell it solid and this is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>level</v>

1053
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:32.140
<v Speaker 1>we live at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So many drops on your head.</v>

1054
00:47:32.141 --> 00:47:32.951
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in trouble.</v>

1055
00:47:32.951 --> 00:47:33.581
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1056
00:47:33.581 --> 00:47:35.710
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't live in a quantum world.</v>

1057
00:47:35.711 --> 00:47:38.110
<v Speaker 1>We live in a macro world where this kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of stuff does matter.</v>

1058
00:47:38.111 --> 00:47:38.944
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1059
00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:40.140
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1060
00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:40.993
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for Deepak the whole Western way of </v>

1061
00:47:42.761 --> 00:47:45.320
<v Speaker 1>thinking scientifically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a beginning and an end time is a</v>

1062
00:47:45.321 --> 00:47:48.850
<v Speaker 1>linear thing that we could measure and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's birth and death,</v>

1063
00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:51.130
<v Speaker 1>all that is the wrong way to think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1064
00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:53.800
<v Speaker 1>That the Buddhist way is that it's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>all consciousness.</v>

1065
00:47:53.801 --> 00:47:54.634
<v Speaker 1>And when you die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you returned to the conscious state you </v>

1066
00:47:55.631 --> 00:47:57.610
<v Speaker 1>were before you were in before you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>born.</v>

1067
00:47:58.060 --> 00:47:58.893
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the physical body is just an </v>

1068
00:48:00.011 --> 00:48:03.100
<v Speaker 1>instantiation of this conscious thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever this is.</v>

1069
00:48:03.101 --> 00:48:04.210
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1070
00:48:04.250 --> 00:48:04.760
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1071
00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:05.593
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1072
00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:06.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1073
00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:08.920
<v Speaker 1>I'd be surprised,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll be pleasantly surprised.</v>

1074
00:48:09.010 --> 00:48:12.850
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you that if it turns out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>know close my eyes for the last time and</v>

1075
00:48:12.851 --> 00:48:13.631
<v Speaker 1>I wake up and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1076
00:48:13.631 --> 00:48:14.740
<v Speaker 1>there's deep pockets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1077
00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:17.860
<v Speaker 1>whoever my friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carl Sagan and Stephen Jay Gould and all</v>

1078
00:48:17.861 --> 00:48:19.150
<v Speaker 1>the greats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Asimov are there.</v>

1079
00:48:19.150 --> 00:48:20.950
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hitches there,</v>

1080
00:48:20.951 --> 00:48:21.521
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1081
00:48:21.521 --> 00:48:22.690
<v Speaker 1>oh boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1082
00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:24.010
<v Speaker 1>this isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't hell.</v>

1083
00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:25.480
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's true,</v>

1084
00:48:25.481 --> 00:48:26.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not against any of this.</v>

1085
00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:27.573
<v Speaker 1>Just like I'm not against Ray Kurzweil </v>
<v Speaker 1>in these guys figuring out that we can </v>

1086
00:48:30.731 --> 00:48:32.830
<v Speaker 1>live 200 years or 300 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

1087
00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:34.050
<v Speaker 1>If you can do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1088
00:48:34.090 --> 00:48:35.680
<v Speaker 1>but let's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1089
00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:37.330
<v Speaker 1>so when they say to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sherman,</v>

1090
00:48:37.331 --> 00:48:38.164
<v Speaker 1>don't you want to live to be $500,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like just get me to 80 without </v>

1091
00:48:41.170 --> 00:48:43.780
<v Speaker 1>prostate cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give me the 90 without Alzheimer's,</v>

1092
00:48:43.781 --> 00:48:45.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 to 100.</v>

1093
00:48:45.701 --> 00:48:47.840
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not on a morphine drip in a bed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1094
00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:51.070
<v Speaker 1>just quality of life incrementally year </v>
<v Speaker 1>by year.</v>

1095
00:48:51.430 --> 00:48:54.550
<v Speaker 1>And if it turns out you solve these </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems and we lived $150,</v>

1096
00:48:54.670 --> 00:48:55.503
<v Speaker 1>$200,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we have a bunch of other problems </v>

1097
00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:57.820
<v Speaker 1>we don't even know about yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1098
00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:02.470
<v Speaker 1>Well I think there's some beauty in </v>
<v Speaker 1>temporary things that we,</v>

1099
00:49:02.471 --> 00:49:07.150
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're avoiding that concept.</v>

1100
00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:08.013
<v Speaker 1>We were terrified of things ending and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's beauty and things being </v>

1101
00:49:11.621 --> 00:49:12.710
<v Speaker 1>temporary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1102
00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:15.010
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to go to see a movie </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's 100 hours long.</v>

1103
00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:19.290
<v Speaker 1>That's a movie's a great movement is 90 </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes you're in your app,</v>

1104
00:49:19.291 --> 00:49:21.100
<v Speaker 1>maybe two hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's three hours,</v>

1105
00:49:21.101 --> 00:49:21.934
<v Speaker 1>if it's blade runner or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something crazy like Christopher </v>

1106
00:49:24.461 --> 00:49:26.380
<v Speaker 1>hitchens in my book is I love his </v>
<v Speaker 1>analogy.</v>

1107
00:49:26.381 --> 00:49:27.214
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're at the party and death taps you </v>

1108
00:49:28.571 --> 00:49:29.404
<v Speaker 1>on the shoulder says you have to leave </v>
<v Speaker 1>and worse the party is going to go on </v>

1109
00:49:32.110 --> 00:49:33.670
<v Speaker 1>without you and they're going to all </v>
<v Speaker 1>have fun.</v>

1110
00:49:33.671 --> 00:49:34.504
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

1111
00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:38.170
<v Speaker 1>but if the Christian version of of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Heaven and Hell is real,</v>

1112
00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:39.393
<v Speaker 1>you're tap on their shoulder at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>party until you can never leave the </v>

1113
00:49:41.441 --> 00:49:42.160
<v Speaker 1>party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1114
00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:43.450
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's even worse.</v>

1115
00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:45.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do anything forever.</v>

1116
00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:46.773
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and imagine the classical version of </v>

1117
00:49:49.330 --> 00:49:50.163
<v Speaker 1>what heaven is like a guy with a harp </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a bunch of babies with </v>

1118
00:49:55.001 --> 00:49:57.190
<v Speaker 1>wings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what are even that aside,</v>

1119
00:49:57.900 --> 00:50:00.760
<v Speaker 1>this way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hitch called it a celestial North Korea.</v>

1120
00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:01.653
<v Speaker 1>You have a dictator that knows all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your thoughts and everything you're </v>

1121
00:50:04.601 --> 00:50:05.240
<v Speaker 1>going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1122
00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:08.140
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute that that does not sound </v>
<v Speaker 1>like fun to me.</v>

1123
00:50:08.170 --> 00:50:10.540
<v Speaker 1>That seems to me to be the inevitable </v>
<v Speaker 1>future though.</v>

1124
00:50:10.541 --> 00:50:11.374
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things that I'm really</v>
<v Speaker 1>nervous about the dystopian version of </v>

1125
00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:16.593
<v Speaker 1>technological interference in our lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm an entirely convinced that we're </v>

1126
00:50:20.381 --> 00:50:23.320
<v Speaker 1>going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in inside of 100 years,</v>

1127
00:50:23.590 --> 00:50:24.423
<v Speaker 1>live in a world where all of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts really are documented and </v>

1128
00:50:27.771 --> 00:50:28.090
<v Speaker 1>there's</v>

1129
00:50:28.090 --> 00:50:30.830
<v Speaker 2>there's they have access to them the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same way.</v>

1130
00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:35.790
<v Speaker 2>No one in their wildest dreams conceived</v>
<v Speaker 2>to photographs for hundred years ago.</v>

1131
00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:36.993
<v Speaker 2>In 400 years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to have the ability to </v>

1132
00:50:38.871 --> 00:50:39.704
<v Speaker 2>record record thoughts and ideas and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to be able to read the </v>

1133
00:50:42.111 --> 00:50:42.944
<v Speaker 2>contents of each other's minds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That could be well maybe that maybe we </v>

1134
00:50:47.061 --> 00:50:47.894
<v Speaker 2>need some regulation there for that </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe or maybe we just have to accept </v>

1135
00:50:50.661 --> 00:50:51.494
<v Speaker 2>the fact that most of what goes wrong in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world goes wrong because people can </v>

1136
00:50:56.660 --> 00:50:58.490
<v Speaker 2>think the secret,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sneaky,</v>

1137
00:50:58.491 --> 00:51:02.650
<v Speaker 2>fucked up thoughts and when those no </v>
<v Speaker 2>longer exist anymore,</v>

1138
00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:06.680
<v Speaker 2>maybe it will clean out human behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was an at our limits episode about</v>

1139
00:51:06.681 --> 00:51:07.514
<v Speaker 2>that in the 19 fifties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might've been the other one pilot </v>

1140
00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:10.793
<v Speaker 2>tell twilight zone where this guy all of</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sudden is able to read the minds of </v>

1141
00:51:16.251 --> 00:51:20.030
<v Speaker 2>other people and he's at work and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>listening to all these conversations and</v>

1142
00:51:20.031 --> 00:51:21.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this fun stuff.</v>

1143
00:51:21.530 --> 00:51:24.560
<v Speaker 2>But then this one guy who's really dark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he's gonna,</v>

1144
00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:29.680
<v Speaker 2>he's gonna come in and blow everybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>away and sort of climax is where he,</v>

1145
00:51:29.781 --> 00:51:30.614
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he comes in and tells the boss and </v>

1146
00:51:31.361 --> 00:51:32.620
<v Speaker 2>everybody in it and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1147
00:51:32.621 --> 00:51:34.720
<v Speaker 2>they go in there and it turns out the </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy says,</v>

1148
00:51:34.770 --> 00:51:36.110
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was never going to do that.</v>

1149
00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:37.970
<v Speaker 2>I was just angry and I was just thinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1150
00:51:38.810 --> 00:51:40.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's like a minority report thing,</v>

1151
00:51:40.581 --> 00:51:42.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could have these thoughts.</v>

1152
00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:46.130
<v Speaker 2>We know from research that this is David</v>
<v Speaker 2>buses research on.</v>

1153
00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:49.010
<v Speaker 2>He wrote a book on murders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the murder next door it's called.</v>

1154
00:51:49.490 --> 00:51:52.430
<v Speaker 2>And so he did the research on asking </v>
<v Speaker 2>subjects.</v>

1155
00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:55.520
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever thought about killing </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody you didn't like?</v>

1156
00:51:56.290 --> 00:51:57.123
<v Speaker 2>It turns out like 80 percent of guys and</v>
<v Speaker 2>67 percent of women have had homicidal </v>

1157
00:52:00.861 --> 00:52:01.880
<v Speaker 2>fantasies in their life.</v>

1158
00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:06.260
<v Speaker 2>Now 90 nine point nine percent of us </v>
<v Speaker 2>never act on her homicidal fantasies,</v>

1159
00:52:06.261 --> 00:52:07.094
<v Speaker 2>but we get mad at us if we can imagine </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's got the narrative accounts </v>

1160
00:52:09.261 --> 00:52:12.560
<v Speaker 2>because he also asked him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell me what you would do and Oh my God,</v>

1161
00:52:12.561 --> 00:52:13.394
<v Speaker 2>they're just incredible to read.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I would break every bone in his </v>

1162
00:52:15.771 --> 00:52:16.604
<v Speaker 2>body and then I would pull out his </v>
<v Speaker 2>fingernails and then I would just say </v>

1163
00:52:19.881 --> 00:52:20.810
<v Speaker 2>they go onto your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

1164
00:52:20.811 --> 00:52:24.080
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's just fantasy.</v>

1165
00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:24.820
<v Speaker 2>Fantasy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1166
00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:25.653
<v Speaker 2>Some people have suicidal fantasies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's people that have fantasies of </v>

1167
00:52:28.341 --> 00:52:30.630
<v Speaker 2>jumping off of a giant building.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1168
00:52:30.631 --> 00:52:32.870
<v Speaker 2>You what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but most don't act on it.</v>

1169
00:52:32.871 --> 00:52:33.704
<v Speaker 2>Most don't act on it and there's people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that just have these thoughts and they </v>

1170
00:52:36.471 --> 00:52:38.260
<v Speaker 2>think I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They look at the edge and they go,</v>

1171
00:52:38.270 --> 00:52:40.700
<v Speaker 2>I could just jump off right now and and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this whole thing,</v>

1172
00:52:41.210 --> 00:52:43.610
<v Speaker 2>but I won't and shouldn't be punished </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

1173
00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:44.810
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course not.</v>

1174
00:52:45.180 --> 00:52:46.820
<v Speaker 2>The minority report scenario,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1175
00:52:46.821 --> 00:52:47.654
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we found out that this guy's thinking </v>

1176
00:52:48.771 --> 00:52:51.710
<v Speaker 2>about robbing the bank,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he had a fantasy about it.</v>

1177
00:52:51.711 --> 00:52:53.690
<v Speaker 2>He's going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've thought about doing that.</v>

1178
00:52:54.300 --> 00:52:55.610
<v Speaker 2>You have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not really,</v>

1179
00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:56.833
<v Speaker 2>but just really fleet and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would I do if I had to rob this </v>

1180
00:52:59.301 --> 00:52:59.781
<v Speaker 2>bank?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1181
00:52:59.781 --> 00:53:02.180
<v Speaker 2>I've never actually considered robbing a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bank,</v>

1182
00:53:02.181 --> 00:53:03.230
<v Speaker 2>but I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1183
00:53:03.231 --> 00:53:05.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm at the bank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What am I just decided to pull out a gun</v>

1184
00:53:05.391 --> 00:53:07.310
<v Speaker 2>and everybody gets the floor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where's the,</v>

1185
00:53:07.340 --> 00:53:09.530
<v Speaker 2>where's the cameras?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where's the security guard?</v>

1186
00:53:09.620 --> 00:53:11.930
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you've seen so many movies.</v>

1187
00:53:11.931 --> 00:53:13.880
<v Speaker 2>It's a if you're bored,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1188
00:53:13.881 --> 00:53:14.714
<v Speaker 2>but today that's another thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are rarely board because when </v>

1189
00:53:17.211 --> 00:53:18.450
<v Speaker 2>they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just pull out their phones,</v>

1190
00:53:18.490 --> 00:53:22.920
<v Speaker 2>stare at pictures of their butts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1191
00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:25.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just pull out facebook or instagram.</v>

1192
00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:26.080
<v Speaker 2>No longer board.</v>

1193
00:53:26.620 --> 00:53:29.170
<v Speaker 1>When I was in my religious phase and in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1194
00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:32.100
<v Speaker 1>in college I asked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was before I went to pepperdine,</v>

1195
00:53:32.101 --> 00:53:33.780
<v Speaker 1>which is a religious clothes at Glendale</v>
<v Speaker 1>College,</v>

1196
00:53:33.781 --> 00:53:34.614
<v Speaker 1>just to get my g out of the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my philosophy professor was an </v>

1197
00:53:37.411 --> 00:53:38.244
<v Speaker 1>atheist and I was an evangelical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm telling them about Jesus and the </v>

1198
00:53:40.651 --> 00:53:41.484
<v Speaker 1>whole thing and the after life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said he want to know are there </v>

1199
00:53:43.051 --> 00:53:44.910
<v Speaker 1>golf courses and tennis courts in </v>
<v Speaker 1>heaven?</v>

1200
00:53:45.250 --> 00:53:47.880
<v Speaker 1>Because I gotta have something to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be bored.</v>

1201
00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:52.780
<v Speaker 1>I thought I have no idea and need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1202
00:53:52.790 --> 00:53:54.340
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it'd be with cheese.</v>

1203
00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:55.800
<v Speaker 1>I want to play golf.</v>

1204
00:53:58.720 --> 00:53:59.553
<v Speaker 1>Then I also quote from Julia Sweeney is </v>
<v Speaker 1>letting go of God monologue that she </v>

1205
00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:03.950
<v Speaker 1>opens this monologue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1206
00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:08.180
<v Speaker 1>dealing with the Mormon boys coming by </v>
<v Speaker 1>or her house in,</v>

1207
00:54:08.181 --> 00:54:10.650
<v Speaker 1>in Hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're pitching their story like,</v>

1208
00:54:10.651 --> 00:54:12.150
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on in and pitch me your story.</v>

1209
00:54:12.151 --> 00:54:14.040
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a Hollywood movie script.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1210
00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:15.053
<v Speaker 1>what do you got?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they tell her the whole time it's </v>

1211
00:54:16.470 --> 00:54:17.251
<v Speaker 1>going to be great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1212
00:54:17.251 --> 00:54:20.220
<v Speaker 1>the blind shall see again that Jeff </v>
<v Speaker 1>Shell here again,</v>

1213
00:54:20.221 --> 00:54:22.890
<v Speaker 1>and your body will be whole again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so she says,</v>

1214
00:54:22.891 --> 00:54:24.870
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see.</v>

1215
00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:26.550
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had uterine cancer.</v>

1216
00:54:26.551 --> 00:54:27.384
<v Speaker 1>So I had my uterus taken out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do I get my uterus back when I go to </v>

1217
00:54:29.521 --> 00:54:30.091
<v Speaker 1>heaven?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>

1218
00:54:30.091 --> 00:54:30.901
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>

1219
00:54:30.901 --> 00:54:35.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't want it back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if you had a nose job and you liked</v>

1220
00:54:35.611 --> 00:54:37.890
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll have to get my old nose back.</v>

1221
00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:38.833
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

1222
00:54:38.980 --> 00:54:39.813
<v Speaker 1>I'd say openness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A little funny story because it gets to </v>

1223
00:54:42.721 --> 00:54:44.700
<v Speaker 1>the problem of identity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who are you?</v>

1224
00:54:45.180 --> 00:54:46.013
<v Speaker 1>So if you're resurrected with Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he early earlier Christian sex before </v>

1225
00:54:51.510 --> 00:54:55.380
<v Speaker 1>descartes introduced dualism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They believe that you are,</v>

1226
00:54:55.410 --> 00:54:56.870
<v Speaker 1>when you're resurrected at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1227
00:54:56.990 --> 00:54:57.823
<v Speaker 1>after your death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are physically there in heaven </v>

1228
00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:01.500
<v Speaker 1>physically and your soul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing.</v>

1229
00:55:01.530 --> 00:55:03.900
<v Speaker 1>It's just one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the question is,</v>

1230
00:55:03.901 --> 00:55:05.580
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how old are you when you're there?</v>

1231
00:55:05.740 --> 00:55:06.573
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're brought up and there you are </v>

1232
00:55:07.141 --> 00:55:09.070
<v Speaker 1>sitting next to Jesus and God and </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

1233
00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:10.261
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they.</v>

1234
00:55:10.261 --> 00:55:11.094
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30,</v>

1235
00:55:11.610 --> 00:55:13.550
<v Speaker 1>30 seems like a good year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a year.</v>

1236
00:55:13.620 --> 00:55:15.840
<v Speaker 1>Jesus was crucified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1237
00:55:15.841 --> 00:55:16.700
<v Speaker 1>Thirty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1238
00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:17.573
<v Speaker 1>but wait a minute and I'm 63 now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what happens is all the memories of </v>

1239
00:55:20.311 --> 00:55:22.620
<v Speaker 1>my life for the last 33 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

1240
00:55:22.621 --> 00:55:24.690
<v Speaker 1>you get all those memories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

1241
00:55:24.691 --> 00:55:25.524
<v Speaker 1>But the memory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the memory of my being 30 now is </v>

1242
00:55:27.961 --> 00:55:31.980
<v Speaker 1>different from the memory I had when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was 50 of being 30 and 40 being 30.</v>

1243
00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:34.500
<v Speaker 1>And even when I was in my thirties being</v>
<v Speaker 1>30,</v>

1244
00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:35.281
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1245
00:55:35.281 --> 00:55:37.410
<v Speaker 1>the memories are always changing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>edited in,</v>

1246
00:55:37.411 --> 00:55:38.244
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1247
00:55:38.620 --> 00:55:41.760
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and forgotten or modified if it,</v>

1248
00:55:41.790 --> 00:55:44.580
<v Speaker 1>particularly based on life experiences </v>
<v Speaker 1>that happened afterwards.</v>

1249
00:55:44.581 --> 00:55:46.290
<v Speaker 1>So in your twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go to this college,</v>

1250
00:55:46.291 --> 00:55:49.080
<v Speaker 1>he marry this person and you take this </v>
<v Speaker 1>job or whatever,</v>

1251
00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:50.213
<v Speaker 1>you don't really know what the Info,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the impact of those decisions are until </v>

1252
00:55:53.491 --> 00:55:54.324
<v Speaker 1>much later in life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why we think it's ridiculous </v>

1253
00:55:56.131 --> 00:55:56.964
<v Speaker 1>for people to write memoirs in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>twenties or thirties because they're </v>

1254
00:55:58.621 --> 00:55:59.454
<v Speaker 1>celebrities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have no idea what those things </v>

1255
00:56:01.411 --> 00:56:05.640
<v Speaker 1>actually mean until much later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is the problem of who you are.</v>

1256
00:56:05.641 --> 00:56:07.260
<v Speaker 1>So first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1257
00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:10.650
<v Speaker 1>we already know that none of your body </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the same material.</v>

1258
00:56:10.651 --> 00:56:11.700
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say a decade ago.</v>

1259
00:56:11.701 --> 00:56:15.150
<v Speaker 1>Your cells are all recycled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The molecules and atoms are gone.</v>

1260
00:56:15.540 --> 00:56:16.680
<v Speaker 1>There's new ones that replace it.</v>

1261
00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:17.513
<v Speaker 1>It's the pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the pattern of information that </v>

1262
00:56:18.931 --> 00:56:20.370
<v Speaker 1>represents you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan.</v>

1263
00:56:20.371 --> 00:56:22.230
<v Speaker 1>This is what you look like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are your memories.</v>

1264
00:56:22.710 --> 00:56:23.543
<v Speaker 1>So somehow that this has to be copied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in the Ray Kurzweil scenario of the </v>

1265
00:56:27.641 --> 00:56:29.560
<v Speaker 1>singularity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to upload the mind.</v>

1266
00:56:29.950 --> 00:56:33.670
<v Speaker 1>They're going to copy your connectome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all your memories in your synapses.</v>

1267
00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:35.560
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So right away there's the problem of,</v>

1268
00:56:35.561 --> 00:56:37.240
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which memories will all of them?</v>

1269
00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:38.133
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are no fixed set of memories that </v>

1270
00:56:39.371 --> 00:56:41.740
<v Speaker 1>are you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your memories are always changing.</v>

1271
00:56:41.741 --> 00:56:45.190
<v Speaker 1>So the moment you take a snapshot of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just a fixed point.</v>

1272
00:56:45.670 --> 00:56:49.600
<v Speaker 1>That's not you really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are this whole long continuum.</v>

1273
00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:50.913
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's always kind of flexible and </v>

1274
00:56:51.821 --> 00:56:53.200
<v Speaker 1>changing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's that.</v>

1275
00:56:54.070 --> 00:56:54.903
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the problem with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind uploading scenario is there's two </v>

1276
00:56:58.360 --> 00:56:59.193
<v Speaker 1>kinds of cells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the memory cells meme self of </v>

1277
00:57:01.481 --> 00:57:03.040
<v Speaker 1>all your memories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's the point of view,</v>

1278
00:57:03.041 --> 00:57:04.240
<v Speaker 1>self pov self.</v>

1279
00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:06.700
<v Speaker 1>So when you go to sleep tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wake up tomorrow,</v>

1280
00:57:06.701 --> 00:57:09.040
<v Speaker 1>you're still looking at the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>through your eyes,</v>

1281
00:57:09.041 --> 00:57:12.160
<v Speaker 1>and there's a continuity of point of </v>
<v Speaker 1>view from one day to the next.</v>

1282
00:57:12.220 --> 00:57:16.060
<v Speaker 1>Same thing with general anesthesia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like in the Johnny Depp movie,</v>

1283
00:57:16.061 --> 00:57:18.760
<v Speaker 1>Transcendence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where he is poisoned by these terrorists</v>

1284
00:57:18.761 --> 00:57:19.840
<v Speaker 1>and he's dying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got to,</v>

1285
00:57:19.841 --> 00:57:22.700
<v Speaker 1>like a week ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he copies his mind connect.</v>

1286
00:57:22.750 --> 00:57:23.583
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quilvent of the genome and puts it into </v>

1287
00:57:24.911 --> 00:57:25.744
<v Speaker 1>a computer and then he dies and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>turned the computer on and he's in the </v>

1288
00:57:27.521 --> 00:57:29.260
<v Speaker 1>computer looking out through the little </v>
<v Speaker 1>camera hole.</v>

1289
00:57:29.950 --> 00:57:33.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't see how this could happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is if we copied you,</v>

1290
00:57:33.311 --> 00:57:34.480
<v Speaker 1>your connectome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>

1291
00:57:34.510 --> 00:57:35.343
<v Speaker 1>all your memories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we had a Joe Rogan number two copy </v>

1292
00:57:38.411 --> 00:57:40.930
<v Speaker 1>ready to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but instead of you dying,</v>

1293
00:57:40.990 --> 00:57:41.823
<v Speaker 1>let's say we had a sophisticated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If Mri brain scan machine slid you into </v>

1294
00:57:44.861 --> 00:57:46.180
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>copied your connectome,</v>

1295
00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:47.073
<v Speaker 1>uploaded it into the cloud or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we slide you back out and </v>

1296
00:57:49.961 --> 00:57:50.920
<v Speaker 1>you're standing there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1297
00:57:50.980 --> 00:57:52.840
<v Speaker 1>you're still looking at the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>through your eyes.</v>

1298
00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:55.090
<v Speaker 1>That's just Joe Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number two,</v>

1299
00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:58.760
<v Speaker 1>a copy and no more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you look at that than a twin looks at</v>

1300
00:57:58.761 --> 00:57:59.471
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sibling and says,</v>

1301
00:57:59.471 --> 00:58:00.310
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there I am.</v>

1302
00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:01.000
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1303
00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:01.900
<v Speaker 1>you're still standing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go,</v>

1304
00:58:01.901 --> 00:58:02.260
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1305
00:58:02.260 --> 00:58:04.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just a copy of me.</v>

1306
00:58:05.290 --> 00:58:06.123
<v Speaker 1>And so this to me seems a a central </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem with the mindup loading </v>

1307
00:58:09.731 --> 00:58:11.500
<v Speaker 1>scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a copy.</v>

1308
00:58:11.530 --> 00:58:12.363
<v Speaker 1>Did you see the thing in national </v>
<v Speaker 1>geographic today about the clone </v>

1309
00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:15.430
<v Speaker 1>monkeys?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1310
00:58:15.460 --> 00:58:16.293
<v Speaker 1>they've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've managed to actually clone </v>

1311
00:58:17.621 --> 00:58:18.850
<v Speaker 1>monkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1312
00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:19.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so Jamie,</v>

1313
00:58:19.961 --> 00:58:22.930
<v Speaker 1>I uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tweeted it earlier today.</v>

1314
00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:27.040
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy and were speculating that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can do that two monkeys,</v>

1315
00:58:27.041 --> 00:58:29.080
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be able to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do that to humans.</v>

1316
00:58:29.710 --> 00:58:31.030
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so who is right?</v>

1317
00:58:31.031 --> 00:58:32.860
<v Speaker 1>Who is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there's a Michael Shermer.</v>

1318
00:58:32.861 --> 00:58:36.160
<v Speaker 1>Is it your twin?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like when you meet twins,</v>

1319
00:58:36.500 --> 00:58:37.690
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very weird.</v>

1320
00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:39.370
<v Speaker 1>Like I used to date a girl who was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>twin.</v>

1321
00:58:39.430 --> 00:58:41.950
<v Speaker 1>She had a sister looked exactly like </v>
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>

1322
00:58:42.340 --> 00:58:43.173
<v Speaker 1>but like a little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a something just to feel like </v>

1323
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:51.000
<v Speaker 1>you're not super,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super confusing.</v>

1324
00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:55.270
<v Speaker 1>So they weren't the same person but they</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much were.</v>

1325
00:58:55.271 --> 00:58:55.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the,</v>

1326
00:58:55.870 --> 00:58:57.190
<v Speaker 1>here's the article,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scroll up there,</v>

1327
00:58:57.460 --> 00:58:59.470
<v Speaker 1>clone monkeys created in the lab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what?</v>

1328
00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:00.513
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1329
00:59:01.120 --> 00:59:03.520
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're making copies so it's a copy,</v>

1330
00:59:03.521 --> 00:59:04.354
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the same person because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they had their own individual life </v>

1331
00:59:06.131 --> 00:59:06.964
<v Speaker 1>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The moment you and your copy start </v>

1332
00:59:09.100 --> 00:59:11.490
<v Speaker 1>diverging away and lead leading </v>
<v Speaker 1>different lives,</v>

1333
00:59:11.491 --> 00:59:13.910
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna have different memories you</v>
<v Speaker 1>should have on your show.</v>

1334
00:59:14.050 --> 00:59:17.620
<v Speaker 1>Nancy Siegel from cal state fullerton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's the world's leading twin expert.</v>

1335
00:59:17.650 --> 00:59:18.483
<v Speaker 1>And she has all these great scenarios.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She a new book out called accidental </v>

1336
00:59:22.401 --> 00:59:27.401
<v Speaker 1>brothers and she has another book out on</v>
<v Speaker 1>switched at birth and Nancy Siegel and,</v>

1337
00:59:28.230 --> 00:59:30.380
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and these are scenarios that not only do</v>

1338
00:59:30.381 --> 00:59:31.214
<v Speaker 1>we have the behavior genetics studies </v>
<v Speaker 1>because she worked on the famous </v>

1339
00:59:34.101 --> 00:59:34.934
<v Speaker 1>Minnesota twins research,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the baseball team at the twins </v>

1340
00:59:36.831 --> 00:59:41.270
<v Speaker 1>research of twins separated at birth and</v>
<v Speaker 1>raised in different environments.</v>

1341
00:59:41.270 --> 00:59:41.630
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1342
00:59:41.630 --> 00:59:44.690
<v Speaker 1>the one raised in a Jewish home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other raised the Nazi Germany.</v>

1343
00:59:44.990 --> 00:59:46.790
<v Speaker 1>They get together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have the same watch,</v>

1344
00:59:46.791 --> 00:59:49.400
<v Speaker 1>they wear the same kind of clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they use the same toothpaste.</v>

1345
00:59:49.401 --> 00:59:53.060
<v Speaker 1>They married women that look pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty similar,</v>

1346
00:59:53.380 --> 00:59:54.213
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a lot that genetics does </v>

1347
00:59:55.341 --> 00:59:57.110
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very subtle.</v>

1348
00:59:57.111 --> 01:00:00.530
<v Speaker 1>There's no gene for like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're both Catholic or wearing this kind</v>

1349
01:00:00.531 --> 01:00:02.030
<v Speaker 1>of close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1350
01:00:02.031 --> 01:00:02.864
<v Speaker 1>if you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nancy explains that if you have a </v>

1351
01:00:03.921 --> 01:00:07.160
<v Speaker 1>certain body type,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which twins are going to have almost the</v>

1352
01:00:07.161 --> 01:00:09.890
<v Speaker 1>exact same body type.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certain clothes are going to look better</v>

1353
01:00:09.891 --> 01:00:11.720
<v Speaker 1>on you and you're more likely to pick </v>
<v Speaker 1>those.</v>

1354
01:00:11.721 --> 01:00:13.580
<v Speaker 1>So by chance are more likely to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>similarly.</v>

1355
01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:14.593
<v Speaker 1>There's no genes for clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but something like that body type or </v>

1356
01:00:16.941 --> 01:00:18.470
<v Speaker 1>temperament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1357
01:00:18.530 --> 01:00:20.710
<v Speaker 1>you have a certain kind of temperament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least half of which is,</v>

1358
01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:22.010
<v Speaker 1>is heritable.</v>

1359
01:00:22.010 --> 01:00:26.840
<v Speaker 1>So you're more likely to choose certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>professions or prefer certain hobbies or</v>

1360
01:00:26.841 --> 01:00:29.750
<v Speaker 1>activities or pick spouses that are kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

1361
01:00:29.850 --> 01:00:30.683
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would gel well with that </v>

1362
01:00:31.371 --> 01:00:33.490
<v Speaker 1>temperament.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this,</v>

1363
01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:35.540
<v Speaker 1>if you make good decisions though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well yeah,</v>

1364
01:00:35.541 --> 01:00:38.300
<v Speaker 1>there is that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an element of volition.</v>

1365
01:00:38.330 --> 01:00:40.760
<v Speaker 1>The choices you make in life do diverge </v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit.</v>

1366
01:00:40.761 --> 01:00:43.370
<v Speaker 1>So they're twins are a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>different from that,</v>

1367
01:00:43.371 --> 01:00:44.810
<v Speaker 1>but yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1368
01:00:44.930 --> 01:00:46.060
<v Speaker 1>but so a clone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1369
01:00:46.061 --> 01:00:46.894
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the moment you start leading separate </v>

1370
01:00:47.781 --> 01:00:48.614
<v Speaker 1>lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so why the copy of you is not going to </v>

1371
01:00:49.971 --> 01:00:52.610
<v Speaker 1>be you in heaven in religions have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same problem and you know,</v>

1372
01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:56.350
<v Speaker 1>if God is able to reconstruct your body </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1373
01:00:56.450 --> 01:00:59.870
<v Speaker 1>like a transporter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got into the world of Star Trek when I</v>

1374
01:00:59.871 --> 01:01:00.770
<v Speaker 1>was writing this book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1375
01:01:00.771 --> 01:01:03.290
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have this whole webpages devoted to</v>

1376
01:01:03.291 --> 01:01:04.780
<v Speaker 1>what does the transport do?</v>

1377
01:01:05.050 --> 01:01:05.661
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1378
01:01:05.661 --> 01:01:06.231
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1379
01:01:06.231 --> 01:01:07.160
<v Speaker 1>there's no transport it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1380
01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:09.590
<v Speaker 1>This is just science fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could be whatever it wants,</v>

1381
01:01:10.070 --> 01:01:10.903
<v Speaker 1>but is it copy and paste,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just copy you and reconstruct you </v>

1382
01:01:13.491 --> 01:01:15.980
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So with Adams on the other side or is it</v>

1383
01:01:15.981 --> 01:01:16.814
<v Speaker 1>cut and paste or is it the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They actually moved the atoms and </v>

1384
01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:20.593
<v Speaker 1>reconstruct it anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it does get to the problem of </v>

1385
01:01:23.421 --> 01:01:24.171
<v Speaker 1>identity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1386
01:01:24.171 --> 01:01:26.720
<v Speaker 1>what are you really because you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to.</v>

1387
01:01:26.721 --> 01:01:31.190
<v Speaker 1>It's not the matter the material.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really the pattern which is why the</v>

1388
01:01:31.191 --> 01:01:32.024
<v Speaker 1>singularity people focus on the cloud </v>
<v Speaker 1>and uploading the mind because the </v>

1389
01:01:34.730 --> 01:01:35.563
<v Speaker 1>information but the information is </v>
<v Speaker 1>always changing and how does the point </v>

1390
01:01:38.901 --> 01:01:41.510
<v Speaker 1>of view go with it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>See what the cryonics.</v>

1391
01:01:41.511 --> 01:01:42.344
<v Speaker 1>I can at least imagine that if I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>frozen and woken up somehow a thousand </v>

1392
01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:50.150
<v Speaker 1>years from now that I'd wake up like </v>
<v Speaker 1>like do after surgery or sleep.</v>

1393
01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:51.583
<v Speaker 1>I can't see how that would happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you flip on the switch and the </v>

1394
01:01:53.001 --> 01:01:56.090
<v Speaker 1>computer or in the cloud or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'd be there going,</v>

1395
01:01:56.091 --> 01:01:56.924
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here I am.</v>

1396
01:01:57.290 --> 01:01:59.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't there also the problem that every.</v>

1397
01:02:00.110 --> 01:02:01.670
<v Speaker 1>What is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven to 10 years?</v>

1398
01:02:01.730 --> 01:02:05.900
<v Speaker 1>Every cell in your body essentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>replaced except your neurons.</v>

1399
01:02:05.901 --> 01:02:07.520
<v Speaker 1>There's that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

1400
01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:09.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So are we just are neurons would.</v>

1401
01:02:09.951 --> 01:02:13.580
<v Speaker 1>That's the idea that that's what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>singularity or not your nose job.</v>

1402
01:02:13.660 --> 01:02:16.310
<v Speaker 1>That's fake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but fake lips.</v>

1403
01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:18.740
<v Speaker 1>That's your neurons only.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But even there,</v>

1404
01:02:18.741 --> 01:02:19.574
<v Speaker 1>see the transhumanists they imagined </v>
<v Speaker 1>this transitional stage where you start </v>

1405
01:02:22.351 --> 01:02:24.840
<v Speaker 1>wearing contact lenses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say they can call up the Internet.</v>

1406
01:02:24.841 --> 01:02:27.780
<v Speaker 1>And the moment I see you Joe Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the name pops up,</v>

1407
01:02:27.781 --> 01:02:28.614
<v Speaker 1>your wikipedia page pops up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know now I have this information </v>

1408
01:02:31.230 --> 01:02:32.670
<v Speaker 1>so I'm not bionic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

1409
01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:35.000
<v Speaker 1>but I'm also not just human transhuman.</v>

1410
01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:36.110
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then,</v>

1411
01:02:36.190 --> 01:02:37.980
<v Speaker 1>then who are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1412
01:02:37.981 --> 01:02:40.060
<v Speaker 1>So these are the sort of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>transitional stage.</v>

1413
01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:43.920
<v Speaker 1>So a cochlear implant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it kind of a brain chip and you know,</v>

1414
01:02:43.921 --> 01:02:44.754
<v Speaker 1>probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you know about that research of </v>

1415
01:02:45.681 --> 01:02:46.514
<v Speaker 1>the paraplegic quadriplegic man who can </v>
<v Speaker 1>control his computer a cursor and now </v>

1416
01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:53.913
<v Speaker 1>they can actually control a fake </v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial limb just by thinking about </v>

1417
01:02:57.331 --> 01:02:58.164
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they put a chip in his motor cortex </v>

1418
01:02:59.041 --> 01:02:59.874
<v Speaker 1>that reads the thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he has these thoughts and he's been </v>

1419
01:03:01.531 --> 01:03:02.364
<v Speaker 1>trained to pull the cup of water up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>his mouth and drink with the artificial </v>

1420
01:03:06.211 --> 01:03:08.170
<v Speaker 1>arm at some point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1421
01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:09.540
<v Speaker 1>say 50 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hundred years from now,</v>

1422
01:03:09.541 --> 01:03:10.374
<v Speaker 1>we should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could have it all mapped and you can </v>

1423
01:03:11.701 --> 01:03:13.710
<v Speaker 1>control your whole environment just by </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>

1424
01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:16.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like to hear Mozart and you just</v>

1425
01:03:16.201 --> 01:03:19.230
<v Speaker 1>think about it and then the music in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your house comes on and it's Mozart.</v>

1426
01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:19.761
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1427
01:03:19.761 --> 01:03:22.040
<v Speaker 3>I freak out about Siri sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1428
01:03:22.090 --> 01:03:22.923
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my daughter asked me about a song that </v>

1429
01:03:24.471 --> 01:03:25.304
<v Speaker 3>she likes and we were in the car and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>pressed the Siri Button on my phone and </v>

1430
01:03:29.931 --> 01:03:30.760
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1431
01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:34.370
<v Speaker 3>it's some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's that new musical with the,</v>

1432
01:03:34.610 --> 01:03:37.580
<v Speaker 3>what's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hugh Jackman Wolverine Guy.</v>

1433
01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:39.073
<v Speaker 3>Some some musical that's based on </v>
<v Speaker 3>ringling brothers and Barnum and Bailey </v>

1434
01:03:41.451 --> 01:03:45.080
<v Speaker 3>circus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She wanted the song.</v>

1435
01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:46.273
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1436
01:03:46.310 --> 01:03:50.180
<v Speaker 3>I literally asked Siri to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it started playing it instantly,</v>

1437
01:03:50.230 --> 01:03:51.063
<v Speaker 3>like within a couple of seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this is crazy that this thing just </v>

1438
01:03:54.981 --> 01:03:58.610
<v Speaker 3>pulled it out of the sky and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>playing it in my car.</v>

1439
01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:00.410
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did that the other night.</v>

1440
01:04:00.411 --> 01:04:02.420
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to hear Bob segers Hollywood </v>
<v Speaker 1>nights.</v>

1441
01:04:02.421 --> 01:04:05.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure why I got that in my head </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it popped right up.</v>

1442
01:04:05.391 --> 01:04:07.520
<v Speaker 1>There's a youtube video of him from </v>
<v Speaker 1>1978.</v>

1443
01:04:07.521 --> 01:04:08.780
<v Speaker 1>Just rocking it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1444
01:04:08.781 --> 01:04:09.614
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing that I'm just driving on </v>

1445
01:04:10.961 --> 01:04:12.970
<v Speaker 1>the freeway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heading back home to Santa Barbara.</v>

1446
01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:15.260
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to hear Bob Seger.</v>

1447
01:04:15.470 --> 01:04:16.710
<v Speaker 3>Hollywood nights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1448
01:04:16.790 --> 01:04:19.910
<v Speaker 3>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The greatest showman.</v>

1449
01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:22.130
<v Speaker 3>That's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My daughter loves that movie,</v>

1450
01:04:22.430 --> 01:04:23.263
<v Speaker 3>so she wanted to hear the song,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I just talked to the phone and it </v>

1451
01:04:26.271 --> 01:04:28.580
<v Speaker 3>did that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When are we going to get past that?</v>

1452
01:04:28.581 --> 01:04:30.240
<v Speaker 3>Talking to the phone instead of </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking.</v>

1453
01:04:30.370 --> 01:04:31.203
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I'm pretty comfortable with </v>

1454
01:04:32.991 --> 01:04:34.190
<v Speaker 3>looking for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me.</v>

1455
01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:34.941
<v Speaker 3>Hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>honey,</v>

1456
01:04:34.941 --> 01:04:37.160
<v Speaker 3>let me find it online.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go get it.</v>

1457
01:04:37.161 --> 01:04:38.300
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me download it.</v>

1458
01:04:38.301 --> 01:04:40.670
<v Speaker 3>Let me pay for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me use my thumbprint or whatever,</v>

1459
01:04:40.940 --> 01:04:44.210
<v Speaker 3>and then now it's just talk to your </v>
<v Speaker 3>phone right when.</v>

1460
01:04:44.211 --> 01:04:45.600
<v Speaker 3>When is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just pull it up.</v>

1461
01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:48.080
<v Speaker 3>I want to hear led Zeppelin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whole Lotta love.</v>

1462
01:04:48.110 --> 01:04:48.943
<v Speaker 3>I'll just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll just start thinking that starts </v>

1463
01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:54.740
<v Speaker 3>playing and when is that going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen?</v>

1464
01:04:54.741 --> 01:04:55.950
<v Speaker 3>That's probably coming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're,</v>

1465
01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:59.270
<v Speaker 3>we're probably all going to give in to </v>
<v Speaker 3>some sort of a chip.</v>

1466
01:04:59.570 --> 01:05:02.690
<v Speaker 3>Something that we can get implanted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Simple,</v>

1467
01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:05.660
<v Speaker 3>easy trans dermal device,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1468
01:05:05.661 --> 01:05:07.400
<v Speaker 3>fashionable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd go to a club,</v>

1469
01:05:07.401 --> 01:05:11.210
<v Speaker 3>it glows who you got the new one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>iphone 38.</v>

1470
01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:12.633
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think all that's far more likely to </v>

1471
01:05:13.611 --> 01:05:14.444
<v Speaker 1>happen before we get to the point where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could copy and entire brain in and </v>

1472
01:05:17.890 --> 01:05:18.130
<v Speaker 1>put</v>

1473
01:05:18.130 --> 01:05:22.200
<v Speaker 2>it in a clone of your body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I interviewed Kurzweil and uh,</v>

1474
01:05:22.201 --> 01:05:23.034
<v Speaker 2>I had a really interesting conversation </v>
<v Speaker 2>with him for the Scifi show that was </v>

1475
01:05:25.590 --> 01:05:30.590
<v Speaker 2>doing a few years back and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find him to be very interesting.</v>

1476
01:05:30.791 --> 01:05:34.420
<v Speaker 2>He's a fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredibly intelligent guy that has,</v>

1477
01:05:34.810 --> 01:05:35.643
<v Speaker 2>I think he has more than a hundred </v>
<v Speaker 2>different patents and things things </v>

1478
01:05:38.830 --> 01:05:39.970
<v Speaker 2>invented.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a genius.</v>

1479
01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:45.000
<v Speaker 2>He's a bonafide genius,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I also found it incredibly,</v>

1480
01:05:46.100 --> 01:05:49.870
<v Speaker 2>a sad his motivation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what he's trying to do,</v>

1481
01:05:49.871 --> 01:05:51.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's trying to recreate his father.</v>

1482
01:05:51.491 --> 01:05:52.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1483
01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:53.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they didn't see that,</v>

1484
01:05:53.210 --> 01:05:54.260
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the documentary better.</v>

1485
01:05:54.290 --> 01:05:55.123
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1486
01:05:55.130 --> 01:05:56.770
<v Speaker 2>Transcended,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was kind of sad.</v>

1487
01:05:56.980 --> 01:05:57.813
<v Speaker 2>It's dark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very dark and he's got all his </v>

1488
01:06:00.011 --> 01:06:03.160
<v Speaker 2>basement is filled with all his dad's </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff and um,</v>

1489
01:06:03.250 --> 01:06:05.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he always talking about life,</v>

1490
01:06:05.741 --> 01:06:06.461
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

1491
01:06:06.461 --> 01:06:08.650
<v Speaker 2>but he just really kind of obsessed with</v>
<v Speaker 2>death.</v>

1492
01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:10.540
<v Speaker 2>This is what I worry about is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1493
01:06:10.541 --> 01:06:12.040
<v Speaker 2>back to the Elvis era,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1494
01:06:12.041 --> 01:06:13.600
<v Speaker 2>we don't live in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the next life,</v>

1495
01:06:13.601 --> 01:06:14.434
<v Speaker 2>whatever that is or the far future we </v>
<v Speaker 2>live now and don't miss it if you're so </v>

1496
01:06:18.281 --> 01:06:21.760
<v Speaker 2>focused on death and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how we can solve these problems.</v>

1497
01:06:21.761 --> 01:06:23.320
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad somebody working on it and he's</v>

1498
01:06:23.321 --> 01:06:25.660
<v Speaker 2>head of engineering for all of Google </v>
<v Speaker 2>now and they had that company,</v>

1499
01:06:25.690 --> 01:06:26.523
<v Speaker 2>Calico,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so a couple of hundred million dollars </v>

1500
01:06:28.121 --> 01:06:29.890
<v Speaker 2>working on aging problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

1501
01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:31.690
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you could solve Alzheimer's,</v>

1502
01:06:31.750 --> 01:06:32.770
<v Speaker 2>those things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's great,</v>

1503
01:06:32.771 --> 01:06:36.130
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't be so focused on the next life you</v>

1504
01:06:36.131 --> 01:06:37.300
<v Speaker 2>miss out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1505
01:06:37.301 --> 01:06:40.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't necessarily know if he is so </v>
<v Speaker 2>focused that he's missing out.</v>

1506
01:06:40.961 --> 01:06:41.794
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he's missing out on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he has extraordinary vision in </v>

1507
01:06:46.061 --> 01:06:49.870
<v Speaker 2>terms of like what is possible with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>exponential increase of technology.</v>

1508
01:06:49.871 --> 01:06:52.270
<v Speaker 2>So I think having a guy like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>around,</v>

1509
01:06:53.020 --> 01:06:54.490
<v Speaker 2>it's helpful.</v>

1510
01:06:54.490 --> 01:06:56.740
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's beneficial to everybody.</v>

1511
01:06:56.741 --> 01:06:59.640
<v Speaker 2>It's incredibly fascinating to hear him </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about those things.</v>

1512
01:07:00.330 --> 01:07:02.440
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm too dumb to know if he's right.</v>

1513
01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:04.320
<v Speaker 2>What I'm hearing him talk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1514
01:07:04.321 --> 01:07:05.500
<v Speaker 2>you think really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

1515
01:07:05.501 --> 01:07:06.161
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By 20,</v>

1516
01:07:06.161 --> 01:07:08.770
<v Speaker 2>45 will be downloading our brain into a </v>
<v Speaker 2>computer.</v>

1517
01:07:08.771 --> 01:07:09.940
<v Speaker 2>Mind man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1518
01:07:10.010 --> 01:07:12.180
<v Speaker 2>That shit seems close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1519
01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:15.700
<v Speaker 2>it's 2018 man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean when I interviewed him,</v>

1520
01:07:15.701 --> 01:07:18.490
<v Speaker 2>I think it was probably 2013 or </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere around then.</v>

1521
01:07:18.610 --> 01:07:20.620
<v Speaker 2>Although to be fair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you said,</v>

1522
01:07:20.780 --> 01:07:22.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a century ago when they had telegraphed,</v>

1523
01:07:22.810 --> 01:07:24.970
<v Speaker 2>well more than a century ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the invention of the Telegraph,</v>

1524
01:07:24.971 --> 01:07:25.804
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a century and a half or so you're </v>

1525
01:07:27.191 --> 01:07:28.024
<v Speaker 2>going to be pressing a button and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>calling out what you want on a little </v>

1526
01:07:31.030 --> 01:07:32.740
<v Speaker 2>box.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd be like urine saying this,</v>

1527
01:07:33.100 --> 01:07:34.400
<v Speaker 2>what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Smoking?</v>

1528
01:07:35.050 --> 01:07:36.970
<v Speaker 2>And here we are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1529
01:07:37.070 --> 01:07:42.070
<v Speaker 2>so this way science fiction is usually </v>
<v Speaker 2>set far enough in advance like a century</v>

1530
01:07:42.670 --> 01:07:45.880
<v Speaker 2>or two rather than in the historical </v>
<v Speaker 2>present.</v>

1531
01:07:46.150 --> 01:07:48.580
<v Speaker 2>So that you can populate these kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1532
01:07:48.581 --> 01:07:50.380
<v Speaker 2>This is what science fiction writers </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell me.</v>

1533
01:07:50.410 --> 01:07:51.860
<v Speaker 2>If you set it up far enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1534
01:07:52.510 --> 01:07:54.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>readers are willing to suspend disbelief</v>

1535
01:07:54.551 --> 01:07:55.031
<v Speaker 2>because.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1536
01:07:55.031 --> 01:07:56.980
<v Speaker 2>it seems possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look what we've been able to do.</v>

1537
01:07:57.220 --> 01:07:57.911
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1538
01:07:57.911 --> 01:07:59.410
<v Speaker 2>fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we can do that,</v>

1539
01:07:59.820 --> 01:08:01.480
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm all for it.</v>

1540
01:08:01.481 --> 01:08:02.800
<v Speaker 2>That'd be great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1541
01:08:02.801 --> 01:08:04.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm all for it too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But boy,</v>

1542
01:08:04.631 --> 01:08:05.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1543
01:08:05.621 --> 01:08:06.454
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been very convinced and more so </v>

1544
01:08:09.401 --> 01:08:14.401
<v Speaker 2>over time that human beings in this form</v>
<v Speaker 2>that our time is limited.</v>

1545
01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:16.040
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1546
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:16.873
<v Speaker 2>when artificial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think even the word artificial </v>

1547
01:08:19.521 --> 01:08:23.450
<v Speaker 2>life is a weird word to throw around </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's not going to be artificial.</v>

1548
01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:25.020
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be an actual thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1549
01:08:25.220 --> 01:08:28.610
<v Speaker 2>It's just going to be non biological.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1550
01:08:28.780 --> 01:08:29.613
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what life is outside of </v>

1551
01:08:32.541 --> 01:08:32.990
<v Speaker 2>earth.</v>

1552
01:08:32.990 --> 01:08:36.770
<v Speaker 2>I think that humans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we do with our curiosity,</v>

1553
01:08:36.771 --> 01:08:39.590
<v Speaker 2>if there's other curiosity in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the universe,</v>

1554
01:08:39.591 --> 01:08:42.350
<v Speaker 2>other curious life forms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they probably do the same thing.</v>

1555
01:08:42.351 --> 01:08:43.040
<v Speaker 2>They realized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1556
01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:43.873
<v Speaker 2>there's a massive limitation in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 2>biological tissue and in terms of our </v>

1557
01:08:48.921 --> 01:08:51.320
<v Speaker 2>ability to evolve like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1558
01:08:51.321 --> 01:08:52.154
<v Speaker 2>I could just reprogram a phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your phone involves way quicker than </v>

1559
01:08:54.951 --> 01:08:57.080
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They go back to the goodyear.</v>

1560
01:08:57.440 --> 01:09:02.030
<v Speaker 2>I have an iphone x right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go back and think about an iphone one.</v>

1561
01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:06.140
<v Speaker 2>That's a piece of shit that you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go back to a decade,</v>

1562
01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:08.690
<v Speaker 2>a decade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then it go back to that clinic.</v>

1563
01:09:10.190 --> 01:09:11.023
<v Speaker 2>Seti scientists or scientists tend to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>skeptical of the UFO alien abduction </v>

1564
01:09:14.451 --> 01:09:17.180
<v Speaker 2>stories because if we do encounter </v>
<v Speaker 2>aliens coming here,</v>

1565
01:09:17.330 --> 01:09:19.000
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to be biological.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1566
01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:19.873
<v Speaker 2>they're going to be computers or </v>
<v Speaker 2>machines because that's the only thing </v>

1567
01:09:22.341 --> 01:09:24.710
<v Speaker 2>they can survive the long distances.</v>

1568
01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:27.650
<v Speaker 2>Long time of interstellar space flight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1569
01:09:27.651 --> 01:09:28.484
<v Speaker 2>I think we're just so wrapped up in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea of biology being so important that </v>

1570
01:09:33.750 --> 01:09:36.890
<v Speaker 2>you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has to breed the normal way with eggs</v>

1571
01:09:36.891 --> 01:09:38.930
<v Speaker 2>and sperm or otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's bullshit.</v>

1572
01:09:40.110 --> 01:09:41.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean we think of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1573
01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:42.190
<v Speaker 2>but biology is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1574
01:09:42.250 --> 01:09:44.770
<v Speaker 2>wet stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but really their machines,</v>

1575
01:09:44.780 --> 01:09:48.140
<v Speaker 2>a cell is a machine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just processing molecules,</v>

1576
01:09:48.620 --> 01:09:51.570
<v Speaker 2>which is what nanobots are going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to process molecule.</v>

1577
01:09:51.580 --> 01:09:53.390
<v Speaker 2>So it's really just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all machines.</v>

1578
01:09:53.630 --> 01:09:55.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's cellular machines and,</v>

1579
01:09:55.730 --> 01:09:56.563
<v Speaker 2>and you know when they talk about things</v>
<v Speaker 2>like quantum computing and things get </v>

1580
01:09:59.991 --> 01:10:01.490
<v Speaker 2>really squirrely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1581
01:10:01.530 --> 01:10:01.951
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

1582
01:10:01.951 --> 01:10:02.930
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you saying?</v>

1583
01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:04.820
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean by quantum computing?</v>

1584
01:10:04.850 --> 01:10:06.020
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like where is this?</v>

1585
01:10:06.170 --> 01:10:07.003
<v Speaker 2>Is this a computer?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like does this use like a regular </v>

1586
01:10:09.291 --> 01:10:11.780
<v Speaker 2>motherboard?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how does it have a CPU?</v>

1587
01:10:12.140 --> 01:10:12.761
<v Speaker 2>Like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1588
01:10:12.761 --> 01:10:14.870
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's next stage after that?</v>

1589
01:10:14.871 --> 01:10:17.810
<v Speaker 2>Like what do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

1590
01:10:18.530 --> 01:10:22.460
<v Speaker 2>what resemblance is it going to have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything that we think of today in terms</v>

1591
01:10:22.461 --> 01:10:25.040
<v Speaker 2>of technology that we're accustomed to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1592
01:10:25.690 --> 01:10:27.380
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it really makes the point that,</v>

1593
01:10:27.381 --> 01:10:28.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he try track,</v>

1594
01:10:28.610 --> 01:10:29.443
<v Speaker 2>say back to the 19 fifties where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have computers the size of this room </v>

1595
01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:34.340
<v Speaker 2>down to now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1596
01:10:34.341 --> 01:10:38.120
<v Speaker 2>So you just keep the curve going and </v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually there'll be the size of blood</v>

1597
01:10:38.121 --> 01:10:38.954
<v Speaker 2>cells and you just ingest these little </v>
<v Speaker 2>computers and then go in there and they </v>

1598
01:10:41.511 --> 01:10:46.180
<v Speaker 2>fix your mutant dna in the bacteria that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are in there.</v>

1599
01:10:46.190 --> 01:10:48.170
<v Speaker 2>They repair blood vessels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sort of thing.</v>

1600
01:10:48.470 --> 01:10:52.190
<v Speaker 2>This is what he's envisioning and I can </v>
<v Speaker 2>conceive of it in principle,</v>

1601
01:10:52.191 --> 01:10:53.210
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're,</v>

1602
01:10:53.330 --> 01:10:57.920
<v Speaker 2>I forget whose law is in any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any trend that cannot go on forever,</v>

1603
01:10:57.921 --> 01:10:58.754
<v Speaker 2>won't.</v>

1604
01:10:59.820 --> 01:11:01.500
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1605
01:11:01.540 --> 01:11:03.810
<v Speaker 2>So if it gets to a certain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>

1606
01:11:03.980 --> 01:11:04.813
<v Speaker 2>like Moore's law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the doubling of that can't go on </v>

1607
01:11:06.081 --> 01:11:09.020
<v Speaker 2>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the quantum computing people say,</v>

1608
01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:09.980
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

1609
01:11:09.981 --> 01:11:10.814
<v Speaker 2>It'll stop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're going to do this other thing </v>

1610
01:11:11.580 --> 01:11:14.220
<v Speaker 2>that is completely okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1611
01:11:14.250 --> 01:11:17.340
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well boy,</v>

1612
01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:20.113
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's so many things to </v>

1613
01:11:21.601 --> 01:11:24.570
<v Speaker 2>speculate about in terms of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>potential future,</v>

1614
01:11:24.870 --> 01:11:26.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>

1615
01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:26.913
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1616
01:11:26.930 --> 01:11:31.350
<v Speaker 2>the fear of death is a very odd one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's normal,</v>

1617
01:11:31.351 --> 01:11:32.850
<v Speaker 2>it's natural,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's biological.</v>

1618
01:11:32.851 --> 01:11:34.830
<v Speaker 2>Animals have it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every human has it.</v>

1619
01:11:34.831 --> 01:11:37.200
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's scared to die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one's scared to go to sleep,</v>

1620
01:11:37.530 --> 01:11:38.363
<v Speaker 2>but everyone's scared to die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's this idea that this would be </v>

1621
01:11:41.461 --> 01:11:43.440
<v Speaker 2>the end of the party,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1622
01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:46.620
<v Speaker 2>But really there's nothing to fear </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you won't even know it.</v>

1623
01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:48.310
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is.</v>

1624
01:11:48.490 --> 01:11:52.290
<v Speaker 2>As long as you're alive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're Santi and conscious of existence.</v>

1625
01:11:52.290 --> 01:11:54.510
<v Speaker 2>And then not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

1626
01:11:54.610 --> 01:11:55.443
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you ask people to quote surveys in </v>

1627
01:11:56.581 --> 01:11:57.031
<v Speaker 2>the book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1628
01:11:57.031 --> 01:11:57.864
<v Speaker 2>how long would you like to live it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's always about what the average </v>

1629
01:12:01.321 --> 01:12:02.131
<v Speaker 2>lifespan is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

1630
01:12:02.131 --> 01:12:02.881
<v Speaker 2>People go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

1631
01:12:02.881 --> 01:12:05.150
<v Speaker 2>I think I'd like to live in [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 2>82 or so.</v>

1632
01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:07.950
<v Speaker 2>But if we fast forward you to 80.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1633
01:12:07.951 --> 01:12:09.600
<v Speaker 2>your time's up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tomorrow's your day.</v>

1634
01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:11.910
<v Speaker 2>No way to get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Give me another week.</v>

1635
01:12:12.420 --> 01:12:15.420
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's everybody I need another month.</v>

1636
01:12:15.421 --> 01:12:17.170
<v Speaker 2>A year to run my first marathon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1637
01:12:17.380 --> 01:12:18.213
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1638
01:12:18.570 --> 01:12:21.150
<v Speaker 2>I contend that it's a silly argument </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you know,</v>

1639
01:12:21.151 --> 01:12:22.320
<v Speaker 2>that people say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1640
01:12:22.330 --> 01:12:27.210
<v Speaker 2>I think we should have a limit on our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our lifespan and that we need to die,</v>

1641
01:12:27.211 --> 01:12:27.721
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1642
01:12:27.721 --> 01:12:29.190
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you personally,</v>

1643
01:12:29.250 --> 01:12:31.050
<v Speaker 2>are you going to check out when it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>your time?</v>

1644
01:12:31.450 --> 01:12:32.670
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course they would.</v>

1645
01:12:33.060 --> 01:12:35.300
<v Speaker 2>As long as we're talking about being </v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy and in,</v>

1646
01:12:35.330 --> 01:12:37.290
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in cognitively aware,</v>

1647
01:12:37.710 --> 01:12:39.410
<v Speaker 2>then most people want to continue.</v>

1648
01:12:39.530 --> 01:12:41.460
<v Speaker 2>Let me severely depressed suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1649
01:12:41.461 --> 01:12:42.294
<v Speaker 2>that's an issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but most people would want to continue </v>

1650
01:12:44.071 --> 01:12:44.904
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a point in favor of the </v>

1651
01:12:46.250 --> 01:12:47.083
<v Speaker 2>transhumanists that yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people will want to keep going on as </v>

1652
01:12:49.591 --> 01:12:52.950
<v Speaker 2>long as they're healthy and happy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>leading fulfilled lives.</v>

1653
01:12:53.670 --> 01:12:56.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As long as everything's healthy.</v>

1654
01:12:56.310 --> 01:13:01.310
<v Speaker 2>My grandmother had a stroke and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>gave her 72 hours.</v>

1655
01:13:01.710 --> 01:13:03.690
<v Speaker 2>She wound up living 12 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

1656
01:13:04.050 --> 01:13:05.400
<v Speaker 2>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was awful.</v>

1657
01:13:05.401 --> 01:13:06.690
<v Speaker 2>She had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she had an aneurysm.</v>

1658
01:13:07.370 --> 01:13:08.670
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 12 years was awful.</v>

1659
01:13:08.910 --> 01:13:10.710
<v Speaker 2>It was awful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was horrific.</v>

1660
01:13:11.030 --> 01:13:12.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was really bad.</v>

1661
01:13:12.241 --> 01:13:15.480
<v Speaker 2>She was bedridden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She would moan.</v>

1662
01:13:15.481 --> 01:13:18.180
<v Speaker 2>She was always in pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When she died,</v>

1663
01:13:18.210 --> 01:13:20.430
<v Speaker 2>it was a relief for everyone in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>family.</v>

1664
01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:22.410
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1665
01:13:22.411 --> 01:13:23.244
<v Speaker 2>we lost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Grandma was like grandma's mps now </v>

1666
01:13:26.610 --> 01:13:29.160
<v Speaker 2>because for the longest time she was in </v>
<v Speaker 2>agony.</v>

1667
01:13:29.161 --> 01:13:32.610
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I stayed with them when I first moved to</v>

1668
01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:33.913
<v Speaker 2>New York.</v>

1669
01:13:33.990 --> 01:13:37.590
<v Speaker 2>They lived in New Jersey and I live with</v>
<v Speaker 2>them for a few months while I was saving</v>

1670
01:13:37.591 --> 01:13:41.070
<v Speaker 2>up money for an apartment and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a horrific man.</v>

1671
01:13:41.100 --> 01:13:44.880
<v Speaker 2>She would be moaning and grandfather had</v>
<v Speaker 2>to take care of her and they had a nurse</v>

1672
01:13:44.881 --> 01:13:46.560
<v Speaker 2>would come over and take care of her as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

1673
01:13:46.561 --> 01:13:47.394
<v Speaker 2>It was just a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Europeans have a more advanced </v>

1674
01:13:50.970 --> 01:13:51.803
<v Speaker 2>humanist type perspective on that </v>
<v Speaker 2>euthanasia or physician assisted </v>

1675
01:13:55.021 --> 01:13:55.711
<v Speaker 2>suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1676
01:13:55.711 --> 01:13:56.544
<v Speaker 2>they're doing that now and a few states,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's still this kind of sort of </v>

1677
01:14:00.121 --> 01:14:04.350
<v Speaker 2>Christian ethic of only God can decide </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can't make those decisions.</v>

1678
01:14:04.740 --> 01:14:05.573
<v Speaker 2>And these are people more like Christian</v>
<v Speaker 2>conservatives who otherwise think the </v>

1679
01:14:08.401 --> 01:14:11.980
<v Speaker 2>government should stay out of your life </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you make your own and you</v>

1680
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:14.740
<v Speaker 1>take personal responsibility except when</v>
<v Speaker 1>it comes to your death.</v>

1681
01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:15.131
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1682
01:14:15.131 --> 01:14:16.990
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why can't I choose that?</v>

1683
01:14:16.991 --> 01:14:18.490
<v Speaker 1>While they worry about abuse?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1684
01:14:18.491 --> 01:14:19.840
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just have rules about,</v>

1685
01:14:20.170 --> 01:14:21.003
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to sign something and we have </v>

1686
01:14:21.770 --> 01:14:23.920
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Video Kevorkian used to video tape,</v>

1687
01:14:24.100 --> 01:14:26.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his patients saying,</v>

1688
01:14:26.131 --> 01:14:26.964
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I choose to do this when they could </v>

1689
01:14:27.971 --> 01:14:30.640
<v Speaker 1>still do it anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

1690
01:14:30.730 --> 01:14:31.563
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1691
01:14:31.820 --> 01:14:34.570
<v Speaker 1>how we deal with death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always been a huge problem.</v>

1692
01:14:34.571 --> 01:14:36.850
<v Speaker 1>It makes people uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1693
01:14:36.970 --> 01:14:37.930
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1694
01:14:37.931 --> 01:14:38.764
<v Speaker 1>how we talk about it matters and I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the motives for me writing this </v>

1695
01:14:41.231 --> 01:14:43.480
<v Speaker 1>book is like I've written about science </v>
<v Speaker 1>and pseudoscience.</v>

1696
01:14:43.481 --> 01:14:45.700
<v Speaker 1>Science and religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Science and guts signed some morality,</v>

1697
01:14:46.060 --> 01:14:46.480
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1698
01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:49.060
<v Speaker 1>really this is the big question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1699
01:14:49.140 --> 01:14:52.300
<v Speaker 1>what happens when you die and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that you know,</v>

1700
01:14:52.330 --> 01:14:53.163
<v Speaker 1>that people think about a lot or they </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought about a lot for a long time and </v>

1701
01:14:56.621 --> 01:14:57.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1702
01:14:57.850 --> 01:14:59.410
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and nobody knows.</v>

1703
01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:00.460
<v Speaker 1>I contend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1704
01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:02.450
<v Speaker 1>nobody knows for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1705
01:15:02.470 --> 01:15:03.303
<v Speaker 1>so we write these stories that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>make us feel better because the whole </v>

1706
01:15:06.071 --> 01:15:06.904
<v Speaker 1>theory called terror management theory </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is premised on the idea that fear </v>

1707
01:15:10.601 --> 01:15:11.434
<v Speaker 1>of death is what drives civilization and</v>
<v Speaker 1>creativity and productivity and </v>

1708
01:15:14.621 --> 01:15:19.330
<v Speaker 1>architects and artists and scientists </v>
<v Speaker 1>are driven by this fear of death.</v>

1709
01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:22.900
<v Speaker 1>But if you ask people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you walk around in a state of fear of</v>

1710
01:15:22.901 --> 01:15:23.470
<v Speaker 1>death?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most?</v>

1711
01:15:23.470 --> 01:15:24.780
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't to it.</v>

1712
01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:26.140
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's unconscious.</v>

1713
01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:27.191
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

1714
01:15:27.191 --> 01:15:30.430
<v Speaker 1>But how do you know if it's unconscious?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have to hit these experiments with</v>

1715
01:15:30.431 --> 01:15:32.560
<v Speaker 1>a prime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The brain sort of try to trick it out of</v>

1716
01:15:32.561 --> 01:15:35.320
<v Speaker 1>you and almost aren't they?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people are busy.</v>

1717
01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:36.333
<v Speaker 1>They're busy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1718
01:15:36.580 --> 01:15:38.890
<v Speaker 1>The fear of death comes when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>living alone at night.</v>

1719
01:15:38.950 --> 01:15:39.783
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it going to be a day when I </v>

1720
01:15:40.871 --> 01:15:41.560
<v Speaker 1>don't wake up?</v>

1721
01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:42.390
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna.</v>

1722
01:15:42.390 --> 01:15:44.170
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he'll die tonight while I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>sleeping,</v>

1723
01:15:44.470 --> 01:15:46.030
<v Speaker 1>but you'd never know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just,</v>

1724
01:15:46.370 --> 01:15:47.850
<v Speaker 1>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just lights out and that's,</v>

1725
01:15:47.851 --> 01:15:50.860
<v Speaker 1>that's the greatest way to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ever go to sleep and don't wake up.</v>

1726
01:15:50.890 --> 01:15:52.040
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

1727
01:15:52.300 --> 01:15:54.040
<v Speaker 1>Guy In your bed peacefully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

1728
01:15:54.430 --> 01:15:55.630
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good way to go.</v>

1729
01:15:55.660 --> 01:15:56.680
<v Speaker 1>Which is why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1730
01:15:56.681 --> 01:15:58.250
<v Speaker 1>hospice is probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1731
01:15:58.270 --> 01:16:03.070
<v Speaker 1>a really good thing that we're getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>better at it in the west of just helping</v>

1732
01:16:03.071 --> 01:16:03.904
<v Speaker 1>people make that transition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why back to near death </v>

1733
01:16:06.071 --> 01:16:08.140
<v Speaker 1>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be those brain chemistry,</v>

1734
01:16:08.230 --> 01:16:11.200
<v Speaker 1>the brain chemicals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what they evolved for was to help</v>

1735
01:16:11.201 --> 01:16:13.690
<v Speaker 1>that process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As your brain is shutting down,</v>

1736
01:16:13.990 --> 01:16:14.823
<v Speaker 1>you feel this sort of glow or this sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of good feeling that you know there's a </v>

1737
01:16:17.891 --> 01:16:18.724
<v Speaker 1>tunnel you're going to pass through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of transitioning to some other </v>

1738
01:16:20.711 --> 01:16:21.544
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this starts off very early in life </v>

1739
01:16:23.501 --> 01:16:23.660
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

1740
01:16:23.660 --> 01:16:27.790
<v Speaker 1>I cite research by Paul Bloom and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>lab at Yale with little kids,</v>

1741
01:16:27.791 --> 01:16:28.624
<v Speaker 1>so he presents them with this little </v>
<v Speaker 1>puppet show and so you have this little </v>

1742
01:16:31.211 --> 01:16:32.044
<v Speaker 1>mouse and this alligator and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>alligator munches the mouse and he's </v>

1743
01:16:33.881 --> 01:16:35.740
<v Speaker 1>dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's the mouse now?</v>

1744
01:16:35.770 --> 01:16:36.870
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mouse at this.</v>

1745
01:16:36.871 --> 01:16:37.704
<v Speaker 1>Other than this other place and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>misses his mom and he's hungry and he's </v>

1746
01:16:40.300 --> 01:16:43.330
<v Speaker 1>scared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So and this is like preschoolers.</v>

1747
01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:47.890
<v Speaker 1>So it starts pretty young that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>dualistic idea that something transcends</v>

1748
01:16:47.891 --> 01:16:48.724
<v Speaker 1>the physical body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something else that continues </v>

1749
01:16:50.890 --> 01:16:51.723
<v Speaker 1>and I contend that that's because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't conceive of nothing that just </v>

1750
01:16:55.350 --> 01:16:56.183
<v Speaker 1>don't perceive my own brain operating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it feels like thoughts are floating </v>

1751
01:16:58.931 --> 01:17:03.340
<v Speaker 1>around up there and I feel like a kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a set of patterns that would continue</v>

1752
01:17:03.341 --> 01:17:08.341
<v Speaker 1>beyond the physical body feels that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So our intuitions I think naturally lead</v>

1753
01:17:08.411 --> 01:17:10.220
<v Speaker 1>to the idea of some kind of afterlife</v>

1754
01:17:10.220 --> 01:17:11.053
<v Speaker 2>or something continues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is possible or is it possible that </v>

1755
01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:17.173
<v Speaker 2>all these different cultures and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these different people have these </v>

1756
01:17:19.761 --> 01:17:22.700
<v Speaker 2>concepts because maybe something does </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

1757
01:17:23.450 --> 01:17:24.670
<v Speaker 2>Maybe some that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1758
01:17:24.690 --> 01:17:25.523
<v Speaker 2>It could be something that could </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibly happen to whatever we think of </v>

1759
01:17:28.911 --> 01:17:29.744
<v Speaker 2>as consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's sort of what we think of as you </v>

1760
01:17:31.671 --> 01:17:32.504
<v Speaker 2>and I think most of our consciousness is</v>
<v Speaker 2>weighed down by life experiences and </v>

1761
01:17:36.231 --> 01:17:37.064
<v Speaker 2>genetics and our environment and all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that we carry around in our head </v>

1762
01:17:42.711 --> 01:17:45.390
<v Speaker 2>is memories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean this is a big part of what,</v>

1763
01:17:45.540 --> 01:17:47.360
<v Speaker 2>what your life is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1764
01:17:47.370 --> 01:17:52.370
<v Speaker 2>and at the core of all that is the self </v>
<v Speaker 2>is you are consciousness,</v>

1765
01:17:53.421 --> 01:17:54.760
<v Speaker 2>whatever that means,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1766
01:17:54.770 --> 01:17:55.603
<v Speaker 2>It's never been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one's ever been able to take </v>

1767
01:17:56.871 --> 01:17:57.704
<v Speaker 2>consciousness and a little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we extracted it and we put in this </v>

1768
01:17:59.691 --> 01:18:01.160
<v Speaker 2>beaker and now we weighed it.</v>

1769
01:18:01.550 --> 01:18:02.383
<v Speaker 2>Consciousness is a 28 grams or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember that stupid thing that people </v>

1770
01:18:06.031 --> 01:18:07.420
<v Speaker 2>always think when you died,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1771
01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:08.513
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twenty,</v>

1772
01:18:08.660 --> 01:18:12.630
<v Speaker 2>21 grams yet 21 grams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what?</v>

1773
01:18:12.830 --> 01:18:17.830
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if that was the case and before </v>
<v Speaker 2>that all happened,</v>

1774
01:18:17.870 --> 01:18:20.490
<v Speaker 2>you went and downloaded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your brain does some super computer,</v>

1775
01:18:20.630 --> 01:18:22.390
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you got to use.</v>

1776
01:18:22.410 --> 01:18:27.180
<v Speaker 2>You got one that lives in hell on earth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>living forever,</v>

1777
01:18:27.260 --> 01:18:31.610
<v Speaker 2>never going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just one mundane trip to starbucks after</v>

1778
01:18:31.611 --> 01:18:35.510
<v Speaker 2>another and you just try it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're trapped in a computer,</v>

1779
01:18:35.511 --> 01:18:40.220
<v Speaker 2>which is what Ray Kurzweil is saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what if like you would if they give</v>

1780
01:18:40.221 --> 01:18:41.900
<v Speaker 2>you the opportunity to be trapped into </v>
<v Speaker 2>computer,</v>

1781
01:18:41.901 --> 01:18:45.530
<v Speaker 2>but you're trapped in an iphone one </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially once you're in,</v>

1782
01:18:45.531 --> 01:18:49.700
<v Speaker 2>you're in like you can either wait and </v>
<v Speaker 2>hang on for a few years and you will get</v>

1783
01:18:49.701 --> 01:18:50.534
<v Speaker 2>a really good computer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're thinking quantum computers are </v>

1784
01:18:53.391 --> 01:18:55.070
<v Speaker 2>going to go live around 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30,</v>

1785
01:18:55.071 --> 01:18:56.180
<v Speaker 2>20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>32,</v>

1786
01:18:56.240 --> 01:18:59.450
<v Speaker 2>but we can get you in now looking </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty.</v>

1787
01:18:59.450 --> 01:19:00.650
<v Speaker 2>You're coughing a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mike.</v>

1788
01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:03.153
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it's like with the cryonics people </v>

1789
01:19:04.660 --> 01:19:06.170
<v Speaker 2>and I remind people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1790
01:19:06.260 --> 01:19:08.390
<v Speaker 2>you're being frozen on the worst day of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your life.</v>

1791
01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:09.300
<v Speaker 2>You know the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1792
01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:13.100
<v Speaker 2>you died and you can't do it earlier </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the state treats it as a form of</v>

1793
01:19:13.101 --> 01:19:14.750
<v Speaker 2>burial legally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can't be,</v>

1794
01:19:14.930 --> 01:19:15.763
<v Speaker 2>you can't get the treatment and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fruit in the injected with the </v>

1795
01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:19.033
<v Speaker 2>antifreeze and all that before you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually dead or how they inject you </v>

1796
01:19:21.201 --> 01:19:23.940
<v Speaker 2>with antifreeze yet type of antifreeze </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1797
01:19:24.210 --> 01:19:27.230
<v Speaker 2>the purpose of that while your dad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it doesn't really matter,</v>

1798
01:19:27.470 --> 01:19:31.280
<v Speaker 2>but the purpose is to keep the cells </v>
<v Speaker 2>from shattering the freezing process.</v>

1799
01:19:31.281 --> 01:19:32.114
<v Speaker 2>We'll do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they've gotten much better about </v>

1800
01:19:33.741 --> 01:19:34.574
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what's actually frozen is this sort </v>

1801
01:19:36.051 --> 01:19:39.130
<v Speaker 2>of gelatinous mass that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's vitrified.</v>

1802
01:19:39.131 --> 01:19:40.910
<v Speaker 2>It's called vitrification process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

1803
01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:42.313
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a little bit like a member of the </v>

1804
01:19:43.461 --> 01:19:44.294
<v Speaker 2>touring the bodies where they had the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dissected bodies and they were sort of </v>

1805
01:19:47.481 --> 01:19:49.400
<v Speaker 2>this hard plastic plasticine.</v>

1806
01:19:49.670 --> 01:19:50.630
<v Speaker 2>The plasticine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1807
01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:52.730
<v Speaker 2>So this vitrification is sorta like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1808
01:19:53.500 --> 01:19:55.930
<v Speaker 2>And then that's frozen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1809
01:19:55.970 --> 01:19:57.590
<v Speaker 2>as far as we need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as I'm concerned,</v>

1810
01:19:57.860 --> 01:19:58.693
<v Speaker 2>everyone frozen to date,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including Ted Williams in his head in </v>

1811
01:20:01.881 --> 01:20:04.010
<v Speaker 2>Arizona,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there will never be brought back.</v>

1812
01:20:04.090 --> 01:20:06.640
<v Speaker 2>Isn't Walt Disney frozen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I trust that.</v>

1813
01:20:06.641 --> 01:20:11.641
<v Speaker 2>Then it turns out they alcor cryonics </v>
<v Speaker 2>foundation opened its doors and released</v>

1814
01:20:12.081 --> 01:20:14.370
<v Speaker 2>a press release the same day Walt Disney</v>
<v Speaker 2>died.</v>

1815
01:20:14.820 --> 01:20:19.100
<v Speaker 2>And these two stories that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1816
01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:22.150
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes sense to Williams.</v>

1817
01:20:22.170 --> 01:20:23.003
<v Speaker 2>One is sad because they didn't have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>money for the whole body's took his </v>

1818
01:20:25.711 --> 01:20:26.544
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

1819
01:20:26.770 --> 01:20:31.260
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It actually isn't that expensive because</v>

1820
01:20:31.261 --> 01:20:34.350
<v Speaker 2>if you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way the way alcor and the other orgs</v>

1821
01:20:34.351 --> 01:20:35.184
<v Speaker 2>do it is you take out an insurance </v>
<v Speaker 2>policy on your life and you make them </v>

1822
01:20:38.131 --> 01:20:41.940
<v Speaker 2>the beneficiary of the insurance policy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you started young,</v>

1823
01:20:41.941 --> 01:20:44.310
<v Speaker 2>you had say a quarter million dollar </v>
<v Speaker 2>insurance policy,</v>

1824
01:20:44.490 --> 01:20:46.500
<v Speaker 2>a few hundred dollars a year in </v>
<v Speaker 2>premiums.</v>

1825
01:20:47.030 --> 01:20:49.290
<v Speaker 2>He started super late.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The premiums would be much higher,</v>

1826
01:20:49.690 --> 01:20:50.523
<v Speaker 2>but it's not like you're shelling out a </v>
<v Speaker 2>quarter million dollars right at your </v>

1827
01:20:52.891 --> 01:20:57.891
<v Speaker 2>checkbook and then when you do die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens if you get defrosted?</v>

1828
01:20:58.260 --> 01:20:59.490
<v Speaker 2>Because that has happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1829
01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:02.610
<v Speaker 2>Having done well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh well what happens is as you look like</v>

1830
01:21:02.620 --> 01:21:05.310
<v Speaker 2>a bowl of melted strawberries that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>frozen,</v>

1831
01:21:05.670 --> 01:21:06.503
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just much that happened to one of </v>

1832
01:21:09.421 --> 01:21:12.030
<v Speaker 2>the companies that does this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had a power outage,</v>

1833
01:21:12.180 --> 01:21:13.620
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1834
01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:15.150
<v Speaker 2>You don't want that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1835
01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:17.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure whether in Alcor is in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Arizona.</v>

1836
01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:19.950
<v Speaker 2>I made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a terrible place.</v>

1837
01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:21.113
<v Speaker 2>Shouldn't they be like in Antarctica and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's other deeper issues with this </v>

1838
01:21:24.451 --> 01:21:27.780
<v Speaker 2>whole idea because if you're going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>frozen for a thousand years or so,</v>

1839
01:21:28.020 --> 01:21:28.853
<v Speaker 2>what's to say that the state of Arizona </v>
<v Speaker 2>is going to be around where the </v>

1840
01:21:30.961 --> 01:21:33.210
<v Speaker 2>government or the company that keeps the</v>
<v Speaker 2>lights on?</v>

1841
01:21:33.210 --> 01:21:34.043
<v Speaker 2>Everything under water or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could anything transport your body and </v>

1842
01:21:38.371 --> 01:21:41.460
<v Speaker 2>some sort of one of the big Ole Electric</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tesla trucks.</v>

1843
01:21:42.050 --> 01:21:44.250
<v Speaker 2>Big Cooler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll send you to Mars.</v>

1844
01:21:44.251 --> 01:21:45.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>send me some new spot.</v>

1845
01:21:46.380 --> 01:21:47.213
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>

1846
01:21:48.450 --> 01:21:49.650
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

1847
01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:50.553
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would,</v>

1848
01:21:50.570 --> 01:21:51.403
<v Speaker 2>if they somehow jumpstarted the body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you wake up like you just had a </v>

1849
01:21:55.141 --> 01:21:56.790
<v Speaker 2>long sleep?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you still be in there?</v>

1850
01:21:57.420 --> 01:22:00.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm not at all sure that you wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>just be something like if they,</v>

1851
01:22:00.230 --> 01:22:02.340
<v Speaker 2>if the memories weren't preserved very </v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1852
01:22:03.150 --> 01:22:07.140
<v Speaker 2>then it would just be a Zombie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't know who you are,</v>

1853
01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:11.610
<v Speaker 2>there's no point in doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the idea is freeze you.</v>

1854
01:22:11.670 --> 01:22:12.503
<v Speaker 2>And then one day they'll have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>technology to throw you out and </v>

1855
01:22:14.311 --> 01:22:15.144
<v Speaker 2>everything's going to be amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there'll be able to reverse aging </v>

1856
01:22:17.131 --> 01:22:19.760
<v Speaker 2>and bring you back to when you're 18.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right,</v>

1857
01:22:19.761 --> 01:22:22.290
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but here's the thing about memories,</v>

1858
01:22:23.250 --> 01:22:27.750
<v Speaker 2>what like if you do die and say if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>do go to heaven,</v>

1859
01:22:28.410 --> 01:22:30.270
<v Speaker 2>you have the memories of your life.</v>

1860
01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:31.873
<v Speaker 2>Are Those memories just like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>memories of today fallible and </v>

1861
01:22:35.650 --> 01:22:37.650
<v Speaker 2>squirreling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1862
01:22:37.670 --> 01:22:39.540
<v Speaker 2>and if they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that's not really you.</v>

1863
01:22:39.990 --> 01:22:40.823
<v Speaker 2>And if God resurrects you physically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's to stop you from aging and </v>

1864
01:22:44.221 --> 01:22:45.720
<v Speaker 2>getting Alzheimer's or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1865
01:22:45.721 --> 01:22:47.940
<v Speaker 2>God's gonna prevent that by </v>
<v Speaker 2>reengineering you.</v>

1866
01:22:47.941 --> 01:22:48.774
<v Speaker 2>Well then that's not really me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's up there at some super human </v>

1867
01:22:51.810 --> 01:22:52.643
<v Speaker 2>transhuman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a conversation with some friends </v>

1868
01:22:54.481 --> 01:22:55.314
<v Speaker 2>of mine who are Mormon and they couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe that I don't have religious </v>

1869
01:22:59.341 --> 01:23:02.790
<v Speaker 2>feelings and one of the things that this</v>
<v Speaker 2>lady said to me,</v>

1870
01:23:02.791 --> 01:23:03.750
<v Speaker 2>I'll never forget,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she goes,</v>

1871
01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:07.660
<v Speaker 2>you don't believe in afterlife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you get up in the morning?</v>

1872
01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:10.900
<v Speaker 2>Literally what she said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you get up?</v>

1873
01:23:11.240 --> 01:23:13.000
<v Speaker 2>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love life here.</v>

1874
01:23:13.540 --> 01:23:14.373
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy this experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am enjoying being here at dinner with </v>

1875
01:23:16.931 --> 01:23:19.330
<v Speaker 2>you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do some stuff tomorrow.</v>

1876
01:23:19.331 --> 01:23:21.100
<v Speaker 2>I've got planned out looking forward to </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1877
01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:23.920
<v Speaker 2>I got like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't you enjoy your time?</v>

1878
01:23:23.921 --> 01:23:24.754
<v Speaker 2>Like does everything have to be for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>reward some place that you're not even </v>

1879
01:23:29.231 --> 01:23:31.960
<v Speaker 2>totally sure exist after we're done </v>
<v Speaker 2>here?</v>

1880
01:23:32.290 --> 01:23:33.123
<v Speaker 2>It's such a weird thing to say because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't think they even think about that </v>

1881
01:23:35.250 --> 01:23:37.930
<v Speaker 2>and I'd get seriously doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She wakes up in the morning goes,</v>

1882
01:23:37.931 --> 01:23:39.430
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's an afterlife.</v>

1883
01:23:39.460 --> 01:23:41.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm feeling good about life and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to get up.</v>

1884
01:23:41.561 --> 01:23:44.740
<v Speaker 2>I doubt it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it alleviates the pressure and I</v>

1885
01:23:44.741 --> 01:23:47.830
<v Speaker 2>think that's a big part of what it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it is for people.</v>

1886
01:23:47.940 --> 01:23:50.740
<v Speaker 2>It.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It alleviates the concern for the future</v>

1887
01:23:50.741 --> 01:23:51.131
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1888
01:23:51.131 --> 01:23:52.660
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to worry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God's got it.</v>

1889
01:23:52.720 --> 01:23:54.110
<v Speaker 2>God's going to take care of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1890
01:23:54.230 --> 01:23:55.063
<v Speaker 2>Everything happens for a reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God's going to take everything does </v>

1891
01:23:57.521 --> 01:23:59.760
<v Speaker 2>happen for a reason after it happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1892
01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:00.491
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1893
01:24:00.491 --> 01:24:01.900
<v Speaker 2>After it's over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can go back and go,</v>

1894
01:24:01.901 --> 01:24:03.010
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it happened for a reason,</v>

1895
01:24:03.100 --> 01:24:05.890
<v Speaker 2>so it became this and that became who I </v>
<v Speaker 2>am.</v>

1896
01:24:05.890 --> 01:24:07.500
<v Speaker 2>So it all happened for a reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

1897
01:24:07.640 --> 01:24:08.830
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1898
01:24:08.950 --> 01:24:09.783
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But of course it usually what they made </v>

1899
01:24:12.391 --> 01:24:14.500
<v Speaker 2>is somebody pulling the strings to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>it happen.</v>

1900
01:24:14.870 --> 01:24:18.250
<v Speaker 2>Not just the pathway that you happen to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have gone down.</v>

1901
01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:19.233
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They always mean that God has some </v>

1902
01:24:20.171 --> 01:24:24.310
<v Speaker 2>grand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very mysterious plan and kind of see how</v>

1903
01:24:24.311 --> 01:24:25.210
<v Speaker 2>that feels good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1904
01:24:25.510 --> 01:24:26.650
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not alone.</v>

1905
01:24:26.651 --> 01:24:27.484
<v Speaker 2>There's somebody watching that after me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just my spouse and my friends and </v>

1906
01:24:30.221 --> 01:24:32.130
<v Speaker 2>family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1907
01:24:32.350 --> 01:24:35.260
<v Speaker 2>somebody out there somewhere and I can </v>
<v Speaker 2>see why that feels good.</v>

1908
01:24:35.530 --> 01:24:37.160
<v Speaker 2>So this is the problem atheists have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1909
01:24:37.430 --> 01:24:38.263
<v Speaker 2>it dot talks about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what do you say to somebody that's </v>

1910
01:24:42.740 --> 01:24:45.220
<v Speaker 2>dying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the Ricky Gervais' movie,</v>

1911
01:24:45.221 --> 01:24:46.320
<v Speaker 2>the invention of line,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1912
01:24:46.321 --> 01:24:48.460
<v Speaker 2>where he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he tells his mom,</v>

1913
01:24:48.461 --> 01:24:49.120
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1914
01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:50.560
<v Speaker 2>you get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get a mansion,</v>

1915
01:24:50.620 --> 01:24:53.470
<v Speaker 2>everyone who dies gets a mansion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a mansion.</v>

1916
01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:54.341
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's great.</v>

1917
01:24:54.341 --> 01:24:57.280
<v Speaker 2>And he goes on and then 10 minutes later</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the movie,</v>

1918
01:24:57.281 --> 01:24:59.290
<v Speaker 2>he's the Messiah because this meme got </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

1919
01:24:59.291 --> 01:25:00.900
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a great story and you know,</v>

1920
01:25:00.950 --> 01:25:02.320
<v Speaker 2>so we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't do that.</v>

1921
01:25:02.430 --> 01:25:04.240
<v Speaker 2>If you're honest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't make up a story.</v>

1922
01:25:04.241 --> 01:25:07.840
<v Speaker 2>So what do you say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in secular humanist circles,</v>

1923
01:25:07.841 --> 01:25:09.940
<v Speaker 2>it was articles about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you say?</v>

1924
01:25:09.941 --> 01:25:11.400
<v Speaker 2>And it's hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1925
01:25:11.401 --> 01:25:12.820
<v Speaker 2>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't promise it,</v>

1926
01:25:12.821 --> 01:25:13.654
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1927
01:25:13.870 --> 01:25:16.210
<v Speaker 2>reminding people of what a great life </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've had,</v>

1928
01:25:16.300 --> 01:25:18.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much they've influenced the lives of</v>

1929
01:25:18.611 --> 01:25:20.170
<v Speaker 2>other people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1930
01:25:20.171 --> 01:25:22.510
<v Speaker 2>and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's really all we have.</v>

1931
01:25:22.580 --> 01:25:23.413
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you used the line from Woody Allen in </v>

1932
01:25:25.331 --> 01:25:25.780
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1933
01:25:25.780 --> 01:25:27.880
<v Speaker 2>who says I don't want to live on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my work I want to live on,</v>

1934
01:25:27.881 --> 01:25:30.460
<v Speaker 2>in my apartment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1935
01:25:30.590 --> 01:25:32.430
<v Speaker 2>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1936
01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:34.120
<v Speaker 2>but we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't get to do that.</v>

1937
01:25:34.270 --> 01:25:35.260
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do not.</v>

1938
01:25:35.290 --> 01:25:38.590
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to go back to what I said earlier</v>

1939
01:25:38.591 --> 01:25:43.540
<v Speaker 2>is that you are enjoying this partially </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's temporary.</v>

1940
01:25:43.900 --> 01:25:48.640
<v Speaker 2>It's part of the thing about a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you don't want to stay up forever,</v>

1941
01:25:48.730 --> 01:25:49.563
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to enjoy the day and then at </v>

1942
01:25:51.911 --> 01:25:52.744
<v Speaker 2>the end it's over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that day is a microcosm of your </v>

1943
01:25:55.001 --> 01:25:56.320
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1944
01:25:56.321 --> 01:25:57.310
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of fun to think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1945
01:25:57.311 --> 01:25:59.020
<v Speaker 2>I got eight hours here before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1946
01:25:59.021 --> 01:26:00.400
<v Speaker 2>it's dinnertime and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so on.</v>

1947
01:26:00.401 --> 01:26:01.234
<v Speaker 2>So I got to get my workout in and I get </v>
<v Speaker 2>to write this and I get to make these </v>

1948
01:26:04.191 --> 01:26:06.210
<v Speaker 2>calls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's kind of fun to kind of see how,</v>

1949
01:26:06.230 --> 01:26:08.420
<v Speaker 2>if you can squeeze it all in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1950
01:26:08.421 --> 01:26:12.290
<v Speaker 2>And knowing that there is a time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it was a 20 hour window,</v>

1951
01:26:12.310 --> 01:26:13.140
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1952
01:26:13.140 --> 01:26:14.750
<v Speaker 2>I just started fucking around and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

1953
01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:16.193
<v Speaker 2>get plenty of times I find I get more </v>
<v Speaker 2>done as a person who's very busy with a </v>

1954
01:26:22.821 --> 01:26:24.920
<v Speaker 2>family and children and all that stuff.</v>

1955
01:26:24.950 --> 01:26:25.783
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I get more done because I </v>

1956
01:26:26.991 --> 01:26:30.680
<v Speaker 2>don't have time to fuck off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I very rarely have time to fuck off.</v>

1957
01:26:30.740 --> 01:26:33.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been distracted the last six months</v>

1958
01:26:33.741 --> 01:26:34.574
<v Speaker 2>or a year or so with a following twitter</v>
<v Speaker 2>feeds that send interesting articles to </v>

1959
01:26:38.361 --> 01:26:40.070
<v Speaker 2>read,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are interesting articles.</v>

1960
01:26:40.071 --> 01:26:42.230
<v Speaker 2>There's a ton of really good content out</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1961
01:26:42.231 --> 01:26:43.890
<v Speaker 2>And then podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your podcast,</v>

1962
01:26:43.891 --> 01:26:46.080
<v Speaker 2>sams and Dave Rubin and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1963
01:26:46.081 --> 01:26:47.480
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>

1964
01:26:47.481 --> 01:26:48.740
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is all good.</v>

1965
01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:50.300
<v Speaker 2>I really want to consume,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but wait a minute,</v>

1966
01:26:50.301 --> 01:26:51.740
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not getting my workout in,</v>

1967
01:26:51.741 --> 01:26:52.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

1968
01:26:52.761 --> 01:26:54.950
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a good problem to have.</v>

1969
01:26:54.951 --> 01:26:56.930
<v Speaker 2>It's a first world problem to have as </v>
<v Speaker 2>they say.</v>

1970
01:26:57.770 --> 01:26:58.603
<v Speaker 2>And I think what the transhumanists and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Ray Kurzweil thank is heaven would </v>

1971
01:27:01.041 --> 01:27:04.990
<v Speaker 2>be something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just endless streams of content that you</v>

1972
01:27:06.610 --> 01:27:08.460
<v Speaker 2>enlist twitter feed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

1973
01:27:09.140 --> 01:27:10.290
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1974
01:27:10.310 --> 01:27:12.270
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be hell yeah.</v>

1975
01:27:12.460 --> 01:27:15.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what he wants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't.</v>

1976
01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:18.590
<v Speaker 2>The living forever thing is very </v>
<v Speaker 2>problematic.</v>

1977
01:27:19.010 --> 01:27:20.240
<v Speaker 2>It's like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are,</v>

1978
01:27:20.241 --> 01:27:22.260
<v Speaker 2>be so outdated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1979
01:27:22.261 --> 01:27:23.000
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1980
01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:24.290
<v Speaker 2>100 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1981
01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:26.240
<v Speaker 2>totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just.</v>

1982
01:27:26.500 --> 01:27:29.420
<v Speaker 2>And the downloading yourself into a </v>
<v Speaker 2>computer thing too.</v>

1983
01:27:29.421 --> 01:27:30.254
<v Speaker 2>What's to stop a guy like Kim Jong wound</v>
<v Speaker 2>from downloading himself 100 times or a </v>

1984
01:27:35.010 --> 01:27:36.780
<v Speaker 2>thousand or do it every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1985
01:27:36.890 --> 01:27:37.723
<v Speaker 2>every day makes a new Kim Jong Il.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is one reason that these cult </v>

1986
01:27:40.101 --> 01:27:40.934
<v Speaker 2>leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do try to do that through lots of </v>

1987
01:27:44.391 --> 01:27:46.130
<v Speaker 2>sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is kind of what they're doing.</v>

1988
01:27:46.131 --> 01:27:46.671
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1989
01:27:46.671 --> 01:27:47.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1990
01:27:47.740 --> 01:27:49.580
<v Speaker 2>Setting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're setting their genes out into the</v>

1991
01:27:49.581 --> 01:27:52.010
<v Speaker 2>future as much as they can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me ask you this then.</v>

1992
01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:55.460
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why does that instinct exist?</v>

1993
01:27:55.950 --> 01:27:58.740
<v Speaker 2>Like is that a purely approcreation </v>
<v Speaker 2>instinct?</v>

1994
01:27:58.760 --> 01:27:59.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

1995
01:27:59.510 --> 01:28:00.343
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you think that's the religious cult </v>

1996
01:28:01.761 --> 01:28:02.594
<v Speaker 2>leader instincts?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's based entirely on some ancient </v>

1997
01:28:04.911 --> 01:28:09.290
<v Speaker 2>reward system that's designed to get you</v>
<v Speaker 2>to gingiss con your jeans out throughout</v>

1998
01:28:09.291 --> 01:28:09.950
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1999
01:28:09.950 --> 01:28:11.400
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2000
01:28:11.401 --> 01:28:12.140
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's A.</v>

2001
01:28:12.140 --> 01:28:14.660
<v Speaker 2>I have a chapter there and why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do we have to die?</v>

2002
01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:15.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

2003
01:28:15.290 --> 01:28:18.400
<v Speaker 2>Why can't we just be programmed like </v>
<v Speaker 2>infants are and babies,</v>

2004
01:28:18.460 --> 01:28:19.293
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cells divide rapidly and they're </v>

2005
01:28:20.901 --> 01:28:23.420
<v Speaker 2>super healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a young son now,</v>

2006
01:28:23.421 --> 01:28:24.440
<v Speaker 2>he's 20 months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2007
01:28:24.441 --> 01:28:26.600
<v Speaker 2>when he gets a little cut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could practically watch it heal.</v>

2008
01:28:26.601 --> 01:28:27.434
<v Speaker 2>It's just incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yet when I get a cut at 63 and it </v>

2009
01:28:29.751 --> 01:28:30.980
<v Speaker 2>takes a couple of weeks to heal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

2010
01:28:30.981 --> 01:28:32.990
<v Speaker 2>why can't I?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can't the system keep going?</v>

2011
01:28:33.620 --> 01:28:35.330
<v Speaker 2>And the answer is twofold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And second,</v>

2012
01:28:35.331 --> 01:28:36.800
<v Speaker 2>law of thermodynamics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>entropy,</v>

2013
01:28:36.870 --> 01:28:37.703
<v Speaker 2>everything is running down and second </v>
<v Speaker 2>natural selection programmed us to stay </v>

2014
01:28:40.581 --> 01:28:41.414
<v Speaker 2>alive long enough to keep it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get our children's children into the </v>

2015
01:28:43.971 --> 01:28:45.950
<v Speaker 2>reproductive age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>After that,</v>

2016
01:28:46.610 --> 01:28:51.200
<v Speaker 2>given that we have limited resources and</v>
<v Speaker 2>energy in the system we live in,</v>

2017
01:28:51.710 --> 01:28:55.160
<v Speaker 2>it's better to allocate the resources to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the third generation say,</v>

2018
01:28:55.161 --> 01:28:57.320
<v Speaker 2>rather than you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't need to live 150,</v>

2019
01:28:57.321 --> 01:28:58.790
<v Speaker 2>200 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>60,</v>

2020
01:28:58.791 --> 01:29:02.130
<v Speaker 2>70 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your children's children are now in</v>

2021
01:29:02.130 --> 01:29:04.620
<v Speaker 1>their early twenties and having babies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're done.</v>

2022
01:29:05.220 --> 01:29:07.070
<v Speaker 1>As far as natural selection is </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned.</v>

2023
01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:07.913
<v Speaker 1>Now I say it in a way like there's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>czar of the secretary of the treasury </v>

2024
01:29:11.971 --> 01:29:13.860
<v Speaker 1>that's allocating resources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2025
01:29:13.980 --> 01:29:16.260
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just natural selection.</v>

2026
01:29:16.530 --> 01:29:21.070
<v Speaker 1>Selecting things for whatever's best for</v>
<v Speaker 1>survival to get genes into the,</v>

2027
01:29:21.400 --> 01:29:22.233
<v Speaker 1>into the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is Dawkins' argument in the </v>

2028
01:29:24.361 --> 01:29:27.390
<v Speaker 1>selfish gene that that the gene is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

2029
01:29:27.391 --> 01:29:29.610
<v Speaker 1>This is the thing we should be focused </v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

2030
01:29:29.611 --> 01:29:30.444
<v Speaker 1>not the body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That natural selection kind of operates </v>

2031
01:29:32.731 --> 01:29:33.564
<v Speaker 1>on the body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the phenotype that that gets expressed </v>

2032
01:29:35.550 --> 01:29:36.383
<v Speaker 1>in a physical body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the body's are just survival </v>

2033
01:29:39.031 --> 01:29:42.210
<v Speaker 1>machines that the replicators build to </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep going.</v>

2034
01:29:42.750 --> 01:29:46.140
<v Speaker 1>So the replicators are immortal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The species is a mortal.</v>

2035
01:29:46.141 --> 01:29:47.700
<v Speaker 1>In a sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our genome is a moral.</v>

2036
01:29:47.701 --> 01:29:50.730
<v Speaker 1>That's why toxins called that river out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Eden.</v>

2037
01:29:51.420 --> 01:29:52.253
<v Speaker 1>One of his book title that says that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>river out of Eden is eternal as long as </v>

2038
01:29:56.101 --> 01:29:57.750
<v Speaker 1>our species doesn't go extinct.</v>

2039
01:29:58.150 --> 01:29:58.600
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

2040
01:29:58.600 --> 01:30:01.460
<v Speaker 1>we live forever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you and I as a,</v>

2041
01:30:01.470 --> 01:30:05.880
<v Speaker 1>as just survival machines were just the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gene's way of keeping itself to the next</v>

2042
01:30:05.881 --> 01:30:08.820
<v Speaker 1>generation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're really only good for maybe 60,</v>

2043
01:30:08.821 --> 01:30:11.890
<v Speaker 1>70 years for a human timescale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2044
01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:14.040
<v Speaker 1>your kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids get to survival age,</v>

2045
01:30:14.070 --> 01:30:17.700
<v Speaker 1>you're done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is the problem of that.</v>

2046
01:30:17.701 --> 01:30:21.660
<v Speaker 1>All the radical life extension has had </v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole system starts to fall apart at</v>

2047
01:30:21.720 --> 01:30:24.060
<v Speaker 1>around the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like mid to late eighties.</v>

2048
01:30:24.061 --> 01:30:24.894
<v Speaker 1>Things start falling apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can make it into your nineties </v>

2049
01:30:27.241 --> 01:30:29.310
<v Speaker 1>and you're still reasonably healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really good.</v>

2050
01:30:29.730 --> 01:30:32.450
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you had Mel Gibson and his doc on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2051
01:30:32.451 --> 01:30:33.284
<v Speaker 1>with the stem cells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff is only going to push </v>

2052
01:30:35.401 --> 01:30:38.290
<v Speaker 1>this further further more of us to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>upper ceiling.</v>

2053
01:30:38.950 --> 01:30:39.783
<v Speaker 1>We're not going to break through that </v>
<v Speaker 1>upper sending about 120 without </v>

2054
01:30:41.681 --> 01:30:44.520
<v Speaker 1>something hugely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely re-engineered.</v>

2055
01:30:44.550 --> 01:30:45.383
<v Speaker 1>There may be a crisper technology that </v>
<v Speaker 1>re engineered the genome to stop all </v>

2056
01:30:49.031 --> 01:30:50.420
<v Speaker 1>this stuff from happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

2057
01:30:50.620 --> 01:30:51.453
<v Speaker 1>we have 4 billion years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well three and a half billion years or </v>

2058
01:30:53.141 --> 01:30:53.974
<v Speaker 1>so of life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that continuity of the genome and </v>

2059
01:30:58.331 --> 01:31:00.970
<v Speaker 1>it's all built into there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And every single system,</v>

2060
01:31:00.971 --> 01:31:02.650
<v Speaker 1>every cell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all parts of your yourself,</v>

2061
01:31:02.680 --> 01:31:05.980
<v Speaker 1>they're all going to age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

2062
01:31:06.060 --> 01:31:08.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people like Aubrey de grey,</v>

2063
01:31:08.230 --> 01:31:09.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got that long.</v>

2064
01:31:09.880 --> 01:31:10.361
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2065
01:31:10.361 --> 01:31:12.850
<v Speaker 1>He's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love this guy and I love that.</v>

2066
01:31:12.860 --> 01:31:13.693
<v Speaker 1>That beer is his favorite thing that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinks is going to be part of the </v>

2067
01:31:15.701 --> 01:31:16.460
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2068
01:31:16.460 --> 01:31:19.650
<v Speaker 1>I'll have a few beers if this is going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to help and even if it.</v>

2069
01:31:20.090 --> 01:31:20.923
<v Speaker 2>That's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2070
01:31:20.940 --> 01:31:23.450
<v Speaker 2>That was one of the things that may be </v>
<v Speaker 2>most skeptical of him.</v>

2071
01:31:24.010 --> 01:31:29.010
<v Speaker 2>It was at the beer that's an amino </v>
<v Speaker 2>suppressant drinking poison.</v>

2072
01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:31.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a mild poison.</v>

2073
01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:32.273
<v Speaker 2>That's delicious model.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not good to drink this shit all </v>

2074
01:31:35.631 --> 01:31:36.830
<v Speaker 2>day long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2075
01:31:36.831 --> 01:31:37.664
<v Speaker 2>this is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was talking to somebody that </v>

2076
01:31:38.711 --> 01:31:40.700
<v Speaker 2>interviewed him and said he was clearly </v>
<v Speaker 2>drunk,</v>

2077
01:31:41.190 --> 01:31:42.320
<v Speaker 2>like I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>

2078
01:31:42.321 --> 01:31:42.981
<v Speaker 2>And she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2079
01:31:42.981 --> 01:31:43.814
<v Speaker 2>I interviewed him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was drunk drinking beer and he was </v>

2080
01:31:45.951 --> 01:31:47.840
<v Speaker 2>drunk and she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it wasn't.</v>

2081
01:31:47.930 --> 01:31:52.370
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't late in the day either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Started started is just gets hammered.</v>

2082
01:31:52.371 --> 01:31:54.980
<v Speaker 2>Does Science Fountain of Youth Very </v>
<v Speaker 2>early?</v>

2083
01:31:55.770 --> 01:31:57.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a fascinating guy too,</v>

2084
01:31:57.440 --> 01:31:59.800
<v Speaker 2>because he's not really much for </v>
<v Speaker 2>exercise either.</v>

2085
01:32:00.340 --> 01:32:03.070
<v Speaker 2>Now a nutrition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of these guys that are into this,</v>

2086
01:32:03.071 --> 01:32:03.700
<v Speaker 2>they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>

2087
01:32:03.700 --> 01:32:04.720
<v Speaker 2>they don't look healthy.</v>

2088
01:32:04.750 --> 01:32:06.060
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2089
01:32:06.130 --> 01:32:06.963
<v Speaker 2>It's the one thing we know for sure in </v>
<v Speaker 2>terms of longevity to get you closer to </v>

2090
01:32:10.901 --> 01:32:12.910
<v Speaker 2>the upper ceiling and more of is don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>smoke.</v>

2091
01:32:12.911 --> 01:32:15.190
<v Speaker 2>Don't drink too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exercise every day.</v>

2092
01:32:15.191 --> 01:32:17.100

<v Speaker 2>know that.</v>

2096
01:32:22.121 --> 01:32:24.940
<v Speaker 2>Meat and eggs and butter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is all okay now.</v>

2097
01:32:24.941 --> 01:32:25.774
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it always felt like this was a </v>

2098
01:32:28.090 --> 01:32:31.260
<v Speaker 2>balance with the salads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Salads are good too.</v>

2099
01:32:31.430 --> 01:32:33.520
<v Speaker 2>What's good?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's not good?</v>

2100
01:32:33.550 --> 01:32:36.580
<v Speaker 2>Sugar is the devil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the worst.</v>

2101
01:32:36.640 --> 01:32:38.770
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's amazing how.</v>

2102
01:32:38.830 --> 01:32:41.890
<v Speaker 2>Now I love listening to your podcasts </v>
<v Speaker 2>with Nina Teicholz.</v>

2103
01:32:41.910 --> 01:32:42.430
<v Speaker 2>Tie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shoulds.</v>

2104
01:32:42.430 --> 01:32:44.740
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I totally related to the,</v>

2105
01:32:44.741 --> 01:32:45.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went through my.</v>

2106
01:32:45.881 --> 01:32:50.800
<v Speaker 2>No meat stage and I just eat down in </v>
<v Speaker 2>these huge bowls of quaker Granola,</v>

2107
01:32:51.370 --> 01:32:55.470
<v Speaker 2>which is incredibly addictive because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sugar and this.</v>

2108
01:32:55.640 --> 01:32:59.170
<v Speaker 2>I was cycling a lot and I wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not only was I not losing weight,</v>

2109
01:32:59.171 --> 01:33:02.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm putting weight on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to like carrying around this extra</v>

2110
01:33:02.081 --> 01:33:04.480
<v Speaker 2>10 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm eating granola.</v>

2111
01:33:04.510 --> 01:33:06.940
<v Speaker 2>It's healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2112
01:33:07.990 --> 01:33:08.823
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially the Granola that most people </v>

2113
01:33:10.001 --> 01:33:12.250
<v Speaker 2>bothered us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sugar just laced all over it.</v>

2114
01:33:12.251 --> 01:33:12.971
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2115
01:33:12.971 --> 01:33:15.880
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people that eat things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they think are healthy.</v>

2116
01:33:16.030 --> 01:33:18.520
<v Speaker 2>There's this great bread that my wife </v>
<v Speaker 2>brought home.</v>

2117
01:33:18.580 --> 01:33:21.790
<v Speaker 2>It was like a dave's super bread or some</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit like that.</v>

2118
01:33:21.791 --> 01:33:24.460
<v Speaker 2>I forget what it's called,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I bit into it and I was like,</v>

2119
01:33:24.461 --> 01:33:26.950
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is cake.</v>

2120
01:33:27.270 --> 01:33:28.900
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This might as well be cake.</v>

2121
01:33:28.901 --> 01:33:31.750
<v Speaker 2>And then I looked at it and there's like</v>
<v Speaker 2>massive amounts of sugar.</v>

2122
01:33:31.780 --> 01:33:33.110
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2123
01:33:33.220 --> 01:33:34.053
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even realize how much sugar is </v>

2124
01:33:36.221 --> 01:33:38.620
<v Speaker 2>in bread till my wife's from Cologne,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Germany,</v>

2125
01:33:38.621 --> 01:33:39.431
<v Speaker 2>Jennifer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

2126
01:33:39.431 --> 01:33:41.350
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have real bread in Germany.</v>

2127
01:33:41.620 --> 01:33:44.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean you pick up a loaf of bread,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like four pounds.</v>

2128
01:33:44.051 --> 01:33:44.884
<v Speaker 2>It's like a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lead because it's got nuts and it's </v>

2129
01:33:47.051 --> 01:33:51.010
<v Speaker 2>super heavy and rich and there's no </v>
<v Speaker 2>sugar and it tastes very different,</v>

2130
01:33:51.011 --> 01:33:53.140
<v Speaker 2>but once you get used to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's way better.</v>

2131
01:33:53.380 --> 01:33:54.213
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also they're dealing with heirloom </v>

2132
01:33:55.541 --> 01:33:56.374
<v Speaker 2>wheat in most of the European countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we've done from I guess the early </v>

2133
01:34:00.611 --> 01:34:04.780
<v Speaker 2>19 hundreds of slowly change what we </v>
<v Speaker 2>used to be into.</v>

2134
01:34:05.590 --> 01:34:09.250
<v Speaker 2>My friend Maynard explained it to me </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he has a restaurant and he get.</v>

2135
01:34:09.300 --> 01:34:10.133
<v Speaker 2>They grow pasta that's from heirloom </v>
<v Speaker 2>wheat and he said that the wheat that </v>

2136
01:34:14.291 --> 01:34:18.040
<v Speaker 2>you're getting today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have the same amount of acres.</v>

2137
01:34:18.041 --> 01:34:21.310
<v Speaker 2>You get a much higher yield is a bigger </v>
<v Speaker 2>plant.</v>

2138
01:34:21.340 --> 01:34:22.173
<v Speaker 2>It's a big fluffy thing and it also has </v>
<v Speaker 2>much more complex gluten's in it so </v>

2139
01:34:26.291 --> 01:34:28.510
<v Speaker 2>people have more of an issue digesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2140
01:34:28.780 --> 01:34:29.613
<v Speaker 2>You're getting like a lot more gluten </v>
<v Speaker 2>insensitivity today than we've ever had </v>

2141
01:34:34.121 --> 01:34:37.840
<v Speaker 2>before and that's all because of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>manipulated wheat.</v>

2142
01:34:38.180 --> 01:34:39.013
<v Speaker 2>So we started buying pasta from Italy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can get heirloom pasta that's grown </v>

2143
01:34:44.471 --> 01:34:46.480
<v Speaker 2>in Europe and it just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It tastes different.</v>

2144
01:34:46.481 --> 01:34:47.314
<v Speaker 2>It makes you feel different when you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't feel like a brick in your </v>

2145
01:34:49.421 --> 01:34:50.161
<v Speaker 2>stomach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2146
01:34:50.161 --> 01:34:51.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's still pasta.</v>

2147
01:34:51.311 --> 01:34:52.660
<v Speaker 2>It's still carbohydrates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2148
01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:53.553
<v Speaker 2>it's not the best stuff for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's certainly better and it gives </v>

2149
01:34:56.321 --> 01:34:58.070
<v Speaker 2>your body a better or feeling,</v>

2150
01:34:58.100 --> 01:34:59.150
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

2151
01:34:59.390 --> 01:35:01.280
<v Speaker 3>Bread without sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pasta without sugar.</v>

2152
01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:02.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well you're going to get some.</v>

2153
01:35:02.750 --> 01:35:03.531
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

2154
01:35:03.531 --> 01:35:04.730
<v Speaker 3>it's different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2155
01:35:04.760 --> 01:35:07.400
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bread like bread is just bread.</v>

2156
01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:08.450
<v Speaker 3>It's not good for you.</v>

2157
01:35:08.690 --> 01:35:09.523
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that story from Gary Tubbs that </v>

2158
01:35:11.061 --> 01:35:11.571
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2159
01:35:11.571 --> 01:35:12.660
<v Speaker 1>when they started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2160
01:35:13.100 --> 01:35:14.830
<v Speaker 1>taking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2161
01:35:15.350 --> 01:35:19.040
<v Speaker 1>when they started making the transition </v>
<v Speaker 1>from eating meat to eating carbohydrates</v>

2162
01:35:19.430 --> 01:35:20.263
<v Speaker 1>and it tasted like crap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like people don't want to eat </v>

2163
01:35:22.641 --> 01:35:23.474
<v Speaker 1>cardboard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we got to put something in there to </v>

2164
01:35:24.321 --> 01:35:25.550
<v Speaker 1>make it taste good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sugar.</v>

2165
01:35:25.660 --> 01:35:26.493
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

2166
01:35:26.510 --> 01:35:27.800
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2167
01:35:27.830 --> 01:35:28.663
<v Speaker 1>That was like 19 sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>late fifties after Eisenhower had his </v>

2168
01:35:30.831 --> 01:35:31.664
<v Speaker 1>heart attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that whole meme of the dietary </v>

2169
01:35:34.191 --> 01:35:37.610
<v Speaker 1>fat equals a cardiovascular heart </v>
<v Speaker 1>disease.</v>

2170
01:35:37.611 --> 01:35:38.430
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2171
01:35:38.430 --> 01:35:39.263
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you read the New York Times </v>

2172
01:35:39.901 --> 01:35:40.734
<v Speaker 3>article about how the sugar industry </v>
<v Speaker 3>bribe scientists to say that sugar was </v>

2173
01:35:44.491 --> 01:35:47.430
<v Speaker 3>the issue with heart disease and to take</v>
<v Speaker 3>the blame,</v>

2174
01:35:47.490 --> 01:35:48.323
<v Speaker 3>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to take the blame off sugar and put the </v>

2175
01:35:50.281 --> 01:35:53.490
<v Speaker 3>blame on saturated fat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's stunning.</v>

2176
01:35:53.520 --> 01:35:54.353
<v Speaker 3>It's stunning how many people to this </v>
<v Speaker 3>day will just parrot that back and the </v>

2177
01:35:58.090 --> 01:36:00.510
<v Speaker 3>fact that saturated fat is terrible for </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2178
01:36:00.511 --> 01:36:01.920
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like meanwhile,</v>

2179
01:36:01.921 --> 01:36:04.050
<v Speaker 3>it's no cholesterol terrible for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2180
01:36:04.051 --> 01:36:06.450
<v Speaker 3>it's actually the building blocks for </v>
<v Speaker 3>hormones,</v>

2181
01:36:06.451 --> 01:36:07.284
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's literally the substrate for </v>

2182
01:36:09.061 --> 01:36:10.040
<v Speaker 3>hormones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2183
01:36:10.200 --> 01:36:12.600
<v Speaker 3>That's what your body is made of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cell,</v>

2184
01:36:12.630 --> 01:36:15.450
<v Speaker 3>the cell walls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or you need cholesterol to build those.</v>

2185
01:36:15.870 --> 01:36:16.830
<v Speaker 3>Say that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The people that like,</v>

2186
01:36:16.831 --> 01:36:18.990
<v Speaker 3>what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're crazy.</v>

2187
01:36:19.540 --> 01:36:21.990
<v Speaker 3>Less going to kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to kill you.</v>

2188
01:36:21.991 --> 01:36:23.280
<v Speaker 3>Michael Shermer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2189
01:36:23.410 --> 01:36:24.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2190
01:36:24.570 --> 01:36:26.430
<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nina's book is excellent,</v>

2191
01:36:26.550 --> 01:36:28.170
<v Speaker 3>and then there's quite a few books.</v>

2192
01:36:28.170 --> 01:36:30.150
<v Speaker 3>Gary Tobbs book is excellent as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

2193
01:36:30.870 --> 01:36:31.703
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of people now that are </v>

2194
01:36:32.551 --> 01:36:34.400
<v Speaker 3>shifting their diet over to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know me,</v>

2195
01:36:34.420 --> 01:36:39.090
<v Speaker 3>you can call it Paleo or Marxists and </v>
<v Speaker 3>calls it primal primal blueprint.</v>

2196
01:36:39.810 --> 01:36:44.280
<v Speaker 3>Essentially just eating vegetables and </v>
<v Speaker 3>fish and meat and eating healthy things,</v>

2197
01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:47.460
<v Speaker 3>eating Avocados and coconut oil and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

2198
01:36:47.461 --> 01:36:50.220
<v Speaker 3>and healthy fats and that's what your </v>
<v Speaker 3>body craves.</v>

2199
01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:51.690
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And once you get used to it,</v>

2200
01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:52.553
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that's incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 3>beneficial is I tell people I don't get </v>

2201
01:36:55.561 --> 01:36:57.120
<v Speaker 3>hungry during the day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like most people,</v>

2202
01:36:57.540 --> 01:36:58.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm not starving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2203
01:36:58.940 --> 01:37:00.930
<v Speaker 3>And I don't crash,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I don't need an,</v>

2204
01:37:00.950 --> 01:37:02.090
<v Speaker 3>I don't need naps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what,</v>

2205
01:37:02.170 --> 01:37:04.230
<v Speaker 3>what do you have for breakfast or before</v>
<v Speaker 3>you eat?</v>

2206
01:37:04.231 --> 01:37:05.064
<v Speaker 3>Before a workout or after I eat after a </v>
<v Speaker 3>workout when I like to do is fasted </v>

2207
01:37:08.550 --> 01:37:11.550
<v Speaker 3>cardio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Usually run in the morning or do yoga in</v>

2208
01:37:11.551 --> 01:37:14.310
<v Speaker 3>the morning with no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no food in my stomach.</v>

2209
01:37:14.400 --> 01:37:18.370
<v Speaker 3>So it's like 11 or 12 before you eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or I had eggs and eggs for breakfast.</v>

2210
01:37:18.670 --> 01:37:21.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Avocado and um,</v>

2211
01:37:21.410 --> 01:37:22.243
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like last night I had steak and I'm an </v>

2212
01:37:24.151 --> 01:37:24.984
<v Speaker 3>avocado.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm eating mostly that'll hold you </v>

2213
01:37:26.881 --> 01:37:30.330
<v Speaker 3>through the workout about 10 or 11 in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the morning and I'm fine now.</v>

2214
01:37:30.331 --> 01:37:33.480
<v Speaker 3>What we have after a workout,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2215
01:37:33.510 --> 01:37:35.610
<v Speaker 3>depends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe a protein shake.</v>

2216
01:37:35.870 --> 01:37:39.930
<v Speaker 3>I'm really depends entirely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Today haven't worked out yet.</v>

2217
01:37:39.931 --> 01:37:41.690
<v Speaker 3>So I just had breakfast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

2218
01:37:42.180 --> 01:37:44.820
<v Speaker 3>but most of what I'm eating is whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>foods,</v>

2219
01:37:45.020 --> 01:37:48.570
<v Speaker 3>healthy whole foods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd still eat plenty of salad.</v>

2220
01:37:48.571 --> 01:37:49.404
<v Speaker 3>I still yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I very rarely I'll indulge and </v>

2221
01:37:52.261 --> 01:37:54.480
<v Speaker 3>carbohydrates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I had a cheeseburger from five guys</v>

2222
01:37:54.481 --> 01:37:55.314
<v Speaker 3>on Sunday.</v>

2223
01:37:56.580 --> 01:37:59.770
<v Speaker 1>Every now and then I'll dive in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

2224
01:37:59.820 --> 01:38:01.560
<v Speaker 1>I think if you're working out a lot you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can.</v>

2225
01:38:01.850 --> 01:38:03.420
<v Speaker 1>He can tolerate a little bit more of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2226
01:38:03.780 --> 01:38:05.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just give yourself a little cheat day.</v>

2227
01:38:05.341 --> 01:38:07.290
<v Speaker 1>You feel better about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't feel.</v>

2228
01:38:07.550 --> 01:38:09.870
<v Speaker 1>You feel like you're constantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>depriving yourself.</v>

2229
01:38:09.900 --> 01:38:12.840
<v Speaker 1>But overall I feel great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2230
01:38:12.841 --> 01:38:16.380
<v Speaker 1>We do some long three hour bike rides up</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Santa Barbara where I live now.</v>

2231
01:38:16.381 --> 01:38:19.200
<v Speaker 1>There's a group at pretty seriously </v>
<v Speaker 1>effected by.</v>

2232
01:38:19.370 --> 01:38:19.730
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2233
01:38:19.730 --> 01:38:21.730
<v Speaker 1>I was just north of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The firearms.</v>

2234
01:38:21.870 --> 01:38:23.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I was trapped there,</v>

2235
01:38:23.401 --> 01:38:24.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like being on an island.</v>

2236
01:38:25.380 --> 01:38:28.740
<v Speaker 1>The only way out is to go five hours </v>
<v Speaker 1>north and around to get to La.</v>

2237
01:38:28.860 --> 01:38:29.693
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2238
01:38:29.700 --> 01:38:30.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2239
01:38:31.220 --> 01:38:32.053
<v Speaker 1>For about three weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only way to get to La is you had to </v>

2240
01:38:33.481 --> 01:38:34.314
<v Speaker 1>go up to Santa Maria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take the one 66 over the five year </v>

2241
01:38:36.390 --> 01:38:40.200
<v Speaker 1>practically in Bakersfield and then five</v>
<v Speaker 1>south to la.</v>

2242
01:38:40.230 --> 01:38:41.000
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2243
01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:44.220
<v Speaker 1>So the one on one was shut down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely shut down and all that.</v>

2244
01:38:44.250 --> 01:38:48.660
<v Speaker 1>There's only like a feud side roads that</v>
<v Speaker 1>parallel and they were all close because</v>

2245
01:38:48.661 --> 01:38:51.650
<v Speaker 1>they were covered in mud and also all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the trucks and um,</v>

2246
01:38:51.780 --> 01:38:52.613
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and equipment that construction </v>

2247
01:38:53.791 --> 01:38:58.080
<v Speaker 1>equipment to get the mud out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just opened it to a Sunday night.</v>

2248
01:38:58.300 --> 01:38:59.133
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for awhile they had fairies at a </v>

2249
01:39:01.261 --> 01:39:06.060
<v Speaker 1>ferry from Santa Barbara to Ventura.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course you take the ferry Ventura,</v>

2250
01:39:06.061 --> 01:39:07.400
<v Speaker 1>then you don't have a car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you know,</v>

2251
01:39:07.560 --> 01:39:10.050
<v Speaker 1>you get an uber to la or something </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>

2252
01:39:11.320 --> 01:39:16.320
<v Speaker 1>Mud slides were insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>CDOT Oprah,</v>

2253
01:39:17.130 --> 01:39:18.900
<v Speaker 1>Oprah was there the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think she must've.</v>

2254
01:39:18.930 --> 01:39:20.470
<v Speaker 1>Helicopter didn't obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

2255
01:39:20.471 --> 01:39:24.020
<v Speaker 1>Mr. House by like 50 feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

2256
01:39:24.300 --> 01:39:27.480
<v Speaker 1>Oprah is their magic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We may have injured.</v>

2257
01:39:27.481 --> 01:39:28.314
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we may have another western White House </v>

2258
01:39:29.551 --> 01:39:30.384
<v Speaker 1>in Santa Barbara,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Reagan ranch where he had his </v>

2259
01:39:33.841 --> 01:39:35.700
<v Speaker 1>western White House houses north of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Santa Barbara.</v>

2260
01:39:35.740 --> 01:39:38.010
<v Speaker 1>You think Oprah is going to win?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's going to run for president.</v>

2261
01:39:38.040 --> 01:39:39.660
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if she's going to run,</v>

2262
01:39:39.661 --> 01:39:41.610
<v Speaker 1>but I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The world we live in now.</v>

2263
01:39:41.670 --> 01:39:42.810
<v Speaker 1>She could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you think so.</v>

2264
01:39:42.870 --> 01:39:44.700
<v Speaker 1>She's a pretty good speaker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's not bad.</v>

2265
01:39:44.820 --> 01:39:45.890
<v Speaker 1>She's a good speaker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2266
01:39:46.260 --> 01:39:47.580
<v Speaker 1>This is what I always bring up with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Oprah.</v>

2267
01:39:47.610 --> 01:39:50.550
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember when Oprah was a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>supporter of the secret?</v>

2268
01:39:51.090 --> 01:39:51.721
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally.</v>

2269
01:39:51.721 --> 01:39:52.554
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know we've debunked her stuff because </v>

2270
01:39:53.431 --> 01:39:58.090
<v Speaker 1>she's always open to woo woo stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was super open to that.</v>

2271
01:39:58.200 --> 01:39:59.940
<v Speaker 1>She was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we did the calculation.</v>

2272
01:39:59.941 --> 01:40:01.740
<v Speaker 1>She was like 50 then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2273
01:40:01.770 --> 01:40:04.890
<v Speaker 1>She wasn't a young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dumb kid and didn't know any better.</v>

2274
01:40:05.340 --> 01:40:06.450
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2275
01:40:06.451 --> 01:40:06.931
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2276
01:40:06.931 --> 01:40:10.910
<v Speaker 1>she's a living testimony to what you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>do if you put your mind to it,</v>

2277
01:40:10.911 --> 01:40:12.600
<v Speaker 1>you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>use your intelligence and hard work.</v>

2278
01:40:13.460 --> 01:40:17.610
<v Speaker 1>And she had a television show that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>fun to watch and it was great for women.</v>

2279
01:40:17.940 --> 01:40:22.010
<v Speaker 1>It was like she sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she filled a niche that wasn't,</v>

2280
01:40:22.200 --> 01:40:23.550
<v Speaker 1>wasn't filled before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2281
01:40:24.330 --> 01:40:24.961
<v Speaker 1>there's some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2282
01:40:24.961 --> 01:40:25.794
<v Speaker 1>So we have to make a distinction between</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kinds of things that say a Tony </v>

2283
01:40:30.060 --> 01:40:32.130
<v Speaker 1>Robbins or maybe even a Jordan Peterson </v>
<v Speaker 1>would say,</v>

2284
01:40:32.131 --> 01:40:32.531
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

2285
01:40:32.531 --> 01:40:35.400
<v Speaker 1>here are some things you could do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that'll help you be more successful,</v>

2286
01:40:35.401 --> 01:40:36.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>set your goals,</v>

2287
01:40:36.631 --> 01:40:39.510
<v Speaker 1>write them down every morning when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get up,</v>

2288
01:40:39.511 --> 01:40:40.590
<v Speaker 1>you have a plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2289
01:40:40.591 --> 01:40:43.290
<v Speaker 1>like Jocko says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have your running your workout</v>

2290
01:40:43.291 --> 01:40:45.840
<v Speaker 1>clothes ready to go so you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>fumbling around and give up,</v>

2291
01:40:46.180 --> 01:40:47.013
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like you're betting on your </v>

2292
01:40:48.181 --> 01:40:50.340
<v Speaker 1>future self.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know this is what I'm going to be like</v>

2293
01:40:50.341 --> 01:40:51.930
<v Speaker 1>in 12 hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to do something now.</v>

2294
01:40:52.260 --> 01:40:53.970
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2295
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:55.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Jordan has his book.</v>

2296
01:40:55.270 --> 01:40:58.540
<v Speaker 2>Here's the 12 things you gotta do to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

2297
01:40:58.600 --> 01:40:59.590
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be successful.</v>

2298
01:40:59.591 --> 01:41:00.790
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2299
01:41:00.791 --> 01:41:01.571
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oprah Kinda,</v>

2300
01:41:01.571 --> 01:41:04.180
<v Speaker 2>I think did those things intuitively </v>
<v Speaker 2>just as a,</v>

2301
01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:05.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just what she did.</v>

2302
01:41:05.141 --> 01:41:08.260
<v Speaker 2>That's how she became successful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which has nothing to do with.</v>

2303
01:41:08.261 --> 01:41:11.230
<v Speaker 2>If I tell the universe I want a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Lamborghini,</v>

2304
01:41:11.231 --> 01:41:13.830
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of up here in my driveway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2305
01:41:13.840 --> 01:41:14.840
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the,</v>

2306
01:41:14.950 --> 01:41:15.783
<v Speaker 2>the other deeper problem with that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>that this implies that what if I'm not </v>

2307
01:41:19.691 --> 01:41:21.370
<v Speaker 2>successful?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just weren't thinking positive.</v>

2308
01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:24.400
<v Speaker 2>You mean these poor people in Somalia or</v>
<v Speaker 2>even worse.</v>

2309
01:41:24.401 --> 01:41:27.250
<v Speaker 2>What about children with the disease?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they thinking,</v>

2310
01:41:27.260 --> 01:41:27.831
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2311
01:41:27.831 --> 01:41:28.650
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's no good.</v>

2312
01:41:28.650 --> 01:41:29.483
<v Speaker 2>So the idea that you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your entire existence is based entirely </v>

2313
01:41:32.561 --> 01:41:35.230
<v Speaker 2>inside of your own imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just preposterous.</v>

2314
01:41:35.620 --> 01:41:38.080
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of random shit that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on in this world.</v>

2315
01:41:38.500 --> 01:41:40.330
<v Speaker 2>Some parts of the world get hit by </v>
<v Speaker 2>meteors.</v>

2316
01:41:40.331 --> 01:41:41.860
<v Speaker 2>Were they bad people there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2317
01:41:42.010 --> 01:41:42.611
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how come?</v>

2318
01:41:42.611 --> 01:41:43.444
<v Speaker 2>How come Putin didn't get hit by a </v>
<v Speaker 2>meteor assassinating rivals and god is </v>

2319
01:41:50.380 --> 01:41:51.213
<v Speaker 2>still a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just a lot of people out there </v>

2320
01:41:52.481 --> 01:41:55.450
<v Speaker 2>that are terrible people that just state</v>
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>

2321
01:41:55.480 --> 01:41:57.790
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somehow or another problem of evil.</v>

2322
01:41:57.850 --> 01:42:00.730
<v Speaker 2>Why do bad things happen to good people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And good things happen to bad?</v>

2323
01:42:00.750 --> 01:42:02.040
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2324
01:42:02.430 --> 01:42:03.263
<v Speaker 2>The problem with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the secret is that if you're successful </v>

2325
01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:08.673
<v Speaker 2>and you know you have this story of I </v>
<v Speaker 2>just imagined it and I willed it into </v>

2326
01:42:13.481 --> 01:42:15.550
<v Speaker 2>being and look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here I am,</v>

2327
01:42:15.700 --> 01:42:16.860
<v Speaker 2>you can do it too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2328
01:42:17.170 --> 01:42:21.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorta how many people also willed it</v>
<v Speaker 2>into being.</v>

2329
01:42:21.380 --> 01:42:24.010
<v Speaker 2>It didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like let's get the full numbers.</v>

2330
01:42:24.170 --> 01:42:28.000
<v Speaker 2>How many people daydreaming all day and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they never got that pony.</v>

2331
01:42:28.360 --> 01:42:31.210
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I call this the biography bias.</v>

2332
01:42:31.630 --> 01:42:33.730
<v Speaker 2>People write biographies of Steve Jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

2333
01:42:33.731 --> 01:42:34.564
<v Speaker 2>so here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You enroll in a really elite college </v>

2334
01:42:36.341 --> 01:42:38.140
<v Speaker 2>dropout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Move back to your parents' house.</v>

2335
01:42:38.141 --> 01:42:40.060
<v Speaker 2>It started a startup company in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>garage.</v>

2336
01:42:40.150 --> 01:42:45.150
<v Speaker 2>It works actually how many people did </v>
<v Speaker 2>this in the seventies and they did start</v>

2337
01:42:45.621 --> 01:42:48.010
<v Speaker 2>up companies and they went out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>business in three months or whatever.</v>

2338
01:42:48.011 --> 01:42:51.040
<v Speaker 2>You have to have a good product now and </v>
<v Speaker 2>no one writes a biography of them,</v>

2339
01:42:51.100 --> 01:42:53.680
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we only hear the hits,</v>

2340
01:42:53.710 --> 01:42:55.960
<v Speaker 2>forget the Mrs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at least those people,</v>

2341
01:42:56.110 --> 01:42:58.900
<v Speaker 2>even if they failed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they took a shot at something.</v>

2342
01:42:58.901 --> 01:43:01.060
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to make something happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It fails.</v>

2343
01:43:01.061 --> 01:43:02.830
<v Speaker 2>They could try something else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And maybe the third,</v>

2344
01:43:02.831 --> 01:43:04.300
<v Speaker 2>fourth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fifth one will take,</v>

2345
01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:05.553
<v Speaker 2>but the idea of the secret is the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>preposterous thing ever was because </v>

2346
01:43:07.511 --> 01:43:11.620
<v Speaker 2>you're sitting around imagining that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to will it into existence,</v>

2347
01:43:11.800 --> 01:43:14.290
<v Speaker 2>the perfect spouse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the perfect home,</v>

2348
01:43:14.291 --> 01:43:15.124
<v Speaker 2>the perfect family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you would just sit and dream about </v>

2349
01:43:17.441 --> 01:43:19.900
<v Speaker 2>it and write it down and put pictures of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it up on the wall.</v>

2350
01:43:20.070 --> 01:43:22.130
<v Speaker 2>And then you would make it happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2351
01:43:22.180 --> 01:43:23.440
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to go do things,</v>

2352
01:43:23.441 --> 01:43:25.750
<v Speaker 2>you gotta to do it and to do things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's this.</v>

2353
01:43:25.810 --> 01:43:26.643
<v Speaker 2>The one thing that keeps people from </v>
<v Speaker 2>achieving things is the actually going </v>

2354
01:43:30.491 --> 01:43:32.950
<v Speaker 2>out and doing things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For whatever reason,</v>

2355
01:43:32.951 --> 01:43:35.950
<v Speaker 2>we have this blockade against action,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2356
01:43:35.980 --> 01:43:39.790
<v Speaker 2>People are terrified of the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like we're terrified of death,</v>

2357
01:43:39.850 --> 01:43:42.040
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Terrified of the unknown.</v>

2358
01:43:42.370 --> 01:43:45.430
<v Speaker 2>You have the role of chance is huge and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't,</v>

2359
01:43:45.431 --> 01:43:46.264
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

2360
01:43:46.270 --> 01:43:50.080
<v Speaker 2>we forget to see the failures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a ride the other day with a guy,</v>

2361
01:43:50.081 --> 01:43:50.711
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you do?</v>

2362
01:43:50.711 --> 01:43:52.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a venture</v>

2363
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:53.900
<v Speaker 1>capitalist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's the ratio?</v>

2364
01:43:53.901 --> 01:43:54.621
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have the,</v>

2365
01:43:54.621 --> 01:43:56.730
<v Speaker 1>you put in 200,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>$500,000,</v>

2366
01:43:57.140 --> 01:43:58.320
<v Speaker 1>half pay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

2367
01:43:58.321 --> 01:43:59.000
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2368
01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:02.140
<v Speaker 1>90 percent fail because I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

2369
01:44:02.141 --> 01:44:02.974
<v Speaker 1>you nine out of 10 companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you invest half a million or whatever </v>

2370
01:44:04.881 --> 01:44:05.421
<v Speaker 1>it's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

2371
01:44:05.421 --> 01:44:06.350
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the one,</v>

2372
01:44:06.820 --> 01:44:09.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one I made $20 million dollars on,</v>

2373
01:44:09.051 --> 01:44:09.884
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than makes up for the nine </v>

2374
01:44:10.581 --> 01:44:11.270
<v Speaker 1>failures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2375
01:44:11.270 --> 01:44:13.100
<v Speaker 1>Oh wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2376
01:44:13.220 --> 01:44:15.470
<v Speaker 1>that's a high ratio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's,</v>

2377
01:44:15.500 --> 01:44:18.140
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know there's research on entrepreneurs</v>

2378
01:44:18.141 --> 01:44:18.974
<v Speaker 1>and how risk taking you should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So entrepreneurs score high and risk </v>

2379
01:44:21.531 --> 01:44:22.071
<v Speaker 1>taking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2380
01:44:22.071 --> 01:44:22.660
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

2381
01:44:22.660 --> 01:44:24.050
<v Speaker 1>they're not risk averse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2382
01:44:24.051 --> 01:44:26.000
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But on the other hand,</v>

2383
01:44:26.001 --> 01:44:28.880
<v Speaker 1>some of them have what's called the over</v>
<v Speaker 1>optimism bias.</v>

2384
01:44:28.910 --> 01:44:30.230
<v Speaker 1>They just never give up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

2385
01:44:30.350 --> 01:44:32.180
<v Speaker 1>this is the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sticking with it.</v>

2386
01:44:32.181 --> 01:44:33.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to keep pouring money into it.</v>

2387
01:44:33.650 --> 01:44:34.483
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

2388
01:44:34.670 --> 01:44:37.270
<v Speaker 1>nine out of 10 fail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just keep trying until you get the one.</v>

2389
01:44:37.271 --> 01:44:39.200
<v Speaker 1>You at some point you got to be a risk </v>
<v Speaker 1>taker,</v>

2390
01:44:39.201 --> 01:44:41.330
<v Speaker 1>but not too crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta know when to bail.</v>

2391
01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:42.470
<v Speaker 1>You got to know when to bail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2392
01:44:42.670 --> 01:44:43.503
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a crazy way to make a </v>

2393
01:44:44.811 --> 01:44:46.400
<v Speaker 1>living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2394
01:44:46.430 --> 01:44:46.711
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2395
01:44:46.711 --> 01:44:47.720
<v Speaker 1>on other people to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2396
01:44:47.721 --> 01:44:49.460
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever watch shark tank?</v>

2397
01:44:49.580 --> 01:44:51.890
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes my wife and I've been binge </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching shark tank.</v>

2398
01:44:52.190 --> 01:44:53.770
<v Speaker 1>The stuff that people come up with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2399
01:44:53.780 --> 01:44:55.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like some of them are just </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous,</v>

2400
01:44:55.821 --> 01:44:59.180
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's kind of like American </v>
<v Speaker 1>idol where they get let those ridiculous</v>

2401
01:44:59.181 --> 01:45:00.014
<v Speaker 1>people on because it's entertaining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's half the fun is watching people's </v>

2402
01:45:02.901 --> 01:45:03.734
<v Speaker 1>preposterous ideas through that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other night he had a little of this </v>

2403
01:45:06.861 --> 01:45:08.930
<v Speaker 1>little chip thing he put over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>computer,</v>

2404
01:45:09.240 --> 01:45:11.510
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the camera so that,</v>

2405
01:45:11.511 --> 01:45:14.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the NSA or whoever can't watch you watch</v>

2406
01:45:15.010 --> 01:45:15.340
<v Speaker 1>in it.</v>

2407
01:45:15.340 --> 01:45:16.370
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2408
01:45:16.371 --> 01:45:17.230
<v Speaker 1>so here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2409
01:45:17.240 --> 01:45:20.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to sell it for nine 95 and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>we get one percent of the market,</v>

2410
01:45:20.211 --> 01:45:20.481
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

2411
01:45:20.481 --> 01:45:20.870
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2412
01:45:20.870 --> 01:45:23.960
<v Speaker 1>we're all going to be billionaires.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then one of the sharks said,</v>

2413
01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:25.790
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just put a piece of tape over there.</v>

2414
01:45:25.791 --> 01:45:26.624
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I saw mark Zuckerberg put a </v>

2415
01:45:27.831 --> 01:45:30.740
<v Speaker 1>piece of duck tape on his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the camera.</v>

2416
01:45:31.380 --> 01:45:35.210
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2417
01:45:35.230 --> 01:45:38.120
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or somebody else said it'd be fun if you</v>

2418
01:45:38.121 --> 01:45:41.390
<v Speaker 1>had a little thing he put over it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was an image on the inside,</v>

2419
01:45:41.391 --> 01:45:42.820
<v Speaker 1>it was like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know something.</v>

2420
01:45:42.830 --> 01:45:43.670
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that the type</v>

2421
01:45:43.680 --> 01:45:44.513
<v Speaker 2>cyber person that would have to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting around all day waiting for you </v>

2422
01:45:46.461 --> 01:45:48.830
<v Speaker 2>to turn your laptop camera on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on,</v>

2423
01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:49.753
<v Speaker 2>let me see what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they must have algorithms that just </v>

2424
01:45:52.881 --> 01:45:55.110
<v Speaker 2>look and scan and try to find it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2425
01:45:55.640 --> 01:45:59.090
<v Speaker 2>I could only imagine what's up and stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>that came out over the weekend.</v>

2426
01:45:59.130 --> 01:45:59.963
<v Speaker 2>I will tell you about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Snowden was really leading the sound of </v>

2427
01:46:01.731 --> 01:46:02.450
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2428
01:46:02.450 --> 01:46:05.210
<v Speaker 2>the Nsa knows who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just by the sound of your voice.</v>

2429
01:46:05.211 --> 01:46:09.740
<v Speaker 2>And their tech predates apple and Amazon</v>
<v Speaker 2>or report on the intercept,</v>

2430
01:46:09.741 --> 01:46:13.160
<v Speaker 2>citing documents leaked by former NSA </v>
<v Speaker 2>contractor,</v>

2431
01:46:13.161 --> 01:46:13.994
<v Speaker 2>Edward Snowden revealed that the NSA has</v>
<v Speaker 2>highly refined [inaudible] voice </v>

2432
01:46:17.961 --> 01:46:18.794
<v Speaker 2>recognition software.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The agency's technology dates back more </v>

2433
01:46:21.590 --> 01:46:25.850
<v Speaker 2>than a decade and was instrumental in </v>
<v Speaker 2>helping to identify Saddam Hussein after</v>

2434
01:46:25.851 --> 01:46:27.800
<v Speaker 2>the invasion of Iraq.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reports dated,</v>

2435
01:46:28.580 --> 01:46:29.413
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your voice were just in the room with </v>

2436
01:46:30.921 --> 01:46:32.610
<v Speaker 2>your laptop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you mean on the phone?</v>

2437
01:46:32.611 --> 01:46:33.444
<v Speaker 2>Supposedly it can now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can use almost any microphone </v>

2438
01:46:35.451 --> 01:46:39.890
<v Speaker 2>that's connected to the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every letter in your voice,</v>

2439
01:46:39.891 --> 01:46:40.724
<v Speaker 2>they're the recognition they have is </v>
<v Speaker 2>better than a face print or a </v>

2440
01:46:43.041 --> 01:46:43.874
<v Speaker 2>fingerprint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if they wanted to find young Jamie </v>

2441
01:46:46.070 --> 01:46:48.110
<v Speaker 2>that could get you or laptop already </v>
<v Speaker 2>have it.</v>

2442
01:46:48.470 --> 01:46:49.303
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is saying or you have had it and </v>

2443
01:46:52.350 --> 01:46:53.880
<v Speaker 2>don't worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's almost nothing you can.</v>

2444
01:46:53.940 --> 01:46:58.940
<v Speaker 2>What is your thoughts on snowden and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then who's the other guy?</v>

2445
01:47:02.110 --> 01:47:04.900
<v Speaker 2>I have A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a bad feeling about Julia.</v>

2446
01:47:05.130 --> 01:47:08.940
<v Speaker 2>Jay have a good feeling about snowden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have everybody had a good feeling</v>

2447
01:47:08.941 --> 01:47:10.140
<v Speaker 2>about a sausage?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2448
01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:12.160
<v Speaker 2>Trump got into office.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2449
01:47:12.161 --> 01:47:13.920
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The stuff before that,</v>

2450
01:47:13.921 --> 01:47:14.754
<v Speaker 2>I didn't care for him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I saw a snowden made an appearance </v>

2451
01:47:17.750 --> 01:47:20.100
<v Speaker 2>at Ted was the last 10 I went to in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Vancouver.</v>

2452
01:47:20.260 --> 01:47:24.960
<v Speaker 2>Then they rolled them out on a computer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big screen and there he was in Russia or</v>

2453
01:47:24.961 --> 01:47:25.794
<v Speaker 2>somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2454
01:47:25.990 --> 01:47:30.990
<v Speaker 2>But the points he made were similar to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that of Daniel Ellsberg and the Pentagon</v>

2455
01:47:31.681 --> 01:47:32.514
<v Speaker 2>papers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like we should know what our </v>

2456
01:47:33.541 --> 01:47:35.820
<v Speaker 2>government is doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't have to know everything.</v>

2457
01:47:35.821 --> 01:47:38.040
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to share the nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 2>codes with uni,</v>

2458
01:47:38.670 --> 01:47:39.820
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at some point,</v>

2459
01:47:39.830 --> 01:47:42.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some line there how much freedom</v>

2460
01:47:42.241 --> 01:47:44.190
<v Speaker 2>versus security and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

2461
01:47:44.191 --> 01:47:45.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's too much stuff going on.</v>

2462
01:47:45.750 --> 01:47:49.440
<v Speaker 2>Even in the Obama administration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that administration of transparency,</v>

2463
01:47:49.740 --> 01:47:51.510
<v Speaker 2>this is when a lot of this stuff was </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening and say,</v>

2464
01:47:51.511 --> 01:47:52.344
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was Bush that was doing </v>

2465
01:47:53.611 --> 01:47:56.070
<v Speaker 2>this kind of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when we have to remember that Edward</v>

2466
01:47:56.070 --> 01:47:58.170
<v Speaker 2>Snowden went into hiding during the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Obama administration,</v>

2467
01:47:58.440 --> 01:48:00.630
<v Speaker 2>one of the worst administrations ever on</v>
<v Speaker 2>record for,</v>

2468
01:48:00.631 --> 01:48:02.030
<v Speaker 2>with whistleblowers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2469
01:48:02.250 --> 01:48:05.460
<v Speaker 2>Which is really crazy because if you go </v>
<v Speaker 2>look at the hope and change website when</v>

2470
01:48:05.461 --> 01:48:06.294
<v Speaker 2>it initially existed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the big promises was protection </v>

2471
01:48:10.621 --> 01:48:15.621
<v Speaker 2>for whistleblowers exposing illegal </v>
<v Speaker 2>activity and that's just not true yet.</v>

2472
01:48:16.200 --> 01:48:17.700
<v Speaker 2>I think he should be allowed to come </v>
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>

2473
01:48:17.880 --> 01:48:19.650
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't have to be.</v>

2474
01:48:19.660 --> 01:48:21.220
<v Speaker 2>Worship is a hero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like this.</v>

2475
01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:25.500
<v Speaker 2>He said brave person before him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We didn't know we were talking about any</v>

2476
01:48:25.501 --> 01:48:27.000
<v Speaker 2>of this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know about this stuff.</v>

2477
01:48:27.240 --> 01:48:28.073
<v Speaker 2>While there was some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was an NSA contractor from many </v>

2478
01:48:32.490 --> 01:48:35.460
<v Speaker 2>years ago who brought this stuff up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he was sort of dismissed.</v>

2479
01:48:36.090 --> 01:48:36.923
<v Speaker 2>What is his name?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was the original NSA contractor that </v>

2480
01:48:39.661 --> 01:48:42.570
<v Speaker 2>brought this up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to say in 2011.</v>

2481
01:48:43.500 --> 01:48:45.900
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably could see him in my mind.</v>

2482
01:48:45.901 --> 01:48:48.030
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember his name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

2483
01:48:48.090 --> 01:48:48.923
<v Speaker 2>Bill Binney.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure who that pull that pull </v>

2484
01:48:50.261 --> 01:48:53.610
<v Speaker 2>that guy out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Young Jamie I just read was the original</v>

2485
01:48:53.611 --> 01:48:54.421
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bill Benny,</v>

2486
01:48:54.421 --> 01:48:55.254
<v Speaker 2>the original NSA whistleblower on </v>
<v Speaker 2>snowden nine slash 11 and illegal </v>

2487
01:48:57.840 --> 01:48:58.950
<v Speaker 2>surveillance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was,</v>

2488
01:48:59.130 --> 01:49:04.130
<v Speaker 2>he became incredibly concerned post nine</v>
<v Speaker 2>slash 11 when they started,</v>

2489
01:49:05.481 --> 01:49:06.314
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing a lot of this in the initial work </v>

2490
01:49:08.881 --> 01:49:11.730
<v Speaker 2>on computer surveillance and all this </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff they were doing.</v>

2491
01:49:11.731 --> 01:49:12.564
<v Speaker 2>And he bailed and interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you started talking about it openly </v>

2492
01:49:15.271 --> 01:49:18.780
<v Speaker 2>and publicly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then snowden came out after that.</v>

2493
01:49:18.830 --> 01:49:19.663
<v Speaker 2>And the snowden thing was where people </v>
<v Speaker 2>got all [inaudible] look what we're </v>

2494
01:49:23.290 --> 01:49:25.230
<v Speaker 2>really got a chance to understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2495
01:49:25.231 --> 01:49:27.780
<v Speaker 2>this is actually happening right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a real thing,</v>

2496
01:49:27.840 --> 01:49:28.673
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2497
01:49:28.710 --> 01:49:31.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do think the government does overreach</v>

2498
01:49:31.291 --> 01:49:33.970
<v Speaker 2>with their security theater.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2499
01:49:33.971 --> 01:49:37.800
<v Speaker 2>we're at orange level today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember that believable.</v>

2500
01:49:37.801 --> 01:49:39.630
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't happen anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened to that?</v>

2501
01:49:39.631 --> 01:49:43.080
<v Speaker 2>And yet the number of Americans that die</v>
<v Speaker 2>from foreign terrorism.</v>

2502
01:49:43.140 --> 01:49:44.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are some of the domestic terrorist</v>

2503
01:49:44.611 --> 01:49:48.160
<v Speaker 2>if you want to consider mass public </v>
<v Speaker 2>shootings in that category,</v>

2504
01:49:48.161 --> 01:49:50.800
<v Speaker 2>but foreign terrorists coming here to </v>
<v Speaker 2>kill Americans.</v>

2505
01:49:51.200 --> 01:49:52.270
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2506
01:49:52.271 --> 01:49:52.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

2507
01:49:52.820 --> 01:49:53.221
<v Speaker 2>what is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

2508
01:49:53.221 --> 01:49:54.054
<v Speaker 2>is less than bathtub.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Drownings are weightless and they like </v>

2509
01:49:56.110 --> 01:49:58.150
<v Speaker 2>lightning struck double lightening </v>
<v Speaker 2>strikes or something.</v>

2510
01:49:58.151 --> 01:49:58.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just nothing.</v>

2511
01:49:58.930 --> 01:50:00.250
<v Speaker 2>It's like shark attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2512
01:50:00.330 --> 01:50:01.163
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just why are we spending billions </v>

2513
01:50:03.820 --> 01:50:05.540
<v Speaker 2>and billions of dollars on this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because they put.</v>

2514
01:50:05.570 --> 01:50:06.910
<v Speaker 2>That was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They could,</v>

2515
01:50:07.010 --> 01:50:07.350
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2516
01:50:07.350 --> 01:50:08.183
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like the proverbial elephant </v>

2517
01:50:09.491 --> 01:50:11.700
<v Speaker 2>repellent you'd ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Since we put the repellent here,</v>

2518
01:50:11.780 --> 01:50:13.710
<v Speaker 2>not a single elephant is going to end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2519
01:50:14.010 --> 01:50:14.741
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2520
01:50:14.741 --> 01:50:16.150
<v Speaker 2>Michael Sherman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're Americans.</v>

2521
01:50:16.151 --> 01:50:17.860
<v Speaker 2>We don't want to get caught with our </v>
<v Speaker 2>pants down.</v>

2522
01:50:18.370 --> 01:50:20.020
<v Speaker 2>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

2523
01:50:20.030 --> 01:50:23.200
<v Speaker 2>it's there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just read Daniel Ellsberg's new book,</v>

2524
01:50:23.201 --> 01:50:26.160
<v Speaker 2>the Doomsday Machine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is on nuclear deterrence.</v>

2525
01:50:26.161 --> 01:50:28.700
<v Speaker 2>He's against nuclear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He thinks nuclear deterrence as a,</v>

2526
01:50:28.830 --> 01:50:29.663
<v Speaker 2>as a rational strategy is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a longterm mistake because of the </v>

2527
01:50:32.381 --> 01:50:35.020
<v Speaker 2>possibilities of error,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

2528
01:50:35.021 --> 01:50:35.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all good points,</v>

2529
01:50:35.921 --> 01:50:36.754
<v Speaker 2>but he has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure why it took so long to </v>

2530
01:50:38.410 --> 01:50:39.243
<v Speaker 2>bring this book out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got his notes when he worked for </v>

2531
01:50:40.601 --> 01:50:41.434
<v Speaker 2>the State Department in the fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the rand corporation in the </v>

2532
01:50:44.020 --> 01:50:44.853
<v Speaker 2>early sixties during the Kennedy </v>
<v Speaker 2>Administration of the kinds of </v>

2533
01:50:46.601 --> 01:50:47.434
<v Speaker 2>calculations that go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our own government was making about how </v>

2534
01:50:49.421 --> 01:50:52.510
<v Speaker 2>many people we were willing to kill in </v>
<v Speaker 2>defense,</v>

2535
01:50:52.511 --> 01:50:54.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of millions of Russians just,</v>

2536
01:50:54.611 --> 01:50:55.061
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was like,</v>

2537
01:50:55.061 --> 01:50:57.070
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like the scene from um,</v>

2538
01:50:57.180 --> 01:50:59.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dr strangelove where George C dot Scott,</v>

2539
01:50:59.770 --> 01:51:00.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

2540
01:51:00.520 --> 01:51:02.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying we wouldn't get our hair </v>
<v Speaker 2>mussed,</v>

2541
01:51:02.321 --> 01:51:04.270
<v Speaker 2>but 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30 million tops.</v>

2542
01:51:05.610 --> 01:51:06.443
<v Speaker 2>And that's actually real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the kind of numbers they were </v>

2543
01:51:08.141 --> 01:51:09.350
<v Speaker 2>throwing out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2544
01:51:09.370 --> 01:51:13.210
<v Speaker 2>You can't leave a human being without </v>
<v Speaker 2>much responsibility and power.</v>

2545
01:51:13.570 --> 01:51:17.720
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's the bottom line when </v>
<v Speaker 2>it comes to this NSA surveillance things</v>

2546
01:51:17.740 --> 01:51:18.573
<v Speaker 2>that all these government agencies are </v>
<v Speaker 2>populated by human beings and human </v>

2547
01:51:22.481 --> 01:51:23.314
<v Speaker 2>beings should not have that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>power over other human beings that are </v>

2548
01:51:25.571 --> 01:51:27.040
<v Speaker 2>just citizens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2549
01:51:27.070 --> 01:51:27.903
<v Speaker 2>Because they're just the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ability to check all the snowden </v>

2550
01:51:31.210 --> 01:51:32.043
<v Speaker 2>talked about people being able to check </v>
<v Speaker 2>in on their exes and read their emails </v>

2551
01:51:34.991 --> 01:51:37.960
<v Speaker 2>and they were doing things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is when Obama was like,</v>

2552
01:51:37.961 --> 01:51:38.470
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2553
01:51:38.470 --> 01:51:41.470
<v Speaker 2>this is just better data.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't just metadata,</v>

2554
01:51:41.471 --> 01:51:42.360
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoever.</v>

2555
01:51:42.490 --> 01:51:46.080
<v Speaker 2>They were looking at everything and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2556
01:51:46.580 --> 01:51:50.410
<v Speaker 2>that's something we should know about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we didn't until snowden and now this</v>

2557
01:51:50.411 --> 01:51:51.820
<v Speaker 2>poor guy has to live in Russia.</v>

2558
01:51:51.880 --> 01:51:52.600
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nope,</v>

2559
01:51:52.600 --> 01:51:54.580
<v Speaker 2>I think he should be brought back for </v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

2560
01:51:55.060 --> 01:51:55.893
<v Speaker 2>But could he be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would have to do something awesome </v>

2561
01:51:57.041 --> 01:51:59.920
<v Speaker 2>for trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Might be after trump.</v>

2562
01:51:59.921 --> 01:52:00.754
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno.</v>

2563
01:52:00.820 --> 01:52:04.240
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he jumps out that of all people.</v>

2564
01:52:04.241 --> 01:52:05.740
<v Speaker 2>It's Putin who's protecting it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2565
01:52:06.100 --> 01:52:06.970
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

2566
01:52:07.030 --> 01:52:09.280
<v Speaker 2>I know it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2567
01:52:09.281 --> 01:52:10.280
<v Speaker 2>he's probably helping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

2568
01:52:10.480 --> 01:52:13.110
<v Speaker 2>But when he makes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you watched the Ted Ted talk,</v>

2569
01:52:13.340 --> 01:52:14.173
<v Speaker 2>Ted to interview,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chris Anderson was just talking to them </v>

2570
01:52:15.941 --> 01:52:18.700
<v Speaker 2>on the stage when from undisclosed </v>
<v Speaker 2>location in Russia,</v>

2571
01:52:18.701 --> 01:52:22.420
<v Speaker 2>you can't come up totally reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what democracy.</v>

2572
01:52:22.510 --> 01:52:24.190
<v Speaker 2>Here's a democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what we live in.</v>

2573
01:52:24.710 --> 01:52:28.990
<v Speaker 2>Citizens need to know some things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not everything came up totally rational.</v>

2574
01:52:29.380 --> 01:52:30.213
<v Speaker 2>He did a great podcast with Neil </v>
<v Speaker 2>degrasse Tyson and he came off very </v>

2575
01:52:32.951 --> 01:52:34.120
<v Speaker 2>rational there as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2576
01:52:34.121 --> 01:52:35.230
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know neal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2577
01:52:35.530 --> 01:52:37.780
<v Speaker 2>interview.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2578
01:52:38.440 --> 01:52:40.090
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

2579
01:52:40.540 --> 01:52:42.640
<v Speaker 2>we don't agree to that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>surveillance.</v>

2580
01:52:42.640 --> 01:52:44.620
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's very orwellian.</v>

2581
01:52:44.650 --> 01:52:46.370
<v Speaker 2>It's not what we want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2582
01:52:46.670 --> 01:52:48.740
<v Speaker 2>This is not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not stopping terrorism.</v>

2583
01:52:48.760 --> 01:52:50.300
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just spying on people.</v>

2584
01:52:50.870 --> 01:52:51.703
<v Speaker 2>And also people are rightly concerned </v>
<v Speaker 2>that anything that they find could be </v>

2585
01:52:55.311 --> 01:52:56.144
<v Speaker 2>used against you if you are a political </v>
<v Speaker 2>opponent of theirs or if there's </v>

2586
01:52:59.511 --> 01:53:02.870
<v Speaker 2>something that you're trying to oppose </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they go,</v>

2587
01:53:02.871 --> 01:53:03.411
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2588
01:53:03.411 --> 01:53:04.244
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we found out the year in the cuckold </v>

2589
01:53:05.870 --> 01:53:08.130
<v Speaker 2>porn buddy or whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2590
01:53:08.490 --> 01:53:10.310
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's too much tennis stuff.</v>

2591
01:53:10.311 --> 01:53:11.510
<v Speaker 2>Nixon did with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2592
01:53:11.870 --> 01:53:13.970
<v Speaker 2>with the hoover Jesuit horror and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>FBI.</v>

2593
01:53:13.990 --> 01:53:15.640
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think whoever did it on his own right,</v>

2594
01:53:15.710 --> 01:53:16.600
<v Speaker 2>he did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it predicts.</v>

2595
01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.880
<v Speaker 2>It was a fascinating character,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2596
01:53:20.040 --> 01:53:20.873
<v Speaker 2>crossdresser as mind freak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like spying on everybody just to </v>

2597
01:53:25.521 --> 01:53:28.220
<v Speaker 2>try to hide his own secrets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really amazing.</v>

2598
01:53:28.730 --> 01:53:31.520
<v Speaker 2>But there's an example of one person </v>
<v Speaker 2>flawed human,</v>

2599
01:53:31.521 --> 01:53:32.354
<v Speaker 2>like everyone else given all this power </v>
<v Speaker 2>and imagine what hoover would do today </v>

2600
01:53:36.891 --> 01:53:37.520
<v Speaker 2>with the Internet.</v>

2601
01:53:37.520 --> 01:53:38.270
<v Speaker 2>I mean he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

2602
01:53:38.270 --> 01:53:39.380
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>

2603
01:53:39.950 --> 01:53:42.620
<v Speaker 2>Arguably more flawed than normal human </v>
<v Speaker 2>beings.</v>

2604
01:53:42.800 --> 01:53:43.633
<v Speaker 2>And I think that goes back to the thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you were talking about with these </v>

2605
01:53:46.041 --> 01:53:46.874
<v Speaker 2>cult leaders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like humans should not have power </v>

2606
01:53:50.450 --> 01:53:52.040
<v Speaker 2>over other humans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2607
01:53:52.100 --> 01:53:52.933
<v Speaker 2>When they do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do terrible things and they abuse </v>

2608
01:53:56.871 --> 01:54:01.871
<v Speaker 2>that power and they mean it's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility that one would have to be</v>

2609
01:54:03.081 --> 01:54:05.360
<v Speaker 2>able to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>George C dot Scott thing and say,</v>

2610
01:54:05.390 --> 01:54:06.230
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 million,</v>

2611
01:54:06.231 --> 01:54:07.460
<v Speaker 2>30 million,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no big deal.</v>

2612
01:54:07.640 --> 01:54:09.670
<v Speaker 2>It a few people in Chicago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2613
01:54:09.740 --> 01:54:10.573
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is,</v>

2614
01:54:11.210 --> 01:54:14.360
<v Speaker 2>that's a crazy thing for a human being </v>
<v Speaker 2>to have at their fingertips.</v>

2615
01:54:14.361 --> 01:54:15.290
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

2616
01:54:15.291 --> 01:54:18.290
<v Speaker 2>And the other problem is bureaucracy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any large organization,</v>

2617
01:54:18.291 --> 01:54:21.380
<v Speaker 2>but especially bureaucracies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their tendency is to keep alive.</v>

2618
01:54:21.381 --> 01:54:24.540
<v Speaker 2>We gotta keep our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep our jobs and uh,</v>

2619
01:54:24.550 --> 01:54:25.383
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the moment you set up a government </v>

2620
01:54:27.261 --> 01:54:29.900
<v Speaker 2>agencies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really difficult to shut it off.</v>

2621
01:54:30.500 --> 01:54:31.333
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost impossible because you have real </v>

2622
01:54:33.681 --> 01:54:36.560
<v Speaker 2>people with jobs and mortgages and </v>
<v Speaker 2>families that I get to keep my job,</v>

2623
01:54:37.010 --> 01:54:39.920
<v Speaker 2>so we have to justify why we need our </v>
<v Speaker 2>department and so on.</v>

2624
01:54:39.921 --> 01:54:40.754
<v Speaker 2>And it just always builds that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that is the big issue with big </v>

2625
01:54:43.131 --> 01:54:45.230
<v Speaker 2>government is it just grows bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does,</v>

2626
01:54:45.290 --> 01:54:46.660
<v Speaker 2>it never shrinks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They never say,</v>

2627
01:54:46.690 --> 01:54:47.450
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

2628
01:54:47.450 --> 01:54:49.440
<v Speaker 2>We don't need the irs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2629
01:54:49.580 --> 01:54:51.300
<v Speaker 2>This is nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just,</v>

2630
01:54:51.710 --> 01:54:52.543
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we realized that if we don't have the </v>

2631
01:54:53.361 --> 01:54:54.194
<v Speaker 2>irs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to pay so many less people that </v>

2632
01:54:55.391 --> 01:54:57.400
<v Speaker 2>we can actually get less money in taxes </v>
<v Speaker 2>from folks.</v>

2633
01:54:57.650 --> 01:54:58.800
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

2634
01:54:59.040 --> 01:55:00.590
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2635
01:55:00.890 --> 01:55:01.980
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's A.</v>

2636
01:55:02.230 --> 01:55:03.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a huge problem.</v>

2637
01:55:03.510 --> 01:55:05.120
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a good solution to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2638
01:55:05.330 --> 01:55:09.200
<v Speaker 2>it brings me back to the last word of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the title of your book.</v>

2639
01:55:09.320 --> 01:55:11.750
<v Speaker 2>The scientific search for the afterlife.</v>

2640
01:55:11.780 --> 01:55:15.200
<v Speaker 2>Immortality and Utopia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Utopia.</v>

2641
01:55:15.201 --> 01:55:16.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hope is what we're always looking for.</v>

2642
01:55:16.990 --> 01:55:17.541
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>totally.</v>

2643
01:55:17.541 --> 01:55:19.550
<v Speaker 2>And it doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can't ever exist.</v>

2644
01:55:19.551 --> 01:55:24.170
<v Speaker 2>Not even in principle because there is </v>
<v Speaker 2>no right society because we have so much</v>

2645
01:55:24.171 --> 01:55:25.004
<v Speaker 2>variation in our interests and needs and</v>
<v Speaker 2>wants and your abilities and you know </v>

2646
01:55:28.270 --> 01:55:31.040
<v Speaker 2>the idea of programming by fed from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>top down,</v>

2647
01:55:31.041 --> 01:55:31.874
<v Speaker 2>this is what we're going to do and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to work or else you're out and </v>

2648
01:55:35.680 --> 01:55:36.513
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem with utilitarianism is get </v>

2649
01:55:37.880 --> 01:55:38.713
<v Speaker 2>you that utilitarian calculus of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>greatest good for the greatest number </v>

2650
01:55:41.420 --> 01:55:43.980
<v Speaker 2>and we know what that is and are </v>
<v Speaker 2>standing</v>

2651
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:46.650
<v Speaker 1>in our way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are preventing utopia,</v>

2652
01:55:46.651 --> 01:55:47.484
<v Speaker 1>so we are going to eliminate you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know this is the famous trolley </v>

2653
01:55:49.531 --> 01:55:50.730
<v Speaker 1>experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a thought experiment.</v>

2654
01:55:50.731 --> 01:55:53.490
<v Speaker 1>You know the trolleys hurdling down the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tracks about to kill the five workers.</v>

2655
01:55:53.790 --> 01:55:56.220
<v Speaker 1>You're at the switch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you throw the switch,</v>

2656
01:55:56.221 --> 01:55:58.530
<v Speaker 1>it'll go down a sidetrack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll kill one worker.</v>

2657
01:55:58.660 --> 01:56:01.950
<v Speaker 1>Would you throw the switch?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Skilled the one to save the five,</v>

2658
01:56:02.790 --> 01:56:03.623
<v Speaker 1>the five?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to die if you don't do </v>

2659
01:56:04.081 --> 01:56:07.480
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we did throw the switch some.</v>

2660
01:56:07.820 --> 01:56:08.653
<v Speaker 1>Most people say they would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can go on the website and do </v>

2661
01:56:10.591 --> 01:56:13.230
<v Speaker 1>this yourself and son who's on track.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2662
01:56:13.860 --> 01:56:18.860
<v Speaker 1>it really does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's rush limbaugh on this one track she</v>

2663
01:56:19.420 --> 01:56:22.620
<v Speaker 1>imagined and five school kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2664
01:56:23.030 --> 01:56:25.600
<v Speaker 1>with massive potential for the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

2665
01:56:25.630 --> 01:56:28.650
<v Speaker 1>so now most people said they would flip </v>
<v Speaker 1>the switch,</v>

2666
01:56:28.651 --> 01:56:31.110
<v Speaker 1>but in an interesting twist on that.</v>

2667
01:56:31.110 --> 01:56:31.860
<v Speaker 1>So if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

2668
01:56:31.860 --> 01:56:36.860
<v Speaker 1>if you're standing on a bridge over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>track and the train is hurdling down the</v>

2669
01:56:37.291 --> 01:56:38.124
<v Speaker 1>tracks about to kill the five workers </v>
<v Speaker 1>and standing next to you is a great big </v>

2670
01:56:40.201 --> 01:56:42.330
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you hip check him off?</v>

2671
01:56:42.331 --> 01:56:44.180
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He lands on the tracks.</v>

2672
01:56:44.181 --> 01:56:46.020
<v Speaker 1>SPLAT.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's killed by the train,</v>

2673
01:56:46.021 --> 01:56:48.240
<v Speaker 1>but it stops it and saves the five </v>
<v Speaker 1>workers.</v>

2674
01:56:48.300 --> 01:56:51.420
<v Speaker 1>Now most people say I got to physically </v>
<v Speaker 1>grab them and throw them up.</v>

2675
01:56:51.421 --> 01:56:51.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2676
01:56:51.960 --> 01:56:53.190
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't do that.</v>

2677
01:56:53.670 --> 01:56:54.503
<v Speaker 1>So it's something to do with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It engages the emotional part of the </v>

2678
01:56:56.641 --> 01:57:00.870
<v Speaker 1>brain that actively killing somebody is </v>
<v Speaker 1>way harder than passively killing.</v>

2679
01:57:00.960 --> 01:57:03.390
<v Speaker 1>So if you only have to put,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're at a 52 bomber,</v>

2680
01:57:03.570 --> 01:57:04.403
<v Speaker 1>35,000 feet up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you only have to press the button to </v>

2681
01:57:06.151 --> 01:57:07.640
<v Speaker 1>release the bombs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not so</v>

2682
01:57:07.660 --> 01:57:08.493
<v Speaker 3>heart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's even more actively doing it </v>

2683
01:57:10.541 --> 01:57:12.040
<v Speaker 3>than a drone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The drone,</v>

2684
01:57:12.041 --> 01:57:15.730
<v Speaker 3>which apparently is a giant issue for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the drone pilots,</v>

2685
01:57:16.060 --> 01:57:20.980
<v Speaker 3>apparently they suffer from really weird</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brill Esd even though they're in Arizona</v>

2686
01:57:20.981 --> 01:57:23.200
<v Speaker 3>doing it in a rack or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2687
01:57:23.201 --> 01:57:24.450
<v Speaker 3>the nightmares.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2688
01:57:24.500 --> 01:57:26.110
<v Speaker 3>they're pretty intense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>

2689
01:57:26.111 --> 01:57:27.550
<v Speaker 3>I had not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hadn't heard that.</v>

2690
01:57:27.790 --> 01:57:28.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2691
01:57:29.920 --> 01:57:30.753
<v Speaker 3>if you're looking at a screen and you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>seeing someone on the other side of the </v>

2692
01:57:35.591 --> 01:57:37.260
<v Speaker 3>planet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2693
01:57:37.300 --> 01:57:38.870
<v Speaker 3>you're in Nevada,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2694
01:57:38.930 --> 01:57:40.640
<v Speaker 3>And some military base,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2695
01:57:40.840 --> 01:57:44.410
<v Speaker 3>And you're hitting that button and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're watching the screen.</v>

2696
01:57:44.411 --> 01:57:45.720
<v Speaker 3>You're seeing some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2697
01:57:45.980 --> 01:57:48.600
<v Speaker 3>infrared or black night vision,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2698
01:57:48.620 --> 01:57:51.100
<v Speaker 3>This'll slamming into the person that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you were just observing</v>

2699
01:57:51.370 --> 01:57:52.203
<v Speaker 1>movie about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was like the trolley problem than </v>

2700
01:57:53.901 --> 01:57:56.700
<v Speaker 1>it was maybe two years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2701
01:57:56.790 --> 01:57:58.470
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2702
01:57:58.950 --> 01:58:01.740
<v Speaker 1>the decision is to be made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2703
01:58:02.480 --> 01:58:03.313
<v Speaker 1>the setup is we know that the terrorists</v>
<v Speaker 1>and are making a bomb inside this </v>

2704
01:58:06.631 --> 01:58:09.500
<v Speaker 1>building and we can get a drone there </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

2705
01:58:09.520 --> 01:58:12.030
<v Speaker 1>to hit it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they're about to do.</v>

2706
01:58:12.031 --> 01:58:14.130
<v Speaker 1>This is toward the beginning of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're about to do this.</v>

2707
01:58:14.131 --> 01:58:17.130
<v Speaker 1>And this little girl walks into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>scene and she's selling bread.</v>

2708
01:58:17.190 --> 01:58:18.023
<v Speaker 1>I think it's in Afghanistan or Iraq.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she's on the corner so she will be </v>

2709
01:58:20.881 --> 01:58:22.470
<v Speaker 1>killed and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2710
01:58:22.480 --> 01:58:23.313
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe we could come around from the </v>

2711
01:58:24.901 --> 01:58:27.390
<v Speaker 1>other side and then she won't be in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there doing all these calculations.</v>

2712
01:58:27.391 --> 01:58:28.980
<v Speaker 1>But now there's some other people over </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

2713
01:58:29.280 --> 01:58:33.900
<v Speaker 1>So how many people innocence should we </v>
<v Speaker 1>kill because we know that the terrorists</v>

2714
01:58:33.901 --> 01:58:36.450
<v Speaker 1>are going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they complete their bomb bomb,</v>

2715
01:58:36.570 --> 01:58:39.060
<v Speaker 1>a suicide bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to go to a mall and killed</v>

2716
01:58:39.061 --> 01:58:41.040
<v Speaker 1>300 people or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they,</v>

2717
01:58:41.250 --> 01:58:41.640
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2718
01:58:41.640 --> 01:58:42.070
<v Speaker 1>how these</v>

2719
01:58:42.070 --> 01:58:44.350
<v Speaker 2>government agencies think about those </v>
<v Speaker 2>calculations,</v>

2720
01:58:44.351 --> 01:58:45.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

2721
01:58:45.020 --> 01:58:45.511
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

2722
01:58:45.511 --> 01:58:46.344
<v Speaker 2>we got to stop the bad guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how many good people are we willing </v>

2723
01:58:48.791 --> 01:58:51.100
<v Speaker 2>to kill to prevent them from killing </v>
<v Speaker 2>even more?</v>

2724
01:58:51.190 --> 01:58:54.940
<v Speaker 2>We think maybe if they do this and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>it gets murky from there.</v>

2725
01:58:55.030 --> 01:58:58.130
<v Speaker 2>Well Mike Baker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's a former,</v>

2726
01:58:58.131 --> 01:58:58.964
<v Speaker 2>a big wig at the CIA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have talked to him several times on the </v>

2727
01:59:01.151 --> 01:59:01.984
<v Speaker 2>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that he says that's </v>

2728
01:59:02.801 --> 01:59:04.390
<v Speaker 2>done by lawyers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2729
01:59:04.420 --> 01:59:05.680
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

2730
01:59:05.710 --> 01:59:06.543
<v Speaker 2>Because there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

2731
01:59:07.150 --> 01:59:07.983
<v Speaker 2>there's legal precedence about </v>
<v Speaker 2>collateral damage that came from the </v>

2732
01:59:10.871 --> 01:59:13.450
<v Speaker 2>Nuremberg laws and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2733
01:59:13.451 --> 01:59:15.040
<v Speaker 2>there's some questionable stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were doing,</v>

2734
01:59:15.041 --> 01:59:17.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's justified second world war,</v>

2735
01:59:17.621 --> 01:59:18.454
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mass bombing of Hamburg and </v>

2736
01:59:20.640 --> 01:59:25.640
<v Speaker 2>addressed in this didn't slow the Nazi </v>
<v Speaker 2>or machine at all,</v>

2737
01:59:26.590 --> 01:59:28.210
<v Speaker 2>but the idea was that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2738
01:59:28.211 --> 01:59:30.340
<v Speaker 2>the citizens will rise up and kill </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hitler.</v>

2739
01:59:30.400 --> 01:59:31.100
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2740
01:59:31.100 --> 01:59:32.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can't.</v>

2741
01:59:32.090 --> 01:59:35.170
<v Speaker 2>And in that kind of society you just </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have that kind of access or power.</v>

2742
01:59:35.890 --> 01:59:36.760
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2743
01:59:36.761 --> 01:59:39.370
<v Speaker 2>this was like when in the first Iraq </v>
<v Speaker 2>war,</v>

2744
01:59:39.371 --> 01:59:39.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll,</v>

2745
01:59:39.970 --> 01:59:42.120
<v Speaker 2>we'll stop short,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2746
01:59:42.160 --> 01:59:45.810
<v Speaker 2>Bush senior said we're going to stop </v>
<v Speaker 2>short and let Saddam's own people taking</v>

2747
01:59:45.811 --> 01:59:46.644
<v Speaker 2>them out and have their own regime </v>
<v Speaker 2>change and then we'll support the new </v>

2748
01:59:48.671 --> 01:59:50.260
<v Speaker 2>regime and it just didn't work out that </v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

2749
01:59:50.950 --> 01:59:52.420
<v Speaker 2>So they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the calculations get messy.</v>

2750
01:59:52.421 --> 01:59:53.254
<v Speaker 2>I got kind of sidetracked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem with Utopian idea is that </v>

2751
01:59:55.961 --> 01:59:57.230
<v Speaker 2>utilitarian calculus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>

2752
01:59:57.400 --> 02:00:01.030
<v Speaker 2>if most people will agree that it's okay</v>
<v Speaker 2>to kill one to save five,</v>

2753
02:00:02.080 --> 02:00:03.970
<v Speaker 2>why not kill 1 million to save $5 </v>
<v Speaker 2>million?</v>

2754
02:00:04.180 --> 02:00:05.013
<v Speaker 2>That's genocide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that is the calculator calculations </v>

2755
02:00:07.211 --> 02:00:08.044
<v Speaker 2>that genocidal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mass murderers make know that are our </v>

2756
02:00:11.140 --> 02:00:13.420
<v Speaker 2>German society would be great except for</v>
<v Speaker 2>those Jews,</v>

2757
02:00:13.421 --> 02:00:14.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the backstab,</v>

2758
02:00:14.500 --> 02:00:18.070
<v Speaker 2>the backstabbers who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who ruined us in the first world war.</v>

2759
02:00:18.430 --> 02:00:20.800
<v Speaker 2>Now we can just get rid of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be great.</v>

2760
02:00:20.980 --> 02:00:24.490
<v Speaker 2>And every genocide is based on that kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of utilitarian calculus.</v>

2761
02:00:24.520 --> 02:00:27.180
<v Speaker 2>However emotional driven it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

2762
02:00:27.210 --> 02:00:30.430
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting when you look at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>numbers from drone attacks,</v>

2763
02:00:31.260 --> 02:00:33.040
<v Speaker 2>it's some high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>80,</v>

2764
02:00:33.041 --> 02:00:36.790
<v Speaker 2>90 percent of innocent people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>killed,</v>

2765
02:00:36.920 --> 02:00:38.830
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The casualties,</v>

2766
02:00:38.960 --> 02:00:42.370
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you look at it in terms of what the</v>

2767
02:00:42.371 --> 02:00:43.204
<v Speaker 2>actual targets that we're looking for </v>
<v Speaker 2>versus the actual people that were </v>

2768
02:00:47.321 --> 02:00:48.260
<v Speaker 2>killed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2769
02:00:48.310 --> 02:00:49.143
<v Speaker 2>Collateral damage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a tremendous amount of </v>

2770
02:00:50.591 --> 02:00:51.424
<v Speaker 2>collateral damage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's not something that we would </v>

2771
02:00:52.421 --> 02:00:53.254
<v Speaker 2>ever accept from one guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say if we had one guy with a howitzer </v>

2772
02:00:56.380 --> 02:00:57.213
<v Speaker 2>and he just went in there and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blasting women and children to get to </v>

2773
02:00:59.561 --> 02:01:01.030
<v Speaker 2>the guy that's in the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>building,</v>

2774
02:01:01.340 --> 02:01:03.390
<v Speaker 2>there would be no fucking way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No going back,</v>

2775
02:01:03.400 --> 02:01:04.930
<v Speaker 2>I as a murderer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a monster.</v>

2776
02:01:05.160 --> 02:01:05.993
<v Speaker 2>But if one guy in Nevada presses a </v>
<v Speaker 2>button and some hellfire missiles come </v>

2777
02:01:09.401 --> 02:01:10.234
<v Speaker 2>shooting out of a flying robot and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>slam into that building and kill </v>

2778
02:01:13.301 --> 02:01:14.134
<v Speaker 2>everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including this one terrorist that we </v>

2779
02:01:16.041 --> 02:01:17.490
<v Speaker 2>were after,</v>
<v Speaker 2>except it.</v>

2780
02:01:17.820 --> 02:01:19.750
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in game theory,</v>

2781
02:01:19.751 --> 02:01:22.690
<v Speaker 2>there's this problem of this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>sliding scale that,</v>

2782
02:01:23.080 --> 02:01:23.913
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it's like the milgram shock </v>

2783
02:01:25.031 --> 02:01:27.500
<v Speaker 2>experiment of 15 bolts at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2784
02:01:27.630 --> 02:01:28.463
<v Speaker 2>before you know it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're throwing 450 volts and it is </v>

2785
02:01:30.221 --> 02:01:31.054
<v Speaker 2>subject.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't get somebody to do that </v>

2786
02:01:32.471 --> 02:01:34.450
<v Speaker 2>initially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you do it incrementally,</v>

2787
02:01:35.020 --> 02:01:35.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2788
02:01:35.460 --> 02:01:36.640
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the kind of hoping,</v>

2789
02:01:36.641 --> 02:01:39.890
<v Speaker 2>well if I hold out and just do one more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe the end.</v>

2790
02:01:40.370 --> 02:01:43.700
<v Speaker 1>And it's like this with these kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>utilitarian calculus.</v>

2791
02:01:43.701 --> 02:01:44.534
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I probably shouldn't be doing </v>

2792
02:01:45.171 --> 02:01:45.750
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2793
02:01:45.750 --> 02:01:48.080
<v Speaker 1>these collateral damage or the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if we can.</v>

2794
02:01:48.370 --> 02:01:49.203
<v Speaker 1>But if we keep going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll end the war and then that'll stop </v>

2795
02:01:50.751 --> 02:01:53.930
<v Speaker 1>the other kind of killing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do want to stop but it.</v>

2796
02:01:53.960 --> 02:01:57.230
<v Speaker 1>But it's always so messy that it takes </v>
<v Speaker 1>much longer than you think.</v>

2797
02:01:57.231 --> 02:01:59.710
<v Speaker 1>So you can kind of see the logic like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2798
02:02:00.430 --> 02:02:02.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you watch Ken Burns' </v>
<v Speaker 1>documentary series,</v>

2799
02:02:02.480 --> 02:02:03.313
<v Speaker 1>the Vietnam War,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it kind of felt like that the whole </v>

2800
02:02:04.971 --> 02:02:07.520
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this is when we see at the end,</v>

2801
02:02:07.521 --> 02:02:09.260
<v Speaker 1>it's like God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was like a task strappy,</v>

2802
02:02:09.830 --> 02:02:11.030
<v Speaker 1>but at every step,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2803
02:02:11.031 --> 02:02:13.550
<v Speaker 1>Kennedy than Johnson and Nixon is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2804
02:02:13.580 --> 02:02:15.100
<v Speaker 1>we can't give up now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2805
02:02:15.110 --> 02:02:16.400
<v Speaker 1>the sunk cost fallacy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2806
02:02:16.401 --> 02:02:17.234
<v Speaker 1>we put all this in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just one more month and then we'll get </v>

2807
02:02:20.811 --> 02:02:22.670
<v Speaker 1>out and then the month comes like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2808
02:02:22.671 --> 02:02:25.700
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to wait another month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another year.</v>

2809
02:02:25.701 --> 02:02:26.451
<v Speaker 1>And then before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2810
02:02:26.451 --> 02:02:29.930
<v Speaker 1>you got 58,000 dead and it's like okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this just didn't work.</v>

2811
02:02:30.560 --> 02:02:33.470
<v Speaker 1>And I think that happens more often </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's always messier.</v>

2812
02:02:33.830 --> 02:02:35.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes sense.</v>

2813
02:02:35.661 --> 02:02:36.494
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>war itself is an incredibly messy </v>

2814
02:02:38.331 --> 02:02:39.164
<v Speaker 2>business.</v>

2815
02:02:39.540 --> 02:02:40.180
<v Speaker 1>Do you know it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2816
02:02:40.180 --> 02:02:41.013
<v Speaker 1>it's outlawed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was outlawed in the Paris peace </v>

2817
02:02:42.781 --> 02:02:44.250
<v Speaker 1>agreements of 19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>27.</v>

2818
02:02:44.490 --> 02:02:45.323
<v Speaker 1>War is illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a great book called the </v>

2819
02:02:47.911 --> 02:02:48.744
<v Speaker 1>internationalists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gives the history of how this came </v>

2820
02:02:50.461 --> 02:02:51.294
<v Speaker 1>about and that and the reason for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they gave them the whole history </v>

2821
02:02:54.991 --> 02:02:55.824
<v Speaker 1>going all the way back to when war </v>
<v Speaker 1>became legal and it goes all the way </v>

2822
02:02:57.931 --> 02:02:59.720
<v Speaker 1>back to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2823
02:03:00.210 --> 02:03:02.760
<v Speaker 1>Spanish and Dutch conflict they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>having.</v>

2824
02:03:02.761 --> 02:03:03.594
<v Speaker 1>And I forget who did what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a Spanish ship confiscated a Dutch </v>

2825
02:03:06.361 --> 02:03:09.330
<v Speaker 1>ship and took all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2826
02:03:09.331 --> 02:03:12.810
<v Speaker 1>and then there was like a legal battle </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this and whichever side,</v>

2827
02:03:12.811 --> 02:03:13.920
<v Speaker 1>I think it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Spanish said,</v>

2828
02:03:14.200 --> 02:03:14.790
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2829
02:03:14.790 --> 02:03:16.020
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2830
02:03:16.030 --> 02:03:18.330
<v Speaker 1>we were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were at war and if you're at war,</v>

2831
02:03:18.331 --> 02:03:21.720
<v Speaker 1>it's okay to be a pirate and kill people</v>
<v Speaker 1>and stuff like that.</v>

2832
02:03:22.170 --> 02:03:23.670
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2833
02:03:23.850 --> 02:03:24.683
<v Speaker 1>this Hugo grosses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>legal scholar wrote all this treaties </v>

2834
02:03:27.360 --> 02:03:30.420
<v Speaker 1>that got laid down that said this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>when war is legal.</v>

2835
02:03:30.480 --> 02:03:35.460
<v Speaker 1>It's perfectly okay to kill other people</v>
<v Speaker 1>and take their stuff if you're at war.</v>

2836
02:03:35.490 --> 02:03:37.300
<v Speaker 1>So what does that mean to be a war?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2837
02:03:37.320 --> 02:03:38.850
<v Speaker 1>so then it's legal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all,</v>

2838
02:03:38.851 --> 02:03:40.230
<v Speaker 1>it's all done by lawyers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2839
02:03:40.231 --> 02:03:41.520
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what it is.</v>

2840
02:03:41.880 --> 02:03:44.460
<v Speaker 1>And we have lived with that ever since.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in the 19,</v>

2841
02:03:44.461 --> 02:03:46.210
<v Speaker 1>27,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Paris peace or even said,</v>

2842
02:03:46.211 --> 02:03:46.591
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2843
02:03:46.591 --> 02:03:47.424
<v Speaker 1>we're going to stop that war is illegal </v>
<v Speaker 1>now obviously this didn't stop Hitler </v>

2844
02:03:50.041 --> 02:03:50.874
<v Speaker 1>and imperial Japan and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at least now a leaders have to </v>

2845
02:03:54.601 --> 02:03:58.590
<v Speaker 1>justify it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a Bush had to go to the UN and</v>

2846
02:03:58.591 --> 02:04:02.550
<v Speaker 1>get his coalition of the willing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's when Colin Powell to say,</v>

2847
02:04:02.551 --> 02:04:03.384
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know about the yellow cake and that </v>

2848
02:04:05.280 --> 02:04:08.200
<v Speaker 1>Saddam Hussein wants nuclear weapons it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2849
02:04:08.220 --> 02:04:10.260
<v Speaker 1>why would anybody bother with all that </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff?</v>

2850
02:04:10.290 --> 02:04:12.640
<v Speaker 1>In the old days they just invade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2851
02:04:12.700 --> 02:04:13.411
<v Speaker 1>I came,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw,</v>

2852
02:04:13.411 --> 02:04:14.950
<v Speaker 1>I conquered it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>took my stuff,</v>

2853
02:04:15.020 --> 02:04:15.853
<v Speaker 1>and now you have to say I came,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw I was just standing there minding </v>

2854
02:04:17.851 --> 02:04:21.490
<v Speaker 1>my own business and he punched me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I invaded in.</v>

2855
02:04:22.290 --> 02:04:23.460
<v Speaker 1>You at least have to do that.</v>

2856
02:04:23.800 --> 02:04:27.520
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of like what we were talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about earlier that the world today,</v>

2857
02:04:27.550 --> 02:04:28.383
<v Speaker 2>I mean their consciously recognizing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there are more rules and that </v>

2858
02:04:32.471 --> 02:04:33.304
<v Speaker 2>society is a much more complex and safer</v>
<v Speaker 2>place to be and they want to protect </v>

2859
02:04:37.110 --> 02:04:37.943
<v Speaker 2>that progress in some way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what the rules of war in </v>

2860
02:04:40.951 --> 02:04:43.000
<v Speaker 2>comparison to 2000 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2861
02:04:43.770 --> 02:04:45.200
<v Speaker 2>So that's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2862
02:04:46.020 --> 02:04:47.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't stop everybody,</v>

2863
02:04:47.581 --> 02:04:49.020
<v Speaker 2>but even Kim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>John Wooten,</v>

2864
02:04:49.021 --> 02:04:53.880
<v Speaker 2>I kind of have a feeling that maybe I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>naive that it's just deterrent for him.</v>

2865
02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.910
<v Speaker 2>He wants to take a place at the table </v>
<v Speaker 2>where he's respected.</v>

2866
02:04:56.911 --> 02:05:00.120
<v Speaker 2>His country is not going to be invaded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2867
02:05:00.121 --> 02:05:00.954
<v Speaker 2>this is sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Noam Chomsky argument that I usually </v>

2868
02:05:03.181 --> 02:05:04.014
<v Speaker 2>make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you look at how America treats </v>

2869
02:05:06.151 --> 02:05:08.100
<v Speaker 2>other countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they have nukes,</v>

2870
02:05:08.160 --> 02:05:09.930
<v Speaker 2>we leave them alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they don't,</v>

2871
02:05:09.931 --> 02:05:11.820
<v Speaker 2>we do whatever we kind of feel like.</v>

2872
02:05:12.110 --> 02:05:12.943
<v Speaker 2>So from his perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could be those Americans because you </v>

2873
02:05:15.990 --> 02:05:17.610
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they make arguments like this,</v>

2874
02:05:17.611 --> 02:05:19.410
<v Speaker 2>these Americans are evil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

2875
02:05:19.440 --> 02:05:21.590
<v Speaker 2>Look they invaded this country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They made that they've been in,</v>

2876
02:05:21.591 --> 02:05:24.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a dozen wars and just never ending.</v>

2877
02:05:24.390 --> 02:05:27.420
<v Speaker 2>This is who they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to get new books and they're</v>

2878
02:05:27.430 --> 02:05:29.490
<v Speaker 2>gonna they're not gonna fuck with this </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever again.</v>

2879
02:05:29.970 --> 02:05:31.620
<v Speaker 2>And maybe that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe he'll just stop and go,</v>

2880
02:05:31.621 --> 02:05:32.281
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2881
02:05:32.281 --> 02:05:33.990
<v Speaker 2>You leave me alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll leave you alone.</v>

2882
02:05:34.050 --> 02:05:36.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't agree with Noam Chomsky on </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>

2883
02:05:36.061 --> 02:05:36.894
<v Speaker 2>but I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very happy there's someone like him </v>

2884
02:05:39.180 --> 02:05:44.180
<v Speaker 2>out there who's a brilliant guy that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>as far left as you can get.</v>

2885
02:05:44.870 --> 02:05:46.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's way out there.</v>

2886
02:05:46.951 --> 02:05:51.951
<v Speaker 2>I think it's important to balance these </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectual disagreements and you know,</v>

2887
02:05:52.261 --> 02:05:56.290
<v Speaker 2>you need a super smart far left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He guy wearing a sweater.</v>

2888
02:05:56.550 --> 02:05:57.620
<v Speaker 2>Excellent moves.</v>

2889
02:06:02.150 --> 02:06:03.010
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2890
02:06:03.340 --> 02:06:04.173
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's why we have to have free </v>

2891
02:06:05.581 --> 02:06:09.110
<v Speaker 2>speech and open dialogue and debate with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy over here to counter the guy,</v>

2892
02:06:09.120 --> 02:06:09.953
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's my instead of like </v>

2893
02:06:11.880 --> 02:06:14.190
<v Speaker 2>authoritarian left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well why are they there?</v>

2894
02:06:14.191 --> 02:06:15.660
<v Speaker 2>Because there's an authoritarian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2895
02:06:15.750 --> 02:06:16.583
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is we expect that from the </v>

2896
02:06:17.731 --> 02:06:18.564
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is why we're going through what </v>

2897
02:06:20.271 --> 02:06:21.930
<v Speaker 2>we're going through now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of a surprise.</v>

2898
02:06:21.931 --> 02:06:23.300
<v Speaker 2>Wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The liberals are doing this.</v>

2899
02:06:23.340 --> 02:06:24.570
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fairly recent.</v>

2900
02:06:24.660 --> 02:06:25.493
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know the silencing of people you </v>

2901
02:06:26.731 --> 02:06:27.564
<v Speaker 2>disagree with and also the really </v>
<v Speaker 2>disingenuous labeling of people's Nazis </v>

2902
02:06:33.600 --> 02:06:34.433
<v Speaker 2>or a neo Nazis are white supremacist </v>
<v Speaker 2>just because they simply don't line up </v>

2903
02:06:37.741 --> 02:06:42.741
<v Speaker 2>with your beliefs of state and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscious decision to do that.</v>

2904
02:06:44.160 --> 02:06:46.950
<v Speaker 2>It's this isn't like an accidental </v>
<v Speaker 2>mislabeling,</v>

2905
02:06:46.951 --> 02:06:49.200
<v Speaker 2>we don't really know what the person's </v>
<v Speaker 2>motives and who they are.</v>

2906
02:06:49.400 --> 02:06:50.233
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just trying to diminish whatever </v>

2907
02:06:51.331 --> 02:06:52.164
<v Speaker 2>position they have so that your side </v>
<v Speaker 2>wins and I think a lot of people feel </v>

2908
02:06:56.491 --> 02:06:57.324
<v Speaker 2>justified by it because of the current </v>
<v Speaker 2>administration and it just seems like </v>

2909
02:07:01.560 --> 02:07:03.390
<v Speaker 2>we're on a God damn pirate ship now.</v>

2910
02:07:03.940 --> 02:07:04.773
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems like when you're seeing what's </v>

2911
02:07:07.951 --> 02:07:12.350
<v Speaker 2>going on with the erosion of the EPA and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the decision to start drooling,</v>

2912
02:07:12.380 --> 02:07:13.213
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he made a sweeping decision that you </v>

2913
02:07:14.941 --> 02:07:16.310
<v Speaker 2>could drill anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2914
02:07:16.590 --> 02:07:17.930
<v Speaker 2>Go ahead offshore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go ahead.</v>

2915
02:07:18.210 --> 02:07:22.140
<v Speaker 2>Just start drilling that ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fish oil baby.</v>

2916
02:07:22.200 --> 02:07:25.350
<v Speaker 2>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be in my gold bathroom.</v>

2917
02:07:27.090 --> 02:07:30.450
<v Speaker 2>Giant gold chandelier over the toilet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guy Is crazy.</v>

2918
02:07:30.451 --> 02:07:34.320
<v Speaker 2>It's just a strange time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like something out of a movie.</v>

2919
02:07:34.380 --> 02:07:37.090
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's way crazier than something out of a</v>

2920
02:07:37.091 --> 02:07:37.924
<v Speaker 2>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there was a president that was this </v>

2921
02:07:39.400 --> 02:07:41.320
<v Speaker 2>nuts in a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would say,</v>

2922
02:07:41.321 --> 02:07:42.154
<v Speaker 2>that's too over the top.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We played a video yesterday of trump </v>

2923
02:07:45.040 --> 02:07:50.040
<v Speaker 2>that looked at 24 different things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>trump said he was the best at nobody.</v>

2924
02:07:50.410 --> 02:07:53.050
<v Speaker 2>Nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody loves women more than I do.</v>

2925
02:07:53.290 --> 02:07:55.560
<v Speaker 2>Nobody loves Mexicans more than I do and</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody.</v>

2926
02:07:56.920 --> 02:07:57.753
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's better at foreign policy than </v>
<v Speaker 2>trump uses himself in the third person </v>

2927
02:08:02.430 --> 02:08:03.263
<v Speaker 2>who saw like oprah as a president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can we just have like professional </v>

2928
02:08:07.900 --> 02:08:11.260
<v Speaker 2>experts that work in this area that know</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they're doing,</v>

2929
02:08:11.560 --> 02:08:13.180
<v Speaker 2>even if they're not celebrities?</v>

2930
02:08:13.260 --> 02:08:13.551
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

2931
02:08:13.551 --> 02:08:18.551
<v Speaker 2>I'm a firm believer that that position </v>
<v Speaker 2>is almost always abused and that will,</v>

2932
02:08:19.381 --> 02:08:20.214
<v Speaker 2>we really need instead of like one </v>
<v Speaker 2>person is like a council of why the </v>

2933
02:08:24.850 --> 02:08:29.850
<v Speaker 2>tribunal or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>18 super smart people that have to write</v>

2934
02:08:30.851 --> 02:08:34.780
<v Speaker 2>papers on all these different decisions </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they make and I'd be happy with it.</v>

2935
02:08:34.840 --> 02:08:37.030
<v Speaker 2>With the tribe instead of a president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have three people,</v>

2936
02:08:37.110 --> 02:08:40.060
<v Speaker 2>you elect him and then for anything to </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen to it,</v>

2937
02:08:40.061 --> 02:08:43.720
<v Speaker 2>the three have to agree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even three because the FCC,</v>

2938
02:08:43.810 --> 02:08:44.643
<v Speaker 2>they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They took out net and it was only five </v>

2939
02:08:47.741 --> 02:08:50.020
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Five unelected people.</v>

2940
02:08:50.021 --> 02:08:50.831
<v Speaker 2>That's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2941
02:08:50.831 --> 02:08:51.550
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2942
02:08:51.550 --> 02:08:52.600
<v Speaker 2>Maybe 18.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2943
02:08:52.960 --> 02:08:55.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

2944
02:08:56.170 --> 02:08:57.810
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need an odd number so you don't have</v>

2945
02:08:58.170 --> 02:09:00.100
<v Speaker 2>a tie breaker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2946
02:09:00.101 --> 02:09:04.360
<v Speaker 2>We had Jessica Rosenworcel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his last name from the FCC,</v>

2947
02:09:04.361 --> 02:09:08.440
<v Speaker 2>she was one of the five that voted for </v>
<v Speaker 2>net neutrality.</v>

2948
02:09:08.440 --> 02:09:11.890
<v Speaker 2>She wanted to keep it in place and she </v>
<v Speaker 2>was on two weeks ago,</v>

2949
02:09:12.070 --> 02:09:12.903
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And describing to us like what the </v>

2950
02:09:15.701 --> 02:09:16.534
<v Speaker 2>situation is like and how there's only </v>
<v Speaker 2>five people and they're not elected and </v>

2951
02:09:20.261 --> 02:09:22.600
<v Speaker 2>they get to decide how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did they get that?</v>

2952
02:09:22.740 --> 02:09:24.760
<v Speaker 2>They're appointed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>appointed by the president.</v>

2953
02:09:25.240 --> 02:09:26.073
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if they're appointed by </v>

2954
02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:33.000
<v Speaker 2>trump or maybe they are holdovers from </v>
<v Speaker 2>apparently easy to stack.</v>

2955
02:09:34.420 --> 02:09:37.630
<v Speaker 2>Is that what she said?</v>
<v Speaker 2>President Obama or trump says,</v>

2956
02:09:37.631 --> 02:09:39.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>appointed by the president and confirmed</v>

2957
02:09:39.431 --> 02:09:41.710
<v Speaker 2>by the Senate for five year terms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2958
02:09:41.830 --> 02:09:43.690
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these are new folks then.</v>

2959
02:09:44.180 --> 02:09:45.340
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2960
02:09:45.400 --> 02:09:46.730
<v Speaker 2>And they decided,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2961
02:09:46.960 --> 02:09:48.570
<v Speaker 2>let's just give all the money in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>corporation.</v>

2962
02:09:48.571 --> 02:09:53.571
<v Speaker 2>So instead them just block websites and </v>
<v Speaker 2>get crazy with throttling in writing.</v>

2963
02:09:54.460 --> 02:09:56.920
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird time for this.</v>

2964
02:09:57.160 --> 02:09:58.360
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2965
02:09:58.390 --> 02:10:02.560
<v Speaker 2>So back to the utopia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Societies are messy and the only,</v>

2966
02:10:02.830 --> 02:10:06.790
<v Speaker 2>the only Utopian type system would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>one that there is no system.</v>

2967
02:10:07.680 --> 02:10:08.513
<v Speaker 2>You'd have checks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just nothing but checks and balances </v>

2968
02:10:09.851 --> 02:10:12.640
<v Speaker 2>because these catch basins of power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

2969
02:10:12.641 --> 02:10:13.474
<v Speaker 2>back to the colts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they inevitably form and anybody wants </v>

2970
02:10:16.870 --> 02:10:20.380
<v Speaker 2>more power if they can get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just human nature,</v>

2971
02:10:20.381 --> 02:10:21.280
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's human nature.</v>

2972
02:10:21.281 --> 02:10:26.170
<v Speaker 2>You it go back to where we're social </v>
<v Speaker 2>primates bases.</v>

2973
02:10:26.680 --> 02:10:28.150
<v Speaker 2>The alpha male is going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he can get there,</v>

2974
02:10:28.151 --> 02:10:28.984
<v Speaker 2>he's going to stay there for as long as </v>
<v Speaker 2>he can and the Beta males are going to </v>

2975
02:10:31.091 --> 02:10:36.091
<v Speaker 2>try to under undermine and from out from</v>
<v Speaker 2>underneath this constant struggle.</v>

2976
02:10:36.470 --> 02:10:38.570
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are two kinds of men.</v>

2977
02:10:38.810 --> 02:10:43.810
<v Speaker 2>Those would loaded revolvers and those </v>
<v Speaker 2>who did so well.</v>

2978
02:10:45.801 --> 02:10:47.150
<v Speaker 2>That's why you know this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

2979
02:10:47.270 --> 02:10:48.103
<v Speaker 2>sort of a horizontal bottom up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Networking systems is one way to try to </v>

2980
02:10:53.300 --> 02:10:55.880
<v Speaker 2>counter the hierarchical power </v>
<v Speaker 2>structures.</v>

2981
02:10:55.970 --> 02:10:57.500
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't always work,</v>

2982
02:10:57.501 --> 02:10:58.334
<v Speaker 2>but now as someone who spends so much </v>
<v Speaker 2>time looking for actual truth and facts </v>

2983
02:11:04.041 --> 02:11:04.874
<v Speaker 2>and scientific data,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how concerned are you about the media </v>

2984
02:11:08.931 --> 02:11:09.380
<v Speaker 2>today?</v>

2985
02:11:09.380 --> 02:11:11.870
<v Speaker 2>Because this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this term fake news,</v>

2986
02:11:13.250 --> 02:11:14.083
<v Speaker 2>weird world of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of attacks on journalism and then even </v>

2987
02:11:18.981 --> 02:11:23.981
<v Speaker 2>journalism itself falling short and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>journalism in many venues trying to keep</v>

2988
02:11:24.981 --> 02:11:25.814
<v Speaker 2>up with the Internet and putting out </v>
<v Speaker 2>these salacious click baity headlines </v>

2989
02:11:29.691 --> 02:11:34.440
<v Speaker 2>even like established media sources or </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing some sleazy shit now.</v>

2990
02:11:34.670 --> 02:11:36.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a concern for sure.</v>

2991
02:11:36.110 --> 02:11:39.650
<v Speaker 2>We have stay on top of it but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are solutions to this,</v>

2992
02:11:39.651 --> 02:11:40.484
<v Speaker 2>like politifact for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they're not the only site snopes </v>

2993
02:11:43.281 --> 02:11:48.281
<v Speaker 2>also ranking the factual basis of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech in real time.</v>

2994
02:11:49.190 --> 02:11:50.023
<v Speaker 2>And you can go on like politifact is </v>
<v Speaker 2>trump's given a speech or during the </v>

2995
02:11:52.760 --> 02:11:55.790
<v Speaker 2>campaign when they were all giving </v>
<v Speaker 2>speeches and they would rank them,</v>

2996
02:11:55.840 --> 02:11:56.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>

2997
02:11:56.400 --> 02:11:57.111
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>

2998
02:11:57.111 --> 02:11:59.150
<v Speaker 2>Mostly true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>partially false,</v>

2999
02:11:59.151 --> 02:12:00.680
<v Speaker 2>mostly faults,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pants on fire.</v>

3000
02:12:01.470 --> 02:12:03.920
<v Speaker 2>I love their ranking system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

3001
02:12:03.921 --> 02:12:04.491
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump,</v>

3002
02:12:04.491 --> 02:12:06.080
<v Speaker 2>trump got a lot of pants on fire.</v>

3003
02:12:06.420 --> 02:12:07.253
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3004
02:12:07.430 --> 02:12:08.263
<v Speaker 2>so at least there's a counter to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now those sites are becoming pretty </v>

3005
02:12:11.961 --> 02:12:12.950
<v Speaker 2>popular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3006
02:12:13.400 --> 02:12:15.500
<v Speaker 2>they're kind of a form of clickbait </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>

3007
02:12:15.501 --> 02:12:19.580
<v Speaker 2>Let's go there and find out how many </v>
<v Speaker 2>times this guy lied in his speech.</v>

3008
02:12:19.581 --> 02:12:20.414
<v Speaker 2>So it would have been nice if we </v>
<v Speaker 2>would've had that say in the Nixon </v>

3009
02:12:22.671 --> 02:12:25.760
<v Speaker 2>administration or the Johnson </v>
<v Speaker 2>administration like the Gulf of Tonkin,</v>

3010
02:12:25.761 --> 02:12:26.850
<v Speaker 2>if this could have been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3011
02:12:27.210 --> 02:12:28.043
<v Speaker 2>a whistleblower and in called and put </v>
<v Speaker 2>out there so that we didn't drag </v>

3012
02:12:31.411 --> 02:12:33.560
<v Speaker 2>yourselves into the Vietnam war even </v>
<v Speaker 2>deeper.</v>

3013
02:12:33.890 --> 02:12:36.230
<v Speaker 2>My thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is a very,</v>

3014
02:12:36.290 --> 02:12:37.123
<v Speaker 2>a paranoid thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that all this is inevitably opening </v>

3015
02:12:41.421 --> 02:12:45.170
<v Speaker 2>us up to the truth chip to the mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reading the chip.</v>

3016
02:12:45.180 --> 02:12:48.140
<v Speaker 2>But if things are going to get so </v>
<v Speaker 2>chaotic that we're going to say,</v>

3017
02:12:48.141 --> 02:12:49.910
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just hit me with the chip.</v>

3018
02:12:49.911 --> 02:12:51.970
<v Speaker 2>I can't fucking take this anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who's right.</v>

3019
02:12:51.980 --> 02:12:56.430
<v Speaker 2>Fox News says one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>CNN says another slide it in slide.</v>

3020
02:12:56.460 --> 02:12:57.650
<v Speaker 2>I want in my forearm right here.</v>

3021
02:13:00.640 --> 02:13:02.330
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Solution.</v>

3022
02:13:02.540 --> 02:13:03.373
<v Speaker 2>It might literally be like nature's way </v>
<v Speaker 2>of allowing us to slowly accept the </v>

3023
02:13:08.031 --> 02:13:12.620
<v Speaker 2>symbiotic relationships with this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This new artificial intelligence.</v>

3024
02:13:13.340 --> 02:13:15.500
<v Speaker 2>I think webster's just this last week </v>
<v Speaker 2>voted,</v>

3025
02:13:15.501 --> 02:13:16.334
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was alternative facts is the word of </v>

3026
02:13:17.661 --> 02:13:21.110
<v Speaker 2>the year phrase of the year for 2017 for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the year before that,</v>

3027
02:13:21.111 --> 02:13:21.944
<v Speaker 2>it was fake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fake news with Sean Spicer said </v>

3028
02:13:23.451 --> 02:13:24.530
<v Speaker 2>alternative facts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3029
02:13:24.531 --> 02:13:29.531
<v Speaker 2>It was forced to try to like Kellyanne </v>
<v Speaker 2>conway after the inaugural.</v>

3030
02:13:30.400 --> 02:13:31.170
<v Speaker 2>A,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3031
02:13:31.170 --> 02:13:33.380
<v Speaker 2>size of the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3032
02:13:33.820 --> 02:13:34.653
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3033
02:13:34.730 --> 02:13:35.800
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at a picture.</v>

3034
02:13:35.830 --> 02:13:38.150
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not as big as a.</v>

3035
02:13:38.220 --> 02:13:38.770
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where.</v>

3036
02:13:38.770 --> 02:13:40.890
<v Speaker 2>Did you get that number?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was an alternative fact.</v>

3037
02:13:41.350 --> 02:13:42.183
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They seem to like keep her locked up </v>

3038
02:13:43.891 --> 02:13:47.160
<v Speaker 2>more now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She seems to be less less.</v>

3039
02:13:47.250 --> 02:13:49.320
<v Speaker 2>She just keeps stuffing her foot in her </v>
<v Speaker 2>mouth.</v>

3040
02:13:49.670 --> 02:13:50.401
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3041
02:13:50.401 --> 02:13:54.000
<v Speaker 2>they all have to because the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>boss sends him out to tell them this.</v>

3042
02:13:54.001 --> 02:13:54.360
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3043
02:13:54.360 --> 02:13:59.360
<v Speaker 2>Can you imagine that's poor Sean Spicer </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy when he talks about it now it's like</v>

3044
02:13:59.461 --> 02:14:01.780
<v Speaker 2>a guy who's just been freed from prison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3045
02:14:02.600 --> 02:14:03.433
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's probably making a lot of money on </v>

3046
02:14:03.991 --> 02:14:05.700
<v Speaker 2>the lecture circuit now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3047
02:14:05.701 --> 02:14:06.960
<v Speaker 2>I can imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3048
02:14:06.961 --> 02:14:08.610
<v Speaker 2>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably a very lucrative,</v>

3049
02:14:10.080 --> 02:14:11.420
<v Speaker 2>but if you look at governments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3050
02:14:11.460 --> 02:14:13.260
<v Speaker 2>centuries past or thousands of years </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>

3051
02:14:13.261 --> 02:14:13.681
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3052
02:14:13.681 --> 02:14:16.080
<v Speaker 2>there was lying and corruption and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

3053
02:14:16.130 --> 02:14:16.880
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

3054
02:14:16.880 --> 02:14:17.840
<v Speaker 2>that's old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3055
02:14:18.240 --> 02:14:21.420
<v Speaker 2>It's just now it's so blatant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the yellow press.</v>

3056
02:14:21.421 --> 02:14:22.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where did that come from?</v>

3057
02:14:22.771 --> 02:14:23.341
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3058
02:14:23.341 --> 02:14:24.930
<v Speaker 2>the whoever told.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3059
02:14:24.931 --> 02:14:26.160
<v Speaker 2>it was hearst,</v>
<v Speaker 2>William Randolph.</v>

3060
02:14:26.170 --> 02:14:30.840
<v Speaker 2>First you gave me the war and I'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>supply you the photographs or whatever.</v>

3061
02:14:31.380 --> 02:14:33.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know that that's fake news.</v>

3062
02:14:34.130 --> 02:14:37.410
<v Speaker 2>That's literally affect news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The sinking of the Maine.</v>

3063
02:14:37.411 --> 02:14:38.560
<v Speaker 2>Let's go to war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3064
02:14:38.690 --> 02:14:42.120
<v Speaker 2>you know what actually happened again?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gulf of Tonkin.</v>

3065
02:14:42.150 --> 02:14:42.983
<v Speaker 2>Gulf of Tonkin.</v>

3066
02:14:43.010 --> 02:14:44.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That Vietnam War.</v>

3067
02:14:44.401 --> 02:14:46.590
<v Speaker 2>Documentary series.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just wanted to put my head in the oven</v>

3068
02:14:46.591 --> 02:14:48.260
<v Speaker 2>after that and turn the gas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3069
02:14:48.540 --> 02:14:50.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this went on for so long,</v>

3070
02:14:50.701 --> 02:14:52.950
<v Speaker 2>so many years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did we in Afghanistan,</v>

3071
02:14:52.951 --> 02:14:54.840
<v Speaker 2>I was 16 years now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vietnam war.</v>

3072
02:14:54.841 --> 02:14:57.990
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't quite that long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you look back to where it started</v>

3073
02:14:57.991 --> 02:15:00.450
<v Speaker 2>in the fifties when we.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We weren't at war,</v>

3074
02:15:00.451 --> 02:15:02.490
<v Speaker 2>we were sending advisors there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3075
02:15:03.390 --> 02:15:05.400
<v Speaker 2>this kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a,</v>

3076
02:15:05.401 --> 02:15:06.234
<v Speaker 2>it's so depressing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We like to think of our government is </v>

3077
02:15:08.371 --> 02:15:10.410
<v Speaker 2>having enough checks and balances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we need more.</v>

3078
02:15:10.710 --> 02:15:11.543
<v Speaker 2>I would like to think of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization as being something that </v>

3079
02:15:14.821 --> 02:15:15.654
<v Speaker 2>aspires to a higher standard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some like something that is more </v>

3080
02:15:19.291 --> 02:15:20.124
<v Speaker 2>advanced because we've learned from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>lessons of the thousands of years of </v>

3081
02:15:22.321 --> 02:15:27.321
<v Speaker 2>written history and we we aspire to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>greater set of values.</v>

3082
02:15:28.470 --> 02:15:30.180
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things I like about Elon </v>
<v Speaker 2>Musk's,</v>

3083
02:15:30.210 --> 02:15:33.990
<v Speaker 2>let's go colonize Mars in addition to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the technological problems.</v>

3084
02:15:34.140 --> 02:15:36.270
<v Speaker 2>How will they set up lift?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's 100 people.</v>

3085
02:15:36.271 --> 02:15:37.920
<v Speaker 2>There are a thousand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10,000.</v>

3086
02:15:38.310 --> 02:15:39.780
<v Speaker 2>What kind of government are they going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to have?</v>

3087
02:15:39.781 --> 02:15:43.140
<v Speaker 2>What kind of me just maniacs and we'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

3088
02:15:43.141 --> 02:15:43.974
<v Speaker 2>It was so crazy to die on Mars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably not going to be your </v>

3089
02:15:47.581 --> 02:15:48.414
<v Speaker 2>average typical a human.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You imagine you're going to take a six </v>

3090
02:15:53.071 --> 02:15:53.904
<v Speaker 2>month spaceship visit through through </v>
<v Speaker 2>the cosmos to land on a planet that </v>

3091
02:15:58.351 --> 02:16:01.260
<v Speaker 2>you're going to die on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You will never come back coming back,</v>

3092
02:16:01.680 --> 02:16:02.513
<v Speaker 2>unless they are so smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They figure out a way to build a rocket </v>

3093
02:16:05.730 --> 02:16:09.060
<v Speaker 2>and shoot back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which they probably won't know but that.</v>

3094
02:16:09.061 --> 02:16:10.460
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you went in,</v>

3095
02:16:10.470 --> 02:16:13.540
<v Speaker 2>you were advising like what kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>government would you set up or you know,</v>

3096
02:16:13.590 --> 02:16:14.423
<v Speaker 2>sort of social organization to prevent </v>
<v Speaker 2>people from stealing other people's </v>

3097
02:16:17.431 --> 02:16:22.431
<v Speaker 2>stuff that we got to work cooperatively </v>
<v Speaker 2>to plant a potato things and question,</v>

3098
02:16:23.370 --> 02:16:24.930
<v Speaker 2>how do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3099
02:16:24.960 --> 02:16:26.940
<v Speaker 2>we have thousands of years of </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiments,</v>

3100
02:16:26.941 --> 02:16:27.774
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3101
02:16:27.990 --> 02:16:29.650
<v Speaker 2>they're all messy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3102
02:16:30.010 --> 02:16:31.030
<v Speaker 1>No one's ever done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3103
02:16:31.031 --> 02:16:33.250
<v Speaker 1>Which is again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the utopian.</v>

3104
02:16:33.251 --> 02:16:33.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3105
02:16:33.960 --> 02:16:35.150
<v Speaker 1>is it different to have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3106
02:16:35.230 --> 02:16:36.520
<v Speaker 1>10 people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 people,</v>

3107
02:16:36.521 --> 02:16:37.680
<v Speaker 1>1000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10,000,</v>

3108
02:16:37.681 --> 02:16:38.514
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a scaling effect where it </v>

3109
02:16:40.961 --> 02:16:42.790
<v Speaker 1>becomes more efficient the more people </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have.</v>

3110
02:16:42.791 --> 02:16:44.560
<v Speaker 1>But on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you get these power,</v>

3111
02:16:44.770 --> 02:16:45.603
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>catch basins of power that grow and </v>

3112
02:16:46.961 --> 02:16:49.600
<v Speaker 1>become corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's gotTa happen on Mars.</v>

3113
02:16:49.690 --> 02:16:50.523
<v Speaker 1>It's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also the community gets fractured </v>

3114
02:16:52.151 --> 02:16:55.060
<v Speaker 1>because you don't know these people </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore and you get 5,000 people.</v>

3115
02:16:55.061 --> 02:16:56.770
<v Speaker 1>There's no way you can know 5,000 </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

3116
02:16:57.120 --> 02:16:58.230
<v Speaker 1>$500.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3117
02:16:58.270 --> 02:16:59.320
<v Speaker 1>There's Mike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey Mike.</v>

3118
02:16:59.370 --> 02:17:00.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right sally.</v>

3119
02:17:01.270 --> 02:17:03.580
<v Speaker 1>You know those people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get 5,000.</v>

3120
02:17:03.581 --> 02:17:05.470
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's that guy just flew here?</v>

3121
02:17:05.650 --> 02:17:06.830
<v Speaker 1>He's from Chicago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

3122
02:17:06.831 --> 02:17:09.430
<v Speaker 1>those on Mars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

3123
02:17:09.431 --> 02:17:12.460
<v Speaker 1>even small hunter gatherer groups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have conflicts all the time.</v>

3124
02:17:12.670 --> 02:17:16.990
<v Speaker 1>They get to sit down in the dirt area in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Commons ground and talk about it.</v>

3125
02:17:17.350 --> 02:17:20.980
<v Speaker 1>And then you stole this pig and the pig </v>
<v Speaker 1>died and now you alma pig.</v>

3126
02:17:21.010 --> 02:17:22.010
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go get your pick.</v>

3127
02:17:22.011 --> 02:17:22.990
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to settle it.</v>

3128
02:17:23.440 --> 02:17:25.500
<v Speaker 1>But what happens when someone dies?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3129
02:17:25.510 --> 02:17:26.021
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3130
02:17:26.021 --> 02:17:27.410
<v Speaker 1>you owe 10 pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3131
02:17:27.470 --> 02:17:29.650
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had these calculations like this is</v>

3132
02:17:29.710 --> 02:17:32.710
<v Speaker 1>the equivalent of a life is 10 pigs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3133
02:17:32.890 --> 02:17:35.740
<v Speaker 1>that's going to happen no matter what </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet we're living on.</v>

3134
02:17:36.880 --> 02:17:41.020
<v Speaker 1>Did you get any personal insight?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you do have to.</v>

3135
02:17:41.021 --> 02:17:43.540
<v Speaker 1>Every book you read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you read or you write rather.</v>

3136
02:17:43.870 --> 02:17:46.890
<v Speaker 1>But did you get any unique personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>insight into this?</v>

3137
02:17:46.900 --> 02:17:47.733
<v Speaker 1>I did at the last chapter is on what </v>
<v Speaker 1>does it mean to live a fulfilling on </v>

3138
02:17:51.250 --> 02:17:53.860
<v Speaker 1>inspiring happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fulfilled life?</v>

3139
02:17:54.070 --> 02:17:55.620
<v Speaker 1>If there's no afterlife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no god,</v>

3140
02:17:55.660 --> 02:17:56.950
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or even if there is,</v>

3141
02:17:56.951 --> 02:17:57.581
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

3142
02:17:57.581 --> 02:17:59.320
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't really matter because we live</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this world,</v>

3143
02:17:59.860 --> 02:18:04.240
<v Speaker 1>so it turns out there's research that </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows that striving for happiness is the</v>

3144
02:18:04.241 --> 02:18:05.560
<v Speaker 1>wrong metric.</v>

3145
02:18:05.560 --> 02:18:08.890
<v Speaker 1>That's the wrong goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that striving to live a purposeful,</v>

3146
02:18:08.891 --> 02:18:09.724
<v Speaker 1>meaningful life is what we should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>after and that often entails doing </v>

3147
02:18:12.851 --> 02:18:14.800
<v Speaker 1>things that don't make you happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not fun,</v>

3148
02:18:14.801 --> 02:18:17.470
<v Speaker 1>they're not pleasurable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like for example,</v>

3149
02:18:17.471 --> 02:18:18.460
<v Speaker 1>when you work out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3150
02:18:18.461 --> 02:18:21.880
<v Speaker 1>it's not fun and in a sense of like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>morphine drip,</v>

3151
02:18:21.881 --> 02:18:23.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting a lot of pleasure from this.</v>

3152
02:18:23.890 --> 02:18:24.723
<v Speaker 1>Afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a sense of endorphins and you </v>

3153
02:18:26.741 --> 02:18:29.290
<v Speaker 1>feel better about yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3154
02:18:29.410 --> 02:18:30.243
<v Speaker 1>and so like there's research showing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you go out for drinks with your </v>

3155
02:18:33.731 --> 02:18:35.740
<v Speaker 1>friends to enter and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fun.</v>

3156
02:18:35.741 --> 02:18:37.210
<v Speaker 1>It's pleasurable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's short term.</v>

3157
02:18:37.820 --> 02:18:40.450
<v Speaker 1>A caretaking for a parent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

3158
02:18:40.451 --> 02:18:43.240
<v Speaker 1>This shows that this is not fun at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done this.</v>

3159
02:18:43.420 --> 02:18:47.080
<v Speaker 1>Two of my four parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had step parents and this was not fun.</v>

3160
02:18:47.081 --> 02:18:48.760
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't pleasurable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't enjoy it,</v>

3161
02:18:48.920 --> 02:18:49.753
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>schlepping my dad around to doctors and </v>

3162
02:18:50.861 --> 02:18:53.650
<v Speaker 1>hospitals and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just drained by the end of the day</v>

3163
02:18:53.651 --> 02:18:55.840
<v Speaker 1>doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I felt better about myself.</v>

3164
02:18:56.290 --> 02:18:58.420
<v Speaker 1>So it turns out the research shows that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3165
02:18:58.510 --> 02:19:01.600
<v Speaker 1>if you have more longterm goals both </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward and back,</v>

3166
02:19:01.601 --> 02:19:04.180
<v Speaker 1>forward goals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back reflecting on your past,</v>

3167
02:19:04.181 --> 02:19:07.630
<v Speaker 1>what you've done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not oriented toward being happy,</v>

3168
02:19:07.631 --> 02:19:08.464
<v Speaker 1>but being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3169
02:19:08.530 --> 02:19:10.600
<v Speaker 1>sort of leading a purposeful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>driven life.</v>

3170
02:19:10.990 --> 02:19:13.810
<v Speaker 1>That's what makes people feel better </v>
<v Speaker 1>about their lives.</v>

3171
02:19:14.200 --> 02:19:16.660
<v Speaker 1>And really that's all we can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's enough.</v>

3172
02:19:16.690 --> 02:19:21.100
<v Speaker 1>It's enough to sort of feel like my life</v>
<v Speaker 1>was well worth living.</v>

3173
02:19:21.130 --> 02:19:24.510
<v Speaker 1>It's worth getting up in the morning </v>
<v Speaker 1>without the promise of an afterlife.</v>

3174
02:19:24.550 --> 02:19:27.380
<v Speaker 1>You don't need that just like this life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can make a difference.</v>

3175
02:19:27.381 --> 02:19:28.214
<v Speaker 1>I can get up this morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do something that I may not enjoy it </v>

3176
02:19:30.890 --> 02:19:31.980
<v Speaker 1>quite so much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

3177
02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:33.250
<v Speaker 1>working out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3178
02:19:33.251 --> 02:19:34.850
<v Speaker 1>like I do my three hour bike ride,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3179
02:19:34.851 --> 02:19:37.340
<v Speaker 1>it's so good to get up at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to get up at 6:30 in the morning.</v>

3180
02:19:37.340 --> 02:19:39.050
<v Speaker 1>They roll out at seven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's cold,</v>

3181
02:19:39.740 --> 02:19:40.573
<v Speaker 1>partially dark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like I got to bundle up and then </v>

3182
02:19:42.201 --> 02:19:43.034
<v Speaker 1>they gotta strip close off as I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I have to figure this all out and </v>

3183
02:19:45.811 --> 02:19:47.750
<v Speaker 1>it's not fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

3184
02:19:47.751 --> 02:19:48.800
<v Speaker 1>after,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after the ride I'm like,</v>

3185
02:19:49.060 --> 02:19:51.970
<v Speaker 1>I really feel great that I did this and </v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3186
02:19:52.810 --> 02:19:54.980
<v Speaker 1>I had fun with my buddies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not fun.</v>

3187
02:19:54.981 --> 02:19:56.010
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3188
02:19:56.120 --> 02:19:58.010
<v Speaker 1>I had a drink with my friends and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was fun.</v>

3189
02:19:58.011 --> 02:19:59.960
<v Speaker 1>That's a different kind of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

3190
02:20:00.160 --> 02:20:03.200
<v Speaker 1>And that funds okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two times balance,</v>

3191
02:20:03.230 --> 02:20:05.370
<v Speaker 1>but it shouldn't all be the fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3192
02:20:05.790 --> 02:20:07.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're full meaningful,</v>

3193
02:20:07.761 --> 02:20:09.290
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are people that do that.</v>

3194
02:20:09.620 --> 02:20:14.000
<v Speaker 1>So I talk about Diana Niad who I knew </v>
<v Speaker 1>back in the 19 eighties when I was doing</v>

3195
02:20:14.001 --> 02:20:14.834
<v Speaker 1>race across America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the transplant on a bike race and Diana </v>

3196
02:20:16.940 --> 02:20:19.200
<v Speaker 1>worked for why we're live sports and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they covered the race.</v>

3197
02:20:19.240 --> 02:20:20.073
<v Speaker 1>I would talk to her a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's in the back of the truck with the </v>

3198
02:20:21.401 --> 02:20:23.610
<v Speaker 1>camera crew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm riding along and uh,</v>

3199
02:20:23.660 --> 02:20:25.820
<v Speaker 1>she's a really interesting person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's an atheist,</v>

3200
02:20:26.330 --> 02:20:27.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she did the Cuba to Florida swim.</v>

3201
02:20:27.921 --> 02:20:28.754
<v Speaker 1>She's an ultra marathon swimmer and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she failed to make it back in her </v>

3202
02:20:32.061 --> 02:20:32.894
<v Speaker 1>twenties and she came back when she </v>
<v Speaker 1>turned 60 and said I'm going to go for </v>

3203
02:20:34.971 --> 02:20:36.620
<v Speaker 1>this again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

3204
02:20:36.710 --> 02:20:39.200
<v Speaker 1>it took her four years and I think for </v>
<v Speaker 1>tries to do it,</v>

3205
02:20:39.201 --> 02:20:40.034
<v Speaker 1>but she did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she appears on Oprah's super soul </v>

3206
02:20:42.591 --> 02:20:47.591
<v Speaker 1>Sunday show she had for awhile and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Oprah's asking her will,</v>

3207
02:20:48.230 --> 02:20:50.500
<v Speaker 1>how do you find on and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and meaning,</v>

3208
02:20:50.540 --> 02:20:51.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you believe?</v>

3209
02:20:51.921 --> 02:20:55.350
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm an atheist and she described how,</v>

3210
02:20:55.380 --> 02:20:56.213
<v Speaker 1>how are awestruck she is about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe and life and what science has </v>

3211
02:20:59.211 --> 02:20:59.600
<v Speaker 1>told us.</v>

3212
02:20:59.600 --> 02:21:01.100
<v Speaker 1>And Solomon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oprah says something like,</v>

3213
02:21:01.460 --> 02:21:03.620
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't see how you can be an atheist if</v>

3214
02:21:03.621 --> 02:21:05.320
<v Speaker 1>you're in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're on inspired.</v>

3215
02:21:05.350 --> 02:21:06.650
<v Speaker 1>And then she says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3216
02:21:06.760 --> 02:21:08.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't see why those are in </v>
<v Speaker 1>contradiction.</v>

3217
02:21:09.020 --> 02:21:09.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole,</v>

3218
02:21:09.570 --> 02:21:10.403
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>living a meaningful life and being </v>

3219
02:21:11.601 --> 02:21:15.200
<v Speaker 1>engaged in the world and other people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is spiritual,</v>

3220
02:21:15.201 --> 02:21:16.900
<v Speaker 1>that is inspiring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you know,</v>

3221
02:21:16.910 --> 02:21:17.743
<v Speaker 1>you don't need God for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was sort of an interesting </v>

3222
02:21:19.581 --> 02:21:23.900
<v Speaker 1>exchange because Uber's was reflecting </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of a common theme that people have.</v>

3223
02:21:23.901 --> 02:21:26.840
<v Speaker 1>You need God to have a meaningful life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Diana's whole point was,</v>

3224
02:21:26.841 --> 02:21:27.674
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't.</v>

3225
02:21:27.890 --> 02:21:31.100
<v Speaker 1>You just have to be engaged with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world in some meaningful way.</v>

3226
02:21:31.190 --> 02:21:33.440
<v Speaker 1>And that's enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And on that note,</v>

3227
02:21:33.920 --> 02:21:37.490
<v Speaker 1>Michael Shermer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heavens on earth,</v>

3228

<v Speaker 1>immortality and Utopia available now on </v>
