The joe rogan experience.
Joe Rogan podcast,
my night,

2
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.640
all day.
All right,
we're live,

3
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.040
Billy Corbin,
what are you doing?
Any tweeting,
you're texting.

4
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.910
You can't fucking do that while we're online online.
I can do that all the time.

5
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.710
I realize it doesn't matter how much of my life I spend tweeting and and at this

6
00:00:28.711 --> 00:00:32.360
point has been a significant percent and I've got,

7
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:37.080
I've got a cool little following,
but it did for what I dedicate and put into it.

8
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.630
I don't know that there,
the Roi is quite there,
right?

9
00:00:39.631 --> 00:00:42.120
Especially when I can just sit back on my ass and my,

10
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.990
my phone just blows up when they go,
dude,
are you listening to Rogan?

11
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.170
He's talking about cocaine cowboys again.
It's like I don't have to tweet Joe,

12
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.460
take care of it.
But like,
seriously,

13
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.700
the feedback that I get and the love that I get from people,

14
00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.220
you know,
your,
your audience,
your listenership is just off the charts.
Like the,

15
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:01.140
my,
my,
my,

16
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.140
my Twitter metrics dwarf in comparison to your listeners just hitting me up like

17
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.170
my,
my family.
Like,
are you listening to Rogan?
Are you listening to Rogan?

18
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.600
I'm like,
right now I'm working in with like,
no,
no,
you got it.
I'm like,

19
00:01:12.601 --> 00:01:14.010
don't you work in?
And they're like,
no,

20
00:01:14.011 --> 00:01:15.600
I'm listening to rogue and it will make a deal.

21
00:01:15.601 --> 00:01:19.440
You keep making awesome fucking documentaries.
I'll keep talking about them.

22
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.900
They'll keep getting out there,
dude.
I like that deal.
That's it.

23
00:01:21.901 --> 00:01:23.670
That's a hell of an arrangement as it went one day.

24
00:01:23.671 --> 00:01:27.420
You got to do a live remote from Miami though.
This town.
Dude,
I got to tell you,

25
00:01:27.421 --> 00:01:27.781
just like,

26
00:01:27.781 --> 00:01:31.860
like Miami more than you like La Tally Miami more than I like more than I like

27
00:01:31.861 --> 00:01:35.630
anything.
Uh,
honestly.
That's so weird.
Why is it,

28
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.320
cause you're smart.

29
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.640
Like you're really rare for a guy from Miami.

30
00:01:41.641 --> 00:01:43.800
I've always said that if you want to starve to death,

31
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.570
open up a bookstore in Miami,
it's a great way to starve to death.

32
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.180
It's true.
Well anywhere and you'll starve to death.
Actually.
Now,
maybe a kindle,

33
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.950
a kindle store.
But like I,
well I,
I get this,
this town,

34
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.240
this town,
which has been incidentally nothing but good to me my whole life.
Um,

35
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.760
Los Angeles,
I mean like broken hearts of fuel,

36
00:02:06.761 --> 00:02:10.470
the power grid and tears come out of the faucets.
Like I landed at lax,

37
00:02:10.471 --> 00:02:13.050
I turn it to Raymond fucking Shandler all of a sudden I just like,

38
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.510
I get really sad here.
I don't know what it's the,

39
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.430
it's the fucking homeless guy and pretty woman screaming on Hollywood boulevard.

40
00:02:19.431 --> 00:02:23.360
Like that's this,
that's this town to me.
Like just,
it's,

41
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.290
it's sad to me.
Miami is like,
I think Tony Montana said it best,
you know,

42
00:02:28.291 --> 00:02:31.170
it's just a great big pussy waiting to be fucking correct.
Big posts.
Yeah.

43
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.950
Miami is the city of the future and always will be.
You know,

44
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.000
there's just like endless opportunity there,
but it never quite gets to that,

45
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.010
that level.
The,
the,

46
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.280
the famous saying is it like a la is where you go when you want to be somebody

47
00:02:44.281 --> 00:02:47.400
in New York is where you go when you are somebody and Miami's where you go when

48
00:02:47.401 --> 00:02:49.830
you want to be somebody else.
So,

49
00:02:49.831 --> 00:02:53.970
and like that's the thesis of like all of our work in a way that's like the

50
00:02:53.971 --> 00:02:56.270
motto of our company of Racking tour.
That's,
that's like,

51
00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.530
it's too long to put on a tee shirt,
but it's like that's,
that's message.

52
00:02:59.531 --> 00:03:00.290
That's the takeaway

53
00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.120
<v 2>I guess.
Not too long.
We put it on tee shirts on.
Be worked out.
Yeah,
a small font.</v>

54
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.150
Good spacing.
Like we're designing it right now.
I could,

55
00:03:07.151 --> 00:03:09.640
that could be worked on your water.
A preorder right now folks.

56
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.560
I mean I obviously like it here in a lot of ways.

57
00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:17.620
What I don't like here is the amount of humans.
There's,

58
00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:18.970
there's just your quantity,

59
00:03:18.971 --> 00:03:23.170
overwhelming supply of human beings here to the point that I think that anytime

60
00:03:23.171 --> 00:03:27.550
you get too many people in one place,
you devalue those people.
It's like,

61
00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.460
I think that's the case with everything.
I mean,
I think if you're a guy,

62
00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.710
you have a million fucking girlfriends,

63
00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.480
they're all waiting for you in a warehouse.

64
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.960
You're not going to care if one of them dies.
You know?
You're just not,

65
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.860
you're just not,
you're barely gonna care.
If you,

66
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.550
if you have an airplane hangar filled with tens and you just walk in and you go,

67
00:03:45.551 --> 00:03:49.980
you in the back with the yellow hair come this way,
please your,
that's your,

68
00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:54.130
it doesn't mean anything.
If you have one wife that you love dearly,

69
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.800
it's going to mean a lot more if something happens to her.

70
00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.270
I think La has too many fucking people and I think the,

71
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.290
when you get too many people you,

72
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.170
there's this sort of weird things that happens where you stop caring about them.

73
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.190
He,
they don't mean anything to you,
but he's 28 years at quality.
Well,

74
00:04:12.191 --> 00:04:14.410
there's too many.
The quality is here.

75
00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.620
There's a lot of people that they're very important because we're all,

76
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:22.060
we're all to be fair.
The center of our own universe.
I mean,
but like everybody,

77
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.960
like everybody,
I don't,
I don't want to say I,

78
00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.820
I realized there's no other way to say this other than how it's going to sound,

79
00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.990
but like the self worth meter is off the charts for way too many people.

80
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.950
It is,
but it's also a fake meter.

81
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.610
Like people are like holding up a meter of what they're pretending they're self

82
00:04:40.611 --> 00:04:44.500
worth is.
But in reality,
what they really think about themselves,

83
00:04:44.501 --> 00:04:46.180
they're incredibly insecure,

84
00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:51.120
which is why they're here trying to validate themselves in the first place.
This,

85
00:04:51.121 --> 00:04:55.000
this is a weird town in that everybody who comes here wants to be someone

86
00:04:55.001 --> 00:04:58.420
special and usually they want to be someone special because they weren't special

87
00:04:58.421 --> 00:05:01.750
when they were children.
So they get here,
you seek out this,

88
00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.580
this ultimate thing,

89
00:05:03.581 --> 00:05:08.500
which is fame and now because of people like Kim Kardashians and reality shows,

90
00:05:08.501 --> 00:05:10.130
you don't even have to do anything for it.
Anything.

91
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.530
You don't have to have a special talent.

92
00:05:11.531 --> 00:05:16.531
Troubling thing to me it you know what to put in work any more manifested itself

93
00:05:16.871 --> 00:05:19.450
with this like Kanye deck thing.
It's like Beck.

94
00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.940
I mean you can't really ask for more gifted musician or songwriters for,

95
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.730
it's like artistry is concerned.

96
00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.340
You could see what you can be subjective about it.
You could say you like him,

97
00:05:27.341 --> 00:05:29.740
you don't like him,
but the guys in artists,
I mean legitimate.

98
00:05:29.741 --> 00:05:32.980
He puts in the work he played.
He writes everything.
He plays every,

99
00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.530
every frag and instrument on his,
on his album.

100
00:05:35.531 --> 00:05:39.370
So it's like the guys putting in the work and why d value somebody who was

101
00:05:39.371 --> 00:05:43.870
actually an accomplished writer artist and say like,
well,

102
00:05:43.871 --> 00:05:48.871
his art isn't worth as much as somebody else's art or Kanye West has a real ego

103
00:05:49.061 --> 00:05:53.800
problem.
He needs psychedelics more than anyone I've ever seen.
The public,
I mean,

104
00:05:53.801 --> 00:05:58.340
he's such a insufferable Douche bag and that's because

105
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.480
<v 3>his ego is completely out of control.
He wants people to pay attention to him.</v>

106
00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:06.350
He wants to be loved.
He wants to be great.
He wants to be great.

107
00:06:06.351 --> 00:06:09.170
That's his big thing.
Leave me alone.
Let me be great.
You know,

108
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.910
you fucking rhyme shit surrounded,
but that's it.
No,

109
00:06:12.911 --> 00:06:16.490
no offense just to his handlers,
but like you're surrounded by awful people.

110
00:06:16.491 --> 00:06:16.700
Those,

111
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.640
the people are supposed to keep you in check and give me some perspective on

112
00:06:19.641 --> 00:06:22.910
your place in the universe,
which is only smaller than you can't do that.

113
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.130
They don't,
that's not their job.
Their job is to make money.

114
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:28.250
And the way they make money is to keep like rubbing his back and pushing them

115
00:06:28.251 --> 00:06:30.530
out there in the ring.
I mean that,
that's it.
Keep,

116
00:06:30.531 --> 00:06:32.810
keep getting them to make more money.
Jewish people.

117
00:06:32.811 --> 00:06:37.550
We have our families to both like blow up our heads and also put us right back

118
00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:41.180
in our place.
I remember I got into some trouble a couple of years ago.

119
00:06:41.181 --> 00:06:42.530
I was on a jury.

120
00:06:42.531 --> 00:06:46.280
I was the jury foreman in a criminal case in Miami Dade Circuit Court.
And,
uh,

121
00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:51.310
it was an armed robbery case and I tweet it because that's what I do.

122
00:06:51.351 --> 00:06:52.250
I didn't tweet about the case,

123
00:06:52.251 --> 00:06:55.250
but I did my usual shit of just kind of observations of the courthouse.

124
00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.280
I noticed that it was a,
it was named for this guy,
Richard Gerstein,

125
00:06:58.281 --> 00:07:00.450
who was a state attorney who had,
uh,

126
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:05.350
had rumored ties to Meyer Lansky later represented peewee Herman in his,
uh,

127
00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:08.430
indecent exposure case in Florida,
you know,
when he was in the,
you know,

128
00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:12.160
jerking off in the adult theater.
And,
um,
just thinking about,

129
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:16.310
I could see from the window in the jury pool room,
I was like,
how,
you know,

130
00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:17.510
how appropriate that,

131
00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.480
that the view from the jury room and the in the criminal courthouse is one of

132
00:07:20.481 --> 00:07:22.940
the greatest crimes perpetuated on the people of Miami Dade,

133
00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:26.360
which was the Marlins Park,
the publicly financed,
you know,
sports welfare,

134
00:07:26.361 --> 00:07:29.990
Boondoggle of,
of Miami,
Marlins Stadium,
Baseball Park.

135
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:34.040
And so ignorant to that,
we'll get back to that.

136
00:07:34.041 --> 00:07:36.950
But I like just tweeting stupid observational shit.

137
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:39.080
And then my usual sort of aggregating articles.

138
00:07:39.081 --> 00:07:42.230
So this comes up on appeal that public defender,

139
00:07:42.231 --> 00:07:45.470
we can victim of a lesser included offense.
The public defender says,
oh,

140
00:07:45.471 --> 00:07:48.110
the jury foreman was tweeting,
like live tweeting the trial,

141
00:07:48.111 --> 00:07:50.510
which is not what happened.
I didn't delete anything.

142
00:07:50.511 --> 00:07:54.590
All my tweets are still there.
So the Miami Herald like rips me,

143
00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:59.150
they have this completely talent free,
a writer at the Herald.

144
00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:01.580
She actually slept her way to the middle is what she did.

145
00:08:01.581 --> 00:08:04.740
She slept with her married editor and got a promotion and it was a whole
scandal.

146
00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:06.110
Really?
Yeah.
And,
and the,

147
00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:10.400
and now I call her America and Cuba's worst columnist and she still has a job.

148
00:08:10.401 --> 00:08:13.580
It's,
it's unbelievable.
And she like rips me for being a,

149
00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:15.740
what was it like tweeting Twitter?
That's what she called me,

150
00:08:15.741 --> 00:08:20.660
a tweeting twit and my,
my,
my parrot won't shit on the Herald.
You know what?

151
00:08:20.661 --> 00:08:25.090
I line its cage with it.
So like the Herald's masthead is like Miami Herald,
uh,

152
00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:28.880
yesterday's news,
tomorrow corrections to follow.
That's their shtick.

153
00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:33.410
So like Mike,
but my grandpa old school,
they still read the newspaper,
you know,

154
00:08:33.411 --> 00:08:37.850
he likes the ink on his fingers.
And so he reads this like vicious column about,

155
00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:42.380
about me,
about his grandson.
And his takeaway is this,
he's like,

156
00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:45.170
this is a few years ago.
So he says,
he says to me,
he goes,

157
00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:50.390
how many Twitter followers do you have?
And I was like,

158
00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:53.270
a bat at the time was like maybe 10,
maybe 10,000.
I was like,

159
00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:55.530
I don't know about 10,000.
He goes,

160
00:08:56.110 --> 00:09:00.490
<v 2>just in Bieber is 22 million.
And that was it.
I just felt like shit.</v>

161
00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:01.830
Like he put me right back.

162
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:06.580
I was reminded of my place in the universe with one with that,
which I said,

163
00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.780
first of all,
how the hell does my grandfather,

164
00:09:08.781 --> 00:09:10.280
and I didn't even know that it goes pretty irrelevant,

165
00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:13.800
but grandfather sounds like a dick.
I'm going to be honest with you.

166
00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:19.230
He's a GRANDPA.
He's a wonderful man.
He's a wonderful,
wonderful man.

167
00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:23.710
He is.
That's all he had to say.
Just no neighborhoods.

168
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:25.200
He didn't say to me like,

169
00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:29.100
I'm ashamed of you and what you did and this woman destroying you in the

170
00:09:29.101 --> 00:09:32.010
newspaper.
He was like,
he was pretty cool with that.
He was just,

171
00:09:32.011 --> 00:09:34.470
he was just trying to understand this Twitter thing a little bit better.

172
00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:38.640
That's all.
He's still not on it though.
That's funny though.
Well,
yeah,

173
00:09:38.641 --> 00:09:42.150
I mean that having someone in your life to keep you in check like that is

174
00:09:42.151 --> 00:09:44.460
important.
Or having something,
you know,

175
00:09:44.461 --> 00:09:47.640
I don't think he has anything to keep them in check,

176
00:09:47.641 --> 00:09:51.210
which is why he thinks it's funny to go on stage and interrupt people's

177
00:09:51.211 --> 00:09:55.740
performances or,
or acceptance speeches.
No mother voting.

178
00:09:55.741 --> 00:09:59.130
Why don't they just like Kanye pick who wins everything.
That was.
How about this?

179
00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:02.520
How about the Emmys are stupid.
How about the Oscars are stupid.

180
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:05.400
They're all stupid or award shows for art or dumb.

181
00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:08.940
They really are because art is incredibly subjective.

182
00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:12.000
You know this and this idea that you're going to have this one big moment where

183
00:10:12.001 --> 00:10:15.240
everybody dresses up like a penguin and you all get together and pretend that

184
00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:19.320
this is our night to shine,
shine for.
It's got to make a living too.
Dude,

185
00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:22.020
who's top,
he just liked the Tux is like Justin Timberlake.

186
00:10:22.021 --> 00:10:25.290
He does tuxes is kind of like his shtick.
He's a fashion designer,

187
00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:30.030
but like I,
I'm not a big,
everybody always,

188
00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:33.220
I often get introduced or like people like a write up a bio or blurb on me,

189
00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:34.860
they'll be like award winning filmmaker.
I'm like,

190
00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:39.660
I don't actually think I've won any awards awards.
I guess we have along the way.

191
00:10:39.661 --> 00:10:42.600
Like I got it.
I got a key to the city of Miami and Miami Beach,

192
00:10:42.601 --> 00:10:45.990
which was incredibly disappointing because when you know you're in Miami beach

193
00:10:45.991 --> 00:10:47.820
and somebody gives you a key,
right?

194
00:10:47.821 --> 00:10:50.040
You're kind of hoping it's going to be something else if you,

195
00:10:50.041 --> 00:10:52.170
if you hear what I'm screaming,
but uh,
the,

196
00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:57.080
it was not the kind of key that you hope to get when you go to Miami.
He low.
Yes.

197
00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:59.650
It's one of your,
when you explain it.
I think so.

198
00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.410
Well it didn't work unless you did that.

199
00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:07.600
I think there's a few listeners that got it.
Maybe two that are
keys.

200
00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:12.060
Mine.
There's only,
there's only,
there's only two listeners coked up right now.

201
00:11:12.061 --> 00:11:13.680
I don't think that's true.
There's more than two,

202
00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:15.770
but they're the only ones that got that show.

203
00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:22.020
What we were talking about before about what's wrong with this town,

204
00:11:22.021 --> 00:11:24.630
and this is probably the last time we should get into it because this is like

205
00:11:24.631 --> 00:11:27.820
such a tired subject,
but the,

206
00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:32.010
the idea that people who didn't get enough attention when they were young,

207
00:11:32.011 --> 00:11:34.740
so they developed this hole in their soul.

208
00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:36.420
They need to fill up at other people's attention.

209
00:11:36.421 --> 00:11:40.590
They come here and then they seek validation through auditioning,

210
00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:42.990
which is one of the most ridiculous processes ever.

211
00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:46.110
I mean the idea that you're going to be in line with a bunch of other people

212
00:11:46.111 --> 00:11:50.640
hoping to get picked and if you do get picked like yes,
yes,
it's me.

213
00:11:50.641 --> 00:11:53.560
I'm going to be the one and then you're the one who's going to get there and

214
00:11:53.561 --> 00:11:56.380
then the camera's on you and they put makeup on you to make it pretty and

215
00:11:56.710 --> 00:12:00.760
perfect lighting and it's all these,
it's this weird thing.

216
00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:01.930
Then if you're lucky,

217
00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:05.080
you can get through that with some sense of what you're trying to do in the

218
00:12:05.081 --> 00:12:05.591
first place,

219
00:12:05.591 --> 00:12:08.770
which is like trying to create something cool that people enjoy and then some

220
00:12:08.771 --> 00:12:12.910
sense of humility where you kind of understand that that's in the greater

221
00:12:12.911 --> 00:12:15.670
spectrum of the universe.
It's really not that significant.

222
00:12:15.671 --> 00:12:20.671
What it is is it gets a lot of attention because we're confused and media

223
00:12:21.581 --> 00:12:24.100
confuses people and the idea of the one,

224
00:12:24.101 --> 00:12:28.030
the Alpha with the light on them and the one who has the microphone and the one

225
00:12:28.031 --> 00:12:32.290
who has the voice and that this is somehow or another makes you special,

226
00:12:32.291 --> 00:12:33.790
but it doesn't.
It's just entertainment.

227
00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:37.670
<v 3>Well does she thinks I had to say about the first of which is that I'm going to</v>

228
00:12:37.671 --> 00:12:39.020
put it out there.
I don't talk about it that much,

229
00:12:39.021 --> 00:12:42.110
but I'm gonna put it out there because I think step one in the program is

230
00:12:42.111 --> 00:12:45.740
admitting that you have a problem.
So I was a child actor.
Oh,
not in this,

231
00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:49.010
in this town and this town.
And that's your problem.
I wished that there was,
yeah,

232
00:12:49.011 --> 00:12:51.230
but it was very good to me.
It was very good to me.

233
00:12:51.231 --> 00:12:55.430
I was very successful and end before I retired at 15 or whenever or whatever it

234
00:12:55.431 --> 00:12:57.080
was.
But like,
it,
uh,

235
00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:01.220
first of all I wished there was a different term other than child actor,
which g,

236
00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:05.300
which immediately evokes images of like liquor store robberies,

237
00:13:05.301 --> 00:13:09.220
drug overdoses and child molestation.
But like,
but that's what I was,
um,

238
00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:11.740
the second thing I want it,
I want to say,

239
00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:14.570
which I probably shouldn't talk about because you mentioned it when you're

240
00:13:14.571 --> 00:13:17.330
talking about the casting process and,
um,

241
00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:20.210
and how completely toxic that is,
uh,

242
00:13:20.211 --> 00:13:24.200
in terms of creating anything of substance.
And it's not just,

243
00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:26.420
it's this development process.
We,
we,

244
00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:32.200
we optioned the rights to develop a dramatic series about cocaine cowboys about

245
00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:37.010
I think eight years ago now with Bruckheimer television,

246
00:13:37.011 --> 00:13:39.710
Michael Bay and one or horizons.

247
00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:43.880
And we had been developing the show,

248
00:13:43.881 --> 00:13:46.490
developing development,
developing,
you know,

249
00:13:46.491 --> 00:13:50.090
when you say a word so much or you look at it so often it loses its meaning and

250
00:13:50.091 --> 00:13:53.480
you kind of have to look like what does this word means?
Something development.

251
00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:56.480
So we're on a call one down there.
This is already years ago,

252
00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:59.450
it was years into development and years ago already.

253
00:13:59.451 --> 00:14:04.340
That's how long we've been developing this.
And I'm looking at,

254
00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:06.290
we're on a conference call,
you can't get a word in edge wise,

255
00:14:06.291 --> 00:14:07.190
really on a conference call.

256
00:14:07.191 --> 00:14:10.050
So I'm listening to this call and I'm looking at at the,

257
00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:15.190
at the calendar and it says JB TV development call and I'm staring at the word

258
00:14:15.351 --> 00:14:18.980
and it loses its meaning.
So I kind of,
you know,
the,
the voices turned into,

259
00:14:18.981 --> 00:14:21.660
you know,
peanuts,
you know,
adults won't want Wah,
Wah,
Wah Wah.

260
00:14:21.661 --> 00:14:25.470
And I open a new tab in my browser and I go to dictionary.com I probably should

261
00:14:25.471 --> 00:14:28.430
have got an urban dictionary.com and I go to dictionary.com and I look up the

262
00:14:28.431 --> 00:14:33.431
word development and I realize looking at the definition that the development

263
00:14:33.711 --> 00:14:38.711
process in film and Television and there to entertainment is the antithesis of

264
00:14:38.871 --> 00:14:43.520
the definition of the word development,
which infers progress,
evolution.

265
00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:45.680
And it's the exact opposite of that.

266
00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:49.190
If it doesn't stifle progress it,

267
00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:52.640
it actually has a reverse.
It's like d evolution.

268
00:14:52.641 --> 00:14:56.870
It's like an development or d development.
I don't know what the term is,

269
00:14:56.871 --> 00:14:59.540
but it's a total misnomer.
A you this,

270
00:14:59.541 --> 00:15:02.900
this idea of developing cause like we want to make a documentary,

271
00:15:02.901 --> 00:15:06.590
we get an idea or someone comes to us and we have access to a cool person or a

272
00:15:06.591 --> 00:15:11.030
great story and we,
I got two partners.
It's me and two guys.

273
00:15:11.031 --> 00:15:14.780
One Guy I've known,
I've known so long,
our parents used to bathe us together.

274
00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:18.560
I mean we were sophomores in high school.
That was weird.
But like,
uh,
no,

275
00:15:18.561 --> 00:15:19.720
we were nursery school.
We were in,

276
00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:22.700
I know the guy literally since nursery school or other partner outfront
Spellman,

277
00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:24.920
I know him from television production in middle school.

278
00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:27.590
So we look at each other and go,
does this sound like a cool idea?
Yeah,

279
00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:30.680
let's do it.
That's our development in the nonfiction world.

280
00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:34.250
This whole like scripted thing where like you bring in three writers and you pay

281
00:15:34.251 --> 00:15:39.251
them untold amounts of money and they're from Santa Monica with Nannies and

282
00:15:39.261 --> 00:15:42.470
they're going to write for the Miami drug scene in the late seventies.

283
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:45.620
You're like,
what is going on here?
How is this progress?

284
00:15:45.621 --> 00:15:47.480
How are we developing anything here?

285
00:15:47.481 --> 00:15:52.481
And in terms of our warped values and media manipulating w w w our priorities,

286
00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:59.320
nothing breaks my heart more than when I tweet something important that's going

287
00:15:59.391 --> 00:16:03.230
on in the world and it gets like two retweets or whatever.

288
00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:08.300
And then you tweet something about Kim Kardashians or Justin Bieber or Kanye

289
00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:12.990
West or Bruce Jenner,
God forbid.
And it just,
it gets,
uh,

290
00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:18.040
it gets 1200 retweets or some crazy Florida man story that gets 10,000 retweets

291
00:16:18.111 --> 00:16:20.510
and,
and it breaks my heart because I'm just like,
I'm like,

292
00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:24.900
I'm contributing to the distraction.
Here is what I feel like and,
and,
but I,

293
00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:29.450
but I,
it really frustrates me.
It's like,
what's something about,
you know,
uh,
uh,

294
00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:33.500
uh,
the lack of accountability in politics or the public sector or,
you know,
the,

295
00:16:33.501 --> 00:16:33.951
the,
the,

296
00:16:33.951 --> 00:16:38.420
the dramatic increase in police and police brutality and the prison population

297
00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:41.420
as the,
the crime rate drops precipitously.

298
00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:44.030
All these things that we should kind of be concerned about as a people.

299
00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:47.410
And I just realized,
I was like,
maybe I need to take my own advice and like the,

300
00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:51.020
the fact that we're all so insignificant and so small and this time is so

301
00:16:51.021 --> 00:16:53.300
fleeting,
why not just have a good time while we're here?

302
00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:55.730
We're not actually gonna change anything for the better.
It's like that saying,

303
00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:56.690
what's it saying?
It's like,
ah,

304
00:16:56.870 --> 00:17:01.400
I want to have less corruption or more participation in it or something.
Like,

305
00:17:01.401 --> 00:17:04.930
it's like that's how as I get older I feel like,
well,
what were were,

306
00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:07.820
where am I getting here?
Why not,
you know,
I,
I'm not actually going to affect,

307
00:17:07.830 --> 00:17:10.820
shoot any positive change.
Maybe a little,

308
00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:13.550
maybe a little bit of awareness in my corner of the Twitter verse,

309
00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:17.100
but w w which don't,
I just need to do something for myself,

310
00:17:17.101 --> 00:17:19.510
for my family and I can't do that.
There's like something,

311
00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:24.590
there's a moral compass that just won't let me kind of like compromise my values

312
00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:28.460
and in a weird way,
I hate that about myself.
Just relax man.

313
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.530
Seriously do smoke weed.
No,
you should probably,
it would help you alone.

314
00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:37.820
That's the diagnosis.
Well,
you guys have medical marijuana here for,
for Biloxi.

315
00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:38.810
For Fuck's sake,
dude.

316
00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:43.820
I fought my ass off for amendment two in Florida.

317
00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:48.350
We got nearly 58% of the vote and it failed.

318
00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:50.220
[inaudible] 62 right?

319
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:55.080
<v 1>Scott,
the least popular governor in the history of anything,
anywhere.
Okay.</v>

320
00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:59.460
Gets 47% of the vote in four more years to destroy the state of Florida.

321
00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:04.530
Like,
but we have too many old people.
Too many old people.
It's demonstrating,

322
00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:05.161
yeah,
they,

323
00:18:05.161 --> 00:18:09.750
their idea of what marijuana is just completely fucked by propaganda or elected

324
00:18:09.751 --> 00:18:12.780
officials fortunately are kind of realizing that like,
wait a second,

325
00:18:12.781 --> 00:18:17.190
if you look at the,
the,
the,
the,
the district results for amendment to,

326
00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:19.530
they're going,
well,
shit,
my constituents want this.

327
00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:22.380
So now you do have some local politicians who are trying to,

328
00:18:22.381 --> 00:18:26.580
and state politicians who are trying to introduce bills now that will,
uh,

329
00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:28.980
that will bring medical marijuana to the state of Florida.

330
00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:33.330
Because what they're trying to do is beat 2016 where met,
not only is it a,

331
00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:35.460
you know,
is it a presidential elections of turnout?

332
00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:39.390
Turnout in Florida could be as much as,
I don't know,
12%.
Why don't people vote?

333
00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:43.230
Why don't people vote?
Well,
they feel discouraged.
They don't think it works.

334
00:18:43.231 --> 00:18:44.730
You look at the system itself.

335
00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:48.360
You look at special interest groups and lobbyists and the amount of money that

336
00:18:48.361 --> 00:18:51.870
corporations donate towards campaigns to mobilize,

337
00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:54.300
not just to impact how people are going to vote,

338
00:18:54.301 --> 00:18:57.360
but just to get people going out to vote.
If you,
one thing's for sure,

339
00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:01.590
if you don't vote,
your votes not going to be counted.
I can guarantee,

340
00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:03.670
I can guarantee that.
Right.

341
00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:08.940
So the special interest money really goes towards mobilizing people who are

342
00:19:09.631 --> 00:19:11.760
already in a way like minded,
like you said,

343
00:19:11.761 --> 00:19:15.510
like the elderly population and which is really what helped kill I think,

344
00:19:15.511 --> 00:19:19.530
recreational marijuana here or the expansion of marijuana laws in California.

345
00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:24.510
It was,
it was,
you weren't quite there yet.
People weren't,

346
00:19:24.511 --> 00:19:27.290
I think getting out,
not getting out the vote per se,
but,

347
00:19:27.291 --> 00:19:30.900
but they weren't convincing the elderly population who by the way probably need

348
00:19:30.901 --> 00:19:34.440
marijuana even more than I do.
Um,
just in terms of their,
you know,
their metal,

349
00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:35.310
their maladies,

350
00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:39.330
it probably would do more for them and certainly in Florida do more for them.

351
00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:42.710
But some of them are still on that,
you know,
that Hippie drug thing?
Yeah.

352
00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:45.060
That's what they think it is.
Yeah.
Which is,
which doesn't make any sense.

353
00:19:45.061 --> 00:19:50.061
Not to mention what could any governor or any politician or anybody in this

354
00:19:50.131 --> 00:19:54.720
country do and the single stroke of a pen that would create the kind of economy

355
00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:57.120
that that brings.
How do you create jobs?

356
00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:02.700
You know that many jobs and that kind of revenue in the marijuana,
marijuana,

357
00:20:02.701 --> 00:20:06.480
the marijuana and there's nothing else I could possibly think of that you could

358
00:20:06.481 --> 00:20:11.481
do where you can say like overnight we could just create an epic industry that

359
00:20:12.091 --> 00:20:17.091
not only hurts no one but helps millions of people and more importantly

360
00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:22.340
decriminalizes a class of people in this country that we have needlessly spent

361
00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:27.360
untold millions of dollars to deprive them of life,
liberty and property.

362
00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:29.190
And you're right,
I need to smoke.

363
00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:31.440
Like just give me like a fucking brown or some money.

364
00:20:31.441 --> 00:20:33.450
They're making Colorado so staggering.

365
00:20:33.451 --> 00:20:37.740
They have to give it back to the taxpayers and you read that the refunds,

366
00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:40.980
yet they're giving people money back.
Too much money for education.

367
00:20:40.981 --> 00:20:45.981
Now they are literally making untold millions of dollars in tax revenue that

368
00:20:47.261 --> 00:20:50.710
would be unavailable otherwise and most likely the same amount of people are

369
00:20:50.711 --> 00:20:51.544
smoking weed,

370
00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:55.360
which just lets you know that this is just really an inefficient use of,

371
00:20:55.361 --> 00:20:59.290
of public resources.
Does the inefficient use of a commodity,

372
00:20:59.291 --> 00:21:01.960
which is unnatural commodity.
That's a part of life.

373
00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:05.710
I mean marijuana is a God damn plant that's been used for thousands of years in

374
00:21:05.711 --> 00:21:09.610
Florida.
We had a pill mill crisis.
No.
Yeah,
the likes that we have.

375
00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:14.700
I mean I had that,
that did that documentary.
Um,
the uh,

376
00:21:14.701 --> 00:21:18.290
the oxycontin express.
Oh yeah.
Great.
Amazing.
Amazing.

377
00:21:18.291 --> 00:21:22.270
I think it was up to seven people a day were dying in the state of Florida.

378
00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:26.050
These are some,
we mean children.
It's not enough.
You should kill more.

379
00:21:26.290 --> 00:21:29.860
You guys should have opened up more coal plants in new spots in Florida.

380
00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:34.000
Too many people maybe in the north.
I prefer the,
you know they say in Florida,

381
00:21:34.001 --> 00:21:35.110
the further north you go,

382
00:21:35.111 --> 00:21:38.260
the further south you are and you forget that like Florida,

383
00:21:38.261 --> 00:21:40.690
I mean this was like Jim Crow,
south Florida.

384
00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:43.660
South Florida is like a tropical country.

385
00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:47.950
It's like the only way I can compare it to people who might get some percent.

386
00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:51.640
It's like Atlanta in Georgia.
Yes.
Kind of south Florida is like,

387
00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:53.010
cause we're still very much a red.

388
00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:57.000
We're like a red state with a blue for skin that everybody wishes they could

389
00:21:57.010 --> 00:21:59.360
just circumcise like right off the state.

390
00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:01.780
And in fact the city of South Miami is interesting thing about Miami Dade.

391
00:22:01.781 --> 00:22:04.030
Nobody even knows this.
Miami Dade County,

392
00:22:04.031 --> 00:22:08.290
which has about I think 2.6 million people now we're made up of like 34

393
00:22:08.291 --> 00:22:09.340
different municipalities.

394
00:22:09.341 --> 00:22:12.910
So there's a total of like 35 different mayors in just Miami Dade County.

395
00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:18.380
And the city of Miami is just one small city among the 34 in Miami Dade County.

396
00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:19.331
And in fact,

397
00:22:19.331 --> 00:22:23.710
Dade County get this used to be called Dade County or Metro Dade County in 97 we

398
00:22:23.711 --> 00:22:26.830
rebranded,
we voted to change the name of the,
of the town.

399
00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:29.470
Like where else other than like Bombay and Mumbai,

400
00:22:29.471 --> 00:22:32.290
like you think of a place that like changes the name.

401
00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:37.240
We rebranded it to Miami Dade County to borrow essentially the most famous brand

402
00:22:37.241 --> 00:22:40.060
that we have,
which is the most famous city in,
in the area.

403
00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:43.440
And so one of these cities,
these 34 municipalities,
we have 34,

404
00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:47.770
34 municipalities and I think to be fair only there's still 30 of them who

405
00:22:47.771 --> 00:22:50.170
haven't had their mayor arrested yet in the last two years.
So that's a,

406
00:22:50.171 --> 00:22:53.530
that's a pretty good ratio.
But the city of south Miami actually,

407
00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:57.520
they had like a resolution to uh,

408
00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:00.100
essentially succeed,
not secede from the union,

409
00:23:00.101 --> 00:23:05.101
but split Florida down the middle into two separate states in north Florida or

410
00:23:06.131 --> 00:23:09.590
north and south,
uh,
south Florida to this day.
Great,

411
00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:12.850
great idea.
For Real.
It's a great,

412
00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:18.040
it'll never happen because south Florida's revenue is what finances Tallahassee,

413
00:23:18.701 --> 00:23:21.760
which is the state capital,
which is an in the panhandle in northern Florida.

414
00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:23.170
So that'll never happen because they,
they,

415
00:23:23.171 --> 00:23:27.730
they live off the fat of our land and our tourism trade.
So that'll never happen.

416
00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:30.490
But it's a great idea.
When you look at the politics,

417
00:23:30.491 --> 00:23:34.510
when you look at the demographics and,
and,
and,
and how,

418
00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:38.470
sort of the way that people,
the thought process,
we are very much two different,

419
00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:43.160
two different states.
South Florida is more democratic.
It's more liberal,

420
00:23:43.161 --> 00:23:46.220
the blue tip.
But there's a lot of Cubans that are very Republican,

421
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:51.040
<v 3>right?
A lot of conservative ever since Kennedy and the Bay of Pigs,
they,
they,</v>

422
00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:54.020
they took a hard,
a hard,
right.
I mean,
there,
there,

423
00:23:54.021 --> 00:23:57.410
there are Cubans who have not voted Democrat since Kennedy,

424
00:23:58.250 --> 00:23:59.960
but you're seeing now a new generation,

425
00:23:59.961 --> 00:24:04.910
third and fourth generation Cubans who are now being actually born in Miami.
Uh,

426
00:24:04.911 --> 00:24:07.640
you see this trend changing.
Miami used to go to Miami and,
and just say,

427
00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:09.890
really anywhere in Florida,
where are you from?

428
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:13.880
And even if people were there for 60 years,
they'd go Cuba,
Chicago,
Philadelphia,

429
00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:17.240
New York,
know no one was from Miami.
That's changing now.

430
00:24:17.241 --> 00:24:20.420
You see a little bit of this three Oh five til I die.
This kind of like,
you know,

431
00:24:20.421 --> 00:24:24.830
the spirit of like,
uh,
the spirit of like ownership of belonging,

432
00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:27.770
which I keep hoping it's going to manifest itself in people driving better and

433
00:24:27.771 --> 00:24:29.630
using their turn signals and being nicer to each other.

434
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:33.260
I keep trying to say it's not Miami or your Emmy,
it's our Emmy.

435
00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:36.680
This is a collective experience here.
People,
let's say we're in this together,

436
00:24:36.681 --> 00:24:41.120
let's just be nicer,
nicer to each other.
But like you're a Miami fan boy.

437
00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:45.810
I am.
I am.
I'm a homeboy and I get homesick when I traveled to like,
I'm like,
I,

438
00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:49.280
I miss it.
Especially when I go Ellie's different cause it's not homogenized.

439
00:24:49.281 --> 00:24:52.190
But when I travel around to places where it like I'm like,
I'm nervous.

440
00:24:52.191 --> 00:24:53.840
There's too many white people here.
Like,

441
00:24:53.841 --> 00:24:57.820
I need some Odos Campolo and in some Catholic or Lecce like I get nervous when,

442
00:24:57.821 --> 00:25:01.430
when there's not,
you know,
when there's like a homogenized population,

443
00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:04.910
I don't like to mix it up.
I don't know Miami because Miami,
like you just,

444
00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:05.601
you're driving,

445
00:25:05.601 --> 00:25:10.310
you can drive a stretch of blocks in Miami beach and you go from the Argentinian

446
00:25:10.311 --> 00:25:12.470
neighborhood to the Venezuela neighborhood of the Brazilian neighborhood.

447
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:15.710
I should say this,
there's a common misconception that Miami is a melting pot.

448
00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:17.150
We are not a melting pot.

449
00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:21.200
We are more akin to like a TV dinner where sometimes the piece fall over into

450
00:25:21.201 --> 00:25:23.420
the mashed potatoes because we self segregate.

451
00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:27.350
We do that anywhere we go is people,
you know,
we find likeminded or Chinatown,

452
00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:31.190
similar looking people and we,
and we stick to our own.
So in Miami,
you know,

453
00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:35.060
you have the Jewish neighborhood,
you have a,
uh,
you know,
a Haitian neighborhood.

454
00:25:35.061 --> 00:25:36.740
You have an African American neighborhood and go,

455
00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:38.770
you have a Cuban neighborhood of Cuban neighborhood of Cuban neighborhood of

456
00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:41.810
Cuban neighborhood.
You have.
Um,
then like I was saying in Miami Beach,

457
00:25:41.811 --> 00:25:46.310
even you have than a Swayla Brazil,
Brazilian neighborhood,
they don't,
you know,

458
00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:49.850
even the South Americans,
which is the thing they hate the most,

459
00:25:49.851 --> 00:25:51.410
is like being called Latin Hispanic.

460
00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:53.930
They're very prideful and nationalistic people.

461
00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:56.570
They want to be associated with their nation,
their actual,

462
00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:59.120
you're getting into an argument and anybody in Miami on until you see what flag

463
00:25:59.121 --> 00:26:02.330
is hanging from the rear view mirror because God forbid,
dude,

464
00:26:02.331 --> 00:26:06.500
you should call an Argentinian Venezuelan,
a Venezuelan,
a Cuban,

465
00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:10.760
a Cuban,
uh,
a Brazilian they get,
or any of them are Mexican,

466
00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:14.340
they all hate Mexicans for or for some reason.
And then,

467
00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:19.010
I don't know.
But they,
and all of them,
if you ask any of them,
they'll tell you,

468
00:26:19.011 --> 00:26:22.430
oh my great bro.
Like,
like for truth,
Bro,
like seriously.
Like my great,

469
00:26:22.431 --> 00:26:26.240
great grandfather is from Spain.
They all claim they're European.

470
00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:29.060
Then none of them are Caribbean.
They're all European.
It's,
it's kind of fun.

471
00:26:29.061 --> 00:26:33.200
And I like that.
That kind of in Cindy Arie mix of people,
you know,

472
00:26:33.201 --> 00:26:36.530
and like 1980 it was like,
which is kind of the inspiration cooking cowboys.

473
00:26:36.530 --> 00:26:41.210
It was like that year we're like all of the chemicals just mixed together and

474
00:26:41.211 --> 00:26:43.770
shit just exploded.
And that's your,

475
00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:47.940
there's that tension in Miami constantly that that I think is just,

476
00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:50.760
it just makes it an exciting,
exciting place.

477
00:26:50.761 --> 00:26:54.360
Particularly when anybody outside of Miami and they think there's only like one

478
00:26:54.361 --> 00:26:57.390
hotel,
the colony on ocean drive because wherever you are in Miami,
all,
you know,

479
00:26:57.391 --> 00:27:00.450
is it like 15 blocks of ocean drive,
you know?
And,

480
00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:04.530
and even when you watch Miami dolphins games or like the orange bowl game,

481
00:27:04.531 --> 00:27:07.800
which is at Joe Robbie Stadium are now sunlife stadium in Miami Gardens,

482
00:27:07.801 --> 00:27:11.220
one of the most dangerous municipalities in my immediate one most dangerous

483
00:27:11.221 --> 00:27:13.740
neighborhoods in the world is Miami Gardens.
That's where the stadium is located.

484
00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:16.830
They'll crossfade from the game to the blimp,

485
00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:21.120
aerial of the stadium and then we'll cross fade to ocean drive as if that's

486
00:27:21.121 --> 00:27:25.350
right outside.
It's 18 miles away from the stadium.
And,

487
00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:30.210
but that's what people associate with Miami.
Most of Miami is third world.

488
00:27:30.211 --> 00:27:32.640
Ian,
I mean,
Miami Dade County has one,

489
00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:37.670
I think only the second greatest disparity in income gap in the key of any major

490
00:27:37.951 --> 00:27:42.300
county in the country.
We are,
you know what,
what did the,
uh,
TD Allman had a book,

491
00:27:42.410 --> 00:27:46.230
uh,
called,
um,
city of the future about Miami that,
you know,
they say that dot.

492
00:27:46.231 --> 00:27:48.660
Like,
the Florida of today is the America of tomorrow.

493
00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:51.660
And if you want to know what shit is gonna go down in America,

494
00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:56.460
what calamities are going to befall this country in like the next 20 years or
so?

495
00:27:56.730 --> 00:27:58.920
You look at what's going on in Miami or Florida,

496
00:27:58.921 --> 00:28:02.730
that is the barometer of whether it's the drug trade,
immigration,

497
00:28:02.731 --> 00:28:04.770
what we're dealing with,
with,
with now,
with the,
you know,
the,

498
00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:07.650
the Browning of America,
if you will,
they span a sizing of America.

499
00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:12.600
And the pushback we've been through all of that shit.
Medicare fraud,
uh,

500
00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:17.200
you name it,
we have experienced it already in,
in Miami,
or are in flow,

501
00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:21.390
the Greater Florida area.
And,
and we know what's coming basically.

502
00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:25.560
<v 1>Sure.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.</v>

503
00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:28.060
We got everything but earthquakes in mud slides.

504
00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:31.590
How did you get involved with this documentary?
Cocaine cowboys.
What was the,

505
00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:33.390
what was the inspiration to make this?

506
00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:37.800
Just knowing the history of how crazy Miami was and what,

507
00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:42.860
what led to this massive surge of drugs into that part of the country?

508
00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:47.230
What was her childhood in a weird way?
I mean,
we grew up in Miami.

509
00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:50.820
I was born in a place called Fort Myers,
Florida on the,
uh,
on the west coast.

510
00:28:50.821 --> 00:28:53.980
So you lived out here when you do a couple of years,
you know,
for,

511
00:28:53.981 --> 00:28:56.460
for like five pilot seasons or whatever the hell you do.

512
00:28:56.780 --> 00:29:01.290
Did your parents bring you out here to do them?
I,
yeah,
I asked them to.
Whoa.
Yeah.

513
00:29:01.291 --> 00:29:04.830
I asked him to.
Wow.
So it wasn't even that you had stage parents?
It was all yo,

514
00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:09.840
dude,
every year my parents would say to me enough,
whenever you're done.
Yeah.

515
00:29:09.841 --> 00:29:12.600
They would say,
whenever you're done.
That's just like that.

516
00:29:12.601 --> 00:29:16.410
That's dead ringer for oddly from my dad.
Uh,
he's transitioning now.

517
00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:21.330
That was weird
transitioning you.
She can say that a few years ago,

518
00:29:21.331 --> 00:29:23.020
no one would know what the fuck you're talking about,

519
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:25.280
but you say he's transitioning now.
It's like,

520
00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:29.430
is here this like overwhelming influx of transgender people in our culture?

521
00:29:29.431 --> 00:29:33.750
Is I what's going on?
Or,
or we're just more aware of it I guess.
And you are,

522
00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:37.900
and it's kind of okay.
I mean,
like gay people got married in Alabama this week.

523
00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:42.040
It's a new world man.
Like it's Internet.
It's,
it's,
it's,
it's kind

524
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:46.300
<v 3>of fantastic.
Like I'm like when I was traveling,
we were on set of this pilot,
uh,</v>

525
00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:50.850
in,
in,
in Puerto Rico.
And while I was on the plane,
there was no internet on,
on,

526
00:29:50.851 --> 00:29:53.080
on this slide because we're coming from Puerto Rico for whatever reason.

527
00:29:53.081 --> 00:29:55.210
And so as soon as I landed a,

528
00:29:55.211 --> 00:29:59.830
Obama had announced the new Cuba policy and I landed in Miami while this was

529
00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:04.690
going on in the air.
And,
um,
no one really knew exactly how Miami was gonna react.

530
00:30:04.691 --> 00:30:08.230
The truth is,
a lot of the hard line,
older conservative Cubans have died off.

531
00:30:08.231 --> 00:30:09.310
The demographic is changing.

532
00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:14.350
There are Cuban kids growing up now who don't want to never get to see Cuba

533
00:30:14.351 --> 00:30:16.870
before they die.
Like a lot of their grandparents never got to end.

534
00:30:16.871 --> 00:30:17.980
Great grandparents ever got to go back.

535
00:30:17.981 --> 00:30:22.000
So the sentiment was very different from whatever like from circa Ellian

536
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.940
Gonzales that was like the last gasp of you know,
eggs,

537
00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:29.770
right wing exile a a politics was really the Elian Gonzales a fiasco.

538
00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:30.880
And so this,

539
00:30:30.970 --> 00:30:34.300
this was a little bit calmer but like I landed and I was like I just landed in a

540
00:30:34.301 --> 00:30:35.380
whole new world.

541
00:30:35.381 --> 00:30:38.770
Like it was an incredible and and whether you agree with policies or not,

542
00:30:38.771 --> 00:30:41.770
it's kind of cool to see when you're hyper aware of that,

543
00:30:41.771 --> 00:30:44.800
like history is happening in your lifetime and before your eyes.

544
00:30:44.801 --> 00:30:48.820
And that's what Miami was like in the 1980s and growing up we were even aware of

545
00:30:48.821 --> 00:30:53.620
it when I was most aware of it as a kid was the money we worked at.

546
00:30:53.621 --> 00:30:53.831
We were,

547
00:30:53.831 --> 00:30:58.390
we lived in this like working class Jewish neighborhood in north Miami beach and

548
00:30:58.391 --> 00:31:01.900
everybody was doing good.
They weren't in the drug business per se,

549
00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:06.520
but this is the best is the most successful case study in history for Ronald

550
00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:10.660
Reagan's trickle down economics theory because there was so much cash in Miami

551
00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:15.310
and it trickled down to everyone.
Whatever business you were in,

552
00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:17.050
you were making more cash,

553
00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:18.990
you were willing to the drug trade because of the drug trade.

554
00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.770
There was so much cash tourism.
By 1980 tourism was art and real estate.

555
00:31:23.771 --> 00:31:24.710
They were like our top businesses.

556
00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:29.740
Tourism was bringing in about five point $2 billion a year in Miami drugs.

557
00:31:30.370 --> 00:31:33.190
They're estimating was generating $7 billion a year,

558
00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:36.090
so it was an even bigger business than tourism in,
in,

559
00:31:36.091 --> 00:31:39.790
in that in the early 1980 so you just had,
it was just everywhere.

560
00:31:39.791 --> 00:31:43.270
Like in our neighborhood,
people added like made additions to their houses.

561
00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:46.300
They had like a Porsche or a nicer car and these are people who were,

562
00:31:46.450 --> 00:31:50.470
jewelers are in the grocery business or car dealers are just working people.

563
00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:52.630
But suddenly everybody was a little,

564
00:31:52.631 --> 00:31:55.060
was a little flush and they weren't upgrading in a major way.

565
00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:58.150
They were just getting themselves some toys that they could get with the fruits

566
00:31:58.151 --> 00:32:00.790
of,
of this new found a of this,

567
00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:05.620
the fruits of their labor in this new found a revenue generating cash and was

568
00:32:05.621 --> 00:32:09.010
just,
and you've heard the stats about,
you know,
from the movie about,
you know,

569
00:32:09.011 --> 00:32:11.390
the,
the,
uh,
the branch of the Federal Reserve in,

570
00:32:11.391 --> 00:32:16.391
in Miami had a cash surplus of more money than all the branches combined in the

571
00:32:16.751 --> 00:32:19.900
country.
That was just more cash.
Am I mean,
nobody had any place to put it.

572
00:32:19.901 --> 00:32:24.100
What you saw in Scarface when banks were charging a vague to deposit cash,

573
00:32:24.490 --> 00:32:28.120
that was true.
They had no place to put cash.
There was just too much cash.

574
00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:32.410
And it's true that if you took a $20 bill or done a denomination of 20 or above

575
00:32:32.411 --> 00:32:34.420
cash in Miami and tested it,

576
00:32:34.421 --> 00:32:38.500
there were traces of cocaine on almost every single bill in Miami.
It was so,

577
00:32:38.501 --> 00:32:42.260
it was literally trug money.
That's amazing.

578
00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:47.090
It's an amazing time.
And your documentary really captures it so brilliantly.

579
00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:48.770
It just with the,
when,

580
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:53.600
when you highlighted that that one graduating class of the police academy,

581
00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:59.200
that every single guy either went to jail or was murdered every single one.

582
00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:00.771
I mean that,

583
00:33:00.771 --> 00:33:05.771
that's an amazing moment in human history where you just get to see essentially

584
00:33:06.771 --> 00:33:10.970
it's a version of what's going on in Mexico right now.
Oh,
absolutely.
And,
and,

585
00:33:10.971 --> 00:33:13.010
and it's actually a version interestingly,

586
00:33:13.011 --> 00:33:18.011
of what's going on in the United States in terms of hiring practices and better

587
00:33:18.321 --> 00:33:21.800
screening people in law enforcement and people in the public sector in general.

588
00:33:21.890 --> 00:33:26.890
Because what happened there is that you didn't have good people who became cops

589
00:33:27.621 --> 00:33:31.040
and then the power went to their head and they became corrupt or anything like

590
00:33:31.041 --> 00:33:36.020
that.
You had,
you had gangsters,
straight up thugs who decided,

591
00:33:36.021 --> 00:33:36.650
well,

592
00:33:36.650 --> 00:33:41.270
where better to apply my trade then be hiding behind a badge.

593
00:33:41.390 --> 00:33:43.820
That's what happens with these weren't like,
this is why these were,

594
00:33:43.850 --> 00:33:46.790
these were bad guys who,
who it became.
We had a,
um,

595
00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:49.700
what happened was there was a federal judge,
there was a consent decree,

596
00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:52.550
a federal judge who was a civil rights action.

597
00:33:52.551 --> 00:33:55.100
A federal judge looked at the demographics,

598
00:33:55.101 --> 00:34:00.101
the changing demographics of Miami and said there's basically 100% of the Miami

599
00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:05.410
police department was white and they said you need a police force that better

600
00:34:05.691 --> 00:34:08.030
represents the community that they're policing.

601
00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:13.080
And so it was a federal judge who just waived,
waived his,
his,

602
00:34:13.090 --> 00:34:17.300
his magic pen and said,
hire more black officers,

603
00:34:17.301 --> 00:34:20.290
higher far,
far more of Hispanic officers.

604
00:34:20.291 --> 00:34:24.560
So you have a police to force that that reflects the community,

605
00:34:24.561 --> 00:34:27.770
their there and what happened,
I hate to say it,
but it's true.

606
00:34:27.771 --> 00:34:32.771
They kept reducing the standards for hiring and that's what happened is that

607
00:34:34.311 --> 00:34:38.330
they wound up with guys who were like,
wait,
I'm on the streets,

608
00:34:38.690 --> 00:34:43.550
I'm a straight up gangster,
but the Miami police are hiring.

609
00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:44.900
Like that's what happened.

610
00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:49.690
So really the system worked in a way and that they read it out,
you know,
the,
the,

611
00:34:49.691 --> 00:34:52.010
the worst of them.
And that's,
I think it's a little bit,

612
00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:55.480
I thinking by and large you have a lot of good cops now.
But the problem is,

613
00:34:55.481 --> 00:34:56.780
is that they're not screening,

614
00:34:56.810 --> 00:35:01.040
they're not sufficiently screening in the hiring process to say cereal.
Oh,

615
00:35:01.041 --> 00:35:02.090
I think so.
All over the country.

616
00:35:02.091 --> 00:35:04.070
I think you've got guys who are sort of naturally aggressive.

617
00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:07.460
You have a steroid epidemic in the police departments that are,

618
00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:10.900
that the unions have,
have completely precluded,
uh,

619
00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:15.620
municipalities from being able to test officers.
Um,
I think you have,
again,

620
00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:20.120
an epidemic that affects a certain minority or percentage of officers and

621
00:35:20.121 --> 00:35:24.000
departments,
but it's still an issue that you don't want guys like that with,

622
00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:27.770
you know,
with the ability to,
to deprive people of life,
liberty and property.

623
00:35:27.830 --> 00:35:29.990
Yeah.
The steroid thing is absolutely legit.

624
00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:32.750
I got pulled over by a dude who looked like Ronnie Coleman,

625
00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:36.080
who by the way was a police officer,
Ronnie Coleman,

626
00:35:36.110 --> 00:35:38.220
who was Mr was a police

627
00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:41.580
<v 2>officer.
I mean,
he might,
I don't know that,
I don't know if he still is,
but yeah,</v>

628
00:35:41.581 --> 00:35:45.540
I mean,
he was a long time police officer,
but this guy that pulled me over was,

629
00:35:45.541 --> 00:35:50.220
it was ridiculous.
And,
uh,
we,
we had a nice little chat,
you know,
he's a nice guy.

630
00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:55.200
He's a fan.
Yeah,
he was a good guy.
But I mean this dude was choosed.

631
00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:58.290
He was,
I mean five,
nine,

632
00:35:58.350 --> 00:36:00.780
two 70 somewhere around then,

633
00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:05.150
which doesn't happen in nature unless you're a fucking gorilla.
I mean,

634
00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:09.600
it just doesn't happen.
Like,
I don't know,
you,
you would have to,
to get that big,

635
00:36:09.601 --> 00:36:11.880
naturally,
you'd have to,
you couldn't have a job.

636
00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:15.610
You'd have to be eating 30,000 calories a day.
And at the gym,
I mean,

637
00:36:15.611 --> 00:36:18.930
you'd have to be lifting weights literally all day.
I mean,

638
00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:22.230
and you could probably maintain that amount of mass for a couple of years and

639
00:36:22.231 --> 00:36:26.040
then everything would break.
I mean,
it's just,
it doesn't happen in nature.

640
00:36:26.041 --> 00:36:28.800
And I looked at this dude,
I'm like,
you are going to fucking,

641
00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:33.510
you're going to enforce laws.
Hello Glass House.

642
00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:38.700
What kind of rock bus people for drugs,
motherfucker.

643
00:36:38.850 --> 00:36:42.750
Cause you're on a ton of them,
you know,
I mean that the steroids,
you know,

644
00:36:42.751 --> 00:36:46.830
call them drugs or hormones or whatever you want to call them.
And they,
the idea,

645
00:36:46.831 --> 00:36:50.490
and I've talked to guys in martial arts,
let's say,
uh,
you know,

646
00:36:50.491 --> 00:36:54.030
I have to be prepared because the people that I'm running into out on the
street,

647
00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:58.800
you know,
I'm running it to like really bad guys and I want to be enhanced like,

648
00:36:58.801 --> 00:37:02.280
okay,
what is it?
I'm not that familiar with it,
but like

649
00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:08.620
the research,
I understand it fucks with your mind.
Oh,
most definitely younger.

650
00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:12.960
You're obviously,
well,
I mean there's levels of course.

651
00:37:12.961 --> 00:37:16.350
Like everything else.
Like you could smoke a little pot and be fine,

652
00:37:16.351 --> 00:37:20.190
carry on a conversation or you can get so stoned,
you don't remember who you are.

653
00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:23.270
I mean,
you could really get fucked up.
You can get so stone.
You look at a phone,

654
00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:27.600
he like,
what is this?
You know,
you can get pretty fucked up,
right?

655
00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:30.420
Or You could take a little puff and just kicked back.

656
00:37:30.670 --> 00:37:34.000
Joe Talking about cocoa like that.
Coco knows what's up.

657
00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:38.850
He can't tolerate more than any living human being.
Joey Diaz can eat.

658
00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:43.020
He eats it mostly,
you know,
he'll have those pot edibles,
but he'll,

659
00:37:43.021 --> 00:37:47.190
he'll go so deep that you can't even believe he's still alive.
He just goes deep.

660
00:37:47.730 --> 00:37:52.620
But my point being is that I assume that some of these guys,

661
00:37:52.621 --> 00:37:57.621
you could take a small amount of steroids and probably it would help you recover

662
00:37:58.381 --> 00:38:01.770
and in,
but the problem with those guys is they can never get off of it.

663
00:38:02.010 --> 00:38:07.010
Like Joey Diaz has a friend that's been on steroids since 1987 a rod.

664
00:38:07.290 --> 00:38:10.370
Oh No,
I'm sorry.
We were talking about guys.
It's a different guy.
He's a,

665
00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:14.880
his friend from jersey,
that's a bodybuilder that has never gotten off steroids.

666
00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:19.680
He's literally been on steroids since 1987 and he's Joey's age.
You know,

667
00:38:19.681 --> 00:38:24.510
he's like 51 he's fine.
He's healthy.
He's fucking big as a house.

668
00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:28.740
He never stopped lifting.
Never stop doing steroids.
But I mean,
yeah,

669
00:38:28.741 --> 00:38:29.940
but he's a maniac.

670
00:38:30.210 --> 00:38:33.990
I think you could probably take a little bit and it would probably help you

671
00:38:33.991 --> 00:38:35.750
recover and you'll be all right.

672
00:38:35.770 --> 00:38:40.120
But most definitely if you take a lot like this cop that pulled me over,

673
00:38:40.330 --> 00:38:44.110
he had to be on all kinds of shit that's going to fuck with your temper.
I mean,

674
00:38:44.130 --> 00:38:46.210
you essentially become a different thing.

675
00:38:46.211 --> 00:38:49.390
We were kind of discussing this yesterday because there's an epidemic of

676
00:38:49.391 --> 00:38:53.500
steroids in the UFC.
I mean a true epidemic and not just the UFC,

677
00:38:53.501 --> 00:38:54.820
but MMA in general.

678
00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:57.550
There's been some high level guys that have tested positive and other

679
00:38:57.551 --> 00:38:59.300
organizations and uh,

680
00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:02.710
even guys that swore they never took anything and would mock other people who

681
00:39:02.711 --> 00:39:06.850
took performance enhancing drugs and they got popped.
Um,
so there's,

682
00:39:07.090 --> 00:39:12.090
there's a real issue that we're all as the mixed martial arts communities sort

683
00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:15.910
of coming to grips with now.
But as a police officer,

684
00:39:16.930 --> 00:39:21.870
I think being calm and having a sense of,

685
00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:26.140
of peacefulness,
of being able to defuse situations.

686
00:39:26.141 --> 00:39:30.740
Like that was my thing about the Trayvon Martin thing.
Um,
you know,

687
00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:33.520
when everybody was talking about George Zimmerman and the people that were

688
00:39:33.521 --> 00:39:35.530
supporting Zimmerman,
they were like,
you know,
hey,

689
00:39:35.531 --> 00:39:38.620
George Zimmerman had got attacked and Georgia.
I'm like,
okay,

690
00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:42.610
here's the problem with that.
George Zimmerman was a fucking moron,
first of all,

691
00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:45.310
first and foremost,
he wanted to be a cop.
They wouldn't let him be a cop,

692
00:39:45.311 --> 00:39:48.940
which is fucking bad,
which means you gotta be a real moron,
you know,

693
00:39:48.941 --> 00:39:51.850
because I've met some more onto the cops.
You know,

694
00:39:51.970 --> 00:39:56.410
most cops I meet are great folks,
but we all know a few idiots.

695
00:39:56.411 --> 00:40:00.130
It became cops.
This guy was too fucking stupid to be one of those idiots,

696
00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:02.260
you know?
They were like,
you're too dumb.
You can't be a cop.

697
00:40:02.261 --> 00:40:05.500
So they give him this job as this community patrol guy,
right?

698
00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:08.710
And second of all,
he let this kid,

699
00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:13.240
this young kid was kicking his fucking ass.
Young kid got on top of him,

700
00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:16.480
is beating his head off the curb.
Like,
okay,
well how did that happen?

701
00:40:16.481 --> 00:40:18.850
Do you not know how to fight it all?
If you don't know how to fight it all?

702
00:40:18.851 --> 00:40:20.110
How the fuck are you a cop?

703
00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:24.610
Here's the rub that no matter which version of the events you choose to believe,

704
00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:29.020
Trayvon stood his ground first is actually what happened.

705
00:40:29.230 --> 00:40:32.410
So this tree stand,
your ground situation becomes like,

706
00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:36.600
who wins it's becomes is it becomes a stare down at his face off.
It's,

707
00:40:36.730 --> 00:40:38.860
it's a shootout,
you know,
and it's like,
who wins?

708
00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:40.150
Because what happened was he was,

709
00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:44.020
he was being followed by some creepy dude with a gun.

710
00:40:44.530 --> 00:40:47.610
He was a kid coming back from seven 11 with Arizona,

711
00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:50.080
an guys walking back to his dad's house.

712
00:40:50.081 --> 00:40:52.470
But the creepy guy with a gun was a security guard.
Well,

713
00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:56.200
we was a neighborhood watch it.
Like it doesn't have like an half.
No,
no,
no.

714
00:40:56.210 --> 00:40:56.531
Opposite.

715
00:40:56.531 --> 00:41:00.070
Voluntary Yada had punk Chalana whenever he had it was raining and that's why

716
00:41:00.071 --> 00:41:00.940
Trayvon had a Hoodie on.

717
00:41:00.970 --> 00:41:05.320
It was raining so that he doesn't have anything that identifies them as security

718
00:41:05.321 --> 00:41:08.380
officer on the phone with nine one one and they're telling him,
stay in your car,

719
00:41:08.381 --> 00:41:11.130
sir.
Stay in your car.
Oh,
that's hilarious.
Yeah.

720
00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:13.120
And he gets out of the car and he's,
he's stuck.

721
00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:14.350
And this kid was on the phone with the,

722
00:41:14.351 --> 00:41:16.000
Trayvon was on the phone with this girl and he's like,

723
00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:19.810
there's some dude following me.
He's in his car.
He's getting out of his car.

724
00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:22.750
He's like,
and she was worried for him.
She's like,
as it turns out,

725
00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:25.630
he was a creepy dude with a gun who was stalking this.

726
00:41:25.631 --> 00:41:29.440
Katie was walking back to his dad's house with an ice tea and skittles.

727
00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:31.510
I actually wasn't aware that it didn't have an outfit,

728
00:41:31.511 --> 00:41:34.220
which is ridiculous neighborhood

729
00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:37.640
<v 1>watchman guy.
Nobody elected him or assigned him.</v>

730
00:41:37.730 --> 00:41:40.970
He took it upon himself because it was some robberies in the neighborhood and he

731
00:41:40.971 --> 00:41:44.570
went and stalked and he got jumped because this kid was scared,

732
00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:48.380
so there's no organization whatsoever.
It looks like a community organization,

733
00:41:48.381 --> 00:41:51.110
but I don't know that there's any formal,
I don't think that there,
there was a,

734
00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:53.960
he wasn't a member of any formal organization that I'm aware of.

735
00:41:53.961 --> 00:41:57.320
An eye I was tweeting about this and this was to me was just objective.

736
00:41:57.770 --> 00:42:02.510
These were just objective facts to me and what came into play was one of the

737
00:42:02.511 --> 00:42:06.710
most disturbing things.
I mean,
okay,
I'm all right.
I'm going to tell this story.

738
00:42:06.810 --> 00:42:10.040
I can herself a lot of people so down,

739
00:42:10.850 --> 00:42:14.780
so we have a fan page.
We did this documentary for ESPN called the you,
um,

740
00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:17.320
about the University of Miami football program.
We just did a sequel,
uh,

741
00:42:17.330 --> 00:42:20.960
late last year.
And so we had this fan page that we put on Facebook,

742
00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:24.670
which has about 885,000 or so vans and,

743
00:42:24.671 --> 00:42:28.640
and it's one of the most like kind of largest and most interactive pages for

744
00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:30.140
hurricanes,
football fans.

745
00:42:30.410 --> 00:42:35.410
So every once in a while I kind of troll the page you cause I troll my own page.

746
00:42:36.530 --> 00:42:41.030
Why does he do that as like a sociological experiment?
I don't know.

747
00:42:41.031 --> 00:42:44.510
Like we just like,
we'll just put like,
like Warren Sapp got,

748
00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:49.430
got busted for prostitution.
Yeah.
Uh,
couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.

749
00:42:49.431 --> 00:42:53.210
So stupidest fucking law over the stupidest,
stupidest law.
And to me,

750
00:42:53.250 --> 00:42:57.620
it's just an example of sort of these arcane,
patriarchal,
like women are less,

751
00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:59.810
women can't decide what to do with their bodies.

752
00:42:59.811 --> 00:43:01.730
We decide what they can do with their bodies and,

753
00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:06.110
and what contractual arrangements consenting adults can enter,
can enter into,

754
00:43:06.111 --> 00:43:09.290
but porns legal,
which it should be,
but then it's over there.

755
00:43:09.570 --> 00:43:13.550
There's a camera in the room that changes the entire dynamic.

756
00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:16.580
This was a girl that was hanging around the comedy store way back in the day

757
00:43:16.581 --> 00:43:20.030
that actually said that to one of my friends.
She was a porn star.

758
00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:22.420
And she said,
you know,
he,

759
00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:25.790
he somehow or another gone to this conversation and she said,

760
00:43:25.791 --> 00:43:28.160
you can fuck me as long as you have a camera in the room,
but shoot,

761
00:43:28.161 --> 00:43:31.850
we'll do a private shoot.
And he was like,
what?
It was like,
hold on.

762
00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:33.350
He was like trying to figure it out.

763
00:43:33.351 --> 00:43:37.040
So every time a woman told me that she had a fee,
you know,
she goes,

764
00:43:37.050 --> 00:43:40.130
you pay my fee,
you put a camera in the room and you can fuck me.
And he's like,

765
00:43:40.131 --> 00:43:43.340
says that prostitution,
she goes,
not legally.
And I'm like,
okay.

766
00:43:43.341 --> 00:43:46.090
And then we thought about it like,
yeah,
I guess that isn't prostitution dude.

767
00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:50.450
The resources,
the resources that police departments spend,

768
00:43:51.310 --> 00:43:55.100
you'd been these stings prostitution to create crime that otherwise wouldn't

769
00:43:55.101 --> 00:43:57.880
exist by cops dress up like cookers,

770
00:43:58.570 --> 00:44:02.480
which worst of all is dangerous for them.
Very right.
And second of all,

771
00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:04.250
they're just creating crime that doesn't,

772
00:44:04.310 --> 00:44:09.310
that wouldn't otherwise exist unless this cop trust is a hooker actually passed

773
00:44:09.411 --> 00:44:14.411
laws in certain states that make it legal for cops to have sex with prostitutes

774
00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:18.440
as part of the [inaudible] part of the sting,
which that seems that seems fair,

775
00:44:18.441 --> 00:44:22.400
whole areas.
That seems that seems right.
God damned hilarious.

776
00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:25.310
Why would anybody think that there's,
you know,

777
00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:28.910
there's two legal systems here in this country and make sure that none of these

778
00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:32.100
hoes around this sucking,
so I'm going to go get my

779
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:36.930
<v 2>dick sucked.
Just doing sure.
She knows I'm legit.
Yeah.
I'm,
I'm pretty sure</v>

780
00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:37.993
<v 3>by the way,</v>

781
00:44:38.350 --> 00:44:42.260
a contract is offer acceptance and consideration.

782
00:44:42.261 --> 00:44:45.590
I don't know that you actually have to deliver on it in order to say the

783
00:44:45.591 --> 00:44:48.440
contract.
This is an illegal contract that you've entered into.

784
00:44:48.441 --> 00:44:49.160
You're under arrest.

785
00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:53.180
I can't imagine that that's necessary to go into court and say,
it's like,
no,
no,

786
00:44:53.181 --> 00:44:58.040
your honor.
She's really a hooker.
I paid her and we had sex.

787
00:44:58.041 --> 00:45:01.100
Like,
is that really,
is that really necessary and how is that legal?

788
00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:01.371
<v 2>Well,</v>

789
00:45:01.371 --> 00:45:05.900
my friend got busted in a sting operation in New York and he was flirting with

790
00:45:05.901 --> 00:45:09.890
these girls.
And uh,
one of them said something like,

791
00:45:09.891 --> 00:45:13.220
you want a party or something like that.
And uh,
he's like partying.
Like,

792
00:45:13.221 --> 00:45:17.240
what does that mean?
Like what do you mean,
like sex?
And she goes,
yeah.

793
00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:20.270
And he goes,
um,
is it going to cost me anything?
She goes,

794
00:45:20.271 --> 00:45:22.670
how much do you want to pay me?
He goes,
$10,000.

795
00:45:22.850 --> 00:45:24.940
Like he's just joking around and get the take down in order.

796
00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:27.280
And they fucking around with them.
Like that crane,

797
00:45:27.350 --> 00:45:30.230
he was a drunk guy coming out of a bar,

798
00:45:30.231 --> 00:45:33.740
flirting with some girls that he didn't know where cops and they were

799
00:45:33.741 --> 00:45:37.130
manipulating the language in order to get him to say that,

800
00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:39.440
like he was just being a silly goose.
He,

801
00:45:39.590 --> 00:45:41.960
he's just being a silly guy trying to meet.
He's a comic.

802
00:45:41.961 --> 00:45:45.110
So he's just trying to make these girls laugh like $10,000,

803
00:45:45.350 --> 00:45:48.860
like saying $10,000,
who the fuck is going to pay a street walker?

804
00:45:48.861 --> 00:45:52.970
$10,000 we'll even comes up with that of their first offer.

805
00:45:53.450 --> 00:45:56.390
I mean for $10,000 you can fuck me.

806
00:45:56.400 --> 00:46:00.110
He was a famous porn star for $10,000 offer.
Yeah,

807
00:46:00.111 --> 00:46:01.760
I mean it's maybe been numbing.

808
00:46:01.850 --> 00:46:04.610
<v 3>If it had been a counter offer,</v>

809
00:46:04.611 --> 00:46:09.260
it would have been more reasonable over $10,000.
If he said,
you know,

810
00:46:09.261 --> 00:46:12.710
500 and she said a million.
And he's like,
Whoa,
hold on.

811
00:46:12.740 --> 00:46:16.880
When you consider these two,
these two women officers,
you consider their backup,

812
00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:21.370
you consider the surveillance,
you consider then when you have to process a John,

813
00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:24.710
when he was in jail for 24 hours,
you have to PR and the,

814
00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:28.790
the manpower involved in processing.
Okay.

815
00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:34.220
What other crime was going on that night?
Uh,
like victim,
victim,
victim less,

816
00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:38.420
but victim,
full victim.
Full farm was occurring.
Oh my God.
Oh,
I totally,

817
00:46:38.490 --> 00:46:42.600
I totally dodged the,
uh,
the trolling my own page bullet.
You,

818
00:46:42.601 --> 00:46:45.090
what should I tell that story?
So we'll keep going with this.
Okay.

819
00:46:45.110 --> 00:46:49.960
I never told this story,
uh,
uh,
to any public leadpages.
This,
that you should eat.

820
00:46:49.970 --> 00:46:53.000
It's facebook.com forward slash the you movie.
Okay.

821
00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:54.650
So once in a while when I see troll the page,

822
00:46:54.651 --> 00:46:57.680
I mean we're kind of like the New York post of the,

823
00:46:57.681 --> 00:47:00.920
you have like UN football fan pages were like the tabloid,
you know,

824
00:47:01.010 --> 00:47:04.160
we don't just post the press releases that come out of the athletic department,

825
00:47:04.310 --> 00:47:08.930
we'll post whatever that's kind of like peripherally involved in Miami football

826
00:47:08.931 --> 00:47:12.020
or pop culture surrounding Miami football.
You know,

827
00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:15.350
snoop throws up the U and a music video,
shit like that.
You know.
So

828
00:47:16.970 --> 00:47:19.910
on the day of the Zimmerman verdict,

829
00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:24.890
there was a picture that had been on the Internet for some time from like

830
00:47:24.891 --> 00:47:28.520
Trayvon Martins 11th birthday or something like that,

831
00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:30.520
where his parents are,

832
00:47:30.521 --> 00:47:34.030
who am whomever got him a birthday cake with the IU logo.

833
00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:36.040
He was apparently a hurricane's fan.

834
00:47:36.490 --> 00:47:41.490
I know he's a south Florida kid and so it was it him smiling 11 year old kid and

835
00:47:42.551 --> 00:47:46.540
his universe,
you em,
happy birthday cake.
Great.

836
00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:50.620
So I was just like,
you know what I'm going to do?
I'm not gonna say a word.

837
00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:55.920
I'm going to post this picture to the Facebook page and I can't tell you how

838
00:47:57.731 --> 00:48:01.150
like all social media hell broke loose in that community.

839
00:48:01.151 --> 00:48:06.151
And I would venture to say that you could write papers on the state of America's

840
00:48:06.881 --> 00:48:11.140
race relations based solely on the comments from that,

841
00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:12.220
from that image.

842
00:48:12.250 --> 00:48:17.250
It was one of the most disturbing just exchanges about America and race and

843
00:48:19.451 --> 00:48:22.900
crime that I have just ever seen in my life.

844
00:48:22.901 --> 00:48:25.870
It was so disturbing and I just left it there and let them,
you know,

845
00:48:25.871 --> 00:48:29.110
it was kind of like a war shark and people were writing like private messages

846
00:48:29.111 --> 00:48:33.000
like I'm on,
I'm unfriending or unliking this page.
Um,

847
00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:35.330
why don't you post a picture of Oh,

848
00:48:35.331 --> 00:48:39.490
of course that's not what he looked like when,
you know,
a,

849
00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:42.880
when he was killed and they post like one of those fake pictures of like some

850
00:48:42.881 --> 00:48:45.610
rapper that like people claimed it was Trayvon and like,

851
00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:50.110
like things that were debunked,
you know,
by a scopes and otherwise like,
you know,

852
00:48:50.111 --> 00:48:51.400
months or years earlier.

853
00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:56.230
And just like the craziness that ensued and the Ma and I'm like,

854
00:48:56.231 --> 00:48:56.591
hey listen,

855
00:48:56.591 --> 00:49:01.150
you find a picture of a George Zimmerman and a you sweater or whatever.

856
00:49:01.151 --> 00:49:04.870
I'll post that too.
I mean like what do you want?
This is,
it was just,

857
00:49:04.980 --> 00:49:08.110
cause I posted pictures of Barack Obama throwing up the u and then Mitt Romney

858
00:49:08.111 --> 00:49:10.060
was campaigning and he threw up the,
you didn't,
you're like,

859
00:49:10.210 --> 00:49:12.460
well did you throw up to you?
Do you go with this?
Yeah.
You just put your,

860
00:49:12.461 --> 00:49:14.720
well it's more like,
yeah,
it's,
it's like this.
Yeah.

861
00:49:15.010 --> 00:49:17.740
I sort of put a break in it cause there's like era between,
but like you said,

862
00:49:17.890 --> 00:49:20.640
yeah.
But like yeah,
that's,
that's how you,
that's how you sold you.

863
00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:23.170
But essentially,
but let me get to the point here.

864
00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:26.920
Essentially it was white people who were being racist against Trayvon Martin and

865
00:49:26.921 --> 00:49:31.360
were upset that you were posting this image of him with this Uk.

866
00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:34.810
No one was objective looking at the facts of the situation.

867
00:49:34.811 --> 00:49:39.610
They saw a black kid in a hoodie and right away it was thug who gobble was

868
00:49:39.611 --> 00:49:42.880
coming to him.
And it didn't matter that he was a human being.

869
00:49:42.940 --> 00:49:45.550
It didn't matter that he was,
he had smoked pot before.
It's like,

870
00:49:45.551 --> 00:49:49.750
I can't believe the teenage kids,
Teenage Pot's illegal in Florida.

871
00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:53.320
The kid never got into trouble for anything before,
and it's like he,
he got,

872
00:49:53.321 --> 00:49:56.470
he got,
he got in a little bit of trouble in school,
which teenage kids do.

873
00:49:56.471 --> 00:49:59.300
He's from a broken home and his mom sent him to spend,
he said,
Mike,

874
00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:01.990
my son needs to spend time with his father.
I'm going to send them up to SPEC.

875
00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:05.680
This was,
these were good people.
This was a good family.
None of it mattered.

876
00:50:05.890 --> 00:50:09.270
A just mattered that he was black and,
and,

877
00:50:09.550 --> 00:50:13.180
and there was people who just literally,
I'm not suggesting that was everybody,

878
00:50:13.181 --> 00:50:17.800
but there were people who just could not get beyond that,
which was just,

879
00:50:18.020 --> 00:50:21.570
it led me to like this whole,
this whole,
Ah,
you know,
the,

880
00:50:21.610 --> 00:50:22.311
I don't know if you remember the,

881
00:50:22.311 --> 00:50:26.320
the closing the closing argument in a time to kill Matthew mcconaughey.

882
00:50:26.530 --> 00:50:28.070
It's like few really think I wants to

883
00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:30.840
<v 2>fucking,
no,
I seriously doubt that.
But it's like,
it's,</v>

884
00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:35.140
it's this whole monologue where he gives you this fact pattern about this,

885
00:50:35.210 --> 00:50:39.170
this young girl being kidnapped and raped and abused and beaten within an inch

886
00:50:39.171 --> 00:50:42.190
of her life.
And then he says,
now imagine she's white.
Meaning like,

887
00:50:42.410 --> 00:50:46.520
just take the same set of facts and puts your kid there.
You know,

888
00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:50.420
the only reason Zimmerman was following him in the first place,

889
00:50:50.510 --> 00:50:53.680
or scripts on either suspicious or switch the race.

890
00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:59.160
Absolutely Zimmerman be a black guy with a cop complex,

891
00:50:59.750 --> 00:51:00.770
you know?
Well,
well,

892
00:51:00.890 --> 00:51:03.830
my point was initially when we started talking about this is that he's so

893
00:51:03.831 --> 00:51:08.831
socially unskilled that another guy who may be was a good cop or another guy who

894
00:51:10.161 --> 00:51:14.390
was good with people would have seen this young kid walking and said,

895
00:51:14.391 --> 00:51:17.240
how you doing brother?
Everything good tonight?
And like,
yeah man,
what's up?

896
00:51:17.390 --> 00:51:19.310
You know,
what are you doing?
Just getting some skittles.
All right,

897
00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:23.390
we'll take care,
man.
It's great to get dirty.
Fucking hair.
Get,
go,
get dry.

898
00:51:23.710 --> 00:51:26.450
All right,
you too man.
And then we're good.
You know?
I mean,
how many,

899
00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:31.750
how many of those exchanges between two human beings could vary radically

900
00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:35.660
depending on the social skills of the person.
That's quote unquote,

901
00:51:35.661 --> 00:51:36.770
in a position of power.

902
00:51:37.010 --> 00:51:39.860
And that's an issue with what we were talking about earlier with steroids

903
00:51:40.010 --> 00:51:44.530
distorting people's aggression,
distorting people's perception of,
of,

904
00:51:44.540 --> 00:51:49.440
of danger or of their,
their power over a situation or what's,

905
00:51:49.441 --> 00:51:51.290
what's just and what's ethical.

906
00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:54.680
Law enforcement officers are allegedly trained to deescalate.

907
00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:57.410
They should do to office.
Most often.

908
00:51:57.411 --> 00:52:01.850
We're seeing these stories thanks to the Internet of situations where calling

909
00:52:01.851 --> 00:52:06.140
the police turns an otherwise benign situation,
potentially deadly.

910
00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:08.260
And that's a frightening thought,
the,

911
00:52:08.330 --> 00:52:10.490
because even if these are isolated incidents,

912
00:52:10.850 --> 00:52:15.650
the proliferation of them and our exposure to them now thanks to the Internet is

913
00:52:15.651 --> 00:52:18.410
creating an environment where kids are actually feeling like,

914
00:52:18.411 --> 00:52:22.040
I maybe I shouldn't call the police.
Maybe that's not what I should do.

915
00:52:22.041 --> 00:52:26.240
And you shouldn't ever feel that way.
You know,
you shouldn't have that feeling.

916
00:52:26.241 --> 00:52:30.440
But I started to lose a lot of,
like,
when I say friends,
I mean,
you know,

917
00:52:30.441 --> 00:52:34.040
social media,
Fred friends in quotes,
uh,
friends and followers on Twitter.

918
00:52:34.250 --> 00:52:38.840
And I finally just like,
after the verdict,
I was like,
listen,
it's all good.

919
00:52:39.140 --> 00:52:41.900
If you want to follow me for my Trayvon Zimmerman tweets,

920
00:52:42.050 --> 00:52:44.330
if Zimmerman had unfollowed Trayvon,

921
00:52:44.331 --> 00:52:48.770
we wouldn't even be fucking talking about this.
Damn.
He dropped the bomb on them.

922
00:52:49.490 --> 00:52:52.940
Yeah.
Look,
he was a dummy.
He's a dummy who can't fight,

923
00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:57.440
who wanted to be a tough guy and Florida.
This Florida kid getting on top of him.

924
00:52:57.441 --> 00:53:00.710
I'm beating his fucking ass and then he shoots him.
You know,

925
00:53:01.250 --> 00:53:04.280
I just wish someone had taught Trayvon a little better and he could have put

926
00:53:04.281 --> 00:53:07.100
that fucker to sleep before I ever got the gun out.
You know,

927
00:53:07.970 --> 00:53:12.320
you just can't have a person that's so socially unscaled,

928
00:53:12.321 --> 00:53:14.180
which has obviously been proven now

929
00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:17.630
subsequent Jesus fucking Christ,

930
00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:22.230
he pulled a gun out on someone in some sort of a car situation.

931
00:53:22.231 --> 00:53:25.500
He threw a wine bottle and maniac.
Apparently he's a,

932
00:53:25.530 --> 00:53:28.570
he's a con con of a human being.

933
00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:32.250
He's going to kill somebody some day jail while he's probably in jail for a long

934
00:53:32.251 --> 00:53:37.230
time now,
right?
No,
no,
no,
no.
He got picked up on that domestic abuse.

935
00:53:37.290 --> 00:53:40.130
A wrap with his ex girlfriend.
Yeah.
He threw a wine bottle ladder.

936
00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:43.050
She won't cooperate anymore.
She's not pressing he's house.
Yeah.

937
00:53:43.051 --> 00:53:44.970
I'm pretty sure he's out now.
You know what,

938
00:53:44.971 --> 00:53:48.240
I'm not a Florida fan of vigilante justice unless it's a guy like that.

939
00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:51.450
And then I'm like,
you know,
that's a day that said that by the way,

940
00:53:51.460 --> 00:53:56.310
that wasn't this
vigilante justice.
But when it comes get free,

941
00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:58.590
[inaudible] is not an endorsement.

942
00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:02.880
People up to fire up torches fucking fine with that cunt sleeping.

943
00:54:03.690 --> 00:54:05.430
It's just,
he's a bad person.

944
00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:09.640
He's a bad person that's already done bad things and you know,
I mean,

945
00:54:09.650 --> 00:54:14.100
it's probably going to continue to do not good.
Maybe.
I mean,
and also he's,

946
00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:17.250
he's become a hero of the Ted Nugent crowd.
You know,

947
00:54:17.251 --> 00:54:20.580
the people that are standing up for the second amendment and he's,
you know,

948
00:54:20.581 --> 00:54:22.980
what he did was he shot an and,
uh,
you know,
uh,

949
00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:27.990
unlawful thug or that's fucking retarded,
man.

950
00:54:27.991 --> 00:54:30.270
And I'm a person who supports the right to bear arms.

951
00:54:30.271 --> 00:54:34.550
Just remember the kid did not commit any crimes.
Even jumping.

952
00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:38.310
He was standing his ground.
What is that?
This guy was stalking him with a gun.

953
00:54:38.311 --> 00:54:41.400
There's no set of facts.
Even the waves,
Zimmerman tells it.

954
00:54:41.550 --> 00:54:46.230
There's no set of facts that are set of a version of the story that changes

955
00:54:46.231 --> 00:54:46.740
those facts.

956
00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:51.740
He was stalking a kid who was armed with an Arizona ice tea and skittles walking

957
00:54:51.991 --> 00:54:56.710
back to his dad's house and he killed him.
Neato.
He might've been on pot,

958
00:54:56.800 --> 00:54:58.890
so on the pot.
He was on the pot.

959
00:54:58.950 --> 00:55:03.180
I think the Michael Brown situation is far more confusing because I wish I knew

960
00:55:03.181 --> 00:55:04.170
what really happened.

961
00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:06.990
I wish I knew everybody putting their arms up in the air and doing this.

962
00:55:06.991 --> 00:55:08.580
Hands up.
Don't shoot shit.

963
00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:11.910
I really wished that was proven that that actually did happen.

964
00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:13.230
Maybe perhaps a video.

965
00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:17.940
The way more disturbing story to me was that 12 year old who was shot with a toy

966
00:55:17.970 --> 00:55:22.590
gun and a cops just hold up.
Yeah.
The cops just pull up within two seconds,

967
00:55:22.740 --> 00:55:25.770
unload on him.
All on video,
all on video.

968
00:55:25.771 --> 00:55:29.660
No confusion whatsoever is another situation where the lack of empathy to me and

969
00:55:29.710 --> 00:55:33.750
in the Twitter versus just like staggering cause it's like what was this kid

970
00:55:33.751 --> 00:55:35.610
doing with a toy gun?
I'm like,

971
00:55:35.820 --> 00:55:40.370
I grew up at the park playing with scraps and robbers and war.
What do you want?

972
00:55:40.371 --> 00:55:43.980
I mean,
what?
What are you talking about?
Of course he was in the park.

973
00:55:43.981 --> 00:55:47.580
You can't even address 20 can't even address that.
Those are fools and they're,

974
00:55:47.581 --> 00:55:52.260
they're looking for some reason where this kid,
it was culpable,
you know,

975
00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:56.810
but thinking gains the kid move up right on top of them,

976
00:55:57.130 --> 00:56:00.320
jumped out of the car and open fun.
See,
what's more disturbing to me is,

977
00:56:00.321 --> 00:56:05.321
is the fact that that you have a trend where you have a version of events

978
00:56:05.341 --> 00:56:08.760
perpetuated by the police,
which is usually always the first story you ever read.

979
00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:10.950
It's a press release or the statement from the police.

980
00:56:11.250 --> 00:56:13.590
So it's never innocent until proven guilty.

981
00:56:13.591 --> 00:56:15.750
It's like we charging this guy or we arrested this guy,

982
00:56:15.860 --> 00:56:18.600
this rooms that were arrested for resisting arrest,

983
00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:20.400
that didn't do a Goddamn what they call that,

984
00:56:20.401 --> 00:56:24.040
that's called contempt of cop because there's never a basis to

985
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:27.040
<v 3>arrest them in the first place.
So if you're being arrested for resisting arrest,</v>

986
00:56:27.310 --> 00:56:30.700
what was the,
what was the original charge that you were being arrested for?

987
00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:35.110
How can you just,
the vast majority of those cases are dismissed.
And guess what?

988
00:56:35.390 --> 00:56:39.340
Uh,
uh,
Bratton that police commission end YPD wants to escalate,

989
00:56:39.341 --> 00:56:42.700
has gone to the legislature to,
uh,
to elevate contempt.

990
00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:45.610
Go take contempt of cop.
That's what they call that contempt of cop.

991
00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:50.530
He wants to escalate or elevate the charge of resisting arrest from a

992
00:56:50.531 --> 00:56:52.450
misdemeanor to a felony.
Now again,

993
00:56:52.570 --> 00:56:55.870
most of those charges will wind up being dropped as they usually do because

994
00:56:55.871 --> 00:56:58.390
they're completely bogus.
It's contempt of cop.

995
00:56:58.391 --> 00:57:02.140
It's a situation where it's like he didn't listen to me.
Right.
Which is again,

996
00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:03.700
what we were talking about before,
the version,

997
00:57:03.740 --> 00:57:06.040
the difference between deescalation.
You can beat the rap.

998
00:57:06.041 --> 00:57:07.060
You can't beat the ride.

999
00:57:07.330 --> 00:57:11.550
Your boy was in jail for 24 frigging ours might have had to hire an attorney.

1000
00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:13.840
Might have had some people get their car impounded,

1001
00:57:13.841 --> 00:57:16.240
depending on what town in the prostitution sting sting's.

1002
00:57:16.450 --> 00:57:18.490
Those are major revenue generators,

1003
00:57:18.700 --> 00:57:21.280
major revenue generators for the criminal justice system,

1004
00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:26.220
all the way from law enforcement to tow yards to a asset forfeiture too.

1005
00:57:26.370 --> 00:57:29.220
<v 2>Asset forfeiture,
which is amazing.
What people don't even know about legal.</v>

1006
00:57:29.490 --> 00:57:34.200
Take your car.
You could have a very nice car,
like say you have a $50,000 car.

1007
00:57:34.350 --> 00:57:37.680
That's the states now they steal your fucking work as a police department.

1008
00:57:37.681 --> 00:57:39.990
It's a local,
they get the,
they take the,

1009
00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:43.880
<v 3>keep it sound like they,
they turned it over to anybody.
If they want something,</v>

1010
00:57:43.970 --> 00:57:45.590
they could literally go out and take it.

1011
00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:49.820
You don't even have to be convicted of a crime just charged or accused.
Right.

1012
00:57:49.850 --> 00:57:53.120
And you might never see.
They could take cash from you.

1013
00:57:53.180 --> 00:57:55.630
<v 2>Yes.
Well why?
Why do you have that cash,
sir?</v>

1014
00:57:55.670 --> 00:57:58.400
Were you doing something illegal with that cat?
I think you might've been.

1015
00:57:58.401 --> 00:58:00.770
So we're going to lock that guilty until proven innocent and then we're going to

1016
00:58:00.771 --> 00:58:04.130
use that cash to have fucking parties.
You know what I mean?
They,
they use those,

1017
00:58:04.210 --> 00:58:06.290
those,
the,
the,
the funds that they steal.

1018
00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:11.320
They didn't have to buy pads and buy cars and boats and the parties and you ran

1019
00:58:11.391 --> 00:58:16.280
a similar scam in Los Angeles for a long time with arresting people that were

1020
00:58:16.281 --> 00:58:18.550
running medical marijuana dispensaries there.

1021
00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:21.640
There's video of this where these fucking kids or college kids,

1022
00:58:21.830 --> 00:58:24.230
they're young kids,
they're not doing anything wrong.

1023
00:58:24.231 --> 00:58:27.680
They're working in a place where the state law says it's a legal business.

1024
00:58:27.830 --> 00:58:31.430
They break in guns strapped,
bulletproof vest,

1025
00:58:31.490 --> 00:58:35.900
ATF fucking outfits.
They put guns to people's head,

1026
00:58:36.020 --> 00:58:38.270
held this kid on the ground,
stepped on his fucking neck.

1027
00:58:38.270 --> 00:58:40.970
I mean there's videos of all the zip tie them the whole deal.

1028
00:58:41.420 --> 00:58:44.090
Then they take all their selling legal weed they take,
yes,

1029
00:58:44.180 --> 00:58:48.290
they took all their cash,
all of it take all their marijuana,
all of it.

1030
00:58:48.620 --> 00:58:53.360
And they say,
we are going to process your case.
And then they do nothing.

1031
00:58:53.870 --> 00:58:58.580
They do nothing.
They never prosecute that robbery.
Well,

1032
00:58:58.581 --> 00:59:00.650
that's what we used to call.
Yeah,
good.
It is on.

1033
00:59:00.651 --> 00:59:03.860
But they take that money and then because these guys don't want to go after that

1034
00:59:03.861 --> 00:59:07.040
money,
try to get it back because then the DEA comes out him even harder.
Right.

1035
00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:12.200
They use that money to fight to get that money back as much in legal fees as was

1036
00:59:12.801 --> 00:59:16.000
stolen in the first place.
It becomes a cancel each other out.
Yeah.
Yeah,

1037
00:59:16.001 --> 00:59:19.190
and I saw that you could sue the DEA to get your legal fees paid.

1038
00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:20.060
They're not going to pay it.

1039
00:59:20.090 --> 00:59:22.370
It's the same problem with did and they also don't care.

1040
00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:27.020
Even if they have to pay legal fees,
individual officers are never held liable.

1041
00:59:27.021 --> 00:59:29.790
It's not their money.
It's all our money anyway.
Right.

1042
00:59:29.840 --> 00:59:34.120
That gets paid when there are wrongful death suits or there's brutality suits or

1043
00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:36.190
B,
they don't care.
They're never punished.

1044
00:59:36.191 --> 00:59:39.830
The unions completely insulate and protect them and it's not their money.

1045
00:59:40.070 --> 00:59:43.710
At worst case scenario,
they get to retire early with a full pension.
The,

1046
00:59:43.790 --> 00:59:46.700
it has to be an unbelievably offensive

1047
00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:52.910
violation of the law for the cops to be prosecuted.
Prosecuted.
I mean,

1048
00:59:52.940 --> 00:59:57.290
it has to be like really outrageous where the,
the state steps in and says,

1049
00:59:57.291 --> 01:00:00.810
we've got to do something here or we're going to face a riot.
You know,
look,

1050
01:00:00.820 --> 01:00:03.930
the riots they have in Ferguson,
like the riots there,
having all,

1051
01:00:03.931 --> 01:00:07.160
all throughout the country about Eric Gardner.
You know what I mean?

1052
01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:10.610
I don't think anybody,
I really believe this,

1053
01:00:11.390 --> 01:00:14.870
and this is from a life long of experience with police officers.

1054
01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:18.080
I don't think anybody is qualified for that job for a long period of time.

1055
01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:21.080
I think being a cop is something that you can only do for a very short amount of

1056
01:00:21.081 --> 01:00:22.700
time.
Just like being a soldier.

1057
01:00:23.070 --> 01:00:27.530
You know that one soldier that went fucking crazy and Iraq and wound up gunning

1058
01:00:27.531 --> 01:00:32.120
down all those innocent people and you know,
they pulled this guy aside and like,

1059
01:00:32.121 --> 01:00:32.241
well,

1060
01:00:32.241 --> 01:00:37.241
this guy had been flagged for PTSD many times and he was saying himself like,

1061
01:00:37.611 --> 01:00:38.510
I gotta get Outta here.

1062
01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:41.930
And they sent him back over there again and he just went fucking crazy.

1063
01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:47.200
I think that the mind can only withstand so much stress and being a cop is a

1064
01:00:47.361 --> 01:00:50.420
fucking insanely stressful job and they see horrible things,

1065
01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:53.960
which is why I don't,
I'm not a big fan of these blanket statements.

1066
01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:57.290
Like you know,
I have friends who are like fuck the police and I'm like no,

1067
01:00:57.291 --> 01:00:59.870
stop saying that man.
Cause it's some shit goes down.

1068
01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:02.480
You're going to want to call the fucking police.
It's not fuck the police.

1069
01:01:02.481 --> 01:01:06.200
Just like when a black person rob somebody,
it's not fucked by a blab.
Absolutely.

1070
01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:08.070
Absolutely.
It's not man,
it's she's,

1071
01:01:08.090 --> 01:01:12.470
these are rash generalizations and they're based on this premise that anybody

1072
01:01:12.471 --> 01:01:15.530
could actually do that job.
Correct.
But here in lies the problem wrong.

1073
01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:18.260
Herein lies the problem.
The public sector as far as I'm concerned,

1074
01:01:18.261 --> 01:01:22.090
should be held to a higher standard of accountability,
not a lower or no account.

1075
01:01:22.170 --> 01:01:23.003
I agree with you.

1076
01:01:23.030 --> 01:01:26.750
If you are going to have the power and the authority to deprive people of life,

1077
01:01:26.751 --> 01:01:29.210
liberty,
and property,
you need to be held to a higher standard.

1078
01:01:29.211 --> 01:01:32.870
And a lack of accountability that police officers see happen all over the

1079
01:01:32.871 --> 01:01:37.040
country feeds this con this,
this mental idea that you might,

1080
01:01:37.150 --> 01:01:40.130
you might very well be right.
That might be a mental deficiency,

1081
01:01:40.131 --> 01:01:45.131
might be a form of PTSD that you might actually believe that you're above the

1082
01:01:45.261 --> 01:01:47.930
law,
that they don't,
the laws don't apply to you because as you said,

1083
01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:51.530
only in the most extreme and extraordinary cases or police officers ever,

1084
01:01:51.710 --> 01:01:56.490
ever prosecuted.
Uh,
and I don't think there needs to be a,
or there should be a,

1085
01:01:56.530 --> 01:02:01.260
a,
a,
a,
you know,
any kind of referendum or any kind of like,
uh,
uh,

1086
01:02:01.350 --> 01:02:02.320
uh,
I dunno,

1087
01:02:02.330 --> 01:02:05.900
like an idea that there's a certain number of police officers need to be proud.

1088
01:02:05.901 --> 01:02:08.390
Of course not.
When someone commits a crime out of care,
if they're black,

1089
01:02:08.391 --> 01:02:12.530
white or blue.
Okay.
You know,
you need there,
no,
it doesn't need to be a quota.

1090
01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:16.370
There just needs to be justice.
Equally applied.
And that's the,
you know,
in Miami,

1091
01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:21.060
in the 1980s people,
I mean,
you think if I was here for the Rodney King Riots,

1092
01:02:21.260 --> 01:02:24.760
<v 3>uh,
in Los Angeles,
um,
and so when I think of rat race riots or you know,</v>

1093
01:02:24.770 --> 01:02:27.840
you think of Detroit or Watser or Rodney King or,

1094
01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:32.580
but Miami was the race riot capital of America.

1095
01:02:32.581 --> 01:02:37.260
In the 1980s,
we had no less than three incidents.
All involving police officers.

1096
01:02:37.261 --> 01:02:41.130
You have mostly white and Hispanic police officers shooting and killing a,

1097
01:02:41.131 --> 01:02:44.410
or in the case of the first one beating to death,
uh,

1098
01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:46.620
a black unarmed black men.

1099
01:02:46.950 --> 01:02:51.320
And they all resulted in horrific,
uh,

1100
01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:52.110
race riots.

1101
01:02:52.110 --> 01:02:55.710
Some neighborhoods in Miami have never fully recovered from the 1980 [inaudible]

1102
01:02:55.830 --> 01:03:00.490
riots.
You still see empty,
undeveloped entire city blocks that,

1103
01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:04.650
that were burned down during those 1980 rights that people have not come back

1104
01:03:04.651 --> 01:03:08.070
and reinvested in those,
uh,
in those African American communities.

1105
01:03:08.071 --> 01:03:13.020
And we had that in 1980,
83,
uh,
and 89,
when the,

1106
01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:15.840
when the eyes of the world were on Miami for the Super Bowl is supposed to be,

1107
01:03:15.841 --> 01:03:19.020
oh,
we get all this good publicity.
We're having this,
this worldclass event.

1108
01:03:19.410 --> 01:03:22.800
The city was burning because of,
uh,
an officer who had had,
uh,

1109
01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:25.830
he had first been convicted,
if I'm not mistaken.

1110
01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:30.390
And then it was overturned on appeal and he went free.
And,
uh,

1111
01:03:30.420 --> 01:03:31.253
w we rioted

1112
01:03:31.290 --> 01:03:35.010
<v 2>what did you think about what happened in New York where those cops got killed</v>

1113
01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:39.340
and then they sent out this order?
I don't Dunno what,

1114
01:03:39.990 --> 01:03:42.990
how it was,
how it was dictated,
but the,

1115
01:03:43.110 --> 01:03:44.880
the idea was they weren't going to arrest anybody

1116
01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:51.150
for anything that wasn't necessary.
It was then,
but my take on it was,

1117
01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:53.580
that should be how cops always off.
Fantastic.

1118
01:03:53.670 --> 01:03:57.390
You should always only arrest people for something that's absolutely necessary.

1119
01:03:57.391 --> 01:03:58.230
Yes,
of course.

1120
01:03:58.231 --> 01:04:02.310
So what the fuck is this like you for a short period of time went back to

1121
01:04:02.311 --> 01:04:07.311
actually being someone who withholds the piece or an enforces the piece or keeps

1122
01:04:07.681 --> 01:04:08.400
the peace.

1123
01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:12.360
And then from there they went back to being revenue collectors because that's

1124
01:04:12.361 --> 01:04:16.020
what the fuck is really going on.
When that kid,
Eric Garner,
that gentlemen,

1125
01:04:16.410 --> 01:04:20.730
which a kid,
he's older,
that guy got dragged to the ground and choked,

1126
01:04:20.850 --> 01:04:23.160
didn't have any loose cigarettes on him,
wasn't selling thing.

1127
01:04:23.430 --> 01:04:24.121
And people are like,

1128
01:04:24.121 --> 01:04:28.560
oh that guy had 30 different prior arrests and uh oh he resisted arrest.

1129
01:04:28.890 --> 01:04:30.420
That's not resisting arrest.

1130
01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:33.480
When you take a fucking innocent person and you violate their rights and you

1131
01:04:33.481 --> 01:04:35.400
grabbed him around the neck and throw them to the ground,

1132
01:04:35.550 --> 01:04:36.960
that should've never happened in the first place.

1133
01:04:36.961 --> 01:04:40.740
And the only reason it happened because of taxes,
that's it.

1134
01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:43.250
That guy should have never been arrested.
You know,

1135
01:04:43.260 --> 01:04:44.990
you have to remember the river,
you have to remember he's never

1136
01:04:45.210 --> 01:04:48.560
<v 3>been accused of a capital crime.
He wasn't committing a capital crime.</v>

1137
01:04:48.710 --> 01:04:49.610
And even if you were,

1138
01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:52.340
which is to say that he was facing the death penalty for whatever he was being

1139
01:04:52.341 --> 01:04:56.180
accused of.
That's not how we carry out justice in this country.

1140
01:04:56.240 --> 01:05:00.290
You don't get choked to death on the street like an animal.
That's not how,

1141
01:05:00.710 --> 01:05:01.850
that's not how we roll.

1142
01:05:03.530 --> 01:05:06.810
<v 2>But,
but when you will know that they even tried to claim it wasn't a choke,</v>

1143
01:05:08.010 --> 01:05:10.440
which I had a stack of a technicality.
Yeah.
Well,

1144
01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:14.220
technically that's what I do for a living.
So he was like,
that's a fucking choke,

1145
01:05:14.250 --> 01:05:16.650
you know,
let me do it to you and let me tell you if you could breathe real good,

1146
01:05:16.930 --> 01:05:17.890
that's ridiculous.

1147
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:20.710
<v 1>You grabbing your forum around that guy's neck and squeezing,</v>

1148
01:05:20.711 --> 01:05:24.870
that's a fucking choke.
Well,
I think you're right.
I think it exposed,
uh,

1149
01:05:25.270 --> 01:05:28.300
policing for profit.
I,
and that's the real issue.
Yeah.

1150
01:05:28.390 --> 01:05:33.150
New York City wasn't suddenly a lawless fucking been running Gotham city tat,

1151
01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:36.180
I mean,
nothing happened.
Nothing happened.
What,

1152
01:05:36.230 --> 01:05:40.600
what happened was that innocent people stopped getting harassed for no reason on

1153
01:05:40.601 --> 01:05:45.280
the street over Penny Ante Revenue Generating a law ordinance.

1154
01:05:45.281 --> 01:05:48.460
And in that sense,
it's not even the fall of the cops.

1155
01:05:48.461 --> 01:05:52.600
The cops were being forced into these situations where they become revenue

1156
01:05:52.601 --> 01:05:53.434
collectors.

1157
01:05:53.530 --> 01:05:57.370
Like these cops are being forced to go back and start policing as usual because

1158
01:05:57.371 --> 01:06:02.140
they have fucking quotas.
And people that say,
oh,
quotas were bullshit.
No,

1159
01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:06.550
you have to research it.
They're,
the quotas are fucking real.
They're 100% real,

1160
01:06:07.030 --> 01:06:11.410
uh,
an organization,
a great local blog,
uh,
Crespo,
Graham in,

1161
01:06:11.411 --> 01:06:15.400
in Miami who does a lot,
he's like obsessed.
We have this chapter one 19,

1162
01:06:15.401 --> 01:06:16.240
these public record laws,

1163
01:06:16.241 --> 01:06:18.550
we called them sunshine laws where everything's in the sunshine.

1164
01:06:18.890 --> 01:06:20.800
It doesn't quite always work that way in Florida,

1165
01:06:20.801 --> 01:06:24.250
but a sunny place for shady people and all that.
But he,

1166
01:06:24.340 --> 01:06:26.650
he just Didas does public record request nonstop.

1167
01:06:26.651 --> 01:06:29.290
And so people start leaking stuff to him before he even request it.

1168
01:06:29.530 --> 01:06:32.180
And he got an email that this late,
this like,
uh,

1169
01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:36.250
this like third shift is overnight shift in little Haiti neighborhood that the

1170
01:06:36.251 --> 01:06:41.110
city of Miami polices arrest quota.
They actually had from,

1171
01:06:41.140 --> 01:06:42.790
from like the shift sergeant,

1172
01:06:42.940 --> 01:06:46.680
send out an email with quotas that included arrest quotas,

1173
01:06:46.690 --> 01:06:51.690
meaning that each officer had to arrest effectuating arrest for what he didn't

1174
01:06:52.241 --> 01:06:53.080
specify,
but,

1175
01:06:53.150 --> 01:06:57.840
and they had a minimum number of arrests they had to perform during a shift in

1176
01:06:58.210 --> 01:07:01.660
six.
Man,
what if you don't encounter anyone committing a crime?
Well,

1177
01:07:01.661 --> 01:07:06.250
that's what I,
he said,
what,
what happened in this country?
If the entire country,

1178
01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:09.760
if all 350 million people agreed,
okay,

1179
01:07:09.761 --> 01:07:11.290
even you fucking hardcore criminals,

1180
01:07:11.291 --> 01:07:14.560
no one's going to do anything wrong from month,
just one month

1181
01:07:16.810 --> 01:07:20.500
down the opposite of the purse for one month.
No one's going to speed.

1182
01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:23.260
No one's going to steal.
No one's gonna do anything wrong.

1183
01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:26.290
Just everyone abide by the law even.
I mean,
that's,

1184
01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:28.860
that's not outside the realm of possibility.
These things,

1185
01:07:28.930 --> 01:07:31.810
these departments would freak the fuck out.
They wouldn't know what to do.

1186
01:07:31.850 --> 01:07:34.940
They would have no revenue coming in.
I think about,
I think about,
you know,
what,

1187
01:07:34.941 --> 01:07:37.850
what Hitchin Zola rest in peace.
So He's used to say about,
you know,

1188
01:07:38.140 --> 01:07:39.040
the necessity of,

1189
01:07:39.070 --> 01:07:43.810
of religion to keep us from becoming savages or B,

1190
01:07:45.110 --> 01:07:50.050
we know right from wrong,
we have internal moral compass.
I said earlier,
I'm like,

1191
01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:53.680
God,
I wish I could be corrupted so I could make more money and you know,
and,

1192
01:07:53.681 --> 01:07:56.860
and take care of my family better,
but like,
but I can't do it.
I think,
you know,

1193
01:07:56.861 --> 01:07:59.110
every time I kind of like try to lay off,
I wish I,
you know,

1194
01:07:59.111 --> 01:08:02.050
of of just like what's right or wrong.
I get right back on Twitter and I'm like,

1195
01:08:02.260 --> 01:08:05.620
this shit's wrong and people need to know about it and like it's the same thing

1196
01:08:05.621 --> 01:08:07.480
there.
It's like without the 10 commandments,

1197
01:08:07.570 --> 01:08:11.500
would we just start raping and robbing and murdering and I don't think we would

1198
01:08:11.501 --> 01:08:15.100
do that as I think we all had,
it goes back to this,
this sense of self worth.

1199
01:08:15.110 --> 01:08:16.140
I think we all have by

1200
01:08:16.140 --> 01:08:19.100
<v 2>and large this the sense of self worth and preservation,</v>

1201
01:08:19.101 --> 01:08:22.430
which might very well be off the charts,
but I think actually creates,

1202
01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:25.070
makes us a little bit more civilized because it's like,
well,

1203
01:08:25.071 --> 01:08:27.620
I have too much to lose.
Maybe you know,

1204
01:08:27.621 --> 01:08:31.610
I'm not going to just rape rob and murder,
but I think you're right.

1205
01:08:31.611 --> 01:08:34.970
I think that's a bad way of addressing it in the first place like this.

1206
01:08:34.971 --> 01:08:37.940
I have too much to lose to do that.
No,
you don't want to hurt people.

1207
01:08:37.941 --> 01:08:41.150
It feels bad.
It feels bad to insult people.

1208
01:08:41.270 --> 01:08:44.210
One of the issues that we have with the Internet is that you know,

1209
01:08:44.211 --> 01:08:48.080
you have a real issue with people stalking,
harassing,

1210
01:08:48.081 --> 01:08:51.560
being trolling people,
being vicious to people.
Strangers too.

1211
01:08:51.561 --> 01:08:55.100
Like people didn't really know because there's no social consequences.

1212
01:08:55.101 --> 01:08:57.020
There's no,
you don't,
you don't feel it.

1213
01:08:57.170 --> 01:09:00.950
If you're looking at a person and he'd take a person and you show them a picture

1214
01:09:00.951 --> 01:09:03.410
of them with 15 diction around,
which by the way,

1215
01:09:03.411 --> 01:09:05.450
I'm not really talking about that cause that's usually pretty funny.

1216
01:09:05.690 --> 01:09:07.850
Like there's a lot of pictures of me with Dixon,
my mouth.

1217
01:09:07.851 --> 01:09:10.820
I've never once tried to take them off the Internet.
I think they're hilarious.

1218
01:09:11.090 --> 01:09:14.330
It doesn't bother me.
But for some people it's genuinely upsetting.

1219
01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:18.860
Especially women like that.
Find Pictures.
I'm good.
I'm Google tags too,
dude.

1220
01:09:18.861 --> 01:09:23.270
Believe me.
Go to my fucking message board.
There's a swarm of them.

1221
01:09:23.390 --> 01:09:26.560
I don't have a percent.
Is it got a swarm of Dixon as a gaggle lab?

1222
01:09:26.750 --> 01:09:30.680
It's a flock of dicks cauldron.
I Dunno.

1223
01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:34.160
I just think,
look,
there's the golden rule of the Internet.

1224
01:09:34.161 --> 01:09:35.870
If there's a photo of you and the Internet somewhere,

1225
01:09:35.871 --> 01:09:39.290
someone is Photoshop to dick in your mouth.
Just if they haven't,

1226
01:09:39.291 --> 01:09:41.780
it's just the boom knew about that photo yet.

1227
01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:46.670
I guarantee you by the end of this podcast there will be pictures of you in some

1228
01:09:46.671 --> 01:09:49.700
sort of a compromising position with when he said,
if I,
if I didn't have one,

1229
01:09:49.701 --> 01:09:52.610
I'd actually be offended.
I feel I feel worse about myself.
I'd be like,

1230
01:09:52.611 --> 01:09:54.680
no one's bothered to even Photoshop a dick in my mouth.

1231
01:09:54.710 --> 01:09:57.950
You reach a certain amount of photographs of you on the Internet.

1232
01:09:57.980 --> 01:10:01.070
It's ultimately inevitable if you're a public person,

1233
01:10:01.071 --> 01:10:03.810
you know if you are in oh and have it sounds good.

1234
01:10:03.820 --> 01:10:07.220
But Adam fairly edible at this point.
That's been proven,

1235
01:10:08.750 --> 01:10:12.530
but I think that you know that,
that that's more fun than anything.

1236
01:10:12.531 --> 01:10:15.120
But I think the shit you're talking,
yeah.
Hateful Shit.
Like,

1237
01:10:15.380 --> 01:10:20.090
I mean I've seen some really fucking evil harassment that some people have had

1238
01:10:20.091 --> 01:10:21.350
to suffer for whatever reason.

1239
01:10:21.351 --> 01:10:24.350
It seems to be more women than anything because with women they could use the

1240
01:10:24.351 --> 01:10:27.320
rape thing.
Like if a guy tells me he's going to rape me and my,
well,

1241
01:10:27.321 --> 01:10:30.470
good luck with that.
That's not going to happen unless you roofie me.

1242
01:10:30.470 --> 01:10:35.390
You're not raping me,
Dude.
You know,
no cost.
I mean,
you'd have to,
yeah,
this,

1243
01:10:35.420 --> 01:10:38.750
this,
this thing that we can do because of this,

1244
01:10:39.530 --> 01:10:43.190
this ability to interact with people with no social consequences.

1245
01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:47.240
It's a real issue.
Twitter gangsters,
I called them sad,
lonely Twitter trolls.

1246
01:10:47.241 --> 01:10:50.330
Facebook is a little bit better because with Facebook you can click on the

1247
01:10:50.331 --> 01:10:51.710
person's profile and you see,
oh,

1248
01:10:51.711 --> 01:10:56.570
this is like something like Jones from Baba blustery or some fucking day.

1249
01:10:56.910 --> 01:10:59.890
Yeah,
exactly.
Stupid handle and yeah,

1250
01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:04.430
I mean that does become a real issue with social interaction,

1251
01:11:04.431 --> 01:11:07.550
but I think it's a temporary hiccup.
I really do.

1252
01:11:07.580 --> 01:11:10.930
I think that this we're in as a stage of,

1253
01:11:10.970 --> 01:11:15.970
I'm also an adolescent stage of interactivity where what we're experiencing now

1254
01:11:16.231 --> 01:11:17.870
is,
is just,
it's a,

1255
01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:22.830
it's a weird like bridge between total connectivity.

1256
01:11:23.070 --> 01:11:23.231
I,

1257
01:11:23.231 --> 01:11:28.231
the complete absence of any form of privacy is on the way and it might be a

1258
01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:31.320
hundred years from now.
It might be 30 it might be in our lifetime,

1259
01:11:31.321 --> 01:11:32.850
it may be a couple months from now.

1260
01:11:32.851 --> 01:11:36.210
Somebody might come up with something and they'll say,
look,
this is going,

1261
01:11:36.211 --> 01:11:39.750
this one thing that we're going to implement is going to be unbelievable as far

1262
01:11:39.751 --> 01:11:42.660
as exchanging information.
As far as our knowledge base,

1263
01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:45.960
the actual Iq of human beings is going to double within weeks.

1264
01:11:46.110 --> 01:11:49.110
We're going to change the world,
but no more privacy.

1265
01:11:49.380 --> 01:11:54.120
I mean we're in like the learning curve.
It's going to happen.
We are essentially,

1266
01:11:54.150 --> 01:11:56.400
we were driving around and model A's,

1267
01:11:56.640 --> 01:12:01.200
but one day someone's going to invent a fucking nine 11 gt three and you know,

1268
01:12:01.201 --> 01:12:05.130
if you went back and took time when Henry Ford's driving around his stupid

1269
01:12:05.131 --> 01:12:06.330
fucking shitty car,

1270
01:12:06.570 --> 01:12:10.920
you know Brian and you pulled up beside him in a Mustang,

1271
01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:15.300
Shelby gt 500 and go check this shit out.
I'm from the future.
Oh boy.

1272
01:12:17.030 --> 01:12:21.230
He'd be like,
what the fuck is that dude?
I'm 660 waiting on the hoverboard.

1273
01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:22.590
I'm still waiting on the hoverboard.

1274
01:12:22.950 --> 01:12:25.680
But if you have like a hover board is just you just floating,

1275
01:12:25.681 --> 01:12:29.220
what's the big deal?
It's just not touching anything.
Whoa.
It's so crazy.

1276
01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:32.370
We have jets that go faster than the speed of sound.
I mean,

1277
01:12:32.371 --> 01:12:36.690
that's the hoverboards dog shit.
Ooh.
Can Float so it can a plain stupid.

1278
01:12:36.750 --> 01:12:39.400
I just don't get how much the world has changed.
We're,
we're,

1279
01:12:39.410 --> 01:12:43.860
we're working at a doc about,
uh,
about nine 11 right now.
And,
and it's,
it's like,

1280
01:12:44.370 --> 01:12:45.600
it's been like 14 years,

1281
01:12:46.710 --> 01:12:49.560
which is incredible because it seems like such a modern history of Virginia is

1282
01:12:49.710 --> 01:12:50.880
of course a modern historical event.

1283
01:12:50.881 --> 01:12:54.090
But it seems like just yesterday and when you consider how much the world has

1284
01:12:54.091 --> 01:12:58.110
changed,
particularly tech technologically,
there was no Twitter,
no Instagram.

1285
01:12:58.140 --> 01:13:02.000
There was no,
you know,
there was,
uh,
there was barely youtube at that point,

1286
01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:05.290
you know?
Uh,
so I think youtube actually know him.
You know,
it wasn't,
no.

1287
01:13:05.291 --> 01:13:09.750
Youtube was like Chuck [inaudible] 2003 or 2004.
There was like Napster and 99.

1288
01:13:09.751 --> 01:13:12.720
But now you've just think of how far we've come.
I think you're right.

1289
01:13:12.721 --> 01:13:16.830
This is just the infancy of of era.
Yeah.

1290
01:13:17.170 --> 01:13:18.300
And I think um,

1291
01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:21.960
like what you're talking about on your website where all these people were

1292
01:13:21.961 --> 01:13:23.430
getting upset and you know the,

1293
01:13:23.431 --> 01:13:26.970
the Trayvon Martin thing and people are interacting and his racism and all this,

1294
01:13:27.510 --> 01:13:31.740
all that stuff I think is a byproduct of this.

1295
01:13:31.970 --> 01:13:36.030
The monkey DNA that we still carry around in our bodies.

1296
01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:40.170
And I think we're on our way to transcending that and some very strange way

1297
01:13:40.350 --> 01:13:43.140
where it's not going to matter what part of the world you're from.

1298
01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:45.390
It's not going to matter.
It's all that.

1299
01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:47.580
One of the things we've seen like these people getting yup.

1300
01:13:47.910 --> 01:13:50.700
Cause people getting married in Alabama,
he's,
you know the,

1301
01:13:50.701 --> 01:13:55.701
the way though the world is changing that I believe is 100% because of the

1302
01:13:55.861 --> 01:13:58.350
Internet.
I believe that wholeheartedly.

1303
01:13:58.530 --> 01:14:02.100
And that's one of the things that encourages me.
And I feel like this trend,

1304
01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:06.270
like today,
like no one could try to bring back slavery today,

1305
01:14:06.570 --> 01:14:10.830
but in 1870 1865,
1860,
these were real,

1306
01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:14.170
these are real arguments where people were saying we should be able to keep

1307
01:14:14.171 --> 01:14:18.670
slaves.
That's a fucking blink of an eye,
man.
That is not that long ago.

1308
01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:23.440
You're talking about 150 years at,
that ain't shit.
That's not shit historically.

1309
01:14:23.590 --> 01:14:24.610
I mean,
that's so cool.

1310
01:14:24.820 --> 01:14:29.470
So recent and more so now than ever before.

1311
01:14:29.471 --> 01:14:33.250
More so within the last few years than ever before.
And you know,

1312
01:14:33.251 --> 01:14:36.910
you've seen ridiculous things.
I would like the social justice warriors,

1313
01:14:37.060 --> 01:14:41.140
these really weird white people that are trying so hard to get black people,

1314
01:14:41.141 --> 01:14:41.741
to love them,

1315
01:14:41.741 --> 01:14:46.510
that they just go out of their way to just be outrageously progressive to the

1316
01:14:46.511 --> 01:14:50.200
point where they're actually prejudice against other white people.
They're like,

1317
01:14:50.201 --> 01:14:53.290
they go so far left to become right.
You know,
I mean,

1318
01:14:53.291 --> 01:14:58.291
I've seen some ridiculous shit where I saw this one guy who was quoting about

1319
01:14:58.751 --> 01:15:01.260
Osama bin Ladin saying that,
um,

1320
01:15:01.300 --> 01:15:05.800
I will never a celebrate someone's death.
Uh,
you know,

1321
01:15:05.801 --> 01:15:08.260
even if they were a horrible person,
you know,

1322
01:15:08.290 --> 01:15:13.240
and then the same guy quoted about Christopher Hitchens,
you know,
good riddance.

1323
01:15:13.330 --> 01:15:18.090
He was a misogynist and a warmonger like,
okay,
fuck head.
He's like,
I can't,

1324
01:15:18.100 --> 01:15:20.320
can't have it both ways,
but what he is,

1325
01:15:20.321 --> 01:15:23.440
is the Uber version of the social justice warrior,

1326
01:15:23.441 --> 01:15:28.441
the unfuckable white dude trying so hard to get women and black people to love

1327
01:15:28.871 --> 01:15:33.700
him because he just is completely insubstantial in any real form in our,
and our,

1328
01:15:33.730 --> 01:15:37.770
the,
the,
the,
the,
the normal context of our culture.
I find the more,
you know,

1329
01:15:37.790 --> 01:15:41.530
the thinking about race so much,
it's kind of racist.

1330
01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:44.680
So like the more kind of progressive you get about these issues,

1331
01:15:44.681 --> 01:15:47.110
the more you're thinking about sensitivity and the more,

1332
01:15:47.230 --> 01:15:51.910
I think that's an overcorrection to say the least.
You know,
I w we,

1333
01:15:51.940 --> 01:15:56.350
um,
like black Annie Black Annie,
they're doing black uncle buck.

1334
01:15:56.890 --> 01:16:01.750
Did you know that?
I just wanted to bang my head.
They don't have to do that.
That,

1335
01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:04.660
that trend that like what is that?
Like the late nineties,

1336
01:16:04.661 --> 01:16:08.520
early Zeros when like hip hop was peaking,
they did a black,

1337
01:16:08.530 --> 01:16:09.810
there was the black honeymooners.
I never,

1338
01:16:09.870 --> 01:16:11.890
there was a black airplane with soap sold.

1339
01:16:12.580 --> 01:16:16.090
So that trend is like coming back around again.
Like we have to do that,

1340
01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:20.160
we have to do the black version of like all of these like pop culture they

1341
01:16:20.180 --> 01:16:22.510
touched down.
So this is,
it's demeaning,

1342
01:16:22.540 --> 01:16:25.510
it's demeaning to black people to do that.
And first of all,
soul plane.

1343
01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:29.770
I know the guy who created it,
White Guy Nitel,
that opportunist kind of a con.

1344
01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:36.240
It's just what's going on is people are taking advantage of this opportunity to

1345
01:16:37.100 --> 01:16:41.560
like to,
to capitalize on a market.
Cultural,
ultra vultures culture vultures.

1346
01:16:41.740 --> 01:16:43.900
Great way of looking at it.
Last year,
early last year,

1347
01:16:43.901 --> 01:16:47.770
we did a mini series for VH ones,
rock docs series.

1348
01:16:47.771 --> 01:16:50.030
I think it might've been their,
one of their last rock docs ever,
um,

1349
01:16:50.620 --> 01:16:53.080
called the tanning of America at one nation under hip hop.

1350
01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:57.640
And so it panic the tanning of America,
one nation under hip hop,

1351
01:16:57.641 --> 01:17:01.390
as long as there's no black face vogue.
And it was written,

1352
01:17:01.391 --> 01:17:04.150
it was a book called the Tanning America written by a guy named Steve Stout who

1353
01:17:04.151 --> 01:17:05.740
was,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,

1354
01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:10.000
major duty guy in the record business and is now a big in the Mar,

1355
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:11.360
<v 3>our marketing and advertising world.</v>

1356
01:17:11.361 --> 01:17:16.361
And His thesis was that hip hop culture led to the election of the first black

1357
01:17:17.751 --> 01:17:18.584
president.

1358
01:17:18.770 --> 01:17:23.240
The idea that a generation of Americans that grew up immersed with the music,

1359
01:17:23.540 --> 01:17:24.373
the fashion,

1360
01:17:24.410 --> 01:17:29.410
how it infiltrated the Wall Street Madison Avenue in the consumer goods,

1361
01:17:30.890 --> 01:17:35.070
uh,
a sector.
And we just grew up immersed in this culture.
Uh,

1362
01:17:35.071 --> 01:17:39.530
it tanned the mental complexion of Americans and made it okay or even cool to

1363
01:17:39.531 --> 01:17:42.080
vote for,
uh,
the first black president.

1364
01:17:42.260 --> 01:17:45.710
And so we had four hours to kind of prove this,
this thesis.

1365
01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:50.060
And we go to Sundance last year,
um,

1366
01:17:50.570 --> 01:17:54.230
I think it was actually the venue was called the black house.
Um,

1367
01:17:54.410 --> 01:17:58.450
and it was an event that sort of celebrated the African American cinema and

1368
01:17:58.451 --> 01:17:59.810
culture that was going on at Sundance.

1369
01:17:59.811 --> 01:18:02.330
And so we're going to do like this panel discussion because the movie wasn't

1370
01:18:02.331 --> 01:18:05.300
done yet and we're going there.

1371
01:18:05.300 --> 01:18:07.480
And someone said to me for the first time,

1372
01:18:07.481 --> 01:18:10.250
you've been working on this project for almost two years or a year and a half.

1373
01:18:10.790 --> 01:18:14.000
And someone said to me for the first time,
like particularly,

1374
01:18:14.001 --> 01:18:18.140
I guess they were concerned about that environment,
uh,
the black,
the black house,

1375
01:18:18.141 --> 01:18:20.540
which turned out to be a fantastic experience.
But they said,
well,

1376
01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:25.610
what if somebody says like,
well,
why are you guys doing it?
You know,

1377
01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:29.570
you to like white Jewish dudes from,
from Miami.
Why,
why,

1378
01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:33.410
why are you guys doing this documentary?
And I was like,

1379
01:18:33.530 --> 01:18:36.530
and the thought had never crossed my mind.
Like,
I didn't even think about that.

1380
01:18:36.531 --> 01:18:40.790
Like,
why would this think about great story,
great idea,
great concept,

1381
01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:45.230
a challenge to kind of prove that,
which is what you do,
you cover historically.

1382
01:18:45.260 --> 01:18:47.030
And I never thought.
And then,
and then I sort of,

1383
01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:49.210
and then I started thinking about it and I'm like,
well,

1384
01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:52.600
why am I even thinking about this?
Like,
and,

1385
01:18:52.650 --> 01:18:55.040
and like someone put it in Yoga and my head with it and,

1386
01:18:55.050 --> 01:18:57.890
and white privilege and white privilege.

1387
01:18:57.891 --> 01:19:01.620
And then I started getting white guilt about it.
White male privilege.
She's like,

1388
01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:04.130
Oh shit,
have white guilt.
And I started feeling like,
well wait,

1389
01:19:04.131 --> 01:19:06.650
is it white male privilege that I never thought about this before?

1390
01:19:06.651 --> 01:19:10.400
Course I was like,
Oh shit.
Course it is shame.
I know.
Shame on you.

1391
01:19:11.590 --> 01:19:14.330
I was really in my head about this hunks upon you.
And I'm like,

1392
01:19:14.331 --> 01:19:17.960
and what if somebody else brings it up like publicly or asks me about it or what

1393
01:19:17.961 --> 01:19:21.650
the hell am I going to say or do rocks?
And I,
and I,
and I thought about it,

1394
01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:22.970
I thought about it for literally,

1395
01:19:22.971 --> 01:19:26.840
that entire thing happened in like a millisecond.
And then I'm like,
well,

1396
01:19:26.841 --> 01:19:27.674
first of all,

1397
01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:30.473
<v 4>uh,</v>

1398
01:19:30.980 --> 01:19:32.570
<v 3>we are that generation.</v>

1399
01:19:33.020 --> 01:19:36.830
I thought about my childhood in living color was my SNL.

1400
01:19:37.370 --> 01:19:41.360
Arcenio Cineo was my Johnny Carson.
I grew up a white,
white Jewish kid.

1401
01:19:41.660 --> 01:19:46.010
I watched two to seven.
I watch the Cosby show.
A different world.

1402
01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:51.110
Amen.
You remember the show?
Amen.
Am I watching?
Amen.
Was Amen.
Amen.

1403
01:19:51.260 --> 01:19:54.890
What Deacon for you?
Remember that it took place at like a black church with,
um,

1404
01:19:54.891 --> 01:19:59.000
with,
what's his name?
George Jefferson was like,
it was like,
it was,
it was,

1405
01:19:59.060 --> 01:20:02.000
it was a great show.
But what the hell am I watching it for?
But I loved it.

1406
01:20:02.180 --> 01:20:06.550
I didn't think about,
I looked at Sanford and son CSeries fucking shows time.

1407
01:20:07.020 --> 01:20:10.890
Norman Lear,
a little white Jewish guy like me.

1408
01:20:11.130 --> 01:20:15.900
It was responsible for,
for the first all black sitcoms on television,

1409
01:20:16.130 --> 01:20:20.640
a Sanford and son,
the Jeffersons,
good times.
Um,
all in the family,

1410
01:20:20.641 --> 01:20:24.330
which really brought the discussion of race to tell it to mainstream television

1411
01:20:24.390 --> 01:20:28.500
in the way standup comics were doing it,
obviously well before that,
but,
but said,

1412
01:20:28.501 --> 01:20:31.170
we're going to go on network television and have serious conversations about

1413
01:20:31.290 --> 01:20:35.340
politics and race and poverty in this country.
White Jewish guy.

1414
01:20:35.430 --> 01:20:39.450
And then you'll look at Russell Russell Simmons teams up with Rick Rubin,

1415
01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:43.830
a white Jewish guy.
Uh,
at Nyu.
Um,
you look at all,
you know,

1416
01:20:43.831 --> 01:20:46.540
in all of these sort of relationships that helped,
uh,
you know,

1417
01:20:46.620 --> 01:20:47.610
we interviewed Brett Ratner,

1418
01:20:47.670 --> 01:20:52.170
White Jewish kid from Miami beach who was loved hip hop because hip hop wasn't,

1419
01:20:52.890 --> 01:20:56.100
it was,
it wasn't just urban music,
it was youth culture,
music.

1420
01:20:56.101 --> 01:20:57.960
And that's why capture the generation of,
you know,

1421
01:20:58.020 --> 01:21:00.780
kids who didn't want to listen to what their parents were listening to,
you know,

1422
01:21:00.890 --> 01:21:02.520
and it wasn't rock and roll anymore.

1423
01:21:02.521 --> 01:21:04.740
It became hip hopper or rap music at the time.

1424
01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:07.140
And the second thing was Steve Stout,
to his credit,

1425
01:21:08.490 --> 01:21:12.270
when we walked in the room to meet with him,
he didn't know we were white.

1426
01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:15.090
He knew we did cocaine cowboys.
He knew we did the you,

1427
01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:18.630
he knew the work and he respected and liked the work.
So he's like,
oh,

1428
01:21:18.631 --> 01:21:21.600
I want to work with those guys who did this shit that I like and respect.

1429
01:21:21.660 --> 01:21:24.360
It was like,
oh wait,
they're white.
So to his credit,

1430
01:21:24.390 --> 01:21:26.460
he never thought about it either.
So it's like,

1431
01:21:26.461 --> 01:21:28.290
why should I start thinking about it?

1432
01:21:28.350 --> 01:21:30.090
I'm dealing with the same thing right now with dog fight.

1433
01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:35.210
That's what I'm dealing with.
To these folks.
Explain,
uh,

1434
01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:39.960
your,
your new project first.
I got to spell it.
Yeah.
It's Ea Wg,
Michael Vick,

1435
01:21:40.530 --> 01:21:44.820
dog fight.
It's not like a pit bulls.
It's done.
It's not,

1436
01:21:44.821 --> 01:21:48.420
it's it's dog fight.
Well,
the underground culture in Miami,

1437
01:21:48.421 --> 01:21:51.250
there's a been a like a street fighting culture.

1438
01:21:51.350 --> 01:21:53.820
Well this was the subculture that,
that real look,

1439
01:21:53.850 --> 01:21:56.630
I'd say Kimbo slice was kind of responsible for it anymore.

1440
01:21:57.270 --> 01:21:59.610
He became the,
uh,
you know,

1441
01:21:59.611 --> 01:22:04.470
the role model for a new generation of young people in Miami to literally try to

1442
01:22:04.471 --> 01:22:08.010
fight their way to a better life.
And there's this neighborhood,
which is right,

1443
01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:11.970
right where Kimbo came from and would fight in the backyards called West Brine.

1444
01:22:12.180 --> 01:22:16.830
So this is 22 miles southwest of South beach.
So when you think Miami,

1445
01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:19.980
you,
most people default,
like I said,
but you know,
to ocean drive,

1446
01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:22.230
this is 22 miles southwest of that.

1447
01:22:22.410 --> 01:22:24.660
This is an area that I call a suburban ghetto.

1448
01:22:24.890 --> 01:22:27.690
And I say that because when you think of ghetto or an urban neighborhood,

1449
01:22:27.930 --> 01:22:32.730
you think of,
um,
you think of vertical,
you know,
people stacked in projects,

1450
01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:35.130
you know,
now,
you know,
on top of each other,
next to each other.

1451
01:22:35.340 --> 01:22:39.590
But purline as these very modest houses in like a,
on a,

1452
01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:43.320
on a pretty reasonably sized lot.
So you have a little house and you'll have a,

1453
01:22:43.330 --> 01:22:47.550
a nice size yard.
And so Dada,
$5,000 a year.
Harris,

1454
01:22:47.551 --> 01:22:50.310
he's this guy who actually,
there's a video of him,

1455
01:22:50.311 --> 01:22:53.880
a youtube video that we use in the movie of him benching in his mom's yard there

1456
01:22:53.881 --> 01:22:57.330
and pride,
650 pounds.
He benches,
um,

1457
01:22:57.780 --> 01:22:59.790
and he's benching,

1458
01:22:59.850 --> 01:23:03.540
but he's bench pressing and team Kimbo comes rolling by and sees this guy,

1459
01:23:03.570 --> 01:23:06.790
this beast.
And he's like,
I'm to fight ray Mercer in Atlantic city.

1460
01:23:06.850 --> 01:23:09.280
Why don't you roll with us?
So for a year,
dot.

1461
01:23:09.281 --> 01:23:13.650
I's on the fucking jet,
you know,
going around the world with,
with,

1462
01:23:13.740 --> 01:23:14.580
<v 2>with team Kimbo.</v>

1463
01:23:14.850 --> 01:23:18.690
Kimbo was very slick in that fight with Ray Mercer who is very smart,

1464
01:23:18.860 --> 01:23:21.180
caught him in a fucking good team.
He's like,
listen bitch,

1465
01:23:21.181 --> 01:23:24.330
I learned some new shit.
I ain't standing up with you.

1466
01:23:24.540 --> 01:23:29.240
A Olympic gold medalist world heavyweight boxing champion.
Fuck you.

1467
01:23:29.580 --> 01:23:33.210
I'm going to fucking choke your neck and Kimbo like when he did that,

1468
01:23:33.211 --> 01:23:35.790
like Ray Mercer was pissed off.

1469
01:23:36.540 --> 01:23:38.610
You saw the ray Mercer fight with Tim Sylvia.

1470
01:23:38.611 --> 01:23:43.350
Just see that finally God Damn Ray Mercer,
he hit Tim Sylvia with a punch to it.

1471
01:23:43.351 --> 01:23:47.520
Probably took a year and a half off his life.
I mean one punch,

1472
01:23:47.550 --> 01:23:52.290
he KOD him.
It's terrible.
He k owed him so viciously with this one punch.

1473
01:23:52.291 --> 01:23:57.291
I mean he was one within the first 1520 seconds of the fight cause hit him flush

1474
01:23:57.451 --> 01:23:59.550
on the Chin and knocked him dead.

1475
01:23:59.551 --> 01:24:02.280
So you're seeing that in a legal sanction environment where they were,

1476
01:24:02.281 --> 01:24:04.050
the fighters had had checkups,

1477
01:24:04.051 --> 01:24:06.150
they were waiting and there's a doctorate ambulance.

1478
01:24:06.350 --> 01:24:09.700
Why these are like on Indian reservations that stuff.

1479
01:24:09.750 --> 01:24:12.930
Well imagine it in a fucking backyard.
Oh Dude,
I've seen a law.

1480
01:24:13.090 --> 01:24:15.990
He Seen Alex because Sarah's who fights for the UFC right now.

1481
01:24:15.991 --> 01:24:18.920
He got his start doing that shit.
So did Jorge Mas Dahl,

1482
01:24:18.930 --> 01:24:23.700
who's a high level fighter in the UFC mosfet doll fought a lot of those fights.

1483
01:24:23.780 --> 01:24:25.830
Well that,
that's like,
to me like the origin story,

1484
01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:28.200
that's the goal for these guys.
You have a neighborhood that is,

1485
01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:33.220
<v 3>um,
you know,
over a third black,
uh,
that's majority,
uh,</v>

1486
01:24:33.221 --> 01:24:37.250
of the,
of the community is bill,
you know,
below the poverty level.
Um,

1487
01:24:37.330 --> 01:24:40.360
what employment is like a third higher than the national average.

1488
01:24:40.630 --> 01:24:44.110
And you basically have a community with very little hope and very little

1489
01:24:44.111 --> 01:24:47.920
opportunity.
You know,
you've criminalized a vast majority of the male population,

1490
01:24:47.921 --> 01:24:48.430
so they're not,

1491
01:24:48.430 --> 01:24:52.720
they can't get work and they think that their best hope is to fight in these

1492
01:24:52.721 --> 01:24:56.170
illegal unsanctioned bare knuckle backyard brawls,

1493
01:24:56.560 --> 01:25:00.460
upload the footage to youtube and hopefully get discovered by a professional and

1494
01:25:00.461 --> 01:25:03.700
then a promoter or trainer and,
and try to go pro.

1495
01:25:03.850 --> 01:25:07.750
<v 2>Look at Kimbo Kimbo slice has made millions of dollars.</v>

1496
01:25:07.751 --> 01:25:10.450
The guy that he's done that Horatio Alger story that,
that,

1497
01:25:10.451 --> 01:25:13.580
that they aspire to be and he recently got signed for Bellator.

1498
01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:17.260
He's going to fight again until this Kimbo.
Um,
it's a good question.

1499
01:25:17.261 --> 01:25:20.200
I would say he's probably in his forties now.
You know,
uh,

1500
01:25:20.201 --> 01:25:21.640
when he fought for the ultimate fighter,

1501
01:25:21.641 --> 01:25:25.810
I think he was like in his late thirties,
let's say Kimbo slice data.

1502
01:25:26.020 --> 01:25:30.310
So they blew up team Kimbo blew up a fighter named level level Martinez 31 41.

1503
01:25:30.311 --> 01:25:31.330
Wow.
Um,

1504
01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:35.930
I'm thinking that's old in the way in the world and the average age of heavy

1505
01:25:35.931 --> 01:25:40.720
weights tend to age uh,
better.
Um,
but uh,

1506
01:25:40.721 --> 01:25:43.450
he fought at two oh five,
I believe in the UFC.

1507
01:25:45.010 --> 01:25:48.310
I think there's something going on with heavyweights where your body takes

1508
01:25:48.311 --> 01:25:52.840
longer to learn how to move all that mass.
If I had a look at it that way,

1509
01:25:53.020 --> 01:25:57.370
lighter weight fighters also rely much more on speed and reflexes.

1510
01:25:57.580 --> 01:25:59.020
I think as you get larger,

1511
01:25:59.110 --> 01:26:04.110
you tend to rely more on skills and more on just sort of an understanding of

1512
01:26:05.271 --> 01:26:09.800
what your body can and can't do.
They can't have smaller gas tanks is undeniably,

1513
01:26:10.110 --> 01:26:11.720
there's no way a heavyweight,

1514
01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:15.170
unless you Cain Velasquez who's a really a fucking freak of nature,

1515
01:26:15.500 --> 01:26:18.680
can fight at the same sort of a pace that a lighter weight guy can.

1516
01:26:18.970 --> 01:26:21.200
So the thing that UFC heavyweight champion,
Cain Velasquez,

1517
01:26:21.201 --> 01:26:24.710
one of the most unique athletes I've ever seen,
he's lends itself to longevity.

1518
01:26:24.711 --> 01:26:27.440
I mean,
you just sorta like go at him in his case,
no,

1519
01:26:27.441 --> 01:26:29.010
because he's all fucked up can't,

1520
01:26:29.060 --> 01:26:33.380
I mean Kane who was an amazing fighter and one of the,

1521
01:26:33.620 --> 01:26:36.050
I think he might is a good argument.

1522
01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:39.920
He might be the best heavyweight of all time,
but he's body keeps breaking.

1523
01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:42.030
He keeps blowing out knees and shoulders.
He's,

1524
01:26:42.031 --> 01:26:46.340
because he's so mentally tough and he's so driven and focused and so intense and

1525
01:26:46.341 --> 01:26:50.690
dedicated that he pushes through injuries and you can't fucking do that.

1526
01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:53.600
You know,
when you push through injuries,
what happens is they just break further.

1527
01:26:53.780 --> 01:26:56.930
You know?
I mean,
you can't push through a knee injury.
You what you're doing is,

1528
01:26:57.170 --> 01:26:58.920
yeah,
you got to get surgery or are you got to heal?

1529
01:26:58.930 --> 01:27:02.390
You've got to figure out a way to recuperate the scenario or,
or,

1530
01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:06.080
or alter your training so that you,
you know,
this doesn't happen in the future,

1531
01:27:06.081 --> 01:27:08.630
but they're all just so fucking tough man.

1532
01:27:08.631 --> 01:27:12.170
Which is what made them great wrestlers in the first place and would allow them

1533
01:27:12.171 --> 01:27:13.640
to transition into MMA.

1534
01:27:13.940 --> 01:27:17.540
But Cain has this insane gas tank where he just doesn't get fucking tired.

1535
01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:20.540
He just overwhelms guys because he's just,

1536
01:27:20.570 --> 01:27:25.310
he's got so much fucking cardio and a lot of it is probably natural,

1537
01:27:25.430 --> 01:27:27.470
like his,
just his body.
It's different.

1538
01:27:27.471 --> 01:27:30.470
People have different like natural vo two Max is,
it's just,

1539
01:27:30.740 --> 01:27:34.010
it's one of those things like some people have more fast twitch,
muscle fiber.

1540
01:27:34.100 --> 01:27:37.310
Some people have thicker bones,
some people have more.
They can just,

1541
01:27:37.790 --> 01:27:41.480
especially for some reason it seems like Mexicans in particular have very good

1542
01:27:41.481 --> 01:27:43.980
cardio.
It's really common,
you know that,

1543
01:27:44.100 --> 01:27:48.350
I mean it could conceivably be that a lot of Mexican folks come from really

1544
01:27:48.351 --> 01:27:52.820
hardworking environments and they've been forced to work like labor jobs.

1545
01:27:52.821 --> 01:27:53.451
Like a lot of them,

1546
01:27:53.451 --> 01:27:58.340
especially second third generation whose parents had an arduous trek to get over

1547
01:27:58.341 --> 01:28:01.010
here from Mexico.
You know,
it could be mental,

1548
01:28:01.011 --> 01:28:05.060
it could be just more mentally tough or it could be some physiological aspect.

1549
01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:10.310
But my point is that like,
he's a rarity in that his gas tank is just insane.

1550
01:28:10.460 --> 01:28:11.930
Most heavyweights,
as they get older,

1551
01:28:11.931 --> 01:28:16.430
they kind of learn how to pace themselves better.
They learn their skills,

1552
01:28:16.431 --> 01:28:19.970
they learn how to be more efficient with their movement.
Like Vladimir Klitschko,

1553
01:28:20.090 --> 01:28:24.530
who is just unstoppable as the heavyweight champion in boxing,
I believe.

1554
01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:26.750
I want to say he's 39 years old,

1555
01:28:27.230 --> 01:28:31.190
which is it mean he's coming into his own now.
I mean,
when he was younger,

1556
01:28:31.310 --> 01:28:34.910
he went to a streak where he got stopped,
I think two fights in a row.

1557
01:28:34.911 --> 01:28:38.810
He got Kod and you know,
wasn't,
wasn't,
wasn't looking good for him.

1558
01:28:39.020 --> 01:28:43.310
And now he's like,
you know,
all these years later,
he's like unstoppable.
Yeah.

1559
01:28:43.311 --> 01:28:46.880
He's,
um,
he's 38 right now and he's,
you know,

1560
01:28:46.881 --> 01:28:48.560
he hasn't lost like 10 fucking years.

1561
01:28:48.950 --> 01:28:50.840
I'm kind of fascinated by this because I'm just getting into it now.

1562
01:28:50.841 --> 01:28:55.130
I spent almost two years following this and several years in post trying to find

1563
01:28:55.131 --> 01:28:58.130
a way to get done.
Release is almost done.
We're scoring it now.

1564
01:28:58.131 --> 01:29:02.620
It's coming out March 12th.
And will it be in the film a dog-fi.com

1565
01:29:02.620 --> 01:29:07.290
<v 1>da wg-fight.com or if he,
if that's tough to remember.
Cocaine cowboys.com we'll,</v>

1566
01:29:07.291 --> 01:29:09.580
we'll,
we'll,
we'll eventually,
we'll eventually get you there.
You'll,

1567
01:29:09.581 --> 01:29:14.220
you can click through.
Yeah.
But um,
uh,
we,
uh,
it's going to be online.

1568
01:29:14.370 --> 01:29:16.620
It's going to be online.
You're gonna be able to get it there at the site.

1569
01:29:16.710 --> 01:29:19.950
Like what will it be on Netflix will be eventually.
Absolutely.
Yeah.
Yeah.
TV.
Oh,

1570
01:29:19.960 --> 01:29:21.780
absolutely.
Eventually,
eventually everywhere.

1571
01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:23.570
I'm hoping to eventually get it on showtime.
We've had,

1572
01:29:23.610 --> 01:29:26.360
we've had a great run with the cocaine cowboys movies and some of our men are

1573
01:29:26.361 --> 01:29:30.520
their docs on showtime.
So good cooking cowboys there.

1574
01:29:30.580 --> 01:29:34.510
The critic at the Miami Herald saw a rough cut cause we're [inaudible] that
shit.

1575
01:29:34.520 --> 01:29:38.910
No,
no.
They didn't know the movie critic who's a great guy by the way.

1576
01:29:38.911 --> 01:29:41.750
Renee Rodriguez.
I love her name.
He saw a rough cut.
Renee,

1577
01:29:41.790 --> 01:29:45.240
he saw a rough cut and he said it's our best movie dog fight.
Whoa.

1578
01:29:45.330 --> 01:29:47.200
And strong words.

1579
01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:52.110
Cocaine cowboys one was amazing cocaine cowboys to might've even been better.

1580
01:29:52.230 --> 01:29:56.130
Really might've been better said.
No one ever said me.

1581
01:29:56.580 --> 01:29:58.900
Grizelda God damn,
that bitch is terrible.

1582
01:29:59.100 --> 01:30:01.480
Whenever I hear about people like doing shit for money or for a paycheck,

1583
01:30:01.500 --> 01:30:05.460
I was just like,
listen,
I did cocaine cowboys to hustling with the godmother.

1584
01:30:05.610 --> 01:30:09.720
I directed a movie called cocaine cowboys to hustling.
Not even hustling,

1585
01:30:09.870 --> 01:30:13.770
hustling with an apostrophe at the end of it with the God that's in my

1586
01:30:13.771 --> 01:30:18.430
filmography.
Thank you.
You're very kind.
You're not kind.
I fucking do.

1587
01:30:18.431 --> 01:30:22.350
You do not like the second one as much as the first one.
I don't really.
Yeah,

1588
01:30:22.351 --> 01:30:26.100
I mean,
if I'm ranking for,
you know,
I always say movies,
movies are like kids.
You,

1589
01:30:26.110 --> 01:30:29.220
when people say,
do you have a favorite?
Yeah,
but I'm not going to tell you.

1590
01:30:29.430 --> 01:30:32.250
You know,
like that's the same thing with kids.
It's like every parent,

1591
01:30:32.460 --> 01:30:34.950
I don't care,
give a shit what they say.
I love them all equally.

1592
01:30:35.100 --> 01:30:39.720
No you don't because some kids are just assholes.
You can't possibly,
you know,

1593
01:30:39.770 --> 01:30:43.470
and,
and some of them are screw ups in life and my children,
no,
I got it.
Yeah.

1594
01:30:43.530 --> 01:30:48.480
You can kind of love them all equally because I think when kids like them all

1595
01:30:48.481 --> 01:30:51.510
equally,
it's Kinda of,
there's a part of it that's your fault.

1596
01:30:52.170 --> 01:30:55.950
That's the thing that you feel guilty,
you're saying guilds compensates for,

1597
01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:56.820
for the [inaudible],

1598
01:30:56.820 --> 01:31:00.450
for the lighter raises the love because you feel that they need more love

1599
01:31:00.451 --> 01:31:04.190
because you screwed them up.
You're responsible for their being dog.

1600
01:31:04.260 --> 01:31:08.460
That killed one of my other dogs.
I love the dog that she killed,

1601
01:31:08.550 --> 01:31:11.730
but I loved her just as much and it was very sad.
I mean,

1602
01:31:11.790 --> 01:31:16.200
obviously I should have loved the dog that got killed more cause she wasn't a

1603
01:31:16.201 --> 01:31:19.710
cunt.
She wasn't an asshole.
That was,
you know,
out there killing the other dogs.

1604
01:31:20.010 --> 01:31:20.491
But this,

1605
01:31:20.491 --> 01:31:23.520
this dog was a sweetie and I picked her up at the pound and she lived at the

1606
01:31:23.521 --> 01:31:26.280
pound.
She was in one of those no kill shelters for like eight months.

1607
01:31:26.281 --> 01:31:30.360
And when I was young,
man,
I had a real problem in that.
Um,

1608
01:31:31.380 --> 01:31:34.050
it's hard to talk about I guess,
um,

1609
01:31:35.730 --> 01:31:39.500
where I felt like,
um,
I felt I always had this,
uh,

1610
01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:41.790
this need to help strays.

1611
01:31:42.150 --> 01:31:47.150
And I think I had this need to help strays because I felt like a stray and when

1612
01:31:47.191 --> 01:31:50.190
I would see a a dog in a pound or a clicker,

1613
01:31:50.220 --> 01:31:54.000
I bought a cat from a fucking pet store cause it hissed at me,
you know,

1614
01:31:54.001 --> 01:31:56.350
cause I felt his poor fucking cat like scared of me.

1615
01:31:56.580 --> 01:31:59.490
You don't have to scared of me.
I love you.
And uh,

1616
01:32:00.430 --> 01:32:02.650
<v 2>I felt that way about this dog,
this poor Dar.</v>

1617
01:32:02.651 --> 01:32:05.170
I used to call it a squeaky cause uh,
when I picked her up,

1618
01:32:05.230 --> 01:32:08.710
she couldn't even talk.
She couldn't bark because she had barked so much,

1619
01:32:08.711 --> 01:32:11.080
so often in this pound that have her voice was gone.

1620
01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:13.300
So when she was barking in the pound,
she'd be like,
Yeah

1621
01:32:14.930 --> 01:32:15.340
<v 3>Huh.</v>

1622
01:32:15.340 --> 01:32:17.500
<v 2>It was like this squeaky noise.
And I was like,</v>

1623
01:32:17.501 --> 01:32:19.750
what the fuck is wrong with her voice?
And I realized,
Oh my God,

1624
01:32:19.751 --> 01:32:22.720
she's barking all day and she doesn't have a voice anymore.

1625
01:32:23.320 --> 01:32:26.140
And then when I took her home and took care of her,

1626
01:32:26.141 --> 01:32:28.810
she eventually got her voice back and she barked like a normal dog.

1627
01:32:28.811 --> 01:32:32.650
But that dog fucking loved people.
She loved people.

1628
01:32:32.651 --> 01:32:35.530
She was so happy to be out of that shit.
But she didn't like other dogs.

1629
01:32:35.531 --> 01:32:38.650
Cause if other dogs came near her,
she felt like it was a competition for love.

1630
01:32:38.890 --> 01:32:43.360
Like if you came near another dog,
that other dog was going to get that love.

1631
01:32:43.540 --> 01:32:46.990
So she would get upset at that dog for stealing love from her and she would try

1632
01:32:46.991 --> 01:32:51.100
to attack it.
So I loved her to equally,
even though she was an idiot,
you know,

1633
01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:54.730
but it wasn't her fault that she was an idiot.
You know,
I,
it would,
I would,
uh,

1634
01:32:55.030 --> 01:32:56.050
I realized from then on,

1635
01:32:56.051 --> 01:32:59.680
I will never get a dog that's not a puppy that you got to raise him from the

1636
01:32:59.681 --> 01:33:02.470
time they're puppies because then you don't have any,

1637
01:33:02.500 --> 01:33:07.210
they don't have any phobias or weirdness and you get a chance to raise them

1638
01:33:07.211 --> 01:33:10.960
around people and raised them around other dogs and socialize them.

1639
01:33:10.961 --> 01:33:12.970
And it's an important aspect of humans.

1640
01:33:13.180 --> 01:33:17.260
Just like it's an important aspect of any other animal that's in our culture.
So,

1641
01:33:17.290 --> 01:33:18.970
um,
you know,
I,

1642
01:33:19.030 --> 01:33:22.800
you can love your fucking shitty kids just as much as you love your good kid.

1643
01:33:22.801 --> 01:33:24.880
It's just because it's partly your fault that they're shitty.

1644
01:33:25.030 --> 01:33:26.800
I don't know about though.
You eat your party,

1645
01:33:26.830 --> 01:33:28.920
it's your fault for being them into the world.
Some people just won't stop.

1646
01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:34.030
I don't believe that.
I believe.
No,
I don't think so.
I think,
um,

1647
01:33:34.090 --> 01:33:37.590
I think it's how they're,
some people require more attention,
uh,
on,

1648
01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:39.220
I don't think people are born assholes.

1649
01:33:40.670 --> 01:33:41.890
<v 3>There's nature versus nurture.</v>

1650
01:33:41.891 --> 01:33:46.891
But I think that because there are people who endure in what I would consider.

1651
01:33:47.291 --> 01:33:51.940
Many other people consider intolerable stress and abuse and don't become

1652
01:33:51.941 --> 01:33:52.990
psychotic assholes.

1653
01:33:53.140 --> 01:33:56.350
And then there are people who are born or raised in the most loving and

1654
01:33:56.351 --> 01:33:58.360
nurturing,
uh,
uh,
uh,
and,
and,

1655
01:33:58.361 --> 01:34:01.780
and permit and permissive and enabling environments and become

1656
01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:05.000
<v 2>deranged lunatic.
So how do you account for now by that?</v>

1657
01:34:05.001 --> 01:34:07.280
I think those people that become deranged lunatics,

1658
01:34:07.281 --> 01:34:09.830
they probably didn't get the attention that it deserved or they probably didn't

1659
01:34:09.831 --> 01:34:10.820
get the look.

1660
01:34:11.030 --> 01:34:15.920
Raising a human being is not as simple as just sending the kids to school and

1661
01:34:16.010 --> 01:34:19.070
talk him into bed at night.
You,
you're,
you're,
you're training them,

1662
01:34:19.100 --> 01:34:23.210
you're communicating with them,
you're imparting love and you're in part they,

1663
01:34:23.330 --> 01:34:25.370
they learn by imitating their atmosphere.

1664
01:34:25.460 --> 01:34:28.760
They learned by imitating their environment or they learned because they get

1665
01:34:28.761 --> 01:34:30.900
ignored and they figure shit out on their own.
Some do

1666
01:34:31.290 --> 01:34:34.930
<v 3>learn different ways and people absorb the lessons they learn in different ways.</v>

1667
01:34:34.931 --> 01:34:38.290
It's like you were talking about the sort of the chemical makeup of a fighter

1668
01:34:38.380 --> 01:34:42.010
and how different bones and different bodies respond differently to different

1669
01:34:42.011 --> 01:34:45.400
stimulus and depending on your size and your shape and,
and,

1670
01:34:45.401 --> 01:34:48.660
and your training and your steroids or whatever.
I think that that happened.

1671
01:34:48.670 --> 01:34:49.780
That's,
that's true of a becoming.

1672
01:34:49.781 --> 01:34:53.710
You're born with a certain chemical balance and I'm not saying that can't shift

1673
01:34:53.711 --> 01:34:57.980
or change with time,
but I think there are certain inclinations we are

1674
01:34:57.980 --> 01:35:02.980
<v 2>born with good or bad that cannot be rectified by a proper or upbringing born</v>

1675
01:35:05.151 --> 01:35:07.970
with like right out of the box right out of the box.
I don't buy that at all.

1676
01:35:07.971 --> 01:35:10.340
You're gay,
you're crazy.
You're black,

1677
01:35:10.430 --> 01:35:14.450
you're white world and crazy and black all in one sentence.
How dare you.

1678
01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:16.100
No wonder why people are so upset at you.

1679
01:35:16.430 --> 01:35:21.320
It's just those were mutually exclusive uh,
examples and I just,

1680
01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:22.790
but I think that there are,

1681
01:35:23.150 --> 01:35:28.150
there are unquestionably characteristics that you cannot raise or beat or love

1682
01:35:29.591 --> 01:35:32.360
out of somebody that they are just ingrained in them.

1683
01:35:32.390 --> 01:35:35.720
I think you should probably have kids before you say that.
I really do.

1684
01:35:35.750 --> 01:35:38.390
I think he's probably have kids and raise them from the time they're babies and

1685
01:35:38.391 --> 01:35:41.480
see the developmental process.
Cause it's a lot of you,

1686
01:35:41.481 --> 01:35:45.530
what you're doing right now is just speculating and me,
I've raised three kids.

1687
01:35:45.530 --> 01:35:49.340
I've been there,
I've,
I've,
I've seen the process of good and bad,

1688
01:35:49.341 --> 01:35:50.600
the corrective process.

1689
01:35:50.601 --> 01:35:55.601
And I've been very lucky that my kids don't have develop developmental issues or

1690
01:35:55.671 --> 01:35:58.190
mental issues,
and some kids are certainly born with that,

1691
01:35:58.490 --> 01:36:00.500
but I think to a large extent,

1692
01:36:00.530 --> 01:36:05.530
children imitate their environment and there's certainly a lot of deterministic

1693
01:36:06.201 --> 01:36:07.034
factors.

1694
01:36:07.130 --> 01:36:12.130
There's a lot of genetic factors is a lot of like in intangible variables that

1695
01:36:12.771 --> 01:36:15.720
are difficult to,
there's going to be kids that are more selfish.

1696
01:36:15.721 --> 01:36:17.060
She's going to be kids that are more angry.

1697
01:36:17.061 --> 01:36:18.920
There's going to be kids that are more outgoing.

1698
01:36:18.921 --> 01:36:20.970
There's going to be kids that are more gregarious,

1699
01:36:21.220 --> 01:36:23.960
but you're always gonna have that regardless if you're going to have shitty

1700
01:36:23.961 --> 01:36:28.490
people though shitty people come from abuse.
Almost always.

1701
01:36:28.700 --> 01:36:31.400
Almost always when you have a really terrible person,

1702
01:36:31.430 --> 01:36:34.970
that terrible person is not treated with love.
Almost universally,

1703
01:36:35.450 --> 01:36:40.450
I just don't buy that unless you have some like real issue,

1704
01:36:41.030 --> 01:36:45.620
like a real brain issue,
right?
Where there's like some part of the mind,

1705
01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:49.490
it develops decay or there's a tumor,
there's an injury,

1706
01:36:49.491 --> 01:36:52.490
there's something where there's a,
there's a disconnect.

1707
01:36:52.790 --> 01:36:57.590
[inaudible] very critical processes.
Unless that's the case,
like you don't,

1708
01:36:57.620 --> 01:37:01.760
you don't make a monster.
I believe.
I said,
I don't think that's true.
I think,

1709
01:37:01.820 --> 01:37:06.820
I think you can choose to be a good person or a bad person.

1710
01:37:07.310 --> 01:37:12.310
I think there are some people that cannot choose that are based on that.

1711
01:37:13.250 --> 01:37:16.880
Based on who.
I mean example,
you're seeing it's a very bold statement.

1712
01:37:17.420 --> 01:37:18.860
I don't think it's that.
I don't,

1713
01:37:18.870 --> 01:37:21.560
I don't think they're very bold saying that some people are fucked from birth.

1714
01:37:22.100 --> 01:37:24.850
That's what you're saying.
I'm not talking about this spiritual way.
I,
I'm,
I'm,

1715
01:37:24.860 --> 01:37:27.320
I'm talking about it and very much saying spiritual were saying the way they

1716
01:37:27.321 --> 01:37:30.940
behaved.
Like you,
you're saying that some people,
no matter what you do,

1717
01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:32.240
no matter what,
how much effort you put in,

1718
01:37:32.241 --> 01:37:35.480
how much love you give these kids and how much IX you expose them to different

1719
01:37:35.481 --> 01:37:38.840
environments.
You give them different tasks and different learning opportunities.

1720
01:37:38.960 --> 01:37:42.360
There's still going to be shitheads.
Yes.
That's,
that's,

1721
01:37:43.070 --> 01:37:46.280
that's such a bold statement that says,
but why would you say that?
That's bay.

1722
01:37:46.340 --> 01:37:50.070
You have no data.
It's not based on anything.
Oh,
yeah,
but,
but,
but,
but,
but,

1723
01:37:50.120 --> 01:37:52.770
but it's also a question about how you define,
but it is there,

1724
01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:55.980
there's isolated cases of that.
Every week there's isolate.
It's Affluenza.

1725
01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:59.730
Affluenza is like isolated cases.

1726
01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:02.700
You should have those isolated cases in your mind.

1727
01:38:02.701 --> 01:38:06.240
If you're saying some siting right now I'm citing the Atla the affluenza cases

1728
01:38:06.241 --> 01:38:10.440
for example.
Oh,
that's this gift.
Flu.
No,
no,
no,
not influenza.

1729
01:38:10.590 --> 01:38:12.360
Affluenza.
Oh,
athletics.

1730
01:38:13.560 --> 01:38:17.820
It's this new made up thing that say these kids are shitheads because they've

1731
01:38:17.830 --> 01:38:21.640
been given,
they've been given everything in life.
So now they're assholes as,

1732
01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:23.550
and you would argue and,
and,
and,

1733
01:38:23.551 --> 01:38:27.960
and the ferry was there most likely ignored because they have money doesn't mean

1734
01:38:27.961 --> 01:38:31.350
they have love and doesn't mean they have learning experiences.

1735
01:38:31.470 --> 01:38:35.190
Doesn't mean someone has been nurturing them or guiding them or mentoring them.

1736
01:38:35.310 --> 01:38:37.770
Those are the issues that people have.
It's not money.
What I'm saying,

1737
01:38:37.771 --> 01:38:39.630
it's also possible that they have mental defects.

1738
01:38:39.631 --> 01:38:41.520
That's all I'm really talking about,
which is what you've already said.

1739
01:38:41.521 --> 01:38:46.440
Which that is that.
Sure.
People who have,
who are wired is what I'm saying to,
to,

1740
01:38:46.500 --> 01:38:50.780
to uh,
propensities to violence to be shot.

1741
01:38:51.330 --> 01:38:53.850
It's very possible that they do.
However,

1742
01:38:53.851 --> 01:38:57.360
most likely if they become costs is because someone did a shitty job of raising

1743
01:38:57.361 --> 01:39:01.620
them.
That includes this Affluenza,
which is a very new term,

1744
01:39:01.621 --> 01:39:04.920
which is why I fucked me up because it's a horrible thing.

1745
01:39:05.420 --> 01:39:08.220
It shouldn't be a thing.
Well,
they've been using this to exonerate people.

1746
01:39:08.750 --> 01:39:12.210
It's crazy,
bizarre world though where we are and you're going to,

1747
01:39:12.211 --> 01:39:15.240
you're going to get on me about this too because I don't have kids,
but his,

1748
01:39:15.241 --> 01:39:18.180
this world where everybody's looking for an answer for why their kid's an

1749
01:39:18.181 --> 01:39:18.541
asshole,

1750
01:39:18.541 --> 01:39:21.360
for why their kids acting out for why their kid is too sensitive for why they're

1751
01:39:21.361 --> 01:39:23.340
getting and everybody needs a diagnosis.

1752
01:39:23.341 --> 01:39:27.000
Everybody in orange and or a drug that can help fix them.

1753
01:39:27.210 --> 01:39:29.580
Everybody needs to know like,
oh,
I'm not fucking up.

1754
01:39:29.610 --> 01:39:32.670
My kid actually has some invented.

1755
01:39:32.810 --> 01:39:36.990
Likely by the time you have one of those issues,
you've already fucked her care.

1756
01:39:37.620 --> 01:39:40.770
That's what's going on.
Children or animals.
Okay.

1757
01:39:40.770 --> 01:39:43.290
Just like a person on a grown adult.
It's a puppy animal.

1758
01:39:44.190 --> 01:39:47.430
It's an animal and animals react to their environment.

1759
01:39:47.431 --> 01:39:51.930
Have you ever had a feral cat?
No.
I've had feral cats and my friend Lanie,

1760
01:39:52.140 --> 01:39:55.830
her and her boyfriend found these fucking cats underneath the house and the the,

1761
01:39:55.840 --> 01:39:58.930
the,
this cat had given birth these cats and she was given away kittens and I,

1762
01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:00.420
again,
I have to take in stray.

1763
01:40:00.421 --> 01:40:03.960
So I took this fucking stray inn and this crazy fucking cat was in my house.

1764
01:40:04.170 --> 01:40:09.090
And learning from feral cats,
you realize like,
oh,
okay,

1765
01:40:09.240 --> 01:40:12.720
like this cat is already fucked.
Like by the time I got to it,

1766
01:40:12.721 --> 01:40:14.970
it was x amount of months old or whatever it was.

1767
01:40:14.971 --> 01:40:17.550
There was no fixing this fucking thing.
It was already fucked.

1768
01:40:17.790 --> 01:40:20.400
And that is the case with human beings.

1769
01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:25.200
You develop a certain amount of pathways in your,
your mind,

1770
01:40:25.230 --> 01:40:26.130
in your intellect,

1771
01:40:26.820 --> 01:40:31.410
in the way you comprehend the world and the way you,
you,
you,

1772
01:40:31.411 --> 01:40:32.970
you interact with your environment.

1773
01:40:33.060 --> 01:40:36.780
That's based upon the dangers that you've been exposed to based upon the input

1774
01:40:36.781 --> 01:40:37.590
that you've had.

1775
01:40:37.590 --> 01:40:42.090
And once those pathways are defined in a very violent negative way or whether

1776
01:40:42.091 --> 01:40:45.390
you've been ignored or whether you've been spoiled to the point where you could

1777
01:40:45.391 --> 01:40:49.830
scream at the help and yell at the housekeepers and everybody bows down in front

1778
01:40:49.831 --> 01:40:53.620
of you because you're a Rockefeller or so,
he said something along those lines,

1779
01:40:53.621 --> 01:40:56.620
the affluenza aspect of it.
When you get to a certain point,

1780
01:40:56.621 --> 01:41:01.060
those pathways are so established in the mind that it's insanely difficult to

1781
01:41:01.061 --> 01:41:04.060
change that.
So when you're coming along you're saying like,
Hey,
you know,

1782
01:41:04.061 --> 01:41:08.500
I need a pill to fix my kid.
No,
you didn't pay attention to them enough.

1783
01:41:08.530 --> 01:41:11.230
Like a child needs constant attention.

1784
01:41:11.380 --> 01:41:14.530
Babies need to have a mother around them all the time.

1785
01:41:14.531 --> 01:41:17.380
A father around them all the time,
they need input.

1786
01:41:17.500 --> 01:41:20.440
They need to try to develop an understanding of their world.

1787
01:41:20.590 --> 01:41:24.280
And a lot of people don't do that.
They pass their kid off to the fucking nanny.

1788
01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:27.430
They don't pay attention to it when it cries in the crib and they,

1789
01:41:27.480 --> 01:41:31.900
they wonder why their kid gets fucked up when they're working 17 hours a day and

1790
01:41:31.901 --> 01:41:32.950
they never see the kid and I'm like,

1791
01:41:33.070 --> 01:41:36.430
I don't have any fucking time to deal with this kid.
Let's put him on Prozac.

1792
01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:37.540
Well,
how do you,
what happened?

1793
01:41:37.570 --> 01:41:39.670
How do you then explain to people who overcome adversity,

1794
01:41:39.671 --> 01:41:41.620
who come from horrific life?

1795
01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:46.150
Just because you can make something of themselves because you can because it can

1796
01:41:46.151 --> 01:41:47.770
be done.
Doesn't mean everyone's going to do it.

1797
01:41:47.950 --> 01:41:50.920
Not everyone's going to finish a fucking marathon just because people start

1798
01:41:50.921 --> 01:41:54.310
running.
Some people run a hundred miles,
they do that ultra marathon.

1799
01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:57.010
Some people get five miles in there like,
I can't fucking do this.

1800
01:41:57.130 --> 01:41:59.920
And for whatever reason they decided to take a nap.

1801
01:41:59.921 --> 01:42:03.610
They decided to sit on the side of the highway and stop.
Some people,
they decide,

1802
01:42:03.611 --> 01:42:05.830
you know what,
my mom was a prostitute,

1803
01:42:05.831 --> 01:42:09.310
my dad was a junkie and I am not going to be like that.

1804
01:42:09.311 --> 01:42:11.050
I'm going to learn it and I'm never going to have a drink.

1805
01:42:11.170 --> 01:42:16.030
I have a friend who's a great guy and his grandmother used to lock him in his

1806
01:42:16.031 --> 01:42:19.840
fucking room and lock the door and leave him there for the weekend so she could

1807
01:42:19.841 --> 01:42:23.860
get drunk.
His mom was never there,
his parents were never there and he,

1808
01:42:23.861 --> 01:42:27.770
this fucking guy to this day won't touch alcohol and not to say I'm not against

1809
01:42:27.771 --> 01:42:31.810
whole.
Right.
And is terrified about food.
Like he,
oh he will,

1810
01:42:31.820 --> 01:42:33.310
he will not throw food away.

1811
01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:35.800
Like when he goes to a restaurant and he gets scrapped.

1812
01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:39.040
I mean it can be a tiny portion.
That guy will take that to go with him.

1813
01:42:39.041 --> 01:42:42.940
He will not waste food is because when he was a kid he was exposed to this

1814
01:42:42.941 --> 01:42:44.140
horrible situation.

1815
01:42:44.320 --> 01:42:47.350
But other people could have been exposed to that and become a serial killer.

1816
01:42:47.470 --> 01:42:51.430
Other people can mix both supposed to the same situation and design because the

1817
01:42:51.431 --> 01:42:54.510
pre predisposed to being good or bad people.
That's exactly.
No,

1818
01:42:54.520 --> 01:42:57.700
it's not a predisposed.
He made choices and it became a fighter.

1819
01:42:57.850 --> 01:43:01.180
And one of the things about martial arts gave him a sense of self worth and

1820
01:43:01.181 --> 01:43:03.500
character.
But you can't say that it's,

1821
01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:08.760
he's predisposed to be a good person or someone else would be predisposed to be

1822
01:43:08.861 --> 01:43:09.694
a bad person.

1823
01:43:09.820 --> 01:43:14.050
A lot of it is these subtle variables that happen when you're interacting with

1824
01:43:14.051 --> 01:43:17.110
your environment.
I think some of those subtle variables that are chemical,

1825
01:43:17.111 --> 01:43:21.250
they are in the brain.
They,
they,
they do,
they do exist in end.
It's possible,

1826
01:43:21.251 --> 01:43:24.610
but it's also you should know what you're talking about when you're saying these

1827
01:43:24.611 --> 01:43:25.480
kinds of things.
Like you're,

1828
01:43:25.630 --> 01:43:29.380
you're stating them as facts and I think there's a real issue with that when you

1829
01:43:29.381 --> 01:43:32.410
don't have any data.
I'm seeing them as opinions.

1830
01:43:32.470 --> 01:43:35.560
But you're not seeing here is you're saying when you're saying that some people

1831
01:43:35.561 --> 01:43:38.620
are,
fuck I'm saying,
I believe I'm saying that people,

1832
01:43:38.720 --> 01:43:41.100
but you're arguing it so strongly like you,

1833
01:43:41.190 --> 01:43:43.540
you have this in your mind as a rigid idea.

1834
01:43:43.640 --> 01:43:48.220
I mean there's definitely possibilities as far as mental deficiencies.
I mean,

1835
01:43:48.221 --> 01:43:51.130
look,
some people are born blind,
you know,
some people are born,

1836
01:43:51.270 --> 01:43:54.350
they don't have any hands.
So there's,
there's a lot of issues with human beings.

1837
01:43:54.351 --> 01:43:55.610
We don't come out perfect.

1838
01:43:55.880 --> 01:43:59.810
But to say that some people could do a great job and the kid's just gonna be a

1839
01:43:59.811 --> 01:44:02.900
monster anyway,
most likely not.
Most likely.

1840
01:44:02.901 --> 01:44:06.830
What you're seeing is people that do not want to take responsibility for the

1841
01:44:06.831 --> 01:44:09.530
fact that they did a shitty job of developing a human being.

1842
01:44:09.590 --> 01:44:13.100
That might be by and large shoe,
but you do have,
but,
but,
but,
uh,

1843
01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:17.920
schizophrenia is,
is a legitimate mental defect.
I can't believe,

1844
01:44:17.960 --> 01:44:21.050
I don't believe we're talking about race,
but that's what I'm talking about.

1845
01:44:21.051 --> 01:44:24.920
I'm talking about disposition to Ken about leukemia or schizophrenia.

1846
01:44:24.921 --> 01:44:28.850
You're talking about people being assholes.
No,
no,
no,
no.
I'm not.

1847
01:44:28.910 --> 01:44:29.810
But that's what you were saying.

1848
01:44:30.260 --> 01:44:34.970
If you grow up to be a truly disturbed individual,
there are,

1849
01:44:35.240 --> 01:44:40.240
there's not always an opportunity to change that or to reverse that trend

1850
01:44:40.341 --> 01:44:43.420
regardless of how well your broad opera,

1851
01:44:43.430 --> 01:44:47.270
how loving Affluenza as an example of that.

1852
01:44:47.271 --> 01:44:50.780
That's not schizophrenia.
That's a people that are ignored their fucking kids.

1853
01:44:50.800 --> 01:44:51.351
Oh No,
absolutely.

1854
01:44:51.351 --> 01:44:54.920
What I'm saying but I'm saying is is is is that there are people who have a

1855
01:44:54.921 --> 01:44:58.820
predisposition towards certain behavior and there are people who may or may not

1856
01:44:58.821 --> 01:45:01.910
be be raised.
Right.
I think we're confusing the two issues.

1857
01:45:01.911 --> 01:45:05.270
I think ultimately you might actually be saying the same thing in one way or

1858
01:45:05.271 --> 01:45:09.140
another,
but I'm saying I'm talking about legitimate defects in individuals,

1859
01:45:09.440 --> 01:45:13.730
legitimate defects and individuals call them,
call them mutations,

1860
01:45:13.740 --> 01:45:16.880
called them what you will most certainly there are legitimate defects in certain

1861
01:45:16.881 --> 01:45:21.410
individuals most certainly but I think that a lot of what we're dealing with as

1862
01:45:21.411 --> 01:45:25.310
a culture as a community is if you look at people in indigenous cultures,

1863
01:45:25.890 --> 01:45:27.620
they're constantly around their children,

1864
01:45:27.650 --> 01:45:29.740
they spend all this time with their children and you,

1865
01:45:29.741 --> 01:45:33.080
you see far less instances of mental issues.

1866
01:45:33.260 --> 01:45:35.420
You see far less mental diseases,

1867
01:45:35.630 --> 01:45:39.680
you say far less issues of depression.

1868
01:45:39.710 --> 01:45:44.710
And there's this sort of existential angst that we exhibit almost like more

1869
01:45:46.401 --> 01:45:48.560
frequently than not in our culture.

1870
01:45:48.740 --> 01:45:52.190
And I think a lot of that has to do with the developmental process of a child is

1871
01:45:52.220 --> 01:45:55.980
not just misunderstood,
but is ignored and is,

1872
01:45:55.981 --> 01:46:00.200
is treated in a way where it's,
it's a very irresponsible,

1873
01:46:00.260 --> 01:46:03.020
the way a lot of people raised children.
Like I have friends,

1874
01:46:03.021 --> 01:46:05.390
I'm still really nice.
I have two friends that are very,

1875
01:46:05.400 --> 01:46:10.400
they're very nice folks and they both work insanely difficult jobs where they're

1876
01:46:10.701 --> 01:46:13.970
gone all day long and their kids are starting to be fucked up.

1877
01:46:14.360 --> 01:46:16.190
And we've been friends with them for a long time.

1878
01:46:16.191 --> 01:46:19.040
So I've known the kids since they were little.
They've got a kid.
I mean,

1879
01:46:19.041 --> 01:46:23.210
I can't be too specific about it or I'll be,
but their son,

1880
01:46:23.211 --> 01:46:25.800
it's fucked up man.
And they're smart,
but they're,

1881
01:46:25.850 --> 01:46:28.910
they don't have the time and they're not around the kid all the time.

1882
01:46:28.911 --> 01:46:31.580
And the kids terrified and he fucking screens in the middle of the night all the

1883
01:46:31.581 --> 01:46:33.800
time.
They're never home.
They're,
they're fucking,
they're,

1884
01:46:33.830 --> 01:46:35.420
they have nannies to take care of them.

1885
01:46:35.570 --> 01:46:40.520
And the kids are really confused and these people have long hours,

1886
01:46:40.521 --> 01:46:43.280
they work long hours and I don't see that changing.

1887
01:46:43.281 --> 01:46:46.430
And I see their kids coming out of this in a very fucked up way and I'm watching

1888
01:46:46.431 --> 01:46:50.370
it happen from the beginning to,
to where they are now to the point where me,

1889
01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:52.050
me and my family were kind of avoiding them.

1890
01:46:52.050 --> 01:46:54.420
Now we don't want to hang out with them because their kids are starting to be

1891
01:46:54.421 --> 01:46:56.190
disturbed.
They started the,
they're,
they're,

1892
01:46:56.220 --> 01:47:00.600
they're acting aggressive towards other kids and some sort of a weird way.
Um,

1893
01:47:00.630 --> 01:47:04.230
you there,
there need to be around their parents.
It's like,
it's,
it's not,

1894
01:47:04.260 --> 01:47:07.620
it's not normal.
It's like this like,
like they're drowning,
you know,

1895
01:47:07.621 --> 01:47:10.620
like they need air and their parents are air.
It's like they cling to them,

1896
01:47:10.621 --> 01:47:12.390
they hold onto them,
they're scared of everything.

1897
01:47:12.600 --> 01:47:16.050
And what it is is these kids are not being nurtured correctly because it's not

1898
01:47:16.051 --> 01:47:19.380
natural in the wild as a human being,
as an organism.

1899
01:47:19.410 --> 01:47:21.970
It's not natural to be away from your,

1900
01:47:22.100 --> 01:47:25.470
your parents for 16 hours of every day.
It's not,

1901
01:47:25.590 --> 01:47:29.460
it's not natural to see your parents just as you go to bed and as you wake up,

1902
01:47:29.461 --> 01:47:30.930
that's fucking crazy.

1903
01:47:31.110 --> 01:47:34.350
But that is the norm for a lot of these people that want their cake and they

1904
01:47:34.351 --> 01:47:37.890
want to eat it too.
They want to have a career and also have children.
You know,

1905
01:47:37.891 --> 01:47:42.891
I know a woman who is a fucking huge executive at a major company and this crazy

1906
01:47:43.771 --> 01:47:47.880
lady has three kids and they're all nuts.
They're fucking kids are nuts.

1907
01:47:47.881 --> 01:47:51.570
You know why?
Cause Mommy barely exists.
Mommy barely,
ma'am,

1908
01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:55.290
mommy exists in their life for 10 minutes a day.
That's nuts,
man.

1909
01:47:55.410 --> 01:48:00.150
That's nuts for a three year old and they don't know what mommy is.

1910
01:48:00.180 --> 01:48:01.530
They don't,
they're not around her.

1911
01:48:01.680 --> 01:48:04.200
You're supposed to be around her hours and hours.

1912
01:48:04.690 --> 01:48:08.190
I supposed to be cuddled and nurtured and you play with them and you teach them

1913
01:48:08.191 --> 01:48:10.950
about life.
You teach them how to talk and how to count,
you know?

1914
01:48:10.951 --> 01:48:13.980
And then I have another friend and his wife doesn't work at all.

1915
01:48:14.040 --> 01:48:15.540
And the kid is three,

1916
01:48:15.630 --> 01:48:19.020
it can already count to a thousand and already knows how to spell his name is

1917
01:48:19.021 --> 01:48:21.030
spelled words because why?

1918
01:48:21.031 --> 01:48:24.960
Because the mom's interacting with the kid all day long and this kid is happy

1919
01:48:24.961 --> 01:48:29.961
and I'm seeing the direct effect of people nurturing their kid and developing

1920
01:48:31.471 --> 01:48:33.990
their kid as a project,
mentoring their kid.

1921
01:48:34.140 --> 01:48:38.460
The same way you would mentor someone about how to do martial arts the same way

1922
01:48:38.461 --> 01:48:43.030
you were mentored or someone about how to write or how to do mathematics.
You're,

1923
01:48:43.070 --> 01:48:46.830
you're developing a thing,
a thinking thing,

1924
01:48:46.980 --> 01:48:48.100
and that's what a human being in

1925
01:48:48.230 --> 01:48:53.230
<v 3>and I can't fathom the a parent who would have this human being that is born of</v>

1926
01:48:55.131 --> 01:48:58.010
them that would not want to engage at that level.

1927
01:48:58.070 --> 01:48:59.660
You know what it meaning that they only go,

1928
01:48:59.690 --> 01:49:02.450
I want to go to work and leave my three children in the care of some other

1929
01:49:02.451 --> 01:49:07.370
person who is not physically,
you know,
he was not responsible for them in,
in,

1930
01:49:07.380 --> 01:49:10.730
in the,
and the absolute way that I would be respond.
I can't even,

1931
01:49:10.820 --> 01:49:13.160
I can't even fathom that,
that mentality.

1932
01:49:13.161 --> 01:49:17.220
So I'm not trying to get parents off the hook with this theory,

1933
01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:21.240
but you also had an example of a perfectly,
uh,
uh,

1934
01:49:21.350 --> 01:49:26.000
well adjusted outstanding citizen and an upright citizen,

1935
01:49:26.001 --> 01:49:31.001
a human being who came from a horrible environment and let's not get carried

1936
01:49:31.341 --> 01:49:34.160
away.
He's not an outstanding human being fucked up.

1937
01:49:35.060 --> 01:49:37.560
He's a fighter fucked up.
I think what

1938
01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:41.580
<v 2>I'm saying is this guy won't drink and he won't,
he won't look waste food.</v>

1939
01:49:41.610 --> 01:49:45.420
And this is directly because of his whole childhood.
He's not a good guy.

1940
01:49:45.640 --> 01:49:46.750
He's in fact,
he's,

1941
01:49:46.751 --> 01:49:50.140
he's kind of abusive towards his children and he's got issues of his own.

1942
01:49:50.260 --> 01:49:51.190
He's not a good guy.

1943
01:49:51.320 --> 01:49:55.270
What I'm saying is there's a direct response to this guy living in this horrible

1944
01:49:55.271 --> 01:49:59.650
life as a child to him saying,
I am not going to be like that anymore.

1945
01:49:59.740 --> 01:50:02.320
I'm going to make sure I don't do drugs.
I'm gonna make sure I don't drink.

1946
01:50:02.530 --> 01:50:05.620
And this is because he lived in this horrible environment.

1947
01:50:05.621 --> 01:50:08.950
We saw the direct effects of someone being an alcoholic and whatnot.

1948
01:50:09.910 --> 01:50:13.690
But he's still,
he's a shitty parent,
you know?
I mean this is,

1949
01:50:14.170 --> 01:50:16.120
it's a very complex issue.

1950
01:50:16.210 --> 01:50:19.540
It's a very complex issue raising children and it's an issue where people

1951
01:50:19.541 --> 01:50:24.370
conveniently intelligent people conveniently like to skirt the responsibility of

1952
01:50:24.371 --> 01:50:27.460
what it is to raise their children.
And I see it from friends,

1953
01:50:27.670 --> 01:50:32.200
I see it from friends that work long hours and it's one of the reasons why I

1954
01:50:32.201 --> 01:50:35.650
choose to work much fewer hours than I could.

1955
01:50:36.100 --> 01:50:38.260
I want to be around,
I'm leaving from here,

1956
01:50:38.261 --> 01:50:41.680
I'm going to go pick up my kid and when I do that I'm going to hang out with

1957
01:50:41.681 --> 01:50:45.190
them and I'm going to play and we're going to have a good time and we're going

1958
01:50:45.191 --> 01:50:48.940
to talk about stuff.
And I think that's a responsibility that a parent has.

1959
01:50:49.270 --> 01:50:50.530
I think people evolve toward that.

1960
01:50:50.531 --> 01:50:53.510
And not only in terms of becoming a parent and your priorities change,

1961
01:50:53.511 --> 01:50:56.560
but like as as I get older I can kind of,
I can,

1962
01:50:56.590 --> 01:50:59.800
I can sense that happening and be like,
I want to work less.

1963
01:50:59.950 --> 01:51:02.380
I want to enjoy life and have

1964
01:51:04.630 --> 01:51:06.750
ambition is great.
It's great.
I mean it,

1965
01:51:06.760 --> 01:51:09.790
it allows us to become successful to the point where we would have less stress.

1966
01:51:09.790 --> 01:51:13.780
You have a nice home,
you have food on a table,
you can take care of your needs,

1967
01:51:13.960 --> 01:51:16.210
but when it gets past a certain point,
you know,

1968
01:51:16.211 --> 01:51:18.310
my friend Brian Cowen said it best.
He said,

1969
01:51:18.340 --> 01:51:21.670
you want to be successful enough where you don't worry about what it costs to go

1970
01:51:21.671 --> 01:51:25.330
out to dinner.
He goes after that.
It's all bullshit and it's,
he's right it,

1971
01:51:25.450 --> 01:51:28.720
I mean,
once you know,
you can have a nice meal and you don't worry about food,

1972
01:51:28.900 --> 01:51:30.750
you don't worry about having a roof over your head.
You don't have,

1973
01:51:30.780 --> 01:51:32.920
you don't have to live in a dangerous neighborhood.

1974
01:51:33.040 --> 01:51:34.560
You can afford to live in an area where you,

1975
01:51:34.570 --> 01:51:37.720
you know that your family and your loved ones are safe.
Other than that,

1976
01:51:37.721 --> 01:51:40.600
it's all bullshit.
Will you have a bigger house and then a bigger,

1977
01:51:40.601 --> 01:51:44.650
and now you have a castle.
Now you own an island and come on,
it's all mo money,

1978
01:51:44.651 --> 01:51:46.830
Mo problems.
Biggie said it right.
You know,

1979
01:51:47.980 --> 01:51:51.070
at a certain point in time it becomes you.
You,

1980
01:51:51.090 --> 01:51:55.510
you trap yourself with your own ambition and you get yourself into a situation

1981
01:51:55.511 --> 01:51:58.900
where you realize like,
oh,
this is not the smart way to do this.

1982
01:51:58.901 --> 01:52:03.610
I've just been caught up in this,
this zero sum game,
this idea that,
you know,

1983
01:52:03.611 --> 01:52:07.120
there's a,
there's a certain amount,
you know,
like you have to continue to grow.

1984
01:52:07.121 --> 01:52:10.600
You have to continue to expand.
Like,
like a corporation.
We just had,
you know,

1985
01:52:10.601 --> 01:52:13.750
we're coming,
we're coming out to la,
we make once a year we make the pilgrimage,

1986
01:52:13.790 --> 01:52:14.080
um,
you know,

1987
01:52:14.080 --> 01:52:17.200
be otherwise we work and live in Miami and we're coming out to la and it's like

1988
01:52:17.800 --> 01:52:22.690
we had a meeting and it's like this is on one hand it's like this is the most

1989
01:52:22.691 --> 01:52:25.780
important meeting of our careers.
And then I thought about it,

1990
01:52:26.410 --> 01:52:28.990
cause I like to do this sometimes just kind of flips something on its head and

1991
01:52:28.991 --> 01:52:31.720
go 180 degrees and say,
what if my belief is the exact,

1992
01:52:32.050 --> 01:52:35.950
what if the reality is he is the exact opposite of my belief.
So I said,

1993
01:52:36.610 --> 01:52:41.260
what if this is the least important meeting of our careers?
And it dawned on me,

1994
01:52:41.261 --> 01:52:43.420
it's like,
it's something kind of outside of our,
it's,

1995
01:52:43.421 --> 01:52:44.410
it's in the entertainment industry,

1996
01:52:44.411 --> 01:52:46.160
but it's kind of outside of our core competency

1997
01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:47.630
<v 3>is nonfiction filmmakers.</v>

1998
01:52:47.900 --> 01:52:52.700
And it certainly would advance us in the industry,
but I was just like,

1999
01:52:53.420 --> 01:52:56.570
if nothing comes of it or it doesn't go well,

2000
01:52:56.660 --> 01:53:00.200
this most important meeting of our careers,
we go home,

2001
01:53:00.500 --> 01:53:04.010
we go back to work making our documentaries.
I very little to complain about,

2002
01:53:04.220 --> 01:53:04.780
you know,
I,

2003
01:53:04.780 --> 01:53:08.720
I don't have to worry about where my next meal is gonna come from or where or if

2004
01:53:08.721 --> 01:53:12.340
I'm going to have a roof over my head,
I still got to work,
you know,
I said,

2005
01:53:12.560 --> 01:53:15.080
but we'll just keep doing what we've always been doing and what we're pretty

2006
01:53:15.081 --> 01:53:20.050
happy,
you know,
it pretty,
pretty happy in life.
Like what more do I actually,
well,

2007
01:53:20.051 --> 01:53:22.070
I love,
I love to be able to support my parents a little bit,

2008
01:53:22.071 --> 01:53:24.650
but like there's little things like that,
but like,
but beyond that,

2009
01:53:24.651 --> 01:53:27.920
it's just like,
so what happens if this most important meeting doesn't go well?

2010
01:53:27.920 --> 01:53:31.550
It's like life is still pretty good.
Like,
I don't have that much to,

2011
01:53:31.970 --> 01:53:34.160
to complain about all thing,
you know.
So yeah.

2012
01:53:34.290 --> 01:53:37.460
So I don't know if that's a product of being and 10 years ago I would have been

2013
01:53:37.461 --> 01:53:40.100
like on the,
I would have been like,
oh shit,
this is it.

2014
01:53:40.101 --> 01:53:42.860
Everything's riding on this if you,
and now I'm kinda like,

2015
01:53:42.861 --> 01:53:46.370
well but what if it doesn't go well?
It's like sly fix shit still good.
You grow,

2016
01:53:46.371 --> 01:53:47.160
you learn,

2017
01:53:47.160 --> 01:53:51.890
you just get better at functioning and you get better at coping with stress and

2018
01:53:51.891 --> 01:53:55.580
you also have a perspective of a long life.
You know,

2019
01:53:55.581 --> 01:53:59.360
you have this respective of many years of life on this planet and learning the

2020
01:53:59.361 --> 01:54:01.230
lessons.
I was thinking about that with the,
you know,

2021
01:54:01.231 --> 01:54:05.690
we were talking about the heavyweights getting older and Kimbo being forward

2022
01:54:05.691 --> 01:54:08.540
what we said 41 and know and uh,
I'm thinking,

2023
01:54:08.541 --> 01:54:12.890
cause we did this dock for ESPN called broke about professional athletes going

2024
01:54:12.891 --> 01:54:15.680
broke and exactly what you just described,

2025
01:54:15.681 --> 01:54:20.210
which is like the natural or typical trajectory of an American.

2026
01:54:20.210 --> 01:54:24.320
It's like you're born,
you go to school,
you learn a trade.

2027
01:54:24.321 --> 01:54:28.560
Presumably you graduate and enter the workforce.
You enter,

2028
01:54:28.561 --> 01:54:30.770
you're obviously at the,
at the entry level,

2029
01:54:30.830 --> 01:54:34.850
you start to work your way up in said industry or pivot to something else or

2030
01:54:34.851 --> 01:54:37.820
whatever it is,
but in the meantime you get married.
Maybe you get divorced,

2031
01:54:37.821 --> 01:54:40.550
maybe get married again.
You make some investments,
some good,
some bad.

2032
01:54:40.551 --> 01:54:42.650
You buy a house,
you have a mortgage,
maybe you have a foreclosure,

2033
01:54:42.740 --> 01:54:43.580
you get some experience.

2034
01:54:43.581 --> 01:54:47.810
You start to learn as you grow and as you grow and advance in an industry,

2035
01:54:48.260 --> 01:54:50.030
you're making more money hopefully,

2036
01:54:50.031 --> 01:54:53.900
and then by the time you're saying in your 50s you're at the peak of your
powers.

2037
01:54:53.990 --> 01:54:55.280
You are making the most,

2038
01:54:55.281 --> 01:55:00.281
you're going to make a and then you retire and that entire structure is

2039
01:55:01.701 --> 01:55:05.360
completely upside down for a professional athlete because they're going to make

2040
01:55:05.361 --> 01:55:07.220
the most money they're ever going to make in their lives.

2041
01:55:07.250 --> 01:55:11.640
It basically in their 20s even if you're a sort of premium mode,

2042
01:55:11.680 --> 01:55:13.550
they are the most successful criminal crime,
like,

2043
01:55:13.640 --> 01:55:15.530
like top 1% of a professional athletes.

2044
01:55:15.531 --> 01:55:18.260
Because the other thing that people don't understand in,
in,
in this,

2045
01:55:18.290 --> 01:55:19.880
in this business is that like,

2046
01:55:20.720 --> 01:55:23.720
and that sports and entertainment is that like not everybody is a millionaire.

2047
01:55:23.870 --> 01:55:25.160
People don't understand that.
Like,

2048
01:55:25.340 --> 01:55:29.440
not a lot of sport professional athletes are journeymen,
you know,

2049
01:55:29.450 --> 01:55:32.090
they make decent money or they make league minimum,
whatever it is,

2050
01:55:32.091 --> 01:55:33.890
but they still have to work,
you know,

2051
01:55:33.891 --> 01:55:37.100
they can't just retire tomorrow and be okay.
And,

2052
01:55:37.101 --> 01:55:41.690
and that's the thing about when people see that you,
you know,
oh,
you make movies,

2053
01:55:41.691 --> 01:55:44.310
your shit's on showtime or your,
I see your stuff all the time.

2054
01:55:44.310 --> 01:55:47.520
<v 1>Right.
You know,
you're very,
you have a,
you have a check on Twitter.
It's like,</v>

2055
01:55:47.521 --> 01:55:49.260
you must be,
you must be a millionaire.

2056
01:55:49.380 --> 01:55:52.710
There's like this incredible misconception that like in my line of work that

2057
01:55:52.711 --> 01:55:57.480
like,
uh,
we're rich and famous and we are like neither of those things,

2058
01:55:57.510 --> 01:55:57.811
you know.

2059
01:55:57.811 --> 01:56:02.430
But like I see I should be returned that fucking documentary from cocaine

2060
01:56:02.431 --> 01:56:04.230
cowboys.
If you didn't get rich somebody,
fuck.

2061
01:56:04.231 --> 01:56:08.490
The most money I've ever made in the drug industry is selling my urine to my

2062
01:56:08.491 --> 01:56:11.970
friends cause I was the only guy that didn't smoke or didn't do drug and the

2063
01:56:11.971 --> 01:56:14.520
drug industry.
Yeah.
Meaning like my friends would like,

2064
01:56:14.610 --> 01:56:17.760
they made more than that than you did from cocaine cowboys.
Yeah.
No,

2065
01:56:17.761 --> 01:56:20.850
I never sold my urine.
Good bread.
Good friends can be like,
dude,
do you,
you,

2066
01:56:21.510 --> 01:56:24.960
my employer is going to start retesting if you,
uh,
you know,
if,
if,
if you,

2067
01:56:24.961 --> 01:56:27.810
if you say you sold me some some,
but uh,
but it's,
you're like,

2068
01:56:27.811 --> 01:56:29.950
I was a kid growing up that never,
I didn't treat you well.

2069
01:56:29.950 --> 01:56:34.350
I was 21 I've ever done coke.
No,
no,
never.
Never.
Adderall.

2070
01:56:35.070 --> 01:56:39.240
A half an Adderall ones for the show.
No,
no,
no.
It's a good guess though.
Salad.

2071
01:56:39.750 --> 01:56:42.110
I eat gum before that.

2072
01:56:42.120 --> 01:56:47.070
Before the show energy gum or jolt Cola Gum.
Oh yeah,

2073
01:56:47.100 --> 01:56:48.870
don't do that.
That's a bad,

2074
01:56:48.871 --> 01:56:50.790
you're going to have a heart attack sweating a little bit.
Yeah,
that's true.

2075
01:56:51.720 --> 01:56:55.500
Plus you're going to crash at the end of this.
You're going to need a nap.
No,
no,

2076
01:56:55.501 --> 01:57:00.440
Tom,
I'm an la dude.
The pulse of this city
stops.
Yeah,
go,

2077
01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:03.550
go,
go,
go,
go,
go,
stop,
stop,
stop.
So I said go,
go,
go,
go,
go,
go,
go,
stop,
stop.

2078
01:57:03.560 --> 01:57:06.100
Stop the pulse of this city.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um,

2079
01:57:07.350 --> 01:57:09.270
so when you were doing cocaine cowboys,

2080
01:57:09.271 --> 01:57:12.870
did you ever have any desire to do coke to see what the fuss is all about?
No,

2081
01:57:12.871 --> 01:57:16.860
in fact,
what,
it's interesting,
I went to an arts high school and so,

2082
01:57:16.980 --> 01:57:20.160
and this is the mid nineties,
early,
early to mid nineties.
So,
you know,

2083
01:57:20.161 --> 01:57:22.980
drug trends,
I find like nostalgic trends are cyclical.

2084
01:57:23.070 --> 01:57:27.120
Like there are certain perennials like Potts always popular.
Um,

2085
01:57:27.360 --> 01:57:30.480
but like in the mid nineties,
it was back to like sixties trucks again.

2086
01:57:30.600 --> 01:57:34.470
People were doing,
my friends were doing like psychedelics,
they were doing acid,

2087
01:57:34.500 --> 01:57:38.460
shrooms,
good for the sea was ecstasy was like in a similar genre.

2088
01:57:38.461 --> 01:57:43.020
So MDA was on the rise.
Then a high school kids couldn't afford cocaine,

2089
01:57:43.021 --> 01:57:45.990
but that wasn't as popular as it later became in the and the aughts,
you know,

2090
01:57:45.991 --> 01:57:50.020
in the Zeros again,
I mean that that trend was coming around,
but like,
um,

2091
01:57:51.030 --> 01:57:53.950
I was just never curious to kind of alter my mind,
my will,

2092
01:57:53.990 --> 01:57:57.120
my partners and I started our first company.
We were sophomores in high school,

2093
01:57:57.270 --> 01:57:59.940
so I was like working,
I was like sort of goal oriented and then I was like,

2094
01:58:00.180 --> 01:58:04.650
I was raised to believe that like you go to school and then you go to college

2095
01:58:04.651 --> 01:58:08.010
and you know you and you had a car when I think it was my junior year when I had

2096
01:58:08.011 --> 01:58:09.000
friends in high school,

2097
01:58:09.001 --> 01:58:12.450
I had friends who are seniors and for the first time in my life I learned that

2098
01:58:12.451 --> 01:58:13.860
not everybody goes to college.

2099
01:58:13.860 --> 01:58:16.590
That was the first time I knew that because I was just raised to believe that

2100
01:58:16.591 --> 01:58:19.710
that's just the natural course of life.
I had friends who were,
like I said,

2101
01:58:19.711 --> 01:58:20.730
we're an arts high school.
We're going to go,

2102
01:58:20.910 --> 01:58:23.940
I'm going to New York and I'm going to be a dancer and I'm going to go to La and

2103
01:58:23.941 --> 01:58:27.160
I'm going to do,
and I was like for college.
And they're like,
not at all.

2104
01:58:27.170 --> 01:58:28.920
I'm gonna get an apartment,
but some fram.

2105
01:58:28.921 --> 01:58:32.340
And that was like a foreign concept to me.
So I was like the straight arrogant.

2106
01:58:32.400 --> 01:58:35.490
I was a kid who finally got the respect that we would sit around in a circle and

2107
01:58:35.491 --> 01:58:38.640
they'd be passing the joint and they would just pass it like around me.
You know,

2108
01:58:38.641 --> 01:58:42.070
they would know not to even when you're in a room.
Yeah,
we,

2109
01:58:42.071 --> 01:58:45.280
but we'd be like in a garage would be at a bat or,
but no,

2110
01:58:45.380 --> 01:58:47.980
usually we're in a back yard and usually we're in the back.

2111
01:58:48.010 --> 01:58:50.480
I'm sure I've gotten that second hand stolen.
Must have.

2112
01:58:50.920 --> 01:58:53.560
I've seen people get fucked up on weed,
but like,
like,

2113
01:58:53.920 --> 01:58:57.310
like have panic attacks in this room.

2114
01:59:00.690 --> 01:59:02.920
I didn't know.
I thought it was supposed to be like this chill high.

2115
01:59:02.921 --> 01:59:06.700
Like this mellow.
I,
Timothy leary had a great expression about weed,
uh,

2116
01:59:06.730 --> 01:59:09.190
not about a,
we'd rather about LSD,
that La,

2117
01:59:09.540 --> 01:59:14.540
that LSD a induces states of paranoia and psychosis and people that have never

2118
01:59:15.311 --> 01:59:20.200
tried it like that.
People are terrified of LSD.
And you know,

2119
01:59:20.201 --> 01:59:22.690
just the way the coke,
I mean,
like I told him I did coke,

2120
01:59:22.870 --> 01:59:26.110
you'd have to scrape me off the fucking ceiling with a shovel or like a rake or

2121
01:59:26.111 --> 01:59:29.170
something.
Cause I would just like,
I would just like be crazy.

2122
01:59:29.260 --> 01:59:32.890
Like this is how I am normally,
you know,
with some caffeine.
I just,
I was always,

2123
01:59:33.070 --> 01:59:34.630
I wasn't afraid.
I was always just like,

2124
01:59:34.690 --> 01:59:38.170
I'm not going to have a positive reaction to this.
And I,

2125
01:59:38.410 --> 01:59:40.720
and I don't know that the prohibition has ever been a deterrent because

2126
01:59:40.721 --> 01:59:45.340
obviously drugs are quite of readily available in,
in,
in Miami,

2127
01:59:45.570 --> 01:59:50.440
uh,
in particular,
believe it or not seen and still not as big of a coke scene.

2128
01:59:50.440 --> 01:59:53.140
But like Molly is,
you know,
a big now,
certainly we'd,

2129
01:59:53.230 --> 01:59:56.170
the biggest pond Molly is like the nicest people to be around.

2130
01:59:56.620 --> 01:59:59.440
The difference between people that are on Molly,
they want to rub you,

2131
01:59:59.730 --> 02:00:01.240
then want to come over and hold the hands of you,

2132
02:00:01.510 --> 02:00:05.010
the friendly that will hug the biggest concern.
Like shut the fuck up.

2133
02:00:05.060 --> 02:00:07.390
He's concerned.
He was like,
what are you actually ingesting?

2134
02:00:07.391 --> 02:00:09.550
Like who are you buying it from?
You?
What did they cut it with?

2135
02:00:09.620 --> 02:00:12.430
Which is the problem with the illegality.
Illegality.

2136
02:00:12.460 --> 02:00:15.160
The prohibition creates that.
The poison for sure man.

2137
02:00:15.570 --> 02:00:17.770
I mean all these fucking people that are smoking fake weed,

2138
02:00:17.771 --> 02:00:21.190
they're smoking this spice stuff and all this.
Oh it's awful for you.

2139
02:00:21.191 --> 02:00:22.900
You don't even know what you're adjusting your lungs.

2140
02:00:22.901 --> 02:00:26.150
Your body doesn't know what to do with it.
It's alien,
you know the,

2141
02:00:26.151 --> 02:00:28.810
the cannabinoid receptors.
Like what the fuck is this?
You know,

2142
02:00:28.811 --> 02:00:31.990
it's like the same argument against artificial sweeteners but to a much

2143
02:00:31.991 --> 02:00:32.800
heightened,

2144
02:00:32.800 --> 02:00:35.650
a much more heightened level because though the way it's interacting with your

2145
02:00:35.651 --> 02:00:39.540
mind,
it's,
you know,
I just think,
again,
I think it's,
it's,

2146
02:00:39.541 --> 02:00:43.180
it's traces marijuana prohibition.
It's like traces of this kind of like,

2147
02:00:43.330 --> 02:00:46.670
and we were talking about earlier,
this idea that you can't get past pass it.

2148
02:00:46.780 --> 02:00:49.790
If you objectively analyze,
we're talking about Trayvon Zimmerman,

2149
02:00:49.800 --> 02:00:52.300
you've just objectively analyze the facts of the situation.

2150
02:00:52.720 --> 02:00:55.770
There's really only one reality there and,
and it's,

2151
02:00:55.771 --> 02:00:57.220
it's incredible to me how people,

2152
02:00:57.370 --> 02:01:00.730
how race gets in the way of blocking their access to that reality.

2153
02:01:00.731 --> 02:01:02.290
But it seems to me the marijuana prohibition,

2154
02:01:02.500 --> 02:01:06.910
it's a plant that grows out of the earth that is less dangerous than poison ivy,

2155
02:01:06.940 --> 02:01:07.773
which is legal,

2156
02:01:07.780 --> 02:01:10.750
although I wouldn't smoke it or recommending it was real hard time being

2157
02:01:10.751 --> 02:01:14.350
objective about issues that are hot button issues.
You know,
whether it's drugs,

2158
02:01:14.351 --> 02:01:15.310
whether it's religion,

2159
02:01:15.340 --> 02:01:19.500
whether it's a that you have these drug dealers in lab coats at the,

2160
02:01:19.570 --> 02:01:23.860
at the local pharmacy.
Okay.
Who are killing children,
not them per,

2161
02:01:23.861 --> 02:01:27.880
but like these pharmaceutical companies were creating poisoned toxic chemicals

2162
02:01:28.030 --> 02:01:30.820
that people,
because a doctor writes you a prescription for it,

2163
02:01:31.720 --> 02:01:34.990
gleefully hand it to their wives,
their kids,
their parents.

2164
02:01:34.991 --> 02:01:36.740
Like that is a,

2165
02:01:36.770 --> 02:01:41.770
that is a mindset that's like ingrained us as a result of just like a life of,

2166
02:01:42.591 --> 02:01:47.030
of propaganda and,
and,
and just ma mind fucking,
I mean,
it just,

2167
02:01:47.150 --> 02:01:50.060
it's literally just brainwashing that you could think,
oh,

2168
02:01:50.720 --> 02:01:54.980
this plant that grows out of the ground,
you shouldn't roll that in.
Smoke it.

2169
02:01:55.100 --> 02:01:56.720
We do it with cigars,
we do it with cigarettes.

2170
02:01:56.780 --> 02:01:59.630
But as soon as you start adding crazy shit to it,

2171
02:01:59.631 --> 02:02:03.320
like nicotine or chemicals or that's,

2172
02:02:03.321 --> 02:02:05.680
that makes it legal because the FDA is to,
oh,
I don't,

2173
02:02:05.690 --> 02:02:08.270
I just don't understand stamps.
It says,
I mean alcohol,

2174
02:02:08.320 --> 02:02:11.830
one of the most devastating drugs.
So why are people okay with it by,

2175
02:02:11.850 --> 02:02:14.360
it's because people are okay with culture.

2176
02:02:14.630 --> 02:02:17.960
When culture is firmly established and you grow up in that environment,

2177
02:02:18.170 --> 02:02:22.480
it seems normal to put a fucking plate in your lips and stretch your lips out.

2178
02:02:22.550 --> 02:02:26.810
It seems normal to put a bone through your nose.
Why?
Because all the elders,

2179
02:02:26.811 --> 02:02:30.170
they have the scar effication on their face.
I'm going to get scarred up too.

2180
02:02:30.320 --> 02:02:31.490
I mean,
that's what everybody does.

2181
02:02:31.500 --> 02:02:35.420
It's or atmosphere to pay the government 25 cents to make a dime.

2182
02:02:35.600 --> 02:02:37.790
Like we were talking about earlier,

2183
02:02:37.791 --> 02:02:42.020
without laws about cops enforcing laws that are just essentially revenue

2184
02:02:42.021 --> 02:02:44.300
collecting laws and not protecting anybody from anything.

2185
02:02:44.330 --> 02:02:47.600
There was two kids at barely teenagers,
you know,

2186
02:02:47.601 --> 02:02:51.260
they had the snow day out east in Iowa with the blizzard a couple of weeks ago.

2187
02:02:51.680 --> 02:02:53.930
And so instead of sitting around dicking around at home,

2188
02:02:53.960 --> 02:02:56.510
because it wasn't nearly as bad as everyone thought it was going to be,

2189
02:02:56.840 --> 02:02:59.420
they decided instead of watching TV or playing video games,

2190
02:02:59.421 --> 02:03:02.930
right or no smoking the pot,
they said,
let's grab a couple of shovels,

2191
02:03:02.931 --> 02:03:07.700
go door to door and make five bucks and offered,
uh,
to clean people's,
you know,

2192
02:03:07.701 --> 02:03:12.620
to a driveways.
And the cops came because they got complaints.

2193
02:03:12.621 --> 02:03:16.020
The kids were knocking on doors or whatever,
I guess,
and stopped the,

2194
02:03:16.280 --> 02:03:21.110
they didn't have a proper permit offer offering their services.

2195
02:03:21.111 --> 02:03:24.110
I did that all throughout my childhood.
When I was a kid.

2196
02:03:24.111 --> 02:03:25.760
We would get psyched when it would snow.
Now,

2197
02:03:25.970 --> 02:03:29.060
me and my friends would go around the neighborhood and we shovel and we'd make

2198
02:03:29.061 --> 02:03:30.170
deals.
Do they shut down?

2199
02:03:30.171 --> 02:03:32.900
Lemonade stands now for not having proper permitting in licenses.

2200
02:03:32.960 --> 02:03:35.180
That's ridiculous.
And that's,
that's the,
the,

2201
02:03:35.181 --> 02:03:37.460
the revenue collecting aspect that we were talking about.

2202
02:03:37.461 --> 02:03:38.570
They're not about withholding.

2203
02:03:38.720 --> 02:03:43.010
Upholding the piece are protecting or serving New Jersey teens block from

2204
02:03:43.011 --> 02:03:47.120
shoveling snow without permit cunts.
That's all that is.

2205
02:03:47.690 --> 02:03:51.710
Jersey Jersey is a state where people can't even put your own gas for crying out

2206
02:03:51.711 --> 02:03:53.990
loud.
Does it say the cop's name so we could say it on the

2207
02:03:55.520 --> 02:04:00.520
police chief Michael Giannone told my Jersey central.com to two teens would not

2208
02:04:00.891 --> 02:04:02.270
arrested.
All issued a ticket.

2209
02:04:02.390 --> 02:04:07.390
But what stopped because the town was in a so called state of emergency in

2210
02:04:08.530 --> 02:04:13.010
adventure.
A comics dump.
Shut the fuck up.
Emergency Central Jersey.

2211
02:04:14.340 --> 02:04:15.860
Some burns.
That's my whole page.

2212
02:04:15.890 --> 02:04:20.480
That's where you can't shovel snow because it's going to be more snow out.
Yeah.

2213
02:04:20.481 --> 02:04:24.680
Good.
Good call fucking ass.
This is what you're saying about before.

2214
02:04:25.070 --> 02:04:28.420
These are the rules on the,
on the books for forcing.

2215
02:04:28.730 --> 02:04:30.420
They're not making up these laws.
The cops.

2216
02:04:30.421 --> 02:04:35.120
They're just prop a permit for shovel and there's a permit for helping pizza get

2217
02:04:35.121 --> 02:04:37.990
out of it.
Didn't or is that jersey?
Whatever it is.
If

2218
02:04:38.130 --> 02:04:42.570
<v 2>you'd shovel someone for free,
is that okay?
Oh,
it's just be exchange of money.</v>

2219
02:04:42.810 --> 02:04:44.390
You know?
That's what it is.
You,
you,
you,

2220
02:04:44.400 --> 02:04:48.210
you could go around the neighborhood is a good Samaritan.
Shovel everybody out,

2221
02:04:48.211 --> 02:04:50.130
but the cops were never a problem with that.
If you're not giving,

2222
02:04:50.131 --> 02:04:51.030
the government did.
Like I said,

2223
02:04:51.100 --> 02:04:54.360
if you're not paying the government 25 cents to make a dime because how much of

2224
02:04:54.361 --> 02:04:56.940
these kids going to make that they could go out and spend,
I don't know,

2225
02:04:56.941 --> 02:05:00.900
$300 on a permit so that for one day on a snow day when they're not at school,

2226
02:05:00.901 --> 02:05:03.830
they could go around and make five bucks a driveway.
Like it's unsafe.

2227
02:05:03.870 --> 02:05:06.210
Cops should investigate really hot women,

2228
02:05:06.211 --> 02:05:11.070
the date these old decrepit old men that are barely alive and they drive around

2229
02:05:11.080 --> 02:05:15.210
a rolls Royces and shit.
You should be like,
Ho Ho,
Ho,
Ho,
Ho.
Let's sit down.

2230
02:05:15.270 --> 02:05:17.820
Sit down.
Let's talk.
What do you,
what are you getting out of this?

2231
02:05:17.821 --> 02:05:22.100
You're getting money.
He give you that rolls.
I want 25% of that roles.
What?

2232
02:05:22.260 --> 02:05:25.500
That roles was worth.
$250,000 pay up hooker.

2233
02:05:25.530 --> 02:05:28.770
Why take 25% they can just use asset forfeiture and take the whole thing.
Yeah.

2234
02:05:28.771 --> 02:05:32.190
That girl is a whore.
She should give up that money.
Give up that fucking car.

2235
02:05:32.191 --> 02:05:35.210
Bitch.
You know,
you don't look that old man that sees it.

2236
02:05:35.310 --> 02:05:38.530
Like if you had like Anna Nicole Smith and her husband remember that piece

2237
02:05:38.820 --> 02:05:42.870
before he died.
Yeah.
Both of them.
Yeah.
Right.
She's dead too.
And that crazy.

2238
02:05:43.080 --> 02:05:44.040
But like,
I mean,

2239
02:05:44.070 --> 02:05:48.210
that was one of the more clear examples of public prostitution.

2240
02:05:48.360 --> 02:05:53.360
You're ever gonna see a billionaire j Howard Marshall and a big pride hooker.

2241
02:05:54.210 --> 02:05:56.370
I mean,
that's,
that's what it was.
And you,

2242
02:05:56.371 --> 02:06:00.170
you have one that's profiting off of the other.
When you go to the,
uh,

2243
02:06:00.480 --> 02:06:03.180
the seminal hard rock and Hollywood,
Florida at the Improv,
you don't,

2244
02:06:03.210 --> 02:06:05.730
you don't stay in the end,
in a kol sweet.
There's an anarchist.
Sweet.

2245
02:06:05.790 --> 02:06:09.480
She died there.
Oh,
that's,
there's ghosts.

2246
02:06:09.890 --> 02:06:10.950
Ghosts of favorite cities.

2247
02:06:10.980 --> 02:06:14.220
There was a rumor the Seminoles would never confirm this but there was,

2248
02:06:14.670 --> 02:06:17.960
there was a rumor that they actually sent like a witch doctor or like something

2249
02:06:18.710 --> 02:06:23.160
to like to kind of go spa di poltergeist or whatever.

2250
02:06:23.161 --> 02:06:25.950
The room and then they like completely redid the room.

2251
02:06:25.951 --> 02:06:27.800
Changed the number like that.
That's the room.
No,

2252
02:06:27.870 --> 02:06:31.710
they would never come that dotted or confirm that she was so dumb.

2253
02:06:31.711 --> 02:06:35.790
I better ghost would be too stupid to haunt me buddy.
I bet her ghost be like,

2254
02:06:35.920 --> 02:06:40.770
oop,
no boo.
Ooh Fuck it.
I quit.

2255
02:06:41.070 --> 02:06:44.610
It goes from just take naps or ghost,
just take naps and do pills.

2256
02:06:44.850 --> 02:06:48.600
Imagine if he just,
he saw a ghost of like a fat chick eating pills on the couch.

2257
02:06:48.720 --> 02:06:51.060
Like it's like such a nonthreatening ghost.

2258
02:06:52.570 --> 02:06:54.780
Especially like on seminal land.
It'd be like,

2259
02:06:55.200 --> 02:07:00.080
she would be like the least scary ghost and like Indian burial ground about
that.

2260
02:07:00.180 --> 02:07:03.330
You're talking about native Americans are not just persecuted but they were in

2261
02:07:03.360 --> 02:07:04.081
genocide,

2262
02:07:04.081 --> 02:07:09.081
was committed upon their people and as a compensation they were given swats of

2263
02:07:09.691 --> 02:07:12.980
language.
Are they going to open up casinos?
I mean,
it's mad.

2264
02:07:13.380 --> 02:07:14.690
I said the Indian casinos are,

2265
02:07:15.100 --> 02:07:18.720
the payment saying is the house always wins like Indian casinos,

2266
02:07:18.721 --> 02:07:22.200
the only casino where the house never wins because no matter how much money you

2267
02:07:22.201 --> 02:07:25.500
lose,
we still rape their women and stole their country.
So it's like,

2268
02:07:25.770 --> 02:07:26.820
call it reparations,

2269
02:07:26.821 --> 02:07:29.700
like sit down at the one arm bandit and lose some money for crying out loud.

2270
02:07:29.860 --> 02:07:33.870
Like it's,
it's,
it's but meaning,
but what's interesting is it like now,

2271
02:07:34.390 --> 02:07:37.390
and this might be a,
this might go to you to,
to your earlier point,

2272
02:07:37.420 --> 02:07:39.760
that it's Affluenza.
There's,

2273
02:07:40.240 --> 02:07:43.480
they're like no native Americans that work at these casinos anymore.

2274
02:07:43.840 --> 02:07:47.330
They sit at home,
get the check every month from the,

2275
02:07:47.331 --> 02:07:51.730
the revenue and now they're hiring white boys to wrestle out alligators and like

2276
02:07:51.731 --> 02:07:53.790
do all that.
Like,
you know,
the,
the Indian cultural,

2277
02:07:53.800 --> 02:07:57.280
native American rather cultural shit.
And there's no,

2278
02:07:57.550 --> 02:07:59.800
no Indians and an Indian casino anymore.

2279
02:07:59.830 --> 02:08:03.160
They're all just kind of living off the fat of the land and getting their checks

2280
02:08:03.161 --> 02:08:06.220
and not incentivized to motivate or,
or,
or do anything.

2281
02:08:06.221 --> 02:08:10.210
And you see higher rates of alcoholism,
of drug abuse and,

2282
02:08:10.211 --> 02:08:14.370
and they're just sitting around,
you know,
getting checks and,
and,
and,
and,
and uh,

2283
02:08:14.700 --> 02:08:15.910
and a lot of them are dying.

2284
02:08:15.940 --> 02:08:18.730
Well that's always been an issue on native American reservations,
right?

2285
02:08:18.731 --> 02:08:21.820
Alcoholism.
Absolutely.
Depression,
drug abuse,
depression.

2286
02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.310
I mean their culture was stolen.

2287
02:08:24.490 --> 02:08:28.780
I mean it's like essentially they're wiped out except for a few survivors who

2288
02:08:28.781 --> 02:08:33.580
are then forced to assimilate and there's new strange culture and then made

2289
02:08:33.581 --> 02:08:35.620
aware of it painfully every step of the way.

2290
02:08:35.621 --> 02:08:37.480
And when you're growing up that you were,

2291
02:08:37.481 --> 02:08:42.350
you're the loser in this cultural genocide attack and this,
these are the people,

2292
02:08:42.410 --> 02:08:45.180
those are unconquered they always reminded us,
they always say,
well,

2293
02:08:45.190 --> 02:08:47.380
the Seminoles actually do a lot of good things.

2294
02:08:47.410 --> 02:08:50.720
They use that money and a lot of good ways.
And they're,
they,

2295
02:08:50.780 --> 02:08:53.080
they support a lot of charities like that,

2296
02:08:53.081 --> 02:08:56.170
that tribe and Florida is responsible for a lot of good things.
You'd,

2297
02:08:56.171 --> 02:08:58.850
they bought one of the most American brands,
the hardware,

2298
02:08:59.090 --> 02:09:03.250
like talk about the ultimate fuck you.
Like we own the hard rock,

2299
02:09:03.260 --> 02:09:07.580
but I'm not,
that was me.
I'm like,
what a great,
great thing.
That club too.

2300
02:09:07.581 --> 02:09:10.920
I work at the club every time I'm down there.
I prefer that club over the,

2301
02:09:10.950 --> 02:09:14.080
the bigger one in West Palm,
which I get more money on.
I like,

2302
02:09:14.081 --> 02:09:17.650
it's like a more intimate environment I find go there and I sacrifice a little

2303
02:09:17.651 --> 02:09:19.150
money and I have a better time sometimes.

2304
02:09:19.151 --> 02:09:22.300
Like my girlfriend was doing a project for school a few months ago and it was

2305
02:09:22.301 --> 02:09:27.301
about the appropriation of native American culture and how it's one of the few

2306
02:09:28.960 --> 02:09:32.860
races where it's still okay.
It's the whole red skins phenomenon,
you know,

2307
02:09:32.861 --> 02:09:37.861
like how it's still okay to be racist and to create kind of like Minstrel esque

2308
02:09:38.201 --> 02:09:41.980
images of their children dressed in skins like India can Redskins.

2309
02:09:42.040 --> 02:09:44.620
That's like having the n word.
That's the equivalent,

2310
02:09:44.650 --> 02:09:46.360
but people don't look at it that way.

2311
02:09:46.540 --> 02:09:49.060
I just don't understand how they don't just change the name.

2312
02:09:49.240 --> 02:09:51.220
It's not a difficult thing and do it.
Look,

2313
02:09:51.221 --> 02:09:54.870
if you want to honor native Americans and somehow or another keep like that,

2314
02:09:54.940 --> 02:09:59.320
you can just change the name,
you know,
call it you,
you could call it whatever.

2315
02:09:59.440 --> 02:10:02.530
I mean there's people that call it the warrior's.
So the Golden State Warriors,

2316
02:10:02.560 --> 02:10:04.180
right?
Like there no ones have,
no,

2317
02:10:04.181 --> 02:10:06.730
I don't think if they do have an issue with that,
they're being silly.
Yeah.

2318
02:10:06.760 --> 02:10:09.670
Cause that's an honorables.
I mean that's like you're,
you're,

2319
02:10:09.671 --> 02:10:14.671
you're being proud of what these people were at their finest are at their most

2320
02:10:14.771 --> 02:10:17.490
noble and powerful,
still get offended by the mascot tree though know.

2321
02:10:18.050 --> 02:10:20.000
And that's a real kind of like,

2322
02:10:20.050 --> 02:10:23.920
like white guilt moment for me because I'm a rights activists to get offended by

2323
02:10:23.921 --> 02:10:27.370
any mascots.
You're always going to have some people that are ridiculous,

2324
02:10:27.371 --> 02:10:30.790
but red skin is a little weird man.
It's like,

2325
02:10:30.791 --> 02:10:33.890
I didn't really think about it that way,
but it's incredibly offensive.

2326
02:10:34.130 --> 02:10:38.570
<v 1>Yeah.
I saw,
yeah,
I saw it earlier.
That's offensive.
You fuck wild thing.</v>

2327
02:10:38.720 --> 02:10:42.170
Good worthwhile thing.
Yeah.
I just,
I wasn't,

2328
02:10:42.230 --> 02:10:43.790
that was something I was completely,

2329
02:10:43.791 --> 02:10:46.490
I don't want to say it was insensitive to it.
It's just kind of unaware of it.

2330
02:10:46.730 --> 02:10:47.940
And then she starts doing this like pow,

2331
02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:51.980
this whole PowerPoint on it actually starts going and getting like racist

2332
02:10:51.981 --> 02:10:56.060
iconography through through the years,
particularly in the south and from,

2333
02:10:56.090 --> 02:10:59.300
you know,
we're in Miami and Florida and like,
and I was like,

2334
02:10:59.570 --> 02:11:00.470
and she was kind of putting them,

2335
02:11:00.471 --> 02:11:05.120
she was doing side by side comparisons to like classic,
you know,

2336
02:11:05.121 --> 02:11:09.990
pre civil rights era,
racist advertising and uh,
you know,

2337
02:11:10.030 --> 02:11:10.240
and,

2338
02:11:10.240 --> 02:11:15.240
and posters and imagery in art and then contemporary native American depictions

2339
02:11:15.780 --> 02:11:20.660
left and right.
And I'm like,
Oh shit.
I was like,
yeah,
how can we not see that?

2340
02:11:20.661 --> 02:11:25.300
That's like,
that was that,
that,
that racist,
you know,
a,
a black,
you know,
the,
the,

2341
02:11:25.301 --> 02:11:29.300
the,
the,
the black cartoon face with the great big lip seeding a watermelon.

2342
02:11:29.510 --> 02:11:33.900
That was okay once you can advertise your store or your product,
answer mine,

2343
02:11:33.901 --> 02:11:35.060
mine,
that kind of Shit.
Yeah.

2344
02:11:35.270 --> 02:11:40.270
And then she's got the same exact or reminiscent imagery,

2345
02:11:40.670 --> 02:11:43.550
but from like contemporary ads and cattle,
again,

2346
02:11:43.640 --> 02:11:48.230
kids dressed up is as Indians and what the fate with the war paint and the head

2347
02:11:48.231 --> 02:11:50.000
dress.
And,
and,
and the kind of,

2348
02:11:50.200 --> 02:11:55.170
and kind of comparing that to modern day a a minstrel.
And I'm like,
that's fast.

2349
02:11:55.171 --> 02:11:57.410
And like I just never thought about it that way.

2350
02:11:57.530 --> 02:11:59.270
And then privilege as a white man,

2351
02:11:59.271 --> 02:12:02.390
I started to feel a whole fucking bad about it again.
And I'm like,

2352
02:12:02.391 --> 02:12:03.171
I'm the asshole.

2353
02:12:03.171 --> 02:12:06.590
I never thought about this before and I'm an asshole for never having kids.

2354
02:12:06.740 --> 02:12:09.770
But like Redskins,
he's like,
I'm seeing it.
I'm actually going like,
oh shit.

2355
02:12:09.771 --> 02:12:10.730
Should I be saying the r word?

2356
02:12:10.731 --> 02:12:15.430
Like I'm actually now in that headspace because of white guilt.
Yes.

2357
02:12:16.180 --> 02:12:20.090
It's definitely not necessary.
I mean,
look,

2358
02:12:20.091 --> 02:12:23.660
you could still have the same exact team,
the same exact athletes,

2359
02:12:23.661 --> 02:12:27.920
the same exact pride and just let's get together and have a contest to come up

2360
02:12:27.921 --> 02:12:29.240
with a new name and you would,

2361
02:12:29.241 --> 02:12:32.120
you would get people that would be so happy about and the publicity from that

2362
02:12:32.121 --> 02:12:36.470
contest to look.
And I'm like,
we're going to keep it out of tradition.

2363
02:12:36.471 --> 02:12:38.060
And because our fans aren't offended by,

2364
02:12:38.061 --> 02:12:40.640
it's like we had slavery out of tradition.

2365
02:12:40.850 --> 02:12:43.090
For one thing,

2366
02:12:43.170 --> 02:12:47.300
a black lady that looks like a slave on the cover of their,
yes.

2367
02:12:47.301 --> 02:12:50.810
Jesus fucking Christ.
How's that happening?
That's,
that's the thing.
Well,

2368
02:12:50.840 --> 02:12:54.320
I catch him.
I'm a doc.
I think she's,
I think she's the woman who,
uh,

2369
02:12:54.350 --> 02:12:59.210
who actually created the,
the citizen,
but she's a lovely,
she's different.

2370
02:12:59.480 --> 02:13:01.960
She's not all dressed like the main,
like the mammy,
like the maid.

2371
02:13:01.960 --> 02:13:04.360
And she likes to be a mammy though.
Oh yeah.
Oh,

2372
02:13:04.370 --> 02:13:05.660
it was like right out of antebellum south.

2373
02:13:05.661 --> 02:13:10.070
It was like a gone with the wind character.
Absolutely.
Yeah.
And,
and uh,

2374
02:13:11.550 --> 02:13:15.710
yeah,
she's lovely.
She's a lovely working woman.
She has regular hair now too.

2375
02:13:15.711 --> 02:13:17.690
She used to have that Bandanna over a hair.
Well,

2376
02:13:17.691 --> 02:13:22.220
she wouldn't get her dirty hair and the white man's food.
Yeah.

2377
02:13:22.221 --> 02:13:25.820
This is what she used to look like,
man.
Good Lord.

2378
02:13:26.690 --> 02:13:29.710
Oh my God.
Your Mama used to look like a slave.
That's why.

2379
02:13:29.870 --> 02:13:31.200
That's why the updated Wendy,
you know,

2380
02:13:31.350 --> 02:13:35.300
cause the ginger protest movement was trying to get Wendy of Wendy's.
No,

2381
02:13:35.301 --> 02:13:40.160
I'm just,
oh,
but I,
but the right heads,
not the Redskins with the red.
Well,

2382
02:13:40.170 --> 02:13:43.410
that's what I'm wondering.
I'm wondering like are we,
at what point is,
does it be,

2383
02:13:43.450 --> 02:13:45.540
are we veering into political correctness?

2384
02:13:45.630 --> 02:13:50.550
I think the red skins thing is tooth going too far.
I really believe that.

2385
02:13:50.760 --> 02:13:52.320
You mean in a,
in a negative way.

2386
02:13:54.280 --> 02:13:56.790
I don't think we're being overly sensitive is what I'm saying.
No,

2387
02:13:56.791 --> 02:13:58.710
I don't think so.
No,
I think it's fucked up.

2388
02:13:59.010 --> 02:14:02.250
I think if you were a native American it would be a huge issue.

2389
02:14:02.850 --> 02:14:04.950
It would be very much like,
you know,

2390
02:14:04.951 --> 02:14:09.390
if you had the fucking San Francisco guineas,

2391
02:14:09.690 --> 02:14:14.640
you know the mascot was a fucking Italian guy with a hairy chest and gold chains

2392
02:14:14.641 --> 02:14:17.100
looking stupid with pasta stains on his shirt would be jersey.

2393
02:14:17.101 --> 02:14:19.160
That would be San Francisco.
Well,
you know,

2394
02:14:20.250 --> 02:14:22.470
there's a lot of guineas in San Francisco,
believe it or not.
Really?

2395
02:14:22.620 --> 02:14:25.990
Is that a thing?
Is there,
is there like a little Italy?
Is there like one of the,

2396
02:14:26.070 --> 02:14:28.560
yeah,
there's a lot of Italian people in San Francisco,

2397
02:14:28.790 --> 02:14:31.480
so I was just going to sound fucking amazing.
Italian food.
Yes.

2398
02:14:31.670 --> 02:14:34.230
Pam on Columbus Avenue right here.
Getting some of my life.

2399
02:14:34.350 --> 02:14:37.530
They're very good Chinese food but very good Italian food to San Francisco is

2400
02:14:37.531 --> 02:14:38.830
really good there.

2401
02:14:38.840 --> 02:14:42.160
There's some jam in Italian restaurants we eat at every time we worked there.

2402
02:14:42.180 --> 02:14:45.270
I was complaining about have you ever driven in San Francisco is treacherous

2403
02:14:45.300 --> 02:14:49.260
dude,
these fucking treacherous,
easy,
well grew up in Boston son.
Oh yeah.

2404
02:14:49.261 --> 02:14:53.220
I grew up in Miami,
grew up on black ice sea level.
We're at sea level.

2405
02:14:53.221 --> 02:14:54.300
There's no hint that you know,

2406
02:14:54.301 --> 02:14:56.970
the highest elevation in the state is mount Trashmore.
It's a,

2407
02:14:56.971 --> 02:15:01.450
it's a landfill that is the highest elevation.
How and appropriately,
uh,

2408
02:15:01.530 --> 02:15:03.480
when they did that movie rock of ages,
that was the hot,

2409
02:15:03.500 --> 02:15:06.360
they put the Hollywood sign,
I'm out.
Sure.
That's where they did funding.

2410
02:15:06.400 --> 02:15:07.180
We say in Florida,

2411
02:15:07.180 --> 02:15:09.810
the only thing you can't really recreate is like mountains and snow.
But,

2412
02:15:09.870 --> 02:15:12.060
but they found a way to do it.
I met,
I don't know how high it is,

2413
02:15:12.061 --> 02:15:14.310
but that's the highest point of elevation in Florida.

2414
02:15:14.311 --> 02:15:16.980
It's all trash mount Trashmore it's a landfill that they're just,
yeah,

2415
02:15:16.981 --> 02:15:19.680
they're just piling on.
But,
but I grew up,

2416
02:15:19.950 --> 02:15:22.500
when I went to San Francisco was the scariest thing in my eye.

2417
02:15:22.530 --> 02:15:25.890
What we were actually doing cocaine cowboys to hustling with the godmother in,

2418
02:15:25.891 --> 02:15:30.180
in,
uh,
in Oakland,
in Brookfield village.
And I had to,

2419
02:15:30.240 --> 02:15:33.840
I had to drive the equipment truck back and return the equipment at the end of

2420
02:15:33.841 --> 02:15:36.660
that shoot.
So I'm driving in this great big truck with like,
I dunno,

2421
02:15:36.690 --> 02:15:39.480
untold thousands of dollars worth of equipment that I've got to return to this

2422
02:15:39.481 --> 02:15:42.990
house.
And I was just petrified.
Why?
Cause I was like,

2423
02:15:43.260 --> 02:15:47.220
I was like looking straight.
Oh,
the hill hills dude.

2424
02:15:47.400 --> 02:15:49.380
Did you ever see bullet with Steve Mcqueen?
Of course.

2425
02:15:49.410 --> 02:15:53.940
I watched it again a couple of weeks or a couple of months ago.
Uh,
it was a,

2426
02:15:53.941 --> 02:15:57.330
a trip in Canada and I was watching it with a friend who had never seen it

2427
02:15:57.331 --> 02:15:59.820
before.
I was like,
dude,
you're in front God damn treat.

2428
02:15:59.850 --> 02:16:03.570
This is a real American movie and it's also a movie where there's very little

2429
02:16:03.571 --> 02:16:07.410
dialogue.
It's a great movie man.
Bullet with Steve McQueen's,
a great muscle.

2430
02:16:07.411 --> 02:16:11.820
Seventies were like the last golden age of American cinema.
There was,

2431
02:16:11.821 --> 02:16:15.750
when she got real front,
when Shit got real there were definitely different.

2432
02:16:15.780 --> 02:16:18.810
It was a completely different style of making a movie.

2433
02:16:18.811 --> 02:16:22.410
Back then you didn't have to have music and every God damn scene,
you know,

2434
02:16:22.411 --> 02:16:26.520
you had some real moments,
gritty,
gritty,
gritty,
gritty,
gritty and like,

2435
02:16:26.640 --> 02:16:28.670
and I think they were just coming out of,
of,
you know,

2436
02:16:28.680 --> 02:16:33.070
the 60s with that transition where in terms of censorship where you could start

2437
02:16:33.370 --> 02:16:33.761
getting a,

2438
02:16:33.761 --> 02:16:37.780
what you start pushing the envelope in the 60s by the 70s there was no envelope

2439
02:16:37.781 --> 02:16:41.860
anymore and just mainstream cinema,
you can do practically anything.

2440
02:16:42.250 --> 02:16:45.130
And they did.
And so you,
you,
you had,

2441
02:16:45.131 --> 02:16:47.650
and that wasn't just in terms of like a sex and violence,

2442
02:16:47.651 --> 02:16:51.220
but in terms of the reality and the grittiness of the stories and the
characters,

2443
02:16:51.221 --> 02:16:53.590
it'd be shit became really dirty.
Harry.

2444
02:16:53.680 --> 02:16:57.010
Like those early dirty Harry movies are like brutal,

2445
02:16:58.000 --> 02:16:58.833
but they're dumb.

2446
02:16:59.470 --> 02:17:02.980
The difference between that and like bullet bullet is a brilliant movie.

2447
02:17:03.010 --> 02:17:07.030
It's like the people that are in it,
they're great actors.
It feels real.
You know,

2448
02:17:07.031 --> 02:17:10.810
like there's some dirty hairy moments where you're like,
go ahead,
make my day.

2449
02:17:10.880 --> 02:17:14.260
I come on Fuck Outta here.
Crazy asshole.
No,

2450
02:17:14.490 --> 02:17:18.070
it's like they're fun,
but you know,
it's a fun movie to watch,

2451
02:17:18.071 --> 02:17:20.800
but it doesn't give you a feeling like you're actually watching something that

2452
02:17:20.801 --> 02:17:24.220
could actually be taken place.
But it's brutal.
It is brutal.
Yeah.
Man.

2453
02:17:24.240 --> 02:17:28.960
It was just raw death.
Wish to see the first one.
Yeah.
Charles Bronson,
man.
Yeah.

2454
02:17:28.961 --> 02:17:31.570
The first one,
not so much.
Well,
there's,
yeah,
those,

2455
02:17:31.690 --> 02:17:35.470
they start selling on his face started getting fatter.
He starts again.

2456
02:17:35.471 --> 02:17:38.850
I make cocaine cowboys to hustle.
The God mother.
I can't complain about one man.

2457
02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:40.450
I mean,
the,
you parked to stand.

2458
02:17:40.680 --> 02:17:45.680
Why the cocaine cowboys to keep apologizing for that cocaine cowboys one you

2459
02:17:46.871 --> 02:17:50.140
have no apologies.
Right?
No,
I mean,
there's certainly things I do differently.

2460
02:17:50.141 --> 02:17:54.390
We got to do cocaine cowboys,
reloaded,
which was great.
Uh,
you know,
no,

2461
02:17:54.400 --> 02:17:55.730
there was nothing wrong with it.
Um,

2462
02:17:56.050 --> 02:17:59.140
did someone forced you to call it hustling with the godmother?
Is that what's up?

2463
02:17:59.230 --> 02:18:00.010
I think it's,

2464
02:18:00.010 --> 02:18:02.200
I think what happens is you have a lot of temporary working titles that just

2465
02:18:02.201 --> 02:18:04.690
stick.
Like our first doc,
we did this,
it's nothing wrong with it.

2466
02:18:04.720 --> 02:18:07.150
We did this dot called raw deal,
a question of consent.

2467
02:18:07.210 --> 02:18:10.510
And that was raw deal was just our working title and it was about the alleged

2468
02:18:10.511 --> 02:18:14.110
rape of a stripper at the Delta Chi Fraternity House at the University of

2469
02:18:14.111 --> 02:18:14.980
Florida in Gainesville.

2470
02:18:15.160 --> 02:18:19.360
And the spring of 99 and the entire night's events are captured on two video

2471
02:18:19.361 --> 02:18:20.194
cameras.

2472
02:18:20.320 --> 02:18:24.280
And so we use the video footage and then we interview the stripper and we

2473
02:18:24.281 --> 02:18:26.620
interviewed some of the fraternity men.
So the thing about the,

2474
02:18:26.740 --> 02:18:28.050
the footage is that,
um,

2475
02:18:28.210 --> 02:18:31.210
it was placed in the public record of some of these very liberal public record

2476
02:18:31.211 --> 02:18:32.290
laws we have in Florida.

2477
02:18:32.291 --> 02:18:35.650
So it was placed in the public record and it became like the cost Leben

2478
02:18:35.650 --> 02:18:37.810
Gainesville,
Gainesville is a small town,
so there was still live there.

2479
02:18:38.170 --> 02:18:39.370
Did you really live there?

2480
02:18:39.371 --> 02:18:43.720
When I was a little kid between the age of seven and 11 I lived in Gainesville

2481
02:18:44.800 --> 02:18:48.310
county resident going to the University of Florida,
so I was down there.

2482
02:18:48.340 --> 02:18:52.660
I used to go to Lake Alice and Crockett or the alligators marshmallows before

2483
02:18:52.661 --> 02:18:56.500
they made it.
Yeah.
Well they were in the Ocala national forest.

2484
02:18:56.750 --> 02:18:59.800
You might be familiar.
And they were doing a big brother,

2485
02:18:59.801 --> 02:19:02.980
little brother pledge event.
I didn't rush.
I'm not,
I wasn't,

2486
02:19:02.990 --> 02:19:04.600
it wasn't in the Greek world,
but good for you.

2487
02:19:04.630 --> 02:19:07.750
Some ritual where there there's a bonfire.
I don't know what the hell is.

2488
02:19:07.751 --> 02:19:11.290
Anything that needs to be boycotted.
Boycott that showed kids enough.

2489
02:19:11.710 --> 02:19:13.890
That'd be your own fucking man.
Quick flash forward.

2490
02:19:14.310 --> 02:19:17.020
We premiered at Sundance film fest one then later went to the Edinburgh film

2491
02:19:17.021 --> 02:19:19.120
fest where it's like the,
it's like the Sundance of Europe and like,

2492
02:19:19.180 --> 02:19:21.760
so we go to Edinburgh and all the questions,

2493
02:19:22.090 --> 02:19:23.690
which is kind of interesting because most of the questions,

2494
02:19:23.691 --> 02:19:26.080
and Erica were about this,
this controversy,
which we'll get into in a minute,

2495
02:19:26.081 --> 02:19:28.130
but all,
almost all the questions

2496
02:19:28.130 --> 02:19:30.890
<v 3>in Edinburgh were about what the hell the Greek system is.</v>

2497
02:19:30.891 --> 02:19:34.460
They don't have it there,
so they were completely,
this was like a total,

2498
02:19:34.640 --> 02:19:37.550
it was a nat Geo doc for them.
They were like,
what is this green?
You know,

2499
02:19:37.551 --> 02:19:40.810
like what is the attorneys and I'm like the least qualified person to be at,

2500
02:19:40.811 --> 02:19:42.590
you know to we talk about that.
Then when you go to,

2501
02:19:42.860 --> 02:19:46.790
when you go to the University of Miami,
which I did and I was a Miami Guy,

2502
02:19:46.791 --> 02:19:51.530
like you don't need to,
for the,
for social interaction,

2503
02:19:51.531 --> 02:19:55.040
you don't need a club like you might need to do in Gainsville or Tallahassee or

2504
02:19:55.041 --> 02:19:58.030
these college towns,
these insulated college towns where you're,

2505
02:19:58.040 --> 02:20:00.290
the social environment is very kind of restricted.

2506
02:20:00.850 --> 02:20:04.790
This hazing and all the fucking crib,
dude,

2507
02:20:04.791 --> 02:20:08.270
fuck all that's creepy.
So they're hazing these kids or whatever.
This ritual,

2508
02:20:08.390 --> 02:20:11.180
the big brother,
little brother,
pledge ritual out in the forest.

2509
02:20:11.330 --> 02:20:14.420
They go back to the,
to the,
to the fraternity house to the common area,

2510
02:20:14.421 --> 02:20:17.120
and they have two strippers that they hired to come and perform.

2511
02:20:17.630 --> 02:20:19.370
One of the strippers leaves after the show,

2512
02:20:19.550 --> 02:20:22.310
one of the strippers goes back to for a private party with some of the

2513
02:20:22.311 --> 02:20:24.770
fraternity men,
uh,
come the dawn,

2514
02:20:24.800 --> 02:20:27.240
she goes running to a neighboring fraternity house.
Her Grant,

2515
02:20:27.300 --> 02:20:29.810
a grandmother was actually a house mom of one of the,

2516
02:20:29.900 --> 02:20:32.650
she thought this was the house that her mother or grandmother worked at.

2517
02:20:32.651 --> 02:20:33.021
It wasn't,

2518
02:20:33.021 --> 02:20:35.870
but she's wearing nothing but a t shirt that belong to one of the fraternity men

2519
02:20:35.871 --> 02:20:38.750
coming up to about her belly button and banging on the door of this neighboring

2520
02:20:38.751 --> 02:20:39.920
house saying that she had been raped.

2521
02:20:39.921 --> 02:20:43.100
And she told the university police department that they had videotaped it and

2522
02:20:43.101 --> 02:20:45.500
they go and get the videotape footage and spoiler alert,

2523
02:20:45.920 --> 02:20:49.850
watch one of the two videotapes and arrest of the stripper for filing a false

2524
02:20:49.851 --> 02:20:53.810
police report based on the videotape footage.
And as a result of that,

2525
02:20:54.350 --> 02:20:56.850
one of the two videos,
one of the two videos,
what about the second video?

2526
02:20:56.851 --> 02:20:59.480
I didn't care,
but there's a second video saying an actual rape.

2527
02:20:59.730 --> 02:21:02.480
The second videotape,
as it turns out,
was just coverage of,

2528
02:21:02.540 --> 02:21:06.680
it was like eight Cam B Cam.
So the second videotape doesn't show that much more.

2529
02:21:06.920 --> 02:21:11.050
It just shows alternate angles of the same action rather than,
but so,

2530
02:21:11.250 --> 02:21:13.190
so what happens is there's now a misdemeanor filing,

2531
02:21:13.191 --> 02:21:17.570
a false police report case against this woman.
And as a result,
the media says,

2532
02:21:17.571 --> 02:21:20.150
well,
we want to see,
this is evidence in a criminal case.

2533
02:21:20.330 --> 02:21:22.830
Her lawyer argues that under rape shield laws,

2534
02:21:22.831 --> 02:21:25.940
that her identity should be protected in her,
uh,
in this video tape put,

2535
02:21:25.941 --> 02:21:27.680
it should be to protect you because it depicts a rape.

2536
02:21:27.890 --> 02:21:30.620
A judge viewed the footage and says,
this ain't no rape.

2537
02:21:31.130 --> 02:21:34.460
And they release the footage to the public and they're in there becomes,

2538
02:21:34.550 --> 02:21:37.580
there's a backlog at the state attorney's office and the clerk of courts there,

2539
02:21:37.880 --> 02:21:40.180
cause there's like,
they're like making copies,

2540
02:21:40.200 --> 02:21:42.710
the video tape and sending it to people.
So in Gainesville,

2541
02:21:42.711 --> 02:21:45.080
if you were the first person on your block to get the tape,

2542
02:21:45.470 --> 02:21:47.840
what they called the rape tape,
you'd have a kegger.

2543
02:21:47.900 --> 02:21:50.800
People would invite friends over to their house.
And they too,

2544
02:21:50.970 --> 02:21:53.330
cause you were the first person to get in.
Everybody wanted to see it.

2545
02:21:53.870 --> 02:21:57.560
So what happens is like
growing up in Miami,
you got friends of course,

2546
02:21:57.561 --> 02:21:59.440
who go to Gainesville,
go to Tallahassee.
And I'll go to the,

2547
02:21:59.600 --> 02:22:01.010
the two major state schools of course,

2548
02:22:01.011 --> 02:22:05.150
only in Florida to our two flagship state schools where they both,
uh,
uh,

2549
02:22:05.210 --> 02:22:07.520
targets of major serial killers,

2550
02:22:07.580 --> 02:22:10.880
Ted Bundy and Tallahassee and Danny Rollin and university of fluid only in

2551
02:22:10.881 --> 02:22:15.260
Florida.
Um,
and so we hear from a friend,
so I'll never forget this,

2552
02:22:15.261 --> 02:22:17.600
as long as I live,
we hear from one of our friends and we grew up,

2553
02:22:18.050 --> 02:22:22.670
same neighborhood.
I say that same upbringing,
white middle class Jewish kids.

2554
02:22:22.790 --> 02:22:27.690
I see that to say we had similar kind of life and come come at things with a not

2555
02:22:27.691 --> 02:22:32.400
dissimilar worldview.
So they said,
did you hear this is like summer of 99 by now?

2556
02:22:32.401 --> 02:22:32.731
And they're like,

2557
02:22:32.731 --> 02:22:35.060
did you hear about this case with Delta Chi and the stripper and the video?

2558
02:22:35.080 --> 02:22:38.310
I said,
yeah,
yeah.
I read about it and,
and they're like,

2559
02:22:38.311 --> 02:22:42.500
I just saw the videotape at a friend's house.
I was like,
well,
what happened?
And,

2560
02:22:42.510 --> 02:22:47.070
and my friends like,
he's like,
it was disgusting what they do to this poor woman.

2561
02:22:47.460 --> 02:22:49.650
Like I haven't been able to eat or sleep for days.

2562
02:22:49.680 --> 02:22:52.020
It's horrible what they put her through,
how they talked to her,

2563
02:22:52.130 --> 02:22:53.820
how they put her down,
how they hold her down.

2564
02:22:53.820 --> 02:22:56.720
She's tried kicking and trying to get away and I can't believe they haven't

2565
02:22:56.730 --> 02:22:59.520
arrested these guys and it's just,
I'm just completely distraught over it.

2566
02:23:00.060 --> 02:23:03.150
And then days later I hear from another buddy again.
We all grew up together.

2567
02:23:03.180 --> 02:23:06.510
Same store,
same grip.
He,
I said,
what?
I said,
he said,

2568
02:23:06.511 --> 02:23:08.340
did you hear about their lives?
Of course you saw,
I just heard,
yeah,

2569
02:23:08.341 --> 02:23:12.420
he's like this lying slut.
I was,

2570
02:23:12.421 --> 02:23:16.170
she's screwing around with all these guys and then she cries rape.

2571
02:23:16.171 --> 02:23:20.640
They should lock her up and throw away the key.
And I'm like,
what on earth?

2572
02:23:20.880 --> 02:23:24.300
You have to,
did you see the tape before this?
No,
not before this.

2573
02:23:24.301 --> 02:23:28.470
I'd only heard about it from these guys.
And I'm like two reasonable educated,

2574
02:23:28.471 --> 02:23:29.610
similar demo.

2575
02:23:29.611 --> 02:23:34.611
Guys Watch the same footage and diametrically disagree about whether or not they

2576
02:23:34.801 --> 02:23:37.560
witnessed a consensual or nonconsensual sex act.
And I'm like,

2577
02:23:37.561 --> 02:23:40.720
we got to see this footage.
So in a sense it's analogous,

2578
02:23:40.721 --> 02:23:43.210
this Trayvon Martin thing and the sort of way,
but you can,

2579
02:23:43.230 --> 02:23:44.370
you actually have a video,

2580
02:23:44.490 --> 02:23:47.640
but you have the video to predisposed to the Duke Lacrosse case,

2581
02:23:48.030 --> 02:23:50.880
the Duke Lacrosse case,
which they never turns out,
they never touched the girl.

2582
02:23:50.881 --> 02:23:53.850
A lot of the guys were alibied.
One guy was at an ATM machine,

2583
02:23:54.090 --> 02:23:57.860
make no withdrawal while the woman claims that he was raping her.
Um,

2584
02:23:57.960 --> 02:24:01.860
but here you had sexual intercourse.
Unquestionably.
Undeniably.

2585
02:24:01.861 --> 02:24:04.980
Here was video tape footage of the sexual intercourse.

2586
02:24:05.030 --> 02:24:09.220
Your take on what actually happened.
You got to see the movie.
He decided,
no,

2587
02:24:09.770 --> 02:24:10.610
I'm going to send it to you.

2588
02:24:10.980 --> 02:24:14.670
We don't have much time left to just tell me because you have to tell me like

2589
02:24:14.671 --> 02:24:15.504
what do you think?

2590
02:24:16.440 --> 02:24:19.530
What I think is is that you have one of the most oft committed,

2591
02:24:19.590 --> 02:24:24.360
least reported crimes in like the history of man and most of these crimes as

2592
02:24:24.361 --> 02:24:27.270
they say or not like the mass man in the bushes.

2593
02:24:27.300 --> 02:24:31.850
Stranger rape makes up the minority of rape.
It's mostly be assertive.

2594
02:24:32.430 --> 02:24:33.570
It's mostly acquaintance or date rape.

2595
02:24:33.571 --> 02:24:37.740
What I think though is that you have a world where we expect videotape footage

2596
02:24:37.741 --> 02:24:40.950
to tell an objective truth,
to say,
here's the surveillance video.

2597
02:24:40.990 --> 02:24:44.430
There is the guy robbing the store.
Let's go find him.
Case closed.

2598
02:24:44.640 --> 02:24:49.640
When you have a crime like this that exists predominantly in the minds of the

2599
02:24:50.611 --> 02:24:52.380
alleged victim and alleged perpetrator,

2600
02:24:52.500 --> 02:24:57.350
it's almost impossible to determine because not all,
you know what,
what,

2601
02:24:57.351 --> 02:25:00.810
what,
what.
What she claims is like,
this wasn't a a Hollywood rate.

2602
02:25:00.900 --> 02:25:04.470
This wasn't me kicking and screaming and crying going,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

2603
02:25:04.590 --> 02:25:07.350
She was a professional stripper.
She had been most of her life.

2604
02:25:07.710 --> 02:25:11.750
And she comes from a world where we spoke to a rape crisis counselor who,
who,

2605
02:25:11.760 --> 02:25:15.000
who,
whose office was near strip color,
close to a lot of strip clubs in Florida.

2606
02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:17.760
And he found a lot of professional girls,
so to speak,

2607
02:25:17.910 --> 02:25:22.070
who would come in and they're always trying to maintain a line,
you know,

2608
02:25:22.230 --> 02:25:25.510
this is what these are,
you don't ever got a lap dance.
Like here are the rules.

2609
02:25:25.511 --> 02:25:28.060
I can touch you.
You can it.
And then over the course of the thing,

2610
02:25:28.061 --> 02:25:31.240
depending on how much money is spent,
the law,
the lines get blurred.
You get,

2611
02:25:31.241 --> 02:25:34.180
you know,
there's certain things,
there's certain compromises that are made.

2612
02:25:34.330 --> 02:25:37.090
And so what happens here is that over the course of a long night,

2613
02:25:37.091 --> 02:25:38.590
she had danced at like three or four players.

2614
02:25:38.591 --> 02:25:42.400
There's like our third or fourth show last one of the night.
She,
um,

2615
02:25:43.060 --> 02:25:47.620
she partied with the guy she was drinking,
they were drinking.

2616
02:25:48.100 --> 02:25:49.840
They might've even been rolling on.

2617
02:25:49.900 --> 02:25:54.900
There's a lot of that line gets seriously blurred and what point can you,

2618
02:25:56.161 --> 02:25:59.440
you know at any point if a woman doesn't want,
if there was,
I,

2619
02:25:59.441 --> 02:26:00.910
I pull the audience,

2620
02:26:00.970 --> 02:26:02.920
and this is really interesting too because like I would call it the worst date

2621
02:26:02.921 --> 02:26:04.690
movie of all time.
I pull the audience,

2622
02:26:04.691 --> 02:26:07.870
we always assume that like the women would side with her and the men would side

2623
02:26:07.871 --> 02:26:12.730
with the men very often it's the exact opposite of that and the men are more

2624
02:26:12.731 --> 02:26:15.640
inclined to believe her and the women are more inclined to believe the men

2625
02:26:15.730 --> 02:26:17.110
because they don't want to,
they don't want to.

2626
02:26:17.470 --> 02:26:22.300
The behavior from both parties is pretty reprehensible depending on your morals

2627
02:26:22.301 --> 02:26:25.670
and values or some people,
it's a Tuesday night when brothers,

2628
02:26:25.720 --> 02:26:27.070
it's like this is appalling.

2629
02:26:27.220 --> 02:26:30.410
I don't want to associate my genders behavior with that behavior.

2630
02:26:30.850 --> 02:26:33.710
Not to say she deserves or anything,
but like people really want to dismiss.

2631
02:26:33.790 --> 02:26:34.261
It's interesting,

2632
02:26:34.261 --> 02:26:36.790
I talked to Roy Black and I know of the famous defense attorney.

2633
02:26:36.880 --> 02:26:39.250
One of his most famous clients was William Kennedy Smith,

2634
02:26:39.370 --> 02:26:43.600
the famous rape trial in Palm beach at the Kennedy compound.
And,
uh,

2635
02:26:43.750 --> 02:26:48.280
Roy Black going in.
Um,
the Kennedys were like,
well,

2636
02:26:48.281 --> 02:26:52.270
we need Kennedy Democrats on this jury obviously.

2637
02:26:52.630 --> 02:26:55.570
And the jury consultant came in and said,
no,

2638
02:26:55.571 --> 02:27:00.571
what you need is middle age or older white Republican women because their

2639
02:27:02.321 --> 02:27:03.730
values,
they're going to look at this,

2640
02:27:03.790 --> 02:27:07.150
this woman goes out with this man drinking and dining.
They go,

2641
02:27:07.270 --> 02:27:11.350
she goes back to his place at whatever ungodly hour of the night.

2642
02:27:11.500 --> 02:27:13.030
And what does she expect will happen.

2643
02:27:13.120 --> 02:27:16.690
That's much more the mentality of not Kennedy Democrats,

2644
02:27:16.691 --> 02:27:18.550
but they wound up going with that jury.

2645
02:27:18.551 --> 02:27:21.550
Not only did he get acquitted but Roy Black married the jury.

2646
02:27:21.760 --> 02:27:24.700
The jury for woman is lay a black,
if you're familiar with the,

2647
02:27:24.930 --> 02:27:28.380
the real housewives of my,
I'm sure you're an advocate for real.
Yeah,
I know.
Um,

2648
02:27:28.420 --> 02:27:32.170
the real housewives of Miami,
if you took nothing of that,
you took one guy.

2649
02:27:32.260 --> 02:27:34.540
If you took one part of each of the housewives,

2650
02:27:34.541 --> 02:27:38.230
you might be able to build one real one I think.
But like that's,
but that's,

2651
02:27:38.231 --> 02:27:43.060
anyway,
that's,
so we,
the men and women diametrically like our sort of opposed.

2652
02:27:43.240 --> 02:27:46.840
And then you have a situation where I pull the audience and I'll say,

2653
02:27:46.960 --> 02:27:51.040
how many of you believe she was raped?
How many of you believe she wasn't raped?

2654
02:27:51.880 --> 02:27:54.880
How many of you believe that some sexual activity occurred?

2655
02:27:54.970 --> 02:27:57.730
That she didn't consent to,
that she didn't want to happen?

2656
02:27:58.060 --> 02:28:01.510
Most people raise their hands.
I'm like,
well,
that under the law is right,

2657
02:28:01.600 --> 02:28:04.260
but how do you find a jury of 12 people that are,

2658
02:28:04.390 --> 02:28:07.540
that is going to convict based on Herbie.

2659
02:28:07.570 --> 02:28:10.900
This is what the social justice warrior websites,
they were just,

2660
02:28:10.901 --> 02:28:13.810
they were judging the pole.
They were judging her behavior.

2661
02:28:13.811 --> 02:28:16.480
And I'll tell you something I read in this case,
I'm with them.
Well,
I'm,

2662
02:28:16.481 --> 02:28:18.130
I'm reading the police report,

2663
02:28:18.131 --> 02:28:21.930
which was like a 70 page police report on a misdemeanor filing.
False police

2664
02:28:22.010 --> 02:28:25.040
<v 1>report against her,
the case against the woman for filing a false police report.</v>

2665
02:28:25.041 --> 02:28:27.110
And the woman who wrote it,
the detective,
um,

2666
02:28:27.140 --> 02:28:30.300
I ice thought it revealed more about her than,
than anybody else.
But she,
there's,

2667
02:28:30.440 --> 02:28:34.310
there's one phrase I'll never forget in all of these pages.
She writes,
um,

2668
02:28:35.240 --> 02:28:39.360
uh,
the woman went to Dan,
said all of these houses,
uh,
uh,

2669
02:28:39.470 --> 02:28:44.470
leaving her two children who are black at home with a babysitter or with their

2670
02:28:44.871 --> 02:28:49.370
mother or something like that.
And I was like,
who are just those three words?

2671
02:28:49.640 --> 02:28:53.090
And I was like,
who can,
she had been married to?
Her ex husband was a black man.

2672
02:28:53.091 --> 02:28:55.820
They had two children together.
And I was like,
what?

2673
02:28:55.910 --> 02:28:59.000
How in the world you live in Alachua County?

2674
02:28:59.001 --> 02:29:01.790
I don't know if that means something to people there,
but I was like,
how does,

2675
02:29:01.791 --> 02:29:05.870
how,
how is that have any,
who are,
is it her children who are black,

2676
02:29:05.871 --> 02:29:09.620
who are left to Polish at like her children who are Russian,

2677
02:29:09.680 --> 02:29:13.310
her children who are like,
I've never seen,
I'm like,
what are we trying,

2678
02:29:13.311 --> 02:29:16.280
what are we,
what's the implication or what's the relevance of this in a,

2679
02:29:16.281 --> 02:29:20.600
in a criminal proceeding.
But the,
I will put it you this way,
the people leave.

2680
02:29:20.800 --> 02:29:22.760
I over the course of working on the movie,

2681
02:29:22.761 --> 02:29:26.150
I changed my mind several times over the course of watching the movie and as you

2682
02:29:26.151 --> 02:29:28.910
live life and get more life experience it cause people come to this movie with

2683
02:29:28.911 --> 02:29:30.710
their own baggage.
I've seen,

2684
02:29:30.980 --> 02:29:33.450
I've had Q and A's where women get up to the microphone and say,

2685
02:29:33.451 --> 02:29:34.640
I've never said this before.

2686
02:29:34.700 --> 02:29:38.210
I was the victim of a rape on campus and start talking.
It's a very,

2687
02:29:38.220 --> 02:29:39.560
can be a very cathartic experience.

2688
02:29:39.580 --> 02:29:43.090
Can Be very disturbing either people can't even watch it.
Common.
I mean,

2689
02:29:43.150 --> 02:29:46.250
but it's also come false rape claims are also very calm.
They're not,

2690
02:29:46.670 --> 02:29:50.120
they're not common.
Not Common.
Rape claims happen all the time.

2691
02:29:50.150 --> 02:29:53.300
They're not common.
What do you mean by not common there?
There,
there,

2692
02:29:53.301 --> 02:29:57.440
there are my,
they're a minority of of rape claims.
I agree with that.

2693
02:29:57.680 --> 02:29:59.180
However they still common.
Yes,

2694
02:29:59.270 --> 02:30:03.560
and extraordinarily damaging to everybody involved but common.
No,
I don't.

2695
02:30:03.740 --> 02:30:07.190
What do you mean by not coming well?
I think rape.

2696
02:30:07.520 --> 02:30:11.900
What percentage is not common?
I think did if they happen every day and they do,

2697
02:30:11.930 --> 02:30:15.950
is that not common?
I think,
I think you're talking,
yes,
it's common,

2698
02:30:15.951 --> 02:30:18.210
but you're talking about single digits I think.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.

2699
02:30:18.211 --> 02:30:20.960
I'm not talking about majority.
Okay.
Now talking about that.

2700
02:30:20.961 --> 02:30:24.920
I'm talking about they occur regularly then they're just common,
right?
Yes.

2701
02:30:24.940 --> 02:30:27.620
That they occur regularly and that must be taken if you're going to look into

2702
02:30:27.621 --> 02:30:30.440
some completely objectively.
Yes,
you are.
Well you're,
you know,

2703
02:30:30.470 --> 02:30:32.840
you're being sensitive to the victims,
which is very important.

2704
02:30:33.080 --> 02:30:37.640
But if you look at it objectively and it just as strictly as an a numerical

2705
02:30:37.641 --> 02:30:38.970
issue,
I mean I,

2706
02:30:38.980 --> 02:30:43.730
I believe the numbers like 8% I think that's the statistically proven number as

2707
02:30:43.731 --> 02:30:47.390
far as like investigated claims of,
right.
I think it's lower,

2708
02:30:47.391 --> 02:30:51.550
but it is single digits.
Yes.
I think it's the same.

2709
02:30:51.880 --> 02:30:53.410
It probably varies.
And then there's also the,
the,

2710
02:30:53.411 --> 02:30:58.100
the reality that a lot of rapes go unreported because women are ashamed of what

2711
02:30:58.101 --> 02:30:59.930
happened and they would rather just ignore it because they're going to be

2712
02:30:59.931 --> 02:31:03.580
accused of false reporting and their entire past and sexual experience is going

2713
02:31:03.581 --> 02:31:06.440
to be brought to bear.
And Yeah,
there's a lot.
And there's also,

2714
02:31:06.441 --> 02:31:09.410
you also have to take any consideration.
A lot of false rape claims.

2715
02:31:09.411 --> 02:31:12.530
The guys get convicted and it's never proven.
That's a false rape claim.

2716
02:31:12.560 --> 02:31:17.000
That's a fact.
I've had that happen to a friend.
I know that it works both ways.

2717
02:31:17.001 --> 02:31:19.890
Human beings are we,
you know,

2718
02:31:19.891 --> 02:31:22.620
there's people that are full of shit and they're men and there's people that are

2719
02:31:22.621 --> 02:31:25.110
full of shit that are women,
so there's,

2720
02:31:25.111 --> 02:31:29.050
there's always going to be that possibility that it's a false racial.

2721
02:31:29.050 --> 02:31:31.960
Gender has the greatest percentage of people full of Shit.
No,
I'm just fine.

2722
02:31:33.120 --> 02:31:35.880
It's across the board.
Probably.
Probably 50% across the board.

2723
02:31:36.300 --> 02:31:39.750
You don't even think I was just fucking with you,
Matt.

2724
02:31:39.751 --> 02:31:44.040
Maybe men because men,
well,
no,
because men try harder to fuck women,

2725
02:31:44.160 --> 02:31:46.710
so maybe we have to be because women were pursued.

2726
02:31:46.740 --> 02:31:50.370
We have to be more full of shit.
I think that's more possible.
I don't know.

2727
02:31:50.371 --> 02:31:53.640
That's a good question.
That's a good documentary subject.
What?
What?

2728
02:31:53.641 --> 02:31:57.360
Gender is more full of Shit.
It's a great title.
Yeah,
it's a great title.

2729
02:31:57.480 --> 02:32:00.270
What gender is more full of Shit.
That's,
that's not a bad idea.

2730
02:32:00.450 --> 02:32:02.490
I think you're right.
I think that we're going to find it's pretty,

2731
02:32:02.790 --> 02:32:05.560
it's pretty close.
It's pretty close.
But you know,
the,

2732
02:32:05.561 --> 02:32:08.610
the rape thing as far as like,
you know what,

2733
02:32:08.670 --> 02:32:13.140
I think there's way more raped and there is falsely accused Vic,
you know,

2734
02:32:13.141 --> 02:32:17.140
false false rape claims.
Well I,
and,
and,
and,
and in this spirit of,

2735
02:32:17.141 --> 02:32:19.320
of justice and the spirit of,
you know,
let,

2736
02:32:19.920 --> 02:32:24.810
let 10 mil e t let 10 guilty men go free than one innocent man spend,

2737
02:32:24.830 --> 02:32:28.320
you know,
a moment being deprived of his liberty.
I mean,
I,
I under,

2738
02:32:28.321 --> 02:32:32.610
I understand that and I gotta say no matter how low the rate is,

2739
02:32:32.640 --> 02:32:35.730
2% according to Wikipedia,
that no matter how low that is,

2740
02:32:35.880 --> 02:32:40.680
the 2% of men that,
that the false claims occurred to,

2741
02:32:40.740 --> 02:32:44.880
it's pretty fucking important to them.
I can imagine.
Oh yeah.
But in those cases,

2742
02:32:45.020 --> 02:32:49.320
it's one 10th of 1% of its you.
And in those,
in the vast majority of those cases,

2743
02:32:49.321 --> 02:32:51.690
I believe it has to do with some sort of like,
you know,

2744
02:32:51.780 --> 02:32:53.850
mental deficiency on the part of the woman.

2745
02:32:53.851 --> 02:32:57.780
It has to do with some sort of revenge kind of scenario.
You know,

2746
02:32:57.781 --> 02:33:01.580
like the motive is like really personal and really obvious.
Um,

2747
02:33:01.860 --> 02:33:04.670
and can usually be quickly proven,
but as soon as you are accused something,

2748
02:33:04.700 --> 02:33:07.680
there's some cases where you're right,
it can't,
it's strictly a he said,
she said,

2749
02:33:07.950 --> 02:33:11.190
and you could find yourself,
uh,
in,
in a lot of trouble.

2750
02:33:11.220 --> 02:33:15.950
And that's obviously not okay.
I think the problem is you cannot be w w we,

2751
02:33:15.951 --> 02:33:20.280
we have a society that I think unfortunately discourages women from reporting,

2752
02:33:20.370 --> 02:33:24.870
from coming forward.
And I think that that's a serious problem because in,

2753
02:33:24.871 --> 02:33:25.920
in crimes like this,

2754
02:33:26.100 --> 02:33:31.020
a lot of the people who commit them can continue to commit them.

2755
02:33:31.380 --> 02:33:35.820
The rate of recidivism I think is,
is such that if they're not being reported,

2756
02:33:35.821 --> 02:33:40.380
you're going to see more victims,
unfortunately.
Well,
there's,
there's also,

2757
02:33:40.650 --> 02:33:41.700
without a doubt,

2758
02:33:41.790 --> 02:33:45.780
there's people that for whatever reason,

2759
02:33:46.230 --> 02:33:50.790
they don't look at other people as being equal to them,
you know,

2760
02:33:50.850 --> 02:33:54.420
and that,
that is what allows someone to rape someone.

2761
02:33:54.570 --> 02:33:56.910
That's what happens in this video.
She is a local girl.

2762
02:33:57.150 --> 02:34:00.690
She goes to Santa Fe community college as opposed to like,
you know,

2763
02:34:00.720 --> 02:34:05.280
the flagship state school that like the,
the quote rich had a town kids,
you know,

2764
02:34:05.460 --> 02:34:10.080
I'll go to,
and they treat her like,
you know,
the way they speak to her,

2765
02:34:10.470 --> 02:34:14.490
the way they speak to her.
And,
and it's a similar phenomenon in,
in,

2766
02:34:14.491 --> 02:34:18.130
in the Duke Lacrosse case is that that woman was black.
But here,
this

2767
02:34:18.130 --> 02:34:22.480
<v 2>woman who was white and in this,
in this raw deal case,
uh,
but had black children,</v>

2768
02:34:22.930 --> 02:34:27.610
the,
it's I think,
well,
what's,
what's the famous line from,
from Bulworth?
Um,
uh,

2769
02:34:27.820 --> 02:34:31.060
white people have more in common with black people than they do with rich
people.

2770
02:34:31.540 --> 02:34:35.920
Meaning the division is not so much black and white.
That's kind of a,

2771
02:34:36.130 --> 02:34:39.580
that's a flashy object to divide us and Torah and affluent.
Absolutely.

2772
02:34:39.581 --> 02:34:43.030
It's the haves and the have nots and the poor people get treated like shit no

2773
02:34:43.031 --> 02:34:47.170
matter what color.
But also people in that position,
people that are strippers,

2774
02:34:47.171 --> 02:34:47.421
you know,

2775
02:34:47.421 --> 02:34:52.421
because it's looked down upon as like a CD career choice of losers,

2776
02:34:52.960 --> 02:34:54.970
you know,
so you're allowed to treat her like shit.

2777
02:34:54.971 --> 02:34:58.420
And then she's in a fraternity,
which is not even a protected environment,

2778
02:34:58.421 --> 02:35:02.710
like an actual strip club and you're dealing with people that are drunk and

2779
02:35:02.711 --> 02:35:06.730
their judgments all fucked up because of that.
And then you know,
who knows?

2780
02:35:06.970 --> 02:35:11.950
Plus you're dealing with developing minds,
an 18 year old kids that are drunk,

2781
02:35:11.951 --> 02:35:15.040
they really shouldn't be drunk.
They don't know what the fuck they're doing.

2782
02:35:15.220 --> 02:35:18.880
And on top of that,
they'd probably been raised by assholes,
you know,

2783
02:35:18.881 --> 02:35:23.500
I mean there's a good percentage of people are assholes and these kids drunk in

2784
02:35:23.501 --> 02:35:26.950
some fucking thing,
feeding off of each other,
getting mentality,

2785
02:35:26.951 --> 02:35:31.951
which is peer pressure of that situation as is dead fucking terrible deadly gang

2786
02:35:32.261 --> 02:35:34.180
mentality that you see in riots,

2787
02:35:34.630 --> 02:35:39.060
gang mentality that you see in behavior that you would never see gangs or

2788
02:35:39.100 --> 02:35:44.100
behavior to the point of criminality because of the outside influence of what

2789
02:35:44.530 --> 02:35:48.660
everybody else doing it.
That's like a psychosis.
That's a crazy,

2790
02:35:48.680 --> 02:35:53.340
like what's going on in the brain?
Well,
it says,
it speaks to our weird,
uh,

2791
02:35:53.590 --> 02:35:56.080
the,
the way that human beings imitate our atmospheres,

2792
02:35:56.230 --> 02:35:59.500
which is like a big part of what we were talking about earlier about culture.

2793
02:35:59.740 --> 02:36:04.740
You get stuck in certain cultures and cultures where violence is accepted and

2794
02:36:05.261 --> 02:36:07.750
violence.
Like if you live in the Congo,
you know,
and you're,

2795
02:36:07.751 --> 02:36:11.740
you're in a tribe and you're,
you're,
there's a warlord,
you know,

2796
02:36:11.741 --> 02:36:14.320
and you're seeing people shot and killed all the time.

2797
02:36:14.321 --> 02:36:18.110
The [inaudible] 47 when you're five.
Yeah.
I mean it's just,
that's,

2798
02:36:18.140 --> 02:36:21.070
that's their environment.
I have to ask you this then,
because I mean,

2799
02:36:21.071 --> 02:36:23.560
you've talked about it a zillion times,
but like America's gun culture,

2800
02:36:23.561 --> 02:36:24.610
that's what everybody says.

2801
02:36:24.611 --> 02:36:28.150
America's propensity towards violence and proliferation of violence.

2802
02:36:28.151 --> 02:36:32.530
And you don't see this in other country because you don't see the quantity of

2803
02:36:32.790 --> 02:36:37.150
guns.
Yeah,
well,
it's an issue.
And the celebration of violence,
of course,

2804
02:36:37.151 --> 02:36:39.760
in our media and our,
our entertainment,
et Cetera,

2805
02:36:39.790 --> 02:36:44.230
that's an issue to the celebration and video games celebration and all those

2806
02:36:44.231 --> 02:36:47.800
things are unquestionably influences.
However,

2807
02:36:47.920 --> 02:36:51.700
if you look at the actual numbers of people that have guns,

2808
02:36:51.701 --> 02:36:55.750
which is fucking staggering,
and the actual crimes committed by those guns,

2809
02:36:56.080 --> 02:36:59.500
it's very small.
Yeah,
absolutely.
Which is undeniable.

2810
02:36:59.501 --> 02:37:02.710
And that's something that people don't like to bring up when they bring up a

2811
02:37:02.711 --> 02:37:06.250
Newtown massacre or something where you have massacres.

2812
02:37:06.340 --> 02:37:10.180
I believe those are issues of mental health without a doubt.

2813
02:37:10.210 --> 02:37:11.680
And I think absolutely,
you know,

2814
02:37:11.681 --> 02:37:16.340
I wrote that this country has a mental health problem disguised a gun problem

2815
02:37:16.520 --> 02:37:19.430
and a tyranny problem disguised as a security problem.

2816
02:37:19.970 --> 02:37:24.970
And I think that that is a real reality when it comes to guns and shooters and

2817
02:37:26.421 --> 02:37:27.290
mental issues.

2818
02:37:27.500 --> 02:37:30.620
And also the number of people that are involved in mass shootings that are on

2819
02:37:30.621 --> 02:37:34.960
psychoactive drugs,
anti psychotics,
auntie's impressions,

2820
02:37:35.140 --> 02:37:39.680
poison is what,
who knows?
But correlation does not equal causation.
Right.

2821
02:37:39.800 --> 02:37:43.040
So you don't know if those people were crazy already and they're giving them

2822
02:37:43.041 --> 02:37:45.560
drugs to try to treat them and maybe there would be better off.

2823
02:37:45.620 --> 02:37:50.320
Maybe it's getting off those drugs,
which is often the case.
The,
the,
the um,

2824
02:37:50.360 --> 02:37:54.320
um,
coming down off those drugs for all affects the withdraw.
The causes,

2825
02:37:54.321 --> 02:37:56.870
these people to go crazy.
There's a lot of issues,

2826
02:37:56.871 --> 02:38:00.080
but you can't deny that it's too fucking easy to get a gun.
You know,

2827
02:38:00.081 --> 02:38:02.750
you need a driver's license to get a fucking car.

2828
02:38:02.900 --> 02:38:05.590
All you need to do is not be a criminal to get a gun.
I mean,
I,

2829
02:38:05.591 --> 02:38:07.640
I bought a gun before I knew anything about guns.

2830
02:38:07.641 --> 02:38:10.940
I didn't know how to use them at all.
They just let me have a fucking pistol.

2831
02:38:11.150 --> 02:38:14.660
And I remember thinking it must have a hot dog stand for crying you to have a

2832
02:38:14.661 --> 02:38:16.930
permit to shovel snow.
Think Jersey.
I'm an,

2833
02:38:17.060 --> 02:38:19.370
I'm a nice person so I'm not going to go out and shoot people.

2834
02:38:19.371 --> 02:38:21.950
But I found it incredibly disturbing that it,
they didn't all,

2835
02:38:21.951 --> 02:38:24.290
they immediately know that I didn't,
wasn't a criminal.

2836
02:38:24.410 --> 02:38:27.830
I didn't commit any violent crimes.
And that's it.
That's all he needed to know.

2837
02:38:27.860 --> 02:38:29.960
And truth be told,
if you were a criminal when on the street to get it,

2838
02:38:29.961 --> 02:38:32.120
it would be even easier than he walked into because they don't want your

2839
02:38:32.121 --> 02:38:36.440
driver's license if you're buying them,
especially in this country at this point.

2840
02:38:36.441 --> 02:38:39.650
The numbers,
there's the sheer numbers.
Like I've heard it described,

2841
02:38:39.651 --> 02:38:42.890
like trying to get guns out of America was like trying to take salt out of the

2842
02:38:42.891 --> 02:38:44.660
ocean.
It's like Jesus Christ.

2843
02:38:44.661 --> 02:38:46.250
Like you're going to get all the salts out of the ocean.

2844
02:38:46.460 --> 02:38:49.280
There's more Americans with,

2845
02:38:49.310 --> 02:38:52.410
or there's more guns rather than there are Americans.
And in,

2846
02:38:52.420 --> 02:38:56.720
in America there's more guns.
Then there are people that's fucking crazy.

2847
02:38:56.960 --> 02:39:00.200
There's more than 350 million guns in this country.

2848
02:39:00.380 --> 02:39:04.310
That is hard to wrap your head around.
You know,
I,

2849
02:39:04.590 --> 02:39:07.580
I got two hands,
but the mail,
most of us have time.

2850
02:39:07.590 --> 02:39:10.520
I have more guns than I am people.
So I'm part of the problem.

2851
02:39:10.550 --> 02:39:13.610
But I'm not shooting anybody.
You're above average,
you know,
I only have,

2852
02:39:13.670 --> 02:39:17.420
I only have a couple.
So I just don't think that,
um,
that,

2853
02:39:17.450 --> 02:39:22.450
that I don't think that the issue is necessarily that there's a lot of guns.

2854
02:39:25.760 --> 02:39:30.760
The issue to me is we most certainly need a better education program when it

2855
02:39:31.851 --> 02:39:34.230
comes to the ability to acquire a gun.
They've,
they've,

2856
02:39:34.320 --> 02:39:36.500
the fact that you have to go through this,
you know,

2857
02:39:36.560 --> 02:39:39.770
difficult taxing process to get a car.

2858
02:39:39.890 --> 02:39:43.130
But I think people were afraid that like,
you know,

2859
02:39:43.131 --> 02:39:46.430
like they say that owning a car is a privilege on a gun as a right.

2860
02:39:46.490 --> 02:39:48.400
It's a right that's in the bill.
You know what I mean?
That's a,

2861
02:39:48.530 --> 02:39:50.990
it's in the bill of rights.
It's a second amendment in the constitution.

2862
02:39:50.991 --> 02:39:53.540
It says right to bear arms and there's,

2863
02:39:53.541 --> 02:39:57.260
there's people that are legitimately worried for good reason that a lot of

2864
02:39:57.261 --> 02:40:00.790
people have this knee jerk reaction when any sort of violent crime goes down to

2865
02:40:00.791 --> 02:40:03.380
take all the guns away from the p.
But I don't think that,
I don't know,

2866
02:40:03.381 --> 02:40:07.460
maybe having to take a shooting course is an impediment to your exercising of

2867
02:40:07.630 --> 02:40:09.500
that safety.
I'm a I,
my family,

2868
02:40:09.501 --> 02:40:14.300
I got family in Delaware and they grew up in gun culture,
a hunting culture

2869
02:40:14.310 --> 02:40:18.390
<v 1>and about,
and there's some of the most responsible,
coolest,
best p,
you know,
they,</v>

2870
02:40:18.540 --> 02:40:22.860
because it guns had been completely demystified for them.

2871
02:40:22.950 --> 02:40:23.783
They're not afraid.

2872
02:40:23.790 --> 02:40:27.720
They know how to properly use them and they're the least threatening,

2873
02:40:27.930 --> 02:40:30.570
most coolest,
most unassuming people that you could possibly.

2874
02:40:30.690 --> 02:40:33.690
But they're cool with any type of weapon that you,
that you know,

2875
02:40:33.691 --> 02:40:36.210
basically that you put in front,
not just guns,

2876
02:40:36.211 --> 02:40:39.360
but knives that they use for hunting.
And Evan and I were just like,

2877
02:40:39.361 --> 02:40:41.130
what if we all grew up like,
wouldn't it just be,

2878
02:40:41.190 --> 02:40:43.230
I think we'd all be nicer to each other to like,

2879
02:40:43.231 --> 02:40:46.290
we'd all be aware of sort of the power that we possess from the,
you know,

2880
02:40:46.380 --> 02:40:49.860
we're not just these sort of like TV gangsters or whatever.
We don't,
you know,
we,

2881
02:40:49.950 --> 02:40:50.530
we'd all just,

2882
02:40:50.530 --> 02:40:54.270
we'd almost be a little bit more cognizant of the fact that we have this w if we

2883
02:40:54.271 --> 02:40:56.520
choose to have the power of life and death over somebody,

2884
02:40:56.580 --> 02:40:59.570
but they also have it over us.
Well,
that's what's live and let live,
right?

2885
02:40:59.571 --> 02:41:03.090
And expression that a well armed society is a polite society.

2886
02:41:03.630 --> 02:41:06.810
And oftentimes that is true.
But the aberration,

2887
02:41:06.811 --> 02:41:11.200
the person who is not polite and decides to take out the fact that they have do,

2888
02:41:11.250 --> 02:41:15.390
do you remember that instance in north Hollywood years back when those guys got

2889
02:41:15.710 --> 02:41:19.950
the put on bulletproof vests and had all these crazy guns and they robbed a bank

2890
02:41:19.960 --> 02:41:23.820
record?
Yeah,
the heat was inspired by in crazy,

2891
02:41:23.850 --> 02:41:25.110
crazy scene.

2892
02:41:25.111 --> 02:41:28.860
I was doing news radio at the time and we all went into the break room and we're

2893
02:41:28.861 --> 02:41:31.350
all watching it on his television and we were all just like,

2894
02:41:31.351 --> 02:41:35.280
freaking the fuck out.
Like this is real.
This isn't a movie.

2895
02:41:35.400 --> 02:41:40.400
We're watching a shootout between the cops and these insane people with massive

2896
02:41:40.420 --> 02:41:43.860
firepower.
And those types of scenarios,

2897
02:41:43.890 --> 02:41:45.450
although incredibly rare,

2898
02:41:45.570 --> 02:41:48.660
are really legitimately frightening to people for a good reason.

2899
02:41:48.690 --> 02:41:50.010
That's what happened in,
in,
in Miami.

2900
02:41:50.040 --> 02:41:53.700
You remember the war wagon at the Dadeland mall shooting in July of 79 that we

2901
02:41:53.701 --> 02:41:58.260
opened cocaine cowboys.
When cops show up at this scene,

2902
02:41:59.040 --> 02:42:03.210
they have guns on the ground.
Uh,
and to be Canon,
the,
uh,
the reporter said,

2903
02:42:03.300 --> 02:42:05.160
they called them the dis,
the Dixie Cup generation.

2904
02:42:05.161 --> 02:42:08.490
They would shoot a gun until it was empty and then just drop it on the floor and

2905
02:42:08.491 --> 02:42:09.720
pull out another gun and shoot that.

2906
02:42:09.900 --> 02:42:14.090
And there were Mac eleven's and there were a hand guns and pistols and automatic

2907
02:42:14.110 --> 02:42:15.930
a pistols.
And they were just,
and they,

2908
02:42:16.140 --> 02:42:19.260
and there was a shell casings for every single gun on the ground.

2909
02:42:19.261 --> 02:42:22.170
They left the guns in the ground and then they took off on foot and they

2910
02:42:22.171 --> 02:42:23.850
abandoned this war wagon,

2911
02:42:23.851 --> 02:42:28.851
which was this converted 40 Econoline van that had stenciled on the side,

2912
02:42:29.520 --> 02:42:32.970
happy time,
party supply and a phone number.
And then the other side it said,

2913
02:42:33.210 --> 02:42:36.480
happy supply time in a different phone number on the other side,

2914
02:42:36.540 --> 02:42:38.910
not really good with the,
you know,
the,
the incognito thing here.

2915
02:42:39.090 --> 02:42:43.800
And in the back they had flak jackets that they had put that they had kind of

2916
02:42:43.801 --> 02:42:46.520
like wallpaper that width so that it would be like,

2917
02:42:46.530 --> 02:42:51.530
have reinforced bulletproof armor and more guns of every shotguns and machine

2918
02:42:51.571 --> 02:42:53.520
got.
So it was like the punishers war wagon.

2919
02:42:53.530 --> 02:42:57.240
Cops show up with their six shooters by the way,

2920
02:42:57.270 --> 02:42:59.910
cause that's what they were carrying in Miami in 1979.

2921
02:43:00.180 --> 02:43:03.420
And they flipped the fuck out.
And there was a,

2922
02:43:03.450 --> 02:43:07.830
every time someone saw 40 Connor line van,
like on the streets,

2923
02:43:07.950 --> 02:43:09.660
people were calling nine one one.

2924
02:43:09.810 --> 02:43:11.980
The cops wouldn't show like they didn't know what the hell to

2925
02:43:11.980 --> 02:43:15.010
<v 3>do because they knew that the fear was you're gonna pull one of these over.</v>

2926
02:43:15.250 --> 02:43:17.800
The back's going to open up and they're just going to empty,

2927
02:43:17.860 --> 02:43:21.820
empty on and before you can even grab your pop,
pop,
pop gun,
you know,

2928
02:43:21.880 --> 02:43:25.720
and that was when they started to put together the syntech 26,
the four.

2929
02:43:25.721 --> 02:43:27.970
There you go.
There's the back of it right there.
And,
and um,

2930
02:43:28.330 --> 02:43:29.340
they put together this,
uh,

2931
02:43:29.560 --> 02:43:34.560
sentec was a central central tactical unit that was made up of multiple local

2932
02:43:34.841 --> 02:43:37.310
and federal agencies that would work together.
The,

2933
02:43:37.510 --> 02:43:39.790
the history of which traces back to the untouchables.

2934
02:43:39.870 --> 02:43:42.970
Cause that was like we're going to come back to take the best of the local guys

2935
02:43:42.971 --> 02:43:46.420
and the best of the federal guys and put them together towards a kind of common,

2936
02:43:46.570 --> 02:43:49.270
very specific goal oriented mission and end.

2937
02:43:49.480 --> 02:43:52.360
And so you had these guys who got together because originally they were called

2938
02:43:52.361 --> 02:43:55.230
the,
uh,
it's in reloaded,
um,
uh,

2939
02:43:55.300 --> 02:44:00.100
the special homicide investigative team or as they call themselves the Shit

2940
02:44:00.100 --> 02:44:01.960
Squad special homicide investigative team.

2941
02:44:02.140 --> 02:44:05.010
And they had to deal with all the one dose that we're turning up because they'd

2942
02:44:05.011 --> 02:44:07.100
get,
they'd get an Oh God,
uh,

2943
02:44:07.720 --> 02:44:11.530
unidentified Hispanic male automatic bullet fire.

2944
02:44:11.531 --> 02:44:16.531
Is it 25% of the bodies in the Morgan that time in Miami had automatic wounds

2945
02:44:17.111 --> 02:44:20.950
from automatic weapons friend who was doing his residency,

2946
02:44:20.951 --> 02:44:23.470
he's a doctor or anything.
It was residency in Miami.

2947
02:44:23.471 --> 02:44:25.540
That was the best place to do it.
Oh my God.

2948
02:44:25.541 --> 02:44:29.560
He told me some shit and showed me some shit when we were growing up.
You know,

2949
02:44:29.561 --> 02:44:31.990
I was,
he's older than me.
And,
uh,

2950
02:44:32.400 --> 02:44:37.400
when he was showing us these images that he had saved from guys with light bulbs

2951
02:44:38.051 --> 02:44:42.280
up their asses and bullet hole in the trauma industry,
in the medical business,

2952
02:44:42.281 --> 02:44:43.390
the law enforcement business,

2953
02:44:43.391 --> 02:44:46.660
the homicide business journalism business like Miami was the place to be.

2954
02:44:46.720 --> 02:44:49.450
It was crazy.
The one I know a guy who was a,

2955
02:44:49.460 --> 02:44:53.380
who was a trauma doctor at Jackson Memorial Hospital in the,
in the,
that's our,

2956
02:44:53.410 --> 02:44:57.040
that's our one major trauma center where you know all the bullet,
you,

2957
02:44:57.041 --> 02:44:59.530
you get airlifted to Jackson,
that's where you go.

2958
02:44:59.680 --> 02:45:03.370
So he was working one night and this was after the Mariel boatlift.

2959
02:45:03.430 --> 02:45:07.110
It thinks Scarface,
like you had all of these hardened criminals.
The,
the,

2960
02:45:07.111 --> 02:45:12.010
the rejected from Cuba rate of rape on Miami beach quadrupled in months.

2961
02:45:12.040 --> 02:45:14.230
I mean,
they were raping little old Jewish ladies,

2962
02:45:14.231 --> 02:45:17.830
Holocaust survivors who made it out of Germany but could not survive the Mariel

2963
02:45:17.831 --> 02:45:21.280
boatlift in Miami.
And they all went to Miami beach because it was a slum.

2964
02:45:21.430 --> 02:45:23.950
And because you had the,
it reminded them of Havana,
it looked like Cuba,

2965
02:45:23.951 --> 02:45:26.590
Miami beach,
like,
Oh shit.
Like that sea wall.
And every,
it looks like Cuba,

2966
02:45:26.740 --> 02:45:30.640
so on and,
and they would just kill you for nothing.
They'd be like,

2967
02:45:30.670 --> 02:45:32.950
I like your bicycle.
Gimme your bicycle.
No,
boom,

2968
02:45:33.130 --> 02:45:35.160
and just end and then leave the bike until like,

2969
02:45:35.210 --> 02:45:39.670
like just crazy homicidal lunatics.
Um,
and uh,
they,

2970
02:45:40.060 --> 02:45:42.140
uh,
one guy,
one day,
Mariel,

2971
02:45:42.250 --> 02:45:45.700
Mariel Lito comes in with a gunshot wound and the doctor says to him,

2972
02:45:46.270 --> 02:45:48.850
he knew Spanish.
She said,
he said,
you're very lucky,
man.

2973
02:45:48.940 --> 02:45:53.530
Had the bullet struck you a centimeter or so over here,

2974
02:45:53.770 --> 02:45:58.660
you would have bled out and died on the scene.
And in minutes if not seconds,
um,

2975
02:45:58.750 --> 02:46:00.880
the guy gets discharged,
leaves the hospital,
uh,

2976
02:46:00.881 --> 02:46:05.881
within days he gets another Mariel gunshot victim with a wound in exactly the

2977
02:46:06.041 --> 02:46:09.980
same spot he told the other guy about and that guy died.

2978
02:46:10.310 --> 02:46:13.370
<v 1>And his belief always was,
he never could prove it,
but that the guy,</v>

2979
02:46:13.371 --> 02:46:17.450
he had told basically where to shoot the other guy that this was a retribution

2980
02:46:17.451 --> 02:46:20.360
shooting for the other guy who had been shot.
But like,

2981
02:46:20.361 --> 02:46:23.180
that was just par for the course.
And in Miami,
the girl who cuts my hair,

2982
02:46:23.420 --> 02:46:27.100
a lady who cuts my hair,
she,
you know how you get your hair cut,
you,
you,
you,

2983
02:46:27.101 --> 02:46:29.090
you say goodbye.
You put the tip in the,
in the pocket.

2984
02:46:29.091 --> 02:46:32.360
So she'd go would go home at night in the 80s and she'd turn her pockets inside

2985
02:46:32.361 --> 02:46:35.270
out to get all of the folded bills in this net.
One day she found,

2986
02:46:35.300 --> 02:46:39.380
finds a little Baggie with white powder in it that one of the ladies just
saying,

2987
02:46:39.590 --> 02:46:44.360
kissed her goodbye and slipped it in their pocket as a tip.
And,
and she,
she said,

2988
02:46:44.361 --> 02:46:47.150
I was so naive.
I said to my friend,
what the hell is this?
And she said,

2989
02:46:47.330 --> 02:46:51.040
what it is is worth more than the tip that you would have that you would have

2990
02:46:51.050 --> 02:46:55.190
gotten from the same ladies.
Wow.
That's what that was.
That's a,

2991
02:46:55.191 --> 02:46:59.810
that's our enemy.
That's our Emmy.
Keep it in.
Keep that place.

2992
02:46:59.960 --> 02:47:02.840
I visit your loss and your,
your Los Angeles.
You can have it.

2993
02:47:02.870 --> 02:47:06.890
I visit and I get the fuck out again.
Billy.
Thank you very much man.

2994

I really enjoyed it.

Don't apologize.

2997
02:47:21.910 --> 02:47:26.890
It's one,
one of the best documentaries ever that captures the madness of,

2998
02:47:26.920 --> 02:47:29.330
of,
