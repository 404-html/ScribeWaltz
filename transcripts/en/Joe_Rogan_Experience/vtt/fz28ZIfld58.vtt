<v Speaker 1>this guy has got maybe was too much.</v>

219
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.270
<v Speaker 1>Maybe like rebellion,</v>

220
00:07:05.271 --> 00:07:05.451
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

221
00:07:05.451 --> 00:07:05.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

223
00:07:06.921 --> 00:07:08.330
<v Speaker 1>His mom finds out about this.</v>

224
00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:14.020
<v Speaker 1>I think he lives at homestyle because we've studied the videos and it seems as</v>

225
00:07:14.031 --> 00:07:18.350
<v Speaker 1>though these are like prior to that location there was one that was up just a</v>

226
00:07:18.351 --> 00:07:22.790
<v Speaker 1>bedroom in a basement and I think he actually did live with his folks and we've</v>

227
00:07:22.791 --> 00:07:27.791
<v Speaker 1>deduced that this might be like a fetish thing because it's gluttony and then</v>

228
00:07:27.951 --> 00:07:32.951
<v Speaker 1>farts and he won't answer any of my neighbors tweets or that people just bombard</v>

229
00:07:33.771 --> 00:07:36.890
<v Speaker 1>him with him cause he put an email in one and we will on our show.</v>

230
00:07:36.891 --> 00:07:39.950
<v Speaker 1>We're like everybody even unlike and no response know if you could get to the</v>

231
00:07:39.951 --> 00:07:41.540
<v Speaker 1>bottom of this we'd really appreciate you.</v>

232
00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:45.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to cause I'm terrified one day he'll be in here and the party in my</v>

233
00:07:45.561 --> 00:07:47.270
<v Speaker 1>fucking Ergonomic chairs,</v>

234
00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.291
<v Speaker 1>the family,</v>

235
00:07:48.291 --> 00:07:52.400
<v Speaker 1>the family thing also is because on the Christmas one you can tell it's a family</v>

236
00:07:52.401 --> 00:07:56.240
<v Speaker 1>home and then there's stockings up and he farts and every stocking</v>

237
00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:58.713
<v Speaker 1>and then he goes,</v>

238
00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:01.820
<v Speaker 1>that's what you get from King ass report for Merry Christmas.</v>

239
00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:06.030
<v Speaker 1>Taking ass represents coast is probably going to die.</v>

240
00:08:06.031 --> 00:08:07.640
<v Speaker 1>You probably have something wrong with his colon.</v>

241
00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:09.110
<v Speaker 1>That's an interesting theory too.</v>

242
00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.430
<v Speaker 1>And people have also</v>

243
00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:14.470
<v Speaker 1>brought about the theory that he is uh,</v>

244
00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:16.430
<v Speaker 1>doing that pushing air in there.</v>

245
00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:17.160
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

246
00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:17.993
<v Speaker 1>you think it's cheating,</v>

247
00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:18.671
<v Speaker 1>he's cheating.</v>

248
00:08:18.671 --> 00:08:21.830
<v Speaker 1>I believe that Tom like filling himself with air and then fighting it cause</v>

249
00:08:21.831 --> 00:08:24.170
<v Speaker 1>there's know edits between each fart.</v>

250
00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:24.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

251
00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:28.250
<v Speaker 1>I would assume that he can't fart rapid fire that loud.</v>

252
00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:29.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean you'd,</v>

253
00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.580
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to be some sort of bag of wind,</v>

254
00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:34.010
<v Speaker 1>like a bag genius,</v>

255
00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:34.933
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

256
00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:36.380
<v Speaker 1>Cause sometimes mean regular,</v>

257
00:08:36.381 --> 00:08:39.410
<v Speaker 1>fresh like oh little tell me your farts.</v>

258
00:08:39.411 --> 00:08:39.990
<v Speaker 1>Smell like,</v>

259
00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:42.120
<v Speaker 1>it sounded like last night I thought yesterday.</v>

260
00:08:42.121 --> 00:08:42.860
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

261
00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:43.071
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

262
00:08:43.071 --> 00:08:46.790
<v Speaker 1>when you stay away from seafood for awhile and then you reintroduce it,</v>

263
00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:48.560
<v Speaker 1>there's bacteria in like,</v>

264
00:08:48.561 --> 00:08:48.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

265
00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:51.170
<v Speaker 1>it's different since shellfish and Sushi.</v>

266
00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:52.243
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

267
00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:53.511
<v Speaker 1>I thought when,</v>

268
00:08:53.511 --> 00:08:53.860
<v Speaker 1>I guess the,</v>

269
00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:57.630
<v Speaker 1>when I farted it sounded somebody was throwing up like the part sounded like a</v>

270
00:08:57.631 --> 00:08:58.464
<v Speaker 1>guy going,</v>

271
00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:00.091
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

272
00:09:00.091 --> 00:09:00.261
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

273
00:09:00.261 --> 00:09:03.330
<v Speaker 1>I've only shaved my ass once in my life,</v>

274
00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:04.620
<v Speaker 1>but once I did,</v>

275
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:05.341
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

276
00:09:05.341 --> 00:09:06.960
<v Speaker 1>my fart sounded so different.</v>

277
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:07.410
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

278
00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:07.561
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

279
00:09:07.561 --> 00:09:10.050
<v Speaker 1>they were all like wet and sloppy hair,</v>

280
00:09:10.051 --> 00:09:10.950
<v Speaker 1>kind of different.</v>

281
00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:16.640
<v Speaker 1>The hair on your ass literally changes the way your farts smell or sound rather.</v>

282
00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:17.010
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

284
00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.230
<v Speaker 1>but they sound different.</v>

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:22.833
<v Speaker 1>Plop,</v>

286

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:24.783
<v Speaker 1>plop.</v>

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.850

295
00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:45.390

325
00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:30.870
<v Speaker 1>What is it about Fart?</v>

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:32.100
<v Speaker 1>So there is so hilarious.</v>

327
00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:35.160
<v Speaker 1>They're never not funny.</v>

328
00:10:35.161 --> 00:10:38.040
<v Speaker 1>They're never not entertaining taboo.</v>

329
00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:40.440
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to do them in front of strangers.</v>

330
00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:41.491
<v Speaker 1>The smell,</v>

331
00:10:41.491 --> 00:10:42.181
<v Speaker 1>the sound,</v>

00:10:42.181 --> 00:10:43.500
<v Speaker 1>everything's everything about it.</v>

335
00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:50.030
<v Speaker 1>I think that's all rooted in.</v>

336
00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:55.040
<v Speaker 1>If your household was okay with bars are not none growing up.</v>

398
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.720
<v Speaker 1>because he wants you to know how many calories he's eating but he's not that</v>

399
00:13:13.721 --> 00:13:14.001
<v Speaker 1>fat.</v>

400
00:13:14.001 --> 00:13:15.010

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:19.390
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't have some sort of Ralphie may thing going on.</v>

405
00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:21.100
<v Speaker 1>It's like remarkably obese.</v>

406
00:13:21.101 --> 00:13:21.700
<v Speaker 1>Sadly,</v>

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:26.700
<v Speaker 1>that guy lives his life like absolute shit every day and I'm fatter than him.</v>

409
00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:32.950
<v Speaker 1>And it was not that out of shape.</v>

410
00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:34.270
<v Speaker 1>But you think that's an act?</v>

411
00:13:34.271 --> 00:13:38.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe he's like some customer service representative for like Toyo Tires</v>

412
00:13:38.351 --> 00:13:39.184
<v Speaker 1>or someplace.</v>

413
00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:40.193
<v Speaker 1>I might agree.</v>

414
00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:42.880
<v Speaker 1>Have I not watched many of his films?</v>
