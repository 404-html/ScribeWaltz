1
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.110
<v Speaker 1>What a perfect time to have Lewis from unbox therapy on when our tri castors</v>

2
00:00:07.111 --> 00:00:12.111
<v Speaker 1>taking a big fat shit because we updated the software and then red band decides</v>

3
00:00:12.541 --> 00:00:15.720
<v Speaker 1>right before the show he's going to update his phone and it's going to take</v>

4
00:00:15.721 --> 00:00:20.721
<v Speaker 1>about 17 fucking hours right in the middle of someone from the DMV supposed to</v>

5
00:00:20.971 --> 00:00:21.804
<v Speaker 1>call him.</v>

6
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:23.730
<v Speaker 1>And that's never going to happen.</v>

7
00:00:23.731 --> 00:00:25.880
<v Speaker 1>Now I think you guys planned it this way.</v>

8
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.360
<v Speaker 1>You heard I was coming down and slept less.</v>

9
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.500
<v Speaker 1>Causes many technical difficulties as possible and then put him on it.</v>

10
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.280
<v Speaker 1>Let's see how much this guy really knows.</v>

11
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.533
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

12
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.020
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately the tricaster is a little outside the realm of my day to day.</v>

13
00:00:40.021 --> 00:00:40.854
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

14
00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:41.340
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

15
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.810
<v Speaker 1>which Jamie said,</v>

16
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:43.021
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

17
00:00:43.021 --> 00:00:44.430
<v Speaker 1>we've got to update the software.</v>

18
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:45.001
<v Speaker 1>So I go,</v>

19
00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:45.710
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

20
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.220
<v Speaker 1>And then I thought that I don't update shit.</v>

21
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:49.990
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

22
00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:54.990
<v Speaker 1>I will wait several versions before update my phone or you know,</v>

23
00:00:55.831 --> 00:00:57.210
<v Speaker 1>it always annoys me.</v>

24
00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:58.800
<v Speaker 1>Apple's always asking me to update.</v>

25
00:00:58.801 --> 00:00:59.011
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

26
00:00:59.011 --> 00:00:59.610
<v Speaker 1>no that's,</v>

27
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.320
<v Speaker 1>that's certainly the move,</v>

28
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.720
<v Speaker 1>if especially if it's like a mission critical thing,</v>

29
00:01:03.721 --> 00:01:04.710
<v Speaker 1>like your phone,</v>

30
00:01:04.711 --> 00:01:05.000
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

31
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
<v Speaker 1>your main device when you're waiting for a phone call or your try castor for</v>

32
00:01:10.171 --> 00:01:10.591
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>

33
00:01:10.591 --> 00:01:10.711
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

34
00:01:10.711 --> 00:01:11.491
<v Speaker 1>This fucking thing.</v>

35
00:01:11.491 --> 00:01:12.090
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

36
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.230
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ boy.</v>

37
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.701
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

38
00:01:14.701 --> 00:01:14.911
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

39
00:01:14.911 --> 00:01:15.690
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

40
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.430
<v Speaker 1>He was off post.</v>

41
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:19.920
<v Speaker 1>We have no video right now.</v>

42
00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

43
00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.043
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter.</v>

44
00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.390
<v Speaker 1>The video's not unused stream.</v>

45
00:01:23.391 --> 00:01:24.390
<v Speaker 1>It's not even going live,</v>

46
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.160
<v Speaker 1>so you fucked it twice.</v>

47
00:01:26.161 --> 00:01:27.030
<v Speaker 1>It's double fuck.</v>

48
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.460
<v Speaker 1>Terrific.</v>

49
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.811
<v Speaker 1>Terrific.</v>

50
00:01:30.811 --> 00:01:31.231
<v Speaker 1>Folks,</v>

51
00:01:31.231 --> 00:01:31.540
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

52
00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:32.850
<v Speaker 1>if you're doing this right now,</v>

53
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.770
<v Speaker 1>enjoy the blackness.</v>

54
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.400
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

55
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.020
<v Speaker 1>That's what all black lives matter,</v>

56
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.320
<v Speaker 1>including the black lives coming out of the fucking screens.</v>

57
00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:43.740
<v Speaker 1>How dare you.</v>

58
00:01:43.741 --> 00:01:46.140
<v Speaker 1>Jamie didn't even test this shit out.</v>

59
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.920
<v Speaker 1>How dare you anyway,</v>

60
00:01:49.921 --> 00:01:52.320
<v Speaker 1>for everybody looking at a blank screen right now,</v>

61
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.071
<v Speaker 1>like me,</v>

62
00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:54.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at the blank screen,</v>

63
00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:55.363
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

64
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.340
<v Speaker 1>most of the people unfortunately for you or audio only anyway,</v>

65
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.263
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

66
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.541
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

67
00:02:00.541 --> 00:02:01.021
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

68
00:02:01.021 --> 00:02:01.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

69
00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.681
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

70
00:02:01.681 --> 00:02:02.514
<v Speaker 1>after the fact.</v>

71
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.110
<v Speaker 1>Unbox therapy though,</v>

72
00:02:04.111 --> 00:02:05.280
<v Speaker 1>100 percent video.</v>

73
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

74
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:06.900
<v Speaker 1>very important to me.</v>

75
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.580
<v Speaker 1>So I can get by with audio on its own.</v>

76
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

77
00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.440
<v Speaker 1>We're supposed to be showing this Jamie,</v>

78
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:13.470
<v Speaker 1>like a periscope.</v>

79
00:02:13.471 --> 00:02:14.370
<v Speaker 1>It no</v>

80
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.240
<v Speaker 1>little side periscope angle.</v>

81
00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:19.563
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

82
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.581
<v Speaker 1>well okay.</v>

83
00:02:20.581 --> 00:02:21.910
<v Speaker 1>But what are we gonna do about the video?</v>

84
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.940
<v Speaker 1>The video's still recording on here,</v>

85
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.231
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

86
00:02:25.231 --> 00:02:29.850
<v Speaker 1>But it's not showing a record on here and we'll be able to put it on youtube.</v>

87
00:02:29.851 --> 00:02:34.450
<v Speaker 1>And you think maybe allegedly recording.</v>

88
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.371
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

89
00:02:35.371 --> 00:02:36.204
<v Speaker 1>Allegedly.</v>

90
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.300
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

91
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.340
<v Speaker 1>Nobody hears you talk.</v>

92
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.850
<v Speaker 1>I will.</v>

93
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.170
<v Speaker 1>I will draw the whole episode just in case the court reporter</v>

94
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:45.793
<v Speaker 1>trends</v>

95
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:47.790
<v Speaker 1>school tech.</v>

96
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.290
<v Speaker 1>So what is it you got here,</v>

97
00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.133
<v Speaker 1>man?</v>

98
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.300
<v Speaker 1>Virtual realities with this is fascinating for people who can't see this.</v>

99
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.800
<v Speaker 1>It's virtual reality.</v>

100
00:02:55.801 --> 00:02:58.500
<v Speaker 1>It's like a goggle set up with a.</v>

101
00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.220
<v Speaker 1>on the front of it is a galaxy</v>

102
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.970
<v Speaker 2>s six?</v>

103
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:01.361
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

104
00:03:01.361 --> 00:03:05.470
<v Speaker 2>So a Samsung galaxy phone is strapped to this headset.</v>

105
00:03:05.471 --> 00:03:08.320
<v Speaker 2>So the screen is your field of view.</v>

106
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:09.011
<v Speaker 2>That's right,</v>

107
00:03:09.011 --> 00:03:09.221
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

108
00:03:09.221 --> 00:03:10.300
<v Speaker 2>And there's two lenses there,</v>

109
00:03:10.301 --> 00:03:11.710
<v Speaker 2>so I'll just open it up real quick.</v>

110
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.930
<v Speaker 2>So the phone sits in and clips out.</v>

111
00:03:13.931 --> 00:03:17.200
<v Speaker 2>Obviously you still want to use it as a regular phone and those are the lenses</v>

112
00:03:17.201 --> 00:03:18.700
<v Speaker 2>that will allow you to focus,</v>

113
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.510
<v Speaker 2>focus in on the display at an incredibly close range.</v>

114
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.170
<v Speaker 2>Now the nerds out there that they talk a lot about the resolution of phones and</v>

115
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:30.580
<v Speaker 2>some say,</v>

116
00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.630
<v Speaker 2>oh well there's no need to have a phone with a display beyond 10 80 p,</v>

117
00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:35.081
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

118
00:03:35.081 --> 00:03:36.490
<v Speaker 2>because at this range here,</v>

119
00:03:36.491 --> 00:03:38.140
<v Speaker 2>you would never notice those pixels,</v>

120
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:41.560
<v Speaker 2>but the minute you stick them in an environment like this,</v>

121
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.870
<v Speaker 2>just an inch away from your eyeball,</v>

122
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.770
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden you can discern those pixels that you couldn't add phone usage</v>

123
00:03:47.771 --> 00:03:48.604
<v Speaker 2>range.</v>

124
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.160
<v Speaker 2>What happens with people who wear glasses,</v>

125
00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.260
<v Speaker 2>your glasses can fit in there.</v>

126
00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.860
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

127
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:54.031
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

128
00:03:54.031 --> 00:03:55.390
<v Speaker 2>You can go with glasses in there.</v>

129
00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.720
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

130
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.770
<v Speaker 2>there's a focus on the top here so you can actually focus them in,</v>

131
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

132
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.950
<v Speaker 2>depending on what vision correction,</v>

133
00:04:02.951 --> 00:04:04.150
<v Speaker 2>whatever you have going on.</v>

134
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:05.290
<v Speaker 2>I've used it with glasses,</v>

135
00:04:05.291 --> 00:04:06.190
<v Speaker 2>contact lenses,</v>

136
00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.560
<v Speaker 2>so you can adjust it like a pair of binoculars.</v>

137
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:09.453
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

138
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

139
00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:10.150
<v Speaker 2>Be.</v>

140
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

141
00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:10.931
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

142
00:04:10.931 --> 00:04:11.291
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

143
00:04:11.291 --> 00:04:11.950
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

144
00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.100
<v Speaker 2>the cool thing in this particular case compared to like some of the other stuff</v>

145
00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.690
<v Speaker 2>that I've shown off before,</v>

146
00:04:16.691 --> 00:04:20.830
<v Speaker 2>like Google cardboard and the really inexpensive ones is that since this is</v>

147
00:04:20.831 --> 00:04:23.110
<v Speaker 2>designed specifically for this device,</v>

148
00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.320
<v Speaker 2>you get a touch interface touchpad for controlling taps and stuff and this size</v>

149
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:29.231
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

150
00:04:29.231 --> 00:04:29.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

151
00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.780
<v Speaker 2>So that's just like the bottom of your laptop,</v>

152
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.090
<v Speaker 2>sort of like a leg,</v>

153
00:04:33.091 --> 00:04:34.150
<v Speaker 2>a little little click pad,</v>

154
00:04:34.151 --> 00:04:35.830
<v Speaker 2>track pad kind of situation.</v>

155
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.780
<v Speaker 2>So you have a little bit of interactivity there.</v>

156
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.380
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

157
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.951
<v Speaker 2>other than that,</v>

158
00:04:38.951 --> 00:04:39.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean it,</v>

159
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.470
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

160
00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:40.270
<v Speaker 2>it sort of,</v>

161
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.850
<v Speaker 2>it sort of does what it looks like it does.</v>

162
00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:43.540
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

163
00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:44.740
<v Speaker 2>do you think we should try it out or what?</v>

164
00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.921
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

165
00:04:44.921 --> 00:04:45.281
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>

166
00:04:45.281 --> 00:04:45.810
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

167
00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.931
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

168
00:04:45.931 --> 00:04:49.210
<v Speaker 2>it's cool at this stuff was finally coming to light now because this was always</v>

169
00:04:49.211 --> 00:04:50.080
<v Speaker 2>when we were kids,</v>

170
00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:51.580
<v Speaker 2>we thought this was the future.</v>

171
00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.260
<v Speaker 2>I think it's still is.</v>

172
00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.501
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

173
00:04:53.501 --> 00:04:53.690
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

174
00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.520
<v Speaker 2>it just took a while for the technology to catch up to,</v>

175
00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

176
00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.140
<v Speaker 2>what we expected from it.</v>

177
00:04:59.141 --> 00:04:59.830
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to get it.</v>

178
00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:00.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get it set up here.</v>

179
00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.330
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

180
00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.960
<v Speaker 2>Let me just,</v>

181
00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.800
<v Speaker 2>I got a call from Duncan trussell once he came back from some conference that</v>

182
00:05:05.801 --> 00:05:07.720
<v Speaker 2>they had on virtual reality and uh,</v>

183
00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.930
<v Speaker 2>I'll never forget this because I'll stand in front of the Improv and he's</v>

184
00:05:09.931 --> 00:05:10.360
<v Speaker 2>screaming,</v>

185
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.050
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

186
00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:12.580
<v Speaker 1>this is bigger than the fucking wheel.</v>

187
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:14.380
<v Speaker 1>Bigger than the Internet.</v>

188
00:05:14.381 --> 00:05:15.400
<v Speaker 1>It's bigger than everything,</v>

189
00:05:15.401 --> 00:05:15.940
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

190
00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.500
<v Speaker 1>This is a fucking game changer,</v>

191
00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.831
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

192
00:05:17.831 --> 00:05:19.210
<v Speaker 1>It's a fucking game changer.</v>

193
00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.040
<v Speaker 1>It's the virtual reality.</v>

194
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:22.360
<v Speaker 1>It's what the future is.</v>

195
00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:23.220
<v Speaker 1>He had just gotten</v>

196
00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.530
<v Speaker 2>back from la checking out the newest oculus rift.</v>

197
00:05:25.531 --> 00:05:26.550
<v Speaker 2>The one that you were talking about,</v>

198
00:05:26.551 --> 00:05:27.870
<v Speaker 2>the piano demonstration.</v>

199
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:28.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

200
00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:29.340
<v Speaker 2>So that one.</v>

201
00:05:29.341 --> 00:05:30.031
<v Speaker 2>Is the mic here.</v>

202
00:05:30.031 --> 00:05:30.271
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>

203
00:05:30.271 --> 00:05:31.770
<v Speaker 2>I can't see anything anymore.</v>

204
00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:32.813
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

205
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.640
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

206
00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:34.000
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

207
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.600
<v Speaker 2>this one was built sort of in conjunction with Oculus.</v>

208
00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:41.660
<v Speaker 2>So there is an oculus store and library app that you boot into when you put the</v>

209
00:05:42.301 --> 00:05:43.380
<v Speaker 2>phone into the,</v>

210
00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:44.250
<v Speaker 2>into the headset.</v>

211
00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:49.230
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of the demos that are available on Oculus are also available here.</v>

212
00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:50.753
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to bring up.</v>

213
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:55.170
<v Speaker 2>I'll bring up that one with the piano and then I'll let you check that out.</v>

214
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.351
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

215
00:05:55.351 --> 00:05:56.910
<v Speaker 2>you can do it right from that.</v>

216
00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:57.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

217
00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.670
<v Speaker 2>So that's as good as oculus rift.</v>

218
00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:00.260
<v Speaker 2>While I wouldn't go that far,</v>

219
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:05.320
<v Speaker 2>I would say it's more convenient than oculus rift and probably arguably more of</v>

220
00:06:05.931 --> 00:06:09.340
<v Speaker 2>a game changer in the sense that people don't have to go out and buy these</v>

221
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:14.350
<v Speaker 2>standalone expensive headset and then have a dedicated pc to use it.</v>

222
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.250
<v Speaker 2>Everyone has a phone.</v>

223
00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:16.581
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

224
00:06:16.581 --> 00:06:18.710
<v Speaker 2>So you're already halfway there.</v>

225
00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:21.050
<v Speaker 2>This fear doesn't have a phone anymore.</v>

226
00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.440
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

227
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:22.273
<v Speaker 2>I heard about that.</v>

228
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:23.970
<v Speaker 2>I heard about that.</v>

229
00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:26.870
<v Speaker 2>Do you feel about that when someone fucking completely bales,</v>

230
00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:28.720
<v Speaker 2>since you're such a technical job?</v>

231
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:29.510
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>

232
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:30.343
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

233
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.700
<v Speaker 2>for folks who don't know where you're talking about already should fear,</v>

234
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:33.920
<v Speaker 2>gave up on smartphones,</v>

235
00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:34.970
<v Speaker 2>just uses a flip phone.</v>

236
00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.490
<v Speaker 2>I kind of get it because I feel like I'm so immersed in,</v>

237
00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:43.340
<v Speaker 2>in tech sometimes that I would love to take a step away for a minute.</v>

238
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:43.551
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

239
00:06:43.551 --> 00:06:44.630
<v Speaker 2>you just booted that phone up.</v>

240
00:06:44.631 --> 00:06:46.030
<v Speaker 2>You said you hadn't booted it in a while.</v>

241
00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:48.670
<v Speaker 2>Texts were coming in and.</v>

242
00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:49.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

243
00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:49.953
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

244
00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:50.863
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

245
00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:54.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean it would be really a really interesting experiment to see like how many</v>

246
00:06:54.981 --> 00:06:56.810
<v Speaker 2>times that thing interrupts my day.</v>

247
00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.730
<v Speaker 2>Like a smartphone because it's probably,</v>

248
00:06:58.731 --> 00:06:59.151
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

249
00:06:59.151 --> 00:07:01.120
<v Speaker 2>a thousand times maybe like it's,</v>

250
00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:02.000
<v Speaker 2>it really has,</v>

251
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:04.010
<v Speaker 2>it really trains you like a,</v>

252
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:04.891
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>

253
00:07:04.891 --> 00:07:07.250
<v Speaker 2>a buzz collar on an animal or something like that.</v>

254
00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:08.031
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>

255
00:07:08.031 --> 00:07:09.320
<v Speaker 2>you want to stick this on and check it out?</v>

256
00:07:09.321 --> 00:07:10.154
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

257
00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:13.250
<v Speaker 2>So it looks cool for people who would just listen to at home.</v>

258
00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:18.210
<v Speaker 2>It looks like something storm troopers would wear plastic and uh,</v>

259
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:20.330
<v Speaker 2>you can strap so you can tighten it.</v>

260
00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:21.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you feel</v>

261
00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:24.170
<v Speaker 2>it's a good look on you.</v>

262
00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:26.900
<v Speaker 2>I think something came off.</v>

263
00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:27.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

264
00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:27.650
<v Speaker 2>it just goes,</v>

265
00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:29.900
<v Speaker 2>it just slips through note right there yet.</v>

266
00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:30.793
<v Speaker 2>Just like a pair of.</v>

267
00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:31.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

268
00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:32.360
<v Speaker 2>just like a pair of.</v>

269
00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:33.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

270
00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:34.010
<v Speaker 2>Oh I see.</v>

271
00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:34.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

272
00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:36.950
<v Speaker 2>It's like a pair of ski goggles pretty much.</v>

273
00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:39.920
<v Speaker 2>Now you said this also has bluetooth so you can hook up like headphones</v>

274
00:07:39.921 --> 00:07:41.120
<v Speaker 2>wirelessly also.</v>

275
00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:41.541
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

276
00:07:41.541 --> 00:07:45.980
<v Speaker 2>So every capability that the phone has is still theoretically active,</v>

277
00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:47.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

278
00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:50.420
<v Speaker 2>so are you focusing in yet?</v>

279
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:55.810
<v Speaker 2>So try and find the spot where the text is a text on screen right now.</v>

280
00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:58.280
<v Speaker 2>Touch the touch pad to resume.</v>

281
00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.233
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>

282
00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:01.130
<v Speaker 2>Are you in that space right now?</v>

283
00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:03.531
<v Speaker 2>That's better.</v>

284
00:08:03.531 --> 00:08:04.790
<v Speaker 2>It's better with sound,</v>

285
00:08:04.791 --> 00:08:06.200
<v Speaker 2>but it's still pretty good.</v>

286
00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:07.610
<v Speaker 2>And if you,</v>

287
00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:09.550
<v Speaker 2>if you kind of watch this guy play the.</v>

288
00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:10.850
<v Speaker 2>See if you can find the dog.</v>

289
00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:11.743
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

290
00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:13.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah man.</v>

291
00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:14.343
<v Speaker 2>I</v>

292
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:18.290
<v Speaker 2>chose people who are just.</v>

293
00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:19.670
<v Speaker 2>They don't know what I'm doing here.</v>

294
00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:21.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking around the room.</v>

295
00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:25.970
<v Speaker 2>At first I'm just looking at this guy played piano and it's kind of cool.</v>

296
00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:27.800
<v Speaker 2>Although he is a little annoying.</v>

297
00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:31.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't like to waste things.</v>

298
00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:32.390
<v Speaker 2>Do you see the smoke?</v>

299
00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:34.760
<v Speaker 2>Do you see the smoke coming off his cigarette in the ashtray?</v>

300
00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:36.170
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

301
00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:38.150
<v Speaker 2>it's beside the piano there.</v>

302
00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:39.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

303
00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.300
<v Speaker 2>it's slightly pixelated.</v>

304
00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:42.770
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say it's perfect.</v>

305
00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:43.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

306
00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:44.040
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

307
00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:45.530
<v Speaker 2>it's not high resolution,</v>

308
00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.970
<v Speaker 2>but I heard that the Oculus version is when you pitch,</v>

309
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:50.360
<v Speaker 2>it looks at you every now and then.</v>

310
00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:54.050
<v Speaker 2>This is so fucking strange.</v>

311
00:08:54.051 --> 00:08:55.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking around this guy studio.</v>

312
00:08:55.831 --> 00:08:56.641
<v Speaker 2>He has this,</v>

313
00:08:56.641 --> 00:08:56.821
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

314
00:08:56.821 --> 00:08:58.350
<v Speaker 2>recording studio here.</v>

315
00:08:58.500 --> 00:08:59.311
<v Speaker 2>I'm just kidding about him.</v>

316
00:08:59.311 --> 00:09:00.150
<v Speaker 2>Annoying me by the way.</v>

317
00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:01.013
<v Speaker 2>I'm just trying to be funny.</v>

318
00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:03.840
<v Speaker 2>And then he puts his phone in his ashtray.</v>

319
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:05.670
<v Speaker 2>Let's throw in shit on the ground.</v>

320
00:09:05.671 --> 00:09:07.050
<v Speaker 2>I guess he's acting.</v>

321
00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:07.571
<v Speaker 2>He's acting.</v>

322
00:09:07.571 --> 00:09:07.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

323
00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:07.941
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

324
00:09:07.941 --> 00:09:08.090
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

325
00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:08.340
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

326
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:09.151
<v Speaker 2>he knows what he's doing.</v>

327
00:09:09.151 --> 00:09:10.740
<v Speaker 2>He has a three 60 camera there,</v>

328
00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:16.050
<v Speaker 2>but he's got a fake tree in his room and as you look around his studio,</v>

329
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.780
<v Speaker 2>like everywhere you look you can see stuff.</v>

330
00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:19.680
<v Speaker 2>This is the real.</v>

331
00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:24.860
<v Speaker 2>What's really a game changer about this technology is that it's really 360</v>

332
00:09:25.621 --> 00:09:26.250
<v Speaker 2>degrees.</v>

333
00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:26.610
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

334
00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:27.450
<v Speaker 2>Like as you,</v>

335
00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:28.651
<v Speaker 2>as you look,</v>

336
00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:29.461
<v Speaker 2>everywhere you look,</v>

337
00:09:29.461 --> 00:09:33.630
<v Speaker 2>there's something to look at [inaudible] and that is fucking strange man.</v>

338
00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:34.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

339
00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:36.390
<v Speaker 2>If they do this with movies,</v>

340
00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:38.910
<v Speaker 2>to watch movies over and over again because you'll,</v>

341
00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:40.190
<v Speaker 2>you'll be able to look at it from different.</v>

342
00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:40.471
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

343
00:09:40.471 --> 00:09:42.630
<v Speaker 2>Now I see the smoke a cigarette.</v>

344
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:43.553
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>

345
00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:46.320
<v Speaker 2>I have a feeling he makes really whiny music.</v>

346
00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:47.670
<v Speaker 2>While you're probably right,</v>

347
00:09:47.671 --> 00:09:48.181
<v Speaker 2>to be honest,</v>

348
00:09:48.181 --> 00:09:49.350
<v Speaker 2>I really wasn't listening.</v>

349
00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:51.090
<v Speaker 2>It was more about the visual.</v>

350
00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:51.931
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

351
00:09:51.931 --> 00:09:53.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of glad I can hear him saying.</v>

352
00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:54.590
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

353
00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:56.100
<v Speaker 2>there's another one in there,</v>

354
00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:57.090
<v Speaker 2>another demo,</v>

355
00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:02.320
<v Speaker 2>which is you sitting inside a movie theater and so you see the,</v>

356
00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:02.720
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

357
00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:03.040
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

358
00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:08.040
<v Speaker 2>the seats around you as the trailer plays on the make believe movie screen,</v>

359
00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:14.660
<v Speaker 2>the colors coming off of it are reflecting off the seats and it gives you an</v>

360
00:10:15.391 --> 00:10:19.020
<v Speaker 2>incredible feeling of the exact vibe of being inside of a theater.</v>

361
00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:23.070
<v Speaker 2>I have the original oculus left and that was one of my biggest,</v>

362
00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:26.950
<v Speaker 2>what I say lift that uh,</v>

363
00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.470
<v Speaker 2>it was really pixelated.</v>

364
00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:31.020
<v Speaker 2>I get the idea how cool it was.</v>

365
00:10:31.021 --> 00:10:31.261
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

366
00:10:31.261 --> 00:10:34.880
<v Speaker 2>is that comparable to that or is this more many levels better?</v>

367
00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:35.783
<v Speaker 2>Better than that one.</v>

368
00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:39.840
<v Speaker 2>Put it on it's many levels better than the pixelated one that Duncan had.</v>

369
00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:43.980
<v Speaker 2>Duncan has a series of one which was like A.</v>

370
00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:44.460
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

371
00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:44.641
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

372
00:10:44.641 --> 00:10:46.530
<v Speaker 2>I think they were like vga screens for some.</v>

373
00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:47.970
<v Speaker 2>I might be wrong about that,</v>

374
00:10:47.971 --> 00:10:48.804
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

375
00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.370
<v Speaker 2>playing doom.</v>

376
00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:50.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

377
00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:51.960
<v Speaker 2>the old school day.</v>

378
00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:52.171
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

379
00:10:52.171 --> 00:10:52.351
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

380
00:10:52.351 --> 00:10:52.710
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

381
00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:56.400
<v Speaker 2>But you kind of got a sense that this was a game changer.</v>

382
00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:56.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

383
00:10:56.890 --> 00:10:58.930
<v Speaker 2>Because even though it was so pixilated like,</v>

384
00:10:58.940 --> 00:10:59.340
<v Speaker 2>well though,</v>

385
00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:00.420
<v Speaker 2>they're going to work that out.</v>

386
00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:02.550
<v Speaker 2>They're going to try and walk around.</v>

387
00:11:02.551 --> 00:11:03.780
<v Speaker 2>This is dangerous right now.</v>

388
00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:04.051
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

389
00:11:04.051 --> 00:11:05.250
<v Speaker 2>Don't walk into the TV.</v>

390
00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:07.480
<v Speaker 2>Just stand still.</v>

391
00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:08.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

392
00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:09.570
<v Speaker 2>the dog looks cool.</v>

393
00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:10.201
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

394
00:11:10.201 --> 00:11:11.670
<v Speaker 2>Don't talk off mike either.</v>

395
00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:13.110
<v Speaker 2>Ready to touch your dog.</v>

396
00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:14.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

397
00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:15.300
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

398
00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:16.260
<v Speaker 2>And the thing and you know,</v>

399
00:11:16.261 --> 00:11:18.630
<v Speaker 2>part of the conversation here is about content too.</v>

400
00:11:18.631 --> 00:11:19.260
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

401
00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:19.501
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

402
00:11:19.501 --> 00:11:20.370
<v Speaker 2>how does stuff,</v>

403
00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:25.430
<v Speaker 2>how do you go from having a piece of video and turning it into 360 degree video</v>

404
00:11:26.341 --> 00:11:29.970
<v Speaker 2>like he's watching right there and we're seeing more and more.</v>

405
00:11:29.971 --> 00:11:31.680
<v Speaker 2>Three 60 cameras come out now.</v>

406
00:11:31.681 --> 00:11:33.650
<v Speaker 2>There's a one from Google called jump,</v>

407
00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:36.780
<v Speaker 2>which is this crazy gopro contraption you may have seen.</v>

408
00:11:36.781 --> 00:11:41.030
<v Speaker 2>It's a six or more a Gopro hero fours,</v>

409
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:42.660
<v Speaker 2>which have an incredible field of view.</v>

410
00:11:42.661 --> 00:11:43.560
<v Speaker 2>And then softwares.</v>

411
00:11:43.561 --> 00:11:44.850
<v Speaker 2>What stitches it all together,</v>

412
00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:46.890
<v Speaker 2>which is the experience you're seeing in there.</v>

413
00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:49.750
<v Speaker 2>So theoretically it's not just a,</v>

414
00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:50.370
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

415
00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:51.930
<v Speaker 2>games and digital things,</v>

416
00:11:51.931 --> 00:11:52.680
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

417
00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:57.230
<v Speaker 2>in the people will shoot video in three 60 and enjoy it in place.</v>

418
00:11:57.850 --> 00:11:58.001
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

419
00:11:58.001 --> 00:11:58.570
<v Speaker 2>that's what I was saying.</v>

420
00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:02.020
<v Speaker 2>Like they can do that with movies like and you could see the same movie over and</v>

421
00:12:02.021 --> 00:12:04.780
<v Speaker 2>over again and you'll decide to go outside.</v>

422
00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:06.880
<v Speaker 2>You'll decide to go on the porch,</v>

423
00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:07.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

424
00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:08.680
<v Speaker 2>you'll decide there'll be seen.</v>

425
00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:12.340
<v Speaker 2>It's like you go on the porch and the wife and her sister are going to be</v>

426
00:12:12.341 --> 00:12:13.450
<v Speaker 2>fighting like that.</v>

427
00:12:13.451 --> 00:12:14.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking leaving him.</v>

428
00:12:14.441 --> 00:12:15.320
<v Speaker 2>I can't take it anymore.</v>

429
00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:18.440
<v Speaker 2>And the guys in the bathroom shooting heroin will peak in the bathroom.</v>

430
00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:19.300
<v Speaker 2>We're shooting heroin,</v>

431
00:12:19.301 --> 00:12:19.720
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

432
00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:19.941
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

433
00:12:19.941 --> 00:12:21.500
<v Speaker 2>Like why I chose that scene.</v>

434
00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:22.900
<v Speaker 2>Sounds pretty intense.</v>

435
00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:24.860
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

436
00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:29.850
<v Speaker 2>let you choose your own adventure type scenario mysteries where you're like</v>

437
00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:33.760
<v Speaker 2>opening up cupboards to look for like little pieces of if you like watching it</v>

438
00:12:33.761 --> 00:12:34.331
<v Speaker 2>at home.</v>

439
00:12:34.331 --> 00:12:37.510
<v Speaker 2>Especially if you can actually move around like on a unit directional.</v>

440
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:41.220
<v Speaker 2>If you get one of the unit directional treadmills that operate based on union</v>

441
00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:42.063
<v Speaker 2>your movement.</v>

442
00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:42.640
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

443
00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:44.140
<v Speaker 2>They're getting better and better with those.</v>

444
00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:45.131
<v Speaker 2>They used to be.</v>

445
00:12:45.131 --> 00:12:46.450
<v Speaker 2>You got strapped in.</v>

446
00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:46.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

447
00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:47.430
<v Speaker 2>I've tried one.</v>

448
00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:48.700
<v Speaker 2>Kind of hold onto the thing,</v>

449
00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:50.290
<v Speaker 2>but they're getting better.</v>

450
00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:50.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

451
00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:54.700
<v Speaker 2>And now I think they're developing ones that are detecting which way you're</v>

452
00:12:54.701 --> 00:12:56.020
<v Speaker 2>standing and walking,</v>

453
00:12:56.410 --> 00:13:00.730
<v Speaker 2>so they will move accordingly with you and then eventually they'll get to a</v>

454
00:13:00.731 --> 00:13:04.780
<v Speaker 2>point where it's going to be indistinguishable between walking outside and</v>

455
00:13:04.781 --> 00:13:05.591
<v Speaker 2>walking on this unit.</v>

456
00:13:05.591 --> 00:13:07.040
<v Speaker 2>Directional Readville yeah.</v>

457
00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:08.740
<v Speaker 2>As long as everything's flat.</v>

458
00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:13.120
<v Speaker 2>Once you start going uphill and then rugged terrain,</v>

459
00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:14.380
<v Speaker 2>things are going to be.</v>

460
00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:15.213
<v Speaker 2>That's not going to work.</v>

461
00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:16.450
<v Speaker 2>Kind of adjustment.</v>

462
00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:17.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

463
00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:18.400
<v Speaker 2>Like hiking.</v>

464
00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:18.911
<v Speaker 2>Like you'll,</v>

465
00:13:18.911 --> 00:13:20.010
<v Speaker 2>you're never really going to be like,</v>

466
00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:20.853
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

467
00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:22.620
<v Speaker 2>the grounds off a little bit.</v>

468
00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:27.100
<v Speaker 2>Part of the thing though about it is like I think a lot of people who are into</v>

469
00:13:27.101 --> 00:13:31.900
<v Speaker 2>this for consumption are lean back type situations anyways.</v>

470
00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:32.470
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

471
00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:36.340
<v Speaker 2>Like it will be like having an exercise show on television.</v>

472
00:13:36.341 --> 00:13:36.551
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

473
00:13:36.551 --> 00:13:40.330
<v Speaker 2>how many people actually participate compared to just want to sit there like</v>

474
00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:43.390
<v Speaker 2>prevention of those that Denise Austin.</v>

475
00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:44.301
<v Speaker 2>You remember her?</v>

476
00:13:44.301 --> 00:13:44.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

477
00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:44.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

478
00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:47.560
<v Speaker 2>They used to have all these like you'd work out along,</v>

479
00:13:47.561 --> 00:13:51.040
<v Speaker 2>like get up there on xbox now.</v>

480
00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:54.340
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember the Israeli guy on the beach was always really ripped.</v>

481
00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:55.600
<v Speaker 2>No handsome guy.</v>

482
00:13:55.601 --> 00:13:56.390
<v Speaker 2>Black hair.</v>

483
00:13:56.390 --> 00:13:58.690
<v Speaker 2>He's to have this workout and get everybody pumped up.</v>

484
00:13:59.020 --> 00:13:59.440
<v Speaker 2>You don't remember.</v>

485
00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:01.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I've ever watched Jane Fonda,</v>

486
00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:03.123
<v Speaker 2>Jane Fonda,</v>

487
00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:04.380
<v Speaker 2>she had videotapes.</v>

488
00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:07.330
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if you got into the videotape business like couple days ago,</v>

489
00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:10.210
<v Speaker 2>like I'm a fucking set the world on DVD.</v>

490
00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:15.340
<v Speaker 2>I watched the DVD last night and I forgot the resolution on those are shit when</v>

491
00:14:15.341 --> 00:14:16.690
<v Speaker 2>you're watching on a big screen.</v>

492
00:14:16.691 --> 00:14:17.930
<v Speaker 2>I've never realized regular,</v>

493
00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.510
<v Speaker 2>regular duty for 80.</v>

494
00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:24.190
<v Speaker 2>I got an email from a company that was offering to transcode all of my youtube</v>

495
00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:25.660
<v Speaker 2>videos into dvds.</v>

496
00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:26.400
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>

497
00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:26.710
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

498
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:27.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm probably good.</v>

499
00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:30.210
<v Speaker 2>We'll get it.</v>

500
00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:31.400
<v Speaker 2>Set him off smoke.</v>

501
00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:32.243
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

502
00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:36.790
<v Speaker 2>it was like this huge spiel about how the DVD market is not dead yet.</v>

503
00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:37.390
<v Speaker 2>And he could,</v>

504
00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:37.631
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

505
00:14:37.631 --> 00:14:40.530
<v Speaker 2>you could serve as people who don't have connectivity or something.</v>

506
00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:41.300
<v Speaker 2>It looks like it's working,</v>

507
00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:41.940
<v Speaker 2>Jimmy.</v>

508
00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:42.773
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

509
00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:43.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

510
00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:43.810
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

511
00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:44.643
<v Speaker 2>Hooray.</v>

512
00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:46.331
<v Speaker 2>You figured it out.</v>

513
00:14:46.331 --> 00:14:47.164
<v Speaker 2>You fuck.</v>

514
00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:48.593
<v Speaker 2>Go Jog.</v>

515
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:49.863
<v Speaker 2>Yay.</v>

516
00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:50.690
<v Speaker 2>We're here.</v>

517
00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:51.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

518
00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:54.380
<v Speaker 2>So we're alive allegedly for now who knows?</v>

519
00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:56.480
<v Speaker 2>He might not be working.</v>

520
00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:01.960
<v Speaker 2>So this is like maybe one step in this ultimate 3d reality reality where yeah,</v>

521
00:15:04.821 --> 00:15:07.460
<v Speaker 2>where consumption for us turns into this.</v>

522
00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:08.210
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

523
00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:10.460
<v Speaker 2>this three dimensional thing instead of two dimensional,</v>

524
00:15:10.461 --> 00:15:12.410
<v Speaker 2>we dealt with two dimensional now for what?</v>

525
00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:17.500
<v Speaker 2>A eight 70 years or however long a black and white long man.</v>

526
00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:19.580
<v Speaker 2>I really stop and think about it.</v>

527
00:15:19.581 --> 00:15:22.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's probably been more than that because what was silent movies?</v>

528
00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:23.810
<v Speaker 2>There was the 19 tens.</v>

529
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:25.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

530
00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:27.900
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

531
00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:28.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

532
00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:28.791
<v Speaker 2>maybe tens.</v>

533
00:15:28.791 --> 00:15:29.510
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

534
00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:30.550
<v Speaker 2>I honestly don't know.</v>

535
00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:34.130
<v Speaker 2>But think about the amount of time it wasn't that like 19.</v>

536
00:15:34.131 --> 00:15:34.251
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

537
00:15:34.251 --> 00:15:35.570
<v Speaker 2>four or some crazy shit.</v>

538
00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:37.070
<v Speaker 2>That would be amazing if that's true.</v>

539
00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:39.020
<v Speaker 2>The earliest silent movie.</v>

540
00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:39.651
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

541
00:15:39.651 --> 00:15:42.950
<v Speaker 2>but before that they had still images.</v>

542
00:15:42.951 --> 00:15:43.311
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

543
00:15:43.311 --> 00:15:46.400
<v Speaker 2>So you had photographs and they went from photographs</v>

544
00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:47.611
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

545
00:15:47.611 --> 00:15:48.610
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

546
00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:49.660
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

547
00:15:49.661 --> 00:15:50.494
<v Speaker 1>Where we off?</v>

548
00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:52.270
<v Speaker 1>Holy Fuck Man.</v>

549
00:15:52.271 --> 00:15:52.930
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

550
00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:55.310
<v Speaker 1>That was um.</v>

551
00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:56.480
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

552
00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:57.640
<v Speaker 1>that's just the first one.</v>

553
00:15:58.090 --> 00:15:59.260
<v Speaker 1>Well the first one,</v>

554
00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:00.213
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

555
00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:05.140
<v Speaker 1>the first talkie was the jazz singer in 1927.</v>

556
00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:07.510
<v Speaker 1>He imagined like in Nineteen,</v>

557
00:16:07.511 --> 00:16:11.710
<v Speaker 1>27 people sat down like jogging because they had audio now.</v>

558
00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:12.850
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

559
00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:14.620
<v Speaker 1>And they probably had a sync it up.</v>

560
00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:15.251
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

561
00:16:15.251 --> 00:16:15.671
<v Speaker 1>you remember?</v>

562
00:16:15.671 --> 00:16:20.671
<v Speaker 1>That was like always the big thing with a right movies that were sinked up bad.</v>

563
00:16:20.711 --> 00:16:24.940
<v Speaker 1>The sound was linked up to the lips didn't match.</v>

564
00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:29.500
<v Speaker 1>The still happens now is go to youtube and there's a video.</v>

565
00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:30.220
<v Speaker 1>We can't show it.</v>

566
00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:31.210
<v Speaker 1>Can we show it on this?</v>

567
00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:32.501
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

568
00:16:32.501 --> 00:16:33.370
<v Speaker 1>it's still fucking up.</v>

569
00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:34.263
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

570
00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:36.760
<v Speaker 1>Not when is Nosferatu when?</v>

571
00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:39.670
<v Speaker 1>I want to say Nosferatu was like early,</v>

572
00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:41.560
<v Speaker 1>early 19 hundreds,</v>

573
00:16:41.561 --> 00:16:44.480
<v Speaker 1>but it might've been yet 20 to 22,</v>

574
00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:44.921
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

575
00:16:44.921 --> 00:16:49.120
<v Speaker 1>22 fucking dope movies still to this day.</v>

576
00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:54.270
<v Speaker 1>Like that vampire was a good vampires for back then it was like they did it and</v>

577
00:16:55.031 --> 00:16:58.120
<v Speaker 1>they couldn't show much back then because it was obviously it was black and</v>

578
00:16:58.121 --> 00:16:58.451
<v Speaker 1>white,</v>

579
00:16:58.451 --> 00:17:00.880
<v Speaker 1>but it's also if you look real close you'd be like,</v>

580
00:17:00.881 --> 00:17:01.490
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

581
00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:02.323
<v Speaker 1>The makeup,</v>

582
00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:05.560
<v Speaker 1>that long creepy fingers.</v>

583
00:17:05.561 --> 00:17:08.870
<v Speaker 1>And he was like some prominent actor of the time if I'm really.</v>

584
00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:09.843
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

585
00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:10.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

586
00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:12.790
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'm no expert,</v>

587
00:17:12.791 --> 00:17:13.241
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

588

594
00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:25.580
<v Speaker 2>very creepy.</v>

595
00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:26.750
<v Speaker 2>Very creepy.</v>

596
00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:28.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean when you think about 19,</v>

00:17:31.941 --> 00:17:32.181
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

601
00:17:32.181 --> 00:17:34.550
<v Speaker 2>you really have to appreciate what it used to take.</v>

602
00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:35.210

<v Speaker 2>Unbelievable.</v>

625
00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:04.650
<v Speaker 2>Unbelievable.</v>

626
00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:05.483
<v Speaker 2>I like that guy.</v>

627
00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:06.533
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

628
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:07.470
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

629
00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:11.580
<v Speaker 2>See I would splurge for him to be the leading men and independent states as</v>

630
00:18:11.581 --> 00:18:11.750
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

631
00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:14.220
<v Speaker 2>We must save the world just like Florida.</v>

632
00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:15.233
<v Speaker 2>Basically.</v>

633
00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:16.260
<v Speaker 2>It was beautiful hair,</v>

634
00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:17.250
<v Speaker 2>but anyhow,</v>

635
00:18:17.251 --> 00:18:22.251
<v Speaker 2>I went there and I mean we shot like we shop for 13 hours for about 20 seconds</v>

636
00:18:23.791 --> 00:18:27.690
<v Speaker 2>of what it'll actually be in the film and everything is blue screen.</v>

637
00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:29.760
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing around you anywhere.</v>

638
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.770
<v Speaker 2>They spend a say a year shooting it and then another year in post production</v>

639
00:18:34.771 --> 00:18:37.800
<v Speaker 2>just painting everything in artificially.</v>

640
00:18:37.801 --> 00:18:38.700
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

641
00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:39.450
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

642
00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:41.160
<v Speaker 2>you have to kind of appreciate that.</v>

643
00:18:41.161 --> 00:18:43.140
<v Speaker 2>Back then if they wanted something,</v>

644
00:18:43.141 --> 00:18:43.920
<v Speaker 2>it had to happen.</v>

645
00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:47.740
<v Speaker 2>Then we had to do it right there in the art,</v>

646
00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:48.930
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

647
00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:49.111
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

648
00:18:49.111 --> 00:18:49.910
<v Speaker 2>like makeup.</v>

649
00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:50.743
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

650
00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:51.720
<v Speaker 2>Patrick Mcgee.</v>

651
00:18:51.721 --> 00:18:55.260
<v Speaker 2>He's the guy who made that American Werewolf in London out in the lobby that</v>

652
00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:59.020
<v Speaker 2>that guy was like when I had them on the show he was talking about like,</v>

653
00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:03.960
<v Speaker 2>those days are kind of going and it sucks because when you look at like fake</v>

654
00:19:03.961 --> 00:19:05.070
<v Speaker 2>monsters in movies,</v>

655
00:19:05.071 --> 00:19:06.390
<v Speaker 2>like perfect examples,</v>

656
00:19:06.391 --> 00:19:08.680
<v Speaker 2>like hose underworld hawks,</v>

657
00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:10.650
<v Speaker 2>a good example to the underworld.</v>

658
00:19:10.651 --> 00:19:11.760
<v Speaker 2>Werewolf's yeah,</v>

659
00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:14.280
<v Speaker 2>like they look so vague but kind of cool.</v>

660
00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:14.800
<v Speaker 2>It's cool,</v>

661
00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:16.480
<v Speaker 2>but it's video game.</v>

662
00:19:16.481 --> 00:19:17.640
<v Speaker 2>It's like in a different.</v>

663
00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:18.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

664
00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:19.230
<v Speaker 2>it's cool,</v>

665
00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:23.190
<v Speaker 2>but you don't think you're looking at a real thing like the twilight werewolf</v>

666
00:19:23.191 --> 00:19:25.380
<v Speaker 2>guys when they turn to the wolves and twilight.</v>

667
00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:27.090
<v Speaker 2>You like get the fuck Outta here.</v>

668
00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:28.950
<v Speaker 2>That does not look real.</v>

669
00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:29.550
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

670
00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:30.383
<v Speaker 2>It just doesn't look.</v>

671
00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:32.010
<v Speaker 2>Even if it's bad,</v>

672
00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:34.590
<v Speaker 2>as long as you're looking at a real thing,</v>

673
00:19:34.591 --> 00:19:35.790
<v Speaker 2>it's not as offensive.</v>

674
00:19:35.791 --> 00:19:37.440
<v Speaker 2>Like the creature from the black lagoon.</v>

675
00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:39.270
<v Speaker 2>It's Kinda bad.</v>

676
00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:41.600
<v Speaker 2>But you're looking at a real,</v>

677
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.850
<v Speaker 2>like a lighting thing where you can.</v>

678
00:19:44.851 --> 00:19:46.260
<v Speaker 2>With the CG you can tell it.</v>

679
00:19:46.261 --> 00:19:50.160
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like the shadows and reflections are kind of off a little bit and</v>

680
00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:53.850
<v Speaker 2>even if you're dealing with poor costume or um,</v>

681
00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:56.020
<v Speaker 2>well I mean that thing out there is perfect.</v>

682
00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:57.570
<v Speaker 2>That's better than any CGI.</v>

683
00:19:57.571 --> 00:19:59.610
<v Speaker 2>You're going to possibly bad around it though.</v>

684
00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:03.720
<v Speaker 2>The getting better at it and like the wolves and game of thrones or like the</v>

685
00:20:03.721 --> 00:20:06.070
<v Speaker 2>closest to a real animal and they still,</v>

686
00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:06.840
<v Speaker 2>they still,</v>

687
00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:07.350
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

688
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:08.190
<v Speaker 2>they still suck,</v>

689
00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:12.960
<v Speaker 2>but there's the kind of get a real wolf wolf or they don't listen,</v>

690
00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:16.750
<v Speaker 2>not listen.</v>

691
00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:19.340
<v Speaker 2>It's a great friend who has wolves and they're,</v>

692
00:20:19.341 --> 00:20:23.100
<v Speaker 2>they're cool animals but you are not telling them what to do because it's not</v>

693
00:20:23.101 --> 00:20:23.511
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>

694
00:20:23.511 --> 00:20:27.210
<v Speaker 2>And maybe they'll sit for a second if you give them meat,</v>

695
00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:29.100
<v Speaker 2>but they're on their own little trip.</v>

696
00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:30.053
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>

697
00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:31.530
<v Speaker 2>there's no evidence ever.</v>

698
00:20:31.531 --> 00:20:33.840
<v Speaker 2>If somebody's having trained one will you train them?</v>

699
00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:35.570
<v Speaker 2>But you don't train them like a dog.</v>

700
00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:36.803
<v Speaker 2>Like they're fucking.</v>

701
00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:38.250
<v Speaker 2>Like when I went to his house it was like,</v>

702
00:20:38.251 --> 00:20:38.691
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

703
00:20:38.691 --> 00:20:41.520
<v Speaker 2>these are not dogs like they did looking at you,</v>

704
00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:42.900
<v Speaker 2>they're checking you out.</v>

705
00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:43.411
<v Speaker 2>And when you,</v>

706
00:20:43.411 --> 00:20:44.011
<v Speaker 2>how the,</v>

707
00:20:44.011 --> 00:20:44.844
<v Speaker 2>how with you.</v>

708
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.110
<v Speaker 2>Like I will go into his living room.</v>

709
00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:51.610
<v Speaker 2>They just can't help it.</v>

710
00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:52.391
<v Speaker 2>They can't help it.</v>

711
00:20:52.391 --> 00:20:54.390
<v Speaker 2>They just have to fucking house shits do that.</v>

712
00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:55.370
<v Speaker 2>Shits is.</v>

713
00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:55.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

714
00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:59.320
<v Speaker 2>because they're like wolf reeling from the Wolfe family are hilarious.</v>

715
00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:07.520
<v Speaker 2>Dogs to dogs are more closer to the wolf I guess if that's true or not.</v>

716
00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:17.230
<v Speaker 2>Huskies look like a fucking wolf and they're weird band.</v>

717
00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:18.280
<v Speaker 2>There's a weird animal.</v>

718
00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:19.090
<v Speaker 2>You can't.</v>

719
00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:20.950
<v Speaker 2>They like this guy that had them.</v>

720
00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:22.690
<v Speaker 2>I saw a guy walk into the other day,</v>

721
00:21:22.691 --> 00:21:24.040
<v Speaker 2>some old dude and he had a,</v>

722
00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:27.910
<v Speaker 2>they had those face things on them to protect their josh shot where they call</v>

723
00:21:27.911 --> 00:21:30.980
<v Speaker 2>those things must a muzzle muzzle.</v>

724
00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:33.280
<v Speaker 2>They were muzzled to keep their,</v>

725
00:21:33.281 --> 00:21:33.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

726
00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:35.170
<v Speaker 2>their face from biting people.</v>

727
00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:37.450
<v Speaker 2>What's funny is they have this new thing if we had the internet,</v>

728
00:21:37.451 --> 00:21:38.090
<v Speaker 2>which show you,</v>

729
00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:42.970
<v Speaker 2>they have these new muscles that look like rabid angry werewolf faces.</v>

730
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.640
<v Speaker 2>So like when they put the muzzle on the dog,</v>

731
00:21:45.641 --> 00:21:47.360
<v Speaker 2>that dog looks like it's about to attack you.</v>

732
00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:48.370
<v Speaker 2>That's not a good move.</v>

733
00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:49.293
<v Speaker 2>That's not.</v>

734
00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:53.140
<v Speaker 2>Couldn't move at all because then you have the dog in the park people.</v>

735
00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:54.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

736
00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:57.420
<v Speaker 2>It was just an asshole if you see it,</v>

737
00:21:57.430 --> 00:21:58.400
<v Speaker 2>if you got</v>

738
00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:00.940
<v Speaker 2>dogs hardcore.</v>

739
00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:02.410
<v Speaker 2>That's really funny.</v>

740
00:22:02.411 --> 00:22:03.310
<v Speaker 2>If you said it would be funny,</v>

741
00:22:03.311 --> 00:22:04.360
<v Speaker 2>it was a smiley face.</v>

742
00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:05.973
<v Speaker 2>Smiley.</v>

743
00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:06.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

744
00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:07.743
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

745
00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:08.710
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

746
00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:09.850
<v Speaker 2>this dude who had the wolves,</v>

747
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.340
<v Speaker 2>I always felt it was like super irresponsible to have them.</v>

748
00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:12.941
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

749
00:22:12.941 --> 00:22:15.670
<v Speaker 2>his wolves got out and they killed a bunch of the neighbors sheep.</v>

750
00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:19.190
<v Speaker 2>He lived in Texas to spread in Texas.</v>

751
00:22:19.191 --> 00:22:21.520
<v Speaker 2>Like his family had a ranch and he'd go out to the ranch,</v>

752
00:22:21.521 --> 00:22:22.060
<v Speaker 2>brings dogs,</v>

753
00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:24.490
<v Speaker 2>sometimes dogs in quotes.</v>

754
00:22:24.491 --> 00:22:25.301
<v Speaker 2>There are seven eights,</v>

755
00:22:25.301 --> 00:22:25.661
<v Speaker 2>wolf,</v>

756
00:22:25.661 --> 00:22:29.050
<v Speaker 2>one eighth dog because you can't own 100 percent wolf I guess,</v>

757
00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:29.590
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

758
00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:30.020
<v Speaker 2>and like,</v>

759
00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:31.030
<v Speaker 2>like really,</v>

760
00:22:31.031 --> 00:22:32.230
<v Speaker 2>really high bizarre.</v>

761
00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:34.870
<v Speaker 2>As you get those people with cheetahs on their couch.</v>

762
00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:36.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you could own them as you went to those places.</v>

763
00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:42.280
<v Speaker 2>There's some states like Texas has some crazy laws in Texas as you could fucking</v>

764
00:22:42.431 --> 00:22:42.701
<v Speaker 2>seat.</v>

765
00:22:42.701 --> 00:22:43.840
<v Speaker 2>There's everything in Texas.</v>

766
00:22:43.841 --> 00:22:47.410
<v Speaker 2>They have all these African animals on these high fence hunting operations.</v>

767
00:22:47.411 --> 00:22:49.270
<v Speaker 2>You can go and hunt just like you're in Africa.</v>

768
00:22:49.271 --> 00:22:53.890
<v Speaker 2>You can hunt like oryx and linens and all these giant fucking African Savanna.</v>

769
00:22:53.891 --> 00:22:55.570
<v Speaker 2>Animals landed the free.</v>

770
00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:56.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

771
00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:57.540
<v Speaker 2>They have a bunch of different muscles.</v>

772
00:22:57.541 --> 00:23:00.520
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's a little tiny dog.</v>

773
00:23:00.521 --> 00:23:00.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

774
00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:02.320
<v Speaker 2>It's Kinda cute if it's a plug.</v>

775
00:23:02.321 --> 00:23:03.041
<v Speaker 2>And then there's like,</v>

776
00:23:03.041 --> 00:23:04.330
<v Speaker 2>here's the one I was talking about,</v>

777
00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:05.020
<v Speaker 2>like there's,</v>

778
00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:08.410
<v Speaker 2>they have like crazy looking ones where some are more realistic than you find</v>

779
00:23:08.411 --> 00:23:10.060
<v Speaker 2>out about something like this because there's a little dog.</v>

780
00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:10.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

781
00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:10.691
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

782
00:23:10.691 --> 00:23:10.961
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

783
00:23:10.961 --> 00:23:12.340
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking if you went from,</v>

784
00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:13.780
<v Speaker 2>does your dog bite?</v>

785
00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:14.520
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

786
00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:14.981
<v Speaker 2>If it did,</v>

787
00:23:14.981 --> 00:23:18.010
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't even know what's going on down there.</v>

788
00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:19.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting bit by a dog.</v>

789
00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:20.733
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck?</v>

790
00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:23.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm so anyway.</v>

791
00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:25.810
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how the fuck we got onto the subject of wolves.</v>

792
00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:27.010
<v Speaker 2>I think it was all CGI.</v>

793
00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:27.291
<v Speaker 2>Cgi.</v>

794
00:23:27.291 --> 00:23:27.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

795
00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:29.080
<v Speaker 2>There is that with the,</v>

796
00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:29.920
<v Speaker 2>what do they call it?</v>

797
00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:30.550
<v Speaker 2>The um,</v>

798
00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:31.600
<v Speaker 2>something valley,</v>

799
00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:36.690
<v Speaker 2>the uncanny valley with people like when they show people a Nvidia had a</v>

800
00:23:38.081 --> 00:23:40.470
<v Speaker 2>demonstration and we went to it and uh,</v>

801
00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:44.860
<v Speaker 2>one of the cool things about the demo was you could see what they can't get yet.</v>

802
00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:45.990
<v Speaker 2>They can get high balls,</v>

803
00:23:45.991 --> 00:23:46.791
<v Speaker 2>they can get skin,</v>

804
00:23:46.791 --> 00:23:47.331
<v Speaker 2>they're really good at,</v>

805
00:23:47.331 --> 00:23:48.590
<v Speaker 2>but they can't do eyelashes,</v>

806
00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:49.850
<v Speaker 2>hair and they can't do it.</v>

807
00:23:49.851 --> 00:23:50.061
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

808
00:23:50.061 --> 00:23:50.691
<v Speaker 2>heres bad.</v>

809
00:23:50.691 --> 00:23:53.690
<v Speaker 2>The guy that and the thing was bald and they can't do tongues.</v>

810
00:23:55.550 --> 00:23:56.840
<v Speaker 2>Tongues look fake too.</v>

811
00:23:56.841 --> 00:23:58.070
<v Speaker 2>So while the guy was talking,</v>

812
00:23:58.340 --> 00:23:59.000
<v Speaker 2>there was no,</v>

813
00:23:59.000 --> 00:23:59.810
<v Speaker 2>no tongue,</v>

814
00:23:59.810 --> 00:24:00.800
<v Speaker 2>like you didn't see his tongue.</v>

815
00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:02.630
<v Speaker 2>So fucking weird.</v>

816
00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:03.860
<v Speaker 2>It was like a few things,</v>

817
00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:09.750
<v Speaker 2>a computational thing when you're dealing with something so refined like strands</v>

818
00:24:10.281 --> 00:24:11.390
<v Speaker 2>of hair for example,</v>

819
00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:13.910
<v Speaker 2>in each one behaving independently,</v>

820
00:24:13.911 --> 00:24:14.780
<v Speaker 2>like long here,</v>

821
00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:19.550
<v Speaker 2>thrashing around is like incredibly complex piece moves.</v>

822
00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:24.500
<v Speaker 2>So you would need some incredible hardware to be able to replicate that.</v>

823
00:24:24.501 --> 00:24:25.760
<v Speaker 2>But that said,</v>

824
00:24:25.761 --> 00:24:28.040
<v Speaker 2>it's never stopped the progression in the past.</v>

825
00:24:28.041 --> 00:24:28.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

826
00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:32.540
<v Speaker 2>I got this a retro console the other day that plays Nintendo Games,</v>

827
00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:36.470
<v Speaker 2>so I could be like a hipster and play the original Mario and whatnot.</v>

828
00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:37.933
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

829
00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:42.710
<v Speaker 2>it's just amazing that in my lifetime we've already gone from a little guy who's</v>

830
00:24:42.711 --> 00:24:46.630
<v Speaker 2>like eight pixels total as your character in the game to,</v>

831
00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:48.080
<v Speaker 2>to what we're working with now.</v>

832
00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:52.880
<v Speaker 2>There's some clips on youtube of people who have taken a grand theft auto clips</v>

833
00:24:52.881 --> 00:24:55.850
<v Speaker 2>and applied intense shaders and things to them.</v>

834
00:24:55.910 --> 00:24:56.360
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen?</v>

835
00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:56.781
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

836
00:24:56.781 --> 00:24:58.070
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty amazing what they're doing.</v>

837
00:24:58.720 --> 00:24:59.990
<v Speaker 2>Did that they.</v>

838
00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:01.830
<v Speaker 2>They used a goddammit.</v>

839
00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:03.530
<v Speaker 2>I just glanced at the article real quickly,</v>

840
00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:08.800
<v Speaker 2>but they used like the final scene in the show and imported it into a video</v>

841
00:25:09.081 --> 00:25:09.830
<v Speaker 2>game.</v>

842
00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:10.663
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

843
00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:11.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

844
00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:12.381
<v Speaker 2>God Damn it.</v>

845
00:25:12.381 --> 00:25:12.921
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen that.</v>

846
00:25:12.921 --> 00:25:13.790
<v Speaker 2>It's probably grand theft auto,</v>

847
00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:17.690
<v Speaker 2>grand theft auto maker or whatever that they released is pretty intense.</v>

848
00:25:17.691 --> 00:25:20.870
<v Speaker 2>You can build your own levels and things,</v>

849
00:25:20.871 --> 00:25:22.100
<v Speaker 2>movies and stuff,</v>

850
00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:23.800
<v Speaker 2>so maybe that's what it may be.</v>

851
00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:27.230
<v Speaker 2>Mods and you're talking about how that some the modern one.</v>

852
00:25:27.231 --> 00:25:27.471
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

853
00:25:27.471 --> 00:25:31.420
<v Speaker 2>where they've taken like Pixar textures and just took it to the next level so</v>

854
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:32.221
<v Speaker 2>you're looking at it.</v>

855
00:25:32.221 --> 00:25:34.970
<v Speaker 2>It's a very slow frame rate because again,</v>

856
00:25:34.971 --> 00:25:38.240
<v Speaker 2>coming back to resource intensive tasks,</v>

857
00:25:38.241 --> 00:25:43.241
<v Speaker 2>but you can get a sense for what that will be like and so like bringing it full</v>

858
00:25:44.301 --> 00:25:46.280
<v Speaker 2>circle back to back to this thing here.</v>

859
00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:49.820
<v Speaker 2>I think that the more accessible this stuff becomes so the.</v>

860
00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:54.880
<v Speaker 2>The cheaper that vr gets and the less that it's tied down to anything,</v>

861
00:25:55.161 --> 00:25:56.750
<v Speaker 2>the smaller that it gets,</v>

862
00:25:57.290 --> 00:26:00.830
<v Speaker 2>the greater the likelihood that there'll be a enough demand that people will</v>

863
00:26:00.831 --> 00:26:02.810
<v Speaker 2>then go and produce cool content for it.</v>

864
00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:04.040
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

865
00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:04.821
<v Speaker 2>which phone is that?</v>

866
00:26:04.821 --> 00:26:05.720
<v Speaker 2>That's the Esx,</v>

867
00:26:05.721 --> 00:26:07.600
<v Speaker 2>this Samsung the six.</v>

868
00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:11.990
<v Speaker 2>You can also get this headset for the note for right now.</v>

869
00:26:12.650 --> 00:26:13.580
<v Speaker 2>For some reason,</v>

870
00:26:13.581 --> 00:26:14.420
<v Speaker 2>those two.</v>

871
00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:16.970
<v Speaker 2>This is the newest one that they make.</v>

872
00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:22.000
<v Speaker 2>There are also a generic branded ones that you can slip any phone into.</v>

873
00:26:22.191 --> 00:26:25.850
<v Speaker 2>The only issue that arises from that is how do you,</v>

874
00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:27.020
<v Speaker 2>how to interact with it.</v>

875
00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:29.030
<v Speaker 2>Like you have these weird switches or buttons.</v>

876
00:26:29.031 --> 00:26:31.190
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you don't have a nice touch pad like this one.</v>

877
00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:33.740
<v Speaker 2>So that's the only thing to consider.</v>

878
00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:35.700
<v Speaker 2>An htc also make one that's pretty,</v>

879
00:26:35.701 --> 00:26:36.410
<v Speaker 2>like the vive.</v>

880
00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:36.711
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

881
00:26:36.711 --> 00:26:37.100
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

882
00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:38.720
<v Speaker 2>that's a standalone headset.</v>

883
00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:41.600
<v Speaker 2>Yet people are saying great things about that.</v>

884
00:26:41.601 --> 00:26:42.560
<v Speaker 2>I haven't tried it yet.</v>

885
00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:43.290
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

886
00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:46.200
<v Speaker 2>but every manufacturer is apparently interested in it.</v>

887
00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:49.500
<v Speaker 2>And I've been noticing more and more uploads on Youtube.</v>

888
00:26:49.501 --> 00:26:53.640
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing how Youtube has pushed not not just this,</v>

889
00:26:53.641 --> 00:26:57.270
<v Speaker 2>but like also four k I upload my videos and in four k for example,</v>

890
00:26:57.271 --> 00:26:58.050
<v Speaker 2>they are there for you.</v>

891
00:26:58.050 --> 00:27:03.050
<v Speaker 2>You have these giant productions for television shows and you can't get that</v>

892
00:27:03.391 --> 00:27:04.400
<v Speaker 2>content in four k.</v>

893
00:27:04.401 --> 00:27:05.250
<v Speaker 2>it's bizarre.</v>

894
00:27:05.251 --> 00:27:06.890
<v Speaker 2>It's like they spent $100,</v>

895
00:27:06.891 --> 00:27:07.651
<v Speaker 2>million dollars.</v>

896
00:27:07.651 --> 00:27:07.980
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

897
00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:09.090
<v Speaker 2>in the case of house of cards,</v>

898
00:27:09.091 --> 00:27:10.080
<v Speaker 2>you could get it in full Rez,</v>

899
00:27:10.081 --> 00:27:10.770
<v Speaker 2>but anyway,</v>

900
00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:12.210
<v Speaker 2>you've been able to do that on youtube for a while.</v>

901
00:27:12.211 --> 00:27:14.010
<v Speaker 2>Now you're getting three 60 video on youtube.</v>

902
00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:15.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you've checked any of it out.</v>

903
00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:16.770
<v Speaker 2>I haven't checked that out,</v>

904
00:27:16.771 --> 00:27:19.260
<v Speaker 2>but the Fort K's interesting because like the new apple box,</v>

905
00:27:19.261 --> 00:27:21.990
<v Speaker 2>they're saying the new apple TV that was announced last week,</v>

906
00:27:22.090 --> 00:27:23.400
<v Speaker 2>supposedly it doesn't run fourK ,</v>

907
00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:28.020
<v Speaker 2>which I thought was interesting because is it just that they're not pushing the</v>

908
00:27:28.021 --> 00:27:30.720
<v Speaker 2>four k to the masses yet?</v>

909
00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:31.790
<v Speaker 2>Because I,</v>

910
00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:32.881
<v Speaker 2>I honestly,</v>

911
00:27:32.881 --> 00:27:34.920
<v Speaker 2>I think it comes is a bandwidth issue.</v>

912
00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:35.600
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>

913
00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:36.900
<v Speaker 2>a connection issue.</v>

914
00:27:36.901 --> 00:27:41.901
<v Speaker 2>Everybody is sort of held up by the terrible telcos situation that exists here.</v>

915
00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:43.530
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

916
00:27:43.530 --> 00:27:47.400
<v Speaker 2>I did some research recently on like Internet connections around the world and</v>

917
00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:48.690
<v Speaker 2>like North America,</v>

918
00:27:48.691 --> 00:27:50.010
<v Speaker 2>he's insanely bad.</v>

919
00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:51.800
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

920
00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:52.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

921
00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:53.091
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

922
00:27:53.091 --> 00:27:53.370
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

923
00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:56.260
<v Speaker 2>it's quite surprising comparatively like country Korea,</v>

924
00:27:56.261 --> 00:27:56.970
<v Speaker 2>Korea's insane,</v>

925
00:27:56.970 --> 00:27:57.241
<v Speaker 2>south.</v>

926
00:27:57.241 --> 00:27:57.470
<v Speaker 2>Crazy,</v>

927
00:27:57.470 --> 00:27:57.751
<v Speaker 2>insane.</v>

928
00:27:57.751 --> 00:28:02.751
<v Speaker 2>But even countries you wouldn't expect like Romania or Latvia,</v>

929
00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:07.620
<v Speaker 2>like some of these countries that I sort of often converse with my audience</v>

930
00:28:07.621 --> 00:28:09.090
<v Speaker 2>members and they're sending me,</v>

931
00:28:09.091 --> 00:28:12.450
<v Speaker 2>they send me their speed tests and then tell me what they're paying for it.</v>

932
00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:14.190
<v Speaker 2>And you get,</v>

933
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:16.950
<v Speaker 2>and I'm sure there's plenty of people listening here that are going to start</v>

934
00:28:16.951 --> 00:28:18.030
<v Speaker 2>tweeting out their speeds.</v>

935
00:28:18.031 --> 00:28:20.250
<v Speaker 2>Let us know how fast your Internet is and what you pay for it.</v>

936
00:28:20.251 --> 00:28:21.540
<v Speaker 2>But in Korea for example,</v>

937
00:28:21.541 --> 00:28:25.170
<v Speaker 2>I think like $10 gets you a 100 by 100 up and down.</v>

938
00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:25.771
<v Speaker 2>And why is it,</v>

939
00:28:25.771 --> 00:28:28.200
<v Speaker 2>why is it up so restricted?</v>

940
00:28:28.201 --> 00:28:32.070
<v Speaker 2>In the United States we have like I have three and that's the fastest you can</v>

941
00:28:32.071 --> 00:28:32.641
<v Speaker 2>read up.</v>

942
00:28:32.641 --> 00:28:35.100
<v Speaker 2>Three up I think has been the fastest that I can get.</v>

943
00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:36.510
<v Speaker 2>T and t uverse,</v>

944
00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:37.650
<v Speaker 2>it's something to do,</v>

945
00:28:37.651 --> 00:28:38.850
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not an expert on this,</v>

946
00:28:38.851 --> 00:28:39.141
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

947
00:28:39.141 --> 00:28:44.141
<v Speaker 2>it's something to do with the cable and Dsl structure that,</v>

948
00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:45.000
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

949
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.230
<v Speaker 2>there's some sort of signal loss I think associated with that where for some</v>

950
00:28:49.231 --> 00:28:50.640
<v Speaker 2>reason the upload is more,</v>

951
00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:52.290
<v Speaker 2>is more labor intensive,</v>

952
00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:55.680
<v Speaker 2>but when you're talking about a fiber is always one by one,</v>

953
00:28:55.890 --> 00:28:56.280
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

954
00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:57.001
<v Speaker 2>If it's not,</v>

955
00:28:57.001 --> 00:29:02.001
<v Speaker 2>then usually it's not real fiber and in places small places with smaller</v>

956
00:29:02.071 --> 00:29:03.180
<v Speaker 2>geographic areas,</v>

957
00:29:03.181 --> 00:29:08.181
<v Speaker 2>it's easier to run fiber fiber from the CEO point right to the actual customers</v>

958
00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:10.950
<v Speaker 2>because of the dense,</v>

959
00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:14.400
<v Speaker 2>the density of people makes it worthwhile to do so.</v>

960
00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:17.580
<v Speaker 2>And North America for the most part is still pretty spread out,</v>

961
00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:22.610
<v Speaker 2>but google fiber is emerging in more and more cities and it's completely</v>

962
00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:28.150
<v Speaker 2>overhaul and going over the top on the incumbent sort of providers,</v>

963
00:29:28.170 --> 00:29:30.260
<v Speaker 2>comcast at and t,</v>

964
00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:31.373
<v Speaker 2>whoever.</v>

965
00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:33.750
<v Speaker 2>And the scary thing was they were trying to merge recently.</v>

966
00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:34.770
<v Speaker 2>Who Was it?</v>

967
00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:35.603
<v Speaker 2>Was it.</v>

968
00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:37.920
<v Speaker 2>They did merge a DIRECTV.</v>

969
00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:38.551
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

970
00:29:38.551 --> 00:29:38.980
<v Speaker 2>did they?</v>

971
00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:39.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

972
00:29:39.450 --> 00:29:40.320
<v Speaker 2>Maybe there's another one,</v>

973
00:29:40.321 --> 00:29:41.154
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think that's.</v>

974
00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:41.801
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

975
00:29:41.801 --> 00:29:43.450
<v Speaker 2>it was time Warner and something else.</v>

976
00:29:43.451 --> 00:29:43.720
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

977
00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:45.340
<v Speaker 2>I think it was time Warner and comcast.</v>

978
00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:45.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

979
00:29:45.890 --> 00:29:48.610
<v Speaker 2>we're attempting to merge and then the FCC or whoever,</v>

980
00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:50.200
<v Speaker 2>whatever party was got involved.</v>

981
00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:54.070
<v Speaker 2>Well when they find out they're throttling data and fucking with people that use</v>

982
00:29:54.071 --> 00:29:57.520
<v Speaker 2>Netflix and then they made a deal that they had to make a deal with Netflix and</v>

983
00:29:57.521 --> 00:30:01.210
<v Speaker 2>that they could get more data because Netflix was.</v>

984
00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:01.580
<v Speaker 2>There were,</v>

985
00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:06.010
<v Speaker 2>there were consistently slower when people using Netflix and anything else they</v>

986
00:30:06.011 --> 00:30:06.790
<v Speaker 2>fuck with people.</v>

987
00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:08.620
<v Speaker 2>Oh they hate netflix.</v>

988
00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:09.580
<v Speaker 2>They hate the Internet.</v>

989
00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:09.920
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

990
00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:14.920
<v Speaker 2>traditional media is always taking shots wherever they can to to sort of slow</v>

991
00:30:15.491 --> 00:30:18.700
<v Speaker 2>down this thing that's happening online because they don't control enough of it.</v>

992
00:30:18.790 --> 00:30:21.760
<v Speaker 2>But isn't it also because the infrastructure is just not really that good yet.</v>

993
00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:23.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean they didn't really prepare for the,</v>

994
00:30:23.770 --> 00:30:26.830
<v Speaker 2>the jumps in the internet usage over the last date,</v>

995
00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:27.551
<v Speaker 2>decade or so.</v>

996
00:30:27.551 --> 00:30:27.910
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

997
00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:28.481
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>

998
00:30:28.481 --> 00:30:28.900
<v Speaker 2>But there,</v>

999
00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:29.350
<v Speaker 2>there are.</v>

1000
00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:34.350
<v Speaker 2>There are things they could have done to sort of limit the effect of that.</v>

1001
00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:36.790
<v Speaker 2>Like a wireless for example,</v>

1002
00:30:36.791 --> 00:30:38.500
<v Speaker 2>like if you're on Lte,</v>

1003
00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:40.690
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden you've got 20 megabits up.</v>

1004
00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:43.930
<v Speaker 2>Like how is it that the wireless connections on your,</v>

1005
00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:45.311
<v Speaker 2>for a lot of people,</v>

1006
00:30:45.311 --> 00:30:49.060
<v Speaker 2>their cell phone data connection is faster than what they have at home.</v>

1007
00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:49.680
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1008
00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:50.290
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1009
00:30:50.290 --> 00:30:52.390
<v Speaker 2>But it costs you a lot of money because it's not,</v>

1010
00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:53.560
<v Speaker 2>it's not unlimited.</v>

1011
00:30:53.890 --> 00:30:58.890
<v Speaker 2>So like you could imagine that if you had put up more towers or limb or or</v>

1012
00:31:00.401 --> 00:31:02.810
<v Speaker 2>taking down the cost of wireless data for example,</v>

1013
00:31:02.811 --> 00:31:05.590
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of countries have had to skip over the.</v>

1014
00:31:05.591 --> 00:31:08.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm wired connections completely.</v>

1015
00:31:08.290 --> 00:31:09.880
<v Speaker 2>So if you're in India for example,</v>

1016
00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:15.030
<v Speaker 2>they completely skipped like laptops and that whole period of time there were.</v>

1017
00:31:15.370 --> 00:31:18.970
<v Speaker 2>Everybody was buying a cable connection or a DSL connection.</v>

1018
00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:23.470
<v Speaker 2>They're getting cell phones now and their primary data connection is going to be</v>

1019
00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:24.990
<v Speaker 2>on that mobile device and it's,</v>

1020
00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:27.730
<v Speaker 2>it's the same and a lot of emerging markets around the world.</v>

1021
00:31:27.731 --> 00:31:32.731
<v Speaker 2>So they're like investing specifically in wireless as opposed to like going</v>

1022
00:31:32.861 --> 00:31:36.400
<v Speaker 2>backwards and trying to make the wired thing work at all.</v>

1023
00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:38.410
<v Speaker 2>So that's.</v>

1024
00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:41.980
<v Speaker 2>So did they have like data caps on wireless?</v>

1025
00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:42.521
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1026
00:31:42.521 --> 00:31:43.840
<v Speaker 2>it's incredibly expensive.</v>

1027
00:31:43.930 --> 00:31:44.201
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1028
00:31:44.201 --> 00:31:45.034
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

1029
00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:45.910
<v Speaker 2>They have a,</v>

1030
00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:49.300
<v Speaker 2>they have data caps and they also limit things like text messages.</v>

1031
00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:54.300
<v Speaker 2>This is why a instant messaging apps like whatsapp are so popular elsewhere in</v>

1032
00:31:54.701 --> 00:31:55.091
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

1033
00:31:55.091 --> 00:31:56.650
<v Speaker 2>People trying to scoot around,</v>

1034
00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:57.491
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1035
00:31:57.491 --> 00:31:58.450
<v Speaker 2>the Telcos,</v>

1036
00:31:58.640 --> 00:31:59.800
<v Speaker 2>it's not expensive.</v>

1037
00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:00.251
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't,</v>

1038
00:32:00.251 --> 00:32:02.800
<v Speaker 2>it's expensive relative to what people earn their.</v>

1039
00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:04.160
<v Speaker 2>So what's APP,</v>

1040
00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:05.030
<v Speaker 2>what does that do?</v>

1041
00:32:05.030 --> 00:32:05.221
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

1042
00:32:05.221 --> 00:32:10.221
<v Speaker 2>it lets you use the data on your phone instead of using like text message</v>

1043
00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:11.920
<v Speaker 2>minutes and.</v>

1044
00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:12.461
<v Speaker 2>Exactly,</v>

1045
00:32:12.461 --> 00:32:12.671
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1046
00:32:12.671 --> 00:32:17.440
<v Speaker 2>It lets you avoid whatever the Telcos gonna impose for the cost of a text</v>

1047
00:32:17.441 --> 00:32:17.591
<v Speaker 2>message.</v>

1048
00:32:17.591 --> 00:32:20.170
<v Speaker 2>Like a text message is incredibly small amount of data,</v>

1049
00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:25.710
<v Speaker 2>yet you could be traveling and your Telco could charge you twenty five cents for</v>

1050
00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:27.490
<v Speaker 2>each one.</v>

1051
00:32:27.490 --> 00:32:27.701
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1052
00:32:27.701 --> 00:32:28.660
<v Speaker 2>unless you're on t mobile,</v>

1053
00:32:29.410 --> 00:32:30.820
<v Speaker 2>t mobile and it,</v>

1054
00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:31.041
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1055
00:32:31.041 --> 00:32:31.661
<v Speaker 2>it's really bizarre.</v>

1056
00:32:31.661 --> 00:32:32.291
<v Speaker 2>Even me.</v>

1057
00:32:32.291 --> 00:32:32.561
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1058
00:32:32.561 --> 00:32:34.690
<v Speaker 2>So I'm from Toronto and uh,</v>

1059
00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:35.340
<v Speaker 2>and I'm on,</v>

1060
00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:38.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm on Roger's not a huge fan or anything,</v>

1061
00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:40.760
<v Speaker 2>but I'm saying comparatively speaking,</v>

1062
00:32:40.761 --> 00:32:42.230
<v Speaker 2>like when I traveled down here,</v>

1063
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:47.470
<v Speaker 2>the maximum that I can pay over top of my regular bill is $5 a day,</v>

1064
00:32:47.811 --> 00:32:50.720
<v Speaker 2>maximum data calls,</v>

1065
00:32:50.721 --> 00:32:51.210
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1066
00:32:51.210 --> 00:32:51.620
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1067
00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:52.280
<v Speaker 2>that's where it,</v>

1068
00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:53.111
<v Speaker 2>it's capped out at.</v>

1069
00:32:53.111 --> 00:32:54.650
<v Speaker 2>So you're basically using your regular,</v>

1070
00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:55.730
<v Speaker 2>your regular plan,</v>

1071
00:32:55.731 --> 00:32:59.720
<v Speaker 2>even though you're on 18 t or t mobile or whoever it is out here now.</v>

1072
00:32:59.721 --> 00:33:00.010
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1073
00:33:00.010 --> 00:33:01.460
<v Speaker 2>that's relatively recent,</v>

1074
00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:06.520
<v Speaker 2>but t mobile came out with something that allows for you to cross the Canadian</v>

1075
00:33:07.371 --> 00:33:12.010
<v Speaker 2>border and the Mexican border and essentially have your exact same plan almost</v>

1076
00:33:12.370 --> 00:33:13.071
<v Speaker 2>in most countries.</v>

1077
00:33:13.071 --> 00:33:15.590
<v Speaker 2>And most of my friends just got back from Vietnam,</v>

1078
00:33:15.591 --> 00:33:17.540
<v Speaker 2>I think it was or or something like that.</v>

1079
00:33:17.541 --> 00:33:19.070
<v Speaker 2>And he said there was no difference.</v>

1080
00:33:19.071 --> 00:33:19.401
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1081
00:33:19.401 --> 00:33:20.930
<v Speaker 2>my phone worked like it was back home.</v>

1082
00:33:20.931 --> 00:33:22.280
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get charged a penny more.</v>

1083
00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:23.660
<v Speaker 2>You have to do data roaming.</v>

1084
00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:24.680
<v Speaker 2>Do you have to do roaming?</v>

1085
00:33:24.681 --> 00:33:25.730
<v Speaker 2>Do you have to turn on your technic?</v>

1086
00:33:25.731 --> 00:33:26.960
<v Speaker 2>Technically you are roaming.</v>

1087
00:33:26.961 --> 00:33:27.261
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1088
00:33:27.261 --> 00:33:27.511
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1089
00:33:27.511 --> 00:33:29.520
<v Speaker 2>but do you have to call them and let them know?</v>

1090
00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:29.841
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1091
00:33:29.841 --> 00:33:30.161
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1092
00:33:30.161 --> 00:33:30.311
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1093
00:33:30.311 --> 00:33:30.430
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1094
00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:32.600
<v Speaker 2>That has always been annoying about verizon.</v>

1095
00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:34.240
<v Speaker 2>T mobile is the way to go in.</v>

1096
00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:36.140
<v Speaker 2>I did a speed test last night,</v>

1097
00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:41.430
<v Speaker 2>a 61 down 23 up from my house where my house,</v>

1098
00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:42.680
<v Speaker 2>the Max is unbelievable.</v>

1099
00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:43.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1100
00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:46.490
<v Speaker 2>Mobile faster than my max is three.</v>

1101
00:33:46.550 --> 00:33:47.383
<v Speaker 2>Three on my home.</v>

1102
00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:48.590
<v Speaker 2>I got three or four.</v>

1103
00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:52.310
<v Speaker 2>It's a DSL or cable a and t uverse,</v>

1104
00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:53.303
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1105
00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:56.720
<v Speaker 2>I guess fiber supposed to be really good if the fiber.</v>

1106
00:33:56.890 --> 00:33:57.530
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>

1107
00:33:57.530 --> 00:33:59.000
<v Speaker 2>What's the wire that's coming in?</v>

1108
00:33:59.090 --> 00:33:59.901
<v Speaker 2>What are you plugging in?</v>

1109
00:33:59.901 --> 00:34:01.640
<v Speaker 2>Is it a phone line or a cable connection?</v>

1110
00:34:01.641 --> 00:34:02.370
<v Speaker 2>Cable connection.</v>

1111
00:34:02.370 --> 00:34:02.960
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1112
00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:03.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1113
00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:04.340
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know.</v>

1114
00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:05.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean I thought it was fire.</v>

1115
00:34:05.671 --> 00:34:08.840
<v Speaker 2>I get like supposedly 50 down and you know,</v>

1116
00:34:08.870 --> 00:34:11.750
<v Speaker 2>for us there's no,</v>

1117
00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:16.670
<v Speaker 2>there's tons of marketing confusion around the word fiber because it started to</v>

1118
00:34:16.671 --> 00:34:17.240
<v Speaker 2>get,</v>

1119
00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:19.460
<v Speaker 2>like kind of become a hot term.</v>

1120
00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:21.050
<v Speaker 2>So everyone wanted to use it.</v>

1121
00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:22.340
<v Speaker 2>They wanted in their diet.</v>

1122
00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:24.853
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

1123
00:34:25.130 --> 00:34:25.963
<v Speaker 2>That was too easy.</v>

1124
00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:27.771
<v Speaker 2>But yeah.</v>

1125
00:34:27.771 --> 00:34:28.101
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1126
00:34:28.101 --> 00:34:28.340
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1127
00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:31.520
<v Speaker 2>so everyone started throwing it around even though it's not the real deal,</v>

1128
00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:32.750
<v Speaker 2>it's not real fiber.</v>

1129
00:34:32.751 --> 00:34:35.780
<v Speaker 2>It's like it'll be fiber for this portion of the trip.</v>

1130
00:34:35.781 --> 00:34:36.140
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1131
00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:40.520
<v Speaker 2>And then it'll go to copper somewhere in there and you have signal loss and you</v>

1132
00:34:40.521 --> 00:34:43.130
<v Speaker 2>end up with what you end up with right now.</v>

1133
00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:44.930
<v Speaker 2>What is the difference between what Google is trying to do?</v>

1134
00:34:45.470 --> 00:34:48.530
<v Speaker 2>Google gives zero fucks about,</v>

1135
00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:49.970
<v Speaker 2>about any of these players.</v>

1136
00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:53.000
<v Speaker 2>They know they're not trying to even coordinate with them.</v>

1137
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:57.470
<v Speaker 2>They're going into marketplace is going to the the locals at least this is how</v>

1138
00:34:57.471 --> 00:35:02.030
<v Speaker 2>fiber worked in the early stages and saying would you be interested personally</v>

1139
00:35:02.450 --> 00:35:06.080
<v Speaker 2>in an insanely fast Internet connection and here's the price we could give it to</v>

1140
00:35:06.081 --> 00:35:06.680
<v Speaker 2>you for.</v>

1141
00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:09.290
<v Speaker 2>And so people within a community would sign a petition saying,</v>

1142
00:35:09.291 --> 00:35:09.531
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

1143
00:35:09.531 --> 00:35:10.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm interested in that.</v>

1144
00:35:10.970 --> 00:35:13.760
<v Speaker 2>And once they could evaluate the demand,</v>

1145
00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:15.860
<v Speaker 2>they're building the infrastructure themselves.</v>

1146
00:35:15.890 --> 00:35:16.640
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

1147
00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:17.840
<v Speaker 2>They have that kind of cash.</v>

1148
00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:20.300
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes they do.</v>

1149
00:35:20.330 --> 00:35:21.163
<v Speaker 2>They're skynet.</v>

1150
00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:24.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean think about the different shit they have now.</v>

1151
00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:25.880
<v Speaker 2>Oh my goodness.</v>

1152
00:35:25.881 --> 00:35:26.660
<v Speaker 2>So weird.</v>

1153
00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:27.021
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1154
00:35:27.021 --> 00:35:29.030
<v Speaker 2>and it drives me how many people have their,</v>

1155
00:35:29.031 --> 00:35:31.490
<v Speaker 2>their info up on the cloud with Google.</v>

1156
00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:33.530
<v Speaker 2>Everything is there and how come that hasn't been hacked yet?</v>

1157
00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:35.783
<v Speaker 2>Great question.</v>

1158
00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:36.651
<v Speaker 2>Totally has.</v>

1159
00:35:36.651 --> 00:35:38.880
<v Speaker 2>Well I not yet.</v>

1160
00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:39.700
<v Speaker 2>Not yet.</v>

1161
00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:40.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1162
00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:42.660
<v Speaker 2>Not In any big sort of immediate way.</v>

1163
00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:43.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>

1164
00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:44.371
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

1165
00:35:44.371 --> 00:35:44.940
<v Speaker 2>if I had,</v>

1166
00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:48.450
<v Speaker 2>if you had to put your trust in somebody on the web right now,</v>

1167
00:35:48.451 --> 00:35:48.950
<v Speaker 2>like there,</v>

1168
00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:53.950
<v Speaker 2>there aren't too many parties that have been at it for this long and and sort of</v>

1169
00:35:54.570 --> 00:35:59.570
<v Speaker 2>had a history of success the way that Google has even apple sort of scrambling</v>

1170
00:35:59.881 --> 00:36:03.630
<v Speaker 2>to have web services way later than than than Google did.</v>

1171
00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:04.463
<v Speaker 2>I mean g mail,</v>

1172
00:36:04.770 --> 00:36:05.910
<v Speaker 2>people don't even think about it.</v>

1173
00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:07.650
<v Speaker 2>You don't even think about your email.</v>

1174
00:36:07.651 --> 00:36:08.190
<v Speaker 2>You're just like,</v>

1175
00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:08.401
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1176
00:36:08.401 --> 00:36:08.911
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean?</v>

1177
00:36:08.911 --> 00:36:09.870
<v Speaker 2>Of course it's on GMA,</v>

1178
00:36:09.890 --> 00:36:10.021
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1179
00:36:10.021 --> 00:36:10.201
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1180
00:36:10.201 --> 00:36:11.034
<v Speaker 2>it's easy.</v>

1181
00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:12.390
<v Speaker 2>The vast majority of people use it,</v>

1182
00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:13.880
<v Speaker 2>but before g mail it was like,</v>

1183
00:36:13.890 --> 00:36:16.140
<v Speaker 2>it was a confusing setup for email.</v>

1184
00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:19.590
<v Speaker 2>People used to have those little needs to have things down.</v>

1185
00:36:19.591 --> 00:36:20.424
<v Speaker 2>Like outlook.</v>

1186
00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:20.920
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1187
00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:22.110
<v Speaker 2>Your email from outlet,</v>

1188
00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:27.910
<v Speaker 2>you've got mail and you'd have to configure it every time to pop settings and</v>

1189
00:36:27.931 --> 00:36:28.410
<v Speaker 2>whatnot.</v>

1190
00:36:28.410 --> 00:36:28.700
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

1191
00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:29.533
<v Speaker 2>I remember that</v>

1192
00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:32.940
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to put in the server.</v>

1193
00:36:32.941 --> 00:36:33.774
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1194
00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:34.651
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

1195
00:36:34.651 --> 00:36:35.520
<v Speaker 2>I forgot about all that.</v>

1196
00:36:35.521 --> 00:36:35.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1197
00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:36.031
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>

1198
00:36:36.031 --> 00:36:37.020
<v Speaker 2>It was not cool.</v>

1199
00:36:37.021 --> 00:36:38.640
<v Speaker 2>So I think,</v>

1200
00:36:38.641 --> 00:36:40.560
<v Speaker 2>and we may have talked about this before,</v>

1201
00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:42.240
<v Speaker 2>I think their model,</v>

1202
00:36:42.241 --> 00:36:46.920
<v Speaker 2>the sort of ad subsidy model has driven these amazing innovations online.</v>

1203
00:36:47.490 --> 00:36:47.790
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1204
00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:48.520
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

1205
00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:48.750
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1206
00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:53.750
<v Speaker 2>we were talking earlier when I got here about how ad blocking is like the next</v>

1207
00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:56.370
<v Speaker 2>big conversation for the web.</v>

1208
00:36:57.150 --> 00:37:00.060
<v Speaker 2>It's a big conversation with people that are youtube subscribers,</v>

1209
00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:05.090
<v Speaker 2>huge because youtube obviously guys like you guys like me in this show put you</v>

1210
00:37:05.461 --> 00:37:07.860
<v Speaker 2>put ads in the beginning and get revenue from those ads.</v>

1211
00:37:07.861 --> 00:37:08.280
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

1212
00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:09.510
<v Speaker 2>If you put up an ad blocker,</v>

1213
00:37:09.511 --> 00:37:13.470
<v Speaker 2>those ads don't show up and then people don't get those clicks and so they don't</v>

1214
00:37:13.471 --> 00:37:14.400
<v Speaker 2>get as much revenue.</v>

1215
00:37:14.401 --> 00:37:15.660
<v Speaker 2>And so folks,</v>

1216
00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:18.240
<v Speaker 2>like conscientious people will tell you,</v>

1217
00:37:18.241 --> 00:37:18.571
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1218
00:37:18.571 --> 00:37:21.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm turning off my ad blocker to watch your show.</v>

1219
00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:22.850
<v Speaker 2>And it's right just to make sure that you get,</v>

1220
00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:24.120
<v Speaker 2>get your proper pay off.</v>

1221
00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:24.660
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

1222
00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:24.901
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1223
00:37:24.901 --> 00:37:26.820
<v Speaker 2>So listen up audience,</v>

1224
00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:28.230
<v Speaker 2>turn it off.</v>

1225
00:37:28.610 --> 00:37:28.950
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1226
00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:30.600
<v Speaker 2>Turn it back on when you're done with us.</v>

1227
00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:31.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1228
00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:32.000
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

1229
00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.820
<v Speaker 2>it's a significant amount of money and that's what's fascinating now.</v>

1230
00:37:35.970 --> 00:37:36.151
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1231
00:37:36.151 --> 00:37:38.670
<v Speaker 2>obviously you guys get a shitload of downloads.</v>

1232
00:37:38.671 --> 00:37:42.390
<v Speaker 2>You could speak on this even better than we could because for us,</v>

1233
00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:46.920
<v Speaker 2>the 90 percent of the people that get this show get an audio form only.</v>

1234
00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:50.010
<v Speaker 2>Youtube is a fraction.</v>

1235
00:37:50.011 --> 00:37:51.000
<v Speaker 2>There's Vimeo,</v>

1236
00:37:51.210 --> 00:37:55.650
<v Speaker 2>there's ustream and there's youtube and you know those are those all together</v>

1237
00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:57.120
<v Speaker 2>constitute about 10 percent,</v>

1238
00:37:57.710 --> 00:38:02.430
<v Speaker 2>but your whole thing is on like when you do an iphone video of like the big one</v>

1239
00:38:02.431 --> 00:38:06.870

1240
00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:11.310
<v Speaker 2>Like that was fucking millions and millions of hits,</v>

1241
00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:12.263
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:13.980
<v Speaker 2>Billion.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Bag of tricks.</v>

1257
00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:37.810
<v Speaker 2>A little fucking video will come up with this fucking thing.</v>

1258
00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:39.670
<v Speaker 2>The new iphone has a new material,</v>

1259
00:38:39.671 --> 00:38:39.881
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1260
00:38:39.881 --> 00:38:41.290
<v Speaker 2>That's not as bendable.</v>

1261
00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:42.620
<v Speaker 2>Have you been watching on bucks therapies?</v>

1262

1263
00:38:44.650 --> 00:38:45.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:49.360
<v Speaker 2>I guess I get to play with the new iphone the other day and this guy that works</v>

1267
00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:52.640
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1268
00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:54.460
<v Speaker 2>I would like to know what you think about it.</v>

1269
00:38:54.461 --> 00:38:55.630
<v Speaker 2>I think it's like the first iphone.</v>

1270
00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:56.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to buy.</v>

1271
00:38:56.740 --> 00:39:00.460
<v Speaker 2>I think half the shit they showed were just software updates that this iphone</v>

1272
00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:01.270
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>

1273
00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:02.980
<v Speaker 2>normal six could do easily.</v>

1274
00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:03.710
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>

1275
00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:04.880

1277
00:39:07.690 --> 00:39:08.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't want that.</v>

1278
00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:08.950
<v Speaker 2>You can just push.</v>

1279
00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:09.430
<v Speaker 2>You could,</v>

1280
00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:13.330
<v Speaker 2>you could program your phone if you hold down something for two seconds.</v>

1281
00:39:13.331 --> 00:39:14.620
<v Speaker 2>A second menu will pop up.</v>

1282
00:39:14.621 --> 00:39:16.000
<v Speaker 2>Why is this like a big deal?</v>

1283
00:39:16.530 --> 00:39:17.351
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1286
00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:19.780
<v Speaker 2>The new one?</v>

1287
00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:23.410
<v Speaker 2>The new one is [inaudible] touch meaning like you push the screen like that old</v>

1288
00:39:23.411 --> 00:39:26.100
<v Speaker 2>blackberry that you used to have with the blackberry touch.</v>

1289
00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:27.070
<v Speaker 2>That was a piece of shit,</v>

1290
00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:28.000
<v Speaker 2>piece of shit.</v>

00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:30.530
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1296
00:39:33.850 --> 00:39:34.661

1297
00:39:34.661 --> 00:39:34.900
<v Speaker 2>click,</v>

1298
00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:35.141
<v Speaker 2>click,</v>

1299
00:39:35.141 --> 00:39:35.350
<v Speaker 2>click,</v>

1300
00:39:35.350 --> 00:39:35.591
<v Speaker 2>click,</v>

1301
00:39:35.591 --> 00:39:35.810
<v Speaker 2>click.</v>

1302
00:39:35.810 --> 00:39:37.010
<v Speaker 2>When you make a text message,</v>

1303
00:39:37.250 --> 00:39:38.260
<v Speaker 2>push this thunder.</v>

1304
00:39:38.290 --> 00:39:41.300
<v Speaker 2>Thunder vendor is not like that shit.</v>

1305
00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:42.370
<v Speaker 2>Storm Storm.</v>

1306
00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:43.233
<v Speaker 2>That's what it was.</v>

1307
00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:46.120
<v Speaker 2>I hated that fucking phone.</v>

1308
00:39:48.010 --> 00:39:49.590
<v Speaker 2>There's a storm brewing,</v>

1309
00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:53.420
<v Speaker 2>but one of the biggest things was like now you don't have.</v>

1310
00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:54.070
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

1311
00:39:54.070 --> 00:39:54.610
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

1312
00:39:54.610 --> 00:39:55.930
<v Speaker 2>like if you push it down,</v>

1313
00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:59.290
<v Speaker 2>it recognizes that you're applying pressure on the screen so it can pop up a</v>

1314
00:39:59.291 --> 00:40:00.640
<v Speaker 2>second menu based on that,</v>

1315
00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:02.800
<v Speaker 2>but you could also just program your phone.</v>

1316
00:40:02.801 --> 00:40:04.720
<v Speaker 2>If you hold something down for two seconds,</v>

1317
00:40:04.721 --> 00:40:06.010
<v Speaker 2>they will pop up as second [inaudible].</v>

1318
00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:07.450
<v Speaker 2>We already have that kind of,</v>

1319
00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:07.841
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1320
00:40:07.841 --> 00:40:08.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't see the big.</v>

1321
00:40:09.530 --> 00:40:13.120
<v Speaker 2>The phone actually physically it has a little teeny,</v>

1322
00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:13.961
<v Speaker 2>teeny,</v>

1323
00:40:13.961 --> 00:40:17.470
<v Speaker 2>teeny thing and it also has a little vibrate that's a little bit more powerful.</v>

1324
00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:19.360
<v Speaker 2>How often is that going to go off in your pocket?</v>

1325
00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:20.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1326
00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:21.910
<v Speaker 2>like move some shit.</v>

1327
00:40:21.911 --> 00:40:22.390
<v Speaker 2>Your keys,</v>

1328
00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:22.920
<v Speaker 2>touch it,</v>

1329
00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:23.560
<v Speaker 2>clicks.</v>

1330
00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:26.110
<v Speaker 2>The other thing was that they made a big deal about how like,</v>

1331
00:40:26.111 --> 00:40:26.381
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1332
00:40:26.381 --> 00:40:30.190
<v Speaker 2>we wanted to take the technology of the flash that that's on the new iphone and</v>

1333
00:40:30.191 --> 00:40:31.060
<v Speaker 2>put it in the front,</v>

1334
00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:32.500
<v Speaker 2>but then they didn't do that.</v>

1335
00:40:32.501 --> 00:40:35.830
<v Speaker 2>They just make the screen flash three times brighter and I used it and it did</v>

1336
00:40:35.831 --> 00:40:36.880
<v Speaker 2>work very well,</v>

1337
00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:38.080
<v Speaker 2>but for selfies,</v>

1338
00:40:38.110 --> 00:40:38.831
<v Speaker 2>for selfies,</v>

1339
00:40:38.831 --> 00:40:39.421
<v Speaker 2>but it won't,</v>

1340
00:40:39.421 --> 00:40:42.730
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't like get Jamie from way over there when I work for a video either,</v>

1341
00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:43.593
<v Speaker 2>like if you want to,</v>

1342
00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:45.490
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't work for a video.</v>

1343
00:40:45.491 --> 00:40:48.250
<v Speaker 2>So it's kind of like they're kind of side talking like,</v>

1344
00:40:48.251 --> 00:40:48.491
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1345
00:40:48.491 --> 00:40:49.660
<v Speaker 2>we want to put this flash,</v>

1346
00:40:49.661 --> 00:40:50.494
<v Speaker 2>but now we found no,</v>

1347
00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:54.700
<v Speaker 2>well it's whenever they have an s they don't go too far off the original.</v>

1348
00:40:54.730 --> 00:40:58.480
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes some people make the argument though that with the s version,</v>

1349
00:40:58.481 --> 00:40:59.590
<v Speaker 2>you're getting them more.</v>

1350
00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:02.710
<v Speaker 2>You're getting a refinement on the first gen device,</v>

1351
00:41:03.130 --> 00:41:05.740
<v Speaker 2>which could theoretically have problems.</v>

1352
00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:06.933
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1353
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:07.570
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

1354
00:41:07.570 --> 00:41:09.490
<v Speaker 2>not to toot my own horn here,</v>

1355
00:41:10.510 --> 00:41:12.120
<v Speaker 2>but get ready for the toot.</v>

1356
00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:16.870
<v Speaker 2>Getting too comfortable right now.</v>

1357
00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:17.793
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1358
00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:21.970
<v Speaker 2>but the video I made that got a lot of traction,</v>

1359
00:41:22.210 --> 00:41:24.040
<v Speaker 2>the bend test video,</v>

1360
00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:25.373
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1361
00:41:25.810 --> 00:41:26.470
<v Speaker 2>it sort of,</v>

1362
00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:29.680
<v Speaker 2>it sort of exposed a weak point in the device,</v>

1363
00:41:30.010 --> 00:41:31.960
<v Speaker 2>which was incredible by the way,</v>

1364
00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:32.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1365
00:41:32.670 --> 00:41:34.340
<v Speaker 2>which was around the volume buttons.</v>

1366
00:41:35.090 --> 00:41:39.950
<v Speaker 2>And I managed to get my hands on a leaked component recently for the upcoming</v>

1367
00:41:39.951 --> 00:41:44.951
<v Speaker 2>iphone and run some tests on it and it turns out that the next generation of the</v>

1368
00:41:45.501 --> 00:41:50.501
<v Speaker 2>phone is going to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 60 to 70 percent stronger</v>

1369
00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:56.440
<v Speaker 2>because they've added zinc to the aluminum structure with the aluminum alloy,</v>

1370
00:41:57.950 --> 00:42:01.310
<v Speaker 2>which turns it into something they call a 7,000 series aluminum.</v>

1371
00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:03.740
<v Speaker 2>And that's the stuff they use an aerospace,</v>

1372
00:42:03.741 --> 00:42:04.251
<v Speaker 2>Nassau,</v>

1373
00:42:04.251 --> 00:42:05.270
<v Speaker 2>so on and so forth.</v>

1374
00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:06.410
<v Speaker 2>And it,</v>

1375
00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:10.760
<v Speaker 2>it's essentially the just way stronger without adding any kind of weight.</v>

1376
00:42:10.761 --> 00:42:11.151
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

1377
00:42:11.151 --> 00:42:12.140
<v Speaker 2>the shell itself is,</v>

1378
00:42:12.141 --> 00:42:12.450
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

1379
00:42:12.450 --> 00:42:13.730
<v Speaker 2>was a little bit lighter.</v>

1380
00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:17.750
<v Speaker 2>So I did this test with this crazy contraption I took just the back shell.</v>

1381
00:42:17.751 --> 00:42:20.600
<v Speaker 2>So just the aluminum part from the regular six.</v>

1382
00:42:20.601 --> 00:42:25.601
<v Speaker 2>And then from the upcoming six s and the old one bent at 30 pounds of force.</v>

1383
00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:28.490
<v Speaker 2>And the new one was around 80 [inaudible].</v>

1384
00:42:28.670 --> 00:42:32.690
<v Speaker 2>And the reason I know about the existence of zinc and I dropped that information</v>

1385
00:42:32.691 --> 00:42:37.691
<v Speaker 2>before apple's keynote because I went to a place called elemental controls,</v>

1386
00:42:38.930 --> 00:42:43.930
<v Speaker 2>which is like this super crazy scientific joint where they have this gun that</v>

1387
00:42:44.151 --> 00:42:49.151
<v Speaker 2>shoots x-rays into any alloy and we'll tell you exactly down to like two decimal</v>

1388
00:42:49.941 --> 00:42:50.720
<v Speaker 2>points,</v>

1389
00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:53.210
<v Speaker 2>what the elemental makeup is.</v>

1390
00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:55.940
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty fucking bad ass.</v>

1391
00:42:55.970 --> 00:42:56.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1392
00:42:56.210 --> 00:42:56.571
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>

1393
00:42:56.571 --> 00:42:57.470
<v Speaker 2>Where's that place?</v>

1394
00:42:57.560 --> 00:42:58.130
<v Speaker 2>It was a,</v>

1395
00:42:58.130 --> 00:42:59.720
<v Speaker 2>it was near the airport in Toronto,</v>

1396
00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:00.051
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1397
00:43:00.051 --> 00:43:03.860
<v Speaker 2>shout out elemental controls because these guys were so bad ass.</v>

1398
00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:04.521
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1399
00:43:04.521 --> 00:43:04.671
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1400
00:43:04.671 --> 00:43:07.820
<v Speaker 2>I got this leaked iphone component and uh,</v>

1401
00:43:07.821 --> 00:43:08.660
<v Speaker 2>I might need your help.</v>

1402
00:43:08.661 --> 00:43:08.901
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

1403
00:43:08.901 --> 00:43:09.734
<v Speaker 2>come down right now.</v>

1404
00:43:11.590 --> 00:43:12.021
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1405
00:43:12.021 --> 00:43:12.411
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>

1406
00:43:12.411 --> 00:43:13.850
<v Speaker 2>They probably wanted to know too.</v>

1407
00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:15.470
<v Speaker 2>They were just as pumped as I was.</v>

1408
00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:17.460
<v Speaker 2>They were just as mean,</v>

1409
00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:17.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1410
00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:18.920
<v Speaker 2>a couple of old guys.</v>

1411
00:43:18.921 --> 00:43:20.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't their businesses normally like,</v>

1412
00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:21.610
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1413
00:43:21.610 --> 00:43:21.940
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

1414
00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:24.350
<v Speaker 2>when someone's doing a big order of aluminum,</v>

1415
00:43:24.351 --> 00:43:26.510
<v Speaker 2>like buying a boat load from China,</v>

1416
00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:28.080
<v Speaker 2>literally they'll tell,</v>

1417
00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:32.570
<v Speaker 2>sometimes scam you and say that you're getting this alloy when it might look</v>

1418
00:43:32.571 --> 00:43:35.150
<v Speaker 2>exactly the same as one that's Chintzy on the zinc,</v>

1419
00:43:35.151 --> 00:43:36.230
<v Speaker 2>let's say for example,</v>

1420
00:43:36.250 --> 00:43:41.250
<v Speaker 2>and so they can just go through sheets of this stuff with this gun and make sure</v>

1421
00:43:41.391 --> 00:43:43.010
<v Speaker 2>they're buying what they think they're buying.</v>

1422
00:43:43.970 --> 00:43:45.270
<v Speaker 2>What about the news glass?</v>

1423
00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:47.440
<v Speaker 2>They're not using the new gorilla glass on there.</v>

1424
00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:49.970
<v Speaker 2>It's a double,</v>

1425
00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:53.210
<v Speaker 2>some kind of double version of their ion x coding.</v>

1426
00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:56.210
<v Speaker 2>I have the glass as well at my studio,</v>

1427
00:43:56.510 --> 00:44:01.220
<v Speaker 2>so when I get back I'm going to be doing a preemptive scratch test to see how</v>

1428
00:44:01.221 --> 00:44:01.830
<v Speaker 2>much better it is.</v>

1429
00:44:01.830 --> 00:44:03.190
<v Speaker 2>Let's put that bitch on a target.</v>

1430
00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:04.813
<v Speaker 2>I'm interested.</v>

1431
00:44:05.570 --> 00:44:09.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm interested in that because the iphone six and the six plus I are the first</v>

1432
00:44:09.441 --> 00:44:10.850
<v Speaker 2>two phones that I've had,</v>

1433
00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:14.150
<v Speaker 2>like every single phone that I've actually cracked and I thought it was</v>

1434
00:44:14.151 --> 00:44:17.540
<v Speaker 2>interesting that both that also coincides with some heavy fucking drinking.</v>

1435
00:44:18.810 --> 00:44:20.170
<v Speaker 2>You have to think about that now.</v>

1436
00:44:21.050 --> 00:44:22.130
<v Speaker 2>You've been on a bender,</v>

1437
00:44:22.131 --> 00:44:24.190
<v Speaker 2>you talked about it on their phones.</v>

1438
00:44:24.210 --> 00:44:26.540
<v Speaker 2>I've been breaking like as an example,</v>

1439
00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:29.870
<v Speaker 2>my iphone six plus when I was getting out of my car,</v>

1440
00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:31.250
<v Speaker 2>it slid out of my pocket,</v>

1441
00:44:31.350 --> 00:44:34.050
<v Speaker 2>which was only like three feet when I'm getting out of my car.</v>

1442
00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:34.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean not even three feet,</v>

1443
00:44:35.070 --> 00:44:35.730
<v Speaker 2>two feet.</v>

1444
00:44:35.730 --> 00:44:36.810
<v Speaker 2>And it cracked it.</v>

1445
00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:37.210
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

1446
00:44:37.210 --> 00:44:38.700
<v Speaker 2>it was barely a fall.</v>

1447
00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:39.690
<v Speaker 2>And that seems weird.</v>

1448
00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:40.141
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1449
00:44:40.141 --> 00:44:40.920
<v Speaker 2>there is a,</v>

1450
00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:42.450
<v Speaker 2>there's a bit of a theory on that,</v>

1451
00:44:42.570 --> 00:44:43.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1452
00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:47.400
<v Speaker 2>about sort of the rigidity of the chassis or lack thereof that might contribute</v>

1453
00:44:47.401 --> 00:44:52.230
<v Speaker 2>to the glass having to bear the brunt of the impact even if you hit not directly</v>

1454
00:44:52.231 --> 00:44:52.930
<v Speaker 2>on it,</v>

1455
00:44:52.930 --> 00:44:53.340
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1456
00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:55.170
<v Speaker 2>That there might be enough flex in that,</v>

1457
00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:56.310
<v Speaker 2>in that aluminum will.</v>

1458
00:44:56.311 --> 00:44:57.270
<v Speaker 2>Speaking about like,</v>

1459
00:44:57.290 --> 00:44:57.660
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1460
00:44:57.660 --> 00:44:59.160
<v Speaker 2>cases like is there any,</v>

1461
00:44:59.190 --> 00:45:04.080
<v Speaker 2>did they have any really good cases that have power that gives you power?</v>

1462
00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:04.331
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1463
00:45:04.331 --> 00:45:04.511
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1464
00:45:04.511 --> 00:45:07.860
<v Speaker 2>they have that aren't gigantic or they have,</v>

1465
00:45:07.861 --> 00:45:11.310
<v Speaker 2>they shrunk those fuckers down yet they're all pretty fucking bad listening.</v>

1466
00:45:11.311 --> 00:45:11.611
<v Speaker 2>If you're,</v>

1467
00:45:11.611 --> 00:45:13.440
<v Speaker 2>if you're already on a six plus,</v>

1468
00:45:13.470 --> 00:45:15.840
<v Speaker 2>that's a big phone to diet to begin with.</v>

1469
00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:21.090
<v Speaker 2>You throw a bad tastes on there and you're carrying a brick around.</v>

1470
00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:22.433
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing,</v>

1471
00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:27.770
<v Speaker 2>this is my biggest criticism of what's happening happening in cell phone tech is</v>

1472
00:45:28.321 --> 00:45:29.230
<v Speaker 2>that they want to,</v>

1473
00:45:29.550 --> 00:45:32.790
<v Speaker 2>they want to make an impression on you when you come into the store and play</v>

1474
00:45:32.791 --> 00:45:33.480
<v Speaker 2>with the device.</v>

1475
00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:36.570
<v Speaker 2>So they're going to make it as thin as they possibly can.</v>

1476
00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:37.590
<v Speaker 2>So he come in there and you're like,</v>

1477
00:45:37.591 --> 00:45:37.771
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1478
00:45:37.771 --> 00:45:38.550
<v Speaker 2>that's so sexy.</v>

1479
00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:42.750
<v Speaker 2>I'll take it until three days later when it doesn't make it through the day</v>

1480
00:45:42.751 --> 00:45:45.240
<v Speaker 2>because the batteries is so small.</v>

1481
00:45:45.810 --> 00:45:46.650
<v Speaker 2>The next Gen,</v>

1482
00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:47.610
<v Speaker 2>here's the crazy thing,</v>

1483
00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:48.960
<v Speaker 2>the next gen iphone,</v>

1484
00:45:48.961 --> 00:45:50.670
<v Speaker 2>and they didn't even cover this in the keynote.</v>

1485
00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:52.800
<v Speaker 2>They did not talk about this at all.</v>

1486
00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:55.680
<v Speaker 2>The next Gen iphone will have a smaller battery than this one.</v>

1487
00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:57.540
<v Speaker 2>And how crazy is that?</v>

1488
00:45:57.541 --> 00:45:57.931
<v Speaker 2>Wait a minute.</v>

1489
00:45:57.931 --> 00:45:58.320
<v Speaker 2>Wait a minute.</v>

1490
00:45:58.320 --> 00:45:59.880
<v Speaker 2>The one after the ass.</v>

1491
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:00.181
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1492
00:46:00.181 --> 00:46:02.640
<v Speaker 2>the six s will have a smaller battery than the six.</v>

1493
00:46:02.641 --> 00:46:04.350
<v Speaker 2>So this is better than the success.</v>

1494
00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:09.000
<v Speaker 2>They will have a slight amount of battery life it like,</v>

1495
00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:12.270
<v Speaker 2>it's like it's like 80 milliamp hours or something like that.</v>

1496
00:46:12.650 --> 00:46:13.290
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1497
00:46:13.290 --> 00:46:15.850
<v Speaker 2>basically it means it's,</v>

1498
00:46:16.090 --> 00:46:16.430
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1499
00:46:16.430 --> 00:46:17.430
<v Speaker 2>it's insignificant,</v>

1500
00:46:17.730 --> 00:46:22.730
<v Speaker 2>but the point being is that they're not responding to be part of the consumer</v>

1501
00:46:22.771 --> 00:46:23.161
<v Speaker 2>demand,</v>

1502
00:46:23.161 --> 00:46:24.270
<v Speaker 2>which is my demand,</v>

1503
00:46:24.271 --> 00:46:25.350
<v Speaker 2>which has better battery life.</v>

1504
00:46:25.351 --> 00:46:25.890
<v Speaker 2>I'll take.</v>

1505
00:46:25.890 --> 00:46:28.140
<v Speaker 2>Would you take a slightly thicker version of that?</v>

1506
00:46:28.170 --> 00:46:28.770
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1507
00:46:28.770 --> 00:46:29.940
<v Speaker 2>For double the battery life?</v>

1508
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:30.361
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1509
00:46:30.361 --> 00:46:31.180
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1510
00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:33.120
<v Speaker 2>Well also this is not that thick.</v>

1511
00:46:33.270 --> 00:46:34.170
<v Speaker 2>This is nice.</v>

1512
00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:34.990
<v Speaker 2>Yay.</v>

1513
00:46:34.990 --> 00:46:37.470
<v Speaker 2>I like this that I have right here.</v>

1514
00:46:37.590 --> 00:46:37.831
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1515
00:46:37.831 --> 00:46:40.230
<v Speaker 2>that is pretty Goddamn thin if you need it sooner than that.</v>

1516
00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:40.920
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1517
00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:41.880
<v Speaker 2>but what I'm saying,</v>

1518
00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:42.900
<v Speaker 2>what they need,</v>

1519
00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:43.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean why are they making it thin?</v>

1520
00:46:44.010 --> 00:46:44.161
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1521
00:46:44.161 --> 00:46:45.600
<v Speaker 2>he's saying he made it thicker,</v>

1522
00:46:45.690 --> 00:46:46.080
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

1523
00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:46.950
<v Speaker 2>that's not what he's saying.</v>

1524
00:46:47.010 --> 00:46:50.640
<v Speaker 2>What he's saying is that this new one is thinner and somehow the batteries</v>

1525
00:46:50.641 --> 00:46:51.450
<v Speaker 2>thinner.</v>

1526
00:46:51.450 --> 00:46:52.283
<v Speaker 2>Smaller,</v>

1527
00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:52.711
<v Speaker 2>small.</v>

1528
00:46:52.711 --> 00:46:56.100
<v Speaker 2>I think part of it has to do with some of the internal components taking up more</v>

1529
00:46:56.101 --> 00:46:56.934
<v Speaker 2>space.</v>

1530
00:46:56.970 --> 00:46:57.790
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1531
00:46:57.790 --> 00:46:58.380
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1532
00:46:58.380 --> 00:46:59.640
<v Speaker 2>like this chassis,</v>

1533
00:46:59.641 --> 00:47:01.990
<v Speaker 2>like what you've got here will be the exact same on the new one.</v>

1534
00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:03.720
<v Speaker 2>It'll be actually a little bit bigger.</v>

1535
00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:06.570
<v Speaker 2>It would be thicker a little bit because of these new materials because they</v>

1536
00:47:06.571 --> 00:47:07.410
<v Speaker 2>want it to be rigid,</v>

1537
00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:08.220
<v Speaker 2>more rigid.</v>

1538
00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:08.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1539
00:47:08.490 --> 00:47:12.030
<v Speaker 2>So it's part of the rigidity is the adding of zinc and part of it is the fact</v>

1540
00:47:12.031 --> 00:47:13.110
<v Speaker 2>that they're making it thicker.</v>

1541
00:47:13.650 --> 00:47:13.951
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1542
00:47:13.951 --> 00:47:15.480
<v Speaker 2>They're reinforcing certain areas.</v>

1543
00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:17.170
<v Speaker 2>So like I'm near the volume.</v>

1544
00:47:17.171 --> 00:47:19.740
<v Speaker 2>Why would they do that and take the battery life down?</v>

1545
00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:20.281
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1546
00:47:20.281 --> 00:47:20.751
<v Speaker 2>Well and,</v>

1547
00:47:20.751 --> 00:47:20.990
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1548
00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:24.780
<v Speaker 2>but that's the thing is that they never had an s model where they've really</v>

1549
00:47:24.781 --> 00:47:27.720
<v Speaker 2>reconfigured the layout maybe in the next version.</v>

1550
00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:29.890
<v Speaker 2>But usually for the s model it looks,</v>

1551
00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:31.180
<v Speaker 2>it looks exactly the same.</v>

1552
00:47:31.181 --> 00:47:31.570
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1553
00:47:31.570 --> 00:47:31.900
<v Speaker 2>They don't,</v>

1554
00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:33.220
<v Speaker 2>they don't come out with a fresh version.</v>

1555
00:47:33.221 --> 00:47:33.610
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1556
00:47:33.610 --> 00:47:36.580
<v Speaker 2>There's sort of a manufacturing setup is not,</v>

1557
00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:37.960
<v Speaker 2>is not right for that.</v>

1558
00:47:37.990 --> 00:47:41.770
<v Speaker 2>So it seems so silly though because they obviously are making it slightly</v>

1559
00:47:41.771 --> 00:47:43.660
<v Speaker 2>different because they're making it thicker inside there.</v>

1560
00:47:43.661 --> 00:47:43.901
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1561
00:47:43.901 --> 00:47:48.190
<v Speaker 2>They're doing their feeling is that it shouldn't look to the average person if</v>

1562
00:47:48.191 --> 00:47:49.270
<v Speaker 2>they pick up one or the other,</v>

1563
00:47:49.271 --> 00:47:50.530
<v Speaker 2>they'll look and feel the same.</v>

1564
00:47:50.890 --> 00:47:51.260
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>

1565
00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:55.660
<v Speaker 2>what if you had just like this size but just a little thicker and maybe a little</v>

1566
00:47:55.661 --> 00:47:56.321
<v Speaker 2>more durable.</v>

1567
00:47:56.321 --> 00:47:57.340
<v Speaker 2>So you would need a case.</v>

1568
00:47:57.341 --> 00:47:57.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1569
00:47:57.580 --> 00:47:58.160
<v Speaker 2>Well that.</v>

1570
00:47:58.160 --> 00:47:58.880
<v Speaker 2>Check this out.</v>

1571
00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:00.820
<v Speaker 2>He is that the Samsung active,</v>

1572
00:48:00.821 --> 00:48:02.230
<v Speaker 2>so this is exactly what that is.</v>

1573
00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:05.470
<v Speaker 2>So this phone here that I'm carrying is the Essex active.</v>

1574
00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:08.360
<v Speaker 2>This is the one that they have that's waterproof and water.</v>

1575
00:48:08.650 --> 00:48:09.160
<v Speaker 2>The main,</v>

1576
00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:10.690
<v Speaker 2>the waterproof part is cool.</v>

1577
00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:11.800
<v Speaker 2>This doesn't have a case on it?</v>

1578
00:48:11.890 --> 00:48:12.430
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

1579
00:48:12.430 --> 00:48:13.270
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1580
00:48:13.470 --> 00:48:13.920
<v Speaker 2>That's built in.</v>

1581
00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:15.310
<v Speaker 2>That's like a man's phone right there.</v>

1582
00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:16.030
<v Speaker 2>I feel like a man.</v>

1583
00:48:16.030 --> 00:48:16.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1584
00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:17.201
<v Speaker 2>that's a tool.</v>

1585
00:48:17.201 --> 00:48:18.034
<v Speaker 2>That's not a toy.</v>

1586
00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:20.270
<v Speaker 2>What do you got there?</v>

1587
00:48:20.270 --> 00:48:21.103
<v Speaker 2>John?</v>

1588
00:48:21.170 --> 00:48:21.660
<v Speaker 2>Brian.</v>

1589
00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:23.000
<v Speaker 2>That's fine.</v>

1590
00:48:24.460 --> 00:48:26.480
<v Speaker 2>Just a comparison of like the thickness of it,</v>

1591
00:48:26.530 --> 00:48:28.240
<v Speaker 2>but that means it's too thick for you.</v>

1592
00:48:28.450 --> 00:48:28.930
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1593
00:48:28.930 --> 00:48:29.231
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1594
00:48:29.231 --> 00:48:29.440
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1595
00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:31.630
<v Speaker 2>That has a 3,500 milliamp hour battery.</v>

1596
00:48:31.631 --> 00:48:33.430
<v Speaker 2>That never dies on me before I go to bed.</v>

1597
00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:35.710
<v Speaker 2>So this is the one that's waterproof.</v>

1598
00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:36.250
<v Speaker 2>The whole deal.</v>

1599
00:48:36.250 --> 00:48:37.750
<v Speaker 2>Shock resistant dust proof.</v>

1600
00:48:37.751 --> 00:48:38.260
<v Speaker 2>I take.</v>

1601
00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:39.093
<v Speaker 2>Take it in the shower.</v>

1602
00:48:39.130 --> 00:48:40.670
<v Speaker 2>Just the fucking phone but.</v>

1603
00:48:40.810 --> 00:48:42.160
<v Speaker 2>But Shit.</v>

1604
00:48:42.670 --> 00:48:43.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1605
00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:46.210
<v Speaker 2>but there's a but it is an 18 t exclusive.</v>

1606
00:48:46.330 --> 00:48:47.470
<v Speaker 2>Oh fuck.</v>

1607
00:48:48.550 --> 00:48:49.780
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck?</v>

1608
00:48:50.350 --> 00:48:51.183
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

1609
00:48:51.190 --> 00:48:51.731
<v Speaker 2>Terrible.</v>

1610
00:48:51.731 --> 00:48:55.140
<v Speaker 2>But you can do a and t t unlocked and put onto mobile.</v>

1611
00:48:55.141 --> 00:48:55.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1612
00:48:55.380 --> 00:48:55.930
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1613
00:48:55.930 --> 00:48:56.111
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1614
00:48:56.111 --> 00:48:59.890
<v Speaker 2>This is really that much better than 18 and t way better while around here.</v>

1615
00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:00.611
<v Speaker 2>Around here.</v>

1616
00:49:00.611 --> 00:49:01.600
<v Speaker 2>In my experience.</v>

1617
00:49:01.630 --> 00:49:02.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1618
00:49:02.110 --> 00:49:03.160
<v Speaker 2>and also in Vegas</v>

1619
00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:07.900
<v Speaker 2>so you could get this unlocked and then you bring it to t mobile.</v>

1620
00:49:07.901 --> 00:49:08.950
<v Speaker 2>You've got to be getting a phone call.</v>

1621
00:49:08.951 --> 00:49:09.850
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to fuck.</v>

1622
00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:10.780
<v Speaker 2>Tell him to fuck off.</v>

1623
00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:13.780
<v Speaker 2>We're want show.</v>

1624
00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:14.780
<v Speaker 2>How do I do that?</v>

1625
00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:15.550
<v Speaker 2>I slide it.</v>

1626
00:49:15.550 --> 00:49:16.383
<v Speaker 2>Slide that over.</v>

1627
00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:17.260
<v Speaker 2>Well that's annoying too.</v>

1628
00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:21.700
<v Speaker 2>One thing that I thought was weird that they did in the keynote where they said</v>

1629
00:49:21.701 --> 00:49:24.190
<v Speaker 2>the battery was not as strong as the six.</v>

1630
00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:24.611
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>

1631
00:49:24.611 --> 00:49:24.910
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1632
00:49:24.910 --> 00:49:27.070
<v Speaker 2>the new operating system,</v>

1633
00:49:27.071 --> 00:49:29.020
<v Speaker 2>it's going to give you an hour more battery.</v>

1634
00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:30.530
<v Speaker 2>Well it.</v>

1635
00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:31.630
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1636
00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:32.201
<v Speaker 2>but they.</v>

1637
00:49:32.201 --> 00:49:35.950
<v Speaker 2>I just updated the operating system on my sixth so I can an hour more battery</v>

1638
00:49:35.951 --> 00:49:37.080
<v Speaker 2>life on this one also.</v>

1639
00:49:37.090 --> 00:49:37.811
<v Speaker 2>So you're radically.</v>

1640
00:49:37.811 --> 00:49:38.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1641
00:49:38.110 --> 00:49:38.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1642
00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:40.390
<v Speaker 2>but you don't even know just up.</v>

1643
00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:41.680
<v Speaker 2>It's probably going to suck.</v>

1644
00:49:41.681 --> 00:49:42.280
<v Speaker 2>They're going to,</v>

1645
00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:43.113
<v Speaker 2>they're going to fuck you.</v>

1646
00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:44.230
<v Speaker 2>Just like they always do.</v>

1647
00:49:44.231 --> 00:49:45.940
<v Speaker 2>Always do software updates.</v>

1648
00:49:45.941 --> 00:49:46.301
<v Speaker 2>Always.</v>

1649
00:49:46.301 --> 00:49:46.721
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you.</v>

1650
00:49:46.721 --> 00:49:47.051
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1651
00:49:47.051 --> 00:49:49.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm never on the forefront of it.</v>

1652
00:49:49.121 --> 00:49:50.790
<v Speaker 2>Not on my main device to the.</v>

1653
00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:52.210
<v Speaker 2>I like this a lot,</v>

1654
00:49:52.211 --> 00:49:52.960
<v Speaker 2>so man's phone.</v>

1655
00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:53.793
<v Speaker 2>What's it called again?</v>

1656
00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:55.990
<v Speaker 2>The active active,</v>

1657
00:49:56.020 --> 00:49:56.853
<v Speaker 2>yet.</v>

1658
00:49:56.860 --> 00:49:57.790
<v Speaker 2>I like it a lot.</v>

1659
00:49:58.140 --> 00:50:00.530
<v Speaker 2>I've got two different time zones on there to see you.</v>

1660
00:50:00.531 --> 00:50:00.870
<v Speaker 2>Don't do them.</v>

1661
00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:01.840
<v Speaker 2>You know what time it is at home.</v>

1662
00:50:01.970 --> 00:50:02.680
<v Speaker 2>What I'm doing,</v>

1663
00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:03.190
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1664
00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:04.023
<v Speaker 2>this is a.</v>

1665
00:50:04.170 --> 00:50:06.100
<v Speaker 2>it's also got a programmable button on it.</v>

1666
00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:07.060
<v Speaker 2>This one right here,</v>

1667
00:50:07.630 --> 00:50:11.650
<v Speaker 2>which you can configure as a shortcut for anything you want so you can make it a</v>

1668
00:50:11.651 --> 00:50:12.281
<v Speaker 2>voice recorder.</v>

1669
00:50:12.281 --> 00:50:15.410
<v Speaker 2>Like if cops were fucking with whatever your favorite thing to launches.</v>

1670
00:50:15.790 --> 00:50:16.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1671
00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:18.280
<v Speaker 2>making launch anything instantly from there.</v>

1672
00:50:18.430 --> 00:50:23.430
<v Speaker 2>If a girl band is trying to get arrested and explaining how she's about to try</v>

1673
00:50:25.751 --> 00:50:26.670
<v Speaker 2>to get you arrested.</v>

1674
00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:27.330
<v Speaker 2>Red.</v>

1675
00:50:27.330 --> 00:50:28.163
<v Speaker 2>Probably a good time.</v>

1676
00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:29.630
<v Speaker 2>Calls nine one one.</v>

1677
00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:29.841
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1678
00:50:29.841 --> 00:50:30.674
<v Speaker 2>I called nine.</v>

1679
00:50:31.570 --> 00:50:31.760
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>

1680
00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:32.593
<v Speaker 2>let's get off that.</v>

1681
00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:34.830
<v Speaker 2>I liked the topic yet.</v>

1682
00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:36.170
<v Speaker 2>I like that phone a lot.</v>

1683
00:50:36.410 --> 00:50:36.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1684
00:50:36.770 --> 00:50:38.990
<v Speaker 2>so this is kind of really frustrated.</v>

1685
00:50:39.020 --> 00:50:39.980
<v Speaker 2>The apple thing.</v>

1686
00:50:40.010 --> 00:50:42.500
<v Speaker 2>That's just one thing though.</v>

1687
00:50:42.501 --> 00:50:44.270
<v Speaker 2>We're talking to a lot of shit about apple here.</v>

1688
00:50:44.271 --> 00:50:47.180
<v Speaker 2>I think that there's one thing that remains to be seen and that's the camera.</v>

1689
00:50:48.530 --> 00:50:51.380
<v Speaker 2>The camera on and next model will be an improvement.</v>

1690
00:50:51.381 --> 00:50:52.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm 100 percent positive.</v>

1691
00:50:52.970 --> 00:50:54.530
<v Speaker 2>It's a 12 megapixel.</v>

1692
00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:58.130
<v Speaker 2>It's going to shoot four k and apple knows it.</v>

1693
00:50:58.350 --> 00:51:03.350
<v Speaker 2>The camera has been the battle ground of smart phones for the last five,</v>

1694
00:51:03.570 --> 00:51:04.403
<v Speaker 2>six years.</v>

1695
00:51:04.430 --> 00:51:05.600
<v Speaker 2>If you have the best camera,</v>

1696
00:51:05.601 --> 00:51:08.600
<v Speaker 2>you're going to cell phones and the prom for apple right now is they don't.</v>

1697
00:51:09.110 --> 00:51:12.320
<v Speaker 2>There's no argument that the s six camera is better.</v>

1698
00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:12.961
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1699
00:51:12.961 --> 00:51:14.240
<v Speaker 2>I guess you could make an argument.</v>

1700
00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:15.111
<v Speaker 2>Subjectivity,</v>

1701
00:51:15.111 --> 00:51:16.220
<v Speaker 2>color representation,</v>

1702
00:51:16.250 --> 00:51:16.491
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

1703
00:51:16.491 --> 00:51:16.641
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

1704
00:51:16.641 --> 00:51:17.300
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>

1705
00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:22.100
<v Speaker 2>The Essex shoots better photos than the current iphone and that's a big problem</v>

1706
00:51:22.101 --> 00:51:22.610
<v Speaker 2>for them.</v>

1707
00:51:22.610 --> 00:51:24.590
<v Speaker 2>So I fully suspect.</v>

1708
00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:26.870
<v Speaker 2>So the galaxy s six is what you're talking about.</v>

1709
00:51:26.871 --> 00:51:27.180
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

1710
00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:28.220
<v Speaker 2>So people that are listening to this</v>

1711
00:51:30.090 --> 00:51:30.460
<v Speaker 2>garden.</v>

1712
00:51:30.460 --> 00:51:30.651
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1713
00:51:30.651 --> 00:51:30.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1714
00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:32.000
<v Speaker 2>How perfect is it?</v>

1715
00:51:32.990 --> 00:51:34.670
<v Speaker 2>Six s and the six.</v>

1716
00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:35.840
<v Speaker 2>Those are the competing products,</v>

1717
00:51:35.860 --> 00:51:39.170
<v Speaker 2>the iphone and the galaxy s six.</v>

1718
00:51:39.171 --> 00:51:40.620
<v Speaker 2>So when he says Esx,</v>

1719
00:51:40.670 --> 00:51:41.660
<v Speaker 2>he's talking about this.</v>

1720
00:51:41.690 --> 00:51:42.020
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>

1721
00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:42.860
<v Speaker 2>what about the active?</v>

1722
00:51:42.861 --> 00:51:44.960
<v Speaker 2>Does it ss six active at the same camera?</v>

1723
00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:45.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1724
00:51:45.140 --> 00:51:46.430
<v Speaker 2>So this phone,</v>

1725
00:51:46.590 --> 00:51:46.940
<v Speaker 2>let's.</v>

1726
00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:48.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to take this out for a second.</v>

1727
00:51:48.460 --> 00:51:50.630
<v Speaker 2>That his phone is essentially now hardcore.</v>

1728
00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:51.921
<v Speaker 2>You know what,</v>

1729
00:51:51.921 --> 00:51:53.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad that we did though.</v>

1730
00:51:53.161 --> 00:51:54.470
<v Speaker 2>You know we got right into it.</v>

1731
00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:55.353
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1732
00:51:55.490 --> 00:51:57.500
<v Speaker 2>So this is this phone that's the same phone,</v>

1733
00:51:57.830 --> 00:51:58.190
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1734
00:51:58.190 --> 00:52:00.140
<v Speaker 2>Just the pretty version regular.</v>

1735
00:52:00.170 --> 00:52:01.370
<v Speaker 2>This is the active version.</v>

1736
00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:03.020
<v Speaker 2>I like the active version better at,</v>

1737
00:52:03.021 --> 00:52:05.310
<v Speaker 2>but you can see like form factor wise it's going,</v>

1738
00:52:05.330 --> 00:52:08.630
<v Speaker 2>you're going to add a little bit but you don't have to worry about dropping it.</v>

1739
00:52:08.631 --> 00:52:09.740
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to have a case on it.</v>

1740
00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:10.580
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

1741
00:52:10.580 --> 00:52:11.413
<v Speaker 2>And Better Bank.</v>

1742
00:52:11.450 --> 00:52:12.540
<v Speaker 2>And you have wind.</v>

1743
00:52:12.700 --> 00:52:15.260
<v Speaker 2>You have like 25 percent more battery life.</v>

1744
00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:18.460
<v Speaker 2>Twenty five percent more than the ESX regular bases.</v>

1745
00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:19.910
<v Speaker 2>A $3,500,</v>

1746
00:52:19.911 --> 00:52:20.930
<v Speaker 2>million million amp hours.</v>

1747
00:52:20.931 --> 00:52:22.130
<v Speaker 2>I think this is 2,700.</v>

1748
00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:26.180
<v Speaker 2>So I mean I probably have my math lab but why hasn't apple smarten up and make</v>

1749
00:52:26.181 --> 00:52:26.900
<v Speaker 2>one of those?</v>

1750
00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:30.170
<v Speaker 2>I took out my old iphone one the other day and it was like this cute little</v>

1751
00:52:30.171 --> 00:52:31.370
<v Speaker 2>pebble in with little.</v>

1752
00:52:31.371 --> 00:52:32.480
<v Speaker 2>Had a little weight to it,</v>

1753
00:52:32.510 --> 00:52:36.680
<v Speaker 2>but I was thinking what if they just redid the idea of that making it a little</v>

1754
00:52:36.681 --> 00:52:40.220
<v Speaker 2>thicker and having a battery that lasts two days because it actually felt good.</v>

1755
00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:41.480
<v Speaker 2>I didn't care about the iphone.</v>

1756
00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:43.310
<v Speaker 2>I always have a case on this anyway,</v>

1757
00:52:43.311 --> 00:52:44.690
<v Speaker 2>so it's always slightly thicker.</v>

1758
00:52:44.740 --> 00:52:45.020
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1759
00:52:45.020 --> 00:52:47.180
<v Speaker 2>Like when I feel this right here,</v>

1760
00:52:47.181 --> 00:52:47.931
<v Speaker 2>like this size.</v>

1761
00:52:47.931 --> 00:52:50.060
<v Speaker 2>This is pretty thin when I feel that though.</v>

1762
00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:50.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1763
00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:51.500
<v Speaker 2>That's not like.</v>

1764
00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:52.700
<v Speaker 2>This is like what?</v>

1765
00:52:52.701 --> 00:52:54.260
<v Speaker 2>This would be with a case on it,</v>

1766
00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:55.310
<v Speaker 2>but this is better.</v>

1767
00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:58.160
<v Speaker 2>It's better to build it in like that door.</v>

1768
00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:00.620
<v Speaker 2>Everybody drops her fucking phone at some point.</v>

1769
00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:01.371
<v Speaker 2>At some point.</v>

1770
00:53:01.371 --> 00:53:02.780
<v Speaker 2>Why not make a phone that you can drop?</v>

1771
00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:05.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean we're not talking about laptops or spill on.</v>

1772
00:53:06.380 --> 00:53:07.200
<v Speaker 2>This is the shelter.</v>

1773
00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:07.610
<v Speaker 2>Big One.</v>

1774
00:53:07.610 --> 00:53:07.821
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1775
00:53:07.821 --> 00:53:08.250
<v Speaker 2>Spills.</v>

1776
00:53:08.250 --> 00:53:09.081
<v Speaker 2>Spill is huge.</v>

1777
00:53:09.081 --> 00:53:10.100
<v Speaker 2>I've soaked that thing.</v>

1778
00:53:10.130 --> 00:53:10.550
<v Speaker 2>I've done.</v>

1779
00:53:10.550 --> 00:53:11.100
<v Speaker 2>I've put it.</v>

1780
00:53:11.100 --> 00:53:12.860
<v Speaker 2>I submerged completely under glass.</v>

1781
00:53:13.850 --> 00:53:14.640
<v Speaker 2>That's next.</v>

1782
00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:16.250
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the next step.</v>

1783
00:53:16.251 --> 00:53:17.084
<v Speaker 2>P test.</v>

1784
00:53:17.210 --> 00:53:18.950
<v Speaker 2>Pee test belt to blow up youtube.</v>

1785
00:53:18.951 --> 00:53:20.120
<v Speaker 2>This is pretty dope dude.</v>

1786
00:53:20.310 --> 00:53:20.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1787
00:53:20.750 --> 00:53:21.560
<v Speaker 2>I like it.</v>

1788
00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:23.630
<v Speaker 2>And you can get to the Canberra right from there.</v>

1789
00:53:23.810 --> 00:53:24.381
<v Speaker 2>And the camera.</v>

1790
00:53:24.381 --> 00:53:25.770
<v Speaker 2>And this is better than the iphone camera,</v>

1791
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:26.701
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion.</v>

1792
00:53:26.701 --> 00:53:27.534
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

1793
00:53:27.870 --> 00:53:29.910
<v Speaker 2>It just took a selfie that's on your phone?</v>

1794
00:53:29.980 --> 00:53:30.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1795
00:53:30.330 --> 00:53:30.541
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1796
00:53:30.541 --> 00:53:30.741
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1797
00:53:30.741 --> 00:53:31.051
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1798
00:53:31.051 --> 00:53:31.920
<v Speaker 2>the selfie camera.</v>

1799
00:53:31.921 --> 00:53:33.100
<v Speaker 2>Especially because it's,</v>

1800
00:53:33.140 --> 00:53:34.260
<v Speaker 2>it's way wider.</v>

1801
00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:35.670
<v Speaker 2>It's way wider.</v>

1802
00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:35.881
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1803
00:53:35.881 --> 00:53:36.631
<v Speaker 2>it's way wider.</v>

1804
00:53:36.631 --> 00:53:37.470
<v Speaker 2>So you could get like two,</v>

1805
00:53:37.471 --> 00:53:39.090
<v Speaker 2>three people in there a lot easier.</v>

1806
00:53:39.150 --> 00:53:40.560
<v Speaker 2>I tried the new angle.</v>

1807
00:53:40.580 --> 00:53:42.840
<v Speaker 2>They new selfie camera on the new iphone.</v>

1808
00:53:42.841 --> 00:53:43.770
<v Speaker 2>Compared it to my.</v>

1809
00:53:43.771 --> 00:53:45.300
<v Speaker 2>I took two comparison shots,</v>

1810
00:53:45.301 --> 00:53:50.190
<v Speaker 2>one of the six and one six s and it almost seemed to be exactly the same.</v>

1811
00:53:50.190 --> 00:53:51.690
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't a huge deal on the front.</v>

1812
00:53:51.691 --> 00:53:54.660
<v Speaker 2>Facing the front facing front facing won't be a huge change.</v>

1813
00:53:54.661 --> 00:53:54.990
<v Speaker 2>It'll be.</v>

1814
00:53:54.990 --> 00:53:56.610
<v Speaker 2>It'll be all about the rear camera.</v>

1815
00:53:56.850 --> 00:53:59.520
<v Speaker 2>So that might be the phone to get right now.</v>

1816
00:53:59.970 --> 00:54:00.420
<v Speaker 2>Which one?</v>

1817
00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:01.500
<v Speaker 2>The s six active.</v>

1818
00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:02.610
<v Speaker 2>If the pro.</v>

1819
00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:03.181
<v Speaker 2>Here's the problem.</v>

1820
00:54:03.181 --> 00:54:04.830
<v Speaker 2>Most people don't buy their phones outright.</v>

1821
00:54:05.190 --> 00:54:05.791
<v Speaker 2>They go in,</v>

1822
00:54:05.791 --> 00:54:06.571
<v Speaker 2>they get a subsidy,</v>

1823
00:54:06.571 --> 00:54:07.560
<v Speaker 2>they sign a contract,</v>

1824
00:54:07.590 --> 00:54:08.070
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1825
00:54:08.070 --> 00:54:09.990
<v Speaker 2>So if you want an essex active,</v>

1826
00:54:10.020 --> 00:54:11.100
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have to buy it full.</v>

1827
00:54:11.101 --> 00:54:13.410
<v Speaker 2>Pop off a t and t if you're not on a t and t,</v>

1828
00:54:13.411 --> 00:54:14.244
<v Speaker 2>that's the only way.</v>

1829
00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:18.040
<v Speaker 2>Or people from Samsung when they don't have it already.</v>

1830
00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:22.710
<v Speaker 2>I don't have now because I think it's because it's an atnt exclusive.</v>

1831
00:54:22.711 --> 00:54:24.390
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of like a weird phone.</v>

1832
00:54:24.391 --> 00:54:24.790
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

1833
00:54:24.790 --> 00:54:26.090
<v Speaker 2>Could they not have it if they're the.</v>

1834
00:54:26.091 --> 00:54:26.970
<v Speaker 2>They're the hookup.</v>

1835
00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:29.640
<v Speaker 2>They offered us the white glove service,</v>

1836
00:54:30.030 --> 00:54:31.170
<v Speaker 2>the white glove service.</v>

1837
00:54:32.140 --> 00:54:36.420
<v Speaker 2>I do not know what's happened is nobody stays in the white glove service.</v>

1838
00:54:37.110 --> 00:54:38.550
<v Speaker 2>We show up at the comedy store.</v>

1839
00:54:38.580 --> 00:54:43.200
<v Speaker 2>They show up with phones that give us a bag and then we'll go get a little hug,</v>

1840
00:54:43.890 --> 00:54:45.290
<v Speaker 2>a handshake,</v>

1841
00:54:45.291 --> 00:54:45.990
<v Speaker 2>and it's done.</v>

1842
00:54:45.990 --> 00:54:46.231
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1843
00:54:46.231 --> 00:54:47.160
<v Speaker 2>They'll send you a chip.</v>

1844
00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:50.250
<v Speaker 2>Put a little card in there.</v>

1845
00:54:50.670 --> 00:54:50.881
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1846
00:54:50.881 --> 00:54:51.714
<v Speaker 2>It's um,</v>

1847
00:54:52.150 --> 00:54:52.983
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1848
00:54:53.010 --> 00:54:55.290
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a good time for phones.</v>

1849
00:54:55.291 --> 00:54:55.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1850
00:54:55.930 --> 00:55:00.570
<v Speaker 2>it's fascinating that everyone has to compete at this level because if you look</v>

1851
00:55:00.571 --> 00:55:03.400
<v Speaker 2>at the evolution of phones over the iphone one,</v>

1852
00:55:03.401 --> 00:55:03.511
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>

1853
00:55:03.511 --> 00:55:04.680
<v Speaker 2>now we're only talking about.</v>

1854
00:55:04.681 --> 00:55:05.041
<v Speaker 2>What was that?</v>

1855
00:55:05.041 --> 00:55:06.000
<v Speaker 2>Two thousand nine.</v>

1856
00:55:06.210 --> 00:55:06.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1857
00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:08.550
<v Speaker 2>It's nothing that's fucking crazy.</v>

1858
00:55:08.790 --> 00:55:13.790
<v Speaker 2>So six years ago we had this little fat thing that lasted about an hour and that</v>

1859
00:55:15.361 --> 00:55:18.870
<v Speaker 2>little tiny screen and your thumb could cover the whole screen practically.</v>

1860
00:55:19.020 --> 00:55:22.820
<v Speaker 2>And now we have this big beautiful mini tablets,</v>

1861
00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:23.640
<v Speaker 2>a fablet right.</v>

1862
00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:23.850
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>

1863
00:55:23.850 --> 00:55:26.640
<v Speaker 2>is this technically a fablet or does it have to be bigger?</v>

1864
00:55:26.660 --> 00:55:26.760
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1865
00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:26.860
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1866
00:55:26.860 --> 00:55:26.970
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1867
00:55:26.970 --> 00:55:27.310
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1868
00:55:27.310 --> 00:55:28.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean you could call it that.</v>

1869
00:55:28.590 --> 00:55:32.160
<v Speaker 2>Although China is now pushing phones that are gigantic,</v>

1870
00:55:32.190 --> 00:55:34.230
<v Speaker 2>so it's hard to call it seven inches.</v>

1871
00:55:34.260 --> 00:55:34.950
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

1872
00:55:34.950 --> 00:55:35.430
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1873
00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:36.263
<v Speaker 2>What do they have?</v>

1874
00:55:36.690 --> 00:55:36.890
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1875
00:55:36.890 --> 00:55:38.640
<v Speaker 2>they have a mega.</v>

1876
00:55:38.950 --> 00:55:40.860
<v Speaker 2>Samsung still does have a mega in Asia.</v>

1877
00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:42.060
<v Speaker 2>They love in Asia.</v>

1878
00:55:42.740 --> 00:55:43.980
<v Speaker 2>Huge phones in Asia.</v>

1879
00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:45.090
<v Speaker 2>You can't get it in America.</v>

1880
00:55:45.450 --> 00:55:46.261
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe so.</v>

1881
00:55:46.261 --> 00:55:47.580
<v Speaker 2>Not from any of the major carriers.</v>

1882
00:55:47.900 --> 00:55:48.680
<v Speaker 2>Crock of Shit.</v>

1883
00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:49.620
<v Speaker 2>There's a company,</v>

1884
00:55:49.621 --> 00:55:49.841
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1885
00:55:49.841 --> 00:55:52.050
<v Speaker 2>that's emerging quickly called walway.</v>

1886
00:55:52.650 --> 00:55:54.360
<v Speaker 2>That does not feel good to say.</v>

1887
00:55:54.361 --> 00:55:55.710
<v Speaker 2>But that's the name of the company.</v>

1888
00:55:55.950 --> 00:55:56.790
<v Speaker 2>They're number three,</v>

1889
00:55:56.791 --> 00:55:57.690
<v Speaker 2>I believe right now.</v>

1890
00:55:57.691 --> 00:56:00.660
<v Speaker 2>As far as scale for a smartphone manufacturers,</v>

1891
00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:04.980
<v Speaker 2>they have various devices six inches and above,</v>

1892
00:56:05.070 --> 00:56:06.810
<v Speaker 2>like many a selection of them.</v>

1893
00:56:07.170 --> 00:56:08.040
<v Speaker 2>These things are.</v>

1894
00:56:08.100 --> 00:56:08.670
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1895
00:56:08.670 --> 00:56:09.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can imagine.</v>

1896
00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:10.230
<v Speaker 2>What's the,</v>

1897
00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:11.700
<v Speaker 2>what's the seven inch one called?</v>

1898
00:56:13.050 --> 00:56:13.883
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember,</v>

1899
00:56:14.070 --> 00:56:15.460
<v Speaker 2>but it's giant.</v>

1900
00:56:15.470 --> 00:56:16.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean had many.</v>

1901
00:56:16.820 --> 00:56:17.660
<v Speaker 2>How big it is.</v>

1902
00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:18.490
<v Speaker 2>It is that size.</v>

1903
00:56:18.490 --> 00:56:19.240
<v Speaker 2>While the Bezel,</v>

1904
00:56:19.240 --> 00:56:19.880
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

1905
00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:20.450
<v Speaker 2>They've done.</v>

1906
00:56:20.450 --> 00:56:21.330
<v Speaker 2>Had been these nine.</v>

1907
00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:23.190
<v Speaker 2>Is it nine or was it 77?</v>

1908
00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:23.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1909
00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:25.780
<v Speaker 2>the full size ipad is nine point seven.</v>

1910
00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:26.853
<v Speaker 2>They new one though.</v>

1911
00:56:26.910 --> 00:56:27.680
<v Speaker 2>The new ones.</v>

1912
00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:28.810
<v Speaker 2>There's a new one that's 12.</v>

1913
00:56:28.811 --> 00:56:29.350
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1914
00:56:29.350 --> 00:56:31.360
<v Speaker 2>You might want that 12 point nine.</v>

1915
00:56:31.510 --> 00:56:31.940
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1916
00:56:31.940 --> 00:56:34.180
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] you're into illustrations and whatnot.</v>

1917
00:56:34.210 --> 00:56:34.480
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1918
00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:35.080
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1919
00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:35.381
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1920
00:56:35.381 --> 00:56:36.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean with the pen,</v>

1921
00:56:36.281 --> 00:56:37.060
<v Speaker 2>it's unbelievable.</v>

1922
00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:37.191
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1923
00:56:37.191 --> 00:56:38.350
<v Speaker 2>What I like drawing on paper.</v>

1924
00:56:38.410 --> 00:56:40.360
<v Speaker 2>You would never even consider it.</v>

1925
00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:40.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1926
00:56:40.930 --> 00:56:43.240
<v Speaker 2>I would consider it because what I was saying earlier,</v>

1927
00:56:43.241 --> 00:56:43.811
<v Speaker 2>it's like the,</v>

1928
00:56:43.811 --> 00:56:44.644
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1929
00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:46.360
<v Speaker 2>the ipad pro,</v>

1930
00:56:46.361 --> 00:56:50.530
<v Speaker 2>the upcoming ipad has the highest resolution display of anything that apple's</v>

1931
00:56:50.531 --> 00:56:51.071
<v Speaker 2>ever put out.</v>

1932
00:56:51.071 --> 00:56:51.880
<v Speaker 2>Actually.</v>

1933
00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:55.630
<v Speaker 2>Maybe arguably anything commercially available in the tablet space.</v>

1934
00:56:55.631 --> 00:56:56.350
<v Speaker 2>Phone space.</v>

1935
00:56:56.350 --> 00:56:56.471
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1936
00:56:56.471 --> 00:56:59.110
<v Speaker 2>how long before someone makes a vr and slaps that suffering?</v>

1937
00:57:00.530 --> 00:57:01.363
<v Speaker 2>That would be,</v>

1938
00:57:01.930 --> 00:57:02.500
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

1939
00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:03.610
<v Speaker 2>Get a nice field of view.</v>

1940
00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:04.391
<v Speaker 2>That'd be perfect.</v>

1941
00:57:04.391 --> 00:57:05.830
<v Speaker 2>And they make this touch sensitive.</v>

1942
00:57:05.950 --> 00:57:10.090
<v Speaker 2>It almost seems like that would make more sense to have the ipad pro be touch</v>

1943
00:57:10.091 --> 00:57:13.030
<v Speaker 2>sensitive instead of using a pin that's touched sensitive.</v>

1944
00:57:13.070 --> 00:57:14.500
<v Speaker 2>If more people are going to draw on it.</v>

1945
00:57:14.501 --> 00:57:15.400
<v Speaker 2>Like this antique.</v>

1946
00:57:15.510 --> 00:57:16.600
<v Speaker 2>It's pressure sensitive.</v>

1947
00:57:17.850 --> 00:57:18.560
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1948
00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:19.870
<v Speaker 2>Syntech is a drawing pad,</v>

1949
00:57:19.950 --> 00:57:20.210
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1950
00:57:20.210 --> 00:57:22.930
<v Speaker 2>and meaning it can detect the pressure.</v>

1951
00:57:22.931 --> 00:57:23.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1952
00:57:23.230 --> 00:57:23.830
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>

1953
00:57:23.830 --> 00:57:24.663
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>

1954
00:57:24.820 --> 00:57:28.760
<v Speaker 2>It almost seems like they're releasing it first on the iphone six just to,</v>

1955
00:57:28.780 --> 00:57:29.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1956
00:57:29.470 --> 00:57:31.210
<v Speaker 2>so the ipad pro to would have it.</v>

1957
00:57:31.270 --> 00:57:31.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1958
00:57:31.990 --> 00:57:32.471
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1959
00:57:32.471 --> 00:57:33.700
<v Speaker 2>I it.</v>

1960
00:57:33.810 --> 00:57:35.440
<v Speaker 2>That's a hard one for me to figure out.</v>

1961
00:57:35.460 --> 00:57:40.460
<v Speaker 2>I've been messing around with the note with the pen and trying my best to make</v>

1962
00:57:41.051 --> 00:57:43.650
<v Speaker 2>it a part of my day and it's,</v>

1963
00:57:43.651 --> 00:57:44.860
<v Speaker 2>it's a tough kind of.</v>

1964
00:57:44.910 --> 00:57:47.590
<v Speaker 2>It's a tough transition on a display this size,</v>

1965
00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:52.420
<v Speaker 2>but you can imagine like the pen is still far more precise than your finger</v>

1966
00:57:52.421 --> 00:57:53.254
<v Speaker 2>could ever be.</v>

1967
00:57:53.470 --> 00:57:53.741
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1968
00:57:53.741 --> 00:57:57.430
<v Speaker 2>Your finger could never select a single pixel on a high resolution screen.</v>

1969
00:57:57.850 --> 00:57:58.683
<v Speaker 2>It's not a point.</v>

1970
00:57:58.960 --> 00:57:59.241
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

1971
00:57:59.241 --> 00:58:01.230
<v Speaker 2>it's what's weird is like a.</v>

1972
00:58:01.870 --> 00:58:03.820
<v Speaker 2>If there were a little jar of ink here,</v>

1973
00:58:03.821 --> 00:58:04.080
<v Speaker 2>what I,</v>

1974
00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:07.060
<v Speaker 2>what would I choose to write with my finger,</v>

1975
00:58:07.061 --> 00:58:11.590
<v Speaker 2>dip it in there or the end that's decided like why did we choose in the</v>

1976
00:58:11.591 --> 00:58:16.240
<v Speaker 2>traditional world this and yet it seems so bizarre to carry that forward into</v>

1977
00:58:16.241 --> 00:58:17.074
<v Speaker 2>the digital world.</v>

1978
00:58:17.290 --> 00:58:20.080
<v Speaker 2>I think part of it has to do with the fact that there's no place.</v>

1979
00:58:20.170 --> 00:58:21.250
<v Speaker 2>There's no place for it.</v>

1980
00:58:21.251 --> 00:58:22.570
<v Speaker 2>You're using this thing on the go.</v>

1981
00:58:22.870 --> 00:58:24.160
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of arguments there,</v>

1982
00:58:24.161 --> 00:58:27.010
<v Speaker 2>but when it comes to a tablet that's almost always at home,</v>

1983
00:58:27.130 --> 00:58:28.300
<v Speaker 2>always on the couch.</v>

1984
00:58:28.580 --> 00:58:29.413
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1985
00:58:29.500 --> 00:58:31.600
<v Speaker 2>I just feel like maybe,</v>

1986
00:58:31.601 --> 00:58:31.930
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>

1987
00:58:31.930 --> 00:58:35.860
<v Speaker 2>maybe this could shift the paradigm and people will look at these things as</v>

1988
00:58:35.861 --> 00:58:37.060
<v Speaker 2>actual notepads.</v>

1989
00:58:37.210 --> 00:58:37.721
<v Speaker 2>Finally,</v>

1990
00:58:37.721 --> 00:58:38.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1991
00:58:38.260 --> 00:58:40.950
<v Speaker 2>I use the note five for awhile or the four,</v>

1992
00:58:40.970 --> 00:58:41.320
<v Speaker 2>four,</v>

1993
00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:41.610
<v Speaker 2>four,</v>

1994
00:58:41.610 --> 00:58:43.750
<v Speaker 2>three or whatever the fear is one of them.</v>

1995
00:58:43.830 --> 00:58:44.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1996
00:58:44.170 --> 00:58:45.520
<v Speaker 2>And I enjoyed the pen.</v>

1997
00:58:45.570 --> 00:58:46.120
<v Speaker 2>You used it.</v>

1998
00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:48.220
<v Speaker 2>I liked it for collecting images.</v>

1999
00:58:48.221 --> 00:58:49.054
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was really cool.</v>

2000
00:58:49.450 --> 00:58:51.730
<v Speaker 2>I could directly collect an image from,</v>

2001
00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:52.421
<v Speaker 2>from a thing,</v>

2002
00:58:52.421 --> 00:58:54.790
<v Speaker 2>and it would say save it for me and store it for me.</v>

2003
00:58:55.240 --> 00:58:59.770
<v Speaker 2>The fact that it was so easy to cut things and paste them and save them as</v>

2004
00:58:59.771 --> 00:59:00.520
<v Speaker 2>notes,</v>

2005
00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:00.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2006
00:59:00.910 --> 00:59:03.850
<v Speaker 2>I really liked that and I really liked you draw dicks on people's faces.</v>

2007
00:59:03.851 --> 00:59:05.860
<v Speaker 2>That's also perfectly happy with that.</v>

2008
00:59:06.010 --> 00:59:09.280
<v Speaker 2>I look at my one note picture that I have in here and it's just a dick.</v>

2009
00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:11.620
<v Speaker 2>That was the other thing that I really liked.</v>

2010
00:59:11.621 --> 00:59:13.960
<v Speaker 2>It actually linked up with evernote,</v>

2011
00:59:14.380 --> 00:59:15.100
<v Speaker 2>so um,</v>

2012
00:59:15.100 --> 00:59:16.180
<v Speaker 2>when I would draw,</v>

2013
00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:16.900
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2014
00:59:16.900 --> 00:59:17.800
<v Speaker 2>my notes out,</v>

2015
00:59:17.860 --> 00:59:18.880
<v Speaker 2>I would say something,</v>

2016
00:59:18.881 --> 00:59:22.040
<v Speaker 2>I would write like comedy notes out and then it would it with evernote</v>

2017
00:59:22.220 --> 00:59:27.220
<v Speaker 1>and then I would look at it as an actual drawing as the actual me writing the</v>

2018
00:59:28.131 --> 00:59:29.240
<v Speaker 1>physical words.</v>

2019
00:59:29.580 --> 00:59:31.970
<v Speaker 1>I still have it saved up on evernote and it's,</v>

2020
00:59:31.971 --> 00:59:32.990
<v Speaker 1>I like it a lot.</v>

2021
00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:34.580
<v Speaker 1>But you don't miss,</v>

2022
00:59:34.610 --> 00:59:36.170
<v Speaker 1>you don't miss not having it though.</v>

2023
00:59:36.240 --> 00:59:36.650
<v Speaker 1>Depends.</v>

2024
00:59:36.650 --> 00:59:37.020
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

2025
00:59:37.020 --> 00:59:38.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't miss it that much,</v>

2026
00:59:38.781 --> 00:59:39.550
<v Speaker 1>but if I,</v>

2027
00:59:39.550 --> 00:59:41.570
<v Speaker 1>it's not as much,</v>

2028
00:59:42.020 --> 00:59:45.680
<v Speaker 1>like I don't miss it as much as I like this phone better than that.</v>

2029
00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:47.210
<v Speaker 1>I understand what you like to see this.</v>

2030
00:59:47.211 --> 00:59:48.470
<v Speaker 1>I used to have them like that,</v>

2031
00:59:48.530 --> 00:59:49.360
<v Speaker 1>so I would draw.</v>

2032
00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:50.193
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>

2033
00:59:50.360 --> 00:59:50.601
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2034
00:59:50.601 --> 00:59:51.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean it saved them.</v>

2035
00:59:52.820 --> 00:59:53.061
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2036
00:59:53.061 --> 00:59:53.360
<v Speaker 1>there is.</v>

2037
00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:54.193
<v Speaker 1>I mean there is,</v>

2038
00:59:54.500 --> 00:59:55.460
<v Speaker 1>there is something.</v>

2039
00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:55.991
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2040
00:59:55.991 --> 00:59:58.910
<v Speaker 1>Then he gets through them so much easier than you could have notebook.</v>

2041
00:59:58.911 --> 00:59:59.480
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2042
00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:00.800
<v Speaker 1>And then just write it down like that.</v>

2043
01:00:00.830 --> 01:00:01.790
<v Speaker 1>There are definitely,</v>

2044
01:00:01.791 --> 01:00:03.200
<v Speaker 1>there are definitely advantages.</v>

2045
01:00:03.201 --> 01:00:05.630
<v Speaker 1>It's just about getting over this hurdle of usability.</v>

2046
01:00:05.630 --> 01:00:07.940
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like a smart watches as well.</v>

2047
01:00:08.150 --> 01:00:09.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you've tried any of those,</v>

2048
01:00:09.441 --> 01:00:11.030
<v Speaker 1>like apple watch or anything like that.</v>

2049
01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:12.980
<v Speaker 1>I can't get into it.</v>

2050
01:00:13.010 --> 01:00:13.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2051
01:00:13.380 --> 01:00:14.320
<v Speaker 1>you get into that at all.</v>

2052
01:00:14.390 --> 01:00:15.560
<v Speaker 1>If I was given one,</v>

2053
01:00:15.561 --> 01:00:16.580
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be into it,</v>

2054
01:00:16.581 --> 01:00:17.414
<v Speaker 1>but I just can't.</v>

2055
01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:18.590
<v Speaker 1>It's too much money for me.</v>

2056
01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:19.311
<v Speaker 1>Oh well,</v>

2057
01:00:19.311 --> 01:00:20.390
<v Speaker 1>mine's cuts what it is.</v>

2058
01:00:21.530 --> 01:00:21.771
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2059
01:00:21.771 --> 01:00:25.820
<v Speaker 1>For a lot of people become much more days or the one I want is about $800.</v>

2060
01:00:25.821 --> 01:00:26.361
<v Speaker 1>$700.</v>

2061
01:00:26.361 --> 01:00:28.400
<v Speaker 1>Like the Middle One's stupid one.</v>

2062
01:00:28.401 --> 01:00:29.630
<v Speaker 1>That's like 25 grand.</v>

2063
01:00:29.631 --> 01:00:30.480
<v Speaker 1>That's like made a goal.</v>

2064
01:00:30.950 --> 01:00:32.570
<v Speaker 1>It's around 16,000,</v>

2065
01:00:32.571 --> 01:00:32.960
<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>

2066
01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:34.760
<v Speaker 1>What an asshole you would have to be by.</v>

2067
01:00:35.930 --> 01:00:40.930
<v Speaker 1>The weird thing about that too is you're going to sell a super luxury $16,000</v>

2068
01:00:41.511 --> 01:00:42.230
<v Speaker 1>watch.</v>

2069
01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:47.230
<v Speaker 1>Don't you want other people to know that it's a $16,000 because it looks exactly</v>

2070
01:00:47.421 --> 01:00:48.860
<v Speaker 1>like every other Apple Watch.</v>

2071
01:00:49.490 --> 01:00:49.941
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

2072
01:00:49.941 --> 01:00:53.810
<v Speaker 1>Like if so what is just the metal it's made out of has just made a gold.</v>

2073
01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:55.780
<v Speaker 1>But there's this,</v>

2074
01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:57.140
<v Speaker 1>there's a market for that shit.</v>

2075
01:00:57.380 --> 01:00:57.651
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2076
01:00:57.651 --> 01:00:58.061
<v Speaker 1>They sold it.</v>

2077
01:00:58.061 --> 01:01:00.230
<v Speaker 1>They sold out in China in the first 24 hours.</v>

2078
01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:01.040
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2079
01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:04.850
<v Speaker 1>there was an article recently that I read about Beverly Hills that there's an</v>

2080
01:01:04.851 --> 01:01:05.870
<v Speaker 1>insane amount.</v>

2081
01:01:05.900 --> 01:01:06.561
<v Speaker 1>Something like,</v>

2082
01:01:06.561 --> 01:01:11.561
<v Speaker 1>I think they were saying something will be 25 and 29 percent of all real estate</v>

2083
01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:17.200
<v Speaker 1>in Beverly Hills is being bought up by people from Saudi Arabia and Beverly</v>

2084
01:01:17.930 --> 01:01:19.620
<v Speaker 1>Hills and beverage in Beverly Hills.</v>

2085
01:01:19.740 --> 01:01:20.220
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2086
01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:20.661
<v Speaker 1>excuse me,</v>

2087
01:01:20.661 --> 01:01:21.620
<v Speaker 1>Saudi Arabia and China.</v>

2088
01:01:21.670 --> 01:01:21.800
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2089
01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:22.101
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

2090
01:01:22.101 --> 01:01:22.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2091
01:01:22.610 --> 01:01:27.610
<v Speaker 1>And that like literally that entire area has been purchased by foreign companies</v>

2092
01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:30.980
<v Speaker 1>or foreign countries.</v>

2093
01:01:31.030 --> 01:01:35.270
<v Speaker 1>These people that have ungodly amounts of money because of oil money.</v>

2094
01:01:35.690 --> 01:01:36.830
<v Speaker 1>So like we went to A.</v>

2095
01:01:36.831 --> 01:01:37.730
<v Speaker 1>I talked about this recently,</v>

2096
01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:41.420
<v Speaker 1>went to the steak place Beverly Hills and there was a guy that they're importing</v>

2097
01:01:41.421 --> 01:01:44.630
<v Speaker 1>cars from Saudi Arabia for the summer.</v>

2098
01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:45.410
<v Speaker 1>They call them,</v>

2099
01:01:45.410 --> 01:01:49.180
<v Speaker 1>they call it Saudi summer and they come down here because in the summer there</v>

2100
01:01:49.181 --> 01:01:50.630
<v Speaker 1>it's 150 fucking degrees.</v>

2101
01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:53.240
<v Speaker 1>They come down here and they drive.</v>

2102
01:01:53.241 --> 01:01:56.570
<v Speaker 1>They're unregistered cars around Beverly Hills.</v>

2103
01:01:56.571 --> 01:01:57.470
<v Speaker 1>These million dollar,</v>

2104
01:01:57.471 --> 01:01:58.161
<v Speaker 1>big Gaudy Va.</v>

2105
01:01:58.161 --> 01:01:58.910
<v Speaker 1>Ron's.</v>

2106
01:01:58.910 --> 01:02:01.850
<v Speaker 1>So they have these bugatti véRonique and all these fucking super million dollar</v>

2107
01:02:01.851 --> 01:02:06.851
<v Speaker 1>cars with saudi plates and one and I was with my friend who's from Iran and he,</v>

2108
01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:10.760
<v Speaker 1>he speaks a persian and farsi and he can,</v>

2109
01:02:10.820 --> 01:02:14.870
<v Speaker 1>he can read arabic and farsi is what they speak,</v>

2110
01:02:15.350 --> 01:02:15.920
<v Speaker 1>whatever I think.</v>

2111
01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:19.830
<v Speaker 1>So he can read arabic and he said it says palace on it.</v>

2112
01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:21.780
<v Speaker 1>It said palace in the license plate.</v>

2113
01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:22.890
<v Speaker 1>And it said to,</v>

2114
01:02:22.891 --> 01:02:23.221
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

2115
01:02:23.221 --> 01:02:23.730
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

2116
01:02:23.730 --> 01:02:24.001
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

2117
01:02:24.001 --> 01:02:24.271
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

2118
01:02:24.271 --> 01:02:26.190
<v Speaker 1>to like it was all twos.</v>

2119
01:02:26.490 --> 01:02:28.950
<v Speaker 1>So it's like the prince probably because they couldn't get one.</v>

2120
01:02:28.951 --> 01:02:29.091
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

2121
01:02:29.091 --> 01:02:29.301
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

2122
01:02:29.301 --> 01:02:29.471
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

2123
01:02:29.471 --> 01:02:29.591
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

2124
01:02:29.591 --> 01:02:30.630
<v Speaker 1>One says the king.</v>

2125
01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:30.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2126
01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:31.140
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2127
01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:31.530
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2128
01:02:31.530 --> 01:02:35.010
<v Speaker 1>Like this guy has fucking one point $5,000,000 car.</v>

2129
01:02:35.011 --> 01:02:36.810
<v Speaker 1>this isn't even registered in America.</v>

2130
01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:40.290
<v Speaker 1>And he's driving around and valet parking it in front of the steak place.</v>

2131
01:02:40.750 --> 01:02:41.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2132
01:02:41.070 --> 01:02:41.760
<v Speaker 1>this is a,</v>

2133
01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:44.490
<v Speaker 1>it's a strange coopting of this area,</v>

2134
01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:46.140
<v Speaker 1>But I like this because it's such,</v>

2135
01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:48.780
<v Speaker 1>it's such a like a name place.</v>

2136
01:02:49.350 --> 01:02:52.500
<v Speaker 1>There's a high value to that beverly hills name.</v>

2137
01:02:52.550 --> 01:02:52.980
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2138
01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:53.940
<v Speaker 1>So because of that,</v>

2139
01:02:53.970 --> 01:02:57.420
<v Speaker 1>like they said that some ungodly percentage of all homes,</v>

2140
01:02:57.421 --> 01:03:01.530
<v Speaker 1>over $10,000,000 are being purchased by rich people from Saudi Arabia and China.</v>

2141
01:03:01.700 --> 01:03:02.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2142
01:03:02.030 --> 01:03:04.050
<v Speaker 1>They just scooping them up and not even living in them.</v>

2143
01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:07.230
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a push to sort of,</v>

2144
01:03:07.290 --> 01:03:08.123
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2145
01:03:08.310 --> 01:03:13.200
<v Speaker 1>evacuate some of the money from those environments because there's an uneasiness</v>

2146
01:03:13.201 --> 01:03:16.380
<v Speaker 1>about what happens in the future and those economies.</v>

2147
01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:19.310
<v Speaker 1>So you get yourself diversified.</v>

2148
01:03:19.510 --> 01:03:20.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2149
01:03:20.340 --> 01:03:22.350
<v Speaker 1>But if we're getting lucrative,</v>

2150
01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:23.310
<v Speaker 1>you get lucrative.</v>

2151
01:03:23.550 --> 01:03:24.383
<v Speaker 1>People were tweeting,</v>

2152
01:03:24.660 --> 01:03:26.370
<v Speaker 1>were tweeting that to me today.</v>

2153
01:03:26.910 --> 01:03:30.150
<v Speaker 1>People were tweeting to me that this guy tweeted to me that he works at a</v>

2154
01:03:30.151 --> 01:03:31.380
<v Speaker 1>restaurant and then,</v>

2155
01:03:31.381 --> 01:03:31.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2156
01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:33.480
<v Speaker 1>all the people that work at that restaurant,</v>

2157
01:03:33.481 --> 01:03:33.991
<v Speaker 1>we yelling out,</v>

2158
01:03:33.991 --> 01:03:34.824
<v Speaker 1>let's get luke,</v>

2159
01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:35.940
<v Speaker 1>luke,</v>

2160
01:03:35.940 --> 01:03:36.420
<v Speaker 1>we begin.</v>

2161
01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:39.180
<v Speaker 1>I want to know where the tee shirt is because we need to make it.</v>

2162
01:03:39.181 --> 01:03:39.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2163
01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:41.420
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a few people that would pick that up.</v>

2164
01:03:41.421 --> 01:03:42.254
<v Speaker 1>Lucrative.</v>

2165
01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:46.710
<v Speaker 1>But yeah man,</v>

2166
01:03:46.710 --> 01:03:47.110
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2167
01:03:47.110 --> 01:03:51.930
<v Speaker 1>the money that would cost for that little $25,000 watch has nothing for those</v>

2168
01:03:51.931 --> 01:03:52.501
<v Speaker 1>kinds of people.</v>

2169
01:03:52.501 --> 01:03:54.480
<v Speaker 1>And that would be the instant thing they would want.</v>

2170
01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:56.610
<v Speaker 1>They would want that high end thing.</v>

2171
01:03:56.670 --> 01:03:57.630
<v Speaker 1>It's funny you talked about,</v>

2172
01:03:57.660 --> 01:03:59.160
<v Speaker 1>you talked about the license plates.</v>

2173
01:03:59.260 --> 01:04:01.110
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember where I watched this.</v>

2174
01:04:01.111 --> 01:04:04.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's a documentary or just a clip about the bidding that goes on</v>

2175
01:04:04.261 --> 01:04:09.261
<v Speaker 1>in dubai for the specific specialized license plates like exactly like you said,</v>

2176
01:04:09.601 --> 01:04:10.650
<v Speaker 1>the lower than number.</v>

2177
01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:15.920
<v Speaker 1>So having the car isn't prestigious enough because everybody's got one that's so</v>

2178
01:04:16.591 --> 01:04:20.400
<v Speaker 1>they'll fucking auctions for like license plate number one,</v>

2179
01:04:20.430 --> 01:04:21.120
<v Speaker 1>number two,</v>

2180
01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:21.960
<v Speaker 1>number three,</v>

2181
01:04:22.260 --> 01:04:23.220
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

2182
01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:23.581
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2183
01:04:23.581 --> 01:04:27.780
<v Speaker 1>it's in the millions of dollars because when you get to the like to the crazy</v>

2184
01:04:27.781 --> 01:04:30.060
<v Speaker 1>level of status and whatnot,</v>

2185
01:04:30.270 --> 01:04:32.430
<v Speaker 1>things get bonkers really quick,</v>

2186
01:04:32.940 --> 01:04:33.201
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2187
01:04:33.201 --> 01:04:33.821
<v Speaker 1>like as far as,</v>

2188
01:04:33.821 --> 01:04:34.654
<v Speaker 1>as far as what,</v>

2189
01:04:35.010 --> 01:04:36.030
<v Speaker 1>what you need to do,</v>

2190
01:04:36.070 --> 01:04:39.480
<v Speaker 1>how absurd things need to be for you to make a statement anymore.</v>

2191
01:04:40.230 --> 01:04:41.063
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

2192
01:04:41.130 --> 01:04:42.300
<v Speaker 1>well in that culture,</v>

2193
01:04:42.301 --> 01:04:46.040
<v Speaker 1>if that's what you're going for is only like the most obvious form of material,</v>

2194
01:04:46.070 --> 01:04:47.460
<v Speaker 1>like rampant materialism.</v>

2195
01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:48.090
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2196
01:04:48.090 --> 01:04:48.320
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2197
01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:48.960
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

2198
01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:50.160
<v Speaker 1>if that's what you're going for.</v>

2199
01:04:50.190 --> 01:04:50.461
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2200
01:04:50.461 --> 01:04:51.181
<v Speaker 1>that's what you want.</v>

2201
01:04:51.181 --> 01:04:53.510
<v Speaker 1>You want to get like the number one license plate.</v>

2202
01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:54.540
<v Speaker 1>Get him.</v>

2203
01:04:54.540 --> 01:04:55.450
<v Speaker 1>He's got a boot guy.</v>

2204
01:04:55.820 --> 01:04:57.690
<v Speaker 1>He has a $5,000,000 license plate.</v>

2205
01:04:57.691 --> 01:04:58.500
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

2206
01:04:58.500 --> 01:04:59.370
<v Speaker 1>That's so stupid.</v>

2207
01:05:00.410 --> 01:05:00.950
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

2208
01:05:00.950 --> 01:05:02.480
<v Speaker 1>Well we're act.</v>

2209
01:05:02.490 --> 01:05:04.290
<v Speaker 1>What if you have that much money?</v>

2210
01:05:04.291 --> 01:05:05.100
<v Speaker 1>Is it though?</v>

2211
01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:05.933
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>

2212
01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:08.190
<v Speaker 1>You have more money than you could ever spent,</v>

2213
01:05:08.250 --> 01:05:08.401
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2214
01:05:08.401 --> 01:05:10.020
<v Speaker 1>But why would you want that license plate?</v>

2215
01:05:10.950 --> 01:05:11.783
<v Speaker 1>That's a good point.</v>

2216
01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:12.661
<v Speaker 1>That much money.</v>

2217
01:05:12.661 --> 01:05:14.280
<v Speaker 1>And you're still trying that hard.</v>

2218
01:05:14.281 --> 01:05:16.230
<v Speaker 1>What kind of an environment are you competing in?</v>

2219
01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:19.530
<v Speaker 1>What kind of you trying to conjure up to bring into your life?</v>

2220
01:05:19.531 --> 01:05:20.320
<v Speaker 1>Skip point.</v>

2221
01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:20.560
<v Speaker 1>Who?</v>

2222
01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:20.800
<v Speaker 1>The.</v>

2223
01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:22.090
<v Speaker 1>Who are you trying to impress?</v>

2224
01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:22.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2225
01:05:22.580 --> 01:05:24.110
<v Speaker 1>You already have a fucking giant yacht.</v>

2226
01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:25.570
<v Speaker 1>You have a giant fucking house.</v>

2227
01:05:25.780 --> 01:05:27.550
<v Speaker 1>You have a one point $7,000,000 car.</v>

2228
01:05:27.551 --> 01:05:29.760
<v Speaker 1>Does anybody look at your license plate and go look at doula?</v>

2229
01:05:29.770 --> 01:05:31.690
<v Speaker 1>That regular fucking license plate.</v>

2230
01:05:32.170 --> 01:05:33.970
<v Speaker 1>You can even afford the license plate.</v>

2231
01:05:34.530 --> 01:05:34.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2232
01:05:34.780 --> 01:05:35.613
<v Speaker 1>You're not in the club.</v>

2233
01:05:35.770 --> 01:05:36.011
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2234
01:05:36.011 --> 01:05:36.970
<v Speaker 1>That's not allowed in.</v>

2235
01:05:37.110 --> 01:05:37.341
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

2236
01:05:37.341 --> 01:05:39.910
<v Speaker 1>I think it's more a thing of like in,</v>

2237
01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:42.640
<v Speaker 1>in order to maintain your competitiveness,</v>

2238
01:05:42.641 --> 01:05:46.000
<v Speaker 1>you have to keep on approaching these things.</v>

2239
01:05:46.001 --> 01:05:49.060
<v Speaker 1>That shouldn't be attainable like anybody working in anything.</v>

2240
01:05:49.570 --> 01:05:49.901
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2241
01:05:49.901 --> 01:05:50.441
<v Speaker 1>But I think.</v>

2242
01:05:50.441 --> 01:05:53.500
<v Speaker 1>I think that you have to put these challenges in front of yourself,</v>

2243
01:05:53.501 --> 01:05:56.620
<v Speaker 1>like I got to get the extra million for the right license plate.</v>

2244
01:05:56.621 --> 01:05:58.000
<v Speaker 1>That's just a weird,</v>

2245
01:05:58.330 --> 01:06:00.490
<v Speaker 1>a weirdo version of that,</v>

2246
01:06:00.491 --> 01:06:01.030
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

2247
01:06:01.030 --> 01:06:01.421
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

2248
01:06:01.421 --> 01:06:05.590
<v Speaker 1>It's all weirdo versions because like labels are critical.</v>

2249
01:06:05.890 --> 01:06:08.800
<v Speaker 1>Like people want labels like very,</v>

2250
01:06:09.010 --> 01:06:12.160
<v Speaker 1>like someone was making fun of me because I have a lexus.</v>

2251
01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:14.650
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to drive an alexis for?</v>

2252
01:06:14.651 --> 01:06:16.570
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you have a mercedes or bmw or something like that.</v>

2253
01:06:16.571 --> 01:06:16.751
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2254
01:06:16.751 --> 01:06:17.650
<v Speaker 1>this is a great car.</v>

2255
01:06:18.220 --> 01:06:19.480
<v Speaker 1>What's wrong with you?</v>

2256
01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:22.210
<v Speaker 1>It's like nobody's impressed by alexis.</v>

2257
01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:22.541
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2258
01:06:22.541 --> 01:06:22.990

2263
01:06:28.810 --> 01:06:29.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2264
01:06:29.490 --> 01:06:30.970
<v Speaker 1>what is wrong with people that,</v>

2265
01:06:30.971 --> 01:06:32.530
<v Speaker 1>that becomes a giant issue.</v>

2266
01:06:32.950 --> 01:06:33.783
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2267
01:06:34.450 --> 01:06:35.283
<v Speaker 1>Branding,</v>

2268
01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:36.010
<v Speaker 1>branding,</v>

2269
01:06:36.010 --> 01:06:36.431
<v Speaker 1>branding.</v>

2270
01:06:36.431 --> 01:06:37.300
<v Speaker 1>It's strange.</v>

2271
01:06:37.301 --> 01:06:37.960
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

2272
01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:39.640
<v Speaker 1>Because I was in one of those.</v>

2273
01:06:39.641 --> 01:06:40.474
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2274
01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:41.433
<v Speaker 1>what are they called?</v>

2275
01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:42.460
<v Speaker 1>The whatever.</v>

2276
01:06:42.461 --> 01:06:43.420
<v Speaker 1>The fucking high end.</v>

2277
01:06:43.421 --> 01:06:45.700
<v Speaker 1>Hyundai is now a genesis.</v>

2278
01:06:46.170 --> 01:06:46.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2279
01:06:46.660 --> 01:06:47.950
<v Speaker 1>I was in one of those and I was like,</v>

2280
01:06:47.951 --> 01:06:50.160
<v Speaker 1>this is a fucking great car.</v>

2281
01:06:50.350 --> 01:06:52.090
<v Speaker 1>It feels like a mercedes in here,</v>

2282
01:06:52.270 --> 01:06:53.920
<v Speaker 1>but I wouldn't drive it because it's a hyundai.</v>

2283
01:06:53.980 --> 01:06:54.580
<v Speaker 1>Yep,</v>

2284
01:06:54.580 --> 01:06:55.480
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking that.</v>

2285
01:06:55.540 --> 01:06:56.370
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking like,</v>

2286
01:06:56.370 --> 01:06:57.560
<v Speaker 1>what would I draw?</v>

2287
01:06:57.590 --> 01:06:59.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean I probably would,</v>

2288
01:06:59.111 --> 01:07:00.390
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>

2289
01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:02.780
<v Speaker 1>Sunday is like a v,</v>

2290
01:07:02.790 --> 01:07:05.200
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to get excited about that.</v>

2291
01:07:05.470 --> 01:07:08.230
<v Speaker 1>Whereas at least lexus is like higher end than that.</v>

2292
01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:08.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2293
01:07:08.570 --> 01:07:08.951
<v Speaker 1>Know what I mean?</v>

2294
01:07:08.951 --> 01:07:09.131
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2295
01:07:09.131 --> 01:07:12.070
<v Speaker 1>so I'm guilty of the thing I'm mocking.</v>

2296
01:07:12.071 --> 01:07:12.460
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

2297
01:07:12.460 --> 01:07:13.480
<v Speaker 1>I think everybody is.</v>

2298
01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:14.290
<v Speaker 1>I think we,</v>

2299
01:07:14.290 --> 01:07:17.080
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a way I've said this before,</v>

2300
01:07:17.170 --> 01:07:18.840
<v Speaker 1>I think that the,</v>

2301
01:07:18.890 --> 01:07:19.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2302
01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:21.580
<v Speaker 1>a person who has a certain,</v>

2303
01:07:22.030 --> 01:07:22.391
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2304
01:07:22.391 --> 01:07:26.890
<v Speaker 1>certain access to a particular way of life that the shortcut,</v>

2305
01:07:27.550 --> 01:07:29.710
<v Speaker 1>the rich guys shortcut to buying,</v>

2306
01:07:30.310 --> 01:07:33.160
<v Speaker 1>to buying the right thing is to buy an expensive one.</v>

2307
01:07:33.370 --> 01:07:33.730
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2308
01:07:33.730 --> 01:07:34.840
<v Speaker 1>You walk into a store,</v>

2309
01:07:35.050 --> 01:07:36.100
<v Speaker 1>they've got a bunch of shirts.</v>

2310
01:07:36.101 --> 01:07:37.120
<v Speaker 1>Which one should I have?</v>

2311
01:07:37.690 --> 01:07:38.320
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2312
01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:41.950
<v Speaker 1>I can bypass the whole research structure by just buying the best,</v>

2313
01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:42.661
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2314
01:07:42.661 --> 01:07:45.040
<v Speaker 1>like the average person when they're going to purchase a car,</v>

2315
01:07:45.310 --> 01:07:46.143
<v Speaker 1>they spend,</v>

2316
01:07:46.420 --> 01:07:48.730
<v Speaker 1>I think I heard this stat recently,</v>

2317
01:07:48.731 --> 01:07:53.530
<v Speaker 1>it's about 52 days from when they get the idea that they need a new car to the</v>

2318
01:07:53.531 --> 01:07:55.660
<v Speaker 1>point at which they make the purchase researching.</v>

2319
01:07:55.930 --> 01:07:57.280
<v Speaker 1>There's various stages throughout.</v>

2320
01:07:57.281 --> 01:07:58.480
<v Speaker 1>It's actually getting shorter though,</v>

2321
01:07:58.481 --> 01:07:59.620
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of strange.</v>

2322
01:08:00.070 --> 01:08:01.390
<v Speaker 1>I think the internet is getting better,</v>

2323
01:08:01.391 --> 01:08:02.224
<v Speaker 1>to be honest with you.</v>

2324
01:08:02.350 --> 01:08:06.690
<v Speaker 1>I will youtube videos on reviews of cars are awesome.</v>

2325
01:08:06.691 --> 01:08:07.960
<v Speaker 1>They're so critical.</v>

2326
01:08:07.961 --> 01:08:08.261
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2327
01:08:08.261 --> 01:08:10.960
<v Speaker 1>And so I think that's really expediting the process,</v>

2328
01:08:10.961 --> 01:08:11.794
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

2329
01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:12.761
<v Speaker 1>but anyway,</v>

2330
01:08:12.761 --> 01:08:13.061
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2331
01:08:13.061 --> 01:08:15.190
<v Speaker 1>I think that generally speaking,</v>

2332
01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:20.200
<v Speaker 1>those who have an abundance of wealth don't have as much time usually as usually</v>

2333
01:08:20.601 --> 01:08:21.051
<v Speaker 1>the way it works.</v>

2334
01:08:21.051 --> 01:08:26.051
<v Speaker 1>So you kind of try to bypass that whole process by buying the best thing and</v>

2335
01:08:26.121 --> 01:08:27.230
<v Speaker 1>that's where brands come in.</v>

2336
01:08:27.231 --> 01:08:31.880
<v Speaker 1>Brands almost help you in a way have you sort of through their prestige and</v>

2337
01:08:31.881 --> 01:08:36.380
<v Speaker 1>their established symbol that I know if I get that I'm good and I don't need to</v>

2338
01:08:36.381 --> 01:08:37.610
<v Speaker 1>ask anybody about that.</v>

2339
01:08:37.611 --> 01:08:38.121
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to,</v>

2340
01:08:38.121 --> 01:08:38.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2341
01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:40.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to pull my friends or whatever.</v>

2342
01:08:40.190 --> 01:08:40.970
<v Speaker 1>It's like a,</v>

2343
01:08:40.970 --> 01:08:41.751
<v Speaker 1>it's like a hack.</v>

2344
01:08:41.751 --> 01:08:43.310
<v Speaker 1>It's the quickest way towards that.</v>

2345
01:08:43.311 --> 01:08:44.330
<v Speaker 1>It's like a fancy,</v>

2346
01:08:44.670 --> 01:08:44.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2347
01:08:44.810 --> 01:08:46.220
<v Speaker 1>fancy liquor or uh,</v>

2348
01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:46.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2349
01:08:46.940 --> 01:08:48.880
<v Speaker 1>the right cigar or in,</v>

2350
01:08:48.881 --> 01:08:49.371
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

2351
01:08:49.371 --> 01:08:53.660
<v Speaker 1>It's like you can find an example of that in almost every product category.</v>

2352
01:08:53.780 --> 01:08:57.530
<v Speaker 1>It's the same reason why samsung is samsung now.</v>

2353
01:08:57.560 --> 01:09:01.640
<v Speaker 1>It took so much time in so much money for that to be an acceptable brand.</v>

2354
01:09:02.460 --> 01:09:04.610
<v Speaker 1>They make weapons to probably.</v>

2355
01:09:04.670 --> 01:09:05.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure they make weapons,</v>

2356
01:09:05.750 --> 01:09:06.583
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

2357
01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:08.390
<v Speaker 1>I think in Korea they make everything,</v>

2358
01:09:08.391 --> 01:09:11.480
<v Speaker 1>but I'm pretty sure samsung makes missiles or some shit.</v>

2359
01:09:11.510 --> 01:09:13.070
<v Speaker 1>Let's say samsung makes weapons.</v>

2360
01:09:13.071 --> 01:09:13.904
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>

2361
01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:15.620
<v Speaker 1>You know you're probably.</v>

2362
01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:16.700
<v Speaker 1>You're probably right.</v>

2363
01:09:16.701 --> 01:09:17.480
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

2364
01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:17.751
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

2365
01:09:17.751 --> 01:09:20.750
<v Speaker 1>They make all kinds of things in Korea that never make it here.</v>

2366
01:09:20.780 --> 01:09:24.680
<v Speaker 1>Samsung also makes weapons checkout all they do.</v>

2367
01:09:24.710 --> 01:09:25.491
<v Speaker 1>Jesus christ,</v>

2368
01:09:25.491 --> 01:09:26.630
<v Speaker 1>they make fucking tanks.</v>

2369
01:09:27.370 --> 01:09:27.591
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2370
01:09:27.591 --> 01:09:28.424
<v Speaker 1>Vehicles.</v>

2371
01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:30.110
<v Speaker 1>Samsung tech,</v>

2372
01:09:30.170 --> 01:09:35.170
<v Speaker 1>low tech tech when surveillance area narcotics.</v>

2373
01:09:36.350 --> 01:09:37.760
<v Speaker 1>This is fascinating.</v>

2374
01:09:38.090 --> 01:09:40.310
<v Speaker 1>Op doe electronics.</v>

2375
01:09:40.311 --> 01:09:41.144
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what that is.</v>

2376
01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:43.850
<v Speaker 1>Automations and weapons technology company.</v>

2377
01:09:43.851 --> 01:09:45.590
<v Speaker 1>It's a subsidiary of samsung group,</v>

2378
01:09:46.340 --> 01:09:46.790
<v Speaker 1>huh?</v>

2379
01:09:46.790 --> 01:09:47.031

2384
01:09:55.180 --> 01:09:55.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2385
01:09:55.310 --> 01:09:59.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean those big technology companies got to diversify your portfolio.</v>

2386
01:09:59.870 --> 01:10:00.470
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2387
01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:01.110
<v Speaker 1>Get lucrative.</v>

2388
01:10:01.110 --> 01:10:01.943
<v Speaker 1>Got to get loose.</v>

2389
01:10:02.350 --> 01:10:03.530
<v Speaker 1>That's the best way to get lucrative.</v>

2390
01:10:03.531 --> 01:10:04.101
<v Speaker 1>Make weapons.</v>

2391
01:10:04.101 --> 01:10:05.110
<v Speaker 1>People are always looking at clothes.</v>

2392
01:10:05.190 --> 01:10:05.970
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

2393
01:10:05.970 --> 01:10:07.500
<v Speaker 1>It's always someone,</v>

2394
01:10:07.870 --> 01:10:08.780
<v Speaker 1>some part of the world.</v>

2395
01:10:08.781 --> 01:10:11.330
<v Speaker 1>It's like if I just had something that could blow these motherfuckers up over</v>

2396
01:10:11.331 --> 01:10:11.860
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

2397
01:10:11.860 --> 01:10:15.260
<v Speaker 1>it'd be all good that that was the real game changer when it came to war.</v>

2398
01:10:15.261 --> 01:10:15.800
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2399
01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:18.110
<v Speaker 1>Once I get to start blowing shit up and they weren't anywhere near it.</v>

2400
01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:19.273
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2401
01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:22.630
<v Speaker 1>When london started getting bombed during the world war ii,</v>

2402
01:10:23.450 --> 01:10:27.740
<v Speaker 1>even world war one when they started launching bombs and using chemical gas and</v>

2403
01:10:27.940 --> 01:10:31.580
<v Speaker 1>essentially killing people at a long distance without having to see them.</v>

2404
01:10:31.620 --> 01:10:31.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2405
01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:32.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2406
01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:34.520
<v Speaker 1>And now we're even further past that.</v>

2407
01:10:34.550 --> 01:10:36.020
<v Speaker 1>Like really game controller in a.</v>

2408
01:10:36.170 --> 01:10:36.351
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2409
01:10:36.351 --> 01:10:37.310
<v Speaker 1>Well that's why I wanted to bring that up.</v>

2410
01:10:37.311 --> 01:10:38.630
<v Speaker 1>Like the drones,</v>

2411
01:10:38.750 --> 01:10:40.550
<v Speaker 1>like now they're having drones.</v>

2412
01:10:40.580 --> 01:10:44.090
<v Speaker 1>Did you see that one guy that stitched together all those drones with some sort</v>

2413
01:10:44.091 --> 01:10:44.924
<v Speaker 1>of software?</v>

2414
01:10:45.780 --> 01:10:46.470
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2415
01:10:46.470 --> 01:10:47.230
<v Speaker 1>I saw that.</v>

2416
01:10:47.230 --> 01:10:49.880
<v Speaker 1>Like that guy's kind of bypassing all the area.</v>

2417
01:10:49.881 --> 01:10:52.490
<v Speaker 1>Not as rules because those rules,</v>

2418
01:10:52.491 --> 01:10:54.380
<v Speaker 1>like if you want to get a helicopter,</v>

2419
01:10:54.381 --> 01:10:56.330
<v Speaker 1>you have to get a helicopter license.</v>

2420
01:10:56.331 --> 01:10:57.164
<v Speaker 1>You have to,</v>

2421
01:10:57.260 --> 01:10:57.501
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2422
01:10:57.501 --> 01:10:57.790
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>

2423
01:10:57.790 --> 01:10:59.510
<v Speaker 1>You have to tell people where you're flying.</v>

2424
01:10:59.570 --> 01:10:59.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2425
01:10:59.810 --> 01:11:00.230
<v Speaker 1>we're at a,</v>

2426
01:11:00.230 --> 01:11:04.400
<v Speaker 1>we're in a strange point right now where technology is progressing at this</v>

2427
01:11:04.790 --> 01:11:08.570
<v Speaker 1>insane speed and the legal system doesn't,</v>

2428
01:11:09.110 --> 01:11:10.370
<v Speaker 1>takes way longer than that.</v>

2429
01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:14.340
<v Speaker 1>There's not enough time to go through all the steps necessary</v>

2430
01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:18.000
<v Speaker 2>on that side of it to catch up with the technology as it's happening.</v>

2431
01:11:18.001 --> 01:11:18.600
<v Speaker 2>Drones,</v>

2432
01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:21.150
<v Speaker 2>what was that story the other day where there were all those drones up in the</v>

2433
01:11:21.151 --> 01:11:21.990
<v Speaker 2>air and they couldn't,</v>

2434
01:11:22.470 --> 01:11:26.010
<v Speaker 2>so the helicopters couldn't get to a scene where someone needed to be airlifted.</v>

2435
01:11:26.100 --> 01:11:26.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2436
01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:27.151
<v Speaker 2>they're here,</v>

2437
01:11:27.151 --> 01:11:27.480
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2438
01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:27.661
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2439
01:11:27.661 --> 01:11:28.370
<v Speaker 2>They were using.</v>

2440
01:11:28.370 --> 01:11:32.520
<v Speaker 2>People were using video drones to take videos of something that was going on.</v>

2441
01:11:32.550 --> 01:11:33.001
<v Speaker 2>What was that?</v>

2442
01:11:33.001 --> 01:11:33.860
<v Speaker 2>An accident or something?</v>

2443
01:11:34.030 --> 01:11:35.880
<v Speaker 2>I think it was an accident in a helicopter.</v>

2444
01:11:35.881 --> 01:11:38.790
<v Speaker 2>Needed to get in there to pull the person out and they couldn't because of the</v>

2445
01:11:38.791 --> 01:11:40.350
<v Speaker 2>drums and they couldn't because of the drunk.</v>

2446
01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:40.771
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2447
01:11:40.771 --> 01:11:42.750
<v Speaker 2>well they're going to have to have drone blockers.</v>

2448
01:11:42.751 --> 01:11:45.450
<v Speaker 2>The way movie theaters should have cell phone blocker,</v>

2449
01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:46.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2450
01:11:46.140 --> 01:11:48.810
<v Speaker 2>like people are on their fucking phones and movie theaters all the time.</v>

2451
01:11:48.940 --> 01:11:49.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2452
01:11:49.650 --> 01:11:50.880
<v Speaker 2>One of the most annoying things ever.</v>

2453
01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:51.001
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2454
01:11:51.001 --> 01:11:54.300
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have that those block or know how you do it because.</v>

2455
01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:54.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2456
01:11:54.870 --> 01:11:56.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean because it's a.</v>

2457
01:11:56.330 --> 01:11:57.540
<v Speaker 2>It's a radio frequency,</v>

2458
01:11:57.541 --> 01:11:57.781
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2459
01:11:57.781 --> 01:11:57.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2460
01:11:57.990 --> 01:11:58.390
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

2461
01:11:58.390 --> 01:11:58.570
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2462
01:11:58.570 --> 01:12:00.150
<v Speaker 2>it's a rf from your.</v>

2463
01:12:00.690 --> 01:12:03.630
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be seeking to destroy type joint trends that you just like</v>

2464
01:12:03.631 --> 01:12:06.330
<v Speaker 2>throw in the air and they just go after these drones and somehow knock them out</v>

2465
01:12:06.331 --> 01:12:07.050
<v Speaker 2>of commission,</v>

2466
01:12:07.050 --> 01:12:10.090
<v Speaker 2>but you like aerial warfare over the freeway.</v>

2467
01:12:10.580 --> 01:12:11.800
<v Speaker 2>Drop on little kids' head.</v>

2468
01:12:12.510 --> 01:12:16.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm a baby gets killed by a falling drone that was taken out by a company.</v>

2469
01:12:16.350 --> 01:12:16.800
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2470
01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:20.370
<v Speaker 2>I was on the beach the other day just hanging out and it was a pretty empty</v>

2471
01:12:20.371 --> 01:12:22.820
<v Speaker 2>beach in santa barbara and I just heard this like,</v>

2472
01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:24.273
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2473
01:12:24.300 --> 01:12:25.230
<v Speaker 2>what is that noise?</v>

2474
01:12:25.231 --> 01:12:28.650
<v Speaker 2>I look up and there's just a drone sitting there right above me.</v>

2475
01:12:28.651 --> 01:12:29.100
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2476
01:12:29.100 --> 01:12:29.491
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

2477
01:12:29.491 --> 01:12:30.281
<v Speaker 2>super high up,</v>

2478
01:12:30.281 --> 01:12:31.560
<v Speaker 2>but you can almost barely see it.</v>

2479
01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:34.170
<v Speaker 2>And then it just flew away and I looked around.</v>

2480
01:12:34.171 --> 01:12:36.090
<v Speaker 2>I didn't see anybody growing up far.</v>

2481
01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:36.511
<v Speaker 2>Can they go?</v>

2482
01:12:36.511 --> 01:12:37.344
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2483
01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:38.251
<v Speaker 2>like a mile,</v>

2484
01:12:38.251 --> 01:12:38.520
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2485
01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:39.270
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

2486
01:12:39.270 --> 01:12:44.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think it probably depends on like a military ones or do like a</v>

2487
01:12:44.191 --> 01:12:44.610
<v Speaker 2>personal,</v>

2488
01:12:44.610 --> 01:12:45.443
<v Speaker 2>not personal,</v>

2489
01:12:45.460 --> 01:12:49.030
<v Speaker 2>no personal one I think is still relatively line of sight like it.</v>

2490
01:12:49.031 --> 01:12:49.670
<v Speaker 2>You have to,</v>

2491
01:12:49.670 --> 01:12:52.470
<v Speaker 2>I think the minute you can't make it out is probably out of range.</v>

2492
01:12:52.471 --> 01:12:53.910
<v Speaker 2>Just falls out of the sky.</v>

2493
01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:56.280
<v Speaker 2>That's the craziest part of the drone.</v>

2494
01:12:56.281 --> 01:12:58.320
<v Speaker 2>People are going to get really upset with us right now,</v>

2495
01:12:58.321 --> 01:12:59.850
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know what the fuck we're talking about.</v>

2496
01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:01.200
<v Speaker 2>Not just that,</v>

2497
01:13:01.201 --> 01:13:06.201
<v Speaker 2>but it's a very sensitive subject matter because these enthusiasts are super</v>

2498
01:13:06.601 --> 01:13:07.021
<v Speaker 2>into it.</v>

2499
01:13:07.021 --> 01:13:10.590
<v Speaker 2>Like a lot of people in guys like us come and we talk about only the shitty part</v>

2500
01:13:10.591 --> 01:13:10.831
<v Speaker 2>of it,</v>

2501
01:13:10.831 --> 01:13:14.160
<v Speaker 2>like them falling out of the sky and killing people and they think that's going</v>

2502
01:13:14.161 --> 01:13:15.540
<v Speaker 2>to influence government,</v>

2503
01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:18.990
<v Speaker 2>which will then take away their freedom to do that thing just like everything</v>

2504
01:13:18.991 --> 01:13:19.290
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>

2505
01:13:19.290 --> 01:13:19.640
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2506
01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:22.560
<v Speaker 2>But people that love doing something and they want to protect that freedom.</v>

2507
01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:23.790
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2508
01:13:23.790 --> 01:13:24.980
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

2509
01:13:24.981 --> 01:13:25.440
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

2510
01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:26.011
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

2511
01:13:26.011 --> 01:13:28.950
<v Speaker 2>I've done videos on these little toy drones.</v>

2512
01:13:28.951 --> 01:13:30.120
<v Speaker 2>They're there nothing to,</v>

2513
01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:30.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2514
01:13:30.810 --> 01:13:33.060
<v Speaker 2>you fly them indoors or whatever.</v>

2515
01:13:33.540 --> 01:13:37.830
<v Speaker 2>And if you get any of the terminology wrong or you talk about them being</v>

2516
01:13:37.831 --> 01:13:39.690
<v Speaker 2>dangerous in any way or anything like that,</v>

2517
01:13:39.691 --> 01:13:44.460
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have an entire script in your comments actually in about like</v>

2518
01:13:44.490 --> 01:13:44.880
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2519
01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:46.440
<v Speaker 2>You're fucking it up for us.</v>

2520
01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:46.951
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

2521
01:13:46.951 --> 01:13:47.311
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2522
01:13:47.311 --> 01:13:47.540
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2523
01:13:47.540 --> 01:13:47.780
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2524
01:13:47.780 --> 01:13:49.710
<v Speaker 2>you're influencing the public opinion.</v>

2525
01:13:49.711 --> 01:13:51.320
<v Speaker 2>You should know what you're talking about before,</v>

2526
01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:52.170
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2527
01:13:52.170 --> 01:13:52.710
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2528
01:13:52.710 --> 01:13:53.220
<v Speaker 2>they do.</v>

2529
01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:54.090
<v Speaker 2>They do have a point,</v>

2530
01:13:54.091 --> 01:13:58.980
<v Speaker 2>but so does the public at large and seeing a flying thing above their head and</v>

2531
01:13:58.981 --> 01:14:03.840
<v Speaker 2>wondering if the connection between the thing controlling it and it itself is</v>

2532
01:14:04.230 --> 01:14:06.120
<v Speaker 2>stable enough to keep it up there.</v>

2533
01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:06.391
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2534
01:14:06.391 --> 01:14:07.051
<v Speaker 2>not only that,</v>

2535
01:14:07.051 --> 01:14:07.441
<v Speaker 2>how about the,</v>

2536
01:14:07.441 --> 01:14:08.850
<v Speaker 2>just the privacy intrusion.</v>

2537
01:14:08.851 --> 01:14:11.100
<v Speaker 2>If you're some person who's sunbathing some woman,</v>

2538
01:14:11.250 --> 01:14:11.680
<v Speaker 2>oh right,</v>

2539
01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:12.040
<v Speaker 2>you have</v>

2540
01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:12.940
<v Speaker 1>a fence.</v>

2541
01:14:12.941 --> 01:14:15.520
<v Speaker 1>You like to sunbathe naked because you're in a private,</v>

2542
01:14:15.670 --> 01:14:19.090
<v Speaker 1>you know you're in the backyard and no one can see in and you want to take your</v>

2543
01:14:19.091 --> 01:14:21.280
<v Speaker 1>top off and then get your tits tanned.</v>

2544
01:14:21.790 --> 01:14:22.690
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that anymore.</v>

2545
01:14:22.691 --> 01:14:26.260
<v Speaker 1>Who does almost four k video on your tits now on in there.</v>

2546
01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:27.370
<v Speaker 1>And zoom in on it.</v>

2547
01:14:27.790 --> 01:14:32.790
<v Speaker 1>And then also the oculus rift effect because when I was on that a scifi show,</v>

2548
01:14:33.401 --> 01:14:36.970
<v Speaker 1>we did some things where we took drones and we strapped cameras to these drones</v>

2549
01:14:37.270 --> 01:14:42.100
<v Speaker 1>and we flew over the top of these trees in the pacific northwest.</v>

2550
01:14:42.270 --> 01:14:44.110
<v Speaker 1>There was like looking for bigfoot episode,</v>

2551
01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:47.350
<v Speaker 1>were flying around looking for bigfoot with a fucking drunk.</v>

2552
01:14:47.380 --> 01:14:49.900
<v Speaker 1>Now obviously more of a goof than anything,</v>

2553
01:14:50.460 --> 01:14:52.750
<v Speaker 1>but the goggles were fucking crazy.</v>

2554
01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:55.420
<v Speaker 1>So you were seeing it's vision through vr yet?</v>

2555
01:14:55.450 --> 01:14:55.601
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2556
01:14:55.601 --> 01:14:56.530
<v Speaker 1>So I'm watch.</v>

2557
01:14:56.531 --> 01:15:01.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm literally feels like I'm flying because my field of vision is just like the</v>

2558
01:15:01.361 --> 01:15:02.500
<v Speaker 1>vr field division.</v>

2559
01:15:02.860 --> 01:15:06.550
<v Speaker 1>And you're super wide angle to the camera that's attached to this drone.</v>

2560
01:15:06.990 --> 01:15:07.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2561
01:15:07.330 --> 01:15:07.900
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>

2562
01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:08.231
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2563
01:15:08.231 --> 01:15:08.651
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

2564
01:15:08.651 --> 01:15:09.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's going to get real,</v>

2565
01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.320
<v Speaker 1>real strange.</v>

2566
01:15:11.321 --> 01:15:12.160
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

2567
01:15:12.161 --> 01:15:12.880
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>

2568
01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:16.630
<v Speaker 1>the regulations have not caught up to the technology and technology's gonna move</v>

2569
01:15:16.631 --> 01:15:19.150
<v Speaker 1>way faster than these dummies that are making these,</v>

2570
01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:20.040
<v Speaker 1>these registry,</v>

2571
01:15:20.210 --> 01:15:21.490
<v Speaker 1>the regulations in the first place.</v>

2572
01:15:21.491 --> 01:15:22.930
<v Speaker 1>They don't really know what's going on.</v>

2573
01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:23.350
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2574
01:15:23.350 --> 01:15:24.183
<v Speaker 1>and how do you,</v>

2575
01:15:24.190 --> 01:15:24.491
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

2576
01:15:24.491 --> 01:15:28.360
<v Speaker 1>how do you get a person to get to be interested in getting into government to</v>

2577
01:15:28.361 --> 01:15:29.830
<v Speaker 1>write these regulations?</v>

2578
01:15:30.220 --> 01:15:32.680
<v Speaker 1>Who's actually familiar with the thing,</v>

2579
01:15:32.681 --> 01:15:35.420
<v Speaker 1>like why in god's name would they want to do this at that point?</v>

2580
01:15:35.421 --> 01:15:36.670
<v Speaker 1>And they have to get elected.</v>

2581
01:15:36.671 --> 01:15:37.460
<v Speaker 1>They have to.</v>

2582
01:15:37.460 --> 01:15:41.380
<v Speaker 1>It's a whole process of getting intelligent people into the spot they should be</v>

2583
01:15:41.381 --> 01:15:41.740
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

2584
01:15:41.740 --> 01:15:43.540
<v Speaker 1>is too slow,</v>

2585
01:15:43.541 --> 01:15:46.630
<v Speaker 1>too convoluted and the world is changing too quickly.</v>

2586
01:15:46.660 --> 01:15:49.870
<v Speaker 1>So the people who make the laws would have to rely on experts like they have to</v>

2587
01:15:49.871 --> 01:15:50.800
<v Speaker 1>hire people,</v>

2588
01:15:50.860 --> 01:15:52.270
<v Speaker 1>except who are those experts?</v>

2589
01:15:52.860 --> 01:15:53.080
<v Speaker 1>Water,</v>

2590
01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:54.100
<v Speaker 1>their agenda,</v>

2591
01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:55.240
<v Speaker 1>what's their credentials?</v>

2592
01:15:55.241 --> 01:15:59.650
<v Speaker 1>And essentially this young kids that haven't even graduated from high school yet</v>

2593
01:15:59.900 --> 01:16:03.640
<v Speaker 1>that know as much or more than anyone these people going to hire in the first</v>

2594
01:16:03.641 --> 01:16:03.880
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

2595
01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:04.301
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2596
01:16:04.301 --> 01:16:07.000
<v Speaker 1>Like these comments that you're getting these detailed comments crittenton you</v>

2597
01:16:07.300 --> 01:16:10.630
<v Speaker 1>think it might be from like that 14 year old kid in fucking dallas.</v>

2598
01:16:10.631 --> 01:16:12.550
<v Speaker 1>They got arrested today because,</v>

2599
01:16:12.551 --> 01:16:12.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2600
01:16:12.850 --> 01:16:15.200
<v Speaker 1>his teacher thought he was making a bomb because he made,</v>

2601
01:16:15.340 --> 01:16:16.810
<v Speaker 1>made a homemade clock.</v>

2602
01:16:17.350 --> 01:16:17.591
<v Speaker 1>And.</v>

2603
01:16:17.591 --> 01:16:21.070
<v Speaker 1>But he happened to be making an inventing things while brown,</v>

2604
01:16:21.460 --> 01:16:23.020
<v Speaker 1>and that's very dangerous,</v>

2605
01:16:23.740 --> 01:16:25.500
<v Speaker 1>especially with an arab last name,</v>

2606
01:16:25.501 --> 01:16:26.590
<v Speaker 1>and especially in Texas.</v>

2607
01:16:26.591 --> 01:16:28.360
<v Speaker 1>His name is ahmed mohammed.</v>

2608
01:16:28.990 --> 01:16:30.670
<v Speaker 1>Almost as bad as barack obama,</v>

2609
01:16:31.180 --> 01:16:31.961
<v Speaker 1>barack hussein,</v>

2610
01:16:31.961 --> 01:16:32.411
<v Speaker 1>obama.</v>

2611
01:16:32.411 --> 01:16:32.621
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2612
01:16:32.621 --> 01:16:35.320
<v Speaker 1>it's like fucking for people looking for something bad.</v>

2613
01:16:35.321 --> 01:16:35.501
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2614
01:16:35.501 --> 01:16:36.090
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2615
01:16:36.090 --> 01:16:38.080
<v Speaker 1>who you know his fucking middle name.</v>

2616
01:16:40.370 --> 01:16:40.960
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

2617
01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:41.360
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

2618
01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:41.800
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

2619
01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:43.280
<v Speaker 1>that's a shitty story.</v>

2620
01:16:43.510 --> 01:16:44.350
<v Speaker 1>It's a terrible story.</v>

2621
01:16:44.351 --> 01:16:47.140
<v Speaker 1>The kid got arrested with a fucking nasa shirt on.</v>

2622
01:16:47.650 --> 01:16:47.981
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

2623
01:16:47.981 --> 01:16:48.790
<v Speaker 1>I noticed the ig,</v>

2624
01:16:48.790 --> 01:16:51.910
<v Speaker 1>that's where my head went at the exact same time when I saw the photo.</v>

2625
01:16:51.970 --> 01:16:52.660
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2626
01:16:52.660 --> 01:16:54.460
<v Speaker 1>he's wearing a neck that way.</v>

2627
01:16:54.670 --> 01:16:57.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why that stood out to me and made me especially sad.</v>

2628
01:16:57.220 --> 01:16:58.210
<v Speaker 1>The nasa shirt,</v>

2629
01:16:58.540 --> 01:16:59.440
<v Speaker 1>the kid's a genius.</v>

2630
01:16:59.470 --> 01:17:00.101
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>

2631
01:17:00.101 --> 01:17:00.351
<v Speaker 1>They say.</v>

2632
01:17:00.351 --> 01:17:00.671
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2633
01:17:00.671 --> 01:17:01.061
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

2634
01:17:01.061 --> 01:17:01.391
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2635
01:17:01.391 --> 01:17:02.410
<v Speaker 1>it's his own radios.</v>

2636
01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:05.650
<v Speaker 1>It sort of implied a passion for the thing,</v>

2637
01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:08.350
<v Speaker 1>for the thing that he got arrested for.</v>

2638
01:17:08.380 --> 01:17:08.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2639
01:17:08.770 --> 01:17:10.370
<v Speaker 1>Well pure racism.</v>

2640
01:17:10.430 --> 01:17:12.860
<v Speaker 1>It's racism and its purest form and you know,</v>

2641
01:17:12.861 --> 01:17:17.600
<v Speaker 1>it's just amazing that someone wasn't skilled enough to talk to this kid</v>

2642
01:17:17.750 --> 01:17:19.160
<v Speaker 1>socially skilled enough to go,</v>

2643
01:17:19.460 --> 01:17:20.000
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2644
01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:20.751
<v Speaker 1>what do you got there?</v>

2645
01:17:20.751 --> 01:17:21.321
<v Speaker 1>What's going on,</v>

2646
01:17:21.321 --> 01:17:21.770
<v Speaker 1>man?</v>

2647
01:17:21.770 --> 01:17:23.120
<v Speaker 1>And so he could have probably gone,</v>

2648
01:17:23.121 --> 01:17:23.300
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2649
01:17:23.300 --> 01:17:25.850
<v Speaker 1>I make my own computers and I make my own this.</v>

2650
01:17:25.850 --> 01:17:29.240
<v Speaker 1>And what I've done here is I've strung together all these electronics and built</v>

2651
01:17:29.241 --> 01:17:31.580
<v Speaker 1>a clock and I've figured out how to do that.</v>

2652
01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:32.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2653
01:17:32.390 --> 01:17:35.480
<v Speaker 1>you can easily talk to someone if you're skilled.</v>

2654
01:17:35.750 --> 01:17:36.340
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2655
01:17:36.340 --> 01:17:38.120
<v Speaker 1>And was a smooth talker.</v>

2656
01:17:38.150 --> 01:17:38.540
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2657
01:17:38.540 --> 01:17:39.111
<v Speaker 1>And they would get.</v>

2658
01:17:39.111 --> 01:17:41.780
<v Speaker 1>And then the kid who wouldn't feel bad at all and he could probably explain how</v>

2659
01:17:41.781 --> 01:17:43.640
<v Speaker 1>he did it and what he likes to do.</v>

2660
01:17:43.641 --> 01:17:44.061
<v Speaker 1>And you'd be like,</v>

2661
01:17:44.061 --> 01:17:47.120
<v Speaker 1>well you are an amazing student and congratulated.</v>

2662
01:17:47.121 --> 01:17:48.740
<v Speaker 1>Would you mind showing that to the class and you know,</v>

2663
01:17:48.770 --> 01:17:52.070
<v Speaker 1>and then you've got a positive out of this instead of like,</v>

2664
01:17:52.071 --> 01:17:52.771
<v Speaker 1>oh look at him.</v>

2665
01:17:52.771 --> 01:17:54.980
<v Speaker 1>He's a little brown kid and he's making a fucking bomb.</v>

2666
01:17:55.220 --> 01:17:56.210
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to kill everybody.</v>

2667
01:17:56.240 --> 01:17:57.440
<v Speaker 1>He's 14.</v>

2668
01:17:57.940 --> 01:17:58.730
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2669
01:17:58.730 --> 01:18:00.340
<v Speaker 1>how would you go look through the database?</v>

2670
01:18:00.341 --> 01:18:01.121
<v Speaker 1>Any 14 year olds,</v>

2671
01:18:01.121 --> 01:18:01.970
<v Speaker 1>suicide bombers,</v>

2672
01:18:02.290 --> 01:18:04.460
<v Speaker 1>these are there any that we've ever had in dallas?</v>

2673
01:18:04.490 --> 01:18:04.731
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2674
01:18:04.731 --> 01:18:05.564
<v Speaker 1>not here.</v>

2675
01:18:05.610 --> 01:18:05.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2676
01:18:05.810 --> 01:18:06.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean in the middle east.</v>

2677
01:18:06.980 --> 01:18:07.500
<v Speaker 1>In the middle east.</v>

2678
01:18:07.500 --> 01:18:09.080
<v Speaker 1>They've the martyrs of.</v>

2679
01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:12.410
<v Speaker 1>There was a horrible fucking documentary that I watched where they had this</v>

2680
01:18:12.830 --> 01:18:15.490
<v Speaker 1>school and they had all these kids on the wall,</v>

2681
01:18:15.510 --> 01:18:20.300
<v Speaker 1>the school that were strapped up with these explosion vests and it said today's</v>

2682
01:18:20.301 --> 01:18:22.580
<v Speaker 1>children are tomorrow's holy martyrs.</v>

2683
01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:22.741
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

2684
01:18:22.741 --> 01:18:23.400
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2685
01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:24.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2686
01:18:24.140 --> 01:18:25.400
<v Speaker 1>That's some shocking shit.</v>

2687
01:18:25.460 --> 01:18:25.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2688
01:18:25.970 --> 01:18:27.340
<v Speaker 1>it is shocking shit.</v>

2689
01:18:27.590 --> 01:18:28.310
<v Speaker 1>This kid.</v>

2690
01:18:28.310 --> 01:18:30.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's probably the best thing that happened to this kid though.</v>

2691
01:18:30.940 --> 01:18:32.360
<v Speaker 1>You see the president's tweet to them,</v>

2692
01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:33.640
<v Speaker 1>know what the president said.</v>

2693
01:18:33.650 --> 01:18:34.131
<v Speaker 1>President says,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I made went to bring that to the white house.</v>

2696
01:18:36.381 --> 01:18:38.390
<v Speaker 1>We should inspire more kids like you to do science.</v>

2697
01:18:38.391 --> 01:18:39.740
<v Speaker 1>It's what makes America great.</v>

2698
01:18:40.070 --> 01:18:42.380
<v Speaker 1>We should find out who the fuck are people are that arrested him?</v>

2699
01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:44.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's healthy.</v>

2700
01:18:44.570 --> 01:18:45.620
<v Speaker 1>That's healthy for them.</v>

2701
01:18:45.621 --> 01:18:47.060
<v Speaker 1>They need to know what it feels like.</v>

2702
01:18:47.090 --> 01:18:47.361
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

2703
01:18:47.361 --> 01:18:48.590
<v Speaker 1>but the world say,</v>

<v Speaker 1>like I'm gonna what I'm gonna do to your children.</v>

2716
01:19:14.931 --> 01:19:15.440
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

2717
01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:16.071
<v Speaker 1>how does that,</v>

2718
01:19:16.071 --> 01:19:17.750
<v Speaker 1>where did we ask,</v>

2719
01:19:17.751 --> 01:19:18.980
<v Speaker 1>how do we escalate there?</v>

2720
01:19:19.130 --> 01:19:20.060
<v Speaker 1>And it's because when,</v>

2721
01:19:20.070 --> 01:19:22.880
<v Speaker 1>when you're in this chamber of all this noise,</v>

2722
01:19:22.881 --> 01:19:27.881
<v Speaker 1>people sort of elevate their level of how much of what they're willing to do to</v>

2723
01:19:29.180 --> 01:19:31.280
<v Speaker 1>counteract this thing that they disagree with.</v>

2724
01:19:31.310 --> 01:19:31.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2725
01:19:31.810 --> 01:19:32.150
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2726
01:19:32.150 --> 01:19:33.230
<v Speaker 1>well this is also,</v>

2727
01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:36.170
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people that are super upset with their life.</v>

2728
01:19:36.230 --> 01:19:37.580
<v Speaker 1>Their life is not good.</v>

2729
01:19:37.620 --> 01:19:38.120
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2730
01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:43.120
<v Speaker 1>And they are looking for anything to be mad at and point their anger towards and</v>

2731
01:19:43.161 --> 01:19:43.670
<v Speaker 1>any,</v>

2732
01:19:43.670 --> 01:19:44.720
<v Speaker 1>anything that's justified,</v>

2733
01:19:44.721 --> 01:19:45.830
<v Speaker 1>like obviously the lion killer,</v>

2734
01:19:45.831 --> 01:19:47.510
<v Speaker 1>that's a nice big green light.</v>

2735
01:19:47.830 --> 01:19:48.081
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2736
01:19:48.081 --> 01:19:49.550
<v Speaker 1>this guy shot a fucking lion.</v>

2737
01:19:49.820 --> 01:19:53.570
<v Speaker 1>It took 40 hours for the thing to die and then they had to go in and kill it on</v>

2738
01:19:53.571 --> 01:19:54.770
<v Speaker 1>some private,</v>

2739
01:19:55.190 --> 01:19:56.360
<v Speaker 1>some public property.</v>

2740
01:19:56.361 --> 01:19:57.090
<v Speaker 1>That's not even.</v>

2741
01:19:57.090 --> 01:19:58.280
<v Speaker 1>You're not even allowed to hunt there.</v>

2742
01:19:58.730 --> 01:19:59.850
<v Speaker 1>He had a collar on the.</v>

2743
01:19:59.851 --> 01:20:00.860
<v Speaker 1>Cut the collar off.</v>

2744
01:20:00.890 --> 01:20:02.020
<v Speaker 1>The guy was a poacher.</v>

2745
01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:04.060
<v Speaker 1>He has a history of poaching.</v>

2746
01:20:04.110 --> 01:20:05.300
<v Speaker 1>He poached a bear.</v>

2747
01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:07.190
<v Speaker 1>He lied about where he shot.</v>

2748
01:20:07.260 --> 01:20:08.190
<v Speaker 1>He shot it for like 40</v>

2749
01:20:08.190 --> 01:20:09.750
<v Speaker 3>miles away from where he said he did.</v>

2750
01:20:09.990 --> 01:20:13.350
<v Speaker 3>There was all sorts of shit about that guy that was like easy to target on.</v>

2751
01:20:13.650 --> 01:20:16.020
<v Speaker 3>So then the fucking hate is free.</v>

2752
01:20:16.590 --> 01:20:17.700
<v Speaker 3>You got a green light.</v>

2753
01:20:17.701 --> 01:20:19.820
<v Speaker 3>You just close your eyes and hit the gas ball.</v>

2754
01:20:20.030 --> 01:20:22.080
<v Speaker 3>Jared jared from subway.</v>

2755
01:20:22.081 --> 01:20:22.914
<v Speaker 3>That's another one,</v>

2756
01:20:22.950 --> 01:20:23.880
<v Speaker 3>but you know what I mean?</v>

2757
01:20:24.570 --> 01:20:26.430
<v Speaker 3>That's not just legit.</v>

2758
01:20:26.590 --> 01:20:29.250
<v Speaker 3>The being how much hate is there towards that guy?</v>

2759
01:20:29.251 --> 01:20:33.310
<v Speaker 3>I didn't see the kind of death threats towards jared from subway that I saw at</v>

2760
01:20:33.311 --> 01:20:34.270
<v Speaker 3>towards the lion killer.</v>

2761
01:20:34.700 --> 01:20:39.480
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen anything like the lion killer thing was to meet evidence of a</v>

2762
01:20:39.481 --> 01:20:42.660
<v Speaker 3>complete breakdown in social media like that was.</v>

2763
01:20:42.750 --> 01:20:45.170
<v Speaker 3>Have you guys ever seen black mirror [inaudible]?</v>

2764
01:20:45.260 --> 01:20:46.350
<v Speaker 3>The david show from the uk.</v>

2765
01:20:46.351 --> 01:20:46.801
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2766
01:20:46.801 --> 01:20:48.150
<v Speaker 3>so I've only seen one episode.</v>

2767
01:20:48.151 --> 01:20:49.890
<v Speaker 3>The one with the pig got out of the first one.</v>

2768
01:20:50.090 --> 01:20:50.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2769
01:20:50.290 --> 01:20:50.850
<v Speaker 3>so I saw.</v>

2770
01:20:50.850 --> 01:20:51.121
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2771
01:20:51.121 --> 01:20:51.690
<v Speaker 3>Well that's.</v>

2772
01:20:51.690 --> 01:20:54.480
<v Speaker 3>That's the kind of example I'm talking about is it seems like,</v>

2773
01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:58.860
<v Speaker 3>but when this is the signal to noise ratio gets fucked up enough,</v>

2774
01:20:58.861 --> 01:21:01.980
<v Speaker 3>we sort of lose our faculties like your whole feed.</v>

2775
01:21:02.070 --> 01:21:03.090
<v Speaker 3>How the fuck is my.</v>

2776
01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:06.040
<v Speaker 3>I didn't sign up for a day's worth of line tweets.</v>

2777
01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:11.640
<v Speaker 3>You also have to deal with the numbers of humans that are able to communicate</v>

2778
01:21:11.641 --> 01:21:12.474
<v Speaker 3>freely.</v>

2779
01:21:12.710 --> 01:21:15.000
<v Speaker 3>That's the signal to noise ratio.</v>

2780
01:21:15.001 --> 01:21:16.050
<v Speaker 3>Like you talked about earlier,</v>

2781
01:21:16.280 --> 01:21:21.280
<v Speaker 3>that the real kicker is you used to be to be able to get on television,</v>

2782
01:21:21.781 --> 01:21:25.560
<v Speaker 3>you had to be walter cronkite and here's the news and you had to be an</v>

2783
01:21:25.561 --> 01:21:29.250
<v Speaker 3>established person who had a degree in journalism or a history as a journalist.</v>

2784
01:21:29.940 --> 01:21:34.740
<v Speaker 3>Now you just have to get on an application that anyone can download in two</v>

2785
01:21:34.741 --> 01:21:37.410
<v Speaker 3>seconds on your phone and you just start talking shit,</v>

2786
01:21:37.570 --> 01:21:37.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2787
01:21:37.820 --> 01:21:38.760
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to come to your house.</v>

2788
01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:38.941
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna.</v>

2789
01:21:38.941 --> 01:21:39.990
<v Speaker 3>Throw your kids into wood chipper,</v>

2790
01:21:39.991 --> 01:21:40.980
<v Speaker 3>like all that shit they were saying too.</v>

2791
01:21:40.990 --> 01:21:44.340
<v Speaker 3>That guy cory knowlton that shot the rhino at radio lab episode that we're</v>

2792
01:21:44.350 --> 01:21:45.183
<v Speaker 3>talking about.</v>

2793
01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:46.560
<v Speaker 3>I mean they said some horrible,</v>

2794
01:21:46.561 --> 01:21:51.180
<v Speaker 3>horrible shit to him and it's because they felt like they could and those are</v>

2795
01:21:51.181 --> 01:21:51.961
<v Speaker 3>the same people.</v>

2796
01:21:51.961 --> 01:21:53.340
<v Speaker 3>They're angry already,</v>

2797
01:21:53.570 --> 01:21:54.960
<v Speaker 3>like they're already angry.</v>

2798
01:21:54.961 --> 01:21:59.610
<v Speaker 3>This is just a nice target for that anger and it's not balanced and it doesn't</v>

2799
01:21:59.611 --> 01:22:01.140
<v Speaker 3>make sense and it's not,</v>

2800
01:22:01.141 --> 01:22:02.960
<v Speaker 3>it's not rational the,</v>

2801
01:22:02.961 --> 01:22:03.151
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2802
01:22:03.151 --> 01:22:04.740
<v Speaker 3>the focus of this anger,</v>

2803
01:22:04.890 --> 01:22:08.640
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't have to be because you don't get to pick who you're getting that</v>

2804
01:22:08.641 --> 01:22:09.660
<v Speaker 3>data from like,</v>

2805
01:22:09.661 --> 01:22:10.200
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2806
01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:14.100
<v Speaker 3>here's a perfect example was off us in this room and you know,</v>

2807
01:22:14.101 --> 01:22:16.680
<v Speaker 3>someone had done something fucked up like the lion killer guy.</v>

2808
01:22:17.010 --> 01:22:17.640
<v Speaker 3>We would,</v>

2809
01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:21.360
<v Speaker 3>we could have like a detailed discussion and how we felt about it and what are</v>

2810
01:22:21.361 --> 01:22:21.870
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2811
01:22:21.870 --> 01:22:24.180
<v Speaker 3>what are the actual facts about the case?</v>

2812
01:22:24.180 --> 01:22:28.080
<v Speaker 3>And did you know the 28 different lions wearing collars were,</v>

2813
01:22:28.170 --> 01:22:29.100
<v Speaker 3>have been killed.</v>

2814
01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:30.270
<v Speaker 3>Like it's very common.</v>

2815
01:22:30.280 --> 01:22:33.240
<v Speaker 3>They kill ones with the collar because once they go outside of the protected</v>

2816
01:22:33.241 --> 01:22:33.840
<v Speaker 3>area,</v>

2817
01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:37.260
<v Speaker 3>you're allowed to kill them and lions cover a gigantic area where they hunt,</v>

2818
01:22:38.010 --> 01:22:41.790
<v Speaker 3>so we would have these kinds of nuanced discussions because you're in a room</v>

2819
01:22:41.791 --> 01:22:43.860
<v Speaker 3>with four rational people,</v>

2820
01:22:44.070 --> 01:22:46.950
<v Speaker 3>but think about all the fucking idiots that you've met in your life.</v>

2821
01:22:47.130 --> 01:22:48.810
<v Speaker 3>Think about the millions of people.</v>

2822
01:22:48.811 --> 01:22:51.210
<v Speaker 3>If you have $350 million people in this country,</v>

2823
01:22:51.690 --> 01:22:55.260
<v Speaker 3>at least one out of 100 is a fucking idiot,</v>

2824
01:22:55.770 --> 01:22:57.780
<v Speaker 3>so that means you got 3 million,</v>

2825
01:22:57.781 --> 01:23:02.781
<v Speaker 3>500,000 fucking idiots to just smash and they're sloppy cheese doodle covered</v>

2826
01:23:04.561 --> 01:23:06.190
<v Speaker 3>fingers on keyboards</v>

2827
01:23:06.550 --> 01:23:10.990
<v Speaker 1>and fucking spitting on their screen and taking time to jack off in between</v>

2828
01:23:10.991 --> 01:23:15.991
<v Speaker 1>tweets and they smell like shit farting and wafting the fart up into their nose.</v>

2829
01:23:16.820 --> 01:23:19.870
<v Speaker 1>They're horrible monsters and there's millions of them.</v>

2830
01:23:20.010 --> 01:23:21.100
<v Speaker 1>There's millions of them,</v>

2831
01:23:21.101 --> 01:23:24.250
<v Speaker 1>and they will spend their whole day tweeting,</v>

2832
01:23:24.251 --> 01:23:27.220
<v Speaker 1>facebooking anytime something horrible goes wrong.</v>

2833
01:23:27.550 --> 01:23:28.660
<v Speaker 1>Now they have a green light.</v>

2834
01:23:28.990 --> 01:23:33.990
<v Speaker 1>I think though that it almost feels like even the intellectual web contributes</v>

2835
01:23:35.230 --> 01:23:37.210
<v Speaker 1>by enabling those fuck ups.</v>

2836
01:23:37.211 --> 01:23:38.950
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about by.</v>

2837
01:23:39.260 --> 01:23:39.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2838
01:23:39.670 --> 01:23:44.670
<v Speaker 1>by by providing the steam necessary by giving them that fragment that to work</v>

2839
01:23:46.391 --> 01:23:47.320
<v Speaker 1>with to go with,</v>

2840
01:23:47.410 --> 01:23:50.140
<v Speaker 1>well just giving them a pathway to communicate with everybody.</v>

2841
01:23:50.170 --> 01:23:50.621
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2842
01:23:50.621 --> 01:23:50.831
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2843
01:23:50.831 --> 01:23:54.400
<v Speaker 1>so an example of this would be like a media headline,</v>

2844
01:23:54.430 --> 01:23:58.630
<v Speaker 1>a juicy headline to get a person to click it even though as you mentioned</v>

2845
01:23:58.631 --> 01:23:59.110
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

2846
01:23:59.110 --> 01:24:03.220
<v Speaker 1>how it would completely lack the nuance of a proper discussion or debate,</v>

2847
01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:04.540
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>

2848
01:24:04.920 --> 01:24:05.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2849
01:24:05.380 --> 01:24:08.020
<v Speaker 1>you pander to the lowest common denominator,</v>

2850
01:24:08.021 --> 01:24:12.910
<v Speaker 1>you want as many clicks as possible and you're not necessarily concerned with</v>

2851
01:24:12.911 --> 01:24:13.810
<v Speaker 1>the outcome of that,</v>

2852
01:24:14.050 --> 01:24:14.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2853
01:24:14.590 --> 01:24:15.423
<v Speaker 1>so it's like,</v>

2854
01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:21.000
<v Speaker 1>it's like if we know that those big huge news sources that are supposed to or</v>

2855
01:24:23.021 --> 01:24:27.150
<v Speaker 1>once upon a time where it were a new nuanced or or,</v>

2856
01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:28.010
<v Speaker 1>or meant to,</v>

2857
01:24:28.150 --> 01:24:32.920
<v Speaker 1>to sort of break down the story for you to help you understand the story.</v>

2858
01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:33.521
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2859
01:24:33.521 --> 01:24:34.660
<v Speaker 1>it's all bites now.</v>

2860
01:24:34.750 --> 01:24:37.120
<v Speaker 1>It's all little fast moving bites,</v>

2861
01:24:37.121 --> 01:24:41.440
<v Speaker 1>hot takes and so on that formulate your opinion.</v>

2862
01:24:41.740 --> 01:24:43.270
<v Speaker 1>So in some ways,</v>

2863
01:24:43.330 --> 01:24:43.871
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

2864
01:24:43.871 --> 01:24:47.740
<v Speaker 1>those people should be held responsible for the things they say online,</v>

2865
01:24:47.980 --> 01:24:52.780
<v Speaker 1>but it's not like the intellectual web or the news producing web is doing the</v>

2866
01:24:52.781 --> 01:24:54.560
<v Speaker 1>greatest job in,</v>

2867
01:24:54.660 --> 01:24:56.350
<v Speaker 1>in advertising,</v>

2868
01:24:56.950 --> 01:24:58.300
<v Speaker 1>the proper content,</v>

2869
01:24:58.320 --> 01:24:58.670
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2870
01:24:58.670 --> 01:24:59.100
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2871
01:24:59.100 --> 01:25:01.920
<v Speaker 1>the nuanced longform take it.</v>

2872
01:25:01.930 --> 01:25:06.820
<v Speaker 1>So it's much easier to just slam out some knee jerk type of article and get it</v>

2873
01:25:06.821 --> 01:25:07.421
<v Speaker 1>out faster,</v>

2874
01:25:07.421 --> 01:25:10.900
<v Speaker 1>be first as opposed to maybe you're a day later,</v>

2875
01:25:10.901 --> 01:25:12.910
<v Speaker 1>but you've had time to gather more information.</v>

2876
01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:13.541
<v Speaker 1>Those.</v>

2877
01:25:13.541 --> 01:25:13.890
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2878
01:25:13.890 --> 01:25:14.340
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>

2879
01:25:14.340 --> 01:25:19.340
<v Speaker 1>the other problem is a lot of those traditional media outlets have proven to be</v>

2880
01:25:19.781 --> 01:25:23.920
<v Speaker 1>ineffective when it comes to controversial issues like the charlie hebdo issue,</v>

2881
01:25:24.370 --> 01:25:27.490
<v Speaker 1>like when charlie hebdo happened and all those guys were killed.</v>

2882
01:25:27.491 --> 01:25:27.911
<v Speaker 1>All those,</v>

2883
01:25:27.911 --> 01:25:28.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2884
01:25:28.300 --> 01:25:32.560
<v Speaker 1>cartoonists were killed by those muslim extremists that came in and were mad</v>

2885
01:25:32.561 --> 01:25:33.970
<v Speaker 1>they were making these cartoons and mohammed,</v>

2886
01:25:34.300 --> 01:25:36.100
<v Speaker 1>nobody printed those fucking cartoon.</v>

2887
01:25:36.100 --> 01:25:36.550
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

2888
01:25:36.550 --> 01:25:37.990
<v Speaker 1>The la times didn't do it.</v>

2889
01:25:37.991 --> 01:25:40.390
<v Speaker 1>The New York times didn't do at time magazine didn't do it.</v>

2890
01:25:40.391 --> 01:25:44.410
<v Speaker 1>Everybody backed off on tweeting those or taking photos and putting them online</v>

2891
01:25:44.411 --> 01:25:44.981
<v Speaker 1>or putting them in there.</v>

2892
01:25:44.981 --> 01:25:45.814
<v Speaker 1>Our articles,</v>

2893
01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:47.140
<v Speaker 1>they didn't want to do it.</v>

2894
01:25:47.230 --> 01:25:51.400
<v Speaker 1>So it was up to the internet and so then it becomes a matter of when something</v>

2895
01:25:51.401 --> 01:25:55.900
<v Speaker 1>is real and some things out there like that guy who uploaded the video of him</v>

2896
01:25:55.901 --> 01:25:56.980
<v Speaker 1>killing the reporters,</v>

2897
01:25:56.981 --> 01:26:00.100
<v Speaker 1>he killed the reporters when they were on tv and upload the video of him doing</v>

2898
01:26:00.101 --> 01:26:00.730
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2899
01:26:00.730 --> 01:26:01.421
<v Speaker 1>Oh right.</v>

2900
01:26:01.421 --> 01:26:02.254
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2901
01:26:02.570 --> 01:26:03.450
<v Speaker 1>Did they ever comes?</v>

2902
01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:03.980
<v Speaker 1>It comes a</v>

2903
01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:05.210
<v Speaker 2>real weird line.</v>

2904
01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:06.073
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2905
01:26:06.420 --> 01:26:06.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2906
01:26:06.770 --> 01:26:11.510
<v Speaker 2>part of that discussion too was like the way we were kind of forced to ingest it</v>

2907
01:26:12.140 --> 01:26:12.973
<v Speaker 2>through autoplay.</v>

2908
01:26:13.190 --> 01:26:15.840
<v Speaker 2>This was a big part of the story was how you'll.</v>

2909
01:26:15.850 --> 01:26:17.940
<v Speaker 2>Facebook has recently introduced autoplay,</v>

2910
01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:22.250
<v Speaker 2>so you're scrolling and it just plays immediately that that's another example of</v>

2911
01:26:22.251 --> 01:26:23.150
<v Speaker 2>what I'm talking about,</v>

2912
01:26:23.151 --> 01:26:23.740
<v Speaker 2>about the,</v>

2913
01:26:23.740 --> 01:26:24.000
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2914
01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:24.680
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>

2915
01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:27.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that you could call facebook intellectual web,</v>

2916
01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:32.560
<v Speaker 2>but if you're a guy like zuckerberg or someone in that office at some point you</v>

2917
01:26:33.261 --> 01:26:38.090
<v Speaker 2>know that what you're doing is you're about to introduce millions and millions</v>

2918
01:26:38.090 --> 01:26:39.590
<v Speaker 2>of people to something they probably rather not watch.</v>

2919
01:26:39.650 --> 01:26:43.850
<v Speaker 2>Well that was a big deal with isis because isis has had some of the people in</v>

2920
01:26:43.851 --> 01:26:46.190
<v Speaker 2>isis or whatever you want to call it.</v>

2921
01:26:46.490 --> 01:26:48.050
<v Speaker 2>They have had many,</v>

2922
01:26:48.051 --> 01:26:48.291
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>

2923
01:26:48.291 --> 01:26:50.720
<v Speaker 2>many accounts banned because they will,</v>

2924
01:26:50.890 --> 01:26:51.570
<v Speaker 2>they'll find these,</v>

2925
01:26:51.570 --> 01:26:52.490
<v Speaker 2>they'll make these accounts,</v>

2926
01:26:52.491 --> 01:26:55.880
<v Speaker 2>create these accounts and start uploading photos of people being beheaded,</v>

2927
01:26:56.090 --> 01:26:58.010
<v Speaker 2>uploading videos and people being beheaded.</v>

2928
01:26:58.010 --> 01:26:58.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2929
01:26:58.370 --> 01:27:02.660
<v Speaker 2>and they put these on instagram or twitter or wherever the hell they are and</v>

2930
01:27:02.661 --> 01:27:04.850
<v Speaker 2>it's up to these outlets,</v>

2931
01:27:04.851 --> 01:27:05.110
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

2932
01:27:05.110 --> 01:27:09.050
<v Speaker 2>these platforms to find these things to take them down,</v>

2933
01:27:09.051 --> 01:27:13.010
<v Speaker 2>but I went to a fucking isis twitter page that somebody has sent me to and I was</v>

2934
01:27:13.011 --> 01:27:13.161
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2935
01:27:13.161 --> 01:27:14.510
<v Speaker 2>holy shit.</v>

2936
01:27:14.540 --> 01:27:15.180
<v Speaker 2>That idea.</v>

2937
01:27:15.180 --> 01:27:16.320
<v Speaker 2>People don't even know about it.</v>

2938
01:27:16.330 --> 01:27:17.840
<v Speaker 2>They hadn't even taken this down yet.</v>

2939
01:27:18.180 --> 01:27:21.680
<v Speaker 2>Just be headings and then there was youtube videos that are linked to that.</v>

2940
01:27:21.681 --> 01:27:23.150
<v Speaker 2>They hadn't found those yet either.</v>

2941
01:27:23.420 --> 01:27:26.180
<v Speaker 2>The youtube videos where they were shooting people on the ground and cutting</v>

2942
01:27:26.181 --> 01:27:27.410
<v Speaker 2>their heads off and holding their heads.</v>

2943
01:27:27.411 --> 01:27:27.651
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2944
01:27:27.651 --> 01:27:29.540
<v Speaker 2>they'll fold deal on youtube.</v>

2945
01:27:29.590 --> 01:27:30.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2946
01:27:30.170 --> 01:27:30.600
<v Speaker 2>Well here,</v>

2947
01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:35.210
<v Speaker 2>here's my thing is I think that battle is kind of impossible to completely</v>

2948
01:27:35.211 --> 01:27:37.700
<v Speaker 2>control the speed at which people can put stuff up,</v>

2949
01:27:38.210 --> 01:27:39.590
<v Speaker 2>but the autoplay thing,</v>

2950
01:27:39.830 --> 01:27:43.790
<v Speaker 2>like half the choice to click the button at least at a minimum.</v>

2951
01:27:43.810 --> 01:27:43.921
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2952
01:27:43.921 --> 01:27:45.290
<v Speaker 2>I talked about that a couple of weeks ago,</v>

2953
01:27:45.291 --> 01:27:46.320
<v Speaker 2>somebody posted are,</v>

2954
01:27:46.321 --> 01:27:48.980
<v Speaker 2>I was just like looking at puppies and stuff and then out of nowhere it was a</v>

2955
01:27:48.981 --> 01:27:52.520
<v Speaker 2>woman in a car accident with her face missing and she was picking out her face</v>

2956
01:27:52.550 --> 01:27:52.880
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

2957
01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:57.470
<v Speaker 2>it was one of the most disturbing things I've ever seen and I think about it all</v>

2958
01:27:57.471 --> 01:27:58.100
<v Speaker 2>the time,</v>

2959
01:27:58.100 --> 01:27:58.431
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2960
01:27:58.431 --> 01:28:00.960
<v Speaker 2>like I should have never have seen that and now I can't stop thinking you didn't</v>

2961
01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:01.761
<v Speaker 2>have the option.</v>

2962
01:28:01.761 --> 01:28:02.451
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have the option.</v>

2963
01:28:02.451 --> 01:28:03.201
<v Speaker 2>I mean growing.</v>

2964
01:28:03.201 --> 01:28:05.660
<v Speaker 2>How many times have you clicked on a video and said,</v>

2965
01:28:05.690 --> 01:28:06.051
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

2966
01:28:06.051 --> 01:28:07.160
<v Speaker 2>I wish I didn't click on that.</v>

2967
01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:09.040
<v Speaker 2>And then you learn and you know,</v>

2968
01:28:09.041 --> 01:28:10.760
<v Speaker 2>like I've sent you stuff and you sent me stuff.</v>

2969
01:28:10.761 --> 01:28:10.971
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2970
01:28:10.971 --> 01:28:11.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't even want to watch that.</v>

2971
01:28:11.990 --> 01:28:12.700
<v Speaker 2>And you just,</v>

2972
01:28:12.700 --> 01:28:13.670
<v Speaker 2>you just decide,</v>

2973
01:28:13.700 --> 01:28:14.000
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2974
01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:15.140
<v Speaker 2>my life is more important now.</v>

2975
01:28:15.140 --> 01:28:19.580
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if every time those exchanges took place it autoplayed came up on your</v>

2976
01:28:19.581 --> 01:28:20.450
<v Speaker 2>phone immediately.</v>

2977
01:28:20.570 --> 01:28:21.980
<v Speaker 2>What they do that at facebook,</v>

2978
01:28:21.981 --> 01:28:25.040
<v Speaker 2>why would they rate as a great fucking reason is to,</v>

2979
01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:27.470
<v Speaker 2>to beef up their viewership figures.</v>

2980
01:28:27.530 --> 01:28:28.340
<v Speaker 2>That's stupid.</v>

2981
01:28:28.340 --> 01:28:28.501
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2982
01:28:28.501 --> 01:28:30.110
<v Speaker 2>because then they can go to advertisers and say,</v>

2983
01:28:30.111 --> 01:28:31.220
<v Speaker 2>look how many views it got.</v>

2984
01:28:32.010 --> 01:28:32.330
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2985
01:28:32.330 --> 01:28:33.770
<v Speaker 2>that's gross.</v>

2986
01:28:33.810 --> 01:28:33.910
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2987
01:28:33.910 --> 01:28:34.940
<v Speaker 2>it's the most gross thing ever,</v>

2988
01:28:34.941 --> 01:28:35.774
<v Speaker 2>and people.</v>

2989
01:28:36.150 --> 01:28:39.960
<v Speaker 2>The reason youtube has a lot of youtubers are especially upset with it.</v>

2990
01:28:39.961 --> 01:28:42.500
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of people are free booting our content,</v>

2991
01:28:42.530 --> 01:28:43.700
<v Speaker 2>not mind specifically,</v>

2992
01:28:43.701 --> 01:28:48.230
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of other ones specifically in the comedy genre because you can take</v>

2993
01:28:48.260 --> 01:28:49.430
<v Speaker 2>this clip off youtube,</v>

2994
01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:51.620
<v Speaker 2>upload it natively to facebook,</v>

2995
01:28:51.780 --> 01:28:52.790
<v Speaker 2>have it autoplay,</v>

2996
01:28:52.820 --> 01:28:57.590
<v Speaker 2>build this huge profile for yourself based off of someone else's content that</v>

2997
01:28:57.591 --> 01:28:59.190
<v Speaker 2>they've made and there's an end.</v>

2998
01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:04.020
<v Speaker 2>There's no way for you to go and track it and facebook isn't being vigilant,</v>

2999
01:29:04.050 --> 01:29:05.030
<v Speaker 2>vigilant about,</v>

3000
01:29:05.100 --> 01:29:06.690
<v Speaker 2>about going and finding that stuff.</v>

3001
01:29:06.870 --> 01:29:07.770
<v Speaker 2>In some cases,</v>

3002
01:29:07.771 --> 01:29:08.790
<v Speaker 2>youtube as I know,</v>

3003
01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:12.090
<v Speaker 2>have have missed out on millions,</v>

3004
01:29:12.180 --> 01:29:16.890
<v Speaker 2>tens of millions of views that happened elsewhere and were associated with some</v>

3005
01:29:16.891 --> 01:29:21.270
<v Speaker 2>other account on facebook and there was another account they didn't may not have</v>

3006
01:29:21.271 --> 01:29:22.104
<v Speaker 2>even known about.</v>

3007
01:29:22.140 --> 01:29:22.411
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3008
01:29:22.411 --> 01:29:22.980
<v Speaker 2>they didn't.</v>

3009
01:29:22.980 --> 01:29:25.830
<v Speaker 2>They wouldn't know about it until somebody saw it.</v>

3010
01:29:25.831 --> 01:29:28.470
<v Speaker 2>That was also a fan of theirs that would then tweet it to them or whatever and</v>

3011
01:29:28.471 --> 01:29:29.070
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

3012
01:29:29.070 --> 01:29:29.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3013
01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:32.400
<v Speaker 2>there's this completely fake profile of yours on facebook,</v>

3014
01:29:32.810 --> 01:29:34.750
<v Speaker 2>uploading all your stuff in for today.</v>

3015
01:29:34.770 --> 01:29:36.720
<v Speaker 2>Get advertising revenue from that.</v>

3016
01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:37.201
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3017
01:29:37.201 --> 01:29:41.370
<v Speaker 2>usually what usually the way it'll work is that they'll build up a large</v>

3018
01:29:41.371 --> 01:29:41.791
<v Speaker 2>profile.</v>

3019
01:29:41.791 --> 01:29:44.500
<v Speaker 2>So you take really funny 15 second videos so you should.</v>

3020
01:29:44.850 --> 01:29:45.720
<v Speaker 2>So there you go.</v>

3021
01:29:45.721 --> 01:29:50.430
<v Speaker 2>So you get a shit ton of followers and then every so often after you've got this</v>

3022
01:29:50.431 --> 01:29:51.480
<v Speaker 2>shit ton of followers,</v>

3023
01:29:51.481 --> 01:29:54.840
<v Speaker 2>you insert some branded thing that you're attempting to do and you're so you're</v>

3024
01:29:54.841 --> 01:29:58.840
<v Speaker 2>utilizing someone else's profile to build your very own it.</v>

3025
01:29:58.900 --> 01:30:01.290
<v Speaker 2>You're not necessarily making immediate money from it,</v>

3026
01:30:01.770 --> 01:30:05.340
<v Speaker 2>but you're opening up the possibility to do so after the fact.</v>

3027
01:30:05.370 --> 01:30:05.911
<v Speaker 2>Like he said,</v>

3028
01:30:05.911 --> 01:30:06.560
<v Speaker 2>with fat jew,</v>

3029
01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:06.680
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

3030
01:30:06.680 --> 01:30:08.010
<v Speaker 2>if you've got five,</v>

3031
01:30:08.011 --> 01:30:08.341
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>

3032
01:30:08.341 --> 01:30:11.400
<v Speaker 2>10 million followers on someone else's back at that point,</v>

3033
01:30:11.401 --> 01:30:12.001
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter,</v>

3034
01:30:12.001 --> 01:30:12.420
<v Speaker 2>why don't you?</v>

3035
01:30:12.420 --> 01:30:15.000
<v Speaker 2>You can shut off the old way of doing business,</v>

3036
01:30:15.240 --> 01:30:18.300
<v Speaker 2>then start doing your original stuff at that point once you've already got an</v>

3037
01:30:18.301 --> 01:30:19.134
<v Speaker 2>audience,</v>

3038
01:30:19.310 --> 01:30:19.730
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3039
01:30:19.730 --> 01:30:20.160
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3040
01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:20.341
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3041
01:30:20.341 --> 01:30:21.930
<v Speaker 2>what fat jew did is he ca,</v>

3042
01:30:21.960 --> 01:30:26.850
<v Speaker 2>he took advantage of this new way of doing comedy.</v>

3043
01:30:27.030 --> 01:30:27.660
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3044
01:30:27.660 --> 01:30:30.630
<v Speaker 2>Where you could just take a photo and put some text to it.</v>

3045
01:30:30.890 --> 01:30:32.420
<v Speaker 1>And it's one of my favorite ways of calm.</v>

3046
01:30:32.421 --> 01:30:33.740
<v Speaker 1>That thing that I sent you the other day,</v>

3047
01:30:35.570 --> 01:30:36.111
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>

3048
01:30:36.111 --> 01:30:39.740
<v Speaker 1>the one of caitlyn jenner and katelyn,</v>

3049
01:30:39.780 --> 01:30:40.370
<v Speaker 1>is that the right way?</v>

3050
01:30:40.370 --> 01:30:41.001
<v Speaker 1>That's the name?</v>

3051
01:30:41.001 --> 01:30:41.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3052
01:30:41.240 --> 01:30:42.650
<v Speaker 1>Caitlyn jenner in a,</v>

3053
01:30:42.651 --> 01:30:42.911
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3054
01:30:42.911 --> 01:30:47.911
<v Speaker 1>a porsche and it says 2011 porsche with a rebuilt tranny hole.</v>

3055
01:30:48.940 --> 01:30:50.000
<v Speaker 1>And I fucking,</v>

3056
01:30:50.510 --> 01:30:53.310
<v Speaker 1>I laughed so hard when somebody sent genius.</v>

3057
01:30:53.480 --> 01:30:55.010
<v Speaker 1>I sent it to everybody I know.</v>

3058
01:30:55.140 --> 01:30:58.490
<v Speaker 1>I was just how like you probably have no idea who created exactly.</v>

3059
01:30:58.491 --> 01:30:59.780
<v Speaker 1>I felt bad in that way.</v>

3060
01:30:59.781 --> 01:31:00.501
<v Speaker 1>That I don't know.</v>

3061
01:31:00.501 --> 01:31:02.490
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I didn't post it on social media.</v>

3062
01:31:02.491 --> 01:31:02.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3063
01:31:02.900 --> 01:31:03.740
<v Speaker 1>But I did retweet it.</v>

3064
01:31:03.741 --> 01:31:04.574
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

3065
01:31:05.240 --> 01:31:05.630
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

3066
01:31:05.630 --> 01:31:08.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean his hands super cloudy.</v>

3067
01:31:08.360 --> 01:31:09.171
<v Speaker 1>It is cloudy,</v>

3068
01:31:09.171 --> 01:31:13.850
<v Speaker 1>but what was not cloudy about the fat jew situation was that he was purposely</v>

3069
01:31:13.851 --> 01:31:16.430
<v Speaker 1>not attributing it to the people that they created it.</v>

3070
01:31:16.431 --> 01:31:19.160
<v Speaker 1>And even sometimes there's some of the other ones.</v>

3071
01:31:19.190 --> 01:31:24.190
<v Speaker 1>That girl that was changing words changing like someone had originally tweeted</v>

3072
01:31:25.761 --> 01:31:28.460
<v Speaker 1>something about a cat and she would change it to a dog,</v>

3073
01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:33.520
<v Speaker 1>but the exact same exact same joke changed and that was the other thing fat jew</v>

3074
01:31:34.791 --> 01:31:38.660
<v Speaker 1>is doing is changing the text of the image but writing the same thing.</v>

3075
01:31:38.661 --> 01:31:41.120
<v Speaker 1>So it was deliberate like there was still doing it to.</v>

3076
01:31:41.330 --> 01:31:42.010
<v Speaker 1>Is he really.</v>

3077
01:31:42.010 --> 01:31:45.200
<v Speaker 1>There was a nice article written the other day how he's still doing it and he's.</v>

3078
01:31:45.320 --> 01:31:49.350
<v Speaker 1>He also has like all these fake accounts they used at giving the a credit,</v>

3079
01:31:49.970 --> 01:31:52.100
<v Speaker 1>but it's like a locked account with one post.</v>

3080
01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:53.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3081
01:31:53.390 --> 01:31:53.751
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3082
01:31:53.751 --> 01:31:54.500
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

3083
01:31:54.500 --> 01:31:55.700
<v Speaker 1>there's some fuckery of foot.</v>

3084
01:31:55.940 --> 01:31:57.160
<v Speaker 2>It's honestly.</v>

3085
01:31:57.220 --> 01:32:00.580
<v Speaker 2>And even though those things are so enjoyable,</v>

3086
01:32:00.580 --> 01:32:04.300
<v Speaker 1>I intentionally avoided those pages on instagram just because of that reason.</v>

3087
01:32:04.390 --> 01:32:04.781
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

3088
01:32:04.781 --> 01:32:05.141
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3089
01:32:05.141 --> 01:32:07.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like I might get a laugh out of it,</v>

3090
01:32:07.061 --> 01:32:07.960
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>

3091
01:32:08.020 --> 01:32:11.220
<v Speaker 1>It's not somebodies so many creative.</v>

3092
01:32:11.221 --> 01:32:14.200
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm not buying anything from fat jew right now.</v>

3093
01:32:15.010 --> 01:32:15.821
<v Speaker 1>The problem is,</v>

3094
01:32:15.821 --> 01:32:15.960
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3095
01:32:15.960 --> 01:32:16.211
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

3096
01:32:16.211 --> 01:32:20.950
<v Speaker 1>but see the thing is that your behavior influences what gets rebroadcast,</v>

3097
01:32:20.951 --> 01:32:24.880
<v Speaker 1>especially on instagram because if it's like previous photos you've liked and</v>

3098
01:32:24.881 --> 01:32:26.440
<v Speaker 1>then in other people's discover page,</v>

3099
01:32:26.470 --> 01:32:30.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you have a lot of followers now they're seeing that thing surface so</v>

3100
01:32:30.191 --> 01:32:34.000
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to actually do shit on instagram without helping the shit that you're</v>

3101
01:32:34.001 --> 01:32:35.950
<v Speaker 1>looking at it and advertisers don't give a fuck.</v>

3102
01:32:35.951 --> 01:32:39.040
<v Speaker 1>They'll give him a shit load of money just because of all this stolen work.</v>

3103
01:32:39.041 --> 01:32:39.101
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3104
01:32:39.101 --> 01:32:39.880
<v Speaker 1>but hold on a second.</v>

3105
01:32:39.880 --> 01:32:41.230
<v Speaker 1>So if you like something.</v>

3106
01:32:41.231 --> 01:32:41.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3107
01:32:41.620 --> 01:32:42.670
<v Speaker 1>but I don't like anything.</v>

3108
01:32:42.700 --> 01:32:47.020
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's like if you go on the discover page and it'll be based on stuff</v>

3109
01:32:47.021 --> 01:32:49.360
<v Speaker 1>you've liked based on people you follow,</v>

3110
01:32:49.450 --> 01:32:53.320
<v Speaker 1>putting a picture of you up there right now based on people you follow and I</v>

3111
01:32:53.321 --> 01:32:56.620
<v Speaker 1>think there's one other one based on other photos you've liked,</v>

3112
01:32:56.621 --> 01:32:57.040
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

3113
01:32:57.040 --> 01:32:57.270
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

3114
01:32:57.270 --> 01:32:57.790
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3115
01:32:57.790 --> 01:33:01.960
<v Speaker 1>it's algorithmically trying to make suggestions for photos that you might</v>

3116
01:33:01.961 --> 01:33:02.760
<v Speaker 1>actually like.</v>

3117
01:33:02.760 --> 01:33:04.150
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's the discover page.</v>

3118
01:33:04.900 --> 01:33:06.010
<v Speaker 1>So if.</v>

3119
01:33:06.100 --> 01:33:06.311
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3120
01:33:06.311 --> 01:33:07.420
<v Speaker 1>if you don't hit the heart,</v>

3121
01:33:07.720 --> 01:33:09.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if there's a way to hit that heart.</v>

3122
01:33:10.150 --> 01:33:12.130
<v Speaker 1>You never hit the heart and fuck with by mistake.</v>

3123
01:33:12.131 --> 01:33:12.490
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

3124
01:33:12.490 --> 01:33:15.390
<v Speaker 1>You've never hit the hard hit it</v>

3125
01:33:18.060 --> 01:33:18.860
<v Speaker 1>too late.</v>

3126
01:33:18.860 --> 01:33:19.690
<v Speaker 1>Too late.</v>

3127
01:33:19.690 --> 01:33:20.590
<v Speaker 1>They got the data.</v>

3128
01:33:20.890 --> 01:33:22.930
<v Speaker 1>I'll comment on friend's stuff,</v>

3129
01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:24.550
<v Speaker 1>but I don't really like things.</v>

3130
01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:25.713
<v Speaker 1>What's this about?</v>

3131
01:33:25.810 --> 01:33:26.590
<v Speaker 1>Should I.</v>

3132
01:33:26.590 --> 01:33:26.921
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3133
01:33:26.921 --> 01:33:30.250
<v Speaker 1>I just feel like you can reciprocate a little something every so often.</v>

3134
01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:31.180
<v Speaker 1>If I saw,</v>

3135
01:33:31.180 --> 01:33:31.660
<v Speaker 1>if I,</v>

3136
01:33:31.660 --> 01:33:33.530
<v Speaker 1>if I saw joe rogan heart,</v>

3137
01:33:33.550 --> 01:33:34.950
<v Speaker 1>I might get a smile for a minute,</v>

3138
01:33:34.951 --> 01:33:35.261
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3139
01:33:35.261 --> 01:33:36.070
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know.</v>

3140
01:33:36.070 --> 01:33:36.431
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3141
01:33:36.431 --> 01:33:37.490
<v Speaker 1>I'll start heart in your stuff.</v>

3142
01:33:37.810 --> 01:33:38.690
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much.</v>

3143
01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:40.280
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

3144
01:33:40.870 --> 01:33:43.000
<v Speaker 1>Apparently you haven't been noticing my heart's well.</v>

3145
01:33:43.001 --> 01:33:43.751
<v Speaker 1>That's a thing too,</v>

3146
01:33:43.751 --> 01:33:43.981
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3147
01:33:43.981 --> 01:33:46.900
<v Speaker 1>Like I actually had put something up and gets hearted.</v>

3148
01:33:47.260 --> 01:33:47.660
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3149
01:33:47.660 --> 01:33:49.750
<v Speaker 1>you notice how many likes you have,</v>

3150
01:33:49.960 --> 01:33:53.890
<v Speaker 1>but what you don't know is how many views something's got on instagram.</v>

3151
01:33:54.010 --> 01:33:54.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3152
01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:55.233
<v Speaker 1>On twitter you do.</v>

3153
01:33:55.270 --> 01:33:56.590
<v Speaker 1>The analytics are pretty cool.</v>

3154
01:33:56.790 --> 01:33:58.510
<v Speaker 1>They're pretty interesting to see everything.</v>

3155
01:33:58.630 --> 01:33:58.811
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3156
01:33:58.811 --> 01:33:59.621
<v Speaker 1>I just got one,</v>

3157
01:33:59.621 --> 01:34:04.621
<v Speaker 1>like the nick diaz is one that I put 407,942 views.</v>

3158
01:34:05.530 --> 01:34:06.340
<v Speaker 1>Look at you.</v>

3159
01:34:06.340 --> 01:34:07.540
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome everybody,</v>

3160
01:34:07.570 --> 01:34:09.570
<v Speaker 1>everybody's looking for you to make you know,</v>

3161
01:34:09.710 --> 01:34:11.710
<v Speaker 1>to say something about that nick diaz thing.</v>

3162
01:34:11.711 --> 01:34:12.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3163
01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:13.220
<v Speaker 1>I think that'd be stoned.</v>

3164
01:34:13.420 --> 01:34:13.631
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3165
01:34:13.631 --> 01:34:16.630
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing there that those people weren't even willing to take into</v>

3166
01:34:16.631 --> 01:34:17.170
<v Speaker 1>consideration.</v>

3167
01:34:17.170 --> 01:34:18.850
<v Speaker 1>The fact that he passed two tests.</v>

3168
01:34:19.180 --> 01:34:21.580
<v Speaker 1>He passed two tests to water tests,</v>

3169
01:34:21.581 --> 01:34:26.581
<v Speaker 1>world anti doping association test and failed one from some fucking local lab</v>

3170
01:34:27.010 --> 01:34:29.950
<v Speaker 1>and the local labs numbers were off the chart,</v>

3171
01:34:29.951 --> 01:34:32.020
<v Speaker 1>so two out of three tests he passed.</v>

3172
01:34:32.170 --> 01:34:35.980
<v Speaker 1>They weren't even willing to take into consideration those other tests because</v>

3173
01:34:35.981 --> 01:34:36.970
<v Speaker 1>they didn't perform them.</v>

3174
01:34:37.210 --> 01:34:37.871
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>

3175
01:34:37.871 --> 01:34:42.640
<v Speaker 1>they're performing urine tests which are significantly less accurate than blood</v>

3176
01:34:42.641 --> 01:34:43.474
<v Speaker 1>tests,</v>

3177
01:34:43.480 --> 01:34:44.500
<v Speaker 1>so they fucked him.</v>

3178
01:34:44.560 --> 01:34:49.560
<v Speaker 1>They fucked out of $165,000 and five years of his career,</v>

3179
01:34:49.740 --> 01:34:50.351
<v Speaker 1>five years,</v>

3180
01:34:50.351 --> 01:34:52.240
<v Speaker 1>and then John Jones only got one year for cocaine.</v>

3181
01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:53.830
<v Speaker 1>He didn't get one year for cocaine.</v>

3182
01:34:53.831 --> 01:34:56.740
<v Speaker 1>Anderson silva got one year for the first steroids.</v>

3183
01:34:57.110 --> 01:34:58.130
<v Speaker 1>Jon jones has</v>

3184
01:34:58.130 --> 01:35:02.540
<v Speaker 3>not applied for a license to fight and his court case has not been settled.</v>

3185
01:35:02.541 --> 01:35:03.710
<v Speaker 3>He's not been found guilty,</v>

3186
01:35:03.980 --> 01:35:04.940
<v Speaker 3>so they don't know.</v>

3187
01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:09.590
<v Speaker 3>And his cocaine use was what's called out of competition cocaine use.</v>

3188
01:35:09.770 --> 01:35:11.750
<v Speaker 3>Like when jon jones got caught for cocaine,</v>

3189
01:35:12.020 --> 01:35:14.570
<v Speaker 3>he got caught for cocaine when he was not.</v>

3190
01:35:14.630 --> 01:35:17.660
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't going to be affecting him while he was fighting.</v>

3191
01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:19.580
<v Speaker 3>The idea with these tests,</v>

3192
01:35:19.581 --> 01:35:24.440
<v Speaker 3>with marijuana is that if you can catch someone who was taking marijuana while</v>

3193
01:35:24.441 --> 01:35:25.610
<v Speaker 3>they were competing,</v>

3194
01:35:25.850 --> 01:35:30.140
<v Speaker 3>then it could be a factor because it may affect their performance.</v>

3195
01:35:30.141 --> 01:35:30.531
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

3196
01:35:30.531 --> 01:35:31.550
<v Speaker 3>it may affect their performance.</v>

3197
01:35:31.551 --> 01:35:32.211
<v Speaker 3>But here's the deal.</v>

3198
01:35:32.211 --> 01:35:37.211
<v Speaker 3>There's no scientific evidence whatsoever that marijuana is a significant effect</v>

3199
01:35:38.631 --> 01:35:40.370
<v Speaker 3>or performance to the point where it should be banned.</v>

3200
01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:44.410
<v Speaker 3>Like caffeine significantly affects performance and it's illegal.</v>

3201
01:35:44.930 --> 01:35:49.850
<v Speaker 3>I believe you can have up to 200 milligrams of caffeine and compete under</v>

3202
01:35:49.880 --> 01:35:50.720
<v Speaker 3>olympic rules.</v>

3203
01:35:50.720 --> 01:35:51.670
<v Speaker 3>And chael sonnen,</v>

3204
01:35:51.671 --> 01:35:55.160
<v Speaker 3>he actually told me that he takes it in pill form because he doesn't want to</v>

3205
01:35:55.161 --> 01:36:00.040
<v Speaker 3>fuck up and get an extra strong cup of coffee and break the grid or a past break</v>

3206
01:36:00.050 --> 01:36:00.770
<v Speaker 3>the test.</v>

3207
01:36:00.770 --> 01:36:02.870
<v Speaker 3>But if you like go to starbucks,</v>

3208
01:36:02.930 --> 01:36:03.501
<v Speaker 3>like you know,</v>

3209
01:36:03.501 --> 01:36:03.970
<v Speaker 3>we've,</v>

3210
01:36:03.970 --> 01:36:05.510
<v Speaker 3>we've tried to figure it out before,</v>

3211
01:36:05.511 --> 01:36:08.330
<v Speaker 3>like how much caffeine is in one of those things that brian drinks because he</v>

3212
01:36:08.331 --> 01:36:12.260
<v Speaker 3>drinks those 30 hours fucking the jug star of death,</v>

3213
01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:13.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3214
01:36:13.940 --> 01:36:16.100
<v Speaker 3>but you don't really know.</v>

3215
01:36:16.101 --> 01:36:16.701
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

3216
01:36:16.701 --> 01:36:20.690
<v Speaker 3>So you have to take like a pill in order to really modulate it perfectly.</v>

3217
01:36:20.691 --> 01:36:21.560
<v Speaker 3>If you're an athlete.</v>

3218
01:36:21.650 --> 01:36:22.020
<v Speaker 3>When I was,</v>

3219
01:36:22.020 --> 01:36:23.480
<v Speaker 3>there was a significant effect.</v>

3220
01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:25.670
<v Speaker 3>Caffeine can give you more endurance.</v>

3221
01:36:25.900 --> 01:36:27.050
<v Speaker 3>We can help hundred percent.</v>

3222
01:36:27.080 --> 01:36:29.180
<v Speaker 3>I'll take caffeine before I play hockey every time.</v>

3223
01:36:29.210 --> 01:36:29.391
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3224
01:36:29.391 --> 01:36:30.350
<v Speaker 3>And it's legal.</v>

3225
01:36:30.440 --> 01:36:31.580
<v Speaker 3>It's totally legal.</v>

3226
01:36:31.700 --> 01:36:35.480
<v Speaker 3>So I mean the arguable effect that marijuana does give you,</v>

3227
01:36:35.930 --> 01:36:40.730
<v Speaker 3>it might give you some dilation of your lungs and might give you a slight</v>

3228
01:36:40.731 --> 01:36:43.520
<v Speaker 3>advantage in your cardio because of that.</v>

3229
01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:45.440
<v Speaker 3>Or a focus advantage,</v>

3230
01:36:45.441 --> 01:36:49.850
<v Speaker 3>which is like for some people could help like a guy like nick diaz,</v>

3231
01:36:49.851 --> 01:36:52.760
<v Speaker 3>it might help him be more comfortable because he likes being high all the time</v>

3232
01:36:52.761 --> 01:36:53.510
<v Speaker 3>anyway.</v>

3233
01:36:53.510 --> 01:36:54.890
<v Speaker 3>So if you let him fight high,</v>

3234
01:36:54.891 --> 01:36:55.460
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3235
01:36:55.460 --> 01:36:59.360
<v Speaker 3>but it's not enough where it's gonna allow them to hurt somebody more.</v>

3236
01:36:59.480 --> 01:36:59.721
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

3237
01:36:59.721 --> 01:37:03.290
<v Speaker 3>the idea of a performance enhancing drug is steroids,</v>

3238
01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:04.190
<v Speaker 3>eep,</v>

3239
01:37:04.190 --> 01:37:04.730
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3240
01:37:04.730 --> 01:37:08.660
<v Speaker 3>all the stuff that like those cyclists get banned for those things make you</v>

3241
01:37:08.661 --> 01:37:09.494
<v Speaker 3>stronger,</v>

3242
01:37:09.500 --> 01:37:10.221
<v Speaker 3>faster,</v>

3243
01:37:10.221 --> 01:37:11.870
<v Speaker 3>and in the case of mixed martial arts,</v>

3244
01:37:12.110 --> 01:37:13.940
<v Speaker 3>it will allow you to hurt your opponent.</v>

3245
01:37:14.390 --> 01:37:18.980
<v Speaker 3>It's arguable that marijuana does have some performance enhancing effect,</v>

3246
01:37:18.981 --> 01:37:20.210
<v Speaker 3>like with jujitsu.</v>

3247
01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:21.740
<v Speaker 3>A lot of jujitsu guys,</v>

3248
01:37:21.741 --> 01:37:22.580
<v Speaker 3>me included,</v>

3249
01:37:22.581 --> 01:37:24.380
<v Speaker 3>liked to get high before they train,</v>

3250
01:37:24.770 --> 01:37:25.131
<v Speaker 3>but man,</v>

3251
01:37:25.131 --> 01:37:26.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm not much better.</v>

3252
01:37:26.450 --> 01:37:26.781
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3253
01:37:26.781 --> 01:37:29.840
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a slight thing where your leg a little better,</v>

3254
01:37:30.290 --> 01:37:31.580
<v Speaker 3>but it's not like with pool,</v>

3255
01:37:31.670 --> 01:37:32.210
<v Speaker 3>same thing.</v>

3256
01:37:32.210 --> 01:37:34.370
<v Speaker 3>You'll feel a little more in tune with it,</v>

3257
01:37:34.550 --> 01:37:38.570
<v Speaker 3>but it's not significant enough where you wouldn't be able to perform at that</v>

3258
01:37:38.571 --> 01:37:39.320
<v Speaker 3>level without it.</v>

3259
01:37:39.320 --> 01:37:41.660
<v Speaker 3>Like when we see athletes that get off steroids,</v>

3260
01:37:42.050 --> 01:37:42.680
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

3261
01:37:42.680 --> 01:37:46.050
<v Speaker 3>the fucking drop off his god damn dramatic.</v>

3262
01:37:46.280 --> 01:37:49.100
<v Speaker 3>The difference between a steroid using athlete,</v>

3263
01:37:49.101 --> 01:37:51.020
<v Speaker 3>an athlete that's forced to go off steroids,</v>

3264
01:37:51.350 --> 01:37:52.940
<v Speaker 3>you see it in their body,</v>

3265
01:37:53.090 --> 01:37:54.470
<v Speaker 3>they get soft,</v>

3266
01:37:54.590 --> 01:37:56.640
<v Speaker 3>they see they have loose skin.</v>

3267
01:37:56.700 --> 01:37:58.320
<v Speaker 3>You see it in their physical performance,</v>

3268
01:37:58.321 --> 01:37:59.400
<v Speaker 3>they get tired quicker.</v>

3269
01:37:59.401 --> 01:38:00.390
<v Speaker 3>They're not as aggressive,</v>

3270
01:38:00.510 --> 01:38:01.650
<v Speaker 3>they're not as confident.</v>

3271
01:38:01.830 --> 01:38:03.600
<v Speaker 3>They start posting shit on their instagram.</v>

3272
01:38:03.601 --> 01:38:06.180
<v Speaker 3>Praise all this motivational shit like a suicidal stripper.</v>

3273
01:38:07.010 --> 01:38:07.860
<v Speaker 3>That's what happens,</v>

3274
01:38:07.861 --> 01:38:08.001
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3275
01:38:08.001 --> 01:38:10.370
<v Speaker 3>It starts with fuck with your head because you realize like you,</v>

3276
01:38:10.371 --> 01:38:14.100
<v Speaker 3>you got to pump yourself up because you're not jack to the tits on some</v>

3277
01:38:14.101 --> 01:38:15.510
<v Speaker 3>artificial testosterone.</v>

3278
01:38:15.570 --> 01:38:16.290
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3279
01:38:16.290 --> 01:38:19.590
<v Speaker 3>So that in comparison to pot,</v>

3280
01:38:19.620 --> 01:38:21.440
<v Speaker 3>there's no fucking comparison.</v>

3281
01:38:21.460 --> 01:38:21.810
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3282
01:38:21.810 --> 01:38:25.110
<v Speaker 3>And testosterone was legal until like a year ago.</v>

3283
01:38:25.111 --> 01:38:29.490
<v Speaker 3>There were allowing these guys to get on testosterone replacement therapy is pot</v>

3284
01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:35.000
<v Speaker 3>legal in other sports while the nba is apparently the one sport where so many</v>

3285
01:38:36.961 --> 01:38:39.530
<v Speaker 3>guys are smoking pot playing.</v>

3286
01:38:39.720 --> 01:38:40.170
<v Speaker 3>That's what I.</v>

3287
01:38:40.170 --> 01:38:42.690
<v Speaker 3>That they don't have it in the contract where they test them,</v>

3288
01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:43.910
<v Speaker 3>they don't,</v>

3289
01:38:43.910 --> 01:38:45.540
<v Speaker 3>they don't allow themselves to be tested.</v>

3290
01:38:45.541 --> 01:38:49.180
<v Speaker 3>So how is it that this is even on the table to be,</v>

3291
01:38:49.181 --> 01:38:49.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3292
01:38:49.650 --> 01:38:50.081
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

3293
01:38:50.081 --> 01:38:51.750
<v Speaker 3>because there's no union there.</v>

3294
01:38:51.751 --> 01:38:53.190
<v Speaker 3>If there was a fighters' union,</v>

3295
01:38:53.740 --> 01:38:55.890
<v Speaker 3>fighters' union could go to the athletic kind of,</v>

3296
01:38:57.090 --> 01:38:57.571
<v Speaker 3>fuck you,</v>

3297
01:38:57.571 --> 01:38:58.560
<v Speaker 3>we're not coming to vegas,</v>

3298
01:38:58.561 --> 01:38:59.394
<v Speaker 3>you dummies.</v>

3299
01:38:59.490 --> 01:39:02.130
<v Speaker 3>And then the other problem is if someone's band in vegas,</v>

3300
01:39:02.131 --> 01:39:05.820
<v Speaker 3>they're band in the world because of you violated and there's all sorts of</v>

3301
01:39:05.821 --> 01:39:06.371
<v Speaker 3>fucking loss.</v>

3302
01:39:06.371 --> 01:39:09.450
<v Speaker 3>Who bullshit part that I can't wrap my head around.</v>

3303
01:39:09.480 --> 01:39:10.111
<v Speaker 3>Not only that,</v>

3304
01:39:10.111 --> 01:39:11.940
<v Speaker 3>but you're being banned by idiots.</v>

3305
01:39:12.090 --> 01:39:12.720
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

3306
01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:15.090
<v Speaker 3>You're being banned by people who don't understand the sport.</v>

3307
01:39:15.240 --> 01:39:16.470
<v Speaker 3>If they did understand a sport,</v>

3308
01:39:16.471 --> 01:39:16.861
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

3309
01:39:16.861 --> 01:39:19.800
<v Speaker 3>they would have fired 60 percent of their judges,</v>

3310
01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:21.390
<v Speaker 3>60 percent of their judges,</v>

3311
01:39:21.690 --> 01:39:24.000
<v Speaker 3>any judge that hasn't have any martial arts experience,</v>

3312
01:39:24.020 --> 01:39:24.660
<v Speaker 3>a judge it,</v>

3313
01:39:24.660 --> 01:39:26.660
<v Speaker 3>you should run them through a course load.</v>

3314
01:39:26.730 --> 01:39:27.720
<v Speaker 3>Is this guy in danger?</v>

3315
01:39:27.740 --> 01:39:28.590
<v Speaker 3>Is he in danger?</v>

3316
01:39:28.591 --> 01:39:29.040
<v Speaker 3>Now?</v>

3317
01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:30.150
<v Speaker 3>Is this dangerous?</v>

3318
01:39:30.360 --> 01:39:31.770
<v Speaker 3>Is this submission close?</v>

3319
01:39:31.771 --> 01:39:32.690
<v Speaker 3>Is this one close?</v>

3320
01:39:32.780 --> 01:39:33.060
<v Speaker 3>How?</v>

3321
01:39:33.060 --> 01:39:34.290
<v Speaker 3>How effective is that?</v>

3322
01:39:34.660 --> 01:39:38.910
<v Speaker 3>If you don't know that you can't judge a martial arts fight on a,</v>

3323
01:39:38.911 --> 01:39:40.140
<v Speaker 3>on a professional level,</v>

3324
01:39:40.170 --> 01:39:41.250
<v Speaker 3>but yet they do,</v>

3325
01:39:41.370 --> 01:39:43.860
<v Speaker 3>so these are ineffective commissions in the first place.</v>

3326
01:39:44.010 --> 01:39:44.843
<v Speaker 3>On top of that,</v>

3327
01:39:45.030 --> 01:39:45.990
<v Speaker 3>they're bureaucrats.</v>

3328
01:39:46.020 --> 01:39:48.510
<v Speaker 3>These are government people and firing these people.</v>

3329
01:39:48.511 --> 01:39:52.620
<v Speaker 3>It's just like firing someone from the dmv or firing some from the post office.</v>

3330
01:39:52.621 --> 01:39:55.970
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking difficult and there's all sorts of hoops and latin.</v>

3331
01:39:56.010 --> 01:40:00.360
<v Speaker 3>There's protections that those people have in place that the fighters do not</v>

3332
01:40:00.361 --> 01:40:00.751
<v Speaker 3>have.</v>

3333
01:40:00.751 --> 01:40:05.751
<v Speaker 3>So you have an unfair playing field and these people have this ultimate tyranny</v>

3334
01:40:06.300 --> 01:40:07.133
<v Speaker 3>over fighters.</v>

3335
01:40:07.140 --> 01:40:10.620
<v Speaker 3>So it seems pretty obvious that Nevada is fucked,</v>

3336
01:40:10.650 --> 01:40:11.483
<v Speaker 3>fucked.</v>

3337
01:40:11.820 --> 01:40:16.820
<v Speaker 3>Is there any chance that the ufc affiliation with Nevada ever changes?</v>

3338
01:40:17.460 --> 01:40:17.641
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3339
01:40:17.641 --> 01:40:19.680
<v Speaker 3>they can't have fights in Nevada.</v>

3340
01:40:19.710 --> 01:40:20.610
<v Speaker 3>Nevada's the spot,</v>

3341
01:40:20.611 --> 01:40:20.941
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3342
01:40:20.941 --> 01:40:21.701
<v Speaker 3>If you want to have fights,</v>

3343
01:40:21.701 --> 01:40:22.500
<v Speaker 3>you go to vegas.</v>

3344
01:40:22.500 --> 01:40:22.831
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

3345
01:40:22.831 --> 01:40:23.400
<v Speaker 3>Why does it have?</v>

3346
01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:23.820
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

3347
01:40:23.820 --> 01:40:24.780
<v Speaker 3>Because it's the shit.</v>

3348
01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:26.270
<v Speaker 3>It's the best place to funding.</v>

3349
01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:29.760
<v Speaker 3>But how much could they continue to fuck up and you still continue to do it.</v>

3350
01:40:29.790 --> 01:40:31.440
<v Speaker 3>They need to be overhauled.</v>

3351
01:40:31.441 --> 01:40:32.221
<v Speaker 3>Not vegas.</v>

3352
01:40:32.221 --> 01:40:33.600
<v Speaker 3>Vegas is fucking awesome.</v>

3353
01:40:33.601 --> 01:40:34.530
<v Speaker 3>Look if you're going to have fights,</v>

3354
01:40:34.531 --> 01:40:36.850
<v Speaker 3>but I'm saying I've been tied to the mgm.</v>

3355
01:40:37.570 --> 01:40:42.090
<v Speaker 3>I've been there and fucking casinos there until 6:00 in the morning if you want.</v>

3356
01:40:42.091 --> 01:40:42.930
<v Speaker 3>I completely agree.</v>

3357
01:40:42.930 --> 01:40:45.930
<v Speaker 3>But anytime you're in any kind of negotiation,</v>

3358
01:40:45.931 --> 01:40:49.170
<v Speaker 3>you have to be willing to walk away and if they continue to fuck up,</v>

3359
01:40:49.171 --> 01:40:50.310
<v Speaker 3>what's the risk to them?</v>

3360
01:40:50.340 --> 01:40:54.670
<v Speaker 3>I think the public reaction to this and its thing is unprecedented.</v>

3361
01:40:54.671 --> 01:40:58.250
<v Speaker 3>I tweeted the phone number for the Nevada state of audition today and say,</v>

3362
01:40:58.510 --> 01:41:01.480
<v Speaker 3>please call them up and let them know how you feel about them fucking over nick</v>

3363
01:41:01.481 --> 01:41:01.770
<v Speaker 3>diaz.</v>

3364
01:41:01.770 --> 01:41:02.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm retweeted.</v>

3365
01:41:02.420 --> 01:41:04.840
<v Speaker 3>You see they can't even fucking take calls now.</v>

3366
01:41:04.870 --> 01:41:06.890
<v Speaker 3>They're just swamped and um,</v>

3367
01:41:06.910 --> 01:41:07.980
<v Speaker 3>I'll do it tomorrow too.</v>

3368
01:41:08.060 --> 01:41:08.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3369
01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:09.400
<v Speaker 3>I'll do it until they stop.</v>

3370
01:41:09.401 --> 01:41:10.660
<v Speaker 3>I'll do it for the rest of my life.</v>

3371
01:41:10.710 --> 01:41:12.010
<v Speaker 3>I'll fucking wake up every morning.</v>

3372
01:41:12.011 --> 01:41:13.000
<v Speaker 3>I have an alarm clock.</v>

3373
01:41:13.570 --> 01:41:14.110
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3374
01:41:14.110 --> 01:41:19.110
<v Speaker 3>here's the new number for the scheduled tweets that they stole five years from</v>

3375
01:41:19.661 --> 01:41:24.661
<v Speaker 3>this guy's career and they stole $165,000 from his person and they weren't even</v>

3376
01:41:24.701 --> 01:41:29.560
<v Speaker 3>willing to take into consideration the other two tests that he failed.</v>

3377
01:41:29.590 --> 01:41:31.630
<v Speaker 3>It is a goddamn dog and pony show.</v>

3378
01:41:31.631 --> 01:41:32.464
<v Speaker 3>It's a tyranny.</v>

3379
01:41:32.710 --> 01:41:34.750
<v Speaker 3>And what these people are doing is wrong.</v>

3380
01:41:34.780 --> 01:41:38.650
<v Speaker 3>It's just wrong because it's not a person who set out to cheat.</v>

3381
01:41:38.950 --> 01:41:40.900
<v Speaker 3>This is the guy who doesn't use steroids.</v>

3382
01:41:41.110 --> 01:41:43.540
<v Speaker 3>Nick diaz is notoriously anti steroids.</v>

3383
01:41:43.780 --> 01:41:45.310
<v Speaker 3>This is a guy who was one of the toughest,</v>

3384
01:41:45.311 --> 01:41:47.110
<v Speaker 3>most exciting guys in the sport.</v>

3385
01:41:47.260 --> 01:41:52.260
<v Speaker 3>He's fun to watch and also probably has social anxiety issues that marijuana</v>

3386
01:41:52.391 --> 01:41:53.141
<v Speaker 3>helps alleviate.</v>

3387
01:41:53.141 --> 01:41:53.351
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3388
01:41:53.351 --> 01:41:54.070
<v Speaker 3>I've read that.</v>

3389
01:41:54.070 --> 01:41:58.900
<v Speaker 3>I read that interview with him like about what he said shortly after.</v>

3390
01:41:58.901 --> 01:41:59.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3391
01:41:59.710 --> 01:42:00.281
<v Speaker 3>it's awful,</v>

3392
01:42:00.281 --> 01:42:01.090
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3393
01:42:01.090 --> 01:42:01.550
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3394
01:42:01.550 --> 01:42:03.370
<v Speaker 3>look what they did is wrong.</v>

3395
01:42:03.460 --> 01:42:04.190
<v Speaker 3>It's wrong.</v>

3396
01:42:04.190 --> 01:42:05.023
<v Speaker 3>It gets not.</v>

3397
01:42:05.290 --> 01:42:07.090
<v Speaker 3>You shouldn't fight high.</v>

3398
01:42:07.240 --> 01:42:07.720
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3399
01:42:07.720 --> 01:42:08.291
<v Speaker 3>If you fight,</v>

3400
01:42:08.291 --> 01:42:09.124
<v Speaker 3>hi,</v>

3401
01:42:09.610 --> 01:42:10.690
<v Speaker 3>there should be a penalty.</v>

3402
01:42:10.870 --> 01:42:11.860
<v Speaker 3>Like 50 bucks</v>

3403
01:42:13.460 --> 01:42:14.740
<v Speaker 3>for it.</v>

3404
01:42:14.820 --> 01:42:15.311
<v Speaker 3>Listen man,</v>

3405
01:42:15.311 --> 01:42:16.570
<v Speaker 3>if a guy kicks your ass high,</v>

3406
01:42:16.571 --> 01:42:17.890
<v Speaker 3>he'd probably kick your ass sober.</v>

3407
01:42:18.210 --> 01:42:18.400
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3408
01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:18.941
<v Speaker 3>I just don't.</v>

3409
01:42:18.941 --> 01:42:19.300
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

3410
01:42:19.300 --> 01:42:22.930
<v Speaker 3>It's not like taking beta blockers or something to completely eliminate your</v>

3411
01:42:22.931 --> 01:42:23.680
<v Speaker 3>nervousness.</v>

3412
01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:23.861
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3413
01:42:23.861 --> 01:42:24.371
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing.</v>

3414
01:42:24.371 --> 01:42:25.930
<v Speaker 3>That's the one thing I heard though,</v>

3415
01:42:25.931 --> 01:42:28.480
<v Speaker 3>is that maybe your pain threshold is elevated.</v>

3416
01:42:28.840 --> 01:42:29.261
<v Speaker 3>You know what,</v>

3417
01:42:29.261 --> 01:42:29.591
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

3418
01:42:29.591 --> 01:42:30.341
<v Speaker 3>I don't buy that.</v>

3419
01:42:30.341 --> 01:42:31.240
<v Speaker 3>Here's why I don't buy that.</v>

3420
01:42:31.241 --> 01:42:32.800
<v Speaker 3>You don't feel pain when you're fighting anyway.</v>

3421
01:42:33.070 --> 01:42:34.900
<v Speaker 3>You're so jacked up with adrenaline.</v>

3422
01:42:34.960 --> 01:42:37.570
<v Speaker 3>There's so many times when you fight and after it's over,</v>

3423
01:42:37.571 --> 01:42:39.790
<v Speaker 3>you realize your hand is broken or there's something wrong with you.</v>

3424
01:42:39.940 --> 01:42:40.691
<v Speaker 3>Like jon jones,</v>

3425
01:42:40.691 --> 01:42:41.441
<v Speaker 3>perfect example.</v>

3426
01:42:41.441 --> 01:42:43.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm interviewing him while I'm interviewing.</v>

3427
01:42:43.391 --> 01:42:46.160
<v Speaker 3>After you beat the shit out shell son and he looks down and sees his toe,</v>

3428
01:42:47.960 --> 01:42:49.270
<v Speaker 3>he had no idea.</v>

3429
01:42:49.450 --> 01:42:51.550
<v Speaker 3>He had no idea until he looked down.</v>

3430
01:42:51.551 --> 01:42:55.840
<v Speaker 3>He saw there's toe was flipped over and the bottom of his toes facing I was</v>

3431
01:42:55.841 --> 01:42:56.231
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

3432
01:42:56.231 --> 01:42:58.870
<v Speaker 3>I saw it happen and he immediately was,</v>

3433
01:42:58.900 --> 01:42:59.890
<v Speaker 3>oh my toe.</v>

3434
01:42:59.890 --> 01:43:00.730
<v Speaker 3>Oh man.</v>

3435
01:43:00.940 --> 01:43:01.601
<v Speaker 3>Oh man.</v>

3436
01:43:01.601 --> 01:43:04.180
<v Speaker 3>We got him a chair and he sat down and I continue the interview with him.</v>

3437
01:43:04.181 --> 01:43:06.910
<v Speaker 3>Go literally going into shock over his toe.</v>

3438
01:43:07.030 --> 01:43:07.863
<v Speaker 3>Why was that?</v>

3439
01:43:07.990 --> 01:43:09.400
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't because he was on a drug.</v>

3440
01:43:09.401 --> 01:43:10.234
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't high.</v>

3441
01:43:10.240 --> 01:43:12.040
<v Speaker 3>It was because it was his adrenaline.</v>

3442
01:43:12.070 --> 01:43:14.980
<v Speaker 3>Would that injury have had to have the fight stopped if a date,</v>

3443
01:43:15.220 --> 01:43:16.000
<v Speaker 3>most likely,</v>

3444
01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:17.840
<v Speaker 3>if it went to the end of the round or whatever.</v>

3445
01:43:17.841 --> 01:43:19.750
<v Speaker 3>Ryan hall had a similar injury.</v>

3446
01:43:19.751 --> 01:43:20.800
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't to his big toe,</v>

3447
01:43:20.801 --> 01:43:24.640
<v Speaker 3>but it's one of his other toes was a compound fracture was broken and the bone</v>

3448
01:43:24.641 --> 01:43:29.170
<v Speaker 3>was poking out of his toe and he still fought two more rounds with it and he</v>

3449
01:43:29.171 --> 01:43:32.860
<v Speaker 3>still threw kicks with that fucking leg and won the fight.</v>

3450
01:43:33.250 --> 01:43:34.420
<v Speaker 3>That's how tough uriah hall.</v>

3451
01:43:35.110 --> 01:43:35.801
<v Speaker 3>But I mean,</v>

3452
01:43:35.801 --> 01:43:36.850
<v Speaker 3>he had to,</v>

3453
01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:37.241
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3454
01:43:37.241 --> 01:43:39.070
<v Speaker 3>he had to be mentally tough.</v>

3455
01:43:39.100 --> 01:43:39.341
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3456
01:43:39.341 --> 01:43:40.300
<v Speaker 3>he had to go back to his corner.</v>

3457
01:43:40.300 --> 01:43:43.420
<v Speaker 3>He realized his toe is completely fucked and he just said,</v>

3458
01:43:43.421 --> 01:43:43.870
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3459
01:43:43.870 --> 01:43:44.703
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

3460
01:43:44.710 --> 01:43:46.510
<v Speaker 3>And I mean limped back to his corner.</v>

3461
01:43:46.511 --> 01:43:48.310
<v Speaker 3>But once the round started,</v>

3462
01:43:48.311 --> 01:43:51.470
<v Speaker 3>dude was on his feet and moving around like nothing was wrong.</v>

3463
01:43:51.471 --> 01:43:53.390
<v Speaker 3>He just dealt with the pain and said,</v>

3464
01:43:53.391 --> 01:43:54.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to win this fucking fight.</v>

3465
01:43:54.531 --> 01:43:55.364
<v Speaker 3>Anyway.</v>

3466
01:43:55.400 --> 01:43:55.791
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3467
01:43:55.791 --> 01:43:58.520
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of that is also because of adrenaline.</v>

3468
01:43:58.600 --> 01:44:00.860
<v Speaker 3>Your adrenaline shields you from a,</v>

3469
01:44:00.861 --> 01:44:01.071
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3470
01:44:01.071 --> 01:44:03.890
<v Speaker 3>your adrenaline realizes you're in a battle for your life.</v>

3471
01:44:03.950 --> 01:44:05.290
<v Speaker 3>You don't need to worry about bruises,</v>

3472
01:44:05.330 --> 01:44:06.560
<v Speaker 3>you don't need to worry about pain.</v>

3473
01:44:06.890 --> 01:44:09.710
<v Speaker 3>It's not pain necessarily that stops fighters.</v>

3474
01:44:09.920 --> 01:44:13.130
<v Speaker 3>It's debilitating techniques like a liver shot.</v>

3475
01:44:13.160 --> 01:44:14.510
<v Speaker 3>When you get hit with a liver shot,</v>

3476
01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:15.710
<v Speaker 3>it's not like,</v>

3477
01:44:15.740 --> 01:44:16.161
<v Speaker 3>oh my god,</v>

3478
01:44:16.161 --> 01:44:16.911
<v Speaker 3>it was so painful.</v>

3479
01:44:16.911 --> 01:44:18.230
<v Speaker 3>It fucking definitely hurts.</v>

3480
01:44:18.380 --> 01:44:19.940
<v Speaker 3>But the real problem with the liver shot,</v>

3481
01:44:19.941 --> 01:44:21.500
<v Speaker 3>as it shuts your system down,</v>

3482
01:44:21.770 --> 01:44:23.210
<v Speaker 3>your system doesn't work anymore.</v>

3483
01:44:23.210 --> 01:44:25.580
<v Speaker 3>You get nailed with like a left hook to the liver,</v>

3484
01:44:25.640 --> 01:44:26.001
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>

3485
01:44:26.001 --> 01:44:26.780
<v Speaker 3>it hits you.</v>

3486
01:44:26.780 --> 01:44:30.260
<v Speaker 3>And it's this crazy feeling like your breath doesn't work anymore,</v>

3487
01:44:30.440 --> 01:44:31.940
<v Speaker 3>your legs lock up and you're like,</v>

3488
01:44:32.840 --> 01:44:34.250
<v Speaker 3>it's not a pain thing.</v>

3489
01:44:34.430 --> 01:44:35.870
<v Speaker 3>It's a system shut down.</v>

3490
01:44:35.871 --> 01:44:36.890
<v Speaker 3>When you get knocked out,</v>

3491
01:44:37.220 --> 01:44:38.210
<v Speaker 3>you get kicked in the head.</v>

3492
01:44:38.211 --> 01:44:38.850
<v Speaker 3>It's not that your.</v>

3493
01:44:38.850 --> 01:44:39.800
<v Speaker 3>Your head hurts,</v>

3494
01:44:39.830 --> 01:44:40.790
<v Speaker 3>of course it hurts,</v>

3495
01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:42.530
<v Speaker 3>but the real problem is not paying.</v>

3496
01:44:42.710 --> 01:44:46.040
<v Speaker 3>The real problem is your brain shuts off your brain.</v>

3497
01:44:46.041 --> 01:44:47.180
<v Speaker 3>You get net kicked,</v>

3498
01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:49.190
<v Speaker 3>he cuts off the circulation to your brain,</v>

3499
01:44:49.550 --> 01:44:50.970
<v Speaker 3>spark the other.</v>

3500
01:44:50.980 --> 01:44:52.790
<v Speaker 3>The fucking nerves get shattered.</v>

3501
01:44:52.791 --> 01:44:55.250
<v Speaker 3>Everything get walked out and your brain goes,</v>

3502
01:44:55.251 --> 01:44:55.551
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3503
01:44:55.551 --> 01:44:55.791
<v Speaker 3>night,</v>

3504
01:44:55.791 --> 01:44:56.270
<v Speaker 3>night,</v>

3505
01:44:56.270 --> 01:44:57.103
<v Speaker 3>and you shut off.</v>

3506
01:44:57.110 --> 01:44:58.100
<v Speaker 3>It's a full system.</v>

3507
01:44:58.330 --> 01:44:59.630
<v Speaker 3>Wasn't a choice at all,</v>

3508
01:44:59.631 --> 01:45:00.141
<v Speaker 3>honestly.</v>

3509
01:45:00.141 --> 01:45:00.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3510
01:45:00.410 --> 01:45:02.540
<v Speaker 3>there's pain that these guys experience,</v>

3511
01:45:02.630 --> 01:45:06.110
<v Speaker 3>but that's not necessarily what stops fights.</v>

3512
01:45:06.200 --> 01:45:07.760
<v Speaker 3>So the pain threshold thing,</v>

3513
01:45:08.120 --> 01:45:08.953
<v Speaker 3>I don't buy it.</v>

3514
01:45:09.280 --> 01:45:11.570
<v Speaker 3>I think the real pain threshold is adrenaline.</v>

3515
01:45:11.840 --> 01:45:13.730
<v Speaker 3>That's what really keeps you from feeling pain.</v>

3516
01:45:13.731 --> 01:45:15.320
<v Speaker 3>And we're going to have that naturally.</v>

3517
01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:16.820
<v Speaker 3>That's the most effective thing.</v>

3518
01:45:17.060 --> 01:45:22.060
<v Speaker 3>Marijuana is an effective pain reducer after competition or after training.</v>

3519
01:45:22.191 --> 01:45:24.710
<v Speaker 3>It's with one of the things that people really like to do.</v>

3520
01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:26.450
<v Speaker 3>They have a hard day of training.</v>

3521
01:45:26.660 --> 01:45:27.580
<v Speaker 3>They like to sit back,</v>

3522
01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:29.420
<v Speaker 3>smoke a joint and watch a little tv.</v>

3523
01:45:29.480 --> 01:45:29.631
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3524
01:45:29.631 --> 01:45:31.400
<v Speaker 3>they can't do that if they're being tested,</v>

3525
01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:32.181
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3526
01:45:32.181 --> 01:45:34.580
<v Speaker 3>in this district and so on.</v>

3527
01:45:34.581 --> 01:45:35.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3528
01:45:35.060 --> 01:45:35.990
<v Speaker 3>Well again,</v>

3529
01:45:36.110 --> 01:45:37.100
<v Speaker 3>the marijuana thing,</v>

3530
01:45:37.101 --> 01:45:39.020
<v Speaker 3>they've changed the threshold considerably.</v>

3531
01:45:39.021 --> 01:45:39.920
<v Speaker 3>And I had jeff,</v>

3532
01:45:39.921 --> 01:45:41.210
<v Speaker 3>no wicki on the podcast.</v>

3533
01:45:41.240 --> 01:45:42.550
<v Speaker 3>I listened to that episode now.</v>

3534
01:45:42.680 --> 01:45:43.220
<v Speaker 3>Amazing.</v>

3535
01:45:43.220 --> 01:45:45.740
<v Speaker 3>Really interesting guy and very smart and very,</v>

3536
01:45:45.741 --> 01:45:45.971
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3537
01:45:45.971 --> 01:45:47.240
<v Speaker 3>on top of the testing thing.</v>

3538
01:45:47.570 --> 01:45:48.403
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

3539
01:45:48.470 --> 01:45:51.050
<v Speaker 3>it's out of competition if you're not,</v>

3540
01:45:51.260 --> 01:45:51.530
<v Speaker 3>if you're.</v>

3541
01:45:51.530 --> 01:45:56.060
<v Speaker 3>You would literally have to get high the day of the fight to test positive.</v>

3542
01:45:56.060 --> 01:45:57.350
<v Speaker 3>Now that's the way they're doing it.</v>

3543
01:45:57.560 --> 01:46:02.560
<v Speaker 3>So the test that diaz got popped for was before this alteration was made dope.</v>

3544
01:46:04.190 --> 01:46:05.900
<v Speaker 3>It's by the current standards.</v>

3545
01:46:06.230 --> 01:46:11.030
<v Speaker 3>So the problem is he tested twice under the threshold of the current standards.</v>

3546
01:46:11.450 --> 01:46:15.590
<v Speaker 3>The water tests had him under the threshold which says he was not high when he</v>

3547
01:46:15.591 --> 01:46:16.424
<v Speaker 3>competed,</v>

3548
01:46:16.580 --> 01:46:18.470
<v Speaker 3>but the tasks that they use from,</v>

3549
01:46:18.471 --> 01:46:20.060
<v Speaker 3>I believe it was quest labs,</v>

3550
01:46:20.210 --> 01:46:21.043
<v Speaker 3>sorry if I'm wrong,</v>

3551
01:46:21.320 --> 01:46:22.280
<v Speaker 3>but I believe which is,</v>

3552
01:46:22.390 --> 01:46:22.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3553
01:46:22.890 --> 01:46:23.810
<v Speaker 3>a very good lab,</v>

3554
01:46:23.930 --> 01:46:28.610
<v Speaker 3>but it showed have completely different test than the test that water</v>

3555
01:46:28.640 --> 01:46:29.473
<v Speaker 3>instituted.</v>

3556
01:46:29.540 --> 01:46:30.440
<v Speaker 3>On top of that,</v>

3557
01:46:30.441 --> 01:46:31.070
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

3558
01:46:31.070 --> 01:46:32.480
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about urine,</v>

3559
01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:36.570
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about urine versus blood and when you're testing metabolite,</v>

3560
01:46:36.580 --> 01:46:37.413
<v Speaker 3>so why,</v>

3561
01:46:37.430 --> 01:46:39.110
<v Speaker 3>why in that particular,</v>

3562
01:46:39.230 --> 01:46:40.580
<v Speaker 3>in this particular case,</v>

3563
01:46:40.581 --> 01:46:43.830
<v Speaker 3>did that test take precedent over the water there?</v>

3564
01:46:43.850 --> 01:46:44.660
<v Speaker 3>Test.</v>

3565
01:46:44.660 --> 01:46:45.380
<v Speaker 3>Who's they?</v>

3566
01:46:45.380 --> 01:46:46.640
<v Speaker 3>Nevada state athletic commission.</v>

3567
01:46:46.670 --> 01:46:47.480
<v Speaker 3>That's where it's fucked.</v>

3568
01:46:47.480 --> 01:46:47.930
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>

3569
01:46:47.930 --> 01:46:49.010
<v Speaker 3>The ufc is test.</v>

3570
01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:52.050
<v Speaker 3>The ufc has no fucking place in this.</v>

3571
01:46:52.170 --> 01:46:53.310
<v Speaker 3>They brought in the u.</v>

3572
01:46:53.311 --> 01:46:54.220
<v Speaker 3>S ada,</v>

3573
01:46:54.300 --> 01:46:55.890
<v Speaker 3>us anti-doping association,</v>

3574
01:46:56.070 --> 01:46:57.480
<v Speaker 3>which is where it novitsky comes up.</v>

3575
01:46:57.500 --> 01:46:57.720
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

3576
01:46:57.720 --> 01:46:57.930
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

3577
01:46:57.930 --> 01:46:58.761
<v Speaker 3>Brought those guys in.</v>

3578
01:46:58.761 --> 01:47:02.100
<v Speaker 3>I guess I'm referring to them as they use because they're high.</v>

3579
01:47:02.120 --> 01:47:03.240
<v Speaker 3>They are hired by them.</v>

3580
01:47:03.270 --> 01:47:05.640
<v Speaker 3>They're hired by the ufc to clean up the sport,</v>

3581
01:47:05.641 --> 01:47:08.760
<v Speaker 3>but they have no say on how the tests are implemented,</v>

3582
01:47:08.761 --> 01:47:10.050
<v Speaker 3>how the results are dispersed,</v>

3583
01:47:10.500 --> 01:47:13.650
<v Speaker 3>what the idea of bringing in the government and bringing in a guy like novitsky</v>

3584
01:47:13.651 --> 01:47:14.011
<v Speaker 3>wicki is,</v>

3585
01:47:14.011 --> 01:47:14.221
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

3586
01:47:14.221 --> 01:47:15.330
<v Speaker 3>if you really want to clean up,</v>

3587
01:47:15.420 --> 01:47:16.253
<v Speaker 3>clean up the sport,</v>

3588
01:47:16.410 --> 01:47:19.650
<v Speaker 3>you hire a fucking bulldog who's just going to go after it.</v>

3589
01:47:19.950 --> 01:47:22.830
<v Speaker 3>You don't do it yourself because if you do it yourself,</v>

3590
01:47:23.070 --> 01:47:27.540
<v Speaker 3>there's always the possibility that someone could hide the results because</v>

3591
01:47:27.630 --> 01:47:31.650
<v Speaker 3>there's a financial interest like you would know you would test conor mcgregor.</v>

3592
01:47:31.650 --> 01:47:32.060
<v Speaker 3>He finally,</v>

3593
01:47:32.060 --> 01:47:32.791
<v Speaker 3>he's fighting high,</v>

3594
01:47:32.791 --> 01:47:33.790
<v Speaker 3>like little calm.</v>

3595
01:47:34.580 --> 01:47:35.413
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>

3596
01:47:36.240 --> 01:47:37.350
<v Speaker 3>you're saying some great shit.</v>

3597
01:47:37.410 --> 01:47:39.360
<v Speaker 3>He can't fight high dude,</v>

3598
01:47:39.660 --> 01:47:41.790
<v Speaker 3>but with the usa da,</v>

3599
01:47:42.450 --> 01:47:44.130
<v Speaker 3>you don't have a say in how the stuff is.</v>

3600
01:47:44.170 --> 01:47:46.110
<v Speaker 3>You don't have that sounds perfect.</v>

3601
01:47:46.111 --> 01:47:46.710
<v Speaker 3>Exactly,</v>

3602
01:47:46.710 --> 01:47:48.440
<v Speaker 3>and that's how they want to do it and that's what.</v>

3603
01:47:48.441 --> 01:47:49.650
<v Speaker 3>That's what that show,</v>

3604
01:47:49.651 --> 01:47:52.800
<v Speaker 3>but I don't understand what medina understand what good it is.</v>

3605
01:47:52.890 --> 01:47:57.890
<v Speaker 3>If what do you wasted all this money for it because the Nevada state athletic</v>

3606
01:47:58.051 --> 01:48:02.040
<v Speaker 3>commission is incompetent and there they are a tyranny and they are a bunch of</v>

3607
01:48:02.041 --> 01:48:02.710
<v Speaker 3>people that haven't.</v>

3608
01:48:02.710 --> 01:48:05.460
<v Speaker 3>If you watch the fucking the commission,</v>

3609
01:48:05.640 --> 01:48:07.350
<v Speaker 3>those people are drunk with power.</v>

3610
01:48:07.590 --> 01:48:10.290
<v Speaker 3>They're drunk with power and they felt like they were making made fools of</v>

3611
01:48:10.500 --> 01:48:12.420
<v Speaker 3>because he's tested positive before,</v>

3612
01:48:12.690 --> 01:48:14.160
<v Speaker 3>but he tested positive before,</v>

3613
01:48:14.161 --> 01:48:15.720
<v Speaker 3>under their different thresholds.</v>

3614
01:48:15.721 --> 01:48:19.200
<v Speaker 3>The thresholds that existed before the current established standard.</v>

3615
01:48:20.710 --> 01:48:21.421
<v Speaker 3>It's all fucked.</v>

3616
01:48:21.421 --> 01:48:23.100
<v Speaker 3>Who hires these people like where?</v>

3617
01:48:23.160 --> 01:48:23.791
<v Speaker 3>It's a good question.</v>

3618
01:48:23.791 --> 01:48:24.700
<v Speaker 3>Like where?</v>

3619
01:48:25.080 --> 01:48:25.740
<v Speaker 3>Who do you,</v>

3620
01:48:25.740 --> 01:48:26.820
<v Speaker 3>who do you go after?</v>

3621
01:48:26.821 --> 01:48:27.690
<v Speaker 3>Is there some kind?</v>

3622
01:48:27.720 --> 01:48:30.390
<v Speaker 3>Is it the governor at the highest level?</v>

3623
01:48:30.420 --> 01:48:31.590
<v Speaker 3>It should be the government.</v>

3624
01:48:31.660 --> 01:48:32.431
<v Speaker 3>The governor.</v>

3625
01:48:32.431 --> 01:48:35.490
<v Speaker 3>I think the governor did step in once and there was an investigation one,</v>

3626
01:48:35.491 --> 01:48:36.580
<v Speaker 3>there was a woman who was.</v>

3627
01:48:36.900 --> 01:48:37.320
<v Speaker 3>She was.</v>

3628
01:48:37.320 --> 01:48:40.350
<v Speaker 3>She judged the tim bradley manny pacquiao,</v>

3629
01:48:40.351 --> 01:48:43.830
<v Speaker 3>fight like really poorly and she was one of the reasons why pack y'all didn't</v>

3630
01:48:43.831 --> 01:48:46.230
<v Speaker 3>win that fight and then they went over her,</v>

3631
01:48:46.530 --> 01:48:49.200
<v Speaker 3>her history of judging fights and they're like,</v>

3632
01:48:49.201 --> 01:48:50.310
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>

3633
01:48:50.420 --> 01:48:53.950
<v Speaker 3>Like she gets a lot of fights wrong and she would get fights wrong that like</v>

3634
01:48:53.970 --> 01:48:57.990
<v Speaker 3>we're a greeley bad decisions and so they were trying to figure out like,</v>

3635
01:48:57.991 --> 01:48:59.250
<v Speaker 3>what does she know about fight?</v>

3636
01:48:59.251 --> 01:48:59.600
<v Speaker 3>Does she know?</v>

3637
01:48:59.600 --> 01:48:59.940
<v Speaker 3>Anyhow,</v>

3638
01:48:59.940 --> 01:49:00.890
<v Speaker 3>she got this job,</v>

3639
01:49:01.260 --> 01:49:01.981
<v Speaker 3>hired her,</v>

3640
01:49:01.981 --> 01:49:02.970
<v Speaker 3>how does this work?</v>

3641
01:49:03.270 --> 01:49:07.800
<v Speaker 3>And so the governor stepped in because there was a national outcry over a couple</v>

3642
01:49:07.801 --> 01:49:10.170
<v Speaker 3>of boxing decisions and I say it,</v>

3643
01:49:10.171 --> 01:49:12.150
<v Speaker 3>his office needs to be bombarded right now.</v>

3644
01:49:12.630 --> 01:49:13.411
<v Speaker 3>I hope they are.</v>

3645
01:49:13.411 --> 01:49:13.531
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3646
01:49:13.531 --> 01:49:14.760
<v Speaker 3>there's a government petition,</v>

3647
01:49:14.761 --> 01:49:18.120
<v Speaker 3>somebody put out a white house petition to reinstate nick diaz,</v>

3648
01:49:18.300 --> 01:49:19.470
<v Speaker 3>but what's what,</v>

3649
01:49:19.500 --> 01:49:20.580
<v Speaker 3>what's shown up,</v>

3650
01:49:20.610 --> 01:49:21.900
<v Speaker 3>this is what needed to be done.</v>

3651
01:49:22.020 --> 01:49:22.410
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

3652
01:49:22.410 --> 01:49:24.000
<v Speaker 3>And this is the good thing about this.</v>

3653
01:49:24.210 --> 01:49:27.840
<v Speaker 3>We needed to see how dumb these fucking people are or I need to see how bad they</v>

3654
01:49:27.841 --> 01:49:28.740
<v Speaker 3>are at their jobs,</v>

3655
01:49:28.860 --> 01:49:30.450
<v Speaker 3>how cruel they are,</v>

3656
01:49:30.600 --> 01:49:31.740
<v Speaker 3>how callous they are.</v>

3657
01:49:31.741 --> 01:49:32.574
<v Speaker 3>The fact that they don't,</v>

3658
01:49:32.700 --> 01:49:37.700
<v Speaker 3>they just think it's think it's okay to take away $165,000 from the guys purse</v>

3659
01:49:37.980 --> 01:49:42.420
<v Speaker 3>and take away his ability to compete and make a living for five years in his</v>

3660
01:49:42.421 --> 01:49:43.200
<v Speaker 3>prime.</v>

3661
01:49:43.200 --> 01:49:45.060
<v Speaker 3>It's career just over.</v>

3662
01:49:45.100 --> 01:49:45.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3663
01:49:45.450 --> 01:49:47.100
<v Speaker 3>five years is a career killer.</v>

3664
01:49:47.470 --> 01:49:48.280
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3665
01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:48.890
<v Speaker 3>nick,</v>

3666
01:49:48.890 --> 01:49:50.380
<v Speaker 3>how did you come up with that number?</v>

3667
01:49:50.381 --> 01:49:51.214
<v Speaker 3>Because they're assholes.</v>

3668
01:49:51.490 --> 01:49:53.050
<v Speaker 3>Did that number come just come out of.</v>

3669
01:49:53.110 --> 01:49:53.890

3670
01:49:53.890 --> 01:49:54.723
<v Speaker 3>I've never heard.</v>

3671
01:49:54.760 --> 01:49:55.750
<v Speaker 3>Maybe with the exception of.</v>

3672
01:49:55.751 --> 01:49:56.584
<v Speaker 3>What's his name?</v>

3673
01:49:56.920 --> 01:50:01.630
<v Speaker 3>The guy who the manko alexander's flamenco got tested positive in California and</v>

3677
01:50:08.650 --> 01:50:09.760
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't want any of that shit.</v>

3678
01:50:09.761 --> 01:50:11.770
<v Speaker 3>And schlep mancos tests were through the roof.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You never know.</v>

3689

<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

01:50:24.011 --> 01:50:28.600
<v Speaker 3>Even in the case of steroids where it's an obvious performance enhancer,</v>

3692
01:50:28.960 --> 01:50:31.750
<v Speaker 3>how do you feel about a five year suspension for that?</v>

3693
01:50:31.780 --> 01:50:33.220
<v Speaker 3>Like a five year suspension?</v>

3694
01:50:33.220 --> 01:50:33.640
<v Speaker 3>Is that,</v>

3695
01:50:33.640 --> 01:50:35.680
<v Speaker 3>is there ever a place for five years?</v>

3696
01:50:35.740 --> 01:50:35.921
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3697
01:50:35.921 --> 01:50:36.311
<v Speaker 3>here's the thing.</v>

3698
01:50:36.311 --> 01:50:39.040
<v Speaker 3>Devonna tried to ban vandelay silva for a lifetime.</v>

3699
01:50:39.041 --> 01:50:40.050
<v Speaker 3>That was what I was thinking of.</v>

3700
01:50:40.060 --> 01:50:40.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3701
01:50:40.330 --> 01:50:41.330
<v Speaker 3>that's who I was last.</v>

3702
01:50:41.410 --> 01:50:42.820
<v Speaker 3>That they lost that in court.</v>

3703
01:50:43.420 --> 01:50:44.440
<v Speaker 3>They could so they couldn't.</v>

3704
01:50:44.500 --> 01:50:45.281
<v Speaker 3>They went to court.</v>

3705
01:50:45.281 --> 01:50:47.320
<v Speaker 3>Vandelays lawyers went to court and they beat that.</v>

3706
01:50:47.350 --> 01:50:50.380
<v Speaker 3>Of course they beat him because he didn't live in test positive for anything.</v>

3707
01:50:50.381 --> 01:50:51.190
<v Speaker 3>Ran away from the test.</v>

3708
01:50:51.190 --> 01:50:54.700
<v Speaker 3>You ran away from the tests that you run away from the test.</v>

3709
01:50:54.701 --> 01:50:55.331
<v Speaker 3>In their eyes,</v>

3710
01:50:55.331 --> 01:50:57.940
<v Speaker 3>you're guilty and they wanted to send a message.</v>

3711
01:50:57.941 --> 01:51:00.310
<v Speaker 3>They're not to be trifled with says,</v>

3712
01:51:00.320 --> 01:51:01.450
<v Speaker 3>d is going to take this to court.</v>

3713
01:51:01.451 --> 01:51:01.751
<v Speaker 3>You think,</v>

3714
01:51:01.751 --> 01:51:02.381
<v Speaker 3>fuck yeah,</v>

3715
01:51:02.381 --> 01:51:03.280
<v Speaker 3>and he's going to win too.</v>

3716
01:51:03.281 --> 01:51:05.170
<v Speaker 3>And I hope he sues the shit out of them.</v>

3717
01:51:05.530 --> 01:51:07.450
<v Speaker 3>I hope he soon as the shit out of him.</v>

3718
01:51:07.451 --> 01:51:12.451
<v Speaker 3>I really do and I hope he wins and I hope that the governor steps in or someone</v>

3719
01:51:12.461 --> 01:51:14.260
<v Speaker 3>steps in because my say you,</v>

3720
01:51:14.350 --> 01:51:17.620
<v Speaker 3>there are people that you can hire that will understand what the fuck is going</v>

3721
01:51:17.621 --> 01:51:18.100
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

3722
01:51:18.100 --> 01:51:19.510
<v Speaker 3>You need former athletes.</v>

3723
01:51:19.720 --> 01:51:23.650
<v Speaker 3>You need people who are experts in science and medicine that understand what the</v>

3724
01:51:23.651 --> 01:51:24.371
<v Speaker 3>thresholds are.</v>

3725
01:51:24.371 --> 01:51:27.880
<v Speaker 3>Understand the difference between urine tests and blood tests if you and also</v>

3726
01:51:28.030 --> 01:51:30.210
<v Speaker 3>you need commissioners that you.</v>

3727
01:51:30.211 --> 01:51:30.510
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

3728
01:51:30.510 --> 01:51:31.840
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna need people that are,</v>

3729
01:51:31.900 --> 01:51:36.580
<v Speaker 3>that have the educated ability to make these judgements based on whatever</v>

3730
01:51:36.581 --> 01:51:40.240
<v Speaker 3>discipline that they would need to be a master of.</v>

3731
01:51:40.330 --> 01:51:41.150
<v Speaker 3>To understand this,</v>

3732
01:51:41.150 --> 01:51:42.370
<v Speaker 3>like if you're talking about steroids,</v>

3733
01:51:42.550 --> 01:51:44.950
<v Speaker 3>you would need someone who's a steroid expert if you're talking about</v>

3734
01:51:44.951 --> 01:51:48.160
<v Speaker 3>performance enhancing drugs like meth or you would need someone.</v>

3735
01:51:48.280 --> 01:51:53.280
<v Speaker 3>You should have to establish the fact that you understand what the effects of</v>

3736
01:51:53.411 --> 01:51:54.161
<v Speaker 3>all these things are.</v>

3737
01:51:54.161 --> 01:51:57.940
<v Speaker 3>You shouldn't have to have some education and the effects of all these things.</v>

3738
01:51:58.210 --> 01:51:59.440
<v Speaker 3>Now with marijuana,</v>

3739
01:51:59.610 --> 01:52:00.070
<v Speaker 3>there's.</v>

3740
01:52:00.070 --> 01:52:02.320
<v Speaker 3>There's no data you've just got.</v>

3741
01:52:02.321 --> 01:52:05.230
<v Speaker 3>You've got no data that shows that if a person takes marijuana,</v>

3742
01:52:05.231 --> 01:52:08.320
<v Speaker 3>they can hurt someone more easily than if they don't take marijuana.</v>

3743
01:52:08.530 --> 01:52:09.760
<v Speaker 3>So as soon as you have that,</v>

3744
01:52:09.940 --> 01:52:10.810
<v Speaker 3>you don't have any data,</v>

3745
01:52:10.990 --> 01:52:12.970
<v Speaker 3>so if you don't have any data then you've got to go.</v>

3746
01:52:13.060 --> 01:52:14.680
<v Speaker 3>How you banning people for this.</v>

3747
01:52:14.710 --> 01:52:17.320
<v Speaker 3>Like ronda rousey fucking went off today.</v>

3748
01:52:17.321 --> 01:52:18.154
<v Speaker 3>It was watched.</v>

3749
01:52:18.250 --> 01:52:19.000
<v Speaker 3>I watched that clip.</v>

3750
01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:23.710
<v Speaker 3>She went off and drop the mic after it was over and one of the things that she</v>

3751
01:52:23.711 --> 01:52:26.110
<v Speaker 3>said I totally agree with about marijuana.</v>

3752
01:52:26.111 --> 01:52:27.250
<v Speaker 3>She said this in the past too,</v>

3753
01:52:27.310 --> 01:52:29.680
<v Speaker 3>it's an invasion of privacy is what it is.</v>

3754
01:52:29.950 --> 01:52:31.720
<v Speaker 3>You're invading someone's privacy.</v>

3755
01:52:31.930 --> 01:52:33.540
<v Speaker 3>Just like the fact that if you're.</v>

3756
01:52:33.580 --> 01:52:38.580
<v Speaker 3>If you work for a company and the company decides to test you and you work all</v>

3757
01:52:39.131 --> 01:52:39.401
<v Speaker 3>week,</v>

3758
01:52:39.401 --> 01:52:40.390
<v Speaker 3>you do a great job,</v>

3759
01:52:40.391 --> 01:52:41.224
<v Speaker 3>you work hard,</v>

3760
01:52:41.380 --> 01:52:42.630
<v Speaker 3>and then fridays,</v>

3761
01:52:42.870 --> 01:52:44.470
<v Speaker 3>since 5:00 baby,</v>

3762
01:52:44.471 --> 01:52:45.304
<v Speaker 3>it's over.</v>

3763
01:52:45.350 --> 01:52:46.490
<v Speaker 3>You want to smoke a joint,</v>

3764
01:52:46.491 --> 01:52:47.210
<v Speaker 3>your home,</v>

3765
01:52:47.210 --> 01:52:48.170
<v Speaker 3>you worked all day.</v>

3766
01:52:48.171 --> 01:52:49.730
<v Speaker 3>You want to watch the walking dead.</v>

3767
01:52:49.770 --> 01:52:51.740
<v Speaker 3>You want to put your feet up and you want to get high.</v>

3768
01:52:52.190 --> 01:52:53.023
<v Speaker 3>You can't.</v>

3769
01:52:53.120 --> 01:52:55.040
<v Speaker 3>You fucking can because they own you.</v>

3770
01:52:55.220 --> 01:52:56.090
<v Speaker 3>They own you.</v>

3771
01:52:56.091 --> 01:52:57.410
<v Speaker 3>They own your flesh.</v>

3772
01:52:57.530 --> 01:53:01.550
<v Speaker 3>They literally own your mind when you're not there because everyone knows that</v>

3773
01:53:01.551 --> 01:53:03.890
<v Speaker 3>marijuana is not psychoactive permanently.</v>

3774
01:53:04.100 --> 01:53:07.730
<v Speaker 3>It's not like you smoke a joint on friday and then you show up on monday</v>

3775
01:53:07.730 --> 01:53:07.731
<v Speaker 3>morning.</v>

3776
01:53:07.731 --> 01:53:10.130
<v Speaker 3>You're still high as fuck and you're high for the rest of your life.</v>

3777
01:53:10.340 --> 01:53:11.300
<v Speaker 3>That's not the case.</v>

3778
01:53:11.510 --> 01:53:12.291
<v Speaker 3>So if you,</v>

3779
01:53:12.291 --> 01:53:13.070
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

3780
01:53:13.070 --> 01:53:14.120
<v Speaker 3>if you smoke pot,</v>

3781
01:53:14.480 --> 01:53:17.360
<v Speaker 3>you will be tested four or five weeks from now,</v>

3782
01:53:17.361 --> 01:53:19.040
<v Speaker 3>you will still test positive.</v>

3783
01:53:19.580 --> 01:53:21.470
<v Speaker 3>If you don't smoke any pot,</v>

3784
01:53:21.471 --> 01:53:25.280
<v Speaker 3>if you get high right now and then four weeks from now they give you a</v>

3785
01:53:25.281 --> 01:53:26.091
<v Speaker 3>urinalysis test,</v>

3786
01:53:26.091 --> 01:53:27.320
<v Speaker 3>depending on what they're looking for.</v>

3787
01:53:27.321 --> 01:53:29.000
<v Speaker 3>If they're just trying to trace metabolites,</v>

3788
01:53:29.210 --> 01:53:31.160
<v Speaker 3>you can still test positive and four weeks,</v>

3789
01:53:31.310 --> 01:53:32.930
<v Speaker 3>that's fucking insane.</v>

3790
01:53:33.070 --> 01:53:33.720
<v Speaker 3>So it is.</v>

3791
01:53:33.720 --> 01:53:35.030
<v Speaker 3>It's simply a control thing.</v>

3792
01:53:35.031 --> 01:53:35.690
<v Speaker 3>It's a power thing.</v>

3793
01:53:35.690 --> 01:53:36.523
<v Speaker 3>It's a power thing.</v>

3794
01:53:36.530 --> 01:53:40.070
<v Speaker 3>These people or government people or government people that like to be able to</v>

3795
01:53:40.071 --> 01:53:40.970
<v Speaker 3>tell people what to do.</v>

3796
01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:42.200
<v Speaker 3>That's my concern though,</v>

3797
01:53:42.201 --> 01:53:43.460
<v Speaker 3>is if it's a power thing,</v>

3798
01:53:43.760 --> 01:53:44.810
<v Speaker 3>how deep is it?</v>

3799
01:53:44.811 --> 01:53:46.790
<v Speaker 3>How many levels does it go to?</v>

3800
01:53:46.850 --> 01:53:50.000
<v Speaker 3>How many judges are friends would not admit should find out.</v>

3801
01:53:50.240 --> 01:53:50.541
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3802
01:53:50.541 --> 01:53:52.220
<v Speaker 3>well they probably already on the case,</v>

3803
01:53:52.430 --> 01:53:54.650
<v Speaker 3>but ultimately I hope they're on the case.</v>

3804
01:53:54.860 --> 01:53:58.130
<v Speaker 3>Ultimately autonomous catholic public outcry.</v>

3805
01:53:58.190 --> 01:53:58.371
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

3806
01:53:58.371 --> 01:53:59.330
<v Speaker 3>this is a tyranny.</v>

3807
01:53:59.570 --> 01:54:03.530
<v Speaker 3>These are a few people that are deciding which again,</v>

3808
01:54:03.531 --> 01:54:05.840
<v Speaker 3>we're not talking about steroids here,</v>

3809
01:54:06.080 --> 01:54:07.490
<v Speaker 3>we're just talking about pot.</v>

3810
01:54:07.520 --> 01:54:08.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3811
01:54:08.060 --> 01:54:09.110
<v Speaker 3>it just doesn't make sense.</v>

3812
01:54:09.140 --> 01:54:14.140
<v Speaker 3>And we're also talking about a guy who passed to world anti doping agency tests.</v>

3813
01:54:16.520 --> 01:54:19.700
<v Speaker 3>Those are the most trick fucking tests in the world of sports.</v>

3814
01:54:20.030 --> 01:54:22.490
<v Speaker 3>He passed two of those and failed a quest.</v>

3815
01:54:22.491 --> 01:54:23.480
<v Speaker 3>I think quest,</v>

3816
01:54:23.900 --> 01:54:24.660
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

3817
01:54:24.660 --> 01:54:25.910
<v Speaker 3>I apologize from wrong,</v>

3818
01:54:26.180 --> 01:54:30.740
<v Speaker 3>but the bottom line is the tests were not the test that you need when you're</v>

3819
01:54:30.741 --> 01:54:35.741
<v Speaker 3>taking away a guy's fucking livelihood and you're finding him for $165,000 out</v>

3820
01:54:35.751 --> 01:54:37.220
<v Speaker 3>of a $500,000 purse,</v>

3821
01:54:37.370 --> 01:54:38.240
<v Speaker 3>which by the way,</v>

3822
01:54:38.300 --> 01:54:39.830
<v Speaker 3>he has to pay his managers.</v>

3823
01:54:39.830 --> 01:54:41.150
<v Speaker 3>He has to pay taxes.</v>

3824
01:54:41.151 --> 01:54:42.650
<v Speaker 3>He has to be all these different things.</v>

3825
01:54:42.830 --> 01:54:44.480
<v Speaker 3>When you make 500 grand,</v>

3826
01:54:44.660 --> 01:54:47.270
<v Speaker 3>you don't make 500 grand because you have a manager,</v>

3827
01:54:47.271 --> 01:54:48.450
<v Speaker 3>the manager has 10 percent.</v>

3828
01:54:48.690 --> 01:54:50.600
<v Speaker 3>You might have an agent and the agent gets a piece.</v>

3829
01:54:50.900 --> 01:54:51.830
<v Speaker 3>You might have a lawyer,</v>

3830
01:54:51.831 --> 01:54:53.150
<v Speaker 3>you might have a business manager,</v>

3831
01:54:53.151 --> 01:54:53.870
<v Speaker 3>you might have.</v>

3832
01:54:53.870 --> 01:54:54.980
<v Speaker 3>You have to pay taxes.</v>

3833
01:54:55.100 --> 01:54:55.900
<v Speaker 3>You have training,</v>

3834
01:54:55.900 --> 01:54:57.130
<v Speaker 3>expensive training partners.</v>

3835
01:54:57.720 --> 01:55:02.090
<v Speaker 3>You mean you have to be very strict and nick is notoriously disciplined with his</v>

3836
01:55:02.091 --> 01:55:02.870
<v Speaker 3>diet.</v>

3837
01:55:02.870 --> 01:55:03.470
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's.</v>

3838
01:55:03.470 --> 01:55:05.120
<v Speaker 3>He eats all organic food.</v>

3839
01:55:05.140 --> 01:55:06.410
<v Speaker 3>He's mostly vegan,</v>

3840
01:55:06.411 --> 01:55:07.910
<v Speaker 3>except I think he eats some fish.</v>

3841
01:55:08.060 --> 01:55:12.710
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't need any land animals and he does this based on the effect on his</v>

3842
01:55:12.711 --> 01:55:15.140
<v Speaker 3>body because he's an extreme endurance athlete.</v>

3843
01:55:15.141 --> 01:55:18.350
<v Speaker 3>He does a lot of triathlons and he does a lot of running.</v>

3844
01:55:18.351 --> 01:55:20.960
<v Speaker 3>He swam back and forth from alcatraz twice.</v>

3845
01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:22.550
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's a motherfucker dude.</v>

3846
01:55:22.550 --> 01:55:25.940
<v Speaker 3>He takes care of his body and if he's smoking pot,</v>

3847
01:55:26.060 --> 01:55:28.160
<v Speaker 3>that should tell you the pot's not bad for your body.</v>

3848
01:55:28.790 --> 01:55:29.750
<v Speaker 3>It's real simple,</v>

3849
01:55:30.110 --> 01:55:31.220
<v Speaker 3>but he's not cheating.</v>

3850
01:55:31.400 --> 01:55:32.810
<v Speaker 3>He's not doing steroids.</v>

3851
01:55:32.870 --> 01:55:34.850
<v Speaker 3>He's not doing anything that gives them an unfair advantage.</v>

3852
01:55:34.851 --> 01:55:35.780
<v Speaker 3>He's working hard.</v>

3853
01:55:35.870 --> 01:55:36.950
<v Speaker 3>He's tough as shit.</v>

3854
01:55:37.160 --> 01:55:40.790
<v Speaker 3>Any fucking fight smart and these assholes.</v>

3855
01:55:40.880 --> 01:55:45.240
<v Speaker 3>They stole his ability to entertain and he's one of the most popular guys in the</v>

3856
01:55:45.241 --> 01:55:46.074
<v Speaker 3>fucking sport.</v>

3857
01:55:46.200 --> 01:55:48.120
<v Speaker 3>When he came back and fought anderson silva,</v>

3858
01:55:48.270 --> 01:55:50.280
<v Speaker 3>the paper view was through the roof.</v>

3859
01:55:50.400 --> 01:55:51.420
<v Speaker 3>And why was that?</v>

3860
01:55:51.720 --> 01:55:51.901
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3861
01:55:51.901 --> 01:55:55.110
<v Speaker 3>partly because when people want to see what anderson silva would look like after</v>

3862
01:55:55.111 --> 01:55:56.580
<v Speaker 3>he came back from a leg injury,</v>

3863
01:55:56.820 --> 01:55:58.020
<v Speaker 3>this horrific leg break,</v>

3864
01:55:58.140 --> 01:56:00.180
<v Speaker 3>but also it's because he's fighting nick diaz,</v>

3865
01:56:00.690 --> 01:56:01.110
<v Speaker 3>nick diaz,</v>

3866
01:56:01.110 --> 01:56:02.160
<v Speaker 3>gonna talk shit to him.</v>

3867
01:56:02.161 --> 01:56:02.994
<v Speaker 3>Like he did,</v>

3868
01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:04.020
<v Speaker 3>like he got in his face.</v>

3869
01:56:04.021 --> 01:56:04.291
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

3870
01:56:04.291 --> 01:56:04.830
<v Speaker 3>what bitch?</v>

3871
01:56:04.830 --> 01:56:05.430
<v Speaker 3>What bitch?</v>

3872
01:56:05.430 --> 01:56:08.940
<v Speaker 3>Like nobody ever done that to anderson silva before he laid down on the ground</v>

3873
01:56:08.941 --> 01:56:10.500
<v Speaker 3>like he was making a sleepy face like,</v>

3874
01:56:10.501 --> 01:56:10.711
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

3875
01:56:10.711 --> 01:56:12.330
<v Speaker 3>I'm sleep and you're boring the fuck out of me,</v>

3876
01:56:12.600 --> 01:56:13.650
<v Speaker 3>and jumped back up to his feet.</v>

3877
01:56:13.651 --> 01:56:17.490
<v Speaker 3>He humiliated anderson completely fucked with his head inside that cage.</v>

3878
01:56:17.700 --> 01:56:22.700
<v Speaker 3>That's what people paid for and what he is experiencing right now is a bunch of</v>

3879
01:56:23.671 --> 01:56:26.070
<v Speaker 3>assholes taken away his ability to compete,</v>

3880
01:56:26.220 --> 01:56:31.220
<v Speaker 3>taken away his ability to thrill people at what he does best has worked for more</v>

3881
01:56:32.490 --> 01:56:34.440
<v Speaker 3>than a fucking decade as a professional mixed martial arts fighter.</v>

3882
01:56:34.740 --> 01:56:38.550
<v Speaker 3>More than a dad who knows how many years before that training and learning how</v>

3883
01:56:38.551 --> 01:56:41.250
<v Speaker 3>to fight all that's taken away by some assholes.</v>

3884
01:56:41.820 --> 01:56:42.930
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's going to stick it all.</v>

3885
01:56:43.110 --> 01:56:44.340
<v Speaker 3>It's not going to stick to.</v>

3886
01:56:44.530 --> 01:56:47.190
<v Speaker 3>I hope the the what the outcome is,</v>

3887
01:56:47.340 --> 01:56:51.150
<v Speaker 3>is that we realized that these people are just bad at what they do and they get</v>

3888
01:56:51.151 --> 01:56:51.601
<v Speaker 3>removed.</v>

3889
01:56:51.601 --> 01:56:51.871
<v Speaker 3>Kevin,</v>

3890
01:56:51.871 --> 01:56:53.760
<v Speaker 3>I only wrote a fantastic piece about it.</v>

3891
01:56:53.990 --> 01:56:54.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm kevin.</v>

3892
01:56:54.790 --> 01:56:57.300
<v Speaker 3>I who's a very respected sports reporter.</v>

3893
01:56:57.600 --> 01:56:58.210
<v Speaker 3>I forget what,</v>

3894
01:56:58.210 --> 01:56:59.670
<v Speaker 3>what publication he writes for,</v>

3895
01:56:59.671 --> 01:57:02.100
<v Speaker 3>but he's very respected in the world of combat sports especially.</v>

3896
01:57:02.310 --> 01:57:05.010
<v Speaker 3>He said they expose themselves as being ridiculous.</v>

3897
01:57:05.310 --> 01:57:06.990
<v Speaker 3>They expose themselves being incompetent.</v>

3898
01:57:07.380 --> 01:57:07.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3899
01:57:07.710 --> 01:57:08.071
<v Speaker 2>It's like a.</v>

3900
01:57:08.071 --> 01:57:12.840
<v Speaker 2>It's like it takes a critical moment like this to get everybody motivated enough</v>

3901
01:57:12.841 --> 01:57:14.640
<v Speaker 2>to actually incite some change.</v>

3902
01:57:14.670 --> 01:57:14.970
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

3903
01:57:14.970 --> 01:57:16.110
<v Speaker 2>It made me so angry,</v>

3904
01:57:16.111 --> 01:57:16.470
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

3905
01:57:16.470 --> 01:57:17.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3906
01:57:17.220 --> 01:57:18.053
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen.</v>

3907
01:57:18.090 --> 01:57:19.710
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen this kind of reaction.</v>

3908
01:57:20.190 --> 01:57:22.350
<v Speaker 2>Not that I can remember since the lion killer.</v>

3909
01:57:22.780 --> 01:57:23.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3910
01:57:23.610 --> 01:57:24.443
<v Speaker 2>This is like the,</v>

3911
01:57:26.300 --> 01:57:27.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3912
01:57:27.010 --> 01:57:29.520
<v Speaker 2>the other side of the thing,</v>

3913
01:57:29.521 --> 01:57:30.000
<v Speaker 2>because it's.</v>

3914
01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:30.590
<v Speaker 2>This is a.</v>

3915
01:57:30.590 --> 01:57:33.170
<v Speaker 2>Most people would taking social media,</v>

3916
01:57:33.820 --> 01:57:36.460
<v Speaker 2>but the way that joe is talking about here is,</v>

3917
01:57:36.510 --> 01:57:36.870
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

3918
01:57:36.870 --> 01:57:37.890
<v Speaker 2>is measured,</v>

3919
01:57:38.070 --> 01:57:38.341
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3920
01:57:38.341 --> 01:57:41.820
<v Speaker 2>He's not saying go to these people's homes and torture their children.</v>

3921
01:57:41.840 --> 01:57:42.330
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3922
01:57:42.330 --> 01:57:46.200
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem is that like this stuff gets misconstrued.</v>

3923
01:57:46.201 --> 01:57:48.210
<v Speaker 2>Like getting back to the lion killer thing is like,</v>

3924
01:57:48.660 --> 01:57:49.291
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

3925
01:57:49.291 --> 01:57:50.340
<v Speaker 2>be motivated,</v>

3926
01:57:50.820 --> 01:57:52.080
<v Speaker 2>but be smart about it.</v>

3927
01:57:52.170 --> 01:57:53.003
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3928
01:57:53.010 --> 01:57:53.843
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3929
01:57:54.200 --> 01:57:56.370
<v Speaker 2>it's also the thing that we were talking about before.</v>

3930
01:57:56.400 --> 01:57:57.090
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

3931
01:57:57.090 --> 01:57:57.930
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right though.</v>

3932
01:57:57.931 --> 01:57:59.250
<v Speaker 2>It does bring it full circle.</v>

3933
01:57:59.330 --> 01:58:03.150
<v Speaker 2>It's like this highlights what's good about being able to express themselves</v>

3934
01:58:03.430 --> 01:58:08.430
<v Speaker 3>and it also highlights how these established sort of structures they operate on</v>

3935
01:58:08.441 --> 01:58:11.830
<v Speaker 3>this old paradigm and they haven't caught up to the new paradigm yet.</v>

3936
01:58:11.831 --> 01:58:15.280
<v Speaker 3>They don't understand that this is not going to end like this whole nick diaz</v>

3937
01:58:15.281 --> 01:58:16.660
<v Speaker 3>thing and the vandelay silva thing.</v>

3938
01:58:16.810 --> 01:58:19.360
<v Speaker 3>You've got to legends of the sport that you've fucked.</v>

3939
01:58:19.600 --> 01:58:20.590
<v Speaker 3>You fucked over,</v>

3940
01:58:20.920 --> 01:58:21.281
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3941
01:58:21.281 --> 01:58:25.480
<v Speaker 3>and there's one thing also when people are injured and they're taking things to</v>

3942
01:58:25.481 --> 01:58:26.410
<v Speaker 3>help them recover.</v>

3943
01:58:27.040 --> 01:58:27.460
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>

3944
01:58:27.460 --> 01:58:28.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm not against that.</v>

3945
01:58:28.541 --> 01:58:29.374
<v Speaker 3>I'm just not.</v>

3946
01:58:29.410 --> 01:58:29.951
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>

3947
01:58:29.951 --> 01:58:30.311
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3948
01:58:30.311 --> 01:58:31.000
<v Speaker 3>If a guy,</v>

3949
01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:32.440
<v Speaker 3>like there's certain things,</v>

3950
01:58:32.680 --> 01:58:37.090
<v Speaker 3>there's certain things that you can take that will help you recover from injury</v>

3951
01:58:37.100 --> 01:58:38.080
<v Speaker 3>that are absolutely illegal.</v>

3952
01:58:38.230 --> 01:58:38.411
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3953
01:58:38.411 --> 01:58:40.120
<v Speaker 3>here's one stem cells.</v>

3954
01:58:40.360 --> 01:58:40.691
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

3955
01:58:40.691 --> 01:58:42.160
<v Speaker 3>here's one that I have personal experience.</v>

3956
01:58:42.161 --> 01:58:43.030
<v Speaker 3>Are those uh,</v>

3957
01:58:43.060 --> 01:58:43.810
<v Speaker 3>outlawed yet?</v>

3958
01:58:43.810 --> 01:58:44.291
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3959
01:58:44.291 --> 01:58:44.950
<v Speaker 3>they're not.</v>

3960
01:58:44.950 --> 01:58:46.060
<v Speaker 3>But dude,</v>

3961
01:58:46.300 --> 01:58:47.470
<v Speaker 3>they fucking work.</v>

3962
01:58:47.770 --> 01:58:49.270
<v Speaker 3>They weren't to repair injuries.</v>

3963
01:58:49.271 --> 01:58:50.260
<v Speaker 3>They're incredible.</v>

3964
01:58:50.410 --> 01:58:50.651
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3965
01:58:50.651 --> 01:58:51.490
<v Speaker 3>it's incredible.</v>

3966
01:58:51.520 --> 01:58:51.701
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

3967
01:58:51.701 --> 01:58:53.530
<v Speaker 3>they can regenerate cartilage now.</v>

3968
01:58:53.920 --> 01:58:58.920
<v Speaker 3>So if you don't have access to stem cells and you're competing with someone who</v>

3969
01:58:58.991 --> 01:59:02.560
<v Speaker 3>does and this guy gets a stem cell injection on his knees and his knees are</v>

3970
01:59:02.561 --> 01:59:02.951
<v Speaker 3>fixed up,</v>

3971
01:59:02.951 --> 01:59:05.800
<v Speaker 3>so he's going to be able to train harder and you have to tough through it.</v>

3972
01:59:06.070 --> 01:59:07.360
<v Speaker 3>Well what should that be?</v>

3973
01:59:07.361 --> 01:59:11.920
<v Speaker 3>Legal or there's a similarity to that to people who get knee injuries or knee</v>

3974
01:59:11.921 --> 01:59:15.220
<v Speaker 3>surgeries and then take a steroid to help themselves repair,</v>

3975
01:59:15.280 --> 01:59:18.010
<v Speaker 3>repair quicker so they can get back to competing quicker.</v>

3976
01:59:18.040 --> 01:59:18.690
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3977
01:59:18.690 --> 01:59:22.910
<v Speaker 2>one of the fucked up things about this too is just looking at it surface level.</v>

3978
01:59:23.500 --> 01:59:24.260
<v Speaker 2>The these,</v>

3979
01:59:24.260 --> 01:59:28.640
<v Speaker 2>these dudes go out there and beat each other up for other people's</v>

3980
01:59:28.641 --> 01:59:29.474
<v Speaker 2>entertainment.</v>

3981
01:59:30.170 --> 01:59:31.160
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

3982
01:59:31.430 --> 01:59:33.860
<v Speaker 2>in that interview with diaz after the fact,</v>

3983
01:59:33.861 --> 01:59:37.640
<v Speaker 2>he was talking about how the people making decisions about what he can and can't</v>

3984
01:59:37.641 --> 01:59:38.091
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

3985
01:59:38.091 --> 01:59:41.960
<v Speaker 2>Those people sitting on the board or whatever the hell it is,</v>

3986
01:59:42.440 --> 01:59:44.450
<v Speaker 2>they don't have to experience that.</v>

3987
01:59:44.451 --> 01:59:44.871
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

3988
01:59:44.871 --> 01:59:49.250
<v Speaker 2>Like they're not in what you're saying as far as recovery is concerned.</v>

3989
01:59:49.251 --> 01:59:52.520
<v Speaker 2>It's like how can a regular person make a judgment on that?</v>

3990
01:59:52.600 --> 01:59:57.050
<v Speaker 2>And coming back to the thing about having a union fighters are the only people</v>

3991
01:59:57.080 --> 01:59:59.060
<v Speaker 2>who should be making decisions about fighters,</v>

3992
01:59:59.110 --> 01:59:59.920
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3993
01:59:59.920 --> 02:00:04.160
<v Speaker 3>Like most fighters feel very strongly that you shouldn't be able to use</v>

3994
02:00:04.430 --> 02:00:06.320
<v Speaker 3>performance enhancing drugs and compete.</v>

3995
02:00:06.321 --> 02:00:09.080
<v Speaker 3>And rhonda has said this very clearly.</v>

3996
02:00:09.270 --> 02:00:09.590
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3997
02:00:09.590 --> 02:00:10.151
<v Speaker 3>and she,</v>

3998
02:00:10.151 --> 02:00:13.310
<v Speaker 3>she says something I totally agree with the difference between this and any</v>

3999
02:00:13.311 --> 02:00:16.490
<v Speaker 3>other sport is if you give a guy steroids and he plays baseball,</v>

4000
02:00:16.910 --> 02:00:17.780
<v Speaker 3>what's the big deal?</v>

4001
02:00:17.870 --> 02:00:19.040
<v Speaker 3>He's just going to hit a ball better.</v>

4002
02:00:19.280 --> 02:00:21.560
<v Speaker 3>But if you give a guy steroids and you let them fight,</v>

4003
02:00:21.650 --> 02:00:24.950
<v Speaker 3>he could administer damage that maybe he would not have been able to administer.</v>

4004
02:00:24.951 --> 02:00:28.130
<v Speaker 3>He could hurt someone that maybe he wouldn't have had the endurance to her.</v>

4005
02:00:28.310 --> 02:00:31.100
<v Speaker 3>He wouldn't have been able to deliver the combination that wound up hurting this</v>

4006
02:00:31.101 --> 02:00:31.911
<v Speaker 3>person very badly.</v>

4007
02:00:31.911 --> 02:00:33.800
<v Speaker 3>Or possibly even killing someone.</v>

4008
02:00:34.100 --> 02:00:38.810
<v Speaker 3>And she said that if someone ever does die and the other person tests positive</v>

4009
02:00:38.811 --> 02:00:39.620
<v Speaker 3>for steroids,</v>

4010
02:00:39.620 --> 02:00:40.190
<v Speaker 3>they should,</v>

4011
02:00:40.190 --> 02:00:41.930
<v Speaker 3>they should really get charged with murder.</v>

4012
02:00:42.230 --> 02:00:43.063
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4013
02:00:43.190 --> 02:00:43.581
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4014
02:00:43.581 --> 02:00:45.500
<v Speaker 3>but I mean why it kind of does.</v>

4015
02:00:45.501 --> 02:00:46.310
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

4016
02:00:46.310 --> 02:00:47.480
<v Speaker 3>I don't know about that.</v>

4017
02:00:47.640 --> 02:00:48.680
<v Speaker 3>I don't know about that either.</v>

4018
02:00:48.681 --> 02:00:50.930
<v Speaker 3>But there's a fine line and I just think,</v>

4019
02:00:50.960 --> 02:00:55.160
<v Speaker 3>I just think it's so hard to put yourself in the person's shoes that's</v>

4020
02:00:55.161 --> 02:00:55.860
<v Speaker 3>competing.</v>

4021
02:00:55.860 --> 02:00:56.660
<v Speaker 3>Like for me,</v>

4022
02:00:56.660 --> 02:00:57.440
<v Speaker 3>for me,</v>

4023
02:00:57.440 --> 02:00:58.930
<v Speaker 3>I don't have somebody</v>

4024
02:00:59.350 --> 02:01:03.280
<v Speaker 2>trying to knock my fucking head off and if that was going to work for me,</v>

4025
02:01:03.700 --> 02:01:08.650
<v Speaker 2>I just feel like that you need different kind of set of rules agreed upon by the</v>

4026
02:01:08.651 --> 02:01:10.320
<v Speaker 2>person you're about to step in there with.</v>

4027
02:01:10.730 --> 02:01:12.740
<v Speaker 3>That's an interesting way of looking at it.</v>

4028
02:01:12.741 --> 02:01:13.790
<v Speaker 3>And I agree with that as well.</v>

4029
02:01:13.791 --> 02:01:18.030
<v Speaker 3>Like say if you guys were going to fight and you made an agreement that we're</v>

4030
02:01:18.060 --> 02:01:19.480
<v Speaker 3>both going to be juicy juice.</v>

4031
02:01:19.500 --> 02:01:20.030
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

4032
02:01:20.030 --> 02:01:20.900
<v Speaker 3>You should be able to do that.</v>

4033
02:01:20.960 --> 02:01:21.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4034
02:01:21.380 --> 02:01:22.520
<v Speaker 3>I think I agree with that.</v>

4035
02:01:22.550 --> 02:01:23.060
<v Speaker 3>And we.</v>

4036
02:01:23.060 --> 02:01:23.960
<v Speaker 3>And we could write.</v>

4037
02:01:23.961 --> 02:01:24.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4038
02:01:24.320 --> 02:01:24.800
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4039
02:01:24.800 --> 02:01:25.490
<v Speaker 3>it's not legal.</v>

4040
02:01:25.490 --> 02:01:25.641
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4041
02:01:25.641 --> 02:01:26.090
<v Speaker 3>not in.</v>

4042
02:01:26.090 --> 02:01:26.440
<v Speaker 3>Not,</v>

4043
02:01:26.440 --> 02:01:27.170
<v Speaker 3>not.</v>

4044
02:01:27.170 --> 02:01:27.830
<v Speaker 3>Not on a page.</v>

4045
02:01:27.830 --> 02:01:29.010
<v Speaker 3>Not in the United States.</v>

4046
02:01:29.690 --> 02:01:30.710
<v Speaker 3>The island though.</v>

4047
02:01:32.710 --> 02:01:37.250
<v Speaker 3>The next thing for fucking buy an island.</v>

4048
02:01:39.130 --> 02:01:39.963
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4049
02:01:40.910 --> 02:01:42.800
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what was it?</v>

4050
02:01:42.801 --> 02:01:46.630
<v Speaker 1>That podcast with the floating countries.</v>

02:01:47.201 --> 02:01:48.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4054
02:01:48.080 --> 02:01:48.861
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

4055
02:01:48.861 --> 02:01:52.220
<v Speaker 1>These guys are want to be a barge off the coast.</v>

4056
02:01:52.250 --> 02:01:53.390
<v Speaker 1>What do they call that shit again?</v>

4057
02:01:53.630 --> 02:01:54.860
<v Speaker 1>Seasteading seasteading.</v>

4058
02:01:54.861 --> 02:01:55.340
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

4059
02:01:55.340 --> 02:01:56.060
<v Speaker 1>That's what it was.</v>

4060
02:01:56.060 --> 02:01:56.490
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

4061
02:01:56.490 --> 02:01:56.930
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

4062
02:01:56.930 --> 02:01:58.160
<v Speaker 1>That's totally true.</v>

4063
02:01:58.700 --> 02:01:59.540
<v Speaker 1>That's totally true.</v>

4064
02:01:59.541 --> 02:02:04.130
<v Speaker 1>They need to have seasteading fights just off the coast of catalina and fucking</v>

4065
02:02:04.131 --> 02:02:04.970
<v Speaker 1>they duke it out.</v>

4066
02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:05.930
<v Speaker 1>All juiced up.</v>

4067
02:02:05.960 --> 02:02:10.100
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's 190 fucking percent testosterone free hookers in the audience.</v>

4068
02:02:10.130 --> 02:02:10.941
<v Speaker 1>Sounds exciting.</v>

4069
02:02:10.941 --> 02:02:12.440
<v Speaker 1>Show how much you paid and get in there.</v>

4070
02:02:12.670 --> 02:02:13.280
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't ours.</v>

4071
02:02:13.280 --> 02:02:13.790
<v Speaker 1>A ticket.</v>

4072
02:02:13.790 --> 02:02:14.110
<v Speaker 1>That's a.</v>

4073
02:02:14.110 --> 02:02:14.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4074
02:02:14.510 --> 02:02:15.343
<v Speaker 1>that's not enough.</v>

4075
02:02:15.770 --> 02:02:16.610
<v Speaker 1>These hookers are good.</v>

4076
02:02:17.090 --> 02:02:19.310
<v Speaker 1>That's not enough money to pay for the ticket.</v>

4077
02:02:19.311 --> 02:02:20.180
<v Speaker 1>If they're all free,</v>

4078
02:02:20.660 --> 02:02:22.000
<v Speaker 1>how much these girls going to get paid?</v>

4079
02:02:22.490 --> 02:02:23.450
<v Speaker 1>They just want to be on the island.</v>

4080
02:02:23.990 --> 02:02:25.350
<v Speaker 1>This agree,</v>

4081
02:02:25.980 --> 02:02:28.070
<v Speaker 1>but I think in bringing it full circle,</v>

4082
02:02:28.250 --> 02:02:33.250
<v Speaker 1>what we're exposing here is that this ability to communicate about things,</v>

4083
02:02:33.530 --> 02:02:34.610
<v Speaker 1>it's changing.</v>

4084
02:02:34.610 --> 02:02:37.500
<v Speaker 1>It's changing radically than anybody has a say.</v>

4085
02:02:37.501 --> 02:02:38.180
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

4086
02:02:38.180 --> 02:02:39.740
<v Speaker 1>like literally anybody,</v>

4087
02:02:39.741 --> 02:02:42.620
<v Speaker 1>no matter you're not vetted out based on your intelligence,</v>

4088
02:02:42.860 --> 02:02:45.350
<v Speaker 1>you're not judged beforehand,</v>

4089
02:02:45.351 --> 02:02:48.320
<v Speaker 1>you're not screened is anybody can just scream out.</v>

4090
02:02:48.530 --> 02:02:48.741
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

4091
02:02:48.741 --> 02:02:52.580
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend who goes and reads comments on his stuff and he gets all upset.</v>

4092
02:02:52.581 --> 02:02:52.731
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

4093
02:02:52.731 --> 02:02:54.390
<v Speaker 1>you're getting upset at people you don't even know.</v>

4094
02:02:54.420 --> 02:02:54.621
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4095
02:02:54.621 --> 02:02:54.790
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4096
02:02:54.790 --> 02:02:55.000
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

4097
02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.650
<v Speaker 1>You were allowing these people into your head and like they're saying,</v>

4098
02:02:57.651 --> 02:02:59.510
<v Speaker 1>these people say idiotic things and he gets upset.</v>

4099
02:02:59.520 --> 02:02:59.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

4100
02:02:59.730 --> 02:03:00.450
<v Speaker 1>of course they're gonna.</v>

4101
02:03:00.450 --> 02:03:01.281
<v Speaker 1>Say idiotic things.</v>

4102
02:03:01.281 --> 02:03:02.114
<v Speaker 1>They're idiots.</v>

4103
02:03:02.300 --> 02:03:03.410
<v Speaker 1>Do you hang out with idiots?</v>

4104
02:03:03.560 --> 02:03:03.951
<v Speaker 1>Will listen,</v>

4105
02:03:03.951 --> 02:03:04.130
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4106
02:03:04.130 --> 02:03:06.680
<v Speaker 1>If you go to idiots houses and start asking them questions,</v>

4107
02:03:06.860 --> 02:03:09.500
<v Speaker 1>we're going to say some shit you disagree with or you gonna argue with them all</v>

4108
02:03:09.500 --> 02:03:09.710
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

4109
02:03:09.710 --> 02:03:10.640
<v Speaker 1>You won't have a life.</v>

4110
02:03:10.700 --> 02:03:13.460
<v Speaker 1>You don't have enough time in the day to pay attention.</v>

4111
02:03:13.820 --> 02:03:14.960
<v Speaker 1>Look at yourself,</v>

4112
02:03:15.020 --> 02:03:15.980
<v Speaker 1>make your own job.</v>

4113
02:03:15.981 --> 02:03:18.140
<v Speaker 1>He'd be honest and be self objective.</v>

4114
02:03:18.320 --> 02:03:22.610
<v Speaker 1>Make your own sort of analysis of the pros and cons of your behavior and your</v>

4115
02:03:22.611 --> 02:03:23.444
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>

4116
02:03:23.480 --> 02:03:25.700
<v Speaker 1>and then if they disagree with that,</v>

4117
02:03:25.730 --> 02:03:28.250
<v Speaker 1>you kind of have at least some sort of an idea,</v>

4118
02:03:28.730 --> 02:03:29.271
<v Speaker 1>but you don't.</v>

4119
02:03:29.271 --> 02:03:30.710
<v Speaker 1>You don't have that idea on the internet.</v>

4120
02:03:31.010 --> 02:03:31.251
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

4121
02:03:31.251 --> 02:03:32.240
<v Speaker 1>because you just,</v>

4122
02:03:32.330 --> 02:03:34.100
<v Speaker 1>you all you see is text.</v>

4123
02:03:34.280 --> 02:03:37.510
<v Speaker 1>You don't see the person's life behind that text.</v>

4124
02:03:37.520 --> 02:03:40.460
<v Speaker 1>You don't see what a fuck up they've been their whole life.</v>

4125
02:03:40.970 --> 02:03:43.160
<v Speaker 1>That's allowed them to be lacking context.</v>

4126
02:03:43.161 --> 02:03:44.510
<v Speaker 1>You don't see that they're 12</v>

4127
02:03:46.960 --> 02:03:47.793
<v Speaker 1>fucking,</v>

4128
02:03:48.800 --> 02:03:49.131
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

4129
02:03:49.131 --> 02:03:51.080
<v Speaker 1>That's another thing to take into consideration.</v>

4130
02:03:51.100 --> 02:03:52.700
<v Speaker 1>Wonder like what the effect of it,</v>

4131
02:03:52.910 --> 02:03:54.770
<v Speaker 1>if like let's say for example,</v>

4132
02:03:54.860 --> 02:03:57.620
<v Speaker 1>I had access to the same stuff when I was 12.</v>

4133
02:03:57.621 --> 02:03:57.791
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

4134
02:03:57.791 --> 02:04:01.040
<v Speaker 1>I have been the same asshole probably I think I would,</v>

4135
02:04:01.140 --> 02:04:02.790
<v Speaker 1>I was an angry kid if I,</v>

4136
02:04:02.791 --> 02:04:03.900
<v Speaker 1>if I was um,</v>

4137
02:04:04.470 --> 02:04:08.450
<v Speaker 1>if I was able to for whatever reason get upset about something that I felt like</v>

4138
02:04:08.480 --> 02:04:10.130
<v Speaker 1>it's somewhere that it would be justified.</v>

4139
02:04:10.400 --> 02:04:10.761
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>

4140
02:04:10.761 --> 02:04:14.840
<v Speaker 1>my anger wouldn't have really been directed towards what I was getting upset</v>

4141
02:04:14.841 --> 02:04:15.171
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

4142
02:04:15.171 --> 02:04:18.320
<v Speaker 1>They would have just given me the green light to express some of the anger that</v>

4143
02:04:18.321 --> 02:04:19.610
<v Speaker 1>I had about my own life.</v>

4144
02:04:20.150 --> 02:04:20.690
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4145
02:04:20.690 --> 02:04:21.021
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

4146
02:04:21.021 --> 02:04:22.970
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a lot of what we're dealing with you.</v>

4147
02:04:23.040 --> 02:04:26.180
<v Speaker 1>I think it just a manifests itself in these various causes,</v>

4148
02:04:26.320 --> 02:04:26.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4149
02:04:26.560 --> 02:04:27.440
<v Speaker 1>like days that you,</v>

4150
02:04:27.441 --> 02:04:31.790
<v Speaker 1>like you said before it is that people are not all that happy about their own</v>

4151
02:04:31.791 --> 02:04:33.050
<v Speaker 1>personal situation,</v>

4152
02:04:33.470 --> 02:04:38.070
<v Speaker 1>but it's a lot easier to latch on to conflict that someone has sort</v>

4153
02:04:38.070 --> 02:04:42.810
<v Speaker 2>of shaped for you than it is to necessarily tackle the super personal thing that</v>

4154
02:04:42.811 --> 02:04:43.590
<v Speaker 2>you're upset with.</v>

4155
02:04:43.590 --> 02:04:43.831
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4156
02:04:43.831 --> 02:04:48.690
<v Speaker 2>Or get your life to a point of balance where you can actually look at anything</v>

4157
02:04:48.691 --> 02:04:53.250
<v Speaker 2>that's going on in the world and have just sort of an intelligent well,</v>

4158
02:04:53.251 --> 02:04:53.541
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

4159
02:04:53.541 --> 02:04:53.881
<v Speaker 2>and that's.</v>

4160
02:04:53.881 --> 02:04:54.714
<v Speaker 2>And that's where I,</v>

4161
02:04:54.730 --> 02:04:58.050
<v Speaker 2>I think that even though this is the wild west and everyone has a voice,</v>

4162
02:04:58.260 --> 02:05:03.210
<v Speaker 2>there are obviously voices that have emerged as more prominent when communities</v>

4163
02:05:03.300 --> 02:05:08.300
<v Speaker 2>to communities and I think that that's where I still see a sense of</v>

4164
02:05:08.311 --> 02:05:12.990
<v Speaker 2>responsibility that k fine all you need is a smartphone in twitter to,</v>

4165
02:05:13.020 --> 02:05:15.050
<v Speaker 2>to say what you want but there,</v>

4166
02:05:15.140 --> 02:05:15.781
<v Speaker 2>but it's not.</v>

4167
02:05:15.781 --> 02:05:17.310
<v Speaker 2>The influence still exists.</v>

4168
02:05:17.311 --> 02:05:17.940
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

4169
02:05:17.940 --> 02:05:22.320
<v Speaker 2>And I feel like sometimes you'll witness influence being irresponsible.</v>

4170
02:05:22.890 --> 02:05:23.723
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4171
02:05:24.330 --> 02:05:25.260
<v Speaker 2>case in point.</v>

4172
02:05:25.470 --> 02:05:26.303
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>

4173
02:05:26.620 --> 02:05:27.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how people feel about this,</v>

4174
02:05:27.901 --> 02:05:30.120
<v Speaker 2>but like when jimmy kimmel was crying on the air,</v>

4175
02:05:31.060 --> 02:05:36.060
<v Speaker 2>like for me that's an abusive influence because he wasn't painting the entire</v>

4176
02:05:36.151 --> 02:05:36.510
<v Speaker 2>picture.</v>

4177
02:05:36.510 --> 02:05:37.960
<v Speaker 2>There he was,</v>

4178
02:05:38.040 --> 02:05:40.130
<v Speaker 2>he was picking his side in a,</v>

4179
02:05:40.140 --> 02:05:41.520
<v Speaker 2>in a very short form.</v>

4180
02:05:41.521 --> 02:05:42.181
<v Speaker 2>Little what was it,</v>

4181
02:05:42.181 --> 02:05:47.181
<v Speaker 2>two sentences and then showing that kind of a physical emotion associated with</v>

4182
02:05:47.491 --> 02:05:47.611
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

4183
02:05:47.611 --> 02:05:48.570
<v Speaker 2>That was fuel,</v>

4184
02:05:48.571 --> 02:05:49.170
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

4185
02:05:49.170 --> 02:05:49.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4186
02:05:49.860 --> 02:05:51.840
<v Speaker 2>Well that was his perspective though.</v>

4187
02:05:53.480 --> 02:05:54.810
<v Speaker 2>He's got a limited perspective.</v>

4188
02:05:54.811 --> 02:05:55.290
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

4189
02:05:55.290 --> 02:05:58.680
<v Speaker 2>you saw his perspective about video games and how offended people got about</v>

4190
02:05:58.681 --> 02:05:59.160
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

4191
02:05:59.160 --> 02:06:01.080
<v Speaker 2>They were calling in death threats against him,</v>

4192
02:06:01.340 --> 02:06:04.590
<v Speaker 2>which I found incredibly ironic after he defends the lion hunter.</v>

4193
02:06:04.920 --> 02:06:08.650
<v Speaker 2>Then he goes off about video games sport like fuck you.</v>

4194
02:06:09.750 --> 02:06:10.321
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying.</v>

4195
02:06:10.321 --> 02:06:10.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>

4196
02:06:10.860 --> 02:06:12.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying I agree with the video game guys.</v>

4197
02:06:13.140 --> 02:06:13.980
<v Speaker 2>It's a sport.</v>

4198
02:06:14.150 --> 02:06:14.983
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4199
02:06:15.060 --> 02:06:15.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm with.</v>

4200
02:06:15.530 --> 02:06:18.870
<v Speaker 2>So he's what he was doing by saying what by by mocking it.</v>

4201
02:06:18.871 --> 02:06:20.040
<v Speaker 2>I guess he's trying to do comedy,</v>

4202
02:06:20.041 --> 02:06:20.610
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

4203
02:06:20.610 --> 02:06:23.490
<v Speaker 2>he's being disrespectful to an emerging sport,</v>

4204
02:06:23.730 --> 02:06:28.730
<v Speaker 2>which is an unquestionably involves skill and intelligent planning and strategy</v>

4205
02:06:28.801 --> 02:06:29.580
<v Speaker 2>and just didn't know.</v>

4206
02:06:29.580 --> 02:06:30.413
<v Speaker 2>He didn't come.</v>

4207
02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:33.150
<v Speaker 2>It was also not informed about the line guy.</v>

4208
02:06:33.151 --> 02:06:33.630
<v Speaker 2>He was wrong.</v>

4209
02:06:33.630 --> 02:06:34.380
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying.</v>

4210
02:06:34.380 --> 02:06:35.280
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying.</v>

4211
02:06:35.281 --> 02:06:40.281
<v Speaker 2>It's like I think we all need to get smarter if we have established a voice on</v>

4212
02:06:40.411 --> 02:06:41.220
<v Speaker 2>the web,</v>

4213
02:06:41.220 --> 02:06:45.660
<v Speaker 2>like take an extra second to before you hit that send button.</v>

4214
02:06:45.990 --> 02:06:46.521
<v Speaker 2>I know I've.</v>

4215
02:06:46.521 --> 02:06:48.780
<v Speaker 2>I've had this experience myself in,</v>

4216
02:06:48.781 --> 02:06:49.160
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

4217
02:06:49.160 --> 02:06:49.361
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

4218
02:06:49.361 --> 02:06:52.410
<v Speaker 2>in the various communications I've had about products let's say,</v>

4219
02:06:52.411 --> 02:06:57.000
<v Speaker 2>or videos I want to make or tweets I want to send of like what is the effect of</v>

4220
02:06:57.001 --> 02:06:57.601
<v Speaker 2>this thing going to be.</v>

4221
02:06:57.601 --> 02:07:01.740
<v Speaker 2>It might even be the way that I feel and I still don't want to do it because I</v>

4222
02:07:01.741 --> 02:07:02.160
<v Speaker 2>don't.</v>

4223
02:07:02.160 --> 02:07:03.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking about the reaction.</v>

4224
02:07:03.811 --> 02:07:08.811
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking about the trickle effect of this particular sentiment and I don't</v>

4225
02:07:08.851 --> 02:07:09.750
<v Speaker 2>think we're there yet.</v>

4226
02:07:09.870 --> 02:07:11.460
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of the influencers,</v>

4227
02:07:11.461 --> 02:07:15.630
<v Speaker 2>if you want to call them that are behaving irresponsibly in,</v>

4228
02:07:15.680 --> 02:07:16.410
<v Speaker 2>in wa,</v>

4229
02:07:16.410 --> 02:07:18.330
<v Speaker 2>in wanting to put out a hot take,</v>

4230
02:07:18.390 --> 02:07:22.080
<v Speaker 2>wanting to have something to say about this topic that has overwhelmed the web</v>

4231
02:07:22.380 --> 02:07:27.090
<v Speaker 2>that we're susceptible to the same thing that the lower level jerk in his room</v>

4232
02:07:27.091 --> 02:07:31.020
<v Speaker 2>or that other guy that you were speaking about because it's attractive,</v>

4233
02:07:31.021 --> 02:07:33.390
<v Speaker 2>it's attractive to get involved in the conversation.</v>

4234
02:07:33.630 --> 02:07:35.160
<v Speaker 2>Even with limited information.</v>

4235
02:07:35.200 --> 02:07:35.891
<v Speaker 2>That's a real.</v>

4236
02:07:35.891 --> 02:07:36.040
<v Speaker 2>You're</v>

4237
02:07:36.040 --> 02:07:36.431
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

4238
02:07:36.431 --> 02:07:36.971
<v Speaker 1>you're dead right,</v>

4239
02:07:36.971 --> 02:07:40.630
<v Speaker 1>and I think we've all been guilty of that and I think that's a really good point</v>

4240
02:07:40.631 --> 02:07:45.190
<v Speaker 1>and a really important point because I think that whenever a subject comes up</v>

4241
02:07:45.400 --> 02:07:46.233
<v Speaker 1>people do.</v>

4242
02:07:46.750 --> 02:07:48.490
<v Speaker 1>If say there was no podcast,</v>

4243
02:07:48.491 --> 02:07:49.480
<v Speaker 1>no podcasts at all,</v>

4244
02:07:49.570 --> 02:07:52.570
<v Speaker 1>and someone brought up some point like that lady who's denying people gay</v>

4245
02:07:52.571 --> 02:07:53.404
<v Speaker 1>marriage,</v>

4246
02:07:53.440 --> 02:07:56.730
<v Speaker 1>that lady in Kentucky and we will be like this fucking dumb cunt.</v>

4247
02:07:56.731 --> 02:07:57.190
<v Speaker 1>Like we,</v>

4248
02:07:57.190 --> 02:07:57.390
<v Speaker 1>we'll,</v>

4249
02:07:57.390 --> 02:07:59.350
<v Speaker 1>we'll all start talking shit like someone,</v>

4250
02:07:59.530 --> 02:08:03.640
<v Speaker 1>someone should go over house to hold her down and make make guys fuck right in</v>

4251
02:08:03.641 --> 02:08:04.474
<v Speaker 1>front of her face.</v>

4252
02:08:06.150 --> 02:08:10.480
<v Speaker 1>A bunch of crazy shit that's not really a responsible thing to say,</v>

4253
02:08:10.630 --> 02:08:12.760
<v Speaker 1>but then you do it in a podcast like this.</v>

4254
02:08:13.060 --> 02:08:16.510
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I like about people wearing headsets is that at least it</v>

4255
02:08:16.511 --> 02:08:18.790
<v Speaker 1>makes you think that you're do something professionally.</v>

4256
02:08:19.020 --> 02:08:19.680
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

4257
02:08:19.680 --> 02:08:20.590
<v Speaker 1>there's a bit of a ride.</v>

4258
02:08:20.660 --> 02:08:22.630
<v Speaker 1>It's been a few times where I was like,</v>

4259
02:08:22.631 --> 02:08:22.931
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

4260
02:08:22.931 --> 02:08:25.810
<v Speaker 1>maybe wearing headsets like,</v>

4261
02:08:25.840 --> 02:08:27.730
<v Speaker 1>because you forget that.</v>

4262
02:08:27.790 --> 02:08:29.980
<v Speaker 1>That is really cool what you're saying.</v>

4263
02:08:30.010 --> 02:08:30.121
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4264
02:08:30.121 --> 02:08:31.090
<v Speaker 1>I never thought of that.</v>

4265
02:08:31.120 --> 02:08:33.370
<v Speaker 1>That's how I think about it because I think there's something,</v>

4266
02:08:33.550 --> 02:08:35.500
<v Speaker 1>something about it being in your ear,</v>

4267
02:08:35.560 --> 02:08:38.170
<v Speaker 1>like I hear you in my ear just as clearly as I hear him,</v>

4268
02:08:38.350 --> 02:08:40.060
<v Speaker 1>even though he's a few extra feet away,</v>

4269
02:08:40.390 --> 02:08:40.651
<v Speaker 1>every.</v>

4270
02:08:40.651 --> 02:08:45.651
<v Speaker 1>We're all in the same sound waves and I and that makes me feel professional</v>

4271
02:08:46.250 --> 02:08:51.250
<v Speaker 1>extracts you just enough from the sort of regular hangout zone that you're like,</v>

4272
02:08:51.341 --> 02:08:52.000
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

4273
02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:52.811
<v Speaker 1>people are listening.</v>

4274
02:08:52.811 --> 02:08:53.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4275
02:08:53.400 --> 02:08:53.980
<v Speaker 1>People do.</v>

4276
02:08:53.980 --> 02:08:55.930
<v Speaker 1>You measure it just to maybe a second.</v>

4277
02:08:56.130 --> 02:08:57.040
<v Speaker 1>Wait a second longer.</v>

4278
02:08:57.130 --> 02:08:59.320
<v Speaker 1>It's a real point that I think a lot of people,</v>

4279
02:08:59.321 --> 02:09:01.750
<v Speaker 1>especially comedians when I have comedians on the podcast,</v>

4280
02:09:01.751 --> 02:09:04.840
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they just forget that or they're not aware of that or they're not</v>

4281
02:09:04.841 --> 02:09:08.750
<v Speaker 1>aware of it to the extent that I am because I know the numbers like you're.</v>

4282
02:09:08.750 --> 02:09:12.130
<v Speaker 1>You're doing a show and there's a lot of people listening and you have a</v>

4283
02:09:12.131 --> 02:09:13.660
<v Speaker 1>responsibility to be entertaining,</v>

4284
02:09:13.661 --> 02:09:15.580
<v Speaker 1>but you also have responsibility to be accurate.</v>

4285
02:09:15.820 --> 02:09:18.940
<v Speaker 1>You can't really say things that people might just take as fact.</v>

4286
02:09:19.220 --> 02:09:21.370
<v Speaker 1>You haven't researched them because you,</v>

4287
02:09:21.400 --> 02:09:21.790
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

4288
02:09:21.790 --> 02:09:25.840
<v Speaker 1>You're reaching millions and millions of people now and I can change the way</v>

4289
02:09:25.841 --> 02:09:26.770
<v Speaker 1>they look at things.</v>

4290
02:09:26.800 --> 02:09:27.280
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

4291
02:09:27.280 --> 02:09:30.520
<v Speaker 1>So like when this mike huckabee guy latches on,</v>

4292
02:09:30.521 --> 02:09:33.070
<v Speaker 1>you know that fucking guy who latched onto that kim lady,</v>

4293
02:09:33.350 --> 02:09:34.181
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck her name is?</v>

4294
02:09:34.181 --> 02:09:36.100
<v Speaker 1>The Kentucky clerk wouldn't allow it,</v>

4295
02:09:36.130 --> 02:09:36.580
<v Speaker 1>gave me.</v>

4296
02:09:36.580 --> 02:09:38.290
<v Speaker 1>He fucking immediately like,</v>

4297
02:09:38.291 --> 02:09:42.190
<v Speaker 1>this is a great thing of who he starts tweeting about it.</v>

4298
02:09:42.191 --> 02:09:44.290
<v Speaker 1>There's a warm religious freedom,</v>

4299
02:09:44.470 --> 02:09:45.730
<v Speaker 1>religious liberty,</v>

4300
02:09:45.731 --> 02:09:46.810
<v Speaker 1>and it was hilarious.</v>

4301
02:09:46.811 --> 02:09:50.400
<v Speaker 1>Like hashtag religious liberty and all these other apes got involved.</v>

4302
02:09:50.410 --> 02:09:51.243
<v Speaker 1>They're all</v>

4303
02:09:52.180 --> 02:09:54.010
<v Speaker 1>screaming and yelling and it's cool.</v>

4304
02:09:54.011 --> 02:09:59.011
<v Speaker 1>It's cool to watch because you're watching like the last gasps of a dying,</v>

4305
02:09:59.620 --> 02:10:01.060
<v Speaker 1>ignorant perspective.</v>

4306
02:10:01.240 --> 02:10:06.240
<v Speaker 1>You're literally seeing the last few generations of monkeys that believe some</v>

4307
02:10:06.700 --> 02:10:10.660
<v Speaker 1>dumb shit that was written on animal skins thousands of years ago.</v>

4308
02:10:10.870 --> 02:10:15.490
<v Speaker 1>You're seeing the last echoes of the game of telephone where you tell someone,</v>

4309
02:10:15.491 --> 02:10:19.090
<v Speaker 1>and I tell someone and it gets translated from generation to generation for over</v>

4310
02:10:19.090 --> 02:10:20.670
<v Speaker 1>a thousand years before anybody buys.</v>

4311
02:10:20.680 --> 02:10:22.120
<v Speaker 1>It bothers writing it down.</v>

4312
02:10:22.300 --> 02:10:23.470
<v Speaker 1>Then once they write it down,</v>

4313
02:10:23.620 --> 02:10:27.190
<v Speaker 1>they write it down into fucking dead language and that's to be translated to all</v>

4314
02:10:27.191 --> 02:10:28.090
<v Speaker 1>these other languages.</v>

4315
02:10:28.091 --> 02:10:28.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4316
02:10:28.320 --> 02:10:29.380
<v Speaker 1>that is what we're seeing.</v>

4317
02:10:29.381 --> 02:10:33.440
<v Speaker 1>We see that lady screaming with her glasses on the mike huckabee fucking</v>

4318
02:10:33.441 --> 02:10:34.274
<v Speaker 1>convention,</v>

4319
02:10:34.790 --> 02:10:36.140
<v Speaker 1>going to stop all that.</v>

4320
02:10:36.170 --> 02:10:39.050
<v Speaker 1>Fuck fucking she's yelling it out.</v>

4321
02:10:39.051 --> 02:10:43.730
<v Speaker 1>We're seeing a woman who contradicts the very message of the bible itself</v>

4322
02:10:43.731 --> 02:10:45.470
<v Speaker 1>because she's been married for fucking dimes.</v>

4323
02:10:45.740 --> 02:10:46.910
<v Speaker 1>You're not supposed to get divorced.</v>

4324
02:10:47.060 --> 02:10:49.220
<v Speaker 1>How many religious people that you know that have tattoos?</v>

4325
02:10:49.310 --> 02:10:50.840
<v Speaker 1>You're not supposed to get tattoos.</v>

4326
02:10:50.960 --> 02:10:52.730
<v Speaker 1>He can't fucking pick and choose.</v>

4327
02:10:52.950 --> 02:10:54.680
<v Speaker 1>We can't pick and choose your shit.</v>

4328
02:10:54.681 --> 02:10:55.820
<v Speaker 1>Cherry picker religion.</v>

4329
02:10:55.850 --> 02:10:56.161
<v Speaker 1>They do.</v>

4330
02:10:56.161 --> 02:10:58.790
<v Speaker 1>They cherry pick what they like and what they don't like about their religion</v>

4331
02:10:59.070 --> 02:11:01.620
<v Speaker 1>she has done is just as bad as a mouth fucking.</v>

4332
02:11:03.070 --> 02:11:04.120
<v Speaker 1>I think what I think.</v>

4333
02:11:04.370 --> 02:11:08.420
<v Speaker 1>I think what you're saying is completely true here in north America,</v>

4334
02:11:08.720 --> 02:11:11.000
<v Speaker 1>but globally religion.</v>

4335
02:11:11.150 --> 02:11:11.810
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

4336
02:11:11.810 --> 02:11:12.160
<v Speaker 1>it ain't.</v>

4337
02:11:12.160 --> 02:11:13.700
<v Speaker 1>He's slowing down will.</v>

4338
02:11:13.701 --> 02:11:18.701
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to get the internet to like places in the middle of nowhere and it's</v>

4339
02:11:19.881 --> 02:11:22.670
<v Speaker 1>hard to get the influence of those communities in them,</v>

4340
02:11:22.671 --> 02:11:24.200
<v Speaker 1>but it will happen eventually.</v>

4341
02:11:24.201 --> 02:11:24.680
<v Speaker 1>I agree,</v>

4342
02:11:24.680 --> 02:11:26.120
<v Speaker 1>and when it does happen,</v>

4343
02:11:26.510 --> 02:11:30.830
<v Speaker 1>you realize that your perspective is simply the perspective of the people around</v>

4344
02:11:30.831 --> 02:11:31.490
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

4345
02:11:31.490 --> 02:11:33.750
<v Speaker 1>that you have sort of adopted and your,</v>

4346
02:11:33.780 --> 02:11:34.850
<v Speaker 1>your view of life,</v>

4347
02:11:34.910 --> 02:11:35.990
<v Speaker 1>your view of religion,</v>

4348
02:11:35.991 --> 02:11:36.680
<v Speaker 1>your view of all.</v>

4349
02:11:36.680 --> 02:11:41.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've had people on my podcast that used to be muslim and they've become</v>

4350
02:11:41.541 --> 02:11:42.600
<v Speaker 1>atheists and they,</v>

4351
02:11:42.610 --> 02:11:42.890
<v Speaker 1>they've.</v>

4352
02:11:42.890 --> 02:11:44.530
<v Speaker 1>They lived there in,</v>

4353
02:11:44.590 --> 02:11:44.920
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

4354
02:11:44.920 --> 02:11:47.870
<v Speaker 1>in the middle east and they were a part of that culture and they thought like</v>

4355
02:11:47.871 --> 02:11:50.780
<v Speaker 1>those people did and then they came over here and they started reading.</v>

4356
02:11:50.781 --> 02:11:51.614
<v Speaker 1>I started getting into it.</v>

4357
02:11:51.620 --> 02:11:53.510
<v Speaker 1>They hard to really know what the fuck is.</v>

4358
02:11:53.511 --> 02:11:55.280
<v Speaker 1>This ideology that I've subscribed to,</v>

4359
02:11:55.430 --> 02:11:57.380
<v Speaker 1>this isn't the only way to think and not only that,</v>

4360
02:11:57.381 --> 02:12:01.130
<v Speaker 1>it's not if you take enough time and look at it objectively,</v>

4361
02:12:01.490 --> 02:12:02.780
<v Speaker 1>it's not even rational.</v>

4362
02:12:02.810 --> 02:12:06.080
<v Speaker 1>It's not like this is a bulletproof ideology,</v>

4363
02:12:06.140 --> 02:12:09.830
<v Speaker 1>but that's how it's most religions try to pass their stuff off.</v>

4364
02:12:09.980 --> 02:12:12.980
<v Speaker 1>Scientology tries to pass them their self off like that.</v>

4365
02:12:13.130 --> 02:12:15.200
<v Speaker 1>They try to pass their stuff off as bulletproof,</v>

4366
02:12:15.201 --> 02:12:17.090
<v Speaker 1>like this is the way that's the sale,</v>

4367
02:12:17.120 --> 02:12:17.960
<v Speaker 1>that's the sales pitch.</v>

4368
02:12:18.080 --> 02:12:20.030
<v Speaker 1>This is the way to become happy.</v>

4369
02:12:20.290 --> 02:12:20.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4370
02:12:20.760 --> 02:12:21.593
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4371
02:12:21.770 --> 02:12:22.371
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>

4372
02:12:22.371 --> 02:12:25.670
<v Speaker 1>I think the internet is the cure to that information.</v>

4373
02:12:25.670 --> 02:12:27.500
<v Speaker 1>Information for sure.</v>

4374
02:12:27.530 --> 02:12:27.890
<v Speaker 1>Is it.</v>

4375
02:12:27.890 --> 02:12:32.890
<v Speaker 1>Is is the number one sort of ulterior fighting force against this type of stuff</v>

4376
02:12:34.221 --> 02:12:35.054
<v Speaker 1>that you're talking about?</v>

4377
02:12:35.300 --> 02:12:40.300
<v Speaker 1>Access to it in the same way we were talking about getting internet into a hard</v>

4378
02:12:41.001 --> 02:12:41.990
<v Speaker 1>to reach places.</v>

4379
02:12:42.050 --> 02:12:46.130
<v Speaker 1>That's actually a google x project that they're working on with these air</v>

4380
02:12:46.131 --> 02:12:46.551
<v Speaker 1>balloons.</v>

4381
02:12:46.551 --> 02:12:47.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you've heard about this.</v>

4382
02:12:48.080 --> 02:12:48.291
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4383
02:12:48.291 --> 02:12:49.520
<v Speaker 1>the wifi balloons,</v>

4384
02:12:49.521 --> 02:12:49.780
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

4385
02:12:49.780 --> 02:12:54.380
<v Speaker 1>so it's like crazy weather balloons that hover above areas that have no service.</v>

4386
02:12:55.160 --> 02:12:58.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm hard to reach places and they're on a cycle,</v>

4387
02:12:58.400 --> 02:13:02.780
<v Speaker 1>so your phone is rapidly switching between the one that's actually overhead at</v>

4388
02:13:02.781 --> 02:13:06.500
<v Speaker 1>that point and is that one slowly drifts out of range on the jet stream.</v>

4389
02:13:07.010 --> 02:13:08.990
<v Speaker 1>The next one float off the next one,</v>

4390
02:13:08.991 --> 02:13:09.340
<v Speaker 1>flow,</v>

4391
02:13:09.340 --> 02:13:09.680
<v Speaker 1>flow,</v>

4392
02:13:09.680 --> 02:13:10.341
<v Speaker 1>flow is in,</v>

4393
02:13:10.341 --> 02:13:13.430
<v Speaker 1>and then you hand off to that one so you don't notice an interruption in</v>

4394
02:13:13.431 --> 02:13:14.264
<v Speaker 1>connection.</v>

4395
02:13:14.360 --> 02:13:16.790
<v Speaker 1>But since a weather balloon can't sit there forever,</v>

4396
02:13:17.080 --> 02:13:17.390
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

4397
02:13:17.390 --> 02:13:17.741
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4398
02:13:17.741 --> 02:13:18.001
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

4399
02:13:18.001 --> 02:13:18.250
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

4400
02:13:18.250 --> 02:13:21.620
<v Speaker 1>it's float floating along along with the weather system.</v>

4401
02:13:22.010 --> 02:13:22.310
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4402
02:13:22.310 --> 02:13:24.050
<v Speaker 1>but some really cool technology.</v>

4403
02:13:24.051 --> 02:13:27.110
<v Speaker 1>There's some videos online that show how they've made it a.</v>

4404
02:13:27.140 --> 02:13:28.040
<v Speaker 1>So the idea being,</v>

4405
02:13:28.041 --> 02:13:31.880
<v Speaker 1>it's like places like North Korea for float,</v>

4406
02:13:31.881 --> 02:13:31.980
<v Speaker 1>you</v>

4407
02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:34.380
<v Speaker 2>fucking balloons to just shoot them out of the sky.</v>

4408
02:13:34.920 --> 02:13:35.430
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4409
02:13:35.430 --> 02:13:36.263
<v Speaker 2>it's actually kind of,</v>

4410
02:13:36.300 --> 02:13:36.500
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

4411
02:13:36.500 --> 02:13:39.930
<v Speaker 2>they're pretty high up sound like you're selling them.</v>

4412
02:13:40.040 --> 02:13:41.100
<v Speaker 2>And I am,</v>

4413
02:13:41.101 --> 02:13:43.590
<v Speaker 2>I am because fuck this North Korea shit for real,</v>

4414
02:13:43.820 --> 02:13:44.271
<v Speaker 2>for real,</v>

4415
02:13:44.271 --> 02:13:44.770
<v Speaker 2>for real,</v>

4416
02:13:44.770 --> 02:13:45.330
<v Speaker 2>for real.</v>

4417
02:13:45.330 --> 02:13:48.690
<v Speaker 2>That's bonkers that we're allowing that to still exist.</v>

4418
02:13:48.910 --> 02:13:49.270
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

4419
02:13:49.270 --> 02:13:50.160
<v Speaker 2>and the beauty of it,</v>

4420
02:13:50.161 --> 02:13:53.280
<v Speaker 2>it's like going in there without weapons going in there with information.</v>

4421
02:13:53.281 --> 02:13:54.870
<v Speaker 2>Don't you love that storyline?</v>

4422
02:13:55.210 --> 02:13:56.910
<v Speaker 2>We're going in there with connectivity.</v>

4423
02:13:56.911 --> 02:13:57.744
<v Speaker 2>Bitch.</v>

4424
02:13:57.750 --> 02:13:58.410
<v Speaker 2>We're gonna.</v>

4425
02:13:58.410 --> 02:13:58.950
<v Speaker 2>We're gonna,</v>

4426
02:13:58.950 --> 02:13:59.640
<v Speaker 2>we're gonna.</v>

4427
02:13:59.640 --> 02:14:00.030
<v Speaker 2>We're gonna.</v>

4428
02:14:00.030 --> 02:14:01.680
<v Speaker 2>Bring it up from the grassroots,</v>

4429
02:14:01.740 --> 02:14:03.680
<v Speaker 2>the rise of a nation led bulbs.</v>

4430
02:14:03.700 --> 02:14:06.750
<v Speaker 2>Let the people make the decision for themselves.</v>

4431
02:14:06.870 --> 02:14:08.490
<v Speaker 2>And you've got South Korea right there.</v>

4432
02:14:08.760 --> 02:14:09.091
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4433
02:14:09.091 --> 02:14:10.080
<v Speaker 2>it'd be so easy.</v>

4434
02:14:10.110 --> 02:14:13.680
<v Speaker 2>So you get this beautiful little base to let these things go over.</v>

4435
02:14:13.681 --> 02:14:14.070
<v Speaker 2>I've just,</v>

4436
02:14:14.070 --> 02:14:16.350
<v Speaker 2>I love the idea of informational warfare.</v>

4437
02:14:16.710 --> 02:14:17.340
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4438
02:14:17.340 --> 02:14:18.180
<v Speaker 2>that he doesn't,</v>

4439
02:14:18.590 --> 02:14:21.810
<v Speaker 2>that he doesn't have to be about bullets and bombs,</v>

4440
02:14:21.811 --> 02:14:24.510
<v Speaker 2>that if you can reach enough people with a particular message,</v>

4441
02:14:24.780 --> 02:14:25.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4442
02:14:25.050 --> 02:14:27.010
<v Speaker 2>they can figure it out just to just like,</v>

4443
02:14:27.320 --> 02:14:28.530
<v Speaker 2>right for them.</v>

4444
02:14:28.530 --> 02:14:29.460
<v Speaker 2>It'll take a lot of time.</v>

4445
02:14:29.461 --> 02:14:30.750
<v Speaker 2>They're so deep in the web.</v>

4446
02:14:30.800 --> 02:14:31.471
<v Speaker 2>I don't know man,</v>

4447
02:14:31.471 --> 02:14:35.190
<v Speaker 2>because anywhere like you just spoke about a person completely changing their</v>

4448
02:14:35.191 --> 02:14:37.920
<v Speaker 2>religious outlook just upon arriving somewhere else.</v>

4449
02:14:38.010 --> 02:14:38.671
<v Speaker 2>When you think about it,</v>

4450
02:14:38.671 --> 02:14:39.630
<v Speaker 2>what is the difference?</v>

4451
02:14:39.900 --> 02:14:43.130
<v Speaker 2>It's the information available to them even though it might not be on a phone or</v>

4452
02:14:43.200 --> 02:14:44.400
<v Speaker 2>or a or a laptop.</v>

4453
02:14:44.580 --> 02:14:47.670
<v Speaker 2>It's the information they're supposed to by the culture they're surrounded with.</v>

4454
02:14:47.730 --> 02:14:49.410
<v Speaker 2>It's not the geographic location.</v>

4455
02:14:49.970 --> 02:14:50.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4456
02:14:50.220 --> 02:14:51.120
<v Speaker 2>you're exactly right.</v>

4457
02:14:51.121 --> 02:14:55.620
<v Speaker 2>And if you look at how quickly uprisings took place in places like Egypt and so</v>

4458
02:14:55.621 --> 02:14:56.310
<v Speaker 2>on spring,</v>

4459
02:14:56.310 --> 02:14:57.810
<v Speaker 2>it was just like give them twitter,</v>

4460
02:14:57.990 --> 02:14:58.830
<v Speaker 2>holy shit.</v>

4461
02:14:58.831 --> 02:15:03.360
<v Speaker 2>And immediate overhaul in the behavior because all of a sudden now you've got</v>

4462
02:15:03.361 --> 02:15:07.140
<v Speaker 2>this massive cultural shift of communication and so on,</v>

4463
02:15:07.380 --> 02:15:08.670
<v Speaker 2>and people with access to google.</v>

4464
02:15:08.760 --> 02:15:09.001
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4465
02:15:09.001 --> 02:15:14.001
<v Speaker 2>why do you think China has been blocking youtube and google since day one,</v>

4466
02:15:14.880 --> 02:15:15.451
<v Speaker 2>day one,</v>

4467
02:15:15.451 --> 02:15:16.740
<v Speaker 2>because the warfare is,</v>

4468
02:15:16.800 --> 02:15:18.540
<v Speaker 2>has always been about information.</v>

4469
02:15:18.690 --> 02:15:21.120
<v Speaker 2>World war two doesn't happen without propaganda.</v>

4470
02:15:21.210 --> 02:15:22.830
<v Speaker 2>Will have a friend who works at worked,</v>

4471
02:15:22.890 --> 02:15:24.080
<v Speaker 2>doesn't work anymore.</v>

4472
02:15:24.130 --> 02:15:24.391
<v Speaker 2>Google.</v>

4473
02:15:24.391 --> 02:15:27.510
<v Speaker 2>But she would go over to China and have meetings with these people and they were</v>

4474
02:15:27.511 --> 02:15:27.661
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

4475
02:15:27.661 --> 02:15:27.781
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

4476
02:15:27.781 --> 02:15:29.470
<v Speaker 2>we want access to these people's emails.</v>

4477
02:15:29.700 --> 02:15:31.170
<v Speaker 2>We want to be able to block these things.</v>

4478
02:15:31.171 --> 02:15:31.411
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

4479
02:15:31.411 --> 02:15:31.670
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>

4480
02:15:31.670 --> 02:15:31.891
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>

4481
02:15:31.891 --> 02:15:32.101
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

4482
02:15:32.101 --> 02:15:33.500
<v Speaker 2>That's not what we're dealing with.</v>

4483
02:15:34.200 --> 02:15:37.410
<v Speaker 2>That's an important distinction to make because it's not that.</v>

4484
02:15:37.470 --> 02:15:38.890
<v Speaker 2>It's not that I'm,</v>

4485
02:15:39.030 --> 02:15:40.260
<v Speaker 2>that they're just blocked.</v>

4486
02:15:40.261 --> 02:15:43.800
<v Speaker 2>It's also that google doesn't want to be there either for those exact reasons.</v>

4487
02:15:43.801 --> 02:15:44.101
<v Speaker 2>So it's a,</v>

4488
02:15:44.101 --> 02:15:44.730
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

4489
02:15:44.730 --> 02:15:46.200
<v Speaker 2>it's a two way thing.</v>

4490
02:15:46.350 --> 02:15:46.980
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

4491
02:15:46.980 --> 02:15:47.640
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4492
02:15:47.640 --> 02:15:48.150
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

4493
02:15:48.150 --> 02:15:52.380
<v Speaker 2>I think that the control control structures that exist in our global</v>

4494
02:15:52.410 --> 02:15:53.310
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>

4495
02:15:53.520 --> 02:15:56.250
<v Speaker 2>they exist for because of an agenda,</v>

4496
02:15:56.251 --> 02:15:57.240
<v Speaker 2>a particular agenda,</v>

4497
02:15:57.241 --> 02:15:57.931
<v Speaker 2>whatever that might be.</v>

4498
02:15:57.931 --> 02:15:59.700
<v Speaker 2>And you can't control people if you,</v>

4499
02:15:59.750 --> 02:16:00.583
<v Speaker 2>if you can,</v>

4500
02:16:00.750 --> 02:16:02.400
<v Speaker 2>if you don't control information flow.</v>

4501
02:16:02.550 --> 02:16:07.550
<v Speaker 2>And also I think that people are almost automatically or naturally gravitate</v>

4502
02:16:08.700 --> 02:16:11.070
<v Speaker 2>towards controlling others if they have power,</v>

4503
02:16:11.410 --> 02:16:12.243
<v Speaker 2>Nevada,</v>

4504
02:16:12.300 --> 02:16:16.410
<v Speaker 2>Nevada state athletic commission or any king or dictatorship or what people felt</v>

4505
02:16:16.411 --> 02:16:17.490
<v Speaker 2>about the nsa.</v>

4506
02:16:17.520 --> 02:16:21.270
<v Speaker 2>That's why people are so outraged with edward stoten thing that these people who</v>

4507
02:16:21.271 --> 02:16:22.170
<v Speaker 2>are no different than,</v>

4508
02:16:22.171 --> 02:16:22.591
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4509
02:16:22.591 --> 02:16:27.591
<v Speaker 2>different than I just got jobs and could research ex-girlfriends emails and I</v>

4510
02:16:28.461 --> 02:16:32.320
<v Speaker 2>mean they could do all kinds of creepy shit that you shouldn't really be able to</v>

4511
02:16:32.321 --> 02:16:33.071
<v Speaker 2>do in the public.</v>

4512
02:16:33.071 --> 02:16:34.510
<v Speaker 2>Didn't know about power corrupts.</v>

4513
02:16:34.540 --> 02:16:35.700
<v Speaker 2>Power corrupts absolutely.</v>

4514
02:16:35.720 --> 02:16:36.553
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely pal.</v>

4515
02:16:36.620 --> 02:16:37.240
<v Speaker 2>Absolute.</v>

4516
02:16:37.240 --> 02:16:38.230
<v Speaker 2>Whatever the hell it works.</v>

4517
02:16:38.350 --> 02:16:39.183
<v Speaker 2>How's it going?</v>

4518
02:16:39.550 --> 02:16:43.140
<v Speaker 2>Absolute power corrupts absolute power corrupts absolutely.</v>

4519
02:16:43.141 --> 02:16:44.710
<v Speaker 2>And absolute power corrupts absolutely.</v>

4520
02:16:44.711 --> 02:16:45.430
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>

4521
02:16:45.430 --> 02:16:47.620
<v Speaker 2>Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.</v>

4522
02:16:47.980 --> 02:16:48.221
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4523
02:16:48.221 --> 02:16:50.140
<v Speaker 2>And the governments have absolute power.</v>

4524
02:16:50.170 --> 02:16:50.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4525
02:16:50.680 --> 02:16:53.980
<v Speaker 2>Government of North Korea absolutely has absolute power and that's the scariest</v>

4526
02:16:53.981 --> 02:16:55.120
<v Speaker 2>version that we have.</v>

4527
02:16:55.810 --> 02:16:59.350
<v Speaker 2>And it's also throws in the face whenever the us talks about invading Syria or</v>

4528
02:16:59.351 --> 02:17:00.161
<v Speaker 2>in these other places.</v>

4529
02:17:00.161 --> 02:17:02.230
<v Speaker 2>Like what about the worst spot?</v>

4530
02:17:03.070 --> 02:17:04.660
<v Speaker 2>The spot with nuclear bombs,</v>

4531
02:17:04.661 --> 02:17:05.950
<v Speaker 2>it's run by a fucking nut,</v>

4532
02:17:06.040 --> 02:17:07.060
<v Speaker 2>completely true.</v>

4533
02:17:07.090 --> 02:17:11.890
<v Speaker 2>And when you have allies like South Korea,</v>

4534
02:17:11.950 --> 02:17:14.770
<v Speaker 2>Japan that are right in the zone,</v>

4535
02:17:14.771 --> 02:17:17.350
<v Speaker 2>they're writing bombs zone and like what?</v>

4536
02:17:18.430 --> 02:17:22.630
<v Speaker 2>I just imagined that there was a border here with that kind of shit on the other</v>

4537
02:17:22.631 --> 02:17:23.350
<v Speaker 2>side.</v>

4538
02:17:23.350 --> 02:17:24.630
<v Speaker 2>Like that's a,</v>

4539
02:17:24.680 --> 02:17:27.610
<v Speaker 2>a daily life type situation for people in South Korea.</v>

4540
02:17:27.611 --> 02:17:29.590
<v Speaker 2>It's a completely developed place,</v>

4541
02:17:29.800 --> 02:17:34.800
<v Speaker 2>much like here culturally complete free and open marketplace and their neighbor,</v>

4542
02:17:35.530 --> 02:17:37.390
<v Speaker 2>their neighbor or these psychos,</v>

4543
02:17:37.450 --> 02:17:40.420
<v Speaker 2>like it's one thing for us to think about it at this distance,</v>

4544
02:17:40.780 --> 02:17:44.920
<v Speaker 2>but those people daily life is wondering what the fuck is gonna happen and the</v>

4545
02:17:44.921 --> 02:17:45.641
<v Speaker 2>whole country,</v>

4546
02:17:45.641 --> 02:17:50.641
<v Speaker 2>north and South Korea is like the size of Texas that too had those big as North</v>

4547
02:17:50.920 --> 02:17:52.030
<v Speaker 2>Korea and South Korea.</v>

4548
02:17:52.060 --> 02:17:52.661
<v Speaker 2>Find that out.</v>

4549
02:17:52.661 --> 02:17:53.840
<v Speaker 2>I would say that combine.</v>

4550
02:17:53.890 --> 02:17:54.220
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4551
02:17:54.220 --> 02:17:55.480
<v Speaker 2>I would say you're about right.</v>

4552
02:17:55.481 --> 02:17:57.010
<v Speaker 2>And if their grocery stores are fake,</v>

4553
02:17:57.040 --> 02:17:57.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4554
02:17:57.310 --> 02:18:00.770
<v Speaker 2>and if they're like putting this whole fake thing on their nuclear stories</v>

4555
02:18:00.790 --> 02:18:01.180
<v Speaker 2>affect,</v>

4556
02:18:01.180 --> 02:18:01.421
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4557
02:18:01.421 --> 02:18:04.000
<v Speaker 2>like how they have the vice documentary.</v>

4558
02:18:04.001 --> 02:18:04.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4559
02:18:04.180 --> 02:18:04.950
<v Speaker 2>the restaurants.</v>

4560
02:18:04.950 --> 02:18:05.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4561
02:18:05.280 --> 02:18:06.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4562
02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:10.540
<v Speaker 2>Vice did they set up fake restaurants for pr purposes to make it look like</v>

4563
02:18:10.550 --> 02:18:11.383
<v Speaker 2>they're normal,</v>

4564
02:18:11.650 --> 02:18:12.020
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

4565
02:18:12.020 --> 02:18:12.853
<v Speaker 2>you got another.</v>

4566
02:18:12.940 --> 02:18:15.580
<v Speaker 2>Their nuclear plans probably fake.</v>

4567
02:18:15.581 --> 02:18:16.480
<v Speaker 2>They can't do anything.</v>

4568
02:18:16.620 --> 02:18:17.051
<v Speaker 2>They're just,</v>

4569
02:18:17.051 --> 02:18:17.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4570
02:18:17.320 --> 02:18:18.680

4571
02:18:18.681 --> 02:18:21.340
<v Speaker 2>that they're nuclear missiles and they're all wonky.</v>

4596
02:18:59.230 --> 02:18:59.891
<v Speaker 2>Legal weed?</v>

4597
02:18:59.891 --> 02:19:00.131

02:19:00.131 --> 02:19:01.360
<v Speaker 2>Well medical like.</v>

4599
02:19:01.450 --> 02:19:01.691
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4600
02:19:01.691 --> 02:19:02.340
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

4601
02:19:02.340 --> 02:19:03.130
<v Speaker 2>Colorado.</v>

4602
02:19:03.130 --> 02:19:07.450
<v Speaker 2>Nobody has given a fuck about weeding Canada for as long as I've been alive.</v>

4603
02:19:07.600 --> 02:19:08.350
<v Speaker 2>So it.</v>

4604
02:19:08.350 --> 02:19:09.430
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's not on paper,</v>

4605
02:19:09.820 --> 02:19:10.690
<v Speaker 2>just make it on paper.</v>

4606
02:19:10.691 --> 02:19:10.871
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4607
02:19:10.871 --> 02:19:14.260
<v Speaker 2>Colorado has made more money in taxes this year for the first time ever.</v>

4608
02:19:14.261 --> 02:19:15.610
<v Speaker 2>Then alcohol with weed.</v>

4609
02:19:16.090 --> 02:19:16.240
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4610
02:19:16.240 --> 02:19:16.920
<v Speaker 2>your money from.</v>

4611
02:19:16.920 --> 02:19:17.770
<v Speaker 2>We'd actually.</v>

4612
02:19:17.771 --> 02:19:18.131
<v Speaker 2>And this is,</v>

4613
02:19:18.131 --> 02:19:19.900
<v Speaker 2>that's perfect for what he's talking about.</v>

4614
02:19:19.930 --> 02:19:22.420
<v Speaker 2>The lcpo is the ontario liquor board.</v>

4615
02:19:22.870 --> 02:19:25.960
<v Speaker 2>Who is the single biggest retailer of alcohol in the world.</v>

4616
02:19:26.050 --> 02:19:27.160
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>

4617
02:19:27.200 --> 02:19:29.360
<v Speaker 2>Because it's a huge marketplace.</v>

4618
02:19:29.420 --> 02:19:31.100
<v Speaker 2>Well big a big marketplace.</v>

4619
02:19:31.220 --> 02:19:34.910
<v Speaker 2>And they're the only sellers so they get to set the price.</v>

4620
02:19:34.911 --> 02:19:36.740
<v Speaker 2>So alcohol is expensive.</v>

4621
02:19:37.430 --> 02:19:42.430
<v Speaker 2>The stores are fucking magnificent samples and when they close at 8:00 PM.</v>

4622
02:19:42.831 --> 02:19:44.690
<v Speaker 2>So if you want to get some Jack Daniels at eight,</v>

4623
02:19:44.691 --> 02:19:45.161
<v Speaker 2>10 years,</v>

4624
02:19:45.161 --> 02:19:45.994
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4625
02:19:46.130 --> 02:19:47.270
<v Speaker 2>most of them are 10.</v>

4626
02:19:47.640 --> 02:19:47.770
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4627
02:19:47.770 --> 02:19:48.490
<v Speaker 2>it still,</v>

4628
02:19:48.490 --> 02:19:52.490
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't even go to bed until six or 10 and listen and listen,</v>

4629
02:19:52.640 --> 02:19:53.930
<v Speaker 2>there's an argument to be made.</v>

4630
02:19:53.931 --> 02:19:54.230
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

4631
02:19:54.230 --> 02:19:54.890
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

4632
02:19:54.890 --> 02:19:55.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4633
02:19:55.560 --> 02:19:55.791
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

4634
02:19:55.791 --> 02:19:56.900
<v Speaker 2>I see that side of it,</v>

4635
02:19:57.110 --> 02:20:01.430
<v Speaker 2>but there's some shady ass liquor stores too that you don't have to deal with</v>

4636
02:20:01.730 --> 02:20:02.563
<v Speaker 2>because it's,</v>

4637
02:20:02.600 --> 02:20:04.100
<v Speaker 2>it's treated the way that it is.</v>

4638
02:20:04.100 --> 02:20:06.290
<v Speaker 2>But see that's part of the fun of an open market.</v>

4639
02:20:06.320 --> 02:20:07.340
<v Speaker 2>Those shady ass lickers.</v>

4640
02:20:07.341 --> 02:20:07.950
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

4641
02:20:07.950 --> 02:20:08.370
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

4642
02:20:08.370 --> 02:20:08.970
<v Speaker 2>In phoenix.</v>

4643
02:20:08.970 --> 02:20:10.370
<v Speaker 2>Went to a drive through store.</v>

4644
02:20:10.580 --> 02:20:11.301
<v Speaker 2>We're in phoenix.</v>

4645
02:20:11.301 --> 02:20:12.260
<v Speaker 2>There was a guy who,</v>

4646
02:20:12.261 --> 02:20:12.500
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4647
02:20:12.500 --> 02:20:14.030
<v Speaker 2>he's dead now so we can talk shit about him.</v>

4648
02:20:14.360 --> 02:20:17.330
<v Speaker 2>He used to run this comedy club and he was out of his fucking mind.</v>

4649
02:20:17.331 --> 02:20:18.680
<v Speaker 2>He wouldn't let us drink on stage.</v>

4650
02:20:18.681 --> 02:20:21.590
<v Speaker 2>He said it was a law and we found out that there wasn't a law.</v>

4651
02:20:21.890 --> 02:20:25.790
<v Speaker 2>So what we decided to do was drive to this drive through fucking liquor store on</v>

4652
02:20:25.810 --> 02:20:28.130
<v Speaker 2>a bottle of Jack Daniels in a flask.</v>

4653
02:20:29.300 --> 02:20:30.950
<v Speaker 2>And then while I was on stage,</v>

4654
02:20:30.951 --> 02:20:32.780
<v Speaker 2>I explained that I was drinking diet coke,</v>

4655
02:20:32.781 --> 02:20:35.360
<v Speaker 2>but I liked to have warm diet coke and my cold.</v>

4656
02:20:35.361 --> 02:20:36.090
<v Speaker 2>Makes sense.</v>

4657
02:20:36.090 --> 02:20:37.040
<v Speaker 2>You would like turn around,</v>

4658
02:20:37.830 --> 02:20:42.170
<v Speaker 2>pull out of my pocket and one of the waitresses ratted me out.</v>

4659
02:20:42.170 --> 02:20:42.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4660
02:20:42.710 --> 02:20:44.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm with you either tomorrow by the way.</v>

4661
02:20:44.580 --> 02:20:45.413

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4667

<v Speaker 2>I think he's got 11 people so far killed.</v>

4669
02:20:57.920 --> 02:20:58.191
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

02:21:07.970 --> 02:21:09.110
<v Speaker 2>Great fucking comedy club.</v>

4677
02:21:09.111 --> 02:21:09.411
<v Speaker 2>We got to.</v>

4678
02:21:09.411 --> 02:21:09.951
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately,</v>

4679
02:21:09.951 --> 02:21:10.880
<v Speaker 2>we've got to wrap this thing up.</v>

4680
02:21:11.100 --> 02:21:11.470
<v Speaker 2>I go.</v>

4681
02:21:11.470 --> 02:21:13.430
<v Speaker 2>Can I just be clear about one thing here?</v>

4682
02:21:14.140 --> 02:21:16.400
<v Speaker 2>Open market booze in ontario.</v>

4683
02:21:16.430 --> 02:21:17.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm for that.</v>

4684
02:21:17.430 --> 02:21:17.960
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4685
02:21:17.960 --> 02:21:18.500
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4686
02:21:18.500 --> 02:21:20.150
<v Speaker 2>The lcb ozone is okay,</v>

4687
02:21:20.320 --> 02:21:21.050
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not.</v>

4688
02:21:21.050 --> 02:21:23.660
<v Speaker 2>That sounds like I was on team lcpo there.</v>

4689
02:21:23.690 --> 02:21:25.520
<v Speaker 2>I see what else cbo is.</v>

4690
02:21:25.521 --> 02:21:27.020
<v Speaker 2>That's the ontario liquor board.</v>

4691
02:21:27.380 --> 02:21:29.660
<v Speaker 2>The group that controls alcohol.</v>

4692
02:21:30.260 --> 02:21:30.740
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4693
02:21:30.740 --> 02:21:31.573
<v Speaker 2>Free market.</v>

4694
02:21:31.790 --> 02:21:32.623
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

4695
02:21:33.300 --> 02:21:33.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4696
02:21:33.590 --> 02:21:34.430
<v Speaker 2>It didn't sound like you were.</v>

4697
02:21:34.431 --> 02:21:34.990
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4698
02:21:34.990 --> 02:21:37.130
<v Speaker 2>Well it was painting something.</v>

4699
02:21:37.480 --> 02:21:41.140
<v Speaker 2>Let's get frustrated every time I go to toronto and then I get some Jack</v>

4700
02:21:41.140 --> 02:21:41.160
<v Speaker 2>Daniels.</v>

4701
02:21:41.160 --> 02:21:41.571
<v Speaker 2>I'll wait.</v>

4702
02:21:41.571 --> 02:21:42.860
<v Speaker 2>I can plan in advance.</v>

4703
02:21:42.920 --> 02:21:43.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4704
02:21:43.290 --> 02:21:44.480
<v Speaker 2>Now I just forget what.</v>

4705
02:21:44.481 --> 02:21:45.680
<v Speaker 2>You could still go to a bar.</v>

4706
02:21:45.730 --> 02:21:46.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4707
02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:46.330
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4708
02:21:46.330 --> 02:21:46.940
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

4709
02:21:46.940 --> 02:21:47.121
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4710
02:21:47.121 --> 02:21:47.480
<v Speaker 2>But I'm,</v>

4711
02:21:47.480 --> 02:21:47.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4712
02:21:47.760 --> 02:21:49.370
<v Speaker 2>I think liquor stores should be 24 hours a day.</v>

4713
02:21:49.371 --> 02:21:52.040
<v Speaker 2>That's the one thing that I really love about vegas is that they don't restrict</v>

4714
02:21:52.041 --> 02:21:52.710
<v Speaker 2>when you drink.</v>

4715
02:21:52.710 --> 02:21:56.780
<v Speaker 2>The bad thing is you have to have 15 different kinds of aids to get a medical</v>

4716
02:21:56.781 --> 02:21:57.740
<v Speaker 2>marijuana card there,</v>

4717
02:21:58.160 --> 02:21:59.180
<v Speaker 2>but that's just for now.</v>

4718
02:21:59.430 --> 02:21:59.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4719
02:21:59.680 --> 02:22:03.530
<v Speaker 2>well what I suppose to thinking there might be that if people get high,</v>

4720
02:22:03.531 --> 02:22:04.341
<v Speaker 2>they're drinking less,</v>

4721
02:22:04.341 --> 02:22:05.540
<v Speaker 2>spending less gambling,</v>

4722
02:22:05.541 --> 02:22:05.960
<v Speaker 2>less.</v>

4723
