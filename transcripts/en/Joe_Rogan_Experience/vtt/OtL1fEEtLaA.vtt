<v Speaker 2>they stabilized him.</v>

42
00:01:26.431 --> 00:01:26.941
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

43
00:01:26.941 --> 00:01:28.860
<v Speaker 2>we'll do this and we'll do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they did some,</v>

44
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Orthodox medical procedures all allowed</v>

45
00:01:34.021 --> 00:01:35.490
<v Speaker 2>in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

46
00:01:35.491 --> 00:01:36.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were great.</v>

47
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:38.663
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

48
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still had reservations about him</v>

49
00:01:40.711 --> 00:01:42.510
<v Speaker 2>getting a hip replacement because he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>old.</v>

50
00:01:42.511 --> 00:01:46.680
<v Speaker 2>And of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the recovery from a traumatic</v>

51
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.290
<v Speaker 2>surgery at that age is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a big deal.</v>

52
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:50.483
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

53
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:51.870
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

54
00:01:51.871 --> 00:01:53.070
<v Speaker 2>what can I do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my brother says,</v>

55
00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:54.960
<v Speaker 2>why don't you look into these adult stem</v>
<v Speaker 2>cells?</v>

56
00:01:54.961 --> 00:01:55.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you grow,</v>

59
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.640
<v Speaker 2>you grow a spare mouth on your head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ended up with an extra asshole or</v>

60
00:02:05.641 --> 00:02:07.440
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I was like,</v>

61
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:08.490
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll look into it.</v>

62
00:02:08.491 --> 00:02:09.870
<v Speaker 2>So we did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course,</v>

63
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.230
<v Speaker 2>a buddy of mine who was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was a Mayo Doc,</v>

00:04:07.361 --> 00:04:08.950
<v Speaker 3>what medications are you on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

124
00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:10.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm not on any.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they said,</v>

125
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.810
<v Speaker 3>you're 92 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you account for not being on any</v>

126
00:04:13.811 --> 00:04:16.270
<v Speaker 3>medications?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is because I stay away from doctors</v>

127
00:04:16.271 --> 00:04:19.330
<v Speaker 3>and hospitals</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

128
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.170
<v Speaker 3>and he didn't have any problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He started to have have a rough trip.</v>

129
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.550
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

130
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.560
<v Speaker 3>we took them down there and he got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

131
00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.200
<v Speaker 3>I think it was like a double dose in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>hip.</v>

132
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.710
<v Speaker 3>I think you have to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not legal in America,</v>

133
00:04:32.711 --> 00:04:35.710
<v Speaker 3>is that what's going on right now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are clinical trials going on in</v>

134
00:04:35.711 --> 00:04:37.540
<v Speaker 3>the u s but it's not broadly available.</v>

135
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.940
<v Speaker 3>And in Panama,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they passed the law in 2004,</v>

136
00:04:39.941 --> 00:04:42.580
<v Speaker 3>which allowed us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>allowed doctors actually to go down</v>

137
00:04:42.581 --> 00:04:46.690
<v Speaker 3>there to be able to treat people with</v>
<v Speaker 3>using adult stem cell.</v>

138
00:04:46.691 --> 00:04:49.390
<v Speaker 3>So the bill was actually designed to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

139
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.910
<v Speaker 3>to prohibit the use of embryonic stem</v>
<v Speaker 3>cells.</v>

140
00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.380
<v Speaker 3>And in at the same law,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they said it's okay to use adult stem</v>

141
00:04:56.381 --> 00:04:58.330
<v Speaker 3>cells,</v>
<v Speaker 3>including those from a biblical cord</v>

142
00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.480
<v Speaker 3>basically from ethical sources.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

143
00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.780
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Panama they gave us a,</v>

144
00:05:04.781 --> 00:05:08.200
<v Speaker 3>we have a license from the Ministry of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Health to manufacturer and use those</v>

145
00:05:08.201 --> 00:05:10.990
<v Speaker 3>cells in addition to doing clinical</v>
<v Speaker 3>trials there.</v>

146
00:05:10.991 --> 00:05:13.720
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's one place on the planet where you</v>

147
00:05:13.721 --> 00:05:16.300
<v Speaker 3>can get a really high quality umbilical</v>
<v Speaker 3>cord.</v>

148
00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:17.670
<v Speaker 3>These,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this type of cell,</v>

149
00:05:17.671 --> 00:05:20.380
<v Speaker 3>there are two major kinds of stem cells.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We only work with one kind.</v>

150
00:05:20.381 --> 00:05:22.360
<v Speaker 3>The missoulian Kamala,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we just call it the mic.</v>

151
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.550
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot easier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

152
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:25.450
<v Speaker 3>so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

153
00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.930
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how I think we were actually,</v>

154
00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.180
<v Speaker 3>we actually owned apartments in the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>building in Panama.</v>

155
00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:32.500
<v Speaker 3>Never met each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we met,</v>

156
00:05:32.501 --> 00:05:35.920
<v Speaker 3>we met through his brother finding us on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Internet and then you go,</v>

157
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.350
<v Speaker 3>and then they brought him down to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>treatment.</v>

158
00:05:38.351 --> 00:05:39.830
<v Speaker 3>We were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were quite hesitant to,</v>

159
00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:40.840
<v Speaker 3>to take him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

160
00:05:40.841 --> 00:05:42.050
<v Speaker 3>cause the last thing you don't want is</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mel,</v>

161
00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:46.510
<v Speaker 3>Mel Gibson's dad to drop down in your</v>
<v Speaker 3>clinic and he wasn't in great shape,</v>

162
00:05:46.511 --> 00:05:49.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he wasn't in good shape at all.</v>

163
00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:50.853
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

164
00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as I recall when he got there,</v>

165
00:05:52.631 --> 00:05:56.160
<v Speaker 3>he was in a wheelchair and really wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking a lot and things like that and</v>

166
00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:57.650
<v Speaker 3>having a pretty rough time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

167
00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:59.110
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

168
00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.880
<v Speaker 3>so we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after getting medical clearance for him</v>

169
00:06:01.881 --> 00:06:04.940
<v Speaker 3>to actually fly down there and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>Melflin down there privately,</v>

170
00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.000
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then we,</v>

171
00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:11.930
<v Speaker 3>we did some ivs on him first in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>clinic and then to do the hip,</v>

172
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.530
<v Speaker 3>we need to do that piece.</v>

173
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.700
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we give the umbilical cord,</v>

174
00:06:16.701 --> 00:06:17.540
<v Speaker 3>these are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are,</v>

175
00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:19.860
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isolated from the,</v>

176
00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:23.450
<v Speaker 3>the basically the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the meat of the umbilical cord.</v>

177
00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.310
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're isolated and they're grown in</v>

178
00:06:25.311 --> 00:06:30.311
<v Speaker 3>our laboratory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is iso 9,001 and very high quality</v>

179
00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:33.110
<v Speaker 3>and certified by the Ministry of Health.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

180
00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.390
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're grown in the laboratory and</v>

181
00:06:35.391 --> 00:06:38.870
<v Speaker 3>they're certified to be free of</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything and in any kind of infectious</v>

182
00:06:38.871 --> 00:06:39.620
<v Speaker 3>disease.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

183
00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:40.400
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

184
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.430
<v Speaker 3>I went into the clean rooms and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>make it put on hats and gloves and you</v>

185
00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.250
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you feel like all frankensteined out and</v>

186
00:06:46.251 --> 00:06:49.700
<v Speaker 3>you'll walk into these cold rooms and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're watching cells divided under the</v>

187
00:06:49.701 --> 00:06:51.320
<v Speaker 3>microscope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of miraculous.</v>

188
00:06:51.321 --> 00:06:55.360
<v Speaker 3>Really look at this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So intravenous stem cells intravenously.</v>

189
00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:56.500
<v Speaker 3>That's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what,</v>

190
00:06:56.501 --> 00:06:58.160
<v Speaker 3>what's the benefit of intravenous stem</v>
<v Speaker 3>cells?</v>

191
00:06:58.161 --> 00:06:59.330
<v Speaker 3>Like what does that do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

192
00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:01.980
<v Speaker 3>the good thing is that this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this kind of stem cell,</v>

193
00:07:01.981 --> 00:07:04.070
<v Speaker 3>the Mesenchymal stem cells are found</v>
<v Speaker 3>throughout your body.</v>

194
00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.290
<v Speaker 3>And they're the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>normally what they do is they,</v>

195
00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:09.680
<v Speaker 3>they modulate your immune system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they decrease inflammation,</v>

196
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:11.630
<v Speaker 3>and they stimulate regeneration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

197
00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:14.540
<v Speaker 3>and the good thing about them is they</v>
<v Speaker 3>tend to home to areas where there is</v>

198
00:07:14.541 --> 00:07:16.910
<v Speaker 3>inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So intravenously,</v>

199
00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:18.950
<v Speaker 3>they do a lot of things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

200
00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.720
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they can home to areas of</v>

201
00:07:20.721 --> 00:07:23.890
<v Speaker 3>inflammation and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they,</v>

202
00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:28.430
<v Speaker 3>they really reduce inflammation in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>body because they upregulate part of</v>

203
00:07:28.431 --> 00:07:32.000
<v Speaker 3>your immune system that controls the</v>
<v Speaker 3>inflammatory process,</v>

204
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:35.120
<v Speaker 3>which I can talk more about later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in his case,</v>

205
00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his kidneys were in trouble.</v>

206
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:40.580
<v Speaker 3>His heart was in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the cells,</v>

207
00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:44.180
<v Speaker 3>they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unlike what we used to think in the</v>

208
00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:45.500
<v Speaker 3>early days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't become anything.</v>

209
00:07:45.501 --> 00:07:47.900
<v Speaker 3>These kinds of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this kind of stem cell does not become</v>

210
00:07:47.901 --> 00:07:49.820
<v Speaker 3>anything in your body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at homestead,</v>

211
00:07:49.821 --> 00:07:53.930
<v Speaker 3>areas of that need repair and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>secretes things that stimulates the</v>

212
00:07:53.931 --> 00:07:57.530
<v Speaker 3>repair and decrease the inflammation and</v>
<v Speaker 3>helps out with the immune system.</v>

213
00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:00.530
<v Speaker 3>So the vast majority of what we treat</v>
<v Speaker 3>our autoimmune diseases,</v>

214
00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:01.800
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

215
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.900
<v Speaker 3>in [inaudible] case we gave him iv so</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

216
00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.630
<v Speaker 3>that he could basically have these</v>
<v Speaker 3>things on board,</v>

217
00:08:08.631 --> 00:08:12.320
<v Speaker 3>secreting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>secreting the cytokines and the,</v>

218
00:08:12.321 --> 00:08:14.690
<v Speaker 3>and the growth factors that are normally</v>
<v Speaker 3>secreted.</v>

219
00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.780
<v Speaker 3>And when you're 92 and you have</v>
<v Speaker 3>multiorgan failure,</v>

220
00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:22.370
<v Speaker 3>you're basically running on fumes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you put these days zero young,</v>

221
00:08:22.371 --> 00:08:26.840
<v Speaker 3>healthy cells and they secrete these</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that kind of restarts everything.</v>

222
00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:30.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so what was his response to this Ivy</v>

223
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:31.220
<v Speaker 3>Treatment?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

224
00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:32.150
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

225
00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:32.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

226
00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:35.180
<v Speaker 3>I could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can wax lyrical about that.</v>

227
00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:38.280
<v Speaker 3>He's almost a hundred years old and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

228
00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:41.330
<v Speaker 3>from pretty bad shape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like bee stings.</v>

229
00:08:41.331 --> 00:08:46.331
<v Speaker 3>It was like he got a new lease of life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he got a big dose locally in the</v>

230
00:08:46.521 --> 00:08:49.760
<v Speaker 3>hip,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which a fixed all his inflammation and</v>

231
00:08:49.761 --> 00:08:54.200
<v Speaker 3>pain and he started walking again and</v>
<v Speaker 3>his kidneys were good and his heart,</v>

232
00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.910
<v Speaker 3>he had a valves in there and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>healed.</v>

233
00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:59.040
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>

234
00:08:59.041 --> 00:09:01.440
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cognitive powers improved.</v>

235
00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.930
<v Speaker 3>His eyesight improved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

236
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:07.270
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and other stuff improved that I,</v>

237
00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:08.840
<v Speaker 3>he would hate me to talk about it.</v>

238
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.720
<v Speaker 1>Two nurses that reported to me and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

239
00:09:14.721 --> 00:09:19.040
<v Speaker 1>holy mackerel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>using it as a towel rack.</v>

240
00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:21.800
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dan Bilzerian was telling me about</v>

241
00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:23.270
<v Speaker 1>intravenous stem cells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

242
00:09:23.271 --> 00:09:24.960
<v Speaker 1>and so his boss route and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boss,</v>

243
00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:28.460
<v Speaker 1>former UFC heavyweight champion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he went down and caught some,</v>

244
00:09:28.461 --> 00:09:31.220
<v Speaker 1>he's had some pretty significant neck</v>
<v Speaker 1>injuries and neck fusions.</v>

245
00:09:31.221 --> 00:09:33.320
<v Speaker 1>And he said he got intravenous stem</v>
<v Speaker 1>cells.</v>

246
00:09:33.321 --> 00:09:35.490
<v Speaker 1>The way he described his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like with his Dutch accents,</v>

247
00:09:35.491 --> 00:09:38.300
<v Speaker 1>like it was like I had lightning coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>off my fingers.</v>

248
00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.070
<v Speaker 1>Did he go to you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

249
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:42.590
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

250
00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:43.910
<v Speaker 1>He said it was phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

251
00:09:43.911 --> 00:09:46.430
<v Speaker 1>he said it's one of the most incredible</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences I've ever had.</v>

252
00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:49.850
<v Speaker 1>The feeling of a regeneration of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of energy.</v>

253
00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:54.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I reach out to him by email and he,</v>

254
00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:58.330
<v Speaker 3>and just to see if it'd be okay for me</v>
<v Speaker 3>to talk about him on here.</v>

255
00:09:58.331 --> 00:09:59.021
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

256
00:09:59.021 --> 00:10:00.700
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

257
00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:01.613
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>

258
00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:04.600
<v Speaker 3>his cholesterol dropped all his numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

259
00:10:04.601 --> 00:10:07.930
<v Speaker 3>the basically numbers associated with</v>
<v Speaker 3>aging all got better.</v>

260
00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:09.480
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

261
00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:12.700
<v Speaker 3>and like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he felt this tremendous energy for some</v>

262
00:10:12.701 --> 00:10:14.260
<v Speaker 3>period of time wise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not legal here.</v>

263
00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:16.890
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

264
00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:20.230
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's considered to be a new drug by the</v>

265
00:10:20.231 --> 00:10:25.231
<v Speaker 3>FDA and that's the number one reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are four countries so far that</v>

266
00:10:25.661 --> 00:10:30.640
<v Speaker 3>have approved MSC products.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's Canada and New Zealand were the</v>

267
00:10:30.641 --> 00:10:33.130
<v Speaker 3>first to go to Canada and get this done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

268
00:10:33.131 --> 00:10:34.210
<v Speaker 3>not for the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>only,</v>

269
00:10:34.211 --> 00:10:36.340
<v Speaker 3>only for certain conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in Canada,</v>

270
00:10:36.341 --> 00:10:38.860
<v Speaker 3>New Zealand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they approved bone marrow mscs,</v>

271
00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:42.940
<v Speaker 3>which are in my mind are not as good as</v>
<v Speaker 3>umbilical cord.</v>

272
00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:44.860
<v Speaker 3>And I explain why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

273
00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:48.250
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then South Korea as approved</v>

274
00:10:48.251 --> 00:10:51.940
<v Speaker 3>umbilical cord for knee osteoarthritis</v>
<v Speaker 3>only so the cells have to be injected</v>

275
00:10:51.941 --> 00:10:55.120
<v Speaker 3>into the knee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then Japan just recently approved</v>

276
00:10:55.121 --> 00:10:56.490
<v Speaker 3>the same product.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

277
00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:00.010
<v Speaker 3>It's used to treat a very serious acute</v>
<v Speaker 3>graph,</v>

278
00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:05.170
<v Speaker 3>acute graft versus host disease in</v>
<v Speaker 3>children after they've had a bone marrow</v>

279
00:11:05.171 --> 00:11:05.800
<v Speaker 3>transplant.</v>

280
00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:10.270
<v Speaker 1>Now are there peer reviewed studies or</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that shows the efficacy of this</v>

281
00:11:10.271 --> 00:11:11.920
<v Speaker 1>intravenous use of these stem cells?</v>

282
00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:13.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

283
00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:16.090
<v Speaker 3>there are hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are hundreds and my book MSC,</v>

284
00:11:16.091 --> 00:11:16.990
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

285
00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:19.450
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to read it unless you</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to go to sleep unless you're</v>

286
00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:20.950
<v Speaker 3>looking for something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

287
00:11:20.951 --> 00:11:24.820
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it really is purely a research tool.</v>

288
00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.240
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have 800 references and we reference</v>

289
00:11:28.241 --> 00:11:31.300
<v Speaker 3>every clinical trial that's ever been</v>
<v Speaker 3>done with mscs and human beings and</v>

290
00:11:31.301 --> 00:11:32.670
<v Speaker 3>there are 800 of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

291
00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:35.700
<v Speaker 1>Well I've had some great results with</v>
<v Speaker 1>stem cells.</v>

292
00:11:35.701 --> 00:11:38.490
<v Speaker 1>Doctor Rati Mcgee in Las Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A shot,</v>

293
00:11:38.491 --> 00:11:42.030
<v Speaker 1>a bunch into my shoulder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was at the door of surgery.</v>

294
00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:44.280
<v Speaker 1>I was like my shoulders and pain all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

295
00:11:44.281 --> 00:11:46.110
<v Speaker 1>I can't do a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time I do something,</v>

296
00:11:46.111 --> 00:11:49.380
<v Speaker 1>I have to ice it down for a day and now</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have full function.</v>

297
00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:50.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>

298
00:11:50.641 --> 00:11:51.411
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was literally,</v>

299
00:11:51.411 --> 00:11:53.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean it still clicks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got some weird shit in there and</v>

300
00:11:53.831 --> 00:11:54.190
<v Speaker 1>there's probably</v>

301
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:57.400
<v Speaker 3>some stuff floating around in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But as far as like the function of my</v>

302
00:11:57.401 --> 00:11:59.230
<v Speaker 3>shoulder and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pain,</v>

303
00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:01.810
<v Speaker 3>it's like 100% I can do basically</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

304
00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:02.490
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

305
00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:03.090
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

306
00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:05.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was 57 58 years old and this is like</v>

307
00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:08.160
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four or five years ago?</v>

308
00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:11.790
<v Speaker 2>And both my shoulders torn labor rooms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>arthritis,</v>

309
00:12:11.791 --> 00:12:14.370
<v Speaker 2>bone spurs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like rotator cuff issues.</v>

310
00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:19.260
<v Speaker 2>And I went down and I got 10 billion</v>
<v Speaker 2>cells in each shoulder.</v>

311
00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:21.290
<v Speaker 2>I said to the doc,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

312
00:12:21.291 --> 00:12:22.350
<v Speaker 2>is this going to hurt?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he says,</v>

313
00:12:22.351 --> 00:12:26.330
<v Speaker 2>only when it comes out the other side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he put it in and it,</v>

314
00:12:26.331 --> 00:12:28.830
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could feel them pierce the capsule</v>

315
00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:32.850
<v Speaker 2>and you could feel pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

316
00:12:32.851 --> 00:12:34.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't flap my wings for three days,</v>

317
00:12:34.681 --> 00:12:36.570
<v Speaker 2>but after that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no more problems.</v>

318
00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:39.510
<v Speaker 3>And this is different than the stem</v>
<v Speaker 3>cells that you can get in the United</v>

319
00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:40.620
<v Speaker 3>States currently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

320
00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:44.550
<v Speaker 3>What's the difference</v>
<v Speaker 3>from umbilical cords?</v>

321
00:12:44.551 --> 00:12:46.260
<v Speaker 3>I had a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is it called?</v>

322
00:12:46.261 --> 00:12:48.180
<v Speaker 3>What's the kind that you can get here in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the United States?</v>

323
00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:49.740
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can use the only thing that's</v>

324
00:12:49.741 --> 00:12:53.250
<v Speaker 3>legally legal in the u s at least for</v>
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>

325
00:12:53.251 --> 00:12:55.920
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's going to be last much</v>
<v Speaker 3>longer as from amnion.</v>

326
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:58.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's an exemption in the,</v>

327
00:12:58.531 --> 00:13:01.980
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a federal federal exemption for the</v>

328
00:13:01.981 --> 00:13:05.430
<v Speaker 3>use of amnion for wound covering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of people have now translated,</v>

329
00:13:05.431 --> 00:13:08.940
<v Speaker 3>now they're using it in joints and</v>
<v Speaker 3>things like that.</v>

330
00:13:08.941 --> 00:13:11.520
<v Speaker 3>But you don't think they're going to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>able to do that very much longer?</v>

331
00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:12.810
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is that?</v>

332
00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:16.890
<v Speaker 3>Cause this commissioner FDA Commissioner</v>
<v Speaker 3>has made it very clear that he doesn't</v>

333
00:13:16.891 --> 00:13:20.430
<v Speaker 3>like it and they really haven't liked it</v>
<v Speaker 3>for quite some time.</v>

334
00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:21.840
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the,</v>

335
00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:24.060
<v Speaker 3>the exemption is for one thing and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

336
00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:27.240
<v Speaker 3>and doctors are using it for all kinds</v>
<v Speaker 3>of other things.</v>

337
00:13:27.241 --> 00:13:29.070
<v Speaker 3>I don't necessarily agree with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

338
00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:33.120
<v Speaker 3>I just know what's coming down the pike</v>
<v Speaker 3>from a regulatory standpoint.</v>

339
00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:34.301
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

340
00:13:34.301 --> 00:13:36.450
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there've been some regulatory things</v>

341
00:13:36.451 --> 00:13:38.970
<v Speaker 3>that have come out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've gone after clinics and you know,</v>

342
00:13:38.971 --> 00:13:43.230
<v Speaker 3>I think they've shut down three places</v>
<v Speaker 3>just in the last couple of months and</v>

343
00:13:43.231 --> 00:13:46.020
<v Speaker 3>they haven't gone after amnion yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think they're building their case</v>

344
00:13:46.021 --> 00:13:49.020
<v Speaker 3>for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And unfortunately that's what's going to</v>

345
00:13:49.021 --> 00:13:49.590
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

346
00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:51.840
<v Speaker 3>why would they go after it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what's confusing.</v>

347
00:13:51.841 --> 00:13:55.050
<v Speaker 3>If you seen all these benefits and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>haven't heard anything about negative</v>

348
00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:57.690
<v Speaker 3>results.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

349
00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:59.760
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand it myself,</v>

350
00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:00.790
<v Speaker 3>to be honest with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

351
00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:02.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>amnion it's been used clinically in the</v>

352
00:14:02.611 --> 00:14:04.710
<v Speaker 3>United States for over a hundred years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

353
00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:06.930
<v Speaker 3>without serious adverse events.</v>

354
00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:07.820
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

355
00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:11.260
<v Speaker 3>I think it's more about the claims that</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are making because they're,</v>

356
00:14:11.261 --> 00:14:13.920
<v Speaker 3>there haven't been studies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

357
00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:15.290
<v Speaker 3>of Amnion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

358
00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:20.190
<v Speaker 3>amnion tissue injected into a joint.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that the biggest concern is</v>

359
00:14:20.191 --> 00:14:23.440
<v Speaker 3>the claims that are being made and maybe</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are being vulnerably,</v>

360
00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:24.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>

361
00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:28.380
<v Speaker 3>some vulnerable to the economics of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not really sure,</v>

362
00:14:28.381 --> 00:14:32.780
<v Speaker 3>but I know that I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have my finger on the pulse and,</v>

363
00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:34.940
<v Speaker 3>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems like they're there.</v>

364
00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:36.960
<v Speaker 3>They've gone after fat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

365
00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:41.990
<v Speaker 3>we were the first in the world to use</v>
<v Speaker 3>fat derived stem cells in 2006 and 2007</v>

366
00:14:42.661 --> 00:14:47.661
<v Speaker 3>we published in on using those to treat</v>
<v Speaker 3>rheumatoid arthritis and multiple</v>

367
00:14:47.971 --> 00:14:52.040
<v Speaker 3>sclerosis a and then a lot of doctors in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the u s started doing that now.</v>

368
00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:56.360
<v Speaker 3>Now there's new guidance to industry</v>
<v Speaker 3>that came out a few months ago that</v>

369
00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:59.600
<v Speaker 3>specifically prohibits using it for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

370
00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:03.050
<v Speaker 3>taking your own fat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isolating the stem cells out of it,</v>

371
00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:07.280
<v Speaker 3>and then injecting them in your</v>
<v Speaker 3>bloodstream or even a document to a</v>

372
00:15:07.281 --> 00:15:08.114
<v Speaker 3>joint.</v>

373
00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:10.130
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

374
00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:11.173
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

375
00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:13.190
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't really know the whole,</v>

376
00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:16.460
<v Speaker 3>the motivation behind it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I know that they,</v>

377
00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:20.930
<v Speaker 3>they very clearly stated that that's not</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to fly anymore.</v>

378
00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:23.120
<v Speaker 3>So the stuff that you did for mel</v>
<v Speaker 3>shoulder,</v>

379
00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:24.770
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what exactly was that?</v>

380
00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:29.600
<v Speaker 3>That's basically a new drug product.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could be considered a new drug</v>

381
00:15:29.601 --> 00:15:32.420
<v Speaker 3>product in the U S and we are in</v>
<v Speaker 3>clinical trials in the U s we've</v>

382
00:15:32.421 --> 00:15:32.901
<v Speaker 3>already,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

383
00:15:32.901 --> 00:15:35.750
<v Speaker 3>we have to imds for the treatment</v>
<v Speaker 3>additions,</v>

384
00:15:35.751 --> 00:15:38.630
<v Speaker 3>muscular dystrophy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we're just going to start a spinal</v>

385
00:15:38.631 --> 00:15:40.610
<v Speaker 3>cord injury trial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>University of Miami.</v>

386
00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:42.400
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

387
00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:46.130
<v Speaker 3>Thomas Jefferson University.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got funding from the Marcus</v>

388
00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:48.450
<v Speaker 3>Foundation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bernie Marcus is one of our clients and</v>

389
00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:51.320
<v Speaker 3>he sees all these kids with spinal cord</v>
<v Speaker 3>injury getting better.</v>

390
00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:54.080
<v Speaker 3>And so our product is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

391
00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:57.110
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were able to figure out which cells</v>

392
00:15:57.111 --> 00:15:57.980
<v Speaker 3>work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>

393
00:15:57.981 --> 00:16:02.090
<v Speaker 3>which umbilical cords give cells that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are really useful and which ones aren't.</v>

394
00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:05.600
<v Speaker 3>So we throw away the vast majority of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the umbilical cords that we get.</v>

395
00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:07.430
<v Speaker 3>You tell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

396
00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:10.010
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we had the advantage of having thousands</v>

397
00:16:10.011 --> 00:16:11.690
<v Speaker 3>of cases and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'll get,</v>

398
00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:17.200
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you an example of one case of</v>
<v Speaker 3>a football coach from Dallas where I</v>

399
00:16:18.231 --> 00:16:21.530
<v Speaker 3>live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he had diagnosed with Ms. He was in</v>

400
00:16:21.531 --> 00:16:23.450
<v Speaker 3>and out of wheelchair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was on,</v>

401
00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:24.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>basically out.</v>

402
00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:26.420
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

403
00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:29.060
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was out on disability and retired</v>

404
00:16:29.061 --> 00:16:31.640
<v Speaker 3>from a very successful at three time</v>
<v Speaker 3>state champion in Texas.</v>

405
00:16:31.641 --> 00:16:33.740
<v Speaker 3>That's really saying something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

406
00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:39.610
<v Speaker 3>and he came down in 2010 for the first</v>
<v Speaker 3>treatment and we gave him the treatment</v>

407
00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:42.830
<v Speaker 3>and he got much better and improve for</v>
<v Speaker 3>about 14 months.</v>

408
00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:47.210
<v Speaker 3>And then he came back again in 2011 and</v>
<v Speaker 3>got another treatment improved,</v>

409
00:16:47.211 --> 00:16:52.211
<v Speaker 3>not as much as the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And He came down in 2012 and boom,</v>

410
00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:53.510
<v Speaker 3>all of his symptoms were gone.</v>

411
00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:57.440
<v Speaker 3>And now he's back coaching and he is</v>
<v Speaker 3>completely normal.</v>

412
00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:59.300
<v Speaker 3>He's probably,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

413
00:16:59.301 --> 00:17:00.680
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a junior,</v>

414
00:17:00.681 --> 00:17:02.900
<v Speaker 3>he's a bit younger than me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's probably healthier than me.</v>

415
00:17:02.901 --> 00:17:04.250
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy works out all the time.</v>

416
00:17:04.610 --> 00:17:07.220
<v Speaker 3>He's out there on the field.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't have any heat intolerance.</v>

417
00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:08.790
<v Speaker 3>It didn't have any problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

418
00:17:08.791 --> 00:17:12.710
<v Speaker 3>so I want her to know what's the</v>
<v Speaker 3>difference between those cells in 2012</v>

419
00:17:12.711 --> 00:17:16.550
<v Speaker 3>and the ones in 2011 and one of the 2010</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then we took other cases similar to</v>

420
00:17:16.551 --> 00:17:20.300
<v Speaker 3>that where we'd had less than</v>
<v Speaker 3>spectacular result.</v>

421
00:17:20.301 --> 00:17:22.220
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's still good results,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they weren't,</v>

422
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but boom.</v>

423
00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:29.150
<v Speaker 3>And so he took cells from those</v>
<v Speaker 3>different lots and we grew them up and</v>

424
00:17:29.151 --> 00:17:32.990
<v Speaker 3>then we had them analyze for 1200</v>
<v Speaker 3>different molecules that they express.</v>

425
00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:36.560
<v Speaker 3>And we found that these cells,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we call them our golden cells because</v>

426
00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:39.650
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just seem to work all the time.</v>

427
00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:42.920
<v Speaker 3>And we found that they under express</v>
<v Speaker 3>certain proteins.</v>

428
00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:45.590
<v Speaker 3>And then so early on in the culture</v>
<v Speaker 3>process,</v>

429
00:17:45.591 --> 00:17:47.030
<v Speaker 3>we can select for those and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

430
00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:49.140
<v Speaker 3>these are golden cells,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these aren't throw him out.</v>

431
00:17:49.141 --> 00:17:51.390
<v Speaker 3>And so he throw it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we throw a whole bunch out and we keep</v>

432
00:17:51.391 --> 00:17:53.070
<v Speaker 3>the golden cells and then we grow those</v>
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

433
00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:55.080
<v Speaker 3>And those are the only cells that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>use.</v>

434
00:17:55.081 --> 00:17:56.580
<v Speaker 3>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the big,</v>

435
00:17:57.150 --> 00:18:00.050
<v Speaker 3>the big difference in the advantage we</v>
<v Speaker 3>have is that we've had all those cases,</v>

436
00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:03.120
<v Speaker 3>we're able to look back retrospectively</v>
<v Speaker 3>at which sells,</v>

437
00:18:03.121 --> 00:18:06.150
<v Speaker 3>really work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then analyze them from a molecular basis</v>

438
00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:09.110
<v Speaker 3>and then now we can select using that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

439
00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:11.770
<v Speaker 1>when mel came in with his shoulder</v>
<v Speaker 1>injuries,</v>

440
00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:14.040
<v Speaker 1>June an MRI first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

441
00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:16.450
<v Speaker 1>he had one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we didn't do it there.</v>

442
00:18:16.451 --> 00:18:17.350
<v Speaker 1>But he had one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

443
00:18:17.351 --> 00:18:21.060
<v Speaker 1>let's do a follow up Mri.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We did not know a lot of,</v>

444
00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:22.280
<v Speaker 1>we do a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was great.</v>

445
00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:23.230
<v Speaker 1>So you don't even bother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is good.</v>

446
00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:25.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't bother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like my dad was walking with that</v>

447
00:18:25.661 --> 00:18:26.780
<v Speaker 1>pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

448
00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:29.200
<v Speaker 1>his hip was dissolved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was doing okay.</v>

449
00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:30.730
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

450
00:18:30.731 --> 00:18:33.280
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you still no problems with the</v>

451
00:18:33.281 --> 00:18:34.630
<v Speaker 1>shoulder?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long ago did you have that done?</v>

452
00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:35.381
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when was it?</v>

453
00:18:35.381 --> 00:18:36.280
<v Speaker 1>I had it done twice.</v>

454
00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:39.720
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went 18 months and then I started it</v>

455
00:18:39.721 --> 00:18:43.500
<v Speaker 3>started to return the symptoms of</v>
<v Speaker 3>discomfort,</v>

456
00:18:43.501 --> 00:18:46.590
<v Speaker 3>pain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I did it again and like,</v>

457
00:18:46.591 --> 00:18:48.870
<v Speaker 3>it's been like couple of years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost three years.</v>

458
00:18:48.871 --> 00:18:50.310
<v Speaker 3>It's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

459
00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:51.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

460
00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:53.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was really impressed with what I was</v>

461
00:18:53.811 --> 00:18:57.980
<v Speaker 1>able to get done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the stuff that I wish I had Dr.</v>

462
00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:00.740
<v Speaker 1>McGee telling me exactly what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stuff that he,</v>

463
00:19:00.741 --> 00:19:04.400
<v Speaker 1>they had done to me about a year and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>half ago is no longer available.</v>

464
00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:07.520
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they decided that it was considered a</v>

465
00:19:07.521 --> 00:19:09.350
<v Speaker 1>drug and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

466
00:19:09.351 --> 00:19:13.970
<v Speaker 1>they weren't allowing that form of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>amniotic stem cell treatment.</v>

467
00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:17.090
<v Speaker 1>So now there's a less effective but</v>
<v Speaker 1>still effective form.</v>

468
00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:19.580
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it seems like there is some sort of</v>

469
00:19:19.581 --> 00:19:22.280
<v Speaker 1>an effort afoot to diminish this in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>United States.</v>

470
00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:24.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I think they just want to control</v>

471
00:19:24.591 --> 00:19:25.440
<v Speaker 1>it and they want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

472
00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:29.060
<v Speaker 1>they want it all to go through their</v>
<v Speaker 1>deal and their process.</v>

473
00:19:29.061 --> 00:19:32.420
<v Speaker 1>But in the meantime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people are probably suffering</v>

474
00:19:32.421 --> 00:19:35.210
<v Speaker 1>from some pretty significant injuries</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they could deal with,</v>

475
00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:38.840
<v Speaker 1>with that far easier if this could</v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow or another be sped up.</v>

476
00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:40.760
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

477
00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:43.310
<v Speaker 1>So when did you start doing this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Down in Panama?</v>

478
00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:47.420
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we started there in 2006 and just</v>

479
00:19:47.421 --> 00:19:48.850
<v Speaker 1>because of the regulations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

480
00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:49.740
<v Speaker 1>We found out about how about</v>

481
00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:53.820
<v Speaker 3>the regulations around 2006 and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we went straight there and once we</v>

482
00:19:53.821 --> 00:19:58.230
<v Speaker 3>found that law,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the law was passed in 2004 and then we</v>

483
00:19:58.231 --> 00:20:00.150
<v Speaker 3>found out about it and we went down</v>
<v Speaker 3>there and,</v>

484
00:20:00.151 --> 00:20:01.720
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we built our lab out.</v>

485
00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:05.250
<v Speaker 3>We were actually functional in 2007.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

486
00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:07.710
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're having our 10 year anniversary.</v>

487
00:20:07.711 --> 00:20:09.810
<v Speaker 3>What's it like in Panama?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never been a Panama.</v>

488
00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:11.610
<v Speaker 3>Is it weird?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like it's cool.</v>

489
00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:13.140
<v Speaker 3>You like it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

490
00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:14.530
<v Speaker 3>It's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

491
00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:18.030
<v Speaker 3>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's real friendly with the u s I think</v>

492
00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:20.070
<v Speaker 3>that's the currency has been there as US</v>
<v Speaker 3>dollars.</v>

493
00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:21.240
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It goes further?</v>

494
00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:23.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They use US dollars.</v>

495
00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:24.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>

496
00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:25.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These US dollars.</v>

497
00:20:25.501 --> 00:20:30.430
<v Speaker 3>I mean we kind of ran that joint for</v>
<v Speaker 3>many years until 1999 when they would</v>

498
00:20:30.431 --> 00:20:34.260
<v Speaker 3>gave the canal back and that was pretty</v>
<v Speaker 3>much the vast majority of the economy.</v>

499
00:20:34.261 --> 00:20:37.200
<v Speaker 3>So when we gave that back to them then</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just kept the dollar.</v>

500
00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:39.000
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's been,</v>

501
00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:41.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the explosive growth,</v>

502
00:20:41.011 --> 00:20:42.640
<v Speaker 3>it looks like Miami now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

503
00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:45.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my bill at the building I live in is 70</v>

504
00:20:45.691 --> 00:20:47.560
<v Speaker 3>stories tall and it's not even the</v>
<v Speaker 3>building,</v>

505
00:20:47.561 --> 00:20:48.394
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's,</v>

506
00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:51.940
<v Speaker 3>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our clinic is on the 63rd floor of a 65</v>

507
00:20:51.941 --> 00:20:54.010
<v Speaker 3>story building and it just full of high</v>
<v Speaker 3>rises.</v>

508
00:20:54.011 --> 00:20:57.400
<v Speaker 3>And of course there's a little bit too</v>
<v Speaker 3>much traffic if you get that much</v>

509
00:20:57.401 --> 00:20:59.200
<v Speaker 3>concentration of people in one place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

510
00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:01.810
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fantastic restaurants,</v>

511
00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:03.880
<v Speaker 3>movie theaters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mall shopping,</v>

512
00:21:03.881 --> 00:21:05.440
<v Speaker 3>high end shopping malls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you name it,</v>

513
00:21:05.441 --> 00:21:07.240
<v Speaker 3>you got everything that you want down</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

514
00:21:07.241 --> 00:21:08.830
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd love to spend time,</v>

515
00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:11.560
<v Speaker 3>I spend a third of my time down there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's friendly and it's relative,</v>

516
00:21:11.561 --> 00:21:12.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not dangerous.</v>

517
00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:17.080
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you have people that you,</v>

518
00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:20.610
<v Speaker 3>that hear about you from the United</v>
<v Speaker 3>States and they find out about your,</v>

519
00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:23.020
<v Speaker 3>your treatment and then fly down to</v>
<v Speaker 3>Panama to get treated.</v>

520
00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:24.123
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

521
00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:28.150
<v Speaker 3>Not just the u s but probably the</v>
<v Speaker 3>majority of the clients are from the u s</v>

522
00:21:28.151 --> 00:21:32.380
<v Speaker 3>and then we'd have people from all other</v>
<v Speaker 3>places around the globe.</v>

523
00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:37.060
<v Speaker 3>Do you anticipate this moon back to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>United States in any way or is this</v>

524
00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:40.510
<v Speaker 3>something that the hurdles are so steep</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's going to take a long time?</v>

525
00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:42.850
<v Speaker 3>I think we're going to figure out a way</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do it.</v>

526
00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:45.460
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think ultimately we're going to do it.</v>

527
00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:46.440
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

528
00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:47.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just having,</v>

529
00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:50.950
<v Speaker 3>we were the first to get an eye to treat</v>
<v Speaker 3>a human being in the United States with</v>

530
00:21:50.951 --> 00:21:51.970
<v Speaker 3>these cells.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

531
00:21:51.971 --> 00:21:53.630
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was three and a half years ago with</v>

532
00:21:53.631 --> 00:21:55.870
<v Speaker 3>the young man with the shins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>muscular dystrophy.</v>

533
00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:56.950
<v Speaker 3>And My,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

534
00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:59.770
<v Speaker 3>my other book that's hopefully</v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting to read.</v>

535
00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:02.350
<v Speaker 3>It starts and finishes with his case</v>
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>

536
00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:03.611
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were,</v>

537
00:22:03.611 --> 00:22:06.850
<v Speaker 3>we traded him in Panama for a number of</v>
<v Speaker 3>years and then we just petitioned the</v>

538
00:22:06.851 --> 00:22:08.890
<v Speaker 3>FDA and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of ridiculous for us to do</v>

539
00:22:08.891 --> 00:22:10.810
<v Speaker 3>this down there.</v>

540
00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:13.720
<v Speaker 3>Please allow us to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're using the cells that we,</v>

541
00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:16.480
<v Speaker 3>we isolated and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>expanded in Panama.</v>

542
00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:19.030
<v Speaker 3>We're using it to treat him and another,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

543
00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:21.880
<v Speaker 3>now a seven year old with Duchenne's</v>
<v Speaker 3>muscular dystrophy.</v>

544
00:22:21.881 --> 00:22:25.990
<v Speaker 3>So that was the first wedge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then our next wedge is going to be</v>

545
00:22:25.991 --> 00:22:27.960
<v Speaker 3>for spinal cord injury.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

546
00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:30.760
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there a number of clinical trials that</v>

547
00:22:30.761 --> 00:22:31.890
<v Speaker 3>are going on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

548
00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:36.430
<v Speaker 3>not just outside the u s are a number of</v>
<v Speaker 3>going on in the u s the biggest hurdle</v>

549
00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:40.390
<v Speaker 3>is that a new drug,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look at the last several years,</v>

550
00:22:40.391 --> 00:22:43.540
<v Speaker 3>cost two and a half billion dollars to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get to market.</v>

551
00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:45.160
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

552
00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:48.280
<v Speaker 3>unless we do something a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 3>differently on the regulatory side,</v>

553
00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:50.830
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's gonna be Kinda hard to do this.</v>

554
00:22:50.831 --> 00:22:55.831
<v Speaker 3>Japan has a law that went into effect</v>
<v Speaker 3>two years ago that basically allows you,</v>

555
00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:59.440
<v Speaker 3>allows you to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once you demonstrate your product is</v>

556
00:22:59.441 --> 00:23:01.330
<v Speaker 3>safe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you can go ahead and start</v>

557
00:23:01.331 --> 00:23:03.670
<v Speaker 3>marketing it and then you have seven</v>
<v Speaker 3>years in which to,</v>

558
00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:05.860
<v Speaker 3>to demonstrate efficacy.</v>

559
00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:07.870
<v Speaker 3>So safety first,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then efficacy,</v>

560
00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:11.860
<v Speaker 3>and that's resulted in four,</v>
<v Speaker 3>four new drugs already and in less than</v>

561
00:23:11.861 --> 00:23:13.200
<v Speaker 3>two years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

562
00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:17.830
<v Speaker 3>we have zero zero cell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only sell product that's,</v>

563
00:23:17.831 --> 00:23:21.620
<v Speaker 3>that's approved by FDA as umbilical cord</v>
<v Speaker 3>blood for the treatment of,</v>

564
00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:23.260
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're doing a bone marrow</v>

565
00:23:23.261 --> 00:23:24.910
<v Speaker 3>transplant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the only thing that's approved.</v>

566
00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:28.210
<v Speaker 3>Now is there an argument for that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they just being cautious,</v>

567
00:23:28.211 --> 00:23:31.090
<v Speaker 3>they want to make sure that there's no</v>
<v Speaker 3>adverse side effects that could really</v>

568
00:23:31.091 --> 00:23:33.070
<v Speaker 3>be significant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

569
00:23:33.071 --> 00:23:35.950
<v Speaker 3>I think there is an argument there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's an argument that they want it.</v>

570
00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:39.370
<v Speaker 3>They want to err on the side of safety.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's their number one priority</v>

571
00:23:39.371 --> 00:23:41.020
<v Speaker 3>is to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is to create,</v>

572
00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:44.410
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>create a safe environment for receiving</v>

573
00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:46.640
<v Speaker 3>medicines in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the United States.</v>

574
00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:48.220
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

575
00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:52.460
<v Speaker 3>I think the model is a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a little bit antiquated for the</v>

576
00:23:52.461 --> 00:23:55.310
<v Speaker 3>cell products just because they are</v>
<v Speaker 3>natural products.</v>

577
00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:57.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you think about it,</v>

578
00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:59.570
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every woman that's ever given birth to a</v>

579
00:23:59.571 --> 00:24:02.060
<v Speaker 3>baby,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have stem cells from their baby in</v>

580
00:24:02.061 --> 00:24:03.830
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These MSC is,</v>

581
00:24:03.831 --> 00:24:07.340
<v Speaker 3>you can find them 50 years later and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not toxic.</v>

582
00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:12.390
<v Speaker 3>And we wouldn't exist as a species if</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is a inherent toxicity to a</v>

583
00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:16.460
<v Speaker 3>genetically distinct cells because the</v>
<v Speaker 3>cells are 50% mom,</v>

584
00:24:16.461 --> 00:24:20.060
<v Speaker 3>50% dad and there you can find them in</v>
<v Speaker 3>mom,</v>

585
00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:22.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for her entire life.</v>

586
00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:24.740
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the,</v>

587
00:24:24.741 --> 00:24:28.010
<v Speaker 3>and the cures act was supposed to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're supposed to address some of that</v>

588
00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:31.340
<v Speaker 3>and we'll see that that went into effect</v>
<v Speaker 3>last year and we'll see,</v>

589
00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:33.980
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>going forward if that actually does</v>

590
00:24:33.981 --> 00:24:34.820
<v Speaker 3>affect things.</v>

591
00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:38.690
<v Speaker 1>Now I know that they're doing some stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the United States where they're</v>

592
00:24:38.691 --> 00:24:42.680
<v Speaker 1>injecting them into disks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a new thing to regenerate disc</v>

593
00:24:42.681 --> 00:24:46.970
<v Speaker 1>tissue for people that have degenerative</v>
<v Speaker 1>disc disease and bulging discs and disc</v>

594
00:24:46.971 --> 00:24:51.080
<v Speaker 1>injuries and a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an alternative to either artificial</v>

595
00:24:51.081 --> 00:24:54.770
<v Speaker 1>discs or fusion as a first step before</v>
<v Speaker 1>they move into those.</v>

596
00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:56.300
<v Speaker 1>Do you do any of that down there?</v>

597
00:24:56.370 --> 00:24:58.710
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't do any right now.</v>

598
00:24:58.740 --> 00:24:59.573
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

599
00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:01.600
<v Speaker 3>we're working with a hospital that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

600
00:25:01.601 --> 00:25:05.610
<v Speaker 3>we're actually going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to have a room just for</v>

601
00:25:05.611 --> 00:25:06.780
<v Speaker 3>doing backs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

602
00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:10.350
<v Speaker 3>just for doing spine because there are</v>
<v Speaker 3>study that has study out of Europe.</v>

603
00:25:10.351 --> 00:25:14.880
<v Speaker 3>Just came out a couple of months ago and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it showed about 50% of the patients had</v>

604
00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:19.020
<v Speaker 3>their disks become normal on Mri after</v>
<v Speaker 3>treatment.</v>

605
00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:21.300
<v Speaker 3>So it's not every case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I would,</v>

606
00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:23.460
<v Speaker 3>I'd take a 50,</v>
<v Speaker 3>50 shot versus having a,</v>

607
00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:24.810
<v Speaker 3>having a fusion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

608
00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the same sort of situation</v>

609
00:25:26.561 --> 00:25:29.290
<v Speaker 1>that we're talking about where you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>injecting it right into the desks.</v>

610
00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:31.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you can,</v>

611
00:25:31.001 --> 00:25:31.990
<v Speaker 3>in the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

612
00:25:31.991 --> 00:25:34.300
<v Speaker 3>we have a clinic in Dallas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

613
00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:39.660
<v Speaker 3>that the RMI clinic where we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can do bone marrow,</v>

614
00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:40.740
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

615
00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:43.150
<v Speaker 3>and so we use bone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>autologous bone marrow,</v>

616
00:25:43.151 --> 00:25:47.680
<v Speaker 3>and we do do disc in the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it does help a percentage of people</v>

617
00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:50.050
<v Speaker 3>doesn't help everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like we were talking before about</v>

618
00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:53.950
<v Speaker 3>not just not just the desk but the</v>
<v Speaker 3>muscles around the desk.</v>

619
00:25:53.951 --> 00:25:55.900
<v Speaker 3>So if you take somebody who's had an</v>
<v Speaker 3>injury,</v>

620
00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:57.220
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my partner,</v>

621
00:25:57.221 --> 00:26:01.600
<v Speaker 3>Dr Mckenna is a orthopedic surgeon and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's been talking about this for years.</v>

622
00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:05.140
<v Speaker 3>But if you take somebody with a disc</v>
<v Speaker 3>injury and you look at the muscles right</v>

623
00:26:05.141 --> 00:26:08.710
<v Speaker 3>on either side of the spine there and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll find that they're withered away</v>

624
00:26:08.711 --> 00:26:10.920
<v Speaker 3>or they're marbled with fat and that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that sort of thing,</v>

625
00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:13.300
<v Speaker 3>you take an elite athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's super healthy,</v>

626
00:26:13.301 --> 00:26:14.134
<v Speaker 3>works out all the time.</v>

627
00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:15.670
<v Speaker 3>Those muscles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>

628
00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:18.130
<v Speaker 3>they're like ropes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a full light Manyana the human</v>

629
00:26:18.131 --> 00:26:18.964
<v Speaker 3>body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

630
00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:21.790
<v Speaker 3>And you look at that and they're just</v>
<v Speaker 3>black on Mri,</v>

631
00:26:21.791 --> 00:26:25.600
<v Speaker 3>but you take somebody that's had a disc</v>
<v Speaker 3>injury at any level and you can look and</v>

632
00:26:25.601 --> 00:26:28.660
<v Speaker 3>there's marbling in there and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>withered and that sort of thing.</v>

633
00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:30.190
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

634
00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:35.310
<v Speaker 3>one of the things we do in South Lake in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dallas is we inject the desk but also</v>

635
00:26:35.771 --> 00:26:38.770
<v Speaker 3>inject those muscles along the side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's using your own bone marrow.</v>

636
00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:41.110
<v Speaker 3>And that's still allowed in the United</v>
<v Speaker 3>States.</v>

637
00:26:41.111 --> 00:26:45.660
<v Speaker 3>So the bone marrow draw the concentrate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the stem cells inject him in those</v>

638
00:26:45.661 --> 00:26:45.950
<v Speaker 3>areas.</v>

639
00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:47.060
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's something that we were talking</v>

640
00:26:47.061 --> 00:26:50.030
<v Speaker 2>about earlier when I showed you the</v>
<v Speaker 2>reverse hyper when I showed you that</v>

641
00:26:50.031 --> 00:26:52.880
<v Speaker 2>machine and then that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Dex back stretcher.</v>

642
00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:55.950
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a significant part of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>injuries that you see with people with</v>

643
00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:57.770
<v Speaker 2>discs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with back injuries.</v>

644
00:26:57.890 --> 00:26:59.630
<v Speaker 2>They don't have strong backs right</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

645
00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:02.330
<v Speaker 2>The tissue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the muscle around the back that protects</v>

646
00:27:02.331 --> 00:27:03.650
<v Speaker 2>the spine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just very weak.</v>

647
00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:04.640
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

648
00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:06.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fantastic machine.</v>

649
00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:07.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

650
00:27:07.281 --> 00:27:09.530
<v Speaker 2>you got to get one or two mil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

651
00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:12.110
<v Speaker 2>I've got a crazy back dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That picture you showed me your back is</v>

652
00:27:12.111 --> 00:27:13.360
<v Speaker 2>fucking banana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

653
00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:15.920
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like out of a nursery rhyme.</v>

654
00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:19.490
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that what I had done down in Texas</v>

655
00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:23.330
<v Speaker 2>with the bone marrow?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mel Actually had that done yet in Texas.</v>

656
00:27:23.331 --> 00:27:24.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many treatments have you had</v>

657
00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:27.290
<v Speaker 2>while there was that one?</v>

658
00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:32.380
<v Speaker 2>And then I had the shoulders twice and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I just had him drop it into my</v>

659
00:27:32.811 --> 00:27:33.644
<v Speaker 2>vein,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

660
00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:35.260
<v Speaker 2>just run around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's that like?</v>

661
00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:36.860
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

662
00:27:36.861 --> 00:27:40.760
<v Speaker 2>you feel a little sleepy for a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 2>days and then you feel pretty energetic,</v>

663
00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:42.410
<v Speaker 2>really sleepy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

664
00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:44.900
<v Speaker 2>It kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it takes its toll on you.</v>

665
00:27:44.901 --> 00:27:46.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

666
00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:49.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why you feel sleepy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Neil may have an explanation for that,</v>

667
00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:51.480
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well like two,</v>

668
00:27:51.490 --> 00:27:54.590
<v Speaker 2>three days where the cells are good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they kind of reeducate the immune</v>

669
00:27:54.591 --> 00:27:55.250
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

670
00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:57.630
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of what we treat our</v>
<v Speaker 2>rheumatory right.</v>

671
00:27:57.830 --> 00:28:00.630
<v Speaker 3>Artists and multiple sclerosis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>autoimmune diseases,</v>

672
00:28:00.650 --> 00:28:03.560
<v Speaker 3>and there's a retraining that's going on</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the immune system.</v>

673
00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:05.780
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that,</v>

674
00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:09.140
<v Speaker 3>that involves cytokines and those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those molecules,</v>

675
00:28:09.141 --> 00:28:11.360
<v Speaker 3>those peptides are the things that make</v>
<v Speaker 3>you feel sick.</v>

676
00:28:11.361 --> 00:28:12.560
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you get the flu,</v>

677
00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:16.400
<v Speaker 3>the flu virus doesn't make you sick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's your body's immune reaction to</v>

678
00:28:16.401 --> 00:28:18.860
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the stuff that's being thrown off</v>

679
00:28:18.861 --> 00:28:20.210
<v Speaker 3>from the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the fight.</v>

680
00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:22.220
<v Speaker 3>That's what actually makes you feel</v>
<v Speaker 3>sick.</v>

681
00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:25.200
<v Speaker 3>And so when you're activating certain</v>
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

682
00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:27.920
<v Speaker 3>parts of the immune system and they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>throwing off things can make you a</v>

683
00:28:27.921 --> 00:28:29.060
<v Speaker 3>little bit tired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people,</v>

684
00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:32.720
<v Speaker 3>very small percentage have some flu like</v>
<v Speaker 3>symptoms for one day,</v>

685
00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:36.130
<v Speaker 3>but those are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's kind of like the extent of the</v>

686
00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:39.000
<v Speaker 3>side effects that we typically see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you,</v>

687
00:28:39.001 --> 00:28:43.130
<v Speaker 3>if you look at like you ask why hasn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>been being done us,</v>

688
00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:44.600
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

689
00:28:44.601 --> 00:28:45.950
<v Speaker 3>for rheumatic drugs.</v>

690
00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:47.660
<v Speaker 3>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see them on TV,</v>

691
00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:51.530
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're advertised basically every hour</v>

692
00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:55.670
<v Speaker 3>of every day on almost every station and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see these antirheumatics and you</v>

693
00:28:55.671 --> 00:28:57.140
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have rheumatoid arthritis,</v>

694
00:28:57.150 --> 00:28:59.750
<v Speaker 3>if you have psoriatic arthritis or this</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of thing,</v>

695
00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:02.000
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are biologics and these are</v>

696
00:29:02.001 --> 00:29:05.060
<v Speaker 3>antibodies to a certain molecule called</v>
<v Speaker 3>TNF.</v>

697
00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:07.340
<v Speaker 3>TNF is one of the commanders of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>immune system.</v>

698
00:29:07.341 --> 00:29:07.971
<v Speaker 3>It kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it says,</v>

699
00:29:07.971 --> 00:29:09.170
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>

700
00:29:09.171 --> 00:29:11.600
<v Speaker 3>let's cause a bunch of inflammation and</v>
<v Speaker 3>make you miserable.</v>

701
00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:13.460
<v Speaker 3>And so the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

702
00:29:13.461 --> 00:29:18.461
<v Speaker 3>these drugs basically bind up or sop up</v>
<v Speaker 3>the TNF that's in your body for a period</v>

703
00:29:19.161 --> 00:29:20.750
<v Speaker 3>of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why you have to get retreated</v>

704
00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:22.340
<v Speaker 3>like every month,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every six months,</v>

705
00:29:22.341 --> 00:29:24.020
<v Speaker 3>every two months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something like that,</v>

706
00:29:24.021 --> 00:29:25.310
<v Speaker 3>six weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two months,</v>

707
00:29:25.850 --> 00:29:27.890
<v Speaker 3>and you have to get retrained and</v>
<v Speaker 3>retreated.</v>

708
00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:30.770
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a study of rheumatoid arthritis</v>

709
00:29:30.771 --> 00:29:33.710
<v Speaker 3>where they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was 172 people that were already on,</v>

710
00:29:33.910 --> 00:29:36.170
<v Speaker 3>on medication for the rheumatoid</v>
<v Speaker 3>arthritis,</v>

711
00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:37.850
<v Speaker 3>not adequately controlled.</v>

712
00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:41.860
<v Speaker 3>They gave him like the equivalent of</v>
<v Speaker 3>what a typical we give him.</v>

713
00:29:41.861 --> 00:29:46.000
<v Speaker 3>Panama is like roughly 120 million cells</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all of them got better.</v>

714
00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:48.640
<v Speaker 3>All of them symptomatically improved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

715
00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:53.380
<v Speaker 3>and the cool thing was that that tnf</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alpha and another molecule similar,</v>

716
00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:57.480
<v Speaker 3>similar to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>decreased by 50% and that decreased</v>

717
00:29:57.481 --> 00:29:59.950
<v Speaker 3>persisted for eight and a half months</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was linked to the study.</v>

718
00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:05.220
<v Speaker 3>So rather than putting an antibody in</v>
<v Speaker 3>two to sop up what's being produced,</v>

719
00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:10.000
<v Speaker 3>apparently by your immune system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

720
00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:13.300
<v Speaker 3>the cells tell your immune system to</v>
<v Speaker 3>stop it,</v>

721
00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:14.470
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The cells,</v>

722
00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:19.090
<v Speaker 3>they up a certain immune cell called the</v>
<v Speaker 3>t regulatory cell that says to the</v>

723
00:30:19.091 --> 00:30:19.924
<v Speaker 3>immune system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

724
00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:23.100
<v Speaker 3>quit making tnf alpha.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Queet quit making this [inaudible]</v>

725
00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:25.300
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they took 30 patients,</v>

726
00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:28.780
<v Speaker 3>a sub cohort like three months later and</v>
<v Speaker 3>gave him another shot,</v>

727
00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:31.600
<v Speaker 3>the same dose and it dropped their</v>
<v Speaker 3>levels,</v>

728
00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:34.810
<v Speaker 3>another 50% from that baseline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So from,</v>

729
00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:39.070
<v Speaker 3>from baseline to post second treatment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two treatments to ib,</v>

730
00:30:39.071 --> 00:30:40.930
<v Speaker 3>sitting in a chair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

731
00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:42.790
<v Speaker 3>dropped their levels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>75%.</v>

732
00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:46.420
<v Speaker 3>It just seems like something that would</v>
<v Speaker 3>be amazing for overall repair.</v>

733
00:30:46.550 --> 00:30:51.110
<v Speaker 2>Like just go down there and let your</v>
<v Speaker 2>body just get a little dose of healing</v>

734
00:30:51.111 --> 00:30:53.260
<v Speaker 2>to figure out what the fuck is wrong</v>
<v Speaker 2>with them.</v>

735
00:30:53.930 --> 00:30:58.040
<v Speaker 2>We'll talk about like we talked about</v>
<v Speaker 2>something and Costa Rica,</v>

736
00:30:58.041 --> 00:31:01.130
<v Speaker 2>we were both there and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had uh,</v>

737
00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:02.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

738
00:31:02.301 --> 00:31:05.030
<v Speaker 2>they looked at my neck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a 50% occlusion in the right</v>

739
00:31:05.031 --> 00:31:06.170
<v Speaker 2>carotid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

740
00:31:06.410 --> 00:31:08.360
<v Speaker 2>like build up of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

741
00:31:08.390 --> 00:31:10.400
<v Speaker 2>like you don't feel it happening all of</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sudden,</v>

742
00:31:10.401 --> 00:31:12.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden when your carotids is</v>

743
00:31:12.911 --> 00:31:13.790
<v Speaker 2>shut down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they think,</v>

744
00:31:13.791 --> 00:31:15.590
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to eat the statens,</v>

745
00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:16.520
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

746
00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:20.780
<v Speaker 2>Like crystal or lipitor and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I looked at what the side effects of</v>

747
00:31:20.781 --> 00:31:22.010
<v Speaker 2>those things are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

748
00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:24.380
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather die than eat those things.</v>

749
00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:25.401
<v Speaker 2>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

750
00:31:25.401 --> 00:31:26.930
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they try and make you feel guilty</v>

751
00:31:26.931 --> 00:31:28.220
<v Speaker 2>for not doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got kids,</v>

752
00:31:28.221 --> 00:31:28.821
<v Speaker 2>you got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

753
00:31:28.821 --> 00:31:29.654
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eh,</v>

754
00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:31.430
<v Speaker 2>but it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

755
00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:36.350
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have that stuff now and I didn't</v>

756
00:31:36.351 --> 00:31:40.700
<v Speaker 2>get anyone to go in and remove it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know if I can attribute that</v>

757
00:31:40.701 --> 00:31:44.210
<v Speaker 2>to the cells,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I got a bunch of cells like twice</v>

758
00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:48.470
<v Speaker 2>and that went away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I talk about that for a minute.</v>

759
00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:49.820
<v Speaker 2>Does that sort of a,</v>

760
00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:50.861
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

761
00:31:50.861 --> 00:31:52.050
<v Speaker 3>just in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in general,</v>

762
00:31:52.051 --> 00:31:54.240
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your body,</v>

763
00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:58.680
<v Speaker 3>you have a certain number of these cells</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're born and they age just like</v>

764
00:31:58.681 --> 00:32:01.660
<v Speaker 3>the rest of your body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they,</v>

765
00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:05.220
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they perform more poorly as you age,</v>

766
00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:07.710
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you take one of these cells from a</v>

767
00:32:07.711 --> 00:32:09.150
<v Speaker 3>newborn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when you were born,</v>

768
00:32:09.151 --> 00:32:11.760
<v Speaker 3>you could pluck one of these cells out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>throw it in a petri dish and let it</v>

769
00:32:11.761 --> 00:32:13.830
<v Speaker 3>grow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You let it grow for a month.</v>

770
00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:17.760
<v Speaker 3>It divides roughly every 24 hours or</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the doubling rate.</v>

771
00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:22.530
<v Speaker 3>So at the end of a month you have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>billion cells and then at at,</v>

772
00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:25.470
<v Speaker 3>if you take from a 35 year old and do</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same thing,</v>

773
00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:28.080
<v Speaker 3>it's doubling times like two days</v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of one day.</v>

774
00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:32.610
<v Speaker 3>And at the end of the month you have</v>
<v Speaker 3>32,000 cells and you take them from a 65</v>

775
00:32:32.611 --> 00:32:36.900
<v Speaker 3>year old who's relatively healthy and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they divide every 60 hours.</v>

776
00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:38.880
<v Speaker 3>You get 200 cells at the end of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>month.</v>

777
00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:43.700
<v Speaker 3>So if your problem is a thousand cells</v>
<v Speaker 3>or it's 20,000 cells or if it's a</v>

778
00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:46.700
<v Speaker 3>million cells,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't get it done at past a certain</v>

779
00:32:46.701 --> 00:32:48.140
<v Speaker 3>age.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just because it sells don't have the</v>

780
00:32:48.141 --> 00:32:51.080
<v Speaker 3>regenerative capacity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the good thing about the umbilical</v>

781
00:32:51.081 --> 00:32:55.400
<v Speaker 3>cord cells is they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you co culture them with these older</v>

782
00:32:55.401 --> 00:32:58.430
<v Speaker 3>people cells with the young cells,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't even have to touch each</v>

783
00:32:58.431 --> 00:33:00.470
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just the secretions of the young cells</v>

784
00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:04.400
<v Speaker 3>will make the young,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the old cells start dividing faster and</v>

785
00:33:04.401 --> 00:33:07.430
<v Speaker 3>behaving younger and the Mitochondria to</v>
<v Speaker 3>see pictures.</v>

786
00:33:07.431 --> 00:33:12.431
<v Speaker 3>And in my book you can see a picture of</v>
<v Speaker 3>of cells from a 65 year old diabetic and</v>

787
00:33:13.761 --> 00:33:16.640
<v Speaker 3>without any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>without any juice on them.</v>

788
00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:20.570
<v Speaker 3>And then you put the juice from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>young cells on there and they look like</v>

789
00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:23.990
<v Speaker 3>18 year old mscs with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the functional Mitochondria,</v>

790
00:33:23.991 --> 00:33:26.720
<v Speaker 3>Mitochondria all throughout the cell</v>
<v Speaker 3>body rather than all bunched up.</v>

791
00:33:27.050 --> 00:33:28.480
<v Speaker 3>They have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they look health.</v>

792
00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:30.290
<v Speaker 3>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean as a cell biologist,</v>

793
00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:33.640
<v Speaker 3>I know what looks healthy and anybody</v>
<v Speaker 3>else would you,</v>

794
00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:37.400
<v Speaker 3>you can see just from the picture how</v>
<v Speaker 3>vastly different it is just to be</v>

795
00:33:37.401 --> 00:33:39.800
<v Speaker 3>exposed to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the juice.</v>

796
00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:40.761
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

797
00:33:40.761 --> 00:33:43.940
<v Speaker 3>you said heard of this pair of biosis</v>
<v Speaker 3>study they did at Harvard where they</v>

798
00:33:43.941 --> 00:33:47.100
<v Speaker 3>took young minds and young minds and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

799
00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:50.630
<v Speaker 3>and they sewed them together with old</v>
<v Speaker 3>mice and then the old mice actually got</v>

800
00:33:50.631 --> 00:33:55.631
<v Speaker 3>younger and use the blood of the young</v>
<v Speaker 3>mice and put it in the old mice.</v>

801
00:33:55.910 --> 00:33:59.990
<v Speaker 3>Well they literally sewed them together</v>
<v Speaker 3>so their bodies together so their bodies</v>

802
00:33:59.991 --> 00:34:01.850
<v Speaker 3>together and so their bloodstreams</v>
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>

803
00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:05.060
<v Speaker 3>Oh Geez.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That the bloodstream is mixing and so</v>

804
00:34:05.061 --> 00:34:07.610
<v Speaker 3>that the young Frankenstein Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

805
00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:09.470
<v Speaker 3>Pretty Frankie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they,</v>

806
00:34:09.471 --> 00:34:10.670
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so at the end,</v>

807
00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:12.350
<v Speaker 3>at the end of the study,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they showed that,</v>

808
00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:13.440
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

809
00:34:13.470 --> 00:34:15.290
<v Speaker 3>that the older,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the older mice got,</v>

810
00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:19.160
<v Speaker 3>their neurologic system got better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cardiovascular system got better,</v>

811
00:34:19.161 --> 00:34:21.140
<v Speaker 3>skeletal muscle got better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything got better.</v>

812
00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:24.440
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and one of the key molecules in there,</v>

813
00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:28.730
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is called GDF 11 and GDF 11 is if we,</v>

814
00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:32.270
<v Speaker 3>when we look at the secret home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what the cells secrete when</v>

815
00:34:32.271 --> 00:34:34.970
<v Speaker 3>they're growing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we pull that out and we quantify it</v>

816
00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:38.600
<v Speaker 3>in the top four every time as GDF 11</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the golden cells.</v>

817
00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:41.240
<v Speaker 3>So the golden cells or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or producing GDF 11,</v>

818
00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:44.840
<v Speaker 3>which is one of the key molecules for</v>
<v Speaker 3>stimulating regeneration in your body.</v>

819
00:34:45.170 --> 00:34:49.520
<v Speaker 3>So what other auto immune diseases do</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think could be assisted by this?</v>

820
00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:51.190
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

821
00:34:51.870 --> 00:34:52.540
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

822
00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:55.610
<v Speaker 3>we do a lot of Ms. Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's probably our number one</v>

823
00:34:55.611 --> 00:34:57.590
<v Speaker 3>indication.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just finished a clinical trial,</v>

824
00:34:57.830 --> 00:35:00.350
<v Speaker 3>prospective clinical trial we submitted</v>
<v Speaker 3>for publication.</v>

825
00:35:00.351 --> 00:35:03.020
<v Speaker 3>It should be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it should be coming out in the next</v>

826
00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:04.070
<v Speaker 3>month or so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

827
00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:05.293
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

828
00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:08.630
<v Speaker 3>and statistically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>significantly the,</v>

829
00:35:08.730 --> 00:35:11.030
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these patients improved dramatically.</v>

830
00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:14.620
<v Speaker 3>And as far as side effect profile is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was highly minimal and me feel</v>

831
00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:16.920
<v Speaker 3>headaches and phew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>phew,</v>

832
00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:18.280
<v Speaker 3>flu like symptoms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things like that.</v>

833
00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:21.560
<v Speaker 3>But this was what 20 people and one of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

834
00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:26.360
<v Speaker 3>one of the individuals actually is</v>
<v Speaker 3>clinically is perfect and all of his</v>

835
00:35:26.361 --> 00:35:29.390
<v Speaker 3>legions went away and we only did one</v>
<v Speaker 3>treatment with these.</v>

836
00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:32.690
<v Speaker 3>Typically with Ms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's more refractory then rheumatory</v>

837
00:35:32.691 --> 00:35:34.550
<v Speaker 3>arthritis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rheumatoid arthritis.</v>

838
00:35:34.551 --> 00:35:39.260
<v Speaker 3>Usually after one treatment people get a</v>
<v Speaker 3>ton of benefit with Ms. They usually see</v>

839
00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:41.580
<v Speaker 3>after two or three treatments that they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they really,</v>

840
00:35:41.610 --> 00:35:44.490
<v Speaker 3>they see the most benefit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we only did one treatment in this,</v>

841
00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:46.110
<v Speaker 3>in this trial,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but one,</v>

842
00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:48.030
<v Speaker 3>one gentleman had three lesions in his</v>
<v Speaker 3>brain.</v>

843
00:35:48.031 --> 00:35:49.710
<v Speaker 3>All three legions completely</v>
<v Speaker 3>disappeared.</v>

844
00:35:49.711 --> 00:35:50.600
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

845
00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:54.900
<v Speaker 3>ms is a big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rheumatory arthritis is a big thing and</v>

846
00:35:54.901 --> 00:35:57.750
<v Speaker 3>I could tell you their stories in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not stories,</v>

847
00:35:57.751 --> 00:36:01.940
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people talking about their responses and</v>

848
00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:03.540
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's one lady that,</v>

849
00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:07.380
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>her husband was a physics phd physicist.</v>

850
00:36:07.381 --> 00:36:10.680
<v Speaker 3>He carried on working just so she could</v>
<v Speaker 3>afford,</v>

851
00:36:10.770 --> 00:36:13.680
<v Speaker 3>just so she could have insurance to</v>
<v Speaker 3>afford the medications,</v>

852
00:36:13.681 --> 00:36:16.800
<v Speaker 3>which are around a hundred grand a year</v>
<v Speaker 3>for her to get treated for rheumatoid</v>

853
00:36:16.801 --> 00:36:17.634
<v Speaker 3>arthritis.</v>

854
00:36:17.850 --> 00:36:19.890
<v Speaker 3>And she came down about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'll be,</v>

855
00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:22.770
<v Speaker 3>it's a little over three years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>November.</v>

856
00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:26.190
<v Speaker 3>And she hasn't been on any medications</v>
<v Speaker 3>since.</v>

857
00:36:26.191 --> 00:36:29.940
<v Speaker 3>She actually started walking around the</v>
<v Speaker 3>mall when she was in Panama.</v>

858
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.130
<v Speaker 3>And then when she got home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's completely pain free and she,</v>

859
00:36:33.131 --> 00:36:36.480
<v Speaker 3>she'd been pain free for three years and</v>
<v Speaker 3>her husband finally retired because he</v>

860
00:36:36.481 --> 00:36:37.770
<v Speaker 3>didn't care about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

861
00:36:37.771 --> 00:36:41.010
<v Speaker 3>having the insurance to pay for these</v>
<v Speaker 3>very expensive drugs that she was taken.</v>

862
00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:43.320
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ms Rheumatoid Arthritis,</v>

863
00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:44.940
<v Speaker 3>Lupus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

864
00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:46.980
<v Speaker 3>we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't have a lupus protocol.</v>

865
00:36:46.981 --> 00:36:47.790
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

866
00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:51.420
<v Speaker 3>a group in China that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's published six really good papers</v>

867
00:36:51.421 --> 00:36:55.170
<v Speaker 3>on Lupus and it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very effective in their trials.</v>

868
00:36:55.171 --> 00:36:57.150
<v Speaker 3>We haven't done that yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

869
00:36:57.550 --> 00:36:58.950
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then autism,</v>

870
00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:01.800
<v Speaker 3>it's not considered an autoimmune</v>
<v Speaker 3>disease,</v>

871
00:37:01.801 --> 00:37:02.970
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

872
00:37:03.010 --> 00:37:03.930
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have a trial.</v>

873
00:37:03.931 --> 00:37:08.040
<v Speaker 3>We just completed our autism trial with</v>
<v Speaker 3>33 33,</v>

874
00:37:08.070 --> 00:37:09.210
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>enrollees,</v>

875
00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:11.490
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with very good results.</v>

876
00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:12.330
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>

877
00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:15.210
<v Speaker 3>many of those kids became not autistic</v>
<v Speaker 3>after treatment.</v>

878
00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:17.820
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>confusing to me because you talked about</v>

879
00:37:17.821 --> 00:37:19.360
<v Speaker 3>people that are young,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

880
00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:21.350
<v Speaker 3>So why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why would it have such a benefit,</v>

881
00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:23.610
<v Speaker 3>benefit for them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

882
00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:26.790
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wrote an article in 2007 about why</v>

883
00:37:26.791 --> 00:37:28.820
<v Speaker 3>these cells should be good for autism</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

884
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:29.360
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

885
00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:31.920
<v Speaker 3>and basically it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

886
00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:34.080
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's the most downloaded article</v>

887
00:37:34.081 --> 00:37:37.680
<v Speaker 3>this journal's ever had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something like 75,000 people have</v>

888
00:37:37.681 --> 00:37:41.430
<v Speaker 3>downloaded a scientific journal article,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which really doesn't happen very often.</v>

889
00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:44.160
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but kids,</v>

890
00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:49.920
<v Speaker 3>people with autism have inflammatory</v>
<v Speaker 3>things going on in their body a lot of</v>

891
00:37:49.921 --> 00:37:51.540
<v Speaker 3>times in the gut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

892
00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:52.740
<v Speaker 3>there are in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>

893
00:37:52.890 --> 00:37:55.170
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the end of the small intestine,</v>

894
00:37:55.171 --> 00:37:59.490
<v Speaker 3>there are these inflammatory nodules</v>
<v Speaker 3>that look a lot like Crohn's disease and</v>

895
00:37:59.491 --> 00:38:01.920
<v Speaker 3>they secrete these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this inflammation,</v>

896
00:38:01.921 --> 00:38:04.440
<v Speaker 3>the thing goes to the brain and planes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the white matter of the brain,</v>

897
00:38:04.441 --> 00:38:07.710
<v Speaker 3>the white matter of brain swells,</v>
<v Speaker 3>decreases the blood flow to the brain.</v>

898
00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:09.660
<v Speaker 3>All of that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

899
00:38:09.661 --> 00:38:12.420
<v Speaker 3>intertwined.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then just a few years ago,</v>

900
00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:14.580
<v Speaker 3>there was this study that came out and</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what,</v>

901
00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:18.060
<v Speaker 3>this is what allowed us to go forward</v>
<v Speaker 3>with our clinical trial.</v>

902
00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:20.520
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they found that there the two</v>

903
00:38:20.521 --> 00:38:25.140
<v Speaker 3>inflammatory molecules that are MDC and</v>
<v Speaker 3>torque and they're perfectly correlate</v>

904
00:38:25.141 --> 00:38:30.141
<v Speaker 3>with the severity of symptoms of autism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we measured not only those two</v>

905
00:38:30.901 --> 00:38:34.080
<v Speaker 3>but another 30 some biomarkers we</v>
<v Speaker 3>measure.</v>

906
00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:39.100
<v Speaker 3>We did quantitative eeg is we did a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>of standardized scoring store a scoring</v>

907
00:38:39.790 --> 00:38:42.490
<v Speaker 3>with a neurologist that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that read them,</v>

908
00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:44.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>before treatment,</v>

909
00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:46.360
<v Speaker 3>during treatment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after treatment.</v>

910
00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:48.350
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I,</v>

911
00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:51.160
<v Speaker 3>I believe a lot of the problems with</v>
<v Speaker 3>autism,</v>

912
00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:56.220
<v Speaker 3>half stem from the inflammatory status</v>
<v Speaker 3>and these cells are definitely anti</v>

913
00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:57.940
<v Speaker 3>inflammatory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

914
00:38:57.941 --> 00:38:59.330
<v Speaker 3>They've had some benefit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

915
00:38:59.350 --> 00:39:04.350
<v Speaker 3>with changing the Diet and changing the</v>
<v Speaker 3>gut biome of kids with autism and</v>

916
00:39:04.391 --> 00:39:08.530
<v Speaker 3>they've made some benefits of that and</v>
<v Speaker 3>which they believe is also connected to</v>

917
00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:09.393
<v Speaker 3>inflammation.</v>

918
00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:10.451
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

919
00:39:10.451 --> 00:39:12.100
<v Speaker 3>If your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if your immune system's freaking out,</v>

920
00:39:12.101 --> 00:39:14.570
<v Speaker 3>every time you eat a piece of bread,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

921
00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:16.270
<v Speaker 3>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that immune system is thrown out</v>

922
00:39:16.271 --> 00:39:19.240
<v Speaker 3>molecules that are swollen your brain</v>
<v Speaker 3>and inflaming your brain,</v>

923
00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:20.950
<v Speaker 3>then it makes complete sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Yeah.</v>

924
00:39:21.410 --> 00:39:26.410
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think in general that the people with</v>

925
00:39:26.681 --> 00:39:29.980
<v Speaker 3>autism that do the best are the ones</v>
<v Speaker 3>that get that addressed before they come</v>

926
00:39:29.981 --> 00:39:31.360
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

927
00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:33.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some other doctors that do</v>

928
00:39:33.581 --> 00:39:35.560
<v Speaker 3>functional medicine and they look at</v>
<v Speaker 3>their diet,</v>

929
00:39:35.561 --> 00:39:37.240
<v Speaker 3>they look at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see if they have any heavy metals and</v>

930
00:39:37.241 --> 00:39:40.570
<v Speaker 3>that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the ones that just are slam dunk,</v>

931
00:39:40.571 --> 00:39:42.910
<v Speaker 3>do the best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been cleaned up before they come</v>

932
00:39:42.911 --> 00:39:44.070
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

933
00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:46.210
<v Speaker 3>so what about heart disease?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were saying you were talking about</v>

934
00:39:46.211 --> 00:39:48.640
<v Speaker 3>people that have heart issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

935
00:39:48.690 --> 00:39:50.530
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have a number of patients with heart</v>

936
00:39:50.531 --> 00:39:52.450
<v Speaker 3>failure that have responded quite well.</v>

937
00:39:52.450 --> 00:39:53.710
<v Speaker 3>Failure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>heart failure,</v>

938
00:39:54.010 --> 00:39:55.900
<v Speaker 3>heart attack,</v>
<v Speaker 3>need of a transplant,</v>

939
00:39:55.901 --> 00:39:56.920
<v Speaker 3>that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

940
00:39:57.130 --> 00:39:59.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>On transplant lists and that sort of</v>

941
00:39:59.201 --> 00:40:00.034
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

942
00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:02.590
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend who's on a transplant</v>
<v Speaker 3>list.</v>

943
00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:03.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

944
00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:04.820
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

945
00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:07.390
<v Speaker 3>there are different kinds of heart</v>
<v Speaker 3>failure and um,</v>

946
00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:08.890
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

947
00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:12.610
<v Speaker 3>the other thing interesting about heart</v>
<v Speaker 3>failure's a cells don't need to go to</v>

948
00:40:12.611 --> 00:40:16.870
<v Speaker 3>the heart and to actually become new</v>
<v Speaker 3>heart cells and that sort of thing.</v>

949
00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:19.330
<v Speaker 3>It's actually the secretions of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>cells.</v>

950
00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:20.740
<v Speaker 3>Like I said before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was,</v>

951
00:40:20.770 --> 00:40:22.900
<v Speaker 3>there was a study at University of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Buffalo where they took,</v>

952
00:40:23.350 --> 00:40:26.710
<v Speaker 3>they injected cells ivy in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a hamster model of heart failure.</v>

953
00:40:27.010 --> 00:40:28.750
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they looked in the,</v>

954
00:40:28.751 --> 00:40:30.430
<v Speaker 3>in the heart and there were very few</v>
<v Speaker 3>cells,</v>

955
00:40:30.431 --> 00:40:32.550
<v Speaker 3>but the heart failure got better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they said,</v>

956
00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:33.393
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's inject,</v>

957
00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:37.150
<v Speaker 3>let's inject those same cells.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are MSC umbilical mncs inject them</v>

958
00:40:37.151 --> 00:40:39.310
<v Speaker 3>into the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the hamstring muscle.</v>

959
00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:42.730
<v Speaker 3>And they demonstrated that none of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>cells came out of the hamstring muscle</v>

960
00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:47.350
<v Speaker 3>and yet the heart failure app better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then they took just the juice,</v>

961
00:40:47.530 --> 00:40:50.260
<v Speaker 3>the liquid that the cells secrete and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they start,</v>

962
00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:53.590
<v Speaker 3>stay simulated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The amount of juice that the cells would</v>

963
00:40:53.591 --> 00:40:56.230
<v Speaker 3>have produced in the body and just</v>
<v Speaker 3>injected the Jews and the heart failure</v>

964
00:40:56.231 --> 00:40:59.800
<v Speaker 3>at better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's really the secretions of the</v>

965
00:40:59.801 --> 00:41:03.760
<v Speaker 3>cells stimulating the natural repair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>augmenting the natural repair process of</v>

966
00:41:03.761 --> 00:41:06.940
<v Speaker 3>the body that has been stretched to its</v>
<v Speaker 3>limit.</v>

967
00:41:07.090 --> 00:41:08.800
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have a 65 year old,</v>

968
00:41:08.801 --> 00:41:10.870
<v Speaker 3>those cells aren't dividing very well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>

969
00:41:10.871 --> 00:41:14.860
<v Speaker 3>the Jews can help the cells divide</v>
<v Speaker 3>faster and produce more repair molecules</v>

970
00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:15.550
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

971
00:41:15.550 --> 00:41:17.740
<v Speaker 3>and make it better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So do you think that it could take</v>

972
00:41:17.741 --> 00:41:21.760
<v Speaker 3>someone who's on a heart transplant list</v>
<v Speaker 3>and literally fix their heart?</v>

973
00:41:22.270 --> 00:41:23.590
<v Speaker 3>I've seen it happen time and again.</v>

974
00:41:24.130 --> 00:41:25.090
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there,</v>

975
00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:25.691
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

976
00:41:25.691 --> 00:41:29.950
<v Speaker 3>there are clinical trials using similar</v>
<v Speaker 3>cell types that also have demonstrated</v>

977
00:41:29.951 --> 00:41:30.311
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

978
00:41:30.311 --> 00:41:32.020
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a molecule called BMP,</v>

979
00:41:32.021 --> 00:41:35.570
<v Speaker 3>which is high and heart failure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The BNP came down in every single case,</v>

980
00:41:35.830 --> 00:41:37.460
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the injection ejection fraction,</v>

981
00:41:37.461 --> 00:41:39.380
<v Speaker 3>which measures kind of like the</v>
<v Speaker 3>efficiency,</v>

982
00:41:39.381 --> 00:41:41.840
<v Speaker 3>how much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much blood you're heart's pumping on</v>

983
00:41:41.841 --> 00:41:43.070
<v Speaker 3>each stroke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

984
00:41:43.071 --> 00:41:44.600
<v Speaker 3>went up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And every single patient,</v>

985
00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:47.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think are in the book.</v>

986
00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:49.130
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the craziest case was a,</v>

987
00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:51.370
<v Speaker 3>was a Gringo who was down in Costa Rica</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

988
00:41:51.371 --> 00:41:52.430
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he,</v>

989
00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:54.500
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was our,</v>

990
00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:55.820
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was probably 20,</v>

991
00:41:55.821 --> 00:41:59.600
<v Speaker 3>25% routinely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he got a viral disease or something</v>

992
00:41:59.601 --> 00:42:02.840
<v Speaker 3>else and he was 11% ejection fraction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>normals about 60.</v>

993
00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:04.530
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

994
00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:05.630
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the regular,</v>

995
00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:09.530
<v Speaker 3>the regular hospital who worked a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>with us using with our spinal cord</v>

996
00:42:09.531 --> 00:42:12.590
<v Speaker 3>patients and seeing results,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seeing people walking again,</v>

997
00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:14.600
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

998
00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:17.900
<v Speaker 3>they just said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't get on a plane.</v>

999
00:42:17.930 --> 00:42:20.510
<v Speaker 3>You're at 3,700 feet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you get on a plane,</v>

1000
00:42:20.511 --> 00:42:22.970
<v Speaker 3>you'll be dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might as well go see these guys over</v>

1001
00:42:22.971 --> 00:42:25.130
<v Speaker 3>at stem cell place and see if anything</v>
<v Speaker 3>had happened.</v>

1002
00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:26.930
<v Speaker 3>And I think his case is in the book as</v>
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

1003
00:42:26.931 --> 00:42:28.090
<v Speaker 3>But he went from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>

1004
00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:31.610
<v Speaker 3>11 to 42 or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1005
00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:34.970
<v Speaker 3>that he wasn't the first case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first case was a doctor who's a</v>

1006
00:42:34.971 --> 00:42:37.970
<v Speaker 3>friend of George's friend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doctor pause or medical director,</v>

1007
00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:40.610
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who had congenital.</v>

1008
00:42:40.850 --> 00:42:43.340
<v Speaker 3>So his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his mother had died of heart failure.</v>

1009
00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:48.290
<v Speaker 3>His sister had died,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his brother had died and he was,</v>

1010
00:42:48.291 --> 00:42:50.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not even 50 years old and his ejection</v>

1011
00:42:50.871 --> 00:42:55.871
<v Speaker 3>fraction was hovering around 30%.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of people at,</v>

1012
00:42:57.110 --> 00:42:58.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at an advanced age,</v>

1013
00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:00.500
<v Speaker 3>you're not even going to get on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>list.</v>

1014
00:43:00.501 --> 00:43:01.490
<v Speaker 3>Cause if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're a,</v>

1015
00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:04.580
<v Speaker 3>if you're a 50 or 60 year old and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a 20 year old ahead of Ya,</v>

1016
00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:05.900
<v Speaker 3>20 year old's going to win.</v>

1017
00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:08.540
<v Speaker 3>And so he begged and begged to come</v>
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

1018
00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:11.090
<v Speaker 3>He was our first patient and we didn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>even really want to take him because we</v>

1019
00:43:11.091 --> 00:43:13.220
<v Speaker 3>didn't know what was gonna happen cause</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody had ever done it.</v>

1020
00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:16.030
<v Speaker 3>And we treated him and he went back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1021
00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:19.050
<v Speaker 3>and he had his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had an ejection fraction,</v>

1022
00:43:19.051 --> 00:43:23.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the echocardiogram and it was 52% and</v>

1023
00:43:23.061 --> 00:43:25.030
<v Speaker 3>then the doctor didn't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he did read it.</v>

1024
00:43:25.031 --> 00:43:27.950
<v Speaker 3>It a month later it was 55%.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1025
00:43:28.070 --> 00:43:28.970
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1026
00:43:28.990 --> 00:43:29.823
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>

1027
00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:34.370
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's for every case and we</v>
<v Speaker 3>have people with like a super bad heart</v>

1028
00:43:34.371 --> 00:43:37.340
<v Speaker 3>attack and there's not enough to repair</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you really need a heart transplant.</v>

1029
00:43:37.341 --> 00:43:40.070
<v Speaker 3>But I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you're going to see that it's</v>

1030
00:43:40.130 --> 00:43:44.330
<v Speaker 3>ultimately I think in 20 years are</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably going to see standard of care</v>

1031
00:43:44.810 --> 00:43:49.070
<v Speaker 3>for diseases,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chronic diseases like any chronic</v>

1032
00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:52.460
<v Speaker 3>degenerative disease for which there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>no good treatment.</v>

1033
00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:55.430
<v Speaker 3>You're going to see standard of care is</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be young,</v>

1034
00:43:55.431 --> 00:43:59.650
<v Speaker 3>healthy mesenchymal stem cells.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because if you look at the root cause</v>

1035
00:43:59.651 --> 00:44:02.390
<v Speaker 3>here I get a question a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How was it?</v>

1036
00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:04.400
<v Speaker 3>How is it these things worked for so</v>
<v Speaker 3>many things.</v>

1037
00:44:04.430 --> 00:44:08.480
<v Speaker 3>Well when the root cause is a lack of or</v>
<v Speaker 3>dysfunction of those cells,</v>

1038
00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:13.250
<v Speaker 3>then it makes sense that replenishing</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are re restoring them with young</v>

1039
00:44:13.251 --> 00:44:15.800
<v Speaker 3>healthy wounds could be a useful</v>
<v Speaker 3>treatment.</v>

1040
00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:17.630
<v Speaker 3>Well Mel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is so important to you that you</v>

1041
00:44:17.631 --> 00:44:20.210
<v Speaker 3>wanted to come on and talk about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wanted to let people know about this</v>

1042
00:44:20.211 --> 00:44:20.990
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1043
00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:22.130
<v Speaker 3>I think it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1044
00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:24.140
<v Speaker 3>and it seems a crime to me that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1045
00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:27.470
<v Speaker 3>it isn't easier to do in this country</v>
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>

1046
00:44:27.550 --> 00:44:28.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

1047
00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:29.480
<v Speaker 3>we're an advanced country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1048
00:44:29.481 --> 00:44:31.980
<v Speaker 3>they should look a little harder at it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's a</v>

1049
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:34.140
<v Speaker 2>mystery to me why it isn't the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1050
00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:35.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1051
00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:37.500
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there are places where one can go and</v>

1052
00:44:37.501 --> 00:44:39.150
<v Speaker 2>get some help,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's good.</v>

1053
00:44:39.210 --> 00:44:41.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know another Gal,</v>

1054
00:44:41.011 --> 00:44:44.280
<v Speaker 2>she's a good friend of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she tour a shoulders up because she was</v>

1055
00:44:44.281 --> 00:44:46.630
<v Speaker 2>like an athlete and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1056
00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:50.040
<v Speaker 2>she had her shoulders down and she got</v>
<v Speaker 2>some dropped into her and it actually,</v>

1057
00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:54.090
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>helped greatly with an autoimmune</v>

1058
00:44:54.690 --> 00:44:57.390
<v Speaker 2>disorder that she had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then she was able to have kids.</v>

1059
00:44:58.590 --> 00:45:00.540
<v Speaker 2>It was that kind of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1060
00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:01.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There,</v>

1061
00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:04.060
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some really good animal data</v>

1062
00:45:04.061 --> 00:45:08.800
<v Speaker 3>showing that you can inject these cells</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can take ovarian failure and</v>

1063
00:45:08.801 --> 00:45:10.690
<v Speaker 3>reverse it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in her case,</v>

1064
00:45:10.750 --> 00:45:11.583
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1065
00:45:12.310 --> 00:45:16.420
<v Speaker 3>she had an autoimmune disease and she</v>
<v Speaker 3>was unable to have children told that</v>

1066
00:45:16.421 --> 00:45:17.320
<v Speaker 3>from the very young age.</v>

1067
00:45:17.410 --> 00:45:18.243
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1068
00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:21.610
<v Speaker 2>after treatment she got pregnant pretty</v>
<v Speaker 2>quickly.</v>

1069
00:45:21.790 --> 00:45:24.850
<v Speaker 2>This sounds almost too good to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is almost like be skeptical.</v>

1070
00:45:24.851 --> 00:45:26.070
<v Speaker 2>People that are listening to this right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

1071
00:45:26.071 --> 00:45:28.360
<v Speaker 2>I'll probably be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why this fucking shit cures everything.</v>

1072
00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:31.150
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like the old spruik around the</v>
<v Speaker 2>corner.</v>

1073
00:45:31.630 --> 00:45:33.990
<v Speaker 2>Good for moles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>holes and pimples on ones.</v>

1074
00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:37.900
<v Speaker 2>But you've got studies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You mean you've got real trials to back</v>

1075
00:45:37.901 --> 00:45:41.200
<v Speaker 2>this up and you've got a host of</v>
<v Speaker 2>patients that are healed up and,</v>

1076
00:45:41.201 --> 00:45:42.220
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and healthy.</v>

1077
00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:43.480
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1078
00:45:43.690 --> 00:45:44.910
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>totally sound.</v>

1079
00:45:44.950 --> 00:45:47.090
<v Speaker 2>Take nothing wrong with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to go down there and shut up.</v>

1080
00:45:48.070 --> 00:45:52.270
<v Speaker 2>You see a 92 year old man who is about</v>
<v Speaker 2>ready to kick the bucket and he's almost</v>

1081
00:45:52.271 --> 00:45:55.090
<v Speaker 2>a hundred.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's going to celebrate 100 years in</v>

1082
00:45:55.091 --> 00:45:55.930
<v Speaker 2>August.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1083
00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:57.220
<v Speaker 2>and it's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

1084
00:45:57.221 --> 00:45:59.110
<v Speaker 2>he's better off than he was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me tell you.</v>

1085
00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:01.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This young guy with,</v>

1086
00:46:01.461 --> 00:46:02.550
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the shins,</v>

1087
00:46:02.551 --> 00:46:03.770
<v Speaker 3>muscular dystrophy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know this,</v>

1088
00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:06.510
<v Speaker 3>the cells don't last forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is also an important point.</v>

1089
00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:07.800
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the shins,</v>

1090
00:46:07.801 --> 00:46:08.700
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

1091
00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:12.000
<v Speaker 3>it's a genetic defect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they're missing a protein and these</v>

1092
00:46:12.001 --> 00:46:14.100
<v Speaker 3>cells go in this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in animal models,</v>

1093
00:46:14.101 --> 00:46:16.170
<v Speaker 3>he sells,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you give them to the animal.</v>

1094
00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:20.430
<v Speaker 3>They go into the muscle and then they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they start secreting that molecule that</v>

1095
00:46:20.431 --> 00:46:22.550
<v Speaker 3>they're missing but they only last for</v>
<v Speaker 3>about four or five,</v>

1096
00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:24.210
<v Speaker 3>six months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they,</v>

1097
00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:26.790
<v Speaker 3>then they start maturing and then the</v>
<v Speaker 3>immune system clears them.</v>

1098
00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:30.030
<v Speaker 3>It's a real important point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have that with embryonic stem</v>

1099
00:46:30.031 --> 00:46:32.730
<v Speaker 3>cells because they cause tumors and</v>
<v Speaker 3>things like that.</v>

1100
00:46:32.731 --> 00:46:36.330
<v Speaker 3>And the great thing about these cells,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't cause tumors because they</v>

1101
00:46:36.331 --> 00:46:38.610
<v Speaker 3>differentiate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to be a baby.</v>

1102
00:46:38.810 --> 00:46:42.360
<v Speaker 3>They are just there to do their job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is to keep homeostasis,</v>

1103
00:46:42.361 --> 00:46:44.910
<v Speaker 3>keep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>keep the immune system controlled.</v>

1104
00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:47.220
<v Speaker 3>Can you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>help with regeneration,</v>

1105
00:46:47.250 --> 00:46:48.083
<v Speaker 3>all that sort of thing.</v>

1106
00:46:48.730 --> 00:46:51.180
<v Speaker 2>But the embryonic stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause I find this interesting,</v>

1107
00:46:51.181 --> 00:46:53.880
<v Speaker 2>the embryonic step is full of weird</v>
<v Speaker 2>anomalies and stuff.</v>

1108
00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:55.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We wrote,</v>

1109
00:46:56.450 --> 00:47:00.260
<v Speaker 3>a few of us got together and wrote an</v>
<v Speaker 3>article when they finally put the clamp</v>

1110
00:47:00.261 --> 00:47:03.800
<v Speaker 3>on the last embryonic stem cell</v>
<v Speaker 3>treatment and we'd been saying for years</v>

1111
00:47:03.801 --> 00:47:06.800
<v Speaker 3>that embryonic stem cells aren't going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to work because they want to become</v>

1112
00:47:06.801 --> 00:47:08.570
<v Speaker 3>babies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their number one problem is they want to</v>

1113
00:47:08.571 --> 00:47:11.720
<v Speaker 3>become babies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to these cells,</v>

1114
00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:14.150
<v Speaker 3>the cells that we start with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't want to become babies.</v>

1115
00:47:14.151 --> 00:47:15.260
<v Speaker 3>The babies are already born.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are,</v>

1116
00:47:15.261 --> 00:47:17.320
<v Speaker 3>they're mature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're Mesenchymal,</v>

1117
00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:19.300
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's what they are and that</v>

1118
00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:21.650
<v Speaker 3>they're never going to be anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1119
00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:23.690
<v Speaker 3>whereas the embryonic stem cells,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1120
00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:25.970
<v Speaker 3>the biggest problem with them is they</v>
<v Speaker 3>always form tumors.</v>

1121
00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.730
<v Speaker 3>They form teratomas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so in order for them to be</v>

1122
00:47:28.750 --> 00:47:30.820
<v Speaker 3>functional,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to grow them out.</v>

1123
00:47:30.821 --> 00:47:33.460
<v Speaker 3>And if you want them to have MSC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like qualities,</v>

1124
00:47:33.461 --> 00:47:35.530
<v Speaker 3>you have to force them to become mscs.</v>

1125
00:47:35.950 --> 00:47:39.670
<v Speaker 3>And then you have to make darn sure that</v>
<v Speaker 3>there aren't any,</v>

1126
00:47:39.850 --> 00:47:42.340
<v Speaker 3>if I only takes one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there's one left,</v>

1127
00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:46.840
<v Speaker 3>then it's going to form a tumor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that was the big problem that the</v>

1128
00:47:46.841 --> 00:47:47.950
<v Speaker 3>expense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was three,</v>

1129
00:47:47.951 --> 00:47:51.190
<v Speaker 3>$400,000 a dose just to make sure that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't have one in them.</v>

1130
00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:54.880
<v Speaker 3>And then they weren't as beneficial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they'd been monkeyed with in the lab</v>

1131
00:47:54.910 --> 00:47:59.080
<v Speaker 3>from when they were embryonic and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>converted and converted and converted</v>

1132
00:47:59.081 --> 00:48:01.720
<v Speaker 3>and converted and then grown up in huge</v>
<v Speaker 3>numbers.</v>

1133
00:48:01.870 --> 00:48:04.810
<v Speaker 3>And so they were monkeyed with these</v>
<v Speaker 3>cells.</v>

1134
00:48:04.811 --> 00:48:06.760
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to monkey with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they just do it naturally.</v>

1135
00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:09.670
<v Speaker 3>You just take them out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you digest them,</v>

1136
00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:11.770
<v Speaker 3>you put,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you put them in a nutrient broth and the</v>

1137
00:48:11.771 --> 00:48:15.250
<v Speaker 3>right temperature and humidity and</v>
<v Speaker 3>oxygen levels,</v>

1138
00:48:15.251 --> 00:48:16.990
<v Speaker 3>and they just grow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1139
00:48:17.290 --> 00:48:19.060
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1140
00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:20.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1141
00:48:20.010 --> 00:48:22.060
<v Speaker 3>we wrote an article about embryonic stem</v>
<v Speaker 3>cells.</v>

1142
00:48:22.090 --> 00:48:26.140
<v Speaker 3>We call it the king is the king is dead</v>
<v Speaker 3>long live the king because,</v>

1143
00:48:26.290 --> 00:48:26.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1144
00:48:26.830 --> 00:48:31.830
<v Speaker 3>the California,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the California voters kneejerk $3</v>

1145
00:48:31.930 --> 00:48:34.060
<v Speaker 3>billion towards an embryonic stem cell</v>
<v Speaker 3>work,</v>

1146
00:48:34.420 --> 00:48:35.201
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1147
00:48:35.201 --> 00:48:39.730
<v Speaker 3>against the Bush administration's</v>
<v Speaker 3>restriction of spending money on</v>

1148
00:48:39.731 --> 00:48:42.670
<v Speaker 3>embryonic stem cell research,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't banned,</v>

1149
00:48:42.671 --> 00:48:45.010
<v Speaker 3>as most people said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All they said was,</v>

1150
00:48:45.011 --> 00:48:49.180
<v Speaker 3>we're not going to use taxpayer money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>federal taxpayer money to go towards</v>

1151
00:48:49.181 --> 00:48:51.610
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what people heard was they don't</v>

1152
00:48:51.611 --> 00:48:53.080
<v Speaker 3>want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't want progress.</v>

1153
00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:55.040
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's happened is they,</v>

1154
00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:57.490
<v Speaker 3>at last count,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they spent,</v>

1155
00:48:57.760 --> 00:48:58.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>

1156
00:48:58.781 --> 00:49:02.230
<v Speaker 3>two and three quarter billion dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've got $250 million left.</v>

1157
00:49:02.620 --> 00:49:05.560
<v Speaker 3>And guess what they're studying now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>adult stem cells,</v>

1158
00:49:05.770 --> 00:49:07.780
<v Speaker 3>they're studying umbilical cord stem</v>
<v Speaker 3>cells.</v>

1159
00:49:07.790 --> 00:49:12.160
<v Speaker 3>They're studying Mesenchymal stem cells,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've completely cut out everything on</v>

1160
00:49:12.161 --> 00:49:14.920
<v Speaker 3>the embryonic side because it just took</v>
<v Speaker 3>that long.</v>

1161
00:49:14.921 --> 00:49:17.740
<v Speaker 3>There was so much misinformation out</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1162

<v Speaker 3>if there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's something that can be addressed</v>

1176
00:49:57.371 --> 00:50:00.130
<v Speaker 3>with bone marrow in the u s RMI</v>
<v Speaker 3>clinic.com.</v>

1177
00:50:00.131 --> 00:50:00.980

<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1178
00:50:01.270 --> 00:50:03.730
<v Speaker 3>the bone marrow's just not as effective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1179
00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:05.140
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can be.</v>

1180

<v Speaker 3>It,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1181
00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:09.430
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to say because everybody's</v>
<v Speaker 3>bone marrow is different.</v>

1182
00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:10.810
<v Speaker 3>Your age is different.</v>

1184
00:50:14.651 --> 00:50:18.490
<v Speaker 3>smoker or you're diabetic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's worth typically using</v>

1185
00:50:18.491 --> 00:50:20.560
<v Speaker 3>your bone marrow because it's just not</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to do a lot.</v>

1186
00:50:20.950 --> 00:50:21.940
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1236
00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:10.060
<v Speaker 1>The lightening bolts coming off my</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1238
00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:14.950
<v Speaker 3>Well he's definitely dramatic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't say that to his face</v>

1239
00:52:16.940 --> 00:52:20.770
<v Speaker 3>with a smile only.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

1240
00:52:20.771 --> 00:52:22.570
<v Speaker 3>he's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you treated him,</v>

1241
00:52:22.571 --> 00:52:25.000
<v Speaker 3>he was going through some pretty</v>
<v Speaker 3>significant issues with his neck.</v>

1242
00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:26.230
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

1243
00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:28.870
<v Speaker 3>What benefits did he find off of that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1244
00:52:28.871 --> 00:52:30.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think for his neck,</v>

1245
00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:33.820
<v Speaker 3>it structurally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we weren't able to get the cells there.</v>

1246
00:52:33.821 --> 00:52:35.380
<v Speaker 3>And I don't know if there's enough</v>
<v Speaker 3>laughed,</v>

1247
00:52:35.381 --> 00:52:37.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a lot of people.</v>

1248
00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:39.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1249
00:52:39.401 --> 00:52:41.650
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing,</v>

1250
00:52:41.651 --> 00:52:44.920
<v Speaker 3>if there's nothing structurally to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1251
00:52:44.921 --> 00:52:46.660
<v Speaker 3>to do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But a lot of people talk about,</v>

1252
00:52:46.690 --> 00:52:48.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hair loss and these cells,</v>

1253
00:52:48.071 --> 00:52:50.650
<v Speaker 3>burke for hair loss and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they do pretty good job,</v>

1254
00:52:50.651 --> 00:52:53.500
<v Speaker 3>but you can't grow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't grow grass on concrete,</v>

1255
00:52:53.501 --> 00:52:54.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can't,</v>

1256
00:52:54.850 --> 00:52:56.840
<v Speaker 3>you can't stimulate a nerve to regrow</v>
<v Speaker 3>that tea.</v>

1257
00:52:56.860 --> 00:52:58.400
<v Speaker 3>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not even a thread left.</v>

1258
00:52:58.401 --> 00:52:59.650
<v Speaker 3>So he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he didn't get,</v>

1259
00:53:00.120 --> 00:53:03.640
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe you got any benefit from</v>
<v Speaker 3>his as accident problem,</v>

1260
00:53:04.030 --> 00:53:05.260
<v Speaker 3>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1261
00:53:05.380 --> 00:53:07.960
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the metabolic benefits were fantastic</v>

1262
00:53:07.961 --> 00:53:10.630
<v Speaker 3>for him and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and energy wise and things like that.</v>

1263
00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:12.073
<v Speaker 1>His,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of,</v>

1264
00:53:12.110 --> 00:53:16.370
<v Speaker 1>one of his issues is that he has some</v>
<v Speaker 1>atrophy on one of his arms because his</v>

1265
00:53:16.580 --> 00:53:20.180
<v Speaker 1>nerves in his neck were being pinched</v>
<v Speaker 1>and for a long time and he didn't</v>

1266
00:53:20.181 --> 00:53:22.070
<v Speaker 1>address it quick enough and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1267
00:53:22.071 --> 00:53:23.600
<v Speaker 1>it got to the point where his arm is</v>
<v Speaker 1>shrinking.</v>

1268
00:53:23.940 --> 00:53:25.770
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the reasons why I went</v>

1269
00:53:25.771 --> 00:53:26.040
<v Speaker 1>down there.</v>

1270
00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:28.740
<v Speaker 3>Did he experience any benefit from that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe he did.</v>

1271
00:53:28.770 --> 00:53:29.603
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1272
00:53:29.730 --> 00:53:30.660
<v Speaker 3>That's a tough one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1273
00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:33.510
<v Speaker 3>Regeneration of nerves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially really long time.</v>

1274
00:53:33.540 --> 00:53:34.081
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1275
00:53:34.081 --> 00:53:36.120
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for like for spinal cord injury,</v>

1276
00:53:36.570 --> 00:53:37.560
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we did,</v>

1277
00:53:37.561 --> 00:53:39.720
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we did a cohort analysis and,</v>

1278
00:53:39.810 --> 00:53:43.020
<v Speaker 3>and basically if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they're within one year of injury,</v>

1279
00:53:43.030 --> 00:53:48.030
<v Speaker 3>100% of 100% of the patients ree ree had</v>
<v Speaker 3>restoration of some neurologic function.</v>

1280
00:53:49.860 --> 00:53:53.670
<v Speaker 3>It was between one and two years is 82%.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was after two years.</v>

1281
00:53:53.671 --> 00:53:58.620
<v Speaker 3>It was 50% so the longer it is and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and also the older you are,</v>

1282
00:53:58.621 --> 00:54:02.250
<v Speaker 3>the less you have less.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know the reason these cells work for</v>

1283
00:54:02.251 --> 00:54:04.230
<v Speaker 3>spinal cord injuries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't become spa,</v>

1284
00:54:04.290 --> 00:54:06.510
<v Speaker 3>they don't become nerves or anything</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

1285
00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:09.330
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the spinal cord is one of the most</v>

1286
00:54:09.331 --> 00:54:10.780
<v Speaker 3>replete,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1287
00:54:11.340 --> 00:54:13.650
<v Speaker 3>areas of the body when it comes to blood</v>
<v Speaker 3>vessels.</v>

1288
00:54:13.650 --> 00:54:15.660
<v Speaker 3>They're very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just barely enough blood vessels</v>

1289
00:54:15.661 --> 00:54:18.720
<v Speaker 3>to keep it alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And your liver on the other hand has</v>

1290
00:54:18.721 --> 00:54:20.700
<v Speaker 3>just tons of blood vessels in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And your liver,</v>

1291
00:54:20.940 --> 00:54:24.780
<v Speaker 3>you can cut 80% of your liver out and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>will regrow itself with your spinal</v>

1292
00:54:24.781 --> 00:54:26.400
<v Speaker 3>cord.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just kind of digging a little bit</v>

1293
00:54:26.401 --> 00:54:28.740
<v Speaker 3>and it won't repair itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's because there are no blood</v>

1294
00:54:28.741 --> 00:54:32.520
<v Speaker 3>vessels and therefore there are no msc</v>
<v Speaker 3>or very few mscs.</v>

1295
00:54:32.780 --> 00:54:36.660
<v Speaker 3>So like one 50th the number of mscs</v>
<v Speaker 3>reside in your spinal cord because we</v>

1296
00:54:36.661 --> 00:54:39.060
<v Speaker 3>built this wonderful cage around it to</v>
<v Speaker 3>protect it.</v>

1297
00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:43.230
<v Speaker 3>And so all we're doing is we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we shoot the cells in there,</v>

1298
00:54:43.231 --> 00:54:46.890
<v Speaker 3>we also give them a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>My v and the cells secrete the things</v>

1299
00:54:46.891 --> 00:54:49.500
<v Speaker 3>that are necessary for this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the spinal cord to regenerate</v>

1300
00:54:49.501 --> 00:54:51.900
<v Speaker 3>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the longer it is from inner jury,</v>

1301
00:54:51.901 --> 00:54:54.630
<v Speaker 3>the more scarring there is and all that</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of thing.</v>

1302
00:54:55.020 --> 00:54:56.850
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the less benefit you're going to see.</v>

1303
00:54:57.390 --> 00:55:02.070
<v Speaker 3>So do you anticipate a time where</v>
<v Speaker 3>there'll be able to regenerate spinal</v>

1304
00:55:02.071 --> 00:55:06.480
<v Speaker 3>tissue or someone has got a spinal cord</v>
<v Speaker 3>injury where they have partial or some</v>

1305
00:55:06.481 --> 00:55:09.030
<v Speaker 3>sort of paralysis and they can be able</v>
<v Speaker 3>to regenerate?</v>

1306
00:55:09.031 --> 00:55:10.590
<v Speaker 3>That?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do and I,</v>

1307
00:55:10.591 --> 00:55:12.900
<v Speaker 3>and we have many cases that it's already</v>
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>

1308
00:55:12.901 --> 00:55:13.810
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1309
00:55:13.860 --> 00:55:15.480
<v Speaker 3>Like what cases?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1310
00:55:15.540 --> 00:55:19.320
<v Speaker 3>you know Juan Carlos Maria is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>commercial pilot from,</v>

1311
00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:22.150
<v Speaker 3>from Costa Rica and he was one day</v>
<v Speaker 3>flying is a,</v>

1312
00:55:22.740 --> 00:55:26.460
<v Speaker 3>a national geographic photographer</v>
<v Speaker 3>around and then his private plane and</v>

1313
00:55:26.461 --> 00:55:30.540
<v Speaker 3>they pancake and both of them got spinal</v>
<v Speaker 3>cord injuries and JC say pancakes.</v>

1314
00:55:30.541 --> 00:55:32.430
<v Speaker 3>You mean crashed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>crashed the plane yet?</v>

1315
00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:34.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were up on a volcano and it's like</v>

1316
00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:38.070
<v Speaker 3>some crazy winds and stuff and it just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just dropped out of the sky and</v>

1317
00:55:38.071 --> 00:55:40.050
<v Speaker 3>landed on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1318
00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:41.730
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he had,</v>

1319
00:55:41.970 --> 00:55:43.920
<v Speaker 3>he had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1320
00:55:44.070 --> 00:55:46.500
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no function and no,</v>

1321
00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:48.360
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no sensation below the injury,</v>

1322
00:55:48.361 --> 00:55:51.510
<v Speaker 3>basically from his belly button down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had no erectile function,</v>

1323
00:55:51.511 --> 00:55:53.520
<v Speaker 3>no bowel function by function,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any of that stuff.</v>

1324
00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:56.070
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first time we treated him,</v>

1325
00:55:56.470 --> 00:55:57.870
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and how are you treating them?</v>

1326
00:55:58.440 --> 00:56:01.050
<v Speaker 3>We're giving them ib cells and</v>
<v Speaker 3>interfaith intrathecal,</v>

1327
00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:04.020
<v Speaker 3>so into the spinal fluid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the first,</v>

1328
00:56:04.021 --> 00:56:06.420
<v Speaker 3>the first round of treatments,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1329
00:56:06.450 --> 00:56:07.560
<v Speaker 3>after that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>

1330
00:56:07.561 --> 00:56:09.120
<v Speaker 3>his biggest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>

1331
00:56:09.630 --> 00:56:12.660
<v Speaker 3>he had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he described it as like a 10 out of a 10</v>

1332
00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:15.570
<v Speaker 3>pain scale.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we had this neuropathic pain that was</v>

1333
00:56:15.571 --> 00:56:18.180
<v Speaker 3>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was shoveling down narcotics like</v>

1334
00:56:18.181 --> 00:56:19.980
<v Speaker 3>nobody's business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And He,</v>

1335
00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:22.980
<v Speaker 3>after the first treatment he didn't get</v>
<v Speaker 3>any restoration of function or,</v>

1336
00:56:23.230 --> 00:56:26.110
<v Speaker 3>but his pain dropped from a 10 to a</v>
<v Speaker 3>three.</v>

1337
00:56:26.350 --> 00:56:30.460
<v Speaker 3>And so he got off the narcotics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then the second time we treated him,</v>

1338
00:56:30.670 --> 00:56:33.520
<v Speaker 3>he got his left leg back and he could</v>
<v Speaker 3>move it.</v>

1339
00:56:33.550 --> 00:56:35.800
<v Speaker 3>And how long after the treatment?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1340
00:56:36.130 --> 00:56:37.960
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We started treating him six months and</v>

1341
00:56:37.961 --> 00:56:40.060
<v Speaker 3>three days after his accident.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

1342
00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:42.930
<v Speaker 3>so he got the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first round of treatments was in,</v>

1343
00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:45.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first month and it was about three</v>

1344
00:56:45.011 --> 00:56:45.490
<v Speaker 3>months later.</v>

1345
00:56:45.490 --> 00:56:47.860
<v Speaker 3>We did the second round,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but three months later he got his right</v>

1346
00:56:47.861 --> 00:56:52.180
<v Speaker 3>leg back and then three months later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was over about a year at 15 month</v>

1347
00:56:52.181 --> 00:56:55.270
<v Speaker 3>period probably in total.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He basically got everything back.</v>

1348
00:56:55.271 --> 00:56:56.920
<v Speaker 3>He got erectile function,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he got bowel,</v>

1349
00:56:56.921 --> 00:56:58.270
<v Speaker 3>bladder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that sort of thing.</v>

1350
00:56:58.570 --> 00:56:59.660
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

1351
00:56:59.810 --> 00:57:02.860
<v Speaker 3>I just had dinner with him the other</v>
<v Speaker 3>night and Costa Rica and he can walk in</v>

1352
00:57:02.861 --> 00:57:05.950
<v Speaker 3>here and he got his commercial pilot's</v>
<v Speaker 3>license back and you know,</v>

1353
00:57:05.951 --> 00:57:08.200
<v Speaker 3>he started a new business and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has,</v>

1354
00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:10.420
<v Speaker 3>he's 100%,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

1355
00:57:10.750 --> 00:57:14.380
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't say 100% because he does have</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bit of a limp,</v>

1356
00:57:14.381 --> 00:57:16.570
<v Speaker 3>but he broke his leg when he was four</v>
<v Speaker 3>wheeling.</v>

1357
00:57:16.930 --> 00:57:20.700
<v Speaker 3>So a maniac.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1358
00:57:20.710 --> 00:57:24.940
<v Speaker 3>he can't get enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is this before or after the</v>

1359
00:57:24.941 --> 00:57:25.870
<v Speaker 3>accident?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They broken.</v>

1360
00:57:26.650 --> 00:57:28.180
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah.</v>

1361
00:57:28.181 --> 00:57:31.030
<v Speaker 3>So he got all better and he was</v>
<v Speaker 3>perfectly fine.</v>

1362
00:57:31.180 --> 00:57:34.390
<v Speaker 3>And then he goes out and four wheeling</v>
<v Speaker 3>and breaks his leg.</v>

1363
00:57:34.390 --> 00:57:37.840
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he was 100% then he fucked himself up</v>

1364
00:57:37.841 --> 00:57:39.940
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he lifts a little bit.</v>

1365
00:57:39.941 --> 00:57:41.740
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but most people don't know that he ever</v>

1366
00:57:41.741 --> 00:57:43.660
<v Speaker 3>had a spinal cord injury,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1367
00:57:43.750 --> 00:57:46.240
<v Speaker 3>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you feel like with conventional</v>

1368
00:57:46.241 --> 00:57:47.800
<v Speaker 3>treatment that guy would still be in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>wheelchair?</v>

1369
00:57:48.420 --> 00:57:49.253
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

1370
00:57:49.410 --> 00:57:50.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he was the,</v>

1371
00:57:50.411 --> 00:57:54.430
<v Speaker 3>he made zero progress so that when we</v>
<v Speaker 3>were designing this study that we're</v>

1372
00:57:54.431 --> 00:57:57.610
<v Speaker 3>doing at Miami that's being funded by</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Marcus people,</v>

1373
00:57:57.930 --> 00:58:00.580
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are two newer neurosurgeons that</v>

1374
00:58:00.581 --> 00:58:02.350
<v Speaker 3>are on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we wanted to,</v>

1375
00:58:02.530 --> 00:58:06.280
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're discussing what at what,</v>

1376
00:58:06.580 --> 00:58:07.560
<v Speaker 3>at what time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>point you,</v>

1377
00:58:07.561 --> 00:58:11.320
<v Speaker 3>we accept him and these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these very prominent neurosurgeon said,</v>

1378
00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:15.490
<v Speaker 3>let's do six months because at six</v>
<v Speaker 3>months you got 98 to 99% back.</v>

1379
00:58:15.510 --> 00:58:18.880
<v Speaker 3>Everything you're going to have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's do patients or subjects that</v>

1380
00:58:18.881 --> 00:58:20.350
<v Speaker 3>are from six months to two years.</v>

1381
00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:22.420
<v Speaker 3>And so that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are the inclusion criteria.</v>

1382
00:58:22.421 --> 00:58:24.730
<v Speaker 3>That's a timing that we're going to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the study.</v>

1383
00:58:25.150 --> 00:58:26.860
<v Speaker 3>At Miami.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is phenomenal.</v>

1384
00:58:26.861 --> 00:58:29.530
<v Speaker 3>So is that study published online?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there anything where,</v>

1385
00:58:29.531 --> 00:58:32.200
<v Speaker 3>or this case rather publish on cases,</v>
<v Speaker 3>posts online?</v>

1386
00:58:32.201 --> 00:58:32.741
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

1387
00:58:32.741 --> 00:58:34.830
<v Speaker 3>It's referencing my book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's on,</v>

1388
00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:38.020
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's referenced in both books but uh,</v>

1389
00:58:38.350 --> 00:58:40.360
<v Speaker 3>in the spinal cord chapter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1390

00:59:30.951 --> 00:59:33.620
<v Speaker 1>the United States seems like it's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>nearly as potent as the stuff that</v>

1412
00:59:33.621 --> 00:59:35.990
<v Speaker 1>you're using down there.</v>

<v Speaker 1>results.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1418
00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:46.320

1419
00:59:46.321 --> 00:59:49.170
<v Speaker 3>before the last fight and then he got</v>
<v Speaker 3>his belt back and he's really done.</v>

1420
00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:50.710
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:55.130
<v Speaker 3>He got ibs and he got his shoulder done</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause he was,</v>

1423
00:59:55.440 --> 00:59:57.300
<v Speaker 3>his shoulder was really bothering them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that was,</v>

1424
00:59:57.301 --> 00:59:58.320
<v Speaker 3>that was it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he,</v>

1425
00:59:58.321 --> 01:00:00.660
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

01:00:00.661 --> 01:00:01.320
<v Speaker 3>that done.</v>

<v Speaker 3>in Baas Baas and he both said that is</v>

1431
01:00:14.191 --> 01:00:15.630
<v Speaker 3>okay to talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going down there.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1436
01:00:21.501 --> 01:00:23.690
<v Speaker 1>because of my own personal experience</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the,</v>

1437
01:00:23.691 --> 01:00:24.051
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1438
01:00:24.051 --> 01:00:26.450
<v Speaker 1>the limited amount of a stem cell</v>
<v Speaker 1>treatments that I've gotten,</v>

1439
01:00:26.451 --> 01:00:29.510
<v Speaker 1>but I've had great results.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a knee injury that was bothering</v>

1440
01:00:29.511 --> 01:00:31.250
<v Speaker 1>me forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel it at all anymore.</v>

1441
01:00:31.510 --> 01:00:32.480
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shoulder,</v>

1442
01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:34.130

1445
01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:40.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting a very watered down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not nearly as potent version of what you</v>

1446
01:00:40.851 --> 01:00:42.110
<v Speaker 1>have in Panama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
