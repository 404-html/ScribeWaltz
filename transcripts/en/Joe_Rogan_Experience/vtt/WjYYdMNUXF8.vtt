<v Speaker 1>Thanks for doing this man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate it.</v>

7
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:14.423
<v Speaker 1>Pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You come highly recommended by many </v>

8
00:00:15.841 --> 00:00:17.820
<v Speaker 1>human beings that I know well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad to hear it.</v>

9
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.310
<v Speaker 1>How do you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you get such a fine reputation?</v>

10
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.233
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been doing the same things for a </v>

11
00:00:21.811 --> 00:00:24.060
<v Speaker 1>long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just putting one foot ahead of the other</v>

12
00:00:24.061 --> 00:00:29.061
<v Speaker 1>and saying what I know to be true and </v>
<v Speaker 1>push and Macho Macho.</v>

13
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.830
<v Speaker 1>Who doesn't like Matcha tea?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is your stuff.</v>

14
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:32.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

15
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.443
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have only tasted really bad much </v>

16
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.810
<v Speaker 1>enlighten me what's know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's powdered tea and it's very,</v>

17
00:00:39.811 --> 00:00:44.811
<v Speaker 1>very finely powdered and it's very labor</v>
<v Speaker 1>intensive to prepare and it's got such a</v>

18
00:00:44.821 --> 00:00:47.280
<v Speaker 1>huge surface area that it oxidizes very </v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly.</v>

19
00:00:47.281 --> 00:00:49.710
<v Speaker 1>So if it's not properly packed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stored,</v>

20
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.870
<v Speaker 1>it loses its brilliant green color.</v>

21
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.430
<v Speaker 1>It turns yellow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>green or gray green.</v>

22
00:00:53.431 --> 00:00:56.430
<v Speaker 1>It gets bitter and loses its taste.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I got to say,</v>

23
00:00:56.431 --> 00:01:00.030
<v Speaker 1>most of the macho that I see served in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this country is of that sort.</v>

24
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.890
<v Speaker 1>And many people have never had the good </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

25
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.860
<v Speaker 1>What's the benefits of Macho?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know there's.</v>

26
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:06.870
<v Speaker 1>First of all it's been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's beautiful.</v>

27
00:01:06.871 --> 00:01:08.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've never seen a green color </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

28
00:01:08.761 --> 00:01:10.920
<v Speaker 1>It's just amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the flavors are amazing,</v>

29
00:01:10.921 --> 00:01:15.630
<v Speaker 1>but it's the only preparation of tea in </v>
<v Speaker 1>which the whole leaf is consumed and it.</v>

30
00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:16.623
<v Speaker 1>It's grown under special conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The leaves are shaded a deep shade for </v>

31
00:01:20.761 --> 00:01:24.210
<v Speaker 1>the last three weeks before harvest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the in response to that,</v>

32
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.030
<v Speaker 1>the leaves produce more chlorophyll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more antioxidants,</v>

33
00:01:27.031 --> 00:01:27.864
<v Speaker 1>more the good stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's got a much more of the things </v>

34
00:01:31.051 --> 00:01:33.150
<v Speaker 1>that you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this has like a pop top,</v>

35
00:01:33.151 --> 00:01:35.160
<v Speaker 1>like pringles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

36
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.993
<v Speaker 1>Is that so the marches and it's got to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stay fresh and fun and you want to keep </v>

37
00:01:38.611 --> 00:01:43.611
<v Speaker 1>it in the freezer and freezer and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can sift it so it doesn't form lumps.</v>

38
00:01:44.251 --> 00:01:45.084
<v Speaker 1>And then you whisk it with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>traditional bamboo whisk or you buy a </v>

39
00:01:47.461 --> 00:01:51.480
<v Speaker 1>little electric whisker and you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>whisk it in hot water or cold water.</v>

40
00:01:51.481 --> 00:01:53.650
<v Speaker 1>And it's very yummy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And w what,</v>

41
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:54.990
<v Speaker 1>what does it do for you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

42
00:01:54.991 --> 00:01:56.340
<v Speaker 1>what's the good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you've got,</v>

43
00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.670
<v Speaker 1>it's got caffeine of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you get stimulated by it,</v>

44
00:01:59.671 --> 00:02:00.504
<v Speaker 1>but it's also got [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is this relax and compound that </v>

45
00:02:03.361 --> 00:02:08.361
<v Speaker 1>modifies the effect of caffeine and </v>
<v Speaker 1>produces a state of relaxed alertness so</v>

46
00:02:08.821 --> 00:02:11.010
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't have the jangling effective </v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee.</v>

47
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.263
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're getting all of these antioxidant </v>

48
00:02:13.981 --> 00:02:15.590
<v Speaker 1>benefits that are well documented in </v>
<v Speaker 1>tea.</v>

49
00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:16.291
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

50
00:02:16.291 --> 00:02:17.124
<v Speaker 1>It's a great thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anytime you get one of these little </v>

51
00:02:18.361 --> 00:02:20.070
<v Speaker 1>whisks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's cool.</v>

52
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.800
<v Speaker 1>It's like a real bamboo made from one </v>
<v Speaker 1>piece of bamboo.</v>

53
00:02:22.801 --> 00:02:25.530
<v Speaker 1>It's a miracle of a Japanese </v>
<v Speaker 1>craftsmanship.</v>

54
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.320
<v Speaker 1>It's beautiful and it's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

55
00:02:28.321 --> 00:02:29.580
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how often do you drink this stuff?</v>

56
00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.040
<v Speaker 1>I have a bowl of it every morning and </v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

57
00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.040
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes I have a glass of iced </v>
<v Speaker 1>macho later in the day,</v>

58
00:02:35.041 --> 00:02:37.110
<v Speaker 1>especially in warm weather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just so much a fiend.</v>

59
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.910
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good thing.</v>

60
00:02:38.911 --> 00:02:42.810
<v Speaker 1>I first tasted it when I was 17.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was an exchange student in Japan.</v>

61
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.801
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

62
00:02:43.801 --> 00:02:46.650
<v Speaker 1>59.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lived with a family outside of Tokyo.</v>

63
00:02:46.651 --> 00:02:49.320
<v Speaker 1>We had no language and come and on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>second night I was there,</v>

64
00:02:49.321 --> 00:02:50.154
<v Speaker 1>the mother took me next door to her </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighbors who practice tea ceremony and </v>

65
00:02:53.611 --> 00:02:54.444
<v Speaker 1>they did this thing for me and I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinated by that whisk and the color </v>

66
00:02:57.211 --> 00:02:59.650
<v Speaker 1>of the Macho and I thought it was great.</v>

67
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:00.483
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never thought I'd be able to get it </v>

68
00:03:00.881 --> 00:03:02.740
<v Speaker 1>over here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

69
00:03:02.741 --> 00:03:03.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you,</v>

70
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.190
<v Speaker 1>you import this stuff yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was that.</v>

71
00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.780
<v Speaker 1>I started a company called Mochi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kaare.</v>

72
00:03:07.781 --> 00:03:12.620
<v Speaker 1>We've got the URL [inaudible] dot com </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I went to Japan to Eg,</v>

73
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:13.503
<v Speaker 1>which is a little town outside of Kyoto,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the center of the best tea </v>

74
00:03:17.261 --> 00:03:20.380
<v Speaker 1>production in Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I sourced really good macho,</v>

75
00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.253
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are many grades and launch of the </v>

76
00:03:21.851 --> 00:03:24.490
<v Speaker 1>most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the highest are too expensive to use for</v>

77
00:03:24.491 --> 00:03:26.560
<v Speaker 1>everyday use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're really phenomenal.</v>

78
00:03:26.561 --> 00:03:27.394
<v Speaker 1>Alex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like truffles are really expensive so </v>

79
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:32.163
<v Speaker 1>I've tried to find the best Macia that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is affordable and make it available to </v>

80
00:03:36.791 --> 00:03:38.980
<v Speaker 1>people here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like the highest level stuff.</v>

81
00:03:38.981 --> 00:03:42.630
<v Speaker 1>How much would it cost for a cup of tea?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hard to estimate for a cop,</v>

82
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:43.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it possibly.</v>

83
00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:44.683
<v Speaker 1>There's a preparation called thick tea </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Japan where they use three times the </v>

84
00:03:47.441 --> 00:03:50.500
<v Speaker 1>amount of powder and probably one bowl </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that stuff,</v>

85
00:03:50.501 --> 00:03:51.820
<v Speaker 1>which is shared by several people.</v>

86
00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be a $100 a bowl.</v>

87
00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.090
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

88
00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why,</v>

89
00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.600
<v Speaker 1>why did it catch on in Japan like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always been,</v>

90
00:04:01.601 --> 00:04:02.434
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has been in Japan for a very long </v>

91
00:04:04.151 --> 00:04:04.661
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

92
00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:05.494
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this powdered tea preparation was </v>

93
00:04:07.301 --> 00:04:09.770
<v Speaker 1>originally taken up by Zen monks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

94
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.220
<v Speaker 1>to help them stay awake during long </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours in meditation.</v>

95
00:04:12.221 --> 00:04:13.054
<v Speaker 1>It was also associated with a Samurai </v>
<v Speaker 1>and became the tea ceremony developed </v>

96
00:04:16.841 --> 00:04:17.674
<v Speaker 1>around that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there anything that is similar to it </v>

97
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.580
<v Speaker 1>is like your Vermont Tay or Guarana or </v>
<v Speaker 1>any other time?</v>

98
00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.710
<v Speaker 1>These are all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all caffeine plants,</v>

99
00:04:26.711 --> 00:04:29.220
<v Speaker 1>but in my experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>t I think,</v>

100
00:04:29.221 --> 00:04:30.054
<v Speaker 1>and it's primarily because of that Elle </v>
<v Speaker 1>fanning content of the effect is </v>

101
00:04:33.821 --> 00:04:36.400
<v Speaker 1>mellower of caffeine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you get stimulated,</v>

102
00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:37.234
<v Speaker 1>you get alert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't have the jangling </v>

103
00:04:38.501 --> 00:04:40.600
<v Speaker 1>effective a lot of these other caffeine </v>
<v Speaker 1>beverages.</v>

104
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.880
<v Speaker 1>Do you drink regular coffee as well?</v>

105
00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.200
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never drunk coffee.</v>

106
00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:45.123
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I was turned off because my </v>

107
00:04:46.451 --> 00:04:47.830
<v Speaker 1>parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was growing up,</v>

108
00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:48.693
<v Speaker 1>drank really strong black coffee with no</v>
<v Speaker 1>sugar cream and I couldn't imagine why </v>

109
00:04:51.621 --> 00:04:55.240
<v Speaker 1>people would savages and those people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were different people.</v>

110
00:04:55.241 --> 00:04:57.820
<v Speaker 1>Did you grow up in a northern climate?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in Philadelphia.</v>

111
00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:03.660
<v Speaker 1>When it's cold outside people they drink</v>
<v Speaker 1>that black coffee makes you angry.</v>

112
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dark black,</v>

113
00:05:07.931 --> 00:05:10.510
<v Speaker 1>burnt coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like bright green,</v>

114
00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:11.493
<v Speaker 1>shining Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it interesting that things that </v>

115
00:05:14.651 --> 00:05:16.590
<v Speaker 1>are good for you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many things that are good for you,</v>

116
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.550
<v Speaker 1>like bell peppers or something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

117
00:05:18.551 --> 00:05:20.400
<v Speaker 1>They have a beautiful color to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

118
00:05:20.401 --> 00:05:22.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these,</v>

119
00:05:22.031 --> 00:05:22.864
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the health benefits of fruits and </v>

120
00:05:23.831 --> 00:05:24.664
<v Speaker 1>vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of them have to do with these </v>

121
00:05:25.781 --> 00:05:29.230
<v Speaker 1>pigments and the pigments the plants </v>
<v Speaker 1>produce,</v>

122
00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.800
<v Speaker 1>they're part of their own defensive </v>
<v Speaker 1>system and they do good things in us.</v>

123
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:33.663
<v Speaker 1>And one piece of advice that I often </v>
<v Speaker 1>give people is you should try to eat </v>

124
00:05:36.611 --> 00:05:37.444
<v Speaker 1>across the color spectrum and every day </v>
<v Speaker 1>about what did you eat today that was </v>

125
00:05:40.391 --> 00:05:41.380
<v Speaker 1>red?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was purple,</v>

126
00:05:41.381 --> 00:05:42.430
<v Speaker 1>what was green,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was right.</v>

127
00:05:42.431 --> 00:05:47.290
<v Speaker 1>All of these have different benefits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that a scientific perspective?</v>

128
00:05:47.291 --> 00:05:48.530
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

129
00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.090
<v Speaker 1>These are categories of phytochemicals </v>
<v Speaker 1>are protective,</v>

130
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.943
<v Speaker 1>phyto nutrients and a lot of them are </v>
<v Speaker 1>these pigments that give a fruits and </v>

131
00:05:55.631 --> 00:05:58.010
<v Speaker 1>vegetables that are bright colors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that people</v>

132
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.390
<v Speaker 2>should very those colors and in a given </v>
<v Speaker 2>day or.</v>

133
00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.790
<v Speaker 2>I think as as much as you can across any</v>
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>

134
00:06:04.791 --> 00:06:08.090
<v Speaker 2>try to eat across the color spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good thing to aim for.</v>

135
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.133
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So just just get as many of them as in </v>

136
00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.050
<v Speaker 2>as you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

137
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.943
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So do you take this approach with </v>

138
00:06:14.241 --> 00:06:16.460
<v Speaker 2>fruits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with all sorts of different things?</v>

139
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brightly colored stuff is good.</v>

140
00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:19.513
<v Speaker 2>Do you eat meat or fish and vegetables?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just fish and vegetables now when you </v>

141
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:25.633
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things I'm super concerned </v>

142
00:06:26.781 --> 00:06:27.614
<v Speaker 2>with and I've been more concerned with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the more pay attention to it as </v>

143
00:06:29.641 --> 00:06:31.850
<v Speaker 2>sustainability when it comes to fish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

144
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:32.713
<v Speaker 2>It seems like especially ocean fish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're human beings are just terrible </v>

145
00:06:36.231 --> 00:06:37.250
<v Speaker 2>monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

146
00:06:37.251 --> 00:06:39.470
<v Speaker 2>there's a famous oceanographer in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>country,</v>

147
00:06:39.471 --> 00:06:41.720
<v Speaker 2>Sylvia Earl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was the woman that held a record for</v>

148
00:06:41.721 --> 00:06:42.554
<v Speaker 2>the deep dive and she came up to me at a</v>
<v Speaker 2>meeting once and pleaded with me not to </v>

149
00:06:46.581 --> 00:06:47.960
<v Speaker 2>recommend that people eat fish.</v>

150
00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:48.793
<v Speaker 2>He said there just aren't going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>any in the future and that's probably </v>

151
00:06:51.771 --> 00:06:52.604
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably the future is going to be </v>

152
00:06:54.381 --> 00:06:57.440
<v Speaker 2>farmed fish and that can be done in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsible way.</v>

153
00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:01.430
<v Speaker 2>You can get the good guides,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one is put out by the Monterey Aquarium.</v>

154
00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:02.293
<v Speaker 2>You can get a wallet card that lists </v>
<v Speaker 2>that lists fish and shellfish and rates </v>

155
00:07:06.351 --> 00:07:08.930
<v Speaker 2>them both by toxicity and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sustainability.</v>

156
00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:11.630
<v Speaker 2>And that's a good guide to follow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

157
00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:14.230
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mollusks mollusks I eat,</v>

158
00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:19.850
<v Speaker 2>I eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like oysters and scallops.</v>

159
00:07:19.881 --> 00:07:21.530
<v Speaker 2>I eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is,</v>

160
00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.970
<v Speaker 2>what has led you to not eat chicken or </v>
<v Speaker 2>fish or beef?</v>

161
00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:26.970
<v Speaker 2>It's been a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

162
00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:27.951
<v Speaker 2>let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

163
00:07:27.951 --> 00:07:28.784
<v Speaker 2>I think 28 and I was interested in Yoga </v>
<v Speaker 2>and people that I knew who were doing </v>

164
00:07:34.101 --> 00:07:34.934
<v Speaker 2>yoga had become vegetarian and I saw </v>
<v Speaker 2>friends of mine that had become </v>

165
00:07:37.641 --> 00:07:38.570
<v Speaker 2>vegetarian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

166
00:07:38.571 --> 00:07:39.404
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just try it for a little while and </v>

167
00:07:40.281 --> 00:07:41.114
<v Speaker 2>it agreed with me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't eat fish for a number of years </v>

168
00:07:43.371 --> 00:07:46.730
<v Speaker 2>and I found that made the international </v>
<v Speaker 2>travel very difficult,</v>

169
00:07:46.731 --> 00:07:47.840
<v Speaker 2>especially to Japan.</v>

170
00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:48.973
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I was reading about all the </v>

171
00:07:49.911 --> 00:07:50.744
<v Speaker 2>research on good stuff and fishing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started eating fish and that way of </v>

172
00:07:53.631 --> 00:07:56.480
<v Speaker 2>eating Greens with me real well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

173
00:07:56.481 --> 00:08:00.380
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is a thing that agree with you thing,</v>

174
00:08:00.381 --> 00:08:01.214
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really dependent upon the person's </v>

175
00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:03.920
<v Speaker 2>very individually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

176
00:08:03.921 --> 00:08:06.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to give blanket rules except I</v>

177
00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:08.570
<v Speaker 2>have no problem telling people to stay </v>
<v Speaker 2>away from refined,</v>

178
00:08:08.571 --> 00:08:11.210
<v Speaker 2>processed and manufactured food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the bad stuff.</v>

179
00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:12.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a really good,</v>

180
00:08:12.561 --> 00:08:15.380
<v Speaker 2>clear thing that everybody can kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>apply in their life.</v>

181
00:08:15.381 --> 00:08:17.360
<v Speaker 2>But as far as like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is gonna work for you,</v>

182
00:08:17.361 --> 00:08:19.560
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of trial and error </v>
<v Speaker 2>involved isn't absolutely.</v>

183
00:08:19.561 --> 00:08:21.800
<v Speaker 2>You got to do experiments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pay attention,</v>

184
00:08:21.801 --> 00:08:23.240
<v Speaker 2>see what works for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

185
00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:25.250
<v Speaker 2>Now you practice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would you,</v>

186
00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:26.420
<v Speaker 2>how would you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Integrative,</v>

187
00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.790
<v Speaker 2>integrative medicine?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How would you define that?</v>

188
00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:31.290
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's medicine of the future and uh,</v>

189
00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:32.153
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the short answer and the future short </v>

190
00:08:34.101 --> 00:08:34.934
<v Speaker 2>answer is that's the intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 2>combination of conventional and </v>

191
00:08:36.801 --> 00:08:38.990
<v Speaker 2>alternative medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but really it's,</v>

192
00:08:38.991 --> 00:08:39.824
<v Speaker 2>it's a system that focuses on the body's</v>
<v Speaker 2>ability to heal itself that looks at </v>

193
00:08:43.281 --> 00:08:45.740
<v Speaker 2>people as whole persons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just physical bodies,</v>

194
00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:46.903
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that takes account of all aspects of </v>

195
00:08:48.111 --> 00:08:50.270
<v Speaker 2>lifestyle and understanding health and </v>
<v Speaker 2>illness,</v>

196
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:51.383
<v Speaker 2>a values the practitioner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>patient relationship and makes use of </v>

197
00:08:53.751 --> 00:08:56.010
<v Speaker 2>all therapies no matter where they come</v>

198
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:56.843
<v Speaker 1>from that show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable evidence of efficacy and are </v>

199
00:08:58.321 --> 00:09:01.680
<v Speaker 1>not going to hurt people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I am absolutely convinced this is the</v>

200
00:09:01.681 --> 00:09:02.514
<v Speaker 1>way out of the healthcare crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been training doctors and other </v>

201
00:09:05.011 --> 00:09:07.380
<v Speaker 1>health professionals in it for many </v>
<v Speaker 1>years now.</v>

202
00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:08.753
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you say the body's ability to heal </v>

203
00:09:10.591 --> 00:09:11.424
<v Speaker 1>itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would you accentuate that with this </v>

204
00:09:13.531 --> 00:09:16.440
<v Speaker 1>to me is the thing that's most missing </v>
<v Speaker 1>from medical education?</v>

205
00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:17.483
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

206
00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:18.373
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the only time I heard the word </v>

207
00:09:20.071 --> 00:09:22.220
<v Speaker 1>healing used in medical school was in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

208
00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:23.103
<v Speaker 1>in wound healing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which in my first year course in </v>

209
00:09:25.261 --> 00:09:29.670
<v Speaker 1>histology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me the most marvelous thing about our</v>

210
00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:31.860
<v Speaker 1>bodies is that they have the capacity to</v>
<v Speaker 1>heal themselves.</v>

211
00:09:31.861 --> 00:09:34.170
<v Speaker 1>You'd get a cut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can watch it heal,</v>

212
00:09:34.171 --> 00:09:38.160
<v Speaker 1>and that happens throughout the body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Knew the DNA molecule.</v>

213
00:09:38.161 --> 00:09:41.580
<v Speaker 1>This is just a big molecule on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>border of life and non life.</v>

214
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:46.800
<v Speaker 1>It has within it the ability to know in </v>
<v Speaker 1>quotes when it's been injured,</v>

215
00:09:46.801 --> 00:09:48.840
<v Speaker 1>have a cosmic ray,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knocks a part of it out.</v>

216
00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:51.990
<v Speaker 1>Instantly it begins to manufacture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>repair enzymes that,</v>

217
00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:53.513
<v Speaker 1>that duplicate the missing piece and </v>
<v Speaker 1>paste it in and you can see that same </v>

218
00:09:56.371 --> 00:09:58.740
<v Speaker 1>thing at any level of biological </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization.</v>

219
00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.260
<v Speaker 1>And to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where good medicine should start,</v>

220
00:10:01.261 --> 00:10:04.770
<v Speaker 1>that the body has within them the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to maintain equilibrium,</v>

221
00:10:04.771 --> 00:10:07.980
<v Speaker 1>heal itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now knowing that the body has disability</v>

222
00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:09.780
<v Speaker 1>of what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you do to accentuate that?</v>

223
00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:10.320
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I,</v>

224
00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:14.400
<v Speaker 1>when I listened to a patient and hear </v>
<v Speaker 1>their story at the back of my mind,</v>

225
00:10:14.401 --> 00:10:16.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is healing not happening here,</v>

226
00:10:16.501 --> 00:10:20.040
<v Speaker 1>but what can I do from outside that can </v>
<v Speaker 1>facilitate that?</v>

227
00:10:20.041 --> 00:10:20.874
<v Speaker 1>I can't put it into somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can help it along by either </v>

228
00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:26.550
<v Speaker 1>supplying energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>missing materials,</v>

229
00:10:26.551 --> 00:10:27.900
<v Speaker 1>remove obstacles to it.</v>

230
00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.790
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you have a wound that doesn't heal.</v>

231
00:10:29.791 --> 00:10:34.020
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's a foreign body in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You remove that heals now.</v>

232
00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:34.943
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you have people that come to that </v>

233
00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:37.373
<v Speaker 1>have issues like saved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone comes to and they have a back </v>

234
00:10:39.811 --> 00:10:40.644
<v Speaker 1>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

235
00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:44.570
<v Speaker 1>Got a little bit of lower back pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you approach that from a,</v>

236
00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:47.460
<v Speaker 1>in terms of like how they're eating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how they're living their lifestyle?</v>

237
00:10:47.461 --> 00:10:51.060
<v Speaker 1>First I would question them about </v>
<v Speaker 1>lifestyle for sure.</v>

238
00:10:51.061 --> 00:10:51.660
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

239
00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:53.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a great follower of a,</v>

240
00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:56.350
<v Speaker 1>a man who died recently named John Sarno</v>
<v Speaker 1>who isn't,</v>

241
00:10:56.830 --> 00:10:57.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>veterans work.</v>

242
00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:58.820
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

243
00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:00.750
<v Speaker 1>he has some great books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind over back pain,</v>

244
00:11:00.751 --> 00:11:03.090
<v Speaker 1>healing back pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And his main belief,</v>

245
00:11:03.091 --> 00:11:03.924
<v Speaker 1>which I totally agree with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the vast majority of back pain </v>

246
00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:08.003
<v Speaker 1>is muscle spasm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which originates in the mind and it may </v>

247
00:11:11.761 --> 00:11:14.040
<v Speaker 1>localize that an area of physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>injury,</v>

248
00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:16.770
<v Speaker 1>but the injury is not the cause of it.</v>

249
00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:19.620
<v Speaker 1>You can live with a slipped disc and </v>
<v Speaker 1>have no pain.</v>

250
00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:20.883
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at x rays it defined slip </v>

251
00:11:22.291 --> 00:11:23.124
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean,</v>

252
00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:27.940
<v Speaker 1>bulging or herniated?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That does not necessarily close pain.</v>

253
00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:28.923
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and unless there's associated </v>

254
00:11:30.811 --> 00:11:31.644
<v Speaker 1>neurological symptoms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to do anything about </v>

255
00:11:33.721 --> 00:11:35.770
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's unless it's pressing on.</v>

256
00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:36.623
<v Speaker 1>Exactly right now I'm John Sarno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His idea was that it's a lot of stress </v>

257
00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:42.803
<v Speaker 1>and anxiety and a lot of different </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological factors that I'm sure he </v>

258
00:11:47.281 --> 00:11:48.114
<v Speaker 1>was some kind of incredible healer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He required the people who came to him </v>

259
00:11:51.901 --> 00:11:53.890
<v Speaker 1>come to to evening lectures that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>gave.</v>

260
00:11:53.891 --> 00:11:57.400
<v Speaker 1>That's all many people who did that lost</v>
<v Speaker 1>their back pain forever,</v>

261
00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:59.800
<v Speaker 1>just listening to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So other people have had that happen.</v>

262
00:11:59.801 --> 00:12:02.940
<v Speaker 1>Just reading his book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've read a little bit of it's,</v>

263
00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:05.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had like legitimate injuries.</v>

264
00:12:05.831 --> 00:12:08.110
<v Speaker 1>So whenever I hear someone say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

265
00:12:08.111 --> 00:12:10.570
<v Speaker 1>it's all in your head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not all in your head,</v>

266
00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.810
<v Speaker 1>it's in your head and your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your box in your head and your muscles,</v>

267
00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:14.673
<v Speaker 1>and then the problem of muscle spasm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which shuts off blood supply and it's a </v>

268
00:12:19.001 --> 00:12:22.870
<v Speaker 1>vicious cycle that that'll localize at </v>
<v Speaker 1>an area you've had physical injury,</v>

269
00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.210
<v Speaker 1>but the pain is not coming from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>injury.</v>

270
00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:26.043
<v Speaker 1>It's coming from muscle spasm and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>controlled by a greatly influenced by </v>

271
00:12:29.861 --> 00:12:31.360
<v Speaker 1>the mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you,</v>

272
00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:32.223
<v Speaker 1>when your back is like seizes up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is a muscle spasm and it's </v>

273
00:12:35.591 --> 00:12:39.280
<v Speaker 1>incredibly painful and it's located in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the area of the injury.</v>

274
00:12:39.281 --> 00:12:42.790
<v Speaker 1>So it doesn't confuse you into thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the injury that's causing you pain.</v>

275
00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:47.470
<v Speaker 1>What leads people into getting physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>interventions that may not be necessary?</v>

276
00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:50.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big believer in waiting,</v>

277
00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:51.483
<v Speaker 1>especially with spinal stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Solutely absolutely always want to fuse </v>

278
00:12:55.301 --> 00:12:58.120
<v Speaker 1>you and cut you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you look at.</v>

279
00:12:58.180 --> 00:12:59.013
<v Speaker 1>Here's another interesting thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can look at x rays of people's </v>

280
00:13:01.121 --> 00:13:04.870
<v Speaker 1>spines that looks so horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't imagine that they can move and</v>

281
00:13:04.871 --> 00:13:06.370
<v Speaker 1>they have no nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no symptoms.</v>

282
00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:07.263
<v Speaker 1>And you can look at other x-rays that </v>
<v Speaker 1>looked perfect and people are disabled </v>

283
00:13:10.391 --> 00:13:11.224
<v Speaker 1>by pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a very low correlation </v>

284
00:13:12.581 --> 00:13:16.210
<v Speaker 1>between physical findings and subjective</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

285
00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:17.830
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is Sarno recommend?</v>

286
00:13:17.831 --> 00:13:20.200
<v Speaker 1>I never really recommends going about </v>
<v Speaker 1>your business.</v>

287
00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:21.083
<v Speaker 1>Go nobody even ignoring it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going about your business and if </v>

288
00:13:23.051 --> 00:13:24.880
<v Speaker 1>possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to figure out what,</v>

289
00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:27.970
<v Speaker 1>what message you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your mind descending down there.</v>

290
00:13:27.971 --> 00:13:31.750
<v Speaker 1>But basically it's a reassurance that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll go away on its own.</v>

291
00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:36.900
<v Speaker 1>So when he does these lectures and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>has people cures him of it is just,</v>

292
00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:40.690
<v Speaker 1>he just reassuring them that </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's going to in this process of</v>

293
00:13:40.691 --> 00:13:43.030
<v Speaker 1>how he calls the tension Myositis </v>
<v Speaker 1>Syndrome.</v>

294
00:13:43.031 --> 00:13:45.310
<v Speaker 1>And he explains the mechanism of how it </v>
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>

295
00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:47.710
<v Speaker 1>One friend of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was in his late twenties,</v>

296
00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:49.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>played basketball,</v>

297
00:13:49.721 --> 00:13:50.554
<v Speaker 1>had a very serious herniated discs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was within hours of having the real </v>

298
00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:57.820
<v Speaker 1>logical surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spinal surgery.</v>

299
00:13:57.821 --> 00:14:01.210
<v Speaker 1>And I yelled at him to read this book </v>
<v Speaker 1>and CSR News in New York.</v>

300
00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:02.980
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe any of.</v>

301
00:14:02.981 --> 00:14:04.350
<v Speaker 1>That's all bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

302
00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:05.140
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go see him.</v>

303
00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:06.200
<v Speaker 1>So he went the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

304
00:14:06.201 --> 00:14:09.160
<v Speaker 1>it went through the evening lectures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thought this was nonsense,</v>

305
00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:10.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went home,</v>

306
00:14:10.751 --> 00:14:13.090
<v Speaker 1>was having dinner and realized his back </v>
<v Speaker 1>pain was gone,</v>

307
00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:14.043
<v Speaker 1>never had surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's really know Scott to be something </v>

308
00:14:19.931 --> 00:14:20.471
<v Speaker 1>to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

309
00:14:20.471 --> 00:14:22.750
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something to the placebo effect.</v>

310
00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:24.120
<v Speaker 1>So if there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

311
00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:24.953
<v Speaker 1>if that is a real thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can convince your body that it's </v>

312
00:14:26.921 --> 00:14:27.754
<v Speaker 1>got the medicine that it needs and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>starts to heal even though there's no </v>

313
00:14:29.501 --> 00:14:30.334
<v Speaker 1>medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's got to be something that is </v>

314
00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:35.950
<v Speaker 1>working against you as well with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong mindset.</v>

315
00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:39.490
<v Speaker 1>It's funny to me to hear people </v>
<v Speaker 1>rediscovering the placebo effect.</v>

316
00:14:39.491 --> 00:14:42.130
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote a book in 1983 called health and</v>

317
00:14:42.131 --> 00:14:44.230
<v Speaker 1>healing and had two chapters in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One Placebos.</v>

318
00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:45.363
<v Speaker 1>And what I wrote is that the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem is that we know when we talk </v>

319
00:14:49.271 --> 00:14:50.980
<v Speaker 1>about placebos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in phrases like,</v>

320
00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:53.240
<v Speaker 1>how do you know that's not just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>placebo effect.</v>

321
00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:54.103
<v Speaker 1>The most interesting word there is just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or we have to rule out the placebo </v>

322
00:14:57.261 --> 00:14:59.150
<v Speaker 1>effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We shouldn't be rolling it in,</v>

323
00:14:59.151 --> 00:15:00.830
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the meat of medicine.</v>

324
00:15:00.831 --> 00:15:01.664
<v Speaker 1>That's pure healing from within mediated</v>
<v Speaker 1>by belief on mixed up with the direct </v>

325
00:15:05.541 --> 00:15:07.610
<v Speaker 1>effects of treatment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you want to make happen more</v>

326
00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:08.483
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just is a mind fuck for a lot of </v>

327
00:15:09.921 --> 00:15:10.754
<v Speaker 1>people because they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how am I trick myself into getting </v>

328
00:15:12.141 --> 00:15:13.460
<v Speaker 1>better?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why can't I just do it?</v>

329
00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:16.840
<v Speaker 1>Because that must have something to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the structure of the brain that the</v>

330
00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:20.230
<v Speaker 1>part of the brain in which our will is </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't,</v>

331
00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:21.123
<v Speaker 1>doesn't connect directly to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>machinery of the body to the autonomic </v>

332
00:15:24.951 --> 00:15:25.784
<v Speaker 1>nervous system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to find some way of getting </v>

333
00:15:26.871 --> 00:15:27.704
<v Speaker 1>around that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One way is to project belief onto </v>

334
00:15:29.121 --> 00:15:32.570
<v Speaker 1>something external and then let it work </v>
<v Speaker 1>for you.</v>

335
00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:33.493
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's so strange that the mind </v>

336
00:15:35.661 --> 00:15:36.230
<v Speaker 1>works that way.</v>

337
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:37.063
<v Speaker 1>It would seem like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't it be an evolutionary </v>

338
00:15:38.241 --> 00:15:40.220
<v Speaker 1>advantage?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just have it at access,</v>

339
00:15:40.221 --> 00:15:41.054
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

340
00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:41.930
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be nice,</v>

341
00:15:41.931 --> 00:15:42.890
<v Speaker 1>but that's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

342
00:15:42.891 --> 00:15:43.724
<v Speaker 1>it's a similar problem to why can't you </v>
<v Speaker 1>just get high without taking a drug the </v>

343
00:15:47.301 --> 00:15:49.100
<v Speaker 1>highest in your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not in the drug.</v>

344
00:15:49.101 --> 00:15:52.940
<v Speaker 1>The drug is a trigger that releases it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why can't we just sit down and say,</v>

345
00:15:52.941 --> 00:15:53.774
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be high for the next 10 </v>

346
00:15:54.201 --> 00:15:55.730
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the same thing,</v>

347
00:15:55.731 --> 00:15:58.420
<v Speaker 1>we don't have access to those controls </v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

348
00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:02.720
<v Speaker 1>It just seems like that one though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Healing getting better.</v>

349
00:16:02.721 --> 00:16:05.840
<v Speaker 1>That one seems like it's something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we should as a culture concentrate on.</v>

350
00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:07.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

351
00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:10.220
<v Speaker 1>What we really concentrate on is actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>medicine,</v>

352
00:16:10.221 --> 00:16:11.054
<v Speaker 1>but one way to concentrate that is by </v>
<v Speaker 1>giving people greater confidence in </v>

353
00:16:13.731 --> 00:16:14.564
<v Speaker 1>their body's ability to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And doctors have great power to do that </v>

354
00:16:17.451 --> 00:16:19.730
<v Speaker 1>because patients project a lot of belief</v>
<v Speaker 1>on them.</v>

355
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:23.330
<v Speaker 1>I've had many patients over the years </v>
<v Speaker 1>who said that the most important thing I</v>

356
00:16:23.331 --> 00:16:24.164
<v Speaker 1>did for them was that I was the only </v>
<v Speaker 1>doctor who told them they could get </v>

357
00:16:26.061 --> 00:16:27.230
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

358
00:16:27.231 --> 00:16:30.270
<v Speaker 1>astonishing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

359
00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:31.903
<v Speaker 1>Is it because doctors had just seen too </v>
<v Speaker 1>many patients and they're overwhelmed </v>

360
00:16:34.581 --> 00:16:37.160
<v Speaker 1>and they got legal bills and they have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think some.</v>

361
00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:41.600
<v Speaker 1>I've thought about this a lot and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's also the negative side of this.</v>

362
00:16:41.601 --> 00:16:42.434
<v Speaker 1>I've seen what a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something called medical hexing </v>

363
00:16:44.241 --> 00:16:45.074
<v Speaker 1>in which Dr say things that actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>interfere with healing or caused people </v>

364
00:16:48.891 --> 00:16:49.724
<v Speaker 1>to get worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think a lot of this is done </v>

365
00:16:51.051 --> 00:16:52.810
<v Speaker 1>unconsciously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

366
00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:55.580
<v Speaker 1>so here's one of my thoughts in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>training.</v>

367
00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:57.200
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr,</v>

368
00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:58.123
<v Speaker 1>see a very skewed sample of sick people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They see very sick people in hospitals </v>

369
00:17:01.941 --> 00:17:04.580
<v Speaker 1>and in that group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>healing is less likely to happen,</v>

370
00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:07.670
<v Speaker 1>but if you look at the total spectrum of</v>
<v Speaker 1>illness,</v>

371
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.460
<v Speaker 1>the vast majority of things get better </v>
<v Speaker 1>on their own.</v>

372
00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:11.803
<v Speaker 1>So I think observing in yourself for </v>
<v Speaker 1>wound healing is a good one to start </v>

373
00:17:16.251 --> 00:17:19.130
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get greater confidence in your body's</v>

374
00:17:19.131 --> 00:17:21.320
<v Speaker 1>ability to do things that's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>valuable.</v>

375
00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:25.520
<v Speaker 1>So this obviously you're not talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about catastrophic injuries,</v>

376
00:17:25.521 --> 00:17:26.354
<v Speaker 1>you just talking about general wellness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think even in the case of a </v>

377
00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:31.520
<v Speaker 1>catastrophic injury,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this stuff operates.</v>

378
00:17:31.521 --> 00:17:35.480
<v Speaker 1>I worked a lot with hypnotherapists over</v>
<v Speaker 1>the years and one of the,</v>

379
00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:36.760
<v Speaker 1>one of my colleagues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

380
00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:37.693
<v Speaker 1>did a lot of work in training paramedics</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be really careful about what you say </v>

381
00:17:41.331 --> 00:17:44.150
<v Speaker 1>around unconscious people who've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>massively injured.</v>

382
00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:45.321
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

383
00:17:45.321 --> 00:17:46.220
<v Speaker 1>when the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if a,</v>

384
00:17:46.221 --> 00:17:49.830
<v Speaker 1>if a paramedic takes an automobile </v>
<v Speaker 1>accident victim and they're putting them</v>

385
00:17:49.831 --> 00:17:51.240
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>says this one's a corner.</v>

386
00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:52.403
<v Speaker 1>That is a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know the unconscious mind on and on </v>

387
00:17:56.041 --> 00:17:58.440
<v Speaker 1>the other hand you say something </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposite to a person.</v>

388
00:17:58.530 --> 00:17:59.363
<v Speaker 1>You can see cases where you can stop </v>
<v Speaker 1>bleeding in unconscious people severely </v>

389
00:18:03.361 --> 00:18:05.250
<v Speaker 1>injured just by giving them suggestions.</v>

390
00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:06.930
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

391
00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:12.780
<v Speaker 1>So when you're saying someone's a goner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you trigger stress.</v>

392
00:18:12.781 --> 00:18:15.160
<v Speaker 1>Are you trigger helplessness?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what happened?</v>

393
00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:19.170
<v Speaker 1>A medically trained person tell you that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to live.</v>

394
00:18:19.171 --> 00:18:20.370
<v Speaker 1>That's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a curse.</v>

395
00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:22.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's saying well hex.</v>

396
00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:23.003
<v Speaker 1>How strange is it that sometimes your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life is hanging on the border of you </v>

397
00:18:26.701 --> 00:18:29.760
<v Speaker 1>believing you're going to be okay and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you believe in you're not going to be.</v>

398
00:18:29.761 --> 00:18:31.530
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you want to be very careful about,</v>

399
00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:33.540
<v Speaker 1>you know whose hands you place yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

400
00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:34.603
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never want to stay in treatment with a </v>

401
00:18:36.421 --> 00:18:39.040
<v Speaker 1>doctor who thinks she can't get better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A negative doctor.</v>

402
00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:40.253
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doctors are just like every other </v>

403
00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:42.413
<v Speaker 1>occupation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's people that are really good at </v>

404
00:18:43.321 --> 00:18:46.310
<v Speaker 1>it and it really concentrated and </v>
<v Speaker 1>focused and there's people that are half</v>

405
00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:47.173
<v Speaker 1>ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the ones I trained through our </v>

406
00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:50.731
<v Speaker 1>University of Arizona Center for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Integrative Medicine get it.</v>

407
00:18:50.731 --> 00:18:51.660
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're putting out.</v>

408
00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:52.523
<v Speaker 1>We've graduated about 1600 physicians </v>
<v Speaker 1>now from very intensive training there </v>

409
00:18:56.281 --> 00:18:57.114
<v Speaker 1>in practice all over the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Teaching other people's is a good thing </v>

410
00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:00.810
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you say integrative medicine,</v>

411
00:19:00.811 --> 00:19:01.644
<v Speaker 1>when they're in practice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are they essentially general </v>

412
00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:04.333
<v Speaker 1>practitioners?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've trained people from all </v>

413
00:19:05.701 --> 00:19:07.860
<v Speaker 1>specialties and specialty you can name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've trained them,</v>

414
00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:11.670
<v Speaker 1>so orthopedic surgeons and neurologists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dermatologists,</v>

415
00:19:11.671 --> 00:19:15.660
<v Speaker 1>anything you could ever do and so you </v>
<v Speaker 1>try to tend to look at them.</v>

416
00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:17.970
<v Speaker 1>We teach them all the things they didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>get in medical school,</v>

417
00:19:17.971 --> 00:19:18.900
<v Speaker 1>nutrition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind,</v>

418
00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:19.743
<v Speaker 1>body interactions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strengths and weaknesses of alternative </v>

419
00:19:22.051 --> 00:19:23.100
<v Speaker 1>medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>herbal medicine,</v>

420
00:19:23.101 --> 00:19:23.934
<v Speaker 1>all that like say someone comes to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe they have a bad case of </v>

421
00:19:26.221 --> 00:19:28.590
<v Speaker 1>psoriasis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>autoimmune issue like that.</v>

422
00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:29.603
<v Speaker 1>Prime prime target for mind body </v>
<v Speaker 1>medicine for traditional Chinese </v>

423
00:19:33.931 --> 00:19:34.764
<v Speaker 1>medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which often works well and in that </v>

424
00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:39.840
<v Speaker 1>dietary change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people on an anti inflammatory diet,</v>

425
00:19:39.841 --> 00:19:42.300
<v Speaker 1>use of natural products that reduce </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflammation,</v>

426
00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:43.433
<v Speaker 1>so there's a wide range of things to </v>
<v Speaker 1>choose from and this does not reject </v>

427
00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:47.340
<v Speaker 1>conventional treatment.</v>

428
00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:50.250
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we may use conventional medication,</v>

429
00:19:50.251 --> 00:19:53.790
<v Speaker 1>but if you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I recommend using the lowest dose of the</v>

430
00:19:53.791 --> 00:19:54.624
<v Speaker 1>least potent agent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Start off with that and you can ramp up </v>

431
00:19:56.941 --> 00:19:58.140
<v Speaker 1>if you need to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

432
00:19:58.141 --> 00:20:00.780
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people and me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm definitely guilty of this.</v>

433
00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:01.643
<v Speaker 1>They hear terms like holistic or eastern</v>
<v Speaker 1>medicine or Chinese medicine to go </v>

434
00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:08.470
<v Speaker 1>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

435
00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:13.630
<v Speaker 1>Well I have a good bullshit detector too</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I'm really careful about what I,</v>

436
00:20:13.631 --> 00:20:15.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>accept and what I know.</v>

437
00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:16.620
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

438
00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:17.483
<v Speaker 1>what do you not buy into?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you see your bullshit </v>

439
00:20:19.981 --> 00:20:21.350
<v Speaker 1>detector,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what were you.</v>

440
00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:22.420
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

441
00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:23.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

442
00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:23.983
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't see any basis for crystal </v>

443
00:20:26.041 --> 00:20:29.040
<v Speaker 1>healing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crystal my pocket right now.</v>

444
00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:29.903
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

445
00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:31.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>too bad.</v>

446
00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:35.100
<v Speaker 1>How about the colonic irrigation people </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell you,</v>

447
00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:39.240
<v Speaker 1>tell you that they see a watermelon </v>
<v Speaker 1>seeds coming out and you haven't eaten a</v>

448
00:20:39.241 --> 00:20:41.190
<v Speaker 1>watermelon in months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's bullshit.</v>

449
00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:42.053
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lining of the Gi track sloughed off </v>

450
00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:48.130
<v Speaker 1>and is regenerated every 24 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no way that things can get</v>

451
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:49.440
<v Speaker 2>encrusted there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

452
00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:52.240
<v Speaker 2>that's a weird one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The colonic thing,</v>

453
00:20:52.241 --> 00:20:56.560
<v Speaker 2>because your body has all this natural </v>
<v Speaker 2>bacteria that you're supposed to keep in</v>

454
00:20:56.561 --> 00:20:57.040
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

455
00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:57.873
<v Speaker 2>Not only keeping there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're finding out that that's like more </v>

456
00:20:59.711 --> 00:21:02.140
<v Speaker 2>and more really important determinant of</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>

457
00:21:02.141 --> 00:21:04.150
<v Speaker 2>of general health,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of mental health to.</v>

458
00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:05.290
<v Speaker 2>Fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

459
00:21:05.291 --> 00:21:07.390
<v Speaker 2>Whose idea was it to start doing those </v>
<v Speaker 2>colonics?</v>

460
00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:12.430
<v Speaker 2>That muscular way back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of like a wacky idea.</v>

461
00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:14.530
<v Speaker 2>Pumps water up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See what's up.</v>

462
00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:16.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you have to stand there when it gets</v>

463
00:21:16.931 --> 00:21:18.010
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's addictive too.</v>

464
00:21:18.011 --> 00:21:20.000
<v Speaker 2>I see people get addicted to this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

465
00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:21.113
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So out of all the things I won't go </v>

466
00:21:22.151 --> 00:21:22.984
<v Speaker 2>further into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My wife had it done once and she was </v>

467
00:21:25.571 --> 00:21:26.560
<v Speaker 2>describing it to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

468
00:21:26.561 --> 00:21:29.020
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to pass some lady's looking at</v>

469
00:21:29.021 --> 00:21:31.300
<v Speaker 2>the two and telling you what's going on </v>
<v Speaker 2>in their life.</v>

470
00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:33.520
<v Speaker 2>At some point the is like looking at </v>
<v Speaker 2>your shit.</v>

471
00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:37.200
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It started as early as 1500 BC evers,</v>

472
00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:38.103
<v Speaker 2>pop piracy in ancient Egyptian medical </v>
<v Speaker 2>document described the many benefits of </v>

473
00:21:42.101 --> 00:21:42.934
<v Speaker 2>colon cleansing in ancient times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The practice of cleansing the colon was </v>

474
00:21:46.091 --> 00:21:51.091
<v Speaker 2>administered in a river by using a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hollow reed to induce water to flow into</v>

475
00:21:51.251 --> 00:21:52.084
<v Speaker 2>the rectum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't want to drink downstream of </v>

476
00:21:53.291 --> 00:21:54.320
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

477
00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:55.030
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

478
00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:55.540
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

479
00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:56.373
<v Speaker 2>there's no need to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you want to do is make sure that </v>

480
00:21:58.571 --> 00:21:59.404
<v Speaker 2>things are going through in the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>direction regularly and it cleans </v>

481
00:22:02.621 --> 00:22:04.510
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how it's supposed to do it,</v>

482
00:22:04.511 --> 00:22:05.020
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

483
00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:06.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another big one.</v>

484
00:22:06.281 --> 00:22:08.290
<v Speaker 2>I hear all these people that talk about </v>
<v Speaker 2>detox,</v>

485
00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:11.140
<v Speaker 2>detoxification and sell all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>products.</v>

486
00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:12.213
<v Speaker 2>The body has many natural methods of </v>
<v Speaker 2>purifying itself and getting rid of </v>

487
00:22:16.421 --> 00:22:18.790
<v Speaker 2>things with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other one is through sweating.</v>

488
00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:23.470
<v Speaker 2>A one is through breathing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one is through urination,</v>

489
00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:25.750
<v Speaker 2>one is through colonic elimination.</v>

490
00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:26.913
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the liver has an incredible capacity to </v>

491
00:22:29.621 --> 00:22:31.600
<v Speaker 2>detoxify.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can take,</v>

492
00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:33.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you put something into your body,</v>

493
00:22:33.670 --> 00:22:34.503
<v Speaker 2>the liver within seconds of seeing a </v>
<v Speaker 2>compound that has never seen before can </v>

494
00:22:38.621 --> 00:22:41.740
<v Speaker 2>begin making a specific enzyme to take </v>
<v Speaker 2>that apart and get rid of it.</v>

495
00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:43.143
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can amputate half of the liver </v>

496
00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:49.350
<v Speaker 2>and it can regenerate within 36 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's?</v>

497
00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:50.740
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>livers amazing.</v>

498
00:22:50.741 --> 00:22:51.930
<v Speaker 2>Thirty six hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

499
00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:54.580
<v Speaker 2>So I thought when you gave someone like </v>
<v Speaker 2>half your liver,</v>

500
00:22:54.581 --> 00:22:58.030
<v Speaker 2>if there was like a liver transplant </v>
<v Speaker 2>issue that took a long time.</v>

501
00:22:58.031 --> 00:23:00.830
<v Speaker 2>I know liberty can regenerate really </v>
<v Speaker 2>quickly and there's sand.</v>

502
00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:01.713
<v Speaker 2>There's a natural product that you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>take that most doctors don't learn </v>

503
00:23:04.601 --> 00:23:05.950
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cold milk thistle,</v>

504
00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:09.190
<v Speaker 2>you've probably heard of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That revs up liver metabolism,</v>

505
00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:12.010
<v Speaker 2>so you know these are all simple ways to</v>
<v Speaker 2>increase,</v>

506
00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:12.873
<v Speaker 2>but the first rule of detoxification,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you can guess you stopped </v>

507
00:23:16.511 --> 00:23:17.344
<v Speaker 2>putting toxic things in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cut it off at the pass and let it let </v>

508
00:23:21.011 --> 00:23:23.230
<v Speaker 2>the body get purifies all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

509
00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:24.243
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you do when someone's a </v>

510
00:23:25.511 --> 00:23:28.360
<v Speaker 2>cigarette smoker?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You tell them to set a date.</v>

511
00:23:28.361 --> 00:23:29.194
<v Speaker 2>The quit set a date.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the most important thing because </v>

512
00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:34.780
<v Speaker 2>each attempt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter if you succeed,</v>

513
00:23:34.810 --> 00:23:39.730
<v Speaker 2>it's making the attempt to quit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>goes into a reservoir of motivation.</v>

514
00:23:39.731 --> 00:23:42.100
<v Speaker 2>That one day will be fallen off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That it's easy,</v>

515
00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:44.920
<v Speaker 2>and this by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>happens with heroin.</v>

516
00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:46.130
<v Speaker 2>Addicts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>happens with cigarette</v>

517
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:48.200
<v Speaker 1>addicts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen many people,</v>

518
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:50.770
<v Speaker 1>lifelong cigarette addict struggled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gave it up,</v>

519
00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:51.643
<v Speaker 1>came back one day they wake up and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at stain fingers or a dirty ash </v>

520
00:23:55.101 --> 00:23:57.560
<v Speaker 1>tray and they don't want to do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore and it's an easy.</v>

521
00:23:57.650 --> 00:24:00.120
<v Speaker 1>There's no struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same thing with heroin addicts,</v>

522
00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:00.973
<v Speaker 1>so it has to do with motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't put that into another person </v>

523
00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:04.913
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All you can do is arrange circumstances </v>

524
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:07.543
<v Speaker 1>that maybe it'll happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the most important thing is to help </v>

525
00:24:08.961 --> 00:24:13.610
<v Speaker 1>you to set a date to quit and it doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>matter if they how long they stick,</v>

526
00:24:13.611 --> 00:24:14.444
<v Speaker 1>but you're saying there's actually some </v>
<v Speaker 1>strength to be gained from failed </v>

527
00:24:16.641 --> 00:24:17.630
<v Speaker 1>attempts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

528
00:24:17.631 --> 00:24:21.300
<v Speaker 1>It's making the attempt that you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>credit for really interesting.</v>

529
00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:22.193
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the more like say if you're a drunk </v>

530
00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:26.870
<v Speaker 1>and you keep falling off the wagon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you just keep making these attempts.</v>

531
00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:29.000
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No really.</v>

532
00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:33.080
<v Speaker 1>So there's something ramps up in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind that makes it more feasible for you</v>

533
00:24:33.081 --> 00:24:34.190
<v Speaker 1>to quit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

534
00:24:34.191 --> 00:24:35.870
<v Speaker 1>And when it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it happens,</v>

535
00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:38.240
<v Speaker 1>there's no struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

536
00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:39.240
<v Speaker 1>it's not an issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>

537
00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:40.103
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to do it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what do you do when people come to </v>

538
00:24:43.251 --> 00:24:46.280
<v Speaker 1>you and they're on antidepressants?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

539
00:24:46.281 --> 00:24:48.440
<v Speaker 1>I have a book called spontaneous </v>
<v Speaker 1>happiness,</v>

540
00:24:48.441 --> 00:24:51.710
<v Speaker 1>which is about emotional wellness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a lot there about antidepressants.</v>

541
00:24:51.711 --> 00:24:53.060
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't work so well.</v>

542
00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:53.953
<v Speaker 1>You know that sometimes they work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's hard to distinguish them </v>

543
00:24:57.351 --> 00:24:58.900
<v Speaker 1>from placebos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

544
00:24:58.910 --> 00:25:00.650
<v Speaker 1>the popular ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Ssri,</v>

545
00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:03.020
<v Speaker 1>and now because they don't work so well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

546
00:25:03.021 --> 00:25:07.040
<v Speaker 1>what doctors do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they added one psychotic drug.</v>

547
00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:10.250
<v Speaker 1>Horrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are for major mental illness.</v>

548
00:25:10.251 --> 00:25:13.130
<v Speaker 1>They're not things you just add on to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make the antidepressant work better.</v>

549
00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:17.720
<v Speaker 1>We've talked about that one ad nauseum </v>
<v Speaker 1>on this podcast because it turned out to</v>

550
00:25:17.721 --> 00:25:21.320
<v Speaker 1>be the most prescribed drug in America </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I can't believe that.</v>

551
00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:23.000
<v Speaker 1>That's just astounding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

552
00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:28.060
<v Speaker 1>the word is that 25 percent of women </v>
<v Speaker 1>between 40 and 50 are on antidepressants</v>

553
00:25:30.501 --> 00:25:34.130
<v Speaker 1>in 10 percent of adults in the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

554
00:25:34.131 --> 00:25:35.690
<v Speaker 1>Now here's another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a crazy number.</v>

555
00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:36.310
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

556
00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:37.143
<v Speaker 1>the pharmaceutical companies have done a</v>
<v Speaker 1>great job of convincing people that </v>

557
00:25:40.191 --> 00:25:44.810
<v Speaker 1>ordinary states of sadness are problems </v>
<v Speaker 1>of brain biochemistry,</v>

558
00:25:44.811 --> 00:25:46.220
<v Speaker 1>that you have to be treated with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>drug.</v>

559
00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:47.900
<v Speaker 1>We're not supposed to be happier with </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

560
00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:49.393
<v Speaker 1>Secondly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a big problem with a lot of the </v>

561
00:25:52.341 --> 00:25:55.550
<v Speaker 1>medications that we use in </v>
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants are a good example.</v>

562
00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:58.460
<v Speaker 1>Most of the medications we use are </v>
<v Speaker 1>counteractive.</v>

563
00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:01.230
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they oppose some process in the body.</v>

564
00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:04.460
<v Speaker 1>So when you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the body pushes back against it,</v>

565
00:26:04.461 --> 00:26:06.040
<v Speaker 1>that's called homeostasis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

566
00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:09.470
<v Speaker 1>an easy example you can relate to as if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a stuffed up nose,</v>

567
00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:13.910
<v Speaker 1>you spray a drug in it that decongestant</v>
<v Speaker 1>you miraculous,</v>

568
00:26:13.911 --> 00:26:14.744
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can breeze and depending on which </v>

569
00:26:16.101 --> 00:26:17.390
<v Speaker 1>drug you use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two hours,</v>

570
00:26:17.391 --> 00:26:19.250
<v Speaker 1>four hours at lasts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when it wears off,</v>

571
00:26:19.251 --> 00:26:21.200
<v Speaker 1>you have rebound congestion that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>

572
00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:26.060
<v Speaker 1>If you use another dose of the drug,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then very easy to slide into a Jamie,</v>

573
00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:29.960
<v Speaker 1>very easy to slide into a state of </v>
<v Speaker 1>dependence on it.</v>

574
00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:32.480
<v Speaker 1>Same thing happens with many of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs,</v>

575
00:26:32.481 --> 00:26:35.180
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they raise serotonin levels,</v>

576
00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:36.680
<v Speaker 1>neuro junction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neural junctions.</v>

577
00:26:36.681 --> 00:26:41.210
<v Speaker 1>So what is the body going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you force an increase in Serotonin,</v>

578
00:26:41.211 --> 00:26:44.490
<v Speaker 1>it's going to make less serotonin and </v>
<v Speaker 1>drop serotonin</v>

579
00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:45.323
<v Speaker 2>receptors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you stay on one of these for any </v>

580
00:26:46.771 --> 00:26:47.604
<v Speaker 2>length of time when you get off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna be in worse shape than you </v>

581
00:26:50.671 --> 00:26:52.950
<v Speaker 2>were to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is now has a medical name.</v>

582
00:26:52.951 --> 00:26:53.784
<v Speaker 2>It's called tardive dysphoria,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning lingering bad mood due to the </v>

583
00:26:56.881 --> 00:26:57.714
<v Speaker 2>drug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the drug actually prolongs or </v>

584
00:26:59.401 --> 00:27:01.560
<v Speaker 2>intensifies the depression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

585
00:27:01.561 --> 00:27:02.281
<v Speaker 2>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

586
00:27:02.281 --> 00:27:05.070
<v Speaker 2>for very short term use of very severe </v>
<v Speaker 2>depression,</v>

587
00:27:05.071 --> 00:27:08.670
<v Speaker 2>but these are not things you want to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>on and stay on for a length of time.</v>

588
00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:09.683
<v Speaker 2>What's fascinating to me is when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>talked to people that are on them that </v>

589
00:27:12.481 --> 00:27:13.314
<v Speaker 2>want to talk to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they're on some cancer medication </v>

590
00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:19.280
<v Speaker 2>or they're on something that cures </v>
<v Speaker 2>polio,</v>

591
00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:20.243
<v Speaker 2>like they make it seem like you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>insensitive to the possibility that </v>

592
00:27:23.371 --> 00:27:25.950
<v Speaker 2>there's other solutions and there are </v>
<v Speaker 2>many other solutions.</v>

593
00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:26.793
<v Speaker 2>We have really good evidence for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>antidepressant effect of physical </v>

594
00:27:30.001 --> 00:27:30.540
<v Speaker 2>activity.</v>

595
00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:32.880
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both to prevent and treat.</v>

596
00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:34.433
<v Speaker 2>We have very good evidence for </v>
<v Speaker 2>supplemental fish oil for omega three </v>

597
00:27:37.471 --> 00:27:38.304
<v Speaker 2>fatty acids to prevent and cbds well and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the microbiome looks like it's involved </v>

598
00:27:43.771 --> 00:27:45.480
<v Speaker 2>in our mental states as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

599
00:27:45.481 --> 00:27:47.910
<v Speaker 2>there's so many different ways of cbd </v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

600
00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:48.773
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets back to inflammation and it gets </v>

601
00:27:51.331 --> 00:27:52.164
<v Speaker 2>back to in an integrative approach and </v>
<v Speaker 2>not just relying on a single thing like </v>

602
00:27:55.741 --> 00:27:57.240
<v Speaker 2>a pharmaceutical treatment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

603
00:27:57.241 --> 00:27:58.074
<v Speaker 2>I've talked to intelligent people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are on Ssri in one form or another and </v>

604
00:28:01.711 --> 00:28:02.544
<v Speaker 2>even ones that have struggled were on </v>
<v Speaker 2>one for awhile and then it stopped </v>

605
00:28:04.801 --> 00:28:05.634
<v Speaker 2>working and then they tried another one </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're combining ones and they're </v>

606
00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:09.173
<v Speaker 2>on this weird sort of chemical </v>
<v Speaker 2>rollercoaster and they reject any </v>

607
00:28:13.861 --> 00:28:15.900
<v Speaker 2>possible notion that there's other </v>
<v Speaker 2>alternatives,</v>

608
00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:18.270
<v Speaker 2>especially when you bring up the </v>
<v Speaker 2>exercise one,</v>

609
00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:20.130
<v Speaker 2>I bring up the exercise one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go,</v>

610
00:28:20.131 --> 00:28:22.200
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this fucking meathead exercise.</v>

611
00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:24.060
<v Speaker 2>We just stopped and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you.</v>

612
00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:26.423
<v Speaker 2>We did this thing with my friends called</v>
<v Speaker 2>sober October and what we did is we no </v>

613
00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:32.790
<v Speaker 2>alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no anything for the month of October,</v>

614
00:28:32.791 --> 00:28:36.390
<v Speaker 2>but also we did this fitness challenge </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we got really carried away and we're</v>

615
00:28:36.391 --> 00:28:38.490
<v Speaker 2>all competing against each other with </v>
<v Speaker 2>this heart rate APP,</v>

616
00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:40.890
<v Speaker 2>so we're working out three hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four hours a day.</v>

617
00:28:40.891 --> 00:28:41.724
<v Speaker 2>It was crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what was interesting about it to me </v>

618
00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:44.513
<v Speaker 2>was not just that your body sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>adapts when you force it to work out </v>

619
00:28:46.891 --> 00:28:50.010
<v Speaker 2>that many hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that your mood is phenomenal.</v>

620
00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:52.190
<v Speaker 2>I've felt so good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

621
00:28:52.290 --> 00:28:54.780
<v Speaker 2>and I was telling everybody if you could</v>
<v Speaker 2>take what I like,</v>

622
00:28:54.781 --> 00:28:57.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel that good right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I felt great,</v>

623
00:28:57.931 --> 00:28:58.764
<v Speaker 2>but I don't feel as good as I did during</v>
<v Speaker 2>October because I was working out four </v>

624
00:29:01.351 --> 00:29:02.184
<v Speaker 2>hours a day.</v>

625
00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:06.060
<v Speaker 2>It was if you could get that in pill </v>
<v Speaker 2>form,</v>

626
00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:07.163
<v Speaker 2>you would take it every day if there was</v>
<v Speaker 2>no side effects because it literally </v>

627
00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:14.250
<v Speaker 2>removed anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the internal chatter,</v>

628
00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:16.530
<v Speaker 2>all the negative chatter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was gone.</v>

629
00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:18.570
<v Speaker 2>Everything seemed amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>True.</v>

630
00:29:18.571 --> 00:29:21.090
<v Speaker 2>And there are side effects of physical </v>
<v Speaker 2>activity are great.</v>

631
00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:22.890
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it revs up immune function,</v>

632
00:29:22.891 --> 00:29:25.830
<v Speaker 2>improves the gesture and sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that you mentioned,</v>

633
00:29:25.831 --> 00:29:28.590
<v Speaker 2>the anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the by far in a way,</v>

634
00:29:28.591 --> 00:29:31.440
<v Speaker 2>the most effective treatment I found for</v>
<v Speaker 2>anxiety is simple,</v>

635
00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:34.410
<v Speaker 2>a simple breathing technique,</v>
<v Speaker 2>regulating the breath.</v>

636
00:29:34.411 --> 00:29:35.244
<v Speaker 2>I've seen this work for the most extreme</v>
<v Speaker 2>forms of panic disorder and the drugs </v>

637
00:29:38.611 --> 00:29:39.444
<v Speaker 2>that we use for anxiety or the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The benzodiazepines are highly </v>

638
00:29:42.431 --> 00:29:44.080
<v Speaker 2>addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mess with your mind.</v>

639
00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:45.183
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a good friend who has an issue </v>

640
00:29:47.351 --> 00:29:51.100
<v Speaker 2>with anxiety medication and he takes it </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the time and when he does take it,</v>

641
00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:53.890
<v Speaker 2>apparently it has that rebound effect.</v>

642
00:29:53.890 --> 00:29:56.710
<v Speaker 2>Exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He gets horribly anxious.</v>

643
00:29:56.740 --> 00:29:57.573
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are handed out like candy and </v>

644
00:29:58.571 --> 00:30:00.850
<v Speaker 2>nobody warns people how addictive they </v>
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>

645
00:30:00.851 --> 00:30:03.580
<v Speaker 2>It's a worse addiction than an opiate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Addiction.</v>

646
00:30:03.810 --> 00:30:07.450
<v Speaker 2>It xanax real well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did not know that.</v>

647
00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:10.090
<v Speaker 2>Harder to get off of opioids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

648
00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:11.523
<v Speaker 2>Now how do you feel about psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 2>interventions when it comes to </v>

649
00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:17.423
<v Speaker 2>addiction?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it seems that we're hearing </v>

650
00:30:19.061 --> 00:30:19.894
<v Speaker 2>more and more about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you have a background in that as </v>

651
00:30:21.551 --> 00:30:22.290
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

652
00:30:22.290 --> 00:30:25.110
<v Speaker 2>we're especially hearing about the Boga </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Ibogaine.</v>

653
00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:29.900
<v Speaker 2>This is the African a psychedelic and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there are clinics and people using this.</v>

654
00:30:29.901 --> 00:30:32.170
<v Speaker 2>The claim great success.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have firsthand experience.</v>

655
00:30:32.171 --> 00:30:34.540
<v Speaker 2>I only know what I've heard and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've talked to people,</v>

656
00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:40.120
<v Speaker 2>but sounds good and I think that most of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the psychedelics are so nontoxic,</v>

657
00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:41.553
<v Speaker 2>so safe and in the right hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's many possibilities for </v>

658
00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:46.143
<v Speaker 2>good outcomes.</v>

659
00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:47.223
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've also had some pretty good </v>

660
00:30:47.861 --> 00:30:50.620
<v Speaker 2>results with cigarette cessation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

661
00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:53.410
<v Speaker 2>With not just a Bogo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even with psilocybin.</v>

662
00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:55.150
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apparently they had,</v>

663
00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:56.763
<v Speaker 2>they did a study where they show the </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference between someone taking </v>

664
00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:00.633
<v Speaker 2>psilocybin to try to quit smoking </v>
<v Speaker 2>cigarettes and some really large number </v>

665
00:31:05.861 --> 00:31:06.694
<v Speaker 2>of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was the neighborhood of 80 </v>

666
00:31:07.721 --> 00:31:08.554
<v Speaker 2>percent quit and then over the course of</v>
<v Speaker 2>x amount of years they were still at 60 </v>

667
00:31:12.521 --> 00:31:14.560
<v Speaker 2>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So only 20 percent of those people would</v>

668
00:31:14.561 --> 00:31:15.430
<v Speaker 2>come back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>

669
00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:20.410
<v Speaker 2>But with other methods that the number </v>
<v Speaker 2>was much smaller,</v>

670
00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:23.860
<v Speaker 2>somewhere in the range of 20 or 15 </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent after six years,</v>

671
00:31:23.861 --> 00:31:24.694
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them just went back to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you make of the microdosing </v>

672
00:31:27.071 --> 00:31:27.761
<v Speaker 2>phenomenon?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

673
00:31:27.761 --> 00:31:28.594
<v Speaker 2>this is pretty astounding to see this </v>
<v Speaker 2>actual pussies you scared to jump all </v>

674
00:31:30.941 --> 00:31:34.540
<v Speaker 2>the way and get it all into one thing.</v>

675
00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:38.350
<v Speaker 2>Scary man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why you want to medicate every day?</v>

676
00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:41.250
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of how I feel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

677
00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:42.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm just joking around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

678
00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:43.330
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

679
00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:44.273
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know people who have experienced some </v>

680
00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:46.533
<v Speaker 2>pretty severe benefits of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially people that weren't doing so </v>

681
00:31:49.391 --> 00:31:50.224
<v Speaker 2>good health wise and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just really kind of feeling down </v>

682
00:31:53.081 --> 00:31:56.050
<v Speaker 2>and depressed and all of a sudden </v>
<v Speaker 2>outlook radically changed.</v>

683
00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:57.153
<v Speaker 2>Particularly psilocybin microdosing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot of people who are doing </v>

684
00:31:59.351 --> 00:31:59.820
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

685
00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:03.160
<v Speaker 2>same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a lot of hope that Oregon becomes</v>

686
00:32:03.161 --> 00:32:03.994
<v Speaker 2>the first state to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sounds like it's close to legalize </v>

687
00:32:06.521 --> 00:32:07.271
<v Speaker 2>suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been,</v>

688
00:32:07.271 --> 00:32:09.190
<v Speaker 2>that'd be a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be gigantic.</v>

689
00:32:09.191 --> 00:32:10.024
<v Speaker 2>And I think once we realized that no </v>
<v Speaker 2>one's dying and a lot of people are </v>

690
00:32:12.311 --> 00:32:13.144
<v Speaker 2>getting helped and a lot of people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are terminal are having some really </v>

691
00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:18.513
<v Speaker 2>amazing alleviation of anxiety and an </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding that it's going to be </v>

692
00:32:22.361 --> 00:32:24.070
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And just,</v>

693
00:32:24.071 --> 00:32:27.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think between friends and just the,</v>

694
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:28.833
<v Speaker 2>just the camaraderie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it sort of when you have these group </v>

695
00:32:34.121 --> 00:32:37.780
<v Speaker 2>experiences together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's some incredible benefits to</v>

696
00:32:37.781 --> 00:32:39.800
<v Speaker 2>that in terms of reinforcing</v>

697
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:43.250
<v Speaker 1>community and civilization the way we </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel about each other.</v>

698
00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:44.143
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aside from the psychological and </v>

699
00:32:44.961 --> 00:32:45.794
<v Speaker 1>emotional benefits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you would be fascinated by some </v>

700
00:32:47.481 --> 00:32:48.314
<v Speaker 1>of the things that I've observed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>written about of real physical benefits </v>

701
00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:54.290
<v Speaker 1>of psychedelics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll just tell you a couple.</v>

702
00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:55.930
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

703
00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:59.240
<v Speaker 1>when I was in my late twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a lot of experiments,</v>

704
00:32:59.241 --> 00:33:02.690
<v Speaker 1>was in the seventies with lsd mostly </v>
<v Speaker 1>with lsd.</v>

705
00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:05.660
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a lifelong allergy to cats.</v>

706
00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:07.730
<v Speaker 1>If a cat got near me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my eyes would itch,</v>

707
00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:09.950
<v Speaker 1>my nose would run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If a cat licked me,</v>

708
00:33:09.951 --> 00:33:10.784
<v Speaker 1>I'd get highs were looking at me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I always avoided them and didn't let </v>

709
00:33:13.251 --> 00:33:16.220
<v Speaker 1>him touch me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I took lsd with a group of friends on</v>

710
00:33:16.221 --> 00:33:18.650
<v Speaker 1>a Spring Day because we get Virginia </v>
<v Speaker 1>fabulous,</v>

711
00:33:18.651 --> 00:33:19.484
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was outside running around having a </v>

712
00:33:20.661 --> 00:33:22.640
<v Speaker 1>lot of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in the middle of this the cat jumped</v>

713
00:33:22.641 --> 00:33:26.240
<v Speaker 1>into my lap and I had a moment of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to defend myself.</v>

714
00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:27.440
<v Speaker 1>And then I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is silly,</v>

715
00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:29.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I relaxed,</v>

716
00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:30.733
<v Speaker 1>played with the cat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had no allergic reaction and never did </v>

717
00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:38.230
<v Speaker 1>ever after the disappearance of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>allergy that had been there all my life.</v>

718
00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:39.463
<v Speaker 1>What would it be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The physiological mechanism for some </v>

719
00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:41.700
<v Speaker 1>time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

720
00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:44.930
<v Speaker 1>then clearly that's a very profound mind</v>
<v Speaker 1>body interaction.</v>

721
00:33:44.931 --> 00:33:45.764
<v Speaker 1>Now we know that allergies are </v>
<v Speaker 1>influenced by that because you can show </v>

722
00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:51.500
<v Speaker 1>a personal allergic to roses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a plastic rose,</v>

723
00:33:51.501 --> 00:33:52.620
<v Speaker 1>and they'll have an allergy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

724
00:33:52.890 --> 00:33:56.210
<v Speaker 1>So there's a learned component to </v>
<v Speaker 1>allergy that can be unlearned,</v>

725
00:33:56.211 --> 00:33:57.500
<v Speaker 1>but have an instant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

726
00:33:57.530 --> 00:33:58.341
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

727
00:33:58.341 --> 00:34:00.080
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is even more dramatic.</v>

728
00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:02.690
<v Speaker 1>Maybe a year later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>

729
00:34:02.691 --> 00:34:03.524
<v Speaker 1>It was LSD in the spring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had also grown up with very fair skin </v>

730
00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:10.280
<v Speaker 1>and was told I couldn't get tan and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>used to go down to the Jersey shore.</v>

731
00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:13.250
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember innumerable times,</v>

732
00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:14.113
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets getting second degree burns sheets </v>

733
00:34:15.531 --> 00:34:17.780
<v Speaker 1>of skin peeling off knock Zima at night.</v>

734
00:34:17.970 --> 00:34:19.760
<v Speaker 1>We didn't have sunscreen in those days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

735
00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:20.751
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

736
00:34:20.751 --> 00:34:22.040
<v Speaker 1>I just accepted that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was,</v>

737
00:34:22.041 --> 00:34:23.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't get 10.</v>

738
00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:25.370
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high on LSD,</v>

739
00:34:25.850 --> 00:34:26.683
<v Speaker 1>lying out naked in my great woods in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>home in Virginia and the sun was up </v>

740
00:34:32.721 --> 00:34:35.930
<v Speaker 1>there and I thought this is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

741
00:34:35.931 --> 00:34:36.764
<v Speaker 1>I should not be afraid of the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next day I got Tan and I have ever </v>

742
00:34:39.381 --> 00:34:41.360
<v Speaker 1>since,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's a little more,</v>

743
00:34:41.450 --> 00:34:43.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm not quite sure of the mechanism </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

744
00:34:43.521 --> 00:34:45.740
<v Speaker 1>but it's pretty long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were you outside for though?</v>

745
00:34:45.770 --> 00:34:49.970
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're going to get burned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was out in good time.</v>

746
00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:50.660
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't,</v>

747
00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:52.110
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't have normally have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

748
00:34:52.111 --> 00:34:53.250
<v Speaker 1>at least I would have had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

749
00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:56.360
<v Speaker 1>my usual reaction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then my skin got tan it never had in</v>

750
00:34:56.361 --> 00:34:57.194
<v Speaker 1>my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what are you suggesting happened </v>

751
00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:00.980
<v Speaker 1>again?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

752
00:35:00.981 --> 00:35:05.180
<v Speaker 1>there must be a way in which the nervous</v>
<v Speaker 1>system influences melana sites,</v>

753
00:35:05.181 --> 00:35:06.340
<v Speaker 1>which are the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cell,</v>

754
00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:07.253
<v Speaker 1>the pigment cells in the body that can </v>
<v Speaker 1>either extend their projections with </v>

755
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:12.583
<v Speaker 1>pigment granules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the nervous system controls that in </v>

756
00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:15.493
<v Speaker 1>the mind connects the nervous system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what about someone who's like </v>

757
00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:17.863
<v Speaker 1>ridiculously fair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what about someone who lives in </v>

758
00:35:19.251 --> 00:35:20.084
<v Speaker 1>Scotland?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I would do is when Dr Weil's </v>

759
00:35:22.941 --> 00:35:26.080
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic clinic opens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have an open,</v>

760
00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:28.430
<v Speaker 1>well we'll see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there'll be an allergy program,</v>

761
00:35:28.431 --> 00:35:30.320
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd go in on the first day,</v>

762
00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:35.570
<v Speaker 1>you take a full dose of something and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're exposed to the allergen and magic</v>

763
00:35:35.571 --> 00:35:36.404
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you come in for 10 sessions </v>

764
00:35:37.770 --> 00:35:38.040
<v Speaker 1>with a</v>

765
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:40.980
<v Speaker 2>decreasing those and at some point </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not getting,</v>

766
00:35:40.981 --> 00:35:42.930
<v Speaker 2>you're just getting a placebo and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know when that is.</v>

767
00:35:42.931 --> 00:35:44.970
<v Speaker 2>And people are trained to lose their </v>
<v Speaker 2>allergies.</v>

768
00:35:44.971 --> 00:35:47.150
<v Speaker 2>I think you can do the same thing with </v>
<v Speaker 2>suntanning.</v>

769
00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:51.780
<v Speaker 2>Maybe not with people from Scotland </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they've got fewer pigment cells,</v>

770
00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:53.173
<v Speaker 2>but I wouldn't rule it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you one more also from this </v>

771
00:35:56.221 --> 00:35:58.770
<v Speaker 2>period I told you I was playing with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Yoga.</v>

772
00:35:58.771 --> 00:35:59.604
<v Speaker 2>There was one posture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't do the plow where you lie on </v>

773
00:36:02.311 --> 00:36:04.740
<v Speaker 2>your back and try to touch your toes </v>
<v Speaker 2>behind your head.</v>

774
00:36:05.370 --> 00:36:06.203
<v Speaker 2>I got to where I could get my toes to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>foot from the floor and I had </v>

775
00:36:08.731 --> 00:36:12.390
<v Speaker 2>excruciating pain in my neck and I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As much as I tried that,</v>

776
00:36:12.391 --> 00:36:14.970
<v Speaker 2>I made no progress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was on the verge of giving up.</v>

777
00:36:14.971 --> 00:36:16.650
<v Speaker 2>I thought I was too old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was 28.</v>

778
00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:19.740
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when in an LSD state,</v>

779
00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:22.140
<v Speaker 2>my body was feeling totally elastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

780
00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:23.040
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll try that.</v>

781
00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:24.143
<v Speaker 2>So I'm lowering my feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought I had a foot to go and they </v>

782
00:36:26.731 --> 00:36:28.200
<v Speaker 2>touch the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't believe it.</v>

783
00:36:28.201 --> 00:36:29.970
<v Speaker 2>I was raised it lowered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

784
00:36:29.971 --> 00:36:32.190
<v Speaker 2>Fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The next day I tried to do it.</v>

785
00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:35.580
<v Speaker 2>I got within a foot of the ground and </v>
<v Speaker 2>had excruciating pain in my neck,</v>

786
00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:39.450
<v Speaker 2>but now I knew it was possible before </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I didn't know was possible,</v>

787
00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:40.553
<v Speaker 2>so knowing it was possible I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivated to keep at it and then a few </v>

788
00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:45.900
<v Speaker 2>weeks I was able to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I had not had that experience,</v>

789
00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:47.213
<v Speaker 2>I would've given.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think this is the magic of these </v>

790
00:36:49.111 --> 00:36:51.240
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can show you possibilities.</v>

791
00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:54.360
<v Speaker 2>They don't necessarily teach you how to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to maintain them,</v>

792
00:36:54.361 --> 00:36:56.250
<v Speaker 2>but they can show you the things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>

793
00:36:56.250 --> 00:36:57.083
<v Speaker 2>You'd never believe what didn't even </v>
<v Speaker 2>seem like it was just showing you a </v>

794
00:36:58.831 --> 00:37:01.530
<v Speaker 2>possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was actually showing a capability.</v>

795
00:37:01.770 --> 00:37:02.603
<v Speaker 2>You are capable of moving in a way that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't think you were before and it </v>

796
00:37:05.521 --> 00:37:08.660
<v Speaker 2>was because of your own tension and </v>
<v Speaker 2>worry.</v>

797
00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:09.653
<v Speaker 2>Probably learned patterns of tension </v>
<v Speaker 2>that had built up all my life and maybe </v>

798
00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:16.860
<v Speaker 2>some because of the conscious or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic state rather.</v>

799
00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:20.070
<v Speaker 2>There's some alleviation of tension.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My mind was out of the way.</v>

800
00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:22.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hm.</v>

801
00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:23.993
<v Speaker 2>Well you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you definitely sense that with </v>

802
00:37:25.381 --> 00:37:27.510
<v Speaker 2>marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly edible marijuana,</v>

803
00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:31.140
<v Speaker 2>you can really get good stretching in </v>
<v Speaker 2>with edible marijuana.</v>

804
00:37:31.141 --> 00:37:33.210
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

805
00:37:33.211 --> 00:37:34.044
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate to use certain terms to just </v>

806
00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:38.930
<v Speaker 2>trigger people's bullshit alarms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a,</v>

807
00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:43.770
<v Speaker 2>you can see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can feel more of the muscle,</v>

808
00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:46.140
<v Speaker 2>you can see more of what's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it's doing,</v>

809
00:37:46.170 --> 00:37:47.100
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas,</v>

810
00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:49.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

811
00:37:49.161 --> 00:37:53.640
<v Speaker 2>I've been involved in martial arts and </v>
<v Speaker 2>athletics growing up my life,</v>

812
00:37:53.641 --> 00:37:58.110
<v Speaker 2>so I have a good awareness of my body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's way better when I,</v>

813
00:37:58.280 --> 00:37:58.920
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>metal,</v>

814
00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:00.150
<v Speaker 2>edible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>edible marijuana.</v>

815
00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:01.343
<v Speaker 2>Like I feel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand like I can practice moves </v>

816
00:38:04.291 --> 00:38:05.170
<v Speaker 2>better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like certain,</v>

817
00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:06.013
<v Speaker 2>like kicking techniques.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm better if I'm more in tune with how </v>

818
00:38:09.961 --> 00:38:10.794
<v Speaker 2>everything's working together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas sometimes I can do it if I'm </v>

819
00:38:14.101 --> 00:38:15.240
<v Speaker 2>sober,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

820
00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:19.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm almost like there's a prophylactic </v>
<v Speaker 2>between me and my body.</v>

821
00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:23.460
<v Speaker 2>There's a number next to it that gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>removed by edible marijuana.</v>

822
00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:26.210
<v Speaker 2>One other I'm fascinated by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was with MDM,</v>

823
00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:27.270
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

824
00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:30.420
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lived in a ranch outside of Tucson and</v>

825
00:38:30.421 --> 00:38:35.421
<v Speaker 2>I had pathways that had a sort of large </v>
<v Speaker 2>gravel and I could not walk on</v>

826
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:38.490
<v Speaker 1>that barefoot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really hurt my feet and if,</v>

827
00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:39.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I stood in them,</v>

828
00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:43.170
<v Speaker 1>you could see Denson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my feet on Mtma.</v>

829
00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:45.250
<v Speaker 1>I was able to like dance on those </v>
<v Speaker 1>stones,</v>

830
00:38:45.251 --> 00:38:46.084
<v Speaker 1>no pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the interesting thing is there were </v>

831
00:38:47.681 --> 00:38:48.514
<v Speaker 1>no marks on my feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the pain is easy to figure out how </v>

832
00:38:51.401 --> 00:38:53.210
<v Speaker 1>that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what's happening that you know,</v>

833
00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:54.760
<v Speaker 1>you don't get a dent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

834
00:38:54.761 --> 00:38:58.540
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me if your mind is out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way,</v>

835
00:38:58.570 --> 00:38:59.403
<v Speaker 1>maybe little muscles there can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are free to press back with just the </v>

836
00:39:02.711 --> 00:39:05.350
<v Speaker 1>amount of force to neutralize the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pressure.</v>

837
00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:08.380
<v Speaker 1>It's like if your mind is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>interfering,</v>

838
00:39:08.381 --> 00:39:10.750
<v Speaker 1>I think the body has amazing </v>
<v Speaker 1>capabilities.</v>

839
00:39:11.050 --> 00:39:11.883
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I definitely think you can mind fuck </v>

840
00:39:12.641 --> 00:39:13.280
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

841
00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:14.620
<v Speaker 1>And you can definitely think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

842
00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:15.670
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is.</v>

843
00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:17.740
<v Speaker 1>You can start thinking it's worse than </v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

844
00:39:17.741 --> 00:39:19.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you can relax a lot,</v>

845
00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:20.733
<v Speaker 1>oftentimes there's many situations where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you relax and things aren't nearly as </v>

846
00:39:23.231 --> 00:39:25.780
<v Speaker 1>bad as you are making them out to be.</v>

847
00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:27.693
<v Speaker 1>So that could be some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm with you on everything except the </v>

848
00:39:30.341 --> 00:39:32.110
<v Speaker 1>tanning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tanning.</v>

849
00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:34.053
<v Speaker 1>I experienced it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of those things like big </v>

850
00:39:35.361 --> 00:39:36.194
<v Speaker 1>foot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when you should just keep it to </v>

851
00:39:36.821 --> 00:39:38.580
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you see the clip,</v>

852
00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:41.380
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to just go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to explain it.</v>

853
00:39:41.381 --> 00:39:42.214
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to keep that to myself </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I know when people tell me </v>

854
00:39:44.981 --> 00:39:45.814
<v Speaker 1>things that I have no experience of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm always willing to entertain the </v>

855
00:39:50.141 --> 00:39:50.974
<v Speaker 1>possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then I got to experience it for </v>

856
00:39:52.391 --> 00:39:53.224
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm willing to entertain it dependent </v>

857
00:39:54.731 --> 00:39:55.990
<v Speaker 1>upon who I'm talking to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

858
00:39:56.110 --> 00:39:56.943
<v Speaker 1>Because there's some Kooky people out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and you will entertain the </v>

859
00:39:59.121 --> 00:40:02.510
<v Speaker 1>possibility after possibilities until </v>
<v Speaker 1>you die.</v>

860
00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:05.050
<v Speaker 1>You realize you have one big Dr Seuss </v>
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>

861
00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:08.480
<v Speaker 1>Some people are just crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

862
00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:09.910
<v Speaker 1>we have to accept that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>

863
00:40:09.930 --> 00:40:11.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt about it.</v>

864
00:40:11.411 --> 00:40:12.244
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am absolutely aware that there's some </v>

865
00:40:14.261 --> 00:40:15.094
<v Speaker 1>component.</v>

866
00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:16.023
<v Speaker 1>There's something about the mind and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way the mind interacts with matter and </v>

867
00:40:19.031 --> 00:40:23.860
<v Speaker 1>with life that has a profound effect on </v>
<v Speaker 1>your body and it would be really nice if</v>

868
00:40:23.861 --> 00:40:24.694
<v Speaker 1>we were all better at controlling that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the insights that I've had in </v>

869
00:40:29.951 --> 00:40:33.790
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic states is that everything is</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious.</v>

870
00:40:33.791 --> 00:40:36.570
<v Speaker 1>That consciousness permeates everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you know,</v>

871
00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:40.300
<v Speaker 1>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel whatever in me,</v>

872
00:40:40.301 --> 00:40:44.320
<v Speaker 1>that my consciousness is also in rocks </v>
<v Speaker 1>and in plants and animals,</v>

873
00:40:44.321 --> 00:40:48.430
<v Speaker 1>that there are some universal something </v>
<v Speaker 1>out there and it's.</v>

874
00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:53.230
<v Speaker 1>There are two really different ways of </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at reality.</v>

875
00:40:53.530 --> 00:40:54.363
<v Speaker 1>One is the materialist one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the consciousness is a product </v>

876
00:40:57.131 --> 00:41:01.000
<v Speaker 1>of brain biochemistry and electricity </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that is dominant in science today.</v>

877
00:41:01.390 --> 00:41:02.223
<v Speaker 1>The other is that the brain is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>receiving apparatus for consciousness </v>

878
00:41:05.591 --> 00:41:09.850
<v Speaker 1>and that consciousness is primary maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>existed before matter,</v>

879
00:41:09.870 --> 00:41:10.703
<v Speaker 1>maybe organized matter into forms that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are more and we're able to experience </v>

880
00:41:15.281 --> 00:41:16.480
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

881
00:41:16.481 --> 00:41:18.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's a way to prove one</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the other.</v>

882
00:41:18.371 --> 00:41:22.330
<v Speaker 1>It's just that for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the conscious is the primary one is more</v>

883
00:41:22.331 --> 00:41:23.164
<v Speaker 1>fun and makes life more interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you're familiar with rupert </v>

884
00:41:26.171 --> 00:41:27.040
<v Speaker 1>sheldrick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

885
00:41:27.041 --> 00:41:28.690
<v Speaker 1>He's good friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>

886
00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:29.733
<v Speaker 1>very interesting guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has an idea that everything has </v>

887
00:41:31.691 --> 00:41:34.170
<v Speaker 1>memory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He believes that that</v>

888
00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:35.473
<v Speaker 2>bill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this would be like the reason I guess </v>

889
00:41:37.431 --> 00:41:39.830
<v Speaker 2>why some people would not want to live </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a haunted house.</v>

890
00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:40.863
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would think that if someone was </v>

891
00:41:41.421 --> 00:41:42.254
<v Speaker 2>murdered in the house that it would </v>
<v Speaker 2>retain some memory of these atrocities </v>

892
00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:47.053
<v Speaker 2>and that you would somehow or another </v>
<v Speaker 2>interact with that if you were in that </v>

893
00:41:49.211 --> 00:41:50.044
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like spaces like my dad is not a </v>

894
00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:57.140
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not a woo kind of guy,</v>

895
00:41:57.530 --> 00:41:58.363
<v Speaker 2>but he went to Gettysburg and he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>telling me that when he was at </v>

896
00:42:00.861 --> 00:42:03.770
<v Speaker 2>Gettysburg that it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he felt profound sadness.</v>

897
00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:05.013
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just seems like it's just in the </v>

898
00:42:06.651 --> 00:42:08.510
<v Speaker 2>ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the whole area.</v>

899
00:42:08.511 --> 00:42:10.460
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how to describe it,</v>

900
00:42:10.461 --> 00:42:11.900
<v Speaker 2>but I wanted to get the fuck out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

901
00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:13.003
<v Speaker 2>Like just just being around this era </v>
<v Speaker 2>where this battle had taken place on so </v>

902
00:42:16.401 --> 00:42:17.360
<v Speaker 2>many people that died.</v>

903
00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:18.770
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could feel it,</v>

904
00:42:19.230 --> 00:42:19.950
<v Speaker 2>huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

905
00:42:19.950 --> 00:42:21.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

906
00:42:21.250 --> 00:42:23.420
<v Speaker 2>but he's not the Kinda guy that know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

907
00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:27.560
<v Speaker 2>But that's an example where somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>tells you something that is experienced.</v>

908
00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:30.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm willing to entertain it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to experience it myself,</v>

909
00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:32.030
<v Speaker 2>but it also could be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

910
00:42:32.031 --> 00:42:32.864
<v Speaker 2>like he um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got lucky and didn't get drafted </v>

911
00:42:36.291 --> 00:42:41.270
<v Speaker 2>during Vietnam and that's probably in </v>
<v Speaker 2>his head that if he did get drafted,</v>

912
00:42:41.271 --> 00:42:42.104
<v Speaker 2>he might've died over there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for what reason he wouldn't have </v>

913
00:42:44.841 --> 00:42:47.750
<v Speaker 2>experienced this life know why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the.</v>

914
00:42:47.890 --> 00:42:48.723
<v Speaker 2>And then thinking about these young men </v>
<v Speaker 2>that died in the same fashion for some </v>

915
00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:55.010
<v Speaker 2>war that didn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like why the fuck are they even fighting</v>

916
00:42:55.011 --> 00:42:55.600
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like who,</v>

917
00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:56.530
<v Speaker 2>whose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why,</v>

918
00:42:56.570 --> 00:42:57.403
<v Speaker 2>why is this a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then having all these people die </v>

919
00:42:59.481 --> 00:43:03.080
<v Speaker 2>together in this one horrible battle in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this one place.</v>

920
00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:05.750
<v Speaker 2>And he could have been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was playing a game on his mind.</v>

921
00:43:05.751 --> 00:43:06.584
<v Speaker 2>But now joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to talk to you about your </v>

922
00:43:08.451 --> 00:43:10.940
<v Speaker 2>language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why the fuck do you swear so much?</v>

923
00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:13.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you read anything about the science</v>

924
00:43:13.011 --> 00:43:14.100
<v Speaker 2>of swearing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

925
00:43:14.210 --> 00:43:16.010
<v Speaker 2>Do you know that there is a science of </v>
<v Speaker 2>swearing?</v>

926
00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:16.940
<v Speaker 2>Escience?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

927
00:43:16.941 --> 00:43:18.620
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty interesting stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

928
00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:23.680
<v Speaker 2>so the part of your brain that produces </v>
<v Speaker 2>swear words is not the part of the brain</v>

929
00:43:24.590 --> 00:43:28.550
<v Speaker 2>that manages ordinary language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really interesting.</v>

930
00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:29.541
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

931
00:43:29.541 --> 00:43:32.750
<v Speaker 2>we have two language centers and our </v>
<v Speaker 2>left frontal Cortex,</v>

932
00:43:33.350 --> 00:43:34.183
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that have strokes that damage </v>

933
00:43:36.211 --> 00:43:39.650
<v Speaker 2>them often lose language completely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they can still swear.</v>

934
00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:42.710
<v Speaker 2>So swearing is coming from somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>

935
00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:45.560
<v Speaker 2>It may be coming from the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>hemisphere,</v>

936
00:43:45.890 --> 00:43:46.723
<v Speaker 2>but it's also coming from deeper centers</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the brain that connect to the limbic </v>

937
00:43:49.851 --> 00:43:51.470
<v Speaker 2>system and the Amygdala.</v>

938
00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:54.560
<v Speaker 2>And that connects to the involuntary </v>
<v Speaker 2>nervous system.</v>

939
00:43:54.561 --> 00:43:59.150
<v Speaker 2>So here's a couple of interesting facts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Swearing is associated with sweating,</v>

940
00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:00.013
<v Speaker 2>increased sweating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you should be dripping with sweat </v>

941
00:44:02.890 --> 00:44:06.890
<v Speaker 2>that much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a comedian also.</v>

942
00:44:06.891 --> 00:44:07.724
<v Speaker 2>Interesting swearing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a increases pain tolerance and there's </v>

943
00:44:11.751 --> 00:44:12.584
<v Speaker 2>an interesting experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know the standard way they do paint </v>

944
00:44:14.321 --> 00:44:15.154
<v Speaker 2>colors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have people stick their hand in a </v>

945
00:44:16.041 --> 00:44:19.790
<v Speaker 2>bucket of ice and water and you see how </v>
<v Speaker 2>long they can keep it there.</v>

946
00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:24.650
<v Speaker 2>That people who say fuck shit can keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>it there much longer than people who are</v>

947
00:44:24.651 --> 00:44:27.260
<v Speaker 2>not allowed to swear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about noises?</v>

948
00:44:27.261 --> 00:44:30.100
<v Speaker 2>What if they just go?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

949
00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:33.740
<v Speaker 2>it was swearing specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they've tried noises and swearing and</v>

950
00:44:33.741 --> 00:44:35.130
<v Speaker 2>so it may be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know when you,</v>

951
00:44:35.570 --> 00:44:37.380
<v Speaker 2>if you're hammering a nail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hit your thumb.</v>

952
00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:39.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you use one of those words.</v>

953
00:44:39.571 --> 00:44:40.404
<v Speaker 2>That's a good strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting because I almost </v>

954
00:44:42.001 --> 00:44:42.780
<v Speaker 2>always do that.</v>

955
00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:43.613
<v Speaker 2>If I heard something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially a finger slammed a car door </v>

956
00:44:46.321 --> 00:44:47.520
<v Speaker 2>the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to.</v>

957
00:44:49.010 --> 00:44:50.250
<v Speaker 2>So that's what that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's.</v>

958
00:44:50.251 --> 00:44:51.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's interesting.</v>

959
00:44:51.190 --> 00:44:52.023
<v Speaker 2>It's coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a different part of the brain </v>

960
00:44:53.371 --> 00:44:56.520
<v Speaker 2>that that manages that has different </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotional content.</v>

961
00:44:56.940 --> 00:44:58.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It flavors language.</v>

962
00:44:58.560 --> 00:44:59.810
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I live them.</v>

963
00:45:00.090 --> 00:45:02.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big fan of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas I'll leave you some papers about</v>

964
00:45:02.881 --> 00:45:04.540
<v Speaker 2>the science of swearing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting.</v>

965
00:45:04.630 --> 00:45:08.340
<v Speaker 2>It's very interesting now what it will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would happen if they were no longer</v>

966
00:45:08.341 --> 00:45:12.210
<v Speaker 2>taboo with the St Louis area?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they lose their power.</v>

967
00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:13.393
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

968
00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:15.500
<v Speaker 2>The same areas of the brain wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>

969
00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:19.380
<v Speaker 2>I remember there was an episode of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember what television show,</v>

970
00:45:19.381 --> 00:45:24.381
<v Speaker 2>but it was on cbs and they had a line at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the end of the show and essentially they</v>

971
00:45:25.831 --> 00:45:28.800
<v Speaker 2>were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit happens and it was a big deal.</v>

972
00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:29.673
<v Speaker 2>I'll bet it was a big deal that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to be able to say shit happened </v>

973
00:45:32.490 --> 00:45:33.323
<v Speaker 2>and apparently they pulled this off and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they got it through and it was like a </v>

974
00:45:35.701 --> 00:45:36.511
<v Speaker 2>10:00</v>
<v Speaker 2>PM show,</v>

975
00:45:36.511 --> 00:45:39.060
<v Speaker 2>so it was okay and it was 11:00</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the time they said Shit.</v>

976
00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:41.340
<v Speaker 2>And I remember thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

977
00:45:41.341 --> 00:45:42.174
<v Speaker 2>what a strange sort of like how many </v>
<v Speaker 2>people were involved in this sort of </v>

978
00:45:45.810 --> 00:45:49.770
<v Speaker 2>dance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how many lawyers and executives and</v>

979
00:45:49.771 --> 00:45:51.500
<v Speaker 2>who.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very strange,</v>

980
00:45:51.501 --> 00:45:54.990
<v Speaker 2>very strange that this one word would </v>
<v Speaker 2>treat everybody knows the word.</v>

981
00:45:55.410 --> 00:45:58.650
<v Speaker 2>It's not even that kind of game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all,</v>

982
00:45:59.090 --> 00:46:00.540
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so,</v>

983
00:46:00.541 --> 00:46:01.374
<v Speaker 2>but you're saying this game is </v>
<v Speaker 2>facilitated by one specific part of the </v>

984
00:46:04.771 --> 00:46:08.630
<v Speaker 2>brain and so that because like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

985
00:46:08.850 --> 00:46:09.683
<v Speaker 2>words are taboo words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>taboo words and often associated with </v>

986
00:46:12.541 --> 00:46:17.400
<v Speaker 2>things that we find offensive or with </v>
<v Speaker 2>bodily acts that freak people out.</v>

987
00:46:17.790 --> 00:46:19.050
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so there's both,</v>

988
00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:21.570
<v Speaker 2>there's a psychological social aspect to</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

989
00:46:21.571 --> 00:46:23.490
<v Speaker 2>but there's also a neurological aspect </v>
<v Speaker 2>to it.</v>

990
00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:28.230
<v Speaker 2>Now when the words like some some words </v>
<v Speaker 2>for some people,</v>

991
00:46:28.231 --> 00:46:29.064
<v Speaker 2>like I remember when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lived in Florida for a little bit and </v>

992
00:46:32.550 --> 00:46:37.550
<v Speaker 2>I said Hell once and in Florida in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>19 seventies.</v>

993
00:46:37.650 --> 00:46:39.830
<v Speaker 2>Hell was a swear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

994
00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:41.580
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

995
00:46:41.581 --> 00:46:42.414
<v Speaker 2>I mean I came from New Jersey and then I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was in San Francisco and then also in </v>

996
00:46:45.901 --> 00:46:47.640
<v Speaker 2>Florida and I said Hell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>

997
00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:49.320
<v Speaker 2>don't swear like that in this class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

998
00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:52.450
<v Speaker 2>where the fuck are you people talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about?</v>

999
00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:54.450
<v Speaker 2>Like it didn't make any sense to me and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I was like,</v>

1000
00:46:54.451 --> 00:46:55.284
<v Speaker 2>you guys have different swears now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you had a word that was not taboo to </v>

1001
00:47:00.331 --> 00:47:02.580
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would it be,</v>

1002
00:47:03.090 --> 00:47:07.080
<v Speaker 2>would that same area of your brain?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know this is,</v>

1003
00:47:07.490 --> 00:47:10.830
<v Speaker 2>there has not been a lot of research but</v>
<v Speaker 2>it hasn't been taken seriously,</v>

1004
00:47:10.831 --> 00:47:14.700
<v Speaker 2>but that's all interesting questions I </v>
<v Speaker 2>should have studied because some.</v>

1005
00:47:14.701 --> 00:47:17.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you're a really super </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative person,</v>

1006
00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:19.320
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of words that are off the </v>
<v Speaker 2>table.</v>

1007
00:47:19.350 --> 00:47:21.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you are a far more,</v>

1008
00:47:22.510 --> 00:47:25.680
<v Speaker 2>which is loose with your language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could shit this,</v>

1009
00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:27.580
<v Speaker 2>God damn it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1010
00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:29.090
<v Speaker 2>that would be nothing like God damn.</v>

1011
00:47:29.110 --> 00:47:30.760
<v Speaker 2>It would be just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aw shucks.</v>

1012
00:47:30.761 --> 00:47:31.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1013
00:47:32.170 --> 00:47:33.003
<v Speaker 2>But to someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God damn it would be like a really bad </v>

1014
00:47:34.721 --> 00:47:36.460
<v Speaker 2>deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really big deal.</v>

1015
00:47:37.090 --> 00:47:37.923
<v Speaker 2>So what would be different parts of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain would be activated by that versus </v>

1016
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.430
<v Speaker 2>if you said it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be not that big a deal,</v>

1017
00:47:45.431 --> 00:47:48.240
<v Speaker 2>but if someone was like super </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative and they said even more.</v>

1018
00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:49.421
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1019
00:47:49.421 --> 00:47:50.350
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you,</v>

1020
00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:52.450
<v Speaker 2>do you think that that is a universal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1021
00:47:52.451 --> 00:47:54.210
<v Speaker 2>it seems to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seems to be universal.</v>

1022
00:47:54.211 --> 00:47:57.460
<v Speaker 2>It seems to be universal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another finding that came across is that</v>

1023
00:47:57.461 --> 00:48:01.780
<v Speaker 2>people who learn a second language that </v>
<v Speaker 2>swearing in the second language does not</v>

1024
00:48:01.781 --> 00:48:04.510
<v Speaker 2>have the same emotional impact that your</v>
<v Speaker 2>first language.</v>

1025
00:48:04.511 --> 00:48:07.450
<v Speaker 2>Does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why they're so fun when you learn</v>

1026
00:48:07.451 --> 00:48:11.500
<v Speaker 2>Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Swears like you get a free ride.</v>

1027
00:48:11.530 --> 00:48:12.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1028
00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:14.230
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1029
00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:15.453
<v Speaker 2>that makes sense.</v>

1030
00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:17.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can do them on television too,</v>

1031
00:48:18.670 --> 00:48:20.310
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can say a lot of Spanish,</v>

1032
00:48:20.311 --> 00:48:23.680
<v Speaker 2>whereas in English speaking TV and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody just pleads ignorance.</v>

1033
00:48:25.070 --> 00:48:27.760
<v Speaker 2>Do you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So does every language has.</v>

1034
00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:30.390
<v Speaker 2>They all have swears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every language has words,</v>

1035
00:48:30.410 --> 00:48:32.680
<v Speaker 2>swear words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's universal.</v>

1036
00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:36.100
<v Speaker 2>That is really interested in Asian </v>
<v Speaker 2>languages,</v>

1037
00:48:36.101 --> 00:48:37.540
<v Speaker 2>European languages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of them,</v>

1038
00:48:37.541 --> 00:48:39.100
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1039
00:48:39.370 --> 00:48:41.140
<v Speaker 2>Huh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>

1040
00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:44.410
<v Speaker 2>that would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least in my brain,</v>

1041
00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:47.080
<v Speaker 2>seemed to indicate that there's some use</v>
<v Speaker 2>for that.</v>

1042
00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:48.950
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1043
00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:52.600
<v Speaker 2>probably many users.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is this thing of modulating pain.</v>

1044
00:48:52.601 --> 00:48:54.940
<v Speaker 2>What is a social bonding?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1045
00:48:54.941 --> 00:48:56.560
<v Speaker 2>forming some community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1046
00:48:56.561 --> 00:48:59.500
<v Speaker 2>that's how I kind of use it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think when I swear in front of people,</v>

1047
00:48:59.501 --> 00:49:01.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm testing them out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you freaking out.</v>

1048
00:49:01.511 --> 00:49:02.344
<v Speaker 2>If I say fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't talk to you like you too much </v>

1049
00:49:04.841 --> 00:49:05.680
<v Speaker 2>work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1050
00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:07.463
<v Speaker 2>you don't know exactly what if you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking to someone and every other word </v>

1051
00:49:09.791 --> 00:49:11.380
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I really wish you wouldn't use that</v>

1052
00:49:11.381 --> 00:49:14.170
<v Speaker 2>language is there's so much work to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

1053
00:49:14.170 --> 00:49:17.920
<v Speaker 2>I can't hold your hand dance through </v>
<v Speaker 2>this garden.</v>

1054
00:49:18.010 --> 00:49:18.843
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1055
00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:20.140
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1056
00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:25.440
<v Speaker 2>it's to me also like I hang around with </v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people that swear a lot because</v>

1057
00:49:25.961 --> 00:49:30.310
<v Speaker 2>I hang around with professional </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedians and fighters and there's a lot</v>

1058
00:49:30.311 --> 00:49:31.144
<v Speaker 2>of swash swashbuckling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>freewill and type of individuals </v>

1059
00:49:34.931 --> 00:49:35.764
<v Speaker 2>involved in those pursuits and now </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're seeing that there's some study </v>

1060
00:49:39.310 --> 00:49:43.060
<v Speaker 2>suggesting that swearing is becoming </v>
<v Speaker 2>more frequent in our society because,</v>

1061
00:49:44.410 --> 00:49:45.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a trend.</v>

1062
00:49:45.401 --> 00:49:46.234
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure anybody knows why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean somebody would have been on </v>

1063
00:49:49.241 --> 00:49:52.240
<v Speaker 2>the air like you are 20 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

1064
00:49:52.380 --> 00:49:54.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that is specifically because of the</v>

1065
00:49:54.341 --> 00:49:56.110
<v Speaker 2>Internet because there were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1066
00:49:56.210 --> 00:49:57.760
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But even that,</v>

1067
00:49:57.761 --> 00:50:00.130
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's resisted in a lot of ways,</v>

1068
00:50:00.131 --> 00:50:00.964
<v Speaker 2>like people are trying to figure out how</v>
<v Speaker 2>to modulate this and how to handle it </v>

1069
00:50:03.371 --> 00:50:04.440
<v Speaker 2>and they'll never handle it.</v>

1070
00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:06.810
<v Speaker 2>It's like the genie's out of the bottle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1071
00:50:06.811 --> 00:50:07.644
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1072
00:50:08.170 --> 00:50:09.003
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think ultimately you find what you </v>

1073
00:50:10.841 --> 00:50:11.674
<v Speaker 2>enjoy and the best way to find with what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you enjoy is people actually doing what </v>

1074
00:50:14.651 --> 00:50:16.180
<v Speaker 2>they want to do and then you figure it </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

1075
00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:17.400
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1076
00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:19.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that seems to be what's happening in the</v>

1077
00:50:19.571 --> 00:50:21.910
<v Speaker 2>world of the Internet and podcasting and</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that.</v>

1078
00:50:23.140 --> 00:50:26.200
<v Speaker 2>It's also the the access,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1079
00:50:26.201 --> 00:50:27.034
<v Speaker 2>Like a person like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could just put together a podcast </v>

1080
00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:32.540
<v Speaker 2>and if people find it interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it resonates,</v>

1081
00:50:32.810 --> 00:50:36.140
<v Speaker 2>you could get a 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>downloads out of nowhere,</v>

1082
00:50:36.141 --> 00:50:39.020
<v Speaker 2>like 100,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If she have a radio show,</v>

1083
00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:40.340
<v Speaker 2>100,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people listening.</v>

1084
00:50:40.430 --> 00:50:42.950
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot of damn people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they'd be excited and be like,</v>

1085
00:50:42.951 --> 00:50:43.784
<v Speaker 2>Hey Andrew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got the monthly in and you're doing </v>

1086
00:50:45.891 --> 00:50:47.090
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got 100,000</v>

1087
00:50:47.091 --> 00:50:48.140
<v Speaker 2>people a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd be like,</v>

1088
00:50:48.141 --> 00:50:50.840
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a successful business,</v>

1089
00:50:51.140 --> 00:50:53.180
<v Speaker 2>but you could be doing that just from </v>
<v Speaker 2>your office.</v>

1090
00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:54.013
<v Speaker 2>Just put together with a laptop and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>microphone and no distribution </v>

1091
00:50:57.831 --> 00:50:58.664
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever in terms of like no string of</v>
<v Speaker 2>executives and gigantic corporation </v>

1092
00:51:03.141 --> 00:51:03.974
<v Speaker 2>behind you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have nobody telling you what </v>

1093
00:51:05.331 --> 00:51:06.310
<v Speaker 2>you can say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kansas.</v>

1094
00:51:06.430 --> 00:51:07.263
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's one thing you get out of </v>

1095
00:51:08.931 --> 00:51:11.420
<v Speaker 2>today that you never got out of before </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1096
00:51:11.550 --> 00:51:12.383
<v Speaker 2>this is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been involved in show business for </v>

1097
00:51:15.201 --> 00:51:16.034
<v Speaker 2>many years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but only this kind of stuff for nine </v>

1098
00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:23.860
<v Speaker 2>from doing this podcast and what I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>seen with this is like what's unusual.</v>

1099
00:51:23.931 --> 00:51:28.250
<v Speaker 2>I think what resonates with people is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there isn't anybody else.</v>

1100
00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:31.820
<v Speaker 2>There's no group of people that saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Andrew,</v>

1101
00:51:32.230 --> 00:51:33.063
<v Speaker 2>could you stop saying this or let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's concentrate on that and the polls </v>

1102
00:51:36.381 --> 00:51:38.750
<v Speaker 2>are showing that people like this and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1103
00:51:38.790 --> 00:51:42.440
<v Speaker 2>you have breaks in between what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>commercials are playing and they come to</v>

1104
00:51:42.441 --> 00:51:45.020
<v Speaker 2>you with notes and they tell you all </v>
<v Speaker 2>that stuff too.</v>

1105
00:51:45.020 --> 00:51:45.853
<v Speaker 2>Seems to somehow or another ruin this </v>
<v Speaker 2>natural interaction that we have with </v>

1106
00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:50.090
<v Speaker 2>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1107
00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:53.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now for a guy like you,</v>

1108
00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:54.373
<v Speaker 2>the Internet is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would think that with some of your </v>

1109
00:51:56.481 --> 00:51:59.780
<v Speaker 2>more controversial ideas like this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way you could really air them out in</v>

1110
00:51:59.781 --> 00:52:03.620
<v Speaker 2>long form because if you like a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>doctors,</v>

1111
00:52:03.770 --> 00:52:08.720
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to open their mind to </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything outside of what their,</v>

1112
00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:10.510
<v Speaker 2>what their practice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1113
00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:11.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's gonna be rough for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1114
00:52:11.930 --> 00:52:14.990
<v Speaker 2>But I've never censored what I say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always put it all out there.</v>

1115
00:52:15.110 --> 00:52:15.943
<v Speaker 2>Good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1116
00:52:16.070 --> 00:52:18.080
<v Speaker 2>I've done that all my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But do you,</v>

1117
00:52:18.081 --> 00:52:23.000
<v Speaker 2>don't you find that it's more not just </v>
<v Speaker 2>accepted,</v>

1118
00:52:23.001 --> 00:52:26.540
<v Speaker 2>but people are more interested in it now</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of the Internet?</v>

1119
00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:27.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

1120
00:52:27.730 --> 00:52:28.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

1121
00:52:29.330 --> 00:52:31.160
<v Speaker 2>Because I've heard about you for many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many years,</v>

1122
00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:35.630
<v Speaker 2>but it's sort of ramped up over the last</v>
<v Speaker 2>decade or so,</v>

1123
00:52:35.740 --> 00:52:37.760
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1124
00:52:37.790 --> 00:52:38.970
<v Speaker 2>Because of the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1125
00:52:39.090 --> 00:52:40.070
<v Speaker 2>Because people have this,</v>

1126
00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:41.193
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been around.</v>

1127
00:52:41.650 --> 00:52:43.780
<v Speaker 1>It's funny when I look at this stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1128
00:52:43.781 --> 00:52:46.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this stuff about pot and placebos.</v>

1129
00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:49.690
<v Speaker 1>I was saying this stuff in the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 1>seventies,</v>

1130
00:52:49.720 --> 00:52:50.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my first book,</v>

1131
00:52:50.741 --> 00:52:51.574
<v Speaker 1>the natural mind was published in 1972.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It argued that everybody has an innate </v>

1132
00:52:54.941 --> 00:52:57.820
<v Speaker 1>drive to alter their consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1133
00:52:57.821 --> 00:52:59.980
<v Speaker 1>drugs are one way of doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1134
00:52:59.981 --> 00:53:00.814
<v Speaker 1>I did the first human experiments with </v>
<v Speaker 1>pot that we're ever done with a under </v>

1135
00:53:03.970 --> 00:53:06.120
<v Speaker 1>double blonde conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but experiments.</v>

1136
00:53:06.121 --> 00:53:06.954
<v Speaker 1>Did you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gave marijuana to people in a </v>

1137
00:53:08.211 --> 00:53:11.740
<v Speaker 1>laboratory in 1968.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And would you test them for?</v>

1138
00:53:11.890 --> 00:53:12.723
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were just seeing people bet me you </v>

1139
00:53:13.901 --> 00:53:15.880
<v Speaker 1>couldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody had ever done this.</v>

1140
00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:18.280
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the oldest marijuana was becoming such a</v>

1141
00:53:18.281 --> 00:53:20.740
<v Speaker 1>big thing and nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were no experiments.</v>

1142
00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:21.931
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1143
00:53:21.931 --> 00:53:24.970
<v Speaker 1>what kind of experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we took the most basic stuff.</v>

1144
00:53:24.990 --> 00:53:25.823
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to show that you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>give it to the human subjects in a lab </v>

1145
00:53:27.841 --> 00:53:29.310
<v Speaker 1>and get away with it because people </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>

1146
00:53:30.190 --> 00:53:31.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1147
00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:33.300
<v Speaker 1>in terms of the ftes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of law,</v>

1148
00:53:33.301 --> 00:53:34.500
<v Speaker 1>lawsuits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

1149
00:53:34.501 --> 00:53:35.850
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I wanted to give it to</v>

1150
00:53:35.851 --> 00:53:37.590
<v Speaker 1>people that never had it before to </v>
<v Speaker 1>speak.</v>

1151
00:53:37.591 --> 00:53:41.220
<v Speaker 1>So there'll be no expectations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone said this is terrible,</v>

1152
00:53:41.221 --> 00:53:42.054
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to turn it to heroin </v>

1153
00:53:42.391 --> 00:53:44.490
<v Speaker 1>addicts from giving them stuff like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1154
00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:45.353
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to see basic stuff like </v>

1155
00:53:46.970 --> 00:53:50.970
<v Speaker 1>does it dilate the pupils of the eyes </v>
<v Speaker 1>because cops were busting people,</v>

1156
00:53:51.170 --> 00:53:52.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd say their eyes are dilated,</v>

1157
00:53:53.210 --> 00:53:54.800
<v Speaker 1>must be high on marijuana and they'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>searched,</v>

1158
00:53:54.810 --> 00:53:55.643
<v Speaker 1>but marijuana doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't dilate the pupils of the </v>

1159
00:53:58.081 --> 00:53:59.690
<v Speaker 1>eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took chat,</v>

1160
00:53:59.700 --> 00:54:00.533
<v Speaker 1>tested blood sugar because people said </v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason people get hungry is because </v>

1161
00:54:03.181 --> 00:54:05.310
<v Speaker 1>blood sugar drops has no effect on blood</v>
<v Speaker 1>sugar.</v>

1162
00:54:05.730 --> 00:54:06.563
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we showed that the people who had never </v>

1163
00:54:10.501 --> 00:54:11.334
<v Speaker 1>had marijuana before in a lab,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could show slight decreases in </v>

1164
00:54:15.421 --> 00:54:16.254
<v Speaker 1>performance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in motor function and cognitive </v>

1165
00:54:18.691 --> 00:54:21.240
<v Speaker 1>function,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people who were regular users of it,</v>

1166
00:54:21.241 --> 00:54:23.330
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't show that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they added that too.</v>

1167
00:54:23.670 --> 00:54:24.503
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My take on that is that I think that </v>

1168
00:54:25.791 --> 00:54:28.080
<v Speaker 1>people that are not regular users are </v>
<v Speaker 1>freaking out.</v>

1169
00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:29.303
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because their sensations and then </v>

1170
00:54:31.830 --> 00:54:35.550
<v Speaker 1>I'll do it and they just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know how to relax.</v>

1171
00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:37.333
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the big one to me with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>physical movement because they want to </v>

1172
00:54:41.700 --> 00:54:44.910
<v Speaker 1>test drivers and all sorts of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For Marijuana.</v>

1173
00:54:44.911 --> 00:54:46.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not alcohol.</v>

1174
00:54:46.290 --> 00:54:47.970
<v Speaker 1>You're now in a completely different </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1175
00:54:48.180 --> 00:54:52.470
<v Speaker 1>If I had a choice of being a passenger </v>
<v Speaker 1>with these drivers,</v>

1176
00:54:52.471 --> 00:54:53.304
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you which one I would take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A person who had never used marijuana </v>

1177
00:54:57.020 --> 00:54:57.900
<v Speaker 1>had just smoked.</v>

1178
00:54:58.350 --> 00:55:01.590
<v Speaker 1>A person who was a user of marijuana and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just smoked it.</v>

1179
00:55:01.591 --> 00:55:04.620
<v Speaker 1>It never driven high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A person who was a user,</v>

1180
00:55:04.621 --> 00:55:05.454
<v Speaker 1>a regular user of marijuana and practice</v>
<v Speaker 1>driving high and a person with any </v>

1181
00:55:07.861 --> 00:55:10.980
<v Speaker 1>amount of alcohol in their system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I take the third as the best,</v>

1182
00:55:11.020 --> 00:55:12.250
<v Speaker 1>best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>best.</v>

1183
00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:14.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy's a wizard at bet.</v>

1184
00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:17.160
<v Speaker 1>That guy drives high every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So He's used to it.</v>

1185
00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:19.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to show any effect on his </v>
<v Speaker 1>performance.</v>

1186
00:55:19.770 --> 00:55:21.930
<v Speaker 1>The experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a novel experience.</v>

1187
00:55:21.940 --> 00:55:25.380
<v Speaker 1>And if you're accustomed to it then it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>

1188
00:55:25.381 --> 00:55:27.030
<v Speaker 1>here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is my normal world.</v>

1189
00:55:27.090 --> 00:55:28.980
<v Speaker 1>And for many people you have to learn to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get high.</v>

1190
00:55:28.981 --> 00:55:29.814
<v Speaker 1>You have to learn to associate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>subtle physical cues with the altered </v>

1191
00:55:33.301 --> 00:55:35.010
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a common thing.</v>

1192
00:55:35.011 --> 00:55:37.080
<v Speaker 1>People could feel nothing the first time</v>
<v Speaker 1>they try it.</v>

1193
00:55:37.170 --> 00:55:38.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do hear that right?</v>

1194
00:55:38.850 --> 00:55:40.550
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think they know what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck they're talking to.</v>

1195
00:55:40.910 --> 00:55:42.180
<v Speaker 1>Throw your eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

1196
00:55:42.610 --> 00:55:44.910
<v Speaker 1>Now when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1197
00:55:45.150 --> 00:55:45.983
<v Speaker 1>when you did these experiments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did you have to clear these with </v>

1198
00:55:48.331 --> 00:55:51.330
<v Speaker 1>the FPA?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did you would not believe I have to</v>

1199
00:55:51.331 --> 00:55:52.164
<v Speaker 1>do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to get permission from the FDA </v>

1200
00:55:53.671 --> 00:55:54.504
<v Speaker 1>which said that I couldn't do it unless </v>
<v Speaker 1>I first got permission from it was the </v>

1201
00:55:57.031 --> 00:55:59.820
<v Speaker 1>old Federal Bureau of narcotics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was the treasury guys.</v>

1202
00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:01.223
<v Speaker 1>The federal bureaucratic said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll give you permission once the FDA </v>

1203
00:56:03.661 --> 00:56:05.790
<v Speaker 1>gives you permission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they played that off,</v>

1204
00:56:06.090 --> 00:56:09.390
<v Speaker 1>then I had to get permission from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>state of Massachusetts from two agencies</v>

1205
00:56:09.391 --> 00:56:11.750
<v Speaker 1>there and there were two universities </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved,</v>

1206
00:56:11.850 --> 00:56:13.830
<v Speaker 1>Harvard University and Boston </v>
<v Speaker 1>University.</v>

1207
00:56:14.010 --> 00:56:16.830
<v Speaker 1>So coordinating all this stuff was </v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievable.</v>

1208
00:56:16.831 --> 00:56:18.930
<v Speaker 1>And then once the old the approvals came</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1209
00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:21.480
<v Speaker 1>I had to get the pot and there was no </v>
<v Speaker 1>legal source of it.</v>

1210
00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:22.700
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1211
00:56:22.910 --> 00:56:24.220
<v Speaker 1>the Federal Bureau of narcotics</v>

1212
00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:27.970
<v Speaker 2>gave me confiscated pot that they had </v>
<v Speaker 2>confiscated case in Texas.</v>

1213
00:56:28.810 --> 00:56:31.360
<v Speaker 2>They brought it over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had delayed for so long.</v>

1214
00:56:31.361 --> 00:56:32.194
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even know her that time to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>the experiments because I was going to </v>

1215
00:56:33.761 --> 00:56:34.594
<v Speaker 2>graduate anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They brought this stuff on a Friday </v>

1216
00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:37.900
<v Speaker 2>afternoon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was shit.</v>

1217
00:56:37.901 --> 00:56:38.734
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was brown dry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looked like even sitting in a </v>

1218
00:56:40.091 --> 00:56:40.924
<v Speaker 2>warehouse for years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the first thing I did was roll up a </v>

1219
00:56:42.611 --> 00:56:44.470
<v Speaker 2>joint and smoke it no effect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1220
00:56:44.471 --> 00:56:47.230
<v Speaker 2>I called the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the agent that I dealt with and I said,</v>

1221
00:56:47.231 --> 00:56:48.700
<v Speaker 2>this stuff is no good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

1222
00:56:48.701 --> 00:56:51.010
<v Speaker 2>how do you know you haven't had time to </v>
<v Speaker 2>run any experiments?</v>

1223
00:56:51.011 --> 00:56:51.844
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I looked at it under the microscope and </v>

1224
00:56:52.811 --> 00:56:53.644
<v Speaker 2>there was no resonance on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they grumbled and they gave me other </v>

1225
00:56:56.021 --> 00:56:59.320
<v Speaker 2>stuff which was passable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>

1226
00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:00.790
<v Speaker 2>confiscated stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1227
00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:03.880
<v Speaker 2>Because we always used to hear when we </v>
<v Speaker 2>were kids about government,</v>

1228
00:57:03.881 --> 00:57:06.870
<v Speaker 2>we'd the government lead was the good </v>
<v Speaker 2>weed.</v>

1229
00:57:06.900 --> 00:57:09.140
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember later?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was later when that,</v>

1230
00:57:09.490 --> 00:57:10.323
<v Speaker 2>when research got going and the US </v>
<v Speaker 2>government started a pot farm in </v>

1231
00:57:14.231 --> 00:57:17.500
<v Speaker 2>Mississippi to provide proper research,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was much better.</v>

1232
00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:20.890
<v Speaker 2>And there was only a handful of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that were under these experiments.</v>

1233
00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:26.400
<v Speaker 2>So they made it so difficult to conduct </v>
<v Speaker 2>research as they have with psychedelics.</v>

1234
00:57:26.861 --> 00:57:28.450
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's slowly changing now.</v>

1235
00:57:28.510 --> 00:57:29.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1236
00:57:29.381 --> 00:57:31.270
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know Rick Strassman?</v>

1237
00:57:31.300 --> 00:57:32.020
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1238
00:57:32.020 --> 00:57:34.420
<v Speaker 2>When he was doing that book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dmt,</v>

1239
00:57:34.421 --> 00:57:37.600
<v Speaker 2>the spirit molecule and he did all those</v>
<v Speaker 2>tests with those people.</v>

1240
00:57:37.601 --> 00:57:39.670
<v Speaker 2>That was really groundbreaking stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>

1241
00:57:39.671 --> 00:57:41.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it at the University of New Mexico</v>

1242
00:57:41.531 --> 00:57:42.364
<v Speaker 2>and doing my clinical conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were able to document the </v>

1243
00:57:44.861 --> 00:57:48.880
<v Speaker 2>similarities between all these people's </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic experiences and do this with</v>

1244
00:57:48.910 --> 00:57:51.820
<v Speaker 2>government approval,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I thought was really fascinating.</v>

1245
00:57:51.850 --> 00:57:52.770
<v Speaker 2>Fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1246
00:57:52.771 --> 00:57:53.604
<v Speaker 2>And the fact that they did it and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>information's out and then there's been </v>

1247
00:57:57.850 --> 00:58:00.250
<v Speaker 2>very little movement in that direction.</v>

1248
00:58:00.820 --> 00:58:02.110
<v Speaker 2>It's Kinda just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1249
00:58:02.170 --> 00:58:03.670
<v Speaker 2>now we know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but look,</v>

1250
00:58:03.671 --> 00:58:06.030
<v Speaker 2>everybody's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of benefit do,</v>

1251
00:58:06.050 --> 00:58:07.830
<v Speaker 2>do we want to act on this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1252
00:58:08.010 --> 00:58:09.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it takes decades,</v>

1253
00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:13.840
<v Speaker 2>forever and flawless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What research was done all along,</v>

1254
00:58:13.900 --> 00:58:16.110
<v Speaker 2>it was February to look for negative </v>
<v Speaker 2>effects.</v>

1255
00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:17.570
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1256
00:58:17.700 --> 00:58:19.900
<v Speaker 2>Nobody who wanted to look for positive </v>
<v Speaker 2>effects.</v>

1257
00:58:19.930 --> 00:58:22.360
<v Speaker 2>Got Permission and funding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>

1258
00:58:22.361 --> 00:58:25.810
<v Speaker 2>So you have to kind of frame the </v>
<v Speaker 2>proposal in a way that like,</v>

1259
00:58:25.820 --> 00:58:28.840
<v Speaker 2>were these kids are fucking themselves </v>
<v Speaker 2>up and we're gonna prove it sir.</v>

1260
00:58:29.470 --> 00:58:30.550
<v Speaker 2>So that's changing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

1261
00:58:30.551 --> 00:58:31.384
<v Speaker 2>the big stumbling block now we got to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get a cannabis out of that federal </v>

1262
00:58:34.931 --> 00:58:37.930
<v Speaker 2>schedule.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like causing a lot of problems.</v>

1263
00:58:38.020 --> 00:58:38.853
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's been some noise about </v>

1264
00:58:40.390 --> 00:58:43.510
<v Speaker 2>decriminalizing decriminalizing it </v>
<v Speaker 2>federally,</v>

1265
00:58:43.540 --> 00:58:46.480
<v Speaker 2>which is like step one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess that's a big stumbling block.</v>

1266
00:58:46.481 --> 00:58:47.314
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you one example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm involved with a group called Maui </v>

1267
00:58:51.221 --> 00:58:53.950
<v Speaker 2>wellness group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the chief science officer now.</v>

1268
00:58:53.951 --> 00:58:54.850
<v Speaker 2>He Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1269
00:58:54.851 --> 00:58:58.330
<v Speaker 2>We got the first dispensary license and </v>
<v Speaker 2>growing operation over there.</v>

1270
00:58:58.390 --> 00:58:59.500
<v Speaker 2>Oh Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very good,</v>

1271
00:58:59.790 --> 00:59:03.580
<v Speaker 2>very good example in Hawaii for medical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not for recreational,</v>

1272
00:59:03.610 --> 00:59:08.270
<v Speaker 2>like how sick you have to be where </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're getting a little you,</v>

1273
00:59:08.500 --> 00:59:09.333
<v Speaker 2>but they're specified conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hawaii's not is more uptight than a lot </v>

1274
00:59:13.061 --> 00:59:15.570
<v Speaker 2>of other states it's happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

1275
00:59:15.610 --> 00:59:19.270
<v Speaker 2>our licenses for Maui County,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which includes Mallory Mold County,</v>

1276
00:59:19.310 --> 00:59:22.010
<v Speaker 2>Illinois,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so people from all the time and I</v>

1277
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:24.980
<v Speaker 1>can come to Maui to buy product and our </v>
<v Speaker 1>dispensary,</v>

1278
00:59:24.981 --> 00:59:28.460
<v Speaker 1>but they can't take it back because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>waters between the island or federal,</v>

1279
00:59:29.360 --> 00:59:32.660
<v Speaker 1>they throw it still has to cross the </v>
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>

1280
00:59:32.790 --> 00:59:34.070
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's ridiculous.</v>

1281
00:59:34.071 --> 00:59:35.600
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's federal,</v>

1282
00:59:35.630 --> 00:59:37.730
<v Speaker 1>that's a kind of as the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous situation.</v>

1283
00:59:37.840 --> 00:59:40.490
<v Speaker 2>So better to be in Maui and not better </v>
<v Speaker 2>to run.</v>

1284
00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:42.910
<v Speaker 2>I got to go to Maui to get high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>

1285
00:59:42.911 --> 00:59:43.744
<v Speaker 2>What if you're really sick?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what have you have cancer or </v>

1286
00:59:44.621 --> 00:59:46.100
<v Speaker 2>something like that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1287
00:59:46.270 --> 00:59:47.260
<v Speaker 2>on live,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on Lanai.</v>

1288
00:59:47.320 --> 00:59:49.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you got to violate the law,</v>

1289
00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:51.850
<v Speaker 2>but if you have it in Lanai,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're okay.</v>

1290
00:59:52.210 --> 00:59:54.580
<v Speaker 2>So can you grow it a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1291
00:59:54.640 --> 00:59:56.200
<v Speaker 2>you can only grow it if you have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>license.</v>

1292
00:59:56.201 --> 01:00:00.310
<v Speaker 2>And the only licenses for Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got to change this.</v>

1293
01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:03.490
<v Speaker 2>California was really ridiculous when </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were doing medical look.</v>

1294
01:00:03.491 --> 01:00:04.850
<v Speaker 2>You can just basically go in there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>go like,</v>

1295
01:00:04.851 --> 01:00:06.030
<v Speaker 2>I can't sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then go.</v>

1296
01:00:06.031 --> 01:00:07.020
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1297
01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:08.413
<v Speaker 2>It was nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I had friends that had like long </v>

1298
01:00:11.110 --> 01:00:13.970
<v Speaker 2>elaborate excuses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have planned out like,</v>

1299
01:00:14.290 --> 01:00:15.123
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in a car accident while six and I </v>

1300
01:00:17.650 --> 01:00:19.570
<v Speaker 2>go to bed at night and I have these </v>
<v Speaker 2>horrible dreams.</v>

1301
01:00:19.571 --> 01:00:22.270
<v Speaker 2>The only thing that helps you is </v>
<v Speaker 2>marijuana and I'm just trying to feed my</v>

1302
01:00:22.271 --> 01:00:23.290
<v Speaker 2>family and that they would go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop,</v>

1303
01:00:23.291 --> 01:00:24.124
<v Speaker 2>stop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop.</v>

1304
01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:26.800
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm read this script and just give it to</v>

1305
01:00:26.801 --> 01:00:28.210
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was no resistance.</v>

1306
01:00:28.330 --> 01:00:29.163
<v Speaker 2>If you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My joke was that if you can't get a </v>

1307
01:00:31.331 --> 01:00:32.164
<v Speaker 2>license for marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you probably go to a hospital </v>

1308
01:00:33.530 --> 01:00:35.620
<v Speaker 2>immediately because you had a real </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

1309
01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:36.611
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no man,</v>

1310
01:00:36.611 --> 01:00:37.730
<v Speaker 2>you need an actual doctor.</v>

1311
01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:41.070
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you a story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is something that bothers me though</v>

1312
01:00:41.071 --> 01:00:42.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a user of pot.</v>

1313
01:00:42.871 --> 01:00:45.920
<v Speaker 1>And I was heavily in my earlier life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A friend of mine,</v>

1314
01:00:45.921 --> 01:00:48.780
<v Speaker 1>Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Colleagues in San Francisco sent me some</v>

1315
01:00:48.781 --> 01:00:49.614
<v Speaker 1>samples of stuff that had come from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>medical dispensary in San Francisco and </v>

1316
01:00:53.101 --> 01:00:56.670
<v Speaker 1>he wanted me to try them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of them was a concentrated oil,</v>

1317
01:00:56.671 --> 01:00:57.504
<v Speaker 1>it came in a little syringe and an ad </v>
<v Speaker 1>had a very elaborate nicely printed </v>

1318
01:01:02.430 --> 01:01:03.263
<v Speaker 1>brochure with it that describe the use </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this pain and it said you should </v>

1319
01:01:06.091 --> 01:01:09.660
<v Speaker 1>start with an amount the size of half a </v>
<v Speaker 1>grain of rice,</v>

1320
01:01:10.130 --> 01:01:11.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take it orally.</v>

1321
01:01:11.581 --> 01:01:14.280
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friends had taken at bedtime,</v>

1322
01:01:14.281 --> 01:01:15.114
<v Speaker 1>so this is a teeny amount and actually I</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably took somewhat less because I </v>

1323
01:01:17.281 --> 01:01:20.040
<v Speaker 1>was afraid of getting too high on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I take it at bed time,</v>

1324
01:01:20.310 --> 01:01:21.143
<v Speaker 1>went to sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>woke up about an hour later in full </v>

1325
01:01:23.821 --> 01:01:24.870
<v Speaker 1>blown delirium.</v>

1326
01:01:24.870 --> 01:01:25.703
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>visual hallucinations as strong as I've </v>

1327
01:01:28.501 --> 01:01:30.270
<v Speaker 1>had on LSD.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't get out of bed.</v>

1328
01:01:30.271 --> 01:01:30.590
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1329
01:01:30.590 --> 01:01:31.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was immobile.</v>

1330
01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:33.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had burning thirst.</v>

1331
01:01:33.031 --> 01:01:34.590
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't get up to get a glass of </v>
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>

1332
01:01:34.591 --> 01:01:38.280
<v Speaker 1>I had a friends thing and a guest house </v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't call for help.</v>

1333
01:01:38.790 --> 01:01:39.623
<v Speaker 1>I laid there and it kept increasing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Over four hours it got stronger and </v>

1334
01:01:43.291 --> 01:01:45.720
<v Speaker 1>stronger and when is it gonna end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

1335
01:01:45.721 --> 01:01:46.554
<v Speaker 1>it lasted 12 hours and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for about 24 hours after my equilibrium </v>

1336
01:01:51.421 --> 01:01:55.350
<v Speaker 1>was really long and this stuff is being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it said,</v>

1337
01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:56.333
<v Speaker 1>it said the direction said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>start with this amount and work up from </v>

1338
01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:01.040
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People.</v>

1339
01:02:01.050 --> 01:02:03.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking there's people driving on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the streets.</v>

1340
01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:05.850
<v Speaker 1>This stuff is out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That scares me.</v>

1341
01:02:06.090 --> 01:02:06.923
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's people that support that whole </v>

1342
01:02:07.621 --> 01:02:12.210
<v Speaker 1>thing and their gullet right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you know.</v>

1343
01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:12.910
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1344
01:02:12.910 --> 01:02:13.743
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the edible world is a weird </v>

1345
01:02:16.511 --> 01:02:18.040
<v Speaker 2>world because of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1346
01:02:18.140 --> 01:02:18.973
<v Speaker 2>the response.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The body is so much different than the </v>

1347
01:02:20.551 --> 01:02:24.200
<v Speaker 2>smoking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Different drug as a lot of the,</v>

1348
01:02:24.730 --> 01:02:26.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the long length of time it takes.</v>

1349
01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:28.620
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like lighting the fireworks and the</v>

1350
01:02:28.621 --> 01:02:30.970
<v Speaker 2>fuse is down and you go back and try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>light it again.</v>

1351
01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:36.040
<v Speaker 2>And I'm sure you've heard the recording </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the police officers who stole the pot</v>

1352
01:02:36.451 --> 01:02:40.600
<v Speaker 2>from the kids and then ate it and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>called nine slash 11 on themselves.</v>

1353
01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:41.690
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never heard it.</v>

1354
01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:42.720
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's wonderful.</v>

1355
01:02:42.750 --> 01:02:45.060
<v Speaker 2>I'll play it again because we played it </v>
<v Speaker 2>too many times in this podcast.</v>

1356
01:02:45.061 --> 01:02:45.680
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll look it up.</v>

1357
01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:46.513
<v Speaker 2>But this poor cops,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they ate pot brownies and they're </v>

1358
01:02:49.231 --> 01:02:50.064
<v Speaker 2>calling nine slash 11 like I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're dying times moving really </v>

1359
01:02:52.761 --> 01:02:55.740
<v Speaker 2>slowly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're dead so stupid.</v>

1360
01:02:56.260 --> 01:02:57.640
<v Speaker 2>So stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1361
01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:00.440
<v Speaker 2>it's good for kids to hear because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>realize like,</v>

1362
01:03:00.450 --> 01:03:01.710
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cops are just people.</v>

1363
01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:02.780
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right.</v>

1364
01:03:02.790 --> 01:03:03.623
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

1365
01:03:03.630 --> 01:03:05.580
<v Speaker 2>it sounds like my brother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my brother got high.</v>

1366
01:03:05.581 --> 01:03:06.450
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy.</v>

1367
01:03:06.451 --> 01:03:07.284
<v Speaker 2>People that get high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the effect of the edible can be </v>

1368
01:03:10.981 --> 01:03:12.960
<v Speaker 2>pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty fucking profound.</v>

1369
01:03:12.961 --> 01:03:13.794
<v Speaker 2>And this area in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Hollywood has some pre imposturous </v>

1370
01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:21.020
<v Speaker 2>thc level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine.</v>

1371
01:03:21.030 --> 01:03:21.863
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're under different regulations now </v>

1372
01:03:23.761 --> 01:03:26.280
<v Speaker 2>that it's legal statewide instead of </v>
<v Speaker 2>just medical,</v>

1373
01:03:26.430 --> 01:03:31.430
<v Speaker 2>but when it was medical only,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could get these insane concoctions.</v>

1374
01:03:32.010 --> 01:03:32.843
<v Speaker 2>Stars of death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ever heard of a startup that will </v>

1375
01:03:36.550 --> 01:03:39.990
<v Speaker 2>hit you with a star at death stars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like 1200 milligrams.</v>

1376
01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:43.270
<v Speaker 2>They range anywhere from like 200 to </v>
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>

1377
01:03:43.330 --> 01:03:44.163
<v Speaker 2>400.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Each little star is hundreds of </v>

1378
01:03:48.030 --> 01:03:50.370
<v Speaker 2>milligrams and joey would eat like three</v>
<v Speaker 2>or four of them ate.</v>

1379
01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:53.550
<v Speaker 2>He would just throw them down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a,</v>

1380
01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:58.560
<v Speaker 2>he's got an insane tolerance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just wanted these guys given all this</v>

1381
01:03:58.561 --> 01:03:59.394
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

1382
01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:04.180
<v Speaker 1>I am delighted to see our society </v>
<v Speaker 1>finally coming to better terms with this</v>

1383
01:04:04.190 --> 01:04:07.760
<v Speaker 1>plant me to cannabis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1384
01:04:07.761 --> 01:04:08.594
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1385
01:04:08.630 --> 01:04:10.730
<v Speaker 1>the word cannabis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same word as canvas.</v>

1386
01:04:11.170 --> 01:04:14.210
<v Speaker 1>All canvas sales and rope used to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>made from hemp.</v>

1387
01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:15.513
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the and the species name Sativa means </v>

1388
01:04:17.871 --> 01:04:18.980
<v Speaker 1>useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's useful.</v>

1389
01:04:19.700 --> 01:04:20.840
<v Speaker 1>It's really useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1390
01:04:20.841 --> 01:04:21.674
<v Speaker 1>this is one plant that provides an </v>
<v Speaker 1>edible seed and edible oil of high </v>

1391
01:04:25.731 --> 01:04:26.780
<v Speaker 1>quality fiber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1392
01:04:26.781 --> 01:04:30.530
<v Speaker 1>medicine and an intoxicant that's a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of ways for a plant to be useful.</v>

1393
01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:31.783
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have been very stupid in our </v>

1394
01:04:33.081 --> 01:04:36.830
<v Speaker 1>relationship with that plant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cannabis,</v>

1395
01:04:36.850 --> 01:04:39.680
<v Speaker 1>it's the equivalent of the dog in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>plant world.</v>

1396
01:04:39.770 --> 01:04:43.370
<v Speaker 1>Dogs long ago made a decision to co </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolve with us.</v>

1397
01:04:43.371 --> 01:04:45.950
<v Speaker 1>They threw their evolutionary lot in </v>
<v Speaker 1>with humans.</v>

1398
01:04:46.370 --> 01:04:47.203
<v Speaker 1>Cannabis did the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't unravel the early botanical </v>

1399
01:04:49.881 --> 01:04:53.120
<v Speaker 1>history of cannabis because as far back </v>
<v Speaker 1>in history as we go,</v>

1400
01:04:53.450 --> 01:04:55.490
<v Speaker 1>it's always associated with human </v>
<v Speaker 1>settlements.</v>

1401
01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:59.780
<v Speaker 1>So that plant wants nothing other than </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be with us at the service.</v>

1402
01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:00.913
<v Speaker 1>And we have been so stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've led a billion dollar industry and </v>

1403
01:05:04.070 --> 01:05:04.903
<v Speaker 1>textiles go to China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've let a million dollar industry and </v>

1404
01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:11.660
<v Speaker 1>edible hemp products go to Canada and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>have ignored.</v>

1405
01:05:11.661 --> 01:05:12.920
<v Speaker 1>That's potential for medicine.</v>

1406
01:05:13.330 --> 01:05:14.163
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really hoping that things are gonna </v>

1407
01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:17.590
<v Speaker 2>change in terms they will far </v>
<v Speaker 2>cultivation hemp,</v>

1408
01:05:17.970 --> 01:05:18.803
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm one of the owners of on it and we </v>

1409
01:05:20.651 --> 01:05:21.484
<v Speaker 2>sell hemp protein and one of the great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We used to get our hemp protein from </v>

1410
01:05:25.061 --> 01:05:25.750
<v Speaker 2>Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1411
01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:28.420
<v Speaker 2>We used to have to get it from Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We sell it in America.</v>

1412
01:05:28.421 --> 01:05:30.160
<v Speaker 2>We couldn't grow it here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stupid.</v>

1413
01:05:30.190 --> 01:05:33.400
<v Speaker 2>Well that's going to change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so hopeful.</v>

1414
01:05:33.460 --> 01:05:34.660
<v Speaker 2>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does change.</v>

1415
01:05:35.020 --> 01:05:35.853
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fascinating also how well the </v>

1416
01:05:39.191 --> 01:05:40.024
<v Speaker 2>propaganda worked against it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how long even defiance of all the </v>

1417
01:05:43.541 --> 01:05:45.160
<v Speaker 2>facts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I have to tell you,</v>

1418
01:05:45.161 --> 01:05:45.994
<v Speaker 2>when I did those pot explorers 1968,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I predicted that pop was going to be </v>

1419
01:05:50.351 --> 01:05:52.240
<v Speaker 2>legal in five years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boy,</v>

1420
01:05:52.241 --> 01:05:53.660
<v Speaker 2>was I wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1421
01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:54.200
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1422
01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:55.033
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was just a matter of </v>

1423
01:05:55.421 --> 01:05:57.460
<v Speaker 2>getting the truthful information out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1424
01:05:57.670 --> 01:05:58.480
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't.</v>

1425
01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:00.250
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people believe what they want to believe</v>

1426
01:06:00.251 --> 01:06:02.260
<v Speaker 2>and they don't believe what they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to believe in its root.</v>

1427
01:06:02.261 --> 01:06:03.700
<v Speaker 2>It's totally irrational.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1428
01:06:03.701 --> 01:06:08.701
<v Speaker 2>it's also a really excellent example of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the contradictions in our society.</v>

1429
01:06:10.180 --> 01:06:14.100
<v Speaker 2>The difference between something that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>accurate and something that's perceived.</v>

1430
01:06:14.101 --> 01:06:14.934
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we have this perception of marrow </v>

1431
01:06:17.041 --> 01:06:17.874
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and sometimes they have perceptions </v>

1432
01:06:19.331 --> 01:06:22.450
<v Speaker 2>based on experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you might meet some really lazy,</v>

1433
01:06:22.451 --> 01:06:24.430
<v Speaker 2>fucked up people smoke pot all the time </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you go,</v>

1434
01:06:24.431 --> 01:06:25.810
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what pot does to you.</v>

1435
01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:30.970
<v Speaker 2>Also it was the associations of pot </v>
<v Speaker 2>because back then you know,</v>

1436
01:06:30.971 --> 01:06:32.140
<v Speaker 2>in the fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sixties,</v>

1437
01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:37.440
<v Speaker 2>it was associated with Mexican migrant </v>
<v Speaker 2>workers with black jazz musicians in the</v>

1438
01:06:37.661 --> 01:06:42.340
<v Speaker 2>south and then with radicals and hippy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so all scary people to mainstream,</v>

1439
01:06:42.780 --> 01:06:45.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>middle class white society and of course</v>

1440
01:06:46.090 --> 01:06:46.923
<v Speaker 2>all accentuated by William Randolph </v>
<v Speaker 2>hearst and Harry anslinger and the </v>

1441
01:06:50.261 --> 01:06:51.460
<v Speaker 2>reefer madness films.</v>

1442
01:06:52.150 --> 01:06:53.120
<v Speaker 2>Those are great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're great.</v>

1443
01:06:53.170 --> 01:06:54.003
<v Speaker 2>Anybody hasn't seen those out there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing how something that was </v>

1444
01:06:57.551 --> 01:06:58.384
<v Speaker 2>terrifying to someone back then is so </v>
<v Speaker 2>silly today when you watch the reefer </v>

1445
01:07:01.991 --> 01:07:02.824
<v Speaker 2>madness to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really funny and at the same time </v>

1446
01:07:05.081 --> 01:07:05.914
<v Speaker 2>we're living with the two most dangerous</v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs that are out there with alcohol </v>

1447
01:07:09.341 --> 01:07:10.270
<v Speaker 2>and tobacco.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1448
01:07:10.271 --> 01:07:11.104
<v Speaker 2>how about fentanyl?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That one's cute shit out of me to just </v>

1449
01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:16.180
<v Speaker 2>keep wrapping that one up and making it </v>
<v Speaker 2>more and more potent.</v>

1450
01:07:16.181 --> 01:07:17.014
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the idea that opioids weren't </v>

1451
01:07:19.271 --> 01:07:20.104
<v Speaker 2>killing people quick enough that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>needed to make some ridiculously potent </v>

1452
01:07:23.561 --> 01:07:24.394
<v Speaker 2>versions of it and apparently now </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's they're approving something </v>

1453
01:07:26.801 --> 01:07:30.670
<v Speaker 2>that's even more powerful like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but why would you do that?</v>

1454
01:07:30.700 --> 01:07:32.920
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a physiological level,</v>

1455
01:07:32.921 --> 01:07:37.921
<v Speaker 2>opioids are not that bad for your body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The worst effect of being addicted to an</v>

1456
01:07:40.001 --> 01:07:42.850
<v Speaker 2>opioid overtime is chronic constipation.</v>

1457
01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:43.953
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's annoying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not like cirrhosis of the </v>

1458
01:07:46.001 --> 01:07:48.640
<v Speaker 2>liver degeneration of the nervous </v>
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>

1459
01:07:48.670 --> 01:07:50.680
<v Speaker 2>but overdoses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>overdoses,</v>

1460
01:07:50.681 --> 01:07:51.514
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that kills me by stopping your </v>

1461
01:07:52.241 --> 01:07:53.074
<v Speaker 2>respiration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are many examples of people </v>

1462
01:07:55.271 --> 01:07:59.260
<v Speaker 2>who have been addicted to opioids who </v>
<v Speaker 2>have been able to get legal supplies and</v>

1463
01:07:59.261 --> 01:08:02.170
<v Speaker 2>he used them extensively.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're healthy.</v>

1464
01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:03.393
<v Speaker 2>I've heard about that when in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>regular heroin use that I had a friend </v>

1465
01:08:07.601 --> 01:08:10.450
<v Speaker 2>who was a Longshoreman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is like when I was a kid,</v>

1466
01:08:10.451 --> 01:08:11.284
<v Speaker 2>he was explaining to me how this guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he worked with would get a bag of </v>

1467
01:08:14.501 --> 01:08:16.190
<v Speaker 2>heroin every day at lunch</v>

1468
01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:17.353
<v Speaker 1>and he would shoot it in his car and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>would just sit in his car during lunch </v>

1469
01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:22.010
<v Speaker 1>hour and then when the time was up you'd</v>
<v Speaker 1>go back to work.</v>

1470
01:08:22.011 --> 01:08:22.910
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

1471
01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:24.700
<v Speaker 1>He said he would do that everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1472
01:08:24.730 --> 01:08:26.360
<v Speaker 1>she's going to be dead in a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1473
01:08:26.361 --> 01:08:27.890
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knows that if he knows the other take</v>

1474
01:08:27.891 --> 01:08:29.810
<v Speaker 1>care of himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently he did.</v>

1475
01:08:29.900 --> 01:08:31.830
<v Speaker 1>Apparently he would do it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1476
01:08:31.910 --> 01:08:32.743
<v Speaker 1>I guess find a new vein and figuring out</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to do it and not famous historical </v>

1477
01:08:37.761 --> 01:08:38.850
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>

1478
01:08:38.900 --> 01:08:39.733
<v Speaker 1>There was a man named William holstead </v>
<v Speaker 1>who was a surgeon at Johns Hopkins </v>

1479
01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:44.413
<v Speaker 1>University in the early 19 hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He invented a local anesthesia and so </v>

1480
01:08:48.570 --> 01:08:49.403
<v Speaker 1>get a great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He started using cocaine and injected </v>

1481
01:08:53.211 --> 01:08:56.000
<v Speaker 1>self-injected cocaine and not a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

1482
01:08:56.030 --> 01:08:56.940
<v Speaker 1>and his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1483
01:08:57.170 --> 01:08:59.900
<v Speaker 1>his behavior got really bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not good,</v>

1484
01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:01.033
<v Speaker 1>so at some point his group of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>colleague kidnapped them and took them </v>

1485
01:09:04.101 --> 01:09:06.590
<v Speaker 1>on a yacht for several weeks and he came</v>
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>

1486
01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:07.453
<v Speaker 1>supposedly cured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a long life as a very successful </v>

1487
01:09:10.401 --> 01:09:14.310
<v Speaker 1>productive surgeon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and only after his death was it revealed</v>

1488
01:09:14.311 --> 01:09:15.144
<v Speaker 1>that what had happened on that trip was </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they had gotten them off cocaine </v>

1489
01:09:17.571 --> 01:09:21.320
<v Speaker 1>and onto intravenous morphine for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rest of his life.</v>

1490
01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:22.153
<v Speaker 1>He was an intravenous morphine user.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did Not in any way interfere with his </v>

1491
01:09:25.251 --> 01:09:28.130
<v Speaker 1>health or productivity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would assume that if you're doing that</v>

1492
01:09:28.131 --> 01:09:28.964
<v Speaker 1>every day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to run into issues with </v>

1493
01:09:30.351 --> 01:09:31.520
<v Speaker 1>your veins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1494
01:09:31.830 --> 01:09:32.840
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Presumably,</v>

1495
01:09:32.841 --> 01:09:34.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he knew how to rotate around that,</v>

1496
01:09:35.510 --> 01:09:37.280
<v Speaker 1>that I wouldn't want to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there it is.</v>

1497
01:09:37.390 --> 01:09:38.223
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the point is that it's a whole </v>

1498
01:09:40.401 --> 01:09:44.510
<v Speaker 1>different game from alcohol and tobacco.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1499
01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:46.430
<v Speaker 1>a whole a whole different game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all problems,</v>

1500
01:09:46.431 --> 01:09:48.740
<v Speaker 1>it's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the social toxicity of it.</v>

1501
01:09:48.741 --> 01:09:49.574
<v Speaker 1>It's that it's that people are buying </v>
<v Speaker 1>illegal impure materials and overdosing </v>

1502
01:09:55.041 --> 01:09:56.290
<v Speaker 1>and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not the,</v>

1503
01:09:56.291 --> 01:09:57.124
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nate pharmacological nature of the </v>

1504
01:09:58.461 --> 01:09:59.294
<v Speaker 1>drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's been disturbing to me as a </v>

1505
01:10:00.621 --> 01:10:01.970
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an observer,</v>

1506
01:10:01.971 --> 01:10:04.920
<v Speaker 1>is watching people who get injured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get hooked on it,</v>

1507
01:10:05.310 --> 01:10:08.300
<v Speaker 1>get it particularly pills yet it seems </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1508
01:10:08.350 --> 01:10:08.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

1509
01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:09.793
<v Speaker 1>my good friend Brendan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had his nose broken and he got his </v>

1510
01:10:12.531 --> 01:10:15.050
<v Speaker 1>nose fixed and they put him on pills and</v>
<v Speaker 1>before he knew it,</v>

1511
01:10:15.051 --> 01:10:17.180
<v Speaker 1>he was taking those pills everyday for </v>
<v Speaker 1>months and months and months.</v>

1512
01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:18.013
<v Speaker 1>And his friends eventually just took him</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of his medicine cabinet and they </v>

1513
01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:23.590
<v Speaker 1>just made an intervention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1514
01:10:23.591 --> 01:10:24.171
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

1515
01:10:24.171 --> 01:10:25.220
<v Speaker 1>I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1516
01:10:25.221 --> 01:10:26.054
<v Speaker 1>the opioid crisis that we've got in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>country is a fabulous opportunity for </v>

1517
01:10:28.791 --> 01:10:29.624
<v Speaker 1>integrative medicine because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>realization is that you cannot manage </v>

1518
01:10:32.901 --> 01:10:33.734
<v Speaker 1>chronic pain solely with use of opioids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there has to be individualized </v>

1519
01:10:38.541 --> 01:10:41.930
<v Speaker 1>integrative treatment that use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uses different modalities.</v>

1520
01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:44.210
<v Speaker 1>It could be everything from acupuncture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yoga,</v>

1521
01:10:44.211 --> 01:10:46.070
<v Speaker 1>mind body stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>diet,</v>

1522
01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:48.133
<v Speaker 1>and that all has to be the state of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Oregon a couple of years ago passed an </v>

1523
01:10:50.390 --> 01:10:53.900
<v Speaker 1>integrative pain management initiative </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying that all pain,</v>

1524
01:10:53.901 --> 01:10:56.870
<v Speaker 1>chronic pain management had to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>integrated and they listed the different</v>

1525
01:10:56.871 --> 01:10:58.820
<v Speaker 1>modalities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They left out mind body medicine,</v>

1526
01:10:58.821 --> 01:11:00.530
<v Speaker 1>which to me is one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

1527
01:11:01.580 --> 01:11:04.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mind body medicine though on any sort of</v>

1528
01:11:04.090 --> 01:11:06.860
<v Speaker 1>report that seems like that's when like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1529
01:11:06.861 --> 01:11:07.694
<v Speaker 1>what kind of.</v>

1530
01:11:07.870 --> 01:11:09.080
<v Speaker 1>But look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know I studied.</v>

1531
01:11:09.081 --> 01:11:09.761
<v Speaker 1>I'm with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1532
01:11:09.761 --> 01:11:10.594
<v Speaker 1>I studied hypnosis after I got out of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>medical training and one of the most </v>

1533
01:11:14.071 --> 01:11:18.480
<v Speaker 1>interesting courses I ever took.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a well known demonstration in,</v>

1534
01:11:18.740 --> 01:11:22.290
<v Speaker 1>in the literature on hypnosis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can take a person deeply hidden.</v>

1535
01:11:22.300 --> 01:11:23.133
<v Speaker 1>Pfizer's got good trans capacity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>touch them with a finger that you </v>

1536
01:11:26.341 --> 01:11:27.174
<v Speaker 1>represent to be a piece of hot metal and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get a blister and you can take the </v>

1537
01:11:30.751 --> 01:11:31.584
<v Speaker 1>same person that touched him with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>piece of hot metal and tell them it's </v>

1538
01:11:33.601 --> 01:11:35.820
<v Speaker 1>cold and they don't get a blister.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute.</v>

1539
01:11:35.850 --> 01:11:36.683
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

1540
01:11:37.590 --> 01:11:40.590
<v Speaker 1>Well known phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is actually if you ever seen this.</v>

1541
01:11:40.690 --> 01:11:41.490
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Real life.</v>

1542
01:11:41.490 --> 01:11:42.323
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So someone's taken a hot piece of metal </v>

1543
01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:45.790
<v Speaker 1>and convince someone that did not going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to burn it.</v>

1544
01:11:45.830 --> 01:11:48.090
<v Speaker 1>Don't burn close too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

1545
01:11:48.091 --> 01:11:49.200
<v Speaker 1>That the Suntan stuff.</v>

1546
01:11:49.230 --> 01:11:50.063
<v Speaker 1>How long do you touch them with it for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know enough in an ordinary person </v>

1547
01:11:52.351 --> 01:11:53.880
<v Speaker 1>that up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I call bullshit.</v>

1548
01:11:54.510 --> 01:11:55.890
<v Speaker 1>I call bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we'll try it.</v>

1549
01:11:56.640 --> 01:12:00.410
<v Speaker 1>Let's try it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll get you under cook your hand.</v>

1550
01:12:00.510 --> 01:12:01.710
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's hot.</v>

1551
01:12:01.730 --> 01:12:03.630
<v Speaker 1>If it's hot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna fuck you up now.</v>

1552
01:12:03.690 --> 01:12:06.470
<v Speaker 1>Well I think if it's held there long </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough so like,</v>

1553
01:12:06.770 --> 01:12:09.090
<v Speaker 1>like it's one of those things like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>walking on coals to.</v>

1554
01:12:09.091 --> 01:12:09.924
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which I've done a number of times I'm </v>

1555
01:12:11.311 --> 01:12:12.860
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if it's cold,</v>

1556
01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:15.960
<v Speaker 1>you know this then that coles are not a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very good conductor of heat,</v>

1557
01:12:15.961 --> 01:12:19.080
<v Speaker 1>which is why you don't Cook Bullshit </v>
<v Speaker 1>because.</v>

1558
01:12:19.150 --> 01:12:22.520
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you what my experience was I.</v>

1559
01:12:22.650 --> 01:12:23.483
<v Speaker 1>The first time I tried it a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was with a group of maybe 40 people </v>

1560
01:12:27.450 --> 01:12:31.950
<v Speaker 1>and it was a standard length of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>firework was about 12 feet.</v>

1561
01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:34.260
<v Speaker 1>It was a hot fire was mosquito.</v>

1562
01:12:34.290 --> 01:12:37.560
<v Speaker 1>It was in my yard in Tucson and the guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>came in,</v>

1563
01:12:37.561 --> 01:12:38.394
<v Speaker 1>it was early in the days of firewalking </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he had this long for our thing to </v>

1564
01:12:42.241 --> 01:12:44.430
<v Speaker 1>get people ready.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1565
01:12:44.670 --> 01:12:45.503
<v Speaker 1>I was not in the right mental state when</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did it and my experience was it felt </v>

1566
01:12:49.261 --> 01:12:52.530
<v Speaker 1>fucking hot and then it got to the end </v>
<v Speaker 1>of it,</v>

1567
01:12:52.910 --> 01:12:56.610
<v Speaker 1>the condensed down to a number of points</v>
<v Speaker 1>that really burned.</v>

1568
01:12:56.611 --> 01:13:00.630
<v Speaker 1>And I had listeners the next day and </v>
<v Speaker 1>most people that have walked that night,</v>

1569
01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:03.150
<v Speaker 1>it looked like they were not in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right mental state,</v>

1570
01:13:03.151 --> 01:13:06.360
<v Speaker 1>but I saw a few people who strolled </v>
<v Speaker 1>across it that looked.</v>

1571
01:13:06.361 --> 01:13:08.340
<v Speaker 1>They were in some interesting altered </v>
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>

1572
01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:10.830
<v Speaker 1>So I wanted to try it again next time I </v>
<v Speaker 1>did it,</v>

1573
01:13:10.831 --> 01:13:13.650
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't have done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was with a guy who was a real jerk who</v>

1574
01:13:13.651 --> 01:13:17.010
<v Speaker 1>thought of himself as a self styled grew</v>
<v Speaker 1>small group.</v>

1575
01:13:17.010 --> 01:13:21.000
<v Speaker 1>It was a shorter maybe eight foot cooler</v>
<v Speaker 1>bed of coals.</v>

1576
01:13:21.270 --> 01:13:25.080
<v Speaker 1>And I got significant burns from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like an annoying guru.</v>

1577
01:13:25.081 --> 01:13:28.880
<v Speaker 1>So it's really annoying saying no idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>what he was like,</v>

1578
01:13:28.890 --> 01:13:29.723
<v Speaker 1>this guy's a jerk off and then you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting annoyed so you're out of your </v>

1579
01:13:31.741 --> 01:13:32.820
<v Speaker 1>mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1580
01:13:32.821 --> 01:13:35.250
<v Speaker 1>And I burned my feet so I said I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to do this again.</v>

1581
01:13:35.251 --> 01:13:39.440
<v Speaker 1>And then a friend of mine was doing some</v>
<v Speaker 1>intensive workshop with Tony Robbins and</v>

1582
01:13:39.900 --> 01:13:40.733
<v Speaker 1>Christ and it was going to end the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>day they were going to do try to set a </v>

1583
01:13:44.131 --> 01:13:46.740
<v Speaker 1>record for the longest firewalk done in </v>
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>

1584
01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:48.870
<v Speaker 1>So he wanted me to come up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I went up there,</v>

1585
01:13:48.871 --> 01:13:50.760
<v Speaker 1>I thought I'm going to watch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to do it.</v>

1586
01:13:50.970 --> 01:13:51.803
<v Speaker 1>So it was a 40 foot bed of coals and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was really odd and he had like a troupe </v>

1587
01:13:56.491 --> 01:13:58.710
<v Speaker 1>of African drummers and people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>dancing and drumming.</v>

1588
01:13:58.711 --> 01:14:02.850
<v Speaker 1>It was like midnight and people were </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting in line to walk and I said,</v>

1589
01:14:02.851 --> 01:14:03.684
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not going to be by family self going up </v>

1590
01:14:05.251 --> 01:14:06.084
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was right there and he taps me on </v>

1591
01:14:06.991 --> 01:14:08.130
<v Speaker 1>the shoulder and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're ready.</v>

1592
01:14:08.910 --> 01:14:12.400
<v Speaker 1>It felt like walking through crunchy </v>
<v Speaker 1>croutons.</v>

1593
01:14:12.430 --> 01:14:15.250
<v Speaker 2>There was no sensation of heat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I walked slowly,</v>

1594
01:14:15.251 --> 01:14:18.760
<v Speaker 2>I kind of wiggled my feet in the things </v>
<v Speaker 2>and when I got to the end of it,</v>

1595
01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:20.073
<v Speaker 2>I felt so high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like I want to ask that I had </v>

1596
01:14:22.211 --> 01:14:25.480
<v Speaker 2>energy rushes through my body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had nothing on my feet,</v>

1597
01:14:25.780 --> 01:14:28.390
<v Speaker 2>so on a much shorter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cooler walk.</v>

1598
01:14:28.391 --> 01:14:32.500
<v Speaker 2>Those coals conducted just fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then this one,</v>

1599
01:14:32.590 --> 01:14:33.423
<v Speaker 2>it's a mind body thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not about the conductivity of the </v>

1600
01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:39.690
<v Speaker 2>Tony Robbins hitting you with some for </v>
<v Speaker 2>gazy coals hot.</v>

1601
01:14:40.270 --> 01:14:42.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean you could barely get at the edge </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the thing.</v>

1602
01:14:42.421 --> 01:14:43.500
<v Speaker 2>Men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the heat was amazing.</v>

1603
01:14:43.540 --> 01:14:44.373
<v Speaker 2>He know the Tony Robbins one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's what's really interesting is </v>

1604
01:14:47.110 --> 01:14:51.130
<v Speaker 2>recently they've developed this issue </v>
<v Speaker 2>with people trying to take selfies while</v>

1605
01:14:51.131 --> 01:14:53.440
<v Speaker 2>they're walking across the coals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>burning their feet.</v>

1606
01:14:54.100 --> 01:14:54.933
<v Speaker 2>It's become a significant issue because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it didn't happen till like within the </v>

1607
01:14:58.440 --> 01:14:59.320
<v Speaker 2>last night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never heard of that.</v>

1608
01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:02.140
<v Speaker 2>I think that would get you right out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the proper state.</v>

1609
01:15:02.141 --> 01:15:03.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a big article about it.</v>

1610
01:15:04.570 --> 01:15:09.570
<v Speaker 2>Article about these people really </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking their feet up well deserved.</v>

1611
01:15:10.370 --> 01:15:15.370
<v Speaker 2>You really think that you have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ability to mitigate the amount of effect</v>

1612
01:15:15.641 --> 01:15:16.474
<v Speaker 2>that fire and Cole hot coals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any proof of this is my </v>

1613
01:15:19.991 --> 01:15:22.480
<v Speaker 2>intuition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what happens if your mind is out</v>

1614
01:15:22.481 --> 01:15:23.314
<v Speaker 2>of the way you can take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can absorb energy and let it flow </v>

1615
01:15:28.091 --> 01:15:28.924
<v Speaker 2>through your body rather than getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>blocked in the tissues where it causes </v>

1616
01:15:32.201 --> 01:15:33.034
<v Speaker 2>damage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've seen this in other situations </v>

1617
01:15:35.111 --> 01:15:35.944
<v Speaker 2>as well and I think the problem is </v>
<v Speaker 2>ordinarily our mind is in the way of </v>

1618
01:15:39.071 --> 01:15:41.680
<v Speaker 2>that and does not let the body freely do</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1619
01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:46.540
<v Speaker 2>And I think that applies to things like </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting hit really hard,</v>

1620
01:15:46.810 --> 01:15:49.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heat getting hit really hard.</v>

1621
01:15:49.241 --> 01:15:50.074
<v Speaker 2>How,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean?</v>

1622
01:15:50.980 --> 01:15:51.813
<v Speaker 2>Getting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>letting someone hit you as hard as they </v>

1623
01:15:53.351 --> 01:15:55.960
<v Speaker 2>can with something that would cause </v>
<v Speaker 2>damage and that doesn't.</v>

1624
01:15:56.020 --> 01:15:57.070
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>

1625
01:15:57.220 --> 01:15:57.941
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>

1626
01:15:57.941 --> 01:15:59.540
<v Speaker 2>I've experienced it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1627
01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:00.593
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But are there other real scientific </v>

1628
01:16:02.081 --> 01:16:04.030
<v Speaker 2>studies that show that nobody's studied </v>
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>

1629
01:16:04.031 --> 01:16:06.350
<v Speaker 2>I'd love to study.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's studied firewalking,</v>

1630
01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:07.233
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the usual scientific explanations like </v>

1631
01:16:08.710 --> 01:16:09.543
<v Speaker 2>we probably shouldn't talk about this </v>
<v Speaker 2>until they do do studies because it </v>

1632
01:16:11.531 --> 01:16:15.100
<v Speaker 2>seems so simple to do these studies and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not fighting for a second.</v>

1633
01:16:15.101 --> 01:16:17.680
<v Speaker 2>I think if I hit somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to fucking hurt.</v>

1634
01:16:18.250 --> 01:16:20.650
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you get deontay wilder to punch you,</v>

1635
01:16:20.651 --> 01:16:21.484
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a fuck how much Tony </v>
<v Speaker 2>Robbins talks to you and common </v>

1636
01:16:24.161 --> 01:16:24.994
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A drunk involved in car accidents don't </v>

1637
01:16:28.511 --> 01:16:29.380
<v Speaker 2>get injured.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1638
01:16:29.381 --> 01:16:31.720
<v Speaker 2>but do you know why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they're totally relaxed.</v>

1639
01:16:31.721 --> 01:16:32.554
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that has nothing to do at some </v>

1640
01:16:33.671 --> 01:16:34.504
<v Speaker 2>altered state of consciousness is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>allowing the injury to actually map out </v>

1641
01:16:37.811 --> 01:16:40.090
<v Speaker 2>of the way and their body is totally </v>
<v Speaker 2>relaxed,</v>

1642
01:16:40.091 --> 01:16:42.880
<v Speaker 2>so that's the tension of falling you.</v>

1643
01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:45.880
<v Speaker 2>You hurt yourself because you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>defending yourself.</v>

1644
01:16:45.881 --> 01:16:47.630
<v Speaker 2>You're right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right you.</v>

1645
01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:48.473
<v Speaker 2>Your body is better off giving in to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>old saying it's the same thing with the </v>

1646
01:16:52.570 --> 01:16:53.860
<v Speaker 2>fire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it can't be.</v>

1647
01:16:53.861 --> 01:16:55.650
<v Speaker 2>That's a different thing because you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>

1648
01:16:56.110 --> 01:16:56.943
<v Speaker 2>It's on the surface of your skin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is causing the heat tense in your </v>

1649
01:17:01.181 --> 01:17:02.014
<v Speaker 2>nervous system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is not letting not able to absorb </v>

1650
01:17:04.270 --> 01:17:06.790
<v Speaker 2>that thermal energy and Brown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to do studies.</v>

1651
01:17:07.210 --> 01:17:11.210
<v Speaker 2>Burn you anytime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll try it,</v>

1652
01:17:12.210 --> 01:17:13.760
<v Speaker 2>buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just.</v>

1653
01:17:13.910 --> 01:17:18.650
<v Speaker 2>I think there's certainly you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>mitigate the sensation of pain.</v>

1654
01:17:18.651 --> 01:17:23.330
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe that you can do anything</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the actual physiological change to</v>

1655
01:17:23.331 --> 01:17:27.020
<v Speaker 2>a hot piece of metal interacting with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the tissue of your skin.</v>

1656
01:17:27.021 --> 01:17:30.530
<v Speaker 2>I just think that like the steak does </v>
<v Speaker 2>not know it's being cooked.</v>

1657
01:17:30.830 --> 01:17:33.050
<v Speaker 2>It's just getting cooked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to get cooked.</v>

1658
01:17:33.051 --> 01:17:34.940
<v Speaker 2>You are a meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't.</v>

1659
01:17:34.940 --> 01:17:35.773
<v Speaker 2>I don't buy that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll show you some of these studies on </v>

1660
01:17:37.581 --> 01:17:39.650
<v Speaker 2>hypnosis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's doctors right now going,</v>

1661
01:17:39.651 --> 01:17:41.510
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You tell them Joe Rogan.</v>

1662
01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:43.910
<v Speaker 2>This is nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1663
01:17:43.911 --> 01:17:46.010
<v Speaker 2>I believe hypnosis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do believe that,</v>

1664
01:17:46.011 --> 01:17:46.844
<v Speaker 2>but I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I absolutely believe you can achieve </v>

1665
01:17:48.141 --> 01:17:51.860
<v Speaker 2>different states of mind where you feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>things differently.</v>

1666
01:17:51.870 --> 01:17:54.080
<v Speaker 2>Your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your concentration,</v>

1667
01:17:54.170 --> 01:17:57.980
<v Speaker 2>your relaxation is in a different state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your mind set is in a different state.</v>

1668
01:17:58.130 --> 01:17:58.963
<v Speaker 2>I do not believe that you can change the</v>
<v Speaker 2>physiological nature of your body's </v>

1669
01:18:02.121 --> 01:18:05.030
<v Speaker 2>ability to absorb punishment like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>punch or kick.</v>

1670
01:18:05.100 --> 01:18:08.240
<v Speaker 2>I do that same thing of absorbing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sun.</v>

1671
01:18:08.300 --> 01:18:11.070
<v Speaker 2>Let's set some studies up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

1672
01:18:12.870 --> 01:18:14.210
<v Speaker 2>How are we going to make these tests?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1673
01:18:14.211 --> 01:18:15.280
<v Speaker 2>I'll have to figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll talk.</v>

1674
01:18:15.340 --> 01:18:17.350
<v Speaker 2>If they're doing this forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you not know?</v>

1675
01:18:17.370 --> 01:18:18.203
<v Speaker 2>This should be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should have these studies already </v>

1676
01:18:19.401 --> 01:18:22.710
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to talk about these things to do.</v>

1677
01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:23.593
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is a significant icon rotation </v>

1678
01:18:25.550 --> 01:18:26.383
<v Speaker 2>point because if it's proven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is really huge and if you could </v>

1679
01:18:28.941 --> 01:18:29.774
<v Speaker 2>really take off hot metal rod that right</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of the fire and touch someone's </v>

1680
01:18:33.171 --> 01:18:34.430
<v Speaker 2>skin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're in the right state of mind.</v>

1681
01:18:34.431 --> 01:18:37.220
<v Speaker 2>You don't burn them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be giant.</v>

1682
01:18:37.250 --> 01:18:39.770
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am coming here with you.</v>

1683
01:18:39.890 --> 01:18:43.350
<v Speaker 2>I'll send you some literature on </v>
<v Speaker 2>hypnosis that shows this kind of.</v>

1684
01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:45.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure that someone wrote some shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

1685
01:18:46.310 --> 01:18:48.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure I want to see actual real </v>
<v Speaker 2>studies.</v>

1686
01:18:49.190 --> 01:18:51.290
<v Speaker 2>I want to see and I want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean in this day and age,</v>

1687
01:18:51.291 --> 01:18:54.110
<v Speaker 2>there's no reason not videotape,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's true.</v>

1688
01:18:54.230 --> 01:18:54.970
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

1689
01:18:54.970 --> 01:18:59.320
<v Speaker 2>so a lot of stuff to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a big one though because this is</v>

1690
01:18:59.330 --> 01:19:00.163
<v Speaker 2>something that will will people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right healers and you know a lot a lot </v>

1691
01:19:03.550 --> 01:19:08.550
<v Speaker 2>of people like to bring up and when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>press them on it there's no evidence for</v>

1692
01:19:08.631 --> 01:19:11.000
<v Speaker 2>it and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well anecdotal evidence.</v>

1693
01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:11.833
<v Speaker 2>Well I've heard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I work with a healer and he tells </v>

1694
01:19:14.061 --> 01:19:15.080
<v Speaker 2>me like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1695
01:19:16.220 --> 01:19:19.390
<v Speaker 2>do you know what the literal meaning of </v>
<v Speaker 2>anecdote is?</v>

1696
01:19:19.730 --> 01:19:21.770
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It means unpublished in Greek.</v>

1697
01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:25.070
<v Speaker 2>It does not mean stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not worth paying attention to.</v>

1698
01:19:25.071 --> 01:19:27.410
<v Speaker 2>Anecdotal evidence is often actually so </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it.</v>

1699
01:19:27.500 --> 01:19:29.810
<v Speaker 2>And it inspires you to do the </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiments.</v>

1700
01:19:29.811 --> 01:19:30.644
<v Speaker 2>So will you go ahead and do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll report that hot piece of metal on </v>

1701
01:19:34.871 --> 01:19:36.380
<v Speaker 2>your report back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1702
01:19:36.460 --> 01:19:39.710
<v Speaker 2>And I'm going to go look at that burn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll report back to you.</v>

1703
01:19:39.770 --> 01:19:40.603
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm not saying that anecdotal </v>

1704
01:19:41.811 --> 01:19:45.680
<v Speaker 2>evidence is always inaccurate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's most certainly accurate many times.</v>

1705
01:19:45.710 --> 01:19:46.820
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes.</v>

1706
01:19:46.850 --> 01:19:47.683
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just his likelihood that it's not that </v>

1707
01:19:49.731 --> 01:19:52.490
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but anecdotal enough is what gives you a</v>

1708
01:19:52.650 --> 01:19:54.110
<v Speaker 2>hypothesis test.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1709
01:19:54.140 --> 01:19:54.973
<v Speaker 2>But it's just not good enough to stay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when something that doesn't </v>

1710
01:19:58.251 --> 01:20:01.190
<v Speaker 2>make sense chemically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Physiologically.</v>

1711
01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:01.450
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

1712
01:20:01.450 --> 01:20:02.283
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I told you about my experience with </v>

1713
01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:06.860
<v Speaker 2>Sun Tan that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that make sense?</v>

1714
01:20:06.861 --> 01:20:09.050
<v Speaker 2>It the Europe trip and your balls off </v>
<v Speaker 2>and.</v>

1715
01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:11.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And something happened in my body.</v>

1716
01:20:11.490 --> 01:20:15.360
<v Speaker 2>That would be interesting if that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of interchange and your body's</v>

1717
01:20:15.361 --> 01:20:17.120
<v Speaker 2>ability to produce melanin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1718
01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:18.560
<v Speaker 2>Or what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Melancholy.</v>

1719
01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:19.433
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you say?</v>

1720
01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:21.330
<v Speaker 2>Atlanta,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Atlanta sites sites.</v>

1721
01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:26.900
<v Speaker 2>So your and they're controlled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're sites are related to neurons and</v>

1722
01:20:28.300 --> 01:20:31.450
<v Speaker 2>they're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're influenced by nerve connection.</v>

1723
01:20:31.451 --> 01:20:32.284
<v Speaker 2>So it seems to be perfectly possible </v>
<v Speaker 2>that mind through the nervous system </v>

1724
01:20:35.281 --> 01:20:36.114
<v Speaker 2>changes the behavior Mylanta sites.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sort of like how your body can ramp up </v>

1725
01:20:40.081 --> 01:20:44.420
<v Speaker 2>adrenaline or anxiety or any also can </v>
<v Speaker 2>ramp up melana sites.</v>

1726
01:20:44.490 --> 01:20:45.323
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't seem like outside of the </v>

1727
01:20:46.711 --> 01:20:49.650
<v Speaker 2>realm of possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That seems like obviously some people.</v>

1728
01:20:49.651 --> 01:20:50.484
<v Speaker 2>When I first told it to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you said it was outside the realm of </v>

1729
01:20:52.141 --> 01:20:52.830
<v Speaker 2>possibility.</v>

1730
01:20:52.830 --> 01:20:54.570
<v Speaker 2>Not outside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sounds crazy.</v>

1731
01:20:55.030 --> 01:20:55.863
<v Speaker 2>Definitely sounds crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean it seems like that would be </v>

1732
01:20:57.991 --> 01:21:00.210
<v Speaker 2>something also that would really warrant</v>
<v Speaker 2>study.</v>

1733
01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:01.073
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially those poor pastey ass </v>

1734
01:21:02.641 --> 01:21:07.260
<v Speaker 2>motherfuckers out there on the beach </v>
<v Speaker 2>turning bright red like,</v>

1735
01:21:07.261 --> 01:21:08.760
<v Speaker 2>come man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just got to think about it the right</v>

1736
01:21:08.761 --> 01:21:09.594
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You imagine if you just told people it </v>

1737
01:21:11.680 --> 01:21:14.610
<v Speaker 2>was like a meditation and then you just </v>
<v Speaker 2>get a nice Tan.</v>

1738
01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:16.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good thing.</v>

1739
01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:17.873
<v Speaker 2>It would be a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now when it comes to like we were </v>

1740
01:21:20.161 --> 01:21:22.290
<v Speaker 2>talking about autoimmune issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>

1741
01:21:22.630 --> 01:21:23.580
<v Speaker 2>I have video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

1742
01:21:23.581 --> 01:21:27.180
<v Speaker 2>you see spots on my hands where I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>get any pigment.</v>

1743
01:21:27.540 --> 01:21:29.040
<v Speaker 2>How do I fix that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fix that.</v>

1744
01:21:29.041 --> 01:21:30.930
<v Speaker 2>My brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1745
01:21:30.931 --> 01:21:31.764
<v Speaker 2>all I can tell you is I would try to see</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you an influence through hypnosis or </v>

1746
01:21:35.701 --> 01:21:37.950
<v Speaker 2>through guided imagery to see if you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>change it in any way.</v>

1747
01:21:37.950 --> 01:21:40.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hypnosis and guided imagery.</v>

1748
01:21:40.021 --> 01:21:42.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are two mind body techniques.</v>

1749
01:21:42.091 --> 01:21:47.091
<v Speaker 2>I think it's worth trying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did read once that there was this,</v>

1750
01:21:47.940 --> 01:21:48.773
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a young man who had some </v>
<v Speaker 2>awful one of those awful war diseases </v>

1751
01:21:55.320 --> 01:21:56.153
<v Speaker 2>and there was one called theosis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like the whole covered with </v>

1752
01:21:59.461 --> 01:22:02.940
<v Speaker 2>this callous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tarred tissue and it went away.</v>

1753
01:22:03.190 --> 01:22:04.350
<v Speaker 2>Hit Moses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1754
01:22:04.470 --> 01:22:06.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Over time I burned that case too.</v>

1755
01:22:06.750 --> 01:22:07.583
<v Speaker 2>They told him that like his arm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that one arm was going to be cured and </v>

1756
01:22:11.881 --> 01:22:13.740
<v Speaker 2>it just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember that lately.</v>

1757
01:22:13.860 --> 01:22:16.350
<v Speaker 2>Eliminated all the warts on that one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember that.</v>

1758
01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:17.633
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they couldn't figure out how or why </v>

1759
01:22:19.351 --> 01:22:20.184
<v Speaker 2>and they couldn't recreate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the ward stuff that's very well </v>

1760
01:22:23.521 --> 01:22:27.360
<v Speaker 2>documented and work cures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so many different work.</v>

1761
01:22:27.361 --> 01:22:28.800
<v Speaker 2>Who are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of them are quite funny.</v>

1762
01:22:29.030 --> 01:22:29.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1763
01:22:29.730 --> 01:22:30.563
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to,</v>

1764
01:22:30.670 --> 01:22:31.850
<v Speaker 2>you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1765
01:22:32.260 --> 01:22:33.093
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a particular plant under the full moon </v>

1766
01:22:35.251 --> 01:22:38.700
<v Speaker 2>and Robin and barry above the falls off </v>
<v Speaker 2>the next morning.</v>

1767
01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:42.300
<v Speaker 2>And when you compare that to the way we </v>
<v Speaker 2>deal with warts medically,</v>

1768
01:22:42.301 --> 01:22:43.830
<v Speaker 2>we burned them off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>freeze them off,</v>

1769
01:22:43.831 --> 01:22:46.140
<v Speaker 2>cut them off in most of the time when we</v>
<v Speaker 2>do that,</v>

1770
01:22:46.141 --> 01:22:48.980
<v Speaker 2>they grow back and multiple clusters </v>
<v Speaker 2>when they got,</v>

1771
01:22:49.140 --> 01:22:51.660
<v Speaker 2>when the mind gets rid of them through </v>
<v Speaker 2>this method,</v>

1772
01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:52.553
<v Speaker 2>they're gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we want to find out how to make that </v>

1773
01:22:54.271 --> 01:22:55.920
<v Speaker 2>happen more than fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1774
01:22:56.070 --> 01:22:57.210
<v Speaker 2>that's real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1775
01:22:57.211 --> 01:22:59.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is actual real documented science.</v>

1776
01:23:00.450 --> 01:23:04.350
<v Speaker 2>That is what is so interesting to me </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the placebo effect is that it is a</v>

1777
01:23:04.351 --> 01:23:05.184
<v Speaker 2>real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that your mind has this capability of </v>

1778
01:23:07.721 --> 01:23:11.140
<v Speaker 2>healing itself in this very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very powerful way,</v>

1779
01:23:11.350 --> 01:23:13.990
<v Speaker 2>but we don't exactly know how to turn it</v>
<v Speaker 2>on or off.</v>

1780
01:23:14.110 --> 01:23:16.660
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it can do the opposite too.</v>

1781
01:23:16.661 --> 01:23:18.790
<v Speaker 2>There's a phenomenon called Voodoo </v>
<v Speaker 2>death.</v>

1782
01:23:18.820 --> 01:23:23.320
<v Speaker 2>We're in societies where there which Dr </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sherman's a malevolent,</v>

1783
01:23:23.321 --> 01:23:26.530
<v Speaker 2>which Dr can curse a person and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>person goes home,</v>

1784
01:23:26.531 --> 01:23:27.920
<v Speaker 2>lies in bed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stops eating,</v>

1785
01:23:27.940 --> 01:23:30.740
<v Speaker 2>and over days or weeks dies will.</v>

1786
01:23:30.790 --> 01:23:34.540
<v Speaker 2>So what more could you ask of in the way</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a mind body effect?</v>

1787
01:23:34.541 --> 01:23:35.374
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he put a curse on what was the </v>

1788
01:23:36.011 --> 01:23:39.760
<v Speaker 2>basketball team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were talking shit about them.</v>

1789
01:23:40.150 --> 01:23:43.870
<v Speaker 2>Put a curse on them and they couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>win a Goddamn game in a few times.</v>

1790
01:23:43.930 --> 01:23:45.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's put a curse on a few different to,</v>

1791
01:23:45.871 --> 01:23:46.704
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like a real,</v>

1792
01:23:47.350 --> 01:23:48.970
<v Speaker 2>how would you say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Spiritual.</v>

1793
01:23:48.971 --> 01:23:52.690
<v Speaker 2>Very positive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mostly like real love oriented guy.</v>

1794
01:23:52.691 --> 01:23:56.500
<v Speaker 2>But occasionally I'll put a hex on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>dude and when he puts a hex on,</v>

1795
01:23:56.501 --> 01:23:57.334
<v Speaker 2>you got a real problem on your heart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apparently it's been very effective and </v>

1796
01:24:00.521 --> 01:24:04.580
<v Speaker 2>people freak out when Lil B Hex Ism </v>
<v Speaker 2>little b puts that hex on you,</v>

1797
01:24:04.590 --> 01:24:05.423
<v Speaker 2>like dammit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he releases the Hex is lifted </v>

1798
01:24:07.661 --> 01:24:09.120
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He lifts the Huh.</v>

1799
01:24:09.190 --> 01:24:11.770
<v Speaker 2>And when he lifts them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything goes back to normal.</v>

1800
01:24:11.830 --> 01:24:13.360
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is weird,</v>

1801
01:24:13.361 --> 01:24:14.194
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is like a weird because everyone's </v>

1802
01:24:16.361 --> 01:24:19.700
<v Speaker 2>aware when he puts a curse on you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

1803
01:24:19.701 --> 01:24:21.250
<v Speaker 2>when he does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are gone.</v>

1804
01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:23.140
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe this.</v>

1805
01:24:24.190 --> 01:24:26.620
<v Speaker 2>Like the idea of curses like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1806
01:24:26.650 --> 01:24:29.560
<v Speaker 2>the Voodoo curse or a gypsy curse on </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1807
01:24:29.561 --> 01:24:30.394
<v Speaker 2>That is a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's the negative side effects </v>

1808
01:24:31.741 --> 01:24:34.120
<v Speaker 2>that it has a name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called the no cbo effect.</v>

1809
01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:37.240
<v Speaker 2>Noxious rather than pleasing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1810
01:24:37.900 --> 01:24:40.660
<v Speaker 2>That is um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a documented thing as well,</v>

1811
01:24:40.661 --> 01:24:41.494
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That people can believe that something </v>

1812
01:24:42.871 --> 01:24:45.030
<v Speaker 2>is wrong with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they start mine.</v>

1813
01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:46.273
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking themselves into this terrible </v>

1814
01:24:47.561 --> 01:24:50.200
<v Speaker 2>state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they start screwing things up.</v>

1815
01:24:50.260 --> 01:24:51.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1816
01:24:51.340 --> 01:24:52.570
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hot started.</v>

1817
01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:54.220
<v Speaker 2>Here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kevin Duran says,</v>

1818
01:24:54.221 --> 01:24:57.020
<v Speaker 2>I tried to listen to little b.</v>
<v Speaker 2>my mind wouldn't let me do it.</v>

1819
01:24:57.021 --> 01:25:00.770
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe this guy's relevant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was like,</v>

1820
01:25:00.890 --> 01:25:01.723
<v Speaker 2>okay bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kevin Durant will never win the title </v>

1821
01:25:04.061 --> 01:25:07.360
<v Speaker 2>after he said Lil B as a whack wrapper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the base,</v>

1822
01:25:07.370 --> 01:25:10.000
<v Speaker 2>God's curse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hashtag the base.</v>

1823
01:25:10.001 --> 01:25:15.001
<v Speaker 2>God's curse on direct and then he always</v>
<v Speaker 2>signs his tweets will be funny,</v>

1824
01:25:18.190 --> 01:25:19.810
<v Speaker 2>but it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It works.</v>

1825
01:25:19.811 --> 01:25:20.644
<v Speaker 2>Kevin Doran is sitting at home right now</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking of the millions that must have </v>

1826
01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:23.633
<v Speaker 2>cost is one now one now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he could have bought a house with </v>

1827
01:25:26.951 --> 01:25:31.330
<v Speaker 2>all that money lost those years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A little be fucked over in a corner.</v>

1828
01:25:34.860 --> 01:25:36.130
<v Speaker 2>But that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1829
01:25:36.131 --> 01:25:39.310
<v Speaker 2>I think the opposite is true too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So somebody could put blessings on you.</v>

1830
01:25:39.311 --> 01:25:41.980
<v Speaker 2>Like there was a fighter that we had in </v>
<v Speaker 2>here the other day,</v>

1831
01:25:41.981 --> 01:25:44.350
<v Speaker 2>deontay wilder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the WBC heavyweight champion of the</v>

1832
01:25:44.351 --> 01:25:45.184
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said that from the time he was a </v>

1833
01:25:47.111 --> 01:25:47.944
<v Speaker 2>little boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his grandmother had him convinced that </v>

1834
01:25:49.631 --> 01:25:50.464
<v Speaker 2>he was like an anointed one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he was special and that she would </v>

1835
01:25:53.321 --> 01:25:55.570
<v Speaker 2>always say that to his parents like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1836
01:25:55.571 --> 01:25:57.970
<v Speaker 2>don't you hit him like this one's </v>
<v Speaker 2>special,</v>

1837
01:25:58.300 --> 01:25:58.931
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's gonna,</v>

1838
01:25:58.931 --> 01:26:01.990
<v Speaker 2>raise everybody up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he turned out to be like one of</v>

1839
01:26:01.991 --> 01:26:04.340
<v Speaker 2>the greatest heavyweight champions ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>in terms of like his record.</v>

1840
01:26:04.341 --> 01:26:05.174
<v Speaker 2>He's 40 now with 39 knockouts and he's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>phenomenally successful fighter and in </v>

1841
01:26:09.321 --> 01:26:10.154
<v Speaker 2>his mind he believes that he has some </v>
<v Speaker 2>like magic property or that there's </v>

1842
01:26:15.081 --> 01:26:18.080
<v Speaker 2>something to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a ridiculous knockout artist to me.</v>

1843
01:26:18.110 --> 01:26:21.110
<v Speaker 2>Obviously there's a lot of physiological</v>
<v Speaker 2>aspects of that and he's a big,</v>

1844
01:26:21.350 --> 01:26:24.140
<v Speaker 2>long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tall guy with crazy knockout power.</v>

1845
01:26:24.390 --> 01:26:26.450
<v Speaker 2>You can't fake power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You either have it or you don't,</v>

1846
01:26:26.810 --> 01:26:30.260
<v Speaker 2>but he's got it and he's got this weird </v>
<v Speaker 2>confidence too.</v>

1847
01:26:30.261 --> 01:26:31.094
<v Speaker 2>And you gotta wonder how much of them </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually is operating under this idea </v>

1848
01:26:34.191 --> 01:26:38.160
<v Speaker 2>that his grandmother was right about him</v>
<v Speaker 2>having some magical properties.</v>

1849
01:26:38.161 --> 01:26:40.070
<v Speaker 2>And so he goes through life that this </v>
<v Speaker 2>vision.</v>

1850
01:26:40.330 --> 01:26:41.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Powerful.</v>

1851
01:26:41.900 --> 01:26:42.733
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How you trick people into thinking that </v>

1852
01:26:44.481 --> 01:26:45.314
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole nation full of a dlt while </v>

1853
01:26:49.010 --> 01:26:49.843
<v Speaker 2>there's a nation full of doctors are </v>
<v Speaker 2>afraid of the placebo effect because </v>

1854
01:26:54.681 --> 01:26:56.780
<v Speaker 2>they think it's tricking people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keeping them.</v>

1855
01:26:57.230 --> 01:26:59.690
<v Speaker 2>And it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's you know when,</v>

1856
01:27:00.110 --> 01:27:02.120
<v Speaker 2>when you present a treatment to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>patient,</v>

1857
01:27:02.990 --> 01:27:07.970
<v Speaker 2>your belief in the treatment as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a practitioner catalyzes the patients</v>

1858
01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:08.873
<v Speaker 2>believe the best way I can do that as if</v>
<v Speaker 2>I give a patient something that I've </v>

1859
01:27:12.081 --> 01:27:12.914
<v Speaker 2>tried myself and I know from my own </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience that it works and then I can </v>

1860
01:27:16.071 --> 01:27:16.904
<v Speaker 2>present it in a way with my confidence </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that increases the patient's </v>

1861
01:27:19.761 --> 01:27:22.460
<v Speaker 2>confidence and increases the likelihood </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a favorable outcome.</v>

1862
01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:25.430
<v Speaker 2>Even controversial therapies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1863
01:27:25.431 --> 01:27:26.264
<v Speaker 2>and even Wayne example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something you see when you give a </v>

1864
01:27:28.910 --> 01:27:31.390
<v Speaker 2>pharmaceutical drug to a patient,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's,</v>

1865
01:27:31.650 --> 01:27:36.260
<v Speaker 2>there's the direct effect of the drug </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then there's a halo of belief effect</v>

1866
01:27:36.650 --> 01:27:37.483
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an interesting phenomenon is that </v>

1867
01:27:39.170 --> 01:27:40.003
<v Speaker 2>there's a famous saying in medicine that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should use a new remedy as much as </v>

1868
01:27:43.371 --> 01:27:45.500
<v Speaker 2>possible before it loses the power to </v>
<v Speaker 2>heal.</v>

1869
01:27:45.950 --> 01:27:46.783
<v Speaker 2>And this is a common experience that </v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs work best near the time of their </v>

1870
01:27:49.701 --> 01:27:52.150
<v Speaker 2>introduction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's also the case with diets as well.</v>

1871
01:27:52.220 --> 01:27:54.200
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the longer they're around,</v>

1872
01:27:54.290 --> 01:27:58.130
<v Speaker 2>what I think what happens is people have</v>
<v Speaker 2>faith in new things,</v>

1873
01:27:58.820 --> 01:28:03.530
<v Speaker 2>so there's a big halo of placebo effect </v>
<v Speaker 2>over time that shrinks and it leaves the</v>

1874
01:28:03.531 --> 01:28:05.660
<v Speaker 2>stuff on its own which may not be very </v>
<v Speaker 2>impressive.</v>

1875
01:28:05.661 --> 01:28:06.494
<v Speaker 2>This is often the case when people take </v>
<v Speaker 2>on a radical diet like on opposite ends </v>

1876
01:28:09.651 --> 01:28:10.484
<v Speaker 2>of the spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's a carnivore diet and aware </v>

1877
01:28:12.470 --> 01:28:16.820
<v Speaker 2>that a lot of people swear it fixed </v>
<v Speaker 2>Somalis Ales or Vegan Diet.</v>

1878
01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:19.430
<v Speaker 2>Very similar effects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously very different diet.</v>

1879
01:28:19.820 --> 01:28:22.280
<v Speaker 2>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's the mind.</v>

1880
01:28:22.370 --> 01:28:25.970
<v Speaker 2>The mind to mind is where it's at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do we,</v>

1881
01:28:26.330 --> 01:28:27.163
<v Speaker 2>how do we end?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The big problem in science and medicine </v>

1882
01:28:29.031 --> 01:28:30.920
<v Speaker 2>is that we don't believe in the mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1883
01:28:31.260 --> 01:28:33.140
<v Speaker 2>that's what I was saying earlier when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you were talking about mine.</v>

1884
01:28:33.141 --> 01:28:35.250
<v Speaker 2>It's not material.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>

1885
01:28:35.460 --> 01:28:38.060
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem when you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about mind,</v>

1886
01:28:38.061 --> 01:28:41.660
<v Speaker 2>body interactions or work curious </v>
<v Speaker 2>placebo effects,</v>

1887
01:28:41.900 --> 01:28:42.733
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about a an nonmaterial </v>
<v Speaker 2>cause of a physical event and that is </v>

1888
01:28:47.241 --> 01:28:51.560
<v Speaker 2>not allowed in the materialistic </v>
<v Speaker 2>paradigm that science,</v>

1889
01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:54.710
<v Speaker 2>when we observed a change in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>physical system,</v>

1890
01:28:55.400 --> 01:28:59.950
<v Speaker 2>the dog is the cause has to be physical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you talk about a nonphysical causes</v>

1891
01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:01.820
<v Speaker 2>a physical event,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientists to now,</v>

1892
01:29:02.190 --> 01:29:03.023
<v Speaker 1>well that's really unfortunate because </v>
<v Speaker 1>we know so much about how attitude does </v>

1893
01:29:06.781 --> 01:29:09.270
<v Speaker 1>shape the way your body reacts to </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1894
01:29:09.300 --> 01:29:10.890
<v Speaker 1>Going back to the SAR,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no stuff,</v>

1895
01:29:10.891 --> 01:29:14.370
<v Speaker 1>you know that with back pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff.</v>

1896
01:29:14.371 --> 01:29:18.780
<v Speaker 1>It's like you know that to me that the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't separate the mind and body.</v>

1897
01:29:18.781 --> 01:29:21.480
<v Speaker 1>There are two poles of the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1898
01:29:21.570 --> 01:29:24.120
<v Speaker 1>if the placebo effect is real and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>documented,</v>

1899
01:29:24.540 --> 01:29:25.373
<v Speaker 1>it's documented,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so obviously something is going on with </v>

1900
01:29:27.511 --> 01:29:28.344
<v Speaker 1>the way you feel about things and think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about things that it's having an actual </v>

1901
01:29:30.961 --> 01:29:33.540
<v Speaker 1>physiological effects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something happening to your body</v>

1902
01:29:33.541 --> 01:29:35.760
<v Speaker 1>because the way you're thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>are happening to your body.</v>

1903
01:29:35.790 --> 01:29:36.623
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that has made this </v>

1904
01:29:38.220 --> 01:29:39.053
<v Speaker 1>suddenly have interest in the medical </v>
<v Speaker 1>world is that we now have these </v>

1905
01:29:42.811 --> 01:29:46.200
<v Speaker 1>techniques like functional Mris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pet scans,</v>

1906
01:29:46.201 --> 01:29:47.034
<v Speaker 1>where we can observe living brains and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can show that the placebo response </v>

1907
01:29:50.811 --> 01:29:51.644
<v Speaker 1>is associated with particular activity </v>
<v Speaker 1>in certain brain centers that has made </v>

1908
01:29:54.421 --> 01:29:57.450
<v Speaker 1>it real for people that otherwise didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in it.</v>

1909
01:29:58.830 --> 01:29:59.850
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1910
01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:00.713
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a medically documented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something they actually get a </v>

1911
01:30:03.750 --> 01:30:05.140
<v Speaker 1>hook into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1912
01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:06.630
<v Speaker 1>you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can put it on a scale.</v>

1913
01:30:06.660 --> 01:30:07.471
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1914
01:30:07.471 --> 01:30:08.304
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What part of the brain is responsible </v>

1915
01:30:10.261 --> 01:30:11.640
<v Speaker 1>for the placebo effect?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1916
01:30:11.641 --> 01:30:12.474
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably some of these deep brain </v>

1917
01:30:13.921 --> 01:30:18.480
<v Speaker 1>centers that the same ones involved in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sweden and wearing the same thing.</v>

1918
01:30:18.481 --> 01:30:23.130
<v Speaker 1>It's coming from centers that connect to</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional read to emotion.</v>

1919
01:30:24.260 --> 01:30:25.093
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ability to turn that on off </v>

1920
01:30:26.671 --> 01:30:29.490
<v Speaker 1>consciously and willingly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is tricky.</v>

1921
01:30:29.700 --> 01:30:30.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1922
01:30:30.541 --> 01:30:31.374
<v Speaker 1>another thing I looked at over the years</v>
<v Speaker 1>was healing shrines in the world like </v>

1923
01:30:35.581 --> 01:30:36.414
<v Speaker 1>Lord the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's two interesting facts about </v>

1924
01:30:39.661 --> 01:30:40.980
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Over the years,</v>

1925
01:30:40.981 --> 01:30:41.814
<v Speaker 1>the Catholic Church has accepted very </v>
<v Speaker 1>few healings as genuine that or have </v>

1926
01:30:45.570 --> 01:30:48.540
<v Speaker 1>full medical documentation and some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them are quite spectacular,</v>

1927
01:30:48.541 --> 01:30:52.470
<v Speaker 1>like miraculous disappearance of widely </v>
<v Speaker 1>disseminated cancer.</v>

1928
01:30:53.040 --> 01:30:53.873
<v Speaker 1>No native of Lord has ever been cured </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the chances that a person that's </v>

1929
01:30:57.750 --> 01:30:59.700
<v Speaker 1>going to be healed there explained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lord,</v>

1930
01:30:59.940 --> 01:31:02.580
<v Speaker 1>this is a place as a place in France </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you know,</v>

1931
01:31:02.620 --> 01:31:03.670
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

1932
01:31:03.680 --> 01:31:04.471
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1933
01:31:04.471 --> 01:31:08.180
<v Speaker 1>a child saw visions of the Virgin Mary </v>
<v Speaker 1>and anyway,</v>

1934
01:31:08.480 --> 01:31:11.260
<v Speaker 1>growing up into a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a grotto and you know,</v>

1935
01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:12.273
<v Speaker 1>it's now a major Catholic drawing and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>has a reputation for healing and </v>

1936
01:31:15.450 --> 01:31:18.420
<v Speaker 1>thousands and thousands of people over </v>
<v Speaker 1>the years of going there.</v>

1937
01:31:18.630 --> 01:31:19.860
<v Speaker 1>So as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

1938
01:31:19.861 --> 01:31:20.694
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was relatively few reported </v>

1939
01:31:22.951 --> 01:31:25.200
<v Speaker 1>healings that had been docked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fully document medically,</v>

1940
01:31:25.201 --> 01:31:27.630
<v Speaker 1>but no native of Lord has ever been </v>
<v Speaker 1>healed.</v>

1941
01:31:27.930 --> 01:31:28.763
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something called the Lord </v>

1942
01:31:30.391 --> 01:31:31.224
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is fascinating that the chances </v>

1943
01:31:33.091 --> 01:31:33.924
<v Speaker 1>that a person is going to be healed at </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lord or a place like that is directly </v>

1944
01:31:37.261 --> 01:31:39.390
<v Speaker 1>proportional to the length of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>journey traveled.</v>

1945
01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:41.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have heard that.</v>

1946
01:31:41.850 --> 01:31:45.300
<v Speaker 1>So the length of the journey is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is an investment of belief,</v>

1947
01:31:45.301 --> 01:31:46.134
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're projecting belief onto the </v>

1948
01:31:47.431 --> 01:31:49.920
<v Speaker 1>plate place and then you get it back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1949
01:31:49.921 --> 01:31:53.340
<v Speaker 1>That that seems like that could </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially work with any very,</v>

1950
01:31:53.341 --> 01:31:54.174
<v Speaker 1>very difficult absolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quest types of experience that you're </v>

1951
01:31:56.971 --> 01:31:57.804
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're looking for something and you </v>

1952
01:31:59.201 --> 01:31:59.980
<v Speaker 1>have to earn it.</v>

1953
01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:02.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you have to be fully invested.</v>

1954
01:32:02.710 --> 01:32:03.543
<v Speaker 2>There has to be something going on in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the mind that has you convinced this is </v>

1955
01:32:05.441 --> 01:32:08.560
<v Speaker 2>a real effect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the power is not in the place.</v>

1956
01:32:08.561 --> 01:32:13.210
<v Speaker 2>The powers in here and you're projecting</v>
<v Speaker 2>it onto that.</v>

1957
01:32:13.480 --> 01:32:15.580
<v Speaker 2>But man wouldn't be better if you didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to go all the way.</v>

1958
01:32:15.800 --> 01:32:19.640
<v Speaker 2>That'd be great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how do you,</v>

1959
01:32:19.690 --> 01:32:23.110
<v Speaker 2>how do you get that going?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if someone said to you,</v>

1960
01:32:23.111 --> 01:32:24.520
<v Speaker 2>okay man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to go to the Lord,</v>

1961
01:32:24.521 --> 01:32:25.200
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1962
01:32:25.200 --> 01:32:26.980
<v Speaker 2>what should I do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1963
01:32:27.040 --> 01:32:29.320
<v Speaker 2>one is the acute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine you're going to Lord in.</v>

1964
01:32:29.321 --> 01:32:31.690
<v Speaker 2>That's taking advantage of this function</v>
<v Speaker 2>of visualization.</v>

1965
01:32:31.691 --> 01:32:32.524
<v Speaker 2>That's why these therapies like guided </v>
<v Speaker 2>imagery seem to work that you can </v>

1966
01:32:34.871 --> 01:32:38.770
<v Speaker 2>imagine something and have it become </v>
<v Speaker 2>real guided imagery.</v>

1967
01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:40.360
<v Speaker 2>Now is there a specific,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1968
01:32:40.361 --> 01:32:42.490
<v Speaker 2>like there's like transcendental </v>
<v Speaker 2>medication.</v>

1969
01:32:42.491 --> 01:32:44.110
<v Speaker 2>There's boots,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a formal,</v>

1970
01:32:44.111 --> 01:32:46.780
<v Speaker 2>it's a formal system of therapy that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are trained in.</v>

1971
01:32:46.810 --> 01:32:47.800
<v Speaker 2>Were you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1972
01:32:47.860 --> 01:32:48.693
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you sit with a practitioner and they </v>

1973
01:32:50.290 --> 01:32:51.123
<v Speaker 2>help you explore your mental imagery and</v>
<v Speaker 2>a May give you specific kinds of images </v>

1974
01:32:55.511 --> 01:32:58.510
<v Speaker 2>to work with depending on the condition </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're dealing with.</v>

1975
01:33:00.820 --> 01:33:04.270
<v Speaker 2>I would think knowing the fact that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>

1976
01:33:04.271 --> 01:33:06.550
<v Speaker 2>we have real evidence that placebo </v>
<v Speaker 2>effect works.</v>

1977
01:33:06.580 --> 01:33:11.230
<v Speaker 2>Why isn't there more study done to try </v>
<v Speaker 2>or more thought and more,</v>

1978
01:33:11.890 --> 01:33:12.723
<v Speaker 2>more people that are trying to emphasize</v>
<v Speaker 2>disability of the talent and we're up </v>

1979
01:33:17.021 --> 01:33:17.854
<v Speaker 2>against this problem that in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominant paradigm in science and </v>

1980
01:33:21.041 --> 01:33:21.874
<v Speaker 2>medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't believe in nonphysical </v>

1981
01:33:23.710 --> 01:33:27.250
<v Speaker 2>causation of physical events,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't jive with me because we</v>

1982
01:33:27.251 --> 01:33:29.740
<v Speaker 2>do believe in a placebo effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like everybody says that,</v>

1983
01:33:29.770 --> 01:33:31.000
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a placebo.</v>

1984
01:33:31.030 --> 01:33:32.260
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You said that earlier.</v>

1985
01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:34.660
<v Speaker 2>People always say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it still works.</v>

1986
01:33:35.110 --> 01:33:35.680
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1987
01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:37.560
<v Speaker 2>but we're not using it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1988
01:33:38.290 --> 01:33:39.880
<v Speaker 2>We should be using.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It should be used.</v>

1989
01:33:40.050 --> 01:33:40.883
<v Speaker 2>It's the meat of medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We want to make it happen more at the </v>

1990
01:33:43.361 --> 01:33:45.290
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God Damn it.</v>

1991
01:33:46.100 --> 01:33:48.280
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're so flawed in our approach.</v>

1992
01:33:48.281 --> 01:33:49.114
<v Speaker 2>It's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the human body and the human </v>

1993
01:33:51.821 --> 01:33:56.410
<v Speaker 2>mind is such an incredibly complicated </v>
<v Speaker 2>biological entity,</v>

1994
01:33:56.411 --> 01:33:57.040
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1995
01:33:57.040 --> 01:33:59.920
<v Speaker 2>Our ability to consciously be aware of </v>
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>

1996
01:34:00.370 --> 01:34:01.930
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our life,</v>

1997
01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:05.440
<v Speaker 2>our position in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our mortality,</v>

1998
01:34:05.470 --> 01:34:08.260
<v Speaker 2>the insignificance of us in the greater </v>
<v Speaker 2>scale.</v>

1999
01:34:08.261 --> 01:34:11.500
<v Speaker 2>All those things are like they are right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now all the time,</v>

2000
01:34:11.501 --> 01:34:14.160
<v Speaker 2>but you don't have any users manually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2001
01:34:14.170 --> 01:34:15.003
<v Speaker 2>We have this incredible machine that can</v>
<v Speaker 2>invent nuclear bombs and satellites and </v>

2002
01:34:19.030 --> 01:34:19.863
<v Speaker 2>there's no union users manual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no user's manual for the mind or the </v>

2003
01:34:22.631 --> 01:34:25.330
<v Speaker 2>body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially not in how to manage the body</v>

2004
01:34:25.331 --> 01:34:27.820
<v Speaker 2>with the mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing figured out,</v>

2005
01:34:27.821 --> 01:34:30.700
<v Speaker 2>bitch wide open on your own because few </v>
<v Speaker 2>people have got it.</v>

2006
01:34:30.701 --> 01:34:32.350
<v Speaker 2>You got to like find these masters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2007
01:34:32.351 --> 01:34:33.184
<v Speaker 2>So if you think about the 300 and </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever million people we have in this </v>

2008
01:34:36.791 --> 01:34:39.190
<v Speaker 2>country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many of those people could guide you</v>

2009
01:34:39.550 --> 01:34:40.383
<v Speaker 2>towards a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a proper integration of mind and body </v>

2010
01:34:43.750 --> 01:34:44.583
<v Speaker 2>and a positive way of interfacing with </v>
<v Speaker 2>reality that's beneficial to you </v>

2011
01:34:49.091 --> 01:34:50.860
<v Speaker 2>physically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mentally,</v>

2012
01:34:51.490 --> 01:34:53.510
<v Speaker 2>spiritually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not many.</v>

2013
01:34:53.620 --> 01:34:55.960
<v Speaker 2>Is there a dozen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not many.</v>

2014
01:34:57.170 --> 01:34:58.003
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it interesting with all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings and essentially most of </v>

2015
01:35:02.091 --> 01:35:06.110
<v Speaker 2>them trying to improve in some way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even people that fail on diets,</v>

2016
01:35:06.111 --> 01:35:09.350
<v Speaker 2>but they'd like to get skinny?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even people that fail at school,</v>

2017
01:35:09.351 --> 01:35:11.000
<v Speaker 2>while I wish I was smart enough to </v>
<v Speaker 2>graduate,</v>

2018
01:35:11.001 --> 01:35:14.300
<v Speaker 2>I wish I had enough discipline people </v>
<v Speaker 2>people want to do better,</v>

2019
01:35:14.660 --> 01:35:15.493
<v Speaker 2>so there's this vast need for coaching </v>
<v Speaker 2>that would lead to improvement yet </v>

2020
01:35:20.030 --> 01:35:25.030
<v Speaker 2>almost mean nothing to speak of and </v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly not nothing large scale in any</v>

2021
01:35:25.461 --> 01:35:28.760
<v Speaker 2>city that has this approach where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2022
01:35:28.770 --> 01:35:29.603
<v Speaker 2>we're going to teach you how to better </v>
<v Speaker 2>engage with the material world around </v>

2023
01:35:35.331 --> 01:35:38.510
<v Speaker 2>you and the better engage with reality </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>

2024
01:35:38.630 --> 01:35:41.060
<v Speaker 2>That's going to leave you a more </v>
<v Speaker 2>spiritually,</v>

2025
01:35:41.061 --> 01:35:43.490
<v Speaker 2>physically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>emotionally fulfilled like that.</v>

2026
01:35:43.500 --> 01:35:45.380
<v Speaker 2>It seems like that'll be a big business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would go.</v>

2027
01:35:45.410 --> 01:35:50.020
<v Speaker 2>One way to teach this stuff is by </v>
<v Speaker 2>example that if a person exemplifies,</v>

2028
01:35:50.590 --> 01:35:51.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good mind,</v>

2029
01:35:51.701 --> 01:35:54.320
<v Speaker 2>body functioning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can inspire that and another person</v>

2030
01:35:54.410 --> 01:35:57.890
<v Speaker 2>that seems like maybe the only way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one strategy that I.</v>

2031
01:35:57.890 --> 01:36:00.170
<v Speaker 2>If I can do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I have a patient,</v>

2032
01:36:00.500 --> 01:36:04.610
<v Speaker 2>if I can introduce that patient to </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who's had their condition is now</v>

2033
01:36:04.611 --> 01:36:05.444
<v Speaker 2>better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is a very powerful way to up their </v>

2034
01:36:08.871 --> 01:36:10.460
<v Speaker 2>belief in the possibility of getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>

2035
01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:11.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes sense.</v>

2036
01:36:11.781 --> 01:36:14.420
<v Speaker 2>Which is why people love user </v>
<v Speaker 2>testimonials.</v>

2037
01:36:14.450 --> 01:36:15.730
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2038
01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:19.640
<v Speaker 2>but better if you actually meet the </v>
<v Speaker 2>person and show see for yourself,</v>

2039
01:36:20.420 --> 01:36:22.340
<v Speaker 2>but use your testimonials are so huge </v>
<v Speaker 2>for that.</v>

2040
01:36:22.341 --> 01:36:23.001
<v Speaker 2>Raise your right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2041
01:36:23.001 --> 01:36:23.834
<v Speaker 2>I was skeptical at first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then I tried it and boy he was </v>

2042
01:36:26.991 --> 01:36:31.991
<v Speaker 2>skeptical just like me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It to me when I look at the giant number</v>

2043
01:36:34.641 --> 01:36:35.474
<v Speaker 2>of people that are unhappy and displaced</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just seem like they're left out of </v>

2044
01:36:39.651 --> 01:36:42.680
<v Speaker 2>society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was listening to.</v>

2045
01:36:42.770 --> 01:36:43.603
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was Johann Hari on Sam Harris' </v>

2046
01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:46.633
<v Speaker 2>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were talking about the number of </v>

2047
01:36:49.101 --> 01:36:53.840
<v Speaker 2>people that are happy with what they do </v>
<v Speaker 2>for a living.</v>

2048
01:36:54.350 --> 01:36:55.183
<v Speaker 2>Happy with what they do every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was somewhere around 13 percent </v>

2049
01:36:57.881 --> 01:36:59.450
<v Speaker 2>and long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2050
01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:02.480
<v Speaker 2>And then the number of people that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>

2051
01:37:02.481 --> 01:37:03.950
<v Speaker 2>it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just do it.</v>

2052
01:37:04.070 --> 01:37:05.180
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't hate it,</v>

2053
01:37:05.210 --> 01:37:08.510
<v Speaker 2>but I don't love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was like in the 60 percent and then</v>

2054
01:37:08.511 --> 01:37:11.450
<v Speaker 2>the rest of the people fucking hated </v>
<v Speaker 2>what they did.</v>

2055
01:37:11.810 --> 01:37:16.580
<v Speaker 2>So the vast majority,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some ungodly number,</v>

2056
01:37:16.610 --> 01:37:17.443
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 87 percent of people hate what </v>

2057
01:37:20.061 --> 01:37:20.870
<v Speaker 2>they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2058
01:37:20.870 --> 01:37:23.000
<v Speaker 2>how sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or if don't hate it,</v>

2059
01:37:23.120 --> 01:37:25.640
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to be doing it and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>do it all the time.</v>

2060
01:37:25.700 --> 01:37:27.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy that,</v>

2061
01:37:27.831 --> 01:37:32.540
<v Speaker 2>that has to have a profound effect on </v>
<v Speaker 2>all aspects of your life.</v>

2062
01:37:32.541 --> 01:37:33.374
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like what I do when you seem like you </v>

2063
01:37:35.420 --> 01:37:36.253
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a twinkle in your eye when you </v>

2064
01:37:37.461 --> 01:37:38.294
<v Speaker 2>talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean it's got to give you some </v>

2065
01:37:41.241 --> 01:37:42.380
<v Speaker 2>satisfaction for sure.</v>

2066
01:37:42.380 --> 01:37:43.100
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2067
01:37:43.100 --> 01:37:44.630
<v Speaker 2>Help all these people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

2068
01:37:44.631 --> 01:37:46.660
<v Speaker 2>And also to see a lot of the things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

2069
01:37:46.661 --> 01:37:47.494
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2070
01:37:47.800 --> 01:37:49.760
<v Speaker 2>believed for so long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>becoming more mainstream.</v>

2071
01:37:49.761 --> 01:37:50.720
<v Speaker 2>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2072
01:37:51.350 --> 01:37:54.710
<v Speaker 2>And much more so now than ever before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More so now than ever before.</v>

2073
01:37:54.740 --> 01:37:56.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you were doing those studies in the</v>

2074
01:37:56.161 --> 01:37:56.994
<v Speaker 2>19 sixties and you thought that </v>
<v Speaker 2>marijuana is going to be legal in five </v>

2075
01:37:59.071 --> 01:38:01.050
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how could you have ever.</v>

2076
01:38:01.110 --> 01:38:01.943
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how could you have ever thought of the </v>

2077
01:38:02.941 --> 01:38:03.751
<v Speaker 2>Internet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2078
01:38:03.751 --> 01:38:05.910
<v Speaker 2>That's the big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The distortion of information.</v>

2079
01:38:05.940 --> 01:38:07.200
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2080
01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:09.270
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really the big one.</v>

2081
01:38:09.271 --> 01:38:12.130
<v Speaker 2>The decentralized APP distribution of </v>
<v Speaker 2>information,</v>

2082
01:38:12.180 --> 01:38:14.490
<v Speaker 2>and that's by the way in medicine has </v>
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>

2083
01:38:14.491 --> 01:38:15.324
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the things that's most </v>
<v Speaker 2>leveled the playing field between </v>

2084
01:38:17.101 --> 01:38:20.790
<v Speaker 2>doctors and patients sort of ended the </v>
<v Speaker 2>authoritarian,</v>

2085
01:38:20.791 --> 01:38:24.450
<v Speaker 2>paternalistic kind of medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was when I grew up.</v>

2086
01:38:25.170 --> 01:38:25.880
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2087
01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:27.180
<v Speaker 2>it is a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2088
01:38:27.180 --> 01:38:29.730
<v Speaker 2>A patient comes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think they know everything.</v>

2089
01:38:29.731 --> 01:38:31.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I had seen,</v>

2090
01:38:31.231 --> 01:38:32.064
<v Speaker 2>I have seen many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many patients who have gotten exactly </v>

2091
01:38:34.471 --> 01:38:37.860
<v Speaker 2>the information they needed and were </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to take it to the doctor who didn't</v>

2092
01:38:37.861 --> 01:38:38.850
<v Speaker 2>know about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2093
01:38:38.851 --> 01:38:40.920
<v Speaker 2>I think on the whole it's a really good </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

2094
01:38:41.010 --> 01:38:41.930
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

2095
01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:42.451
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2096
01:38:42.451 --> 01:38:43.284
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying just like I get how doctors </v>

2097
01:38:44.821 --> 01:38:47.340
<v Speaker 2>would be worn out by it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No less than I'm a,</v>

2098
01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:49.200
<v Speaker 2>I went to school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what it is.</v>

2099
01:38:49.230 --> 01:38:50.063
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's good for them to have to let go of </v>

2100
01:38:50.941 --> 01:38:51.774
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2101
01:38:51.840 --> 01:38:52.673
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no way you could know </v>

2102
01:38:54.331 --> 01:38:55.260
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>True.</v>

2103
01:38:55.340 --> 01:38:56.173
<v Speaker 2>And especially doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they must know that they have a </v>

2104
01:38:57.841 --> 01:39:01.860
<v Speaker 2>specialty for a reason because the human</v>
<v Speaker 2>body is so insanely complicated.</v>

2105
01:39:02.130 --> 01:39:02.963
<v Speaker 2>There's no way anybody is a general </v>
<v Speaker 2>specialist of every single aspect of </v>

2106
01:39:05.551 --> 01:39:07.350
<v Speaker 2>medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we need more generalists.</v>

2107
01:39:07.350 --> 01:39:09.930
<v Speaker 2>One of the problems that we've got too </v>
<v Speaker 2>many specialists and there's.</v>

2108
01:39:09.990 --> 01:39:10.823
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so someone like would you think of a </v>

2109
01:39:12.061 --> 01:39:15.210
<v Speaker 2>generalist as someone who sort of guides</v>
<v Speaker 2>you towards various specialists?</v>

2110
01:39:15.330 --> 01:39:17.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm a general practitioner and I'm very </v>
<v Speaker 2>proud of it.</v>

2111
01:39:17.790 --> 01:39:21.660
<v Speaker 2>There's good data showing that states </v>
<v Speaker 2>that have a higher number of prime of,</v>

2112
01:39:21.661 --> 01:39:24.540
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a primary care physicians,</v>

2113
01:39:24.600 --> 01:39:25.433
<v Speaker 2>family doctors have better medical </v>
<v Speaker 2>outcomes than patients with a high </v>

2114
01:39:28.931 --> 01:39:30.740
<v Speaker 2>percentage of specialists that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem,</v>

2115
01:39:30.780 --> 01:39:34.290
<v Speaker 2>some specialties pay more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we should be changing that.</v>

2116
01:39:34.291 --> 01:39:37.590
<v Speaker 2>We should be providing financial </v>
<v Speaker 2>incentives for people to go into general</v>

2117
01:39:37.591 --> 01:39:38.580
<v Speaker 2>medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2118
01:39:38.590 --> 01:39:41.070
<v Speaker 2>Would also make sense to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the time you get to a specialist,</v>

2119
01:39:41.071 --> 01:39:43.110
<v Speaker 2>usually you're really messed up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2120
01:39:43.130 --> 01:39:45.210
<v Speaker 2>And if you're going to a back </v>
<v Speaker 2>specialist,</v>

2121
01:39:45.211 --> 01:39:48.150
<v Speaker 2>you might have like a real situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been bothering me for a long time.</v>

2122
01:39:48.570 --> 01:39:51.390
<v Speaker 2>Whereas you go into a general </v>
<v Speaker 2>practitioner for a checkup.</v>

2123
01:39:51.420 --> 01:39:56.090
<v Speaker 2>This is my biannual checkup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just kind of giving you the once over</v>

2124
01:39:56.110 --> 01:39:58.800
<v Speaker 2>making sure everything's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you sleep and high eating,</v>

2125
01:39:58.830 --> 01:40:00.210
<v Speaker 2>drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>smoking cigarettes,</v>

2126
01:40:00.211 --> 01:40:03.050
<v Speaker 2>what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just get a sense of you,</v>

2127
01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:05.520
<v Speaker 2>but they do they have enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Time is not a big issue.</v>

2128
01:40:05.630 --> 01:40:09.450
<v Speaker 2>Like what time do you spend when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're working with patients?</v>

2129
01:40:09.451 --> 01:40:14.451
<v Speaker 2>I take an hour and in our clinics we do </v>
<v Speaker 2>90 minutes on a first session.</v>

2130
01:40:14.670 --> 01:40:15.503
<v Speaker 2>That's gotta be nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ninety minutes you can get to know </v>

2131
01:40:16.951 --> 01:40:18.780
<v Speaker 2>somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you're getting in and out of that</v>

2132
01:40:18.781 --> 01:40:21.420
<v Speaker 2>office in 10 minutes he'd just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's a prescription.</v>

2133
01:40:21.690 --> 01:40:23.610
<v Speaker 2>Get out of here next.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know the,</v>

2134
01:40:24.270 --> 01:40:25.103
<v Speaker 2>the has been studies on the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>time in a medical encounter when a </v>

2135
01:40:29.611 --> 01:40:30.444
<v Speaker 2>patient starts to talk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how soon a doctor interrupts the </v>

2136
01:40:32.191 --> 01:40:35.130
<v Speaker 2>patient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have any guess what that is now?</v>

2137
01:40:35.190 --> 01:40:36.540
<v Speaker 2>Thirteen seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>

2138
01:40:36.750 --> 01:40:37.381
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2139
01:40:37.381 --> 01:40:38.214
<v Speaker 2>13 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used the same number of people that </v>

2140
01:40:40.921 --> 01:40:42.590
<v Speaker 2>are happy with what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ha,</v>

2141
01:40:42.870 --> 01:40:45.000
<v Speaker 2>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty good.</v>

2142
01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:47.220
<v Speaker 2>Thirteen seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Not just taste good,</v>

2169
01:41:47.681 --> 01:41:49.180
<v Speaker 2>but good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Primarily.</v>

2170
01:41:49.181 --> 01:41:50.014
<v Speaker 2>It's food that looks great and tastes </v>
<v Speaker 2>great and happens to conform to good </v>

2171
01:41:52.601 --> 01:41:53.690
<v Speaker 2>nutritional science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2172
01:41:53.710 --> 01:41:54.543
<v Speaker 2>That is possible and that's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people think you have to eat fried </v>

2173
01:41:56.561 --> 01:41:58.570
<v Speaker 2>chicken and we'll come in there and try </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2174
01:41:58.630 --> 01:42:00.220
<v Speaker 2>I would love to try it all right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>

2175
01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:02.193
<v Speaker 2>How do you eat for the most part?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You said you eat fish and you eat </v>

2176
01:42:04.151 --> 01:42:07.210
<v Speaker 2>through the full.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try to grow a lot of my own food.</v>

2177
01:42:07.211 --> 01:42:09.390
<v Speaker 2>I love food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fresh stuff out of the garden.</v>

2178
01:42:09.400 --> 01:42:12.340
<v Speaker 2>I like to cook and I invent recipes </v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

2179
01:42:12.341 --> 01:42:13.174
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the recipes and the restaurant </v>

2180
01:42:13.841 --> 01:42:16.730
<v Speaker 2>or mine a great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

2181
01:42:17.170 --> 01:42:19.510
<v Speaker 2>I like simple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>simple,</v>

2182
01:42:19.511 --> 01:42:23.110
<v Speaker 2>quick preparations that are really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you fast at all?</v>

2183
01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:24.513
<v Speaker 2>I have been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've experimented with intermittent </v>

2184
01:42:25.451 --> 01:42:29.950
<v Speaker 2>fasting and I haven't found a regimen </v>
<v Speaker 2>that works exactly right for me,</v>

2185
01:42:29.951 --> 01:42:33.880
<v Speaker 2>but I'm fascinated by it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do a 18 or 16 and eight.</v>

2186
01:42:34.210 --> 01:42:37.510
<v Speaker 2>And how often do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try to do it four days a week.</v>

2187
01:42:39.700 --> 01:42:41.860
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it's difficult when I travel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2188
01:42:41.950 --> 01:42:45.520
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even then I'm more accustomed to it than</v>

2189
01:42:45.521 --> 01:42:49.750
<v Speaker 2>ever before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if I eat dinner at 8:00</v>

2190
01:42:49.751 --> 01:42:50.341
<v Speaker 2>at night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2191
01:42:50.341 --> 01:42:52.970
<v Speaker 2>it's not hard to wait till she's back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2192
01:42:53.140 --> 01:42:54.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not hard.</v>

2193
01:42:54.410 --> 01:42:57.220
<v Speaker 2>My body's just really used to it now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How long have you been doing it?</v>

2194
01:42:57.490 --> 01:42:59.860
<v Speaker 2>About a year or so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe a little bit more than that.</v>

2195
01:42:59.940 --> 01:43:02.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that makes a lot of sense.</v>

2196
01:43:02.141 --> 01:43:02.974
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>continue to experiment with what I </v>

2197
01:43:05.591 --> 01:43:06.424
<v Speaker 2>haven't done that I really have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking a lot about doing is doing a </v>

2198
01:43:08.951 --> 01:43:11.530
<v Speaker 2>multiple day fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just a water fast.</v>

2199
01:43:11.531 --> 01:43:14.020
<v Speaker 2>I've done that for the longest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done it for three days.</v>

2200
01:43:14.250 --> 01:43:16.420
<v Speaker 2>How was that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first day was difficult.</v>

2201
01:43:16.870 --> 01:43:19.150
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or actually the second day was difficult</v>

2202
01:43:19.151 --> 01:43:20.500
<v Speaker 2>the third day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fabulous.</v>

2203
01:43:20.501 --> 01:43:21.940
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt energized.</v>

2204
01:43:21.941 --> 01:43:23.800
<v Speaker 2>Hi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My mind working very clear.</v>

2205
01:43:23.801 --> 01:43:24.634
<v Speaker 2>The problem that I have is how do you </v>
<v Speaker 2>come off it because it's very easy to </v>

2206
01:43:29.021 --> 01:43:32.790
<v Speaker 2>slide into eating pizza krispy Kreme to.</v>

2207
01:43:32.790 --> 01:43:34.070
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2208
01:43:34.560 --> 01:43:38.470
<v Speaker 2>I think there's protocols in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like small amounts of fruit,</v>

2209
01:43:38.471 --> 01:43:39.304
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like right when you're coming out of </v>

2210
01:43:40.210 --> 01:43:41.980
<v Speaker 2>blueberries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which to me was.</v>

2211
01:43:41.981 --> 01:43:46.981
<v Speaker 2>The tricky part was transitioning off it</v>
<v Speaker 2>go too fast with the buzzer.</v>

2212
01:43:47.171 --> 01:43:50.170
<v Speaker 2>Rang schools out for summer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2213
01:43:50.260 --> 01:43:51.093
<v Speaker 2>I get it man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean especially if you feel like you </v>

2214
01:43:52.971 --> 01:43:54.740
<v Speaker 2>earned it right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't eat for three days.</v>

2215
01:43:54.741 --> 01:43:55.720
<v Speaker 2>You want that pizza.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2216
01:43:56.300 --> 01:43:57.770
<v Speaker 2>One of the things I found when I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it,</v>

2217
01:43:57.771 --> 01:43:59.880
<v Speaker 2>having a bowl of March,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2218
01:43:59.881 --> 01:44:00.714
<v Speaker 2>I normally my my pattern is I want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>eat as soon as I get up so that those </v>

2219
01:44:05.090 --> 01:44:06.610
<v Speaker 2>morning hours are hard for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if I have a,</v>

2220
01:44:06.850 --> 01:44:10.010
<v Speaker 2>have my macho that helps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you exercise?</v>

2221
01:44:10.220 --> 01:44:13.720
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I swim mostly walk everyday.</v>

2222
01:44:14.030 --> 01:44:17.780
<v Speaker 2>I find that once my body got used to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fast to exercise,</v>

2223
01:44:18.150 --> 01:44:18.983
<v Speaker 2>it became much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much easier and it just became like </v>

2224
01:44:23.150 --> 01:44:25.550
<v Speaker 2>before I would almost have anxiety </v>
<v Speaker 2>attached to it.</v>

2225
01:44:25.550 --> 01:44:27.500
<v Speaker 2>Like God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't work out without food.</v>

2226
01:44:27.840 --> 01:44:28.673
<v Speaker 2>I have to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when I started doing the </v>

2227
01:44:30.381 --> 01:44:33.500
<v Speaker 2>intermittent fast and then I started </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing fasted exercise,</v>

2228
01:44:34.640 --> 01:44:35.473
<v Speaker 2>I think it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure I pr if you probably measured </v>

2229
01:44:39.411 --> 01:44:40.244
<v Speaker 2>me in terms of like a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did a bunch of like weight lifting </v>

2230
01:44:43.341 --> 01:44:44.174
<v Speaker 2>exercises and measured my output.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably would be able to lift more </v>

2231
01:44:47.061 --> 01:44:47.894
<v Speaker 2>weights if I had some fruit first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure I'd have a little bit </v>

2232
01:44:50.541 --> 01:44:52.280
<v Speaker 2>more energy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably measurable,</v>

2233
01:44:52.460 --> 01:44:53.293
<v Speaker 2>but it's not difficult to have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>vigorous workout in the morning when </v>

2234
01:44:56.841 --> 01:44:58.730
<v Speaker 2>you're fasting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just kinda get used to it.</v>

2235
01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:03.830
<v Speaker 2>And I often do either hot yoga or run </v>
<v Speaker 2>first thing in the morning.</v>

2236
01:45:04.050 --> 01:45:06.980
<v Speaker 2>Weight lifting seems to be a bit of an </v>
<v Speaker 2>issue with weight lifting.</v>

2237
01:45:06.981 --> 01:45:07.814
<v Speaker 2>I don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to eat something before I lift </v>

2238
01:45:09.081 --> 01:45:09.914
<v Speaker 2>weights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

2239
01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:11.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But swimming.</v>

2240
01:45:12.230 --> 01:45:15.320
<v Speaker 2>But you ever fasted swim?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fine.</v>

2241
01:45:15.580 --> 01:45:19.010
<v Speaker 2>No problem with it now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you get off the pot?</v>

2242
01:45:20.090 --> 01:45:21.710
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it changed for me in,</v>

2243
01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:22.673
<v Speaker 2>in I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really used it regularly in my </v>

2244
01:45:26.120 --> 01:45:29.900
<v Speaker 2>twenties and thirties and when I first </v>
<v Speaker 2>started using it,</v>

2245
01:45:30.200 --> 01:45:31.490
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was great.</v>

2246
01:45:31.491 --> 01:45:35.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was like hilarious highs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>laughing a lot of them.</v>

2247
01:45:35.810 --> 01:45:40.080
<v Speaker 2>Then it turned after several years more </v>
<v Speaker 2>introspective and,</v>

2248
01:45:40.250 --> 01:45:44.000
<v Speaker 2>and interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like creative writing for helping,</v>

2249
01:45:44.001 --> 01:45:44.834
<v Speaker 2>writing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that and then gradually </v>

2250
01:45:46.491 --> 01:45:50.900
<v Speaker 2>transitioned into making me groggy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>not doing much for me.</v>

2251
01:45:50.901 --> 01:45:52.300
<v Speaker 2>And for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2252
01:45:52.400 --> 01:45:54.230
<v Speaker 2>it took me a while to separate myself </v>
<v Speaker 2>from it,</v>

2253
01:45:54.231 --> 01:45:55.064
<v Speaker 2>but in the last years of it it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>groggy and sedated that I think I </v>

2254
01:45:57.831 --> 01:46:00.860
<v Speaker 2>changed my body changed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>

2255
01:46:01.460 --> 01:46:04.670
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever tried different strains?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have.</v>

2256
01:46:04.671 --> 01:46:07.010
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like to smoke because I'm really</v>

2257
01:46:07.011 --> 01:46:09.520
<v Speaker 2>into breathing and I just kept put smoke</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the oil.</v>

2258
01:46:09.580 --> 01:46:11.450
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've tried a vaping.</v>

2259
01:46:11.451 --> 01:46:13.700
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't like the effect of it these</v>

2260
01:46:13.700 --> 01:46:14.533
<v Speaker 2>days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Aping,</v>

2261
01:46:14.860 --> 01:46:16.240
<v Speaker 2>I just don't like the effect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2262
01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:18.800
<v Speaker 2>I don't like oral feels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2263
01:46:18.801 --> 01:46:20.780
<v Speaker 2>it's too strong for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2264
01:46:21.080 --> 01:46:25.370
<v Speaker 2>Well when you're talking about that half</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a half a grain of sand putting you on</v>

2265
01:46:25.371 --> 01:46:30.371
<v Speaker 2>Pluto for agreement sand that funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine that at that would be like acid.</v>

2266
01:46:31.490 --> 01:46:32.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>

2267
01:46:32.240 --> 01:46:33.410
<v Speaker 2>Felt like acid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2268
01:46:33.411 --> 01:46:35.450
<v Speaker 2>Well boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you,</v>

2269
01:46:35.451 --> 01:46:37.220
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>

2270
01:46:37.310 --> 01:46:38.143
<v Speaker 2>the most profound and intense experience</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ever have in the sensory deprivation </v>

2271
01:46:41.631 --> 01:46:45.650
<v Speaker 2>tank or edible marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Edible marijuana in that tank.</v>

2272
01:46:45.680 --> 01:46:47.570
<v Speaker 2>That combination is just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

2273
01:46:47.990 --> 01:46:51.440
<v Speaker 2>Huh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A real strong dose because you.</v>

2274
01:46:51.510 --> 01:46:53.130
<v Speaker 2>Have you done the tank at all?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2275
01:46:53.131 --> 01:46:55.080
<v Speaker 2>But not with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not with pot.</v>

2276
01:46:55.081 --> 01:46:57.150
<v Speaker 2>And psychedelics long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2277
01:46:57.270 --> 01:46:58.103
<v Speaker 2>Well even sober you have some pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>trippy experiences while you're in </v>

2278
01:47:00.661 --> 01:47:01.200
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

2279
01:47:01.200 --> 01:47:06.200
<v Speaker 2>But there's something about the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I experienced with edible marijuana</v>

2280
01:47:07.350 --> 01:47:08.210
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2281
01:47:08.400 --> 01:47:11.220
<v Speaker 2>when you close your eyes you get a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of really cool visuals.</v>

2282
01:47:11.240 --> 01:47:14.790
<v Speaker 2>Like I've had it before when I take pot </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then get on a plane,</v>

2283
01:47:15.120 --> 01:47:16.650
<v Speaker 2>like I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll eat right.</v>

2284
01:47:16.651 --> 01:47:19.350
<v Speaker 2>Right when I parked my car at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>airport or when I'm leaving the house.</v>

2285
01:47:19.351 --> 01:47:20.880
<v Speaker 2>Then it kicks in when you're on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>plane.</v>

2286
01:47:20.940 --> 01:47:23.970
<v Speaker 2>Like closing your eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

2287
01:47:24.180 --> 01:47:25.013
<v Speaker 2>Something about closing your eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The you have like really brightly </v>

2288
01:47:27.571 --> 01:47:28.404
<v Speaker 2>colored colored visuals oftentimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I get that a lot inside the tank </v>

2289
01:47:33.570 --> 01:47:35.290
<v Speaker 2>with marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

2290
01:47:36.560 --> 01:47:40.080
<v Speaker 2>I had that with that real strong stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely had a lot of visual stuff.</v>

2291
01:47:40.081 --> 01:47:41.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what's weird about it.</v>

2292
01:47:41.251 --> 01:47:43.680
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it does become a psychedelic.</v>

2293
01:47:43.720 --> 01:47:45.470
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially at high dose.</v>

2294
01:47:46.590 --> 01:47:50.790
<v Speaker 2>Why are they making that stuff so </v>
<v Speaker 2>strongly unnecessary when,</v>

2295
01:47:50.970 --> 01:47:52.800
<v Speaker 2>how many milligrams did they say it was?</v>

2296
01:47:53.050 --> 01:47:57.450
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't much because they've got these </v>
<v Speaker 2>damn Chiba Chews.</v>

2297
01:47:57.451 --> 01:48:01.110
<v Speaker 2>They're like 500 milligrams for one </v>
<v Speaker 2>little cake.</v>

2298
01:48:01.350 --> 01:48:03.880
<v Speaker 2>One little thing like that bank,</v>
<v Speaker 2>500 milligrams,</v>

2299
01:48:03.881 --> 01:48:08.380
<v Speaker 2>like why do you need that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you started out with 10 and then</v>

2300
01:48:08.390 --> 01:48:10.430
<v Speaker 2>you worked your way up to $500.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2301
01:48:10.830 --> 01:48:13.110
<v Speaker 2>I guess there's a tolerance issue which </v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of folks,</v>

2302
01:48:13.111 --> 01:48:13.944
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2303
01:48:14.420 --> 01:48:17.040
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you,</v>

2304
01:48:17.041 --> 01:48:22.041
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you regularly meditate or to do every</v>

2305
01:48:23.191 --> 01:48:25.290
<v Speaker 2>morning when I get up what kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>meditation?</v>

2306
01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:29.550
<v Speaker 2>I first uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>practices in and then I took some of the</v>

2307
01:48:29.551 --> 01:48:33.060
<v Speaker 2>positive training and now I get up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sit down,</v>

2308
01:48:33.061 --> 01:48:38.061
<v Speaker 2>I do my breathing routine and then I </v>
<v Speaker 2>just try to focus on body sensations and</v>

2309
01:48:40.291 --> 01:48:45.291
<v Speaker 2>the sounds in the room and when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>caught up in my thoughts I just bring my</v>

2310
01:48:45.751 --> 01:48:48.900
<v Speaker 2>attention back to my breathing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2311
01:48:48.901 --> 01:48:49.561
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>

2312
01:48:49.561 --> 01:48:52.350
<v Speaker 2>I think that the sitting sitting in </v>
<v Speaker 2>meditation,</v>

2313
01:48:52.680 --> 01:48:53.340
<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>

2314
01:48:53.340 --> 01:48:54.173
<v Speaker 2>But I think the goal is to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>carry that state and all of your </v>

2315
01:48:56.671 --> 01:48:58.780
<v Speaker 2>activities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2316
01:48:58.920 --> 01:49:02.850
<v Speaker 2>so for me cooking is meditative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chopping vegetables,</v>

2317
01:49:02.851 --> 01:49:06.900
<v Speaker 2>working with knives and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's very meditative for me.</v>

2318
01:49:07.470 --> 01:49:12.060
<v Speaker 2>So when do you think that when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>having this meditation,</v>

2319
01:49:12.061 --> 01:49:14.250
<v Speaker 2>whether it's Zen or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that your,</v>

2320
01:49:14.460 --> 01:49:19.290
<v Speaker 2>you're resetting the way you're gonna go</v>
<v Speaker 2>through life for the rest of the day.</v>

2321
01:49:19.530 --> 01:49:20.363
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully that's the goal is to carry </v>
<v Speaker 2>that state throughout the day where you </v>

2322
01:49:25.771 --> 01:49:28.710
<v Speaker 2>kind of have a responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't you agree?</v>

2323
01:49:28.740 --> 01:49:32.850
<v Speaker 2>Like your guy who's teaching people how </v>
<v Speaker 2>to live a more productive,</v>

2324
01:49:32.851 --> 01:49:33.421
<v Speaker 2>healthier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>live.</v>

2325
01:49:33.421 --> 01:49:35.430
<v Speaker 2>You kind of have a responsibility to </v>
<v Speaker 2>live your own productive,</v>

2326
01:49:35.431 --> 01:49:36.360
<v Speaker 2>healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>live better.</v>

2327
01:49:36.361 --> 01:49:37.194
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't feel right doing that if I </v>

2328
01:49:38.431 --> 01:49:40.260
<v Speaker 2>didn't practice it more slippery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2329
01:49:40.530 --> 01:49:42.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I don't tell people to do things.</v>

2330
01:49:42.940 --> 01:49:47.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't do it myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you have some thoughts about things</v>

2331
01:49:47.110 --> 01:49:47.943
<v Speaker 2>like something like a Boga,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you be interested in trying it </v>

2332
01:49:49.601 --> 01:49:50.070
<v Speaker 2>yourself?</v>

2333
01:49:50.070 --> 01:49:50.903
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2334
01:49:51.180 --> 01:49:53.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't had the opportunity to do it.</v>

2335
01:49:53.080 --> 01:49:55.580
<v Speaker 2>It's supposed to be ruthlessly </v>
<v Speaker 2>interspective [inaudible].</v>

2336
01:49:55.720 --> 01:49:57.790
<v Speaker 2>I've never done it either,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've had,</v>

2337
01:49:57.820 --> 01:50:00.340
<v Speaker 2>I've had friends who had a pill problems</v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

2338
01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:01.473
<v Speaker 2>who did it and cured them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they said the ride is just 24 hours </v>

2339
01:50:04.991 --> 01:50:07.030
<v Speaker 2>of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what in the fuck am I doing?</v>

2340
01:50:07.450 --> 01:50:08.283
<v Speaker 2>And then once it's over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have zero desire the way that it's </v>

2341
01:50:10.481 --> 01:50:11.770
<v Speaker 2>used.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Traditionally in Africa,</v>

2342
01:50:11.771 --> 01:50:12.604
<v Speaker 2>the root,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's these tribes that user that's </v>

2343
01:50:15.930 --> 01:50:20.930
<v Speaker 2>hunters take it and they remained </v>
<v Speaker 2>motionless for many hours on it.</v>

2344
01:50:22.330 --> 01:50:24.090
<v Speaker 2>The animals come close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2345
01:50:24.091 --> 01:50:29.050
<v Speaker 2>that always fascinated me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is fascinating.</v>

2346
01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:31.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if,</v>

2347
01:50:31.021 --> 01:50:32.470
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking it from the root.</v>

2348
01:50:32.471 --> 01:50:34.130
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if they have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's,</v>

2349
01:50:34.840 --> 01:50:35.673
<v Speaker 2>they're getting the exact same </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences they're getting in these </v>

2350
01:50:37.061 --> 01:50:38.200
<v Speaker 2>clinics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2351
01:50:39.310 --> 01:50:40.143
<v Speaker 2>It just to me in terms of efficacy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the recidivism rates of </v>

2352
01:50:45.400 --> 01:50:48.580
<v Speaker 2>relapse rather,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're mean they're sir rubbery high.</v>

2353
01:50:48.700 --> 01:50:49.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy,</v>

2354
01:50:49.661 --> 01:50:50.290
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2355
01:50:50.290 --> 01:50:55.290
<v Speaker 2>How successful that stuff yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yet nobody wants to talk about that.</v>

2356
01:50:56.321 --> 01:50:57.154
<v Speaker 2>These are all these clinics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's crazy how many rehab clinics </v>

2357
01:50:59.311 --> 01:51:00.910

<v Speaker 2>We need you for six months.</v>

2358

2359
01:51:03.611 --> 01:51:04.444
<v Speaker 2>days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd go down there and get into an in a </v>
