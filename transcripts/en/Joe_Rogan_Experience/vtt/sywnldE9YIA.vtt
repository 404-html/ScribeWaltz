13
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.210
<v Speaker 1>talked to a bunch of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we said,</v>

14
00:00:48.211 --> 00:00:49.950
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should go do a fucking podcast.</v>

15
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.800
<v Speaker 1>So here we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we're silent.</v>

16
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.150
<v Speaker 1>It's all happened until we talked</v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves out.</v>

17
00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.390
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about this woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

18
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.100
<v Speaker 1>we didn't talk about too much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we should.</v>

19
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.780
<v Speaker 1>This woman who was the woman that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hillary Clinton brought up,</v>

20
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during the trump debate because she was</v>

21
00:01:10.051 --> 00:01:15.000
<v Speaker 1>saying that Donald Trump humiliated this</v>
<v Speaker 1>woman because he shamed her and</v>

22
00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:17.670
<v Speaker 1>humiliated her because she gained weight</v>
<v Speaker 1>while she was a missile.</v>

23
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.040
<v Speaker 1>Olympia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I missed this.</v>

24
00:01:20.041 --> 00:01:22.010
<v Speaker 1>I was in the bathroom and you guys had</v>
<v Speaker 1>this time.</v>

25
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.460
<v Speaker 1>She got up to 170 pounds according to</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump,</v>

26
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.390
<v Speaker 1>she went up from like one 20 to one 70.</v>
<v Speaker 1>According to him,</v>

27
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.940
<v Speaker 1>probably not right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably gained like 30 pounds.</v>

28
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.640
<v Speaker 1>But apparently she really did gain a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck load of weight.</v>

29
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.680
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Hillary Clinton made this big deal</v>

30
00:01:40.681 --> 00:01:43.980
<v Speaker 1>about like how awful it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did that to her and then they had</v>

31
00:01:43.981 --> 00:01:47.640
<v Speaker 1>these commercials already planned for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next day.</v>

32
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.040
<v Speaker 1>So they launched these commercials the</v>
<v Speaker 1>next day.</v>

33
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.080
<v Speaker 1>And the commercials they show this</v>
<v Speaker 1>woman,</v>

34
00:01:52.081 --> 00:01:55.680
<v Speaker 1>she's speaking any Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It talking about Donald Trump is</v>

35
00:01:55.681 --> 00:01:59.100
<v Speaker 1>terrible what he did to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He made me feel bad.</v>

36
00:01:59.101 --> 00:02:00.660
<v Speaker 1>He made me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was scared.</v>

37
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.840
<v Speaker 1>So then after that comes out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people start researching her.</v>

38
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.300
<v Speaker 1>They find out that she drove a getaway</v>
<v Speaker 1>car in a murder.</v>

39
00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:14.040
<v Speaker 1>That she threatened a drudge cause the</v>
<v Speaker 1>judge who is going after her boyfriend</v>

40
00:02:14.041 --> 00:02:16.980
<v Speaker 1>at the time that she drove away in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>getaway car that she threatened,</v>

41
00:02:16.981 --> 00:02:18.960
<v Speaker 1>the judge said that she was going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>kill the judge.</v>

42
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.000
<v Speaker 1>She had an elite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>All of the Mexican drug cartel kingpins</v>
<v Speaker 1>came to the baby's Christening.</v>

45
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.550

56
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.380

<v Speaker 2>I met a bad person,</v>

57
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.320
<v Speaker 2>but they had tried to take away from</v>
<v Speaker 2>what he did.</v>

58
00:03:11.321 --> 00:03:13.330
<v Speaker 2>What he did was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

59
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.660
<v Speaker 2>What I did was 20 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what he did was 20 years ago to heal.</v>

60
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:19.780
<v Speaker 2>All we did was calling fat.</v>

61
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.700

64
00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.540

<v Speaker 1>ordinarily that's a very rude thing to</v>

<v Speaker 1>attractive woman.</v>

79
00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.480

82
00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.370
<v Speaker 3>then that means he already paid her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

83
00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.020
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>might not be money.</v>

84
00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:25.100
<v Speaker 1>It might just be attention because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>gave her the opportunity to get back in</v>

85
00:04:25.101 --> 00:04:27.410
<v Speaker 1>the limelight.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Hillary Clinton commercial where it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the compiler nation of all the worst</v>

96
00:04:53.611 --> 00:04:58.170
<v Speaker 3>things that trump said over the past</v>
<v Speaker 3>year or whatever and um,</v>

97
00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.710
<v Speaker 3>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it literally his voice and the clip</v>

98
00:05:01.711 --> 00:05:03.540
<v Speaker 3>of him doing all these things and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

99
00:05:03.541 --> 00:05:07.350
<v Speaker 3>Mexicans are rapists and murderers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the little soundbites and the</v>

100
00:05:07.351 --> 00:05:08.770
<v Speaker 3>commercial goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

101
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.070
<v Speaker 3>and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it goes back to little kids back and</v>

104
00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.090
<v Speaker 3>And I was watching this commercial and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like the middle of the day and</v>

105
00:05:21.091 --> 00:05:24.000
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking of myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you paid to put,</v>

106
00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:28.020
<v Speaker 3>you're putting that stuff out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's your commercial.</v>

107
00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That all played once you just put that</v>

108
00:05:30.631 --> 00:05:33.210
<v Speaker 3>out there for the kids to see and over</v>
<v Speaker 3>and over again.</v>

109
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.440
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then the whole commercial,</v>

110
00:05:34.441 --> 00:05:37.020
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this what you want your kids to see?</v>

111
00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:39.930
<v Speaker 3>And it's like you just spend 30 million</v>
<v Speaker 3>bucks on that commercial.</v>

112
00:05:39.931 --> 00:05:40.730
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

113
00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:41.870
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in her defense,</v>

114
00:05:41.871 --> 00:05:43.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what you kids just wanted to see</v>

115
00:05:43.791 --> 00:05:46.980
<v Speaker 1>as the leader as like their role model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hang on.</v>

116
00:05:46.981 --> 00:05:48.470

117
00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.370
<v Speaker 3>comp is biting his tongue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we all know it.</v>

118
00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:56.140
<v Speaker 3>Once he drops that blow job card,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole world explodes.</v>

119
00:05:56.141 --> 00:05:58.110
<v Speaker 3>He's sitting on like a clothes or</v>

120
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.440
<v Speaker 1>liking comedian Lewinsky cards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

121
00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.540
<v Speaker 1>you'll be instantly they're telling him</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to do it.</v>

122
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.750
<v Speaker 1>Apparently they're trying to talk to him</v>
<v Speaker 1>to say,</v>

123
00:06:05.751 --> 00:06:07.670
<v Speaker 1>do not bring up the Monica Lewinsky</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

124
00:06:07.671 --> 00:06:10.820
<v Speaker 1>Cause he in the post press conference</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

125
00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:12.710
<v Speaker 1>he was saying how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

126
00:06:12.711 --> 00:06:13.341
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

127
00:06:13.341 --> 00:06:17.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm very proud of myself that I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't bring up Bill Clinton and his,</v>

128
00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:18.260
<v Speaker 1>his dalliances.</v>

129
00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:22.210
<v Speaker 3>I don't even think he has to mention</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bill Clinton.</v>

130
00:06:22.211 --> 00:06:23.980
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know if he had even said</v>

131
00:06:23.981 --> 00:06:25.810
<v Speaker 3>those exact words like I think he's just</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

132
00:06:25.811 --> 00:06:30.070
<v Speaker 3>let's just say there's a lot of things</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I'm not talking about that I could</v>

133
00:06:30.071 --> 00:06:33.130
<v Speaker 3>maybe bringing up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could bring up that wouldn't be good</v>

134
00:06:33.131 --> 00:06:35.020
<v Speaker 3>for her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't need to say what they are.</v>

135
00:06:35.021 --> 00:06:35.890
<v Speaker 3>You know what they are.</v>

136
00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:39.660
<v Speaker 1>I have a winning temperament.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One thing about me,</v>

137
00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.470
<v Speaker 1>I have a winning temperament.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone knows this,</v>

138
00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:46.110
<v Speaker 1>these debates that are whole areas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what's really funny is they both</v>

139
00:06:46.111 --> 00:06:49.740
<v Speaker 1>sucks so hard that all this dirt that</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes out about them,</v>

140
00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.920
<v Speaker 1>it's like no big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can we do a fight companion for the</v>

141
00:06:52.921 --> 00:06:54.990
<v Speaker 1>next,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we're talking about doing that?</v>

142
00:06:54.991 --> 00:06:57.120
<v Speaker 1>We were talking about that if I'm in</v>
<v Speaker 1>town,</v>

143
00:06:57.121 --> 00:06:59.310
<v Speaker 1>if I'm not working during the next one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to,</v>

144
00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:01.080
<v Speaker 1>we're going to hook something up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's two more,</v>

145
00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:02.210
<v Speaker 1>so two more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

146
00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:05.820
<v Speaker 1>There's one we're going to need to bring</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone legitimate end to like andy</v>

147
00:07:05.821 --> 00:07:07.110
<v Speaker 1>stump wants come in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>

148
00:07:07.111 --> 00:07:09.260
<v Speaker 1>in my friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>former navy seal and Andy,</v>

149
00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.400
<v Speaker 1>he'll be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll probably come into and maybe we</v>

150
00:07:11.401 --> 00:07:14.550
<v Speaker 1>bring in someone else that like knows</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paula.</v>

151
00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:16.940
<v Speaker 1>I'll drop some hot puns on that one too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

152
00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:20.400
<v Speaker 1>you're good for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But who knows politics like really well</v>

153
00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:23.640
<v Speaker 1>at Fitzsimons does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd probably be good at that,</v>

154
00:07:23.641 --> 00:07:24.090
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

155
00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:25.100
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

156
00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.190
<v Speaker 4>Who else did you see some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a conspiracy talked.</v>

157
00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.930
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this was going on during the debate</v>

158
00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:31.130
<v Speaker 4>first was like she was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>has,</v>

159
00:07:31.131 --> 00:07:35.170
<v Speaker 4>she had an earpiece fed stuff when I saw</v>
<v Speaker 4>last night was that uh,</v>

160
00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:39.770
<v Speaker 4>she got caught scratching my face like</v>
<v Speaker 4>this six times and they were signals to</v>

161
00:07:39.771 --> 00:07:42.440
<v Speaker 4>Lester Holt to like hit me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hit it with a Zinger now,</v>

162
00:07:42.441 --> 00:07:44.330
<v Speaker 4>like you're saying something and she,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

163
00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:49.490
<v Speaker 4>and then next would be like something</v>
<v Speaker 4>for like a pre predisposed talking point</v>

164
00:07:49.491 --> 00:07:50.570
<v Speaker 4>for it to get out.</v>

165
00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:55.050
<v Speaker 1>Well trump was saying that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Lester Holt Guy,</v>

166
00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:56.340
<v Speaker 1>the narrator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was he,</v>

167
00:07:56.350 --> 00:08:00.420
<v Speaker 1>the announcer which call a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the moderator was against him and</v>

168
00:08:00.421 --> 00:08:01.510
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a bad deal,</v>

169
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.940
<v Speaker 1>was a bad deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

170
00:08:02.941 --> 00:08:05.640
<v Speaker 1>it was a rig d microphone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says Mike was fucked up.</v>

171
00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:08.040
<v Speaker 1>That's where digital is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard them loud and clear at home,</v>

172
00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:11.460
<v Speaker 1>but he caught it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>caught him on some real shit,</v>

173
00:08:11.461 --> 00:08:13.560
<v Speaker 1>like the fact that trump supported the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iraq war,</v>

174
00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:16.900
<v Speaker 1>and even if you only said it on Howard</v>
<v Speaker 1>stern it,</v>

175
00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:19.500
<v Speaker 1>which is apparently where he said it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he only said,</v>

176
00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:20.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

177
00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:22.860
<v Speaker 4>break that down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess what he said it in passing the</v>

178
00:08:22.861 --> 00:08:24.980
<v Speaker 4>kind of statement like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

179
00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:25.913
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

180
00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:26.761
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we're,</v>

181
00:08:26.761 --> 00:08:27.151
<v Speaker 4>we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

182
00:08:27.151 --> 00:08:28.320
<v Speaker 4>I was heard someone said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't hear.</v>

183
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:31.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta be careful about things like</v>

184
00:08:31.041 --> 00:08:34.730
<v Speaker 1>that because if you do one day plan on</v>
<v Speaker 1>running for president,</v>

185
00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:36.380
<v Speaker 1>you can't just say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

186
00:08:36.381 --> 00:08:38.930
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I support your back war and say,</v>

187
00:08:38.931 --> 00:08:40.300
<v Speaker 1>I never supported that war.</v>

188
00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:47.080
<v Speaker 3>It's an interesting thing where it</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost seems it's everything backwards</v>

189
00:08:47.081 --> 00:08:49.120
<v Speaker 3>helps him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every time he messes up,</v>

190
00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:50.380
<v Speaker 3>it sort of helps him.</v>

191
00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:52.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't think this time it dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he looked bad.</v>

192
00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:55.133
<v Speaker 1>I thought he,</v>

193
00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:59.730
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not picking sides here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just totally judging the debate.</v>

194
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:04.940
<v Speaker 3>I think that the fact that people are</v>
<v Speaker 3>even wondering who won or who did good</v>

195
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.750
<v Speaker 3>means,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a huge victory for</v>

196
00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.780
<v Speaker 1>trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think people are wondering.</v>

197
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.900
<v Speaker 1>I think the polls really pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>overwhelmingly on her side.</v>

198
00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:18.210
<v Speaker 1>I think it was like 70% of the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>pull or 68% of the people polled thought</v>

199
00:09:18.211 --> 00:09:19.960
<v Speaker 1>she won.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought she won,</v>

200
00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:23.310
<v Speaker 1>but in his defense I didn't see the</v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning.</v>

201
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:26.520
<v Speaker 1>Apparently he did really well in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning and she did really well.</v>

202
00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.500
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that she said that I</v>

203
00:09:28.501 --> 00:09:30.960
<v Speaker 1>thought was really crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like she was going on about this thing</v>

204
00:09:30.961 --> 00:09:35.310
<v Speaker 1>about him calling women pigs and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>these different things and that he said,</v>

205
00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:38.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something about women being pregnant and</v>

206
00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:39.150
<v Speaker 1>working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget,</v>

207
00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:42.810
<v Speaker 1>I forget what that quote was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the weird one was he said</v>

208
00:09:42.811 --> 00:09:47.580
<v Speaker 1>that women should only get paid as much</v>
<v Speaker 1>as men if they earn it,</v>

209
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:50.183
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

210
00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:51.001
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

211
00:09:51.001 --> 00:09:52.050
<v Speaker 3>that's what I said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

212
00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:56.220
<v Speaker 3>I had it playing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were getting ready to do kill Tony</v>

213
00:09:56.221 --> 00:09:57.950
<v Speaker 3>and the belly room and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we,</v>

214
00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:01.620
<v Speaker 3>Josh Martin had his phone plugged in to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the overall speakers in the room.</v>

215
00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:04.020
<v Speaker 3>So like the whole room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's empty.</v>

216
00:10:04.021 --> 00:10:07.500
<v Speaker 3>It's just me and Josh just setting up</v>
<v Speaker 3>and stuff and you're playing at night,</v>

217
00:10:07.501 --> 00:10:10.020
<v Speaker 3>literally set out loud,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're damn right.</v>

218
00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:11.640
<v Speaker 3>Or whatever it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember that part.</v>

219
00:10:11.641 --> 00:10:12.380
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

220
00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:16.340
<v Speaker 5>Well imagine you just said the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The men should only get paid as much as</v>

221
00:10:16.341 --> 00:10:18.500
<v Speaker 5>women if they earn it and everybody</v>
<v Speaker 5>would go,</v>

222
00:10:18.501 --> 00:10:19.580
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well that makes sense.</v>

223
00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:24.440
<v Speaker 5>But the idea that women should somehow</v>
<v Speaker 5>know they get paid as much as men if</v>

224
00:10:24.441 --> 00:10:26.250
<v Speaker 5>they don't earn it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

225
00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:29.570
<v Speaker 5>I mean maybe we should like find the</v>
<v Speaker 5>exact quote here.</v>

226
00:10:29.571 --> 00:10:33.030
<v Speaker 5>Let me find the exact quote.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think he gets taken out of context,</v>

227
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:37.190
<v Speaker 5>not a good speaker.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even though he speaks a lot in public.</v>

228
00:10:37.191 --> 00:10:40.340
<v Speaker 5>I just think he's not good at</v>
<v Speaker 5>articulating the things he actually</v>

229
00:10:40.341 --> 00:10:41.500
<v Speaker 5>means or wants to say.</v>

230
00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:44.620
<v Speaker 3>And I think when the media does take him</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of context,</v>

231
00:10:44.621 --> 00:10:48.430
<v Speaker 3>and Ben's what he says a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but people notice that.</v>

232
00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:51.160
<v Speaker 3>And then when he does say some crazy</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>

233
00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:56.650
<v Speaker 3>I think that that only helps him when</v>
<v Speaker 3>that happens because it's like,</v>

234
00:10:56.651 --> 00:10:57.760
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here they go again.</v>

235
00:10:57.761 --> 00:10:58.560
<v Speaker 3>Ben Didn't trump,</v>

236
00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.240
<v Speaker 5>I'm stuck here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think he likes her.</v>

237
00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:01.830
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even though it's going to happen to</v>

238
00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:02.753
<v Speaker 5>cause he's not complaining.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

239
00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:06.280
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he is down in the third debate,</v>

240
00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:08.830
<v Speaker 3>you know he's given it time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now he's playing a strategy,</v>

241
00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:12.490
<v Speaker 3>but if he loses the second debate and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>gets down to that third debate,</v>

242
00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:15.690
<v Speaker 3>he's going to drop that Bill Clinton</v>
<v Speaker 3>blow job shit out of me.</v>

243
00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:17.380
<v Speaker 5>Nobody cares anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do they?</v>

244
00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:18.980
<v Speaker 5>About that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

245
00:11:18.981 --> 00:11:23.210
<v Speaker 5>It's interesting like immediately the</v>
<v Speaker 5>first hits when it's what Hillary and</v>

246
00:11:23.211 --> 00:11:27.650
<v Speaker 5>trump on women salon.com right away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here's why it's wrong.</v>

247
00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:29.030
<v Speaker 5>Here's why it's terrible.</v>

248
00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:33.850
<v Speaker 3>I mean if he just said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if trump said the words in succession,</v>

249
00:11:33.851 --> 00:11:38.830
<v Speaker 3>like the only reason you ever became</v>
<v Speaker 3>secretary of state was because your</v>

250
00:11:38.831 --> 00:11:42.190
<v Speaker 3>husband got a blow job in office.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

251
00:11:42.191 --> 00:11:45.430
<v Speaker 3>Like if he went for it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

252
00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.120
<v Speaker 5>do you think you could ever do that</v>
<v Speaker 5>though?</v>

253
00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:51.320
<v Speaker 5>Can you really go for it like that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can you that</v>

254
00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:55.090
<v Speaker 3>this election is different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything that we've ever seen before.</v>

255
00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:59.620
<v Speaker 3>So I think the ground rules are just</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting made and I think he'll do</v>

256
00:11:59.621 --> 00:12:02.800
<v Speaker 3>anything to get the maximum amount of</v>
<v Speaker 3>press out of this.</v>

257
00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:04.540
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my computer just froze.</v>

258
00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:07.150
<v Speaker 5>That's what happens when you start</v>
<v Speaker 5>talking shit about your computer and it</v>

259
00:12:07.151 --> 00:12:10.660
<v Speaker 5>said you need a new one fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just locked right up.</v>

260
00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:12.460
<v Speaker 5>Do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that's what happens when you talk</v>

261
00:12:12.461 --> 00:12:15.010
<v Speaker 5>shit about Hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's also what happens when you go to</v>

262
00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:16.183
<v Speaker 5>salon dog,</v>

263
00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:20.740
<v Speaker 3>all your emails or deleting themselves</v>
<v Speaker 3>right now you're talking about Hillary</v>

264
00:12:20.741 --> 00:12:21.480
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

265
00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:23.090
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was the other thing that's kind of</v>

266
00:12:23.091 --> 00:12:25.370
<v Speaker 5>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like how many emails she's deleted</v>

267
00:12:25.371 --> 00:12:27.440
<v Speaker 5>and she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why won't you release your tax returns?</v>

268
00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:32.660
<v Speaker 5>Excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you deleted 30,000 fucking yeah.</v>

269
00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.710
<v Speaker 5>How about you release you God damn</v>
<v Speaker 5>emails,</v>

270
00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:37.640
<v Speaker 5>all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How about you release the transcripts of</v>

271
00:12:37.641 --> 00:12:42.410
<v Speaker 5>those conversations that you got paid</v>
<v Speaker 5>$250,000 an hour to speak in front of</v>

272
00:12:42.411 --> 00:12:43.460
<v Speaker 5>those bankers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How about you?</v>

273
00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:45.630
<v Speaker 5>How about you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

274
00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:47.540
<v Speaker 5>what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Me,</v>

275
00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:48.430
<v Speaker 5>me</v>

276
00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:51.160
<v Speaker 3>may release.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very bizarre.</v>

277
00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:54.820
<v Speaker 3>It's very bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That email things crazy.</v>

278
00:12:54.821 --> 00:12:56.630
<v Speaker 3>She was like a hotmail account or</v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

279
00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:57.493
<v Speaker 3>She's,</v>

280
00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:02.370
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it is very strange man.</v>

281
00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:04.100
<v Speaker 5>It's all of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's very strange.</v>

282
00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:05.750
<v Speaker 5>You know what else is very strange?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

283
00:13:05.751 --> 00:13:08.810
<v Speaker 5>there's a a bunch of things that are</v>
<v Speaker 5>very strange about it all,</v>

284
00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:14.110
<v Speaker 5>but the email stuff is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you didn't know that you were deleting</v>

285
00:13:14.241 --> 00:13:17.630
<v Speaker 5>all those emails or you just did it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like how's that?</v>

286
00:13:17.631 --> 00:13:20.690
<v Speaker 5>Like you're not allowed to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's illegal.</v>

287
00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:23.300
<v Speaker 5>That's highly illegal there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When we had Mike Baker,</v>

288
00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:25.430
<v Speaker 5>the former CIA guy on the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's like,</v>

289
00:13:25.431 --> 00:13:28.400
<v Speaker 5>all I know is if I did that I would go</v>
<v Speaker 5>to jail.</v>

290
00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:30.470
<v Speaker 5>It's like I'd be in jail if I did that.</v>

291
00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:32.930
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember who I discussed in this</v>
<v Speaker 4>part of it,</v>

292
00:13:32.931 --> 00:13:36.380
<v Speaker 4>but is there any way that what the email</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing,</v>

293
00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:40.820
<v Speaker 4>like what does she's in her seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right or close to it that she's just,</v>

294
00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:42.500
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>

295
00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:46.100
<v Speaker 4>I guess competent might be the word.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She doesn't understand what's going on</v>

296
00:13:46.101 --> 00:13:48.830
<v Speaker 4>with email.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like is there any way it was in college?</v>

297
00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:53.180
<v Speaker 4>She gets it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She looks at it weird or like how people</v>

298
00:13:53.181 --> 00:13:54.320
<v Speaker 4>look at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're like old people look at their</v>

299
00:13:54.321 --> 00:13:55.820
<v Speaker 4>phones like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know how</v>

300
00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:59.810
<v Speaker 3>this is the kind of lady that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's probably a three blackberries for</v>

301
00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:01.040
<v Speaker 3>last 20 years.</v>

302
00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:05.300
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's no way she didn't know,</v>

303
00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:08.870
<v Speaker 5>but also not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the guy who was in charge of her email</v>

304
00:14:08.871 --> 00:14:11.360
<v Speaker 5>server was on reddit a couple of years</v>
<v Speaker 5>ago.</v>

305
00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:12.930
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ask him about</v>

306
00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:15.290
<v Speaker 4>how'd I get rid of stuff for your or,</v>

307
00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:18.170
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We wanted to make everything disappear</v>

308
00:14:18.171 --> 00:14:21.420
<v Speaker 5>and every lawyer who,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Huh?</v>

309
00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:24.050
<v Speaker 4>Then I guess I guess it could be adding</v>
<v Speaker 4>that to what I was just asking.</v>

310
00:14:24.051 --> 00:14:27.230
<v Speaker 4>Is there any way she didn't even know</v>
<v Speaker 4>what was going on or she had to,</v>

311
00:14:27.231 --> 00:14:31.370
<v Speaker 4>if there's no issue every way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if someone was doing it thinking this is</v>

312
00:14:31.371 --> 00:14:34.550
<v Speaker 4>what would be a great move,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I better just do this.</v>

313
00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:35.820
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

314
00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:39.430
<v Speaker 4>I gave me a good raise or my kidney,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a good position later down the line and</v>

315
00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:41.390
<v Speaker 4>found out like I took some initiative</v>
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>

316
00:14:41.391 --> 00:14:43.160
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just went in and deleted them all.</v>

317
00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:46.630
<v Speaker 5>You become as a new head of the NSA or</v>
<v Speaker 5>some shit?</v>

318
00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:48.501
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

319
00:14:48.501 --> 00:14:49.780
<v Speaker 4>I'm just curious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just,</v>

320
00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:52.130
<v Speaker 5>I mean maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean when a guy thinks</v>

321
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:57.130
<v Speaker 1>that she's gonna win and become the</v>
<v Speaker 1>president and he wants to Gig and I mean</v>

322
00:14:57.530 --> 00:14:59.270
<v Speaker 1>all of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's part of what we're sitting here</v>

323
00:14:59.271 --> 00:15:02.180
<v Speaker 1>is like all these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all connected and sort of sort of</v>

324
00:15:02.181 --> 00:15:07.070
<v Speaker 1>a weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a sneaky fucking way where they do</v>

325
00:15:07.071 --> 00:15:09.920
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of sneaky shit for each other</v>
<v Speaker 1>without even saying anything about it.</v>

326
00:15:09.921 --> 00:15:12.290
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's all like implied</v>

327
00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:15.970
<v Speaker 4>and we all seen house of cards now too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like after saying that we definitely are</v>

328
00:15:15.971 --> 00:15:16.810
<v Speaker 4>all like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

329
00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:19.720
<v Speaker 4>we think we get it because that seems so</v>
<v Speaker 4>true.</v>

330
00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.720
<v Speaker 4>I bet that's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

331
00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:25.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that shit's crazy.</v>

332
00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:27.420
<v Speaker 3>It's all real now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The house,</v>

333
00:15:27.421 --> 00:15:29.960
<v Speaker 3>the cards stuff's coming alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

334
00:15:29.961 --> 00:15:32.450
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the storyline is crazier than</v>

335
00:15:32.451 --> 00:15:35.660
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's like they realize that</v>

336
00:15:35.661 --> 00:15:39.980
<v Speaker 3>veep and veep was winning Emmy's every</v>
<v Speaker 3>year and how's the cards started</v>

337
00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:44.600
<v Speaker 3>changing the game of the mes because</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was the first thing from Netflix to</v>

338
00:15:44.601 --> 00:15:47.990
<v Speaker 3>really start.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of a sudden there was a new network</v>

339
00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.750
<v Speaker 3>at the Emmys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was like an old,</v>

340
00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:56.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's them crashing and old</v>
<v Speaker 3>party with just NBC and CBS and ABC and</v>

341
00:15:57.321 --> 00:15:57.530
<v Speaker 3>then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

342
00:15:57.530 --> 00:16:00.110
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember at the end of like</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bush's presidency that they were,</v>

343
00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:03.890
<v Speaker 4>there was TV shows made about how goofy</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was as a president?</v>

344
00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:05.360
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Comedy central head.</v>

345
00:16:05.361 --> 00:16:07.320
<v Speaker 4>What was your old made a hole.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

346
00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:10.910
<v Speaker 4>he was him for a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like how if somebody was Obama talking</v>

347
00:16:10.911 --> 00:16:13.820
<v Speaker 4>about like how goofy Obama's presidency</v>
<v Speaker 4>now would that,</v>

348
00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:14.960
<v Speaker 4>would that work?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or like,</v>

349
00:16:14.961 --> 00:16:15.750
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it wouldn't worry.</v>

350
00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:18.980
<v Speaker 4>Wouldn't even be the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if a trump presidency happened</v>

351
00:16:18.981 --> 00:16:21.170
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they could definitely make a whole new</v>

352
00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:23.900
<v Speaker 4>nightly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is what trump did day.</v>

353
00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:24.840
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>snl,</v>

354
00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:29.870
<v Speaker 3>they just announced they just signed to</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alec Baldwin to be trunk to be trump for</v>

355
00:16:30.391 --> 00:16:33.090
<v Speaker 3>the next year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is crazy.</v>

356
00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:39.090
<v Speaker 3>Then the next year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they made it like a special deal that</v>

357
00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:42.810
<v Speaker 3>they don't normally do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're paying him like a butt ton of</v>

358
00:16:42.811 --> 00:16:44.930
<v Speaker 3>money to do this trump thing.</v>

359
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:48.260
<v Speaker 1>It's all very funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

360
00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:50.010
<v Speaker 1>It's all very funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like,</v>

361
00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:54.220
<v Speaker 1>it just proves my point that I've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about for awhile that nobody who</v>

362
00:16:54.221 --> 00:16:58.110
<v Speaker 1>smart wants that job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean Hillary wants a job cause it's</v>

363
00:16:58.111 --> 00:17:02.400
<v Speaker 1>like sort of the cap of this long career</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sort of,</v>

364
00:17:02.401 --> 00:17:03.780
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

365
00:17:03.781 --> 00:17:05.580
<v Speaker 1>it's a historic moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If she wins,</v>

366
00:17:05.581 --> 00:17:09.030
<v Speaker 1>she becomes the first female president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But she's centered to criminal</v>

367
00:17:09.031 --> 00:17:12.390
<v Speaker 1>investigations and they're also saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if she doesn't win,</v>

368
00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:16.740
<v Speaker 1>it's very possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the FBI might in tighter for a bunch</v>

369
00:17:16.741 --> 00:17:17.830
<v Speaker 1>of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the bank,</v>

370
00:17:17.850 --> 00:17:20.130
<v Speaker 1>Ozzie stoked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the email stuff.</v>

371
00:17:20.131 --> 00:17:22.680
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot going on here.</v>

372
00:17:22.681 --> 00:17:26.160
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so disturbing that this is the best</v>

373
00:17:26.161 --> 00:17:28.970
<v Speaker 1>we can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Him or her,</v>

374
00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:29.813
<v Speaker 1>both of them.</v>

375
00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:34.230
<v Speaker 3>I think trump is going to pull it out</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I think people are going to want</v>

376
00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:37.720
<v Speaker 3>to shake this shit up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that people talk a lot of smack</v>

377
00:17:37.721 --> 00:17:39.910
<v Speaker 3>now and they want to seem like this and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

378
00:17:39.911 --> 00:17:44.620
<v Speaker 3>But I think when once they're in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>booth and it's just you and two boxes</v>

379
00:17:44.621 --> 00:17:47.530
<v Speaker 3>and one says trump and the other says</v>
<v Speaker 3>Clinton and you think,</v>

380
00:17:47.531 --> 00:17:50.190
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's make these next four</v>

381
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:53.940
<v Speaker 1>years a little more interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people are going to check it.</v>

382
00:17:53.941 --> 00:17:55.650
<v Speaker 1>That's what they did with that brexit</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

383
00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:57.330
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

384
00:17:57.331 --> 00:17:59.910
<v Speaker 1>I think brexit's a totally different</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation because brexit,</v>

385
00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:01.560
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friend Steve Hilton,</v>

386
00:18:01.561 --> 00:18:05.640
<v Speaker 1>remember Steve from the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve Hill was a very smart guy and used</v>

387
00:18:05.641 --> 00:18:08.790
<v Speaker 1>to be um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>David Cameron's right hand man.</v>

388
00:18:08.791 --> 00:18:10.980
<v Speaker 1>He's pro brexit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

389
00:18:10.981 --> 00:18:12.750
<v Speaker 1>it's much more complicated than people</v>
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>

390
00:18:12.751 --> 00:18:16.680
<v Speaker 1>He's like this idea that anyone from any</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of Europe can immigrate to the U K</v>

391
00:18:16.681 --> 00:18:18.570
<v Speaker 1>is disastrous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

392
00:18:18.571 --> 00:18:20.330
<v Speaker 1>it's not racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the,</v>

393
00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:24.540
<v Speaker 1>the UK has a lot to offer and if it does</v>
<v Speaker 1>in his mind,</v>

394
00:18:24.541 --> 00:18:28.500
<v Speaker 1>it is my paraphrasing him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I believe what he's saying is that</v>

395
00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:32.100
<v Speaker 1>if the UK does let everybody come in</v>
<v Speaker 1>from all over Europe and immigrated to</v>

396
00:18:32.101 --> 00:18:34.770
<v Speaker 1>the UK,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that what's going to happen is there's</v>

397
00:18:34.771 --> 00:18:36.810
<v Speaker 1>other parts of Europe does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't doing so well.</v>

398
00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:38.280
<v Speaker 1>Those people are going to go to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

399
00:18:38.281 --> 00:18:40.950
<v Speaker 1>It's doing great and it's going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking balance everything out</v>

400
00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:44.060
<v Speaker 1>eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Europe is going to,</v>

401
00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:45.870
<v Speaker 1>or UK rather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to suffer.</v>

402
00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:50.370
<v Speaker 1>While while this is happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know nearly enough to comment on</v>

403
00:18:50.371 --> 00:18:52.440
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as a complicated issue,</v>

404
00:18:52.441 --> 00:18:54.960
<v Speaker 1>but it's also one of those issues were</v>
<v Speaker 1>like super lefties,</v>

405
00:18:54.961 --> 00:18:57.870
<v Speaker 1>really progressive liberal people</v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately want to say racist.</v>

406
00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:01.020
<v Speaker 1>You don't want people to immigrate to</v>
<v Speaker 1>this country racist,</v>

407
00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.300
<v Speaker 1>you know you don't want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's what we're seeing here.</v>

408
00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:05.670
<v Speaker 1>You can't just immigrate here from</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada,</v>

409
00:19:05.671 --> 00:19:08.190
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to just move from Canada to</v>

410
00:19:08.191 --> 00:19:10.050
<v Speaker 1>the United States and we're start</v>
<v Speaker 1>working.</v>

411
00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:12.390
<v Speaker 1>I've had a bunch of friends come over</v>
<v Speaker 1>here from Canada.</v>

412
00:19:12.391 --> 00:19:17.040
<v Speaker 1>It's a long process management and easy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's like pretty white p from</v>

413
00:19:17.041 --> 00:19:20.290
<v Speaker 1>Canada that look just like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

414
00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:24.120
<v Speaker 1>we're all talking about like Mexicans</v>
<v Speaker 1>who look different or talking about</v>

415
00:19:24.121 --> 00:19:28.230
<v Speaker 1>people who look like white European</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have an incredibly hard time</v>

416
00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:29.490
<v Speaker 1>getting a green card.</v>

417
00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:30.600
<v Speaker 1>A lot of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mary,</v>

418
00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:34.160
<v Speaker 1>my friend married some guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She married some guy just to that</v>

419
00:19:34.161 --> 00:19:36.210
<v Speaker 1>Canadians and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was Canadian.</v>

420
00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:37.710
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

421
00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:39.450
<v Speaker 1>I know another dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matt.</v>

422
00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:43.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was rushing Russian factor to use</v>

423
00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:44.730
<v Speaker 1>walker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he married her just so she could</v>

424
00:19:44.731 --> 00:19:46.350
<v Speaker 1>become a citizen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

425
00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:50.280
<v Speaker 1>That's super common that you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>like go through all these meetings,</v>

426
00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:52.590
<v Speaker 1>have to make sure that you really are</v>
<v Speaker 1>husband and wife loans.</v>

427
00:19:52.591 --> 00:19:55.860
<v Speaker 1>So your finger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her show me.</v>

428
00:19:55.861 --> 00:19:59.100
<v Speaker 1>You mean do you think if trump won,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had actually built a wall?</v>

429
00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:02.070
<v Speaker 1>I think if trump won,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would hire a bunch of people to do</v>

430
00:20:02.071 --> 00:20:06.180
<v Speaker 1>the job and they would start a new</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality TV show would like him on his</v>

431
00:20:06.181 --> 00:20:09.870
<v Speaker 1>underwear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his underwear on a yacht or fireside</v>

432
00:20:09.871 --> 00:20:12.750
<v Speaker 1>chats live from the White House.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably something like that.</v>

433
00:20:12.751 --> 00:20:13.640
<v Speaker 1>It'd be hosting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

434
00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:14.483
<v Speaker 1>you make do with what?</v>

435
00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:17.100
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump channel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He figured out a way to make it a law.</v>

436
00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:22.130
<v Speaker 1>So here's what's stunning to me is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>illusion that he's some good speaker.</v>

437
00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:27.990
<v Speaker 1>His economy of words is terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He makes a point that it repeats that</v>

438
00:20:27.991 --> 00:20:29.760
<v Speaker 1>point and then he repeats that point</v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

439
00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:30.960
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said that.</v>

440
00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:32.670
<v Speaker 1>Yes I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

441
00:20:32.671 --> 00:20:35.670
<v Speaker 1>I did like the Mexican wall thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when he said that,</v>

442
00:20:35.671 --> 00:20:39.150
<v Speaker 1>I told them the wall just got 10 foot</v>
<v Speaker 1>higher.</v>

443
00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:42.000
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he was a real master speaker,</v>

444
00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:45.060
<v Speaker 1>he would go from that right into</v>
<v Speaker 1>something else.</v>

445
00:20:45.061 --> 00:20:45.661
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

446
00:20:45.661 --> 00:20:47.410
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I like.</v>

447
00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:50.020
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he rambles on too much.</v>

448
00:20:50.021 --> 00:20:55.021
<v Speaker 1>It's getting too much unprepared like</v>
<v Speaker 1>speeches like and that's what we saw in</v>

449
00:20:56.171 --> 00:20:58.750
<v Speaker 1>a debate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's in contrast to her,</v>

450
00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:01.890
<v Speaker 1>like she was very well prepared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like she,</v>

451
00:21:01.891 --> 00:21:04.090
<v Speaker 1>she nailed a lot of like very important</v>

452
00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:06.090
<v Speaker 3>points.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She set him up pretty good.</v>

453
00:21:06.091 --> 00:21:08.670
<v Speaker 3>One strategy that I noticed that she</v>
<v Speaker 3>applied,</v>

454
00:21:08.671 --> 00:21:12.780
<v Speaker 3>which I think was really smart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was she kept her answers extremely</v>

455
00:21:12.781 --> 00:21:15.810
<v Speaker 3>short,</v>
<v Speaker 3>extremely to the point.</v>

456
00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:21.080
<v Speaker 3>She did not ramble at all because she</v>
<v Speaker 3>knew that he was going to do that and</v>

457
00:21:21.781 --> 00:21:25.770
<v Speaker 3>she knew that he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she could get him to make himself look</v>

458
00:21:25.771 --> 00:21:28.620
<v Speaker 3>like a fool if she just plays it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely cool.</v>

459
00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:33.120
<v Speaker 3>Zero extra words because he does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He overuses everything.</v>

460
00:21:33.121 --> 00:21:35.880
<v Speaker 3>He repeats everything we're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said it once,</v>

461
00:21:35.881 --> 00:21:37.680
<v Speaker 3>I'll say it again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to build a wall.</v>

462
00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:39.750
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be a great wall.</v>

463
00:21:39.751 --> 00:21:42.120
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be a great big wall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People love it.</v>

464
00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:43.830
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>

00:21:45.481 --> 00:21:46.730
<v Speaker 3>We're going to make America great again.</v>

467
00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:49.940
<v Speaker 1>One thing about me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a winning temperament of winning</v>

468
00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:52.490
<v Speaker 1>temperament.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that was so embarrassing,</v>

469
00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:56.330
<v Speaker 3>really was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's certain points where he throws a</v>

470
00:21:56.331 --> 00:21:59.690
<v Speaker 3>punch that misses so hard that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

471
00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:02.600
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a huge dent.</v>

472
00:22:02.601 --> 00:22:04.340
<v Speaker 3>He would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he did it to himself.</v>

473
00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:07.750
<v Speaker 1>What was that one moment where he said a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of stupid shit in?</v>

474
00:22:07.751 --> 00:22:09.260
<v Speaker 1>Then they went to her and she went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

475
00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:12.560
<v Speaker 1>hi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she like laughed and smiled like she</v>

476
00:22:12.561 --> 00:22:14.800
<v Speaker 1>handled that so smooth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

477
00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:18.290
<v Speaker 1>This is so embarrassing that first of</v>
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

478
00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:21.020
<v Speaker 1>why does an Al Gore run?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand that.</v>

479
00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:23.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they just became president.</v>

480
00:22:23.031 --> 00:22:24.350
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why wouldn't you run again?</v>

481
00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:27.010
<v Speaker 1>Like if he ran,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would give the nomination like first.</v>

482
00:22:27.011 --> 00:22:29.330
<v Speaker 1>And everybody fucking loves me because</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to save the world,</v>

483
00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:31.730
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wanted to be the president at one point</v>

484
00:22:31.731 --> 00:22:34.010
<v Speaker 1>in time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's just like too hard on you.</v>

485
00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:37.130
<v Speaker 1>He was just too exhausting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe he,</v>

486
00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:39.410
<v Speaker 1>maybe he just doesn't want it.</v>

487
00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:42.260
<v Speaker 3>Maybe he knows how bad the whole thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

488
00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:44.930
<v Speaker 3>Maybe knows something we don't know and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he probably does.</v>

489
00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:50.280
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has made a fuck ton of money since</v>

490
00:22:50.321 --> 00:22:53.260
<v Speaker 1>he's been in white and the White House,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone said that he is going to be the</v>

491
00:22:53.261 --> 00:22:58.261
<v Speaker 1>first [inaudible] they call it cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget what they call it.</v>

492
00:22:58.601 --> 00:23:01.900
<v Speaker 1>Green billionaire or they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were talking climate change,</v>

493
00:23:01.901 --> 00:23:03.970
<v Speaker 1>billionaire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's going to be the first climate</v>

494
00:23:03.971 --> 00:23:07.900
<v Speaker 1>change advocate slash billionaire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I apparently it's just made a ton of</v>

495
00:23:07.901 --> 00:23:12.640
<v Speaker 1>money on speaking fees and all kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>other shit and he's just doing really</v>

496
00:23:12.641 --> 00:23:14.530
<v Speaker 1>well telling everybody the sky is</v>
<v Speaker 1>falling.</v>

497
00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:17.350
<v Speaker 1>He's come a long way since man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their peg,</v>

498
00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:18.700
<v Speaker 1>this man bear pig</v>

499
00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:22.190
<v Speaker 3>and south park,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had a couple of seasons where he</v>

500
00:23:22.191 --> 00:23:27.191
<v Speaker 3>was chasing a man bear pig.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is like their analogy to a global</v>

501
00:23:27.531 --> 00:23:28.364
<v Speaker 3>warming.</v>

502
00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:30.590
<v Speaker 4>13 it says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't that worth,</v>

503
00:23:30.591 --> 00:23:35.591
<v Speaker 4>is gross more than $200 million since he</v>
<v Speaker 4>lost the presidential bid in 2000 so in</v>

504
00:23:37.111 --> 00:23:41.780
<v Speaker 4>like 10 years or so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gain $200 million being the president.</v>

505
00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:43.590
<v Speaker 1>So much money and be in a pile.</v>

506
00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:47.850
<v Speaker 4>What's the dig?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lift up the whole storyline producers</v>

507
00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:51.320
<v Speaker 4>like there's so much money and making a</v>
<v Speaker 4>failing product.</v>

508
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:54.080
<v Speaker 4>They tried to make a shake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe should he play?</v>

509
00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:57.290
<v Speaker 4>What if now is it donald saw that he's</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

510
00:23:57.291 --> 00:23:58.160
<v Speaker 4>I'll just do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Al Gore.</v>

511
00:23:58.161 --> 00:23:59.570
<v Speaker 4>Did he get so close to winning?</v>

512
00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:02.240
<v Speaker 1>Not when.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we would say that.</v>

513
00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:03.470
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't want to win.</v>

514
00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:05.910
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that people believe that.</v>

515
00:24:05.911 --> 00:24:08.460
<v Speaker 1>I think they might be right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't think he expected to do</v>

516
00:24:08.461 --> 00:24:09.294
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>

517
00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:11.220
<v Speaker 1>I think he expected to get to a certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>

518
00:24:11.221 --> 00:24:13.590
<v Speaker 1>getting knocked down and just talk shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>about everybody who wins.</v>

519
00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:16.710
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talk Shit About Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz,</v>

520
00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:20.280
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I prefer Donald Trump.</v>

521
00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:21.660
<v Speaker 1>Ted Cruz.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

523
00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:25.290
<v Speaker 1>it's really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Donald Trump is preferable.</v>

524
00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:27.960
<v Speaker 1>Ted Cruz is fucking crazy.</v>

535
00:24:54.721 --> 00:24:55.554
<v Speaker 3>one time</v>

536
00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.840
<v Speaker 4>video so gross where they show the</v>
<v Speaker 4>outtakes and the one where he punched an</v>

537
00:24:59.841 --> 00:25:02.490
<v Speaker 4>elbowed his wife on stage right after he</v>

<v Speaker 4>act to just being a congressman right</v>

539
00:25:05.421 --> 00:25:07.850
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Senator Ted Turner.</v>

540
00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:10.480
<v Speaker 4>Is that what he's back to doing now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just fist,</v>

541
00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:12.980
<v Speaker 4>it's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Back into the life he had before.</v>

542
00:25:12.981 --> 00:25:14.690
<v Speaker 4>Not Everybody knows all this weird shit</v>
<v Speaker 4>about them.</v>

543
00:25:15.130 --> 00:25:16.750
<v Speaker 1>How's that work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

544
00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:19.570
<v Speaker 1>it has happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it definitely happens.</v>

545
00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:21.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's weird is it that you could run</v>

546
00:25:21.431 --> 00:25:24.850
<v Speaker 1>for president and keep that job if</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the case,</v>

547
00:25:24.851 --> 00:25:27.820
<v Speaker 1>like how the fuck you don't have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time to do your job right.</v>

548
00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:31.960
<v Speaker 1>How can you just run for president and</v>
<v Speaker 1>also hold a job in public office?</v>

549
00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:34.530
<v Speaker 4>And remember,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they were saying Bernie was going</v>

550
00:25:34.531 --> 00:25:35.364
<v Speaker 4>back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was,</v>

551
00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:41.070
<v Speaker 4>he was taking hits on the campaign show</v>
<v Speaker 4>because he was going back for all those</v>

552
00:25:41.071 --> 00:25:44.700
<v Speaker 4>things he had to do in Washington.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he would fly back every other day</v>

553
00:25:44.701 --> 00:25:47.970
<v Speaker 4>or weekly if he had tiffany go for a</v>
<v Speaker 4>vote or something instead of campaigning</v>

554
00:25:47.971 --> 00:25:51.360
<v Speaker 4>where Hillary would be off campaigning</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause she didn't have to be in those</v>

555
00:25:51.361 --> 00:25:52.230
<v Speaker 4>votes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's like,</v>

556
00:25:52.231 --> 00:25:54.390
<v Speaker 4>well why isn't she doing her job,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the secretary to stay?</v>

557
00:25:55.790 --> 00:25:58.220
<v Speaker 1>We're so lucky Bernie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that nit Bernie got through all the</v>

558
00:25:58.221 --> 00:26:01.010
<v Speaker 1>hippies would be fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there'd be going through the streets</v>

559
00:26:01.011 --> 00:26:02.000
<v Speaker 1>screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cheering.</v>

560
00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:06.270
<v Speaker 3>Well I think it'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it would be more one sided than</v>

561
00:26:06.271 --> 00:26:09.240
<v Speaker 3>it is even though Hillary supposedly be</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bernie.</v>

562
00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:12.030
<v Speaker 3>I think Bernie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as weird as it is,</v>

563
00:26:12.031 --> 00:26:14.310
<v Speaker 3>maybe I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it seems like in the battle of</v>

564
00:26:14.311 --> 00:26:18.750
<v Speaker 3>styles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Bernie would be housing trump</v>

565
00:26:18.751 --> 00:26:19.471
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

566
00:26:19.471 --> 00:26:20.430
<v Speaker 3>he would do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would do.</v>

567
00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:25.460
<v Speaker 3>I think it'd be clearly like 80 2090 10</v>
<v Speaker 3>more in there than even this.</v>

568
00:26:26.670 --> 00:26:27.331
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

569
00:26:27.331 --> 00:26:28.164
<v Speaker 3>It seems to be</v>

570
00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:32.890
<v Speaker 1>just one of the most disturbing things</v>
<v Speaker 1>about all this stuff is the Democratic</v>

571
00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:36.100
<v Speaker 1>National Committee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the DNC leaks that show that they were</v>

572
00:26:36.101 --> 00:26:41.101
<v Speaker 1>conspiring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's Bernie Sanders is really bad cause</v>

573
00:26:41.231 --> 00:26:41.771
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

574
00:26:41.771 --> 00:26:43.740
<v Speaker 1>you're literally rigging democracy.</v>

575
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:48.270
<v Speaker 5>Like your party is supposed to be the</v>
<v Speaker 5>Democratic Party,</v>

576
00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:50.340
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean you're supposed to like try to</v>

577
00:26:50.341 --> 00:26:52.110
<v Speaker 5>find,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's find the best representative.</v>

578
00:26:52.111 --> 00:26:54.420
<v Speaker 5>What do the people want?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you guys are reading it.</v>

579
00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:58.150
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You read a vrf existence,</v>

580
00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:00.380
<v Speaker 4>defend what they did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think uh,</v>

581
00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:04.980
<v Speaker 4>one might say did what they did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think this is just a thought.</v>

582
00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:09.240
<v Speaker 4>They were trying to stop someone who</v>
<v Speaker 4>wasn't a Democrat from just coming in</v>

583
00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:12.480
<v Speaker 4>and taking over their party because he's</v>
<v Speaker 4>not a Democrat as far as I've heard.</v>

584
00:27:12.481 --> 00:27:13.690
<v Speaker 4>He's just an independent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

585
00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:16.920
<v Speaker 4>Which is why he's can't take over now if</v>
<v Speaker 4>she would've got sick.</v>

586
00:27:17.290 --> 00:27:21.210
<v Speaker 4>So like there are preventing some wild</v>
<v Speaker 4>card like Donald Trump,</v>

587
00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:24.120
<v Speaker 4>I guess some guys just became super</v>
<v Speaker 4>famous and just being like,</v>

588
00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:25.740
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to fucking ruin everything you</v>

589
00:27:25.741 --> 00:27:27.300
<v Speaker 4>guys been playing on for the last 10</v>
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>

590
00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:29.210
<v Speaker 5>How does that work?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's not,</v>

591
00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:31.980
<v Speaker 5>is he does,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he couldn't he just go back and forth</v>

592
00:27:31.981 --> 00:27:33.670
<v Speaker 5>from being a Democrat or an independent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>

593
00:27:33.671 --> 00:27:33.870
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

594
00:27:33.870 --> 00:27:36.820
<v Speaker 3>See I thought he was a Democrat when she</v>
<v Speaker 3>was super</v>

595
00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:41.700
<v Speaker 4>hot coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People that actually know about politics</v>

596
00:27:41.701 --> 00:27:42.660
<v Speaker 4>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You fucking</v>

597
00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:47.730
<v Speaker 5>moron.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think Bernie had a lot of positive</v>

598
00:27:47.731 --> 00:27:48.620
<v Speaker 5>qualities.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

599
00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:51.540
<v Speaker 5>There's first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when he was in that debate with Hillary</v>

600
00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:53.130
<v Speaker 5>and he was talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh you know,</v>

601
00:27:53.131 --> 00:27:55.740
<v Speaker 5>why won't she release the transcripts</v>
<v Speaker 5>for most speeches?</v>

602
00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:58.020
<v Speaker 5>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can read my transcripts cause they</v>

603
00:27:58.021 --> 00:28:01.050
<v Speaker 5>don't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that I would not accept money from</v>

604
00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:02.200
<v Speaker 5>banks or,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

605
00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:03.240
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was interesting.</v>

606
00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:04.980
<v Speaker 5>He's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

607
00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:06.300
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think he's,</v>

608
00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:10.860
<v Speaker 5>what he's done is let people know that</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a market for that.</v>

609
00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:14.400
<v Speaker 5>There's a market for the outsider that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

610
00:28:14.401 --> 00:28:18.000
<v Speaker 5>lives a frugal life and does it really</v>
<v Speaker 5>make a ton of money.</v>

611
00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:21.540
<v Speaker 5>But his one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if anybody has ever been running for</v>

612
00:28:21.541 --> 00:28:26.541
<v Speaker 5>president and represents the average</v>
<v Speaker 5>person and I'm really ethical,</v>

613
00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:28.920
<v Speaker 5>average person,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's Bernie,</v>

614
00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:34.250
<v Speaker 5>but a lot of peoples on the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of people think that this whole</v>

615
00:28:34.981 --> 00:28:38.400
<v Speaker 5>democratic socialists thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it sort of supports people don't have a</v>

616
00:28:38.401 --> 00:28:42.360
<v Speaker 5>good work ethic and supports people who</v>
<v Speaker 5>are lazy sports people want government</v>

617
00:28:42.361 --> 00:28:45.240
<v Speaker 5>handouts and what he's trying to do</v>
<v Speaker 5>with,</v>

618
00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:48.150
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>jacking up taxes and some of the crazy</v>

619
00:28:48.151 --> 00:28:50.790
<v Speaker 5>shit that he said.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just like take from the poor,</v>

620
00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:55.440
<v Speaker 5>the rich and give to the poor and he's</v>
<v Speaker 5>is a big part of his platform was wealth</v>

621
00:28:55.441 --> 00:28:58.440
<v Speaker 5>inequality,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is a big issue with a lot of</v>

622
00:28:58.441 --> 00:28:59.670
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's understandable.</v>

623
00:28:59.671 --> 00:29:04.020
<v Speaker 5>It makes sense,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't think anybody has solved the</v>

624
00:29:04.021 --> 00:29:06.420
<v Speaker 5>riddle of how to overcome wealth</v>
<v Speaker 5>inequality.</v>

625
00:29:06.421 --> 00:29:06.510
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

626
00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:09.270
<v Speaker 3>Sweden seems to have a real knack for</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

627
00:29:09.271 --> 00:29:10.980
<v Speaker 3>Free hospitals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>free college,</v>

628
00:29:10.981 --> 00:29:13.260
<v Speaker 3>and we were there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The streets were beautiful.</v>

629
00:29:13.290 --> 00:29:16.500
<v Speaker 3>Everything's clean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>free public transportation,</v>

630
00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:19.020
<v Speaker 3>Free Hospital,</v>
<v Speaker 3>street college was the other thing.</v>

631
00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:20.220
<v Speaker 3>Something else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

632
00:29:20.221 --> 00:29:23.010
<v Speaker 3>those things were already much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything's free and they pay,</v>

633
00:29:23.011 --> 00:29:26.490
<v Speaker 3>what was it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think 30 or 40% tax.</v>

634
00:29:26.491 --> 00:29:31.491
<v Speaker 3>I don't know the exact I at all numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they pay a very high sales tax on</v>

635
00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:35.070
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You pay it on everything.</v>

636
00:29:35.071 --> 00:29:38.040
<v Speaker 3>New pair of shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you pay me a new tee shirt.</v>

637
00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:39.060
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pay me</v>

638
00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:42.370
<v Speaker 4>Sweden.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a beautiful</v>

639
00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:46.550
<v Speaker 3>2015,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 that's an a world superpower.</v>

640
00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:49.760
<v Speaker 5>That's an army that can take police and</v>
<v Speaker 5>even edit your time.</v>

641
00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:52.910
<v Speaker 5>That's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The number of people is a good point</v>

642
00:29:52.911 --> 00:29:55.640
<v Speaker 5>too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like when you get to like 300 million</v>

643
00:29:55.641 --> 00:29:59.300
<v Speaker 5>people and you start talking about like</v>
<v Speaker 5>universal basic income,</v>

644
00:29:59.770 --> 00:30:02.120
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is an interesting conversation</v>

645
00:30:02.121 --> 00:30:03.980
<v Speaker 5>that keeps getting brought up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

646
00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:04.821
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

647
00:30:04.821 --> 00:30:07.130
<v Speaker 5>that was what Eddie Wong brought up on</v>
<v Speaker 5>the podcast.</v>

648
00:30:07.131 --> 00:30:08.610
<v Speaker 5>We started talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's not,</v>

649
00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:10.850
<v Speaker 5>it was crazy initially.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then I've read some of the things</v>

650
00:30:10.851 --> 00:30:15.440
<v Speaker 5>that some economists have said and some,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some people believe that if you just</v>

651
00:30:15.650 --> 00:30:19.820
<v Speaker 5>gave people certain amount of money</v>
<v Speaker 5>where there's $12,000 a year more or</v>

652
00:30:19.821 --> 00:30:23.090
<v Speaker 5>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that it would alleviate the stress of</v>

653
00:30:23.091 --> 00:30:26.030
<v Speaker 5>paying bills.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People would have like a certain amount</v>

654
00:30:26.031 --> 00:30:28.520
<v Speaker 5>of income.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it would be far less crime and then</v>

655
00:30:28.521 --> 00:30:31.790
<v Speaker 5>the government would need to spend far</v>
<v Speaker 5>less money because it'd be far less</v>

656
00:30:31.791 --> 00:30:33.890
<v Speaker 5>issues,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which I think is fascinating.</v>

657
00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:35.990
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if it's right,</v>

658
00:30:35.991 --> 00:30:37.480
<v Speaker 5>but I like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

659
00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:41.600
<v Speaker 5>it's very out of the box and when a</v>
<v Speaker 5>country's is fucked up as we are,</v>

660
00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:46.130
<v Speaker 5>we have these ghettos like a with</v>
<v Speaker 5>Michael Wood was talking about with</v>

661
00:30:46.131 --> 00:30:49.430
<v Speaker 5>Baltimore where there just is systemic</v>
<v Speaker 5>racism,</v>

662
00:30:49.431 --> 00:30:52.940
<v Speaker 5>systemic ghettos where they've like made</v>
<v Speaker 5>it so like black people cannot buy</v>

663
00:30:52.941 --> 00:30:57.500
<v Speaker 5>houses any place other than these areas</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that these areas outside of that are</v>

664
00:30:57.501 --> 00:30:59.690
<v Speaker 5>only for white people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like when you have like something like</v>

665
00:30:59.691 --> 00:31:02.900
<v Speaker 5>that that existed until like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think you said the 1960s is when those</v>

666
00:31:02.901 --> 00:31:04.730
<v Speaker 5>laws were still in at,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in in effect,</v>

667
00:31:05.090 --> 00:31:06.230
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

668
00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:09.530
<v Speaker 5>I don't know at least that I would say</v>
<v Speaker 5>at least that.</v>

669
00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:14.390
<v Speaker 5>So that's my lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was born in 67 so during my lifetime</v>

670
00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:18.320
<v Speaker 5>these laws were being enforced,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is just fucking crazy.</v>

671
00:31:18.321 --> 00:31:21.170
<v Speaker 5>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you have a system that's that nuts,</v>

672
00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:24.200
<v Speaker 5>like you got to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you got to have a radical plan to fix</v>

673
00:31:24.201 --> 00:31:24.290
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

674
00:31:24.290 --> 00:31:28.220
<v Speaker 3>So there was a neighborhood outside of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Baltimore that was only white people.</v>

675
00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:30.470
<v Speaker 3>You could not buy a house there if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're black,</v>

676
00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:33.100
<v Speaker 3>we would not sell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have a d at the address to this.</v>

677
00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:37.160
<v Speaker 3>How dare you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought you were in a fucking black</v>

678
00:31:37.161 --> 00:31:38.330
<v Speaker 3>girls man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that a new thing?</v>

679
00:31:38.331 --> 00:31:39.710
<v Speaker 3>Just kidding guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just kidding.</v>

680
00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:40.823
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your new thing.</v>

681
00:31:41.030 --> 00:31:44.120
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think black girls do have a warmer</v>

682
00:31:44.121 --> 00:31:46.490
<v Speaker 3>vagina than white girls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much warmer?</v>

683
00:31:46.790 --> 00:31:49.610
<v Speaker 3>I think just a few degrees warmer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you took a white vagina and put</v>

684
00:31:49.611 --> 00:31:51.320
<v Speaker 3>it in the microwave for like five</v>
<v Speaker 3>seconds.</v>

685
00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:56.750
<v Speaker 3>And how many black girls have you had</v>
<v Speaker 3>sex with?</v>

686
00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:02.200
<v Speaker 3>I noticed there was only only two and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>was a one summer about three years ago.</v>

687
00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:05.090
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I noticed it with both of them and</v>

688
00:32:05.091 --> 00:32:07.730
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't even at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just the same summer.</v>

689
00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:11.180
<v Speaker 3>I was no setting for my friend in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hollywood hills and they'd be,</v>

690
00:32:11.181 --> 00:32:15.110
<v Speaker 3>it just felt warm or cause you were so</v>
<v Speaker 3>excited to be bringing a black chick</v>

691
00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:19.490
<v Speaker 3>that your dick was going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Woo pretty much was either that or they</v>

692
00:32:19.491 --> 00:32:24.491
<v Speaker 3>had fevers and they just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every second these girls with malaria,</v>

693
00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:31.510
<v Speaker 3>they coughing a lot and then they were</v>
<v Speaker 3>when mine.</v>

694
00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:32.543
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

695
00:32:37.790 --> 00:32:40.440
<v Speaker 5>It's so silly.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 5>with their darker than me?</v>

699
00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:53.500
<v Speaker 6>I noticed that</v>

700
00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:56.460
<v Speaker 5>one time when I lived in Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 5>it was like the winter I was,</v>

<v Speaker 5>in the sun.</v>

705
00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:08.640
<v Speaker 5>And A,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I hooked up with this black girl I met</v>

706
00:33:08.641 --> 00:33:10.200
<v Speaker 5>in Pittsfield,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Massachusetts.</v>

707
00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:11.850
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Which is way out in the middle of</v>

708
00:33:11.851 --> 00:33:13.950
<v Speaker 5>nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And she wasn't black like beyond,</v>

709
00:33:13.951 --> 00:33:16.560
<v Speaker 5>say black.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She was black like check Congo,</v>

<v Speaker 5>light of the television,</v>

713
00:33:25.410 --> 00:33:27.900
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the TV's on and I'm having sex with</v>

715
00:33:33.330 --> 00:33:35.700
<v Speaker 5>We're going at it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I remember thinking about it cause</v>

716
00:33:35.701 --> 00:33:37.140
<v Speaker 5>we were doing it doggy style.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember,</v>

00:33:37.141 --> 00:33:39.330
<v Speaker 5>look down at it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she had an incredible body.</v>

718
00:33:39.331 --> 00:33:40.800
<v Speaker 5>All my God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this girl,</v>

719
00:33:40.801 --> 00:33:42.600
<v Speaker 5>to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like one of the best bodies I've</v>

720
00:33:42.601 --> 00:33:43.434
<v Speaker 5>ever seen in my life.</v>

721
00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:45.990
<v Speaker 5>It was like cartoonish or body was</v>
<v Speaker 5>incredible.</v>

722
00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:47.790
<v Speaker 5>But I remember to this day thinking</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

723
00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:49.770
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

<v Speaker 5>we'll like,</v>

725
00:33:51.301 --> 00:33:54.900

<v Speaker 5>I'm so white and I'm not even that</v>

<v Speaker 5>Mostly.</v>

728
00:33:57.390 --> 00:34:01.050
<v Speaker 5>But I mean it just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the contrast was so interesting.</v>

729
00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:03.890
<v Speaker 5>But the girls that I have had sex with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it just,</v>

730
00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:05.920
<v Speaker 5>maybe it's a coincidence,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe sound,</v>

731
00:34:05.921 --> 00:34:07.680
<v Speaker 5>but all the black shirts that had sex</v>
<v Speaker 5>with,</v>

732
00:34:07.681 --> 00:34:11.160
<v Speaker 5>we're fucking freaks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like they were so much more</v>

733
00:34:11.161 --> 00:34:12.450
<v Speaker 5>enthusiastic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

734
00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:16.290
<v Speaker 5>So much more vocal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so much more aggressive.</v>

735
00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:18.030
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like Kenya,</v>

<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hold that good tech.</v>

738
00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:25.350
<v Speaker 5>Like whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jesus.</v>

739
00:34:26.730 --> 00:34:27.570
<v Speaker 5>Plus,</v>
<v Speaker 5>while it's happening,</v>

740
00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:28.820
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as a comic hall,</v>

741
00:34:28.821 --> 00:34:29.820
<v Speaker 5>stuff like that's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

742
00:34:29.850 --> 00:34:31.140
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember this one.</v>

743
00:34:31.141 --> 00:34:32.320
<v Speaker 5>If it's a bit near,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

744
00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:33.560
<v Speaker 5>just take it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

745
00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:36.720
<v Speaker 5>I could never make a bit out of it</v>
<v Speaker 5>though because it seems so phrases.</v>

746
00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:38.700
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just even say how dark she was and how</v>

747
00:34:38.701 --> 00:34:40.020
<v Speaker 5>wide I was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was like,</v>

748
00:34:40.021 --> 00:34:43.980
<v Speaker 5>how do I say this without sounding,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's just,</v>

749
00:34:44.130 --> 00:34:47.640
<v Speaker 5>it's such a racially charged thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like even if you're,</v>

750
00:34:47.641 --> 00:34:52.641
<v Speaker 5>if it's not the jokes not racist or the</v>
<v Speaker 5>discussion of the subject is not racist.</v>

751
00:34:52.890 --> 00:34:55.500
<v Speaker 5>It's so racially charged,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're better off just leaving it alone.</v>

752
00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:57.690
<v Speaker 5>Plus,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the things I've noticed,</v>

753
00:34:58.290 --> 00:35:01.100
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had a conversation with this girl that</v>

754
00:35:01.110 --> 00:35:03.450
<v Speaker 5>I was dating at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

755
00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:05.700
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she did like,</v>

756
00:35:05.701 --> 00:35:07.110
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was one of those years have sex with</v>

<v Speaker 5>Maybe you're having sex with a black</v>

759
00:35:11.011 --> 00:35:11.671
<v Speaker 5>girl.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

760
00:35:11.671 --> 00:35:12.580
<v Speaker 5>A couple.</v>

761
00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:14.040
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those kinds of conversations.</v>

762
00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:16.230
<v Speaker 5>But I was telling her how dark this girl</v>
<v Speaker 5>was.</v>

763
00:35:16.231 --> 00:35:19.890
<v Speaker 5>Like she was getting upset</v>
<v Speaker 5>so she was dark.</v>

764
00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:24.630
<v Speaker 5>But I mean it's like if I asked her,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know like how bill,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

774

<v Speaker 5>Like is the shade that offended or the</v>

775
00:35:49.501 --> 00:35:53.190
<v Speaker 5>most though she's racist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's from Staten Island town.</v>

776
00:35:53.250 --> 00:35:55.650
<v Speaker 5>That'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tiny girl from standing out.</v>

777
00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:57.520
<v Speaker 5>Racist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oof.</v>

778
00:35:57.670 --> 00:35:59.160
<v Speaker 5>Two more now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Park row</v>

779
00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:06.240
<v Speaker 5>one day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But here's the thing,</v>

780
00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:07.370
<v Speaker 5>here's what's fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

781
00:36:07.371 --> 00:36:10.380
<v Speaker 5>like someone said to me once,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one day everyone's going to be like mix</v>

782
00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:15.560
<v Speaker 5>because like right now the only reason</v>
<v Speaker 5>why race existed in such specific like</v>

783
00:36:16.321 --> 00:36:21.090
<v Speaker 5>distinctive ways like Chinese people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>African people,</v>

784
00:36:21.091 --> 00:36:26.091
<v Speaker 5>like really distinctive differences is</v>
<v Speaker 5>because those people very rarely met</v>

785
00:36:26.221 --> 00:36:29.850
<v Speaker 5>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But now everybody goes everywhere.</v>

786
00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:33.390
<v Speaker 5>And a place like the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is essentially just a melting pot</v>

787
00:36:33.391 --> 00:36:36.390
<v Speaker 5>of immigrants,</v>
<v Speaker 5>does own the only people that were here</v>

788
00:36:36.391 --> 00:36:41.310
<v Speaker 5>originally where the indigenous people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but even the indigenous people came over</v>

789
00:36:41.311 --> 00:36:43.770
<v Speaker 5>from Asia,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they all came on the bering strait.</v>

790
00:36:43.770 --> 00:36:47.730
<v Speaker 5>I mean all the people that live here</v>
<v Speaker 5>that we think of as native Americans,</v>

791
00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:51.120
<v Speaker 5>they've done like these DNA tests on</v>
<v Speaker 5>them will think if they come from</v>

792
00:36:51.121 --> 00:36:53.190
<v Speaker 5>fucking Siberia.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

793
00:36:53.191 --> 00:36:54.690
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's really funny now,</v>

794
00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:59.720
<v Speaker 5>who did the DNA test to find that out?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So really rich dude who was a mormon who</v>

795
00:36:59.851 --> 00:37:01.520
<v Speaker 5>wanted approve.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of,</v>

796
00:37:01.521 --> 00:37:06.060
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Joseph Smith's statements was that the</v>

797
00:37:06.061 --> 00:37:09.450
<v Speaker 5>American Indians were in fact the lost</v>
<v Speaker 5>tribe of Israel.</v>

798
00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:14.310
<v Speaker 5>And he thought that he could prove that</v>
<v Speaker 5>and prove that the,</v>

799
00:37:14.311 --> 00:37:16.680
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Mormon doctrine that the book of</v>

800
00:37:16.681 --> 00:37:20.460
<v Speaker 5>Mormon was correct.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so he spent all this money to get</v>

801
00:37:20.461 --> 00:37:23.160
<v Speaker 5>the DNA test done,</v>
<v Speaker 5>turned out there from fucking Siberia</v>

802
00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:25.200
<v Speaker 5>because the kids are not high.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oops.</v>

803
00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:27.930
<v Speaker 5>Did he tried to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

804
00:37:27.931 --> 00:37:30.360
<v Speaker 5>I don't think you can.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think scientists let you hide</v>

805
00:37:30.361 --> 00:37:34.590
<v Speaker 5>the data and to get it done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe some extra money to get it fucked</v>

806
00:37:34.591 --> 00:37:35.370
<v Speaker 5>up.</v>

807
00:37:35.370 --> 00:37:38.520
<v Speaker 5>A real lab that's doing those kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 5>DNA test.</v>

808
00:37:38.521 --> 00:37:42.090
<v Speaker 5>I would imagine that would be like an</v>
<v Speaker 5>important finding and they would want to</v>

809
00:37:42.091 --> 00:37:43.420
<v Speaker 5>release it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would again,</v>

810
00:37:43.490 --> 00:37:48.490
<v Speaker 5>oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Scientists could cover up data then we</v>

811
00:37:48.511 --> 00:37:53.511
<v Speaker 5>wouldn't know that mushrooms can care.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Chronic depression from the studies.</v>

812
00:37:54.001 --> 00:37:57.420
<v Speaker 5>That was a Carnegie Parkins John Hopkins</v>
<v Speaker 5>University.</v>

813
00:37:57.421 --> 00:38:00.360
<v Speaker 5>This has been a few studies now are</v>
<v Speaker 5>showing that.</v>

814
00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:02.460
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I no man,</v>

815
00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:05.940
<v Speaker 5>it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's everybody has come.</v>

816
00:38:05.941 --> 00:38:09.000
<v Speaker 5>What I was going to say is everybody has</v>
<v Speaker 5>come to the United States from somewhere</v>

817
00:38:09.001 --> 00:38:09.834
<v Speaker 5>else.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

818
00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:13.560
<v Speaker 5>And then one day conceivably that people</v>
<v Speaker 5>keep fucking,</v>

819
00:38:13.950 --> 00:38:15.840
<v Speaker 5>that we're all going to be like one kind</v>
<v Speaker 5>of thing,</v>

820
00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:19.080
<v Speaker 5>one shade.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're all be like this sort of Tan that,</v>

821
00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:21.630
<v Speaker 5>but the problem with that is it's kind</v>
<v Speaker 5>of cool.</v>

822
00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:24.930
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what do you walk down the street and you</v>

823
00:38:24.931 --> 00:38:29.520
<v Speaker 5>see this dude who's black flag coal and</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's got a little Chinese girlfriend and</v>

824
00:38:29.521 --> 00:38:30.960
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whoa boy,</v>

825
00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:33.790
<v Speaker 5>I want to watch this to do it.</v>

826
00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:35.740
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

827
00:38:35.741 --> 00:38:37.930
<v Speaker 5>it's kind of fun that people are</v>
<v Speaker 5>different,</v>

828
00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:41.930
<v Speaker 5>but we can handle that fun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some people can't handle it right.</v>

829
00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:43.630
<v Speaker 5>Without being racist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And not only that,</v>

830
00:38:43.631 --> 00:38:47.560
<v Speaker 5>because of racists,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we can't make racial jokes.</v>

831
00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:52.920
<v Speaker 5>Like if you can't even talk about like</v>
<v Speaker 5>pretty obvious differences in the races</v>

832
00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:58.300
<v Speaker 5>without being labeled a racist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like things that are really just so</v>

833
00:38:58.301 --> 00:39:01.000
<v Speaker 5>obvious and less.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're making fun of white people.</v>

834
00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:03.790
<v Speaker 5>You can make fun of white people till</v>
<v Speaker 5>the cows come home.</v>

835
00:39:03.791 --> 00:39:05.860
<v Speaker 5>Nobody gives a shit because why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>People are,</v>

836
00:39:05.861 --> 00:39:08.620
<v Speaker 5>the majority white people were thought</v>
<v Speaker 5>of as the oppressors.</v>

837
00:39:08.830 --> 00:39:10.660
<v Speaker 5>White people owned slaves,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

838
00:39:10.661 --> 00:39:11.590
<v Speaker 5>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 5>et cetera.</v>

839
00:39:11.830 --> 00:39:13.780
<v Speaker 5>So you can shit on white people all day</v>
<v Speaker 5>long.</v>

840
00:39:13.781 --> 00:39:16.300
<v Speaker 5>Nobody ever gives you a hard time for</v>
<v Speaker 5>shitting on white people.</v>

841
00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:17.273
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

842
00:39:17.350 --> 00:39:18.190
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're the,</v>

843
00:39:18.191 --> 00:39:20.080
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

844
00:39:20.081 --> 00:39:22.270
<v Speaker 3>it's in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's no fun to make fun of white people</v>

845
00:39:22.271 --> 00:39:23.290
<v Speaker 3>either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

846
00:39:23.350 --> 00:39:24.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just sorta like,</v>

847
00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:26.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

848
00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:28.190
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's always no fun to make fun of</v>

849
00:39:28.191 --> 00:39:30.620
<v Speaker 5>someone who,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

850
00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:34.010
<v Speaker 5>when someone is in charge or someone is</v>
<v Speaker 5>on the,</v>

851
00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:34.401
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

852
00:39:34.401 --> 00:39:35.730
<v Speaker 5>someone has power,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

853
00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:37.820
<v Speaker 5>Those are the people you're supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 5>just fuck with.</v>

854
00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:40.160
<v Speaker 5>Cause it's useful to punch up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

855
00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:42.720
<v Speaker 5>You should always punch up and comedy</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tony.</v>

856
00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:44.060
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You should always punch up,</v>

857
00:39:44.690 --> 00:39:49.490
<v Speaker 5>which is not necessarily true because</v>
<v Speaker 5>sometimes the people like my purse,</v>

858
00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:51.950
<v Speaker 5>my classic example of why punching up as</v>
<v Speaker 5>an,</v>

859
00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:55.580
<v Speaker 5>it's funny as the sand Kansas bit about</v>
<v Speaker 5>starving people in Africa and one of the</v>

860
00:39:55.581 --> 00:39:58.670
<v Speaker 5>greatest bits of all time and it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>literally talking about starving</v>

861
00:39:58.671 --> 00:40:00.500
<v Speaker 5>children.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking hilarious.</v>

862
00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:04.910
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that like when,</v>

863
00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:07.430
<v Speaker 5>when someone is in a position of power</v>
<v Speaker 5>though,</v>

864
00:40:07.610 --> 00:40:12.610
<v Speaker 5>it's open season on them as opposed to</v>
<v Speaker 5>someone who comes from a marginalized</v>

865
00:40:12.771 --> 00:40:13.760
<v Speaker 5>group.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what?</v>

866
00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:17.600
<v Speaker 5>Even if it's something funny or if</v>
<v Speaker 5>something from a marginalized group and</v>

867
00:40:17.601 --> 00:40:19.940
<v Speaker 5>it's a really funny thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you talk about it,</v>

868
00:40:19.941 --> 00:40:22.170
<v Speaker 5>you can get in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

869
00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:24.540
<v Speaker 3>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

870
00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:28.620
<v Speaker 3>have you ever gotten in trouble for</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything racial and like,</v>

871
00:40:28.621 --> 00:40:29.910
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing the stand up,</v>

872
00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:33.930
<v Speaker 3>like did you ever cross the line or</v>
<v Speaker 3>crowd wise or anything?</v>

873
00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:35.100
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

874
00:40:35.101 --> 00:40:38.910
<v Speaker 5>I never got in trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I've never,</v>

875
00:40:38.911 --> 00:40:42.840
<v Speaker 5>I've never been like a a racial comic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

876
00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:44.090
<v Speaker 5>That's not really my thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

877
00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:46.350
<v Speaker 5>like Russell,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like we were talking about the other</v>

878
00:40:46.350 --> 00:40:47.220
<v Speaker 5>day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like Russell Peters,</v>

879
00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:51.390
<v Speaker 5>Russel's half his act is about race,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he can get away with it because he's</v>

880
00:40:51.391 --> 00:40:54.000
<v Speaker 5>Indian.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cause he's brown because he's Indian.</v>

881
00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:55.080
<v Speaker 5>She's the,</v>

882
00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:58.270
<v Speaker 3>the chosen one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a brown guy from Canada that</v>

883
00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:00.550
<v Speaker 3>America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he's got it all.</v>

884
00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:03.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He can make fun of everything and be</v>

885
00:41:03.011 --> 00:41:04.310
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

886
00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:05.950
<v Speaker 3>what do you want?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tom Brown,</v>

887
00:41:06.050 --> 00:41:09.110
<v Speaker 5>Brown from Asia just got the whole thing</v>
<v Speaker 5>wrapped up.</v>

888
00:41:09.290 --> 00:41:11.150
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's got this thing on lock.</v>

889
00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:12.453
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

890
00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:13.160
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>India,</v>

891
00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:13.993
<v Speaker 5>Asia,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

892
00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:15.260
<v Speaker 5>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

893
00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:19.370
<v Speaker 5>I had to ask.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was sure what I said.</v>

894
00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:20.460
<v Speaker 5>Then after I said it was okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was like,</v>

895
00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:21.160
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

896

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

897

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 5>That's what's weird.</v>

900
00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:27.490
<v Speaker 5>That's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

901
00:41:27.730 --> 00:41:29.770
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Russia is part of Asia.</v>

902
00:41:30.070 --> 00:41:30.910
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

903
00:41:31.090 --> 00:41:33.740
<v Speaker 5>It's just the most people that live in</v>
<v Speaker 5>Russia don't all live in the Asian part.</v>

904
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:35.000
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Live in the European.</v>

905
00:41:35.001 --> 00:41:35.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

906
00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:37.110
<v Speaker 5>It's like Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Egypt,</v>

907
00:41:37.111 --> 00:41:40.590
<v Speaker 5>Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody thinks of Egypt as the Middle</v>

908
00:41:40.590 --> 00:41:41.430
<v Speaker 5>East.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

909
00:41:41.431 --> 00:41:43.230
<v Speaker 5>it Kinda is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's also Africa.</v>

910
00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:44.730
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

911
00:41:44.730 --> 00:41:46.440
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My mind is blown right now.</v>

912
00:41:46.830 --> 00:41:48.930
<v Speaker 5>Egypt is a part of Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know it's fucked up.</v>

913
00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:53.130
<v Speaker 5>When I went to Italy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Egypt like right there,</v>

914
00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:55.650
<v Speaker 5>like you're fucking swim to it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not really,</v>

915
00:41:55.651 --> 00:41:59.010
<v Speaker 5>but I mean the d,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the distance between Egypt and Italy is</v>

916
00:41:59.011 --> 00:41:59.880
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's fucking hop,</v>

917
00:41:59.881 --> 00:42:03.270
<v Speaker 5>skip and a jump.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How it's how the Moore's invaded Sicily.</v>

918
00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:05.670
<v Speaker 5>They were right there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They got of raft,</v>

919
00:42:05.970 --> 00:42:07.830
<v Speaker 5>they went over and a raft.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He just raped everybody.</v>

920
00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:10.710
<v Speaker 5>It's real close</v>

921
00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:14.720
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's how people started getting</v>

922
00:42:14.721 --> 00:42:19.721
<v Speaker 4>browner Italians if every race or aren't</v>
<v Speaker 4>did the differences in race in some</v>

923
00:42:22.281 --> 00:42:25.180
<v Speaker 4>situations based off of geography.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

924
00:42:25.550 --> 00:42:28.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's why I was just kind of think</v>

925
00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:29.230
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was thinking that thought too,</v>

926
00:42:29.231 --> 00:42:30.920
<v Speaker 4>that everyone will end up looking the</v>
<v Speaker 4>same color,</v>

927
00:42:30.921 --> 00:42:32.690
<v Speaker 4>but that's a fairly well live in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>same place.</v>

928
00:42:32.691 --> 00:42:34.610
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the sort of people live there.</v>

929
00:42:34.611 --> 00:42:35.910
<v Speaker 4>They declared that ended up being</v>
<v Speaker 4>darker.</v>

930
00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:37.730
<v Speaker 4>They'll be well live further away from</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

931
00:42:37.870 --> 00:42:39.970
<v Speaker 5>That's good point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But how come everybody in Arizona so</v>

00:42:39.971 --> 00:42:42.560
<v Speaker 5>fucking white in there and stay inside</v>
<v Speaker 5>away from the sun?</v>

933
00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:43.960
<v Speaker 5>He punched Chicago cargo or dark.</v>

00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:47.990
<v Speaker 5>See what I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's no reflection and go to the south</v>

936
00:42:47.991 --> 00:42:51.500
<v Speaker 5>side of Chicago and then go to</v>
<v Speaker 5>Scottsdale and you go like,</v>

937
00:42:51.501 --> 00:42:56.501
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck is going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean the origins of those people.</v>

938
00:42:58.071 --> 00:42:58.850
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for sure.</v>

939
00:42:58.850 --> 00:43:02.030
<v Speaker 5>If you lived in a continent like Africa</v>
<v Speaker 5>where the sun's beating down on you all</v>

940
00:43:02.031 --> 00:43:03.800
<v Speaker 5>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you need more Melanin to protect you</v>

941
00:43:03.801 --> 00:43:05.900
<v Speaker 5>from the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you lived in a place,</v>

942
00:43:05.901 --> 00:43:07.250
<v Speaker 5>it's always like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

943
00:43:07.251 --> 00:43:11.120
<v Speaker 5>Norway or something like that where it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>very little sun nor we have very little</v>

944
00:43:11.121 --> 00:43:12.700
<v Speaker 5>sun I would imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

945
00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:15.710
<v Speaker 5>I slammed all fucking white people.</v>

946
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:20.020
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were talking and I forget someone was</v>

947
00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:25.040
<v Speaker 4>on the podcast this week and the Tower</v>
<v Speaker 4>of Babel came up in giants in new West.</v>

948
00:43:25.170 --> 00:43:25.970
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was.</v>

949
00:43:25.970 --> 00:43:28.730
<v Speaker 4>I wrote something down when I came up to</v>
<v Speaker 4>Santa thought that,</v>

950
00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:30.260
<v Speaker 4>and I'm not sure I could've looked it</v>
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>

951
00:43:30.261 --> 00:43:31.850
<v Speaker 4>I guess that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

952
00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:35.850
<v Speaker 4>I wrote down like Internet and English</v>
<v Speaker 4>could be,</v>

953
00:43:35.870 --> 00:43:37.500
<v Speaker 4>that was my phone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Could be that,</v>

954
00:43:37.501 --> 00:43:39.630
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

955
00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:43.050
<v Speaker 4>that time Babel sing senior language.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I guess what I mean when Internet</v>

956
00:43:43.051 --> 00:43:48.051
<v Speaker 4>English is that like aren't most</v>
<v Speaker 4>websites coded and English because of</v>

957
00:43:49.830 --> 00:43:54.830
<v Speaker 4>the Internet started and like over here</v>
<v Speaker 4>the West where people all speak English</v>

958
00:43:55.350 --> 00:43:56.760
<v Speaker 4>to me like html.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

959
00:43:56.761 --> 00:43:59.820
<v Speaker 4>Like wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a Chinese website has to be coded in</v>

960
00:43:59.821 --> 00:44:04.080
<v Speaker 4>html and they could have some program</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's translating their stuff that's</v>

961
00:44:04.081 --> 00:44:05.530
<v Speaker 4>easier for them to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>

962
00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:10.820
<v Speaker 4>Was getting into my head like that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>almost in some way like 15 or 30 years</v>

963
00:44:10.981 --> 00:44:13.380
<v Speaker 4>that most of the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a worldwide will all be</v>

964
00:44:13.381 --> 00:44:15.840
<v Speaker 4>communicating and us with a similar</v>
<v Speaker 4>language.</v>

965
00:44:16.110 --> 00:44:18.060
<v Speaker 4>I said that to my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's kind of why I brought it up and</v>

966
00:44:18.061 --> 00:44:22.100
<v Speaker 4>he asked if I ever heard of Esperanto.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You ever heard of this language called s</v>

967
00:44:22.101 --> 00:44:22.820
<v Speaker 4>upper antone?</v>

968

969
00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:25.280

<v Speaker 5>It helped</v>

970
00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:30.300
<v Speaker 4>in 1887 by some guy that was literally</v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to create one language and it's,</v>

971
00:44:31.830 --> 00:44:31.980
<v Speaker 4>if</v>

972
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:35.790
<v Speaker 7>you look it up now and you can find out</v>
<v Speaker 7>that it's not dead and there's the more,</v>

973
00:44:35.791 --> 00:44:40.740
<v Speaker 7>the fastest growing languages apparently</v>
<v Speaker 7>for people learning to speak something</v>

974
00:44:40.741 --> 00:44:41.574
<v Speaker 7>different.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

1016
00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:49.680
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1017
00:46:49.681 --> 00:46:51.840
<v Speaker 7>thought that maybe Hitler escaped to</v>
<v Speaker 7>South America.</v>

00:46:53.310 --> 00:46:56.340
<v Speaker 7>Wouldn't that be great?</v>

<v Speaker 7>to South America.</v>

1022
00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:07.740
<v Speaker 7>Wouldn't it be great if people that went</v>
<v Speaker 7>out looking for Hitler ended up finding</v>

1023
00:47:07.741 --> 00:47:12.090

1032
00:47:40.721 --> 00:47:43.120
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they could live.</v>

1033
00:47:43.121 --> 00:47:47.590
<v Speaker 1>Someone could live here and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could live 10 miles away and it'd be a</v>

1034
00:47:47.591 --> 00:47:52.591
<v Speaker 1>totally different language and they call</v>
<v Speaker 1>their tribes mobs.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They called it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they call my mob.</v>

1036
00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:58.090
<v Speaker 1>That's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you have one mob and then you have</v>

1037
00:47:58.091 --> 00:48:02.140
<v Speaker 1>another mob that's like 1520 kilometers</v>
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like how many different languages?</v>

1040
00:48:06.881 --> 00:48:08.830
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck thousands.</v>

1041
00:48:09.370 --> 00:48:11.200
<v Speaker 1>I was like thousands.</v>

<v Speaker 1>like nobody knows that language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody knows their history,</v>

1044
00:48:15.491 --> 00:48:17.800
<v Speaker 1>it's all gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was this one cave,</v>

1045
00:48:17.830 --> 00:48:20.140
<v Speaker 1>like literally a fucking cave for these</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were living in.</v>

1046
00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:24.220
<v Speaker 1>And they were apparently when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1047
00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:26.950
<v Speaker 1>they settled this area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the aborigines obviously were there</v>

1048
00:48:26.951 --> 00:48:29.080
<v Speaker 1>first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when the white people came and</v>

1049
00:48:29.081 --> 00:48:31.960
<v Speaker 1>settled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they raising cattle,</v>

1050
00:48:31.961 --> 00:48:34.750
<v Speaker 1>the aborigines were stealing the cattle</v>
<v Speaker 1>to them.</v>

1051
00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:37.240
<v Speaker 1>They didn't think of it as stealing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They thought it was a ho,</v>

1052
00:48:37.241 --> 00:48:38.230
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's some food,</v>

1053
00:48:38.231 --> 00:48:41.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they ate the cows and the</v>

1054
00:48:41.441 --> 00:48:44.720
<v Speaker 1>ranchers got pissed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they brought them food and poison</v>

1055
00:48:44.721 --> 00:48:48.280
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's this cave that he found that</v>

1056
00:48:48.310 --> 00:48:50.890
<v Speaker 1>he took all these photographs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adam did office site,</v>

1057
00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:55.180
<v Speaker 1>you probably find it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on Adam Green trees of photography</v>

1058
00:48:55.181 --> 00:49:00.181
<v Speaker 1>page and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it is filled with bones to bones of</v>

1059
00:49:01.481 --> 00:49:04.930
<v Speaker 1>these 30 people that live there were</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of this mob cause they're,</v>

1060
00:49:04.931 --> 00:49:08.320
<v Speaker 1>they live in these really small tribes</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they poisoned them.</v>

1061
00:49:08.590 --> 00:49:09.870
<v Speaker 1>So they brought them food and they put</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1062
00:49:09.871 --> 00:49:11.560
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we found like babies,</v>

1063
00:49:11.770 --> 00:49:15.610
<v Speaker 1>little tiny ribs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a little three inch long ribs from</v>

1064
00:49:15.611 --> 00:49:18.970
<v Speaker 1>a baby that got poisoned and he's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the entire tribe.</v>

1065
00:49:18.970 --> 00:49:22.720
<v Speaker 1>She's dead and their bones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is there just laying inside this</v>

1066
00:49:22.721 --> 00:49:25.570
<v Speaker 1>cave and he's got photographs with this</v>
<v Speaker 1>cave.</v>

1067
00:49:25.571 --> 00:49:27.490
<v Speaker 1>It's really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he'd go inside the caves,</v>

1068
00:49:27.491 --> 00:49:31.660
<v Speaker 1>all this weird art work of all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird animals,</v>

1069
00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:35.680
<v Speaker 1>including some animals that like doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>even exist anymore like dead</v>

1070
00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:40.330
<v Speaker 1>brontosaurus who's depicted on the wall</v>
<v Speaker 1>like with the long neck or [inaudible]</v>

1071
00:49:40.570 --> 00:49:43.570
<v Speaker 1>or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the idea that these people live</v>

1072
00:49:43.571 --> 00:49:46.990
<v Speaker 1>there for so long and had all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>different dialects,</v>

1073
00:49:46.991 --> 00:49:51.940
<v Speaker 1>they're like someone 20 miles away would</v>
<v Speaker 1>speak way different than people here and</v>

1074
00:49:51.970 --> 00:49:54.760
<v Speaker 1>none of it was written down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now their history was written down.</v>

1075
00:49:55.210 --> 00:49:58.780
<v Speaker 1>Like all of it was just like stories</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they told over the campfire or</v>

1076
00:49:58.781 --> 00:49:59.614
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

1077
00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:01.940
<v Speaker 7>I thought you were going to go into the</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1078
00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:03.690
<v Speaker 7>big foot Australia thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was in that.</v>

1079
00:50:03.691 --> 00:50:07.110
<v Speaker 7>Do they have it?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Did they talk about it there or if you</v>

1080
00:50:07.111 --> 00:50:09.240
<v Speaker 7>watched finding big foot,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they say they have one.</v>

1081
00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:10.920
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What did he do?</v>

1082
00:50:10.921 --> 00:50:11.670
<v Speaker 7>Get on?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

1083
00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:13.740
<v Speaker 7>get on a ship.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I grew up there.</v>

1084
00:50:13.950 --> 00:50:16.110
<v Speaker 7>He grew up in Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They have their own,</v>

1085
00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:18.460
<v Speaker 7>they have their own portals or</v>
<v Speaker 7>something.</v>

1086
00:50:18.980 --> 00:50:19.130
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1087
00:50:19.130 --> 00:50:20.570
<v Speaker 1>there's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an animal in,</v>

1088
00:50:20.571 --> 00:50:22.370
<v Speaker 1>I think it's Vietnam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They called the Orang.</v>

1089
00:50:22.371 --> 00:50:25.190
<v Speaker 1>Pendek.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what from Vietnam for</v>

1090
00:50:25.191 --> 00:50:28.190
<v Speaker 1>somewhere around maybe somewhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's an amnesia,</v>

1091
00:50:28.550 --> 00:50:30.620
<v Speaker 5>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Orang pendek was like a,</v>

1092
00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:33.980
<v Speaker 5>as like a small hairy monkey man that's</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1093
00:50:34.010 --> 00:50:35.930
<v Speaker 5>but I think it's a little,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's the only like four feet</v>

1094
00:50:35.931 --> 00:50:38.660
<v Speaker 5>tall or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they think that that thing,</v>

1095
00:50:39.860 --> 00:50:42.980
<v Speaker 5>at least the legend of that thing is</v>
<v Speaker 5>probably similar to that.</v>

1096
00:50:42.981 --> 00:50:43.880
<v Speaker 5>Hobbit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

1097
00:50:44.570 --> 00:50:48.690
<v Speaker 5>Homo flory is four.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He assists four yeses.</v>

1098
00:50:48.890 --> 00:50:50.720
<v Speaker 5>I think that's what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's it.</v>

1099
00:50:50.721 --> 00:50:53.390
<v Speaker 5>It's from the island of Flores.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They found these a hobbit.</v>

1100
00:50:53.391 --> 00:50:57.950
<v Speaker 5>People legitimately were a different</v>
<v Speaker 5>species of human,</v>

1101
00:50:58.370 --> 00:51:02.930
<v Speaker 5>like this really weird look in three</v>
<v Speaker 5>foot tall little hobbit person.</v>

1102
00:51:03.900 --> 00:51:05.190
<v Speaker 5>Creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

1103
00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:08.100
<v Speaker 5>And they existed fairly recently.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1104
00:51:08.101 --> 00:51:11.850
<v Speaker 5>I think they found bones that were as</v>
<v Speaker 5>recent as 14,000 years ago.</v>

1105
00:51:12.390 --> 00:51:13.530
<v Speaker 5>Geez.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1106
00:51:14.190 --> 00:51:16.170
<v Speaker 5>So 14,000 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a little hobbit.</v>

1107
00:51:16.171 --> 00:51:19.470
<v Speaker 5>People were running around.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not only that,</v>

1108
00:51:19.471 --> 00:51:22.230
<v Speaker 5>they think that they had like real</v>
<v Speaker 5>problems with people at the interact</v>

1109
00:51:22.231 --> 00:51:23.370
<v Speaker 5>with each other,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fight with each other,</v>

1110
00:51:23.610 --> 00:51:25.230
<v Speaker 5>maybe prayed on each other.</v>

1111
00:51:29.170 --> 00:51:31.120
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well not like hobbits or they liked the</v>

1112
00:51:31.170 --> 00:51:32.610
<v Speaker 7>hobbits,</v>
<v Speaker 7>hobbits,</v>

1113
00:51:32.611 --> 00:51:35.670
<v Speaker 7>Lord of the rings.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There were like three magical people or</v>

1114
00:51:35.671 --> 00:51:36.504
<v Speaker 7>something.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Kind of,</v>

1115
00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:37.210
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1116
00:51:37.210 --> 00:51:40.110
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that they were respected.</v>

1117
00:51:40.111 --> 00:51:40.980
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1118
00:51:40.981 --> 00:51:41.814
<v Speaker 5>they did.</v>

1119
00:51:41.910 --> 00:51:43.050
<v Speaker 7>Did some street cred.</v>

1120
00:51:47.290 --> 00:51:48.730
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean they were cool.</v>

1121
00:51:48.990 --> 00:51:50.630
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe they got fucked with because they</v>

1122
00:51:50.631 --> 00:51:53.050
<v Speaker 5>were a little right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's just trying to remember,</v>

1123
00:51:53.051 --> 00:51:53.884
<v Speaker 5>cause I feel ah,</v>

1124
00:51:54.060 --> 00:51:56.640
<v Speaker 7>they didn't wear shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Did that they were like hairy feet</v>

1125
00:51:56.670 --> 00:51:57.930
<v Speaker 7>number.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Big Hairy feet.</v>

1126
00:51:58.560 --> 00:51:59.610
<v Speaker 7>That's a little creepy.</v>

1127
00:52:00.590 --> 00:52:01.180
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1128
00:52:01.180 --> 00:52:02.330
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Potentially.</v>

1129
00:52:02.590 --> 00:52:04.510
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when Dominic Monaghan was on a podcast,</v>

1130
00:52:04.511 --> 00:52:06.490
<v Speaker 5>I literally almost forgot that he was a</v>
<v Speaker 5>hobbit.</v>

1131
00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:08.361
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cause I,</v>

1132
00:52:08.361 --> 00:52:10.570
<v Speaker 5>I thought of him as the guy from Los</v>
<v Speaker 5>Charlie.</v>

1133
00:52:10.770 --> 00:52:14.500
<v Speaker 5>Charlie from loss or drowned.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 5>So sad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1135
00:52:16.270 --> 00:52:17.103
<v Speaker 5>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Charlie,</v>

1136
00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:18.190
<v Speaker 5>he's back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's alive.</v>

1137
00:52:18.210 --> 00:52:19.180
<v Speaker 5>We were,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1138
00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:21.730
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's great.</v>

1139
00:52:22.430 --> 00:52:24.440
<v Speaker 7>So yes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I been getting more into these,</v>

1140
00:52:24.441 --> 00:52:28.010
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Pablo Escobar documentaries just live in</v>

1141
00:52:28.011 --> 00:52:30.080
<v Speaker 7>that kind of lifestyle,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know what I mean?</v>

1142
00:52:30.890 --> 00:52:33.140
<v Speaker 7>Just live in that life for him.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Smoking joints,</v>

1143
00:52:33.141 --> 00:52:36.140
<v Speaker 7>watch and Pablo Escobar,</v>
<v Speaker 7>smoking joints.</v>

1144
00:52:36.141 --> 00:52:39.200
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I liked what he wore were like grandpa</v>

1145
00:52:39.201 --> 00:52:40.610
<v Speaker 7>sweaters and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1146
00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:42.680
<v Speaker 7>he went to worst clothes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1147
00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:45.090
<v Speaker 7>He had like bad running shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Pretty sure the Cardigan.</v>

1148
00:52:45.170 --> 00:52:48.090
<v Speaker 7>I warned my special,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he's one at some point and</v>

1149
00:52:49.660 --> 00:52:52.910
<v Speaker 7>I was just hearing that some people</v>
<v Speaker 7>think that uh,</v>

1150
00:52:52.970 --> 00:52:57.970
<v Speaker 7>El Chapo might have more money and more,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1151
00:52:59.330 --> 00:53:03.350
<v Speaker 7>reach then Escobar did,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but not more power or at least not more</v>

1152
00:53:03.351 --> 00:53:05.510
<v Speaker 7>power within the countries.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

1153
00:53:05.670 --> 00:53:06.900
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>definitely not now.</v>

1154
00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:08.340
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's definitely different time period</v>

1155
00:53:08.341 --> 00:53:09.880
<v Speaker 5>too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he's fucked now.</v>

1156
00:53:10.530 --> 00:53:13.110
<v Speaker 5>He broke his leg trying to get away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jumped you there.</v>

1157
00:53:13.111 --> 00:53:15.840
<v Speaker 5>I think the reason it got brought up was</v>
<v Speaker 5>because this lawyer is currently</v>

1158
00:53:15.841 --> 00:53:19.680
<v Speaker 5>complaining that he's being tortured in</v>
<v Speaker 5>prison and how's it being tortured?</v>

1159
00:53:20.610 --> 00:53:22.410
<v Speaker 5>He was in prison for a long time before</v>
<v Speaker 5>though.</v>

1160
00:53:22.411 --> 00:53:24.150
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's in prison for a long time.</v>

1161
00:53:24.151 --> 00:53:26.430
<v Speaker 5>Then he escaped and then they got them</v>
<v Speaker 5>again.</v>

1162
00:53:26.431 --> 00:53:28.710
<v Speaker 5>They just keep again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>skip four times.</v>

1163
00:53:28.711 --> 00:53:31.650
<v Speaker 5>I think</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a freak.</v>

1164
00:53:32.730 --> 00:53:34.650
<v Speaker 5>He's a big time freak.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How crazy.</v>

1165
00:53:34.651 --> 00:53:36.300
<v Speaker 5>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sean Penn went to meet him.</v>

1166
00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:41.400
<v Speaker 5>I went to meet him and did an article</v>
<v Speaker 5>for rolling stone shaking his hand.</v>

1167
00:53:42.420 --> 00:53:43.890
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's unbelievable.</v>

1168
00:53:44.130 --> 00:53:46.590
<v Speaker 5>What was he thinking?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're a movie star,</v>

1169
00:53:46.591 --> 00:53:48.510
<v Speaker 5>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why do you want to go meet Pablo?</v>

1170
00:53:48.810 --> 00:53:50.970
<v Speaker 5>Not Pablo Escobar,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but El Chapo</v>

1171
00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:53.190
<v Speaker 4>didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did he give her and he,</v>

1172
00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:54.360
<v Speaker 4>and I'm giving them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're like,</v>

1173
00:53:54.660 --> 00:53:56.160
<v Speaker 4>did he have to tell someone where you</v>
<v Speaker 4>met him?</v>

1174
00:53:57.820 --> 00:54:00.560
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or don't know why he says word</v>

1175
00:54:00.690 --> 00:54:02.140
<v Speaker 4>journalistic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1176
00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:05.390
<v Speaker 4>like</v>
<v Speaker 4>freedom.</v>

1177
00:54:05.550 --> 00:54:07.770
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I do remember that there was a girl</v>

1178
00:54:08.190 --> 00:54:10.500
<v Speaker 5>that he knew there was an actress that</v>
<v Speaker 5>hooked it all up.</v>

1179
00:54:10.540 --> 00:54:12.480
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She banging them.</v>

1180
00:54:12.830 --> 00:54:14.630
<v Speaker 5>But that was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

1181
00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:16.300
<v Speaker 5>I hope so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

1182
00:54:16.650 --> 00:54:19.490
<v Speaker 5>that's what I like about narcos to</v>
<v Speaker 5>report a check.</v>

1183
00:54:19.491 --> 00:54:20.670
<v Speaker 5>Did he bang?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So every now and then,</v>

1184
00:54:22.090 --> 00:54:24.430
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>breaking news.</v>

1185
00:54:28.110 --> 00:54:33.110
<v Speaker 3>But that life's crazy to think about</v>
<v Speaker 3>that and they'll look at how they ran</v>

1186
00:54:33.371 --> 00:54:36.550
<v Speaker 3>that and just scaring people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And to be able to fight your own</v>

1187
00:54:36.551 --> 00:54:39.250
<v Speaker 3>government and lock yourself in and</v>
<v Speaker 3>escape.</v>

1188
00:54:39.251 --> 00:54:41.680
<v Speaker 3>And I'm the people for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but with you,</v>

1189
00:54:41.681 --> 00:54:42.050
<v Speaker 3>and it's</v>

1190
00:54:42.050 --> 00:54:44.210
<v Speaker 5>scary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But let's look at it this way.</v>

1191
00:54:44.330 --> 00:54:46.670
<v Speaker 5>Is it scary than the people that sell</v>
<v Speaker 5>oxycontin?</v>

1192
00:54:46.671 --> 00:54:49.470
<v Speaker 5>The kills thousands of people every year</v>
<v Speaker 5>and nobody does a thing about it.</v>

1193
00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:51.920
<v Speaker 5>They do a completely legal and</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody's paid off.</v>

1194
00:54:52.190 --> 00:54:55.700
<v Speaker 5>That might be scarier because yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't have to use violence and</v>

1195
00:54:55.701 --> 00:54:58.280
<v Speaker 5>shoot people in the street and threaten</v>
<v Speaker 5>people and scare people.</v>

1196
00:54:58.281 --> 00:55:03.281
<v Speaker 5>And people don't live under this blanket</v>
<v Speaker 5>of fear that they lived under during the</v>

1197
00:55:03.740 --> 00:55:06.890
<v Speaker 5>Pablo Escobar days.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But just many people are dying and just</v>

1198
00:55:06.891 --> 00:55:09.590
<v Speaker 5>as much money's being made,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe more people are dying.</v>

1199
00:55:10.820 --> 00:55:13.190
<v Speaker 3>You are right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I mean about the fear thing,</v>

1200
00:55:13.191 --> 00:55:16.940
<v Speaker 3>like granted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's tough to compare the two,</v>

1201
00:55:16.941 --> 00:55:21.350
<v Speaker 3>but if you compare all the people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>have been afraid of getting caught with</v>

1202
00:55:21.351 --> 00:55:23.390
<v Speaker 3>marijuana over the past,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1203
00:55:23.450 --> 00:55:27.440
<v Speaker 3>decades,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because that I feel like has mostly been</v>

1204
00:55:27.441 --> 00:55:32.441
<v Speaker 3>brought on or at least kept in place by</v>
<v Speaker 3>big medicine then and all of that stuff</v>

1205
00:55:34.041 --> 00:55:39.041
<v Speaker 3>that stemmed from marijuana and like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>selling marijuana and having a gun for</v>

1206
00:55:39.291 --> 00:55:41.540
<v Speaker 3>marijuana and this and that and all that</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

1207
00:55:41.541 --> 00:55:45.080
<v Speaker 3>Then you put all that together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a much bigger imprint than it</v>

1208
00:55:45.081 --> 00:55:46.040
<v Speaker 3>seems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1209
00:55:46.150 --> 00:55:47.400
<v Speaker 5>It's a big imprint,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but here's the,</v>

1210
00:55:47.610 --> 00:55:51.520
<v Speaker 5>the weirdest one now in 2016 for the</v>
<v Speaker 5>first time,</v>

1211
00:55:51.730 --> 00:55:56.730
<v Speaker 5>more people are using pain pills.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then tobacco in the United States,</v>

1212
00:55:57.220 --> 00:56:00.790
<v Speaker 5>including cigars,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Chu cigarettes,</v>

1213
00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:02.800
<v Speaker 5>the whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything.</v>

1214
00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:06.340
<v Speaker 5>More people using fucking prescription</v>
<v Speaker 5>pain pills.</v>

1215
00:56:06.460 --> 00:56:07.930
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then using tobacco,</v>

1216
00:56:07.990 --> 00:56:11.530
<v Speaker 5>which is nuts because you can go down</v>
<v Speaker 5>any street and see people smoking</v>

1217
00:56:11.531 --> 00:56:12.850
<v Speaker 5>cigarettes everywhere you go.</v>

1218
00:56:13.290 --> 00:56:14.111
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not too long.</v>

1219
00:56:14.111 --> 00:56:15.820
<v Speaker 4>Or You,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you'd tried to have me look up</v>

1220
00:56:15.850 --> 00:56:20.080
<v Speaker 4>how many prescriptions with like our out</v>
<v Speaker 4>for adderall and the u s and as I was</v>

1221
00:56:20.081 --> 00:56:22.480
<v Speaker 4>trying to look it up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that that's like public</v>

1222
00:56:22.481 --> 00:56:24.250
<v Speaker 4>info.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like wouldn't want that out there with</v>

1223
00:56:24.251 --> 00:56:26.920
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well sometimes that stuff gets out in</v>

1224
00:56:26.921 --> 00:56:28.510
<v Speaker 4>some sort of a way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1225
00:56:29.110 --> 00:56:31.330
<v Speaker 4>cause I could,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a hard time finding it.</v>

1226
00:56:31.331 --> 00:56:35.290
<v Speaker 4>I just had like rough guesstimations</v>
<v Speaker 4>different things.</v>

1227
00:56:35.291 --> 00:56:37.240
<v Speaker 4>It's always happening based off of</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

1228
00:56:37.241 --> 00:56:38.890
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we were like,</v>

1229
00:56:39.050 --> 00:56:42.310
<v Speaker 4>who lives in Florida?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could go get 10 oxicon things like</v>

1230
00:56:42.311 --> 00:56:45.670
<v Speaker 4>this and you just go over down to things</v>
<v Speaker 4>like those are being tracked.</v>

1231
00:56:47.390 --> 00:56:49.970
<v Speaker 5>Same any more.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They used to be like that,</v>

1232
00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:53.210
<v Speaker 5>but it's way different now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Back then when they were doing that,</v>

1233
00:56:53.211 --> 00:56:56.930
<v Speaker 5>the oxycontin express days,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was more people that were getting</v>

1234
00:56:57.320 --> 00:57:01.730
<v Speaker 5>oxycontin prescriptions in Florida than</v>
<v Speaker 5>the rest of the country combined.</v>

1235
00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:06.280
<v Speaker 5>Damn,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a Florida at Florida.</v>

1236
00:57:06.290 --> 00:57:11.290
<v Speaker 5>So crazy is the strongest painkiller</v>
<v Speaker 5>that just makes you basically my heroin.</v>

1237
00:57:12.830 --> 00:57:15.590
<v Speaker 5>It's not even the strongest painkiller,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the strongest painkillers.</v>

1238
00:57:15.591 --> 00:57:17.060
<v Speaker 5>That's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How do you say it?</v>

1239
00:57:17.061 --> 00:57:22.061
<v Speaker 5>Phenological fentanyl,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fentanyl and fentanyl is spending a shit</v>

1240
00:57:22.681 --> 00:57:26.510
<v Speaker 5>load of money to try to keep marijuana</v>
<v Speaker 5>illegal in Arizona.</v>

1241
00:57:26.750 --> 00:57:31.750
<v Speaker 5>They spent $500,000 to try to stop the</v>
<v Speaker 5>legalization of recreational marijuana</v>

1242
00:57:34.881 --> 00:57:35.810
<v Speaker 5>in Arizona</v>

1243
00:57:37.630 --> 00:57:40.320
<v Speaker 3>downstairs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that not a red flag then?</v>

1244
00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:42.250
<v Speaker 3>How are they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how can they do that</v>

1245
00:57:42.650 --> 00:57:45.500
<v Speaker 4>creational thing on the ballot for the</v>
<v Speaker 4>California?</v>

1246
00:57:45.830 --> 00:57:48.030
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember it being discussed for</v>

1247
00:57:48.031 --> 00:57:49.910
<v Speaker 4>English.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like it should be talked about a</v>

1248
00:57:49.911 --> 00:57:50.420
<v Speaker 4>lot.</v>

1249
00:57:50.420 --> 00:57:52.670
<v Speaker 5>It should be talked about a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1250
00:57:52.730 --> 00:57:56.150
<v Speaker 5>it's pretty much like established in</v>
<v Speaker 5>most people's eyes isn't just going to</v>

1251
00:57:56.151 --> 00:57:57.380
<v Speaker 5>pass.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1252
00:57:57.740 --> 00:58:00.320
<v Speaker 5>I mean once they see how much money</v>
<v Speaker 5>Colorado is raking in,</v>

1253
00:58:00.770 --> 00:58:02.420
<v Speaker 5>plus Jerry Brown's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>our governor,</v>

1254
00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:03.980
<v Speaker 5>that walking a hippie and a half</v>

1255
00:58:04.330 --> 00:58:06.120
<v Speaker 4>wanting to the front of the shell or the</v>
<v Speaker 4>money too.</v>

1256
00:58:06.121 --> 00:58:08.430
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw articles in bring up recently on a</v>

1257
00:58:08.431 --> 00:58:11.160
<v Speaker 4>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I forget how much they,</v>

1258
00:58:11.390 --> 00:58:13.770
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's as much as Colorado if not more.</v>

1259
00:58:13.771 --> 00:58:17.130
<v Speaker 4>And then I just saw some reason</v>
<v Speaker 4>Colorado's going $66 million,</v>

1260
00:58:17.131 --> 00:58:21.480
<v Speaker 4>they're going to go towards bully at</v>
<v Speaker 4>like advocacy or something like that.</v>

1261
00:58:21.481 --> 00:58:23.460
<v Speaker 4>Like they have that much of a surplus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How,</v>

1262
00:58:25.050 --> 00:58:27.630
<v Speaker 4>how do you stop bullying with money?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you do?</v>

1263
00:58:27.660 --> 00:58:29.190
<v Speaker 4>Programs and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

1264
00:58:29.191 --> 00:58:29.970
<v Speaker 4>I don't know that they will.</v>

1265
00:58:29.970 --> 00:58:31.200
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you do,</v>

1266
00:58:31.950 --> 00:58:35.250
<v Speaker 3>you give the bullies the money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how you do it.</v>

1267
00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:37.410
<v Speaker 3>You get the bullies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the money.</v>

1268
00:58:37.411 --> 00:58:40.280
<v Speaker 3>All of a sudden guess who's lunch money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not taken.</v>

1269
00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:42.720
<v Speaker 3>Do we be little sons?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How about that?</v>

1270
00:58:44.180 --> 00:58:45.980
<v Speaker 3>Let's solve the epidemic right word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1271
00:58:46.680 --> 00:58:49.350
<v Speaker 5>The real way to solve it would be to</v>
<v Speaker 5>teach them how to fight.</v>

1272
00:58:49.540 --> 00:58:51.080
<v Speaker 5>Teach a martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1273
00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:53.850
<v Speaker 5>They wouldn't be beaten each other up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They'd be competing,</v>

1274
00:58:54.330 --> 00:58:56.160
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or they look like pussies.</v>

1275
00:58:56.300 --> 00:58:59.090
<v Speaker 4>When I was in like middle school that</v>
<v Speaker 4>try this thing was migrated school cause</v>

1276
00:58:59.091 --> 00:59:02.810
<v Speaker 4>we were known as like the ghetto school</v>
<v Speaker 4>up to like six or seven little catholic</v>

1277
00:59:02.811 --> 00:59:05.030
<v Speaker 4>schools in our area because we had black</v>
<v Speaker 4>kids at our school.</v>

1278
00:59:05.470 --> 00:59:07.000
<v Speaker 4>And that's why you were known as the</v>
<v Speaker 4>ghetto school?</v>

1279
00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:07.873
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think so.</v>

1280
00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:09.650
<v Speaker 4>I mean what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we weren't in the ghetto or anything</v>

1281
00:59:09.651 --> 00:59:11.930
<v Speaker 4>like that and it was a private Catholic</v>
<v Speaker 4>school.</v>

1282
00:59:11.931 --> 00:59:14.050
<v Speaker 4>It's not like it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't a free public.</v>

1283
00:59:14.570 --> 00:59:16.700
<v Speaker 4>What was ghetto about it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't like it.</v>

1284
00:59:16.850 --> 00:59:18.760
<v Speaker 4>It riverbank.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Any black girls not.</v>

1285
00:59:18.761 --> 00:59:20.060
<v Speaker 4>And I was in middle school.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1286
00:59:20.260 --> 00:59:21.093
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but not anyway.</v>

1287
00:59:21.570 --> 00:59:22.340
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anyway,</v>

1288
00:59:22.340 --> 00:59:25.220
<v Speaker 4>so we have to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the dances we were delivering were like,</v>

1289
00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:29.710
<v Speaker 4>this is the 19 nine in mid 96,</v>
<v Speaker 4>96 we're like rap music was still like</v>

1290
00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:32.990
<v Speaker 4>gangster rap was getting big.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So some of all black kids liked it when</v>

1291
00:59:32.991 --> 00:59:36.860
<v Speaker 4>they put it on it or a dance then start</v>
<v Speaker 4>like we jump around and everyone get</v>

1292
00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:41.930
<v Speaker 4>little kids at a party raise 13 either</v>
<v Speaker 4>way all the parents or the kids at those</v>

1293
00:59:41.931 --> 00:59:43.670
<v Speaker 4>schools didn't like it.</v>

1294
00:59:43.970 --> 00:59:48.260
<v Speaker 4>So we got complained to or against and</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the next two years we had what they</v>

1295
00:59:48.261 --> 00:59:53.261
<v Speaker 4>called conflict resolution as an actual</v>
<v Speaker 4>class instead of like art for some,</v>

1296
00:59:53.511 --> 00:59:58.511
<v Speaker 4>for like a year where we had to like do</v>
<v Speaker 4>workshops and worksheets about how to be</v>

1297
01:00:00.111 --> 01:00:02.930
<v Speaker 4>acting with other kids in situations</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it was,</v>

1298
01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:06.890
<v Speaker 4>no one took it seriously at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But like they told us that's what it was</v>

1299
01:00:06.891 --> 01:00:10.310
<v Speaker 4>for us because we weren't acting like we</v>
<v Speaker 4>got banned from the dances at those</v>

1300
01:00:10.311 --> 01:00:12.350
<v Speaker 4>schools that we couldn't go there and</v>
<v Speaker 4>get to have our own.</v>

1301
01:00:13.010 --> 01:00:16.460
<v Speaker 4>Did you feel like a rebel?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No dumb.</v>

1302
01:00:16.461 --> 01:00:19.640
<v Speaker 4>We didn't understand why it was done</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they were being picked off.</v>

1303
01:00:20.030 --> 01:00:22.910
<v Speaker 4>What'd you guys literally it came from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember an incident where there was</v>

1304
01:00:22.911 --> 01:00:27.800
<v Speaker 4>like a song came on and a bunch of kids</v>
<v Speaker 4>from my school specifically gotten a a</v>

1305
01:00:27.801 --> 01:00:30.020
<v Speaker 4>circle and we're like jumping around</v>
<v Speaker 4>like put their hands up.</v>

1306
01:00:30.270 --> 01:00:32.570
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember the song.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been slammed by Onyx and through,</v>

<v Speaker 4>yeah it's so like all the white guy</v>
<v Speaker 4>went,</v>

1308
01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:38.510
<v Speaker 4>this is what I think happened and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 4>pretty sure it did.</v>

1309
01:00:38.511 --> 01:00:41.210
<v Speaker 4>Like all the white kids were like</v>
<v Speaker 4>freaking out like what the fuck's going</v>

1310
01:00:41.211 --> 01:00:44.690
<v Speaker 4>on and what has been the teachers that</v>
<v Speaker 4>were watching it over and won't like</v>

1311

<v Speaker 4>what are all these kids doing from the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that school ghetto school over there on</v>

1312
01:00:48.711 --> 01:00:51.530

<v Speaker 4>We can't be having that with our kids.</v>

1313
01:00:51.531 --> 01:00:54.750
<v Speaker 4>Fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they think they complained and then</v>

1314
01:00:56.370 --> 01:00:58.460
<v Speaker 4>two years later,</v>
<v Speaker 4>once all those troubled kids are up in</v>

1315
01:00:58.461 --> 01:01:00.650
<v Speaker 4>high school and there's some new kids in</v>
<v Speaker 4>an aren't act enough,</v>

<v Speaker 4>And then</v>

1317
01:01:02.930 --> 01:01:05.010
<v Speaker 1>I only went away and I got a dumb</v>
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>

<v Speaker 3>three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three or four summers ago in San Diego.</v>

1346
01:02:13.521 --> 01:02:14.570
<v Speaker 3>I remember.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's when,</v>

1347

<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kanye and Jay z got together and they</v>

1348
01:02:17.361 --> 01:02:21.780
<v Speaker 3>made an album and he made a song,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Edwards words in Paris and it's stole</v>

1349
01:02:21.781 --> 01:02:26.040
<v Speaker 3>this summer and it was just one of those</v>
<v Speaker 3>songs where you are hearing it all</v>

1350
01:02:26.041 --> 01:02:27.960
<v Speaker 3>summer and it had a big beat and</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

1351
01:02:27.961 --> 01:02:32.820
<v Speaker 3>We were in an outdoor bar in San Diego</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all of a sudden it came on and it</v>

1352
01:02:32.821 --> 01:02:35.730
<v Speaker 3>was like a hot Saturday night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>middle of the summer.</v>

1353
01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:39.240
<v Speaker 3>And all of a sudden it came,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they came around the corner like doing</v>

1354
01:02:39.241 --> 01:02:42.660
<v Speaker 3>like it was almost like you were in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>music video thriller and,</v>

1355
01:02:43.110 --> 01:02:47.460
<v Speaker 3>and I'm looking at them and then I take</v>
<v Speaker 3>a moment cause I'm sorta like creepily</v>

1356
01:02:47.461 --> 01:02:48.480
<v Speaker 3>aware,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

1357
01:02:48.481 --> 01:02:53.340
<v Speaker 3>To look around and see what the white</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are doing it this like outdoor</v>

1358
01:02:53.341 --> 01:02:57.390
<v Speaker 3>bar and everybody was just mesmerized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

1359
01:02:58.140 --> 01:03:01.800
<v Speaker 3>I dunno like Cirque de Solei except it</v>
<v Speaker 3>was just a bunch of cool black people</v>

1360
01:03:01.801 --> 01:03:03.840
<v Speaker 3>dancing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>walking down the street at the same time</v>

1361
01:03:03.870 --> 01:03:05.850
<v Speaker 3>in synchronization with each other.</v>

1362
01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:07.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So many videotapes,</v>

1363
01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:11.000
<v Speaker 1>some flash mob in the middle of New York</v>
<v Speaker 1>City on a day like,</v>

1364
01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:12.940
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had some thing where everybody</v>

1365
01:03:12.941 --> 01:03:15.420
<v Speaker 1>agreed to meet at a certain place at a</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain time.</v>

1366
01:03:15.450 --> 01:03:19.270
<v Speaker 1>Then when the clock strikes midnight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody fucking jumps in and gets</v>

1367
01:03:19.271 --> 01:03:22.090
<v Speaker 1>crazy and dances around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love shit like that.</v>

1368
01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:24.640

1369
01:03:24.641 --> 01:03:29.641
<v Speaker 1>company that's not like some marketing</v>
<v Speaker 1>campaign from some cell phone provider.</v>

1370
01:03:30.460 --> 01:03:34.480
<v Speaker 1>That's an organic thing that people just</v>
<v Speaker 1>decided to get crazy.</v>

1371
01:03:34.580 --> 01:03:36.980

<v Speaker 3>That's what makes it worse.</v>

1374
01:03:39.980 --> 01:03:41.090
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To kind of happen.</v>

1408
01:05:27.110 --> 01:05:31.720
<v Speaker 3>and squeezing so hard that for the first</v>
<v Speaker 3>time in my life I was like standing up</v>

1409
01:05:31.721 --> 01:05:34.150
<v Speaker 3>while driving like I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

1410
01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:39.280
<v Speaker 3>I was up on my left foot because it felt</v>
<v Speaker 3>like my butt cheeks could get tighter if</v>

1411
01:05:39.281 --> 01:05:43.570
<v Speaker 3>I like was in a standing position rather</v>
<v Speaker 3>than setting and I mean I'm doing</v>

1412
01:05:43.571 --> 01:05:45.940
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm literally praying to God for the</v>

1413
01:05:45.941 --> 01:05:50.230
<v Speaker 3>first time in like five or six years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean like I'm literally like whatever.</v>

1414
01:05:50.231 --> 01:05:52.600
<v Speaker 3>If anything is controlling any of the</v>

<v Speaker 3>they were also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was wearing these like gray shorts.</v>

1418
01:06:04.550 --> 01:06:08.420
<v Speaker 3>They're like cloth shorts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it would have been so terrible,</v>

1419
01:06:08.421 --> 01:06:10.430
<v Speaker 3>so terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

1420
01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:13.030
<v Speaker 7>what the fuck were we just talking?</v>

<v Speaker 7>about not having clothes on.</v>

1422

<v Speaker 7>that's crazy being naked.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 7>of all people.</v>

<v Speaker 7>here's where it gets really interesting.</v>

1435

1437
01:07:05.350 --> 01:07:09.490
<v Speaker 7>It happened to people before it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>especially if you were in view of a</v>

1438
01:07:09.491 --> 01:07:10.260
<v Speaker 7>school,</v>

<v Speaker 3>working because like,</v>

1443

<v Speaker 3>you know how every once in awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how close you've been to shitting your</v>

1444
01:07:30.151 --> 01:07:33.450
<v Speaker 3>pants lately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like it bubbles up and you're like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>let them,</v>

01:07:38.190 --> 01:07:40.110
<v Speaker 3>let them go for a little bit and it'll</v>
<v Speaker 3>just be,</v>

1450
01:07:40.111 --> 01:07:42.150
<v Speaker 3>everything will be okay for like two</v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes.</v>

1451
01:07:42.510 --> 01:07:43.450
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did it pass?</v>

1452
01:07:43.451 --> 01:07:45.270
<v Speaker 3>It's like a hurricane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like when you hear people</v>

1453
01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:47.760
<v Speaker 3>describing hurricanes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought the eye,</v>

1454
01:07:47.761 --> 01:07:52.761
<v Speaker 3>the eye of the storm Rd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then two minutes later it Garner and</v>

1455
01:07:54.390 --> 01:07:57.540
<v Speaker 3>I ended up making it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what's crazy that I do remember</v>

1456
01:07:57.541 --> 01:08:02.160
<v Speaker 3>about this and I made it to the first</v>
<v Speaker 3>gas station that was 41 miles.</v>

1457
01:08:02.161 --> 01:08:03.630
<v Speaker 3>I mean I was just sweating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

1458
01:08:03.660 --> 01:08:07.740
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how to describe it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like 40 miles quenching emergency</v>

1459
01:08:07.741 --> 01:08:10.080
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You bought off the chair the whole time.</v>

1460
01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:13.060
<v Speaker 3>My left leg was sore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my whole alignment is off.</v>

1461
01:08:15.860 --> 01:08:20.860
<v Speaker 3>I get adjusted to go to a reiki master.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what's crazy is that because like</v>

1462
01:08:22.220 --> 01:08:26.810
<v Speaker 3>there's actually another piece to this</v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing puzzle is that after you've been</v>

1463
01:08:26.811 --> 01:08:31.811
<v Speaker 3>holding it for 41 miles or whatever and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know even do all this shit and once</v>

1464
01:08:32.661 --> 01:08:37.550
<v Speaker 3>you make it to the closest restroom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that first gas station off that first</v>

1465
01:08:37.551 --> 01:08:40.370
<v Speaker 3>exit and you go to the men's room and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in,</v>

1466
01:08:40.371 --> 01:08:41.990
<v Speaker 3>there's only one stall there.</v>

1467
01:08:42.930 --> 01:08:43.450
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1468
01:08:43.450 --> 01:08:45.820
<v Speaker 3>That is the stall of</v>

1469
01:08:46.390 --> 01:08:49.930
<v Speaker 3>demolition my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean once I was in and I was,</v>

1470
01:08:49.931 --> 01:08:53.560
<v Speaker 3>I mean you just notice there's graffiti</v>
<v Speaker 3>everywhere.</v>

1471
01:08:53.561 --> 01:08:56.560
<v Speaker 3>There's toilet paper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every everything you've ever seen is</v>

1472
01:08:56.590 --> 01:09:01.440
<v Speaker 3>everywhere because that is the stall of</v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody who's almost shit there.</v>

1473
01:09:01.630 --> 01:09:05.620
<v Speaker 3>Every man coming southbound from</v>
<v Speaker 3>northern California that had to shit in</v>

1474
01:09:05.621 --> 01:09:10.621
<v Speaker 3>this 40 miles span class through that</v>
<v Speaker 3>door and the glass through that stall</v>

1475
01:09:11.681 --> 01:09:16.681
<v Speaker 3>door and just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it is the stall.</v>

1476
01:09:16.901 --> 01:09:20.170
<v Speaker 3>So that's what's crazy is that like yeah</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a few other gas stations on</v>

1477
01:09:20.171 --> 01:09:22.850
<v Speaker 3>that exit but I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember literally being like,</v>

1478
01:09:22.990 --> 01:09:25.300
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I was in that final red light.</v>

1479
01:09:25.301 --> 01:09:27.340
<v Speaker 3>Cause you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once you see it's a weird thing your</v>

1480
01:09:27.341 --> 01:09:28.600
<v Speaker 3>body does too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is,</v>

1481
01:09:28.601 --> 01:09:31.180
<v Speaker 3>once you see the gas station,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see the restroom,</v>

1482
01:09:31.181 --> 01:09:33.160
<v Speaker 3>that's when it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1483
01:09:33.180 --> 01:09:36.120
<v Speaker 3>it's like real people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

1484
01:09:36.130 --> 01:09:39.970
<v Speaker 3>a fixed set of faces but just like can't</v>
<v Speaker 3>take it anymore.</v>

1485
01:09:39.971 --> 01:09:41.170
<v Speaker 3>It's like there it is.</v>

1486
01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:45.230
<v Speaker 5>It is really fucking bizarre that you</v>
<v Speaker 5>are not allowed to be naked.</v>

1487
01:09:45.380 --> 01:09:48.980
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like that your body comes like out of</v>

1488
01:09:48.981 --> 01:09:53.870
<v Speaker 5>the box with no clothes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We require you to purchase clothes or</v>

1489
01:09:53.871 --> 01:09:55.910
<v Speaker 5>make them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean if you,</v>

1490
01:09:56.030 --> 01:09:58.340
<v Speaker 5>I guess you could have a bunch of leaves</v>
<v Speaker 5>glued together.</v>

1491
01:09:58.341 --> 01:10:01.310
<v Speaker 5>No one could stop you as long as no one</v>
<v Speaker 5>can see your genitals.</v>

1492
01:10:01.910 --> 01:10:05.360
<v Speaker 5>And then even then we have like rules</v>
<v Speaker 5>for that.</v>

1493
01:10:05.750 --> 01:10:10.750
<v Speaker 5>Like a girl can wear a thong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So literally she can have a string that</v>

1494
01:10:11.511 --> 01:10:16.511
<v Speaker 5>goes over her asshole and then just a</v>
<v Speaker 5>little Dorito that covers her clit and</v>

1495
01:10:18.321 --> 01:10:20.360
<v Speaker 5>we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're good.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Brown nipple skin.</v>

1499
01:10:28.221 --> 01:10:30.800
<v Speaker 5>You dirty bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you'd see all the,</v>

1500
01:10:30.801 --> 01:10:34.880
<v Speaker 5>the voluptuousness of the outside.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's very weird.</v>

1501
01:10:34.881 --> 01:10:38.090
<v Speaker 5>We're real weird with clothes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is like you could have like beaches</v>

1502
01:10:38.091 --> 01:10:40.430
<v Speaker 5>where people get nude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you have to have an agreement.</v>

1503
01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:42.590
<v Speaker 5>Like this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is the beach where everybody's</v>

1504
01:10:42.591 --> 01:10:45.830
<v Speaker 5>allowed to not wear clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but for the most part you have to wear</v>

1505
01:10:45.831 --> 01:10:46.664
<v Speaker 5>clothes.</v>

1506
01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:48.593
<v Speaker 6>That's</v>

1507
01:10:49.140 --> 01:10:52.580
<v Speaker 4>it was interested to hear for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're moving a camera,</v>

1508
01:10:52.581 --> 01:10:54.920
<v Speaker 4>taking a picture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like eight guys in running a camera or</v>

1509
01:10:55.130 --> 01:10:58.250
<v Speaker 4>canoeing down the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They stopped and it was like drinking a</v>

1510
01:10:58.251 --> 01:11:00.350
<v Speaker 4>beer and everything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everyone took a picture and I was like,</v>

1511
01:11:00.351 --> 01:11:02.240
<v Speaker 4>let's get the fuck outta here.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I kept the bike hit a bottle of Jack</v>

1544
01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:09.951
<v Speaker 4>Daniels in any,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I was like,</v>

1545
01:12:09.951 --> 01:12:11.400
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what we're going to remember,</v>

<v Speaker 4>we'll let you guys go but get the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 4>like get the fuck out of here.</v>

1547
01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:16.710
<v Speaker 4>Nothing ended up happening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But enemy,</v>

1548
01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:18.450
<v Speaker 4>he also meant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he said they're like,</v>

1549
01:12:18.451 --> 01:12:21.930
<v Speaker 4>it's okay for all you girls to take</v>
<v Speaker 4>pictures with your tops off</v>

1550
01:12:22.700 --> 01:12:23.533
<v Speaker 6>but</v>

1551
01:12:23.540 --> 01:12:25.340
<v Speaker 4>no asses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's illegal.</v>

1552
01:12:26.140 --> 01:12:28.180
<v Speaker 6>We're all like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Huh.</v>

1553
01:12:28.350 --> 01:12:32.700
<v Speaker 4>And like I guess from then I've always</v>
<v Speaker 4>like thought or that's I think when I</v>

1554
01:12:32.701 --> 01:12:35.430
<v Speaker 4>learned that like girls are allowed to</v>
<v Speaker 4>walk around with their tops off.</v>

1555
01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:38.220
<v Speaker 4>Honestly I think it's some states that</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're in Ohio now.</v>

1556
01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:40.230
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then the different New York you can</v>

1557
01:12:40.231 --> 01:12:42.660
<v Speaker 5>do it right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was like a thing that they fought</v>

1558
01:12:42.661 --> 01:12:45.840
<v Speaker 5>for it because men can walk around with</v>
<v Speaker 5>no shirts on in New York.</v>

1559
01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:47.850
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>up until like the beginning of the,</v>

1560
01:12:47.910 --> 01:12:51.840
<v Speaker 5>to the turn of the 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was illegal for men to walk around</v>

1561
01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:54.480
<v Speaker 5>bare shirt and it was like a big Oh</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

1562
01:12:54.481 --> 01:12:57.390
<v Speaker 5>There's like a big movement where I</v>
<v Speaker 5>think,</v>

1563
01:12:57.391 --> 01:13:00.180
<v Speaker 5>I want to say like the early 1,980,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the teens,</v>

1564
01:13:00.660 --> 01:13:02.760
<v Speaker 5>they uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they duked it out.</v>

1565
01:13:02.820 --> 01:13:04.020
<v Speaker 5>Like they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1566
01:13:04.021 --> 01:13:07.140
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they fought to have decency thing too.</v>

1567
01:13:07.380 --> 01:13:09.860
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean men fought to,</v>

1568
01:13:09.980 --> 01:13:13.620
<v Speaker 5>to have the right to walk around</v>
<v Speaker 5>shirtless cause fucking hot out</v>

1569
01:13:13.621 --> 01:13:17.010
<v Speaker 5>sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but women couldn't for like a long time,</v>

1570
01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:22.320
<v Speaker 5>I want to say until fairly recently.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And apps obviously like,</v>

1571
01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:25.950
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I understand that a woman's breasts is</v>

1572
01:13:25.951 --> 01:13:28.230
<v Speaker 5>more titillating,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no pun intended.</v>

1573
01:13:28.770 --> 01:13:31.080
<v Speaker 5>But you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't say like,</v>

1574
01:13:31.081 --> 01:13:33.840
<v Speaker 5>men can walk around with their dicks</v>
<v Speaker 5>hanging out,</v>

1575
01:13:33.841 --> 01:13:36.030
<v Speaker 5>but when we can't show their vaginas,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's just crazy.</v>

1576
01:13:36.330 --> 01:13:37.200
<v Speaker 5>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Besides that,</v>

1577
01:13:37.201 --> 01:13:40.350
<v Speaker 5>are there nipples have to be covered in</v>
<v Speaker 5>our nimbleness or just like,</v>

1578
01:13:40.351 --> 01:13:44.410
<v Speaker 5>who's looking fuck monitor useless slam</v>
<v Speaker 5>my nipple and a fucking bag fault.</v>

1579
01:13:44.430 --> 01:13:45.263
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't feel it.</v>

1580
01:13:47.810 --> 01:13:48.960
<v Speaker 5>It's different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Numb.</v>

1581
01:13:48.961 --> 01:13:51.120
<v Speaker 5>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they literally don't feel like anything.</v>

1582
01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:53.640
<v Speaker 5>They don't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had a girl suck on him once.</v>

1583
01:13:53.641 --> 01:13:54.720
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could just stop.</v>

1584
01:13:57.640 --> 01:14:00.820
<v Speaker 5>Why don't you just suck on my elbow?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the same thing.</v>

1585
01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:03.430
<v Speaker 5>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So my elbow might be more sensitive.</v>

1586
01:14:04.050 --> 01:14:06.370
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's so true.</v>

1587
01:14:06.430 --> 01:14:09.590
<v Speaker 5>It's weird because women's nipples get</v>
<v Speaker 5>erect.</v>

1588
01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:12.100
<v Speaker 5>They get excited,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they perk up,</v>

1589
01:14:12.170 --> 01:14:15.040
<v Speaker 7>no milk shoots out sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1590
01:14:15.100 --> 01:14:16.720
<v Speaker 7>excited.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Whoa.</v>

1591
01:14:18.230 --> 01:14:19.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they really,</v>

1592
01:14:19.100 --> 01:14:22.220
<v Speaker 3>they really like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that for a long time I always</v>

1593
01:14:22.221 --> 01:14:26.540
<v Speaker 3>thought that a boobs for girls were the</v>
<v Speaker 3>same like for guys.</v>

1594
01:14:26.541 --> 01:14:29.900
<v Speaker 3>And it was like not that much feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I sort of like always ignored them.</v>

1595
01:14:31.220 --> 01:14:33.260
<v Speaker 3>This vagina thing is the most important</v>

1596
01:14:34.250 --> 01:14:36.160
<v Speaker 7>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>man,</v>

1597
01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:39.230
<v Speaker 7>I learned a little bit later on that</v>
<v Speaker 7>like girls like that their boots are</v>

1598
01:14:39.231 --> 01:14:41.280
<v Speaker 7>different than our boobs.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1599
01:14:41.300 --> 01:14:42.920
<v Speaker 7>Like last week,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a couple of weeks ago.</v>

1600
01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:46.940
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's interesting.</v>

1601
01:14:47.150 --> 01:14:51.050
<v Speaker 7>It's interesting that the differences,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what we're allowed to get away with,</v>

1602
01:14:51.051 --> 01:14:53.210
<v Speaker 7>what we're not allowed to get away with.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

1603
01:14:54.260 --> 01:14:56.720
<v Speaker 7>like imagine it men wore skirts to</v>
<v Speaker 7>meetings.</v>

1604
01:14:57.350 --> 01:15:01.340
<v Speaker 7>If Mandy can have like little skirts,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no killed.</v>

1605
01:15:01.910 --> 01:15:02.840
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Kind of do.</v>

1606
01:15:02.900 --> 01:15:06.110
<v Speaker 7>But that's like this does,</v>
<v Speaker 7>does a dress I think goes down your</v>

1607
01:15:06.111 --> 01:15:07.820
<v Speaker 7>knees.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1608
01:15:07.821 --> 01:15:10.560
<v Speaker 7>And it's got like a big belt buckle and</v>
<v Speaker 7>stuff to make it cool.</v>

1609
01:15:10.590 --> 01:15:13.960
<v Speaker 7>I think thinking of pilgrims</v>
<v Speaker 7>sometimes they,</v>

1610
01:15:13.961 --> 01:15:17.240
<v Speaker 7>I got a little Satchel thing,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's like a fanny pack.</v>

1611
01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:19.150
<v Speaker 3>You mean like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry but it had,</v>

1612
01:15:19.151 --> 01:15:22.840
<v Speaker 3>I pooped off that side of that road and</v>

<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1672
01:18:24.620 --> 01:18:29.390
<v Speaker 5>Gut Flora is one of the most important</v>
<v Speaker 5>aspects of health that is only really</v>

1673
01:18:29.391 --> 01:18:31.670
<v Speaker 5>being understood over the last few</v>
<v Speaker 5>decades.</v>

1674
01:18:32.060 --> 01:18:35.950
<v Speaker 5>People really didn't know that the</v>
<v Speaker 5>bacteria inside your gut has not,</v>

1675
01:18:36.110 --> 01:18:38.390
<v Speaker 5>not only does it just affect your</v>
<v Speaker 5>stomach,</v>

1676
01:18:38.690 --> 01:18:42.190
<v Speaker 5>but it affects your personalities.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are Neurons in the guide or some affects</v>

1677
01:18:42.191 --> 01:18:43.460
<v Speaker 5>your mood?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1678
01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:45.690
<v Speaker 5>not that it's just the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a,</v>

1679
01:18:45.750 --> 01:18:49.550
<v Speaker 5>some sort of a symbiotic relationship</v>
<v Speaker 5>that we have with our gut flora.</v>

1680
01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:53.060
<v Speaker 5>And when your flora is bad,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it has all sorts of negative</v>

1681
01:18:53.061 --> 01:18:54.770
<v Speaker 5>consequences on your immune system.</v>

1682
01:18:55.550 --> 01:18:59.990
<v Speaker 5>I'm big enough probiotics.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Over the last few years I've been eating</v>

1683
01:18:59.991 --> 01:19:02.270
<v Speaker 5>a lot of Kimchi.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I drink,</v>

1684
01:19:02.271 --> 01:19:04.160
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is that stuff called?</v>

1685
01:19:04.161 --> 01:19:06.260
<v Speaker 5>Dot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Keifer is a Kefir or Keith,</v>

1686
01:19:06.261 --> 01:19:07.470
<v Speaker 5>I think a key for it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't know.</v>

1687
01:19:07.910 --> 01:19:09.320
<v Speaker 5>I never really say it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And read it.</v>

1688
01:19:09.690 --> 01:19:11.090
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Kombucha,</v>

1689
01:19:11.630 --> 01:19:13.970
<v Speaker 5>lots of different probiotics.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I take those on it.</v>

1690
01:19:13.971 --> 01:19:16.580
<v Speaker 5>Total gut health packets.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If I've got a stack with me,</v>

1691
01:19:16.581 --> 01:19:19.670
<v Speaker 5>I travel on the road with it and don't</v>
<v Speaker 5>go on it anyway without it.</v>

1692
01:19:19.671 --> 01:19:22.100
<v Speaker 5>But acid awfulness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like all that kind of stuff,</v>

1693
01:19:22.101 --> 01:19:26.690
<v Speaker 5>like having a healthy gut flora and it</v>
<v Speaker 5>makes a giant difference on whether you</v>

1694
01:19:26.691 --> 01:19:30.470
<v Speaker 5>get sick,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how long your sickness and lasts you</v>

1695
01:19:30.471 --> 01:19:33.470
<v Speaker 5>can't his or can you take too much of</v>
<v Speaker 5>that where your body just get rid of it?</v>

1696
01:19:33.471 --> 01:19:37.100
<v Speaker 5>If it doesn't want it to be a question,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would imagine.</v>

1697
01:19:37.130 --> 01:19:38.150
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's healthy.</v>

1698
01:19:38.180 --> 01:19:40.220
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it's like,</v>

1699
01:19:40.221 --> 01:19:43.490
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like certain vitamins are fat soluble</v>

1700
01:19:43.491 --> 01:19:46.310
<v Speaker 5>and if you take too many of them in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it could fuck with you and you really</v>

1701
01:19:46.311 --> 01:19:47.480
<v Speaker 5>want to make sure we get the right</v>
<v Speaker 5>amount.</v>

1702
01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:49.790
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that's the same with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1703
01:19:49.850 --> 01:19:53.720
<v Speaker 5>with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with healthy bacteria it's really,</v>

1704
01:19:53.721 --> 01:19:57.080
<v Speaker 5>it's like almost like troops.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you're bringing in healthy troops</v>

1705
01:19:57.081 --> 01:19:59.360
<v Speaker 5>to fight off bad,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bad bacteria,</v>

1706
01:19:59.780 --> 01:20:02.630
<v Speaker 5>like for people to do Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anybody who's listening to this and does</v>

1707
01:20:02.631 --> 01:20:05.060
<v Speaker 5>Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 5>super important that you take</v>

1708
01:20:05.150 --> 01:20:06.740
<v Speaker 5>probiotics.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's very,</v>

1709
01:20:06.741 --> 01:20:11.050
<v Speaker 5>very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and never wash yourself with antibiotic</v>

1710
01:20:11.051 --> 01:20:13.920
<v Speaker 5>soap ever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cause when you wash yourself with</v>

1711
01:20:13.930 --> 01:20:17.040
<v Speaker 5>antibiotics,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it'd be stripped your body of all gut</v>

1712
01:20:17.041 --> 01:20:21.240
<v Speaker 5>flora or of all skin flora of the good</v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff to you.</v>

1713
01:20:21.241 --> 01:20:26.040
<v Speaker 5>What you want to do is use something</v>
<v Speaker 5>like defense soap that has healthy oils</v>

1714
01:20:26.190 --> 01:20:30.630
<v Speaker 5>that only promotes healthy flora and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it doesn't kill the,</v>

1715
01:20:30.631 --> 01:20:31.710
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the good stuff.</v>

1716
01:20:31.740 --> 01:20:36.740
<v Speaker 5>It promotes healthy flora and protects</v>
<v Speaker 5>you from the bad shit from getting like</v>

1717
01:20:37.831 --> 01:20:38.664
<v Speaker 5>ring Marlin's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1718
01:20:38.670 --> 01:20:43.230
<v Speaker 5>but it's not an antibiotic bacteria.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So like antibacteria so I had a friend</v>

1719
01:20:43.231 --> 01:20:45.930
<v Speaker 5>of mine who was a Jujitsu guy who had a</v>
<v Speaker 5>ringworm.</v>

1720
01:20:45.931 --> 01:20:50.520
<v Speaker 5>He started washing themselves with</v>
<v Speaker 5>antibacterial soap and he got fucking</v>

1721
01:20:50.540 --> 01:20:53.730
<v Speaker 5>ringworm everywhere because his body</v>
<v Speaker 5>couldn't fight it off</v>

1722
01:20:54.040 --> 01:20:57.700
<v Speaker 4>legal now or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or it's antibacterial is something or a</v>

1723
01:20:57.701 --> 01:20:59.640
<v Speaker 4>certain kinds of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a certain camouflaged most of</v>

1724
01:20:59.650 --> 01:21:02.230
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well we don't have jamie to check facts</v>

<v Speaker 7>around questions,</v>

1727
01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:07.360
<v Speaker 7>start thinking about things that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I remember,</v>

1728
01:21:10.100 --> 01:21:12.200
<v Speaker 7>Jay,</v>

1730
01:21:14.541 --> 01:21:16.460
<v Speaker 7>screen.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But now Jamie's like throwing the</v>

1731
01:21:16.550 --> 01:21:17.310
<v Speaker 7>question.</v>

1732
01:21:17.310 --> 01:21:18.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1733
01:21:18.831 --> 01:21:19.640
<v Speaker 3>FDA</v>

<v Speaker 4>antibacterial soaps.</v>

1736
01:21:24.261 --> 01:21:29.261
<v Speaker 4>Bands try glisten and 18 other chemicals</v>
<v Speaker 4>from soaps to track.</v>

1737
01:21:29.331 --> 01:21:33.690
<v Speaker 4>Listen is something that it was found in</v>
<v Speaker 4>lots of things like from toothpaste to</v>

1738
01:21:33.691 --> 01:21:35.540
<v Speaker 4>have antibacterial soap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess it's no,</v>

1739
01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:36.433
<v Speaker 4>it's no Bueno.</v>

1740
01:21:37.110 --> 01:21:40.440
<v Speaker 5>What's the deal with fluoride?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what's the real deal with fluoride?</v>

1741
01:21:40.620 --> 01:21:45.600
<v Speaker 5>Because fluoride is fucking poison.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I've heard people say that fluoride</v>

1742
01:21:45.601 --> 01:21:50.601
<v Speaker 5>is good for like for uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for healthy teeth and prevent tooth</v>

1743
01:21:51.511 --> 01:21:53.100
<v Speaker 5>decay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then I've heard that's total</v>

1744
01:21:53.101 --> 01:21:55.110
<v Speaker 5>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the only thing that's helping your</v>

1745
01:21:55.111 --> 01:21:57.450
<v Speaker 5>tooth decay is that you're not broken.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1746
01:21:57.451 --> 01:21:59.610
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're cleaning your teeth and that's</v>

1747
01:21:59.611 --> 01:22:01.620
<v Speaker 5>what's healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's not the fluoride,</v>

1748
01:22:02.310 --> 01:22:03.920
<v Speaker 4>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They put it in the water supply and</v>

1749
01:22:03.921 --> 01:22:05.150
<v Speaker 4>people thought that that's poisoning.</v>

1750
01:22:05.270 --> 01:22:07.100
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's where people think that it's like</v>

1751
01:22:07.101 --> 01:22:12.101
<v Speaker 5>designed to make you stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is a shitty new search to know</v>

1752
01:22:12.801 --> 01:22:13.560
<v Speaker 5>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1753
01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:17.030
<v Speaker 5>This is a terrible fucking research</v>
<v Speaker 5>podcast.</v>

1754
01:22:17.031 --> 01:22:19.700
<v Speaker 5>This one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're upset at this.</v>

1755
01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:20.960
<v Speaker 5>You should be a very rough</v>

1756
01:22:22.540 --> 01:22:25.120
<v Speaker 7>fucking guys.</v>
<v Speaker 7>All they have is questions.</v>

1757
01:22:25.420 --> 01:22:26.400
<v Speaker 7>No accident.</v>

1758
01:22:28.990 --> 01:22:32.350
<v Speaker 3>We're going to have a companion podcast</v>
<v Speaker 3>to this where we actually check</v>

<v Speaker 3>everything</v>

1760
01:22:34.580 --> 01:22:38.350
<v Speaker 7>then as usual.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's kind of funny though that</v>

1761
01:22:38.500 --> 01:22:43.500
<v Speaker 5>we do have this whole ecosystem thing</v>
<v Speaker 5>going on in our body that it's not just</v>

1762
01:22:43.780 --> 01:22:47.440
<v Speaker 5>your body.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to prep your body from invading</v>

1763
01:22:47.441 --> 01:22:48.730
<v Speaker 5>bacteria.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1764
01:22:48.731 --> 01:22:52.030
<v Speaker 5>your body is filled with bacteria.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like the whole thing's bacteria.</v>

1765
01:22:52.540 --> 01:22:54.610
<v Speaker 5>It's like you're like a little planet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1766
01:22:54.850 --> 01:22:55.683
<v Speaker 5>It's weird.</v>

1767
01:22:57.500 --> 01:22:58.760
<v Speaker 3>We were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we made,</v>

1768
01:22:58.761 --> 01:23:02.750
<v Speaker 3>we were made from like calm being in</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a hot vagina.</v>

1769
01:23:02.990 --> 01:23:06.370
<v Speaker 5>Even crazy math were made from stars</v>
<v Speaker 5>exploding first.</v>

1770
01:23:07.100 --> 01:23:07.530
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1771
01:23:07.530 --> 01:23:12.380
<v Speaker 5>It had a star had explode in order to</v>
<v Speaker 5>create the very building blocks for</v>

1772
01:23:12.381 --> 01:23:14.780
<v Speaker 5>life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What in the fuck</v>

<v Speaker 3>It rotates either in July or August or</v>

1784
01:23:42.941 --> 01:23:45.280
<v Speaker 3>September.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot depends on the super moon.</v>

1785
01:23:45.850 --> 01:23:47.380
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he only does it during the supermarket.</v>

1786
01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:48.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The weekend of the Super Moon.</v>

1787
01:23:49.050 --> 01:23:51.610
<v Speaker 3>Like the week of we can go outside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1788
01:23:52.690 --> 01:23:53.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mm.</v>

1789
01:23:53.830 --> 01:23:57.490
<v Speaker 3>Bright Moon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was interesting.</v>

1790
01:23:57.491 --> 01:24:00.860
<v Speaker 3>This one was a different one because</v>
<v Speaker 3>this wasn't officially stream fast.</v>

1791
01:24:00.861 --> 01:24:04.210
<v Speaker 3>We just went cause we all missed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I missed shroom fast,</v>

1792
01:24:04.211 --> 01:24:05.680
<v Speaker 3>which was a couple of months ago or</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

1793
01:24:06.250 --> 01:24:09.880
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this one didn't have the moon out</v>

1794
01:24:09.940 --> 01:24:13.030
<v Speaker 3>right away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was actually my first time in four</v>

1795
01:24:13.031 --> 01:24:17.290
<v Speaker 3>or five years without the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Crazy as that is.</v>

1796
01:24:18.490 --> 01:24:21.730
<v Speaker 3>But it was there in a few hours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it wasn't there the first few hours</v>

1797
01:24:21.731 --> 01:24:24.850
<v Speaker 3>in the stars out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's just no way to describe</v>

1798
01:24:24.851 --> 01:24:27.650
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just fucking everywhere you</v>

1799
01:24:27.651 --> 01:24:30.200
<v Speaker 3>would do when you can't look at a</v>
<v Speaker 3>specific place and not see it.</v>

1800
01:24:30.230 --> 01:24:34.120
<v Speaker 3>A huge column for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you can't look at the sky for 30</v>

1801
01:24:34.121 --> 01:24:37.960
<v Speaker 3>seconds to two minutes in a row without</v>
<v Speaker 3>seeing another shooting star.</v>

1802
01:24:37.990 --> 01:24:39.790
<v Speaker 3>It's impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1803
01:24:39.850 --> 01:24:42.100
<v Speaker 3>If you're not seeing one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you're looking down.</v>

1804
01:24:42.610 --> 01:24:45.820
<v Speaker 5>Isn't that crazy that those are rocks</v>
<v Speaker 5>from space?</v>

1805
01:24:46.330 --> 01:24:48.340
<v Speaker 5>It probably came from millions of miles.</v>

1806
01:24:49.590 --> 01:24:50.490
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was out there.</v>

1807
01:24:50.491 --> 01:24:52.800
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking about how that was the</v>
<v Speaker 3>natural,</v>

1808
01:24:52.801 --> 01:24:55.680
<v Speaker 3>how that had to be like the first form</v>
<v Speaker 3>of entertainment.</v>

1809
01:24:55.820 --> 01:24:58.480
<v Speaker 3>Like what else would you watch?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1810
01:24:58.590 --> 01:25:01.830
<v Speaker 3>there was no falling asleep to Netflix.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

1811
01:25:01.950 --> 01:25:05.820
<v Speaker 3>I saw the stars last night and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was it.</v>

1812
01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:09.480
<v Speaker 5>And you hear a twig snap behind you that</v>
<v Speaker 5>was entertaining.</v>

1813
01:25:14.710 --> 01:25:16.440
<v Speaker 5>You're out there wandering around on</v>
<v Speaker 5>mushrooms.</v>

1814
01:25:16.441 --> 01:25:18.210
<v Speaker 5>You worry about spiders or anything like</v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

1815
01:25:19.270 --> 01:25:20.103
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1816
01:25:22.180 --> 01:25:24.070
<v Speaker 3>I was afraid of a little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we had a little,</v>

1817
01:25:24.071 --> 01:25:27.790
<v Speaker 3>a little mouse that kept running around</v>
<v Speaker 3>our campsite that at one point I was</v>

1818
01:25:27.791 --> 01:25:32.791
<v Speaker 3>like way too afraid of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was it a mouse or the tiniest little</v>

1819
01:25:33.781 --> 01:25:35.380
<v Speaker 3>mouse?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Little Cutie mouth.</v>

1820
01:25:35.490 --> 01:25:36.620
<v Speaker 3>It was freaking me out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1821
01:25:36.630 --> 01:25:38.700
<v Speaker 3>it was freaking me out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just getting too close.</v>

1822
01:25:38.701 --> 01:25:40.860
<v Speaker 3>It seemed like it was on mushrooms with</v>
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>

1823
01:25:40.861 --> 01:25:42.300
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get Outta here dude.</v>

1824
01:25:42.430 --> 01:25:44.020
<v Speaker 5>Maybe like new.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You guys were vulnerable.</v>

1825
01:25:44.770 --> 01:25:46.330
<v Speaker 5>It felt like it did close it on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1826
01:25:46.820 --> 01:25:49.210
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Animals definitely know the difference</v>

1827
01:25:49.211 --> 01:25:53.560
<v Speaker 5>between dark and day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it really bold at night as</v>

1828
01:25:53.561 --> 01:25:56.590
<v Speaker 5>opposed to during the day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>During the day they keep the fuck away</v>

1829
01:25:56.591 --> 01:25:59.740
<v Speaker 5>from me and be like deer at night.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're not nearly as worried about</v>

1830
01:25:59.741 --> 01:26:02.340
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's like almost like they know all</v>

1831
01:26:02.350 --> 01:26:04.010
<v Speaker 5>these fuckheads.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They can't see that good</v>

1832
01:26:05.540 --> 01:26:07.910
<v Speaker 5>like look bears.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really disturbing.</v>

1833
01:26:08.540 --> 01:26:10.640
<v Speaker 5>Like bears at nighttime they didn't do</v>
<v Speaker 5>very,</v>

1834
01:26:11.180 --> 01:26:14.600
<v Speaker 5>very like confident.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're not nervous about people at all.</v>

1835
01:26:14.601 --> 01:26:17.360
<v Speaker 5>If you ever around bears at night,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as it starts getting dark,</v>

1836
01:26:17.361 --> 01:26:19.700
<v Speaker 5>they start closing in on you and looking</v>
<v Speaker 5>at you differently.</v>

1837
01:26:19.810 --> 01:26:21.490
<v Speaker 3>Did bears have good nighttime vision?</v>

1838
01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:23.520
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of them were very nocturnal.</v>

1839
01:26:24.030 --> 01:26:25.660
<v Speaker 5>All animals are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1840
01:26:25.740 --> 01:26:28.160
<v Speaker 5>you mean almost all animals can see way</v>
<v Speaker 5>better</v>

1841
01:26:28.210 --> 01:26:29.530
<v Speaker 3>and then we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have nothing.</v>

1842

<v Speaker 5>Bugs,</v>

1854
01:27:06.061 --> 01:27:08.700
<v Speaker 5>snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All those things out in Joshua tree are</v>

1855
01:27:08.701 --> 01:27:10.710
<v Speaker 5>fucking creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Coyotes.</v>

1856
01:27:10.970 --> 01:27:14.390
<v Speaker 3>I told her I haven't seen any of those</v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

1857
01:27:14.391 --> 01:27:19.310
<v Speaker 3>We've heard coyotes out there and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's creepy when that happens,</v>

1858
01:27:19.820 --> 01:27:22.460
<v Speaker 3>but you know they're like in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>distance.</v>

1859
01:27:22.461 --> 01:27:24.140
<v Speaker 3>You just here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>

1860
01:27:24.490 --> 01:27:25.520
<v Speaker 3>that's cool though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1861
01:27:25.521 --> 01:27:26.540
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Super Cool.</v>

1862
01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:29.570
<v Speaker 3>It adds a real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you're almost like,</v>

1863
01:27:29.571 --> 01:27:31.700
<v Speaker 3>was that a human being fucking with us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

1864
01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:35.140
<v Speaker 5>do you know coyotes or wolves?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

1865
01:27:35.260 --> 01:27:37.990
<v Speaker 5>They're wolves are small wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hmm.</v>

1866
01:27:38.270 --> 01:27:41.800
<v Speaker 5>They're all in the same family.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's how they make those coy</v>

1867
01:27:41.801 --> 01:27:43.450
<v Speaker 5>wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They interbreed with each other back and</v>

1868
01:27:43.451 --> 01:27:45.110
<v Speaker 5>forth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're there.</v>

1869
01:27:45.130 --> 01:27:47.710
<v Speaker 5>They make viable offspring to there now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't make like,</v>

1870
01:27:48.070 --> 01:27:52.090
<v Speaker 5>like some animals make a hybrid and the</v>
<v Speaker 5>hybrid can't give birth or can't get</v>

1871
01:27:52.091 --> 01:27:54.160
<v Speaker 5>pregnant or can't make another animal</v>
<v Speaker 5>pregnant.</v>

1872
01:27:54.550 --> 01:27:57.760
<v Speaker 5>Not coyotes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Coyotes can fuck dogs too.</v>

1873
01:27:58.240 --> 01:27:59.350
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So can walls,</v>

1874
01:27:59.351 --> 01:28:01.690
<v Speaker 5>will can fuck dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really interesting.</v>

1875
01:28:02.380 --> 01:28:04.900
<v Speaker 5>But what a coyote is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is like when they first,</v>

1876
01:28:05.460 --> 01:28:08.090
<v Speaker 5>when they first discovered coyotes and</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1877
01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:10.600
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the settlers arrived,</v>

1878
01:28:10.870 --> 01:28:14.620
<v Speaker 5>they called them prairie wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was the first name for them before</v>

1879
01:28:14.621 --> 01:28:17.460
<v Speaker 5>they call them coyotes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Variables.</v>

1880
01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:20.070
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a lot kit or anything coyote.</v>

1881
01:28:20.730 --> 01:28:24.970
<v Speaker 5>It's a lot more memorable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then the aztecs called them Kaiyote</v>

1882
01:28:25.450 --> 01:28:30.450
<v Speaker 5>and then the Spanish called them Coyote</v>
<v Speaker 5>Otay and then that like there was a</v>

1883
01:28:32.561 --> 01:28:36.940
<v Speaker 5>Spanish pronunciation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Aztec name for coyotes prairie dog</v>

1884
01:28:36.941 --> 01:28:38.170
<v Speaker 5>and go for it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And same thing.</v>

1885
01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:40.930
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

1886
01:28:40.931 --> 01:28:45.931
<v Speaker 5>A prairie dog is different that I could</v>
<v Speaker 5>go for a golfer.</v>

1887
01:28:46.841 --> 01:28:47.740
<v Speaker 5>It's different</v>

1888
01:28:47.910 --> 01:28:52.910
<v Speaker 3>prairie dogs at groundhog and Zoetis who</v>
<v Speaker 3>has those stupid</v>

1889
01:28:55.150 --> 01:28:57.000
<v Speaker 3>questions over overs are smaller</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably,</v>

1890
01:28:57.001 --> 01:28:57.450
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1895
01:29:04.441 --> 01:29:06.540
<v Speaker 5>dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a little fuckers poked out through</v>

<v Speaker 5>my lawn.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like weird.</v>

1897
01:29:08.311 --> 01:29:09.810

<v Speaker 5>dirt,</v>

1898
01:29:09.811 --> 01:29:11.650
<v Speaker 5>but it's really just a gopher pop</v>

1902
01:29:22.441 --> 01:29:25.320
<v Speaker 5>then cal step and then they snapped</v>
<v Speaker 5>their legs and it becomes a real</v>

1903
01:29:25.321 --> 01:29:28.320
<v Speaker 5>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they shoot him like crazy and so</v>

1929
01:30:50.440 --> 01:30:54.120
<v Speaker 7>what's interesting is I was in her dog</v>
<v Speaker 7>and I was trying to figure out how to</v>

1930
01:30:54.121 --> 01:30:56.710
<v Speaker 7>work prairie dog and then it would take</v>
<v Speaker 7>somebody out and try to find somewhere</v>

1931
01:30:56.711 --> 01:30:57.480
<v Speaker 7>for them to shut up a</v>

1932
01:30:57.480 --> 01:30:58.900
<v Speaker 5>public.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That'd be your show.</v>

<v Speaker 5>That's what I call prairie dog.</v>

1935
01:31:04.620 --> 01:31:07.240
<v Speaker 5>There was a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's an animal called a ground</v>

1936
01:31:07.241 --> 01:31:08.680
<v Speaker 5>squirrel.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was very different than a tree.</v>

1937
01:31:08.681 --> 01:31:10.470
<v Speaker 5>Squirrel and ground squirrels.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You,</v>

1938
01:31:10.471 --> 01:31:13.300

<v Speaker 5>Tree squirrels apparently are very good.</v>

1939
01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:14.800
<v Speaker 5>They taste good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've actually eating them.</v>

1940
01:31:14.870 --> 01:31:17.410
<v Speaker 5>I shouldn't say apparently of actually</v>
<v Speaker 5>eating them.</v>

1941
01:31:17.440 --> 01:31:19.720
<v Speaker 5>They taste good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a weird little animal.</v>

1942
01:31:19.721 --> 01:31:20.990
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1943

1947
01:31:37.690 --> 01:31:42.690
<v Speaker 5>Turkey.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There is more biomass in prairie dogs</v>

1948
01:31:42.850 --> 01:31:46.630
<v Speaker 5>that all those other animals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's so many fun,</v>

1949
01:31:46.660 --> 01:31:48.410
<v Speaker 5>not prairie dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ground squirrels,</v>

1950
01:31:48.610 --> 01:31:51.670
<v Speaker 5>there's more so many fucking ground</v>
<v Speaker 5>squirrels.</v>

1951
01:31:51.910 --> 01:31:53.560
<v Speaker 5>So like when the guy was telling me</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

1952
01:31:53.561 --> 01:31:54.394
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

1953
01:31:54.490 --> 01:31:55.570
<v Speaker 5>are you serious?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>

1954
01:31:55.840 --> 01:31:59.050
<v Speaker 5>if you weighed all of the ground</v>
<v Speaker 5>squirrels on his,</v>

1955
01:31:59.590 --> 01:32:00.130
<v Speaker 5>he would weigh</v>

1956
01:32:00.130 --> 01:32:04.390
<v Speaker 1>as much as everything else combined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how is that possible?</v>

1957
01:32:04.440 --> 01:32:06.340
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then we're driving down the road,</v>

1958
01:32:06.341 --> 01:32:08.050
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just pay attention and watch 'em off.</v>

1959
01:32:08.110 --> 01:32:09.940
<v Speaker 1>And so as we're driving down the road</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you see them,</v>

1960
01:32:09.941 --> 01:32:13.130
<v Speaker 1>like as they hear the car coming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've jumped out of their holes and</v>

1961
01:32:13.131 --> 01:32:16.000
<v Speaker 1>scatter and run to another whole jump</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the whole scatter.</v>

1962
01:32:16.090 --> 01:32:18.250
<v Speaker 1>And you're seeing them all over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>

1963
01:32:18.430 --> 01:32:19.480
<v Speaker 1>like 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30,</v>

1964
01:32:19.481 --> 01:32:21.910
<v Speaker 1>40 in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your immediate vision,</v>

1965
01:32:22.330 --> 01:32:25.180
<v Speaker 1>just popping out of holes are running.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's dig a little holes in the</v>

1966
01:32:25.181 --> 01:32:26.220
<v Speaker 1>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dive into them.</v>

1967
01:32:27.410 --> 01:32:28.243

1969
01:32:29.811 --> 01:32:32.570
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you only see them for like a half a</v>

1970
01:32:32.571 --> 01:32:34.850
<v Speaker 1>second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you barely can get a shot off a</v>

<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 5>but they have a very strict anti</v>

2037
01:35:37.971 --> 01:35:42.110
<v Speaker 5>immigration policy like illegal</v>
<v Speaker 5>immigrants do not get treated with any</v>

2038
01:35:42.111 --> 01:35:43.330
<v Speaker 5>respect.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like what?</v>

2039
01:35:43.331 --> 01:35:47.450
<v Speaker 5>What trump was talking about pales in</v>
<v Speaker 5>comparison to what they do on a daily</v>

2040
01:35:47.451 --> 01:35:52.070
<v Speaker 5>basis in Australia and Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which seems to be like a place that's</v>

2041
01:35:52.071 --> 01:35:54.440
<v Speaker 5>really killing it right now and doing</v>
<v Speaker 5>really good.</v>

2042
01:35:54.470 --> 01:35:56.990
<v Speaker 5>They're doing really well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There are economies super strong.</v>

2043
01:35:57.020 --> 01:36:00.020
<v Speaker 5>There's only 20 million of them in a</v>
<v Speaker 5>country the size of the United States.</v>

2044
01:36:01.140 --> 01:36:02.040
<v Speaker 7>How many were you up here?</v>

2045
01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:05.000
<v Speaker 5>We have 30 million in California.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2046
01:36:05.060 --> 01:36:10.060
<v Speaker 5>we have 330 million in the country,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so we have 310 million more people than</v>

2047
01:36:11.241 --> 01:36:14.870
<v Speaker 5>they have in the same size.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Kind of like half as many people.</v>

2048
01:36:14.871 --> 01:36:17.720
<v Speaker 5>I'll show you just in Ohio,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then it put it in perspective.</v>

2049
01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:21.620
<v Speaker 5>I think we need a new car selves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's my,</v>

2050
01:36:21.621 --> 01:36:22.820
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I put it in perspective.</v>

2051
01:36:22.850 --> 01:36:26.780
<v Speaker 5>India.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think India is a third the size of the</v>

2052
01:36:26.781 --> 01:36:27.614
<v Speaker 5>United States.</v>

2053
01:36:28.290 --> 01:36:30.760
<v Speaker 7>It's got like a billion people one</v>
<v Speaker 7>point.</v>

2054
01:36:30.890 --> 01:36:33.830
<v Speaker 7>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Is that how small it is?</v>

2055
01:36:33.831 --> 01:36:35.480
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they make it so when you look at a map,</v>

2056
01:36:35.481 --> 01:36:37.850
<v Speaker 7>they make a lot of kids.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But it's another thing on that too.</v>

2057
01:36:37.851 --> 01:36:40.040
<v Speaker 7>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 7>More questions for us.</v>

2058
01:36:40.130 --> 01:36:44.720
<v Speaker 7>The Brazil is a gauge drawn the size of</v>
<v Speaker 7>Brazil's Rome on a map.</v>

2059
01:36:44.950 --> 01:36:46.610
<v Speaker 7>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's way bigger than [inaudible]</v>

2060
01:36:46.940 --> 01:36:48.980
<v Speaker 5>perceived like Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

2061
01:36:48.981 --> 01:36:51.290
<v Speaker 5>Afternoon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wade bowling perceived Brazil itself is</v>

2062
01:36:51.291 --> 01:36:53.030
<v Speaker 5>also way bigger than it looks like on</v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

2063
01:36:53.300 --> 01:36:57.480
<v Speaker 5>How big is India and compares?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do you guess?</v>

2064
01:36:57.481 --> 01:37:00.510
<v Speaker 5>I'm guessing the third.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd say slight.</v>

2065
01:37:00.660 --> 01:37:04.110
<v Speaker 5>No bigger than like Texas plus a couple</v>
<v Speaker 5>of surrounding states.</v>

2066
01:37:04.290 --> 01:37:06.370
<v Speaker 5>So that's close to 30.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

2067
01:37:06.700 --> 01:37:09.850
<v Speaker 7>I think it's like half his big.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't think it is.</v>

2068
01:37:10.700 --> 01:37:11.890
<v Speaker 7>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Let's see.</v>

2069
01:37:11.980 --> 01:37:14.620
<v Speaker 7>How big is India?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Any comparison?</v>

2070
01:37:19.570 --> 01:37:21.610
<v Speaker 7>Why don't you guys talk while,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2071
01:37:21.611 --> 01:37:24.270
<v Speaker 7>Indians have a lot of kids,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2087
01:38:10.620 --> 01:38:15.620
<v Speaker 5>think about Australia is three times</v>
<v Speaker 5>larger than India and India has a funk</v>

2088
01:38:18.030 --> 01:38:21.500
<v Speaker 5>and million people in it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those are perceived.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I'm pretty straight.</v>

2090
01:38:24.541 --> 01:38:27.720
<v Speaker 5>You can go anywhere and pour it on your</v>
<v Speaker 5>pants and take an emergency shit.</v>

2099
01:38:46.831 --> 01:38:49.890

<v Speaker 5>When you see African comparison to the</v>

2100
01:38:49.891 --> 01:38:51.210
<v Speaker 5>United States,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

2102
01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.700
<v Speaker 5>You could fit America,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fit China,</v>

2103
01:38:56.760 --> 01:38:59.220
<v Speaker 5>you fit Asia,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could fit Europe.</v>

2104
01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:02.400
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean Africa is fucking big man.</v>

2105

<v Speaker 5>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whoa.</v>

2106
01:39:06.120 --> 01:39:07.860
<v Speaker 5>Exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2107
01:39:08.310 --> 01:39:11.910
<v Speaker 5>It's bigger and blacker and everything</v>
<v Speaker 5>started there.</v>

2108
01:39:11.940 --> 01:39:14.000
<v Speaker 5>That's what's bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's all from there.</v>

2109
01:39:14.140 --> 01:39:15.360
<v Speaker 5>Chris Rock special,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2110
01:39:15.660 --> 01:39:18.270
<v Speaker 5>Bigger and blacker.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Best word.</v>

2111
01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:19.610
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was a no,</v>

2112
01:39:19.650 --> 01:39:22.410
<v Speaker 5>I'm not thinking bigger and blacker.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm thinking the one he went to Africa</v>

2113
01:39:22.770 --> 01:39:26.310
<v Speaker 5>and did stand up when you had that one</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that one whack me out.</v>

2114
01:39:26.380 --> 01:39:30.870
<v Speaker 5>Skip changing clothes like I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 5>understand why that was a good idea.</v>

2115
01:39:30.871 --> 01:39:34.170
<v Speaker 5>I like this definitely cutting edge at</v>
<v Speaker 5>the time,</v>

2116
01:39:34.171 --> 01:39:35.880
<v Speaker 5>but I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No benefited.</v>

2117
01:39:35.910 --> 01:39:38.160
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just think it was just a bunch of</v>

2118
01:39:38.161 --> 01:39:39.690
<v Speaker 5>shows put together,</v>
<v Speaker 5>showing off.</v>

2119
01:39:40.110 --> 01:39:42.870
<v Speaker 5>You're in a bunch of different places,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it also it,</v>

2120
01:39:43.710 --> 01:39:45.240
<v Speaker 5>it releases the veil.</v>

2121
01:39:45.270 --> 01:39:47.510
<v Speaker 5>It pulls aside the veil or the same</v>
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>

2122
01:39:47.700 --> 01:39:52.470
<v Speaker 5>The same set up punchline every night.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like that's like the hidden sort of</v>

2123
01:39:52.471 --> 01:39:55.110
<v Speaker 5>subtext to it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're letting everyone know like this</v>

2124
01:39:55.111 --> 01:39:56.730
<v Speaker 5>is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he does it the exact same way.</v>

2125
01:39:56.731 --> 01:40:00.330
<v Speaker 5>It sort of exposes a little bit of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>magic of what he's doing.</v>

2126
01:40:00.630 --> 01:40:01.680
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>great comic.</v>

2127
01:40:01.681 --> 01:40:06.681
<v Speaker 5>Like Chris Rock is so smooth on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You get caught up in this,</v>

2128
01:40:07.561 --> 01:40:10.950
<v Speaker 5>like you don't thinking that this is a</v>
<v Speaker 5>well prepared,</v>

2129
01:40:10.951 --> 01:40:12.930
<v Speaker 5>well-written,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well-rehearsed bit.</v>

2130
01:40:13.140 --> 01:40:17.010
<v Speaker 5>You're just laughing at the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But when you see him perform the set up</v>

2131
01:40:17.011 --> 01:40:18.130
<v Speaker 5>in one place,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the punchline,</v>

2132
01:40:18.150 --> 01:40:20.490
<v Speaker 5>the other,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then you're forced to sort of</v>

2133
01:40:20.491 --> 01:40:21.540
<v Speaker 5>internalize like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2134
01:40:21.541 --> 01:40:24.900
<v Speaker 5>he does this the exact same way</v>
<v Speaker 5>everywhere he goes.</v>

2135
01:40:24.901 --> 01:40:28.320
<v Speaker 5>He said it a hundred times four.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's almost like seeing it twice in some</v>

2136
01:40:28.321 --> 01:40:29.370
<v Speaker 5>sort of a way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We,</v>

2137
01:40:29.371 --> 01:40:33.030
<v Speaker 5>you see someone who's really funny and</v>
<v Speaker 5>then you see them again do the same bit.</v>

2138
01:40:33.030 --> 01:40:36.150
<v Speaker 5>It's not as good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like even if you really love them,</v>

2139
01:40:36.300 --> 01:40:39.000
<v Speaker 5>it's a little less good,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

2140
01:40:39.001 --> 01:40:42.620
<v Speaker 5>And so he kind of had that in a special</v>
<v Speaker 5>kind of built in.</v>

2141
01:40:42.990 --> 01:40:45.000
<v Speaker 5>It's still great,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2142
01:40:45.001 --> 01:40:48.840
<v Speaker 5>but not in my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not as good.</v>

2143
01:40:49.640 --> 01:40:52.800
<v Speaker 5>But that's one of those things where you</v>
<v Speaker 5>just keep trying to do something weird.</v>

2144
01:40:53.320 --> 01:40:54.190
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2145
01:40:54.580 --> 01:40:59.170
<v Speaker 5>keep trying to mix it up like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like if you did your whole special like</v>

2146
01:40:59.230 --> 01:41:01.960
<v Speaker 5>from the beginning to the end with one</v>
<v Speaker 5>camera,</v>

2147
01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:04.470
<v Speaker 5>like you showed up and found the whole</v>
<v Speaker 5>thing is just kind of</v>

2148
01:41:04.730 --> 01:41:08.030
<v Speaker 3>genius idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One shot on Netflix,</v>

2149
01:41:08.210 --> 01:41:12.200
<v Speaker 3>Tony Hinchcliffe go see it now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you doing another one in October and</v>

2150
01:41:12.201 --> 01:41:13.880
<v Speaker 3>he decided I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2151
01:41:13.890 --> 01:41:15.670
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you want to do what your next one?</v>

2152
01:41:15.870 --> 01:41:18.170
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to wait to see when somebody</v>

2153
01:41:18.171 --> 01:41:22.200
<v Speaker 3>comes at me with an idea or something</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that and I dunno.</v>

2154
01:41:22.280 --> 01:41:23.450
<v Speaker 3>We'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then again,</v>

2155
01:41:23.451 --> 01:41:26.660
<v Speaker 3>if nobody comes at me soon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe I'll just make another one at some</v>

2156
01:41:26.661 --> 01:41:29.330
<v Speaker 3>point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You made yours and then you sold it to</v>

2157
01:41:29.331 --> 01:41:30.011
<v Speaker 3>Netflix,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

2158
01:41:30.011 --> 01:41:32.870
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like what I did with the Ice</v>

2159
01:41:32.870 --> 01:41:34.910
<v Speaker 3>House,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can pretty much pitch that to anybody</v>

2160
01:41:34.911 --> 01:41:36.410
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they'd be down,</v>

2161
01:41:37.070 --> 01:41:40.040
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a pretty cool deal so,</v>

2162
01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:42.740
<v Speaker 5>well it's also shawn,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this was the way you did it.</v>

2163
01:41:42.741 --> 01:41:46.310
<v Speaker 5>It's like you really get the sense of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the intimacy of a comedy club,</v>

2164
01:41:46.311 --> 01:41:50.900
<v Speaker 5>which I think still is the best venue</v>
<v Speaker 5>for a special,</v>

2165
01:41:50.930 --> 01:41:52.040
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cause you're like,</v>

2166
01:41:52.490 --> 01:41:53.300
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're in,</v>

2167
01:41:53.300 --> 01:41:55.550
<v Speaker 5>in your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where you're watching television at</v>

2168
01:41:55.551 --> 01:41:56.810
<v Speaker 5>home,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're in your living room,</v>

2169
01:41:57.270 --> 01:41:59.270
<v Speaker 5>you're sitting on a couch just like that</v>
<v Speaker 5>usually.</v>

2170
01:41:59.540 --> 01:42:02.390
<v Speaker 5>So like stand up should be in a small</v>
<v Speaker 5>room,</v>

2171
01:42:02.690 --> 01:42:03.460
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2172
01:42:03.460 --> 01:42:04.293
<v Speaker 5>The club,</v>

2173
01:42:04.360 --> 01:42:05.570
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so cool.</v>

2174
01:42:05.571 --> 01:42:07.430
<v Speaker 3>When I did the Ice House with you last</v>
<v Speaker 3>week,</v>

2175
01:42:07.820 --> 01:42:10.840
<v Speaker 3>Sean Sullivan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the GM there came up to me and uh,</v>

2176
01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:13.400
<v Speaker 3>we were talking a little bit about it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he goes,</v>

2177
01:42:13.401 --> 01:42:15.800
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's people that come to this spot</v>

2178
01:42:15.801 --> 01:42:17.930
<v Speaker 3>right next to the parking spot here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they even,</v>

2179
01:42:17.990 --> 01:42:19.850
<v Speaker 3>they checked with the employees and us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they got,</v>

2180
01:42:19.940 --> 01:42:23.330
<v Speaker 3>isn't that the spot where Tony starts</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then he goes in and then he comes</v>

2181
01:42:23.331 --> 01:42:24.400
<v Speaker 3>back there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2182
01:42:24.470 --> 01:42:27.380
<v Speaker 3>So it's sort of like his like opened up</v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

2183
01:42:27.381 --> 01:42:28.041
<v Speaker 3>sir.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2184
01:42:28.041 --> 01:42:29.840
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a cool spot.</v>

2185
01:42:29.841 --> 01:42:32.750
<v Speaker 3>Like I guess like when you see that</v>
<v Speaker 3>bullet hole in the back of the belly</v>

2186
01:42:32.751 --> 01:42:34.380
<v Speaker 3>room sign,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like kinnisons thing.</v>

2187
01:42:34.420 --> 01:42:36.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's like a little bit of a</v>

2188
01:42:36.770 --> 01:42:38.660
<v Speaker 3>language.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They never fixed that sign.</v>

2189
01:42:39.560 --> 01:42:41.570
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're trying to fix too many things.</v>

2190
01:42:41.571 --> 01:42:45.530
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to fix the patio floor</v>
<v Speaker 3>now and just see that debacle.</v>

2191
01:42:45.531 --> 01:42:47.210
<v Speaker 3>But next,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not shiny now.</v>

2192
01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:48.860
<v Speaker 3>It was shining.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was cool.</v>

2193
01:42:48.870 --> 01:42:49.790
<v Speaker 3>Was about to slip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2194
01:42:49.791 --> 01:42:51.710
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they sanded it down.</v>

2195
01:42:51.920 --> 01:42:53.510
<v Speaker 3>It looks like it's bad.</v>

2196
01:42:53.620 --> 01:42:56.610
<v Speaker 5>Why would they fix the bullet hole?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Sam Kennison putting that sign.</v>

2197
01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.360
<v Speaker 5>That's like history.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have to keep that sign.</v>

2198
01:42:59.520 --> 01:43:02.810
<v Speaker 5>It makes half to one the one that they</v>
<v Speaker 5>fix the hole.</v>

2199
01:43:03.560 --> 01:43:04.170
<v Speaker 5>The hole.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2200
01:43:04.170 --> 01:43:05.190
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I hope so.</v>

2201
01:43:06.420 --> 01:43:09.510
<v Speaker 5>I hope they had to throw it out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It makes zero sense to fix that.</v>

2202
01:43:09.810 --> 01:43:11.370
<v Speaker 5>It still has the bullet hole in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>back.</v>

2203
01:43:12.210 --> 01:43:13.043
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>

2204
01:43:13.190 --> 01:43:16.370
<v Speaker 5>just doesn't have it through the glass.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The plastic part was lit up.</v>

2205
01:43:16.730 --> 01:43:18.620
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know that was a thing.</v>

2206
01:43:18.800 --> 01:43:21.500
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he shot right to the fucking thing.</v>

2207
01:43:21.560 --> 01:43:23.380
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What a crazy little cane.</v>

2208
01:43:23.381 --> 01:43:26.330
<v Speaker 5>Steph an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is there a good question back by the</v>

2209
01:43:26.331 --> 01:43:27.610
<v Speaker 5>size?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Someone pointed it out there again.</v>

2210
01:43:27.620 --> 01:43:29.240
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know there was one year or two</v>

2211
01:43:30.110 --> 01:43:33.770
<v Speaker 5>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean if he shot a 38 at close range is</v>

2212
01:43:33.771 --> 01:43:35.210
<v Speaker 5>I believe that's what everybody said it</v>
<v Speaker 5>was.</v>

2213
01:43:35.550 --> 01:43:37.640
<v Speaker 5>Who would definitely go through that and</v>
<v Speaker 5>into the wall.</v>

2214
01:43:39.940 --> 01:43:44.500
<v Speaker 5>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the photo for the cover of one shot shot</v>

2215
01:43:44.501 --> 01:43:45.130

<v Speaker 3>Jamie Vernon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vernon.</v>

2217
01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:50.350
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2218
01:43:50.610 --> 01:43:52.580
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Steve was there literally</v>

2219
01:43:52.580 --> 01:43:55.130
<v Speaker 7>in there and then he literally wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 7>after that.</v>

2220
01:43:56.600 --> 01:44:01.600
<v Speaker 7>It's just a complete technical layer</v>
<v Speaker 7>from the person who was on my first non</v>

2221
01:44:02.211 --> 01:44:03.640
<v Speaker 7>credit.</v>
