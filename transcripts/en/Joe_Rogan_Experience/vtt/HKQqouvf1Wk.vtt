<v Speaker 1>research and investigation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Speaking in your body.</v>

5
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:10.553
<v Speaker 1>I poke and did you see that picture of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Travis Brown's finger knuckle deep into </v>

6
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.340
<v Speaker 1>from silver dooms eyeball?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't even say anything in the fight</v>

7
00:00:17.341 --> 00:00:18.174
<v Speaker 1>right there for doom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember seeing [inaudible] I </v>

8
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.650
<v Speaker 1>call home or anything on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.070
<v Speaker 1>I did see that jump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that jump psychic in the beginning.</v>

10
00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:27.553
<v Speaker 1>You get the hand on his trainer res.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a cool without that fight there </v>

<v Speaker 1>Well it was,</v>

13
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:33.413
<v Speaker 1>it was Obama to me to see Travis fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that because I remember travis </v>

14
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.600
<v Speaker 1>earlier in his career was just to look </v>
<v Speaker 1>at that picture.</v>

15
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.660
<v Speaker 1>That is fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Esther,</v>

16
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.350
<v Speaker 1>Esther Lynn from all elbows on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Instagram,</v>

17
00:00:46.351 --> 00:00:49.380
<v Speaker 1>put this picture up and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's an mma,</v>

18
00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:50.280
<v Speaker 1>a photographer.</v>

19
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.200
<v Speaker 1>She takes awesome pictures to an awesome</v>
<v Speaker 1>picture.</v>

20
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.520
<v Speaker 1>And this is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

21
00:00:53.521 --> 00:00:56.670
<v Speaker 1>it is literally knuckled deep in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyeball.</v>

22
00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.710
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to look at,</v>

23
00:00:58.711 --> 00:00:59.550
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

24
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.290
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That though too.</v>

25
00:01:01.291 --> 00:01:02.440
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's middle knuckle.</v>

26
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.610
<v Speaker 1>It's like this finger has disappeared in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the eyeball.</v>

27
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember him stopping or saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>I poke or anything.</v>

28
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's focus.</v>

29
00:01:09.871 --> 00:01:14.100
<v Speaker 1>But there was a bad one earlier in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>night with Jimmy Rivera and a Uriah.</v>

30
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a bad one.</v>

31
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.570
<v Speaker 1>And Jimmy Rivera after the fights that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't see,</v>

32
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.220
<v Speaker 1>you still couldn't see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

33
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.010
<v Speaker 1>he said he couldn't tell what color </v>
<v Speaker 1>things were out of his right eye.</v>

34
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking I pokes man.</v>

35
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:27.203
<v Speaker 1>Pride gloves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

36
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.123
<v Speaker 1>You got to redesign the gloves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A little bit of a car to turn there and </v>

37
00:01:29.691 --> 00:01:30.660
<v Speaker 1>that opened all the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

38
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.860
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're right.</v>

39
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.930
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what I do.</v>

40
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.540
<v Speaker 1>I obsess about Marsha lives to making </v>
<v Speaker 1>things better.</v>

41
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.390
<v Speaker 1>Someone's got to do something because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way things are going,</v>

42
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.253
<v Speaker 1>we're just so many guys are getting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go so many guys getting damaged </v>

43
00:01:42.451 --> 00:01:43.560
<v Speaker 1>eyeballs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

44
00:01:43.561 --> 00:01:44.880
<v Speaker 1>it's not worth it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

45
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.700
<v Speaker 1>And it seems like we're waiting for </v>
<v Speaker 1>something terrible to happen.</v>

46
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.440
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like look at Michael Bisping,</v>

47
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.350
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bisping's came from a kick though.</v>

48
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.600
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it might have come from </v>
<v Speaker 1>vittores kick.</v>

49
00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.690
<v Speaker 1>What was it that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or was it in practice?</v>

50
00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it was in practice?</v>

51
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.100
<v Speaker 1>I think he detached his retina a couple </v>
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>

52
00:02:02.101 --> 00:02:03.720
<v Speaker 1>so I think that's why it is the way it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

53
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.470
<v Speaker 1>I think he's heard it multiple times and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was kind of where it,</v>

54
00:02:07.471 --> 00:02:09.540
<v Speaker 1>cause it's not completely fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they fixed it enough to where he</v>

55
00:02:09.541 --> 00:02:10.374
<v Speaker 1>can fight and then when he's done </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting they'll probably fix is I </v>

56
00:02:11.761 --> 00:02:12.594
<v Speaker 1>completed these what it seems like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what they did is they stuck oil in </v>

57
00:02:15.061 --> 00:02:15.894
<v Speaker 1>his eye.</v>

58
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.003
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of his eyeballs apparently has </v>

59
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.113
<v Speaker 1>oil in it that's protecting the retina.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's why one of his eyeballs is </v>

60
00:02:24.661 --> 00:02:26.500
<v Speaker 1>black,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you know.</v>

61
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.413
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was wondering what was going on with </v>

62
00:02:27.931 --> 00:02:28.800
<v Speaker 1>desires.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why.</v>

63
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:29.683
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is black and one is his original </v>

64
00:02:31.021 --> 00:02:32.280
<v Speaker 1>aicar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I'm not sure what it is,</v>

65
00:02:32.281 --> 00:02:34.530
<v Speaker 1>but it's very strange looking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just,</v>

66
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.040
<v Speaker 1>he's a fucking savage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he didn't even consider retiring.</v>

67
00:02:38.041 --> 00:02:38.531
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

68
00:02:38.531 --> 00:02:39.540
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stick some oil in there.</v>

69
00:02:39.541 --> 00:02:41.910
<v Speaker 1>Let's get going whenever I reckon do put</v>
<v Speaker 1>an eyepatch on.</v>

70
00:02:41.911 --> 00:02:44.070
<v Speaker 1>Let's do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got To get back to the gym mate.</v>

71
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.460
<v Speaker 1>He does push it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy comes to fight.</v>

72
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.313
<v Speaker 1>He such an Amo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael Bisping is the middleweight </v>

73
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.010
<v Speaker 1>champion of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And who saw that coming?</v>

74
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.320
<v Speaker 1>He did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did.</v>

75
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.010
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I seen that opening in,</v>

76
00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.641

78
00:02:58.351 --> 00:02:59.260
<v Speaker 1>leading up to the fight.</v>

79
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.720
<v Speaker 1>I seen the same thing his trainer saw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

80
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just leaned it back.</v>

81
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.963
<v Speaker 1>He was telling me weeks before the fight</v>
<v Speaker 1>that things he was doing while he's </v>

82
00:03:06.851 --> 00:03:07.684
<v Speaker 1>hitting meds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dropping his right hand all the time </v>

83
00:03:08.711 --> 00:03:11.670
<v Speaker 1>with his left cross and kind of leaning </v>
<v Speaker 1>back and kind of shoulder roll and,</v>

84
00:03:11.671 --> 00:03:12.504
<v Speaker 1>and whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Duane called it out a couple of </v>

85
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.430
<v Speaker 1>weeks before the fight that he saw </v>
<v Speaker 1>openings.</v>

86
00:03:15.431 --> 00:03:16.264
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't say he was gonna get knocked </v>

87
00:03:16.481 --> 00:03:17.950
<v Speaker 1>out with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he saw some openings there,</v>

88
00:03:17.951 --> 00:03:18.784
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there,</v>

89
00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty simple.</v>

90
00:03:20.251 --> 00:03:22.300
<v Speaker 1>You can see where the openings are on </v>
<v Speaker 1>that one for sure.</v>

91
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:23.141
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

92
00:03:23.141 --> 00:03:25.890
<v Speaker 1>I remember after bisbing caught him and </v>
<v Speaker 1>his trainer point Adam,</v>

93
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.530
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not quite sure what he said and </v>
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>

94
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:28.720
<v Speaker 1>but he was for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was saying,</v>

95
00:03:28.721 --> 00:03:30.300
<v Speaker 1>I could see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told you I told you like that one.</v>

96
00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

97
00:03:32.861 --> 00:03:34.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a good boxing coach.</v>

98
00:03:34.241 --> 00:03:36.010
<v Speaker 1>He understands the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got respect for that guy.</v>

99
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.173
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's cool to see something you've </v>

100
00:03:38.231 --> 00:03:41.230
<v Speaker 1>trained multiple times come out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually work.</v>

101
00:03:41.231 --> 00:03:42.970
<v Speaker 1>And then when the fight and then the </v>
<v Speaker 1>title fight.</v>

103
00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.590
<v Speaker 1>that's nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's rewarding.</v>

104
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:46.733
<v Speaker 1>That's what I wanted to bring up to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did you think about the Travis </v>

105
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.593
<v Speaker 1>Browne?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fabrizio over doing five where we're </v>

106
00:03:50.411 --> 00:03:53.940
<v Speaker 1>travis called time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got his finger jammed for Breeshia,</v>

107
00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.270
<v Speaker 1>threw a punch and Travis Travis has </v>
<v Speaker 1>finger apparently broke and there's some</v>

108
00:03:58.271 --> 00:04:00.130
<v Speaker 1>photos of it now online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

109
00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.550
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

110
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:02.573
<v Speaker 1>shows you how tough travis is that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>continued with his finger was smashed </v>

111
00:04:06.161 --> 00:04:09.430
<v Speaker 1>and it was a compound fracture where the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bone broke through the skin.</v>

112
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:10.743
<v Speaker 1>That's one picture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's some even better ones that </v>

113
00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:13.120
<v Speaker 1>he released today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

114
00:04:13.121 --> 00:04:14.170
<v Speaker 1>you could see it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

115
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.100
<v Speaker 1>after the fight.</v>

116
00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:16.683
<v Speaker 1>It was a nasty break,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so it was a weird thing where for </v>

117
00:04:19.551 --> 00:04:20.384
<v Speaker 1>resale through this punch and he threw </v>
<v Speaker 1>like one of those chocolate dell style </v>
