22
00:00:20.581 --> 00:00:21.630
<v Speaker 1>making them in an ice cream,</v>

23

<v Speaker 1>like bake him in a pie with whipped cream because you know it's,</v>

24
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:24.580
<v Speaker 1>that's how you certificate.</v>

25
00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:25.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a knife to the throat.</v>

26
00:00:25.741 --> 00:00:25.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

27
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:26.803
<v Speaker 1>she was four,</v>

28
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.800
<v Speaker 1>but she loves the big invisible guy stories.</v>

29
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.120
<v Speaker 1>She loves the Noah one.</v>

30
00:00:30.121 --> 00:00:32.490
<v Speaker 1>She loves the Adam and Eve one with the snake and the apple.</v>

31
00:00:32.491 --> 00:00:32.761
<v Speaker 1>It's all,</v>

32
00:00:32.761 --> 00:00:33.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

33
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.520
<v Speaker 1>these stories that they've stood the test of time.</v>

34
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.240
<v Speaker 1>There's really some of the best stories around who was going to kill his,</v>

35
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.080
<v Speaker 1>his son was Cain and Abel.</v>

36
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.130
<v Speaker 1>Now Cain and Abel,</v>

37
00:00:41.131 --> 00:00:42.450
<v Speaker 1>where the son of Adam and eve,</v>

38
00:00:42.451 --> 00:00:44.280
<v Speaker 1>they were brothers and they killed each other.</v>

39
00:00:44.281 --> 00:00:44.580
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

40
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:45.780
<v Speaker 1>I said Isaac and Abraham,</v>

41
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.480
<v Speaker 1>I think Isaac and I,</v>

42
00:00:47.481 --> 00:00:48.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

43
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.150
<v Speaker 1>do we have a web?</v>

44
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:50.430
<v Speaker 1>Abraham?</v>

45
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.440
<v Speaker 1>Abraham was going to go,</v>

46
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:52.000
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

47
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

48
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.940
<v Speaker 1>So I think God is asking him to kill the son for him.</v>

49
00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

50
00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:56.881
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

51
00:00:56.881 --> 00:00:57.660
<v Speaker 1>as a love test.</v>

52
00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

53
00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:58.681
<v Speaker 1>Just because you know,</v>

54
00:00:58.681 --> 00:00:59.820
<v Speaker 1>that's how you know,</v>

55
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.470
<v Speaker 1>if someone really loves you,</v>

56
00:01:01.471 --> 00:01:01.741
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

57
00:01:01.741 --> 00:01:01.951
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

58
00:01:01.951 --> 00:01:02.491
<v Speaker 1>this is why,</v>

59
00:01:02.491 --> 00:01:02.761
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

60
00:01:02.761 --> 00:01:03.540
<v Speaker 1>you give this,</v>

61
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.200
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

62
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.951
<v Speaker 1>you give this to your,</v>

63
00:01:04.951 --> 00:01:05.611
<v Speaker 1>to your wife,</v>

64
00:01:05.611 --> 00:01:05.821
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

65
00:01:05.821 --> 00:01:06.420
<v Speaker 1>like I would,</v>

66
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.860
<v Speaker 1>I would murder our offspring for you.</v>

67
00:01:07.861 --> 00:01:11.130
<v Speaker 1>And that's the hallmark card that really helps your wife understand how much you</v>

68
00:01:11.131 --> 00:01:11.341
<v Speaker 1>love her.</v>

69
00:01:11.341 --> 00:01:14.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm just as an ex boyfriend murdering our right.</v>

70
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.350
<v Speaker 1>I would find out where your next boyfriend the beat you up.</v>

71
00:01:16.351 --> 00:01:17.184
<v Speaker 1>I'll murder him.</v>

72
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.083
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

73
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:19.030
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

74
00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.180
<v Speaker 1>and I'm trying to tell the stories in a neutral way,</v>

75
00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:21.391
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

76
00:01:21.391 --> 00:01:21.741
<v Speaker 1>Like it's,</v>

77
00:01:21.741 --> 00:01:21.841
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

78
00:01:21.841 --> 00:01:22.081
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

79
00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:22.500
<v Speaker 1>I had my,</v>

80
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.270
<v Speaker 1>my opinions on all these stories and all that,</v>

81
00:01:24.271 --> 00:01:27.840
<v Speaker 1>but she really likes the stories and she's a huge fan of Lucifer.</v>

82
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.830
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

83
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:29.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

84
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.630
<v Speaker 1>Lucifer is the guy,</v>

85
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.220
<v Speaker 1>he is like her superhero,</v>

86
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.551
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

87
00:01:32.551 --> 00:01:34.470
<v Speaker 1>like he is her mighty morphin power rangers.</v>

88
00:01:34.471 --> 00:01:37.800
<v Speaker 1>She thinks he is just the coolest cause he's always standing up to big invisible</v>

89
00:01:37.801 --> 00:01:38.011
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

90
00:01:38.011 --> 00:01:38.281
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

91
00:01:38.281 --> 00:01:40.040
<v Speaker 1>And because she,</v>

92
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.250
<v Speaker 1>for her prayer is,</v>

93
00:01:41.251 --> 00:01:41.491
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

94
00:01:41.491 --> 00:01:42.510
<v Speaker 1>everyone's standing around and say,</v>

95
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:43.440
<v Speaker 1>oh you're the best.</v>

96
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.070
<v Speaker 1>Oh you're the best.</v>

97
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.790
<v Speaker 1>Oh you're the greatest.</v>

98
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:45.570
<v Speaker 1>I love you so much.</v>

99
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.111
<v Speaker 1>Oh you're the best.</v>

100
00:01:46.111 --> 00:01:46.410
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

101
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:47.110
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

102
00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:47.461
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

103
00:01:47.461 --> 00:01:50.280
<v Speaker 1>Lucifer gets kind of tired of that and leads the rebellion and all that.</v>

104
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:51.001
<v Speaker 1>Cause you know,</v>

105
00:01:51.001 --> 00:01:51.350
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

106
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

107
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.411
<v Speaker 1>just keep saying it.</v>

108
00:01:52.411 --> 00:01:52.711
<v Speaker 1>And she said,</v>

109
00:01:52.711 --> 00:01:53.461
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting tired of it.</v>

110
00:01:53.461 --> 00:01:53.871
<v Speaker 1>It's like no,</v>

111
00:01:53.871 --> 00:01:53.980
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

112
00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:54.061
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

113
00:01:54.061 --> 00:01:56.570
<v Speaker 1>It keeps saying it because it's an eternity of saying that to the gate.</v>

114
00:01:56.571 --> 00:01:57.120
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

115
00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.540
<v Speaker 1>And she's like,</v>

116
00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.931
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>

117
00:01:57.931 --> 00:01:58.561
<v Speaker 1>I'm really tired.</v>

118
00:01:58.561 --> 00:01:59.230
<v Speaker 1>I want to sit down.</v>

119
00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.130
<v Speaker 1>It's like now you know how Lucifer it.</v>

120
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.461
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

121
00:02:02.461 --> 00:02:03.510
<v Speaker 1>so she's got this great,</v>

122
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.010
<v Speaker 1>she's just great song,</v>

123
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.370
<v Speaker 1>which goes basically Lucifer was raw hide.</v>

124
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:09.790
<v Speaker 1>Lucifer was right.</v>

125
00:02:09.791 --> 00:02:10.100
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

126
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.070
<v Speaker 1>why the songs,</v>

127
00:02:11.071 --> 00:02:11.970
<v Speaker 1>and I'm just waiting.</v>

128
00:02:11.971 --> 00:02:12.481
<v Speaker 1>Cause you know,</v>

129
00:02:12.481 --> 00:02:14.030
<v Speaker 1>in Canada there's some homeschooling,</v>

130
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.140
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of what are in schooling,</v>

131
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.601
<v Speaker 1>what we were doing.</v>

132
00:02:15.601 --> 00:02:16.434
<v Speaker 1>But a lot of them are,</v>

133
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.041
<v Speaker 1>are Christians.</v>

134
00:02:17.041 --> 00:02:17.251
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

135
00:02:17.251 --> 00:02:20.340
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to at some point be around a bunch of Christian kids and she's</v>

136
00:02:20.341 --> 00:02:21.770
<v Speaker 1>going to break into this song and I just,</v>

137
00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking forward to that moment of,</v>

138
00:02:24.381 --> 00:02:27.660
<v Speaker 1>I've tried to explain that maybe she's referring to a Beatles song.</v>

139
00:02:27.661 --> 00:02:29.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how I completely bail on her at that point.</v>

140
00:02:29.791 --> 00:02:30.624
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where she gets this.</v>

141
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.490
<v Speaker 1>And when you structure your stories,</v>

142
00:02:32.491 --> 00:02:37.290
<v Speaker 1>do you use a software program to use index cards on a bulletin board?</v>

143
00:02:37.291 --> 00:02:41.880
<v Speaker 1>Like how do you set up where you're moving all your pieces in your tetris game?</v>

144
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.560
<v Speaker 2>I used to things we do use,</v>

145
00:02:43.561 --> 00:02:48.561
<v Speaker 2>I got a magnetic whiteboard in the office and write on the index cards and put</v>

146
00:02:49.441 --> 00:02:51.210
<v Speaker 2>them all up with that and sometimes you know,</v>

147
00:02:51.211 --> 00:02:52.290
<v Speaker 2>strings between the cards,</v>

148
00:02:52.291 --> 00:02:52.891
<v Speaker 2>that kind of thing.</v>

149
00:02:52.891 --> 00:02:56.130
<v Speaker 2>That's the general getting it all down the flow.</v>

150
00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.470
<v Speaker 2>And then I use a program called scrivener,</v>

151
00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.590
<v Speaker 2>which people can use for Mac or PC and it's basically the same thing.</v>

152
00:03:02.591 --> 00:03:05.860
<v Speaker 2>It's little index cards in the computer and there's an index card that</v>

153
00:03:05.861 --> 00:03:07.570
<v Speaker 2>represents a document,</v>

154
00:03:07.571 --> 00:03:09.010
<v Speaker 2>each document as a chapter.</v>

155
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.031
<v Speaker 2>But it's great.</v>

156
00:03:10.031 --> 00:03:14.620
<v Speaker 2>It's better than Microsoft word because Microsoft word,</v>

157
00:03:14.621 --> 00:03:15.880
<v Speaker 2>once you get a bit past a hundred pages,</v>

158
00:03:15.881 --> 00:03:16.451
<v Speaker 2>200 pages,</v>

159
00:03:16.451 --> 00:03:19.630
<v Speaker 2>you're copying big chunks and moving around and it becomes a nightmare cause</v>

160
00:03:19.631 --> 00:03:20.650
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna screw something up.</v>

161
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:22.391
<v Speaker 2>But Scribner,</v>

162
00:03:22.391 --> 00:03:24.760
<v Speaker 2>he just grabbed this icon and drag it before this icon.</v>

163
00:03:24.761 --> 00:03:25.810
<v Speaker 2>It rearranges everything.</v>

164
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.420
<v Speaker 2>So I've gotten pretty adept at using that a highly recommend it.</v>

165
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.030
<v Speaker 2>It's great for scatterbrain to keep everything flowing.</v>

166
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:32.800
<v Speaker 2>And then a lot of times it'll just be,</v>

167
00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:33.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

168
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.430
<v Speaker 2>I get overwhelmed with the screen and everything going on and I'll just pull up</v>

169
00:03:36.431 --> 00:03:39.340
<v Speaker 2>the three by five index cards and start writing everything down again,</v>

170
00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.700
<v Speaker 2>bullet points and those put them up on the board and go through it that way.</v>

171
00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.150
<v Speaker 1>So you like to do it digitally,</v>

172
00:03:45.151 --> 00:03:46.680
<v Speaker 1>you liked to do it manually.</v>

173
00:03:46.681 --> 00:03:50.670
<v Speaker 1>You like to just mix it up and constantly keep doing it in a different way that</v>

174
00:03:50.671 --> 00:03:51.960
<v Speaker 1>keeps your brain moving?</v>

175
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

176
00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.480
<v Speaker 2>What I find is when you get stuck there,</v>

177
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:55.620
<v Speaker 2>there's a couple of different things.</v>

178
00:03:55.621 --> 00:03:55.981
<v Speaker 2>Number one,</v>

179
00:03:55.981 --> 00:03:57.020
<v Speaker 2>if you just staring at that screen,</v>

180
00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.880
<v Speaker 2>you're stuck just getting your hands involved and a pen.</v>

181
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:00.171
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

182
00:04:00.171 --> 00:04:00.311
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

183
00:04:00.311 --> 00:04:03.300
<v Speaker 2>like just an ink pen and paper is a tactile experiences,</v>

184
00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:04.021
<v Speaker 2>different experience.</v>

185
00:04:04.021 --> 00:04:06.270
<v Speaker 2>It activates different parts of your brain sometimes can like,</v>

186
00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:07.260
<v Speaker 2>oh now I get it,</v>

187
00:04:07.261 --> 00:04:08.430
<v Speaker 2>now I see what I was stuck on.</v>

188
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:09.750
<v Speaker 2>So that's part of it.</v>

189
00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:12.180
<v Speaker 2>And other parts of it is either,</v>

190
00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.850
<v Speaker 2>there's only so much screen real estate so you can only see so many things at</v>

191
00:04:14.851 --> 00:04:15.684
<v Speaker 2>one time.</v>

192
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:16.681
<v Speaker 2>If you're really stuck,</v>

193
00:04:16.681 --> 00:04:17.310
<v Speaker 2>you pull back,</v>

194
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.581
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

195
00:04:17.581 --> 00:04:18.361
<v Speaker 2>All these index cards,</v>

196
00:04:18.361 --> 00:04:18.961
<v Speaker 2>you put it up in this,</v>

197
00:04:18.961 --> 00:04:19.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

198
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.670
<v Speaker 2>four foot by five foot whiteboard and you kind of look at everything that can</v>

199
00:04:23.671 --> 00:04:25.530
<v Speaker 2>spring your brain free at times too.</v>

200
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.240
<v Speaker 2>So it's largely,</v>

201
00:04:27.241 --> 00:04:28.370
<v Speaker 2>it's grabbing whatever's,</v>

202
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.760
<v Speaker 2>if I get stuck in one area,</v>

203
00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.870
<v Speaker 2>I'll start going to other areas and um,</v>

204
00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.280
<v Speaker 2>when I get really overwhelmed and frustrated,</v>

205
00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.830
<v Speaker 2>I am more comfortable slipping back into,</v>

206
00:04:37.831 --> 00:04:38.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

207
00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.420
<v Speaker 2>the eight year old version of me,</v>

208
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.440
<v Speaker 2>which is a little piece of paper and some notes or an next card and go back and</v>

209
00:04:43.441 --> 00:04:45.600
<v Speaker 2>just ride it out until it all kind of flows onto the page.</v>

210
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:46.500
<v Speaker 2>I think Colorado,</v>

211
00:04:46.501 --> 00:04:47.101
<v Speaker 2>Washington,</v>

212
00:04:47.101 --> 00:04:51.330
<v Speaker 2>and eventually Arizona will be great testers to disprove all that bullshit</v>

213
00:04:51.331 --> 00:04:52.400
<v Speaker 2>that's being said about Marilyn.</v>

214
00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:53.520
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what they're doing though?</v>

215
00:04:53.521 --> 00:04:54.750
<v Speaker 1>It's really sneaky thing.</v>

216
00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.650
<v Speaker 1>The Colorado dispensaries,</v>

217
00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:58.230
<v Speaker 1>they have dispensary's of,</v>

218
00:04:58.231 --> 00:04:59.220
<v Speaker 1>they've had for a long time.</v>

219
00:04:59.221 --> 00:05:00.360
<v Speaker 1>They had them back when I lived there,</v>

220
00:05:00.361 --> 00:05:02.970
<v Speaker 1>but they have actual retail stores,</v>

221
00:05:02.971 --> 00:05:04.530
<v Speaker 1>but they're not allowed to have bank accounts.</v>

222
00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.840
<v Speaker 1>So they have massive amounts of cash and the government literally will not let</v>

223
00:05:09.841 --> 00:05:11.550
<v Speaker 1>them put it in a federal bank.</v>

224
00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.170
<v Speaker 1>They can't put it in a state bank.</v>

225
00:05:13.171 --> 00:05:13.681
<v Speaker 1>The can't put it,</v>

226
00:05:13.681 --> 00:05:14.610
<v Speaker 1>they can't put it in a bank.</v>

227
00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.430
<v Speaker 1>They don't allow them to put their business to take the,</v>

228
00:05:17.431 --> 00:05:18.080
<v Speaker 1>so they're gonna,</v>

229
00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.320
<v Speaker 1>they're gonna have a safe somewhere and put stacks of fucking paper money.</v>

230
00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:23.070
<v Speaker 1>Is this,</v>

231
00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.760
<v Speaker 1>you gotta remember to count it or like what are you talking about?</v>

232
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.800
<v Speaker 1>This is the stupidest idea ever.</v>

233
00:05:28.801 --> 00:05:29.091
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

234
00:05:29.091 --> 00:05:29.970
<v Speaker 1>you can make money,</v>

235
00:05:29.971 --> 00:05:31.170
<v Speaker 1>but you can't put it in a bank.</v>

236
00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.100
<v Speaker 2>Here's even worse.</v>

237
00:05:32.101 --> 00:05:36.390
<v Speaker 2>You've probably heard about in Denver where they have outlets for picking up</v>

238
00:05:36.391 --> 00:05:36.960
<v Speaker 2>marijuana,</v>

239
00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:37.380
<v Speaker 2>but you,</v>

240
00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.870
<v Speaker 2>there's no place legally designated to smoke it.</v>

241
00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.280
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious too.</v>

242
00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:42.911
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

243
00:05:42.911 --> 00:05:44.620
<v Speaker 1>They even have these sniff machines.</v>

244
00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:45.251
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen him?</v>

245
00:05:45.251 --> 00:05:45.671
<v Speaker 1>They put on,</v>

246
00:05:45.671 --> 00:05:48.850
<v Speaker 1>they've developed these things to pick out nano particles in the air and they</v>

247
00:05:48.851 --> 00:05:49.720
<v Speaker 1>put it over their nose.</v>

248
00:05:49.721 --> 00:05:51.040
<v Speaker 1>Like you're watching a fucking movie.</v>

249
00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.620
<v Speaker 1>They're sniffing to smell.</v>

250
00:05:52.621 --> 00:05:55.300
<v Speaker 1>If they could smell marijuana from your home outside your home,</v>

251
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:56.470
<v Speaker 1>and if they can,</v>

252
00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.700
<v Speaker 1>they will give you a ticket.</v>

253
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:01.700
<v Speaker 1>It's a new way to make money with a giant electric.</v>

254
00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:02.211
<v Speaker 1>It looks like.</v>

255
00:06:02.211 --> 00:06:05.570
<v Speaker 1>I was like a cartoon knows this guy's got like a space knows on.</v>

256
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:06.380
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen it?</v>

257
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:06.531
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

258
00:06:06.531 --> 00:06:07.364
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen it.</v>

259
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:08.203
<v Speaker 1>There's the,</v>

260
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.580
<v Speaker 1>there's a thing and when they made it illegal,</v>

261
00:06:10.581 --> 00:06:13.790
<v Speaker 1>half the people in Congress didn't even realize that they had made marijuana</v>

262
00:06:13.791 --> 00:06:14.181
<v Speaker 1>illegal.</v>

263
00:06:14.181 --> 00:06:14.580
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>

264
00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:15.950
<v Speaker 1>Notice the electronic nose.</v>

265
00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:19.550
<v Speaker 1>It's got a compass on the end of it and shit to tell you where the smoke is</v>

266
00:06:19.551 --> 00:06:20.030
<v Speaker 1>coming from.</v>

267
00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:21.230
<v Speaker 1>This is so stupid.</v>

268
00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:22.371
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>

269
00:06:22.371 --> 00:06:23.900
<v Speaker 1>That's a giant electric piggy.</v>

270
00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.300
<v Speaker 1>That's a pig with electric piggy.</v>

271
00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:27.673
<v Speaker 1>That's what that is.</v>

272
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:28.281
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

273
00:06:28.281 --> 00:06:29.780
<v Speaker 1>you're a pig if that's what you do.</v>

274
00:06:29.781 --> 00:06:32.450
<v Speaker 1>If you stand in front of people's houses with a fucking electronic sniffer,</v>

275
00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:33.620
<v Speaker 1>not even your own nose.</v>

276
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:34.633
<v Speaker 1>You're a pig.</v>

277
00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.330
<v Speaker 1>You trying to arrest them because they're smoking something that's now legal</v>

278
00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:39.111
<v Speaker 1>inside their house,</v>

279
00:06:39.111 --> 00:06:40.250
<v Speaker 1>but they left a window open.</v>

280
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.233
<v Speaker 1>You're a pig.</v>

281
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:42.080
<v Speaker 1>That's a pig.</v>

282
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.100
<v Speaker 1>Aussie disgusting.</v>

283
00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:43.910
<v Speaker 1>I love technology.</v>

284
00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:45.650
<v Speaker 1>Electronic fucking fake knows</v>

285
00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:51.080
<v Speaker 1>the guy who made that must have been laughing like a music fuck owned.</v>

286
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:54.220
<v Speaker 1>He was probably so high when he so that patent,</v>

287
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:55.730
<v Speaker 1>he didn't even realize he fucked us.</v>

288
00:06:55.731 --> 00:06:56.770
<v Speaker 1>Me and who?</v>

289
00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:00.740
<v Speaker 1>He's one of us and he fucked us with his stupid electric robot knows,</v>

290
00:07:00.741 --> 00:07:02.900
<v Speaker 1>but he made lots of money so he can go to Colorado,</v>
