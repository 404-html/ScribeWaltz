1
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.420
Three,
two,
one,
boom.
What's up brother?
We'll see you my friend.

2
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.920
Oh ways.
Thanks for having wild man.
Yeah,
we both been busy.

3
00:00:10.921 --> 00:00:14.130
It's crazy.
And in the meantime we'd became legal.
Yes,

4
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.960
you guys were at the forefront,
man.
You guys were way ahead.

5
00:00:18.961 --> 00:00:23.730
You were ahead of everybody.
You know,
we took a shot,
he took a shot,

6
00:00:23.731 --> 00:00:27.040
you know,
it's donors and advocates and whatnot.
You know,

7
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.040
we were stoners at first.
Right.
You know,
that's how you start.
Like,
you know,

8
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.910
your friend says,
hey man,
try this.
Or you're the one who says try this.
Right.

9
00:00:35.911 --> 00:00:38.700
It's one or the other.
And you know,

10
00:00:38.701 --> 00:00:42.810
eventually you start getting into the high times magazines and stuff like that

11
00:00:42.811 --> 00:00:45.810
and looking at the,
you know,
the center full pictures of the weed.

12
00:00:45.811 --> 00:00:47.890
But also we like,

13
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.380
we like to read too hastily.
So,
you know,

14
00:00:52.381 --> 00:00:55.680
we'd get into some of the activism aspect of it as well.

15
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.990
And that's when we heard names like Jack Herrera,

16
00:00:57.991 --> 00:01:02.280
who pretty much opened our eyes to everything.
And then,
you know,

17
00:01:02.281 --> 00:01:06.450
I think we became real advocates.
You know,
at first,
you know,
we thought we were,

18
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.040
you know,
sort of,
we read the high times of magazines that we were stoners,

19
00:01:11.041 --> 00:01:12.300
so we thought we were advocates,

20
00:01:12.301 --> 00:01:17.040
but like in reading what other freedom fighters were actually doing out there

21
00:01:17.041 --> 00:01:20.250
and protest and rallies and all that stuff.
You know,
we,

22
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.780
we really weren't advocates.
Like we thought we became that later for sure.
Yeah.

23
00:01:24.781 --> 00:01:28.380
Jack was way,
way,
way ahead of the curve and he's just such an interesting story.

24
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.330
Uh,
rest in peace because he was a Goldwater Republican,

25
00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.450
you know,
he was just a button down old school republic.
Yeah.

26
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.800
And then he got a girlfriend and then the girlfriend and got him smoking weed

27
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.370
and then all of a sudden he was like,
man,
this is fucking amazing.
God.

28
00:01:44.371 --> 00:01:48.960
Why am I such a Dick?
What's wrong with me?
Who am I?
What am I doing with my life?

29
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.310
Absolutely.
It totally flipped his life around.
The emperor wears no clothes.

30
00:01:53.311 --> 00:01:55.500
The fucking great book,
man.
Yeah,
it holds,

31
00:01:55.501 --> 00:01:59.040
it holds strong to this day because everything that he said in the book is sort

32
00:01:59.041 --> 00:02:02.450
of happening right now.
All the stuff that they,
you know,
they,
they,
uh,

33
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.490
tried to prevent from happening through all the anti cannabis propaganda.

34
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.050
You see it now and now you see those very companies tried to get into the

35
00:02:13.051 --> 00:02:16.560
industry if they were always on the outside of the waiting,
you know,

36
00:02:16.561 --> 00:02:20.610
there was all like that,
the launching block not quite ready to run,
but uh,

37
00:02:20.611 --> 00:02:24.180
any minute now it's going to get legal.
Yeah,
exactly.
I mean,
you know,
they're,

38
00:02:24.181 --> 00:02:29.181
they're lying in wait with fields like acreage that no one can ever come close

39
00:02:29.341 --> 00:02:32.390
to probably.
Right.
Yeah.
I mean the,

40
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.230
the thing I heard maybe like five years ago before it was legal in Denver,

41
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.990
that was a bit bit longer than that before we got legalization here.
Um,
that,

42
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.460
you know,
companies like Philip Morris and,
and you know,

43
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.690
companies like that we're already buying land in already.

44
00:02:51.691 --> 00:02:54.960
I'm trademarking names,
you know,

45
00:02:54.961 --> 00:02:59.830
for some of the cannabis that we know today so that when they come into the
game,

46
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.060
you know,

47
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.060
they have ownership on some of the names in some of the brands and trademarks

48
00:03:06.581 --> 00:03:10.990
and stuff like that to that.
And obviously the acreage to,

49
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.480
you know,
grow vast sums of cannabis.
You know,

50
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.700
who knows how true that is,
but I don't doubt some of that.

51
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.360
I don't doubt it either.
As sneaky as shit was Ohio,
Ohio was,

52
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.120
they were trying to make it legal,
but if there were going to make it illegal,

53
00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.960
there's only like,
it took two companies that were on Jamie's from Ohio,

54
00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.770
think like four.
But I think that is how it went.
Yeah.

55
00:03:30.771 --> 00:03:32.860
We're the only ones going to be allowed to grow it and sell it.

56
00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.670
Like fuck a fuck you monopoly.
That is not legal weed.

57
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.620
That is you being a cunt.
That's a monopoly and it's crazy,
you know?

58
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.060
Yeah.
Because you know,
you had like people that got those uh,

59
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:51.270
licenses or permits or whatever that had no knowledge on,

60
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.790
on,
on the cannabis culture or,
or business how to cultivate and,

61
00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.180
and how to run retail stores or any of that.

62
00:03:59.181 --> 00:04:01.690
And they didn't have any of that knowledge.
And you know,

63
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.710
Dell usually give it to an insider because they know how much money they stand.

64
00:04:05.711 --> 00:04:10.000
To me that's like if there was just one distribution center,
right,

65
00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.140
and everybody has to go through that distribution center,

66
00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.330
how much money does that distribution center make me?

67
00:04:17.331 --> 00:04:21.010
Cause you gotta pay for your shit to go there.
And then,
you know,
who knows if it,

68
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.120
well,
you know,

69
00:04:22.121 --> 00:04:26.140
if it passes because you know as a cultivator what you did,

70
00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.540
so you'll know it'll pass cause it's clean,

71
00:04:28.541 --> 00:04:32.770
but you still got to pay that fee every time and it's got to go through them.

72
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.770
Fortunately here in California,
you know,

73
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.700
they allowed people to have distribution licenses so that there's not one

74
00:04:39.701 --> 00:04:43.930
distribution center because that would be a monopoly for sure.

75
00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.280
And that's what they wanted to supposedly,
you know,
the lobbyists that,

76
00:04:48.281 --> 00:04:49.900
that puts 64 together.

77
00:04:49.901 --> 00:04:53.550
We're trying to stop it from a monopoly and uh,

78
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.160
corporations coming in and taking over and stuff like that.
You know,

79
00:04:57.161 --> 00:04:58.000
so interesting.

80
00:04:58.001 --> 00:05:03.001
Because pot is such a non-corporate drug and it's such a non corporate thing

81
00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.740
that these corporations were trying to get a grip on weed.
It just,

82
00:05:08.741 --> 00:05:12.010
it seemed,
it seemed obscene.
You know,

83
00:05:12.011 --> 00:05:16.690
it seemed seemed disgusting.
Yeah.
It's a little out of place,
you know,

84
00:05:16.691 --> 00:05:19.920
a lot on a place.
Right.
You know,
because you,
you,

85
00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.800
you think about where it comes from and it's been outlawed for so long.

86
00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.490
It's kind of like,
you know,
the way our alcohol was for so long,

87
00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.950
but as longer than alcohol,
but it's been demonized longer.
Yes.
And now,

88
00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:37.600
you know,
you have people trying to come in and throw money into it and they got,

89
00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.980
you know,

90
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:42.000
in some of these guys don't realize it's not just about the money until you got

91
00:05:42.001 --> 00:05:44.410
to do the diligence on what this business is.

92
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.740
You can't cut corners on the cultivation.
You know,

93
00:05:47.741 --> 00:05:52.390
you can't cut corners on quality because people,
you know,
they're,

94
00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.470
they're,
um,
there's more information out there.

95
00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:57.631
You the ENL,

96
00:05:57.631 --> 00:06:02.631
so people know e even if they're not a connoisseur sewer as a consumer,

97
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.560
you know,
they can,
they can read about shit,
they can learn about stuff.

98
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.040
So if you're getting over on a more,
if you're putting some shit,

99
00:06:10.041 --> 00:06:14.310
quality product out there,
I mean people are gonna know and,

100
00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:18.770
and all that money that these guys put into to trying to get into the cannabis

101
00:06:18.771 --> 00:06:20.660
business,
they're just throwing it into the fire.

102
00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.630
Some of them will come out of it,
you know,

103
00:06:23.631 --> 00:06:27.770
they'll partner up with brands did exist and people that have knowledge,

104
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.960
but you know,
it's,

105
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:34.040
it's the corporations that come in,
in the next five years.

106
00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.060
It's going to be,

107
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:40.480
it's going to be interesting because I do think that it's set up for them to

108
00:06:40.761 --> 00:06:41.594
come in.

109
00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:45.620
The taxes are so high right now for the consumer and for the cultivator and for

110
00:06:45.621 --> 00:06:49.820
the retail shop that you got to survive this wash.

111
00:06:49.821 --> 00:06:54.050
Right now it's happening in order to still be,
you know,

112
00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.890
doing business when the corporate structure comes in because please believe

113
00:06:57.891 --> 00:07:02.891
they're going to lobby so that those taxes come down because the margins are not

114
00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:08.360
right.
You know,
as 40% tax.
Is that what it is now?

115
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:12.530
It was 39 in Denver,
right?
Yeah.
But in here,
in California,
it's,
you know,

116
00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:16.220
40% into the consumer.
The consumer's like,
who gives a fuck?

117
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:20.250
If I could just pull in and get some weed,
really should give a fuck.
Cause,

118
00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:23.330
but in comparison to alcohol,
like how much it costs,

119
00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.780
if you go out for a night for some drinks,
that costs way more.

120
00:07:26.781 --> 00:07:30.440
You get high for a month and what it takes to get pretty much she drinks in a

121
00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:34.370
night.
It depending where you go,
those fucking drinks or even double.
Yeah.
Yeah.

122
00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.880
And with less alcohol.
Well the other thing is that these companies,

123
00:07:37.881 --> 00:07:40.700
they don't understand the culture.
It's a different culture.

124
00:07:40.701 --> 00:07:44.450
You can't bullshit us.
Yeah.
You can't bullshit us with marketing and advertising.

125
00:07:44.451 --> 00:07:45.590
That shit is not going to work.

126
00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:49.340
You can't have like the most interesting man in the world selling weed.
Stay,

127
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:52.610
stay thirsty.
My friends.
No.
Now that ain't going to work.

128
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:56.960
You got to get somebody like Michael Phelps.
Yeah man,

129
00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:03.260
I would buy weed from Michael Phelps.
How funny was that?

130
00:08:03.261 --> 00:08:08.150
That he got in trouble for that?
You know what?
I find it funny is how,
how um,

131
00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:09.500
you know,
they,

132
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:14.440
they put these stereotypes on stoners for so long like that we are lazy and

133
00:08:14.441 --> 00:08:15.620
productive and all that stuff.

134
00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:20.210
This guy's one of the most decorated Olympian in the history.

135
00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:25.400
You know what I mean?
What does he got like 15 gold fucking models.
Preposterous.

136
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:30.040
Yeah.
Mr Big lungs.
That's what we call him mister big lungs.
Fuck.

137
00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.240
I probably could take a rip on a bond.

138
00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:35.470
Think about it and God ain't shit right.

139
00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:39.330
He had it probably is crazy capacity there.
It is.
Probably snap a two gram bull.

140
00:08:39.331 --> 00:08:43.520
This guy,
the person who ratted him out some low,
some kids,

141
00:08:43.521 --> 00:08:47.590
some terp little dickhead.
What a piece of shit.
Yeah.

142
00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:49.790
Imagine it's going to a party trying to have a good time.

143
00:08:49.791 --> 00:08:53.210
Some kids there with his phone.
That's social network for you though.

144
00:08:53.211 --> 00:08:54.710
They want to go viral so they'll,

145
00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:58.530
they'll get you in that moment where you know you're supposed to be a friend.

146
00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:01.740
But that was like before all out of that shit was happening.

147
00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:06.600
Like what year was that?
Let's guess.
What gear was that?
12 2012.

148
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:09.210
Well before.
Yeah.
Before a,

149
00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:14.400
let's just say before,
you know,
uh,
Instagram kicked off,

150
00:09:14.401 --> 00:09:17.130
but there was still youtube and Twitter.
Yeah.
And you know,

151
00:09:17.131 --> 00:09:21.750
if you wanted to put somebody on blast or you wanted to have a viral video,

152
00:09:21.751 --> 00:09:26.460
youtube has been there for a long time.
Yeah.
Twitter was like 2007 right?

153
00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:30.870
It wasn't that.
I believe so.
Yeah.
I think when was Michael,
why don't,

154
00:09:30.871 --> 00:09:34.130
was it Michael Phelps?
When did he get in trouble?
I'm looking at,
I,

155
00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:38.910
I'm seeing different stuff,
so I saw a picture of it on youtube from 2009.

156
00:09:38.911 --> 00:09:41.850
So that means it would have been in 2008 Olympics.
But that seems,

157
00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:45.330
that makes sense.
Like it was a long time ago.
Yeah,
that makes sense though,

158
00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:49.530
because he did it,
came back,
right?
Yeah.
He retired and then he came back,
well,

159
00:09:49.531 --> 00:09:54.420
I think he was suspended.
They get suspended.
2009 is when he got caught.

160
00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.340
And then,
uh,
and then he had to,
you know,

161
00:09:56.341 --> 00:10:00.450
do the suspension and he came back and got some more metals like,
Haha,
fuck you.

162
00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:04.320
Right.
I love that he's suspended because of the weed.
Yeah.

163
00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.440
Well you know,
hey,
listen on,
on uh,

164
00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:12.390
in a lot of places it's still on a a banned substance list.
Oh yeah.
Texas.

165
00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:16.080
Texas is real bad.
February two thought,
well 2009,

166
00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:19.740
he was only 23 apologize can incident where he's caught on camera to party

167
00:10:19.741 --> 00:10:24.360
smoking a bomb that was allegedly marijuana.
He should,

168
00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.000
you know,
he shouldn't have apologized for that.

169
00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:29.760
He shouldn't have had to have apologized for that thing.

170
00:10:29.761 --> 00:10:33.270
Is that they have those guys bent over a box because they're all just trying to

171
00:10:33.271 --> 00:10:37.290
get that sponsorship by right as,
yeah.
You have to be squeaky clean.

172
00:10:37.291 --> 00:10:40.290
If you want to be on the Wheaties box,
you can't be an Olympian.
Yeah,

173
00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.700
they're not going to put Cypress Hill on the Wheaties box.

174
00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:46.760
Wouldn't that be great though,
but take the t h out,

175
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:52.030
add an e and put a d and n I e s n plus go weedies.

176
00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:57.300
Yeah,
I dunno man.
You guys where it's so far ahead of the curve though.
You know,

177
00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:58.590
I mean you,
you were,

178
00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:02.840
you had we'd songs like when like what year that was,
uh,

179
00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:03.950
the,

180
00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:08.950
the first album was in 91 and we started riding for that album probably a four

181
00:11:11.551 --> 00:11:14.810
years prior.
And uh,
you know,
the weeds,

182
00:11:14.811 --> 00:11:19.380
songs those came about because we were,
we'd heads,
you know,
we just fuck it,

183
00:11:19.381 --> 00:11:22.790
let's be ourselves.
Right.
Different thing now for people that were,

184
00:11:22.791 --> 00:11:26.820
were fans because uh,
I,
when I was listening to you,

185
00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:31.880
I was just getting ready to move from Boston to New York and uh,

186
00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:38.180
back then you would hear about new hip hop bands from Mike Friends.
Yeah.

187
00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:41.220
Like you didn't like it was all word of mouth.
Yeah.

188
00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:45.270
I'm not sure I would hear about it like somebody that I think somebody I worked

189
00:11:45.271 --> 00:11:47.640
out with had it and I was like,
what the fuck is this?

190
00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:50.570
And then like that Cypress Hill,
I was like,
Damn.
Yeah,

191
00:11:50.571 --> 00:11:54.400
we're trying to be different.
You know,
I'm not sound a typical west coast,

192
00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:58.420
you know,
group,
because a lot of a lot of west coast groups at that point,

193
00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:03.940
you know,
what the labels were looking for were Nwa,
you know,
types and you know,

194
00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:08.470
things like that.
Like either,
you know,
gangster,
west coast,

195
00:12:08.471 --> 00:12:09.251
gangster rap,

196
00:12:09.251 --> 00:12:13.510
they were looking for that or either the kid frost Chicano type.

197
00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:17.320
And we didn't want to do that.
We didn't want to a foot hold ourselves like that,

198
00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:22.870
you know,
mugs being from New York,
he wanted to sort of blend both worlds,

199
00:12:22.871 --> 00:12:24.940
right.
So,
you know,
we went with,

200
00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:29.410
with the east coast type sound with La,
you know,

201
00:12:29.411 --> 00:12:34.240
type of slang mixed with,
with east coast slang.
And so people,
you know,

202
00:12:34.241 --> 00:12:35.980
they were like,
where the fuck are these guys from?

203
00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:38.590
And people thought we were from Cypress Hill in New York because there's a

204
00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:41.170
Cypress hill down there.
And uh,
you know,

205
00:12:41.171 --> 00:12:44.440
people just didn't really know at first because we were one of the first groups

206
00:12:44.441 --> 00:12:48.820
that didn't put our images on any of our first,
um,
you know,

207
00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:52.900
any of our singles or,
or our art covers.
We never did like the,
the shots,

208
00:12:52.901 --> 00:12:56.350
like you know,
that that were existing at that time where you,

209
00:12:56.351 --> 00:13:00.610
it's a clean shot of the group or the artist or whatever.
We were always on some,

210
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:04.000
you know,
cause we were metal heads too,
you know,
before the hip hop.

211
00:13:04.001 --> 00:13:07.930
We liked the obscure metal albums.
So we didn't,
we were like,

212
00:13:07.931 --> 00:13:09.550
we're not going to put ourselves on the covers.

213
00:13:09.551 --> 00:13:12.940
We're just going to do these crazy obscure covers and make people,
you know,

214
00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:17.560
try to guess who we are.
Be Mysterious,
Dan.
We talk about longevity.

215
00:13:17.561 --> 00:13:18.550
I mean you guys,

216
00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:23.230
you guys have been around a long fucking time and dropped off at all.

217
00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:26.650
It's crazy.
You know.
Um,
we,
we didn't expect it.

218
00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:28.450
We didn't know how long I run would be.

219
00:13:28.451 --> 00:13:31.690
We just kept working with w always had a strong work ethic.

220
00:13:31.691 --> 00:13:36.070
We were never the types just to sit around.
We're always doing something,

221
00:13:36.071 --> 00:13:41.020
you know,
mugs,
always making beats.
Um,
you know,
I'm always writing to something.

222
00:13:41.021 --> 00:13:43.870
I'm always into one project or another.

223
00:13:43.871 --> 00:13:47.960
So it was always just about keeping busy and,
and that,
that,
uh,

224
00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:52.690
suited as well.
It's crazy.
28 years later,
still fanning in it.

225
00:13:52.691 --> 00:13:57.640
It's crazy what you say 28 years later from your first album,

226
00:13:57.641 --> 00:14:01.810
Matt and again,
you guys never dropped off for a second.
Not once.

227
00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:05.710
You were always there.
You have to be consistent in hip hop.
You know,

228
00:14:05.711 --> 00:14:08.050
in music in general,
especially like if,

229
00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:13.080
if there's a time where radio stops playing your music or you know as MTV stop

230
00:14:13.091 --> 00:14:16.940
playing music videos and they went for more um,

231
00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:21.370
reality show type programming,
you got to,
you got to stick out there.

232
00:14:21.371 --> 00:14:24.100
So for us it was,
you know,
constantly doing shows.

233
00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:28.660
We didn't put out as many albums as we could of,
but we thought less was more,

234
00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:29.523
you know,

235
00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:34.060
instead of like drive in the music into your heart like a steak or something

236
00:14:34.061 --> 00:14:38.980
like that.
We just,
you know,
let everything breathe for a while.
And there was,

237
00:14:38.981 --> 00:14:42.790
there was a time where,
you know,
we sort of let go of doing everything.

238
00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:47.080
It was like a six year period where we just kind of took off.
We,
we didn't,

239
00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:49.030
we weren't away completely.

240
00:14:49.031 --> 00:14:53.480
We're still doing like sporadic shows here and there to keep up the profile.

241
00:14:53.481 --> 00:14:57.730
But we weren't like touring and working on music.
I was off fucking around,
uh,

242
00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:02.760
competing in paintball tournaments that couldn't get into paintball.
Oh Man.
Uh,

243
00:15:02.761 --> 00:15:03.021
yeah.

244
00:15:03.021 --> 00:15:07.970
I had a team called stone assassins and it was competitive paintball at the

245
00:15:07.971 --> 00:15:12.710
time.
I was,
you know,
training,
uh,
martial arts is I've done throughout my life.

246
00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:13.573
And,
uh,

247
00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:17.990
I was also playing competitive paintball and a martial arts we're doing showed a

248
00:15:17.991 --> 00:15:22.450
con.
I started off with taekwondo and I got sort of,
I mean it's,

249
00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:27.860
it's like,
it was,
uh,
it was,
the Dojo was cool,
you know,

250
00:15:27.861 --> 00:15:30.470
and,
and I was progressing quickly,

251
00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:34.550
but I sort of fell out with the master there with the sea floor,
whatever.

252
00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:38.060
I can't remember what it is.
Yeah.
And,
uh,

253
00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:42.080
one of my partners who I grew up with who is one of my partners in our Dr. Green

254
00:15:42.081 --> 00:15:47.030
thumb,
um,
Brandon,
whatever his father,
um,
was,

255
00:15:47.031 --> 00:15:51.950
uh,
was,
uh,
you know,
Sensei and his sensei and became my sensei.

256
00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:56.030
I went from taekwondo to shadow con and I started training with him.
I mean,

257
00:15:56.031 --> 00:16:00.560
he had been in the Dojo since he was five years old training with his father.
So,

258
00:16:00.561 --> 00:16:02.570
you know,
I came into that,
it took,

259
00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:07.600
it took a little bit of a convincing for me to go from one thing to another

260
00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:13.220
because it's such a different style.
Um,
but,
you know,

261
00:16:13.221 --> 00:16:18.110
I adapted to it and I liked it and it was,
um,
very different,
less flash,

262
00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:23.090
but uh,
is very disciplined in his father.
You know,
he was,

263
00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:28.310
you know,
born in Japan,
raised out there and he,
he,
you know,
there,

264
00:16:28.311 --> 00:16:30.880
there she is kind of different.
They go to,
to,
to um,

265
00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:35.920
martial arts universities and they get degrees in different martial arts so they

266
00:16:36.771 --> 00:16:38.780
can go and take like,
okay,

267
00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:43.840
hop Kido and Jujitsu and showed [inaudible] and all of this and you know,

268
00:16:43.911 --> 00:16:46.250
get their,
their degrees,
you know,

269
00:16:46.251 --> 00:16:48.740
the work that were up in the belt system and all that stuff.

270
00:16:48.741 --> 00:16:53.150
But they become teachers through,
through that university,
I guess.

271
00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:55.450
Fascinating.
And,
uh,
yeah,
his,

272
00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:59.040
his father was one of the guys in one of the federations that,
uh,

273
00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:01.010
he's one of the three or four Sensei's.

274
00:17:01.011 --> 00:17:05.120
It have to come in and give you the black belt when you actually get it.

275
00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:10.210
Yeah.
What was it?
A S K o f a or something like I got,

276
00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:14.690
you know,
I'm just done karate federation.
So yeah,
something like that.

277
00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:19.610
So you could imagine when Leo Machida came on the scene,
you know,
we were like,

278
00:17:19.611 --> 00:17:23.640
yeah,
someone representing the style that,
you know,
we were trained under anyway.

279
00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:25.400
A lot of people got excited when he came about.

280
00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:29.690
He was really the first guy to legitimize karate in the modern era of mixed

281
00:17:29.691 --> 00:17:32.750
martial arts.
You show up,
like if you could do all those other things,

282
00:17:32.751 --> 00:17:34.520
if you could stuff takedowns and you,

283
00:17:34.521 --> 00:17:37.750
you knew submissions and all those things on top of that you could live.
Yeah,

284
00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:38.330
you could.

285
00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:41.030
And you could do it in a weird way that people didn't really understand his

286
00:17:41.031 --> 00:17:45.230
timing.
And Wonderboy Thompson similar to that too.
It's got a weird timing.

287
00:17:45.231 --> 00:17:47.120
Weird timing,
you know,

288
00:17:47.121 --> 00:17:50.670
and then the faints with the hips and he was good with that shit.
Like you know,

289
00:17:50.671 --> 00:17:54.330
he,
he would throw people off with that.
And you know,
we,

290
00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:59.070
I just happened to go see his fight against Rashad Evans.
Oh Shit.

291
00:17:59.071 --> 00:18:02.880
And a man.
I mean,
it surprised all of us.
I mean,
we thought he would win,

292
00:18:02.881 --> 00:18:05.970
but we didn't know he would win in that fashion.
I mean,
yeah,

293
00:18:05.971 --> 00:18:08.840
he was something special,
you know what I mean?
And he's doing,

294
00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:12.070
but he's over at Bellator now,
right.
With his brother,
his brother Chins.
Oh.

295
00:18:12.071 --> 00:18:14.540
Has Been,
uh,
over there for a while.
His brother,

296
00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:19.590
I think his brother's a Bantam weight or featherweight,
one of those.
But um,
yeah,

297
00:18:19.591 --> 00:18:19.910
that,

298
00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:24.480
that I think it's good to go from taekwondo to other styles because taekwondo

299
00:18:24.481 --> 00:18:27.720
gives you a lot of dexterity.
You weren't going to move your legs easily.
Yes,

300
00:18:27.721 --> 00:18:31.170
absolutely.
It's a good foundation.
Yeah.
It's a good way to start off.

301
00:18:31.171 --> 00:18:34.060
It's good for little kids to the guest that doesn't,
you know,

302
00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:37.290
there's not a lot of head contact.
They're kind of working nation to.
Yeah.

303
00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:40.410
And then when you learn,
if you learn,
if you really actually want to fight,

304
00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:44.100
you want to learn more time.
And I was other things you have way quicker,
legs.

305
00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:47.100
And just move better.
Yeah.
For me,
you know,

306
00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:51.090
I was never good with all those flashy cook kicks like that.
So you know,

307
00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:53.580
big dude.
Yeah.
It was harder for me.
Taekwondo,

308
00:18:53.581 --> 00:18:55.560
like the shadow Khan was definitely hard,

309
00:18:55.561 --> 00:19:00.090
but it was more suited for someone my size and style show the kinds of hard it

310
00:19:00.091 --> 00:19:02.010
is.
And He,
you know,
he,

311
00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:06.210
when he was training as he would not like let up is eat the whole be reels here,

312
00:19:06.211 --> 00:19:10.440
let me go light on him.
Nah,
everything I did like,

313
00:19:10.441 --> 00:19:13.890
you know that they did,
I did outside of music when I tried it.
Like for instance,

314
00:19:13.891 --> 00:19:17.790
paint ball,
when they went into paintball,
there was a price on my head.

315
00:19:17.791 --> 00:19:21.390
Every game,
everybody wanted to give me extra shots.

316
00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:24.240
So like if I got hit well I'm walking out,

317
00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:29.190
I would get 10 20 extra paint balls to my back.
Oh.
You know,

318
00:19:29.191 --> 00:19:31.320
and we'd give it right back to them,
you know,

319
00:19:31.321 --> 00:19:34.230
in the very next game when we played them guys again,

320
00:19:34.231 --> 00:19:38.160
we were making sure to give them that right back.
But you got deep into this.

321
00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:42.560
Oh yeah.
It was man,
it,
it's addicting.
That I got to tell you.
Um,

322
00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:45.720
if there's any physical activity that is addicting.

323
00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:50.750
It is paintball cause it's chest with guns because it's so fast and so close and

324
00:19:50.941 --> 00:19:54.960
you got to think of a strategy,
you know,
it's not all shooting straight way.

325
00:19:54.961 --> 00:19:59.580
It's all shooting angles in getting your guys to positions to get those guys out

326
00:19:59.581 --> 00:20:03.660
to keep moving up,
to get their flag,
wipe them out and bring the flag back.

327
00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:07.290
Now are there restrictions on power?
Like the power of the guns?
Yeah,

328
00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:12.270
I believe you can't shoot above 300 PSI.
I think it's,

329
00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:13.940
I think it's a,

330
00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:17.490
the highest you can shoot as maybe to 85 to 90 at least at the time.

331
00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:21.300
If you go balls out,
if you wanted to get the ultimate paintball gun,

332
00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:23.820
what is that?
Oh man,
it's,
it's,

333
00:20:23.821 --> 00:20:27.760
it's hard because we were using different guns at the time cause it's,

334
00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:31.950
it's like a,
each year a better gun comes out,
the technology gets better.

335
00:20:31.951 --> 00:20:33.270
So you know,

336
00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:37.410
we were using it first when we started these these guns called angels and then

337
00:20:37.411 --> 00:20:40.170
we went over into these other guns.
Fuck,

338
00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:43.050
I can't remember the name of them but they were light.

339
00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:46.500
I mean the best thing is to have a light gun with,

340
00:20:46.501 --> 00:20:51.501
with the that you can fan see cause that's the technique to get it to shoot like

341
00:20:51.581 --> 00:20:53.270
a,
like a Uzi.
Right.

342
00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:56.980
You're not supposed to be able to pull the trigger and multiple balls come out

343
00:20:56.981 --> 00:20:57.850
with one pole.

344
00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:02.800
It's supposed to be that the gun shoots as fast as your,
your,
your,

345
00:21:02.801 --> 00:21:05.140
your two fingers or three can toggle.

346
00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:09.580
So if you get a rhythm you could shoot that thing like a fucking Uzi,

347
00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:13.060
you know,
and everybody has a different position,
you know,
like mine,

348
00:21:13.061 --> 00:21:16.550
I was like one of the quarterbacks,
which is the last three on the line.

349
00:21:16.551 --> 00:21:18.820
See it's like a football field,
right?

350
00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:23.980
You got the 50 and there's obstacles at the 50 and in between and it's mirrored

351
00:21:23.981 --> 00:21:24.814
on the other side.

352
00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:30.090
The quarterbacks play the back and they shoot a whole bunch of paint so that the

353
00:21:30.131 --> 00:21:33.490
other guys that are the front and mid guys can get into these different

354
00:21:33.491 --> 00:21:35.770
positions to shoot the other guys out.

355
00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:38.740
So the guys in the back were shooting the most pain.

356
00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:43.690
So you have to use that fanning,
um,
style.
So using three fingers,

357
00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:48.370
three fingers,
cause the trigger where your,
where the,
the base,

358
00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:51.100
where you're pulling the trigger,
you can fit three fingers there.

359
00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:54.550
It's really for two.
But you could fit three.
Yeah.
This,

360
00:21:54.551 --> 00:21:57.800
this was our team right here.
It's still a necessity.

361
00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:02.730
And we were always pretty stoned when we were planning.
Did that help?
Yeah.
The,

362
00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:06.880
the,
the,
the furthest we went,
we took third place in one tournament.
Wow.
You guys.

363
00:22:06.881 --> 00:22:07.720
So this is crazy.

364
00:22:07.721 --> 00:22:11.080
Like you guys have these barriers and shit and these are all blow up barriers

365
00:22:11.081 --> 00:22:14.530
right here.
It's like a football field.
Yeah.
That's what they would replicate.

366
00:22:14.531 --> 00:22:18.190
Like a football,
soccer field.
And,
uh,
you know,

367
00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:21.130
you put all the,
these,
these obstacles up,

368
00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:26.260
these blow up obstacles and uh,
they're all just positions to,

369
00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:30.220
to try to take,
to get a better angle on the other side.

370
00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:34.450
And what's the ultimate goal to take everybody out?
It's uh,

371
00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:37.630
you get points for taking the other side out,

372
00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:40.960
but you get the maximum points getting their flag and bringing it back to

373
00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:43.120
yourself.
And you know,

374
00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:47.920
you get points for how many guys on your side that are still alive.
So,

375
00:22:47.921 --> 00:22:51.400
you know,
you would get 100% if all seven of your guys were alive,

376
00:22:51.401 --> 00:22:56.380
you killed all of them and brought their flag that ever happened.
Oh yeah.
Damn.

377
00:22:56.381 --> 00:23:01.270
Who are you planning,
uh,
you know,
kids crawling around.
The thing about paintball,

378
00:23:01.271 --> 00:23:05.680
right,
is that,
let's just say there's six tiers,
right?
There's the pros,

379
00:23:05.681 --> 00:23:09.880
there's a semi-pros,
there's the amateurs,
there's the novice,
there's the rookie.

380
00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:13.030
And uh,
each,
each,

381
00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:18.270
each tier had at least 200 teams competing in this wow per tournament.

382
00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:21.630
And these guys back in that time,
I don't know how it,

383
00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:23.800
how it is now cause I haven't competed in a long time,

384
00:23:23.801 --> 00:23:27.250
but they would do five tournaments a year.
One would be in Huntington beach,

385
00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:31.150
the biggest one.
And it was awesome.
They would throw it,
you know,

386
00:23:31.151 --> 00:23:32.920
right next to a surfing tournament.

387
00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:35.980
So like it would just be cross people crossing up,

388
00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:39.040
watching the surfers and they'd come and watch and the paintball then it would

389
00:23:39.041 --> 00:23:39.851
hit,
you know,

390
00:23:39.851 --> 00:23:44.851
Boston and Florida and Las and one other,

391
00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:49.670
one other place.
I can't remember.
But we would do these tournaments.

392
00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:51.800
I was doing them for like four or five years.

393
00:23:51.801 --> 00:23:56.560
And the guy before me that was the,
the ambassador was uh,

394
00:23:56.570 --> 00:24:00.660
one of the,
one of the bgs,
bgs,

395
00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:04.710
the one who passed away first.
Um,
Barry Gibb's wasn't buried.

396
00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:09.350
Now he's the one that always wear the hat.
Um,
he was the shorter one.

397
00:24:09.410 --> 00:24:13.400
So he was a paintball.
She was a paintball fiend.
Like myself.

398
00:24:13.401 --> 00:24:15.920
He owned a store.
He had a team,

399
00:24:15.921 --> 00:24:20.660
I think it was based out of a flow out of Miami and he would compete up until

400
00:24:20.661 --> 00:24:24.620
when he passed away.
He was like the ambassador and I kind of is.
Yeah,

401
00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:29.600
I came in and took his spot when he's,
yeah,
Maurice Maurice Gift.

402
00:24:29.601 --> 00:24:33.410
That's crazy.
I had no idea why you guys are armored the fuck up.

403
00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:36.170
These things won't sting.
Oh Man.

404
00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:40.850
I mean I'd leave with at least 20 paintball bruises,

405
00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:44.500
you know Pr,
you know in one one sitting and you know you're,
you're,

406
00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:47.480
you look like a leopard coming,
coming off after that.

407
00:24:47.481 --> 00:24:51.370
You know who else was a big paintball enthusiasts was William Shatner.
Really?

408
00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:56.030
Yeah.
He would hold these crazy tournaments like in Trekkie style where?

409
00:24:56.031 --> 00:25:00.110
Access scenario game meaning that,
okay,
here's the castle.

410
00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:03.090
I'm going to be in the castle right here.
You guys got it?

411
00:25:03.091 --> 00:25:06.650
Sieged the castle and if you guys can come get me out of here,

412
00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:10.520
you guys win this round and they would see it through the three days.

413
00:25:10.521 --> 00:25:15.521
They'd set up different scenarios like there he goes to a pay phone.

414
00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:20.210
This is crazy.
I would have never guessed.
But how does he run?

415
00:25:20.211 --> 00:25:23.510
He can't run.
Well,
no,
he's old.
He doesn't run.
They,

416
00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:27.890
they put him in a central place and he'll shoot.
Sometimes he would go out there,

417
00:25:27.891 --> 00:25:30.760
but so he would just stay put.
Yeah,
he would stay put.

418
00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:35.330
You would have to protect him.
Old Man paint ball.
He would fight.

419
00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:38.480
He would fight too.
But he would,
he would,
you know,

420
00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:43.440
they would be trying to protect him.
Oh,
that's so crazy.
Yeah.
Wow.
And uh,

421
00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:46.190
I mean there's a bunch of celebrities that,
that paint bald.

422
00:25:46.191 --> 00:25:50.390
Matt Will Smith was paintball and before he did I,
robot really?
He did that.

423
00:25:50.391 --> 00:25:54.530
He came down to the park where we would practice that we played with Tim and his

424
00:25:54.531 --> 00:25:58.430
team.
Um,
but it was a scenario game.
A Joaquin Phoenix,

425
00:25:58.431 --> 00:26:02.510
we MCI Pfeiffer.
I mean,
you'd be surprised how many,

426
00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:06.480
but it looks like fun.
I guess I shouldn't be surprised.
You let off steam.
Yeah.

427
00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:11.180
I mean people on a team,
on a competition team,
you have,

428
00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:16.160
uh,
you have 11 for the roster in seven play at a time and you can,

429
00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:18.920
you know,
switch guys out.
But now it's different.

430
00:26:18.921 --> 00:26:21.800
Now they do like five men in three men teams.

431
00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:25.230
I don't know anything about the new style but you know,
they,

432
00:26:25.231 --> 00:26:28.940
they constantly call me back cause I'm in better shape than I was when I played.

433
00:26:28.941 --> 00:26:31.940
I was a little bit heavier than I was at quarterback.

434
00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:36.290
You know,
it wasn't running too fast then.

435
00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:38.960
But you know that always hit me man.

436
00:26:38.961 --> 00:26:42.170
I'll always get hit on my DM on Igg or Twitter like hey man,

437
00:26:42.171 --> 00:26:46.230
when you come back to paypal feeling like when I get time,

438
00:26:46.231 --> 00:26:50.580
which is probably never,
but it seems like a a big time suck.
Loved it man.

439
00:26:50.581 --> 00:26:54.120
I love to play in the game.
It was so addicting.
It was hard to pull away from it.

440
00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:57.630
I would even at times be coming home from,

441
00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:01.590
from a tour straight into a tournament.
Like I'd get off the plane,

442
00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:05.280
I'd have somebody have my paint ball shit ready and boom straight to the

443
00:27:05.281 --> 00:27:08.630
tournament.
Can't tell you how many times I was doing that.
Yeah.

444
00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:12.930
It's fucking crazy.
It's funny when things get in your blood,
right?

445
00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:16.890
Getting your bones.
Yeah.
That got in my blood like martial arts did.

446
00:27:16.891 --> 00:27:21.240
Cause I was always like an enthusiast like you know,
for,
for a long time,

447
00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:24.390
you know.
And uh,
when I finally started training,

448
00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:27.000
I was training like seven days a week.
Man.

449
00:27:27.001 --> 00:27:31.400
I wouldn't give myself any time off because I wanted to learn fast and I wanted

450
00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:35.330
to absorb it,
you know?
Did you ever fuck with you Jitsu?
No.
Uh,

451
00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:37.350
I always wanted to,
but I never did.

452
00:27:38.410 --> 00:27:42.970
I thought about it and a,
the 10th planet man,
he fit right in.

453
00:27:42.971 --> 00:27:44.850
And I think I will,
you know,

454
00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:48.020
like a lot of people have asked me and invited me cause they know,
you know,

455
00:27:48.021 --> 00:27:52.200
I'm a UFC fan.
I'm a mixed martial arts fan.
I'm a boxing fan,

456
00:27:52.201 --> 00:27:55.980
you know all that shit at,
you know,
a couple of my cousins are,
well,

457
00:27:55.981 --> 00:27:58.080
one of them was a champion professional boxer,

458
00:27:58.081 --> 00:28:03.010
which was Michael Carbo Hall and his nephew.
Your cousin.
Yes,
I met my,

459
00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:08.290
I met him one day at the comedy store.
Yeah.
Long time ago,
man.
Yeah,
when he was a,

460
00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:10.170
when he was a champ,
he was a beast.

461
00:28:10.171 --> 00:28:14.910
He was a beast and his nephew is now now boxing Keenan Carbo.
Oh,

462
00:28:14.911 --> 00:28:17.850
okay,
cool.
So yeah,
you know,
we're rooting for family right there,

463
00:28:17.851 --> 00:28:21.510
but from Arizona,
right?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
So yeah,

464
00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:24.930
I've been invited to,
to,
to,
to,
you know,

465
00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:30.150
come fuck with Jujitsu and I think I,
you know,
I think I will because I mean,

466
00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:32.970
you got to know it,
I think,
I think you,
you know,

467
00:28:32.971 --> 00:28:37.500
it's something that would benefit anyone from to know that.

468
00:28:37.810 --> 00:28:39.420
So it's,
you don't actually,
you know,

469
00:28:39.421 --> 00:28:43.080
get in a fight and have to hurt somebody bad or they hurt you.

470
00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:46.830
You know what I'm saying?
Just choke him.
Just choke him out.

471
00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:52.520
I saw Everlast choke some guy out one night and it was the fucking cause you

472
00:28:52.681 --> 00:28:55.590
know,
he,
he,
he fucks around a little bit and you know,

473
00:28:55.591 --> 00:28:58.890
he knows people that did teach Jujitsu and they've taught him a couple of
things.

474
00:28:58.910 --> 00:29:02.820
And we're at the rainbow one night where we were holding court,

475
00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:05.880
I'm just smoking like it's Amsterdam down there.

476
00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:11.280
And we were having a conversation and he kept hearing some dude across the
cross,

477
00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:13.800
a couple of tables over kept saying,

478
00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:18.240
Everlast this Everlast that and he,
he yo money,

479
00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:20.430
say my name one more time.

480
00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:25.350
And he goes,
Everlast.

481
00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:30.900
And he went back to talking to his people because he did.
Dick Everlast was good.

482
00:29:30.901 --> 00:29:34.230
Come up and do nothing ever lasts.
Went,
walked over to this table,

483
00:29:34.231 --> 00:29:38.200
look to his face,
turned them around real quick and start choking him.

484
00:29:39.730 --> 00:29:44.530
Say My name again.
Muddy say.
Oh man,
it was,

485
00:29:44.531 --> 00:29:47.170
it was hilarious.
But uh,
yeah man,

486
00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:50.970
10th planet is downtown right near where your places.
Yeah.
Yeah.

487
00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:55.090
So your studio or your set up that's,
that's real close to 10 plan Jujitsu.
Yeah,

488
00:29:55.091 --> 00:29:57.230
man.
Just let me know.
I'll set up a will,
man,

489
00:29:57.231 --> 00:30:00.630
you gotta avoid any flat earth conversations that come up.
Oh I,
you know,

490
00:30:00.631 --> 00:30:04.130
like eight years and keep moving.
I get those from,
I get those from time to time.

491
00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:08.500
You know,
I get a flatter stay the fuck off of Youtube,
man,
man.

492
00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:13.420
Yeah,
they get confused.
Yeah,
that's it.
That's the craziest shit.

493
00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:17.950
Cause I always argue like this about the flat earth,
right?
So,
hey listen,

494
00:30:17.951 --> 00:30:20.740
if we got a flatter,
there's an edge,
right?

495
00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:24.250
And there's always thrill seekers looking to do something thrilling.

496
00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:28.990
And there's always a thrill seeker that fucks up and falls right off of that

497
00:30:28.991 --> 00:30:30.040
edge.
Right?

498
00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:34.600
So how many motherfuckers would be fallen off the edge of the earth if we really

499
00:30:34.601 --> 00:30:37.780
had one?
For sure.
You know,
there'll be climbers,

500
00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:41.470
there'd be a bunch of dudes who would try to hang off the edge to take selfies.

501
00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:42.580
Think about it,
right?

502
00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:48.040
12 people this year have died at the Grand Canyon Nest,
the Grand Canyon.

503
00:30:48.041 --> 00:30:51.970
It was that really that many,
that many so far in this year.

504
00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:57.390
And some people die of a heart attack there because you know it's too much for

505
00:30:57.491 --> 00:30:59.710
them to be on that little bridge that they have there,

506
00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:02.470
that that extends past the edge of a canyon.

507
00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:06.970
They put in a little Bridgeway so that you can go and look down.

508
00:31:07.390 --> 00:31:10.180
People have heart attacks,
two people that have had heart attacks from that,

509
00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:14.290
but the other guys are the ones trying to do selfies.

510
00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:18.700
A fallen off fucking bridge and plummeting.
Right.

511
00:31:19.690 --> 00:31:22.540
So you gotta think,
man,
if we had,
if we had a flat earth,

512
00:31:22.541 --> 00:31:27.220
how many people would be visiting the edge off taking a selfie?
Man,

513
00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:31.900
there's no,
you know,
come on.
No doubt.
There'd be teams of people,
teams,

514
00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:35.170
they would travel to flat earth and they would,
they would like rope.
Apparently.

515
00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:38.530
Like Alex Honnold would probably try to climb off the side.

516
00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:39.580
We'd hear it on the news.

517
00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:43.410
Another person has died from falling off the edge of the earth.
Yeah,

518
00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:48.150
it would be 100% that'd be our hundredth flat out.

519
00:31:48.170 --> 00:31:51.010
People would tell you though that the government guards that.
Yeah.
Not.

520
00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:54.730
And are they right?
Yeah.
You can't go near it.
Pro.
Yeah.
Battleships.

521
00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:58.190
Well there wouldn't be just one edge though,
right?
That's true there.

522
00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:02.080
They didn't think that through.
Yeah.
No,
there'd be several ledges if we're flat.

523
00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:04.540
Yeah.
But see,
you got to have that youtube mentality.

524
00:32:04.541 --> 00:32:08.380
You've got to put your head in a little box,
leave it in their fucking,

525
00:32:08.381 --> 00:32:12.370
turn the oven box on and stick your head in.
The government's plucking the edge,

526
00:32:12.371 --> 00:32:16.780
man.
You can't get near it.
Yeah.
It's like we're living in a dome,

527
00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:22.090
you know that's,
yeah,
the Dome,
the Dome theory because there's no space spaces.

528
00:32:22.091 --> 00:32:22.924
Fake

529
00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:28.680
man spoke to what people want to believe in some crazy shit.
You know.
I want to,

530
00:32:28.690 --> 00:32:30.880
how much of them are stoners?
Like most of them,
right?

531
00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:36.430
How many of them are microdosing?
Oh cool.
Yeah,
probably cause you know,

532
00:32:36.431 --> 00:32:40.790
cause cause that's a thing now everybody's like fucking microdosing right now

533
00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:44.240
and it's not bad for you.
They say it's actually kind of good for you,

534
00:32:44.241 --> 00:32:48.590
but Ron White's doing it.
But on white microdose is a silicide man every day.

535
00:32:48.850 --> 00:32:51.230
He has never felt better in my life.

536
00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:55.460
And they like to talk when they're microdosing especially.
So Simon,

537
00:32:55.850 --> 00:32:58.310
you just have these ideas.
That's the thing.

538
00:32:58.311 --> 00:33:02.300
You have ideas in your mind becomes open to shit that normally,
you know,

539
00:33:02.301 --> 00:33:06.420
you're closed off to obviously,
you know.
Yeah.
But you know,

540
00:33:06.530 --> 00:33:08.540
I think they think that the earth is a disk.

541
00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:11.990
I think that's what I've heard recently.
They think it's a disk,
a disk.

542
00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:16.280
I'm sort of a floating disk and then we live in the firm admin or something like

543
00:33:16.281 --> 00:33:16.431
that.

544
00:33:16.431 --> 00:33:20.210
It was like some sort of a cover over the top of the desk and that's what the,

545
00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:22.560
here it is.
What does this Jamie,
it's the cruise,

546
00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:27.320
the cruise next year that the floods loose.
Yeah.
Oh my God.

547
00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:28.930
Is that the venture yet?

548
00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:31.370
They're going to get to the fucking glaciers and they're gonna be word told you

549
00:33:31.371 --> 00:33:33.690
the wool,
the flat earth through help.

550
00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:35.780
They jump out and get eaten by a polar bear.

551
00:33:35.781 --> 00:33:40.340
That's the funniest shit has to use gps to get around.

552
00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:43.460
So I mean,
you know,

553
00:33:43.461 --> 00:33:46.850
how many scientists do they have on their side?
Oh,
all of them.

554
00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:52.950
That's the funniest shit.
No,
it's fucking ridiculous.
There's,
there's,

555
00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:57.710
there's gigantic satellites that take huge high resolution photos of the earth.

556
00:33:57.711 --> 00:34:02.440
Every 10 seconds orbit from thousands of miles out.
Those are doctored.
Yeah.

557
00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:06.020
It's just the whole thing is so fucking stupid of all the shit to believe in,

558
00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:08.360
to invest any energy in that.

559
00:34:08.390 --> 00:34:11.000
Like why would someone lie about the shape of the earth?

560
00:34:11.001 --> 00:34:14.410
That's the dumbest part about it.
You want to know what I think is,
is,
um,

561
00:34:14.450 --> 00:34:19.450
before the Internet and all these different platforms where you can get

562
00:34:19.881 --> 00:34:22.070
information,
they,
you know,

563
00:34:22.130 --> 00:34:27.020
our government and other governments could debunk any information on Ufos,

564
00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:28.460
anything.
Because they,
you know,

565
00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:32.410
there wasn't like the wide communication that did exist now.
Right.

566
00:34:32.930 --> 00:34:37.930
So I think now they put in people who are saying this crazy,

567
00:34:38.301 --> 00:34:40.880
wild way out shit so that people are,

568
00:34:40.910 --> 00:34:43.970
that are really trying to expose truth on certain things.

569
00:34:44.330 --> 00:34:49.330
They get looked at as whack jobs like the rest of those that are trying to say,

570
00:34:49.491 --> 00:34:53.570
oh,
well,
flat earth,
or we're on a disk or we're in a globe,
or blah,
blah,
blah.

571
00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:56.720
You know,
I've been spying on you.
They'll throw all that together.

572
00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:00.080
It is spying on you.
If they are,
that is for sure.
I mean,

573
00:35:00.081 --> 00:35:02.630
they really are that it's,
it's,
you know,

574
00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:06.950
since George Bush Jr was president,
they've been listening to our phone calls.

575
00:35:06.951 --> 00:35:08.850
I mean,
that's a fact.
I mean,
that was one of the,

576
00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:11.480
the things they enacted with the homeland security,

577
00:35:11.481 --> 00:35:16.310
that they can record every American's call and,
you know,

578
00:35:16.311 --> 00:35:20.330
whatever conversation mentioned certain key words as we were saying earlier,

579
00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:21.860
they would,
you know,

580
00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:25.280
they would get shuffled off to a certain department and those guys were red

581
00:35:25.281 --> 00:35:28.730
flagged and looked at and that still happens today still to this day.

582
00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:32.060
You don't need a warrant.
They can just listen.
I mean,
I'll tell you this,
right?

583
00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:37.010
There was a,
I've been traveling what,
20,
20 some odd years at,
at this

584
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:39.840
<v 1>where,
um,
when I,</v>

585
00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:44.580
when I was coming back into to the United States for a long time,

586
00:35:44.581 --> 00:35:48.480
I would not get randomly checked or anything like that.

587
00:35:48.481 --> 00:35:53.481
They just let us go by and I made a few posts somewhere,

588
00:35:55.170 --> 00:35:58.560
you know,
with an abundant amount of cannabis.
Right.

589
00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:01.080
And right after that post,

590
00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:04.170
each time I came back into the United States,

591
00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:08.520
they send me into secondary for a search.
And I started asking like,
Hey,

592
00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:12.690
I've been traveling for x amount of years.
Now every,

593
00:36:12.691 --> 00:36:17.691
I've noticed that the last four times that have come back from another country,

594
00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:20.660
you guys are randomly,
you know,

595
00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:24.480
checking my bags now what's the deal in my red flag?

596
00:36:24.481 --> 00:36:28.680
What's going on with my passport?
Um,
well,
you know,

597
00:36:28.681 --> 00:36:31.290
we're not really allowed to tell you this,
but I mean,

598
00:36:31.291 --> 00:36:35.310
have you been with kind of postings have you made on your social networks?

599
00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:39.780
Really?
Yeah.
And I said,
okay,
say no more in our annuity.
It was,

600
00:36:39.781 --> 00:36:44.580
cause I had put like,
you know,
a post with like four or five,

601
00:36:44.581 --> 00:36:45.540
six pounds in it.

602
00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:51.470
What is five pounds of weed even like,
like

603
00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:58.050
giant pillows.
Yeah.
So,
you know,
right then and there I knew,
you know,

604
00:36:58.051 --> 00:37:02.430
from that reaction that he had,
did anybody with any sort of,
um,

605
00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:06.000
that's involved in entertainment,
music,
athlete,
you know,

606
00:37:06.001 --> 00:37:10.680
whatever actor,
actress,
they're watching all of our shit.

607
00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:12.930
Oh for sure they're listening and they're watching.

608
00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:18.450
So someone like you who's been at the forefront of pushing cannabis legalization

609
00:37:18.451 --> 00:37:21.450
and always talked about it openly,
flagrantly,

610
00:37:21.451 --> 00:37:25.960
even when it was a schedule one substance.
So yeah.
Everywhere,
you know.

611
00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:30.840
Yeah.
Did you get a medical card with here the year that it was available?

612
00:37:31.650 --> 00:37:34.840
The first year it was available.
Was that like 95 or something?

613
00:37:34.841 --> 00:37:39.120
94 they had got my from,
from doctor Idleman,
he was like one of the,

614
00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:43.950
and hooked me up.
I don't have brothers.
All right.
A lot of us,

615
00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:48.770
I used to go to him even when it was way more expensive cause I'm like,
oh gee,

616
00:37:48.810 --> 00:37:52.080
yeah a bro.
He like he told me,
he goes,
my God,

617
00:37:52.650 --> 00:37:56.630
cause cause I lost track of him for a minute,
you know.
And,
uh,

618
00:37:56.640 --> 00:38:00.060
when I went back to get a renewal some years back and he's like,

619
00:38:01.010 --> 00:38:05.760
Louis,
you've,
you've been with me a long time.
I mean,
is it what it looks like?

620
00:38:05.761 --> 00:38:07.800
Is that your patient number four

621
00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:13.830
number four on his first cause he keeps a list of all his patients,
I guess.

622
00:38:13.831 --> 00:38:17.580
You know,
and apparently I was number four.
Yeah.

623
00:38:17.581 --> 00:38:18.810
Even though there was doctors out here,

624
00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:22.120
I'd always go travel to see him in Hollywood just out of respect.
And uh,

625
00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:26.970
he always had these,
he had like,
Oh gee stoners in the waiting room.
Oh yes.

626
00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:30.770
People that were just like barely holding on to reality.
Oh yeah.
He had,

627
00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:34.100
he had all sorts,
he had the hippies.
He had the new,
new,

628
00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:36.960
new Jen's hip hop people.

629
00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:41.020
I had vitamin DRIPS and shit to all kinds of weird stuff in his office.
He would,

630
00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:44.200
yeah,
he would try to sell you on some,
some different technology.

631
00:38:44.201 --> 00:38:47.390
Anytime we can use this'll help you stop smoking cigarettes.
Well,

632
00:38:47.391 --> 00:38:51.560
I don't smoke cigarettes.
He had like a thing you put on your ear trickle thing.

633
00:38:51.561 --> 00:38:56.490
The electrode.
Yeah.
They gave one to red band.
It didn't work.
Yeah.

634
00:38:56.980 --> 00:39:00.400
You know,
you got to try something,
right?
Yeah.
It was like a battery power thing.

635
00:39:00.401 --> 00:39:00.581
Right.

636
00:39:00.581 --> 00:39:03.520
I'd give a little charge to your ear that somehow knows supposed to stop you

637
00:39:03.521 --> 00:39:06.970
from smoking cigarettes.
Like,
yeah,
I didn't get,
I didn't smoke cigarettes,

638
00:39:06.971 --> 00:39:09.130
so it was like,
Eh,
I don't smoke cigarettes.

639
00:39:09.131 --> 00:39:12.460
Did you ever get your lungs checked out from all those years of weed smoking?

640
00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:16.660
Yeah,
I mean,
I,
you know,
I get physicals and stuff like that and uh,
you know,

641
00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:20.110
occasionally I'll have my lungs checked and they tell me they're great.

642
00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:24.910
Isn't that amazing?
It's crazy,
you know,
because I think if you keep active,

643
00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:29.560
you know,
like you train and,
and,
and,
uh,
a lot of us trained now,

644
00:39:29.561 --> 00:39:32.260
like this generation,
they're not like lazy stoners.

645
00:39:32.261 --> 00:39:37.060
They don't just sit back and do nothing.
There still are those.
But you know,

646
00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:41.350
I don't think it has the same carcinogens is,
you know,

647
00:39:41.351 --> 00:39:45.880
people expect it,
you know,
like cigarette.
It does.
And so,
you know,

648
00:39:45.881 --> 00:39:49.870
you might look at someone's lungs who,
who,
who smoked cigarettes and,

649
00:39:49.871 --> 00:39:52.060
and you might see something,
they're like,
hey,

650
00:39:52.061 --> 00:39:54.880
you need to slow the fuck down over here.
But in,

651
00:39:55.050 --> 00:39:58.660
in every time that I've had my lungs checked or whatever,
for whatever,

652
00:39:58.661 --> 00:40:01.870
whether I've,
you know,
gotten sick or whatever,

653
00:40:02.610 --> 00:40:04.900
they're always telling me lungs,
they're in good shape.

654
00:40:04.901 --> 00:40:08.710
And it's a funny thing because,
you know,
and they can,

655
00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:11.790
1987,
you know,

656
00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:14.410
I was 17 and I was gang banging,

657
00:40:15.250 --> 00:40:17.170
I got shot and you know,

658
00:40:17.350 --> 00:40:22.350
that I got hit by a 22 and it is hollow points do it.

659
00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:27.400
Um,
it,
it broke into three,
three pieces,
the hollow point.

660
00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:31.510
And one of them pro punctured my lung on my left side.

661
00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:36.160
And uh,
you know,
they were telling me,
well,
you know,
um,
do you smoke?

662
00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:40.960
No,
I don't really smoke cause I didn't smoke cigarettes.
I smoked weed,

663
00:40:40.961 --> 00:40:45.790
but I wasn't going to divulge that at the time.
I was 17 and you know,

664
00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:48.950
and uh,
they said,
well,
you know,

665
00:40:48.970 --> 00:40:52.170
well that's good because you'll never smoke again.
It was like you'd do,

666
00:40:52.410 --> 00:40:54.310
they punctured her lung and blah,
blah,
blah.

667
00:40:55.150 --> 00:40:59.200
They thought I was going to have to work off one lung,
but in the three days,

668
00:40:59.230 --> 00:40:59.470
you know,

669
00:40:59.470 --> 00:41:03.460
they were able to get the blood out of the lung and I was able to get it back,

670
00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:06.640
you know,
through the exercises they told me,
you know,

671
00:41:06.641 --> 00:41:11.320
to get it back to its regular size and I've never had a problem since then.

672
00:41:11.321 --> 00:41:14.830
Knock on wood,
the piece of metal out.
No,
I still got the three pieces.

673
00:41:14.831 --> 00:41:18.220
That's like when I go do my physicals and they do the,
you know,
the Mri,

674
00:41:18.310 --> 00:41:21.320
the Mris and the x rays and all that.
The doctors,
you know,

675
00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:25.420
sometimes they forget because they see so many patients.
Mr Freeze,

676
00:41:26.830 --> 00:41:30.910
these appeared to be bullet fragments with,

677
00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:34.280
what is that?
Well,
you just said it,
doctor,
bullet,

678
00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:39.080
<v 0>frack.
You've seen him a dozen times,
you know,
and uh,</v>

679
00:41:39.110 --> 00:41:43.400
yeah,
I was very lucky.
I was very lucky because,
you know,
punctured my lung.

680
00:41:43.401 --> 00:41:46.850
And then two of the pieces,
one was by the heart and one was by my spine,

681
00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:51.800
but I was at a Martin Luther King Hospital in Linwood.

682
00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:56.150
And we call that place killer king because you go in there for something small

683
00:41:56.151 --> 00:42:00.530
and ended up dying or come out,
you know,
get out or something.
So you know,

684
00:42:00.531 --> 00:42:05.531
I wasn't going to allow them to try and get to those bullets or those fragments

685
00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:08.720
to open you up.
Yeah,
no,
no,
no.
Cause you know,

686
00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:11.510
they didn't have a great success rate.

687
00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:15.410
What kind of lung exercises they give you pumped your lungs,

688
00:42:15.411 --> 00:42:19.040
but they give you this breathing apparatus that has like a ball in it,
right?

689
00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:23.360
And it has two lines and you know,
it's the first line you're trying to,

690
00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:28.130
they're telling you every day for five minutes,
10 minutes to blow that,

691
00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:30.290
you know,
not all in one shot,

692
00:42:30.291 --> 00:42:35.291
but like to keep practicing getting the ball up there and that will help inflate

693
00:42:35.421 --> 00:42:39.050
the lung and get it back.
So I had to do that for probably like three weeks.

694
00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:41.720
And uh,
you know,

695
00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:46.130
in the puncture wound it healed itself pretty much.
And,
uh,

696
00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:50.990
and the pieces are still in your lungs?
Not In the lung.
It went passed along.

697
00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:54.010
It did shot passed along.
So,
you know,
it's uh,

698
00:42:54.350 --> 00:42:58.070
I got a piece up here and one off to the side in the back.

699
00:42:58.130 --> 00:43:02.180
Well when it's really cold due to the,
the,
the nerve damage,

700
00:43:02.210 --> 00:43:07.190
I'll get like stinging like you know,
like when your,
when your hand falls asleep,

701
00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:10.760
the little needles that,
I'll get that here and then,

702
00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:13.250
and then back here where it entered,
they had to,

703
00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:18.280
they had to cut right in between a rib here to stick the tube in to put the hose

704
00:43:18.921 --> 00:43:23.870
into the lung to get the blood out of the lump.
Damn.
Yeah.
As you know,

705
00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:27.080
I was living crazy before I got into the music.

706
00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:29.960
The music saved my life pretty much.
Really?
Yeah.

707
00:43:30.050 --> 00:43:34.880
How long were you gang banging for?
For,
for some years.
You know,
I started,

708
00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:39.940
I started young,
I was probably 13 years old.
Whoa.

709
00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:44.000
Banging and,
and,
uh,
I got out of it probably,

710
00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:45.770
I didn't necessarily get out,

711
00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:50.840
but I changed up what I was doing because you don't ever really get out per se

712
00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:53.930
unless they jump you out and,
you know,

713
00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:58.430
I was to intuit to,
to be jumped out like that.

714
00:43:58.470 --> 00:44:02.090
You know what I mean?
That wasn't something I was going to do because,
you know,

715
00:44:02.091 --> 00:44:06.050
for as negative as it was,
it taught me a lot.
Um,

716
00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:11.060
so my,
my boys that I,
you know,
ran with,

717
00:44:11.061 --> 00:44:13.790
they understood I was trying to do something different.
You know,

718
00:44:13.850 --> 00:44:17.260
I made a choice to try the music and,

719
00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:20.840
and leave that shit alone because there,
there was no way that you do both.

720
00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:24.260
If you do both,
you see the results of that.

721
00:44:24.261 --> 00:44:26.600
What's happening today with a lot of cats,
you know what I mean?

722
00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:30.200
They tried to ride the line,
be professional and be in the music,

723
00:44:30.201 --> 00:44:34.020
but they're still kind of in this world over here.
And when it bleeds in,

724
00:44:34.110 --> 00:44:38.940
one bleeds into the other,
it,
you know,
it fucks everything up,
you know?
And,
uh,

725
00:44:39.330 --> 00:44:41.160
so I chose,
you know,

726
00:44:41.161 --> 00:44:45.020
I was going to do music and just talk about those life experiences and whatnot.

727
00:44:45.090 --> 00:44:50.090
And that was probably at I'm 18 that a,

728
00:44:50.221 --> 00:44:54.870
I started taking on the music and,
uh,
that's,
that's where it went.
You know,

729
00:44:54.990 --> 00:44:57.420
like when you said you learned a lot from it,
like what did you learn from it?

730
00:44:57.840 --> 00:45:00.450
Well,
you know,
your street,
you know,
there's,

731
00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:03.540
there's common sense and then there's common sense on the streets and then

732
00:45:03.541 --> 00:45:06.630
there's being aware and looking out and you know,

733
00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:11.110
not being a doormat and,
uh,
just it's,

734
00:45:11.130 --> 00:45:14.490
it's a whole different type of schooling when you're gang banging,
you know,

735
00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:18.030
that's the way you carry yourself,

736
00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:22.920
the way you communicate with someone and know whether they're disrespecting you

737
00:45:22.921 --> 00:45:27.270
or not and how you deal with that disrespect,
which is,
you know,

738
00:45:27.271 --> 00:45:31.110
a whole different world in the gang bang shit.
But it's a,

739
00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:35.850
it's a different kind of education.
You know,
I wouldn't,
I wouldn't take it back.

740
00:45:35.851 --> 00:45:37.320
Some of the things I would,
you know,

741
00:45:37.350 --> 00:45:41.310
I definitely regretted while I was doing it for sure.
But,
um,

742
00:45:41.730 --> 00:45:46.560
it made me see things from,
from a different perspective,
you know,
and,
and why,

743
00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:51.560
you know,
things are the way they are in gangs and stuff like that from lack,

744
00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:56.130
lack of opportunities,
you know,
for,
for these kids to be doing something,

745
00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:59.310
you know,
cause not everybody's good at sports,
you know,

746
00:45:59.311 --> 00:46:04.311
but there has to be other opportunities other than other than that to get kids

747
00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:09.260
interested in doing something else because falling into the gangs,
it's,

748
00:46:09.261 --> 00:46:11.970
it's easy if you don't have a good home life at home.

749
00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:17.940
The guys on the street are your second family and they eventually become your

750
00:46:17.941 --> 00:46:22.020
first family.
You know what I mean?
And if you don't have a father figure at home,

751
00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:25.890
one of the guys in the gang,
you know,
becomes your mentor,

752
00:46:25.891 --> 00:46:30.570
he could become like the guy you look up to as like your father figure.
You know,

753
00:46:30.690 --> 00:46:34.140
there's that.
And then,
you know,
again,

754
00:46:34.170 --> 00:46:39.170
there's not enough programs out there to keep people into doing something

755
00:46:39.181 --> 00:46:42.840
different than falling into that.
And then sometimes,
you know,
it just,

756
00:46:42.841 --> 00:46:46.440
it's a matter of,
you know,
you growing up in this neighborhood,

757
00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:49.980
if you have to walk down that street and they approach you and say,
Hey,

758
00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:53.340
you live in this hood,
you got to be with us.
If you don't,

759
00:46:53.341 --> 00:46:54.540
we're going to make it hard for you.

760
00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:59.010
So there's that peer pressure and then there's the legacy shit.
Like,

761
00:46:59.011 --> 00:47:02.670
so of my father was a gangster in this gang and he still lives in this

762
00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:03.653
neighborhood.

763
00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:09.030
Pressure's on for me eventually to take up where father left off,

764
00:47:09.690 --> 00:47:11.880
you know?
And uh,
it's,

765
00:47:11.881 --> 00:47:14.940
it's all those things and that some people just start thrill seekers and they

766
00:47:14.941 --> 00:47:19.020
choose it and have nothing,
you know,
in common with none of that.

767
00:47:19.021 --> 00:47:21.020
They just choose it for some people too.

768
00:47:21.021 --> 00:47:24.320
It's so appealing to have somewhere that you belong right in.

769
00:47:24.370 --> 00:47:25.200
And that's the thing,

770
00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:29.620
because if you don't feel like you belong in your school or you don't with your

771
00:47:29.621 --> 00:47:32.200
in your family and,
and that,

772
00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:36.670
that she can totally take hold in,
in,
you end up there.
You know,

773
00:47:36.671 --> 00:47:40.900
fortunately I had good friends that weren't gang bangers.
You know,

774
00:47:40.901 --> 00:47:45.430
that they had talent for music,
which is mugs and sin.
And since brother mellow,

775
00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:49.360
you know,
they were,
you know,
I did music as a hobby,
you know,

776
00:47:49.361 --> 00:47:53.050
before I got into gangs and they got me back into the music.

777
00:47:53.051 --> 00:47:56.470
They cause they recognize something in me and said,
hey,

778
00:47:56.500 --> 00:48:00.120
we want you to come back where we got these opportunities over here.

779
00:48:00.130 --> 00:48:03.820
Come join us.
Did you always have that style?
No,
I didn't.

780
00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:08.830
One that you developed that once we started working on our Cypress Hill Demos,

781
00:48:09.340 --> 00:48:11.800
um,
mugs came to me and said,
hey man,

782
00:48:11.801 --> 00:48:14.080
you gotta do something gotta do something different.

783
00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:17.470
Otherwise you're going to write for sin.
Because sin had a good voice.

784
00:48:17.471 --> 00:48:22.471
His shit was locked in my voice as wrapping in a voice similar to the one and

785
00:48:22.530 --> 00:48:25.960
talking and all of the rhymes were good.

786
00:48:26.590 --> 00:48:30.190
It didn't cut through on the style,
like on,
on,
you know,
on the beats.

787
00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:33.970
It just sounded like,
you know,
some regular shit.
So,
you know,

788
00:48:33.971 --> 00:48:37.510
I didn't want to be someone's writer,
you know,
I wanted to write for myself.

789
00:48:37.511 --> 00:48:41.820
So you know,
there was a guy that we used to listen to,
um,

790
00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:43.960
coming up was name is Ram Lz.

791
00:48:44.110 --> 00:48:47.620
He was on this a record called wild style and he was in the movie,

792
00:48:47.621 --> 00:48:51.490
he was this rapper who is very obscure,

793
00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:53.680
but he was a artist too,
you know,

794
00:48:53.681 --> 00:48:57.640
like a graffiti artists but then also an artist artist,
you know,

795
00:48:57.641 --> 00:49:01.630
but he was also a rapper and when he would do is he'd wrap into regular style,

796
00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:05.700
like his talking voice.
This is the brother they called the rebel.

797
00:49:05.710 --> 00:49:10.330
He had a deep voice like that and then he would flip right in the middle,

798
00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:15.610
take it up town to Cypress Hill with the shot gun,
Baba like that.

799
00:49:15.611 --> 00:49:19.360
And you know,
we were always freaking out on it yet two styles.

800
00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:24.900
So I tried throwing my voice in that sort of similar style and it ended up

801
00:49:26.231 --> 00:49:30.010
sticking.
I didn't really like,
I didn't think anybody was going to like it.

802
00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:32.680
I thought they were going to be like,
get the fuck Outta here with that.

803
00:49:33.250 --> 00:49:36.890
But they ended up liking it.
And,
uh,
I think the first song that,
um,

804
00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:42.160
came about in that style was the song real estate off our first album.

805
00:49:42.161 --> 00:49:46.810
It's a,
you know,
that was where I tried it the first time.

806
00:49:46.811 --> 00:49:47.441
They liked it.

807
00:49:47.441 --> 00:49:51.970
So then kill a man came next to [inaudible] that song and that style then hand

808
00:49:51.971 --> 00:49:55.120
on the pump and it just became a flow after that.

809
00:49:55.450 --> 00:49:58.750
And I really did not feel it at first.
I was like,
fuck,

810
00:49:58.751 --> 00:50:03.580
I can't believe they got me rapping in this voice.
And it,
it took,

811
00:50:03.730 --> 00:50:06.400
it took a minute to get used to that,
you know,

812
00:50:06.401 --> 00:50:11.110
like doing it live because,
you know,
I had a tendency as,
as rappers,

813
00:50:11.111 --> 00:50:11.411
you know,

814
00:50:11.411 --> 00:50:14.800
that don't know because there's no school for this unless you have somebody

815
00:50:14.801 --> 00:50:18.130
who's done it and they teach you,
okay,
this is what the get down is.

816
00:50:18.131 --> 00:50:22.330
And we didn't have that really.
It was all hands on learning.
I,
you know,

817
00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:26.740
for the first few years of man,
I was trying to do the voice and I'd ended up,

818
00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:27.321
you know,

819
00:50:27.321 --> 00:50:30.950
getting over hyped because the crowd is hyping that start yelling the versus

820
00:50:30.951 --> 00:50:35.300
instead of like wrapping them,
like on the record I'd throw my voice out,

821
00:50:35.301 --> 00:50:38.360
my voice would get scratchy,
I'd be sounded like Busta rhymes and shit.

822
00:50:38.390 --> 00:50:39.223
You know what I mean?

823
00:50:39.830 --> 00:50:44.830
And it took me five years to actually harness how to actually do the shows with

824
00:50:45.771 --> 00:50:49.190
this voice.
And I had to go to this opera singer,
um,

825
00:50:49.370 --> 00:50:54.200
coach really the name was something Elizabeth Sabine or something like that.

826
00:50:54.201 --> 00:50:57.500
She trained a lot of folks but she,
she,
she,

827
00:50:57.560 --> 00:51:00.860
her shit was like to teach you the operatic way of,
of singing,

828
00:51:00.861 --> 00:51:05.000
which is from the diaphragm,
tightened the stomach,
take little breaths.

829
00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:08.750
But those little breaths make your lungs expand,
you know,

830
00:51:08.751 --> 00:51:13.190
a lot and it's less projection from your throat and more from the bottom.

831
00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:17.990
And she taught me that technique and I never went horse again after that.

832
00:51:17.991 --> 00:51:22.760
I like with,
you know,
people often compliment me on,
you know,

833
00:51:22.761 --> 00:51:24.950
sounding so close to how the records are.

834
00:51:24.951 --> 00:51:29.030
There's once in a while where I might get excited and start saying it louder

835
00:51:29.031 --> 00:51:33.480
than it might be,
but I'm always sorta right there and I got it.
You know,

836
00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:36.650
I got to give all props to her because if she hadn't showed me that technique,

837
00:51:36.651 --> 00:51:40.220
I'd probably still be yelling and screaming my shit out,

838
00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:42.290
locking up my voice.
You know,

839
00:51:42.291 --> 00:51:46.700
that brings up an interesting point is this her metal right here.

840
00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:49.910
Wait,
let me hear some cold.
We can't play this on youtube.
We'll get kicked off.

841
00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:52.700
And she was,
and she was an opera singer at one time,

842
00:51:53.390 --> 00:51:57.670
but she went on to teach people the technique.
No kid in man.

843
00:51:58.550 --> 00:52:01.780
That is why.
See,

844
00:52:01.790 --> 00:52:06.790
because if you try to keep your breath and in sustain a long note like that from

845
00:52:06.891 --> 00:52:10.610
your chest,
you won't sustain that note long enough.

846
00:52:10.611 --> 00:52:14.640
But if you tight now from your diaphragm,
yeah.
If you tighten up almost,

847
00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:17.300
it's almost like if you're going to take a shit

848
00:52:23.810 --> 00:52:25.460
<v 2>oh,</v>

849
00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:29.630
<v 0>instead of from the throat.
That makes sense.
Yeah.
You know,
like it,
it allows you,</v>

850
00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:34.820
it allows your lungs to expand while you're breathing from your diaphragm.

851
00:52:35.090 --> 00:52:38.500
So that's what she taught a lot of singers.
And it's a,

852
00:52:38.540 --> 00:52:43.250
another method is to cheat the word,
like pronounce it,
you know,

853
00:52:43.251 --> 00:52:44.570
like you're kind of like,
it's,

854
00:52:44.571 --> 00:52:48.050
it's like what these mumble rappers do when they pronounce a word and they kind

855
00:52:48.051 --> 00:52:51.230
of mumble it and the sort of cheat it,
you know what the word is,

856
00:52:51.231 --> 00:52:55.220
but they didn't pronounce it all the way.
So,

857
00:52:55.221 --> 00:52:58.880
so in other words,
if she's going to you,
we're going to sing the line,
come,

858
00:52:58.881 --> 00:53:03.680
he come with me.
So it sounds a little bit cleaner.
You'd say gum with me,

859
00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:07.640
but in the way you would say it is more with a g,

860
00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:13.060
but it's so tucked in that you here come with me and it's just a cheating way of

861
00:53:14.331 --> 00:53:18.380
saying it to get the line a little bit cleaner and fucking,
uh,
you know,

862
00:53:18.381 --> 00:53:22.490
and the breath.
And she taught me all that shit.
And,
and,
and it worked for rap.

863
00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:25.640
I didn't know if it would because I mean,
it was,

864
00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:27.900
it's the sheep primarily taught singers.

865
00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:31.710
I was probably the first rapper that she taught this technique too.

866
00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:36.390
And it stuck,
man.
How'd you find her?
Um,

867
00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:40.920
what am,
what am I friends had heard of her?
You know,
because I mean,
in the,

868
00:53:40.921 --> 00:53:45.750
in the industry,
you know,
become friends with other,
you know,

869
00:53:45.751 --> 00:53:50.670
um,
your peers and stuff like that,
you know,
I knew a couple of singers and they,

870
00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:55.410
they,
they were,
you know,
noting my problem is to,
you know,

871
00:53:55.411 --> 00:54:00.180
screaming my versus in coming back with the raspy voice.
So they were like,
here,

872
00:54:00.181 --> 00:54:02.580
why don't you try this person right here?

873
00:54:03.660 --> 00:54:07.890
This person taught or,
or gave this technique to so and so.

874
00:54:07.891 --> 00:54:12.120
And it was another singer.
I can't remember.
But,
um,
I thought,
well,
you know,

875
00:54:12.121 --> 00:54:15.720
what have I got to lose?
I mean,
if it doesn't work,
it doesn't work,
but it may be,

876
00:54:15.721 --> 00:54:20.320
I learned something from it that I could use somewhere else.
Right.
And Fuck,
she,

877
00:54:20.321 --> 00:54:24.450
she taught me the warmup.
She taught me.
Uh,

878
00:54:24.870 --> 00:54:29.520
you know,
the certain words that you can cheat to,
to,
you know,

879
00:54:29.521 --> 00:54:30.354
for,

880
00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:34.350
for certain breath control purposes cause the way you pronounce certain things,

881
00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:39.150
you know,
sort of add to that and just the tightening of the diaphragm man.

882
00:54:39.151 --> 00:54:39.621
Like if,

883
00:54:39.621 --> 00:54:43.770
if I hadn't learned that it would have took me a lot longer to do the shows the

884
00:54:43.771 --> 00:54:46.770
way that I can do them now.
So do you warm up before shows?

885
00:54:47.100 --> 00:54:52.100
I don't necessarily need to like from the first song on my voice like gets in

886
00:54:52.261 --> 00:54:56.370
like the first few bars.
It,
it warms up right then and there and uh,

887
00:54:56.930 --> 00:55:00.300
it's not really like singing where I got a sustained notes and stuff like that

888
00:55:00.301 --> 00:55:02.730
so I don't have to do those same kind of warm ups.

889
00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:07.380
If I was going to sing some shit,
yes,
I would definitely have to get my,
you know,

890
00:55:07.890 --> 00:55:12.870
get the pitch right and the throat warmed up to,
to do those different,

891
00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:18.010
you know,
melodies or whatever the hell.
But fortunately I don't sing though.

892
00:55:18.250 --> 00:55:22.500
The whole rap world has always been fascinating to me.
Like how someone gets in,

893
00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:25.890
like,
how do you get started?
Are there open mics?
Like what?

894
00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:27.710
[inaudible] back in the day,
man,

895
00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:31.650
someone had to be the guy endorsing you.
You know,

896
00:55:31.651 --> 00:55:35.730
like saying to,
you know these guys over here,
Amen.
Listen to this,

897
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:39.930
these artists,
right?
Or this artist right here,
they're the new shit.

898
00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:43.710
They're going to be the one and then you would have to do a couple of showcases

899
00:55:43.711 --> 00:55:47.600
and stuff like that.
And you know,
when some people over,
I mean we,

900
00:55:47.670 --> 00:55:51.210
we definitely did our share of showcases in the beginning,

901
00:55:51.211 --> 00:55:55.530
but we were getting passed on left and right.
Because,
you know,
people thought,

902
00:55:56.070 --> 00:56:00.900
you know,
what are they talking about with this cannabis shit?
And we,

903
00:56:00.901 --> 00:56:03.720
and we didn't sound like a west coast group,
you know,

904
00:56:03.721 --> 00:56:07.500
because we were trying to sell our shit to west coast labels here and they did

905
00:56:07.501 --> 00:56:12.450
not get us.
It wasn't until,
you know,
um,
mugs had had,

906
00:56:12.540 --> 00:56:13.000
you know,

907
00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:17.340
he'd previously been in a group called [inaudible] 73 and he had worked with

908
00:56:17.341 --> 00:56:21.180
these guys called the rhyme syndicate,
which was ice teas guy.
So he kind of,

909
00:56:21.210 --> 00:56:25.270
you know,
he was the guy that people knew and then,
um,
send dogs,

910
00:56:25.271 --> 00:56:28.150
brother and mellow man,
ace eventually would get in the door.

911
00:56:29.140 --> 00:56:32.950
And so people started hearing about us through,
you know,

912
00:56:33.310 --> 00:56:38.280
through more mugs and mellow metal.
Mellow didn't really do shit for us,
you know,

913
00:56:38.281 --> 00:56:41.620
I'll,
I'll truth told,
but mugs,
you know,

914
00:56:41.621 --> 00:56:46.060
they kept hearing about a group that he was forming outside of 73,

915
00:56:46.090 --> 00:56:49.090
which came to be Cypress Hill.
And so,
you know,

916
00:56:49.091 --> 00:56:54.091
the guys that worked on him worked with him on the 73 records,

917
00:56:54.251 --> 00:56:58.260
which is Joe's Niccolo of,
of rough house records,
you know,

918
00:56:58.330 --> 00:57:01.790
he wanted to sign whatever Muggs was doing and you know,

919
00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:05.200
he eventually ended up signing us.
Um,

920
00:57:05.230 --> 00:57:09.930
and they had a distribution deal with a,
with Sony music.
So,
you know,
we,
you know,

921
00:57:09.940 --> 00:57:13.510
put out our records of rough house Columbia or roughhouse,
Sony,

922
00:57:13.511 --> 00:57:18.220
something like that.
And that's how we got put on,
you know,
and,
and again,

923
00:57:18.221 --> 00:57:21.800
it had to be word of mouth because if nobody heard it,
you heard of you.

924
00:57:21.820 --> 00:57:26.820
You had to have some really fucking dope music for them to even like consider

925
00:57:27.611 --> 00:57:31.800
you if you didn't have like someone back in you.
It was tough.
You know,

926
00:57:31.870 --> 00:57:34.630
you had to have someone come speak on your behalf and say,

927
00:57:34.660 --> 00:57:37.930
hey these guys are the new new shit.
And,
and uh,

928
00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:41.410
fortunately for us,
once we put out our snippet tape,

929
00:57:41.411 --> 00:57:45.850
like when Sony put out our snippet tape,
guys like EPMD right.

930
00:57:45.851 --> 00:57:49.210
And they were one of our favorite groups in the world,
man.

931
00:57:49.211 --> 00:57:52.780
It would the top five for Cypress others,
you know,
public enemy,

932
00:57:52.781 --> 00:57:56.740
Beastie boys EPMD fuck.
They were the shit.

933
00:57:57.280 --> 00:57:57.880
And uh,

934
00:57:57.880 --> 00:58:02.880
those were the guys that took our snippet tape and they were showing our snippet

935
00:58:03.401 --> 00:58:06.340
tape to other rappers.
Like,
hey guys,
look at these new fucking guys.

936
00:58:06.341 --> 00:58:09.440
Cause you know,
Busta rhyme told me this story you'll love,

937
00:58:09.510 --> 00:58:14.510
you'll are just shift from EPMD way back in the day they was planning for a

938
00:58:15.580 --> 00:58:20.290
public enemy and I just happened to be in the room and Wa and you know,

939
00:58:20.291 --> 00:58:23.510
ice cube when we met him for the first time,
you know,
um,

940
00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:28.240
and we had our ups and downs with him,
but he's one of my homeys.
Um,
he,

941
00:58:28.250 --> 00:58:29.230
he told me,
yeah man,

942
00:58:29.231 --> 00:58:32.950
the first time I heard of y'all was through epmt that we was on tour was doing

943
00:58:32.951 --> 00:58:36.530
the show and they came in,
which I'll tape and that's how I heard of y'all.
And,

944
00:58:36.531 --> 00:58:41.160
and you know,
they were like our first street team,
man,
fucking evil.

945
00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:45.670
Our faith,
our favorite,
one of our top three favorite groups was out there,

946
00:58:46.030 --> 00:58:50.110
like with our snippet tape telling people,
hey,
these guys are the new shit.

947
00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:54.310
And uh,
they do,
they do stuff occasionally,
but,
uh,
they,

948
00:58:54.380 --> 00:58:56.830
I think they do more work,
you know,
individually.

949
00:58:56.831 --> 00:59:00.580
Now I know Eric sermon is putting out a record right now.

950
00:59:00.581 --> 00:59:04.690
He was just promoting it on,
on some radio show.

951
00:59:05.230 --> 00:59:08.470
And,
uh,
I mean those guys still active,
stay active.

952
00:59:08.471 --> 00:59:12.700
I mean he's a producer so he's always making music.
But as a rapper,
you know,

953
00:59:12.810 --> 00:59:16.450
they don't put out as much stuff as they used to.
But yeah,
they're still active.

954
00:59:16.510 --> 00:59:21.500
You know who I Miss Kool g rap,
Kool g rap.
I still passed out a,

955
00:59:21.710 --> 00:59:25.720
a lot of guys don't have a style if he doesn't,
you know,

956
00:59:25.730 --> 00:59:30.100
if he had never come out of so many people were influenced by him.
Yeah.

957
00:59:30.380 --> 00:59:32.820
Bad motherfuckers.
A lot of people forgot about him.

958
00:59:32.860 --> 00:59:36.320
A lot of people forgot about him and he was one of the baddest dudes I'd been a

959
00:59:36.321 --> 00:59:40.670
lot of people you know,
would talk about big daddy Kane and Rakim.
Sure.

960
00:59:40.730 --> 00:59:45.620
But you couldn't talk about them without talking about Kool g rap cause he was

961
00:59:45.621 --> 00:59:49.840
like one of those guys like spitting med versus man,

962
00:59:49.841 --> 00:59:52.790
like his bar work was incredible.
He was incredible.

963
00:59:52.791 --> 00:59:54.500
I still listened to that song.
Cock blocking.

964
00:59:54.830 --> 00:59:57.590
Every now and then I'll throw that on and I gotta tell you,
you know,

965
00:59:57.591 --> 01:00:02.360
like if you hear songs that he does today,
he is still fucking current.

966
01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:07.130
Like his,
he's still got that style that that cuts through.
Like,

967
01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:09.170
you know,
some of the older artists,

968
01:00:09.210 --> 01:00:14.210
they sort of lose the style that people love and they don't know how to

969
01:00:14.721 --> 01:00:19.700
transition into,
you know,
what their style would be right now.
You know,

970
01:00:19.701 --> 01:00:23.270
like updating whatever that style is.
You know,
a lot of,

971
01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:26.510
a lot of the older artists had troubles doing that,
you know,

972
01:00:26.511 --> 01:00:30.320
but my main Kool g rap,
not a fucking street blues.

973
01:00:30.490 --> 01:00:34.760
Well he's still ill.
Tastic yeah,
yeah.

974
01:00:34.850 --> 01:00:39.150
I always got confused why he didn't get bigger.
I didn't get it.
I was like,

975
01:00:39.190 --> 01:00:41.480
he's got so good.
You know,
I think it was,

976
01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:46.340
it was just the wave that came after him.
You know,
it's,
it's,
it's like,
uh,

977
01:00:46.430 --> 01:00:51.380
he was such an underground force and if you're underground force,
you know,

978
01:00:51.381 --> 01:00:55.280
you had to make a conscious decision whether,
okay,

979
01:00:56.600 --> 01:01:01.220
I'm going to go,
man,
if I go mainstream,
I'm going to lose these hardcore fans.

980
01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:04.520
I might gain,
you know,
these mainstream fans.

981
01:01:04.521 --> 01:01:09.260
But how long are they going to stay with me as opposed to these core fans that

982
01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:12.860
you know,
that they're there.
But with his style,

983
01:01:12.861 --> 01:01:16.970
he couldn't just keep them because I thought he could.
I think guys kept him.

984
01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:21.620
Right.
You want to know something.
I think it was due to,
um,
you know,

985
01:01:21.621 --> 01:01:25.610
the record company not wanting to take the chance because as an artist you want

986
01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:29.660
everybody to hear your shit.
You know,
for us,
we didn't play those games.

987
01:01:29.661 --> 01:01:34.070
We said fuck it.
You know,
if,
if we felt it was the right look for us,

988
01:01:34.540 --> 01:01:38.520
we were going to take it,
you know,
no matter what anybody thought,
you know,
and,

989
01:01:38.521 --> 01:01:43.430
uh,
uh,
again,
you faced scrutiny for Shit like that,
but in the end,

990
01:01:43.460 --> 01:01:47.480
you know,
if you didn't play yourself,
people remember that,
you know,

991
01:01:47.481 --> 01:01:51.560
and we said,
fuck it.
We're going to take our music mainstream.

992
01:01:51.770 --> 01:01:53.870
Even though that was not our intent.
You know,

993
01:01:53.871 --> 01:01:57.950
we always meant ourselves to be a more underground group,
but insane.

994
01:01:57.970 --> 01:02:02.000
And the brand didn't allow that.
Uh,
it,
it,
it propelled us,
you know,

995
01:02:02.001 --> 01:02:03.080
so we were like,
okay,

996
01:02:03.081 --> 01:02:08.081
well we're going to take our underground assets up into this mainstream and show

997
01:02:08.121 --> 01:02:10.530
him how we do it.
And it,

998
01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.900
it kicked the door open for a lot of an other underground acts to go into the

999
01:02:14.910 --> 01:02:15.743
mainstream.

1000
01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:20.910
And we prove that if you do it right and if stay on your game and if you keep

1001
01:02:20.911 --> 01:02:21.870
working in,

1002
01:02:21.871 --> 01:02:26.871
in and stay present and put out quality music that you can sustain those,

1003
01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:32.250
those mainstream fas that you gain right there and the core.
Yeah.

1004
01:02:32.251 --> 01:02:37.140
You guys sustain so well that people covered your shit.
Yeah,
like rage.

1005
01:02:37.230 --> 01:02:40.560
That was awesome.
She,
when they covered pistol grip pump on my left at all times.

1006
01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:45.020
Holy Shit.
One of my favorite bands,
still a roach,
a yell that,
that,

1007
01:02:45.021 --> 01:02:46.140
that shit was awesome.

1008
01:02:46.170 --> 01:02:51.170
I mean he took a totally different take on it but like a cover.

1009
01:02:51.390 --> 01:02:55.020
But it was,
it was a cover but it was his take.
Yeah,
it was bad at it.

1010
01:02:55.030 --> 01:02:56.640
It was one of my favorites,
man.
You know,

1011
01:02:56.641 --> 01:02:58.860
and it was a honor to me because you know,

1012
01:02:58.861 --> 01:03:02.010
like I was really good friends with them to begin with.

1013
01:03:02.610 --> 01:03:07.290
I saw them come out the gate before they exploded and became rage against the

1014
01:03:07.291 --> 01:03:11.700
machine.
And so for them to cover,
one of our songs were like,
man,

1015
01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:16.110
fuck yeah.
You know,
because they,
they,
they helped us get better.

1016
01:03:16.650 --> 01:03:16.861
You know,

1017
01:03:16.861 --> 01:03:20.280
there was a lot of groups that we look to influence even if they were doing

1018
01:03:20.281 --> 01:03:23.370
different style of music,
like public enemy wasn't influenced to us.

1019
01:03:23.371 --> 01:03:28.350
Rage against the machine was an inspiration to us to like push the envelope a

1020
01:03:28.351 --> 01:03:30.060
little bit more on what we were doing.

1021
01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:34.170
Not necessarily like how they were because they had their own sound just like we

1022
01:03:34.171 --> 01:03:37.710
had our own sound.
So they made us push,
you know,

1023
01:03:37.711 --> 01:03:39.270
in groups like that made us better.

1024
01:03:39.271 --> 01:03:43.380
So when we heard this guy fucking doing or this Ben doing the cover and then

1025
01:03:43.381 --> 01:03:46.580
they asked us to come play this song,
which,

1026
01:03:47.070 --> 01:03:50.640
which would be their last night as rage against the machine for a long time.

1027
01:03:50.641 --> 01:03:55.100
This was like their last show right here.
We got to do that with them and I must,

1028
01:03:55.101 --> 01:03:58.380
must've been amazing.
And I was wearing a dad hat before,
dad hats were cool.

1029
01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:02.160
I will not wear one right now,

1030
01:04:02.650 --> 01:04:06.910
however I know what I was thinking.
But fuck it.
I'm there.
Yes.

1031
01:04:07.450 --> 01:04:10.620
Areas.
It was a fun show,
man.
I went into the mosh pit,

1032
01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:14.550
but Israel before that song,
before they called us up for that song,

1033
01:04:14.551 --> 01:04:19.520
for most of their set,
I was in the mosh pit and there was you,
you,
USC,
uh,

1034
01:04:20.010 --> 01:04:24.990
front lineman down their record shop,
Bro.
How's it in there with them?

1035
01:04:25.230 --> 01:04:29.340
They were protected me.
I was like,
Oh shit.
Be Real.
You're up in that.

1036
01:04:29.370 --> 01:04:31.860
We're working.
Shopped together.
It was,
it was awesome.

1037
01:04:31.890 --> 01:04:34.170
This is a video of Dana white in a mosh pit once.

1038
01:04:34.530 --> 01:04:36.850
I don't know what the fuck he was thinking.
He must have been drunk.

1039
01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:41.100
He jumped in the mosh pit like years ago.
He's a big dude though.
He's a big dude.

1040
01:04:41.101 --> 01:04:44.520
He's jumping around their motion around.
Yeah.
I dated a girl,

1041
01:04:44.521 --> 01:04:48.840
got Kale in a mosh pit once a man.
It's crazy,
man.

1042
01:04:48.870 --> 01:04:52.620
I used to go into a lot of different mosh pits are there.
He's in the rage mush,

1043
01:04:52.621 --> 01:04:54.720
but the rates of it is safe.

1044
01:04:54.721 --> 01:04:57.910
But every now and then you're running into a dick head.
I'll tell you man,

1045
01:04:58.860 --> 01:05:02.010
the craziest mosh pits,
you know,
that I saw,

1046
01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:06.840
well the craziest mosh pits I've gotten into,
there was a limp biscuit mosh pit.

1047
01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:11.100
That was crazy.
And,
but the craziest was was the rage mosh pit.

1048
01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:16.470
But the ones that I seen from outside of it not being in it that were crazy was

1049
01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:18.250
there was a sound garden mosh pit.

1050
01:05:18.710 --> 01:05:22.750
<v 1>The next zoom garden.
Yeah.
At,
at Lollapalooza early on it was,
uh,</v>

1051
01:05:23.050 --> 01:05:26.140
when they had bad motor finger out.
Oh Man.

1052
01:05:26.260 --> 01:05:30.550
That fucking mosh pit was like,
oh,
whirlpool of chaos bro.

1053
01:05:31.330 --> 01:05:34.540
I was loving it.
And that was on mushrooms watching this shit.

1054
01:05:34.541 --> 01:05:39.200
So it was fucking amazing.
And uh,
then,
uh,

1055
01:05:39.250 --> 01:05:43.120
and then a slayer mosh pit man,
they're fucking shit is brutal.
Yeah,

1056
01:05:43.121 --> 01:05:47.080
that sounds like just the pace of slayer.
It's crazy.
But I got to tell you,

1057
01:05:47.081 --> 01:05:50.080
since joining profits of rage in us,
you know,

1058
01:05:50.081 --> 01:05:54.700
when we tour Europe and stuff like that,
and we do a combination of,
you know,
uh,

1059
01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:58.530
rage against the machine songs,
public enemy and Cypress Hill,
along with our,

1060
01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:03.210
our own material.
The mosh pits are fucking crazy,
man.

1061
01:06:03.730 --> 01:06:08.020
But you know,
there was one,
one,
one thing that I saw that was not brutal,

1062
01:06:08.110 --> 01:06:11.200
but it was cool as fuck.
And it was in,
um,
I think,

1063
01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:15.580
I believe it was Sweden or Switzerland,
but they're,
you know,

1064
01:06:15.610 --> 01:06:18.910
out of like the 60,
70,000 people that were out there,

1065
01:06:18.911 --> 01:06:23.680
there was like maybe 5,000 concentrated people who sat down on their ass.

1066
01:06:23.681 --> 01:06:27.970
Right.
And we're like,
the fuck are these people doing aren't like,

1067
01:06:27.971 --> 01:06:30.940
are they protesting?
Are Separate.
Fuck is going on.
Right.

1068
01:06:31.690 --> 01:06:36.100
And what was crazy as you know,
you're not going to stop playing.

1069
01:06:36.110 --> 01:06:39.580
You just keep going.
So we start on,
on,
um,
I believe the song was good,

1070
01:06:39.581 --> 01:06:42.130
real gorilla radio that we were planted,
that,
that point.

1071
01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:47.290
All of a sudden we see them start doing this.
The Rowan,
they were wrote,

1072
01:06:47.530 --> 01:06:51.130
it was like a viking row.
It was fucking move.

1073
01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:54.040
It was a move that the crowd was doing.
So there's five,

1074
01:06:54.460 --> 01:06:58.990
5,000 people out of the 30,000 that are sitting in,
you know,

1075
01:06:58.991 --> 01:07:03.100
like next to each other lines,
rows,
you know,

1076
01:07:03.101 --> 01:07:06.880
just fucking of people rowing on beat dog.

1077
01:07:06.910 --> 01:07:11.590
It was the fucking vikings man.

1078
01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:14.590
How crazy.
That DNA just stuck with those people.

1079
01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:18.160
And that was just the little section of it,
man.
If you were to see from stage,

1080
01:07:18.161 --> 01:07:18.994
Daryl was like,

1081
01:07:19.180 --> 01:07:24.010
it was spot like spotted groups and they sat down and they sat down and were

1082
01:07:24.011 --> 01:07:28.420
rowing
so fucking crazy.
Yeah.

1083
01:07:28.690 --> 01:07:30.040
Have you ever seen the,
there was a,

1084
01:07:30.041 --> 01:07:34.300
they did a viking chant once at a soccer game.
Crazy.
Aw Man.

1085
01:07:34.301 --> 01:07:38.040
It's wild because the whole fucking arena did it and you feel it.

1086
01:07:38.041 --> 01:07:41.020
You feel that shit.
You gotta think man,

1087
01:07:41.021 --> 01:07:44.710
when they were going to wars back in the day and they rallied all their guys up

1088
01:07:44.711 --> 01:07:48.430
just like that,
that the fucking row out of tune though.

1089
01:07:48.431 --> 01:07:52.630
This fucking bolt's going to go sideways.
You don't,
I don't,

1090
01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:57.070
I don't know where that move comes from,
but it looks cool when you seal as fuck.

1091
01:07:57.200 --> 01:07:59.250
That's gotta be an old school viking thing.
Yeah,

1092
01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:03.340
they probably do it when they get drunk.
Yeah.
I mean,
you know,
think about it.

1093
01:08:03.370 --> 01:08:07.120
You know they used to conquest motherfuckers so they're like fucking row and

1094
01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:10.030
throw it in row.
Imagine here it like,

1095
01:08:10.031 --> 01:08:14.260
see if you can find that the Viking one at a soccer game.
Cause it's like,

1096
01:08:14.261 --> 01:08:15.980
I think it's at a world or something like that.
But

1097
01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:20.540
<v 0>they like,
Ooh,
you hear it in the crowd and he's like,</v>

1098
01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:22.850
oh my God.
Imagine hearing that shit over the,

1099
01:08:22.851 --> 01:08:25.880
when they're coming to get you to cause your village like grabbed the baby.

1100
01:08:25.881 --> 01:08:29.480
We're going to live in the woods.
Fuck you.
Gotta get Outta here.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1101
01:08:29.930 --> 01:08:30.730
And those are big

1102
01:08:30.730 --> 01:08:33.360
<v 3>dudes.
Yeah,
there it is.</v>

1103
01:08:35.910 --> 01:08:40.770
Oh yeah.
Look at that dog tuned weatherman.

1104
01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:46.050
They're all insane.
Look at the hand.
That's spooky.
Yeah.

1105
01:08:46.051 --> 01:08:47.150
Met is a fuckers.

1106
01:08:47.300 --> 01:08:51.760
<v 0>Somebody reignites them.
Imagine that component is coming over the world.</v>

1107
01:08:52.060 --> 01:08:54.580
There's enough of them.
That's it.
Madison,
that Hoard Cup.

1108
01:08:54.581 --> 01:08:58.490
And that's fucking crazy line of DNA.

1109
01:08:58.700 --> 01:09:02.790
You know a line of people that just were conquerors,
sturdy motherfuckers,

1110
01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:06.360
sturdy giant motherfuckers who did mushrooms.
Yeah,
they would,

1111
01:09:06.380 --> 01:09:09.020
they would blaze up mushroom,

1112
01:09:09.021 --> 01:09:13.170
their fucking heads into oblivion and you just go slash people get them.

1113
01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:16.970
It's crazy,
man.
This is another one sitting.
Another one.

1114
01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:19.053
So that's like the

1115
01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:20.153
<v 3>Viking clip,</v>

1116
01:09:21.510 --> 01:09:25.130
I guess the NFL biking sort of adopted this recently and they do it in their

1117
01:09:25.290 --> 01:09:27.660
football game.
Yeah.
But look at that Dork with the glasses.

1118
01:09:27.690 --> 01:09:29.640
Put Your fucking hands down,
man.
Stop.

1119
01:09:31.890 --> 01:09:35.480
<v 0>That's in Brown Viking.</v>

1120
01:09:35.490 --> 01:09:38.410
The chat to figure out to beat you stopped that.
Sorry look.
He's like,

1121
01:09:38.411 --> 01:09:41.800
well are you,
she'll highlight get it.
He's a spiking.

1122
01:09:42.340 --> 01:09:44.290
So when when you first start rapping,

1123
01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:49.500
like you wrapped them with kids in your neighborhood or you like aspiring to be

1124
01:09:49.571 --> 01:09:52.390
a rapper and writing shit down and try and things on your friends.

1125
01:09:52.391 --> 01:09:56.470
Like how do you get started?
Well,
the way that I started,
I was writing,
you know,

1126
01:09:56.550 --> 01:10:00.910
like poetry first.
Really?
Yeah.
What kind of poetry?
Just like,
you know,

1127
01:10:01.300 --> 01:10:04.210
like hoods,
stuff,
you know,
just stuff that rhymed.

1128
01:10:04.211 --> 01:10:09.130
But like just sort of writing it down.
Like it was a,

1129
01:10:09.131 --> 01:10:11.830
it was almost like writing raps,
but it just,
you know,

1130
01:10:12.250 --> 01:10:16.390
it's without saying it right,
because you read it and shit like that,
whatever.

1131
01:10:16.391 --> 01:10:20.920
But I would just write poetry about,
you know,
everyday shit.

1132
01:10:21.190 --> 01:10:25.690
You know what I mean?
Nothing,
you know.
It wasn't like doing like the,

1133
01:10:26.110 --> 01:10:29.960
I don't know if there's like categories of poetry,
but it,
you know,

1134
01:10:30.130 --> 01:10:34.690
it was just stuff that that would happen from day to day,
you know,
and uh,

1135
01:10:35.380 --> 01:10:38.980
I had a knack for writing and I realize that now is wanted to be a journalist.

1136
01:10:38.981 --> 01:10:42.910
That's what really the thing that I thought I was going to be at school.
Right.

1137
01:10:42.970 --> 01:10:45.940
Do you right now,
uh,
I was for a while,

1138
01:10:45.941 --> 01:10:50.941
but I looked at him and stuff just again everyday stuff or you know,

1139
01:10:50.951 --> 01:10:53.860
I'd like randomly pick something to write about.

1140
01:10:53.861 --> 01:10:57.820
So if it was Ken about the cannabis industry,
I'd write something about that.

1141
01:10:57.821 --> 01:11:01.740
If it was about the music industry,
I'd write something about that.

1142
01:11:01.741 --> 01:11:04.420
Like I that every now and then I would,
uh,
there was,
uh,

1143
01:11:04.810 --> 01:11:07.300
back in the early two thousands,

1144
01:11:07.301 --> 01:11:09.910
there was a magazine called industry insider magazine.

1145
01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:14.070
And occasionally I would write articles for that.
I wasn't

1146
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:18.780
<v 1>really that great because,
you know,
I was so spotty and school that,
you know,</v>

1147
01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:21.720
my,
you know,
it needed work,

1148
01:11:22.370 --> 01:11:24.620
but they left it raw the way that,
that,

1149
01:11:24.690 --> 01:11:28.740
that I would put it out there and people got my point and that,
that was cool.

1150
01:11:28.741 --> 01:11:33.160
But I looked at it in the way that the,

1151
01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:36.960
the music that I've done in a lot of the songs serve as a certain form of

1152
01:11:36.961 --> 01:11:40.530
journal journalism for me.
You know,
like,
you know,

1153
01:11:40.531 --> 01:11:43.530
bringing up certain issues that people don't necessarily hear.

1154
01:11:43.531 --> 01:11:46.310
Like throw your set in the air as a song on temple's boom.

1155
01:11:46.311 --> 01:11:50.500
And it's a song about how you would get,
you know,
in,

1156
01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:55.770
in inducted into a gang,
how you get put into a gang,
how you fall into it.

1157
01:11:56.340 --> 01:11:58.140
And some people might think,
you know,

1158
01:11:58.141 --> 01:12:01.860
by hearing it that it was glorifying it and praising it,
but it wasn't,

1159
01:12:01.861 --> 01:12:05.940
it was basically this is how it is.
This is so,
you know,

1160
01:12:05.941 --> 01:12:09.300
the signs to look for if your kids are,
you know,

1161
01:12:09.301 --> 01:12:13.440
fucking around with the wrong people,
you know?
And that's,
you know,

1162
01:12:14.070 --> 01:12:19.050
I took it like,
okay,
you know,
maybe I'm not a journalist,
like I tended to be,

1163
01:12:19.051 --> 01:12:21.000
but this is my way of it.
You know,

1164
01:12:21.001 --> 01:12:25.830
I can enlighten people with certain things and uh,
you know,
like anything,

1165
01:12:25.831 --> 01:12:29.820
somebody's going to read something or hear something and maybe misinterpret what

1166
01:12:29.821 --> 01:12:32.310
you say.
But you know,

1167
01:12:32.340 --> 01:12:35.970
it's all about who's who's listening and who's reading and who's watching and

1168
01:12:35.971 --> 01:12:39.510
stuff like that and their interpretation of it.
And some get it,
some don't.

1169
01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:42.840
And that's just the nature of it.
But like,
most people get it.
And I've,

1170
01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:47.670
I've come across people that have come to me and come and said,

1171
01:12:47.700 --> 01:12:51.630
hey man,
your,
your,
your songs on temple of boom men.
You know,
they,

1172
01:12:51.690 --> 01:12:55.500
they helped to get me through these times or these songs raised me,

1173
01:12:55.501 --> 01:13:00.240
they taught me this,
this and that.
That's awesome.
And to me,
you know,
that,
that's,

1174
01:13:00.510 --> 01:13:04.890
that's the impact right there.
That's the shit yeah.
Means more than anything.

1175
01:13:05.070 --> 01:13:08.640
Because I'm sure you remember songs that got you through,
right?
Oh yeah,
for sure.

1176
01:13:08.700 --> 01:13:12.740
You know,
there was songs from Krs one public enemy that,
you know,

1177
01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:18.540
got me through and fired me up,
you know,
and inspired and stuff like that.

1178
01:13:18.550 --> 01:13:22.190
Era's ones,
another one people forgot about,
man,
I'll be in my car just going,
Ooh,

1179
01:13:22.310 --> 01:13:26.640
that's nice.
Yeah.
I mean he,
he taught,

1180
01:13:26.700 --> 01:13:30.300
he taught me how to be a bull horn,
you know what I mean?
Like tell you know,

1181
01:13:30.330 --> 01:13:35.090
like yeah,
tell the truth,
you know,
yours tell,
get the word out and,
and,

1182
01:13:35.130 --> 01:13:39.150
and not be fearful of what might happen because he could have been one of the

1183
01:13:39.151 --> 01:13:42.870
biggest stars in,
in hip hop.
He chose not to be,

1184
01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:47.970
he chose to be a voice and sometimes and be in that voice,
you know,

1185
01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:52.890
you get objects put in front of you and uh,
certain opportunities don't,

1186
01:13:53.130 --> 01:13:56.400
you know,
get put on your table because he says some great shit,
man.

1187
01:13:56.401 --> 01:13:58.140
He's talking about getting mad at the president.

1188
01:13:58.141 --> 01:14:01.560
It's like being mad at the manager at McDonald's.
Yeah.
You know,

1189
01:14:01.650 --> 01:14:06.000
for the way the corporations being run.
Yeah.
It's,
it's he,

1190
01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:09.360
he is a very insightful in,

1191
01:14:09.361 --> 01:14:13.540
in the shit that he says and he is very unafraid to state it in state.

1192
01:14:13.541 --> 01:14:14.360
His opinion,

1193
01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:17.750
<v 0>if you to get like people coming up to you when they first started coming up to</v>

1194
01:14:17.751 --> 01:14:20.960
you,
telling you that your music got them through things,

1195
01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:23.660
that it means so much to them.
When that first started happening,

1196
01:14:23.870 --> 01:14:24.980
that must've been surreal,

1197
01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:30.540
<v 1>you know?
Yeah.
Because as an artist,
as especially as a young artist,
you'd,</v>

1198
01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:33.920
that's not something you think about.
All of these songs are going to,

1199
01:14:33.980 --> 01:14:37.700
well it depends on,
on the artist you are right guys hit.
How old were you?

1200
01:14:37.701 --> 01:14:41.860
Like 23 or something like that.
How old were you when that was like a,

1201
01:14:41.870 --> 01:14:46.700
we released in 91 and it really started going for us in 92 saws.

1202
01:14:46.730 --> 01:14:48.390
22 you're a kid.

1203
01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:53.990
<v 0>So crazy.
There goes the baby fro.
Wow.
Wow.</v>

1204
01:14:54.020 --> 01:14:57.230
Look at the baby fro.
But I mean,
think about that man.

1205
01:14:57.231 --> 01:15:01.550
That is so crazy for you to go from the guy who yo MTV raps.

1206
01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:03.320
Who remembers that?

1207
01:15:03.350 --> 01:15:07.580
I did a bungee jump at this spring break with treach from naughty by nature.

1208
01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:11.800
Was that the one that was in Cancun?
No,
that was Daytona beach.
Right,
okay.

1209
01:15:11.990 --> 01:15:15.770
When MTV was still,
when MTV was still allowed over there,

1210
01:15:15.850 --> 01:15:18.100
it was back when MTV had music.
Yeah.

1211
01:15:18.220 --> 01:15:23.220
When they had music format empty was MTV was music videos.

1212
01:15:24.140 --> 01:15:26.360
Good luck finding a fucking music video.
Now

1213
01:15:27.860 --> 01:15:32.210
I've got to go to youtube.
Yeah,
exactly.
Yeah.
Wow.

1214
01:15:32.270 --> 01:15:33.170
That is wild.

1215
01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:37.130
What was it like when it first started popping off and you were 22 years old?

1216
01:15:37.220 --> 01:15:38.690
Was it,
did it feel real?

1217
01:15:39.630 --> 01:15:40.290
<v 1>It was a,</v>

1218
01:15:40.290 --> 01:15:43.850
it was a crazy thing because it's not something that I had ever envisioned

1219
01:15:43.851 --> 01:15:46.670
happening.
You know,
I didn't think that,
you know,

1220
01:15:46.671 --> 01:15:48.770
the music would blow up like that.
You know,

1221
01:15:48.771 --> 01:15:52.790
we were doing it to obviously try and,
and,

1222
01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:57.330
and make a name for ourselves and,
and uh,
make music that people like,

1223
01:15:57.331 --> 01:15:59.120
but fuck,
we didn't see that coming in,

1224
01:16:00.110 --> 01:16:02.500
especially with insane in the brain when they told me,
uh,

1225
01:16:02.570 --> 01:16:06.980
when like when killer man started going,
it was like surreal because,

1226
01:16:07.010 --> 01:16:11.060
you know,
we didn't think that song would take just because it,
you know,
of,

1227
01:16:11.061 --> 01:16:15.740
of the chorus itself,
you know,
fuck what the song is about.
You know,

1228
01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:18.590
we knew that the chorus was,
you know,
what,

1229
01:16:18.591 --> 01:16:22.950
they were going to hear more than anything.
And so I,
you know,
we,
we thought,
no,

1230
01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:26.090
we're going to have a good underground album.
We didn't realize that it blow up.

1231
01:16:26.091 --> 01:16:29.780
We didn't think they were going to put kill a man in the juice movie and that

1232
01:16:29.781 --> 01:16:34.640
would blow that song up even more so than it was it was getting,
um,

1233
01:16:34.820 --> 01:16:39.200
because we had released funky fill ones first and it was a Aa side single funky

1234
01:16:39.201 --> 01:16:43.050
fill in and kill a man on the other a side,
which means,
um,

1235
01:16:43.370 --> 01:16:47.180
at that time that Djs had the option of which song they wanted to go.

1236
01:16:47.181 --> 01:16:51.380
Whereas most of the time you had a side B side in the ace side is most

1237
01:16:51.381 --> 01:16:55.430
definitely the one that the record company wants you to push.

1238
01:16:55.940 --> 01:17:00.920
We gave it a Aa side because we thought maybe the djs would like kill a man

1239
01:17:00.921 --> 01:17:01.700
more.

1240
01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:04.880
They went with funky fill when the record company because they figured it would

1241
01:17:04.940 --> 01:17:07.490
be easier to market.
Right.

1242
01:17:07.580 --> 01:17:12.500
And then the DJ started the record chorus and we started getting traction behind

1243
01:17:12.501 --> 01:17:12.680
that.

1244
01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:17.680
Our record was out like six months had dropped off the chart and they flipped

1245
01:17:18.081 --> 01:17:21.770
the record.
Our shit slowly starts to go back up the chart.

1246
01:17:22.010 --> 01:17:26.420
We got back on the chart and started climbing and we were getting a whole lot of

1247
01:17:26.421 --> 01:17:28.770
mixed show play and uh,

1248
01:17:29.540 --> 01:17:32.540
then we start doing a lot of promotional shows that being one of them.

1249
01:17:33.110 --> 01:17:37.400
And it started going and killing men started getting us going.
And uh,

1250
01:17:37.430 --> 01:17:42.350
I mean we toured for probably a year and a half,
like a lot,

1251
01:17:42.390 --> 01:17:46.370
just a lot of promotional shows,
not getting paid,
you know,
just,

1252
01:17:47.300 --> 01:17:51.530
you know,
Sony having us out there promoting the record and then by the time,
uh,

1253
01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:56.870
you know,
our record got back back up into the middle of the charts.
I mean,

1254
01:17:56.871 --> 01:17:59.150
it was still rising,
but,
and they saw that they were like,

1255
01:17:59.151 --> 01:18:02.540
we got to get them off the road and making a new record.

1256
01:18:02.900 --> 01:18:07.430
So that's when we got out there with black Sunday and a with black Sunday and

1257
01:18:07.431 --> 01:18:10.640
insane coming out again.
That's not a song.

1258
01:18:10.641 --> 01:18:13.320
I thought it would blow up when they've chose that for the single,
I'm like,
well,

1259
01:18:13.321 --> 01:18:16.880
all right,
there's better songs,
but fuck it.
That's the one.
Okay.

1260
01:18:17.690 --> 01:18:20.240
So it comes out,
boom,
it explodes.

1261
01:18:20.660 --> 01:18:23.390
And now we have our black Sunday charting.

1262
01:18:23.391 --> 01:18:26.420
At number one coming in and our,

1263
01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:30.800
our first album had come all the way from the bottom to hit number five.

1264
01:18:31.100 --> 01:18:34.400
So we had to two albums in the top 10,

1265
01:18:34.450 --> 01:18:38.840
200 top 10 of the 200 songs,
you know,

1266
01:18:38.841 --> 01:18:41.960
on the chart,
which no one had ever done in hip hop before.

1267
01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:46.340
We had one in five slot and uh,
you know,
fuck,

1268
01:18:46.341 --> 01:18:49.670
we definitely didn't think that was going to happen.
I mean,
you know,

1269
01:18:49.671 --> 01:18:54.671
it was all a surprise and it went from one minute you could go to a mall and be,

1270
01:18:55.521 --> 01:18:59.150
you know,
unassuming and nobody even knows who the fuck you are and you know,

1271
01:18:59.151 --> 01:19:03.740
you're getting about your day to now you go to the mall and the whole fucking

1272
01:19:03.741 --> 01:19:07.610
mall is swarming on you.
Like fucking,
you're like,
you know,

1273
01:19:07.611 --> 01:19:08.840
Paul Mccartney or something.

1274
01:19:09.140 --> 01:19:13.460
It was the craziest shit they would ask us to leave the mall's like really?
Yeah,

1275
01:19:13.461 --> 01:19:18.170
like uh,
we used to,
I used to go to this one called the Montebello Mo.

1276
01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:21.170
It was in Montebello.
I can't remember what the name of the mall was,

1277
01:19:21.171 --> 01:19:23.660
but it was in Montebello.
The only one down there at the time.

1278
01:19:24.230 --> 01:19:27.290
And we knew everybody there,
you know,

1279
01:19:27.530 --> 01:19:30.890
as we're coming up because that's where we'd go shop.
So you know,

1280
01:19:30.891 --> 01:19:35.110
you make friends and people in the shop and stuff like that.
And uh,

1281
01:19:35.300 --> 01:19:39.350
when we come back off the tour this time and go try to go to that mall,

1282
01:19:40.190 --> 01:19:40.551
you know,

1283
01:19:40.551 --> 01:19:44.720
one of our friends fucked up and wore a Cypress hill jacket and that's like a

1284
01:19:44.721 --> 01:19:47.690
fucking billboard when you're standing next to one of us.
Right.

1285
01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:50.000
So before you know it,
boom,

1286
01:19:50.001 --> 01:19:53.270
we get swooped in and you know as a pre cell phone too.
Yeah.

1287
01:19:53.271 --> 01:19:57.230
And the mall security cause hey man,
you know,
I know it's fucked up,

1288
01:19:57.231 --> 01:20:00.950
but you guys got to go.
Really?

1289
01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:05.090
Yeah Man,
it's a commotion.
You guys got to go.
They're telling me,
I'm like,

1290
01:20:05.270 --> 01:20:08.130
they think someone's going to fight.
I'm wow.

1291
01:20:09.090 --> 01:20:12.870
I never went back to that mall after that.
Alright,
cool.

1292
01:20:13.650 --> 01:20:16.680
Because you know,
when I didn't want to cause them problems too,

1293
01:20:17.070 --> 01:20:22.070
it was now it was tough to go somewhere at that time and not get,

1294
01:20:22.500 --> 01:20:27.450
you know,
swarmed and that get swarmed.
Yeah.
It was,
it was,
uh,
it was quite,

1295
01:20:27.990 --> 01:20:30.810
quite,
uh,
an experience man.
Like,
you know,

1296
01:20:30.811 --> 01:20:35.250
cause you only ever hear about it until it happens.
And you might,
you know,

1297
01:20:35.251 --> 01:20:38.280
if you have friends in the,
in the industry and it's happening for them,

1298
01:20:38.281 --> 01:20:41.970
you might see it in directly,
you know,
like through the,
through their shit.

1299
01:20:42.900 --> 01:20:46.290
And uh,
you know,
we had friends in the business,
you know,

1300
01:20:47.030 --> 01:20:49.080
kid frost was one of my friends,
um,

1301
01:20:49.230 --> 01:20:52.290
before we got out there and cause he's still around.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1302
01:20:52.291 --> 01:20:54.030
He still does stuff,
you know.
Um,

1303
01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:57.480
I don't know if he's putting out so much new music these days,

1304
01:20:57.481 --> 01:20:59.610
but he's still here and there.

1305
01:20:59.611 --> 01:21:04.530
He's doing some of the cannabis industry stuff too because he's a big kind of

1306
01:21:04.531 --> 01:21:08.520
sore.
I got to tell you,
my man smokes used to smoke like a train man,

1307
01:21:08.580 --> 01:21:12.810
like him and I would trade joints off left and right.
But you know,
for a time,

1308
01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:16.170
you know,
I would go hang with him at his gigs.

1309
01:21:16.171 --> 01:21:20.190
I'd be his bodyguard cause I was the one that was not afraid to carry the
hammer,

1310
01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:25.340
meaning the magnum in my waistline.
You know,
I was,
we were cowboys,
man.
We,

1311
01:21:25.341 --> 01:21:28.110
we were always armed at that time,

1312
01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:32.610
from 89 to probably 97 or 98,

1313
01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:37.350
we were holding pistols on our hip,
like cowboys.
And,

1314
01:21:37.351 --> 01:21:41.970
you know,
he knew that.
So yes.
But he would ask me to go to the gigs,
you know,
to,

1315
01:21:42.030 --> 01:21:45.750
you know,
double as his body guard.
I wasn't his body guard,

1316
01:21:45.751 --> 01:21:47.490
but I was his body guard.
You know what I mean?

1317
01:21:48.130 --> 01:21:52.610
And I'd see the way he handled it and let's see the way,
you know,

1318
01:21:52.611 --> 01:21:57.450
people crowded around him and,
and uh,
you know,
I saw,

1319
01:21:57.451 --> 01:22:00.060
I learned how to deal with it,
watching,
you know,

1320
01:22:00.061 --> 01:22:03.870
how he would do it in a negative way or a positive way.
Cause,
you know,

1321
01:22:03.871 --> 01:22:08.130
he was sometimes embrace the crowds.
Sometimes it's like,
fuck off me.

1322
01:22:08.730 --> 01:22:12.270
You know,
like a lot a lot of artists are,
you know,
and uh,

1323
01:22:13.380 --> 01:22:18.240
that sort of prepared me so that when,
you know,
we got an arf lane,
you know,

1324
01:22:18.930 --> 01:22:22.320
I knew how to sort of deal with it and I,
you know,
was always courteous and,

1325
01:22:22.321 --> 01:22:26.490
and cool and respectful and never the guy that is like,
Nah man,
fuck that.

1326
01:22:26.490 --> 01:22:30.360
Get out of here.
Cause I see it in some of my homies were like that,
you know,

1327
01:22:30.361 --> 01:22:34.410
and I didn't,
I hated the feeling that when the fans would walk away,

1328
01:22:34.411 --> 01:22:38.430
just totally fucking wind out of their sails and shit like that.

1329
01:22:38.670 --> 01:22:41.490
Now they don't like this artists ever again,
you know?

1330
01:22:41.491 --> 01:22:45.970
And I saw that and I never wanted to have anyone walk away with that experience.

1331
01:22:45.990 --> 01:22:49.640
Always embraced it even when it was a pain in the ass,
you know?

1332
01:22:50.340 --> 01:22:53.140
So when was your first time ever getting onstage?

1333
01:22:53.250 --> 01:22:58.230
Do you remember first time that they used to be a club called radiotron here in

1334
01:22:58.231 --> 01:23:02.310
the 80s right.
And it was the hip hop club.
If you were into hip hop,

1335
01:23:02.700 --> 01:23:06.130
any aspect of it,
whether it was wrapping,
dancing,
popping,

1336
01:23:06.130 --> 01:23:10.660
<v 0>graffitiing all the people went to that spot and um,</v>

1337
01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:15.340
it was hard to get in there and it was hard to get on the mic no less.
Um,

1338
01:23:15.370 --> 01:23:20.050
but we had a homie who was like a legendary Dj out here when,
when,
uh,

1339
01:23:20.740 --> 01:23:25.190
the am station was playing hip hop,
his name was Tony g and he was,
uh,
the,

1340
01:23:25.191 --> 01:23:26.920
the leader of the mix master show.

1341
01:23:26.950 --> 01:23:31.240
They had mixed master and he had a residency at the radio tron.

1342
01:23:31.241 --> 01:23:35.680
So we grew up with one of his,
um,
when his boys,

1343
01:23:35.681 --> 01:23:39.670
that was his,
like his a protege.

1344
01:23:40.630 --> 01:23:45.630
So they invited us over and myself in San got on the mic and mellow and I froze

1345
01:23:47.201 --> 01:23:50.290
the fuck.
I tell you,
I froze up.

1346
01:23:50.291 --> 01:23:54.590
I forgot every rap I ever wrote or ever memorized.
I was like,
uh,

1347
01:23:56.290 --> 01:24:00.260
it would be one of the two times that I would freeze in my life.
And,
and it was,

1348
01:24:00.330 --> 01:24:04.780
that was the first time I was on stage and all those people looking at me

1349
01:24:04.781 --> 01:24:08.500
waiting,
expecting something.
I totally blew it.
You know,

1350
01:24:08.530 --> 01:24:12.340
and I told myself,
okay,
I got to get over the nervousness.

1351
01:24:12.341 --> 01:24:16.530
And then the other thing we were doing was,
uh,
it was like,
um,

1352
01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:21.790
they,
they wanted rappers to do this PSA for some bullshit,
right?

1353
01:24:21.850 --> 01:24:26.850
And they wanted us to write this wrap and put all this certain information in

1354
01:24:27.461 --> 01:24:29.920
there.
And I had it,
I had it memorized.

1355
01:24:29.921 --> 01:24:34.390
I hadn't locked in the minute they said go and they were filming it,
you know,

1356
01:24:34.391 --> 01:24:38.560
this is to film it.
I kept fucking it up horribly.

1357
01:24:38.770 --> 01:24:42.780
I didn't even get through it.
I was like,
I'm sorry I can't do it.
Fuck,
you know,

1358
01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:47.710
I was getting mad at myself too.
Like,
fuck,
what's wrong with me?
No,
it wasn't.

1359
01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:50.380
Maybe that was a problem.
That was probably the problem,
you know,

1360
01:24:50.381 --> 01:24:53.350
cause when I'm not high as when it's shit like this happens,
right?

1361
01:24:53.740 --> 01:24:58.060
So those are the two times that I totally fucked it up.

1362
01:24:58.120 --> 01:25:01.600
And I like from the last time I said,
I'll never do that again.

1363
01:25:01.601 --> 01:25:05.590
I'm going to be prepared and I'm going to get through the anxiety or whatever it

1364
01:25:05.591 --> 01:25:09.730
is.
And,
um,
so those were the first two times,

1365
01:25:09.731 --> 01:25:14.731
but the first time on stage where I actually pulled it off was probably one of

1366
01:25:14.831 --> 01:25:19.510
our first showcases.
It was that,
uh,
it was at this place off of the 10,

1367
01:25:20.020 --> 01:25:22.900
and it wasn't a showcase,
it was actually a competition.

1368
01:25:22.901 --> 01:25:27.260
You know how they used to do competitions?
It's clubs like fucking uh,

1369
01:25:27.580 --> 01:25:30.940
what do they call it?
A,
forgot what they used to call them,
but you know,

1370
01:25:30.941 --> 01:25:33.880
different bands with,
it was like a battle of the bands,
right?

1371
01:25:33.881 --> 01:25:38.881
So we went in and I'm coming off of that horrible fucking deal that had just

1372
01:25:41.231 --> 01:25:45.660
happened,
you know,
maybe a month or two before.
And I totally got over it and,

1373
01:25:45.661 --> 01:25:48.190
and we were performing real estate,
you know,

1374
01:25:48.250 --> 01:25:50.980
in this showcase and we lost.

1375
01:25:51.340 --> 01:25:54.880
But we made the biggest impression there because the song,
you know,

1376
01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:58.870
we performed it like,
you know,
the way that it supposed to be.

1377
01:25:59.290 --> 01:26:03.650
And then at the end,
sen out jumped on the big judges' table and he,
you know,

1378
01:26:03.651 --> 01:26:04.130
he grabbed

1379
01:26:04.130 --> 01:26:09.130
<v 1>his balls right in front of the fucking female judge as he jumps off the table.</v>

1380
01:26:09.201 --> 01:26:12.470
It breaks in half into her lap and

1381
01:26:14.090 --> 01:26:18.770
everybody loved it.
We lost to these dudes who are like new,
a new edition to,

1382
01:26:18.890 --> 01:26:22.700
we called them tootsie rolls,
but we don't remember they won.

1383
01:26:22.910 --> 01:26:24.410
But in reality we want,

1384
01:26:24.411 --> 01:26:28.640
because that's what everybody was talking about us at the end,
you know,

1385
01:26:28.641 --> 01:26:33.170
like how raw that wasn't.
After that show I realized,

1386
01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:38.570
you know,
this is,
this is how I'm supposed to do it.
And I seen Krs one,

1387
01:26:39.340 --> 01:26:42.440
uh,
do a show one time where the sound went out.

1388
01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:46.400
He didn't have a stage that he was on a couple of tables that were put together

1389
01:26:46.790 --> 01:26:51.290
and he just got up in front of the whole club,
no microphone,
no music,

1390
01:26:51.530 --> 01:26:53.570
and just started rapping his versus,

1391
01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:58.250
and people were rapping right along with them not giving a fuck that the sound

1392
01:26:58.400 --> 01:26:59.031
turned off,

1393
01:26:59.031 --> 01:27:04.031
but the fact that he just continued to do the show and that right there taught

1394
01:27:05.151 --> 01:27:09.140
me a lot about how you control shit on stage.
Yeah.

1395
01:27:09.141 --> 01:27:13.880
Sometimes on when things go wrong,
it's a great opportunity.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

1396
01:27:13.881 --> 01:27:15.680
I did a show at the Improv last month,

1397
01:27:16.100 --> 01:27:19.280
like maybe my last month or the month before the power went out.
And then like a,

1398
01:27:19.310 --> 01:27:23.510
what do you want to do?
I said,
fuck it.
Let's do a show.
I could yell.
Yeah.

1399
01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:27.750
So we just did.
Everybody just did the show would no microphone.
But that was,

1400
01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:31.660
you know,
the Improv,
the small room.
It's only 180 people.
Yeah.
I mean that,

1401
01:27:31.700 --> 01:27:35.440
that place was,
you know,
a small place too.
But I mean it,

1402
01:27:35.470 --> 01:27:39.950
it goes to show you man,
like if you got it,
you got to do it.

1403
01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:42.620
It's probably better sometimes because it's unique.
Yeah.

1404
01:27:42.621 --> 01:27:46.160
Cause people will remember,
you know,
the other way.
Yeah.
You know,

1405
01:27:46.161 --> 01:27:49.070
it probably would have been a great show and people would be talking about it,

1406
01:27:49.071 --> 01:27:53.570
but they'll remember the fact that you got over that adversity and we're able to

1407
01:27:53.571 --> 01:27:58.130
still deliver.
And that's the shit that krs one did for me.

1408
01:27:58.131 --> 01:28:00.110
He showed me through the adversity,

1409
01:28:00.650 --> 01:28:04.700
he kept doing the show and the people were still with them.
And I thought,
okay,

1410
01:28:05.300 --> 01:28:10.280
one day that's going to be me and I'm going to do what the teacher does.
And,

1411
01:28:10.281 --> 01:28:11.600
uh,
you know,
that,
that,

1412
01:28:12.410 --> 01:28:16.310
that had been one of the most important things that I learned,
you know,

1413
01:28:16.311 --> 01:28:21.311
and watching others do shows and stuff like that and what I would do when I got

1414
01:28:22.131 --> 01:28:26.510
up there,
you know,
and,
uh,
I,
I applied all those,
those,
you know,

1415
01:28:26.511 --> 01:28:27.920
lessons men,
you know,
and,

1416
01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:33.280
and it's made me who I am as my part of Cypress Hill and when I do my solo stuff

1417
01:28:33.291 --> 01:28:35.930
and when I'm with prophets of rage that,
you know,

1418
01:28:35.931 --> 01:28:40.310
that got me prepped for everything that I do now in terms of music now,

1419
01:28:40.311 --> 01:28:41.061
how did you,
well,

1420
01:28:41.061 --> 01:28:45.050
it's good that to you free to tell people that you had a real hard time your

1421
01:28:45.051 --> 01:28:47.960
first time performing.
Oh yeah.
There's probably a lot of people out there.

1422
01:28:47.961 --> 01:28:52.100
They'll never say anxious and yeah,
a lot of people never say that the lie,

1423
01:28:52.101 --> 01:28:52.934
you know?
But that's,

1424
01:28:53.030 --> 01:28:56.640
I think that's important and there's nothing wrong with those feelings,
man.
It's,

1425
01:28:56.641 --> 01:29:01.010
it's good you got to learn,
man.
You're a kid.
It's,
it's,
it's like,
uh,

1426
01:29:01.170 --> 01:29:02.640
you liking it to,

1427
01:29:02.670 --> 01:29:07.670
to like college stars that are coming into the professional sports now.

1428
01:29:08.161 --> 01:29:11.490
Like basketball players for instance.
You get this number one draft pick,

1429
01:29:12.120 --> 01:29:15.510
he comes to a team and everybody has these high expectations.

1430
01:29:15.780 --> 01:29:17.910
No one knows that this kid,
you know,

1431
01:29:17.940 --> 01:29:22.940
some people own this space like Lebron and Kolby and Kevin Garnett who've came

1432
01:29:23.131 --> 01:29:27.330
straight from high school and they own the space.
The minute they got in it.

1433
01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:31.230
I mean,
Colby had to work,
he wasn't the greatest,
you know,
when he,

1434
01:29:31.231 --> 01:29:34.980
when he started,
he had to work to get to where he was at and,

1435
01:29:35.670 --> 01:29:40.650
and a,
a lot of these guys do,
some of them,
you know,
again,

1436
01:29:41.550 --> 01:29:45.690
they come in and they already got it.
You know,
like Lebron,
he was,
you know,

1437
01:29:45.900 --> 01:29:49.890
plan and Groans Ma grown man's game right when he got into the league,

1438
01:29:49.891 --> 01:29:54.060
thrown into the fire.
But he was ready for that.
He got better and,

1439
01:29:54.080 --> 01:29:57.570
and learn the role and learned who he was as he's gone.

1440
01:29:57.571 --> 01:30:02.040
But he was one of those rare thing,
rare people that can just jump into it.

1441
01:30:02.041 --> 01:30:05.040
Some people have to get better at it.
And you know,

1442
01:30:05.220 --> 01:30:06.720
it's the same thing with music.

1443
01:30:06.721 --> 01:30:09.990
Like you get thrown on on that big stage for the first time.

1444
01:30:10.380 --> 01:30:13.320
If you're not prepped for it,
you're going to definitely be nervous.

1445
01:30:13.680 --> 01:30:16.730
Now you could either embrace that and it'll,

1446
01:30:16.740 --> 01:30:19.800
it'll be your first show and you could do a good one or you could do a horrible

1447
01:30:19.801 --> 01:30:24.690
one.
But either way you can learn from that.
And uh,
if you don't learn from it,

1448
01:30:24.691 --> 01:30:28.460
then the run is short.
If you learn from it,
you know,
you know,

1449
01:30:28.500 --> 01:30:32.130
you learn how to get better and sustain a longer career.

1450
01:30:32.310 --> 01:30:36.060
How did you learn how to get over the anxiety,
like your first show,
having a,

1451
01:30:36.150 --> 01:30:40.680
the first show suck like that.
What was the,
what was,
what did you learn?

1452
01:30:40.740 --> 01:30:45.450
Like how did you,
how did you take classes?
Did you read a book?

1453
01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:46.041
You know,

1454
01:30:46.041 --> 01:30:51.041
what we did that helped me was that we rehearsed a lot because for me it was

1455
01:30:51.091 --> 01:30:52.800
like more remembering the songs.

1456
01:30:52.801 --> 01:30:57.540
It wasn't like the nerve to go out in front of people because we came from the

1457
01:30:57.541 --> 01:31:01.890
break dance and be boy culture,
the popping and stuff like that.

1458
01:31:01.891 --> 01:31:06.891
So much of that is going against someone battling someone in front of a crowd.

1459
01:31:08.100 --> 01:31:12.180
And if you can be in front of a crowd doing that,
cause that's vulnerable.
I mean,

1460
01:31:12.181 --> 01:31:16.050
you know,
because in a battle you could either win or you lose.
And if you lose,

1461
01:31:16.051 --> 01:31:16.321
you know,

1462
01:31:16.321 --> 01:31:21.150
obviously you could lose it in an embarrassing way or you lose in a close

1463
01:31:21.151 --> 01:31:23.910
battle.
But either way people are sitting there watching you,

1464
01:31:24.270 --> 01:31:28.560
judging you either cheering your boo and you wouldn't,
you know,
any one of those.

1465
01:31:29.220 --> 01:31:34.200
So that helped me be able to get on stage and perform in front of people.

1466
01:31:34.530 --> 01:31:36.630
It for more from me,

1467
01:31:36.631 --> 01:31:39.930
it was more about knowing the songs,

1468
01:31:40.170 --> 01:31:45.000
making sure that I know him through the nervousness,
you know?
And so for us,

1469
01:31:45.120 --> 01:31:49.710
we did a lot of rehearsals in the early days just so that those first shows that

1470
01:31:49.711 --> 01:31:53.100
we did,
that we were locked in and we made an impression.

1471
01:31:53.610 --> 01:31:54.750
And you know,

1472
01:31:54.751 --> 01:31:59.751
when we did that and we saw the results of how people were reacting to our show,

1473
01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:03.640
<v 0>it gave me more confidence.
So,
you know,
I'd,</v>

1474
01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:08.530
I'd rehearse the songs in my head,
you know,
when I wasn't around the other guys,

1475
01:32:08.650 --> 01:32:12.610
I'd be kicking the songs and I'd be,
or be on a treadmill working out,

1476
01:32:12.950 --> 01:32:14.740
say in the songs,
you know,

1477
01:32:14.741 --> 01:32:18.940
getting them in my head and just gave me the confidence that I know this fucking

1478
01:32:18.941 --> 01:32:21.580
shit.
I go up there,
I'll rock this fucking thing.

1479
01:32:21.610 --> 01:32:25.330
I'm not going to forget it because that's always the problem for me.

1480
01:32:25.331 --> 01:32:27.520
It was never getting in front of people.

1481
01:32:27.521 --> 01:32:32.470
It was do I know my shit and now I know it in such a way that like,

1482
01:32:32.500 --> 01:32:37.120
you know,
it's second nature.
Do I still get those nervous butterflies?

1483
01:32:37.150 --> 01:32:40.360
Yeah,
for sure.
Some shows depending who's watching,

1484
01:32:40.361 --> 01:32:44.480
who's on the side stage or how big the crowd is and whatnot.
Yeah,

1485
01:32:44.481 --> 01:32:48.330
I still get some of that.
But you know,
I,

1486
01:32:48.700 --> 01:32:52.420
I do a quick meditation before I go out there,
you know,

1487
01:32:52.421 --> 01:32:56.380
just in my head real quick.
And then our band prayer.

1488
01:32:56.950 --> 01:33:00.250
And then that's the,
that's the switch right there.
And we go and we're ready.

1489
01:33:00.251 --> 01:33:03.820
And it,
but it took me a while to get to that,
you know,
because it takes work.

1490
01:33:03.821 --> 01:33:06.160
It's like anything,
if you're athlete,
if you're a boxer,

1491
01:33:06.460 --> 01:33:11.230
you're only gonna get better by boxing all the time.
Training all the time,

1492
01:33:11.231 --> 01:33:14.260
not overtraining,
but making sure that you're in,
they're putting in the work.

1493
01:33:14.261 --> 01:33:17.920
And it's the same thing when you're rocking stages,
you know,
um,

1494
01:33:18.730 --> 01:33:23.650
a lot of us sometimes forget to go and put the time in and rehearse and you

1495
01:33:23.651 --> 01:33:28.510
could see that when there's a sloppy show or someone's out of breath,

1496
01:33:28.511 --> 01:33:31.360
or they're not saying the whole line,
or they said the line wrong,

1497
01:33:31.361 --> 01:33:34.960
or they're changing up fragments of the song to make it easier for their

1498
01:33:34.961 --> 01:33:38.650
performance and it doesn't necessarily fit.
That's when,
you know,

1499
01:33:38.651 --> 01:33:43.150
somebody ain't putting in the work.
But for us,
you know,
we always,

1500
01:33:44.050 --> 01:33:46.330
you know,
that was a part of the draw for Cypress.

1501
01:33:46.331 --> 01:33:50.920
That's how he won a lot of people over was the energy of our live show.
So,
um,

1502
01:33:51.580 --> 01:33:53.230
but it took that the rehearsals,

1503
01:33:53.231 --> 01:33:56.680
men and I would tell any artists coming up right now,
man,

1504
01:33:56.681 --> 01:33:59.050
before you start doing your shows you,

1505
01:33:59.051 --> 01:34:04.051
because you may get a hit like that fast these days and you may be called to go

1506
01:34:04.691 --> 01:34:05.680
do that show.
Now.

1507
01:34:05.681 --> 01:34:10.660
If you don't do that show right and you suck as good as that song is,

1508
01:34:10.661 --> 01:34:14.020
you're never going to sell tickets when they fucking say,
hey,

1509
01:34:14.380 --> 01:34:19.000
so and so's performing at the,
you know,
this place,
ah fuck that.

1510
01:34:19.001 --> 01:34:22.270
I'd rather just listen to the record.
He sucks life,
you know,

1511
01:34:22.271 --> 01:34:26.500
so the rehearse man rehearse and then after that,
hey,
take,
you know,

1512
01:34:26.530 --> 01:34:30.550
do what you will.
But those they fucking help man.
You know,

1513
01:34:31.090 --> 01:34:35.140
for your confidence on performing the song.
That's a wise thing to tell people,

1514
01:34:35.141 --> 01:34:38.770
man.
Beat up professional.
Be a pro.
You can be a professional.

1515
01:34:38.771 --> 01:34:41.350
Decide you're a professional that's right in that fucking work.

1516
01:34:41.620 --> 01:34:44.990
That work does give you confidence and it works.
It works with fighting.

1517
01:34:44.991 --> 01:34:48.040
It works with comedy.
I'm sure it works with everything.
Yeah man.

1518
01:34:48.070 --> 01:34:49.420
You gotta be proficient,

1519
01:34:49.480 --> 01:34:53.950
professional de professional and official at the same time,

1520
01:34:53.951 --> 01:34:58.610
produce show,
what is the meditation that you do?
Just the self awareness,

1521
01:34:58.611 --> 01:35:02.240
you know what I mean,
like the circular breathing,
you know,
and uh,

1522
01:35:02.270 --> 01:35:06.320
concentrating on that and in the moment and then,
you know,

1523
01:35:06.321 --> 01:35:11.150
just letting that clear in my head,

1524
01:35:11.390 --> 01:35:14.420
you know what I mean?
Just focus,
focusing on the breathing.

1525
01:35:14.421 --> 01:35:17.570
I mean that's what they tell you pretty much in any meditation to focus on the

1526
01:35:17.571 --> 01:35:19.970
breathing and all these things are gonna come through your head.

1527
01:35:20.450 --> 01:35:23.630
But if you keep on focusing on that,
you know,

1528
01:35:24.380 --> 01:35:29.280
everything sort of goes away and your,
your reset.
So,
you know,
I'll,

1529
01:35:29.281 --> 01:35:34.160
I'll do that when,
when I feel maybe some sort of anxiety before going on.

1530
01:35:34.820 --> 01:35:37.820
If I don't feel that I don't necessarily do the meditation on,

1531
01:35:37.970 --> 01:35:41.600
we'll just do the prayer and that's sort of like,
you know,
sets it all in.

1532
01:35:41.601 --> 01:35:45.330
But yeah,
like some shows,
man,
I'll,

1533
01:35:45.340 --> 01:35:49.550
I'll have to like go in a room and just sit there and you know,

1534
01:35:49.700 --> 01:35:50.810
do the breathing man.

1535
01:35:50.820 --> 01:35:54.200
And it helps people might think about what the fuck is I going to do?

1536
01:35:54.201 --> 01:35:57.830
It's going to reset your mind and give you some clarity,
you know,

1537
01:35:57.831 --> 01:35:59.540
for me at least that's what it did.

1538
01:35:59.660 --> 01:36:02.930
What's the biggest crowd you guys ever performed in front of?
Um,

1539
01:36:03.830 --> 01:36:08.720
I think the biggest was Wa with stock 94,
I think it was 93,

1540
01:36:08.721 --> 01:36:13.290
94 and that was like 300 and 380,
some odd thousand.

1541
01:36:18.140 --> 01:36:22.460
<v 1>We've done some big ones like
European country.
We,</v>

1542
01:36:22.461 --> 01:36:27.380
we've done sounds like,
you know,
like at,
you know,
100,000 people,

1543
01:36:27.381 --> 01:36:29.870
100 videos.
Oh my God.

1544
01:36:29.871 --> 01:36:32.480
I got to see this fucking insane.

1545
01:36:33.180 --> 01:36:38.120
That is insane.
I had just cut my hair right there.
I was like,
you know,

1546
01:36:38.230 --> 01:36:43.100
whew.
Oh my God.
See the little guy next to mugs.

1547
01:36:43.580 --> 01:36:48.230
He was our,
our,
our,
our uh,
our miniature knockout guy.

1548
01:36:48.710 --> 01:36:51.890
He knew Jujitsu,
taekwondo showed up.
[inaudible] he trained with,

1549
01:36:51.980 --> 01:36:55.010
with my boy Kenji,
and he was,
he was like,
uh,

1550
01:36:55.040 --> 01:36:59.450
he was like our unofficial security and that's hilarious.
Cause Unassuming,
right?

1551
01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:02.600
Yeah,
he's a little guy.
I mean he even did,

1552
01:37:02.750 --> 01:37:07.680
he even did a few MMA fights.
Some years fucking crowd.

1553
01:37:09.010 --> 01:37:11.870
I almost lost my shit right here because you know,

1554
01:37:11.871 --> 01:37:16.871
seeing 300 and some odd thousand people jumping around to your shit.

1555
01:37:16.940 --> 01:37:20.390
God,
you know,
it could give you some equilibrium problems

1556
01:37:22.180 --> 01:37:26.750
cause it's the,
it looks like waves crashing into each other when it's that big.

1557
01:37:27.260 --> 01:37:27.411
I mean,

1558
01:37:27.411 --> 01:37:30.710
that's gotta be one of the biggest concert ever anybody's ever performed in

1559
01:37:30.711 --> 01:37:34.430
front of,
in North America for sure.
I mean in all of human history.
Yeah.

1560
01:37:34.431 --> 01:37:36.430
It was one of the biggest,
how the fuck you mean?
What do,

1561
01:37:36.580 --> 01:37:41.180
how do you get it more than 380,000 people together?
Yeah.

1562
01:37:41.810 --> 01:37:44.810
That's probably only happened a few times.
It's,
it's crazy.
I mean,

1563
01:37:44.811 --> 01:37:49.070
every band they had on this,
this particular bill was huge at the time.

1564
01:37:49.130 --> 01:37:52.340
He knows so it was,
yeah,
it was,

1565
01:37:52.341 --> 01:37:55.040
it was pretty crazy trying to just get there.
We like some of,

1566
01:37:55.140 --> 01:37:59.490
had to get in through boat.
Some of us had to get in through helicopter.
Why?

1567
01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:02.310
Cause there's so many.
Because they had started parking on the roads,

1568
01:38:02.311 --> 01:38:06.420
like the old school to Woodstock and they jacked up the highways and stuff like

1569
01:38:06.421 --> 01:38:09.450
that.
They parked like they pretty much shut the shit down

1570
01:38:10.950 --> 01:38:14.250
and I went in through helicopter and some of the other guys went into the book.

1571
01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:19.020
That's when you know you're on top of the world flying into a show in a fucking

1572
01:38:19.021 --> 01:38:20.040
helicopter girl.

1573
01:38:20.550 --> 01:38:23.990
That's when you realize why you can never get away from the cops when they're

1574
01:38:26.070 --> 01:38:28.230
fucking see everything.
But that's a funny thing man.

1575
01:38:28.231 --> 01:38:30.840
When you watch those dudes that are trying to escape from the cops on the ground

1576
01:38:30.870 --> 01:38:32.870
and then you watched the cops in the helicopter,

1577
01:38:32.871 --> 01:38:37.660
the spotlight just stay in the car the entire time.
They'll get that area.
That's,

1578
01:38:37.740 --> 01:38:40.380
yeah,
that's,
and that's just a piece of it right there.

1579
01:38:40.470 --> 01:38:44.160
And they had a rotating stage.
What are you doing?
You have to take a shit.

1580
01:38:44.700 --> 01:38:47.520
Like how long does it take to get from the front row to the back?

1581
01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:48.571
I'll take your shit tell you.

1582
01:38:48.571 --> 01:38:53.571
We walked around in that shit right there and it was super muddy and crazy and

1583
01:38:53.641 --> 01:38:57.750
people were like,
button naked with mud smeared all over there.
Fucking bodies.

1584
01:38:58.350 --> 01:39:02.030
It was like people went primal.
I swear to God it,

1585
01:39:02.250 --> 01:39:06.930
there you go right there.
They were having mud slide.
Laurie's.
Oh man,

1586
01:39:06.931 --> 01:39:09.810
that looks awesome.
People made babies that Dan their tent.

1587
01:39:09.990 --> 01:39:13.200
I'm sure they did a for sure they did.
I yeah sure.

1588
01:39:13.201 --> 01:39:15.360
There's a lot of people out there right now.
It was,
it was,

1589
01:39:15.361 --> 01:39:17.550
it was fucking crazy man.
I got to tell you there was,

1590
01:39:17.570 --> 01:39:22.570
there was people out there totally hippied out like straight up butt naked in

1591
01:39:23.371 --> 01:39:25.830
the,
you know,
and there was a good portion of them.
I mean not,

1592
01:39:25.860 --> 01:39:29.430
not in terms of the whole concert of is a small percentage,

1593
01:39:29.431 --> 01:39:33.720
but like you've seen just naked people walking around free out there.

1594
01:39:33.721 --> 01:39:37.980
It was crazy as fuck.
We like are we,

1595
01:39:38.160 --> 01:39:42.990
is this really happening shit man.
And then the mud was so thick,

1596
01:39:42.991 --> 01:39:46.260
man.
It was the type where like if you walked through it with your shoes and your

1597
01:39:46.261 --> 01:39:48.510
shoes weren't tight or you weren't wearing boots,

1598
01:39:48.780 --> 01:39:51.060
it was sucking the shoe right off of your foot.

1599
01:39:51.810 --> 01:39:56.160
It happened to me a number of times hell and that show I jumped into the crowd

1600
01:39:56.161 --> 01:40:00.690
cause normally I would jump into the crowd and uh,
you know,
just be floating,

1601
01:40:00.691 --> 01:40:04.920
you know,
stage dive style.
But I would still be doing the song right.

1602
01:40:05.370 --> 01:40:09.420
And uh,
on that particular show they took my shoes and socks.

1603
01:40:10.710 --> 01:40:14.790
I got back on stage with no,
she was in socks.
And you know,

1604
01:40:14.791 --> 01:40:17.040
about 15 years later,
you know,

1605
01:40:17.070 --> 01:40:20.110
I had one guy with one shoe come to show,

1606
01:40:20.610 --> 01:40:25.430
inflict and have me sign it.
Oh.
And then the other shoe,
some,
uh,

1607
01:40:25.530 --> 01:40:30.450
some chick had it and had me sign it later.
So I caught up with both shoes.

1608
01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:35.430
The socks didn't catch up with the socks,
didn't catch up to stocks,

1609
01:40:35.940 --> 01:40:37.770
but the shoes yet caught up with them.

1610
01:40:38.190 --> 01:40:41.070
What do they have a limited amount of tickets for Woodstock?
I mean,

1611
01:40:41.071 --> 01:40:42.990
what the fuck did they do when you get that many people?

1612
01:40:43.020 --> 01:40:47.850
I think they probably started with some sort of limit and became Kay and then it

1613
01:40:47.851 --> 01:40:50.760
became chaos,
you know,
like did something they couldn't handle.

1614
01:40:50.761 --> 01:40:54.330
I mean if you lived there,
stretch it to send it upon your stuff.

1615
01:40:54.940 --> 01:40:58.480
I know they were pissed off.
They had a break for like fucking 25 years.

1616
01:40:58.481 --> 01:41:01.870
They had a break.
They sold 164,000 tickets,

1617
01:41:01.871 --> 01:41:06.520
but the crowd estimated size was 550,000.
Okay.
Well Shit,
I was too short.

1618
01:41:07.310 --> 01:41:12.110
It's 200,000 short.
Yeah.
Yeah,
because the rest rush the gate,

1619
01:41:13.260 --> 01:41:15.340
they took the fence and you know,

1620
01:41:15.740 --> 01:41:20.230
took it down and they just fucking rolled rolled on me.
I would imagine.
Yeah,
it,

1621
01:41:20.250 --> 01:41:23.410
it,
you know,
cause when it's an event that everybody wants to get to,

1622
01:41:23.411 --> 01:41:25.840
they're going to find a way to it and it's outside.

1623
01:41:25.900 --> 01:41:30.100
It's outside with those numbers,
man.
That's just,
you can't stop that.

1624
01:41:30.140 --> 01:41:34.510
I'm no it,
you know,
it's,
it's a great part of their history because I mean,

1625
01:41:34.511 --> 01:41:39.220
you know,
that one was a good one where no one got hurt,

1626
01:41:39.480 --> 01:41:44.350
knows no crazy,
uh,
no crazy shit happening.
Like the next one after that.

1627
01:41:44.351 --> 01:41:47.710
I mean they had,
so what happened to the next one?
Uh,
well shit,

1628
01:41:47.711 --> 01:41:49.650
they had a bunch of,
uh,

1629
01:41:49.660 --> 01:41:54.000
women say that they had gotten raped or molested at um,
at the,

1630
01:41:54.190 --> 01:41:58.150
at the one the following year.
Um,
and uh,

1631
01:41:58.151 --> 01:42:00.360
it was fires and shit at the end and then there was fires.

1632
01:42:00.361 --> 01:42:04.720
There was a whole bunch of people lost their fucking mind and they had some

1633
01:42:04.721 --> 01:42:08.620
great bands too.
So you know it,
they don't do that anymore.
Right.

1634
01:42:08.670 --> 01:42:12.880
What stocks know that they're doing it at enough.
What are you doing?

1635
01:42:12.881 --> 01:42:17.110
You fucking idiots move,
sell your house and do something.

1636
01:42:17.140 --> 01:42:20.570
And it's crazy though,
cause there's a fire is holy shit man.
Yeah.

1637
01:42:20.580 --> 01:42:21.780
They had bonfires.
Yeah.

1638
01:42:21.790 --> 01:42:26.790
Believe when get corn went on it was either limp biscuit or corn and the fires

1639
01:42:28.060 --> 01:42:29.080
just fucking started.

1640
01:42:29.110 --> 01:42:31.810
People were pissed too cause they were charging so much for water and like they

1641
01:42:31.811 --> 01:42:33.970
couldn't,
they couldn't get to the bathrooms.
Like you're asking,

1642
01:42:33.971 --> 01:42:36.870
like they didn't have the facilities set up as well.
Yeah.

1643
01:42:36.900 --> 01:42:41.220
They didn't have adequate facilities for what,
what the fuck was popping to mean,

1644
01:42:41.230 --> 01:42:43.750
you know,
uh,
you know,
a spouse,
Christ,

1645
01:42:43.840 --> 01:42:46.090
look at the fucking wood it looks like after it's over.

1646
01:42:46.120 --> 01:42:50.490
Listen to thousand Andy Gumps for 500,000 people is nothing

1647
01:42:52.030 --> 01:42:56.050
you imagined you need like 10,000.
He can imagine being the dude.

1648
01:42:56.051 --> 01:42:58.990
It gets in there up to 5,000.
I mean,
look,
it's taking a shit.

1649
01:42:58.991 --> 01:43:02.710
They totally took over the fucking the highway.
Right?
They're crazy.

1650
01:43:02.710 --> 01:43:06.670
They shut down the fucking highway.
They just parked their cars.
Yeah,

1651
01:43:06.671 --> 01:43:09.780
they made the highway.
The park is crazy.
Look at that.

1652
01:43:10.120 --> 01:43:14.770
At least it was kind of orderly.
Like maybe they sort of sort of,
they shut down.

1653
01:43:14.771 --> 01:43:18.700
I'll tell you this though.
They weren't cold blooded.
Um,
the,
the organizers,

1654
01:43:18.750 --> 01:43:19.583
because

1655
01:43:24.550 --> 01:43:27.880
these guys had some fucking Moxy,
I'll tell you that.
Hey listen,
you know,

1656
01:43:27.881 --> 01:43:30.610
after every band was done with their set,

1657
01:43:30.970 --> 01:43:35.110
they expected you to leave right away because the next wave of bands was coming

1658
01:43:35.530 --> 01:43:39.550
and they were getting your spot.
So like if you had a dressing room,

1659
01:43:39.580 --> 01:43:42.970
once you're set was done,
you were expected to get the fuck out.

1660
01:43:43.120 --> 01:43:46.120
So you had a helicopter out of there.
If,
if,
yeah,

1661
01:43:46.121 --> 01:43:49.390
it was best if you did because if you didn't take the ride when,
when,

1662
01:43:49.510 --> 01:43:52.490
when you were supposed to,
you are getting stuck there.

1663
01:43:53.150 --> 01:43:56.900
They couldn't guarantee that they could give you the ride back to your shit

1664
01:43:57.020 --> 01:43:57.980
after that,
you know,

1665
01:43:57.981 --> 01:44:01.730
because they had all the other bands to think of and they might not have room

1666
01:44:01.731 --> 01:44:05.270
for you when they take the other bands.
So it was like,
yeah,

1667
01:44:05.380 --> 01:44:08.590
<v 4>get that fucking Fisher.
Yup.</v>

1668
01:44:08.920 --> 01:44:12.220
Oh my God,
look,
it looks like,

1669
01:44:14.160 --> 01:44:17.920
like the stage,
right.
That's insane.

1670
01:44:17.921 --> 01:44:19.720
That picture is insane.

1671
01:44:19.770 --> 01:44:23.610
<v 1>Yeah,
it was.
That's,
that's the one I'll remember the most.
I mean we've,</v>

1672
01:44:23.611 --> 01:44:27.330
we've done some huge gigs,
but like that one by far,
you know,

1673
01:44:27.750 --> 01:44:32.750
never have we played for another 500,000 you know us sound like 500,000 people

1674
01:44:35.041 --> 01:44:37.320
screen.
Much like that Viking chant.

1675
01:44:40.950 --> 01:44:42.750
<v 4>I mean we had a small nation right there.</v>

1676
01:44:43.450 --> 01:44:48.450
<v 1>Graziel legitimately like when you leave there and then you go do a regular gig</v>

1677
01:44:48.491 --> 01:44:52.900
afterwards.
Does it feel weird?
He,
well,
it,

1678
01:44:52.960 --> 01:44:57.520
it depends,
but yeah,
adjusting.
It does take some adjusting,
you know,

1679
01:44:57.521 --> 01:45:01.030
especially if the next Gig isn't as hype as that you're like,
fuck,

1680
01:45:01.031 --> 01:45:02.170
we just came from Woodstock.

1681
01:45:03.460 --> 01:45:08.410
But fortunately the smaller gigs that we had after that,

1682
01:45:08.530 --> 01:45:11.170
you know,
in terms of playing festivals,
they were like,
you know,

1683
01:45:11.830 --> 01:45:15.910
in between 30,000,
seventy thousand two hundred thousand and we felt it.

1684
01:45:15.940 --> 01:45:20.650
That gave us such an experience that we can handle any fucking stage.

1685
01:45:21.040 --> 01:45:24.940
So it became easier for us to do festivals after that.

1686
01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:30.310
And the reaction that we would get at these festivals were smaller versions of

1687
01:45:30.580 --> 01:45:33.730
what we did there,
you know?
And uh,
it was,

1688
01:45:33.731 --> 01:45:36.660
it was a great experience because we had,
we had been doing like a,

1689
01:45:36.661 --> 01:45:38.920
a couple of European festivals before that,

1690
01:45:39.250 --> 01:45:43.750
so it sort of prepared us for that.
But we didn't,
we didn't,

1691
01:45:44.290 --> 01:45:48.900
I mean,
the fucking numbers we were definitely not prepared for were like,
Whoa,

1692
01:45:48.910 --> 01:45:52.810
what the fuck?
That's like,
that transcends reality.
Yeah.
I mean,

1693
01:45:53.590 --> 01:45:58.090
listen,
we know that that's not our show.
They're not all there for us.
You know,

1694
01:45:58.091 --> 01:45:59.620
cause it's a mixed bag,
right.

1695
01:45:59.890 --> 01:46:04.320
Bunch of different artists and you're winning over people.
If anything you're,

1696
01:46:04.321 --> 01:46:06.520
you're,
you're,
you're there playing for your,
your,

1697
01:46:06.521 --> 01:46:08.710
your base of people that might have come to see you,

1698
01:46:09.190 --> 01:46:13.480
but you're winning everybody else over if you're doing it right.
And,
uh,

1699
01:46:13.510 --> 01:46:17.920
for us it was like a victory because we saw,
you know,

1700
01:46:18.040 --> 01:46:21.760
half a million people up there jumping up and down to all our shit and they knew

1701
01:46:21.761 --> 01:46:26.170
the words and they were singing with us in it,
you know,
it was like a,

1702
01:46:26.700 --> 01:46:29.650
a big notch under the belt and a boost for our confidence,

1703
01:46:29.651 --> 01:46:31.630
knowing that we can get in front of anybody,

1704
01:46:31.631 --> 01:46:36.040
play with anyone and get that reaction.
I mean,

1705
01:46:36.041 --> 01:46:39.090
because after that,
you know,
we were getting booked on metal,
um,

1706
01:46:39.160 --> 01:46:43.150
driven festivals and stuff where we're the only hip hop on it,

1707
01:46:43.240 --> 01:46:47.020
but it's all straight up metal.
I mean we were playing shows,
um,

1708
01:46:47.830 --> 01:46:52.530
co headlining under Metallica,
right?
Metallica,
Cypress Hill,

1709
01:46:52.980 --> 01:46:57.600
um,
uh,
biohazard,
Deftones fear factory in,

1710
01:46:57.601 --> 01:46:59.310
in all of that stuff.
You know what I mean?

1711
01:46:59.311 --> 01:47:04.311
And we'd be in that mix playing those festivals with those guys and with hip hop

1712
01:47:05.191 --> 01:47:09.900
music and you know,
the boost did,
it gave us in the confidence,
it was like,

1713
01:47:09.901 --> 01:47:12.180
fuck that we can play with any of these motherfuckers.

1714
01:47:12.181 --> 01:47:13.630
It doesn't matter who it is.
And,

1715
01:47:14.070 --> 01:47:17.890
and we went to those metal metal festivals with our hip hop in,

1716
01:47:17.891 --> 01:47:22.500
got metal reaction,
mosh pits,
stage dives,

1717
01:47:22.501 --> 01:47:24.120
everything what,
you know,
and,

1718
01:47:24.121 --> 01:47:28.770
and it felt good to be able to hang up there with Metallica.
I mean,
yeah,

1719
01:47:29.160 --> 01:47:32.550
what they do to a crowd is crazy.

1720
01:47:33.300 --> 01:47:36.870
But we realized that if we were playing on the same venue going before them,

1721
01:47:37.110 --> 01:47:39.120
we can in a festival form,

1722
01:47:39.870 --> 01:47:43.680
we can fucking hang with anyone.
And,
and uh,
that's,

1723
01:47:43.681 --> 01:47:48.200
that pretty much put us over the top with doing festivals.
Like,
yeah,
we're,

1724
01:47:48.340 --> 01:47:50.910
we're going to fucking rule this shit.
People are going to have to,

1725
01:47:51.330 --> 01:47:54.720
people are going to have to up their game when we're on that festival with them.

1726
01:47:54.721 --> 01:47:55.770
That's the way we took it.

1727
01:47:55.900 --> 01:47:58.560
And I would imagine you couldn't sleep for days after that chair.

1728
01:47:58.740 --> 01:48:01.230
The adrenaline was crazy.
I got to tell you,

1729
01:48:01.231 --> 01:48:04.060
the adrenaline was crazy and then you're in the helicopter leaving.

1730
01:48:04.080 --> 01:48:07.530
Will you like what the fuck just happened?
Yeah,
we were,
we were tripping out man.

1731
01:48:07.531 --> 01:48:10.440
I mean,
we were like totally in awe of,

1732
01:48:10.530 --> 01:48:15.330
of the response that we got and the,
the,
the,
you know,

1733
01:48:15.331 --> 01:48:19.350
the enormity of the fucking crowd man.
I mean,
it was fucking huge.

1734
01:48:19.351 --> 01:48:21.510
Is to be a part of something.
That's that,
I mean,

1735
01:48:21.511 --> 01:48:24.240
that's like something that no one there is ever going to forget.

1736
01:48:24.270 --> 01:48:27.600
We took it for granted.
I've got to tell you when we fucking,
they'll,
well,

1737
01:48:27.601 --> 01:48:31.290
they want you to do well.
Okay,
we'll do Woodstock,
whatever.
And,
and,
and uh,

1738
01:48:31.980 --> 01:48:36.210
when we got there,
that's when we saw just how fucking crazy it was.

1739
01:48:36.211 --> 01:48:39.270
I think this yet seen you'll,
they steal your shoes.

1740
01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:41.880
They're going to start coming to watch.

1741
01:48:42.300 --> 01:48:45.450
I have to hold my shirt forward so they don't get choked out.

1742
01:48:46.200 --> 01:48:49.210
And there goes,
there goes the first shoes.

1743
01:48:50.250 --> 01:48:51.440
Not to take that first one.

1744
01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:56.130
What were you thinking when they were taking shit like damn.
I was like,
Oh fuck.

1745
01:48:56.131 --> 01:49:00.800
There goes one shoe,
there goes all white sock.
She,
yeah,

1746
01:49:00.820 --> 01:49:05.820
that goes the other so ridiculous and there is no fucking security that can stop

1747
01:49:06.721 --> 01:49:10.260
500,000 people save all that shit.
No,

1748
01:49:10.261 --> 01:49:12.730
you're at the mercy of the fans so,

1749
01:49:13.240 --> 01:49:15.220
but he's going to grab from my sock pretty soon.

1750
01:49:15.240 --> 01:49:19.200
That is so wild and is stealing socks.
Look at it.
It's still your pants.

1751
01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:21.630
Hey listen.
You know they,
they,

1752
01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:24.720
they tried in big grab your Dick now that you know,

1753
01:49:24.780 --> 01:49:29.250
they tried to grab the weed in my pocket cause that sometimes you know,

1754
01:49:29.251 --> 01:49:32.160
when your adrenaline is kicking you're not really thinking,

1755
01:49:32.220 --> 01:49:35.580
you know what's in my pocket and shit like that.
But yeah.
You know,

1756
01:49:35.610 --> 01:49:40.090
throughout the,
I had chicks trying to grab my shit for sure.
Of course.
The,

1757
01:49:40.100 --> 01:49:43.500
sure that was a little crazy for me,
you know?

1758
01:49:43.501 --> 01:49:48.010
But it is what it is.
If you're going to stand close.
Yeah.
You know,

1759
01:49:48.310 --> 01:49:51.580
Shit like this happens,
right?
I mean if you're going to stage dive,

1760
01:49:51.610 --> 01:49:55.600
you got to assume some weird shit is going to happen.
Yeah.
I mean for me,

1761
01:49:55.601 --> 01:49:57.970
you know,
people were mostly respectful,
you know,

1762
01:49:57.971 --> 01:50:01.780
but they would go through my pockets to see if I had weed in one.

1763
01:50:01.870 --> 01:50:04.310
One didn't have any or your pockets.
Yeah,
I did.
I had some,

1764
01:50:04.480 --> 01:50:08.170
I had like an ounce of weed and one at one show and I jumped in and I totally

1765
01:50:08.171 --> 01:50:11.580
forgot I had it in my pocket.
Boom.
If I can took my goddamn week.

1766
01:50:13.060 --> 01:50:17.440
Hope you enjoyed that.
I bet they did.
Actually.
They did their role in that joint.

1767
01:50:17.441 --> 01:50:21.550
This is be real and weed man.
I know they do in California.

1768
01:50:21.551 --> 01:50:25.090
This is the real shit.
Yeah.
California.

1769
01:50:25.091 --> 01:50:28.720
We to this day still holds up.
I mean,
you got some good Colorado.
We,

1770
01:50:28.730 --> 01:50:33.640
there's some good weed all over the country,
but oh,
Swede is,
it's like,
okay.

1771
01:50:34.120 --> 01:50:38.560
It's okay.
Other places Rato and California and then the rest is kind of,

1772
01:50:38.590 --> 01:50:41.920
Seattle's got real good weed.
Seattle actually blow your fucking mind.

1773
01:50:41.950 --> 01:50:45.220
They'll blow your mind.
Yeah.
I gotta say Oregon.
They'll blow your mind.

1774
01:50:45.520 --> 01:50:49.690
People have stepped up,
they're still behind California.
And you know,

1775
01:50:49.691 --> 01:50:54.250
in terms of how much good weed there is here,
like,
I mean,

1776
01:50:54.430 --> 01:50:57.940
there's so much,
you know,
from north to south and in central cow,

1777
01:50:58.570 --> 01:51:02.380
there's so many different strains that are fucking good,
right?

1778
01:51:03.190 --> 01:51:06.760
You go to other places and they have a few strains that are good,

1779
01:51:07.060 --> 01:51:09.530
but that's because they're still,
you know,

1780
01:51:09.910 --> 01:51:13.240
they're still trying to catch up in terms of knowledge and cultivation and stuff

1781
01:51:13.241 --> 01:51:18.010
like that in,
in,
in how to make this trains that they have,
you know,

1782
01:51:18.190 --> 01:51:21.820
maximize the flavor in,
in,
in the high and all that stuff.

1783
01:51:22.510 --> 01:51:26.350
Some of caught up and some are still lagging a little bit behind.

1784
01:51:26.440 --> 01:51:30.010
But I gotta tell you,
man,
when this last trip I just had to Vancouver,

1785
01:51:30.011 --> 01:51:34.210
I was just there,
um,
for four 20.
And uh,

1786
01:51:34.600 --> 01:51:39.580
they had some shit that California boys would be like,

1787
01:51:39.581 --> 01:51:42.440
Yo,
this is fire right here.
You know,

1788
01:51:42.790 --> 01:51:47.410
they had a animal cookies that were really good wedding cake,
which is a strain.

1789
01:51:47.411 --> 01:51:51.330
It's popular here in Cali,
you know,
via the jungle boys and,

1790
01:51:51.331 --> 01:51:54.570
and a burner and stuff like that.
When they were,

1791
01:51:54.571 --> 01:51:59.530
when they were working together on exotics and uh,
and they also had this,

1792
01:51:59.590 --> 01:52:04.590
this joint called black diamond and try octane and all of them men,

1793
01:52:05.230 --> 01:52:07.810
I got to say all of them burn suite.

1794
01:52:07.830 --> 01:52:12.730
They tasted good that that white ash did.
People are looking for.
Now,

1795
01:52:12.790 --> 01:52:16.990
you know,
people think,
you know,
when they see white ash,
it's the purist,

1796
01:52:17.580 --> 01:52:22.240
um,
news flash.
Even if it has a little bit of black ash,
it's still,
you know,

1797
01:52:22.241 --> 01:52:27.160
there's still,
you know,
people clean,
flush their roots,

1798
01:52:27.161 --> 01:52:29.890
you know what I mean?
It's just,
it,
some of the nutrients,

1799
01:52:29.920 --> 01:52:33.100
if you're using salts as your nutrients,
you know,

1800
01:52:33.101 --> 01:52:35.950
which most people are these days,
your ash comes out.

1801
01:52:35.951 --> 01:52:40.540
Like if you're using nutrients that are already pre made like an advanced

1802
01:52:40.541 --> 01:52:43.900
nutrients in the others,
sometimes you know,

1803
01:52:43.901 --> 01:52:47.660
you might have a little bit of black ash because some of the components into

1804
01:52:47.661 --> 01:52:50.150
those nutrients doesn't mean it's not clean.

1805
01:52:50.210 --> 01:52:54.980
It just looks prettier when it's white.
But anyway,
these guys,
their shit,

1806
01:52:55.220 --> 01:53:00.220
all white ash and the taste was fucking beautiful in the high was definitely

1807
01:53:00.921 --> 01:53:05.060
there.
And I say,
guys in Vancouver,
man,
they,
they have stepped up.

1808
01:53:05.160 --> 01:53:08.580
<v 0>Oh,
well they've been running,
we'd through Vancouver for a long time.</v>

1809
01:53:08.581 --> 01:53:11.010
Do you ever say that?
What,
what is Adam's gorgeous documentary?

1810
01:53:11.011 --> 01:53:13.680
He had the culture high and then before that there was another one,

1811
01:53:14.160 --> 01:53:19.160
the documentary that was all about uncovering how much of Vancouver's entire

1812
01:53:20.131 --> 01:53:24.390
economy is based on marijuana.
And if he pulled it out,
like when they talk about,

1813
01:53:24.610 --> 01:53:28.710
uh,
the union,
that's it.
The business mind getting high.
Um,
when,

1814
01:53:29.490 --> 01:53:33.210
if you pulled weed out of Vancouver,
you took it out of their economy,

1815
01:53:33.211 --> 01:53:35.400
their economy would essentially collapse.
Yeah.
I mean,

1816
01:53:35.401 --> 01:53:39.480
it's responsible for so many people being wealthy up there.
And it's,
so it was,

1817
01:53:39.660 --> 01:53:44.550
now it's 100% legal throughout the entire country.
Yeah.
But back then in 2007,

1818
01:53:44.551 --> 01:53:49.320
I was in that documentary.
That was 12 years ago.
It was just tolerated.

1819
01:53:49.400 --> 01:53:52.590
It was weirdly tolerated where it wasn't legal,

1820
01:53:52.770 --> 01:53:56.490
but they didn't ever arrest anybody for it.
But there was a lot of gangsters,

1821
01:53:56.491 --> 01:53:58.200
a lot of hell's angels were involved.

1822
01:53:58.201 --> 01:54:02.320
A lot of dudes were selling weed and they had flashy diamond colored watt

1823
01:54:02.340 --> 01:54:05.370
covered watches and shit.
There was a lot of that shit.
Yeah.

1824
01:54:05.800 --> 01:54:09.130
<v 1>Yeah.
You know,
it's still sort of,
um,
I mean,
you know,
listen,</v>

1825
01:54:09.131 --> 01:54:12.220
the black market's always going to be,
you know,
anywhere.

1826
01:54:12.970 --> 01:54:17.970
Especially right now that the taxes are so high to buy cannabis and to grow it

1827
01:54:18.551 --> 01:54:22.030
and all that stuff,
everything did involves it.
It's pretty expensive right now.

1828
01:54:22.031 --> 01:54:25.310
So they're encouraging organized crime,
right.
In a certain way.
Yeah.

1829
01:54:25.420 --> 01:54:29.350
Which my point was,
you know,
when the corporations come in,

1830
01:54:29.440 --> 01:54:34.420
that shit comes down and then the black market has a bigger problem at that

1831
01:54:34.421 --> 01:54:38.680
point because then prices of cannabis will come down.
Um,

1832
01:54:39.160 --> 01:54:43.420
but you know,
it's always going to exist in,
in,
you know,

1833
01:54:43.840 --> 01:54:46.270
we sort of went through the same thing when,

1834
01:54:46.271 --> 01:54:50.710
when to 15 came about here in California where it was,
you know,

1835
01:54:50.740 --> 01:54:53.650
cops didn't know what the fuck to do when they caught you with it.

1836
01:54:53.680 --> 01:54:58.150
They didn't want to do anything,
you know,
because they knew as well as we were,

1837
01:54:58.151 --> 01:54:59.710
this shit is eventually going to be legal.

1838
01:54:59.710 --> 01:55:03.850
They don't want to be wasting their time and putting people in jail for,

1839
01:55:04.090 --> 01:55:06.050
for cannabis because you know,

1840
01:55:06.100 --> 01:55:10.270
there's other people that need to be in jail for real,
for real crimes.
Um,

1841
01:55:10.690 --> 01:55:12.640
but um,
yeah,

1842
01:55:12.641 --> 01:55:17.641
I think what's happening in Vancouver now is that now that it's legal,

1843
01:55:17.740 --> 01:55:20.330
yeah,
people are still making money and they're still,
you know,

1844
01:55:20.350 --> 01:55:22.440
they're still on top of the game,
but it's,
it's,

1845
01:55:22.960 --> 01:55:25.750
it's harder to make the money right now.
Well at least,

1846
01:55:25.900 --> 01:55:29.020
well maybe not for Canada because it's federally legal,

1847
01:55:29.440 --> 01:55:32.710
but you still got to jump through a number of hoops,
you know,

1848
01:55:32.711 --> 01:55:37.711
in terms of regulation and fines and fees and shit like that to operate,

1849
01:55:39.100 --> 01:55:43.680
you know,
and they're a little bit different than ours.
Obviously we're not,

1850
01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:48.420
ours isn't like federal yet.
But,
uh,
I mean,
you know,

1851
01:55:48.540 --> 01:55:50.730
from what they were saying is that like,
you know,

1852
01:55:50.731 --> 01:55:54.270
in a few years all these companies will be making a whole lot of money.

1853
01:55:54.270 --> 01:55:58.500
Right now they're making money,
but it's basically about survival.

1854
01:55:58.501 --> 01:56:02.760
Getting past a certain time when all the,

1855
01:56:03.150 --> 01:56:04.200
all the legislation,

1856
01:56:04.201 --> 01:56:07.230
all the rules and all the regulations are finally set in place and they're not

1857
01:56:07.231 --> 01:56:12.060
going to change from year to year.
Like they,
like they have been.
So,
you know,

1858
01:56:12.270 --> 01:56:12.421
well,

1859
01:56:12.421 --> 01:56:15.180
Denver had a real weird for a while where they weren't allowed to use banks.

1860
01:56:15.390 --> 01:56:19.650
Yeah.
You know,
like us right now here in Cali,
we can't use banks.
Yeah.

1861
01:56:19.651 --> 01:56:23.760
What did they do with it?
So they see,
can they use credit cards here?

1862
01:56:24.240 --> 01:56:27.410
They used to be able to,
yeah,
you can use credit cards.
Um,

1863
01:56:27.990 --> 01:56:31.350
but realistically it's,
it's if you're making money from,

1864
01:56:31.560 --> 01:56:36.560
from cannabis in terms of if you're a cultivator or you're a or whatever,

1865
01:56:36.871 --> 01:56:39.210
if you're a business entity in the cannabis world,

1866
01:56:39.840 --> 01:56:44.550
they won't take your money if they know it's coming from the cannabis cannabis

1867
01:56:44.551 --> 01:56:49.470
culture.
Right.
But,
you know,
in the last,
in the last two months,
they've,
you know,

1868
01:56:49.710 --> 01:56:53.070
Forbes just put out a story about that the federal government is going to stout

1869
01:56:53.130 --> 01:56:56.130
start allowing banks to,
uh,

1870
01:56:56.760 --> 01:57:00.560
to allow banking in the cannabis and the cannabis stock going anywhere.

1871
01:57:00.600 --> 01:57:02.940
They'd be crazy to not,
you're just leaving money on the table.

1872
01:57:02.941 --> 01:57:04.830
You're leaving a whole lot of money on the table.

1873
01:57:04.890 --> 01:57:09.520
California considers plan to encourage marijuana banking.
Yes.
And that,

1874
01:57:09.740 --> 01:57:11.810
and that just came out yesterday.
You know,

1875
01:57:11.880 --> 01:57:15.780
the Forbes story came out like maybe last week or something,
but this is,

1876
01:57:16.080 --> 01:57:19.050
you know,
one of the residuals of it is it,
you know,

1877
01:57:19.170 --> 01:57:24.170
in places like California that we had problems with banking that is no longer

1878
01:57:25.231 --> 01:57:29.910
going to exist.
So now if you needed to expand your business or something,

1879
01:57:29.911 --> 01:57:34.020
you get a business loan now or you can actually put your money in the fucking

1880
01:57:34.021 --> 01:57:34.890
bank,
you know,

1881
01:57:35.280 --> 01:57:39.570
whereas before you had to fucking buy some sort of vault or some shit and keep

1882
01:57:39.571 --> 01:57:41.850
it there.
And uh,
you know,

1883
01:57:42.090 --> 01:57:45.930
obviously that ain't safe because you got pirates out there still to this day

1884
01:57:45.931 --> 01:57:49.200
trying to figure out,
okay where do they keep their money?
Cause it's that bank.

1885
01:57:49.440 --> 01:57:50.580
But when I was in Colorado,

1886
01:57:50.581 --> 01:57:53.420
when it first became legal and they were having a real hard,

1887
01:57:53.520 --> 01:57:55.100
they couldn't use credit cards ever.

1888
01:57:55.110 --> 01:57:58.440
It was all cash and they just had spec ops guys everywhere.

1889
01:57:58.650 --> 01:58:03.650
Bulletproof vests just covered with guns just ready to rock at any moment's

1890
01:58:04.471 --> 01:58:07.230
notice.
And they were worried that they were going to get,
you know,
yeah.

1891
01:58:07.260 --> 01:58:10.710
Someone was going to try to take over the store and take all the money.
Yeah.

1892
01:58:10.711 --> 01:58:14.580
I mean there's still issues that they got to worry about moving into the future

1893
01:58:14.581 --> 01:58:18.270
in terms of transport protection.
Right.
You know,
because throughout,

1894
01:58:18.540 --> 01:58:23.190
throughout the history of doing any sort of business terms of products going

1895
01:58:23.191 --> 01:58:26.010
from one side of the nation to the other,
you know,

1896
01:58:26.011 --> 01:58:30.120
trucks get hijacked a lot for electronics,

1897
01:58:30.121 --> 01:58:32.970
for any sort of goods.
So,
you know,

1898
01:58:32.971 --> 01:58:35.460
when you're transporting cannabis from state to state,

1899
01:58:35.461 --> 01:58:39.150
they're going to have to have that,
you know,
figured out too because there's,

1900
01:58:39.210 --> 01:58:40.860
you know,
people that are going to be trying to,

1901
01:58:41.140 --> 01:58:45.420
those trucks in hitting that into the black market.
You know,
what else is weird?

1902
01:58:45.670 --> 01:58:49.840
There's people that they post up on people's private land and start these,

1903
01:58:49.841 --> 01:58:54.790
grows these grow centers,
put up a garden and people's land.
Like I,

1904
01:58:54.791 --> 01:58:59.791
I've a friend works on a ranch and a in like central California and they were

1905
01:59:00.371 --> 01:59:01.510
uh,
doing this Ron,

1906
01:59:01.511 --> 01:59:05.500
they were checking gates and checking fences for where the cattle are and they

1907
01:59:05.501 --> 01:59:10.000
found like a fucking acre of wheat.
They're like,
what the fuck is this?

1908
01:59:10.001 --> 01:59:13.780
And there was some dudes there,
they had camp grounds set up and shit and yeah,

1909
01:59:13.900 --> 01:59:17.500
it was like they were just,
they were cartel dudes.
They just like set up a spot,

1910
01:59:17.770 --> 01:59:21.700
find a spot set up.
They don't know who fucking owns it and if they,
you know,

1911
01:59:22.180 --> 01:59:25.330
dropped off there,
apparently they,
I think if I remember the story,

1912
01:59:25.331 --> 01:59:29.290
they got the guys and the guys basically explained how it worked,

1913
01:59:29.650 --> 01:59:32.670
that they get dropped off and they get,
you know,
the,

1914
01:59:32.671 --> 01:59:37.240
the leave them with seeds and this and that and then new guys come in every

1915
01:59:37.240 --> 01:59:40.270
couple of weeks or a couple months and they live there and just watch the weed

1916
01:59:40.271 --> 01:59:43.840
until it grows to the point where they can cultivate it and then they move on

1917
01:59:43.841 --> 01:59:46.000
after it's done.
But they just all over the place.

1918
01:59:46.990 --> 01:59:51.610
People find them in like state parks and forests and shit,
like hiking.

1919
01:59:51.850 --> 01:59:54.970
That's why it happens mostly up north and in central countdown here.

1920
01:59:54.971 --> 01:59:55.780
We don't really,

1921
01:59:55.780 --> 02:00:00.250
I mean the way they patrol the state parks is slightly different down here in

1922
02:00:00.251 --> 02:00:02.170
the south.
They'll,
they'll catch that shit.

1923
02:00:02.830 --> 02:00:05.890
That's why they did it at the ranch because it was to hone ranch,

1924
02:00:05.891 --> 02:00:08.140
which is like two to hold ready thousand acres.

1925
02:00:08.460 --> 02:00:12.490
It's a huge place that I believe natives own that,

1926
02:00:13.540 --> 02:00:14.830
that ranch.
Right?
Yeah.

1927
02:00:14.831 --> 02:00:19.300
You can find to this day these stones where they ground up acorns,

1928
02:00:19.420 --> 02:00:22.990
where they have like a little,
like a pivot,
like a hole where the ground it up.

1929
02:00:23.020 --> 02:00:24.140
I took pictures of it and shit.

1930
02:00:24.150 --> 02:00:27.280
It's pretty cool cause you gotta think like that's probably a thousand years
old.

1931
02:00:27.320 --> 02:00:28.060
Yeah.

1932
02:00:28.060 --> 02:00:31.660
Someone who's probably grind in acorns and there a thousand years and years ago.

1933
02:00:32.060 --> 02:00:35.320
Yeah.
I've never been up north to Humboldt.

1934
02:00:35.500 --> 02:00:39.700
I'd never been up to that area.
Oh that it's,
it's uh,
it's unique.

1935
02:00:40.360 --> 02:00:44.980
There's a lot of Nice flavors up there.
Um,
if you're in the glass,

1936
02:00:45.390 --> 02:00:47.440
the,
a lot of good glass blowers out there.

1937
02:00:47.480 --> 02:00:50.300
But that's a long standing weed culture.
Oh yeah.

1938
02:00:50.530 --> 02:00:54.120
I mean that shit is generational right there.
I was like from the 70s.
Yeah,

1939
02:00:54.121 --> 02:00:57.520
I heard about Humboldt in,
I'll tell you man,
you know,

1940
02:00:57.580 --> 02:01:02.470
it is quiet as they've been in this cannabis culture,
you know,

1941
02:01:02.500 --> 02:01:03.530
you would think that that,

1942
02:01:03.550 --> 02:01:06.160
that'd be one place that's like celebrated and whatnot.

1943
02:01:06.970 --> 02:01:10.360
But I mean they still are coming up with,
you know,

1944
02:01:10.361 --> 02:01:14.590
incredible flavors down there,
you know,
in terms of,
uh,
you know,

1945
02:01:14.591 --> 02:01:17.230
breeding certain,
certain,
um,

1946
02:01:17.500 --> 02:01:22.240
certain strains in creating new strains in doing it outside,
you know,

1947
02:01:22.241 --> 02:01:27.100
like with the,
as they call sun grown or,
or a greenhouse,

1948
02:01:27.700 --> 02:01:31.530
you know,
which is not something we do here in the south.
In the south.
We'd,

1949
02:01:31.531 --> 02:01:35.910
we'd do hydro.
It's,
you know,
indoor,
cause we don't have the same type of

1950
02:01:37.440 --> 02:01:40.640
moisture and shit.
Well we don't the space neither,
you know,

1951
02:01:40.641 --> 02:01:45.500
the forest digit and the moisture and uh,
you know,
we have,

1952
02:01:45.530 --> 02:01:48.500
we have insects that would eat those outdoor crops if they're not in a

1953
02:01:48.501 --> 02:01:52.880
greenhouse.
You know what I mean?
Like fruit worms and shit like that up there.

1954
02:01:52.881 --> 02:01:56.480
And you know,
up north after dark,
you know it gets cold.

1955
02:01:56.510 --> 02:02:01.010
So some of those,
those insects can't live in that,
that environment.

1956
02:02:01.280 --> 02:02:05.210
But in the south it doesn't get as cold as it does up there so they can live

1957
02:02:05.211 --> 02:02:07.770
here.
So you know,
if you're going to do a greenhouse,
here you go.

1958
02:02:07.820 --> 02:02:09.200
It's got to be a greenhouse.

1959
02:02:09.230 --> 02:02:13.190
It can't just be outdoor exposed because they will get,

1960
02:02:13.220 --> 02:02:14.540
they will get fucked with for sure.

1961
02:02:14.600 --> 02:02:18.110
Those photos that I've seen of that area is everything so fucking green.

1962
02:02:18.150 --> 02:02:21.380
That's crazy.
It's like Seattle almost.
Yeah,
it's awesome,
man.

1963
02:02:21.710 --> 02:02:24.270
We were just there not too long ago.
Plan to show up and you

1964
02:02:26.840 --> 02:02:31.150
look at that guy,
the middle of this forest of we on a hillside.
No,

1965
02:02:31.151 --> 02:02:35.210
unless you know that even a flat ground and he's just,
he got it going.
Yeah.

1966
02:02:35.211 --> 02:02:39.050
That looks like he's just in the woods.
He just started growing it in the woods.

1967
02:02:39.051 --> 02:02:42.380
That's crazy.
Wow.
I bet it has a different feel to it.
Right?

1968
02:02:42.381 --> 02:02:47.080
It's always out there with nature.
I mean,
I think it's strong hippie too.

1969
02:02:47.120 --> 02:02:47.751
Hippy dippy.

1970
02:02:47.751 --> 02:02:51.380
But I would think that something that lives in nature with all those other trees

1971
02:02:51.381 --> 02:02:55.130
and shits communicating with those trees.
Oh yeah.
I would think so.

1972
02:02:55.370 --> 02:02:58.610
You'll probably get more of like a natural feel for the weed.
Yeah,

1973
02:02:58.630 --> 02:03:00.920
they're probably deer.
Damn.

1974
02:03:00.980 --> 02:03:04.940
Look at the weed plant like they fucking bushes.
Jesus Christ.

1975
02:03:05.110 --> 02:03:07.820
40 black tail right there.
Columbia black tail.

1976
02:03:08.340 --> 02:03:12.770
It's a big deer and there's a big fear part of the probably eat the weed.

1977
02:03:13.080 --> 02:03:18.050
Probably probably healthy as fuck.
I mean if he's eating the seeds and shit easy.

1978
02:03:18.060 --> 02:03:21.380
Yeah,
probably fertilizing some of that shit out there.

1979
02:03:21.500 --> 02:03:23.670
For the longest time we used to have to get,
you know,
I'm,

1980
02:03:23.671 --> 02:03:27.830
I'm one of the owners of on it and when we made hemp protein we just have to buy

1981
02:03:27.831 --> 02:03:31.430
or shift from Canada.
It was so stupid.
I was like,
this is so ridiculous.

1982
02:03:31.700 --> 02:03:35.840
You have to buy a hamp from another country.
Bring into this country stupid.

1983
02:03:36.090 --> 02:03:39.880
Well that's going to change for sure.
Yes.
That's got to change.
I mean for,

1984
02:03:40.010 --> 02:03:42.560
for everything,
for clothing,
even building houses,

1985
02:03:42.561 --> 02:03:46.040
you ever see that hempcrete that that shit they make.
It's like a camp concrete.

1986
02:03:46.100 --> 02:03:49.880
Yeah,
it's crazy.
Lighter.
It's better.
It's got better insulation values.

1987
02:03:49.881 --> 02:03:50.960
It's harder to burn.

1988
02:03:51.020 --> 02:03:55.010
This is the type of shit that jacker rare was trying to tell people in emperor

1989
02:03:55.011 --> 02:03:57.290
wearing the emperor wears no clothes.

1990
02:03:57.480 --> 02:04:00.980
No daily was all this stuff that we use today.

1991
02:04:01.940 --> 02:04:06.740
Hemp can be,
you know,
the,
the alternative at a cheaper cost,
including plastic,

1992
02:04:07.100 --> 02:04:08.810
biodegradable plastic.

1993
02:04:09.020 --> 02:04:11.450
All these people that are worried about plastic bottles and everything,

1994
02:04:11.480 --> 02:04:14.180
how bad they are for the environment.
Hamp bottles.

1995
02:04:14.181 --> 02:04:17.590
You could make plastic at a hemp and it would be biodegradable.
Yeah.

1996
02:04:18.020 --> 02:04:19.070
It sounds like horse shit.

1997
02:04:19.071 --> 02:04:22.400
There's so many things that you could do with weed that it sounds like you're

1998
02:04:22.401 --> 02:04:25.070
making things.
It sounds like you're making it up,
but it's actual,

1999
02:04:25.100 --> 02:04:29.780
it's actual fact.
Yeah.
And Dude,
over the last like couple of months,

2000
02:04:29.781 --> 02:04:32.120
I've been fucking around pretty heavily with CBD.

2001
02:04:32.121 --> 02:04:36.470
Like every day I've been taking this,
this is a,
it's a one in one.

2002
02:04:36.471 --> 02:04:40.650
It's 10 of CBD,
10 milligrams of Thc.
I take this,
that's,

2003
02:04:40.730 --> 02:04:44.970
that's the perfect one.
One in the afternoon.
Ooh.
All Day long.

2004
02:04:45.920 --> 02:04:50.850
All full of don't give a fuck juice.
Just
we all need that.

2005
02:04:51.870 --> 02:04:56.190
Awesome.
That's an interesting time.
Yeah.
You know,

2006
02:04:56.191 --> 02:05:01.170
for someone who was,
you know,
used to have to hide it before.
Yeah.
In,
you know,

2007
02:05:01.171 --> 02:05:03.600
that's the beauty of it now is it,
you don't have to hide it.

2008
02:05:03.601 --> 02:05:05.490
And people that used to,
you know,

2009
02:05:06.330 --> 02:05:10.560
you got people now that you've never thought were smokers and you know,

2010
02:05:10.561 --> 02:05:14.850
now they're coming out and just being totally free with it.
And that's great man.

2011
02:05:14.851 --> 02:05:19.800
You know,
cause that hap laptop,
what the fuck is that must be a cover but yeah,

2012
02:05:20.880 --> 02:05:22.470
that's pretty cool.
How could it be a cover of,

2013
02:05:22.490 --> 02:05:24.660
it's like the USB ports and everything like that.

2014
02:05:25.080 --> 02:05:27.860
They have those like skin covers.
It could just be a lookalike,

2015
02:05:27.930 --> 02:05:30.120
but it looks like they should make it

2016
02:05:31.780 --> 02:05:36.600
a four time.
It is.
I got to agree.
It is.
It is.

2017
02:05:37.020 --> 02:05:39.930
Well listen brother,
you're a bad motherfucker.
I really appreciate you.

2018
02:05:39.960 --> 02:05:43.710
Thank you brother forever,
for a long time.
So it's cool to get in here and,
uh,

2019
02:05:44.080 --> 02:05:48.830
when a hot boxes to get in that smoke box and people have been asking for you

2020
02:05:48.840 --> 02:05:52.890
for a long time.
I got to,
and,
and I say this,
you know,
in some of the,

2021
02:05:52.950 --> 02:05:55.920
some of the smoke boxes,
you know,
like,
Eh,
cause it's the real his shit.

2022
02:05:55.920 --> 02:05:59.060
Like we just had Mike Tyson in there,
you know.
And um,

2023
02:05:59.700 --> 02:06:01.700
how weird is it to smoke weed with?
My title was,
I,

2024
02:06:01.710 --> 02:06:03.540
I've smoked with them before and,
and I,

2025
02:06:03.541 --> 02:06:07.470
I've smoked it with him on a couple set separate occasions aside from there.

2026
02:06:07.471 --> 02:06:11.880
But one of the places that I smoked with him was at that fucking Leo Machida

2027
02:06:11.881 --> 02:06:15.630
Rashad Evans fight when we all left,
you know,
after the fight,

2028
02:06:16.110 --> 02:06:21.110
we were sort of a getting to our cars and he ran into me and my partner Kenji

2029
02:06:21.510 --> 02:06:24.360
and we were smoking if that one right there and you know,
they'd be real

2030
02:06:26.740 --> 02:06:31.560
well,
is that all right?
Fuck yeah.
Champion.
Here you go.
And,
and um,
you know,

2031
02:06:31.830 --> 02:06:33.300
we always knew he smoked out.

2032
02:06:33.600 --> 02:06:37.140
What was crazy about this interview real quick that did,
I'll say it like,

2033
02:06:37.141 --> 02:06:39.540
cause you asked me this in this interview,

2034
02:06:39.541 --> 02:06:42.070
like what did you do for the anxieties before?
Like,
you know,

2035
02:06:42.071 --> 02:06:44.700
let's say you were going to go on stager,
do the shit.
Right.

2036
02:06:44.701 --> 02:06:48.930
So I asked him that similar question.
I said,
you know,
as artists,

2037
02:06:48.931 --> 02:06:53.610
as athletes will before we're going to go do our thing in front of a mass amount

2038
02:06:53.611 --> 02:06:57.900
of people,
you get this nervous energy,
what did you do to,
you know,

2039
02:06:57.990 --> 02:07:02.400
deal with that?
And he said,
you think it hitting the type before faith?

2040
02:07:03.060 --> 02:07:05.850
Yeah.
You know,
and he was saying how he would,

2041
02:07:06.720 --> 02:07:10.320
the guys that were working with him would,
uh,

2042
02:07:10.740 --> 02:07:14.460
instill these certain words,
like calmness,
you know,

2043
02:07:14.490 --> 02:07:17.620
that would be a reoccurring word that they would do in the hypnosis,

2044
02:07:18.120 --> 02:07:19.860
in hypnotizing them before a fight.

2045
02:07:20.100 --> 02:07:24.870
So that he would always be calm in the fight and never fight desperate and

2046
02:07:24.871 --> 02:07:28.410
always be in control of the situation no matter what happened.

2047
02:07:28.770 --> 02:07:33.750
And that's how he would,
you know,
get that nervous energy down and,
and,
and,
uh,

2048
02:07:34.050 --> 02:07:36.250
be able to fight with such focus.

2049
02:07:36.580 --> 02:07:39.970
But the other interesting thing he said was that he never fought.
I mean,

2050
02:07:39.971 --> 02:07:41.770
he was smoking the whole time,
you know,

2051
02:07:41.771 --> 02:07:45.070
he's a big weed head since he was like 10 years old apparently.

2052
02:07:45.700 --> 02:07:47.830
But he said that he was smoking,
you know,

2053
02:07:48.190 --> 02:07:50.140
but not necessarily when he was training,

2054
02:07:50.800 --> 02:07:53.470
they would give him pharmaceuticals when he was training,
you know,

2055
02:07:53.471 --> 02:07:57.100
shit that he wouldn't feel nothing,
but he didn't have focus.

2056
02:07:57.130 --> 02:08:01.270
What kind of pharmaceuticals?
He said,
uh,
some of it was phentenol,

2057
02:08:01.271 --> 02:08:05.440
some Percocet,
some fentanyl wasn't even around back.
Well,
it's a form of it,

2058
02:08:05.441 --> 02:08:06.810
you know,
like whatever.
Yeah,

2059
02:08:06.811 --> 02:08:10.870
it was an opiate that was whatever the fence and all of that time,
whenever,

2060
02:08:10.871 --> 02:08:12.250
I can't remember what he called it,

2061
02:08:12.251 --> 02:08:15.760
but there was two or three prescription drugs that they would give him it and he

2062
02:08:15.820 --> 02:08:20.440
said he,
he wouldn't feel nothing.
He felt good.
Like there's no pain,
no nothing.

2063
02:08:21.520 --> 02:08:25.120
But the focus that he had was,
was not,

2064
02:08:25.720 --> 02:08:29.830
not there.
Right.
He said that he smoked weed in one fight.

2065
02:08:30.160 --> 02:08:33.230
Mikey smoked weed before one particular fight and,

2066
02:08:33.290 --> 02:08:38.260
and he used the wizard Nader to get through the urine test.
Somehow he fucking,

2067
02:08:39.240 --> 02:08:41.800
he says it in the interview and you know,

2068
02:08:41.801 --> 02:08:45.910
he said that the fight that he had where he was smoked out was with Andrew

2069
02:08:45.910 --> 02:08:46.743
Gelada.

2070
02:08:46.810 --> 02:08:51.810
He said he'd never had so much focus in a fight that it made him realize he

2071
02:08:51.971 --> 02:08:56.530
should have been smoking weed through every God damn fight because he focused on

2072
02:08:56.560 --> 02:09:01.360
everything he was supposed to.
He said he broke his cheek,
he broke his,
uh,

2073
02:09:01.430 --> 02:09:04.540
his cheek here.
Orbital ba broke his orbital.

2074
02:09:04.541 --> 02:09:09.520
He broke a rib and part of his back with a body shots,
Christ.

2075
02:09:09.580 --> 02:09:13.600
And he said,
you know,
that was the fight that was the one and only fight that he,

2076
02:09:13.720 --> 02:09:17.800
you know,
smoked out beforehand.
And Andrew Gelada got,

2077
02:09:18.370 --> 02:09:22.250
he got a flat line.
He,
Andrew go out of left the ring.
He was like,
fuck this.

2078
02:09:22.360 --> 02:09:24.250
And Andrew Gelada had been through wars.

2079
02:09:24.880 --> 02:09:28.000
I mean Riddick both fights were crating Riddick both fights.

2080
02:09:28.090 --> 02:09:32.080
I mean cause Riddick Bowe was really good,
you know,
but he didn't hit like Mike.

2081
02:09:32.140 --> 02:09:35.020
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
I don't think no one hit like Mike,

2082
02:09:35.021 --> 02:09:38.540
if you look at like some of his early training.
Oh crazy legs.

2083
02:09:38.800 --> 02:09:40.390
He was so crazy back then.

2084
02:09:40.990 --> 02:09:44.680
If you look at some of my early training in his footwork,
it's almost like,

2085
02:09:44.880 --> 02:09:47.650
you know,
almost like martial arts based,

2086
02:09:48.070 --> 02:09:53.070
the way that he attacked and then he shifts on his attack and his focused tomato

2087
02:09:53.500 --> 02:09:56.860
custom motto was a master master.
Yeah.

2088
02:09:56.861 --> 02:10:01.780
It wasn't until he switched up and got rid of Kevin Rooney and you know where

2089
02:10:01.781 --> 02:10:05.530
the destruction starts,
how I think it was also his,
you know,

2090
02:10:05.531 --> 02:10:08.530
his life was just too crazy.
It was just too crazy.

2091
02:10:08.531 --> 02:10:12.730
No one can manage that from the time of these 20 to,
you know,

2092
02:10:13.480 --> 02:10:17.860
by the time he retired,
I mean it was probably just a whirlwind of chaos.

2093
02:10:18.010 --> 02:10:21.820
And it's crazy because he realizes that like looking back at it and he says that

2094
02:10:21.821 --> 02:10:24.880
he doesn't train anymore because it awakens a beast.

2095
02:10:24.990 --> 02:10:29.990
And he said that it made me nervous cause it said it cause he said that to you

2096
02:10:30.101 --> 02:10:33.500
too,
right?
Yeah.
Cause that,
cause I was watching you know,

2097
02:10:33.560 --> 02:10:36.170
your interview with them and uh,

2098
02:10:36.260 --> 02:10:39.260
one of our guys that was in the backseat asked him,
Hey,
do you ever train?

2099
02:10:39.261 --> 02:10:42.650
Do you ever like,
you know,
he's like,
Nah,
I don't do that.
No.
Yeah,
he was.

2100
02:10:42.651 --> 02:10:45.950
Every night I get on the treadmill and I do it from running on the treadmill,

2101
02:10:45.951 --> 02:10:46.784
but that fit,

2102
02:10:46.880 --> 02:10:50.030
I would imagine that if he got back and train and he get in shape real quick,

2103
02:10:51.260 --> 02:10:55.190
but you know,
it would awaken a beast.
Yeah.
They're all like,
you can't quit.

2104
02:10:55.191 --> 02:10:59.000
You can't quit.
He's like,
fuck you.
Fuck you.
And rounded.
Just got up and left,

2105
02:10:59.480 --> 02:11:02.450
pushed that guy away.
And he's like,
you're not filling these punches.

2106
02:11:02.570 --> 02:11:07.170
He knew something was wrong.
Well he knew his buzz I bought was broke too.

2107
02:11:08.060 --> 02:11:11.340
Look,
they're trying to put the mouthpiece.
He put it in it's Luva.
Yes.

2108
02:11:11.341 --> 02:11:13.640
Lou Duvel do voters.

2109
02:11:14.420 --> 02:11:17.720
Who is that guy looked like Lou dealer for a second.
Yeah,
he's,
I mean,

2110
02:11:17.721 --> 02:11:21.710
you could tell his fucking face as Busey,
right?
They're fairly normal,

2111
02:11:21.711 --> 02:11:23.750
but I'm sure it felt like shit,
you know,

2112
02:11:23.760 --> 02:11:27.260
like it doesn't swell up real bad until later he listened.
You know,

2113
02:11:27.261 --> 02:11:30.230
if Andrew Gelada,
you know who's been in wars,

2114
02:11:30.590 --> 02:11:34.520
you know with Riddick Bowe and other fighters,
like he was a no slouch.

2115
02:11:35.210 --> 02:11:38.970
If he's telling you I've had enough of this shit,
wow,

2116
02:11:39.180 --> 02:11:40.220
we'll let him go.

2117
02:11:40.600 --> 02:11:44.270
Because he knows once they found out that his back was broken in,

2118
02:11:44.271 --> 02:11:46.790
his face was broken.
They're probably like,
oh,
okay.
Sorry.
Yeah.

2119
02:11:46.791 --> 02:11:47.930
I mean they think about that.

2120
02:11:47.931 --> 02:11:51.620
Here's a corner guy was like trying to put his mouthpiece backend so stupid once

2121
02:11:51.621 --> 02:11:53.780
it got,
doesn't want to fight.
You can't make them fight more.

2122
02:11:54.210 --> 02:11:56.930
It's like he's already flipped that switch inside of his head.

2123
02:11:56.960 --> 02:12:00.560
You know what I told Mike that he didn't realize it.
If this is the last thing,

2124
02:12:00.561 --> 02:12:02.570
cause I know we both got to go,
but I said,

2125
02:12:02.571 --> 02:12:07.370
do you know that all the dudes you fought to get to that title,

2126
02:12:07.400 --> 02:12:11.540
including,
you know the dudes that you know that,
that you took titles from,

2127
02:12:12.050 --> 02:12:14.000
they all stopped fighting after you beat him.

2128
02:12:14.720 --> 02:12:17.510
None of them wanted to come back and get nothing.

2129
02:12:17.511 --> 02:12:20.090
They didn't want no part of that heavyweight title after that.

2130
02:12:20.330 --> 02:12:23.030
He retired so many boxers.
Oh yeah.

2131
02:12:23.031 --> 02:12:27.910
He doesn't even realize that Tony tubs go down the line.
All of them.

2132
02:12:27.970 --> 02:12:29.780
He didn't retire.
Larry Holmes,
Larry Holmes,

2133
02:12:29.781 --> 02:12:33.010
wait until he went to jail and he's like,
I'm going to come back.
Yup.
Yeah.

2134
02:12:33.020 --> 02:12:37.430
That's the only guy.
Bone crusher Smith.
Yup.
Tyrrell bigs.

2135
02:12:38.350 --> 02:12:41.630
Definitely retired to and they were rivals at one point in time.
Yeah.

2136
02:12:41.631 --> 02:12:46.120
He Fuck Tyrrell did pretty good.
Leon Spinks.
Yeah.

2137
02:12:46.280 --> 02:12:50.870
Michael.
Yeah.
He said,
you know what,
I had this title too long.
It's a wrap.
Yeah,

2138
02:12:51.380 --> 02:12:54.650
check please.
And he told me just like,
I think you know what?

2139
02:12:54.651 --> 02:12:57.800
I didn't even realize that.
Yeah,
man know what he did.
He retired.

2140
02:12:57.801 --> 02:13:00.740
A lot of people say we all saw it.
It was a force of nature.

2141
02:13:01.120 --> 02:13:04.460
And I told him the other thing I told him real quick too was,
you know,

2142
02:13:04.461 --> 02:13:08.780
like that explanation that he had on his documentary where he as he's coming to

2143
02:13:08.781 --> 02:13:10.520
the ring,
he knew he had to fight one.

2144
02:13:10.910 --> 02:13:14.780
He could see it in their eyes and then once he steps into the ring,
he's a god,

2145
02:13:14.810 --> 02:13:17.270
they're done right.
And I told him,
you know,

2146
02:13:17.271 --> 02:13:20.310
I was at that Bruce Seldon fight and um,

2147
02:13:21.140 --> 02:13:26.140
I saw exactly what you explained in Bruce Selten Cause Bruce Selden was knocking

2148
02:13:26.751 --> 02:13:30.320
fools out left and right.
He was like a really good heavyweight.

2149
02:13:30.960 --> 02:13:35.250
The minute he got in there with Mikey Fan boyed out tasted that glove.

2150
02:13:36.030 --> 02:13:38.850
Didn't want no more.
Yeah,
it was a experience.

2151
02:13:38.851 --> 02:13:41.400
It wasn't just that you were fighting a guy who knew how to fight,

2152
02:13:41.401 --> 02:13:45.780
but you were fighting Mike Tyson.
It was this idol.
He was this thing,

2153
02:13:45.810 --> 02:13:49.080
this cultural phenomenon he was thought to be at that time everybody was

2154
02:13:49.081 --> 02:13:51.570
thinking he's the greatest heavyweight of all time.
Does it destroyer?

2155
02:13:51.930 --> 02:13:55.800
No one had an answer for him.
You know,
sell didn't sell,
then he pretty much,

2156
02:13:55.801 --> 02:14:00.570
you know,
he was a fan.
That was his idol and he,
he got totally got rocked.

2157
02:14:00.571 --> 02:14:03.720
He was so huge at the time that when buster Douglas beat him,

2158
02:14:03.750 --> 02:14:06.450
even though I knew he beat him,
I watched the fight afterwards.

2159
02:14:06.451 --> 02:14:08.160
I couldn't believe it.
I'm like,
this is,

2160
02:14:08.310 --> 02:14:11.980
he's going to get up and it's Bruce elder.
I look out Jack Bruce Selden was,

2161
02:14:12.350 --> 02:14:15.690
he's a big boy and they're fucking tank.
Yeah.
And he was,

2162
02:14:15.760 --> 02:14:19.980
he was knocking people out and be look 29 nuggets and he was fighting good guys.

2163
02:14:20.040 --> 02:14:24.540
Oh yeah.
Cause the WBA heavyweight champion.
And I followed his career too.

2164
02:14:24.541 --> 02:14:28.170
You know what I mean?
And yeah,
he totally fan boyed out on Mike,
man.
I'm like,

2165
02:14:28.470 --> 02:14:29.840
well look at the stare down.

2166
02:14:29.870 --> 02:14:31.650
We've seen him in the stare down and you look at it that

2167
02:14:34.530 --> 02:14:39.020
it's like,
oh no,
you made a tremendous mistake getting to this mistake.

2168
02:14:39.930 --> 02:14:43.590
Look how much bigger sell didn't is do it.
He's a big boy,
bro.

2169
02:14:43.660 --> 02:14:45.150
It wasn't taken none of that shit.

2170
02:14:45.210 --> 02:14:48.990
Tyson's footwork and his ability to close the distance and Bob and weave and I

2171
02:14:48.991 --> 02:14:51.900
mean it was like there was nobody before him like that.
No Man,

2172
02:14:51.960 --> 02:14:54.750
they'll never be another guy like that.
It's a heavyweight.

2173
02:14:54.810 --> 02:14:59.580
He was just so fast too because realistically the guys who trained him,
yeah,

2174
02:14:59.600 --> 02:15:03.360
they had a certain technique and nobody uses it.
Well,
it was not just dad,

2175
02:15:03.361 --> 02:15:07.640
it was Wa what Mike talked about in the podcast about being hypnotized.
Yeah.

2176
02:15:07.710 --> 02:15:10.320
I mean from the time he was a little boy and you know,

2177
02:15:10.410 --> 02:15:14.910
the fact that he had nothing before that everything was,
his life was shit.

2178
02:15:14.911 --> 02:15:17.100
It was all pain and suffering and poverty.

2179
02:15:17.250 --> 02:15:20.130
And then all of a sudden some guy comes along and rescues him and takes some

2180
02:15:20.131 --> 02:15:24.150
teaches amount of box and then all of a sudden he gets recognition and positive

2181
02:15:24.151 --> 02:15:27.360
feedback and he felt like he was something special.
Boom,

2182
02:15:28.140 --> 02:15:31.800
he fucking hit that canvas Holler.
He didn't want it.

2183
02:15:32.470 --> 02:15:36.270
We kind of forget sometimes what it was like watching those fights to go back

2184
02:15:36.271 --> 02:15:40.200
and watch them now.
I mean there's,
there's amazing fighters right now.
Like the,

2185
02:15:40.250 --> 02:15:44.790
like Terrence Crawford had just won a Saturday night.
Amazing,
amazing boxers.

2186
02:15:45.060 --> 02:15:49.140
But what Mike was,
was something,
he was something completely different.

2187
02:15:49.500 --> 02:15:53.860
It was something that transcended sports.
Everybody wanted to see him fight.

2188
02:15:53.880 --> 02:15:56.520
Do you know if you believed in conspiracy theories?
Right?

2189
02:15:57.570 --> 02:16:00.030
He didn't even hit him right there.
He just fell on purpose.
Right?

2190
02:16:00.360 --> 02:16:03.780
If you believe in conspiracy theories,
right?
You think about it like this,
right?

2191
02:16:03.810 --> 02:16:08.580
Mike was knocking guys out in the first round and people were paying a whole lot

2192
02:16:08.581 --> 02:16:13.020
of money for,
for tickets and paper view.
You know,
when you look at it,

2193
02:16:13.050 --> 02:16:17.490
it looks like they were trying to slow his role and put in a guy like Evander

2194
02:16:17.490 --> 02:16:18.480
Holyfield who was a brawler.

2195
02:16:19.110 --> 02:16:23.400
He could box but he could brawl and take the fight 11 rounds and you know,

2196
02:16:23.401 --> 02:16:27.240
make it a fucking great paper view where Mike would totally ruined the paper.

2197
02:16:27.241 --> 02:16:28.920
Have you had knock your ass out in,
in a,

2198
02:16:29.920 --> 02:16:33.790
and when you look at it the way boxing was for such a long time,

2199
02:16:34.060 --> 02:16:37.520
I wouldn't put it past it.
Did you know a lot of the shit that happened to him?

2200
02:16:38.140 --> 02:16:42.790
It was manipulated so that it would slow his role.
What,
what,
what kind of Shit?

2201
02:16:42.791 --> 02:16:46.810
Like what do you mean?
Well,
you know,
the people that he had around him,
I mean,

2202
02:16:46.811 --> 02:16:50.560
you know,
certainly of the king around a meet,
he took all his,
his,
his,

2203
02:16:50.590 --> 02:16:53.020
his people that he trusted away from them,

2204
02:16:53.470 --> 02:16:55.690
put different trainers in his corner,

2205
02:16:56.050 --> 02:17:00.160
different people that were influenced in him and did it just took him backwards.

2206
02:17:00.161 --> 02:17:04.360
Man in,
in all the people that actually helped got him there were fucking gone.

2207
02:17:05.020 --> 02:17:08.590
And those were the guys that was actually given him guidance as to,
you know,

2208
02:17:08.591 --> 02:17:11.500
how to conduct yourself,
be a man and all that stuff.

2209
02:17:11.950 --> 02:17:14.590
And he got around the vultures men and they in to me,

2210
02:17:14.591 --> 02:17:18.070
I think don king being don king,

2211
02:17:18.700 --> 02:17:19.810
he stood more money.

2212
02:17:19.811 --> 02:17:24.280
He stood a chance to make more money with someone taking out the fight,
you know,

2213
02:17:24.400 --> 02:17:27.340
11 to 12 rounds as opposed to one while he just,

2214
02:17:27.370 --> 02:17:31.180
he gave Mike the worst deals ever to yeah.
And the whole thing was terrible.

2215
02:17:31.181 --> 02:17:34.840
He stole money from him to this day.
Mike hates him.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's all terrible.

2216
02:17:35.390 --> 02:17:38.740
Anyway,
I'm make you my man.
Thank you.
I'll see you in a couple of days.
Yeah,

2217
02:17:38.780 --> 02:17:40.910
