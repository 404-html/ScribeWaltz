<v Speaker 3>certain bands.</v>

86
00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:50.160
<v Speaker 3>Just not supposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

87
00:03:50.161 --> 00:03:53.830
<v Speaker 3>like when I was a kid I used to have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>hide the fact that I loved kiss.</v>

88
00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because like when I was in like seventh</v>

89
00:03:56.891 --> 00:03:59.370
<v Speaker 3>grade kiss was not cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

90
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.630
<v Speaker 3>it was not a cool thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the young kids,</v>

91
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.610
<v Speaker 3>they won't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they all wanted to know about like ACDC</v>

92
00:04:04.611 --> 00:04:06.610
<v Speaker 3>and led Zeppelin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So where,</v>

93
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.150
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you were in seventh grade where was</v>

94
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.560
<v Speaker 3>kiss in their trajectory?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's what happened with kiss kiss had</v>

95
00:04:14.561 --> 00:04:18.940
<v Speaker 3>this gigantic loyal following who came</v>
<v Speaker 3>to all their concerts.</v>

96
00:04:18.941 --> 00:04:21.520
<v Speaker 3>They sold out gigantic arenas all over</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world,</v>

97
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.360
<v Speaker 3>but they couldn't get any radio play.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a real weird.</v>

98
00:04:25.361 --> 00:04:28.600
<v Speaker 3>They only have like a couple of big hits</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have like bath.</v>

99
00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.180
<v Speaker 3>Bath was a big hit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Detroit rock city,</v>

100
00:04:31.181 --> 00:04:34.390
<v Speaker 3>rock and roll all night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those were big in party every day.</v>

101
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.140
<v Speaker 3>That's still a big one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there wasn't a lot of radio play.</v>

102
00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.150
<v Speaker 3>It was hard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there was a lot of bands that had</v>

103
00:04:40.151 --> 00:04:42.520
<v Speaker 3>way more radio play,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for whatever reason,</v>

104
00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.210
<v Speaker 3>they never lost their popularity amongst</v>
<v Speaker 3>their hardcore fans because they put on</v>

105
00:04:46.211 --> 00:04:48.880
<v Speaker 3>a great show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to see them twice when they made</v>

106
00:04:48.881 --> 00:04:52.020
<v Speaker 3>their comeback tour with Kevin James.</v>

110
00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.590

<v Speaker 4>Combination that would be doing some</v>

111
00:05:03.441 --> 00:05:07.430
<v Speaker 4>standup up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever done stand up in front of</v>

133
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:02.240
<v Speaker 2>they telling me that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

134
00:06:02.241 --> 00:06:07.241
<v Speaker 2>it's getting ready to go out and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lights drop and the crowd goes crazy</v>

135
00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:12.230
<v Speaker 2>and I'm about to go home and that is not</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me at all.</v>

136
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.040
<v Speaker 2>And so then I just walk out and cold</v>
<v Speaker 2>like hello,</v>

137
00:06:16.041 --> 00:06:17.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm Hannah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And started trying to do comedy.</v>

138
00:06:17.871 --> 00:06:19.320
<v Speaker 2>And people just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where's</v>

139
00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.360
<v Speaker 2>unfreeze?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they just didn't know.</v>

140
00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.960
<v Speaker 2>We didn't know to just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

141
00:06:26.961 --> 00:06:29.510
<v Speaker 2>every crowd isn't ready for comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to settle,</v>

142
00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:34.540
<v Speaker 2>people have to be expecting it'll be</v>
<v Speaker 2>settled or it's a fight and I wasn't</v>

143
00:06:34.671 --> 00:06:38.000
<v Speaker 2>prepped to fight at that a moment just</v>
<v Speaker 2>to fight them down.</v>

144
00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:40.130
<v Speaker 2>I did all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's it.</v>

145
00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:45.240
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I'll do shows where I have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>rappers or band's opened for me also and</v>

146
00:06:45.471 --> 00:06:47.510
<v Speaker 2>sometimes the crowd at some people in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the crowd into it,</v>

147
00:06:47.511 --> 00:06:51.050
<v Speaker 2>some people aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's music that I enjoy so I try to</v>

148
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:54.500
<v Speaker 2>just mix it up sometimes and have a bit</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a variety show versus just straight</v>

149
00:06:54.501 --> 00:06:54.950
<v Speaker 2>stand up.</v>

150
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:56.780
<v Speaker 2>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what you want to do.</v>

151
00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.850
<v Speaker 2>You definitely do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

152
00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:00.620
<v Speaker 2>I've opened for a few bands back in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>

153
00:07:00.621 --> 00:07:03.050
<v Speaker 2>but I'll never do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of the experiences were just</v>

154
00:07:03.051 --> 00:07:04.090
<v Speaker 2>terrific.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>with like a bunch of musical</v>
<v Speaker 2>instruments,</v>

<v Speaker 2>There was like a little microphone set</v>
<v Speaker 2>up and then uh,</v>

161
00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.920

<v Speaker 2>I was supposed to bring girls towards</v>

162
00:07:24.921 --> 00:07:27.290
<v Speaker 2>the front of the stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to pick out attractive girls</v>

<v Speaker 2>they're the ones who are really close to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the camera,</v>

167
00:07:33.801 --> 00:07:37.400
<v Speaker 2>screaming Bon Jovi and then dirt bag for</v>

187
00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.580
<v Speaker 2>Chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What part of Chicago was like?</v>

188
00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:26.390
<v Speaker 2>Schaumburg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chicago,</v>

189
00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:30.800
<v Speaker 2>suburban.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what that Improv is 40 minutes</v>

190
00:08:30.801 --> 00:08:33.440
<v Speaker 2>outside of Chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a suburban kind of city,</v>

191
00:08:33.441 --> 00:08:35.300
<v Speaker 2>sort of thousand oaks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

192
00:08:35.301 --> 00:08:37.910
<v Speaker 2>That type of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I talked about that.</v>

193
00:08:37.911 --> 00:08:39.740
<v Speaker 2>I did that on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just,</v>

194
00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:44.770
<v Speaker 2>it was the venue was in the city and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I talked about that on stage,</v>

195
00:08:44.811 --> 00:08:48.800
<v Speaker 2>but most of that crowd was like white</v>
<v Speaker 2>kids from the suburbs and then it just</v>

196
00:08:48.801 --> 00:08:50.840
<v Speaker 2>turned from that and they were just</v>
<v Speaker 2>started.</v>

197
00:08:50.841 --> 00:08:53.390
<v Speaker 2>It just got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got restless and then some dude just</v>

198
00:08:53.391 --> 00:08:55.950
<v Speaker 2>yelled out for no reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like Kevin Hart.</v>

199
00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:57.420
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does that mean?</v>

200
00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:00.130
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's hilarious.</v>

201
00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:01.920
<v Speaker 2>Some psychology shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

202
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:06.120
<v Speaker 2>He's going to point to the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>successful comic ever compare.</v>

203
00:09:06.121 --> 00:09:09.720
<v Speaker 2>You mean Kevin Hart is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he's not the most successful,</v>

204
00:09:09.721 --> 00:09:11.250
<v Speaker 2>he's like top two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

205
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:12.070
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

206
00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:13.020
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are the arguments?</v>

207
00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:14.160
<v Speaker 2>There's three arguments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

208
00:09:14.161 --> 00:09:17.460
<v Speaker 2>It's like dice clay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dane Cook and Kevin Hart and as far as</v>

209
00:09:17.461 --> 00:09:18.870
<v Speaker 2>sustaining it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

210
00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:21.880
<v Speaker 2>he's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His run has been pretty crazy insane and</v>

211
00:09:21.881 --> 00:09:23.730
<v Speaker 2>he has his own shoe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I think it's him.</v>

212
00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:27.900
<v Speaker 2>He's kind of motivational shoe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>motivational quotes all over it and</v>

213
00:09:27.901 --> 00:09:28.261
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shoot.</v>

214
00:09:28.261 --> 00:09:31.980
<v Speaker 2>Actually Kevin Hart's shoot looks better</v>
<v Speaker 2>than a lot of athletes.</v>

215
00:09:31.981 --> 00:09:33.870
<v Speaker 2>Shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>

216
00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:37.200
<v Speaker 2>He's a smart dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's worked hard,</v>

217
00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:41.760
<v Speaker 2>but that's funny that he thinks that</v>
<v Speaker 2>like yelling that out.</v>

218
00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:44.190
<v Speaker 2>It's going to hurt your feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just more weird.</v>

219
00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:46.980
<v Speaker 2>It is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is weird,</v>

220
00:09:46.981 --> 00:09:48.660
<v Speaker 2>but that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>

221
00:09:48.661 --> 00:09:50.580
<v Speaker 2>that's a jab.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

222
00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:55.020
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting that people do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you point to like La as if almost</v>

223
00:09:55.021 --> 00:09:58.770
<v Speaker 2>as if someone's success,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though it's like astronomical,</v>

224
00:09:58.771 --> 00:10:03.090
<v Speaker 2>like crazy success even to a really</v>
<v Speaker 2>successful guy like you.</v>

225
00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:04.530
<v Speaker 2>It will fuck with you.</v>

00:12:07.411 --> 00:12:09.680
<v Speaker 5>we had a lot of good individual</v>
<v Speaker 5>competency assessment,</v>

268
00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:11.330

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:17.710
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was just,</v>

272
00:12:17.711 --> 00:12:21.810
<v Speaker 5>I felt the need to dig back because I</v>
<v Speaker 5>was just grabbing some fucking tacos and</v>

273
00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:24.070
<v Speaker 5>she just made me feel weird just by</v>
<v Speaker 5>being there.</v>

274
00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:27.020
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she felt like she could get a free shot</v>

275
00:12:27.021 --> 00:12:31.400
<v Speaker 4>at you because you're famous war or she</v>
<v Speaker 4>just does that to people all the time.</v>

276
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:33.670
<v Speaker 5>Maybe she does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe she just had a baby.</v>

277
00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:35.050
<v Speaker 5>I was intimidated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She was tall.</v>

278
00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:37.460
<v Speaker 5>Beautiful girl,</v>
<v Speaker 5>beautiful girl.</v>

279
00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:41.990
<v Speaker 5>We were like a voice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe a town like mine.</v>

280
00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:44.460
<v Speaker 5>Maybe I couldn't handle my own tone is</v>
<v Speaker 5>actually.</v>

281
00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:49.160
<v Speaker 5>Sounds like you not like me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but she had kind of not depth but just</v>

282
00:12:49.161 --> 00:12:49.994
<v Speaker 5>suck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

283
00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:52.620
<v Speaker 4>Tone that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

284
00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:56.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe she was being rude.</v>

285
00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:58.550
<v Speaker 4>She may have been just a big rude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>giant bitch at once.</v>

286
00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.060
<v Speaker 4>Like dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to take that challenge.</v>

287
00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:03.700
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you're a girl that's that big</v>

288
00:13:03.701 --> 00:13:05.650
<v Speaker 4>and athletic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he could probably fuck up a lot of</v>

289
00:13:05.651 --> 00:13:06.484
<v Speaker 4>dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

290
00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:08.360
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a big girl.</v>

291
00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:12.090
<v Speaker 4>She probably has to like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she probably has to test dudes all the</v>

292
00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:12.600
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

293
00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:16.430
<v Speaker 5>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe she was nagging me and I took it</v>

294
00:13:16.431 --> 00:13:17.170
<v Speaker 5>the wrong way.</v>

295
00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:19.060
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe if you just took it like an ace,</v>

296
00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:21.550
<v Speaker 4>you just rolled with it.</v>

297
00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:23.740
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

298
00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:25.720
<v Speaker 4>but the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that.</v>

299
00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:27.160

<v Speaker 5>but like moving her body positively,</v>

356
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:55.820
<v Speaker 5>but not saying a word but not saying a</v>
<v Speaker 5>word to the point where I'm like,</v>

357
00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:57.690
<v Speaker 5>I gotta check and see if this is okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I popped my head up.</v>

00:15:57.691 --> 00:15:58.521
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

363
00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:11.270
<v Speaker 2>I had to check.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

365
00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:13.610
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're good.</v>

366
00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:18.610
<v Speaker 2>I was back at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she didn't make a noise.</v>

367
00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:22.640
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how weird pussies and sounds with no</v>

368
00:16:22.641 --> 00:16:24.710
<v Speaker 2>moaning or yeps uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes</v>

369
00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:27.081
<v Speaker 2>it would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>

370
00:16:27.081 --> 00:16:27.860
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

371
00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:29.360
<v Speaker 2>it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was weird.</v>

372
00:16:29.361 --> 00:16:31.860
<v Speaker 2>But I could tell she I've been thinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about nothing else for</v>

373
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.570
<v Speaker 2>no moaning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just acapella pussy eating.</v>

374
00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:42.440
<v Speaker 2>But I could feel her body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like she's moving the body around.</v>

375
00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.890
<v Speaker 2>I could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could tell she came a couple times</v>

376
00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:49.310
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] like air came out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's how it works.</v>

377
00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:51.110
<v Speaker 2>I think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

378
00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:54.470
<v Speaker 2>because at one point yet I feel some air</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming out.</v>

379
00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:56.090
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it didn't make a noise.</v>

380
00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:59.090
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we're ever going to really</v>

381
00:16:59.091 --> 00:17:00.440
<v Speaker 2>know if they're coming or not.</v>

382
00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:03.140
<v Speaker 2>I think it can be a lot of fuckery going</v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

383
00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:05.730
<v Speaker 2>A lot of fake orgasms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't know.</v>

384
00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:10.070
<v Speaker 2>A lot of times girls just fake come so</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you could stop real.</v>

385
00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:13.640
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm guessing it must've happened,</v>

386
00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:17.270
<v Speaker 2>but I'm just saying I don't think error</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming out constitutes orgasm.</v>

387
00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:22.250
<v Speaker 2>Seems like it should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well there should be like a little</v>

388
00:17:22.251 --> 00:17:23.930
<v Speaker 2>Turkey tests or the baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She loves me.</v>

389
00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:26.250
<v Speaker 2>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We ended up hooking up,</v>

390
00:17:26.251 --> 00:17:29.780
<v Speaker 2>but I go out to lunch and then I</v>
<v Speaker 2>realized we just no,</v>

391
00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:31.820

<v Speaker 2>no compatibility.</v>

392
00:17:31.821 --> 00:17:35.720
<v Speaker 2>All this chicken does it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even like when you eat her pussy.</v>

393
00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:38.840
<v Speaker 2>So I need to know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>need to know.</v>

394
00:17:38.841 --> 00:17:41.960
<v Speaker 2>It's just lazier.</v>

395
00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:45.130

<v Speaker 5>does.</v>

<v Speaker 4>weird to build up to doing it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>maybe 10 years now.</v>

476
00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:24.150

<v Speaker 1>in with funding and stuff,</v>

477
00:21:24.221 --> 00:21:27.970
<v Speaker 1>but I looked at this one place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just one building in Chicago,</v>

478
00:21:27.971 --> 00:21:31.000

<v Speaker 1>it's a lot of money and they will have</v>

479
00:21:31.001 --> 00:21:32.800
<v Speaker 1>to be an all cash buyer and I can't do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

497
00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:20.440
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something cool about just the</v>

498
00:22:20.441 --> 00:22:23.800
<v Speaker 1>standard ness of it all the wood panels</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the door and you know,</v>

499
00:22:23.801 --> 00:22:24.634

<v Speaker 1>I want to do entertainment for fun like</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven years from now and that foot</v>

<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

530
00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:50.990
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas that was not necessary to go on</v>

531
00:23:50.991 --> 00:23:55.020
<v Speaker 1>the road or do a TV show or do a movie</v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's like,</v>

532
00:23:55.170 --> 00:24:00.080
<v Speaker 1>I would really love to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then I'm torn because I want your</v>

00:24:00.081 --> 00:24:02.600
<v Speaker 1>hotel to be successful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I want you to keep doing comedy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't want you to turn into a lazy</v>
<v Speaker 1>pitch.</v>

535
00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:08.420
<v Speaker 1>Not a lazy bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would be doing stuff with my real</v>

536
00:24:08.421 --> 00:24:10.910
<v Speaker 1>estate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanna I wanna get my goal.</v>

537
00:24:10.911 --> 00:24:12.710
<v Speaker 1>I want to get another building this year</v>
<v Speaker 1>and him.</v>

538
00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:17.740
<v Speaker 1>You're a magnet and do to get to</v>
<v Speaker 1>multifamily properties a year for the</v>

539
00:24:17.901 --> 00:24:21.690
<v Speaker 1>next five years and then ran for</v>
<v Speaker 1>president and then.</v>

540
00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:22.613
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

541
00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:28.610
<v Speaker 1>because that only pays 400,000 a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the speaking fees.</v>

542
00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:30.360
<v Speaker 1>Speaking feats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whew.</v>

543
00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:33.290
<v Speaker 1>That's when you make all your money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do do your eight years.</v>

544
00:24:33.291 --> 00:24:36.970
<v Speaker 1>Then when you get out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make a billion dollars on bomb is</v>

545
00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:38.340
<v Speaker 1>gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make a.</v>

546
00:24:38.530 --> 00:24:42.650
<v Speaker 1>let me tell you a couple of millions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know who should be rooting and</v>

547
00:24:42.651 --> 00:24:46.730
<v Speaker 1>crossing his fingers that trump wins as</v>
<v Speaker 1>obama because if,</v>

548
00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:50.300
<v Speaker 1>if trump wins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obama will make so much fucking money.</v>

549
00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:51.910
<v Speaker 1>Talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

550
00:24:51.911 --> 00:24:55.550
<v Speaker 1>like democracy and giving speeches about</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it's like to be a president and</v>

551
00:24:55.551 --> 00:24:57.380
<v Speaker 1>what it's like to run the greatest</v>
<v Speaker 1>nation in the world.</v>

552
00:24:57.380 --> 00:24:58.790
<v Speaker 1>Fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Either way,</v>

553
00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:00.560
<v Speaker 1>trump always going to be fine either</v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

554
00:25:00.561 --> 00:25:02.810
<v Speaker 1>but he couldn't like it literally</v>
<v Speaker 1>doubled his money.</v>

555
00:25:02.811 --> 00:25:05.450
<v Speaker 1>If trump ones deep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's a theory.</v>

556
00:25:05.451 --> 00:25:06.740
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people have said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

557
00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:10.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he wants to win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think he wants to win with the</v>

558
00:25:10.251 --> 00:25:12.620
<v Speaker 1>moves he's been pulling?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man.</v>

559
00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:16.430
<v Speaker 1>They said he has one office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one campaign office in Florida that has</v>

560
00:25:16.431 --> 00:25:18.080
<v Speaker 1>four employees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had perfect</v>

561
00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:24.410
<v Speaker 1>like Hashtag tiger blood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not.</v>

562
00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:28.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond the idiotic shit he said he's not</v>

563
00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:33.250
<v Speaker 1>really running an efficient campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's entirely possible that he doesn't</v>

564
00:25:33.561 --> 00:25:36.350
<v Speaker 1>really want to win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you think about it,</v>

565
00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:39.560
<v Speaker 1>it's entirely possible that he thought</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it would be like,</v>

566
00:25:39.561 --> 00:25:42.740
<v Speaker 1>remember when Howard stern ran for</v>
<v Speaker 1>governor of New York because that</v>

567
00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:44.000
<v Speaker 1>nineties?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

568
00:25:44.001 --> 00:25:46.330
<v Speaker 1>Something like that wasn't Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

569
00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:48.260
<v Speaker 1>I think it was somewhere in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

570
00:25:48.261 --> 00:25:50.360
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think Howard stern really wanted</v>

571
00:25:50.361 --> 00:25:51.194
<v Speaker 1>to be the governor.</v>

572
00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:52.370
<v Speaker 1>Governor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>governor.</v>

573
00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:54.350
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think he wanted to have some fun.</v>

574
00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:57.050
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that might've been what happened</v>

575
00:25:57.051 --> 00:26:00.080
<v Speaker 1>with Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he might've been just thinking he</v>

576
00:26:00.081 --> 00:26:05.030
<v Speaker 1>was going to make a splash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have some fun and a nice into deep.</v>

577
00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:07.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was still doing his TV show back</v>

578
00:26:07.191 --> 00:26:08.090
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>

579
00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:10.940
<v Speaker 1>like he was still the celebrity</v>
<v Speaker 1>apprentice guy or whatever.</v>

580
00:26:10.941 --> 00:26:13.850
<v Speaker 1>It is not a celebrity apprentice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that the name of the show?</v>

581
00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:16.700
<v Speaker 1>Why is it sounds so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just the apprentice.</v>

582
00:26:16.701 --> 00:26:21.701
<v Speaker 1>Then it was the apprentice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So NBC fired him from that show.</v>

583
00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:23.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you were saying a bunch of shit</v>

584
00:26:23.961 --> 00:26:25.910
<v Speaker 1>about Mexicans and when they fired him</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the show,</v>

585
00:26:25.911 --> 00:26:28.610
<v Speaker 1>that's when he ramped it up and when he</v>
<v Speaker 1>ramped it up,</v>

586
00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:31.490
<v Speaker 1>that's when he got more and more popular</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's when he won the Republican</v>

587
00:26:31.491 --> 00:26:34.100
<v Speaker 1>nomination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's all part of it is because NBC</v>

588
00:26:34.101 --> 00:26:39.101
<v Speaker 1>canceled his fucking show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what happened and this is where</v>

589
00:26:39.321 --> 00:26:41.660
<v Speaker 1>we got to blame.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got NBC and we got Caitlyn Jenner</v>

590
00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:44.190
<v Speaker 1>because there's a part of America</v>

591
00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:47.550
<v Speaker 3>that when Caitlyn Jenner one the woman</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the year have to being a woman for</v>

592
00:26:47.551 --> 00:26:51.390
<v Speaker 3>six months and when espn did that giant</v>
<v Speaker 3>piece on her and you know,</v>

593
00:26:51.391 --> 00:26:55.260
<v Speaker 3>they're fucking flying over our house</v>
<v Speaker 3>with a helicopter and the drapes are</v>

594
00:26:55.261 --> 00:26:57.780
<v Speaker 3>blowing in the breeze and she's hiding</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the shadows and you're like,</v>

595
00:26:57.781 --> 00:27:00.720
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a part of America that was like,</v>

596
00:27:00.721 --> 00:27:05.250
<v Speaker 3>fuck this know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got To put our foot down.</v>

597
00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:10.200
<v Speaker 3>We got to put our fucking foot down now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then trump came along.</v>

598
00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:11.850
<v Speaker 3>I'm an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they were like,</v>

599
00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:16.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm an asshole to stand up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stand proud people got upset.</v>

600
00:27:16.850 --> 00:27:19.380
<v Speaker 3>I think there's like an ebb and flow to</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

601
00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:23.190
<v Speaker 3>I think when things go too left wing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>too progressive to transgenders in the</v>

602
00:27:23.191 --> 00:27:25.170
<v Speaker 3>bathroom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that crazy shit when that.</v>

603
00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:28.170
<v Speaker 3>When that goes down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a part of America just not ready</v>

604
00:27:28.171 --> 00:27:32.440
<v Speaker 3>yet and they go foot and that's where</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get trump has ssi.</v>

605
00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:34.260
<v Speaker 3>That solitary solid right</v>

606
00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:35.820
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a little fascinated.</v>

607
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:41.000
<v Speaker 2>When I watched the people in the crowd</v>
<v Speaker 2>just really agreeing,</v>

608
00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:45.730
<v Speaker 2>lift the bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said when he said the stuff,</v>

<v Speaker 2>black people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you got to lose?</v>

<v Speaker 2>in the back like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>He said a speech.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's a speech.</v>

<v Speaker 2>There's no jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You live in poverty.</v>

616
00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:06.540
<v Speaker 2>The schools are bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's 58 percent unemployment with the</v>

617
00:28:06.541 --> 00:28:07.800
<v Speaker 2>youth.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's not bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know exactly who you're doing.</v>

620
00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:16.610
<v Speaker 3>While we were watching earlier when he</v>
<v Speaker 3>said that Obama founded isis.</v>

621
00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:20.570

622
00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:25.070
<v Speaker 3>Like he's saying some crazy shit for it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's saying some plates.</v>

623
00:28:25.071 --> 00:28:25.940
<v Speaker 3>We could hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie</v>

<v Speaker 6>scene.</v>

625
00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:35.100
<v Speaker 6>African-Americans suffered under</v>
<v Speaker 6>democratic control.</v>

626
00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:39.750
<v Speaker 6>To those I say the following.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God,</v>

<v Speaker 7>he's making a documentary</v>
<v Speaker 7>shadow from the head cover.</v>

00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:15.590
<v Speaker 6>Your schools are no good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You have no jobs.</v>

636
00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:19.730
<v Speaker 6>Fifty eight percent of your youth is</v>
<v Speaker 6>unemployed.</v>

637
00:29:21.410 --> 00:29:24.110
<v Speaker 6>What the hell do you have to lose?</v>

638
00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:28.670
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's amazing to watch the movies.</v>

639
00:29:28.671 --> 00:29:29.780
<v Speaker 7>A coen brothers movie.</v>

640
00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:35.770
<v Speaker 6>Let the end of four years.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guarantee you that I will get over 95</v>

641
00:29:37.281 --> 00:29:41.470
<v Speaker 6>percent of the African American vote.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I you.</v>

642
00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:46.210
<v Speaker 3>I promise you why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But even just saying that,</v>

643
00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:47.170
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

644
00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:48.970
<v Speaker 3>Who gives a shit?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're what?</v>

645
00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:50.590
<v Speaker 3>What percentage?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you know that?</v>

646
00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:52.710
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't have a plan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just talk.</v>

647
00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:54.510
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fat,</v>

648
00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:56.280
<v Speaker 3>but the crowd is wet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

649
00:29:56.660 --> 00:30:00.030
<v Speaker 5>If he was doing that for 30 people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

650
00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:01.390
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get it,</v>

651
00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:02.150
<v Speaker 5>but</v>

652
00:30:02.150 --> 00:30:06.440
<v Speaker 3>I have some pretty significant theories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that people are way too soft.</v>

653
00:30:06.530 --> 00:30:10.520
<v Speaker 3>I think it's way too easy to stay alive</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think we've never ever had that in</v>

654
00:30:10.521 --> 00:30:15.200
<v Speaker 3>human history and I think that we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>over because of it at a ridiculous rate</v>

655
00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:18.770
<v Speaker 3>and I think there's a bunch of people</v>
<v Speaker 3>out there that have no business fucking</v>

656
00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:20.780
<v Speaker 3>and slash or having kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

657
00:30:20.781 --> 00:30:22.940
<v Speaker 3>you just turned very serious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm fucking serious.</v>

658
00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:27.170
<v Speaker 3>And it's not their fault.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's no one's fault.</v>

659
00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:30.410
<v Speaker 3>It's no one's fault.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just the cycle that we're in.</v>

660
00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:34.340
<v Speaker 3>We're in a cycle of safety.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're in a cycle of safety.</v>

661
00:30:34.550 --> 00:30:36.800
<v Speaker 3>That's what we're in a cycle of</v>
<v Speaker 3>recreational outrage.</v>

662
00:30:36.801 --> 00:30:38.990
<v Speaker 3>People are getting outrage at things</v>
<v Speaker 3>that don't make any sense.</v>

663
00:30:38.991 --> 00:30:42.440
<v Speaker 3>The reason why there's no life</v>
<v Speaker 3>threatening situations that are</v>

664
00:30:42.441 --> 00:30:44.810
<v Speaker 3>constantly at your door.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no wolves,</v>

665
00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:47.030
<v Speaker 3>there's no fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing's going wrong.</v>

666
00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:49.100
<v Speaker 3>So we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going after words.</v>

667
00:30:49.101 --> 00:30:50.930
<v Speaker 3>You can't say retarded anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

668
00:30:50.931 --> 00:30:52.370
<v Speaker 3>don't say tranny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't,</v>

669
00:30:53.030 --> 00:30:57.290
<v Speaker 3>we're getting outraged about shit that</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't make any sense.</v>

670
00:30:57.980 --> 00:31:02.360
<v Speaker 5>Product of the Internet is that didn't</v>
<v Speaker 5>survive the war.</v>

671
00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:04.990
<v Speaker 3>Bad example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Having wolves to come at you.</v>

672
00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:07.750
<v Speaker 3>You're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's just a product of the</v>

673
00:31:07.751 --> 00:31:09.730
<v Speaker 3>Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People being able to react to something</v>

674
00:31:09.731 --> 00:31:12.010
<v Speaker 3>and being able to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

675
00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:16.210
<v Speaker 3>gather together on something and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>start a petition.</v>

676
00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:18.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are bad examples I have who's</v>

677
00:31:18.490 --> 00:31:20.950
<v Speaker 3>retarded is not a bad example because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

678
00:31:20.951 --> 00:31:22.870
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't mean a disease.</v>

679
00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:25.540
<v Speaker 3>It just means someone who's slow to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

680
00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:29.530
<v Speaker 3>We should not a medically imply that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're picking on someone with a mental</v>

681
00:31:29.531 --> 00:31:30.730
<v Speaker 3>illness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in fact,</v>

682
00:31:30.731 --> 00:31:34.360
<v Speaker 3>when people initially had down syndrome,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the birth certificates would come,</v>

683
00:31:34.361 --> 00:31:38.710
<v Speaker 3>it would call them a mongoloid idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be like what it would be</v>

684
00:31:38.711 --> 00:31:43.630
<v Speaker 3>listed on the actual birth certificate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mongoloid Mongolo idiot.</v>

685
00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:46.030
<v Speaker 3>Very straightforward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very straightforward and very</v>

686
00:31:46.031 --> 00:31:46.864
<v Speaker 3>bizarre,</v>
<v Speaker 3>harsh,</v>

687
00:31:46.990 --> 00:31:49.010
<v Speaker 3>hard times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are hard times,</v>

688
00:31:49.011 --> 00:31:50.670
<v Speaker 3>but we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's good.</v>

689
00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:51.940
<v Speaker 3>It looks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything is good.</v>

690
00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:54.730
<v Speaker 3>It's better to be alive right now is as</v>
<v Speaker 3>good as it gets.</v>

691
00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:58.060
<v Speaker 3>This is a beautiful time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we're going to get things like that.</v>

692
00:31:58.090 --> 00:32:00.880
<v Speaker 3>We're going to get things like that</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump thing because it's so fucking easy</v>

693
00:32:00.881 --> 00:32:02.350
<v Speaker 3>to stay alive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be alive.</v>

694
00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:05.590
<v Speaker 3>But it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fun for it to be easy to be alive.</v>

695
00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:07.400
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was at my friend's house.</v>

696
00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:08.290
<v Speaker 3>Just kind of bounced back.</v>

697

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was playing ps four and uh,</v>

698
00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:18.250
<v Speaker 5>he was playing baseball on a ps four,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which I think is horrible.</v>

699
00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:22.190
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Baseball video games.</v>

703
00:32:26.981 --> 00:32:28.700

<v Speaker 5>But baseball,</v>

704
00:32:28.910 --> 00:32:30.710
<v Speaker 5>it's not good on a video game that to</v>
<v Speaker 5>me,</v>

705
00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:32.620
<v Speaker 5>obviously it's everybody likes what they</v>
<v Speaker 5>likes,</v>

706
00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:37.220
<v Speaker 5>but I'm over there as a guest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't even have a second</v>

707
00:32:37.221 --> 00:32:40.220
<v Speaker 5>controller.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I just wanted to play something</v>

713
00:32:56.061 --> 00:32:57.290
<v Speaker 5>different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They can do that.</v>

714
00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:02.320
<v Speaker 5>They came through with with the UFC game</v>
<v Speaker 5>under control and we hooked that shit up</v>

<v Speaker 5>UFC.</v>

716
00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.870
<v Speaker 5>How the hell did they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's because they.</v>

717
00:33:06.871 --> 00:33:09.770
<v Speaker 5>It's just basically a delivery.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You just use the posts.</v>

718
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:13.250
<v Speaker 5>It's not target.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's postmates where as a person and</v>

719
00:33:13.251 --> 00:33:15.380
<v Speaker 5>they are driving around in eight waiting</v>
<v Speaker 5>for orders.</v>

720
00:33:15.670 --> 00:33:16.580
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

723
00:33:21.611 --> 00:33:22.051
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>

724
00:33:22.051 --> 00:33:22.760
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>

00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:25.130
<v Speaker 3>Thinks is the best time to be alive ever</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure,</v>

726
00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:30.100
<v Speaker 3>but there's guys like you and this guy's</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a lot of my other friends and that</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm just happy to know and happy to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>around and then there's a bunch of</v>

728
00:33:33.591 --> 00:33:37.340
<v Speaker 3>people out there unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and for them they've been exposed to</v>

729
00:33:37.341 --> 00:33:41.300
<v Speaker 3>some bad ideas and they don't have the</v>
<v Speaker 3>best genetics and they're living in</v>

730
00:33:41.301 --> 00:33:44.060
<v Speaker 3>somewhere that sucks and they get to</v>
<v Speaker 3>vote too.</v>

731
00:33:44.410 --> 00:33:46.990
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do see when I do,</v>

732
00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:48.513
<v Speaker 5>I'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

733
00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:51.700
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love reading comments on articles just</v>

734
00:33:51.701 --> 00:33:56.701
<v Speaker 5>to just to see is that real?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that a real human being that thinks</v>

735
00:33:57.281 --> 00:34:02.281
<v Speaker 5>that that's the date in fascinated all</v>
<v Speaker 5>the time where it hurts me and it makes</v>

736
00:34:02.291 --> 00:34:03.530
<v Speaker 5>me happy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>At the same time,</v>

737
00:34:03.610 --> 00:34:06.640
<v Speaker 5>I can't believe that I live on the same</v>
<v Speaker 5>earth.</v>

738
00:34:06.641 --> 00:34:10.840
<v Speaker 5>Is that type of person that that thinks</v>
<v Speaker 5>that for real or a person that really</v>

739
00:34:10.841 --> 00:34:15.220
<v Speaker 5>thinks that trump will be president.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A person that has these will trump could</v>

740
00:34:15.221 --> 00:34:15.950
<v Speaker 5>use about that.</v>

741
00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:17.560
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's halfway there.</v>

742
00:34:17.650 --> 00:34:19.000
<v Speaker 3>He's the Republican nominee.</v>

743
00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:20.490
<v Speaker 5>He is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's got a super far.</v>

744
00:34:20.491 --> 00:34:22.920
<v Speaker 5>I don't think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it's going to happen from</v>

745
00:34:22.921 --> 00:34:25.080
<v Speaker 5>here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The fact that he's gotten his closest</v>

746
00:34:25.081 --> 00:34:26.100
<v Speaker 5>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy,</v>

747
00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:28.940
<v Speaker 3>but I think those people that you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about that you can't believe,</v>

748
00:34:28.941 --> 00:34:32.270
<v Speaker 3>they think that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're a product of whatever the fuck</v>

749
00:34:32.271 --> 00:34:35.870
<v Speaker 3>happened to them in their world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's pockets of the world that</v>

750
00:34:35.871 --> 00:34:39.720
<v Speaker 3>are all a mess right now and if you were</v>
<v Speaker 3>born in that pocket or I was born in</v>

751
00:34:39.730 --> 00:34:41.660
<v Speaker 3>that pocket and the same sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>circumstances.</v>

752
00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:43.250
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the things that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard.</v>

753
00:34:43.251 --> 00:34:46.520
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to recognize as a person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see someone's an asshole.</v>

754
00:34:46.521 --> 00:34:47.780
<v Speaker 3>He just goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking asshole,</v>

755
00:34:47.781 --> 00:34:51.260
<v Speaker 3>fuck them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in a way we kind of kind of look at</v>

756
00:34:51.261 --> 00:34:52.550
<v Speaker 3>those people go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>damn,</v>

757
00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:56.450
<v Speaker 3>they just got fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They got born into a group of dummies</v>

758
00:34:56.780 --> 00:35:01.220
<v Speaker 3>with a bunch of violent tendencies and</v>
<v Speaker 3>crime and bullshit and nonsense and this</v>

759
00:35:01.221 --> 00:35:04.410
<v Speaker 3>is all they've ever known and they just</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to get by and you know,</v>

760
00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:05.500
<v Speaker 3>a guy like trump comes in</v>

761
00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:06.343
<v Speaker 8>how long ago</v>

762
00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:14.510
<v Speaker 3>and if it wasn't trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could be a number of motivational</v>

763
00:35:14.511 --> 00:35:18.830
<v Speaker 3>speakers all throughout the country that</v>
<v Speaker 3>might have nefarious intentions.</v>

764
00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:20.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anybody who's really like super</v>

765
00:35:20.961 --> 00:35:25.580
<v Speaker 3>charismatic now it's kind of open game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when a guy like trump can come</v>

766
00:35:25.581 --> 00:35:29.790
<v Speaker 3>along and talk as much crazy shit as he</v>
<v Speaker 3>has and in,</v>

767
00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:34.370
<v Speaker 3>in some ways I'm not opposed to him</v>
<v Speaker 3>women because in some ways I'm like,</v>

768
00:35:34.371 --> 00:35:37.350
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has the best guy to fuck this system</v>

769
00:35:37.351 --> 00:35:40.470
<v Speaker 3>in the ass and we know this system</v>
<v Speaker 3>sucks.</v>

770
00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:42.900
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like this guy's a suicide</v>
<v Speaker 3>bomber.</v>

771
00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:48.170
<v Speaker 3>Like trump's like this wild dude with a</v>
<v Speaker 3>vest and a sweaty face and he just run</v>

772
00:35:48.261 --> 00:35:49.260
<v Speaker 3>it into that cafe.</v>

773
00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:53.180
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

774
00:35:53.181 --> 00:35:56.190
<v Speaker 3>he had a two party system is flawed</v>
<v Speaker 3>anyways.</v>

775
00:35:56.940 --> 00:36:01.940
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to put that on a meme.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could be more than two vbl able to</v>

776
00:36:02.731 --> 00:36:05.040
<v Speaker 3>run short.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It should be.</v>

777
00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:07.410
<v Speaker 3>She'd be a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know Tom Rhodes?</v>

778
00:36:08.010 --> 00:36:09.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was on Duncan trussell's podcast the</v>

779
00:36:09.991 --> 00:36:14.130
<v Speaker 3>other day and he was talking about um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way it's set up in Holland.</v>

780
00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:15.840
<v Speaker 3>Taylor seven?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

781
00:36:15.870 --> 00:36:18.000
<v Speaker 3>Something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie see if he could find out how many</v>

782
00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:21.210
<v Speaker 3>candidates they have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many parties rather than they have</v>

783
00:36:21.211 --> 00:36:22.320
<v Speaker 3>in Holland,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's many,</v>

784
00:36:22.321 --> 00:36:23.154
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>

785
00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:26.550
<v Speaker 3>and they're all like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're real reasonable like how they're</v>

786
00:36:26.551 --> 00:36:30.510
<v Speaker 3>placed and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure there's like a lot of us,</v>

787
00:36:30.511 --> 00:36:34.620
<v Speaker 3>me included that we were upset because</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some things on one side of that</v>

788
00:36:34.621 --> 00:36:37.980
<v Speaker 3>I agree with some things on another side</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree with and some things that aren't</v>

789
00:36:37.981 --> 00:36:39.240
<v Speaker 3>being represented at all.</v>

790
00:36:39.490 --> 00:36:42.240
<v Speaker 3>Like the idea that these two people and</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever opinions they discussed,</v>

791
00:36:42.250 --> 00:36:44.610
<v Speaker 3>the only opinions that we should all be</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about.</v>

792
00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:46.650
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

793
00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:51.100
<v Speaker 3>Should be more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why can't they collaborate on that?</v>

794
00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:53.430
<v Speaker 3>Trump is looking how many they have in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holland.</v>

795
00:36:53.431 --> 00:36:57.590
<v Speaker 3>This is crazy how many.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have jamie 11,</v>

796
00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:00.120
<v Speaker 3>but there's 17,</v>
<v Speaker 3>six,</v>

797
00:37:00.121 --> 00:37:01.950
<v Speaker 3>seven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't vote in the 2012 elections,</v>

798
00:37:01.951 --> 00:37:04.650
<v Speaker 3>so that might be brand new.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure if they have 11 different</v>

799
00:37:04.651 --> 00:37:07.410
<v Speaker 3>parties voted in the last year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They all had candidates.</v>

800
00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:09.400
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See that's.</v>

801
00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:11.430
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how it should be done.</v>

802
00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:16.350
<v Speaker 3>We were getting hoodwinked by a group of</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that are just controlling this</v>

803
00:37:16.351 --> 00:37:20.550
<v Speaker 3>ancient system and it's not a good</v>
<v Speaker 3>system and they know it's not a good</v>

804
00:37:20.551 --> 00:37:22.950
<v Speaker 3>system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the only way you could ever stop</v>

805
00:37:22.951 --> 00:37:26.550
<v Speaker 3>this system is you have to have people</v>
<v Speaker 3>with pure hearts and minds that are</v>

806
00:37:26.551 --> 00:37:29.910
<v Speaker 3>willing to admit the system sucks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they're going to lose whatever</v>

807
00:37:29.911 --> 00:37:34.140
<v Speaker 3>position of influence that they have and</v>
<v Speaker 3>step back and be judged by the merit of</v>

808
00:37:34.141 --> 00:37:35.160
<v Speaker 3>their own ideas.</v>

809
00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:37.050
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of being a senator or</v>

810
00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:39.330
<v Speaker 3>congressman or a president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just say,</v>

811
00:37:39.331 --> 00:37:40.860
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this system sucks.</v>

812
00:37:41.250 --> 00:37:42.570
<v Speaker 3>It sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it sucks.</v>

813
00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:47.250
<v Speaker 3>Let's get to get the best legal scholars</v>
<v Speaker 3>and and people that understand human</v>

814
00:37:47.251 --> 00:37:52.251
<v Speaker 3>nature and let's can conduct and compose</v>
<v Speaker 3>a system that works and let's really run</v>

815
00:37:53.101 --> 00:37:56.040
<v Speaker 3>the government like it's one of us and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we're all in this together.</v>

816
00:37:56.670 --> 00:37:58.410
<v Speaker 3>These old folks don't realize that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

817
00:37:58.411 --> 00:38:01.320
<v Speaker 3>they just cling to power until they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the grave.</v>

818
00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:03.610
<v Speaker 3>They just hang onto it like it's her</v>
<v Speaker 3>route.</v>

819
00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:05.910
<v Speaker 3>Pancan over the abyss.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They know what they're going to drop</v>

820
00:38:05.911 --> 00:38:07.500
<v Speaker 3>into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to let go,</v>

821
00:38:07.790 --> 00:38:09.230
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

822
00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:14.100
<v Speaker 3>you need to control these independence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Reduced the number of percentages they</v>

823
00:38:14.101 --> 00:38:16.410
<v Speaker 3>have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just the way it's going to be,</v>

824
00:38:16.411 --> 00:38:18.550
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm fascinated by that.</v>

825
00:38:18.590 --> 00:38:23.590
<v Speaker 3>Just the level of obviously we have egos</v>
<v Speaker 3>to what to do what we do,</v>

826
00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:28.710
<v Speaker 3>but to one of run a country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just the level,</v>

827
00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:30.090
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you can't take jokes,</v>

828
00:38:30.091 --> 00:38:32.610
<v Speaker 3>he can't play basketball and you're not</v>
<v Speaker 3>really good at fighting.</v>

829
00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.830
<v Speaker 3>You find a way to be special.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Parts of this are different.</v>

830
00:38:38.330 --> 00:38:42.160
<v Speaker 3>It's a weird impulse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>different type of of pressure.</v>

831
00:38:42.730 --> 00:38:44.530
<v Speaker 3>Here's the weirdest thing about that</v>
<v Speaker 3>impulse.</v>

832
00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:48.010
<v Speaker 3>When you see someone out there in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>

833
00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:52.600
<v Speaker 3>when you see someone that you admire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's an athlete or a brilliant</v>

834
00:38:52.601 --> 00:38:56.090
<v Speaker 3>scholar or whoever the fuck it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see someone,</v>

835
00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:57.390
<v Speaker 3>a musician,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see some,</v>

836
00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:00.910
<v Speaker 3>you really admire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That person has accomplished something</v>

837
00:39:00.970 --> 00:39:02.150
<v Speaker 3>amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

838
00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:06.550
<v Speaker 3>All the president asked to do is get</v>
<v Speaker 3>people to like them,</v>

839
00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:07.810
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

840
00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:13.080
<v Speaker 3>Like Obama really didn't have a whole</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of experience in the world,</v>

841
00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:18.280
<v Speaker 3>like creating things or making things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It went from being a lawyer to a</v>

842
00:39:18.281 --> 00:39:18.990
<v Speaker 3>senator,</v>

843
00:39:18.990 --> 00:39:23.990
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Community activists and then state</v>

844
00:39:24.471 --> 00:39:26.360
<v Speaker 5>senator in the Senate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It mean.</v>

845
00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:27.690
<v Speaker 5>And he got it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think.</v>

846
00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:30.300
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if the state senate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he got it because uh,</v>

847
00:39:31.590 --> 00:39:35.340
<v Speaker 5>he moved up because the dude had a sex</v>
<v Speaker 5>scandal in Illinois.</v>

848
00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:36.470
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

849
00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:38.210
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what does that do?</v>

850
00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:41.120
<v Speaker 3>That's your state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget who it was,</v>

851
00:39:43.070 --> 00:39:45.000
<v Speaker 3>but he does not like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

852
00:39:45.070 --> 00:39:47.120
<v Speaker 3>like pick a person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>

853
00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:48.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>

854
00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:51.840
<v Speaker 3>some great person in history that's done</v>
<v Speaker 3>something amazing and you,</v>

855
00:39:51.841 --> 00:39:53.270
<v Speaker 3>you look at them and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

856
00:39:53.271 --> 00:39:58.010
<v Speaker 3>I would love it if that great person of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of wisdom and accomplishment if that</v>

857
00:39:58.011 --> 00:39:59.730
<v Speaker 3>person was step up and be president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

858
00:39:59.950 --> 00:40:02.960
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't necessarily have to be the</v>
<v Speaker 3>case in America.</v>

859
00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:04.980
<v Speaker 3>All you have to do is just be liked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

860
00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:07.220
<v Speaker 3>That's Kinda crazy.</v>

861
00:40:07.810 --> 00:40:09.400
<v Speaker 5>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is.</v>

862
00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:12.160
<v Speaker 5>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't even know.</v>

863
00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:17.190
<v Speaker 5>I mean both Hillary and trump.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Art Seventy or 65.</v>

864
00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:20.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're telling you why are you doing</v>

865
00:40:20.941 --> 00:40:21.540
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

866
00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:24.540
<v Speaker 3>Doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People can dream but don't dream so big.</v>

867
00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:26.040
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're 30 and you're thinking about</v>

868
00:40:26.041 --> 00:40:31.041
<v Speaker 3>retiring 33.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm already buying hotels and picking</v>

869
00:40:31.231 --> 00:40:31.810
<v Speaker 3>them up.</v>

870
00:40:31.810 --> 00:40:32.860
<v Speaker 5>Strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm thinking about.</v>

871
00:40:32.861 --> 00:40:35.170
<v Speaker 5>I'm a hundred percent because I like</v>
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>

872
00:40:35.171 --> 00:40:36.490
<v Speaker 5>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I enjoy this,</v>

873
00:40:36.491 --> 00:40:39.340
<v Speaker 5>but I mean I see.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I see how I could go.</v>

874
00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:44.970
<v Speaker 5>I just see how I look at how other</v>
<v Speaker 5>people have handled their moment and how</v>

875
00:40:45.881 --> 00:40:49.870
<v Speaker 5>other people handled their finances and</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to any part of that.</v>

876
00:40:49.871 --> 00:40:54.871
<v Speaker 5>So I'm making every step.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Every thing I do everyday is about,</v>

877
00:40:56.170 --> 00:41:00.940
<v Speaker 5>been super stable seven years from now</v>
<v Speaker 5>and comfortable and to have enough</v>

878
00:41:00.941 --> 00:41:01.720
<v Speaker 5>passive income.</v>

879
00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:03.520
<v Speaker 3>I don't have to worry about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's very smart,</v>

880
00:41:03.521 --> 00:41:04.600
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very smart.</v>

881
00:41:04.601 --> 00:41:06.790
<v Speaker 3>And you're doing it like in a real</v>
<v Speaker 3>proactive way.</v>

882
00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:08.860
<v Speaker 3>Not a whole lot of people look at it</v>
<v Speaker 3>that way.</v>

883
00:41:08.890 --> 00:41:10.780
<v Speaker 3>Everybody else just sort of like rides</v>
<v Speaker 3>it out,</v>

884
00:41:11.590 --> 00:41:14.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or it's a weird mindset,</v>

885
00:41:14.771 --> 00:41:16.480
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the investment mindset is so</v>

886
00:41:16.481 --> 00:41:18.220
<v Speaker 3>different than the creative mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

887
00:41:18.890 --> 00:41:21.050
<v Speaker 5>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just look,</v>

888
00:41:21.051 --> 00:41:23.090
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

889
00:41:23.091 --> 00:41:27.410
<v Speaker 5>not just spending smart and just</v>
<v Speaker 5>researched a lot now and just,</v>

890
00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:29.120
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>shifting my internet time from the</v>

891
00:41:29.121 --> 00:41:32.700
<v Speaker 5>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So just looking at properties and that's</v>

892
00:41:33.050 --> 00:41:34.670
<v Speaker 5>smart to do something else,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

893
00:41:34.671 --> 00:41:35.460
<v Speaker 5>And just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

894
00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:38.210
<v Speaker 5>I just don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to end up on those special.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I don't want to do anything.</v>

899
00:41:57.910 --> 00:41:59.180

00:43:00.301 --> 00:43:02.550
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh fuck the shit out of it.</v>

926
00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:07.000
<v Speaker 3>And they throw in some really hacky</v>
<v Speaker 3>producer who wound up getting he will.</v>

927
00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:10.980
<v Speaker 3>He wound up getting fired like halfway</v>
<v Speaker 3>through the six episodes that we did and</v>

928
00:43:10.981 --> 00:43:13.800
<v Speaker 3>it was allegedly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a bunch of other shit going on</v>

929
00:43:13.801 --> 00:43:16.960
<v Speaker 3>and the writing was off the charts bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>

930
00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:21.870
<v Speaker 3>So I got to be like on a bad show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a terrible feeling for season.</v>

931
00:43:22.330 --> 00:43:24.390
<v Speaker 3>Next six episodes six.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the first.</v>

932
00:43:24.450 --> 00:43:26.430
<v Speaker 3>The first one was the pilot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was really funny.</v>

933
00:43:26.431 --> 00:43:28.980
<v Speaker 3>And then it just was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of a sudden it was over here doing</v>

934
00:43:28.981 --> 00:43:33.270
<v Speaker 3>something that was terrible and you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>better off doing nothing than doing</v>

935
00:43:33.271 --> 00:43:34.440
<v Speaker 3>something you hate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

936
00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:37.410
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't make any sense because you</v>
<v Speaker 3>make money and ultimately it's worth</v>

937
00:43:37.411 --> 00:43:39.480
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And ultimately for me it was definitely</v>

938
00:43:39.481 --> 00:43:41.670
<v Speaker 3>worth something because I learned from</v>
<v Speaker 3>the experience.</v>

939
00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:45.060
<v Speaker 3>You can't just do a TV show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to be sure.</v>

940
00:43:45.150 --> 00:43:47.580
<v Speaker 3>And even if you're sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the pilot was really funny.</v>

941
00:43:47.581 --> 00:43:49.290
<v Speaker 3>I was pretty sure that that would be</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

942
00:43:50.310 --> 00:43:53.910
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter because a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 3>other factors can fall into place.</v>

943
00:43:53.911 --> 00:43:56.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just remembered I did do a bad show.</v>

944
00:43:56.371 --> 00:43:57.930
<v Speaker 3>Is My TV show last shit?</v>

945
00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:02.220
<v Speaker 3>What happened with that?</v>

946
00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:06.110
<v Speaker 5>It uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it mean we had our moments,</v>

947
00:44:06.111 --> 00:44:06.850
<v Speaker 5>but it just,</v>

948
00:44:06.850 --> 00:44:10.390
<v Speaker 3>it might need some more booze to get the</v>
<v Speaker 3>truth out of here with some ice.</v>

949
00:44:13.450 --> 00:44:15.440
<v Speaker 5>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it had his moments,</v>

950
00:44:15.441 --> 00:44:17.840
<v Speaker 5>but we didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>

951
00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:23.380
<v Speaker 5>they came with the idea that came to me</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the producing comedy central.</v>

952
00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:24.950
<v Speaker 5>It basically,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is the show,</v>

953
00:44:24.951 --> 00:44:27.710
<v Speaker 5>this idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Adam will do a sketches man on the</v>

954
00:44:27.711 --> 00:44:31.470
<v Speaker 5>street stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just just figuring out the quest answers</v>

955
00:44:31.471 --> 00:44:34.050
<v Speaker 5>to these questions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's just,</v>

956
00:44:34.530 --> 00:44:37.470
<v Speaker 5>I guess we didn't really focus it in</v>
<v Speaker 5>focus,</v>

957
00:44:37.471 --> 00:44:38.304
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

958
00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:43.140
<v Speaker 5>the point of view and it was kind of all</v>
<v Speaker 5>over the place and we had our funny</v>

959
00:44:43.141 --> 00:44:45.510
<v Speaker 5>moments and did some,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a couple of good sketches,</v>

960
00:44:45.511 --> 00:44:47.640
<v Speaker 5>but it just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by the end of it,</v>

961
00:44:47.641 --> 00:44:52.641
<v Speaker 5>it didn't feel I wasn't excited anymore</v>
<v Speaker 5>those last two episodes where just,</v>

962
00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:55.410
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and we do it in front of a live</v>

963
00:44:55.411 --> 00:44:57.990
<v Speaker 5>audience.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It really was just about finishing that</v>

964
00:44:57.991 --> 00:45:00.430
<v Speaker 5>shit man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that man.</v>

965
00:45:01.650 --> 00:45:04.710
<v Speaker 5>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm happy I did it and that I had that</v>

966
00:45:04.711 --> 00:45:05.580
<v Speaker 5>moment where,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

967
00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:08.730
<v Speaker 5>for what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what was that two months last year at my</v>

968
00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:10.860
<v Speaker 5>own TV show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not a lot of people get to say that.</v>

969
00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:13.050
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

970
00:45:13.051 --> 00:45:13.741
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

971
00:45:13.741 --> 00:45:14.700
<v Speaker 5>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

972
00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:17.010
<v Speaker 5>you learned a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I learned a lot.</v>

973
00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:19.830
<v Speaker 5>It was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Got To work with some cool people.</v>

974
00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:22.800
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it just wasn't as far as what I wanted</v>

975
00:45:22.801 --> 00:45:25.430
<v Speaker 5>my first,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

976
00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:28.880
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>kind of headline and project to be a.</v>

977
00:45:29.010 --> 00:45:31.710
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't that beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jamison</v>

978
00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:35.140
<v Speaker 3>and whiskey and nice just brought up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

979
00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:37.990
<v Speaker 3>now what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what were you trying to do and what went</v>

980
00:45:37.991 --> 00:45:40.420
<v Speaker 3>wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

981
00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:44.530
<v Speaker 3>what my interviewer now give me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>give me some ice.</v>

982
00:45:44.830 --> 00:45:49.830
<v Speaker 3>I sounded like Matt Lauer was like I do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just went into interview mode as I got</v>

983
00:45:49.961 --> 00:45:50.794
<v Speaker 3>some ice.</v>

984
00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:54.440
<v Speaker 5>I think I kind of went into it not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

985
00:45:55.070 --> 00:46:00.070
<v Speaker 5>not really knowing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I learned later on how to run</v>

986
00:46:01.341 --> 00:46:06.110
<v Speaker 5>things better and how to give people</v>
<v Speaker 5>direction on what I needed a little bit</v>

987
00:46:06.111 --> 00:46:08.000
<v Speaker 5>better,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't think we came in with a</v>

988
00:46:08.001 --> 00:46:13.001
<v Speaker 5>focus because I was thinking with a TV</v>
<v Speaker 5>show that not that we would completely</v>

989
00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:17.420
<v Speaker 5>winging it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that we would,</v>

990
00:46:17.421 --> 00:46:20.990
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>be able to kind of find it as we go.</v>

991
00:46:20.991 --> 00:46:23.720
<v Speaker 5>We never did a true pilot episode.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cheers.</v>

992
00:46:23.810 --> 00:46:26.560
<v Speaker 5>Cit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We never did a true pilot episode.</v>

993
00:46:26.810 --> 00:46:31.810
<v Speaker 5>I pilot episode was our premier episode</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I look at some of my choices.</v>

994
00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:37.530
<v Speaker 5>I chose this weird ass closing bit on</v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

995
00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:38.301
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

996
00:46:38.301 --> 00:46:40.520
<v Speaker 5>why did I pick that as a bit?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't write it,</v>

997
00:46:40.521 --> 00:46:43.640
<v Speaker 5>but I liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes you'd like stuff in the</v>

998
00:46:43.641 --> 00:46:47.540
<v Speaker 5>writer's room that is hilarious,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then you execute that shit.</v>

999
00:46:47.550 --> 00:46:49.460
<v Speaker 5>And what were we doing?</v>

1000
00:46:49.710 --> 00:46:51.060
<v Speaker 3>Can I ask you a question?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1001
00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:53.700
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Outside of a television show,</v>

1002
00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:55.500
<v Speaker 3>if you were just sitting around and</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone said,</v>

1003
00:46:55.501 --> 00:46:57.540
<v Speaker 3>Hannibal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want you to just be your creative</v>

1004
00:46:57.541 --> 00:47:00.450
<v Speaker 3>self.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would you ever gravitate towards writing</v>

1005
00:47:00.451 --> 00:47:01.284
<v Speaker 3>sketches?</v>

1006
00:47:01.830 --> 00:47:03.170
<v Speaker 5>What I gravitate towards,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

1007
00:47:03.171 --> 00:47:06.570
<v Speaker 5>And Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just on your own.</v>

1008
00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:07.710
<v Speaker 5>Oh my own.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1009
00:47:07.711 --> 00:47:12.000
<v Speaker 5>but it was sometimes where I come up</v>
<v Speaker 5>with something that definitely works</v>

1010
00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:15.600
<v Speaker 5>better visually than,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1011
00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:17.280
<v Speaker 5>than Stan does stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1012
00:47:17.281 --> 00:47:20.810
<v Speaker 5>I try to tell a standup bit like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it will work better,</v>

1013
00:47:21.490 --> 00:47:24.450
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>visually animated or as a sketch yet.</v>

1014
00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:25.461
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely.</v>

1015
00:47:25.461 --> 00:47:26.141
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

1016
00:47:26.141 --> 00:47:28.040
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some subjects that I've had an</v>

1017
00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:30.730
<v Speaker 3>abandoned because they really did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought they were hilarious,</v>

1018
00:47:30.731 --> 00:47:31.990
<v Speaker 3>but I couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just didn't,</v>

1019
00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:37.210
<v Speaker 3>weren't there were a better idea for a</v>
<v Speaker 3>play than they would be for a standup</v>

1020
00:47:37.211 --> 00:47:38.044
<v Speaker 3>comedy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1021
00:47:38.410 --> 00:47:42.640
<v Speaker 3>But when we're coming up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody wanted to be on Saturday night</v>

1022
00:47:42.641 --> 00:47:47.641
<v Speaker 3>live because Eddie Murphy was on there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody wanted to be on sketch comedy</v>

1023
00:47:47.771 --> 00:47:52.771
<v Speaker 3>shows because that would lead to these</v>
<v Speaker 3>big careers like Adam Sandler and Rob</v>

1024
00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:56.230
<v Speaker 3>Schneider and all these people that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>became like these huge movie stars,</v>

1025
00:47:56.231 --> 00:47:59.890
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we all like gravitate towards acting</v>

1026
00:47:59.891 --> 00:48:04.210
<v Speaker 3>and then there was sitcoms where Rosanne</v>
<v Speaker 3>made all this money and then Seinfeld</v>

1027
00:48:04.211 --> 00:48:05.110
<v Speaker 3>made all this money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

1028
00:48:05.111 --> 00:48:06.020
<v Speaker 3>Oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I gotta get to.</v>

1029
00:48:06.190 --> 00:48:08.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when I was on that bad sitcom</v>

1030
00:48:08.561 --> 00:48:10.930
<v Speaker 3>halfway and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not what I wanted to do.</v>

1031
00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:12.070
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fucked up.</v>

1032
00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:16.240
<v Speaker 3>I listened to the I want to do stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it does what I want to do now with a</v>

1033
00:48:16.241 --> 00:48:19.210
<v Speaker 3>guy like you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what I want to hear as you talk</v>

1034
00:48:19.211 --> 00:48:22.840
<v Speaker 3>about everything I don't want to hear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I want to hear you doing prepared</v>

1035
00:48:22.841 --> 00:48:24.580
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If that's what you want to do.</v>

1036
00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:28.630
<v Speaker 3>Like what I would want to hear from you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I was a producer and I was a network</v>

1037
00:48:28.631 --> 00:48:30.760
<v Speaker 3>and I was comedy central,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say handle,</v>

1038
00:48:30.761 --> 00:48:31.571
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck.</v>

1039
00:48:31.571 --> 00:48:34.000

<v Speaker 3>Fuck all these producers.</v>

1040
00:48:34.330 --> 00:48:37.000

<v Speaker 3>What do you want to do?</v>

1041
00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:39.370
<v Speaker 3>I want to know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want a bunch of people filtering</v>

1042
00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:42.160
<v Speaker 3>the Hannibal Vision by the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when Doug,</v>

1043
00:48:42.161 --> 00:48:45.610
<v Speaker 3>Stan hope and I did the man show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was a giant mistake.</v>

1044
00:48:45.730 --> 00:48:50.290
<v Speaker 3>One of the big problems with was with</v>
<v Speaker 3>that show was like with Doug and I had a</v>

1045
00:48:50.291 --> 00:48:52.510
<v Speaker 3>fucked up idea by the time it would get</v>
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>

1046
00:48:52.690 --> 00:48:56.170
<v Speaker 3>It would be all watered down by the time</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd ever get to the television.</v>

1047
00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:59.200
<v Speaker 3>There's no way you could just have the</v>
<v Speaker 3>only way to do that.</v>

1048
00:48:59.201 --> 00:49:02.320
<v Speaker 3>It's like the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Internet is the only way where you</v>

1049
00:49:02.321 --> 00:49:05.020
<v Speaker 3>could just like if someone was smart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would come along and they would</v>

1050
00:49:05.021 --> 00:49:05.854
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

1051
00:49:07.170 --> 00:49:09.430
<v Speaker 3>if I was comedy central,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say animal.</v>

1052
00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:13.720
<v Speaker 3>It's just like a bunch of money and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're just going to give you a</v>

1053
00:49:13.721 --> 00:49:16.870
<v Speaker 3>production team and just come up with</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever the fuck you want to come up</v>

1054
00:49:16.871 --> 00:49:18.550
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want you to take six months.</v>

1055
00:49:18.730 --> 00:49:21.790
<v Speaker 3>Just think about what you want to do is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know it's going to be funny.</v>

1056
00:49:22.430 --> 00:49:24.790
<v Speaker 3>I think you're hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll take six months,</v>

1057
00:49:24.910 --> 00:49:26.950
<v Speaker 3>come up with whatever the fuck you want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do,</v>

1058
00:49:27.690 --> 00:49:30.670
<v Speaker 3>let's put this shit online,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do this,</v>

1059
00:49:30.730 --> 00:49:33.160
<v Speaker 3>come on mobile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then if they wanted to make a</v>

1060
00:49:33.161 --> 00:49:35.340
<v Speaker 3>television show out of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's what happened with Arisa</v>

1061
00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:36.193
<v Speaker 3>fear show.</v>

1062
00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:37.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1063
00:49:37.020 --> 00:49:42.020
<v Speaker 3>It will do it as the online thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the honestly the online's better.</v>

1064
00:49:42.220 --> 00:49:43.890
<v Speaker 3>It's better to get on the online.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1065
00:49:44.130 --> 00:49:46.990
<v Speaker 3>it's going to online.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's there always.</v>

1066
00:49:47.230 --> 00:49:50.800
<v Speaker 3>Is there any minute of any day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it's just the TV version of it.</v>

1067
00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:54.250
<v Speaker 3>I mean once it goes online then it</v>
<v Speaker 3>becomes equal to the online version,</v>

1068
00:49:54.550 --> 00:49:59.440
<v Speaker 3>but there's no like loss and not having</v>
<v Speaker 3>the TV version because like if someone</v>

1069
00:49:59.441 --> 00:50:02.790
<v Speaker 3>watches comedy central during the show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when Ariz on like what is always</v>

<v Speaker 3>million people in episode?</v>

1072
00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:09.470
<v Speaker 3>A million dollars an episode.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'd be very happy.</v>

1073
00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:11.590
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if he got a million people an</v>

1101
00:51:24.901 --> 00:51:29.370
<v Speaker 1>the idea of being on a television show</v>
<v Speaker 1>being no different than the idea of</v>

1102
00:51:29.371 --> 00:51:32.640
<v Speaker 1>being on a youtube show or even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1103
00:51:32.670 --> 00:51:37.670
<v Speaker 1>a lot of these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing some celebrities react a shell</v>

1104
00:51:38.641 --> 00:51:41.140
<v Speaker 1>on Thursday where they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1105
00:51:41.230 --> 00:51:45.210
<v Speaker 1>our viewership is four times the average</v>
<v Speaker 1>TV show,</v>

1106
00:51:45.220 --> 00:51:46.250
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

1107
00:51:46.260 --> 00:51:48.150
<v Speaker 1>in the email,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1108
00:51:48.210 --> 00:51:52.230
<v Speaker 1>they talk about their numbers like this</v>
<v Speaker 1>two times and knowing what is four times</v>

1109
00:51:52.231 --> 00:51:54.010
<v Speaker 1>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it,</v>

1110
00:51:54.030 --> 00:51:56.520
<v Speaker 1>didn't have a crazy subscriber list,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1111
00:51:56.521 --> 00:51:59.100
<v Speaker 1>in all on youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of subscribers.</v>

1112
00:51:59.740 --> 00:52:01.800
<v Speaker 1>Youtube is where it's at for a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1113
00:52:01.830 --> 00:52:03.750
<v Speaker 1>It's just a matter of we just A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1114
00:52:03.751 --> 00:52:08.751
<v Speaker 1>that's how comedy central now judges the</v>
<v Speaker 1>success of that shows not just on the,</v>

1115
00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:12.150
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on air,</v>

1116
00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:16.080
<v Speaker 1>the initial area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it judge it based on the facebook</v>

1117
00:52:16.081 --> 00:52:18.000
<v Speaker 1>shares,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the youtube stuff,</v>

1118
00:52:18.150 --> 00:52:21.550
<v Speaker 1>the snapchat thing and all that's to</v>
<v Speaker 1>come.</v>

1119
00:52:21.670 --> 00:52:26.520
<v Speaker 1>It's a combined a formula they use to</v>
<v Speaker 1>judge the successful show.</v>

1120
00:52:26.970 --> 00:52:28.140
<v Speaker 1>It's smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1121
00:52:28.170 --> 00:52:30.570
<v Speaker 1>that's really the way to think about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they have to be honest.</v>

1122
00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:33.570
<v Speaker 1>This is a giant percentage of the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are gonna Watch her show on youtube</v>

1123
00:52:34.170 --> 00:52:35.850

<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1124

<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many people watch</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy central Dot Com.</v>

1125
00:52:38.941 --> 00:52:42.000

<v Speaker 1>I would imagine it's not nearly as much</v>

1126
00:52:42.001 --> 00:52:45.570
<v Speaker 1>as youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what's amazing about youtube is</v>

<v Speaker 1>that are based on.</v>

1134
00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:07.050

<v Speaker 4>here's some perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The UFC sold for 4 billion.</v>

1155
00:54:04.370 --> 00:54:09.370
<v Speaker 4>It's more valuable to kick people in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The deq and the head an elbow in the</v>

1156
00:54:09.991 --> 00:54:13.110
<v Speaker 4>face than it is to create youtube.</v>

1157
00:54:13.610 --> 00:54:15.080
<v Speaker 10>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I looked something up on it the other</v>

1158
00:54:15.081 --> 00:54:16.490
<v Speaker 10>day.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I think that's why there's numbers were</v>

1159
00:54:16.491 --> 00:54:17.990
<v Speaker 10>stuck in my head.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It's a,</v>

1160
00:54:18.260 --> 00:54:21.980
<v Speaker 10>at least from what I read at cost,</v>
<v Speaker 10>something like six point $7,000,000,000</v>

1161
00:54:22.010 --> 00:54:24.530
<v Speaker 10>to run youtube right now every year,</v>
<v Speaker 10>year.</v>

1162
00:54:24.531 --> 00:54:26.750
<v Speaker 10>And like the revenue they're getting my</v>
<v Speaker 10>baby just from ads.</v>

1163
00:54:26.751 --> 00:54:29.630
<v Speaker 10>It's like less than 5 billion.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So they're taking a loss on it.</v>

1164
00:54:29.631 --> 00:54:32.540
<v Speaker 10>But why is,</v>
<v Speaker 10>that's just for doing the future bet.</v>

1165
00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:35.060
<v Speaker 10>Kinda like it won't be that for four or</v>
<v Speaker 10>five more years.</v>

1166
00:54:35.061 --> 00:54:35.850
<v Speaker 10>It's just how it happened.</v>

1167
00:54:35.850 --> 00:54:37.650
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that's why there's only one youtube.</v>

1168
00:54:38.620 --> 00:54:40.370
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking tough,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but</v>

1169
00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:44.250
<v Speaker 4>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing though.</v>

1170
00:54:44.251 --> 00:54:47.670
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you want to talk about an incredible</v>

1171
00:54:48.750 --> 00:54:53.370
<v Speaker 4>example of success,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like youtube is the only video upstream</v>

1172
00:54:53.371 --> 00:54:57.990
<v Speaker 4>place that everybody or upload place</v>
<v Speaker 4>that everybody recognizes instantly in</v>

1173
00:54:57.991 --> 00:55:01.680
<v Speaker 4>the sea of the Internet is a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's incredible.</v>

1174
00:55:01.740 --> 00:55:04.890
<v Speaker 4>As top management.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They do do some shit.</v>

1175
00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:06.690
<v Speaker 4>You do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you do ads with them?</v>

1176
00:55:07.010 --> 00:55:07.640
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1177
00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:09.720
<v Speaker 4>I mean they put up ads but I don't have</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything to do with it.</v>

1178
00:55:10.250 --> 00:55:13.350
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we do just adds on this show and then we</v>

1179
00:55:13.351 --> 00:55:15.450
<v Speaker 4>upload the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the difference between the Youtube</v>

1180
00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:18.030
<v Speaker 4>version of this show and the podcast</v>
<v Speaker 4>version.</v>

1181
00:55:18.390 --> 00:55:20.310
<v Speaker 4>The podcast version has,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1182
00:55:20.940 --> 00:55:21.773
<v Speaker 4>has,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1183
00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:24.780
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>adds that we read,</v>

1184
00:55:24.860 --> 00:55:25.510
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like from,</v>

1185
00:55:25.510 --> 00:55:27.660
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a promo,</v>

1186
00:55:27.661 --> 00:55:31.440
<v Speaker 4>a email thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then the youtube one has no ads.</v>

1187
00:55:31.650 --> 00:55:32.460
<v Speaker 4>It just goes up.</v>

1188
00:55:32.460 --> 00:55:36.650
<v Speaker 4>And then whatever ads,</v>
<v Speaker 4>youtube ads and ads for.</v>

1189
00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:40.500
<v Speaker 4>I took someone with a on it Zealand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I'm feeling,</v>

1190
00:55:40.501 --> 00:55:41.450
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe the,</v>

1191
00:55:41.570 --> 00:55:46.080
<v Speaker 4>the whiskey is cancelling it out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but maybe I'm just normal now.</v>

1192
00:55:46.081 --> 00:55:47.820
<v Speaker 4>I'm feeling a little drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm good.</v>

1193
00:55:48.180 --> 00:55:50.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just not going to help the drunk too</v>

1194
00:55:50.611 --> 00:55:53.250
<v Speaker 4>much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it'll help you formulate</v>

1195
00:55:53.251 --> 00:55:54.360
<v Speaker 4>sentences.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Meanwhile,</v>

1196
00:55:54.570 --> 00:55:56.770
<v Speaker 4>the word formulate came out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Very clumsy.</v>

1197
00:55:58.200 --> 00:56:01.890
<v Speaker 4>Formulate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You ever been to Israel?</v>

1198
00:56:02.170 --> 00:56:04.380
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you know?</v>

1199
00:56:04.780 --> 00:56:07.470
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got offered a Gig and Israel don't go</v>

1200
00:56:07.830 --> 00:56:09.590
<v Speaker 4>in June.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Reactionary.</v>

1201
00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:12.040
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You should go to.</v>

1202
00:56:12.060 --> 00:56:14.160
<v Speaker 4>Sure you took it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I took the Gig.</v>

1203
00:56:14.630 --> 00:56:16.740
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when is it for?</v>

1204
00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:19.860
<v Speaker 4>It was supposed to be in Gillette.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Supposed to be spoiler alert</v>

1205
00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:24.290
<v Speaker 4>on earth lead,</v>

1206
00:56:24.820 --> 00:56:29.820
<v Speaker 5>but still an interesting story.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I so took this gig in Israel in Tel Aviv</v>

1207
00:56:31.510 --> 00:56:36.400
<v Speaker 5>only because my ex girlfriend is Israeli</v>
<v Speaker 5>is Israeli.</v>

1208
00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:38.380
<v Speaker 5>And so I'm thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck,</v>

1209
00:56:38.381 --> 00:56:41.210
<v Speaker 5>you have a machine gun in your mouth?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1210
00:56:45.290 --> 00:56:47.580
<v Speaker 5>she's</v>
<v Speaker 5>Israeli.</v>

1211
00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:49.120
<v Speaker 5>I'm thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

1212
00:56:49.150 --> 00:56:51.910
<v Speaker 5>maybe she wants to come on this trip</v>
<v Speaker 5>with me.</v>

1213
00:56:52.110 --> 00:56:53.890
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll take this,</v>

1214
00:56:53.950 --> 00:56:58.950
<v Speaker 5>I'll take this and a well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then I took the Gig,</v>

1215
00:56:59.740 --> 00:57:01.210
<v Speaker 5>turns out she was mad because he was</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1216
00:57:01.211 --> 00:57:03.850
<v Speaker 5>you didn't go to Tel Aviv with me when</v>
<v Speaker 5>we were together.</v>

1217
00:57:06.820 --> 00:57:10.540
<v Speaker 5>So now I got this Gig in Tel Aviv,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this not even routed with anything else.</v>

1218
00:57:11.350 --> 00:57:14.830
<v Speaker 5>And then I started getting these tweets</v>
<v Speaker 5>when people,</v>

1219
00:57:15.710 --> 00:57:18.370
<v Speaker 5>why are you going to Tel Aviv?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you know what they're doing to the</v>

1220
00:57:18.371 --> 00:57:22.410
<v Speaker 5>Palestinian people supporting genocide?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

1221
00:57:23.260 --> 00:57:25.520
<v Speaker 5>I was just trying to get back on my ex</v>
<v Speaker 5>girlfriend.</v>

1222
00:57:26.370 --> 00:57:29.530
<v Speaker 5>Be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you are supporting hate.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I just heard he was dope beaches.</v>

1225
00:57:39.110 --> 00:57:41.370
<v Speaker 5>I was getting all these.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>boycotting Israel.</v>

1228
00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:51.070
<v Speaker 5>Is that common a boy?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it was like I live.</v>

1229
00:57:51.071 --> 00:57:53.110
<v Speaker 5>I think it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was a bunch of other people that</v>

1230
00:57:53.140 --> 00:57:56.830

00:58:10.740 --> 00:58:12.630
<v Speaker 5>But yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it was just fun and getting all of</v>

1238
00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:15.760
<v Speaker 5>these angry political tweets.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Can I be sympathetic and also maybe do</v>

1241
00:58:21.341 --> 00:58:22.840
<v Speaker 5>this gig.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I ended up canceling Gig,</v>

1242
00:58:22.841 --> 00:58:27.841
<v Speaker 5>but now because of the tweets and the</v>
<v Speaker 5>anger was just because I booked a movie</v>

1243
00:58:27.971 --> 00:58:28.960
<v Speaker 5>that completely with it,</v>

1244
00:58:29.870 --> 00:58:31.700
<v Speaker 4>the movie was more important than in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>motherland.</v>

1245
00:58:31.910 --> 00:58:33.350
<v Speaker 4>But let me ask you this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Honestly.</v>

1246
00:58:33.351 --> 00:58:36.320
<v Speaker 4>If the girl was going to go with you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he knew you're going to get your freak</v>

1247
00:58:36.321 --> 00:58:38.180

<v Speaker 4>movie?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you?</v>

1249
00:58:39.110 --> 00:58:42.890
<v Speaker 4>Would you have broken her heart and not</v>
<v Speaker 4>taking her back to the motherland?</v>

1250
00:58:43.270 --> 00:58:45.380
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't send the back another time.</v>

00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:16.190
<v Speaker 4>that's a good move though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Take her another time.</v>

1260
00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:21.260
<v Speaker 4>But did you guys communicate afterwards?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you settle down to the issue that</v>

1261
00:59:21.261 --> 00:59:22.100
<v Speaker 4>you never took her to go</v>

1262
00:59:22.220 --> 00:59:24.090
<v Speaker 3>to Israel?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why you guys settled?</v>

1263
00:59:24.150 --> 00:59:28.880

<v Speaker 3>you can't settle down and you just work</v>

1264
00:59:28.881 --> 00:59:30.620
<v Speaker 3>on what you can work on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Recreational outrage and let me pose a</v>

1266
00:59:34.281 --> 00:59:35.330
<v Speaker 3>scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1292
01:00:51.230 --> 01:00:54.260

01:01:10.310 --> 01:01:12.980
<v Speaker 3>If you take mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you stick your head and you pop it back</v>

<v Speaker 2>I said you try to get the pipe just to,</v>

1386
01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:34.980
<v Speaker 2>just to see what the tone is</v>

01:05:36.730 --> 01:05:41.250
<v Speaker 2>that's a reference to a Jr Smith for</v>
<v Speaker 2>basketball player.</v>

1388

<v Speaker 2>You could see him,</v>

1402
01:06:20.290 --> 01:06:21.940
<v Speaker 2>but her face is blurred out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1403
01:06:22.060 --> 01:06:26.110

<v Speaker 2>parties.</v>

1404
01:06:26.230 --> 01:06:29.320
<v Speaker 2>If you want to put this up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't hide the darkness.</v>

1405
01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:32.210
<v Speaker 2>We should be able to know who you are</v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

1406
01:06:32.710 --> 01:06:35.020
<v Speaker 2>That's a weird thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>but they don't want to.</v>

1422
01:07:11.940 --> 01:07:14.190
<v Speaker 2>Let's think about their point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their point.</v>

<v Speaker 2>They want to play it cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to keep some innuendo and keep</v>

1425
01:07:18.701 --> 01:07:22.540
<v Speaker 2>it subtle and I get that and sometimes I</v>
<v Speaker 2>play along with that Shit Shit to say.</v>

<v Speaker 2>and then when everything goes down I</v>

1428

<v Speaker 2>break.</v>

1481

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard being a Groupie,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1485
01:10:17.390 --> 01:10:18.820
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard.</v>

1486
01:10:18.850 --> 01:10:23.850
<v Speaker 1>It's hard being a person in person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Navigating these waters is weird waters</v>

01:10:24.810 --> 01:10:26.050
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for everybody.</v>

1488
01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:28.180
<v Speaker 1>And I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get the energy is bad.</v>

1489
01:10:28.260 --> 01:10:29.880
<v Speaker 1>Something that bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just as a,</v>

1490
01:10:30.310 --> 01:10:31.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's weird thing,</v>

1491
01:10:31.570 --> 01:10:33.740
<v Speaker 1>here's what's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People don't even know why they're</v>

1492
01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:36.070
<v Speaker 1>attracted to certain people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't understand it,</v>

1493
01:10:36.550 --> 01:10:38.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they try to quantify it.</v>

1494
01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:40.510
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1496
01:10:42.221 --> 01:10:45.520
<v Speaker 1>to people in weird ways and then they</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost want to test the waters.</v>

1497
01:10:45.550 --> 01:10:46.780
<v Speaker 1>I want to meet you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hannibal.</v>

1498
01:10:46.970 --> 01:10:48.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's even.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's attractive.</v>

1499
01:10:48.971 --> 01:10:50.950
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a straight up.</v>

1500
01:10:51.490 --> 01:10:55.080
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's attracted and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it's just straight up your</v>

1501
01:10:55.090 --> 01:10:57.850
<v Speaker 1>personal television.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your personal stage could be that you</v>

1502
01:10:57.851 --> 01:10:59.860
<v Speaker 1>have to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are a lot of them were like</v>

1503
01:10:59.861 --> 01:11:01.300
<v Speaker 1>really young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1504
01:11:01.301 --> 01:11:05.110
<v Speaker 1>if a person's 24 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much do they really understand</v>

1505
01:11:05.380 --> 01:11:08.610
<v Speaker 1>completely about their motivations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1506
01:11:08.710 --> 01:11:11.570
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or when someone's 22 w,</v>

1507
01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:14.340
<v Speaker 1>w you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times it's like on instinct</v>

1508
01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:18.030
<v Speaker 3>and then you're sort of self correcting</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you go along,</v>

1509
01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:19.073
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1510
01:11:22.850 --> 01:11:26.210
<v Speaker 2>Does that make any sense?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just do.</v>

1511
01:11:26.220 --> 01:11:31.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean made still occasionally make</v>
<v Speaker 2>decisions.</v>

1512
01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:32.170
<v Speaker 2>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the.</v>

1513
01:11:32.250 --> 01:11:33.083
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

1514
01:11:33.650 --> 01:11:36.380
<v Speaker 2>Why did I let that person in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>apartment?</v>

1515
01:11:36.410 --> 01:11:38.300
<v Speaker 2>You drink.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should've gotten a hotel room.</v>

1516
01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:41.780
<v Speaker 2>It's the drinking drank and God dammit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're drunk right now.</v>

1517
01:11:42.700 --> 01:11:47.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to say I'm drunk at buzz buzz.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are big gas drinks I poured and</v>

1518
01:11:47.990 --> 01:11:51.980
<v Speaker 2>this is really not smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Put this on the Internet about to.</v>

1519
01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:54.840
<v Speaker 2>We're about to give them beamed up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man</v>

1520
01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:58.550
<v Speaker 2>up and clipped up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clip it up.</v>

1521
01:11:58.670 --> 01:12:00.980
<v Speaker 2>We can handle this together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They going to say we're going to be</v>

1522
01:12:00.981 --> 01:12:03.980
<v Speaker 2>pilot and copilot massaging this</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedian,</v>

1523
01:12:03.981 --> 01:12:05.180
<v Speaker 2>Hannibal burress</v>

1524
01:12:07.100 --> 01:12:09.770
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your unfiltered and everybody wants to</v>

1525
01:12:09.771 --> 01:12:12.040
<v Speaker 3>be unfiltered,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but nobody wants unfiltered.</v>

1526
01:12:12.210 --> 01:12:14.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody wants unfiltered,</v>

1527
01:12:14.630 --> 01:12:17.630
<v Speaker 3>but there's a lot of people that don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>want unfiltered and they want you to</v>

1528
01:12:17.631 --> 01:12:21.680
<v Speaker 3>think that nobody wants unfilter yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're not saying anything that I</v>

1529
01:12:21.681 --> 01:12:24.680
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't expect you to say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we were alone and the microphones</v>

1530
01:12:24.681 --> 01:12:27.190
<v Speaker 3>were off of you and I were hanging out</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the comedy store,</v>

1531
01:12:27.210 --> 01:12:30.170
<v Speaker 3>we'd have the same conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be laughed at the exact same way.</v>

1532
01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:33.180
<v Speaker 2>Actually we would because it be a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 2>of other comedians,</v>

1533
01:12:33.210 --> 01:12:38.130
<v Speaker 2>ear hustling and I went into just them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you'll tell it online.</v>

1534
01:12:38.150 --> 01:12:38.671
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it is.</v>

1535
01:12:38.671 --> 01:12:39.570
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>

1536
01:12:39.690 --> 01:12:41.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm more like this doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does seem.</v>

1537
01:12:41.850 --> 01:12:45.840
<v Speaker 2>It seems even though obviously it's way</v>
<v Speaker 2>more people listening and watching,</v>

1538
01:12:45.841 --> 01:12:48.720
<v Speaker 2>but it's more about the visual of other</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1539
01:12:48.870 --> 01:12:51.060
<v Speaker 2>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you having a conversation with somebody</v>

1540
01:12:51.061 --> 01:12:53.800
<v Speaker 2>and then you feel other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not part of the conversation</v>

1541
01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:59.760
<v Speaker 2>where that feels more unnatural to me</v>
<v Speaker 2>than doing this.</v>

1542
01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:02.220
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree a thousand percent.</v>

1543
01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:03.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it probably doesn't make any sense.</v>

1544
01:13:04.020 --> 01:13:07.230
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make any sense at all.</v>

1545
01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:09.040
<v Speaker 2>It.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's like</v>

1546
01:13:10.510 --> 01:13:13.840
<v Speaker 3>I think like it's not their fault if</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone's hanging around us.</v>

1547
01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:19.300
<v Speaker 3>There's been situations like that before</v>
<v Speaker 3>where someone is like weaseled into a</v>

1548
01:13:19.301 --> 01:13:23.650
<v Speaker 3>conversation between me or you or me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was me and des and some other dude</v>

1549
01:13:23.651 --> 01:13:27.550
<v Speaker 3>the other night and this guy came up to</v>
<v Speaker 3>us and just sandwiches way into a</v>

1550
01:13:27.551 --> 01:13:29.490
<v Speaker 3>conversation in the kitchen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1551
01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:31.540
<v Speaker 3>how'd you get back here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come on man.</v>

1552
01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:34.270
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but part of me,</v>

1553
01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:37.950
<v Speaker 3>part of me thinks like if I was that</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy,</v>

1554
01:13:37.951 --> 01:13:41.220
<v Speaker 3>how would I do it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you do if you walk up,</v>

1555
01:13:42.350 --> 01:13:42.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1556
01:13:42.980 --> 01:13:45.660
<v Speaker 3>you were at the comedy store,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're supposed to go left to take a</v>

1557
01:13:45.661 --> 01:13:50.661
<v Speaker 3>leak and you go right and you're into</v>
<v Speaker 3>the kitchen and Joey Diaz is talking to</v>

1558
01:13:51.631 --> 01:13:56.520
<v Speaker 3>Ari Shaffir and Hannibal and you guys</v>
<v Speaker 3>were all hanging out and hilarious</v>

1559
01:13:56.521 --> 01:14:00.720
<v Speaker 3>fucking stories are being told and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>just want to stand there and stare.</v>

1560
01:14:02.150 --> 01:14:02.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to.</v>

1561
01:14:03.050 --> 01:14:04.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean you listen to it.</v>

1562
01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:07.210
<v Speaker 3>I would do it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll do it right now if those guys hated</v>

1563
01:14:07.211 --> 01:14:10.090
<v Speaker 3>me for some reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those guys wouldn't be my friends</v>

1564
01:14:10.091 --> 01:14:10.840
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1565
01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:12.010
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the fuck I did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

1566
01:14:12.310 --> 01:14:13.930
<v Speaker 4>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to find a hole in this vent so I</v>

1567
01:14:13.931 --> 01:14:15.400
<v Speaker 4>could listen in on and talk</v>

1568
01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:20.680
<v Speaker 5>two and a lot of weight is interacts as</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had lit a fad,</v>

1569
01:14:21.010 --> 01:14:26.010
<v Speaker 5>which I have a lot because I go out a</v>
<v Speaker 5>lot and go drinking and so I'm super</v>

1570
01:14:27.311 --> 01:14:30.160
<v Speaker 5>exposed to all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1571
01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:35.880
<v Speaker 5>but I was in Chattanooga last year.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We played this venue and we go out</v>

1572
01:14:38.561 --> 01:14:40.390
<v Speaker 5>afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Me,</v>

1573
01:14:40.870 --> 01:14:42.550

<v Speaker 5>I'm a boy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Marcus,</v>

1575
01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:48.370
<v Speaker 5>a couple of girls we met and we go to</v>
<v Speaker 5>this bar,</v>

1576
01:14:49.030 --> 01:14:51.700
<v Speaker 5>nice bar.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not that many people that maybe 12,</v>

1577
01:14:51.701 --> 01:14:55.120
<v Speaker 5>15 people in the whole bar this big as</v>
<v Speaker 5>pool tables over on this side.</v>

1578
01:14:55.900 --> 01:14:58.180
<v Speaker 5>Bars here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They had these wings.</v>

1579
01:14:58.181 --> 01:15:00.880
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these smoked wings that I was eating</v>

1580
01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:06.070
<v Speaker 5>maybe the best ways I've had top five,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I'm crushing them.</v>

1581
01:15:06.130 --> 01:15:09.040
<v Speaker 5>It was a spiritual experience.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's so good about them?</v>

1582
01:15:09.330 --> 01:15:11.500
<v Speaker 5>They just well made.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were grilled.</v>

1583
01:15:11.980 --> 01:15:14.870
<v Speaker 5>They were cooked well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wish I remember the name was,</v>

1584
01:15:14.930 --> 01:15:17.140
<v Speaker 5>but it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the wings were so good ground.</v>

1585
01:15:17.230 --> 01:15:19.900
<v Speaker 5>I'm just killing these wing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>marinated in the zone.</v>

1586
01:15:19.930 --> 01:15:21.790

<v Speaker 5>had good sauce.</v>

1587
01:15:21.850 --> 01:15:23.380
<v Speaker 5>Hot.</v>

1599
01:15:43.261 --> 01:15:45.810
<v Speaker 5>Let's just give me a few minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm happy to take a picture.</v>

1600
01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:46.471
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>come on man,</v>

1601
01:15:46.471 --> 01:15:47.650
<v Speaker 5>let me take a picture.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was just telling me,</v>

1602
01:15:48.090 --> 01:15:49.350
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm eating right now.</v>

<v Speaker 5>let me just finish eating.</v>

1604
01:15:51.510 --> 01:15:53.970
<v Speaker 5>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>would you rather me take a wing or take</v>

1605
01:15:53.971 --> 01:15:55.590
<v Speaker 5>a picture?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I said,</v>

1606
01:15:55.950 --> 01:15:57.660
<v Speaker 5>I'd rather you get the fuck out of my</v>
<v Speaker 5>face.</v>

1607
01:15:57.661 --> 01:16:01.710
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1609
01:16:04.290 --> 01:16:08.160
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't like a meet and greet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I told him I was happy to take a picture</v>

<v Speaker 5>I had sauce all over my hands and shit.</v>

1612
01:16:11.610 --> 01:16:13.020
<v Speaker 5>It's like they'll give it a few</v>
<v Speaker 5>reasonable.</v>

1613
01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:15.430
<v Speaker 5>Give me a few minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He asked.</v>

1614
01:16:15.431 --> 01:16:18.840
<v Speaker 5>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He asked cooler and I'm reasonable about</v>

1615
01:16:18.841 --> 01:16:21.490
<v Speaker 5>it and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you know a little bit.</v>

1616
01:16:21.570 --> 01:16:25.440
<v Speaker 5>I know he's doing a bunch about it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so on the other side of the bar,</v>

1617
01:16:25.860 --> 01:16:28.450
<v Speaker 5>it's another bigger space with the where</v>
<v Speaker 5>the bathroom is.</v>

1618
01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:33.480

<v Speaker 5>it's a long space is before you get to</v>

1621
01:16:41.701 --> 01:16:44.550
<v Speaker 5>the interest of the bar again and I get</v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

1622
01:16:44.790 --> 01:16:46.650
<v Speaker 5>He's standing by the bathroom door.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He yells,</v>

1634
01:17:15.410 --> 01:17:18.500
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if Dave Chappelle was mean to me when I</v>

1635
01:17:18.580 --> 01:17:20.300
<v Speaker 2>had kept bothering him while he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>eating,</v>

1636
01:17:20.340 --> 01:17:21.540
<v Speaker 2>I'd get it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you,</v>

1637
01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:25.160
<v Speaker 2>you have to give me your day day span.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You paid for a show.</v>

01:17:27.860 --> 01:17:30.230
<v Speaker 2>You didn't pay for fucking meet and</v>
<v Speaker 2>greet.</v>

1640
01:17:30.530 --> 01:17:34.490
<v Speaker 2>I told you I take the fucking picture</v>
<v Speaker 2>with you after I was done eating.</v>

1641
01:17:34.491 --> 01:17:39.350
<v Speaker 2>Then you kept pressing me and so he</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitched about the $25 or whatever.</v>

1642
01:17:39.351 --> 01:17:42.490
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm like sitting and stewing,</v>

<v Speaker 2>This motherfucker.</v>

1644
01:17:43.790 --> 01:17:46.040
<v Speaker 2>I told him I'd take a picture with this</v>
<v Speaker 2>barn even crowded.</v>

1645
01:17:46.041 --> 01:17:47.990
<v Speaker 2>It would have been easier to take a</v>
<v Speaker 2>picture with her if he just fucking</v>

1646
01:17:47.991 --> 01:17:52.991
<v Speaker 2>relax and then I can take $25 out of my</v>
<v Speaker 2>pocket.</v>

1647
01:17:55.340 --> 01:17:57.090
<v Speaker 2>I balled it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's over at the pool table.</v>

1648
01:17:57.090 --> 01:18:01.610
<v Speaker 2>I woke up and I throw it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take your money back if that's what you</v>

1649
01:18:01.660 --> 01:18:03.220
<v Speaker 2>wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then he picked.</v>

1650
01:18:03.250 --> 01:18:04.820
<v Speaker 2>He throws it back everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I balled it up,</v>

1651
01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:07.150
<v Speaker 2>hit him in the face with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my goodness.</v>

1652
01:18:07.151 --> 01:18:09.470
<v Speaker 2>And then they were ready to fight and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was ready to fight the dude,</v>

1653
01:18:09.471 --> 01:18:12.200
<v Speaker 2>but then his brother was there and while</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was all going on,</v>

1654
01:18:12.201 --> 01:18:13.580
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>

1657
01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:25.190
<v Speaker 2>I was ready to punch dude acts and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>his friend pulled out a camera phone</v>

1658
01:18:25.191 --> 01:18:25.551
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Twenty five bucks.</v>

1662
01:18:31.700 --> 01:18:33.530
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't about the 25 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was about,</v>

1663
01:18:33.590 --> 01:18:37.310
<v Speaker 2>about the words about to just talk and</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit and just acting like I wasn't.</v>

1664
01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:40.670
<v Speaker 2>I was being totally chill in and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm happy to take a picture with you.</v>

1667
01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:48.980
<v Speaker 2>And he kept pressing me and then he</v>
<v Speaker 2>popped off afterwards.</v>

1668
01:18:48.981 --> 01:18:50.030
<v Speaker 2>After that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought we settled it.</v>

1669
01:18:50.490 --> 01:18:52.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what you mean,</v>

1670
01:18:52.021 --> 01:18:55.170

1671
01:18:55.171 --> 01:18:56.820
<v Speaker 3>while you're eating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is annoying,</v>

1672
01:18:57.660 --> 01:19:00.000
<v Speaker 3>but I've always tried to try to figure</v>
<v Speaker 3>out like,</v>

1673
01:19:00.001 --> 01:19:00.511
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

<v Speaker 3>what's the difference between how weird</v>

1675
01:19:03.691 --> 01:19:04.590
<v Speaker 3>it is for me</v>

1676

<v Speaker 2>eating for off to me that is better at</v>
<v Speaker 2>that too.</v>

1677
01:19:08.290 --> 01:19:11.910
<v Speaker 2>Over time where I put myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's weird in a spot and I,</v>

1678
01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:16.840
<v Speaker 2>and I'm nice and I remember and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember what it is to them for them to,</v>

1679
01:19:16.940 --> 01:19:17.870
<v Speaker 2>to ask for that.</v>

1680
01:19:17.900 --> 01:19:18.621
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Listen man,</v>

1681
01:19:18.621 --> 01:19:21.980
<v Speaker 3>I got a man crush on Anthony Bourdain</v>
<v Speaker 3>that every time I hang around with them</v>

1682
01:19:21.981 --> 01:19:22.814
<v Speaker 3>I feel goofy.</v>

1683
01:19:24.930 --> 01:19:26.690
<v Speaker 3>It's just a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just like,</v>

1684
01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:30.180
<v Speaker 3>like I think I liked the way he thinks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like his balls.</v>

1685
01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:33.120
<v Speaker 3>Guy Takes up Jujitsu when he's 58 years</v>
<v Speaker 3>old,</v>

1686
01:19:33.780 --> 01:19:34.940

<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1687
01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:40.400
<v Speaker 3>like I think in certain situations you</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to understand that like the way you</v>

1688
01:19:40.951 --> 01:19:45.420
<v Speaker 3>feel around someone is affected by your</v>
<v Speaker 3>respect for them.</v>

1689
01:19:45.421 --> 01:19:47.150
<v Speaker 3>And sometimes it gets weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1690
01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:48.510
<v Speaker 3>Like if a dude comes up to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1691
01:19:48.511 --> 01:19:49.600
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hannibal Fan,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm eating right now,</v>

1693
01:19:52.261 --> 01:19:53.490
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>relax.</v>

1694
01:19:53.491 --> 01:19:56.010
<v Speaker 3>And that they don't even know what the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck they're saying.</v>

1695
01:19:56.340 --> 01:19:57.160
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if,</v>

1696
01:19:57.160 --> 01:20:01.380
<v Speaker 3>if I'm a Hannibal Fan and I walk up and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got a mouthful wings and was just</v>

1697
01:20:01.381 --> 01:20:02.940
<v Speaker 3>this real quick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll just take this picture.</v>

1698
01:20:02.941 --> 01:20:06.060
<v Speaker 3>I've got the fuck out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe I took this chance.</v>

1699
01:20:06.300 --> 01:20:07.980
<v Speaker 5>But I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I told them,</v>

1700
01:20:07.981 --> 01:20:08.790
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1701
01:20:08.790 --> 01:20:13.790
<v Speaker 5>but I get that side of it and that's why</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wish I didn't react like that and I</v>

1702
01:20:14.180 --> 01:20:18.630
<v Speaker 5>wish I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I kept a chill and what I do more often</v>

1703
01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:19.421
<v Speaker 5>now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But.</v>

1704
01:20:19.421 --> 01:20:20.260
<v Speaker 5>So it's just,</v>

1705
01:20:20.370 --> 01:20:22.810
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what you just said is</v>
<v Speaker 3>beautiful.</v>

1706
01:20:23.020 --> 01:20:26.570
<v Speaker 3>I do more often now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're thinking about it.</v>

1707
01:20:27.070 --> 01:20:27.920
<v Speaker 3>I'm aware of it</v>

1708
01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:30.800
<v Speaker 5>need me to come up to me and just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1709
01:20:31.010 --> 01:20:35.600
<v Speaker 5>and I just remember what it is that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that and that it is a,</v>

1710
01:20:35.750 --> 01:20:37.580
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a privilege that they,</v>

1711

<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>support my work and,</v>

1712
01:20:39.060 --> 01:20:42.860
<v Speaker 5>and try to just give them that moment</v>
<v Speaker 5>versus.</v>

1713
01:20:43.050 --> 01:20:47.580
<v Speaker 5>But even still,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some mother fuckers I genuinely root and</v>

1714
01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:52.600
<v Speaker 5>sometimes people can be entitled and</v>
<v Speaker 5>sometimes people don't care if you're</v>

1715
01:20:53.420 --> 01:20:54.770
<v Speaker 5>talking to three women,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

<v Speaker 3>They will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they will bust that shit up.</v>

1717
01:21:00.660 --> 01:21:02.610
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1718
01:21:02.611 --> 01:21:05.910
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the things about life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You never know who you're going to run</v>

1719
01:21:05.911 --> 01:21:08.310
<v Speaker 3>into.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You run into someone that's just goofy.</v>

1720
01:21:08.370 --> 01:21:10.070
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 5>It's just an interest in Lens,</v>

1723
01:21:15.170 --> 01:21:15.820
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1724

<v Speaker 3>it's an interesting Lens,</v>

1725
01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:22.680
<v Speaker 3>not just for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also for me to look through what</v>

1726
01:21:23.231 --> 01:21:25.750
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But for other people too as well.</v>

1727
01:21:26.180 --> 01:21:26.801
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1730
01:21:29.261 --> 01:21:33.430
<v Speaker 3>We're all just surviving in this strange</v>
<v Speaker 3>life that's temporary.</v>

1731
01:21:34.090 --> 01:21:39.090
<v Speaker 3>If we're lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we get a hundred years if you're lucky.</v>

1732
01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:43.540

1735
01:21:52.091 --> 01:21:54.700
<v Speaker 3>So you let go and slip into the abyss.</v>

1736
01:21:55.280 --> 01:21:57.260
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I try to keep the perspective,</v>

<v Speaker 5>especially in this business willing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is a.</v>

1738
01:22:00.860 --> 01:22:04.190

1765
01:23:17.831 --> 01:23:21.070
<v Speaker 2>mutual funds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I looked at what a mutual fund is</v>

1766
01:23:21.071 --> 01:23:23.310
<v Speaker 2>with other people buying stocks,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Then I found this company started</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking it up.</v>

1787
01:24:29.181 --> 01:24:31.610
<v Speaker 2>I found them by accident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found them on accident,</v>

1788
01:24:31.611 --> 01:24:36.260
<v Speaker 2>started looking it up and I uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I invested in of heavily.</v>

1789
01:24:36.980 --> 01:24:40.340
<v Speaker 2>That's a very good move to do you want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be my manager.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1804
01:25:24.700 --> 01:25:26.570

<v Speaker 2>I like catapult,</v>

1805

<v Speaker 2>you just blew catapult the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked when you just did.</v>

1807
01:25:33.970 --> 01:25:35.200
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a solid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1808
01:25:35.201 --> 01:25:36.430
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't,</v>

1809
01:25:36.940 --> 01:25:38.850
<v Speaker 2>I've told friends about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They like it too.</v>

1810
01:25:38.910 --> 01:25:43.610
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's still early in the company and they</v>

1811
01:25:43.690 --> 01:25:46.430
<v Speaker 2>got offices in the states.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They based in Australia,</v>

1812
01:25:46.460 --> 01:25:47.170
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1813
01:25:47.170 --> 01:25:49.360
<v Speaker 2>if I don't know what the fuck it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>explaining it to me.</v>

01:25:49.510 --> 01:25:53.860
<v Speaker 2>What does it mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wearable GPS technology.</v>

1815
01:25:53.890 --> 01:25:56.470
<v Speaker 2>Now if I'm an idiot and I'm hearing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1816
01:25:56.480 --> 01:25:57.190
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1817
01:25:57.190 --> 01:26:02.190
<v Speaker 2>So you use a satellite to track the</v>
<v Speaker 2>movement of the performance,</v>

1818
01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:03.940
<v Speaker 2>like heart rate,</v>

1819
01:26:04.790 --> 01:26:06.310
<v Speaker 1>a workload?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1820
01:26:06.380 --> 01:26:09.620
<v Speaker 1>Sap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all done through like what an ankle</v>

1821
01:26:09.621 --> 01:26:10.640
<v Speaker 1>bracelet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what do you,</v>

1822
01:26:10.670 --> 01:26:13.370
<v Speaker 1>what do you put on them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that chest.</v>

1823
01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:16.870
<v Speaker 1>How do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you know what the exertion is?</v>

1824
01:26:16.871 --> 01:26:21.390
<v Speaker 1>Is it a vest outside vest?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it okay?</v>

1825
01:26:21.430 --> 01:26:22.400
<v Speaker 1>It's a little picture of what that</v>
<v Speaker 1>means.</v>

1826
01:26:22.490 --> 01:26:24.260
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy.</v>

1827
01:26:24.350 --> 01:26:26.930
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you were showing me earlier.</v>

1828
01:26:27.290 --> 01:26:28.280
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's different.</v>

1829
01:26:28.340 --> 01:26:29.450
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>

1830
01:26:29.660 --> 01:26:34.660
<v Speaker 1>This dude just got like a chest harness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I'm sure could measure.</v>

1831
01:26:35.630 --> 01:26:37.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like energy.</v>

1832
01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:42.410
<v Speaker 1>What would it measure?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does something on your chest measure</v>

1833
01:26:42.411 --> 01:26:44.180
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing with your legs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>how do those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1835
01:26:44.961 --> 01:26:49.961
<v Speaker 1>iphone apps measure your strides and how</v>
<v Speaker 1>many steps you take and you can do it</v>

1836
01:26:49.971 --> 01:26:51.130
<v Speaker 1>off of like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

1837
01:26:51.140 --> 01:26:54.020
<v Speaker 1>it's not easy math,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they can tell how far off,</v>

1838
01:26:54.110 --> 01:26:56.570
<v Speaker 1>like if you're six foot and know how</v>
<v Speaker 1>long like the,</v>

1839
01:26:56.780 --> 01:26:59.390
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you enter your height and the whatever</v>

1840
01:26:59.391 --> 01:26:59.780
<v Speaker 1>it's called.</v>

1841
01:26:59.780 --> 01:27:01.700
<v Speaker 1>The little interesting cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amateur,</v>

1842
01:27:02.150 --> 01:27:03.720
<v Speaker 1>I think of the right word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>

1843
01:27:03.790 --> 01:27:07.490
<v Speaker 1>So it's not necessarily tracking you</v>
<v Speaker 1>through GPS.</v>

1844
01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:08.800
<v Speaker 1>This one might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1845
01:27:08.830 --> 01:27:12.380
<v Speaker 1>This one is right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that the premise on this one?</v>

1846
01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:13.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you know how they do it in the</v>

1847
01:27:13.701 --> 01:27:16.070
<v Speaker 1>UFC where they're tracking how much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many feet they're running around the</v>

1848
01:27:16.071 --> 01:27:17.420
<v Speaker 1>October?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>

1849
01:27:17.660 --> 01:27:21.200
<v Speaker 1>They don't have a gps shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They probably following them with like a</v>

1850
01:27:21.220 --> 01:27:22.790
<v Speaker 1>tracer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a dude.</v>

1851
01:27:22.791 --> 01:27:26.090
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's his job to follow each person with</v>

1852
01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:27.050
<v Speaker 1>A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1853
01:27:27.051 --> 01:27:28.400
<v Speaker 1>I would do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know what man,</v>

1854
01:27:28.401 --> 01:27:30.620
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that statistic is interesting.</v>

1855
01:27:30.860 --> 01:27:31.693
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1856
01:27:31.730 --> 01:27:34.980
<v Speaker 1>I support the chasing of the data and</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to figure out how much someone will</v>

1857
01:27:34.981 --> 01:27:36.740
<v Speaker 1>be lose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's not that important.</v>

1858
01:27:37.570 --> 01:27:38.960
<v Speaker 1>It's not that important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1859
01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:43.370
<v Speaker 1>it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's getting super specific because it</v>

1860
01:27:43.371 --> 01:27:44.900
<v Speaker 1>doesn't necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1861
01:27:45.170 --> 01:27:47.030
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a statistic.</v>

1862
01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:48.890
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just didn't dwell on it.</v>

1863
01:27:49.940 --> 01:27:52.260
<v Speaker 1>So these dudes that are playing soccer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they met the,</v>

1864
01:27:52.580 --> 01:27:56.600
<v Speaker 1>the monitor all that too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how much each team runs and all</v>

1865
01:27:56.601 --> 01:27:58.010
<v Speaker 1>that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just in football,</v>

1866
01:27:58.011 --> 01:28:00.140
<v Speaker 1>they just recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last couple of years stop hitting</v>

1867
01:28:00.141 --> 01:28:02.540
<v Speaker 1>and practice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not more because I found out about</v>

1868
01:28:02.541 --> 01:28:05.250
<v Speaker 1>concussions and whatnot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also added technology and like</v>

1869
01:28:05.540 --> 01:28:07.430
<v Speaker 1>when I was at cowboys training camp last</v>
<v Speaker 1>week,</v>

1870
01:28:07.780 --> 01:28:11.330
<v Speaker 1>there was a guy telling me they brought</v>
<v Speaker 1>an eight k cameras for when Tony Romo</v>

1871
01:28:11.331 --> 01:28:14.870
<v Speaker 1>was hurt so he could sit in a truck in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the back of practice and watch real time</v>

1872
01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:17.900
<v Speaker 1>football practice with a headset on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like vr stuff.</v>

1873
01:28:18.050 --> 01:28:18.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

1874
01:28:19.020 --> 01:28:24.020
<v Speaker 1>And so he could see the real</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't give advice on what was going on.</v>

1875
01:28:24.801 --> 01:28:27.980
<v Speaker 1>He was heard for the last eight weeks or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the year and that,</v>

1876
01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:30.590
<v Speaker 1>they don't have it all the time because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really expensive to run right now</v>

1877
01:28:30.591 --> 01:28:30.950
<v Speaker 1>still.</v>

1878
01:28:30.950 --> 01:28:34.420
<v Speaker 1>But they still had three d,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three 60 cameras running around</v>

1879
01:28:34.430 --> 01:28:38.270
<v Speaker 1>following the players.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A crazy stuff.</v>

1880
01:28:38.271 --> 01:28:40.990
<v Speaker 1>Just shout out to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dude from the Dallas cowboys.</v>

1881
01:28:40.991 --> 01:28:41.824
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's his name,</v>

1882
01:28:42.110 --> 01:28:44.740
<v Speaker 1>Charles that drives the Charles?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He hooked it up.</v>

1883
01:28:44.980 --> 01:28:46.910
<v Speaker 1>He gave me a car to give Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1884
01:28:46.911 --> 01:28:49.280
<v Speaker 1>I know Jamie's a football fan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's make it happen.</v>

1885

<v Speaker 1>trying different things out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three 60 video.</v>

1887
01:28:55.851 --> 01:28:59.090
<v Speaker 1>There's new technology will be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be virtual reality</v>

1888
01:28:59.270 --> 01:29:03.810
<v Speaker 1>where you're going to be able to like be</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nick Diaz as he fights against conor</v>

1889
01:29:03.811 --> 01:29:04.730
<v Speaker 1>mcgregor.</v>

01:29:04.770 --> 01:29:06.960
<v Speaker 1>Be able to look through each fighters</v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes.</v>

1891
01:29:07.380 --> 01:29:08.790
<v Speaker 1>They're going to figure out a way to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1892
01:29:09.850 --> 01:29:12.980
<v Speaker 1>Imagine just a little chip is needed.</v>

1895
01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:17.830
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

1896
01:29:17.830 --> 01:29:20.310
<v Speaker 1>but I'm pretty happy with the 18.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

1897
01:29:20.330 --> 01:29:24.660
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't take as much battery life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got 363 d capability.</v>

1898
01:29:24.661 --> 01:29:26.820
<v Speaker 1>It's just low resolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>

1899
01:29:26.821 --> 01:29:28.440
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

<v Speaker 1>game on ps and I know it sounds like I'm</v>

1901
01:29:33.901 --> 01:29:34.681
<v Speaker 1>plugging,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it.</v>

1902
01:29:34.681 --> 01:29:35.514
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was cool.</v>

1903
01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:38.260
<v Speaker 1>We would yelling me and my me and my</v>
<v Speaker 1>friend was like,</v>

1904
01:29:38.310 --> 01:29:40.860
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it was that intense because it was,</v>

1905
01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:42.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's parts where you almost want to</v>

1906
01:29:42.421 --> 01:29:44.850
<v Speaker 1>knock the guy out and then it's a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Very good game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have Fun.</v>

1908
01:29:47.011 --> 01:29:49.480
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can attest to it because uh,</v>

1909
01:29:49.570 --> 01:29:51.930
<v Speaker 1>I had to do the commentary for that</v>
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>

1910
01:29:51.931 --> 01:29:52.764
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the,</v>

1911
01:29:52.770 --> 01:29:56.100
<v Speaker 1>when you hear that EA sports game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not commentary from actual fights</v>

1912
01:29:56.490 --> 01:29:59.220
<v Speaker 1>as commentary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just me doing pretend and Goldberg don't</v>

1913
01:29:59.221 --> 01:30:04.030
<v Speaker 1>pretend and do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we did a fuck load of ours.</v>

1914
01:30:04.050 --> 01:30:07.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was hours and hours and hours</v>

1915
01:30:07.590 --> 01:30:10.050
<v Speaker 1>and hours and it was over a long and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>not complaining,</v>

1916
01:30:10.051 --> 01:30:13.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying you had to say so much</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

1917
01:30:13.260 --> 01:30:15.360
<v Speaker 1>And there's a man that scan meaning</v>

1918
01:30:17.830 --> 01:30:19.390
<v Speaker 1>well on a game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1919
01:30:19.391 --> 01:30:20.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to,</v>

1920
01:30:20.431 --> 01:30:22.020
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a secret.</v>

1921
01:30:22.670 --> 01:30:24.960
<v Speaker 1>I got to have a code,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the Konami Code.</v>

1922
01:30:24.990 --> 01:30:28.080
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did this so I can get out of doing</v>

1923
01:30:28.081 --> 01:30:32.400
<v Speaker 1>more commentary because there was so</v>
<v Speaker 1>much to do.</v>

1924
01:30:32.401 --> 01:30:35.130
<v Speaker 1>Tamra wish I looked that good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was so much to do.</v>

1925
01:30:35.440 --> 01:30:36.570
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as though it was,</v>

1926
01:30:36.900 --> 01:30:41.860
<v Speaker 1>it was a constant grind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I put my app,</v>

1927
01:30:41.940 --> 01:30:44.040
<v Speaker 1>my full effort into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>

1928
01:30:44.041 --> 01:30:45.480
<v Speaker 1>I really wanted it to be good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1929
01:30:45.540 --> 01:30:48.420
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking if I was a kid and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>playing this game,</v>

1930
01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:51.150
<v Speaker 1>I would want it to sound like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a guy really got head.</v>

1931
01:30:51.470 --> 01:30:55.350
<v Speaker 1>It's isn't as like we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here it is,</v>

1932
01:30:55.351 --> 01:30:56.070
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

1933
01:30:56.070 --> 01:30:58.890
<v Speaker 1>it was a fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is like I want to see me get beat the</v>

1934
01:30:58.891 --> 01:31:00.570
<v Speaker 1>fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just Jamie.</v>

1935

<v Speaker 1>Jamie shown a video of me about to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>my ass kicked by Nick Diaz are you get</v>

1936
01:31:06.050 --> 01:31:08.640
<v Speaker 1>destroyed really fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine if the game is</v>

1937
01:31:08.641 --> 01:31:10.110
<v Speaker 1>realistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pull it up.</v>

1939
01:31:13.970 --> 01:31:15.970

<v Speaker 7>character.</v>

1940
01:31:15.971 --> 01:31:18.400
<v Speaker 7>They might have.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You got some bullshit skills.</v>

1990
01:33:35.340 --> 01:33:37.440
<v Speaker 1>I want to see that more than I want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>see anything in life.</v>

1991
01:33:37.560 --> 01:33:38.161
<v Speaker 1>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>

1992
01:33:38.161 --> 01:33:42.720
<v Speaker 1>so I want to say I want to see the</v>

01:33:42.721 --> 01:33:46.860
<v Speaker 1>to the Keck observatory in Hawaii and</v>
<v Speaker 1>revisit the Milky Way more than I want</v>

1994
01:33:46.861 --> 01:33:51.120
<v Speaker 1>to see any of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to see Nick Diaz versus.</v>

1995
01:33:53.200 --> 01:33:54.540
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nick Diaz.</v>

1996
01:33:54.600 --> 01:33:58.170
<v Speaker 1>Conor mcgregor had a cool his little</v>
<v Speaker 1>walk around or wearing as he got it.</v>

1997
01:33:58.230 --> 01:33:59.700
<v Speaker 1>It was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was awesome.</v>

1998
01:33:59.701 --> 01:34:01.860
<v Speaker 1>He's a bad motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did would,</v>

1999
01:34:01.861 --> 01:34:04.560
<v Speaker 1>the way he walked around it would have</v>
<v Speaker 1>gotten the ring.</v>

2000
01:34:04.561 --> 01:34:07.020
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think he was going to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>punched in the face as much as he did</v>

2001
01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:09.210
<v Speaker 1>and we still won.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that was a cocky inches.</v>

2002
01:34:09.211 --> 01:34:09.571
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2003
01:34:09.571 --> 01:34:11.730
<v Speaker 1>he bought the first round,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knock out this mother fucker.</v>

2004
01:34:11.731 --> 01:34:13.530
<v Speaker 1>The way he just came in here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2005
01:34:13.531 --> 01:34:15.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he's trying to do is just like</v>

2006
01:34:15.480 --> 01:34:17.430
<v Speaker 1>shake it off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put an air out there.</v>

2007
01:34:17.431 --> 01:34:19.560
<v Speaker 1>But at the end of the day he's fighting</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nate Diaz.</v>

2008
01:34:19.561 --> 01:34:21.270
<v Speaker 1>He's no one's getting a first round</v>
<v Speaker 1>knockout,</v>

2009
01:34:21.720 --> 01:34:23.370
<v Speaker 1>crazy war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knew it.</v>

2010
01:34:24.050 --> 01:34:28.200
<v Speaker 1>He had to be conservative in that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Energy was so crazy.</v>

2011
01:34:28.600 --> 01:34:29.760
<v Speaker 1>It was insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>

2012
01:34:29.761 --> 01:34:30.594
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>

2013
01:34:30.810 --> 01:34:32.940
<v Speaker 1>I was so nothing ever right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>

2014
01:34:32.941 --> 01:34:34.770
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so glad I went to see a lot.</v>

2015
01:34:35.220 --> 01:34:36.390
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So He.</v>

2016
01:34:36.480 --> 01:34:37.350
<v Speaker 1>Me Too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2017
01:34:37.351 --> 01:34:37.800
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2018
01:34:37.800 --> 01:34:38.750
<v Speaker 1>as I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>

2019
01:34:38.751 --> 01:34:43.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm a casual fan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a couple of times where a</v>

2020
01:34:43.620 --> 01:34:48.620
<v Speaker 1>kinda knocked him to the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kinda doesn't want to do ground game</v>

2021
01:34:49.051 --> 01:34:50.770
<v Speaker 1>with him because he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

2022
01:34:51.970 --> 01:34:52.680
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

2023
01:34:52.680 --> 01:34:54.060
<v Speaker 1>he would tell them to come up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2024
01:34:54.110 --> 01:34:57.500
<v Speaker 1>I would think normally for my lack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not much</v>

2025
01:34:58.130 --> 01:34:59.900
<v Speaker 5>knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would think once you knock somebody to</v>

2026
01:34:59.901 --> 01:35:03.410
<v Speaker 5>the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you try to go in with those hammerfest</v>

2027
01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:04.640
<v Speaker 3>you could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could.</v>

2028
01:35:04.690 --> 01:35:07.390
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you do that with a guy like nate</v>

2029
01:35:07.391 --> 01:35:09.160
<v Speaker 3>Diaz,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he might not be hurt at all,</v>

2030
01:35:09.430 --> 01:35:11.320
<v Speaker 3>especially when you consider the fact</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2031
01:35:11.321 --> 01:35:14.240
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he connor through a bunch of really</v>

2032
01:35:14.260 --> 01:35:18.690
<v Speaker 3>powerful left leg kicks and he had</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked up nate's right leg because,</v>

2033
01:35:18.691 --> 01:35:23.470
<v Speaker 3>because of the fact that both southpaw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happens is that back leg becomes</v>

2034
01:35:23.471 --> 01:35:25.210
<v Speaker 3>the front leg.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the right leg is in front,</v>

2035
01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:26.920
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's just getting chewed up.</v>

2036
01:35:26.921 --> 01:35:29.230
<v Speaker 3>But this left power lead character right</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the beginning,</v>

2037
01:35:29.231 --> 01:35:31.690
<v Speaker 3>like over and over and over and over</v>
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

2038
01:35:32.380 --> 01:35:35.980
<v Speaker 3>When you get hit with a bunch of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like really powerful leg kicks like</v>

2039
01:35:35.981 --> 01:35:37.990
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it makes it super difficult for you to</v>

2040
01:35:37.991 --> 01:35:38.840
<v Speaker 3>move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2041
01:35:39.150 --> 01:35:41.790
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then conor just fought a smooth,</v>

2042
01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:44.140
<v Speaker 3>smart game plan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2043
01:35:44.141 --> 01:35:47.380
<v Speaker 3>he um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he engaged from the outside where he,</v>

2044
01:35:47.381 --> 01:35:52.381
<v Speaker 3>his speed was an advantage and did some</v>
<v Speaker 3>damage but didn't unload himself like he</v>

2045
01:35:53.651 --> 01:35:55.270
<v Speaker 3>did in the first fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the first fight.</v>

2046
01:35:55.270 --> 01:35:58.510
<v Speaker 3>He did that too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if any unloaded himself a nate</v>

2047
01:35:58.511 --> 01:36:01.270
<v Speaker 3>survived and when he survived,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Connor's gas tank was empty.</v>

2048
01:36:01.380 --> 01:36:03.550
<v Speaker 3>So this time connor was way more</v>
<v Speaker 3>conservative.</v>

2049
01:36:03.580 --> 01:36:05.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll see you running away a little.</v>

2050
01:36:06.020 --> 01:36:07.670
<v Speaker 3>But he'll run and get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2051
01:36:07.740 --> 01:36:08.570
<v Speaker 3>you could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could say it.</v>

2052
01:36:08.570 --> 01:36:10.330
<v Speaker 3>He got away from him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He ran away.</v>

2053
01:36:10.360 --> 01:36:14.070
<v Speaker 3>But when he was on a cake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to get close to the kt over it and</v>

2054
01:36:14.080 --> 01:36:16.060
<v Speaker 3>make it more into the sense of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2055
01:36:16.061 --> 01:36:17.000
<v Speaker 3>It's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't.</v>

2056
01:36:17.001 --> 01:36:19.350
<v Speaker 3>People are mad that he ran away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who wound your mood?</v>

2057
01:36:19.960 --> 01:36:23.770
<v Speaker 3>Because sometimes you take a break.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes you take a break.</v>

2058
01:36:23.800 --> 01:36:26.340
<v Speaker 3>He knows the three moments in the round.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got he,</v>

2059
01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:27.790
<v Speaker 3>he knows there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2060
01:36:27.820 --> 01:36:29.320
<v Speaker 3>I don't know when it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was,</v>

2061
01:36:29.350 --> 01:36:32.380
<v Speaker 3>there was a couple moments in time where</v>
<v Speaker 3>he totally turned away from him.</v>

2062
01:36:32.980 --> 01:36:34.660
<v Speaker 3>But then he engaged.</v>

2063
01:36:35.060 --> 01:36:35.631
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he did.</v>

2064
01:36:35.631 --> 01:36:37.610
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't like he was running the whole.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was just,</v>

2065
01:36:37.970 --> 01:36:41.090
<v Speaker 5>when he found himself in a compromising</v>
<v Speaker 5>position,</v>

2066
01:36:41.710 --> 01:36:43.900
<v Speaker 3>he would get out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting.</v>

2067
01:36:44.020 --> 01:36:46.960
<v Speaker 3>It's an interesting thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You guys try to kick your ass.</v>

2068
01:36:47.140 --> 01:36:51.430
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go over here for a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something funny about it.</v>

2069
01:36:51.480 --> 01:36:53.230
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seemed like a good mood.</v>

2070
01:36:53.320 --> 01:36:55.300
<v Speaker 3>It's the right move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you're.</v>

2071
01:36:55.340 --> 01:36:57.280
<v Speaker 3>When you don't feel like you can fight</v>
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>

2072
01:36:57.490 --> 01:37:02.490
<v Speaker 3>What do you want to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stand in their to get on the boys got</v>

2073
01:37:02.870 --> 01:37:05.100
<v Speaker 3>mom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get in there.</v>

2074
01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:09.730
<v Speaker 3>If you don't feel like you can breathe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe you should move away and breathe.</v>

2075
01:37:10.270 --> 01:37:13.030
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise some dude could punch you in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the body and you can go down.</v>

2076
01:37:13.060 --> 01:37:15.970
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's not a smart move to stand</v>
<v Speaker 3>in there.</v>

2077
01:37:15.971 --> 01:37:16.990
<v Speaker 3>If you feel tired,</v>

2078
01:37:17.920 --> 01:37:22.920
<v Speaker 5>how many fights do you think happened</v>
<v Speaker 5>amongst the audience members?</v>

2079
01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:25.330
<v Speaker 5>Because that's way less than you would</v>
<v Speaker 5>think.</v>

2080
01:37:25.630 --> 01:37:29.130
<v Speaker 5>I saw this girl,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she was fighting her boyfriend or</v>

2081
01:37:29.140 --> 01:37:31.780
<v Speaker 5>something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't even know if it's a boyfriend,</v>

2082
01:37:31.781 --> 01:37:33.940
<v Speaker 5>but she was choking him and she was</v>
<v Speaker 5>going crazy.</v>

2083
01:37:33.941 --> 01:37:37.750
<v Speaker 5>He and she had walked away and she came</v>
<v Speaker 5>back to him and then,</v>

2084
01:37:37.751 --> 01:37:41.710
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she was blind and sorta look lightly</v>

2085
01:37:41.711 --> 01:37:43.810
<v Speaker 5>like Ronda Rousey.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I posted it on snapchat.</v>

2086
01:37:43.811 --> 01:37:47.980

<v Speaker 5>and then,</v>

2088
01:37:51.101 --> 01:37:53.920
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then some immigrate twitter posts.</v>

2089
01:37:53.950 --> 01:37:58.950
<v Speaker 5>Apparently Ronda Rousey Ronda rousey</v>
<v Speaker 5>wouldn't be running</v>

2090
01:37:59.710 --> 01:38:03.010
<v Speaker 1>crazy and it was a video of you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>really see the face,</v>

<v Speaker 1>woman that is so stupid.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Rousey.</v>

2093
01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:13.010
<v Speaker 1>Apparently he's the only one that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody else to.</v>

2094
01:38:13.270 --> 01:38:16.120
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was so stupid.</v>

2095
01:38:16.620 --> 01:38:20.980
<v Speaker 1>It was good time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like one of the women that you</v>

2096
01:38:20.981 --> 01:38:23.080
<v Speaker 1>would ever want to fight like at a gas</v>
<v Speaker 1>station.</v>

2097
01:38:23.630 --> 01:38:25.870
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Rhonda Rousey.</v>

2098
01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:28.990
<v Speaker 1>She throw you in your fucking head on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the concrete.</v>

2099
01:38:29.990 --> 01:38:31.500
<v Speaker 1>That's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's terrifying.</v>

2100
01:38:31.510 --> 01:38:34.390
<v Speaker 1>Have women like that out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could just beat your ass.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

2102
01:38:34.870 --> 01:38:36.130
<v Speaker 5>It's terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it.</v>

2103
01:38:37.130 --> 01:38:41.630
<v Speaker 5>Whenever I'm at the UFC and somebody</v>
<v Speaker 5>gets kicked in the face,</v>

2104
01:38:42.610 --> 01:38:45.660
<v Speaker 5>I just always,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just think about how disappointed I'd</v>

2105
01:38:45.661 --> 01:38:49.010
<v Speaker 5>be if I got kicked in the face of what</v>
<v Speaker 5>did I do in my life?</v>

2106
01:38:49.011 --> 01:38:51.710
<v Speaker 5>Was somebody kicking me in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even especially.</v>

2107
01:38:51.711 --> 01:38:54.200
<v Speaker 5>I mean you've never been kicked in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>face.</v>

2108
01:38:54.450 --> 01:38:59.450
<v Speaker 5>It's just been kicked in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Especially like that's why I'm glad I</v>

2109
01:39:00.351 --> 01:39:02.120
<v Speaker 5>didn't fight that guy and I'm glad I</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't.</v>

2110
01:39:02.150 --> 01:39:05.210
<v Speaker 5>I don't put myself in situations where I</v>
<v Speaker 5>got to fight a strategy because you</v>

2111
01:39:05.211 --> 01:39:07.410
<v Speaker 5>never know where.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just.</v>

2112

<v Speaker 5>if I was to be fighting,</v>

2113
01:39:09.351 --> 01:39:14.351

<v Speaker 5>but if somebody just kicked me in the</v>

<v Speaker 5>it's a different type of emotion.</v>

2131
01:40:07.630 --> 01:40:10.810
<v Speaker 5>When he went serone started fucking that</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude up.</v>

2132
01:40:10.811 --> 01:40:11.644

2133
01:40:13.950 --> 01:40:15.710
<v Speaker 1>You were in there with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in there.</v>

2134
01:40:16.150 --> 01:40:18.780
<v Speaker 1>Isn't there with fucking couple thousand</v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars?</v>

2135
01:40:18.781 --> 01:40:19.800
<v Speaker 1>Hell yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was with them.</v>

2136
01:40:20.430 --> 01:40:24.240
<v Speaker 1>I was in fucking appreciate your</v>
<v Speaker 1>loyalty.</v>

2137
01:40:24.300 --> 01:40:26.280
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's both on it.</v>

2138
01:40:26.390 --> 01:40:28.590
<v Speaker 1>And Donald Cerrone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dope.</v>

2139
01:40:29.280 --> 01:40:31.780
<v Speaker 1>And then a Johnson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2140
01:40:31.830 --> 01:40:34.920
<v Speaker 1>I bet on Johnson right before the fight</v>
<v Speaker 1>started,</v>

2141
01:40:35.010 --> 01:40:36.960
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what were the aunt?</v>

2142
01:40:37.470 --> 01:40:41.310
<v Speaker 1>He was minus 2:50.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's pretty reasonable considering</v>

2143
01:40:41.311 --> 01:40:44.800
<v Speaker 1>how hard he hit and he wanted so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I got on it.</v>

2144
01:40:45.060 --> 01:40:47.670
<v Speaker 1>We think it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody told me I have to research it.</v>

2145
01:40:48.030 --> 01:40:50.850
<v Speaker 1>Please do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was that the fastest knockout in the</v>

2146
01:40:50.851 --> 01:40:52.890
<v Speaker 1>history of the light heavyweight</v>
<v Speaker 1>division?</v>

2147
01:40:52.970 --> 01:40:53.803
<v Speaker 1>I think it was close,</v>

2148
01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:56.850
<v Speaker 3>it was 13 seconds or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll all go to place.</v>

2149
01:40:56.880 --> 01:40:59.440
<v Speaker 3>My Bet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He hit so hard.</v>

2150
01:40:59.470 --> 01:41:02.680
<v Speaker 3>That happened so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like he hit so hard.</v>

2151
01:41:02.950 --> 01:41:06.340
<v Speaker 3>It happens so quick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When glover started pressuring him,</v>

2152
01:41:06.470 --> 01:41:09.240
<v Speaker 3>like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I score a fight or rather a</v>

2153
01:41:09.280 --> 01:41:11.470
<v Speaker 3>commentator fight when I watched</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

2154
01:41:11.471 --> 01:41:12.310
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2155
01:41:12.311 --> 01:41:15.190
<v Speaker 3>what can glow overdue and what can</v>
<v Speaker 3>rumble too.</v>

2156
01:41:15.220 --> 01:41:17.530
<v Speaker 3>We know rumble has awesome stand up</v>
<v Speaker 3>skills.</v>

2157
01:41:17.531 --> 01:41:19.510
<v Speaker 3>We know we had a college wrestling</v>
<v Speaker 3>background.</v>

2158
01:41:19.511 --> 01:41:22.870
<v Speaker 3>We know he's a really powerful and he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably the hardest hitter ever.</v>

2159
01:41:23.020 --> 01:41:26.020
<v Speaker 3>So what can we do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's really technical.</v>

2160
01:41:26.110 --> 01:41:30.070
<v Speaker 3>He can survive a storm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe he could take him down,</v>

2161
01:41:30.100 --> 01:41:33.520
<v Speaker 3>maybe get them into deep water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we start town super aggressive.</v>

2162
01:41:33.521 --> 01:41:38.521
<v Speaker 3>Bob and we even Tyson style and the one</v>
<v Speaker 3>haymaker one haymaker upper cut.</v>

<v Speaker 3>like fucking craps.</v>

2173
01:42:09.610 --> 01:42:13.390

<v Speaker 3>on summer rumbles fights.</v>

2174
01:42:13.770 --> 01:42:18.310

2176
01:42:22.420 --> 01:42:26.230
<v Speaker 3>It's like he knows something that nobody</v>
<v Speaker 3>knows about.</v>

2177
01:42:26.231 --> 01:42:27.850
<v Speaker 3>How to hit people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This dude.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Was it 25?</v>

2182
01:42:36.240 --> 01:42:39.100
<v Speaker 3>He was an elite fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2183
01:42:39.130 --> 01:42:43.030
<v Speaker 3>glover is beyond elite glover's font for</v>
<v Speaker 3>the title.</v>

2184
01:42:43.390 --> 01:42:46.450
<v Speaker 3>He had a five round fight with Jon</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jones.</v>

2185
01:42:46.451 --> 01:42:47.870
<v Speaker 3>Went to the distance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2186
01:42:47.980 --> 01:42:51.220
<v Speaker 3>So one of the best fighters in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

2187
01:42:51.300 --> 01:42:52.450
<v Speaker 3>Glover's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Excellent.</v>

2188
01:42:52.470 --> 01:42:56.320
<v Speaker 3>And that's crazy that he got gotten 13</v>
<v Speaker 3>seconds.</v>

2189
01:42:56.350 --> 01:42:57.430
<v Speaker 3>You don't what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2190
01:42:57.460 --> 01:43:00.770
<v Speaker 3>There's the human frame.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2191
01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.130
<v Speaker 3>like the skull,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the brain,</v>

2192
01:43:03.131 --> 01:43:08.131
<v Speaker 3>the neck can only take so much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just can only take so much.</v>

2193
01:43:08.510 --> 01:43:11.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And most people can't hit that bell.</v>

2194
01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:15.250
<v Speaker 3>You know that bell when you go to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>carnival and he slammed down on that</v>

2195
01:43:15.251 --> 01:43:17.440
<v Speaker 3>bell and the little thing goes up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

2196
01:43:19.180 --> 01:43:22.780
<v Speaker 3>most people can't make that thing Dang</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this world.</v>

2197
01:43:23.350 --> 01:43:27.760
<v Speaker 3>But Rumble Johnson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he can make that thing ding every time</v>

2198
01:43:28.060 --> 01:43:31.570
<v Speaker 3>with his open barrage you with is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>first,</v>

2199
01:43:31.730 --> 01:43:34.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>name the number 200 punches and kicks,</v>

2200
01:43:34.661 --> 01:43:36.970
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He can knock you the fuck out.</v>

2201
01:43:37.300 --> 01:43:42.300
<v Speaker 3>The question with a guy like that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it gets past that 200 number and the</v>

2202
01:43:42.401 --> 01:43:45.200
<v Speaker 3>opponent is still there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can you make it through it?</v>

2203
01:43:45.550 --> 01:43:47.140
<v Speaker 3>And that's what happened in the cormier</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>

2204
01:43:47.410 --> 01:43:50.920
<v Speaker 3>It's like rumble hit with everything but</v>
<v Speaker 3>the kitchen sink.</v>

2205
01:43:51.440 --> 01:43:56.440
<v Speaker 3>But cormier is so fucking tough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's so tough from being a world class</v>

2206
01:43:58.011 --> 01:44:01.040
<v Speaker 3>Olympic wrestler from a guy who competed</v>
<v Speaker 3>all over the world.</v>

2207
01:44:01.310 --> 01:44:05.210
<v Speaker 3>He's just got this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is like a level of toughness that</v>

2208
01:44:05.211 --> 01:44:08.780
<v Speaker 3>you can't recreate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he takes a big bomb but figures out</v>

2209
01:44:08.781 --> 01:44:13.300
<v Speaker 3>how to scramble and survive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so he makes it into law.</v>

2210
01:44:13.470 --> 01:44:15.590
<v Speaker 3>What rounded cormay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Submit rumble.</v>

2211
01:44:19.140 --> 01:44:20.910
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing about a guy like rumble though</v>

2212
01:44:20.911 --> 01:44:25.710
<v Speaker 3>is you could submit them once,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but once he figures out what you did and</v>

2213
01:44:25.711 --> 01:44:29.130
<v Speaker 3>he remembers how much it sucked when you</v>
<v Speaker 3>did that to him.</v>

2214
01:44:29.490 --> 01:44:32.550
<v Speaker 3>Can you do it again and if you can't do</v>
<v Speaker 3>it again,</v>

2215
01:44:33.300 --> 01:44:35.820
<v Speaker 3>what if he can figure out how to keep it</v>
<v Speaker 3>standing?</v>

2216
01:44:36.420 --> 01:44:38.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What if he could figure out how to keep</v>

2217
01:44:38.370 --> 01:44:43.370
<v Speaker 3>hitting you with those barrages of heavy</v>
<v Speaker 3>bones coming flying at you with perfect</v>

2218
01:44:44.611 --> 01:44:48.360
<v Speaker 3>technique.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He is so fucking hard,</v>

2219
01:44:48.361 --> 01:44:51.390
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What third round?</v>

2220
01:44:52.450 --> 01:44:54.540
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cormay took them into deep water,</v>

2221
01:44:54.541 --> 01:44:57.720
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is comedy is such a bad</v>

2222
01:44:57.721 --> 01:44:58.554
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker</v>

2223
01:44:58.960 --> 01:45:01.740
<v Speaker 1>at?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where does that come from?</v>

2224
01:45:01.980 --> 01:45:05.400
<v Speaker 1>We know that some people just naturally</v>
<v Speaker 1>fast.</v>

2225
01:45:05.401 --> 01:45:09.690
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that just a uses naturally able to</v>

2226
01:45:10.110 --> 01:45:13.640
<v Speaker 1>hit hardest fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or do you punch walls?</v>

2227
01:45:13.650 --> 01:45:16.860
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you can close it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get better,</v>

2228
01:45:16.861 --> 01:45:20.050
<v Speaker 1>but it is also a natural sort of this</v>

2229
01:45:21.090 --> 01:45:24.390
<v Speaker 3>the reality of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A totally objectively,</v>

2230
01:45:25.110 --> 01:45:28.260
<v Speaker 3>everybody has a ceiling and you can't</v>
<v Speaker 3>pass that ceiling.</v>

2231
01:45:28.810 --> 01:45:33.030
<v Speaker 3>You see certain people that have certain</v>
<v Speaker 3>frames like maybe they have really</v>

2232
01:45:33.031 --> 01:45:37.200
<v Speaker 3>narrow shoulders and really small hands</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it really small waist.</v>

2233
01:45:37.650 --> 01:45:41.820
<v Speaker 3>They can't generate the same kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>power that a guy like rumble Johnson,</v>

2234
01:45:41.821 --> 01:45:44.550
<v Speaker 3>Ken,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or there's a lot of other guys like guy</v>

2235
01:45:44.560 --> 01:45:45.990
<v Speaker 3>like rampage Jackson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ken,</v>

2236
01:45:46.200 --> 01:45:48.370
<v Speaker 3>for a guy like George St Pierre can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's.</v>

2237
01:45:48.371 --> 01:45:50.940
<v Speaker 3>There's certain like physiques,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ilir,</v>

2238
01:45:50.941 --> 01:45:52.830
<v Speaker 3>Latifa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You ever see that guy fight?</v>

2239
01:45:53.040 --> 01:45:54.840
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pull this motherfucker up.</v>

2240
01:45:54.990 --> 01:45:58.620
<v Speaker 3>I think he's fighting Ryan Bader.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say motherfucker with all due respect</v>

2241
01:45:58.621 --> 01:46:02.970
<v Speaker 3>sir.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just tank of a wrestler and you</v>

2242
01:46:02.971 --> 01:46:05.550
<v Speaker 3>look at that guys frame and he just</v>
<v Speaker 3>bombs on dudes.</v>

2243
01:46:05.551 --> 01:46:07.980
<v Speaker 3>Knocks him unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you look at his frame and he's</v>

2244
01:46:07.981 --> 01:46:08.820
<v Speaker 3>throwing punches.</v>

2245
01:46:09.330 --> 01:46:09.991
<v Speaker 1>Let's go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2246
01:46:09.991 --> 01:46:13.200
<v Speaker 1>That's like this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's levels of athletes,</v>

2247
01:46:13.230 --> 01:46:15.150
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's levels of wrestlers.</v>

2248
01:46:15.160 --> 01:46:18.840
<v Speaker 1>His levels of strikers and when you see</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain dudes,</v>

2249
01:46:18.841 --> 01:46:22.140
<v Speaker 1>the way they can move their body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you ever watched Cirque du Solei?</v>

2250
01:46:22.230 --> 01:46:23.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even seeing it live,</v>

2251
01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:27.510
<v Speaker 1>seeing it left 70 degrees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is amazing.</v>

2252
01:46:27.630 --> 01:46:29.460
<v Speaker 1>You feel like how the fuck do they do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that with their body?</v>

2253
01:46:29.820 --> 01:46:32.640
<v Speaker 1>You immediately start feeling inadequate</v>
<v Speaker 1>with your body.</v>

2254
01:46:32.990 --> 01:46:37.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's why I feel I just can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just get inspired by the choreography</v>

2255
01:46:38.251 --> 01:46:39.900
<v Speaker 1>and I said I need to step my show up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2256
01:46:39.901 --> 01:46:42.020
<v Speaker 1>that's a beautiful one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to target.</v>

2257
01:46:42.090 --> 01:46:46.020
<v Speaker 1>I think I want to figure out how to do a</v>
<v Speaker 1>handstand with one hand check above</v>

2258
01:46:46.021 --> 01:46:48.440
<v Speaker 1>being with one hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is hank.</v>

2259
01:46:49.050 --> 01:46:49.883
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2260
01:46:50.270 --> 01:46:52.730
<v Speaker 3>So he's the light heavyweight and</v>
<v Speaker 3>heavyweight light heavyweight two.</v>

2261
01:46:52.750 --> 01:46:53.420
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five.</v>

2262
01:46:53.420 --> 01:46:55.360
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the point being that a gentleman,</v>

2263
01:46:56.080 --> 01:46:58.150
<v Speaker 2>13 pounds less than me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

2264
01:46:58.240 --> 01:47:01.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm a light heavyweight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well me and him one on one.</v>

2265
01:47:01.210 --> 01:47:03.700
<v Speaker 3>He weighs 200,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five for about 13 minutes,</v>

2266
01:47:04.760 --> 01:47:08.830
<v Speaker 3>probably goes back up to whatever it is</v>
<v Speaker 3>before he starts this cut.</v>

2267
01:47:09.040 --> 01:47:11.200
<v Speaker 3>But my point being like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like look at the size of that</v>

2268
01:47:11.201 --> 01:47:13.360
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean Jesus Christ,</v>

2269
01:47:13.361 --> 01:47:15.400
<v Speaker 3>look at that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a tank.</v>

2270
01:47:15.850 --> 01:47:18.610
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's limitations of the human frame</v>

2271
01:47:18.700 --> 01:47:22.870
<v Speaker 3>and that guy has a different bone</v>
<v Speaker 3>structure than Doogie howser.</v>

2272
01:47:23.430 --> 01:47:25.150
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's just no denying it.</v>

2273
01:47:25.360 --> 01:47:27.610
<v Speaker 3>It's or no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a bad example.</v>

2274
01:47:27.611 --> 01:47:31.270
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of guys that are his size.</v>

2275
01:47:31.570 --> 01:47:34.000
<v Speaker 3>They just don't have the kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>advantages that he has.</v>

2276
01:47:34.060 --> 01:47:37.630
<v Speaker 3>Bone structure wise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>physically like what he can do,</v>

2277
01:47:37.690 --> 01:47:41.080
<v Speaker 3>there's like a certain amount of</v>
<v Speaker 3>horsepower at certain guys have and you</v>

2278
01:47:41.081 --> 01:47:42.520
<v Speaker 3>watch that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You look at that guy,</v>

2279
01:47:42.521 --> 01:47:44.310
<v Speaker 3>the guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a fucking tank of a man.</v>

2280
01:47:44.350 --> 01:47:47.500
<v Speaker 3>Brock Lesnar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>perfect example guys takes off.</v>

2281
01:47:47.740 --> 01:47:49.420
<v Speaker 3>How many years have you take off?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like five years.</v>

2282
01:47:49.421 --> 01:47:52.060
<v Speaker 3>At least six years at least.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He fights Mark Hunt,</v>

2283
01:47:52.300 --> 01:47:55.630
<v Speaker 3>roids or no roids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever the fuck he tested positive for</v>

2284
01:47:55.810 --> 01:47:59.290
<v Speaker 3>or anti estrogen blockers or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just forget about all that.</v>

2285
01:47:59.291 --> 01:48:04.291
<v Speaker 3>The fact that this guy was able to fight</v>
<v Speaker 3>mark fucking hunt after five or six</v>

2286
01:48:04.661 --> 01:48:07.960
<v Speaker 3>years of no fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just doing pro wrestling and then when</v>

2287
01:48:08.410 --> 01:48:09.243
<v Speaker 3>that's insane,</v>

2288
01:48:09.670 --> 01:48:11.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had had a bed in.</v>

2289
01:48:11.381 --> 01:48:15.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm Mark Hunt and you had told me and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't know that I told you I'm casual.</v>

2290
01:48:15.941 --> 01:48:20.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm a casual fan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I took Mark Hunt but I didn't know</v>

2291
01:48:20.081 --> 01:48:22.720
<v Speaker 2>anything about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then uh,</v>

2292
01:48:22.870 --> 01:48:25.420
<v Speaker 2>he walks out and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit,</v>

<v Speaker 2>he's built like me to add a cash back.</v>

2294
01:48:30.970 --> 01:48:33.820
<v Speaker 2>So I did not go on in my book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>My online book.</v>

2295
01:48:33.880 --> 01:48:37.390
<v Speaker 2>This is before the fight stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to bet on a brock lesnar real</v>

2296
01:48:37.391 --> 01:48:38.570
<v Speaker 2>quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2297
01:48:38.770 --> 01:48:41.110
<v Speaker 2>that's already taken the bad data.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was like,</v>

2298
01:48:41.140 --> 01:48:43.270
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't bet on this guy that's built</v>

2299
01:48:43.271 --> 01:48:46.240
<v Speaker 2>like me Brock Lesnar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

2300
01:48:46.480 --> 01:48:49.420
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not necessarily true.</v>

2301
01:48:49.421 --> 01:48:52.510
<v Speaker 2>I know is that necessarily true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that was my instinct at the time,</v>

2302
01:48:52.520 --> 01:48:53.530
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>

2303
01:48:53.810 --> 01:48:58.730
<v Speaker 3>what brock lesnar did in a taking down</v>
<v Speaker 3>the amount of time off and then beating</v>

2304
01:48:58.731 --> 01:49:02.090
<v Speaker 3>a guy like Mark Hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's so extraordinary and he's</v>

2305
01:49:02.091 --> 01:49:05.840
<v Speaker 3>probably never going to get the credit</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he deserves because the fact that</v>

2306
01:49:05.930 --> 01:49:08.540
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was a pro wrestler and then two,</v>

2307
01:49:08.810 --> 01:49:12.340
<v Speaker 3>he tested positive for this anti</v>
<v Speaker 3>estrogen blocker.</v>

2308
01:49:12.350 --> 01:49:14.330
<v Speaker 3>Whatever the fuck he took.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what happened.</v>

2309
01:49:14.450 --> 01:49:15.520
<v Speaker 3>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could've been.</v>

2310
01:49:15.930 --> 01:49:19.490
<v Speaker 3>He could've been easily been some</v>
<v Speaker 3>performance enhancing formula that he</v>

2311
01:49:19.491 --> 01:49:22.340
<v Speaker 3>bought from GNC or it could have been</v>
<v Speaker 3>something more insidious.</v>

2312
01:49:22.550 --> 01:49:26.000
<v Speaker 3>Whatever the fuck it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fact that this guy was able to beat</v>

2313
01:49:26.001 --> 01:49:29.510
<v Speaker 3>Mark Hunt after all those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that time off just shows you what an</v>

2314
01:49:29.511 --> 01:49:34.511
<v Speaker 3>amazing athlete he really is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no way in hell that certain guys</v>

2315
01:49:34.581 --> 01:49:38.900
<v Speaker 3>are going to catch up to that guy if</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy just keeps working out.</v>

2316
01:49:39.230 --> 01:49:44.230
<v Speaker 3>Like there's guys that like if they just</v>
<v Speaker 3>keep working out and they stay healthy</v>

2317
01:49:44.750 --> 01:49:49.600
<v Speaker 3>and they stay fit and they get into the</v>
<v Speaker 3>healthy and fit with no injuries,</v>

2318
01:49:49.810 --> 01:49:50.800
<v Speaker 3>which is like the primary.</v>

2319
01:49:50.810 --> 01:49:54.100
<v Speaker 3>That's just like you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's certain guys that you like,</v>

2320
01:49:54.101 --> 01:49:56.470
<v Speaker 3>you're in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in a world of shit.</v>

2321
01:49:57.460 --> 01:50:02.320
<v Speaker 3>If you get a guy like brock lesnar into</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ring with you and he's not her and</v>

2322
01:50:02.321 --> 01:50:05.080
<v Speaker 3>he's in great shape and he has no</v>
<v Speaker 3>injuries,</v>

2323
01:50:05.290 --> 01:50:08.800
<v Speaker 3>you're in a world of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're standing in front of a Goliath of</v>

2324
01:50:08.801 --> 01:50:12.010
<v Speaker 3>a man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A guy was a struggle to die it down.</v>

2325
01:50:12.040 --> 01:50:14.720
<v Speaker 3>Two hundred and 65 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2326
01:50:14.900 --> 01:50:17.590
<v Speaker 3>It's not fair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about cm punk?</v>

2327
01:50:17.591 --> 01:50:19.180
<v Speaker 3>Is he good?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is he making his debut?</v>

2328
01:50:19.300 --> 01:50:23.680
<v Speaker 3>He's making his UFC debut,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I have to respect that.</v>

2329
01:50:23.681 --> 01:50:27.580
<v Speaker 3>He did a lot of things the right way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He went to Duke Roufus,</v>

2330
01:50:27.581 --> 01:50:30.550
<v Speaker 3>his camp in Minneapolis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Milwaukee Rather.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You go to right now.</v>

2332

<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2334
01:50:34.691 --> 01:50:37.060

<v Speaker 3>He went to Milwaukee because that's</v>

2335
01:50:37.061 --> 01:50:39.030
<v Speaker 3>where duke is it.</v>

2336
01:50:39.070 --> 01:50:41.510
<v Speaker 3>What he did was he went to one of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>best gyms in the world,</v>

2337
01:50:41.540 --> 01:50:42.580
<v Speaker 3>the roof,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his sport.</v>

2338
01:50:42.940 --> 01:50:46.420
<v Speaker 3>He Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm his brother.</v>

2339
01:50:46.450 --> 01:50:49.330
<v Speaker 3>I'm Rick Rufus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was like a world champion kickboxer</v>

2340
01:50:49.331 --> 01:50:54.070
<v Speaker 3>that used to be on Pka karate and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's Duke Roufus do group as a world</v>

2341
01:50:54.071 --> 01:50:57.950
<v Speaker 3>champion more tie fighter and he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>produced like a ton of worldclass</v>

2342
01:50:58.090 --> 01:51:00.430
<v Speaker 3>fighters like Anthony Pettis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sergio Pettis,</v>

2343
01:51:00.880 --> 01:51:02.900
<v Speaker 3>Tyron Woodley.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does is tracking down there.</v>

2344
01:51:02.930 --> 01:51:06.910
<v Speaker 3>He's the new UFC welterweight champion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so duke roufus is just like a really</v>

2345
01:51:06.911 --> 01:51:10.720
<v Speaker 3>high level camp and that's where cm punk</v>
<v Speaker 3>chose to move his camp and he,</v>

2346
01:51:10.750 --> 01:51:14.290
<v Speaker 3>he lived there for like two years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They always been doing this training was</v>

2347
01:51:14.291 --> 01:51:17.290
<v Speaker 3>signed with the UFC and he just said I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to do this the right way.</v>

2348
01:51:17.560 --> 01:51:19.870
<v Speaker 3>And he went through a full,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>

2349
01:51:19.960 --> 01:51:24.310
<v Speaker 3>like a long period of training,</v>
<v Speaker 3>learning skills and working under the</v>

2350
01:51:24.311 --> 01:51:26.260
<v Speaker 3>tutelage of like one of the best guys in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>

2351
01:51:26.290 --> 01:51:28.350
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who the fuck knows what's going to</v>

2352
01:51:28.360 --> 01:51:29.920
<v Speaker 3>happen?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We really don't know.</v>

2353
01:51:30.280 --> 01:51:32.350
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea what this guy can do.</v>

2354
01:51:32.600 --> 01:51:36.160
<v Speaker 3>I've seen him hit some pads.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen some slow motion,</v>

2355
01:51:36.161 --> 01:51:39.490
<v Speaker 3>weird blurry videos of him sparring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2356
01:51:39.760 --> 01:51:43.360
<v Speaker 3>I mean they might be trying to shield it</v>
<v Speaker 3>for promotional purposes.</v>

2357
01:51:43.690 --> 01:51:45.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he might've gotten really good.</v>

2358
01:51:45.820 --> 01:51:46.790
<v Speaker 3>He might be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2359
01:51:46.840 --> 01:51:49.270
<v Speaker 3>if the guy's willing to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's an extraordinary amount of</v>

2360
01:51:49.271 --> 01:51:51.310
<v Speaker 3>discipline that it takes to move to a</v>
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>

2361
01:51:51.490 --> 01:51:54.070
<v Speaker 3>Change your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lived there for two years.</v>

2362
01:51:54.280 --> 01:51:56.050
<v Speaker 3>Just nothing but train.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2363
01:51:56.051 --> 01:51:58.330
<v Speaker 3>who the fuck knows?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's the big.</v>

2364
01:51:58.860 --> 01:52:02.290
<v Speaker 3>The big statement is who the fuck knows?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you go to watch him fight,</v>

2365
01:52:02.570 --> 01:52:06.250
<v Speaker 3>it's like you're tuning in for</v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially like a spectacle and it</v>

2366
01:52:06.251 --> 01:52:08.000
<v Speaker 3>might be great and it might.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we,</v>

2367
01:52:08.050 --> 01:52:08.883
<v Speaker 3>we have to see.</v>

2368
01:52:09.280 --> 01:52:12.250
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't know if he's ever fought.</v>

2369
01:52:12.450 --> 01:52:13.410
<v Speaker 3>We don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one knows.</v>

2370
01:52:13.450 --> 01:52:16.420
<v Speaker 3>No one knows what the fuck's gonna</v>
<v Speaker 3>happen fall with the people that either.</v>

2371
01:52:16.421 --> 01:52:19.780
<v Speaker 3>That's a different thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a big difference.</v>

2372
01:52:19.870 --> 01:52:23.440
<v Speaker 3>There's a big difference between</v>
<v Speaker 3>training and reality and you know,</v>

2373
01:52:23.441 --> 01:52:27.220
<v Speaker 3>and maybe he excels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's people who excel at reality</v>

2374
01:52:27.490 --> 01:52:30.010
<v Speaker 3>where they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they look lackluster and training and</v>

2375
01:52:30.011 --> 01:52:34.210
<v Speaker 3>then they rise to the occasion of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>event and then there's other people that</v>

2376
01:52:34.211 --> 01:52:36.880
<v Speaker 3>are exact opposite what a practice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2377
01:52:36.881 --> 01:52:40.690
<v Speaker 3>and then yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the anxiety of performance is real,</v>

2378
01:52:40.691 --> 01:52:42.810
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody is just.</v>

2379
01:52:42.910 --> 01:52:44.920
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it was a point</v>

2380
01:52:46.250 --> 01:52:48.260
<v Speaker 5>during the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a Ds,</v>

<v Speaker 5>in the crowded des Des des.</v>

2383
01:52:58.620 --> 01:53:00.620

<v Speaker 5>what is he thinking right now?</v>

2384
01:53:00.621 --> 01:53:02.900
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what does that feel like?</v>

2385
01:53:02.930 --> 01:53:06.020
<v Speaker 5>This dude is in the clench is a huge</v>
<v Speaker 5>fight.</v>

2386
01:53:06.250 --> 01:53:09.680
<v Speaker 5>The headliners lunch streaming down his</v>
<v Speaker 5>face.</v>

2387
01:53:10.370 --> 01:53:13.790
<v Speaker 5>What is his pants off?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What does he feel like,</v>

2388
01:53:14.360 --> 01:53:16.580
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with the crowd chanting.</v>

2391
01:53:22.100 --> 01:53:23.150

<v Speaker 5>Does it,</v>

2392
01:53:23.151 --> 01:53:27.070
<v Speaker 5>is it distracting?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Does it hype you up as they chat?</v>

2393
01:53:27.071 --> 01:53:28.670
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I don't know about how much,</v>

2409
01:54:04.700 --> 01:54:06.160
<v Speaker 3>at least a few thousand dollars because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

2410
01:54:06.230 --> 01:54:07.870
<v Speaker 3>what is it Jamie sign?</v>

2411
01:54:08.620 --> 01:54:09.410
<v Speaker 5>Because it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2412
01:54:09.410 --> 01:54:11.270
<v Speaker 5>people are chanting your name.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

2413
01:54:11.271 --> 01:54:13.280
<v Speaker 5>But it's not like basketball because you</v>
<v Speaker 5>just got,</v>

2414
01:54:13.340 --> 01:54:15.890
<v Speaker 5>you've been punched in the face a lot so</v>
<v Speaker 5>you didn't a little bit of pain.</v>

2415
01:54:16.910 --> 01:54:19.370
<v Speaker 5>You might be hurting that kinda tired,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2416
01:54:19.850 --> 01:54:20.980
<v Speaker 5>it's not just you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

2417
01:54:20.990 --> 01:54:22.910
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just drop the three are soft and then</v>

2418
01:54:22.911 --> 01:54:27.911
<v Speaker 5>you just jogging in the clinic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's like this is cool but I'm still</v>

2419
01:54:28.821 --> 01:54:29.654
<v Speaker 5>kind of uncomfort</v>

2420
01:54:30.370 --> 01:54:31.650
<v Speaker 3>maybe fires you up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many?</v>

2421
01:54:31.651 --> 01:54:34.320
<v Speaker 3>Twenty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>$20,000 for boxing and MMA.</v>

2422
01:54:34.530 --> 01:54:36.510
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's so many.</v>

2423
01:54:36.830 --> 01:54:41.830
<v Speaker 3>That's a lot of fucking people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's approximately 5,000 more than</v>

2424
01:54:42.721 --> 01:54:44.460
<v Speaker 3>the MGM.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mgm.</v>

2425
01:54:44.461 --> 01:54:47.940
<v Speaker 3>About 15,000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somewhere around there I think.</v>

2426
01:54:47.970 --> 01:54:49.890
<v Speaker 3>Is that why they moved them there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because there's more people.</v>

2427
01:54:49.891 --> 01:54:51.690
<v Speaker 3>It's just a different deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

2428
01:54:51.691 --> 01:54:54.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think they could sell this out to</v>

2429
01:54:55.200 --> 01:54:56.700
<v Speaker 3>16.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Jesus.</v>

01:54:56.701 --> 01:54:58.710
<v Speaker 3>The mgms that big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so is it Mandalay bay?</v>

2432
01:55:01.441 --> 01:55:02.790
<v Speaker 3>That's 15.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it is?</v>

2433
01:55:02.880 --> 01:55:05.130
<v Speaker 3>Or is that 14?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What am I asking?</v>

2434
01:55:05.131 --> 01:55:08.340
<v Speaker 3>What am I fucking census taker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to stop answering</v>

2435
01:55:08.610 --> 01:55:10.020
<v Speaker 3>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Booking agent.</v>

2436
01:55:10.840 --> 01:55:12.200
<v Speaker 3>What does it hold?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wealth thousand.</v>

2437
01:55:12.240 --> 01:55:13.340
<v Speaker 3>Oh shit man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lay based.</v>

2438
01:55:13.350 --> 01:55:15.180
<v Speaker 3>Only 12,000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

2439
01:55:15.360 --> 01:55:16.590
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2440
01:55:16.660 --> 01:55:18.590
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess the reason why they moved it was</v>

2441
01:55:18.600 --> 01:55:20.700
<v Speaker 3>just the UFC could sell out those places</v>
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>

2442
01:55:20.910 --> 01:55:24.000
<v Speaker 3>especially for this fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This fight was gone.</v>

2443
01:55:24.300 --> 01:55:26.880
<v Speaker 3>Damn button.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was amazing.</v>

2444
01:55:27.180 --> 01:55:27.610
<v Speaker 3>You could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2445
01:55:27.610 --> 01:55:30.300
<v Speaker 3>you could have stuck a light bulb in</v>
<v Speaker 3>your mouth and it would've started</v>

2446
01:55:30.301 --> 01:55:31.520
<v Speaker 3>glowing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2447
01:55:31.840 --> 01:55:34.800
<v Speaker 3>It was electricity in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was going through our fingertips.</v>

2448
01:55:35.010 --> 01:55:36.120
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was crazy,</v>

2449
01:55:36.121 --> 01:55:37.440
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a good time.</v>

2450
01:55:37.590 --> 01:55:39.310
<v Speaker 3>That's why I decided to keep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2451
01:55:39.390 --> 01:55:41.520
<v Speaker 3>working for the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's moments like that.</v>

2452
01:55:41.700 --> 01:55:46.080
<v Speaker 3>The Nate Diaz Mcgregor fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first one was one of the in the</v>

2453
01:55:46.080 --> 01:55:47.630
<v Speaker 3>Misha tate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holly Holm fight me.</v>

2454
01:55:47.750 --> 01:55:50.160
<v Speaker 3>She choked Holly Holm unconscious in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fifth round.</v>

2455
01:55:50.161 --> 01:55:52.680
<v Speaker 3>It was fucking chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember thinking,</v>

2456
01:55:52.681 --> 01:55:54.930
<v Speaker 3>how could I stop doing this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How could I.</v>

2457
01:55:54.930 --> 01:55:56.910
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe I even got this job in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first place.</v>

2458
01:55:57.410 --> 01:56:01.070
<v Speaker 3>I get to watch this crazy shit and talk</v>
<v Speaker 3>about it from the.</v>

2459
01:56:01.140 --> 01:56:03.210
<v Speaker 3>So you wouldn't know when they bought</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2460
01:56:03.680 --> 01:56:06.120
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just was thinking I was doing too many</v>

2461
01:56:06.121 --> 01:56:10.050
<v Speaker 3>things and then I decided bombs just</v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of just being crazy launch,</v>

2462
01:56:10.051 --> 01:56:12.900
<v Speaker 3>do less.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to do less and doing</v>

2463
01:56:12.901 --> 01:56:14.820
<v Speaker 3>less.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just made a big difference.</v>

2464
01:56:14.880 --> 01:56:19.880
<v Speaker 3>Vape pen use after you have a man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just got punched in the face of</v>

2465
01:56:21.990 --> 01:56:23.340
<v Speaker 3>folks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Relax.</v>

2466
01:56:23.890 --> 01:56:26.520
<v Speaker 3>Should be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should let him use it immediately</v>

2467
01:56:26.521 --> 01:56:29.040
<v Speaker 3>after it just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's be scientific about this.</v>

2468
01:56:29.700 --> 01:56:32.070
<v Speaker 3>We all want everybody to be on the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>page.</v>

2469
01:56:32.071 --> 01:56:33.840
<v Speaker 3>We don't want people cheating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2470
01:56:33.841 --> 01:56:36.480
<v Speaker 3>if this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you watched him fight five rounds,</v>

2471
01:56:36.481 --> 01:56:39.960
<v Speaker 3>there's no more contest coming up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let him do something that's medically</v>

2472
01:56:39.961 --> 01:56:43.150
<v Speaker 3>proven to reduce inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not even marijuana.</v>

2473
01:56:43.151 --> 01:56:44.460
<v Speaker 3>It's CBD oil.</v>

2474
01:56:44.480 --> 01:56:47.990
<v Speaker 2>Also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those punches up probably way worse for</v>

2475
01:56:47.991 --> 01:56:50.090
<v Speaker 2>him than CBD oil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

2476
01:56:50.120 --> 01:56:51.950
<v Speaker 2>It's CBD lungs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good for you.</v>

2477
01:56:52.010 --> 01:56:53.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

2478
01:56:53.330 --> 01:56:55.310
<v Speaker 2>Especially when you have inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2479
01:56:55.311 --> 01:56:58.430
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Should be nate diaz get punched in the</v>

2480
01:56:58.431 --> 01:57:01.850
<v Speaker 2>face before he used cbd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a really good point,</v>

2481
01:57:01.851 --> 01:57:02.470
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2482
01:57:02.470 --> 01:57:05.630
<v Speaker 3>It is a really good point because for</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone to be that hypocritical that you</v>

2483
01:57:05.631 --> 01:57:08.630
<v Speaker 3>let a guy get punched in the head for 25</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking minutes,</v>

2484
01:57:08.810 --> 01:57:12.960
<v Speaker 3>but you won't let them smoke a vape pen</v>
<v Speaker 3>because what you think is cheating is</v>

2485
01:57:13.010 --> 01:57:14.150
<v Speaker 3>cheating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Death as</v>

2486
01:57:14.770 --> 01:57:16.690
<v Speaker 2>will stay alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sadly with football,</v>

2487
01:57:16.940 --> 01:57:18.320
<v Speaker 2>he uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was smoking marijuana.</v>

2488
01:57:18.650 --> 01:57:21.620
<v Speaker 2>Football.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Football is way worse for you.</v>

2489
01:57:21.680 --> 01:57:26.080
<v Speaker 2>Then we'd is worse for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And probably football is worse than</v>

2490
01:57:26.120 --> 01:57:28.250
<v Speaker 2>cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>High hip flag football.</v>

2491
01:57:28.360 --> 01:57:31.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Football is probably worse for you than</v>

2492
01:57:31.330 --> 01:57:34.120
<v Speaker 3>most stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Drinking out of ponds.</v>

2493
01:57:37.480 --> 01:57:39.190
<v Speaker 3>Footballs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking dangerous.</v>

2494
01:57:40.100 --> 01:57:41.440
<v Speaker 3>Super Dangerous Man.</v>

2495
01:57:41.510 --> 01:57:45.500
<v Speaker 2>But they just let it try to maintain a</v>
<v Speaker 2>good image about it.</v>

2496
01:57:45.501 --> 01:57:47.420
<v Speaker 2>But I don't smoke weed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't smoke weed,</v>

2497
01:57:48.140 --> 01:57:51.890
<v Speaker 2>but you might get Hella concussions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but don't smoke weed because that</v>

2498
01:57:51.891 --> 01:57:53.840
<v Speaker 2>doesn't look good for because we gotta</v>
<v Speaker 2>sell this.</v>

2499
01:57:53.841 --> 01:57:55.520
<v Speaker 2>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love the word hello,</v>

2500
01:57:55.521 --> 01:57:58.000
<v Speaker 2>but I'm too old to use it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just turned 49.</v>

2501
01:57:58.250 --> 01:58:00.080
<v Speaker 2>That's what the cut off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just do it man.</v>

2502
01:58:01.390 --> 01:58:04.130
<v Speaker 2>You can say hello.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say Hello.</v>

2503
01:58:04.160 --> 01:58:09.160
<v Speaker 2>You're just encouraging me to say to</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell that girl asked her what her dreams</v>

<v Speaker 3>he pumps you up.</v>

2508

<v Speaker 2>You're telling me as the girl with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>dream I really wanted to ask is so bad.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

2510
01:58:19.440 --> 01:58:23.910
<v Speaker 2>I see a lot of bad ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her vibe was crazy and they might not</v>

2511
01:58:23.920 --> 01:58:26.370
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I wish I took the shot.</v>

2512
01:58:26.640 --> 01:58:28.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would've helped her with her.</v>

2513
01:58:28.320 --> 01:58:30.210
<v Speaker 2>Whatever dreams my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I had,</v>

2514
01:58:30.240 --> 01:58:31.650

<v Speaker 2>You want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can.</v>

2516
01:58:33.360 --> 01:58:36.000
<v Speaker 2>I know somebody like that and you could</v>
<v Speaker 2>find some money.</v>

2517
01:58:36.001 --> 01:58:37.400
<v Speaker 2>If you don't know somebody finds her</v>
<v Speaker 2>mind.</v>

2518
01:58:37.410 --> 01:58:39.780
<v Speaker 2>You can find something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to because she wouldn't be hard</v>

2519
01:58:39.781 --> 01:58:41.410
<v Speaker 2>to find somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw it.</v>

<v Speaker 5>but I think I'm such a city dude where I</v>

2581

<v Speaker 5>get to that.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand that,</v>

2587
02:01:57.761 --> 02:02:01.030
<v Speaker 3>but I liked the views.</v>
<v Speaker 3>However I get antsy,</v>

02:02:01.630 --> 02:02:05.770
<v Speaker 3>but you zen out smooth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could get antsy too.</v>

2589
02:02:06.010 --> 02:02:09.520
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm what I'm trying to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things I'm trying to do by</v>

2590
02:02:09.521 --> 02:02:13.810
<v Speaker 3>going to these places and disconnecting</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a few days is find out what I really</v>

2591
02:02:13.811 --> 02:02:18.040
<v Speaker 3>think about things where it's just me</v>
<v Speaker 3>and my thoughts and interacting with my</v>

2592
02:02:18.041 --> 02:02:20.860
<v Speaker 3>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is one of the good things about</v>

2593
02:02:20.861 --> 02:02:22.680
<v Speaker 3>doing this show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called media.</v>

2594
02:02:22.740 --> 02:02:25.330
<v Speaker 3>This Guy Steve Rinella,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's the host of it is like a really</v>

2595
02:02:25.331 --> 02:02:26.620
<v Speaker 3>smart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really nice guy,</v>

2596
02:02:26.650 --> 02:02:28.990
<v Speaker 3>really interesting guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

2597
02:02:29.050 --> 02:02:30.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like hanging out with him and all of</v>

2598
02:02:30.761 --> 02:02:32.800
<v Speaker 3>his crew and his friends for like all</v>
<v Speaker 3>these days.</v>

2599
02:02:32.810 --> 02:02:35.610
<v Speaker 3>So it's really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in doing that and having it being</v>

2600
02:02:35.620 --> 02:02:37.120
<v Speaker 3>really fun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get to relax.</v>

2601
02:02:37.150 --> 02:02:39.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you get to just sit back and hang</v>

2602
02:02:39.211 --> 02:02:42.610
<v Speaker 3>out with these fun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cool guys and just relax and this is</v>

2603
02:02:42.611 --> 02:02:44.110
<v Speaker 3>your world now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is your tribe,</v>

2604
02:02:44.170 --> 02:02:44.771
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2605
02:02:44.771 --> 02:02:47.770
<v Speaker 3>and he told me that before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that had that sort of how he views it</v>

2606
02:02:48.070 --> 02:02:48.840
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2607
02:02:48.840 --> 02:02:53.830
<v Speaker 3>that it's his tribe and a cool group of</v>
<v Speaker 3>friends and that now I understand it</v>

2608
02:02:53.831 --> 02:02:55.050
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's a,</v>

2609
02:02:55.290 --> 02:02:58.840
<v Speaker 3>I think that disconnecting for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every now and then just take,</v>

2610
02:02:58.900 --> 02:03:01.630
<v Speaker 3>take a few days off just you don't even</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to go anywhere,</v>

2611
02:03:01.810 --> 02:03:06.810
<v Speaker 3>but it's probably a good idea too to</v>
<v Speaker 3>like on purpose take a few days off of</v>

2612
02:03:08.260 --> 02:03:11.260
<v Speaker 3>anything coming in and just let's see</v>
<v Speaker 3>how you feel about things.</v>

2613
02:03:11.440 --> 02:03:16.440
<v Speaker 5>Even if I'm out and about at bar or</v>
<v Speaker 5>something and my phone dies and I'm not</v>

2614
02:03:17.890 --> 02:03:21.280
<v Speaker 5>charging it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I find myself having a fine.</v>

2615
02:03:21.880 --> 02:03:24.710
<v Speaker 5>I realized I'm a really strange person</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I talk to people when you get,</v>

2616
02:03:24.820 --> 02:03:28.570
<v Speaker 5>when you have to really talk to people</v>
<v Speaker 5>for awhile and it's not because now</v>

2617
02:03:28.630 --> 02:03:33.630
<v Speaker 5>pretty much a lot of time if you talking</v>
<v Speaker 5>to somebody is about you talking about</v>

2618
02:03:33.701 --> 02:03:35.050
<v Speaker 5>and then as I do</v>

2619
02:03:37.120 --> 02:03:41.590
<v Speaker 3>phone and so it's a break a break from</v>
<v Speaker 3>the connection</v>

2620
02:03:42.500 --> 02:03:45.320
<v Speaker 5>we're using and everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if you really.</v>

2621
02:03:45.700 --> 02:03:47.870
<v Speaker 5>I mean sometimes I mean on a date or</v>
<v Speaker 5>something,</v>

2622
02:03:47.871 --> 02:03:51.320
<v Speaker 5>I don't go into my shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So really important point.</v>

2623
02:03:51.350 --> 02:03:55.010
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if my shit's dead and I'm just out for</v>

2624
02:03:55.011 --> 02:03:56.960
<v Speaker 5>two hours,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I find that if I'm having long</v>

2625
02:03:56.961 --> 02:03:59.050
<v Speaker 5>conversations and then I started</v>
<v Speaker 5>realizing like,</v>

2626
02:03:59.150 --> 02:04:02.690
<v Speaker 5>Oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm getting kind of weird and intense</v>

2627
02:04:02.691 --> 02:04:05.170
<v Speaker 5>with this person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I started asking because I,</v>

2628
02:04:05.280 --> 02:04:10.250
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>normally I will if I'm talking to</v>

2629
02:04:10.251 --> 02:04:15.251
<v Speaker 5>somebody or I'll do the bullshit regular</v>
<v Speaker 5>questions that we do,</v>

2630
02:04:15.321 --> 02:04:17.630
<v Speaker 5>the way you go to college,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you live here.</v>

2631
02:04:17.660 --> 02:04:18.600
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when did you move from?</v>

2632
02:04:20.510 --> 02:04:22.460
<v Speaker 5>How long have you been doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

2633
02:04:23.180 --> 02:04:24.050
<v Speaker 5>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2634
02:04:24.230 --> 02:04:25.640
<v Speaker 5>and then you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2635
02:04:25.641 --> 02:04:30.641
<v Speaker 5>at some point if you want to read,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you got to get beyond that</v>

2636
02:04:30.780 --> 02:04:31.613
<v Speaker 5>conversationally.</v>

2637

<v Speaker 3>realize,</v>

2655
02:05:10.950 --> 02:05:13.140
<v Speaker 3>It works in some weird way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand it,</v>

2656
02:05:13.650 --> 02:05:15.000
<v Speaker 3>but I got hypnotized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Escape.</v>

2657
02:05:15.030 --> 02:05:17.580
<v Speaker 3>Vinny shoreman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like a mental coach.</v>

2658
02:05:17.580 --> 02:05:22.580
<v Speaker 3>He hypnotized me to do what is your go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just wanted to see if there was anything</v>

2659
02:05:23.281 --> 02:05:26.850
<v Speaker 3>that was holding back the way I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking like in my thinking in the most</v>

2660
02:05:26.851 --> 02:05:31.851
<v Speaker 3>efficient and a logical way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Am I doing the most with my time and my</v>

2661
02:05:32.761 --> 02:05:35.820
<v Speaker 3>not like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do I have any hiccups that I'm not</v>

2662
02:05:35.821 --> 02:05:38.430
<v Speaker 3>paying attention to and the way I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>approaching life.</v>

2663
02:05:38.820 --> 02:05:42.690
<v Speaker 3>So I wanted to talk to him about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I wanted to see what hypnotism really</v>

2664
02:05:42.691 --> 02:05:45.210
<v Speaker 3>yet because I've been talking about</v>
<v Speaker 3>something that I essentially don't have</v>

2665
02:05:45.211 --> 02:05:47.850
<v Speaker 3>any really real understanding of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just say,</v>

2666
02:05:47.860 --> 02:05:49.620
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw people get hypnotized at uh,</v>

2667
02:05:49.970 --> 02:05:53.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Frank Santos comedy show and I saw that.</v>

2668
02:05:53.430 --> 02:05:55.560
<v Speaker 3>How did I find her?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know what I mean?</v>

2669
02:05:55.590 --> 02:05:56.580
<v Speaker 3>I found this dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

2670
02:05:56.581 --> 02:05:57.181
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he does,</v>

2671
02:05:57.181 --> 02:05:59.820
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hypnotism and mental coaching for MMA</v>

2672
02:05:59.821 --> 02:06:00.680
<v Speaker 3>fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2673
02:06:01.050 --> 02:06:01.651
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2674
02:06:01.651 --> 02:06:02.490
<v Speaker 3>it was interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2675
02:06:02.490 --> 02:06:03.950
<v Speaker 3>It was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like a.</v>

2676
02:06:04.320 --> 02:06:06.600
<v Speaker 3>When you get hypnotized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how long is this session?</v>

2677
02:06:06.601 --> 02:06:07.980
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's about an hour and a half.</v>

2678
02:06:08.380 --> 02:06:09.670
<v Speaker 3>About an hour and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When,</v>

2679
02:06:09.690 --> 02:06:13.170
<v Speaker 3>when you get hypnotized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are aware that this person is</v>

2680
02:06:13.171 --> 02:06:15.390
<v Speaker 3>talking to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like you're in some space</v>

2681
02:06:15.391 --> 02:06:18.450
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the world that you're living in with</v>

2682
02:06:18.451 --> 02:06:22.140
<v Speaker 3>your eyes closed in this state is a very</v>
<v Speaker 3>different world.</v>

2683
02:06:22.380 --> 02:06:25.200
<v Speaker 3>It's like if this person can command</v>
<v Speaker 3>your attention,</v>

2684
02:06:25.201 --> 02:06:28.890
<v Speaker 3>your focus for a certain amount of time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it lets all this other stuff sort of</v>

2685
02:06:28.920 --> 02:06:33.360
<v Speaker 3>passed by and when the person does it</v>
<v Speaker 3>with no judgment,</v>

2686
02:06:33.361 --> 02:06:37.200
<v Speaker 3>just trying to understand the way you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>feeling and thinking you allow yourself</v>

2687
02:06:37.201 --> 02:06:40.080
<v Speaker 3>to slip in to this strange state of</v>
<v Speaker 3>mind.</v>

2688
02:06:40.540 --> 02:06:41.970
<v Speaker 3>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really weird.</v>

2689
02:06:41.971 --> 02:06:44.070
<v Speaker 3>Like it'll wake up immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if,</v>

2690
02:06:44.071 --> 02:06:45.610
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you heard like an alarm going off,</v>

2691
02:06:45.910 --> 02:06:50.190
<v Speaker 3>like</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not like you're drugged,</v>

2692
02:06:50.640 --> 02:06:52.620
<v Speaker 3>but it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a bunch of different</v>

2693
02:06:52.621 --> 02:06:55.440
<v Speaker 3>states of consciousness leading from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>dream world,</v>

2694
02:06:55.620 --> 02:06:58.950
<v Speaker 3>which we all voluntarily go into every</v>
<v Speaker 3>night when we go to sleep,</v>

2695
02:06:59.290 --> 02:07:00.660
<v Speaker 3>we go on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go to sleep,</v>

2696
02:07:00.661 --> 02:07:02.670
<v Speaker 3>we conk out and we have dreams.</v>

2697
02:07:02.670 --> 02:07:04.980
<v Speaker 3>We remember them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we remember them,</v>

2698
02:07:05.280 --> 02:07:06.890
<v Speaker 3>remember them all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

2699
02:07:06.980 --> 02:07:09.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have some wacky fucking idea that</v>

2700
02:07:09.481 --> 02:07:11.070
<v Speaker 3>came into your head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't make any sense.</v>

2701
02:07:11.670 --> 02:07:15.060
<v Speaker 3>And I think there's states of</v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness from being totally awake</v>

2702
02:07:15.300 --> 02:07:19.230
<v Speaker 3>fearing for your life because you're in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the middle of an earthquake to being</v>

2703
02:07:19.231 --> 02:07:22.680
<v Speaker 3>like drifting in and out of dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2704
02:07:22.770 --> 02:07:25.410
<v Speaker 3>where you're not sure you're there or</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not there and you wait.</v>

2705
02:07:25.550 --> 02:07:26.370
<v Speaker 3>What was that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Real?</v>

2706
02:07:26.370 --> 02:07:27.480
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2707
02:07:27.481 --> 02:07:30.870
<v Speaker 3>you're sitting in your car maybe at a</v>
<v Speaker 3>road stop.</v>

2708
02:07:30.871 --> 02:07:32.760
<v Speaker 3>You got a six hour drive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

2709
02:07:32.761 --> 02:07:35.010
<v Speaker 3>let me just pull over for an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was drifting.</v>

2710
02:07:35.510 --> 02:07:36.520
<v Speaker 3>You're not sure if your sleep.</v>

2711
02:07:36.850 --> 02:07:41.850
<v Speaker 5>Do you ever just close my eyes and just</v>
<v Speaker 5>start seeing weird as colors and shapes</v>

2712
02:07:43.200 --> 02:07:43.590
<v Speaker 5>and.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Shit,</v>

2713
02:07:43.590 --> 02:07:45.060
<v Speaker 5>not even hot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2714
02:07:45.150 --> 02:07:50.150
<v Speaker 5>but just I'll just close wise and then</v>
<v Speaker 5>like now it's nothing but certain times</v>

2715
02:07:51.380 --> 02:07:55.050
<v Speaker 5>it would just be weird shapes and just</v>
<v Speaker 5>different.</v>

2716
02:07:55.920 --> 02:07:59.700
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty cold where your brain can</v>
<v Speaker 3>make all kinds of funky chemicals man</v>

2717
02:08:00.390 --> 02:08:03.750
<v Speaker 3>and they don't necessarily exactly know</v>
<v Speaker 3>why.</v>

2718
02:08:04.260 --> 02:08:06.960
<v Speaker 3>It's not like there's a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 3>different things that you can do to make</v>

2719
02:08:06.961 --> 02:08:10.590
<v Speaker 3>your brain produce certain chemicals</v>
<v Speaker 3>like in a row,</v>

2720
02:08:10.591 --> 02:08:11.960
<v Speaker 3>like as far as like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2721
02:08:12.060 --> 02:08:16.560
<v Speaker 3>maybe you can like skip rope for 20</v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes and do 50 deep breathing</v>

2722
02:08:16.561 --> 02:08:20.400
<v Speaker 3>exercises and you'll get into a like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic state.</v>

2723
02:08:20.850 --> 02:08:24.630
<v Speaker 3>No one's exactly sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what the fuck it is that allows</v>

2724
02:08:24.631 --> 02:08:28.170
<v Speaker 3>people to get to certain states and</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether or not like the way your brain</v>

2725
02:08:28.171 --> 02:08:30.510
<v Speaker 3>works is the same as my brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Definitely.</v>

2726
02:08:30.511 --> 02:08:31.740
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't make any sense.</v>

2727
02:08:31.741 --> 02:08:33.870
<v Speaker 3>Why would it be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we all know,</v>

2728
02:08:33.871 --> 02:08:37.290
<v Speaker 3>like I hear people saying I can't</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking sing at all.</v>

2729
02:08:37.500 --> 02:08:40.830
<v Speaker 3>I hear people saying and I hear like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>beautiful voice like we were.</v>

2730
02:08:40.850 --> 02:08:44.790
<v Speaker 3>We're walking by some people the other</v>
<v Speaker 3>night in Vegas when we were on our way</v>

2731
02:08:44.791 --> 02:08:48.480
<v Speaker 3>to go eat after the fights and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a this guy and this girl,</v>

2732
02:08:48.481 --> 02:08:50.910
<v Speaker 3>they were saying they must have been a</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of some team or something like</v>

2733
02:08:50.911 --> 02:08:51.420
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They might have.</v>

2734
02:08:51.420 --> 02:08:54.450
<v Speaker 3>It must have been some entertainers</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they were way too good and they</v>

2735
02:08:54.451 --> 02:08:56.820
<v Speaker 3>were saying it and they were singing</v>
<v Speaker 3>with each other and they were singing</v>

2736
02:08:56.821 --> 02:09:00.000
<v Speaker 3>with each other in harmony in this</v>
<v Speaker 3>hallway and everybody was like,</v>

2737
02:09:00.001 --> 02:09:02.940
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they just had a sound.</v>

2738
02:09:03.680 --> 02:09:06.350
<v Speaker 5>They made this the exact that appeal to</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody.</v>

2739
02:09:07.440 --> 02:09:11.090
<v Speaker 5>That's something my wheelhouse here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but my.</v>

2740
02:09:11.770 --> 02:09:16.770
<v Speaker 5>My brain is super sensitive to when</v>
<v Speaker 5>sounds off and sometimes you go to a.</v>

2741
02:09:22.250 --> 02:09:26.480
<v Speaker 5>If you go to karaoke spot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>somebody doing karaoke and if they pick</v>

2742
02:09:27.320 --> 02:09:31.820
<v Speaker 5>the rock songs and pop songs will sort</v>
<v Speaker 5>of be the exact beats,</v>

2743
02:09:32.840 --> 02:09:37.250
<v Speaker 5>the hip hop songs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The beats will have this.</v>

2744
02:09:38.120 --> 02:09:43.120
<v Speaker 5>It's a different version of it or it it</v>
<v Speaker 5>just and it drives me crazy.</v>

2745
02:09:43.701 --> 02:09:48.701
<v Speaker 5>It's certain things with music like</v>
<v Speaker 5>little shifts in music that drive me</v>

2746
02:09:50.870 --> 02:09:55.430
<v Speaker 5>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I hate when songs are a,</v>

2747
02:09:56.090 --> 02:10:01.090
<v Speaker 5>I don't like when there's acoustic</v>
<v Speaker 5>versions of gangster rap songs that</v>

2748
02:10:02.901 --> 02:10:06.510
<v Speaker 5>makes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That drives me crazy sonically in</v>

2749
02:10:06.540 --> 02:10:11.410
<v Speaker 5>certain just musical things that just</v>
<v Speaker 5>pissed me.</v>

2750
02:10:11.480 --> 02:10:12.970
<v Speaker 5>It just in that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a.</v>

2751
02:10:13.030 --> 02:10:17.750
<v Speaker 5>not in a good logical.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just that type of thing where I'm</v>

2752
02:10:17.751 --> 02:10:19.940
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have to leave here.</v>

2753
02:10:20.300 --> 02:10:23.660
<v Speaker 5>Yesterday by Uber driver from the</v>
<v Speaker 5>airport,</v>

2754
02:10:24.870 --> 02:10:28.100
<v Speaker 5>which I.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was playing his own mix tape.</v>

2755
02:10:28.101 --> 02:10:29.660
<v Speaker 5>He didn't say he was playing his own mix</v>
<v Speaker 5>tape,</v>

2756
02:10:29.661 --> 02:10:32.060
<v Speaker 5>but I could feel that he was planning on</v>
<v Speaker 5>mixtape because you played the same</v>

2757
02:10:32.061 --> 02:10:34.160
<v Speaker 5>music for 40.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

2758
02:10:34.570 --> 02:10:39.570
<v Speaker 2>The rapper name began withK ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his name began with Kate on Uber and it</v>

2759
02:10:40.521 --> 02:10:43.330
<v Speaker 2>was bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was really bad hit.</v>

2760
02:10:43.331 --> 02:10:45.050
<v Speaker 2>The beats was already,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's bad.</v>

2761
02:10:45.310 --> 02:10:48.950
<v Speaker 2>He had no charisma on the mic and it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>just.</v>

2762
02:10:49.630 --> 02:10:54.630
<v Speaker 2>And so now I'm sitting here and I just</v>
<v Speaker 2>decided I was going to take this.</v>

2763
02:10:55.840 --> 02:10:59.150
<v Speaker 2>Just take it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just take how angry this is making me</v>

2764
02:10:59.690 --> 02:11:03.230
<v Speaker 2>because I don't want to give him the</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation because he wants me to be</v>

2765
02:11:03.231 --> 02:11:05.600
<v Speaker 2>a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wants me to say who's this?</v>

2788
02:12:02.720 --> 02:12:04.730
<v Speaker 2>All black BMW.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the word.</v>

2789
02:12:04.731 --> 02:12:07.310
<v Speaker 2>And the hook isn't not the melody</v>
<v Speaker 2>necessary because I didn't use any</v>

2790
02:12:07.311 --> 02:12:09.850
<v Speaker 2>magic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

2793
02:12:15.210 --> 02:12:17.580
<v Speaker 2>cars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no lyrics or no lyrics about,</v>

<v Speaker 2>and trying to make it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>in a serious conversation.</v>

2820
02:13:34.051 --> 02:13:37.200
<v Speaker 2>of a great song for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I got to keep listening to this</v>

<v Speaker 2>overdose,</v>

<v Speaker 2>just a simple Oregon plan.</v>

2824
02:13:49.141 --> 02:13:53.190
<v Speaker 2>He's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's singing sorta saying rapping and</v>

2825
02:13:53.220 --> 02:13:54.750
<v Speaker 2>it's a bunch of good songs and I</v>

02:13:59.490 --> 02:14:01.740
<v Speaker 2>15 times in a row.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that interesting?</v>

2830
02:14:01.880 --> 02:14:03.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a lot of things like that.</v>

2831
02:14:03.691 --> 02:14:07.890
<v Speaker 2>Like movies definitely aren't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A comedy definitely isn't like that.</v>

2832
02:14:07.920 --> 02:14:09.620
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's something about songs.</v>

2833
02:14:09.740 --> 02:14:13.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm certain somebody though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some stuff with comedy with me,</v>

2834
02:14:13.201 --> 02:14:17.190
<v Speaker 2>certain timing moves that people do</v>
<v Speaker 2>certain bits.</v>

2835

2837
02:14:21.750 --> 02:14:25.770
<v Speaker 2>she tolerated but she probably hated it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will be certain things like a quick,</v>

2838
02:14:25.860 --> 02:14:30.030
<v Speaker 2>a weird thing in a show and I would just</v>

<v Speaker 2>of built on is that people wanted to</v>

2987
02:21:35.300 --> 02:21:37.970
<v Speaker 2>He told my,</v>

02:21:52.580 --> 02:21:54.210
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's weird seat.</v>

2993
02:21:54.240 --> 02:21:57.540
<v Speaker 3>The idea of people working alongside</v>
<v Speaker 3>each other day in day out,</v>

2994
02:21:57.541 --> 02:22:00.360
<v Speaker 3>men and women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all group together in these boxes is</v>

2995
02:22:00.361 --> 02:22:03.840
<v Speaker 3>entirely unnatural.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When people would be around each other</v>

2996
02:22:03.841 --> 02:22:05.820
<v Speaker 3>in the wild,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would do it because they liked each</v>

2997
02:22:05.821 --> 02:22:10.170
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am completely back in his day.</v>

2998
02:22:10.171 --> 02:22:11.940
<v Speaker 3>Did I never lived in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2999
02:22:12.190 --> 02:22:16.770
<v Speaker 3>My obsession is in the genetic</v>
<v Speaker 3>propensity that we have inherited from</v>

3000
02:22:16.771 --> 02:22:19.740
<v Speaker 3>these people and I think that in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>wild,</v>

3001
02:22:19.980 --> 02:22:21.840
<v Speaker 3>men and women never like grouped up</v>
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>

3002
02:22:21.841 --> 02:22:25.650
<v Speaker 3>They didn't like each other but in work</v>
<v Speaker 3>they do and it creates this weird</v>

3003
02:22:25.651 --> 02:22:26.070
<v Speaker 3>tension</v>

3004
02:22:26.070 --> 02:22:29.780
<v Speaker 1>where management proved themselves and</v>
<v Speaker 1>women are trying to prove themselves and</v>

3005
02:22:29.790 --> 02:22:32.300
<v Speaker 1>no group pond back there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all about growth.</v>

3006
02:22:32.850 --> 02:22:34.170
<v Speaker 1>It's groupon now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3007

<v Speaker 1>you didn't get lucky back then.</v>

3009
02:22:38.420 --> 02:22:41.550
<v Speaker 1>Like back then you just decided you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to hang out with certain people</v>

3010
02:22:41.850 --> 02:22:43.710
<v Speaker 1>and the other ones who killed.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It was no waiting it out.</v>

3012
02:22:46.540 --> 02:22:49.620
<v Speaker 1>Now there's no way to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just waited it out late night and just</v>

3013
02:22:49.621 --> 02:22:52.940
<v Speaker 1>hung out at the bar and in some got</v>
<v Speaker 1>popping those,</v>

3014
02:22:52.970 --> 02:22:54.930

<v Speaker 1>It was just either she liked you because</v>

3015
02:22:54.931 --> 02:22:58.970
<v Speaker 1>you were just strong and you brought</v>
<v Speaker 1>food and killed it.</v>

3016
02:22:59.500 --> 02:23:03.800
<v Speaker 1>You see them like you at out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You develop the first catapult tall</v>

3065
02:25:22.960 --> 02:25:24.100
<v Speaker 1>the energy in that</v>

3066
02:25:24.100 --> 02:25:25.860
<v Speaker 2>room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] little ass belly.</v>

3067
02:25:25.880 --> 02:25:28.060
<v Speaker 2>Rome hunted some people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's packed in there.</v>

3068
02:25:28.630 --> 02:25:31.900
<v Speaker 2>They got to keep it in that fucking room</v>
<v Speaker 2>to fight it off.</v>

3069
02:25:32.440 --> 02:25:34.660
<v Speaker 2>Just fight it off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No matter what they say about that main</v>

3070
02:25:34.661 --> 02:25:35.830
<v Speaker 2>room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Togo in there,</v>

3071
02:25:36.070 --> 02:25:37.410
<v Speaker 2>that's not the place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>

3072
02:25:37.430 --> 02:25:38.670
<v Speaker 2>It's not the place for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3073
02:25:38.910 --> 02:25:42.940
<v Speaker 2>I went to the TV taping in Montreal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3074
02:25:42.941 --> 02:25:45.160
<v Speaker 2>you got some feelings about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did you feel about it?</v>

3075
02:25:46.120 --> 02:25:47.790
<v Speaker 2>I just feel about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt good about it.</v>

3076
02:25:47.791 --> 02:25:49.330
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3077
02:25:49.420 --> 02:25:54.160
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm also biased because I've seen it.</v>

3078
02:25:54.400 --> 02:25:57.760
<v Speaker 2>I think my first time there was maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>two years ago,</v>

3079
02:25:57.920 --> 02:26:01.510
<v Speaker 2>right close to that in the belly room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3080
02:26:01.640 --> 02:26:02.440
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3081
02:26:02.440 --> 02:26:04.930
<v Speaker 2>and I've seen even within the belly</v>
<v Speaker 2>room,</v>

3082
02:26:05.680 --> 02:26:09.880
<v Speaker 2>different things they've done to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>show in that just different things with</v>

3083
02:26:09.881 --> 02:26:12.410
<v Speaker 2>the djs are with the wave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the,</v>

3084
02:26:12.810 --> 02:26:16.720
<v Speaker 2>with uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the racist over there and tweaks</v>

3085
02:26:16.721 --> 02:26:20.530
<v Speaker 2>that they've made in there to make the</v>
<v Speaker 2>show work.</v>

3086
02:26:20.950 --> 02:26:25.360
<v Speaker 2>And so to see something that you've been</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a bunch of times in this small space</v>

3087
02:26:25.840 --> 02:26:27.740
<v Speaker 2>and then see it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3088
02:26:27.790 --> 02:26:30.790
<v Speaker 2>be in the beat in the same spot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>watching it live.</v>

3089
02:26:31.750 --> 02:26:34.060
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's cool to see something like that,</v>

3090
02:26:34.061 --> 02:26:37.420
<v Speaker 2>to see that type of progression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It felt,</v>

3091
02:26:37.480 --> 02:26:38.920
<v Speaker 2>it felt amazing,</v>

3094
02:26:44.981 --> 02:26:47.890
<v Speaker 2>the space always has to be to be right</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this,</v>

3095
02:26:47.891 --> 02:26:50.560
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's uh,</v>

3096
02:26:51.130 --> 02:26:53.650
<v Speaker 2>it's different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was like a motivational speech for</v>

<v Speaker 2>expanding your theater side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3099
02:26:57.030 --> 02:26:58.360
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was just,</v>

3100
02:26:58.540 --> 02:27:00.580
<v Speaker 2>it was cool to see that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was.</v>

3101
02:27:01.270 --> 02:27:02.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I've had the,</v>

3102
02:27:03.370 --> 02:27:08.370
<v Speaker 2>I've seen that with a comedians or</v>
<v Speaker 2>friends of mine,</v>

3103
02:27:10.990 --> 02:27:13.450
<v Speaker 2>that type of progression from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3104
02:27:14.030 --> 02:27:17.140
<v Speaker 2>over Micah to middle atrophy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jack to somebody,</v>

3105
02:27:17.200 --> 02:27:19.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being on shows and being famous,</v>

3106
02:27:19.540 --> 02:27:21.130
<v Speaker 2>but I never saw that with.</v>

3107
02:27:21.410 --> 02:27:23.830
<v Speaker 2>I can't think of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw that with a show concept.</v>

3108
02:27:23.860 --> 02:27:28.000
<v Speaker 2>Maybe have a couple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just something I attended regularly</v>

3109
02:27:28.630 --> 02:27:33.550
<v Speaker 2>to see it go from a live show and go</v>
<v Speaker 2>there and enjoy it as a live show and</v>

3110
02:27:33.551 --> 02:27:34.830
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3111
02:27:35.020 --> 02:27:38.710
<v Speaker 2>have it be live on comedy central.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was something cool.</v>

3112
02:27:38.860 --> 02:27:41.650
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy watching that now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was really happy for them.</v>

3113
02:27:41.890 --> 02:27:42.521
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I completely agree.</v>

3115
02:27:43.811 --> 02:27:45.340
<v Speaker 2>All jokes aside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3116
02:27:45.341 --> 02:27:46.174
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3117
02:27:46.180 --> 02:27:49.090
<v Speaker 2>what they've managed to do by getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>that show on the air,</v>

3118
02:27:49.091 --> 02:27:51.910
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty monumental because there's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>god damn brutal show,</v>

3131
02:28:20.770 --> 02:28:22.010

3135
02:28:28.040 --> 02:28:32.630
<v Speaker 5>the host is always is Jeff Ross</v>

3139
02:28:41.360 --> 02:28:44.380
<v Speaker 3>fuck with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's gonna basically be in the same</v>

3140
02:28:44.381 --> 02:28:46.930
<v Speaker 3>state that it's always been in sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>racist.</v>

3141
02:28:46.990 --> 02:28:49.680
<v Speaker 3>They can have the racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

3142
02:28:49.990 --> 02:28:52.420
<v Speaker 3>here's my only feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is my only feeling.</v>

3143
02:28:52.570 --> 02:28:54.790
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a problem with them doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a problem with anything,</v>

3144
02:28:55.060 --> 02:28:58.090
<v Speaker 3>but I wouldn't suggest them filming</v>
<v Speaker 3>those shows.</v>

3145
02:28:58.270 --> 02:29:01.840
<v Speaker 3>I would suggest them doing those shows</v>
<v Speaker 3>at filming.</v>

3146
02:29:01.841 --> 02:29:06.841
<v Speaker 3>The family room shows there is a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a world in that room when when</v>

3147
02:29:07.961 --> 02:29:11.170
<v Speaker 3>someone's killing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when earl came out for that rose</v>

3148
02:29:11.171 --> 02:29:14.860
<v Speaker 3>paddle thing and just destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember that night he came out with a</v>

3149
02:29:14.861 --> 02:29:17.200
<v Speaker 3>fur coat on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We did you see that on comedy central?</v>

3150
02:29:17.680 --> 02:29:21.130
<v Speaker 3>Do they filmed it and it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a magic because there's 90 people</v>

3151
02:29:21.131 --> 02:29:23.920
<v Speaker 3>in there and they smushed slight scar</v>
<v Speaker 3>sardines packed.</v>

3152
02:29:23.921 --> 02:29:27.760
<v Speaker 3>It's a vibe in the EU,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you everything has to be in line when</v>

3153
02:29:27.761 --> 02:29:31.390
<v Speaker 3>you're killing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a frequency you have to hit and</v>

3154
02:29:31.420 --> 02:29:35.640
<v Speaker 3>earl was just on that frequency and when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see someone do something like that</v>

3155
02:29:35.641 --> 02:29:37.870
<v Speaker 3>in a small room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you realize that's the value of the</v>

3156
02:29:37.871 --> 02:29:39.120
<v Speaker 3>smaller room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3157
02:29:39.220 --> 02:29:40.980
<v Speaker 3>What a small room is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that.</v>

3158
02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:41.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3159
02:29:42.550 --> 02:29:44.260
<v Speaker 5>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is a video of those guys,</v>

3160
02:29:44.820 --> 02:29:46.550
<v Speaker 3>but when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're in a small [inaudible],</v>

3161
02:29:47.340 --> 02:29:50.580
<v Speaker 3>when you're in a small room like that</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you just let it all hang out,</v>

3162
02:29:50.970 --> 02:29:55.950
<v Speaker 3>there's a weird fucking energy that</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a weird connection to that.</v>

3163
02:29:55.951 --> 02:29:59.130
<v Speaker 3>It's different than anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's way different than a big place,</v>

3164
02:29:59.280 --> 02:30:02.250
<v Speaker 3>like a big place as nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's beautiful to be there.</v>

3165
02:30:02.370 --> 02:30:05.700
<v Speaker 3>It's cool to be a part of like 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>people came to see Rose Battle.</v>

3166
02:30:05.701 --> 02:30:06.534

<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

3167
02:30:06.570 --> 02:30:11.570
<v Speaker 3>but the best show is that 90 seat belly</v>
<v Speaker 3>room or 80 seat,</v>

3168
02:30:11.700 --> 02:30:13.440
<v Speaker 3>whatever the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fire codes.</v>

3169
02:30:13.990 --> 02:30:17.020
<v Speaker 5>One of the best jokes I've heard there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was,</v>

3170
02:30:17.021 --> 02:30:22.021
<v Speaker 5>I could remember this comedian's name,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's Ah,</v>

<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have a,</v>

3172
02:30:23.080 --> 02:30:28.080
<v Speaker 5>a joke does new.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That sounds like it's from the fifties</v>

3173
02:30:28.511 --> 02:30:31.870
<v Speaker 5>or sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just instructure and brevity.</v>

3174
02:30:33.040 --> 02:30:33.980
<v Speaker 5>This,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3175
02:30:34.080 --> 02:30:36.880
<v Speaker 5>this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he says that his girl,</v>

3176
02:30:36.881 --> 02:30:41.320
<v Speaker 5>he says she's in an on and off</v>
<v Speaker 5>relationship.</v>

3177
02:30:41.321 --> 02:30:46.321
<v Speaker 5>Whatever boyfriend is on when he sees</v>
<v Speaker 5>her body off when he sees her face.</v>

3178
02:30:49.330 --> 02:30:52.900
<v Speaker 5>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like that you.</v>

3179
02:30:53.330 --> 02:30:54.400
<v Speaker 5>Because I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that sounds like.</v>

3180
02:30:55.330 --> 02:30:57.660
<v Speaker 5>It sounds like you heard it before,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you didn't.</v>

3181
02:30:57.730 --> 02:30:59.080
<v Speaker 5>I haven't heard it before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3182
02:30:59.081 --> 02:31:02.130
<v Speaker 5>I never heard it before,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's short.</v>

3183
02:31:02.380 --> 02:31:06.330
<v Speaker 5>I sound like I sound like some old shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your uncle would say we never.</v>

3184
02:31:06.790 --> 02:31:08.270
<v Speaker 5>That was a fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

3185
02:31:08.310 --> 02:31:11.590
<v Speaker 5>I've heard many great jokes that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that one just stuck in my head.</v>

<v Speaker 2>combination of words.</v>

<v Speaker 2>danger.</v>

3257
02:34:27.310 --> 02:34:30.640
<v Speaker 2>One of the walkers shit themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How often do you have to swim away from</v>

3258
02:34:30.641 --> 02:34:32.530
<v Speaker 2>danger?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might save a couple of laps.</v>

3259
02:34:32.860 --> 02:34:35.080
<v Speaker 2>Usain bolt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes save some lives.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I got I got out or somebody is attacking</v>

<v Speaker 2>you usually not around water like that</v>

3264
02:34:43.061 --> 02:34:45.190
<v Speaker 2>to get away from danger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hm.</v>

3265
02:34:47.340 --> 02:34:48.120
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the point,</v>

3266
02:34:48.120 --> 02:34:51.060
<v Speaker 3>like why so many strokes?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why limit the way you move?</v>

3267
02:34:51.780 --> 02:34:54.180
<v Speaker 3>Like if you're going to swim,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like why do you have to swim at a very</v>

3268
02:34:54.181 --> 02:34:57.240
<v Speaker 3>specific way?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If this breast stroke thing was so</v>

3269
02:34:57.241 --> 02:34:59.880
<v Speaker 3>fucking good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would it be the fastest way to do this?</v>

3270
02:35:00.060 --> 02:35:01.070
<v Speaker 3>Why don't we.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's.</v>

3271
02:35:01.130 --> 02:35:04.050
<v Speaker 3>Let's pretend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's pretend this is the only shitty</v>

3272
02:35:04.051 --> 02:35:07.020
<v Speaker 3>way we know how to swim.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's just fucking throw our arms in</v>

3273
02:35:07.021 --> 02:35:09.000
<v Speaker 3>front of ourselves like we're part in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the curtains,</v>

3274
02:35:09.180 --> 02:35:13.590
<v Speaker 3>like those beads at the porno section of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the video store before there were dvrs</v>

3275
02:35:13.870 --> 02:35:17.430
<v Speaker 3>and and dvds and you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pardon</v>

<v Speaker 2>they going to have the fucking breast</v>

3277
02:35:20.620 --> 02:35:22.750
<v Speaker 2>stroke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't have this stroke.</v>

3278
02:35:23.550 --> 02:35:27.280
<v Speaker 2>If they don't have this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then why not just have a fucking Olympic</v>

3279
02:35:27.281 --> 02:35:30.730
<v Speaker 2>competition where you just run,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you hide me and the whole time too.</v>

3280
02:35:30.731 --> 02:35:31.630
<v Speaker 2>Very good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Passionate.</v>

3281
02:35:31.690 --> 02:35:34.660
<v Speaker 2>Let's have backwards running.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you've got the backstroke wise,</v>

3282
02:35:34.661 --> 02:35:36.700
<v Speaker 2>there's no backwards running in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Olympics</v>

3283
02:35:36.790 --> 02:35:39.340
<v Speaker 3>from now on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we should call that that move the porn</v>

3284
02:35:39.341 --> 02:35:41.860
<v Speaker 3>section.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is you partying.</v>

3285
02:35:41.861 --> 02:35:44.770
<v Speaker 3>The beads that are hanging.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet when they fucking.</v>

3286
02:35:44.840 --> 02:35:47.740
<v Speaker 3>When when video games went under or</v>

3287
02:35:47.741 --> 02:35:52.540
<v Speaker 3>a videos video rentals went under.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet the bead industry dropped</v>

3288
02:35:52.541 --> 02:35:55.360
<v Speaker 3>substantially.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been a big part of their profits</v>

3289
02:35:55.510 --> 02:35:58.870
<v Speaker 3>was beating off the porn sections.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm dating myself here,</v>

3290
02:35:59.140 --> 02:36:01.540
<v Speaker 3>but you guys don't even understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You guys are both young guns.</v>

3291
02:36:01.900 --> 02:36:04.060
<v Speaker 3>When I was a boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was a boy,</v>

3292
02:36:05.510 --> 02:36:08.110
<v Speaker 3>you could rent videos and you could rent</v>
<v Speaker 3>porn videos.</v>

3293
02:36:08.170 --> 02:36:12.370
<v Speaker 3>That's how I going go to the get drunk</v>
<v Speaker 3>and leave for me for one minute.</v>

3294
02:36:12.610 --> 02:36:15.670
<v Speaker 3>Drunkenly Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was kid,</v>

3295
02:36:16.370 --> 02:36:19.000
<v Speaker 3>Hannibal burress can't handle his</v>
<v Speaker 3>bladder.</v>

3296
02:36:19.001 --> 02:36:23.830
<v Speaker 3>I guess</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hung in there.</v>

3297
02:36:23.831 --> 02:36:24.820
<v Speaker 3>Folks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did my best,</v>

3298
02:36:25.150 --> 02:36:29.770
<v Speaker 3>but Louis Theroux during that podcast</v>
<v Speaker 3>with him for three hours and then I have</v>

3299
02:36:30.160 --> 02:36:32.080
<v Speaker 3>some water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like an asshole in between.</v>

3300
02:36:32.760 --> 02:36:34.510
<v Speaker 3>Couldn't hang in there folks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm so sorry.</v>

3301
02:36:36.670 --> 02:36:37.840
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're just talking about Jamie.</v>

3302
02:36:37.900 --> 02:36:38.733
<v Speaker 3>Were you paying attention?</v>

3303
02:36:39.390 --> 02:36:41.210
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

3304
02:36:42.580 --> 02:36:44.890
<v Speaker 3>God dammit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Olympics.</v>

3305
02:36:45.120 --> 02:36:46.120
<v Speaker 3>Swimming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Swimming.</v>

3306
02:36:46.170 --> 02:36:47.830
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>limiting your movement.</v>

3307
02:36:47.980 --> 02:36:50.770
<v Speaker 3>Is it ridiculous?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the idea that someone's going to</v>

3308
02:36:50.771 --> 02:36:51.430
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3309
02:36:51.430 --> 02:36:53.650
<v Speaker 3>you can swim,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he can't swim at your best.</v>

3310
02:36:54.370 --> 02:36:56.500
<v Speaker 3>Swimming some goofy way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not efficient.</v>

3311
02:36:57.160 --> 02:36:57.993
<v Speaker 3>Go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Try that.</v>

3312
02:36:58.150 --> 02:37:02.100
<v Speaker 3>Because if somebody could just do breast</v>
<v Speaker 3>stroke only versus a freestyle swimmer,</v>

3313
02:37:02.110 --> 02:37:03.070
<v Speaker 3>they would never win.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3314
02:37:03.920 --> 02:37:04.360
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3315
02:37:04.360 --> 02:37:05.193
<v Speaker 2>no way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3316
02:37:05.740 --> 02:37:07.120
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mostly Olympic events.</v>

3317
02:37:07.121 --> 02:37:09.910
<v Speaker 2>Our events that we're looking at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any way I'm confused.</v>

3318
02:37:10.420 --> 02:37:13.300
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a super big fan of curling,</v>

3319
02:37:13.301 --> 02:37:14.770
<v Speaker 3>so I'm gonna tell you to fuck off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3320
02:37:15.920 --> 02:37:16.040
<v Speaker 3>You</v>

<v Speaker 1>like the panel will you ever see curling</v>

<v Speaker 1>excited about it?</v>

3323
02:37:21.800 --> 02:37:23.880
<v Speaker 1>The Winter Olympic sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in a,</v>

3324
02:37:24.010 --> 02:37:26.590
<v Speaker 1>I think it was newfoundland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new found land,</v>

3325
02:37:27.040 --> 02:37:29.380
<v Speaker 1>Newfoundland for Gig.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great time.</v>

3327
02:37:30.461 --> 02:37:32.950
<v Speaker 1>Nice people when long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>no them for killed back Newfoundland</v>
<v Speaker 1>recently to do it.</v>

3329
02:37:37.870 --> 02:37:38.890
<v Speaker 1>I would totally do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3330
02:37:38.891 --> 02:37:40.590
<v Speaker 1>why haven't you done it to do weird</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

3331
02:37:41.500 --> 02:37:43.440
<v Speaker 1>It's been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's only a certain amount of your</v>

3332
02:37:43.510 --> 02:37:47.710
<v Speaker 1>agents is filled up very quickly with</v>
<v Speaker 1>metropolis areas.</v>

3333
02:37:47.950 --> 02:37:50.400
<v Speaker 1>Have you been an ambassador for UFC</v>
<v Speaker 1>Newfoundland?</v>

3334
02:37:50.440 --> 02:37:54.100
<v Speaker 1>Point being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried erroneously to make fun of</v>

3335
02:37:54.101 --> 02:37:56.970
<v Speaker 1>curling while I was in newfoundland</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the,</v>

3336
02:37:56.980 --> 02:37:59.800
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stage always the place we were at</v>

3337
02:37:59.801 --> 02:38:01.780
<v Speaker 1>how all these photos with people</v>
<v Speaker 1>curling.</v>

3338
02:38:01.990 --> 02:38:05.080
<v Speaker 1>So the dude with the broom and the dude</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the fucking hockey,</v>

3339
02:38:05.081 --> 02:38:06.610
<v Speaker 1>the giant steroid it out.</v>

3340
02:38:06.630 --> 02:38:08.740
<v Speaker 1>Hockey puck there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slide across the ground.</v>

3341
02:38:09.100 --> 02:38:11.920
<v Speaker 1>It's so good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you try to run this meaning that</v>

3342
02:38:12.010 --> 02:38:14.260
<v Speaker 1>tried joking around about it and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>will not win it.</v>

3343
02:38:14.470 --> 02:38:16.720
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh.</v>

3344
02:38:17.510 --> 02:38:19.340
<v Speaker 1>They loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They loved their curling.</v>

3345
02:38:19.670 --> 02:38:22.820
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand it,</v>

3346
02:38:22.850 --> 02:38:26.680
<v Speaker 1>but I guess I don't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to.</v>

3347
02:38:26.690 --> 02:38:27.960
<v Speaker 1>They like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They like it.</v>

3348
02:38:27.961 --> 02:38:32.961
<v Speaker 1>So as Newfoundland and we should go to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the loo while you watch it for like an</v>

3349
02:38:33.850 --> 02:38:35.450
<v Speaker 1>hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you kind of get compelled,</v>

3350
02:38:35.480 --> 02:38:36.710
<v Speaker 1>like who the fuck's gonna win this</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing?</v>

3351
02:38:37.010 --> 02:38:38.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid.</v>

3352
02:38:38.340 --> 02:38:40.520
<v Speaker 1>That's booking gigs was baseball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's do it.</v>

3353
02:38:40.760 --> 02:38:42.360
<v Speaker 1>Let's do Newfoundland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3354
02:38:42.410 --> 02:38:44.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know you're black,</v>

3355
02:38:44.031 --> 02:38:46.130
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This man.</v>

3356
02:38:46.160 --> 02:38:48.560
<v Speaker 1>Just kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's Canada.</v>

3357
02:38:50.220 --> 02:38:53.160
<v Speaker 1>Are they the nicest people on the earth</v>
<v Speaker 1>or is it like Swedish people?</v>

3358
02:38:53.161 --> 02:38:55.460
<v Speaker 1>If you ever been Sweden said that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>met the nicest people.</v>

3359
02:38:55.730 --> 02:38:59.180
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like the same way</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes.</v>

3360
02:38:59.360 --> 02:39:01.440
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's southern hospitality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

3361
02:39:01.450 --> 02:39:05.030
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's southern passive</v>
<v Speaker 1>aggressiveness and they just talk</v>

3362
02:39:05.031 --> 02:39:06.760
<v Speaker 1>horribly behind your back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3363
02:39:06.800 --> 02:39:08.090
<v Speaker 1>And that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um.</v>

3364
02:39:08.930 --> 02:39:11.450
<v Speaker 1>Well I was talking about this with</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody recently that like,</v>

3365
02:39:11.480 --> 02:39:16.480
<v Speaker 1>try to imagine the fact that 18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>65 when slavery was abolished was less</v>

3366
02:39:17.751 --> 02:39:21.110
<v Speaker 1>than 200 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trying to imagine what 200 years is</v>

3367
02:39:21.290 --> 02:39:23.400
<v Speaker 1>because it's only two lifetimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3368
02:39:23.660 --> 02:39:25.760
<v Speaker 1>Two people being alive from birth to</v>
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>

3369
02:39:25.820 --> 02:39:29.300
<v Speaker 1>That's 200 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these people who are very healthy</v>

3370
02:39:29.360 --> 02:39:30.890
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very healthy,</v>

3371
02:39:30.891 --> 02:39:32.070
<v Speaker 1>very lucky people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3372
02:39:32.210 --> 02:39:35.390
<v Speaker 1>so they're stuck in this probably net</v>
<v Speaker 1>slaves,</v>

3373
02:39:36.860 --> 02:39:39.830
<v Speaker 1>slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I live in the beat conditions aren't</v>

3374
02:39:39.831 --> 02:39:41.420
<v Speaker 1>that exact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3375
02:39:41.421 --> 02:39:43.600
<v Speaker 1>You don't have access to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to anything.</v>

3376
02:39:43.610 --> 02:39:48.610
<v Speaker 1>So it doesn't have the gluten free or to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the slave.</v>

3377
02:39:49.700 --> 02:39:51.980
<v Speaker 1>Slaves aren't getting the fresh pressed</v>
<v Speaker 1>juice soda,</v>

3378
02:39:51.981 --> 02:39:52.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

3379
02:39:52.600 --> 02:39:57.010
<v Speaker 1>let's cut it to maybe 60 slash 70.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His foot slaves.</v>

3380
02:39:57.380 --> 02:40:01.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're super lucky and that is only a</v>

3381
02:40:01.671 --> 02:40:06.671
<v Speaker 1>short amount of time ago and no one</v>
<v Speaker 1>understands that today.</v>

3382
02:40:07.370 --> 02:40:08.490
<v Speaker 1>There's no we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

3383
02:40:08.630 --> 02:40:10.970
<v Speaker 1>we can intellectualize it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can think about it,</v>

3384
02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:13.040
<v Speaker 1>we can put it into our heads and try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure it out.</v>

3385
02:40:13.650 --> 02:40:15.270
<v Speaker 1>No one could figure that out today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those,</v>

3386
02:40:15.300 --> 02:40:18.720
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of those areas of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>country that are just poisoned by those</v>

3387
02:40:18.721 --> 02:40:21.000
<v Speaker 1>old stupid ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just stuck in there,</v>

3388
02:40:21.001 --> 02:40:21.834
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3389
02:40:22.710 --> 02:40:25.680
<v Speaker 1>In areas of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of weird areas of the</v>

3390
02:40:25.681 --> 02:40:28.350
<v Speaker 1>world that is poisoned by old stupid</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>

3391
02:40:29.010 --> 02:40:33.240
<v Speaker 1>I um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we should do newfoundland.</v>

3392
02:40:33.390 --> 02:40:34.590
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3393
02:40:34.620 --> 02:40:37.500
<v Speaker 1>I think we just shake off that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Joe Rogan,</v>

3394
02:40:37.590 --> 02:40:38.630
<v Speaker 1>Newfoundland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Newfoundland.</v>

3395
02:40:38.640 --> 02:40:40.560
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's do another one somewhere else.</v>

3396
02:40:40.561 --> 02:40:42.270
<v Speaker 1>Like Saskatchewan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saskatchewan.</v>

3397
02:40:42.360 --> 02:40:45.120
<v Speaker 1>I used to sketch one in January when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>get crazy.</v>

3398
02:40:45.180 --> 02:40:47.910
<v Speaker 1>I met A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I met some Canadian.</v>

3399
02:40:47.940 --> 02:40:50.040
<v Speaker 1>I was in when I was in Minneapolis and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were like,</v>

3400
02:40:50.041 --> 02:40:51.690
<v Speaker 1>you need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they might've been functional.</v>

3401
02:40:51.710 --> 02:40:54.090
<v Speaker 1>Scattered while I didn't even like you</v>
<v Speaker 1>need to cut because they worked,</v>

3402
02:40:54.100 --> 02:40:56.940
<v Speaker 1>but it was some tourism fencing or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

3403
02:40:57.390 --> 02:41:00.300
<v Speaker 1>You need to come to the Saskatchewan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Edmonton.</v>

3404
02:41:00.900 --> 02:41:03.210
<v Speaker 1>I've done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that I'm due to do an Edmonton</v>

3405
02:41:03.211 --> 02:41:06.740
<v Speaker 1>or Calgary on this tour to the river</v>
<v Speaker 1>cree and the Edmonton.</v>

3406
02:41:06.750 --> 02:41:08.550
<v Speaker 1>The casino.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is fantastic.</v>

3407
02:41:08.551 --> 02:41:11.190
<v Speaker 1>That it's fun man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how fun fucking place.</v>

3408
02:41:11.670 --> 02:41:13.020
<v Speaker 1>I like Edmonton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3409
02:41:13.110 --> 02:41:17.460
<v Speaker 1>They're good people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just stuck in some weird spot</v>

3410
02:41:17.461 --> 02:41:20.230
<v Speaker 1>that's like really cold for like four</v>
<v Speaker 1>months of the year.</v>

3411
02:41:20.270 --> 02:41:21.930
<v Speaker 1>But it's money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3412
02:41:21.990 --> 02:41:25.570
<v Speaker 1>It's money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you got these people?</v>

3413
02:41:25.590 --> 02:41:27.120
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes no.</v>

3414
02:41:27.540 --> 02:41:31.140
<v Speaker 1>They just come out of high school and</v>
<v Speaker 1>make six figures.</v>

3415
02:41:31.190 --> 02:41:33.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with their Canadian too.</v>

3416
02:41:33.960 --> 02:41:38.430
<v Speaker 1>There's something about Canadians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like their culture does not support</v>

3417
02:41:38.760 --> 02:41:39.000
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

3418
02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:39.820
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3419
02:41:39.820 --> 02:41:44.820
<v Speaker 1>the world domination idea that United</v>
<v Speaker 1>States sort of has ingrained in us like</v>

3420
02:41:44.911 --> 02:41:46.980
<v Speaker 1>we're the police of the world for good</v>
<v Speaker 1>or for bad.</v>

3421
02:41:47.010 --> 02:41:48.930
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of people think mostly bad</v>

3422
02:41:49.470 --> 02:41:50.290
<v Speaker 1>yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3423
02:41:50.290 --> 02:41:54.840
<v Speaker 1>If the Canadians don't have this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not just trying to create a good</v>

3424
02:41:54.841 --> 02:41:55.780
<v Speaker 1>life for themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3425
02:41:55.890 --> 02:41:59.130
<v Speaker 1>they're just people and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a real value in that.</v>

3426
02:41:59.160 --> 02:42:04.050
<v Speaker 1>But there's also like this idea that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>only way Canada would exist is if the</v>

3427
02:42:04.050 --> 02:42:06.840
<v Speaker 1>United States is below it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tacting it because this is such a</v>

3428
02:42:06.841 --> 02:42:08.540
<v Speaker 1>fucking gangster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3429
02:42:08.930 --> 02:42:12.300
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the idea that I think makes</v>

3430
02:42:12.301 --> 02:42:14.460
<v Speaker 1>total sense if you're looking at it</v>
<v Speaker 1>objectively.</v>

3431
02:42:14.580 --> 02:42:18.270
<v Speaker 1>But goddamn it makes for some Nice folks</v>
<v Speaker 1>because Canada that they're like,</v>

3432
02:42:18.300 --> 02:42:21.030
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe my all time favorite</v>
<v Speaker 1>people anywhere.</v>

3433
02:42:21.540 --> 02:42:26.460
<v Speaker 1>I think that the nicest people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those shows that I was drawing numbers</v>

3434
02:42:26.610 --> 02:42:30.870
<v Speaker 1>in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good spots at 300,</v>

3435
02:42:30.871 --> 02:42:35.871
<v Speaker 1>400 seat spots easily before I was doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>it over here.</v>

3436
02:42:36.690 --> 02:42:38.260
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even Vancouver,</v>

3437
02:42:38.350 --> 02:42:43.350
<v Speaker 1>I remember doing shows in Vancouver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2011 and Toronto played the Horseshoe in</v>

3438
02:42:44.611 --> 02:42:49.611
<v Speaker 1>2011 and then coming through first time</v>
<v Speaker 1>just with like light credits and then</v>

3439
02:42:52.220 --> 02:42:53.670
<v Speaker 1>getting it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

3440
02:42:53.680 --> 02:42:56.760
<v Speaker 1>Then they come in to fuck with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't.</v>

3441
02:42:56.900 --> 02:43:00.790
<v Speaker 1>I first started doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You start hitting some splicing.</v>

3442
02:43:00.900 --> 02:43:02.580
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got people here.</v>

3443
02:43:02.770 --> 02:43:05.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what Canada was when I</v>

3444
02:43:05.970 --> 02:43:08.910
<v Speaker 1>started getting offers to help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking what is.</v>

3445
02:43:09.420 --> 02:43:11.190
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't big money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was just</v>

3446
02:43:11.980 --> 02:43:15.160
<v Speaker 5>to have that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was Vancouver.</v>

3447
02:43:15.700 --> 02:43:18.700
<v Speaker 5>I forget the promoter's name,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I played maybe there.</v>

3448
02:43:18.770 --> 02:43:23.770
<v Speaker 5>Rick Shaw,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a horseshoe tavern in Toronto if five</v>

3449
02:43:24.431 --> 02:43:28.900
<v Speaker 5>years ago and just be as shocked that it</v>
<v Speaker 5>was that many people that it was</v>

3450
02:43:28.901 --> 02:43:29.940
<v Speaker 5>psyched.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was,</v>

3451
02:43:29.941 --> 02:43:31.510
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was just,</v>

3452
02:43:31.570 --> 02:43:33.800
<v Speaker 5>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It happened earlier over there,</v>

3453
02:43:33.801 --> 02:43:34.040
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

3454
02:43:34.040 --> 02:43:36.080
<v Speaker 1>You know you gotta do in Toronto was me</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

3455
02:43:36.340 --> 02:43:38.690
<v Speaker 1>You've got to do the weed shop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>

3456
02:43:38.691 --> 02:43:41.060
<v Speaker 1>We chopped show ever showed it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3457
02:43:41.570 --> 02:43:44.150
<v Speaker 1>They have a front room where they sell</v>
<v Speaker 1>bongs,</v>

3458
02:43:44.780 --> 02:43:47.840
<v Speaker 1>rolling papers and share,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you go in the back room and the</v>

3459
02:43:47.841 --> 02:43:51.740
<v Speaker 1>back room doesn't have any error.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all just pot smoke.</v>

3460
02:43:51.770 --> 02:43:53.540
<v Speaker 1>You're breathing in pot smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no air,</v>

3461
02:43:53.570 --> 02:43:55.270
<v Speaker 1>there's no air left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The light,</v>

3462
02:43:55.520 --> 02:43:57.530
<v Speaker 1>the candles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>candles on the table.</v>

3463
02:43:57.680 --> 02:43:59.780
<v Speaker 1>They're all running on pot smoke and</v>
<v Speaker 1>promises.</v>

3464
02:44:00.140 --> 02:44:01.570
<v Speaker 1>There's no fucking era.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That room,</v>

3465
02:44:01.571 --> 02:44:04.580
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all just pot smoke and you get high</v>

3466
02:44:04.581 --> 02:44:08.090
<v Speaker 1>before you go onstage and then you go on</v>
<v Speaker 1>stage and it's preposterous.</v>

3467
02:44:08.091 --> 02:44:11.010
<v Speaker 1>Everybody in a goddamn coma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is train.</v>

3468
02:44:11.050 --> 02:44:13.610
<v Speaker 1>Just comedy show you've ever done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody wants to have.</v>

3469
02:44:13.611 --> 02:44:15.950
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what you need to do your regular</v>

3470
02:44:15.951 --> 02:44:20.951
<v Speaker 1>show first and then head over to that</v>
<v Speaker 1>place around 12:30 AM.</v>

3471
02:44:21.520 --> 02:44:23.060
<v Speaker 1>He knew what I'm into because I do.</v>

3472
02:44:24.960 --> 02:44:29.130
<v Speaker 5>I like thc capsules.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Me Too,</v>

3473
02:44:29.880 --> 02:44:32.220
<v Speaker 5>and if it's because they met them</v>
<v Speaker 5>because I get.</v>

3474
02:44:32.310 --> 02:44:37.050
<v Speaker 5>I get so weird and in my head sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't unless I'm on,</v>

3475
02:44:37.090 --> 02:44:39.960
<v Speaker 5>unless I'm a little drunk or a little on</v>
<v Speaker 5>something else.</v>

3476
02:44:40.530 --> 02:44:45.530
<v Speaker 5>I'm not able to enjoy myself high a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially if I'm in a situation where a</v>

3477
02:44:46.860 --> 02:44:51.840
<v Speaker 5>recognizable and people recognize if I'm</v>
<v Speaker 5>high on weed and people recognize me,</v>

3478
02:44:52.100 --> 02:44:54.280
<v Speaker 5>you're worried about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get weird.</v>

3479
02:44:54.281 --> 02:44:56.550
<v Speaker 5>It the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's understandable.</v>

3480
02:44:56.580 --> 02:44:58.250
<v Speaker 5>Billows my I will.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

3481
02:44:58.260 --> 02:44:59.580
<v Speaker 5>what am I doing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is life?</v>

3482
02:44:59.581 --> 02:45:01.350
<v Speaker 5>What choose whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's going on?</v>

3483
02:45:01.351 --> 02:45:03.180
<v Speaker 5>What do these people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why are they talking to me?</v>

3484
02:45:03.181 --> 02:45:04.530
<v Speaker 5>Why did I do this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What did I do this?</v>

3485
02:45:04.550 --> 02:45:07.410
<v Speaker 5>Do I just get.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If I'm high,</v>

3486
02:45:08.020 --> 02:45:12.920
<v Speaker 5>I'm gonna have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just can't handle it.</v>

3487
02:45:13.230 --> 02:45:15.100
<v Speaker 1>We need to hang out more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

3488
02:45:15.370 --> 02:45:18.190
<v Speaker 1>Definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't a CIC capsules.</v>

3489
02:45:18.250 --> 02:45:19.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to hold your hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Figurative</v>

3490
02:45:21.830 --> 02:45:24.330
<v Speaker 5>CC capsules.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I took.</v>

3491
02:45:25.090 --> 02:45:30.090
<v Speaker 5>I went to a dispensary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Shout out to native roots in Denver and</v>

3492
02:45:32.330 --> 02:45:36.030
<v Speaker 5>a smooth on that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Also maybe I think I.</v>

3493
02:45:36.180 --> 02:45:40.870
<v Speaker 5>I think maybe the way I smoke,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I shouldn't be out in about smoking is</v>

3494
02:45:40.930 --> 02:45:42.330
<v Speaker 5>a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It should be just chilling,</v>

3495
02:45:43.050 --> 02:45:46.560
<v Speaker 5>watching some shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>playing some video games,</v>

3496
02:45:46.740 --> 02:45:50.900
<v Speaker 5>but my weed smoking never.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just never put it.</v>

3497
02:45:50.910 --> 02:45:55.050
<v Speaker 5>If I can't create a situation with</v>
<v Speaker 5>nobody can talk to me,</v>

3498
02:45:55.460 --> 02:45:58.680
<v Speaker 5>then that's how I need to be high or the</v>
<v Speaker 5>capsules,</v>

3499
02:45:58.710 --> 02:46:00.720
<v Speaker 5>the capsules.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can talk to me a capsule,</v>

3500
02:46:00.721 --> 02:46:05.721
<v Speaker 5>smooth me out and I started taking out</v>
<v Speaker 5>this shit is shit is great and I feel</v>

3501
02:46:07.141 --> 02:46:10.040
<v Speaker 5>good and I feel I can stand up on them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I</v>

3502
02:46:10.040 --> 02:46:14.030
<v Speaker 1>can't do smoke weed and do standup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can take a capsule and behind the</v>

3503
02:46:14.031 --> 02:46:15.500
<v Speaker 1>stand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hm.</v>

3504
02:46:16.630 --> 02:46:18.950
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know the difference between</v>

3505
02:46:19.220 --> 02:46:20.390
<v Speaker 1>eating and smoking it</v>

3506
02:46:21.910 --> 02:46:24.910
<v Speaker 1>slightly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm ready for this is a chemical</v>

3507
02:46:24.911 --> 02:46:26.380
<v Speaker 1>differences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a smell good.</v>

3508
02:46:26.381 --> 02:46:28.240
<v Speaker 1>It's thc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You eat it.</v>

3509
02:46:28.270 --> 02:46:30.580
<v Speaker 1>That would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The compound of the marijuana is</v>

3510
02:46:30.581 --> 02:46:34.510
<v Speaker 1>processed by your liver produces</v>
<v Speaker 1>something called 11 hydroxy metabolite.</v>

3511
02:46:34.640 --> 02:46:36.370
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's way more psychoactive.</v>

3512
02:46:36.371 --> 02:46:39.580
<v Speaker 1>It's like four to five times more</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychoactive than thc.</v>

3513
02:46:39.581 --> 02:46:42.160
<v Speaker 1>So you're talking about the capsules now</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about anytime you eat it,</v>

3514
02:46:42.220 --> 02:46:44.140
<v Speaker 1>eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like edibles.</v>

3515
02:46:44.210 --> 02:46:45.670
<v Speaker 1>If you're taking a capsule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're eating it.</v>

3516
02:46:45.850 --> 02:46:47.590
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it doesn't,</v>

3517
02:46:47.600 --> 02:46:49.150
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like if it's.</v>

3518
02:46:49.330 --> 02:46:52.960
<v Speaker 1>If it goes through your digestive tract</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's processed by your liver,</v>

3519
02:46:52.990 --> 02:46:57.880
<v Speaker 1>takes a little bit about an hour or so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending upon the dosage and how strong</v>

3520
02:46:57.881 --> 02:46:59.070
<v Speaker 1>it is in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3521
02:46:59.150 --> 02:47:00.450
<v Speaker 1>whether you have a full stomach or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

3522
02:47:00.490 --> 02:47:02.620
<v Speaker 1>probably probably has something to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>with it,</v>

3523
02:47:02.950 --> 02:47:06.690
<v Speaker 1>but when it's processed by your liver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it produces this weird psychoed</v>

3524
02:47:07.030 --> 02:47:08.620
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic drug.</v>

3525
02:47:08.800 --> 02:47:12.570
<v Speaker 1>It's very different than just regular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it was a reason.</v>

3526
02:47:12.580 --> 02:47:16.950
<v Speaker 1>The capsules I feel wasteful the than</v>
<v Speaker 1>just swollen somebody's joint.</v>

3527
02:47:17.050 --> 02:47:19.810
<v Speaker 1>Do you know how many milligrams are in</v>
<v Speaker 1>those capsules?</v>

3528
02:47:19.930 --> 02:47:22.600
<v Speaker 1>I think is is 10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3529
02:47:22.601 --> 02:47:25.080
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a really reasonable dose and</v>

3530
02:47:25.090 --> 02:47:29.950
<v Speaker 1>that's the good news about marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like medical marijuana going nationwide</v>

3531
02:47:30.160 --> 02:47:34.180
<v Speaker 1>as you can take a reasonable dose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 milligrams and it's therapeutic for</v>

3532
02:47:34.181 --> 02:47:35.170
<v Speaker 1>your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Feels good.</v>

3533
02:47:35.410 --> 02:47:37.360
<v Speaker 1>You relax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody gets hurt.</v>

3534
02:47:37.800 --> 02:47:39.780
<v Speaker 1>Somebody to explain it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

3535
02:47:39.900 --> 02:47:41.440
<v Speaker 1>What it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I mean.</v>

3536
02:47:41.441 --> 02:47:46.441
<v Speaker 1>I wish I bought way more in Denver and</v>
<v Speaker 1>also if you can just mill,</v>

3537
02:47:46.750 --> 02:47:48.580
<v Speaker 1>I'll see you Monday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll hook you up.</v>

3538
02:47:48.820 --> 02:47:50.520
<v Speaker 1>Relax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't say anymore to give you.</v>

3539
02:47:50.760 --> 02:47:53.820
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get catfished by a cop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bad Cop.</v>

3540
02:47:53.890 --> 02:47:54.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you're going to be fake cops and was</v>

3542
02:47:59.510 --> 02:48:01.370
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this dude's fucking Weirdo was going to</v>

3543
02:48:02.100 --> 02:48:05.410
<v Speaker 1>be a girl with a tiny waist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wastes like my wrist.</v>

3544
02:48:05.440 --> 02:48:07.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't like to do stuff like an</v>

3545
02:48:07.481 --> 02:48:10.530
<v Speaker 1>explosion given people they met awful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just want to fuck.</v>

3546
02:48:10.540 --> 02:48:14.050
<v Speaker 1>They ain't had thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's a good point.</v>

3547
02:48:15.190 --> 02:48:16.570
<v Speaker 1>Good point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's hard.</v>
