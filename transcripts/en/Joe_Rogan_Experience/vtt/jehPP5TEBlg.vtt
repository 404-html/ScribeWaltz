WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.570
It is live right now.
We're doing it already.

2
00:00:03.571 --> 00:00:06.940
I was watching the recording thing was flashing and I get again,

3
00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.430
wasn't recording son of a bitch recording anybody could speak new stream thing.

4
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.850
You fuck you substitution for the expensive,

5
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.160
what is it that uh,
my buddy Justin used?
Yeah.
Tri caster.

6
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:21.780
That's supposed to be the shit.
Yeah,
they're awesome.

7
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.960
The Joe Rogan experience is brought to you by many things in which we love.

8
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.540
I,
one of them is audible.com.
Um,

9
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.210
audible.com is something that I have used for many,
many a moon.

10
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.350
Um,
and uh,
audible occasionally sponsors this podcast.

11
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.210
If you have never been to audible.com what audible.com is,

12
00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.230
is it has a plethora of great like books on tape.

13
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.600
Um,
like people who like Steve Martin,

14
00:00:54.601 --> 00:00:57.390
like read his book and it didn't he read his book on tape.

15
00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.050
<v 1>Yeah.
And he is one of the best ones that I,</v>

16
00:01:00.051 --> 00:01:03.360
I use audible a lot and that's one of my favorite books on tapes ever.

17
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.340
<v 0>Yeah.
Um,
and there's,
there's so many of them,
so many great books there.</v>

18
00:01:07.341 --> 00:01:11.450
They also have the one book that I recommend to people on a regular basis,

19
00:01:11.451 --> 00:01:16.451
which is the war of art for any creative people in creative types who are trying

20
00:01:18.081 --> 00:01:21.740
to overcome procrastination or blocks or w you know what,

21
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.600
this Guy Steven Pressfield calls resistance.
It's a really brilliant,

22
00:01:26.601 --> 00:01:29.000
brilliant book and it is available on tape as well.

23
00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.680
I think that audible books are amazing,
um,
and even better,

24
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.900
um,
then in my opinion than,

25
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.310
than regular books because what I use them for is when I'm stuck doing other

26
00:01:40.311 --> 00:01:42.950
things that do that.
You know,
if you're on a plane,

27
00:01:42.951 --> 00:01:44.360
you're essentially wasting time.

28
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.830
Unless I'm writing on a plane or unless I'm getting actual work done,

29
00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.460
it's a fucking huge waste of time.
But what you can read a,

30
00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.680
an awesome book on a plane and get like an educational experience,

31
00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.480
get an enriching and exciting experience.
Um,
the commute,
same thing,
you know,

32
00:01:59.481 --> 00:02:02.330
and with a beautiful,
beautiful thing about audible is,
you know,

33
00:02:02.331 --> 00:02:05.020
you could download it to your iPod,
you can play it in your car,

34
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.360
you can play it at the gym.
It's a,
it's just an awesome service.

35
00:02:08.361 --> 00:02:11.630
And if you go to audible.com Joe,
um,

36
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.390
I don't know what happens when you got over there.
It's probably better.

37
00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.450

39
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.780

Steve Martin,</v>

43
00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.470
one of the underrated comedians.

44
00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.450
<v 1>I did stand up comedy for 18 years.
10 of those years were spent learning.</v>

45
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.070
Four years were spent refining,
yet that's his voice were spent in wild success.

46
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.040
My most persistent memory of that right here.

47
00:02:49.041 --> 00:02:52.270
I'm going to get a boner and want to hear the whole time.

<v 0>me excited.
Just hearing him.
I fucking love people.</v>

51
00:02:57.281 --> 00:03:00.580
Even when I read that book comedy,
Brian It to me,
Oh,
it's great many years ago,

52
00:03:00.581 --> 00:03:03.190
but hearing him talk about it,
it's better.
It's better than the book.

53
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.910
He talks about the ice house.
He started up here in the ice house,
the ice houses.

54
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.890
Fucking the bomb.
Diggity anyway,

That was my favorite cat.
That creepy cat.
That cat creeps a fuck up.

63
00:03:41.491 --> 00:03:46.210
I mean it's like,
it's like,
it's like playing spot in the copyright violation.

64
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.870
It's sure.
Well,
I'm not down with that,
but the cat is free.
It's a remix.

65
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.100
But the cat's not a remix.
That cat's dope as fuck.
Of course.
Anyway.
Thank you.

66
00:03:57.101 --> 00:04:00.860
Everybody who came out to Toronto,
I saw the dust squad teachers.

67
00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.730
I saw the higher primate tee shirts to the my tee shirt company.

68
00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.490
I never even mentioned,
I'm the worst promoter ever from my own company.

69
00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.670
Hire Dash [inaudible] dot com is my tee shirt company.
If you go there,

70
00:04:09.671 --> 00:04:12.250
it's all tee shirts with monkeys and mushrooms.

71
00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.060
It's monkeys and psychedelic drugs and um,
and I've got more common.

72
00:04:16.061 --> 00:04:19.240
I've got some new ideas.
I'm retarded.
Okay.
There's something wrong with me.

73
00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.960
Obviously.
I'm a grown man with children of my own.

74
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.610
I have a tee shirt company that's about monkeys and drugs.
Um,

75
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.640
we're out of a lot of shots sizes right now,

76
00:04:27.641 --> 00:04:30.700
but we've got new shit coming in and they sell so quick that I don't talk about

77
00:04:30.701 --> 00:04:31.534
this,
how lazy I am.

78
00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.680
I don't talk about them because I don't want to have to replenish my supply and

79
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.400
call people and get work done.
Yeah.
But it's my,
it's,

80
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.650
this is my company a desk.
Squad.
Dot.
TV is Brian's company.
So you,

81
00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.760
when you buy these things,
these are directly supporting us.

82
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.410
I also have a piece of onnit.com on a.com is the company that we've been working

83
00:04:50.411 --> 00:04:53.980
with for years now.
Um,
and selling nutritional supplements.

84
00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.420
And I tell everybody [inaudible] and that's another thing that I've had come up

85
00:04:58.421 --> 00:05:02.620
to me on the road that is just humbling and amazing and inspiring.

86
00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.700
How many people have come up to me and said they've lost a shitload of weight

87
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.590
since they started listening to this podcast.

88
00:05:08.591 --> 00:05:11.410
They think about things differently that they're eating Kale shakes every day.

89
00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.870
I'm a big proponent of nutrition.

90
00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.830
There's a huge difference between the way I feel when I'm eating healthy and

91
00:05:17.831 --> 00:05:18.820
when I feel when I'm not.

92
00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:23.170
Your body needs a bunch of Shit to run good and sciences isolated.

93
00:05:23.171 --> 00:05:25.930
The ones that affect your mind in a very positive way.

94
00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.350
And these are called nootropics and what they essentially do is they help your

95
00:05:29.351 --> 00:05:34.300
brain produce more human neurotransmitters,
makes your brain fire quicker,

96
00:05:34.301 --> 00:05:36.040
and makes your brain you want.
You know,

97
00:05:36.041 --> 00:05:38.020
the of days when you just feel fucking shitty.

98
00:05:38.021 --> 00:05:40.780
We can't come up with names and you're,
you're scrambling.

99
00:05:40.781 --> 00:05:44.870
You and your brain's like firing bad.
Just like the,

100
00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.080
they're not coming out.
Even like a normal word.

101
00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:50.270
Alpha brain prevents all that shit for me.
Uh,

102
00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.290
it doesn't work for everybody if you're fucking smoking cigarettes and not

103
00:05:53.291 --> 00:05:55.420
taking care of yourself.
I don't know how much it's going to affect you,

104
00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.040
but it's like for me,
it has a big on an old 46

105
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.240
<v 2>tower for me.
Yeah.
For me it has a big effect.
I've,
I fucking love this stuff.</v>

106
00:06:02.241 --> 00:06:04.670
I take it every day.
I also take shroom tech sport.

107
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.740
It's a quarter [inaudible] mushroom supplement that we sell,

108
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.210
which cordyceps mushroom has been showed to aid your,

109
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.760
your body's ability to process oxygen and it gives people more endurance.

110
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.940
It was sort of discovered by a high altitude herders.

111
00:06:16.941 --> 00:06:19.430
They found that their cows were eating these mushrooms and they had more

112
00:06:19.431 --> 00:06:20.930
activities so people started eating them.

113
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:25.820
And it's some crazy cryptic process where you have to grow this mold on the back

114
00:06:25.821 --> 00:06:30.040
of a fucking caterpillar.
It's really,
yeah,
it's fucking crazy.

115
00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:34.580
Like Google it or go to [inaudible] dot com all the questions to all the

116
00:06:34.581 --> 00:06:35.414
important,

117
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.000
all the answers rather to the important questions that I'm sure you have if

118
00:06:38.001 --> 00:06:41.330
you're smart,
which all these questions cannot be answered by a more on my,

119
00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.740
by myself.
When I tell you all these things about like human neuro transmitters,

120
00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:46.970
I don't really know what I'm saying.
I'm just sort of repeating.

121
00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:51.620
You've read a pdf.
I've read exactly what it was.
Yeah,
I know what that says,

122
00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:55.390
but I don't know.
Like really you can regurgitate paragraph three.
It sounds,

123
00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:59.950
I can sound smart as fuck son,
but if you told me to spot,
you know like,

124
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:03.590
okay,
and the neurotransmitters do what exactly.
I'd be like,
well,

125
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:08.560
they'll make you fucking awesome.
I know that on a tee shirt with some monkeys.

126
00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:12.080
Yeah.
I don't have any answers to those questions.
Uh,

127
00:07:12.081 --> 00:07:14.570
we also sell kettle bells and battle ropes.

128
00:07:14.571 --> 00:07:19.190

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:55.590
The kettlebells are there,
Troy kettle bells.

142
00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:59.420
They're the very best kettlebells available.
Battle ropes,
the very best develop.

143
00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:01.220
Most of it is the cheapest we can sell it.

144
00:08:01.221 --> 00:08:03.200
The battle ropes are the cheapest you can find on the Internet.

145
00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:05.510
The kettle bells are right up there.

146
00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:08.510
There's literally as low as we can price them without losing money.
Selling them.

147
00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:12.440
So this is all like super high end stuff and if you use a code name Rogan,

148
00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:14.870
you will save 10% off any and all supplements.

149
00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.830
That sounds like a real commercial.
It's so boring.

150
00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:20.030
I want like you need an 80 style number how they used to sell action figures and

151
00:08:20.031 --> 00:08:22.930
the 80s with kids busting through like foam brick walls and shit like that.

152
00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:26.530
You need some like that for battle ropes,
ropes

153
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.240
and take you down with my battle real Jimmy and then ended,

154
00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:32.780
there's a smoke machine that fires up.

155
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:36.220
We need like an old commercial like one of those atlas commercials where he was

156
00:08:36.221 --> 00:08:39.170
on the beach and someone kicked sand in his face and he was like you mother

157
00:08:39.171 --> 00:08:41.300
fucker.
And he picks up the ropes and you see his muscles.

158
00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:49.010
Well when you think about the movements of battle ropes,

159
00:08:49.011 --> 00:08:50.570
it's totally like chimpanzee movements.

160
00:08:50.571 --> 00:08:53.220
When they're beating the shit out something or they were clubbing a bride is

161
00:08:53.221 --> 00:08:56.100
dragged back to the case.
It's definitely primer.

162
00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:01.140
<v 3>It's good for hammer fist to boom.
Kevin Prayer has here you dirty bitches,</v>

163
00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:05.930
hold the fuck up kid.
Strap yourself in the launch.

164
00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:11.360
I'm in the refractory period.
I need ice.

165
00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:19.140
Oh Shit.
All Day.
All night.
All Day

166
00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:24.170
controversy all over the world.
Kevin.

167
00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:29.120
Mother fucking Perreira is here.
Bitches respect.
Ah,

168
00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:32.250
so nice to see you again,
my friend.
Good to see you as well.
So you uh,

169
00:09:32.251 --> 00:09:34.680
you will have a abandon your spot on television.

170
00:09:34.681 --> 00:09:37.770
Like a real g stepped out into the real world,
man.

171
00:09:37.771 --> 00:09:41.010
That takes balls the cord and slam through the get glass canopy.

172
00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:41.970
For folks who don't know,

173
00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:47.070
Kevin was the host of a attack of the show on g four for it.
Jesus.

174
00:09:47.071 --> 00:09:51.830
How many years?
God,
God is with the network for 10 years.
And I hosted attack,
uh,

175
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:54.420
for six.
When did I first do your show?
What year was it?

176
00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:57.060
We were probably two or three years into it.

177
00:09:57.061 --> 00:10:01.500
So 2007 or something like give or take seven or eight.
Yeah,
it was.

178
00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.180
And we've been friends ever since.

179
00:10:03.181 --> 00:10:05.460
And Kevin's on the podcast stuff several times.

180
00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:09.000
We went to things remembered after the first show and we got one of those little

181
00:10:09.001 --> 00:10:10.080
heartbreak necklaces.

182
00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:14.610
Mine has bee on it and Fri and you have the other letters and sounds together we

183
00:10:14.611 --> 00:10:18.660
summon a very sexual captain planet.
Make Brian Jealous Right now.
Brian.

184
00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:22.260
Brian has the Arrow that goes through the heart right to the knee.

185
00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:25.950
Write anything into three ways.
The mail in which one's the females,
the male,

186
00:10:25.951 --> 00:10:29.640
the Arrow that goes to the heart.
You know when the circle nose,

187
00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:34.500
those two circles at the bottom to represent testicles or really it should.

188
00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:38.970
I should
write your own Google.

189
00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:44.170
I'm fucking the wicked.
He sure I got the answers to this bitch.
Yeah,
man,

190
00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.410
totally should.
Right.
It should look like a dick.
Why?

191
00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:50.730
Why does it have to be like why didn't show the symbol for mail and assign those

192
00:10:50.731 --> 00:10:53.660
things?
It was probably someone who really couldn't draw that well.
So we set out,

193
00:10:53.661 --> 00:10:56.250
here's a stick with a loop and now we call it the mail it.

194
00:10:56.251 --> 00:10:59.280
But it was a dude who designed princess thing when he stopped being a person.

195
00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.480
See,
same company.
I think that was illegal thing though.

196
00:11:03.481 --> 00:11:07.180
I think that was one of those record companies fucking you over things.
Well,

197
00:11:07.181 --> 00:11:08.370
I'll tell you what.
If you just have a symbol,

198
00:11:08.371 --> 00:11:10.950
your music is fucking hard to torrent.
Yeah.

199
00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:14.580
If you're just like alt j uses a triangle and thankfully you can type in all j,

200
00:11:14.581 --> 00:11:15.690
but if you try to just try it,

201
00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:18.810
if you just have to type the triangle that requires extended ASCII knowledge.

202
00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:22.530
My Dad's not going to pirate that album.
Wait Yard.
Yeah.
How would you draw?

203
00:11:22.531 --> 00:11:23.730
That's that prince symbol.

204
00:11:23.731 --> 00:11:26.640
You would have to get a font made up and then someone would have to agree to

205
00:11:26.641 --> 00:11:29.970
assign a key to that font and the op.
The [inaudible] would have to be changed.

206
00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:35.280
Right?
I O s 6.5 that we'll have the Emoji and prince icon set.

207
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:37.890
Don't think it's necessary.
I think he's Prince again.

208
00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.550
What do you think contra to went over that I think is,

209
00:11:41.551 --> 00:11:44.380
what are you doing over there?
The old street,
serious money.

210
00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:48.090
I went on to the old reports show.
That was wild.
[inaudible] was awesome,
man.

211
00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:49.230
I used to love that show.

212
00:11:49.231 --> 00:11:51.660
My wife would get so mad at me for watching that stupid show.

213
00:11:51.661 --> 00:11:54.390
Which one did you watch?
Screen savers or cry help like screensavers

214
00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:58.420
<v 1>this is so boring.
Well,
that was the thing,
like it was a whole,
I've loved it.</v>

215
00:11:58.421 --> 00:12:02.080
I was a super fan of Tech TV and Leo's and everything they did,
but it's wild.

216
00:12:02.081 --> 00:12:05.080
The notion that on television where they're trying to reach a very broad

217
00:12:05.081 --> 00:12:05.914
audience,

218
00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:09.880
there was an hour or sometimes five hour marathon long show of like you got a

219
00:12:09.881 --> 00:12:14.320
problem with your printer driver.
Okay,
what model HPD you have?
All right,

220
00:12:14.321 --> 00:12:17.950
let's check some dll files scrolling.
I'm like,
what?
Talk about narrow casting.

221
00:12:17.951 --> 00:12:21.490
There's been 30 minutes helping one person with their fucking printer drivers

222
00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:23.860
and I loved it.
It was awesome.
I learned so much.

223
00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:26.773
<v 2>I think we,</v>

224
00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:30.110
I think we underestimate people's attention spans for these type of things.

225
00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:34.640
I really do.
I think people are very curious about those kind of,

226
00:12:34.641 --> 00:12:35.900
and some folks are,
look,

227
00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:40.070
there was a UFC this weekend or these guys fought that for the flyweight title

228
00:12:40.071 --> 00:12:45.070
and it's a fucking amazing fight between Joseph Benevidez and this guy,

229
00:12:45.071 --> 00:12:48.800
Demetrius money mouse Johnson who won when and decision and the crowd was
booing.

230
00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:52.850
They were booing because nothing they,
these guys were fucking throwing down.

231
00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:56.030
I mean it was a want to see the big power shots and that they want to see

232
00:12:56.031 --> 00:13:00.320
someone getting knocked unconscious.
It was,
it was so gross.
It was just so,

233
00:13:00.321 --> 00:13:02.930
such a plethora of dummies.
It was so hard.

234
00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.180
So it's like you're never going to get away from that.

235
00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:07.850
Well not always going to have a certain percentage.
People are,

236
00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:09.500
you can train people

237
00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:13.120
<v 1>to have certain viewing habits and expectations and that's what like the Google</v>

238
00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.050
Youtube channels that came out.

239
00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:18.430
Some people are doing 30 40 minute long shows on youtube that are actually doing

240
00:13:18.431 --> 00:13:22.060
pretty well.
And that kind of behavior a year ago was unheard of.

241
00:13:22.061 --> 00:13:25.960
The notion that someone would stare at this to stream video for an hour or half

242
00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:27.370
hour to watch a web show was unheard of.

243
00:13:27.371 --> 00:13:31.420
So people can be trained to have different expectations of running times in

244
00:13:31.421 --> 00:13:34.360
length.
So you can,
you can manipulate attention

245
00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:37.140
<v 2>spans essentially.
You can,
it can be done.
Yes.
Well sir,</v>

246
00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:39.210
I don't think it's really manipulating attention spans.

247
00:13:39.211 --> 00:13:41.820
I think we're underestimating people's interests in things.

248
00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:43.590
When we started doing the podcast,

249
00:13:43.591 --> 00:13:47.160
everybody told Brian and I that we had to shorten it.
Yeah,
couldn't agree more.

250
00:13:47.161 --> 00:13:50.150
You have these long ass conversation remind you got short hair.

251
00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:54.750
I stood up and I was like,
there's no way I go.
I don't get it.

252
00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:57.360
Just a conversation.
If you don't like it,
you shut it off.

253
00:13:57.450 --> 00:13:59.580
If you don't have any more time left to shut it off.

254
00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:03.930
Like there's no obligation to continue with this conversation.
But I want,

255
00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:07.370
I like conversations that I have with my friends when we're,

256
00:14:07.371 --> 00:14:11.220
we're up for a couple hours smoking pot or something like that and we have these

257
00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:13.950
really intense moments where you know,

258
00:14:13.951 --> 00:14:18.420
I'm being aided by his intellect and he's introducing thoughts.
To my mind,

259
00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:22.830
this is a real like regeneration and refreshing of the mind when you have these

260
00:14:22.831 --> 00:14:24.270
kind of conversations.
You know,

261
00:14:24.271 --> 00:14:29.271
even if you're just talking stone shit about simulation theory and and you know,

262
00:14:29.581 --> 00:14:32.220
and whether or not mushrooms really are a portal to another dimension.

263
00:14:32.221 --> 00:14:33.240
Just stupid shit.

264
00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:37.550
<v 1>The shit that comes out at hour two and a half around that mark is when you get</v>

265
00:14:37.551 --> 00:14:37.671
there,

266
00:14:37.671 --> 00:14:40.700
which is why you'll never see those kind of conversations on a late night talk

267
00:14:40.701 --> 00:14:42.990
show where you have three and a half minutes plug your movie,

268
00:14:42.991 --> 00:14:44.270
you get to the clip,
get out and go.

269
00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:49.370
<v 2>People don't realize the fun and just shooting the shit with cool people and</v>

270
00:14:49.981 --> 00:14:51.920
that's when you,
when someone said that

271
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:54.200
<v 0>there were too long,
I'm like,
you're crazy.</v>

272
00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:57.440
But you could say just because everybody else is doing an hour doesn't mean it

273
00:14:57.441 --> 00:14:58.880
has to be an hour.
That's nuts.

274
00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:03.020
Giving them too much is way better than not giving them enough like the I,

275
00:15:03.021 --> 00:15:06.680
the idea is to just put out the best shit you could put out and if you could

276
00:15:06.681 --> 00:15:09.860
keep going for after two hours,
why wouldn't you keep going?

277
00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:11.870
I could see this is what you're trying to do,
right?

278
00:15:11.871 --> 00:15:15.020
You're trying to try to tune people into this real conversation.

279
00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:18.490
<v 3>It's kind of one of the reasons that I actually ended up having to leave attack.</v>

280
00:15:18.491 --> 00:15:19.720
I mean,
there were a myriad reasons,

281
00:15:19.721 --> 00:15:22.450
but one of those things was I was getting a chance to meet so many fascinating

282
00:15:22.451 --> 00:15:26.050
people who I was passionate about and wanted to talk with and I was given four

283
00:15:26.051 --> 00:15:29.350
minutes live with them and it's my first time saying,
hello,

284
00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:33.810
<v 0>you need a podcast in the works,
the works in the world.
Dude,</v>

285
00:15:33.811 --> 00:15:36.120
you need to do on tonight.
Right after this podcast,

286
00:15:36.121 --> 00:15:39.060
I'll be your first guest on your pod.
This isn't me tugging off strangers.

287
00:15:39.061 --> 00:15:42.390
This is me spinning plates.
All right,
I got,
I know a couple in the error,

288
00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:43.293
I'm sure,

289
00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:47.490
but what I'm saying is your gift is that you're an intelligent,

290
00:15:47.491 --> 00:15:49.860
curious guy and when one of your gifts,
obviously we're brilliant.

291
00:15:49.861 --> 00:15:54.070
Talk about my eyes.
I love your face too.
You have great bone structure.
Apple.

292
00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:58.500
I'm not man.
I'm saying that there's lost.
I'm lost already.

293
00:15:58.501 --> 00:16:00.320
I was lost before I got here.
There's,

294
00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:05.350
there's no better expression for or portal for expression for you then a than an

295
00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:08.640
a podcast where you can control,

296
00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:10.620
especially something like this where you can add video,

297
00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:12.480
essentially do whatever we want.

298
00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:17.370
It's so close to a real television show except it's not.

299
00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:18.660
There's no ads ever.

300
00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:22.200
And those ads in the beginning and then the whole fucking thing runs for three

301
00:16:22.201 --> 00:16:24.230
hours.
Yes.
People still complain.

302
00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:27.320
<v 3>You pretty much do that already though.
You did stick cam last night for an hour.</v>

303
00:16:27.321 --> 00:16:29.760
You randomly,
I'll hop on and like if I'm going to drum,

304
00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:33.060
I'll live casts some of my,
my drumming,
but then it always ends up with meat,

305
00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:37.620
sweaty and having an emotional outpour and then the strangers.
Oh,
I did.

306
00:16:37.621 --> 00:16:39.390
I will press the hand up against the Webcam.

307
00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:43.460
It looks like it is a Portuguese hedgehog.
Just mashed against the Lens.

308
00:16:43.461 --> 00:16:48.060
This girls right now going through your recorded youtube Ustream and there's

309
00:16:48.061 --> 00:16:51.600
videos trying to find it primarily 18 to 34 year old males going through that

310
00:16:51.601 --> 00:16:55.660
youth street trying to find it.
You more of like a gay crush?
Yeah,
I'm,

311
00:16:55.661 --> 00:16:57.690
why am I a twink or a bear?
How does that work?

312
00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:59.460
I think you just probably have assembled like coffee,

313
00:16:59.461 --> 00:17:01.680
like this handsome young guys.

314
00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:06.640
It looks like you could be easily overpowered.
Hmm.
That's what it is.
Sexual,

315
00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:10.050
I wouldn't even fight.
I would scrap if that turns you on.
That's about it.

316
00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:13.140
I parked your face and I thought it would make you harder,

317
00:17:13.141 --> 00:17:17.070
but just that that alone,
that sentence is really disturbing.

318
00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:19.710
I might fight if it makes you,

319
00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:23.280
Brian and I were having a conversation before we went live of like girls that

320
00:17:23.281 --> 00:17:27.600
request and demand that you strike them during the act and I've been with one

321
00:17:27.601 --> 00:17:28.920
and it was insane and I couldn't,

322
00:17:28.921 --> 00:17:32.900
I couldn't do it more than more than five or 10 sessions.
Yeah.

323
00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:36.600
I've never had a girl asking me to hit her,

324
00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:41.450
but I have had girls ask me to rape them.
That's even worse.
That's kind of,

325
00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:44.580
yeah,
like I've had girls me off.
Oh,

326
00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:47.430
they want you to look like she explained it to me that she wanted,

327
00:17:47.431 --> 00:17:50.040
she wanted me to rape her and she wanted to me off and I was like,
I feel

328
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:51.570
<v 1>like that sentence,
it's followed with your honor.</v>

329
00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:58.020
<v 4>She was asking for it.
We were in an alley.
Let me break my nails.</v>

330
00:17:58.070 --> 00:18:01.100
<v 1>It gets the concrete never wound up doing right.
I should just clarify.</v>

331
00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:04.070
I just thought it was the craziest thing I'd ever heard in my life.
I don't know.

332
00:18:04.071 --> 00:18:06.740
It's like,
look,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm into living with reality.

333
00:18:06.741 --> 00:18:10.280
I don't know what you're trying to,
I'm not barely,
you know,

334
00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:12.790
we don't have been dating a little while.
We didn't need any fantasies yet.

335
00:18:12.791 --> 00:18:16.430
Like Jesus fucking Christ.
Like how about a regular sex life is going stale.

336
00:18:16.431 --> 00:18:19.520
How about a rape fantasy?
You really are who I really am.

337
00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:23.660
Both horny thrown into a van and hit me with a two by four and then stream it.

338
00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:27.410
No.
So she wanted to fight me off.
It was this weird thing.
She's like,

339
00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:31.520
but you know that it's not so,
it's okay.
I go,
it's not because it's still,

340
00:18:31.521 --> 00:18:36.410
I'm still gonna do it.
Like in,
you know,
I don't want to do that.
It's just,

341
00:18:36.411 --> 00:18:41.360
I don't,
I don't want to associate like physical aggression with sexuality.

342
00:18:41.361 --> 00:18:44.120
It's just,
it's tough because this isn't my story to really tell.

343
00:18:44.121 --> 00:18:46.430
And I have a very close knit group of friends,

344
00:18:46.431 --> 00:18:50.970
but someone in that group whose name rhymes with mom,
no,

345
00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:54.530
no.
What's his name?
Come on,
give up.
Here's the thing.
Here's the thing.
No,
no,
no.

346
00:18:54.531 --> 00:18:55.430
This is,
it's a brilliant story.

347
00:18:55.431 --> 00:18:58.910
He started dating and it give them a fake name in a cliff notes this year.
Okay.

348
00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:03.970
My Buddy Dale Dale started to date a woman Shariece Shariece told Dale it was

349
00:19:05.811 --> 00:19:08.540
always a fantasy,
is fantasy of hers to be raped.

350
00:19:08.541 --> 00:19:10.820
But it's sort of one of those things where you can't ask to be raped because

351
00:19:10.821 --> 00:19:13.220
then you know,
and it would ruin the fantasy.
You just always want it.

352
00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:16.640
So after they'd been dating for no less than a year,

353
00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:19.760
and they were both into kinky sex and weird sex circles and kind of went around

354
00:19:19.761 --> 00:19:20.840
in those Kevin Roads.

355
00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:23.670
<v 4>I'm not gonna,
I'm not gonna say yes,</v>

356
00:19:23.671 --> 00:19:25.440
but I'm going to tap my nose and wink can point your way.

357
00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:28.560
So my buddy Kevin was like,

358
00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:35.200
oh my God,
tea kettle bells.
So

359
00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:39.150
<v 1>less than a year they'd been dating.
He arranges,
she's flying in from town.
He,</v>

360
00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:44.210
he arranges for three giant dudes to pick her up at the airport,

361
00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:46.770
take her away,
throw rent a van,

362
00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:50.460
pretty much run a train on her outside of gas station.
She's crying,

363
00:19:50.461 --> 00:19:54.520
thinks the real thing has happened.
Then he shows up and uh,

364
00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:59.690
he says happy birthday and she cried and thanked him and couldn't believe it.

365
00:20:00.061 --> 00:20:04.920
There's still the to this day.
Wow.
Yup.
That's the first time I met Kevin Rose.

366
00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:08.850
I was invited to run a train on his girlfriend.
Whoa.
I had no idea.
Sara Lane.

367
00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:12.770
And you were still dating house?
Absolutely not.

368
00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:16.340
Absolutely not him whatsoever.
That is the namesake.

369
00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:19.650
Why does it show up for tests?
This is all just a joke.
No one.

370
00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:24.330
But that's a crazy story,
man.
That's one up story.
And she liked it.
She liked,

371
00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:26.750
and so that's when I go like immediately I go,
well,
you know what?

372
00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:30.540
I want to be clear as well.
That's not for me.
Not necessarily for me.
All right.

373
00:20:30.541 --> 00:20:33.510
I have a rape fantasy and I would love for three dudes to run a train on me.

374
00:20:33.511 --> 00:20:37.770
Sure.
I get that right.
So not for me,
but on the other hand,

375
00:20:37.771 --> 00:20:42.420
on the flip side of that coin,
that's fucking love.
Like at some point you go,

376
00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:45.570
what were the odds of those two ships passing in the night?
One,

377
00:20:45.571 --> 00:20:48.400
having a rape fantasy,
the other be willing to fulfill

378
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:52.990
<v 3>it in that capacity and go for it and then say happy birthday and say happy</v>

379
00:20:52.991 --> 00:20:56.710
birthday.
That might be the craziest story.
The cake is on your face.

380
00:20:57.130 --> 00:21:00.010
Craziest story I've ever heard about a man and a woman together.

381
00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:00.963
Pretty fantastic.

382
00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:04.450
People's trying to think of it is that they could see Adam's get to know this

383
00:21:04.451 --> 00:21:08.200
isn't,
this isn't,
this is nobody that it's in any sort of limelight.

384
00:21:08.201 --> 00:21:10.990
They don't have Wikipedia.
It's really fucked up that some,

385
00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:15.400
you know that there's these variables because it would be nice if rape was

386
00:21:15.401 --> 00:21:17.140
always bad.
You know,

387
00:21:17.141 --> 00:21:20.470
it would be nice if girls did not ever have a rape fantasy,

388
00:21:20.471 --> 00:21:23.710
so there couldn't be any weirdness.
I can't remember which comedian is,

389
00:21:23.711 --> 00:21:26.890
I might've been Louis C K that had a bit about when a girl says no and she's

390
00:21:26.891 --> 00:21:30.310
like,
why didn't you go for it?
Cause you said no.
Yeah,
but it meant no playfully.

391
00:21:30.311 --> 00:21:33.420
It's like I'm not going to have sex with you on the off chance that you're into

392
00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:35.350
that.
You know what I mean?
There's no,

393
00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:40.750
no should really mean no and yes can problem is.
That's not what she wants.

394
00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:43.270
She really wants you to take it,

395
00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:47.860
which is crazy because for a woman who doesn't want that,
it's a horrific idea.

396
00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:50.320
I always,
I always apologize after and I have a hump.

397
00:21:50.321 --> 00:21:52.390
They hallmark needs to make cards for that.
Like,
sorry,

398
00:21:52.391 --> 00:21:55.600
you didn't want to be forcibly sext.
Yeah.
This girl,

399
00:21:56.050 --> 00:22:00.580
this girl call an Uber for you dated that wanted me to rape her.
She got over it.

400
00:22:00.581 --> 00:22:03.670
She only asked for it once,
but it was really weird.

401
00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:08.250
Was that rooted in something else?
I don't see a victim of a sex crime earlier.

402
00:22:08.251 --> 00:22:12.640
I was like,
no.
She is like,
she likes super aggression.

403
00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:17.570
She liked aggression,
like she just battle rope movements on your face and bash.

404
00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:22.420
You wanted some fucking drunk.
She was just a wild pitch.
I don't know.

405
00:22:22.421 --> 00:22:26.590
I don't know what I'll have her contact.
No,
this was many minutes on Facebook.

406
00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:29.530
I don't think you can find if I battle rope.
Thank you.
Should not.

407
00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:34.120
She might ruined.
I was so tiny.
I would snap in half at the thought.
Plus,

408
00:22:34.121 --> 00:22:37.330
she's got to be like 40 now so it's over that.
So I don't mind.

409
00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:41.480
I don't mind when the tread on the tires is worn off.
I'll hop in there.
The rim,

410
00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:43.240
it depends when you say it's over,

411
00:22:43.241 --> 00:22:47.200
but I saw Cindy Crawford who was like almost 50 or she might be 50 and she is

412
00:22:47.201 --> 00:22:50.440
still so hot as fuck.
What about Gwen's Tiffani?

413
00:22:50.441 --> 00:22:52.180
Isn't she like 40 something now and I don't know.

414
00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:54.460
I just saw in the at the airport on the cover of some magazine and I'm like,

415
00:22:54.461 --> 00:22:57.520
I would absolutely toss it and they're not going to ever have a chance.

416
00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:59.800
But say that though,
based on a magazine cover,

417
00:22:59.801 --> 00:23:03.070
cause that might as well be like a werewolf.
I get,
I get that there's,

418
00:23:03.071 --> 00:23:06.730
there's Photoshop and camera trickery and get at that goes on.

419
00:23:06.731 --> 00:23:09.960
You seen those photos of Madonna,
Riesling,
a skeletor.
Yeah.

420
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.210
But then you see her in other promotional pictures and she looks hot still.

421
00:23:13.211 --> 00:23:17.830
It's like,
what's going on?
Who's lying to me?
Someone's lying boners confused.

422
00:23:17.890 --> 00:23:20.910
I'm fucking really creeped out by this.
Like that.

423
00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:22.570
There must be a phantom of the opera.
Would you,

424
00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:25.760
would you bang Madonna knowing fuck really looks like not even born.

425
00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:29.410
I'm not into that story of it and none of that.
I get a tagger ear and monitor.

426
00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:33.260
When I was 17 I was in love with her really big thing for her.

427
00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:38.730
You loved her music.
I love that movie.
Um,
the,
the fission Mitosis,
vision quest,

428
00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:42.490
she played a,
she sang a song and vision quest and it was like,

429
00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:46.100
she had a couple songs on the soundtrack and the soundtrack was what I would

430
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:49.220
<v 2>use to train with.
I would always train to the vision quest soundtrack.</v>

431
00:23:49.221 --> 00:23:51.410
I had a Walkman cassette Walkman dude,

432
00:23:51.411 --> 00:23:55.190
old school and when I would do my sprints I would listen to that.

433
00:23:55.191 --> 00:23:58.040
So I had this like weird crush on her because of that.

434
00:23:58.041 --> 00:24:01.130
So awkwardly fast forward the cassette to get to the crescendo of the song

435
00:24:01.131 --> 00:24:04.060
before a sprint.
No,
I wasn't.
So I want to believe you.

436
00:24:04.061 --> 00:24:06.800
It was difficult back then because back then it was like,

437
00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:15.140
it was,
it was like this is not so easy.
Yeah.
You rarely didn't queue things up.

438
00:24:15.141 --> 00:24:17.840
I would cue up the beginning of the song right before a sprint.

439
00:24:17.841 --> 00:24:19.800
Maybe you did go through,

440
00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:23.090
but it's suck because of the fucking cassette thing was too big.

441
00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:27.290
So it's slapping against your other hard plastic slapped against you.

442
00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:30.590
That's how fetishes are born.
I was in a Madonna back then,

443
00:24:30.591 --> 00:24:34.310
which is really funny because I was 17 and then I found out she was 26 I was

444
00:24:34.311 --> 00:24:36.290
like,
damn that bitch,
it's old.
That's all.

445
00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:45.080
I'm 45 now.
I'm fucking practically dead.
That's ridiculous.

446
00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:50.210
We don't want to feel great,
but uh,

447
00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:52.340
I've just never been into the Madonna type.

448
00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:55.550
I never been into like super aggressive business and they took a flex break.

449
00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:59.800
You're not going to put a podcast on hold and then he's going to hit it.
Right?

450
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:04.790
I'd fuck me.
Anybody else?
Let me raped me.
Joe,

451
00:25:04.791 --> 00:25:08.960
take me out behind the name.
Come on.
I won't bear Macy.
I promise.
Flexing.

452
00:25:08.961 --> 00:25:13.040
I broke loose and eyelash and a felony level.
Oh,
I hate that.
She will.

453
00:25:13.041 --> 00:25:14.930
I will go ahead and put a key between my fingers,

454
00:25:14.931 --> 00:25:16.790
but I'm not going to jab you with it.
Just come and take me.

455
00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:21.560
What a shitty design our eyes are that occasionally the rafters fall off into it

456
00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:25.840
and then you can't see like what if a fucking a bear was trying to get you an

457
00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:29.580
eyelash felony awry like mother Fucker,
hold on,
hold on,
hold on.

458
00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:30.860
We're going to devolve very soon.

459
00:25:30.861 --> 00:25:34.130
We're going to be become so reliant on plastic chips in our bodies and

460
00:25:34.131 --> 00:25:36.650
technology to regulate us at.
The body's just going to stop.
They're like,

461
00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:39.380
we don't really need eyes anymore.
We'll figure that out with thermal.
I disagree.

462
00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:44.210
I think it,
I think it's going to be augmented in assimilation course.
Yeah.

463
00:25:44.211 --> 00:25:47.180
We're still going to have some sort of a reading type thing going on.
Look,

464
00:25:47.181 --> 00:25:51.170
eventually we are going to be those gray aliens.
There's no way around it.

465
00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:53.510
If you look,
it'll be [inaudible] drives.

466
00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:57.260
We were at the Santa Barbara Zoo the other day and got to check some gorillas

467
00:25:57.261 --> 00:26:01.490
out.
Oh,
it's fucking beautiful.
Santa Barbara is amazing zoo there.

468
00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:04.040
I've been going there with my family.
I love,
I love Santa Barbara.

469
00:26:04.041 --> 00:26:07.400
It's a gorgeous community.
It's,
it's amazing.
Nice little restaurants,

470
00:26:07.401 --> 00:26:08.630
beautiful neighborhoods.

471
00:26:08.631 --> 00:26:11.630
Beautiful view that the weather's amazing and they got this cool zoo,

472
00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:14.720
but all zoos bummed me out.
If I didn't have children,

473
00:26:14.721 --> 00:26:17.180
I would never go to the zoo because I hate the idea of,

474
00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:18.680
I don't mind the idea of hunting.

475
00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:21.140
I think the hunting is the way people were supposed to live,

476
00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:22.700
but depends on how you're hunting as well.

477
00:26:22.701 --> 00:26:27.430
If you're paying for 5,000 birds to be released so you can shoot a gun.

478
00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:30.450
Yeah,
not really hunting asshole.
That was,

479
00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:33.630
that's a weird thing they do with old rich dudes.
They just give them a shirt,

480
00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:38.660
bang or bring you out in a range rover and put you within three meters of an

481
00:26:38.661 --> 00:26:39.291
elephant in hand.

482
00:26:39.291 --> 00:26:42.020
You a rifle and he's pointed anywhere in his general direction and pull the

483
00:26:42.021 --> 00:26:45.000
trigger and I'll get a of you with a foot on it.
That's not hunting.

484
00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:49.490
Not necessarily what I mean,
but what a,
I get what you're saying is,
yeah,

485
00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:53.190
what bums me out is animal person,
animal prisons bum me out.

486
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:56.670
Way more than hunting because at least if you're hunting an animal,

487
00:26:56.790 --> 00:26:58.290
even if you're not going to eat that animal,

488
00:26:58.291 --> 00:27:00.870
if you're going to just give that animal away,
which is kind of weird.

489
00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:03.240
Like this Guy Matt Hughes,
a UFC champion,

490
00:27:03.241 --> 00:27:05.190
just got in trouble with a lot of people.

491
00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:08.790
People are angry at him because he went to South Africa and shot everything.

492
00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:11.400
She did one of those things including women and children,

493
00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:15.360
Zebra and a bunch of different animals and,
but even that,

494
00:27:15.361 --> 00:27:19.860
to me it's like that still seems to be better than the fucking zoo.

495
00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:23.930
I think the zoo is one of the,
like the,
the the,

496
00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:26.070
if you want to talk about cruelty to animals,

497
00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:30.600
the zoo is one of the most fucked up places on earth because those animals are

498
00:27:30.601 --> 00:27:34.800
denied all of their natural activities.
All of them.

499
00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:39.720
We think that just because they have food there,
okay,
that is madness.
Or Hey,

500
00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:42.930
well,
you know what?
Their forest was getting cut down,
so at least we saved them.

501
00:27:42.931 --> 00:27:44.510
And I'm like,
is that really saving them,
putting,

502
00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:47.910
putting a natural animal that has instincts that are predatory and then dangling

503
00:27:47.911 --> 00:27:52.470
meat from a poll for it or having it pace and a four by four cell and they don't

504
00:27:52.471 --> 00:27:55.590
even fucking get Wifi.
They don't even have wifi.

505
00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:58.140
They don't have anything to kill even a hot,
you know,
and that's,

506
00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:01.710
that's something that they do do in other countries,
like in other countries,

507
00:28:01.711 --> 00:28:06.330
especially in Asia,
when they have tiger preserves,
they preserve these tigers,

508
00:28:06.331 --> 00:28:08.370
but they feed them live goats.
Right.

509
00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:11.580
Have you ever seen that Brian throwing throw a few of those up because there's

510
00:28:11.581 --> 00:28:14.010
hundreds of them online I've seen preserves where they feed them.

511
00:28:14.011 --> 00:28:17.310
Like they fed the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park,
which is a goat on a chain,

512
00:28:17.610 --> 00:28:20.490
which better than just handing it the meat that's already killed.

513
00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:22.620
But at some point you got to let,
you should let them go.
Go.

514
00:28:22.621 --> 00:28:25.350
You should let them actually hunt and [inaudible] and you know,

515
00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:28.030
go through those animalistic behavior.
Yeah,

516
00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:32.790
that would be better if you had like an ecosystem in a place.

517
00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:34.740
But even that you shouldn't contain it.

518
00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:39.300
It shouldn't be that this tiger has no idea what happens if he walks 20 miles to

519
00:28:39.301 --> 00:28:39.990
the ocean.

520
00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:42.780
It shouldn't be that the tiger should be able to go wherever the fuck the tiger

521
00:28:42.781 --> 00:28:45.780
is,
if that's his habitat,
unless we choose to make them extinct.

522
00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:47.460
If we choose it too fucking dangerous,

523
00:28:47.461 --> 00:28:50.340
they're eating too many people and we gotta start jacking him,
which by the way,

524
00:28:50.341 --> 00:28:53.610
if I lived in India,
I'd be hunting tigers every fucking day of the week.

525
00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:56.580
More people have died from tigers in India than anywhere in the world.

526
00:28:56.700 --> 00:29:01.190
They had like just the Sunderbans alone is at somewhere like 300,000 people have

527
00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:04.650
been murdered by tigers over the last hundred years and that's because they're

528
00:29:04.651 --> 00:29:07.470
building in their habitat or because they're trying to keep them as pets because

529
00:29:07.471 --> 00:29:11.640
poor people are living near a monster.
I mean,
it's a crime.
Not only that,

530
00:29:11.641 --> 00:29:16.260
there's bands is a a,
it's a brackish ocean and apparently they have a,

531
00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:19.980
the tigers drink this water and the water is extra salty,

532
00:29:19.981 --> 00:29:21.660
so it makes some really aggressive.

533
00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:24.570
It makes him irritated all the time and they're really me.
Yeah.

534
00:29:24.571 --> 00:29:27.750
I had a bit about it in my act.
A true story about these poor fucking fishermen.

535
00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:28.681
They were in a boat.

536
00:29:28.681 --> 00:29:32.460
There was like five guys in a boat and this tiger swam out to the boat,

537
00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:36.840
jumped in,
killed the guy,
dragged him through the water to the shore,

538
00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:40.100
dropped his body off of the shore,
jumped back in the water,

539
00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:44.290
go get the other guys and did it again.
Did it three times.
He did it three times,

540
00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:46.240
so the last two guys were just fucking

541
00:29:48.610 --> 00:29:51.040
fucking start paddling,
dude.
You got to figure something out.

542
00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:52.000
You know what's happening?

543
00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:56.370
Who Knew Tigers with that fucking evil like they are really are monsters because

544
00:29:56.371 --> 00:29:57.850
then they're not doing it for food.

545
00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:00.870
They're doing it because they can like at that point Tomic how?

546
00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:03.790
How could you just,
I want to swipe off a years and make a necklace.

547
00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:06.640
They are doing it for the sport.
How could you justify keeping that thing around?

548
00:30:06.641 --> 00:30:09.310
What does this a bowl?
This is a goat feeding from a,
that's a cow.

549
00:30:09.311 --> 00:30:12.360
I guess it looks like.
There it is.
Yeah,
the cow.
Fuck.
Oh,
there we go.

550
00:30:12.370 --> 00:30:13.390
Right over to his.

551
00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:16.480
John's like you rushed him a little bit like too is talking shit.
Yeah,

552
00:30:16.481 --> 00:30:19.090
I'll spear this motherfucker.
I like how they go Jujitsu style.

553
00:30:19.091 --> 00:30:22.770
They go right to the bottom and then we'll call this call.
It's like,
okay,

554
00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:25.630
he's got site control and he's got the neck.
As long as he's got the knack,

555
00:30:25.631 --> 00:30:27.280
he's good.
He's got the top of the spine now.

556
00:30:27.281 --> 00:30:30.430
This is really hard for the cow to get anything done here.

557
00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:33.020
He's at least the cow standing though.
The key.

558
00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:36.910
The cows got to figure out some way to go to his back and kick that thing off

559
00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:40.480
and then get back to his feet and run away,
but it doesn't look good.

560
00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:43.470
The Tiger's got the back of the neck.
I think he's fucked.

561
00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:45.940
Don't forget to check out a new season of the ultimate fighter.

562
00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:51.250
There's a dead cow.
I don't get it.
Oh,
there's a live cow.
Oh,

563
00:30:51.251 --> 00:30:54.580
they have a long time.
Shit.
Yeah.
Look how they bring them out.

564
00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:57.880
That poor cow before they let him get killed by a lion.

565
00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.240
He gets a few with shit dragged by a golf cart.

566
00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:06.070
He gets fucking ball gagged and strung up by his hooves and that's,

567
00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:10.680
that's exactly what they did to him.
That's fucking crazy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Zoo.

568
00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:15.260
But so Santa Barbara Zoo was exciting for you?
It was good or it was,
it was sad.

569
00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:19.300
Just sad.
It's cool because the kids get to see the,
the,
the fucking animal jail.

570
00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:22.600
But it's sad when you see,
you explain to them like,
Hey,

571
00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:25.290
this is not natural for these animals.
I mean,
or you know,

572
00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:28.650
you just let it sit for and to,
you know,
so it's just like,
this is,
no,

573
00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:31.560
I'm not being upset.
I'm just being very passionate.

574
00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:35.170
I'm just saying when I explained to them,
it's just like I get,

575
00:31:35.290 --> 00:31:38.140
I just want them to repeat the names and know where it lives and what it's,

576
00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:42.460
what it does.
And then eventually we'll get to purpose though.
That's an really,

577
00:31:42.461 --> 00:31:45.030
I would rather show them DVDs.
I really would.
But you know,

578
00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:47.740
kids like looking at Shit,
you know,
they,
they,
they,

579
00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:52.120
I can never get my daughter sit down and watch like a documentary on the Congo

580
00:31:52.121 --> 00:31:52.954
or something like that.

581
00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:56.530
But if you take him somewhere and show them some actual real shit,
you know,

582
00:31:56.531 --> 00:31:58.620
that's,
that has a different impact on them.

583
00:31:58.790 --> 00:32:01.750
But what my point was while standing there looking at the gorillas,

584
00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:05.680
I was looking at a gorilla and looking at me and then thinking about gray
aliens.

585
00:32:05.681 --> 00:32:08.950
I'm like,
yeah,
that's next.
It has to be.
That really is us.

586
00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:11.410
Like I think those fucking eyes,

587
00:32:11.411 --> 00:32:14.800
it's because they have like builtin sunglasses because we've completely fucked

588
00:32:14.801 --> 00:32:16.750
the environment.
You can't see anymore.

589
00:32:16.751 --> 00:32:20.110
You go outside active layers and reflective coatings.

590
00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:24.370
They have those big fucking totally black eyes that shits his sunglasses,

591
00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:30.300
builtin sunglasses or Oakleys and 40 20 to our eyes got way bigger after Google

592
00:32:30.671 --> 00:32:34.180
goggles.
It's like an unexpected turn.
Well,
Google goggles,

593
00:32:34.181 --> 00:32:36.700
not only does it give you cancer of the brain,

594
00:32:36.850 --> 00:32:40.490
but that cancer specifically makes your eyes grow.
That changed evolution.

595
00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:41.301
<v 0>So that's what happened.</v>

596
00:32:41.301 --> 00:32:45.290
The human eye because of the large almond sized or shaped.

597
00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:49.850
So when that happened,
and then eventually we went with pure telekinesis,

598
00:32:49.851 --> 00:32:54.530
people stopped talking to mouth shrunk up.
We won't need physical vessels once.

599
00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:57.620
Once we can figure out how to digitize the consciousness,

600
00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:01.550
especially if the physical physical vessel is going to be universal.

601
00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:04.820
Indiscernible like it looks like the gray aliens are the gray aliens.

602
00:33:04.821 --> 00:33:09.660
It's not like you see like a Shaquille O'Neal gray alien right next to the image

603
00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:13.280
racist.
You're saying they all look the same and I see completely different

604
00:33:13.281 --> 00:33:16.110
personalities.
I can pick out Doug from Zana do.
All right.
Okay.

605
00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:22.000
Have you ever had any sort of an experience with anything that you thought was

606
00:33:22.450 --> 00:33:27.350
paranormal,
whether it was a ghost?
Yeah,
I mean on Salvia,

607
00:33:27.351 --> 00:33:30.950
I've,
I've experienced the universe as a pixel of a human being.

608
00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:33.910
I've absolutely seen it and felt it and understood it,
but sober,

609
00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:38.270
I haven't felt like phantoms are cold chills or word sobers a very interesting

610
00:33:38.271 --> 00:33:40.390
word because I agree.
You know,

611
00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:45.290
I agree with the idea to a certain extent that when you're,

612
00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:50.300
when you're intoxicated that that is an impaired state and that what you're

613
00:33:50.301 --> 00:33:55.280
saying is probably not real.
It's just a distortion of all your,
you know,

614
00:33:55.281 --> 00:33:58.670
your,
your,
your sort of,
your sensory perceptions and the,
you know,

615
00:33:58.671 --> 00:34:02.700
your body reacting to poison and you can trick your body into synesthesia where

616
00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:03.763
however,

617
00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:09.130
there's times when I'm high or I completely disagree that it's not that you

618
00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:16.580
wouldn't eat it.
It's not an,
it's not an impaired state.
It's an enhanced state.

619
00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:18.350
It's very difficult to manage,

620
00:34:18.410 --> 00:34:22.550
enhance state and there's a lot going on but it's not impaired.
It's modified,

621
00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:26.540
it's modified,
modified.
It's,
it makes reality a little slippery.

622
00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:28.760
You can get socially awkward,
you can get paranoid.

623
00:34:28.761 --> 00:34:32.870
There's a lot of things that can happen that what it is is you have a massive

624
00:34:32.871 --> 00:34:37.130
amount of extra sensitivity and it's almost the exact opposite of being drunk

625
00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:39.680
and what people don't understand.
It's like,
oh,
he's impaired.

626
00:34:39.690 --> 00:34:43.550
He's on the pot when I'm on the pot.
Okay.
I'm like,

627
00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:47.750
I play pool twice as good,
maybe three times as good.

628
00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:51.350
I can play like professional level for long stretches of time when I'm high as

629
00:34:51.351 --> 00:34:53.600
fuck my cow,
I write better comedy.

630
00:34:53.601 --> 00:34:57.030
Like there's a lot going on that you can't say is,
is a,

631
00:34:57.190 --> 00:35:01.190
there's no downside of that.
There's no,
it's not a detrimental situation.

632
00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:04.170
And Carl Sagan has said something that I,
it's,
uh,

633
00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:09.050
my quote on my message board and when he said it,
I was like,
thank you.
It says,

634
00:35:09.051 --> 00:35:12.620
I am convinced that there are genuine and valid levels of perception available

635
00:35:12.621 --> 00:35:14.750
with cannabis and probably with other drugs,

636
00:35:14.751 --> 00:35:18.770
which are through the defects of our society and our educational system

637
00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:22.940
unavailable to us without such drugs.
And those are those,

638
00:35:22.970 --> 00:35:27.560
there's real like clarity in,
in some of these experiences.

639
00:35:27.830 --> 00:35:31.820
It's just so much recreational use is so much fucking around with all of us that

640
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.820
it's been,
especially with people who don't do any of these things,

641
00:35:34.821 --> 00:35:36.560
they don't smoke pot.
They've never done mushrooms.

642
00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:38.430
That it seems like a recreational,

643
00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:42.120
<v 2>silly type activity.
It doesn't seem like there's any validity.
Well,
they're,
yeah,</v>

644
00:35:42.121 --> 00:35:44.350
they're still,
and they're still banking off of the,
uh,

645
00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:47.250
the stories and the connotations that have been handed down since the reefer

646
00:35:47.251 --> 00:35:50.210
madness days from grandpa told someone's parents that,

647
00:35:50.290 --> 00:35:53.380
that referral make you silly.
It'll make you crazy and make you a,
you know,

648
00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:54.440
a Druggie,

649
00:35:54.450 --> 00:35:57.630
you'll be a no nothing and then that just gets handed down and handed down.

650
00:35:57.660 --> 00:35:58.710
It would be really cute.

651
00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:02.880
We would be a cute fun thing to watch bumble into walls if it wasn't for all the

652
00:36:02.881 --> 00:36:06.480
violence.
If it wasn't for like the shit that's going down today in Spain.

653
00:36:06.690 --> 00:36:08.730
Have you seen the ship Brian and just seeing the video,

654
00:36:08.731 --> 00:36:12.050
please pull up the video of the Spain protesting because it is crazy.
Yeah.

655
00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:16.380
The [inaudible] news.
Fuck you CNN.

656
00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:19.920
Fuck you.
Fox News.
You guys suck.

657
00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:22.500
You are fucking frauds.

658
00:36:22.830 --> 00:36:27.120
They are not the news cogs in the machine.
The owned by corporations to to,

659
00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:29.860
to facilitate an agenda.
It's propaganda.
Keyless.

660
00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:34.380
The fact that no one's covering what's going on in Bahrain,
no one is covering.

661
00:36:34.381 --> 00:36:38.610
I mean there's the amount of coverage in America on this Spain thing is shameful

662
00:36:38.611 --> 00:36:41.340
and their depiction of it is shamefully inaccurate.

663
00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:44.340
That it's just a small protest and it's,
no,

664
00:36:44.341 --> 00:36:49.341
this is a fucking whole civilization rising up against their leaders.

665
00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:52.860
I mean people are looting for food and trash bins.

666
00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:57.420
That's how dire the situation has got for a large section of that population and

667
00:36:57.421 --> 00:37:00.730
now they're taking to the streets and nobody knows about it and the the,

668
00:37:00.731 --> 00:37:05.731
the actual reported figures of unemployment or at 25% but those are disputed by

669
00:37:06.151 --> 00:37:09.030
the population that they say that it could be even worse than that.

670
00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:13.140
The reported numbers of,
um,
and by the way,
those figures,

671
00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:17.010
they only count those who are actively seeking employment and are unable to find

672
00:37:17.011 --> 00:37:20.160
it.
Which means if 25% is statistically unemployed,

673
00:37:20.161 --> 00:37:24.390
there might be another 25% that it's fucking given up your exactly resorting to

674
00:37:24.391 --> 00:37:27.120
trash cans and now looting.
Yeah,
you're exactly right.

675
00:37:27.121 --> 00:37:30.750
That's the people that are still in the system that are being counted as

676
00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:35.640
unemployed and people use that as an example of our society because our society,

677
00:37:35.641 --> 00:37:39.780
we try to keep it unemployment's down.
It's up.
How you don't,
you don't know shit.

678
00:37:39.810 --> 00:37:42.990
You don't know shit.
Absolutely.
Do you know about people that are in your system?

679
00:37:42.991 --> 00:37:43.411
That's it.

680
00:37:43.411 --> 00:37:47.850
There's a huge amount of people out there that have fucking thrown in the towel

681
00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:52.590
and it's,
that's what's going on in Spain.
It's,
if you see,
look at the videos,

682
00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:56.730
it's fucking notice the badge in the corner.
Not Cnn,
not MSNBC,

683
00:37:56.910 --> 00:38:01.530
not fox,
nothing.
It's,
you know,
it's,
we've done such a terrible job.

684
00:38:01.531 --> 00:38:05.790
What is our t stand for again?
It's not Reuters,
it's a God.

685
00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:08.610
I watch other stuff and all the time piece with a fucking hell.

686
00:38:08.650 --> 00:38:12.330
A little button while they're taking pictures of them.
This is crazy.

687
00:38:12.450 --> 00:38:15.960
But what's really crazy is he's fucking cops,
man.
Like they,

688
00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:19.560
they are just employees of the machine.
They're not even the machine.

689
00:38:19.561 --> 00:38:20.910
They're regular folks.
Yup.

690
00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:23.280
The regular folks are attacking regular for these people.

691
00:38:23.310 --> 00:38:25.500
These people are fighting for their jobs right now,

692
00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:28.380
just as the people riding are trying to fight for jobs.

693
00:38:28.381 --> 00:38:31.020
And that's what's so sad is that this is how disconnected it is.

694
00:38:31.050 --> 00:38:33.990
They have to lay down their arms.
It has to get worse.

695
00:38:33.991 --> 00:38:37.480
It has to get worse to the point where the cops realize,
okay,

696
00:38:37.481 --> 00:38:41.800
we are the civilization.
We are this.
They are clubbing.

697
00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:46.180
Oh look at that guy kick roundhouse kick to the body.
Very weak roundhouse kick.

698
00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:47.770
No,
no turn of the hips at all.
Look,

699
00:38:47.771 --> 00:38:51.130
people are kicking them and pushing them down.
That's fucking crazy man.

700
00:38:51.131 --> 00:38:54.370
That cops,
nobody took his back.
Someone should have taken his back.
Yeah,

701
00:38:54.371 --> 00:38:57.610
well they're going to busy.
Sounds like you got to get over under soon.

702
00:38:57.611 --> 00:39:01.430
They'll bring out the sonic weaponry and the and the drones and the UAE fees and

703
00:39:01.431 --> 00:39:01.691
that.
I mean,

704
00:39:01.691 --> 00:39:04.360
that's why this kind of descent doesn't happen in the states right now because

705
00:39:04.361 --> 00:39:05.194
we have,
uh,

706
00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:09.060
we have a military that's a police force that will roll out not only that,

707
00:39:09.070 --> 00:39:13.240
vehicles on rifles,
we have new laws protecting the clients.

708
00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:16.990
Just in case this shit goes down where they legally can do a bunch of shit that

709
00:39:16.991 --> 00:39:19.120
they would never allow it to do.
Just a couple of years.

710
00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:22.570
They can pull you off the streets and detain you before anything ever happens

711
00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:26.410
because you might be a thought leader.
And you know,
it's really disturbing to me.

712
00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:29.430
All these celebrities and all these different people who are,

713
00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:32.620
are standing up for Obama and campaigning for Obama.

714
00:39:32.621 --> 00:39:35.560
And even like guys that I respect and intelligent people are saying and keys

715
00:39:35.561 --> 00:39:40.000
better than Mitt Romney.
Like it's what,
what did you,
what are you looking at?

716
00:39:40.001 --> 00:39:41.620
I'm like,
what are you looking at?
You are you,

717
00:39:41.650 --> 00:39:44.340
are you paying attention to what this guy is doing to the constitution?

718
00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:49.150
They're cherry picking a few moral issues,
which is always what it boils down to,

719
00:39:49.151 --> 00:39:50.560
which is sad.
Uh,
you know,

720
00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:54.970
I happen to agree with the moral stance of Obama versus Romney a little bit
more,

721
00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:59.620
but it doesn't fucking matter what aspect of his civil unions.

722
00:39:59.650 --> 00:40:02.590
Gay Rights.
Gay Rights.
That's a big one.
You know what that is?

723
00:40:02.591 --> 00:40:05.920
That's a democratic talking point.
Sure.
You know,
he,
he is,

724
00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:07.660
cause they won't talk about money in politics,

725
00:40:07.690 --> 00:40:10.850
which is the root of 90% of all the fucking issues we have right now.

726
00:40:10.850 --> 00:40:13.540
And nobody's going to talk about it cause it's what lining their pockets.
Yeah.

727
00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:14.100
When you,

728
00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:18.490
when it comes to something that's actually important that he is not standing up

729
00:40:18.491 --> 00:40:19.870
for us.
Nope.
When it comes for it,

730
00:40:19.871 --> 00:40:22.600
they're going to rate the dispensaries here in la despite saying that's not

731
00:40:22.601 --> 00:40:26.370
going to happen.
What they just did,
they just closed in on 71 of them.
Yeah.

732
00:40:26.410 --> 00:40:29.260
Well they sent,
they sent notices to a bunch and they're suing to,

733
00:40:29.261 --> 00:40:32.530
they haven't started shattering glass yet,
but believe me,
that's two weeks away.

734
00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:36.790
Yeah.
The whole thing is really sick and this is supposed to be this awesome

735
00:40:36.791 --> 00:40:39.460
presidents regime.
I mean,
he's running things right now.

736
00:40:39.610 --> 00:40:42.960
Who's running things right now while he's running a campaign is

737
00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:49.060
fucking doing this.
Should it be nonprofit?
Shut up.

738
00:40:49.090 --> 00:40:53.980
You're telling me that the DEA that has nothing better to do for real then go

739
00:40:53.981 --> 00:40:58.540
after pot companies.
That is one of the weakest ways to get a color.
By the way,

740
00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:03.520
700 dispensary's can't be opened and operated and less.

741
00:41:03.521 --> 00:41:06.610
There's fucking demand for 700 dispensary's.

742
00:41:07.690 --> 00:41:11.710
How about the [inaudible] is a law that says you're allowed to have it here and

743
00:41:11.711 --> 00:41:13.780
to pretend that it's worse than anything else,

744
00:41:13.781 --> 00:41:17.290
that you've already got legal and this is a reason why you're going after it.

745
00:41:17.291 --> 00:41:19.660
It's crazy.
Obama.

746
00:41:19.690 --> 00:41:22.720
That's why I'm always against the medicinal marijuana argument because it

747
00:41:22.721 --> 00:41:24.550
ignores the recreational argument,

748
00:41:24.551 --> 00:41:27.880
which is just as fucking valid as the medicinal one certainly is,

749
00:41:27.881 --> 00:41:31.300
but the medicinal one,
I think while in a world of madness,

750
00:41:31.330 --> 00:41:34.190
there's a lot of people,
not me as necessarily

751
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:35.520
<v 3>I could get by without it.
They're,</v>

752
00:41:35.521 --> 00:41:38.660
the reasons that I use it for is not nothing's terminal.

753
00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:41.000
There's people who have terminal illnesses,
illnesses.

754
00:41:41.001 --> 00:41:44.270
There's people who have cancer and marijuana is the only thing that gives them

755
00:41:44.271 --> 00:41:44.920
an appetite,

756
00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:48.740
like there's nothing else that works as good people that will have seizures if

757
00:41:48.741 --> 00:41:50.450
they do not smoke pot,

758
00:41:50.451 --> 00:41:52.880
and yet someone is pulling the joint out of their hand and saying,
no,
no,
no,

759
00:41:52.881 --> 00:41:55.640
you need to have a seizure because a,
this needs to be illegal.

760
00:41:55.641 --> 00:41:59.730
That's why when whenever anybody talks about the human body and they're,

761
00:41:59.731 --> 00:42:04.731
they're doing it from an ideological standpoint without any real medical

762
00:42:04.821 --> 00:42:06.380
training or even reading research,

763
00:42:06.381 --> 00:42:09.140
you're talking to any your ass like when you got to be an asshole,

764
00:42:09.141 --> 00:42:13.040
like rush limbo that's talking about some girl wanting to be a slut so she can

765
00:42:13.041 --> 00:42:13.874
get a birth control.

766
00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:18.380
Would that asshole doesn't understand is that some women get ovarian cysts if

767
00:42:18.381 --> 00:42:20.900
they don't take birth control.
They have medical issues.

768
00:42:21.050 --> 00:42:24.590
There's a lot of them that women can use birth control with and it cleans them

769
00:42:24.591 --> 00:42:25.700
up.
Sorry,
Joe.

770
00:42:25.701 --> 00:42:29.450
He's just popped a handful of oxycontin and chased it with alcohol so he can't

771
00:42:29.451 --> 00:42:32.870
hear you right now because let's not forget he was chastising people who wanted

772
00:42:32.871 --> 00:42:36.290
to smoke pot while taking handfuls of pharmaceuticals.
Well,
not only that,

773
00:42:36.291 --> 00:42:39.950
he was doing it illegally.
He was having his made go out and buy his,
uh,

774
00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:42.380
he's oxies forum.
They said,
we,
we researched it,

775
00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:47.620
we researched it on Wikipedia and it said that he was up to 30 a day according

776
00:42:48.051 --> 00:42:50.480
to his made decided by Johnny balls.
17.

777
00:42:50.481 --> 00:42:51.770
He's the one who put that sentence in there.

778
00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:57.250
He is the most trusted source on the Wikipedia cut to the Johnny Ball 17 Twitter

779
00:42:57.381 --> 00:43:01.610
account.
Johnny was just open.
There's a scramble for it right now.

780
00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:03.850
I hope there is.
Yeah.
It's insane.

781
00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:06.510
When I think about unemployment and I think about an eye,

782
00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:10.160
this may transition into a TSA rant and I apologize if it does cause it's still

783
00:43:10.161 --> 00:43:12.050
fresh.
Yeah,
well we got to talk about that.
Anyway,

784
00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:15.920
the biggest fucking government works program that's really going on right now.

785
00:43:16.130 --> 00:43:20.960
Our tax dollars going to create a system to create jobs to demean us and make us

786
00:43:20.961 --> 00:43:25.910
feel like criminals from wanting to take a flight,
a program that is inefficient,

787
00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:28.910
ineffectual by thousands of not thousands.

788
00:43:28.911 --> 00:43:32.450
That's hyperbole by hundreds of sorted papers that is inefficient,

789
00:43:32.451 --> 00:43:34.280
ineffective fuel that demeans us.

790
00:43:34.310 --> 00:43:38.480
That leads to a lobbyists in government kickbacks for these corporations that

791
00:43:38.481 --> 00:43:40.670
make machines that scan us and take nude photos.

792
00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:44.810
It's essentially are the folks that do it for the folks that do the Tsa,

793
00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:48.410
it is a shit job.
Yeah.
You're dealing with people that don't want to be there.

794
00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:52.850
Absolutely.
Dealing with people that don't want to comply and in their defense.

795
00:43:52.970 --> 00:43:53.181
Look,

796
00:43:53.181 --> 00:43:56.510
there's that fucking classic Stanford study that we brought up over and over

797
00:43:56.511 --> 00:43:59.900
again of what happened when they just had college students have one person in

798
00:43:59.901 --> 00:44:03.230
charge or the board.
The other person is,
yeah,
the prisoner.
When they,

799
00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:06.530
when you do that,
people abuse people.
People were supposed to be equal folks.

800
00:44:06.531 --> 00:44:09.270
That's just the way it is.
It's not,
there's not supposed to be cops for the,

801
00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:12.660
isn't there a law?
Isn't there a law against uniforms for,

802
00:44:12.661 --> 00:44:15.710
for people that aren't law enforcement officials having uh,

803
00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:19.350
like markings or patterns are then how do you work at Burger King?
But no,
no,
no.

804
00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:20.121
Well,
because you're not,

805
00:44:20.121 --> 00:44:22.160
you're not wearing a badge and you're not wearing patches.

806
00:44:22.190 --> 00:44:25.310
You are a few of the manager.
You have a sheriff's a 10 share of bad.
It's,

807
00:44:25.311 --> 00:44:29.180
I believe the Colonel Sanders about stripes doesn't cross it.

808
00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:32.020
I'm the of this grill.
Well

809
00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:34.200
<v 1>you should like,
but they're not,
they're not actually by the way.</v>

810
00:44:34.201 --> 00:44:35.420
They're not cops.
They are.

811
00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:39.210
They are regular folks that are wearing 10 badges and patches and I've met a lot

812
00:44:39.211 --> 00:44:42.340
of fans there but that's different that the cops are here,

813
00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:46.170
port police and they are police officers and they come in when the shit actually

814
00:44:46.171 --> 00:44:50.080
gets mailed to mace you and Frisk you.
I've never had a problem at the,

815
00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:53.670
at the TSA ever with people being rude to me with people.

816
00:44:53.671 --> 00:44:55.830
I've never had that problem.
But do you go through the machines?

817
00:44:55.850 --> 00:45:00.780
I go through the machines and I'm friendly.
I'm friendly,
I'm friendly shit,

818
00:45:00.990 --> 00:45:04.380
but I opt out.
Brendan Walsh said that he had a problem with the same thing.

819
00:45:04.381 --> 00:45:05.970
He opted out on the way to Toronto.

820
00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:08.730
What I've heard is that this radiation in those machines,

821
00:45:08.731 --> 00:45:10.230
they have a really registered it yet,

822
00:45:10.250 --> 00:45:12.720
but if you really want to worry about radiation you shouldn't be showing on the

823
00:45:12.721 --> 00:45:17.010
first place because the flight itself is incredibly re Radiohead radiation.

824
00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:20.750
It to me is is a moot point.
Like yeah,
I don't think I deserve it.

825
00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:25.110
It's a violation.
It's a rights violation plus the rapid scan corporation,

826
00:45:25.111 --> 00:45:27.680
which is one of the two big corporations that had like,
you know,

827
00:45:27.690 --> 00:45:30.450
the $70 million contracts to install these machines.

828
00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:34.590
They were funding Chertoff who was the ex head of the Homeland Security

829
00:45:34.590 --> 00:45:37.770
Administration.
Like they've increased their lobbying five,
five,
uh,
uh,
by,

830
00:45:37.790 --> 00:45:41.520
by like 50% or something since 2008,
2010.
That was the last study I read.

831
00:45:41.521 --> 00:45:44.520
So Lord knows how much money they're spending now to kick.

832
00:45:44.521 --> 00:45:48.420
They get kickbacks to people in power to do these no bid contracts to put in

833
00:45:48.421 --> 00:45:50.130
these machines,
which by the way,

834
00:45:50.430 --> 00:45:54.420
most most security and defense experts tell you that they can't actually detect

835
00:45:55.050 --> 00:45:58.050
the plastic explosives that could blow up at seven 47.

836
00:45:58.440 --> 00:45:59.940
Like they can't actually detect it.

837
00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:04.230
Plus there was a case in Florida just not only like probably two years ago where

838
00:46:04.231 --> 00:46:08.430
hundreds of thousands of the photos from people going through those machines

839
00:46:08.431 --> 00:46:10.680
because it does store photos,
even though it doesn't display him.

840
00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:14.760
Those photos were hacked and it was.
They said,
we don't store these photos,

841
00:46:14.761 --> 00:46:18.240
they don't get taken,
but they have a nude picture of you somewhere,
Lord.

842
00:46:18.241 --> 00:46:20.430
No Lord knows how that's going to come back to haunt you.

843
00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:24.420
So the radiation is to me a moot point.
I look good naked dude.

844
00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:28.080
I want to see at least the house there's going to be at Tsa Fetish Porn.

845
00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:32.220
Absolutely going to be fetish,
say people release the hounds.

846
00:46:32.250 --> 00:46:36.930
It's just absurd to me that my tax dollars go towards buying these machines for

847
00:46:36.931 --> 00:46:40.560
these corrupt corporations to have them installed to make me feel like a

848
00:46:40.561 --> 00:46:42.090
criminal,
to snap a photo of me naked,

849
00:46:42.091 --> 00:46:45.210
which don't make me any safer as I go onto a flight.

850
00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:47.010
You think it doesn't make you any safer?

851
00:46:47.011 --> 00:46:49.170
Don't you think that the people could take guns on planes?

852
00:46:49.171 --> 00:46:51.720
They would if it was no metal detection,

853
00:46:51.721 --> 00:46:56.340
you would have to deal with the same sort of instances of people being crazy in

854
00:46:56.341 --> 00:47:01.140
society on a plane as you would on the ground.
I think metal detectors are good.

855
00:47:01.290 --> 00:47:05.910
I do.
I think the idea of checking your bags is good.
There's too many cons.

856
00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:06.960
There are certainly,

857
00:47:06.961 --> 00:47:10.110
there are certainly there should be a standard of protection.
You know,

858
00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:12.720
metal detector.
Do you want to scan the baggage of that's fine,

859
00:47:12.721 --> 00:47:16.860
but I think we've drawn the line way too far and we've drawn it to a point now

860
00:47:16.861 --> 00:47:19.860
where if an like,
first of all,
we've always been one step behind.

861
00:47:19.861 --> 00:47:22.500
Let's not forget nine 11 happened with box cutters.
All right?

862
00:47:22.501 --> 00:47:25.350
There was no explosives that were no bombs.
There were no guns.

863
00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:29.860
It was Fox messy official story and Info wars.com

864
00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:34.150
<v 4>we know if the government inside job bin Ladin to a determined to attack.</v>

865
00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:36.610
We've got the documents,
ladies and gentlemen,

866
00:47:37.930 --> 00:47:42.930
there is no way you can take over a plane with a box cutter.

867
00:47:43.690 --> 00:47:47.830
Look at this article by Johnny Balls.
17 he has done the math.

868
00:47:48.370 --> 00:47:49.240
It checks out.

869
00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:54.300
If you going to infowars.com and buy gold and a crank flashlight and the crank

870
00:47:54.510 --> 00:47:59.510
fleshlight Anita a crank fleshlight slash radio fuck your way to freedom.

871
00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:01.520
Yeah.

872
00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:04.880
<v 1>I believe the official story,
the most fantastical stories,
by the way,</v>

873
00:48:04.881 --> 00:48:08.350
those flashlights need a rechargeable battery on them so they can heat up.
Yeah.

874
00:48:08.690 --> 00:48:10.310
I should be able to press a button and have it get one,

875
00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:12.080
but we don't use them anymore,
so I don't be,

876
00:48:12.081 --> 00:48:15.650
don't fuck you mean you don't fall apart.
You don't talk about them.

877
00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:19.260
And if you don't do it anymore,
do you still fuck them though?
Uh,

878
00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:26.770
<v 4>there's</v>

879
00:48:26.770 --> 00:48:28.960
<v 1>not one good sponsor,
but it's,</v>

880
00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:33.340
I think it got to a point where we probably saturated their market and quite

881
00:48:33.341 --> 00:48:37.740
honestly,
we made more money from other people.
Um,

882
00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:42.190
yeah,
we're always one step behind.
So here's what,

883
00:48:42.191 --> 00:48:46.060
here's what concerns me is that now we're at a point where let's say they take

884
00:48:46.061 --> 00:48:50.160
away the rapid scan machines,
right?
Or let's say they have them,
but uh,

885
00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:55.260
someone flying Spaghetti Monster for bid decides to blow up a school or a

886
00:48:56.561 --> 00:49:00.580
footlocker in a mall or a stadium or a concert venue.

887
00:49:00.910 --> 00:49:02.710
Those machines are going to be everywhere.

888
00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:06.430
What do you think would happen if you went to the airport and you had like a

889
00:49:06.431 --> 00:49:08.080
radiation detector and you said,

890
00:49:08.081 --> 00:49:11.230
I would like to go through this machine and [inaudible] they wouldn't let you.

891
00:49:11.231 --> 00:49:13.520
There's no way they would let you,
it's probably arrest you,
right?
Yeah.

892
00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:16.410
What does that machinery,
you're not allowed to have it here.
They creep in.

893
00:49:16.411 --> 00:49:19.390
My incident in Austin,
I was told I was not allowed to film it.

894
00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:21.580
I was brought into a private,
secrete,

895
00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:24.010
a screening room that had a giant placard above.

896
00:49:24.011 --> 00:49:27.010
It says this is a private screening room,
which I did not request.

897
00:49:27.011 --> 00:49:30.050
I was taken in there.
My belongings were taken in there without my request.

898
00:49:30.051 --> 00:49:33.370
I even objected to it and they said,
you have to go this way.
Did you have to,

899
00:49:33.371 --> 00:49:34.520
is that the law yet?

900
00:49:34.570 --> 00:49:37.180
At this point I didn't have time to fight and I had to catch a flight.

901
00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:39.460
See the thing is with the Patriot Act and shit like that,

902
00:49:39.461 --> 00:49:40.450
you don't know what the fuck is.

903
00:49:40.451 --> 00:49:43.960
Terrorism on paper these days get up as they go along and then they have lawyers

904
00:49:43.961 --> 00:49:47.110
figure out how,
what however they treated you is the legal way to treat you.

905
00:49:47.620 --> 00:49:51.180
Sons of bitches,
we going bitch,
they had the x ray get bagger.
I gotta,

906
00:49:51.181 --> 00:49:52.210
I gotta have you pull something up.

907
00:49:52.270 --> 00:49:54.610
They have the x ray machine in the Austin airport and it's right next to one of

908
00:49:54.611 --> 00:49:56.420
those rapid scan body scanning machines,
right?

909
00:49:57.070 --> 00:50:00.730
And there's a long line for the rapid scan machine and that's when they say,

910
00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:04.120
oh that lines get long.
Come on through the x rays.
So right away I'm like,

911
00:50:04.121 --> 00:50:06.160
you know what,
if this is integral to my safety,

912
00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:10.030
you're now chucking my safety out the window for the convenience factor of

913
00:50:10.031 --> 00:50:13.570
cycling people through security.
Well they really sang that it's not safe.

914
00:50:13.990 --> 00:50:16.990
And these are really what they're saying the rabbits can thing or the,
no,
no,
no.

915
00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:19.240
I'm talking about,
I'm talking about if we need those,

916
00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:22.240
those body scanning machines because they can detect a whole bunch of stuff that

917
00:50:22.241 --> 00:50:23.530
a traditional x ray can't.

918
00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:26.410
When it gets to inconvenient because the line is too long,

919
00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:29.330
you're now throwing my safety out the window.
That seems inconsistent.

920
00:50:29.450 --> 00:50:30.950
Sound seems wrong,
right?
It's crazy.

921
00:50:31.130 --> 00:50:35.030
But I'm in line to go through the x ray and then randomly they do the,

922
00:50:35.090 --> 00:50:36.640
you need to go through the rapid scan machine.
So I said,

923
00:50:36.641 --> 00:50:38.570
can I just go through the x Ray?
No,
you can't.

924
00:50:38.610 --> 00:50:40.370
Now they're angry with me because I even asked that.

925
00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:44.000
So I opt out as I normally do,
my belongings go through the machine.

926
00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:47.720
Now I can't see them.
I say,
Hey,
I can't see my laptop.
I can't see my phone.

927
00:50:47.721 --> 00:50:49.430
I can't seem to that stuff.
It's over there.
You're leaving.

928
00:50:49.450 --> 00:50:52.220
Your belongings are fine.
How do I know that?
I can't see them.

929
00:50:52.221 --> 00:50:55.160
They didn't give anybody to do it.
So I'm already on edge.
Right.
I always hit it.

930
00:50:55.161 --> 00:50:57.170
Always feel like whenever I take a fucking jet blue flight,

931
00:50:57.171 --> 00:50:58.310
this is gonna be my occupied moment.

932
00:50:58.311 --> 00:51:01.010
It's gonna end with pepper spray to the face and I'm gonna get handcuffed even

933
00:51:01.011 --> 00:51:02.960
though miss politesse can be.
And I just,

934
00:51:02.961 --> 00:51:04.630
I just want someone to watch my shit right.

935
00:51:04.820 --> 00:51:08.570
I get stuck in a glass box where I'm next to a girl that couldn't have been more

936
00:51:08.571 --> 00:51:12.020
than six years old.
Um,
she has a,
uh,
a handicap.

937
00:51:12.021 --> 00:51:14.150
She's in a wheelchair and there was something mentally wrong with her.

938
00:51:14.151 --> 00:51:15.920
She was stemming,
she was rocking.

939
00:51:16.010 --> 00:51:19.820
She was pulling her hair and crying because there were three TSA agents trying

940
00:51:19.821 --> 00:51:24.280
to tell her to lift her arms so they can swab her clothes,
swab her wheelchair,

941
00:51:24.290 --> 00:51:27.410
the back pad,
the tires,
the wheels,
everything.

942
00:51:27.590 --> 00:51:29.990
Her Dad is there on the brink.

943
00:51:29.991 --> 00:51:33.170
You can imagine how traumatic it is to try to bring somebody in a special needs

944
00:51:33.171 --> 00:51:35.030
child through an airport in general.

945
00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:38.180
But now they've been selected for special screening and he has to try to explain

946
00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:40.910
to his daughter who was having a fit.
Rightfully so,

947
00:51:41.210 --> 00:51:44.720
and strangers are groping her and Swiping,
swabbing her seat.

948
00:51:44.810 --> 00:51:46.970
He's trying to calm her down.
Well,
you know,

949
00:51:46.971 --> 00:51:49.970
by holding an iPad and her face and doing whatever he can to get her to relax.

950
00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:52.580
Do I have to lift her out of the seat?
He asked.
Yes you do.

951
00:51:52.670 --> 00:51:55.790
He's trying to lift her up.
She's fighting it.
My heart is breaking for this guy.

952
00:51:55.970 --> 00:51:59.330
The reason I'm sitting in this glass box is because after my pat down,

953
00:51:59.331 --> 00:52:02.150
they ran my little piece of cloth or they ran the gloves and the piece of cloth

954
00:52:02.151 --> 00:52:05.780
that they swiped the bottom of my feet with through a machine.
By the way,

955
00:52:05.781 --> 00:52:06.440
machines would we,

956
00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:09.860
which we spent more than $30 million on to install an airports in this machine.

957
00:52:09.861 --> 00:52:13.520
Said I tested positive for nitrates.
I had that will happen one.
Yeah,

958
00:52:13.521 --> 00:52:17.390
and I pulled up.
So what's a nitrate?
Well,
sir,
it's a,
you know,
that can be used.

959
00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:20.270
It's a chemical.
Okay.
What does that mean?
Well,

960
00:52:20.271 --> 00:52:22.550
it's a chemical be used in a lot of things.
It doesn't,
this isn't,

961
00:52:22.570 --> 00:52:25.310
it's not a bad thing.
It's not a bad thing.
I'm like,
this isn't a problem.

962
00:52:25.311 --> 00:52:25.701
And I go,
no,

963
00:52:25.701 --> 00:52:28.820
it is a problem because I have a flight to catch and I want to know like why I'm

964
00:52:28.821 --> 00:52:31.330
being detained longer.
While you're tested positive for nitrates,

965
00:52:31.350 --> 00:52:34.730
we have to give you a,
an even more thorough screening.
Okay,

966
00:52:34.820 --> 00:52:38.150
well what else can test positive for nitrates?
Guy Couldn't answer it.

967
00:52:38.151 --> 00:52:41.060
Second person couldn't answer it.
Third Person says Q if you had been to a farm.

968
00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:44.810
No they did not.
But the third guy finally said,
well the,
the head of the,

969
00:52:44.820 --> 00:52:46.010
the security mob there said,

970
00:52:46.100 --> 00:52:48.530
well if you've walked on grass that has fertilizer on it,

971
00:52:48.531 --> 00:52:50.090
then you might test positive for nitrates.

972
00:52:50.210 --> 00:52:54.050
Even a certain heart medications that seniors take tests positive for nitrates.

973
00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:56.150
So I'm now stuck in a glass box,

974
00:52:56.180 --> 00:53:01.180
detached from my valuables watching this poor girl having a meltdown as these

975
00:53:01.281 --> 00:53:04.070
three people are going to love her and I start to cry because it just,

976
00:53:04.190 --> 00:53:05.780
it breaks my heart that this is happening.

977
00:53:05.781 --> 00:53:08.540
This poor guy is having to go through this and I,
you know,

978
00:53:08.541 --> 00:53:11.120
I go to put my hand on a shoulder and tell him like,
I'm sorry,

979
00:53:11.121 --> 00:53:13.730
you have to go through this.
And he looks back and he's choked up.
I mean,

980
00:53:13.731 --> 00:53:17.180
he's been in there for a good 15 minutes trying to calm down his daughter.

981
00:53:17.540 --> 00:53:19.820
So then I start questioning,
why are you guys doing this?

982
00:53:19.850 --> 00:53:23.090
And I'm being polite and being calm,
being everything you could possibly be.
Well,

983
00:53:23.091 --> 00:53:25.650
asking how much longer this is going to take because I have a to catch.

984
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:29.310
They grab my belongings and start walking them away and it go,
excuse me.

985
00:53:29.311 --> 00:53:30.001
What are you doing?
Like you're,

986
00:53:30.001 --> 00:53:32.190
you're coming here to this private screening room?
No,
no,
no.

987
00:53:32.191 --> 00:53:33.270
I don't want to be in a private screening room.

988
00:53:33.271 --> 00:53:37.470
I want this enhanced pat down to happen right here because I want my girlfriend

989
00:53:37.471 --> 00:53:39.300
to videotape it.
Well,
no,
no,
no sir.

990
00:53:39.301 --> 00:53:42.570
You're going by this time my belongings are in the frosted glass private

991
00:53:42.571 --> 00:53:43.404
screening room.

992
00:53:43.650 --> 00:53:46.380
Now I'm in the private screening room with them and there's a giant placard that

993
00:53:46.381 --> 00:53:50.740
says,
this is a private security room.
There was no filming whatsoever.
If a train,

994
00:53:50.850 --> 00:53:54.390
if a TSA employee tells you to stop filming,
you must seats filling immediately.

995
00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:58.230
You do have the right to call in a witness to be there.
And I'm thinking,

996
00:53:58.470 --> 00:54:01.580
why can't the camera be my witness?
Because if I'm traveling alone,

997
00:54:01.650 --> 00:54:04.920
who else am I gonna call fucking Ghostbusters?
And they gonna Bring Tsa in here.

998
00:54:05.060 --> 00:54:07.320
So when I'm in a glass box with two dudes by myself,

999
00:54:07.380 --> 00:54:10.020
he swabs me down with the gloves and then he says,
I'll be right back.

1000
00:54:10.021 --> 00:54:11.880
I have to test this glove goes,

1001
00:54:11.970 --> 00:54:16.560
puts his hand on the handle of the door with the glove on it that he just wiped

1002
00:54:16.561 --> 00:54:19.080
me down,
opens it up and walks out on his merry way.

1003
00:54:19.470 --> 00:54:21.300
So I looked to the other guy who's left in the room.
I'm like,

1004
00:54:21.301 --> 00:54:24.480
what the fuck was that?
And it was like the first time I had cursed and he goes,

1005
00:54:24.481 --> 00:54:27.000
what do you mean?
I'm like,
he just swapped my body down with that glove.

1006
00:54:27.001 --> 00:54:28.140
Then grabbed the handle.

1007
00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:32.700
If someone in her earlier did have explosives on them and he grabbed that handle

1008
00:54:32.701 --> 00:54:35.760
with that glove.
That's now on my test.
Why is any testing right here?

1009
00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:38.910
There's a machine in the room.
Oh Sir.
That that machine's calibration is off.

1010
00:54:38.911 --> 00:54:41.760
That's why it's here.
Uh,
it happened in the room cause the calibration is off.

1011
00:54:41.761 --> 00:54:44.190
Yeah,
there's a tag on it that says it needs to be serviced.
Okay.

1012
00:54:44.430 --> 00:54:47.880
So I'm waiting five minutes go by.
I'd strike up conversation with the guy.

1013
00:54:47.881 --> 00:54:50.490
I hate that that little girl out there in the wheelchair that's having the fit

1014
00:54:50.491 --> 00:54:53.370
and I can still hear her having a poor meltdown out there.

1015
00:54:53.580 --> 00:54:57.990
Why are they out there?
Well he tested positive for nitrates as well.
Oh he did?

1016
00:54:58.080 --> 00:55:01.620
Yeah.
Why is the girl there?
Oh she tested positive for nitrates.
Oh.

1017
00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:04.980
So all three of us have tested positive for nitrates with the one machine that's

1018
00:55:04.981 --> 00:55:05.311
out there.

1019
00:55:05.311 --> 00:55:08.460
You've got another one in here that need servicing and recalibration and you

1020
00:55:08.461 --> 00:55:11.060
think there's nothing wrong with this situation.
Guy Comes back,

1021
00:55:11.070 --> 00:55:11.881
tells me I'm clear.

1022
00:55:11.881 --> 00:55:15.540
I leave the room and I see the father is still there struggling with his

1023
00:55:15.541 --> 00:55:19.050
daughter and I'm like,
I'm again like moved to tears.
And I asked this guy,

1024
00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:21.510
tell me as a human being,
do you think this is right?

1025
00:55:21.511 --> 00:55:25.170
Do you think this treatment for this poor girl is right?
And he goes,
sir,

1026
00:55:25.171 --> 00:55:28.620
she tested positive for nitrates and went right.
I get that.

1027
00:55:29.010 --> 00:55:32.850
But there are many other countries who deal with terrorism on a far greater

1028
00:55:32.851 --> 00:55:37.530
level than we do who have far more swifter and more and more common sense

1029
00:55:37.531 --> 00:55:40.290
approach to security that doesn't demean their citizenry.

1030
00:55:40.291 --> 00:55:42.810
That doesn't cost them millions of taxpayer dollars.

1031
00:55:43.410 --> 00:55:45.900
Do you think that that's right,
that that girl is having a meltdown,

1032
00:55:45.901 --> 00:55:47.760
you're swabbing her wheelchair,
do you really think she's a terrorist?

1033
00:55:47.910 --> 00:55:49.200
I'm just asking you as a human being.

1034
00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:51.690
And there was a long pause and he sort of looked down and looked at his shoes

1035
00:55:51.691 --> 00:55:54.240
and I thought,
good,
I'm finally going to have a moment,

1036
00:55:54.241 --> 00:55:57.870
a real moment here as a human being is going to take off that TSA helmet for a

1037
00:55:57.871 --> 00:55:58.141
second.

1038
00:55:58.141 --> 00:56:01.320
And he looked up and looked me right in the eyes and said she tested positive

1039
00:56:01.321 --> 00:56:05.580
for nitrates and that's when I realized this is a,
this is a lost cause.

1040
00:56:05.581 --> 00:56:06.414
This is a losing battle here.

1041
00:56:06.540 --> 00:56:07.830
<v 0>What a Burger King employee.</v>

1042
00:56:08.580 --> 00:56:11.460
I used to joke about it that I think that the people who work at security and

1043
00:56:11.461 --> 00:56:14.160
the people that work at Burger King or like the same people,

1044
00:56:14.161 --> 00:56:19.050
it's just a reached a hand into a bucket.
Well,
you today,
oh,
I got fries.
Damn,

1045
00:56:19.051 --> 00:56:20.280
I got bombed control.

1046
00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:23.650
<v 1>Yup.
I'm on foot swabbing or I'm on rubbing beltline.</v>

1047
00:56:24.550 --> 00:56:28.390
Here's my security.
Today is I,
dude,
I hate mopping that fucking floor.

1048
00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:32.620
I'm all for people having jobs,
but we need repair infrastructure.

1049
00:56:32.650 --> 00:56:34.270
Run after school programs.

1050
00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:39.010
Do something that benefits your community and society more than this.
I see.

1051
00:56:39.011 --> 00:56:41.650
I think that we need security of Europe.
We just,

1052
00:56:41.651 --> 00:56:46.540
because there's been so many instances in the past of people using airplanes,

1053
00:56:47.140 --> 00:56:48.400
hijacking airplanes.

1054
00:56:48.670 --> 00:56:51.940
I believe that reinforcing of the doors was the best thing that happened.

1055
00:56:51.970 --> 00:56:55.300
That was the one security measure that said,
look,
we know we're now as a society.

1056
00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:58.330
No one will ever hijack a plane again if it's sourced in America.

1057
00:56:58.331 --> 00:56:59.140
If it's one out of here,

1058
00:56:59.140 --> 00:57:02.620
everybody in that cabin will fight and die to make sure that plane doesn't get

1059
00:57:02.621 --> 00:57:06.100
hijacked and air marshals to,
I think Eric Schlosser important too.

1060
00:57:06.101 --> 00:57:09.190
I think it's good to have a guy up there is an actual bad motherfucker who knows

1061
00:57:09.191 --> 00:57:10.270
how to take care of Shit.

1062
00:57:10.270 --> 00:57:14.230
If some wacky motherfucker tries to blow his shoes up and some people even make

1063
00:57:14.231 --> 00:57:15.070
the argument by the way,

1064
00:57:15.071 --> 00:57:18.550
that that gun's on planes would have stopped some of nine 11 that if someone

1065
00:57:18.551 --> 00:57:20.080
actually had a gun on that flight,
you know,

1066
00:57:20.081 --> 00:57:22.900
in the risk of a bullet going through and that sudden loss of cabin pressure is

1067
00:57:22.901 --> 00:57:24.910
overrated.
I don't know that I subscribed to that,

1068
00:57:24.911 --> 00:57:26.920
but I could see how that's a valid argument.

1069
00:57:26.921 --> 00:57:30.190
I could see how someone could make that.
We do need security,
but the,
the,

1070
00:57:30.191 --> 00:57:34.120
the leaps and bounds that we've gone to are inefficient.
They don't work.

1071
00:57:34.180 --> 00:57:36.640
It's costing us millions and millions of dollars.
The company,

1072
00:57:37.210 --> 00:57:40.930
the companies suck and they're dealing with gigantic numbers of employees

1073
00:57:40.931 --> 00:57:45.490
because they have these setups at every God damn airport and every God damn city

1074
00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:48.970
all over this country.
There's a lot of fucking airports.

1075
00:57:49.330 --> 00:57:52.660
So there's no way they're really paying attention and monitoring it at all.

1076
00:57:52.660 --> 00:57:55.900
A really intense level and looking at it like how can we make this a better

1077
00:57:55.901 --> 00:57:59.050
experience for the people except for like those things where you go and you,

1078
00:57:59.190 --> 00:58:04.090
you put your name in and you get scanned and then he'd go through pre like Tsa

1079
00:58:04.091 --> 00:58:08.680
pre like the blue where the clear programs now that,
and now that I have another,

1080
00:58:08.681 --> 00:58:09.710
another issue with that,

1081
00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:12.850
because sometimes you have to pay more to now they're creating another tiered

1082
00:58:12.851 --> 00:58:15.240
society where the haves don't get,

1083
00:58:15.250 --> 00:58:18.670
have the inconvenience on hate on the 1% dude just because they want to get

1084
00:58:18.671 --> 00:58:21.760
through the airport.
Me One of the guys that can afford the premium tickets.

1085
00:58:21.761 --> 00:58:24.610
So I get through the TSA like I'm,
I'm blessed,
I live a good life.

1086
00:58:26.530 --> 00:58:28.760
Listen,
listen motherfucker,

1087
00:58:29.530 --> 00:58:32.300
I'm blessed and show me the keys to your car.
Yeah.

1088
00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:36.610
The keys to the kingdom is maybe a seven.
I love it.
Oh my God.
Nice car.
Thank you.

1089
00:58:36.611 --> 00:58:40.360
I love it.
Wow.
What space ship.
That's a space and the technology in it.

1090
00:58:40.361 --> 00:58:42.430
Like I need some pretty close to a car that drives itself.

1091
00:58:42.431 --> 00:58:44.140
Like I don't touch the gas pedal anymore.
Yeah.

1092
00:58:44.141 --> 00:58:46.750
This is the Audi a seven which they passed today by the way.

1093
00:58:46.751 --> 00:58:51.490
Self driving cars and cars.
Let's do it.
Awesome.
But even with the old cars,

1094
00:58:51.491 --> 00:58:53.900
mine has the adaptive cruise where you pressed the button,

1095
00:58:53.940 --> 00:58:57.340
it'll automatically stay with,
you know,
it'll match pace with the car in Florida.

1096
00:58:57.460 --> 00:58:59.950
So I don't really even on surface streets,
like city streets,

1097
00:59:00.460 --> 00:59:02.170
I don't really touch the gas pedal.
I get it up to speed,

1098
00:59:02.171 --> 00:59:06.490
hit a button and I kind of,
yeah,
it's easier to send tweets that way.
Oh.

1099
00:59:06.491 --> 00:59:10.780
And s but there has been,
there has been a time or two where I will,

1100
00:59:10.810 --> 00:59:13.300
I'm just kind of zoning out.
I'm not using my phone,
but I am like,

1101
00:59:13.301 --> 00:59:15.910
oh the car's driving itself and all of a sudden bleeding.

1102
00:59:15.911 --> 00:59:17.500
And they had the heads up display.

1103
00:59:17.501 --> 00:59:20.680
So it puts my miles per hour and my turn by turn,
like on the windshield,

1104
00:59:20.681 --> 00:59:21.980
like you're seeing it out through there.

1105
00:59:22.190 --> 00:59:24.260
<v 3>It turns bright red and it's like warning collision.</v>

1106
00:59:24.270 --> 00:59:28.130
So I have to slam on the breaks and I'm like fucking r two d two fell asleep at

1107
00:59:28.131 --> 00:59:30.980
my wheel.
Fucking short circuit was not paying attention.

1108
00:59:30.981 --> 00:59:33.410
I almost slammed into the car and for them someone just get in front of you

1109
00:59:33.411 --> 00:59:35.480
really quick?
No,
I mean we've just casually going,

1110
00:59:35.481 --> 00:59:38.690
I mean it's much safer to use those systems on a highway where there might not

1111
00:59:38.691 --> 00:59:41.410
be so much start and stop.
Oh,
so it hiccups but I,
yeah,

1112
00:59:41.710 --> 00:59:43.100
I mean it's sometimes it's a little lax.

1113
00:59:43.101 --> 00:59:46.070
I'm sure it's busy processing my Bluetooth audio and goes,
Oh shit,

1114
00:59:46.071 --> 00:59:48.260
you're driving.
It has the switch over to that.

1115
00:59:48.580 --> 00:59:52.730
My favorite car that I have is my Porsche because it's beautiful.
The race car,

1116
00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:55.040
the GT three because it doesn't have anything in it.

1117
00:59:55.150 --> 00:59:58.710
It has navigation with the navigation says it had seats in the back.
No,
no,

1118
00:59:58.750 --> 01:00:00.650
she's exactly,
it has nothing.
And then not only that,

1119
01:00:00.651 --> 01:00:04.010
it's like it doesn't do anything.
Like there's no heads up display.
There's no,

1120
01:00:04.011 --> 01:00:08.510
it's just mechanical.
It's just a machine.
And you shift the gears yourself.

1121
01:00:08.570 --> 01:00:08.960
You don't,

1122
01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:12.110
you don't allow the thing to stop and break for you to say like the exact

1123
01:00:12.140 --> 01:00:15.710
opposite.
But that does get tiring for a lot of people.
Especially dude,

1124
01:00:15.711 --> 01:00:18.710
I got to browse reddit.
Like I don't have time to shift gears.

1125
01:00:18.711 --> 01:00:20.060
I got to catch up on my news.

1126
01:00:20.061 --> 01:00:22.610
Do you realize you're joking around about that but you really shouldn't.

1127
01:00:22.730 --> 01:00:23.141
I don't want,

1128
01:00:23.141 --> 01:00:26.000
I don't really look when you're shown you in your car now and no one,

1129
01:00:26.030 --> 01:00:29.900
no one should live out rape fantasies either.
Some girls like that though.

1130
01:00:29.901 --> 01:00:31.070
I don't think anybody likes running.

1131
01:00:31.071 --> 01:00:35.270
So overall drive cause they were tweeting while driving.
Yeah.
It's uh,

1132
01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:37.250
eventually it's going to be really smooth.

1133
01:00:37.251 --> 01:00:39.890
We are going to be able to accomplish that stuff as you're driving.

1134
01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:41.420
But I don't even trust people to you.

1135
01:00:41.421 --> 01:00:43.730
Do you even pull the largest pass for self driving cars?

1136
01:00:43.731 --> 01:00:46.120
How do you feel about that?
And California,
they're street legal.

1137
01:00:46.121 --> 01:00:47.970
It's been effective.
They've been using it in,

1138
01:00:47.980 --> 01:00:51.320
Google's been using it for quite a while.
You could,
you could find it online.

1139
01:00:51.350 --> 01:00:52.700
The only known collision,

1140
01:00:52.701 --> 01:00:55.460
or at least like six months ago when I was reading about it,

1141
01:00:55.461 --> 01:00:58.520
the only known collision and one of those Google self driving cars was when the

1142
01:00:58.521 --> 01:01:01.040
operator took it out of self-drive node was manually driving it,

1143
01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:03.980
but he still had to document it because it was a collision with a car.
Well,

1144
01:01:03.981 --> 01:01:07.700
I think that I enjoy driving.
I enjoy the experience of,

1145
01:01:07.740 --> 01:01:11.630
of shifting my own gears.
I think I look at like when you have a,

1146
01:01:11.631 --> 01:01:16.190
a fun car,
like the,
the Gt three driving becomes like a ride.

1147
01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:19.870
I took a ride home.
Right.
But not when you have a commute.
Yeah.
That's not fun.

1148
01:01:19.871 --> 01:01:23.210
Like shifting gears when you're stopped on the four oh five and holding in a

1149
01:01:23.211 --> 01:01:24.650
clutch.
Yeah.
That's shitty.

1150
01:01:24.710 --> 01:01:29.360
And so to let my car drive and maybe free me up to do an extra hours productive

1151
01:01:29.361 --> 01:01:31.880
work or focus on my book on tape and my mind,

1152
01:01:31.881 --> 01:01:36.650
my audible.com/joe download to focus on that.
That makes sense to me.

1153
01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:40.070
Oh totally.
But you know,
it doesn't make sense.
That kind of traffic.
Do you see?

1154
01:01:40.071 --> 01:01:43.250
We got a fuck nights.
We can figure out that it's not gossip here anytime soon.

1155
01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:46.580
I am going to disappear.
I'm not going to live like this my whole life.

1156
01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:49.670
I tried escaping me.
Go to the mound and try again.
I don't know.

1157
01:01:49.671 --> 01:01:50.970
I'm thinking maybe Santa Barbara.
I'm,

1158
01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:53.660
I might try Santa Barbara for a while cause it's only like an hour live in the

1159
01:01:53.661 --> 01:01:55.370
zoo.
You're going to have them,
you a,

1160
01:01:55.430 --> 01:01:58.830
you should have them build you a little cabin and the chip bums me out.

1161
01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.160
We might be living in a fucking zoo.
How about that pal?

1162
01:02:01.340 --> 01:02:02.930
How about this whole planet might be a zoo.

1163
01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:05.810
Look at this robot guy with as Google glass.
Oh my God,

1164
01:02:05.811 --> 01:02:08.770
it creates bars.

1165
01:02:08.810 --> 01:02:12.440
And did you check out black mirror by the way?
You guys look at that shit.

1166
01:02:12.441 --> 01:02:16.200
Did you watch that?
No,
no,
no,
no.
So many things to Montana.

1167
01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:19.380
But I did see the little Wayne deposition.

1168
01:02:20.450 --> 01:02:22.460
You just see that the one that's been making zero,

1169
01:02:22.750 --> 01:02:27.720
Brian thought to pull it up because I just became a little Wayne Fan.
Oh,

1170
01:02:27.721 --> 01:02:30.990
me too.
I was not a little Wayne fan up until this.
I loved that.

1171
01:02:31.050 --> 01:02:33.540
It wasn't that Chappelle skit of I plead the fifth.
Yeah.

1172
01:02:33.541 --> 01:02:35.790
And I'm thinking of getting a little Wayne Tattoo.

1173
01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:39.730
That's how bad ass this dude is.
Yeah,
man,
he's good.

1174
01:02:39.930 --> 01:02:44.160
He's suing these people because they made a documentary about him and apparently

1175
01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:46.650
has a lot of false information according to Mr Wayne.

1176
01:02:47.310 --> 01:02:51.240
And so they asked him a bunch of stupid questions at this deposition,

1177
01:02:51.241 --> 01:02:54.870
but the way he answered it was beautiful.
It was hilarious.

1178
01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:59.410
The veiled threat,
which many have donated say don't even say,

1179
01:02:59.420 --> 01:03:00.800
I don't want to spoil it.
We we're going to play it.

1180
01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:03.033
<v 5>Hm.</v>

1181
01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:07.010
<v 3>It happened just a couple of days ago.</v>

1182
01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:11.900
It's pretty great and it's hard to get without the Worldstar hip hop.
Uh,

1183
01:03:12.820 --> 01:03:15.830
that is my new homepage.
What does that,
the watermark.
Watermarks.

1184
01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:18.530
I love me some world star hip hop.
Yeah.
That's my problem.

1185
01:03:18.590 --> 01:03:22.700
If you go to my computer and you type in WWE in the browser,
it just goes,

1186
01:03:24.530 --> 01:03:26.540
he knows I want to see some fucked up.

1187
01:03:26.950 --> 01:03:29.930
Why are you going to watch that Kanye sex tape when it leaks on that site?

1188
01:03:30.020 --> 01:03:34.100
Is there two of them?
Two of them.
Kanye West has sex tapes.

1189
01:03:34.101 --> 01:03:38.570
Jeezy really?
There's a rumor that one of them is with that,
with the Kardashians,

1190
01:03:38.571 --> 01:03:40.450
but apparently it's a look a like girl from there.

1191
01:03:40.451 --> 01:03:43.160
Do they have a video of her from some booty shaking contest,
which I love it.

1192
01:03:43.161 --> 01:03:46.670
That he competitive sport.
Is he doing this on purpose releasing these?
Uh,

1193
01:03:46.700 --> 01:03:50.300
he's apparently offered millions of dollars to stop the release,
so I don't,

1194
01:03:50.301 --> 01:03:50.840
I don't know.

1195
01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:55.300
I doubt at his level at this point while the girls were releasing it,
no,

1196
01:03:55.310 --> 01:03:58.670
I think there were stolen off of his computer stolen,
stolen,
which,

1197
01:03:58.671 --> 01:04:01.580
who knows if someone that physically stole them or hacked in or whatever.

1198
01:04:01.581 --> 01:04:04.940
But that's,
that's what I read.
Is this it?
Oh,
animal practice.

1199
01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:06.540
It's watching Bobby Lee.

1200
01:04:09.430 --> 01:04:12.340
<v 6>How would you describe your image in the media?</v>

1201
01:04:13.570 --> 01:04:17.770
How would I describe my image in the media?
Yes,
I wouldn't describe it.

1202
01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:24.220
Well,
how would you describe it if you had to?
I don't have to.
Well,

1203
01:04:24.221 --> 01:04:28.390
what do you make sure you portrayed in the media?
I don't portray anything.

1204
01:04:28.391 --> 01:04:33.010
I am who I am.
And you guys portray what you,
again,
who are you?

1205
01:04:33.011 --> 01:04:37.730
Who is the real him?
Dwayne Michael Carter Junior.
Okay.
Do you,
uh,

1206
01:04:39.250 --> 01:04:43.420
like to portray yourself as I just asked at that and said that I don't like to

1207
01:04:43.421 --> 01:04:47.910
portray myself as nobody
be Dwayne,

1208
01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:50.650
Michael Carter,
Johnny.
I don't portray myself as anything.

1209
01:04:50.950 --> 01:04:54.560
An image is self described.
Well you have to wait until I'm done with the quest.

1210
01:04:54.570 --> 01:04:58.970
You don't have to wait to anything.
I honestly,
I,
I mean this guy right here,

1211
01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:03.240
me telling me that I have to wait,
but I don't have to do math.
Go ahead,

1212
01:05:03.250 --> 01:05:07.390
ask the question.
Your honor.
Do you like to save you?

1213
01:05:07.391 --> 01:05:12.280
Right in the real world,
that guy right there,
he can't save you in the railroad.

1214
01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:16.270
She's just like,
what does that mean?
I don't have to elaborate.

1215
01:05:17.770 --> 01:05:18.470
Okay.

1216
01:05:18.470 --> 01:05:23.220
<v 3>Is that your next question?
Is that a threat against,
I miss noticed that.</v>

1217
01:05:23.230 --> 01:05:25.090
Can you just ask your next question please.

1218
01:05:28.530 --> 01:05:33.460
Progression of time.
The hoodie is off.
He can't save you

1219
01:05:36.130 --> 01:05:38.460
and what does that mean?
I was talking to myself.

1220
01:05:41.380 --> 01:05:45.720
Oh my God,
he can't save you in the real world.
Oh my God,
this,

1221
01:05:46.180 --> 01:05:50.170
he's a beautiful human being.
Great.
Fuck you to that lawyer.

1222
01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:51.490
That was beautiful.
Yeah,

1223
01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:55.570
that was big because that guy was talking to him in that like weird formal speak

1224
01:05:55.571 --> 01:05:58.960
that you have to do if you'd give a deposition.
Right.
That's like not human.

1225
01:05:59.020 --> 01:06:01.600
It's like,
it's weird.
It does it.
It takes,

1226
01:06:01.601 --> 01:06:05.360
it's almost like removing a lot of context or moving a lot of,

1227
01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:09.680
they speak like text messages.
There's no emotion,
there's no context.
It's just,

1228
01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:09.970
it's,

1229
01:06:09.970 --> 01:06:13.820
it's a legal document flowing out of someone's mouth because he's writing the

1230
01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:17.260
question,
these transcribing it as he goes,
it needs to sound legally correct.

1231
01:06:17.290 --> 01:06:17.411
Well,

1232
01:06:17.411 --> 01:06:21.310
I thought it was brilliant that he was trying to get a little Wayne to define

1233
01:06:21.311 --> 01:06:23.680
himself.
Right,
and what bullshit question.
Yeah.

1234
01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:27.280
How would you describe the media's portrayal?
I wouldn't.
I wouldn't.

1235
01:06:27.281 --> 01:06:31.690
And it also depends what site,
what outlet you don't have.

1236
01:06:31.691 --> 01:06:36.070
Would you describe the media's portrayal of you,
Joe?
A fear factor guy.
Really?

1237
01:06:36.140 --> 01:06:38.980
You think that's still,
that's still the case.
The UFC guy,
maybe.

1238
01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:41.500
Maybe the UFC guy.
He had a little midget me that,

1239
01:06:42.580 --> 01:06:44.590
but doesn't it depend on what outlet?
Yeah.

1240
01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:47.080
Well it depends on whether they like you and they don't like him exist.
Sure.

1241
01:06:47.230 --> 01:06:49.570
For sure.
It depends on whether or not they have a motivation.

1242
01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:53.440
I think it's pretty clear at this point that what you're getting in the news is

1243
01:06:53.441 --> 01:06:57.130
not just the information of all the things.
It's happening all over the world.

1244
01:06:57.400 --> 01:07:01.870
It's,
they have an agenda.
Right.
And if their agenda is to mock you,
uh,
you know,

1245
01:07:01.871 --> 01:07:04.420
if you were a celebrity who they love,

1246
01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:08.680
they might talk about you and glowing terms or if you're a celebrity,

1247
01:07:08.700 --> 01:07:12.240
you get arrested because you slammed your SUV into a pole while doing rails and

1248
01:07:12.241 --> 01:07:14.820
cocaine.
It's like,
no,
no,
they wouldn't then,
then,

1249
01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:17.950
then they always talk down on you.
But I'm saying it depends on the celebrity.

1250
01:07:17.951 --> 01:07:20.020
You could be like a person,
like,
uh,

1251
01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:22.780
like Jennifer Lopez is getting married and that's a piece of news.

1252
01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:26.770
Or You could be like,
Lindsay Lohan crashed her car again,
I think.

1253
01:07:26.860 --> 01:07:31.240
And well I think it does depend on the celebrity cause I think like what Gibson

1254
01:07:31.241 --> 01:07:34.690
had another,
oops see today on the side of the road because they hate that guy.

1255
01:07:34.691 --> 01:07:35.500
That guy's done.

1256
01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:38.290
But there are some celebrities that they treat the kid gloves because they're

1257
01:07:38.291 --> 01:07:41.020
worried they won't sit down for the next junket to promote their movie.

1258
01:07:41.110 --> 01:07:43.660
I don't think there's a bit,
I don't think anymore,
man.

1259
01:07:43.661 --> 01:07:45.490
I really don't think too many people get,
like,

1260
01:07:45.491 --> 01:07:48.340
I've worked in it too much to know what people will say and won't say because

1261
01:07:48.341 --> 01:07:49.210
they're afraid they'll lose it.

1262
01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:54.280
Feel like when you get like a certain level of fucked up at Nesto drunk driving,

1263
01:07:55.140 --> 01:07:58.810
you drown in a barrel.
All bets are off.
But there are some,

1264
01:07:58.900 --> 01:08:03.010
they'll forgive some celebrities and they'll forgive some personalities if they

1265
01:08:03.011 --> 01:08:06.000
feel like later on it might be,
it might benefit them or if they're worried,

1266
01:08:06.001 --> 01:08:09.190
certainly if they're trying to get more interviews,
right.
Yes.
Yeah.

1267
01:08:09.191 --> 01:08:10.470
They were worried about pulling the thing,

1268
01:08:10.510 --> 01:08:13.330
pulling about d like apple is one of those companies that blogs are afraid to

1269
01:08:13.331 --> 01:08:14.410
write about.
It's a bit of a tangent,

1270
01:08:14.530 --> 01:08:17.330
but they're afraid to write about them in certain negative ways because they're

1271
01:08:17.331 --> 01:08:19.940
worried they won't be allowed into their conference or get an early review unit.

1272
01:08:20.150 --> 01:08:23.970
Right.
That has happened.
They pulled all the,
all the plugs for Gizmodo.

1273
01:08:23.971 --> 01:08:26.960
Once Gizmodo leaked that iPhone,
that iPhone stuff,

1274
01:08:26.961 --> 01:08:29.780
once they got the guy's iPhone from the bar,
Oh,
that's right.
Before they said,

1275
01:08:29.781 --> 01:08:33.050
fuck you Gizmodo.
We'll never get a thing against.
Never get a unit.
To this day,

1276
01:08:33.051 --> 01:08:34.220
they still don't know we can get in there.

1277
01:08:34.221 --> 01:08:38.690
They're not going to forget those grudges.
Wow.
How rude.
Apple Steve Jobs is dead.

1278
01:08:38.691 --> 01:08:42.110
Can't we all just get along?
You fucks.
You get into five.

1279
01:08:42.111 --> 01:08:47.111
What's this black mirror black mirror violently on this last podcast and

1280
01:08:47.391 --> 01:08:50.680
everybody was like,
thank you so much for introducing me to this.
There's,

1281
01:08:50.681 --> 01:08:54.260
this is just one of the episodes here.
There it is the best.

1282
01:08:54.290 --> 01:08:55.760
It's a channel four mini series.

1283
01:08:55.761 --> 01:08:58.310
I don't need to Belabor it because I did it last time.
And what's it about again,

1284
01:08:58.340 --> 01:09:02.810
it's about like near future societal issues that will come about because of the

1285
01:09:02.811 --> 01:09:05.480
rapid changing pace of technology.
That is the,

1286
01:09:05.481 --> 01:09:09.560
that is the seed that that sprouts each of the three episodes and they're all

1287
01:09:09.561 --> 01:09:11.300
completely different.
Completely different aesthetics,

1288
01:09:11.301 --> 01:09:13.880
completely different directors,
but they're all fascinating.

1289
01:09:13.970 --> 01:09:18.050
They're phenomenally written.
Interesting that we're talking about it as like,

1290
01:09:18.130 --> 01:09:21.980
like problems in the future.
It's really not problems were the problem.

1291
01:09:22.250 --> 01:09:26.690
The reality is the assimilation is the societal issues because like we were

1292
01:09:26.691 --> 01:09:29.290
talking about Google glasses,
right?
When you have the ability to,

1293
01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:32.690
to life of log when the devices light enough,
powerful enough,

1294
01:09:32.691 --> 01:09:35.300
cheap enough and easy enough to,
I record 24 hours here,

1295
01:09:35.301 --> 01:09:37.520
whatever I see and I can play it back like that.

1296
01:09:37.670 --> 01:09:40.130
That's what one of the issues or one of the episodes is about.

1297
01:09:40.131 --> 01:09:44.270
So you watch a couple try to navigate a relationship where every moment is

1298
01:09:44.271 --> 01:09:46.040
fucking recorded.
So he's like,

1299
01:09:46.070 --> 01:09:49.400
I want to see what happened June 12th when you were with that guy at 3:00 PM

1300
01:09:49.490 --> 01:09:53.210
show me that moment.
Pull it up.
You know,
she's frantically trying to delete it.

1301
01:09:53.300 --> 01:09:55.160
Hey,
when we had that argument two hours ago,

1302
01:09:55.161 --> 01:09:58.550
you said this and it really upset me.
I didn't say it like that.
Oh yeah,
boom.

1303
01:09:58.551 --> 01:10:01.520
Pull that moment and look at it.
That's a shoe that will happen.

1304
01:10:01.580 --> 01:10:05.750
There's a commercial that they were running really recently about a dash cam.

1305
01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:10.250
They sell dash cams now.
So,
uh,
the guy pulls over someone and he's like,

1306
01:10:10.251 --> 01:10:13.490
this is a re re enactment of an actual accident in New York City.

1307
01:10:13.790 --> 01:10:15.950
And the woman goes,
this guy hit me.

1308
01:10:16.130 --> 01:10:19.070
And the guy goes up to the cop and says,

1309
01:10:19.310 --> 01:10:22.130
would you like me to tell you what happened?
Or show you what happened?

1310
01:10:22.430 --> 01:10:23.450
And the cops have,
what do you mean?
He goes,

1311
01:10:23.451 --> 01:10:26.120
I have a dashboard camera and it shows them the camera and clearly shows the

1312
01:10:26.121 --> 01:10:29.000
woman hitting him.
Right?
So he goes,
ma'am,
let me just tell you,

1313
01:10:29.001 --> 01:10:32.950
that line to an officer is,
you know,
a crime.
Do you want to go to jail?

1314
01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:36.380
Tell him the truth.
And she is okay.
I hit him.
Yeah.
I pull.

1315
01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:40.010
If you search for a Russia search for Russian Dash Cam or Russian Insurance

1316
01:10:40.011 --> 01:10:44.220
Fraud Dash Cam,
hold on.
Is that bad?
What?
Cause the same size.

1317
01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:47.240
The guys protected from accidental.
That seems good.

1318
01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:51.590
And maybe like a cop beating your ass.
That's,
that's another possibility.
I,

1319
01:10:51.630 --> 01:10:54.680
some cop was having a hard day decides to kick your ass cause he thinks no one's

1320
01:10:54.681 --> 01:10:55.190
watching.

1321
01:10:55.190 --> 01:10:59.420
But I certainly didn't mean to imply that that technology will only lead to

1322
01:10:59.421 --> 01:11:03.050
negative societal consequences.
This mini series just happens to explore them.

1323
01:11:03.051 --> 01:11:04.590
And that was the when you get to release.
Yeah,

1324
01:11:04.650 --> 01:11:08.270
it does it in a beautiful poetic way.
With that said,
I'm a,
I,
you know this,

1325
01:11:08.271 --> 01:11:12.110
I'm a proponent of the,
you know,
the point of singularity now Lord,
I want,

1326
01:11:12.140 --> 01:11:14.220
I want transcendence,
transcendental wisdom.

1327
01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:18.060
<v 1>Like put as much ps plastic.
Put PC parts in me.</v>

1328
01:11:19.820 --> 01:11:21.450
Exactly.
Let's go.
I put it in me.

1329
01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:24.750
I wanted to get RFID chip back when [inaudible] first came out so I could have

1330
01:11:24.751 --> 01:11:28.860
all my,
my,
my credit cards,
my remote entry and my badges to my work.

1331
01:11:28.861 --> 01:11:31.290
I wanted them all to be put in there so I get to swipe my hand.
You know,

1332
01:11:31.291 --> 01:11:35.590
that was one thing that the,
what do you watch and Brian's this an accident.
Yeah.

1333
01:11:35.610 --> 01:11:38.580
I think what happened is this lady backs into a Coppin and get,

1334
01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:40.770
what I'm guessing is that she's going to say something like,

1335
01:11:40.771 --> 01:11:41.910
you ran into the back.

1336
01:11:42.410 --> 01:11:46.560
There are great videos of like people in China and Russia like running at cars

1337
01:11:46.561 --> 01:11:50.100
that are parked in the streets and then leaping onto the hoods and rolling off

1338
01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:53.080
and getting up and going,
oh,
I'm black,
but they're literally charging the car.

1339
01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:57.810
We just sang before Brian showed this video talking about transhumanism,

1340
01:11:57.930 --> 01:12:00.660
about the RFID chip,
where you swipe and how to put into the,

1341
01:12:01.290 --> 01:12:05.880
mythbusters said that that was the one episode that they were not allowed to

1342
01:12:05.881 --> 01:12:08.910
air.
They couldn't do an episode on the RFID chips.

1343
01:12:08.911 --> 01:12:12.240
They were told by their net worth that that was a subject of interest.

1344
01:12:12.241 --> 01:12:14.520
They could not explore you.
What happened with those guys?

1345
01:12:14.521 --> 01:12:15.390
I don't know if you heard the story,

1346
01:12:15.391 --> 01:12:18.610
but they were going to do it and the like the guys behind the RFID tag and chip

1347
01:12:18.611 --> 01:12:19.261
makers said,
yeah,

1348
01:12:19.261 --> 01:12:23.100
we just want to get on the phone with you to discuss the technology and discuss

1349
01:12:23.101 --> 01:12:25.380
the show before we help you out or whatever.

1350
01:12:25.470 --> 01:12:28.980
And so they hopped on the line and on the other side of the line was like 40

1351
01:12:28.981 --> 01:12:32.490
lawyers from credit card companies,
from security firms saying,

1352
01:12:32.491 --> 01:12:36.240
you cannot do this episode.
You cannot talk about RFID.

1353
01:12:36.330 --> 01:12:40.530
It is the most unsecure fucking system in the world.
Absolutely unsecure.

1354
01:12:40.650 --> 01:12:43.110
You can build cheap Pringles can readers for them,

1355
01:12:43.260 --> 01:12:45.900
pull the data right off of them.
You can hack them,
you can clone them.

1356
01:12:46.050 --> 01:12:48.060
There's a good videos of the,
uh,
okay,

1357
01:12:48.090 --> 01:12:51.570
well why don't you explain to everybody who doesn't know what the fuck does RFID

1358
01:12:51.571 --> 01:12:54.960
mean?
It's remote.
I believe it's remote frequency identification.

1359
01:12:54.961 --> 01:12:56.490
It's basically a thing of the chip,

1360
01:12:56.491 --> 01:12:58.770
the size of a grain of rice or sometimes they're like flat.
They're very,

1361
01:12:58.771 --> 01:13:02.850
very low to no power devices that can be passively read.
So if you have a beacon,

1362
01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:05.250
a reader,
they even like the whole thing in your phone,

1363
01:13:05.251 --> 01:13:07.260
they could put it in your clothes on clothes.

1364
01:13:07.261 --> 01:13:09.930
They use it like a security systems in malls when you walk through a reader,

1365
01:13:09.931 --> 01:13:11.760
that's because a lot of them are RFID based.

1366
01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:15.000
It as paying the the product and that sent it off and said,
okay,
this is,

1367
01:13:15.001 --> 01:13:16.650
you know,
a security barrier being reached.

1368
01:13:16.770 --> 01:13:19.080
Those little like credit cards when you tap them to readers.

1369
01:13:19.230 --> 01:13:21.540
A lot of that is RFID.
Some of it is near field communication,

1370
01:13:21.541 --> 01:13:24.060
which is a slightly different standard that's coming about now.

1371
01:13:24.061 --> 01:13:27.840
But there is a lot of RFID swiping for security and buildings that all exists.

1372
01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:31.800
It's been hacked to high heaven.
You can buy RFID readers,

1373
01:13:31.890 --> 01:13:33.210
you can read all the information,

1374
01:13:33.211 --> 01:13:37.470
you can hack it passports that have RFID and I'm now they're very unsafe.
Uh,

1375
01:13:37.471 --> 01:13:40.800
you know,
people pull out your info,
they can clone it,
they can copy it.
You know,

1376
01:13:40.820 --> 01:13:45.450
I am not entirely sure there's great videos of BMWs now being hacked.
Um,

1377
01:13:45.460 --> 01:13:49.630
they sell blank keys that you can code the wireless Keystart on them and there's

1378
01:13:49.650 --> 01:13:52.760
a pretty easy process to just pop it into the car and have it right.

1379
01:13:52.780 --> 01:13:53.730
The new key code to it,

1380
01:13:53.731 --> 01:13:56.340
like a dealer kind of thing and you can start the cars and drive off.

1381
01:13:56.341 --> 01:13:59.790
Now they fixed it sentence and it's not just not just a BMW thing,

1382
01:13:59.791 --> 01:14:02.940
but these guys can be Fred and hacked and that's why they went,

1383
01:14:02.970 --> 01:14:04.470
they didn't want the mythbusters to talk about it.

1384
01:14:04.471 --> 01:14:09.471
Cause we're now building foundations and we're building institutions in our

1385
01:14:09.601 --> 01:14:12.380
daily lives that are,
that are built on

1386
01:14:12.430 --> 01:14:14.020
<v 3>fault,
faulty security premises.</v>

1387
01:14:14.230 --> 01:14:17.500
Like we're all becoming very comfortable with near field communication and

1388
01:14:17.501 --> 01:14:18.340
tapping things and whatever.

1389
01:14:18.341 --> 01:14:21.160
And you have to completely hackable and easily cloned and easily broken.

1390
01:14:21.220 --> 01:14:24.640
Is it something that can be fixed in the future and they don't want to alert

1391
01:14:24.641 --> 01:14:27.820
people before they develop a fix for it?
Well,
I'd look they,

1392
01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:31.460
if they've invested millions of dollars in,
in creating new systems,

1393
01:14:31.461 --> 01:14:34.420
in transitioning their key cards and passports to this technology,

1394
01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:38.500
the last thing they want is a security concern.
But this is an age old problem.

1395
01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:41.110
Security is always an issue.
It's built by a human being.

1396
01:14:41.111 --> 01:14:44.560
It will be broken by a human being.
So there's no really fixing it.

1397
01:14:44.561 --> 01:14:48.310
You can make it stronger,
you can make it smarter.
Sure.
There's no real fixing it.

1398
01:14:48.350 --> 01:14:52.750
Like so the,
the,
the future of the world when,

1399
01:14:52.780 --> 01:14:54.670
when it comes to technology and,

1400
01:14:54.700 --> 01:14:59.700
and it is dependent upon our cooperation because at some point in time we're

1401
01:15:00.881 --> 01:15:05.290
going to all have access to,
to anything.

1402
01:15:05.470 --> 01:15:09.700
Like essentially we're going to all be readable everywhere we go.
Sure.
Yeah.

1403
01:15:09.780 --> 01:15:11.620
All the testing that we're heading that way right now,

1404
01:15:11.650 --> 01:15:16.060
it's almost like it's setting itself up so that no one can ever really,

1405
01:15:16.061 --> 01:15:17.200
truly be in control.

1406
01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:21.040
And that it does have to be a sort of a group decision at the very top because

1407
01:15:21.041 --> 01:15:25.650
at a certain point in time,
like right now,
who's track in what regard?
Like,
well,

1408
01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:29.560
what I'm saying is right now,
if you're looking at technology right now,

1409
01:15:29.580 --> 01:15:33.460
the government's tracking us should they have a gps in your phone.

1410
01:15:33.461 --> 01:15:36.070
So Facebook and apple,
there's gps on your phone.

1411
01:15:36.250 --> 01:15:39.100
The GPS in their phone knows exactly where your location is,

1412
01:15:39.310 --> 01:15:42.310
but at a certain point in time,
I'm going to know where your location is too.

1413
01:15:42.330 --> 01:15:43.180
It's not going to just be,

1414
01:15:43.181 --> 01:15:45.130
the government is going to be anybody who wants to know.

1415
01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:50.110
It's going to get to a point where everything is going to be accessible.

1416
01:15:50.380 --> 01:15:52.300
Well,
we'll accept that for convenience.

1417
01:15:52.330 --> 01:15:55.810
Like there are apps now that allow me to like find my friends or there's a an

1418
01:15:55.811 --> 01:15:59.380
app where I can send you a temporary gps tracking token for my phone.

1419
01:15:59.381 --> 01:16:01.780
So for all trying to meet up at a restaurant or an amusement park,

1420
01:16:01.900 --> 01:16:03.820
you don't have to text me and say,
dude,
where are you?

1421
01:16:03.940 --> 01:16:06.330
You can pull me up on a map and see that I'm five minutes away and it didn't

1422
01:16:06.340 --> 01:16:07.690
give you what street I'm on.

1423
01:16:07.750 --> 01:16:10.900
So we'll accept some of that in the name of convenience,
but fun and fun,

1424
01:16:10.930 --> 01:16:13.450
kind of fun.
It's fun.
Your friend Coachella,
oh,
hey look,

1425
01:16:13.451 --> 01:16:15.490
we're all a little dots running around.
Let's play PAC man game.

1426
01:16:15.491 --> 01:16:17.010
That's really dope actually.
Yeah,
no,

1427
01:16:17.020 --> 01:16:19.000
that will be cool and we'll accept that to an extent,

1428
01:16:19.001 --> 01:16:21.160
but then we will also have privacy controls,

1429
01:16:21.161 --> 01:16:25.060
which a will likely be able to be hacked.
Of course be the government will not,

1430
01:16:25.150 --> 01:16:28.490
they'll ignore those.
They went from Maine.
They fucking will though,
and they say,

1431
01:16:28.660 --> 01:16:31.500
what did you see that they have that apple has a,

1432
01:16:31.550 --> 01:16:35.230
it's a trademark or a patent on a technology that allows the government to

1433
01:16:35.231 --> 01:16:37.690
disable the recording of the phone.
Yes.

1434
01:16:37.740 --> 01:16:40.810
It'll allows people to shut off the phones,

1435
01:16:40.811 --> 01:16:45.811
video capabilities remotely so that you can't Protan a videotape protests or or

1436
01:16:46.460 --> 01:16:48.450
whatnot.
They don't specifically say protest.

1437
01:16:48.451 --> 01:16:52.470
The best reason for it was dirty is what they say.
Why would security,

1438
01:16:52.510 --> 01:16:55.980
why would it ever be in your best interest and not be able to videotape?

1439
01:16:56.050 --> 01:16:59.230
We need a new digital bill of rights that says that if,
by the way,

1440
01:16:59.231 --> 01:17:01.420
let me just say for the record,
that they're,

1441
01:17:01.421 --> 01:17:05.290
the reason for developing this technology is that apple is involved in many

1442
01:17:05.291 --> 01:17:10.160
patent lawsuits and all.
And so when it comes to the ability to record

1443
01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:13.040
<v 1>bands,
the ability,
I mean,
you're getting to a point where,
you know,</v>

1444
01:17:13.041 --> 01:17:16.580
the new phone has eight megapixels,
the fucking video's fantastic.

1445
01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:19.370
You can almost get something that's,
you could,

1446
01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:22.610
you could put out and it would be a really good version of it.

1447
01:17:22.611 --> 01:17:26.690
And the problem with that is you could record people and then put their shit

1448
01:17:26.691 --> 01:17:29.090
online,
right?
So they want to be able to have a concert and say,
well,

1449
01:17:29.091 --> 01:17:31.940
you can't record this concept.
Especially for standup comedians.

1450
01:17:31.941 --> 01:17:33.380
It becomes a real problem when you go,

1451
01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:36.190
you went to town and everybody's now everybody knows your shit.
Yeah.

1452
01:17:36.380 --> 01:17:38.150
So that's apples.

1453
01:17:38.230 --> 01:17:41.570
I ideas that they would set it up so that if there was a concert,

1454
01:17:41.571 --> 01:17:44.390
you couldn't record the concert,
they would shut off there.
But they,
but a,

1455
01:17:44.391 --> 01:17:47.360
I still think that's a huge security concern.
I mean that could,

1456
01:17:47.361 --> 01:17:49.290
that could be a wild security concern.

1457
01:17:49.730 --> 01:17:54.320
It's an awesome move for fucking Samsung because everybody's going to want to go

1458
01:17:54.321 --> 01:17:58.490
android.
Oh yeah,
exactly.
Like fuck this.

1459
01:17:58.491 --> 01:18:00.980
Or they'll build the feature into their phones and then have to pay apple

1460
01:18:00.981 --> 01:18:04.640
millions of dollars once they sue one of the two cap in their work.

1461
01:18:04.700 --> 01:18:07.040
There's a great app,
I,
the name is escaping me,

1462
01:18:07.041 --> 01:18:11.360
but it actually stitches together multiple recordings based off of visual cues

1463
01:18:11.361 --> 01:18:15.170
and like audio,
like wave forms and Tom Codes.
So if you're at a concert,

1464
01:18:15.171 --> 01:18:17.900
if you're out of Coachella and there's 40 people in the crowd that are filming

1465
01:18:17.901 --> 01:18:18.711
it with their Iphones,

1466
01:18:18.711 --> 01:18:22.670
they can all upload their video and it will stitch those angles together as best

1467
01:18:22.671 --> 01:18:26.270
as it can.
So you can kind of jump around.
That's bad.
That's getting awesome.

1468
01:18:27.510 --> 01:18:31.340
Yeah.
Oh my fucking cool dude.
That's a mind fuck and a half isn't it?

1469
01:18:31.370 --> 01:18:34.460
But you won't be using it and streaming it live thanks to Verizon's data caps.

1470
01:18:35.270 --> 01:18:39.320
What is browse data caps now company that's selling any company that's selling

1471
01:18:39.321 --> 01:18:43.940
limited data plans right now is stifling innovation and fucking consumers over

1472
01:18:43.941 --> 01:18:46.040
and fucking over entire does travel limited,

1473
01:18:46.220 --> 01:18:49.790
rented the only one but they barely have a network.
They have a decent network.

1474
01:18:49.791 --> 01:18:53.790
They have an own union with dude for Tang and good.
It's not,
it's,
it's uh,

1475
01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:58.290
it's a shadow of what a t and t and Verizon provides as far as four g may be.

1476
01:18:58.550 --> 01:19:02.210
Absolutely not as hierarchy,
date coverage.
No,
no,
no.
And it's fine for coverage.

1477
01:19:02.211 --> 01:19:05.460
But the,
the problem is that now we're training,
uh,

1478
01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:09.080
customers and consumers to second guess their decisions when it comes to data.

1479
01:19:09.260 --> 01:19:12.230
Like could you imagine on your home computer second guessing downloading world

1480
01:19:12.231 --> 01:19:15.050
of Warcraft where you might,
cause you don't play it,
but downloading a movie,

1481
01:19:15.051 --> 01:19:17.260
streaming Netflix because you're worried about the mudroom,

1482
01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:20.180
worried about the data caps.
Now we're going back,

1483
01:19:20.181 --> 01:19:22.220
we're regressing from unlimited back to the days of,

1484
01:19:22.221 --> 01:19:25.190
you got 93 hours or four free megs on prodigy.

1485
01:19:25.490 --> 01:19:28.700
So it used to be unlimited.
And then with the iPhone,

1486
01:19:28.730 --> 01:19:30.830
it really kind of clogged up the network.
Right.

1487
01:19:30.860 --> 01:19:34.430
That's the dose in general with smartphones in general,

1488
01:19:34.431 --> 01:19:38.780
that signal the shift from being a traditional voice device to now I rarely make

1489
01:19:38.781 --> 01:19:42.620
calls on my phone.
I'm sending texts,
I'm streaming videos,
I'm tweeting,

1490
01:19:42.770 --> 01:19:45.940
I'm on Reddit.
Like never talk on the phone.
Yeah,
yeah.

1491
01:19:45.950 --> 01:19:47.750
And we Skype because it's easier to see it.

1492
01:19:48.220 --> 01:19:50.120
I feel like you're so close to me and said,
telling me through the Internet.

1493
01:19:50.540 --> 01:19:51.291
But to that point,

1494
01:19:51.291 --> 01:19:55.010
I did like to Skype sessions on the road with a Verizon little four g hotspot,

1495
01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:59.840
little jetpack,
and I used up 3.9 gigs and just like an hour of video chat.

1496
01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:03.200
And so now it was bad.
I was afraid to check emails and do work and I'm like,

1497
01:20:03.201 --> 01:20:05.030
this is bad for an entire industry.

1498
01:20:05.031 --> 01:20:08.520
This will stifle innovation because the next day the Instagram of video might

1499
01:20:08.521 --> 01:20:10.920
not get created if it takes up too much band.
Well,

1500
01:20:10.921 --> 01:20:15.450
why is cellular so much more expensive than canned?
Is that all it is?

1501
01:20:15.510 --> 01:20:16.350
Because they can't.

1502
01:20:16.351 --> 01:20:19.170
They would say it's because it's more expensive to launch the satellites and
the,

1503
01:20:19.171 --> 01:20:21.600
the,
the bandwidth itself is crazy expensive.
It's really,

1504
01:20:21.601 --> 01:20:24.150
I mean you can throttle during peak usage,

1505
01:20:24.151 --> 01:20:27.090
but there's no reason to limit how much data I can suck down at 3:00 AM your

1506
01:20:27.091 --> 01:20:29.760
network is not that congested,
you know the air.

1507
01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:34.590
Is there more expensive for them if people use more or is it there it's not

1508
01:20:34.591 --> 01:20:36.210
taxing on their system and their infrastructure?

1509
01:20:36.211 --> 01:20:39.270
That's what to ask you or is it that their system can't handle it?
Sure.

1510
01:20:39.271 --> 01:20:41.640
I mean that at some point,
yes it gets to that.
But it's,

1511
01:20:41.641 --> 01:20:44.970
so that's a way of limiting yet by getting people to pay more.
Right.

1512
01:20:44.971 --> 01:20:45.850
But the price of bay,

1513
01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:48.780
I mean there's been studies that show that what you pay now for bandwidth,

1514
01:20:48.810 --> 01:20:50.850
even though it is more expensive and it's faster,

1515
01:20:50.851 --> 01:20:54.240
what you pay now for bandwidth is exponentially higher than what you used to
pay.

1516
01:20:54.780 --> 01:20:57.510
Bandwidth should be getting cheaper.
And the,
the problem that I had,

1517
01:20:57.511 --> 01:20:59.400
like I went in to get a jet pack from Verizon and a,

1518
01:20:59.401 --> 01:21:02.790
you have to pay to be a new customer,
right?
That's just to put you in a system.

1519
01:21:03.060 --> 01:21:06.450
You have to pay for the SIM card essentially that they're gonna pop into your,

1520
01:21:06.590 --> 01:21:08.490
they're gonna device.
You're going to tether it to the account.

1521
01:21:08.820 --> 01:21:12.090
You have to pay for the device itself,
sign up for a contract.

1522
01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:14.400
Then with their data plans,
you have to pay for the data.

1523
01:21:14.401 --> 01:21:16.350
You have to buy the bandwidth,
the four gigs a month,

1524
01:21:16.590 --> 01:21:21.030
and you have to pay extra to tethered to the device that you just bought that

1525
01:21:21.031 --> 01:21:23.880
you're under contract for.
So you have to pay to tether that to the data.

1526
01:21:24.710 --> 01:21:27.360
Like I don't mean to get on the nerdiest soapbox in the fucking world,

1527
01:21:27.361 --> 01:21:29.670
but that is bullshit.
That's like going into a restaurant,

1528
01:21:29.910 --> 01:21:34.140
paying to go into the door,
paying to sit down for your table,
ordering water.

1529
01:21:34.380 --> 01:21:37.110
You have to pay for the water,
pay for the cup that it's going to go into.

1530
01:21:37.111 --> 01:21:38.820
And then when you go to drink the water,
they're like,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

1531
01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:40.830
You have to tether a straw to that water.

1532
01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:42.630
I know you just bought that one and you're paying monthly.

1533
01:21:42.631 --> 01:21:45.750
You're paying out the ass for it even though it's just coming from a garden
hose,

1534
01:21:45.900 --> 01:21:48.810
but you've got to pay to tether a straw to sit that water.

1535
01:21:48.930 --> 01:21:53.760
It's fucking highway robbery.
Is that going to get better?
Maybe.
How,
how can you,

1536
01:21:53.790 --> 01:21:56.310
how can you fix that?
You'd have to have more companies getting,

1537
01:21:56.311 --> 01:21:58.770
there's gotta be collusion going on because once,
once,

1538
01:21:58.771 --> 01:22:02.490
once Verizon announces we're going to do this type of a data plan at t and t

1539
01:22:02.491 --> 01:22:04.740
follow suit,
sooner or later,
Sprint will,

1540
01:22:04.741 --> 01:22:08.190
once the network gets more popular and the advices gets sold there rising can't,

1541
01:22:08.191 --> 01:22:11.070
you can't use data and calls at the same time.

1542
01:22:11.071 --> 01:22:15.360
Even under four g under the new phone and a new on the new iPhone.
You can,

1543
01:22:15.390 --> 01:22:16.440
I think you can on Lte,

1544
01:22:16.441 --> 01:22:19.460
can you not can or is it refers to the three g network when you're talking again

1545
01:22:19.510 --> 01:22:24.460
on every single phone except the iPhone on Verizon's network.
You can or can't.

1546
01:22:24.980 --> 01:22:29.460
You cans can.
Fantastic.
You can't do,
you can't.
You can't do it on the iPhone,

1547
01:22:29.461 --> 01:22:32.220
but you can do that on every single,
on every other phone.

1548
01:22:32.490 --> 01:22:36.960
So if you buy like the galaxy s three you can do it.
I fucking,
I love the galaxy.

1549
01:22:36.961 --> 01:22:38.250
I hate those commercials.

1550
01:22:38.790 --> 01:22:41.280
No better way to make me not give a shit about your product.

1551
01:22:41.281 --> 01:22:44.490
Then by spending three minutes of airtime telling me that I'm a Douche by you

1552
01:22:44.491 --> 01:22:46.490
watching commercials.
I don't watch commercial.

1553
01:22:46.550 --> 01:22:48.930
They happen before web videos now and sometimes they're hard to skip.

1554
01:22:49.250 --> 01:22:51.420
I just fucking what if it was my eyes and hit mute.

1555
01:22:51.710 --> 01:22:54.770
What do you think about the Samsung Note?
Me Bitch.
Have you played with that?

1556
01:22:54.990 --> 01:22:58.800
I haven't really thought about the no much.
No kind of guy.
The galaxy note phone,

1557
01:22:58.801 --> 01:23:03.120
that's sort of a half time.
We reviewed it on attack when I was still there.
Yes,

1558
01:23:03.780 --> 01:23:06.060
it's delicious.
Holding a giant tablet to

1559
01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:10.150
<v 3>take hands doesn't bother me.
I like it.
It looks like a Bluetooth headset on you.</v>

1560
01:23:10.190 --> 01:23:13.800
It does not on me.
Not on me.
I need it in my life.

1561
01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:15.940
You haven't seen those commercials where they show that people waiting in line

1562
01:23:15.941 --> 01:23:18.100
for the iPhone.
It makes them look like assholes.

1563
01:23:18.101 --> 01:23:20.140
Talking about the incremental features.
I'm like,
listen,

1564
01:23:20.380 --> 01:23:23.200
spend your 30 seconds telling me why your phone is better,

1565
01:23:23.201 --> 01:23:25.090
which they barely do in the commercial.

1566
01:23:25.180 --> 01:23:27.670
They did spend time trying to make me feel like an asshole because they use an

1567
01:23:27.671 --> 01:23:31.150
iPhone.
I'm not opposed to a device.
It's no,
it's a nickel tactic at all.

1568
01:23:31.180 --> 01:23:34.160
It's a terrible tactic.
It's like because it may want to talk to a guy like me,

1569
01:23:34.161 --> 01:23:36.580
one of Obama,
so sell his product.

1570
01:23:36.581 --> 01:23:39.580
He's selling Mitt Romney by making fun of Obama.
I mean that's what he's doing.

1571
01:23:39.581 --> 01:23:41.060
He's doing a great job of selling it to.

1572
01:23:42.130 --> 01:23:45.770
He knows he has to get just the 53% of the country that pays taxes.

1573
01:23:46.860 --> 01:23:50.710
Those freeloaders don't care about them.
It's everybody.

1574
01:23:50.711 --> 01:23:53.170
Anybody who doesn't pay income tax,
he didn't give a fuck about.

1575
01:23:53.380 --> 01:23:57.530
That was one of the biggest gaps in political history.
Daf though.
No,
it's not.

1576
01:23:57.610 --> 01:24:00.670
Well,
it is a gap because you don't think George Bush,
senior,

1577
01:24:00.850 --> 01:24:05.040
George Bush w you don't think those guys think the exact same.

1578
01:24:05.350 --> 01:24:05.891
That's what I mean.
Yeah.

1579
01:24:05.891 --> 01:24:07.930
It was a gap in the sense that it got out and he said it,

1580
01:24:07.931 --> 01:24:10.870
but that's what they really think.
Course he's a business to what they think.

1581
01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:15.110
<v 0>There's never been a businessman that looked out for people and you think about</v>

1582
01:24:15.111 --> 01:24:17.600
a guy like,
and he's a ruthless businessman.

1583
01:24:17.601 --> 01:24:19.730
When you get to be the Bain capital of the world,

1584
01:24:19.731 --> 01:24:22.910
you get hundreds of millions of dollars of profit,
ladies and gentlemen.

1585
01:24:22.911 --> 01:24:26.030
You don't do it by doing what's best for people you're doing by.

1586
01:24:26.060 --> 01:24:27.860
You do it by doing what's best for your company.

1587
01:24:27.861 --> 01:24:32.050
You do it by maximizing one's and zero's.
That's it,
and you do.

1588
01:24:32.051 --> 01:24:35.150
You do it at the expense of humanity.
It's a creepy I.

1589
01:24:35.190 --> 01:24:38.750
There is no whole on the spreadsheet.
You're a one or a zero.

1590
01:24:38.751 --> 01:24:42.560
You're a bottom line to a business is this smacks of racist.
I'm like,

1591
01:24:42.561 --> 01:24:43.910
I am not an Obama Fan.

1592
01:24:43.940 --> 01:24:46.910
I do not like what he's done as far as civil liberties coat.

1593
01:24:46.930 --> 01:24:49.790
I think as a human being,
he seems like a great guy.

1594
01:24:49.820 --> 01:24:54.300
I don't understand why such a shit president because as a human being,
I see he,

1595
01:24:54.301 --> 01:24:58.490
he,
the way he interacts with people,
he seems like a genuine fund guy.

1596
01:24:58.490 --> 01:25:03.200
Like the way you hear stories of him in college,
a lot of weed,
but it's,
it's,

1597
01:25:03.230 --> 01:25:07.040
it's super,
super disappointing to me.
And then I,

1598
01:25:07.250 --> 01:25:11.660
but there's a big difference between him and Mitt Romney.

1599
01:25:11.780 --> 01:25:16.780
Mitt Romney is a creepy ass businessman and the idea that this guy being a

1600
01:25:17.271 --> 01:25:20.000
businessman would somehow another be better for this country.

1601
01:25:20.420 --> 01:25:24.230
I don't believe you think that.
I think you're racist.
I saw,
I think it is.

1602
01:25:24.231 --> 01:25:28.660
I think there's a lot of people that just want to believe that Mitt Romney would

1603
01:25:28.700 --> 01:25:32.540
do a better job because he's a businessman and he would get things done.

1604
01:25:32.541 --> 01:25:34.910
And you don't Mar Obama's for the distribution of wealth,

1605
01:25:35.090 --> 01:25:36.950
but then when you add your press them about it,

1606
01:25:36.951 --> 01:25:38.870
they really don't even know what the fuck that means.

1607
01:25:38.990 --> 01:25:42.290
90% of the people that talk about Obama being for the risk of redistribution of

1608
01:25:42.291 --> 01:25:42.680
wealth,

1609
01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:46.130
they don't even understand what the real concern amongst these socialist ideas

1610
01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:47.840
or most of what he's saying.

1611
01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:50.990
It's really not a redistribution of wealth in the classical sense.
It's not,

1612
01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:54.470
it's not like trying to steal money from people and Robin Hood the Motherfucker,

1613
01:25:54.710 --> 01:25:58.520
but you talked to a guy like Mitt Romney and he will put ones and Zeros ahead of

1614
01:25:58.521 --> 01:26:02.870
people for fucking sure.
And he will think that if rich people get richer,

1615
01:26:03.020 --> 01:26:06.170
they will make more jobs for the poor people and the poor people will be okay

1616
01:26:06.470 --> 01:26:08.390
and he will cut away funding and he will.

1617
01:26:08.420 --> 01:26:12.980
He will ultimately do things that are not good for people that are struggling.
I,

1618
01:26:12.981 --> 01:26:14.330
that's what I believe.
When when you,

1619
01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:17.220
when you talk about his tax policies and you find out that middleclass people

1620
01:26:17.221 --> 01:26:21.860
will actually have to pay more money,
2000 and average $2,000 more per year.

1621
01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:25.120
Fuck you man.
Fuck you.

1622
01:26:25.130 --> 01:26:27.200
For a guy who paid 14% yeah.

1623
01:26:27.370 --> 01:26:31.730
It's incredible that people would say that this guy seems like he'd be a good

1624
01:26:31.731 --> 01:26:34.790
choice.
I say even for what he's saying he would do.

1625
01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:37.520
I don't believe that he's going to do anything he says he'll do because Obama

1626
01:26:37.521 --> 01:26:40.550
didn't do anything.
He said he would do.
It didn't close down Guantanamo Bay.

1627
01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:42.920
He didn't stop fucking with the medical pot shops.

1628
01:26:42.921 --> 01:26:44.480
He didn't do anything he said he was going to do.

1629
01:26:45.050 --> 01:26:47.800
He didn't pull out of Iraq until years after he did.
He's says,

1630
01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:50.320
we're still there by the way.
We never really pull out.

1631
01:26:50.321 --> 01:26:53.180
You have a fucking enormous base.
They're filled with soldiers.

1632
01:26:53.181 --> 01:26:55.520
There's no pulling out.
There's no pulling out anywhere.

1633
01:26:55.540 --> 01:26:59.270
We have bases in a hundred countries plus so,

1634
01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:03.950
but just once he met Jerome 2016 just with Mitt Romney says he would do,

1635
01:27:03.951 --> 01:27:08.600
I'm like,
you really want that?
Fuck you man.
Fuck you.
You don't want that.

1636
01:27:08.660 --> 01:27:11.650
You just want a white guy.
You want to,
I've talked to people,

1637
01:27:11.670 --> 01:27:14.840
I'm like listening to the things they're saying and they don't even really know

1638
01:27:14.841 --> 01:27:17.840
what the Fuck Mitt Romney stands for.
They don't know what he's done.

1639
01:27:17.900 --> 01:27:19.610
And I think that's,
I think that is true.

1640
01:27:19.611 --> 01:27:22.730
I don't necessarily know that their decision though is rooted in racism.

1641
01:27:22.731 --> 01:27:26.090
I think it's just kind of rooted in a general ignorance about what he's really

1642
01:27:26.091 --> 01:27:28.580
done.
There's that,
but there's also this wiring.

1643
01:27:28.610 --> 01:27:33.140
There's a swath of racist out there and see some more.
Man,

1644
01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:37.040
I can't say that enough.
That a silly thing to be.

1645
01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:40.880
I have friends who are movements that hasn't really needs in a way that I

1646
01:27:40.881 --> 01:27:42.170
thought it would.
Well,
you can't,

1647
01:27:42.350 --> 01:27:44.930
you can't really bring it out because there's a lot of people in this country

1648
01:27:44.931 --> 01:27:47.060
that are religious and if you start making fun of religion,

1649
01:27:47.180 --> 01:27:50.090
you're going to lose a big giant chunk of them.
No one is saying,

1650
01:27:50.091 --> 01:27:53.510
ladies and gentlemen,
there is no god.
I am the last person to say there's no god.

1651
01:27:53.510 --> 01:27:54.170
You know why?

1652
01:27:54.170 --> 01:27:58.280
Because I haven't died and because I've experienced so I've experienced some

1653
01:27:58.281 --> 01:28:00.860
things in this life that are completely unexplainable.
I,

1654
01:28:00.861 --> 01:28:04.780
I'm not sure that reality makes any sense.
I'm not sure that it is a,

1655
01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:08.060
it's just reality is just like something you can touch and feel.

1656
01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:11.930
I have a feeling there's many more layers to this that we're not perceiving.

1657
01:28:12.140 --> 01:28:14.450
There could easily be something like a God.

1658
01:28:14.690 --> 01:28:16.850
But I'll tell you what's not real Mormonism.

1659
01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:21.050
There's not real that a fucking kid in 1820 who was 14 years old kid named

1660
01:28:21.051 --> 01:28:26.051
Joseph Smith found golden tablets that contained the loss work of Jesus and that

1661
01:28:26.361 --> 01:28:30.730
only he could read them because he had a magic rock and ex con by the way,

1662
01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:35.120
that yeah,
but both down at 14 he wasn't at 14 was just,
he was just a con man.

1663
01:28:35.150 --> 01:28:37.370
He became an ex con and a polygamous by the way.

1664
01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:40.280
They fucking took over Europe cause he wanted to bang multiple bitches.

1665
01:28:40.281 --> 01:28:41.570
He didn't want to be married to one broad.

1666
01:28:42.020 --> 01:28:46.670
The idea that you think that that guy had it all wrapped up,

1667
01:28:46.671 --> 01:28:50.450
that he was the messiah,
that he was the prophet.
You're a fucking idiot.
Okay.

1668
01:28:50.451 --> 01:28:53.720
That's a Dr Seuss book.
It's not even a good doctor Seuss book.

1669
01:28:53.780 --> 01:28:58.580
He found a magic rocks so he could read the tablets.
That's nonsense.

1670
01:28:58.700 --> 01:29:03.150
So if you're saying that you are a nonsense person,
no,

1671
01:29:03.210 --> 01:29:04.800
you can't be the president.

1672
01:29:05.140 --> 01:29:10.110
It least like Christianity and least Islam.

1673
01:29:10.111 --> 01:29:14.850
And it's,
we don't know the people who wrote them.
This is old,
old,
old,
old,

1674
01:29:14.851 --> 01:29:17.490
old shit.
When things get over a thousand years old,

1675
01:29:17.491 --> 01:29:20.310
it gets super blurry as to who really wrote it.

1676
01:29:20.460 --> 01:29:24.820
But we know the guy who wrote the book of Mormon,
we know the fucking guy.

1677
01:29:24.821 --> 01:29:28.830
You couldn't read the Wiki and see how it all got started because Jay balls 17

1678
01:29:29.100 --> 01:29:33.720
lays it out.
Did you know that it was,
they believe that there is another planet.

1679
01:29:33.780 --> 01:29:38.610
And then the Osmond brothers had an album based on this planet and was a call.

1680
01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:41.890
What was the,
what is the fucking planet?
The Mormon plan.
CLEP tar.
Oh,

1681
01:29:41.980 --> 01:29:43.140
something ridiculous.

1682
01:29:43.350 --> 01:29:48.350
Mormon Planet Osmund album.

1683
01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:50.940
And you know when I say this,
you know,
people say,

1684
01:29:50.941 --> 01:29:55.020
who the fuck you fucking eviews fucking this ain't I?
I am not an atheist.

1685
01:29:55.021 --> 01:29:58.020
I'm not an atheist,
but I am not a believer in bullshit.

1686
01:29:58.350 --> 01:30:01.350
And it's a weird thing to me that in this day and age,

1687
01:30:01.470 --> 01:30:06.470
you can look at something that obvious and people resist the idea that that's

1688
01:30:06.511 --> 01:30:10.650
bullshit.
You resist the idea that,
did Jesus really come back from the dead?

1689
01:30:10.651 --> 01:30:12.210
You really,
I'm not saying Jesus didn't exist.

1690
01:30:12.211 --> 01:30:13.860
I don't fucking know that Jesus existed,

1691
01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:18.450
but I guarantee you he didn't fucking just die and magically come back to life

1692
01:30:18.451 --> 01:30:22.650
and it's written down and because some crazy fucks that wrote a bunch of other

1693
01:30:22.651 --> 01:30:27.270
questionable shit down that clearly thought that slavery was okay.

1694
01:30:27.450 --> 01:30:30.960
Clearly treated women as second class citizens clearly said that you should

1695
01:30:30.961 --> 01:30:34.530
fucking be killed if you were at two different types of cloths at the same time.

1696
01:30:34.710 --> 01:30:38.130
I mean there's so much a looney tunes shit with that book,

1697
01:30:38.131 --> 01:30:42.390
but you can't live your life based on it at the Mormons figured out the loophole

1698
01:30:42.420 --> 01:30:45.300
for banging multiple wives at the same time.
You got to hand them that.

1699
01:30:45.301 --> 01:30:47.220
And I could see why someone would subscribe to that.

1700
01:30:47.310 --> 01:30:51.600
The planet is called call up k.
Yeah,

1701
01:30:51.780 --> 01:30:56.640
k.
O l.
O.
B.
And the Osmond's uh,
have uh,

1702
01:30:56.820 --> 01:31:01.140
in their,
their album.
Well they have one album called Kolbe and if you pull,

1703
01:31:01.141 --> 01:31:05.130
pull up the image of it,
Brian Osman Brothers,
k o l.
O.
B.

1704
01:31:05.400 --> 01:31:09.750
It's really weird cause they have like pictures drawn inside the planet of what

1705
01:31:09.751 --> 01:31:13.410
it would look like.
Artist renderings.
I met Donny Osmond and Donny Yasmine.

1706
01:31:13.440 --> 01:31:15.300
I did his show a couple times.

1707
01:31:15.300 --> 01:31:18.930
I did the Donny and Marie show with the news radio cast and I did it by myself

1708
01:31:18.931 --> 01:31:23.190
once.
And uh,
Donny Osmond is a very nice guy,

1709
01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:28.230
but uh,
I showed him some pictures of uh,
some,
some,

1710
01:31:28.740 --> 01:31:32.790
I think some girl pulled her tits out at the comedy store.
Oh no,

1711
01:31:32.791 --> 01:31:35.940
that's not what it was.
It was a black hooker when I was filming.

1712
01:31:36.620 --> 01:31:40.020
That's filming fear factor.
I took this picture of this,

1713
01:31:40.250 --> 01:31:43.920
this black hooker who was walking down the street and the sandwich is like the

1714
01:31:43.921 --> 01:31:46.950
great Sasquatch photo from,
you know,
like from the,

1715
01:31:46.951 --> 01:31:49.560
the Patterson Gimlin footage and get much footage.

1716
01:31:49.710 --> 01:31:53.260
It's literally injured by a telephone pole and she's eating the greatest,

1717
01:31:54.300 --> 01:31:56.880
it's the greatest photo.
I don't even know if it can be found online.

1718
01:31:56.881 --> 01:32:00.250
If you can be,
if you can find it online.
Google Hooker,
I cheeseburger.

1719
01:32:00.310 --> 01:32:02.140
<v 2>Is it online?
No,
she was eating,</v>

1720
01:32:02.141 --> 01:32:07.040
I'm a meatball sub and she pulled her tit out and she's got a meatball sub in

1721
01:32:07.041 --> 01:32:10.840
her hands.
She's got a blonde wig.
She,
and she pulled her tits out for me.
Well,

1722
01:32:10.841 --> 01:32:13.810
she was a hooker,
you know,
she was trying to draw with and viral for subway.

1723
01:32:13.811 --> 01:32:18.490
I think she just didn't,
she lost her status.
She was just there.
It was real.

1724
01:32:18.491 --> 01:32:20.230
It was the universe smiled upon.

1725
01:32:20.460 --> 01:32:23.740
So you show it to show this to Donny and I go check this shit out.

1726
01:32:23.741 --> 01:32:26.530
I got this fucking picture today on the set.

1727
01:32:26.680 --> 01:32:30.550
And Donny Osmond looked at me like I just ate his cat in front of them.

1728
01:32:31.620 --> 01:32:35.490
He looked at me like I just gave him poison,
shattered his world.

1729
01:32:35.520 --> 01:32:40.030
We ruined his chances at heaven.
I wish we were recording.
Guy was shocked.
I mean,

1730
01:32:40.031 --> 01:32:42.430
he was legitimately shocked and I thought about,
I was like,

1731
01:32:42.580 --> 01:32:47.050
how was this guy gotten through show business and I've met like Bret Michaels.

1732
01:32:47.050 --> 01:32:51.070
He was a very nice guy.
I met Tom Sides,
but I've met some real freaks,
you know,

1733
01:32:51.071 --> 01:32:53.050
and they were very nice guys that,
you know,

1734
01:32:53.051 --> 01:32:56.410
I've gotten to this high level of show business.
I'm like,
how is this guy like?

1735
01:32:56.411 --> 01:33:00.060
So weird.
How was he so weird like he does?

1736
01:33:00.140 --> 01:33:03.790
Has He taught by policy?
Has He seen cake farts are two girls.
One Cup?

1737
01:33:03.820 --> 01:33:06.580
I don't because that seems to be a mission.
He's a super,

1738
01:33:06.581 --> 01:33:08.530
we need to get to front Norman.
Great.

1739
01:33:08.531 --> 01:33:10.600
We need to get it in front of them and record that reaction.

1740
01:33:10.601 --> 01:33:13.850
Listened to him a Marie like order him around.
What's just magical?

1741
01:33:13.900 --> 01:33:17.920
It's your photo.
That's it.
That's a real photo.
You can't,
yes you can.
Oh,

1742
01:33:17.921 --> 01:33:21.130
because it Ustream really elicits a woman's breasts.
Let's take a chance.

1743
01:33:21.220 --> 01:33:24.220
Scroll it up real quick.
It's a real woman look at that.

1744
01:33:25.950 --> 01:33:30.760
Got flashed by the flower.
A woman.
The breasts was,
it'd be,
it was perfect.

1745
01:33:30.850 --> 01:33:33.280
It was this thick.
It's like draped over the hand.

1746
01:33:33.310 --> 01:33:36.640
It's literally like those photos on the moon where they're standing in a

1747
01:33:36.641 --> 01:33:38.680
spotlight where they're like this.
No Way.

1748
01:33:38.681 --> 01:33:42.700
This could have actually been like set up that he that perfectly and it was a

1749
01:33:42.701 --> 01:33:44.210
stupid ass camera too.

1750
01:33:44.211 --> 01:33:49.211
It was a shitty like Motorola flip phone because it's not even like a one

1751
01:33:49.421 --> 01:33:50.890
megawatt hours,
I don't think.

1752
01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:55.510
I mean I think it was maybe one meg might have been a megapixel but it just was

1753
01:33:55.511 --> 01:33:59.200
the perfect photo.
That lighting was perfect.
I love that picture.

1754
01:33:59.201 --> 01:34:03.700
I love that truth that there is a god smiled favorably upon you and gave you

1755
01:34:03.701 --> 01:34:04.534
that moment.
Yes.

1756
01:34:04.540 --> 01:34:08.620
Beautiful feel like I feel like there's something to that and perfectly lit and

1757
01:34:08.621 --> 01:34:10.420
it was my background image on my computer,

1758
01:34:10.421 --> 01:34:13.060
but every time I would open it up on a plane and get fucking shitty looks

1759
01:34:13.350 --> 01:34:14.011
beautiful.
I had,

1760
01:34:14.011 --> 01:34:18.760
I had tried to like put folders in front of her tit but to come up people would

1761
01:34:18.761 --> 01:34:20.690
still get mad at me.
Icons on the private.
Yeah.

1762
01:34:20.740 --> 01:34:23.770
I tried to put them in there that people would still like,
Whoa,
really?

1763
01:34:24.130 --> 01:34:25.630
I still leave landmines in my phone,

1764
01:34:25.631 --> 01:34:28.870
like in my photo and my it just in the photo roll because every now and then

1765
01:34:28.871 --> 01:34:30.670
someone might pick up a phone or if I'm on a set,

1766
01:34:30.910 --> 01:34:33.220
I want to make sure the wallpaper is interesting in case the phone goes off,

1767
01:34:33.221 --> 01:34:35.350
so someone seeds,
he's like just dudes fisting each other,

1768
01:34:35.950 --> 01:34:38.230
something brilliant and they always kind of look at,
oh,
your phone,

1769
01:34:38.231 --> 01:34:42.010
you've got to tea.
And he never finished when I got you got to,
Oh,
oh yeah.

1770
01:34:42.011 --> 01:34:42.970
My favorite thing in the world.

1771
01:34:43.270 --> 01:34:46.780
He's just thinking like this is the guy who calls him and then he sees the

1772
01:34:46.781 --> 01:34:50.350
picture of guys fisting when this guy calls.
But no,
it's every call.
It's a,
yeah,

1773
01:34:50.351 --> 01:34:51.400
it's the default wallpaper.

1774
01:34:51.580 --> 01:34:54.730
I want them and there was a while where where it was a Photoshop of me getting

1775
01:34:54.731 --> 01:34:58.310
fucked by Ryan Seacrest's,
which someone had made for me and put it on a cake

1776
01:34:58.700 --> 01:35:01.310
<v 3>to celebrate me going on the news.
That's a brilliant photos.</v>

1777
01:35:01.340 --> 01:35:04.610
That is one of my favorite things though about the iPhone is that big ass

1778
01:35:04.611 --> 01:35:06.410
picture that comes up when someone calls.

1779
01:35:06.411 --> 01:35:10.190
I think that is amazing that that to me is like very futuristic.

1780
01:35:10.191 --> 01:35:13.940
Like a few call me and I looked at my phone,
I see your face.
I'm like,
wow,

1781
01:35:13.970 --> 01:35:17.990
that's kinda crazy.
Better than fucking trips.
Like facetime is getting there,

1782
01:35:17.991 --> 01:35:21.280
but the ability to click and it's them video calling you.
That's,

1783
01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:23.150
that's where it's at.
That's fine.
Call up yet.

1784
01:35:24.370 --> 01:35:28.360
<v 0>K.
O.
L.
O.
V.
A.
K.
O.
L.
O.
B.
Yeah.</v>

1785
01:35:28.361 --> 01:35:32.050
You got to see it's fucking nonsense.
I think that the,

1786
01:35:32.350 --> 01:35:36.670
it might be called the plan.
Yeah.

1787
01:35:36.860 --> 01:35:39.290
<v 3>Their album is called the plan.
I might not be call up.</v>

1788
01:35:39.291 --> 01:35:43.160
It might be causing an album songs about Mormonism to,
is it like it's all,

1789
01:35:43.161 --> 01:35:43.994
it's all in there.

1790
01:35:44.420 --> 01:35:47.300
<v 0>They talk about the crazy,
you know shit that they believe it.</v>

1791
01:35:47.301 --> 01:35:48.260
I mean it's like it's a,

1792
01:35:48.300 --> 01:35:51.570
it's one of the nuttiest energy to see book of Mormon and I should see it.

1793
01:35:52.030 --> 01:35:56.660
It's also one of those religions where they are involved in the most arrests for

1794
01:35:56.720 --> 01:36:00.020
like having cults and fucking kids.
Like whenever,

1795
01:36:00.021 --> 01:36:02.270
like some polygamy guy gets busted it.
First of all,

1796
01:36:02.570 --> 01:36:05.630
it could just be that they're setting him up with the kid fucking thing,

1797
01:36:05.631 --> 01:36:07.700
but that's how they get them.
You know,
that they can't,
you know,

1798
01:36:07.701 --> 01:36:11.060
like the polygamy thing.
Well,
who can resist?
Well now they're also,
you know,

1799
01:36:11.090 --> 01:36:16.090
vice.com has been doing a whole series on where Mitt Romney came from that Mitt

1800
01:36:16.790 --> 01:36:20.180
Romney came from,
um,
religious sect of America,
uh,

1801
01:36:20.181 --> 01:36:23.720
American Mormons that move to Mexico so they could still bang multiple wives

1802
01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:26.360
because polygamy became outlawed.
They were like,
well fuck you.

1803
01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:27.320
We'll just move over here.

1804
01:36:27.500 --> 01:36:30.920
So now they're involved in like armed war with the cartels.

1805
01:36:31.010 --> 01:36:34.370
So it's the cartels versus the Romney's in Mexico.

1806
01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:38.720
Like there's drug wars going on,
the kidnapping,
them Romney's had been kidnapped,

1807
01:36:38.721 --> 01:36:42.590
other people had been kidnapped.
It's fucking carets has more money.

1808
01:36:42.591 --> 01:36:43.760
The cartels are the Romney's.

1809
01:36:43.790 --> 01:36:47.390
That's the quick cartels and the cartels by a long shot.
They have gold.

1810
01:36:47.391 --> 01:36:50.260
Everything.
Those guys make gold toothbrushes,
gold guns.

1811
01:36:50.261 --> 01:36:52.580
If you're seeing like how these guys go.
Jet Skis.
Yeah.

1812
01:36:52.581 --> 01:36:55.610
When they killed them and they find all the shit gold pistols.

1813
01:36:55.611 --> 01:37:00.020
And you got any photos?
I just pulled it up in three seconds.

1814
01:37:00.021 --> 01:37:04.340
You fuck mom,
are you using bang,
Bang it just more mass planet Osman album.

1815
01:37:04.370 --> 01:37:08.610
Dogpile the Cup Mormon Planet Osman Album Load Alta.

1816
01:37:08.750 --> 01:37:12.650
And it's the first Google image.
It's this is,
it's called the plan.

1817
01:37:13.220 --> 01:37:15.650
And if you,
uh,
look in it,
the other Google images,

1818
01:37:15.651 --> 01:37:19.990
there's one where it's got God's hand that's holding the planet.
It's,

1819
01:37:20.150 --> 01:37:21.020
it's so busy.

1820
01:37:21.060 --> 01:37:25.290
<v 3>He has the whole world in his hands.
Yes.
It's so,
yeah,
look at that.
No,</v>

1821
01:37:25.291 --> 01:37:28.080
that's not it.
That's not what I want to know who that guy is.

1822
01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:31.050
I liked that he bore his,
the Holbrook.

1823
01:37:32.280 --> 01:37:35.460
Mormon Planet Osmo.
Yes.
That's the,
that's the album.
If I'm the

1824
01:37:35.460 --> 01:37:40.020
<v 0>plan and if you look deep inside the album,
it's you,
uh,
try album art.</v>

1825
01:37:40.590 --> 01:37:43.460
You ever go?
Is there a Google image search?
Google it.

1826
01:37:43.470 --> 01:37:45.930
Just do a Google image search.
If you,
um,

1827
01:37:46.110 --> 01:37:49.350
I can ask Siri more.
What do you,

1828
01:37:49.351 --> 01:37:52.170
how many things you have grew up Mormon Planet Osmund album.

1829
01:37:52.171 --> 01:37:56.580
What do you have a warming planet odds.
My brother's playing the plan yet.

1830
01:37:57.060 --> 01:38:01.370
You can get all that other stuff out.
Come on now.
Yeah,
there it is.

1831
01:38:02.080 --> 01:38:06.360
See that is a,
that's the God holding the hand.

1832
01:38:06.361 --> 01:38:09.390
There he is holding the,
uh,
the planet that's call up.

1833
01:38:09.420 --> 01:38:11.640
He's just got a script that's the planet where like,

1834
01:38:11.700 --> 01:38:15.950
I guess God limbs or something like,
it's like such a shitty rhyme or,
uh,

1835
01:38:15.990 --> 01:38:19.140
such a shitty story.
It should be a rhyme.
Should be a doctor Seuss rhyme.

1836
01:38:19.380 --> 01:38:22.160
A kid who finds tablets,
you know,

1837
01:38:22.170 --> 01:38:24.300
they came looking for the tablets of where are these tablets?

1838
01:38:24.301 --> 01:38:27.570
He said angels came and took them away.
That was his answer.
I like that.

1839
01:38:27.690 --> 01:38:31.010
You shitbag fuck bad story.
Right?

1840
01:38:31.030 --> 01:38:35.470
And it's live journal quality writing,
but it's not even,

1841
01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:38.670
it's my journals.
Little better than that.
Back in 1820,
you couldn't,

1842
01:38:38.671 --> 01:38:42.300
you didn't have to show your sources,
know.
You'd have to cite anything in this,

1843
01:38:42.301 --> 01:38:45.760
uh,
this fucking guy who,
who wrote this stuff.
I mean,
does that,

1844
01:38:46.120 --> 01:38:49.650
this just Joseph Smith character that,
I mean,
it's,

1845
01:38:49.690 --> 01:38:51.360
it's a painfully bad story.

1846
01:38:52.280 --> 01:38:56.000
<v 1>I just,
it and none of it.
It's tough that it,
it plays a role,</v>

1847
01:38:56.020 --> 01:38:59.650
<v 0>a role at all in society and politics.
It's,
it's insane.
It's insane.</v>

1848
01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:04.000
The satisfied.
I'm not saying,
again,
I'm not saying I have any answers.

1849
01:39:04.001 --> 01:39:07.000
I certainly don't have any answers.
But I am saying that as human beings,

1850
01:39:07.300 --> 01:39:09.190
you know,
forget about religious freedom,
freedom.

1851
01:39:09.191 --> 01:39:13.720
At a certain point in time you have to have the ability to rationally express

1852
01:39:13.721 --> 01:39:14.770
what the fuck is going on.

1853
01:39:15.100 --> 01:39:19.810
And when you take into consideration a guys qualifications to be a leader,

1854
01:39:20.020 --> 01:39:22.960
one of them has to be,
whether he not,
he's up gullible.
Fuck.

1855
01:39:23.380 --> 01:39:24.400
<v 1>Well,
it's really that simple.</v>

1856
01:39:24.401 --> 01:39:27.370
You have freedom of expression when it comes to religion and that it's fine and

1857
01:39:27.371 --> 01:39:28.450
great believer that you want.

1858
01:39:28.451 --> 01:39:32.590
But when your religious beliefs influence policy,

1859
01:39:32.591 --> 01:39:34.060
which affects my freedom,

1860
01:39:34.150 --> 01:39:37.420
well suddenly I don't have religious freedom because I don't believe in the

1861
01:39:37.421 --> 01:39:40.360
crazy shit or what I deem to be,
you know,
not crazy.

1862
01:39:40.630 --> 01:39:42.850
And now your religion is informing my life.

1863
01:39:42.851 --> 01:39:44.150
It's determining what I can and can't.

1864
01:39:44.460 --> 01:39:48.460
<v 0>It's a very good point.
And it's also that religion like in,</v>

1865
01:39:48.470 --> 01:39:50.760
in choosing to believe something,

1866
01:39:50.761 --> 01:39:53.190
especially something as ridiculous as Mormonism,

1867
01:39:53.490 --> 01:39:56.880
that in choosing to believe in it,
it's sort of defines you as a person.

1868
01:39:56.881 --> 01:39:59.760
And I'm allowed to judge you in that sense.

1869
01:39:59.880 --> 01:40:03.150
If you're trying to run for a position of leadership,

1870
01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:05.460
I have to look at you as a potential leader.

1871
01:40:05.750 --> 01:40:09.390
There are a lot of people that I respect deeply in this world for their

1872
01:40:09.391 --> 01:40:11.120
intellect,
for their mind.
But I've,

1873
01:40:11.130 --> 01:40:15.240
I've had some people that I even really deeply respect and they have these

1874
01:40:15.241 --> 01:40:18.630
really big hiccups when it comes to religion and it comes to,

1875
01:40:18.930 --> 01:40:22.800
and when that happens,
that part of,
I know you,

1876
01:40:22.801 --> 01:40:26.160
I can't have that conversation with you anymore because you've got a wall up.

1877
01:40:26.161 --> 01:40:29.400
You've got this isn't,
you got an illogical spot.
You've got to like a little,

1878
01:40:29.580 --> 01:40:33.030
a little mine cancer in there.
Well,
you can't,
you can't,
just,

1879
01:40:33.031 --> 01:40:34.230
you can't rationalize.

1880
01:40:34.290 --> 01:40:38.670
I remember having a conversation with a school teacher and it was a really smart

1881
01:40:38.671 --> 01:40:43.650
guy.
He was an interesting guy and he said,
um,
there was,

1882
01:40:43.651 --> 01:40:43.950
uh,

1883
01:40:43.950 --> 01:40:48.950
someone said something about God and about how there is no other way.

1884
01:40:49.561 --> 01:40:54.220
I forget what it was.
And,
uh,
and uh,
I said,
so you seen evidence of,

1885
01:40:54.220 --> 01:40:57.880
<v 2>of stuff that that shows there's no other way that something could have existed</v>

1886
01:40:57.881 --> 01:41:00.550
except for a god.
And he goes,
yes,
as a matter of fact,

1887
01:41:00.551 --> 01:41:04.510
molecules have been shown to be so complex.

1888
01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:09.310
It would be impossible for us to even imagine that let alone create them.

1889
01:41:09.340 --> 01:41:13.750
That alone has to be proof of a god.
And the guy was like,
yes,
yes,

1890
01:41:13.751 --> 01:41:17.290
it must be in the other.
The woman was like,
it has to be proof of God.
I was like,

1891
01:41:17.291 --> 01:41:19.360
that is the craziest thing I've ever heard.

1892
01:41:19.390 --> 01:41:23.980
That means that a molecule to you is the proof of the God,

1893
01:41:24.130 --> 01:41:28.510
not the fucking universe.
The universe,

1894
01:41:28.511 --> 01:41:32.950
which is composed of molecules by the way,
that are all touching each other.

1895
01:41:32.951 --> 01:41:36.550
And by the way,
are all nothing filled with air.

1896
01:41:36.610 --> 01:41:39.190
A thousand years ago we didn't know there were molecules.

1897
01:41:39.370 --> 01:41:43.240
So it's preposterous to go,
you will,
this is too complex.
We'll never saw this.

1898
01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:47.230
We didn't even know you didn't have a usage for that word or knowledge of what

1899
01:41:47.231 --> 01:41:50.260
it was until science discovered,
oh,
there are these little things.

1900
01:41:50.410 --> 01:41:54.370
And clearly we have light years to go,
but,
but this guy,

1901
01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:57.160
this was what he was holding onto and I was like,
I was like,

1902
01:41:57.580 --> 01:41:58.840
you're a steer a tea.
I was like,

1903
01:41:58.841 --> 01:42:02.660
this guy's a teacher is a school teacher and he was a smart guy.
I was like,
I go,

1904
01:42:02.661 --> 01:42:05.320
Whoa,
come on man with,
there's no other way.
You know?

1905
01:42:05.321 --> 01:42:06.790
I'm not saying there's No God,
but your,

1906
01:42:06.791 --> 01:42:10.720
your argument is that something is super complex so only God could have created

1907
01:42:10.721 --> 01:42:14.410
it.
I was like,
you shut off.
You've a part of your head that doesn't work.

1908
01:42:14.530 --> 01:42:16.330
You don't use it.
My,
my mother,

1909
01:42:16.331 --> 01:42:20.830
despite being presented mountains of evidence that I was putting it in front of

1910
01:42:20.831 --> 01:42:24.400
her eyes,
really believe that John Edwards could talk to the dead,

1911
01:42:24.550 --> 01:42:27.190
like wanting to go on,
crossing over,
really wanted to meet him,

1912
01:42:27.191 --> 01:42:30.430
wanted to have him like believed in it,
not the presidential candidate,

1913
01:42:30.460 --> 01:42:31.600
not the presidential candidate,

1914
01:42:31.601 --> 01:42:34.810
the TV personality who claimed that he could speak to dead people and scammed

1915
01:42:35.190 --> 01:42:38.060
fat,
countless thousands of people out of their money by saying he,

1916
01:42:38.230 --> 01:42:40.810
he would do cold readings.
Basically.
I'm getting something with a j,

1917
01:42:41.500 --> 01:42:43.990
he would do that.
And I showed her the technique.
There were books on it.

1918
01:42:43.991 --> 01:42:47.560
I showed where he was trained at all that stuff.
Despite that she refused.

1919
01:42:47.561 --> 01:42:50.890
She had that wall she wanted to believe cause she needed to believe.

1920
01:42:51.040 --> 01:42:55.750
And at some point if she were president,
that may inform her decisions.

1921
01:42:55.751 --> 01:42:57.070
She might believe that those people exist.

1922
01:42:57.130 --> 01:42:59.620
She might go to them for foreign policy advice.

1923
01:42:59.621 --> 01:43:02.890
Like Lord knows how that would influence things.
Yes,
for sure.

1924
01:43:02.891 --> 01:43:05.920
If you're a gullible person should not want to keep talking and I flag on the

1925
01:43:05.921 --> 01:43:09.460
play and
see me.
Ladies and gentlemen,

1926
01:43:09.730 --> 01:43:13.270
I could drink coffee right down.
Open this door.
It's the last door on your left.

1927
01:43:13.450 --> 01:43:16.990
Me.
I drink coffee.
I can handle it.
I can keep it together.
You know my,

1928
01:43:17.020 --> 01:43:21.750
my broadcast partner in the UFC feeling sexy now.
Thank you the way better.

1929
01:43:22.210 --> 01:43:25.750
Um,
my broadcast partner in the UFC,
Mike Goldberg,
who I love to death,

1930
01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:28.120
has the smallest bladder of any human being on the planet.

1931
01:43:28.240 --> 01:43:32.050
It's so bad that we count me and the sound guys,

1932
01:43:32.170 --> 01:43:35.100
we have a running count and sometimes we'll have like a pool.
I,

1933
01:43:35.260 --> 01:43:37.570
I'll say like it will be over five or over six.

1934
01:43:37.750 --> 01:43:41.350
He will get up six times during the broadcast to pee.

1935
01:43:42.190 --> 01:43:45.220
I mean literally he'll get up,
he'll pee and then we'll run out in a p again.

1936
01:43:45.221 --> 01:43:49.240
It's crazy.
I have video of him in Vegas getting up and being,

1937
01:43:49.241 --> 01:43:52.490
getting no getting mad when I said,
why do you pee so much?

1938
01:43:52.491 --> 01:43:53.990
And then he like you tell Rogan

1939
01:43:56.210 --> 01:43:58.690
he gets mad because I bring it up because a,

1940
01:43:58.700 --> 01:44:01.070
I was playing a drinking game for a while.

1941
01:44:01.071 --> 01:44:03.290
I stopped playing the drinking games cause they didn't want people to torture

1942
01:44:03.291 --> 01:44:06.860
him with the drink game was every time he would go get up I would be the guy who

1943
01:44:06.861 --> 01:44:08.720
was introducing the fighters as they would walk through.

1944
01:44:08.870 --> 01:44:11.300
It's usually the way it sets up is Mike Goldberg.

1945
01:44:11.301 --> 01:44:15.590
We'll introduce a fighter and as the guys walking into the octagon,

1946
01:44:15.591 --> 01:44:18.500
it's a couple minutes.
So Mike will say the guy's name,

1947
01:44:18.620 --> 01:44:21.080
he'll maybe say some pertinent facts about the guy.

1948
01:44:21.290 --> 01:44:23.960
And I will address his strengths as an athlete.

1949
01:44:23.990 --> 01:44:27.770
I was addressed his style and what recently is coming off of and what I think he

1950
01:44:27.771 --> 01:44:29.300
needs to do here tonight.

1951
01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:31.700
And so that people have something to think about when the guy steps into the

1952
01:44:31.701 --> 01:44:33.470
octagon.
They don't just know the guy's name,

1953
01:44:33.650 --> 01:44:34.940
they also know a little bit about the guy.

1954
01:44:35.180 --> 01:44:39.980
But when you only hear me talking and I'm like,
you know,
uh,
Alan,

1955
01:44:39.981 --> 01:44:44.870
the talent Belcher ounce fight now to do groups as if it's just me talking.

1956
01:44:44.900 --> 01:44:48.770
That means Goldberg's Pison and I was saying,
are you throwing crickets in there?

1957
01:44:48.880 --> 01:44:49.790
And just saying this is boring.

1958
01:44:50.340 --> 01:44:53.930
That's like you only you are talking in Mike's gone worse.
That women,

1959
01:44:54.480 --> 01:44:58.070
that's not the use of crickets.
It's a roaring arena.
There's no crickets.

1960
01:44:58.550 --> 01:45:00.070
Why is he leaving?
He's leaving.

1961
01:45:00.090 --> 01:45:02.870
There's a cricket all of a sudden that this illogical son.

1962
01:45:07.190 --> 01:45:08.890
So he runs off and uh,

1963
01:45:08.930 --> 01:45:11.630
I say what she playing the UFC drinking game time to take a drink,

1964
01:45:11.631 --> 01:45:15.980
ladies and gentlemen.
And that just,
uh,
you know,
I think that tortured them.

1965
01:45:16.070 --> 01:45:19.880
I think too many people went after him.
By the way,
you're in North Carolina,

1966
01:45:22.190 --> 01:45:26.420
still available.
So go to where Joe Rogan.
Dot.
Yeah.

1967
01:45:26.421 --> 01:45:30.590
You can go to Joe rogan.net and all the information is also available on my

1968
01:45:30.591 --> 01:45:32.120
Twitter.
If you go to my Twitter page,

1969
01:45:32.460 --> 01:45:36.680
which is twitter.com forward slash Joe Rogan,
I'm in Raleigh,
uh,

1970
01:45:36.681 --> 01:45:41.030
on Friday night at the Memorial Hall and an I'm an Asheville on Saturday night

1971
01:45:41.031 --> 01:45:43.850
at Thomas Wolfe.
I've been a Raleigh.
I love Raleigh.

1972
01:45:43.880 --> 01:45:48.290
I gotta Holla at my boy cliffy be cliff it be from epic games.

1973
01:45:48.560 --> 01:45:51.800
Cliffy lives in Raleigh that fucking Saturday coming on the show.
Just how I got,

1974
01:45:51.801 --> 01:45:55.010
I got,
I got a contact email.
Contact John.
Is He guesting a show of yours?

1975
01:45:55.040 --> 01:45:58.250
That's awesome.
Um,
yeah,
like coming on,
like to do with a thing,

1976
01:45:58.251 --> 01:46:01.000
like a lot of podcasts.
No,
I don't do slide podcasts.

1977
01:46:01.030 --> 01:46:02.870
I think live podcasts are a rip off.

1978
01:46:02.871 --> 01:46:05.960
I'm sorry for all those people out there that are doing live podcasts that are

1979
01:46:05.961 --> 01:46:06.980
making money doing it.

1980
01:46:07.250 --> 01:46:11.450
But you're charging money to pay for people to sit down and watch something

1981
01:46:11.451 --> 01:46:15.020
that's not as entertaining as standup comedy in a comedy club.
That's how I feel.

1982
01:46:15.210 --> 01:46:18.690
I respect that.
I disagree with it.
What do you say it is?
I think that it's,

1983
01:46:18.691 --> 01:46:21.170
it's a live performance and like when I did lead up,

1984
01:46:21.200 --> 01:46:25.190
we made sure to make it interactive and to get people on stage and make them

1985
01:46:25.191 --> 01:46:28.430
part of it so it gives them an experience that they can't have the whole

1986
01:46:28.431 --> 01:46:29.330
festival about it.

1987
01:46:29.331 --> 01:46:32.090
Let me just explain something from a point of view of a standup comedian.

1988
01:46:32.091 --> 01:46:35.360
When I'm on stage and the crowd is,
it's a packed crowd.
There's 300 people.

1989
01:46:35.660 --> 01:46:37.640
I know.
What's the best thing I can do?

1990
01:46:37.900 --> 01:46:40.280
The best thing I can do is not sit down and have a conversation.

1991
01:46:40.281 --> 01:46:44.030
The best thing I can do is stand up and if there was a crowd here while we were

1992
01:46:44.031 --> 01:46:45.830
doing this,
if there was 300 people watching this,

1993
01:46:45.831 --> 01:46:48.590
I would not be able to have the same sort of conversational tone.

1994
01:46:48.800 --> 01:46:50.040
I would be hyper aware that

1995
01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:53.910
<v 3>all these people are watching and how fucking boring this is to show that.</v>

1996
01:46:54.070 --> 01:46:56.340
So you're paying 380 that on to me.
How dare you.

1997
01:46:57.780 --> 01:46:59.880
You just got fucking heavy.
We get an email.

1998
01:47:00.640 --> 01:47:04.050
<v 1>Say it's a whole new fucking world like there was,
I couldn't,</v>

1999
01:47:04.110 --> 01:47:07.520
I was trying to actively listen for like the last 20 minutes and I couldn't and

2000
01:47:07.530 --> 01:47:11.010
I couldn't figure out why and it's because I had to Piss so bad and it reminds

2001
01:47:11.011 --> 01:47:14.400
me,
there's a study that says that if you are driving with an intense need to

2002
01:47:14.401 --> 01:47:17.460
urinate,
it's about as bad as driving drunk.
Like your,

2003
01:47:17.461 --> 01:47:22.200
your ability to focus and your reaction times are so impaired because your body

2004
01:47:22.201 --> 01:47:24.960
is like empty your fucking bladder.
Oh I believe that.

2005
01:47:24.961 --> 01:47:27.210
I was going through that and I didn't realize it so I apologize.

2006
01:47:27.390 --> 01:47:29.940
But I'm here now.
It's a new day.
You handled it like a champ.

2007
01:47:30.510 --> 01:47:31.940
I was powering through man.
It was getting bad.

2008
01:47:31.950 --> 01:47:35.370
See I would definitely drop commercials cause old dudes want to piss a lot.

2009
01:47:35.371 --> 01:47:37.560
It's also why they invented adult diapers.
Yeah,

2010
01:47:39.420 --> 01:47:41.400
Brian use those once.
Well,

2011
01:47:41.401 --> 01:47:44.950
people in Times Square use them for New Year's eve and everybody knew.
Yeah,

2012
01:47:44.970 --> 01:47:48.210
I was there for new years and I was not interested in watching the ball drop,

2013
01:47:48.270 --> 01:47:49.250
but everybody was talking about,

2014
01:47:49.251 --> 01:47:52.590
it was like get there at six or 8:00 AM because you won't get near enough to see

2015
01:47:52.591 --> 01:47:54.540
anything or experience anything and you're going have to stand there all day.

2016
01:47:54.541 --> 01:47:56.610
And I'm like,
well what do you do if you got to go to the bathroom?
Like,
oh,

2017
01:47:56.611 --> 01:47:58.620
you have to wear diapers.
Everybody does.

2018
01:47:58.680 --> 01:48:02.040
Which has now changed my vision of any imagery in times square because the

2019
01:48:02.041 --> 01:48:03.840
people that are up front and you're the ball drop,

2020
01:48:03.960 --> 01:48:07.110
they'd been waiting since ADM and they have shit and piss in their drawer and it

2021
01:48:07.111 --> 01:48:10.170
doesn't help the smell.
My problem was that it smelled like shit everywhere.

2022
01:48:11.100 --> 01:48:14.590
<v 3>Yes sir.
It's not like the mountains and Werther's originals.
No,
no,
no,
no.</v>

2023
01:48:14.600 --> 01:48:18.740
Not Times Square.
He's shit.
No.
When he shit his pants,

2024
01:48:18.741 --> 01:48:22.940
it smelled like shit to a grocery store.
He shit his pants.

2025
01:48:23.820 --> 01:48:25.680
Oh,
there you go.
Yeah,
you can't hear you.

2026
01:48:25.860 --> 01:48:28.670
But isn't that weird like next time you see the people celebrating in the

2027
01:48:28.671 --> 01:48:30.020
streets at times square,

2028
01:48:30.110 --> 01:48:33.210
just know that a good percentage of them have a load in their drawers and they

2029
01:48:33.211 --> 01:48:36.200
are bringing in the new year.
Is that,
that is so ridiculous.

2030
01:48:36.201 --> 01:48:39.440
Is that same thing that is like commonly known,
like they know how to do hair.

2031
01:48:39.470 --> 01:48:43.330
Is there a forum where they meet and they say what kind of depends do you like?

2032
01:48:43.400 --> 01:48:45.950
Dusty landed in for smell protection.

2033
01:48:46.050 --> 01:48:49.130
They're like Disneyland Trin pin traders talking about strategies.

2034
01:48:49.190 --> 01:48:52.280
What do you do if you pick up a hot girl and you make out at midnight,

2035
01:48:52.281 --> 01:48:55.100
like you just meet and then at the stroke you just start making it and you're

2036
01:48:55.101 --> 01:48:56.480
both wearing diapers.
You got to do it.

2037
01:48:56.600 --> 01:49:00.700
You got to do a diaper swap because if they have to start 69 pull hers off yours

2038
01:49:01.190 --> 01:49:03.770
and then you bring it around and so that way you're bring her of them.

2039
01:49:03.940 --> 01:49:07.410
It's like back and forth forever,
man.
Get a hot doc.

2040
01:49:10.690 --> 01:49:12.770
Oh,
someone ate hot peanuts.
Meanwhile,

2041
01:49:12.771 --> 01:49:15.160
someone would be into that for someone that would be like,

2042
01:49:15.240 --> 01:49:17.510
there's definite community for that.
Fuck yeah.

2043
01:49:17.550 --> 01:49:19.340
There's a lot of people that want it.
Like Johnny balls.

2044
01:49:19.341 --> 01:49:22.910
17 is doing it right now on a free cam show.
[inaudible] seven.
Yeah.

2045
01:49:22.970 --> 01:49:25.520
It's if you could find people that want to get fucked by horses,

2046
01:49:25.521 --> 01:49:28.510
you can find people that want that video when you your shit,

2047
01:49:28.520 --> 01:49:32.400
when you hear the point where the horses,
yeah,
you hear that ground,

2048
01:49:32.401 --> 01:49:32.721
you know like,

2049
01:49:32.721 --> 01:49:36.020
oh that's the last sound you're going to be making for the rest of your life.

2050
01:49:36.050 --> 01:49:39.110
Like that is it.
Now I want that to be my new texts.
I want to hear that.

2051
01:49:39.111 --> 01:49:40.190
Whenever someone texted me,

2052
01:49:40.310 --> 01:49:43.760
I wonder what the numbers are of people that have been fucked to death by like

2053
01:49:43.790 --> 01:49:48.130
big animals like horses and shit.
Cause it's not just that one guy had enough.
Not

2054
01:49:48.130 --> 01:49:51.490
<v 2>Enough.
I was in traffic for an hour today.</v>

2055
01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:55.840
More people need to get fucked to death.
Yeah.
What are the numbers?

2056
01:49:55.900 --> 01:49:59.050
I wonder if so can we look at other than and Google that throughout history

2057
01:49:59.210 --> 01:50:01.540
would think more than a thousand.
How many people do you think

2058
01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:05.080
are the numbers decreasing or are they increasing?

2059
01:50:05.460 --> 01:50:08.050
Cause I feel like it's increasing because the population is increasing,

2060
01:50:08.370 --> 01:50:11.080
but also there wasn't Twitter back then.
So what else are we going to do?

2061
01:50:11.081 --> 01:50:13.220
You've got to get fucked by a horse.
How many people,
nothing else to do.

2062
01:50:13.270 --> 01:50:17.230
Influenced by the ability to put video of them getting fucked by an animal

2063
01:50:17.231 --> 01:50:18.450
online.
Why?
No,

2064
01:50:18.460 --> 01:50:22.630
that makes them pull the trigger facing camera on this thing has me doing more

2065
01:50:22.631 --> 01:50:24.080
than walking my neighbor's dog.
Absolutely.

2066
01:50:24.081 --> 01:50:28.060
It was a conversation that we had yesterday about convincing people to do things

2067
01:50:28.061 --> 01:50:29.670
that in the FBI,
in,

2068
01:50:29.671 --> 01:50:34.671
in trapping people is causing more chrome just in order to be able to solve it.

2069
01:50:35.170 --> 01:50:35.501
You know?

2070
01:50:35.501 --> 01:50:39.700
And that that's another sign of sickness in this crazy world that you can

2071
01:50:39.701 --> 01:50:44.520
actually talk somebody into doing something fucked up.
It's,
it's,
it's,

2072
01:50:44.540 --> 01:50:46.480
it's an endemic thing because of the bottom line.

2073
01:50:46.510 --> 01:50:49.720
They have to justify their jobs and show that they're preventing terrorism and

2074
01:50:49.721 --> 01:50:52.270
the only way to do that and a lot of these cases does it go out and attract

2075
01:50:52.390 --> 01:50:56.200
people and create scenarios that they can jump on board with and the people that

2076
01:50:56.201 --> 01:50:59.740
are doing it are people that are awesome at going undercover and pretending to

2077
01:50:59.741 --> 01:51:02.450
be someone else.
So they're getting a rush out of that too,
by the way.

2078
01:51:02.750 --> 01:51:03.800
A pulling it off.
Yeah.

2079
01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:06.910
Well sometimes those are the type of charismatic people that can talk you into

2080
01:51:06.911 --> 01:51:09.130
doing things.
You wouldn't have ordered it.
Right.
Done.
Right.

2081
01:51:09.160 --> 01:51:10.510
Well sometimes that's the case.

2082
01:51:10.570 --> 01:51:13.570
Sometimes they're taking ex cons and they're taking people that would normally

2083
01:51:13.571 --> 01:51:16.360
be stool lees and empowering them and saying,

2084
01:51:16.450 --> 01:51:20.080
you go do all the illegal shit you want to do and we'll back you with the badge.

2085
01:51:20.400 --> 01:51:21.970
We talked about all this yesterday,

2086
01:51:21.971 --> 01:51:23.790
unfortunately went over it with my friend tape.

2087
01:51:23.800 --> 01:51:26.230
We were talking about Whitey Bolger and all the different,

2088
01:51:26.231 --> 01:51:29.080
you know there's the guy who was working for the FBI was the head of the Boston

2089
01:51:29.081 --> 01:51:31.850
mob.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's a mess.
It's the system.

2090
01:51:31.851 --> 01:51:34.090
The system is fucking completely ridiculous when it comes.

2091
01:51:34.091 --> 01:51:36.550
So do you think they feds are running stings where they're encouraging people to

2092
01:51:36.551 --> 01:51:38.080
fuck horses or get fucked the courses?

2093
01:51:38.530 --> 01:51:42.380
It could be they that is possible.
I think someone could,

2094
01:51:42.760 --> 01:51:44.650
I have a joke where did the right kind of petting zoos.

2095
01:51:44.860 --> 01:51:48.250
I had a joke in my last special about Mormons that Mormons are afraid of gay

2096
01:51:48.251 --> 01:51:50.980
marriage and if anybody should be afraid of gay marriage that it's Mormons.

2097
01:51:51.220 --> 01:51:52.900
Cause if someone could talk you into being a Mormon,

2098
01:51:53.230 --> 01:51:56.140
they could probably talk in the suck and their deck and it really is true.

2099
01:51:56.140 --> 01:51:57.910
Like you should be scared.
You should be scared.

2100
01:51:57.911 --> 01:51:59.770
Someone talk you into something completely ridiculous.

2101
01:52:00.160 --> 01:52:02.140
Someone can talk people into,

2102
01:52:02.170 --> 01:52:05.170
there's a lot of people out there that are like super persuasive and they can

2103
01:52:05.171 --> 01:52:06.940
talk to people and doing a lot of things.

2104
01:52:07.230 --> 01:52:11.170
And so when someone does something and they do it with the aid of someone who

2105
01:52:11.171 --> 01:52:14.530
happens to be an agent,
I used to think that that was bullshit.

2106
01:52:14.620 --> 01:52:16.700
That person's a criminal.
Someone came on.

2107
01:52:16.810 --> 01:52:20.260
If someone came along to me and told me to blow up the capital building,

2108
01:52:20.770 --> 01:52:24.430
I'm going to do it,
but I'm not an idiot.
There's some people out there,

2109
01:52:24.431 --> 01:52:27.790
they're idiots and it's not fair that somebody can come along and convince this

2110
01:52:27.791 --> 01:52:31.720
idiot that you know he is going to defend Islam by giving him a Bot.

2111
01:52:31.721 --> 01:52:35.080
Like the guy in Dallas where their taps providing them with a fake bomb.

2112
01:52:35.200 --> 01:52:37.330
He pressed the button and then they moved in on him and arrested him.

2113
01:52:37.660 --> 01:52:39.550
They gave him a fake,
but I gave him the bomb.

2114
01:52:39.551 --> 01:52:42.040
They gave him cab fare and it gave him everything he needed to do it.

2115
01:52:42.100 --> 01:52:42.730
And by the way,

2116
01:52:42.730 --> 01:52:46.190
there are people listening to this right now that are wearing queue re

2117
01:52:46.190 --> 01:52:50.120
<v 3>balanced bracelets because they believe it gives them the power to lift cars and</v>

2118
01:52:50.121 --> 01:52:53.990
balanced better.
So if people can be convinced to spend,
I believe that.

2119
01:52:54.170 --> 01:52:56.690
Do they really believe it or do they know that they're showing that?
I had a guy,

2120
01:52:58.160 --> 01:53:01.670
it's just power placebo.
This guy tried to do that to me,

2121
01:53:01.700 --> 01:53:03.860
not to this guy who was a salesman.

2122
01:53:03.890 --> 01:53:06.350
Mike Goldberg was telling me how great they were.
He was wearing one.

2123
01:53:06.360 --> 01:53:08.930
This guy was going,
he got to wear this.
This guy just going to show you.

2124
01:53:09.170 --> 01:53:13.220
So he brings this guy over and this guy tries some fucking Carney tricks on me.

2125
01:53:13.250 --> 01:53:16.010
Right?
Like putting this down on your hands behind you,
clasp your hands.

2126
01:53:16.011 --> 01:53:18.590
I'm gonna push down on him.
Look,
you talked it over.
Those now put the,
I go,

2127
01:53:18.591 --> 01:53:20.500
what are you doing?
I go,
what are you doing?
I go,

2128
01:53:20.510 --> 01:53:23.540
you're not doing it the same way.
I go,
you're the,
your angle is different.
I go,

2129
01:53:23.541 --> 01:53:27.350
stand right here.
I go,
now do it.
I go,
yeah man,
what are you doing?
And I go,

2130
01:53:27.351 --> 01:53:29.320
and then I looked at the other guy.
Well,
what are you guys doing?
I,

2131
01:53:29.330 --> 01:53:32.300
you're playing little Carney tricks.
I go,
if you want to do something,
I go,

2132
01:53:32.301 --> 01:53:33.740
let's do it exactly the same way.
I go,

2133
01:53:33.741 --> 01:53:36.590
put my arm down now and he couldn't pull my arm down.
I go,
come on,

2134
01:53:36.591 --> 01:53:40.290
pull my arm down now.
Hold on,
hold on.
I got another bracelet.
Yeah,
I go,
I go,
no,

2135
01:53:40.291 --> 01:53:43.640
not try to do it.
I go,
you crazy who help bought this and Mike,

2136
01:53:43.641 --> 01:53:47.150
how is anybody buying that people but like you're moving around and showing me

2137
01:53:47.151 --> 01:53:51.770
different angles.
I I do Jujitsu.
I understand that there's leverage,

2138
01:53:51.800 --> 01:53:54.590
you're changing the leverage points and people didn't even get that though.

2139
01:53:54.590 --> 01:53:58.040
Some people got convinced by an infomercial in two ways.
Some people fuck that.

2140
01:53:58.041 --> 01:53:59.420
Some people got convinced by this guy.

2141
01:53:59.421 --> 01:54:02.840
I was watching people agree with him like yeah I do have more balance and I

2142
01:54:02.841 --> 01:54:05.990
threw a fucking wet diaper into the party.
I was like,

2143
01:54:05.991 --> 01:54:07.390
what the fuck are you talking to?

2144
01:54:07.400 --> 01:54:10.580
And he was going to get the company bonus trip to Cabo and you ruined his

2145
01:54:10.581 --> 01:54:11.001
numbers.

2146
01:54:11.001 --> 01:54:15.830
This guy grabbed my hand and like pinned it like to my body and like was like

2147
01:54:15.831 --> 01:54:19.100
playing mercy with me and like lifting my now try to resist.
I was like,

2148
01:54:19.101 --> 01:54:23.450
what the fuck are you talking about?
You really well this is some silly shit.

2149
01:54:23.600 --> 01:54:26.630
If you wanted to prove that it would give you better strength,

2150
01:54:26.810 --> 01:54:29.570
you would make me lift weights.
You would say lift weights.

2151
01:54:29.571 --> 01:54:32.870
Now that you have this Brent,
why don't you feel stronger?
You know,

2152
01:54:33.140 --> 01:54:36.830
come on silly bitch.
So if people can be talked into that shit,

2153
01:54:36.890 --> 01:54:39.770
that shit will can be talked into it as an excuse to wear jewelry.

2154
01:54:39.771 --> 01:54:40.604
I think there's no,

2155
01:54:40.800 --> 01:54:43.970
it's really not that fat that's fashionable as a Christ still sleep people.

2156
01:54:43.971 --> 01:54:48.170
It's all,
I see it all the time.
But what it is,
is,
is a psychological tool.

2157
01:54:48.230 --> 01:54:52.430
There's something that it's a placebo.
Yes.
But in that respect,

2158
01:54:52.431 --> 01:54:56.810
for some reason it seems to work,
you know,
with,
with athletes,

2159
01:54:56.811 --> 01:55:01.310
even there was a measurable difference even in people that thought that it was a

2160
01:55:01.311 --> 01:55:02.144
placebo.

2161
01:55:02.360 --> 01:55:05.570
Even in people that went in with a preconceived notion that it was a placebo,

2162
01:55:05.690 --> 01:55:07.250
knowing that they're probably right,

2163
01:55:07.280 --> 01:55:11.030
still had a benefit of it because they were trying to convince themselves that

2164
01:55:11.031 --> 01:55:12.420
it works.
The

2165
01:55:12.420 --> 01:55:16.090
<v 1>blood pressure placebo trial the last time I was here?
No,
it was uh,</v>

2166
01:55:16.410 --> 01:55:18.450
you might want to be,
it's worth,
it's worth googling the,

2167
01:55:18.460 --> 01:55:19.920
I'll give you the fuzzy cliffnotes of it,

2168
01:55:19.921 --> 01:55:23.010
but basically they did a study where they gave people a placebo and told them

2169
01:55:23.011 --> 01:55:25.260
that it was a re real peel that was a real pill.

2170
01:55:25.400 --> 01:55:27.960
You can lower their heart rate and their blood pressure and work miracles,

2171
01:55:27.990 --> 01:55:29.670
miracles for them.
Then they get another group,

2172
01:55:29.700 --> 01:55:33.090
the same pill if it's a sugar water pill and they said this is a placebo,

2173
01:55:33.240 --> 01:55:34.380
this pill does nothing,

2174
01:55:34.680 --> 01:55:38.010
but we're doing this study to see if it will lower your blood pressure.
It did.

2175
01:55:38.040 --> 01:55:41.370
It did lower it in the people that even were told it was a placebo and when the,

2176
01:55:41.580 --> 01:55:44.160
when the trial ended,
they,
okay,
that's it.
Thank you.

2177
01:55:44.280 --> 01:55:46.110
<v 2>The people revolted and they said,
what are you doing?
My,</v>

2178
01:55:46.140 --> 01:55:48.870
my blood pressure is going to go back up.
I need this pill.
And they're like,
no,

2179
01:55:48.871 --> 01:55:51.600
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
It's a placebo.
It does nothing.
The pill does nothing.

2180
01:55:51.780 --> 01:55:55.530
And they had to start manufacturing placebo pills.
This is the same.

2181
01:55:56.040 --> 01:55:59.790
You give me a detailed,
this is the exact same story.
I just simplified it.

2182
01:56:00.460 --> 01:56:04.200
You made it much more clear that that is,
there's some weird with our brains,

2183
01:56:04.290 --> 01:56:08.100
there's something weird with our brains when we believe things because I think

2184
01:56:08.101 --> 01:56:12.540
that reality is more malleable than we think it is.

2185
01:56:12.680 --> 01:56:16.800
You know that we've,
we've,
we've shown that there's certain,

2186
01:56:16.830 --> 01:56:19.890
there's a certain amount of effect,

2187
01:56:20.160 --> 01:56:24.540
positive energy and mood can have on people and there's a certain amount of

2188
01:56:24.541 --> 01:56:27.960
effect.
True belief in something can have on your environment.

2189
01:56:28.590 --> 01:56:33.590
There's something weird going on with the mind that it's not quite as simple as

2190
01:56:34.651 --> 01:56:37.140
we'd like to think it is.
It's not one plus one equals two.

2191
01:56:37.290 --> 01:56:41.460
It's one plus one equals two.
But if you believe in magic,
it might equal five,

2192
01:56:41.490 --> 01:56:42.450
right?
You can have,

2193
01:56:42.710 --> 01:56:47.390
you can have a magic variable in your equation that you change the outcome of

2194
01:56:47.510 --> 01:56:51.570
the algorithm.
There's,
there's belief in yourself as a strange thing.

2195
01:56:51.580 --> 01:56:54.900
Belief in things is,
that's why I tell people don't believe in yourself.
Well,

2196
01:56:54.901 --> 01:56:59.430
don't believe it.
Don't believe in anything or anyone and you know,
but no,

2197
01:56:59.431 --> 01:57:01.650
because if you believe in things,
it can empower you.

2198
01:57:01.651 --> 01:57:03.060
That's what's really fucked up.

2199
01:57:03.090 --> 01:57:07.020
Positive energy begets where does positive on a simple as positive energy
though.

2200
01:57:07.021 --> 01:57:10.540
It's not like that sort of some hippy idea,
isn't it?
What's the difference?

2201
01:57:10.550 --> 01:57:13.260
Just thinking positive.
It's not just thinking positive.

2202
01:57:13.261 --> 01:57:18.261
It's thinking specifically about certain results and thinking,

2203
01:57:18.391 --> 01:57:20.820
but it's thinking and be me in that direction.

2204
01:57:20.850 --> 01:57:22.820
Certainly you can just sit there and wish.
Yeah,

2205
01:57:22.830 --> 01:57:27.630
but I'm saying that there's some sort of a magical combination that when when

2206
01:57:27.631 --> 01:57:32.631
used is greater than the sum of its parts and that there's something to the

2207
01:57:32.761 --> 01:57:37.530
human mind that affects reality in a way that I don't think we've totally

2208
01:57:37.531 --> 01:57:42.230
measured yet.
I think that,
I think there's,
there's,
you know,

2209
01:57:43.140 --> 01:57:45.750
there've been studies that show that people that undergo surgery where there's a

2210
01:57:45.751 --> 01:57:48.450
certain rehab time,
if they believe in the power of prayer,

2211
01:57:48.451 --> 01:57:52.560
they tend to heal quicker and fuller faster.
And so there is clearly,

2212
01:57:52.561 --> 01:57:56.100
there's some quantifiable evidence,
so you should believe in something,
you know,

2213
01:57:56.101 --> 01:57:59.730
even believing in something that's bullshit.
Like if it empowers you,

2214
01:57:59.970 --> 01:58:02.550
there's something weird about that.
You should be wearing a queue right now.

2215
01:58:02.610 --> 01:58:07.140
Rubber bracelets for some weird people.
It's what they needed.

2216
01:58:07.150 --> 01:58:10.950
It's that that trigger that they needed to fire up that certain part of their

2217
01:58:10.951 --> 01:58:14.850
brain that gives you the green light to expect certain results.

2218
01:58:14.850 --> 01:58:16.140
They needed a tote.
Him like,

2219
01:58:16.141 --> 01:58:19.680
I can't believe that just the power of thought will be enough to compel me into

2220
01:58:19.681 --> 01:58:21.660
a positive or propelled me into a positive direction,

2221
01:58:21.661 --> 01:58:26.460
but you give me a rubber trinket that I can now attach that positivity to and I

2222
01:58:26.461 --> 01:58:28.800
go,
I believe that because that's a thing that has a,

2223
01:58:28.810 --> 01:58:31.580
an alloy is something with crystal.
It's some things.

2224
01:58:31.590 --> 01:58:34.370
It was a mine gets the green light.
Right.
You know what?

2225
01:58:35.130 --> 01:58:39.510
I realize that there's some,
when I was a kid,
when I was competing in taekwondo,

2226
01:58:39.540 --> 01:58:42.040
when I was 19 years old,
I went to watch

2227
01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:43.000
<v 0>the World Cup.</v>

2228
01:58:43.220 --> 01:58:48.220
Like I had a run from the time when I was 17 till I was 21 I won the

2229
01:58:49.901 --> 01:58:54.040
Massachusetts state championship every year and then one year I won the US Open.

2230
01:58:54.041 --> 01:58:58.150
I came in second in the U S Cup.
I was like a really highly ranked nationally.

2231
01:58:58.300 --> 01:59:02.080
And that year was the year that I went to watch the World Cup because I went to

2232
01:59:02.081 --> 01:59:04.750
Colorado Springs and I saw it,
the best fighters in the world.

2233
01:59:04.870 --> 01:59:09.580
And I came back from just watching it and all the sudden I was like a year

2234
01:59:09.581 --> 01:59:10.240
better.

2235
01:59:10.240 --> 01:59:15.010
It was like I had made this huge leap and I had a friend of mine who was a,

2236
01:59:15.070 --> 01:59:19.570
who is,
he's name is junk,
sick junk,
sick Chang was a kid,
was a fucking,

2237
01:59:19.660 --> 01:59:22.540
it was a maniac.
This guy was a,
uh,

2238
01:59:23.340 --> 01:59:25.480
a student who was a medical student.

2239
01:59:25.660 --> 01:59:29.320
He was going through his internship and training to be on the US Olympic

2240
01:59:29.321 --> 01:59:31.960
taekwondo team at the same time.
He was a fucking savage,

2241
01:59:32.110 --> 01:59:34.720
just the most hardest working kid I've ever met in my life.

2242
01:59:34.930 --> 01:59:39.130
I slept three hours every night,
which train like a fucking mad man.
Um,

2243
01:59:39.160 --> 01:59:41.960
but we were talking about it.
He goes,
what happened?
Goes,
what?

2244
01:59:42.280 --> 01:59:44.980
How'd you get so good?
What happened?
And I'm like,
I don't know.

2245
01:59:45.100 --> 01:59:48.430
I went to this one place and I hit this new level.

2246
01:59:48.610 --> 01:59:53.610
It's like I was like this really good local guy and then I went and I watched

2247
01:59:53.831 --> 01:59:56.020
the world championships or the world cup rather,

2248
01:59:56.140 --> 01:59:58.990
and then all of a sudden I was like,
world class,
you know,
it was,

2249
01:59:59.050 --> 02:00:02.740
it happened like overnight.
It happens so quick.
It was,
it was,

2250
02:00:02.741 --> 02:00:07.210
I realized what was possible.
I saw those guys move and I went,
oh,

2251
02:00:07.211 --> 02:00:09.340
you can move faster,
you could do this more,

2252
02:00:09.341 --> 02:00:13.660
you could do that more and but just by having a new model in my mind,

2253
02:00:13.870 --> 02:00:17.680
my physical body caught up to that model.
Like almost instantly.

2254
02:00:17.750 --> 02:00:21.400
It was like I had already had the physical capability,
but I hadn't seen it yet.

2255
02:00:21.460 --> 02:00:23.740
So I didn't know where my ma,
you know,

2256
02:00:23.770 --> 02:00:26.500
I didn't know what was possible until it was shown to me.
Yeah.

2257
02:00:26.501 --> 02:00:30.400
You had a barrier based off your body and then you saw,
you saw that did that,

2258
02:00:30.430 --> 02:00:32.710
that bar can be raised when,
okay,
I'll just go up there now.

2259
02:00:32.810 --> 02:00:35.890
I also saw that those guys would fuck me up.
I,
you know,
when you,

2260
02:00:35.891 --> 02:00:38.440
when you watch things objective,
Lee,
if you're a competitor,

2261
02:00:38.620 --> 02:00:42.700
the most important part of getting better is you got to know how bad you are

2262
02:00:42.701 --> 02:00:44.440
right now.
You've got to know what you suck at.

2263
02:00:44.470 --> 02:00:47.260
You got to know where your holes are.
You got to know what mistakes you make.

2264
02:00:47.261 --> 02:00:49.660
And if you don't see that,
the enemy can see that.

2265
02:00:49.661 --> 02:00:52.420
I can see that in other people immediately.
And I'm like,
man,

2266
02:00:52.421 --> 02:00:55.510
if I can't see that in myself,
that's a fucking horrible,
horrible handicap.

2267
02:00:55.840 --> 02:00:59.200
So you look at these guys and I went and washed his guys.
Remember?
Like going,

2268
02:00:59.201 --> 02:01:02.140
this guy would fuck me up.
This guy would fuck me up.
That guy would knock me out.

2269
02:01:02.410 --> 02:01:04.840
I was like,
this guy wouldn't want to fight with them.
I was like,
Shit.

2270
02:01:04.841 --> 02:01:06.910
And I just realized that there is a whole,

2271
02:01:07.180 --> 02:01:10.300
so all of a sudden I was doing things that I could never do before.

2272
02:01:10.630 --> 02:01:14.010
And I remember thinking like,
what was holding me back?

2273
02:01:14.040 --> 02:01:15.610
Was it just that I hadn't seen it?

2274
02:01:15.940 --> 02:01:18.010
And then I remember the thing about the four minute mile,

2275
02:01:18.011 --> 02:01:18.950
nobody thought we could ever,

2276
02:01:19.070 --> 02:01:22.210
a human being could ever run faster than a four minute mile.
It's just,

2277
02:01:22.211 --> 02:01:23.620
it wasn't beyond our capabilities.

2278
02:01:23.740 --> 02:01:26.550
Then one guy did it and then all of a sudden a gang of people did it like

2279
02:01:26.620 --> 02:01:27.453
immediately.

2280
02:01:27.670 --> 02:01:32.620
It's like all of a sudden these new levels get set and new barriers get broken.

2281
02:01:32.770 --> 02:01:35.650
There's,
there's something to it that's not just physical.

2282
02:01:35.651 --> 02:01:38.980
There's something to it where the,
the belief and the,
the,

2283
02:01:39.020 --> 02:01:42.640
when the mind has new information,
it changes the reality.

2284
02:01:43.730 --> 02:01:48.100
<v 1>So where do you draw the line in?
If you say [inaudible],</v>

2285
02:01:48.670 --> 02:01:50.030
if you can say,
all right,

2286
02:01:50.031 --> 02:01:52.790
someone who has this belief for someone who has these thoughts that that

2287
02:01:52.791 --> 02:01:55.010
empowers them and it's positive for them.
When do you go,
well,

2288
02:01:55.011 --> 02:01:57.580
but your belief is wrong.
You know,
the,
the,

2289
02:01:57.610 --> 02:01:59.720
the one that you have that empowers you and,
and,

2290
02:01:59.770 --> 02:02:03.140
and propels you in positive directions that you,
you know,

2291
02:02:03.170 --> 02:02:05.870
that you give credit to for the positivity in your life.
When do you go?
Okay,

2292
02:02:05.871 --> 02:02:06.531
well that's wrong though,

2293
02:02:06.531 --> 02:02:09.590
because I could question it doesn't exist or because I can prove that it was

2294
02:02:09.591 --> 02:02:13.070
made up by somebody,
you know,
at what point then you have the right to say that.

2295
02:02:13.160 --> 02:02:16.920
<v 0>Is that someone else's belief?
You don't,
well a lot of people look,
you know,</v>

2296
02:02:16.930 --> 02:02:20.470
whether it's the flying spaghetti monster or whether it's uh,
you know,

2297
02:02:20.560 --> 02:02:24.010
the Mormonism,
the Morrisons your entity or,
or a Camry,
a bracelet.
Yeah.

2298
02:02:24.310 --> 02:02:28.960
There's something that is empowering about having belief.

2299
02:02:29.350 --> 02:02:30.670
And I've seen people,

2300
02:02:30.730 --> 02:02:33.640
one of the things I was scared of when I was a kid and I was competing,

2301
02:02:33.641 --> 02:02:36.600
I was so scared is competing against religious guys.
Cause I,

2302
02:02:36.601 --> 02:02:40.170
I felt like they believe something more than I did have a god.
I was wondering.

2303
02:02:40.280 --> 02:02:43.810
Yeah,
I was filled with doubt about,
about,
you know,

2304
02:02:43.811 --> 02:02:47.540
I was an idiot first of all.
And I was filled with doubt about,
you know,

2305
02:02:47.560 --> 02:02:50.770
what would happen when I die,
my mortality,
whether I'm a good person or not.

2306
02:02:51.010 --> 02:02:52.300
And I would meet people that were like,

2307
02:02:52.450 --> 02:02:54.700
when I would see guys like reading the Bible before they would fight,

2308
02:02:54.701 --> 02:02:56.980
it would scare the shit out of me.
And it was like one thing that really,

2309
02:02:56.981 --> 02:02:59.190
there's a guy named Clayton,
I think it was in his Clayton Barber,

2310
02:02:59.360 --> 02:03:03.160
who is one of the top level guys in,
in my division.
And he was,
uh,

2311
02:03:03.210 --> 02:03:05.200
he was an army guy and he was super religious.

2312
02:03:05.201 --> 02:03:08.140
It was like super nit scared the shit out of me.
I was terrified of him.

2313
02:03:08.320 --> 02:03:10.630
He wasn't even the most dangerous guy.
He's just,
to me,

2314
02:03:10.631 --> 02:03:15.070
he was scary because he was too religious.
It was just too creepy.
A lot of people

2315
02:03:15.340 --> 02:03:15.860
<v 1>do,
you know,</v>

2316
02:03:15.860 --> 02:03:19.030
a lot of people say that religion is what compels them to do great things.

2317
02:03:19.040 --> 02:03:20.740
Religion is also strong enough to come to,

2318
02:03:20.750 --> 02:03:23.580
to have them fly planes into buildings.
So if that,
if,
if,

2319
02:03:23.590 --> 02:03:26.870
if a book and a and a philosophy can make somebody do that,

2320
02:03:27.020 --> 02:03:28.610
Lord knows what it can make them do to you when the ring,

2321
02:03:28.710 --> 02:03:31.050
<v 4>when you say fly planes into buildings,</v>

2322
02:03:31.051 --> 02:03:33.390
you're completely discounting what we have.

2323
02:03:33.391 --> 02:03:36.480
The documents that show remote control planes.

2324
02:03:36.481 --> 02:03:39.680
And the only way you can get a plane to make those kinds of turns,

2325
02:03:40.660 --> 02:03:42.850
<v 0>there's too much information.
Do you believe that?</v>

2326
02:03:43.270 --> 02:03:47.390
How much corruption do you believe there is in nine 11?
Um,
I don't know.
I,

2327
02:03:47.490 --> 02:03:50.800
but all I know is what did I do that is from,

2328
02:03:50.801 --> 02:03:53.380
what was the hell was that a Pandora's box?
Did I,
did I just,
yeah,

2329
02:03:53.381 --> 02:03:56.360
he wants to talk about farts.
That's what it means.
Don't worry.

2330
02:03:57.380 --> 02:04:01.000
We can talk about old garden.
There's,
there's corruption in government.
No,

2331
02:04:01.030 --> 02:04:01.810
no question about it.

2332
02:04:01.810 --> 02:04:05.290
All you need to know is there's no reason to ever tell you the exact story.

2333
02:04:05.770 --> 02:04:08.860
So any story that happens,
whether it's the way we killed Osama bin Ladin,

2334
02:04:08.861 --> 02:04:09.461
which by the way,

2335
02:04:09.461 --> 02:04:14.461
we've already had a difference in the story from one of the actual seals who was

2336
02:04:15.290 --> 02:04:17.470
onsite who killed Osama bin.

2337
02:04:17.471 --> 02:04:21.100
Ladin there's a difference between his story and the official story that the

2338
02:04:21.101 --> 02:04:23.880
government has put out.
Did you read that book?
No,
I didn't keep in.

2339
02:04:23.920 --> 02:04:28.540
Now when you go back into the past and look at the Pat Tillman story and you

2340
02:04:28.541 --> 02:04:32.500
realize that they lied about what happened to the American hero and football

2341
02:04:32.501 --> 02:04:34.990
star,
Pat Tillman,
who was killed by friendly fire,

2342
02:04:35.200 --> 02:04:39.900
who they think may have been actually because he was complaining too much about

2343
02:04:39.901 --> 02:04:40.530
the war.

2344
02:04:40.530 --> 02:04:43.050
He was a real patriot who went over there because he thought he was going to

2345
02:04:43.051 --> 02:04:44.610
defend us against the terrorists.

2346
02:04:44.760 --> 02:04:47.670
And when he got there and realized it was a massive cluster fuck and was talking

2347
02:04:47.671 --> 02:04:51.510
about it quite openly.
And then he gets shagged by shacked,

2348
02:04:51.540 --> 02:04:55.490
no Shang frack frack fracks at work.
Um,

2349
02:04:55.620 --> 02:04:59.580
he gets killed and they make a total lie.
Lie,
lie.

2350
02:04:59.790 --> 02:05:01.700
Jessica Lynch was another story.
Jessica Lynch,

2351
02:05:01.701 --> 02:05:04.320
who was a woman that they said they had to take out in an,
you know,

2352
02:05:04.330 --> 02:05:09.090
an armed insertion to remove her from,
you know,
her.

2353
02:05:09.510 --> 02:05:14.010
She was rescued by a,
you know,
a high level guys when she was being kidnapped,

2354
02:05:14.160 --> 02:05:17.130
she wasn't being kidnapped.
She was being,
she was in a hospital being treated.

2355
02:05:17.520 --> 02:05:22.370
The whole,
they lie,
they just lie.
And I don't think it's,

2356
02:05:22.440 --> 02:05:23.670
I'm not blaming soldiers.

2357
02:05:23.970 --> 02:05:28.200
I'm blaming the very people at the top of the command who are doing this,

2358
02:05:28.201 --> 02:05:31.890
who've always been doing it like this.
They did it since operation dirty trick.

2359
02:05:32.090 --> 02:05:36.000
You know,
when John Glenn first went into space,
if John Glenn died,

2360
02:05:36.060 --> 02:05:39.810
they were going to blame it on the Cubans.
They were going to concoct evidence,

2361
02:05:39.811 --> 02:05:41.880
and this is all been proven right?
There were concoct evidence,

2362
02:05:41.881 --> 02:05:44.040
they're going to blame it on the Cubans and they were going to go,
well,
look,

2363
02:05:44.070 --> 02:05:47.100
we've got a win win situation here.
I send this fucking guy in the orbit.

2364
02:05:47.580 --> 02:05:49.880
If he blows up,
we just go fuck up Cuba,
right?

2365
02:05:49.980 --> 02:05:51.960
And everybody's happy and called the catalyst.

2366
02:05:51.990 --> 02:05:56.940
It's called the way people who have ultimate control run business.
You know,

2367
02:05:56.941 --> 02:05:59.010
this,
this country has always been run by that.

2368
02:05:59.011 --> 02:06:04.011
So when something like nine one one happens and you look at all the potential

2369
02:06:04.441 --> 02:06:08.780
fuckery that could have taken place from the fact that people were,
um,

2370
02:06:08.820 --> 02:06:12.050
gambling and betting on,
uh,

2371
02:06:12.150 --> 02:06:16.170
airlines failing right after or right before it happened,

2372
02:06:16.171 --> 02:06:19.620
that there was a massive amount of money that was,
was moved around,

2373
02:06:19.790 --> 02:06:22.820
<v 1>insurance policies taken out for building the area.</v>

2374
02:06:22.821 --> 02:06:27.770
And the fact that evidence was destroyed minutes after the event to indicate

2375
02:06:27.771 --> 02:06:28.970
that there's a lot of room

2376
02:06:29.160 --> 02:06:34.020
<v 0>potential fuckery.
And if you add that to what we know has happened in the past,</v>

2377
02:06:34.470 --> 02:06:36.900
I throw my hands up and I go,
I don't know.
I don't,

2378
02:06:36.901 --> 02:06:38.220
I don't really know what happened,

2379
02:06:38.221 --> 02:06:42.390
but I am not willing to ever stop and say that the government is on this

2380
02:06:42.570 --> 02:06:47.340
occasion is telling 100% of the truth that even though they haven't done it in

2381
02:06:47.341 --> 02:06:50.520
the past,
and even though they'd been lying about the Iran Contra scandal,

2382
02:06:50.670 --> 02:06:54.690
and even though they lied about virtually every fucking thing that has ever

2383
02:06:54.691 --> 02:06:58.920
happened overseas,
whether it's,
you know,
fucking Gulf of Tonkin,

2384
02:06:58.921 --> 02:07:03.921
whether it's the reason why they pulled all their battleships out of World War

2385
02:07:03.960 --> 02:07:06.240
II,
out of,
um,
out of,
uh,

2386
02:07:06.330 --> 02:07:10.260
<v 1>Pearl Harbor,
we knew before it happens.
They led it,
they receive notice.
They,</v>

2387
02:07:10.270 --> 02:07:12.570
we needed a catalyst to get us involved in that war.

2388
02:07:12.910 --> 02:07:15.130
<v 0>I sold that to g Gordon Liddy.
I said,
you know,</v>

2389
02:07:15.131 --> 02:07:16.450
they were saying that on the history channel.

2390
02:07:16.480 --> 02:07:19.720
I had g Gordon Liddy was on fear factor.
He almost won.

2391
02:07:19.750 --> 02:07:22.910
You just can't see at night.
It's fucking notionally sucks.
Yeah.
See,

2392
02:07:22.920 --> 02:07:27.130
crash his car.
He'd have to eat weird shit.
Or who's the guy who won?

2393
02:07:27.131 --> 02:07:29.010
He was like a fucking,
he,

2394
02:07:29.030 --> 02:07:32.170
he was like a really big star in,

2395
02:07:32.200 --> 02:07:36.460
in the like the seventies and then he became drug addict too.
It's like a,

2396
02:07:36.960 --> 02:07:40.390
God damn it can't remember his fucking name.

2397
02:07:41.380 --> 02:07:42.213
Shit.

2398
02:07:42.670 --> 02:07:45.520
<v 2>It's like some,
a weird obscure guy,
some singer guy.
All right.</v>

2399
02:07:45.850 --> 02:07:49.240
I want to say Jared Leto but it's not him.
He is not obscure.

2400
02:07:49.241 --> 02:07:52.150
His music is powerful.
Amazing.
His music moves mountains,

2401
02:07:52.320 --> 02:07:56.280
but it's like that kind of a guy but a g chord.

2402
02:07:56.340 --> 02:08:00.210
<v 0>Liddy you know,
I had a conversation with him about it.
He's like,
oh,
I don't know.</v>

2403
02:08:00.211 --> 02:08:01.100
I don't believe that's true.

2404
02:08:01.140 --> 02:08:04.110
But so what they're saying on the history channel history.
Yeah.

2405
02:08:04.320 --> 02:08:07.770
It's like they're,
they're saying that they're decoded Japanese.
Uh,

2406
02:08:07.771 --> 02:08:11.610
that's one of the reasons why they left certain ships and they took out like

2407
02:08:11.640 --> 02:08:13.390
some of the big battleships they got,

2408
02:08:13.620 --> 02:08:16.620
like they allowed that to happen so that we could have an excuse to get into

2409
02:08:16.621 --> 02:08:17.454
World War II,

2410
02:08:17.550 --> 02:08:20.850
which ultimately I guess it was probably a good thing and it would suck if the

2411
02:08:20.851 --> 02:08:22.020
Nazis actually did win.

2412
02:08:22.520 --> 02:08:25.290
It means is that possible that we can have like a fucking star wars type

2413
02:08:25.291 --> 02:08:27.990
situation where the,
you know,
with the Nazis,

2414
02:08:27.991 --> 02:08:31.100
like get into a position where they can have a fucking death star.
You know?

2415
02:08:31.140 --> 02:08:31.973
I mean,

2416
02:08:32.230 --> 02:08:33.700
<v 2>we're building our way towards it.
We're going to,</v>

2417
02:08:33.701 --> 02:08:35.590
we're going to build the death star.
We've already got flying drones

2418
02:08:37.260 --> 02:08:38.920
already got the drones.
We're getting there,
man.
Yeah.

2419
02:08:38.921 --> 02:08:40.390
They didn't even think of that.
And Star Wars,

2420
02:08:40.391 --> 02:08:42.400
they didn't think they'd be 30,000 drones in the air.

2421
02:08:42.580 --> 02:08:44.530
Why would you need people in these tie fighters and x swing?

2422
02:08:44.540 --> 02:08:46.150
Star wars didn't even have Google note.

2423
02:08:46.330 --> 02:08:48.450
They didn't even have Google on star wars.
They had to divorce.

2424
02:08:48.500 --> 02:08:51.530
They didn't need it,
man.
They had the force pretty the liberal.

2425
02:08:51.610 --> 02:08:54.550
You got the force to the force is what we were talking about.
Yeah.

2426
02:08:54.820 --> 02:08:58.520
The force is the belief and the ability to,
to accomplish things.

2427
02:08:58.521 --> 02:09:00.150
It's funny on the power of like positive thought.

2428
02:09:00.151 --> 02:09:03.090
It used to be one of those guys that was,
um,
and it wasn't,

2429
02:09:03.110 --> 02:09:07.210
I wasn't something I was consciously doing,
but in,
in my youth I was,

2430
02:09:07.270 --> 02:09:11.530
I would be jealous of people that had success or sometimes be angry that someone

2431
02:09:11.531 --> 02:09:15.630
did something creative as opposed to appreciating that and supporting them and

2432
02:09:15.640 --> 02:09:17.380
being genuinely excited for them.

2433
02:09:17.530 --> 02:09:21.370
And I had to root that out of myself and examine that and go,

2434
02:09:21.371 --> 02:09:23.050
where is this coming from?
And you know,

2435
02:09:23.051 --> 02:09:24.670
seeds of insecurity and all sorts of stuff.

2436
02:09:24.760 --> 02:09:28.690
And once I was able to look at it for what it was that sunlight disinfected it.

2437
02:09:29.080 --> 02:09:32.560
And now being genuinely excited for people that are doing awesome things and

2438
02:09:32.561 --> 02:09:35.470
being positive about that has fundamentally changed my life.

2439
02:09:35.860 --> 02:09:39.380
And I've seen that and only the last few years so fully subscribed to,

2440
02:09:39.460 --> 02:09:42.970
I have talked about that on this podcast many,
many,
many,
many times.

2441
02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:46.470
The difference between the way I looked at things as a young man who hadn't

2442
02:09:46.480 --> 02:09:49.510
really accomplished much or you know,
was really insecure too.

2443
02:09:49.511 --> 02:09:53.320
The way I handled things now and somewhere along the line I sort of figured it

2444
02:09:53.321 --> 02:09:57.640
out.
Somewhere in my twenties I figured out that it was just a weakness,
but I,

2445
02:09:57.641 --> 02:09:59.380
I'm really self critical.

2446
02:09:59.380 --> 02:10:01.960
So I had pointed that out and so I would see that in other people where they

2447
02:10:01.961 --> 02:10:05.050
would be hating on other folks and I'd be like,
man,
you're fucking yourself.

2448
02:10:05.051 --> 02:10:06.430
You don't even realize you're fucking right.

2449
02:10:06.431 --> 02:10:10.690
So we should all be elevating ourselves,
all of us.
And uh,
you know,

2450
02:10:10.691 --> 02:10:15.610
that sort of became the idea of what we do with this whole crew of us that we

2451
02:10:15.611 --> 02:10:17.620
call the Dell squad.
I mean,
that's really what it is.

2452
02:10:17.621 --> 02:10:22.120
It's like we all support each other and we all like get psyched for each other.

2453
02:10:22.121 --> 02:10:26.780
There's no one like Ari Shaffir right now is number one on iTunes bitches.
Yeah.

2454
02:10:27.270 --> 02:10:30.970
And Yeah,
we talked about it yesterday on the podcast and boom,

2455
02:10:30.971 --> 02:10:33.860
his new CD is number one and it's fucking hilarious.

2456
02:10:33.861 --> 02:10:35.940
Ari's worked very hard and we,

2457
02:10:35.990 --> 02:10:39.920
we started taking him on the road when he was basically he was an employee at

2458
02:10:39.921 --> 02:10:44.510
the comedy store and he was just starting to do like real like 15 and 20 minutes

2459
02:10:44.511 --> 02:10:46.130
sets the many,
many,
many years ago.

2460
02:10:46.310 --> 02:10:50.240
So to see him now headline and like major clubs and having the number one CD on

2461
02:10:50.241 --> 02:10:53.570
Itunes,
it's fucking amazing.
But that pumps us all up,
you know.

2462
02:10:53.750 --> 02:10:57.410
And number two is Tommy said Gaura and number who's also our buddy and what is

2463
02:10:57.411 --> 02:11:00.350
his white girls with cornrows,
which is hilarious.

2464
02:11:00.530 --> 02:11:03.290
Tom Score is one of the best fucking comics in the country right now.

2465
02:11:03.291 --> 02:11:06.650
He's so underrated.
He is fucking hilarious from everything.

2466
02:11:06.651 --> 02:11:08.690
I have to check it out.
Oh my God,
he's funny.
He's,

2467
02:11:08.900 --> 02:11:12.320
and he's a great guy and his shit is number two.

2468
02:11:12.321 --> 02:11:15.350
And then Joey Diaz is like number three or number four and Joey's been number

2469
02:11:15.351 --> 02:11:20.000
one for months.
It's,
it's incredible.
But it,
it benefits all of us.

2470
02:11:20.001 --> 02:11:23.300
It pumps us all up starting a podcast your next way you fought doing,

2471
02:11:23.750 --> 02:11:26.450
how do we do it on Photoshop?
Dude,

2472
02:11:26.590 --> 02:11:30.590
going to giving it as Kevin Pereira gets shit done.
Let's do it next week.
Yes,

2473
02:11:30.710 --> 02:11:32.720
I see.
Yes.
I love this.

2474
02:11:33.080 --> 02:11:37.040
Excellent fits to the man that together at nighttime,
Kevin Pereira,

2475
02:11:37.041 --> 02:11:39.550
you were officially desk squad.
Now I love it.
You're in.
Is there a,

2476
02:11:39.551 --> 02:11:43.610
is there a tee shirt sent us a picture of you got a hug,
Brian?

2477
02:11:44.290 --> 02:11:46.100
It's uncomfortable after the first 30 minutes,

2478
02:11:46.101 --> 02:11:49.410
but instead of prolonging the whole trick,
I like them for one,
one hour.

2479
02:11:49.440 --> 02:11:51.970
He go through stages of emotion.
Like he'll cry for a little bit.

2480
02:11:51.971 --> 02:11:53.840
I don't get aroused and don't get angry.
Well,

2481
02:11:53.841 --> 02:11:56.960
he'll start telling stories of his youth though you will think are made up.

2482
02:11:59.690 --> 02:12:03.140
Yeah,
you have to do it.
We,
you know,
it's,
it's,

2483
02:12:03.190 --> 02:12:07.370
it's very hard for people who don't have things going on in their life to be

2484
02:12:07.371 --> 02:12:11.900
happy for people.
Who Do you gotta be?
You gotta use that shit is inspiration,
man.

2485
02:12:11.901 --> 02:12:15.530
When you see someone win an Emmy and you're like,
I need to write a script,

2486
02:12:15.680 --> 02:12:17.330
get up and write that fucking script.

2487
02:12:17.480 --> 02:12:22.340
Don't hate on the guy who created sex in the city or the woman who grade.

2488
02:12:22.341 --> 02:12:24.890
I don't know if those,
you know,
I don't know why I said sex and the city.

2489
02:12:24.891 --> 02:12:27.430
What am I living in their fucking,
I just went back and Todd,

2490
02:12:27.440 --> 02:12:28.940
it's a phenomenal theory.
Don't,

2491
02:12:29.060 --> 02:12:33.380
don't hate on Louis C K for just winning two Emmys that yeah,
it's awesome,

2492
02:12:33.381 --> 02:12:35.870
but love the shot of him in the crowd with the two Emmy's at his feet and he's

2493
02:12:35.871 --> 02:12:37.290
just tweeting.
Yeah.
I don't know if you've seen that.

2494
02:12:37.820 --> 02:12:41.660
It's almost like it could care less,
but you know,
but he's just,
yeah,
well,

2495
02:12:41.661 --> 02:12:42.530
you know,
he's,

2496
02:12:42.650 --> 02:12:46.850
he's the real deal and he's a hard working guy and so you should be excited

2497
02:12:46.851 --> 02:12:49.310
about that.
You should see that guy and you shouldn't say,
man,

2498
02:12:49.311 --> 02:12:52.460
he's got this going on and I can't even get a middle spot.
You know,

2499
02:12:52.880 --> 02:12:55.880
you gotta just gotta work,
match,
just got to work,
you know.

2500
02:12:56.510 --> 02:13:00.380
But you'll find it gets a lot easier to do that work and you find a lot more

2501
02:13:00.381 --> 02:13:03.680
support when you're not pissed at people and jealous for their success.

2502
02:13:03.681 --> 02:13:06.350
It makes you way better and it's easier to be creative.

2503
02:13:06.380 --> 02:13:10.550
The one of the hardest parts of being creative is if you're in in tension with

2504
02:13:10.551 --> 02:13:13.940
someone or you have issues or you're jealous or you're,

2505
02:13:13.941 --> 02:13:15.530
you have any sort of negativity.

2506
02:13:15.531 --> 02:13:18.320
It's very difficult to be creative with any sort of negativity in your life

2507
02:13:18.620 --> 02:13:21.080
because you know,
that becomes the blaring focus.

2508
02:13:21.081 --> 02:13:25.220
Instead of letting the mind relax and go into these weird sort of patterns of

2509
02:13:25.221 --> 02:13:28.610
thoughts that create creativity,
especially comedic create.

2510
02:13:29.030 --> 02:13:32.100
You can create great music because you're pissed at an ex girlfriend or you have

2511
02:13:32.100 --> 02:13:34.830
<v 1>a heroin problem,
but it's really hard to make comedy.
I mean,</v>

2512
02:13:34.860 --> 02:13:37.320
how many great songs been written by Dudes who are just trying to get a girl

2513
02:13:37.321 --> 02:13:41.160
back?
Probably a lot,
right?
Countless.
It's so sad.
I love that.

2514
02:13:41.360 --> 02:13:44.880
Then I'd also love that drugs have shaped the design and sound of music

2515
02:13:44.881 --> 02:13:48.030
throughout time.
Like there've been,
there's been studies that show that,
you know,

2516
02:13:48.031 --> 02:13:50.790
cocaine makes you more sensitive to higher frequencies and that's why a lot of

2517
02:13:50.791 --> 02:13:53.970
the music from the 80s had the trouble blasted way up cause dudes were just

2518
02:13:54.180 --> 02:13:57.690
blown out on coke at the mixing board.
Go.
Yeah,
give me that symbol.

2519
02:13:57.800 --> 02:13:59.670
Give me that guitar screen.
My end.

2520
02:14:01.470 --> 02:14:04.080
I just finished the dirt off the teacher at the Motley Crue store,

2521
02:14:04.140 --> 02:14:07.650
the Motley Crue tales.
Have you read that?
It's brilliant.

2522
02:14:07.670 --> 02:14:10.230
Really brilliant is really,
Neil Strauss wrote it.

2523
02:14:10.231 --> 02:14:12.660
I mean it's very well written and it tells you the prospect,

2524
02:14:12.661 --> 02:14:15.090
I'm not even a motley crew fan,
I barely know their music.

2525
02:14:15.270 --> 02:14:19.080
But the stories in here seem unbelievable that as you flip the page you'll get

2526
02:14:19.081 --> 02:14:22.050
the same tale.
But from another band member's perspective.

2527
02:14:22.400 --> 02:14:26.860
So by the third chapter you've got real perspective on incidents that happened

2528
02:14:26.861 --> 02:14:30.390
of like girls being stuffed into litter boxes and guys,
Oh Dang.

2529
02:14:30.391 --> 02:14:33.000
In the back of cars.
Oh yeah,
like crazy shit.

2530
02:14:33.150 --> 02:14:35.850
Blow jobs and private jets while people are overdosing.

2531
02:14:35.990 --> 02:14:40.740
It's just rock and roll as rock and roll gets.
Wow.
That's the program by the way.

2532
02:14:40.741 --> 02:14:43.030
You were taught.
Oh,
the one that stitches,
stitches.
Everything in your diet.

2533
02:14:43.070 --> 02:14:45.150
That's another one because that is definitely not the name of it and that's

2534
02:14:45.151 --> 02:14:46.800
awesome.
Yeah.
You why clothes?

2535
02:14:47.950 --> 02:14:52.230
<v 2>There's work on all platforms.
It was an apple store.</v>

2536
02:14:52.240 --> 02:14:54.150
Look at that fake iPhone that shows it.

2537
02:14:54.420 --> 02:14:57.280
<v 3>See,
these are a bunch of people connecting.</v>

2538
02:14:58.950 --> 02:15:00.660
How great is that?
That's amazing.

2539
02:15:01.470 --> 02:15:04.620
But that song sucks up back at deck talking about man,

2540
02:15:04.950 --> 02:15:08.710
<v 2>so that was dope.
The fuck was that when a vista social club.
Amazing.</v>

2541
02:15:08.860 --> 02:15:10.350
Speaking of songs,
everybody keeps asking me,

2542
02:15:10.351 --> 02:15:12.700
when is this fucking into the world party tickets going on sale.

2543
02:15:12.970 --> 02:15:16.840
They're going on sale this Friday and it'd be honey,
honey,

2544
02:15:17.110 --> 02:15:20.920
Joe Diaz,
Doug,
Stan hope and myself.

2545
02:15:20.921 --> 02:15:25.120
December 21st,
2012 at the Wiltern theater in La.

2546
02:15:25.390 --> 02:15:29.680
Come celebrate the end of the world.
Bitches.
We're going down swinging.

2547
02:15:29.950 --> 02:15:32.020
We're going down with mushrooms and whiskey.

2548
02:15:33.400 --> 02:15:37.240
That's what we're going to throw him out to the crowd,
like fusing messages.

2549
02:15:37.270 --> 02:15:39.530
Johnny look,
this is the a,

2550
02:15:39.550 --> 02:15:43.540
this is the big date that all these crazy people and Terence Mckenna had been

2551
02:15:43.541 --> 02:15:46.000
predicting of some real change and I don't,

2552
02:15:46.001 --> 02:15:48.730
I don't believe that anything real is going to happen unless maybe we make

2553
02:15:48.731 --> 02:15:52.000
something real happen.
You are the one,
you know,
maybe you're the reason,

2554
02:15:54.230 --> 02:15:55.290
but dude,

2555
02:15:56.100 --> 02:15:56.933
<v 1>Gotcha.</v>

2556
02:15:58.360 --> 02:15:58.600
<v 2>God,</v>

2557
02:15:58.600 --> 02:16:01.050
what is going to happen though is we're going to have a good fucking time and

2558
02:16:01.051 --> 02:16:02.910
Stan hope and I,
when we first talking about,
yeah,

2559
02:16:02.911 --> 02:16:05.940
December 21st that's the end of the Mayan calendar.
That's the,
that's the day.

2560
02:16:06.180 --> 02:16:09.750
The day end of the long count.
Not going to see 30 you will,

2561
02:16:10.020 --> 02:16:12.630
it's not going to end.
It's all going at,
no,
I don't buy it.

2562
02:16:12.720 --> 02:16:14.730
I think we're going to pull it out.
You know what I think,

2563
02:16:14.731 --> 02:16:19.731
I think there's a battle right now between idiocy and technology and I firmly

2564
02:16:20.371 --> 02:16:23.310
believe that things improve and without any sorts of,

2565
02:16:23.400 --> 02:16:27.720
if we can avoid nuclear war and cataclysmic impacts by,
you know,

2566
02:16:28.630 --> 02:16:30.340
asteroids and super

2567
02:16:30.350 --> 02:16:32.290
<v 0>volcanoes,
shit along those lines.</v>

2568
02:16:32.470 --> 02:16:36.730
But we also have to accept the fact that the more data comes in,

2569
02:16:37.030 --> 02:16:41.080
the more we realize there's certain parts of the planet that are habitable and

2570
02:16:41.081 --> 02:16:45.370
then become inhabitable and we have to fucking accept that and we need to start

2571
02:16:45.371 --> 02:16:50.350
thinking about that here in southern California when it gets 110 fucking 30 40

2572
02:16:50.351 --> 02:16:53.630
50 days in a row,
at a certain point in time you've got to go,
what if,

2573
02:16:53.750 --> 02:16:57.120
what if it gets to one 30 what if he gets the one 50 right?
What are we doing?

2574
02:16:57.130 --> 02:17:00.460
We're going to stay here and like wear suits on our way to the,
you know,

2575
02:17:00.461 --> 02:17:02.260
everywhere we go so that we stay alive

2576
02:17:02.490 --> 02:17:04.890
<v 1>like a gray aliens sleeve.
We'll have to be buying this from an apple.</v>

2577
02:17:04.940 --> 02:17:07.910
<v 0>What are we going to do if the,
if,
if there really is,</v>

2578
02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:12.320
this is the precursor to an ice age and what if the shift comes like in dramatic

2579
02:17:12.321 --> 02:17:15.560
form,
like they believe it has all throughout history,

2580
02:17:15.561 --> 02:17:18.950
like the end of the last ice age abruptly happened,

2581
02:17:18.951 --> 02:17:23.450
including massive extinction events like the wooly mammoths,
saber tooth tiger,

2582
02:17:23.451 --> 02:17:26.330
all sorts of animals just disappeared off the face of the earth.

2583
02:17:26.750 --> 02:17:30.920
And we got to accept the fact that that shit could happen here just because we

2584
02:17:30.921 --> 02:17:35.060
have a database of a couple of thousand years of civilization and all living in

2585
02:17:35.061 --> 02:17:36.110
the same continents.

2586
02:17:36.320 --> 02:17:40.820
We also have a fucking map of Greenland that they don't really understand where

2587
02:17:40.821 --> 02:17:43.490
these people,
excuse me,
not Greenland,
Antarctica.

2588
02:17:43.610 --> 02:17:48.610
There's a map of Antarctica that came from the 15 hundreds that is a very

2589
02:17:49.131 --> 02:17:53.660
detailed map of the perimeter and it's correct and they don't know who the fuck

2590
02:17:53.661 --> 02:17:54.800
charted this thing because,

2591
02:17:54.820 --> 02:17:59.570
and Arctic has been frozen for God knows how long and they the the,

2592
02:17:59.571 --> 02:18:03.370
the suspicion is that some point in time and Arco is actually inhabitable,

2593
02:18:03.371 --> 02:18:03.830
habitable.

2594
02:18:03.830 --> 02:18:06.740
And there's all these sites that say there's pyramids on Antarctica that they're

2595
02:18:06.741 --> 02:18:09.530
discovering,
but I don't know.
I don't buy that.
If it seems like fuckery,

2596
02:18:09.810 --> 02:18:13.620
it seems like some horse shit.
It'll yeti homes.
Yeah.
But I'm not,
I'm,
I'm,

2597
02:18:13.621 --> 02:18:17.090
I'm completely convinced that in the course of human history,

2598
02:18:17.091 --> 02:18:20.810
the hundreds of thousands of years that have been things that are remotely close

2599
02:18:20.811 --> 02:18:23.360
to what we look like,
we've had to flee.
You know,

2600
02:18:23.361 --> 02:18:27.170
we've had to get the North America was covered at nice a mile high sheet of ice.

2601
02:18:27.171 --> 02:18:31.030
The Great Lakes are created by all of this giant boulders removed this,

2602
02:18:31.250 --> 02:18:33.770
this huge slab of ice comes down.

2603
02:18:33.771 --> 02:18:36.890
It's a mile high and it pushes slowly across the land,

2604
02:18:37.010 --> 02:18:40.070
literally erasing everything and its site.
You gotta get the fuck out of there,

2605
02:18:40.280 --> 02:18:42.560
you know?
And that,
that easily could happen to us again.

2606
02:18:42.620 --> 02:18:45.680
<v 1>It's interesting to think like if there were another catastrophic environmental</v>

2607
02:18:45.681 --> 02:18:47.680
event that wiped us out,
if,

2608
02:18:47.770 --> 02:18:52.070
if thousands of years go on and another human civilization and spawn and birth

2609
02:18:52.180 --> 02:18:55.190
like what relics they would find because they might not ever know that we

2610
02:18:55.220 --> 02:18:56.030
developed the Internet,

2611
02:18:56.030 --> 02:18:58.750
that we had iPhones that we had anything else they would get,
you know,

2612
02:18:58.860 --> 02:19:01.370
guns maybe,
maybe a clay pot or two,

2613
02:19:01.490 --> 02:19:04.430
but they would really have a knowledge of our civilization because of the way

2614
02:19:04.431 --> 02:19:05.150
we're storing it.
Yep.
What

2615
02:19:05.150 --> 02:19:07.400
<v 0>the fuck?
Yeah,
they would be fucked.
There was,
yeah.</v>

2616
02:19:07.430 --> 02:19:11.070
Well that's exactly what they believe happened to the people that built Baalbek

2617
02:19:11.150 --> 02:19:15.830
in Lebanon where they have these 10 foot tall stones are 7,100 feet long and

2618
02:19:15.831 --> 02:19:17.570
they don't even know why the fuck they got them there.

2619
02:19:17.571 --> 02:19:19.940
And they don't even know when they got them there.
They have no idea.

2620
02:19:20.360 --> 02:19:24.220
And that's the,
the really extreme people that believe in the,
the,

2621
02:19:24.221 --> 02:19:27.110
the ancient civilizations advancement,
they,
that's their,

2622
02:19:27.560 --> 02:19:32.220
that we lost all the glass and metal and all gets absorbed.
You know,
we,
uh,

2623
02:19:32.230 --> 02:19:35.510
we showed a Blendtec blender blending an iPhone.

2624
02:19:35.540 --> 02:19:38.120
We showed a video of that yesterday.
It's amazing.

2625
02:19:38.170 --> 02:19:40.790
And like what do you think would happen if that iPhone got in the bottom of a

2626
02:19:40.791 --> 02:19:43.550
glacier and it's a mile high and it's moving,
you know,

2627
02:19:43.551 --> 02:19:45.320
a foot a year or whatever the fuck it does.

2628
02:19:45.321 --> 02:19:48.050
Just crossing everything in front of it.

2629
02:19:48.380 --> 02:19:52.560
Trillions of tons of ice.
You wouldn't get much more than that either.

2630
02:19:52.561 --> 02:19:54.820
It would just crush it down to nothing.
You mentioned though,

2631
02:19:55.020 --> 02:20:00.020
<v 1>you mentioned this war between like ignorance or stupidity and technology and</v>

2632
02:20:01.030 --> 02:20:03.870
that's the battle that it,
it's,
it's,
it is a huge battle,

2633
02:20:04.080 --> 02:20:08.220
but what concerns me and I'm,
I am fundamentally an optimist,
but I always,

2634
02:20:08.280 --> 02:20:13.260
I always raise a flag when I can and what concerns me is technology's role in

2635
02:20:13.261 --> 02:20:16.590
dming people down that its role,
its role as a propaganda machine.

2636
02:20:16.591 --> 02:20:18.180
Astroturfing you know,

2637
02:20:18.181 --> 02:20:21.900
where you can make it look like the opinions of many are something just with a

2638
02:20:21.901 --> 02:20:22.591
click of a mouse.

2639
02:20:22.591 --> 02:20:25.470
There are companies that are designed to do this where you can disseminate

2640
02:20:25.471 --> 02:20:27.420
information.
People can live in their bumble,
bumble,

2641
02:20:27.421 --> 02:20:31.710
where if if let's say a Republican Google something or a Democrat googles

2642
02:20:31.711 --> 02:20:31.981
something,

2643
02:20:31.981 --> 02:20:35.730
their results are filtered and different from each other like this is happening

2644
02:20:35.731 --> 02:20:36.564
today.

2645
02:20:36.630 --> 02:20:41.580
<v 0>I see that,
but I also,
and I agree with you that that is a concern,</v>

2646
02:20:41.730 --> 02:20:44.970
but I also see that the free distribution of information,

2647
02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:50.000
ultimately we'll balance that out because I see that what's going on now is more

2648
02:20:50.131 --> 02:20:53.310
skepticism,
more intolerance to corruption,

2649
02:20:53.311 --> 02:20:56.760
more understanding of the corruption itself than it's ever existed before.

2650
02:20:56.970 --> 02:20:58.810
And that is because of the Internet.
Right.

2651
02:20:59.010 --> 02:21:02.310
But have you read Youtube comments like that?
I know I've been,

2652
02:21:02.311 --> 02:21:06.360
I mean as much as it,
that's a joke,
like that skepticism is being fueled,

2653
02:21:06.400 --> 02:21:10.300
<v 1>empowered and growing exponentially on both sides of every issue.</v>

2654
02:21:11.110 --> 02:21:11.651
You know what I mean?

2655
02:21:11.651 --> 02:21:14.890
Like the commentary and the dissection and the editing of information,

2656
02:21:15.040 --> 02:21:18.220
which is prevalent now.
People,

2657
02:21:18.310 --> 02:21:20.070
people seek out voices that,

2658
02:21:20.071 --> 02:21:22.030
that that's been raised thinking that they want to have.
Yeah,

2659
02:21:22.090 --> 02:21:26.050
<v 0>that is true for now,
but I think people are better today at,</v>

2660
02:21:26.170 --> 02:21:30.880
I know I am certainly better today at seeing contrary points to seeing

2661
02:21:30.881 --> 02:21:33.520
information that doesn't jive with me as you seek them out though.

2662
02:21:33.710 --> 02:21:34.720
It's because I seek them out.

2663
02:21:34.721 --> 02:21:36.970
But I think that's a trend that we could set and all sorts of people.

2664
02:21:37.410 --> 02:21:41.230
I think the only way to really truly benefit is to actually truly benefit and

2665
02:21:41.231 --> 02:21:45.970
the only way to truly benefit is to to be honest and real and to know what is

2666
02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:46.720
going on.

2667
02:21:46.720 --> 02:21:49.810
Not to have a distorted perception of what's going on because you can only live

2668
02:21:49.811 --> 02:21:52.750
in that distortion for so long before you go fucking insane.

2669
02:21:52.900 --> 02:21:54.820
And even people that are insane wish they weren't.

2670
02:21:54.821 --> 02:21:59.440
And I think there is a way that we can all figure out how to get through this

2671
02:21:59.441 --> 02:22:04.330
and not be insane.
And the only way is truth,
reality at an objective thinking.

2672
02:22:04.570 --> 02:22:08.350
I think the internet facilitates that in a way that nothing else beforehand.

2673
02:22:08.351 --> 02:22:11.710
I think the Internet getting,
it's only been here for a couple of decades,

2674
02:22:12.070 --> 02:22:17.070
I think it hasn't even had a chance to set trends in the future generations of

2675
02:22:17.141 --> 02:22:18.760
humanity,
which I think are inevitable.

2676
02:22:18.880 --> 02:22:21.460
I think what we're dealing with is the adolescents of the Internet,

2677
02:22:21.490 --> 02:22:26.160
the adolescence of why I always refer to today as the roaring the digital era.

2678
02:22:26.270 --> 02:22:29.190
<v 2>Right?
And then eventually we're going to figure this out and get it locked down.</v>

2679
02:22:29.191 --> 02:22:32.400
But it's going to define a huge human beings are,

2680
02:22:32.550 --> 02:22:35.010
it's going to define them in a way that didn't before.

2681
02:22:35.011 --> 02:22:38.250
The access to information from the time they were a young child and the ability

2682
02:22:38.251 --> 02:22:40.960
to disseminate information and you know,
and,
and,

2683
02:22:41.310 --> 02:22:42.840
and double and triple check things.

2684
02:22:42.841 --> 02:22:46.530
And there's people like Wiki leaks and there's people like anonymous that are on

2685
02:22:46.531 --> 02:22:50.250
top of shit to make sure that everybody knows the truth and I think that will

2686
02:22:50.251 --> 02:22:53.070
spawn others.
And I think that is the trend of the future.

2687
02:22:53.071 --> 02:22:55.080
The trend of the future is the truth.

2688
02:22:55.110 --> 02:22:59.640
And I think that's all being distributed through the Internet and imaging

2689
02:22:59.880 --> 02:23:03.980
changing generation.
Again,
as a,
as,
as a fundamental optimist and a,

2690
02:23:03.981 --> 02:23:08.160
an advocate for technology.
I agree and I hope,
but with that said,

2691
02:23:08.161 --> 02:23:09.110
just as a,

2692
02:23:09.220 --> 02:23:12.390
the Internet's ability to distribute information and disseminate truth,

2693
02:23:12.690 --> 02:23:17.190
it's also in its infancy to distort and to deliver messages to people that are

2694
02:23:17.191 --> 02:23:18.560
targeted and false.
Sure.

2695
02:23:18.670 --> 02:23:23.010
But that requires conspiracy and the conspiracy doesn't necessarily think about

2696
02:23:23.011 --> 02:23:27.030
conspiracy is conspiracy doesn't necessarily empower the individual and the

2697
02:23:27.031 --> 02:23:30.730
individual is the one who's going to break the conspiracy much like wikileaks,

2698
02:23:30.750 --> 02:23:32.640
much like that Bradley Manning Guy did that,

2699
02:23:32.880 --> 02:23:37.200
people are going to realize that that does not benefit them too to help this big

2700
02:23:37.201 --> 02:23:39.090
giant group of clients,
you know,

2701
02:23:39.091 --> 02:23:42.330
and I think that as a trend or that giant group of cons,

2702
02:23:42.331 --> 02:23:45.660
we'll use astroturfing and the technology available to deliver a specific

2703
02:23:45.661 --> 02:23:48.210
message to them on the channels that they're getting it to that either a,

2704
02:23:48.211 --> 02:23:51.120
they believe it's truth or they feel like they need to believe it for their

2705
02:23:51.121 --> 02:23:53.820
security or for a myriad reasons.
Maybe again,

2706
02:23:53.850 --> 02:23:56.610
my argument is that it's going to be harder and harder to do that.

2707
02:23:56.700 --> 02:24:00.580
I'm just saying we need to be vigilant.
Ever vigilant.
Yes,
I agree with you.

2708
02:24:00.580 --> 02:24:04.920
That's why I'm starting a podcast.
Fuck death squad.
Fun next week.

2709
02:24:04.921 --> 02:24:08.490
Kevin Pereira stepped up to the plate kid.
Yeah.

2710
02:24:08.491 --> 02:24:10.190
I don't like going to talk about fisting and cake farts.

2711
02:24:10.230 --> 02:24:11.790
That's all you need to talk about.
It's all it really.

2712
02:24:11.850 --> 02:24:14.430
Everything else is redundant.
Parts is still one of my favorite videos.

2713
02:24:14.490 --> 02:24:18.000
It's about fun,
Ladies and gentlemen.
That's what this life is.
It's,

2714
02:24:18.001 --> 02:24:20.940
I mean you want to break it down too.
Hippy positive energy.

2715
02:24:21.120 --> 02:24:23.520
You want to break it down to that.
That is one way to look at it.

2716
02:24:23.521 --> 02:24:27.060
Although it's sort of an idea has been painted by yoga instructors trying to

2717
02:24:27.061 --> 02:24:27.930
fuck their students.

2718
02:24:28.520 --> 02:24:33.450
There's more to it and by you know cocacola saying that that coke will deliver a

2719
02:24:33.451 --> 02:24:37.590
smile if you want fun by our product as possible that some products do deliver

2720
02:24:37.591 --> 02:24:41.100
fun though,
right?
I do.
Have you tried oxycontin?
What about you're a seven.

2721
02:24:41.340 --> 02:24:43.830
Oh my God,
so much fun.
It's a Audi we're talking about.

2722
02:24:44.260 --> 02:24:48.630
If you look at what does the space ship on wheels heaven.
It is a spaceship.
Yeah.

2723
02:24:48.631 --> 02:24:51.630
Rich guys talking about cars.
That's what the folks need in this world.

2724
02:24:51.780 --> 02:24:56.610
That's real change.
Aspirational programming.
How dare you?
I'm sad.

2725
02:24:56.640 --> 02:25:00.810
I'm sad that it's just Obama and I thought when Obama came into office that we

2726
02:25:00.811 --> 02:25:01.890
were going to have like a real,

2727
02:25:01.920 --> 02:25:05.070
wasn't there a moment where you really thought like,
Holy Shit.
I thought too,

2728
02:25:05.071 --> 02:25:07.350
and it wasn't because I believe the campaign,

2729
02:25:07.380 --> 02:25:11.400
I really believe that we would see change because his first campaign was funded

2730
02:25:11.490 --> 02:25:14.400
by the people and you know,
again,

2731
02:25:14.730 --> 02:25:19.020
money and politics is the root of so many evils.
Lobbyists,
super packs,

2732
02:25:19.050 --> 02:25:21.120
all that shit.
It's the root of so many evils that I thought like,

2733
02:25:21.140 --> 02:25:25.420
here is a guy who's going to be beholden to us because we put them there.

2734
02:25:25.420 --> 02:25:30.190
I personally donated,
he's a young guy.
He's comes from a single mom.

2735
02:25:30.191 --> 02:25:32.850
He's half black.
He's been to the an elitist.

2736
02:25:32.851 --> 02:25:36.100
It's not some blue blood count and went to school in Connecticut,
right?
Yeah.

2737
02:25:36.101 --> 02:25:37.780
I thought this is,
this is our chance.

2738
02:25:37.781 --> 02:25:41.830
I thought this was really going to be a check and the push Cheney administration

2739
02:25:41.831 --> 02:25:45.820
was clearly evil.
I mean you could be a Republican all day,
Ladies and gentlemen,

2740
02:25:45.821 --> 02:25:49.060
if you are a fan of civil liberties,

2741
02:25:49.061 --> 02:25:53.860
if you are a fan of,
uh,
of people looking out for people,

2742
02:25:54.040 --> 02:25:58.360
have the fuck,
could you be a fan of fiscal side,
fiscal conservatism?

2743
02:25:58.390 --> 02:26:02.260
Like they blew up the budget.
They went unframed wars and everything else.

2744
02:26:02.261 --> 02:26:04.990
So pretty insane.
And that was pretty telling that they've,

2745
02:26:04.991 --> 02:26:07.450
none of them were at the RNC and the single one of them,

2746
02:26:07.451 --> 02:26:10.090
not a single one of them.
Yeah.
Erase those memories.
That hilarious.

2747
02:26:10.120 --> 02:26:12.370
You would think that the last sitting president,

2748
02:26:12.430 --> 02:26:15.150
the last Sydney president to term press a whole cabinet,

2749
02:26:15.160 --> 02:26:16.420
he's someone that they would bring out.

2750
02:26:16.430 --> 02:26:20.740
Now they're avoiding any mention of George W he might be insane by now.

2751
02:26:20.741 --> 02:26:23.230
Who knows?
When was the last time you saw him get interviewed?
He might be out.

2752
02:26:23.231 --> 02:26:25.930
He's on a ranch right now.
He's doing fine.
I think he's got to be,

2753
02:26:26.140 --> 02:26:29.620
there's gotta be some disconnect in order for you to be a guy who's responsible

2754
02:26:29.621 --> 02:26:32.440
for the death of hundreds of thousands,
if not millions of people.

2755
02:26:32.560 --> 02:26:34.360
There's gotta be some sort of a disconnect.

2756
02:26:34.540 --> 02:26:37.750
And ultimately I think that's probably what fuck Ronald Reagan's head over.

2757
02:26:37.960 --> 02:26:39.970
I think that it fucks up a lot of people.

2758
02:26:39.971 --> 02:26:44.740
That's look Johnnie Cochran and Robert Kadash in both those guys died young of

2759
02:26:44.741 --> 02:26:49.160
like brain tumors.
Okay.
Why?
Cause they got Oj Simpson off.
They know.

2760
02:26:49.190 --> 02:26:52.870
They know.
They know they did something,
some evil shit they had.

2761
02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:56.410
I mean you get brain tumors,
two guys get brain tumors.
They die of,

2762
02:26:56.710 --> 02:26:59.220
I think they both got brain tumors.
Is that the case?

2763
02:26:59.970 --> 02:27:02.800
But I have proven it in a quarter.
Both young.
They both died young.

2764
02:27:02.830 --> 02:27:07.270
I mean that's your,
your,
your health pays a fucking price for that shit.
I'm not,

2765
02:27:07.271 --> 02:27:09.150
I'm not saying that that's the reason why he's on that.

2766
02:27:09.160 --> 02:27:12.310
Like where people have to lie during a study or do something that they believe

2767
02:27:12.311 --> 02:27:15.100
is morally wrong and then they test their physical health to see if that

2768
02:27:15.101 --> 02:27:17.610
knowledge,
if those secrets weighs on them.
Cause it must,

2769
02:27:17.620 --> 02:27:21.010
I'm sure it has to have a load bear on your soul to it's,

2770
02:27:21.011 --> 02:27:22.330
it fucks people over man.

2771
02:27:22.331 --> 02:27:25.780
You've seen people's faces when they've gone through scandal and they're dealing

2772
02:27:25.781 --> 02:27:29.350
with negative and negative energy becomes real.
Talk to Jamie Kilstein,
I want to,

2773
02:27:29.351 --> 02:27:32.110
negative energy will fucking come down on you for real.

2774
02:27:32.140 --> 02:27:34.510
Has there been a study on memory call,

2775
02:27:34.530 --> 02:27:39.530
a memory recall and memory call of those who are documenting and experience

2776
02:27:39.671 --> 02:27:42.760
versus those who are actively participating in it?
Like for example,

2777
02:27:42.761 --> 02:27:47.260
if I'm at a concert or if I'm at any event and I'm too busy taking photos for

2778
02:27:47.261 --> 02:27:50.110
Instagram and tweeting about it and snapping photos and whatever,
yes,

2779
02:27:50.170 --> 02:27:52.840
I can look at those memories and I have recall of those memories,

2780
02:27:52.870 --> 02:27:57.580
but how active is my memory of that event and you know how on what scale would I

2781
02:27:57.581 --> 02:28:01.030
rate that experience versus being present and enjoying it?
Extremely subjective.

2782
02:28:01.031 --> 02:28:03.850
Depends on the individual,
depends on how they viewed the past,

2783
02:28:03.851 --> 02:28:07.540
whether or not they've had traumatic experiences at any sort of event before,

2784
02:28:07.541 --> 02:28:11.020
whether they've had a reason to look at things in great detail.

2785
02:28:11.200 --> 02:28:16.200
They've also shown that people can experience things and then if there's a

2786
02:28:16.390 --> 02:28:20.020
certain amount of time where someone introduces something that didn't actually

2787
02:28:20.021 --> 02:28:22.700
happen in your,
and then revisits

2788
02:28:22.700 --> 02:28:26.330
<v 0>it with the same information later that these people will agree that something</v>

2789
02:28:26.331 --> 02:28:27.530
happened that didn't happen.

2790
02:28:27.770 --> 02:28:32.770
So they'll intentionally inject expecially during emotionally charged events.

2791
02:28:33.140 --> 02:28:38.120
They'll intentionally inject some sort of a fake memory into someone's mind and

2792
02:28:38.121 --> 02:28:41.360
later that becomes real.
And that's what people have argued about Oj,

2793
02:28:41.361 --> 02:28:44.570
that Oj actually does believe that he didn't kill them after a while,

2794
02:28:44.571 --> 02:28:48.750
that like you might even be able to fucking pass a polygraph test after a

2795
02:28:48.751 --> 02:28:49.240
certain,

2796
02:28:49.240 --> 02:28:52.690
<v 1>oh,
you can absolutely introduce false memories by asking leading questions.</v>

2797
02:28:52.860 --> 02:28:55.930
You've got the guy in the white hat,
what guy?
I know the guy in the white hat.
Oh,

2798
02:28:55.931 --> 02:28:58.360
of course there was a guy in a white hat there because now you're asking,

2799
02:28:58.450 --> 02:29:02.200
<v 0>well,
you know that whole story about those people that were wrongly convicted of</v>

2800
02:29:02.440 --> 02:29:03.430
child molestation,

2801
02:29:03.431 --> 02:29:07.660
they were running a daycare center and they had talked all these kids into

2802
02:29:07.810 --> 02:29:12.430
coming up with stories of someone touching them and it was all full.
False.

2803
02:29:12.431 --> 02:29:16.660
It was all bullshit,
but they had introduced it into a child's brain.

2804
02:29:16.661 --> 02:29:21.661
And like there's one thing to talk about memories and how tricky that can be

2805
02:29:21.850 --> 02:29:25.870
because on one hand there are memories in my life that I have that I can tell

2806
02:29:25.871 --> 02:29:30.430
you with absolutely no uncertainty whatsoever that I remember exactly what

2807
02:29:30.431 --> 02:29:34.170
happened.
But there's some that I'm like,
man,
it's like,
uh,
uh,

2808
02:29:34.240 --> 02:29:37.330
like flash show in my head.
It's like a snapshot show.

2809
02:29:37.331 --> 02:29:40.570
I see like a slide here,
a slide.
And if I can

2810
02:29:40.800 --> 02:29:42.000
<v 1>interpolate that for you and say,</v>

2811
02:29:42.001 --> 02:29:44.340
well then between slide eight and slide be this event happened,

2812
02:29:44.341 --> 02:29:47.070
you might actually connect those dots and go,
well I guess your event did happen.

2813
02:29:47.071 --> 02:29:48.690
Cause I could see that being part of it

2814
02:29:49.050 --> 02:29:53.240
<v 0>sort of end things get recalibrated to like I remember I had a particular image</v>

2815
02:29:53.241 --> 02:29:56.750
of the house where I grew up in and then I went back and saw it recently and I

2816
02:29:56.751 --> 02:30:00.640
was like,
Oh yeah,
okay.
It was over here now.
Oh it was this way,
you know,

2817
02:30:00.641 --> 02:30:04.130
it was like I had to recalibrate and now I have the revised version.

2818
02:30:04.370 --> 02:30:07.310
I have all the,
I have everything put into place,

2819
02:30:07.311 --> 02:30:09.800
but if you had made me like draw my street before,

2820
02:30:09.801 --> 02:30:12.020
I might have fucked it up entirely.
You know,

2821
02:30:12.050 --> 02:30:15.600
I might've had different people's houses and the wrong sides and we're,

2822
02:30:15.710 --> 02:30:18.350
well the bridge is over to the left.
Fuck,
I thought it was over here.
You know,

2823
02:30:18.351 --> 02:30:19.010
you can,

2824
02:30:19.010 --> 02:30:23.510
you can twist shit up and make it real inside your stupid head.

2825
02:30:23.960 --> 02:30:25.340
You know?
And maybe that's,

2826
02:30:25.420 --> 02:30:28.700
that's one of the benefits of the upgrade when we're going to be able to video

2827
02:30:28.701 --> 02:30:31.230
record everything 24 seven yeah.
And people,

2828
02:30:31.250 --> 02:30:32.810
it's going to start out with Google goggles,

2829
02:30:32.811 --> 02:30:34.850
then work its way to a chip that you put in your eyeballs.

2830
02:30:35.270 --> 02:30:37.820
<v 1>It'd be contact lens with led and then you won't even need that.</v>

2831
02:30:38.130 --> 02:30:41.670
<v 0>Who's going to be the first person that lets their eyes get cut out for some new</v>

2832
02:30:41.730 --> 02:30:44.820
eyeballs that we've invented that are way better that's going to happen.

2833
02:30:44.860 --> 02:30:45.700
<v 1>Reading a book about that.</v>

2834
02:30:45.701 --> 02:30:49.000
Right now it's a fictional tale about a guy who loses his leg in a traumatic

2835
02:30:49.001 --> 02:30:52.450
accident,
but he's an engineer working at this future kind of biotech company.

2836
02:30:52.570 --> 02:30:56.560
So we designed a better leg and it gets addicted to the fact that his bionic leg

2837
02:30:56.561 --> 02:31:00.040
has better features and can do certain things that his real lay can't.

2838
02:31:00.080 --> 02:31:03.610
Sweet cuts off his real leg.
The other ones so we can have to bionic legs,

2839
02:31:03.611 --> 02:31:06.190
but then he's like,
well,
if my legs are better,
why don't I cut off my arm?

2840
02:31:06.220 --> 02:31:09.550
Oh my God.
It's like,
it's fucking awesome,
Jesus.

2841
02:31:09.560 --> 02:31:12.560
<v 0>And you would think the $6 million man would not be happy with just a good right</v>

2842
02:31:12.561 --> 02:31:13.400
hand.
You know,

2843
02:31:13.401 --> 02:31:17.480
he throws a Shitty Jab and we'll hire it comes the right hand of doom that could

2844
02:31:17.481 --> 02:31:20.130
punch right through your head.
There's a great of people throwing baseballs

2845
02:31:20.130 --> 02:31:23.170
<v 1>with their non dominant hands.
I don't know if you've seen it.
It's hilarious.</v>

2846
02:31:23.171 --> 02:31:23.921
Like the,
the,
the,

2847
02:31:23.921 --> 02:31:27.330
the weakling little throw in the awkward motion that if you try to do anything

2848
02:31:27.331 --> 02:31:28.500
with your nondominant hand,

2849
02:31:28.830 --> 02:31:30.450
if I had a bionic arm talking about this the other day,

2850
02:31:30.451 --> 02:31:33.630
do you guys think you can masturbate using your nondominant hand like I,

2851
02:31:33.750 --> 02:31:38.370
<v 2>it absolutely that masturbation is just this,</v>

2852
02:31:38.371 --> 02:31:43.110
it's not a lot of works.
Weird playing pool lefthanded is really fucking hard.

2853
02:31:43.111 --> 02:31:46.100
I play really good rice chicken off of the cue stick though.
That's all you,

2854
02:31:46.120 --> 02:31:50.310
that's,
you were just doing a euro grip.
Yeah,
but it's not,
it's how you,
you,

2855
02:31:50.500 --> 02:31:54.460
you judge the plane of your,
your arm.
Like how it's,

2856
02:31:54.780 --> 02:31:55.620
it has to be,

2857
02:31:55.621 --> 02:31:59.340
you have to be in control of the speed of the motion and there's a lot of fine

2858
02:31:59.341 --> 02:32:04.080
motor skill movements going on.
There is nothing compared to drawing.
I can,

2859
02:32:04.140 --> 02:32:07.380
I can shoot pool,
I can make certain shots with my left hand.

2860
02:32:07.410 --> 02:32:10.800
I can't draw with my left hand at can you write like you're going to get fucking

2861
02:32:10.860 --> 02:32:12.510
barely my,
it's doesn't listen.

2862
02:32:12.750 --> 02:32:17.340
<v 1>Every guy is ambidextrous when it comes to jerking off.
Yes.
Come on.
It's every,</v>

2863
02:32:17.370 --> 02:32:20.640
every guy can switch it.
I can't what?
Yeah,
that's what I'm saying.

2864
02:32:20.641 --> 02:32:24.180
Like if there was nothing in front of me like,
and I had my,

2865
02:32:24.181 --> 02:32:27.960
my imagination with my right hand,
I could,
you know,
do it on my left hand.

2866
02:32:27.961 --> 02:32:30.720
I think from scratch with nothing in front of me.
I don't think I can even get it

2867
02:32:30.770 --> 02:32:33.710
<v 2>balanced place.
I disagree.
I know you could do it.</v>

2868
02:32:33.711 --> 02:32:36.800
You would just have to be horny enough.
See,
when you say from scratch,

2869
02:32:36.920 --> 02:32:38.720
you're talking about your regular life,

2870
02:32:38.721 --> 02:32:43.390
which you beat off like a fucking spider monkey every three or four hours and

2871
02:32:43.440 --> 02:32:47.510
that twice.
You need a highly tuned jerk off him for that kind of beating up.

2872
02:32:47.870 --> 02:32:52.070
You're a guy who watches porn all the time.
You Bang Porn Stars.
You know,

2873
02:32:52.071 --> 02:32:55.790
you've got a lot of ridiculousness going on and your situation that doesn't,

2874
02:32:55.791 --> 02:32:59.480
you know.
But if you were like a guy who couldn't ever get laid and you couldn't,

2875
02:32:59.481 --> 02:33:02.810
you didn't have access to porn and you weren't jerking off no flashlights and

2876
02:33:02.811 --> 02:33:06.740
you went without beating off for like two weeks.
And then someone said,
here,

2877
02:33:06.830 --> 02:33:10.040
here's a porno film beat off with your left hand.
He'd be like,
fuck

2878
02:33:11.780 --> 02:33:12.680
you had Peter North.

2879
02:33:12.700 --> 02:33:16.060
<v 1>It's all over your screen.
It just seems like it's,
it seems like it's just,</v>

2880
02:33:16.120 --> 02:33:20.500
it seems like it's really like a dead.

2881
02:33:20.530 --> 02:33:22.630
Like it doesn't feel like it has any feeling.

2882
02:33:22.660 --> 02:33:27.190
You got to build calluses on an on a new guitar player.
You've got to fill it up.

2883
02:33:27.230 --> 02:33:28.880
<v 2>It's like my joke that I had like way,
way,</v>

2884
02:33:28.881 --> 02:33:31.580
way back in the day about having a girl jerk you off though but having a girl

2885
02:33:31.581 --> 02:33:34.310
jerked you off to like trying to brush your teeth with your left hand.

2886
02:33:34.610 --> 02:33:38.960
It's like just clumsy spastic and that your right hand and years a mother

2887
02:33:38.961 --> 02:33:39.621
Fucker,

2888
02:33:39.621 --> 02:33:44.120
you're right hand knows where the gum line is and it gets that fast vibration

2889
02:33:44.121 --> 02:33:47.810
but your left hand is like you have to like hold it still and move your face

2890
02:33:47.811 --> 02:33:50.330
over to the brush because your hand is so stupid.
It doesn't,

2891
02:33:50.910 --> 02:33:54.930
it doesn't have a brush.
I baby bird with two Sonicares every night animals.

2892
02:33:54.960 --> 02:33:55.281
You know what?

2893
02:33:55.281 --> 02:33:58.820
I did want to make sure I can double fist the by put a qtip in each ear and I

2894
02:33:58.821 --> 02:34:02.090
took a shit at the same time and then that blacked out from ecstasy.

2895
02:34:02.750 --> 02:34:04.840
It's the most amazing feeling.
Cleared all your orders.

2896
02:34:06.830 --> 02:34:08.570
There's this wonderful feeling,
isn't it?
There's a

2897
02:34:08.570 --> 02:34:12.450
<v 1>new toilet add on that they're selling the squatty and it's like,
uh,
it's,
uh,</v>

2898
02:34:12.500 --> 02:34:15.770
it's supposed to be like a thing that it stores and on it,
no,
you sit,

2899
02:34:15.771 --> 02:34:19.330
but it elevates your legs so that you have more of a squatting posture,

2900
02:34:19.331 --> 02:34:23.050
which like relaxes the,
the tracks of the,
the shit can slide out easier.

2901
02:34:23.260 --> 02:34:25.450
And it's been scientifically proven that squatting,
I mean,

2902
02:34:25.451 --> 02:34:29.220
we've done it for years and years and years as a society until we have bowls to

2903
02:34:29.230 --> 02:34:31.990
sit down on that.
It's,
it's more efficient.
It's healthier for you.

2904
02:34:32.140 --> 02:34:35.860
There's another is Adam.
Yeah,
just look at many places,
but I don't think that's,

2905
02:34:35.861 --> 02:34:39.340
I wonder if that's going to catch on people shitting part about people are so

2906
02:34:39.341 --> 02:34:43.390
weird about fecal matter and biological movements in general.

2907
02:34:43.420 --> 02:34:46.140
<v 0>Well when Brian and I were in Japan,
one of the things that we buy,</v>

2908
02:34:46.160 --> 02:34:51.070
waste toilet guys sent me these toilets best and I got to thank this company

2909
02:34:51.071 --> 02:34:54.610
that sent me the toilet because I don't have the information.
Yeah,

2910
02:34:54.611 --> 02:34:56.200
they sent me two of them.
I haven't set them up.

2911
02:34:56.230 --> 02:34:59.470
<v 1>Yeah,
I think the ones with the heating massaging and the ass jet.</v>

2912
02:34:59.550 --> 02:35:00.630
<v 0>Yes.
The whole deal.</v>

2913
02:35:00.631 --> 02:35:05.610
And they will be such a joy will be at the new studio.
So Brian,

2914
02:35:05.611 --> 02:35:09.510
when you take a shit at the new studio and you will be able to clean,

2915
02:35:10.530 --> 02:35:12.840
they are,
they're called.
They're,
it's,

2916
02:35:12.841 --> 02:35:16.290
it's from the company's called Braun del and um,

2917
02:35:16.320 --> 02:35:20.250
it's B r o n d e l l.com.

2918
02:35:20.550 --> 02:35:23.780
And Bron Dell has a,
they sent us to have these in there.

2919
02:35:23.840 --> 02:35:26.190
They're fucking Cadillacs for your ass cheeks.

2920
02:35:26.430 --> 02:35:28.520
Everybody want to be shitting with them.
One in my,

2921
02:35:28.540 --> 02:35:32.520
my Home Office and one in the studio and it will be dope as fuck.

2922
02:35:32.550 --> 02:35:36.440
You sent a new studio.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I got a new studio in Woodland Hills.
Congrats.

2923
02:35:36.460 --> 02:35:39.780
Thanks.
It's all set up.
It's fucking Badass.
It's,
um,

2924
02:35:39.870 --> 02:35:43.020
the lace Lisa signed and now there's equipment being built.

2925
02:35:43.021 --> 02:35:48.021
Right now I'm hiring a astute Eric who created Brian's a cat clock over there.

2926
02:35:48.421 --> 02:35:51.510
The death squad clock.
Yeah.
He uh,
he's a metalworker.

2927
02:35:51.511 --> 02:35:55.770
He's building me this custom,
like this whole thing set up kind of,

2928
02:35:55.771 --> 02:35:58.380
and it's going to be cool because it's reclaimed wood.

2929
02:35:58.590 --> 02:36:02.670
We're using like reclaimed farm.
Oh yeah,
cycling.
Yeah.
Not only that,
it's,

2930
02:36:02.700 --> 02:36:07.110
I like the fact that it's got like some life to it.
Like it's old,
like this,

2931
02:36:07.111 --> 02:36:10.530
people been using this,
there's like vibes in it.
I,
you know,

2932
02:36:10.531 --> 02:36:15.531
I subscribe to a Rupert Sheldrake idea that even objects have of sorter.

2933
02:36:16.340 --> 02:36:18.530
<v 1>Yeah.
Residence and a member of energy has been pumped into them.</v>

2934
02:36:18.531 --> 02:36:20.580
That's what like the old recording studios,
we'd be like,
well,

2935
02:36:20.581 --> 02:36:22.820
these albums had been recorded there and I'm like,
that means something.

2936
02:36:23.930 --> 02:36:25.970
And that energy was,
was captured there.

2937
02:36:25.970 --> 02:36:28.880
<v 0>Dude,
I'm going to take you after this podcast is over into the main room of the</v>

2938
02:36:28.881 --> 02:36:30.920
comedy of the comedy room here at the Ice House.

2939
02:36:30.921 --> 02:36:33.560
And you tell me if you don't feel vibes in this place,

2940
02:36:33.830 --> 02:36:37.970
this place is fucking magic.
This,
the ice house is a perfect example of a,

2941
02:36:38.180 --> 02:36:40.670
like a vortex of like happiness.

2942
02:36:40.850 --> 02:36:43.700
There's so many people have laughed their fucking ass off in that room.

2943
02:36:44.010 --> 02:36:48.800
That room has a resonance.
You feel it.
Yeah.

2944
02:36:48.990 --> 02:36:51.210
<v 1>You know,
it was really bad ass,
by the way.
Speaking of the,
uh,</v>

2945
02:36:51.700 --> 02:36:55.480
Eddie Murphy and Chris Rock,
we're both at the comedy store last night.
Really

2946
02:36:57.700 --> 02:36:59.050
just walking in and like a,
you know,

2947
02:36:59.051 --> 02:37:02.650
it's just hanging on Tuesday or whatever and uh,
I'm just like,
Holy Shit.

2948
02:37:02.651 --> 02:37:05.590
That's Eddie Murphy.
Holy Shit.
That's crazy.
On stage.

2949
02:37:05.591 --> 02:37:06.930
Or they were just hanging out watching,

2950
02:37:07.310 --> 02:37:09.220
<v 0>speaking of which,
we got to get Charlie back in here,
man.</v>

2951
02:37:09.500 --> 02:37:12.120
We haven't had Charlie in here in a while.
I gotta I gotta contact them.

2952
02:37:12.121 --> 02:37:14.870
That was one of my favorite episodes when he's telling the story about Mike

2953
02:37:14.870 --> 02:37:17.740
Tyson,
they pull up the Mike Tyson towels or whatever.

2954
02:37:21.070 --> 02:37:24.170
Charlie Marvis nuzzling.
I'm greatest storytellers ever.

2955
02:37:24.890 --> 02:37:29.510
Last summer I was in Hawaii with my family on vacation and I ran it.

2956
02:37:29.511 --> 02:37:31.850
His cousin rich at the resort.
It's like,
what are you doing here?
It's like,

2957
02:37:31.851 --> 02:37:34.610
Charlie's here.
Ed is here,
and I hung out with Eddie.

2958
02:37:34.611 --> 02:37:36.800
I had lunch with Eddie Murphy and Charlie.
It was like,

2959
02:37:36.801 --> 02:37:41.510
this is the weirdest thing ever for being a kid in the to watching raw and then

2960
02:37:41.511 --> 02:37:44.240
all of sudden I'm talking to Eddie Murphy about comedy.
I was like,
Whoa,

2961
02:37:44.241 --> 02:37:45.710
this is bizarre man.

2962
02:37:46.190 --> 02:37:49.610
We're just sitting there talking to him like this is the strangest thing ever.

2963
02:37:50.030 --> 02:37:52.700
He was super nice man.
I've heard Eddie Murphy could be a dick.

2964
02:37:52.940 --> 02:37:57.090
He couldn't have been nicer man.
He was.
Maybe he was with his family.
I mean

2965
02:37:58.910 --> 02:38:01.220
that was one of those things where I was,
I was always talking.
I was like,

2966
02:38:01.250 --> 02:38:04.280
Holy Shit.
I'm talking about Eddie Murphy.
Right?
This is legit.

2967
02:38:04.340 --> 02:38:05.330
<v 3>When that moment happens,</v>

2968
02:38:05.331 --> 02:38:08.360
do you feel yourself like projecting out of your body and getting lost in your

2969
02:38:08.361 --> 02:38:11.300
own thoughts or do you keep it together pretty well and go,
Oh shit,
I'm talking,

2970
02:38:11.301 --> 02:38:14.230
but focus up.
This is a moment.
No,
I stay in the moment.
Yeah,

2971
02:38:14.640 --> 02:38:17.670
<v 0>there's a like a little voice.
I was like,
shut up bitch.</v>

2972
02:38:17.700 --> 02:38:22.180
It's a six year old kid in cowboy,
but Callaway Pajama onesy yeah,

2973
02:38:22.450 --> 02:38:26.160
the kid who listened to his first CD when he was on Saturday night live,

2974
02:38:26.190 --> 02:38:30.120
it was a cassette back then.
His best work in my opinion,
wasn't even delirious.

2975
02:38:30.121 --> 02:38:33.930
It was the album before delirious where he talks about putting an aftershave on

2976
02:38:33.931 --> 02:38:37.140
his dick and Washington's Paula's sick and his grandma came in.

2977
02:38:37.141 --> 02:38:40.710
You Lazy motherfucker washing you dick in the sink.

2978
02:38:40.880 --> 02:38:45.880
You too lazy to even take a bath wash your fucking funny man.

2979
02:38:46.231 --> 02:38:50.280
This it's,
there's a weird thing.
But like when I met Anthony Bordain it was just,

2980
02:38:50.360 --> 02:38:53.910
it seems silly,
but it was a weird thing.
I was like,
oh,
this is a fucking,

2981
02:38:53.911 --> 02:38:56.910
and I'm actually talking to Anthony Bordain.
This is strange.

2982
02:38:56.911 --> 02:38:58.230
Like he had no reservations about it.

2983
02:39:01.050 --> 02:39:03.780
When you like somebody and then you meet him,
it's real weird.
And when,

2984
02:39:03.781 --> 02:39:06.840
so when people meet me,
me and they get weirded out,
I'll go,
dude,
I've been there.

2985
02:39:06.841 --> 02:39:09.380
Don't worry about it.
Just get through it.
Write it out.
Right.

2986
02:39:11.250 --> 02:39:13.740
We're all just,
people just takes time.

2987
02:39:14.540 --> 02:39:18.980
<v 3>That said Kevin Smith for president.
That's why I'm voting in Kevin Smith.</v>

2988
02:39:19.070 --> 02:39:22.100
Kevin Smith for Pepsi running.
No,
I'm trying to think.
I'm going to vote a man.

2989
02:39:22.130 --> 02:39:25.160
He's a good guy.
It seems like you would run things fairly.
Sure is running.

2990
02:39:25.310 --> 02:39:29.470
He started out from scratch.
He's my,
my guy,
you know,
no one's no one's to,

2991
02:39:29.471 --> 02:39:33.020
everyone talks about a Gary Johnson and if people even mentioned me,

2992
02:39:33.230 --> 02:39:36.590
I think Kevin Smith,
I say he's a good dude.
It's put on for the president.

2993
02:39:36.591 --> 02:39:39.800
You want to be as vice president Kevin prayer vice president really venture out

2994
02:39:39.830 --> 02:39:43.500
was talking about running in 2016 and I think Howard stern is his running mate.

2995
02:39:44.270 --> 02:39:47.900
I think that's awesome.
Howard stern is,
is writing.
Yeah,
that'd be awesome.

2996
02:39:47.940 --> 02:39:48.411
But then sure.

2997
02:39:48.411 --> 02:39:53.150
It's like what his record of everything from entertainer to book rider to

2998
02:39:53.180 --> 02:39:55.010
government official to navy seal.

2999
02:39:55.070 --> 02:39:59.780
<v 0>What about tower shoveling?
Whenever bring up rose tower.</v>

3000
02:40:00.270 --> 02:40:02.660
Oh good.
I was a navy seal.

3001
02:40:02.920 --> 02:40:07.240
<v 3>I love it.
It's one step closer to President Camacho.
Um,</v>

3002
02:40:07.241 --> 02:40:12.241
I think that he has a good grasp on the amount of fuckery in this government.

3003
02:40:13.711 --> 02:40:15.530
But if you listened to way,
hey,

3004
02:40:15.570 --> 02:40:19.260
a debated with Jimmy Norton when you went on the opie and Anthony show him and

3005
02:40:19.261 --> 02:40:22.820
Jimmy Norton and you realize he's Shitty,
but he's kind of a flush shit.

3006
02:40:23.070 --> 02:40:27.140
He's got some fuckhead in him.
Don't think so.

3007
02:40:27.880 --> 02:40:30.120
This Brian?
No,
Brian did get them on mushrooms.

3008
02:40:30.480 --> 02:40:33.820
Was Your Bronco a full toilet or is it one of those lids?
The Lid.

3009
02:40:33.840 --> 02:40:35.580
It's just like the ones in Japan.

3010
02:40:35.760 --> 02:40:40.110
They take your regular lid off and they put this electric tronic ass cleaning by

3011
02:40:40.120 --> 02:40:43.170
Flam,
a jammy warm water up your butt thing.

3012
02:40:43.171 --> 02:40:45.900
It's amazing USB cable that gets in there and cleaned it all out and it's

3013
02:40:45.901 --> 02:40:47.190
something that makes you realize like,

3014
02:40:47.191 --> 02:40:52.080
why are we so gross with our smearing poop paper?
Because that's all it is.

3015
02:40:52.081 --> 02:40:55.770
We need the three seashells.
We all need to have our asses cleaned like that.

3016
02:40:55.771 --> 02:40:59.030
It would probably be like way healthy this and that's one of the things they're

3017
02:40:59.470 --> 02:41:04.050
Muslims.
Make Fun of.
Muslims make fun of it.
Yeah.
That's when you really love a,

3018
02:41:04.140 --> 02:41:05.250
when you shit in front of her.

3019
02:41:05.550 --> 02:41:07.680
I've seen guys shit in front of the girlfriends and I was like,

3020
02:41:07.681 --> 02:41:10.730
I have never been that comfortable with someone in a real relationship.

3021
02:41:10.750 --> 02:41:15.230
Do it on her chest and plastic wrap and just get it going.
I to say alone,

3022
02:41:17.010 --> 02:41:20.190
I think the rumors of Stallone,
even if they were true,

3023
02:41:20.280 --> 02:41:24.000
it's like I've seen it all.
You want to fucking shock me shit on my job.

3024
02:41:24.270 --> 02:41:28.470
You have to read the third when they're putting hotel room phones in a women's

3025
02:41:28.471 --> 02:41:31.800
assholes and trying to order room service by yelling into them.
No,

3026
02:41:32.430 --> 02:41:36.600
this is in the Rock,
the Motley Crue book.
It's a great book.

3027
02:41:37.410 --> 02:41:40.710
Not even a fan of Motley crew,
but the shift is a datable bone and a girl.

3028
02:41:40.850 --> 02:41:44.340
It's on audible.
It's absolutely worth listening to.
Whoa.
Yeah.

3029
02:41:44.400 --> 02:41:47.370
Imagine you're the next person,
that fucking hotel room and you go to,

3030
02:41:47.490 --> 02:41:50.850
I can't up dessert.
