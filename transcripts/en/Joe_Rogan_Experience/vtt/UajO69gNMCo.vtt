00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.460
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches and,</v>

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.440
<v Speaker 1>and I don't,</v>

3
00:00:04.441 --> 00:00:05.221
<v Speaker 1>and you're talking to a guy.</v>

4
00:00:05.221 --> 00:00:06.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't like Hillary at all.</v>

5
00:00:06.271 --> 00:00:07.104
<v Speaker 1>I think she's,</v>

6
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:08.520
<v Speaker 1>I think she's more of the same.</v>

7
00:00:08.521 --> 00:00:08.881
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

8
00:00:08.881 --> 00:00:10.410
<v Speaker 1>But I think she's a corrupt human being.</v>

9
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.700
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of examples of that.</v>

10
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:12.750
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

11
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:13.261
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

12
00:00:13.261 --> 00:00:15.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm not as uncharitable to say that I think she's,</v>

13
00:00:15.811 --> 00:00:16.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't think she's evil.</v>

14
00:00:16.891 --> 00:00:18.390
<v Speaker 1>I think she has a vision for the world.</v>

15
00:00:18.391 --> 00:00:19.201
<v Speaker 1>I think she wished she,</v>

16
00:00:19.201 --> 00:00:19.771
<v Speaker 1>in her mind,</v>

17
00:00:19.771 --> 00:00:22.170
<v Speaker 1>she believes she knows what's best for the country.</v>

18
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.860
<v Speaker 1>But there's a difference because I think she's willing to take big shortcuts to</v>

19
00:00:25.861 --> 00:00:29.480
<v Speaker 1>gain influence and always has an a career and a short colleague.</v>

20
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.050
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

21
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.261
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

22
00:00:30.261 --> 00:00:34.380
<v Speaker 1>we can have big influence using political influence to get what she wants when,</v>

23
00:00:34.381 --> 00:00:34.830
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

24
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:35.101
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

25
00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:38.280
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the people that Clinton pardoned,</v>

26
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:38.851
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

27
00:00:38.851 --> 00:00:41.430
<v Speaker 1>that part in scandal was the craziest thing in the world.</v>

28
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.641
<v Speaker 1>Did he?</v>

29
00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:42.210
<v Speaker 1>Pardon?</v>

30
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:42.661
<v Speaker 1>Frank?</v>

31
00:00:42.661 --> 00:00:43.170
<v Speaker 1>Rich.</v>

32
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.190
<v Speaker 1>We'll take a look at the list.</v>

33
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.001
<v Speaker 1>Frank.</v>

34
00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:45.360
<v Speaker 1>Rich,</v>

35
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

36
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:46.161
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

37
00:00:46.161 --> 00:00:51.161
<v Speaker 1>the Hee Hee Hillary wanted to run for Senate in New York and he needed certain</v>

38
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.510
<v Speaker 1>counties and he needed a large,</v>

39
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.051
<v Speaker 1>I believe,</v>

40
00:00:55.051 --> 00:00:56.940
<v Speaker 1>Hasidic Jewish vote vote.</v>

41
00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.390
<v Speaker 1>And he pardoned some guy in a rabbi or somebody in there that it was such a</v>

42
00:01:02.671 --> 00:01:03.070
<v Speaker 1>blur.</v>

43
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.640
<v Speaker 1>It's a little,</v>

44
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.490
<v Speaker 1>I remember the democratic somewhat,</v>

45
00:01:05.491 --> 00:01:07.620
<v Speaker 1>I think it was one of the democratic pundents who said,</v>

46
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how you defend this.</v>

47
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.520
<v Speaker 1>It's just so obvious that he's trying to buy his wife votes that he's trying to</v>

48
00:01:14.521 --> 00:01:15.181
<v Speaker 1>buy influence.</v>

49
00:01:15.181 --> 00:01:15.930
<v Speaker 1>And that was,</v>

50
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.220
<v Speaker 1>that's well documented.</v>

51
00:01:17.221 --> 00:01:19.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't think a lot of Democrats would disagree with that.</v>

52
00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.771
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

53
00:01:19.771 --> 00:01:20.460
<v Speaker 1>look it up.</v>

54
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.840
<v Speaker 1>Look up the uranium one.</v>

55
00:01:21.841 --> 00:01:23.640
<v Speaker 1>Deal one deal.</v>

56
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.800
<v Speaker 1>Who through Bill Clinton's influence,</v>

57
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.830
<v Speaker 1>this Canadian businessman bought the Kazakh oil,</v>

58
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.510
<v Speaker 1>a uranium fields.</v>

59
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

60
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.250
<v Speaker 1>let's go one scandal at a time.</v>

61
00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:33.243
<v Speaker 1>The first one,</v>

62
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.620
<v Speaker 1>did you find the first one?</v>

63
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

64
00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:36.581
<v Speaker 1>Is that the guy's name?</v>

65
00:01:36.581 --> 00:01:37.480
<v Speaker 1>Mark Pardons.</v>

66
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.540
<v Speaker 1>But look at this guy up before,</v>

67
00:01:39.541 --> 00:01:40.620
<v Speaker 1>I think he was going to go down.</v>

68
00:01:40.621 --> 00:01:41.280
<v Speaker 1>And it's like the,</v>

69
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.851
<v Speaker 1>at the time,</v>

70
00:01:41.851 --> 00:01:43.380
<v Speaker 1>largest tax evasion.</v>

71
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.561
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

72
00:01:43.561 --> 00:01:44.394
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

73
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.390
<v Speaker 1>Living in Switzerland,</v>

74
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.130
<v Speaker 1>prosecuting them.</v>

75
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.963
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

76
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.290
<v Speaker 1>Things right here in the middle.</v>

77
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.153
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

78
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.113
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

79
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.673
<v Speaker 1>Future.</v>

80
00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.940
<v Speaker 1>He was a fugitive who had fled the US doing this prosecution was residing in</v>

81
00:01:56.941 --> 00:01:57.600
<v Speaker 1>Switzerland.</v>

82
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.620
<v Speaker 1>He had $48 million in taxes and it was charged with 51 cadences.</v>

83
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.650
<v Speaker 1>Accounts of taxpayers was pardoned for tax evasion.</v>

84
00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.990
<v Speaker 1>He was required to pay a $1 million fine and waive any use of the pardon as a</v>

85
00:02:09.991 --> 00:02:13.050
<v Speaker 1>defense against any future civil charges that were filed against him in the</v>

86
00:02:13.051 --> 00:02:13.290
<v Speaker 1>same,</v>

87
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.130
<v Speaker 1>in the same case.</v>

88
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.760
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

89
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.100
<v Speaker 1>Critics complain that Denise Eisenberg,</v>

90
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.820
<v Speaker 1>rich,</v>

91
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:18.840
<v Speaker 1>his former wife,</v>

92
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.020
<v Speaker 1>had made substantial donations to the Clinton library and Mrs Clinton's Senate</v>

93
00:02:25.381 --> 00:02:26.190
<v Speaker 1>campaign.</v>

94
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.590
<v Speaker 1>What a surprise that Marc Rich,</v>

95
00:02:28.591 --> 00:02:31.200
<v Speaker 1>who lives in Switzerland and you're going to give them a part,</v>

96
00:02:31.201 --> 00:02:32.190
<v Speaker 1>and do you think they're connected?</v>

97
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.480
<v Speaker 1>It was so blatant.</v>

98
00:02:33.481 --> 00:02:34.470
<v Speaker 1>It was ridiculous.</v>

99
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.060
<v Speaker 1>But you can keep going with the pardon's.</v>

100
00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.590
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of examples of that.</v>

101
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.510
<v Speaker 1>So to call Hillary Clinton,</v>

102
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.390
<v Speaker 1>not corrupt the uranium one deal.</v>

103
00:02:42.391 --> 00:02:43.380
<v Speaker 1>Go ahead and look that up.</v>

104
00:02:43.381 --> 00:02:43.861
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>

105
00:02:43.861 --> 00:02:44.430
<v Speaker 1>What's Uranian?</v>

106
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.820
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>

107
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:45.211
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

108
00:02:45.211 --> 00:02:45.541
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

109
00:02:45.541 --> 00:02:46.020
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

110
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.081
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

111
00:02:46.081 --> 00:02:49.110
<v Speaker 1>Canadian businessman bought the Kazak in Kazakhstan,</v>

112
00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.960
<v Speaker 1>used to be a part of the Soviet Union,</v>

113
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.510
<v Speaker 1>a uranium fields.</v>

114
00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:55.190
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

115
00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.520
<v Speaker 1>some of them,</v>

116
00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.090
<v Speaker 1>some huge uranium fields.</v>

117
00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:58.740
<v Speaker 1>I think some of the biggest in the world.</v>

118
00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.960
<v Speaker 1>You're writing him.</v>

119
00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.970
<v Speaker 1>What do you use to make nuclear weapons?</v>

120
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.830
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

121
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.690
<v Speaker 1>And Bill Clinton,</v>

122
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.841
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

123
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:05.531
<v Speaker 1>help to his,</v>

124
00:03:05.531 --> 00:03:06.460
<v Speaker 1>it was his influence,</v>

125
00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.440
<v Speaker 1>a well documented influence help this Canadian businessman by those uranium</v>

126
00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:11.890
<v Speaker 1>fields.</v>

127
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:12.850
<v Speaker 1>But here's the problem.</v>

128
00:03:12.851 --> 00:03:17.590
<v Speaker 1>That Canadian businessman gave $31 million to the Clinton Foundation with a</v>

129
00:03:17.591 --> 00:03:22.591
<v Speaker 1>pledge for 100 million more and he gave Clinton a $500,000 check for speaking</v>

130
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.170
<v Speaker 1>for a speech and then 500,000 sounds.</v>

131
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:33.070
<v Speaker 1>Then when it came time for the Clinton</v>

132
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.390
<v Speaker 2>dinosaur bones sell for a lot of money at auctions.</v>

133
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.040
<v Speaker 2>It is a profitable business.</v>

134
00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.980
<v Speaker 2>There is pressure for academics to publish papers.</v>

135
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.970
<v Speaker 2>Museums are in the business of producing displays that are popular and</v>

136
00:03:44.971 --> 00:03:45.420
<v Speaker 2>appealing.</v>

137
00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.260
<v Speaker 2>What the nonprofit is a business need to produce material to sell,</v>

138
00:03:49.261 --> 00:03:50.370
<v Speaker 2>to stay in business.</v>

139
00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.410
<v Speaker 2>The mainstream media loves to hype alleged dinosaur fines much just to be gained</v>

140
00:03:55.411 --> 00:04:00.411
<v Speaker 2>by converting a bland non dinosaur discovery of a bone of modern origin into an</v>

141
00:04:00.961 --> 00:04:02.160
<v Speaker 2>impressive dinosaur.</v>

142
00:04:02.161 --> 00:04:06.540
<v Speaker 2>Find and letting artists interpretations and imaginations take the spotlight.</v>

143
00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.941
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

144
00:04:06.941 --> 00:04:08.340
<v Speaker 2>Other than the basic boring,</v>

145
00:04:08.341 --> 00:04:09.174
<v Speaker 2>real fine.</v>

146
00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.880
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

147
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:10.100
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

148
00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:11.280

<v Speaker 2>You can aggressive.</v>

215
00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:03.680
<v Speaker 2>I remember when you were like,</v>

216
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:04.491
<v Speaker 2>when I realized,</v>

217
00:06:04.491 --> 00:06:06.890
<v Speaker 2>cause I don't know at the time I didn't know anything about fighting,</v>

218
00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.160
<v Speaker 2>but then you were explaining how like their,</v>

219
00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:13.100
<v Speaker 2>they have these insanely deep combos.</v>

220
00:06:13.101 --> 00:06:14.270
<v Speaker 2>If this person does this,</v>

221
00:06:14.271 --> 00:06:19.271
<v Speaker 2>they have all these moves like 19 moves deep that like there's incredible.</v>

222
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.600
<v Speaker 2>So I think she's like that.</v>

223
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:22.370
<v Speaker 2>Like she has like if he does this,</v>

224
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:23.270
<v Speaker 2>you do this.</v>

225
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:24.350
<v Speaker 2>And if he does that and this,</v>

226
00:06:24.351 --> 00:06:24.621
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

227
00:06:24.621 --> 00:06:24.831
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

228
00:06:24.831 --> 00:06:25.281
<v Speaker 2>and then that.</v>

229
00:06:25.281 --> 00:06:25.731
<v Speaker 2>And then that,</v>

230
00:06:25.731 --> 00:06:26.450
<v Speaker 2>and then that.</v>

231
00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:30.830
<v Speaker 2>And they've done it all with like a government team of psychologists who have</v>

232
00:06:30.831 --> 00:06:33.560

235
00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:39.710
<v Speaker 2>And it's not like she's the one who's coming up with that.</v>

236

<v Speaker 2>groped by Donald Trump.</v>

296
00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.500
<v Speaker 2>Anyone who's willing to claim Donald Trump broke them.</v>

297
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:02.870
<v Speaker 2>Anybody wants to get on TV?</v>

298
00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:03.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

299
00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:03.491
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

300
00:08:03.491 --> 00:08:04.324
<v Speaker 2>How you guys failing.</v>

301
00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:04.620
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

302
00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:05.421
<v Speaker 2>but I have a feeling,</v>

303
00:08:05.421 --> 00:08:05.631
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

304
00:08:05.631 --> 00:08:05.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

305
00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:06.860
<v Speaker 2>I don't know for sure,</v>

306
00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:10.550
<v Speaker 2>but my guess would be that if you wanted to find people who said,</v>

307
00:08:10.551 --> 00:08:10.761
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

308
00:08:10.761 --> 00:08:12.020
<v Speaker 2>Trump grabbed my pussy,</v>

309
00:08:12.021 --> 00:08:13.520
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't be that fucking hard.</v>

310
00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:15.680
<v Speaker 2>It's now like you're looking for bigfoot,</v>

311
00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:22.400
<v Speaker 2>pretty easy to hunt them down,</v>

312
00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:24.040
<v Speaker 2>you might guess.</v>

313
00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:24.760
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

314
00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:25.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

315
00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:25.791
<v Speaker 2>But so,</v>

316
00:08:25.791 --> 00:08:27.650
<v Speaker 2>so it wasn't like a hard thing to do.</v>

317
00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.330
<v Speaker 2>It's a bread crumb trail.</v>

318
00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:29.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

319
00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:30.740
<v Speaker 2>He very simple,</v>

320
00:08:30.741 --> 00:08:31.574
<v Speaker 2>very easy.</v>

321
00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:33.740
<v Speaker 2>And so it's like when you realize like that,</v>

322
00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:36.320
<v Speaker 2>then you start feeling this weird compassion for him and you're like,</v>

323
00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:37.251
<v Speaker 2>my God.</v>

324
00:08:37.251 --> 00:08:41.090
<v Speaker 2>Even with all his like maliciousness and like weird per Venus and stuff,</v>

325
00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:42.380
<v Speaker 2>ultimately he,</v>

326
00:08:42.381 --> 00:08:42.711
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

327
00:08:42.711 --> 00:08:47.711
<v Speaker 2>he's like a fucking bowl that got put into a God damn ring with a matador.</v>

328
00:08:47.781 --> 00:08:52.781
<v Speaker 2>He's been doing this kind of bull fighting for like 30 fucking years for better,</v>

329
00:08:52.971 --> 00:08:53.804
<v Speaker 2>for worse.</v>

330
00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:54.950
<v Speaker 2>And he's,</v>

331
00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:57.550
<v Speaker 2>we're watching what we saw last night.</v>

332
00:08:57.551 --> 00:08:58.384
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

333
00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:07.460
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
