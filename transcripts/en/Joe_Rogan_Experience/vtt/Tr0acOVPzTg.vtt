<v Speaker 3>aftershave on my balls to see what it </v>

80
00:03:34.271 --> 00:03:36.910
<v Speaker 3>then you put after shave on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get the splash of light,</v>

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:38.710
<v Speaker 3>but it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

00:10:00.271 --> 00:10:01.180
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm there for,</v>

235
00:10:01.181 --> 00:10:04.950
<v Speaker 4>for that boob jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pretty much any kind of general surgery.</v>

236
00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:06.940
<v Speaker 2>Did he break his nose sparring?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it like,</v>

237
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:08.770
<v Speaker 2>did it actually with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

238
00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:09.550
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

239
00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:11.020
<v Speaker 2>he was doing snatches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

240
00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.990
<v Speaker 2>the barbell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And somehow he manages to waylay himself</v>

241
00:10:13.991 --> 00:10:15.700
<v Speaker 2>right in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He crushed it.</v>

242
00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:18.930
<v Speaker 4>He nailed well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he'd already mangled it.</v>

243
00:10:18.931 --> 00:10:19.790
<v Speaker 4>Pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

244
00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:21.730
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing rugby earlier on.</v>

245
00:10:21.731 --> 00:10:22.410
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

246
00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:28.580
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think in college maybe something like </v>

247
00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:28.580
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he'd been doing rugby for years,</v>

248
00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:30.450
<v Speaker 4>so you'd already known the pleasures of </v>
<v Speaker 4>a broken nose,</v>

249
00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:32.490
<v Speaker 4>but this was just out of nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

250
00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:38.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an interesting debate that's </v>

251
00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:38.450
<v Speaker 2>going on right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

252
00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:41.321
<v Speaker 2>amongst people that are football fans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that are also realizing how much </v>

253
00:10:42.361 --> 00:10:47.361
<v Speaker 2>damage these players take and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to figure out what to do about </v>

254
00:10:47.361 --> 00:10:50.511
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the more interesting ideas </v>

255
00:10:50.511 --> 00:10:53.421
<v Speaker 2>that it's being presented is the idea to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make them wear leather helmets to take </v>

256
00:10:53.421 --> 00:10:57.861
<v Speaker 2>away these big fucking hard helmets that</v>
<v Speaker 2>allow you to crash into each other full </v>

257
00:10:57.861 --> 00:10:59.940
<v Speaker 2>speed and just give you a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that protects your skin.</v>

258
00:10:59.941 --> 00:11:03.480
<v Speaker 2>And that's basically all you got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can't have the same strategy can</v>

259
00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:05.970
<v Speaker 2>go head to head like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't crash into each other,</v>

260
00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:07.860
<v Speaker 2>no pants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>leather helmets.</v>

261
00:11:07.861 --> 00:11:10.260
<v Speaker 2>And the idea is that if they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they rocked it down away,</v>

262
00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.650
<v Speaker 2>we would avoid a lot of these crazy high</v>
<v Speaker 2>speed collision.</v>

263
00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:14.550
<v Speaker 2>People would be more realistic about it.</v>

264
00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:16.880
<v Speaker 4>I think it would cut down on the high </v>
<v Speaker 4>speed collisions.</v>

265
00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:17.790
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you wouldn't,</v>

266
00:11:17.791 --> 00:11:20.820
<v Speaker 4>you wouldn't have people blowing into </v>
<v Speaker 4>each other near as hard.</v>

267
00:11:20.821 --> 00:11:25.821
<v Speaker 4>I've had the argument with people that </v>
<v Speaker 4>are big rugby fanatics for years that </v>

268
00:11:25.821 --> 00:11:25.821
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

269
00:11:25.821 --> 00:11:27.180
<v Speaker 4>rugby guys don't hit as hard as football</v>
<v Speaker 4>players.</v>

270
00:11:27.181 --> 00:11:29.140
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not just that they have pads on us,</v>

271
00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.510
<v Speaker 4>they're huge,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're running fast and those,</v>

272
00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:36.570
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the pads in addition help you to just </v>

273
00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:37.020
<v Speaker 4>like lay everything you got into another</v>
<v Speaker 4>human being.</v>

274
00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:38.400
<v Speaker 4>However,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

275
00:11:38.401 --> 00:11:39.960
<v Speaker 4>let's be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at these monsters.</v>

276
00:11:39.961 --> 00:11:41.130
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you stick them in leather,</v>

277
00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:43.110
<v Speaker 4>they're still gonna start smashing into </v>
<v Speaker 4>each other.</v>

278
00:11:43.111 --> 00:11:46.710
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it's going to stop from </v>
<v Speaker 4>people getting as hurt as bad or</v>

279
00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:52.790
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is like the sports </v>

280
00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:52.890
<v Speaker 2>already developed into what it is and to</v>
<v Speaker 2>try to take it a step back.</v>

281
00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:58.330
<v Speaker 2>Things don't usually go a step back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you want to watch guys in leather </v>

282
00:11:58.330 --> 00:11:58.330
<v Speaker 2>helmet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

283
00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:02.200
<v Speaker 2>Like patty cake and grab each other's </v>
<v Speaker 2>balls and there's a video that's being </v>

284
00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:02.200
<v Speaker 2>played above your head.</v>

285
00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.950
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two bends in the states.</v>

286
00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:07.160
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just so gnarly.</v>

287
00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:09.630
<v Speaker 3>But this is some known.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don said,</v>

288
00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:10.340
<v Speaker 3>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

289
00:12:10.341 --> 00:12:15.341
<v Speaker 3>he just opens a pathway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to say that I was just looking </v>

290
00:12:15.341 --> 00:12:16.030
<v Speaker 3>to see whatever I could find a Jamun </v>
<v Speaker 3>pianist,</v>

291
00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:18.180
<v Speaker 3>his Schnoz anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just for the hell of it,</v>

292
00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:21.350
<v Speaker 3>but it actually makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

293
00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:24.620
<v Speaker 3>it totally makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you can get it to heal in the correct</v>

294
00:12:24.621 --> 00:12:29.621
<v Speaker 3>position,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it won't be nearly as fucked up as if </v>

295
00:12:29.621 --> 00:12:30.020
<v Speaker 3>the cartilage is all bent up in there to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get mine fixed.</v>

296
00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:35.080
<v Speaker 3>I broke it when I was a little kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fell down a flight of stairs my whole </v>

297
00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:38.291
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was fucking nights were really the </v>

298
00:12:38.291 --> 00:12:38.291
<v Speaker 3>only way to really do it if you have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bad enough break,</v>

299
00:12:38.291 --> 00:12:38.510
<v Speaker 3>is to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

300
00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:39.860
<v Speaker 3>to have like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an ear,</v>

301
00:12:39.861 --> 00:12:42.740
<v Speaker 3>nose and throat doctor go in there and </v>
<v Speaker 3>do the proper stuff to it.</v>

302
00:12:42.741 --> 00:12:44.750
<v Speaker 3>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a hellacious coming back from it.</v>

303
00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:46.340
<v Speaker 3>I didn't think it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

304
00:12:46.341 --> 00:12:46.880
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've heard,</v>

305
00:12:46.881 --> 00:12:50.150
<v Speaker 3>I've heard of people like crying blood </v>
<v Speaker 3>out of their eyes and that's pretty cool</v>

306
00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:52.280
<v Speaker 3>and a metal sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Save the buggers.</v>

307
00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:54.650
<v Speaker 3>I'll show you some passive one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

308
00:12:54.651 --> 00:12:57.380
<v Speaker 3>Let me show you something because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't even believe these are real.</v>

309
00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:58.070
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

310
00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.280
<v Speaker 3>I showed one of my buddy Tom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>me and Tommy,</v>

311
00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:03.160
<v Speaker 2>we were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were,</v>

312
00:13:03.161 --> 00:13:08.161
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the airport and I blew this fucking </v>

313
00:13:08.161 --> 00:13:09.040
<v Speaker 2>booger into this tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It did not look real.</v>

314
00:13:09.041 --> 00:13:10.720
<v Speaker 2>It looked like it came from another </v>
<v Speaker 2>planet.</v>

315
00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:14.830
<v Speaker 2>Blood clot fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was huge.</v>

316
00:13:14.831 --> 00:13:16.120
<v Speaker 2>First of all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

317
00:13:16.121 --> 00:13:16.470
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

318
00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:18.400
<v Speaker 2>I've got the photos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've saved them.</v>

319
00:13:18.401 --> 00:13:19.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was no way I was ever going to let</v>

320
00:13:19.691 --> 00:13:21.520
<v Speaker 2>this go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just going to take a few.</v>

321
00:13:21.521 --> 00:13:26.521
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a lot of God damn pictures in </v>

322
00:13:26.521 --> 00:13:26.521
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got to go back to when it was,</v>

323
00:13:26.521 --> 00:13:27.110
<v Speaker 2>which I think was about three years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

324
00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.520
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it changed.</v>

325
00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:31.870
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's my picture.</v>

326
00:13:31.871 --> 00:13:36.550
<v Speaker 2>When I was back in the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd hit it.</v>

327
00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:38.200
<v Speaker 2>I would do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would hit it.</v>

328
00:13:38.201 --> 00:13:40.480
<v Speaker 2>And it's me trying to find these </v>
<v Speaker 2>buggers.</v>

329
00:13:40.481 --> 00:13:44.250
<v Speaker 2>Ma'Am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something literally here couldn't.</v>

330
00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:47.980
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't imagine this coming out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>a human being.</v>

331
00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:50.110
<v Speaker 2>I've put this online,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>

332
00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:51.130
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely did.</v>

333
00:13:51.131 --> 00:13:52.660
<v Speaker 2>I put it on my twitter page.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Brian,</v>

334
00:13:52.661 --> 00:13:54.560
<v Speaker 2>if you could find it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

335
00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:59.080
<v Speaker 2>Joe Rogan's bloody snot on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet there's a photo of it up there.</v>

336
00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:04.710
<v Speaker 2>As long as it stays up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm imagining some comic book villain of</v>

337
00:14:04.901 --> 00:14:06.880
<v Speaker 2>a booger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just unbelievable.</v>

338
00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:08.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't be talking it up this much if</v>

339
00:14:08.861 --> 00:14:11.390
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't really unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for ladies and gentlemen,</v>

340
00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:14.320
<v Speaker 2>if you have a broken nose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you get the inside of the nose fucked</v>

341
00:14:14.321 --> 00:14:14.800
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

342
00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:15.370
<v Speaker 2>if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

343
00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:18.850
<v Speaker 2>I know like mayhem had thought about </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting his fix but he's still fighting.</v>

344
00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:20.590
<v Speaker 2>So it's like I can't do it until I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>

345
00:14:20.591 --> 00:14:23.320
<v Speaker 2>But if you get a chance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the only one.</v>

346
00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:24.580
<v Speaker 2>That's what it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A,</v>

347
00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:27.930
<v Speaker 2>like cartilage and everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just pieces is unbelievable.</v>

348
00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:29.860
<v Speaker 2>And that was the only one that's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>even the biggest one.</v>

349
00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:31.420
<v Speaker 2>I had some other ones that were even </v>
<v Speaker 2>bigger.</v>

350
00:14:31.421 --> 00:14:36.421
<v Speaker 2>They were so ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I blew them out and I looked at him in </v>

351
00:14:36.421 --> 00:14:36.421
<v Speaker 2>my hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

352
00:14:36.421 --> 00:14:39.481
<v Speaker 2>you gotta be fucking kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How'd you feel if that thing came out </v>

353
00:14:39.481 --> 00:14:39.481
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a potato chip came out of my,</v>

354
00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blood giant bloody Nacho.</v>

355
00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:44.170
<v Speaker 2>That's what it was like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

356
00:14:44.171 --> 00:14:46.420
<v Speaker 2>There's a look at the size of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking thing.</v>

357
00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:49.180
<v Speaker 2>That thing came out of my note.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did it tastes like?</v>

358
00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:54.240
<v Speaker 2>Calgon take it wasn't good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It something I would recommend you try </v>

359
00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:54.240
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

360
00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:55.490
<v Speaker 2>it was unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

361
00:14:55.491 --> 00:14:58.080
<v Speaker 2>I would shoot those out of my nose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

362
00:14:58.081 --> 00:14:59.180
<v Speaker 2>it leaves out here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here I was,</v>

363
00:14:59.181 --> 00:15:00.740
<v Speaker 2>I got a bunch of pictures I really need </v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

364
00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:04.630
<v Speaker 2>to get my nose fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I broke it a long time ago,</v>

365
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:05.960
<v Speaker 4>kid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I broke it again.</v>

366
00:15:05.961 --> 00:15:10.390
<v Speaker 4>Really a in this first round of that </v>
<v Speaker 4>super ball tournament and it just,</v>

367
00:15:10.391 --> 00:15:11.510
<v Speaker 4>it bleeds easy now,</v>

368
00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:13.770
<v Speaker 2>which is a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that they,</v>

369
00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:15.990
<v Speaker 2>what do they do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They cauterize the inside.</v>

370
00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:18.960
<v Speaker 2>They've tried doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the way to get up,</v>

371
00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:22.200
<v Speaker 2>I need a doc to get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's impressive.</v>

372
00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:23.460
<v Speaker 2>That's unbelievable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

373
00:15:23.461 --> 00:15:25.830
<v Speaker 2>I blew 100 of those three or four </v>
<v Speaker 2>months.</v>

374
00:15:25.831 --> 00:15:27.300
<v Speaker 2>I hope you have that framed in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>

375
00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:32.880
<v Speaker 2>I should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should just stay in my office or at </v>

376
00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:33.720
<v Speaker 2>least put it in one of those led,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rotating picture frames.</v>

377
00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:36.860
<v Speaker 2>The dog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the kid.</v>

378
00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:40.710
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a great idea,</v>

379
00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.330
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might do that.</v>

380
00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:45.820
<v Speaker 2>I'll do that and put one up in here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what we'll do for the,</v>

381
00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:47.910
<v Speaker 2>for the studio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

382
00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:48.810
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

383
00:15:48.811 --> 00:15:51.040
<v Speaker 2>you're on the last strike force card.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

384
00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:52.060
<v Speaker 2>Is it January</v>

385
00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:55.730
<v Speaker 4>twelfth in the wonderful Oklahoma City?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

386
00:15:55.780 --> 00:16:00.780
<v Speaker 4>we'll be down there a beating the crap </v>
<v Speaker 4>out of each other for the last time </v>

387
00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:00.780
<v Speaker 4>under the strikeforce banner.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

388
00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:04.120
<v Speaker 4>it'll be on showtime as usual so people </v>
<v Speaker 4>will be able to see it.</v>

389
00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:06.410
<v Speaker 2>What did you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tim Kennedy's pissed off.</v>

390
00:16:06.411 --> 00:16:10.100
<v Speaker 2>He thinks that he was mad a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

391
00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:10.850
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

392
00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:11.780
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

393
00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:17.740
<v Speaker 2>high level military dudes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they tend to be a little high strung on </v>

394
00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:17.740
<v Speaker 2>edge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

395
00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:22.720
<v Speaker 2>But he was talking about how he thinks </v>
<v Speaker 2>of all these guys are pulling out </v>

396
00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:23.510
<v Speaker 2>because it's the last card they just </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want to fuck because it won't mean</v>

397
00:16:23.511 --> 00:16:28.511
<v Speaker 2>enough to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to just try to get fights in </v>

398
00:16:28.511 --> 00:16:30.311
<v Speaker 2>the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're just pulling out of the last </v>

399
00:16:30.311 --> 00:16:32.370
<v Speaker 2>strikeforce.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that was what he was </v>

400
00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:32.370
<v Speaker 2>insinuating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was definitely saying that</v>

401
00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:35.890
<v Speaker 4>beyond the realm of possibility for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I look at it and people love to complain</v>

402
00:16:37.251 --> 00:16:38.150
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh well you don't,</v>

403
00:16:38.151 --> 00:16:39.420
<v Speaker 4>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not fighting this guy.</v>

404
00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:41.320
<v Speaker 4>You're not fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're not fighting that fight.</v>

405
00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:43.430
<v Speaker 4>I fight the people that they put in </v>
<v Speaker 4>front of me and,</v>

406
00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:44.840
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're like,</v>

407
00:16:44.841 --> 00:16:45.530
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who the hell is this?</v>

408
00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:46.460
<v Speaker 4>And slash or guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

409
00:16:46.461 --> 00:16:48.200
<v Speaker 4>I don't fucking know and I don't fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>care.</v>

410
00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:51.260
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's just another fucking victim that.</v>

411
00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:55.100
<v Speaker 4>And no matter what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if it was Nan door or junior dos Santos,</v>

412
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:58.460
<v Speaker 4>I get paid the same right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I really don't give a shit.</v>

413
00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:01.040
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I fight who steps up and uh,</v>

414
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:06.430
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's just the way that you're </v>

415
00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:06.430
<v Speaker 4>fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He is impressive looking.</v>

416
00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:09.260
<v Speaker 4>I'll give him that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He does look like he's a man door,</v>

417
00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:12.560
<v Speaker 4>Gill Amino Guild Amino.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't sound Australian to me,</v>

418
00:17:12.561 --> 00:17:13.190
<v Speaker 4>but whatever.</v>

419
00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:15.220
<v Speaker 4>Is that where you're supposedly from?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where he's from.</v>

420
00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:17.120
<v Speaker 4>He's called the Hun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I plan.</v>

421
00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:19.580
<v Speaker 4>I can dig that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The hunt fights for master.</v>

422
00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:21.020
<v Speaker 4>That's pretty intense shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

423
00:17:21.021 --> 00:17:24.410
<v Speaker 4>that sounds a like a like some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>fantasy movie.</v>

424
00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:29.440
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it looks like a big giant end of the </v>

425
00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:29.440
<v Speaker 4>world type dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He does.</v>

426
00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:30.530
<v Speaker 4>He's got a nice big thick brow over his </v>
<v Speaker 4>eyes.</v>

427
00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:35.680
<v Speaker 4>Well his tactics may strikes fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>gigantic and it looks like actually </v>

428
00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:38.180
<v Speaker 4>building.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well they shot it up,</v>

429
00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:39.530
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tricks of camera.</v>

430
00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:40.430
<v Speaker 4>He's like six,</v>
<v Speaker 4>two,</v>

431
00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.380
<v Speaker 4>two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>2130.</v>

432
00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:46.780
<v Speaker 4>So he's a pretty decent sized,</v>
<v Speaker 4>smaller size of the heavy I think.</v>

433
00:17:46.781 --> 00:17:48.260
<v Speaker 4>Just think he likes to do a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>curls.</v>

434
00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:51.030
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he's probably got the tiny legs.</v>

435
00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:56.460
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of those dudes and he's </v>

436
00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:56.460
<v Speaker 2>fighting in the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How's that possible?</v>

437
00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:56.460
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's just a,</v>

438
00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:57.350
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

439
00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:59.660
<v Speaker 4>but he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's got some fights under his belt.</v>

440
00:17:59.661 --> 00:18:01.010
<v Speaker 4>He's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's not like,</v>

441
00:18:01.011 --> 00:18:03.200
<v Speaker 4>he's never been there before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he's 36.</v>

442
00:18:03.201 --> 00:18:05.170
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's gonna come in fit and I.</v>

443
00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:10.210
<v Speaker 4>and he thinks this is his opportunity to</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck somebody up and you think it's </v>

444
00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:10.340
<v Speaker 4>going to be me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>

445
00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:12.740
<v Speaker 4>it looks so that's a big step up for </v>
<v Speaker 4>that dude.</v>

446
00:18:12.741 --> 00:18:13.280
<v Speaker 4>And you know</v>

447
00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:17.220
<v Speaker 2>that happens man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot in mma where guys that someone was</v>

448
00:18:17.221 --> 00:18:18.900
<v Speaker 2>talking about Danny Lozan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe Lowe's,</v>

449
00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:22.110
<v Speaker 2>his brother first fight in UFC fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Spencer Fisher,</v>

450
00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:24.240
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That happens.</v>

451
00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:26.130
<v Speaker 2>That kind of shit happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy.</v>

452
00:18:26.131 --> 00:18:31.131
<v Speaker 2>That's a giant opportunity for him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But really he should like if you looked </v>

453
00:18:31.891 --> 00:18:34.920
<v Speaker 2>at it like in the world of outside of </v>
<v Speaker 2>MMA,</v>

454
00:18:34.921 --> 00:18:39.921
<v Speaker 2>if it was like a boxing thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy would have to go through a lot </v>

455
00:18:39.921 --> 00:18:41.040
<v Speaker 2>more hoops and ladders before he gets to</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Josh Barnett level.</v>

456
00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:46.210
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then the thing with boxing also is </v>

457
00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:48.641
<v Speaker 4>that they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they put their cars together based on </v>

458
00:18:48.641 --> 00:18:51.281
<v Speaker 4>how they can promote it for the back end</v>
<v Speaker 4>dollar or two specific to the bouts </v>

459
00:18:51.281 --> 00:18:52.640
<v Speaker 4>themselves were with him May.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just like,</v>

460
00:18:52.641 --> 00:18:55.340
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have a card or on it.</v>

461
00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:56.390
<v Speaker 4>Let's just have him fight.</v>

462
00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:57.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because a guy like this,</v>

463
00:18:57.911 --> 00:19:00.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean obviously he's got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got a few fights under his belt,</v>

464
00:19:00.971 --> 00:19:03.220
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a former champion,</v>

465
00:19:03.221 --> 00:19:04.930
<v Speaker 2>you're a big name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both in pride,</v>

466
00:19:04.931 --> 00:19:07.150
<v Speaker 2>big name in strikeforce,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big name in the UFC.</v>

467
00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:10.860
<v Speaker 2>Like that doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this is a guy that uh,</v>

468
00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:13.600
<v Speaker 2>if you were banking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

469
00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:16.300
<v Speaker 2>if you see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if it was like Bob Arum,</v>

470
00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:21.600
<v Speaker 2>something like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will probably never scheduled like </v>

471
00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:21.600
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They go,</v>

472
00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:21.600
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can make a lot of money.</v>

473
00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:22.710
<v Speaker 2>I've charged Barnett.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got to move them into a good position</v>

474
00:19:22.711 --> 00:19:25.630
<v Speaker 2>to get them a big name fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's very few big name guys,</v>

475
00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:29.590
<v Speaker 2>especially outside of the UFC that at </v>
<v Speaker 2>this point there's only a few and you're</v>

476
00:19:29.591 --> 00:19:30.850
<v Speaker 2>one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

477
00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:33.790
<v Speaker 2>and outside of you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's really not that many anymore,</v>

478
00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now who else is left?</v>

479
00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:38.610
<v Speaker 4>Just me now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cormier and a</v>

480
00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:40.730
<v Speaker 2>and a fader is done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

481
00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:42.090
<v Speaker 2>he says he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>

482
00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:43.650
<v Speaker 2>he was going to retire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

483
00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:45.700
<v Speaker 2>he was thinking about it apparently at </v>
<v Speaker 2>one point in time.</v>

484
00:19:45.701 --> 00:19:48.240
<v Speaker 2>Then he had a loss and his family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

485
00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:49.530
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he's a,</v>

486
00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:51.980
<v Speaker 4>I believe he's retired.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't really see him coming back.</v>

487
00:19:51.981 --> 00:19:53.930
<v Speaker 4>If he does,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it won't be for some time.</v>

488
00:19:53.931 --> 00:19:58.550
<v Speaker 4>I just don't think that fighting is so </v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely necessary to him.</v>

489
00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:01.040
<v Speaker 4>I think he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he may be looking at different stages in</v>

490
00:20:01.041 --> 00:20:04.760
<v Speaker 4>his life and I think from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from how I know him anyways,</v>

491
00:20:04.761 --> 00:20:09.761
<v Speaker 4>he seems pretty content with the things </v>
<v Speaker 4>that he's doing outside of fighting and </v>

492
00:20:09.761 --> 00:20:12.320
<v Speaker 4>happy with family and church and things </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>

493
00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:16.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he definitely doesn't have the same last</v>

494
00:20:16.671 --> 00:20:19.360
<v Speaker 2>for it that he had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when he fought cro cop,</v>

495
00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:22.580
<v Speaker 2>like back in those days I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I considered that like his prime,</v>

496
00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:26.110
<v Speaker 2>like the one of the first cro cop fight </v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

497
00:20:26.111 --> 00:20:27.110
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just,</v>

498
00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:28.790
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he went after him on the feet,</v>

499
00:20:28.791 --> 00:20:32.060
<v Speaker 2>like he basically walked down like one </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the best kick boxers and mma.</v>

500
00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:34.590
<v Speaker 4>Well that's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're fighting a good striker,</v>

501
00:20:34.591 --> 00:20:35.740
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got a and,</v>

502
00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:39.570
<v Speaker 4>and that fueled or wanted to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Needed to put him on his back.</v>

503
00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:45.320
<v Speaker 4>So he had to close that distance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the only way you can't just walk </v>

504
00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:45.320
<v Speaker 4>into them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to get tagged up,</v>

505
00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:47.070
<v Speaker 4>meaning he got cracked with a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>good shots.</v>

506
00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:52.250
<v Speaker 4>He had yet to be aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to be quick coming forward and </v>

507
00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:52.500
<v Speaker 4>then initiate those opportunities to put</v>
<v Speaker 4>them on his back.</v>

508
00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:53.880
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every time I fought cro cop,</v>

509
00:20:53.881 --> 00:20:55.270
<v Speaker 4>I came forward to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because again,</v>

510
00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:57.660
<v Speaker 4>if I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I want to put them on the floor,</v>

511
00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:02.990
<v Speaker 4>I can't do it backing up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And everybody that backs up the more </v>

512
00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:02.990
<v Speaker 4>distance you give a guy like cro cop,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially back then,</v>

513
00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:05.330
<v Speaker 4>the more he would look for is </v>
<v Speaker 4>opportunity to land kill shot,</v>

514
00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:09.010
<v Speaker 4>then fucking left high kick or just a </v>
<v Speaker 4>middle kick or you know,</v>

515
00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:10.610
<v Speaker 4>he was a hellacious low kicker too.</v>

516
00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:11.980
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

517
00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:17.100
<v Speaker 4>he uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>filter look great in his last couple of </v>

518
00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:17.100
<v Speaker 4>bouts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Looked real sharp,</v>

519
00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:18.390
<v Speaker 4>but I think it was more just to prove to</v>
<v Speaker 4>himself that he could do it.</v>

520
00:21:18.391 --> 00:21:18.820
<v Speaker 4>That,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

521
00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:23.840
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well I have the ability and I can stay </v>

522
00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:26.670
<v Speaker 4>in here and be a top guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I've done this and I'm good.</v>

523
00:21:26.671 --> 00:21:29.430
<v Speaker 4>And I guess his brother just recently </v>
<v Speaker 4>retired also,</v>

524
00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:31.940
<v Speaker 4>and then uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

525
00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:37.180
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tim Silvia is still out there and </v>

526
00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:37.180
<v Speaker 4>around,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

527
00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:40.190
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's got a pedigree and he has </v>
<v Speaker 4>still a pretty high high record of wins </v>

528
00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:44.571
<v Speaker 4>versus losses and Arlovski is trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>make a run back into the limelight as </v>

529
00:21:44.761 --> 00:21:45.900
<v Speaker 4>far as being a top everywhere.</v>

530
00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:46.660
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lost.</v>

531
00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:49.070
<v Speaker 2>He's actually doing really well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's uh,</v>

532
00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:49.700
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

533
00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:53.510
<v Speaker 2>he actually just beat Tim Wright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He beat Tim and then he was disqualified</v>

534
00:21:53.511 --> 00:21:55.130
<v Speaker 2>because of an illegal soccer kick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

535
00:21:55.131 --> 00:21:56.730
<v Speaker 2>I have a weird rule.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a one.</v>

536
00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:58.680
<v Speaker 2>Is that one FC?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that Matt?</v>

537
00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:00.220
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Matt Hume's old,</v>

538
00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:05.370
<v Speaker 4>a pancreas pro pankration rules in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Washington and they had this open guard </v>

539
00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:08.440
<v Speaker 4>a call things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it was like the,</v>

540
00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:13.450
<v Speaker 4>I guess the deal was you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not supposed to spend a long </v>

541
00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:13.450
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I fought and washing.</v>

542
00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:18.030
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me explain it to people that don't </v>

543
00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:18.030
<v Speaker 2>know what we're talking about for most </v>
<v Speaker 2>fights,</v>

544
00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:19.980
<v Speaker 2>you can't kick a guy in the head when </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's down.</v>

545
00:22:19.981 --> 00:22:24.840
<v Speaker 2>You can only kick the body and the legs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in pride and the old school days,</v>

546
00:22:24.841 --> 00:22:27.000
<v Speaker 2>you could do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could stomp guys,</v>

547
00:22:27.001 --> 00:22:28.140
<v Speaker 2>you could soccer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kick them,</v>

548
00:22:28.141 --> 00:22:31.170
<v Speaker 2>you could do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of people miss that technique.</v>

549
00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:36.210
<v Speaker 2>So there's open guard thing is where </v>
<v Speaker 2>they allow the kicks stops as well.</v>

550
00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:37.270
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

551
00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:39.440
<v Speaker 4>maybe no stomps.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe just kicks.</v>

552
00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:43.130
<v Speaker 4>I believe it just kicks A.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd have to pencil long,</v>

553
00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:44.730
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

554
00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:47.810
<v Speaker 4>but once they call open guard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you're free to do,</v>

555
00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:48.430
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

556
00:22:48.431 --> 00:22:53.431
<v Speaker 4>I believe it was taken from Valley Tudo </v>
<v Speaker 4>Japan or something similar way back in </v>

557
00:22:53.431 --> 00:22:54.860
<v Speaker 4>the day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was like if you're on your back,</v>

558
00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:57.800
<v Speaker 4>guy can go ahead and come around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And soccer kick at your head.</v>

559
00:22:57.850 --> 00:23:01.030
<v Speaker 2>Is the idea that if you've rocked and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're down,</v>

560
00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:03.550
<v Speaker 2>is that when he would not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when would he not let you?</v>

561
00:23:03.551 --> 00:23:05.950
<v Speaker 2>Soccer of all fours I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

562
00:23:05.951 --> 00:23:07.370
<v Speaker 2>So if you scratch like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've,</v>

563
00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:08.410
<v Speaker 2>you're down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're hurt,</v>

564
00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:10.010
<v Speaker 2>then you can't soccer kick guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

565
00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:11.890
<v Speaker 2>then he would stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if he went to his back,</v>

566
00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:13.300
<v Speaker 2>that would be open guard and you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk.</v>

567
00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:14.230
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>

568
00:23:14.231 --> 00:23:19.231
<v Speaker 2>So only when the guy's on his back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I guess the idea is that your </v>

569
00:23:19.231 --> 00:23:19.231
<v Speaker 2>legs and your hands are up in front of </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

570
00:23:19.231 --> 00:23:20.290
<v Speaker 2>so you're protecting yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That totally.</v>

571
00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:24.440
<v Speaker 2>That actually is very logical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Japanese had a lot of very logical,</v>

572
00:23:24.441 --> 00:23:26.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>approaches to mma.</v>

573
00:23:26.201 --> 00:23:28.810
<v Speaker 2>One of them that I really liked was that</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 minute first round.</v>

574
00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:30.360
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a brutal fight.</v>

575
00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:32.290
<v Speaker 2>That really separated the men from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>boys.</v>

576
00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:36.280
<v Speaker 2>Did that round was the endurance </v>
<v Speaker 2>breaker.</v>

577
00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:41.400
<v Speaker 2>I liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I loved that you go out there and you </v>

578
00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:41.400
<v Speaker 2>just get it on some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

579
00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:44.870
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to strategize your wind and </v>

580
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:44.870
<v Speaker 4>your endurance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

581
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:44.870
<v Speaker 4>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

582
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:46.700
<v Speaker 4>we didn't stop a lot of us from still </v>
<v Speaker 4>just going nonstop,</v>

583
00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:47.480
<v Speaker 4>10 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

584
00:23:47.481 --> 00:23:48.910
<v Speaker 4>We'd just go for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

585
00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:51.380
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>coming from a guy like me who started in</v>

586
00:23:51.381 --> 00:23:53.300
<v Speaker 4>the days of no time limits,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

587
00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:53.870
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

588
00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:54.930
<v Speaker 2>And well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

589
00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:59.960
<v Speaker 2>for a guy like you also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sometimes you would work for a </v>

590
00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:00.540
<v Speaker 2>while to get a takedown and you finally </v>
<v Speaker 2>get to take down.</v>

591
00:24:00.541 --> 00:24:01.890
<v Speaker 2>You only got 20 seconds left than </v>
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>

592
00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:06.900
<v Speaker 2>The guy can defend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if there's five minutes and 20 </v>

593
00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:10.101
<v Speaker 2>seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's fucked right now and get a lot of </v>

594
00:24:10.101 --> 00:24:10.170
<v Speaker 2>work in on a guy and five slash 12 that </v>
<v Speaker 2>really favor.</v>

595
00:24:10.171 --> 00:24:15.171
<v Speaker 2>I mean that was one of the main </v>
<v Speaker 2>arguments for not having three minute </v>

596
00:24:15.171 --> 00:24:17.961
<v Speaker 2>rounds in the first place is that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to give the grappler sometime to </v>

597
00:24:17.961 --> 00:24:17.961
<v Speaker 2>work once he completed the tank down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

598
00:24:17.961 --> 00:24:20.820
<v Speaker 2>But if you look at like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like consider the exertion that they put</v>

599
00:24:20.821 --> 00:24:23.910
<v Speaker 2>off in a boxing rounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boxing the high level of boxing runs,</v>

600
00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:28.920
<v Speaker 2>it's really not even nearly as </v>
<v Speaker 2>devastating as a high level MMA right </v>

601
00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:28.920
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

602
00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:33.390
<v Speaker 4>It's different because you don't have </v>
<v Speaker 4>that muscle fatigue from constant wear </v>

603
00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:35.250
<v Speaker 4>and and resistance and it's a different </v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of conditioning.</v>

604
00:24:35.251 --> 00:24:38.660
<v Speaker 4>Or you can take a guy who's an excellent</v>
<v Speaker 4>wrestler who's got fantastic when,</v>

605
00:24:38.661 --> 00:24:41.190
<v Speaker 4>when it comes to to contact and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

606
00:24:41.191 --> 00:24:45.190
<v Speaker 4>and resistance and strength and balance </v>
<v Speaker 4>that way against another opponent.</v>

607
00:24:45.191 --> 00:24:50.191
<v Speaker 4>But you get out there and you start </v>
<v Speaker 4>putting all these punches together and </v>

608
00:24:50.191 --> 00:24:51.340
<v Speaker 4>all of a sudden his wind is gone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>got blasted because it's a different.</v>

609
00:24:51.341 --> 00:24:55.930
<v Speaker 4>It's more akin to more of an aerobic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anaerobic just wind based,</v>

610
00:24:55.931 --> 00:24:57.970
<v Speaker 4>then it's a different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's completely different.</v>

611
00:24:58.050 --> 00:25:00.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting how it doesn't apply,</v>

612
00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:02.430
<v Speaker 2>like fitness does not apply across the </v>
<v Speaker 2>board.</v>

613
00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:02.870
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

614
00:25:02.871 --> 00:25:07.871
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the thing is that the </v>

615
00:25:07.871 --> 00:25:07.871
<v Speaker 2>Olympic,</v>

616
00:25:07.871 --> 00:25:10.500
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Olympic committees have done all </v>

617
00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:10.500
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

618
00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:10.500
<v Speaker 4>these studies like committees,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>

619
00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:10.810
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

620
00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:16.880
<v Speaker 4>all the people that come with all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>science and the training behind these </v>

621
00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:17.880
<v Speaker 4>Olympic athletes and that is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can do sports specific training.</v>

622
00:25:17.881 --> 00:25:20.250
<v Speaker 4>You can go ahead and shoot doubles with </v>
<v Speaker 4>bands on,</v>

623
00:25:20.251 --> 00:25:25.251
<v Speaker 4>you can punch with dumbbells,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can do all this stuff to try and </v>

624
00:25:25.251 --> 00:25:26.070
<v Speaker 4>simulate doing your sport,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but in the end,</v>

625
00:25:26.071 --> 00:25:29.760
<v Speaker 4>the only thing that makes you better at </v>
<v Speaker 4>your sport and the most,</v>

626
00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:34.850
<v Speaker 4>especially in terms of endurance and </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything else is to actually do your </v>

627
00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:38.841
<v Speaker 4>sport.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But because your body learns how to </v>

628
00:25:38.841 --> 00:25:38.841
<v Speaker 4>relax,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it has muscle memory.</v>

629
00:25:38.841 --> 00:25:40.010
<v Speaker 4>It has a um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

630
00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:42.480
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your brain understands all the movements</v>

631
00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:47.860
<v Speaker 4>and dynamics of exactly what you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing and that's how it learns to be as </v>

632
00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:49.920
<v Speaker 4>most efficient as possible in your </v>
<v Speaker 4>sport.</v>

633
00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:51.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so it's great.</v>

634
00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:56.180
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all these strength conditioning guys </v>

635
00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:56.180
<v Speaker 4>have come out of the woodwork,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially I love all the guys that have</v>

636
00:25:56.180 --> 00:26:00.321
<v Speaker 4>no fight training or fights under their </v>
<v Speaker 4>belt and they want to go and they train </v>

637
00:26:00.321 --> 00:26:04.071
<v Speaker 4>all these fighters with all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They see a Jim Jones or crossfit or a </v>

638
00:26:04.071 --> 00:26:08.480
<v Speaker 4>now westside barbell and these are all </v>
<v Speaker 4>great systems that have amazing things </v>

639
00:26:09.121 --> 00:26:11.640
<v Speaker 4>to take from it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I could have the best workout in the</v>

640
00:26:11.641 --> 00:26:14.040
<v Speaker 4>world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it might not be the best workout for</v>

641
00:26:14.130 --> 00:26:19.130
<v Speaker 4>this particular type of athlete and not </v>
<v Speaker 4>to mention he can do the best work out </v>

642
00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:22.881
<v Speaker 4>in the world all day long.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If his time in the sport that he's </v>

643
00:26:22.881 --> 00:26:25.380
<v Speaker 4>actually doing is not being applied,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it's a waste.</v>

644
00:26:25.381 --> 00:26:30.381
<v Speaker 4>You're not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to really be able to </v>

645
00:26:30.381 --> 00:26:30.381
<v Speaker 4>make the most of it.</v>

646
00:26:30.381 --> 00:26:31.960
<v Speaker 2>You feel like there's a certain level of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the game were strengthened.</v>

647
00:26:31.961 --> 00:26:36.961
<v Speaker 2>Condition is absolutely necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can get to like a rory macdonald </v>

648
00:26:36.961 --> 00:26:37.330
<v Speaker 2>athlete level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like absolutely.</v>

649
00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:39.850
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this kid at 23,</v>

650
00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:41.200
<v Speaker 2>24,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

651
00:26:41.201 --> 00:26:43.150
<v Speaker 2>He's young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a freakish and,</v>

652
00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:48.180
<v Speaker 2>and he's so fucking athletic and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing these incredible strength and </v>

653
00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:51.210
<v Speaker 2>conditioning workouts along with all his</v>
<v Speaker 2>sports specific shit.</v>

654
00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:56.540
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I absolutely agree with you </v>

655
00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:59.961
<v Speaker 2>that the most important thing is </v>
<v Speaker 2>technique and efficiency and training </v>

656
00:26:59.971 --> 00:27:02.640
<v Speaker 2>and sparring and timing and Mitt work </v>
<v Speaker 2>and all that good stuff.</v>

657
00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:07.940
<v Speaker 2>But there's also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get to a Roy Mcdonald level where </v>

658
00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:11.640
<v Speaker 2>he's got Roy Mcdonald.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has that as well.</v>

659
00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:15.690
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got all the training all the time,</v>

660
00:27:15.691 --> 00:27:18.390
<v Speaker 2>putting in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in all the intensity and the drills.</v>

661
00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:20.460
<v Speaker 2>But then he also has this</v>

662
00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:22.560
<v Speaker 4>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was I actually,</v>

663
00:27:22.561 --> 00:27:23.170
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

664
00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:28.700
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unofficially named that laugh that UFC </v>

665
00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:29.460
<v Speaker 4>on Fox a card I called the UFC on Fox </v>
<v Speaker 4>five speed kills.</v>

666
00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:34.760
<v Speaker 4>Basically everybody who is faster,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more conditioned and quicker beat their </v>

667
00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:36.050
<v Speaker 4>opponents.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well really what it came down to,</v>

668
00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:37.800
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a Benson,</v>

669
00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:41.100
<v Speaker 4>a Rory Gustafson,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of them were quicker.</v>

670
00:27:41.101 --> 00:27:42.660
<v Speaker 4>They were quicker to the punch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were better.</v>

671
00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:44.140
<v Speaker 4>They seem to be better condition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

672
00:27:44.141 --> 00:27:46.860
<v Speaker 4>they pushed the pace higher and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>beat all their opponents.</v>

673
00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:51.980
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they had great skillsets and great game </v>

674
00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:51.980
<v Speaker 4>plans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they moved so much,</v>

675
00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:56.680
<v Speaker 4>so much and had so much more speed over </v>
<v Speaker 4>their opponents that they just couldn't </v>

676
00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:57.240
<v Speaker 4>keep up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

677
00:27:57.690 --> 00:27:59.760
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the athleticism,</v>

678
00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:02.100
<v Speaker 4>strength conditioning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a huge equalizer,</v>

679
00:28:02.101 --> 00:28:04.470
<v Speaker 4>called God's Lord say technique within </v>
<v Speaker 4>strength.</v>

680
00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:09.500
<v Speaker 4>If you're not strong enough and physical</v>
<v Speaker 4>enough to pull off a ship and you're </v>

681
00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:09.500
<v Speaker 4>trying to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it ain't gonna work,</v>

682
00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:09.990
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And</v>

683
00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:15.290
<v Speaker 2>that's such an important point because </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's sort of denied in the Jiu Jitsu </v>

684
00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:15.510
<v Speaker 2>community a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

685
00:28:15.511 --> 00:28:17.340
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people say I'm wearing </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

686
00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:18.840
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is no disrespect.</v>

687
00:28:18.841 --> 00:28:22.500
<v Speaker 2>And I got to Leo Gracie tee shirt on </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now when I'm saying this and work</v>

688
00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:25.500
<v Speaker 4>requires a lot of strength and I've </v>
<v Speaker 4>trained with all the,</v>

689
00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:29.380
<v Speaker 4>with a lot of top,</v>
<v Speaker 4>high level Jujitsu guys are legends like</v>

690
00:28:29.381 --> 00:28:31.110
<v Speaker 4>Henzel Gracie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've rolled with these dudes.</v>

691
00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:36.410
<v Speaker 4>And even as a kid I remember hearing all</v>
<v Speaker 4>the rhetoric about Jujitsu and the </v>

692
00:28:36.410 --> 00:28:38.490
<v Speaker 4>gentle way and all this and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no energy and effortless.</v>

693
00:28:38.491 --> 00:28:41.190
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck that.</v>

694
00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:46.580
<v Speaker 4>These dudes are strong as shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They do everything with a huge amount of</v>

695
00:28:47.371 --> 00:28:48.840
<v Speaker 4>strength.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have a lot of technique,</v>

696
00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:53.870
<v Speaker 4>but the difference like the difference </v>
<v Speaker 4>between like this Hen i Henzel and this </v>

697
00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:55.800
<v Speaker 4>is back in Abu Dhabi and this other </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking,</v>

698
00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:59.910
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>black belt champion Schmo from Brazil is</v>

699
00:28:59.911 --> 00:29:02.690
<v Speaker 4>that black belt Schmo from Brazil does </v>
<v Speaker 4>the same move.</v>

700
00:29:02.691 --> 00:29:07.691
<v Speaker 4>The hanzo does,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it handles like fucking three times </v>

701
00:29:07.691 --> 00:29:07.691
<v Speaker 4>as strong as that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

702
00:29:07.691 --> 00:29:09.910
<v Speaker 2>And he's going after it wrestling style </v>
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>

703
00:29:09.911 --> 00:29:14.911
<v Speaker 2>He's like snapping your head down and </v>
<v Speaker 2>clamping down on a guillotine and </v>

704
00:29:14.911 --> 00:29:18.720
<v Speaker 2>yanking on it and put this mist on you </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're trying to get your hand away </v>

705
00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:21.871
<v Speaker 2>and you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tell them I'm a lifelong of grappling </v>

706
00:29:21.871 --> 00:29:22.150
<v Speaker 2>strength today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No question.</v>

707
00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:24.160
<v Speaker 2>Perfect technique,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no question,</v>

708
00:29:24.370 --> 00:29:26.830
<v Speaker 2>but absolutely strong given,</v>
<v Speaker 2>given a,</v>

709
00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:30.160
<v Speaker 4>an uneven playing field are given,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even techniques,</v>

710
00:29:30.161 --> 00:29:32.170
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even on the technique side of the person</v>

711
00:29:32.171 --> 00:29:34.180
<v Speaker 4>who is stronger and faster is going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>apply it better.</v>

712
00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:34.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

713
00:29:34.681 --> 00:29:37.160
<v Speaker 2>I always had this theory about Hickson </v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

714
00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:39.080
<v Speaker 2>one of the theories about Hixon that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>always say,</v>

715
00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:44.270
<v Speaker 2>if people know Hixon Gracie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was always considered to be the </v>

716
00:29:44.270 --> 00:29:45.330
<v Speaker 2>greatest of the Gracie clan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like a magician on them.</v>

717
00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:48.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But also like weight way more built.</v>

718
00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:53.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you compare him to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well he is raising a physical specimen,</v>

719
00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:58.200
<v Speaker 2>especially when he was young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he was just like a perfect </v>

720
00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:58.200
<v Speaker 2>athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you,</v>

721
00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:01.581
<v Speaker 2>if you think about him when those days </v>
<v Speaker 2>he got more taps in because he was </v>

722
00:30:01.581 --> 00:30:04.510
<v Speaker 2>stronger and he was like physically he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a freak.</v>

723
00:30:04.511 --> 00:30:06.410
<v Speaker 2>Like he was a great Yogi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like a,</v>

724
00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:10.810
<v Speaker 2>like a really an avid yoga practitioner </v>
<v Speaker 2>that belly flexibility,</v>

725
00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:15.310
<v Speaker 2>strength and body control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mind watching them go at it with people</v>

726
00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:19.210
<v Speaker 4>go hard fast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those clips from those Samo tournaments,</v>

727
00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:21.800
<v Speaker 4>he just sign onto people's limbs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

728
00:30:21.810 --> 00:30:24.620
<v Speaker 4>there ain't nothing like smooth </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>

729
00:30:24.621 --> 00:30:27.450
<v Speaker 4>like just chilling out and catching an </v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my friend y'all.</v>

730
00:30:27.451 --> 00:30:27.950
<v Speaker 4>How are y'all?</v>

731
00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:29.690
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy's like,</v>

732
00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:31.350
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like a,</v>

733
00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:33.680
<v Speaker 2>he's like a fucking blast beat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

734
00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:36.730
<v Speaker 2>from a death metal song.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just chewing through somebody's body.</v>

735
00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:41.880
<v Speaker 2>I love that a guy like that exists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that there's a guy that is the </v>

736
00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:43.630
<v Speaker 2>one guy that stands above everyone else.</v>

737
00:30:43.650 --> 00:30:47.520
<v Speaker 4>You know what I've always heard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not to create rumors and not to say that</v>

738
00:30:47.521 --> 00:30:50.820
<v Speaker 4>any of the people a fore mentioned ever </v>
<v Speaker 4>said as such either because,</v>

739
00:30:50.821 --> 00:30:51.870
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

740
00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:56.280
<v Speaker 4>they've never with this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't you never ever,</v>

<v Speaker 4>or try to like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

743
00:31:00.781 --> 00:31:01.750
<v Speaker 4>run around and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

744
00:31:01.751 --> 00:31:02.370
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

745
00:31:02.371 --> 00:31:04.200
<v Speaker 4>behind the scenes I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

746
00:31:04.201 --> 00:31:09.201
<v Speaker 4>but really he's not that kind of guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I've always heard that from people </v>

747
00:31:09.201 --> 00:31:13.890
<v Speaker 4>that have trained with both of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that Laborio is considered even better.</v>

748
00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:19.020
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a very funny thing that you said </v>

749
00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:20.881
<v Speaker 2>that I was going to say Laborio is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other guy that has that sort of Laborio </v>

750
00:31:20.881 --> 00:31:22.330
<v Speaker 2>is like the most approachable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>friendliest,</v>

751
00:31:22.331 --> 00:31:23.080
<v Speaker 2>sweetest guy.</v>

752
00:31:23.530 --> 00:31:26.060
<v Speaker 4>She'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And laboriel even say about,</v>

753
00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:27.650
<v Speaker 4>he'll talk about his competition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

754
00:31:27.651 --> 00:31:32.651
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just wasn't able to do as much in </v>

755
00:31:32.651 --> 00:31:34.980
<v Speaker 4>competition as I had wanted to or as I </v>
<v Speaker 4>was capable of on the mats.</v>

756
00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:35.720
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's not,</v>

757
00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:38.150
<v Speaker 4>he's a humble,</v>
<v Speaker 4>straightforward,</v>

758
00:31:38.390 --> 00:31:40.240
<v Speaker 4>no nonsense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just a,</v>

759
00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:45.310
<v Speaker 4>he's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's not going to bullshit about any of </v>

760
00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:47.411
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's not going to sit back and start </v>

761
00:31:47.411 --> 00:31:47.411
<v Speaker 4>naming off all these excuses or </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

762
00:31:47.411 --> 00:31:47.411
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>

763
00:31:47.411 --> 00:31:47.411
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that day I just,</v>

764
00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:48.530
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't able to.</v>

765
00:31:48.531 --> 00:31:49.520
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

766
00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:51.770
<v Speaker 4>I should have taken that guy out and </v>
<v Speaker 4>like a minute.</v>

767
00:31:51.771 --> 00:31:56.771
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for whatever reason that it just didn't </v>

768
00:31:56.771 --> 00:31:56.810
<v Speaker 4>work out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe my head or this or whatever.</v>

769
00:31:56.811 --> 00:31:57.300
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he does.</v>

770
00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:58.560
<v Speaker 4>He's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's not a,</v>

771
00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:03.660
<v Speaker 4>some cocky sort of dude trying to make,</v>
<v Speaker 4>give himself an out to why he didn't </v>

772
00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:04.280
<v Speaker 4>perform as what he wanted.</v>

773
00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:09.310
<v Speaker 4>But that's one of the reasons why I </v>
<v Speaker 4>liked that guy so much because I know </v>

774
00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:10.280
<v Speaker 4>how good he is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I even watching them back in the day and</v>

775
00:32:10.281 --> 00:32:11.120
<v Speaker 4>I'd tell him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh man,</v>

776
00:32:11.121 --> 00:32:12.200
<v Speaker 4>that was a really good match.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

777
00:32:12.201 --> 00:32:13.250
<v Speaker 4>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

778
00:32:13.251 --> 00:32:13.970
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was cool.</v>

779
00:32:13.971 --> 00:32:15.110
<v Speaker 4>It was all right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

780
00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:20.920
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd heard from all from these other </v>

781
00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:20.920
<v Speaker 4>Jujitsu guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

782
00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:23.701
<v Speaker 4>man laborio actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the dude and people don't talk </v>

783
00:32:23.701 --> 00:32:26.891
<v Speaker 4>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's the guy that they think is </v>

784
00:32:26.891 --> 00:32:26.910
<v Speaker 4>Charles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Charles Mccarthy was the first person to</v>

785
00:32:26.911 --> 00:32:28.540
<v Speaker 4>told me that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but chainsaw.</v>

786
00:32:28.550 --> 00:32:28.770
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

787
00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:29.480
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

788
00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:32.510
<v Speaker 2>he told me a long time ago and then I </v>
<v Speaker 2>started asking around,</v>

789
00:32:32.511 --> 00:32:34.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was only like a blue belt purple belt,</v>

790
00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:36.170
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't really know who the great </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys were.</v>

791
00:32:36.171 --> 00:32:41.171
<v Speaker 2>But he said the other guy that was like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that with him that people don't give </v>

792
00:32:41.171 --> 00:32:41.171
<v Speaker 2>enough credit to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said was travis Luder.</v>

793
00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:43.340
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Travis Luder is a lot better than people</v>

794
00:32:43.341 --> 00:32:44.300
<v Speaker 2>gave him credit for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

795
00:32:44.301 --> 00:32:47.630
<v Speaker 2>he never really got his shit together </v>
<v Speaker 2>like conditioning wise and had a few.</v>

796
00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:49.890
<v Speaker 4>Travis is tough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We all knew that.</v>

797
00:32:49.891 --> 00:32:52.560
<v Speaker 4>He was a pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pretty talented when it came to,</v>

798
00:32:52.561 --> 00:32:53.410
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

799
00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:55.470
<v Speaker 4>to his grappling skills on the mat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

800
00:32:55.471 --> 00:32:57.420
<v Speaker 4>he very underrated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was Terry,</v>

801
00:32:57.460 --> 00:33:00.390
<v Speaker 4>let's be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He put Anderson on his back and did what</v>

802
00:33:00.391 --> 00:33:01.240
<v Speaker 4>he wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just moved.</v>

803
00:33:01.241 --> 00:33:01.290
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

804
00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:05.810
<v Speaker 2>Let me tell you something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The day before travis looked like a dead</v>

805
00:33:05.811 --> 00:33:06.680
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

806
00:33:06.681 --> 00:33:10.280
<v Speaker 2>I've.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen a guy in all my years of</v>

807
00:33:10.281 --> 00:33:12.830
<v Speaker 2>being at the weigh ins and that's over </v>
<v Speaker 2>12 years now.</v>

808
00:33:12.831 --> 00:33:14.420
<v Speaker 2>More than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you count the nineties,</v>

809
00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:20.020
<v Speaker 2>he was dead dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He shuffled to the scale for his second </v>

810
00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:24.431
<v Speaker 2>attempt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like literally couldn't lift his feet </v>

811
00:33:24.431 --> 00:33:24.431
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The chores were married up there.</v>

812
00:33:24.431 --> 00:33:25.220
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Looked horrible.</v>

813
00:33:25.221 --> 00:33:30.221
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen a guy who his lips were </v>
<v Speaker 2>cracked and dried out like he had sucked</v>

814
00:33:30.441 --> 00:33:33.830
<v Speaker 2>himself dry like a sponge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was still more than a pound over.</v>

815
00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:35.540
<v Speaker 2>He couldn't make it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He couldn't make the way.</v>

816
00:33:35.541 --> 00:33:37.490
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember what the final thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

817
00:33:37.491 --> 00:33:40.030
<v Speaker 2>but he just fits right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever happened,</v>

818
00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:45.040
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't a title fight and he was </v>

819
00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:45.740
<v Speaker 2>dominating him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he ran out of juice.</v>

820
00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:51.780
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure most of it was due to even </v>
<v Speaker 4>because he pooped out in mountain was </v>

821
00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:56.320
<v Speaker 4>physical exertion and his muscles just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They didn't have enough energy to power </v>

822
00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:56.520
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They didn't have any electrolytes.</v>

823
00:33:56.530 --> 00:33:59.630
<v Speaker 4>You didn't have a mineral is needed to </v>
<v Speaker 4>keep those things going and they just,</v>

824
00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:00.530
<v Speaker 4>they just gave up.</v>

825
00:34:00.550 --> 00:34:05.550
<v Speaker 2>That one drives me crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of guys that I've seen </v>

826
00:34:05.550 --> 00:34:05.550
<v Speaker 2>fall apart.</v>

827
00:34:05.550 --> 00:34:09.690
<v Speaker 4>Honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It hadn't been so exhausted and you </v>

828
00:34:09.690 --> 00:34:09.690
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

829
00:34:09.690 --> 00:34:11.500
<v Speaker 4>that's up to look at saluter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

830
00:34:11.501 --> 00:34:12.620
<v Speaker 4>And his coaches.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>

831
00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:14.920
<v Speaker 4>I think he probably would have tapped </v>
<v Speaker 4>into</v>

832
00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:19.860
<v Speaker 2>luder luder in top form in that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alluded that was not sick.</v>

833
00:34:19.861 --> 00:34:22.290
<v Speaker 2>Would it get in the Anderson Silva a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of problems.</v>

834
00:34:22.470 --> 00:34:24.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean Anderson is a lot better on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ground and people think,</v>

835
00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:26.160
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's very wily.</v>

836
00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:31.720
<v Speaker 4>Luder is so his more similar to like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>another guy that people don't </v>

837
00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:35.271
<v Speaker 4>understand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a Picasso who tapped Anderson from </v>

838
00:34:35.271 --> 00:34:35.271
<v Speaker 4>amount,</v>
<v Speaker 4>amount of triangle,</v>

839
00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:37.560
<v Speaker 4>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it ended up being mounted,</v>

840
00:34:37.561 --> 00:34:40.320
<v Speaker 4>but I started off on the back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but a part of the reason why he,</v>

841
00:34:40.321 --> 00:34:42.170
<v Speaker 4>I believe he tap Anderson and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

842
00:34:42.220 --> 00:34:47.220
<v Speaker 4>and you can see that backstage footage </v>
<v Speaker 4>from pride and Anderson is so upset </v>

843
00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:47.220
<v Speaker 4>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

844
00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:50.640
<v Speaker 4>And I know in my opinion why he's so </v>
<v Speaker 4>upset that he lost,</v>

845
00:34:50.910 --> 00:34:55.910
<v Speaker 4>wasn't he?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because he can't believe he got caught </v>

846
00:34:55.910 --> 00:34:55.980
<v Speaker 4>like that is because what he didn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand is to.</v>

847
00:34:55.981 --> 00:34:58.830
<v Speaker 4>Casa is one of those dudes that has </v>
<v Speaker 4>freak strength,</v>

848
00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:04.340
<v Speaker 4>like unreal crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like his arm feels like a pile of steel </v>

849
00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:06.840
<v Speaker 4>strength when he gets a hold of you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I rolled with the dude and the guy.</v>

850
00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:07.920
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit,</v>

851
00:35:07.921 --> 00:35:09.840
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe how strong this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I remember when Vernon,</v>

852
00:35:10.290 --> 00:35:11.280
<v Speaker 4>Vernon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>White Russell.</v>

853
00:35:11.281 --> 00:35:12.510
<v Speaker 4>Then back in Abu Dhabi,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

854
00:35:12.511 --> 00:35:17.511
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that guy's a fricken stronger and you </v>

855
00:35:17.511 --> 00:35:17.511
<v Speaker 4>think he is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then we're dudes like that,</v>

856
00:35:17.511 --> 00:35:17.511
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

857
00:35:17.511 --> 00:35:18.600
<v Speaker 4>He's just crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fricking strong.</v>

858
00:35:18.601 --> 00:35:20.870
<v Speaker 4>And so I'm guessing Anderson,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

859
00:35:20.890 --> 00:35:21.810
<v Speaker 4>ended up on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's like,</v>

860
00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:22.560
<v Speaker 4>cool,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

861
00:35:22.561 --> 00:35:24.660
<v Speaker 4>And all of a sudden it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>holy fuck,</v>

862
00:35:24.661 --> 00:35:29.661
<v Speaker 4>I can't get away shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think luder probably has some of </v>

863
00:35:29.661 --> 00:35:31.190
<v Speaker 4>that similar quality of being a lot </v>
<v Speaker 4>stronger than people really understand.</v>

864
00:35:31.210 --> 00:35:33.480
<v Speaker 4>I always liked travis from the get </v>
<v Speaker 4>because he was.</v>

865
00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:36.180
<v Speaker 4>He came from the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from the Jujitsu background,</v>

866
00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:37.810
<v Speaker 4>but everyone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a,</v>

867
00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:42.060
<v Speaker 4>he likes lego blocks exit and he trained</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the lines and dudes and always been a</v>

868
00:35:42.061 --> 00:35:43.860
<v Speaker 4>nice humble dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've always dug travis,</v>

869
00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:46.410
<v Speaker 2>speaking of leg locks for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for folks who don't know,</v>

870
00:35:46.411 --> 00:35:51.411
<v Speaker 2>for the longest time Jujitsu guys didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>go for leg locks because they thought </v>

871
00:35:51.411 --> 00:35:56.130
<v Speaker 2>that leg locks were who were cheating a </v>
<v Speaker 2>weak way to tap a guy.</v>

872
00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:57.750
<v Speaker 2>And one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what,</v>

873
00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:02.840
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what put that in their heads because </v>

874
00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:02.840
<v Speaker 2>it's like a train.</v>

875
00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:03.690
<v Speaker 4>Maybe you know why it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's just be honest,</v>

876
00:36:03.691 --> 00:36:05.730
<v Speaker 4>they said that because they didn't train</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

877
00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:11.040
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most of the training that was coming </v>

878
00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:11.550
<v Speaker 4>down throughout the rest of the Jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 4>tree was not including leg lots.</v>

879
00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:14.940
<v Speaker 4>A lake lots are not really given a lot </v>
<v Speaker 4>of precedent even if they were illegal.</v>

880
00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:19.080
<v Speaker 2>So they just ignored what made you </v>
<v Speaker 2>choose to do good in the first place was</v>

881
00:36:19.081 --> 00:36:19.830
<v Speaker 2>adapting.</v>

882
00:36:19.870 --> 00:36:21.010
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they just,</v>

883
00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:22.660
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they weren't good at that.</v>

884
00:36:22.661 --> 00:36:25.510
<v Speaker 4>Instead of accepting it and being like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

885
00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:28.060
<v Speaker 4>this is a weakness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just threw a fit about it,</v>

886
00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:33.200
<v Speaker 2>wasn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also because dudes are getting fucked </v>

887
00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:33.200
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially like heel hooks maybe,</v>

888
00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:33.640
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

889
00:36:33.650 --> 00:36:35.680
<v Speaker 2>you don't have much time to tap how many</v>
<v Speaker 2>times,</v>

890
00:36:35.681 --> 00:36:37.390
<v Speaker 2>especially people get their arms busted </v>
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>

891
00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:42.470
<v Speaker 2>It's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he'll hook seem to be even more </v>

892
00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:44.881
<v Speaker 2>devastating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems to me that you can snap your </v>

893
00:36:44.881 --> 00:36:46.600
<v Speaker 2>arm back and get it repaired better than</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can fuck your knee sideways</v>

894
00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:48.640
<v Speaker 4>potentially.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think maybe the difference between,</v>

895
00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:50.070
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the uh,</v>

896
00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:54.570
<v Speaker 4>vertical like type of a break versus </v>
<v Speaker 4>that twisting.</v>

897
00:36:55.370 --> 00:37:00.370
<v Speaker 4>Like if you had an arm and you twisted </v>
<v Speaker 4>it and smashed and tore up all the </v>

898
00:37:00.370 --> 00:37:00.370
<v Speaker 4>tendons instead of just going one </v>
<v Speaker 4>direction.</v>

899
00:37:00.370 --> 00:37:01.980
<v Speaker 4>Maybe that's part of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But also,</v>

900
00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:07.430
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a bit of a disconnect </v>

901
00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:07.430
<v Speaker 4>for people between their legs and their </v>
<v Speaker 4>arms.</v>

902
00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:07.430
<v Speaker 4>Like they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

903
00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:12.380
<v Speaker 4>they are more aware of their arm </v>
<v Speaker 4>position and how bad something is or </v>

904
00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:15.711
<v Speaker 4>isn't versus their legs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I'm sure some of that comes to </v>

905
00:37:15.711 --> 00:37:18.981
<v Speaker 4>the lack of training.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Eric won a Pan Am games that blue belt </v>

906
00:37:18.981 --> 00:37:20.670
<v Speaker 4>and blue belt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>purple something back in the day,</v>

907
00:37:20.671 --> 00:37:22.290
<v Speaker 4>way back in the day back when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

908
00:37:22.291 --> 00:37:24.090
<v Speaker 4>he probably road there in a horse and </v>
<v Speaker 4>carriage.</v>

909
00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:29.540
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he tapped a bunch of people with leg </v>

910
00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:30.030
<v Speaker 4>locks and the whole crowd booed him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that crazy?</v>

911
00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:35.200
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why I'm bringing this up is that it </v>

912
00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:37.020
<v Speaker 2>changed somewhere along the line they </v>
<v Speaker 2>had to give up and they all go after leg</v>

913
00:37:37.021 --> 00:37:38.130
<v Speaker 2>locks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

914
00:37:38.131 --> 00:37:41.110
<v Speaker 2>it's the most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's most hypocritical.</v>

915
00:37:41.111 --> 00:37:43.350
<v Speaker 2>Juarez is excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the best.</v>

916
00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:48.710
<v Speaker 2>He's just one of the scariest guys when </v>
<v Speaker 2>it comes to leg locks because he's a </v>

917
00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:50.350
<v Speaker 2>fucking ridiculously strong dude and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got good technique.</v>

918
00:37:50.351 --> 00:37:55.351
<v Speaker 2>So if he wraps a hold of that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're in a fucking terrible </v>

919
00:37:55.351 --> 00:37:55.351
<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>

920
00:37:55.351 --> 00:37:55.420
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like a,</v>

921
00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:58.030
<v Speaker 4>he's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

922
00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:03.060
<v Speaker 4>like a Solomon Grundy of it may just </v>
<v Speaker 4>getting in there and just trying to </v>

923
00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:03.060
<v Speaker 4>figure leg off.</v>

924
00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:03.710
<v Speaker 2>And.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And your,</v>

925
00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:06.140
<v Speaker 2>your best friend Hector Lombard went out</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

926
00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:07.520
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Actually,</v>

927
00:38:07.530 --> 00:38:12.530
<v Speaker 4>you know who's not bad at leg locks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hector Hector's very good at language </v>

928
00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:12.980
<v Speaker 4>factors.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good at actually hector's pretty good at</v>

929
00:38:12.981 --> 00:38:17.981
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He will only choose to use a piece of </v>

930
00:38:17.981 --> 00:38:20.981
<v Speaker 4>his arsenal for the most part.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's more of a mental thing </v>

931
00:38:20.981 --> 00:38:23.681
<v Speaker 4>than anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But hector actually has a ton of tools </v>

932
00:38:23.681 --> 00:38:23.681
<v Speaker 4>at his disposal.</v>

933
00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:25.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're very underrated ground game.</v>

934
00:38:25.930 --> 00:38:28.600
<v Speaker 2>If you watch that leg lock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a video of him competing,</v>

935
00:38:28.601 --> 00:38:33.601
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the Nogi grappling tournaments </v>

936
00:38:33.601 --> 00:38:35.050
<v Speaker 2>and he slaps a straight ankle lock in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy and breaks his leg and you hear</v>

937
00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:36.220
<v Speaker 2>crack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

938
00:38:36.221 --> 00:38:38.080
<v Speaker 2>and like you see that torque that he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>put in with that</v>

939
00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:42.710
<v Speaker 4>fireplug man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were talking about muscle ups.</v>

940
00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:48.260
<v Speaker 4>How do you do muscle?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Hector come eight man wasn't muscle </v>

941
00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:48.260
<v Speaker 4>up man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

942
00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:49.700
<v Speaker 4>well what you do did you do like this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he goes like this man,</v>

943
00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:55.860
<v Speaker 4>it also explained a muscle muscle up is </v>
<v Speaker 4>you grab a pull up bar and so you go and</v>

944
00:38:56.061 --> 00:38:58.970
<v Speaker 4>you go through the whole pull up motion </v>
<v Speaker 4>of pulling yourself chin over the bar.</v>

945
00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:04.180
<v Speaker 4>But once you get up to that point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you pull your body all the way over the </v>

946
00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:04.520
<v Speaker 4>top of the bar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now you're,</v>

947
00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:05.640
<v Speaker 4>you're a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

948
00:39:05.650 --> 00:39:08.780
<v Speaker 4>the bar is now at your waist and your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got your arms completely extended</v>

949
00:39:08.781 --> 00:39:10.520
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's ridiculously difficult.</v>

950
00:39:10.521 --> 00:39:11.950
<v Speaker 4>Hard thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

951
00:39:11.970 --> 00:39:14.930
<v Speaker 4>and hector wasn't doing it like kicking </v>
<v Speaker 4>his feet like a crazy fuck.</v>

952
00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:20.260
<v Speaker 4>He was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like George of the jungle fucking </v>

953
00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:20.690
<v Speaker 4>flinging himself around like this man.</v>

954
00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:23.510
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>

955
00:39:23.570 --> 00:39:28.570
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you didn't have to do 12 of them to </v>

956
00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:28.570
<v Speaker 4>prove it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you got to be 12.</v>

957
00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:31.810
<v Speaker 4>It's something like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he just fucking popped him out and he </v>

958
00:39:31.810 --> 00:39:31.810
<v Speaker 4>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do pull up all the time map mode,</v>

959
00:39:31.810 --> 00:39:31.810
<v Speaker 4>the digital,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the digital.</v>

960
00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:34.430
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ got that crazy judo </v>
<v Speaker 4>strength.</v>

961
00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:37.010
<v Speaker 4>He's got crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything is crazy.</v>

962
00:39:37.011 --> 00:39:38.960
<v Speaker 4>Genetics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Crazy mentality.</v>

963
00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:41.060
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well it's.</v>

964
00:39:41.061 --> 00:39:42.500
<v Speaker 4>When it works,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's fantastic.</v>

965
00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:44.270
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's an exciting guy to watch,</v>

966
00:39:44.271 --> 00:39:45.080
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That dude,</v>

967
00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:48.050
<v Speaker 4>he's got some fucking freak power in his</v>
<v Speaker 4>hands too.</v>

968
00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:49.400
<v Speaker 4>He can hit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's fast.</v>

969
00:39:49.401 --> 00:39:51.050
<v Speaker 4>He's very sharp.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a,</v>

970
00:39:51.110 --> 00:39:54.200
<v Speaker 4>he's more of a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's not a heavy puncher.</v>

971
00:39:54.201 --> 00:39:56.120
<v Speaker 4>And like that heavy flooding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a,</v>

972
00:39:56.121 --> 00:39:57.510
<v Speaker 4>he's a snapper.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

973
00:39:57.840 --> 00:39:58.030
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

974
00:39:58.450 --> 00:39:59.870
<v Speaker 2>Throws his hips into things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>

975
00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:03.310
<v Speaker 2>That's one thing about judo guys as well</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a wrestler guys,</v>

976
00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:08.400
<v Speaker 2>once they learn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like especially a wrestler has got a </v>

977
00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:10.741
<v Speaker 2>good power double once they learn how to</v>
<v Speaker 2>put that same effort and energy into a </v>

978
00:40:10.741 --> 00:40:14.641
<v Speaker 2>punch like you saw with Erin Simpson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Erin Simpson started putting people </v>

979
00:40:14.641 --> 00:40:14.920
<v Speaker 2>away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>learn to spring into his punches.</v>

980
00:40:14.921 --> 00:40:19.921
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once those guys really learn how to do </v>

981
00:40:19.921 --> 00:40:19.921
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Henderson,</v>

982
00:40:19.921 --> 00:40:21.490
<v Speaker 2>Rashad Evans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rashad Evans has gotten ridiculous right</v>

983
00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:21.740
<v Speaker 2>hand.</v>

984
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.460
<v Speaker 4>Rashad has tons more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tons and tons of power.</v>

985
00:40:24.461 --> 00:40:25.390
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's.</v>

986
00:40:25.391 --> 00:40:27.040
<v Speaker 4>Timing is terrible though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

987
00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:32.190
<v Speaker 4>He often whiffs tons of punches were I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think he's throwing without thinking </v>

988
00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:35.050
<v Speaker 4>instead of setting up that strike that </v>
<v Speaker 4>he's looking for instead,</v>

989
00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:36.670
<v Speaker 4>I think you don't think he's getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>better at that now.</v>

990
00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:40.000
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure there's improvement,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I still think that that is like,</v>

991
00:40:40.001 --> 00:40:43.630
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't lack speed at all super fast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't lack power.</v>

992
00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:44.030
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>

993
00:40:44.170 --> 00:40:46.090
<v Speaker 4>I remember watching the chuck flight </v>
<v Speaker 4>gets going,</v>

994
00:40:46.091 --> 00:40:51.091
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's getting tore apart in terms of </v>

995
00:40:51.091 --> 00:40:53.791
<v Speaker 4>timing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but chuck's hands are so down that and </v>

996
00:40:53.791 --> 00:40:53.791
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

997
00:40:53.791 --> 00:40:54.250
<v Speaker 4>that right handy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that right hook.</v>

998
00:40:54.251 --> 00:40:57.280
<v Speaker 4>He keeps throwing his,</v>
<v Speaker 4>got knockout all over,</v>

999
00:40:57.281 --> 00:40:58.750
<v Speaker 4>like you don't want to get touched by </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1000
00:40:58.751 --> 00:41:03.751
<v Speaker 4>And boom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he gets beat Clemson with it and chuck </v>

1001
00:41:03.751 --> 00:41:06.661
<v Speaker 4>goes out like a light or even he got on </v>
<v Speaker 4>top of forest and he threw just a punch </v>

1002
00:41:06.661 --> 00:41:08.200
<v Speaker 4>from down on top,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it had such snap on it.</v>

1003
00:41:08.410 --> 00:41:13.410
<v Speaker 4>Boom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tort a forest was out from there that </v>

1004
00:41:13.410 --> 00:41:14.980
<v Speaker 4>were shot of the chunk of Delphi.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There were shot that you saw against.</v>

1005
00:41:14.981 --> 00:41:15.950
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1006
00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:18.250
<v Speaker 4>who's this last fight?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1007
00:41:18.251 --> 00:41:23.251
<v Speaker 4>Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I wouldn't even know in his last </v>

1008
00:41:23.251 --> 00:41:23.251
<v Speaker 4>fight</v>

1009
00:41:23.251 --> 00:41:23.251
<v Speaker 2>are any fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1010
00:41:23.470 --> 00:41:24.160
<v Speaker 2>Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wonderful.</v>

1011
00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:24.560
<v Speaker 2>Denise.</v>

1012
00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:26.820
<v Speaker 4>Oh he did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But even still they're like,</v>

1013
00:41:26.821 --> 00:41:28.440
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's still not,</v>

1014
00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:31.140
<v Speaker 4>he's not really a timing's better,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he still like,</v>

1015
00:41:31.141 --> 00:41:34.140
<v Speaker 4>there's so many opportunities that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think he's a,</v>

1016
00:41:34.170 --> 00:41:37.920
<v Speaker 4>in terms of lining up good solid shots </v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

1017
00:41:38.010 --> 00:41:43.010
<v Speaker 4>and putting his opponents away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I still don't think he has as much </v>

1018
00:41:43.010 --> 00:41:46.880
<v Speaker 4>comfort and I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's not as at home on his feet as a </v>

1019
00:41:48.361 --> 00:41:49.560
<v Speaker 4>striker,</v>
<v Speaker 4>still as,</v>

1020
00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:52.290
<v Speaker 4>as perhaps as he could be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1021
00:41:52.291 --> 00:41:53.970
<v Speaker 4>he's been training with spong now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1022
00:41:53.971 --> 00:41:57.840
<v Speaker 4>those guys that done at the Blackzilians</v>
<v Speaker 4>with spong and with that Henry,</v>

1023
00:41:57.890 --> 00:42:01.110
<v Speaker 4>who's that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure those guys put them through pad</v>

1024
00:42:01.111 --> 00:42:03.200
<v Speaker 4>work and all the different because they </v>
<v Speaker 4>Davis Friday.</v>

1025
00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:06.360
<v Speaker 4>I thought that was like some of his best</v>
<v Speaker 4>striking one of his best fight.</v>

1026
00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:10.740
<v Speaker 4>I just think what it comes down to is </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not even necessarily the,</v>

1027
00:42:10.741 --> 00:42:11.810
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1028
00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:15.690
<v Speaker 4>the pad work he's doing or the technical</v>
<v Speaker 4>work or even just the flat out sparring.</v>

1029
00:42:15.690 --> 00:42:20.690
<v Speaker 4>I think it has to be a very engineered </v>
<v Speaker 4>drilling scenario to try and awakened </v>

1030
00:42:21.090 --> 00:42:24.540
<v Speaker 4>that potential in somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of times people they think,</v>

1031
00:42:24.541 --> 00:42:29.541
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need to get better on my feet so I'm </v>

1032
00:42:29.541 --> 00:42:29.670
<v Speaker 4>just going to spar more and spar harder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But actually what happens is,</v>

1033
00:42:29.671 --> 00:42:34.671
<v Speaker 4>is it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like the difference between doing </v>

1034
00:42:34.671 --> 00:42:35.380
<v Speaker 4>shoulders and doing your rotator cuffs </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're doing your shoulders.</v>

1035
00:42:35.381 --> 00:42:38.310
<v Speaker 4>Like every muscle group comes into play </v>
<v Speaker 4>and often you know,</v>

1036
00:42:38.311 --> 00:42:40.170
<v Speaker 4>things like the rotator cuffs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the weakest link,</v>

1037
00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:45.500
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to really draw upon </v>
<v Speaker 4>that because that's not made for </v>

1038
00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:45.500
<v Speaker 4>shoving,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1039
00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:45.500
<v Speaker 4>weight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>overhead,</v>

1040
00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:47.640
<v Speaker 4>big heavyweight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And and high stress loads,</v>

1041
00:42:47.790 --> 00:42:52.790
<v Speaker 4>so all of this other stuff is going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>compensate for your little muscles so </v>

1042
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:56.451
<v Speaker 4>they don't have to work nearly as hard </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you've got these big movers in </v>

1043
00:42:56.451 --> 00:42:56.451
<v Speaker 4>place,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1044
00:42:56.451 --> 00:42:56.580
<v Speaker 4>when you need to work your rotator </v>
<v Speaker 4>cuffs,</v>

1045
00:42:56.581 --> 00:43:00.390
<v Speaker 4>you have to use a small way on purpose </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you have to try and get all this</v>

1046
00:43:00.391 --> 00:43:05.391
<v Speaker 4>to shut down so that it doesn't come </v>
<v Speaker 4>into play and you can work just those </v>

1047
00:43:05.391 --> 00:43:09.471
<v Speaker 4>little tiny muscles that often get over </v>
<v Speaker 4>overlooked and over compensated by the </v>

1048
00:43:09.471 --> 00:43:13.821
<v Speaker 4>bigger muscle groups and that's how you </v>
<v Speaker 4>work your rotator cuffs and you don't </v>

1049
00:43:13.821 --> 00:43:14.010
<v Speaker 4>doing small weight because you're a </v>
<v Speaker 4>pussy.</v>

1050
00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:16.920
<v Speaker 4>If you got to do small weight because </v>
<v Speaker 4>otherwise you're not going to engage.</v>

1051
00:43:16.921 --> 00:43:19.980
<v Speaker 4>Those muscles and other muscles are </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to come in and take over,</v>

1052
00:43:20.190 --> 00:43:25.190
<v Speaker 4>which you don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're trying to work on something very </v>

1053
00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:25.190
<v Speaker 4>specific.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Same thing with standup work.</v>

1054
00:43:25.470 --> 00:43:28.980
<v Speaker 4>You can't go out there and just go </v>
<v Speaker 4>harder and go fast and go tougher.</v>

1055
00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:34.160
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes you've got to really dial that</v>
<v Speaker 4>shit way the hell back way slower and </v>

1056
00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:37.911
<v Speaker 4>just start putting yourself in two </v>
<v Speaker 4>different mindsets and start putting </v>

1057
00:43:38.341 --> 00:43:40.080
<v Speaker 4>yourself into a position where,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1058
00:43:40.081 --> 00:43:41.610
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what am I working on here?</v>

1059
00:43:41.611 --> 00:43:46.611
<v Speaker 4>I'm always retreating too much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like so maybe you cut up like a little </v>

1060
00:43:46.611 --> 00:43:49.881
<v Speaker 4>square and you've got to stay within it </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you got to move slow and light and </v>

1061
00:43:49.881 --> 00:43:53.631
<v Speaker 4>just get used to getting hit and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>rolling with the punches and you're </v>

1062
00:43:53.631 --> 00:43:54.990
<v Speaker 4>slipping and your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your head movement and because often you</v>

1063
00:43:54.991 --> 00:43:55.320
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1064
00:43:55.321 --> 00:43:57.720
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to work on my defense this </v>
<v Speaker 4>round and you're going hard.</v>

1065
00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:00.930
<v Speaker 4>You just get your head harder one </v>
<v Speaker 4>direction or the other.</v>

1066
00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:02.940
<v Speaker 4>Dip harder,</v>
<v Speaker 4>swing faster,</v>

1067
00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:08.240
<v Speaker 4>but you don't what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't realize that you're actually </v>

1068
00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:09.570
<v Speaker 4>overcompensating your technique by your </v>
<v Speaker 4>athleticism.</v>

1069
00:44:10.110 --> 00:44:11.230
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

1070
00:44:11.610 --> 00:44:16.610
<v Speaker 4>what you have to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you really want to work your </v>

1071
00:44:16.610 --> 00:44:16.610
<v Speaker 4>technique,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to scale it way the fuck back.</v>

1072
00:44:16.610 --> 00:44:20.630
<v Speaker 4>You gotta you gotta train the mind,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the eyes and the body all at the same </v>

1073
00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:20.630
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's different</v>

1074
00:44:20.830 --> 00:44:25.830
<v Speaker 2>in this approach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your approach is one of the reasons why </v>

1075
00:44:25.830 --> 00:44:26.350
<v Speaker 2>you're this many years in the game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

1076
00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:28.360
<v Speaker 2>I said I saw you fight way back in super</v>
<v Speaker 2>raw,</v>

1077
00:44:28.361 --> 00:44:30.190
<v Speaker 2>which was in the nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right when,</v>

1078
00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:30.340
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1079
00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:32.000
<v Speaker 4>You're going to make 99.</v>

1080
00:44:32.210 --> 00:44:34.620
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started my career in like a 96,</v>

1081
00:44:34.621 --> 00:44:35.860
<v Speaker 2>97,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this,</v>

1082
00:44:35.890 --> 00:44:40.450
<v Speaker 2>this approach to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this cerebral approach did this the only</v>

1083
00:44:40.451 --> 00:44:44.200
<v Speaker 2>way you stay this lucid but this many </v>
<v Speaker 2>years in the fight game.</v>

1084
00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:46.210
<v Speaker 2>But this is the only way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1085
00:44:46.211 --> 00:44:46.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean</v>

1086
00:44:47.150 --> 00:44:48.950
<v Speaker 4>much that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

1087
00:44:49.070 --> 00:44:54.070
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking people up bad so they can't </v>

1088
00:44:54.070 --> 00:44:54.130
<v Speaker 4>really do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

1089
00:44:54.170 --> 00:44:59.170
<v Speaker 4>back at Amc we used to do a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>flowing drills and things just weren't </v>

1090
00:44:59.630 --> 00:45:02.240
<v Speaker 4>all about killing each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean we had a lot of time killing each</v>

1091
00:45:02.241 --> 00:45:03.680
<v Speaker 4>other to trust me there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck,</v>

1092
00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:05.120
<v Speaker 4>you have to have both.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1093
00:45:05.121 --> 00:45:06.110
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

1094
00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:09.080
<v Speaker 4>we have a good balance and the problem </v>
<v Speaker 4>with especially like,</v>

1095
00:45:09.081 --> 00:45:14.081
<v Speaker 4>so I've got this reputation of not being</v>
<v Speaker 4>able to keep sparring partners and all </v>

1096
00:45:14.081 --> 00:45:14.081
<v Speaker 4>this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1097
00:45:14.081 --> 00:45:18.010
<v Speaker 4>because the problem is they come in </v>
<v Speaker 4>during fight training and they get </v>

1098
00:45:18.010 --> 00:45:20.180
<v Speaker 4>fucked up and I don't go to injure </v>
<v Speaker 4>anybody,</v>

1099
00:45:20.181 --> 00:45:21.500
<v Speaker 4>but you're damn right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I beat him up.</v>

1100
00:45:21.730 --> 00:45:24.040
<v Speaker 2>So are you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're doing flight training,</v>

1101
00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:26.390
<v Speaker 2>are you going full clip every sparring </v>
<v Speaker 2>session?</v>

1102
00:45:26.391 --> 00:45:27.550
<v Speaker 2>Do you go 70 percent?</v>

1103
00:45:27.570 --> 00:45:30.450
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>usually 80 to 80 to 90</v>

1104
00:45:30.650 --> 00:45:31.430
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that a.</v>

1105
00:45:31.431 --> 00:45:33.350
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a fascinating thing.</v>

1106
00:45:33.410 --> 00:45:38.410
<v Speaker 2>The idea of how to correctly prepare </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone for an mma fight and with you </v>

1107
00:45:40.341 --> 00:45:43.160
<v Speaker 2>it's got to be really difficult because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably not a lot of dudes.</v>

1108
00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:48.200
<v Speaker 2>You're going to take advice from that </v>
<v Speaker 2>know more than you at this stage of the </v>

1109
00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:52.601
<v Speaker 2>game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you're piecing together your </v>

1110
00:45:52.601 --> 00:45:55.691
<v Speaker 2>training programs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're piecing together your stand up </v>

1111
00:45:55.691 --> 00:45:57.380
<v Speaker 2>and you're grappling and how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you decide like how much time you</v>

1112
00:45:57.381 --> 00:45:59.480
<v Speaker 2>should put on this and how do you </v>
<v Speaker 2>engineer it?</v>

1113
00:46:00.010 --> 00:46:04.300
<v Speaker 4>It's a balance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to be very honest with yourself</v>

1114
00:46:04.301 --> 00:46:09.301
<v Speaker 4>on what's necessary and you can't just </v>
<v Speaker 4>sit back and have this pride and ego </v>

1115
00:46:09.301 --> 00:46:13.590
<v Speaker 4>step over what what is important towards</v>
<v Speaker 4>developing you're training and I've got </v>

1116
00:46:14.561 --> 00:46:17.890
<v Speaker 4>guys like Eric Paulson and there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>Paulson is a walking,</v>

1117
00:46:17.891 --> 00:46:20.270
<v Speaker 4>talking encyclopedia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking people up and.</v>

1118
00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:25.320
<v Speaker 4>But he also has the tendency to just </v>
<v Speaker 4>start pulling from everywhere sometimes </v>

1119
00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:25.420
<v Speaker 4>and so he'll throw in these techniques.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1120
00:46:25.421 --> 00:46:26.590
<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>

1121
00:46:26.591 --> 00:46:28.100
<v Speaker 4>I've never even done that in too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's.</v>

1122
00:46:28.150 --> 00:46:29.740
<v Speaker 4>I don't fucking really think that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>applicable,</v>

1123
00:46:30.010 --> 00:46:32.020
<v Speaker 4>but that's just how Paulson is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He'll hit you,</v>

1124
00:46:32.021 --> 00:46:32.620
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you say,</v>

1125
00:46:32.621 --> 00:46:33.610
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's do a,</v>

1126
00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:37.780
<v Speaker 4>let's work on some hand combos and he'll</v>
<v Speaker 4>throw a thousand of them that you.</v>

1127
00:46:38.350 --> 00:46:39.700
<v Speaker 4>And.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the thing is,</v>

1128
00:46:39.701 --> 00:46:42.820
<v Speaker 4>is that there is tons of valuable </v>
<v Speaker 4>information and tweaks.</v>

1129
00:46:42.821 --> 00:46:47.821
<v Speaker 4>It can be made.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to be smart enough and open </v>

1130
00:46:47.821 --> 00:46:47.821
<v Speaker 4>enough and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1131
00:46:47.821 --> 00:46:51.910
<v Speaker 4>and present enough in this type of </v>
<v Speaker 4>training to work with him to develop all</v>

1132
00:46:51.911 --> 00:46:52.420
<v Speaker 4>those skills.</v>

1133
00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:57.420
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have all kinds of tricks that I've </v>

1134
00:46:57.420 --> 00:46:57.420
<v Speaker 4>picked up from Paulson over the years </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are.</v>

1135
00:46:57.420 --> 00:47:00.280
<v Speaker 4>I know it wouldn't have gotten any place</v>
<v Speaker 4>else because people don't have that kind</v>

1136
00:47:00.281 --> 00:47:02.080
<v Speaker 4>of background martial background and </v>
<v Speaker 4>even,</v>

1137
00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:03.160
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1138
00:47:03.161 --> 00:47:06.430
<v Speaker 4>I've got specific coaches that what I do</v>
<v Speaker 4>is when I go on a train with them,</v>

1139
00:47:06.431 --> 00:47:11.431
<v Speaker 4>I really narrow it all down and I do </v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly what I'm there to do with them </v>

1140
00:47:11.431 --> 00:47:16.050
<v Speaker 4>and then when I'm done with it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then I have to assess all the data that </v>

1141
00:47:16.050 --> 00:47:20.401
<v Speaker 4>I got from that training session and how</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's going to apply to me in the ring </v>

1142
00:47:20.401 --> 00:47:22.270
<v Speaker 4>with my overall strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what works best,</v>

1143
00:47:22.271 --> 00:47:24.040
<v Speaker 4>where my natural tendencies are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>

1144
00:47:24.041 --> 00:47:27.370
<v Speaker 4>and under certain scenarios and just in </v>
<v Speaker 4>general and uh,</v>

1145
00:47:27.371 --> 00:47:32.371
<v Speaker 4>and how to best incorporate it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I'll go and I'll do a training </v>

1146
00:47:32.371 --> 00:47:33.480
<v Speaker 4>session.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Often I'll have a hill.</v>

1147
00:47:33.620 --> 00:47:38.620
<v Speaker 4>My coach Nixonian will have me doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>these six seven punchkick combos or </v>

1148
00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:41.380
<v Speaker 4>involve me spinning and hook kicking and</v>
<v Speaker 4>all this kind of stuff.</v>

1149
00:47:42.010 --> 00:47:44.770
<v Speaker 4>I'm never probably going to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 4>pull that off.</v>

1150
00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:46.450
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the ring.</v>

1151
00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:48.660
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that whole start to finish at the top of</v>

1152
00:47:48.670 --> 00:47:50.650
<v Speaker 4>the double kicks up top boom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>spend bank,</v>

1153
00:47:50.651 --> 00:47:51.250
<v Speaker 4>come back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>boom,</v>

1154
00:47:51.251 --> 00:47:51.580
<v Speaker 4>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>boom.</v>

1155
00:47:51.581 --> 00:47:56.581
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there are pieces that I could take </v>

1156
00:47:56.581 --> 00:47:59.161
<v Speaker 4>from that and use it in a combination or</v>
<v Speaker 4>use a setup to something else or set up </v>

1157
00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:01.750
<v Speaker 4>to a take down or is it counter?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1158
00:48:01.751 --> 00:48:04.570
<v Speaker 4>also just the ability to be more </v>
<v Speaker 4>dexterous,</v>

1159
00:48:04.571 --> 00:48:09.571
<v Speaker 4>more able,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more agile and just have better body </v>

1160
00:48:09.571 --> 00:48:09.571
<v Speaker 4>control and balance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1161
00:48:09.571 --> 00:48:14.550
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why GSP has been doing </v>

1162
00:48:14.550 --> 00:48:14.550
<v Speaker 4>gymnastics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fantastic.</v>

1163
00:48:14.550 --> 00:48:17.350
<v Speaker 4>If I wasn't a big son of a bitch who </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinks their arms just pull off,</v>

1164
00:48:17.351 --> 00:48:22.351
<v Speaker 4>I tried to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not to mention who's a deteriorated his </v>

1165
00:48:22.351 --> 00:48:24.700
<v Speaker 4>body with years and years of training </v>
<v Speaker 4>and whores and alcohol.</v>

1166
00:48:24.730 --> 00:48:26.210
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

1167
00:48:26.290 --> 00:48:30.260
<v Speaker 4>maybe I would do more in gymnastics </v>
<v Speaker 4>other than bedroom.</v>

1168
00:48:30.261 --> 00:48:31.450
<v Speaker 4>Gymnastics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

00:48:31.451 --> 00:48:34.390
<v Speaker 4>My leg doesn't go there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You shouldn't try either.</v>

1170
00:48:34.930 --> 00:48:38.120
<v Speaker 4>You can't even do rubber guard pulling </v>
<v Speaker 4>any kind of ironic.</v>

1171
00:48:38.170 --> 00:48:39.320
<v Speaker 4>Not really a</v>

1172
00:48:39.710 --> 00:48:40.700
<v Speaker 2>so don't know the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1173
00:48:40.701 --> 00:48:45.701
<v Speaker 2>you're a leg lock master.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've known for your leg locks but it </v>

1174
00:48:45.701 --> 00:48:45.701
<v Speaker 2>needs are all fucked.</v>

1175
00:48:45.701 --> 00:48:47.080
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean knees,</v>

1176
00:48:47.081 --> 00:48:47.800
<v Speaker 4>ankles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all.</v>

1177
00:48:47.801 --> 00:48:50.070
<v Speaker 4>I mean everything takes the price.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

1178
00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:50.840
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1179
00:48:50.841 --> 00:48:52.810
<v Speaker 4>I can't do rubber guard especially.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just not,</v>

1180
00:48:53.190 --> 00:48:55.010
<v Speaker 4>don't have that kind of flexibility that</v>
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>

1181
00:48:55.011 --> 00:48:55.600
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>

1182
00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:57.130
<v Speaker 4>I understand how it works,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1183
00:48:57.131 --> 00:49:02.131
<v Speaker 4>I mean I can do pieces of it and I can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can get down there with someone like </v>

1184
00:49:02.131 --> 00:49:06.060
<v Speaker 4>Victor Webster or a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a role for any of those dudes from 10th </v>

1185
00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:06.060
<v Speaker 4>planet and go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1186
00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:08.650
<v Speaker 4>well while you're working this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your angle is off here.</v>

1187
00:49:08.651 --> 00:49:10.390
<v Speaker 4>You need to apply your pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There you this,</v>

1188
00:49:10.420 --> 00:49:10.960
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1189
00:49:10.990 --> 00:49:12.150
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

1190
00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:15.700
<v Speaker 4>I'll do stuff if I'm at Eddie's just </v>
<v Speaker 4>rolling with vic and those dudes.</v>

1191
00:49:15.730 --> 00:49:18.040
<v Speaker 4>I'll throw rubber guard type shit on </v>
<v Speaker 4>Vic.</v>

1192
00:49:18.041 --> 00:49:23.041
<v Speaker 4>Best,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my best approximation and sometimes I </v>

1193
00:49:23.041 --> 00:49:23.380
<v Speaker 4>come up with some pretty clever stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Somebody asked me,</v>

1194
00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:25.120
<v Speaker 4>why are all these fighters getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>injured?</v>

1195
00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:30.140
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These fighters getting engine pulling </v>

1196
00:49:30.140 --> 00:49:30.140
<v Speaker 2>out of fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1197
00:49:30.140 --> 00:49:31.110
<v Speaker 2>because they're doing a sport where the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole key to the sport,</v>

1198
00:49:31.130 --> 00:49:34.020
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the end game is breaking people's bodies</v>

1199
00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:35.940
<v Speaker 2>and then the practicing it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1200
00:49:36.210 --> 00:49:41.210
<v Speaker 2>How do you intelligently approach it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you get through all the training but </v>

1201
00:49:41.611 --> 00:49:44.850
<v Speaker 2>with as little injury to your body as </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>

1202
00:49:44.851 --> 00:49:47.580
<v Speaker 2>Do you engineer that or you just roll </v>
<v Speaker 2>the dice?</v>

1203
00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:47.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1204
00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:49.850
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a little of both.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1205
00:49:49.851 --> 00:49:53.450
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of a factors that you just</v>
<v Speaker 4>can't account for,</v>

1206
00:49:53.470 --> 00:49:54.290
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody,</v>

1207
00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:57.830
<v Speaker 4>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody just rolls into your leg,</v>

1208
00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:01.160
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nuts that's been coming up a lot lately.</v>

1209
00:50:01.161 --> 00:50:04.070
<v Speaker 2>And Dana talked about it that Rashad </v>
<v Speaker 2>Evans had to pull out of a fight.</v>

1210
00:50:04.071 --> 00:50:09.071
<v Speaker 2>The actual fight where Shogun lost the </v>
<v Speaker 2>title to Jon Jones shot was supposed to </v>

1211
00:50:09.381 --> 00:50:14.381
<v Speaker 2>fight Shogun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Diego Sanchez was wrestling with </v>

1212
00:50:14.381 --> 00:50:16.840
<v Speaker 2>some dude and accidentally see that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just a lot easier.</v>

1213
00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:20.520
<v Speaker 2>That's near each other.</v>

1214
00:50:20.650 --> 00:50:21.450
<v Speaker 4>No they shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1215
00:50:21.470 --> 00:50:25.840
<v Speaker 4>and one thing that I got from Japan and </v>
<v Speaker 4>just always made total sense to me at,</v>

1216
00:50:25.841 --> 00:50:28.620
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at AACC A,</v>

1217
00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:31.150
<v Speaker 4>our bay and we were going to be Fuji is </v>
<v Speaker 4>Jim.</v>

1218
00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:35.810
<v Speaker 4>The other people that aren't wrestling </v>
<v Speaker 4>stand in between all the other folks and</v>

1219
00:50:35.811 --> 00:50:40.811
<v Speaker 4>keep them from running into each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We do that attend planet 10 flat does </v>

1220
00:50:40.811 --> 00:50:40.811
<v Speaker 4>that happened to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's a,</v>

1221
00:50:40.811 --> 00:50:42.470
<v Speaker 4>that's a nice thing if you could just </v>
<v Speaker 4>come on,</v>

1222
00:50:42.471 --> 00:50:44.570
<v Speaker 4>you got to be smart with your training.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And sometimes like,</v>

1223
00:50:44.571 --> 00:50:46.040
<v Speaker 4>hey look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at this fighter.</v>

1224
00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:49.690
<v Speaker 4>He is completely beat down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wore out and,</v>

1225
00:50:49.691 --> 00:50:50.630
<v Speaker 4>and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1226
00:50:50.631 --> 00:50:53.090
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can try and get him to mentally push</v>

1227
00:50:53.091 --> 00:50:55.250
<v Speaker 4>through all this kind of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but guess what?</v>

1228
00:50:55.280 --> 00:51:00.280
<v Speaker 4>That muscle fatigue is there and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's right to be injured right now to </v>

1229
00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:00.280
<v Speaker 4>change training.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1230
00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:00.920
<v Speaker 4>change your training.</v>

1231
00:51:01.090 --> 00:51:06.090
<v Speaker 2>That's where intelligence comes in and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what people don't understand </v>

1232
00:51:06.090 --> 00:51:06.850
<v Speaker 2>about mma is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1233
00:51:06.900 --> 00:51:11.900
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had people like write these really </v>

1234
00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:11.900
<v Speaker 2>stupid things that are just knee jerk </v>
<v Speaker 2>reaction.</v>

1235
00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:16.830
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these brain dead knee jerk reactions to </v>

1236
00:51:16.830 --> 00:51:16.930
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet you've seen this,</v>

1237
00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:22.190
<v Speaker 2>you've seen this amongst people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you really break it down in,</v>

1238
00:51:23.170 --> 00:51:27.010
<v Speaker 2>in order to really be at a high level </v>
<v Speaker 2>and compete in mma,</v>

1239
00:51:27.230 --> 00:51:30.940
<v Speaker 2>you are managing a lot of shit mentally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>emotionally,</v>

1240
00:51:30.941 --> 00:51:33.310
<v Speaker 2>physically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and on top of that,</v>

1241
00:51:33.490 --> 00:51:38.490
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to piece together the game</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the most consequences of any other </v>

1242
00:51:38.490 --> 00:51:41.440
<v Speaker 2>game that the game of fucking people up </v>
<v Speaker 2>or getting fucked up.</v>

1243
00:51:41.450 --> 00:51:43.540
<v Speaker 2>There's the most consequences </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotionally.</v>

1244
00:51:43.541 --> 00:51:48.541
<v Speaker 2>Most consequences physically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anybody who thinks losing a basketball </v>

1245
00:51:48.541 --> 00:51:49.820
<v Speaker 2>game as hard as you could go out.</v>

1246
00:51:49.890 --> 00:51:50.840
<v Speaker 4>They're in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1247
00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:52.920
<v Speaker 4>going out and as a team losing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1248
00:51:52.950 --> 00:51:56.070
<v Speaker 4>let's say the NBA championships sucks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean,</v>

1249
00:51:56.430 --> 00:52:01.430
<v Speaker 4>but it really is only a real </v>
<v Speaker 4>motherfucker if you have the game </v>

1250
00:52:01.430 --> 00:52:02.970
<v Speaker 4>winning shot and you were actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>inside the,</v>

1251
00:52:02.971 --> 00:52:05.220
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the key and you throw it up and you blew</v>

1252
00:52:05.221 --> 00:52:08.910
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now that is way that's really painful.</v>

1253
00:52:09.530 --> 00:52:12.420
<v Speaker 4>That flows,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's as close as you can get.</v>

1254
00:52:12.421 --> 00:52:17.421
<v Speaker 4>That kind of thing to being a fighter </v>
<v Speaker 4>and losing a major fight on national,</v>

1255
00:52:19.290 --> 00:52:21.560
<v Speaker 4>worldwide television.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's.</v>

1256
00:52:21.810 --> 00:52:25.320
<v Speaker 4>And even still,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it has to be the championship.</v>

1257
00:52:25.350 --> 00:52:28.650
<v Speaker 4>You have to lose the APP,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that entire championship to do that.</v>

1258
00:52:28.651 --> 00:52:31.980
<v Speaker 4>And here's the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the thing that also why it doesn't quite</v>

1259
00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:33.960
<v Speaker 4>get to that point for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for that per,</v>

1260
00:52:33.961 --> 00:52:38.961
<v Speaker 4>that basketball player versus the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fighter because next year you get </v>

1261
00:52:38.961 --> 00:52:40.170
<v Speaker 4>another chance to just do it all over </v>
<v Speaker 4>again.</v>

1262
00:52:40.530 --> 00:52:42.680
<v Speaker 4>And while you may have blown it and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>whole city is like,</v>

1263
00:52:42.690 --> 00:52:43.800
<v Speaker 4>fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you suck,</v>

1264
00:52:43.801 --> 00:52:44.900
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>

1265
00:52:44.901 --> 00:52:45.540
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blah.</v>

1266
00:52:46.110 --> 00:52:48.500
<v Speaker 4>No one kicked your ass at the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

1267
00:52:48.510 --> 00:52:53.510
<v Speaker 4>So now you go and you compound the fact </v>
<v Speaker 4>that not only did you just do something </v>

1268
00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:57.470
<v Speaker 4>you had at all the cards,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you had all everything in front of you </v>

1269
00:52:57.470 --> 00:53:00.051
<v Speaker 4>and this was your chance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not only did you blow it in front of </v>

1270
00:53:00.051 --> 00:53:02.691
<v Speaker 4>everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but somebody beat your ass to make you </v>

1271
00:53:02.691 --> 00:53:05.211
<v Speaker 4>blow it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You didn't just go out there and fuck </v>

1272
00:53:05.211 --> 00:53:05.211
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1273
00:53:05.211 --> 00:53:06.510
<v Speaker 4>you got fucked up and you lost.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have the mental management</v>

1274
00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:10.460
<v Speaker 2>of all these different things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The physical task of actually fighting,</v>

1275
00:53:10.461 --> 00:53:15.461
<v Speaker 2>controlling your energy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>knowing how to pace yourself on top of </v>

1276
00:53:15.461 --> 00:53:19.121
<v Speaker 2>knowing what to execute and there's so </v>
<v Speaker 2>many dimensions to execution as opposed </v>

1277
00:53:19.121 --> 00:53:24.071
<v Speaker 2>to like a standard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a basketball game or a boxing </v>

1278
00:53:24.071 --> 00:53:24.071
<v Speaker 2>match.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The dimensions.</v>

1279
00:53:24.071 --> 00:53:25.780
<v Speaker 2>I have so many messages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fourth dimension,</v>

1280
00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:28.150
<v Speaker 2>like my third eye,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my brown eye.</v>

1281
00:53:28.210 --> 00:53:30.220
<v Speaker 2>When you're adding in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like how many?</v>

1282
00:53:30.221 --> 00:53:35.221
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've watched a cro cop today versus </v>

1283
00:53:35.221 --> 00:53:35.221
<v Speaker 2>random and we were watching best of </v>
<v Speaker 2>pride.</v>

1284
00:53:35.221 --> 00:53:38.950
<v Speaker 2>I was going off on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did the fucking best of pride today was </v>

1285
00:53:38.950 --> 00:53:42.271
<v Speaker 2>insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a Dan Henderson's a second fight </v>

1286
00:53:42.271 --> 00:53:42.340
<v Speaker 2>with vandelay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like one of the greatest fights</v>

1287
00:53:42.341 --> 00:53:43.570
<v Speaker 2>of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was awesome.</v>

1288
00:53:43.571 --> 00:53:47.800
<v Speaker 2>And then they showed cro cop getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>knocked out by random in and I was like,</v>

1289
00:53:47.801 --> 00:53:52.801
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is where that wrestling dimension </v>

1290
00:53:52.801 --> 00:53:56.491
<v Speaker 2>really falls into place because cro cop </v>
<v Speaker 2>is so worried about that takedown that </v>

1291
00:53:56.491 --> 00:54:01.351
<v Speaker 2>he gets clipped with a big punch right </v>
<v Speaker 2>where he probably would not have gotten </v>

1292
00:54:01.351 --> 00:54:01.510
<v Speaker 2>clip with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just a standard standup.</v>

1293
00:54:01.540 --> 00:54:06.540
<v Speaker 2>Like exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just makes it all so random or </v>

1294
00:54:06.540 --> 00:54:06.540
<v Speaker 2>engaging the fake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he came up with new.</v>

1295
00:54:06.540 --> 00:54:07.990
<v Speaker 2>The kick was coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's when he threw the punch.</v>

1296
00:54:08.020 --> 00:54:13.020
<v Speaker 2>There's so much intelligence and </v>
<v Speaker 2>strategy and consequence and it's like </v>

1297
00:54:13.090 --> 00:54:18.090
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's such a highly charged game that </v>

1298
00:54:18.090 --> 00:54:20.671
<v Speaker 2>when people like say things about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a bunch of braindead Mongoloid is </v>

1299
00:54:20.671 --> 00:54:22.840
<v Speaker 2>beating the shit out of each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like sand some.</v>

1300
00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:25.040
<v Speaker 2>But it's such a silly point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

1301
00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:27.150
<v Speaker 2>It says that it's just</v>

1302
00:54:27.340 --> 00:54:29.530
<v Speaker 4>anytime,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I read something,</v>

1303
00:54:29.531 --> 00:54:30.810
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this,</v>

1304
00:54:30.811 --> 00:54:32.740
<v Speaker 4>this really got to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a,</v>

1305
00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:37.880
<v Speaker 4>an article on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's this new thing on vice called </v>

1306
00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:37.880
<v Speaker 4>fight land.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1307
00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:38.500
<v Speaker 4>And one of the guys on there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1308
00:54:38.530 --> 00:54:41.170
<v Speaker 4>likes to interview musicians about what </v>
<v Speaker 4>were their fight music b,</v>

1309
00:54:41.590 --> 00:54:45.070
<v Speaker 4>and he interviewed some guy that's like </v>
<v Speaker 4>a producer or something and the guy just</v>

1310
00:54:45.460 --> 00:54:50.460
<v Speaker 4>essentially just spewed vitriol about </v>
<v Speaker 4>how stupid fighting isn't fighting is </v>

1311
00:54:50.460 --> 00:54:52.600
<v Speaker 4>dumb and that's what idiots do and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what we've regressed with.</v>

1312
00:54:52.601 --> 00:54:54.430
<v Speaker 4>That's a regression.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We progress past that,</v>

1313
00:54:54.460 --> 00:54:59.460
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the uncultured and the society is </v>

1314
00:54:59.460 --> 00:54:59.460
<v Speaker 4>unlike.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what animals do.</v>

1315
00:54:59.460 --> 00:55:02.010
<v Speaker 4>Animals and babies fight and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck you,</v>

1316
00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:07.160
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry that you're a lopsided </v>

1317
00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:07.160
<v Speaker 4>individual and that you actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the physicality,</v>

1318
00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:11.670
<v Speaker 4>the physical part of your brain and your</v>
<v Speaker 4>body are basically defunct and you've </v>

1319
00:55:11.670 --> 00:55:15.991
<v Speaker 4>thrown that away and you think that </v>
<v Speaker 4>somehow that makes you a superior human </v>

1320
00:55:15.991 --> 00:55:15.991
<v Speaker 4>being because actually what it makes </v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1321
00:55:15.991 --> 00:55:16.750
<v Speaker 4>it makes you a defect.</v>

1322
00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:22.080
<v Speaker 4>You're the kind of thing that I don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>want to be out there breeding to make a </v>

1323
00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:23.200
<v Speaker 4>better human race because you're not </v>
<v Speaker 4>gunna.</v>

1324
00:55:23.230 --> 00:55:28.230
<v Speaker 4>Because you've decided to throw away a </v>
<v Speaker 4>part of it is as essential as a human </v>

1325
00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:30.670
<v Speaker 4>being and fighting doesn't have to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>angry,</v>

1326
00:55:30.671 --> 00:55:32.620
<v Speaker 4>violent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>animalistic,</v>

1327
00:55:32.621 --> 00:55:35.440
<v Speaker 4>just to dogs and cats going at it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1328
00:55:35.441 --> 00:55:36.720
<v Speaker 4>that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It has,</v>

1329
00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:41.500
<v Speaker 4>it can be so much more than that and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't in any physical endeavor is more</v>

1330
00:55:41.501 --> 00:55:44.440
<v Speaker 4>than that and can be more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it was just such a Shitty,</v>

1331
00:55:44.441 --> 00:55:46.950
<v Speaker 4>narrow point of view that I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1332
00:55:47.020 --> 00:55:50.290
<v Speaker 4>for someone who supposed to be so </v>
<v Speaker 4>educated to say such a thing,</v>

1333
00:55:50.291 --> 00:55:52.000
<v Speaker 4>like it really got under my fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>skin,</v>

1334
00:55:52.001 --> 00:55:53.220
<v Speaker 4>like mad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like maybe</v>

1335
00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:58.720
<v Speaker 2>up on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I just thought it was ridiculous to </v>

1336
00:55:59.331 --> 00:56:00.110
<v Speaker 2>say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1337
00:56:00.130 --> 00:56:05.130
<v Speaker 2>I've been in the presence of people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>have called me an idiot for doing </v>

1338
00:56:05.130 --> 00:56:05.840
<v Speaker 2>martial arts or even working out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1339
00:56:05.841 --> 00:56:06.740
<v Speaker 2>I've had like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1340
00:56:06.741 --> 00:56:11.741
<v Speaker 2>the people mock that you take care of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your body and it's just a defense </v>

1341
00:56:11.741 --> 00:56:12.350
<v Speaker 2>mechanism because they're smoking </v>
<v Speaker 2>cigarettes.</v>

1342
00:56:12.351 --> 00:56:13.910
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know they're rotting themselves</v>
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>

1343
00:56:14.060 --> 00:56:19.060
<v Speaker 2>And so there's some weird justification </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's like an intellectual </v>

1344
00:56:19.401 --> 00:56:22.310
<v Speaker 2>argument for the finite lifespan of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>human being and why.</v>

1345
00:56:22.311 --> 00:56:24.470
<v Speaker 2>Fuck with it anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why even worry about it?</v>

1346
00:56:24.471 --> 00:56:29.471
<v Speaker 2>What do you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you do when you're trying to </v>

1347
00:56:29.471 --> 00:56:29.471
<v Speaker 2>stay alive forever?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing?</v>

1348
00:56:29.471 --> 00:56:29.510
<v Speaker 2>Eating Greens and taking your vitamins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What have you taken?</v>

1349
00:56:29.511 --> 00:56:34.511
<v Speaker 2>Steroids?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you trying to live forever and </v>

1350
00:56:34.511 --> 00:56:36.470
<v Speaker 2>you know that that attitude of they </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't be bothered with exercise like,</v>

1351
00:56:36.650 --> 00:56:38.480
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is one of the dumbest things you're</v>

1352
00:56:38.481 --> 00:56:39.860
<v Speaker 2>telling me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're an intelligent person.</v>

1353
00:56:39.870 --> 00:56:44.870
<v Speaker 2>You want me to respect your opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have these cynical points of views </v>

1354
00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:47.621
<v Speaker 2>on things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yet you're not taking care of your </v>

1355
00:56:47.621 --> 00:56:47.621
<v Speaker 2>meat vehicle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1356
00:56:47.621 --> 00:56:47.621
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you retarded?</v>

1357
00:56:47.621 --> 00:56:49.520
<v Speaker 4>The thing that holds the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the computer.</v>

1358
00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:54.560
<v Speaker 4>Then all this I suppose,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and intelligence and wisdom and and all </v>

1359
00:56:54.560 --> 00:56:56.420
<v Speaker 4>of the filter that you have to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything in the spew out.</v>

1360
00:56:56.421 --> 00:57:00.500
<v Speaker 4>Anything that you experienced in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world exists within this.</v>

1361
00:57:00.501 --> 00:57:03.380
<v Speaker 4>You don't just drive a car into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking ground and throw it away.</v>

1362
00:57:03.460 --> 00:57:04.360
<v Speaker 2>It's dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1363
00:57:04.450 --> 00:57:06.430
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if your car works,</v>

1364
00:57:06.670 --> 00:57:08.020
<v Speaker 2>take care of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1365
00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:13.080
<v Speaker 2>Change the oil stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you deal with people that </v>

1366
00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:14.500
<v Speaker 2>somehow or another words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hilarious.</v>

1367
00:57:14.530 --> 00:57:17.740
<v Speaker 2>That is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like a whole section of humanity</v>

1368
00:57:17.890 --> 00:57:20.920
<v Speaker 2>that thinks that for some reason that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1369
00:57:21.010 --> 00:57:26.010
<v Speaker 2>by issuing anything physical and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sweating and that they are a superior </v>

1370
00:57:26.441 --> 00:57:29.110
<v Speaker 2>intellect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the judge,</v>

1371
00:57:29.410 --> 00:57:34.410
<v Speaker 2>a person like yourself or anybody who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing something physical as being an </v>

1372
00:57:34.410 --> 00:57:38.701
<v Speaker 2>inferior intellect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you almost automatically get </v>

1373
00:57:38.701 --> 00:57:38.701
<v Speaker 2>categorized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>that's great.</v>

1379
00:57:43.751 --> 00:57:48.751
<v Speaker 4>I can't wait.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm glad that you can push a broom </v>

1380
00:57:48.751 --> 00:57:48.751
<v Speaker 4>better than somebody else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now it's like no asshole.</v>

1381
00:57:48.751 --> 00:57:49.690
<v Speaker 4>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Got nothing to do with that.</v>

1385
00:57:57.800 --> 00:57:59.650
<v Speaker 4>their head around what it must've been </v>
<v Speaker 4>like to be in.</v>

1392
00:58:16.750 --> 00:58:18.730
<v Speaker 4>I wish I could have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was Bob's coach.</v>

1393
00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:23.760
<v Speaker 4>I walked out and then I got into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>center of the ring called out Nogueira </v>

1394
00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:27.091
<v Speaker 4>after beating bombed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's the biggest crowd that you ever </v>

1395
00:58:27.091 --> 00:58:27.091
<v Speaker 4>had?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was it 50,000</v>

1396
00:58:27.091 --> 00:58:30.250
<v Speaker 4>at the Tokyo Dome when I fought a shaky </v>
<v Speaker 4>Takahashi defending the king of pancreas</v>

1397
00:58:30.260 --> 00:58:33.370
<v Speaker 4>belt for new Japan pro wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ultimate crushed too.</v>

1398
00:58:33.780 --> 00:58:36.600
<v Speaker 2>I was 55,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was 60,000</v>

1399
00:58:36.630 --> 00:58:41.630
<v Speaker 2>Andrea Rogers Centre in Toronto for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>George St Pierre and Jake Shields and </v>

1400
00:58:42.331 --> 00:58:43.200
<v Speaker 2>that was insane.</v>

1401
00:58:43.420 --> 00:58:46.630
<v Speaker 4>It's nuts and I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean also to add to.</v>

1402
00:58:46.631 --> 00:58:48.820
<v Speaker 4>I fought in front of like 50,</v>
<v Speaker 4>55,000</v>

1403
00:58:48.821 --> 00:58:53.500
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I fought on the same car where a Leo toe</v>

1404
00:58:53.530 --> 00:58:55.960
<v Speaker 4>made his uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his debut.</v>

1405
00:58:56.110 --> 00:59:01.110
<v Speaker 4>So I knew that kid when we all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the only way we could converse was </v>

1406
00:59:01.110 --> 00:59:05.070
<v Speaker 4>through Japanese because he didn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>really speak English at the time and I </v>

1407
00:59:05.070 --> 00:59:06.520
<v Speaker 4>didn't speak any Portuguese.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then that card why fought,</v>

1408
00:59:06.970 --> 00:59:09.010
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>50 in front of 50,000</v>

1409
00:59:09.011 --> 00:59:12.400
<v Speaker 4>plus I've fought on the same car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That whole cogan wrestled on</v>

1410
00:59:13.700 --> 00:59:16.040
<v Speaker 2>mix it up with pro wrestling as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1411
00:59:16.150 --> 00:59:17.800
<v Speaker 2>That was a big thing in Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1412
00:59:17.801 --> 00:59:18.640
<v Speaker 2>Like they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would,</v>

1413
00:59:18.670 --> 00:59:23.670
<v Speaker 2>they would mix in pro wrestling and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would also have pro wrestlers who </v>

1414
00:59:23.670 --> 00:59:25.310
<v Speaker 2>would fight shoots,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would fight real mma fight.</v>

1415
00:59:25.320 --> 00:59:27.010
<v Speaker 4>There was a real,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1416
00:59:27.290 --> 00:59:30.560
<v Speaker 4>want to try and bridge that gap again </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

1417
00:59:30.570 --> 00:59:33.410
<v Speaker 4>what it takes the right individual and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it takes the right kind of planning.</v>

1418
00:59:33.411 --> 00:59:38.411
<v Speaker 4>There wasn't really a good amount of </v>
<v Speaker 4>planning put behind getting those </v>

1419
00:59:38.411 --> 00:59:39.350
<v Speaker 4>wrestlers prepared to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were just really,</v>

1420
00:59:39.351 --> 00:59:43.040
<v Speaker 4>a lot of them were just shoved into </v>
<v Speaker 4>these scenarios where Yakuza no,</v>

1421
00:59:43.070 --> 00:59:45.170
<v Speaker 4>just by,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're just my Japanese,</v>

1422
00:59:45.550 --> 00:59:47.810
<v Speaker 4>a bureaucracy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Politics as it is,</v>

1423
00:59:47.811 --> 00:59:48.170
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1424
00:59:48.171 --> 00:59:50.930
<v Speaker 4>this is your shot is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is your boss or whatever.</v>

1425
00:59:50.931 --> 00:59:55.931

<v Speaker 4>go do this and you really gotTa fucking </v>

1426
00:59:55.931 --> 00:59:55.931
<v Speaker 4>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's just the way it goes.</v>

1427
00:59:55.931 --> 00:59:58.910
<v Speaker 2>If you're a big time pro wrestler to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Takata and your,</v>

1428
00:59:58.911 --> 01:00:01.240

1431
01:00:08.110 --> 01:00:10.761
<v Speaker 2>fishy fights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the forum with Coleman that was </v>

1432
01:00:10.761 --> 01:00:11.280
<v Speaker 2>fishy as Coleman is a goddamn terrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>actor.</v>

1433

<v Speaker 2>I love Mark Coleman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love the hammer.</v>

1434
01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:16.240

<v Speaker 2>He's important due to hang out with </v>

1437

<v Speaker 2>Lundbeck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tell him he's got amazing stories for </v>

1438

<v Speaker 2>days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's great to work with.</v>

1439
01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:30.860
<v Speaker 2>He's a good dude too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hung out with him when he was the </v>

1440
01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:30.870
<v Speaker 2>champ in Augusta,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Georgia.</v>

1441
01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:31.710
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1442
01:00:31.711 --> 01:00:33.840
<v Speaker 2>We went to this crazy club that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1443
01:00:33.841 --> 01:00:35.460
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't like a house,</v>

1444
01:00:35.461 --> 01:00:37.140
<v Speaker 2>like someone had turned the house into a</v>
<v Speaker 2>club.</v>

1445
01:00:37.141 --> 01:00:38.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a mess about,</v>

1446
01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:39.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1447
01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:42.060
<v Speaker 2>it was like in the nineties when he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>the champ.</v>

1448
01:00:42.290 --> 01:00:47.290
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The godfather of ground and pound love </v>

1449
01:00:47.290 --> 01:00:50.631
<v Speaker 2>Coleman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But his fight with Dakota was clearly </v>

1450
01:00:50.631 --> 01:00:50.631
<v Speaker 2>fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so.</v>

1451
01:00:50.631 --> 01:00:50.631
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's an example.</v>

1452
01:00:50.631 --> 01:00:51.090
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

1453
01:00:51.091 --> 01:00:52.570
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1454
01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:56.850
<v Speaker 4>I find a Gnocchi bond by 2003,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think</v>

1455
01:00:56.850 --> 01:01:01.850
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand what we're talking </v>

1456
01:01:01.850 --> 01:01:01.850
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about fixed fights.</v>

1457
01:01:01.850 --> 01:01:05.530
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a few fights where they had </v>

1458
01:01:05.530 --> 01:01:07.551
<v Speaker 2>predetermined outcomes because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted these big Japanese Superhero </v>

1459
01:01:07.551 --> 01:01:07.551
<v Speaker 2>dudes to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to win.</v>

1460
01:01:07.551 --> 01:01:08.880
<v Speaker 2>And there was a couple of them that were</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of obvious.</v>

1461
01:01:09.060 --> 01:01:09.630
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1462
01:01:09.631 --> 01:01:14.631
<v Speaker 4>I'm fine finding this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an Okie Bombay card and Kobe stadium </v>

1463
01:01:14.631 --> 01:01:16.400
<v Speaker 4>that was a combination card because this</v>
<v Speaker 4>card was all filed,</v>

1464
01:01:16.410 --> 01:01:18.720
<v Speaker 4>eliminate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This one was all fights and uh,</v>

1465
01:01:18.721 --> 01:01:23.721
<v Speaker 4>I fought some shield night,</v>
<v Speaker 4>defended the king of pancrase title </v>

1466
01:01:23.721 --> 01:01:24.720
<v Speaker 4>against who is the former king of </v>
<v Speaker 4>pancreas guy before me.</v>

1467
01:01:24.721 --> 01:01:25.260
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1468
01:01:25.470 --> 01:01:30.470
<v Speaker 4>so it was a rematch against semi and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on that same card as my friend,</v>

1469
01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:32.970
<v Speaker 4>a fellow new Japan pro wrestling at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

1470
01:01:33.030 --> 01:01:35.910
<v Speaker 4>And it still is Eugene anegada fought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fueled our.</v>

1471
01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:41.420
<v Speaker 4>And here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he got pushed into that like three or </v>

1472
01:01:41.730 --> 01:01:42.730
<v Speaker 4>four weeks out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1473
01:01:42.731 --> 01:01:45.600
<v Speaker 4>my niece.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And his attitude was just like,</v>

1474
01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:46.430
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well this,</v>

1475
01:01:46.530 --> 01:01:47.400
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to do it.</v>

1476
01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:48.840
<v Speaker 4>They want them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they want me to fight him.</v>

1477
01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:54.080
<v Speaker 4>So to make sure that this guy in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fuel basically fights on this card and </v>

1478
01:01:54.181 --> 01:01:59.181
<v Speaker 4>they have a match where people are going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be all interested to see it because </v>

1479
01:01:59.181 --> 01:01:59.181
<v Speaker 4>I'm another name,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll do it.</v>

1480
01:01:59.181 --> 01:02:01.080
<v Speaker 4>And so I did my best to help him out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>train him.</v>

1481
01:02:01.081 --> 01:02:06.081
<v Speaker 4>I even paid stitch to who was there with</v>
<v Speaker 4>me as my cut and quarter guy to go to </v>

1482
01:02:06.331 --> 01:02:11.331
<v Speaker 4>wrap his hands and work on his cuts too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I did the best I could and I </v>

1483
01:02:11.331 --> 01:02:14.811
<v Speaker 4>cornered the Kata and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there wasn't all right corner to Nevada </v>

1484
01:02:14.811 --> 01:02:15.450
<v Speaker 4>and they're just eating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just wasn't.</v>

1485
01:02:15.630 --> 01:02:17.010
<v Speaker 4>He Won.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's not even fighting.</v>

1486
01:02:17.011 --> 01:02:22.011
<v Speaker 4>I mean we used to spar and wrestle and </v>
<v Speaker 4>grapple and do all kinds of stuff on </v>

1487
01:02:22.011 --> 01:02:23.140
<v Speaker 4>tour all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here we are always working out together,</v>

1488
01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:28.500
<v Speaker 4>but that's way different from training </v>
<v Speaker 4>for a fight and they're trying to fight </v>

1489
01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:29.560
<v Speaker 4>one of the absolute best guys in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>

1490
01:02:29.561 --> 01:02:31.150
<v Speaker 4>And then on like three weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>notice it.</v>

1491
01:02:31.690 --> 01:02:34.000
<v Speaker 4>The a trouper man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a real fucking awesome dude.</v>

1492
01:02:34.001 --> 01:02:35.950
<v Speaker 4>But he got pushed into it.</v>

1493
01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:40.980
<v Speaker 4>There's a different attitude though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're in Japan to organize what it's </v>

1494
01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:42.070
<v Speaker 4>called.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She organized means it can't be helped.</v>

1495
01:02:42.670 --> 01:02:45.840
<v Speaker 4>So that's basically the attitude is if </v>
<v Speaker 4>you know something shit,</v>

1496
01:02:45.850 --> 01:02:50.850
<v Speaker 4>he goes down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever reactor start melting down and </v>

1497
01:02:50.850 --> 01:02:53.581
<v Speaker 4>you as this technician or just going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>go in there knowing you're going to </v>

1498
01:02:53.581 --> 01:02:57.720
<v Speaker 4>basically your community,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to die and you're going to </v>

1499
01:02:57.720 --> 01:02:57.720
<v Speaker 4>go into your ship.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That thing down anyways,</v>

1500
01:02:57.720 --> 01:02:58.930
<v Speaker 4>Shogun,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't be helped.</v>

1501
01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:04.860
<v Speaker 4>That's hard for us to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that's why a tragedy hits Japan </v>

1502
01:03:04.860 --> 01:03:07.360
<v Speaker 4>like that and people stand in line,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't flip out.</v>

1503
01:03:07.710 --> 01:03:10.480
<v Speaker 4>They take care of each other,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's beautiful.</v>

1504
01:03:10.481 --> 01:03:11.230
<v Speaker 4>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>

1505
01:03:11.231 --> 01:03:14.140
<v Speaker 4>And that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was another thing like the cultures</v>

1506
01:03:14.141 --> 01:03:17.650
<v Speaker 4>around the world are all different in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the way they operate are all different.</v>

1507
01:03:17.651 --> 01:03:20.230
<v Speaker 4>So like when all the crazy shit that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>been going on in the U,</v>

1508
01:03:20.231 --> 01:03:25.231
<v Speaker 4>s and then people are going rampant like</v>
<v Speaker 4>rabid dogs throwing out statistics from </v>

1509
01:03:25.231 --> 01:03:30.001
<v Speaker 4>this country and that country and this </v>
<v Speaker 4>country all about different things and </v>

1510
01:03:30.001 --> 01:03:31.530
<v Speaker 4>it's like you can't really compare us to</v>
<v Speaker 4>Japan or us to the UK or us.</v>

1511
01:03:31.910 --> 01:03:36.910
<v Speaker 4>Like every.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're all different cultures and you </v>

1512
01:03:36.910 --> 01:03:38.410
<v Speaker 4>may only can compare America to America </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the way that we are.</v>

1513
01:03:38.411 --> 01:03:43.411
<v Speaker 4>People are educated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The way that our government system </v>

1514
01:03:43.411 --> 01:03:45.811
<v Speaker 4>works,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way that the populace is divided up </v>

1515
01:03:45.811 --> 01:03:46.270
<v Speaker 4>in the land that they live in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the type of philosophies that they carry</v>

1516
01:03:46.271 --> 01:03:51.271
<v Speaker 4>and the culture that drives them makes </v>
<v Speaker 4>them unique to America and no place </v>

1517
01:03:51.271 --> 01:03:51.910
<v Speaker 4>else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1518
01:03:51.911 --> 01:03:54.670
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to wrap your head around that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For a lot of people.</v>

1519
01:03:54.671 --> 01:03:55.990
<v Speaker 4>They think that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1520
01:03:56.010 --> 01:03:56.650
<v Speaker 4>if we have</v>

1521
01:03:56.670 --> 01:04:01.670
<v Speaker 2>the same access to weapons as people do </v>
<v Speaker 2>in other parts of the world and we'd </v>

1522
01:04:01.681 --> 01:04:04.980
<v Speaker 2>have the same results,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not the case because you look</v>

1523
01:04:04.981 --> 01:04:09.981
<v Speaker 2>at parts of Africa where we've got </v>
<v Speaker 2>complete total immersion and crime,</v>

1524
01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:16.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you look at Liberia and the amount </v>

1525
01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:16.160
<v Speaker 2>of guns and violence and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's parts of the world that are</v>

1526
01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:16.160
<v Speaker 2>just violent</v>

1527
01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:20.510
<v Speaker 4>that just murdering each other everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just about this apparently South Africa.</v>

1528
01:04:20.511 --> 01:04:21.340
<v Speaker 4>Even the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1529
01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:24.040
<v Speaker 4>what you think of as a civilized more </v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1530
01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:26.060
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1531
01:04:26.210 --> 01:04:31.210
<v Speaker 4>developed parts of Africa in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 4>like a society and a or like just like </v>

1532
01:04:32.181 --> 01:04:35.130
<v Speaker 4>city and modern type infrastructure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not here to,</v>

1533
01:04:35.290 --> 01:04:36.590
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to declare that,</v>

1534
01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:38.660
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one way of living is better than say,</v>

1535
01:04:38.661 --> 01:04:40.520
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an aboriginal,</v>

1536
01:04:40.550 --> 01:04:41.120

<v Speaker 4>who cares?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You were just talking about technology,</v>

1538
01:04:43.070 --> 01:04:45.710
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So even in those,</v>

1539
01:04:45.711 --> 01:04:48.020
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's like these people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1547
01:05:05.211 --> 01:05:10.211

1567
01:06:06.310 --> 01:06:10.630

<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me hit this switch real quick.</v>

1610
01:07:56.731 --> 01:07:58.800
<v Speaker 3>Where you got this gun in my face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>

1611
01:07:58.801 --> 01:08:01.980
<v Speaker 3>it's not a flame thrower that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting for pain.</v>

1612
01:08:01.981 --> 01:08:05.010
<v Speaker 3>You smell that says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

1613
01:08:05.070 --> 01:08:06.450
<v Speaker 3>you need bulletproof class too.</v>

1614
01:08:06.590 --> 01:08:11.590
<v Speaker 4>They probably offer that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can you imagine getting in a car </v>

1615
01:08:11.590 --> 01:08:11.590
<v Speaker 4>accident?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your car just blow up.</v>

1616
01:08:11.590 --> 01:08:12.340
<v Speaker 4>God bless you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God you to see BMW.</v>

1617
01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:13.850
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that's what I'm talking about.</v>

1618
01:08:13.851 --> 01:08:14.540
<v Speaker 4>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1619
01:08:14.541 --> 01:08:15.320
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1620
01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:20.840
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's cultures and societies are </v>

1621
01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:22.610
<v Speaker 4>radically different everywhere now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't necessarily need flame thrower,</v>

1622
01:08:23.090 --> 01:08:24.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>things on our cars.</v>

1623
01:08:24.740 --> 01:08:26.300
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are probably,</v>

1624
01:08:26.301 --> 01:08:29.930
<v Speaker 4>are parts of the US,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Detroit potentially,</v>

1625
01:08:29.931 --> 01:08:32.490
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a whole lot about Detroit supposed to be</v>

1626
01:08:32.491 --> 01:08:32.910
<v Speaker 4>the best,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1627
01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:34.820
<v Speaker 4>it's supposed to be real bad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>

1628
01:08:35.750 --> 01:08:38.420
<v Speaker 4>I mean that is a viable option.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1629
01:08:38.421 --> 01:08:43.421
<v Speaker 4>that could be unnecessary and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I want to run around flame </v>

1630
01:08:43.421 --> 01:08:46.811
<v Speaker 4>throwing people for freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>although I try to do most things for </v>

1631
01:08:46.811 --> 01:08:47.510
<v Speaker 4>freedom as long as you do it with a good</v>
<v Speaker 4>country music background.</v>

1632
01:08:47.990 --> 01:08:49.690
<v Speaker 4>And the belt buckles big something six.</v>

1633
01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:51.290
<v Speaker 4>He gets something hanging in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>background.</v>

1634
01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:56.840
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you burn you Lug Eagle inside my heart,</v>

1635
01:08:58.890 --> 01:09:03.890
<v Speaker 4>fire straight from Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the blood guy.</v>

1636
01:09:04.790 --> 01:09:05.730
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1637
01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:08.780
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but how about this,</v>

1638
01:09:08.781 --> 01:09:09.470
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>think about,</v>

1639
01:09:09.471 --> 01:09:10.550
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're driving in your car,</v>

1640
01:09:10.551 --> 01:09:12.650
<v Speaker 4>you've got your kids and whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And some asshole comes up.</v>

1641
01:09:12.651 --> 01:09:14.720
<v Speaker 4>He wants to carjack you and let's just </v>
<v Speaker 4>be honest.</v>

1642
01:09:14.721 --> 01:09:16.610
<v Speaker 4>One send me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody starts pulling guns,</v>

1643
01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:21.620
<v Speaker 4>knives,</v>
<v Speaker 4>any type of weapon he wants to do harm </v>

1644
01:09:21.620 --> 01:09:21.620
<v Speaker 4>to you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but for,</v>

1645
01:09:21.620 --> 01:09:24.441
<v Speaker 4>for his own purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have no idea what they're going to </v>

1646
01:09:24.441 --> 01:09:24.441
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1647
01:09:24.441 --> 01:09:28.301
<v Speaker 4>well he's just going to know he's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't know if he's just going to </v>

1648
01:09:28.301 --> 01:09:28.301
<v Speaker 4>steal your shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1649
01:09:28.301 --> 01:09:28.301
<v Speaker 4>you have no clue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1650
01:09:28.301 --> 01:09:31.490
<v Speaker 4>there was a report of a these dudes and </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1651
01:09:31.491 --> 01:09:33.690
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it was Mississippi.</v>

1652
01:09:33.691 --> 01:09:38.120
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was like a bad news ghetto area,</v>

1653
01:09:38.180 --> 01:09:38.480
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1654
01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:43.480
<v Speaker 4>It was like a gnarly spot where these </v>
<v Speaker 4>were folks who were living and </v>

1655
01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:46.220
<v Speaker 4>apparently these dudes carjack some </v>
<v Speaker 4>little couple and took them back,</v>

1656
01:09:46.830 --> 01:09:47.930
<v Speaker 4>took their car,</v>
<v Speaker 4>took their shit,</v>

1657
01:09:47.931 --> 01:09:49.850
<v Speaker 4>took them back to their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to their,</v>

1658
01:09:49.910 --> 01:09:52.400
<v Speaker 4>to the residence or wherever we're were </v>
<v Speaker 4>were these,</v>

1659
01:09:52.401 --> 01:09:57.401
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these nefarious dudes or staying and </v>

1660
01:09:57.401 --> 01:09:57.401
<v Speaker 4>then tortured and raped them and killed </v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

1661
01:09:57.401 --> 01:09:58.670
<v Speaker 4>And then through their bodies in a trap </v>
<v Speaker 4>and a dumpster.</v>

1662
01:09:58.970 --> 01:10:03.970
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it wasn't even enough to just take </v>

1663
01:10:03.970 --> 01:10:03.970
<v Speaker 4>someone's car,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their possessions and belongings,</v>

1664
01:10:03.970 --> 01:10:08.951
<v Speaker 4>but took like this boyfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 4>girlfriend and fucking mutilated them </v>

1665
01:10:08.951 --> 01:10:09.440
<v Speaker 4>and did horrible shit to him and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>kill them.</v>

1666
01:10:09.770 --> 01:10:11.500
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

1667
01:10:11.530 --> 01:10:16.530
<v Speaker 4>well it can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's just the thing is that you don't </v>

1668
01:10:16.530 --> 01:10:16.530
<v Speaker 4>know what somebody who has ill intent </v>
<v Speaker 4>for you is,</v>

1669
01:10:16.530 --> 01:10:21.010
<v Speaker 4>it really has up to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I've had people talk to me about </v>

1670
01:10:21.010 --> 01:10:21.010
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1671
01:10:21.010 --> 01:10:21.590
<v Speaker 4>what happens if he pulls a gun on you?</v>

1672
01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:23.120
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like give them what they want,</v>

1673
01:10:23.121 --> 01:10:28.121
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not trying to to bargain my life </v>

1674
01:10:28.121 --> 01:10:30.860
<v Speaker 4>versus a bullet over a wallet with some </v>
<v Speaker 4>money in it or whatever.</v>

1675
01:10:30.861 --> 01:10:35.861
<v Speaker 4>Like that's just not that important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I also think in my head like you </v>

1676
01:10:35.861 --> 01:10:39.560
<v Speaker 4>have to assess a situation and it might </v>
<v Speaker 4>become absolutely clear that I'm,</v>

1677
01:10:39.620 --> 01:10:41.960
<v Speaker 4>this guy might not have any intention of</v>
<v Speaker 4>letting me go.</v>

1678
01:10:42.410 --> 01:10:44.270
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of that in the world or </v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1679
01:10:44.271 --> 01:10:45.740
<v Speaker 4>if someone pulls a knife on me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1680
01:10:45.741 --> 01:10:46.790
<v Speaker 4>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hope never.</v>

1681
01:10:47.140 --> 01:10:49.700
<v Speaker 4>And I like why I go because if someone </v>
<v Speaker 4>pulls a knife on me,</v>

1682
01:10:49.701 --> 01:10:51.380
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to murder them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I have to.</v>

1683
01:10:51.770 --> 01:10:55.280
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm not going to stop until he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>dead because he's got a fucking knife.</v>

1684
01:10:55.310 --> 01:10:57.980
<v Speaker 4>I don't know where his friends are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know anything about what's going</v>

1685
01:10:57.981 --> 01:11:02.981
<v Speaker 4>on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All I know is it the minutes a weapon </v>

1686
01:11:02.981 --> 01:11:02.981
<v Speaker 4>gets pulled on my person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They intend for me to die.</v>

1687
01:11:02.981 --> 01:11:05.300
<v Speaker 4>Whether they actually don't have the </v>
<v Speaker 4>guts to go through with it or not,</v>

1688
01:11:05.301 --> 01:11:07.250
<v Speaker 4>or maybe that just they just want my </v>
<v Speaker 4>belongings.</v>

1689
01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:10.760
<v Speaker 4>I don't know that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't read minds.</v>

1690
01:11:10.761 --> 01:11:13.470
<v Speaker 4>I just know someone wants to cut and </v>
<v Speaker 4>like kill me to my shit.</v>

1691
01:11:13.740 --> 01:11:18.740
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a mindset that a lot of people </v>

1692
01:11:18.740 --> 01:11:20.310
<v Speaker 2>have where if you concentrate on things </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>

1693
01:11:20.340 --> 01:11:25.340
<v Speaker 2>you could sort of manifest it and if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>spend all your time worrying about </v>

1694
01:11:25.340 --> 01:11:28.731
<v Speaker 2>people attacking you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you know you're going to invite </v>

1695
01:11:28.731 --> 01:11:31.701
<v Speaker 2>that shit into your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people that really </v>

1696
01:11:31.701 --> 01:11:31.701
<v Speaker 2>believe that and they also believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1697
01:11:31.701 --> 01:11:36.240
<v Speaker 2>really the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the evolved way to be is to just never,</v>

1698
01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:39.150
<v Speaker 2>never get into any sort of an </v>
<v Speaker 2>altercation with anybody and try to keep</v>

1699
01:11:39.151 --> 01:11:42.660
<v Speaker 2>society as civil as possible and as many</v>
<v Speaker 2>last as possible.</v>

1700
01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:45.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see their point of view.</v>

1701
01:11:45.210 --> 01:11:50.210
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the real problem is the randomness of </v>

1702
01:11:50.210 --> 01:11:50.210
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

1703
01:11:50.210 --> 01:11:50.920
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see their point of view too,</v>

1704
01:11:50.921 --> 01:11:55.000
<v Speaker 4>but I think it's pretty obvious where </v>
<v Speaker 4>that type of concept goes.</v>

1705
01:11:55.030 --> 01:11:56.330
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like killed.</v>

1706
01:11:56.740 --> 01:11:57.520
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can get,</v>

1707
01:11:57.690 --> 01:12:02.690
<v Speaker 4>not only can you get killed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but now all of a sudden you take away </v>

1708
01:12:02.690 --> 01:12:04.981
<v Speaker 4>the ability to be the kind of any kind </v>
<v Speaker 4>of per person than any individual that </v>

1709
01:12:05.531 --> 01:12:07.910
<v Speaker 4>you want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All of a sudden you become some you can.</v>

1710
01:12:07.911 --> 01:12:09.760
<v Speaker 4>Part of this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm fucked up and ran novel.</v>

1711
01:12:09.910 --> 01:12:12.130
<v Speaker 4>We can't even use the word I anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

1712
01:12:12.290 --> 01:12:13.330
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whoa.</v>

1713
01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:16.030
<v Speaker 4>That's why would you want to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's yeah,</v>

1714
01:12:16.031 --> 01:12:17.770
<v Speaker 4>it may be peaceful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but how is that?</v>

1715
01:12:17.771 --> 01:12:21.960
<v Speaker 4>That's a repression of of the human </v>
<v Speaker 4>spirit and and like that.</v>

1716
01:12:21.961 --> 01:12:23.590
<v Speaker 4>There's no growth in that.</v>

1717
01:12:23.620 --> 01:12:24.490
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only that,</v>

1718
01:12:24.550 --> 01:12:29.550
<v Speaker 2>you're allowing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing a shitty job of preserving </v>

1719
01:12:29.550 --> 01:12:30.760
<v Speaker 2>your own excellent genetics by allowing </v>
<v Speaker 2>some cut bag to take you out.</v>

1720
01:12:30.790 --> 01:12:33.400
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you intellectually,</v>

1721
01:12:33.401 --> 01:12:38.401
<v Speaker 2>you have made a decision early in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>life to prepare for something like this </v>

1722
01:12:38.401 --> 01:12:41.970
<v Speaker 2>so that if something goes down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not physically completely inapt </v>

1723

<v Speaker 2>get injured or not,</v>

1724
01:12:43.210 --> 01:12:48.210
<v Speaker 2>and if somebody goes to do you bodily </v>
<v Speaker 2>harm and they don't understand that </v>

<v Speaker 2>Whereas another person in the same </v>

1727
01:12:53.310 --> 01:12:53.530
<v Speaker 2>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could think you're smart all day,</v>

1730
01:13:00.390 --> 01:13:00.520
<v Speaker 4>the street.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the thing is,</v>

1731
01:13:00.730 --> 01:13:04.660
<v Speaker 4>it could be as simple as a home dude </v>
<v Speaker 4>from a nxs right?</v>

<v Speaker 4>no</v>

1734
01:13:08.910 --> 01:13:10.100
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy died jerking off.</v>

1735
01:13:10.130 --> 01:13:11.990
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got it from Nsx in excess.</v>

1736
01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:13.220
<v Speaker 2>He killed himself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1737
01:13:13.221 --> 01:13:14.120
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he died.</v>

1738
01:13:14.150 --> 01:13:17.840
<v Speaker 2>It was auto erotic association is one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>a slew.</v>

1739
01:13:17.841 --> 01:13:18.770
<v Speaker 2>Trust me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a God damn.</v>

1740
01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:20.460
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that may be so,</v>

1741
01:13:20.461 --> 01:13:22.430
<v Speaker 4>but up leading up to that point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1742
01:13:22.770 --> 01:13:27.770
<v Speaker 4>he was drunk as fuck apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And got an altercation with somebody </v>

1743
01:13:27.770 --> 01:13:31.311
<v Speaker 4>you've got shoved and he fell and he has</v>
<v Speaker 4>head on a curb and the repercussions </v>

1744
01:13:31.311 --> 01:13:35.690
<v Speaker 4>from that was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he received brain damage to where he </v>

1745
01:13:35.690 --> 01:13:37.740
<v Speaker 4>couldn't smell or taste anymore really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it drove him nuts.</v>

1746
01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:39.760
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Himself.</v>

1747
01:13:39.870 --> 01:13:44.870
<v Speaker 4>But that was just simply falling down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hitting his head and he could hit his </v>

1748
01:13:44.870 --> 01:13:45.900
<v Speaker 4>head on the curb like 50 times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And who knows how it could turn out,</v>

1749
01:13:46.110 --> 01:13:47.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it could have burned him right there and</v>

1750
01:13:47.731 --> 01:13:52.731
<v Speaker 4>killed him or taken done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just given them a crack and needed some </v>

1751
01:13:52.731 --> 01:13:55.380
<v Speaker 4>stitches.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It could be just a big goose egg.</v>

<v Speaker 4>How long did it last forum?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like A.</v>

1753
01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:00.480
<v Speaker 4>I think it was a permanent thing for how</v>
<v Speaker 4>many years?</v>

1754
01:14:00.510 --> 01:14:01.440
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

1755
01:14:01.441 --> 01:14:06.441
<v Speaker 4>but I believe it was a permanent thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it wasn't coming back so he </v>

1756
01:14:06.441 --> 01:14:09.150
<v Speaker 4>couldn't taste anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Taste or smell Jesus Christ.</v>

01:14:12.180 --> 01:14:16.180
<v Speaker 2>That was actually what was described to </v>
<v Speaker 2>me as part of the huge issue was that he</v>

1760
01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:16.430
<v Speaker 2>loved</v>

1761
01:14:16.850 --> 01:14:18.740
<v Speaker 4>how much you can never taste a woman </v>
<v Speaker 4>ever again.</v>

1763
01:14:25.210 --> 01:14:26.861
<v Speaker 4>to think of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's also to show you that you </v>

1767
01:14:29.511 --> 01:14:34.511

<v Speaker 4>through it.</v>

<v Speaker 4>be able to be cognizant or aware in that</v>
<v Speaker 4>moment at all.</v>

01:21:31.050 --> 01:21:35.580
<v Speaker 3>We're working on the bed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's important sometimes for girls </v>

1951
01:21:35.580 --> 01:21:35.580
<v Speaker 3>fucking throw the animals out of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>room,</v>

1952
01:21:35.580 --> 01:21:38.640
<v Speaker 3>but it can get to the point where it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>so wet.</v>

1953
01:21:38.730 --> 01:21:40.380
<v Speaker 3>You gotta you just gotTa wipe away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1954
01:21:40.381 --> 01:21:43.560
<v Speaker 3>You gotta you gotta clean off and keep </v>
<v Speaker 3>going because you can't feel anything.</v>

1955
01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:48.240
<v Speaker 3>It's just like girls that just goes </v>
<v Speaker 3>overboard.</v>

1956
01:21:48.241 --> 01:21:51.240
<v Speaker 3>But fortunately I have a gigantic cox so</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not an issue.</v>

1957
01:21:51.270 --> 01:21:52.590
<v Speaker 3>Oh perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's tight.</v>

1958
01:21:52.650 --> 01:21:54.650
<v Speaker 3>It just fucking just stretches that </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole St.</v>

1959
01:21:55.530 --> 01:21:57.180
<v Speaker 3>they should drink pedialyte so they </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>

1960
01:21:57.210 --> 01:21:58.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dehydrated.</v>

1961
01:21:58.330 --> 01:22:02.990
<v Speaker 3>So I was thinking to myself because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought when I don't have a gigantic car</v>

1962
01:22:03.350 --> 01:22:06.240
<v Speaker 3>in the interest of full disclosure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want a lot of the people,</v>

1963
01:22:06.420 --> 01:22:08.820
<v Speaker 3>but when we're going to come up to you </v>
<v Speaker 3>at a show and be like,</v>

1964
01:22:08.830 --> 01:22:10.290
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me see how big your cock is.</v>

1965
01:22:10.300 --> 01:22:12.570
<v Speaker 3>Like it was just when I was dating this </v>
<v Speaker 3>girl.</v>

1966
01:22:12.630 --> 01:22:15.540
<v Speaker 3>Obviously I didn't know any better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was only like 18,</v>

1967
01:22:15.541 --> 01:22:17.940
<v Speaker 3>19 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know that everybody wasn't like</v>

1968
01:22:17.941 --> 01:22:20.040
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know that one day.</v>

1969
01:22:20.041 --> 01:22:21.690
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a lot of like young girls,</v>

1970
01:22:21.750 --> 01:22:24.390
<v Speaker 3>they get really wet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then you get older and you realize,</v>

1971
01:22:24.420 --> 01:22:25.320
<v Speaker 3>oh wait a minute.</v>

1972
01:22:25.350 --> 01:22:27.600
<v Speaker 3>That was like his wet as a girl ever got</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever.</v>

1973
01:22:28.140 --> 01:22:28.860
<v Speaker 3>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1974
01:22:28.861 --> 01:22:33.861
<v Speaker 3>well that was our prime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like her baby making prime was when she </v>

1975
01:22:33.861 --> 01:22:34.050
<v Speaker 3>was 16,</v>
<v Speaker 3>17.</v>

1976
01:22:34.051 --> 01:22:37.500
<v Speaker 3>Maybe she just had less hangups with </v>
<v Speaker 3>women.</v>

1977
01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:40.260
<v Speaker 3>Then it's all about the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if they don't want to come,</v>

1978
01:22:40.261 --> 01:22:43.020
<v Speaker 3>they ain't coming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some girls can't come right now.</v>

1979
01:22:43.021 --> 01:22:45.810
<v Speaker 3>There's that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a tragedy because they,</v>

1980
01:22:45.811 --> 01:22:47.910
<v Speaker 3>they should uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1981
01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:48.760
<v Speaker 3>have that out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1982
01:22:48.860 --> 01:22:51.870
<v Speaker 3>it's up to them and you've got girls </v>
<v Speaker 3>will say to you,</v>

1983
01:22:51.871 --> 01:22:52.590
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck you,</v>

1984
01:22:52.591 --> 01:22:54.210
<v Speaker 3>you didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you didn't make her calm.</v>

1985
01:22:54.211 --> 01:22:55.890
<v Speaker 3>She can come.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just can't make her kind of like,</v>

1986
01:22:56.340 --> 01:22:57.840
<v Speaker 3>trust me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some,</v>

1987
01:22:57.930 --> 01:23:00.390
<v Speaker 3>there's some girls that were technical </v>
<v Speaker 3>difficulty or something,</v>

1988
01:23:00.410 --> 01:23:02.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't put it out right.</v>

1989
01:23:02.461 --> 01:23:04.710
<v Speaker 3>But honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a lot of times it's really.</v>

1990
01:23:04.711 --> 01:23:05.920
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if she's not</v>

1991
01:23:06.460 --> 01:23:08.770
<v Speaker 4>comfortable at 100 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's not where she needs to be,</v>

1992
01:23:08.771 --> 01:23:13.771
<v Speaker 4>or even if she's not comfortable with </v>
<v Speaker 4>her body enough to know how to make </v>

1993
01:23:13.771 --> 01:23:14.090
<v Speaker 4>herself call sensitive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1995
01:23:17.411 --> 01:23:19.060

<v Speaker 4>medicals?</v>

1996
01:23:19.070 --> 01:23:24.070
<v Speaker 4>Are they too tight?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want me to let you out of the </v>

1997
01:23:24.070 --> 01:23:24.070
<v Speaker 4>basement,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joshua?</v>

1998
01:23:24.070 --> 01:23:25.870
<v Speaker 4>It's like the Grad data in high school.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could fit so easily.</v>

1999
01:23:26.330 --> 01:23:27.640
<v Speaker 4>Every thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every girl you could fit.</v>

2000
01:23:27.740 --> 01:23:32.740
<v Speaker 4>Every girl was festival when your hands </v>
<v Speaker 4>were little back then you were just </v>

2001
01:23:32.740 --> 01:23:32.740
<v Speaker 4>growing up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I can,</v>

2002
01:23:32.740 --> 01:23:35.560
<v Speaker 4>if I can at least karate chop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a little bit and I'm good to go.</v>

2003
01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:36.220
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2004
01:23:36.221 --> 01:23:38.650
<v Speaker 4>it's funny how one girl respond to one </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

2005
01:23:38.660 --> 01:23:40.920
<v Speaker 4>Then you try that on another girl in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking angry.</v>

<v Speaker 4>you have to,</v>

2065
01:25:42.351 --> 01:25:44.240
<v Speaker 4>but do you do judge them?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Know,</v>

2066
01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:45.680
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2067
01:25:45.690 --> 01:25:47.060
<v Speaker 4>I mean every,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every,</v>

2068
01:25:47.300 --> 01:25:52.300
<v Speaker 4>every person is different and you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>definitely tell the difference between </v>

2069
01:25:52.300 --> 01:25:52.300
<v Speaker 4>ones where there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2070
01:25:52.300 --> 01:25:54.040
<v Speaker 4>there's some psychological fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>issues going on here and some that just,</v>

2071
01:25:54.110 --> 01:25:59.110
<v Speaker 4>they see me as the facilitator of a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of an open fucking apparently Aka the </v>

2072
01:26:00.351 --> 01:26:01.910
<v Speaker 4>good ones I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2073
01:26:01.911 --> 01:26:03.330
<v Speaker 4>Those are the ones that are guilt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2074
01:26:03.340 --> 01:26:08.340
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've had plenty of chicks that liked </v>

2075
01:26:08.340 --> 01:26:09.950
<v Speaker 4>getting the shit ragdoll out of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we're awesome.</v>

2076
01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:12.470
<v Speaker 4>SMART,</v>
<v Speaker 4>normal mean.</v>

2077
01:26:12.490 --> 01:26:17.490
<v Speaker 4>Just good people like they're red and </v>
<v Speaker 4>their bedroom habits don't necessarily </v>

2078
01:26:17.490 --> 01:26:19.580
<v Speaker 4>aren't always an indication of what </v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody is as a person.</v>

2079
01:26:19.581 --> 01:26:24.581
<v Speaker 4>That's always like one of my big issues.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why people are always being such </v>

2080
01:26:24.581 --> 01:26:27.200
<v Speaker 4>assholes about gay people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like I don't give a fuck what he or</v>

2081
01:26:27.201 --> 01:26:29.090
<v Speaker 4>her does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If they're gay at all,</v>

2082
01:26:29.150 --> 01:26:31.070
<v Speaker 4>like how has that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not.</v>

2083
01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:36.160
<v Speaker 4>They are a amalgamation of all these </v>
<v Speaker 4>different things and who they fuck is </v>

2084
01:26:36.651 --> 01:26:38.360
<v Speaker 4>only one small part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2085
01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:39.090
<v Speaker 4>It's okay.</v>

2086
01:26:39.150 --> 01:26:40.880
<v Speaker 2>It's an.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a dumb person's argument.</v>

2087
01:26:41.030 --> 01:26:46.030
<v Speaker 2>Either dumb or my joke is you the dumb </v>
<v Speaker 2>or you secretly worried that dicks are </v>

2088
01:26:46.030 --> 01:26:46.490
<v Speaker 2>delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are the only two reasons why you'd</v>

2089
01:26:46.491 --> 01:26:47.330
<v Speaker 2>be upset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2090
01:26:47.331 --> 01:26:51.350
<v Speaker 2>my Dick seems to be very delicious as </v>
<v Speaker 2>far as how flexible are you,</v>

2091
01:26:51.390 --> 01:26:52.340
<v Speaker 2>John?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2092
01:26:52.341 --> 01:26:55.370
<v Speaker 2>I can't rubber guard so I have to still </v>
<v Speaker 2>keep finding these chicks,</v>

2093
01:26:55.371 --> 01:26:58.370
<v Speaker 2>but I've been told by the time my </v>
<v Speaker 2>dictates famous,</v>

2094
01:26:58.420 --> 01:27:02.290
<v Speaker 2>I had been told that famous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're dictates famous w,</v>

2095
01:27:02.310 --> 01:27:03.500
<v Speaker 2>w.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What else did he tell you?</v>

2096
01:27:09.330 --> 01:27:14.330
<v Speaker 2>My now where people are getting so super</v>
<v Speaker 2>angry because the sound levels are not </v>

2097
01:27:14.330 --> 01:27:14.330
<v Speaker 2>equalized.</v>

2098
01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:16.410
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what can we do to do this?</v>

2099
01:27:16.411 --> 01:27:17.820
<v Speaker 5>There's something we can do about that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Brian,</v>

2100
01:27:17.850 --> 01:27:19.350
<v Speaker 5>because people are constantly </v>
<v Speaker 5>complaining,</v>

2101
01:27:19.351 --> 01:27:24.351
<v Speaker 5>but they're always complaining that this</v>
<v Speaker 5>out of 1 million people that listen to </v>

2102
01:27:24.351 --> 01:27:27.841
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's always going to be two people </v>

2103
01:27:27.841 --> 01:27:27.841
<v Speaker 5>that tweet you but the sound,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but apparently there are large spikes.</v>

2104
01:27:27.841 --> 01:27:30.260
<v Speaker 5>If you have something you're always </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to have,</v>

2105
01:27:30.330 --> 01:27:31.800
<v Speaker 5>you're always going to have large </v>
<v Speaker 5>spikes.</v>

2106
01:27:31.801 --> 01:27:33.320
<v Speaker 5>It's if you have certain people like </v>
<v Speaker 5>joey ideas.</v>

2107
01:27:33.330 --> 01:27:37.040
<v Speaker 5>Where's that Josh Barnett fucking Viking</v>
<v Speaker 5>Shit going on here.</v>

2108
01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:38.300
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2109
01:27:38.350 --> 01:27:43.350
<v Speaker 4>here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a and anybody that's completely </v>

2110
01:27:43.350 --> 01:27:47.271
<v Speaker 4>cool and love something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they often don't say a fucking thing </v>

2111
01:27:47.271 --> 01:27:50.210
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anybody that wants to be a negative </v>

2112
01:27:50.210 --> 01:27:52.220
<v Speaker 4>piece of shit like go out there and </v>
<v Speaker 4>spoil it for everyone and just shit all </v>

2113
01:27:52.220 --> 01:27:53.400
<v Speaker 4>over the world with all their negative </v>
<v Speaker 4>garbage bullshit.</v>

2114
01:27:54.950 --> 01:27:58.200
<v Speaker 4>They want to talk the most people with </v>
<v Speaker 4>the least to say want to be heard them.</v>

2115
01:27:58.201 --> 01:27:58.320
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2116
01:27:58.340 --> 01:28:01.220
<v Speaker 2>So there's a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there also is a lot of.</v>

2117
01:28:01.310 --> 01:28:05.360
<v Speaker 2>I learned a lot from the criticism that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not applying that with a broad brush</v>

2118
01:28:05.361 --> 01:28:06.430
<v Speaker 2>across.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm just,</v>

2119
01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:11.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying I need to qualify myself</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I don't want people to think a </v>

2120
01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:15.280
<v Speaker 2>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the shit that people have said </v>

2121
01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:17.741
<v Speaker 2>to us about the show and me as a standup</v>
<v Speaker 2>and me as a commentator and it means a </v>

2122
01:28:17.741 --> 01:28:20.020
<v Speaker 2>comedian I said that are sort of twice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2123
01:28:20.390 --> 01:28:22.640
<v Speaker 2>I've learned a lot from douche bags.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's,</v>

2124
01:28:22.641 --> 01:28:25.250
<v Speaker 2>it seems like you wouldn't because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're there being county,</v>

2125
01:28:25.370 --> 01:28:26.180
<v Speaker 2>but then you got to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2126
01:28:26.181 --> 01:28:28.390
<v Speaker 2>if they even have a point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like even a tiny point,</v>

2127
01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:32.390
<v Speaker 2>they can say something and then all you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to do is figure out what that thing</v>

2128
01:28:32.391 --> 01:28:35.540
<v Speaker 2>is and take that away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you have a fix that weakness,</v>

2129
01:28:35.630 --> 01:28:36.880
<v Speaker 2>now they can't say shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

2130
01:28:36.950 --> 01:28:41.950
<v Speaker 2>If they do say Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well then it doesn't mean anything </v>

2131
01:28:41.950 --> 01:28:41.950
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It only means something.</v>

2132
01:28:41.950 --> 01:28:42.920
<v Speaker 2>If you really feel like there's some </v>
<v Speaker 2>merit to what they're saying,</v>

2133
01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:46.180
<v Speaker 4>some of the dumbest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just most asinine trite that gets thrown</v>

2134
01:28:46.181 --> 01:28:49.930
<v Speaker 4>at you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not always easy to do,</v>

2135
01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:54.960
<v Speaker 4>but you realize,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it is possible to learn in some </v>

2136
01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:59.551
<v Speaker 4>way from all of this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes it isn't anything learning </v>

2137
01:28:59.551 --> 01:29:02.911
<v Speaker 4>necessarily directly about you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this could be by seeing what this </v>

2138
01:29:02.911 --> 01:29:07.821
<v Speaker 4>person is doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>being on the receiving end of these </v>

2139
01:29:07.821 --> 01:29:07.821
<v Speaker 4>things and you can look back and you can</v>
<v Speaker 4>think about,</v>

2140
01:29:07.821 --> 01:29:11.901
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how have I done anything remotely like </v>

2141
01:29:11.901 --> 01:29:11.901
<v Speaker 4>that in my own life?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How?</v>

2142
01:29:11.901 --> 01:29:16.550
<v Speaker 4>How have I ever acted in such a way that</v>
<v Speaker 4>is on that same level of like just </v>

2143
01:29:19.410 --> 01:29:24.410
<v Speaker 4>shittiness this guy is doing to me?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or why is it that people or are are know</v>

2144
01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:28.160
<v Speaker 4>exerting this kind of terrible attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2145
01:29:28.270 --> 01:29:29.400
<v Speaker 4>via that anonymity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2146
01:29:29.401 --> 01:29:34.401
<v Speaker 4>there's so many things that your brain </v>
<v Speaker 4>can go to where it's an opportunity for </v>

2147
01:29:34.401 --> 01:29:37.350
<v Speaker 4>you to to expand upon who you are as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>person.</v>

2148
01:29:37.351 --> 01:29:39.720
<v Speaker 4>There is something to take from it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying it's going to change your</v>

2149
01:29:39.721 --> 01:29:42.450
<v Speaker 4>life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I mean even some of the dumbest,</v>

2150
01:29:42.451 --> 01:29:47.451
<v Speaker 4>worst shit that's ever come my way and </v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes I just get good material out </v>

2151
01:29:47.451 --> 01:29:50.211
<v Speaker 4>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just fucking started ripping on </v>

2152
01:29:50.211 --> 01:29:50.211
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>

2153
01:29:50.211 --> 01:29:50.211
<v Speaker 4>and it's hilarious and it's still serve </v>
<v Speaker 4>me a purpose.</v>

2154
01:29:50.211 --> 01:29:51.180
<v Speaker 4>I still got something out of it</v>

2155
01:29:51.220 --> 01:29:56.220
<v Speaker 2>and it definitely does broaden your </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding of the possibility of </v>

2156
01:29:56.220 --> 01:29:59.800
<v Speaker 2>human behavior and you learn a lot about</v>
<v Speaker 2>like why people act the way they act.</v>

2157
01:29:59.801 --> 01:30:04.801
<v Speaker 2>And here's the big one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Haters like people who are really </v>

2158
01:30:04.801 --> 01:30:08.260
<v Speaker 2>douchey or all failures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's 100 percent across the board.</v>

2159
01:30:08.440 --> 01:30:12.400
<v Speaker 2>No one who is truly brilliant at </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything is a hater.</v>

2160
01:30:12.490 --> 01:30:16.000
<v Speaker 2>They're just not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They might be a few jealous like sports.</v>

2161
01:30:16.350 --> 01:30:18.480
<v Speaker 4>They are a hater.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not going to go out publicly and</v>

2162
01:30:18.620 --> 01:30:19.050
<v Speaker 4>I hate her.</v>

2163
01:30:19.150 --> 01:30:24.150
<v Speaker 2>Well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I mean to be truly excellent at </v>

2164
01:30:24.150 --> 01:30:24.400
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be concentrating on yourself</v>

2165
01:30:24.401 --> 01:30:28.060
<v Speaker 2>and positive shit and you can't be </v>
<v Speaker 2>worrying about shooting somebody down or</v>

2166
01:30:28.061 --> 01:30:31.600
<v Speaker 2>chipping too many down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like you are taking the opinions,</v>

2167
01:30:31.601 --> 01:30:36.601
<v Speaker 2>like if you're one of those guys that </v>
<v Speaker 2>gets in battles with haters a lot of </v>

2168
01:30:36.601 --> 01:30:36.601
<v Speaker 2>time online,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2169
01:30:36.601 --> 01:30:40.261
<v Speaker 2>you could do it for fun if you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what you're doing essentially is </v>

2170
01:30:40.261 --> 01:30:42.931
<v Speaker 2>you're arguing with like some of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>biggest failures as a human being that </v>

2171
01:30:42.931 --> 01:30:42.931
<v Speaker 2>exists usually</v>

2172
01:30:42.931 --> 01:30:44.070
<v Speaker 4>person that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2173
01:30:44.080 --> 01:30:44.630
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2174
01:30:44.680 --> 01:30:49.680
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just gonna drop out of high school </v>

2175
01:30:49.680 --> 01:30:49.680
<v Speaker 4>and get my ged and graduated early.</v>

2176
01:30:49.680 --> 01:30:50.830
<v Speaker 2>That person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's if you're lucky.</v>

2177
01:30:51.040 --> 01:30:52.870
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But even if they have a job somewhere,</v>

2178
01:30:52.871 --> 01:30:54.140
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're,</v>

2179
01:30:54.141 --> 01:30:57.220
<v Speaker 2>you're socially unsuccessful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there was that guy that was,</v>

2180
01:30:57.640 --> 01:30:59.530
<v Speaker 2>he lost his job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's his name?</v>

2181
01:30:59.531 --> 01:31:00.700
<v Speaker 2>Brian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm talking about?</v>

2182
01:31:00.701 --> 01:31:04.020
<v Speaker 2>The reddit guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was responsible for like someone like</v>

2183
01:31:04.030 --> 01:31:06.880
<v Speaker 2>the most heinous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucked up shit on reddit.com.</v>

2184
01:31:07.110 --> 01:31:12.110
<v Speaker 2>Like yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like underage girls like suggested </v>

2185
01:31:12.110 --> 01:31:16.300
<v Speaker 2>positions and like some dark shit and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was like really rude online.</v>

2186
01:31:16.301 --> 01:31:19.030
<v Speaker 2>Well they found out his name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they went out and they got them and they</v>

2187
01:31:19.031 --> 01:31:24.031
<v Speaker 2>contacted his employer and then they got</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy fired and then he was on some </v>

2188
01:31:24.031 --> 01:31:28.051
<v Speaker 2>television show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of defending it saying this is a </v>

2189
01:31:28.051 --> 01:31:28.470
<v Speaker 2>character that he plays online and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it gives them freedom or it's</v>

2190
01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:29.970
<v Speaker 4>too far.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's bullshit.</v>

2191
01:31:29.971 --> 01:31:34.971
<v Speaker 4>Like you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't care if it's a character you </v>

2192
01:31:34.971 --> 01:31:34.971
<v Speaker 4>even when you're just reading a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 4>texts,</v>

2193
01:31:34.971 --> 01:31:37.240
<v Speaker 4>like you can't tell who's a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>character or not and,</v>

2194
01:31:37.410 --> 01:31:42.410
<v Speaker 4>and there's no way to interpret that </v>
<v Speaker 4>when Andy Kaufman goes on stage and no </v>

2195
01:31:42.410 --> 01:31:45.990
<v Speaker 4>matter what crazy shit he was doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he wasn't out there trying to,</v>

2196
01:31:46.050 --> 01:31:50.130
<v Speaker 4>to really fuck up people's lives.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you maybe you show up at a show and</v>

2197
01:31:50.131 --> 01:31:51.390
<v Speaker 4>he sings,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2198
01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:54.670
<v Speaker 4>a cartoon theme songs or actually he </v>
<v Speaker 4>just lip syncs.</v>

2199
01:31:54.671 --> 01:31:56.010
<v Speaker 4>So the whole time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2200
01:31:56.280 --> 01:32:01.280
<v Speaker 4>you're mad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You may as you spent your money to go </v>

2201
01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:01.280
<v Speaker 4>see it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he didn't ruin your fucking</v>

2202
01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:04.980
<v Speaker 6>life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He didn't cause you some sort of a </v>

2203
01:32:04.980 --> 01:32:04.980
<v Speaker 6>difficulty.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He didn't do something and it's like,</v>

2204
01:32:04.980 --> 01:32:05.740
<v Speaker 6>Fuck Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what?</v>

2205
01:32:05.741 --> 01:32:06.130

<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2206
01:32:06.160 --> 01:32:09.790
<v Speaker 6>he didn't impact you in such a negative </v>
<v Speaker 6>way that made you want to kill them.</v>

2207
01:32:09.950 --> 01:32:11.630
<v Speaker 6>And there's there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there used to be a,</v>

2208
01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:13.220
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>an mma for them.</v>

2209
01:32:13.330 --> 01:32:15.040
<v Speaker 6>The same thing that fight sport.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>

2210
01:32:15.041 --> 01:32:16.030
<v Speaker 6>I remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They would just,</v>

2211
01:32:16.390 --> 01:32:18.380
<v Speaker 6>everything was just nothing but </v>
<v Speaker 6>negativity,</v>

2212
01:32:18.381 --> 01:32:19.370
<v Speaker 6>negativity,</v>
<v Speaker 6>negativity,</v>

2213
01:32:19.380 --> 01:32:23.110
<v Speaker 6>just horrible as shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There'd be people at portraying or maybe</v>

2214
01:32:23.380 --> 01:32:27.040
<v Speaker 6>for real,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a racist personalities.</v>

2215
01:32:27.041 --> 01:32:32.041
<v Speaker 6>There'd be people digging up stuff on </v>
<v Speaker 6>other and just all of it was just to be </v>

2216
01:32:32.041 --> 01:32:34.540
<v Speaker 6>nothing but to be horrible to each other</v>
<v Speaker 6>and the other fighters and people.</v>

2217
01:32:34.541 --> 01:32:35.410
<v Speaker 6>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fuck,</v>

2218
01:32:35.411 --> 01:32:35.930
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>why?</v>

2219
01:32:35.931 --> 01:32:37.990
<v Speaker 6>Why live your life that way?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why spend all that energy?</v>

2220
01:32:37.991 --> 01:32:40.890
<v Speaker 6>And truly at the end of the day you </v>
<v Speaker 6>haven't gotten anywhere like you,</v>

2221
01:32:41.080 --> 01:32:42.370
<v Speaker 6>you've just been swimming in place.</v>

2222
01:32:42.370 --> 01:32:46.810
<v Speaker 6>You haven't improved your life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You haven't gotten any further along and</v>

2223
01:32:46.870 --> 01:32:49.180
<v Speaker 6>trying to accomplish something for </v>
<v Speaker 6>yourself at all.</v>

2224
01:32:49.300 --> 01:32:50.590
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>most of them are 12,</v>

2225
01:32:51.040 --> 01:32:52.130
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sad,</v>

2226
01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:54.580
<v Speaker 6>sad,</v>
<v Speaker 6>part of some of those are 30 to 20.</v>

2227
01:32:54.690 --> 01:32:57.640
<v Speaker 6>Maybe even 50 and this guy who got </v>
<v Speaker 6>caught,</v>

2228
01:32:57.641 --> 01:33:00.430
<v Speaker 6>the reddit guy who was a guy who had </v>
<v Speaker 6>children.</v>

2229
01:33:00.460 --> 01:33:01.750
<v Speaker 6>See why,</v>
<v Speaker 6>why would you,</v>

2230
01:33:01.751 --> 01:33:03.340
<v Speaker 6>why spend?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because there's,</v>

2231
01:33:03.450 --> 01:33:05.980
<v Speaker 6>there's clearly,</v>
<v Speaker 6>clearly there's something lacking in his</v>

2232
01:33:05.981 --> 01:33:06.960
<v Speaker 6>life,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2233
01:33:07.030 --> 01:33:12.030
<v Speaker 6>socially somehow that he never came to </v>
<v Speaker 6>grips with and he's using this anonymity</v>

2234
01:33:12.850 --> 01:33:17.850
<v Speaker 6>to do this and it's just that they have </v>
<v Speaker 6>a voice that didn't exist in the past </v>

2235
01:33:18.131 --> 01:33:19.900
<v Speaker 6>and in the past they were the person </v>
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

2236
01:33:19.960 --> 01:33:22.540
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when they would be dealt with socially,</v>

2237
01:33:22.541 --> 01:33:25.360
<v Speaker 6>like in a one on one situation,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if they ever said anything,</v>

2238
01:33:25.450 --> 01:33:27.430
<v Speaker 6>anything remotely route,</v>
<v Speaker 6>everybody will be like,</v>

2239
01:33:27.431 --> 01:33:28.720
<v Speaker 6>fuck you stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Look at you.</v>

2240
01:33:28.720 --> 01:33:29.920
<v Speaker 6>You'd dump fat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fuck.</v>

2241
01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:31.900
<v Speaker 6>And they'd be shot down.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It will be over,</v>

2242
01:33:32.080 --> 01:33:35.760
<v Speaker 6>but they can lash out at you without any</v>
<v Speaker 6>fields of social repercussions.</v>

2243
01:33:35.780 --> 01:33:40.000
<v Speaker 6>Just brought something really that </v>
<v Speaker 6>really just went off in my head.</v>

2244
01:33:40.270 --> 01:33:41.680
<v Speaker 6>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Joe Comedian.</v>

2245
01:33:41.920 --> 01:33:46.920
<v Speaker 6>Yes sir.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Comedians throw out heinous shit </v>

2246
01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:50.161
<v Speaker 6>sometimes you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but jokes are jokes are jokes and you </v>

2247
01:33:50.161 --> 01:33:50.161
<v Speaker 6>fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

2248
01:33:50.161 --> 01:33:50.161
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

2249
01:33:50.161 --> 01:33:51.160
<v Speaker 6>you throw as you give out as much as you</v>
<v Speaker 6>got.</v>

2250
01:33:51.161 --> 01:33:54.910
<v Speaker 6>But that's the only way that you can </v>
<v Speaker 6>throw out as much as you got,</v>

2251
01:33:55.310 --> 01:33:57.490
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in terms of being a comedian and pushing</v>

2252
01:33:57.491 --> 01:34:02.491
<v Speaker 6>boundaries and saying crazy shit </v>
<v Speaker 6>sometimes whatever is because you will </v>

2253
01:34:02.491 --> 01:34:03.490
<v Speaker 6>need to take as much as you get.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's the difference there.</v>

2254
01:34:03.540 --> 01:34:08.540
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>don't go out there and say some rude </v>

2255
01:34:08.540 --> 01:34:10.771
<v Speaker 6>shit even if you're trying,</v>
<v Speaker 6>even if you're doing the right thing to </v>

2256
01:34:10.771 --> 01:34:13.891
<v Speaker 6>go out and stand up and say something </v>
<v Speaker 6>that is against somebody else or some </v>

2257
01:34:13.891 --> 01:34:18.841
<v Speaker 6>other groups are because even if it's </v>
<v Speaker 6>the wrong thing that they're doing and </v>

2258
01:34:18.841 --> 01:34:20.570
<v Speaker 6>you need to stand up as some sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2259
01:34:20.610 --> 01:34:23.980
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>avatar against it because it's the wrong</v>

2260
01:34:23.981 --> 01:34:24.670
<v Speaker 6>fucking thing.</v>

2261
01:34:24.670 --> 01:34:29.670
<v Speaker 6>It's not good to do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That means you have to be willing to </v>

2262
01:34:29.670 --> 01:34:30.760
<v Speaker 6>accept every negative thing that's going</v>
<v Speaker 6>to come with that and be okay with that.</v>

2263
01:34:30.820 --> 01:34:31.690
<v Speaker 6>And be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2264
01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:36.840
<v Speaker 6>to do,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to go out there and stand up for the </v>

2265
01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:36.840
<v Speaker 6>right thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Something shitty might come my way.</v>

2266
01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:41.551
<v Speaker 6>But this is something that must be done.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And even if in a social scenario of </v>

2267
01:34:41.551 --> 01:34:41.551
<v Speaker 6>your,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

2268
01:34:41.551 --> 01:34:41.890
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to where everyone's a pot </v>
<v Speaker 6>shouting each other,</v>

2269
01:34:41.891 --> 01:34:42.400
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

2270
01:34:42.401 --> 01:34:42.880
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and it's,</v>

2271
01:34:42.910 --> 01:34:45.490
<v Speaker 6>it's fun,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but to say something,</v>

2272
01:34:46.180 --> 01:34:47.770
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to insult somebody else,</v>

2273
01:34:47.771 --> 01:34:52.771
<v Speaker 6>even in a fun and adjust way,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can't do it if you can't fucking </v>

2274
01:34:52.771 --> 01:34:53.350
<v Speaker 6>take it because we've all known those </v>
<v Speaker 6>people were all fucking around,</v>

2275
01:34:53.351 --> 01:34:56.380
<v Speaker 6>were saying horrible shit to each other </v>
<v Speaker 6>and somebody chimes in and,</v>

2276
01:34:56.390 --> 01:34:56.750
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

2277
01:34:56.810 --> 01:35:01.810
<v Speaker 6>and that's what's funny is there's </v>
<v Speaker 6>always a change in tone when that guy </v>

2278
01:35:01.810 --> 01:35:04.010
<v Speaker 6>does it from everybody's response to </v>
<v Speaker 6>them because you can,</v>

2279
01:35:04.011 --> 01:35:09.011
<v Speaker 6>it's like you can feel the shit that </v>
<v Speaker 6>they're saying and not being able to </v>

2280
01:35:09.011 --> 01:35:09.920
<v Speaker 6>take it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And the place they're coming from,</v>

2281
01:35:09.921 --> 01:35:10.560
<v Speaker 6>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>

2282
01:35:10.570 --> 01:35:15.570
<v Speaker 6>it could come out their mouth the same,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but there's a different energy and if </v>

2283
01:35:15.570 --> 01:35:16.460
<v Speaker 6>you turn to them and then you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fuck you,</v>

2284
01:35:16.461 --> 01:35:17.930
<v Speaker 6>you piece of shit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>shut the fuck up.</v>

2285
01:35:18.170 --> 01:35:19.730
<v Speaker 6>And it changes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

2286
01:35:19.731 --> 01:35:21.240
<v Speaker 6>it's different between you and me </v>
<v Speaker 6>riffing on it.</v>

2287
01:35:21.290 --> 01:35:23.120
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's serious.</v>

2288
01:35:23.121 --> 01:35:28.121
<v Speaker 2>And it was just joking around with </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody else as long as he was </v>

2289
01:35:28.121 --> 01:35:28.121
<v Speaker 2>involved in the joking.</v>

2290
01:35:28.121 --> 01:35:28.150
<v Speaker 6>But we realized,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's like you,</v>

2291
01:35:28.230 --> 01:35:31.200
<v Speaker 6>you can read,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can you realize that when they throw</v>

2292
01:35:31.201 --> 01:35:36.201
<v Speaker 6>out that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they can't take it either and so they </v>

2293
01:35:36.201 --> 01:35:36.960
<v Speaker 6>shouldn't really be participating </v>
<v Speaker 6>because there just isn't,</v>

2294
01:35:36.990 --> 01:35:38.070
<v Speaker 6>isn't in the same vein.</v>

2295
01:35:38.080 --> 01:35:43.080
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what the thing about being able </v>

2296
01:35:43.080 --> 01:35:43.080
<v Speaker 2>to hate on someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially a public person,</v>

2297
01:35:43.080 --> 01:35:45.670
<v Speaker 2>like a Josh Barnett type character,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is your apparently wonderful to do</v>

2298
01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:48.640
<v Speaker 2>your anonymous because if you're just </v>
<v Speaker 2>some anonymous person,</v>

2299
01:35:48.641 --> 01:35:52.660
<v Speaker 2>you have no repercussions whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know so much about you.</v>

2300
01:35:52.780 --> 01:35:54.790
<v Speaker 2>They know what your look like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They know the fights you've had.</v>

2301
01:35:54.800 --> 01:35:59.800
<v Speaker 2>Like I was watching some battle on </v>
<v Speaker 2>twitter or whatever the fuck it was.</v>

2302
01:36:00.191 --> 01:36:05.191
<v Speaker 2>I was reading on an mma site was Josh </v>
<v Speaker 2>Thompson was arguing with this guy and </v>

2303
01:36:05.191 --> 01:36:07.840
<v Speaker 2>the guy who was bringing up like me and </v>
<v Speaker 2>my friends,</v>

2304
01:36:07.841 --> 01:36:11.410
<v Speaker 2>we laughed out loud watching you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kayo by Eve's Edwards,</v>

2305
01:36:11.590 --> 01:36:14.110
<v Speaker 2>please fight again so we can laugh again</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you get knocked out.</v>

2306
01:36:14.111 --> 01:36:15.810
<v Speaker 2>And I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm why I'm like this.</v>

2307
01:36:15.811 --> 01:36:20.811
<v Speaker 2>This piece of shit like that is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>weakest and move of as a human being to </v>

2308
01:36:21.041 --> 01:36:23.870
<v Speaker 2>go after what you know her to guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2309
01:36:23.900 --> 01:36:25.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a devastating loss.</v>

2310
01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:27.000
<v Speaker 2>The goal to go after that when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

2311
01:36:27.190 --> 01:36:30.610
<v Speaker 2>when you haven't done anything yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone that put it out there.</v>

2312
01:36:30.710 --> 01:36:35.710
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they expose themselves to all the glory </v>

2313
01:36:35.710 --> 01:36:38.321
<v Speaker 6>and all the.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All the sadness and difficulty of </v>

2314
01:36:38.321 --> 01:36:40.520
<v Speaker 6>defeat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He went and dared to do it and you don't</v>

2315
01:36:40.521 --> 01:36:45.521
<v Speaker 6>dare to do anything besides sit behind </v>
<v Speaker 6>an anonymous thing and and and really </v>

2316
01:36:45.521 --> 01:36:46.970
<v Speaker 6>accomplished nothing and try to take </v>
<v Speaker 6>shots at somebody who went out there and</v>

2317
01:36:46.971 --> 01:36:51.971
<v Speaker 6>tried who were not there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Try went to excel and put himself in a </v>

2318
01:36:51.971 --> 01:36:55.541
<v Speaker 6>position where it's precarious and it's </v>
<v Speaker 6>difficult and there's no guarantees and </v>

2319
01:36:55.541 --> 01:36:59.081
<v Speaker 6>he knew that and he knew that everyone </v>
<v Speaker 6>would watch it and he and you also know </v>

2320
01:36:59.081 --> 01:36:59.750
<v Speaker 6>as a fire,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you go out there and you lose.</v>

2321
01:36:59.960 --> 01:37:04.960
<v Speaker 6>You're opening yourself up to all of </v>
<v Speaker 6>that for people to come out there and </v>

2322
01:37:04.960 --> 01:37:07.430
<v Speaker 6>use that as a weapon against you because</v>
<v Speaker 6>of their shitty a personality.</v>

2323
01:37:07.431 --> 01:37:08.180
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>exactly.</v>

2324
01:37:08.181 --> 01:37:09.860
<v Speaker 6>And so to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to do that,</v>

2325
01:37:09.861 --> 01:37:14.861
<v Speaker 6>it's fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we of course don't argue with them </v>

2326
01:37:14.861 --> 01:37:17.051
<v Speaker 6>because they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no one's paying attention to what the </v>

2327
01:37:17.051 --> 01:37:17.051
<v Speaker 6>fuck they have to say anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So when you respond,</v>

2328
01:37:17.051 --> 01:37:18.950
<v Speaker 6>you give them exactly what they're </v>
<v Speaker 6>looking for.</v>

2329
01:37:19.300 --> 01:37:19.410
<v Speaker 6>Now.</v>

2330
01:37:19.850 --> 01:37:20.450
<v Speaker 2>Important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2331
01:37:20.451 --> 01:37:21.050
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2332
01:37:21.051 --> 01:37:23.240
<v Speaker 2>I also think that this is not gonna </v>
<v Speaker 2>last.</v>

2333
01:37:23.510 --> 01:37:26.620
<v Speaker 2>I think this is an error in humanity </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we're going to figure out.</v>

2334
01:37:26.621 --> 01:37:28.440
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's already been too long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2335
01:37:28.620 --> 01:37:29.300
<v Speaker 6>kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't.</v>

2336
01:37:29.301 --> 01:37:31.200
<v Speaker 6>I don't know when it's gonna end,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if it does end</v>

2337
01:37:31.320 --> 01:37:33.480
<v Speaker 2>well it sort of already has with this </v>
<v Speaker 2>reddit guy.</v>

2338
01:37:33.540 --> 01:37:34.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2339
01:37:34.171 --> 01:37:36.330
<v Speaker 2>they can track you down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can find out who the fuck you are.</v>

2340
01:37:36.331 --> 01:37:38.960
<v Speaker 2>If somebody is decently motivated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2341
01:37:38.970 --> 01:37:41.490
<v Speaker 2>for guys like you or I or Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2342
01:37:41.491 --> 01:37:41.810
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2343
01:37:41.811 --> 01:37:42.280
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2344
01:37:42.390 --> 01:37:46.110
<v Speaker 2>you get a certain amount of access to </v>
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>

2345
01:37:46.140 --> 01:37:47.250
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're on twitter,</v>

2346
01:37:47.251 --> 01:37:48.900

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2347
01:37:48.901 --> 01:37:51.090
<v Speaker 2>people can write threads on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>underground,</v>

2348
01:37:51.091 --> 01:37:51.990
<v Speaker 2>you're going to read them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2349
01:37:52.040 --> 01:37:57.040
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a certain amount of access and </v>

2350
01:37:57.040 --> 01:37:57.040
<v Speaker 2>the Brian</v>

2351
01:37:57.040 --> 01:37:57.910
<v Speaker 6>though they should be.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah,</v>

2352
01:37:57.911 --> 01:37:58.630
<v Speaker 6>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Definitely.</v>

2353
01:37:58.631 --> 01:37:59.250
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

2354
01:37:59.340 --> 01:38:02.080
<v Speaker 2>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a certain amount of,</v>

2355
01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:03.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2356
01:38:03.061 --> 01:38:08.061
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're used to it and you can deal with </v>

2357
01:38:08.061 --> 01:38:08.061
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when it comes on them,</v>

2358
01:38:08.061 --> 01:38:11.400
<v Speaker 2>when all of a sudden their real name is </v>
<v Speaker 2>exposed and their employer is like,</v>

2359
01:38:11.401 --> 01:38:13.500
<v Speaker 2>all the sudden it's like whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they realize like,</v>

2360
01:38:13.501 --> 01:38:14.260
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2361
01:38:14.270 --> 01:38:15.990
<v Speaker 2>you're in an ever changing game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

2362
01:38:15.991 --> 01:38:20.991
<v Speaker 2>and this anonymity that might've enjoyed</v>
<v Speaker 2>two years ago really doesn't exist </v>

2363
01:38:20.991 --> 01:38:24.201
<v Speaker 2>anymore and guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>In a year from now and be able to read </v>

2364
01:38:24.201 --> 01:38:24.201
<v Speaker 2>your thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

2365
01:38:24.201 --> 01:38:24.201
<v Speaker 2>so keep it together,</v>

2366
01:38:24.390 --> 01:38:29.390
<v Speaker 6>keep it together and taking all this </v>
<v Speaker 6>stuff from onnit Dotcom that may even </v>

2367
01:38:29.390 --> 01:38:29.390
<v Speaker 6>come sooner</v>

2368
01:38:30.110 --> 01:38:35.110
<v Speaker 2>to be a better person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You fuckhead and that's what people </v>

2369
01:38:35.110 --> 01:38:35.110
<v Speaker 2>don't understand.</v>

2370
01:38:35.110 --> 01:38:39.520
<v Speaker 6>They aren't trying to be better people </v>
<v Speaker 6>and that is what's killing this country </v>

2371
01:38:39.520 --> 01:38:41.060
<v Speaker 6>as it is people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the human race period,</v>

2372
01:38:41.090 --> 01:38:46.090
<v Speaker 6>the human race period and it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But it varies from place and I think </v>

2373
01:38:46.090 --> 01:38:47.060
<v Speaker 6>here in America we have a very specific </v>
<v Speaker 6>case.</v>

2374
01:38:47.061 --> 01:38:48.230
<v Speaker 6>Like I'm saying that it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

2375
01:38:48.231 --> 01:38:53.231
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it is specific to us as Americans have </v>

2376
01:38:53.231 --> 01:38:56.860
<v Speaker 6>the way we use our technology,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the way that we are progressing or </v>

2377
01:38:56.860 --> 01:38:57.710
<v Speaker 6>regressing as individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>

2378
01:38:57.910 --> 01:39:00.530
<v Speaker 6>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's this huge concept of uh,</v>

2379
01:39:00.590 --> 01:39:05.590
<v Speaker 6>so,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so one thing about people talking shit </v>

2380
01:39:05.590 --> 01:39:05.590
<v Speaker 6>about folks is that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2381
01:39:05.590 --> 01:39:06.800
<v Speaker 6>of course that is the anonymity,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but there's also this prevalent attitude</v>

2382
01:39:06.801 --> 01:39:11.801
<v Speaker 6>that I can go out there and be as much </v>
<v Speaker 6>of an asshole as I want because you're </v>

2383
01:39:11.801 --> 01:39:12.230
<v Speaker 6>not going to do anything about it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can't beat me up.</v>

2384
01:39:12.231 --> 01:39:17.231
<v Speaker 6>You can't just fight me like nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like nobody actually thinks that </v>

2385
01:39:17.231 --> 01:39:17.231
<v Speaker 6>anything will happen.</v>

2386
01:39:17.231 --> 01:39:18.530
<v Speaker 6>But oh well I'll sue you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You should be able to you.</v>

2387
01:39:18.620 --> 01:39:20.810
<v Speaker 6>If someone talks shit to you and your a </v>
<v Speaker 6>problem and may fire,</v>

2388
01:39:20.820 --> 01:39:23.250
<v Speaker 6>you should at least be able to bitch </v>
<v Speaker 6>slap them a little bit.</v>

2389
01:39:23.330 --> 01:39:24.230
<v Speaker 6>Totally legal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

2390
01:39:24.290 --> 01:39:25.820
<v Speaker 6>and my thing is like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>even if,</v>

2391
01:39:25.821 --> 01:39:30.821
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you're being outwardly with so many </v>

2392
01:39:30.821 --> 01:39:32.780
<v Speaker 6>people lack common courtesy anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just the smallest things.</v>

2393
01:39:32.781 --> 01:39:37.781
<v Speaker 6>And if you do something that is </v>
<v Speaker 6>discourteous in a public manner and you </v>

2394
01:39:37.781 --> 01:39:39.890
<v Speaker 6>upset somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well most people just fucking take it.</v>

2395
01:39:40.280 --> 01:39:41.510
<v Speaker 6>But if someone goes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>

2396
01:39:41.900 --> 01:39:43.300
<v Speaker 6>fuck you for doing x,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Y,</v>

2397
01:39:43.330 --> 01:39:44.480
<v Speaker 6>Z,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's not cool.</v>

2398
01:39:45.050 --> 01:39:47.180
<v Speaker 6>Instead of someone being like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all right,</v>

2399
01:39:47.240 --> 01:39:48.650
<v Speaker 6>either a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm sorry,</v>

2400
01:39:48.651 --> 01:39:50.150
<v Speaker 6>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That was fucked up.</v>

2401
01:39:50.151 --> 01:39:51.530
<v Speaker 6>I shouldn't have done that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you know,</v>

2402
01:39:51.650 --> 01:39:54.680
<v Speaker 6>waking up a or b being like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know what,</v>

2403
01:39:54.681 --> 01:39:55.700
<v Speaker 6>fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm just an asshole.</v>

2404
01:39:55.701 --> 01:39:57.350
<v Speaker 6>So let's fight and dealing with it.</v>

2405
01:39:57.350 --> 01:39:59.960
<v Speaker 6>And then let's say they get their ass </v>
<v Speaker 6>beat and then they go about their way.</v>

2406
01:40:00.310 --> 01:40:00.810
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2407
01:40:00.811 --> 01:40:01.700
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's always like,</v>

2408
01:40:01.940 --> 01:40:04.290
<v Speaker 6>they just keep pushing that barrier </v>
<v Speaker 6>because that boundary.</v>

2409
01:40:04.291 --> 01:40:09.291
<v Speaker 6>But,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and crossing that line because they </v>

2410
01:40:09.291 --> 01:40:09.291
<v Speaker 6>think you can do anything about it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can't just,</v>

2411
01:40:09.291 --> 01:40:10.430
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>use freedom of speech.</v>

2412
01:40:10.431 --> 01:40:11.930
<v Speaker 6>I can be as much of a dickhead as I </v>
<v Speaker 6>want,</v>

2413
01:40:11.931 --> 01:40:13.040
<v Speaker 6>as long as they don't do anything to </v>
<v Speaker 6>you.</v>

2414
01:40:13.041 --> 01:40:14.420
<v Speaker 6>And it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fine.</v>

2415
01:40:14.900 --> 01:40:15.890
<v Speaker 6>And I've,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've had,</v>

2416
01:40:15.950 --> 01:40:18.710
<v Speaker 6>usually it is these things where I've </v>
<v Speaker 6>had,</v>

2417
01:40:18.740 --> 01:40:20.450
<v Speaker 6>where it's happened to me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've turned to him and I,</v>

2418
01:40:20.451 --> 01:40:22.700
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I tell them like in a movie theater,</v>

2419
01:40:22.701 --> 01:40:24.480
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking cell phone and the on the,</v>

2420
01:40:24.481 --> 01:40:26.850
<v Speaker 6>on the cell phone talking on it in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>middle of the movie theater,</v>

2421
01:40:26.851 --> 01:40:27.690
<v Speaker 6>I had to turn around.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I go,</v>

2422
01:40:27.691 --> 01:40:29.960
<v Speaker 6>are you fucking on your phone in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>middle of a movie?</v>

2423
01:40:30.020 --> 01:40:30.830
<v Speaker 6>Fucking kidding me.</v>

2424
01:40:30.830 --> 01:40:35.830
<v Speaker 6>And I looked at him and go get off that </v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking phone right now I'm a breaker </v>

2425
01:40:35.830 --> 01:40:38.140
<v Speaker 6>and a half and shove it up your ass.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I say that because I slept.</v>

2426
01:40:38.170 --> 01:40:39.830
<v Speaker 6>Someone would say in a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well there's that.</v>

2427
01:40:39.860 --> 01:40:42.590
<v Speaker 6>But also it's very appropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's very clinical.</v>

2428
01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:44.330
<v Speaker 6>When I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I tried,</v>

2429
01:40:44.331 --> 01:40:49.331
<v Speaker 6>I pride myself on being.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If I say some shit like that after I've </v>

2430
01:40:49.641 --> 01:40:52.640
<v Speaker 6>said it during no turning back.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And if I say I'm going to do it,</v>

2431
01:40:52.641 --> 01:40:55.550
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to fucking do it because </v>
<v Speaker 6>otherwise my word is meaningless.</v>

2432
01:40:55.580 --> 01:40:58.010
<v Speaker 6>But you really shove it up their ass.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You might shove it up there.</v>

2433
01:40:58.011 --> 01:41:00.170
<v Speaker 6>I would break them a little,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a bad baby.</v>

2434
01:41:00.200 --> 01:41:01.730
<v Speaker 6>Throw them across the chair,</v>
<v Speaker 6>maybe.</v>

2435
01:41:01.731 --> 01:41:02.630
<v Speaker 6>I Dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but yeah,</v>

2436
01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:07.640
<v Speaker 6>I just went limp though.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You probably just scream and pick them </v>

2437
01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:07.640
<v Speaker 6>up and shake them them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2438
01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:09.680
<v Speaker 6>if they just went lamp,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they just completely fetal position.</v>

2439
01:41:09.681 --> 01:41:11.060
<v Speaker 6>I'd take that phone,</v>
<v Speaker 6>break it,</v>

2440
01:41:11.061 --> 01:41:16.061
<v Speaker 6>slam it on the phone,</v>
<v Speaker 6>tell him what a piece of shit they were </v>

2441
01:41:16.061 --> 01:41:16.061
<v Speaker 6>and they let it go.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But that's your move folks.</v>

2442
01:41:16.061 --> 01:41:17.450
<v Speaker 6>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you got to go limp.</v>

2443
01:41:18.380 --> 01:41:20.900
<v Speaker 6>Just go limp.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And if you can start crying,</v>

2444
01:41:21.350 --> 01:41:23.270
<v Speaker 6>just crying.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I go limp all the time.</v>

2445
01:41:23.271 --> 01:41:28.271
<v Speaker 6>It's that after I'm done.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh happens buddy.</v>

2446
01:41:30.150 --> 01:41:35.150
<v Speaker 2>I think this is a very important subject</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I love that you brought it up and I </v>

2447
01:41:35.150 --> 01:41:36.180
<v Speaker 2>think um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a,</v>

2448
01:41:36.181 --> 01:41:36.800
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

2449
01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:40.410
<v Speaker 2>a really important subject for the young</v>
<v Speaker 2>men,</v>

2450
01:41:40.411 --> 01:41:43.760
<v Speaker 2>especially of this era that are growing </v>
<v Speaker 2>up now.</v>

2451
01:41:43.800 --> 01:41:47.190
<v Speaker 2>Just being forced fed video games and </v>
<v Speaker 2>not having any character</v>

2452
01:41:47.270 --> 01:41:50.290
<v Speaker 6>to build it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They just leave the kid with the eye,</v>

2453
01:41:50.310 --> 01:41:53.680
<v Speaker 6>the portable portable gaming system.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you know what?</v>

2454
01:41:53.780 --> 01:41:58.780
<v Speaker 6>I Love Games.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I gained a lot when I was a kid and I </v>

2455
01:41:58.780 --> 01:41:58.780
<v Speaker 6>loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But guess what?</v>

2456
01:41:58.780 --> 01:42:00.140
<v Speaker 6>When I'm out with my parents or I'm at </v>
<v Speaker 6>family functions,</v>

2457
01:42:00.141 --> 01:42:05.141
<v Speaker 6>when I'm not sitting in a corner </v>
<v Speaker 6>completely buried into some electronics </v>

2458
01:42:05.141 --> 01:42:05.750
<v Speaker 6>the whole time being like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fuck that.</v>

2459
01:42:05.751 --> 01:42:07.400
<v Speaker 6>Like you can't let your kid do that </v>
<v Speaker 6>shit.</v>

2460
01:42:07.630 --> 01:42:07.930
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2461
01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:12.850
<v Speaker 2>definitely doesn't teach them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't raise a good human skills,</v>

2462
01:42:12.970 --> 01:42:17.970
<v Speaker 2>but the mind what what concerns me is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the lack of character building things.</v>

2463
01:42:18.221 --> 01:42:20.560
<v Speaker 2>If you're not involved in some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>athletics,</v>

2464
01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:25.570
<v Speaker 2>then to me if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's either that or some other difficult</v>

2465
01:42:25.571 --> 01:42:30.571
<v Speaker 2>intellectual pursuit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's something that has to </v>

2466
01:42:30.571 --> 01:42:30.571
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

2467
01:42:30.571 --> 01:42:30.800
<v Speaker 6>They need to suffer being being,</v>
<v Speaker 6>being made to,</v>

2468
01:42:30.810 --> 01:42:32.060
<v Speaker 6>to have some,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2469
01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:33.390
<v Speaker 6>a push.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2470
01:42:33.690 --> 01:42:37.800
<v Speaker 2>To be able to realize that you will fail</v>
<v Speaker 2>and learn from the failures.</v>

2471
01:42:37.801 --> 01:42:38.750
<v Speaker 2>Objective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lee,</v>

2472
01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:43.880
<v Speaker 2>one of the most important things you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could ever learn as a man is how you </v>

2473
01:42:43.880 --> 01:42:46.881
<v Speaker 2>fucked up and how not to fuck up again </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you understand the pain of </v>

2474
01:42:46.881 --> 01:42:48.040
<v Speaker 2>fucking up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the saddest thing to it too,</v>

2475
01:42:48.270 --> 01:42:50.280
<v Speaker 2>and one of the saddest things is when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you see rich kids,</v>

2476
01:42:50.580 --> 01:42:55.580
<v Speaker 2>kids that grow up with no character and </v>
<v Speaker 2>no one ever tells them what to do with </v>

2477
01:42:55.580 --> 01:42:55.580
<v Speaker 2>fucking up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2478
01:42:55.580 --> 01:42:56.700
<v Speaker 2>they got to cook all their life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That takes.</v>

2479
01:42:57.310 --> 01:43:02.310
<v Speaker 6>Here's the other one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They don't understand that the reason </v>

2480
01:43:02.310 --> 01:43:04.950
<v Speaker 6>that they're able to create a business </v>
<v Speaker 6>doing this or do that or have all this </v>

2481
01:43:04.950 --> 01:43:08.731
<v Speaker 6>little successful shit running around </v>
<v Speaker 6>them is because they had all the </v>

2482
01:43:08.731 --> 01:43:12.301
<v Speaker 6>facilities to do it in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They didn't have to strive and struggle </v>

2483
01:43:12.301 --> 01:43:12.301
<v Speaker 6>and fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2484
01:43:12.301 --> 01:43:12.580
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you fuck up.</v>

2485
01:43:12.581 --> 01:43:14.680
<v Speaker 6>I've got money to cover that fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

2486
01:43:14.740 --> 01:43:15.910
<v Speaker 6>dummies.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Who were proud of that</v>

2487
01:43:15.930 --> 01:43:20.930
<v Speaker 2>be from America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they did something to one to one </v>

2488
01:43:20.930 --> 01:43:24.181
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We proud to be from America because we </v>

2489
01:43:24.181 --> 01:43:24.181
<v Speaker 2>have an agreement that we're America and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not conscious.</v>

2490
01:43:24.290 --> 01:43:26.180
<v Speaker 2>We all get together and we fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>strive.</v>

2491
01:43:26.220 --> 01:43:28.560
<v Speaker 2>We try to make the best shit and be </v>
<v Speaker 2>proud of that,</v>

2492
01:43:28.561 --> 01:43:33.561
<v Speaker 2>but to make it seem like you're great </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're American when you were </v>

2493
01:43:33.561 --> 01:43:35.640
<v Speaker 2>just fucking born in a lucky spot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's ridiculous.</v>

2494
01:43:35.740 --> 01:43:37.960
<v Speaker 6>That's fucking bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not your country.</v>

2495
01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:38.750
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>exactly.</v>

2496
01:43:39.080 --> 01:43:41.490
<v Speaker 6>You if you're lucky enough to be born </v>
<v Speaker 6>anywhere you're at,</v>

2497
01:43:41.500 --> 01:43:43.300
<v Speaker 6>you should be proud of of where you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>at,</v>

2498
01:43:43.301 --> 01:43:48.301
<v Speaker 6>but part of being,</v>
<v Speaker 6>having pride in that is by being a </v>

2499
01:43:48.301 --> 01:43:51.781
<v Speaker 6>fucking good example of a human being </v>
<v Speaker 6>and representing that culture to its </v>

2500
01:43:51.781 --> 01:43:51.781
<v Speaker 6>fullest.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's it.</v>

2501
01:43:51.781 --> 01:43:52.290
<v Speaker 6>Not being proud</v>

2502
01:43:52.290 --> 01:43:54.090
<v Speaker 2>that you're from a fucking city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stupid.</v>

2503
01:43:54.230 --> 01:43:55.380
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's ridiculous.</v>

2504
01:43:55.381 --> 01:44:00.381
<v Speaker 2>Be Proud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be Proud of your own personal control </v>

2505
01:44:00.381 --> 01:44:00.381
<v Speaker 2>over your character</v>

2506
01:44:00.381 --> 01:44:02.050
<v Speaker 6>and your contribution to hew to your </v>
<v Speaker 6>community.</v>

2507
01:44:02.060 --> 01:44:05.930
<v Speaker 6>Your community is to be a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>involve yourself.</v>

2508
01:44:06.920 --> 01:44:11.920
<v Speaker 2>That's the big problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know I've said this over and over </v>

2509
01:44:11.920 --> 01:44:15.791
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that the biggest resource in the </v>

2510
01:44:15.791 --> 01:44:15.791
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his children,</v>

2511
01:44:15.791 --> 01:44:15.800
<v Speaker 2>children will become the adults of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>future obviously,</v>

2512
01:44:16.040 --> 01:44:21.040
<v Speaker 2>and the more access to information and </v>
<v Speaker 2>character building exercises and the </v>

2513
01:44:21.711 --> 01:44:26.711
<v Speaker 2>more we can make them great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the better off the future's going to be </v>

2514
01:44:26.711 --> 01:44:29.531
<v Speaker 2>for everybody of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's the most neglected aspect of </v>

2515
01:44:29.531 --> 01:44:29.531
<v Speaker 2>this world.</v>

2516
01:44:29.531 --> 01:44:29.790
<v Speaker 6>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2517
01:44:30.150 --> 01:44:32.730
<v Speaker 6>how many people are just out there </v>
<v Speaker 6>popping kids out?</v>

2518
01:44:32.790 --> 01:44:35.100
<v Speaker 6>They don't have the education or the </v>
<v Speaker 6>money to support.</v>

2519
01:44:35.130 --> 01:44:36.120
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they don't even,</v>

2520
01:44:36.300 --> 01:44:41.300
<v Speaker 6>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I look at it is they don't understand </v>

2521
01:44:41.300 --> 01:44:42.560
<v Speaker 6>how difficult and how important raising </v>
<v Speaker 6>a child.</v>

2522
01:44:43.050 --> 01:44:45.210
<v Speaker 2>There's also a disconnect in what we </v>
<v Speaker 2>call culture.</v>

2523
01:44:45.930 --> 01:44:50.930
<v Speaker 2>There's a disconnect in a society </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the society started out where </v>

2524
01:44:50.930 --> 01:44:54.621
<v Speaker 2>everybody had to stick together because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you go on a hunting parties and you </v>

2525
01:44:54.621 --> 01:44:57.551
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd be growing food or taking care of </v>

2526
01:44:57.551 --> 01:44:59.020
<v Speaker 2>babies and they were to be collective </v>
<v Speaker 2>collection collectives where,</v>

2527
01:44:59.021 --> 01:44:59.290
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2528
01:44:59.400 --> 01:45:01.950
<v Speaker 2>everybody would pile in their food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody had to stay alive.</v>

2529
01:45:01.960 --> 01:45:06.960
<v Speaker 2>Everybody had to do their own job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody knew everybody encountered on </v>

2530
01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:06.960
<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it got to a point where there wasn't</v>

2531
01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:07.740
<v Speaker 2>50 people anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

2532
01:45:07.840 --> 01:45:09.790
<v Speaker 2>now you have walls and now there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousand,</v>

2533
01:45:09.791 --> 01:45:14.791
<v Speaker 2>now there's 2000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you don't even know these fucking </v>

2534
01:45:14.791 --> 01:45:14.791
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>

2535
01:45:14.791 --> 01:45:17.720
<v Speaker 2>that this disconnect is in place where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have all these people that are </v>

2536
01:45:17.720 --> 01:45:19.320
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be like your comrades and </v>
<v Speaker 2>your brothers and sisters,</v>

2537
01:45:19.321 --> 01:45:21.540
<v Speaker 2>but you don't even fucking know them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

2538
01:45:21.541 --> 01:45:23.460
<v Speaker 2>And then it get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's when you get to a city and that's</v>

2539
01:45:23.461 --> 01:45:25.500
<v Speaker 2>when you get to a country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's where America is.</v>

2540
01:45:25.520 --> 01:45:26.240
<v Speaker 2>It's this weird</v>

2541
01:45:26.260 --> 01:45:31.260
<v Speaker 6>then now look at the way that technology</v>
<v Speaker 6>has influenced our disconnect from each </v>

2542
01:45:31.260 --> 01:45:34.621
<v Speaker 6>other.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're buried in your phone everyday of </v>

2543
01:45:34.621 --> 01:45:34.621
<v Speaker 6>every,</v>
<v Speaker 6>of every second of every hour.</v>

2544
01:45:34.621 --> 01:45:38.570
<v Speaker 6>These people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're not talking to anybody in line </v>

2545
01:45:38.570 --> 01:45:40.451
<v Speaker 6>and you're not actually conversing with </v>
<v Speaker 6>the people that provide the services </v>

2546
01:45:40.451 --> 01:45:41.050
<v Speaker 6>that you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that you're supposed to go to in life.</v>

2547
01:45:41.420 --> 01:45:42.520
<v Speaker 6>Like the postman,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

2548
01:45:42.730 --> 01:45:45.190
<v Speaker 6>the person with the supermarket.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're not converting.</v>

2549
01:45:45.191 --> 01:45:45.790
<v Speaker 6>You're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>

2550
01:45:46.090 --> 01:45:47.530
<v Speaker 6>swipe card.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do whatever you got back.</v>

2551
01:45:47.550 --> 01:45:47.790
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2552
01:45:47.890 --> 01:45:50.770
<v Speaker 2>ironically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also connecting countries,</v>

2553
01:45:50.890 --> 01:45:53.800
<v Speaker 2>Internet connects countries and </v>
<v Speaker 2>disconnects people.</v>

2554
01:45:53.850 --> 01:45:56.430
<v Speaker 6>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The thing is is that the internet can be</v>

2555
01:45:56.431 --> 01:46:01.431
<v Speaker 6>used for so much good and it can also be</v>
<v Speaker 6>a crutch to turn you into a shitty </v>

2556
01:46:01.431 --> 01:46:05.600
<v Speaker 6>completely non community based.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You think that you're getting the same </v>

2557
01:46:05.600 --> 01:46:07.260
<v Speaker 6>thing by being on facebook or twitter </v>
<v Speaker 6>and all this and that.</v>

2558
01:46:07.340 --> 01:46:09.170
<v Speaker 6>All of sudden that you're interacting </v>
<v Speaker 6>with people,</v>

2559
01:46:09.450 --> 01:46:12.630
<v Speaker 6>you are interacting with people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that is not the way humanity works.</v>

2560
01:46:12.631 --> 01:46:17.631
<v Speaker 6>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was reading a thing about how being a </v>

2561
01:46:17.631 --> 01:46:19.941
<v Speaker 6>misanthrope like deliberately not </v>
<v Speaker 6>interacting with society on a regular </v>

2562
01:46:20.071 --> 01:46:22.980
<v Speaker 6>basis can be worse than being an </v>
<v Speaker 6>alcoholic for your,</v>

2563
01:46:23.010 --> 01:46:28.010
<v Speaker 6>for your body and your health.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like just simply not interacting with </v>

2564
01:46:28.010 --> 01:46:28.470
<v Speaker 6>other people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2565
01:46:28.550 --> 01:46:29.790
<v Speaker 6>it makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's just,</v>

2566
01:46:29.791 --> 01:46:30.890
<v Speaker 6>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're dwelling on it</v>

2567
01:46:30.960 --> 01:46:34.530
<v Speaker 2>negative energy and you're not getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>any positive warm from humans,</v>

2568
01:46:34.531 --> 01:46:37.520
<v Speaker 2>which is like one of the most satisfying</v>
<v Speaker 2>things a person can get as well.</v>

2569
01:46:37.521 --> 01:46:37.640
<v Speaker 2>Like</v>

2570
01:46:37.780 --> 01:46:38.880
<v Speaker 6>love from other people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2571
01:46:38.881 --> 01:46:41.010
<v Speaker 6>You see somebody write something nice to</v>
<v Speaker 6>you online,</v>

2572
01:46:41.011 --> 01:46:41.940
<v Speaker 6>all that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's cool.</v>

2573
01:46:42.030 --> 01:46:43.960
<v Speaker 6>If you have an a one on one </v>
<v Speaker 6>conversation,</v>

2574
01:46:43.980 --> 01:46:45.480
<v Speaker 6>look somebody in the eye and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know what,</v>

2575
01:46:45.481 --> 01:46:49.550
<v Speaker 6>I really respect you for the person that</v>
<v Speaker 6>you and I,</v>

<v Speaker 6>Same as like people want to send text </v>

<v Speaker 6>And you stay right there.</v>

2605
01:47:49.580 --> 01:47:52.340
<v Speaker 6>My own boat and a bonanza.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This vagina right out.</v>

2606
01:47:52.570 --> 01:47:53.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2607
01:47:53.291 --> 01:47:54.430
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2608
01:47:54.490 --> 01:47:56.730
<v Speaker 2>the lack of development of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2609
01:47:56.740 --> 01:48:01.740
<v Speaker 2>of human beings like where they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>tested and where they have to develop </v>

2610
01:48:01.740 --> 01:48:05.491
<v Speaker 2>character that's like one of the big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like one of the most disappointing </v>

2611
01:48:07.211 --> 01:48:10.990
<v Speaker 2>aspects of our society and our culture </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that we've never figured out a way to</v>

2612
01:48:10.991 --> 01:48:15.670
<v Speaker 2>cultivate people correctly that way we </v>
<v Speaker 2>can do it.</v>

2613
01:48:15.710 --> 01:48:20.710
<v Speaker 2>That's the question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have plenty of money and plenty of </v>

2614
01:48:20.710 --> 01:48:20.710
<v Speaker 2>resources to do things.</v>

2615
01:48:20.710 --> 01:48:24.220
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and it can just start from the smallest </v>

2616
01:48:24.220 --> 01:48:24.220
<v Speaker 6>thing in the house with chores to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to just,</v>

2617
01:48:24.220 --> 01:48:25.350
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just being stern in your word and,</v>

2618
01:48:25.420 --> 01:48:30.420
<v Speaker 6>and leading by example.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean the opportunity to give children </v>

2619
01:48:30.420 --> 01:48:33.410
<v Speaker 6>those things to help develop them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>male or female,</v>

2620
01:48:33.500 --> 01:48:38.500
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>exist every single day and they're </v>

2621
01:48:38.500 --> 01:48:40.990
<v Speaker 6>completely at our fingertips.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If we want to choose to participate and </v>

2622
01:48:40.990 --> 01:48:44.051
<v Speaker 6>taking that kind of responsibility for </v>
<v Speaker 6>bringing this child into the world and </v>

2623
01:48:44.051 --> 01:48:45.260
<v Speaker 6>trying to raise them to be a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2624
01:48:45.280 --> 01:48:46.760
<v Speaker 6>an awesome human being,</v>
<v Speaker 6>an uh,</v>

2625
01:48:46.940 --> 01:48:51.940
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>contributing important part of society </v>

2626
01:48:51.940 --> 01:48:54.470
<v Speaker 6>and helping show by example what a good </v>
<v Speaker 6>person is.</v>

2627
01:48:54.471 --> 01:48:56.370
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the drop that starts the ripples.</v>

2628
01:48:56.371 --> 01:48:57.260
<v Speaker 6>That's super important.</v>

2629
01:48:57.480 --> 01:49:02.480
<v Speaker 2>Well it is and some people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they obviously they take on that task </v>

2630
01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:02.480
<v Speaker 2>when they're just trying to get some </v>
<v Speaker 2>pussy,</v>

2631
01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:03.240
<v Speaker 2>let people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden they're there,</v>

2632
01:49:03.241 --> 01:49:08.241
<v Speaker 2>they're there in this situation and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>try to make due and they fuck up and </v>

2633
01:49:08.241 --> 01:49:08.241
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2634
01:49:08.241 --> 01:49:08.790
<v Speaker 2>they really don't have their own shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

2635
01:49:09.060 --> 01:49:14.060
<v Speaker 2>But I think as a society what we got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a real problem in that we,</v>

2636
01:49:14.470 --> 01:49:18.810
<v Speaker 2>we haven't really addressed how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>properly,</v>

2637
01:49:19.270 --> 01:49:22.170
<v Speaker 2>properly make use of our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our young people.</v>

2638
01:49:22.350 --> 01:49:27.350
<v Speaker 2>I think it's beautiful to have freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's beautiful to have the ability to </v>

2639
01:49:27.350 --> 01:49:27.590
<v Speaker 2>choose whatever occupation you want and </v>
<v Speaker 2>speed.</v>

2640
01:49:27.870 --> 01:49:32.400
<v Speaker 2>But I think that like the steps that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>go from being a young man,</v>

2641
01:49:32.401 --> 01:49:34.140
<v Speaker 2>living with your parents to being in </v>
<v Speaker 2>college,</v>

2642
01:49:34.141 --> 01:49:37.530
<v Speaker 2>to being independent there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're so obscure and massive.</v>

2643
01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:39.310
<v Speaker 2>It's so like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>am I really am out of.</v>

2644
01:49:39.330 --> 01:49:40.470
<v Speaker 2>Am I out here now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

2645
01:49:40.471 --> 01:49:42.570
<v Speaker 2>now I've got to get an apartment and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what do I do now?</v>

2646
01:49:42.571 --> 01:49:44.230
<v Speaker 2>While you've got to make sure you got a </v>
<v Speaker 2>good job,</v>

2647
01:49:44.250 --> 01:49:44.990
<v Speaker 2>but a good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

2648
01:49:44.991 --> 01:49:46.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could do that.</v>

2649
01:49:46.051 --> 01:49:46.730
<v Speaker 2>How do you get the good?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2650
01:49:46.740 --> 01:49:47.490
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go to college,</v>

2651
01:49:47.491 --> 01:49:48.030
<v Speaker 2>you go to college,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you</v>

2652
01:49:48.030 --> 01:49:49.440
<v Speaker 4>spend on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like actually,</v>

2653
01:49:49.800 --> 01:49:52.050
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's still this huge myth that</v>

2654
01:49:52.051 --> 01:49:54.480
<v Speaker 4>you need to go get a four year degree in</v>
<v Speaker 4>dollar ship will,</v>

2655
01:49:54.500 --> 01:49:59.500
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not every four year degree is actually </v>

2656
01:49:59.500 --> 01:50:00.210
<v Speaker 4>worth the fucking $50,000.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just put yourself in debt.</v>

2657
01:50:00.211 --> 01:50:05.211
<v Speaker 4>Like sometimes you're actually doing a </v>
<v Speaker 4>disservice to yourself and putting </v>

2658
01:50:05.211 --> 01:50:07.761
<v Speaker 4>yourself behind the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can be just another college </v>

2659
01:50:07.761 --> 01:50:08.270
<v Speaker 4>graduate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>work in a fucking shit job that can't,</v>

2660
01:50:08.330 --> 01:50:11.050
<v Speaker 4>can barely pay off their loans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got to realize what,</v>

2661
01:50:11.100 --> 01:50:16.100
<v Speaker 4>what is it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where is it worth putting that money </v>

2662
01:50:16.100 --> 01:50:16.100
<v Speaker 4>towards?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I tell people all the time</v>

2663
01:50:16.100 --> 01:50:17.040
<v Speaker 4>that are just sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2664
01:50:17.041 --> 01:50:18.170
<v Speaker 4>unsettled,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

2665
01:50:18.180 --> 01:50:18.720
<v Speaker 4>Even,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2666
01:50:18.730 --> 01:50:19.900
<v Speaker 4>parents are kids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2667
01:50:19.940 --> 01:50:22.530
<v Speaker 4>we're thinking about moving them along </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the next step.</v>

2668
01:50:22.531 --> 01:50:24.870
<v Speaker 4>They're graduating to go sending a fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2669
01:50:24.871 --> 01:50:25.620
<v Speaker 4>figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get a,</v>

2670
01:50:25.740 --> 01:50:26.820
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he probably isn't.</v>

2671
01:50:26.850 --> 01:50:28.710
<v Speaker 4>He or she isn't going to really know </v>
<v Speaker 4>what they want to do yet.</v>

2672
01:50:29.190 --> 01:50:30.840
<v Speaker 4>Likely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if they have an idea,</v>

2673
01:50:31.080 --> 01:50:32.430
<v Speaker 4>find the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>find the,</v>

2674
01:50:32.431 --> 01:50:37.431
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the university or whatever school that </v>

2675
01:50:37.431 --> 01:50:39.171
<v Speaker 4>at some point they're going to need to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be at and then find the appropriate </v>

2676
01:50:39.171 --> 01:50:42.681
<v Speaker 4>junior community college that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that transfer as well into that fucking </v>

2677
01:50:42.681 --> 01:50:45.300
<v Speaker 4>dude and the dude that because you need </v>
<v Speaker 4>to get in there and get your shit done.</v>

2678
01:50:46.020 --> 01:50:47.580
<v Speaker 4>Books,</v>
<v Speaker 4>education.</v>

2679
01:50:47.670 --> 01:50:49.950
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you really want to be true about it,</v>

2680
01:50:49.951 --> 01:50:51.870
<v Speaker 4>you don't have to go to college to learn</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>

2681
01:50:52.350 --> 01:50:57.350
<v Speaker 4>You can fucking read a book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can teach yourself and even with </v>

2682
01:50:57.350 --> 01:50:57.350
<v Speaker 4>like the Internet like you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>

2683
01:50:57.350 --> 01:51:01.910
<v Speaker 4>there is so much information and </v>
<v Speaker 4>knowledge out there that a person can </v>

2684
01:51:01.910 --> 01:51:01.910
<v Speaker 4>process.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now of course,</v>

2685
01:51:01.910 --> 01:51:06.710
<v Speaker 4>having one on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well you don't ever get that </v>

2686
01:51:06.710 --> 01:51:08.811
<v Speaker 4>necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but having human interaction to help </v>

2687
01:51:08.811 --> 01:51:10.860
<v Speaker 4>guide you upon this with their own </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience is invaluable.</v>

2688
01:51:11.130 --> 01:51:16.130
<v Speaker 4>But the actual knowledge of the APP,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the actual process of just gathering </v>

2689
01:51:16.261 --> 01:51:18.570
<v Speaker 4>knowledge and getting understandings </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2690
01:51:18.690 --> 01:51:23.690
<v Speaker 4>fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you think you could become a lawyer by </v>

2691
01:51:23.690 --> 01:51:23.690
<v Speaker 4>going to a library.</v>

2692
01:51:23.690 --> 01:51:25.710
<v Speaker 2>The actual process of gathering </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge for sure is,</v>

2693
01:51:25.711 --> 01:51:26.460
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2694
01:51:26.461 --> 01:51:29.100
<v Speaker 2>it's much easier now than it's ever been</v>
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

2695
01:51:29.220 --> 01:51:34.220
<v Speaker 2>The real problem is that people don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>have good guidelines as far as behavior,</v>

2696
01:51:36.061 --> 01:51:38.700
<v Speaker 2>as far as getting things done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and as far as positive thinking,</v>

2697
01:51:38.730 --> 01:51:43.730
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that has been a side </v>

2698
01:51:43.730 --> 01:51:46.881
<v Speaker 2>effect of this podcast are completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>unintended and we never saw it coming.</v>

2699
01:51:48.150 --> 01:51:51.540
<v Speaker 2>Was that all these fucking people are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I meet them after shows.</v>

2700
01:51:51.690 --> 01:51:53.550
<v Speaker 2>He changed my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lost 100 pounds.</v>

2701
01:51:53.551 --> 01:51:55.770
<v Speaker 2>I drink Kale shakes every morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I work out everyday.</v>

2702
01:51:55.830 --> 01:51:59.850
<v Speaker 2>I started Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like thousands of fucking people.</v>

2703
01:51:59.880 --> 01:52:04.880
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what they say is that almost to a </v>

2704
01:52:04.880 --> 01:52:09.681
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like I never had anybody around me </v>

2705
01:52:09.681 --> 01:52:09.681
<v Speaker 2>that was talking the right way is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't me.</v>

2706
01:52:09.681 --> 01:52:12.010
<v Speaker 2>It's not that I didn't have potential.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that I have no,</v>

2707
01:52:12.011 --> 01:52:16.140
<v Speaker 2>but nobody that motivated me and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden someone did and now what</v>

2708
01:52:16.141 --> 01:52:17.220
<v Speaker 2>are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you sleeping over there?</v>

2709
01:52:17.221 --> 01:52:18.060
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not me.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That wasn't you.</v>

2713
01:52:24.480 --> 01:52:25.740
<v Speaker 4>I think there's not enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't.</v>

2714
01:52:25.741 --> 01:52:29.340
<v Speaker 4>You know somebody who is breathing and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't like</v>

<v Speaker 2>it wasn't him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

2717
01:52:33.170 --> 01:52:38.170
<v Speaker 4>I swear to God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That sounds really familiar to a lot of </v>

2718
01:52:39.351 --> 01:52:40.040
<v Speaker 4>women.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've called.</v>

<v Speaker 6>world?</v>

2731
01:53:06.681 --> 01:53:08.540
<v Speaker 6>Start with yourself and it goes from </v>
<v Speaker 6>there.</v>

2732
01:53:08.690 --> 01:53:09.760
<v Speaker 2>We'll start with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So lead.</v>

2733
01:53:09.930 --> 01:53:12.110
<v Speaker 2>Give an example that other people can </v>
<v Speaker 2>follow.</v>

2734
01:53:12.111 --> 01:53:13.580
<v Speaker 2>Just like the examples that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>followed.</v>

2735
01:53:13.581 --> 01:53:18.581
<v Speaker 2>I mean everybody is where they are </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they learn for someone greater </v>

2736
01:53:18.581 --> 01:53:18.581
<v Speaker 2>than them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Almost everybody to a person.</v>

2737
01:53:18.581 --> 01:53:19.400
<v Speaker 2>Learn from somebody.</v>

2738
01:53:19.660 --> 01:53:24.470
<v Speaker 6>When I have some of the men that have </v>
<v Speaker 6>been formative in developing who I am as</v>

2739
01:53:24.471 --> 01:53:29.471
<v Speaker 6>a man in life,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I tell people some of the stories </v>

2740
01:53:29.471 --> 01:53:30.150
<v Speaker 6>that came to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2741
01:53:30.400 --> 01:53:35.400
<v Speaker 6>to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to have these people in my life and </v>

2742
01:53:35.400 --> 01:53:35.400
<v Speaker 6>some,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and there's some folks,</v>

2743
01:53:35.400 --> 01:53:35.400
<v Speaker 6>especially a lot of these,</v>
<v Speaker 6>these,</v>

2744
01:53:35.400 --> 01:53:40.241
<v Speaker 6>these men nowadays that are,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I'm not even to speak about women </v>

2745
01:53:40.241 --> 01:53:43.511
<v Speaker 6>because women and men are,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they have totally different mindsets in </v>

2746
01:53:43.511 --> 01:53:43.511
<v Speaker 6>the way that they develop.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>

2747

2787
01:55:23.540 --> 01:55:26.310
<v Speaker 6>substance that you could use a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was probably someplace that was quite</v>

2791
01:55:33.180 --> 01:55:38.180
<v Speaker 6>in England.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They used to wrestle on a carpet </v>

2792
01:55:38.180 --> 01:55:38.180
<v Speaker 6>throwing each other.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Jesus,</v>

2793
01:55:39.840 --> 01:55:41.700
<v Speaker 6>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But that was it.</v>

2794
01:55:41.810 --> 01:55:45.470
<v Speaker 2>Pick out a famous catch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>

2795
01:55:45.500 --> 01:55:48.770
<v Speaker 2>there's a couple different schools of </v>
<v Speaker 2>submission style,</v>

2796
01:55:48.771 --> 01:55:52.680
<v Speaker 2>a grappling and one of the earliest ones</v>
<v Speaker 2>in America,</v>

2797
01:55:52.681 --> 01:55:55.160
<v Speaker 2>the called catch wrestling or catch as </v>
<v Speaker 2>catch can.</v>

2798
01:55:55.490 --> 01:55:56.730
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

2799
01:55:56.760 --> 01:55:59.020
<v Speaker 2>it was real professional wrestling at </v>
<v Speaker 2>one point in time,</v>

2800
01:55:59.570 --> 01:56:01.460
<v Speaker 2>unlike theatrical professional </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrestling,</v>

2801
01:56:01.461 --> 01:56:03.530
<v Speaker 2>which is like entertainment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They used to,</v>

2802
01:56:03.560 --> 01:56:06.740
<v Speaker 2>they used to go out and then you can pin</v>
<v Speaker 2>a guy or you can submit them.</v>

2803
01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:08.330
<v Speaker 2>It could be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could be either one.</v>

2804
01:56:08.550 --> 01:56:13.550
<v Speaker 2>And there's a lot of gangster fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>holds that I learned from Sylvia Momenta</v>

2805
01:56:14.290 --> 01:56:16.630
<v Speaker 2>who was a black belt in a gene labell oh</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2806
01:56:16.720 --> 01:56:19.200
<v Speaker 2>Gina Bell loves all that Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So sylvio,</v>

2807
01:56:19.201 --> 01:56:24.201
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was always like pig and all these </v>

2808
01:56:24.201 --> 01:56:24.290
<v Speaker 2>crazy net cranks and all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these different things that like,</v>

2809
01:56:24.530 --> 01:56:25.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why aren't these in Jujitsu?</v>

2810
01:56:25.960 --> 01:56:27.170
<v Speaker 2>Cause.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they are.</v>

2811
01:56:27.290 --> 01:56:29.210
<v Speaker 2>Some guys use them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you see,</v>

2812
01:56:29.211 --> 01:56:31.400
<v Speaker 2>did you see Damien Maia has victory over</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rick Story?</v>

2813
01:56:31.650 --> 01:56:32.820
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no I didn't.</v>

2814
01:56:32.910 --> 01:56:35.250
<v Speaker 2>He submitted them in the first round,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he got his back.</v>

2815
01:56:35.251 --> 01:56:37.640
<v Speaker 2>He couldn't get a rear naked and so he </v>
<v Speaker 2>turned it into a net cranking.</v>

2816
01:56:37.770 --> 01:56:38.030
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

2817
01:56:38.440 --> 01:56:39.710
<v Speaker 6>Fuck the shit out of luck.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2818
01:56:39.830 --> 01:56:41.340
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was a terrible angle.</v>

2819
01:56:41.350 --> 01:56:45.590
<v Speaker 6>Like it was like instant tap ones.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like your head's gonna fly off.</v>

2820
01:56:45.620 --> 01:56:48.280
<v Speaker 6>Sure enough,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean wrestling is wrestling match and,</v>

2821
01:56:48.310 --> 01:56:52.100
<v Speaker 6>and it's all over the world and people </v>
<v Speaker 6>are styles that have developed,</v>

2822
01:56:52.101 --> 01:56:57.101
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Jujitsu is the way it is for the most </v>

2823
01:56:57.101 --> 01:56:57.101
<v Speaker 6>part because of the rules of the sport,</v>
<v Speaker 6>of Jujitsu.</v>

2824
01:56:57.101 --> 01:57:00.881
<v Speaker 6>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>often sport will predicate how your </v>

2825
01:57:00.881 --> 01:57:04.721
<v Speaker 6>training will be developed because you </v>
<v Speaker 6>want to be the best within this </v>

2826
01:57:04.721 --> 01:57:04.721
<v Speaker 6>confinement.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

2827
01:57:04.721 --> 01:57:09.100
<v Speaker 6>but that doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's not to say that you can't expand </v>

2828
01:57:09.100 --> 01:57:09.100
<v Speaker 6>upon anything with the human body.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you want to be a dynamic,</v>

2829
01:57:09.100 --> 01:57:10.340
<v Speaker 6>be as dynamic as you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2830
01:57:10.660 --> 01:57:13.880
<v Speaker 6>the jkd Bruce Lee's philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>eat the meat and spit out the bone.</v>

2831
01:57:13.881 --> 01:57:18.881
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's no reason anybody can't do that </v>

2832
01:57:18.881 --> 01:57:18.881
<v Speaker 6>for themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But you know,</v>

<v Speaker 6>Jake Shannon,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Shannon.</v>

2836
01:57:22.820 --> 01:57:27.820
<v Speaker 6>Shannon is a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a great historian when it comes to just </v>

2837
01:57:27.820 --> 01:57:28.040
<v Speaker 6>the traps.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Awesome dude all around me when it comes</v>

2838
01:57:28.041 --> 01:57:28.640
<v Speaker 6>to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2839
01:57:28.680 --> 01:57:33.680
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>even political stuff and cultural stuff </v>

2840
01:57:33.680 --> 01:57:35.801
<v Speaker 6>and he's a brilliant dude and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the shit that he puts out there in the </v>

2841
01:57:35.801 --> 01:57:39.401
<v Speaker 6>world as a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not just the catch stuff is amazing </v>

2842
01:57:39.401 --> 01:57:39.401
<v Speaker 6>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2843
01:57:39.401 --> 01:57:39.401
<v Speaker 6>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's a really good dude.</v>

2844
01:57:39.401 --> 01:57:40.110
<v Speaker 6>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Historically</v>

2845
01:57:40.200 --> 01:57:45.200
<v Speaker 2>he really loves like the history of </v>
<v Speaker 2>catch wrestling and because of him and </v>

2846
01:57:45.200 --> 01:57:47.640
<v Speaker 2>he's put out books and dvds and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but some of the photos that he's found,</v>

2847
01:57:47.940 --> 01:57:51.300
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing like the techniques that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they had that they were using,</v>

2848
01:57:51.301 --> 01:57:55.020
<v Speaker 2>like triangles that were using,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were using half guard.</v>

2849
01:57:55.050 --> 01:57:56.970
<v Speaker 2>They're using the lockdown from half </v>
<v Speaker 2>guard.</v>

2850
01:57:57.180 --> 01:57:59.100
<v Speaker 2>There were sweeping guys with these </v>
<v Speaker 2>positions.</v>

2851
01:57:59.101 --> 01:58:01.580
<v Speaker 2>Are we using all these different good </v>
<v Speaker 2>teams arm in game.</v>

2852
01:58:01.870 --> 01:58:02.260
<v Speaker 2>The first</v>

2853
01:58:02.260 --> 01:58:07.260
<v Speaker 6>time I saw the lockdown Sushi Osaka was </v>
<v Speaker 6>doing it to us in an AMC back in the day</v>

2854
01:58:08.501 --> 01:58:10.390
<v Speaker 6>and he used it as the submission </v>
<v Speaker 6>version.</v>

2855
01:58:10.570 --> 01:58:15.570
<v Speaker 6>So you get lined up on a half guard,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you'd throw the lockdown on and you </v>

2856
01:58:15.570 --> 01:58:17.410
<v Speaker 6>would extend and you basically you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>putting like a calf crank on somebody.</v>

2857
01:58:17.411 --> 01:58:22.411
<v Speaker 6>And so that's how I first,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this was back in like 2001 if you count </v>

2858
01:58:23.330 --> 01:58:25.480
<v Speaker 6>sideways on it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like a heel hook too.</v>

2859
01:58:25.800 --> 01:58:30.800
<v Speaker 6>So that's how I learned it as like a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a tricky little submission and </v>

2860
01:58:30.800 --> 01:58:30.800
<v Speaker 6>close Daca was full of them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2861
01:58:30.800 --> 01:58:31.900
<v Speaker 6>tk.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2862
01:58:31.950 --> 01:58:34.620
<v Speaker 6>And so that's what I first found out </v>
<v Speaker 6>about lockdown.</v>

2863
01:58:34.690 --> 01:58:36.070
<v Speaker 6>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2864
01:58:36.750 --> 01:58:38.380
<v Speaker 6>and then I saw Eddie,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2865
01:58:38.500 --> 01:58:42.920
<v Speaker 6>he came across and he used it as a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>as a positional to keep him for,</v>

2866
01:58:42.960 --> 01:58:47.770
<v Speaker 6>for using his bottom game in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 6>his reverses reversals and setting up,</v>

2867
01:58:47.800 --> 01:58:52.800
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>isolating that leg to use it later into </v>

2868
01:58:52.800 --> 01:58:52.800
<v Speaker 6>different applications.</v>

2869
01:58:52.800 --> 01:58:55.860
<v Speaker 6>But it just goes to show you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can do fucking things a million </v>

2870
01:58:55.860 --> 01:58:56.380
<v Speaker 6>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then I remember Billy Robinson,</v>

2891
01:59:35.920 --> 01:59:38.290

2933
02:01:07.231 --> 02:01:07.480

<v Speaker 6>the attitude is kind of different.</v>

2934
02:01:09.280 --> 02:01:10.320
<v Speaker 6>Still.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Plenty of Brits,</v>

<v Speaker 6>Garcia and that's like his number one </v>

2949
02:01:40.101 --> 02:01:41.000

<v Speaker 6>Even though you've never trained </v>

2951
02:01:46.280 --> 02:01:46.370
<v Speaker 6>Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you've never seen Marcello and trust me,</v>

2952
02:01:46.580 --> 02:01:49.460
<v Speaker 6>billy Robinson had never seen or heard </v>
<v Speaker 6>of Marcello Garcia.</v>

2953
02:01:50.620 --> 02:01:51.970
<v Speaker 2>It's just moves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2954
02:01:51.971 --> 02:01:54.850
<v Speaker 2>Well Marcello's technique is fairly </v>
<v Speaker 2>basic.</v>

2955
02:01:54.851 --> 02:01:58.390
<v Speaker 2>It's just that he had hit it so well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the arm drag to the back.</v>

2956
02:01:58.420 --> 02:02:00.670
<v Speaker 2>It was pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty standard the way he did it with.</v>

2957
02:02:00.671 --> 02:02:02.370
<v Speaker 2>So is this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is this powering.</v>

2958
02:02:02.860 --> 02:02:04.580
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very good photos.</v>

2959
02:02:04.610 --> 02:02:07.630
<v Speaker 2>Is this real?</v>
<v Speaker 2>These motherfuckers still do this shit.</v>

2960
02:02:09.180 --> 02:02:11.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't see any spikes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did they give up on the spikes?</v>

2961
02:02:11.740 --> 02:02:13.450
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have spikes around their ankles.</v>

2962
02:02:14.690 --> 02:02:16.240
<v Speaker 6>Do you see?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm talking about she's.</v>

2963
02:02:16.630 --> 02:02:19.720
<v Speaker 6>When there's not enough vagina around,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you start doing really stupid shit.</v>

2964
02:02:19.740 --> 02:02:20.320
<v Speaker 6>It.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Trust me.</v>

2965
02:02:20.321 --> 02:02:23.260
<v Speaker 6>I grew up in Boston.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know what's up.</v>

2966
02:02:23.620 --> 02:02:24.340
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2967
02:02:24.370 --> 02:02:25.630
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there we go.</v>

2968
02:02:26.060 --> 02:02:26.580
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2969
02:02:26.600 --> 02:02:29.050
<v Speaker 2>this guy grew up doing that as well when</v>
<v Speaker 2>they weren't.</v>

2970
02:02:29.320 --> 02:02:31.570
<v Speaker 6>I don't think Billy Robinson was doing </v>
<v Speaker 6>any permanent.</v>

2971
02:02:31.571 --> 02:02:35.050
<v Speaker 6>I think it was smarter than that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's just the fact that,</v>

2972
02:02:35.110 --> 02:02:36.530
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>moves are moves and you know,</v>

2973
02:02:36.570 --> 02:02:39.790
<v Speaker 6>he's showing something from one angle </v>
<v Speaker 6>and it's like,</v>

2974
02:02:39.820 --> 02:02:40.750
<v Speaker 6>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2975
02:02:40.751 --> 02:02:42.790
<v Speaker 6>there's a guy doing that right now and </v>
<v Speaker 6>he's winning a world title.</v>

2976
02:02:42.870 --> 02:02:46.250
<v Speaker 2>I think it was really interesting when </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Shin Kicking Championships,</v>

2977
02:02:46.370 --> 02:02:47.820
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is state,</v>

2978
02:02:47.920 --> 02:02:50.200

<v Speaker 2>They're putting hay.</v>

2979
02:02:50.280 --> 02:02:52.050
<v Speaker 2>They're packing their shins with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2980
02:02:52.230 --> 02:02:54.060
<v Speaker 2>this is fake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fake.</v>

2981
02:02:54.061 --> 02:02:57.390
<v Speaker 2>These frauds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>frauds take these frauds away.</v>

2982
02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:03.000
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was really interesting in mma when </v>

2983
02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.420
<v Speaker 2>soccer Robert came along because there </v>
<v Speaker 2>was this one style of submissions that </v>

2984
02:03:05.420 --> 02:03:09.621
<v Speaker 2>everybody was sort of gravitating </v>
<v Speaker 2>towards are a lot of people gravitate </v>

2985
02:03:09.621 --> 02:03:09.621
<v Speaker 2>towards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is Brazilian Jujitsu.</v>

2986
02:03:09.621 --> 02:03:12.630
<v Speaker 2>And then there's this Japanese dude who </v>
<v Speaker 2>had this really kind of Funky,</v>

2987
02:03:12.660 --> 02:03:17.660
<v Speaker 2>different sort of style,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did like similar techniques but kinda </v>

2988
02:03:17.660 --> 02:03:21.800
<v Speaker 2>had his own little flair to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it turned out he had actually been </v>

2989
02:03:21.800 --> 02:03:22.860
<v Speaker 2>trained in catch wrestling that he was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>robinson.</v>

2990
02:03:22.920 --> 02:03:25.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an amazing story.</v>

2991
02:03:25.171 --> 02:03:28.620
<v Speaker 2>The Sakharova for people weren't really </v>
<v Speaker 2>fans of MMA.</v>

2992
02:03:28.621 --> 02:03:32.070
<v Speaker 2>They'll never going to appreciate how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what a bad motherfucker Kazoo.</v>

<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>of a,</v>

<v Speaker 6>of like a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just a character got like a sprung </v>

<v Speaker 6>Like just able to,</v>

3002
02:03:51.281 --> 02:03:52.280
<v Speaker 6>to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to bound the,</v>

3003
02:03:52.450 --> 02:03:54.570
<v Speaker 6>to any positioning and come get his </v>
<v Speaker 6>stuff,</v>

3004
02:03:54.571 --> 02:03:55.320
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3005
02:03:55.920 --> 02:04:00.010
<v Speaker 6>back in the day when he was going </v>
<v Speaker 6>through the system and at the UWF during</v>

3006
02:04:00.030 --> 02:04:05.030
<v Speaker 6>the shoot style progressing stuff where </v>
<v Speaker 6>they would sometimes mixing shoots and </v>

3007
02:04:05.030 --> 02:04:07.941
<v Speaker 6>works on the same deal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And a shoot for folks who don't know </v>

3008
02:04:07.941 --> 02:04:10.911
<v Speaker 6>what it means really full on fight,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but these were all predetermined bright </v>

3009
02:04:11.250 --> 02:04:13.350
<v Speaker 6>and these are all under professional </v>
<v Speaker 6>wrestling rules.</v>

3010
02:04:13.351 --> 02:04:18.351
<v Speaker 6>They had this last point thing with the </v>
<v Speaker 6>rope escapes and getting suplex and </v>

3011
02:04:18.351 --> 02:04:18.780
<v Speaker 6>knocked down and whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But uh,</v>

3012
02:04:19.170 --> 02:04:20.040
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>back in the day,</v>

3013
02:04:20.100 --> 02:04:24.630
<v Speaker 6>not only did a Toccata used to beat them</v>
<v Speaker 6>up because Takata used to be a legit,</v>

3014
02:04:24.660 --> 02:04:27.480
<v Speaker 6>like fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I had a hellacious kick.</v>

3015
02:04:27.660 --> 02:04:29.160
<v Speaker 6>He was a good athlete and he could </v>
<v Speaker 6>fight.</v>

3016
02:04:29.580 --> 02:04:34.580
<v Speaker 6>But tamra used to abuse the Shit Outta </v>
<v Speaker 6>Sakharova all the time.</v>

3017
02:04:34.860 --> 02:04:39.860
<v Speaker 6>There was a few times where they'd go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they'd the ring in professional </v>

3018
02:04:39.860 --> 02:04:43.131
<v Speaker 6>wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They would go legit and fucking Tamar </v>

3019
02:04:43.131 --> 02:04:43.131
<v Speaker 6>would own him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like Tamra was the man.</v>

3020
02:04:43.180 --> 02:04:46.100
<v Speaker 3>So what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How did Sakharova he graduated,</v>

3021
02:04:46.101 --> 02:04:46.810
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he grew up.</v>

3022
02:04:46.811 --> 02:04:47.890
<v Speaker 3>He got better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3023
02:04:47.891 --> 02:04:51.520
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And fight the first UFC in Japan when he</v>

3024
02:04:51.521 --> 02:04:53.230
<v Speaker 3>fought Kona.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Vera and they,</v>

3025
02:04:53.231 --> 02:04:58.231
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they stopped prematurely and he was </v>

3026
02:04:58.231 --> 02:04:58.231
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>

3027
02:04:58.231 --> 02:04:58.231
<v Speaker 3>And so they started a back up again </v>
<v Speaker 3>later on,</v>

3028
02:04:58.231 --> 02:04:59.800
<v Speaker 3>later on that night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't fight again.</v>

3029
02:04:59.830 --> 02:05:01.390
<v Speaker 3>It was craziness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

3030
02:05:01.690 --> 02:05:03.230
<v Speaker 3>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just the emotional rollercoaster.</v>

3031
02:05:03.310 --> 02:05:04.900
<v Speaker 3>They must've been under.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't just beat him.</v>

3032
02:05:04.901 --> 02:05:07.050
<v Speaker 3>He went out and tapped him tap conan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Vera,</v>

3033
02:05:07.060 --> 02:05:12.060
<v Speaker 3>which had never been done before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one had seen a Brazilian jujitsu </v>

3034
02:05:12.060 --> 02:05:12.060
<v Speaker 3>black belt get tapped yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like the new thing.</v>

3035
02:05:12.280 --> 02:05:13.990
<v Speaker 3>I was like maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe someone had,</v>

3036
02:05:13.991 --> 02:05:17.690
<v Speaker 3>I think maybe I'm John Lewis and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Andre Pinera,</v>

3037
02:05:17.800 --> 02:05:20.410
<v Speaker 3>I think maybe pet nera said tap John </v>
<v Speaker 3>Lewis.</v>

3038
02:05:20.411 --> 02:05:25.411
<v Speaker 3>Did he tap him?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did he know he didn't tap me soccer.</v>

3039
02:05:25.601 --> 02:05:26.390
<v Speaker 3>Kicked him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3040
02:05:26.420 --> 02:05:31.420
<v Speaker 3>did Sata was on his back and Eris like </v>
<v Speaker 3>slapped why his right leg and came </v>

3041
02:05:31.420 --> 02:05:33.610
<v Speaker 3>around with his left and soccer kicked </v>
<v Speaker 3>them while Sato is an open garden.</v>

3042
02:05:33.640 --> 02:05:38.640
<v Speaker 3>Was so was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who was the first place in Japan to </v>

3043
02:05:38.640 --> 02:05:38.640
<v Speaker 3>black belt to get tapped?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it might've been,</v>

3044
02:05:38.640 --> 02:05:39.390
<v Speaker 3>it might've been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

3045
02:05:39.710 --> 02:05:41.500
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was the most high profile one,</v>

3046
02:05:41.590 --> 02:05:43.090
<v Speaker 3>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well then,</v>

3047
02:05:43.130 --> 02:05:44.510
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was that,</v>

3048
02:05:44.540 --> 02:05:46.750
<v Speaker 3>that was before Maurice Fought Conan?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3049
02:05:46.870 --> 02:05:47.920
<v Speaker 3>after,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after.</v>

3050
02:05:47.921 --> 02:05:52.921
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maurice had already known that going in </v>

3051
02:05:52.921 --> 02:05:52.921
<v Speaker 3>and out,</v>

3052
02:05:52.921 --> 02:05:54.530
<v Speaker 6>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a key box or knocking somebody out </v>

3053
02:05:54.530 --> 02:05:54.530
<v Speaker 6>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3054
02:05:54.530 --> 02:05:55.620
<v Speaker 6>kind of a given.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But the idea of a Jujitsu guy lose,</v>

3055
02:05:55.660 --> 02:05:58.920
<v Speaker 6>especially to a non Jujitsu fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3056
02:05:59.220 --> 02:06:00.360
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they know what the contributor.</v>

3057
02:06:00.740 --> 02:06:05.040
<v Speaker 6>And I used to get that all the time at </v>
<v Speaker 6>AMC and people would be like introducing</v>

3058
02:06:05.041 --> 02:06:05.910
<v Speaker 6>folks,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what's your belt?</v>

3059
02:06:06.170 --> 02:06:07.380
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't have a belt.</v>

3060
02:06:07.890 --> 02:06:09.750
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what do you do for grappling?</v>

3061
02:06:09.751 --> 02:06:10.580
<v Speaker 6>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

3062
02:06:10.581 --> 02:06:11.340
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we train here,</v>

3063
02:06:11.341 --> 02:06:12.350
<v Speaker 6>we do catch wrestling with,</v>
<v Speaker 6>do they?</v>

3064
02:06:12.460 --> 02:06:13.230
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

3065
02:06:13.231 --> 02:06:14.430
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then we'd roll on it,</v>

3066
02:06:14.460 --> 02:06:18.870
<v Speaker 6>fucking annihilate them and they'd get </v>
<v Speaker 6>so pissed and upset and phony Baloney.</v>

3067
02:06:19.510 --> 02:06:21.180
<v Speaker 6>Unfortunately there are.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But you know,</v>

3068
02:06:21.190 --> 02:06:25.110
<v Speaker 6>that's a wonderful aspect of humanity if</v>
<v Speaker 6>you've got the ability to,</v>

3069
02:06:25.111 --> 02:06:26.640
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to uh,</v>

3070
02:06:26.910 --> 02:06:30.360
<v Speaker 6>to bring truth into the world and be </v>
<v Speaker 6>honest about shit and you know,</v>

3071
02:06:30.361 --> 02:06:32.850
<v Speaker 6>with all the faults and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and also great things about it.</v>

3072
02:06:33.210 --> 02:06:38.210
<v Speaker 6>Most human beings instinct is to go out </v>
<v Speaker 6>there and just lie the fuck out of it </v>

3073
02:06:38.210 --> 02:06:40.770
<v Speaker 6>and just make excuses changed shit </v>
<v Speaker 6>around because you know,</v>

3074
02:06:40.771 --> 02:06:44.010
<v Speaker 6>it's not good enough to just to have </v>
<v Speaker 6>things exist and have it be true.</v>

3075
02:06:44.040 --> 02:06:45.120
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we have to go ahead.</v>

3076
02:06:45.121 --> 02:06:47.400
<v Speaker 6>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>especially shit like religion,</v>

3077
02:06:47.520 --> 02:06:48.540
<v Speaker 6>politics,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's just,</v>

3078
02:06:48.930 --> 02:06:53.930
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let's make a book and call out the word </v>

3079
02:06:53.930 --> 02:06:56.511
<v Speaker 6>of God.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So therefore you can't fucking argue </v>

3080
02:06:56.511 --> 02:06:56.511
<v Speaker 6>against it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Anything that happens.</v>

3081
02:06:56.511 --> 02:06:56.511
<v Speaker 6>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

3082
02:06:56.511 --> 02:06:58.800
<v Speaker 6>the word of God,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the word of God with garbage and then,</v>

3083
02:06:58.801 --> 02:07:03.801
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but essentially have a book that's </v>

3084
02:07:03.801 --> 02:07:03.801
<v Speaker 6>compiled of other books.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The end,</v>

3085
02:07:03.801 --> 02:07:05.490
<v Speaker 6>you decided to leave other random shit </v>
<v Speaker 6>out just because,</v>

3086
02:07:05.491 --> 02:07:06.430
<v Speaker 6>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3087
02:07:06.450 --> 02:07:09.390
<v Speaker 6>it's gone through the hands of all these</v>
<v Speaker 6>other people and all their other agendas</v>

3088
02:07:09.540 --> 02:07:14.540
<v Speaker 6>from Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's because the basic idea of it was a </v>

3089
02:07:15.330 --> 02:07:18.060
<v Speaker 6>human beings all throughout </v>
<v Speaker 6>civilization.</v>

3090
02:07:18.120 --> 02:07:20.670
<v Speaker 6>A full of shit when they flying line </v>
<v Speaker 6>for,</v>

3091
02:07:20.680 --> 02:07:22.320
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>obscuring the truth.</v>

3092
02:07:22.350 --> 02:07:25.650
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of guys that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>don't have belts that are like,</v>

3093
02:07:25.990 --> 02:07:28.560
<v Speaker 6>like super high level.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Matt Hughes,</v>

3094
02:07:28.890 --> 02:07:29.740
<v Speaker 6>Chris Lidell,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Chris,</v>

3095
02:07:30.190 --> 02:07:32.700
<v Speaker 6>we said Chris was a Brazilian jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 6>black belt.</v>

3096
02:07:32.970 --> 02:07:35.770
<v Speaker 6>But apparently that was like even given </v>
<v Speaker 6>it to us press sheets,</v>

3097
02:07:35.771 --> 02:07:36.130
<v Speaker 6>Brazilian</v>

3098
02:07:36.130 --> 02:07:36.880
<v Speaker 2>Jiu Jitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blackbelt,</v>

3099
02:07:36.881 --> 02:07:37.560
<v Speaker 2>Chris Lidell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3100
02:07:37.610 --> 02:07:38.440
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't have any belt.</v>

3101
02:07:38.690 --> 02:07:39.360
<v Speaker 6>Probably not.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

3102
02:07:39.400 --> 02:07:40.340
<v Speaker 6>He trained with those.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

3103
02:07:40.660 --> 02:07:44.170
<v Speaker 6>speaking of a bunch of cats wrestlers </v>
<v Speaker 6>that integrated fighting academy.</v>

3104
02:07:44.800 --> 02:07:45.620
<v Speaker 6>Where,</v>
<v Speaker 6>where was that?</v>

3105
02:07:45.880 --> 02:07:48.740
<v Speaker 6>That was out in Indianapolis.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That was Jason.</v>

3106
02:07:48.741 --> 02:07:49.570
<v Speaker 6>God sees place.</v>

3107
02:07:50.760 --> 02:07:55.760
<v Speaker 2>You're such an interesting case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Knew because you were there like during </v>

3108
02:07:55.760 --> 02:07:55.950
<v Speaker 2>the dark days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you were there,</v>

3109
02:07:55.980 --> 02:08:00.980
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you were there when there was no </v>

3110
02:08:00.980 --> 02:08:03.441
<v Speaker 2>regulation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were there when you were allowed to </v>

3111
02:08:03.441 --> 02:08:03.441
<v Speaker 2>wear shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3112
02:08:03.441 --> 02:08:05.850
<v Speaker 2>like kicking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stopping and that you're still here when</v>

3113
02:08:05.851 --> 02:08:06.230
<v Speaker 2>it's not far.</v>

3114
02:08:06.850 --> 02:08:08.850
<v Speaker 6>The difference is that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3115
02:08:08.851 --> 02:08:11.340
<v Speaker 6>as I've developed as an athlete over the</v>
<v Speaker 6>years,</v>

3116
02:08:11.341 --> 02:08:13.800
<v Speaker 6>but the biggest thing is I developed my </v>
<v Speaker 6>skills.</v>

3117
02:08:14.250 --> 02:08:17.040
<v Speaker 6>So I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Most of these fighters and you know,</v>

3118
02:08:17.041 --> 02:08:18.900
<v Speaker 6>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll say this and I'll say it publicly,</v>

3119
02:08:18.990 --> 02:08:21.660
<v Speaker 6>they have most of these fighters that go</v>
<v Speaker 6>through the system,</v>

3120
02:08:21.661 --> 02:08:23.370
<v Speaker 6>let's say they get good enough that they</v>
<v Speaker 6>get,</v>

3121
02:08:23.371 --> 02:08:24.810
<v Speaker 6>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to get in the UFC and we'll just use the</v>

3122
02:08:24.811 --> 02:08:25.980
<v Speaker 6>UFC is the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>as the,</v>

3123
02:08:25.981 --> 02:08:28.890
<v Speaker 6>as the standard example,</v>
<v Speaker 6>excuse me.</v>

3124
02:08:28.920 --> 02:08:30.410
<v Speaker 6>So what they do is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3125
02:08:30.660 --> 02:08:35.660
<v Speaker 6>they get to a certain point and they get</v>
<v Speaker 6>to enough a skill wise and then they </v>

3126
02:08:35.851 --> 02:08:38.100
<v Speaker 6>just improve their athleticism to such a</v>
<v Speaker 6>degree with.</v>

3127
02:08:38.240 --> 02:08:39.840
<v Speaker 6>They'll get into the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let's say,</v>

3128
02:08:40.140 --> 02:08:45.140
<v Speaker 6>and let's say they're successful,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they probably have about a two to three </v>

3129
02:08:45.931 --> 02:08:48.970
<v Speaker 6>year window if they're good enough to be</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a,</v>

3130
02:08:49.010 --> 02:08:51.240
<v Speaker 6>to a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to get a title or be a title contender.</v>

3131
02:08:51.420 --> 02:08:56.420
<v Speaker 6>If they're that good,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they got about two or three years at </v>

3132
02:08:56.420 --> 02:08:57.540
<v Speaker 6>which they could potentially get a title</v>
<v Speaker 6>or fight for a title.</v>

3133
02:08:58.280 --> 02:09:00.900
<v Speaker 6>And after that then they're never been </v>
<v Speaker 6>declined.</v>

3134
02:09:01.050 --> 02:09:04.860
<v Speaker 6>And then they might still be successful </v>
<v Speaker 6>enough to be still a viable,</v>

3135
02:09:04.920 --> 02:09:09.920
<v Speaker 6>a fighter in the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But even that lasts about is about only </v>

3136
02:09:09.920 --> 02:09:13.610
<v Speaker 6>is about as much as five years.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And after that throw them out because </v>

3137
02:09:13.610 --> 02:09:16.671
<v Speaker 6>they're done.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Their athleticism has dropped enough </v>

3138
02:09:16.671 --> 02:09:16.671
<v Speaker 6>that they don't have the skills to back </v>
<v Speaker 6>it up anymore.</v>

3139
02:09:16.740 --> 02:09:19.800
<v Speaker 6>Most of these fighters just out athlete </v>
<v Speaker 6>the other fighter for the most part.</v>

3140
02:09:20.130 --> 02:09:20.850
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3141
02:09:20.910 --> 02:09:24.510
<v Speaker 6>they even did a big statistic about </v>
<v Speaker 6>fight careers and the,</v>

3142
02:09:24.630 --> 02:09:29.630
<v Speaker 6>once you get to seven years,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the dropoff for success is astronomical </v>

3143
02:09:29.630 --> 02:09:34.020
<v Speaker 6>and the idea of people going 10 years or</v>
<v Speaker 6>15 years like myself,</v>

3144
02:09:34.590 --> 02:09:36.630
<v Speaker 6>unreal,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like it's almost unheard of.</v>

3145
02:09:37.140 --> 02:09:37.800
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>

3146
02:09:38.660 --> 02:09:42.380
<v Speaker 2>well not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you go from age 20 to age 35,</v>

3147
02:09:42.500 --> 02:09:46.370
<v Speaker 6>19 to 35,</v>
<v Speaker 6>19 was my first time against a pro</v>

3148
02:09:47.440 --> 02:09:52.440
<v Speaker 2>and at 35,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're still amongst the top </v>

3149
02:09:52.440 --> 02:09:52.440
<v Speaker 2>heavyweights in the world.</v>

3150
02:09:52.440 --> 02:09:54.440
<v Speaker 6>I could be any of those motherfuckers </v>
<v Speaker 6>out there walking the earth right now.</v>

3151
02:09:55.570 --> 02:09:58.810
<v Speaker 2>If you had to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you,</v>

3152
02:09:58.830 --> 02:10:01.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you had to retire for any reason,</v>

3153
02:10:01.450 --> 02:10:04.390
<v Speaker 2>would you start coaching because I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would have a lot to offer.</v>

3154
02:10:04.420 --> 02:10:06.040
<v Speaker 2>I think you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have,</v>

3155
02:10:06.050 --> 02:10:09.190
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the fact that you've gotten through</v>

3156
02:10:09.191 --> 02:10:12.070
<v Speaker 2>15 years at a very high level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3157
02:10:12.071 --> 02:10:15.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean from your time and pride to </v>
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>

3158
02:10:15.011 --> 02:10:15.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>

3159
02:10:15.810 --> 02:10:18.610
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot of God damn competition </v>
<v Speaker 2>against very high level guys.</v>

3160
02:10:19.330 --> 02:10:22.990
<v Speaker 2>You didn't have a lot of shit that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could teach kids that could cut out.</v>

3161
02:10:23.020 --> 02:10:28.020
<v Speaker 2>Like you see like a lot of people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are being coached and being coached by </v>

3162
02:10:28.020 --> 02:10:31.801
<v Speaker 2>people that don't have nearly the kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of experience that you have and you see </v>

3163
02:10:31.801 --> 02:10:31.801
<v Speaker 2>some mistakes they're making with young </v>
<v Speaker 2>talent.</v>

3164
02:10:31.801 --> 02:10:31.801
<v Speaker 2>Sure,</v>

3165
02:10:31.801 --> 02:10:33.380
<v Speaker 6>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I see a lot of mistakes.</v>

3166
02:10:33.381 --> 02:10:38.381
<v Speaker 6>And in terms of coaching,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's not just even about technique </v>

3167
02:10:38.381 --> 02:10:38.540
<v Speaker 6>necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A lot of it is they,</v>

3168
02:10:38.700 --> 02:10:43.700
<v Speaker 6>they create a system and they think that</v>
<v Speaker 6>everybody has to fit within that system </v>

3169
02:10:43.700 --> 02:10:44.870
<v Speaker 6>and that there is no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there is no wavering from that system.</v>

3170
02:10:44.871 --> 02:10:47.690
<v Speaker 6>And the thing is not any.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everybody is different.</v>

3171
02:10:48.050 --> 02:10:50.540
<v Speaker 6>Everybody's an individual and everybody </v>
<v Speaker 6>needs to be coached differently.</v>

3172
02:10:50.541 --> 02:10:53.180
<v Speaker 6>I've had a and I have coached through </v>
<v Speaker 6>the years and I've,</v>

3173
02:10:53.181 --> 02:10:55.670
<v Speaker 6>I've coached people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the world championship fights,</v>

3174
02:10:55.700 --> 02:10:57.680
<v Speaker 6>I've coached people to the world titles.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've had a,</v>

3175
02:10:57.681 --> 02:11:02.681
<v Speaker 6>I think I've had more women at one time </v>
<v Speaker 6>ranked in the top 10 and some,</v>

3176
02:11:03.010 --> 02:11:08.010
<v Speaker 6>most of them ranked in the top five of </v>
<v Speaker 6>the world and their respective way </v>

3177
02:11:08.010 --> 02:11:11.471
<v Speaker 6>classes than any other coach.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then the baby food Fuji was making </v>

3178
02:11:11.471 --> 02:11:11.471
<v Speaker 6>Fuji Jenelle Marquez.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Shana Bassler.</v>

3179
02:11:11.500 --> 02:11:12.400
<v Speaker 6>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're going to hit told me,</v>

3180
02:11:12.401 --> 02:11:14.300
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3181
02:11:14.930 --> 02:11:16.760
<v Speaker 6>let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

3182
02:11:16.800 --> 02:11:18.230
<v Speaker 2>so are you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you want you,</v>

3183
02:11:18.370 --> 02:11:20.130
<v Speaker 2>that what you want to do when you start </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting?</v>

3184
02:11:20.200 --> 02:11:21.020
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3185
02:11:21.670 --> 02:11:26.670
<v Speaker 2>because I was thinking that you didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know a real shame because there's not a </v>

3186
02:11:26.670 --> 02:11:31.521
<v Speaker 2>lot of guys who are fighters but have </v>
<v Speaker 2>also taken the time to really sort of </v>

3187
02:11:32.641 --> 02:11:35.470
<v Speaker 2>intellectually breakdown the properties </v>
<v Speaker 2>of creating a fight.</v>

3188
02:11:35.510 --> 02:11:40.510
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to be a coach like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just don't because if I'm going to be </v>

3189
02:11:41.720 --> 02:11:46.720
<v Speaker 6>a coach,</v>
<v Speaker 6>think of it more as like an old school </v>

3190
02:11:46.720 --> 02:11:48.080
<v Speaker 6>boxing coach or maybe one of these old </v>
<v Speaker 6>catch coaches where you only really,</v>

3191
02:11:48.200 --> 02:11:53.200
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Someone proves to you enough that </v>

3192
02:11:53.200 --> 02:11:53.390
<v Speaker 6>they're worth giving that kind of time </v>
<v Speaker 6>and information.</v>

3193
02:11:53.391 --> 02:11:56.510
<v Speaker 6>I don't just look at it as well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm just going to show you some move.</v>

3194
02:11:56.960 --> 02:12:00.110
<v Speaker 6>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this move came from this coach came from</v>

3195
02:12:00.111 --> 02:12:05.111
<v Speaker 6>that coach came.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you know how many hundreds of years </v>

3196
02:12:05.111 --> 02:12:07.241
<v Speaker 6>of development came behind this?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you know how difficult it was for </v>

3197
02:12:07.241 --> 02:12:11.591
<v Speaker 6>someone to the original person down the </v>
<v Speaker 6>line to get this thing to me with the </v>

3198
02:12:11.591 --> 02:12:14.831
<v Speaker 6>shit that they had to go through and to </v>
<v Speaker 6>live their life and to harness these </v>

3199
02:12:14.831 --> 02:12:16.370
<v Speaker 6>techniques and give them to me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>These things are precious,</v>

3200
02:12:16.970 --> 02:12:20.590
<v Speaker 2>so I understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when I see a guy like you and I see,</v>

3201
02:12:20.591 --> 02:12:22.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have 35 years of age.</v>

3202
02:12:22.301 --> 02:12:24.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean totally respectfully and </v>
<v Speaker 2>honestly.</v>

3203
02:12:24.881 --> 02:12:26.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you got five years left?</v>

3204

<v Speaker 2>Jones type character,</v>

<v Speaker 2>next level.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

3213
02:12:49.660 --> 02:12:51.400
<v Speaker 2>Jon Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it an anomaly?</v>

3214
02:12:51.401 --> 02:12:53.200
<v Speaker 2>He's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a bad motherfucker.</v>

3215
02:12:53.230 --> 02:12:54.820
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody could make him good.</v>

3216
02:12:54.850 --> 02:12:57.160
<v Speaker 2>Yes and no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

3217
02:12:57.220 --> 02:13:02.220
<v Speaker 2>and without a doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mike Winkeljohn has done some amazing </v>

3218
02:13:02.220 --> 02:13:03.880
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Without a doubt.</v>

3219
02:13:03.881 --> 02:13:05.200
<v Speaker 2>He's brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Without a doubt,</v>

3220
02:13:05.201 --> 02:13:07.080
<v Speaker 2>John is a prodigy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>John is a.</v>

3221
02:13:07.120 --> 02:13:11.260
<v Speaker 2>he's a very intense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful human being.</v>

3222
02:13:11.290 --> 02:13:13.840
<v Speaker 2>John Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>besides his physicality,</v>

3223
02:13:13.841 --> 02:13:17.380
<v Speaker 2>which is obviously very gifted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his mind is very powerful and I think he</v>

3224
02:13:17.381 --> 02:13:20.290
<v Speaker 2>would be great that he would figure it </v>
<v Speaker 2>out watching other people,</v>

3225
02:13:20.291 --> 02:13:21.460
<v Speaker 2>no matter who was coaching,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

3226
02:13:21.461 --> 02:13:23.800
<v Speaker 2>he's the kind of guy that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>excel no matter what.</v>

3227
02:13:23.890 --> 02:13:27.700
<v Speaker 2>But having a guy like Winkeljohn who's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>brilliant striking code,</v>

3228
02:13:27.710 --> 02:13:30.230
<v Speaker 2>they really different being</v>

3229
02:13:30.230 --> 02:13:32.030
<v Speaker 6>somebody that like,</v>

3230
02:13:32.030 --> 02:13:37.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>taking that middle of the pack guy and </v>

3231
02:13:37.030 --> 02:13:39.771
<v Speaker 3>that one and developing them into a </v>
<v Speaker 3>world champion that's always going to </v>

3232
02:13:39.771 --> 02:13:39.810
<v Speaker 3>get that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll never be.</v>

3233
02:13:39.900 --> 02:13:40.860
<v Speaker 3>But it depends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3234
02:13:40.870 --> 02:13:42.150
<v Speaker 3>and that's what I'm saying is I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to.</v>

3235
02:13:42.360 --> 02:13:44.370
<v Speaker 3>Because there's a lot going on there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3236
02:13:44.860 --> 02:13:47.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm not talking necessarily about who I </v>
<v Speaker 3>would coach.</v>

3237
02:13:47.221 --> 02:13:49.110
<v Speaker 3>You just be like the ones that just </v>
<v Speaker 3>shine as.</v>

3238
02:13:49.111 --> 02:13:50.370
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to coach.</v>

3239
02:13:50.371 --> 02:13:52.530
<v Speaker 3>I would coach a person that I feel </v>
<v Speaker 3>personality,</v>

3240
02:13:52.531 --> 02:13:57.531
<v Speaker 3>integrity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>character mentality as well as </v>

3241
02:13:57.531 --> 02:13:59.190
<v Speaker 3>physicality all matches what I think is </v>
<v Speaker 3>worth investing the time into.</v>

3242
02:13:59.400 --> 02:14:00.900
<v Speaker 3>So you would do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they would have to.</v>

3243
02:14:00.920 --> 02:14:05.920
<v Speaker 3>He'd be like special people came onto up</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the mountain top when you're alone </v>

3244
02:14:05.920 --> 02:14:07.820
<v Speaker 3>fucking chopping wood and then you will </v>
<v Speaker 3>make them like fences and shit.</v>

3245
02:14:08.270 --> 02:14:09.020
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3246
02:14:09.021 --> 02:14:12.320
<v Speaker 6>I wax on carbon carbon.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Some ruins into their body.</v>

3247

<v Speaker 3>But I just,</v>

3278
02:15:24.441 --> 02:15:26.510
<v Speaker 3>as a coach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so much investment</v>

3279
02:15:26.650 --> 02:15:30.110
<v Speaker 6>goes into that and that it's not </v>
<v Speaker 6>something I'm,</v>

3280
02:15:30.170 --> 02:15:32.700
<v Speaker 6>I'm not saying I won't coach.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

3281
02:15:32.710 --> 02:15:36.500
<v Speaker 6>and if the availability is there a and </v>
<v Speaker 6>the possibility is there,</v>

3282
02:15:36.530 --> 02:15:39.450

<v Speaker 6>I got a lot of Shit,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I'm ready.</v>

3321
02:17:01.580 --> 02:17:04.090
<v Speaker 5>If you had the girl like where you go so</v>
<v Speaker 5>far and they start like puking,</v>

3322
02:17:04.100 --> 02:17:09.100
<v Speaker 5>like the stomach acid all over your </v>
<v Speaker 5>mouth during the porn movies today in </v>

3324
02:17:10.500 --> 02:17:15.500
<v Speaker 5>They got to relax yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess to get these girls to throw up </v>

3325
02:17:15.500 --> 02:17:15.500
<v Speaker 5>on your Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's like bio and stuff.</v>

3326
02:17:16.230 --> 02:17:19.180
<v Speaker 5>It feels good actually.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's awesome.</v>

3327
02:17:19.310 --> 02:17:20.260
<v Speaker 5>What if they don't?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3328
02:17:20.330 --> 02:17:25.330
<v Speaker 5>if those girls don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't watch their diet and they're </v>

3329
02:17:25.330 --> 02:17:27.710
<v Speaker 5>probably like all anorexic and signs of </v>
<v Speaker 5>like weird cat food all over it.</v>

3330
02:17:29.750 --> 02:17:31.590
<v Speaker 5>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are you talking about cat food?</v>

3331
02:17:31.880 --> 02:17:33.560
<v Speaker 5>Maybe I'd eight different girls.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you do,</v>

3332
02:17:33.710 --> 02:17:38.710

<v Speaker 5>There are so finicky.</v>

3334
02:17:41.910 --> 02:17:42.950
<v Speaker 5>You did it again.</v>

3335
02:17:44.060 --> 02:17:45.820
<v Speaker 6>It took it to a bad place.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Where,</v>

3336
02:17:45.821 --> 02:17:50.821
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>where were we going with this before we </v>

3337
02:17:50.821 --> 02:17:50.821
<v Speaker 6>got on a blow jobs and small Dicks,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

3338
02:17:50.821 --> 02:17:54.790
<v Speaker 6>Terrible places.</v>
<v Speaker 6>One of the things that you wanted to </v>

3339
02:17:54.790 --> 02:17:54.790
<v Speaker 6>talk about when you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

3340
02:17:54.790 --> 02:17:54.790
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3341
02:17:54.790 --> 02:17:59.160
<v Speaker 6>contacted me about coming on the podcast</v>
<v Speaker 6>is all this craziness that's going on </v>

3342
02:17:59.160 --> 02:18:01.300
<v Speaker 6>with all these school shootings and </v>
<v Speaker 6>school shootings.</v>

3343
02:18:01.301 --> 02:18:01.800
<v Speaker 6>It was the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3344
02:18:01.801 --> 02:18:06.801
<v Speaker 6>the Oregon shooting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guess that one was in a mall and all </v>

3345
02:18:06.801 --> 02:18:06.801
<v Speaker 6>this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3346
02:18:06.801 --> 02:18:11.570
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and the interesting thing about the </v>

3347
02:18:11.570 --> 02:18:11.570
<v Speaker 6>mall,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one that's coming out now is that he was</v>

3348
02:18:11.570 --> 02:18:13.900
<v Speaker 6>confronted by an armed civilian and </v>
<v Speaker 6>that's when he shot himself.</v>

3349
02:18:14.530 --> 02:18:17.680
<v Speaker 6>And that's not something that's being </v>
<v Speaker 6>talked about very much.</v>

3350
02:18:18.190 --> 02:18:23.190
<v Speaker 6>Why would they?</v>
<v Speaker 6>That doesn't work with the agenda at </v>

3351
02:18:23.190 --> 02:18:23.190
<v Speaker 6>hand of why.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you know,</v>

3352
02:18:23.190 --> 02:18:24.070
<v Speaker 6>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's hard of a problem,</v>

3353
02:18:24.071 --> 02:18:29.071
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>A huge problem is that we've got media </v>

3354
02:18:29.071 --> 02:18:29.790
<v Speaker 6>that wants to just create knee jerk </v>
<v Speaker 6>reactions and emotional responses.</v>

3355
02:18:29.800 --> 02:18:33.610
<v Speaker 6>They don't care about trying to deliver </v>
<v Speaker 6>a whole unbiased story.</v>

3356
02:18:33.611 --> 02:18:38.500
<v Speaker 6>They've each got an agenda to try and </v>
<v Speaker 6>put a rift in the populace at general at</v>

3357
02:18:38.501 --> 02:18:43.501
<v Speaker 6>large.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's fucking irresponsible and is </v>

3358
02:18:43.501 --> 02:18:43.501
<v Speaker 6>terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was listening to a,</v>

3359
02:18:43.501 --> 02:18:48.220
<v Speaker 6>something that would come on about a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was either MSNBC or CNN and after the</v>

3360
02:18:48.221 --> 02:18:49.750
<v Speaker 6>horrible Sandy Hook,</v>
<v Speaker 6>tragedy,</v>

3361
02:18:50.170 --> 02:18:51.670
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one of the teachers,</v>

3362
02:18:52.120 --> 02:18:57.120
<v Speaker 6>boyfriends have a year.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They found him and started giving their </v>

3363
02:18:57.120 --> 02:18:58.670
<v Speaker 6>full interview on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm just going,</v>

3364
02:18:59.280 --> 02:19:01.630
<v Speaker 6>why I don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is completely one.</v>

3365
02:19:01.631 --> 02:19:04.480
<v Speaker 6>It's just giving more prudent credence </v>
<v Speaker 6>to,</v>

3366
02:19:04.750 --> 02:19:09.750
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you want to do something crazy and be </v>

3367
02:19:09.750 --> 02:19:09.820
<v Speaker 6>fucking famous forever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Here's more publicity for you.</v>

3368
02:19:09.821 --> 02:19:10.200
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

3369
02:19:10.210 --> 02:19:12.310
<v Speaker 6>you didn't have anything else better to </v>
<v Speaker 6>do than talk to a guy.</v>

3370
02:19:12.311 --> 02:19:14.020
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I knew her for a year.</v>

3371
02:19:14.021 --> 02:19:17.170
<v Speaker 6>And like you were some guy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some guy for a year,</v>

3372
02:19:17.540 --> 02:19:19.480
<v Speaker 6>it wasn't even crying,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like you didn't even miss her.</v>

3373
02:19:19.680 --> 02:19:21.790
<v Speaker 6>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was no big deal and he was on CNN.</v>

3374
02:19:21.791 --> 02:19:23.220
<v Speaker 6>Maybe he really did fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3375
02:19:23.280 --> 02:19:24.970
<v Speaker 6>he was super torn up about it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever.</v>

3376
02:19:24.971 --> 02:19:28.100
<v Speaker 6>But it doesn't fucking matter because </v>
<v Speaker 6>why are you on TV?</v>

3377
02:19:28.101 --> 02:19:31.880
<v Speaker 6>Why is the news finding that to be </v>
<v Speaker 6>important to talk about?</v>

3378
02:19:31.881 --> 02:19:34.070
<v Speaker 6>Why shouldn't we be talking about </v>
<v Speaker 6>something more important?</v>

3379
02:19:34.071 --> 02:19:39.071
<v Speaker 6>Like why is our culture devolving in </v>
<v Speaker 6>such a way that people are acting in </v>

3380
02:19:39.861 --> 02:19:44.861
<v Speaker 6>such manner,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whether they're shooting people or </v>

3381
02:19:44.861 --> 02:19:48.340
<v Speaker 6>fucking stabbing them or robbing them or</v>
<v Speaker 6>car jacking him and taking them back to </v>

3382
02:19:48.340 --> 02:19:50.660
<v Speaker 6>a place and raping and torturing him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like what the fuck is going on?</v>

3383
02:19:50.661 --> 02:19:52.660
<v Speaker 6>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why is humanity at large doing this kind</v>

3384
02:19:52.661 --> 02:19:53.810
<v Speaker 6>of shit?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then the other thing,</v>

3385
02:19:54.200 --> 02:19:59.200
<v Speaker 6>so another channel.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm sitting here and I just hear it </v>

3386
02:19:59.200 --> 02:20:00.860
<v Speaker 6>coming into the ears and I hear they're </v>
<v Speaker 6>talking about how some Republican,</v>

3387
02:20:00.861 --> 02:20:01.400

3389
02:20:06.401 --> 02:20:06.401
<v Speaker 6>like 17 times.</v>

3390
02:20:06.401 --> 02:20:06.401
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>every,</v>

<v Speaker 6>make.</v>

3392
02:20:07.281 --> 02:20:09.280
<v Speaker 6>He's really trying to pin,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3393
02:20:09.320 --> 02:20:13.410
<v Speaker 6>pound something home with his lingo and </v>
<v Speaker 6>then there's a,</v>

<v Speaker 6>she'll probably be back ended with all </v>

3397
02:20:24.161 --> 02:20:24.161
<v Speaker 6>kinds of shit that have nothing to do </v>
<v Speaker 6>with it,</v>

3398
02:20:24.161 --> 02:20:25.610
<v Speaker 6>which they always do,</v>

3419
02:21:12.310 --> 02:21:14.030
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But people will sell guns,</v>

3420
02:21:14.070 --> 02:21:15.740
<v Speaker 6>not at gun shows.</v>

3433
02:21:49.720 --> 02:21:54.440
<v Speaker 6>the ammunition manufacturers that sell </v>
<v Speaker 6>this stuff through my dad's own research</v>

3434
02:21:54.441 --> 02:21:55.370
<v Speaker 6>on certain,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know.</v>

3435
02:21:55.370 --> 02:22:00.370
<v Speaker 6>And the thing is every firearm that </v>
<v Speaker 6>you're doing this for is entirely </v>

3436
02:22:00.370 --> 02:22:01.010
<v Speaker 6>different.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You could have three,</v>

3437
02:22:01.011 --> 02:22:01.700
<v Speaker 6>19,</v>
<v Speaker 6>11,</v>

3438
02:22:01.701 --> 02:22:03.980
<v Speaker 6>45,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all the same barrel length,</v>

3439
02:22:03.981 --> 02:22:08.981
<v Speaker 6>all the same manufacturer,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they're not all going to shoot the </v>

3440
02:22:08.981 --> 02:22:11.711
<v Speaker 6>same.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not exactly in one load is going to </v>

3441
02:22:11.711 --> 02:22:13.931
<v Speaker 6>shoot different than the other other.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Some bullet weights depending on barrel </v>

3442
02:22:13.931 --> 02:22:15.440
<v Speaker 6>length.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The amount of rifling has gone nuts.</v>

3443
02:22:15.620 --> 02:22:16.910
<v Speaker 6>I'm a gun nut.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

3444
02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:18.710
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3445
02:22:18.711 --> 02:22:21.710
<v Speaker 6>I grew up not only with that but my dad </v>
<v Speaker 6>inherited from,</v>

3446
02:22:21.711 --> 02:22:24.400
<v Speaker 6>from people in his life,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the hobby of,</v>

3447
02:22:24.430 --> 02:22:27.240
<v Speaker 6>of target shooting and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

3448
02:22:27.330 --> 02:22:32.330
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>gun smithing and creating your and just </v>

3449
02:22:32.330 --> 02:22:32.330
<v Speaker 6>being a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just a nerd about guns.</v>

3450
02:22:32.340 --> 02:22:36.210
<v Speaker 6>Like I'm a nerd about cars,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he was a hunter.</v>

3451
02:22:36.420 --> 02:22:38.250
<v Speaker 6>And when,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when,</v>

3452
02:22:38.251 --> 02:22:39.420
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and he was growing up,</v>

3453
02:22:39.421 --> 02:22:42.140
<v Speaker 6>that's what you did.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He grew up in the fucking woods of,</v>

3454
02:22:42.340 --> 02:22:44.610
<v Speaker 6>of southwestern Washington.</v>

3455
02:22:44.890 --> 02:22:49.890
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he was a logger from as early as he </v>

3456
02:22:49.890 --> 02:22:49.890
<v Speaker 6>could.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He worked in paper mills.</v>

3457
02:22:49.890 --> 02:22:51.780
<v Speaker 6>He's been in the forest all his whole </v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking life almost.</v>

3458
02:22:51.781 --> 02:22:54.090
<v Speaker 6>And so hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fishing game,</v>

3459
02:22:54.120 --> 02:22:55.880
<v Speaker 6>all that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>

3460
02:22:56.130 --> 02:23:01.130
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've been out there in the woods with </v>

3461
02:23:01.130 --> 02:23:01.130
<v Speaker 6>him since I was a kid going hunting and </v>
<v Speaker 6>catch,</v>

3462
02:23:01.130 --> 02:23:01.620
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>getting animals,</v>

3463
02:23:01.770 --> 02:23:03.090
<v Speaker 6>cleaning them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>dressing.</v>

3464
02:23:03.091 --> 02:23:05.760
<v Speaker 6>I'm going through the whole process and </v>
<v Speaker 6>I can tell you one thing.</v>

3465
02:23:06.090 --> 02:23:11.090
<v Speaker 6>Fucking being a hunter and being </v>
<v Speaker 6>somebody that had spent so much time in </v>

3466
02:23:11.090 --> 02:23:11.790
<v Speaker 6>the wilderness and Anon,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the Anon,</v>

3467
02:23:11.791 --> 02:23:16.791
<v Speaker 6>the ocean and boats fishing and all this</v>
<v Speaker 6>made me appreciate nature like a </v>

3468
02:23:16.791 --> 02:23:20.220
<v Speaker 6>gazillion times more than I think </v>
<v Speaker 6>anybody that doesn't necessarily.</v>

3469
02:23:20.221 --> 02:23:25.221
<v Speaker 6>I think nature is something that is </v>
<v Speaker 6>overlooked huge and I don't think we as </v>

3470
02:23:25.770 --> 02:23:30.770
<v Speaker 6>humans sometimes really understand the </v>
<v Speaker 6>vastness and the impressiveness of of </v>

3471
02:23:31.141 --> 02:23:36.141
<v Speaker 6>mother earth as a general and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>being out there in the mountains and </v>

3472
02:23:36.141 --> 02:23:37.080
<v Speaker 6>seeing the animals and the uniting when </v>
<v Speaker 6>you're hunting them.</v>

3473
02:23:37.080 --> 02:23:42.080
<v Speaker 6>Just being involved in this whole </v>
<v Speaker 6>process and just knowing them and then </v>

3474
02:23:42.080 --> 02:23:43.610
<v Speaker 6>taking an animal and going through that </v>
<v Speaker 6>whole process of,</v>

3475
02:23:43.640 --> 02:23:48.640
<v Speaker 6>of all the care and responsibility that </v>
<v Speaker 6>comes to to do this correctly and then </v>

3476
02:23:48.640 --> 02:23:50.060
<v Speaker 6>serve this meat to other people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And when,</v>

3477
02:23:50.080 --> 02:23:52.710
<v Speaker 6>when my family didn't have money,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when they're broke as fuck.</v>

3478
02:23:52.800 --> 02:23:57.800
<v Speaker 6>The animals that my dad had caught help </v>
<v Speaker 6>feed that family that my.</v>

3479
02:23:58.670 --> 02:24:03.670
<v Speaker 6>They're all broke living in this little </v>
<v Speaker 6>apartment in north Seattle and no </v>

3480
02:24:03.670 --> 02:24:08.200
<v Speaker 6>unexcused.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They go out there with their tags and </v>

3481
02:24:08.200 --> 02:24:08.200
<v Speaker 6>they'd get their,</v>
<v Speaker 6>their,</v>

3482
02:24:08.200 --> 02:24:08.200
<v Speaker 6>their,</v>
<v Speaker 6>their elk or they get their deer.</v>

3483
02:24:08.200 --> 02:24:09.480
<v Speaker 6>They would,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they would catch fish,</v>

3484
02:24:09.481 --> 02:24:11.080
<v Speaker 6>they would grouse all the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3485
02:24:11.100 --> 02:24:12.870
<v Speaker 6>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that all went onto the table,</v>

3486
02:24:13.410 --> 02:24:15.160
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and that was a big part of that,</v>

3487
02:24:15.240 --> 02:24:19.560
<v Speaker 6>that growing up for me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so I've had gun responsibility.</v>

3488
02:24:19.770 --> 02:24:24.540
<v Speaker 6>I've been shooting since I was a kid and</v>
<v Speaker 6>being a responsible parent is why,</v>

3489
02:24:24.960 --> 02:24:29.960
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>from the get like one guns were always </v>

3490
02:24:29.960 --> 02:24:29.960
<v Speaker 6>locked up.</v>

3491
02:24:29.960 --> 02:24:34.360
<v Speaker 6>They're always in safes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know how to get into these </v>

3492
02:24:34.360 --> 02:24:34.470
<v Speaker 6>fucking things.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not allowed access to this shit as a</v>

3493
02:24:34.471 --> 02:24:37.240
<v Speaker 6>child or even as an 18 year old,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like that ain't happening.</v>

3494
02:24:37.260 --> 02:24:42.260
<v Speaker 6>Like I didn't know that the combination </v>
<v Speaker 6>to my dad's gun safe until I was almost </v>

3495
02:24:42.691 --> 02:24:44.910
<v Speaker 6>30 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know what I mean?</v>

3496
02:24:44.970 --> 02:24:48.660
<v Speaker 6>And other than that mean if there was a </v>
<v Speaker 6>possibility,</v>

3497
02:24:48.661 --> 02:24:50.700
<v Speaker 6>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I didn't know because this was never</v>

3498
02:24:50.701 --> 02:24:55.701
<v Speaker 6>spoken about,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if there was even the potential that </v>

3499
02:24:55.701 --> 02:24:55.800
<v Speaker 6>there was a firearm,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let's say for home defense,</v>

3500
02:24:55.801 --> 02:24:58.170
<v Speaker 6>that was somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let's say in my parents room,</v>

3501
02:24:58.200 --> 02:25:01.650
<v Speaker 6>but I didn't know about through the fear</v>
<v Speaker 6>of fucking God,</v>

3502
02:25:01.651 --> 02:25:06.651
<v Speaker 6>I wouldn't step in there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My Dad had me so afraid of fucking with </v>

3503
02:25:06.651 --> 02:25:10.860
<v Speaker 6>his shit or anything in their room as a </v>
<v Speaker 6>responsible parent.</v>

3504
02:25:10.920 --> 02:25:13.710
<v Speaker 6>That never happened.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I knew fucking way better.</v>

3505
02:25:13.711 --> 02:25:18.711
<v Speaker 6>And the idea if I ever,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if he ever found out if I ever laid </v>

3506
02:25:18.711 --> 02:25:21.060
<v Speaker 6>hands on a gun that he wasn't around.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Alright,</v>

3507
02:25:21.080 --> 02:25:24.320
<v Speaker 6>well you what you're ascribing sounds </v>
<v Speaker 6>like an ideal situation</v>

3508
02:25:24.350 --> 02:25:27.590
<v Speaker 2>to grow up and raise someone in an </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment where you teach them firearm</v>

3509
02:25:27.591 --> 02:25:30.590
<v Speaker 2>safety and respect for firearms and </v>
<v Speaker 2>appreciation for firearm.</v>

3510
02:25:30.600 --> 02:25:32.750
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The real debate is not that though.</v>

3511
02:25:32.751 --> 02:25:35.000
<v Speaker 2>The real debate is the fact that if the </v>
<v Speaker 2>guns are out there,</v>

3512
02:25:35.001 --> 02:25:40.001
<v Speaker 2>it's not just you and you're responsible</v>
<v Speaker 2>parents that are going to have these </v>

3513
02:25:40.001 --> 02:25:43.241
<v Speaker 2>guns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's this crazy motherfucker in </v>

3514
02:25:43.241 --> 02:25:43.241
<v Speaker 2>Connecticut and is nutty mother that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>killed.</v>

3515
02:25:43.241 --> 02:25:45.230
<v Speaker 2>And then took her guns and shot up all </v>
<v Speaker 2>those poor kids.</v>

3516
02:25:45.260 --> 02:25:50.260
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the where the real issue comes </v>

3517
02:25:50.260 --> 02:25:50.260
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3518
02:25:50.260 --> 02:25:50.660
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you stop that from happening?</v>

3519
02:25:50.720 --> 02:25:51.380
<v Speaker 6>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

3520
02:25:51.381 --> 02:25:52.130
<v Speaker 6>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3521
02:25:52.210 --> 02:25:55.700
<v Speaker 6>and through through all this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I'm a time spent,</v>

3522
02:25:55.740 --> 02:25:57.860
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>actually having firearms as a hobby.</v>

3523
02:25:58.640 --> 02:25:59.200
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3524
02:25:59.490 --> 02:26:04.490
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I ended up working in the industry of </v>

3525
02:26:04.490 --> 02:26:06.530
<v Speaker 6>selling firearms and buying them through</v>
<v Speaker 6>a thrift shop and,</v>

3526
02:26:06.531 --> 02:26:07.550
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in Washington.</v>

3527
02:26:07.580 --> 02:26:12.580
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can tell you like everything that went</v>

3528
02:26:12.921 --> 02:26:15.350
<v Speaker 6>through that shop,</v>
<v Speaker 6>everything that was ever done all had to</v>

3529
02:26:15.351 --> 02:26:17.900
<v Speaker 6>go through the federal program,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

3530
02:26:19.050 --> 02:26:21.230
<v Speaker 6>the instant criminal,</v>
<v Speaker 6>national,</v>

3531
02:26:21.231 --> 02:26:22.730
<v Speaker 6>instant criminal background check </v>
<v Speaker 6>system.</v>

3532
02:26:22.731 --> 02:26:27.590
<v Speaker 6>The Knicks and I had to call in every </v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking thing every single time.</v>

3533
02:26:27.770 --> 02:26:30.420
<v Speaker 6>And this whole thing was insistent in pr</v>
<v Speaker 6>in,</v>

3534
02:26:30.500 --> 02:26:35.500
<v Speaker 6>in the system for a reason.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I can't say that it's perfect </v>

3535
02:26:35.500 --> 02:26:37.010
<v Speaker 6>because I know it ain't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a federal government,</v>

3536
02:26:37.011 --> 02:26:38.540
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's no way that it's perfect.</v>

3537
02:26:38.541 --> 02:26:39.430
<v Speaker 6>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3538
02:26:39.440 --> 02:26:41.870
<v Speaker 6>reading the information on Nick's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3539
02:26:41.871 --> 02:26:42.790
<v Speaker 6>they like to claim that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3540
02:26:42.791 --> 02:26:43.430
<v Speaker 6>over,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3541
02:26:43.431 --> 02:26:44.720
<v Speaker 6>since uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>being put in,</v>

3542
02:26:44.721 --> 02:26:48.140
<v Speaker 6>in [inaudible] 93,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a over 100 million checks in the</v>

3543
02:26:48.140 --> 02:26:49.460
<v Speaker 6>last decade leading the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 6>700,000</v>

3544
02:26:49.490 --> 02:26:52.310
<v Speaker 6>denials of firearms in the hands of </v>
<v Speaker 6>people that it shouldn't be.</v>

3545
02:26:52.700 --> 02:26:57.700
<v Speaker 6>But the problem is that you look at some</v>
<v Speaker 6>of this stuff and what the things that </v>

3546
02:26:57.700 --> 02:27:00.761
<v Speaker 6>they might deny you for sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 6>there's the simple issue of I'm a </v>

3547
02:27:01.861 --> 02:27:04.610
<v Speaker 6>concealed weapons owner or a permit </v>
<v Speaker 6>holder in Washington,</v>

3548
02:27:04.611 --> 02:27:06.440
<v Speaker 6>which means I already had to go through </v>
<v Speaker 6>fingerprinting.</v>

3549
02:27:06.441 --> 02:27:11.441
<v Speaker 6>I had to fill out all this paperwork.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I had to go through a process and get </v>

3550
02:27:11.441 --> 02:27:11.450
<v Speaker 6>approved to get my concealed weapons </v>
<v Speaker 6>permit.</v>

3551
02:27:12.170 --> 02:27:14.360
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when that meant,</v>

3552
02:27:14.361 --> 02:27:17.420
<v Speaker 6>when I went to a gun store,</v>
<v Speaker 6>even the one I worked at a,</v>

3553
02:27:17.421 --> 02:27:22.421
<v Speaker 6>if I want to purchase a handgun,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which normally has a waiting period </v>

3554
02:27:22.421 --> 02:27:23.240
<v Speaker 6>because I'm a concealed weapons permit </v>
<v Speaker 6>holder and I've already gone through all</v>

3555
02:27:23.241 --> 02:27:28.241
<v Speaker 6>these extra checks.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I fill out all the paperwork like </v>

3556
02:27:28.241 --> 02:27:28.241
<v Speaker 6>everyone else had.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All gets filed with the serial number of</v>

3557
02:27:28.241 --> 02:27:30.260
<v Speaker 6>the gun.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And what I'm purchasing and so on and so</v>

3558
02:27:30.261 --> 02:27:35.261
<v Speaker 6>forth and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I still go through the next check </v>

3559
02:27:35.261 --> 02:27:37.900
<v Speaker 6>list like everybody else,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but because there was somebody in </v>

3560
02:27:37.900 --> 02:27:42.070
<v Speaker 6>California who had a similar name to </v>
<v Speaker 6>mind every time I would call in with my </v>

3561
02:27:42.070 --> 02:27:43.820
<v Speaker 6>social security number of my weapons </v>
<v Speaker 6>license number,</v>

3562
02:27:43.821 --> 02:27:48.080
<v Speaker 6>like all this different information and </v>
<v Speaker 6>data for at least three years.</v>

3563
02:27:48.440 --> 02:27:52.190
<v Speaker 6>I was always put on a hold with every </v>
<v Speaker 6>firearm I bought.</v>

3564
02:27:52.191 --> 02:27:55.700
<v Speaker 6>And even if that included a rifle,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is normally a same day thing after</v>

3565
02:27:55.701 --> 02:28:00.701
<v Speaker 6>nick's all every single time because </v>
<v Speaker 6>they would always see that there's some </v>

3566
02:28:00.701 --> 02:28:05.140
<v Speaker 6>stuff in it and they will always in.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The thing about it is the fact that </v>

3567
02:28:05.140 --> 02:28:07.220
<v Speaker 6>there's a hold put on that could last </v>
<v Speaker 6>anywhere from,</v>

3568
02:28:07.470 --> 02:28:12.470
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>three hours they might call back or you </v>

3569
02:28:12.470 --> 02:28:12.470
<v Speaker 6>know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>three days.</v>

3570
02:28:12.470 --> 02:28:13.580
<v Speaker 6>It wasn't having a whole.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That was,</v>

3571
02:28:13.610 --> 02:28:15.620
<v Speaker 6>that ever bothered me whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

3572
02:28:15.621 --> 02:28:16.430
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever.</v>

3573
02:28:16.670 --> 02:28:19.250
<v Speaker 6>It's just that there isn't like why </v>
<v Speaker 6>isn't this not being updated?</v>

3574
02:28:19.251 --> 02:28:24.251
<v Speaker 6>Like you're being given very specific </v>
<v Speaker 6>information about me as a person.</v>

3575
02:28:24.620 --> 02:28:27.400
<v Speaker 6>So I want my,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3576
02:28:27.410 --> 02:28:32.410
<v Speaker 6>if I'm going to have this database is </v>
<v Speaker 6>going to be used to try and be a </v>

3577
02:28:32.410 --> 02:28:36.820
<v Speaker 6>responsible about having firearms,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not in the hands of people that it </v>

3578
02:28:36.820 --> 02:28:36.820
<v Speaker 6>shouldn't be.</v>

3579
02:28:36.820 --> 02:28:39.470
<v Speaker 6>Why are you not updating this enough to </v>
<v Speaker 6>know that I'm not that fucking guy.</v>

3580
02:28:39.680 --> 02:28:44.680
<v Speaker 6>And eventually three years,</v>
<v Speaker 6>two or three years later down the road </v>

3581
02:28:44.680 --> 02:28:45.440
<v Speaker 6>it came about and now that's not the </v>
<v Speaker 6>case anymore for me,</v>

3582
02:28:45.441 --> 02:28:48.440
<v Speaker 6>far as I know I haven't bought a Po,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a purchase a firearm in a long time.</v>

3583
02:28:48.830 --> 02:28:53.830
<v Speaker 6>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then when it came to going to gun </v>

3584
02:28:53.830 --> 02:28:53.830
<v Speaker 6>shows,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which I've been a member,</v>

3585
02:28:53.830 --> 02:28:57.670
<v Speaker 6>I've been going to gun shows since I was</v>
<v Speaker 6>a kid because my dad would go there and </v>

3586
02:28:57.670 --> 02:29:00.430
<v Speaker 6>my uncle and you know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then even especially when I worked </v>

3587
02:29:00.430 --> 02:29:00.590
<v Speaker 6>for the gun shop,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would go there and help out at shows.</v>

3588
02:29:00.591 --> 02:29:03.410
<v Speaker 6>Maybe if we had a table,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a different stuff.</v>

3589
02:29:04.370 --> 02:29:07.160
<v Speaker 6>You go to a gun show and even as a </v>
<v Speaker 6>concealed weapons license holder,</v>

3590
02:29:07.161 --> 02:29:09.050
<v Speaker 6>I mean anybody that comes to the gun </v>
<v Speaker 6>show,</v>

3591
02:29:09.051 --> 02:29:10.020
<v Speaker 6>you pay your admission,</v>
<v Speaker 6>boom,</v>

3592
02:29:10.021 --> 02:29:15.021
<v Speaker 6>you can come in if you want to purchase </v>
<v Speaker 6>a firearm and this goes for the </v>

3593
02:29:15.021 --> 02:29:18.311
<v Speaker 6>Washington arms collector association </v>
<v Speaker 6>who runs all their gun shows and </v>

3594
02:29:18.311 --> 02:29:20.771
<v Speaker 6>Washington.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You have to go and do another line and </v>

3595
02:29:20.771 --> 02:29:23.921
<v Speaker 6>fill out and have all your paperwork,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whereas you have the same in every </v>

3596
02:29:23.921 --> 02:29:26.831
<v Speaker 6>state.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not sure now I cannot speak for </v>

3597
02:29:26.831 --> 02:29:29.021
<v Speaker 6>every state,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I know that me growing up as a </v>

3598
02:29:29.021 --> 02:29:31.200
<v Speaker 6>working and being a part of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>Washington arms collector association </v>

3599
02:29:31.200 --> 02:29:31.200
<v Speaker 6>and all that and going to their gun </v>
<v Speaker 6>shows,</v>

3600
02:29:31.290 --> 02:29:33.980
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you have to go get nicks checked.</v>

3601
02:29:34.630 --> 02:29:35.950
<v Speaker 2>Well that's all well and good man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

3602
02:29:35.951 --> 02:29:38.020
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how do you stop letting this kid who</v>

3603
02:29:38.200 --> 02:29:39.430
<v Speaker 2>did this in Connecticut?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3604
02:29:39.431 --> 02:29:41.470
<v Speaker 2>he violated a bunch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He approached.</v>

3605
02:29:41.730 --> 02:29:44.320
<v Speaker 2>He already started leaving the house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He started off off</v>

3606
02:29:44.420 --> 02:29:46.030
<v Speaker 6>by murdering his mom.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3607
02:29:46.290 --> 02:29:47.700
<v Speaker 6>that's already,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's not good.</v>

3608
02:29:47.850 --> 02:29:48.600
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's not good.</v>

3609
02:29:48.601 --> 02:29:51.690
<v Speaker 6>And why does a guy murder their,</v>
<v Speaker 6>their parents in the first place?</v>

3610
02:29:51.691 --> 02:29:53.850
<v Speaker 6>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And the thing is,</v>

3611
02:29:53.851 --> 02:29:55.530
<v Speaker 6>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3612
02:29:55.531 --> 02:30:00.531
<v Speaker 6>he,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he went and he chose to use the tool of </v>

3613
02:30:00.531 --> 02:30:02.910
<v Speaker 6>firearms to go off and do whatever that </v>
<v Speaker 6>is that he decided to.</v>

3614
02:30:02.911 --> 02:30:06.030
<v Speaker 6>And I still can't figure out why the </v>
<v Speaker 6>fuck in the first place.</v>

3615
02:30:06.390 --> 02:30:09.360
<v Speaker 6>Did he go to a school and shoot children</v>
<v Speaker 6>of all things,</v>

3616
02:30:09.390 --> 02:30:11.940
<v Speaker 6>like I don't understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that rationale.</v>

3617
02:30:11.941 --> 02:30:14.550
<v Speaker 6>Like what did it accomplish?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What was the statement?</v>

3618
02:30:14.551 --> 02:30:16.350
<v Speaker 6>What was he trying to prove?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

3619
02:30:16.351 --> 02:30:21.351
<v Speaker 6>There's not to mention there's even </v>
<v Speaker 6>stuff floating about on the Internet </v>

3620
02:30:21.351 --> 02:30:23.360
<v Speaker 6>where the dads have not only this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3621
02:30:23.710 --> 02:30:28.710
<v Speaker 6>the sandy hook killer and the killer </v>
<v Speaker 6>from the Batman movie a shooting both </v>

3622
02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:35.000
<v Speaker 6>somehow have something to do with a </v>
<v Speaker 6>banking and financial stuff that has </v>

3623
02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:36.000
<v Speaker 6>actually been disproven.</v>

3624
02:30:36.060 --> 02:30:36.450
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

3625
02:30:36.451 --> 02:30:39.540
<v Speaker 6>they're not actually going to go to the </v>
<v Speaker 6>library a scandal as,</v>

3626
02:30:39.580 --> 02:30:42.660
<v Speaker 6>as they're trying to say that they're </v>
<v Speaker 6>both going to be at the library hearing,</v>

3627
02:30:42.661 --> 02:30:47.661
<v Speaker 6>but they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But yet the Batman shooters dad is </v>

3628
02:30:47.661 --> 02:30:49.170
<v Speaker 6>apparently some,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a statistical analysis,</v>

3629
02:30:49.200 --> 02:30:54.200
<v Speaker 6>whatever kind of guy that what he does,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he creates these algorithms that are </v>

3630
02:30:54.200 --> 02:30:55.230
<v Speaker 6>used in banking.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Did the decipher all this shit.</v>

3631
02:30:55.231 --> 02:30:56.880
<v Speaker 6>And figure all this shit out and what it</v>
<v Speaker 6>is,</v>

3632
02:30:57.120 --> 02:30:59.310
<v Speaker 6>is that the shit that he creates,</v>
<v Speaker 6>these algorithms,</v>

3633
02:30:59.320 --> 02:31:04.320
<v Speaker 6>these mathematical things are the same </v>
<v Speaker 6>things that you use to figure out that </v>

3634
02:31:04.320 --> 02:31:06.890
<v Speaker 6>libraries as being is that the library </v>
<v Speaker 6>scandals,</v>

3635
02:31:06.900 --> 02:31:11.900
<v Speaker 6>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all the line that's been done in the </v>

3636
02:31:11.900 --> 02:31:13.500
<v Speaker 6>rates being so he's involved or maybe </v>
<v Speaker 6>even just on a cursory way in terms of </v>

3637
02:31:13.500 --> 02:31:16.680
<v Speaker 6>figuring out the people that are </v>
<v Speaker 6>cheating you with the banks and then the</v>

3638
02:31:16.681 --> 02:31:19.020
<v Speaker 6>other guy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the dad of the sandy hook killer,</v>

3639
02:31:19.180 --> 02:31:24.180
<v Speaker 6>he's apparently it works at some </v>
<v Speaker 6>financial institution of some sort and </v>

3640
02:31:24.180 --> 02:31:27.541
<v Speaker 6>his division has three people underneath</v>
<v Speaker 6>them that are being indicted for having </v>

3641
02:31:27.580 --> 02:31:32.580
<v Speaker 6>being a part of this live worship and </v>
<v Speaker 6>using the falsified a ratings to to</v>

3642
02:31:36.530 --> 02:31:38.270
<v Speaker 2>how many people are involved in the or </v>
<v Speaker 2>scandal.</v>

3643
02:31:38.271 --> 02:31:38.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean it isn't impossible.</v>

3644
02:31:39.010 --> 02:31:41.020
<v Speaker 6>It was just coincidence.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It could be and I'm not,</v>

3645
02:31:41.021 --> 02:31:46.021
<v Speaker 6>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not sitting there saying that this </v>

3646
02:31:46.021 --> 02:31:47.671
<v Speaker 6>all is necessarily related and I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure that there is fucked up </v>

3647
02:31:47.671 --> 02:31:51.181
<v Speaker 6>parenting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That you've got kids that are being </v>

3648
02:31:51.181 --> 02:31:53.971
<v Speaker 6>medicated to death and who knows what </v>
<v Speaker 6>he's taking because apparently he was </v>

3649
02:31:53.971 --> 02:31:57.301
<v Speaker 6>mentally ill and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and there are drugs out there that they </v>

3650
02:31:57.301 --> 02:32:00.331
<v Speaker 6>will give our kids and they will give </v>
<v Speaker 6>people and have them walk the streets </v>

3651
02:32:00.331 --> 02:32:01.180
<v Speaker 6>that some of the side effects are </v>
<v Speaker 6>suicidal thoughts,</v>

3652
02:32:01.181 --> 02:32:03.640
<v Speaker 6>homicidal act.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's just ridiculous.</v>

3653
02:32:03.690 --> 02:32:08.690
<v Speaker 6>You're jamming all this medication down,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a human being and you expect them to </v>

3654
02:32:08.690 --> 02:32:09.730
<v Speaker 6>function within our society like anybody</v>
<v Speaker 6>else.</v>

3655
02:32:09.880 --> 02:32:10.870
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the real issue,</v>

3656
02:32:10.871 --> 02:32:12.730
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the actual numbers,</v>

3657
02:32:12.760 --> 02:32:17.760
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a citizens' commission on human rights </v>

3658
02:32:17.760 --> 02:32:19.861
<v Speaker 2>of CCHR has said that out of the last 14</v>
<v Speaker 2>recent school shootings,</v>

3659
02:32:20.380 --> 02:32:25.380
<v Speaker 2>all of them were committed by those </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking or withdrawing from psychiatric </v>

3660
02:32:25.380 --> 02:32:28.120
<v Speaker 2>drugs resulting in 109 wounded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>58 killed.</v>

3661
02:32:28.140 --> 02:32:33.140
<v Speaker 2>It was also at least 22 international </v>
<v Speaker 2>drug regulatory warnings that have been </v>

3662
02:32:33.140 --> 02:32:37.650
<v Speaker 2>issued on psychiatric drugs causing side</v>
<v Speaker 2>effects of mania,</v>

3663
02:32:37.810 --> 02:32:38.920
<v Speaker 2>psychosis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aggression,</v>

3664
02:32:38.921 --> 02:32:39.910
<v Speaker 2>hostility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>violence,</v>

3665
02:32:40.020 --> 02:32:41.250
<v Speaker 2>and even homicidal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3666
02:32:41.740 --> 02:32:45.610
<v Speaker 2>I think a big part of it is that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>not everybody you know.</v>

3667
02:32:45.611 --> 02:32:47.800
<v Speaker 2>And that's important for a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are on that shit,</v>

3668
02:32:48.010 --> 02:32:50.020
<v Speaker 2>that it does them good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It helps them.</v>

3669
02:32:50.410 --> 02:32:52.780
<v Speaker 2>But there's a lot of people that can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>drink also,</v>

3670
02:32:52.850 --> 02:32:57.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people they drink and </v>

3671
02:32:57.850 --> 02:32:57.850
<v Speaker 2>they're gone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3672
02:32:57.850 --> 02:32:57.850
<v Speaker 2>so you see the switch go off and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>become an alcoholic.</v>

3673
02:32:58.250 --> 02:33:01.240
<v Speaker 2>The everybody's got a different setup.</v>

3674
02:33:01.420 --> 02:33:03.700
<v Speaker 2>And for some people these things are not</v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

3675
02:33:04.240 --> 02:33:05.850
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

3676
02:33:05.880 --> 02:33:08.790
<v Speaker 2>when you're talking about those numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could.</v>

3677
02:33:09.190 --> 02:33:11.410
<v Speaker 2>I've seen people argue and it's really </v>
<v Speaker 2>fascinating,</v>

3678
02:33:11.740 --> 02:33:16.090
<v Speaker 2>the people that are like really opposed </v>
<v Speaker 2>to anything that might be fuckery.</v>

3679
02:33:16.350 --> 02:33:17.530
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people like,</v>

3680
02:33:17.560 --> 02:33:18.130
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this,</v>

3681
02:33:18.190 --> 02:33:23.190
<v Speaker 2>there's no cars which are just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're talking about people are </v>

3682
02:33:23.190 --> 02:33:23.500
<v Speaker 2>fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course people are fucked up on drugs.</v>

3683
02:33:23.550 --> 02:33:28.550
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean the drugs are causing </v>
<v Speaker 2>them and you don't know that that's a </v>

3684
02:33:28.550 --> 02:33:32.431
<v Speaker 2>really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's a weird thing where chemical </v>

3685
02:33:32.431 --> 02:33:32.431
<v Speaker 2>composition of your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's this,</v>

3686
02:33:32.431 --> 02:33:37.130
<v Speaker 2>this sort of pro science stance that a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of people want to take that are </v>

3687
02:33:37.360 --> 02:33:42.360
<v Speaker 2>people that think that there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people wearing tinfoil hats and looking </v>

3688
02:33:42.360 --> 02:33:43.690
<v Speaker 2>for conspiracies and looking for </v>
<v Speaker 2>nonsense and everything.</v>

3689
02:33:43.990 --> 02:33:48.990
<v Speaker 2>But man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like the same type of people </v>

3690
02:33:48.990 --> 02:33:49.840
<v Speaker 2>that want to downplay the possibility </v>
<v Speaker 2>that any sort of,</v>

3691
02:33:49.870 --> 02:33:54.870
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vaccinations have been damaging to </v>

3692
02:33:54.870 --> 02:33:54.870
<v Speaker 2>children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3693
02:33:54.870 --> 02:33:58.320
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's another weird one that people </v>

3694
02:33:58.320 --> 02:33:58.320
<v Speaker 2>don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was weird and address I</v>

3695
02:33:58.320 --> 02:34:00.930
<v Speaker 6>think the strongest argument for all of </v>
<v Speaker 6>that as even potential.</v>

3696
02:34:01.110 --> 02:34:06.110
<v Speaker 6>And I'm not talking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wear tinfoil hats or anything like </v>

3697
02:34:06.110 --> 02:34:06.110
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but something I stated,</v>

3698
02:34:06.110 --> 02:34:09.300
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I touched on earlier throughout mankind,</v>

3699
02:34:09.301 --> 02:34:13.600
<v Speaker 6>we fucking lie.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We lie and we cheat our,</v>

3700
02:34:13.670 --> 02:34:16.590
<v Speaker 6>our populous constantly over and over </v>
<v Speaker 6>and over.</v>

3701
02:34:16.591 --> 02:34:19.060
<v Speaker 6>We do it religion,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we do it with our politics.</v>

3702
02:34:19.240 --> 02:34:20.560
<v Speaker 6>They constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3703
02:34:20.561 --> 02:34:25.561
<v Speaker 6>you have companies that go and they </v>
<v Speaker 6>deliberately destroy the environment </v>

3704
02:34:26.081 --> 02:34:29.110
<v Speaker 6>with their chemicals and their shit and </v>
<v Speaker 6>they know they're doing it and they know</v>

3705
02:34:29.111 --> 02:34:34.111
<v Speaker 6>that it's destroying shit and they just </v>
<v Speaker 6>know that they can get away with it and </v>

3706
02:34:34.111 --> 02:34:34.150
<v Speaker 6>they just lie.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then all of a sudden boom there have</v>

3707
02:34:34.420 --> 02:34:37.630
<v Speaker 6>somebody comes out of the woodwork and </v>
<v Speaker 6>make them accountable for it.</v>

3708
02:34:37.631 --> 02:34:40.030
<v Speaker 6>And then they backtrack and they tell a </v>
<v Speaker 6>whole bunch more lies.</v>

3709
02:34:40.270 --> 02:34:45.270
<v Speaker 6>They feed them a couple of goats and </v>
<v Speaker 6>then they keep on doing the same </v>

3710
02:34:45.270 --> 02:34:45.270
<v Speaker 6>bullshit and they never have to pay the </v>
<v Speaker 6>price for.</v>

3711
02:34:45.270 --> 02:34:50.250
<v Speaker 6>We have all these politicians that go </v>
<v Speaker 6>out there and when they try to feed us </v>

3712
02:34:50.250 --> 02:34:51.430
<v Speaker 6>all these lines about how they're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3713
02:34:51.490 --> 02:34:53.650
<v Speaker 6>they're this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're part of that side and this other</v>

3714
02:34:53.651 --> 02:34:58.651
<v Speaker 6>side is wrong and vice versa and split </v>
<v Speaker 6>us as a populous and then they go and </v>

3715
02:34:58.651 --> 02:34:58.651
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

3716
02:34:58.651 --> 02:35:00.190

<v Speaker 6>30 million.</v>

3736
02:35:35.470 --> 02:35:40.470
<v Speaker 6>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not 30 million people out there </v>

3737
02:35:40.470 --> 02:35:40.470
<v Speaker 6>walking the street,</v>

3738
02:35:40.470 --> 02:35:42.670
<v Speaker 6>Xanax to whatever up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I remember,</v>

3739
02:35:42.671 --> 02:35:47.671
<v Speaker 6>I remember going through a really </v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking bad breakup not that long ago </v>

3740
02:35:47.671 --> 02:35:49.780
<v Speaker 6>and just fucking dying and having </v>
<v Speaker 6>anxiety for the first time.</v>

3741
02:35:49.781 --> 02:35:54.781
<v Speaker 6>I've never had that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've got a lot of shit go down in my </v>

3742
02:35:54.781 --> 02:35:57.481
<v Speaker 6>life,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I've never had this fucked up </v>

3743
02:35:57.481 --> 02:35:58.891
<v Speaker 6>anxiety and all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not sleeping and I'm having a hard </v>

3744
02:35:58.891 --> 02:36:01.000
<v Speaker 6>time getting full deep breaths.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All this shit.</v>

3745
02:36:01.110 --> 02:36:02.920
<v Speaker 6>Trash Strip clubs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

3746
02:36:03.070 --> 02:36:04.660
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I definitely did strip clubs.</v>

3747
02:36:04.661 --> 02:36:08.530
<v Speaker 6>I hope it helps some but a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's like a little bridge.</v>

3748
02:36:08.531 --> 02:36:09.640
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Bridge to happiness.</v>

3749
02:36:09.641 --> 02:36:11.120
<v Speaker 6>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the thing was,</v>

3750
02:36:11.121 --> 02:36:14.440
<v Speaker 6>is that I knew that I could probably hit</v>
<v Speaker 6>up somebody and get a pill,</v>

3751
02:36:14.740 --> 02:36:15.850
<v Speaker 6>take all that shit away.</v>

3752
02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:19.540
<v Speaker 6>And to me I thought that's a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>coward's way out.</v>

3753
02:36:19.960 --> 02:36:23.800
<v Speaker 6>That's not the way you do it because </v>
<v Speaker 6>going through this shit means something.</v>

3754
02:36:24.040 --> 02:36:27.460
<v Speaker 6>It's something that I need to do to be a</v>
<v Speaker 6>stronger,</v>

3755
02:36:27.490 --> 02:36:30.010
<v Speaker 6>better,</v>
<v Speaker 6>more well adjusted man.</v>

3756
02:36:30.011 --> 02:36:35.011
<v Speaker 6>Like I need to go through this and deal </v>
<v Speaker 6>with it because dealing with it is how </v>

3757
02:36:35.011 --> 02:36:35.830
<v Speaker 6>you make yourself better in the future </v>
<v Speaker 6>so you know,</v>

3758
02:36:35.831 --> 02:36:40.831
<v Speaker 6>you go through a cold instead of getting</v>
<v Speaker 6>the vaccine flu instead of getting </v>

3759
02:36:40.831 --> 02:36:43.561
<v Speaker 6>vaccinated,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so now your body knows how to adapt to </v>

3760
02:36:43.561 --> 02:36:45.901
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so you go through depression and </v>

3761
02:36:45.901 --> 02:36:45.901
<v Speaker 6>figuring out how to solve it and not get</v>
<v Speaker 6>depressed again.</v>

3762
02:36:45.901 --> 02:36:47.440
<v Speaker 6>And I'm not saying that there aren't </v>
<v Speaker 6>people out there that,</v>

3763
02:36:47.470 --> 02:36:52.470
<v Speaker 6>that WHO's chemical balances for </v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever reason have gotten all twisted </v>

3764
02:36:52.470 --> 02:36:56.851
<v Speaker 6>up and they really do need help.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the real issue is when I knew </v>

3765
02:36:56.851 --> 02:36:59.611
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but for me I could tell that wasn't the </v>

3766
02:36:59.611 --> 02:36:59.611
<v Speaker 6>case.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3767
02:36:59.611 --> 02:36:59.611
<v Speaker 6>I was just fucking heartbroken.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

3768
02:36:59.611 --> 02:37:00.880
<v Speaker 6>That,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's what it was and it was.</v>

3769
02:37:00.910 --> 02:37:05.910
<v Speaker 6>It was not really few fine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Poor Josh Barnett on the inside.</v>

3770
02:37:06.700 --> 02:37:09.670
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is never going to find her again,</v>

3771
02:37:09.671 --> 02:37:10.630
<v Speaker 6>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3772
02:37:11.820 --> 02:37:13.960
<v Speaker 6>The idea is that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3773
02:37:13.961 --> 02:37:15.960
<v Speaker 6>it's not either or.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think the</v>

3774
02:37:16.060 --> 02:37:17.900
<v Speaker 3>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3775
02:37:17.901 --> 02:37:22.901
<v Speaker 3>he's cute and very funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think you'd ever be </v>

3776
02:37:22.901 --> 02:37:25.241
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just can't get over the fact that he </v>

3777
02:37:25.241 --> 02:37:25.241
<v Speaker 3>likes guns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's creepy and a little scary.</v>

3778
02:37:25.241 --> 02:37:26.660
<v Speaker 3>Somebody as smart as him shouldn't need </v>
<v Speaker 3>a gun to feel like a man,</v>

3779
02:37:27.020 --> 02:37:30.650
<v Speaker 3>be a man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lose the gun to shoot loads in her.</v>

3780
02:37:30.830 --> 02:37:32.190
<v Speaker 3>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a blast.</v>

3781
02:37:32.330 --> 02:37:37.330
<v Speaker 3>Hide my guns in a hole in the backyard </v>
<v Speaker 3>and pretend kind of propaganda is fucked</v>

3782
02:37:38.121 --> 02:37:38.620
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

3783
02:37:38.880 --> 02:37:39.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

3784
02:37:39.771 --> 02:37:44.771
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I own quite a few firearms and most of </v>

3785
02:37:44.771 --> 02:37:45.250
<v Speaker 3>it for the collection of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I'm a nerd,</v>

3786
02:37:45.310 --> 02:37:50.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's the people that inhabit all </v>

3787
02:37:50.310 --> 02:37:50.310
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3789

<v Speaker 3>social awkward.</v>

3790
02:37:54.350 --> 02:37:56.060
<v Speaker 3>They're just nerds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nerds,</v>

3791
02:37:56.061 --> 02:37:56.570
<v Speaker 3>nerds,</v>

<v Speaker 3>weapons that everyone wants to go on </v>

<v Speaker 3>about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All these crazy solves all these crazy </v>

3794
02:38:04.601 --> 02:38:04.601
<v Speaker 3>capabilities.</v>

3795
02:38:04.601 --> 02:38:04.601
<v Speaker 3>Gun nerds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nerds.</v>

3796

<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's who buys these fucking thinks is.</v>

3797
02:38:05.011 --> 02:38:07.490
<v Speaker 3>Those are the only people that can </v>
<v Speaker 3>afford them or have the interest to have</v>

3798
02:38:07.491 --> 02:38:07.970
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3799
02:38:07.971 --> 02:38:09.680
<v Speaker 3>that's not true because there's always </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>

3800
02:38:09.750 --> 02:38:12.920
<v Speaker 3>It's such a huge amount of crazy people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that share them.</v>

3801
02:38:13.010 --> 02:38:18.010
<v Speaker 3>There is a small amount.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's when people really don't </v>

3802
02:38:18.010 --> 02:38:18.010
<v Speaker 3>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When it comes to the numbers of guns,</v>

3803
02:38:18.010 --> 02:38:22.420
<v Speaker 3>it's like there's like Pierce Morgan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought he was going on this crazy </v>

3804
02:38:22.420 --> 02:38:22.420
<v Speaker 3>rant about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3805
02:38:22.420 --> 02:38:27.091
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>America has this love affair with guns </v>

3806
02:38:27.091 --> 02:38:27.091
<v Speaker 3>and look where it's got us and look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>

3807
02:38:27.091 --> 02:38:27.260
<v Speaker 3>It's so dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guns is doing it well.</v>

3808
02:38:27.350 --> 02:38:28.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The people,</v>

3809
02:38:28.760 --> 02:38:33.760
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to think about how many people </v>

3810
02:38:33.760 --> 02:38:33.760
<v Speaker 3>are not doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3811
02:38:33.760 --> 02:38:35.630
<v Speaker 3>Because there's so many armed </v>
<v Speaker 3>motherfuckers in this country.</v>

3812
02:38:35.631 --> 02:38:40.631
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing gun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't walk around pulling guns on </v>

3813
02:38:40.631 --> 02:38:44.171
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you get on the highway and you see </v>

3814
02:38:44.171 --> 02:38:46.370
<v Speaker 3>a like a traffic accident,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing how few you find they are </v>

3815
02:38:46.370 --> 02:38:48.290
<v Speaker 3>God damn millions of cars flying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>going 60,</v>

3816
02:38:48.291 --> 02:38:53.291
<v Speaker 3>70 miles an hour all around each other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the time in each other and they </v>

3817
02:38:53.291 --> 02:38:53.291
<v Speaker 3>aren't hitting each other.</v>

3818
02:38:53.291 --> 02:38:53.291
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

3819
02:38:53.291 --> 02:38:56.540
<v Speaker 3>What we have to realize is that when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're dealing with a society,</v>

3820
02:38:56.570 --> 02:38:59.480
<v Speaker 3>a complex society like what we have now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>complex,</v>

3821
02:38:59.650 --> 02:39:04.650
<v Speaker 3>credible numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the number of people is absolutely </v>

3822
02:39:04.650 --> 02:39:04.650
<v Speaker 3>staggering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

3823
02:39:04.650 --> 02:39:08.321
<v Speaker 3>I read something recently,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like America itself is like the only </v>

3824
02:39:08.321 --> 02:39:12.371
<v Speaker 3>example of so many cultures and races </v>
<v Speaker 3>and mixing all the way that it does.</v>

3825
02:39:13.090 --> 02:39:15.470
<v Speaker 3>Like you go to Europe and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the most part,</v>

3826
02:39:15.530 --> 02:39:17.930
<v Speaker 3>almost all countries are pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 3>homogeneous,</v>

3827
02:39:18.200 --> 02:39:23.200
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>With a few exceptions of experts and </v>

3828
02:39:23.200 --> 02:39:23.270
<v Speaker 3>people from other general,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like in America we said,</v>

3829
02:39:23.300 --> 02:39:24.050
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3830
02:39:24.590 --> 02:39:27.560
<v Speaker 3>everybody of any kind at any religion of</v>
<v Speaker 3>any faith,</v>

3831
02:39:27.561 --> 02:39:28.850
<v Speaker 3>of any creative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any color,</v>

3832
02:39:29.210 --> 02:39:32.360
<v Speaker 3>bring them all together and to take all </v>
<v Speaker 3>these different cultures,</v>

3833
02:39:32.520 --> 02:39:34.320
<v Speaker 3>some quite different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3834
02:39:34.340 --> 02:39:39.340
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say from a root culture to know </v>

3835
02:39:39.340 --> 02:39:40.340
<v Speaker 3>before becoming an American,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say early stages of American,</v>

3836
02:39:40.341 --> 02:39:45.341
<v Speaker 3>how even vast Irish could be from </v>
<v Speaker 3>Italian and how they're brought up and </v>

3837
02:39:45.341 --> 02:39:46.280
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their upbringings.</v>

3838
02:39:46.280 --> 02:39:48.440
<v Speaker 3>I mean fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's so many different and yet</v>

3839
02:39:48.470 --> 02:39:51.680
<v Speaker 3>we managed to put together this country </v>
<v Speaker 3>that has survived,</v>

3840
02:39:52.070 --> 02:39:57.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>however many hundred so years as it has </v>

3841
02:39:57.070 --> 02:39:57.440
<v Speaker 3>and has done some pretty amazing things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3842
02:39:57.770 --> 02:39:59.810
<v Speaker 3>Without us trying to all murder each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other all the time.</v>

3843
02:39:59.840 --> 02:40:02.660
<v Speaker 3>I think there's some issues that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely have to be addressed.</v>

3844
02:40:02.661 --> 02:40:04.700
<v Speaker 3>One of them is this antidepressant </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>

3845
02:40:04.701 --> 02:40:09.701
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not saying that people should </v>
<v Speaker 3>not be on it because I know people that </v>

3846
02:40:09.701 --> 02:40:10.280
<v Speaker 3>have been on it and it's helped them and</v>
<v Speaker 3>changed their life and saved their life.</v>

3847
02:40:10.281 --> 02:40:15.281
<v Speaker 3>He sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but maybe you shouldn't have a fucking </v>

3848
02:40:15.281 --> 02:40:15.281
<v Speaker 3>gun when you're on it because it seems </v>
<v Speaker 3>like</v>

3849
02:40:15.281 --> 02:40:16.600
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people that are on these things</v>
<v Speaker 2>and take guns.</v>

3850
02:40:16.630 --> 02:40:18.490
<v Speaker 2>That's where my problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's not okay</v>

3851
02:40:18.520 --> 02:40:23.520
<v Speaker 6>listed as one of the things about next,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but probably because of a pharmaceutical</v>

3852
02:40:23.891 --> 02:40:25.330
<v Speaker 6>industry that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and the,</v>

3853
02:40:25.331 --> 02:40:30.331
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>under the guise of the whole patient </v>

3854
02:40:30.331 --> 02:40:30.331
<v Speaker 6>confidentiality.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now they say in the,</v>

3855
02:40:30.331 --> 02:40:31.180
<v Speaker 6>in the statutes that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3856
02:40:31.210 --> 02:40:32.020
<v Speaker 6>they can,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they can,</v>

3857
02:40:32.080 --> 02:40:37.080
<v Speaker 6>your,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you cannot have a gun if you're a under </v>

3858
02:40:37.080 --> 02:40:37.080
<v Speaker 6>indictment,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3859
02:40:37.080 --> 02:40:39.400
<v Speaker 6>for crime punishable by imprisonment,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a exceeding one year.</v>

3860
02:40:39.401 --> 02:40:40.570
<v Speaker 6>All these different things,</v>
<v Speaker 6>illegal,</v>

3861
02:40:40.571 --> 02:40:41.480
<v Speaker 6>alien,</v>
<v Speaker 6>agitated.</v>

3862
02:40:41.770 --> 02:40:45.630
<v Speaker 6>Now here's the one that's even similar </v>
<v Speaker 6>to being on antidepressants and all this</v>

3863
02:40:45.640 --> 02:40:50.640
<v Speaker 6>is who has been educated as a mental,</v>
<v Speaker 6>defective or has been committed to any </v>

3864
02:40:50.640 --> 02:40:50.640
<v Speaker 6>mental institution.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay?</v>

3865
02:40:50.640 --> 02:40:52.990
<v Speaker 6>That's where they commit you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

3866
02:40:52.991 --> 02:40:54.400
<v Speaker 6>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3867
02:40:54.460 --> 02:40:56.680
<v Speaker 6>by the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>under the probably the laws of,</v>

3868
02:40:56.681 --> 02:40:58.660
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>of medical confidence,</v>

3869
02:40:59.080 --> 02:41:00.130
<v Speaker 6>therefore it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

3870
02:41:00.131 --> 02:41:01.480
<v Speaker 6>we can't just tell people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

3871
02:41:01.481 --> 02:41:04.330
<v Speaker 6>this guy is all jacked up on like four </v>
<v Speaker 6>different antidepressants.</v>

3872
02:41:04.690 --> 02:41:05.500
<v Speaker 6>We can't just say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

3873
02:41:05.501 --> 02:41:07.420
<v Speaker 6>well you can't have a firearm based on </v>
<v Speaker 6>that alone.</v>

3874
02:41:07.450 --> 02:41:09.130
<v Speaker 6>Where I think,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

3875
02:41:09.131 --> 02:41:10.850
<v Speaker 6>actually we probably should.</v>
<v Speaker 6>In fact,</v>

3876
02:41:10.870 --> 02:41:13.730
<v Speaker 6>if it was really to be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my,</v>

3877
02:41:13.780 --> 02:41:17.390
<v Speaker 6>my whole thing is I wish that there was </v>
<v Speaker 6>a way we had a,</v>

3878
02:41:17.440 --> 02:41:19.840
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a licensing system to get your firearm.</v>

3879
02:41:19.841 --> 02:41:22.420
<v Speaker 6>Just like you have to get a car.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like you have to prove your,</v>

3880
02:41:22.540 --> 02:41:24.850
<v Speaker 6>you have to take competency tests,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you have to prove competency,</v>

3881
02:41:24.851 --> 02:41:29.050
<v Speaker 6>you have to improve understanding of the</v>
<v Speaker 6>mechanics of the firearm itself,</v>

3882
02:41:29.051 --> 02:41:31.390
<v Speaker 6>how it operates,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how to take it apart,</v>

3883
02:41:31.530 --> 02:41:34.210
<v Speaker 6>how to understand taking care of it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how to operate it.</v>

3884
02:41:34.360 --> 02:41:36.640
<v Speaker 6>I agree on this thing safely.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then then,</v>

3885
02:41:36.850 --> 02:41:38.770
<v Speaker 6>then once you've passed such a certain,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3886
02:41:38.771 --> 02:41:39.920
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3887
02:41:39.940 --> 02:41:44.940
<v Speaker 6>amount of testing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then you can be given a card and then </v>

3888
02:41:44.940 --> 02:41:44.940
<v Speaker 6>you meet,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3889
02:41:44.940 --> 02:41:47.330
<v Speaker 6>can go out there and buy a farm.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I really think that apps people are not,</v>

3890
02:41:47.500 --> 02:41:52.500
<v Speaker 6>but I also believe that that we as a </v>
<v Speaker 6>populace are so irresponsible,</v>

3891
02:41:53.411 --> 02:41:57.010
<v Speaker 6>even more so with our motor vehicles </v>
<v Speaker 6>that is not even funny,</v>

3892
02:41:57.040 --> 02:42:00.430
<v Speaker 6>that the how easy it is to get behind </v>
<v Speaker 6>the wheel of a 4,000</v>

3893
02:42:00.431 --> 02:42:05.431
<v Speaker 6>pound car and go out there and kill each</v>
<v Speaker 6>other is ridiculous and it's way too </v>

3894
02:42:05.431 --> 02:42:08.830
<v Speaker 6>easily available to anyone and people </v>
<v Speaker 6>love just creating the hot button topics</v>

3895
02:42:08.831 --> 02:42:10.570
<v Speaker 6>and it's easy to get people fired up </v>
<v Speaker 6>about something.</v>

3896
02:42:10.570 --> 02:42:11.800
<v Speaker 6>Has guns.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't need those,</v>

3897
02:42:11.890 --> 02:42:13.600
<v Speaker 6>but we need cars.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Great.</v>

3898
02:42:13.680 --> 02:42:14.730
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen people say,</v>

3899
02:42:14.731 --> 02:42:16.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you could get another,</v>

3900
02:42:16.680 --> 02:42:17.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go,</v>

3901
02:42:17.561 --> 02:42:19.770
<v Speaker 2>you got to go hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get another fucking hobby.</v>

3902
02:42:20.280 --> 02:42:21.570
<v Speaker 2>I've actually seen people write that </v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

3903
02:42:21.960 --> 02:42:23.340
<v Speaker 2>That's the answer I've seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People say,</v>

3904
02:42:23.341 --> 02:42:28.341
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish that the animals were armed to </v>

3905
02:42:28.341 --> 02:42:30.380
<v Speaker 2>what you were saying all about licensing</v>
<v Speaker 2>and everything that all that's all well </v>

3906
02:42:30.380 --> 02:42:30.380
<v Speaker 2>and good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but here's the problem.</v>

3907
02:42:30.380 --> 02:42:32.240
<v Speaker 2>That kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was not as fucking gun.</v>

3908
02:42:32.270 --> 02:42:34.290
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he went and legal.</v>

3909
02:42:34.500 --> 02:42:39.500
<v Speaker 2>It's illegal use of the guns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is also the case with the kids in </v>

3910
02:42:39.500 --> 02:42:39.780
<v Speaker 2>Columbine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Illegal.</v>

3911
02:42:40.410 --> 02:42:41.770
<v Speaker 2>They murdered somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>installed them,</v>

3912
02:42:41.880 --> 02:42:44.400
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're always gonna have that problem</v>

3913
02:42:44.430 --> 02:42:46.470
<v Speaker 2>if those guns exist and also potentially</v>

3914
02:42:46.810 --> 02:42:49.800
<v Speaker 6>let's say that mother had gone through </v>
<v Speaker 6>all that training and,</v>

3915
02:42:49.930 --> 02:42:50.300
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

3916
02:42:50.340 --> 02:42:52.660
<v Speaker 6>and in doing so locked her guns up.</v>

3917
02:42:52.690 --> 02:42:53.550
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3918
02:42:54.020 --> 02:42:56.830
<v Speaker 2>you now you're going really far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You trying to make someone a responsible</v>

3919
02:42:56.831 --> 02:42:58.810
<v Speaker 2>parent almost fucking of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

3920
02:42:59.280 --> 02:43:04.280
<v Speaker 6>is that when,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when people are forced to do something </v>

3921
02:43:04.280 --> 02:43:04.280
<v Speaker 6>through responsible means to actually </v>
<v Speaker 6>acquire the,</v>

3922
02:43:04.280 --> 02:43:07.990
<v Speaker 6>improve themselves capable of owning the</v>
<v Speaker 6>opportunity to be responsible like that.</v>

3923
02:43:07.991 --> 02:43:09.190
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and trust me,</v>

3924
02:43:09.191 --> 02:43:12.050
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>me talking about having government which</v>

3925
02:43:12.051 --> 02:43:17.051
<v Speaker 6>I already think is incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 6>irresponsible and does things for its </v>

3926
02:43:17.051 --> 02:43:17.051
<v Speaker 6>own reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 6>create more,</v>

3927
02:43:17.051 --> 02:43:17.300
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>licensing,</v>

3928
02:43:17.330 --> 02:43:19.310
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean there's always a concern like,</v>

3929
02:43:19.311 --> 02:43:24.311
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well then they just decided that nobody </v>

3930
02:43:24.311 --> 02:43:24.311
<v Speaker 6>can ever pass and therefore no one can </v>
<v Speaker 6>ever have a gun regulatory</v>

3931
02:43:24.311 --> 02:43:27.110
<v Speaker 2>bodies that do their job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm out of passion first.</v>

3932
02:43:27.200 --> 02:43:32.200
<v Speaker 2>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fish and game fish and game does a </v>

3933
02:43:32.200 --> 02:43:34.151
<v Speaker 2>pretty fucking good job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he spent the money is all from </v>

3934
02:43:34.151 --> 02:43:38.111
<v Speaker 2>hunting tags and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that that's what pays for </v>

3935
02:43:38.111 --> 02:43:40.631
<v Speaker 2>conservation efforts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people don't understand that </v>

3936
02:43:40.631 --> 02:43:42.831
<v Speaker 2>that fishing game does a very good job </v>
<v Speaker 2>of managing the wildlife in this </v>

3937
02:43:42.831 --> 02:43:42.831
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People,</v>

3938
02:43:42.840 --> 02:43:43.900
<v Speaker 2>one of the most efficient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3939
02:43:44.690 --> 02:43:49.690
<v Speaker 6>How the hunting tags or even re relegate</v>
<v Speaker 6>it out there to the populace is because </v>

3940
02:43:49.710 --> 02:43:50.300
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they've,</v>

3941
02:43:50.350 --> 02:43:55.350
<v Speaker 6>they've,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they've studied the heard the train and </v>

3942
02:43:55.350 --> 02:43:58.121
<v Speaker 6>all these different animals and how,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how they've been getting sick or how </v>

3943
02:43:58.121 --> 02:44:01.721
<v Speaker 6>healthy they are,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how many infants they've had and all </v>

3944
02:44:01.721 --> 02:44:04.121
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and they calculate how many tags they </v>

3945
02:44:04.121 --> 02:44:04.190
<v Speaker 6>can allow to give out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then there's even for dose,</v>

3946
02:44:04.220 --> 02:44:09.220
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well you have to go into a lottery to </v>

3947
02:44:09.220 --> 02:44:09.220
<v Speaker 6>get a doe tag to go ahead and be able to</v>
<v Speaker 6>hunt a doe.</v>

3948
02:44:09.220 --> 02:44:12.530
<v Speaker 6>And so that's kind of that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That whole figure has come up by,</v>

3949
02:44:12.660 --> 02:44:15.140
<v Speaker 6>by being on top of what's going on with </v>
<v Speaker 6>the animals.</v>

3950
02:44:15.190 --> 02:44:16.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's knowledge.</v>

3951
02:44:16.240 --> 02:44:20.260
<v Speaker 2>It's based on people who are actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're concerned about the environment,</v>

3952
02:44:20.280 --> 02:44:21.040
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not trying to get.</v>

3953
02:44:21.041 --> 02:44:26.041
<v Speaker 2>No one's getting rich off of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all passionate hunters and they </v>

3954
02:44:26.041 --> 02:44:26.041
<v Speaker 2>want to conserve the environment under </v>
<v Speaker 2>his love,</v>

3955
02:44:26.041 --> 02:44:30.380
<v Speaker 6>the environment and some of the most </v>
<v Speaker 6>environmentally responsible and </v>

3956
02:44:30.380 --> 02:44:32.520
<v Speaker 6>important organization in the world are </v>
<v Speaker 6>full of basically.</v>

3957
02:44:32.530 --> 02:44:32.670
<v Speaker 6>Huh?</v>

3958
02:44:32.940 --> 02:44:37.940
<v Speaker 2>And there's a problem that people don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand when you advocate against </v>

3959
02:44:37.940 --> 02:44:37.940
<v Speaker 2>hunting is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3960
02:44:37.940 --> 02:44:42.691
<v Speaker 2>if you're not the top of the food chain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you better bring somebody in who's </v>

3961
02:44:42.691 --> 02:44:42.691
<v Speaker 2>going to do the dirty work because if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>

3962
02:44:42.691 --> 02:44:43.770
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have all these prey </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals.</v>

3963
02:44:43.771 --> 02:44:45.670
<v Speaker 2>They're going to be running rampant all </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the place.</v>

3964
02:44:45.671 --> 02:44:47.770
<v Speaker 2>You have to do something because there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>not enough food.</v>

3965
02:44:48.040 --> 02:44:51.370
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea that if you don't kill them,</v>

3966
02:44:51.371 --> 02:44:54.670
<v Speaker 2>they're just gonna be okay and peaceful </v>
<v Speaker 2>and live with us.</v>

3967
02:44:54.700 --> 02:44:56.470
<v Speaker 2>You're crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to slam into cars,</v>

3968
02:44:56.590 --> 02:45:01.590
<v Speaker 2>they're going to die of starvation and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have a Predator </v>

3969
02:45:01.590 --> 02:45:01.590
<v Speaker 2>population increase.</v>

3970
02:45:01.590 --> 02:45:05.460
<v Speaker 6>There's a responsibility as human beings</v>
<v Speaker 6>on this planet and our involvement in </v>

3971
02:45:05.460 --> 02:45:07.180
<v Speaker 6>this planet's ecosystem can manage that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We have to,</v>

3972
02:45:07.210 --> 02:45:08.980
<v Speaker 6>we have to work on managing it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>

3973
02:45:08.981 --> 02:45:10.390
<v Speaker 6>and that's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I mean,</v>

3974
02:45:10.480 --> 02:45:13.630
<v Speaker 6>but I think it should be more difficult </v>
<v Speaker 6>to get a car.</v>

3975
02:45:13.720 --> 02:45:14.520
<v Speaker 6>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I agree.</v>

3976
02:45:14.550 --> 02:45:15.730
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I agree,</v>

3977
02:45:15.790 --> 02:45:17.440
<v Speaker 6>it's 70.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Think of it as a right,</v>

3978
02:45:17.441 --> 02:45:20.170
<v Speaker 6>76,000</v>
<v Speaker 6>people were involved in fatal crashes.</v>

3979
02:45:20.171 --> 02:45:22.600
<v Speaker 6>Now they didn't die,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that's 76,000</v>

3980
02:45:22.601 --> 02:45:25.630
<v Speaker 6>fucking people that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How many of those could have been solved</v>

3981
02:45:25.631 --> 02:45:28.240
<v Speaker 6>by not texting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Irresponsible bullshit.</v>

3982
02:45:28.241 --> 02:45:29.050
<v Speaker 6>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3983
02:45:29.051 --> 02:45:32.080
<v Speaker 6>it should be a lot more difficult to get</v>
<v Speaker 6>behind the wheel and I want that kind of</v>

3984
02:45:32.081 --> 02:45:34.270
<v Speaker 6>responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would love to see that to,</v>

3985
02:45:34.330 --> 02:45:37.060
<v Speaker 6>for someone to own a firearm.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then even besides that,</v>

3986
02:45:37.330 --> 02:45:39.040
<v Speaker 6>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let's say you take all the guns away,</v>

3987
02:45:39.400 --> 02:45:44.400
<v Speaker 6>if we have people that are doped up or </v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking crazy or whatever and they're </v>

3988
02:45:44.400 --> 02:45:45.400
<v Speaker 6>going out,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let's say say the Batman guy just walked</v>

3989
02:45:45.401 --> 02:45:48.170
<v Speaker 6>into the theater with an ax and he </v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking nailed three people.</v>

3990
02:45:48.170 --> 02:45:53.170
<v Speaker 6>He just.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Three people die for no fucking good </v>

3991
02:45:53.170 --> 02:45:53.170
<v Speaker 6>reason,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3992
02:45:53.170 --> 02:45:53.590
<v Speaker 6>But the idea is it's not 33 because he </v>
<v Speaker 6>doesn't have guns.</v>

3993
02:45:53.591 --> 02:45:54.790
<v Speaker 6>He's not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's not wearing.</v>

3994
02:45:54.820 --> 02:45:59.820
<v Speaker 6>And I'm not going to give any examples </v>
<v Speaker 6>because I'm not that asshole like a lot </v>

3995
02:45:59.820 --> 02:46:00.070
<v Speaker 6>of the media.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3996
02:46:00.071 --> 02:46:01.200
<v Speaker 6>where they'll sit there and say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

3997
02:46:01.360 --> 02:46:02.050
<v Speaker 6>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 6>guess what?</v>

3998
02:46:02.051 --> 02:46:03.400
<v Speaker 6>This is how you made x,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Y,</v>

3999
02:46:03.401 --> 02:46:08.401
<v Speaker 6>Z or how you do this and give a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>information out there to people so they </v>

4000
02:46:08.401 --> 02:46:08.401
<v Speaker 6>can go out and some other Wacko can do </v>
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>

4001
02:46:08.401 --> 02:46:12.901
<v Speaker 6>but look,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I could sit here with you in private </v>

4002
02:46:12.901 --> 02:46:15.371
<v Speaker 6>until you at least three different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I probably could've killed everybody in </v>

4003
02:46:15.371 --> 02:46:15.371
<v Speaker 6>that theater.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

4004
02:46:15.371 --> 02:46:20.170
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's way the more strategic about it </v>

4005
02:46:20.170 --> 02:46:21.750
<v Speaker 6>and the thing is why we got to solve the</v>
<v Speaker 6>problem of,</v>

4006
02:46:21.751 --> 02:46:24.950
<v Speaker 6>of our populace murdering the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 6>us.</v>

4007
02:46:24.970 --> 02:46:29.970
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But you and it's America and it's a </v>

4008
02:46:29.970 --> 02:46:29.970
<v Speaker 6>total rare a thing as it is.</v>

4009
02:46:29.970 --> 02:46:32.160
<v Speaker 6>Like if you added up all the people that</v>
<v Speaker 6>out of how many we have in the,</v>

4010
02:46:32.200 --> 02:46:34.940
<v Speaker 6>in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in America versus how many are are,</v>

4011
02:46:34.970 --> 02:46:37.910
<v Speaker 6>are coming under.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's still.</v>

4012
02:46:38.210 --> 02:46:41.210
<v Speaker 6>I mean in as pure statistics game,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're not.</v>

4013
02:46:41.420 --> 02:46:43.550
<v Speaker 6>It's not like it's still a fucking super</v>
<v Speaker 6>rare thing.</v>

4014
02:46:43.551 --> 02:46:48.551
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure there's a statistics person </v>
<v Speaker 6>that can tell you the likelihood of you </v>

4015
02:46:48.551 --> 02:46:49.730
<v Speaker 6>actually being involved in a shooting at</v>
<v Speaker 6>all in anywhere in America.</v>

4016
02:46:50.180 --> 02:46:55.180
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let's get down to the nitty gritty </v>

4017
02:46:55.180 --> 02:46:55.180
<v Speaker 6>because we only got a couple of minutes </v>
<v Speaker 6>left for you.</v>

4018
02:46:55.180 --> 02:46:55.180
<v Speaker 6>Turn into a pumpkin.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Three,</v>

4019
02:46:55.180 --> 02:46:56.870
<v Speaker 6>three hours were useless.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

4020
02:46:56.960 --> 02:46:59.180
<v Speaker 6>what,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what is the solution then?</v>

4021
02:46:59.210 --> 02:47:00.980
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is it arming schools?</v>

4022
02:47:01.010 --> 02:47:01.640
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Army.</v>

4023
02:47:01.641 --> 02:47:02.390
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>definitely not.</v>

4024
02:47:02.470 --> 02:47:07.470
<v Speaker 6>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's an armed guard and that kind of </v>

4025
02:47:07.470 --> 02:47:07.470
<v Speaker 6>shit from happening.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I had a,</v>

4026
02:47:07.470 --> 02:47:08.100
<v Speaker 6>we had an armed guard at our school.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like I,</v>

4027
02:47:08.450 --> 02:47:10.620
<v Speaker 6>I think there should at this point in A.</v>

4028
02:47:10.730 --> 02:47:12.210
<v Speaker 6>I don't think there's anything wrong </v>
<v Speaker 6>with an arm chair.</v>

4029
02:47:12.220 --> 02:47:13.340
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but we had armed,</v>

4030
02:47:13.341 --> 02:47:14.320
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>an arm.</v>

4031
02:47:14.350 --> 02:47:15.530
<v Speaker 6>Just a police officer.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4032
02:47:15.650 --> 02:47:18.560
<v Speaker 6>We had an officer on our school and I </v>
<v Speaker 6>had a pretty gnarly school.</v>

4033
02:47:18.561 --> 02:47:19.550
<v Speaker 6>We didn't have shooting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

4034
02:47:19.551 --> 02:47:24.551
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guess we did have a shooting girl got </v>

4035
02:47:24.551 --> 02:47:24.551
<v Speaker 6>shot in the face seven times by some </v>
<v Speaker 6>little Asian gangster kid.</v>

4036
02:47:24.551 --> 02:47:24.551
<v Speaker 6>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But,</v>

4037
02:47:24.551 --> 02:47:27.440
<v Speaker 6>and then we had a girl got shot in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you know,</v>

4038
02:47:27.441 --> 02:47:30.170
<v Speaker 6>and that was fucking super tragic.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>

4039
02:47:30.470 --> 02:47:35.470
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the key to all of that also is that she </v>

4040
02:47:35.470 --> 02:47:36.650
<v Speaker 6>was hanging around all these bad fucking</v>
<v Speaker 6>dudes and these bad dudes were doing bad</v>

4041
02:47:36.651 --> 02:47:37.360
<v Speaker 6>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you know,</v>

4042
02:47:37.370 --> 02:47:42.370
<v Speaker 6>it's like if you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not like they came down to just to </v>

4043
02:47:42.370 --> 02:47:42.370
<v Speaker 6>shoot anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

4044
02:47:42.370 --> 02:47:46.990
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think they didn't even come to </v>

4045
02:47:46.990 --> 02:47:46.990
<v Speaker 6>shoot her specifically and it's just </v>
<v Speaker 6>like a.</v>

4046
02:47:46.990 --> 02:47:50.780
<v Speaker 6>and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>why do these kids want to live this </v>

4047
02:47:50.780 --> 02:47:52.010
<v Speaker 6>lifestyle where they're running around </v>
<v Speaker 6>shooting each other anyways,</v>

4048
02:47:52.100 --> 02:47:57.100
<v Speaker 6>what?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's just like fucked up parents </v>

4049
02:47:57.100 --> 02:47:57.100
<v Speaker 6>to live education,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever,</v>

4050
02:47:57.100 --> 02:47:59.770
<v Speaker 6>and then it ends up in this girl getting</v>
<v Speaker 6>shot and it's pointless.</v>

4051
02:47:59.780 --> 02:48:04.780
<v Speaker 6>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we had an awesome solution that NRA </v>

4052
02:48:04.780 --> 02:48:07.130
<v Speaker 6>rhetoric about putting guards and I in </v>
<v Speaker 6>front of all these fucking schools,</v>

4053
02:48:07.131 --> 02:48:12.131
<v Speaker 6>like that doesn't change the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What if we took all the guards that are </v>

4054
02:48:12.131 --> 02:48:13.940
<v Speaker 6>working for the dea,</v>
<v Speaker 6>have them guard the schools.</v>

4055
02:48:13.941 --> 02:48:18.941
<v Speaker 6>We killed two birds with which we just </v>
<v Speaker 6>put one of them in every school so that </v>

4056
02:48:18.941 --> 02:48:22.721
<v Speaker 6>you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And maybe these people could not only </v>

4057
02:48:22.721 --> 02:48:22.721
<v Speaker 6>just be in the school of standing around</v>
<v Speaker 6>with a gun,</v>

4058
02:48:22.721 --> 02:48:26.441
<v Speaker 6>but maybe they could also be an </v>
<v Speaker 6>influence on people as far as like just </v>

4059
02:48:26.441 --> 02:48:26.441
<v Speaker 6>being like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hey,</v>

4060
02:48:26.441 --> 02:48:27.170
<v Speaker 6>guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm here to defend you,</v>

4061
02:48:27.200 --> 02:48:30.680
<v Speaker 6>but I'm doing it as an upright fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>citizen and this is why it's important.</v>

4062
02:48:31.100 --> 02:48:33.260
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that would be like a volunteer sort of a</v>

4063
02:48:33.261 --> 02:48:35.330
<v Speaker 6>militia type thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is that what you mean?</v>

4064
02:48:35.760 --> 02:48:36.770
<v Speaker 6>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

4065
02:48:36.771 --> 02:48:39.200
<v Speaker 6>he doesn't like that shit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but even if it was regulated,</v>

4066
02:48:39.230 --> 02:48:40.580
<v Speaker 6>I'm cool with that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm just saying that,</v>

4067
02:48:40.610 --> 02:48:41.900
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>do one further.</v>

4068
02:48:41.930 --> 02:48:42.530
<v Speaker 6>My,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my,</v>

4069
02:48:42.590 --> 02:48:47.590
<v Speaker 6>my point where I'm getting to with this </v>
<v Speaker 6>is that it's not just the having an </v>

4070
02:48:47.590 --> 02:48:50.651
<v Speaker 6>armed guard.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Here's the thing that helps change this </v>

4071
02:48:50.651 --> 02:48:53.830
<v Speaker 6>from,</v>
<v Speaker 6>from people just blindly shooting each </v>

4072
02:48:53.830 --> 02:48:55.871
<v Speaker 6>other and whatever community.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We don't have any fucking community </v>

4073
02:48:55.871 --> 02:48:59.351
<v Speaker 6>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No one's responsible and when I say </v>

4074
02:48:59.351 --> 02:48:59.351
<v Speaker 6>responsible,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're not just respond.</v>

4075
02:48:59.351 --> 02:49:02.740
<v Speaker 6>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just responsible for yourself in a </v>

4076
02:49:02.740 --> 02:49:02.740
<v Speaker 6>community.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You keep an eye out,</v>

4077
02:49:02.740 --> 02:49:02.900
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you got some crazy fucking psycho kid.</v>

4078
02:49:03.110 --> 02:49:04.790
<v Speaker 6>Keep an eye on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Let other people know.</v>

4079
02:49:04.791 --> 02:49:05.570
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hey,</v>

4080
02:49:05.571 --> 02:49:10.571
<v Speaker 6>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 6>tom is actually fucking weird right now </v>

4081
02:49:10.571 --> 02:49:10.770
<v Speaker 6>and we need to be aware of that so that </v>
<v Speaker 6>he,</v>

4082
02:49:10.810 --> 02:49:12.500
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>everybody just work.</v>

4083
02:49:12.501 --> 02:49:14.790
<v Speaker 6>Everybody just wants a little mom's </v>
<v Speaker 6>house nowadays.</v>

4084
02:49:14.880 --> 02:49:16.110
<v Speaker 6>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's my example.</v>

4085
02:49:16.111 --> 02:49:18.750
<v Speaker 6>They just want a big hand to come over </v>
<v Speaker 6>and wash all their laundry,</v>

4086
02:49:18.751 --> 02:49:23.751
<v Speaker 6>do everything,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and they don't want to see or be a part </v>

4087
02:49:23.751 --> 02:49:23.751
<v Speaker 6>of the process and made all that happen </v>
<v Speaker 6>anymore.</v>

4088
02:49:23.751 --> 02:49:23.751
<v Speaker 6>I think that</v>

4089
02:49:23.880 --> 02:49:28.880
<v Speaker 2>random or sort of a big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>broad way community is definitely the </v>

4090
02:49:28.880 --> 02:49:31.710
<v Speaker 2>answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that what's going on now,</v>

4091
02:49:31.711 --> 02:49:36.711
<v Speaker 2>what we were talking about with Internet</v>
<v Speaker 2>trolls and people getting exposed and </v>

4092
02:49:36.711 --> 02:49:37.560
<v Speaker 2>realizing that anonymity is slowly </v>
<v Speaker 2>slipping away.</v>

4093
02:49:37.920 --> 02:49:42.920
<v Speaker 2>I think ultimately that's going to lead </v>
<v Speaker 2>to a bigger sense of community because </v>

4094
02:49:42.920 --> 02:49:44.400
<v Speaker 2>we're going to have repercussions for </v>
<v Speaker 2>actions and thoughts.</v>

4095
02:49:44.401 --> 02:49:49.401
<v Speaker 2>Homes are going to have access to each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other in a way that I don't think we've </v>

4096
02:49:49.401 --> 02:49:52.401
<v Speaker 2>ever had before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm hoping that this is a stage of </v>

4097
02:49:52.401 --> 02:49:55.881
<v Speaker 2>humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we are really involved in some </v>

4098
02:49:55.881 --> 02:49:57.280
<v Speaker 2>sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a more,</v>

4099
02:49:57.610 --> 02:49:59.810
<v Speaker 2>a metamorphosis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4100
02:49:59.970 --> 02:50:04.970
<v Speaker 2>growing and developing because of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>technology and because of this sort of </v>

4101
02:50:04.970 --> 02:50:04.970
<v Speaker 2>connection that people share with </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

4102
02:50:04.970 --> 02:50:09.450
<v Speaker 2>And I don't want to be live in society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to overstate it,</v>

4103
02:50:09.451 --> 02:50:14.451
<v Speaker 2>but that's the feeling that I get from </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that benefit from this show on </v>

4104
02:50:14.451 --> 02:50:17.331
<v Speaker 2>the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the things that people benefit </v>

4105
02:50:17.331 --> 02:50:19.281
<v Speaker 2>from reading things and being exposed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>things and lectures and Ted talks and </v>

4106
02:50:19.281 --> 02:50:19.780
<v Speaker 2>shit that they really wouldn't have had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that</v>

4107
02:50:19.830 --> 02:50:21.260
<v Speaker 6>we need to participate more.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

4108
02:50:21.261 --> 02:50:26.261
<v Speaker 6>it's one thing to listen.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's another thing to to to listen to a </v>

4109
02:50:26.261 --> 02:50:27.380
<v Speaker 6>show and then stay in your own fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>bubble and never participate in the rest</v>

4110
02:50:27.381 --> 02:50:29.240
<v Speaker 6>of your community.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You need to be a part of your community,</v>

4111
02:50:29.260 --> 02:50:32.570
<v Speaker 6>need to be to know your fellow man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You need to know your fucking neighbor.</v>

4112
02:50:32.571 --> 02:50:34.880
<v Speaker 6>You need to know you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The more you're a part of this,</v>

<v Speaker 6>random drone that nobody knows or ever </v>

4114
02:50:39.881 --> 02:50:43.121
<v Speaker 6>know and now you're a human being that </v>
<v Speaker 6>the interacts with other human beings </v>

4115
02:50:43.121 --> 02:50:44.200
<v Speaker 6>and now you're forming this greater and </v>
<v Speaker 6>stronger bond that's gonna.</v>

4116
02:50:44.210 --> 02:50:45.110
<v Speaker 6>Look out for each other.</v>

4117
02:50:45.140 --> 02:50:50.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to sort of somehow or another </v>

4118
02:50:50.140 --> 02:50:51.800
<v Speaker 2>feel a need for that and as a society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a society,</v>

4119
02:50:51.801 --> 02:50:55.430
<v Speaker 2>figure out how to engineer that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sense of community again,</v>

4120
02:50:55.431 --> 02:50:58.190
<v Speaker 2>and I've been trying to get all my </v>
<v Speaker 2>friends to move on the same block,</v>

4121
02:50:58.490 --> 02:51:01.850
<v Speaker 2>but none of these motherfuckers are </v>
<v Speaker 2>willing to move out to my neighborhood.</v>

4122
02:51:02.150 --> 02:51:04.610
<v Speaker 2>We're going to have to buy a patch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>land and do it cult style.</v>

4123
02:51:05.210 --> 02:51:06.740

<v Speaker 2>to like have most of your friends like </v>
<v Speaker 2>in your neighborhood,</v>

4126
02:51:11.820 --> 02:51:14.390

<v Speaker 2>shirt with strangers,</v>

4127
02:51:14.570 --> 02:51:16.010
<v Speaker 2>which is how most of us live.</v>

4128
02:51:16.060 --> 02:51:17.680
<v Speaker 6>Or even if we're in a neighborhood full </v>
<v Speaker 6>of strangers,</v>

4129
02:51:17.681 --> 02:51:19.940
<v Speaker 6>why don't we make the time to make them </v>

<v Speaker 6>Johnny Knoxville.</v>

4163
02:52:31.850 --> 02:52:33.740
<v Speaker 6>But everything about the dude is based </v>

<v Speaker 6>Now he becomes part of the assassin's </v>

4168
02:52:46.331 --> 02:52:46.331
<v Speaker 6>guild.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't think we really got to the </v>

4185
02:53:22.160 --> 02:53:22.160
<v Speaker 2>bottom of this because I don't think you</v>

4186
02:53:22.160 --> 02:53:25.171
<v Speaker 2>but I know it's your insight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially as an intelligent guy and </v>

4187
02:53:25.171 --> 02:53:30.060
<v Speaker 2>you're allowed to fucking enjoy fighting</v>
<v Speaker 2>and guns and allowed to enjoy all these </v>

02:57:37.550 --> 02:57:38.990
<v Speaker 3>Not Talk about that junior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the deal.</v>

4295
02:57:39.140 --> 02:57:44.140
<v Speaker 3>Cane doesn't get his take down game </v>
<v Speaker 3>going with his distance on a striking </v>

4296
02:57:44.140 --> 02:57:47.800
<v Speaker 3>early on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Juniors dictating pace and distance </v>

4297
02:57:47.800 --> 02:57:50.050
<v Speaker 3>on unstopped and the takedown,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the only going to farms away.</v>

4298
02:57:50.060 --> 02:57:51.290
<v Speaker 3>He's going to take them out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

4299
02:57:51.291 --> 02:57:56.291
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he's going to one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>punch him again because he's not </v>

4300
02:57:56.291 --> 02:57:58.391
<v Speaker 3>normally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not normally a one punch knockout </v>

4301
02:57:58.391 --> 02:57:58.391
<v Speaker 3>guy as you've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he,</v>

4302
02:57:58.391 --> 02:58:01.451
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his head high accuracy is very high and </v>

4303
02:58:01.451 --> 02:58:01.451
<v Speaker 3>he'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'll pick it apart if can,</v>

4304
02:58:01.451 --> 02:58:02.220
<v Speaker 3>can get his down game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his timing</v>

4305
02:58:02.220 --> 02:58:05.460
<v Speaker 6>on,</v>
<v Speaker 6>on fighting junior to initiate and score</v>

4306
02:58:05.461 --> 02:58:07.290
<v Speaker 6>the takedown early on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If he can get it,</v>

4307
02:58:07.291 --> 02:58:10.620
<v Speaker 6>go and be successful with it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he can win that fight the APP.</v>

4308
02:58:10.920 --> 02:58:13.250
<v Speaker 6>No one's ever been able to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's an amazing thing about dosantos.</v>

4309
02:58:13.590 --> 02:58:16.670
<v Speaker 6>People are always so afraid of fighting </v>
<v Speaker 6>him on the feet problem.</v>

4310
02:58:16.680 --> 02:58:21.680
<v Speaker 6>You,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's just like we talked about what </v>

4311
02:58:21.680 --> 02:58:22.820
<v Speaker 6>Croak theater wasn't going to take him </v>
<v Speaker 6>down if he wasn't getting in his face </v>

4312
02:58:22.820 --> 02:58:22.820
<v Speaker 6>and slugging them out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you know,</v>

4313
02:58:22.820 --> 02:58:23.940
<v Speaker 6>juniors got great feet,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is tough,</v>

4314
02:58:24.270 --> 02:58:25.980
<v Speaker 6>but a cane can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Came,</v>

4315
02:58:26.000 --> 02:58:26.940
<v Speaker 6>has enough.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If he,</v>

4316
02:58:26.941 --> 02:58:30.960
<v Speaker 6>if he's smart enough and if he can get </v>
<v Speaker 6>the right mindset,</v>

4317
02:58:31.170 --> 02:58:31.610
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he,</v>

4318
02:58:31.700 --> 02:58:36.700
<v Speaker 6>he can put,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he put on his back and once it starts </v>

4319
02:58:36.700 --> 02:58:36.700
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it'll,</v>

4320
02:58:36.700 --> 02:58:36.700
<v Speaker 6>it'll,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it can continue.</v>

4321
02:58:36.700 --> 02:58:37.480
<v Speaker 6>You can keep doing it right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can't,</v>

4322
02:58:37.550 --> 02:58:40.020
<v Speaker 6>you get that timing down and all of a </v>
<v Speaker 6>sudden you pick up on that,</v>

4323
02:58:40.021 --> 02:58:45.021
<v Speaker 6>that Shoulder Movement for that jab </v>
<v Speaker 6>comes and you fake out you overhand </v>

4324
02:58:45.021 --> 02:58:48.380
<v Speaker 6>right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then stop and you go right into the </v>

4325
02:58:48.380 --> 02:58:50.181
<v Speaker 6>take down or you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you pull them forward with some strikes </v>

4326
02:58:50.181 --> 02:58:50.181
<v Speaker 6>and then he thinks it's some exchange </v>
<v Speaker 6>and boom,</v>

4327
02:58:50.181 --> 02:58:50.181
<v Speaker 6>you get them on it.</v>

4328
02:58:50.181 --> 02:58:54.930
<v Speaker 2>I think another interesting aspect of it</v>
<v Speaker 2>can be if cain could take him into the </v>

4329
02:58:54.930 --> 02:58:56.310
<v Speaker 2>fourth and fifth round because canes </v>
<v Speaker 2>known for his legendary Cardio,</v>

4330
02:58:56.360 --> 02:59:01.360
<v Speaker 6>he ain't gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's still not going to be successful </v>

4331
02:59:01.360 --> 02:59:01.580
<v Speaker 6>and less he gets that takedown.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

4332
02:59:01.610 --> 02:59:03.890
<v Speaker 6>that timing down.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If he doesn't get that timing down,</v>

4333
02:59:04.390 --> 02:59:05.600
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it won't even matter.</v>

4334
02:59:05.640 --> 02:59:08.370
<v Speaker 2>Powerful words from Josh Barnett.</v>
