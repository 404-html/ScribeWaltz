41
00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.430

<v Speaker 2>turned down to blue date.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Blue Gate on the right hand side,</v>

49
00:02:13.091 --> 00:02:17.590
<v Speaker 2>there's a blue chicken coop and it looks</v>
<v Speaker 2>like every year for 10 years the same</v>

50
00:02:17.591 --> 00:02:19.090
<v Speaker 2>kids come out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They never get older,</v>

51
00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.550
<v Speaker 2>they don't have shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're smiling.</v>

52
00:02:21.551 --> 00:02:22.960
<v Speaker 2>We hand up stickers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I stopped them,</v>

53
00:02:22.961 --> 00:02:24.100
<v Speaker 2>give him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I give him candy,</v>

54
00:02:24.101 --> 00:02:25.960
<v Speaker 2>I talked to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The heat signs,</v>

55
00:02:25.961 --> 00:02:26.920
<v Speaker 2>autographs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you take pictures,</v>

56
00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.560
<v Speaker 2>you go back the next year they look the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same age and they,</v>

57
00:02:30.561 --> 00:02:32.980
<v Speaker 2>and they live job telling you chicken</v>
<v Speaker 2>coop.</v>

58
00:02:32.981 --> 00:02:34.120
<v Speaker 2>I can draw it for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

59
00:02:34.121 --> 00:02:35.890
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a fucking chicken coop.</v>

60
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.580
<v Speaker 2>It looks like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a chicken coop,</v>

61
00:02:38.581 --> 00:02:40.600
<v Speaker 2>but it's not funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you appreciate,</v>

62
00:02:40.601 --> 00:02:43.420
<v Speaker 2>you come back and sometimes you look at</v>
<v Speaker 2>your kids and other people who kids</v>

63
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.290
<v Speaker 2>make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have no idea how easy your habit.</v>

64
00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then sometimes the kid,</v>

65
00:02:47.531 --> 00:02:49.360
<v Speaker 2>that chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll go to the dump and that's where</v>

66
00:02:49.361 --> 00:02:52.930
<v Speaker 2>they find metal and they find scrap and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they take the aluminum cans and they get</v>

67
00:02:52.931 --> 00:02:54.850
<v Speaker 2>their money and they're happy to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're happy.</v>

68
00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:55.960
<v Speaker 2>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not negative.</v>

69
00:02:55.961 --> 00:02:59.860
<v Speaker 2>They're not pissed off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think part of the reason was lucky</v>

70
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.880
<v Speaker 3>is I tried to put myself in a position</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get lucky,</v>

71
00:03:03.881 --> 00:03:07.420
<v Speaker 3>which is by playing more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And believe it or not,</v>

72
00:03:07.421 --> 00:03:10.090
<v Speaker 3>it's van Halen that influence that on</v>
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

73
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.500
<v Speaker 3>They were playing more than everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They played three blocks from my house</v>

74
00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:15.700
<v Speaker 3>in a backyard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now Mani,</v>

75
00:03:15.701 --> 00:03:17.290
<v Speaker 3>I paid $1 to get in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

76
00:03:17.291 --> 00:03:21.880
<v Speaker 3>the singer Roth was blowing a tube</v>
<v Speaker 3>inside of this guy's drums.</v>

77
00:03:21.881 --> 00:03:23.230
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going,</v>

78
00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.040
<v Speaker 3>whoa man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these guys are are,</v>

79
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:26.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

80
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.680
<v Speaker 3>I thought they were great and</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

81
00:03:27.681 --> 00:03:30.250
<v Speaker 3>And there are plenty of cover songs and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it played a couple of originals I think.</v>

82
00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:35.251
<v Speaker 3>But what I was more impressed by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least at that time was how often they</v>

83
00:03:35.291 --> 00:03:37.900
<v Speaker 3>played,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they played every single night.</v>

84
00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.630
<v Speaker 3>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got to do that if we're going to have</v>

85
00:03:40.631 --> 00:03:41.920
<v Speaker 3>any chance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

86
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.940
<v Speaker 3>because my thinking was if we play more</v>
<v Speaker 3>than everybody might have to play free a</v>

87
00:03:46.941 --> 00:03:49.050
<v Speaker 3>lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if our name,</v>

88
00:03:49.051 --> 00:03:50.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we might be able to brainwash people in</v>

89
00:03:50.931 --> 00:03:52.780
<v Speaker 3>thinking they're supposed to like us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

90
00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.260
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

91
00:03:56.261 --> 00:03:58.780
<v Speaker 3>and that's what happened though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was that persistence.</v>

92
00:03:58.781 --> 00:04:00.750
<v Speaker 3>It was that playing free,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

93
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.470
<v Speaker 3>getting our name out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

94
00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.870
<v Speaker 3>we just happened to be at the whiskey</v>
<v Speaker 3>one night,</v>

95
00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.040
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>playing,</v>

96
00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:07.690
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>during the week,</v>

97
00:04:07.691 --> 00:04:09.820
<v Speaker 3>not even a big night or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

98
00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.390
<v Speaker 3>and the right guy was in the crowd that</v>
<v Speaker 3>lie and he came up,</v>

99
00:04:13.391 --> 00:04:14.620
<v Speaker 3>gave us his card.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And before,</v>

100
00:04:14.621 --> 00:04:15.454
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

101

<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

102
00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.470
<v Speaker 3>we got air plague.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't even have a record deal.</v>

103
00:04:20.471 --> 00:04:21.220
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

104
00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:26.220
<v Speaker 3>our record deal was literally borrowing</v>
<v Speaker 3>15 grand from some guy named Fred.</v>

105
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.630
<v Speaker 3>Hey Fred,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got 15 grand?</v>

106
00:04:28.631 --> 00:04:29.464
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

107
00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.690
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we had a distribution deal.</v>

108
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.620
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this manager,</v>

109
00:04:35.621 --> 00:04:38.320
<v Speaker 3>we had called El and Nivon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was from England.</v>

110
00:04:38.321 --> 00:04:41.590
<v Speaker 3>He used to work for virgin records.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had signed Berlin,</v>

111
00:04:41.591 --> 00:04:45.490
<v Speaker 3>he signed motley crew and a year before</v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

112
00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:46.400
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

113
00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.690
<v Speaker 3>then they would sell these bands off to</v>
<v Speaker 3>big labels.</v>

114
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:55.120
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he got us on Camy t when we had no deal</v>

115
00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.650
<v Speaker 3>and no local bands were on Kamia and</v>
<v Speaker 3>Keller West with no deal.</v>

116
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.260
<v Speaker 3>It was just unheard of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

117
00:05:02.261 --> 00:05:04.900
<v Speaker 3>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what kind of connection he</v>

118
00:05:04.901 --> 00:05:05.150
<v Speaker 3>had.</v>

119
00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.690
<v Speaker 2>So it was just a matter of you being</v>
<v Speaker 2>persistent planning all the time and</v>

120
00:05:08.691 --> 00:05:11.150
<v Speaker 2>this guy saw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's such an important lesson for,</v>

121
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.610
<v Speaker 2>for young people who are thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing something.</v>

122
00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.050
<v Speaker 2>Sure opportunity presents itself when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just fucking buster and dream it and</v>

123
00:05:18.051 --> 00:05:19.790
<v Speaker 2>dream it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is one of the things,</v>

124
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.700
<v Speaker 2>especially talking to college students</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I love bringing up,</v>

125
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.590
<v Speaker 2>which is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm the first to admit it,</v>

126
00:05:24.591 --> 00:05:27.830
<v Speaker 2>like I have no fucking clue what I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing 99% of the time,</v>

127
00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:30.470
<v Speaker 2>even especially when I got started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still don't know.</v>

128
00:05:30.471 --> 00:05:32.030
<v Speaker 2>And I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've come to realize like,</v>

129
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.850
<v Speaker 2>and I've got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got been lucky enough to meet some</v>

130
00:05:34.851 --> 00:05:36.500
<v Speaker 2>pretty successful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>impressive people.</v>

131
00:05:36.501 --> 00:05:39.140
<v Speaker 2>But like you dig under the surface,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're all just hacking it.</v>

132
00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.990
<v Speaker 2>Like we're all just for expertise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience,</v>

133
00:05:40.991 --> 00:05:43.910
<v Speaker 2>those things all help.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like every one of us is a fallible</v>

134
00:05:43.911 --> 00:05:44.420
<v Speaker 2>human.</v>

135
00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:48.710
<v Speaker 2>All the conventions and rules and status</v>
<v Speaker 2>quo we know were created by other</v>

136
00:05:48.711 --> 00:05:51.620
<v Speaker 2>fallible humans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's no reason not to look at</v>

137
00:05:51.621 --> 00:05:52.520
<v Speaker 2>that and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh,</v>

138
00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.800
<v Speaker 2>does it have to be that way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or why is it that way?</v>

139
00:05:54.801 --> 00:05:57.020
<v Speaker 2>And if the reason why is low,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the way it,</v>

140
00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.580
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a terrible reason,</v>

141
00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:00.080
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

142
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.600
<v Speaker 2>and when you see the world as being that</v>
<v Speaker 2>hackable,</v>

143
00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:04.670
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you start to realize,</v>

144
00:06:04.671 --> 00:06:05.301
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well let's just,</v>

145
00:06:05.301 --> 00:06:06.840
<v Speaker 2>let's actually question stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

146
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:07.730
<v Speaker 2>and for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

147
00:06:07.731 --> 00:06:12.590
<v Speaker 2>I remember I was a freshman at Uva when</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine 11 happened for this generation of</v>

148
00:06:12.591 --> 00:06:15.080
<v Speaker 2>millennials coming up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We mow nearly all of us.</v>

149
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:18.320
<v Speaker 2>One of our first really vivid memories</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the world was nine 11,</v>

150
00:06:18.321 --> 00:06:22.130
<v Speaker 2>this awful tragedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we get into these two wars and</v>

151
00:06:22.131 --> 00:06:25.340
<v Speaker 2>then think of all the authority figures</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've had in our life since that moment.</v>

152
00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.410
<v Speaker 2>They've all at one point another either</v>
<v Speaker 2>misled us,</v>

153
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.270
<v Speaker 2>this sort of deceived us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

154
00:06:29.271 --> 00:06:32.180
<v Speaker 2>you've got the financial crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got the housing bubble,</v>

155
00:06:32.181 --> 00:06:33.590
<v Speaker 2>all these conventions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

156
00:06:33.591 --> 00:06:34.670
<v Speaker 2>trust us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know what we're doing.</v>

157
00:06:34.671 --> 00:06:36.410
<v Speaker 2>This is the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the American dream is buying a home,</v>

158
00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.480
<v Speaker 2>go to college,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take on that student loan debt.</v>

159
00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:40.250
<v Speaker 2>Don't worry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a job waiting for you.</v>

160
00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:41.930
<v Speaker 2>Every single one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These conventions from,</v>

161
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.420
<v Speaker 2>from all these people in power have not</v>
<v Speaker 2>held up.</v>

162
00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.610
<v Speaker 2>And so I think in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>millennials,</v>

163
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:48.830
<v Speaker 2>millennials look at that very</v>
<v Speaker 2>skeptically cause we were like,</v>

164
00:06:48.831 --> 00:06:49.664
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

165
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.010
<v Speaker 2>So the conventional stuff didn't work</v>
<v Speaker 2>out for anything.</v>

166
00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:53.810
<v Speaker 2>Like we have no choice but to realize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

167
00:06:53.811 --> 00:06:55.100
<v Speaker 2>We're all just hacking it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's,</v>

168
00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:56.960
<v Speaker 2>let's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's dive into the passion.</v>

169
00:06:56.961 --> 00:06:58.700
<v Speaker 2>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's figure out a better way to do</v>

170
00:06:58.701 --> 00:07:01.160
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Settle for the way they've always</v>

171
00:07:01.161 --> 00:07:01.770
<v Speaker 2>been.</v>

172
00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:01.840
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
