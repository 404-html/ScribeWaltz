00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.780
<v Speaker 1>The Joe Rogan experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times,</v>

2
00:00:02.781 --> 00:00:04.220
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't think about it that way</v>

3
00:00:04.221 --> 00:00:06.710
<v Speaker 1>because you think of morning is like</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you have to go to work.</v>

4
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.450
<v Speaker 1>It's human male.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this what?</v>

5
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.010
<v Speaker 1>Talking about human nature and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>just playing.</v>

6
00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:16.790
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How could that be possible?</v>

7
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.480
<v Speaker 1>Let me see that box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Taste it.</v>

8
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.070
<v Speaker 1>Taste it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's on that box.</v>

9
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.990
<v Speaker 1>It's right on the box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

10
00:00:32.991 --> 00:00:33.824
<v Speaker 1>it fell off.</v>

11
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.810
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's missing.</v>

12
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.710
<v Speaker 2>It's probably who.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wait.</v>

13
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:41.570
<v Speaker 2>Who was here last?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

14
00:00:41.571 --> 00:00:42.590
<v Speaker 2>it's probably dunkins</v>

15
00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.080
<v Speaker 1>nails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You imagine if you're.</v>

16
00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.230
<v Speaker 1>Do you want a podcast with someone?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You watched them trim them.</v>

17
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.780
<v Speaker 1>How's your doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you're doing like what the fuck are</v>

18
00:00:51.781 --> 00:00:54.390
<v Speaker 1>you doing with those gross thing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it will be over somewhere in this</v>

19
00:00:54.391 --> 00:00:57.900
<v Speaker 1>area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scanning the rest of the table.</v>

20
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.350
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm trying to find that one</v>
<v Speaker 1>who smokes joints with random strangers.</v>

21
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.810
<v Speaker 1>Who knows what kinds of fucking weird</v>
<v Speaker 1>fecal herpes you're passing around.</v>

22
00:01:09.811 --> 00:01:13.860
<v Speaker 1>When I put a toenail on my friends bond,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once he hit it and it smells.</v>

23
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.760
<v Speaker 2>That's not a friend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're an enemy posing as a friend.</v>

24
00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.250
<v Speaker 2>You're a terrible person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It burnt and smelled like hair.</v>

25
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.650
<v Speaker 2>Once you go to Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you call going to Mexico.</v>

26
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:27.570
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be Down there.</v>

27
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.530
<v Speaker 2>So you want to get home and that's part</v>
<v Speaker 2>of it too,</v>

28
00:01:29.531 --> 00:01:31.600
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Part of it too is like the disconnect,</v>

29
00:01:31.601 --> 00:01:33.160
<v Speaker 2>unplug,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unplugging,</v>

30
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.660
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

31
00:01:34.661 --> 00:01:39.490
<v Speaker 2>recharging your brain and being out</v>
<v Speaker 2>there and the desolate surroundings</v>

32
00:01:39.491 --> 00:01:42.010
<v Speaker 2>going 140 miles an hour over bumps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What gives you.</v>

33
00:01:42.011 --> 00:01:43.930
<v Speaker 2>There's another side of it too that</v>
<v Speaker 2>gives you appreciation.</v>

34
00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.330
<v Speaker 2>I have a kid now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I know my brother says to you on</v>

35
00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.550
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you also see the people,</v>

36
00:01:48.551 --> 00:01:50.470
<v Speaker 2>how they live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are kids,</v>

37
00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.740
<v Speaker 2>amazing kids and they live in chicken</v>
<v Speaker 2>coops,</v>

38
00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.210
<v Speaker 2>the Bluetooth coupon by a host.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They live in chicken coops.</v>

39
00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.400
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not kidding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying it's a blue chicken coop.</v>

40
00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:01.240
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>

41
00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.860
<v Speaker 2>And there's kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I actually call,</v>

42
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.320
<v Speaker 2>this is my little story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

43
00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:06.040
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

44
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.820
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

45
00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.860
<v Speaker 2>the kids that never grow up always come</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of Ohio.</v>

46
00:02:08.861 --> 00:02:11.330
<v Speaker 2>So there's a little road after you've</v>
<v Speaker 2>turned down to blue date,</v>

47
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.640
<v Speaker 2>the Blue Gate on the right hand side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a blue chicken coop and it looks</v>

48
00:02:15.641 --> 00:02:18.220
<v Speaker 2>like every year for 10 years the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>kids come out.</v>

49
00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:20.290
<v Speaker 2>They never get older.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't have shoes.</v>

50
00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.420
<v Speaker 2>They're smiling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We hand them stickers.</v>

51
00:02:22.421 --> 00:02:23.260
<v Speaker 2>I stopped them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give them.</v>

52
00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.880
<v Speaker 2>I give them candy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talked to him.</v>

53
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.920
<v Speaker 2>The he signs autographs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you take pictures,</v>

54
00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.200
<v Speaker 2>you go back the next year they look the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same age and they they live job telling</v>

55
00:02:32.201 --> 00:02:33.940
<v Speaker 2>you chicken coop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can draw it for you,</v>

56
00:02:33.941 --> 00:02:35.890
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a fucking chicken coop.</v>

57
00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.590
<v Speaker 2>It looks like it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a chicken coop,</v>

58
00:02:38.591 --> 00:02:40.600
<v Speaker 2>but it's not funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you appreciate.</v>

59
00:02:40.601 --> 00:02:43.420
<v Speaker 2>You come back and sometimes you look at</v>
<v Speaker 2>your kids and other people have kids</v>

60
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.290
<v Speaker 2>make.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have no idea how easy your habit.</v>

61
00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:47.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then sometimes the kid,</v>

62
00:02:47.531 --> 00:02:49.360
<v Speaker 2>that chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll go to the dump and that's where</v>

63
00:02:49.361 --> 00:02:52.930
<v Speaker 2>they find metal and they find scrap and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they take the aluminum cans and they get</v>

64
00:02:52.931 --> 00:02:54.850
<v Speaker 2>their money and they're happy to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're happy.</v>

65
00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:55.960
<v Speaker 2>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not negative.</v>

66
00:02:55.961 --> 00:02:59.890
<v Speaker 2>They're not pissed off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think part of the reason was lucky</v>

67
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.880
<v Speaker 3>is I try to put myself in a position to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get lucky,</v>

68
00:03:03.881 --> 00:03:07.420
<v Speaker 3>which is by playing more and believe it</v>
<v Speaker 3>or not,</v>

69
00:03:07.421 --> 00:03:10.090
<v Speaker 3>it's van Halen that influence that on</v>
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

70
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.500
<v Speaker 3>They were playing more than everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They played three blocks from my house</v>

71
00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:15.690
<v Speaker 3>in the backyard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now Monte,</v>

72
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.290
<v Speaker 3>I paid $1 to get in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

73
00:03:17.291 --> 00:03:21.880
<v Speaker 3>the singer Roth was blowing a tube</v>
<v Speaker 3>inside of this guy's drums.</v>

74
00:03:21.881 --> 00:03:24.130
<v Speaker 3>And I'm going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa man,</v>

75
00:03:24.131 --> 00:03:25.720
<v Speaker 3>these guys are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

76
00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.670
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought they were great and everything</v>

77
00:03:27.671 --> 00:03:29.980
<v Speaker 3>and they were playing cover songs and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they played a couple of originals I</v>

78
00:03:29.981 --> 00:03:32.830
<v Speaker 3>think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what I was more impressed by at</v>

79
00:03:32.831 --> 00:03:35.740
<v Speaker 3>least at that time was how often they</v>
<v Speaker 3>played.</v>

80
00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.100
<v Speaker 3>They played every single night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I go,</v>

81
00:03:39.101 --> 00:03:41.500
<v Speaker 3>we got to do that if we're going to have</v>
<v Speaker 3>any chance,</v>

82
00:03:41.501 --> 00:03:45.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because my thinking was if we play more</v>

83
00:03:45.401 --> 00:03:47.290
<v Speaker 3>than everybody might have to play free a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot,</v>

84
00:03:47.291 --> 00:03:49.220
<v Speaker 3>but if our name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

85
00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.030
<v Speaker 3>we might be able to brainwash people</v>
<v Speaker 3>into thinking they're supposed to like</v>

86
00:03:52.031 --> 00:03:52.864
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

87
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.520
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's what happened though.</v>

88
00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.280
<v Speaker 3>It was that persistence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was that playing free,</v>

89
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.300
<v Speaker 3>getting our name out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just happened to be at the whiskey</v>

90
00:04:04.301 --> 00:04:09.301
<v Speaker 3>one night playing at during the week,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not even a big night or anything.</v>

91
00:04:09.521 --> 00:04:12.580
<v Speaker 3>And the right guy was in the crowd that</v>
<v Speaker 3>law.</v>

92
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.260
<v Speaker 3>And he came up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gave us his card.</v>

93
00:04:14.261 --> 00:04:15.220
<v Speaker 3>And before you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

94
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.590
<v Speaker 3>we're recording,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

95
00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.470
<v Speaker 3>we got airplay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't even have a record deal.</v>

96
00:04:20.471 --> 00:04:23.800
<v Speaker 3>I mean we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our record deal was literally borrowing</v>

97
00:04:23.801 --> 00:04:27.870
<v Speaker 3>15 grand from some guy named Fred.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey Fred.</v>

98
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:28.900
<v Speaker 3>Got 15 grand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

99
00:04:28.901 --> 00:04:29.920
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

100
00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.770
<v Speaker 3>But we had a distribution deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

101
00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.000
<v Speaker 3>But this manager we had called Ellen</v>
<v Speaker 3>Devon.</v>

102
00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.730
<v Speaker 3>He was from England.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He used to work for virgin records.</v>

103
00:04:39.731 --> 00:04:44.731
<v Speaker 3>He had signed Berlin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He signed motley crew and a year before</v>

104
00:04:45.071 --> 00:04:48.880
<v Speaker 3>this and I'm the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then they would sell these bands off to</v>

105
00:04:48.881 --> 00:04:53.881
<v Speaker 3>big labels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well he got us on Camy t when we had no</v>

106
00:04:54.521 --> 00:04:59.521
<v Speaker 3>deal and no local bands were on Kamia</v>
<v Speaker 3>team Kayla West with no deal.</v>

107
00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.830
<v Speaker 3>It was just unheard of and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that,</v>

108
00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:04.850
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what kind of connection.</v>

109
00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.690
<v Speaker 2>So it was just a matter of you being</v>
<v Speaker 2>persistent and planning all the time and</v>

110
00:05:08.691 --> 00:05:12.710
<v Speaker 2>this guy saw that's such an important</v>
<v Speaker 2>lesson for young people who are thinking</v>

111
00:05:12.711 --> 00:05:14.120
<v Speaker 2>about doing something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure,</v>

112
00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.050
<v Speaker 2>Opportunity presents itself when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>just fucking buster and dream it and</v>

113
00:05:18.051 --> 00:05:19.790
<v Speaker 2>dream it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is one of the things,</v>

114
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.670
<v Speaker 2>especially talking to college students</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I love bringing up,</v>

115
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.580
<v Speaker 2>which is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm the first to admit it,</v>

116
00:05:24.581 --> 00:05:26.360
<v Speaker 2>like I have no fucking clue what I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

117
00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.420
<v Speaker 2>Ninety nine percent of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when I got started,</v>

118
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.760
<v Speaker 2>I still don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've,</v>

119
00:05:30.761 --> 00:05:34.850
<v Speaker 2>I've come to realize like I've got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got lucky enough to meet some</v>

120
00:05:34.851 --> 00:05:36.530
<v Speaker 2>pretty successful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>impressive people.</v>

121
00:05:36.531 --> 00:05:39.110
<v Speaker 2>But like you dig under the surface,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're all just hacking it.</v>

122
00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.580
<v Speaker 2>Like we're all just figure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>expertise,</v>

123
00:05:40.581 --> 00:05:43.910
<v Speaker 2>experience those things all help.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like every one of us is a fallible</v>

124
00:05:43.911 --> 00:05:44.450
<v Speaker 2>human.</v>

125
00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:48.710
<v Speaker 2>All the conventions and rules and status</v>
<v Speaker 2>quo we know were created by other</v>

126
00:05:48.711 --> 00:05:51.620
<v Speaker 2>fallible humans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's no reason not to look at</v>

127
00:05:51.621 --> 00:05:52.520
<v Speaker 2>that and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh,</v>

128
00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.800
<v Speaker 2>does it have to be that way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or why is it that way?</v>

129
00:05:54.801 --> 00:05:57.020
<v Speaker 2>And if the reason why is that's the way</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

130
00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.550
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a terrible reason,</v>

131
00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:00.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

132
00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:02.600
<v Speaker 2>and when you see the world as being that</v>
<v Speaker 2>hackable,</v>

133
00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:04.670
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you start to realize,</v>

134
00:06:04.671 --> 00:06:05.270
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well let's just,</v>

135
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.490
<v Speaker 2>let's actually question stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for,</v>

136
00:06:07.491 --> 00:06:10.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember I was a freshman at Uva when</v>

137
00:06:10.521 --> 00:06:13.400
<v Speaker 2>nine slash 11 happened for this</v>
<v Speaker 2>generation of millennials coming up.</v>

138
00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:15.080
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most nearly all of us,</v>

139
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.950
<v Speaker 2>one of our first really vivid memories</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the world was 9:11 this awful</v>

140
00:06:18.951 --> 00:06:22.130
<v Speaker 2>tragedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we get into these two wars and</v>

141
00:06:22.131 --> 00:06:25.310
<v Speaker 2>then think of all the authority figures</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've had in our life since that moment.</v>

142
00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.380
<v Speaker 2>They've all at one point another either</v>
<v Speaker 2>misled us,</v>

143
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.240
<v Speaker 2>this sort of deceive this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

144
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:32.180
<v Speaker 2>you've got the financial crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got the housing bubble,</v>

145
00:06:32.181 --> 00:06:33.590
<v Speaker 2>all these conventions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

146
00:06:33.591 --> 00:06:34.670
<v Speaker 2>trust us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know we're doing.</v>

147
00:06:34.671 --> 00:06:36.380
<v Speaker 2>This is the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the American dream is buying a home,</v>

148
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.510
<v Speaker 2>go to college,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take on that student loan debt.</v>

149
00:06:38.511 --> 00:06:40.220
<v Speaker 2>Don't worry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a job waiting for you.</v>

150
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:41.900
<v Speaker 2>Every single one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These conventions from,</v>

151
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.390
<v Speaker 2>from all these people in power have not</v>
<v Speaker 2>held up.</v>

152
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.640
<v Speaker 2>And so I think in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>millennials,</v>

153
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:48.830
<v Speaker 2>millennials look at that very</v>
<v Speaker 2>skeptically because we're like,</v>

154
00:06:48.831 --> 00:06:49.664
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

155
00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:51.980
<v Speaker 2>So the conventional stuff didn't work</v>
<v Speaker 2>out for anything.</v>

156
00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:53.710
<v Speaker 2>Like we have no choice but to realize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

157
00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:55.070
<v Speaker 2>we're all just hacking it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's,</v>

158
00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:56.960
<v Speaker 2>let's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's dive into the passion.</v>

159
00:06:56.961 --> 00:06:58.700
<v Speaker 2>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's figure out a better way to do</v>

160
00:06:58.701 --> 00:07:01.370
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Settle for the way that always been.</v>
