1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:01.540
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:02.440
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you what the problem is,</v>

3
00:00:02.441 --> 00:00:03.880
<v Speaker 1>Graham Hancock is the children.</v>

4
00:00:03.881 --> 00:00:04.211
<v Speaker 1>Where you're,</v>

5
00:00:04.211 --> 00:00:07.480
<v Speaker 1>you're ignoring is you're endorsing drug use to children.</v>

6
00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.700
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's incredibly irresponsible.</v>

7
00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:10.950
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what Ted said</v>

8
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:11.930
<v Speaker 2>when they banned my tool.</v>

9
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:13.630
<v Speaker 2>What did they,</v>

10
00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:14.341
<v Speaker 2>what did that statements,</v>

11
00:00:14.341 --> 00:00:15.080
<v Speaker 2>they said,</v>

12
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.800
<v Speaker 2>we can't allow this talk to be on the air because some young man might go off to</v>

13
00:00:19.801 --> 00:00:21.390
<v Speaker 2>South America and drink IOWASCA.</v>

14
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.470
<v Speaker 2>That's so hilarious.</v>

15
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.870
<v Speaker 2>Ted cannot be seen to be endorsing the drinking of Iowa.</v>

16
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.660
<v Speaker 1>Is that the w there was a huge issue with you.</v>

17
00:00:30.661 --> 00:00:31.201
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

18
00:00:31.201 --> 00:00:36.201
<v Speaker 1>your issue was after Eddie Wong came in here and told his gross story that makes</v>

19
00:00:36.721 --> 00:00:37.680
<v Speaker 1>you just go eat who?</v>

20
00:00:37.681 --> 00:00:38.490
<v Speaker 1>Ted.</v>

21
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.770
<v Speaker 1>Apparently John Anthony West has a 10 story as well.</v>

22
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:41.610
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

23
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.190
<v Speaker 1>and I think that there's,</v>

24
00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:45.063
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

25
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.180
<v Speaker 1>a lot of beautiful things that come out of tet.</v>

26
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.710
<v Speaker 1>A lot of incredible tools.</v>

27
00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.650
<v Speaker 1>But it seems like any organization,</v>

28
00:00:52.651 --> 00:00:57.651
<v Speaker 1>once people get into power and once people have the ability to tell other people</v>

29
00:00:57.841 --> 00:00:59.220
<v Speaker 1>what's cool and what's not cool,</v>

30
00:00:59.390 --> 00:00:59.681
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

31
00:00:59.681 --> 00:01:02.490
<v Speaker 1>It's getting weird and you start telling Eddie Wong he has to attend all these</v>

32
00:01:02.491 --> 00:01:06.360
<v Speaker 1>different things and meet all these donors and like some kind of freaky cult.</v>

33
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:07.800
<v Speaker 1>Well that's what he felt like.</v>

34
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.180
<v Speaker 1>You felt like it was really strange.</v>

35
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.230
<v Speaker 1>Now your,</v>

36
00:01:10.231 --> 00:01:15.150
<v Speaker 1>your thing got pulled and what was this scientific explanation for why they got</v>

37
00:01:15.151 --> 00:01:15.950
<v Speaker 1>pulled?</v>

38
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.260
<v Speaker 1>It was there was you,</v>

39
00:01:17.261 --> 00:01:20.880
<v Speaker 1>you had an exchange with one of the guys on Ted.</v>

40
00:01:20.881 --> 00:01:24.840
<v Speaker 1>I read the comments and you presented all the things that he had said and said,</v>

41
00:01:24.841 --> 00:01:27.060
<v Speaker 1>please show your example of when I said this,</v>

42
00:01:27.061 --> 00:01:27.811
<v Speaker 1>I never said this.</v>

43
00:01:27.811 --> 00:01:28.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

44
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:29.063
<v Speaker 1>What were the very,</v>

45
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.680
<v Speaker 1>what was the thing that he accused you of and what was the response were two of</v>

46
00:01:31.681 --> 00:01:33.840
<v Speaker 1>us who got our talks deleted Rupert Sheldrake.</v>

47
00:01:33.841 --> 00:01:34.910
<v Speaker 1>Rupert Sheldrake is the other,</v>

48
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:35.251
<v Speaker 1>his toe.</v>

49
00:01:35.251 --> 00:01:36.420
<v Speaker 1>It was called the science delusion.</v>

50
00:01:36.421 --> 00:01:36.711
<v Speaker 1>My Toe.</v>

51
00:01:36.711 --> 00:01:38.250
<v Speaker 1>It was called the war on consciousness.</v>

52
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.100
<v Speaker 1>He can't be shitting on science like the science to illusion.</v>

53
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.700
<v Speaker 1>Rupert,</v>

54
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.500
<v Speaker 1>how dare you poked it was as though</v>

55
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.560
<v Speaker 2>if it was as though Ted felt that these talks must automatically be wrong and</v>

56
00:01:48.561 --> 00:01:51.050
<v Speaker 2>that they had some kind of preconception about what we were saying.</v>

57
00:01:51.051 --> 00:01:54.710
<v Speaker 2>So they didn't even bother to sit down and listen to the actual 18 minute talks,</v>

58
00:01:54.711 --> 00:01:55.730
<v Speaker 2>not that much to listen to,</v>

59
00:01:55.731 --> 00:01:56.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

60
00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.370
<v Speaker 2>before deleting it from their youtube channel.</v>

61
00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.500
<v Speaker 2>They just said this is pseudoscience.</v>

62
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.951
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

63
00:02:00.951 --> 00:02:01.521
<v Speaker 2>it's full of,</v>

64
00:02:01.521 --> 00:02:04.580
<v Speaker 2>and they listed a series of false statements that would supposedly made,</v>

65
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:05.990
<v Speaker 2>but the problem was neither.</v>

66
00:02:05.991 --> 00:02:07.610
<v Speaker 2>I know Rupert had made those statements</v>

67
00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.170
<v Speaker 1>so they never even bothered to look at it and they just read complaints and then</v>

68
00:02:11.171 --> 00:02:12.800
<v Speaker 1>responding plotted</v>

69
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.643
<v Speaker 2>on the basis of those.</v>

70
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.760
<v Speaker 2>So when we challenged them,</v>

71
00:02:14.761 --> 00:02:15.001
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

72
00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:15.990
<v Speaker 2>please go through,</v>

73
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.681
<v Speaker 2>in my case,</v>

74
00:02:16.681 --> 00:02:17.770
<v Speaker 2>go through my talk and,</v>

75
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.960
<v Speaker 2>and find where I say that Iowasca allows you to communicate with an ancient</v>

76
00:02:24.571 --> 00:02:25.470
<v Speaker 2>mother culture.</v>

77
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:26.400
<v Speaker 2>Where do I say that?</v>

78
00:02:26.401 --> 00:02:27.810
<v Speaker 2>I never said that in my talk.</v>

79
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.850
<v Speaker 2>I never said any such thing in my talk.</v>

80
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.500
<v Speaker 2>They actually couldn't do it.</v>

81
00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:32.290
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

82
00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.720
<v Speaker 2>and something you've said before,</v>

83
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:34.200
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

84
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.033
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen,</v>

85
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.330
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen it right now.</v>

86
00:02:36.331 --> 00:02:37.164
<v Speaker 2>I heard you.</v>

87
00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.541
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

88
00:02:38.541 --> 00:02:39.374
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

89
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.260
<v Speaker 2>what I talked about was the mother goddess,</v>

90
00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.680
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

91
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.240
<v Speaker 2>The experience of an encounter with a mother,</v>

92
00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.641
<v Speaker 2>God is by,</v>

93
00:02:44.641 --> 00:02:47.940
<v Speaker 2>it never said it allows you to communicate with an ancient mother culture,</v>

94
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.440
<v Speaker 2>like a lost civilization.</v>

95
00:02:49.441 --> 00:02:51.510
<v Speaker 2>They knew I'd written books about lost civilizations,</v>

96
00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.280
<v Speaker 2>so they thought I must be bringing the,</v>

97
00:02:53.281 --> 00:02:55.590
<v Speaker 2>my lust civilization beef into the,</v>

98
00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.000
<v Speaker 2>into my ted talk,</v>

99
00:02:57.001 --> 00:02:57.430
<v Speaker 2>which I did.</v>

100
00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:58.760
<v Speaker 2>And it didn't have anything to do with lost.</v>

101
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.093
<v Speaker 2>It was a talk about,</v>

102
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.440
<v Speaker 2>talk about consciousness anyway.</v>

103
00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.081
<v Speaker 2>And the real,</v>

104
00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:05.030
<v Speaker 2>the original version was giving up the green bitch where you were talking to</v>

105
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.411
<v Speaker 2>recently.</v>

106
00:03:05.411 --> 00:03:06.630
<v Speaker 2>I originally called the talk,</v>

107
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:07.251
<v Speaker 2>giving up the green.</v>

108
00:03:07.251 --> 00:03:10.810
<v Speaker 2>That's when I watch us because I was giving my personal story of,</v>

109
00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:11.171
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

110
00:03:11.171 --> 00:03:11.950
<v Speaker 2>of uh,</v>

111
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:12.191
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

112
00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:12.700
<v Speaker 2>why I,</v>

113
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.600
<v Speaker 2>why I gave up cannabis.</v>

114
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:15.670
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

115
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.580
<v Speaker 2>I changed that title because a lot of people pointed out to me that that's</v>

116
00:03:18.581 --> 00:03:20.980
<v Speaker 2>deeply disrespectful of cannabis and that for many people,</v>

117
00:03:20.981 --> 00:03:24.520
<v Speaker 2>cannabis is a green goddess and cannabis was a green goddess for me.</v>

118
00:03:24.521 --> 00:03:25.354
<v Speaker 2>And I accepted that.</v>

119
00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:26.530
<v Speaker 2>So those people,</v>

120
00:03:26.531 --> 00:03:28.120
<v Speaker 2>I'd say fucking relax.</v>

121
00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:28.870
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

122
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.060
<v Speaker 2>Cause I love cannabis too.</v>

123
00:03:30.061 --> 00:03:31.030
<v Speaker 2>But it didn't bother me.</v>

124
00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.280
<v Speaker 2>Some people got really upset.</v>

125
00:03:33.281 --> 00:03:34.560
<v Speaker 2>I realized that to be upset,</v>

126
00:03:34.561 --> 00:03:37.510
<v Speaker 2>I realized that there is in fact a cannabis orthodoxy as well,</v>

127
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.270
<v Speaker 2>which I wish my wish by talking about my,</v>

128
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:40.780
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

129
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:41.800
<v Speaker 2>my quitting of cannabis,</v>

130
00:03:41.801 --> 00:03:43.240
<v Speaker 2>I had upset this orthodoxy.</v>

131
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.770
<v Speaker 2>But when I looked at my talk,</v>

132
00:03:44.771 --> 00:03:48.160
<v Speaker 2>my talk was much more about the war on consciousness than it was about fat.</v>

133
00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.300
<v Speaker 2>And that's what it was really about.</v>

134
00:03:49.301 --> 00:03:50.140
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

135
00:03:50.141 --> 00:03:51.820
<v Speaker 2>I made the point that,</v>

136
00:03:51.821 --> 00:03:52.420
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

137
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.020
<v Speaker 2>our society doesn't object in principle to altering consciousness.</v>

138
00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.561
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

139
00:03:56.561 --> 00:03:58.570
<v Speaker 2>what happens when you put a kid on Ritalin?</v>

140
00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:59.111
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

141
00:03:59.111 --> 00:04:01.240
<v Speaker 2>that's a powerful pharmacological drug,</v>

142
00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:03.340
<v Speaker 2>which is altering consciousness when you win,</v>

143
00:04:03.341 --> 00:04:08.341
<v Speaker 2>you over prescribed Prozac or Ciroc sat for conditions of depression that those</v>

144
00:04:09.191 --> 00:04:10.720
<v Speaker 2>drugs are altering consciousness.</v>

145
00:04:10.721 --> 00:04:11.920
<v Speaker 2>We value alcohol,</v>

146
00:04:11.921 --> 00:04:15.010
<v Speaker 2>we invest multibillion dollar alcohol industry.</v>

147
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:16.860
<v Speaker 2>People don't primarily raped,</v>

148
00:04:16.861 --> 00:04:18.130
<v Speaker 2>drink alcohol because of the taste.</v>

149
00:04:18.131 --> 00:04:21.010
<v Speaker 2>They drink it because it alters their consciousness in a way that they like.</v>

150
00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.641
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

151
00:04:21.641 --> 00:04:24.610
<v Speaker 2>and so we don't object to altering consciousness in principle,</v>

152
00:04:24.611 --> 00:04:27.160
<v Speaker 2>but we object to altering consciousness in certain kinds of ways,</v>

153
00:04:27.161 --> 00:04:29.170
<v Speaker 2>which threaten the status quo.</v>

154
00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.210
<v Speaker 2>And that's what psychedelics do.</v>

155
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.620
<v Speaker 2>They alter consciousness in ways that lead people to ask profound questions</v>

156
00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:37.990
<v Speaker 2>about the nature of the society they live in.</v>

157
00:04:37.991 --> 00:04:40.060
<v Speaker 2>And that appears to be the line that I crossed.</v>

158
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.810
<v Speaker 2>So Ted tied to try to dress it up as pseudoscience.</v>

159
00:04:43.811 --> 00:04:47.680
<v Speaker 2>And when I called them on that in the end because they realized I think that</v>

160
00:04:47.681 --> 00:04:48.070
<v Speaker 2>they were,</v>

161
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.400
<v Speaker 2>they'd got themselves into some kind of danger and it's still there on the,</v>

162
00:04:51.401 --> 00:04:53.620
<v Speaker 2>on the webpage that w Rupert and I call it,</v>

163
00:04:53.621 --> 00:04:54.580
<v Speaker 2>they're naughty corner,</v>

164
00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.910
<v Speaker 2>they created a naughty corner of the Ted website where I talked to him quick</v>

165
00:04:57.911 --> 00:05:01.150
<v Speaker 2>back on line and that with all their reasons why they'd taken them off.</v>

166
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.150
<v Speaker 2>So first thing they did was they crossed out all their reasons.</v>

167
00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:07.810
<v Speaker 2>So you can find that everything they said has actually been crossed out.</v>

168
00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.210
<v Speaker 2>And then they published our rebuttal.</v>

169
00:05:09.211 --> 00:05:10.180
<v Speaker 2>So that completely,</v>

170
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.073
<v Speaker 2>we know,</v>

171
00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:12.440
<v Speaker 2>we insisted that they,</v>

172
00:05:12.441 --> 00:05:14.710
<v Speaker 2>they accepted that nothing they'd said was true,</v>

173
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.770
<v Speaker 2>but we insisted they leave it there on the public record,</v>

174
00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:19.450
<v Speaker 2>but put a line through it.</v>

175
00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:20.170
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

176
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.510
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>

177
00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:21.350
<v Speaker 2>so that they did that.</v>

178
00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.150
<v Speaker 2>They did that.</v>

179
00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:23.200
<v Speaker 2>They did that.</v>

180
00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.860
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

181
00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:24.371
<v Speaker 2>it did that.</v>

182
00:05:24.371 --> 00:05:25.660
<v Speaker 2>And then they kind of a cool victory.</v>

183
00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:26.380
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

184
00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:26.891
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

185
00:05:26.891 --> 00:05:28.570
<v Speaker 2>And they've published our rebuttals in full,</v>

186
00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.940
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't a complete victory because what they didn't do,</v>

187
00:05:30.941 --> 00:05:34.600
<v Speaker 2>which is all we wanted was for our talks to burry reinstated on the TEDX youtube</v>

188
00:05:34.601 --> 00:05:34.970
<v Speaker 2>channel.</v>

189
00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:35.270
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

190
00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.501
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

191
00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:36.020
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

192
00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:37.000
<v Speaker 2>You can't put your tea,</v>

193
00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:38.830
<v Speaker 2>your talk online yourself.</v>

194
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.431
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

195
00:05:39.431 --> 00:05:39.791
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

196
00:05:39.791 --> 00:05:40.061
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

197
00:05:40.061 --> 00:05:42.070
<v Speaker 2>I have put my talk online myself and,</v>

198
00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.560
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

199
00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.050
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

200
00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.520
<v Speaker 2>and so have about a hundred other youtube channels.</v>

201
00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:46.510
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

202
00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:51.280
<v Speaker 2>and I think Ted took such a massive beating over this for big,</v>

203
00:05:51.281 --> 00:05:53.140
<v Speaker 2>because it clearly was an act of censorship.</v>

204
00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:53.861
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

205
00:05:53.861 --> 00:05:57.440
<v Speaker 2>they tried to dress it up that they've decided not to go and pull,</v>

206
00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:58.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

207
00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:59.330
<v Speaker 2>the talks from,</v>

208
00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:00.081
<v Speaker 2>from Youtube,</v>

209
00:06:00.081 --> 00:06:01.640
<v Speaker 2>which probably probably they could do.</v>

210
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:02.180
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

211
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.511
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

212
00:06:02.511 --> 00:06:06.800
<v Speaker 2>my talk had 132,000 views on youtube on their channel when they pulled it.</v>

213
00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:10.070
<v Speaker 2>But since then it's had hundreds of thousands of more views all over the</v>

214
00:06:10.071 --> 00:06:10.521
<v Speaker 2>internet.</v>

215
00:06:10.521 --> 00:06:10.881
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

216
00:06:10.881 --> 00:06:11.211
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

217
00:06:11.211 --> 00:06:11.661
<v Speaker 2>they the,</v>

218
00:06:11.661 --> 00:06:13.790
<v Speaker 2>rather than actually suppressed the talk,</v>

219
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:15.860
<v Speaker 2>I think it's called the Streisand effect.</v>

220
00:06:15.861 --> 00:06:16.071
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

221
00:06:16.071 --> 00:06:17.300
<v Speaker 2>rather than suppress the talks,</v>

222
00:06:17.301 --> 00:06:18.260
<v Speaker 2>they ended up multiplying.</v>

223
00:06:18.261 --> 00:06:18.501
<v Speaker 2>Same,</v>

224
00:06:18.501 --> 00:06:19.800
<v Speaker 2>but same with root cause effect.</v>

225
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.840
<v Speaker 2>Apparently.</v>

226
00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:21.673
<v Speaker 2>Apparently that,</v>

227
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:25.970
<v Speaker 2>I think it was Barbara Streisand tried to stop some public statement that had</v>

228
00:06:25.971 --> 00:06:28.550
<v Speaker 2>been made about her and it ended up multiplying the statement.</v>

229
00:06:28.551 --> 00:06:29.384
<v Speaker 2>Do you know when you try it?</v>

230
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.770
<v Speaker 2>This is the great thing about the Internet.</v>

231
00:06:30.771 --> 00:06:32.480
<v Speaker 2>When you try to suppress something,</v>

232
00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:33.613
<v Speaker 2>it grows.</v>

233
00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:35.000
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't get suppressed.</v>

234
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:35.631
<v Speaker 2>The Internet,</v>

235
00:06:35.631 --> 00:06:39.230
<v Speaker 2>including Dick Pictures and got one of those out there.</v>

236
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.420
<v Speaker 2>Come back around Graham Hancock.</v>

237
00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:42.473
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to find you.</v>

238
00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:45.020
<v Speaker 2>I've never had my dick photograph.</v>

239
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:46.100
<v Speaker 2>Congratulations.</v>

240
00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:46.963
<v Speaker 2>How about you?</v>

241
00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:49.340
<v Speaker 2>I plead the fifth</v>
