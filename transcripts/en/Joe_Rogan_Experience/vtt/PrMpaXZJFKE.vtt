00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.440
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What were some of,</v>

2
00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.560
<v Speaker 1>when you were treating patients in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>clinical pathology thing?</v>

3
00:00:08.561 --> 00:00:11.860
<v Speaker 1>Like what were some of the patterns that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you saw that were,</v>

4
00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really for some of the real challenges</v>

5
00:00:15.671 --> 00:00:17.800
<v Speaker 1>that people face?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like growing up,</v>

6
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what were the main themes that were</v>

7
00:00:19.871 --> 00:00:22.480
<v Speaker 1>the hardest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hardest to deal with and bring into a</v>

8
00:00:22.481 --> 00:00:26.050
<v Speaker 1>healthy adult life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trauma and disconnection.</v>

9
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.840
<v Speaker 1>Disconnection from like what Joe was</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying in regards to mentorship and</v>

10
00:00:31.841 --> 00:00:34.360
<v Speaker 1>having,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having a big brother or somebody in that</v>

11
00:00:34.361 --> 00:00:38.140
<v Speaker 1>role that they could aspire to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that could coach them through</v>

12
00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.170
<v Speaker 1>challenging situations and going through</v>
<v Speaker 1>trauma because trauma is so rampant and</v>

13
00:00:45.491 --> 00:00:48.190
<v Speaker 1>it's also our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our representation in our</v>

14
00:00:48.191 --> 00:00:52.360
<v Speaker 1>internalization of trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people take that on as an identity,</v>

15
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.630
<v Speaker 1>that they've been traumatized or they've</v>
<v Speaker 1>been abused and,</v>

16
00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.290
<v Speaker 1>and because it's not discussed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in fact shamed.</v>

17
00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.890
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not really dealt with above board,</v>

18
00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.680
<v Speaker 1>whether it's people being traumatized</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexually because the,</v>

19
00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.340
<v Speaker 1>the perpetrator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the person actually doing the traumatic</v>

20
00:01:09.341 --> 00:01:11.200
<v Speaker 1>event,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they weren't integrated in their own</v>

21
00:01:11.201 --> 00:01:14.050
<v Speaker 1>sexuality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it came out in a perverse way,</v>

22
00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.180
<v Speaker 1>or it was the internalization of</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that seemed mild,</v>

23
00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.350
<v Speaker 1>but because they didn't have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>languaging and the opportunity to</v>

24
00:01:23.351 --> 00:01:27.520
<v Speaker 1>connect with somebody that it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it held and seated over time.</v>

25
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.400
<v Speaker 1>Like if you see animals in the wild,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they get traumatized,</v>

26
00:01:30.401 --> 00:01:33.220
<v Speaker 1>like if you were driving a car and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>hit a deer,</v>

27
00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.610
<v Speaker 1>the first thing that deer is going to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he gets to the side of the road,</v>

28
00:01:36.611 --> 00:01:41.200
<v Speaker 1>it's going to shake it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to just move that somatically</v>

29
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.890
<v Speaker 1>out of its body because trauma gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>imprinted into the sematic</v>

30
00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.720
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on,</v>

31
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.900
<v Speaker 1>he was talking about until the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the Fascia trauma gets fat,</v>

32
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.350
<v Speaker 1>kids gets programmed into the body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it also gets trauma.</v>

33
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.440
<v Speaker 1>We'll change the genetic expression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You actually see the DNA genetic code</v>

34
00:01:59.321 --> 00:02:01.660
<v Speaker 1>change its expression at the time of</v>
<v Speaker 1>trauma.</v>

35
00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.920
<v Speaker 1>And that can be recapitulated</v>
<v Speaker 1>transgenerationally.</v>

36
00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.070
<v Speaker 1>So from generation to generation to</v>
<v Speaker 1>generation,</v>

37
00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.700
<v Speaker 1>I can still hold my parents' trauma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my granddaughters,</v>

38
00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.020
<v Speaker 1>an epigenetic phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a transgenerational epigenetic</v>

39
00:02:17.021 --> 00:02:18.670
<v Speaker 1>phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

40
00:02:18.671 --> 00:02:21.130
<v Speaker 1>So that's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so crazy.</v>

41
00:02:21.131 --> 00:02:23.290
<v Speaker 1>So we we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what the native Americans</v>

42
00:02:23.291 --> 00:02:24.220
<v Speaker 1>talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like our,</v>

43
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.090
<v Speaker 1>our actions right now do affect seven</v>
<v Speaker 1>generations down the line because it</v>

44
00:02:28.091 --> 00:02:31.990
<v Speaker 1>takes that long to bleed it out of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>jeans unless you clear it.</v>

45
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing that's weird about</v>

46
00:02:33.851 --> 00:02:36.250
<v Speaker 1>opening for bands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will tune up while you're onstage.</v>

47
00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.500
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on that level yet,</v>

48
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I work with Sherra was classy</v>

49
00:02:39.381 --> 00:02:41.810
<v Speaker 2>because she was the one that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the,</v>

50
00:02:41.811 --> 00:02:45.850
<v Speaker 2>by far the best job I ever had an</v>
<v Speaker 2>opening for anybody because she knows</v>

51
00:02:45.851 --> 00:02:48.660
<v Speaker 2>she had a great crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She had transvestites and mothers with</v>

52
00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.750
<v Speaker 2>the grandmothers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with their grandchildren,</v>

53
00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:51.920
<v Speaker 2>which is the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

54
00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.260
<v Speaker 2>You know what the security told me if</v>
<v Speaker 2>they ever saw a single straight guy</v>

55
00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.370
<v Speaker 2>alone this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any,</v>

56
00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:00.550
<v Speaker 2>he looks straight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would,</v>

57
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.250
<v Speaker 2>they would track him all night because</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

58
00:03:03.251 --> 00:03:06.070
<v Speaker 2>no guy along goes to a Cher concert of</v>
<v Speaker 2>his straight,</v>

59
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.130
<v Speaker 2>a gay guy dancing and happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No problem.</v>

60
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.520
<v Speaker 2>So if someone's going to be like a crazy</v>
<v Speaker 2>stalker,</v>

61
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.260
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be straight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>straight guy.</v>

62
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.440
<v Speaker 2>But she was fun though before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

63
00:03:16.441 --> 00:03:17.770
<v Speaker 2>You enjoyed working with her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

64
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really liked her.</v>

65
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:19.990
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever feel like a friendship with</v>
<v Speaker 2>her?</v>

66
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:21.490
<v Speaker 2>Do you contact her?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not anymore,</v>

67
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:22.200
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>

68
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.300
<v Speaker 2>she's very isolated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

69
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.010
<v Speaker 2>she's a good person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she was like,</v>

70
00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.340
<v Speaker 2>she used to ask me about the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like she wasn't really in it because she</v>

71
00:03:30.341 --> 00:03:32.500
<v Speaker 2>wasn't really in it to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what's it like?</v>

72
00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.920
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she asked me about people and one night</v>

73
00:03:35.921 --> 00:03:36.940
<v Speaker 2>we went to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

74
00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.040
<v Speaker 2>I talked her into going out in Montreal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

75
00:03:39.041 --> 00:03:40.780
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't you drop the outfits,</v>

76
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.200
<v Speaker 2>stop wearing a top hat and a cane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like maybe nobody will notice.</v>

77
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.970
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could just fix her with the fucking</v>

78
00:03:54.281 --> 00:03:57.430
<v Speaker 2>tales does lastly the dead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dead,</v>

79
00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:58.870
<v Speaker 2>skipping back and forth.</v>

80
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.660
<v Speaker 2>And she is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

81
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.160
<v Speaker 2>so we got to an ice cream place and some</v>
<v Speaker 2>like old,</v>

82
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.260
<v Speaker 2>I'd go in and look with French gut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

83
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.770
<v Speaker 2>aren't you the famous one?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's her name?</v>

84
00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:13.570
<v Speaker 2>And that's all she had to hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She goes,</v>

85
00:04:13.571 --> 00:04:14.620
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who could ever forget all,</v>

86
00:04:14.621 --> 00:04:17.710
<v Speaker 2>what's her name?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then now the validated that she can't</v>

87
00:04:17.711 --> 00:04:18.730
<v Speaker 2>go out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

88
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.700
<v Speaker 2>But one guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

89
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we had a good time.</v>

90
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.700
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we stayed with was a funny thing in the</v>

91
00:04:24.701 --> 00:04:27.100
<v Speaker 2>casino we would meet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

92
00:04:27.101 --> 00:04:30.310
<v Speaker 2>when I like in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the arenas I would do my act,</v>

93
00:04:30.311 --> 00:04:32.080
<v Speaker 2>then they'd have a break and then she'd</v>
<v Speaker 2>come up.</v>

94
00:04:32.081 --> 00:04:34.450
<v Speaker 2>So we'd never see each other except when</v>
<v Speaker 2>she had it,</v>

95
00:04:34.451 --> 00:04:36.700
<v Speaker 2>like a team prayer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then sometimes I was in that.</v>

96
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.140
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

97
00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:40.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when she's,</v>

98
00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.380
<v Speaker 2>we would cross each other one night her</v>
<v Speaker 2>grandmother and grandfather were there</v>

99
00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:46.390
<v Speaker 2>and she said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she goes,</v>

100
00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.480
<v Speaker 2>you just did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just joke with my grandparents there.</v>

101
00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:50.830
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

102
00:04:50.831 --> 00:04:53.080
<v Speaker 2>your answers out and your grandfather's</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at it.</v>

103
00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:55.600
<v Speaker 2>And she stopped the lift.</v>

104
00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.190
<v Speaker 3>I got flagged for a while where I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>pulled every time I went to Vancouver</v>

105
00:05:00.191 --> 00:05:02.440
<v Speaker 3>airport because one time I was leaving</v>
<v Speaker 3>is weird.</v>

106
00:05:02.441 --> 00:05:04.840
<v Speaker 3>My wife had got me new bag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It came with like,</v>

107
00:05:04.841 --> 00:05:06.420
<v Speaker 3>she bought me some Cologne and then it</v>
<v Speaker 3>came,</v>

108
00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:09.190
<v Speaker 3>it was a Calvin Klein bag late,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just a duffel bag that came with the</v>

109
00:05:09.191 --> 00:05:11.260
<v Speaker 3>Cologne.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I packed my stuff.</v>

110
00:05:11.261 --> 00:05:13.840
<v Speaker 3>It was like a two day trip to New York.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was when I was first doing the union,</v>

111
00:05:13.841 --> 00:05:16.780
<v Speaker 3>I was looking for Cruz and I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>interviewing producers and stuff like</v>

112
00:05:16.781 --> 00:05:20.620
<v Speaker 3>that and it was just a quick trip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then I came back and then they</v>

113
00:05:20.621 --> 00:05:22.600
<v Speaker 3>pulled me aside and then they tested my</v>
<v Speaker 3>bag and they're like,</v>

114
00:05:22.601 --> 00:05:25.690
<v Speaker 3>your bag is tested positive for cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

115
00:05:25.691 --> 00:05:26.560
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

116
00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:27.461
<v Speaker 3>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

117
00:05:27.461 --> 00:05:28.420
<v Speaker 3>show it to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

118
00:05:28.421 --> 00:05:29.210
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know.</v>

119
00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:30.250
<v Speaker 3>Understand at the time when they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

120
00:05:30.251 --> 00:05:31.570
<v Speaker 3>we found cocaine all over your bag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

121
00:05:31.571 --> 00:05:32.321
<v Speaker 3>bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me see it.</v>

122
00:05:32.321 --> 00:05:34.000
<v Speaker 3>There's no cocaine in my bag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they said,</v>

123
00:05:34.001 --> 00:05:34.180
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

124
00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.320
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we tested it.</v>

125
00:05:35.321 --> 00:05:37.750
<v Speaker 3>There's particles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would it be on there?</v>

126
00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:38.830
<v Speaker 3>Do you do cocaine?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

127
00:05:38.831 --> 00:05:40.300
<v Speaker 3>never in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not even tried it,</v>

128
00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.080
<v Speaker 3>you know like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well how is it all over your bag?</v>

129
00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:44.440
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea.</v>

130
00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.650
<v Speaker 3>And then so we went in the back for</v>
<v Speaker 3>hours and they're like,</v>

131
00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:47.081
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

132
00:05:47.081 --> 00:05:49.510

<v Speaker 3>We talked to your friend.</v>

133
00:05:49.511 --> 00:05:49.841
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

134
00:05:49.841 --> 00:05:50.980
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would have told you the same thing.</v>

135
00:05:50.981 --> 00:05:52.900
<v Speaker 3>So I was traveling with a friend and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>

136
00:05:52.901 --> 00:05:54.660
<v Speaker 3>he would have told you the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good cop,</v>

137
00:05:54.661 --> 00:05:55.260
<v Speaker 3>bad cop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

138
00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:56.740
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

139
00:05:56.741 --> 00:05:58.410
<v Speaker 3>he told the drill and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>

140
00:05:59.060 --> 00:05:59.351
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

141
00:05:59.351 --> 00:06:01.520
<v Speaker 3>We went to New York,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're looking at developing a</v>

142
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.880
<v Speaker 3>documentary and then it finally came</v>
<v Speaker 3>down to where I said,</v>

143
00:06:04.881 --> 00:06:06.530
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like tell me how this particle thing</v>

144
00:06:06.531 --> 00:06:08.330
<v Speaker 3>works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I did the night deposit for my</v>

145
00:06:08.331 --> 00:06:09.980
<v Speaker 3>nightclub the night before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

146
00:06:09.981 --> 00:06:13.370
<v Speaker 3>And they say a large majority of money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially in nightclubs and stuff.</v>

147
00:06:13.371 --> 00:06:14.300
<v Speaker 3>I asked cocaine on it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

148
00:06:14.301 --> 00:06:16.940
<v Speaker 3>People do a rail wipe their hand grabbed</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bill,</v>

149
00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.120
<v Speaker 3>and I'd done the cash deposit for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>nightclub right before our flight.</v>

150
00:06:20.121 --> 00:06:22.700
<v Speaker 3>I'd put it in that bag,</v>
<v Speaker 3>went to the night deposit,</v>

151
00:06:22.701 --> 00:06:24.830
<v Speaker 3>put it in the bank,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I flew out to like six or seven</v>

152
00:06:24.831 --> 00:06:26.300
<v Speaker 3>in the morning and like pack my gear</v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of,</v>

153
00:06:26.301 --> 00:06:29.690
<v Speaker 3>so I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could it be that like cocaine was on the</v>

154
00:06:29.691 --> 00:06:31.340
<v Speaker 3>money that was in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my bag that,</v>

155
00:06:31.341 --> 00:06:32.540
<v Speaker 3>and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

156
00:06:32.541 --> 00:06:34.060
<v Speaker 3>we can trace particles like that.</v>

157
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:35.360
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well then there's your answer.</v>

158
00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:39.370
<v Speaker 3>But then they looked at my club strip</v>
<v Speaker 3>club Cheetahs this night and then there,</v>

159
00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.930
<v Speaker 3>then it was just like we were in there</v>
<v Speaker 3>longer and I was like,</v>

160
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.570
<v Speaker 3>ah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So every time I came back and here's the</v>

161
00:06:44.571 --> 00:06:47.480
<v Speaker 3>interesting thing is every time I came</v>
<v Speaker 3>back to Vancouver they flagged,</v>

162
00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.400
<v Speaker 3>they'd pull me aside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pulled me and finally I was so mad.</v>

163
00:06:49.401 --> 00:06:50.570
<v Speaker 3>I was like one in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

164
00:06:50.571 --> 00:06:52.430
<v Speaker 3>please just don't pull me aside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm so tired.</v>

165
00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:55.220
<v Speaker 3>I got to drive to the outskirts of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vancouver to stay at my buddy's place.</v>

166
00:06:55.221 --> 00:06:58.490
<v Speaker 3>I just want to go to bed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>please go to the side.</v>

167
00:06:58.491 --> 00:06:59.990
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I was so mad.</v>

168
00:06:59.991 --> 00:07:02.420
<v Speaker 3>I just laid on their metal counter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was tired neck cause you know they do</v>

169
00:07:02.421 --> 00:07:04.760
<v Speaker 3>the thing where they put you over there</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then nobody comes for like half</v>

170
00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:05.870
<v Speaker 3>hour,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just make you sit there.</v>

171
00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:07.490
<v Speaker 3>So I just laid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started napping.</v>

172
00:07:07.491 --> 00:07:08.960
<v Speaker 3>It was exhausted like one 30 in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>morning,</v>

173
00:07:08.961 --> 00:07:11.600
<v Speaker 3>coming back from New York.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I laid up there and the girl comes to</v>

174
00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:12.560
<v Speaker 3>get down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

175
00:07:12.561 --> 00:07:13.820
<v Speaker 3>I'm tired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one 30 in the morning,</v>

176
00:07:13.821 --> 00:07:17.570
<v Speaker 3>I'm really tired and I'm not playing any</v>
<v Speaker 3>games like she and I finally just said,</v>

177
00:07:17.571 --> 00:07:18.980
<v Speaker 3>why am I getting pulled over all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>time?</v>

178
00:07:18.981 --> 00:07:20.600
<v Speaker 3>I've never broken a law.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't like,</v>

179
00:07:20.601 --> 00:07:23.180
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing every check your thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never done anything.</v>

180
00:07:23.181 --> 00:07:25.130
<v Speaker 3>I've never brought over items that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't,</v>

181
00:07:25.131 --> 00:07:26.780
<v Speaker 3>I haven't meet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she's like,</v>

182
00:07:26.781 --> 00:07:28.670
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the big problem is is that one time your</v>

183
00:07:28.671 --> 00:07:29.660
<v Speaker 3>bag got test.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

184
00:07:29.661 --> 00:07:31.370
<v Speaker 3>I explained that and that should all be</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the notes,</v>

185
00:07:31.371 --> 00:07:32.151
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She said,</v>

186
00:07:32.151 --> 00:07:34.550
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we always don't trust it when you</v>

187
00:07:34.551 --> 00:07:38.390
<v Speaker 3>say you don't do the product right and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all over your bag because then we</v>

188
00:07:38.391 --> 00:07:39.350
<v Speaker 3>think you're a smuggler.</v>

189
00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:41.630
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're almost better to just say,</v>

190
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:43.730
<v Speaker 3>Yup,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did some cocaine with friends or</v>

191
00:07:43.731 --> 00:07:45.770
<v Speaker 3>whatever and we don't have any on me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

192
00:07:45.771 --> 00:07:46.880
<v Speaker 3>but I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't do it.</v>

193
00:07:46.881 --> 00:07:48.380
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to say I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she's like,</v>

194
00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:50.120
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why they think you're maybe a</v>

195
00:07:50.121 --> 00:07:52.370
<v Speaker 3>smuggler.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're doing quick trips to New York.</v>

196
00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:54.590
<v Speaker 3>It's on your bag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

197
00:07:54.591 --> 00:07:57.320
<v Speaker 3>it's like the guy who got in trouble for</v>
<v Speaker 3>structuring</v>

198
00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:01.150
<v Speaker 3>you did it similar to what it is we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to take.</v>

199
00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:06.140
<v Speaker 3>Your money was just cash.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have a bunch of different</v>

200
00:08:06.141 --> 00:08:10.220
<v Speaker 3>techniques that they teach these</v>
<v Speaker 3>knuckleheads to try to like recognize</v>

201
00:08:10.221 --> 00:08:13.100
<v Speaker 3>shady people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they like think they're fucking</v>

202
00:08:13.101 --> 00:08:15.150
<v Speaker 3>spies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like think they're detectives</v>

203
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:19.010
<v Speaker 3>staring at everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that Jamie Bern and look at his</v>

204
00:08:19.011 --> 00:08:21.760
<v Speaker 3>face,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw a deceptive tips.</v>

205
00:08:21.761 --> 00:08:23.810
<v Speaker 3>Her and I immediately pulled out of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>line.</v>

206
00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.270
<v Speaker 3>I actually got the guy really pissed off</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it,</v>

207
00:08:26.271 --> 00:08:28.190
<v Speaker 3>cause I used to get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these were the Canadian guys and I'm a</v>

208
00:08:28.191 --> 00:08:28.971
<v Speaker 3>Canadian stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I was like,</v>

209
00:08:28.971 --> 00:08:31.640
<v Speaker 3>you can't kick me out of my own country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I battle with them a little bit</v>

210
00:08:31.641 --> 00:08:32.420
<v Speaker 3>harder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

211
00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:33.470
<v Speaker 3>And the one guy asked me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

212
00:08:33.471 --> 00:08:35.450
<v Speaker 3>have you ever done a narcotic?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

213
00:08:35.451 --> 00:08:36.201
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>never done it.</v>

214
00:08:36.201 --> 00:08:36.711
<v Speaker 3>Narcotic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

215
00:08:36.711 --> 00:08:37.850
<v Speaker 3>if you never smoked weed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

216
00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:40.550
<v Speaker 3>that's not a narcotic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Narcotic comes from the Latin word,</v>

217
00:08:40.551 --> 00:08:42.530
<v Speaker 3>meaning narcosis causing asleep and do</v>
<v Speaker 3>state,</v>

218
00:08:42.531 --> 00:08:45.110
<v Speaker 3>which is usually applied to opiates and</v>
<v Speaker 3>heroin and stuff like that.</v>

219
00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:46.363
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

220
00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.650
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>marijuana is a psycho tropical drawing.</v>

221
00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:51.410
<v Speaker 3>I think he was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you psycho tropic,</v>

222
00:08:51.411 --> 00:08:52.790
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a tropical.</v>

223
00:08:52.791 --> 00:08:54.080
<v Speaker 3>It's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's part of the world.</v>

224
00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:55.010
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

225
00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:57.210
<v Speaker 3>and he was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's not get to the nitty gritty.</v>

226
00:08:57.211 --> 00:08:57.601
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

227
00:08:57.601 --> 00:08:58.080
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

228
00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.300
<v Speaker 3>You're a border guard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're asking me questions.</v>

229
00:09:00.301 --> 00:09:02.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm answering honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you're going to ask me questions,</v>

230
00:09:02.611 --> 00:09:05.130
<v Speaker 3>you make sure you answered that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You asked me the right one and I will</v>

231
00:09:05.131 --> 00:09:06.840
<v Speaker 3>give you the correct answer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was like,</v>

232
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:10.740
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>
