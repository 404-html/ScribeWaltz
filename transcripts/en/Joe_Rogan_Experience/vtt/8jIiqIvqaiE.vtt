1
00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:07.150
Hi everybody.
Oh,

2
00:00:07.151 --> 00:00:11.680
562 people.
Is this thing on?
Yeah,
I think I need to turn it up.

3
00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.620
Turn on your hot line.
I don't know where it is.
Right.

4
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.010
<v 2>Definitely not the top.
The ones on the very left,
the two on the left toes,</v>

5
00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.590
all of them sit over here.
Is that Ooh,
yeah,
that shit or that's glorious.

6
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.720
Oh the volume.
Your ears cleaned out yet.
No,

7
00:00:29.721 --> 00:00:31.040
I did not.
I did not.

8
00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.760
I do want to and I do believe you and I'm going to do it.

9
00:00:34.761 --> 00:00:38.270
I promise I'm going to try it myself.
I'm gonna order some shit online.

10
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.070
I just found some,
some rhino bottle and there's an elephant one in a rhino one.

11
00:00:43.071 --> 00:00:45.290
I heard about that.
Yeah.
And the apparently you can do it.

12
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.830
It's exactly the same as the people doing the off cause it's a squeeze bottle.

13
00:00:48.831 --> 00:00:51.460
Like a spray bottle you spray a cat with or something like that.

14
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.490
And this is like a high powered waterpik year.
Maybe.
You're right.
Yeah,

15
00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.300
but you could buy that.
Like I told her,
I'm like,
I can I buy that.
And she's like,

16
00:00:59.301 --> 00:01:01.640
no,
it's for professional use only.
And I'm thinking,
yeah,

17
00:01:01.641 --> 00:01:03.540
but that means I could still buy.
You could buy it off.

18
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.730
It's fucking wild world out there folks.
Apparently.
Well,

19
00:01:07.731 --> 00:01:11.060
let's talk about this in the podcast because I do want to bring up this a new

20
00:01:11.061 --> 00:01:15.110
thing that's been going on where people are selling illegal drugs over the

21
00:01:15.111 --> 00:01:17.000
internet and getting away with it.
Somehow or another.

22
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.020
You heard of this changing a module?
My,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Not even that.

23
00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.070
<v 1>Well,
we'll,
we'll,
we'll get into that,
but before we get into anything,</v>

24
00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.820
we have commercials.
We have a very fucking flawed model,
ladies and gentlemen,

25
00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.250
of how we handle these things.
We don't know.

26
00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.040
We don't operate in a very professional manner and a,

27
00:01:33.041 --> 00:01:36.190
I don't know if it's good or bad,
but at least you know what the fuck is up.

28
00:01:36.191 --> 00:01:39.700
There's no producers behind the scenes directing Brian and I to be better at

29
00:01:39.701 --> 00:01:44.170
this.
So,
um,
it's not happening.
Um,

30
00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.700
on at.com is our sponsor.

31
00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.750
That's our number one only real fucking serious sponsor.

32
00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.860
Occasionally we have other sponsors,
but a on it is,
uh,

33
00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.380
the number one thing right now.
O.
N N I t what is on it?

34
00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:01.410
It is a company that w the whole mission of the company is to bring you the best

35
00:02:02.351 --> 00:02:05.850
supplements,
the best fitness equipment,
the Beth,

36
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.550
the best choices for a healthy lifestyle.

37
00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.650
And what Alpha brain is it is,
uh,
it's,
it's nootropics and what they are,

38
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.570
the vitamins that have been shown to have a positive effect on cognitive

39
00:02:19.571 --> 00:02:22.750
function to have a positive effect on how your brain operates.

40
00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.970
I take them every day.
I swear by him as do I swear by Shroom Tech Sport,

41
00:02:27.971 --> 00:02:31.180
which is a fucking phenomenal,
um,
Supplement.

42
00:02:31.181 --> 00:02:35.770
We got to give Jamie Kilstein son before he goes enrolls fucking stuff is

43
00:02:35.771 --> 00:02:39.040
tremendous.
It's,
it's an amazing,
it's based on the quarter steps mushroom,

44
00:02:39.041 --> 00:02:44.020
which has been shown to accentuate your,
your body's ability to process oxygen.

45
00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.370
I'm not sure how it works,

46
00:02:45.371 --> 00:02:50.371
but it was discovered apparently by high altitude herders who their animals,

47
00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.480
they noticed after eating these mushrooms would have more pep to them.

48
00:02:54.481 --> 00:02:59.310
And apparently it's grown off of a fucking caterpillar.
It's very complicated.
Uh,

49
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.100
but,
uh,
there's

50
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.470
<v 3>uh,
you know,
like what people are able to do today,</v>

51
00:03:02.471 --> 00:03:07.180
like harvesting live organisms,
like acid off the list and,
and,

52
00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.150
and different mushrooms and things like is it really kind of fascinating,

53
00:03:10.151 --> 00:03:13.840
but the way they have to do this quarter zips mushroom is particularly difficult

54
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.830
but very worth it for athletes.
And it's not something that's illegal either.

55
00:03:17.831 --> 00:03:21.100
It's not something where you're going to piss hot if you want to wins the

56
00:03:21.101 --> 00:03:23.500
Olympics.
You know what I'm saying?
So you have to worry about it.

57
00:03:23.501 --> 00:03:26.170
It's not any hooker.
They're not like steroids or anything,

58
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.310
but it is very effective as is this new hemp force protein that we just got.

59
00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.540
This is the highest quality plant based protein you can buy.

60
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.790
And we have to get it from Canada,
unfortunately,

61
00:03:36.791 --> 00:03:41.620
because we have a retarded governor man and are retarded government,

62
00:03:41.621 --> 00:03:42.280
believe it or not,

63
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.600
even though it's legal in Vermont and I believe in two other states,

64
00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:48.520
but most certainly Vermont,
they were the pioneers.

65
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.750
They made it illegal to grow hemp in the state of Vermont.
Well,
why is that?

66
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.770
Because hemp is not psychoactive.
You can't get high from it.

67
00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.660
You will not test positive for THC.

68
00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.440
Did you know that if you eat poppy seed bagels that you can test positive for

69
00:04:02.441 --> 00:04:06.490
heroin?
Yeah.
That's how crazy this world is.
So you can't,

70
00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.070
that does not happen with hamp.
If you eat the hemp fiber,

71
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.960
you do not get any THC in your system.

72
00:04:10.961 --> 00:04:13.060
You've seen not going to test positive for marijuana,

73
00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.890
but it is a really easily digestible form of protein.

74
00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.020
And the stuff that we got is hemp hearts.

75
00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.310
It is the highest quality stuff available.
It's not cheap.
It's expensive.

76
00:04:24.311 --> 00:04:25.001
It's hard to get.

77
00:04:25.001 --> 00:04:28.660
And the reason why is because our government is filled with clients.
That's it.

78
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.840
But it is a really effective plant based

79
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.390
protein and it also has maca in it and it also has raw cocoa.

80
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.530
It's really delicious too cause there's,

81
00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:44.640
there's only one gram of sugar per serving and it is a sweetened by Stevia

82
00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.450
instead.
And Stevia is a really,

83
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.170
really potent natural sweetener.
It's kind of a different flavor.

84
00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.010
And to have the Stevia mixed with the raw cocoa in the hemp,

85
00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.050
it's fucking delicious.

86
00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:02.230
It is my all time favorite tasting protein powder.

87
00:05:02.231 --> 00:05:04.090
This shit is fucking phenomenal.

88
00:05:04.091 --> 00:05:07.030
I have to fight myself to keep myself from to drink in three of these a day

89
00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.890
cause I've run through my equipment sun.
We also have a,
anyway,

90
00:05:11.891 --> 00:05:14.260
we have a money back guarantee.
When you're ordering supplements,

91
00:05:14.261 --> 00:05:19.261
if you ordered Alpha brain or shroom tech sport or shroom tech immune 31st 30

92
00:05:19.511 --> 00:05:21.130
pills,
there's a hundred percent money back guarantee.

93
00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.780
You don't even have to send back the product.

94
00:05:22.781 --> 00:05:24.280
We don't anybody to feel ripped off.

95
00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.070
We're only selling you the best shit available.

96
00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.880
We're only selling you shit that has been proven in some studies to have some

97
00:05:30.881 --> 00:05:35.710
effect on human behavior,
human body,
the human athletic function.

98
00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:40.370
Everything that we have is shit that we believe in 100% and uh,
no.

99
00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:43.240
Nobody wants anybody to feel ripped off.
So we're selling you great shit.

100
00:05:43.241 --> 00:05:44.620
The Best Shit that we can get our hands on.

101
00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.560
We also have kettle bells and battle ropes available.

102
00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:48.850
If you have never done those,

103
00:05:48.851 --> 00:05:53.110
they're fucking tremendous real man type exercises.

104
00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:55.870
Battle ropes are goddamn brutal.

105
00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.660
You would never think throwing some ropes from would be so fucking hard,
man.

106
00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.770
But I get out there and wail on those motherfuckers for 30 seconds and they'd

107
00:06:03.771 --> 00:06:08.060
take 20 seconds off and wait on him for 30 seconds.
Holy Shit.

108
00:06:08.061 --> 00:06:11.990
Is that a workout between battles?
This is,
this is,
I think all you need.

109
00:06:11.991 --> 00:06:13.370
If you want to get in shape like all the,

110
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.820
there's a lot of people that join exercise gyms and you wind up doing stair

111
00:06:17.821 --> 00:06:20.220
masters and you wind up doing,
you know,

112
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.870
leg extensions and all this crazy shit you do on machines.

113
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:25.940
This is all you need for fitness.
Okay?

114
00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:31.160
Bodyweight squats are fucking fantastic.
Okay?
That's one body weight squats,

115
00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:34.640
Chin ups,
do a lot of chips.
How many chips can you really fucking do?

116
00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:39.500
Go after the way down.
All the way down.
Go after it.
Okay.

117
00:06:39.501 --> 00:06:43.760
Just that alone will make you ridiculously strong doing a fuck load of chin-ups.

118
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:48.050
Okay.
It's a natural body weight movement and kettle bells.

119
00:06:48.051 --> 00:06:52.010
And what's great about kettlebells is for there,
these cannonballs with handles.

120
00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:52.670
Huh?

121
00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:56.990
And they're fucking awkward as Shit and you're swinging them around and you're

122
00:06:56.991 --> 00:07:01.991
forcing your body to control and bounce this giant ass cannon ball.

123
00:07:02.211 --> 00:07:03.740
And when you do that,
whether you're doing it,
I'm,

124
00:07:03.741 --> 00:07:05.180
sometimes I do them with two hands.

125
00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:08.410
I have certain exercises that I do with two hands that are fucking brutal.

126
00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:13.420
I'll take two 70 pounders and do this just ridiculous assault on your body and

127
00:07:13.671 --> 00:07:18.050
you can't do it for more than 30 or 40 seconds.
But I do these 42nd reps with it.

128
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:20.420
It's what it is.
It's a,
it's cleans,

129
00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:25.010
press a squat and then I swing it down,
cleans,
press,
squat,

130
00:07:25.011 --> 00:07:29.360
and I do it the whole thing in a series.
And I do this,
this series,

131
00:07:29.361 --> 00:07:34.160
like I try to do 20 reps nice.
And when I get to 20 reps,
it's staff.

132
00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:39.050
It's fucking death.
You're swinging 140 pounds,
pressing it up,

133
00:07:39.051 --> 00:07:43.220
holding in each hand.
I mean it is made me substantially stronger,

134
00:07:43.221 --> 00:07:47.690
really increase my Jujitsu game,
made position stronger.

135
00:07:47.691 --> 00:07:51.800
I have better balance.
I can,
I can have more.

136
00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:56.630
I have more control.
I have more sovereignty over my balance.

137
00:07:56.631 --> 00:08:01.200
I can move my body more the way I want to be.
Grim.
Yeah,
and that's what I ended.

138
00:08:01.201 --> 00:08:04.430
The grip is tremendous too because they're heavy as shit and you're handing hell

139
00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:06.860
holding onto this fat iron handle.

140
00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.830
These kettlebells are as cheap as we can sell them.

141
00:08:09.831 --> 00:08:11.630
They are the highest quality available there,

142
00:08:11.631 --> 00:08:15.620
Troy kettlebells and if you fucking buy these things,

143
00:08:15.621 --> 00:08:17.750
they will last until past the apocalypse.

144
00:08:17.751 --> 00:08:22.280
They will last the when when the ice caps melt and this whole thing is covered

145
00:08:22.281 --> 00:08:22.671
in water.

146
00:08:22.671 --> 00:08:25.520
They will find these fucking kettle bells at the bottom of the ocean and try to

147
00:08:25.521 --> 00:08:28.370
figure out what the hell they were all about.
Fuck your leg extensions.

148
00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:31.910
Know you don't need leg extension son.
Do some body weight squats or by the way,

149
00:08:31.911 --> 00:08:35.960
do some one arm pistols while holding a fucking 35 pound kettle bell.

150
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:37.130
Let me see if you could do that.

151
00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:41.060
Do some one legged squats while holding a 35 pound cat about how many of those

152
00:08:41.061 --> 00:08:43.490
can you do?
Bitch,
that shit is hard.
Okay.

153
00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:48.760
Tremendous exercise as far as its ability to translate into athletics and

154
00:08:49.221 --> 00:08:51.680
that's,
that's what I think is very important for me at least.

155
00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:54.560
There's a lot of exercises that they make.
You look a little bit better,

156
00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:57.300
but they don't really,
you're,
your body's not moving in a natural way.

157
00:08:57.301 --> 00:08:59.250
You're isolating things and when you do that,

158
00:08:59.251 --> 00:09:03.390
you can actually throw off the whole balance of how your body communicates and

159
00:09:03.391 --> 00:09:07.440
now it's weight.
That's why dudes with meatball bodies meatballs on a toothpick.

160
00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:10.840
We really big upper body,
a little skinny legs.
Those guys aren't athletes.

161
00:09:10.841 --> 00:09:14.040
That's ridiculous.
You can't move like that.
Stupid Ladies and gentlemen.

162
00:09:14.041 --> 00:09:17.500
I see end of this God damn commercial.
Oh righty.
Cue The music.
Music,

163
00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:21.360
coast name and Rogan codes use.
I need a producer.

164
00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:25.020
You use a codename Rogan and a,
you get 10% off.
All right.
Dirty bitches,

165
00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:26.250
all supplements.

166
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:30.980
<v 4>Jamie kill scenes here.</v>

167
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:40.620
Nothing.
What happened there?
I do it a little different.

168
00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:44.220
It is a non faith.
Just fucking kill it.
Yeah,

169
00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:46.470
you got to give up on just trying to outdo yourself.

170
00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:49.610
There's certain things in life you got to accept and you've got to accept that.

171
00:09:49.611 --> 00:09:52.770
You can't make that song any better than it is.
I'm mixing it up.
Okay.

172
00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:55.920
Can I say something about your sponsors real quick?
Sure.
Uh,

173
00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:58.170
if the government were ever to investigate you,

174
00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.460
your sponsors or evidence that you are trying to start an army for like when

175
00:10:01.461 --> 00:10:02.880
shit goes out.
Cause like,
yeah,

176
00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:06.630
like I've never heard a show like I'm used to like,
I remember like the old,

177
00:10:06.631 --> 00:10:11.070
like the flashlights are people advertising.
Condoms are fucking bud light.

178
00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:15.900
But it's like you need these to make you strong for when you know what happens.

179
00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:19.440
But when the shit goes down and you got choke some fucking soldiers and fucking

180
00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:22.240
kettlebells,
I've never heard a shit.
I'll be sponsored by fucking kettle.

181
00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:28.460
Well,
um,
I want to be sponsored by Shit,
I believe in man,
which is a,

182
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:32.130
<v 3>so why are we have these Alienware computers?
The only one where we,
uh,</v>

183
00:10:32.131 --> 00:10:34.380
support them because they support a MMA fighters.

184
00:10:34.381 --> 00:10:37.350
They're always sponsoring fighters.
Every UFC show I go to,

185
00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:39.390
I see dudes with that alien ware logo on it.

186
00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:43.010
And I love that and I love that Dell has the balls to uh,

187
00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:48.000
to step up and sponsor a very controversial but a very noble sport.
And so,
uh,

188
00:10:48.001 --> 00:10:50.880
I appreciate that.
So we use Alienware because of that.

189
00:10:50.881 --> 00:10:54.420
So I try to keep this show as,
you know,

190
00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:58.370
you never going to see Brian and I advertise something that we don't believe in

191
00:10:58.371 --> 00:11:02.010
it.
That it's something that sucks like this.
Like even this Alienware thing.

192
00:11:02.011 --> 00:11:06.510
I would say that if you're like a regular dude and you don't game,
this is crazy.

193
00:11:06.511 --> 00:11:09.390
This thing is a fucking brick look at the size of this guy damn thing.

194
00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:12.690
But if you wanted to a game on it,
this is the shit.
I mean,

195
00:11:12.691 --> 00:11:16.530
this thing is just like you could do,
you could play at high resolution,

196
00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:20.670
like really dope high frame rate.
Oh yeah,
he played for three days.

197
00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:22.880
It's already much having the best as Xbox play,

198
00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:26.880
playstation three and everything in a laptop.
But if you're not a Gamer,

199
00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:28.260
then that's overkill.

200
00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:32.630
<v 4>Oh wait,
like 80 pounds.
Hypothetically when you're dying.
The kettlebell lane,</v>

201
00:11:32.631 --> 00:11:34.820
it's really good for like hacking into the CIA.

202
00:11:34.821 --> 00:11:38.210
I don't know if that goes down and tracing their steps.

203
00:11:38.211 --> 00:11:42.470
So you can always be one step ahead of them that are full CPU and some hacker

204
00:11:42.471 --> 00:11:45.290
skills and you need to be able to run Linux.
Okay.
What'd you,

205
00:11:45.291 --> 00:11:49.220
we are also sponsored by sponsored by Linux.
We're sponsored by open source.

206
00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:50.900
Listen,
I would,
I would love,

207
00:11:50.901 --> 00:11:54.220
I believe in open source 100% believe in Unix and Linux

208
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:54.761
<v 3>and all that stuff.</v>

209
00:11:54.761 --> 00:11:59.350
But I think that ultimately people want a little bit better of a user

210
00:11:59.351 --> 00:12:03.130
experience.
We want to be able to go and buy everything and you know,

211
00:12:03.131 --> 00:12:05.980
you don't want like some thing we've got to use Mike's Browser and you're like,

212
00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:08.530
oh,
what does this mix browser,
you know what I mean?

213
00:12:08.531 --> 00:12:12.340
And we see some of the browsers that people use and right now dorks are going

214
00:12:12.341 --> 00:12:12.990
crazy.

215
00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:14.940
<v 5>You don't know what you're talking about.
Rogen,</v>

216
00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:19.620
you would access a wide variety of browsers that are available.
High Code,

217
00:12:19.621 --> 00:12:20.640
my own,

218
00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:24.210
<v 3>all the heat is off me now.
That's great.
Fucking people do it.</v>

219
00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:27.670
People have gotten angry at Brian and here's one of my favorite fucking

220
00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:28.533
arguments.

221
00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:32.050
Oh dude was angry at Brian because we were talking about android phones.

222
00:12:32.051 --> 00:12:34.990
And I always look at android phones and I look at him and like,
Woo,

223
00:12:34.991 --> 00:12:38.620
that's how fucking pig screen that looks so pretty.
And then Brian was like,
yeah,

224
00:12:38.621 --> 00:12:40.270
there's still clunky.
They're kind of funky

225
00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:44.270
<v 5>guy argued you don't even know what you're talking about.</v>

226
00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:47.300
Maybe the regular unit user interface is Clunky,

227
00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:51.500
but I've hacked into my droid and I've,
you know,
used a different,

228
00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:56.670
whatever the fuck they call them.
I've rooted it and use a different ls.
They,

229
00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:57.380
they,
they,
they,

230
00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:01.370
they impact the operating system changed the way it looks and they go,
see,

231
00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:07.430
<v 2>I have to admit something as girl I know just got the Samsung Galaxy s three and</v>

232
00:13:07.431 --> 00:13:12.040
I,
yeah.
And I started playing with,
and I,
it's not the sh the design is the shit,

233
00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:15.260
like,
like,
like big and she was lat and I just want to,

234
00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:18.680
I want to have my apple on it though,
you know?
Right.
But I,

235
00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:20.930
so I started using the [inaudible] system.
It was kind of cool.

236
00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:24.200
There was a lot of cool little like fun features like that.

237
00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.110
Like to take a screenshot,
you just wipe your whole hand across the screen.

238
00:13:27.111 --> 00:13:30.120
I was like,
that's kind of cool,
you know,
things like that.
But then I'm like,
uh,

239
00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:32.890
uh,
Africa,
what?
I think it was Facebook,
I started using Facebook.

240
00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:35.870
Let me just try your Facebook APP.
And then it froze.
And I was like,
all right,

241
00:13:35.871 --> 00:13:38.900
fuck this.
All right,
so let's go to the camera.
So then I'm taking the camera,

242
00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:42.080
I'm trying to take a camera and it's like lagging,
like behind.
I'm just like,

243
00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.510
fuck this shit.
You know,
they didn't under it.
That was like,

244
00:13:44.511 --> 00:13:47.300
there it is right there to be a really good camera.

245
00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:50.780
This is one of the things that's been,
well maybe she needed to reboot it,

246
00:13:50.781 --> 00:13:55.400
but still the design of it,
I was so fucking like jealous about like,

247
00:13:55.401 --> 00:13:57.220
I need it.
Like I want to

248
00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:00.220
<v 3>browser.
That's what,
what I'm looking at it for is like,</v>

249
00:14:00.221 --> 00:14:03.310
I like to get online from an airport or something like that and look at it like

250
00:14:03.311 --> 00:14:05.500
things real quick,
you know,
like go to MMA dot.

251
00:14:05.501 --> 00:14:07.750
TV or mixed martial arts or calm or something like that.
Um,

252
00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:11.160
you can't see shit on an iPhone.
It's tiny going to scrawl.
Yes.

253
00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:15.060
Stretch it out and just drink it up if you want to really see a picture.
Yeah.

254
00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:18.340
But on these galaxies,
first of all,
the thing is the,
um,

255
00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:21.220
the four g is just fucking better.
It's just better.
I,
I,

256
00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:24.940
the iPhone wants to get silly and say that a,
we're almost like four g.

257
00:14:24.941 --> 00:14:27.700
If you have 18 and t pretty fucking facets.
It's pretty fast.

258
00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:31.000
I don't have 18 t though.
I have a,
I have Verizon,

259
00:14:31.001 --> 00:14:33.310
so it's like I'm using old shit.
I've,
I've,
I've,

260
00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:37.990
I have a card in my laptop that's a four g card.
It's fucking dope,
man.

261
00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:42.210
You just,
you,
it blows things up like that.
It's incredible.
It's really good.

262
00:14:42.211 --> 00:14:44.410
And like,
you can watch youtube videos with no lag.

263
00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:47.500
You starting them up and they play no problem.
It's really good.

264
00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:51.050
But it just makes me realize how stupid the Internet is on my phone.
You know?

265
00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:53.990
That's where,
that's one of the big reasons.
Got To hack into a better internet,

266
00:14:53.991 --> 00:14:56.960
bro.
Yeah,
Bro,
you got to fucking learn headache.
Can you,
your kernel,

267
00:14:57.030 --> 00:15:00.320
there's not say brow crowded.
Those two characters that they might,

268
00:15:00.321 --> 00:15:01.220
if they're growing up,

269
00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.720
they're growing past their current stage of nerdom.

270
00:15:05.721 --> 00:15:09.920
They're experimenting with new words.
It's son,
listen bro,
Bro.
Dude,

271
00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:13.340
man,
come on man.
How can this system,
bro,
how can system bro,

272
00:15:13.341 --> 00:15:14.780
you can make your iPhone four g.

273
00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:17.340
<v 2>What's really crazy as the apple TVs,</v>

274
00:15:17.341 --> 00:15:21.210
there's a new version of apple TV that's now 10 80 p but the one before it,

275
00:15:21.211 --> 00:15:26.211
the 7:20 PM you could hack into and they have like this great thing where you

276
00:15:26.671 --> 00:15:29.260
just sit there and have like every single movie that's like a,

277
00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:33.750
in the theaters right now it's just like imagine apple I TV.

278
00:15:33.751 --> 00:15:36.060
But if it's like every single movie possible,

279
00:15:36.061 --> 00:15:39.380
every single day you can sit there and watch like direct TV,
either watch,

280
00:15:39.381 --> 00:15:40.500
like UFC,

281
00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:45.060
like you can pretty much watch everything and it's pretty bad ass.
They had at,

282
00:15:45.061 --> 00:15:48.240
at this barber shop in Atlanta when we were in Atlanta at last and I was just

283
00:15:48.241 --> 00:15:50.910
like,
what is this?
And that goes,
oh,
it's apple TV.

284
00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:54.660
So now if you go on Ebay or if you go on amazon.com and you look at apple TV,

285
00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:57.060
like the new version,
like $99 and the old version,

286
00:15:57.061 --> 00:15:58.740
it's like $300 because there's so,

287
00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:02.370
<v 3>but to that hack,
wait til you come back to my place.</v>

288
00:16:02.371 --> 00:16:07.000
I've been cleaning out my office and I found a fucking song on Apple Camera.
Hmm.

289
00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:08.940
Oh,
back when apple made camera.

290
00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:10.470
<v 2>Yeah,
I remember when you buy it.</v>

291
00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:13.260
I was jealous of that camera every time I would come to your house.
I'm like,

292
00:16:13.261 --> 00:16:14.460
are you gonna use that?
Because they,

293
00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:16.630
cause I wanted to get one and then they went out.

294
00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:18.440
They stopped selling it like the week after you,

295
00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:22.110
<v 3>we should use it and uh,
take uh,
well,
um,</v>

296
00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:26.090
we're to develop a website for this fucking show.
Finally,

297
00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:28.070
after two years of doing it,

298
00:16:28.071 --> 00:16:31.460
I figured like it should be its own website and one of the things we could do is

299
00:16:31.461 --> 00:16:36.210
take photos with that shit camera and it's Shitty.
It's really cool.

300
00:16:36.211 --> 00:16:38.860
I'd like to,
but it would be interesting to show people what out.

301
00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:42.470
Don't open that shit.
That shit's,
you have it in the box.
Brand new.

302
00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:47.930
I don't know.
A A,
maybe I did,
but not anymore.
The box is gone.

303
00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:50.210
<v 2>That shit was awesome.
They need to go back to make it.</v>

304
00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:54.380
I liked these cameras that are in the,
in the,
in the imax and

305
00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:58.160
<v 3>the camera anymore though.
Everybody wants a camera on your phone.
Yeah.</v>

306
00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.590
You don't want a camera anymore but like skyping and all that shit.

307
00:17:00.591 --> 00:17:01.880
So Pot facetiming on your,

308
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.000
I use video all the time on my laptop camera that can't call anybody stupid ass.

309
00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:11.370
<v 2>When you're at home,
don't you ever like facetime or video chat with your family?</v>

310
00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:15.550
Like,
like hotel when you're in a hotel room like,
well there you go.
That's what

311
00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:19.930
<v 3>I'm saying.
That's a phone.
I'm doing that with doing that with the laptop.</v>

312
00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:22.990
That's what I'm saying.
Yeah.
But it's not like a camera,
like a camera.

313
00:17:22.991 --> 00:17:26.700
I'm saying an individual camera on its own can go suck his dick.
Oh,
right,
right.

314
00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:30.820
And then the individual cameras are stupid.
I don't need you anymore.
I need,
yeah,

315
00:17:30.821 --> 00:17:31.390
I need,
I don't know.

316
00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:34.720
I walked by the aisle and best buy where they have like little cameras was a

317
00:17:34.721 --> 00:17:36.940
little tiny camera.
Like what are you doing with this?
Yeah,

318
00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:39.670
the fuck you wasting tire for do you don't have a camera on your phone yet?

319
00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:43.000
All that shit.
No,
I mean the,
yeah,
but that came on the phone.

320
00:17:43.001 --> 00:17:46.330
It's still not as good but we're going to force it.
We're gonna force it again.

321
00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:49.740
I don't know man.
I mean like journalists and stuff.
When we were covering occupy,

322
00:17:49.741 --> 00:17:49.980
like

323
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.650
<v 6>if you look,
if,
if someone stole my phone,</v>

324
00:17:52.651 --> 00:17:55.890
I looked like a fucking crazy person because the only pictures I have in my

325
00:17:55.891 --> 00:18:00.891
phone are cops beating the shit out of protestors and then,

326
00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:02.460
and then you flip it and it's like,

327
00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:06.240
oh there's my Hitler cat and like my fat cat and it's like my cats holding.

328
00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:09.540
And then you'd turn it and it's just like a fucking bloody kid like screaming

329
00:18:09.541 --> 00:18:12.420
for help and then you turn it and it's like,
aw,
pennies in a box.

330
00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:16.710
Like it's fucking in my cats and police brutality is my phone.

331
00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:21.820
My is half of them as Joey Dia,
smoking joints have to fill it out.
So my fuck.

332
00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:23.800
So that's like the equivalent of my cat photos.
Right.

333
00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:28.560
My kids and Joey Diaz smoking weed.
That's half my photos.

334
00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:30.180
I got to release those to.

335
00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:33.750
But I mean a lot of those photos that like kids were taking that and occupy,

336
00:18:33.751 --> 00:18:36.840
we're like making it to like mainstream publications just from like iPhone like

337
00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:41.370
an for sure.
Solid.
Yeah.
I mean it's amazing the video.
I mean some,
some,

338
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:45.440
some of the best like leaked video of occupied came off of phones.
Right.

339
00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:49.770
And it was uploaded like instantly,
which is just so fucking bad ass.

340
00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:54.750
What a weird world we live in.
Don't know,
but nobody likes it.
Have you seen this?

341
00:18:54.751 --> 00:18:58.680
A new video of these cops in La beating the shit out of a homeless guy.

342
00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:03.900
I mean just fucking with him and then he tries to get away and they beat the

343
00:19:03.901 --> 00:19:06.150
shit out of him with clubs and kicked him.

344
00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:11.460
Police brutality has gotten worse or we're just seeing it more because I think

345
00:19:11.461 --> 00:19:13.530
it's gotten better.
I think it's gotten better.

346
00:19:13.531 --> 00:19:15.780
I think it was way worse before they were accountable.

347
00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:19.650
I think now where we're seeing it and they realize like,

348
00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:24.980
do you know how much that Uc Davis cunt bag guy who sprayed pepper and those

349
00:19:25.501 --> 00:19:29.310
little children's faces that a lot of you,
that piece of Shit,
you're not bad.

350
00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:34.310
He must've felt after that was over the impact it must've been on is his health

351
00:19:34.651 --> 00:19:38.050
right?
Almost as bad as being pepper sprayed worse.

352
00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:41.550
It's all of these people responding,
coming back its worst.

353
00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:45.700
Did you see the way they protest?
They protested the dean and was like the curb.

354
00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:49.110
He has the silent beautiful,
amazing.
It was beautiful.
It was perfect.

355
00:19:49.111 --> 00:19:52.080
Nobody fucked up.
Nobody yelled if he explained it what they did.

356
00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:53.700
So what happened was,
um,

357
00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:57.630
the dean who was the one who called the police and I'm on these protesters who

358
00:19:57.631 --> 00:19:59.580
were a peaceful protesters are,
they weren't doing anything.

359
00:19:59.581 --> 00:20:02.790
They were just like making a line.
And you know,
during that whole constituted,

360
00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:06.300
it was over money.
Right?
It was over this crazy budget cuts.

361
00:20:06.301 --> 00:20:09.060
Like a lot of the schools in California,
especially our,
you know,

362
00:20:09.061 --> 00:20:12.090
we don't have time for school because we're not going to tax billionaires,
blah,

363
00:20:12.091 --> 00:20:14.520
blah,
blah.
Which by the way,
anyone listening to the show that's like,

364
00:20:14.521 --> 00:20:16.530
I'm a small business owner.
I'm the 1%,

365
00:20:16.531 --> 00:20:20.780
you're not the fucking 1% unless you're a fucking billionaire or senator or

366
00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:25.670
tried to tell me that I was a 1% and I was like,
come on to the,

367
00:20:25.671 --> 00:20:28.620
you don't even know what that means.
You can,
you can't say one,
but that's silly.

368
00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:32.560
1% it shows are really rich.
Yeah.
Yeah.

369
00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:36.810
And they got their money by making you really poor.
Um,

370
00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:38.940
and so,
so yeah,

371
00:20:38.941 --> 00:20:42.390
so the dean was expecting this huge protest cause like thousands of people

372
00:20:42.391 --> 00:20:45.660
showed up.
And what ended up happening when she was leaving,

373
00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:48.400
it was like dusk and there were thousands of people,

374
00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:53.240
<v 5>but you know,
screaming and chanting or whatever.
A fucking throwing glitter,</v>

375
00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:55.460
glitter honor.
Uh,
they were silent.

376
00:20:55.820 --> 00:21:00.050
It was this parking lot of like thousands of just silent people.

377
00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:03.620
And she just had to walk to her car in fucking shame,

378
00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:06.200
like with her head down and just beautiful.

379
00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:09.990
Thousands of eyes on you and no one's saying anything.
No,

380
00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:14.900
pull it up cause it's so creepy.
It's so crunchy to watch and listen to.
Yeah.

381
00:21:14.901 --> 00:21:18.520
This is a better setup.
[inaudible] House.
What should I listen at?

382
00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:22.060
Uc Davis.
What was their official position?

383
00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:26.150
I think if you just put like silent silent protest.
Yeah,
we'll blue.

384
00:21:26.151 --> 00:21:30.410
She the president of the UC Davis.
That's something,
well I want to say counselor.

385
00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:33.770
You mean my description of silence doesn't convey it.

386
00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:38.300
I'm 45 years old.
White guys.
I don't know what chancellor means.
Knows.
I mean,

387
00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:41.210
I don't know the difference.
You said you were a chancellor and Dean Dean,

388
00:21:41.211 --> 00:21:44.180
I think you're the main guy in a movie who eventually all the lesson,

389
00:21:45.290 --> 00:21:47.180
you're the guy that the frat gets back at.
Yeah,

390
00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:50.790
they were giving spade is your assistant or a David Spade [inaudible] character.

391
00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:54.700
Let's set that.
The W at one point in time.
And that song,

392
00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:58.100
that was an original movie animal house.
Oh yeah,
this is it.
Yeah.

393
00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:05.170
<v 3>So she steps outside with two other people and there are thousands of kids.</v>

394
00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:06.573
Thousands.

395
00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:11.290
And this is all you hear is her walking and then she is surrounded by thousands

396
00:22:11.291 --> 00:22:16.060
of kids on their knees.
Thousands candles.

397
00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:17.740
Wouldn't it be crazy if they went

398
00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:19.860
<v 0>ah,</v>

399
00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:22.710
<v 5>fucking charged her altogether,
right?</v>

400
00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:25.660
<v 3>No.
It would be just as fucked up.</v>

401
00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:28.490
<v 5>I would probably,
that's the end of the world.
That'd be a more popular movie.</v>

402
00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:33.710
That's stupid.
Yeah.
That's day the debt.
That's what starts the Zombie apocalypse.

403
00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:34.311
And this is the,

404
00:22:34.311 --> 00:22:37.070
they're still walking folks and they were thought while she's walking,

405
00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:39.590
there are thousands of kids to the left and the right.

406
00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:40.640
And I don't know how good the sound is,

407
00:22:40.641 --> 00:22:43.400
but I mean there are times that you can hear a shoes.
Uh,

408
00:22:43.401 --> 00:22:47.360
I mean there are times where you hear size,
like it's,
yeah,
the shoes of like the,

409
00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:50.900
the photographer's chasing her.
You could hear a nose whistle.
Guess what folks,

410
00:22:50.901 --> 00:22:55.370
if you can force 2000 people to be on their knees and,
and,

411
00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:56.780
and be quiet like that,

412
00:22:56.810 --> 00:23:00.050
they really believe what the fuck they're doing it before it.
That's real.

413
00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:04.010
It's like in the Simpsons where,
uh,
Lisa breaks up with Ralph and they go,

414
00:23:04.011 --> 00:23:06.470
if you rewind,
why did,
you can actually hear where it was heartbreaks.

415
00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:11.470
And they do check that some that a sound that's some right versus wrong shit

416
00:23:11.571 --> 00:23:14.120
right there and pretty clear forums.
So here's a question I have for you.

417
00:23:14.121 --> 00:23:16.640
I think you'd be a good person to ask about police brutality is,

418
00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:18.170
there's part of me,
the thing,
so like,

419
00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:24.020
people really loved the idea of tasers and you know,

420
00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:27.920
even weapons,
they use that at protests like rubber bullets and stuff like that.

421
00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:30.530
And even though now it's come out that,
you know,

422
00:23:30.531 --> 00:23:33.530
many people have died many times the people who have been tasered have been the

423
00:23:33.531 --> 00:23:37.190
elderly,
mentally handicapped people who really did not innocent people,
children,

424
00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:41.360
people who did not,
uh,
necessarily need to be born really a threat.
Right?
I mean,

425
00:23:41.361 --> 00:23:43.730
there was literally a story recently,
we talked about it on the show,

426
00:23:43.731 --> 00:23:46.310
but I'm forgetting the details,
but a kid

427
00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:48.650
<v 4>was just like getting suspended or whatever.</v>

428
00:23:48.651 --> 00:23:52.400
And a cop was standing there and like,
like she tried to run her sounding like,

429
00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:57.380
fuck Taser like children.
It was a young kid.
Right,
right.
So,
so my question is,

430
00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:02.230
and I think I have my,
my answer on what I think is that,
um,

431
00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:07.480
part of me thinks that like,
and I'm not like going after all the police,
like,

432
00:24:07.481 --> 00:24:10.370
I don't want to fucking tweets about like your dad being a good cop.

433
00:24:10.371 --> 00:24:14.480
I'm just saying like,
the people who have like Tasers,
Paula did,

434
00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:19.220
people who have tasered children,
but let's start there.
Um,

435
00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:24.420
part of me is just like,
what happened to,
I get up there like an actual threat,

436
00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:27.650
then the Taser is better than like shooting a guy to death.
Right?
Um,

437
00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:29.660
but if you're not a threat,
if you're unarmed,

438
00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:31.310
if you're just being like difficult,

439
00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:35.600
like what happened to like cops having to fucking subdued these people?

440
00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:39.800
Like why are all these like MMA guys doing like fucking Jujitsu seminars for law

441
00:24:39.801 --> 00:24:42.680
enforcement?
If people have just started fucking tape,
like,

442
00:24:42.681 --> 00:24:47.390
that wasn't the point of the Taser.
The Taser was supposed to be,
uh,

443
00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:48.980
before deadly threat.

444
00:24:48.981 --> 00:24:51.290
So they're not proposing enough of a threat where you have to use,
I'm sorry,

445
00:24:51.291 --> 00:24:52.940
deadly force because I remember like,

446
00:24:52.941 --> 00:24:56.000
do you remember when that dude like ran under the baseball field and he got

447
00:24:56.001 --> 00:25:00.170
tased?
Uh,
and it was this really popular youtube clip cause they were like,
ah,

448
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:01.160
dudes getting tased.

449
00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:04.460
And I remember even liberals that follow me on Twitter when I was like,

450
00:25:04.461 --> 00:25:07.640
so this is fucked up.
Um,
would like that's what he gets bro.

451
00:25:07.641 --> 00:25:10.400
That's what he gets for running on to a baseball field.
I'm like,

452
00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:12.020
he gets a fucking electrocuted.

453
00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:15.140
Like what happened to the days where the cops had to get off their fucking ass.

454
00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:18.140
Chase someone be in good shape and just,

455
00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:22.010
<v 3>I agree.
I disagree with you there.
Okay.
Okay.</v>

456
00:25:22.011 --> 00:25:25.760
I think Taser the fuck on the idiot that runs in the field because he's a
retard.

457
00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:26.181
Okay.

458
00:25:26.181 --> 00:25:29.900
And we need to show everybody that it really sucks when you run onto a field

459
00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:32.300
because we've got a shitty stupid cavity,

460
00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:36.410
a copycat society where if one asshole gets away with charging,

461
00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:40.520
you know a a baseball player and gets a high five out of the baseball player

462
00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:42.890
before he gets tackled to the ground.
By the way,

463
00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:45.050
raise the officers that are tackling to the ground.

464
00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:47.000
When you get into a physical altercation with somebody,

465
00:25:47.001 --> 00:25:50.720
you risk really getting hurt and you,
and you're a guy who's just look at this.

466
00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:53.870
This guy's running around.
He's a fucking idiot.

467
00:25:53.871 --> 00:25:58.040
He's ruining the game toys or this asshole.
We can all agree.
Okay,
once it's down,

468
00:25:58.041 --> 00:25:59.990
they shouldn't get tasered him.
This is what the problem is.

469
00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:03.230
Unless they tasered him to drop it and look like he dropped himself,

470
00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:07.280
that is one of those ones that shoot out.
Let me say it came back it up again.

471
00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:09.920
Let me say it because it looked to me for a second there.

472
00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:12.560
Like he lied down and then they tasered him when they came.

473
00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:15.740
I know it's when the ones that shoot out,
there's little spikes with the cables.

474
00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:19.580
Oh,
okay.
My favorite.
Okay.

475
00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:22.160
Zap some in the back right there and that's when he goes down.
Well,
yeah.

476
00:26:22.161 --> 00:26:26.060
Fuck that guy.
That guy's an idiot.
Guys running around the field.
He's a retard.

477
00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:29.420
These poor guys with families and lives and needs and bodies,

478
00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:33.170
what they should have to risk their fucking knees and neck to take down this

479
00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:36.300
asshole.
You know you can get an injury taking a man down.

480
00:26:36.570 --> 00:26:39.410
You sustain for the rest of your life.
Why?

481
00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:43.980
Because some dickhead wants to be cute and ruin a whole baseball game

482
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:47.460
<v 6>forever.
But we get me wrong.
If somebody,</v>

483
00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:51.390
if somebody is talking at a movie in a whisper,
I'm just like,

484
00:26:51.391 --> 00:26:54.660
why can't I should I should break their neck like I'm,
I,
I definitely like,

485
00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:55.950
I hate assholes like that.

486
00:26:55.951 --> 00:26:59.340
I can't be fucking around drunk people if I have to like leave my,

487
00:26:59.341 --> 00:27:01.920
like I had to leave Vegas at like five in the morning so there were still drunk

488
00:27:01.921 --> 00:27:05.070
people from the night before.
I fucking fled that city.

489
00:27:05.071 --> 00:27:07.770
Like it was like fucking walking dead.
Like I was just like,

490
00:27:07.771 --> 00:27:11.490
get me the fuck out of here.
I hate people like that and find him,
arrest him,

491
00:27:11.491 --> 00:27:14.400
whatever.
But like when if he died,

492
00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:19.080
which many people have because of the conditions,
but that's some hunger game.

493
00:27:19.081 --> 00:27:22.800
Shit.
Listen,
who don't do that again?
Don't do that again.
He's dead.
He's dead.

494
00:27:22.801 --> 00:27:26.820
Everybody else knows now you can get fucking zap to death if you're an asshole

495
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.260
because we don't need any encouragement for assholes.
Okay?
We need,

496
00:27:30.261 --> 00:27:31.081
this is what I believe.

497
00:27:31.081 --> 00:27:33.970
This is what I believe can stop this whole police brutality problem,
right?

498
00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:38.460
We have to make our relationship with the cops different.

499
00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:43.350
The cops are supposed to be respected members of our community that are there to

500
00:27:43.351 --> 00:27:45.240
help us.
When the shit goes wrong,

501
00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:50.450
it's become because by shitty management and by old asshole con fuck head was

502
00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:51.781
white shirt,

503
00:27:51.781 --> 00:27:55.800
Douche bags that you see punching kids that it all trickles down from the top

504
00:27:55.801 --> 00:27:59.760
and they established the attitude for the younger officers and these guys who go

505
00:27:59.761 --> 00:28:00.220
into the,

506
00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:05.220
into the police academies with good intentions can be corrupted by old jaded

507
00:28:05.881 --> 00:28:08.250
motherfuckers.
Shitty way of looking at people.
I mean,

508
00:28:08.251 --> 00:28:12.690
so many times we have to look at it differently to this us versus them

509
00:28:12.691 --> 00:28:13.381
mentality.

510
00:28:13.381 --> 00:28:18.060
A lot of times comes from people that have a distrust of police from the past or

511
00:28:18.061 --> 00:28:21.760
of of things that they've seen as when it comes to corruption or things that

512
00:28:21.761 --> 00:28:24.780
they've seen when it comes to brutality or they're just a bunch of assholes that

513
00:28:24.781 --> 00:28:27.030
are always doing crimes is they always have to deal with cops.

514
00:28:27.031 --> 00:28:31.170
Go and cut the shit man.
Right?
So it develops that way.
So let's go back.
So like,

515
00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:31.650
all right,

516
00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:35.050
I picked like the most hateable guy by saying I'm the guy who ran the feet.

517
00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:42.240
Going back to like the retarded people going back to kids and shit like that.

518
00:28:42.241 --> 00:28:44.660
It's like because I have met a lot of no way,

519
00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:46.560
no matter what about retarded people that are violent.

520
00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:51.540
You say retarded but I mean you mean downstairs rooms and there were stories of

521
00:28:51.541 --> 00:28:55.710
like and really strong or they have the shirt but they had the mental capacity

522
00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:58.020
of a child and then they have no weapons or anything.

523
00:28:58.230 --> 00:29:00.730
It's just like they're not doing what the cops are telling them to do.
Yeah.

524
00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:04.110
When you see a dude who's like mentally ill and he's lifting weights,

525
00:29:04.111 --> 00:29:06.720
what good can come out of that?
It gets even stronger.

526
00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:10.450
Maybe he could be a superhero.
You shouldn't look,

527
00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:13.760
I don't think you should let him mentally handicapped people if words,
is that a,

528
00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:16.920
is that a bad thing to say?
I'm sure it is.
Probably is right.

529
00:29:16.921 --> 00:29:19.050
It's probably super offensive,
mainly because like,

530
00:29:19.051 --> 00:29:21.980
we're in the kettle bell selling business people,
but I mean,
I don't,

531
00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:24.450
I'm not sure if you want like,
unless they're like really cool,

532
00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:25.981
but if you had them in,

533
00:29:25.981 --> 00:29:28.710
they're really like to have like a conversation with them and just be like,

534
00:29:28.711 --> 00:29:31.980
so kind of music.
Can you,
what do you,
what are you thinking about first dates?

535
00:29:33.290 --> 00:29:37.680
When should a girl put out and it just gets violent?
Oh,

536
00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:42.430
take the kettlebells away.
Yeah.
You can't get any stronger dude.
Um,

537
00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:46.150
<v 1>what I was gonna say about the,
the white shirts is,
you know,
a,
yeah.</v>

538
00:29:46.151 --> 00:29:49.720
Once you have that sort of,
uh,
versus them,

539
00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:52.340
the US versus them permeates man.

540
00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:56.440
I used to work as a security guard at a concert place and,
uh,

541
00:29:56.441 --> 00:29:59.600
there was like one of the first days I was there,
this guy,
uh,

542
00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:03.160
his name was alley cat.
It was just crazy dude.
He,
uh,

543
00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:08.980
this kid stole a golf cart and they tackled the kid and got on top of him and

544
00:30:09.101 --> 00:30:13.240
beat him with a walkie talkie.
I mean,

545
00:30:13.241 --> 00:30:14.200
it was pretty intense.

546
00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:17.200
And this is one of my first days on the job and I was like,
all right,

547
00:30:17.201 --> 00:30:21.430
I guess I know how shit goes down here guys.
We're not fucking around.

548
00:30:21.550 --> 00:30:26.260
He had a group of psychopaths working for him and that was the whole concert

549
00:30:26.261 --> 00:30:30.250
security.
They were just down to if,
I mean they weren't like assaulting people.

550
00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:31.660
Right.
It was only assholes.

551
00:30:31.661 --> 00:30:33.850
I mean someone had to do some take a swing at them first,

552
00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:38.620
but they were excited to fuck up drunk people that were assholes.

553
00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:41.230
I mean they were,
I mean they never did anything that was illegal.

554
00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:43.300
Everything they did was completely legal for the job.

555
00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:47.490
But our job essentially I got hired,
it was me and um,

556
00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:51.850
nine black belts from my taekwondo academy.
So that was the whole security team.

557
00:30:51.851 --> 00:30:55.120
It was the,
the,
the Taekwondo Academy.
An alley cat.
And he's like buddies,

558
00:30:55.121 --> 00:30:57.890
you're guys competition team and the walkie talkie.
Yeah,
and out,

559
00:30:57.910 --> 00:31:02.350
but alley cat and his buddies were these big fucking hockey player looking dudes

560
00:31:02.351 --> 00:31:05.770
with tough ass Boston dudes and they'd been working in the security business for

561
00:31:05.771 --> 00:31:07.210
years.
They were just down to fuck people up.

562
00:31:07.211 --> 00:31:10.660
They weren't necessarily like martial arts trained martial arts,
but you know,

563
00:31:10.661 --> 00:31:12.610
they knew how to fight.
They were ready to fuck people up.

564
00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:15.220
But so was the most ridiculous setup ever.

565
00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:20.430
These drunk idiot concert goers surrounded by train killers who are led by a

566
00:31:20.711 --> 00:31:22.030
complete psychopath.

567
00:31:22.031 --> 00:31:26.770
Who encouraged you to fuck up people who stepped out of line,
Hey,
rent a cop.

568
00:31:26.771 --> 00:31:30.340
What do you know what their walkie talkie?
Stop it.
Yeah.

569
00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:34.490
Well if you were fucking around man,
he would beat your ass.
Uh,
it was,
uh,

570
00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:37.330
but you develop that mentality.
You've been working there.

571
00:31:37.331 --> 00:31:39.820
I noticed that mentality,
like a real commonplace analogy.

572
00:31:39.821 --> 00:31:42.070
It's like whenever you're a pedestrian,

573
00:31:42.071 --> 00:31:43.420
like walking around New York and you're like,

574
00:31:43.421 --> 00:31:45.670
he's fucking idiot taxis and stuff like that.

575
00:31:45.671 --> 00:31:47.080
And then you're in a cab or a car and you're like,

576
00:31:47.081 --> 00:31:49.810
fucking run him over these asshole pedestrians where it's like,
yeah,

577
00:31:49.811 --> 00:31:51.520
you just get into this fucking mode.
And here's the thing.

578
00:31:51.521 --> 00:31:54.930
Like when we were at NATO,
which like erupted,
um,

579
00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:57.550
for the protest in Chicago,
uh,

580
00:31:57.580 --> 00:32:01.420
the first day the cops were actually like the cops.
I talked to were super chill.

581
00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:04.150
Um,
we're one dude sided ugs tee shirt on and he's like,

582
00:32:04.151 --> 00:32:05.860
where are you trained man?
And we just like talked about,

583
00:32:05.861 --> 00:32:09.040
you see such a common thing with people that,
you know,

584
00:32:09.041 --> 00:32:10.750
if you find someone that trains,

585
00:32:11.050 --> 00:32:13.390
you know when you train it's like automatically it's like,

586
00:32:13.391 --> 00:32:15.700
I know I could probably talk to this guy how long you've been to,
you've been,

587
00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:18.700
you're a purple belt.
Oh,
I,
I've had a,

588
00:32:18.701 --> 00:32:20.200
I've been wearing Jiu Jitsu shirts ever since.

589
00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:26.440
The cops won't beat you as hard.
No.
Right.
I'm worried.
Fortes you bro.

590
00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:27.940
Or it'll just be like an Austin would be like,

591
00:32:27.941 --> 00:32:30.910
you can start and half guard and then I'm going to teach you to dance with my

592
00:32:30.911 --> 00:32:34.510
walkie talkie.
Just don't run on two baseball fields.
That's all I'm saying folks.

593
00:32:34.511 --> 00:32:38.680
So I don't think cops should be tasted old ladies.
We had a fucking,
we had a,
um,

594
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:39.980
I think in NATO we're actually was a

595
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:43.820
<v 4>white shirt that stuck up for my,
my,
my partner has a dozen radio.</v>

596
00:32:43.821 --> 00:32:45.940
My wife is like much more like realistic.
Like,

597
00:32:45.941 --> 00:32:48.260
sometimes I get like idealistic and she's like,
right,

598
00:32:48.261 --> 00:32:51.070
but if you're going to stop being stupid about it and you're like,
I'm like,
oh,

599
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:55.660
you're right.
Um,
you're more lefty hippie than her.
Uh,
she,
no,

600
00:32:55.670 --> 00:33:00.140
she,
she's just,
she's much more of like a,
I'm kind of like a,

601
00:33:00.141 --> 00:33:01.820
maybe we can all get along and she was like,

602
00:33:01.821 --> 00:33:03.710
or maybe we should learn how to fire a gun.

603
00:33:05.390 --> 00:33:07.790
<v 3>Well,
you know what,
when you were a woman,
I think,
you know,</v>

604
00:33:07.791 --> 00:33:12.200
dealing with the idea that the other side of the coin is always going to be

605
00:33:12.201 --> 00:33:16.550
stronger.
The other sex is always stronger,
more aggressive,
more dangerous,

606
00:33:16.790 --> 00:33:21.620
and the chances of a woman doing you harm versus the chance of a man doing your

607
00:33:21.621 --> 00:33:26.210
harm are staggeringly different.
So just growing up like that,

608
00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:29.020
I think you automatically,
you go,
you know,
you realize like,
no,

609
00:33:29.030 --> 00:33:31.820
you need a fucking God that you're in a fucking,

610
00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:35.660
you're in a zoo filled with wild chimps.
That's,
that's what humanity,

611
00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:38.470
<v 4>even with a,
I've got to go back to the story,
but even like,</v>

612
00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:43.630
there's so much shit that like whenever that,
that I just like being a girl,

613
00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:44.740
like if you're a woman,

614
00:33:44.741 --> 00:33:47.620
like you probably can't go to like a family reunion without having your tits.

615
00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:48.650
<v 3>That,
you know what I mean?</v>

616
00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:52.790
It's like hen thinking about creepy uncles that might've been touched,

617
00:33:52.791 --> 00:33:56.210
you inappropriately squeeze your butt when you were 10 or did something and who

618
00:33:56.211 --> 00:33:59.690
knows what worse or all the kids that you did it too.
You know,

619
00:33:59.691 --> 00:34:01.650
dare you Brian Terry,

620
00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:05.680
<v 4>I'm cool.
And all I want to do is be the cool uncle.
But I'm like,
man,</v>

621
00:34:05.681 --> 00:34:09.430
too many uncles fuck kids that now there's no cool uncle connotation.

622
00:34:09.431 --> 00:34:12.730
It's all crazy uncle connotation.
Yeah.
I mean you can't look at it as an uncle.

623
00:34:12.731 --> 00:34:14.740
You got to look at as you're their friend and you love them.

624
00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:16.970
And it was a pup fuck labels,
right?

625
00:34:16.971 --> 00:34:21.430
Just cause some other old dude tried to dental.
So a,

626
00:34:21.431 --> 00:34:25.060
so with the NATO thing,
uh,
it was crazy.

627
00:34:25.061 --> 00:34:30.061
So like Alison and I actually got like the closest pretty much I thought this

628
00:34:30.410 --> 00:34:34.390
like white cop,
I thought I liked charmed them.
And what happened was,
uh,

629
00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:39.310
we kept like breaking through the police lines for some reason.
And in New York,

630
00:34:39.311 --> 00:34:42.970
usually what happens is protesters on one side,
cops on one side,

631
00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:46.480
either a protest or moves or a cop moves,
something happens.

632
00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:49.600
The police swarm and they start tackling some kid.

633
00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:52.570
And what was great about New York is there's this like camaraderie among all the

634
00:34:52.571 --> 00:34:55.000
journalists where suddenly you had 50 journalists,

635
00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:58.210
like the cops right here got 50 journalists over taking pictures,

636
00:34:58.211 --> 00:35:00.190
ask them what the kid's name is.
You have the lawyers,

637
00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:03.040
the lawyers guilts would wear hats.
So people knew the lawyers,

638
00:35:03.041 --> 00:35:04.030
they would have rounded up front.

639
00:35:04.930 --> 00:35:09.930
And this is like some old school gangs of New York types was some gang warfare.

640
00:35:10.331 --> 00:35:10.510
Dude,

641
00:35:10.510 --> 00:35:13.030
I'll show you a picture after the show that I have to find on my phone where

642
00:35:13.031 --> 00:35:16.740
it's just like,
it was the anarchists,
uh,
the black block.
And it was a,

643
00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:19.270
just a banner that said,
fuck the police.
And they were here.

644
00:35:19.271 --> 00:35:22.960
And the police were here and some of the cops were like,
Eh,
they don't mean it.

645
00:35:23.350 --> 00:35:27.700
Uh,
but anyway,
so wow,
we're used to the report and it said fuck the police.

646
00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:29.710
I only saw it once.
That wasn't like an occupy thing.

647
00:35:29.711 --> 00:35:33.520
That was like a side like occupy is not hardcore enough for us.

648
00:35:34.450 --> 00:35:34.751
<v 3>Right.</v>

649
00:35:34.751 --> 00:35:38.580
What do you think about the people that believed that a of that is actually

650
00:35:38.581 --> 00:35:40.410
people that are cops undercover?

651
00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:41.720
<v 4>They're all,
I've seen it.
You've seen</v>

652
00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:46.610
the instigators or uh,
I haven't seen,

653
00:35:46.611 --> 00:35:50.060
I've only seen videos and read articles about the cops actually being the ones

654
00:35:50.061 --> 00:35:54.230
that started the violence.
What is the,
what does the term for that?
So the tour,

655
00:35:54.231 --> 00:35:58.640
what is it?
Uh,
Oh uh,
agent provocateur.
A provocateur.
Yeah.
Yeah.

656
00:35:58.790 --> 00:36:02.420
And uh,
yeah,
that shit's happened.
I mean I remember just undercover cops,

657
00:36:02.570 --> 00:36:04.130
they're usually like fairly obvious.

658
00:36:04.131 --> 00:36:07.850
We interviewed two that we're convinced really well cause it was just a tall

659
00:36:07.851 --> 00:36:10.340
dude with a crew cut who had a rage against the machine shirt.
And I was like,

660
00:36:10.341 --> 00:36:13.460
come on man.
Like you can't just put on a band shirt.

661
00:36:13.461 --> 00:36:15.920
Like he was like six to like he,
he just,

662
00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:19.820
the only thing that was missing was like his badge and gun and it was like a

663
00:36:19.821 --> 00:36:23.630
raging against it,
but it was like towards more like totally.

664
00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:25.700
And he was with a friend who like looked the same way.

665
00:36:25.701 --> 00:36:28.580
It looks like I have a fucking college wrestler like short,
stocky,

666
00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:32.510
and like he had like a fucking nirvana shirt on it,
which are ridiculous.
And uh,

667
00:36:32.511 --> 00:36:34.260
and so we were like,
let's just interview,

668
00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:37.730
maybe it will be really cool or maybe they'll clearly be cops.
And uh,

669
00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:41.000
this was in Times Square.
So the majority of people there,

670
00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:44.110
the march there wasn't that much.
Uh,
uh,

671
00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:47.120
like they announced it and then it happened pretty quickly.

672
00:36:47.121 --> 00:36:50.630
Like it wasn't like a big month thing where people are going to be flying in and

673
00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:53.830
were like,
so you guys from the city?
And they're like,
no,
we're from A,

674
00:36:54.110 --> 00:36:58.140
we're from Niagara Falls,
New York.
And we just,
uh,
took a bus,
like their story,

675
00:36:58.141 --> 00:37:01.010
it was like really detailed.
Like we took a bus down,

676
00:37:01.011 --> 00:37:03.930
just hit the open road trying to find herself.
And I'm just like,

677
00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:08.380
you're like,
oh,
Jimmy here is getting married next week.

678
00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:12.560
Like it was just like super fucking ridiculous and uh,
you know,

679
00:37:12.561 --> 00:37:13.170
it would be really fun.

680
00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:16.500
<v 3>Funny a show that was showed is called liars.
All right.</v>

681
00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:21.650
We just have people try to pretend to fit in with like different organizations

682
00:37:23.431 --> 00:37:25.890
like fitted with the occupy and

683
00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:28.820
<v 4>hey guys,
let's do something violent.
Am I right?</v>

684
00:37:30.190 --> 00:37:33.620
It's fuck the police man.
The fucking police are pigs.
Okay,

685
00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:36.410
let's get all kite on the phone,
right?
Yeah.
Or till up bro.

686
00:37:36.411 --> 00:37:39.590
I'm going to make a bomb.
Hey,
I saw rage against the machine.
I can,

687
00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:44.440
I can view the plants for a palm.
My sprint four G.
Um,
oh,

688
00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:45.700
so you said you saw it.

689
00:37:45.701 --> 00:37:48.980
Some people you definitely believe we're cops will cause you'd see him later and

690
00:37:48.981 --> 00:37:52.670
play clothes talking to the cops.
Um,
wow.
Uh,
yeah.

691
00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:56.420
And so they would infiltrate and trying to like,
well a lot of times,

692
00:37:56.421 --> 00:38:00.350
I mean there are a lot of them,
like I you have,

693
00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:03.590
there's no evidence that they're like place there to be agent provocateurs.

694
00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:06.080
But I mean they are trying to like get information.
I mean there were stories,

695
00:38:06.081 --> 00:38:10.670
the Guardian wrote a piece a little while ago about cops going undercover with

696
00:38:10.671 --> 00:38:12.260
activists and like fucking him,

697
00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:16.910
like just like fucking these girls and like really?
Yeah.
I mean like,
like

698
00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:22.450
<v 3>a lot of low hanging fruit.
Hippie lost hippies,
dude.</v>

699
00:38:22.451 --> 00:38:25.460
It's like he's,
he's Hippie,
but yet he's still oddly alpha.

700
00:38:25.461 --> 00:38:27.860
What's going on in here?
He smells like Cologne.

701
00:38:28.070 --> 00:38:32.170
A lot of yeast infections going on and then probably a lot of camping.
Yeah.

702
00:38:33.290 --> 00:38:36.100
Hey,
so the cops banging the chicks.

703
00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:38.380
<v 6>Ah,
how could you stop them?
But I'm like,</v>

704
00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:42.370
everybody likes a little hippie pussy though.
That's where we need,
uh,

705
00:38:42.490 --> 00:38:43.750
our undercover cops.
It was like,

706
00:38:43.751 --> 00:38:46.540
do you remember like during the lead up to the war in Iraq,
it was like,

707
00:38:47.050 --> 00:38:49.210
there were literally groups with peace in the title.

708
00:38:49.211 --> 00:38:52.000
It was like old ladies for peace and they'd be fucking narc showing up.

709
00:38:52.001 --> 00:38:55.420
And it's like,
do pieces on the title,
like,
you know what I mean?
Like there were,

710
00:38:55.450 --> 00:38:59.930
there were there real fucking criminals out there.
Protestors for peace.
Yeah,

711
00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:05.110
right.
We,
we,
we don't want to hurt the Iraqis,

712
00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:09.820
but we really want to hurt cops,
cops,
white,
white,
white cops who crew cuts.

713
00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:14.440
Oh.
So this,
uh,
this dude with this white shirt actually saved our ass.
So,

714
00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:17.740
uh,
he was one of the guys I was talking to the day before and we were kind of

715
00:39:17.741 --> 00:39:19.630
friendly and so we knew I was pressing the way.

716
00:39:19.630 --> 00:39:22.660
We're not saying we want to hurt white cops or crew cuts just for any idiot that

717
00:39:22.661 --> 00:39:26.260
listening to that,
we're pretending we're being a fake character in there.

718
00:39:26.261 --> 00:39:30.460
And they're like,
we're,
we're talking about an idiot thinking that not talk.
Okay,

719
00:39:30.490 --> 00:39:31.031
that is crazy.

720
00:39:31.031 --> 00:39:34.540
You have to preface that shit cause someone can take a fucking sound clip of

721
00:39:34.541 --> 00:39:39.190
that.
And you know,
they fucking hate white cops with a crew cuts this world.

722
00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:42.970
We're living in a world filled with dumb,
dumb,
dumb dumbs.

723
00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:47.440
That's part of the problem.
And some of them get to be cops and it's the real,

724
00:39:47.441 --> 00:39:49.060
the real problem is not cops.

725
00:39:49.061 --> 00:39:53.710
The real problem is just a staggering amount of stupid fucking assholes that are

726
00:39:53.770 --> 00:39:56.170
in every wall.
And it's,
it's,
it's ego too.

727
00:39:56.171 --> 00:40:01.171
We had a friend in New York who used to do like the cycle psychological

728
00:40:01.271 --> 00:40:05.410
evaluations for like the first level for a police training and she would just

729
00:40:05.411 --> 00:40:07.660
tell us these stories where like there was one dude,

730
00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:09.980
I'm to her the exact line if they're caught this,

731
00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:11.650
the question was pretty easy where it was like,

732
00:40:11.651 --> 00:40:13.650
why do you want to be a police officer and taking mine?

733
00:40:13.690 --> 00:40:16.810
Like you're being interviewed to be a cop.
This is like the one,
like if you're,

734
00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:19.000
this is the one time you just,
just don't be crazy.

735
00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:21.130
That's all you have to do to answer that.
Why do you want to be a cop?

736
00:40:21.131 --> 00:40:24.850
That's a stupid protect people all done.
Just don't be crazy for like 10 seconds.

737
00:40:25.090 --> 00:40:28.060
She goes,
why do you want to be a cop?
And he goes,

738
00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:32.290
so I can finally get the respect.
I deserve her.
Oh my God.

739
00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:37.330
What?
It's like,
that's the dude who's gonna fucking curb stomp somebody.

740
00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:40.990
Dude,
he's going to have a second walk.
You thought almost answer ever,

741
00:40:41.050 --> 00:40:43.960
but it's like how crazy are you that you couldn't even stifle that for the

742
00:40:43.961 --> 00:40:48.550
fucking interview,
isn't it Brian?
I guess it was ridiculous.

743
00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:52.240
Fucking so redundantly like ridiculous.
The Dome is answering.

744
00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:59.210
I deserve what?
Fuck some people up.
Uh,
but anyway,

745
00:40:59.211 --> 00:41:03.070
so I hate that because I think that cops are important.

746
00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:07.040
I hate that because I think that there's a real legitimate place for the police

747
00:41:07.330 --> 00:41:09.400
police force.
Of course.
I think you should be,

748
00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:13.030
it should be hard to get into the police force when you were a kid.

749
00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:14.140
I just remember being a kid,

750
00:41:14.141 --> 00:41:16.540
like my perception of cops mainly because of the war on drugs.

751
00:41:16.570 --> 00:41:19.160
I grew up with a car,
my dad was a cop.
Okay.
So no,

752
00:41:19.410 --> 00:41:22.020
I'm very violent then.

753
00:41:22.090 --> 00:41:25.330
Well then my story a little more realistic.
Yeah.
Gee,

754
00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:29.020
well because I grew up in like suburbia and like they would be our crossing

755
00:41:29.021 --> 00:41:32.140
guards and shit like that.
And so I grew up being like,
right,

756
00:41:32.141 --> 00:41:34.790
of course you trust the,
they're here to help.
Like they're always,

757
00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:36.440
and then the older I got like,

758
00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:40.130
and I just see like my friends get like jacked up for having like a dime bag of

759
00:41:40.131 --> 00:41:43.160
weed or like whatever.
Cause it was just bored fucking bully cops.

760
00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:45.800
I don't remember too much about my childhood,

761
00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:50.990
but I do specifically remember my father beating the fuck out of a teenage kid.

762
00:41:50.991 --> 00:41:55.400
Ones.
I forget what he did.
I don't remember the exact details of it,

763
00:41:55.430 --> 00:42:00.280
but it wasn't like murder.
No,
but he picked him up by his hair.
He was a,

764
00:42:00.410 --> 00:42:04.520
he was a scary guy and he was a cop.
So I grew up with that guy.
Yeah.

765
00:42:04.521 --> 00:42:07.160
And it's like,
well,
if that's how we're not really grew up.
So it was like six.

766
00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:09.170
Right.
But that's one of those things where it's like,
fuck man,

767
00:42:09.171 --> 00:42:12.170
if that's how he treats his family,
like what the fuck is going on?

768
00:42:12.171 --> 00:42:16.460
I always assumed,
eh,
growing up like that,
I always assumed everybody was crazy.

769
00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:18.380
I always assumed that everyone,

770
00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:23.720
when you have a father that is has a fuse that's like a half an inch long and

771
00:42:23.721 --> 00:42:26.440
it'll just explode on someone and beat the shit out of someone in front of you.

772
00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:31.340
When,
when you have that you,
you assume everybody has it of course.

773
00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:35.270
So I never looked at cops like,
well this cop is here to protect you.
It was just,

774
00:42:35.271 --> 00:42:38.010
this top could be crazy like by dad outta here.

775
00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:41.840
The people get nasty with you when they,
when they,
you know,

776
00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:46.730
think about how mad people are at little simple things in road rage,
rental,

777
00:42:46.731 --> 00:42:49.460
simple things like you missed your exit and he tried to get in front of them and

778
00:42:49.461 --> 00:42:53.420
they'll fucking honk their horns or mine make it seem like they've never done

779
00:42:53.421 --> 00:42:53.901
that before.

780
00:42:53.901 --> 00:42:58.040
Have you never barely made the exit and tried to cut over and there was enough

781
00:42:58.041 --> 00:43:01.640
space.
It's not like you would a slam on your brakes.
You almost died.

782
00:43:01.930 --> 00:43:04.550
I to do what I was saying.
I was going to the airport,

783
00:43:04.551 --> 00:43:08.150
I was taking the train from Penn station and a I bump shoulders but just as like

784
00:43:08.151 --> 00:43:12.120
fucking just due to suit look like a normal dude.
He was like,
oh,
I'm late.

785
00:43:12.121 --> 00:43:13.580
And he just started screaming and I was like,
dude,

786
00:43:13.581 --> 00:43:16.070
you got to walk away from this.
Like this is like an iPhone.

787
00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:18.650
I've never had that level of anger.

788
00:43:18.651 --> 00:43:21.140
Like the only times I've almost gotten into an altercation,
it was like,

789
00:43:21.141 --> 00:43:23.620
all right,
do I have to defend somebody or do I have to defend myself?

790
00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:25.460
I have a completely different occupation.

791
00:43:25.490 --> 00:43:27.050
If you're doing something that you hate all day,

792
00:43:27.051 --> 00:43:29.710
which is what I'm saying with these cops,
you're running into them,

793
00:43:29.730 --> 00:43:31.850
they're already at nine.
That's a really good point,
right?

794
00:43:31.851 --> 00:43:34.940
Where like a lot of the protesters who were trying to reason with these cops are

795
00:43:34.941 --> 00:43:38.300
just like,
dude,
we are fighting so you can get pension so you're fucking,

796
00:43:38.450 --> 00:43:39.980
benefits aren't going to get taken away.

797
00:43:39.981 --> 00:43:44.981
And the problem with the cops is day she'd be getting paid a shit who was

798
00:43:45.411 --> 00:43:47.990
already turned this off and was like Kilstein hot and it's like left.

799
00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:51.110
Like if their friends around please play this part as well.
Uh,

800
00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:54.020
they should be getting paid so much more fun.
Yeah,
I mean,

801
00:43:54.021 --> 00:43:58.490
if you're getting paid the same manager awarded a shitty retail job,

802
00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:00.890
like of course you're going to be fucking angry and you're like,

803
00:44:00.891 --> 00:44:04.100
I had a friend who I do Jujitsu with who when we first started talking about

804
00:44:04.101 --> 00:44:07.460
occupy,
he's a cop.
When we first start talking about occupy,
he was like,
yeah,

805
00:44:07.461 --> 00:44:09.880
you know,
like I totally support him and you know,

806
00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:11.900
they have the right to be down there and blah,
blah,
blah.

807
00:44:12.110 --> 00:44:15.800
And then by the time it was like three months in and he got dragged down and

808
00:44:15.801 --> 00:44:17.720
they're not making overtime and shit like that,

809
00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:21.110
suddenly a kid runs behind the barrier and this guy was like,
fuck that kid.

810
00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:23.870
Like I'm not even getting fucking paid what I should be getting paid for this.

811
00:44:23.871 --> 00:44:27.740
Fuck that kid.
And then he tackles them and then everyone sees him.
And,
uh,

812
00:44:27.810 --> 00:44:32.010
you know,
a lot of the protesters assume,
well,
that guys is a fucking asshole.
Like

813
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:34.230
<v 4>he's the problem.
And it's like,
well,
you know,</v>

814
00:44:34.231 --> 00:44:35.790
he was on your side a couple of months ago,

815
00:44:35.791 --> 00:44:39.210
but he's getting dicked around by his fucking bosses who don't have to be out

816
00:44:39.211 --> 00:44:41.940
there and who are making way more fucking money and who were like,

817
00:44:42.210 --> 00:44:46.530
essentially career politicians,
not even fucking cops.
You know what I mean?
Uh,

818
00:44:47.130 --> 00:44:51.390
it's going to breed so much fucking resentment,
uh,
towards everyone.

819
00:44:51.391 --> 00:44:53.490
But in reality,
it's just like,
again,

820
00:44:53.491 --> 00:44:55.590
unless you're making billions of fucking dollars,

821
00:44:55.591 --> 00:44:57.960
anytime you see a protestor and you screamed,
get a job,

822
00:44:57.961 --> 00:45:00.570
even though a lot of them fucking have jobs or teachers and nurses and they're

823
00:45:00.571 --> 00:45:03.750
just not making enough money or they have a shred of fucking empathy,

824
00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:07.500
which so many people seem to lack nowadays,
uh,
when you see them as like,

825
00:45:07.530 --> 00:45:11.460
they're sticking up for you,
they want to make sure you don't fucking have to,

826
00:45:11.490 --> 00:45:14.550
you know,
suddenly start paying a shit load for,
for Medicare,

827
00:45:14.551 --> 00:45:16.170
for your grandmother,
for,
you know.

828
00:45:16.270 --> 00:45:16.470
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

829
00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:20.860
Don't putting people in a very unnatural situation and asking them to behave

830
00:45:20.861 --> 00:45:23.140
normally,
both cops and protest.

831
00:45:23.410 --> 00:45:27.250
Putting people in a situation where the cops have to listen to look.

832
00:45:27.251 --> 00:45:29.080
Not every protesters fucking smart.

833
00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:32.950
I don't know how many protestors are saying dumb shit to the cops all day.

834
00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:36.220
The cops are stuck in traffic getting over there.
Their job sucks.

835
00:45:36.370 --> 00:45:40.240
It's a dangerous fucking creepy job being the enemy folks.
It's a dangerous,

836
00:45:40.241 --> 00:45:42.700
creepy job.
Yup.
So there's just,

837
00:45:42.701 --> 00:45:46.090
it's an unnatural position that most people should not be asked to be in,

838
00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:50.590
but I completely agree that cop should be paid a fuck load of money as should

839
00:45:50.591 --> 00:45:55.360
teachers.
Those are two things that is is a sign of a sick society.

840
00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:59.680
If you look at the way we spend money on foreign wars and these I,

841
00:45:59.681 --> 00:46:04.090
this idea of policing places we're never going to fucking visit that have been

842
00:46:04.091 --> 00:46:05.680
that way for thousands of years.

843
00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:10.060
Fuck you to do that and not want to spend money on schools and not want to spend

844
00:46:10.061 --> 00:46:14.060
money on cops.
It's just indicative of how corrupt our society is.

845
00:46:14.140 --> 00:46:15.730
We have the money.

846
00:46:15.850 --> 00:46:20.850
If everybody just worked and used their resources the way that we could w w the

847
00:46:21.651 --> 00:46:24.910
way we would want them used if we used our resources in this country,

848
00:46:24.911 --> 00:46:26.980
the way that people would actually vote on,

849
00:46:26.981 --> 00:46:31.120
if we could all vote on what percentage of money should be put on national

850
00:46:31.121 --> 00:46:33.790
defense,
what percentage should be on education,
what percent?

851
00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:37.970
You would be amazed if we could decide and be amazed at how quickly things can

852
00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:39.750
change,
but what happens is the sign of corruption,

853
00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:41.560
what happens if we don't find the education system?

854
00:46:41.561 --> 00:46:42.670
They may have a shitty education.

855
00:46:42.671 --> 00:46:45.470
More people drop out and then they can join the fucking military and fighting

856
00:46:45.490 --> 00:46:49.300
these doors.
Exactly.
It makes it easier.
I mean that is,
that's the argument.

857
00:46:49.301 --> 00:46:52.660
The argument is that it's weakened on purpose in order to make sure that they're

858
00:46:52.661 --> 00:46:55.510
always have a steady supply of rubes to work for them and do their bidding.

859
00:46:56.060 --> 00:46:59.000
<v 4>Poor communities for all these people who are like,
get a fucking job.</v>

860
00:46:59.001 --> 00:46:59.990
You know all these people get a job.

861
00:46:59.991 --> 00:47:02.090
It's like because there haven't been jobs and they're fucking community.

862
00:47:02.180 --> 00:47:03.710
They can't buy produce in their community.

863
00:47:03.830 --> 00:47:06.500
They're having been jobs there for years except for fucking drug dealing.

864
00:47:06.501 --> 00:47:08.330
And their dad was arrested for drug dealing.

865
00:47:08.331 --> 00:47:11.210
So then this kid had to take care of his fucking mother,
right?

866
00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:14.240
So then he ends up drug dealing and then fucking he goes to jail and then you

867
00:47:14.241 --> 00:47:17.450
get out of jail and what you're just going to start fucking applying to Ivy

868
00:47:17.451 --> 00:47:20.390
League schools are going to look for like internships in the media business.

869
00:47:20.540 --> 00:47:23.030
Like of course you're going to fucking drug deal cause that's the only way to

870
00:47:23.031 --> 00:47:23.864
put money on your,

871
00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:27.340
<v 3>to feed your family.
People have to accept it.</v>

872
00:47:27.341 --> 00:47:30.190
Other folks get a real bad roll dice and you start

873
00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:33.130
<v 5>off on Shit Street and there's not much you can do about that.</v>

874
00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:36.210
But imitate your atmosphere in order to try to get by in life.
And that,

875
00:47:36.211 --> 00:47:39.670
that is a lot of our problem in this world.
It is not the,

876
00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:41.830
the children that are committing crimes under the problem.

877
00:47:42.070 --> 00:47:45.460
It's how these children get into this position where they can commit crimes.

878
00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:46.990
What the fuck is going on?
Well,

879
00:47:46.991 --> 00:47:51.430
what's going on is there's a shit education and there's a fucking shit community

880
00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:54.490
and there's a bunch of people that are constantly involved in crime.

881
00:47:54.491 --> 00:47:57.580
And that is the roll of the dice.
These poor people got,
well,

882
00:47:57.581 --> 00:48:02.581
we have to figure out as a society is how to improve the weakest areas of our

883
00:48:02.681 --> 00:48:03.311
foundation.

884
00:48:03.311 --> 00:48:07.090
The weakest areas of our structure and the weakest area clearly are the areas of

885
00:48:07.091 --> 00:48:09.880
impoverished people that are filled with crime.
We need to fix those.

886
00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:11.890
And if till until you fix those,

887
00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:15.880
you're not really trying to make a better America.
You're just being an asshole.

888
00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:20.680
You're just wasting our tax dollars doing shit that corporations want you to do

889
00:48:20.681 --> 00:48:24.070
because they've paid you.
And that's how they got you in the office.
The,

890
00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:27.850
the heads of these corporations are paying less in taxes than all of your

891
00:48:27.851 --> 00:48:32.290
listeners are.
Yeah.
And,
and that's what's so crazy is they say,
well,
I did this.

892
00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:35.140
It was the free market,
the government to make this job.
Right?
But it's like,

893
00:48:35.141 --> 00:48:37.960
right,
but they paid for the road you took to get there.

894
00:48:38.050 --> 00:48:42.100
They paid for the police that protected your corporation from being robbed.

895
00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:46.210
They pay for,
you know,
maybe your kids went to public school,
but I doubt it.
Uh,

896
00:48:46.211 --> 00:48:49.930
but park,
I mean,
here's the,
here's the real issue that people have,

897
00:48:49.931 --> 00:48:53.470
the people that don't want to pay more taxes.
Here's the issue that people have.

898
00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:54.940
They,
the number one,

899
00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:59.380
the most prevalent point is they don't want lazy people to get free money.

900
00:48:59.650 --> 00:49:02.170
That is,
it isn't it?
And that is a real point.

901
00:49:02.350 --> 00:49:05.110
And that's being ignored by the left and to a certain extent,

902
00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:09.880
because we really do have to look at the welfare mindset because it is a

903
00:49:09.881 --> 00:49:13.390
terrible psychological mindset.
Compare the,

904
00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:17.050
the people you're describing are out there for sure.

905
00:49:17.350 --> 00:49:21.760
There's a lot of on hail in comparison to the amount of kids you were just

906
00:49:21.761 --> 00:49:25.120
talking about.
Uh,
who are the ones who are born into poverty?

907
00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:28.180
And I mean,
here's what I completely agree,

908
00:49:28.181 --> 00:49:32.200
but I don't think that money just pushing money in their hands is the way to

909
00:49:32.201 --> 00:49:35.600
handle it.
No.
But I mean there were people to lazy way of approaching,
but there,

910
00:49:35.660 --> 00:49:38.530
but at the same time it's,
you know,
there was a strike.
Look,

911
00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:43.630
you lose your job for example,
right?
You lose your job,
you lose your benefits.

912
00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:46.750
Right?
Um,
back before the affordable care act,

913
00:49:46.751 --> 00:49:49.410
which I have problems with again for hurting him three [inaudible],
uh,

914
00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:52.570
before the affordable care act,
you couldn't really get health insurance if,

915
00:49:52.571 --> 00:49:54.640
let's say you were sick,
I said you had cancer,
right?

916
00:49:54.641 --> 00:49:58.180
Because that was a preexisting condition.
So now you got fired.

917
00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:00.940
You're not getting any money.
Or maybe even if you are getting welfare money,

918
00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:04.840
but now suddenly you have to pay for your own fucking cancer treatment.

919
00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:06.910
And so then what happens when it doesn't have insurance?

920
00:50:06.911 --> 00:50:10.770
So then he goes to the hospital,
they have to see him and if he can't be,

921
00:50:10.780 --> 00:50:12.940
can pay than the hospital pays for it.

922
00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:15.400
And that like we're just losing more and more money.

923
00:50:15.850 --> 00:50:17.800
Here's the issue with what you just brought up.

924
00:50:17.801 --> 00:50:20.980
You just brought up an artificial scenario.
I can bring you up another one.

925
00:50:20.981 --> 00:50:23.850
So there's a woman,
she never worked.
She keeps having children.

926
00:50:23.870 --> 00:50:26.920
The more children she has,
the more money she gets.
Her kids all become criminals.

927
00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:28.070
No,
they're all being,

928
00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:28.903
<v 1>me and my wife,</v>

929
00:50:29.810 --> 00:50:32.960
they're all being raised by idiots in a terrible environment and everyone's on

930
00:50:32.961 --> 00:50:35.900
welfare and food stamps and people don't want their money to continue to go to

931
00:50:35.901 --> 00:50:39.120
that.
There's that too.
There's that that you're looking at welfare,

932
00:50:39.170 --> 00:50:41.360
sponsoring a credible organization where it's like,

933
00:50:41.361 --> 00:50:45.740
but I don't necessarily think that sending them a check is the way to do it.

934
00:50:46.190 --> 00:50:49.040
I'm not saying that they don't deserve attention.
They most certainly do.

935
00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:51.440
I have always said,
and I say it on this podcast all the time,

936
00:50:51.441 --> 00:50:53.360
that if you want to make the country a better place,

937
00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:56.690
the first thing you got to do is make sure there's less losers.

938
00:50:56.930 --> 00:50:59.090
So you have to find children and give them hope.

939
00:50:59.270 --> 00:51:03.260
And so you've got to give a kid who you know has got a shit,

940
00:51:03.261 --> 00:51:05.090
roll the dice and give them an opportunity.

941
00:51:05.091 --> 00:51:10.010
And I think there's plenty of people and plenty of resources to accomplish that.

942
00:51:10.010 --> 00:51:12.440
And I think it should be our number one goal as Americans.

943
00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:16.670
If we really truly consider this a tribe and we really are a tribe of 300

944
00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:19.430
million people,
we can't ignore the shittiest part of the tribe.

945
00:51:19.490 --> 00:51:21.470
Now money is not the answer.

946
00:51:21.590 --> 00:51:26.590
Spending money on programs in education and having community centers or giving

947
00:51:26.931 --> 00:51:29.240
them a sense of community,
building up a sense of community,

948
00:51:29.241 --> 00:51:31.760
making sure that everyone has food.
Yeah.
Okay.

949
00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:34.820
Make taking that out of the equation so people don't have to worry about fucking

950
00:51:34.821 --> 00:51:38.780
starving to death.
I'm 100% for that,
but just giving them a check.
I don't,

951
00:51:38.781 --> 00:51:39.531
I don't agree with that.

952
00:51:39.531 --> 00:51:42.980
I think maybe we should set up places where they can all like community centers

953
00:51:42.981 --> 00:51:46.520
where anyone can eat at anytime [inaudible] centers and stuff like that.

954
00:51:46.521 --> 00:51:48.050
But I got want education.
I want,

955
00:51:48.051 --> 00:51:50.870
I want a place where you can go there and there's a boxing coach.
You go,

956
00:51:50.871 --> 00:51:53.210
there's a,
there's a go could teach you Jujitsu.
You know,

957
00:51:53.211 --> 00:51:57.280
like where kids can have something where they can have a positive,
uh,

958
00:51:57.420 --> 00:52:01.970
a place to put their energy and you could develop good human beings.
I mean,

959
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:03.770
we are,
we are on the same page.

960
00:52:04.210 --> 00:52:06.710
Actually on the same page of helping people that need help,

961
00:52:06.860 --> 00:52:10.100
especially people that just got unfortunate and people that are sick.

962
00:52:10.101 --> 00:52:13.640
I'm 100% I think that should be again,

963
00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:18.650
a part of a tribe,
but don't get all of my friends.
Okay.
In My,
uh,
you know,

964
00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:20.950
what are we call death squad are immediate.
If it,

965
00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:24.350
if any one of my friends was ever in a situation where they needed money for

966
00:52:24.351 --> 00:52:28.370
anything and I have that money,
I would,
I would spend it immediate,

967
00:52:28.371 --> 00:52:32.110
this is why I came here today.
But you know what I'm saying?
Real proposals.

968
00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:33.473
But you know what I'm saying?

969
00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:37.520
That's how we should feel as a community 100 when we have,

970
00:52:38.450 --> 00:52:39.830
when we have an issue like the,
you know,

971
00:52:39.831 --> 00:52:43.410
the issue with this comic who was hurt in the Aurora shooting house.
Yay.

972
00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:45.700
The comic community is rallied around,
they started,

973
00:52:45.730 --> 00:52:48.410
they're doing a bunch of benefits for this kid and it's great.
Yeah.
And they're,

974
00:52:48.460 --> 00:52:51.110
they're donating money to his family and it's beautiful.

975
00:52:51.230 --> 00:52:54.080
And I mostly do that on a,
on a large scale.

976
00:52:54.770 --> 00:52:58.580
I think she can she answer because yeah,
of course.
You did,
you just like,

977
00:52:58.690 --> 00:53:02.600
you're not told,
you know,
you're not supposed to give,
uh,
uh,

978
00:53:02.630 --> 00:53:04.920
homeless like alcoholics money,
so they don't buy alcohol.

979
00:53:04.940 --> 00:53:06.860
You're supposed to take them to a shelter or call a shelter.

980
00:53:06.890 --> 00:53:09.950
Don't give a man a fish.
I do agree.
Don't,
uh,

981
00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:12.980
you don't want those lazy people are getting checks or kettle bells as we

982
00:53:12.981 --> 00:53:14.450
discussed earlier.
Well,
we need,

983
00:53:14.451 --> 00:53:19.451
dude is a shift in the way human beings approach each other the way we're

984
00:53:19.790 --> 00:53:24.050
taught.
We can approach each other and the way that will benefit us.
Yeah,

985
00:53:24.060 --> 00:53:26.460
totally individual.
I think that's why occupy

986
00:53:26.490 --> 00:53:28.770
<v 4>got so popular because,
you know,</v>

987
00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:32.550
it wasn't just resentment because you're wealthy.
You know what I mean?

988
00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:36.390
I think like Cheo had that quote where he was saying that like,
liberals don't,

989
00:53:36.450 --> 00:53:37.283
uh,

990
00:53:37.350 --> 00:53:42.270
liberals don't like they something like they hate wealthy people.

991
00:53:42.271 --> 00:53:45.540
It wasn't like,
you know,
that it made it more of like,
oh,
we're jealous.

992
00:53:45.541 --> 00:53:47.520
We just don't like you for being rich.
That's bullshit.

993
00:53:47.521 --> 00:53:50.970
If you get rich ethically good for you,
like that's great.

994
00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:54.990
You save that and that's nice and you have a very good point of view.
However,

995
00:53:54.991 --> 00:53:58.110
there's a lot of morons who adopted the,
if you're rich,

996
00:53:58.111 --> 00:54:01.380
you did it off the backs of people we had.
I mean we had,

997
00:54:01.850 --> 00:54:03.580
I've faced it as an entertainer.

998
00:54:03.710 --> 00:54:06.600
I know everything I've done is just tried to make people,

999
00:54:06.601 --> 00:54:07.800
I mean everybody I do for money,

1000
00:54:07.801 --> 00:54:09.990
I'm trying to make people the lab trying to explain to you just,

1001
00:54:09.991 --> 00:54:11.920
I mean I'm not hurting anybody,
but yeah,

1002
00:54:11.930 --> 00:54:15.770
people would be upset at me personally because I've made money.
I had,

1003
00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:19.190
I had a couple of people that argument,
I had a couple of people who,
um,

1004
00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:21.810
and then I'll get to the positive point,
but I had a couple of people who,

1005
00:54:21.811 --> 00:54:23.080
and this is right.
I mean we have,
you know,

1006
00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:26.070
tens of thousands of liberal kids who listened to us and maybe this was like

1007
00:54:26.071 --> 00:54:26.970
four or five tweets,

1008
00:54:26.971 --> 00:54:29.670
but there was so obnoxious that those are the ones I fucking focused on.

1009
00:54:29.730 --> 00:54:33.960
Of course I did Conan,
uh,
which have not been invited back.

1010
00:54:34.110 --> 00:54:36.630
I talked about drone strikes,
criticized Obama,

1011
00:54:36.810 --> 00:54:40.530
and on the same episode like I was like,
I wonder why they got so much hate mail.

1012
00:54:40.650 --> 00:54:41.850
And then like the other guests,

1013
00:54:41.851 --> 00:54:44.730
it was like something like child star and like Coby Bryant.
And I was like,
oh,

1014
00:54:44.731 --> 00:54:48.120
that makes sense.
That's not really my crowd.
Uh,
and so,
you know,

1015
00:54:48.121 --> 00:54:51.720
talking about drone strikes did literally everything I could to make it like as

1016
00:54:51.721 --> 00:54:56.370
different and edgy,
like just walk the fucking line as close as I could.
And uh,

1017
00:54:56.730 --> 00:54:58.590
someone immediately was like,
Yo Bro,

1018
00:54:58.591 --> 00:55:01.560
like TBS zoned by this like giant corporation.
And I'm like,

1019
00:55:01.830 --> 00:55:05.190
go fuck yourself and die.
Like,
what am I supposed to do?
Like there,

1020
00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:08.460
there are occasion there are going to be there like left of left miserable

1021
00:55:08.461 --> 00:55:10.020
people who wouldn't be happy unless it was like,

1022
00:55:10.021 --> 00:55:13.140
this is citizen radio live from a box in an alley.
Uh,

1023
00:55:13.141 --> 00:55:16.560
someone please bring me food.
I'm really hungry.
Uh,
and then they'd be like,

1024
00:55:16.561 --> 00:55:20.790
yeah man,
like Che Guevara sold out yet,
which get an apartment.

1025
00:55:20.791 --> 00:55:24.210
You fucking sell out around carbon in the backs of your listeners.

1026
00:55:25.050 --> 00:55:28.800
Would I send you money?
So you talk and now you get a fucking apartment.
Dude,

1027
00:55:28.801 --> 00:55:32.400
really,
I want you to broadcasting from the emergency room for emergency care.

1028
00:55:32.900 --> 00:55:35.190
But I used to believe in you.
That's one of my favorite ones.

1029
00:55:35.191 --> 00:55:39.930
What they used to believe in and out that shit is you went to a subscription

1030
00:55:39.931 --> 00:55:44.340
model,
Jamie Kilstein you fucking shoulder.
We have it as a thing.
I'm like,
dude,

1031
00:55:44.341 --> 00:55:47.790
we have made every terrible business decision to not sell out like every
mistake.

1032
00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:51.300
We should be homeless a thousand times over.
We still out this shit we love.

1033
00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:56.550
Well and that's the flashlights we sell out to on it.
Yeah,
we had one,

1034
00:55:56.580 --> 00:55:59.460
we had one sponsor like back in the day that we really like legitimately

1035
00:55:59.461 --> 00:56:01.350
supported and like bought shit from.
So we were like sure.

1036
00:56:01.380 --> 00:56:03.180
And of course because they were ethical,
they were like,

1037
00:56:03.181 --> 00:56:05.460
we can't afford to pay her anymore.
And I was like right on.
You know,

1038
00:56:05.461 --> 00:56:06.211
we were going back,

1039
00:56:06.211 --> 00:56:09.780
we were talking about the difference between the silent protest being so creepy

1040
00:56:09.781 --> 00:56:12.420
and throwing glitter on people.
Yeah.
And I did want to say,

1041
00:56:12.421 --> 00:56:13.370
I didn't want to stop your rant,

1042
00:56:13.371 --> 00:56:16.260
but I did want to say that I fucking love when they throw glitter on people.

1043
00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:20.280
Have you seen the Tom Freeman pie?
No,
I don't like pies,
pies or rude,

1044
00:56:20.460 --> 00:56:24.010
but glitter on undercover gay dudes who are mean to other gay dudes.

1045
00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:26.590
<v 3>And that shit is beautiful.
Marcus Bachmann,
man,</v>

1046
00:56:26.591 --> 00:56:27.850
when they glitter Marcus Bachmann,

1047
00:56:27.851 --> 00:56:30.940
I've been going back and forth on Twitter with the dudes who do it and they send

1048
00:56:30.941 --> 00:56:33.400
me tweets and emails whenever they catch it and they throw glitter on them.

1049
00:56:33.550 --> 00:56:35.760
They showed up at his place and trust his barberry.

1050
00:56:37.590 --> 00:56:39.940
<v 4>And I fucking love that.
I love that</v>

1051
00:56:40.740 --> 00:56:42.900
<v 3>man.
If you don't know who he is,
is his wife,</v>

1052
00:56:42.901 --> 00:56:46.470
Michele Bachmann is at one point in time was somehow or another they thought

1053
00:56:46.471 --> 00:56:50.520
that she was going to be like Sarah Palin type character only even nuttier and

1054
00:56:50.521 --> 00:56:52.920
they were going to try that out.
But we're not ready for this yet.

1055
00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:54.750
We're not ready for a lady who,

1056
00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:57.420
not only is he probably thinks the earth is 10,000 years old,

1057
00:56:57.630 --> 00:56:59.460
but has a fucking gay husband.

1058
00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:03.480
<v 4>Well,
they have one of those gay,
uh,
like conversion camps that,
yeah,</v>

1059
00:57:03.481 --> 00:57:05.580
he runs a prey,
which by the way,

1060
00:57:05.581 --> 00:57:09.570
it's like if you're a gay dude and you're looking to pick up guys,
that's great.

1061
00:57:09.800 --> 00:57:12.440
<v 3>Yeah.
Like I pray the gay way camp,
they did one of them,</v>

1062
00:57:12.441 --> 00:57:16.940
it was New York Times or Vanity Fair did a,
um,
uh,
an undercover sort of a thing.

1063
00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:19.190
Oh yeah.
There.
And they're all like,

1064
00:57:19.220 --> 00:57:23.000
guys are hugging you from behind with their boners pressed into your ass.

1065
00:57:23.030 --> 00:57:27.520
No bullshit.
And they're praying the gay away.
And,
uh,
so these guys,
uh,

1066
00:57:27.521 --> 00:57:29.750
I don't remember the name of the group.
I apologize,

1067
00:57:29.751 --> 00:57:31.100
but I thought it was fucking awesome.

1068
00:57:31.101 --> 00:57:35.960
A bunch of proud gay guys just showed up at Marcus Bachmann's pray the gay away

1069
00:57:35.961 --> 00:57:37.870
place,
dressed as barbaric.

1070
00:57:38.750 --> 00:57:41.270
And then Lynn throwing glitter on them whenever they see them.

1071
00:57:41.271 --> 00:57:44.620
I think that's fucking awesome.
It's,
it's,

1072
00:57:44.630 --> 00:57:48.980
it's a high time that that becomes ridiculous.
The two kids that,
um,

1073
00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:52.740
<v 4>uh,
stood up and made out at the two guys who had a,</v>

1074
00:57:52.770 --> 00:57:56.250
the Rick Santorum rally came to my show in Chicago and uh,

1075
00:57:56.251 --> 00:57:57.450
apparently they didn't plan it.

1076
00:57:57.480 --> 00:57:59.490
They just like went like ironically to the Rick Santorum,

1077
00:57:59.491 --> 00:58:03.210
Riley and what was so with a gay couple,

1078
00:58:03.211 --> 00:58:06.770
it wouldn't be a real protest if they weren't good on that either way.

1079
00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:10.950
It just starts sucking each other's do you Santoro your rig?
Check this out,

1080
00:58:11.580 --> 00:58:15.600
hail Satan.
But here's what was so funny,
my favorite part about that was,

1081
00:58:15.601 --> 00:58:17.970
so they're,
they're like big,
they look like hockey players.

1082
00:58:18.100 --> 00:58:20.850
So like they stood up and I was like,
I was like,
are these dudes going to brawl?

1083
00:58:20.851 --> 00:58:24.120
Like they were just like these bearded and so they,

1084
00:58:24.690 --> 00:58:28.890
so they stand up and they start making out and like the audience,

1085
00:58:28.891 --> 00:58:31.140
you hear the audience at first they're like,
oh,

1086
00:58:33.180 --> 00:58:34.950
they progressively got more clear.

1087
00:58:35.250 --> 00:58:37.500
But then my favorite part is because it was republicans,

1088
00:58:37.501 --> 00:58:42.150
they didn't know what else to do so they just turned chanting USA,
USA,

1089
00:58:42.300 --> 00:58:43.950
which doesn't even make sense.
Like it looks like.

1090
00:58:43.951 --> 00:58:45.750
So essentially all you see is a Rick Santorum rally,

1091
00:58:45.751 --> 00:58:48.980
two dudes making out and it looks like everyone is rallying behind and punk and

1092
00:58:48.990 --> 00:58:53.990
like America and then a hilarious took a Rick Santorum poster from the rally.

1093
00:58:56.191 --> 00:58:57.390
I made them sign it for us

1094
00:58:57.800 --> 00:59:02.360
<v 3>video of them chanting USA while those guys are killing be awesome.</v>

1095
00:59:02.390 --> 00:59:06.500
It's the funniest thing.
They should have that for like gay America.

1096
00:59:06.860 --> 00:59:11.070
They should have the extent or just show them kissing.
No better.

1097
00:59:15.270 --> 00:59:16.103
<v 0>Yes sir.</v>

1098
00:59:21.010 --> 00:59:26.010
[inaudible] oh,

1099
00:59:26.881 --> 00:59:29.150
they already contained USA.

1100
00:59:31.860 --> 00:59:33.930
What a dumb Chan USA.

1101
00:59:33.940 --> 00:59:37.630
<v 4>This is USA.
You fuckhead USA is gay people too.</v>

1102
00:59:37.660 --> 00:59:39.890
That is so down Sarah.
But that's what,

1103
00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:43.180
that's what they do when they panic is just like,
we'll cut.
We'll cut through.

1104
00:59:43.181 --> 00:59:44.890
Where are we going again?
Right?
USA.
Yeah.

1105
00:59:44.980 --> 00:59:46.900
Let's just all be as dumb as possible you,

1106
00:59:47.580 --> 00:59:50.260
which just break it down to some letters and we all agree we're on the same
team.

1107
00:59:50.261 --> 00:59:51.250
Okay,
where did he go?

1108
00:59:51.940 --> 00:59:53.140
<v 1>What does that even mean?</v>

1109
00:59:53.320 --> 00:59:56.950
You can't interrupt a dummy who wants to be king by kissing.

1110
00:59:58.090 --> 01:00:00.610
You can't.
You can't interrupt a dummy.

1111
01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:05.470
A silly dummy that has no right running the world.
No,
no,

1112
01:00:05.471 --> 01:00:09.760
you crazy asshole who believes in old,
ancient stupid shit.

1113
01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.170
Now you can't run things.

1114
01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:15.210
<v 4>Uh,
and then here comes a kiss that blows my mind.
I was like,</v>

1115
01:00:15.211 --> 01:00:18.750
religion is the one thing where like you don't need evidence and it'd be one

1116
01:00:18.751 --> 01:00:23.730
thing of like you just like,
like I'm an atheist and like when I first read,

1117
01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:26.370
uh,
you know,
the big atheist books and stuff,

1118
01:00:26.371 --> 01:00:30.370
there was part of me that didn't want to go around and like,
I dunno,

1119
01:00:30.380 --> 01:00:33.030
there was part of you like when you first read something that you had no idea

1120
01:00:33.031 --> 01:00:33.841
and you're like,
fuck man,

1121
01:00:33.841 --> 01:00:36.990
I've been lied to for so long that you do want to take it to an extreme where

1122
01:00:36.991 --> 01:00:39.930
like if you see a kid who was like,
merry Christmas,
be like fuck you,

1123
01:00:39.931 --> 01:00:42.330
there's no Christmas idiot and like kick them over and be like,

1124
01:00:42.331 --> 01:00:43.800
read Christopher Hitchens asshole.

1125
01:00:43.890 --> 01:00:47.910
But like then once you kind of calm down and you know,

1126
01:00:49.590 --> 01:00:50.423
you,

1127
01:00:50.430 --> 01:00:53.610
if people are going to be religious and let's say not hurt people or just cause

1128
01:00:53.611 --> 01:00:56.910
they believe in something and it makes them happier,
it makes them feel whole.

1129
01:00:56.911 --> 01:00:58.410
Like that's fine,
that's fine with me.

1130
01:00:58.950 --> 01:01:03.240
But the fact that you can make policy without proving there's a Jesus without

1131
01:01:03.241 --> 01:01:08.241
proving there's a god you can make policy that hurts actual people like we're

1132
01:01:09.601 --> 01:01:14.070
not positive about Jesus,
I'm positive are due to suck cock positive,
positive.

1133
01:01:14.071 --> 01:01:17.430
Their girls like Plessy seeing pictures of it.
There's evidence,

1134
01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:21.510
there's no picture of fucking Jesus.
There's absolutely a picture of girls eating

1135
01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:26.650
<v 1>mom,
mom,
mom,
mom,
mom
that uh,</v>

1136
01:01:27.430 --> 01:01:27.911
well it's,

1137
01:01:27.911 --> 01:01:31.720
it's ridiculous that anybody should be able to ever enforce any behavior

1138
01:01:31.721 --> 01:01:34.570
patterns on anybody else.
If,
if their choice behavior patterns,

1139
01:01:34.810 --> 01:01:36.670
if those behavior patterns don't hurt other people.

1140
01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:39.700
If your behavior patterns or you like to push people into the street,
well yeah,

1141
01:01:39.701 --> 01:01:41.470
we should fucking vet should be eliminated.

1142
01:01:41.471 --> 01:01:43.690
What if you're going to be all going off nom nom nom?

1143
01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:45.580
Well maybe it'd be funny that way.
I don't know.

1144
01:01:45.581 --> 01:01:46.980
It depends on what you're pushing in the street and we are,

1145
01:01:46.981 --> 01:01:51.070
if you're pushing people who are assholes right while while making that noise so

1146
01:01:51.071 --> 01:01:52.690
you're doing something good and you're being kind of funny.

1147
01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:57.100
The pussy eating punisher and I'll push,
I don't get it the fuck am I saying?

1148
01:01:57.780 --> 01:02:00.040
Um,
it's just we,
we,
we have to,

1149
01:02:00.041 --> 01:02:04.840
I think we have to look at our model of human behavior and we have to change it.

1150
01:02:05.220 --> 01:02:07.660
You know,
my um,

1151
01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:10.990
I had a revelation and it became like a bit that's in my act now,

1152
01:02:11.230 --> 01:02:14.350
but it really did.
I really did have this revelation on a,

1153
01:02:14.410 --> 01:02:18.070
on a boat looking at some dolphins and there was thinking of like how smart

1154
01:02:18.071 --> 01:02:19.980
dolphins are and what is it

1155
01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:22.500
<v 6>like to be a dolphin,
dolphin consciousness.</v>

1156
01:02:22.501 --> 01:02:24.550
I was thinking how strange it is if it like being a dolphin,

1157
01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:27.570
like the way he thinks of himself as exactly the way I think of myself.

1158
01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:29.190
We're just trapped in different worlds.

1159
01:02:29.340 --> 01:02:32.310
I can manipulate things with my fingers and he has to kill things with his face.

1160
01:02:32.910 --> 01:02:36.630
And I thought about like what would it,
would I be him if I was a dolphin?

1161
01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:38.970
And then I thought about people and I was like,
wow,
fuck,

1162
01:02:38.971 --> 01:02:43.260
would it be if we are literally all the same thing and that we're looking at

1163
01:02:43.261 --> 01:02:45.750
ourselves through different life experiences,

1164
01:02:45.751 --> 01:02:48.360
we're looking at ourselves with different genetics.
But at the,

1165
01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:52.740
if you were that little kid with cerebral palsy,
you would be him.

1166
01:02:52.741 --> 01:02:54.300
If you lived his life,
you were born him.

1167
01:02:54.301 --> 01:02:56.700
You would be him and if he lived your life he would be you.

1168
01:02:57.030 --> 01:03:00.360
And that it's like we are just a unique combination of hormones and life

1169
01:03:00.361 --> 01:03:03.900
experiences combined with a soul and the entity,
the consciousness,

1170
01:03:03.901 --> 01:03:04.940
the whatever the fuck it is,
right?

1171
01:03:05.020 --> 01:03:07.050
It has to go through life and make the decisions.

1172
01:03:07.290 --> 01:03:12.290
And how crazy would it be if we could realize that we can be happy if we treat

1173
01:03:13.530 --> 01:03:14.430
everybody,

1174
01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:19.080
that we meet everybody that we deal with as if it's us living another life.

1175
01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:23.790
And that doesn't mean no competition.
That doesn't mean no innovation.

1176
01:03:23.791 --> 01:03:27.450
That doesn't mean no competition as far as capitalism.
It doesn't mean,
you know,

1177
01:03:27.451 --> 01:03:27.611
we,

1178
01:03:27.611 --> 01:03:32.030
we have to rely on some ridiculous commune system where nobody has any rewards.

1179
01:03:32.031 --> 01:03:35.760
The symptoms start off just,
yeah,
just don't be a fucking piece of shit.

1180
01:03:35.790 --> 01:03:40.290
Don't open by being an ass.
Treat the world as if it's you,
you know,
that is,

1181
01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:44.940
I swear to God,
I think that's possible.
I think if you do good work in,
you know,

1182
01:03:45.140 --> 01:03:48.420
as long as we have a real economy,
if we have a real market,
if we have,

1183
01:03:48.630 --> 01:03:52.390
we really do manufacture things and create things that have merit and we,

1184
01:03:52.410 --> 01:03:54.690
if we're really configure that out,
if that's possible.

1185
01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:58.230
And that's what makes it a little trickier because I,

1186
01:03:58.410 --> 01:04:01.500
I'm not sure if we can really run a society like this without being corrupt.

1187
01:04:01.530 --> 01:04:04.020
Well,
the,
you know,
the problem is it's like,

1188
01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:08.370
I really don't think that the majority of Americans are like racist,

1189
01:04:08.371 --> 01:04:13.050
homophobic pieces of shit.
But a point that Alison writes about a lot is,

1190
01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:15.570
you know,
in times of economic struggle,

1191
01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:20.190
that's when you see harsher,
uh,
immigration laws come down.

1192
01:04:20.191 --> 01:04:21.480
That's when you see more homophobia.

1193
01:04:21.510 --> 01:04:24.120
That's where we see more violence because it's always this other,
right?

1194
01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:26.670
Because in America you're told you can do whatever you want.

1195
01:04:26.670 --> 01:04:28.980
If you want to be a millionaire or if you want to be a successful entrepreneur,

1196
01:04:28.981 --> 01:04:32.470
you can do it and then you don't do it.
But you have some politicians,

1197
01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:36.600
I'm rich politician who has your fucking money.
You have him saying like,
well,

1198
01:04:36.601 --> 01:04:39.860
we just have too many immigrants taking their jobs are like the gays there.

1199
01:04:39.861 --> 01:04:42.440
They're angering Jesus.
And,

1200
01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:45.360
and then you start blaming these other people because you're like,
it's not me.

1201
01:04:45.510 --> 01:04:49.560
Because like there are a lot of republicans who are being fucked just like we're

1202
01:04:49.561 --> 01:04:53.520
being fucked.
Just like everyone,
independence,
whatever,
being fucked.

1203
01:04:53.790 --> 01:04:56.250
Because,
uh,

1204
01:04:57.840 --> 01:05:01.110
and the people who are actually doing the fucking are just like,
well,

1205
01:05:01.111 --> 01:05:04.020
don't look at my house.
Don't look at my mansion.
Don't look at my bank account.

1206
01:05:04.021 --> 01:05:08.220
Don't look at my fucking tax records.
It's fucking Jose over there.
And you look,

1207
01:05:08.221 --> 01:05:11.090
and it's just just like friendly Mexican dude and a pickup truck like that guys

1208
01:05:11.100 --> 01:05:13.050
going for your job.
And you're like,
well,
fuck Jose.

1209
01:05:13.230 --> 01:05:17.380
Because it's also easier to go after the immigrants than it is to overthrow our

1210
01:05:17.381 --> 01:05:18.460
broken system.

1211
01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:19.000
<v 4>Right?</v>

1212
01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:23.410
Like if you tell someone that the election was rigged or that votes are being

1213
01:05:23.411 --> 01:05:26.560
suppressed or that George Bush and when in 2000,
they're like,

1214
01:05:26.590 --> 01:05:30.730
I'm just gonna Blame Nader cause that dude's fucking old.
And that seems easier.

1215
01:05:30.731 --> 01:05:33.130
You know what I mean?
It's easier to blame like,
uh,

1216
01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:35.290
around policies are to blame a Ralph Nader,

1217
01:05:35.410 --> 01:05:38.590
then it's easier to blame an immigrant,
then it'd be like,
oh no,

1218
01:05:38.591 --> 01:05:42.700
it's all the people with all the power and all the money and all the guns and

1219
01:05:42.730 --> 01:05:47.150
the road maps to the wars.
Like they're the ones we have to like do the wheat.

1220
01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:51.880
You know,
we need a shift in,
in the identification of response.

1221
01:05:51.890 --> 01:05:54.850
Going back to where I totally agree with you is,
you know,

1222
01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:58.600
a lot of people think that like atheists are like these like weird,
immoral,

1223
01:05:58.601 --> 01:06:01.780
like we're just like,
but fucking,
I'm worshiping the devil.
Wait a minute.

1224
01:06:01.810 --> 01:06:05.410
You know what I mean?
That's like a Tuesday thing,
but not like all we got to,

1225
01:06:05.411 --> 01:06:09.550
you got arrest.
Uh,
on Wednesdays been fuck while you sing,
shout you,

1226
01:06:09.551 --> 01:06:12.160
but fuck you bought fuck on Tuesday while you praised the devil.

1227
01:06:12.161 --> 01:06:14.380
And then Wednesday like Jesus,
it's like,

1228
01:06:14.381 --> 01:06:18.730
and then he rested or like that gives me great happiness knowing that for sure

1229
01:06:18.850 --> 01:06:23.590
some do to have butt fucked while singing,
shout at the devil shout,
shout,

1230
01:06:23.830 --> 01:06:27.340
no doubt about it.
Or they're doing or they're like,
the podcast is over,

1231
01:06:27.341 --> 01:06:30.790
we have to do this,
they're going to crank it and bud fuck,
fuck or,

1232
01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:34.240
and it's going to be like one of the best days of their life.
Yeah.
There's a,

1233
01:06:34.241 --> 01:06:38.980
there's a problem with people trying to stop other people from doing shit and,

1234
01:06:39.300 --> 01:06:43.360
and,
and you know where that comes from.
It's like fear.
Who's always the Dickhead,

1235
01:06:43.361 --> 01:06:47.690
who's going hard,
like way too hard and aggressive,
uh,
against smaller people.

1236
01:06:47.780 --> 01:06:49.480
Jujitsu with the dude just sucks.
Did Jujitsu,

1237
01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:54.490
who's always the comic who when you get to the club he's automatically like,

1238
01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:58.900
just like,
hey a,
it's a gay shirt.
You got the,
where's your wife?
Probably fucking,

1239
01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:02.490
he was like,
who the fuck are you and was this Shitty Mc two that is right.

1240
01:07:02.530 --> 01:07:05.380
And then you know,
I mean that always happens where it's like the more,

1241
01:07:05.710 --> 01:07:07.120
the more of an equal you have because look,

1242
01:07:07.270 --> 01:07:11.200
if you look at a statistically we're not handling this marriage thing well this

1243
01:07:11.201 --> 01:07:16.201
thing that we claim is like show fucking like sanctimonious and you know,

1244
01:07:16.490 --> 01:07:19.210
marriage is one of the institutions of America,
the war.

1245
01:07:19.211 --> 01:07:20.890
The majority of people get fucking divorced.

1246
01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:24.820
So obviously we're not doing it right,
but it's that same fucking ego,
right?

1247
01:07:24.821 --> 01:07:25.241
Well it's like,
well,

1248
01:07:25.241 --> 01:07:28.360
I'm not happy so I don't want that fucking gay mother singing and heavy metal

1249
01:07:28.361 --> 01:07:32.840
and I was fucking marriage.
Okay.
You have to know to call the phone.
You know,

1250
01:07:33.140 --> 01:07:37.660
marriage is between a man and a man and a woman.
You have to be miserable.

1251
01:07:37.900 --> 01:07:39.610
You have to surrender all your dreams.

1252
01:07:39.611 --> 01:07:44.110
You have to hate your fucking spite kids that you had miserable that doesn't see

1253
01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:48.190
it.
No,
I'm saying
what I'm saying.

1254
01:07:48.191 --> 01:07:51.130
Those motherfuckers are so miserable.
The ones that have miserable marriages.

1255
01:07:51.131 --> 01:07:52.720
I'm not saying it's,
it's an I have a very happy,

1256
01:07:52.721 --> 01:07:54.700
and if you really love marriage and you really,

1257
01:07:54.701 --> 01:07:59.320
if you really are upset at someone making marriage less than it should be,

1258
01:07:59.321 --> 01:08:02.980
why don't you attack those fucking drive through places in Vegas?

1259
01:08:02.981 --> 01:08:06.370
We get married by Elvis.
That seems ridiculous.
I mean,

1260
01:08:06.371 --> 01:08:09.250
if you want to talk about like not taking a commitment seriously,

1261
01:08:09.430 --> 01:08:13.030
the fact that you could do it drunk,
but then you have a monogamous gay couple,

1262
01:08:13.031 --> 01:08:15.680
the two together for 10 years and have a kid and they can't get married.

1263
01:08:15.681 --> 01:08:16.040
So if one

1264
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:19.340
<v 5>of them fucking is dying,
the other one can't see him in the hospital bed.</v>

1265
01:08:19.341 --> 01:08:20.960
But that goes back to the home,
be right.

1266
01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:24.500
That goes back to just not being a dick because again,

1267
01:08:24.540 --> 01:08:28.190
it was the idea that there's something wrong with that guy because he likes

1268
01:08:28.191 --> 01:08:30.290
something different than you.
Then you like,

1269
01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:34.940
it's so stupid and it's something that is,
by the way,
a weakness.

1270
01:08:35.180 --> 01:08:37.040
And if you're a fucking man,
you want around,

1271
01:08:37.041 --> 01:08:40.820
run around thinking you're a some sort of a bad ass and you can't understand

1272
01:08:40.821 --> 01:08:45.170
that someone can have different desires than you,
then you're a pussy,

1273
01:08:45.171 --> 01:08:47.300
you're weak or you're confused,

1274
01:08:47.301 --> 01:08:49.250
you're sad or you probably get where you're hiding.

1275
01:08:49.251 --> 01:08:52.700
Some shit could be some gay shit going on in your past.
Oh,
American beauty,

1276
01:08:52.701 --> 01:08:56.750
stabbing and garage always said that there's two types of due to want to stop

1277
01:08:56.751 --> 01:08:57.410
gay marriage.

1278
01:08:57.410 --> 01:09:01.340
This really dumb people and people that are secretly worried that Dick's are

1279
01:09:01.341 --> 01:09:04.310
delicious.
Really,
really gay people.
It's true.
They're just,

1280
01:09:04.311 --> 01:09:07.430
they just fucking crib like this chicken guy that's Chick-Filet guy,

1281
01:09:07.700 --> 01:09:11.300
he's spending millions of dollars to stop gay marriage.

1282
01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:16.070
I guarantee there's some cock in his past,
I guarantee.

1283
01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:18.230
And it is not the good kind of county.
The roots,

1284
01:09:18.540 --> 01:09:22.580
it has dark calm thing has happened to him.
Even dark,
evil,
not blind.

1285
01:09:23.090 --> 01:09:28.090
Either he was molested or he did some molesting or he likes to go to row road

1286
01:09:29.631 --> 01:09:34.310
stops because that's the thing is like when like people,
so I,

1287
01:09:34.311 --> 01:09:37.130
you know,
maybe not.
I'm going to just be talking shit and was something old,

1288
01:09:37.131 --> 01:09:41.690
crazy rich dude spends money probably there.
There has been,

1289
01:09:41.750 --> 01:09:46.250
uh,
there has been a,
a dick in his past.
You think so?
I mean I would,

1290
01:09:46.340 --> 01:09:49.940
I would say if you had to go to Vegas and you had to look at a good like line,

1291
01:09:49.970 --> 01:09:50.770
you know,

1292
01:09:50.770 --> 01:09:54.710
I think I would say the Vegas line would be that he's getting is probably had

1293
01:09:54.711 --> 01:09:59.060
his dick sucked by a lot of crying and deck second.
Uh,

1294
01:09:59.150 --> 01:10:00.590
so because here's the thing,

1295
01:10:00.591 --> 01:10:04.460
like there are political issues that I can disagree with people on,
but like,

1296
01:10:04.461 --> 01:10:05.181
even though I disagree with them,

1297
01:10:05.181 --> 01:10:08.540
like I see where they're coming from where it's like,
okay,
torture.

1298
01:10:08.541 --> 01:10:12.860
You think that produces a good result and you want to protect people who may not

1299
01:10:12.861 --> 01:10:16.190
be criminals.
Got It.
Like the war,
like you think you're protecting us,

1300
01:10:16.191 --> 01:10:18.170
you think that was like Iraq that attacked us.

1301
01:10:18.171 --> 01:10:21.200
Like we can disagree and we can talk about facts and stuff like that,

1302
01:10:21.201 --> 01:10:25.070
but I get it.
But for someone to wake up every day and be like,
oh,

1303
01:10:25.071 --> 01:10:28.730
there are dudes fucking like wells are being sucked in there.

1304
01:10:28.770 --> 01:10:33.500
Make that their issue is crazy.
Their defense though,
with a lot of them,

1305
01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:34.490
they were,
look,

1306
01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:39.260
the real problem with religion is that anybody telling you absolutely they know

1307
01:10:39.261 --> 01:10:43.280
what God wants you to do is fucking crazy,
crazy.
Every one of them.

1308
01:10:43.460 --> 01:10:45.650
Anyone who tells you,
anyone who wrote anything down,

1309
01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:49.220
and that's not taking away from the idea that there's not some sort of a natural

1310
01:10:49.221 --> 01:10:50.330
order to the universe.

1311
01:10:50.331 --> 01:10:53.600
And maybe there's some sort of higher power consciousness that is at the end of

1312
01:10:53.601 --> 01:10:57.860
this whole crazy ride that we're all on.
But when you decide that,

1313
01:10:57.861 --> 01:11:00.650
you definitely know that this shouldn't be happening,

1314
01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:03.830
even though the people that are doing it or enjoying it because it's some

1315
01:11:03.890 --> 01:11:07.160
ancient thing that's just some guy that God wants his stuff.

1316
01:11:07.950 --> 01:11:09.930
We have an education problem.
That's what that is,
right?

1317
01:11:09.940 --> 01:11:14.130
That is an education problem.
That is a consciousness.
The problem that a problem

1318
01:11:14.130 --> 01:11:19.130
<v 1>with people that have not been raised to accept other people's happiness.</v>

1319
01:11:19.420 --> 01:11:22.420
<v 4>Well and I,
I dunno,
I don't think,
I,
I don't think I've ever talked about this.</v>

1320
01:11:22.421 --> 01:11:26.890
I don't think I talked about in your shower or anything,
but like I,
I have,

1321
01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:31.900
I started thinking that way since I was naked.
I was more of a Dick.

1322
01:11:31.901 --> 01:11:36.490
I was more selfish.
Uh,
when I believed in some kind of God,

1323
01:11:36.491 --> 01:11:38.050
I was never like religious.
Like I never went to church.

1324
01:11:38.051 --> 01:11:41.500
I never went to synagogue.
I never,
I always knew organized religion.

1325
01:11:41.530 --> 01:11:42.640
Here's how crazy religion is.

1326
01:11:43.030 --> 01:11:47.790
I even though I was on stage talking about how I thought,
uh,
I,

1327
01:11:47.791 --> 01:11:50.080
I consider myself agnostic.
Uh,

1328
01:11:50.110 --> 01:11:52.900
which to me is almost like worse than being a Christian.

1329
01:11:52.901 --> 01:11:54.550
Cause these Christians are taking a stand.

1330
01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:57.670
I'm standing at a stand where it's like agnostics to me are like independent

1331
01:11:57.671 --> 01:12:00.910
voters where it's like make up your fucking mind and start losing friends like

1332
01:12:00.911 --> 01:12:02.340
me,
like start alienating

1333
01:12:02.390 --> 01:12:04.100
<v 1>people and just be fucking miserable all the time.</v>

1334
01:12:04.140 --> 01:12:07.340
World needs agnostics think we need agnostics with almost everything.

1335
01:12:07.470 --> 01:12:10.590
<v 4>But here's what I actually,
I think that most atheists or agnostics,</v>

1336
01:12:10.620 --> 01:12:12.030
because like if we're going,

1337
01:12:12.031 --> 01:12:14.040
if we're going to be technical and then I'll get back to like,

1338
01:12:14.041 --> 01:12:15.090
if we're going to be technical,

1339
01:12:15.630 --> 01:12:18.360
anyone who says they're 100% sure that there is a god or there isn't,

1340
01:12:18.361 --> 01:12:21.720
God is wrong.
So as an agnostic,
I'm like,
all right,

1341
01:12:21.721 --> 01:12:25.890
so I look for evidence and I looked for science and until that happens,

1342
01:12:26.220 --> 01:12:30.690
um,
I'm just going to live like there's no god or whatever.
And,
but if right now,

1343
01:12:30.691 --> 01:12:32.370
like during the podcast,
like,
you know,

1344
01:12:32.371 --> 01:12:35.220
something happened and God came down and I wouldn't be like,
fuck you over.

1345
01:12:35.230 --> 01:12:38.370
Read Sam Harris.
You're not real.
I'd be like,
I was wrong.
You know?

1346
01:12:38.750 --> 01:12:42.350
<v 1>No one man,
Sam Harris is a friend of mine and Sam Harris is a brilliant guy,</v>

1347
01:12:42.351 --> 01:12:47.351
but Sam Harris doesn't know exactly how the universe works either.

1348
01:12:48.020 --> 01:12:51.590
No.
All I'm saying,
yeah,
but just say you're an atheist.
When,

1349
01:12:51.610 --> 01:12:55.520
when you see these guys who are these,
um,
these string furious,

1350
01:12:55.580 --> 01:12:56.630
this theorist dudes,

1351
01:12:56.660 --> 01:13:01.660
these guys who were working on trying to decipher the,

1352
01:13:01.851 --> 01:13:05.300
the very matter that,
that constitutes a university,

1353
01:13:05.301 --> 01:13:07.190
they're trying to figure out like at the,
at the very heart of it,

1354
01:13:07.191 --> 01:13:11.330
what are they're,
they're finding these mathematical computations.

1355
01:13:11.331 --> 01:13:15.350
They're finding these mathematical patterns in nature and like,

1356
01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:18.380
we know that in the FIBONACCI sequence that in the,
it just,

1357
01:13:18.381 --> 01:13:22.610
even the design of faces and sunflowers,
if there's an actual formula,

1358
01:13:22.860 --> 01:13:25.500
a numerical formula to all of this,
right,

1359
01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:27.410
and they're not exactly sure what that means,

1360
01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:33.400
it could mean that there's some sort of a spiritual or guiding energy or ethic

1361
01:13:36.020 --> 01:13:36.830
at the end of the unit.

1362
01:13:36.830 --> 01:13:37.581
<v 4>I have the answer.</v>

1363
01:13:37.581 --> 01:13:41.730
I have that the meaning of life you're about to get on the show.
First of all,
uh,

1364
01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:45.710
the first part of the meaning of life is Sam.
Dot.
Tortures,
tortures,

1365
01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:49.620
tortures told me that.
And so it,
racial profiling for Sam Harris.
Sam,
just,

1366
01:13:49.670 --> 01:13:51.860
if you're listening,
it's not good.
Is that you're a smart guy.

1367
01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:55.010
I love letter to Christian,
Asian,
racial profiling.
Not Good.
All right.

1368
01:13:55.370 --> 01:13:57.290
My meaning of life.
Um,

1369
01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:02.570
act like you don't know and just be fucking like,
look,

1370
01:14:02.690 --> 01:14:06.890
there is more harm in living.
Like there is a god,
then there isn't.

1371
01:14:07.070 --> 01:14:10.820
So it's cool to not be sure items in living life there is a,

1372
01:14:11.230 --> 01:14:15.780
there is more potential to be harm because I so disagree with people.

1373
01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:16.833
Here's what you can

1374
01:14:17.260 --> 01:14:17.990
<v 1>people,</v>

1375
01:14:17.990 --> 01:14:22.990
it actually works as a scaffolding and then Christianity and the idea of good

1376
01:14:23.350 --> 01:14:26.410
being a good person and being a good Christian and Christian values and,

1377
01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:29.360
and treating your brothers if he were yourself,
you know that,

1378
01:14:29.370 --> 01:14:30.430
I mean that is in the Bible.

1379
01:14:30.430 --> 01:14:33.790
<v 4>Well,
but something that Sam has sat,
but I bet,
I mean there's also,
you know,</v>

1380
01:14:34.940 --> 01:14:37.500
you're going to go to hell if you don't believe Jesus should be slightly for

1381
01:14:37.650 --> 01:14:39.610
different types of cloth.
You go to hell.

1382
01:14:40.270 --> 01:14:45.270
But I think that like I didn't need the Bible to tell me not to be an asshole.

1383
01:14:45.730 --> 01:14:47.940
Like good.
Okay,
good,
didn't

1384
01:14:47.980 --> 01:14:48.520
<v 1>you didn't.</v>

1385
01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:52.840
But maybe there's a dude who has a nine volt battery brain and he does,

1386
01:14:52.870 --> 01:14:55.690
he needs it.
He needs,
I will look,
you know,

1387
01:14:56.050 --> 01:15:01.050
we don't necessarily all go into this life with the same equipment and there's,

1388
01:15:01.540 --> 01:15:05.770
there's a lot of people that for whatever reason,

1389
01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:10.790
it makes them feel better.
It makes their life better.
The whole ball of wax,

1390
01:15:10.870 --> 01:15:12.010
whole ball of Christianity.

1391
01:15:12.390 --> 01:15:17.100
<v 4>What I was saying about the agnostic thing though is so for them,
cool.
Right?</v>

1392
01:15:17.130 --> 01:15:18.590
Like they're not hurting anyone if they,

1393
01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:20.580
if they don't hate the gays because of it or think,

1394
01:15:20.581 --> 01:15:24.690
Oh waw fucking sell as a baby or whatever.
Fine.
Um,

1395
01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:27.000
but I think when you're kind of teetering,

1396
01:15:27.810 --> 01:15:32.810
like I've seen friends of mine and family members who have act and I've done

1397
01:15:33.421 --> 01:15:37.770
this,
who when I thought there was a god I was less charitable.

1398
01:15:38.070 --> 01:15:39.300
Um,
really,

1399
01:15:39.390 --> 01:15:42.150
totally because there was this newer or less charity because there was a part of

1400
01:15:42.151 --> 01:15:45.810
me,
but I was also fucking poor.
We will also,
probably you were young too,

1401
01:15:46.050 --> 01:15:48.570
but there was also pump.
But I would tell myself,

1402
01:15:48.571 --> 01:15:52.050
I remember specifically like walking by people that maybe now I would give money

1403
01:15:52.051 --> 01:15:55.410
to.
Maybe I won.
Uh,
but I'd walk by someone and it'd be like,
well,

1404
01:15:55.411 --> 01:15:58.080
God will take care of it.
Right?
Or like oversee.
It's like,
well,

1405
01:15:58.081 --> 01:16:01.500
God won't let this happen even though there've been so many wars and plagues and

1406
01:16:01.501 --> 01:16:03.990
all this stuff.
And then once I was like,
you know what,

1407
01:16:03.991 --> 01:16:07.950
there's probably not a god,
let's just live like there's not one.
Um,

1408
01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:10.790
I actually took all those cliches about,
you know,

1409
01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:13.770
live everyday like it's your last and stuff like that.
Uh,

1410
01:16:13.771 --> 01:16:15.180
I started listening to them where I'm like,

1411
01:16:15.181 --> 01:16:17.460
I'm just going to try to be a good person because this is probably it.

1412
01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:22.330
And if it's not fucking bonus,
right?
Like if there's a heaven and there,

1413
01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:24.900
there's a god and I found out I was wrong,
I'm not going to be like,

1414
01:16:25.170 --> 01:16:27.990
fuck you mother fucker and like charge him,
swing it.
I'm going to be like,

1415
01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:32.980
awesome because,
and don't get me wrong.
Like I,
when I was,
uh,

1416
01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:34.800
when I was onstage making fun of religion,

1417
01:16:35.310 --> 01:16:39.330
literally onstage making fun of organized religion,
I still believe that a god,

1418
01:16:39.331 --> 01:16:41.400
like I remember,
I consider myself agnostic,

1419
01:16:41.401 --> 01:16:44.970
but my wife was the first atheist I've ever met.
And so I was like,

1420
01:16:44.971 --> 01:16:48.000
so you're agnostic.
And she goes,
I'm an atheist.

1421
01:16:48.060 --> 01:16:50.110
And even though I was onstage criticizing religion,

1422
01:16:50.111 --> 01:16:53.060
it's like a match made in heaven.
I doubt the,
the,

1423
01:16:53.130 --> 01:16:55.900
the child get together and murder some lettuce and

1424
01:16:57.930 --> 01:17:00.840
you don't do that.
You Hunt Christian agnostic and atheist.

1425
01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:02.820
But there was part of me in my head that I was just like,

1426
01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:05.040
when she told me that I got really scared and I was like,

1427
01:17:05.041 --> 01:17:08.140
but you're gonna go to hell.
And like,
I was on stage.

1428
01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:10.340
Like I didn't think I believed in it for real.

1429
01:17:10.580 --> 01:17:14.270
<v 6>But like religion was so powerful.
And even if you don't grow up that religious,</v>

1430
01:17:14.690 --> 01:17:17.600
we know when you grow up,
even people who consider themselves an atheist,

1431
01:17:17.601 --> 01:17:21.050
they still remember just like,
I mean,
threatening the child with hell.

1432
01:17:21.051 --> 01:17:25.220
Like that's some scary fucking shit.
Tell me,
man,
I grew up Catholic.

1433
01:17:25.310 --> 01:17:26.860
I went to Catholic school for you,
it's terrible.

1434
01:17:26.861 --> 01:17:29.380
You will never feel like you're not in the way when you're,

1435
01:17:29.540 --> 01:17:31.370
when you go to Catholic Church and Catholic school,

1436
01:17:31.371 --> 01:17:34.250
especially like in fucking Harrison,
New Jersey,

1437
01:17:34.460 --> 01:17:37.850
like this is some dark shit going on.
There's not a lot of happiness.

1438
01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:41.210
There's no fucking sunny days when you get out of that place.
Right.
Oh,
so what,

1439
01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:44.790
what I was going to say about um,
beliefs,
people,
right?

1440
01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:48.380
So I know people who aren't religious,
they're certainly not homophobic.
I mean,

1441
01:17:48.410 --> 01:17:50.450
I'm sorry they don't go to church,
but they believe in a god.

1442
01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:52.670
And a lot of times like,
you know,

1443
01:17:52.671 --> 01:17:55.070
they've used that sort of as an excuse for like,

1444
01:17:55.190 --> 01:17:58.580
let's say they have like a drug relapse or an alcohol relapse.
They're like,

1445
01:17:58.581 --> 01:18:00.860
well maybe God had another plan for me.

1446
01:18:01.190 --> 01:18:05.240
Or just because someone uses it in a week way doesn't discount them using it in

1447
01:18:05.241 --> 01:18:08.750
a positive way.
And that's why I'm saying like if you,
again,

1448
01:18:08.751 --> 01:18:09.650
if you're a good person,

1449
01:18:09.651 --> 01:18:12.440
cause you're religious or a good person and you're an atheist,
like great,

1450
01:18:12.441 --> 01:18:16.130
do your thing.
But when it came to like being an agnostic,
I would rather,

1451
01:18:16.250 --> 01:18:18.110
I would rather live like there is no god and I'm like,

1452
01:18:18.111 --> 01:18:19.970
I'm just gonna try to be a good person for the right reasons.

1453
01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:23.660
Not because I want to get fucking rewarded in heaven where we can see all my

1454
01:18:23.661 --> 01:18:27.440
dead cats and eat pancakes or whatever the fuck people think heaven is and not

1455
01:18:27.441 --> 01:18:29.090
because I'm scared to burn the hell.

1456
01:18:29.090 --> 01:18:32.360
Like I want people to be decent people to be decent fucking people.

1457
01:18:32.380 --> 01:18:36.020
Well it makes life nicer.
That's really where it's at.

1458
01:18:36.021 --> 01:18:37.970
And I think people don't understand that you can,

1459
01:18:38.420 --> 01:18:42.560
if you ever been in a party where you're hanging out with all your best friends

1460
01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:45.620
and you know you're sitting by the pools,
some music is playing,

1461
01:18:45.621 --> 01:18:48.940
maybe you have a couple of drinks and everybody's having a good fucking time and

1462
01:18:49.010 --> 01:18:51.950
everybody's being nice to each other and never,
you know what I mean?

1463
01:18:51.951 --> 01:18:53.900
It's like you love having a good party,
right?
Well,

1464
01:18:53.910 --> 01:18:56.600
life could be a fucking party stupid.
It really can be.

1465
01:18:56.601 --> 01:19:00.530
You just gotta be a nice person and surround yourself with other people that are

1466
01:19:00.531 --> 01:19:01.970
trying to be a nice person as well.

1467
01:19:01.971 --> 01:19:04.880
Take responsibility for your own fucking actions.
Get your shit together,

1468
01:19:05.060 --> 01:19:10.060
contribute your part so that everybody feels good about the interactions with

1469
01:19:10.191 --> 01:19:10.520
you.

1470
01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:14.140
Give people more than you think they deserve just so they feel better about it.

1471
01:19:14.141 --> 01:19:16.880
Yeah.
And if you can do that,
if you could figure out how to do that,

1472
01:19:17.060 --> 01:19:20.330
you can have a good life.
This is actually awesome to do that.
Just have that,

1473
01:19:20.331 --> 01:19:24.830
cause I wanted to,
to bring this up,
when you wrote that thing on Jujitsu,
uh,

1474
01:19:24.831 --> 01:19:28.280
that kind of went viral about ego and Jujitsu.
I actually didn't read it.

1475
01:19:28.300 --> 01:19:32.840
I said it or he said,
right when I got my black belt,
I did like a little speech.

1476
01:19:33.490 --> 01:19:35.930
The speech.
Okay.
So when that went,

1477
01:19:36.110 --> 01:19:38.900
when something printed it and like people started passing it around.
I'm like,

1478
01:19:38.930 --> 01:19:40.790
at least Marcello School in New York.
I'm like,

1479
01:19:40.791 --> 01:19:42.890
I think like Jujitsu squirrels worldwide.

1480
01:19:42.891 --> 01:19:46.790
We're like fucking rejoicing where everyone was so happy about it.
And

1481
01:19:48.350 --> 01:19:50.930
I really do believe,
oh,
unless you want me to what I said,

1482
01:19:50.990 --> 01:19:52.640
what I said is that it's,

1483
01:19:52.910 --> 01:19:57.650
I meet a lot of people through Jujitsu that are really fucking cool and one of

1484
01:19:57.651 --> 01:19:59.100
the reasons is that they,

1485
01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:03.710
their ego gets confronted with reality on a daily basis.
When you do Jujitsu,

1486
01:20:03.711 --> 01:20:06.620
you're,
you're basically battling to the death.
I mean,
that's what you're doing.

1487
01:20:06.621 --> 01:20:09.330
You're trying to bar each other.
It's very technical.
You're,

1488
01:20:09.331 --> 01:20:12.090
you're trying to use your technique in an intelligent manner.

1489
01:20:12.091 --> 01:20:16.560
He tried to pace your body and intelligent manner.
It's a very real scenario.

1490
01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:20.940
And when you,
you tap or when you get dominated or even when you,

1491
01:20:21.060 --> 01:20:24.390
you defeat someone,
you learn something from the process,

1492
01:20:24.391 --> 01:20:28.410
you grow and develop and it is real and concrete.

1493
01:20:28.580 --> 01:20:31.950
If a guy taps you,
it is real and concrete.
There's no getting around it.

1494
01:20:31.980 --> 01:20:34.500
He got you.
And that was it.
Well,
that's what I love about it.

1495
01:20:34.501 --> 01:20:36.600
Where like people don't have that in real life.

1496
01:20:36.910 --> 01:20:39.630
And even a lot of like other arts,
like if you're a shitty musician,

1497
01:20:39.990 --> 01:20:43.770
you can tell yourself that people don't get you and that you're trying to do

1498
01:20:43.771 --> 01:20:48.280
something.
But if you get choked out,
you're just shitty.
You have to tap,
right.

1499
01:20:48.330 --> 01:20:50.730
If you're a bad comedian,
again,
you can blame the audience or whatever.

1500
01:20:50.731 --> 01:20:53.640
But when it's you who's physically as put yourself in a position where you're

1501
01:20:53.641 --> 01:20:55.440
vulnerable to the submission,
someone's locked it on,

1502
01:20:55.441 --> 01:20:58.310
then you have to take your hand and say,
I give up.
You know,

1503
01:20:58.410 --> 01:21:01.770
there's no talking out of that.
And what's so interesting to me,

1504
01:21:01.771 --> 01:21:05.340
especially having like a really liberal base is sometimes,

1505
01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:08.490
and this is what I got like the most furious on Twitter or when people were
like,

1506
01:21:08.491 --> 01:21:10.670
oh,
you were Vegan but you support human cockfighting,

1507
01:21:10.680 --> 01:21:13.050
you support this fucking blood sport sport MMA.

1508
01:21:13.350 --> 01:21:16.260
And you know what's so upsetting?

1509
01:21:16.261 --> 01:21:20.310
It's like the Vegan argument's ridiculous cause I'm like,
yeah,
totally man.

1510
01:21:20.311 --> 01:21:23.250
All of a sudden things a vegan chickens don't get fucking fighter of the night

1511
01:21:23.350 --> 01:21:26.610
over war [inaudible] six days without they shit.
Right.

1512
01:21:26.630 --> 01:21:31.260
Should I just fucking can suck it?
Give the,
give them a shot against the farmers.

1513
01:21:31.261 --> 01:21:35.100
Just,
all right,
you can try to fight your way out.
Chicken.
Uh,
but fucking,

1514
01:21:35.580 --> 01:21:39.390
but what's so interesting to me is like the hardcore lefties who come at you for

1515
01:21:39.391 --> 01:21:44.250
your interest.
We're,
I guess we're not really a hardcore lesbian.
You're fine.

1516
01:21:44.251 --> 01:21:47.820
Really fucking negative people.
But here in every walk of life,

1517
01:21:47.910 --> 01:21:50.670
it's so interesting tying into what you wrote is like,

1518
01:21:50.671 --> 01:21:55.320
so this week I competed in Ibj f and he won a bronze medal.
Right.

1519
01:21:57.450 --> 01:22:01.190
It was my first competition.
That's awesome,
man.
I turned 30 and I was,

1520
01:22:01.210 --> 01:22:04.350
I'm gonna Start fucking competing.
What Bell to you?
I'm just biased.
Got My blue.

1521
01:22:04.380 --> 01:22:07.230
I only started doing g like last year.
That's beautiful.
Yeah.

1522
01:22:07.231 --> 01:22:10.110
You just got your boom,
boom.
I got it.
Like,
dude,
whatever you do,
man.

1523
01:22:10.111 --> 01:22:12.950
A police stick to that.
I know you were trying to do some,
some,

1524
01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:16.650
some Thai boxing and stuff.
Oh No.
I had like the one Thai boxing fight.

1525
01:22:16.651 --> 01:22:21.430
It went great.
And I'm like,
I don't want him to win.
Awesome.
That's beautiful.

1526
01:22:21.470 --> 01:22:24.840
But I was like,
popped up.
I was going to hurt,
you know,
I'm better at more time.

1527
01:22:24.850 --> 01:22:27.210
I don't even really like training anymore.
I just loved the reason.

1528
01:22:27.211 --> 01:22:27.721
I love Jiu Jitsu.

1529
01:22:27.721 --> 01:22:32.490
I just love Jujitsu culture and kind of so well you know what,

1530
01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:35.960
in retrospect or,
or rather a comparison,
um,

1531
01:22:36.090 --> 01:22:41.040
I grew up in a kickbox and culture I grew up with and Muay Thai and boxing and

1532
01:22:41.070 --> 01:22:44.630
taekwondo and it is a more douchey world.
Yeah.

1533
01:22:44.820 --> 01:22:48.510
The reality is because first of all,
you don't spar hard every day.

1534
01:22:48.511 --> 01:22:51.150
You don't go out and every day and in Jujitsu you got it every day.

1535
01:22:51.180 --> 01:22:52.050
Well that's kind of your day.

1536
01:22:52.051 --> 01:22:55.650
You're resisting getting tapped one and lots of times you don't spar at all and

1537
01:22:55.651 --> 01:22:58.650
you just do pad work and it's a glorified cardio kickboxing class.

1538
01:22:58.680 --> 01:23:02.910
And when you do spar,
you don't go full out.
Right?
No you're not.
You shouldn't,

1539
01:23:02.970 --> 01:23:06.550
you certainly shouldn't.
If we were supposed to spar and I tried to attack you,

1540
01:23:06.790 --> 01:23:09.220
I would be an asshole.
You'd be like,
dude,
slow the fuck down.
Right.

1541
01:23:09.310 --> 01:23:12.200
Cause you're not learning anything when you're going to war like that didn't do

1542
01:23:12.250 --> 01:23:13.570
it is just covering up.

1543
01:23:13.571 --> 01:23:16.600
And I rarely have to say that in Jujitsu and kickbox and I've had to be like,

1544
01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:19.030
tell me if we're in a real fight because if we're in a real fight,

1545
01:23:19.090 --> 01:23:21.580
I'm going to hit you as hard as you're hitting me and people hitting you in

1546
01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:25.620
Jujitsu.
Oh No,
no,
no.
And kickback where it's,
yeah,

1547
01:23:25.630 --> 01:23:30.070
the level of spasm because in Jujitsu I welcome spazzes because you need to know

1548
01:23:30.071 --> 01:23:34.750
that a guy can do that using the is using leverage and being smaller and like

1549
01:23:34.751 --> 01:23:36.670
getting around that.
Not even that.

1550
01:23:36.671 --> 01:23:40.660
I mean someone going fucking crazy using all their might right away,

1551
01:23:40.870 --> 01:23:43.000
which a god good God never does.
No good guy.

1552
01:23:43.001 --> 01:23:47.020
We'll lock up to you like maybe 30% and then you start moving with each other

1553
01:23:47.021 --> 01:23:48.400
and he's looking for advantages,

1554
01:23:48.401 --> 01:23:51.940
but he's not gonna do anything stupid doors and kick some ass more than Marcello

1555
01:23:51.940 --> 01:23:54.880
Garcia black belt.
Uh,
and he,
he,

1556
01:23:55.030 --> 01:23:58.330
and I'll just do this thing where you literally feel like you're like,
am I,

1557
01:23:58.360 --> 01:24:01.210
because there's,
it's just like gumby arms and you're like,

1558
01:24:01.211 --> 01:24:02.710
am I about to get a lock up?

1559
01:24:02.740 --> 01:24:04.630
He's on my back and like you don't even know how it happened.

1560
01:24:04.630 --> 01:24:07.100
And there was zero fucking strength used.
Uh,

1561
01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:09.310
well what I love so much about it is,

1562
01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.670
so I trained with Marcello in New York,

1563
01:24:12.730 --> 01:24:16.290
but because the competition was in Las Vegas,
um,
I went out to Robert Drysdale,

1564
01:24:16.291 --> 01:24:20.140
his place and Drysdale is like super political,
one of the smartest guys I know,

1565
01:24:20.141 --> 01:24:22.570
one of the best Jujitsu players in the world.

1566
01:24:22.870 --> 01:24:24.460
And there was part of me that was nervous,
like,
you know,

1567
01:24:24.490 --> 01:24:26.170
cause I didn't know how politics works.
I don't,

1568
01:24:26.290 --> 01:24:28.900
I've only started really traveling and training and at other schools.

1569
01:24:29.110 --> 01:24:33.280
So I had like my Marcello Garcia key cause was the only fucking Gi had,
you know,

1570
01:24:33.281 --> 01:24:34.810
Drysdale is fucking fought Marcello.

1571
01:24:35.260 --> 01:24:40.260
And not only did him and the people my age and the people who were at my belt,

1572
01:24:40.331 --> 01:24:43.420
and the people who may at the time didn't know we're going to be competing in my

1573
01:24:43.421 --> 01:24:48.010
division,
but they just instantly treated me like such a fucking family member.

1574
01:24:48.100 --> 01:24:51.250
I mean,
Robert Cornered me and I go,
dude,
I have like Marcello's Gee,

1575
01:24:51.251 --> 01:24:53.590
I'm like registered under.
And he goes,
I don't care.
He's like,

1576
01:24:53.591 --> 01:24:56.380
you're my fucking friend.
I'm going to corner Gail.
And he cornered me.

1577
01:24:56.410 --> 01:25:00.670
And what's so funny is if people walked by that school or if those lefties on

1578
01:25:00.671 --> 01:25:04.050
Twitter or not even left,
he's just people who don't get MMA,
um,

1579
01:25:04.060 --> 01:25:07.630
who call it a bloodsport.
Maybe if you walked by during a sparring session,

1580
01:25:07.631 --> 01:25:08.071
you'd be like,
wow,

1581
01:25:08.071 --> 01:25:10.600
it looks fucked up and scary because dudes are like jumping on each other's

1582
01:25:10.601 --> 01:25:13.660
backs and driving each other into the walls and shit.
But when you go in there,

1583
01:25:13.661 --> 01:25:13.990
I'm like,

1584
01:25:13.990 --> 01:25:17.620
there was more camaraderie there that I've experienced in comedy that I've

1585
01:25:17.621 --> 01:25:20.350
experienced and a lot of these like liberal get togethers.

1586
01:25:20.590 --> 01:25:23.020
And what's so ironic and so frustrating,

1587
01:25:23.021 --> 01:25:26.050
and maybe this goes back to maybe this is what people need to do to treat people

1588
01:25:26.051 --> 01:25:29.140
decently.
It's like there are people of all fucking nationalities,

1589
01:25:29.141 --> 01:25:32.350
religious beliefs,
political beliefs,
strengths,
weaknesses,

1590
01:25:32.351 --> 01:25:36.250
builds and you fucking roll with someone for the first time.

1591
01:25:36.580 --> 01:25:39.610
If you've just met someone,
you shake their hand and you have like a killer role,

1592
01:25:39.611 --> 01:25:41.710
like a back and forth and we can both of you almost submit,

1593
01:25:41.711 --> 01:25:43.300
you'd like just to scheme and the bell rings.

1594
01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:47.070
I'm hugging that dude like he's a fucking long lost relative.
Oh yeah man,

1595
01:25:47.080 --> 01:25:49.270
you don't think twice about it.
And,

1596
01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:54.480
and it pisses me off to no end that that is how beautiful and wonderful Jujitsu

1597
01:25:54.910 --> 01:25:58.350
is.
But some people see it and they're like,
it's fucking bloodsport.

1598
01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:01.450
I thought you were living with violence.
I see what they're thinking.

1599
01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:04.070
What they're thinking is in a perfect world we

1600
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:05.390
<v 1>shouldn't need violence.</v>

1601
01:26:05.450 --> 01:26:10.440
And they are scared of people who are enthusiastic about my loans.

1602
01:26:10.490 --> 01:26:11.950
They think it's dangerous.
Sure.

1603
01:26:12.050 --> 01:26:15.920
And they're scared of people who actively train in something where you're,

1604
01:26:15.921 --> 01:26:16.371
you know,

1605
01:26:16.371 --> 01:26:19.360
what you're actively trying to do is figure out a way to harm someone via
Keller.

1606
01:26:19.470 --> 01:26:20.360
You know,
they're,

1607
01:26:20.361 --> 01:26:24.770
they're thinking from an evolved mindset and I totally agree with it.
However,

1608
01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:28.890
I'm stuck with this monkey body.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm,
I'm,

1609
01:26:28.900 --> 01:26:33.740
I'm a belt like a fucking chimpanzee and I have testosterone,
my system.
Sorry,

1610
01:26:34.610 --> 01:26:37.160
Emma's off.
Yeah.
Well what it is is you're,
you're,

1611
01:26:37.161 --> 01:26:38.930
you have a fucking ancient body.

1612
01:26:38.931 --> 01:26:42.330
We have these bodies that are 10,000 plus years of,

1613
01:26:42.420 --> 01:26:44.030
of whatever we've been doing.

1614
01:26:44.031 --> 01:26:49.031
That's how our DNA is designed to operate and what reward system we operate

1615
01:26:49.191 --> 01:26:51.710
under.
We have like fucking needs.

1616
01:26:51.711 --> 01:26:55.880
And one of the needs is men have a desire to prove themselves constantly.

1617
01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:56.330
Whether your need,

1618
01:26:56.330 --> 01:27:00.230
when do you want to exist in our society or whether you want to,
you know,

1619
01:27:00.231 --> 01:27:02.810
whether you want to try to make it out on your own.

1620
01:27:02.930 --> 01:27:05.110
Whatever the fuck you're trying to do.
One of the,

1621
01:27:05.111 --> 01:27:07.660
your main desires to stay alive,
one of your,

1622
01:27:07.661 --> 01:27:12.661
your main focuses is that men have this desire to do at least something special

1623
01:27:14.200 --> 01:27:18.110
to stand out.
I went to yoga once for the first time,
it was like that hot yoga,

1624
01:27:18.111 --> 01:27:20.180
which is like a fucking nightmare.
It's fucking awesome.

1625
01:27:20.210 --> 01:27:24.120
And there was a dude in the class and instantly I'm like,
all right,

1626
01:27:24.260 --> 01:27:25.760
all right mother fucker,
like,
let's do this.

1627
01:27:25.761 --> 01:27:27.660
And I was like holding the pose incorrectly,

1628
01:27:27.710 --> 01:27:31.570
like longer than like I should have just hurting myself.
And then,

1629
01:27:31.670 --> 01:27:34.770
and then whenever like I'd stop and I'd fuck up my parents,

1630
01:27:34.771 --> 01:27:36.950
they get my head and be like,
what kicked that guy's ass?
Like,
yeah,

1631
01:27:36.951 --> 01:27:39.560
there is that fucking bail testosterone.
It is dumb,

1632
01:27:39.561 --> 01:27:43.100
but it's also necessary for competition and it's necessary to get better.

1633
01:27:43.101 --> 01:27:43.520
It's the,

1634
01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:46.730
the thing is you have to learn to get good at it and you have to learn to get

1635
01:27:46.731 --> 01:27:49.100
good at it with your ego.
And that's where Jujitsu comes along.

1636
01:27:49.101 --> 01:27:52.430
You develop a healthy respect for competition.

1637
01:27:53.430 --> 01:27:57.860
I read Mark Marin was talking once about,
uh,
not being able to,

1638
01:27:57.861 --> 01:27:59.150
when he was growing up,
uh,
if,

1639
01:27:59.630 --> 01:28:04.190
if you wanted his parents to instill anything in him that they did is be able to

1640
01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:08.720
enjoy competition.
Cause he said he grew up and if he was losing a game,

1641
01:28:08.721 --> 01:28:12.200
he wanted to flip the board over.
He's like,
that was his tech mark.

1642
01:28:12.201 --> 01:28:16.550
Marin didn't take losing well named Mark Marin.
That I,
I mean,

1643
01:28:16.580 --> 01:28:18.110
that explains so much,
right?

1644
01:28:18.111 --> 01:28:21.020
I mean it really does about that that dude's interactions with people.

1645
01:28:21.230 --> 01:28:25.880
It's like if someone had just taking him to a,
you know,
some,

1646
01:28:25.890 --> 01:28:29.720
a Jujitsu class early on in life and allowed him to experience what this is like

1647
01:28:29.721 --> 01:28:34.220
a losing as a normal part of life.
If you don't want to get better,

1648
01:28:34.460 --> 01:28:39.260
well then you know,
you're not gonna.
If you don't want to get better than you,

1649
01:28:39.290 --> 01:28:42.260
you're not going to take any chances.
And if you don't take any chances,

1650
01:28:42.261 --> 01:28:44.040
you're not going to get better.
You take chances,

1651
01:28:44.041 --> 01:28:47.780
you're going to fail and you have to fail in order to learn how to move forward.

1652
01:28:47.950 --> 01:28:51.890
Well,
I was a,
I was training with,
uh,
with Keith Loria,
Kenny's brother in Boston,

1653
01:28:52.220 --> 01:28:55.340
and we were talking about ego and you know,
the times where you're like,

1654
01:28:55.341 --> 01:28:57.140
don't want to tap and stuff like that.
And he was like,
dude,

1655
01:28:57.141 --> 01:29:00.640
if you're not tapping,
you're not learning.
And Yeah,
I've heard lots of juices.

1656
01:29:00.641 --> 01:29:02.040
Do you guys talk about that?
And

1657
01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:04.710
<v 6>I love that.
I love,
uh,
I love a culture where like,</v>

1658
01:29:04.711 --> 01:29:09.180
you're encouraged to like take these fucking risks.
Uh,
and,
and that you learn.

1659
01:29:09.181 --> 01:29:12.720
You know,
when I lost to the Kitty one silver and I really was,
I mean,

1660
01:29:12.721 --> 01:29:15.180
it was a really close match,
you know,

1661
01:29:15.181 --> 01:29:18.120
I lost and like I was bummed out for like a second and then I was like,

1662
01:29:18.140 --> 01:29:20.280
went over to Robert and Mike.
I was like,
what happened?
Like,

1663
01:29:20.281 --> 01:29:22.770
what could I have done?
And he told me and I wonder if fucking wrote it down.

1664
01:29:22.970 --> 01:29:25.440
And I was like,
all right,
next time.
That's what it's all about.

1665
01:29:25.470 --> 01:29:26.940
It's in competition is good.
Look,

1666
01:29:26.941 --> 01:29:30.200
there's a lot of guys that I know that can tap me and I like rolling with them.

1667
01:29:30.201 --> 01:29:33.870
And I loved getting tapped.
I like to know what they're doing that can get me,
Oh,

1668
01:29:33.871 --> 01:29:37.730
do you?
When someone hit me with like an awesome,
like crazy mood laughing,

1669
01:29:37.900 --> 01:29:40.470
she's like,
what?
Just had just felt some dude and my back.

1670
01:29:40.471 --> 01:29:43.410
And then we rolled over twice and suddenly like,
he has like my arm,

1671
01:29:43.411 --> 01:29:46.470
like attached to my leg.
And I was like,
what?
What is this Jamie?

1672
01:29:46.471 --> 01:29:51.320
When are you going to fight Daniel Tosh?
What?
I think a download.

1673
01:29:51.450 --> 01:29:55.980
I heard,
uh,
he's not the easiest guy to the pin down.
He doesn't,
uh,

1674
01:29:56.010 --> 01:29:58.710
I believe you're not allowed to make eye contact with him.
What did it happen?

1675
01:29:58.711 --> 01:30:01.050
How the whole thing before we get to that,

1676
01:30:01.080 --> 01:30:05.540
why were you trying to fight some dude who was a,
a congressman or senator?

1677
01:30:05.990 --> 01:30:09.910
Chuck,
hold on,
let's back that up.
Since it's on a tape.

1678
01:30:09.911 --> 01:30:12.080
I was not trying to fight a senator.
Uh,

1679
01:30:12.140 --> 01:30:16.170
I was this conservative pundit name named Jonah Goldberg.

1680
01:30:16.830 --> 01:30:17.580
And you want to go to Burger?

1681
01:30:17.580 --> 01:30:22.580
Sorta like the stereotypical fucking huge out of shape.

1682
01:30:25.050 --> 01:30:29.250
Bully Republican goes on every fucking news broadcast advocating that we just

1683
01:30:29.251 --> 01:30:32.760
kill more brown people and,
but has never served,

1684
01:30:33.010 --> 01:30:34.590
really says we need to kill more brown people,

1685
01:30:34.830 --> 01:30:38.340
but we need to invade Iraq and we need to write a bold mother fucker and invade

1686
01:30:38.341 --> 01:30:40.500
Afghanistan and invade all these,
uh,

1687
01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:45.180
Brown ish places and uh,
it's fucked up and no one ever,
I mean,

1688
01:30:45.181 --> 01:30:48.960
people call him on his shit,
but like no one really costs money shit.

1689
01:30:48.990 --> 01:30:53.220
Like for example,
he still has a career even though Iraq and Afghanistan failed.

1690
01:30:53.430 --> 01:30:54.700
Like my,
my,

1691
01:30:54.750 --> 01:30:59.370
my whole thing is if you advocate a war that has killed hundreds of thousands of

1692
01:30:59.371 --> 01:31:02.040
people,
it's killed thousands of Americans.
Uh,

1693
01:31:02.041 --> 01:31:05.280
at the very least you should have to like,
when it comes to like the news sit,

1694
01:31:05.281 --> 01:31:08.370
the next wore out,
you know what I mean?
Like a fucking baseball player fucked up.

1695
01:31:08.371 --> 01:31:09.780
Just like sit it out.

1696
01:31:09.781 --> 01:31:12.450
Or at least like if he's going to go on TV and talk about how we need to bomb

1697
01:31:12.470 --> 01:31:16.650
Iran,
like under his name,
it should be like Jonah Goldberg,
Dude,

1698
01:31:16.651 --> 01:31:19.460
who was wrong about Iraq.
You know what I mean?
Because you know,
he just,

1699
01:31:19.470 --> 01:31:21.360
you saying he was wrong about a rack,

1700
01:31:21.361 --> 01:31:24.960
but they do Hollywood math on it and they'll tell you that it was a success for

1701
01:31:24.961 --> 01:31:29.090
democratic societies all over the world because we removed and evil dictator and

1702
01:31:29.091 --> 01:31:29.200
they,

1703
01:31:29.200 --> 01:31:32.760
they have a system in place that look how many are more superior or dictators

1704
01:31:32.770 --> 01:31:35.010
are,
look,
how many people died looking at my knee.

1705
01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:38.950
I mean the place is a shit storm.
Uh,
well I'm not saying that,

1706
01:31:39.050 --> 01:31:43.050
but what I'm saying is that a guy like that is never wrong in his eyes.

1707
01:31:43.051 --> 01:31:45.600
If you listen to conservative talk radio,
which I do all the time,

1708
01:31:45.601 --> 01:31:48.890
just to go crazy.
I listened to Patriot on,
on serious,

1709
01:31:49.040 --> 01:31:52.170
so they call themselves a Patriot radio.
It's so bad.

1710
01:31:52.171 --> 01:31:57.171
And it's just one dumb idea after another dumb idea about,

1711
01:31:57.811 --> 01:32:00.040
you know,
Christianity,
God's

1712
01:32:00.250 --> 01:32:04.420
<v 4>law in this world and oh well,
and,
and,
and the thing is like,</v>

1713
01:32:04.620 --> 01:32:08.170
we also have to remember,
let's say even Iraq was a perfect society.

1714
01:32:08.260 --> 01:32:09.430
That's not why we went there.

1715
01:32:09.431 --> 01:32:14.410
We went there because under the rule of law we said we were attacked.
Uh,

1716
01:32:14.420 --> 01:32:16.570
are we set a rack was responsible for nine 11.
I mean,

1717
01:32:16.571 --> 01:32:18.850
we didn't even go over there so that it's the same with Iran.
You know,

1718
01:32:18.851 --> 01:32:20.850
the people who want more with the Ron aren't saying we want to make a,

1719
01:32:20.940 --> 01:32:22.300
a democratic society.

1720
01:32:22.480 --> 01:32:25.570
They're saying these are the same people who hailed the Iranian revolution.

1721
01:32:25.720 --> 01:32:29.080
They're saying that,
uh,
we are a threat or they are a threat to Israel,

1722
01:32:29.081 --> 01:32:32.110
so we need to kill these guys.
And so he gets it.

1723
01:32:32.111 --> 01:32:36.490
This guy is talking all this shit bill called liberal fascist and he just gets

1724
01:32:36.491 --> 01:32:41.230
to keep going on the news,
keep writing books with incorrect information.

1725
01:32:41.230 --> 01:32:44.080
So one day he's,
he's shitting on young people.

1726
01:32:44.081 --> 01:32:47.710
He's saying that young people are stupid.
You should raise the voting age.

1727
01:32:47.711 --> 01:32:52.060
And you know,
he's right are odd.
Some young people are stupid you and a lot,

1728
01:32:52.470 --> 01:32:55.840
and we should take as young people,
we should make them read.
Of course,

1729
01:32:55.841 --> 01:33:00.070
you shouldn't have to,
maybe with electric chair tied to with a Taser video game,

1730
01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:02.470
every time they pick up a video game with you,
once they've read 10 bucks,

1731
01:33:02.471 --> 01:33:06.250
they're allowed to kettle bell and man get a battle rope if you read three.

1732
01:33:06.280 --> 01:33:10.860
Right,
right,
right.
And so he said that,
uh,
he said something,

1733
01:33:10.910 --> 01:33:15.790
he said he was joking.
He probably was,
maybe he wasn't a where he goes,
kids need,

1734
01:33:15.880 --> 01:33:19.900
uh,
uh,
these kids,
you'd have to socialism beaten out of him.

1735
01:33:19.960 --> 01:33:23.020
And he used the word beaten out of them.
Now you would say again,

1736
01:33:23.021 --> 01:33:25.990
me and you listening to that,
we wouldn't be like time to go beat some kids,

1737
01:33:26.230 --> 01:33:29.460
but there was a congressman who,
uh,

1738
01:33:29.730 --> 01:33:34.450
who last week said that,
you know,
Muslims are still threatening us every day.

1739
01:33:34.450 --> 01:33:37.210
And in his district,
two mosques were attacked.
Right.

1740
01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:41.140
So it's like to crazy people,
this shit resonates.
But even if it didn't resonate,

1741
01:33:41.141 --> 01:33:42.340
it was just another example.

1742
01:33:42.390 --> 01:33:46.070
One is a big difference from kids and a religious factions been known to have

1743
01:33:46.071 --> 01:33:50.410
suicide bomber still no,
sure.
I mean would be smacked,

1744
01:33:51.910 --> 01:33:56.840
right,
of course.
But it was another example because cause he,

1745
01:33:57.300 --> 01:33:59.830
cause he's someone else who has it,
who actually has said,
you know,

1746
01:33:59.831 --> 01:34:02.350
the Muslim stuff.
So there's another example of just him.

1747
01:34:02.351 --> 01:34:06.340
And so all I did was I tweeted him and I said,
hey man,
uh,

1748
01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:10.360
so I just about socialism,
I'm socialist e and clothes.

1749
01:34:10.390 --> 01:34:13.960
I'm not really a socialist.
Uh,
but you know,
close enough,

1750
01:34:14.260 --> 01:34:18.910
I'm 145 pound Vegan.
Uh,
there's sort of several tweets,
you know,

1751
01:34:18.911 --> 01:34:21.540
the joke about how do you tell if someone's Vegan?
Well,
I'll,

1752
01:34:21.550 --> 01:34:26.200
what is it you or they'll tell you wait.
They'll tell you.
Yeah.
Uh,
but I was like,

1753
01:34:26.740 --> 01:34:31.030
I was like,
he'll hate it.
He's one of the guys who compared,
uh,
who was like,

1754
01:34:31.150 --> 01:34:35.470
Hitler was a vegetarian and called Vegetarians,
which by the way,
me,
first of all,

1755
01:34:35.471 --> 01:34:38.740
you didn't expect this guy was really going fight you.
Well,
here,

1756
01:34:38.770 --> 01:34:42.040
here's what I wanted.
Again,
I was talking to my wife,
to Alison and I was like,

1757
01:34:42.041 --> 01:34:46.240
maybe he will write.
And she's like,
here's,
he was either situation.
Oh,

1758
01:34:46.241 --> 01:34:49.260
so to finish I wrote a whole piece for one cat about it and happy to post

1759
01:34:49.290 --> 01:34:51.940
interviewed me.
And essentially what I said was it can be regulated.

1760
01:34:51.941 --> 01:34:54.400
We'll do it for charity.
You have about a hundred pounds on me,

1761
01:34:54.401 --> 01:34:56.830
I know how to fight,
but you can wear head gear,
I won't wear any head gear,

1762
01:34:56.831 --> 01:34:58.070
it'll time rounds,
referee,

1763
01:34:58.490 --> 01:35:00.020
<v 5>I'll give it to Palestinians.</v>

1764
01:35:00.021 --> 01:35:02.960
You can buy like an iron ran fuck doll or whatever you guys do with your money

1765
01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:06.980
and it'll be great.
And I never ever was threatening or anything like that.

1766
01:35:07.010 --> 01:35:11.180
And of course it was tongue in cheek in the sense that one of two things could

1767
01:35:11.181 --> 01:35:15.740
happen.
He could be fucking crazy enough to do it,
which I doubted because again,

1768
01:35:15.770 --> 01:35:18.350
you look at all these war hawks and these are people who have never served and

1769
01:35:18.351 --> 01:35:23.351
worse who are sending their kids to go back or he's going to have to respond and

1770
01:35:23.961 --> 01:35:26.630
just be exposed for being a fucking chicken shit.
Which is what he is.

1771
01:35:26.631 --> 01:35:29.060
He's a fucking chicken shit.
I like you Jamie,

1772
01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:32.360
and that's why I'm going to tell you this.
I think it was a really dumb idea

1773
01:35:34.370 --> 01:35:35.091
because first of all,

1774
01:35:35.091 --> 01:35:40.091
you opened up the gate and you said you would like to enact violence on him and

1775
01:35:41.390 --> 01:35:44.720
kickbox with him.
You know he's not a skillful at it.
Agreed upon.

1776
01:35:44.750 --> 01:35:47.680
Let me read upon by saying it's not fair.
I'm helping him in an hour.

1777
01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:50.040
Even if he's,
even though he's a hundred pounds heavy in you,

1778
01:35:50.060 --> 01:35:51.860
if you're a skilled fighter and you are,

1779
01:35:51.861 --> 01:35:53.990
and you've been training for a long time,
that's not fair.

1780
01:35:54.260 --> 01:35:57.350
Not only is it not fair,
it's kind of creepy.
It's Kinda creepy.
Hold on a second,

1781
01:35:57.351 --> 01:35:59.970
man.
For Real,
as a,
as a martial artist,
but you're,

1782
01:35:59.971 --> 01:36:01.850
you're not picking on another martial artists.

1783
01:36:01.851 --> 01:36:05.420
You're picking on someone who you know is completely athletically inept.

1784
01:36:05.450 --> 01:36:07.880
Someone who I know is not going to take the fight.

1785
01:36:07.910 --> 01:36:09.890
It doesn't then don't do it because then you're,

1786
01:36:09.940 --> 01:36:13.000
you're opening up the gates to someone wanting to do that to you now.

1787
01:36:13.120 --> 01:36:17.660
And then the next thing is,
look,
you're lefty Vegan socially Steve Bullshit is,

1788
01:36:17.661 --> 01:36:21.080
I've had enough of it.
You know,
I'm 185 pound meaty there.

1789
01:36:21.081 --> 01:36:25.080
How about I come smash your fucking face in,
right?
And then you know,
why?
Why is,

1790
01:36:26.030 --> 01:36:27.800
why is that happening?
Why is that happening?

1791
01:36:27.801 --> 01:36:32.030
Because you open up the door to challenging someone to a physical confrontation

1792
01:36:32.031 --> 01:36:35.570
with violence.
And that's what kickboxing is.
Whether it's agreed upon or not,

1793
01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:38.900
that is what it is.
I mean,
we be honest with you,
we're not even,

1794
01:36:39.080 --> 01:36:41.540
you're not even talking about Jujitsu.
You're talking about kickboxing.

1795
01:36:41.660 --> 01:36:43.760
And let me tell you something,
man.
You know,
you,

1796
01:36:43.761 --> 01:36:45.890
if you're in a fight and you're gonna hurt somebody,

1797
01:36:45.891 --> 01:36:48.350
you're going to try to kick them and you to try to punch them with all your
mind.

1798
01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:51.740
You're talking about assaulting a guy because you disagree with them.

1799
01:36:51.770 --> 01:36:56.000
I have had so many people in real life challenge me to fights after shows,

1800
01:36:56.001 --> 01:37:00.590
people that I could take if I was an asshole and,
and,
and,
and have new.

1801
01:37:00.620 --> 01:37:03.820
Sure.
You sure that you can take them.
I know by looking at it were some,

1802
01:37:03.920 --> 01:37:06.650
there were some are aging people and there was a range of people that could

1803
01:37:06.651 --> 01:37:09.700
wrestle some tiny fucking shoot a double on you and smash your face.

1804
01:37:10.330 --> 01:37:12.500
You'd be shocked.
Wrestlers are the bane of my existence.

1805
01:37:12.890 --> 01:37:15.290
Be Shocked at how many people out there who could kick your ass.

1806
01:37:15.291 --> 01:37:18.140
So how do you know?
You look at you shit too.
I'm like these like fucking five,

1807
01:37:18.141 --> 01:37:20.740
two Brazilians who are like these like crazy black pouts.
I yeah,

1808
01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:24.890
but that's one of the reasons that I would never,
I would never fight.

1809
01:37:25.340 --> 01:37:29.390
I would never fight.
You could take them,
but you're being nice.

1810
01:37:29.391 --> 01:37:30.360
And I'm saying you don't know.

1811
01:37:30.410 --> 01:37:33.300
Of course I'm silly or I'll get the shit kicked out of them.

1812
01:37:33.340 --> 01:37:35.360
So one of these things are happening.
Neither of them are great.
Um,

1813
01:37:35.420 --> 01:37:37.580
if I get the shit kicked out of me,
even worse,

1814
01:37:37.690 --> 01:37:40.430
you get in the fucking grueling drawn out brawl.

1815
01:37:40.431 --> 01:37:42.920
We're no one can get in and he doesn't want to quit and you just,

1816
01:37:42.950 --> 01:37:43.850
you got to keep going,

1817
01:37:43.910 --> 01:37:47.090
but does this make it on youtube and give me more Twitter followers,

1818
01:37:48.100 --> 01:37:50.350
whatever else.
Yes,
of course.
I wanted a,

1819
01:37:50.351 --> 01:37:52.910
I wanted to point this out first before I went to the Taj thing.

1820
01:37:53.270 --> 01:37:55.980
I definitely want to hear,
so here's what I want now,
but I wanted to,
obviously

1821
01:37:55.980 --> 01:37:57.330
<v 6>this dude is not going to take this fight.</v>

1822
01:37:57.420 --> 01:37:59.310
Obviously we're not going to fight obviously,

1823
01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:02.100
and in the hole in the article I wrote,
I was like,

1824
01:38:02.101 --> 01:38:04.380
I'm not encouraging a society of violence.

1825
01:38:04.381 --> 01:38:05.910
I don't think this is how you handle problems,

1826
01:38:05.911 --> 01:38:09.060
but I just wanted him to have to respond where it's like,

1827
01:38:09.090 --> 01:38:12.150
if you are going to be the one who starts the violent rhetoric,

1828
01:38:12.151 --> 01:38:14.550
because at no point did I say I challenge you to a fight.
I said,

1829
01:38:14.551 --> 01:38:17.880
if you want to beat a socialist,
GI will volunteer.
I understand,

1830
01:38:17.881 --> 01:38:19.770
but do you not understand that that is a,

1831
01:38:19.771 --> 01:38:23.190
it's a goal layering like ego situation.

1832
01:38:23.620 --> 01:38:27.330
You are putting yourself in this champion role.

1833
01:38:27.420 --> 01:38:29.360
Like you are going to step in and you are,

1834
01:38:29.390 --> 01:38:34.290
you're putting so much attention on yourself with a statement like that and
it's,

1835
01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:37.930
it completely changes just your opinion of what,

1836
01:38:37.931 --> 01:38:40.320
what you feel is wrong with his stances.

1837
01:38:40.440 --> 01:38:45.270
And it becomes a personal thing between a man and another man who lives in a

1838
01:38:45.271 --> 01:38:46.320
different way.
And it,
it's,

1839
01:38:46.520 --> 01:38:50.910
it takes the attention away from the issue and it puts the attention on you as

1840
01:38:50.911 --> 01:38:53.890
some sort of fucking Kim carnation figure.
And that's,
it's the,

1841
01:38:53.910 --> 01:38:58.170
it's not the right way to approach the problem was no one,

1842
01:38:58.920 --> 01:39:03.420
it was the first time that these fucking remarks and things got attention

1843
01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:07.380
because anyone can get attention.
It got attention amongst us.

1844
01:39:07.590 --> 01:39:09.150
It didn't get attention in the real world.

1845
01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:11.040
It was a publicity but it wasn't going to get.

1846
01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:15.210
But so you're saying by him using that violent rhetoric and being able to use
it,

1847
01:39:15.420 --> 01:39:19.620
uh,
ad Nauseum,
it never been called in it like that's also a publicity stunt.

1848
01:39:19.621 --> 01:39:22.530
And all I wanted to do was draw attention where it's like,
look,

1849
01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:27.060
I did not start the violent rhetoric.
Violence was never going to happen.

1850
01:39:27.180 --> 01:39:29.400
It was just strictly a point that it's like,
all right man,

1851
01:39:29.550 --> 01:39:32.460
well if you're going to go on and threatened kids,
right?

1852
01:39:33.340 --> 01:39:36.710
Really threatening kids is a complete figure of speech.
They need the they,

1853
01:39:36.810 --> 01:39:38.760
how many people have said that these idiots today,

1854
01:39:38.761 --> 01:39:42.510
they need the fucking sense slapped into,
well he said,
don't advocate slapping,

1855
01:39:42.511 --> 01:39:45.480
settle to make us smarter.
Is that physically?
And then he paused and he goes,

1856
01:39:45.481 --> 01:39:47.950
or literally and again better,

1857
01:39:47.951 --> 01:39:50.960
but in many who just completely absolved it.

1858
01:39:51.220 --> 01:39:54.060
The way we see that and we're like,
of course,
like I said before,

1859
01:39:54.061 --> 01:39:55.440
you're not going to fucking do it.

1860
01:39:55.620 --> 01:39:58.110
But I mean you look at some of these fucking crazy people,

1861
01:39:58.111 --> 01:40:00.810
you look at like the moss story,
you look at,
um,

1862
01:40:00.840 --> 01:40:03.360
you know a lot of these fucking like right wing militia types.

1863
01:40:03.361 --> 01:40:06.990
Like they're looking for people to fucking give them permission to do it.

1864
01:40:06.990 --> 01:40:10.500
You look at the abortion clinics and of course I did not think I was going to be

1865
01:40:10.501 --> 01:40:12.150
the fucking hero.
There's going to be a fight.

1866
01:40:12.151 --> 01:40:14.280
I was going to make this guy change all of his views.

1867
01:40:14.490 --> 01:40:17.190
All I wanted was finally someone just to be like,

1868
01:40:17.340 --> 01:40:18.780
if you're going to use this violent rhetoric,

1869
01:40:18.781 --> 01:40:20.850
just like if you're gonna use this violent rhetoric in the Middle East,

1870
01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:23.640
go fucking over there.
But we'll say it to one of their faces.

1871
01:40:23.730 --> 01:40:26.160
Go say it to someone who can actually defend themselves,

1872
01:40:26.161 --> 01:40:28.920
but I don't think that's violent rhetoric.
I disagree.

1873
01:40:28.921 --> 01:40:30.350
I think it's a figure of speech.

1874
01:40:30.351 --> 01:40:33.060
His career was the violent rhetoric and that was just the one where I'm like,

1875
01:40:33.090 --> 01:40:33.923
okay,

1876
01:40:34.040 --> 01:40:37.380
I can say I volunteered to be the socialists in the tongue and cheek fashion.

1877
01:40:37.420 --> 01:40:40.920
I really think you should never do that again and I really think that wasn't

1878
01:40:40.921 --> 01:40:43.880
going to be like my bit from now on or am I going to be the guy who challenges

1879
01:40:43.890 --> 01:40:47.720
people would only reason why people do it.
It's for their own ego.
I mean you're,

1880
01:40:47.721 --> 01:40:50.310
you're involving your own ability to do something,

1881
01:40:50.311 --> 01:40:54.820
your own physical athleticism in with some debate.
It totally doesn't belong.

1882
01:40:54.970 --> 01:40:57.300
When you do something like that,
it becomes a,
uh,

1883
01:40:57.340 --> 01:41:01.300
an almost indefensible publicity style is one of those things though when it's

1884
01:41:01.301 --> 01:41:04.510
like you're introducing yourself into an argument and be sure you're,

1885
01:41:04.511 --> 01:41:06.550
you're even involved in the debate,
but at the same time,

1886
01:41:06.551 --> 01:41:10.540
like people have to do that.
Like people have to,

1887
01:41:10.570 --> 01:41:14.490
not to that extent I'm saying,
but people have to,
if,

1888
01:41:14.770 --> 01:41:18.490
if there are people in the world who keep us housing and violent rhetoric,

1889
01:41:18.491 --> 01:41:20.860
that does have consequences,
that does lead us into wars,

1890
01:41:20.861 --> 01:41:22.180
that does get people hurt.

1891
01:41:22.450 --> 01:41:25.000
I'm not saying go challenge people to fights or anything like that,

1892
01:41:25.210 --> 01:41:29.650
but sometimes you do have to do something to draw more publicity than like if I

1893
01:41:29.651 --> 01:41:32.530
just tweeted him and I was like,
hey man,
that's fucked up rhetoric.
Or Hey,

1894
01:41:32.531 --> 01:41:34.120
I don't think we should have gone to Iraq.

1895
01:41:34.950 --> 01:41:38.530
It went to got an as much of the attention as it did.
Um,

1896
01:41:38.560 --> 01:41:41.070
and so like sometimes you come through,
you're,

1897
01:41:41.080 --> 01:41:44.890
you're saying you came close to missing,
you know,
it didn't accomplish anything.

1898
01:41:44.920 --> 01:41:47.380
You're,
you know,
you're saying,
well,
you came closer to miss some of this,

1899
01:41:47.500 --> 01:41:50.680
but it was a shot and he had to respond.
And he finally like,
you know,

1900
01:41:50.681 --> 01:41:55.360
you've seen a point.
Yes,
100%.
Does it make you embarrassed?

1901
01:41:55.450 --> 01:41:58.090
A little bit,
but at the same time it's like,

1902
01:41:58.330 --> 01:42:03.330
I guess I just want an answer of what to do because I don't like that people can

1903
01:42:04.901 --> 01:42:08.200
go on publicly and make livings out,
uh,

1904
01:42:08.230 --> 01:42:12.820
with rhetoric that gets people kill.
I agree.
Get people hurt.
Go.
It's like,

1905
01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:16.220
sure.
Mine was a silly publicity start from a comedian,
right?

1906
01:42:17.570 --> 01:42:19.330
Did I think Jonah Goldberg and be like,
Oh,
you know,

1907
01:42:19.331 --> 01:42:21.790
I'm gonna open up a shelter for Arabs because you know,

1908
01:42:22.010 --> 01:42:26.110
that Vegan showed me the way,
but you didn't even act as a,

1909
01:42:26.111 --> 01:42:29.200
is someone who was protesting his point of view.

1910
01:42:29.200 --> 01:42:31.120
You almost act like a heckler.

1911
01:42:31.960 --> 01:42:34.990
Someone to introduce yourself into the equation,

1912
01:42:34.991 --> 01:42:39.190
your own physical prowess into the equation of,
listen,
if you think you're a bad,

1913
01:42:39.191 --> 01:42:40.970
I'm going to represent socialists and I'm going to

1914
01:42:42.500 --> 01:42:46.920
my rhetoric because my rhetoric was the same height or bottling.
Yes.

1915
01:42:47.140 --> 01:42:50.110
What if he said yes?
He goes,
come on man,
you little Vegan Pussy,

1916
01:42:50.111 --> 01:42:52.750
let's fucking fight and then you're going to find them.
Represent them.

1917
01:42:52.751 --> 01:42:55.040
Really have here is that intuit.
We rarely do it.

1918
01:42:55.150 --> 01:42:59.320
I had had gear on a chair for charity if he was that into it.

1919
01:43:01.320 --> 01:43:03.120
Do you see how that's kind of gross?
Of course,

1920
01:43:03.240 --> 01:43:07.240
but that would never have it's but as the exact same as someone writes a blog

1921
01:43:07.241 --> 01:43:09.130
post,
someone writes a response,
blonde phone is right.

1922
01:43:09.370 --> 01:43:11.440
I just used that hyperbolic language of fighting,

1923
01:43:11.441 --> 01:43:13.420
which he was the one who introduced into the conversation,

1924
01:43:13.510 --> 01:43:15.070
so it's not really though.

1925
01:43:15.070 --> 01:43:18.310
He was talking about children having the sense smacked into them,

1926
01:43:18.311 --> 01:43:22.030
which has been said throughout history but not Gan.
Again,

1927
01:43:22.031 --> 01:43:26.220
to figure was the history of violence,
violent rhetoric.
I understand.

1928
01:43:26.410 --> 01:43:28.090
And so that was just something where I was like,

1929
01:43:28.091 --> 01:43:30.880
it's hard like people to grasp that you know,
that right.

1930
01:43:30.881 --> 01:43:33.040
When you respond to one thing in particular,

1931
01:43:33.041 --> 01:43:36.010
it better be warranted because people aren't going to take into account the

1932
01:43:36.011 --> 01:43:39.730
history of someone's,
you know,
Wa,
you know,
obsession for violence.
But I mean,

1933
01:43:39.760 --> 01:43:43.090
it ended like,
I thought it would end where it was like it didn't begin.

1934
01:43:43.120 --> 01:43:47.530
He had to respond.
It was funny.
Uh,
no one got hurt.

1935
01:43:47.560 --> 01:43:52.250
No one took it seriously.
Uh,
and it was just kind of like,
let's

1936
01:43:52.250 --> 01:43:57.250
<v 4>just remind people that this guy who has such authority and would go on the news</v>

1937
01:43:57.411 --> 01:44:01.220
with such authority,
without people even asking followup questions,

1938
01:44:01.370 --> 01:44:03.710
even being like you said the same thing about Iraq.

1939
01:44:04.190 --> 01:44:06.560
Do you think Iraq was a success?
Blah,
blah,
blah.
I mean,

1940
01:44:06.561 --> 01:44:08.060
she was a guy who said they would be celebrating

1941
01:44:08.310 --> 01:44:12.660
<v 3>to eat.
You threatened to fight and culture.
That'd be a more fair size contests.</v>

1942
01:44:12.780 --> 01:44:16.230
I think Daniel Tosh,
you get refereed.
You ever again here?

1943
01:44:16.260 --> 01:44:18.390
He doesn't even like Daniel.
Well,
no,

1944
01:44:18.391 --> 01:44:20.640
it sounded just like Daniel talks to that we have to talk about,

1945
01:44:20.641 --> 01:44:25.641
you tweeted a bunch of Shit that infuriated comedians when Daniel Tosh said,

1946
01:44:26.530 --> 01:44:30.870
uh,
to a woman,
uh,
she was uh,
she yelled out,
if you don't know the whole story,

1947
01:44:30.871 --> 01:44:31.920
this is the exact story.

1948
01:44:32.070 --> 01:44:35.520
Tosh is on stage and he was talking to the audience about,
you know,

1949
01:44:35.521 --> 01:44:37.290
what should he talk about next?

1950
01:44:37.291 --> 01:44:41.940
And someone yells out rape and he goes on,
he starts saying,

1951
01:44:41.970 --> 01:44:46.140
oh yeah,
like that's funny.
And like,
uh,
what's,
what's funny,

1952
01:44:46.141 --> 01:44:48.990
the humiliation,
what is it to violence?
He's,

1953
01:44:48.991 --> 01:44:52.500
he goes on this rant of all the things that are unfunny about rape,

1954
01:44:52.830 --> 01:44:55.230
at which point some woman yells out,

1955
01:44:55.410 --> 01:44:58.740
actually nothing is funny about rape,
right?

1956
01:44:59.040 --> 01:45:03.360
Like to stop this conversation now,
just all self righteously.
And he goes,

1957
01:45:03.510 --> 01:45:05.400
wouldn't be funny if like five guys raped right now,

1958
01:45:05.550 --> 01:45:10.550
which is the comedian thing to say in that scenario and is in no way endorsing

1959
01:45:10.921 --> 01:45:12.300
rape or rape of this woman.

1960
01:45:12.420 --> 01:45:15.990
But he had just gotten done in her thick fucking stupid head.

1961
01:45:16.110 --> 01:45:20.160
He'd just gotten done saying all the things that are wrong with rape and she is

1962
01:45:20.161 --> 01:45:23.040
so on.
Ironically arguing with him,

1963
01:45:23.041 --> 01:45:26.370
still saying actually nothing.
It's funny about rape.

1964
01:45:26.520 --> 01:45:31.380
She's a fucking idiot.
And then she goes online and writes a blog about it,

1965
01:45:31.470 --> 01:45:32.550
a huge dumb,

1966
01:45:32.551 --> 01:45:37.551
stupid diarrhea of the brain blog about what had happened when she heckled

1967
01:45:37.951 --> 01:45:38.784
Daniel Tosh.

1968
01:45:38.790 --> 01:45:42.750
And he happened to say the one thing that a comedian would say in that scenario

1969
01:45:42.960 --> 01:45:47.610
when he's saying all these terrible things that are what things are horrible

1970
01:45:47.611 --> 01:45:48.930
about rape and saying,

1971
01:45:48.931 --> 01:45:51.720
of course he can't joke about rape because it's nothing funny.

1972
01:45:51.870 --> 01:45:56.790
And then she self righteously Energex actually rape is never funny.
And he goes,

1973
01:45:56.791 --> 01:46:00.780
wouldn't it be funny if five guys raped her?
Okay.
That that is what started off.

1974
01:46:00.781 --> 01:46:02.170
And you defended that a woman,

1975
01:46:02.200 --> 01:46:05.950
<v 4>right?
So man,
he didn't like,
if you didn't like the Jonah Goldberg thing,</v>

1976
01:46:05.951 --> 01:46:07.980
prepare to be furious.
Uh,

1977
01:46:08.110 --> 01:46:10.750
it's always like such a wild adventure on Twitter after I do your show,

1978
01:46:10.751 --> 01:46:15.280
cause I got half people who I'm either friends or they will be fans for life as

1979
01:46:15.281 --> 01:46:18.760
I bro,
I'm like a Jujitsu guy and like I'm really progressive and blah,
blah,
blah.

1980
01:46:18.761 --> 01:46:22.060
And then there's like,
Hey,
uh,
Vegan,
Queer Homo.

1981
01:46:22.061 --> 01:46:25.060
I worked for Blackwater and I'm going to shoot you because I love her rape
jokes.

1982
01:46:25.061 --> 01:46:29.290
And it's like,
oh no.
So I'm about to get their lodge here.

1983
01:46:29.530 --> 01:46:33.790
Here's what I think.
If you talk to me
five years ago,

1984
01:46:33.820 --> 01:46:38.530
maybe even less,
I wouldn't have even thought about defending the Heckler,

1985
01:46:38.531 --> 01:46:41.560
especially because I have been heckled my entire career.
I'm like,

1986
01:46:41.561 --> 01:46:46.561
I think the youtube clip of me with the most hits is me berating meanly,

1987
01:46:47.620 --> 01:46:51.120
uh,
a guy,
a girl Hackler on my new CD.

1988
01:46:51.180 --> 01:46:55.290
I had four due to heckled May.
And like it,
it's a track I just like attacked,

1989
01:46:55.291 --> 01:46:59.880
attacked,
attacked.
Um,
and you know,

1990
01:46:59.910 --> 01:47:03.540
when all I thought about and when all I obsessed with and when all I listened to

1991
01:47:03.541 --> 01:47:07.050
was comedy,
that was always the most important thing to me.
Right.

1992
01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:10.800
It was the freedom of speech,
which I still believe in.
Um,

1993
01:47:10.830 --> 01:47:13.260
it was no one's sensors,
a comedian.
You can make anything funny,

1994
01:47:13.261 --> 01:47:17.370
which I also still believe,
and uh,
that was it.

1995
01:47:17.400 --> 01:47:20.250
No matter how offensive,
whether it was the Dane Cook Aurora joke,

1996
01:47:20.251 --> 01:47:24.840
whether it was Tracy Morgan,
the murdering the gay kid thing.
Like it's just like,

1997
01:47:24.841 --> 01:47:28.440
dude,
comedy is comedy.
They're experimenting.
Maybe it wasn't funny,

1998
01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:33.360
but whatever.
Um,
but just like in like a political debate,

1999
01:47:33.720 --> 01:47:35.850
you know,
if you disagree with someone,

2000
01:47:36.840 --> 01:47:38.730
he challenged him to a fight and then you get yelled at.

2001
01:47:39.780 --> 01:47:43.050
If you disagree with someone,
you should respond.
Right.

2002
01:47:43.300 --> 01:47:45.090
And I'm talking about the girl I'm talking to me right now and then we'll talk

2003
01:47:45.091 --> 01:47:48.330
about the girl who I also does not sound like she would be a lot of fun to hang

2004
01:47:48.331 --> 01:47:53.160
out with.
Um,
and so ever since kind of doing more,

2005
01:47:53.470 --> 01:47:57.510
I'm reading more politics and comedy and getting involved in just different

2006
01:47:57.511 --> 01:48:01.680
communities that weren't comedy,
whether it's Jujitsu,
whether it's,
uh,
politics,

2007
01:48:01.681 --> 01:48:05.940
activism,
whatever,
um,
you know,
as much as comedy,

2008
01:48:05.941 --> 01:48:07.560
I love the arts so much.

2009
01:48:07.710 --> 01:48:11.670
It wasn't this like defend to the death thing as much because I saw that the

2010
01:48:11.671 --> 01:48:14.130
world was like bigger than comedy.

2011
01:48:14.131 --> 01:48:16.200
I think there are a lot of comics who think that like this is it.

2012
01:48:16.201 --> 01:48:20.250
It's all about the comedy community,
you know?
And this is all we got.

2013
01:48:20.340 --> 01:48:22.320
No matter what we do,
we have to like defend our own.

2014
01:48:23.520 --> 01:48:26.970
<v 1>And that's a pretty absolute stance to take,
um,</v>

2015
01:48:27.270 --> 01:48:31.050
in this particular situation though.
Well,
so,
well,
here's what I was to say.

2016
01:48:31.051 --> 01:48:33.800
So here's this,
that's not what anybody is saying.
No,
you're,

2017
01:48:33.801 --> 01:48:38.430
you're sort of building up a straw man defense.
How so?
Well,
you know,

2018
01:48:38.431 --> 01:48:39.660
by saying that,
you know,

2019
01:48:39.661 --> 01:48:42.900
by having someone who's arguing already the point that comedy show,

2020
01:48:42.930 --> 01:48:45.520
that's not new.
What anybody's saying?
No,
no one has a right,

2021
01:48:45.580 --> 01:48:49.350
I'm describing exactly what I used to do,
what I used to think.
I mean me,

2022
01:48:49.380 --> 01:48:52.570
100% May.
Okay,
so you used to think this way,
you,

2023
01:48:52.590 --> 01:48:55.530
you're holding that comedy is most important,

2024
01:48:55.531 --> 01:48:58.800
more important than people's happiness or feelings.
Fuck you.

2025
01:48:59.140 --> 01:49:00.450
Comedy comedy's more important.

2026
01:49:00.451 --> 01:49:03.450
All I knew was comedy when I was not good at comedy.

2027
01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:05.640
Now you disagree and what do you disagree with you?

2028
01:49:05.650 --> 01:49:08.550
So you think that now a woman should be able to say something stupid old

2029
01:49:09.630 --> 01:49:13.230
hecklers.
I hate hecklers.
I think you supported her.
No.

2030
01:49:13.320 --> 01:49:15.960
Over Daniel Tosh and you said,
here's what I said,

2031
01:49:16.500 --> 01:49:19.650
here's how portal heckling before you support rape culture.

2032
01:49:20.350 --> 01:49:23.320
<v 4>That's what she said.
Yes,
100%.
Okay,
but what does that mean?</v>

2033
01:49:23.350 --> 01:49:28.350
So I was heckled for people who like make it like a free speed tissue.

2034
01:49:28.720 --> 01:49:32.020
Of course he has the right to say that.
Uh,
just like,
like

2035
01:49:32.220 --> 01:49:35.190
<v 1>he doesn't just have the right to say it.
It was the thing to say that was funny.</v>

2036
01:49:35.191 --> 01:49:36.540
It's shortly we believed in it.

2037
01:49:36.870 --> 01:49:39.540
It's not like we believed he really wanted people to rape her.

2038
01:49:39.560 --> 01:49:41.880
Of course he was saying something ridiculous and quick.

2039
01:49:41.881 --> 01:49:44.020
Of course that offers top,
where's his head?
Of course not right.

2040
01:49:44.030 --> 01:49:48.310
But 100% agree with it.
100 did you tweet?
Which you tweeted saying that because

2041
01:49:48.550 --> 01:49:52.180
<v 6>when there are one in four girls who had been sexually assaulted or raped,</v>

2042
01:49:52.181 --> 01:49:54.640
and those are just the ones that are reported,
right,

2043
01:49:54.641 --> 01:49:59.080
because it's the most unreported crime we have because largely,
uh,

2044
01:49:59.590 --> 01:50:01.810
people don't,
a lot of people don't take it seriously.

2045
01:50:01.930 --> 01:50:03.960
There's a lot of victim blaming.
There's lunch.

2046
01:50:04.120 --> 01:50:07.810
I wish it was really accurate to describe how many people don't report it,

2047
01:50:07.811 --> 01:50:10.780
but unfortunately it's not.
So when you say one in four,

2048
01:50:10.781 --> 01:50:14.360
there is a lot of fuckery when it comes to numbers like unreported crime.

2049
01:50:14.361 --> 01:50:15.820
So let's not,
and by the way,

2050
01:50:15.821 --> 01:50:18.910
I'm not saying this in that people are not being victimized.

2051
01:50:18.911 --> 01:50:22.570
They unquestionably are.
Right.
I'm saying that when you get into weird numbers,

2052
01:50:22.571 --> 01:50:24.940
like unreported numbers is a reason.
Those are the,

2053
01:50:25.210 --> 01:50:27.470
those are the reported numbers one and four is reports.
One,

2054
01:50:27.490 --> 01:50:31.840
of course we're 25% of all women had been raped or sexually assaulted.
Real.

2055
01:50:32.090 --> 01:50:35.530
It's actually,
it's true.
It's actually,
are you sure about that?
Punch it up.
Okay.

2056
01:50:35.800 --> 01:50:40.330
What percentage of women had been sexually assaulted and a lot of them,
uh,

2057
01:50:40.360 --> 01:50:44.770
and enough
and a lot of them,

2058
01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:49.780
uh,
you know,
we all probably a,
at least statistically know someone who was,

2059
01:50:50.170 --> 01:50:54.700
there's probably someone in the audience who was,
and you know,
Daniel Tosh,

2060
01:50:55.660 --> 01:50:59.650
I think comedian should push boundaries.
100%.
It's close.
It's one in every six.

2061
01:50:59.651 --> 01:51:02.350
It's 14% one.
And every sex,
the one I saw 13%,

2062
01:51:03.010 --> 01:51:06.280
it's a lot and 0.8% attempted rape.

2063
01:51:06.310 --> 01:51:10.660
There's a lot of dudes suck at rape and uh,
there's a lot of pressure.

2064
01:51:10.661 --> 01:51:14.140
You giggled.
That's fucking,
that's,
and you made a,
a tagline to it,

2065
01:51:14.141 --> 01:51:18.050
that's rape jokes.
Highs contributed to rape culture.
Not In fucking MSNBC.

2066
01:51:18.051 --> 01:51:21.510
It talks about I need 15 minutes on rape last night.
But do you see the,

2067
01:51:21.511 --> 01:51:23.520
that which you did by saying that the,

2068
01:51:23.521 --> 01:51:27.010
you would rather someone heckle you then then contribute to rape culture.

2069
01:51:27.280 --> 01:51:29.280
What the fuck is rate?
So I still have to explain this.

2070
01:51:29.770 --> 01:51:33.370
So if we're gonna talk about freedom of speech,

2071
01:51:33.460 --> 01:51:36.340
I in Texas,
uh,

2072
01:51:36.400 --> 01:51:40.420
had a dude literally run to the stage.
It was my closing bit too.

2073
01:51:40.450 --> 01:51:43.270
All you need to do is wait 10 fucking seconds and say if you keep,

2074
01:51:43.271 --> 01:51:46.240
I closed on a thing against the war is said,
if you keep doing that,

2075
01:51:46.241 --> 01:51:49.090
I'm gonna kick your ass.
So that's actually like violating freedom of speech.

2076
01:51:49.120 --> 01:51:52.930
This girl fucking heckled,
the dom heckle and she left.
This dude is saying,

2077
01:51:52.960 --> 01:51:56.980
if you keep talking,
I'm going to kick your ass.
Right?
And I wasn't like,
oh,

2078
01:51:56.981 --> 01:51:59.160
we should have got fucking shot in Iraq.
Right.

2079
01:51:59.300 --> 01:52:04.090
I dealt with how the situation was weird.
Um,
and then,
but this is your situation.

2080
01:52:04.091 --> 01:52:08.480
Let's not confuse the issue by bringing in a whole nother story I talk about,

2081
01:52:08.590 --> 01:52:11.960
I just want to preface it that I fucking low with hecklers and it,

2082
01:52:12.100 --> 01:52:15.590
I've been heckled my entire career,
not just heckling.
You were threatened by it,

2083
01:52:15.850 --> 01:52:18.370
but I've also been heckled.
I've had shit thrown at me.
You know,

2084
01:52:18.371 --> 01:52:23.371
I'm not a fan of body and mind is you support that woman because to me with rape

2085
01:52:24.521 --> 01:52:28.060
culture is the fact that

2086
01:52:29.830 --> 01:52:33.730
because rape is dealt with so lately in this country,
um,

2087
01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:38.410
lots of women don't report it.
Lots of Roman don't report simple sexual assault.

2088
01:52:38.440 --> 01:52:39.640
Fucking dude comes up,

2089
01:52:39.850 --> 01:52:43.660
grabs your tits at a club because she doesn't want to be called a slut.

2090
01:52:43.661 --> 01:52:44.800
She's want to be called drunk.

2091
01:52:44.801 --> 01:52:48.320
She doesn't want to defend herself when she feels like she was assaulted.
Right.

2092
01:52:48.830 --> 01:52:53.570
And so to me in that moment,
as much as I care about comedy,

2093
01:52:54.380 --> 01:52:57.800
you know,
when I started reading a lot of progressive blogs,

2094
01:52:57.801 --> 01:52:58.700
when they talk about rape,

2095
01:52:58.701 --> 01:53:01.550
there's something called a trigger warning at the beginning of the article is

2096
01:53:01.551 --> 01:53:03.530
this trigger warning.
And I never knew what that meant.

2097
01:53:03.531 --> 01:53:07.370
But that means that some girls have been so fucking traumatized or guys have

2098
01:53:07.371 --> 01:53:10.640
been so traumatized after being raped that they can't read about.

2099
01:53:10.641 --> 01:53:12.290
They can't read about it.
They'll have fucking flashbacks.

2100
01:53:12.300 --> 01:53:15.830
So you have to put this trigger warning on top.
And so to me it's like,

2101
01:53:16.220 --> 01:53:18.230
I dunno man,
if it comes down to,

2102
01:53:18.290 --> 01:53:21.590
and there were feminists that I went on TV with like feminist writers who are

2103
01:53:21.591 --> 01:53:26.270
like demonizes,
he's humorless,
cons who were fucking quoting Sarah Silverman,

2104
01:53:26.271 --> 01:53:28.910
the Wanda Sykes rate bit the Carlin rape bit.
You know,

2105
01:53:28.911 --> 01:53:33.200
there are definitely ways to do it.
Um,
but if there a girl in an audience,

2106
01:53:33.201 --> 01:53:34.430
even that girl who heckled,

2107
01:53:34.610 --> 01:53:39.610
if she was fucking raped and even if tosh is totally 100% kidding when she was,

2108
01:53:40.640 --> 01:53:42.710
it says,
when two people are going to get five guys rape you,

2109
01:53:42.830 --> 01:53:47.510
you know what I do think that that girl having a fucking flashback or any girl

2110
01:53:47.511 --> 01:53:51.530
in that audience having a fucking rape flashback,
I'm like,
it's not worth,

2111
01:53:51.890 --> 01:53:53.000
it's not worth the bid.

2112
01:53:53.180 --> 01:53:57.350
And there's so much stuff with rape that you can talk about that you can make

2113
01:53:57.440 --> 01:54:02.420
funny.
Um,
and I think that all topics and comedy should be addressed.

2114
01:54:02.600 --> 01:54:05.690
And I think the best comedians are the ones that can address those really edgy

2115
01:54:05.691 --> 01:54:08.750
topics.
But if it's going to be like a sloppily,

2116
01:54:08.751 --> 01:54:10.220
it would be funny if you were raped.

2117
01:54:10.221 --> 01:54:14.270
And there were almost definitely girls he's constructing.
No,

2118
01:54:14.271 --> 01:54:17.840
he's responding to someone saying something really stupid about rape that

2119
01:54:17.841 --> 01:54:20.960
completely limits the amount of subjects he can respond with.
Well,

2120
01:54:20.961 --> 01:54:24.950
and the has to respond with something that applies to rape,
but again,

2121
01:54:24.980 --> 01:54:27.740
I didn't with the military,
there are tons of other comics who have,

2122
01:54:27.750 --> 01:54:29.180
who have dealt with hecklers,

2123
01:54:29.181 --> 01:54:33.110
who have done it in other ways and you didn't because someone wanted to kick

2124
01:54:33.111 --> 01:54:36.380
your ass.
Someone ran up to the stage of wanting to kick your ass.

2125
01:54:36.470 --> 01:54:37.820
You realize you were in danger.

2126
01:54:37.880 --> 01:54:40.940
That's completely facetious to say that you didn't do it for no reason.
No,

2127
01:54:40.970 --> 01:54:45.350
but I mean I just say that this guy that his,
his idea with him saying,

2128
01:54:45.380 --> 01:54:47.990
don't you think it would be funny if five guys raped her?
Like,
no,

2129
01:54:48.470 --> 01:54:52.550
he's not supporting rape.
If you are that sensitive,

2130
01:54:52.580 --> 01:54:56.360
you do not belong in a comedy club.
If you,
if the word rape,

2131
01:54:56.390 --> 01:55:01.100
we'll send you into a fucking panic.
I feel unfortunate.
I feel sad for you.

2132
01:55:01.101 --> 01:55:03.050
You are very unfortunate that this has happened to you.

2133
01:55:03.140 --> 01:55:05.240
Maybe a comedy club is not the best place for you.

2134
01:55:05.270 --> 01:55:10.270
Maybe you should go somewhere else where it isn't a 100% uncensored ride through

2135
01:55:11.121 --> 01:55:16.121
the mind and imagination of Daniel Tosh and not to be interrupted by a moron.

2136
01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:21.440
And when that Moron does interrupt with something completely non-ironic

2137
01:55:21.650 --> 01:55:26.270
ridiculous,
insane.
He was,
he was saying that rape is bad of course.

2138
01:55:26.300 --> 01:55:29.150
But let's say that she was hypothetically tough shit.

2139
01:55:29.151 --> 01:55:32.690
And this is the one that she should shut her fucking mouth.
The comedy.
If you,

2140
01:55:32.760 --> 01:55:37.580
if you have been traumatized to a situation where you could be fucking enjoying

2141
01:55:37.581 --> 01:55:40.000
your night at the comedy club.
Right.
And I'm not saying this wasn't it,

2142
01:55:40.001 --> 01:55:41.090
we don't know who she is.

2143
01:55:41.840 --> 01:55:45.570
Let's say she was enjoying and at the colony club she was raped at a horrible

2144
01:55:45.571 --> 01:55:48.030
fucking fashion.
Not that there's like a pleasant area.
Unfortunate.

2145
01:55:48.031 --> 01:55:50.670
And if he was saying that just fucking comes out,

2146
01:55:50.940 --> 01:55:52.110
that's just an emotional response.

2147
01:55:52.111 --> 01:55:54.840
You remember like she needs to grow the fuck up.
And that's when when a,

2148
01:55:54.990 --> 01:55:58.140
when a guy says something like that to you and it's gross and everybody laughs

2149
01:55:58.320 --> 01:56:01.260
and it's ridiculous when you don't,
you go home and write a blog.

2150
01:56:01.261 --> 01:56:03.540
You don't need people supporting you because you're an idiot,

2151
01:56:03.570 --> 01:56:07.260
but that's why it happened.
That's Ptsd Shit.
I'm like,
you can't,
if somebody gets,

2152
01:56:07.300 --> 01:56:09.360
she didn't say in her blog that she was raped.

2153
01:56:09.420 --> 01:56:13.050
She said in her blog that she felt offended that he would joke around about ray.

2154
01:56:13.080 --> 01:56:17.700
No,
I was talking about you were saying Ptsd hypothetical.

2155
01:56:18.510 --> 01:56:19.920
Let's say that girl was like,

2156
01:56:19.950 --> 01:56:23.520
if that girl did right then in a blog would be a totally different blog by

2157
01:56:23.521 --> 01:56:27.300
warranting and justifying this more ronic opinion on,
you know,

2158
01:56:27.301 --> 01:56:29.880
someone having an ad lib to deal with a Heckler,

2159
01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:33.740
which what you're doing is you're supporting the idea that the,
the,

2160
01:56:33.800 --> 01:56:38.800
the positive idea behind not raping someone is more important than a show.

2161
01:56:40.170 --> 01:56:41.580
That's more important than jokes.

2162
01:56:41.700 --> 01:56:45.330
It's more important that you never bring up the idea that rape can be funny

2163
01:56:45.360 --> 01:56:48.920
cause that's then you're eliminating that,
that a gap as the opposite.
I said,

2164
01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:52.650
rape can ever be funny.
It can be funny for a Heckler,
but that's again,

2165
01:56:52.680 --> 01:56:56.010
that's the opposite of what I said right now of rape can ever be funny.

2166
01:56:56.011 --> 01:56:57.450
It can be funny when you know a,

2167
01:56:57.451 --> 01:57:01.770
someone is not being serious about it and to someone is talking about her rape

2168
01:57:01.771 --> 01:57:05.550
isn't funny.
That automatically makes it funny if they're a heckler.

2169
01:57:05.700 --> 01:57:10.440
If a heckler talks about rape not being funny ever,
and then the comic says,

2170
01:57:10.530 --> 01:57:13.080
wouldn't it be funny if somebody raped her?
You know,

2171
01:57:13.081 --> 01:57:17.190
he doesn't mean that his intent is not that a bunch of people should storm,

2172
01:57:17.520 --> 01:57:19.890
but that is the correct thing for him to say.
But again,

2173
01:57:19.891 --> 01:57:22.590
dealing with a nightclub comedian and people are drinking alcohol,

2174
01:57:22.591 --> 01:57:24.780
that would be fun.
But I wrote that tweet.

2175
01:57:25.290 --> 01:57:28.230
That was after you see my point at all.
Yes.

2176
01:57:28.680 --> 01:57:30.510
And what's the difference between Miss Rachel rape,

2177
01:57:30.511 --> 01:57:33.600
listening to this podcast on having a flashback right now?
You know,

2178
01:57:33.601 --> 01:57:37.030
we didn't give her any kind of rape warning before this podcast.
You all your,

2179
01:57:37.031 --> 01:57:39.750
you're tough on some crazy rate.

2180
01:57:40.380 --> 01:57:45.090
But I'm also not saying like,
Hey Rachel,
you specifically,
I hope you get raped.

2181
01:57:45.091 --> 01:57:48.000
But she also,
he didn't really mean that she should get raped.

2182
01:57:48.001 --> 01:57:51.150
What he was doing was being a standup comedian and a fucking club.

2183
01:57:51.240 --> 01:57:54.600
We're one person has to chime in there.
Dumb Shit here.

2184
01:57:54.630 --> 01:57:58.650
Here's what I wrote that the,
the tweet you,
when it first happened,

2185
01:57:58.651 --> 01:58:02.100
I w I essentially retweeted the article and said something like,
wow,

2186
01:58:02.101 --> 01:58:05.010
that was fucking shitty cause that's how I felt.

2187
01:58:05.011 --> 01:58:09.360
I didn't care that much about it.
I was like,
Eh,
it's another comic who is,

2188
01:58:09.390 --> 01:58:10.620
you know,
whatever.

2189
01:58:11.310 --> 01:58:14.640
When I started getting really upset and writing the angry or tweets and writing

2190
01:58:14.641 --> 01:58:18.060
more and more about it is when he listened to people who were reading the tweets

2191
01:58:18.061 --> 01:58:22.760
and you're like,
this is a good opportunity.
I am so matching now.
Rape is great,

2192
01:58:22.790 --> 01:58:23.730
but for AP wants to kick butt.

2193
01:58:23.731 --> 01:58:28.731
I just didn't understand why this was like our hill to die on.

2194
01:58:29.640 --> 01:58:31.950
Like comics don't have fucking health insurance.

2195
01:58:32.100 --> 01:58:35.580
Like comics have not really United around much.

2196
01:58:35.820 --> 01:58:37.650
And it was just so bizarre.

2197
01:58:37.651 --> 01:58:41.130
Like people can rally around fucking Dane Cook the next week for the Aurora

2198
01:58:41.140 --> 01:58:44.080
shooting.
You know what I mean?
Like when he made jokes about that,

2199
01:58:44.081 --> 01:58:48.610
like there was no big,
it was just that people were just so,
they just,

2200
01:58:48.790 --> 01:58:50.170
the tweets,
I was getting more crazy.

2201
01:58:50.200 --> 01:58:54.640
I mean I was watching these bloggers who have blogged about being rape
survivors,

2202
01:58:54.790 --> 01:58:58.360
re tweeting these people who like these amateur comics and people like that who

2203
01:58:58.361 --> 01:59:00.610
thought if they fucking tweeted some rape survivor,

2204
01:59:00.611 --> 01:59:03.740
fucking Dan would house should be friends with them or let them like open for

2205
01:59:03.741 --> 01:59:04.870
him.
They were tweeting like,

2206
01:59:04.880 --> 01:59:08.220
I hope you get raped and just like more fucking rape threats.
Right.

2207
01:59:08.260 --> 01:59:11.500
Will you introduce yourself into the argument again,

2208
01:59:11.530 --> 01:59:14.800
you introduced yourself and your opinion into the argument.
So you were judged.

2209
01:59:14.980 --> 01:59:19.310
You said that you feel you would rather be heckled,

2210
01:59:19.330 --> 01:59:23.190
then contribute to rape culture.
You introduced you oh yeah.
Until the argument.

2211
01:59:23.191 --> 01:59:27.010
So of course that of course you're going to get whiplash.

2212
01:59:27.040 --> 01:59:28.850
Of course you're going to get,
no,
I'm asking about me.

2213
01:59:28.910 --> 01:59:32.620
I'm saying that when you have these,
no,
I actually didn't get it that bad.

2214
01:59:32.621 --> 01:59:35.190
I mean this is the first time you said you did.
You were just telling us no,
no,

2215
01:59:35.191 --> 01:59:36.220
no.
I said bloggers,

2216
01:59:36.221 --> 01:59:39.790
feminist bloggers who have written about being rape survivors were getting raped

2217
01:59:39.791 --> 01:59:43.420
threats.
But you,
you got a lot of like Shitty tweets too.
I mean,
I got some,

2218
01:59:43.450 --> 01:59:47.560
I got some shitty tweets.
Yeah,
for sure.
But like that's what you're not shot.

2219
01:59:47.590 --> 01:59:51.280
It's not about,
no,
cause I,
I wouldn't no point was I trying to make this one,

2220
01:59:51.281 --> 01:59:54.340
the Jonah Goldberg name is one thing,
but this I wasn't trying to make about me.

2221
01:59:54.340 --> 01:59:56.440
I just want to Goldberg and that's the other guys to do.
Yeah.

2222
01:59:56.680 --> 02:00:01.680
I just wanted the people who follow me to know that like,

2223
02:00:02.291 --> 02:00:06.430
because most comics,
uh,
defended it.

2224
02:00:06.790 --> 02:00:10.570
And so I just wanted to,
I just wanted girls to know that I'm like,
you know,

2225
02:00:10.571 --> 02:00:13.660
if you've been through this,
like I don't,
I don't think that's funny.

2226
02:00:13.770 --> 02:00:18.520
I hope never funny,
real rape,
unless it's at the all starts to work.
It's just a,

2227
02:00:18.521 --> 02:00:19.750
it's just a piece of work.

2228
02:00:20.740 --> 02:00:25.240
I started writing about writing about ray environment of a standup comedy club

2229
02:00:25.241 --> 02:00:28.570
where he's being forced to live ad Lib.
But again,
when I,

2230
02:00:28.830 --> 02:00:30.400
we started talking about rape culture,

2231
02:00:30.401 --> 02:00:34.630
it wasn't specifically when I halfheartedly retweeted the Gawker article about

2232
02:00:34.631 --> 02:00:35.350
Taj,

2233
02:00:35.350 --> 02:00:40.350
it was about the responses that people started to get that were so violent and

2234
02:00:40.901 --> 02:00:42.100
not in a comedy club setting,

2235
02:00:42.101 --> 02:00:46.150
but just like personal fucking threats that a lot of the girl journalist and my

2236
02:00:46.151 --> 02:00:49.240
timeline we're re tweeting about just dude saying like,

2237
02:00:49.300 --> 02:00:52.150
so they would say something critical Taj [inaudible] and they would say we

2238
02:00:52.151 --> 02:00:53.560
usually get fucking raped.
Right.

2239
02:00:53.561 --> 02:00:57.080
And it was just that say something critical about toss wouldn't journalists
like,

2240
02:00:57.340 --> 02:01:00.790
so like what were they saying that just like wrote a piece about it and like

2241
02:01:00.791 --> 02:01:03.510
would contrast like with Tosh said to like the Wanda Sykes rape joke of the

2242
02:01:03.511 --> 02:01:07.090
Carlin rape joke and like they analyzed it because that's your job,
fucking dumb.

2243
02:01:07.091 --> 02:01:10.690
They have to be to actually analyze that.
The whole thing is so simple.

2244
02:01:10.740 --> 02:01:15.130
But I'm like that,
that's what they do.
Their media critics,
they,
uh,
he,

2245
02:01:15.340 --> 02:01:16.810
they analyze like that's just what they do.

2246
02:01:16.811 --> 02:01:19.840
They write about popular and a lot of times they do it because that was their

2247
02:01:19.841 --> 02:01:24.841
job and they need something to talk about is the risk of staff might not

2248
02:01:25.481 --> 02:01:28.750
necessarily be logical,
but the response isn't necessarily be like,

2249
02:01:29.160 --> 02:01:31.840
I'm going to tell that person.
I hope they get raped.
You know what I mean?

2250
02:01:31.840 --> 02:01:34.000
Like that's just one of those things where it's just like,

2251
02:01:35.500 --> 02:01:39.460
I have written stuff that's Sony people disagree with.
I've never gotten raped.

2252
02:01:39.461 --> 02:01:43.350
Threats,
you've probably never gotten buckle up.
Uh,

2253
02:01:43.910 --> 02:01:47.420
you're going to get some desk squad seven today.
You live in,
look,

2254
02:01:47.421 --> 02:01:50.950
check your Twitter.
Since we've been on this podcast,
it's common sun.

2255
02:01:50.980 --> 02:01:55.880
It's just in one big letter just says rape,
rape,
rape,
40 characters.

2256
02:01:56.090 --> 02:01:58.250
But uh,
but yeah,
man,
I'm like,

2257
02:01:58.700 --> 02:02:01.820
I just don't think we know what that's like where it's like journalists,

2258
02:02:02.640 --> 02:02:06.860
they don't know what it's like trying to get through a fucking show on Friday

2259
02:02:06.860 --> 02:02:09.590
night and some dummy has to yell out something stupid.
It doesn't make sense.

2260
02:02:09.620 --> 02:02:13.670
Right.
Again,
I'm like,
you can deal with that.
But it's no,
you're not

2261
02:02:15.320 --> 02:02:17.600
dealt with it.
And in my opinion,
he dealt with it the right way.

2262
02:02:17.750 --> 02:02:22.070
And that's not being pro rape,
just being words.
These are words,

2263
02:02:22.100 --> 02:02:25.430
there's you're not,
it's not actions and it's not in supportive rape in any way,

2264
02:02:25.431 --> 02:02:28.820
shape or fashion.
It's a joke.
And if you can't realize he's joking,

2265
02:02:28.821 --> 02:02:32.320
you are unfit to listen to other human beings taught.
No ma'am.

2266
02:02:33.040 --> 02:02:36.140
If you're influenced by that,
if you're influenced by Daniel tosh thing,

2267
02:02:36.141 --> 02:02:37.700
would it be funny if she got raped by five people?

2268
02:02:37.850 --> 02:02:38.900
If you were influenced by that,

2269
02:02:39.050 --> 02:02:44.050
you are clearly mentally incapable of communicating with people.

2270
02:02:44.520 --> 02:02:46.250
Man.
It should be removed from the side.

2271
02:02:46.260 --> 02:02:48.950
Both me and you have heard jokes that were like,
that sucks.

2272
02:02:48.951 --> 02:02:51.170
That wasn't a bad joke dude.
Right?
No,
no,
no.

2273
02:02:51.240 --> 02:02:54.890
I'm saying everyone is subjective and if you've been through a certain thing in

2274
02:02:54.891 --> 02:02:55.220
your life,

2275
02:02:55.220 --> 02:02:57.500
if you've been threatened with rape or if you had been raped or have you been

2276
02:02:57.501 --> 02:03:00.770
assault or if you live in a culture where a lot of fucking girls were raped,

2277
02:03:00.950 --> 02:03:04.160
that you know you have to think about walking home by yourself and shit like

2278
02:03:04.161 --> 02:03:07.370
that.
Maybe that Shit's not as funny to you and that's okay.

2279
02:03:07.371 --> 02:03:11.330
Just like it's okay for him to,
to,
to,
to say what he wants to say.

2280
02:03:11.620 --> 02:03:13.730
It's okay for that girl to get offended.

2281
02:03:13.731 --> 02:03:15.710
It's okay for me not to think it's fucking funny.

2282
02:03:15.770 --> 02:03:17.720
It's okay for you to think it was the right thing to say.

2283
02:03:17.721 --> 02:03:21.740
Like all of this stuff is fine.
I'm just saying that if I were given the choice,

2284
02:03:21.980 --> 02:03:26.300
not in this tough situation because everything I wrote and dude,

2285
02:03:26.301 --> 02:03:30.950
you criticized it and said that you sometimes are embarrassed of your gender.

2286
02:03:31.580 --> 02:03:33.720
Of course I am.
When you have,
when you,

2287
02:03:33.830 --> 02:03:38.830
when you have girls that are afraid to go to the fucking park because they're

2288
02:03:39.441 --> 02:03:42.200
going to get raped.
Yeah,
guys can be fucking creepy.
Right.

2289
02:03:42.201 --> 02:03:46.280
But that's when you have skewed hold on.
Stop.
First of all,

2290
02:03:46.430 --> 02:03:51.290
if you say that one in six,
does that mean one in six men?
Rape is,

2291
02:03:51.291 --> 02:03:54.140
that doesn't mean that as well because if that's the case,

2292
02:03:54.141 --> 02:03:59.141
I was embarrassed about that part of humanity but not my fucking gender.

2293
02:03:59.780 --> 02:04:03.200
That's ridiculous.
A comic you've used like hyperbole.
It's fucking Twitter.

2294
02:04:03.260 --> 02:04:04.210
Exactly what this is.

2295
02:04:04.220 --> 02:04:08.450
Why him saying that someone being raped by five people being funny should also,

2296
02:04:08.451 --> 02:04:11.790
what did he say?
Seven seven she wouldn't know.
You said five touch the,

2297
02:04:12.050 --> 02:04:13.220
I was waiting for you to be like,

2298
02:04:13.460 --> 02:04:17.470
oh you had an insert that 70 fucking shoe with a waterfall.

2299
02:04:17.490 --> 02:04:18.610
There is new things,

2300
02:04:18.611 --> 02:04:21.590
so seven there is part of me hoping that you would be like seven.

2301
02:04:21.610 --> 02:04:23.990
Oh He's a child with a child.

2302
02:04:24.020 --> 02:04:28.190
I was semi praying for him to say 17 you'd be like seven now that's you saying

2303
02:04:28.191 --> 02:04:31.340
that.
Did you know that I should be able to recognize her verbally.

2304
02:04:31.490 --> 02:04:33.250
Why don't you recognize it with tosh thing?

2305
02:04:33.260 --> 02:04:37.070
You should be read by five do cause I'm a fucking comedian.
Right.

2306
02:04:37.080 --> 02:04:38.070
Then why you ever

2307
02:04:38.070 --> 02:04:41.420
<v 4>supporting him?
Because I wreck.
I recognize that me personally,</v>

2308
02:04:41.430 --> 02:04:44.280
just like you recognize it,
just like I recognize that religion is silly.

2309
02:04:44.281 --> 02:04:45.230
You do your thing,

2310
02:04:45.240 --> 02:04:48.600
you're protecting the world from idiots being influenced by not protecting the

2311
02:04:48.601 --> 02:04:48.781
world.

2312
02:04:48.781 --> 02:04:52.230
I'm voicing my opinion that if I had the choice between there's a fucking rape

2313
02:04:52.231 --> 02:04:56.160
survivor there who could get a triggered flashback or like,
you know,

2314
02:04:56.610 --> 02:04:59.220
talk about rape in a different way.
Because again,

2315
02:04:59.250 --> 02:05:02.430
like I don't think it's fucking funny.
I've already burned the comedy bridges.

2316
02:05:02.431 --> 02:05:06.120
You might as well go all the way with it.
I don't think it's funny to personally,

2317
02:05:06.210 --> 02:05:11.040
I think it's easy and I think it's a cop out to joke about people who are

2318
02:05:11.041 --> 02:05:15.020
already shit on to me,
I don't think it's edgy.
I don't think you can

2319
02:05:15.290 --> 02:05:20.090
<v 5>paraphrase fucking prior rape,
rape,
rape survivors.
Well,
okay,</v>

2320
02:05:20.091 --> 02:05:22.910
but you're saying rape survivor when he made a rape joke.

2321
02:05:23.030 --> 02:05:26.390
She's not a rape survivor man.
No,
I'm saying in the audience,

2322
02:05:26.480 --> 02:05:27.530
but she is the victim.

2323
02:05:27.531 --> 02:05:31.040
She's the person who got said that word audience right now of this podcast

2324
02:05:31.041 --> 02:05:34.820
though.
There's tons of fucking people probably sitting around shaking.
Yeah.

2325
02:05:34.850 --> 02:05:37.940
You don't have a problem with that.
This is a bullshit argument really.
It,

2326
02:05:38.160 --> 02:05:41.610
<v 4>we're actually like talking about the issue because it's an issue that's</v>

2327
02:05:41.670 --> 02:05:43.110
important to be talked about.
Again,

2328
02:05:43.500 --> 02:05:46.380
I didn't read anyone and I certainly wasn't saying anyone you can't talk about,

2329
02:05:46.381 --> 02:05:46.640
right.
Yeah.

2330
02:05:46.640 --> 02:05:51.110
<v 5>Don't murder is horrible.
Robbery is horrible.
Armed robbery,</v>

2331
02:05:51.111 --> 02:05:56.090
car robbery,
uh,
everything is horrible.
It doesn't mean just because it exists.

2332
02:05:56.091 --> 02:05:59.360
You can never talk about out of fear when someone,

2333
02:05:59.370 --> 02:06:03.050
someone in the audience may not have a caring when someone gets fucking
murdered,

2334
02:06:03.051 --> 02:06:04.070
you're not like,
well,
what was she?

2335
02:06:04.100 --> 02:06:05.780
What was he wearing like before he got murdered?

2336
02:06:05.781 --> 02:06:08.870
Like rape is the one is listened to your,
that's bullshit.

2337
02:06:08.871 --> 02:06:11.930
Because if somebody gets murdered,
someone can say,
you shouldn't been in there.

2338
02:06:11.931 --> 02:06:12.860
He should have been the neighborhood.

2339
02:06:12.861 --> 02:06:15.140
And what if the person who knows the person who's been murdered,

2340
02:06:15.141 --> 02:06:17.420
who had to work in a bad place to support their family?

2341
02:06:17.540 --> 02:06:22.100
Here's you say that it's the same fucking subject when you're joking around on

2342
02:06:22.101 --> 02:06:24.440
stage,
especially in a situation where touched it,

2343
02:06:24.590 --> 02:06:29.270
where it's a complete ad Lib for you to analyze it in that way and come up with

2344
02:06:29.271 --> 02:06:31.840
he's contributing to rape culture is proposed.

2345
02:06:32.640 --> 02:06:33.990
<v 4>I,
I still,</v>

2346
02:06:34.050 --> 02:06:39.030
I still stand by it because I just don't give a shit again and comparison.

2347
02:06:39.031 --> 02:06:40.890
And this isn't a heckler issue for me anymore.

2348
02:06:40.891 --> 02:06:44.880
Like I don't like people who hack all right.
I hate it.
I hate it.

2349
02:06:46.050 --> 02:06:50.370
And I don't think that Daniel tosh wanted that girl to get raped.
Right.

2350
02:06:50.880 --> 02:06:55.880
But I just don't give a shit about comedy enough that if I'm onstage and I say

2351
02:06:57.931 --> 02:07:01.260
something that could cause someone in the audience or multiple people in the

2352
02:07:01.261 --> 02:07:06.261
audience because I'm not doing it in a way that's attacking,

2353
02:07:06.330 --> 02:07:08.710
I dunno,
like a higher,
like no one's sitting around and being like,
you know,

2354
02:07:08.711 --> 02:07:10.590
he's had it too good for too long a rape victims.

2355
02:07:10.740 --> 02:07:12.390
Like I wish someone would fucking talk about them.

2356
02:07:12.391 --> 02:07:17.391
Like I just think there are smarter ways to fucking do it and I'm not a fan of

2357
02:07:17.791 --> 02:07:17.920
it.
Yeah.

2358
02:07:17.920 --> 02:07:19.790
<v 5>And if I have it,
what if he said,
oh,
I would have,</v>

2359
02:07:19.791 --> 02:07:21.910
I would hope the chimps would eat your face.

2360
02:07:22.320 --> 02:07:25.140
<v 4>Is that okay?
Well,
because we don't have a history.</v>

2361
02:07:25.270 --> 02:07:28.720
<v 5>Is that a man getting,
but there's one in six girls haven't had their facing.</v>

2362
02:07:28.721 --> 02:07:31.630
What if that woman in the audience was in the audience who've got her face eaten

2363
02:07:31.631 --> 02:07:36.010
up by a chimp and everybody laughed.
Hahahaha would be

2364
02:07:36.010 --> 02:07:36.611
<v 6>so funny.</v>

2365
02:07:36.611 --> 02:07:41.500
Tragical she got her face writ bitten up by where women are afraid to go to the

2366
02:07:41.501 --> 02:07:43.930
police to report a fucking chimp incident cause they're gonna be like,
well,

2367
02:07:43.931 --> 02:07:47.320
did you use to fuck the chimp drinking when you were getting together with the

2368
02:07:47.321 --> 02:07:51.460
chimp?
And that is to me,
when I say culture,

2369
02:07:51.790 --> 02:07:53.530
I'm not talking about Daniel Tosh.

2370
02:07:53.531 --> 02:07:55.330
I'm not talking about a comic who talks about rape.

2371
02:07:55.510 --> 02:08:00.510
I'm saying that it was just so fucking bizarre to me that with all of the Shit,

2372
02:08:01.380 --> 02:08:04.390
uh,
the comics have not gathered around that.

2373
02:08:04.391 --> 02:08:06.400
It was like the rape joke.

2374
02:08:06.550 --> 02:08:11.450
Like I just like an Austin come with,
they gathered around,
I don't know,

2375
02:08:11.470 --> 02:08:15.670
man.
I gathered around someone protesting him,

2376
02:08:15.820 --> 02:08:20.750
shutting down a heckler and saying that rape is completely off subject.
But no,

2377
02:08:20.940 --> 02:08:24.170
no.
I went on a fucking liberal

2378
02:08:25.670 --> 02:08:28.240
by,
hold on,
wait,
I went on a liberal.
That's why it happened.

2379
02:08:28.450 --> 02:08:30.910
That's why the whole thing happened.
They brought on as some moron,
right?

2380
02:08:31.690 --> 02:08:35.860
Hecklers are morons right now.
She's like,
again,

2381
02:08:36.120 --> 02:08:40.390
get heckled a heckler that didn't even understand what he was saying.
Sure.

2382
02:08:40.900 --> 02:08:44.680
But again,
if I were raped,

2383
02:08:45.220 --> 02:08:49.930
maybe I would act quickly and hastily,
uh,

2384
02:08:49.931 --> 02:08:54.100
about a subject that's affected my life so much and such a tragic way.
And again,

2385
02:08:54.590 --> 02:08:57.610
that's what makes us happy.
If I was,

2386
02:08:57.760 --> 02:09:00.460
she didn't write that in our blog and that's what everybody responded,

2387
02:09:00.480 --> 02:09:03.590
just became an issue because she wrote this blog,
right.

2388
02:09:03.610 --> 02:09:06.430
That's why it became an issue,
sending the blog off to these websites.

2389
02:09:06.431 --> 02:09:09.850
It was her fucking personal blog.
Yeah.
But if you fucking be clean viral,

2390
02:09:09.851 --> 02:09:13.120
and that's why it became an issue that you talked.
Sure.
But again,

2391
02:09:13.180 --> 02:09:16.240
like you keep saying that like,
I don't think rape should ever be mentioned.

2392
02:09:16.240 --> 02:09:19.570
Like the feminist saying that you think rape can be funny.
Right.

2393
02:09:19.571 --> 02:09:22.720
You think that one is licensing it and make it funny?
100% okay.

2394
02:09:22.721 --> 02:09:24.220
Why didn't Tosh make it funny there?

2395
02:09:24.221 --> 02:09:28.840
It sounded funny to me because it was used in the same way that rape is used in

2396
02:09:28.841 --> 02:09:30.940
the sense just to shut someone up.
It was you.

2397
02:09:31.360 --> 02:09:35.680
It was rape is not used to shut the up.
That's a crazy way to shut people up.

2398
02:09:35.710 --> 02:09:39.220
It's a pouch.
Shut up.
I'm going to rape.
You know?
But it's no,
but I mean,

2399
02:09:39.221 --> 02:09:41.970
it's psychologically been proved that it's not about being a coach.
It's not,

2400
02:09:42.010 --> 02:09:45.490
it's not about being a horny.
It's a crime.
It's a psychological crime.

2401
02:09:45.760 --> 02:09:49.570
That's a crazy comparison and I don't buy that either.
It's about both.

2402
02:09:49.750 --> 02:09:52.210
If it was just about controlling someone,
they would hold you down.

2403
02:09:52.240 --> 02:09:55.780
They fuck you because it's power and sexual at the same time.

2404
02:09:55.840 --> 02:09:59.380
I don't think we'll have some creepy thing when it comes to physically

2405
02:09:59.381 --> 02:10:00.214
empowering,

2406
02:10:00.610 --> 02:10:05.520
being physically overpowering a person and and and fucking them and had ax with

2407
02:10:05.530 --> 02:10:08.590
them.
My whole thing is like,
I'm a comic.
I've been heckled.

2408
02:10:08.591 --> 02:10:11.920
I know what it's like to be heckled.
I'm not a female.
I haven't been raped.

2409
02:10:12.010 --> 02:10:17.010
I don't know what it's like and if it comes down to a fucking dude who was not

2410
02:10:17.201 --> 02:10:20.140
censored,
who still has his number one show on comedy central,

2411
02:10:20.230 --> 02:10:23.770
who still plays at the club?
No one.
Oh look.
A lot of people wanted them censored.

2412
02:10:23.980 --> 02:10:27.060
A lot of people wanted him fire.
The cared for him to get fired.
I didn't call.

2413
02:10:28.490 --> 02:10:31.750
I just call fucking station.
I it because it's not my fucking job.

2414
02:10:31.810 --> 02:10:34.070
You said support a comic.
Just because I happened

2415
02:10:34.070 --> 02:10:37.670
<v 5>to be a comedian when I don't,
but you said he's contributing to rape culture.</v>

2416
02:10:37.820 --> 02:10:40.640
I think that whole situation,
100% I think what we're doing,

2417
02:10:40.641 --> 02:10:42.500
I think right now making,

2418
02:10:43.220 --> 02:10:46.610
putting the onus on women that they're uptight bitches.

2419
02:10:47.550 --> 02:10:50.830
Do you know what a slippery slope the says that you are.

2420
02:10:50.840 --> 02:10:53.120
You are literally condoning censorship.

2421
02:10:53.150 --> 02:10:56.720
You're saying that people's words can affect actions.

2422
02:10:56.810 --> 02:11:01.400
So you're saying someone completely joking around about rape,
Ken support.
Rape.

2423
02:11:01.610 --> 02:11:05.810
It is ridiculous.
It is dickless statement but that's not it.

2424
02:11:06.170 --> 02:11:09.440
That's what you're saying.
That is what you're saying.
Listen man,

2425
02:11:09.560 --> 02:11:14.000
if you say that he's contributing the rape culture by saying that with his
mouth,

2426
02:11:14.060 --> 02:11:18.680
by joking around in a way that absolutely,
well no,
he wasn't serious.
Five guys,

2427
02:11:19.010 --> 02:11:21.920
five guys just going to jump out and raid better.
But again,
that would be funny.

2428
02:11:22.010 --> 02:11:24.470
That's not what he's saying.
He's making a joke.

2429
02:11:24.471 --> 02:11:26.690
And you're saying that contributes to rape culture.

2430
02:11:26.691 --> 02:11:31.310
So what you're saying is his words should be censored because they contribute to

2431
02:11:31.800 --> 02:11:32.300
bullshit.

2432
02:11:32.300 --> 02:11:35.630
You're saying they contribute to racial shit cause I never said take him off the

2433
02:11:35.631 --> 02:11:39.560
air.
I never said so he has to sell.
You're still saying he contributes to rape?

2434
02:11:39.650 --> 02:11:42.560
No,
I didn't say a contributor as in rape culture.
Right,
because what fucking,

2435
02:11:42.561 --> 02:11:44.440
what does that mean?
If he's not contributing to rate?

2436
02:11:44.450 --> 02:11:48.200
You go on fucking Twitter during those days and all of his fans started

2437
02:11:48.201 --> 02:11:50.990
threatening girls with rape.
That's fucking rape culture.

2438
02:11:51.080 --> 02:11:55.760
Rape Culture is women being in constant fucking fear because dudes are fucking

2439
02:11:55.761 --> 02:11:58.310
threatening them because dudes are writing and say,
well,

2440
02:11:58.311 --> 02:12:01.370
I see you where you fucking live,
I'm going to rape you.
That is rape culture,

2441
02:12:01.600 --> 02:12:03.710
right?
Culture Dude,
that's idiots.

2442
02:12:03.740 --> 02:12:07.040
This idea that he is somehow or another contributing to that by even mentioning

2443
02:12:07.041 --> 02:12:07.874
the word rape,

2444
02:12:07.940 --> 02:12:12.740
you can't stop someone from being a fucking idiot and by not saying a joke about

2445
02:12:12.770 --> 02:12:17.770
a subject doesn't keep other morons from using that subject whenever they freely

2446
02:12:17.871 --> 02:12:18.770
want,
right?
It's just,

2447
02:12:18.771 --> 02:12:23.540
it comes up at any time they're allowed to have their reactions and start
saying,

2448
02:12:23.541 --> 02:12:25.280
oh,
I'm gonna to a group.
You Bitch,

2449
02:12:25.460 --> 02:12:27.590
that doesn't mean you should never talk about rape.

2450
02:12:27.800 --> 02:12:29.870
And so for you to say that in that moment,

2451
02:12:29.871 --> 02:12:33.380
he shouldn't bring it up cause he's contributing to a bunch of fucking apes

2452
02:12:33.560 --> 02:12:36.320
yelling rape at women on Twitter or Facebook or whatever.

2453
02:12:36.500 --> 02:12:40.880
They're completely unrelated,
completely unrelated and not have done it.

2454
02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:43.490
If there wasn't so much fucking know those dudes would not have done.

2455
02:12:43.491 --> 02:12:46.790
If there wasn't a fucking blog written by some one woman who all of a sudden

2456
02:12:46.791 --> 02:12:49.160
everybody and you had to comment on,

2457
02:12:49.400 --> 02:12:54.290
then it becomes a part of the national discourse.
Same Shit.
We're fucking fault.

2458
02:12:54.291 --> 02:12:56.780
Like if that kick it is,
well,
it's true.
It is her fault.

2459
02:12:56.781 --> 02:13:00.320
She should have shut her fucking mouth one and she should not run a dumb blog

2460
02:13:00.321 --> 02:13:01.031
about it.
I don't know,

2461
02:13:01.031 --> 02:13:04.010
man diarrhea of the mouth blog about it where she didn't take any personal

2462
02:13:04.011 --> 02:13:08.360
accountability for interrupting a show with a fucking rabid standup comedian in

2463
02:13:08.361 --> 02:13:10.550
mid stride,
in his fucking prime,

2464
02:13:10.730 --> 02:13:13.790
on stage in Hollywood on a Friday night or Saturday night,

2465
02:13:13.800 --> 02:13:16.340
whatever the fuck it was.
I Dunno,
Dude.
This is what it is.
Okay,

2466
02:13:16.341 --> 02:13:19.640
she's interrupting the show.
You're caught in the crossfire.
You took a hit.

2467
02:13:19.760 --> 02:13:21.050
It wasn't real dummy.

2468
02:13:21.080 --> 02:13:24.170
If he said he hopes a unicorn comes down and drowns you with his pice,

2469
02:13:24.350 --> 02:13:27.710
is that real?
Come on.
It's,
we're not talking reality here.

2470
02:13:27.711 --> 02:13:31.240
We're talking jokes one and he's not contributing through has been drawn by a

2471
02:13:31.241 --> 02:13:35.940
Unicorn,
Unicorn pissed,
Yada Chrome has,
I'm sorry,
I,
it's,
it's nonsense.

2472
02:13:35.970 --> 02:13:36.840
It's nonsense.

2473
02:13:36.910 --> 02:13:39.570
<v 2>And how many of these people that unreported,
like the Wah Wah,</v>

2474
02:13:39.620 --> 02:13:43.920
one out of seven or whatever,
people didn't report it because they had orgasms.

2475
02:13:43.940 --> 02:13:47.260
There could be some kind of weird fucking number like that in there that just

2476
02:13:47.261 --> 02:13:49.190
totally voids the whole number anyway.
Okay,

2477
02:13:49.910 --> 02:13:53.710
<v 5>well that might not be it.
I'm going to see all that that hey</v>

2478
02:13:55.700 --> 02:13:57.350
Jamie,
you,
you know,

2479
02:13:57.351 --> 02:14:01.790
I think if anything makes people say stupid shit,

2480
02:14:01.791 --> 02:14:03.140
like I hope you get raped.

2481
02:14:03.470 --> 02:14:07.700
It's when people stand up for someone who says something like rape should never

2482
02:14:07.701 --> 02:14:11.000
be talked about but,
or like rape should have been discussed.

2483
02:14:11.990 --> 02:14:16.010
But like we,
you're talking about Roy,
a rape culture.

2484
02:14:16.160 --> 02:14:18.890
So whenever you step in and say,

2485
02:14:18.891 --> 02:14:23.360
I support this over rape culture,
there's a bunch of idiots who you are,

2486
02:14:23.361 --> 02:14:28.361
you're introducing yourself into the sea of humanity and you're shocked when

2487
02:14:28.761 --> 02:14:32.180
some people bounce back at,
you know,
but shot because that's what you're doing.

2488
02:14:32.210 --> 02:14:34.760
You're introducing,
your idea's going to have one.

2489
02:14:35.070 --> 02:14:39.710
I'm like one of like five comedians who said something that we're the reason

2490
02:14:39.740 --> 02:14:42.020
that these girls started getting rape threats.
Like that's crazy.

2491
02:14:42.021 --> 02:14:43.040
That's not what I'm saying at all.

2492
02:14:43.040 --> 02:14:46.340
I'm saying that you said that Daniel tosh contributes to rape culture and I'm

2493
02:14:46.341 --> 02:14:49.310
telling the whole situation.
I thought that's true.
What did you mean?

2494
02:14:49.390 --> 02:14:53.230
What did you entering the discourse that actually contributed to by people

2495
02:14:53.710 --> 02:14:55.010
distribute it to people who think,

2496
02:14:55.370 --> 02:14:58.790
who people who get annoyed at like lefty vegans and they want to go,

2497
02:14:58.791 --> 02:15:02.260
you fucking queer hope you get rid of,
but that was fat.
You're right,

2498
02:15:02.380 --> 02:15:04.220
you're right.
Shit.
Anyway,
but they those people,

2499
02:15:04.221 --> 02:15:07.340
isn't that your rape culture though?
They weren't saying that to me.

2500
02:15:07.370 --> 02:15:08.360
They were saying that the fire,

2501
02:15:08.370 --> 02:15:13.060
I'm sure check your timeline now they are and I'm sure they said it then

2502
02:15:13.580 --> 02:15:14.061
anybody.

2503
02:15:14.061 --> 02:15:18.440
I sure a certain amount of people who read what you said had some sort of a

2504
02:15:18.441 --> 02:15:21.830
negative response to you.
There's no denying that.
Right?

2505
02:15:22.100 --> 02:15:25.430
Luckily a lot of your people who are mad at me,
I just checked my Twitter.

2506
02:15:25.820 --> 02:15:30.230
They're not putting a period before my name,
so it's only,

2507
02:15:30.231 --> 02:15:35.000
it's only going to me.
It's like kills.
Hey everyone,
uh,
pure idiot.

2508
02:15:35.220 --> 02:15:38.780
Oh,
they have to put a period before you.
Otherwise it only goes,
yeah,
they,

2509
02:15:38.850 --> 02:15:40.970
I think they want to talk to you,
dude.
Oh,
that sounds kind of funny.

2510
02:15:41.270 --> 02:15:43.880
Jamie Kelsey and beat me up in a kickboxing match and them rape me and then

2511
02:15:43.881 --> 02:15:48.830
Hashtag the rape culture.
But do you feel me on this man?

2512
02:15:48.831 --> 02:15:49.341
Do you know what I'm trying,

2513
02:15:49.341 --> 02:15:52.250
I'm trying to put some sense in your head because you're being silly and you're

2514
02:15:52.251 --> 02:15:56.750
opening yourself up to unwarranted and unnecessary criticism can be avoided.

2515
02:15:56.900 --> 02:16:01.370
It can all be avoided by being a little bit harder on yourself.
Man.
I don't know.

2516
02:16:01.371 --> 02:16:04.580
Not,
not introducing yourself into these,
these things.
I mean,

2517
02:16:05.650 --> 02:16:09.980
and this all,
I mean,
your people already think,
uh,
I miss on my people.

2518
02:16:10.170 --> 02:16:12.800
I'm not running a cult.
No,
no,
no.
I don't have.
Yeah,

2519
02:16:12.840 --> 02:16:17.090
they're there by a town and go to Portland.

2520
02:16:18.030 --> 02:16:22.160
I had way too many,
uh,
forgettable starting Colton,
Portland.

2521
02:16:22.730 --> 02:16:24.500
That's the place that here you got way too many white.

2522
02:16:24.570 --> 02:16:28.060
I have way too many people who were raped who tweeted me and was like,
ah,

2523
02:16:28.061 --> 02:16:31.510
you got a cop.
They'll be happy.
If you talk about fucking water socking,

2524
02:16:32.180 --> 02:16:35.380
you talk about a certain amount of things is that we're going to be a giant

2525
02:16:35.381 --> 02:16:39.470
group of people that support you.
It doesn't mean that you're right.
I mean,

2526
02:16:39.490 --> 02:16:42.850
we're going to disagree on this,
right?
For sure.
Disagree on this.

2527
02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:46.360
Every fucking committee in the world disagrees with you,
but I'm like,

2528
02:16:46.361 --> 02:16:46.990
I don't care.

2529
02:16:46.990 --> 02:16:51.310
You know what that is though as a common comment that you understand what's

2530
02:16:51.311 --> 02:16:55.090
going on.
It's not the comedy means much to you.
It's in human interaction,
man.

2531
02:16:55.240 --> 02:16:58.870
It's when you're at a movie and some guy's on his fucking phone talking,
shut up,

2532
02:16:58.871 --> 02:17:02.080
bitch.
You're fucking up the show.
It's real simple,
right?

2533
02:17:02.110 --> 02:17:06.220
That's what tosh did is stop what was fucking up the show.

2534
02:17:06.221 --> 02:17:09.300
It had nothing to do with rape or contributing to rape culture.

2535
02:17:09.340 --> 02:17:11.230
Like when something like what you just said happens,

2536
02:17:11.231 --> 02:17:14.990
like people don't galvanize around that.
You know what I mean?
They shouldn't,

2537
02:17:15.210 --> 02:17:18.370
they should galvanize around putting a picture of her and say,
see this bitch.

2538
02:17:18.490 --> 02:17:21.880
She doesn't understand humor.
She can't take a joke.

2539
02:17:21.970 --> 02:17:26.080
So she'd be a photo of her with a red line across her face until you can come in

2540
02:17:26.170 --> 02:17:30.430
and explain to us that you're sorry that you didn't understand how he was joking

2541
02:17:30.431 --> 02:17:34.540
around about it and nothing can be funny about rape and you just blurted it out

2542
02:17:34.541 --> 02:17:37.960
because you're a self righteous dummy who thinks that you should be able to

2543
02:17:38.260 --> 02:17:42.160
espouse your politically correct opinions at any fucking time.

2544
02:17:42.160 --> 02:17:45.940
They're warranted in your silly little fucking dumb mine and cute,

2545
02:17:45.970 --> 02:17:48.040
including hijacking a fucking commy club.

2546
02:17:48.220 --> 02:17:51.730
You're not capable of handling a comedy club.
You shouldn't be there.

2547
02:17:51.790 --> 02:17:53.950
Just like if your ears hurt when things are loud,

2548
02:17:54.040 --> 02:17:57.730
you shouldn't go to a fucking rock club.
If you,
you're scared of violence.

2549
02:17:57.760 --> 02:18:01.030
You shouldn't sit front row at a UFC fight.
It's all the same.

2550
02:18:01.031 --> 02:18:04.210
It's not like we should nerf the world to make it safe for everybody.

2551
02:18:04.300 --> 02:18:07.750
If you don't enjoy someone talking about controversial Shit,

2552
02:18:07.900 --> 02:18:11.680
you certainly shouldn't go to an adult nightclub that's doing standup comedy.

2553
02:18:11.800 --> 02:18:15.610
Or a guy like Daniel fucking tosh who has one of the most edgy shows on TV

2554
02:18:15.611 --> 02:18:19.750
period is doing a standup and he makes a joke because you hackle and that joke

2555
02:18:19.751 --> 02:18:21.890
happens you about what you heckled a bout.

2556
02:18:22.180 --> 02:18:25.690
You can't feel like you're a victim because you're not a victim.

2557
02:18:25.780 --> 02:18:28.990
You're a dummy who doesn't belong in a comedy club,
right?
Well,
again,

2558
02:18:29.020 --> 02:18:34.020
I am not defending the hailing Rosie to my ears hurt.

2559
02:18:34.090 --> 02:18:36.520
You're stupid.
If your ears are sensitive,

2560
02:18:36.521 --> 02:18:39.700
you don't stand next to the fucking speaker.
If you don't like watching,

2561
02:18:39.701 --> 02:18:41.440
dudes gets their ass kicked.
Don't,

2562
02:18:41.441 --> 02:18:45.040
don't go to a UFC fight if you don't like black people.
Don't watch basketball.

2563
02:18:45.130 --> 02:18:48.250
It's really simple.
It's really simple.

2564
02:18:48.310 --> 02:18:50.170
And when you introduce yourself,

2565
02:18:50.440 --> 02:18:54.340
if you introduce yourself into the equation like that woman did,

2566
02:18:54.460 --> 02:18:57.760
you got to take the hit,
but there's going to take the hit.
But again,

2567
02:18:57.761 --> 02:19:00.520
like you thought it was,
you know,

2568
02:19:00.521 --> 02:19:03.070
and we were talking about how good it is when people stand up and protest.

2569
02:19:03.071 --> 02:19:06.640
He's fucking politicians is that you disagree with this?
So of course,
and again,

2570
02:19:06.700 --> 02:19:09.940
I disagree with that.
Agree with standup comedy.

2571
02:19:09.941 --> 02:19:13.390
Show that he wouldn't someone dictating policy or changing the way people live

2572
02:19:13.391 --> 02:19:14.050
their lives.

2573
02:19:14.050 --> 02:19:17.030
It's someone who's cracking jokes on stage trying to make people laugh again,

2574
02:19:17.160 --> 02:19:20.480
someone who interrupts that process because they're done.

2575
02:19:20.500 --> 02:19:23.980
I hate that you're agreeing racy for supporting your fucked up.

2576
02:19:24.070 --> 02:19:25.930
You should have wrote something a lot more detailed.

2577
02:19:25.931 --> 02:19:28.220
Then you should explain yourself and 40

2578
02:19:28.220 --> 02:19:29.810
<v 1>characters.
We should do it on Twitter.</v>

2579
02:19:29.811 --> 02:19:33.380
You should link to a blog because this is something that can cover people.

2580
02:19:33.450 --> 02:19:36.620
Short attention span.
No,
I get mad at people who write dumb blogs.

2581
02:19:36.621 --> 02:19:41.450
I love well-written on his blog.
When I get mad at dumpy,
my heckle,

2582
02:19:41.460 --> 02:19:43.140
I fucking write about blog about high.

2583
02:19:43.150 --> 02:19:46.430
They're shocked that someone could joke around about that.
By the way,

2584
02:19:46.431 --> 02:19:50.160
I heard the joke killed.
I heard most of the audience laughed really hard.

2585
02:19:50.190 --> 02:19:54.100
I thought it was hilarious because you know why it was.
That's because,

2586
02:19:54.160 --> 02:19:56.580
because it was Joe Tex.
Check this out there.

2587
02:19:56.581 --> 02:20:00.650
Somebody told me to play this joy reed.
All right.
What is it?

2588
02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:07.780
<v 7>Well,
I would say backing up completely,
I would,</v>

2589
02:20:07.870 --> 02:20:09.910
I would like to argue the point that that wasn't even a joke.

2590
02:20:10.300 --> 02:20:13.480
He was making a statement.
Oh,
so you're the comedy club,

2591
02:20:13.490 --> 02:20:18.070
you're making a statement.
Um,
it's fair game for an audience member at ago.

2592
02:20:18.700 --> 02:20:21.900
I disagree with your statement because there's been various reports.

2593
02:20:22.190 --> 02:20:23.710
I'll look what happened and what happened.

2594
02:20:23.711 --> 02:20:27.430
And there's the [inaudible] statement and I find this very interesting,

2595
02:20:27.640 --> 02:20:32.410
especially when talking about it from a comics lens and he said that Daniel Tosh

2596
02:20:32.460 --> 02:20:33.670
on stage and said,

2597
02:20:34.030 --> 02:20:37.930
what would you guys like to talk about now that opens up a conversation with

2598
02:20:37.931 --> 02:20:41.830
your audience and somebody yelled rape and I don't know if it was this woman or

2599
02:20:41.831 --> 02:20:46.450
someone else said,
no,
rape jokes are never funny.
And then all of a sudden,

2600
02:20:46.451 --> 02:20:49.060
boom,
if that happened,
then yeah,

2601
02:20:49.090 --> 02:20:51.580
you ask the audience what they thought and people said some.
Yeah.

2602
02:20:51.830 --> 02:20:55.880
<v 1>Okay.
Pause that.
Pause right there.
Because first of all,
she's not,</v>

2603
02:20:56.210 --> 02:21:00.740
she's not telling the truth because she's omitting a very important part of why

2604
02:21:00.741 --> 02:21:04.730
he said that to her.
And she's doing that to make our point make more sense.

2605
02:21:05.060 --> 02:21:09.440
She omitted the fact that he was saying,
Oh yeah,
rape is real funny.

2606
02:21:09.441 --> 02:21:12.290
Like what's funny about rate?
Is it the humiliation that was the,

2607
02:21:12.291 --> 02:21:15.940
is it the violence?
It's stop.
Hold on.
Is this story's Winstead?
No,
no,
no.

2608
02:21:15.990 --> 02:21:19.850
Well then don't talk then.
Don't talk about it if you don't know the full story.

2609
02:21:20.210 --> 02:21:25.210
So Lizz Winstead interjected in or rather edited through the actual reality of

2610
02:21:25.701 --> 02:21:30.110
the conversation and cut out the part where he was detailing what is not funny

2611
02:21:30.111 --> 02:21:33.830
about rape,
to make it seem like what he did was more insensitive.

2612
02:21:34.100 --> 02:21:38.300
If she said,
I guarantee you if someone said rape,
and then,
you know,

2613
02:21:38.301 --> 02:21:43.010
he said,
uh,
you know,
a woman it actually rape was never funny.
And he said,
well,

2614
02:21:43.011 --> 02:21:46.370
wouldn't it be funny if five guys raped right now?
Guess what?
That's still funny.

2615
02:21:46.400 --> 02:21:49.190
You know why?
Because he's not being serious.
Okay.

2616
02:21:49.191 --> 02:21:52.880
If she's self righteously yelling out,
actually rape us.
Never funny.

2617
02:21:53.390 --> 02:21:56.000
It's right for him again to say,

2618
02:21:56.090 --> 02:21:59.900
wouldn't it be funny if she got raped by five people?
Okay,
he's joking.

2619
02:21:59.990 --> 02:22:01.880
He's not being fucking serious.

2620
02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:05.060
Just like when you see a guy in a movie and he's shooting at aliens,

2621
02:22:05.120 --> 02:22:08.750
he's not really in an alien war.
Okay.
It's fucking entertainment.

2622
02:22:08.930 --> 02:22:13.930
And which she did by omitting that very particular part is make it more heinous.

2623
02:22:14.750 --> 02:22:19.750
And yet I still agree with him and I disagree with her and her saying that it's

2624
02:22:19.941 --> 02:22:22.160
not a joke is ridiculous.

2625
02:22:22.190 --> 02:22:26.250
And I have a Lizz Winstead story from when I was an open that I'd like to share

2626
02:22:26.251 --> 02:22:28.680
with you.
This is where it gets really interesting.

2627
02:22:29.010 --> 02:22:32.250
When I was an open miker and I was not that good,
a comedian,

2628
02:22:32.310 --> 02:22:36.150
I was fucking two or three times on stage and Lizz Winstead already had been on

2629
02:22:36.151 --> 02:22:36.984
HBO.

2630
02:22:37.110 --> 02:22:40.620
She there and she was hosting an open mic night and I'm not trying to hold her

2631
02:22:40.621 --> 02:22:43.590
to the fire for this.
Okay.
But this is something that happened.

2632
02:22:43.591 --> 02:22:46.980
It happened more than 20 years ago.
She's on stage.
She had a friend,

2633
02:22:46.981 --> 02:22:49.800
Janine to Tulio was a very funny comic from Boston and they're all palling

2634
02:22:49.801 --> 02:22:53.010
around backstage or this whole girls club.
And um,

2635
02:22:53.070 --> 02:22:56.500
they were there having a great time.
And she said she got on stage and she,

2636
02:22:56.570 --> 02:22:59.540
she said,
I'm hosting open Mike night and when I'm here hosting,

2637
02:22:59.580 --> 02:23:04.140
hosting open Mike Night,
I've got rules,
here's the rules.
Okay,

2638
02:23:04.590 --> 02:23:08.310
no jokes about this.
No jokes about that.

2639
02:23:08.430 --> 02:23:11.520
No jokes about tits.
No,
no sexism.

2640
02:23:11.521 --> 02:23:15.180
She says no sexism.
She says no gay jokes.

2641
02:23:15.181 --> 02:23:20.181
She has a list she's reading and she decides that she's going to interrupt the

2642
02:23:20.881 --> 02:23:25.350
standup comedians while they're on stage and stop them from performing their

2643
02:23:25.351 --> 02:23:29.460
jokes and interrupt them because she decides that a joke is racist.

2644
02:23:29.550 --> 02:23:32.680
She decided a joke,
a sexist.
So there's a door next to this stage.

2645
02:23:32.681 --> 02:23:36.780
So the comedians are onstage and she's getting on stage and interrupting

2646
02:23:36.810 --> 02:23:41.040
individual performance.
Stop,
stop,
stop that sexist.

2647
02:23:41.700 --> 02:23:46.440
So he,
this guy,
Brian,

2648
02:23:46.441 --> 02:23:49.440
I forget his fucking name,
he was a very funny guy,

2649
02:23:49.680 --> 02:23:54.680
but he was particularly shy and he was an open mic or a career open miker he was

2650
02:23:55.531 --> 02:23:58.950
a guy that had been doing,
are you into what a bitch,
any attention.

2651
02:23:59.760 --> 02:24:04.760
He was a guy who would struggle to keep it together on stage every time.

2652
02:24:05.730 --> 02:24:10.020
And he was a very gifted comic writer.
But he very uncomfortable performer.

2653
02:24:10.140 --> 02:24:11.520
He had a really hard time performing.

2654
02:24:11.820 --> 02:24:16.740
So he goes on stage and he has this joke where he says,
um,

2655
02:24:17.100 --> 02:24:18.750
something about,
um,

2656
02:24:18.840 --> 02:24:23.840
I always make sure I open up the car door for my hooker and Liz Winstead

2657
02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:31.260
interrupts,
stop,
stop,
stop sexism.

2658
02:24:31.440 --> 02:24:35.370
And he says,
and don't think he doesn't appreciate it,

2659
02:24:35.460 --> 02:24:39.870
which is his punchline.
Okay.
So she's standing on stage right after he says that,

2660
02:24:39.871 --> 02:24:42.540
and she stopped him and he's so awkward.

2661
02:24:42.541 --> 02:24:47.400
He's got his eyes close during his,
his fucking thing.
I mean,

2662
02:24:47.401 --> 02:24:52.320
it's,
it's just,
it's so fucking annoying one that's driving me crazy.

2663
02:24:52.410 --> 02:24:54.480
So I get on stage,
okay.

2664
02:24:54.630 --> 02:24:59.490
And I'm in the middle of something and she comes out and says,
sexism,
stop,
stop.

2665
02:24:59.790 --> 02:25:03.030
And I said,
Liz,
don't you get enough fucking attention?
I go,

2666
02:25:03.031 --> 02:25:06.120
you go on stage every night you have this HBO special,

2667
02:25:06.121 --> 02:25:07.590
you're a national headliner.

2668
02:25:07.770 --> 02:25:12.540
And yet you can't let us an open miker have five minutes to try to say whatever

2669
02:25:12.541 --> 02:25:15.000
the fuck they want to say.
You have to come on and interrupt.

2670
02:25:15.180 --> 02:25:20.160
And so she says to me,
you know,
I know the people who own this club,

2671
02:25:20.340 --> 02:25:24.010
I'll just let you know right now.
This is not right.
This is 100% real.
And I said,

2672
02:25:24.010 --> 02:25:26.440
<v 5>that's it really.
I called,
that's what you're telling me.</v>

2673
02:25:26.441 --> 02:25:28.240
You're a professional fucking comedian.

2674
02:25:28.360 --> 02:25:31.960
And I have a very good point about you needing attention to interrupting sets.

2675
02:25:32.050 --> 02:25:35.380
And you tell me that you know the people who booked this club insinuating that

2676
02:25:35.381 --> 02:25:39.490
you can stop me from working here.
I go,
fucking really?
I go,
I'm done.

2677
02:25:39.580 --> 02:25:40.960
And so I walked off the stage,

2678
02:25:40.990 --> 02:25:44.650
I put the microphone down and I walked off the stage and I'll never forget that.

2679
02:25:44.680 --> 02:25:48.260
And so listening to that,
Laney,
just understand and,

2680
02:25:48.261 --> 02:25:51.790
and judge that because that's a true thing that happened to eight.
Oh,

2681
02:25:51.791 --> 02:25:52.510
of course it does.

2682
02:25:52.510 --> 02:25:56.860
But that's a true thing that happened to a open mic comic by a professional

2683
02:25:56.861 --> 02:25:58.090
headline or comedian.
Sure.

2684
02:25:58.091 --> 02:26:02.140
And this is the point where it's sexism can bounce the other way and it becomes

2685
02:26:02.170 --> 02:26:06.520
nonsense.
It becomes you and forcing your ideology on other people and you,

2686
02:26:06.521 --> 02:26:08.710
it's not about being fair.
And right and running,

2687
02:26:08.730 --> 02:26:13.060
adjust happy society where people around allowed creative differences.
No,

2688
02:26:13.090 --> 02:26:16.900
it's about you and forcing your own ego and bullshit on other people.
Yeah,

2689
02:26:16.901 --> 02:26:18.340
I didn't mean it was one of those things where like

2690
02:26:19.880 --> 02:26:21.580
let's listen to the rest of what she has to say.

2691
02:26:23.250 --> 02:26:26.060
<v 7>A woman's report and then the club owner issued a statement and I find this very</v>

2692
02:26:26.061 --> 02:26:26.750
interesting,

2693
02:26:26.750 --> 02:26:31.570
especially when talking about it from a comics lens and he said that Dale task

2694
02:26:31.580 --> 02:26:32.780
on stage and said,

2695
02:26:33.110 --> 02:26:37.010
what would you guys like to talk about now that opens up a conversation with

2696
02:26:37.011 --> 02:26:39.080
your audience.
We already said something so it's not,

2697
02:26:39.390 --> 02:26:40.850
it's not quite in the same thing as being heckled,

2698
02:26:41.450 --> 02:26:43.580
being heckled for a joke you told.
Yeah,
there was a joke.

2699
02:26:43.970 --> 02:26:47.450
It wasn't even like the equivalent of if there was one tiny room and he had
said,

2700
02:26:47.451 --> 02:26:47.601
you know,

2701
02:26:47.601 --> 02:26:52.160
wouldn't it be funny if everybody just lynched that guy right now because a joke

2702
02:26:52.161 --> 02:26:55.550
as it is an attack on that person because he was obviously angry with it.

2703
02:26:55.551 --> 02:26:56.384
Hold on,

2704
02:26:57.240 --> 02:27:00.580
<v 5>you got stupid.
That is because that's ridiculous because it's not,</v>

2705
02:27:00.581 --> 02:27:04.710
when she was the only woman in a room full of men.
That's so dumb.
We don't fuck.

2706
02:27:04.830 --> 02:27:07.500
People are so stupid with their analogies.
What?

2707
02:27:07.501 --> 02:27:10.890
That would be the same as was there was one black guy and everybody's like,

2708
02:27:10.891 --> 02:27:15.870
let's go get them hold up.
Fuck.
Is that the same?
How the fuck is that the same?

2709
02:27:16.140 --> 02:27:21.140
Why is everybody so God damn crazy and why does so many people want to cry

2710
02:27:21.541 --> 02:27:25.050
victim when they're just stew bed?

2711
02:27:25.380 --> 02:27:29.160
This is not a victim issue.
This is us stupid person issue.

2712
02:27:29.190 --> 02:27:33.390
I mean I think it comes down to she does agree with him.

2713
02:27:33.450 --> 02:27:37.850
We disagree on how she handled it.
I disagree with you.

2714
02:27:37.851 --> 02:27:40.620
You disagree with me,
but it's like what do you disagree with me?
Oh,

2715
02:27:40.621 --> 02:27:42.300
just about the whole rape thing.

2716
02:27:42.320 --> 02:27:43.750
The thing you've been yelling at me about for what?

2717
02:27:43.930 --> 02:27:46.800
I disagree with what you you mean you've never disagreed?
Well,

2718
02:27:46.801 --> 02:27:49.670
the fact that I'm not honestly never have because I've,

2719
02:27:49.671 --> 02:27:53.160
I've told you that I don't think that he contributes to raping people.

2720
02:27:53.250 --> 02:27:54.480
And you're saying that you didn't say that?

2721
02:27:54.600 --> 02:27:56.580
I do not think he contributors to raping people.

2722
02:27:56.581 --> 02:27:59.670
You're saying that contributes to rape culture and I'm saying what the fuck is

2723
02:27:59.671 --> 02:28:01.560
that then?
Well,
and that's what I was telling you.

2724
02:28:01.561 --> 02:28:06.561
It's the fact that we live in a culture where women who have been raped aren't

2725
02:28:06.571 --> 02:28:08.520
allowed to.
The way we're saying it,

2726
02:28:08.521 --> 02:28:10.560
go to comedy clubs because they might get offended.

2727
02:28:10.561 --> 02:28:14.430
And I'm saying that I think that that sort of sucks for them considering they

2728
02:28:14.431 --> 02:28:17.520
were fucking money man.
And then now they have to watch where they go.

2729
02:28:17.540 --> 02:28:18.780
That's when like that was,

2730
02:28:18.880 --> 02:28:21.710
you're going to have to take away every single thing that people have been

2731
02:28:21.711 --> 02:28:24.380
victimized from it and take it out of the vocabulary,

2732
02:28:24.381 --> 02:28:25.520
the vernacular of comedy then,

2733
02:28:25.700 --> 02:28:28.970
because then everything like I've been beat up before.
If you've been beat up,

2734
02:28:29.160 --> 02:28:32.060
you have a gun that's way worse than getting it right.

2735
02:28:32.150 --> 02:28:36.260
John Brian's been robbed a gun and he was fucking freaking out every time he was

2736
02:28:36.261 --> 02:28:39.200
in a parking lot for months afterwards.
And I know that's true,
but you know what?

2737
02:28:39.201 --> 02:28:42.590
He still go to a comedy club and know about the time where he almost lost his

2738
02:28:42.591 --> 02:28:45.680
life with a gun in his fucking face.
And if someone jokes about robbery,

2739
02:28:45.830 --> 02:28:49.250
he should be able to laugh at that.
I would take rape af over getting,

2740
02:28:49.251 --> 02:28:52.460
getting that happened to me again unless someone,
wow.
Wow.
I would,

2741
02:28:52.490 --> 02:28:56.540
I would get raped before getting robbed by gun again.
Which really?
You say that,

2742
02:28:56.541 --> 02:28:59.180
but I don't think there's nothing.
I see what your point is.

2743
02:28:59.181 --> 02:29:01.430
I see your point is like someone just wants to have sex and I'm going to kill

2744
02:29:01.431 --> 02:29:03.230
you.
Right?
Yeah,
you're right.
You're right.
You're right.

2745
02:29:03.231 --> 02:29:06.440
We're murders worse than rape.
Yeah,
you're right.
Absolutely.
If your loved ones,

2746
02:29:06.441 --> 02:29:09.200
you know got raped,
you'd feel horrible.
If they've got murdered,
your feel worse.

2747
02:29:09.950 --> 02:29:14.510
But I don't know.
Either way you get murdered,
your owl,
come on,
it's terrible.

2748
02:29:14.511 --> 02:29:17.420
But you still can have loved ones and still have good experiences and yeah,

2749
02:29:17.421 --> 02:29:20.790
you're going to have bad memories.
But like I said,
it's not about us and like,
oh,

2750
02:29:20.870 --> 02:29:23.570
you know,
our wife was murdered or art wipe was raped.

2751
02:29:23.571 --> 02:29:26.570
It's about like the victim of the crime.
And like with rape,

2752
02:29:26.600 --> 02:29:28.670
you have to live with that shit forever.
I mean,

2753
02:29:28.671 --> 02:29:33.671
that is such a violent fucking act that people use that you saying that rape is

2754
02:29:33.801 --> 02:29:34.491
worse than murder.

2755
02:29:34.491 --> 02:29:39.230
It's so fucking crazy because rape is horrible for the person that gets raped.

2756
02:29:39.380 --> 02:29:42.680
Murder is horrible for the person who dies and everyone loves them too,

2757
02:29:42.681 --> 02:29:45.890
who will never see them again because they don't exist because someone stopped

2758
02:29:45.891 --> 02:29:49.160
their fucking life.
That's worse.
They're both terrible.

2759
02:29:49.250 --> 02:29:52.250
But to say that one rape is worse because you remember it,

2760
02:29:52.251 --> 02:29:55.640
it's crazy because there's therapy.
People get on ecstasy.

2761
02:29:55.641 --> 02:29:57.480
They do Mtma and have these uh,

2762
02:29:57.510 --> 02:30:00.710
posttraumatic stress disorder clinics where they work with people with

2763
02:30:00.711 --> 02:30:04.250
psychedelic drugs and help them recover from things by having spiritual

2764
02:30:04.251 --> 02:30:08.300
experiences that you can recover from rape.
It's a terrible,
terrible thing.

2765
02:30:08.450 --> 02:30:11.060
I am not condoning it or endorsing it in any way,
shape or form.

2766
02:30:11.540 --> 02:30:14.990
I think murders words.
Brian almost got murdered and my girlfriend,

2767
02:30:15.010 --> 02:30:19.610
16 year old who was raped,
has access to psychedelic dry.

2768
02:30:19.700 --> 02:30:23.540
You're right.
Look,
I'm not saying that rape is good.
It's terrible.

2769
02:30:23.541 --> 02:30:26.330
That's a terrible thing,
but murderous.
Worst man.

2770
02:30:26.450 --> 02:30:28.460
And you could joke about murder all day.

2771
02:30:28.461 --> 02:30:31.790
You could joke about murdering people all day and no one in the audience who's

2772
02:30:31.791 --> 02:30:34.040
lost a friend to murder should be allowed to step in and go,

2773
02:30:34.041 --> 02:30:38.330
I've lost a friend of murderer.
Stop it with your murder jokes,
right?
Yeah,

2774
02:30:38.331 --> 02:30:39.980
but I don't know if you would like,
again,

2775
02:30:39.981 --> 02:30:43.190
like lash out and attack that person as much.
Like if that person was fucking,

2776
02:30:43.191 --> 02:30:46.190
you would,
if they heckled,
you would.
If you were telling a joke about murder,

2777
02:30:46.191 --> 02:30:49.460
someone said,
talk about murder and you go north.
It's funny about murder.

2778
02:30:49.760 --> 02:30:53.720
You know what's funny about murder?
The bullet killing someone though an Arrow,

2779
02:30:53.721 --> 02:30:57.070
a machete,
and some of those actually murders never funny and you go,

2780
02:30:57.320 --> 02:30:59.960
wouldn't it be funny if somebody just murdered him?
But again,
man,

2781
02:30:59.961 --> 02:31:02.330
where would you stand on this and not,
this is what you stand on.
This jury.

2782
02:31:02.370 --> 02:31:05.000
Would you stand in that if somebody wrote a blog and the blog was written by a

2783
02:31:05.001 --> 02:31:07.700
fat man,
I served dumb man that you don't want,

2784
02:31:07.710 --> 02:31:10.040
you don't want is love and he believes in the confederate flag.

2785
02:31:10.190 --> 02:31:12.530
And what if he wrote a blog about that?
Would you stand up for him?

2786
02:31:12.531 --> 02:31:15.320
Cause it's the same fucking issue.
It is the same issue.

2787
02:31:15.500 --> 02:31:18.290
It's certainly it because murder is getting fucking reported.

2788
02:31:18.291 --> 02:31:21.570
There's not a stigma,
uh,
about murder.

2789
02:31:21.571 --> 02:31:26.250
The murder or the person that the family of the family of the person who was

2790
02:31:26.251 --> 02:31:28.980
murdered doesn't have to defend the fucking victim.

2791
02:31:28.981 --> 02:31:31.920
The victim isn't fucking put on trial sometimes they're obviously they listen

2792
02:31:31.980 --> 02:31:34.260
man,
the euro,
you are creating a lot of strong in here.

2793
02:31:34.261 --> 02:31:36.630
This is not w murder is worse.

2794
02:31:36.720 --> 02:31:41.020
And you're saying that [inaudible] happened and it was a murder joke that that

2795
02:31:41.021 --> 02:31:43.960
would be okay.
That's what you're saying is that I say that's crazy.

2796
02:31:43.961 --> 02:31:45.290
Here's what I'm saying cause I think we were talking to

2797
02:31:45.440 --> 02:31:48.740
<v 4>no because we're talking about comedy man.
We're not talking about reality.</v>

2798
02:31:48.741 --> 02:31:51.080
That's my point.
I know that if someone says,

2799
02:31:51.230 --> 02:31:52.850
would it be funny if somebody just murdered him?

2800
02:31:52.970 --> 02:31:54.560
You know that that's worse than saying,

2801
02:31:54.561 --> 02:31:57.470
would it be funny if someone just raped him?
That's not worse.
It is worse.

2802
02:31:57.740 --> 02:32:02.540
Murders.
Murders were way worse than murder is worse than rape.
Man,
I don't,

2803
02:32:02.541 --> 02:32:06.170
I don't think we have this conversation.
You'd rather be murdered and raped.

2804
02:32:06.440 --> 02:32:09.560
What's that?
You would rather be murdered and raped,
then raped.
Yes.

2805
02:32:09.590 --> 02:32:12.230
You would rather be murdered and raped.
I would rather,

2806
02:32:12.260 --> 02:32:14.630
if someone is going to have to live with rape or rape,

2807
02:32:15.230 --> 02:32:16.970
none of us will have to understand saying murders,

2808
02:32:17.640 --> 02:32:20.160
none of us understand what these fucking girls are going.
Well,
you're not,

2809
02:32:20.320 --> 02:32:23.500
I'm not talking about that man.
I'm talking about his murder worsen.

2810
02:32:23.510 --> 02:32:27.020
Raped by say it is for me.
Yes.
Yeah,
of course.
I would rather get,

2811
02:32:27.050 --> 02:32:29.510
I would rather for every other fucking human being that's ever lived,

2812
02:32:29.550 --> 02:32:32.870
murders worse than me.
Don't fucking know what they're going through.
We don't.

2813
02:32:33.050 --> 02:32:35.860
And the fact,
Jamie,
you're talking nonsense.
The key to bringing up the feeling

2814
02:32:38.890 --> 02:32:40.520
of the show was all about how,

2815
02:32:40.670 --> 02:32:42.590
you know we have to have more empathy for each other,

2816
02:32:42.680 --> 02:32:44.990
but were screaming about how fucking rape victims

2817
02:32:46.910 --> 02:32:50.420
and not go to a fucking comedy.
We're comparing murder to rape.

2818
02:32:50.450 --> 02:32:52.180
That's what we're doing.
We're not doing all these other things.

2819
02:32:52.210 --> 02:32:53.480
You're trying to introduce into the,

2820
02:32:54.170 --> 02:32:56.350
<v 5>we're not doing that.
We're comparing motor,
the rape,</v>

2821
02:32:56.570 --> 02:32:59.870
and we're saying that murder,
it's worse than rape.
You kill people.

2822
02:32:59.871 --> 02:33:03.170
They cease to exist.
They die.
If someone has sex with you against your will,

2823
02:33:03.171 --> 02:33:05.930
it's a horrible,
horrible thing that should hurt you.

2824
02:33:06.080 --> 02:33:09.040
It's going to be a bad thing,
but it's not as bad as murder picked.

2825
02:33:09.050 --> 02:33:11.090
The reason that it's more stigmatized,

2826
02:33:11.091 --> 02:33:14.330
the reason that more people will realize more than murder,
man,

2827
02:33:14.840 --> 02:33:17.720
if you found out that a guy raped someone,
you,
oh,
what an asshole.

2828
02:33:17.721 --> 02:33:21.320
If you find a guy murdered someone,
that's a different fucking feeling.
I see.

2829
02:33:21.321 --> 02:33:23.810
That's right.
He's a great,
I want the guy who murdered people.

2830
02:33:23.930 --> 02:33:27.710
I want the guy who murdered people killed immediately removed from society.

2831
02:33:27.860 --> 02:33:31.310
I want the guy who raped someone.
I want to find out what the fuck went wrong,

2832
02:33:31.370 --> 02:33:35.300
that he de-humanize people to the point where his sexual needs or power needs or

2833
02:33:35.301 --> 02:33:38.690
whatever the fuck did that supersedes his need to come to,

2834
02:33:38.710 --> 02:33:42.830
to compliment his fellow humans toe to be a part of humanity and culture.

2835
02:33:42.830 --> 02:33:43.970
What went wrong with this guy?

2836
02:33:44.120 --> 02:33:46.490
I want to find out if he was raped by his Pamet parents.

2837
02:33:46.580 --> 02:33:49.850
We can learn something about that guy,
but we can't.
We can't with murder.

2838
02:33:49.910 --> 02:33:51.080
I think a lot of times with murder,

2839
02:33:51.081 --> 02:33:54.170
it's just people have access to things and they have impulses and they do

2840
02:33:54.171 --> 02:33:56.210
terrible things.
I mean,
there's a lot of different reasons for murder.

2841
02:33:56.211 --> 02:33:58.070
This is a million different reasons for murder.

2842
02:33:58.390 --> 02:34:00.860
There's only a couple of different reasons for rape.
It's not,

2843
02:34:00.861 --> 02:34:02.300
it's not nearly as complicated.

2844
02:34:02.301 --> 02:34:04.310
There's all sorts of reasons why people want people dead.

2845
02:34:04.460 --> 02:34:07.940
There's not reasons why people want to rate people.
There's only a couple.

2846
02:34:08.060 --> 02:34:10.040
It's either you want some sex,
so you want to control,

2847
02:34:10.041 --> 02:34:11.180
so going to be violent with them.

2848
02:34:11.330 --> 02:34:15.110
It's not like it's fucking bitch looked in my bike.
Funny.
I got a raper.
You know,

2849
02:34:15.111 --> 02:34:18.870
this is it's people kill people.
They were the wrong clothes.
You know,

2850
02:34:18.880 --> 02:34:21.700
you can wear blue and a red neighborhood and they kill you.

2851
02:34:21.800 --> 02:34:25.390
There's a lot more differences.
Why people murder you then rape you.

2852
02:34:25.391 --> 02:34:30.130
So it's an unfair comparison but murders worse,
you know,
and I,
yeah,

2853
02:34:30.131 --> 02:34:33.640
you can't understand what it's like for someone to have been victimized by that

2854
02:34:33.641 --> 02:34:33.971
crime.

2855
02:34:33.971 --> 02:34:37.330
You also can understand when it's worse for a mother to lose her son to violence

2856
02:34:37.331 --> 02:34:39.700
because that could be just as bad or worse.

2857
02:34:39.820 --> 02:34:42.190
And I think like talking to these hypothetical,
it's like,
yeah,

2858
02:34:42.191 --> 02:34:46.090
but that's what you keep doing.
Keep bringing up to hypothetical justifications.

2859
02:34:46.091 --> 02:34:48.310
And I'm saying that you can't do that man.
And I'm saying,

2860
02:34:48.311 --> 02:34:50.560
you know that they're both just jokes that a guide joking around,

2861
02:34:50.561 --> 02:34:53.950
but I wouldn't be funny if that guy got murdered is the same as someone saying,

2862
02:34:53.951 --> 02:34:55.360
wouldn't it be funny if that guy got raped?

2863
02:34:55.600 --> 02:35:00.220
These doesn't really mean that he's making a joke to move a comedy show along.

2864
02:35:00.400 --> 02:35:04.720
So we're all introducing it and Lizz Winstead fucking hypocrite.

2865
02:35:04.721 --> 02:35:08.770
Bullshit to her to say on stage that it's not even a joke.
Of course.

2866
02:35:08.771 --> 02:35:12.820
Had to JOE's out there.
It's a direct job.
There's the joke ready set up.

2867
02:35:13.210 --> 02:35:16.120
Actually rape is never funny.
Punchline.

2868
02:35:16.121 --> 02:35:19.060
Wouldn't it be funny if she just got raped by five guys?
That's,
that's it.

2869
02:35:19.061 --> 02:35:22.330
That's a joke.
She to say that that's not a joke is silly.

2870
02:35:22.750 --> 02:35:26.170
It's not saying we're endorsing rape.
It's not saying people should,

2871
02:35:26.200 --> 02:35:30.580
should be allowed to say horrible things to people.

2872
02:35:30.670 --> 02:35:34.090
It's you're not dealing with the context of the situation where someone was

2873
02:35:34.091 --> 02:35:36.130
reacting to someone's saying something dumb.

2874
02:35:38.090 --> 02:35:42.130
Am I rape that bathroom in a bit?
Are you going to,
Can I pee first?
Sure.

2875
02:35:42.370 --> 02:35:44.680
Do you have to go?
I've got to pay a,
yeah.
Why?

2876
02:35:44.681 --> 02:35:46.940
I was supposed to go like half an hour ago.
Listen man,
I,

2877
02:35:46.941 --> 02:35:50.130
I didn't want to hold you to the coals like this,
but this is a,

2878
02:35:50.140 --> 02:35:54.520
this is a very controversial,
we legit,
we legitimately disagree.

2879
02:35:54.760 --> 02:35:57.310
I don't think you are pro rape.

2880
02:35:57.430 --> 02:36:00.940
I fucking still hope you don't think I'm pro censorship.
Do you want?

2881
02:36:01.120 --> 02:36:02.590
If you think you should have done that,

2882
02:36:03.100 --> 02:36:06.070
then you think that he could not have been fun even though everybody laughed.

2883
02:36:06.910 --> 02:36:11.650
Yeah.
But I mean that's like everybody's sense of humor is fucking subjective.

2884
02:36:11.651 --> 02:36:14.230
Like you don't think everything can be so took for those people.

2885
02:36:14.231 --> 02:36:16.000
That was a great moment.
So why?
So why,

2886
02:36:16.001 --> 02:36:20.380
so why do you think that didn't happen with when cook the next week or two weeks

2887
02:36:20.381 --> 02:36:24.190
later or whatever there were again,
because murder is worse than rape.

2888
02:36:24.910 --> 02:36:28.600
There you go man.
People got like no one really defended that.

2889
02:36:28.600 --> 02:36:30.940
But don't nobody defended cook because it wasn't a good joke.

2890
02:36:30.941 --> 02:36:34.570
But don't you think that it was joking around about the rape and or excuse me

2891
02:36:34.571 --> 02:36:36.940
about murder and it wasn't a good joke so nobody defended them.

2892
02:36:36.941 --> 02:36:39.970
That's why everybody defended tosh cause it cause murders worse than rape.

2893
02:36:40.150 --> 02:36:42.700
You son of a bitch.
I think people got mad at uh,

2894
02:36:42.760 --> 02:36:46.420
I know I got mad at the Ymca because the joke was that the movie was so bad.

2895
02:36:46.450 --> 02:36:48.910
He was thinking that.
What was it?
He want to hurt.
The movie's awesome.

2896
02:36:49.120 --> 02:36:50.140
It's fucking incredible.
That was the,

2897
02:36:50.210 --> 02:36:53.170
I got more mad at that than the murder thing where I was like,
well,

2898
02:36:53.640 --> 02:36:57.310
I know Dane Dane is a type of dude who will say things to try to be funny.

2899
02:36:57.340 --> 02:37:00.010
You know,
he's trying to,
he's trying to be edgy.
He's trying to crack a good joke,

2900
02:37:00.030 --> 02:37:03.490
but look,
man,
this is a crazy thing to do.
Do it a week later.
Should I fuck it?

2901
02:37:03.491 --> 02:37:07.420
Let's do it.
Yeah.
You know,
I mean,
he doesn't mean here's an easier,
uh,
and then I,

2902
02:37:08.800 --> 02:37:10.930
but this went well.
Um,

2903
02:37:11.400 --> 02:37:15.920
I don't again want to be censored.
I don't like calculators,
but

2904
02:37:16.400 --> 02:37:20.390
<v 1>um,
me personally,
I don't like rape.
I don't like white on white violence either.</v>

2905
02:37:20.391 --> 02:37:21.200
I don't like,

2906
02:37:21.200 --> 02:37:25.760
I don't like anything cunty but that also means when someone who was on non

2907
02:37:25.761 --> 02:37:27.200
rapist and nonviolent,

2908
02:37:27.201 --> 02:37:30.560
like Daniel Tosh is at a comedy club and he makes a joke about rape.

2909
02:37:30.561 --> 02:37:33.580
He shouldn't be fucking chastised by these dummies on the air.

2910
02:37:33.920 --> 02:37:38.510
This nonsense that you're hearing between,
from Lizz Winstead it's just so silly.

2911
02:37:38.690 --> 02:37:41.900
It's silly.
You shouldn't rate people apps a fucking lutely.

2912
02:37:41.901 --> 02:37:45.740
You also should shut your fucking mouth at a comedy club.
Don't want,

2913
02:37:45.970 --> 02:37:49.670
if you don't want to get blowback,
can we agree that we're all anti rape?

2914
02:37:49.850 --> 02:37:54.710
We're all anti rape,
but I do,
I guess I paid money for it,
but I do a,

2915
02:37:54.711 --> 02:37:58.410
you know,
I do go back to what you said before where it's just like,
I dunno,

2916
02:37:58.460 --> 02:38:03.380
as tedious as it may be or whatever.
I would much rather,
I just,

2917
02:38:03.381 --> 02:38:06.680
I dunno.
I think like me personally,

2918
02:38:06.681 --> 02:38:08.990
like when I write like I do think about it,
I'm like,

2919
02:38:08.991 --> 02:38:11.210
am I going after the right person?
Do you know what I mean?

2920
02:38:11.211 --> 02:38:13.310
And that was an ad Lib thing.
Like I'm taking it out of the tosh.

2921
02:38:13.910 --> 02:38:17.240
It's really simple,
man.
When you could have really said was great.
I mean,

2922
02:38:17.241 --> 02:38:20.780
this is what I said when I would say,
you should think what I think,
but what I,

2923
02:38:20.810 --> 02:38:24.620
my,
my point of view was that,
yeah,
you brave isn't funny.

2924
02:38:24.710 --> 02:38:28.700
But that was funny because he didn't rape anybody.
It's not a rape,
it's a word.

2925
02:38:28.730 --> 02:38:32.270
Words came out of his mouth.
It's describing a ridiculous fictional scenario.

2926
02:38:32.570 --> 02:38:34.310
I mean,
would it be worse if he said,

2927
02:38:34.430 --> 02:38:37.990
wouldn't it be funny if gargoyles came down and ate her asshole and,

2928
02:38:38.080 --> 02:38:40.270
and killed her again?
I'm,
yeah,
that would be worth,

2929
02:38:40.410 --> 02:38:43.370
it would be worse than this gargoyle jokes.
You're not giving yourself credit.

2930
02:38:43.371 --> 02:38:45.410
They're very funny.
Dolphin Piss,

2931
02:38:45.411 --> 02:38:49.880
drowning by dolphin pitches where the worst ways to go that is Unicorn is even

2932
02:38:49.881 --> 02:38:51.530
worse.
That's worse than rape for Unicorn.

2933
02:38:51.570 --> 02:38:56.030
But look what I'm saying is that this is comedy and it's not real.

2934
02:38:56.090 --> 02:38:59.840
And that's what a guy's doing when he's doing what Taj did is asking the

2935
02:38:59.841 --> 02:39:02.750
audience what I'm used to coming up with new material and he's fucking around.

2936
02:39:02.800 --> 02:39:04.640
But what I'm saying is like,
we all have comics,

2937
02:39:04.641 --> 02:39:07.820
we don't like me and you agree on it felt like tosh sheriff was funny.

2938
02:39:07.821 --> 02:39:11.600
I actually don't know much of it.
He's a good dude.
He's a good,
he's a good dude.

2939
02:39:11.601 --> 02:39:14.700
He's always friendly when every time I met him he's been real friendly to me of,

2940
02:39:14.750 --> 02:39:16.550
I only talked to Tosh a few times.

2941
02:39:16.550 --> 02:39:19.150
I did a show once Haber and have you did a thing with um,

2942
02:39:19.430 --> 02:39:22.220
we did a thing with Manny Pacquiao.
He was also a great guy.

2943
02:39:22.221 --> 02:39:24.830
Manny Pacquiao was like one of the nicest guys of all time.
You meet him,

2944
02:39:24.831 --> 02:39:26.870
you would never believe he's a stone cold killer.

2945
02:39:27.020 --> 02:39:30.860
He's so friendly and generous and nice to people.
Very small.
God.
Yeah.

2946
02:39:31.160 --> 02:39:34.650
And Daniel talks is very tall too,
but Tinder was house is a really nice guy man.

2947
02:39:34.651 --> 02:39:35.810
And he's not a hurtful person.

2948
02:39:35.811 --> 02:39:38.780
He's just trying to make some people laugh and do his gig and he does it really

2949
02:39:38.781 --> 02:39:39.650
well and you know,

2950
02:39:39.651 --> 02:39:43.430
and this and hear this from like these silly people like Lizz Winstead saying,

2951
02:39:43.431 --> 02:39:44.630
first of all it wasn't a joke.

2952
02:39:44.840 --> 02:39:48.740
I'm glad I told that story about open mic days cause I never told that story

2953
02:39:48.741 --> 02:39:51.050
before and maybe she doesn't remember it and maybe she'll tell you.

2954
02:39:51.050 --> 02:39:54.640
Say it's not true.
It's fucking true.
I remember that shit to the end.

2955
02:39:54.650 --> 02:39:56.750
Cause I remember I had this girlfriend I was dating at the time.

2956
02:39:56.751 --> 02:39:58.160
Her name was Stephanie.
She was older than me.

2957
02:39:58.190 --> 02:40:00.290
One of the first times ever dated a chick.
He's telling me what to do,

2958
02:40:00.950 --> 02:40:04.880
but she locked the fuck.
So it was fun.
She was cool.
She was a nice,
nice person,

2959
02:40:04.881 --> 02:40:07.940
but she was older than me and you just like tell me what to do.

2960
02:40:07.941 --> 02:40:11.210
And then after I got off stage,
I walked off the stage and uh,
she said,

2961
02:40:11.211 --> 02:40:13.010
you can't do that.
She said,
if you want to be a comedian,

2962
02:40:13.020 --> 02:40:14.340
you have to be a community.
Can't just quit.

2963
02:40:14.341 --> 02:40:17.070
In the middle of doing comedy was like,
Damn Bitch,
you feisty.

2964
02:40:17.450 --> 02:40:20.280
She was telling me what to do,
our thoughts and I'll never forget that man,

2965
02:40:20.281 --> 02:40:22.770
because I remember thinking,
I don't want to deal with this kind of people.

2966
02:40:23.100 --> 02:40:26.310
I mean,
it's nonsense.
If someone would actually fucking do that.

2967
02:40:26.340 --> 02:40:28.080
I don't want to Ryan coin,
that was the guy's name.

2968
02:40:28.110 --> 02:40:30.260
I don't want to do with censorship either.
And it's like,
I mean,
the thing is,

2969
02:40:30.261 --> 02:40:33.070
is like,
but that isn't the issue of debate it before and it's not okay,

2970
02:40:33.150 --> 02:40:37.140
not it's you,
you telling me that I shouldn't have said something like that.
No.

2971
02:40:37.141 --> 02:40:39.090
I'm saying I really should have said something like,
man,

2972
02:40:39.770 --> 02:40:44.430
well that was by saying contributes to rape culture though.

2973
02:40:44.431 --> 02:40:46.890
You are saying it should be censored.
I found that shitty.

2974
02:40:46.950 --> 02:40:50.520
Just like you found my opinion.
Shitty.
I didn't find your opinion shitty.

2975
02:40:50.550 --> 02:40:55.550
I found your opinion a little self involved and I felt like there's a certain

2976
02:40:56.341 --> 02:41:00.660
thing that some people do when they get on Twitter where they say things because

2977
02:41:00.661 --> 02:41:03.600
they know that they're going to get a bunch of people agreeing with them and

2978
02:41:03.601 --> 02:41:06.570
then not necessarily making.
Certainly because that fucking worked out for me.

2979
02:41:06.870 --> 02:41:10.100
That was my goal.
Lefties,
your your people for sure.

2980
02:41:10.130 --> 02:41:14.880
Now that you write on a daily basis,
I see.
I do write things.
Fellow liberals,

2981
02:41:14.881 --> 02:41:16.920
you write things on Twitter,
fellow liberals.

2982
02:41:16.921 --> 02:41:18.360
I know who you're communicating with,

2983
02:41:18.510 --> 02:41:20.340
your communicating with people who already love you.

2984
02:41:21.330 --> 02:41:23.910
That's a year where you're saying things that you want,

2985
02:41:23.911 --> 02:41:26.970
people who already love you and you know how they feel about things like that.

2986
02:41:27.090 --> 02:41:29.400
When you start saying shit like it's supporting rape culture.

2987
02:41:29.420 --> 02:41:31.440
You know who you're talking.
I'm shitty at business,

2988
02:41:31.470 --> 02:41:34.620
but if you thought that I thought this was gonna work out,

2989
02:41:34.710 --> 02:41:37.590
this was going to be a lot of fucking fun to deal with on shows podcast.

2990
02:41:37.710 --> 02:41:41.200
Like I know who follows me on Twitter,
but I know he was more vocal.
I,

2991
02:41:41.360 --> 02:41:45.780
I knew that I was going to get shit for this.
I wasn't like ecstatic about it,

2992
02:41:45.781 --> 02:41:48.390
but that doesn't mean that the only reason I'm not going to defense something

2993
02:41:48.391 --> 02:41:51.450
that I believe in his cause I don't want to piss off my friends like not what

2994
02:41:51.480 --> 02:41:52.650
I'm saying.
I didn't say that at all.

2995
02:41:52.651 --> 02:41:57.210
What I said was it seemed like you were preaching to the choir in a way that you

2996
02:41:57.211 --> 02:42:00.460
thought they wanted you to hear.
I never thought it was that.
No Dude.

2997
02:42:00.461 --> 02:42:03.090
So many thousands of people just knew we were ready for a fight and you said

2998
02:42:03.091 --> 02:42:04.530
like,
I have to stand my ground.

2999
02:42:04.960 --> 02:42:08.580
I fucking felt just like everybody will tweet their fucking opinions on how they

3000
02:42:08.581 --> 02:42:11.910
feel.
Just like you'll tweet your opinions on the wan drugs,
on the military,

3001
02:42:11.911 --> 02:42:14.640
industrial complex,
whatever.
It's you tweeting your opinions.

3002
02:42:14.641 --> 02:42:18.660
That was me tweeting my opinions that this opinion do you disagreed with?
Yeah,

3003
02:42:18.740 --> 02:42:22.680
so shit like it's just an opinion.
So stance,

3004
02:42:22.710 --> 02:42:25.380
but like that's what me and your job,

3005
02:42:25.381 --> 02:42:30.300
the reason people follow us is to hear our opinions on things.

3006
02:42:30.330 --> 02:42:33.000
You know what I mean?
If we didn't want people to know that stuff,

3007
02:42:33.050 --> 02:42:35.630
neither of us would be on Twitter.
Neither of us would be fucking comedians.

3008
02:42:35.631 --> 02:42:38.830
Right.
You just happen to disagree with this one.
Well,

3009
02:42:38.910 --> 02:42:40.620
it's not just that I disagree with it.

3010
02:42:40.621 --> 02:42:44.730
It's at every single comedian that I've talked to about it disagrees with it.

3011
02:42:44.750 --> 02:42:47.670
She disagrees with it vehemently and believes that you

3012
02:42:49.170 --> 02:42:52.110
popular stance,
not just that you didn't take the popular stance,

3013
02:42:52.320 --> 02:42:56.610
you didn't take the stance that comes from the people that do the job and know

3014
02:42:56.611 --> 02:43:01.260
how difficult it is to do an ad lib scenario like what Tosh was doing and to

3015
02:43:01.261 --> 02:43:03.930
have someone on ironically shout out,

3016
02:43:03.931 --> 02:43:06.990
actually rape has never funny while he was talking about how rape isn't fun.

3017
02:43:06.990 --> 02:43:08.970
And again,
like now we're getting back to like defending the heckler.

3018
02:43:08.971 --> 02:43:11.560
Like I'm not defending the fucking heckler are,
I don't know.

3019
02:43:11.561 --> 02:43:14.950
This is by saying that what he's done is bad.

3020
02:43:15.160 --> 02:43:19.930
You're saying that what she did was not as bad and what he did only existed

3021
02:43:19.931 --> 02:43:24.580
because she did something right.
Holla.
But again,

3022
02:43:24.820 --> 02:43:28.090
like when the dude threatened me like that then become a big thing.

3023
02:43:28.270 --> 02:43:31.090
What do threaten Twitter?
Who threatened?
No,
no,
no,
the war guy.

3024
02:43:31.140 --> 02:43:33.660
Do you know what I mean with that hair?
You know what I mean?
Like,

3025
02:43:33.950 --> 02:43:37.780
like he had to become a life threat.
That guy,
the guy who said he was,
I was,

3026
02:43:37.781 --> 02:43:40.570
if I kept talking to,
he's going to be the shit at cap city.
Oh.

3027
02:43:40.750 --> 02:43:44.140
Where it's like know that's an artist like you fuck around and Austin son like

3028
02:43:44.160 --> 02:43:45.940
that sucks.
You know what I mean?

3029
02:43:45.940 --> 02:43:49.300
Like to deal with like a worse version of a heckler.
Yeah.

3030
02:43:49.301 --> 02:43:53.410
That's worse than what you did and still not so still stupid dance.
But I'm,

3031
02:43:53.440 --> 02:43:55.750
we're going to disagree on this forever.
Listen man.

3032
02:43:55.780 --> 02:43:59.510
I think ultimately though we agree that it's,

3033
02:43:59.511 --> 02:44:03.970
it's about being a good person and you what you think is that talking and joking

3034
02:44:03.971 --> 02:44:08.140
around about violent acts is not a part of being a good person.

3035
02:44:09.030 --> 02:44:12.850
I and I,
I seen out the word totally fine.
Your point culture,

3036
02:44:12.860 --> 02:44:16.300
not the rape scenarios or whatever about bikes specifically,

3037
02:44:16.301 --> 02:44:19.580
like the punchline is the person who's right.
I think that's fucking lazy,

3038
02:44:19.870 --> 02:44:22.930
lazy comedy,
just like racial stereotypes,
I think,
or it's fucking lazy.

3039
02:44:22.931 --> 02:44:25.660
I think people can be funnier and more creative than that.
Yes,

3040
02:44:25.870 --> 02:44:28.570
I totally see that.
I don't delete think it's lazy.

3041
02:44:28.571 --> 02:44:31.530
I think it was the perfect thing to say and that scenario,
if,
if,

3042
02:44:31.540 --> 02:44:34.770
if it's been reported exactly the way I described,
how does it,

3043
02:44:34.810 --> 02:44:38.080
that's really what happened.
Yeah.
I don't,
you know what?
He's just joking.

3044
02:44:38.110 --> 02:44:41.670
He's just everyone pretending that this is some sort of a real national debate.

3045
02:44:41.860 --> 02:44:46.300
Look,
one in six commonality is we should be nice to each other for sure,

3046
02:44:46.301 --> 02:44:50.140
but it's also reality is you should yell out stupid shit at a comedy club and

3047
02:44:50.170 --> 02:44:51.010
here's another reality.

3048
02:44:51.011 --> 02:44:53.620
There's a lot of dumb people that don't know they're dumb and that's part of

3049
02:44:53.621 --> 02:44:57.510
being dumb and you know,
and you,
you have this fucking wild ass stupid opinion.

3050
02:44:57.520 --> 02:44:59.050
You'd think the whole world should here.
Right?

3051
02:44:59.120 --> 02:45:00.460
And you want to stand up and yell at,

3052
02:45:00.461 --> 02:45:02.410
I mean I had it a couple of weeks ago in Calgary,

3053
02:45:02.590 --> 02:45:05.590
some dumb guy just stood up and started yelling something in the middle of show

3054
02:45:05.591 --> 02:45:07.240
and we have to wait while he gets kicked out.

3055
02:45:07.420 --> 02:45:08.860
And he was like yelling and laughing.

3056
02:45:08.861 --> 02:45:12.730
Then he got kicked out and everyone is booing at them.
It's a part of life.

3057
02:45:12.760 --> 02:45:14.620
You're going to have to deal with that sort of a thing.

3058
02:45:14.800 --> 02:45:17.890
But when you're a stand up comic,
you know what the fuck he's doing.

3059
02:45:17.950 --> 02:45:19.150
You know what he's going through.

3060
02:45:19.151 --> 02:45:22.480
He's not supporting rape and he's certainly not supporting rape culture,

3061
02:45:22.481 --> 02:45:24.790
which supports rape.
He's not,
he's telling a joke.

3062
02:45:25.180 --> 02:45:28.150
He's doing a joke just as if he would be doing a joke about murdering somebody.

3063
02:45:28.180 --> 02:45:32.230
I just think you've got to pick a team so on.
We're on teams.
Stand up.
All right.

3064
02:45:32.520 --> 02:45:36.040
Damn it.
Listen this Friday we've got a killer show here at the Ice House,

3065
02:45:36.041 --> 02:45:39.880
Ladies and gentlemen.
It's getting deeper as we speak.
Greg Fitz Simmons,

3066
02:45:40.030 --> 02:45:43.100

3068
02:45:46.931 --> 02:45:48.780

more.
Have a secret.

3069
02:45:49.260 --> 02:45:53.830
Let's just say somebody that will be really good if he,
if he tells me yes,

3070
02:45:53.831 --> 02:45:57.070
he's going to tell me yes or no,
and it's a Jeffrey Ross.
Me.
Oh,

3071
02:45:57.071 --> 02:45:59.590
Jeff Ross would be awesome as the show starts tonight.

3072
02:45:59.591 --> 02:46:02.800
Don't sit in the front row.
It's Jeff Ross.
Yeah.
Um,
yeah,

3073
02:46:02.801 --> 02:46:07.510

All right.
Thank you Jamie.

3074
02:46:07.511 --> 02:46:09.980

you know,
we,</v>

3076
02:46:13.011 --> 02:46:16.400
we can all have our differences of opinions on things and you know,

3077
02:46:16.401 --> 02:46:19.370
and I know I got a little aggressive with you,
hearing held you to the fire,

3078
02:46:19.371 --> 02:46:23.960
but in no way is it that I disrespect you or don't like you or like hanging out

3079
02:46:23.961 --> 02:46:26.570
with you.
We're talking to you or it's just,

3080
02:46:26.571 --> 02:46:29.060
it's a tricky situation and it's very passionate one to me.

3081
02:46:29.061 --> 02:46:33.110
And of course rape is terrible.
Folks with a bat.
Conti behaviors.
Terrible

3082
02:46:34.990 --> 02:46:38.390

Brian coin.
I got your back son 20 plus years later.

3084

Holla at your boy if he's still alive.
Wow.

Come on folks.

3099
02:47:38.541 --> 02:47:40.670
We can agree to disagree.

3100
02:47:40.770 --> 02:47:45.620
<v 4>Benign,
much raping my timeline.
I'm sure his time where is more.</v>

3101
02:47:45.621 --> 02:47:49.150
There is more than one in six rape threats in my timeline.
Come on folks.

3102
02:47:49.151 --> 02:47:53.710
You don't have to rape.
Jamie's the time.
79 mentioned garden,

3103
02:47:54.350 --> 02:47:59.330
but seven times,
seven times you fucked seven times.
You pull

3104
02:47:59.330 --> 02:48:00.710
<v 3>over and over again.
Look,
folks,</v>

3105
02:48:01.160 --> 02:48:03.770
love and happiness is the only key to life if you want to,

3106
02:48:03.860 --> 02:48:06.710
if you want to be a happy person,
you got to do a couple of times.
One,

3107
02:48:06.711 --> 02:48:10.400
you got to get your own shit together so that nice people would want to be

3108
02:48:10.401 --> 02:48:13.400
around you,
okay?
Because if you don't have your own shit together,

3109
02:48:13.401 --> 02:48:15.200
you're not going to attract nice people.
It's just a fact.

3110
02:48:15.201 --> 02:48:16.670
Nice people don't want to deal with your bullshit.

3111
02:48:16.820 --> 02:48:18.410
And if they do deal with your bullshit,

3112
02:48:18.530 --> 02:48:21.560
you're making them a victim and they're enabling you,
so get it together.

3113
02:48:21.561 --> 02:48:23.120
You dirty fucking freaks.

3114
02:48:23.540 --> 02:48:27.800
Thanks to ana.com go buy yourself some Alpha brain to get clear thoughts like

3115
02:48:27.801 --> 02:48:32.000
these.
