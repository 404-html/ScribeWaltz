<v Speaker 1>you sort of embody the idea of hardening</v>

20
00:00:45.661 --> 00:00:47.250
<v Speaker 1>your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

<v Speaker 1>life and you become that guy for a lot </v>

<v Speaker 1>including me online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've talked about you on the podcasts a</v>

<v Speaker 1>How'd you become that guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

29
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.760
<v Speaker 1>I grew up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that guy.</v>

30
00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of people put a title on me.</v>

31
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.940
<v Speaker 1>They went to a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they see me now.</v>

32
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.180
<v Speaker 1>They see me now as the guy with his </v>
<v Speaker 1>shirt off,</v>

33
00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:23.820
<v Speaker 1>we can do 4,030</v>
<v Speaker 1>pull ups and 17 hours.</v>

34
00:01:23.821 --> 00:01:28.350
<v Speaker 1>You can run five miles and 39 hours who </v>
<v Speaker 1>can do all this crazy shit.</v>

35
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.830
<v Speaker 1>But when they don't understand is they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't understand the journey that it </v>

36
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.221
<v Speaker 1>took me to get to this point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what got me to this point was I was </v>

37
00:01:37.221 --> 00:01:38.790
<v Speaker 1>just the opposite of what I end the day.</v>

38
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.330
<v Speaker 1>I was that guy who ran away from </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely everything that I got in </v>

39
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.101
<v Speaker 1>front of me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not many people knew that I had two </v>

40
00:01:49.101 --> 00:01:52.191
<v Speaker 1>people at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at like the real me was like this very </v>

41
00:01:52.191 --> 00:01:56.421
<v Speaker 1>scared,</v>
<v Speaker 1>insecure stuttering got beat up by his </v>

42
00:01:56.421 --> 00:01:59.430
<v Speaker 1>dad and all this kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I built this fake person that walked</v>

43
00:01:59.431 --> 00:02:02.840
<v Speaker 1>around like my shit didn't stink,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

44
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was,</v>

45
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.650
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of how I did it and I do a </v>
<v Speaker 1>process of time.</v>

46
00:02:07.651 --> 00:02:10.380
<v Speaker 1>I realized that I was lying to myself </v>
<v Speaker 1>lying to people.</v>

47
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.890
<v Speaker 1>But it's a fascinating journey though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you are that guy now when you </v>

48
00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.540
<v Speaker 1>genuinely are legit bad ass at one point</v>

<v Speaker 1>How did,</v>

51
00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.360

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

52
00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.100

<v Speaker 1>I was always afraid.</v>

70
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.150
<v Speaker 1>My whole life I was afraid of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had this fucking voice,</v>

71
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.740
<v Speaker 1>this conscience that would always be </v>
<v Speaker 1>battling me saying,</v>

72
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.370
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta get up and do something.</v>

73
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.460
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to do shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

74
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.140
<v Speaker 1>I was just afraid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would that,</v>

75
00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:31.840
<v Speaker 1>that voice would force me to get up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my dad,</v>

76
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to beat him up or whatever at </v>

77
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.221
<v Speaker 1>six and I get my ass kicked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this went on for several years and </v>

78
00:03:38.221 --> 00:03:38.290
<v Speaker 1>have a big time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lauren disability can.</v>

79
00:03:38.291 --> 00:03:39.970
<v Speaker 1>My Dad didn't believe in us going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>

80
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.540
<v Speaker 1>So my dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was about the business,</v>

81
00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.900
<v Speaker 1>the skating rink and the bar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the skating rink opened by 7:00</v>

82
00:03:46.901 --> 00:03:49.600
<v Speaker 1>at night and this time I was able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>walk.</v>

83
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:50.980
<v Speaker 1>So about five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

84
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.330
<v Speaker 1>four or five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six years old,</v>

85
00:03:52.331 --> 00:03:53.020
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine.</v>

86
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.650
<v Speaker 1>And I go to the skating rink is 7:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>at night.</v>

87
00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.850
<v Speaker 1>And I worked the skating rink until 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>at night and then we will scrape the gum</v>

88
00:04:00.851 --> 00:04:05.851
<v Speaker 1>off the floors and we cleaned the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>skating rink up and then my dad had an </v>

89
00:04:05.851 --> 00:04:09.360
<v Speaker 1>office in my brother and myself asleep </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the office and my momma go upstairs </v>

90
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.190
<v Speaker 1>and work the bar until 3:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the morning and then they cleaned the</v>

91
00:04:12.191 --> 00:04:12.640
<v Speaker 1>bar up.</v>

92
00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.970
<v Speaker 1>So after all that shit was done with </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to school,</v>

93
00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.700
<v Speaker 1>rarely happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when I went to school,</v>

94
00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.280
<v Speaker 1>I was all kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

95
00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.030
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my learning disability,</v>

96
00:04:22.031 --> 00:04:27.031
<v Speaker 1>I had social anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just a jacked up kid from living </v>

97
00:04:27.031 --> 00:04:28.930
<v Speaker 1>in this tortured home from the outside </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking in.</v>

98
00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:34.140
<v Speaker 1>We lived in an all white neighborhood </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we would travel to the ghetto </v>

99
00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.690
<v Speaker 1>of buffalo in New York with the skating </v>
<v Speaker 1>rink.</v>

100
00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:36.220
<v Speaker 1>Was that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we,</v>

101
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we worked around mostly blacks and I </v>

102
00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.161
<v Speaker 1>lived around mostly whites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no one knew what was going on in </v>

103
00:04:44.161 --> 00:04:44.320
<v Speaker 1>that house to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>onto a one paradise road.</v>

104
00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:45.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

105
00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.450
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

106
00:04:46.451 --> 00:04:51.451
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mom got courage to finally leave him </v>

107
00:04:51.451 --> 00:04:52.450
<v Speaker 1>when I was eight years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We moved to a small town in Brazil,</v>

108
00:04:52.451 --> 00:04:55.300
<v Speaker 1>Indiana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's when the real war started for</v>

109
00:04:55.301 --> 00:04:56.470
<v Speaker 1>me and Brazil.</v>

110
00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.300
<v Speaker 1>Indiana is a small town,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great people,</v>

111
00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:03.390
<v Speaker 1>a lot of great people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I say that because a lot people get </v>

112
00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:04.690
<v Speaker 1>offended and I'm going to get to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>point where they get offended.</v>

113
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.710
<v Speaker 1>There was about maybe 10 black families </v>
<v Speaker 1>at about 10,000</v>

114
00:05:08.711 --> 00:05:13.711
<v Speaker 1>people in town and in 1995,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the KKK march the fourth of July parade.</v>

115
00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.290
<v Speaker 1>So this was a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>not everybody was racist.</v>

116
00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.330
<v Speaker 1>It was a lot of good people in the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>people I knew was there,</v>

117
00:05:19.331 --> 00:05:20.830
<v Speaker 1>but there was also a lot of racism </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

118
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.850
<v Speaker 1>So me being one of the few black kids </v>
<v Speaker 1>net in that area,</v>

119
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

120
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.120
<v Speaker 1>it kind of haunts you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had stuff in my notebook,</v>

121
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nigga,</v>

122
00:05:28.691 --> 00:05:30.820
<v Speaker 1>we're going to kill you on my Spanish </v>
<v Speaker 1>notebook.</v>

123
00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.650
<v Speaker 1>They had that on my car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nigga,</v>

124
00:05:32.651 --> 00:05:35.510
<v Speaker 1>we're going to kill this early nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

125
00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.650
<v Speaker 1>so even though I showed it didn't hurt </v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

126
00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:39.850
<v Speaker 1>it was jack and me up.</v>

127
00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:42.790
<v Speaker 1>So all the insecurities I have and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a kid with my father.</v>

128
00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:48.210
<v Speaker 1>I've moved into this area here and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>just got worse and worse and worse and </v>

129
00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:53.431
<v Speaker 1>it haunted me and that voice that talked</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it kept talking louder and louder </v>

130
00:05:53.531 --> 00:05:58.531
<v Speaker 1>and louder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was doing nothing about it and I </v>

131
00:05:58.531 --> 00:06:02.091
<v Speaker 1>decided to make moves and I cheated all </v>
<v Speaker 1>through school and it's kind of humbling</v>

132
00:06:02.781 --> 00:06:05.440
<v Speaker 1>to top of my stories sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is,</v>

133
00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.820
<v Speaker 1>it's also embarrassing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

134
00:06:07.821 --> 00:06:12.821
<v Speaker 1>it's real is who the fuck I am is what I</v>
<v Speaker 1>am as it's created me and copy from the </v>

135
00:06:13.491 --> 00:06:18.491
<v Speaker 1>fourth grade to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to my junior year in high school on </v>

136
00:06:18.491 --> 00:06:19.940
<v Speaker 1>every assignment and I want to get in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the military.</v>

137
00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:23.480
<v Speaker 1>When I joined the Air Force and the guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>gave me as vap test,</v>

138
00:06:23.481 --> 00:06:28.481
<v Speaker 1>it's like a watered down and sat and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't copy on it because the guy </v>

139
00:06:28.481 --> 00:06:29.240
<v Speaker 1>beside me had a test a test b.</v>

140
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.630
<v Speaker 1>They got him a right tessie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I've looked the copy on this test and</v>

141
00:06:32.631 --> 00:06:35.270
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't copy on her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I got like a 20 and I wanted to be an</v>

142
00:06:35.271 --> 00:06:40.271
<v Speaker 1>air force pararescueman as guys that </v>
<v Speaker 1>jump out of airplanes and saved down </v>

143
00:06:40.271 --> 00:06:40.271
<v Speaker 1>pilots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

144
00:06:40.271 --> 00:06:44.910
<v Speaker 1>it's a special operator in the air force</v>
<v Speaker 1>and my score was so horribly low that as</v>

145
00:06:44.961 --> 00:06:47.510
<v Speaker 1>we take it again and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

146
00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:50.300
<v Speaker 1>I got an 18 the second time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even worse,</v>

147
00:06:50.301 --> 00:06:52.550
<v Speaker 1>I need to get a 50 out of a [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 1>99.</v>

148
00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:58.090
<v Speaker 1>And so my mom and I for a while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we lived in a government subsidized </v>

149
00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:01.661
<v Speaker 1>apartments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>$7 a month and also food stamps and we </v>

150
00:07:01.661 --> 00:07:04.520
<v Speaker 1>slowly moved up to $230 a month place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at the time,</v>

151
00:07:04.521 --> 00:07:05.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

152
00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.070
<v Speaker 1>pretty poor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm,</v>

153
00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:12.800
<v Speaker 1>my mom afforded enough money for me to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go to see a tutor one one hour a week.</v>

154
00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:16.250
<v Speaker 1>So for four hours a month and had six </v>
<v Speaker 1>months to study for our last test.</v>

155
00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take the Asvab test three </v>
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>

156
00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:24.550
<v Speaker 1>And I studied my ass off and passed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I got in the air force and realized </v>

157
00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:26.990
<v Speaker 1>there was more things in front of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was afraid of water,</v>

158
00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:31.460
<v Speaker 1>terrify the water and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned how to swim.</v>

159
00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:35.930
<v Speaker 1>But what gets everybody in this training</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all special ops training is to water</v>

160
00:07:35.931 --> 00:07:38.300
<v Speaker 1>confidence where they try to pretty much</v>
<v Speaker 1>drowned your ass,</v>

161
00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:43.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of our lives we've been breathing </v>

162
00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.090
<v Speaker 1>and they take that from you and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to see how comfortable you are in </v>

163
00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:49.311
<v Speaker 1>the water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's only one percent African </v>

164
00:07:49.311 --> 00:07:50.650
<v Speaker 1>Americans in special operations and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't know anything about African,</v>

165
00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:52.220
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of them are negative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>buoyant,</v>

166
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:54.800
<v Speaker 1>which I am because the bone density.</v>

167
00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:59.690
<v Speaker 1>I struggled but I'm six weeks into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>program there was about 25 guys left.</v>

168
00:07:59.691 --> 00:08:03.380
<v Speaker 1>I have about 150.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was there and I was never.</v>

169
00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:08.470
<v Speaker 1>I didn't go to sleep for six weeks of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the program and I wanted to quit so </v>

170
00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:09.500
<v Speaker 1>badly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it quit everything in my life.</v>

171
00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:12.200
<v Speaker 1>I copied through school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to prove people wrong.</v>

172
00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:18.040
<v Speaker 1>And so here I am in this air force </v>
<v Speaker 1>program starting to get a little more </v>

173
00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:21.251
<v Speaker 1>confidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this water was kicking my ass and </v>

174
00:08:21.251 --> 00:08:23.660
<v Speaker 1>six weeks in the program that Dr gave me</v>
<v Speaker 1>a blood test and was I have sickle cell,</v>

175
00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.410
<v Speaker 1>sickle cell trait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not The anemia but still kill people,</v>

176
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:32.950
<v Speaker 1>but so they pulled me out training for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>week and when you go from being very </v>

177
00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:37.091
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable in that water situation </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then now you're comfortable and I'm </v>

178
00:08:37.091 --> 00:08:37.780
<v Speaker 1>sitting back watching the guys drown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

179
00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:42.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not part of the activities anymore </v>

180
00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:42.830
<v Speaker 1>for this week.</v>

181
00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:42.830
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't get back in that damn water </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

182
00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:47.390
<v Speaker 1>So the fear overcame me and all my </v>
<v Speaker 1>insecurities from my dad from this small</v>

183
00:08:47.391 --> 00:08:52.391
<v Speaker 1>town,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from everything started coming back and </v>

184
00:08:52.391 --> 00:08:53.120
<v Speaker 1>even though no one knew how fucked up I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was kind of create this other person who</v>

185
00:08:53.121 --> 00:08:55.890
<v Speaker 1>was tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I live with shit all the time,</v>

186
00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:58.920
<v Speaker 1>so me not wanting to go back in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>

187
00:08:58.921 --> 00:09:00.900
<v Speaker 1>The doctor called me back up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought to get like a,</v>

188
00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:04.620
<v Speaker 1>like a medical kick out of the military.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So no quinten for me.</v>

189
00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:07.620
<v Speaker 1>They kicked me out so I can have some </v>
<v Speaker 1>pride that Dr said,</v>

190
00:09:07.621 --> 00:09:08.160
<v Speaker 1>no man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can,</v>

191
00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:09.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could put you back in the training.</v>

192
00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:13.500
<v Speaker 1>And I was like fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But after a week I'm like,</v>

193
00:09:13.501 --> 00:09:15.060
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I missed one week.</v>

194
00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:17.490
<v Speaker 1>There's only three weeks left is a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>chance,</v>

195
00:09:17.491 --> 00:09:19.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could tough this shit out and go on,</v>

196
00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:25.130
<v Speaker 1>but went back to the CEO and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>commanding officer of the program and </v>

197
00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:25.350
<v Speaker 1>the sergeant said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

198
00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.140
<v Speaker 1>you guys start from day one because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>missed,</v>

199
00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:28.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

200
00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:29.760
<v Speaker 1>that we could train him.</v>

201
00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:32.100
<v Speaker 1>And I broke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I broke.</v>

202
00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:32.730
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

203
00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:34.980
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't imagine going back through </v>
<v Speaker 1>that again.</v>

204
00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:38.310
<v Speaker 1>So I made up a lie and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

205
00:09:38.311 --> 00:09:39.960
<v Speaker 1>there's sickle cell things really scare </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

206
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:41.880
<v Speaker 1>It was the fucking water wouldn't sickle</v>
<v Speaker 1>cell.</v>

207
00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:46.200
<v Speaker 1>And I pretty much quit even though they </v>
<v Speaker 1>gave me a medical.</v>

208
00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:47.760
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I quit.</v>

209
00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:53.390
<v Speaker 1>So I'm from the age of 19 to age 22,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went into the job called Tac p where </v>

210
00:09:55.141 --> 00:09:57.120
<v Speaker 1>you control fast movers behind enemy </v>
<v Speaker 1>lines.</v>

211
00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:58.890
<v Speaker 1>Cool job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's no water.</v>

212
00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.720
<v Speaker 1>I was afraid of the water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I avoided it.</v>

213
00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:02.380
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

214
00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:06.930
<v Speaker 1>125 pounds in that timeframe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went from one 75 to almost 300,</v>

215
00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:12.110
<v Speaker 1>two to 97 was my heaviest and I started </v>
<v Speaker 1>finding things that was comfortable and </v>

216
00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:17.091
<v Speaker 1>the more things I found comfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more uncomfortable in my mind was </v>

217
00:10:17.091 --> 00:10:18.470
<v Speaker 1>because that voice I was telling you </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>

218
00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:19.560
<v Speaker 1>it always was there.</v>

219
00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.660
<v Speaker 1>I was just trying to avoid that </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscience.</v>

220
00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:27.070
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to be left alone from that </v>

221
00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:27.070
<v Speaker 1>conscious and it wouldn't leave me </v>
<v Speaker 1>alone.</v>

222
00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:29.820
<v Speaker 1>So I got out of the air force and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>started working for job corps.</v>

223
00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:34.850
<v Speaker 1>Ecolab re spray for cockroaches at 24 </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm spraying a different stake in </v>

224
00:10:36.071 --> 00:10:37.650
<v Speaker 1>shakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>red lobster,</v>

225
00:10:37.651 --> 00:10:39.210
<v Speaker 1>whatever from 11:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>at night at 7:00</v>

226
00:10:39.211 --> 00:10:41.250
<v Speaker 1>in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what changed?</v>

227
00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:43.530
<v Speaker 1>I came home and watched this discovery </v>
<v Speaker 1>channel show,</v>

228
00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:45.540
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>class to 24.</v>

229
00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.600
<v Speaker 1>I came home from steak and shake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sprayed it down last,</v>

230

<v Speaker 1>mini donuts from 7:11.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I drive home for 45 minutes.</v>

<v Speaker 1>and that's where everything changed for </v>

238
00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:14.780
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I uh,</v>

239
00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:15.000
<v Speaker 1>was taking a shower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I walked out here,</v>

240
00:11:15.001 --> 00:11:20.001
<v Speaker 1>these guys and I watched the show and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>made me reflect big time on the piece of</v>

241
00:11:20.371 --> 00:11:23.760
<v Speaker 1>shit that I am and I'm exactly what </v>
<v Speaker 1>people said I was going to be.</v>

242
00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:29.560
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what was on this show that really </v>

243
00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:29.560
<v Speaker 1>struck home?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

244
00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:32.991
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw these guys going into water so I </v>

245
00:11:32.991 --> 00:11:35.871
<v Speaker 1>was terrified of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I can't even express have you </v>

246
00:11:35.871 --> 00:11:37.320
<v Speaker 1>ever had a big fear and I know a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighters have fears and stuff like that,</v>

247
00:11:37.321 --> 00:11:42.321
<v Speaker 1>but they get over them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of us have these fears that </v>

248
00:11:42.321 --> 00:11:43.670
<v Speaker 1>you just don't want to fucking face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

249
00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:49.130
<v Speaker 1>I have a lot of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a lot of them and that's what </v>

250
00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:49.530
<v Speaker 1>created the person who's in front of you</v>
<v Speaker 1>today and it will get into that.</v>

251
00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:55.850
<v Speaker 1>But I'm just scared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bitch is what I was an but I was </v>

252
00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:59.681
<v Speaker 1>watching these guys going through hell </v>
<v Speaker 1>week class to 24 and he's guys ringing </v>

253

<v Speaker 1>the bell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quinten dropping their helmet down,</v>

254
00:12:00.881 --> 00:12:05.881
<v Speaker 1>rolling out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of guys is leaving and it made me </v>

255
00:12:05.881 --> 00:12:07.510
<v Speaker 1>reflect on my fears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my insecurities,</v>

256
00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:11.950
<v Speaker 1>and I saw real men wear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought were real men who are staying,</v>

257
00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:17.430
<v Speaker 1>who are overcoming adversity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who were overcoming all these different </v>

258
00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:19.320
<v Speaker 1>things that I had blamed so many fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in my life.</v>

259
00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:24.040
<v Speaker 1>My Dad met my mom for not being there </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was 14 years old.</v>

260
00:12:24.041 --> 00:12:26.650
<v Speaker 1>My mom was gonna get remarried to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>great guy.</v>

261
00:12:26.651 --> 00:12:30.580
<v Speaker 1>He got murdered and then I moved back to</v>
<v Speaker 1>a small town in Brazil and,</v>

262
00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:34.600
<v Speaker 1>and everybody was applying my learning </v>
<v Speaker 1>disability,</v>

263

<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

<v Speaker 1>meet me being everything.</v>

265
00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:39.550
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

266
00:12:39.551 --> 00:12:41.140
<v Speaker 1>I sat there for awhile and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

<v Speaker 1>No one's going to fucking come to help </v>

270
00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:51.760
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I had to man up and I said,</v>

271
00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:54.310
<v Speaker 1>first it got started doing his face in </v>
<v Speaker 1>every fucking fear,</v>

272
00:12:54.311 --> 00:12:56.230
<v Speaker 1>a half,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter what the fuck it is,</v>

273
00:12:56.231 --> 00:12:56.660
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

274
00:12:57.050 --> 00:13:02.050
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and these things would keep me up at </v>

275
00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:03.931
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one p people who are hearing this </v>

276
00:13:03.931 --> 00:13:05.941
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will never really understand and </v>

277
00:13:05.941 --> 00:13:06.550
<v Speaker 1>grasp when you face these things and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>many things,</v>

278
00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:08.770
<v Speaker 1>how they keep you up and haunt you at </v>
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>

279
00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:13.980
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a lot of people out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there that know what you're talking </v>

280
00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:13.980
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

281
00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:13.980
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's what it did.</v>

282
00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:18.960
<v Speaker 1>And I had two options to either be that </v>
<v Speaker 1>300 pound guy who's spraying for </v>

283
00:13:19.901 --> 00:13:21.820
<v Speaker 1>cockroaches and made a thousand dollars </v>
<v Speaker 1>a month.</v>

284
00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:26.560
<v Speaker 1>And at 24 years old knowing without 50 </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking years old,</v>

285
00:13:26.561 --> 00:13:29.560
<v Speaker 1>I can reflect on this and think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>what guy never became.</v>

286
00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:34.950
<v Speaker 1>Or I can totally just sack it up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fail and fail and fail entire succeed.</v>

287
00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:38.410
<v Speaker 1>So I started calling recruiters up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

288
00:13:38.411 --> 00:13:39.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go be a fucking navy seal.</v>

289
00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:42.760
<v Speaker 1>And every recruiter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a weight and height,</v>

290
00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:47.820
<v Speaker 1>his weight and height limit for to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the military and I was six foot one </v>

291
00:13:47.891 --> 00:13:51.760
<v Speaker 1>and two 97 and I had a prior service </v>
<v Speaker 1>which was a big deal.</v>

292
00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.130
<v Speaker 1>So I called all these recruiters up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of them said,</v>

293
00:13:54.131 --> 00:13:55.600
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what're you blah blah blah blah.</v>

294
00:13:55.601 --> 00:14:00.601
<v Speaker 1>They got into conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve Vai is even qualified and by the </v>

295
00:14:00.601 --> 00:14:02.020
<v Speaker 1>time I got to my weight would hang up </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much like,</v>

296
00:14:02.021 --> 00:14:02.550
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

297
00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:05.200
<v Speaker 1>call somebody else and they'll try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get in the reserves.</v>

298
00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:10.710
<v Speaker 1>So I tried to get the reserves and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>called this guy named Steven Sal job </v>

299
00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:10.710
<v Speaker 1>recruiter up and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

300
00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:10.710
<v Speaker 1>come on in.</v>

301
00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:12.970
<v Speaker 1>He saw me put me through the weight </v>
<v Speaker 1>standard,</v>

302
00:14:12.971 --> 00:14:17.971
<v Speaker 1>all this other stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to get into the class I had to get </v>

303
00:14:17.971 --> 00:14:18.790
<v Speaker 1>into how to lose 106 pounds in less than</v>
<v Speaker 1>three months.</v>

304
00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:21.550
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck that.</v>

305
00:14:21.551 --> 00:14:26.551
<v Speaker 1>I can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I grabbed my chocolate milkshake and </v>

306
00:14:26.551 --> 00:14:26.551
<v Speaker 1>went back to Ecolab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to back to work,</v>

307
00:14:26.551 --> 00:14:27.340
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is my life.</v>

308
00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:33.060
<v Speaker 1>So in this job you look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're looking for cockroaches looking </v>

309
00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:36.781
<v Speaker 1>for rodents and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this next morning or the next night </v>

310
00:14:36.781 --> 00:14:39.880
<v Speaker 1>I went to work and I hit the all that </v>
<v Speaker 1>cockroach is too much.</v>

311
00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:45.300
<v Speaker 1>I hit the mother of cockroaches and this</v>
<v Speaker 1>restaurant got full of cockroaches and </v>

312
00:14:45.611 --> 00:14:48.460
<v Speaker 1>rodents and everything else and I sat </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and said,</v>

313
00:14:48.461 --> 00:14:50.380
<v Speaker 1>this is my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

314
00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:53.690
<v Speaker 1>this is my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are exactly who the fuck this is it.</v>

315
00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:56.510
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this ain't going to be it for me.</v>

316
00:14:57.290 --> 00:15:00.560
<v Speaker 1>So in that restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I quit my job,</v>

317
00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:02.550
<v Speaker 1>left my canister in that restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

318
00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:07.630
<v Speaker 1>my spray canister,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got back in my ecolab truck and I went </v>

319
00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:10.360
<v Speaker 1>home and I started working out like </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody I was.</v>

320
00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:13.430
<v Speaker 1>I became the most obsessed person on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>planet earth.</v>

321
00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:18.970
<v Speaker 1>And I was basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to invent a guy that didn't exist.</v>

322
00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:22.310
<v Speaker 1>I had to invent a guy that can take any </v>
<v Speaker 1>pain,</v>

323
00:15:22.311 --> 00:15:24.350
<v Speaker 1>any suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any kind of judgment,</v>

324
00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:30.190
<v Speaker 1>be called nigger because whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck in the world and be able to stand </v>

325
00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:30.190
<v Speaker 1>in the fucking room and say go fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

326
00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:33.950
<v Speaker 1>And it built out to build this callous </v>
<v Speaker 1>mine and I built it through suffering.</v>

327
00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:37.760
<v Speaker 1>I built it to downright fucking just </v>
<v Speaker 1>crushing myself.</v>

328
00:15:37.761 --> 00:15:39.290
<v Speaker 1>If it was raining outside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>3:00</v>

329
00:15:39.291 --> 00:15:40.580
<v Speaker 1>in the fucking morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was snowing.</v>

330
00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:43.520
<v Speaker 1>The fourth thing is don't go out there </v>
<v Speaker 1>and do shit.</v>

331
00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:47.030
<v Speaker 1>My instinct was we got to fucking go out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

332
00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:52.220
<v Speaker 1>Anything that was fucking horrible in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>life that I would normally say no,</v>

333
00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:55.940
<v Speaker 1>that was inhumane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that most people I had to go do it.</v>

334
00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:59.870
<v Speaker 1>And I started callous in my mind at this</v>
<v Speaker 1>point in my life.</v>

335
00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:04.730
<v Speaker 1>And I lost the weight and lost weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I went back to recruiter.</v>

336
00:16:04.731 --> 00:16:09.731
<v Speaker 1>I got into that class and I went through</v>
<v Speaker 1>three navy seal hell weeks in one year.</v>

337
00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:12.850
<v Speaker 1>Only guy to ever be in three hell weeks </v>
<v Speaker 1>in one year.</v>

338
00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:14.660
<v Speaker 1>To my knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first one,</v>

339
00:16:14.661 --> 00:16:16.280
<v Speaker 1>I didn't make it through the next two I </v>
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>

340
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:20.030
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I just didn't,</v>

341
00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:24.710
<v Speaker 1>I didn't stop it anymore from there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I started realizing through this,</v>

342
00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:29.630
<v Speaker 1>through this process that the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind is what you created.</v>

343
00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:33.230
<v Speaker 1>And I started opening different doors </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I didn't think were even there.</v>

344
00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:36.230
<v Speaker 1>They didn't think even existed in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>more doors opened up,</v>

345
00:16:36.231 --> 00:16:40.730
<v Speaker 1>the more I started realizing that my </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential is damn near endless it.</v>

346
00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:44.620
<v Speaker 1>And it changed my whole mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I went from David Goggins,</v>

347
00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:49.640
<v Speaker 1>I created Goggins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that journey is a priceless journey </v>

348
00:16:50.211 --> 00:16:55.211
<v Speaker 1>that is hard for me to even explain to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people because it sounds so quick and </v>

349
00:16:55.211 --> 00:16:56.150
<v Speaker 1>easy that guys lost this weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I went through three hell weeks.</v>

350
00:16:56.151 --> 00:17:01.151
<v Speaker 1>I went to ranger school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to Delta Force lex into whatever </v>

351
00:17:01.151 --> 00:17:01.151
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was brutal.</v>

352
00:17:01.151 --> 00:17:03.560
<v Speaker 1>It's a brutal journey every fucking day </v>
<v Speaker 1>and every well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>just a snippet of it.</v>

355
00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:14.530
<v Speaker 1>Where I'm at today is in front of Joe </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rogan telling you my life to get </v>

356
00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:18.551

<v Speaker 1>I became to get through where I'm at </v>

357
00:17:18.551 --> 00:17:21.251
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing but prior to half for </v>

358
00:17:21.251 --> 00:17:21.950
<v Speaker 1>myself that I can't really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't really show people because I had</v>

359
00:17:21.951 --> 00:17:24.020
<v Speaker 1>this face and his face that they see </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

360
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:25.070
<v Speaker 1>are you happy?</v>

361
00:17:25.070 --> 00:17:26.990
<v Speaker 1>What's wrong with you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm driven,</v>

362
00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:30.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm obsessed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what you see said.</v>

363
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:33.860
<v Speaker 1>People need to hear the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a.</v>

364
00:17:33.861 --> 00:17:38.861
<v Speaker 1>This is an exciting story for people </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's a lot of people out </v>

365
00:17:38.861 --> 00:17:41.801
<v Speaker 1>there that field trapped and they feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuck and they feel like they can't do </v>

366
00:17:41.801 --> 00:17:41.801
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is who they are.</v>

367
00:17:41.801 --> 00:17:46.590
<v Speaker 1>You're a guy who felt that exact same </v>
<v Speaker 1>way but figured out how to not be that </v>

368
00:17:46.791 --> 00:17:49.070
<v Speaker 1>person and be a person that you would </v>
<v Speaker 1>admire.</v>

369
00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:51.900
<v Speaker 1>How did you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What were the first steps?</v>

370
00:17:51.901 --> 00:17:54.300
<v Speaker 1>Like you had some slips before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

371
00:17:54.301 --> 00:17:56.430
<v Speaker 1>Because you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You quit because of the water thing,</v>

372
00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:58.170
<v Speaker 1>but then when you went back the second </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

373
00:17:58.171 --> 00:18:01.560
<v Speaker 1>when you decide you're going to lose all</v>
<v Speaker 1>that weight and you quit that job did.</v>

374
00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:06.780
<v Speaker 1>Did you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it just straightforward from there </v>

375
00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:09.441
<v Speaker 1>or whether there's some days where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>just failed and then you picked it back </v>

376
00:18:09.441 --> 00:18:09.441
<v Speaker 1>up again?</v>

377
00:18:09.441 --> 00:18:11.250
<v Speaker 1>So my first run when I decided to lose </v>
<v Speaker 1>the weight,</v>

378
00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:16.280
<v Speaker 1>I was like I said to 97,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was about 32 percent body fat and my </v>

379
00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:20.280
<v Speaker 1>idea was to run four miles from my first</v>
<v Speaker 1>run.</v>

380
00:18:20.281 --> 00:18:22.500
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know how bad it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking hurt me.</v>

381
00:18:22.501 --> 00:18:24.330
<v Speaker 1>I used to run before I was fat and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

382
00:18:24.331 --> 00:18:25.230
<v Speaker 1>fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can do this.</v>

383
00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:30.760
<v Speaker 1>I ran a quarter mile and walked home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I walked home and sat on my couch and </v>

384
00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:34.821
<v Speaker 1>cried.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to my mom's house who was about </v>

385
00:18:34.821 --> 00:18:36.120
<v Speaker 1>40 about maybe 20 minutes down the road </v>
<v Speaker 1>and cried and getting her out.</v>

386
00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:36.430
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

387
00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:38.030
<v Speaker 1>I can't fucking do this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

388
00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:40.150
<v Speaker 1>When do I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

389
00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:43.420
<v Speaker 1>just got somebody pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My life was this fucking.</v>

390
00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:45.870
<v Speaker 1>I was making thousand dollars a month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My rent was eight,</v>

391
00:18:45.871 --> 00:18:50.871
<v Speaker 1>10 a month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my mind just kept fucking with me </v>

392
00:18:50.871 --> 00:18:50.871
<v Speaker 1>and kept fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not good enough,</v>

393
00:18:50.871 --> 00:18:50.871
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

394
00:18:50.871 --> 00:18:53.010
<v Speaker 1>This isn't for you man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These guys are bass motherfuckers on the</v>

395
00:18:53.011 --> 00:18:54.180
<v Speaker 1>planet earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not that.</v>

396
00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:58.260
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it was,</v>

397
00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:00.900
<v Speaker 1>and it's kind of funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was obsessed with rocky,</v>

398
00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:07.280
<v Speaker 1>rocky one in particular and now as a kid</v>
<v Speaker 1>I come everyday now watch this fucking </v>

399
00:19:08.851 --> 00:19:11.880
<v Speaker 1>show rocky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would fast forward with the little</v>

400
00:19:11.881 --> 00:19:16.881
<v Speaker 1>vhs tapes to round 14.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Around 14 fucked me up like nobody's </v>

401
00:19:18.061 --> 00:19:20.460
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why this song came on,</v>

402
00:19:20.461 --> 00:19:21.940
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when I bought the pull up record,</v>

403
00:19:21.941 --> 00:19:26.941
<v Speaker 1>I listened to the song for 17 hours is </v>
<v Speaker 1>two minutes and 13 seconds and I'm able </v>

404
00:19:27.871 --> 00:19:32.871
<v Speaker 1>to visualize and dream like nobody's </v>
<v Speaker 1>business and I know that I can create a </v>

405
00:19:34.831 --> 00:19:38.270
<v Speaker 1>vision that many people can't and I work</v>
<v Speaker 1>for it.</v>

406
00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:43.280
<v Speaker 1>So the vision I had was when Apollo </v>
<v Speaker 1>creed beat the fucking shit out of </v>

407
00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:43.680
<v Speaker 1>rocky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beat the shit out of him.</v>

408
00:19:43.681 --> 00:19:44.670
<v Speaker 1>He kept fighting.</v>

409
00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:48.210
<v Speaker 1>He was a dumb fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't read,</v>

410
00:19:48.211 --> 00:19:49.680
<v Speaker 1>couldn't fuck that was me,</v>

<v Speaker 1>just punchy everything a bottom and </v>

<v Speaker 1>He turns around and sees this guy </v>

416
00:20:09.951 --> 00:20:12.000
<v Speaker 1>getting up and it was the face of Apollo</v>
<v Speaker 1>creed that changed my life.</v>

417
00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:17.900
<v Speaker 1>The face of Apollo creed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like just by that motherfucker </v>

418
00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:20.160
<v Speaker 1>getting up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not winning just by him getting the fuck</v>

419
00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:22.770
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apollo creed was champ.</v>

420
00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:25.650
<v Speaker 1>He's best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rocky had taken his soul,</v>

421
00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:29.400
<v Speaker 1>had literally taken his soul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His head goes down,</v>

422
00:20:29.401 --> 00:20:30.220
<v Speaker 1>he looks at him like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who?</v>

423
00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:34.950

<v Speaker 1>I want it to be that not rocky.</v>

424
00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:37.410
<v Speaker 1>I want to be the guy that people looked </v>
<v Speaker 1>at it,</v>

425
00:20:37.411 --> 00:20:38.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't give you like me or didn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

426
00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:43.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't care,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it said this motherfucker's gonna </v>

427
00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:45.130
<v Speaker 1>keep coming after whatever the fuck is </v>
<v Speaker 1>in front of him.</v>

428
00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:47.920
<v Speaker 1>I wanted that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted that.</v>

429
00:20:47.921 --> 00:20:50.650
<v Speaker 1>I wanted that worse than anything in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

430
00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:56.280
<v Speaker 1>so that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kept picturing me falling down and </v>

431
00:20:56.831 --> 00:20:59.080
<v Speaker 1>getting up and every motherfucker call </v>
<v Speaker 1>me nigger.</v>

432
00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:00.970
<v Speaker 1>I was dumped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even myself,</v>

433
00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:06.630
<v Speaker 1>even myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to feel something besides two </v>

434
00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:10.321
<v Speaker 1>feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want it to go the distance and that </v>

435
00:21:10.321 --> 00:21:14.281
<v Speaker 1>going a distance pushed me to a point of</v>
<v Speaker 1>where now go way past the distance.</v>

436
00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:20.100
<v Speaker 1>So you go the first day you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you run a quarter mile and you walked </v>

437
00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:20.410
<v Speaker 1>back home and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're upset.</v>

438
00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:21.790
<v Speaker 1>How do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you move forward?</v>

439
00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:26.500
<v Speaker 1>So basically what I did was I came home </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I had a chocolate milkshake.</v>

440
00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:28.630
<v Speaker 1>I sat down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gave up.</v>

441
00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:30.510
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this ain't gonna fucking happen.</v>

442
00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:32.750
<v Speaker 1>I can lose 100,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six pounds and I can't even go a quarter</v>

443
00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:33.430
<v Speaker 1>a fucking mile.</v>

444
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.000
<v Speaker 1>I started being able to take negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit and be happy.</v>

445
00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:44.650
<v Speaker 1>And this whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>

446
00:21:44.651 --> 00:21:46.390
<v Speaker 1>what if a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds Corny,</v>

447
00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:48.100
<v Speaker 1>it sounds weak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's true.</v>

448
00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:52.420
<v Speaker 1>One of the recruiters said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not many black navy salesman.</v>

449
00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:54.970
<v Speaker 1>I was a 36 African American steel in </v>
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>

450
00:21:55.650 --> 00:21:58.780
<v Speaker 1>It's an overset careers because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking water,</v>

451
00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:00.460

<v Speaker 1>I mean people get mad at me.</v>

452
00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.050
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just get over it.</v>

453
00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:06.060
<v Speaker 1>And so I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

454

<v Speaker 1>what would it be if my fucking fat dumb </v>
<v Speaker 1>lie in to be friends with people?</v>

455

<v Speaker 1>that would,</v>

456
00:22:18.041 --> 00:22:20.160

00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:22.900
<v Speaker 1>that dreamer mentality just with always </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuel me.</v>

458
00:22:23.530 --> 00:22:24.180
<v Speaker 1>It was fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

459
00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:26.770
<v Speaker 1>what if I can be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if I can be a seal man,</v>

460
00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:31.060
<v Speaker 1>what if I can go from wearing a quarter </v>
<v Speaker 1>of fucking mile now are going toward and</v>

461
00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:31.840
<v Speaker 1>five miles.</v>

462
00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:35.800
<v Speaker 1>What if I can go with just what if I can</v>
<v Speaker 1>go in and,</v>

463
00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:38.750
<v Speaker 1>and what if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would that feel if I'm graduating,</v>

464
00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:41.420
<v Speaker 1>kind of get at that graduation thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked about 2:24</v>

465
00:22:41.421 --> 00:22:46.421
<v Speaker 1>that I like the video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sat down and watched this man officer </v>

466
00:22:46.421 --> 00:22:47.060
<v Speaker 1>stood up and he said to the graduation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

467
00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:49.360
<v Speaker 1>gas graduate graduating buds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 18 of them,</v>

468
00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:51.940
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we live in a society where mediocrity is</v>

469
00:22:51.941 --> 00:22:56.941
<v Speaker 1>often rewarded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he went on to say something about </v>

470
00:22:56.941 --> 00:22:59.790
<v Speaker 1>these men detest mediocrity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I wanted to be a man that detest </v>

471
00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:01.810
<v Speaker 1>mediocrity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It all,</v>

472
00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:06.840
<v Speaker 1>it got me a lot of trouble in the seal </v>
<v Speaker 1>teams and going forward in my life </v>

473
00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:08.620
<v Speaker 1>because I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started looking down on people for not</v>

474
00:23:08.621 --> 00:23:13.621
<v Speaker 1>going hardest fucking shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I started to create different </v>

475
00:23:13.621 --> 00:23:14.140
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's for a different day.</v>

476
00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:16.230
<v Speaker 1>But I just believed that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

477
00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:17.140
<v Speaker 1>my whole mind changed.</v>

478
00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:20.470
<v Speaker 1>That is a problem that a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>work hard to have.</v>

479
00:23:20.471 --> 00:23:24.110
<v Speaker 1>You get angry at people who don't work </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard to the point where you,</v>

480
00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:25.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to insult them,</v>

481
00:23:25.691 --> 00:23:27.490
<v Speaker 1>you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to smack them,</v>

482
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.460
<v Speaker 1>and it's really because you're scared of</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing that in yourself.</v>

483
00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:32.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's probably the truth.</v>

484
00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:37.720
<v Speaker 1>That's probably the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I guess a lot of times month I would </v>

485
00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:41.581
<v Speaker 1>see people and it probably was a direct </v>
<v Speaker 1>reflection of who I was and I would get </v>

486
00:23:41.581 --> 00:23:46.411
<v Speaker 1>mad at them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in reflection it's probably just be </v>

487
00:23:46.411 --> 00:23:46.411
<v Speaker 1>getting mad at myself for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 percent when I,</v>

488
00:23:46.411 --> 00:23:48.020
<v Speaker 1>when I see people that are half assed </v>
<v Speaker 1>and things,</v>

489
00:23:48.021 --> 00:23:51.080
<v Speaker 1>I get terrified of seeing that in myself</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I get mad at them.</v>

490
00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:52.420
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

491
00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:55.260
<v Speaker 1>it's not a good way to handle it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

492
00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:58.910
<v Speaker 1>but it's natural because you're just </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrified of seeing that trait.</v>

493
00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:00.170
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it cost me.</v>

494
00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:03.770
<v Speaker 1>So you come back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do the quarter mile,</v>

495
00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:05.360
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You walk back home.</v>

496
00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:07.070
<v Speaker 1>How do you regroup?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what I did,</v>

497
00:24:07.071 --> 00:24:11.240
<v Speaker 1>I sat down there and I put rocky and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>got my milkshake rocky.</v>

498
00:24:11.241 --> 00:24:14.540
<v Speaker 1>I seen what I was big time in rocky and </v>
<v Speaker 1>platoon.</v>

499
00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:19.960
<v Speaker 1>Why Platoon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love to see people who were getting </v>

500
00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:23.621
<v Speaker 1>beat down and there's scenes they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>scenes that this drove me and people in </v>

501
00:24:23.901 --> 00:24:24.550
<v Speaker 1>my hell weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

502
00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:29.600
<v Speaker 1>I was in three of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd always hear me singing these </v>

503
00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:29.600
<v Speaker 1>songs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these songs,</v>

504
00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:31.580
<v Speaker 1>humming these songs in torturous </v>
<v Speaker 1>situations when you're,</v>

505
00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:33.710
<v Speaker 1>when everybody's quitting this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>code.</v>

506
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:38.180
<v Speaker 1>I would be somewhere gone somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking gone.</v>

507
00:24:38.181 --> 00:24:41.680
<v Speaker 1>If somewhere fucking dark as shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a senior platoon when he lies,</v>

508
00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:47.160
<v Speaker 1>when Barnes shoots relias and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think he likes his dad and the </v>

509
00:24:47.181 --> 00:24:49.790
<v Speaker 1>choppers are taken off and Charlie </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sheen's,</v>

510
00:24:49.791 --> 00:24:51.710
<v Speaker 1>ask him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know Tom Berenger,</v>

511
00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:52.990
<v Speaker 1>Rizzy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Elias,</v>

512
00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:54.500
<v Speaker 1>regionalized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>William Defoe.</v>

513
00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:59.800
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found them back their dead somewhere </v>

514
00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:02.500
<v Speaker 1>and through the woods the Viet Cong is </v>
<v Speaker 1>chasing he through the woods and shoot </v>

515
00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:04.730
<v Speaker 1>him in his fucking back and all he wants</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do is get to the fucking chopper.</v>

516
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.410
<v Speaker 1>He's getting shot in his back is getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

517
00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:11.440
<v Speaker 1>getting shot back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's getting up and you see this guy </v>

518
00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:13.961
<v Speaker 1>who's fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love the fucking guy who just fucking </v>

519
00:25:13.961 --> 00:25:17.531
<v Speaker 1>fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I put these things in as </v>

520
00:25:17.531 --> 00:25:18.500
<v Speaker 1>reminders that you're going to have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking suffer,</v>

521
00:25:18.501 --> 00:25:20.540
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This fucking point two,</v>

522
00:25:20.541 --> 00:25:21.110
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

523
00:25:21.111 --> 00:25:26.111
<v Speaker 1>this man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have to fucking suffer </v>

524
00:25:26.111 --> 00:25:26.111
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

525
00:25:26.111 --> 00:25:30.090
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go from this fat insecure </v>

526
00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:33.191
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the best guys on the planet </v>

527
00:25:33.191 --> 00:25:33.191
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This journey's could take something that</v>

528
00:25:33.191 --> 00:25:38.141
<v Speaker 1>is going to be incomprehensible to most </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and these different </v>

529
00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:41.870
<v Speaker 1>visualizations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How I visualize it in my self talk,</v>

530
00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:47.110
<v Speaker 1>it became so nasty and dirty that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost liked the fact that I went point </v>

531
00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:47.110
<v Speaker 1>two five.</v>

532
00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:50.360
<v Speaker 1>So it became from being defeated too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

533
00:25:50.361 --> 00:25:51.670
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right motherfucker.</v>

534
00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:53.420
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe the Marvin go point seven,</v>

535
00:25:53.421 --> 00:25:54.460
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

536
00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:58.400
<v Speaker 1>it just became this different mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I turn negatives into positives,</v>

537
00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:00.430
<v Speaker 1>so I will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will take it like who?</v>

538
00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:03.140
<v Speaker 1>Who would even think about doing this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would sit in my car saying,</v>

539
00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:05.960
<v Speaker 1>who had two 97?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who can't fucking swim?</v>

540
00:26:05.961 --> 00:26:07.820
<v Speaker 1>That gray,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who scared the fucking water?</v>

541
00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:11.780
<v Speaker 1>We had the fucking balls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little balls to fucking man up,</v>

542
00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:16.010
<v Speaker 1>quit a job and go and it put everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>on himself.</v>

543
00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:21.730
<v Speaker 1>So it's how I started talking to myself </v>
<v Speaker 1>and put myself in a whole different </v>

544
00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:25.451
<v Speaker 1>category that would fuel me the next day</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I just kept using that as fuel and </v>

545
00:26:25.451 --> 00:26:25.730
<v Speaker 1>fuel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one would do this shit.</v>

546
00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:31.120
<v Speaker 1>No one would do this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're the baddest motherfucker around </v>

547
00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:31.120
<v Speaker 1>your bass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Motherfucker ever live.</v>

548
00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:35.290
<v Speaker 1>And I had ice kept fueling me with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the right kind of message that I </v>

549
00:26:35.290 --> 00:26:35.290
<v Speaker 1>needed to hear.</v>

550
00:26:35.290 --> 00:26:40.090
<v Speaker 1>That was never telling myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And through time it became reality to </v>

551
00:26:40.851 --> 00:26:45.851
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you start out on the first day and </v>

552
00:26:45.851 --> 00:26:47.280
<v Speaker 1>then do you start running again the </v>
<v Speaker 1>second day?</v>

553
00:26:47.530 --> 00:26:48.990
<v Speaker 1>Second day we're wrapped back after it </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

554
00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:51.180
<v Speaker 1>But I started realizing I can't run that</v>
<v Speaker 1>far.</v>

555
00:26:51.390 --> 00:26:56.390
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea was I became damn near a </v>

556
00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:56.390
<v Speaker 1>professional cyclist with the miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put it on the bike.</v>

557
00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:59.700
<v Speaker 1>So I never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we never watched TV.</v>

558
00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:02.460
<v Speaker 1>I had to be doing something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was riding the bike.</v>

559
00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:06.380
<v Speaker 1>I rode a bike a lot to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to lose the first initial kind of weight</v>

560
00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:09.690
<v Speaker 1>because my bones were hurting so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My bio is broken.</v>

561
00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:12.780
<v Speaker 1>I learned to get over that also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I tried to swim a lot,</v>

562
00:27:12.781 --> 00:27:15.840
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't a great swimmer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but putting fins on kind of equalized my</v>

563
00:27:15.841 --> 00:27:16.890
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't so negative,</v>

564
00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:19.740
<v Speaker 1>buoyant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I started fitting a whole bunch and I</v>

565
00:27:19.741 --> 00:27:22.410
<v Speaker 1>spent hours in the pool hours in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pool,</v>

566
00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:23.820
<v Speaker 1>trying to get more and more comfortable.</v>

567
00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:28.820
<v Speaker 1>Not because I was going underwater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was so scared of the water that I had </v>

568
00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:32.481
<v Speaker 1>to live in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The water had to become one with the </v>

569
00:27:32.481 --> 00:27:33.480
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So going into the pool used to scare me.</v>

570
00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:37.260
<v Speaker 1>So I went to the pool an awful awful </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot.</v>

571
00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:41.340
<v Speaker 1>And then the bike got easier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was able to run more.</v>

572
00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:46.580
<v Speaker 1>I went from like one mile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one mile was a great accomplishment to </v>

573
00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:48.090
<v Speaker 1>miles and then from two to three was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>big.</v>

574
00:27:48.091 --> 00:27:52.470
<v Speaker 1>And then I went from three to six and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then like they have a warning order that</v>

575
00:27:52.471 --> 00:27:57.471
<v Speaker 1>they get people to get ready for butts </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the whole thing was running six </v>

576
00:27:57.471 --> 00:27:58.410
<v Speaker 1>miles five days a week and that was my </v>
<v Speaker 1>goal.</v>

577
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.140
<v Speaker 1>And so I just kept.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I failed,</v>

578
00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:04.650
<v Speaker 1>I go back to scratch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I use some positive motivation.</v>

579
00:28:04.651 --> 00:28:06.570
<v Speaker 1>I have like one day where I'm like </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking defeated,</v>

580
00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:12.290
<v Speaker 1>but I started realizing this is part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the process that's a part of that </v>

581
00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:12.290
<v Speaker 1>journey.</v>

582
00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:15.260
<v Speaker 1>I had to realize this is part of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>process versus just saying like I used </v>

583
00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:15.420
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just not good enough.</v>

584
00:28:16.090 --> 00:28:17.910
<v Speaker 1>If I'm not good enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we always say that shit,</v>

585
00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:19.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm just not good enough and then try </v>
<v Speaker 1>something else.</v>

586
00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:23.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to fucking make myself good </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough and that became my mentality.</v>

587
00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:24.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna.</v>

588
00:28:24.731 --> 00:28:28.170
<v Speaker 1>Make myself good enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I'm misunderstood a lot,</v>

589
00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:30.900
<v Speaker 1>but that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all it came down to.</v>

590
00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:35.960
<v Speaker 1>I made myself good enough and the days I</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't run that for the next week I </v>

591
00:28:36.961 --> 00:28:40.140
<v Speaker 1>would do two a days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so on the running,</v>

592
00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:43.830
<v Speaker 1>if I ran a quarter of a mile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I waited fucking couple of hours.</v>

593
00:28:43.831 --> 00:28:44.970
<v Speaker 1>It haunt me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bother me.</v>

594
00:28:45.210 --> 00:28:46.740
<v Speaker 1>I tried to run a half mile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next time,</v>

595
00:28:46.770 --> 00:28:49.620
<v Speaker 1>same day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do more than this.</v>

596
00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:54.860
<v Speaker 1>If I had to walk out and walk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just became just a process of </v>

597
00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:54.960
<v Speaker 1>grinding and grinding and grinding.</v>

598
00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:59.960
<v Speaker 1>Not even a good word for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not even a good word for it and </v>

599
00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:02.400
<v Speaker 1>just just going further and further and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then when I got through running,</v>

600
00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:04.560
<v Speaker 1>I go to the bike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go to the pool.</v>

601
00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:06.840
<v Speaker 1>If I got tired somewhere and my legs </v>
<v Speaker 1>were tired,</v>

602
00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:12.260
<v Speaker 1>I go to the gym and I developed this </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy workout where I was doing volume </v>

603
00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:16.200
<v Speaker 1>like two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>300 reps of like very lightweight.</v>

604
00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:17.220
<v Speaker 1>People are saying how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

605
00:29:17.221 --> 00:29:22.221
<v Speaker 1>how come you don't have any loose skin?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My workout routine in the gym became </v>

606
00:29:22.221 --> 00:29:22.950
<v Speaker 1>sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It became sick.</v>

607
00:29:22.951 --> 00:29:24.390
<v Speaker 1>I was just doing two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>300 reps,</v>

608
00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:29.070
<v Speaker 1>400 reps on my chest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like for one simple exercise,</v>

609
00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:33.000
<v Speaker 1>the best press and a racket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get back on it.</v>

610
00:29:33.001 --> 00:29:34.920
<v Speaker 1>Just rep it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trying to burn as many calories.</v>

611
00:29:34.921 --> 00:29:37.710
<v Speaker 1>I can't build that muscle mass and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>just became.</v>

612
00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:39.030
<v Speaker 1>Just became obsessed with it.</v>

613
00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:44.420
<v Speaker 1>So when you're doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you at all about repetitive stress </v>

614
00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:47.971
<v Speaker 1>injuries or the fact that your body's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not conditioned for this and you're </v>

615
00:29:47.971 --> 00:29:50.940
<v Speaker 1>basically taking your body?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were you abused it and now you're </v>

616
00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:52.060
<v Speaker 1>forcing it to live?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like in an elite athlete?</v>

617
00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:54.100
<v Speaker 1>I didn't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know any better.</v>

618
00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:56.200
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

619
00:29:56.410 --> 00:29:56.920
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

620
00:29:56.930 --> 00:29:59.890
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Working out that harbor.</v>

621
00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:01.450
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did it.</v>

622
00:30:01.451 --> 00:30:02.440
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

623
00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:07.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one reason why I went through </v>

624
00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:07.620
<v Speaker 1>three hell weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So don't talk about a lot.</v>

625
00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:12.270
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stress of my life getting to 24 </v>

626
00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:12.930
<v Speaker 1>caused me have some serious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as it's used,</v>

627
00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:15.670
<v Speaker 1>I know anything about this shit too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as muscles,</v>

628
00:30:15.671 --> 00:30:20.671
<v Speaker 1>what we use as your hip flexor muscle </v>
<v Speaker 1>and basically under stress it starts to </v>

629
00:30:20.671 --> 00:30:22.870
<v Speaker 1>tighten up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I wish I stuttered for,</v>

630
00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:25.570
<v Speaker 1>from the time I was in third grade time </v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in seventh grade.</v>

631
00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:28.140
<v Speaker 1>White blotches on my skin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just,</v>

632
00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:33.300
<v Speaker 1>I was a nutcase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the insides of me or are also </v>

633
00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:34.870
<v Speaker 1>getting fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in this process,</v>

634
00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:39.940
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my psoas muscle got real tight to my </v>

635
00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:40.810
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can show you the bumper in the back of</v>

636
00:30:40.811 --> 00:30:43.000
<v Speaker 1>my head after this show's over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I had,</v>

637
00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:48.030
<v Speaker 1>I started going this fucking like large </v>
<v Speaker 1>tumor looking bumper in the back of my </v>

638
00:30:48.030 --> 00:30:50.110
<v Speaker 1>head from my body compressing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm six foot one,</v>

639
00:30:50.111 --> 00:30:55.111
<v Speaker 1>but my muscles were like five foot nine </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I just started just the muscle </v>

640
00:30:55.111 --> 00:30:57.940
<v Speaker 1>tightness for my solo as go into my t 12</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours,</v>

641
00:30:57.941 --> 00:30:59.470
<v Speaker 1>just getting tighter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My quads,</v>

642
00:30:59.471 --> 00:31:02.350
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting tired from distress to stress in</v>

643
00:31:02.351 --> 00:31:07.351
<v Speaker 1>my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the more I stress my body with the </v>

644
00:31:07.351 --> 00:31:08.950
<v Speaker 1>workouts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my lower body became out of balance.</v>

645
00:31:09.370 --> 00:31:13.120
<v Speaker 1>So I had a bunch of stress fractures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of injuries going through buds.</v>

646
00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:18.600
<v Speaker 1>And how I got through buds was they gave</v>
<v Speaker 1>me my third time was my last time going </v>

647
00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:22.000
<v Speaker 1>through hell week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I basically put a black sock on at 4:00</v>

648
00:31:22.001 --> 00:31:23.910
<v Speaker 1>in the morning and I would get duct </v>
<v Speaker 1>tape.</v>

649
00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:28.070
<v Speaker 1>I had at numerous stress fractures on </v>
<v Speaker 1>both of my legs because my kid,</v>

650
00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:32.460
<v Speaker 1>my body was literally like coming in on </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself and my legs were like I was.</v>

651
00:31:32.550 --> 00:31:36.670
<v Speaker 1>I was protonating really bad and putting</v>
<v Speaker 1>stress on my stress on my shins.</v>

652
00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:40.390
<v Speaker 1>And so I would put duct tape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>duct taped my feet and I will show you.</v>

653
00:31:40.391 --> 00:31:45.391
<v Speaker 1>The top of them will have pressure </v>
<v Speaker 1>ulcers that were the size of quarters </v>

654
00:31:45.391 --> 00:31:45.391
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

655
00:31:45.391 --> 00:31:49.450
<v Speaker 1>how the ankle joint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the foot goes to the Shin and how you</v>

656
00:31:49.451 --> 00:31:51.760
<v Speaker 1>move this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the tape was so tight,</v>

657
00:31:52.330 --> 00:31:55.480
<v Speaker 1>it just created a nice ulcer right </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

658
00:31:55.930 --> 00:31:57.580
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

659
00:31:57.581 --> 00:31:59.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just kept going through it.</v>

660
00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:01.720
<v Speaker 1>So you just use that tape to just </v>
<v Speaker 1>support your ankles.</v>

661
00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:06.750
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I basically kept myself and for the </v>

662
00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:06.750
<v Speaker 1>first 30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>45 minutes,</v>

663
00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:10.591
<v Speaker 1>the pain was excruciating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then it would go numb and I would go</v>

664
00:32:10.751 --> 00:32:13.400
<v Speaker 1>numb and then that's how I got through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

665
00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:17.650
<v Speaker 1>Do any longterm damage?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

666
00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:22.710
<v Speaker 1>I've been out for five years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I retired from the 21 years in the </v>

667
00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:24.940
<v Speaker 1>military at the time in the air force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I did about 16 years in the navy.</v>

668
00:32:24.970 --> 00:32:26.350
<v Speaker 1>How old are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forty three.</v>

669
00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:28.720
<v Speaker 1>Seems like you're 30.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>

670
00:32:29.050 --> 00:32:29.860
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you really,</v>

671
00:32:29.861 --> 00:32:34.861
<v Speaker 1>you look very young for your age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whenever I'm stressed I get after I </v>

672
00:32:34.861 --> 00:32:36.250
<v Speaker 1>fixed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fixed was ever bothering me.</v>

673
00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:37.840
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

674
00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:42.320
<v Speaker 1>basically over the last five years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything I've done in my life,</v>

675
00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:44.620
<v Speaker 1>I did it being very unhealthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

676
00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:45.830
<v Speaker 1>I'd never talked about it.</v>

677
00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:49.310
<v Speaker 1>I just kept going and it costs me pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>

678
00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:52.010
<v Speaker 1>I was choking my insides out adrenal </v>
<v Speaker 1>issues,</v>

679
00:32:52.011 --> 00:32:53.900
<v Speaker 1>tons of the general issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thyroid issues,</v>

680
00:32:54.290 --> 00:32:56.690
<v Speaker 1>anything with inner consistent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much shut down on me.</v>

681
00:32:57.210 --> 00:32:59.450
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my organs were pretty much shutting down</v>

682
00:32:59.870 --> 00:33:04.870
<v Speaker 1>and I went from a guy who could run 200,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five miles to guy who couldn't get out </v>

683
00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:05.510
<v Speaker 1>of bed and the doctors were trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>search what was wrong.</v>

684
00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:07.070
<v Speaker 1>That's what I figured out the soda as </v>
<v Speaker 1>muscle.</v>

685
00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:10.730
<v Speaker 1>No one had figured it out and I hit it </v>
<v Speaker 1>by accident.</v>

686
00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:16.180
<v Speaker 1>So I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've missed two days of stretching out </v>

687
00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:19.331
<v Speaker 1>in five years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what happened was all the Shit I </v>

688
00:33:19.331 --> 00:33:19.860
<v Speaker 1>did to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stress I was under,</v>

689
00:33:19.861 --> 00:33:21.020
<v Speaker 1>her physical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mental,</v>

690
00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:25.400
<v Speaker 1>all kinds of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just choked me out from the inside.</v>

691
00:33:25.401 --> 00:33:30.401
<v Speaker 1>And doctors put me all kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>medication and the medication started </v>

692
00:33:30.401 --> 00:33:31.910
<v Speaker 1>doing the exact opposite of what kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>shirt I was on.</v>

693
00:33:31.910 --> 00:33:33.700
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dah da.</v>

694
00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:37.710
<v Speaker 1>I was on some different things too for </v>
<v Speaker 1>my estrogen,</v>

695
00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:39.140
<v Speaker 1>different things for my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

696
00:33:39.770 --> 00:33:44.770
<v Speaker 1>I was on anything to do with your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like with your endocrine system of </v>

697
00:33:44.770 --> 00:33:46.910
<v Speaker 1>thyroid medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm good.</v>

698
00:33:46.911 --> 00:33:48.500
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was on quarters.</v>

699
00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:53.620
<v Speaker 1>All kinds of shit to get my stuff and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this lump in my throat from like </v>

700
00:33:53.751 --> 00:33:56.450
<v Speaker 1>the heart was always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't run down the street.</v>

701
00:33:56.990 --> 00:33:58.730
<v Speaker 1>My body was just jacked up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't sleep.</v>

702
00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:02.330
<v Speaker 1>My whole body was just shutting down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could give you a lot more than that,</v>

703
00:34:02.331 --> 00:34:06.110
<v Speaker 1>but just give an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was fucking dying and so I couldn't do</v>

704
00:34:06.111 --> 00:34:08.530
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went from a guy who is this God,</v>

705
00:34:08.531 --> 00:34:10.580
<v Speaker 1>you're a guy who can't do shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Dr.</v>

706
00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:11.700
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't know what's wrong with you </v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

707
00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:13.070
<v Speaker 1>You know your labs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your.</v>

708
00:34:13.071 --> 00:34:15.590
<v Speaker 1>This is what ptsd is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on?</v>

709
00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:17.180
<v Speaker 1>I knew what any of that shit.</v>

710
00:34:17.930 --> 00:34:19.850
<v Speaker 1>So I sat in the bed one day and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>realized,</v>

711
00:34:19.851 --> 00:34:20.810
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my life is over.</v>

712
00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:26.110
<v Speaker 1>This is it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it gave me time to reflect on </v>

713
00:34:26.110 --> 00:34:29.531
<v Speaker 1>everything I had accomplished because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd never taken time to reflect on the </v>

714
00:34:29.531 --> 00:34:31.130
<v Speaker 1>kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was the man I am now.</v>

715
00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:33.350
<v Speaker 1>So honestly the time I wasn't working </v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

716
00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:38.920
<v Speaker 1>it was the best time of my life because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a chance to really reflect back </v>

717
00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:40.280
<v Speaker 1>and be proud of who I became.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never took time to do that.</v>

718
00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:43.340
<v Speaker 1>It was like one after another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get the fuck after,</v>

719
00:34:43.341 --> 00:34:45.050
<v Speaker 1>get after it after you ain't good </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>

720
00:34:45.051 --> 00:34:46.370
<v Speaker 1>Motherfucker get after it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get after it.</v>

721
00:34:47.180 --> 00:34:49.160
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got halted.</v>

722
00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:52.190
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this process went on for a while,</v>

723
00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:53.480
<v Speaker 1>more medication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This isn't working,</v>

724
00:34:53.481 --> 00:34:55.700
<v Speaker 1>that's not working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No doctor can figure it out.</v>

725
00:34:56.390 --> 00:34:57.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>

726
00:34:57.590 --> 00:35:01.970
<v Speaker 1>I saw this dark about eight years before</v>
<v Speaker 1>this happened and he was like,</v>

727
00:35:01.971 --> 00:35:03.800
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're so fucking tight.</v>

728
00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:06.200
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen anybody in my life as </v>
<v Speaker 1>tight as you.</v>

729
00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:08.860
<v Speaker 1>You need 50,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours of stress.</v>

730
00:35:08.861 --> 00:35:10.760
<v Speaker 1>And he used throughout some crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>number.</v>

731
00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:12.500
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

732
00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:13.310
<v Speaker 1>stretching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

733
00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:17.130
<v Speaker 1>stretching stress is bad for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you thought stretch was bad.</v>

734
00:35:17.170 --> 00:35:20.120
<v Speaker 1>I was just baffled that I read some </v>
<v Speaker 1>article,</v>

735
00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:21.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know man.</v>

736
00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:23.720
<v Speaker 1>Fucking fuck stretching man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

737
00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:26.160
<v Speaker 1>I worked out so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd have time to stress,</v>

738
00:35:26.161 --> 00:35:26.390
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

739
00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:29.480
<v Speaker 1>I was running about 150 miles a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was back in the mouse.</v>

740
00:35:29.481 --> 00:35:30.390
<v Speaker 1>I was getting after it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

741
00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:34.610
<v Speaker 1>I was working a full time job and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>stretching and doing that.</v>

742
00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:39.940
<v Speaker 1>So my body was literally getting tighter</v>
<v Speaker 1>and tighter just from what I was doing </v>

743
00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:39.940
<v Speaker 1>about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you ran this.</v>

744
00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:40.320
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't that man.</v>

745
00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:42.860
<v Speaker 1>And so I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

746
00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:47.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to try and stretch out so I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do anything for like 10 minutes or</v>

747
00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:49.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do the six minute abs bullshit.</v>

748
00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:52.950
<v Speaker 1>So I started stressing out one hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hour and a half.</v>

749
00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:54.690
<v Speaker 1>Long story short,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

750
00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:59.720
<v Speaker 1>I shaved my head almost every morning </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that bump does on the back of my </v>

751
00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:01.170
<v Speaker 1>fucking head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started realizing it was shrinking for</v>

752
00:36:01.171 --> 00:36:06.171
<v Speaker 1>some fucking reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why because I shaved my </v>

753
00:36:06.171 --> 00:36:06.171
<v Speaker 1>head back and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's getting smaller.</v>

754
00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:09.820
<v Speaker 1>It's more that bump got healthier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got smarter.</v>

755
00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:11.100
<v Speaker 1>That bump guy was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

756
00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:13.560
<v Speaker 1>hold up motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But with what's going on that.</v>

757
00:36:13.570 --> 00:36:15.720
<v Speaker 1>So whereas most of us started getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>more and more stressed out,</v>

758
00:36:15.721 --> 00:36:20.721
<v Speaker 1>more and more relaxed and over a period </v>
<v Speaker 1>of five years from the best shape of my </v>

759
00:36:20.721 --> 00:36:23.100
<v Speaker 1>damn life right now from stretching out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

760
00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:24.480
<v Speaker 1>That's all it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went from like,</v>

761
00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:26.910
<v Speaker 1>I can't even count the medications I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

762
00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:31.290
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm on a very low dose thyroid pill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>

763
00:36:31.530 --> 00:36:33.900
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever do yoga all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

764
00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:35.270
<v Speaker 1>All the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

765
00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:40.300
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I were to tell somebody one thing </v>

766
00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:40.300
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

767
00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:43.790
<v Speaker 1>that's so as muscle and getting that hip</v>
<v Speaker 1>flexor opened up because we're all </v>

768
00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:47.130
<v Speaker 1>stressed the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was much worse than others.</v>

769
00:36:47.250 --> 00:36:49.200
<v Speaker 1>It changed my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

770
00:36:49.210 --> 00:36:50.940
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you say nick?</v>

771
00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:53.250
<v Speaker 1>Regardless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you say his last name?</v>

772
00:36:53.370 --> 00:36:58.370
<v Speaker 1>The a Brazilian jujitsu black belt from </v>
<v Speaker 1>England Greek fellow.</v>

773
00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:03.860
<v Speaker 1>He has a great quote about yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said Yoga is a martial art you do </v>

774
00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:03.860
<v Speaker 1>against yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

775
00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:06.460
<v Speaker 1>It's a great way of putting it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent.</v>

776
00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:08.100
<v Speaker 1>So it feels like when you're in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

777
00:37:08.130 --> 00:37:11.610
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you.</v>

778
00:37:12.210 --> 00:37:14.590
<v Speaker 1>How many years ago was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was five years ago.</v>

779
00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:18.030
<v Speaker 1>And how long was there a period where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't work out at all?</v>

780
00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:23.480
<v Speaker 1>There was about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I always try to do something but I </v>

781
00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:26.331
<v Speaker 1>couldn't run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could run maybe half a mile and all </v>

782
00:37:26.331 --> 00:37:30.171
<v Speaker 1>that shit would happen and my heart </v>
<v Speaker 1>would get a fib and all kinds of stuff </v>

783
00:37:30.171 --> 00:37:31.850
<v Speaker 1>would happen and I started just </v>
<v Speaker 1>stretching and also I try to do pull ups</v>

784
00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:32.520
<v Speaker 1>every now and then.</v>

785
00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:35.340
<v Speaker 1>But everything was just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have the energy,</v>

786
00:37:35.850 --> 00:37:37.410
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

787
00:37:37.411 --> 00:37:42.411
<v Speaker 1>nothing was processed in right for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do you think that you've just broken </v>

788
00:37:42.411 --> 00:37:42.780
<v Speaker 1>your body?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You pushed it too hard?</v>

789
00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:43.760
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

790
00:37:43.770 --> 00:37:47.770
<v Speaker 1>I sat back in that bed that night and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>had a lot of time to reflect and say,</v>

791
00:37:47.771 --> 00:37:52.771
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was actually kind of proud of myself </v>

792
00:37:52.771 --> 00:37:52.771
<v Speaker 1>in a very sick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>twisted way.</v>

793
00:37:52.771 --> 00:37:53.110
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

794
00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:58.730
<v Speaker 1>even though people will understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to do what I had to do and you </v>

795
00:37:58.730 --> 00:37:59.730
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I did it.</v>

796
00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:01.650
<v Speaker 1>Like I didn't tell you how I got into </v>
<v Speaker 1>ultra running,</v>

797
00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:03.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of things that.</v>

798
00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:07.290
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I pushed extremely hard.</v>

799
00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:10.920
<v Speaker 1>I went way beyond what I thought was </v>
<v Speaker 1>capable.</v>

800
00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:13.410
<v Speaker 1>Like my first ultra race I did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a,</v>

801
00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:15.450
<v Speaker 1>I was heavier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in Iraq,</v>

802
00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:16.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the markets have trail,</v>

803
00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:17.670
<v Speaker 1>lone survivor.</v>

804
00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:20.130
<v Speaker 1>I was in buds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in three hell weeks as you know,</v>

805
00:38:20.131 --> 00:38:23.760
<v Speaker 1>as I said many times and I knew a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys that died in the operation.</v>

806
00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:25.860
<v Speaker 1>I was at free fall school with mark in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the trail.</v>

807
00:38:25.861 --> 00:38:28.830
<v Speaker 1>Who's his twin brother during the </v>
<v Speaker 1>operation where wings,</v>

808
00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:33.890
<v Speaker 1>where Marketo was the only survivor I </v>
<v Speaker 1>knew marcus trowel and I was about 200 </v>

809
00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:37.990
<v Speaker 1>some odd pounds and I didn't run Harley </v>
<v Speaker 1>all at this time.</v>

810
00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:43.200
<v Speaker 1>I was a seal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was like a bodybuilder and I did </v>

811
00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:43.930
<v Speaker 1>an elliptical trainer 20 minutes on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sunday.</v>

812
00:38:44.090 --> 00:38:46.060
<v Speaker 1>That's all I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I.</v>

813
00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:51.060
<v Speaker 1>Did I fuck that cardio stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was never about it until this </v>

814
00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:52.480
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that happened and I was like,</v>

815
00:38:52.481 --> 00:38:57.481
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got find a way to raise money for </v>

816
00:38:57.481 --> 00:38:57.481
<v Speaker 1>these families.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I googled the,</v>

817
00:38:57.481 --> 00:39:00.160
<v Speaker 1>I found the foundation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Special Operations Warrior Foundation,</v>

818
00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:02.920
<v Speaker 1>and I googled the 10 hardest races in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

819
00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:08.940
<v Speaker 1>I knew nothing about ultra running the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first I'd ever run with 20 miles at one </v>

820
00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:10.700
<v Speaker 1>time and so what came up was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>badwater 1:45</v>

821
00:39:11.450 --> 00:39:13.780
<v Speaker 1>and 35 mile run through death valley in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the summertime.</v>

822
00:39:14.650 --> 00:39:19.650
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was a fucking stage race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know people could run to her </v>

823
00:39:19.650 --> 00:39:22.481
<v Speaker 1>and 35 miles at one time had no idea was</v>
<v Speaker 1>even possibly in a stage race where you </v>

824
00:39:22.481 --> 00:39:22.481
<v Speaker 1>run like 20 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

825
00:39:22.481 --> 00:39:26.320
<v Speaker 1>camp out and then run 20 more until you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get her 35 miles.</v>

826
00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:31.380
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I want an ultra runner to know ultra </v>

827
00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:33.931
<v Speaker 1>runner was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I called the race director of Chris </v>

828
00:39:33.931 --> 00:39:35.230
<v Speaker 1>Cosmin of the bad water and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you an ultra runner?</v>

829
00:39:35.770 --> 00:39:37.540
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what that is.</v>

830
00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:42.570
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you run 100 miles in 24 hours or </v>

831
00:39:42.570 --> 00:39:42.570
<v Speaker 1>less?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

832
00:39:42.570 --> 00:39:42.570
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I said,</v>

833
00:39:42.570 --> 00:39:43.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm a navy seal.</v>

834
00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:44.980
<v Speaker 1>I was in three hell weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was arranged.</v>

835
00:39:44.981 --> 00:39:46.660
<v Speaker 1>I gave him some resume.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't give a shit.</v>

836
00:39:47.170 --> 00:39:48.280
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>

837
00:39:48.281 --> 00:39:53.281
<v Speaker 1>You got qualified for my race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the deadline was up in two months </v>

838
00:39:53.281 --> 00:39:56.881
<v Speaker 1>for this badwater race and basically he </v>
<v Speaker 1>said there's two more races you can do </v>

839
00:39:56.891 --> 00:39:59.290
<v Speaker 1>to qualify and I might consider you my </v>
<v Speaker 1>race.</v>

840
00:39:59.291 --> 00:40:02.440
<v Speaker 1>We select top 90 athletes in the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>and not even ultra runner,</v>

841
00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:04.690
<v Speaker 1>but I liked your cost like what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

842
00:40:05.350 --> 00:40:06.070
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

843
00:40:06.250 --> 00:40:08.860
<v Speaker 1>I call him up on a Wednesday and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes,</v>

844
00:40:08.861 --> 00:40:13.390
<v Speaker 1>there's a race on Saturday in San Diego,</v>
<v Speaker 1>San Diego one day when you went to run a</v>

845
00:40:13.391 --> 00:40:15.520
<v Speaker 1>one mile track for 24 hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>send miles.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get 124 hours.</v>

847
00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:21.850
<v Speaker 1>I will consider you in my race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did the math is 14,</v>

848
00:40:21.851 --> 00:40:22.990
<v Speaker 1>seven minute mile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck it.</v>

849
00:40:23.050 --> 00:40:27.640
<v Speaker 1>I can do that dumb shit thinking I'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell you that right now.</v>

850
00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:32.670
<v Speaker 1>It was rough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Verse Pain I've been in my entire life </v>

851
00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:33.760
<v Speaker 1>was this race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I have my wife at the time,</v>

852
00:40:33.761 --> 00:40:35.770
<v Speaker 1>she's now my ex wife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We go to Walmart,</v>

853
00:40:35.771 --> 00:40:38.070
<v Speaker 1>get a blue lawn chair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which crackers in mild plex.</v>

854
00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:40.330
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm gonna have for 100 mile </v>
<v Speaker 1>run.</v>

855
00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:41.860
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

856
00:40:41.861 --> 00:40:43.120
<v Speaker 1>but the start line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this race,</v>

857
00:40:43.690 --> 00:40:48.690
<v Speaker 1>it was an Aua national championships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the best ultra runners compete</v>

858
00:40:48.911 --> 00:40:53.911
<v Speaker 1>against each other to Sydney Mazda and </v>
<v Speaker 1>get 24 hours and I'm this big </v>

859
00:40:53.911 --> 00:40:58.300
<v Speaker 1>bodybuilder looking guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But back then I would say I was at least</v>

860
00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:02.510
<v Speaker 1>2:30</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least it made them more than jacked.</v>

861
00:41:02.570 --> 00:41:03.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

862
00:41:03.130 --> 00:41:05.860
<v Speaker 1>I was ripped to fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a big old chest out there.</v>

863
00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:07.290
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was jacked up.</v>

864
00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:12.300
<v Speaker 1>It was a picture of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He definitely didn't look like someone </v>

865
00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:12.300
<v Speaker 1>who could run a hundred miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

866
00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:15.100
<v Speaker 1>not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So basically I started running and I get</v>

867
00:41:15.101 --> 00:41:18.700
<v Speaker 1>to about mile 40 mile 50 and I'm feeling</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty good.</v>

868
00:41:19.390 --> 00:41:24.390
<v Speaker 1>I get to mile 70 and it was the worst </v>
<v Speaker 1>pain in my life.</v>

869
00:41:25.690 --> 00:41:29.890
<v Speaker 1>I sat down and this blue lawn chair at </v>
<v Speaker 1>mile 70 and my,</v>

870
00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:32.540
<v Speaker 1>the Ritz crackers after mile 20 became </v>
<v Speaker 1>rich.</v>

871
00:41:32.541 --> 00:41:34.310
<v Speaker 1>Cracker balls wouldn't hydrate and </v>
<v Speaker 1>correct it.</v>

872
00:41:34.311 --> 00:41:39.311
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was drinking mile plex from our </v>

873
00:41:39.311 --> 00:41:39.520
<v Speaker 1>nutrition because I couldn't eat these </v>
<v Speaker 1>risks.</v>

874
00:41:39.521 --> 00:41:42.230
<v Speaker 1>Crackers have very minimal water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if any at all.</v>

875
00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:47.620
<v Speaker 1>And I was just dying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I sat down this blue launch air as I </v>

876
00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:51.131
<v Speaker 1>was watching these windows go around in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a circle that was all dizzy and </v>

877
00:41:51.131 --> 00:41:51.131
<v Speaker 1>lightheaded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hadn't gone to the bathroom.</v>

878
00:41:51.131 --> 00:41:52.320
<v Speaker 1>It's been about 12 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm at 70 miles,</v>

879
00:41:52.321 --> 00:41:53.630
<v Speaker 1>about 12 hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is good.</v>

880
00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:56.900
<v Speaker 1>And looked at my ex wife now and I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

881
00:41:57.450 --> 00:42:02.450
<v Speaker 1>I am fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started seeing like three of her and </v>

882
00:42:02.450 --> 00:42:05.920
<v Speaker 1>once my body stopped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mind just went off and had to go to </v>

883
00:42:05.931 --> 00:42:10.931
<v Speaker 1>the bathroom and the bathroom was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like 20 feet away from me if </v>

884
00:42:10.931 --> 00:42:10.931
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

885
00:42:10.931 --> 00:42:12.740
<v Speaker 1>And I couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I sat there and pee blood down my</v>

886
00:42:12.741 --> 00:42:16.070
<v Speaker 1>leg and started crapping up my back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're 30 miles to go.</v>

887
00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:21.670
<v Speaker 1>I and my feet were broken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just in the worst shape once you </v>

888
00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:23.750
<v Speaker 1>stopped running.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not running like that.</v>

889
00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:28.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean I didn't run it almost a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just doing bodybuilding stuff and </v>

890
00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:31.130
<v Speaker 1>20 minutes on the elliptical trainer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No running at all.</v>

891
00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:33.980
<v Speaker 1>I probably ran no shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no shit,</v>

892
00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:39.500
<v Speaker 1>no more than 50 miles the whole year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't my thing.</v>

893
00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:41.310
<v Speaker 1>I want it to be like Jack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

894
00:42:41.790 --> 00:42:46.790
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to be cardio guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to be ripped big navy seal guy </v>

895
00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:50.870
<v Speaker 1>and I'm in the day before this race is </v>

<v Speaker 1>He was in the gym the Friday before I do</v>

<v Speaker 1>race and signed off on it.</v>

905
00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:12.380
<v Speaker 1>So I'm in the gym.</v>

00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:42.160
<v Speaker 1>my past life and bought six mini donuts </v>
<v Speaker 1>out there and I'll have my hat pulled </v>

915
00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:46.061
<v Speaker 1>down and at mile 70 man it was torturous</v>
<v Speaker 1>and with blood down my leg and 30 miles </v>

916
00:43:47.331 --> 00:43:48.770
<v Speaker 1>to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

917
00:43:48.771 --> 00:43:52.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>started reaching and cookie jars.</v>

918
00:43:52.070 --> 00:43:57.070
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started pulling off all kinds of </v>

919
00:43:57.070 --> 00:43:59.411
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I reached in my mind and a lot of us </v>

920
00:43:59.411 --> 00:44:02.291
<v Speaker 1>when we have bad times in life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even the hardest person where we forget </v>

921
00:44:02.291 --> 00:44:03.170
<v Speaker 1>how bad ass we are during that hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

922
00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:06.530
<v Speaker 1>I have a thing where I take a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>seconds to reflect on our.</v>

923
00:44:06.531 --> 00:44:07.100
<v Speaker 1>Hang on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

924
00:44:07.101 --> 00:44:09.260
<v Speaker 1>You've been through this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've been through that.</v>

925
00:44:09.261 --> 00:44:10.550
<v Speaker 1>You overcame this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>overcame that.</v>

926
00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:14.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't ever close my mind to the fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>that this can be done.</v>

927
00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:18.770
<v Speaker 1>And I knew I had to get up and eat </v>
<v Speaker 1>nutrition and hydration.</v>

928
00:44:18.771 --> 00:44:22.730
<v Speaker 1>I need to get it stopped being dizzy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the first thing I did.</v>

929
00:44:22.731 --> 00:44:25.360
<v Speaker 1>I didn't panic on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had 30 more miles to go to get 100.</v>

930
00:44:25.850 --> 00:44:30.850
<v Speaker 1>I started the process slowly but surely </v>
<v Speaker 1>I was able to stand up and I was </v>

931
00:44:30.850 --> 00:44:33.360
<v Speaker 1>literally hobbling around this track </v>
<v Speaker 1>with just walking,</v>

932
00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:34.590
<v Speaker 1>no running at all.</v>

933
00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:36.960
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My feet were in the worst pain,</v>

934
00:44:37.110 --> 00:44:42.110
<v Speaker 1>worst pain I've been in my entire life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing in any training is even </v>

935
00:44:42.110 --> 00:44:45.830
<v Speaker 1>comparable to this last 30 miles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what happened was my ex wife looked </v>

936
00:44:46.921 --> 00:44:47.970
<v Speaker 1>at me and she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

937
00:44:48.690 --> 00:44:50.130
<v Speaker 1>we agreed I'm not going to make the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

938
00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:53.910
<v Speaker 1>I was going way too slow and at that </v>
<v Speaker 1>time at mile 81,</v>

939
00:44:54.990 --> 00:44:57.810
<v Speaker 1>something clicked that I'll never </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably be able to do again.</v>

940
00:44:57.811 --> 00:44:58.860
<v Speaker 1>When my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>body,</v>

941
00:44:58.861 --> 00:44:59.760
<v Speaker 1>Spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>soul,</v>

942
00:44:59.761 --> 00:45:04.761
<v Speaker 1>everything is connected in my mind knew </v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't fucking around anymore and knew</v>

943
00:45:04.951 --> 00:45:09.951
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't going to quit and knew that guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>was dead and buried and gone and I was </v>

944
00:45:09.951 --> 00:45:14.721
<v Speaker 1>going to die out here on his fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>Walmart for whatever reason why I was </v>

945
00:45:14.721 --> 00:45:16.440
<v Speaker 1>going to get through this motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a damn.</v>

946
00:45:16.441 --> 00:45:18.300
<v Speaker 1>It made no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no fucking crowds.</v>

947
00:45:18.301 --> 00:45:19.470
<v Speaker 1>There's no trophy.</v>

948
00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:21.300
<v Speaker 1>At the end there was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't even in a race.</v>

949
00:45:21.330 --> 00:45:22.670
<v Speaker 1>In my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was.</v>

950
00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:25.350
<v Speaker 1>It was nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't about nothing.</v>

951
00:45:25.351 --> 00:45:27.630
<v Speaker 1>There was no nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a bunch of people didn't know who</v>

952
00:45:27.631 --> 00:45:32.631
<v Speaker 1>the fuck I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was me against me and I used all </v>

953
00:45:32.631 --> 00:45:37.401
<v Speaker 1>these different dark places to start </v>
<v Speaker 1>bringing out light and just fucking go </v>

954
00:45:37.401 --> 00:45:40.721
<v Speaker 1>in deeper and deeper in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next 20 miles I ran 101 miles and I </v>

955
00:45:41.041 --> 00:45:44.430
<v Speaker 1>ran the next 20 miles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ran and about 10:30</v>

956
00:45:44.431 --> 00:45:49.431
<v Speaker 1>pace and I did 101 miles in 18 hours and</v>
<v Speaker 1>56 minutes sat back down that Blue Porta</v>

957
00:45:52.350 --> 00:45:54.030
<v Speaker 1>potty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now my chair,</v>

958
00:45:54.031 --> 00:45:59.031
<v Speaker 1>that guy from Walmart and that's when </v>
<v Speaker 1>the body realized I was done and this </v>

959
00:45:59.881 --> 00:46:03.130
<v Speaker 1>great feeling came over me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also the worst pain in my life.</v>

960
00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:06.150
<v Speaker 1>That's when I took a humongous shit on </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>

961
00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:11.660
<v Speaker 1>Literally like I like a fucking log up </v>
<v Speaker 1>my fucking back pissed so much plugged </v>

962
00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:11.860
<v Speaker 1>them in.</v>

963
00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:15.630
<v Speaker 1>My wife was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was a nurse and she was freaked out.</v>

964
00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:17.700
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't get up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't stand up.</v>

965
00:46:17.701 --> 00:46:21.930
<v Speaker 1>She backed this camry on the knoll of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the grassy areas that,</v>

966
00:46:22.740 --> 00:46:25.560
<v Speaker 1>and we were both lifters at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so she was decently strong.</v>

967
00:46:25.561 --> 00:46:28.800
<v Speaker 1>I put my arms around her neck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she got into the backseat of the car,</v>

968
00:46:28.801 --> 00:46:31.260
<v Speaker 1>left the windows down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no like horrible shit,</v>

969
00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:34.440
<v Speaker 1>and I had this poncho liner because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>November in San Diego,</v>

970
00:46:34.441 --> 00:46:37.590
<v Speaker 1>so I'm sitting her jack him back in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>car and she was terrified.</v>

971
00:46:37.591 --> 00:46:38.570
<v Speaker 1>I need to get your doctor and you take </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

972
00:46:38.610 --> 00:46:43.430
<v Speaker 1>The doctor says take me home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we lived in a second story or,</v>

973
00:46:43.530 --> 00:46:47.220
<v Speaker 1>or the second deck of this apartment </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex in San Diego.</v>

974
00:46:47.850 --> 00:46:50.820
<v Speaker 1>I got to the first deck so I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get a car and I can stand up,</v>

975
00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:52.350
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with my arms around her neck,</v>

976
00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:53.550
<v Speaker 1>so I just leaned down.</v>

977
00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:55.590
<v Speaker 1>I was gonna pass out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got to the SEC,</v>

978
00:46:55.591 --> 00:46:58.050
<v Speaker 1>or I got to the first deck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went down,</v>

979
00:46:58.410 --> 00:47:01.230
<v Speaker 1>just couldn't stand up anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got to run her neck,</v>

980
00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:05.640
<v Speaker 1>worked my way up the railing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Government dominoes on her neck again.</v>

981
00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:08.430
<v Speaker 1>Walked to the kitchen area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is right in the front door.</v>

982
00:47:08.910 --> 00:47:11.670
<v Speaker 1>I was laying on the Poncho liner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crap was everywhere.</v>

983
00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:17.420
<v Speaker 1>I managed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She helped me managed to get into the </v>

984
00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:17.420
<v Speaker 1>toe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the tub,</v>

985
00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:18.820
<v Speaker 1>and it was like dirt was coming on my </v>
<v Speaker 1>penis.</v>

986
00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:20.930
<v Speaker 1>This looked horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a gross thing.</v>

987
00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:24.060
<v Speaker 1>The world is the worst pain I can ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever,</v>

988

<v Speaker 1>People may think that they may want to </v>

991
00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:36.571
<v Speaker 1>put a title on me after hearing me </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it makes them feel better </v>

992
00:47:36.571 --> 00:47:36.571
<v Speaker 1>because he thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

<v Speaker 1>this guy must be some special artist.</v>

<v Speaker 1>She called my mom up and my mom was </v>

998
00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:53.280
<v Speaker 1>dating a doctor at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The doctor,</v>

999
00:47:53.350 --> 00:47:55.570
<v Speaker 1>the doctor said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to get him to a hospital now.</v>

1000
00:47:56.500 --> 00:47:58.960
<v Speaker 1>She came back and all I want to do is </v>
<v Speaker 1>call Chris cost on the phone,</v>

1001
00:47:59.010 --> 00:48:00.140
<v Speaker 1>the race director,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bob Waters.</v>

1005
00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:07.870

<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>

1006
00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:09.220

<v Speaker 1>but I never thought it was humanly </v>

1009
00:48:15.721 --> 00:48:20.371
<v Speaker 1>possible to do what I did.</v>

<v Speaker 1>physical shape I've ever been in my </v>

1027
00:49:26.770 --> 00:49:29.380
<v Speaker 1>So a month later or so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a month and a half later,</v>

1028
00:49:29.381 --> 00:49:32.800
<v Speaker 1>I went to this race called the hurt 100.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how is it my race in Hawaii?</v>

1029
00:49:33.070 --> 00:49:35.010
<v Speaker 1>Twenty 6,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>feet of climbing was.</v>

1030
00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:36.640
<v Speaker 1>Ali said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all I said.</v>

1031
00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:38.910
<v Speaker 1>That's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he,</v>

1032
00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:42.010
<v Speaker 1>he's a hardcore dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't know how fucked up I was.</v>

1033
00:49:42.190 --> 00:49:43.810
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

1034
00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:45.530
<v Speaker 1>he didn't say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1035
00:49:45.630 --> 00:49:45.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1036
00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:47.950
<v Speaker 1>he didn't say no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not gonna let you in.</v>

1037
00:49:48.310 --> 00:49:50.140
<v Speaker 1>He put enough doubt in my mind and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1038
00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:53.950
<v Speaker 1>I got to do more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was broken.</v>

1039
00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:56.920
<v Speaker 1>I was broken bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>

1040
00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:58.900
<v Speaker 1>how long did it take you to recover </v>
<v Speaker 1>physically?</v>

1041
00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:04.200
<v Speaker 1>The funniest thing about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tell a story very often I'd signed up </v>

1042
00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:05.020
<v Speaker 1>for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting to that answer is right now.</v>

1043
00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:08.050
<v Speaker 1>I went into employment and me and my </v>
<v Speaker 1>wife,</v>

1044
00:50:08.051 --> 00:50:13.051
<v Speaker 1>my mom signed up for the first Los Vegas</v>
<v Speaker 1>marathon down the Strip of Las Vegas and</v>

1045
00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:15.370
<v Speaker 1>that incident happened.</v>

1046
00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:20.170
<v Speaker 1>So I ran a hundred miles before I ran a </v>
<v Speaker 1>marathon.</v>

1047
00:50:21.130 --> 00:50:25.510
<v Speaker 1>Two weeks later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly December fifth was this marathon</v>

1048
00:50:25.511 --> 00:50:27.440
<v Speaker 1>that we all signed up for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't walk.</v>

1049
00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:30.800
<v Speaker 1>I could not walk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was fucked up.</v>

1050
00:50:31.370 --> 00:50:35.930
<v Speaker 1>So 10 days or two weeks after this 100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>mile in one race,</v>

1051
00:50:35.931 --> 00:50:38.810
<v Speaker 1>I did um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this marathon,</v>

1052
00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:40.850
<v Speaker 1>December fifth in Las Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1053
00:50:40.870 --> 00:50:42.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the first one I can't run.</v>

1054
00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:48.190
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I can walk with my mom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I try to go out to this little knoll </v>

1055
00:50:48.190 --> 00:50:48.960
<v Speaker 1>around our grassy area in San Diego.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Try.</v>

1056
00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:50.990
<v Speaker 1>I tried to run laser broken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1057
00:50:50.991 --> 00:50:51.740
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't even.</v>

1058
00:50:51.930 --> 00:50:54.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm jacked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't do shit.</v>

1059
00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:55.880
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

1060
00:50:55.881 --> 00:51:00.881
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'll watch you guys do the </v>
<v Speaker 1>marathon and I'll cheer you guys on </v>

1061
00:51:00.881 --> 00:51:00.881
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1062
00:51:00.881 --> 00:51:03.260
<v Speaker 1>I'll try to walk with my mom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>December fifth happened.</v>

1063
00:51:04.070 --> 00:51:09.070
<v Speaker 1>That gun went off 2005,</v>
<v Speaker 1>14 days after I broke myself off and I </v>

1064
00:51:10.911 --> 00:51:12.830
<v Speaker 1>qualified for the Boston Marathon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ran a three.</v>

1065
00:51:12.831 --> 00:51:13.160
<v Speaker 1>Oh eight.</v>

1066
00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:21.280
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's funny about it know people </v>

1067
00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:23.570
<v Speaker 1>hearsay's motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even when I tell you the story I </v>

1068
00:51:23.570 --> 00:51:24.230
<v Speaker 1>dropped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to drop so many names.</v>

1069
00:51:24.290 --> 00:51:25.460
<v Speaker 1>Google it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look it up.</v>

1070
00:51:25.461 --> 00:51:27.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like elmo.</v>

1071
00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:30.890
<v Speaker 1>Seems like I'm making my own story up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>

1072
00:51:30.891 --> 00:51:32.650
<v Speaker 1>It almost seems like a to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>

1073
00:51:32.810 --> 00:51:37.810
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when I tell if I were to hear </v>

1074
00:51:37.810 --> 00:51:37.810
<v Speaker 1>somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

1075
00:51:37.810 --> 00:51:38.060
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you listen to Joe Rogan's podcast.</v>

1076
00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:41.700
<v Speaker 1>I heard some black dude from fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>Brazilian and talking about uh,</v>

1077
00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:43.490
<v Speaker 1>this happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this happened three weeks.</v>

1078
00:51:43.491 --> 00:51:45.890
<v Speaker 1>Ranger school ran a hundred miles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>broke my feet,</v>

1079
00:51:45.891 --> 00:51:50.891
<v Speaker 1>brought my body about this is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>biggest fucking liar on the planet or </v>

1080
00:51:50.891 --> 00:51:51.110
<v Speaker 1>ain't nobody doing shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

1081
00:51:51.111 --> 00:51:55.190
<v Speaker 1>even when I tell my story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it almost sounds like some made up shit.</v>

1082
00:51:55.191 --> 00:52:00.191
<v Speaker 1>So you got crazies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ran a hundred miles before you ever </v>

1083
00:52:00.191 --> 00:52:00.191
<v Speaker 1>ran a marathon.</v>

1084
00:52:00.191 --> 00:52:04.510
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you didn't run again at all and </v>

1085
00:52:04.510 --> 00:52:04.510
<v Speaker 1>he's still qualified for the Boston </v>
<v Speaker 1>Marathon.</v>

1086
00:52:04.510 --> 00:52:05.810
<v Speaker 1>So you ran a three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1087
00:52:05.811 --> 00:52:06.650
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1088
00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:11.740
<v Speaker 1>For the first marathon you ever did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever did two weeks after you ran 100 </v>

1089
00:52:11.740 --> 00:52:13.430
<v Speaker 1>miles with no training and nothing in </v>
<v Speaker 1>between,</v>

1090
00:52:13.431 --> 00:52:18.431
<v Speaker 1>but it gets better than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see my training log that </v>

1091
00:52:18.431 --> 00:52:21.881
<v Speaker 1>actually posted up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's when I started training for </v>

1092
00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:27.700
<v Speaker 1>the hurt 100.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So basically what happened was after </v>

1093
00:52:27.700 --> 00:52:31.421
<v Speaker 1>that I had about four weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it feel like to run that </v>

1094
00:52:31.421 --> 00:52:31.421
<v Speaker 1>three?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh eight.</v>

1095
00:52:31.421 --> 00:52:35.441
<v Speaker 1>If you could barely walk when that gun </v>
<v Speaker 1>went off something off in my head and I </v>

1096
00:52:37.551 --> 00:52:40.460
<v Speaker 1>didn't feel that much pain at all </v>
<v Speaker 1>afterwards.</v>

1097
00:52:40.461 --> 00:52:43.610
<v Speaker 1>I did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but something happened where I was like,</v>

1098
00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:46.970
<v Speaker 1>the gun went off and that thing came </v>
<v Speaker 1>back like,</v>

1099
00:52:46.971 --> 00:52:49.310
<v Speaker 1>all right man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if.</v>

1100
00:52:49.870 --> 00:52:53.450
<v Speaker 1>Because I wanted to qualify for Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was my goal,</v>

1101
00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:55.460
<v Speaker 1>but I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was jacked up,</v>

1102
00:52:55.940 --> 00:52:56.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

1103
00:52:56.841 --> 00:53:01.841
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I didn't run as much as I should </v>

1104
00:53:01.841 --> 00:53:01.910
<v Speaker 1>have had all over my Iraq training.</v>

1105
00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:07.150
<v Speaker 1>I hit the weights and but my job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my goal was when I signed up for it </v>

1106
00:53:07.150 --> 00:53:08.930
<v Speaker 1>a year early,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to qualify for Boston,</v>

1107
00:53:08.931 --> 00:53:09.700
<v Speaker 1>which was a three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10,</v>

1108
00:53:09.730 --> 00:53:14.210
<v Speaker 1>59 and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if you can qualify for Boston,</v>

1109
00:53:14.211 --> 00:53:16.340
<v Speaker 1>maybe just reading so we will help me </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

1110
00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:21.140
<v Speaker 1>I spent 101 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is 26 miles to me now?</v>

1111
00:53:21.890 --> 00:53:26.890
<v Speaker 1>So the mindset going into it was like I </v>
<v Speaker 1>ran 75 more miles in this so I use it to</v>

1112
00:53:28.561 --> 00:53:33.561
<v Speaker 1>my advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So after that happened I ran a feet </v>

1113
00:53:33.561 --> 00:53:37.131
<v Speaker 1>pretty much broken out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will go to the physical therapist and </v>

1114
00:53:37.131 --> 00:53:40.551
<v Speaker 1>they had this compression tape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>compression tape help because my feet </v>

1115
00:53:40.551 --> 00:53:42.720
<v Speaker 1>were pretty bad off and I would run 70,</v>
<v Speaker 1>8,000</v>

1116
00:53:42.721 --> 00:53:46.560
<v Speaker 1>mile weeks and then I went to the hurt </v>
<v Speaker 1>100 race in Hawaii.</v>

1117
00:53:47.130 --> 00:53:49.650
<v Speaker 1>Twenty 6,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>feet of climbing over 100 miles.</v>

1118
00:53:50.250 --> 00:53:52.920
<v Speaker 1>Probably one of the top five hardest </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred mile races in the world.</v>

1119
00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:56.130
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't even have a real runner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1120
00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:59.670
<v Speaker 1>I baked a lot of miles by the last,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last two and a half.</v>

1121
00:53:59.671 --> 00:54:04.290
<v Speaker 1>About two months that wasn't a runner </v>
<v Speaker 1>with out there and got through the race,</v>

1122
00:54:04.380 --> 00:54:06.690
<v Speaker 1>didn't 33 hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the ninth place finisher.</v>

1123
00:54:07.110 --> 00:54:12.110
<v Speaker 1>Not many people finished that that year </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I qualify for badwater and got in </v>

1124
00:54:12.110 --> 00:54:17.090
<v Speaker 1>and I went on to lose weight and train </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard and I got fifth my first year and </v>

1125
00:54:17.090 --> 00:54:19.020
<v Speaker 1>went back my second year and got third.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you see you,</v>

1126
00:54:19.021 --> 00:54:21.660
<v Speaker 1>when you lost weight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what will you eventually when?</v>

1127
00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:27.500
<v Speaker 1>So I went to the race about one 97,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lost quite a bit from the bodybuilding </v>

1128
00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:29.100
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's over a short period of time,</v>

1129
00:54:29.130 --> 00:54:30.510
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did you lose all that way?</v>

1130
00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:33.090
<v Speaker 1>Once again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just worked out hard.</v>

1131
00:54:33.150 --> 00:54:35.490
<v Speaker 1>I stopped taking my protein so much.</v>

1132
00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:37.350
<v Speaker 1>I got off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was on this stuff,</v>

1133
00:54:37.351 --> 00:54:41.580
<v Speaker 1>caught a nitrile tech and I got all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>protein stuff.</v>

1134
00:54:41.581 --> 00:54:44.610
<v Speaker 1>I just started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started hitting the weight so hard and</v>

1135
00:54:44.611 --> 00:54:49.470
<v Speaker 1>I just became a running fool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Became the black forest gump man.</v>

1136
00:54:49.471 --> 00:54:51.150
<v Speaker 1>Pretty much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty simple,</v>

1137
00:54:51.151 --> 00:54:52.050
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what happened.</v>

1138
00:54:52.290 --> 00:54:57.290
<v Speaker 1>Now when you say you were using </v>
<v Speaker 1>compression tape on your feet and your </v>

1139
00:54:57.290 --> 00:54:57.720
<v Speaker 1>feet with Jack Dot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was the extent of the injuries?</v>

1140
00:54:58.050 --> 00:55:02.710
<v Speaker 1>So basically because of my pronation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never figured out because my muscles,</v>

1141
00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:08.510
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always had issues with stress </v>

1142
00:55:08.510 --> 00:55:08.510
<v Speaker 1>fractures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shin splints.</v>

1143
00:55:08.510 --> 00:55:10.560
<v Speaker 1>So I put a lot of pressure on the inside</v>
<v Speaker 1>of my ankles.</v>

1144
00:55:11.070 --> 00:55:15.150
<v Speaker 1>And so that there's a tendon that goes </v>
<v Speaker 1>up the backside of your,</v>

1145
00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:19.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's just your fibia a </v>
<v Speaker 1>backside that,</v>

1146
00:55:19.530 --> 00:55:24.530
<v Speaker 1>that little bone back side of your foot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It goes right up beside of that law </v>

1147
00:55:24.530 --> 00:55:24.530
<v Speaker 1>rather than inside that bone.</v>

1148
00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:29.600
<v Speaker 1>And that thing was just so fluid up on </v>
<v Speaker 1>both sides that even this flexing,</v>

1149
00:55:30.001 --> 00:55:33.390
<v Speaker 1>my foot was just killing me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I realized when you can,</v>

1150
00:55:33.810 --> 00:55:36.150
<v Speaker 1>when you cast that thing up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kathy,</v>

1151
00:55:36.151 --> 00:55:38.200
<v Speaker 1>my feet always helped me out because it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1152
00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:41.730
<v Speaker 1>it locked my foot into position that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would've made me protonate as much.</v>

1153
00:55:42.210 --> 00:55:44.180
<v Speaker 1>So between the caffeine of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if,</v>

1154
00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:49.200
<v Speaker 1>if he wants the badwater video of 2006,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll see me crossing the finish line </v>

1155
00:55:49.231 --> 00:55:54.231
<v Speaker 1>with this compression tape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Literally like flying on my ankles </v>

1156
00:55:54.231 --> 00:55:58.851
<v Speaker 1>because I went to the race with </v>
<v Speaker 1>compression tape on my ankles and so </v>

1157
00:55:58.851 --> 00:56:01.350
<v Speaker 1>basically I'd have that on my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on my ankles.</v>

1158
00:56:01.710 --> 00:56:06.710
<v Speaker 1>I had inserts in my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my shoes and also this wedge on the </v>

1159
00:56:06.751 --> 00:56:11.751
<v Speaker 1>back heel of my left foot so then it </v>
<v Speaker 1>would keep me from eating that heal so </v>

1160
00:56:11.751 --> 00:56:15.771
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I had all that on just to go run and </v>

1161
00:56:15.771 --> 00:56:19.250
<v Speaker 1>I ran my ass off and went to badwater </v>
<v Speaker 1>2006 and with a compression tape on my </v>

1162
00:56:21.030 --> 00:56:23.170
<v Speaker 1>feet and walked a lot.</v>

1163
00:56:23.740 --> 00:56:28.740
<v Speaker 1>But I got third place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you always run with regular running </v>

1164
00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:28.740
<v Speaker 1>shoes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do,</v>

1165
00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:32.310
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now I don't have those issues </v>

1166
00:56:32.310 --> 00:56:33.931
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All this stretching has opened my body </v>

1167
00:56:33.931 --> 00:56:33.931
<v Speaker 1>up to where you know how it should've </v>
<v Speaker 1>been.</v>

1168
00:56:33.931 --> 00:56:36.040
<v Speaker 1>So my alignment is pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not perfect.</v>

1169
00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:38.370
<v Speaker 1>So now I just run a regular running </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoes now.</v>

1170
00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:40.540
<v Speaker 1>Now no more compression tape number and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff.</v>

1171
00:56:40.750 --> 00:56:42.190
<v Speaker 1>So if you see now if you look down </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

1172
00:56:42.191 --> 00:56:47.191
<v Speaker 1>you'll see the compressed it and you'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>see my ex wife here in a second taking </v>

1173
00:56:47.191 --> 00:56:52.060
<v Speaker 1>their can present tape off of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's doing it right now to see her </v>

1174
00:56:52.060 --> 00:56:52.270
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said tape,</v>

1175
00:56:52.490 --> 00:56:54.100
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the tape right there.</v>

1176
00:56:54.101 --> 00:56:55.930
<v Speaker 1>It had to wear everyday of my life to </v>
<v Speaker 1>run.</v>

1177
00:56:56.740 --> 00:57:00.160
<v Speaker 1>So as you see this story may be kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievable,</v>

1178
00:57:00.190 --> 00:57:01.750
<v Speaker 1>but there some proof right there.</v>

1179
00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:05.110
<v Speaker 1>So that's how it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So painful.</v>

1180
00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:10.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was pretty fucked up as you see right </v>

1181
00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:10.160
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to get all mad.</v>

1182
00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:10.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1183
00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:14.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty destroyed right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the most amount of miles you've </v>

1184
00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:15.540
<v Speaker 1>ever run at one time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1185

<v Speaker 1>quite a few people now over the last </v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1191

<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

00:57:34.450 --> 00:57:35.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:38.950

<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>

1194
00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:41.210
<v Speaker 1>Some crazy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was first place winner.</v>

1195
00:57:41.211 --> 00:57:43.300
<v Speaker 1>She beat everybody else a second place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One road.</v>

<v Speaker 1>There's no other people to everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that,</v>

1208
00:58:12.100 --> 00:58:14.770
<v Speaker 1>that can do that as a demon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of us don't want to admit to shit.</v>

1209
00:58:14.890 --> 00:58:16.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got them.</v>

1210
00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:17.980
<v Speaker 1>Oh 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to be.</v>

1211
00:58:18.790 --> 00:58:23.790
<v Speaker 1>So when you do this and you qualify and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1212
00:58:24.361 --> 00:58:26.320
<v Speaker 1>you do that race in Hawaii,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1213
00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:28.840
<v Speaker 1>They just let you in after that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1214
00:58:28.841 --> 00:58:30.660
<v Speaker 1>So the race in Hawaii?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1215
00:58:30.661 --> 00:58:33.760
<v Speaker 1>I actually called the race director up </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there wasn't like a big time.</v>

1216
00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:35.990
<v Speaker 1>Like I didn't have 100 mile race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it's.</v>

1217
00:58:35.991 --> 00:58:40.991
<v Speaker 1>I had and see the 100 mile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You did the Boston marathon or you did </v>

1218
00:58:40.991 --> 00:58:42.310
<v Speaker 1>the Vegas Marathon?</v>

1219
00:58:42.390 --> 00:58:43.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I did a hundred miles.</v>

1220
00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:46.990
<v Speaker 1>100 more miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Vegas Marathon with the hurt 100.</v>

1221
00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:50.560
<v Speaker 1>Did that hundred miler and all this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a very short amount of time.</v>

1222
00:58:50.561 --> 00:58:52.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So November was the first 100 miler.</v>

1223
00:58:53.140 --> 00:58:58.140
<v Speaker 1>December was the 26 miles in Las Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>January was the next hundred miler in </v>

1224
00:59:00.141 --> 00:59:00.720
<v Speaker 1>Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1225
00:59:00.730 --> 00:59:05.730
<v Speaker 1>fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is like say if I was your friend </v>

1226
00:59:05.730 --> 00:59:05.730
<v Speaker 1>and I called you up on October 20th.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

<v Speaker 1>how many times do you run?</v>

1228
00:59:06.460 --> 00:59:09.370

<v Speaker 1>I know if you can pull it up or not,</v>

1229
00:59:09.371 --> 00:59:11.530
<v Speaker 1>but if you could pull up my race </v>
<v Speaker 1>schedule for 2007,</v>

1230
00:59:11.531 --> 00:59:14.850
<v Speaker 1>just pull up David Goggins race results.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see something real crazy.</v>

1231
00:59:14.851 --> 00:59:19.150
<v Speaker 1>And second they say this is good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta show you proof because why?</v>

1232
00:59:19.780 --> 00:59:22.290
<v Speaker 1>I know my story doesn't make any but </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1233
00:59:22.310 --> 00:59:27.310
<v Speaker 1>Look at the dates of these races and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to show it to you in a </v>

1234
00:59:27.310 --> 00:59:27.310
<v Speaker 1>second.</v>

1235
00:59:27.310 --> 00:59:29.120
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just look at the hundred miles.</v>

1236
00:59:29.170 --> 00:59:34.170
<v Speaker 1>Fifty miles back to back weekends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many weekends there were between </v>

1237
00:59:34.170 --> 00:59:34.640
<v Speaker 1>races.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you look right here,</v>

1238
00:59:34.670 --> 00:59:37.070
<v Speaker 1>you can't really see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we've looked at 2007.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It was a month after I did that 100 </v>

1253
01:00:12.790 --> 01:00:13.360
<v Speaker 1>miler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred 35.</v>

1254
01:00:13.370 --> 01:00:17.210
<v Speaker 1>Our leadville was less than a month </v>
<v Speaker 1>after badwater.</v>

1255
01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:20.900
<v Speaker 1>They're playing 100 was three weeks </v>
<v Speaker 1>after leadville.</v>

1256
01:00:21.470 --> 01:00:26.470
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Angel's crest was to attend date a week </v>

1257
01:00:26.470 --> 01:00:28.970
<v Speaker 1>after that 100 miler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bear 100 was a what?</v>

1258
01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:34.000
<v Speaker 1>Thirteen days after that 100 milers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She and then I ran the 200 and it said </v>

1259
01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.850
<v Speaker 1>two and three point five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't ran towards his tour and </v>

1260
01:00:38.850 --> 01:00:41.521
<v Speaker 1>five miles around there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what's not in there was that </v>

1261
01:00:41.521 --> 01:00:43.730
<v Speaker 1>mcnaughton race I did in 2,850</v>
<v Speaker 1>mile race.</v>

1262
01:00:44.330 --> 01:00:49.330
<v Speaker 1>Also did in 2007 that wasn't listed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was just my 2007 year.</v>

1263
01:00:50.270 --> 01:00:51.410
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1264
01:00:51.411 --> 01:00:53.810
<v Speaker 1>So do you think that is what fucked your</v>
<v Speaker 1>body up?</v>

1265
01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:54.860
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1266
01:00:54.950 --> 01:00:59.950
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I still run the same mileage </v>

1267
01:00:59.950 --> 01:00:59.960
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're fucked my body up as hell week.</v>

1268
01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:01.580
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1269
01:01:01.730 --> 01:01:03.380
<v Speaker 1>You don't go through three hell weeks in</v>
<v Speaker 1>one year.</v>

1270
01:01:03.670 --> 01:01:08.670
<v Speaker 1>So I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what happened was when I realized </v>

1271
01:01:08.670 --> 01:01:08.670
<v Speaker 1>that my body was really jacked up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I went,</v>

1272
01:01:08.670 --> 01:01:10.520
<v Speaker 1>I was a big time squatter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>love squatting,</v>

1273
01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:14.630
<v Speaker 1>and I went through the first hell week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got messed up.</v>

1275
01:01:16.130 --> 01:01:17.270
<v Speaker 1>Then third,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hope we could get all the way through.</v>

1276
01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:22.280
<v Speaker 1>And my third hell week we hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had a guy die on Thursday and then </v>

1277
01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:23.900
<v Speaker 1>that whole weekend and I graduated 100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>done pulmonary edema.</v>

1278
01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:29.000
<v Speaker 1>It was a code name was John Scopp Code </v>
<v Speaker 1>is fuck hell week.</v>

1279
01:01:30.260 --> 01:01:33.650
<v Speaker 1>The Pacific Ocean's never warm and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>rained the whole time.</v>

1280
01:01:34.070 --> 01:01:35.740
<v Speaker 1>The whole time was rain and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1281
01:01:36.140 --> 01:01:37.890
<v Speaker 1>pretty much just drown in his own </v>
<v Speaker 1>fluids.</v>

1282
01:01:37.910 --> 01:01:42.910
<v Speaker 1>Pretty much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were in the pool doing some </v>

1283
01:01:42.910 --> 01:01:42.910
<v Speaker 1>evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He sunk to the bottom,</v>

1284
01:01:42.910 --> 01:01:43.460
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his temperature was hot.</v>

1285
01:01:43.461 --> 01:01:45.710
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he missed a lot of hell week for getting</v>

1286
01:01:45.711 --> 01:01:48.710
<v Speaker 1>pulled out for different stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wouldn't quit and um,</v>

1287
01:01:48.711 --> 01:01:50.390
<v Speaker 1>he ended up dying and he'll wait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

1288
01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:51.770
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so anyway,</v>

1289
01:01:52.490 --> 01:01:54.370
<v Speaker 1>after hell week ended,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1290
01:01:54.740 --> 01:01:56.470
<v Speaker 1>I want to go back to the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1291
01:01:56.490 --> 01:01:58.160
<v Speaker 1>second phase happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>die phase,</v>

1292
01:01:58.161 --> 01:01:59.960
<v Speaker 1>like I could get back in the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 1>start jacking my weight.</v>

1293
01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:03.260
<v Speaker 1>I Love Jack and wait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I realized I couldn't squat.</v>

1294
01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:07.310
<v Speaker 1>So I went from squatting a lot too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't even squat the bar because my</v>

1295
01:02:07.311 --> 01:02:08.910
<v Speaker 1>lower back was all fucked up and I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1296
01:02:08.911 --> 01:02:13.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was because there's this muscle so it</v>

1297
01:02:13.311 --> 01:02:18.311
<v Speaker 1>hell week your hip flexors are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I went through so many of them so </v>

1298
01:02:18.311 --> 01:02:21.780
<v Speaker 1>fast and so the hardest part of buds I </v>
<v Speaker 1>went through three times,</v>

1299
01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:23.010
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the hell week part,</v>

1300
01:02:23.860 --> 01:02:26.880
<v Speaker 1>one of the hardest parts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was the initial part of the where</v>

1301
01:02:26.890 --> 01:02:30.300
<v Speaker 1>everybody sees on tv,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the log pt to Surf,</v>

1302
01:02:30.330 --> 01:02:33.110
<v Speaker 1>torture the Dag on boats over your head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>law,</v>

1303
01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:38.180
<v Speaker 1>all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went through that person three times </v>

1304
01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:40.080
<v Speaker 1>in one year and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over a period of time my hip flexors got</v>

1305
01:02:40.081 --> 01:02:45.081
<v Speaker 1>so tight that is jack me up a jack me up</v>
<v Speaker 1>from my hip flexors,</v>

1306
01:02:45.450 --> 01:02:50.450
<v Speaker 1>so always been so cold and so stressed </v>
<v Speaker 1>out and everything led up to it.</v>

1307
01:02:50.790 --> 01:02:55.790
<v Speaker 1>But this really was the part that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>noticed I could squat before hell week </v>

1308
01:02:55.790 --> 01:02:57.990
<v Speaker 1>or before my first time going to bud's </v>
<v Speaker 1>after,</v>

1309
01:02:58.110 --> 01:03:00.540
<v Speaker 1>after Bud's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't,</v>

1310
01:03:00.690 --> 01:03:05.690
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't squat anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you just think it might just be </v>

1311
01:03:05.690 --> 01:03:06.270
<v Speaker 1>because your body was exhausted?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1312
01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:08.160
<v Speaker 1>because I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I for 12 years,</v>

1313
01:03:08.161 --> 01:03:10.510
<v Speaker 1>so I would go back and tough it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1314
01:03:10.630 --> 01:03:11.970
<v Speaker 1>like with Joe Burns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was squatting.</v>

1315
01:03:11.971 --> 01:03:12.510
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

1316
01:03:12.511 --> 01:03:16.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to squat with Joe Burns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just couldn't squat because that,</v>

1317
01:03:16.450 --> 01:03:19.410
<v Speaker 1>that muscle was attached to your t 12.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what was it doing to.</v>

1318
01:03:19.411 --> 01:03:20.480
<v Speaker 1>Is it locking up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was,</v>

1319
01:03:20.481 --> 01:03:25.481
<v Speaker 1>this is just pulling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it made my hips feel like I couldn't </v>

1320
01:03:25.481 --> 01:03:26.270
<v Speaker 1>sync my ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't think.</v>

1321
01:03:26.271 --> 01:03:27.870
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's incredible pain.</v>

1322
01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:32.370
<v Speaker 1>And then with the weight pushing me down</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then try to push up,</v>

1323
01:03:32.850 --> 01:03:34.740
<v Speaker 1>the pain was just too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was,</v>

1324
01:03:34.741 --> 01:03:36.110
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is all range of motion.</v>

1325
01:03:36.390 --> 01:03:37.590
<v Speaker 1>Range of motion issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1326
01:03:37.650 --> 01:03:39.780
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an important thing for my friend.</v>

1327
01:03:39.781 --> 01:03:41.220
<v Speaker 1>Cam Haynes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who doesn't stretch?</v>

1328
01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:44.790
<v Speaker 1>He's another friend of mine who runs </v>
<v Speaker 1>ultra races.</v>

1329
01:03:44.791 --> 01:03:48.780
<v Speaker 1>He ran that Moab to 40.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's run the big foot two.</v>

1330
01:03:48.781 --> 01:03:50.220
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five is when a few of those.</v>

1331
01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:51.260
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1332
01:03:51.390 --> 01:03:53.370
<v Speaker 1>I know he's listening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go stretch dude.</v>

1333
01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:54.610
<v Speaker 1>He has support,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1334
01:03:54.611 --> 01:03:56.490
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you're working that hard,</v>

1335
01:03:56.491 --> 01:03:57.960
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're doing that much.</v>

1336
01:03:57.961 --> 01:03:58.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

1337
01:03:58.621 --> 01:04:00.960
<v Speaker 1>you're definitely locking up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could barely touch his toes.</v>

1338
01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:02.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not a good thing.</v>

1339
01:04:02.130 --> 01:04:03.030
<v Speaker 1>That's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1340
01:04:03.170 --> 01:04:03.670
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1341
01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:05.310
<v Speaker 1>It comes back to her chin inside pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>soon.</v>

1342
01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:06.570
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How flexible you now,</v>

1343
01:04:06.571 --> 01:04:11.571
<v Speaker 1>because I would imagine you probably a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking ballerina at this point because </v>

1344
01:04:11.571 --> 01:04:12.420
<v Speaker 1>it's sad when your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to get there.</v>

1345
01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:17.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to get there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I stretch every night for these two </v>

1346
01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:19.881
<v Speaker 1>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the thing that people said that </v>

1347
01:04:19.881 --> 01:04:19.881
<v Speaker 1>it'll always pissed me off because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty flexible.</v>

1348
01:04:19.881 --> 01:04:20.080
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1349
01:04:20.081 --> 01:04:21.330
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're naturally flexible.</v>

1350
01:04:21.331 --> 01:04:22.800
<v Speaker 1>People have a natural threshold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1351
01:04:23.250 --> 01:04:24.090
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't.</v>

1352
01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:25.650
<v Speaker 1>Like a doctor told me that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1353
01:04:25.651 --> 01:04:26.730
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

1354
01:04:26.910 --> 01:04:28.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what you're talking about</v>

1355
01:04:28.141 --> 01:04:30.190
<v Speaker 1>because most people don't push </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves past that pain,</v>

1356
01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:31.930
<v Speaker 1>that stretch pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1357
01:04:31.950 --> 01:04:34.170
<v Speaker 1>People want to put a title on your man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's easier for them.</v>

1358
01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:36.360
<v Speaker 1>Just fucking natural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Natural.</v>

1359
01:04:36.361 --> 01:04:38.130
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you don't work hard enough,</v>

1360
01:04:38.131 --> 01:04:39.420
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1361
01:04:39.610 --> 01:04:41.670
<v Speaker 1>People don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Champs aren't usually flexible.</v>

1362
01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.160
<v Speaker 1>You have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to force yourself to do this.</v>

1363
01:04:44.170 --> 01:04:45.330
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1364
01:04:45.331 --> 01:04:47.820
<v Speaker 1>I know it because I had a friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friend tom or dog now,</v>

1365
01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:49.320
<v Speaker 1>he was a football player,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jack,</v>

1366
01:04:49.321 --> 01:04:54.321
<v Speaker 1>big thick dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Terrible flexibility was taking </v>

1367
01:04:54.321 --> 01:04:54.750
<v Speaker 1>taekwondo with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And over the course of a couple of years</v>

1368
01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:57.690
<v Speaker 1>I saw that dude eventually develop a </v>
<v Speaker 1>full split and you go.</v>

1369
01:04:57.720 --> 01:04:59.610
<v Speaker 1>And he just did it through his mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just was.</v>

1370
01:04:59.611 --> 01:05:04.611
<v Speaker 1>Everybody else was done training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy would be on the mat constantly </v>

1371
01:05:04.611 --> 01:05:07.971
<v Speaker 1>stretch and always working out because </v>
<v Speaker 1>he had built his body up so strong all </v>

1372
01:05:07.971 --> 01:05:10.580
<v Speaker 1>those years of squatting and lifting </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he just,</v>

1373
01:05:10.830 --> 01:05:12.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was all tents and everything was just</v>

1374
01:05:12.631 --> 01:05:14.430
<v Speaker 1>like this super powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1375
01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:16.500
<v Speaker 1>But all like very tense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I stopped.</v>

1376
01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:18.160
<v Speaker 1>That's what I never stretched</v>

1377
01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:19.770
<v Speaker 2>because I wanted to strength.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1378
01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:21.070
<v Speaker 2>You weren't that tight muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

1379
01:05:21.071 --> 01:05:22.720
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it stupid.</v>

1380
01:05:22.820 --> 01:05:27.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're not supposed to stretch </v>

1381
01:05:27.820 --> 01:05:29.731
<v Speaker 2>before you do big physical activities </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I think it does like we can use </v>

1382
01:05:29.731 --> 01:05:31.810
<v Speaker 2>somewhat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think being flexible overall</v>

1383
01:05:31.811 --> 01:05:34.420
<v Speaker 2>makes you weak or not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not at all.</v>

1384
01:05:34.470 --> 01:05:36.010
<v Speaker 2>What certainly doesn't from martial </v>
<v Speaker 2>arts,</v>

1385
01:05:36.011 --> 01:05:39.730
<v Speaker 2>because you need that flexibility to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have leg dexterity to be able to kick.</v>

1386
01:05:40.260 --> 01:05:45.260
<v Speaker 2>It's got to be fluid where it's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>tightened up by restriction of the </v>

1387
01:05:45.260 --> 01:05:45.460
<v Speaker 2>motion of your body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

1388
01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:47.410
<v Speaker 2>It's truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think people are,</v>

1389
01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:49.150
<v Speaker 2>for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and A.</v>

1390
01:05:49.390 --> 01:05:52.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I drone on too much about yoga.</v>

1391
01:05:52.751 --> 01:05:55.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm like one of those vegans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you gotta do it man.</v>

1392
01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:58.720
<v Speaker 2>I get annoying like a born again </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christian or something.</v>

1393
01:05:58.860 --> 01:06:00.520
<v Speaker 2>It's like I'm getting that way now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1394
01:06:00.970 --> 01:06:03.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting that way now for anybody who</v>
<v Speaker 2>does anything to hard.</v>

1395
01:06:03.671 --> 01:06:08.671
<v Speaker 2>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you do anything like with weight </v>

1396
01:06:08.671 --> 01:06:12.350
<v Speaker 2>lifting type shit or martial arts type </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit where it's just everything's </v>

1397
01:06:12.350 --> 01:06:13.270
<v Speaker 2>explosion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's lifting,</v>

1398
01:06:13.271 --> 01:06:14.440
<v Speaker 2>it's heavy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's push,</v>

1399
01:06:14.441 --> 01:06:19.441
<v Speaker 2>push,</v>
<v Speaker 2>push yoga to balance your shit out and </v>

1400
01:06:19.441 --> 01:06:19.441
<v Speaker 2>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1401
01:06:19.441 --> 01:06:24.191
<v Speaker 2>we'll really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well man and this all these people that </v>

1402
01:06:24.191 --> 01:06:26.041
<v Speaker 2>resist it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there was some article recently </v>

1403
01:06:26.041 --> 01:06:27.700
<v Speaker 2>that was something along the lines of </v>
<v Speaker 2>hot yoga is just trendy nonsense.</v>

1404
01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:31.960
<v Speaker 2>I read that and then even in the article</v>
<v Speaker 2>it talked about that there might be some</v>

1405
01:06:31.961 --> 01:06:36.961
<v Speaker 2>benefits in terms of like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>strengthening your arteries and they </v>

1406
01:06:36.961 --> 01:06:39.250
<v Speaker 2>didn't even mention heat shock proteins </v>
<v Speaker 2>is a study going on right now.</v>

1407
01:06:39.251 --> 01:06:44.251
<v Speaker 2>I believe it's at Harvard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of my friends was telling me about </v>

1408
01:06:44.251 --> 01:06:47.611
<v Speaker 2>it where they're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to find the benefits of </v>

1409
01:06:47.611 --> 01:06:50.491
<v Speaker 2>90 minute hot yoga classes because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>think it might mirror the observed </v>

1410
01:06:50.491 --> 01:06:54.991
<v Speaker 2>benefits of sauna which they already </v>
<v Speaker 2>know for a fact has big benefits because</v>

1411
01:06:55.541 --> 01:06:57.760
<v Speaker 2>of your body producing heat shock </v>
<v Speaker 2>proteins.</v>

1412
01:06:57.760 --> 01:06:59.980
<v Speaker 2>To deal with the heat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I put that song in here,</v>

1413
01:06:59.981 --> 01:07:01.570
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go in that fuck her all the time,</v>

1414
01:07:01.571 --> 01:07:03.910
<v Speaker 2>but no one can tell me it doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's big.</v>

1415
01:07:03.970 --> 01:07:05.620
<v Speaker 2>It's proof positive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That changed my life.</v>

1416
01:07:05.740 --> 01:07:08.020
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't a medication or this or </v>
<v Speaker 2>address.</v>

1417
01:07:08.050 --> 01:07:09.490
<v Speaker 2>It was stretching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1418
01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:10.510
<v Speaker 2>it was yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stretching.</v>

1419
01:07:10.511 --> 01:07:15.511
<v Speaker 2>All that stuff combined changed it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just think it balances out your </v>

1420
01:07:15.511 --> 01:07:18.811
<v Speaker 2>body in those static poses where you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>just holding the pose and it just works </v>

1421
01:07:20.111 --> 01:07:22.060
<v Speaker 2>you out in a weird way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They to percent.</v>

1422
01:07:22.090 --> 01:07:25.330
<v Speaker 2>You just don't get lifting weights or </v>
<v Speaker 2>hitting the bag or anything.</v>

1423
01:07:25.410 --> 01:07:27.460
<v Speaker 2>You're just not going to get that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That kind of working out.</v>

1424
01:07:27.490 --> 01:07:29.500
<v Speaker 2>I can't agree with you more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so difficult.</v>

1425
01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:31.220
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get your ass off.</v>

1426
01:07:31.230 --> 01:07:33.790
<v Speaker 2>You're enjoying housewives and shit and </v>
<v Speaker 2>be like,</v>

1427
01:07:33.820 --> 01:07:36.140
<v Speaker 2>this is like the silent struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's humbling it.</v>

1428
01:07:36.140 --> 01:07:39.610
<v Speaker 2>Nobody knows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you see like two doorways,</v>

1429
01:07:39.611 --> 01:07:44.611
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of them is like fucking ct Ali </v>

1430
01:07:44.611 --> 01:07:47.290
<v Speaker 2>Fletcher's fucking super pumped iron </v>
<v Speaker 2>addicts gym,</v>

1431
01:07:47.530 --> 01:07:51.250
<v Speaker 2>which is hard work and then right next </v>
<v Speaker 2>to it is the yoga studio.</v>

1432
01:07:51.251 --> 01:07:51.910
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1433
01:07:52.150 --> 01:07:54.460
<v Speaker 2>once you get done with all that hard </v>
<v Speaker 2>work,</v>

1434
01:07:54.461 --> 01:07:56.570
<v Speaker 2>you'll go over to that yoga studio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1435
01:07:56.590 --> 01:07:58.690
<v Speaker 2>there's two different kinds of hard work</v>
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>

1436
01:07:58.750 --> 01:08:00.820
<v Speaker 2>It's no joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two different kinds of hard work.</v>

1437
01:08:00.910 --> 01:08:05.910
<v Speaker 2>Yes sir.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what do you do now in terms of like </v>

1438
01:08:05.910 --> 01:08:09.331
<v Speaker 2>you got over this five years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in this bad situation where your </v>

1439
01:08:09.331 --> 01:08:11.410
<v Speaker 2>body's not working right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything's working great again.</v>

1440
01:08:11.690 --> 01:08:13.840
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had two heart surgeries also.</v>

1441
01:08:13.900 --> 01:08:15.890
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1442
01:08:16.670 --> 01:08:20.120
<v Speaker 1>your heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I had a hole in it so you know,</v>

1443
01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:25.180
<v Speaker 1>you're not supposed to have a hole in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your heart and be a ceo and it would be </v>

1444
01:08:25.180 --> 01:08:25.180
<v Speaker 1>born with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was born with it.</v>

1445
01:08:25.180 --> 01:08:28.130
<v Speaker 1>It went undetected and me pushing so </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard.</v>

1446
01:08:28.131 --> 01:08:33.131
<v Speaker 1>So in 2009 I was training for this race </v>
<v Speaker 1>across America and um,</v>

1447
01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:34.970
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just couldn't go anymore.</v>

1448
01:08:35.060 --> 01:08:37.040
<v Speaker 1>Another pitfall in my life was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole.</v>

1449
01:08:37.610 --> 01:08:40.550
<v Speaker 1>And I was pretty much off active duty </v>
<v Speaker 1>seal for three years.</v>

1450
01:08:40.860 --> 01:08:43.010
<v Speaker 1>Then I had to harsh with them trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fix it.</v>

1451
01:08:43.011 --> 01:08:44.960
<v Speaker 1>So the whole was significantly large </v>
<v Speaker 1>account,</v>

1452
01:08:44.961 --> 01:08:48.620
<v Speaker 1>big it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say it was big as a quarter and I'm</v>

1453
01:08:48.621 --> 01:08:49.940
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the hell is big as a quarter?</v>

1454
01:08:49.941 --> 01:08:54.941
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a pretty big hole in your heart </v>

1455
01:08:54.941 --> 01:08:54.941
<v Speaker 1>because they had to helix patches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1456
01:08:54.941 --> 01:08:56.720
<v Speaker 1>that's impossible that the helix patches</v>
<v Speaker 1>there in my heart.</v>

1457
01:08:56.720 --> 01:08:58.640
<v Speaker 1>So the two stents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is a helix patch?</v>

1458
01:08:58.990 --> 01:09:01.190
<v Speaker 1>It is like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little Mesh.</v>

1459
01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:04.790
<v Speaker 1>Very like what they do for Hernias.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like something like maybe something like</v>

1460
01:09:04.791 --> 01:09:09.791
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they were in my artery and they </v>

1461
01:09:09.791 --> 01:09:09.791
<v Speaker 1>placed this patch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to go through your artery?</v>

1462
01:09:09.830 --> 01:09:14.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they went through my for more artery </v>

1463
01:09:14.830 --> 01:09:14.830
<v Speaker 1>with a camera?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1464
01:09:14.830 --> 01:09:15.470
<v Speaker 1>with the other cameras down through my </v>
<v Speaker 1>throat.</v>

1465
01:09:15.690 --> 01:09:20.690
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they put this catheter through my </v>

1466
01:09:20.690 --> 01:09:21.290
<v Speaker 1>artery that went to my heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

1467
01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:25.220
<v Speaker 1>they went and they took this helix </v>
<v Speaker 1>patched that.</v>

1468
01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:30.280
<v Speaker 1>They placed it in there and then they </v>
<v Speaker 1>found out six months later at the whole </v>

1469
01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:31.560
<v Speaker 1>wasn't covered up enough yet because a </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole,</v>

1470
01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.560
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the patch was very damn big hit.</v>

1471
01:09:34.580 --> 01:09:36.840
<v Speaker 1>So they put on and they go back in there</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 2010.</v>

1472
01:09:37.730 --> 01:09:42.730
<v Speaker 1>How's the patches adhere to your heart?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess your heart heals around the </v>

1473
01:09:42.730 --> 01:09:42.730
<v Speaker 1>patch.</v>

1474
01:09:42.730 --> 01:09:43.700
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But how did they stick it in place?</v>

1475
01:09:44.510 --> 01:09:48.680
<v Speaker 1>I guess they put it with the holes that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it Kinda like inflates.</v>

1476
01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:50.330
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole is at.</v>

1477
01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:54.340
<v Speaker 1>And then that thing goes in there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then it kinda covers a whole.</v>

1478
01:09:54.341 --> 01:09:59.341

<v Speaker 1>when that was a big deal.</v>

1526

01:12:06.420 --> 01:12:11.420
<v Speaker 1>he knew I was a navy guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think he was a ceo because not </v>

1530
01:12:11.420 --> 01:12:11.940
<v Speaker 1>many black guys are seals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he had a conversation about,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got fix this real quick.</v>

1533
01:12:15.090 --> 01:12:16.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean then I came up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was the seal.</v>

1534
01:12:17.610 --> 01:12:18.150
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1535
01:12:18.151 --> 01:12:20.760
<v Speaker 1>you could've died jumping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can die diving,</v>

1536
01:12:20.820 --> 01:12:25.820
<v Speaker 1>you could have died and all this stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>because basically the hole in your </v>

1537
01:12:25.820 --> 01:12:25.890
<v Speaker 1>heart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it gets plugged with something,</v>

1538
01:12:26.310 --> 01:12:27.460
<v Speaker 1>like anything like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1539
01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:30.600
<v Speaker 1>let's say you get a bubble from diving </v>
<v Speaker 1>or something like that,</v>

1540
01:12:30.630 --> 01:12:31.750
<v Speaker 1>you gonna die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1541
01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:33.500
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1542
01:12:33.820 --> 01:12:36.000
<v Speaker 1>I call it luck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I called look.</v>

1543
01:12:36.380 --> 01:12:37.770
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I uh,</v>

1544
01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:39.960
<v Speaker 1>I got through two surgeries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they put it back on,</v>

1545
01:12:40.190 --> 01:12:41.610
<v Speaker 1>I lost the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give you the first one,</v>

1546
01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:44.340
<v Speaker 1>and then when did they realize that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not good enough,</v>

1547
01:12:44.370 --> 01:12:46.320
<v Speaker 1>so they take you back and you can get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bubble study,</v>

1548
01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:47.940
<v Speaker 1>a bubble test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they,</v>

1549
01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:50.790
<v Speaker 1>so they like literally send bubbles that</v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

1550
01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:54.240
<v Speaker 1>safe bubbles that way to see if the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bubble goes through your heart.</v>

1551
01:12:54.540 --> 01:12:59.540
<v Speaker 1>So they have this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this echocardiogram again and they hook </v>

1552
01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:03.801
<v Speaker 1>you up I think to id or something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and they throw these bubbles </v>

1553
01:13:03.801 --> 01:13:06.501
<v Speaker 1>through your heart and they see if it </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes through after six months when it </v>

1554
01:13:06.501 --> 01:13:08.670
<v Speaker 1>should have been healed up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bubble went through.</v>

1555
01:13:09.550 --> 01:13:11.460
<v Speaker 1>So I had to tell me then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1556
01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:13.080
<v Speaker 1>we got gotta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1557
01:13:13.081 --> 01:13:14.670
<v Speaker 1>you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not good to go.</v>

1558
01:13:15.180 --> 01:13:20.180
<v Speaker 1>So I had to take a year before I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>have another surgery because one,</v>

1559
01:13:21.420 --> 01:13:23.730
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that patch had to be completely,</v>

1560
01:13:23.850 --> 01:13:27.000
<v Speaker 1>completely healed before they can go </v>
<v Speaker 1>back in time.</v>

1561
01:13:27.001 --> 01:13:28.770
<v Speaker 1>You knew you had a whole right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1562
01:13:28.771 --> 01:13:31.800
<v Speaker 1>So they knew how to hold because of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>heart surgery all the time.</v>

1563
01:13:31.830 --> 01:13:34.620
<v Speaker 1>Like when you're waiting for a deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you have an extra hole.</v>

1564
01:13:34.650 --> 01:13:35.070
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1565
01:13:35.071 --> 01:13:37.890
<v Speaker 1>I have a whole what we're allowed to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>with your body then.</v>

1566
01:13:38.100 --> 01:13:39.390
<v Speaker 1>Well at that time they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1567
01:13:39.420 --> 01:13:42.990
<v Speaker 1>do how you feel comfortable and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1568
01:13:43.410 --> 01:13:47.070
<v Speaker 1>the whole is not going to kill you right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now but you can't die.</v>

1569
01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:52.100
<v Speaker 1>You can't jump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You pretty much willing to steal </v>

1570
01:13:52.100 --> 01:13:54.170
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was a recruiter for a period of </v>

1571
01:13:54.170 --> 01:13:54.170
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1572
01:13:54.170 --> 01:13:57.260
<v Speaker 1>so basically I was crazy about that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>before my second surgery I was actually </v>

1573
01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:00.030
<v Speaker 1>training for Delta Force.</v>

1574
01:14:00.460 --> 01:14:05.460
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to go to Delta and I was </v>

1575
01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:09.261
<v Speaker 1>rocking recruiting a lot and before my </v>
<v Speaker 1>second truck running and you're running </v>

1576
01:14:09.261 --> 01:14:13.731
<v Speaker 1>with a pack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a pack on my back with some way on how </v>

1577
01:14:13.731 --> 01:14:13.731
<v Speaker 1>heavy the pack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>50,</v>

1578
01:14:13.731 --> 01:14:13.960
<v Speaker 1>60 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you run with that on.</v>

1579
01:14:14.020 --> 01:14:17.170
<v Speaker 1>Well you're supposed to hike or hump </v>
<v Speaker 1>like rock hopping,</v>

1580
01:14:17.230 --> 01:14:19.220
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ran with it because.</v>

1581
01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:20.230
<v Speaker 1>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1582
01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:22.190
<v Speaker 1>that's what I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1583
01:14:22.270 --> 01:14:26.080
<v Speaker 1>So the day before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the day of the day of heart surgery,</v>

1584
01:14:26.650 --> 01:14:31.650
<v Speaker 1>I did a ruck run because I knew I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be out of commission for </v>

1585
01:14:31.650 --> 01:14:33.520
<v Speaker 1>Awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So fuck it.</v>

1586
01:14:33.521 --> 01:14:34.780
<v Speaker 1>Matter get my last one in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

1587
01:14:35.050 --> 01:14:36.940
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I could do.</v>

1588
01:14:36.970 --> 01:14:39.250
<v Speaker 1>I have had my training log.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So after my second heart surgery,</v>

1589
01:14:39.251 --> 01:14:42.130
<v Speaker 1>all I could do was walk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I became an ultra walker,</v>

1590
01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:48.240
<v Speaker 1>walked my fucking ass off and I over a </v>
<v Speaker 1>period of time it took a year for that </v>

1591
01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:48.640
<v Speaker 1>thing to heal up the hill.</v>

1592
01:14:49.380 --> 01:14:54.380
<v Speaker 1>You know my first bubble study after my </v>
<v Speaker 1>second heart surgery came back negative </v>

1593
01:14:54.380 --> 01:14:55.990
<v Speaker 1>or positive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bubble went through again.</v>

1594
01:14:56.020 --> 01:14:58.330
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're going to crack me open.</v>

1595
01:14:58.420 --> 01:15:00.340
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Over that period of time,</v>

1596
01:15:00.341 --> 01:15:02.260
<v Speaker 1>my heart healed around that thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>nicely.</v>

1597
01:15:02.700 --> 01:15:07.700
<v Speaker 1>And I passed the second bubble tests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first bubble test was how long </v>

1598
01:15:07.700 --> 01:15:07.700
<v Speaker 1>after a year?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>

1599
01:15:07.700 --> 01:15:09.580
<v Speaker 1>So the first bubble tests after the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first surgery,</v>

1600
01:15:09.990 --> 01:15:14.990
<v Speaker 1>six months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you had to go through a full </v>

1601
01:15:14.990 --> 01:15:16.350
<v Speaker 1>six months after that totally heal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you have the second heart surgery.</v>

1602
01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:19.090
<v Speaker 1>And when does the bubble test fail?</v>
<v Speaker 1>After the second heart surgery,</v>

1603
01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:21.370
<v Speaker 1>it was about six months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ,</v>

1604
01:15:21.371 --> 01:15:22.900
<v Speaker 1>and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the doctor looked at me and said,</v>

1605
01:15:22.901 --> 01:15:27.901
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry to inform him that we get the </v>

1606
01:15:27.901 --> 01:15:27.901
<v Speaker 1>crack your chest open the next time </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're really getting there.</v>

1607
01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:31.000
<v Speaker 1>So I sat back thinking this could be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>third heart surgery,</v>

1608
01:15:32.230 --> 01:15:33.310
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1609
01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:36.370
<v Speaker 1>that one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they said we have to wait for six months</v>

1610
01:15:36.371 --> 01:15:38.480
<v Speaker 1>to see if this thing's gonna close up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1611
01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:40.010
<v Speaker 1>And I came back thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1612
01:15:40.011 --> 01:15:44.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm about to get cracked the fuck open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that bubble got pinned up,</v>

1613
01:15:44.981 --> 01:15:46.210
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go through,</v>

1614
01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:51.240
<v Speaker 1>maybe forced it through with your mind </v>
<v Speaker 1>and visualize and that's it,</v>

1615
01:15:52.091 --> 01:15:53.500
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's something to visualize.</v>

1616
01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:55.120
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I would think that you would be a go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy for injuries.</v>

1636
01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:39.460
<v Speaker 1>Like if anybody's ball game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had them all.</v>

1637
01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:42.340
<v Speaker 1>I've had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you broke the world record for Chin</v>

1638
01:16:42.341 --> 01:16:43.810
<v Speaker 1>ups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you rip your arm apart.</v>

1639
01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:44.470
<v Speaker 1>Pull ups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1640
01:16:44.470 --> 01:16:46.900
<v Speaker 1>So if you pull up the picture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a picture of my hand.</v>

1641
01:16:46.901 --> 01:16:51.901
<v Speaker 1>You'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll know what is the pull ups or pull </v>

1642
01:16:51.901 --> 01:16:55.471
<v Speaker 1>ups or here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hands our hands out and chin ups or </v>

1643
01:16:55.471 --> 01:16:55.950
<v Speaker 1>hands four hands forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I failed three times.</v>

1644
01:16:55.990 --> 01:16:58.750
<v Speaker 1>I failed twice before I finally got it </v>
<v Speaker 1>the third time.</v>

1645
01:16:58.751 --> 01:17:00.270
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1646
01:17:00.610 --> 01:17:03.100
<v Speaker 1>the first time I rip the shit out of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>forearm.</v>

1647
01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:08.620
<v Speaker 1>And then the second time you'll see </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a picture of my hand.</v>

1648
01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:12.350
<v Speaker 1>And it is a third degree burn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's my hand.</v>

1649
01:17:12.410 --> 01:17:14.480
<v Speaker 1>Oh Jesus,</v>

<v Speaker 1>a bit by a wolf.</v>

1651
01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:19.460

<v Speaker 1>as you see that,</v>

1652
01:17:19.461 --> 01:17:22.070

1653
01:17:22.580 --> 01:17:24.310
<v Speaker 1>So if you can imagine the pain of </v>

1706
01:19:44.420 --> 01:19:47.540
<v Speaker 1>Someone gets drunk at a certain whiskey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if they smell it,</v>

1707
01:19:47.541 --> 01:19:52.541
<v Speaker 1>they'll get disgusted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's like yeager mice or something </v>

1708

1752
01:21:40.471 --> 01:21:45.471
<v Speaker 1>We don't think that at that time it </v>
<v Speaker 1>could last forever and then you get to </v>

<v Speaker 1>the fucking quitting.</v>

1763
01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:09.900
<v Speaker 1>It's a lifetime of thinking about why </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fuck did I do that?</v>

1764
01:22:10.750 --> 01:22:12.150
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ain't fucking doing that.</v>

1765
01:22:13.310 --> 01:22:18.310
<v Speaker 2>There's something about talking to a guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you that a lot of people hope that </v>

1766
01:22:18.310 --> 01:22:21.620
<v Speaker 2>you're going to say some magic thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's going to click in their brain.</v>

1767
01:22:21.650 --> 01:22:23.720
<v Speaker 2>Everybody gets changed who they are,</v>

<v Speaker 2>What is the thing?</v>

1769
01:22:24.861 --> 01:22:29.861
<v Speaker 2>That's why people go to these self help </v>
<v Speaker 2>conferences and they take these classes </v>

1770
01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:35.690
<v Speaker 2>and they hope that someone's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>say something that changes the way their</v>

1771
01:22:35.691 --> 01:22:37.430
<v Speaker 2>mind works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hilarious to me.</v>

1772
01:22:37.550 --> 01:22:39.470
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of Larry's to me too.</v>

1773
01:22:39.471 --> 01:22:44.471
<v Speaker 2>But what is also hilarious is that what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're saying is that you have to do </v>

1774
01:22:46.251 --> 01:22:48.320
<v Speaker 2>those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to suffer,</v>

1775
01:22:48.410 --> 01:22:51.170
<v Speaker 2>you have to live in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be comfortable in it.</v>

1776
01:22:51.380 --> 01:22:56.030
<v Speaker 2>And then maybe some of that shit will </v>
<v Speaker 2>help you a little bit along the way</v>

1777
01:22:56.120 --> 01:22:58.610
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I went to,</v>

1778
01:22:58.860 --> 01:23:00.740

1785
01:23:18.850 --> 01:23:21.850
<v Speaker 1>and they were asking us all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions about the mind,</v>

1786
01:23:21.851 --> 01:23:26.851
<v Speaker 1>mental toughness and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was answering them and I wasn't </v>

1787
01:23:26.851 --> 01:23:27.640
<v Speaker 1>answering any questions and I'll never </v>
<v Speaker 1>forget he was just answering them off of</v>

1788
01:23:27.910 --> 01:23:30.670
<v Speaker 1>theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He never put his fucking ass and shit.</v>

1789
01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:36.000
<v Speaker 1>You read a bunch of fucking books and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you think that you know how to fucking </v>

1790
01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:39.271
<v Speaker 1>mind works and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had gone through hill to a kid and </v>

1791
01:23:39.271 --> 01:23:39.680
<v Speaker 1>then all the way up until now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1792
01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:40.750
<v Speaker 1>So I know.</v>

1793
01:23:41.670 --> 01:23:44.440
<v Speaker 1>So that theory is bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1794
01:23:44.441 --> 01:23:46.780
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of good stuff out there </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can read from people,</v>

1795
01:23:47.260 --> 01:23:51.250
<v Speaker 1>but I had lived hill and when you put </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself in hill,</v>

1796
01:23:51.700 --> 01:23:56.700
<v Speaker 1>that's the only time you can figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to fuck to get through that </v>

1797
01:23:56.700 --> 01:23:56.700
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>

1798
01:23:56.700 --> 01:23:59.930
<v Speaker 1>You can't read somebody else's book </v>
<v Speaker 1>about some theory on how to do shit.</v>

1799
01:23:59.960 --> 01:24:04.960
<v Speaker 1>Some guy who set up and they're a nice </v>
<v Speaker 1>warm office and read it and wrote some </v>

1800
01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:05.800
<v Speaker 1>book with a Nice Cup of coffee in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking hair.</v>

1801
01:24:05.801 --> 01:24:10.801
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to see that guy who put immersed </v>

1802
01:24:10.801 --> 01:24:15.151
<v Speaker 1>himself in fucking hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he thought about quitting and </v>

1803
01:24:15.151 --> 01:24:15.820
<v Speaker 1>leaving and him and his wife and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids.</v>

1804
01:24:15.821 --> 01:24:16.970
<v Speaker 1>And why am I here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this,</v>

1805
01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:21.790
<v Speaker 1>is it worth it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All this crazy shit is still said it.</v>

1806
01:24:21.791 --> 01:24:26.070
<v Speaker 1>Found out a way to get through it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So basically that's,</v>

1807
01:24:26.220 --> 01:24:27.700
<v Speaker 1>that's the bottom line of it all.</v>

1808
01:24:27.910 --> 01:24:31.780
<v Speaker 1>We all want to read about how we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly get somewhere.</v>

1809
01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:34.000
<v Speaker 1>That's why there's six minute abs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all this other shit.</v>

1810
01:24:34.001 --> 01:24:37.960
<v Speaker 1>So powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you make it some results from it,</v>

1811
01:24:37.990 --> 01:24:42.990
<v Speaker 1>but they're not permanent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The permanent result comes from you </v>

1812
01:24:42.990 --> 01:24:43.570
<v Speaker 1>fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say it all the time.</v>

1813
01:24:43.750 --> 01:24:48.750
<v Speaker 1>You have to suffer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to make that a tattoo on your </v>

1814
01:24:49.361 --> 01:24:52.630
<v Speaker 1>fucking brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when that time comes again,</v>

1815
01:24:53.140 --> 01:24:56.740
<v Speaker 1>you don't forget it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You may forget it for a second,</v>

1816
01:24:56.741 --> 01:24:58.570
<v Speaker 1>but you can go back in the cookie jar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I call it.</v>

1817
01:24:58.571 --> 01:25:01.480
<v Speaker 1>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something that we've all endured.</v>

1818
01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:04.780
<v Speaker 1>I call it the cookie jar and we often </v>
<v Speaker 1>forget how hard we are,</v>

1819
01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:06.970
<v Speaker 1>but you got to reflect back to a couple </v>
<v Speaker 1>of seconds.</v>

1820
01:25:06.980 --> 01:25:08.230
<v Speaker 1>Reflect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been through this,</v>

1821
01:25:08.231 --> 01:25:13.231
<v Speaker 1>I've been through that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then remind yourself I'm a bad </v>

1822
01:25:13.231 --> 01:25:14.380
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker and then you can get </v>
<v Speaker 1>through that shit,</v>

1823
01:25:14.381 --> 01:25:17.500
<v Speaker 1>but if you don't believe it even endorse</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

1824
01:25:18.220 --> 01:25:21.180
<v Speaker 1>You're just blowing smoke man and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>not going to get through anything.</v>

1825
01:25:21.220 --> 01:25:22.690
<v Speaker 1>What was this guy saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1826
01:25:22.691 --> 01:25:24.340
<v Speaker 1>what was his theories that he was thrown</v>
<v Speaker 1>out?</v>

1827
01:25:24.341 --> 01:25:26.860
<v Speaker 1>There is theories was about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget exactly what it was.</v>

1828
01:25:26.861 --> 01:25:31.861
<v Speaker 1>Was it something about what the mind </v>
<v Speaker 1>does under stress and how we can't.</v>

1829
01:25:32.740 --> 01:25:36.880
<v Speaker 1>He said how we can't do something and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>did it.</v>

1830
01:25:37.690 --> 01:25:39.410
<v Speaker 1>I did what he said we couldn't do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1831
01:25:39.430 --> 01:25:42.880
<v Speaker 1>what was he saying he couldn't do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was something about if you're born,</v>

1832
01:25:44.650 --> 01:25:47.230
<v Speaker 1>if you're born a certain way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if somebody,</v>

1833
01:25:47.231 --> 01:25:51.190
<v Speaker 1>if you're born a certain way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't become this way.</v>

1834
01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:57.160
<v Speaker 1>It was totally saying that who I am now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I had to be born with some genetic </v>

1835
01:25:58.781 --> 01:26:01.690
<v Speaker 1>power or some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some gift from God,</v>

1836
01:26:01.691 --> 01:26:05.340
<v Speaker 1>but I had to have some kind of special,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had had some kind of special gift.</v>

1837
01:26:05.370 --> 01:26:10.370
<v Speaker 1>I forget what set me off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was that we had to be to be </v>

1838
01:26:10.370 --> 01:26:11.210
<v Speaker 1>somewhere you had a baby born with.</v>

1839
01:26:11.210 --> 01:26:16.210
<v Speaker 1>It was a concept and I know what I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>born with and I know the battle that I </v>

1840
01:26:17.901 --> 01:26:20.330
<v Speaker 1>had in my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when he said it,</v>

1841
01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:23.330
<v Speaker 1>I sat there looking at my face and some </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the crowd asked me a question.</v>

1842
01:26:24.100 --> 01:26:26.690
<v Speaker 1>I totally contradicted everything he </v>
<v Speaker 1>said and I was like,</v>

1843
01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:27.800
<v Speaker 1>Nah man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1844
01:26:27.810 --> 01:26:32.810
<v Speaker 1>I know for a fact that you can be this </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked up dude like really fucked up </v>

1845
01:26:35.061 --> 01:26:39.190
<v Speaker 1>dude and with the right mindset and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

1846
01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:44.360
<v Speaker 1>It sounds so easy with the right mindset</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't sound easy to know what you're </v>

1847
01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:45.740
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds very simplistic answer,</v>

1848
01:26:45.741 --> 01:26:47.330
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can.</v>

1849
01:26:47.900 --> 01:26:52.900
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to go into a dark chambers </v>

1850
01:26:52.900 --> 01:26:53.870
<v Speaker 1>that we often shut off and you got to </v>
<v Speaker 1>open them up.</v>

1851
01:26:53.871 --> 01:26:56.570
<v Speaker 1>You get to open up and fight that </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking demon getting there.</v>

1852
01:26:56.571 --> 01:26:58.190
<v Speaker 1>Talk to that motherfucker and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's up?</v>

1853
01:26:59.060 --> 01:27:04.060
<v Speaker 1>And we often take the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all like to take this four lane </v>

1854
01:27:04.060 --> 01:27:06.200
<v Speaker 1>highway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The easy highway has has fucking signs.</v>

1855
01:27:06.201 --> 01:27:09.290
<v Speaker 1>It has restaurants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all loved that four lane highway.</v>

1856
01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:14.560
<v Speaker 1>We always step over the shovel and all I</v>
<v Speaker 1>did was I picked up that fucking shovel </v>

1857
01:27:14.900 --> 01:27:19.900
<v Speaker 1>and shovel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made my own path and you may have big </v>

1858
01:27:19.900 --> 01:27:23.051
<v Speaker 1>boulders and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They may be getting towards your miles </v>

1859
01:27:23.051 --> 01:27:23.810
<v Speaker 1>up the road faster than you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but going through this path of life,</v>

1860
01:27:23.811 --> 01:27:26.060
<v Speaker 1>this journey over here that you make </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>

1861
01:27:26.061 --> 01:27:29.360
<v Speaker 1>that's incredibly difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but comes out.</v>

1862
01:27:29.361 --> 01:27:34.361
<v Speaker 1>The other end of that motherfucker is </v>
<v Speaker 1>some glorious shit that you can't even </v>

1863
01:27:34.361 --> 01:27:37.130
<v Speaker 1>explain to people and we're afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bottom line is most of us,</v>

1864
01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:38.930
<v Speaker 1>even the people who have all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>theories and shit,</v>

1865
01:27:39.710 --> 01:27:43.700
<v Speaker 1>it's easier to accept the fact that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>just not good enough.</v>

1866
01:27:44.390 --> 01:27:46.640
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't made to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yes,</v>

1867
01:27:46.641 --> 01:27:50.330
<v Speaker 1>some of us can't be Lebron James,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll tell you right now,</v>

1868
01:27:50.331 --> 01:27:52.340
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can do a lot of shit when it comes to</v>

1869
01:27:52.341 --> 01:27:55.220
<v Speaker 1>this pure arm guts and willpower and </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting through shit.</v>

1870
01:27:55.670 --> 01:27:58.870
<v Speaker 1>We have a lot more with a lot more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>we think we have the other</v>

1871
01:27:59.030 --> 01:28:01.000
<v Speaker 2>album with a guy like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with his theories.</v>

1872
01:28:01.020 --> 01:28:06.020
<v Speaker 2>His theories are based on results and </v>
<v Speaker 2>those results are based on human beings </v>

1873
01:28:06.020 --> 01:28:09.701
<v Speaker 2>and most human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are certain people that are born </v>

1874
01:28:09.701 --> 01:28:09.701
<v Speaker 2>with certain gifts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a guy like Lebron James,</v>

1875
01:28:09.701 --> 01:28:13.100
<v Speaker 2>obvious physical talent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You Know Jon Jones and mma.</v>

1876
01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:15.410
<v Speaker 2>Obviously physical talent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's.</v>

1877
01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:20.360
<v Speaker 2>When you look at someone who's super </v>
<v Speaker 2>successful,</v>

1878
01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:25.480
<v Speaker 2>you always assume that it has to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of some sort of physical gifts </v>

1879
01:28:25.480 --> 01:28:28.760
<v Speaker 2>because people look at themselves and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure this doctor,</v>

1880
01:28:28.850 --> 01:28:31.990
<v Speaker 2>this old dude probably had like a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>gut and probably says exactly.</v>

1881
01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:36.260
<v Speaker 2>I looked a little tiny arms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>weak shoulders and probably thought,</v>

1882
01:28:36.261 --> 01:28:41.261
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are certain people that are just </v>

1883
01:28:41.261 --> 01:28:41.261
<v Speaker 2>Meza morphic and probably broke it down </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the scientific terms,</v>

1884
01:28:41.261 --> 01:28:41.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1885
01:28:41.331 --> 01:28:46.331
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just have a fast twitch muscle </v>

1886
01:28:46.331 --> 01:28:48.611
<v Speaker 2>fibers and they'll say all this crazy </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit that is true at the very highest </v>

1887
01:28:48.611 --> 01:28:50.360
<v Speaker 2>levels of the winners.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1888
01:28:50.570 --> 01:28:52.280
<v Speaker 2>But it doesn't mean that you can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>become that.</v>

1889
01:28:52.370 --> 01:28:57.370
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just means that it's too painful for </v>

1890
01:28:57.370 --> 01:28:57.410
<v Speaker 2>most people to go through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So very few people ever get there.</v>

1891
01:28:57.411 --> 01:29:00.170
<v Speaker 2>So if you look at the actual results,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would be correct,</v>

1892
01:29:00.730 --> 01:29:01.860
<v Speaker 2>but he's not correct</v>

1893
01:29:02.250 --> 01:29:04.350
<v Speaker 1>because he doesn't take the shovel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1894
01:29:04.500 --> 01:29:08.700
<v Speaker 1>That's the moral of the story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does not some easy lit up street lights,</v>

1895
01:29:08.701 --> 01:29:11.460
<v Speaker 1>wrath with nice smooth roads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1896
01:29:11.790 --> 01:29:14.910
<v Speaker 1>It's a difficult motherfucker where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to fail and you're going to</v>

1897
01:29:14.911 --> 01:29:19.911
<v Speaker 1>be in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can be saying I'm not good enough </v>

1898
01:29:19.911 --> 01:29:22.590
<v Speaker 1>and it's how you get through that is how</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get through that on a daily basis.</v>

1899
01:29:22.591 --> 01:29:25.980
<v Speaker 1>When that thing is st man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm 43.</v>

1900
01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:29.010
<v Speaker 1>I've done so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You start to become civilized.</v>

1901
01:29:29.460 --> 01:29:33.330
<v Speaker 1>The refrigerator gets full.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You start making money and you start.</v>

1902
01:29:33.860 --> 01:29:38.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm not getting cold anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm retired once in at 40 people.</v>

1903
01:29:38.790 --> 01:29:41.570
<v Speaker 1>Shouldn't it be playing basketball or </v>
<v Speaker 1>football or or,</v>

1904
01:29:41.571 --> 01:29:46.571
<v Speaker 1>or being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You start to believe this shit and it </v>

1905
01:29:46.571 --> 01:29:49.851
<v Speaker 1>becomes in your fucking mind like </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's people who are retiring at 47 </v>

1906
01:29:49.851 --> 01:29:50.800
<v Speaker 1>years old or 30 something years old at </v>
<v Speaker 1>43,</v>

1907
01:29:50.801 --> 01:29:55.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm still putting in hundred mile weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>still doing thousands of pullups pushups</v>

1908
01:29:56.220 --> 01:29:59.070
<v Speaker 1>because I'm not allowing myself to </v>
<v Speaker 1>become civilized.</v>

1909
01:29:59.100 --> 01:30:01.170
<v Speaker 1>The worst that can happen to a man's </v>
<v Speaker 1>become civilized.</v>

1910
01:30:01.800 --> 01:30:03.450
<v Speaker 1>You lose that fucking fight you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1911
01:30:03.451 --> 01:30:03.750
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1912
01:30:03.751 --> 01:30:06.450
<v Speaker 1>you lose that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why the fuck am I doing this shit?</v>

1913
01:30:07.140 --> 01:30:09.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Ain't good man.</v>

1914
01:30:09.840 --> 01:30:12.780
<v Speaker 1>You ain't never fucking arrived and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just my mentality.</v>

1915
01:30:12.781 --> 01:30:15.050
<v Speaker 1>You may have more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you'd never fucking arrived.</v>

1916
01:30:15.060 --> 01:30:17.280
<v Speaker 1>You want to be uncommon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I must uncommon people,</v>

1917
01:30:18.240 --> 01:30:21.570
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uncommon amongst uncommon peoples.</v>

1918
01:30:21.571 --> 01:30:23.640
<v Speaker 1>One of the greatest ways to put it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

1919
01:30:23.850 --> 01:30:24.810
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

1920
01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:26.160
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're like,</v>

1921
01:30:26.161 --> 01:30:31.161
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what got me in trouble with the navy </v>

1922
01:30:31.161 --> 01:30:32.040
<v Speaker 1>seals is I wanted to be one so bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so bad.</v>

1923
01:30:32.041 --> 01:30:34.980
<v Speaker 1>I fought my ass off and I saw them as </v>
<v Speaker 1>uncommon.</v>

1924
01:30:34.981 --> 01:30:36.780
<v Speaker 1>People.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very uncommon.</v>

1925
01:30:37.200 --> 01:30:40.020
<v Speaker 1>But once you become a navy seal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you all navy seal.</v>

1926
01:30:40.030 --> 01:30:41.530
<v Speaker 1>So guess what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your fucking common.</v>

1927
01:30:41.531 --> 01:30:46.531
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to be uncommon and months </v>

1928
01:30:46.531 --> 01:30:46.800

1941
01:31:20.690 --> 01:31:25.221
<v Speaker 1>in trouble a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I went to ranger school as a </v>

1942
01:31:25.221 --> 01:31:25.221
<v Speaker 1>seal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I tried to go to Delta force</v>

<v Speaker 1>twice.</v>

1945
01:31:30.710 --> 01:31:32.241
<v Speaker 1>training programs because I was looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>for in the military where I say all is </v>

1946
01:31:32.590 --> 01:31:33.330
<v Speaker 1>in the training.</v>

1947
01:31:33.930 --> 01:31:37.080
<v Speaker 1>These people get their ass handed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>them after they get out.</v>

1948
01:31:37.110 --> 01:31:42.110
<v Speaker 1>A lot of them get civilized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always wanted to go back into </v>

1949
01:31:42.110 --> 01:31:43.010
<v Speaker 1>training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I?</v>

1950
01:31:43.030 --> 01:31:48.030
<v Speaker 1>We're always that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to go back to war and the war </v>

1951
01:31:48.030 --> 01:31:48.030
<v Speaker 1>was in that training program where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>see guys,</v>

1952
01:31:48.030 --> 01:31:52.911
<v Speaker 1>you can quit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guys who are brutal guys who are </v>

1953
01:31:52.911 --> 01:31:52.911
<v Speaker 1>suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys who are.</v>

1954
01:31:52.911 --> 01:31:56.150
<v Speaker 1>You Go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as a ceo you don't volunteer for </v>

1955
01:31:56.150 --> 01:31:56.150
<v Speaker 1>ranger school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

1956
01:31:56.150 --> 01:31:57.060
<v Speaker 1>I put in seven chips,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got turned down by eighth grade.</v>

1957
01:31:57.360 --> 01:31:59.860

<v Speaker 1>I went at 28,</v>

1958
01:31:59.861 --> 01:32:03.460
<v Speaker 1>29 years old and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't you go?</v>

1959
01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:07.360
<v Speaker 1>Because I started becoming civilized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started becoming complacent.</v>

1960
01:32:07.760 --> 01:32:12.760
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I needed to get my fucking ass kicked </v>

1961
01:32:12.760 --> 01:32:15.151
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you go as a seal going down to </v>

1962
01:32:15.151 --> 01:32:15.460
<v Speaker 1>you have no rank and ranger school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be a major.</v>

1963
01:32:15.730 --> 01:32:20.080
<v Speaker 1>You just fucking Joe Brown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're nobody and you're not eating,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you're not sleeping.</v>

1965
01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:25.800
<v Speaker 1>So I always would put myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really immerse myself and shit like </v>

1966
01:32:25.800 --> 01:32:29.161
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even our climb the ladder and I </v>

1967
01:32:29.161 --> 01:32:29.360
<v Speaker 1>intentionally fall back down that </v>
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker.</v>

1968
01:32:29.361 --> 01:32:30.070
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right man,</v>

1969
01:32:30.730 --> 01:32:32.950
<v Speaker 1>getting soft dude,</v>

1971
01:32:35.960 --> 01:32:37.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of the process.</v>

1972
01:32:37.510 --> 01:32:42.510
<v Speaker 1>Did you find resistance from that </v>
<v Speaker 1>amongst other guys that didn't like to </v>

1973
01:32:42.510 --> 01:32:47.101
<v Speaker 1>make the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were making them uncomfortable </v>

1974
01:32:47.101 --> 01:32:48.871
<v Speaker 1>because that is something that people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a natural instinct that people </v>

1975
01:32:48.871 --> 01:32:52.621
<v Speaker 1>have when someone's working harder than </v>
<v Speaker 1>them to somehow another diminish that </v>

1976
01:32:52.621 --> 01:32:52.621
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1977
01:32:52.621 --> 01:32:56.080
<v Speaker 1>I know that a lot of guys don't mind me </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a lot of reasons and I realized that</v>

1978
01:32:56.380 --> 01:32:58.810
<v Speaker 1>I am a guy that doesn't care if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>liked me or not.</v>

1979
01:32:59.290 --> 01:33:04.290
<v Speaker 1>And when you're an Alpha male and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>against other offer males and we eat our</v>

1980
01:33:04.361 --> 01:33:06.490
<v Speaker 1>own alpha males eat their own.</v>

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:10.120
<v Speaker 1>And I loved that shit is fucking gold </v>

<v Speaker 1>but I would sometimes take it to another</v>

1984
01:33:15.191 --> 01:33:18.520
<v Speaker 1>level and I wasn't part of a of a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>old boy network.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Everybody eating you the fuck up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe you found a good way how I did</v>

2043
01:35:56.631 --> 01:36:01.631
<v Speaker 1>growing up on how they ignore that voice</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's saying you ain't facing some </v>

2044
01:36:01.631 --> 01:36:03.020
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Period,</v>

2045
01:36:03.021 --> 01:36:04.430
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not special.</v>

2046
01:36:04.431 --> 01:36:05.660
<v Speaker 1>I just stopped listing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

2047
01:36:05.661 --> 01:36:10.070
<v Speaker 1>I listened to that voice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's why I talk so fucking aggressive.</v>

2048
01:36:10.430 --> 01:36:10.970
<v Speaker 1>People said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2049
01:36:11.030 --> 01:36:12.770
<v Speaker 1>do you believe in God your customer </v>
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>

2050
01:36:14.120 --> 01:36:19.120
<v Speaker 1>When I say fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's letting you know what I'm thinking.</v>

2051
01:36:19.970 --> 01:36:22.940
<v Speaker 1>If I try to make it all pretty and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not what my life was.</v>

2052
01:36:23.720 --> 01:36:28.720
<v Speaker 1>It was a violent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>violent struggle daily to get where I'm </v>

2053
01:36:28.761 --> 01:36:31.040
<v Speaker 1>at today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not gonna water down.</v>

2054
01:36:31.450 --> 01:36:33.140
<v Speaker 1>Knock a water down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit wasn't fun.</v>

2055
01:36:34.050 --> 01:36:36.320
<v Speaker 1>It ain't fun today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm happy.</v>

2056
01:36:37.400 --> 01:36:42.400
<v Speaker 2>Don't you think that your happiness is </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably elevated by the amount of pain </v>

2057
01:36:44.361 --> 01:36:45.980
<v Speaker 2>that you've gone through?</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent.</v>

2058
01:36:45.981 --> 01:36:48.200
<v Speaker 2>So the amount of suffering that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand,</v>

2059
01:36:48.201 --> 01:36:53.201
<v Speaker 2>the amount of pain that you've gone </v>
<v Speaker 2>through makes you appreciate the </v>

2060
01:36:53.201 --> 01:36:55.370
<v Speaker 2>happiness and the beautiful moments with</v>
<v Speaker 2>much more intensity.</v>

2061
01:36:55.430 --> 01:36:58.440
<v Speaker 2>That's what people miss about my story </v>
<v Speaker 2>week.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I have a lot more shit to do.</v>

2077
01:37:38.530 --> 01:37:39.420

<v Speaker 2>And like there's</v>

2084
01:37:56.010 --> 01:37:57.870
<v Speaker 1>a quote that was said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who said it.</v>

2085
01:37:57.910 --> 01:38:00.270
<v Speaker 1>It was a great quote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy said,</v>

2086
01:38:00.271 --> 01:38:05.271
<v Speaker 1>I'm going into combat going into war of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the 100 men that go into war tensioning </v>

<v Speaker 1>One is a warrior and it's a true quote </v>

2089
01:38:18.810 --> 01:38:21.390
<v Speaker 1>to life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw it going through train.</v>

2090
01:38:21.391 --> 01:38:26.391
<v Speaker 1>I saw it everywhere I went.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so many people who just show up </v>

2091
01:38:26.391 --> 01:38:30.120
<v Speaker 1>to life that shouldn't even fucking be </v>
<v Speaker 1>around and there's few people do all the</v>

2092
01:38:30.121 --> 01:38:31.890
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to be part of that nine.</v>

2093
01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:37.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm working towards being that one and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just how I live my life now.</v>

2094
01:38:37.471 --> 01:38:39.180
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing with your life these </v>
<v Speaker 1>days?</v>

2095
01:38:39.630 --> 01:38:42.630
<v Speaker 1>Right now I keep the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very routine.</v>

2096
01:38:43.290 --> 01:38:44.520
<v Speaker 1>I get up every morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I run,</v>

2097
01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.730
<v Speaker 1>I go to the gym and then at nighttime I </v>
<v Speaker 1>stretch out.</v>

2098
01:38:48.330 --> 01:38:53.330
<v Speaker 1>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just trying to develop a business </v>

2099
01:38:53.330 --> 01:38:53.330
<v Speaker 1>costing me a lot of money trying to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2100
01:38:53.330 --> 01:38:54.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm just getting out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm A.</v>

2101
01:38:54.720 --> 01:38:58.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm an introvert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I never want to get on social media.</v>

2102
01:38:58.180 --> 01:39:03.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm not big on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm big on being with yourself.</v>

2103
01:39:03.300 --> 01:39:07.410
<v Speaker 1>I believe all these fucking cameras and </v>
<v Speaker 1>phones and shit,</v>

2104
01:39:07.550 --> 01:39:10.590
<v Speaker 1>it takes you away from the most powerful</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing in the world,</v>

2105
01:39:10.591 --> 01:39:14.610
<v Speaker 1>which is your fucking mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I try hard to continue to grow that.</v>

2106
01:39:14.680 --> 01:39:18.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to break a record again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to cross death valley as fast</v>

2107
01:39:18.481 --> 01:39:21.240
<v Speaker 1>as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The top of Mount Whitney and I'm.</v>

2108
01:39:21.330 --> 01:39:22.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm constantly trying to put goals in </v>
<v Speaker 1>front me,</v>

2109
01:39:22.831 --> 01:39:27.831
<v Speaker 1>but the biggest thing that I'm trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>find more of myself and the only way I </v>

2110
01:39:27.831 --> 01:39:31.191
<v Speaker 1>can find more as to silence the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>out as much as I can because it's </v>

2111
01:39:31.191 --> 01:39:35.040
<v Speaker 1>getting busier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyday is getting faster and the </v>

2112
01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:38.271
<v Speaker 1>faster it gets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more you are missing who the fuck </v>

<v Speaker 1>you are.</v>

2114
01:39:38.271 --> 01:39:40.290
<v Speaker 1>So I track my own mind a lot and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look man,</v>

2115
01:39:40.350 --> 01:39:42.990

<v Speaker 1>I put shit away and I go dark.</v>

2116
01:39:43.590 --> 01:39:46.350
<v Speaker 1>I go dark a lot and it's because I have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to find out.</v>

2117
01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:51.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm on a journey of life and we all have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a different journey and I want to be in </v>

<v Speaker 1>I want to be forever proud of who I was </v>

2123

<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is wrong with you?</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going back through the suffering</v>

<v Speaker 1>to the point where I can slowly,</v>

2259
01:46:21.230 --> 01:46:25.040
<v Speaker 1>hopefully make people feel motivated to </v>
<v Speaker 1>driven because motivation is crap.</v>

<v Speaker 1>People right now maybe listen to this </v>

2261

2262
01:46:30.270 --> 01:46:33.230
<v Speaker 1>If it's cold somewhere where they're at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of my friends will shut that door,</v>

2263
01:46:33.231 --> 01:46:34.880
<v Speaker 1>go back inside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's motivation.</v>

2264
01:46:35.330 --> 01:46:39.440
<v Speaker 1>It comes and go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As how you feel if you and your wife are</v>

2265
01:46:39.441 --> 01:46:40.730

<v Speaker 1>if you and your kids are good,</v>

2266
01:46:40.731 --> 01:46:43.310
<v Speaker 1>if you're good at work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're motivated.</v>

2267
01:46:44.150 --> 01:46:46.310
<v Speaker 1>I like the motherfucker whose life is </v>
<v Speaker 1>imploded,</v>

2268
01:46:47.210 --> 01:46:49.680
<v Speaker 1>ain't got shit in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says,</v>

2269
01:46:50.950 --> 01:46:52.620
<v Speaker 1>still got fucking get after it today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2270
01:46:53.210 --> 01:46:58.210
<v Speaker 1>To is about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's when you move from motivation </v>

2271
01:46:58.210 --> 01:47:00.681
<v Speaker 1>to driven to obsessed and I want people </v>
<v Speaker 1>to realize once you get to this person </v>

2272
01:47:00.681 --> 01:47:02.910
<v Speaker 1>over here the driven obsessed part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're unstoppable.</v>

2273
01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:08.480
<v Speaker 2>This commitment that you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>authenticity is one of the reasons why </v>

2274
01:47:08.480 --> 01:47:09.810
<v Speaker 2>people are connected to what your </v>
<v Speaker 2>messages.</v>

2275
01:47:10.230 --> 01:47:12.120
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the reasons why what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're saying,</v>

2276
01:47:12.121 --> 01:47:14.820
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to grow too fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want it to be bullshit.</v>

2277
01:47:14.821 --> 01:47:19.821
<v Speaker 2>You're terrified of that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like we were talking about with </v>

2278
01:47:19.821 --> 01:47:22.491
<v Speaker 2>weak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are terrified of seeing that </v>

2279
01:47:22.491 --> 01:47:22.491
<v Speaker 2>weakness in yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2280
01:47:22.491 --> 01:47:26.331
<v Speaker 2>we all see that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've all seen motivational things that </v>

2281
01:47:26.331 --> 01:47:29.601
<v Speaker 2>are bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've all talked to people that are </v>

2282
01:47:29.601 --> 01:47:30.810
<v Speaker 2>talking and you realize there's nothing </v>
<v Speaker 2>really that they're connected to.</v>

2283
01:47:30.870 --> 01:47:32.400
<v Speaker 2>They're not really connected to their </v>
<v Speaker 2>words,</v>

2284
01:47:32.430 --> 01:47:37.430
<v Speaker 2>the words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a bunch of words that they've </v>

2285
01:47:37.430 --> 01:47:38.700
<v Speaker 2>pieced together because they sound like </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that someone who's enlightened</v>

2286
01:47:38.701 --> 01:47:41.560
<v Speaker 2>on the subject would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2287
01:47:41.580 --> 01:47:42.360
<v Speaker 2>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't,</v>

2288
01:47:42.361 --> 01:47:44.010
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't connect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2289
01:47:44.190 --> 01:47:49.190
<v Speaker 2>so you're struggle now is to try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out how to stay you and get the </v>

2290
01:47:49.190 --> 01:47:53.991
<v Speaker 2>message out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but still be fully connected to that </v>

2291
01:47:53.991 --> 01:47:53.991
<v Speaker 2>message.</v>

2292
01:47:53.991 --> 01:47:53.991
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

2293
01:47:53.991 --> 01:47:58.340
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not so much a struggle because </v>

2294
01:47:58.340 --> 01:47:58.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm not really about.</v>

2295
01:48:01.100 --> 01:48:02.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm not driven by the business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

2296
01:48:02.660 --> 01:48:07.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing by trying to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I make a very small salary from being </v>

2297
01:48:07.660 --> 01:48:08.630
<v Speaker 1>retired from the military.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all I need.</v>

2298
01:48:09.350 --> 01:48:11.150
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not fast to A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a,</v>

2299
01:48:11.151 --> 01:48:15.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm a minimalist motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give me a backpack of fucking ground and</v>

2300
01:48:15.261 --> 01:48:20.261
<v Speaker 1>sleep on and a pull up bar and a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>some running shoes in a subway sandwich </v>

2301
01:48:20.481 --> 01:48:23.660
<v Speaker 1>or some shit and I'm fucking straight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

2302
01:48:23.661 --> 01:48:25.370
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe in patients.</v>

2303
01:48:26.210 --> 01:48:31.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm a patient dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can watch the piece of grass grow for </v>

2304
01:48:31.210 --> 01:48:34.631
<v Speaker 1>20 years because I know that it is how </v>
<v Speaker 1>you get somewhere in life by being that </v>

2305
01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:41.800
<v Speaker 1>month like mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And being able to watch something grow </v>

2306
01:48:41.800 --> 01:48:42.920
<v Speaker 1>very commonly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>patiently,</v>

2307
01:48:43.190 --> 01:48:45.260
<v Speaker 1>and that's all I'm doing right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not about money.</v>

2308
01:48:45.261 --> 01:48:46.910
<v Speaker 1>It's about people knowing me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll keep you like me.</v>

2309
01:48:47.390 --> 01:48:50.600
<v Speaker 1>Whoever wants to hear this is out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also your,</v>

2310
01:48:50.601 --> 01:48:53.720
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your goal is to grow this slowly,</v>

2311
01:48:53.750 --> 01:48:58.750
<v Speaker 1>very slowly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And your goal is to grow this in order </v>

2312
01:48:58.750 --> 01:48:59.510
<v Speaker 1>to impact people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Period.</v>

2313
01:49:00.200 --> 01:49:01.640
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not about me.</v>

2314
01:49:02.150 --> 01:49:04.850
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you get out of impacting people?</v>

2315
01:49:07.410 --> 01:49:08.520
<v Speaker 1>It's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

2316
01:49:08.690 --> 01:49:11.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't get anything out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a tool,</v>

2317
01:49:11.850 --> 01:49:16.850
<v Speaker 2>but you must get something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It must be personal satisfaction and </v>

2318
01:49:16.850 --> 01:49:17.700
<v Speaker 2>must be a connection to those people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That must be,</v>

2319
01:49:17.701 --> 01:49:18.900
<v Speaker 2>it must be enriching to you.</v>

2320
01:49:19.040 --> 01:49:24.040
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to connect with people because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's quite a few now that are coming </v>

2321
01:49:24.040 --> 01:49:24.590
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's my duty.</v>

2322
01:49:25.520 --> 01:49:30.520
<v Speaker 1>It's my duty to share my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like is somebody who </v>

2323
01:49:30.680 --> 01:49:33.020
<v Speaker 1>discovered a new earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2324
01:49:33.460 --> 01:49:37.070
<v Speaker 1>and discovered that people in the water </v>
<v Speaker 1>source and the food source.</v>

2325
01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:42.680
<v Speaker 1>I discovered a whole nother part of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking brain that a lot of people don't</v>

2326
01:49:43.161 --> 01:49:48.161
<v Speaker 1>even know about is my job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I being a fucking on this journey of </v>

2327
01:49:48.161 --> 01:49:51.420
<v Speaker 1>being a discovery person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being the person that maybe I discovered</v>

2328
01:49:51.460 --> 01:49:53.710
<v Speaker 1>this part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I discovered a very important part to.</v>

2329
01:49:53.720 --> 01:49:58.720
<v Speaker 1>I haven't met many people that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovered as part of a lot out there,</v>

2330
01:49:59.530 --> 01:50:04.530
<v Speaker 1>but it's my job now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take these weak people in the category </v>

2331
01:50:04.530 --> 01:50:07.330
<v Speaker 1>that I was in and say I stopped reading </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bullshit.</v>

2332
01:50:07.331 --> 01:50:12.331
<v Speaker 1>Stop listening to the bullshit and if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if my story of success can impact </v>

2333
01:50:12.521 --> 01:50:13.570
<v Speaker 1>somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is my job.</v>

2334
01:50:13.570 --> 01:50:17.410
<v Speaker 1>It's my duty to share the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As much as I'm not really fond of it,</v>

2335
01:50:17.940 --> 01:50:18.820
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>

2336
01:50:18.821 --> 01:50:21.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm the kind of guy that wants to sit in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fucking room and just be me.</v>

2337
01:50:22.630 --> 01:50:27.630
<v Speaker 1>Just be me alone by myself as who I am,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have to get uncomfortable and tell</v>

2338
01:50:29.621 --> 01:50:34.621
<v Speaker 1>people all this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it feels good to tell me about </v>

2339
01:50:34.621 --> 01:50:36.901
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At a fourth grade reading level in high </v>

2340
01:50:36.901 --> 01:50:36.901
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I stuttered.</v>

2341
01:50:36.901 --> 01:50:38.320
<v Speaker 1>I lied to people to be their fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends.</v>

2342
01:50:39.280 --> 01:50:41.440
<v Speaker 1>It didn't feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't feel good at all,</v>

2343
01:50:41.770 --> 01:50:46.720
<v Speaker 1>but maybe someone is doing the same shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe they can realize,</v>

2344
01:50:46.721 --> 01:50:51.721
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that motherfucker was a piece of shit </v>

2345
01:50:51.721 --> 01:50:54.800
<v Speaker 1>and he fucking now as a navy seal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>retired guy and runs these miles and was</v>

<v Speaker 1>297 pounds and pathetic fucker.</v>

2349
01:51:03.070 --> 01:51:05.470
<v Speaker 1>I was a fucking pathetic motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2350
01:51:05.500 --> 01:51:07.540
<v Speaker 1>People cannot say that to themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This.</v>

2351
01:51:07.900 --> 01:51:11.130
<v Speaker 1>We have to choose these great fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>magical words that,</v>

2352
01:51:11.290 --> 01:51:16.250
<v Speaker 1>that makes that make people feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell yourself the truth is,</v>

<v Speaker 1>but you might be fucking dumb.</v>

2356
01:51:27.850 --> 01:51:28.660
<v Speaker 1>It's life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2357
01:51:28.661 --> 01:51:32.650
<v Speaker 1>Take it for what it's worth and change </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and that terrible feeling.</v>

2358
01:51:32.651 --> 01:51:34.540
<v Speaker 1>When someone does tell you that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>fat,</v>

2359
01:51:35.050 --> 01:51:36.640
<v Speaker 1>you can use that as fuel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as fuel,</v>

2360
01:51:37.180 --> 01:51:39.220
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's all this is about.</v>

2361
01:51:39.320 --> 01:51:39.980
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2362
01:51:39.981 --> 01:51:44.140
<v Speaker 1>and where it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it goes somewhere and whatever,</v>

2363
01:51:44.640 --> 01:51:46.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a shit.</v>

2364
01:51:46.360 --> 01:51:51.360
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you said something that I think of when </v>

2365
01:51:51.360 --> 01:51:51.360
<v Speaker 1>I run and I said most people quit at 40 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>

2366
01:51:51.460 --> 01:51:53.020
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's my 40 percent rule,</v>

2367
01:51:53.021 --> 01:51:53.320
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2368
01:51:53.680 --> 01:51:55.540
<v Speaker 1>I love that quote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forty percent rule man.</v>

2369
01:51:55.541 --> 01:51:56.140
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2370
01:51:56.730 --> 01:51:58.750
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really developed that through my heart</v>

2371
01:51:58.751 --> 01:52:01.420
<v Speaker 1>surgeries and I developed that through </v>
<v Speaker 1>that first hundred mile run.</v>

2372
01:52:01.930 --> 01:52:05.800
<v Speaker 1>And I thought I had given 100 percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was on that chair at mile 70.</v>

2373
01:52:05.801 --> 01:52:10.801
<v Speaker 1>I was fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I'd give it 100 percent and </v>

2374
01:52:10.801 --> 01:52:10.801
<v Speaker 1>they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that last I go,</v>

2375
01:52:10.801 --> 01:52:11.860
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there has this.</v>

2376
01:52:12.640 --> 01:52:17.640
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't even near 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I came up with this thing called the </v>

2377
01:52:17.640 --> 01:52:21.190
<v Speaker 1>40 percent rule is basically where you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a car,</v>

2378
01:52:21.400 --> 01:52:25.570
<v Speaker 1>you put a governor on a car and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>said the car can go 1:30.</v>

2379
01:52:25.571 --> 01:52:27.430
<v Speaker 1>That governor stops the car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>91.</v>

2380
01:52:27.880 --> 01:52:29.030
<v Speaker 1>And your drive and thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2381
01:52:29.031 --> 01:52:30.670
<v Speaker 1>I want to fucking Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can't go.</v>

2382
01:52:30.850 --> 01:52:33.340
<v Speaker 1>I can't go any faster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do at your brain.</v>

2383
01:52:33.341 --> 01:52:34.650
<v Speaker 1>We put a governor on the brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>secretary,</v>

2384
01:52:34.720 --> 01:52:36.460
<v Speaker 1>feel pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>discomfort,</v>

2385
01:52:36.910 --> 01:52:41.910
<v Speaker 1>suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those words that we hate to say </v>

2386
01:52:41.910 --> 01:52:41.910
<v Speaker 1>because we in this happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>peaceful world we live in.</v>

2387
01:52:41.910 --> 01:52:44.800
<v Speaker 1>Now we stop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we slow down,</v>

2388
01:52:45.250 --> 01:52:50.250
<v Speaker 1>and if you can get through these </v>
<v Speaker 1>different barriers and gain five </v>

2389
01:52:50.250 --> 01:52:50.250
<v Speaker 1>percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two percent,</v>

2390
01:52:50.250 --> 01:52:52.010
<v Speaker 1>three percent debt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 percent becomes 60,</v>

2391
01:52:52.240 --> 01:52:53.980
<v Speaker 1>that 60,</v>
<v Speaker 1>70,</v>

2392
01:52:54.050 --> 01:52:59.050
<v Speaker 1>80 and 90,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you'll hopefully one day near </v>

2393
01:52:59.050 --> 01:52:59.050
<v Speaker 1>100.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

2394
01:52:59.050 --> 01:52:59.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many people will probably add 100.</v>

2395
01:53:00.070 --> 01:53:01.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean we think we're there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's so much more.</v>

2396
01:53:01.880 --> 01:53:03.860
<v Speaker 1>It isn't a 100 death's door though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>

2397
01:53:04.390 --> 01:53:05.840
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think is true.</v>

2398
01:53:06.320 --> 01:53:09.620
<v Speaker 1>I think that's 100 percent true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think when you were laying on top,</v>

2399
01:53:09.630 --> 01:53:13.070
<v Speaker 1>you'd knocked on a door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a hundred percent true.</v>

2400
01:53:13.100 --> 01:53:15.140
<v Speaker 1>No one has ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is 100 percent truth.</v>

2401
01:53:15.620 --> 01:53:19.340
<v Speaker 1>I didn't give 100 percent in that 101 </v>
<v Speaker 1>mile run I did for the first time.</v>

2402
01:53:20.120 --> 01:53:23.150
<v Speaker 1>So that's the scary thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the scariest thing in the world.</v>

2403
01:53:23.151 --> 01:53:26.300
<v Speaker 1>I didn't die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You probably gave 99 point nine,</v>

2404
01:53:26.301 --> 01:53:26.900
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>

<v Speaker 1>than that.</v>
