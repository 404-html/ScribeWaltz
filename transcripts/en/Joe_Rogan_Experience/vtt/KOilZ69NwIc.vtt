00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
Shannon,
it's been a while.

2
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.860
[inaudible] live.
We're live.
Do you wanna talk about that or no?
Shane thing.

3
00:00:14.861 --> 00:00:16.950
Did you have something to say?
Everyone's,
I mean the clip and uh,

4
00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.740
and I think you said something about taking a knee in the middle of a gunfight.

5
00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.500
And he said,
yeah,
that was bad.
And he's a fucking savage.
What did you do?

6
00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.410
What happened?
Refresh.
My memory were in Afghanistan,
right.
And the guys,

7
00:00:29.411 --> 00:00:33.310
I'm with the Afghan soldiers on with gang bushed by the Taliban and I just went

8
00:00:33.311 --> 00:00:37.570
down on one knee and carried on talking.
Ah,
um,
and chain said,
yeah,

9
00:00:37.571 --> 00:00:41.660
he's fucking so apparently that's a compliment.
I wasn't sure who were,

10
00:00:41.661 --> 00:00:45.070
journalists are very fascinating people to me because,
uh,

11
00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:50.130
oftentimes you guys move towards the gunfire with the camera to get the shot.

12
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.820
And you know,
I've talked to folks before who have worked as a,

13
00:00:55.821 --> 00:01:00.760
a war journalist and they say,
you almost don't think you're,
you,
you,

14
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.940
you're,
you,
you're so concentrated on getting the shot.

15
00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:08.590
You don't think about the fact that you might get shot.
It's a safety mechanism.

16
00:01:08.591 --> 00:01:08.741
Yeah.

17
00:01:08.741 --> 00:01:11.980
You think you're protected by looking at it on a screen rather than realizing

18
00:01:11.981 --> 00:01:15.340
it's,
it's actually happening in real life right now.
That is stupid.

19
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.280
It's so strange.
There was that.
Try to keep this.

20
00:01:18.281 --> 00:01:21.910
So I got like a fist from your face and perfect.
There we go.
I was with them,

21
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.740
the US marines for operation most direct,

22
00:01:23.741 --> 00:01:26.410
like the biggest operation of the Afghan war.
Um,

23
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.960
and that was a town called margin that was controlled by the Taliban.

24
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.660
And I met up with this one group of marines.

25
00:01:31.661 --> 00:01:33.080
I used to love going out of the marines because had,

26
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.440
if you were willing to run the same risks are then they'd let you film

27
00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:36.980
everything.
Um,

28
00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.840
and their mission was to get dropped by a helicopter in the middle of this town

29
00:01:40.841 --> 00:01:42.130
at 3:00 AM on day one,

30
00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.410
and then just fight their way out from the middle of the town.

31
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.570
And as soon as the sun came up,

32
00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.210
all of the speakers on the mosques were saying the infidelity here,

33
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.380
the infidels are here,
get your weapons,
get your weapons.
And General Mcchrystal,

34
00:01:53.381 --> 00:01:55.780
I didn't use this rule of courageous restraint saying,

35
00:01:55.781 --> 00:01:58.750
you're not allowed to shoot unless your shutter or unless you see someone

36
00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.470
preparing a hostile act.
And the Taliban had figured out how to use this.

37
00:02:02.471 --> 00:02:07.471
So I'm sitting in this field with about 28 marines watching the Taliban drop

38
00:02:07.761 --> 00:02:08.081
off,

39
00:02:08.081 --> 00:02:12.310
guys in buildings all around us with their weapons wrapped in blankets knowing

40
00:02:12.311 --> 00:02:16.210
the marines can't shoot them.
So they're setting up the perfect ambush.

41
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.240
Um,
and as soon as we started walking across the field,

42
00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.310
it started and it's like nothing I've ever heard or experienced before.

43
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.130
We ran and dived into a ditch.
The guys either side of me got,
got hit,

44
00:02:27.131 --> 00:02:29.860
one of them badly.
The guy was killed on the other side of the field,

45
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.170
almost straight away.
Um,

46
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.320
I was there alone filming it and myself and because I was watching the whole

47
00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:39.190
thing through this tiny little screen on my camera,
it felt like I wasn't,

48
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.400
you know,
in,
in as much dangerous as they were.

49
00:02:42.401 --> 00:02:46.000
And I was so afraid and the adrenaline runs out after a while and you just

50
00:02:46.001 --> 00:02:48.970
become numb and you,
I mean,
then I'd resigned myself.

51
00:02:48.971 --> 00:02:50.020
I thought we all going to get killed.

52
00:02:50.021 --> 00:02:54.040
We were completely surrounded in that number now RPGs and snipers.
Um,

53
00:02:54.041 --> 00:02:56.750
and I watched it back and the footage is pretty good,
you know,

54
00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.930
like changing shirts,
I'm zooming in and focusing on,

55
00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.340
I think focusing on that helped me,
helped me,
you know.
How did you get out of it?

56
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.920
I mean,
to this day,
I'm not even sure.

57
00:03:05.921 --> 00:03:10.090
I think the marines just started identifying Taliban targets and picking them

58
00:03:10.091 --> 00:03:13.720
off.
And then the Taliban ran out of ammunition and the actual ambush lasted like

59
00:03:13.721 --> 00:03:17.100
six,
seven hours of nonstop fighting.
Yeah.

60
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.260
And then we ran into an old building,
which is,

61
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.410
which became their base for six months,
just in an abandoned building.

62
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.130
And they shelled that all night.
And the fight and carried on the whole next day.

63
00:03:27.131 --> 00:03:30.490
But,
but that first day in the ditch,
I remember saying to myself,
you're an idiot.

64
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.940
You never say no to anything.
You always just,
you know,

65
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.880
join up and sign up for these insane trips.

66
00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.270
And if you survive today and you're probably not going to survive if you do

67
00:03:40.271 --> 00:03:44.310
survive today,
don't ever go out with these idiots ever again.
Um,

68
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.480
and the next day they said,
oh,
we're going to launch this operation,

69
00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.350
take this mosque.
And I went out with them all over again.

70
00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.530
It's felt like a good night's sleep.
Yeah.
When he was even a good night's sleep.

71
00:03:53.531 --> 00:03:56.200
But yeah.
But yeah,
once you survive,
a few of you,
I mean,

72
00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.950
I remember when I started doing this,
you had an idea of what,

73
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.730
what good odds and bad we'll odds were and that you know,

74
00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.480
you're willing to accept lesser and lesser odds as time goes on because nothing

75
00:04:07.481 --> 00:04:09.870
happens in it's,
it's easy to get,
to get careless and stupid.

76
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.120
<v 2>Great.
That's a real thing with violence,
right.</v>

77
00:04:13.121 --> 00:04:16.300
Until you've actually experienced it firsthand,

78
00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:18.880
personally being enacted on yourself,

79
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.050
it almost doesn't seem real even when bullets that sipping bio head.
Yeah.

80
00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.730
Is that a just a weird compartmentalization thing that people are capable of?

81
00:04:27.731 --> 00:04:28.564
Is that what it is?

82
00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.200
<v 0>I think it is.
I mean,
I think with me it's slightly different.
Um,
I mean I,</v>

83
00:04:33.201 --> 00:04:37.270
I took part in this Mtma therapy for PTSD recently and one of the,

84
00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.850
one of the revelations that came out as a result of that was I,

85
00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.920
I got into this 20 years ago thinking I could help people in Syria,
Palestine,

86
00:04:45.921 --> 00:04:46.670
Congo,
wherever,

87
00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.960
by raising awareness about about what's happening after a while you lose faith

88
00:04:50.961 --> 00:04:54.110
in the idea.
So then you start feeling a bit guilty and thinking,

89
00:04:54.111 --> 00:04:56.150
am I just here for my own benefit?

90
00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.500
Am I just here to profit in some way and not actually helping whatsoever?
Um,

91
00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.300
so I think that guilt made me think you're not important enough to have

92
00:05:05.301 --> 00:05:08.790
something as dramatic as getting shot or blown up.
It happened to you through,

93
00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.960
I know that sounds so stupid and never thought that until,
you know,

94
00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.760
it came out as part of this therapy,

95
00:05:13.761 --> 00:05:16.700
but I think I really had started thinking that.

96
00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:17.481
<v 2>So the,</v>

97
00:05:17.481 --> 00:05:22.481
the MTMA therapy made you sort of look at your rational perspective.

98
00:05:24.741 --> 00:05:29.180
Like what,
what,
how are you rationalizing your,
your time in these very,

99
00:05:29.181 --> 00:05:32.810
very dangerous places in,
in ways that I hadn't even thought about.

100
00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.510
It was going on in your subconscious.
It was sort of absolute.
Yeah.

101
00:05:35.511 --> 00:05:39.470
You're sort of making these agreements and arrangements in order to be able to

102
00:05:39.471 --> 00:05:44.330
still do that.
Yeah.
And if,
if it continued then it was going to end bad coffee.

103
00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.460
Thank you.
Like you know,
there was,

104
00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:49.010
there was only one way it was going to end and I hadn't,

105
00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:50.960
I hadn't seen that coming at all.
I hadn't,

106
00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:55.940
hadn't connected the dots like that at all.
How did you wind up stopping?
Cheers.

107
00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.073
Cheers.

108
00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.910
<v 0>I mean this is the biggest,</v>

109
00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:00.880
I haven't stopped and I don't think I'm going to stop.
I,

110
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.880
I did the EMDR therapy thinking this would give me an excuse to stop.
Right.

111
00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.110
I thought that's what I wanted.

112
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.950
Three quarters of the way through the first session I was planning the next two

113
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.860
programming.
I mean,
people say you're an adrenaline junkie.

114
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.140
That's not true at all.
It's not a thrill to be there.

115
00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:18.170
It's horrible to be there as an endurance test every single time.

116
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.020
But I still think it's,
it's important.

117
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:24.440
Do you think it's important because the information that you can get to people,

118
00:06:24.441 --> 00:06:26.570
there's no other way they can get it.
Yeah.

119
00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.840
I mean I wonder what impact that has these days.
Um,

120
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.260
but you hope that it doesn't impact or everything has an impact.

121
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:37.040
I'm sure it has an impact,
but I mean,
the example I was using this,
you know,

122
00:06:37.041 --> 00:06:39.770
some of my colleagues have been broken by this is,
is,
you know,

123
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:41.900
the Syrian war has been very well covered.

124
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.240
Every crime has been very well documented,
you know,

125
00:06:44.241 --> 00:06:47.540
often with video footage of exactly the crime being carried out.

126
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.330
Has it made any difference whatsoever?
I'm not sure.

127
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.440
The Syrian one is one where you hear,

128
00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:59.770
you hear rational people say that like Assad is not our enemy and that well,

129
00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:02.360
how do you,
what do you feel about that?

130
00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:07.460
I mean I think we're dealing with the legacy of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars in

131
00:07:07.461 --> 00:07:10.850
that even if you want to help,
what's the point?
You can't,

132
00:07:10.851 --> 00:07:13.390
you're only going to make it worse.
I think a lot of people feel that when,

133
00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:17.120
I think that leads some people to think Assad is not a good guy.

134
00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:20.090
He probably does have the blood of hundreds of thousands on his hands,

135
00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.360
but we should deal with them anyway because that's better than Iraq or

136
00:07:23.361 --> 00:07:24.180
Afghanistan.

137
00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:29.180
This is because when we do get rid of a leader like Libya with Kaddafi or Iraq

138
00:07:29.831 --> 00:07:31.400
rack with Hussein,

139
00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:36.470
that what happens is you get this power vacuum and then it becomes far worse.

140
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:40.820
We've tried every model.
We've tried invading Afghanistan,
taking you over,

141
00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:44.510
trying to rebuild the entire culture and armed forces and government ourselves

142
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:48.340
that has failed miserably.
Tried Iraq,
Libya,

143
00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:51.980
tried leading from the back.
Um,
you know,
limited intervention,

144
00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:55.760
hoping that the guys on the ground could do the fighting for us.
And then Syria,

145
00:07:55.761 --> 00:08:00.170
we've tried almost no intervention whatsoever.
Um,
and all three have failed.

146
00:08:00.171 --> 00:08:01.540
So I think now you've got people,
I mean,

147
00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:05.180
the thing I always think most people would say we should have intervened in

148
00:08:05.181 --> 00:08:08.960
Rwanda.
I think almost everyone would say,
I mean,

149
00:08:08.961 --> 00:08:11.550
Bill Clinton would say that's his biggest regret.
I think in his presence,
he,

150
00:08:11.551 --> 00:08:13.670
most people would say,
we should have intervened in Rwanda.

151
00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:17.390
I think if her window happened tomorrow,
you'd have a lot of people here saying,

152
00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:20.960
it's not worth it.
We won't help.
We can't make the situation better.

153
00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:24.400
So why even try?
Well,

154
00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:28.490
it's so hard when you look at the rest of the world and you see these horrific

155
00:08:28.491 --> 00:08:32.660
conditions and you see warlords and power and you see atrocities being
committed,

156
00:08:32.661 --> 00:08:35.110
and we're sitting over here and you know,

157
00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:40.130
in the valley watching it on Internet and drinking Starbucks,

158
00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:44.020
you know,
oh,
it's just Trump gossip.
Yeah.
I mean,

159
00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:48.800
more so American American foreign coverage was never,
was never great.
No.

160
00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:52.820
Now it's almost gone.
I mean Yemen W we'll see.

161
00:08:52.821 --> 00:08:54.620
I mean because of the [inaudible] Shoji murder may be,

162
00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:56.010
maybe something can happen with Yemen

163
00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:58.580
<v 2>cause and there is a lot we can do there because we are,
you know,</v>

164
00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.420
directly supporting one side.

165
00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:05.580
It almost seems like what you were talking about in a far lesser extent,

166
00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:09.090
the,
the feeling that you get when you're in these war zones,

167
00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:10.560
it's almost like it's not real that you're,

168
00:09:10.561 --> 00:09:14.310
you're covering it through this lens so you're immune from it.

169
00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:19.610
It almost feels like we view the massive conflicts of the world that way.

170
00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:22.470
That like we're watching it on television,

171
00:09:22.471 --> 00:09:26.070
we're seeing it on our phones or our laptops.
It's not,
it's real.

172
00:09:26.071 --> 00:09:28.200
I know it's real.
It is.
It's a real issue.

173
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:31.550
But it's not real like in terms of it's not knocking on my door.
Yeah.
No,

174
00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:35.310
it's almost like we feel about it that way.
Yeah.
And the numbers as well.
I mean,

175
00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:39.180
you know,
in Syria it could be 800,000 dead,
um,

176
00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:41.160
that people already think what,
what that means.

177
00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.740
What does 800,000 dead actually mean?
Right.
Did they,

178
00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:49.470
when I think with certain numbers,
you,
you just,
they just become a,

179
00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:53.770
it just becomes digits and it just doesn't make sense.
Yeah.
It doesn't,
uh,

180
00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:56.910
you like if you hear five guys get killed in a shootout,
you go,
ah,

181
00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:59.460
there's five guys are dead.
Yeah.
You start thinking about it,

182
00:09:59.461 --> 00:10:03.420
you hear 500,000 people died on the other side of the planet.
It's almost,

183
00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:07.560
it almost doesn't register.
Yeah.
But for you it registers.

184
00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:10.770
Yeah.
Yeah.
And you know what I mean,
the reason I started doing this,
you know,

185
00:10:10.771 --> 00:10:13.710
when I was a kid,
as soon as I started reading about these situations and,

186
00:10:13.711 --> 00:10:16.620
and you know,
when I,
when I,
I remember reading that in my government,

187
00:10:16.621 --> 00:10:18.600
the British government was arming,
you know,

188
00:10:18.601 --> 00:10:21.330
often the wrong side in these conflicts.
I remember thinking,

189
00:10:21.331 --> 00:10:23.100
how is this not front page news,
right?

190
00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:25.380
How everyone not talking about this every single day.

191
00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:28.950
And I still feel like that now even though I'm clearly out of step with,

192
00:10:28.951 --> 00:10:32.520
you know,
most of the population,
but well,
you were so immersed.

193
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:36.390
Is it hard for you when you come back and you see the Trump gossip and all the

194
00:10:36.391 --> 00:10:39.420
nonsense and all the things that we engage in on a daily basis here in America

195
00:10:39.421 --> 00:10:42.810
that are really trivial at best.
I mean,
you know,

196
00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.170
is it hard for you to,
I mean,
you mean you,

197
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:51.090
you get to see the worst shit happening in the world all the time.

198
00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:56.160
Is it hard for you to relate?
Yeah.
And then you,
you,
you know,
I mean,
one of the,

199
00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:58.180
one of the main symptoms I had of,

200
00:10:58.181 --> 00:11:00.600
of the PTSD from covering this for so long was,

201
00:11:00.601 --> 00:11:03.360
was it was numbness to physical danger when I was there,

202
00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:07.980
but it was numbness when I got back home.
So you'd come back and you know,

203
00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:09.870
at one point you used to think,
if I come back with,

204
00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:11.970
with the footage I have of whatever conflict,

205
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.410
it's going to have some kind of impact.

206
00:11:13.411 --> 00:11:17.520
It's going to create some kind of ripple and then you come back and you think

207
00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:19.470
that's going to be,
there's gonna be nothing.

208
00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.780
The film's going to go out as a few people are going to tweet.

209
00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:24.450
A few people are gonna,
you know,
send me a message.
That's it.

210
00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:29.370
Are we in a information overload state?
I mean you,

211
00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:33.450
you,
if you go back to the early days of the Internet,
Facebook,

212
00:11:33.451 --> 00:11:38.430
it was going to be the free flow of information.
You know,
no borders.
It's,
I mean,

213
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:42.210
I don't think we,
you can doubt it's made us dumber now that the infant,
there's,

214
00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.490
there's so much.
It is not just how much there is,

215
00:11:44.491 --> 00:11:47.160
it's also how much bad stuff yeah.

216
00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:50.280
Gets traction and how much really important stuff doesn't get traction.
I mean,

217
00:11:50.281 --> 00:11:54.010
one of the great things about,
about the Trump era is some of the best writing,

218
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:59.040
<v 3>you know,
I think for for years,
but how many people are reading it,
right?</v>

219
00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:02.680
Yeah.
I would like to know how many people read Matt Taibbi is articles.
Yeah.

220
00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:04.980
From the beginning to the end.
Yeah.
Yeah.

221
00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:08.110
I really would like to see them that when you think about the amount of time

222
00:12:08.111 --> 00:12:10.760
that guy puts into an article.
Yeah.

223
00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:16.330
It's such a strange time because it doesn't,
it doesn't seem like any other time.

224
00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.990
It doesn't seem like any other time in terms of our consumption of information

225
00:12:19.991 --> 00:12:24.980
or how much information we consume me.
And it's like the,

226
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.110
the,
the sheer volume of it is,
it's almost,

227
00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:33.100
it's almost a insurmountable,

228
00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:37.390
like the sheer volume of data that comes in everyday.
It doesn't go away.
It just,

229
00:12:37.391 --> 00:12:41.710
new data comes in,
it just keeps coming in and piling up.
You know,
it's like porn,

230
00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:45.550
right?
Like you never could watch all the porns yeah,
it does.

231
00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:49.210
It's not possible like,
but they keep making them.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

232
00:12:49.211 --> 00:12:53.380
And like,
ah,
you open up porn hub and you go,
what the f how many of them,

233
00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:58.330
how many of them are there?
Yeah.
And that's,
you know,
that is really data.

234
00:12:58.690 --> 00:12:59.170
I mean,

235
00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:04.170
but then all these crazy internet videos and stories and there's just every day

236
00:13:04.271 --> 00:13:07.330
it's something new.
It's constant.
But,
but you'd have thought that would,

237
00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:11.370
that would have led to a situation where some things are indisputable because,

238
00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:15.670
because there is video evidence,
but,
but it's the opposite of the case.

239
00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:19.210
Nothing is verifiable now.
No matter how much evidence exists,

240
00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:24.240
my concern is that that's leading into this trend of deep fakes and this new

241
00:13:24.611 --> 00:13:27.730
audio editing ability that they have to,

242
00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.920
they can take your voice and your,

243
00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:34.580
your mouth and put some stuff in there that you never said.
Yeah.
And you know,

244
00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:39.110
it could be news.
I mean,
you could do that.
It could be a sod.
It could be a Obama,

245
00:13:39.111 --> 00:13:39.944
it could be anyone.

246
00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:43.660
It's so strange and it might get debunked in the New York Times the next day.

247
00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:46.290
No one cares how many people are reading that.
Very few even aware of it.
Yeah.

248
00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:48.850
Very few.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Everything that's taken out of context.

249
00:13:48.851 --> 00:13:53.080
No one reads the full context.
Anything that is a,
a small video clip.

250
00:13:53.081 --> 00:13:55.660
No one's going to see the full thing.
And I think that's what what Trump,

251
00:13:55.661 --> 00:13:56.494
his masters.

252
00:13:56.890 --> 00:13:59.590
He doesn't care if he gets taken upon the next day and the New Yorker,

253
00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:01.270
he knows his base aren't reading the New Yorker.

254
00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:02.650
They don't even aware of that article.

255
00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:05.560
Well it doesn't seem to be bothering him either.

256
00:14:05.561 --> 00:14:10.561
He's one of the rare guys I've been paying attention to him a lot over the last

257
00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:14.800
few months.
He doesn't seem to be getting older like a lot of them do.

258
00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:19.600
Like it's the concern that makes them old,
you know,

259
00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:22.960
it's the stress of the job that makes them all,
he seems to be sleeping in late.

260
00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:26.410
I got traveling and I come back and I read the headlines.
You know,

261
00:14:26.411 --> 00:14:29.890
Trump's having a meltdown screaming in the White House and I seen him on TV.

262
00:14:29.891 --> 00:14:33.220
It looks as happy as a pig in shit.
I don't believe any of that shit they write.

263
00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:35.500
I think they write things like that,
I think yells at people.

264
00:14:35.501 --> 00:14:39.190
But I think yelled at people when he was a real estate mogul.
I mean,
I think,

265
00:14:39.191 --> 00:14:43.240
you know,
he wants to get shit done.
He's a billionaire.
He likes progress.

266
00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:46.540
He likes to make money.
He doesn't like in competence yells at people.

267
00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:49.540
I Dunno man.
It's just,
it's,

268
00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:54.590
I feel like we're at this cusp of something very strange happening.

269
00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.390
Like we're in the middle of it right now,

270
00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:01.250
but we're at the cusp of something very strange where all would take is one

271
00:15:01.251 --> 00:15:03.860
massive world event,
one Matt,
to,

272
00:15:03.861 --> 00:15:08.210
to completely remap how we view each other and how we view things.

273
00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:10.390
It's very disconcerting

274
00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:13.930
<v 0>this,
it feels like without that one big world event,</v>

275
00:15:13.931 --> 00:15:15.780
we're not that far away from that right now.

276
00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:19.210
There are parallel universes right now exist on things that you would have

277
00:15:19.211 --> 00:15:23.590
thought everyone can accept as a basic fact.
Like what,
you know,
um,

278
00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:28.140
uh,
I mean,
Syria.
Yeah.
You know,
the white helmets there,

279
00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:31.810
there are some fairly serious people saying the white helmets are,
you know,

280
00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:34.800
some kind of media front for alk hydro on.
There's,

281
00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:37.840
would you explain the White Helmets for people?
So when there's a,

282
00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:39.580
when there's a bombing and a building collapses,

283
00:15:39.581 --> 00:15:42.940
they go in and drag people out and get them medical attention as quick as

284
00:15:42.941 --> 00:15:43.774
possible.

285
00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:48.820
And people think that they're somehow or another involved in it through a front

286
00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:50.390
yeah.
To,
to,
and,
and the,

287
00:15:50.391 --> 00:15:54.760
the footage is faked in order to drum up sympathy for the rebel held areas.

288
00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:59.980
I mean,
that's,
I've,
I've heard,
you know,
serious people say that.
Serious people.

289
00:15:59.981 --> 00:16:03.680
Yeah.
Not,
not,
not loons on Facebook.
I've heard,
you know,
journalists are,
yeah.

290
00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:05.560
Yeah.
Um,
yeah.
I mean,
I mean,

291
00:16:05.561 --> 00:16:08.140
Seymour Hersh I think has walked it back a little bit since,

292
00:16:08.141 --> 00:16:10.600
but he said that in the early days.
Why do you think he believed it?

293
00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:14.530
I read a really interesting article about him just a few days ago.
Where was it?

294
00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:17.560
Um,
I forget what it was.
It was,
you know,

295
00:16:17.561 --> 00:16:21.460
the expos ava a really good look at,
look at,
look at him.

296
00:16:21.461 --> 00:16:25.450
And I think he's just spent his career believing rightly that the government

297
00:16:25.451 --> 00:16:29.440
lies about all kinds of things.
And that's got me into a point where he thinks,

298
00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:32.550
well,
they always lie no matter what.
So,

299
00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:37.810
and it's happened to a lot of journalists.
So Robert Fisk see more harsh,
um,

300
00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:40.660
Martha Gellhorn.
I mean,
one of my favorite war correspondents of all time,

301
00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:43.250
I reread some of her stuff recently and,

302
00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:47.320
and the first batch of war reporting she did I think is the best war reporting

303
00:16:47.321 --> 00:16:50.800
I've ever read.
Spanish civil war Vietnam.
Um,

304
00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:54.340
and then she spent 25 years writing novels and then later on wrote about,

305
00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:58.690
I believe it was the Yom Kippur War and was denying that massacre had happened

306
00:16:58.691 --> 00:17:00.790
and saying,
you know,
Arabs,
like they always lie.

307
00:17:00.791 --> 00:17:04.320
There was no massacre and we now know there was a massacre or they weren't

308
00:17:04.321 --> 00:17:08.620
massacres,
um,
in the aftermath of these,
of these wars.
Um,

309
00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:11.350
so I don't know what happens.
I mean,
maybe if you just do this for too long,

310
00:17:11.351 --> 00:17:16.150
you just become so cynical that you're open to these things,
but it's,

311
00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:19.090
yeah,
I'm amazed at Seymour Hersh is,
is open to that idea

312
00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:23.220
<v 3>when the very people that are calling it,</v>

313
00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:26.950
the very people that have boots on the ground and that are in these war zones or

314
00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:31.600
an calling,
these things,
when they become cynical and they become jaded,

315
00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:34.280
that's when it gets really,
really sketchy.
And,

316
00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:39.330
and we rely so heavily on people like it.
Like there's no,

317
00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:43.390
I'm not going over there.
You know,
Jamie's not going over there,
look at them.

318
00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:48.700
You know what I'm saying?
I mean in,
and you wouldn't be able to really get like,

319
00:17:48.701 --> 00:17:51.000
I know people that have gone to Venezuela and they come back and they go,

320
00:17:51.001 --> 00:17:53.400
I don't know what the fuck is going on over there.
I don't know who to believe.

321
00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:54.263
I don't understand it.

322
00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:58.340
If Venezuela is a very strange one and I get messages all the time and um,

323
00:17:58.380 --> 00:17:58.591
you know,

324
00:17:58.591 --> 00:18:01.920
I've had Abby Martin who goes over there and she has one take on it and I have

325
00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:04.890
other people that I've talked to that have a different take on it and I do not

326
00:18:04.891 --> 00:18:06.390
know.
I don't know who to believe.

327
00:18:06.391 --> 00:18:11.040
And I think you'd have to go over there and do [inaudible] spent a lot of time

328
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:14.280
to try to figure this out and he would have to be the entire focus of your life

329
00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:15.810
to really try to Parse it out.

330
00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:19.490
<v 0>I think that's true of a lot of conflicts.
I mean,
one of the,
one of the,</v>

331
00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:22.970
one of the drawbacks of doing what I do is I'm covering seven or eight things at

332
00:18:22.971 --> 00:18:25.580
once.
So I feel like I'm not expert enough.

333
00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:26.840
And even Afghanistan where I've covered,

334
00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:28.910
I've covered that more than any other and,
but,

335
00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:30.670
but Venezuela is an interesting one cause it's,
there's,

336
00:18:30.671 --> 00:18:33.710
there's such a left right divide on that.
And if you support the opposition,

337
00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:36.680
then you find yourself alongside John Bolton and Donald Trump,

338
00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:41.040
which means that a lot of people are,
can automatically attack you.
Right.
Um,

339
00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:45.350
automatically,
even if it's correct.
And I think it's,
you know,

340
00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:48.890
we can say without a doubt the Maduro has destroyed the economy there.

341
00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:53.090
Maduro has,
uh,
imprisoned,
beaten,
killed journalists.
Um,

342
00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:57.080
there is a movement there that do want genuine elections.
Um,

343
00:18:57.140 --> 00:18:58.910
but some people will say,
well,

344
00:18:58.911 --> 00:19:03.050
just because George Bush and other area or John Bolton and this era support the

345
00:19:03.051 --> 00:19:05.990
opposition,
therefore the opposition must be illegitimate.

346
00:19:05.991 --> 00:19:08.390
And the information coming out must be,
must be folks.

347
00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:14.630
And I wish people did rely on,
on people who actually went there,

348
00:19:14.631 --> 00:19:17.420
but it doesn't feel like that.
It feels like they rely on the,
you know,

349
00:19:17.421 --> 00:19:20.690
the guy behind the glass desk on the,
on the news when they were allowed opinion,

350
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:22.220
the people who were actually there,

351
00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:24.550
<v 3>well we still have this idea in our head that the,</v>

352
00:19:24.551 --> 00:19:29.120
the person who's reading the news is the authority and the Don Lemon has the

353
00:19:29.121 --> 00:19:31.960
inside scoop or whoever it is.
You know,

354
00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:35.860
<v 0>and I think it used to be that those guys would spend 20 or 30 years traveling</v>

355
00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:39.070
and then they'd get the cushy job behind the glass desk in the studio.

356
00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:42.730
Now it seems like you can go straight to the cushy job behind the glass desk.

357
00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:46.420
Well,
did we just need someone who's relatable,

358
00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:50.980
who can read a teleprompter,
you know,
who fits the profile they're looking for,

359
00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:55.060
whether it's Fox News or CNN,
you know,
and also the information is there.

360
00:19:55.061 --> 00:19:57.430
You know,
there are a fantastic documentaries,

361
00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:00.880
articles being written about all of these conflicts.
People aren't reading them

362
00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:07.440
<v 3>well with something like Venezuela that the real problem is you have two sides.</v>

363
00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:12.860
If two different versions of what's happening and it's,
if you're,

364
00:20:12.861 --> 00:20:16.940
if you're not educated in that country and you don't understand their politics,

365
00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:20.750
it's very difficult to figure out who's telling the truth.
Yeah.
Same in Syria.

366
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.440
Yeah.
Yeah.
And you know,
I,

367
00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:28.180
I,
I agree with you that I don't,

368
00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:32.910
I don't necessarily think we're getting stupider or dumber in this country or in

369
00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:34.310
the world in general because of the Internet,

370
00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:39.820
but we're definitely getting weirder in our perceptions of actual world events.

371
00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:44.960
And I think,
um,
every time something had like mass shootings,
for instance,

372
00:20:44.961 --> 00:20:49.030
like New Zealand,
every time one of these tragedies takes place,

373
00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:53.800
you see more and more division as I watch people fight over it on Twitter,

374
00:20:53.801 --> 00:20:58.570
people blaming leftwing people,
people blaming right wing people,

375
00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:01.450
people trying to find some reason.

376
00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:06.660
And this one is particularly disturbing because it,

377
00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:11.260
it appears that at least one of the guys,
I don't know their names,

378
00:21:11.261 --> 00:21:12.570
I don't know if they even released,
uh,

379
00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:15.340
have they withheld the names of these guys who have done this?

380
00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:19.660
I haven't seen the names.
I fought in it.
One of them seems like he's trolling.

381
00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:20.410
Like he,

382
00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:25.410
he thanked Pewdie Pie and instead that Candice Owens was as big as inspiration

383
00:21:25.841 --> 00:21:29.320
and he's doing that.
I guess we could agree.

384
00:21:29.321 --> 00:21:32.560
Some people are saying that that,
okay sign is a white power side.

385
00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:35.380
I know we had this dispute with Tim Pool where he was saying,

386
00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:39.070
I guess it is a game that some people do play.
What does it call the game?

387
00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:41.590
The look,
I don't know if there's an official name.

388
00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:44.470
There's some game where if you look under the table you see someone doing that.

389
00:21:44.471 --> 00:21:46.750
There are a lot of punch you or something.
Something stupid like that.

390
00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:50.350
I saw the Steven Miller photo where he's doing up his blazer and supposedly

391
00:21:50.351 --> 00:21:53.900
doing the white the evidence enough.
No,

392
00:21:53.901 --> 00:21:57.460
and there was a woman in court too that was doing that where she had her hand

393
00:21:57.461 --> 00:21:58.960
like this and people are saying that.

394
00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:02.740
But that's what people are talking about rather than,
right.
Which is ridiculous.

395
00:22:02.741 --> 00:22:04.690
Like Ah,
evidence,
evidence.

396
00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:09.970
But this guy in custody is clearly making that symbol clearly.

397
00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:14.820
So like what is he,
you know,
he's like some troll murderer,

398
00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:17.830
some troll mass murderer,
and he's both,

399
00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:22.810
he's both fucking with everybody and a cold blooded ruthless killer of people

400
00:22:22.811 --> 00:22:25.360
that were praying.
Yeah,
I mean I think let's not lose sight of that.

401
00:22:25.361 --> 00:22:28.750
You have to have some serious hatred to walk into a mosque and gunned down.

402
00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:31.780
He's a TTP blend.
Seven people in the other way,
you know?
That's,
yeah,

403
00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:35.740
it's horrific across the board,
top to bottom.
It's,
it's horrific.

404
00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:38.220
But it's also one of those things where like we,

405
00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:42.400
we see so many of these now that we're,
we're starting to get numb.

406
00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:47.260
Whether it's a,
a Jewish synagogue,
whether it's a,
you know,

407
00:22:47.261 --> 00:22:52.060
a Muslim temple,
whether it's a gay club where,
where whatever it is,

408
00:22:52.061 --> 00:22:56.200
it's like you see so many of these mass murders now that it's just,

409
00:22:56.201 --> 00:23:01.150
whether it's a school or a movie theater.
I'd like,
fuck man.
It's just,

410
00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:02.801
it all,

411
00:23:02.801 --> 00:23:07.801
like you were talking about when you were filming the news and you're,

412
00:23:08.291 --> 00:23:10.930
you're there,
you're watching the bullets fly by.

413
00:23:10.931 --> 00:23:15.430
You hear them fly by your head and you are just watching it through the Lens.

414
00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:17.680
We're many,
many,
many,

415
00:23:17.681 --> 00:23:22.090
many levels removed from that and we're sitting here trying to figure out what

416
00:23:22.091 --> 00:23:24.040
to do and we're not there.

417
00:23:24.041 --> 00:23:26.770
We're not where the boats and the people that are there where the bullets take

418
00:23:26.771 --> 00:23:27.430
place,

419
00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:32.430
they try to give you a description of it and even they barely can comprehend

420
00:23:33.371 --> 00:23:35.470
what happened.
But also as you said,

421
00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:37.840
we're going straight to the argument about who to blame.
Right?

422
00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:40.450
He follow rather than,
yes.

423
00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:44.200
I mean if people spend as much time as they spend arguing on Twitter reading,

424
00:23:44.410 --> 00:23:47.060
yes.
You know,
I know people say fake news,

425
00:23:47.061 --> 00:23:50.720
you know that there are people who who you can trust if they write a 10,000 word

426
00:23:50.721 --> 00:23:54.680
piece on Syria for the New Yorker for example,
like you know that they're,

427
00:23:54.681 --> 00:23:59.030
they're being fact check and maybe it would be better if there was a website

428
00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:03.650
where you,
we curated all of like the bulletproof,

429
00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:08.090
that's a terrible way to describe it.
But you know,
lock solid rock,

430
00:24:08.091 --> 00:24:13.091
solid investigative journalism's that are 100% ethical that you could completely

431
00:24:13.371 --> 00:24:16.310
rely on for an accurate assessment of what's happening.

432
00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:19.850
Because it is difficult for people and when people,

433
00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:24.350
they rely on biased websites,
which many of them do,

434
00:24:24.351 --> 00:24:27.470
whether it's biased to the left or bias to the right,
things get even more money.

435
00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:28.640
And there's so many of them.

436
00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:33.320
It's so easy to get so easy to reinforce your confirmation bias.
Wa,
Wa,

437
00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:38.000
whatever,
you know,
whether it's left wing or right wing,
just find that website,

438
00:24:38.001 --> 00:24:42.210
read the comments.
These are my people.
They think like me.
And especially now.

439
00:24:42.211 --> 00:24:43.940
I mean,
it used to be if you were conservatively in the,

440
00:24:43.941 --> 00:24:46.970
you'd read the Wall Street Journal,
a few liberal leading New York Times now,

441
00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:49.100
no matter how far off the scale you are,

442
00:24:49.101 --> 00:24:51.960
you can find a pretty professional looking website.
Yes.

443
00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:53.570
We'll write a story backing up.

444
00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:56.330
You're prejudice and people aren't looking at the story thinking,
okay,

445
00:24:56.331 --> 00:24:58.730
I'm going to find that what happened here.
Yeah.
They're thinking,

446
00:24:58.731 --> 00:25:02.630
I know what my gut feeling tells me I need to find a head,
not even a story,

447
00:25:02.631 --> 00:25:05.270
a headline that justifies my gut feeling about this.

448
00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:09.620
And that's as far as it seems to go.
Now,
you as a journalist,

449
00:25:09.621 --> 00:25:13.940
as a person who risked their life to bring this information to people,

450
00:25:13.941 --> 00:25:15.980
how does this make you feel?
I mean,

451
00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:19.100
there's this part of the reason why you needed to do that Mtma therapy,

452
00:25:19.101 --> 00:25:22.010
not just the fact that you were,
you know,
you're,

453
00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:25.700
you're really are without better useful,

454
00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:29.390
without a better term shell shocked,
right?
I mean you're,
you're there,

455
00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:31.300
you're there.
Yeah.

456
00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:34.460
There's something that comes out of that that's got to be very,

457
00:25:34.461 --> 00:25:37.730
very difficult to recover from.
And overcome.
Yeah.

458
00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:40.460
But there's also the fact that you're going over there and bringing this shit

459
00:25:40.461 --> 00:25:42.950
back and it doesn't seem to,
people don't seem to give a fuck.

460
00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:45.770
And that used to be what kept you going is as you thought,

461
00:25:45.771 --> 00:25:48.770
like some of my work is going to make some kind of difference and when that

462
00:25:48.771 --> 00:25:51.860
starts to fade and you start to think,
that's not going to happen.
That's,

463
00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:56.060
I'm sure your work makes a lot of difference to the people that pay attention to

464
00:25:56.061 --> 00:26:00.860
it.
That I think we're,
we're overwhelmed by bullshit.

465
00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:03.830
I think it's everywhere.
There's,
I know what I mean.
Bullshit.

466
00:26:03.831 --> 00:26:06.290
I mean like nonsense.
You know,

467
00:26:06.410 --> 00:26:10.340
Kim Kardashians psoriasis is in the front page of CNN or something like that.

468
00:26:10.341 --> 00:26:12.740
You know what I mean?
It's not nonsense to her,
but you know what I mean?

469
00:26:12.741 --> 00:26:14.990
Like there's,
there's stuff that people are concentrating on.

470
00:26:14.991 --> 00:26:18.290
It's like Jesus Christ.
It's,

471
00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:24.560
I mean,
yeah,
one of our,
one of our docs on Hbo,
um,
if it got 4 million views,

472
00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:28.030
I think that would be considered very good viewing figures.
Yeah.
That's China.

473
00:26:28.050 --> 00:26:31.670
The country of 360 million people.
Yeah.
Well,

474
00:26:31.671 --> 00:26:35.960
it's very difficult to get people to watch documentaries on real world events.

475
00:26:35.961 --> 00:26:39.380
You get them to watch documentaries on like a sex call from Oregon or something

476
00:26:39.381 --> 00:26:42.960
like that.
Like wow.
Wild country that probably got 10 million.
Yeah.
Yeah.

477
00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:47.430
It's just,
I don't know,
man,
you know,

478
00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:50.890
this New Zealand thing really hiding me,
rattled I,

479
00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:56.340
and you know what is also strange,
people like seem to demand a response.

480
00:26:56.550 --> 00:26:57.930
They'd demand,
um,

481
00:26:58.050 --> 00:27:01.700
people in the public eye to talk about it and you know,

482
00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:03.810
say thoughts and prayers or something like that.

483
00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:07.530
But as soon as you say thoughts and prayers,
they'll say they'll go crazy egg.

484
00:27:07.531 --> 00:27:11.280
We had that for years and that's actually happened.
It's,
yeah.
Yeah.
It's um,

485
00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:16.080
it's very strict,
but like,
like I don't know if they,

486
00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:20.850
they're concerned that you're not horrified.
They want to make sure you are like,

487
00:27:20.851 --> 00:27:24.630
who the fuck isn't,
like,
how could you not be,
I don't understand this.

488
00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:28.440
Or is it just,
they're just frustrated,
confused themselves.

489
00:27:28.441 --> 00:27:32.460
So just lashing out at any target they can find or anyone they can find.

490
00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:36.770
<v 0>And also,
you know,
I mean I know the footage is available of,
of,
you know,</v>

491
00:27:36.771 --> 00:27:39.620
this guy's head cam as he,
as he shot everybody,
but,

492
00:27:39.621 --> 00:27:44.240
but footage like that has been widely available for a long time now and I think

493
00:27:44.241 --> 00:27:46.560
that's,
that's had a massive,
nothing effect.
I mean,
you know,
the,

494
00:27:46.561 --> 00:27:50.330
the picture of the Syrian refugee washing up on the beach,
you know,

495
00:27:50.331 --> 00:27:52.550
it felt like that was going to have an effect.

496
00:27:52.551 --> 00:27:56.660
It felt like that was the picture that was really gonna gonna change things.
No,

497
00:27:56.661 --> 00:28:00.710
I'm not sure.
It did in might off for a couple days.
Yeah.
And then more news,

498
00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:03.350
you know,
I mean not,
you know,

499
00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:08.210
just to be not completely pessimistic that when you're doing stuff for vice and

500
00:28:08.211 --> 00:28:12.440
HBO,
you do get young people reaching out to you and saying,
oh,
I had no idea.

501
00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:14.120
I don't want to be a photographer or a doctor.

502
00:28:14.121 --> 00:28:18.230
Or maybe that's an effect that's going to be felt down the road.
I don't know.

503
00:28:18.231 --> 00:28:21.560
It feels like there are th th th there is a generation of people growing up

504
00:28:21.561 --> 00:28:24.650
thinking I'm not going to play by the normal set of rules like I am going to

505
00:28:24.651 --> 00:28:26.330
actually try and do something about this.

506
00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:28.670
<v 3>I think I really do believe you do have an effect.</v>

507
00:28:28.671 --> 00:28:31.610
I think vice certainly has an effect.
I think a lot of this has an effect.

508
00:28:31.611 --> 00:28:32.270
I think it's very,

509
00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:36.650
very difficult to feel that effect if you're not experiencing it personally.

510
00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:37.581
I mean to,

511
00:28:37.581 --> 00:28:40.940
to just look out onto the landscape and say how much of an effect is this having

512
00:28:40.941 --> 00:28:44.600
on people?
It's hard.
Like where are you getting the feedback from?
How you,

513
00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:47.810
how are you gauging whether or not this is changing people's perceptions?

514
00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:53.610
<v 0>Well sometimes the feedback you do get is is on Twitter we'll get,</v>

515
00:28:53.611 --> 00:28:57.690
a few lunatics will say,
oh you fake this footage.
So then you think,
wow,

516
00:28:57.700 --> 00:28:58.740
really having no impact.

517
00:28:58.741 --> 00:29:01.290
But I think that's an argument for just not reading the comments.

518
00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:03.490
<v 3>There's a little bit of that.
And then,
you know,</v>

519
00:29:03.491 --> 00:29:08.491
I had Renee duressed on recently and she's done a lot of work covering all these

520
00:29:08.711 --> 00:29:13.330
various uh,
Russian troll farms and how they,
uh,

521
00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:18.420
so how they essentially organize conflict online and you know,

522
00:29:20.531 --> 00:29:20.651
they,

523
00:29:20.651 --> 00:29:25.090
they set up these things where you have like a pro Texas movement and they set

524
00:29:25.091 --> 00:29:28.960
them up across the street from a pro Muslim movement and they do it on purpose

525
00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:34.230
and then they have these pro LGBT movement things online to day organize to

526
00:29:36.581 --> 00:29:38.710
attack certain people in certain groups,

527
00:29:38.711 --> 00:29:43.690
diminish certain aspects and defied of the Democratic Party.
It's crazy.

528
00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:46.780
Yeah.
When you hear about shit like that on top of all this,
you're like,

529
00:29:46.781 --> 00:29:50.780
well k the just the,
the actual news itself so difficult to disseminate it.

530
00:29:50.781 --> 00:29:53.800
It's so difficult to figure out what should I pay attention to,
what's real?

531
00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:57.580
And then you have this kind of shit happening on top of that.
You're like,
Whoa,

532
00:29:57.581 --> 00:29:58.660
whoa,
Whoa,
fuck.

533
00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:00.280
<v 0>You know,
I don't,
you know,</v>

534
00:30:00.281 --> 00:30:03.100
there's a piece came out in the New York and other means that you keep on going

535
00:30:03.101 --> 00:30:04.490
on about the New York about a piece came.
Matt,

536
00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:06.310
how about the New Yorker today by Ed sees it,

537
00:30:06.311 --> 00:30:09.480
a friend of mine about Brexit and about Aaron Banks and,
and,

538
00:30:09.481 --> 00:30:11.140
and I have read the piece yet,
but I know,

539
00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:13.230
I know he's been working on and you know,

540
00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:16.930
there may be evidence that the Russians directly influenced the Brexit vote.

541
00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:21.790
Are the Brexit voters really going to look at that article and think,
Oh,

542
00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:25.540
maybe I was misled.
Maybe I,
maybe I read 10 articles on Facebook that,

543
00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:28.450
that made me vote wrongly.
Eh,
you know,

544
00:30:28.451 --> 00:30:33.440
how many people actually have their minds open enough to consider that?
I mean,

545
00:30:33.550 --> 00:30:37.050
especially with American politics,
it feels like football,
you know,

546
00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:39.710
if your play a foul someone,
of course it's not a fail.

547
00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:43.870
If your player gets fouled,
I sublet foul,
he should get sent off.
It's 100%

548
00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:48.480
<v 3>blatant tribalism.
Yeah.
Very few objective people.</v>

549
00:30:48.481 --> 00:30:50.460
Very few legitimate centrists.

550
00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:55.380
Everyone seems to be digging their heels in on one side or the other and it

551
00:30:55.381 --> 00:30:59.100
seems to solve that.
A lot of them have just picked a team.
Yeah,
I don't,

552
00:30:59.101 --> 00:31:04.101
I don't necessarily think they've curated these opinions and cultivated these

553
00:31:04.381 --> 00:31:09.381
ideas over many years of soul searching and reading and trying to understand who

554
00:31:10.171 --> 00:31:13.410
they are and how they interface with the world.
I don't think that's happened.

555
00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:15.480
<v 0>Oh,
your family.
Yes.
Team.
Exactly.</v>

556
00:31:15.530 --> 00:31:18.360
If your family has always been republican suddenly saying,

557
00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:21.240
maybe I'm going to vote for Hillary or Trump feels like coming out with

558
00:31:21.241 --> 00:31:22.960
something,
you know,
like it's that big a deal.

559
00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:25.900
<v 3>Your occupation,
you know,
depending upon your occupation.
I mean,</v>

560
00:31:25.901 --> 00:31:29.650
good luck finding a job in tech if you're right wing,
you know?
Good.

561
00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:33.240
Good luck working in the arms industry if you're left wing.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's like,

562
00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:34.413
there's

563
00:31:35.390 --> 00:31:39.660
<v 0>so weird weird time,
Ben.
Yeah.
You know,
and I,
you know,
I used to,</v>

564
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.030
I always used to read about the,
uh,
the Nixon era,

565
00:31:42.031 --> 00:31:43.970
I think in that must have been a fascinating time to be alive,

566
00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:47.630
but then to actually live through a similar period,
now you're thinking it's not,

567
00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:51.500
it's not fascinating.
He's just,
it's just depressing.
Every single day.
Nixon

568
00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:56.150
<v 3>thing,
it must have been an insanely difficult to get information.
Right.</v>

569
00:31:56.820 --> 00:32:01.670
You relied on rolling stone,
New York Times,
whatever Washington Post,

570
00:32:01.671 --> 00:32:05.030
whatever newspaper was covering,
whatever store you relied on all those,

571
00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:10.940
but you,
you couldn't get it any other way.
Now you can get it from everything.

572
00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:15.500
I mean there's people on the ground that are tweeting about things and then they

573
00:32:15.501 --> 00:32:16.970
become local celebrities.

574
00:32:16.971 --> 00:32:21.590
So they become sort of like temporary internet journalist slash.
Celebrities.

575
00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:27.020
Yeah.
Fucking weird waiting when you,
you,

576
00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:28.910
your perspective and your,

577
00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:34.900
your life experience is so much richer and deeper in this than anybody else's d

578
00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:37.490
do you think there's a way to turn this around?

579
00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:40.460
Does this going to eventually

580
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.990
<v 2>even out?
I hope so.
Um,</v>

581
00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:47.600
right now I don't see what that,
what that looks like,

582
00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:51.290
what that looks like is the best way to describe it.
What does that look like?

583
00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:54.680
I mean,
you know,
my attention span I think has been shortened.
Yeah.

584
00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:57.860
I'll sit down to watch a movie at home and within 10 minutes I'm reaching for my

585
00:32:57.861 --> 00:33:02.300
phone.
Yes.
I'm not a heart surgeon.
There's no emergency that you know.
Right,

586
00:33:02.301 --> 00:33:05.580
right.
It might be just be checking Twitter again.
Um,

587
00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:11.110
so it's a perfect storm,
yeah.
Of distractions and we now know it is,

588
00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:14.390
it is addictive.
So yeah.
How you turn that around.
I,
I mean,

589
00:33:14.391 --> 00:33:17.200
it feels like there's a little bit of a movement of people to,
you know,

590
00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:21.440
switch that stuff off and just read a book or go for a walk or,
but yeah,

591
00:33:21.930 --> 00:33:24.620
you got to have real discipline now.
I mean,

592
00:33:24.621 --> 00:33:28.280
you're fighting against our fucking heroin addiction,
man.
Yeah.
It's crazy.

593
00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:30.200
And everyone else is addicted to oh yeah.

594
00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:32.360
So you're not part of the conversation if you're not,
man,

595
00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:36.320
I walked into a restaurant the other night and everyone was looking at their

596
00:33:36.321 --> 00:33:40.190
phone.
No one was looking at each other.
I'm like,
I'm in a movie.
This is a movie.

597
00:33:40.210 --> 00:33:43.160
Some poster.
Public toilets.
Some.
Yeah.
I mean if,

598
00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:46.970
if instead of looking at their phones,
if everyone was just looking at the sky,

599
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.190
you'd be like,
oh my God,
there's a real problem and these people are sick.
Yeah.

600
00:33:50.250 --> 00:33:51.670
Yeah.
Something wrong.
You know,

601
00:33:52.010 --> 00:33:54.200
if everybody's just sitting there with our hands open,

602
00:33:54.201 --> 00:33:57.590
like staring up at this guy and sitting next to each other,
you'd be like,

603
00:33:57.591 --> 00:34:00.670
these people are sick,
there's something wrong.
They need help.
Instead they're,

604
00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:04.760
they're looking at nothing.
Yeah.
They're checking their feed over and over again.

605
00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:08.480
Someone's complaining about Captain Marvel being a woman.
Yay.
Yeah.

606
00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:12.980
And all the experts are they the ones getting followed on there?
Oh,

607
00:34:13.210 --> 00:34:16.070
they're not experts and the experts in whatever,
you know,

608
00:34:16.071 --> 00:34:19.340
the ones who really are we looking at them,
you know,
it should be this,

609
00:34:19.341 --> 00:34:23.060
this free flow of information where you can find out anything in your hand.

610
00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:26.660
What an incredible thing.
Yeah.
But it's,
it's not that.

611
00:34:26.661 --> 00:34:29.630
It's definitely not that well.
I think there's two things.
I think,

612
00:34:29.631 --> 00:34:33.890
one we didn't earn it is just given to us.
Right.

613
00:34:33.891 --> 00:34:38.270
It's not like we did all the work to curate all this technology and put it

614
00:34:38.271 --> 00:34:40.640
together and figuring out how to implement it and our deal.
No,

615
00:34:40.641 --> 00:34:44.810
we just went to the fucking Verizon store and picked up a new phone.
I mean,

616
00:34:44.811 --> 00:34:49.250
that's,
that's what most people are doing.
Yeah.
And because of that,

617
00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:53.570
it's almost like being um,
like a trust fund kid or something like that.

618
00:34:53.570 --> 00:34:58.430
It's just all given to you.
It's all handed to you all this,
I felt,

619
00:34:58.431 --> 00:35:00.800
I feel the same way sometimes about weapons.

620
00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:06.370
I feel like the discipline required to learn how to use one and create it and

621
00:35:07.701 --> 00:35:12.350
build it and then understand the responsibility of actually using it on a human

622
00:35:12.351 --> 00:35:15.650
being.
All that shit's out the window.
You just go to the store and buy it.

623
00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:20.150
You know?
There's no requirements of you other than you never killed anybody yet.

624
00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:24.710
Have you written,
driven over anybody in your car?
No.
If you're robbed a bank,
no.

625
00:35:24.711 --> 00:35:28.240
Okay.
Yeah.
You beating your wife?
No.
Okay,
here.
Here's a guy.
Yeah,

626
00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:33.260
it's fucking strange.
And this as,

627
00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:35.290
as a human being,
the,

628
00:35:35.291 --> 00:35:38.570
the lack of discipline and accountability that,

629
00:35:38.571 --> 00:35:43.571
that we have in this ultimate access to all these things constantly and many of

630
00:35:44.131 --> 00:35:48.000
them become just massive distractions.
And yeah,

631
00:35:48.001 --> 00:35:49.170
this in some ways is,

632
00:35:49.171 --> 00:35:52.780
is the utopia that people have dreamed for Django for generation.
Sure.

633
00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:55.530
Free of war.
You're not going to get attacked in your house tonight,

634
00:35:55.531 --> 00:35:58.830
you're not going to starve.
You have everything you could possibly need.

635
00:35:58.831 --> 00:36:02.250
So you'd think we would become the perfect human beings and the absence will

636
00:36:02.251 --> 00:36:04.950
those things that would have killed us in the past or would have made life hard

637
00:36:04.951 --> 00:36:08.520
in the past.
Yeah.
And again,
that's that.
That's not what we're doing well.

638
00:36:08.521 --> 00:36:12.960
I don't think we operate very well without legitimate conflict,

639
00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:17.070
without legitimate conflict in terms of like actual things you need to worry

640
00:36:17.071 --> 00:36:19.920
about.
Like I,
when I used to live in the east coast,

641
00:36:19.921 --> 00:36:23.820
one of the things that was really noticeable was that when it snowed out,

642
00:36:23.821 --> 00:36:27.840
people were nicer.
They help people and they're broken down the side of the road.

643
00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:29.100
There were nice to each other.

644
00:36:29.101 --> 00:36:33.780
There was a sense of vulnerability that we were all deeply entrenched in this

645
00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:36.930
winter nature thing and we've got to work together,
otherwise we can't survive.

646
00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:38.280
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know,

647
00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:43.310
and I think that applies to all aspects of life that when there's no real

648
00:36:44.461 --> 00:36:47.670
danger,
people become extremely frivolous.
Yeah.
Yeah.

649
00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:50.520
It's amazing how quickly we become lazy and complacent.

650
00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:54.620
And actually the flip side of the negative stuff I was saying earlier,

651
00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:57.840
some good days I'll come back from Yemen,
Syria,
wherever.

652
00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:01.520
I'll go out and get a cup of coffee,
we get coffee and I'll read the newspaper.

653
00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:05.460
I'll kept donor and I'll think,
man,
I'm the luckiest man alive.
Yeah.

654
00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:07.350
The flip side,
the fact that I can do this,
this,

655
00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:11.430
you do experience these horrific environment so you can appreciate it.
Yeah.

656
00:37:11.431 --> 00:37:12.660
And the fact that we can,
you know,

657
00:37:12.661 --> 00:37:16.470
I mean within a few hours here we could have one of the best meals.
Yeah.

658
00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:19.410
Possibly in the world we could,
you know,
it's,
you know,
it's,

659
00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:22.200
that's Fetty incredible.
So on good days that you can,
you can,

660
00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:25.890
you can appreciate that.
Again,
this is you coming from these bad things,

661
00:37:25.891 --> 00:37:27.440
so it puts it in perspective.
Sorry.
Yeah,

662
00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:30.180
I was trying to try it back you up and say,
yeah,
like if you,
if you're not,

663
00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:32.460
if you're not protected and all that stuff,

664
00:37:32.461 --> 00:37:34.410
then you can get to appreciate the basics.
Again,

665
00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:37.950
I was on this trip and Prince of Wales,
we camped out on this island.

666
00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:41.700
It rained every day for six days,
seven days.

667
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.040
I mean we were soaked,
you're soaked,

668
00:37:44.041 --> 00:37:46.740
everything is soaked your sleeping bag so you tent soaked.

669
00:37:46.741 --> 00:37:51.741
Everything came back home and it felt so good.

670
00:37:51.961 --> 00:37:54.750
Like I'd never felt the sun like that before.

671
00:37:55.030 --> 00:38:00.030
Like the sun was just this like this magic love glow that the sky was pouring

672
00:38:00.241 --> 00:38:03.690
down on the city.
Everything felt so happy and I realized like,

673
00:38:04.050 --> 00:38:07.850
well you can't really appreciate this until it's taken away from you.
Yeah,

674
00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:10.410
it's taken away from you.
Then you understand what it is.

675
00:38:10.830 --> 00:38:14.380
So then you wonder when the kids of today grow up,
right.

676
00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:16.950
What are they going to be like when everything has just been at their fingertips

677
00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:19.650
from day one forever for APP,
no mystery.

678
00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:23.490
They don't understand bullshitters either because like,

679
00:38:24.210 --> 00:38:27.960
like when I was a kid,
people just a lie about shit and you really didn't know.

680
00:38:27.961 --> 00:38:30.300
You're like,
man,
I don't know.
He seems like he's full of Shit.

681
00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:33.990
You couldn't just yet.
I have to go to an encyclopedia and you know,

682
00:38:33.991 --> 00:38:38.200
and actually read the,
now you can go,
okay,
what year did this happen?

683
00:38:38.410 --> 00:38:41.590
And you pull up your phone,
get the fuck out.
You know,

684
00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:44.590
people lie about being in the Olympics,
they lied about this,

685
00:38:44.591 --> 00:38:48.860
they lied about that.
Yeah.
It's um,

686
00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:52.870
it's good in that we have ultimate access to information for people that use it

687
00:38:52.871 --> 00:38:56.230
and understand what it is and appreciate it.
It is good.
But to your point,

688
00:38:56.231 --> 00:39:00.730
if there was a way to actually filter and say this is verifiable,
this,

689
00:39:01.090 --> 00:39:04.360
this contains seven things,
which are absolutely bullshit.

690
00:39:04.361 --> 00:39:07.720
We have no doubt about that whatsoever.
If that could exist.
Wonderful.

691
00:39:07.721 --> 00:39:11.410
But I mean folks,
I've tried it.
A few people have tried it,
used to,

692
00:39:11.411 --> 00:39:13.660
it still feels like you end up being described as,
you know,

693
00:39:13.661 --> 00:39:14.740
big on one side of the fight.

694
00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:18.730
I almost feel like we need some sort of organized discipline,

695
00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:22.870
like maybe like a mandatory volunteer work,

696
00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:27.370
cleaning up impoverished communities are mandatory volunteer work doing.

697
00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:32.740
But I don't want people to have to do things like,
um,
I'm conflicted on that too.

698
00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:35.290
I don't want people to have to do that.
You know,

699
00:39:35.291 --> 00:39:37.600
like when there's countries that have mandatory military service,

700
00:39:37.601 --> 00:39:40.510
they seem to have an amazing feeling of,
uh,

701
00:39:40.530 --> 00:39:43.930
of patriotism in those countries and appreciation in those countries because

702
00:39:43.931 --> 00:39:47.510
they actually do have to join the military for two years or whatever it is
going.

703
00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:50.200
I'll have that over here.
Yeah.
Weird.

704
00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:52.450
And to your point about going up and cleaning up,

705
00:39:52.510 --> 00:39:54.130
cleaning up in an impoverished area,

706
00:39:54.131 --> 00:39:57.100
at least then you'd get to meet other people.
Yeah.

707
00:39:57.130 --> 00:39:59.260
People outside of your circle and your Bible.
I mean,

708
00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:03.470
the amount of times here when you talk to people about Muslims,
LGBT,

709
00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:04.810
whatever it is,
and you think,
oh,

710
00:40:04.811 --> 00:40:08.260
it's because you've never met anyone rise and you've actually never met anyone

711
00:40:08.350 --> 00:40:11.340
that is x,
y or zed,
which is,
um,

712
00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:14.470
I moved to Brooklyn in five years or six years ago on a move to Clinton Hill,

713
00:40:14.471 --> 00:40:17.590
Fort Greene.
I got a few friends that have been there forever and I said,
let,

714
00:40:17.591 --> 00:40:19.270
this probably sounds like a really stupid thing to say,

715
00:40:19.271 --> 00:40:23.890
but it feels kind of segregated here.
And they like,
Duh,
it costs.
It does.

716
00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:26.800
And I couldn't believe it.
You know,

717
00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:29.400
I'd grown up on the spike Lee movies and I mean,

718
00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:31.770
I guess they do show a kind of segregation by thought.
Yeah.

719
00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:35.450
This was the place where everyone lived together on the same month,

720
00:40:35.530 --> 00:40:37.210
each other's egos in restaurants.

721
00:40:37.211 --> 00:40:41.250
And I lived on the dividing line between the bit that was a gang gentrified and

722
00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:44.770
the projects you go two blocks that way,
pretty much all black.

723
00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:46.390
You got three blocks that way.

724
00:40:46.450 --> 00:40:50.500
Pretty much all white with yoga studios and Bougie coffee shops and pet spars

725
00:40:50.501 --> 00:40:53.320
and,
and the two communities just did not mix.

726
00:40:53.321 --> 00:40:57.310
It wasn't necessarily they hated each other or they just did not make different

727
00:40:57.311 --> 00:40:59.320
language,
different everything.
Right.

728
00:40:59.321 --> 00:41:02.980
This is the terpene perception that there is a place where everybody's cool.

729
00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:07.400
Yeah.
Yeah.
And I thought it might be New York,
it might be Brooklyn.
And you know,

730
00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:11.110
it's probably the only place that's close,
right?

731
00:41:11.111 --> 00:41:14.620
Like we will at least it has the reputation for it because at least in Brooklyn,

732
00:41:14.621 --> 00:41:16.950
people walk around.
I mean,
yeah.
But,

733
00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:20.020
but talking about amazing pieces of journalism over the last few years,

734
00:41:20.021 --> 00:41:23.770
there's Nicole,
Hannah Jones wrote a piece about a New York school system,

735
00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:24.640
public school system,

736
00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:29.080
the most segregated school system in America when New York really,

737
00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:31.630
and she had to get her daughter into a public school.

738
00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:36.900
And the choice was the very good well supported school in the gentrifying,

739
00:41:37.131 --> 00:41:41.450
mostly white area or the bad failing public school in the non gentrified,

740
00:41:41.451 --> 00:41:44.240
mostly black area where her kids education might suffer.

741
00:41:45.170 --> 00:41:47.060
And I think I'm remembering correct correctly,

742
00:41:47.061 --> 00:41:49.430
but her and her husband had a real fight about it cause she said,
no,

743
00:41:49.431 --> 00:41:50.470
we've got to put our kid in the,

744
00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:54.320
in the bad failing school and help it get better and it's going to take years

745
00:41:54.350 --> 00:41:56.150
and our daughter may suffer in the short term,

746
00:41:56.151 --> 00:41:59.300
but that's what we have to do if we're living in this neighborhood.
Um,

747
00:41:59.330 --> 00:42:04.160
it's an incredible piece.
Wow.
Yeah.
That's a real conflict as a pet.

748
00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:08.930
Do you have children?
No one's possible.
Yeah,
I'm sure.
Right.
You're,

749
00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:11.640
when you're thinking of your children,
you're,

750
00:42:11.641 --> 00:42:14.120
you're always thinking to their safety.
You're always worried about them.

751
00:42:14.121 --> 00:42:15.050
And you want to protect them.

752
00:42:15.051 --> 00:42:18.980
So putting them in a situation where they wouldn't be as protected is never your

753
00:42:18.981 --> 00:42:22.400
first instinct.
Oh,
she,
she was in,
in town hall meetings where,
you know,

754
00:42:22.401 --> 00:42:26.780
progressive white liberal parents who would be very left wing on every other

755
00:42:26.781 --> 00:42:27.614
issue.

756
00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:31.130
We're really fighting to make sure their kid went to the good majority white

757
00:42:31.131 --> 00:42:34.190
school.
Um,
and you know,
they want a bit of diversity but not,

758
00:42:34.250 --> 00:42:38.480
not too much diversity.
Right.
They want a black friend.
Yeah,

759
00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:42.050
yeah,
yeah.
That's when people think of Brooklyn,

760
00:42:42.051 --> 00:42:46.490
they do think of it as being like the most diverse place.
Yeah.
And it's,
yeah.

761
00:42:47.110 --> 00:42:52.070
Street by street segregated Atlanta is pretty diverse.
Atlanta is interesting,

762
00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:57.010
you know,
because Atlanta has,
um,
a lot of,
there's a,

763
00:42:57.050 --> 00:43:01.580
there's a lot of um,
pause a lot of everything in Atlanta,

764
00:43:01.610 --> 00:43:04.340
but it's,
it's a very black city and a lot of ways,

765
00:43:04.341 --> 00:43:05.660
but it's also a very white city.

766
00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:09.890
You see a lot of black and white people hanging out together and clubs and bars

767
00:43:09.891 --> 00:43:13.880
and restaurants and stuff and it's really like much closer to like a 50,

768
00:43:13.881 --> 00:43:15.560
50 split.
Then a lot of places,

769
00:43:15.930 --> 00:43:17.780
at least in some of the neighborhoods that I've been to,

770
00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:21.530
when I got back to London,
this was one of the few things I'm proud of about,

771
00:43:21.590 --> 00:43:23.820
about London.
Yes.
He certainly New York,
it,

772
00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:27.650
it's not a big deal for a group of friends,
a family,
and kind of to be,

773
00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:30.470
to be genuinely mixed his sites that

774
00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:33.510
you would know.
Um,

775
00:43:33.770 --> 00:43:38.510
I'd ask you is that because London didn't experience slavery the way the United

776
00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:42.410
States did?
Um,
yeah.
I mean obviously we have,
you know,

777
00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:44.930
colonial history,
right?
Of course.

778
00:43:44.931 --> 00:43:48.260
But that wasn't in the country itself for a very long time.

779
00:43:48.261 --> 00:43:52.910
We've had a huge Pakistani Bangladeshi,
Jamaican community and it's,
it's,

780
00:43:52.911 --> 00:43:54.170
you know,
I mean here,

781
00:43:54.171 --> 00:43:57.860
if you have black friends or you date a black girl or you know,
it's,
it's,

782
00:43:57.980 --> 00:44:02.300
people think you're trying to prove your work right there.
It was just normal,

783
00:44:02.330 --> 00:44:05.150
normal,
say London.
I'm not saying England's person in London.

784
00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:07.700
I experienced that when I was in London as well.

785
00:44:07.701 --> 00:44:11.930
It seemed like way more integrated.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That,

786
00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:15.050
and that's still five,
six years after I moved to New York.
It's,
it's,

787
00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:18.770
there's still a surprise every day to reinforce a different animal.

788
00:44:18.771 --> 00:44:23.320
Now New York is so fucking expensive.
It's so strange.
And,
uh,

789
00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:27.380
my friend,
uh,
Judah,
Judah Freelander who lives there,
so he's,

790
00:44:27.590 --> 00:44:30.710
he's lived there for a long time.
He's like,
it's so changed.

791
00:44:30.711 --> 00:44:34.680
It used be like a lot of artists and a lot of creative people and he goes this

792
00:44:34.681 --> 00:44:37.200
now it's all finance people.
Like every,
you go to finance,

793
00:44:37.650 --> 00:44:40.950
everybody just wants the most expensive suit and the most expensive watch and

794
00:44:40.951 --> 00:44:43.950
they live in this ridiculously expensive apartment.

795
00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:46.170
And I thought that went out in the 80s.

796
00:44:46.171 --> 00:44:50.900
I thought that was like Wall Street Americain that's still very much exist.

797
00:44:50.901 --> 00:44:52.160
That's still prevalent.
Well,

798
00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:57.470
I was talking to this guy yesterday who was a 26 year old who's graduating with

799
00:44:58.651 --> 00:45:01.350
a degree in finance and trying to figure out what he wants to do and he's

800
00:45:01.351 --> 00:45:03.750
thinking about moving to New York and getting a job in Wall Street,

801
00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:08.340
but he's hesitant cause he's a nice guy.
He doesn't want to go dark,
you know?

802
00:45:08.341 --> 00:45:13.200
And I'm like,
it could,
you could go to the dark side.
Like these people are,

803
00:45:13.770 --> 00:45:18.270
look,
not all of them,
but a lot of them are just straight up materialists.

804
00:45:18.271 --> 00:45:19.680
They're just chasing money.

805
00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:23.130
When you're in the money business and you're just chasing money,

806
00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:27.240
like there's your reward is things.

807
00:45:27.330 --> 00:45:32.330
Your award is objects and status and clothes and houses and shit.

808
00:45:34.650 --> 00:45:37.500
Yeah.
And sometimes you talk to those guys and you say,
so what?
What do you do?

809
00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:41.730
I work in finance.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But what do you actually do?
Work in finance.

810
00:45:41.731 --> 00:45:45.450
And I'm very well rewarded,
as you can see.
Yeah.
But what do you actually do?

811
00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:50.390
I look for fluctuations in international grain markets.
Oh,
congratulations.

812
00:45:50.391 --> 00:45:52.530
What an amazing thing to dedicate your life to him.
You know?

813
00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:55.760
And if you just said what they do rather than what the reward was,
right.

814
00:45:55.830 --> 00:45:59.790
I think this is ridiculous.
What a waste of your time it is.

815
00:45:59.790 --> 00:46:04.200
But the,
the status of being super wealthy,

816
00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:08.550
for a lot of them,
it's worth it because of that.
They don't have a passion,
right.

817
00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:10.860
They don't have a thing there.
Dinner trying to write a book.

818
00:46:10.861 --> 00:46:15.110
They're not trying to make a painting or whatever the fuck it is.
You know,

819
00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:17.910
they're just trying to make the money and they're making the money.

820
00:46:17.911 --> 00:46:22.260
So everything is great.
Yeah.
They,
the coke and I mean,
if,
if I pulled up,

821
00:46:22.261 --> 00:46:23.160
hey her in a,
you know,

822
00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:26.700
pop a Lamborghini with a diamond studded watch and be like,
look at this one,

823
00:46:26.701 --> 00:46:29.190
what the fuck are you must be wrong people.
Yeah.
Yeah.

824
00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:31.620
But not that many people would be,
would be that impressed.

825
00:46:31.650 --> 00:46:35.540
I think most people would think what a what a tool.
Yeah.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

826
00:46:35.850 --> 00:46:40.290
It's certain circles,
right?
It's whatever circle that you're in.
Certain circles.

827
00:46:40.290 --> 00:46:41.460
I can finance circles.

828
00:46:41.461 --> 00:46:46.461
It is about those things more than it's not because those things represent

829
00:46:46.741 --> 00:46:47.820
success in your industry.

830
00:46:48.030 --> 00:46:52.440
Your friends should read a piece of [inaudible] in a book by Michael Lewis,
um,

831
00:46:52.650 --> 00:46:54.690
and he talks to a bunch of graduates who you know,

832
00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:58.260
are about to get approached by the big banks and financial institutions.
He says,

833
00:46:58.261 --> 00:46:58.561
listen,

834
00:46:58.561 --> 00:47:02.550
you think you're going to do this for two or three years and a few million

835
00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:04.500
dollars and then do something worthwhile with your life.

836
00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:07.080
But what's going to happen is you're going to get seduced and you're going to

837
00:47:07.081 --> 00:47:08.060
get the mortgage and you're going to,

838
00:47:08.730 --> 00:47:11.220
suddenly 20 years of your life will have gone by and you'll think,

839
00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:12.570
what the fuck have I just done with?

840
00:47:12.571 --> 00:47:16.770
This is the exact advice I gave him yesterday.
The exact advice.

841
00:47:17.250 --> 00:47:20.310
I was like,
man,
you got to do something that actually makes you happy.

842
00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:22.800
Don't get sucked into that.
And he was saying,

843
00:47:22.801 --> 00:47:27.630
I was thinking of trying it for a few years.
That's what they say.

844
00:47:28.050 --> 00:47:30.370
Yeah,
man.
Once you,
once you get a mortgage,

845
00:47:31.210 --> 00:47:35.650
<v 3>once you get a car,
yeah.
Ooh,
nice BMW.
How much that run your month.</v>

846
00:47:36.250 --> 00:47:40.510
Yeah.
Ah,
fuck man.
Yeah.

847
00:47:40.990 --> 00:47:44.650
It's,
um,
it's a strange thing to the stock market,

848
00:47:44.740 --> 00:47:49.240
the moving around of numbers and looking for fluctuations in the market.

849
00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:54.610
And the fact that what drives me crazy is when you hear that people have gotten

850
00:47:54.611 --> 00:47:59.611
servers that are the closest as possible to the market because that the ping,

851
00:48:01.541 --> 00:48:01.991
because they're,

852
00:48:01.991 --> 00:48:05.260
they're using algorithms so that everything is done off of a computer program

853
00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:06.371
and the closer they are,

854
00:48:06.371 --> 00:48:10.480
the quicker that transaction takes place and it actually can be to the tune of

855
00:48:10.481 --> 00:48:12.910
millions of dollars.
That's another Michael LewisLewis' book.
Yeah.

856
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.210
Oh is it flash boys?
Yeah.
Oh,
okay.
Yeah.
These guys figured out what was going on.

857
00:48:16.211 --> 00:48:18.010
And then they started a,
um,

858
00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:21.400
a trading floor where there was so much cable that no one could benefit from

859
00:48:21.401 --> 00:48:23.660
those,
you know,
those nanoseconds and the passage,

860
00:48:24.430 --> 00:48:27.340
the other banks tried to close it down and it wasn't that popular.

861
00:48:27.730 --> 00:48:31.660
Jamie was telling me that there's a game called Fort and all the kids play and

862
00:48:31.661 --> 00:48:34.810
they're moving to Columbus,
Ohio so that they can be closer to the server.

863
00:48:34.811 --> 00:48:37.280
But that's one of the places in Texas,
also in others.

864
00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:40.120
So another place where they move to same deal.
Yeah.

865
00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:44.770
To be closer to the server so that they could ping lower cause it's like a real

866
00:48:44.771 --> 00:48:48.310
business.
Yeah.
But at least these guys are playing a game.
It's a skill.

867
00:48:48.730 --> 00:48:51.220
I mean there,
I don't know,
I guess it's a skill

868
00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:56.530
that someone made $100,000 yesterday,
but yeah.
Yeah.
So I,

869
00:48:56.531 --> 00:49:00.730
I tend on ESPN last night trying to watch the boxing those books at Madison

870
00:49:00.730 --> 00:49:01.810
Square Garden last night.
And Espn,

871
00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:06.220
the main channel had gamers in a stadium playing,

872
00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:08.170
playing football on the computer.

873
00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:11.400
They have an east sports arena in Vegas right at the luck sore.

874
00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:12.910
It's like an e sports arena.

875
00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:17.940
They got the franchise fees for the next season of call of duty or $25 million a

876
00:49:18.041 --> 00:49:21.010
team,
which is like four guys on a team.

877
00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:24.370
She's playing the game and someone's gotta pay for that.
Jesus Christ.

878
00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:28.920
You were in Dallas for the IRL Spence.
Mikey Garcia fine.
Yeah.
Yeah.

879
00:49:29.420 --> 00:49:32.680
Earl Spence is the real deal.
I mean,
I thought Mikey Garcia went out,

880
00:49:32.681 --> 00:49:35.830
books him for a few rounds at least,
um,
early on.
And then maybe,
you know,

881
00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:38.110
Spencer's size and power would make a difference.
But yeah,

882
00:49:38.111 --> 00:49:41.230
Buxton from when I looked at them in the weigh ins,
I was like,
yikes.
Yeah,

883
00:49:41.380 --> 00:49:45.270
he's a lot bigger.
Yeah.
To weight divisions.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well Mike,

884
00:49:45.271 --> 00:49:50.110
he started his career at one,
what was it,
one 35 he was featherweight champ,

885
00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:54.220
I think it was his first.
Oh,
so lighter than that.
So it was at one 26 see pool.

886
00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:54.671
Pull that up.

887
00:49:54.671 --> 00:49:59.671
Mike Garcia c they fought at 47 and Earl Spence looks every bit of one 47 I

888
00:50:01.961 --> 00:50:06.760
mean,
he's a big fella.
He looks like he could fight one 54 easy.
You know,

889
00:50:06.940 --> 00:50:09.190
Mike Garcia just looks so much smaller than him at the wedding,

890
00:50:09.191 --> 00:50:12.990
but it wasn't just the size.
It's like,
yeah,
Errol sprints,
juniors,

891
00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.310
just the real deal.
That was the surprise for me.
Yeah,
he was incredible.

892
00:50:15.390 --> 00:50:19.500
He's fucking good.
He's so smart too.
Like when you hear him talk,
he's so smooth.

893
00:50:20.350 --> 00:50:23.650
Do you remember the smiley,
he's smiling.
Trinidad fun.
Yes I do.

894
00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:25.180
It reminded me that,
yeah,

895
00:50:25.190 --> 00:50:28.070
look at the size difference and he would have put on a load of weight

896
00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:33.290
<v 2>in the next day.
Six hours as well.
Yeah.
I mean,
he's a,
he's taller,</v>

897
00:50:33.291 --> 00:50:34.280
he's wider,

898
00:50:34.281 --> 00:50:38.130
he's more muscular and he's probably pretty dehydrated making the way it looks

899
00:50:38.131 --> 00:50:40.400
there.
Roberto Duran having a time.
It was alive.
Yeah,
yeah,

900
00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:43.401
yeah.

901
00:50:43.401 --> 00:50:47.200
He was dancing at the weigh ins and shit with certain fighters were dancing and

902
00:50:47.201 --> 00:50:50.600
he was dancing to,
it was pretty funny.
What is he doing now?
Is He,

903
00:50:50.601 --> 00:50:53.660
you like working as a,
Oh,
he's helping them promote these things.

904
00:50:53.661 --> 00:50:56.300
Is that what's going on?
He was on this one.
Yeah,
he was there.
We saw a ringside.

905
00:50:56.660 --> 00:51:00.500
He's so beloved.
He's,
what a crazy story that guy had.
Right.

906
00:51:00.530 --> 00:51:05.240
Like to go for that dot.
No Mas fight.
He was,
he was shunned.

907
00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:06.660
I mean hated.
Yeah.

908
00:51:07.130 --> 00:51:11.750
Mass shame across the whole world for years until he beat Davey Moore.

909
00:51:11.860 --> 00:51:15.050
That's one of my favorite fights of all time.
It's brutal.
Brutal.

910
00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:19.910
Just to see that tenacity just slowly come and I read a story that Tyson was at

911
00:51:19.911 --> 00:51:23.030
that fight with all of his friends from Brooklyn and they couldn't afford

912
00:51:23.031 --> 00:51:26.000
tickets so they just rushed the security gate knowing that three or four of them

913
00:51:26.001 --> 00:51:28.910
would get cool real and the others were getting and that's how he'd go in.
Yeah.

914
00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.220
Wow.
Wow.
Yeah.

915
00:51:31.221 --> 00:51:34.430
I remember watching that fight thinking that he was going to lose and I was a

916
00:51:34.431 --> 00:51:37.790
big Roberto Duran fan and I'll say,
God man,
he's probably going to lose.

917
00:51:37.900 --> 00:51:41.450
He was supposedly is right.
He the sure and he fucked Davey Moore up.

918
00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:45.710
Davey more wound up dying a crazy accident where he was working on his car in

919
00:51:45.711 --> 00:51:49.470
his driveway and it fell on him.
Yeah,
he,

920
00:51:49.770 --> 00:51:52.970
it fell on him or at random over like one of those things and he was trying to

921
00:51:52.971 --> 00:51:55.820
fix his car.
Something fucked up like that.

922
00:51:56.870 --> 00:52:00.620
And Duran laced in at one point when he started the leather laces.
Yup.

923
00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:01.790
He thumbed him too.

924
00:52:01.791 --> 00:52:05.000
They think that's what you remember his eyes swollen up pretty bad.

925
00:52:05.210 --> 00:52:07.910
That's one of the fights that makes me feel a bit guilty about loving boxing.

926
00:52:08.090 --> 00:52:11.450
When you,
when you see that,
cause it's so true to fucking businessman.

927
00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:13.730
It's a brutal business,
you know?
I mean,

928
00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:17.870
I don't know if MMA is more brutal.
I think it probably is,

929
00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:20.990
but there's a lot of pokes.

930
00:52:20.991 --> 00:52:25.330
The eye in MMA a lot and most of them are on,

931
00:52:25.730 --> 00:52:29.650
they're unintentional,
most of them,
but a bunch have to be intentional.

932
00:52:29.651 --> 00:52:33.080
I think that gets me the MMA is because I come from books and he's is my sport.

933
00:52:33.081 --> 00:52:36.560
When you see a guy go down and he's clearly out and the guy jumps on him and

934
00:52:36.561 --> 00:52:38.720
pounds him,
I know sometimes the ref tries to get into that.

935
00:52:38.770 --> 00:52:42.430
That's just a bit too much for me.
It's this weekend or a doll.

936
00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:45.280
He knocked out Darren tell and he koom he,

937
00:52:45.290 --> 00:52:47.480
he clipped him with a left hand on the way down.

938
00:52:47.481 --> 00:52:51.200
He hit him with another left hand and then Darren till is flatline completely

939
00:52:51.201 --> 00:52:55.370
out and mosfet out on corks.
A bomb right on his face while he's out cold.

940
00:52:55.780 --> 00:52:57.710
It was rough.
I mean,
correct me if I'm wrong,

941
00:52:57.711 --> 00:53:01.790
but I feel like a books in crowd appreciates a good skillful technical match.

942
00:53:01.860 --> 00:53:05.330
And I feel like sometimes a UFC crowd will be cheering at that moment you just

943
00:53:05.331 --> 00:53:08.720
described.
I think humans like brawls,

944
00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:12.710
I mean there's a reason why all Touro Gadi and Micky Ward was such a successful

945
00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:17.860
trilogy is because those guys would just beat the fuck out of it.
Yeah,

946
00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:21.950
there were so closely matched and they were both these blood and guts warriors

947
00:53:21.951 --> 00:53:23.720
and they just stood in front of each other and they were,

948
00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:26.340
and we knew at the that these

949
00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:29.400
<v 3>guys are not going to beat Floyd Mayweather to not going to beat the best guys</v>

950
00:53:29.500 --> 00:53:33.720
there.
You know,
they're good fighters,
worldclass fighters,

951
00:53:33.721 --> 00:53:35.160
but they're not world champions.

952
00:53:35.610 --> 00:53:39.330
And there's a thing that we look at when we watch fighters.

953
00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:43.650
Like fighter could be good,
but there's a,
there's a fighters that we appreciate,

954
00:53:43.710 --> 00:53:46.500
but they'll never fight for the world title.
If they do,
they have no chance.

955
00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:49.380
And then there's fighters.
Like this guy might be the best in the world.

956
00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:52.650
You know there's a difference,
you know,
and you could buy a Floyd.

957
00:53:52.860 --> 00:53:54.940
It's defensive skills,
but he's never going to have that.

958
00:53:54.941 --> 00:53:57.870
That wall with Micky ward or archer or gas.
He like never,

959
00:53:58.020 --> 00:54:00.390
but he's also going to be fine.

960
00:54:00.391 --> 00:54:04.560
When he's 55 he'll be able to talk and walk and you know,

961
00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:07.830
nothing happens to them.
To him,
his,
he's not.
He doesn't,

962
00:54:07.831 --> 00:54:11.010
he didn't endure the punishment in the beatings that those guys had.

963
00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:16.350
That's the saddest of all is when you see these guys,
you see them on television,

964
00:54:16.770 --> 00:54:20.220
you see the war,
you see the F,
but you don't see the aftermath.

965
00:54:20.580 --> 00:54:23.870
You don't see the struggles that they have with their memory.
You don't see the,

966
00:54:23.871 --> 00:54:28.650
the confusion,
the anger out of nowhere.
The emotional outbursts where they don't,

967
00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:30.180
they don't know why they're doing what they're doing.

968
00:54:30.181 --> 00:54:31.560
They don't why they're saying what they're saying.

969
00:54:31.590 --> 00:54:34.200
Most of them are broke before they even retired.
Yup.
Yeah,
yeah.

970
00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:36.060
Did you see the film about Michael Ben?

971
00:54:36.350 --> 00:54:39.540
It just came out on Netflix as part of that loses series?
No,
I did not.
That's,

972
00:54:39.580 --> 00:54:41.130
that's worth watching.
He,
um,

973
00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:43.920
he never really liked boxing and everybody wanted to box but has got a really

974
00:54:43.921 --> 00:54:48.750
successful career in Hollywood producing plays and movies.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's like,

975
00:54:48.751 --> 00:54:52.980
it's a great,
Michael Bent produces plays and movies play I think.

976
00:54:52.980 --> 00:54:57.210
And he teaches a act as how to how to box as well when they're doing movies.

977
00:54:57.240 --> 00:54:58.680
It's a great little talk.
Good for him.
Well,

978
00:54:58.681 --> 00:55:02.460
I'm always very happy when someone finds a path,
you know,

979
00:55:02.490 --> 00:55:06.450
you just get the sense that boxing was never him and he found a way at the end

980
00:55:06.451 --> 00:55:09.270
to be him and do something he loved and he's thriving at it,
which,

981
00:55:09.300 --> 00:55:13.530
which is a rare thing for Xbox.
It's crazy when people are just good at things.

982
00:55:13.531 --> 00:55:14.880
There's a guy in MMA like that,

983
00:55:14.881 --> 00:55:18.540
Anthony Rumble Johnson who was one of the most terrifying fighters in the

984
00:55:18.541 --> 00:55:22.890
history of the sport just to ruthless knockout artists.
And um,

985
00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:26.370
last his last loss,
he w I was talking to him in the octagon.

986
00:55:26.371 --> 00:55:29.010
I was interviewing him and he said,
I know I don't like fighting.

987
00:55:29.011 --> 00:55:33.510
I'm not a fighter.
He goes,
I'm an athlete,
I'm just good at it.
And I was like,
wow,

988
00:55:33.511 --> 00:55:35.610
that is a crazy honest,

989
00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:39.480
like and such an introspective way of like,

990
00:55:39.481 --> 00:55:41.580
he's like looking at themselves like,
look it,
this is not what,

991
00:55:41.710 --> 00:55:44.940
I don't want to do this.
Yeah.
But since then he's thought about coming back.

992
00:55:45.030 --> 00:55:46.860
But people say to me all the time,

993
00:55:46.861 --> 00:55:48.930
your adrenaline junkie or addicted to the thrill.
I'm like,

994
00:55:49.110 --> 00:55:51.210
there's no fucking thrilled doing this.
What you think?

995
00:55:51.211 --> 00:55:55.380
It's a thrilling I note and no question.
I'm sure there's no thrill for you.

996
00:55:55.440 --> 00:56:00.440
But do you think that being in these incredibly tense environments ramps life up

997
00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:08.250
in a way that you don't get outside of it?
Like,
did you,
did you read tribe?

998
00:56:08.251 --> 00:56:11.700
Sebastian younger and I met him a few times as well.
He was,
he was,

999
00:56:11.701 --> 00:56:14.220
when I was having a few problems,
he was,
he was very helpful.
He was,

1000
00:56:14.310 --> 00:56:17.970
wasn't he really good guy?
I really liked that guy.
Yeah.
Uh,
yeah.
Before I met him.

1001
00:56:17.971 --> 00:56:19.500
I mean,
he's got that picture in vanity fair,

1002
00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:23.660
like posing with the dog tag and it's like a muddle looking picture

1003
00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:28.480
<v 0>guide were tosser.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
And then I met him and he was the nicest,</v>

1004
00:56:28.510 --> 00:56:30.880
most humble,
considerate guy.
He's,
he's fantastic.

1005
00:56:30.881 --> 00:56:32.830
And I really like that book as well.
Yeah.
I couldn't,

1006
00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:35.910
I couldn't be a bigger fan of hers as a human to just,

1007
00:56:36.100 --> 00:56:38.830
just very genuine really there when you're talking to him.

1008
00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:43.330
But that's sort of his take on it is that,
um,
and if you're listening,

1009
00:56:43.331 --> 00:56:46.540
I know I talk about that book too much.
Uh,
I just love it,

1010
00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:51.730
but his take on it was that these people are experiencing life in this

1011
00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:55.510
incredibly extreme environment and then they come back to the rest of the world.

1012
00:56:55.511 --> 00:56:57.700
It just doesn't feel real anymore.
So it's not,

1013
00:56:57.730 --> 00:57:00.490
it's not thrilling when you're there,
but it is real drama.

1014
00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:02.650
You're seeing life and death drama right in front of your face.

1015
00:57:02.651 --> 00:57:03.490
So when you come back,

1016
00:57:03.491 --> 00:57:06.880
you think you really want to see this person and see this film and try out this

1017
00:57:06.881 --> 00:57:09.850
new restaurant and then you get back and you just each,
you don't care.

1018
00:57:10.030 --> 00:57:12.830
He's just feels flat.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean,
you know,
when,

1019
00:57:12.831 --> 00:57:16.510
when I was getting the PTSD treatment,
numb,
numbness was the word that came out.

1020
00:57:16.511 --> 00:57:19.000
More numbness to everything,
like numbness to the danger when you're there,

1021
00:57:19.001 --> 00:57:22.600
but numbness back here for the things that should be pleasurable and should be

1022
00:57:22.601 --> 00:57:24.430
providing some kind of relief as well.
Now,

1023
00:57:24.431 --> 00:57:28.540
how did the pts PTSD treatment and get organized as this through maps?

1024
00:57:28.630 --> 00:57:31.510
Are you part of that study?
Yeah,
we did,
uh,
did a short film about,

1025
00:57:31.511 --> 00:57:34.090
about Rick Doblin and this,
this,
you know,
there's this effort to,

1026
00:57:34.091 --> 00:57:38.230
to get MTMA legal.
Um,
but I'd been in denial for years and years.

1027
00:57:38.231 --> 00:57:42.100
Then a new producer joined vice guy called Steven Bailey and we had the first

1028
00:57:42.101 --> 00:57:43.360
idea where he was pitching some,

1029
00:57:43.510 --> 00:57:46.900
some the first meeting when he was pitching some of his ideas.
And he mentioned,

1030
00:57:46.901 --> 00:57:49.750
you know,
this breakthrough therapy using MTMA for PTSD.

1031
00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:53.400
And I just in voluntarily put my hand up and said I'll do it straight away and

1032
00:57:53.410 --> 00:57:55.900
was like,
gave me an excuse to actually,
you know,

1033
00:57:56.620 --> 00:58:00.910
get some help and see if I had something done MTMA recreationally before that.

1034
00:58:00.940 --> 00:58:05.080
I mean,
yeah,
I came of age in London in the 90s,
you know,
he had like,

1035
00:58:05.081 --> 00:58:06.160
it was like having a pint of beer.

1036
00:58:06.610 --> 00:58:10.600
Then what is the difference between doing it in a therapeutic environment?

1037
00:58:10.630 --> 00:58:15.280
I mean it's,
I,
it's,
it's Mtma assisted therapy.
The emphasis is on the therapy.

1038
00:58:15.700 --> 00:58:20.530
So you're lying in a bed if you've fasted for 24 hours before the therapist

1039
00:58:20.531 --> 00:58:24.640
knows you and knows your issues.
So knows how to like politely,

1040
00:58:24.850 --> 00:58:28.240
gently nudge you towards the right topic of conversation,
but always makes it,

1041
00:58:28.570 --> 00:58:32.290
makes you actually get to the conclusions.
Um,
you know,

1042
00:58:32.291 --> 00:58:35.710
there were times when I will ask him,
why is this happening?
Why do I think this?

1043
00:58:35.711 --> 00:58:39.300
And He'd put it back on me and make me put two and two together.
Um,

1044
00:58:39.850 --> 00:58:41.200
sometimes you listen to music,

1045
00:58:41.201 --> 00:58:43.880
sometimes you put an eye mask on and you don't sleep,
but you just,
you know,

1046
00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:45.880
have a quiet 20,
30 minutes.
But it's a,

1047
00:58:46.180 --> 00:58:49.900
it's a very intense seven to eight hour therapy session and the MD may just

1048
00:58:49.901 --> 00:58:51.280
enables you to get the benefits.

1049
00:58:51.281 --> 00:58:54.850
And all of the veterans and first responders who took part in the first round of

1050
00:58:54.851 --> 00:58:58.540
trials had been therapy resistant.
Um,
and I think the first round,

1051
00:58:58.541 --> 00:59:03.010
I think 72% of them got the benefits and we're considered PTSD free after,

1052
00:59:03.310 --> 00:59:06.670
after the three month trial.
So during the three month trial,

1053
00:59:06.671 --> 00:59:10.630
how many experiences do they have?
One a month.
One a month or three?
Three total.

1054
00:59:10.631 --> 00:59:15.510
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean the best,
the best example I can give of how this works,

1055
00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:17.320
I had,
the first veteran I met had been through it.

1056
00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:21.260
He had one session and he'd lost some friends in Iraq and it felt guilty about

1057
00:59:21.261 --> 00:59:23.270
it and always thought maybe if I'd done something different that could have

1058
00:59:23.271 --> 00:59:24.104
saved them.

1059
00:59:24.470 --> 00:59:29.470
And he imagined being them in in the first MDA session and they were saying to

1060
00:59:29.751 --> 00:59:33.230
him,
why are you ruining your life?
You're alive,
you're healthy.

1061
00:59:33.231 --> 00:59:37.490
We want you to have a fun,
productive,
full life and enjoy your friends,

1062
00:59:37.500 --> 00:59:38.480
enjoy your family.

1063
00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:41.960
And he said that gave him permission and that was what he needed.

1064
00:59:41.961 --> 00:59:44.930
And he didn't even do the second two sessions.
Wow.

1065
00:59:46.280 --> 00:59:48.440
What an interesting way of looking at it of course.

1066
00:59:48.590 --> 00:59:51.140
And that word permission because there is so much guilt and you're just getting

1067
00:59:51.141 --> 00:59:53.850
permission to just give yourself a bit of a pattern.

1068
00:59:53.851 --> 00:59:57.770
The survivor self or breaking is a real oh yeah.
Yeah.

1069
00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:02.150
A lot of people that come back from the war that lost friends have that horrible

1070
01:00:02.151 --> 01:00:04.100
feeling that it should've been them.

1071
01:00:04.230 --> 01:00:08.740
That they're not as good as the person who died or that somehow or another them

1072
01:00:08.750 --> 01:00:11.060
being alive is the reason why their friend was dead.

1073
01:00:11.090 --> 01:00:15.230
Irrational thoughts or maybe I didn't really experience it because I came out

1074
01:00:15.231 --> 01:00:17.270
unscathed.
Um,
yeah,

1075
01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:20.570
which is one of the reasons why I didn't seek treatment for years and years and

1076
01:00:20.571 --> 01:00:22.070
years.
Cause I've got friends who lost their legs.

1077
01:00:22.071 --> 01:00:23.870
I've got friends who were kidnapped and killed,
you know,

1078
01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:27.110
so maybe I've only just dipped my toes so there's nothing,
nothing.

1079
01:00:27.111 --> 01:00:31.190
I've got nothing to complain about.
What was your number one issue?

1080
01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:36.410
Um,
I think the numbness to danger and to pleasurable things back here.

1081
01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:39.380
Um,
I mean like my,
my camera man in Mosul,

1082
01:00:39.381 --> 01:00:41.870
we were there when the Iraqi army beat Isis and it was,

1083
01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:43.480
I mean it was house to house fighting.

1084
01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:48.210
We were stepping on bodies to get through rooms.
And at one point,
um,

1085
01:00:48.350 --> 01:00:48.830
I was with,

1086
01:00:48.830 --> 01:00:51.890
we were with three or four Iraqi soldiers trying to get to the river to cut off

1087
01:00:51.900 --> 01:00:53.210
these two isis positions.

1088
01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:56.660
And they've got a radio message saying there's a suicide bomber and a gunman

1089
01:00:56.690 --> 01:00:59.840
running down the street towards you now.
So we stepped into this,

1090
01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:02.660
what used to be a shop that was all blown up and smashed a bit.

1091
01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:06.800
And I sat down as the two soldiers tried to shoot the suicide bomber as he was

1092
01:01:06.801 --> 01:01:09.680
running towards us and someone said Id id.

1093
01:01:09.681 --> 01:01:13.010
And right next to me under the rubble was an IED.
The day before,
I think,

1094
01:01:13.011 --> 01:01:16.250
or two days before to French journalists and Curtis journalist had been killed

1095
01:01:16.251 --> 01:01:20.240
when they stepped on an IED trying to get out and have ea Manzano.

1096
01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:24.230
My camera man just said,
you look bored.
Um,

1097
01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:28.370
and he filmed it like we got that moment on camera and I remember just looking

1098
01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:32.990
so bored and I couldn't give a shit about the suicide bomber,
the IED.

1099
01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:36.620
I was just bored out of my brains.
And that's when I thought this is,

1100
01:01:37.250 --> 01:01:39.980
this is not a natural reaction to what's going on around you right now.

1101
01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:45.360
What did you think your natural reaction should have been?
I mean,
blood racing,

1102
01:01:45.380 --> 01:01:49.100
racing,
heart rate,
increasing,
you know,
um,
vigilance,
um,
you know,

1103
01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:52.520
and what did you think at the time was the cause of you being known?

1104
01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:57.110
Like while it was happening,
I hadn't really thought that much about PTSD.

1105
01:01:57.111 --> 01:01:58.810
I just thought it'd become so used to this.
And,

1106
01:01:58.811 --> 01:02:00.230
and one of the things that came up in the,

1107
01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:05.440
in the one of the last sessions I did was I didn't think I was seen as important

1108
01:02:05.451 --> 01:02:09.410
enough to get to get shot and hurt and have medics rush over to help me and

1109
01:02:09.411 --> 01:02:11.870
maybe a helicopter to take me out.
And,
you know,
um,

1110
01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:15.590
and I know that sounds ridiculous now,
but I think part of me thought,
yeah,

1111
01:02:15.591 --> 01:02:18.170
you're not important enough to have something so dramatic happened to you.

1112
01:02:18.171 --> 01:02:21.840
You're just,
you're just witnessing other people in these dramas.

1113
01:02:22.950 --> 01:02:23.783
Wow.

1114
01:02:26.250 --> 01:02:30.900
It'd be right next to an IUD and not freaking out is pretty crazy.
Yeah.

1115
01:02:30.930 --> 01:02:34.170
With a suicide bomber riding down the street towards,
I mean,
that's,
and also,

1116
01:02:34.171 --> 01:02:35.280
you know,
people,
people,

1117
01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:38.430
one of the reasons you feel guilty as you do get respect for being brave.

1118
01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:43.500
And I would say it wasn't bravery.
I wasn't scared and then did it anyway.

1119
01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:47.570
I wasn't scared.
I was just numb and just,
you know,
kept the,

1120
01:02:47.571 --> 01:02:50.010
get respect from other journalists,
from the soldiers.

1121
01:02:50.011 --> 01:02:53.070
Like who are you getting respect from?
Yeah.
Or,
or people that,
whatever the films.

1122
01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:57.660
And,
uh,
it doesn't,
it doesn't feel like bravery.
It just feels like you're,

1123
01:02:58.140 --> 01:03:01.800
you know,
you've,
you've,
you've become stupid about the risks you're taking.

1124
01:03:01.890 --> 01:03:06.000
So talk me through this therapy.
So you're fasting for 24 hours,

1125
01:03:06.030 --> 01:03:10.980
you take the Mtma and then they just start talking to you about the things that

1126
01:03:10.981 --> 01:03:12.420
are troubling.
Yeah.

1127
01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:16.050
So you take 125 milligrams and then when that hits a lot,

1128
01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:19.890
I think it's a good dose,
but then when it hits you take another 75.

1129
01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:24.150
So overall that's,
that's a good dose.
And that keeps you up for,
you know,
six,

1130
01:03:24.151 --> 01:03:27.620
seven,
eight hours.
Um,
and then,
you know,

1131
01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:32.100
the therapist would ask very brief question,
just,
just knowing what,

1132
01:03:32.380 --> 01:03:35.190
what direction to push me.
And I remember the first session,
I mean,

1133
01:03:35.191 --> 01:03:38.100
I'd thought because of what I now know was PTSD,

1134
01:03:38.101 --> 01:03:39.840
I'd felt because of the job I do.

1135
01:03:39.841 --> 01:03:42.870
And because there was this kind of darkness in there,

1136
01:03:43.470 --> 01:03:46.350
I didn't get involved with anyone seriously for a very long time.

1137
01:03:46.351 --> 01:03:49.890
And even thought I'm not going to have a family and kids and house and dog.

1138
01:03:49.891 --> 01:03:52.140
And you know,
I just just had even thought about it,

1139
01:03:52.141 --> 01:03:55.440
just assumed that's not for me because of the job I do.

1140
01:03:56.430 --> 01:04:00.360
And very early on in that first session after I resisted it for about an hour

1141
01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:00.361
and a half,

1142
01:04:00.361 --> 01:04:03.270
like was really resisting it for a long time and thinking it was even a plus

1143
01:04:03.330 --> 01:04:08.190
placebo.
Um,
but,
but there was this wave of relief.
I've just,

1144
01:04:08.191 --> 01:04:10.950
of course you can of course you can have all that.
And it,

1145
01:04:11.370 --> 01:04:13.200
it felt like a revelation.
Wow.

1146
01:04:13.470 --> 01:04:18.210
Cause I thought that had been close to me for so long.
I know seven,
eight years,

1147
01:04:18.211 --> 01:04:20.520
maybe longer.
I just thought,
no,
you can't do that.

1148
01:04:20.521 --> 01:04:22.980
That's not for you or you can't put someone else through that with you.

1149
01:04:23.130 --> 01:04:26.420
What is it particularly about Mtma what is it about,
I mean I've,

1150
01:04:26.421 --> 01:04:28.530
I've done it but I've only done it once.
The,

1151
01:04:28.650 --> 01:04:33.650
is it just because of the fact that it just alleviates the insecurity and allows

1152
01:04:33.751 --> 01:04:35.700
you to look at things in a more natural sense?

1153
01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:39.150
You look at everything as if we're just talking about having coffee or water,

1154
01:04:39.151 --> 01:04:43.200
everything is just easy to think about on a dress and talk about.
Um,

1155
01:04:43.250 --> 01:04:44.760
and I think I'll probably explain it badly,

1156
01:04:44.761 --> 01:04:48.000
but I think the science of it is you have five networks in your brain.
And,

1157
01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:51.870
and I was basically in fight or flight mode so much that that was the only mode

1158
01:04:51.900 --> 01:04:56.190
I knew.
So even when I'm back in New York,
if someone walks up to close behind me,

1159
01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:59.520
I'm expecting a confrontation.
I mean fight or flight mode all the time.

1160
01:04:59.521 --> 01:05:03.720
So your brain is ignoring the other parts of your brain that provide context.

1161
01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:06.750
And that say that bang outside is just a car backfiring.

1162
01:05:06.751 --> 01:05:11.580
It's not an id or someone shooting.
So the MDA just allows your brain to,

1163
01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:13.710
you know,
all the parts of your brain to communicate.
Again,

1164
01:05:13.711 --> 01:05:15.990
you're not just in that fight or flight mode.

1165
01:05:15.990 --> 01:05:17.890
So once you get out of that fight or flight mode,

1166
01:05:18.370 --> 01:05:22.030
you can then address things that,
that you can even begin to address before.

1167
01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:26.290
And once you've had these experiences for you,
it was three experiences.

1168
01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:30.430
They're profound enough that you retain the benefits.
Some,

1169
01:05:30.431 --> 01:05:34.810
I mean it looks like I'm in the 25% that still have PTSD after the three months,

1170
01:05:34.811 --> 01:05:36.760
but it still helps enormously.
I mean,

1171
01:05:36.761 --> 01:05:41.110
the next day they got me to sit down and do a video diary and I was kind of

1172
01:05:41.111 --> 01:05:43.990
saying,
yeah,
I thought this near this was a revelation.
And I said,
you know what,

1173
01:05:43.991 --> 01:05:44.620
I'm just,

1174
01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:49.240
I'm just smiling now in a way that I don't feel like I've smiled for years.

1175
01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:52.390
Like it feels like my whole face is smiling and there's the next day,

1176
01:05:52.391 --> 01:05:54.520
which is usually a little wrecked.
Yeah.

1177
01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.800
I think it's two or three days when you have the,

1178
01:05:56.890 --> 01:06:00.310
what we used to call a moody Tuesday.
Oh yeah.
That one at two or three days.
Yeah.

1179
01:06:00.311 --> 01:06:04.390
But then with this there,
there's no,
there's no come down with this.
It's,
it's,

1180
01:06:04.391 --> 01:06:06.470
you know,
there,
there,
there's no downside how they give,
you know,

1181
01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:10.860
they give you five HTP or anything while you're,
um,
nothing apart from the Mtma.

1182
01:06:10.870 --> 01:06:14.240
I mean,
wow,
you have,
you have juice,
you have water throughout.
Um,

1183
01:06:14.290 --> 01:06:16.290
I mean maybe the come down is related to,
you know,

1184
01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:20.330
people that used to take it with just dance and sweat right on lightly hydrate.

1185
01:06:20.380 --> 01:06:24.400
Yeah.
Yeah.
Maybe.
Maybe it's just shitty Mtma maybe.

1186
01:06:25.140 --> 01:06:26.230
Yeah.
I mean the,
yeah,

1187
01:06:26.231 --> 01:06:29.470
the ecstasy they would have sold in London would have been eating rat poison and

1188
01:06:29.471 --> 01:06:33.370
breeze block that and all kinds of stuff.
Yeah.
Um,

1189
01:06:33.580 --> 01:06:37.090
so I know they're having very positive results with this.

1190
01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:42.120
And are they planning on implementing this to the public in any tire short term?

1191
01:06:42.820 --> 01:06:45.520
I mean,
is this something that like people that are listening to this right now,

1192
01:06:45.521 --> 01:06:47.710
is this going to be available to them fairly soon?

1193
01:06:47.770 --> 01:06:50.650
It looks like it should be legal by 2021,
2022,

1194
01:06:50.651 --> 01:06:54.860
the third round of officially FDA approved trial start soon.
Um,

1195
01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:57.790
that's the first one that involves people other than veterans and first

1196
01:06:57.791 --> 01:07:01.720
responders.
If that gets as good results of the first two trials,

1197
01:07:01.721 --> 01:07:04.150
which I'm sure it will then,
then I think it's going to be,

1198
01:07:04.270 --> 01:07:07.890
and because FDA gave it breakthrough drug status,
there's nothing that you know,

1199
01:07:08.170 --> 01:07:09.250
anyone can do to stop it.

1200
01:07:09.251 --> 01:07:13.480
It will be legal by 2021 2022 that's very good news for a lot of people that are

1201
01:07:13.481 --> 01:07:18.100
suffering.
Yeah.
It's so difficult for people to change perspective just to,

1202
01:07:18.250 --> 01:07:23.250
to have a break from the normal sort of momentum of your life and to be able to

1203
01:07:23.891 --> 01:07:28.360
stop and analyze.
Yeah.
And that's exactly what it did to me.

1204
01:07:28.361 --> 01:07:32.120
I was just in this Rut for so long where there was,
it was impossible to,
to,

1205
01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:36.640
to look at things.
Did you think about changing your life?
Yeah,

1206
01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:39.340
and I'm thinking about a lot right now.
I mean,
I,
you know,
I,

1207
01:07:39.341 --> 01:07:43.390
I thought I would retire after this,
um,
this therapy,

1208
01:07:44.020 --> 01:07:45.760
but I think I said it before the,
you know,

1209
01:07:45.790 --> 01:07:48.220
in the first session I was planning the next film,
next area.
He's like,

1210
01:07:48.221 --> 01:07:50.320
this is still what I want to do.
I've just got to do it smarter.

1211
01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:54.480
I've got to take breaks.
I've got to recover in between trips.
Um,

1212
01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:58.300
there isn't this pressure to be where people are getting their heads blown off

1213
01:07:58.301 --> 01:07:58.991
every single time.

1214
01:07:58.991 --> 01:08:01.900
And then the last one I did was about Yemen and we spent a week on the front

1215
01:08:01.901 --> 01:08:05.740
lines with the various fighting groups and got the usual crazy fighting footage.

1216
01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:09.780
But the powerful stuff was a woman who had her leg blown off by an airstrike and

1217
01:08:09.790 --> 01:08:13.200
an IDP camp in a miserable IDP camp where the Saudis Nimrod,

1218
01:08:13.201 --> 01:08:15.620
he's a claiming they're providing people with everything they need.

1219
01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:17.300
And then at the end,

1220
01:08:17.301 --> 01:08:21.170
a child malnutrition clinic right on the front line where a nurse just just

1221
01:08:21.470 --> 01:08:24.170
begged all parties to end this war.
And she was,

1222
01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:27.770
she was literally on the front line surrounded by a minefield,

1223
01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:29.930
couldn't get doctors,
couldn't get supplies,

1224
01:08:30.410 --> 01:08:33.740
had a few dozen kids in this clinic that she was just managing to keep alive.

1225
01:08:33.780 --> 01:08:37.760
And he's whaling emaciated babies with their rib cages,
caged it caved in.

1226
01:08:38.330 --> 01:08:42.230
Um,
and you know,
the reason you do this or to cover the effects of war,

1227
01:08:42.290 --> 01:08:44.990
it's not to get crazy for Tj of explosions and shoot outs.

1228
01:08:44.991 --> 01:08:46.790
It's the effect of war on civilians.

1229
01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:51.950
So maybe the answer is to do that and you know,
not feel this pressure to,
to,

1230
01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.850
to just get the crazy fighting footage all the time in our country.

1231
01:08:55.850 --> 01:09:00.650
Yemen is in many ways,
mostly synonymous for drone attacks.

1232
01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:04.580
Drone strikes is when we think about Yemen,

1233
01:09:04.581 --> 01:09:08.270
we think about the drawn tracks that we hear about on wedding parties,

1234
01:09:08.271 --> 01:09:09.350
the accident,
the,
the,

1235
01:09:09.770 --> 01:09:13.010
the number of people that are accidentally kill the civilian casualty rate as

1236
01:09:13.011 --> 01:09:15.020
some preposterous number.
Yeah.
I mean,

1237
01:09:15.021 --> 01:09:16.970
no one knows because you can't check out most of these areas,

1238
01:09:16.971 --> 01:09:19.370
but it's in the tens of thousands at least.
And it's,

1239
01:09:19.430 --> 01:09:24.340
the percentage is all so preposterous.
It's far more than 50%.
Right?
Yeah.

1240
01:09:24.350 --> 01:09:28.370
I mean it's,
it's air strikes.
So it used to be us drone strikes on,

1241
01:09:28.460 --> 01:09:33.460
on al Qaeda assassinates now it's Saudi MRT airstrikes and um,

1242
01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:37.360
with,
with us assistance,
I mean,
we were until recently refueling the plane,

1243
01:09:37.361 --> 01:09:40.970
supplying the plane,
supplying the weapons.
But yeah,
they've hit weddings,

1244
01:09:40.971 --> 01:09:45.740
funerals,
that,
schools,
hospitals.
Um,
and I don't think that's,

1245
01:09:45.770 --> 01:09:48.990
that's by accident.
I think they're taking her approach to Yemen,
that,

1246
01:09:48.991 --> 01:09:51.170
that we need to crush the opposition,

1247
01:09:52.010 --> 01:09:54.440
not take out the military leaders and you can't,

1248
01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:59.420
there's no movement in history that been crushed by fourth that never works to

1249
01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:02.270
Christ.
When you're over there,

1250
01:10:02.271 --> 01:10:06.830
what does it feel like in Yemen as opposed to Afghanistan or other places?

1251
01:10:07.820 --> 01:10:11.990
Um,
Yemen,
the actual fighting is,
is much more low intensity.

1252
01:10:12.140 --> 01:10:15.950
It's fairly small groups of guys at some distance just lobbing shelves each

1253
01:10:15.951 --> 01:10:17.120
other and,
and there's,
you know,

1254
01:10:17.121 --> 01:10:21.350
there's snipers and that there are gunfights but it's not as big scalers as Iraq

1255
01:10:21.351 --> 01:10:25.250
or Afghanistan,
but there were a regular air strikes that are killing civilians.

1256
01:10:25.310 --> 01:10:26.143
Um,

1257
01:10:26.780 --> 01:10:30.440
and while the two sides are fighting this,

1258
01:10:30.441 --> 01:10:33.020
this slow and bloody war,
um,

1259
01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:38.000
the infrastructure is being destroyed and the civilians are unable to get basic

1260
01:10:38.001 --> 01:10:41.270
food and medicine.
That,
that's the really shocking thing there.
And also the,

1261
01:10:41.330 --> 01:10:44.000
I mean,
I knew that,
that the coalition,
as it's called,
you know,
the,
the,

1262
01:10:44.001 --> 01:10:47.600
the fighting groups backed by Saudi Arabia and UAE where American backed,

1263
01:10:48.050 --> 01:10:50.930
but you see American stuff everywhere.
I mean m wraps,
you know,

1264
01:10:50.931 --> 01:10:52.490
these million dollar bump,
we've trucks,

1265
01:10:52.491 --> 01:10:55.010
I've only ever seen American soldiers and marines driving in Iraq and

1266
01:10:55.011 --> 01:10:58.700
Afghanistan.
You see them everywhere there.
Um,

1267
01:10:58.850 --> 01:11:02.210
and that's a real surprise to see that.
Wow.

1268
01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:06.770
How did Yemen become this area that's so synonymous,
withdrawn strikes.

1269
01:11:06.771 --> 01:11:11.090
Like why did we approach Yemen differently than any other part of the world in

1270
01:11:11.091 --> 01:11:14.010
terms of the,
the,
the allocation drone strikes

1271
01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:16.590
<v 2>there in terms of numbers?
I don't know.
I mean,</v>

1272
01:11:16.591 --> 01:11:20.310
I think for a while the only thing the US was doing in Yemen was drone strikes

1273
01:11:20.311 --> 01:11:22.200
against al Qaeda.
Um,

1274
01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:25.060
but I don't know if there had been more drone strikes in Yemen and then

1275
01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:28.080
elsewhere.
I mean,
that's where we killed an American citizen that,

1276
01:11:28.081 --> 01:11:33.060
which got lots of headlines on purpose with no trial.
They just seem to,

1277
01:11:33.061 --> 01:11:37.880
so we'll do it was because he had joined isis,
is that what it was?
Yeah,
it was,

1278
01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:42.180
it was a very well known and popular,
um,
you know,
uh,
online presence,

1279
01:11:42.570 --> 01:11:47.490
rallying people to,
to fight.
But the air strikes in,
in,
in Yemen,
uh,

1280
01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:52.650
um,
you know,
and,
and you know,
with,
with us weapons are that,
that's,
that's,

1281
01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:56.430
that's what's really killing people.
And,
and,
and meaning that people can't get,

1282
01:11:56.550 --> 01:12:00.370
get food nade there because you just can't move things around there.
Um,

1283
01:12:00.690 --> 01:12:04.520
whatever came out of that guy getting killed,
they,

1284
01:12:04.770 --> 01:12:08.280
they basically,
no one was punished for it.
I mean,

1285
01:12:08.700 --> 01:12:11.910
he's an American citizen.
He was,
I mean,
if it was in America,

1286
01:12:12.060 --> 01:12:16.550
if somehow or another this guy was in the suburbs of Chicago and they launched a

1287
01:12:16.590 --> 01:12:19.500
drone strike on him,
it would be front page news and it'd be a real issue.

1288
01:12:19.501 --> 01:12:23.760
But the fact that was in Yemen,
I mean,
again,

1289
01:12:23.761 --> 01:12:28.320
the legacy of Iraq and Afghanistan is that now we're killing guys like him with

1290
01:12:28.321 --> 01:12:32.080
drone strikes or special forces raids here and there.
And it's,

1291
01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:36.510
it's happening almost in secret.
And no one's saying this appears to be illegal.

1292
01:12:36.570 --> 01:12:39.630
I mean,
some people are,
you know,
you can,
you,
you know,

1293
01:12:39.631 --> 01:12:41.490
which media outlets you can go to to read about this.

1294
01:12:41.491 --> 01:12:44.370
But I think most people are thinking if that's,

1295
01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:47.130
if that's the alternative to invasion.
Yeah.

1296
01:12:47.420 --> 01:12:50.880
And trillions of dollars and American soldiers coming back with no legs for a

1297
01:12:50.881 --> 01:12:54.240
war.
We don't understand.
I think a lot of people are willing to accept it.

1298
01:12:54.390 --> 01:12:57.390
I don't agree with it.
But that seems to be what's happening now.
No,

1299
01:12:57.391 --> 01:12:58.760
I think you're right.
Um,

1300
01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:02.430
the other thing about that is with a lot of these,

1301
01:13:02.970 --> 01:13:04.680
even though it does seem to be illegal,

1302
01:13:04.710 --> 01:13:07.890
people sort of shrug their shoulders and then no one pursues it and then it just

1303
01:13:07.891 --> 01:13:12.240
kinda goes away.
Yeah.
But there's some stories that for whatever reason,

1304
01:13:12.270 --> 01:13:17.190
like Jamal Shogi did not go away and still still out there.

1305
01:13:17.191 --> 01:13:18.450
Like it was so egregious.

1306
01:13:18.451 --> 01:13:21.990
It's so crazy that this guy walks into the embassy yeah.

1307
01:13:22.110 --> 01:13:24.990
And just never comes out.
And they're like,
oh no,
what happened?

1308
01:13:25.620 --> 01:13:28.740
And then slowly you start getting a different story.

1309
01:13:28.741 --> 01:13:30.540
And then apparently there's leaked,

1310
01:13:30.660 --> 01:13:35.640
there's audio and perhaps even video of his murder.
Yup.
That ordered by the way,

1311
01:13:35.641 --> 01:13:39.320
by someone who was hanging out with Jared questionnaire afterwards,
um,

1312
01:13:39.390 --> 01:13:42.900
with apparently no mention of,
of,
of what happened.
Yeah.

1313
01:13:43.890 --> 01:13:48.420
As a journalist when you see shit like that,
that has got to hit home.

1314
01:13:49.170 --> 01:13:53.170
Uh,
the,
yeah,
the last few years fed for journalists especially,
you know,

1315
01:13:53.340 --> 01:13:55.410
if you're,
I mean he wasn't an American citizen,

1316
01:13:56.130 --> 01:13:58.650
but he did write for the Washington Post and was a resident.
But,

1317
01:13:58.651 --> 01:14:02.040
but I mean I was,
I was,
I was arrested in Iran for a week,
a long,

1318
01:14:02.041 --> 01:14:05.820
long time ago and roughly the same time and Iranian Canadian photographer was

1319
01:14:05.821 --> 01:14:08.190
arrested and she was raped and beaten to death.

1320
01:14:08.790 --> 01:14:12.030
She said that people that are citizens of these countries there,
they're

1321
01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:15.130
<v 0>really,
really bearing the brunt.
Um,
and again,</v>

1322
01:14:15.131 --> 01:14:18.580
that's why I'm uncomfortable if people call me brave because I get to come home

1323
01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:21.040
with these guys,
you know,

1324
01:14:21.100 --> 01:14:24.310
they can get to them and they can get to their families very easily.
And that,

1325
01:14:24.370 --> 01:14:26.980
that takes a whole other level of,
of bravery.

1326
01:14:27.060 --> 01:14:28.830
And the woman who was raped and beaten to death,
what did,

1327
01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:29.950
what was she involved with?

1328
01:14:30.430 --> 01:14:33.280
She was a photographer and she was just taking pictures of,
yeah.
Yeah.

1329
01:14:33.310 --> 01:14:35.680
And the usual thing with,
I mean certainly in Iran,

1330
01:14:35.681 --> 01:14:37.870
but this is common all over the place.

1331
01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:41.810
If you're a dual citizen working as a journalist in for example around,

1332
01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:44.200
and they'll accuse you of being a spy.
I was accused of being a spy.

1333
01:14:44.201 --> 01:14:45.910
They tried to get me to confess to being a spy.

1334
01:14:46.300 --> 01:14:50.020
That's a very normal assumption out there.
And how long were you in jail for?

1335
01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:54.730
Just seven or eight days.
What was that like?
Actually not,
not too bad.
I mean,

1336
01:14:54.731 --> 01:14:57.580
psychologically it was bad because they were threatening torture and execution.

1337
01:14:57.720 --> 01:15:02.080
Um,
physically it wasn't,
it wasn't too bad.
I was fed.
Um,
I had a bad bed.

1338
01:15:02.081 --> 01:15:05.140
I was roughed up a bit.
I wasn't,
I wasn't beaten.
Um,

1339
01:15:05.170 --> 01:15:07.570
but I did think it could last months and months and months.

1340
01:15:07.571 --> 01:15:09.880
And I did think I could go to Evin prison,

1341
01:15:09.900 --> 01:15:12.520
actually put me in a car and drove me to what they said was in prison once and

1342
01:15:12.521 --> 01:15:14.270
then just took me somewhere else.
Evan prison,

1343
01:15:14.271 --> 01:15:17.680
even prisoners where people have been tortured and executed.

1344
01:15:17.830 --> 01:15:19.360
So they just drove you little scarier.

1345
01:15:19.690 --> 01:15:22.330
Drove me around for a few hours to scare me and then took me to another place

1346
01:15:22.331 --> 01:15:25.180
here.
What were they trying to get you to confess to being a spy?

1347
01:15:25.630 --> 01:15:27.140
And they said at one point they said,
uh,

1348
01:15:27.700 --> 01:15:30.940
do you honestly expect us to believe you travel the world collecting all this

1349
01:15:30.941 --> 01:15:34.510
information and you don't share it with your government?
I said,
yeah,

1350
01:15:34.511 --> 01:15:35.860
that's exactly how it works.

1351
01:15:36.340 --> 01:15:39.380
And they thought I was insulting their intelligence by,
by saying that.

1352
01:15:41.020 --> 01:15:43.960
What were you over there covering?
We were,
I did a series.

1353
01:15:43.961 --> 01:15:46.540
One of the first series I did was called holidays in the axis of evil.

1354
01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:50.710
So I spent my first four years as a journalist undercover wearing a secret

1355
01:15:50.711 --> 01:15:51.544
camera.

1356
01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:55.930
And Luckily I appeared on a couple of docs with a guy who was not very good.

1357
01:15:56.170 --> 01:16:00.570
And so I looked genuine next to him.
Um,
so the controller,

1358
01:16:00.590 --> 01:16:04.540
BBC Two said,
give this guy a series.
And I was racking my brains trying to think,

1359
01:16:04.541 --> 01:16:07.810
wanting to be a foreign correspondent and wanting to cover conflict.

1360
01:16:08.470 --> 01:16:12.700
Then George Bush made the axis of evil speech and John Bolton added three

1361
01:16:12.701 --> 01:16:16.960
countries to the list.
So it was Iraq,
Syria,
Cuba,
North Korea,

1362
01:16:17.630 --> 01:16:22.570
uh,
Libya,
Cuba with a six evil countries.
So we went to all six countries.

1363
01:16:22.990 --> 01:16:26.020
Me and one camera man held out,
handheld camera chain,

1364
01:16:26.021 --> 01:16:28.060
actually saw it and that's when he first reached out.

1365
01:16:28.061 --> 01:16:30.400
And I started talking to vice about eventually joining them,

1366
01:16:30.970 --> 01:16:34.960
but kind of documentaries from the streets up to,
we're just trying to say,

1367
01:16:35.020 --> 01:16:37.300
you know,
despite all the rhetoric about Iran,

1368
01:16:37.330 --> 01:16:40.870
this is what the people are actually like.
And it was,
it was kind of use led.
We,

1369
01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:44.080
we interviewed a bunch of students who are involved in some famous protests in

1370
01:16:44.081 --> 01:16:47.830
1999 where the police came in and smashed the dormitories and burned them down

1371
01:16:47.831 --> 01:16:50.200
and beat them.
I think because we interviewed them,

1372
01:16:50.201 --> 01:16:55.120
we would then tracked and arrested.
Oh,
so how'd you get it free?

1373
01:16:56.040 --> 01:16:59.110
How do I get,
how'd you get free?
Uh,
it's,
I didn't know at the time,

1374
01:16:59.111 --> 01:17:01.600
but if to come 10 countries have diplomatic relations.

1375
01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:05.830
It's only a big deal after a week.
So on the night of the seventh day or the,

1376
01:17:05.890 --> 01:17:08.920
or the eighth day,
they,
they let me go.
Oh yeah.

1377
01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:11.210
I had no idea at the time.
I thought,

1378
01:17:11.211 --> 01:17:13.730
I thought this could go on months and months.
A month.

1379
01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:18.170
Now when you were over there in around what is their perception of the United

1380
01:17:18.170 --> 01:17:21.390
States?
When you talk to the young people over there?
Oh,
uh,

1381
01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:25.130
love the United States real music culture,
sports,

1382
01:17:25.460 --> 01:17:29.900
everything and extremely well educated about the United States.
Um,

1383
01:17:30.650 --> 01:17:34.610
American foreign policy is a completely different discussion,
but I mean,

1384
01:17:34.611 --> 01:17:38.600
one of the things we tried to cover was the Friday rally at Tehran University

1385
01:17:38.601 --> 01:17:41.030
where you see everyone chanting death to America,
death to Israel.

1386
01:17:41.630 --> 01:17:44.630
And we went to cover it because they bus in old men from the countryside.

1387
01:17:45.070 --> 01:17:47.620
You sit there going,
ah,
yeah,
death to America,
death to Israel else.

1388
01:17:47.630 --> 01:17:51.980
Yet it's not something to be seeking some propaganda staged event.
Yeah.

1389
01:17:52.010 --> 01:17:57.010
I mean if there was a turning point in Iraq and Afghanistan wars and with Iran,

1390
01:17:58.310 --> 01:18:02.900
Ryan Crocker,
who was the former ambassador to Saudi Arabia,
Israel,
Iraq,

1391
01:18:02.930 --> 01:18:05.600
Afghanistan,
straight off the nine 11,

1392
01:18:05.660 --> 01:18:10.220
he was sent to Geneva where a number of countries affected by the refugee
crisis.

1393
01:18:10.221 --> 01:18:11.810
We're meeting to discuss how to deal with it,

1394
01:18:11.930 --> 01:18:14.540
one of the countries that are wrong so that have this meeting.

1395
01:18:14.541 --> 01:18:17.390
And then he and his Iranian counterpart would disappear for,

1396
01:18:17.391 --> 01:18:22.391
he says seven or eight hours over a to discuss the future of American Iran

1397
01:18:22.940 --> 01:18:27.500
relations.
They knew that they were going to get rid of the Taliban.
Um,

1398
01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:31.040
so the Uranian said,
okay,
here's a map of the Taliban leaders homes.

1399
01:18:31.700 --> 01:18:33.260
If you take out those homes on day one,

1400
01:18:33.620 --> 01:18:36.680
Taliban have finished and Ryan Crocker setup.
Thank you.
Can I,

1401
01:18:36.710 --> 01:18:40.310
can I take notes from this map?
They said,
the map is yours.
We made it for you.

1402
01:18:40.610 --> 01:18:42.280
Gave him the map.
Uh,

1403
01:18:42.490 --> 01:18:45.680
let the Americans use Iranian airspace handed over some prisoners.

1404
01:18:46.250 --> 01:18:49.610
They were absolutely key in us overthrowing the Taliban so quickly.

1405
01:18:49.820 --> 01:18:51.500
And Ryan Crocker was making good progress.

1406
01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:55.460
And then talking about the future of Iraq post Saddam,

1407
01:18:56.330 --> 01:19:00.620
one night he gets a knock on his door
and two of his staff has come in and say,

1408
01:19:00.621 --> 01:19:03.260
boss,
you'll,
you're really not going to like what's just happened.
And he said,

1409
01:19:03.261 --> 01:19:07.760
what's just happened?
And it was the axis of evil speech.
So the moderate,

1410
01:19:07.780 --> 01:19:12.680
so so-called in Iran who had fought hard to get permission to negotiate with the

1411
01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:17.030
Great Satan,
the u s said,
you've made us look stupid.
You know,

1412
01:19:17.031 --> 01:19:19.700
it was hard for us to get this chance.
We helped you in Afghanistan.

1413
01:19:19.701 --> 01:19:24.260
We were willing to discuss future relations between our two countries and,

1414
01:19:24.261 --> 01:19:28.370
and this is,
this is what happens.
So it's over.
Wow.

1415
01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:29.720
And then fairly soon after that,

1416
01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:33.170
obviously there was the invasion of Iraq and Iran is sponsoring the insurgency

1417
01:19:33.171 --> 01:19:36.890
and giving them sophisticated ids and all that rather than,
you know,

1418
01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:38.240
potentially helping.

1419
01:19:39.650 --> 01:19:43.670
So you think that with wow,
with one speech,

1420
01:19:45.110 --> 01:19:47.900
yeah,
the whole thing shifted.
Yeah.
So they would,

1421
01:19:47.930 --> 01:19:52.310
they would have been willing to somehow or another and negotiate or cooperate or

1422
01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:55.370
I mean at work alongside getting rid of Sudan was obviously in,

1423
01:19:55.570 --> 01:19:58.320
in their interests.
You know,
they put a brutal eight year,
eight year with,

1424
01:19:58.490 --> 01:20:01.220
we have a very strange relationship with Iran.
I mean,

1425
01:20:01.370 --> 01:20:06.050
going back to the hostages from,
you know,
the Jimmy Carter era.
Yup.

1426
01:20:06.260 --> 01:20:09.570
I do think it's one of the most misunderstood countries in the region.
I mean,

1427
01:20:09.571 --> 01:20:12.090
when you actually go there,
um,
you know,

1428
01:20:12.091 --> 01:20:16.410
the people are so smart and so educated and,
and potentially such,

1429
01:20:16.411 --> 01:20:20.910
such good allies.
So what is the key issue?
It's the government.

1430
01:20:21.390 --> 01:20:24.780
Yeah.
Yeah,
yeah.
And you know what I just explained,

1431
01:20:25.650 --> 01:20:28.310
I think they're capable of being far more rational than,

1432
01:20:28.350 --> 01:20:33.060
than the speeches by the crazy old molars would,
would suggest
they proved it.

1433
01:20:33.570 --> 01:20:36.300
Yeah.
And the idea that the Saudis numerati is,

1434
01:20:36.301 --> 01:20:41.250
can somehow bomb the huskies in Yemen into submission and push back Iranian

1435
01:20:41.251 --> 01:20:43.920
influence on their southern border is,
is ridiculous.

1436
01:20:43.921 --> 01:20:46.520
That's just never going to happen.
Um,
and,

1437
01:20:46.540 --> 01:20:50.560
and I think even if you ignore the obvious moral argument,
um,

1438
01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:54.750
just from a pragmatic point of view,
the idea that we should back this,
um,

1439
01:20:54.780 --> 01:20:58.530
unconditionally is ridiculous.
Let's see.
This is just

1440
01:20:58.650 --> 01:21:02.070
<v 3>part of the real problem when you're dealing with world events is trying to</v>

1441
01:21:02.071 --> 01:21:06.660
parse all this stuff out and look at so many different stories from so many

1442
01:21:06.661 --> 01:21:09.210
different parts of the world in so many different areas of conflict.

1443
01:21:09.211 --> 01:21:11.670
And it's almost impossible to pay attention to it all.
Yeah.

1444
01:21:13.140 --> 01:21:15.150
<v 0>Every time I meet people from these countries,
I'm,</v>

1445
01:21:15.860 --> 01:21:19.560
I feel like a fraud because there's so much that they know that I don't know and

1446
01:21:19.561 --> 01:21:22.410
that I should.
Um,
and you know,
I get paid to do this.

1447
01:21:22.411 --> 01:21:25.650
I get paid to pay attention to this for a living and I feel out of my depth

1448
01:21:25.710 --> 01:21:29.310
regularly and that's focusing on the five or six countries that I focus on,

1449
01:21:29.311 --> 01:21:33.480
that alone.
Everything else.
What other countries do you focus on?
Uh,
I mean,

1450
01:21:33.481 --> 01:21:37.910
the last few years it's been Congo quite a bit.
Afghanistan,
mostly Iraq,
uh,

1451
01:21:38.100 --> 01:21:42.090
Yemen of focusing on a lot of the last three,
four years.
Um,

1452
01:21:42.180 --> 01:21:44.550
they're the main ones.
I've been to Brazil recently,

1453
01:21:44.580 --> 01:21:47.430
been to Central African Republic recently,
but,
but

1454
01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:50.660
<v 3>now I've talked to a friend of mine who's from Brazil who has a completely</v>

1455
01:21:50.661 --> 01:21:53.720
different take on the new leader of Brazil.

1456
01:21:54.380 --> 01:21:56.900
Like he's more positive about it.

1457
01:21:56.990 --> 01:21:59.120
And then I've talked to other people that say he's a monster.

1458
01:21:59.480 --> 01:22:01.910
<v 0>Yeah.
Um,
I mean,</v>

1459
01:22:01.911 --> 01:22:05.030
if people in Brazil are living through the current chaos,

1460
01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:07.450
I can understand why they might go to a detailed,

1461
01:22:07.451 --> 01:22:11.120
a type figure to say it's going to be messy,
but he's going to clean it up.
Right.

1462
01:22:11.270 --> 01:22:14.390
But he certainly seemed like a monster.
Yeah.

1463
01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:15.593
<v 3>They,</v>

1464
01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:20.110
they're experiencing some crazy economic crisis as well,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.

1465
01:22:20.170 --> 01:22:23.610
<v 0>And it was the fastest growing economy in Latin America was booming.
Yeah.</v>

1466
01:22:23.620 --> 01:22:27.040
It was just a few years ago.
So it's like this roller coaster ride.

1467
01:22:27.340 --> 01:22:31.180
We did a film there recently and uh,
I met Mike at the numbers slightly wrong,

1468
01:22:31.181 --> 01:22:36.181
but the amount of people that were murdered in Brazil in 2017 I believe it was,

1469
01:22:36.671 --> 01:22:39.910
was double more than double the amount that were murdered in Syria.

1470
01:22:40.390 --> 01:22:43.990
She's 72,000 yeah.

1471
01:22:44.170 --> 01:22:46.580
And after the World Cup and Olympics,
the,

1472
01:22:46.590 --> 01:22:50.680
the trafficking gangs and the police malicious just retook all of those areas

1473
01:22:50.681 --> 01:22:52.530
that were pacified to,
to,
you know,

1474
01:22:52.540 --> 01:22:55.810
protect the tourists during the World Cup and Olympics so that violence has just

1475
01:22:55.811 --> 01:23:00.280
come right back to the fellas
say again.

1476
01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:03.670
There's just so much shit to pay attention to.
Yeah.
And Rio,

1477
01:23:03.671 --> 01:23:08.380
the image Rio is still,
you know,
sand bar on the beach and I've been a few times,

1478
01:23:08.410 --> 01:23:12.700
right?
Yeah.
I've been for UFC events,
it's beautiful people.
Very nice,

1479
01:23:12.701 --> 01:23:15.430
very friendly.
But then you go two or three miles up into the hills,

1480
01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:19.060
it's another world while we drove,
when you land at the airport,

1481
01:23:19.061 --> 01:23:23.680
you drive through the favelas on the way to Rio and you're like,
Whoa,
this is a,

1482
01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:28.210
this is a different kind of poverty.
And during the World Cup and Olympics,

1483
01:23:28.211 --> 01:23:31.600
they put billboards next to that road to block the view of the favelas.

1484
01:23:31.660 --> 01:23:34.870
Did they rely on those billboards are now starting to fall apart and you can now

1485
01:23:35.070 --> 01:23:37.630
see and see it again.
Yeah.
Wow.
And you can hear it if you,

1486
01:23:37.631 --> 01:23:39.130
if you stay close to their,
you'll hear.
I mean,

1487
01:23:39.131 --> 01:23:41.710
we went into the favelas many times.

1488
01:23:41.711 --> 01:23:46.380
We saw one guy who was suspected of being a police informer.
Um,
so the,

1489
01:23:46.381 --> 01:23:49.270
the trafficking gangs had captured him slash her his leg.

1490
01:23:49.271 --> 01:23:53.860
So he was laying on the ground,
put four rifle to his head and just unloaded.

1491
01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:58.120
And his chin was still kind of where it should be.
But everything else was,

1492
01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:01.050
this is when you got there.
Well,
because there,
right afterwards,
sorry.
No,

1493
01:24:01.060 --> 01:24:03.970
we didn't witness it happening and we've got there right afterwards.
But yeah,

1494
01:24:03.971 --> 01:24:08.200
it's,
it's,
I mean,
hideous violence there on,
I'm on a massive scale.

1495
01:24:08.590 --> 01:24:11.860
And also I got into an argument with him the other day about this,
um,

1496
01:24:12.700 --> 01:24:17.230
deeply racist.
Uh,
you know,
the,
the,
the rich be minima tend to be white,

1497
01:24:17.380 --> 01:24:20.830
European descendants.
The poor kids getting shot in the favelas,
uh,

1498
01:24:20.950 --> 01:24:25.360
almost all black.
And if you walk into a bar and Ipanema with a black girl,

1499
01:24:25.540 --> 01:24:26.950
everyone will assume she's a prostitute.

1500
01:24:27.370 --> 01:24:30.770
If you walk into a bar and if an email with a black guy,
everyone was humans,

1501
01:24:30.790 --> 01:24:34.000
a drug dealer.
Um,
and again,
the exact opposite of,

1502
01:24:34.001 --> 01:24:38.520
of the public image of sort of Brazil Ipanema is the more wealthy area because

1503
01:24:38.521 --> 01:24:42.950
there is,
yeah,
that's the very best as the very wealthy,
Nice Beach,
um,

1504
01:24:43.390 --> 01:24:45.940
area with all the Nice hotels and apartment blocks.

1505
01:24:45.970 --> 01:24:48.760
But they still must get robbed all the time down there.
Right.

1506
01:24:49.090 --> 01:24:52.720
It used to be that the violence was separated from the ready,
which areas,

1507
01:24:52.721 --> 01:24:56.090
but there are now a lot of wealthy Brazilians leaving because it's,
it's,

1508
01:24:56.100 --> 01:24:57.770
it's affecting everywhere now.
I mean,
the,

1509
01:24:57.780 --> 01:25:00.940
one of the experts we interviewed in the last film said,
um,

1510
01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:05.710
I believe it was one in three Rio residents will get caught in crossfire at some

1511
01:25:05.711 --> 01:25:08.410
point over the course of a year.
I might be wrong.

1512
01:25:08.411 --> 01:25:12.610
And I believe it was one in three.
Yeah.
But it was a massive,
massive number.
Yeah.

1513
01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:18.000
Fuck.
Yeah.
I mean if,
if you're anywhere near a favela,
you'll hear it.

1514
01:25:18.001 --> 01:25:22.650
Most Nigel head shots being fired most nights and not like bom,
Bom,
Bom.
You know,

1515
01:25:22.651 --> 01:25:25.770
you'll hear a fight going on to Jesus Christ.

1516
01:25:28.250 --> 01:25:32.900
How much time do you spend over there?
Uh,
three weeks I believe it was.
Wow.

1517
01:25:33.620 --> 01:25:37.880
And what are you covering?
Uh,
we did a film about the pacification campaign,

1518
01:25:37.881 --> 01:25:40.790
the police and army clearing the favelas before the World Cup Olympics.

1519
01:25:40.791 --> 01:25:41.960
So we went back just to see,

1520
01:25:41.961 --> 01:25:45.330
just to sort of illuminated for people to think that this is what Brazil's

1521
01:25:45.350 --> 01:25:47.660
actually lark and see what yeah,
what happened afterwards.

1522
01:25:48.260 --> 01:25:51.590
And those areas were abandoned as soon as the World Cup and Olympics were over.

1523
01:25:53.100 --> 01:25:57.140
Dude,
I don't know how you do this.
You're so friendly too.

1524
01:25:57.141 --> 01:26:00.270
Like he's so easy going live here.
He seems so peaceful.

1525
01:26:00.750 --> 01:26:04.400
Like you don't seem like a shell shocked

1526
01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:09.020
<v 2>guy,
you know,
you really don't.
You seem very,</v>

1527
01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:13.550
very even.
Oh that's,
that's,
that's good to here.
Six months ago.

1528
01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:18.460
Yeah.
I mean,
I think I still have PTSD,
but it definitely helped.

1529
01:26:18.461 --> 01:26:21.020
And I bumped into a friend of mine,
the Diet Dan Reed,

1530
01:26:21.021 --> 01:26:23.840
who made the Michael Jackson documentary.
I saw him in New York a few weeks,

1531
01:26:23.841 --> 01:26:28.410
Neverland.
When you said,
Ben,
you just seem to just seem a bit a bit calmer.
What,

1532
01:26:28.420 --> 01:26:31.190
what is your take on that documentary?
I have not watched it,

1533
01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:36.020
but I've heard that those two guys at testified saying that nothing had ever

1534
01:26:36.021 --> 01:26:37.850
happened to them before this and then,

1535
01:26:37.851 --> 01:26:41.150
then now they're down on their luck and now they've changed their tune and

1536
01:26:41.151 --> 01:26:44.960
saying that it was,
they,
they go into that in detail in the dark and uh,

1537
01:26:44.990 --> 01:26:49.940
basically there'd been replaced by the new young boy to the side.

1538
01:26:49.970 --> 01:26:53.030
And then Michael reached out and said,
I need you to help me.

1539
01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:55.580
And they say it was exciting,
the idea to be,

1540
01:26:56.120 --> 01:26:59.350
to be back in Michael's good books and be wanted by Michael again until they,

1541
01:26:59.351 --> 01:27:00.830
they,
they talk about that very openly.

1542
01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:05.120
I had done it with them a week before the film came out and I believe them

1543
01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:09.290
really?
Yeah.
Yeah.
And,
and one of them certainly I think has,

1544
01:27:09.291 --> 01:27:11.420
has what looks like the symptoms of Ptsd.

1545
01:27:11.421 --> 01:27:15.380
And the other one I think went through therapy before he was able to talk about

1546
01:27:15.381 --> 01:27:18.230
this stuff.
So I don't think they're doing it for,
for financial gain.

1547
01:27:18.860 --> 01:27:22.760
But what did you think about the Dr. Michael Jackson's doctor saying that he was

1548
01:27:22.761 --> 01:27:25.940
chemically castrated?
Oh,
I didn't,
I didn't hear that.

1549
01:27:25.941 --> 01:27:29.540
Who knew that this was something that we've talked about before because his

1550
01:27:29.541 --> 01:27:32.960
voice was so different.
And to me,

1551
01:27:32.961 --> 01:27:36.280
I said a long time ago before his doctor came out and said he was coming

1552
01:27:36.290 --> 01:27:38.480
castrate,
I said,
these sounds are Castrato.

1553
01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:42.840
He sounds like one of those men who are taking his boys and you know,

1554
01:27:42.890 --> 01:27:46.190
the 1,870 he chose to do it.
The doctor saying,
I don't know.

1555
01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:49.770
I think the doctor saying that his father did it to them.
I think that was with,

1556
01:27:49.810 --> 01:27:53.120
this is the doctor that killed him mother.
So take that with a grain of salt.

1557
01:27:53.121 --> 01:27:56.280
Right.
But they were saying that he chemically crashed,

1558
01:27:56.281 --> 01:27:59.180
treated him to preserve his voice.
Which,
you know,

1559
01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:02.150
it sounds preposterous until you look at this frame.
I mean,

1560
01:28:02.151 --> 01:28:05.360
it did not have the frame of a person who takes the kids to run because he was

1561
01:28:05.361 --> 01:28:07.880
the same kids who did not have those kids.
And now he's getting,
not as kids,

1562
01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:09.530
but definitely not as kids.
I mean,

1563
01:28:09.531 --> 01:28:13.020
it's what we're talking to her about how it's easy to get the facts to fit a

1564
01:28:13.021 --> 01:28:15.260
theory.
Right.
But those kids are not his kids.

1565
01:28:15.261 --> 01:28:18.650
Those are the whitest kids you're ever going to look at.
They're really white.

1566
01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:23.060
I mean,
they're not part African American.
I mean,
and he,

1567
01:28:23.061 --> 01:28:27.050
we got to remember before his Videle Lygo kicked in.
He was very dark.
You know,

1568
01:28:27.051 --> 01:28:29.750
he looked like his brothers.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It looked like his father.
Yeah.

1569
01:28:30.270 --> 01:28:33.800
I mean it's,
um,
I dunno,
I hadn't heard that theory before that his kids,

1570
01:28:33.860 --> 01:28:36.560
his kids getting his kids.
Really,
I haven't had many theories.
I'm not,

1571
01:28:36.561 --> 01:28:39.200
I don't think that much about Michael Jackson.
So I mean,

1572
01:28:39.201 --> 01:28:42.140
I think that's just been pretty much established.
Yeah.

1573
01:28:42.141 --> 01:28:43.610
That his kids weren't really as kids.

1574
01:28:43.611 --> 01:28:46.220
And I think is the woman that he had children with.

1575
01:28:46.221 --> 01:28:50.660
I think it was all on the record saying they never had sex.
Like I think,
yeah,

1576
01:28:50.661 --> 01:28:54.560
I think they,
I think they talk about that as well.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I Dunno,
but it's it,

1577
01:28:54.580 --> 01:28:57.650
when we had a similar case in the UK with Jimmy Savile,
like the most popular,

1578
01:28:58.260 --> 01:29:00.590
that's,
that's,
that seems even worse.

1579
01:29:00.620 --> 01:29:02.340
And the documentary is great because it's a portrait

1580
01:29:02.340 --> 01:29:05.100
<v 3>of how you grew them,
not just the kid,
but the family as well.</v>

1581
01:29:05.101 --> 01:29:08.940
And in some ways you grew me entire country to the point where if accusations

1582
01:29:08.941 --> 01:29:13.770
come out,
everyone says,
no,
not him.
No Way.
That's,
that's how it works.

1583
01:29:14.130 --> 01:29:18.750
Or he looked like a monster and Michael Jackson looked like a monster
eventually.

1584
01:29:18.751 --> 01:29:22.190
But when we always go back to him as a boy when he was singing an ABC,

1585
01:29:22.530 --> 01:29:24.330
I mean he was this adorable little kid,

1586
01:29:24.331 --> 01:29:29.160
incredibly talented and so dynamic and exciting to watch.
Like God,

1587
01:29:29.161 --> 01:29:33.600
he's so talented.
Look at him.
And then in thriller,
I mean everybody loved him.

1588
01:29:33.930 --> 01:29:36.210
But Jimmy Savile,
it looks like a monster in retrospect.

1589
01:29:36.211 --> 01:29:39.540
I wrote to him as a kid because he had the show called Jim,
we'll fix it.
Right.

1590
01:29:39.710 --> 01:29:42.120
We had grant you your wish and then you'd sit on his lap and he'd give you a

1591
01:29:42.121 --> 01:29:46.410
medal.
You got off light.
No one thought he was a monster back then.
No one.

1592
01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:49.500
But he was so hideous.
Yeah.
And,
and uh,

1593
01:29:50.010 --> 01:29:51.570
Louis through did a great documentary with him.

1594
01:29:51.571 --> 01:29:55.020
When he says he keeps his mother's bedroom exactly what it was and all the

1595
01:29:55.021 --> 01:29:57.510
clothes hanging in there.
Yeah.
But honestly,

1596
01:29:57.511 --> 01:30:02.160
in his lifetime this was not discussed.
Yeah.
And like I say,

1597
01:30:02.161 --> 01:30:04.110
I think he groomed the entire country.
Well,

1598
01:30:04.111 --> 01:30:09.111
there's so many cases like that where you have this systemic pedophile situation

1599
01:30:09.211 --> 01:30:12.690
that doesn't make sense.
Like,
how did this,
how did this last,

1600
01:30:12.720 --> 01:30:17.130
like Penn state,
like the Sandusky case,
like how did this,
how did,

1601
01:30:17.430 --> 01:30:20.640
everyone seems to have known about it.
How did it last?

1602
01:30:20.820 --> 01:30:24.440
And people had seen a kid in the shower and hadn't,
I mean,
yeah,

1603
01:30:24.510 --> 01:30:25.560
you think now you'd,
you'd,

1604
01:30:26.100 --> 01:30:28.860
you'd kill yourself if you didn't intervene in some way.

1605
01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:32.910
I think it's also easy to forget how much that wasn't part of the conversation

1606
01:30:32.911 --> 01:30:36.560
back then though.
You know the idea that there are pdf files out there and it's,

1607
01:30:36.570 --> 01:30:39.540
it's actually incredibly widespread.
That just wasn't right.

1608
01:30:39.541 --> 01:30:41.790
That wasn't something people were worried about back then from my memory,

1609
01:30:41.791 --> 01:30:46.260
at least.
Anyway,
no,
it was church who was Catholic Church priests.

1610
01:30:46.350 --> 01:30:49.190
We knew about that ever other than that,

1611
01:30:49.191 --> 01:30:54.191
but there was no discussion of like some world famous football coach who was

1612
01:30:54.211 --> 01:30:58.170
secretly fucking kids like that.
You never heard that.
I mean,

1613
01:30:58.950 --> 01:31:01.500
and paternal they think had to have known.

1614
01:31:01.980 --> 01:31:05.200
There's no way he couldn't have known or at least been exposed to some of it
and,

1615
01:31:05.210 --> 01:31:07.370
and to the conversation we had earlier,
I remember that,

1616
01:31:07.371 --> 01:31:11.670
that great documentary where I guide protest in front of the statue and another

1617
01:31:11.671 --> 01:31:15.850
guy comes up and tries to beat him up just for daring to suggest that,
you know,

1618
01:31:15.870 --> 01:31:19.370
this,
this hero of his would be capable of that.
People just,
you know,

1619
01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:23.250
they just can't fathom it because they've been so well groomed and was also Penn

1620
01:31:23.251 --> 01:31:27.040
state.
Football is just sucks.
It's a religion.
It's so important to them it's,

1621
01:31:27.060 --> 01:31:30.330
and to,
to see that these people that were in charge of it,

1622
01:31:30.720 --> 01:31:32.490
we're so fucked up.
Yeah.

1623
01:31:35.070 --> 01:31:37.950
Jesus man's shows a bummer.
Sorry about that.

1624
01:31:39.720 --> 01:31:40.620
But you know,

1625
01:31:40.990 --> 01:31:45.990
do you plan on doing this Mtma therapy on a regular basis and what,

1626
01:31:46.620 --> 01:31:48.680
what sort of an impact do you think?
I mean when,

1627
01:31:48.710 --> 01:31:53.710
when you go over the results of the first therapy where you are almost

1628
01:31:54.031 --> 01:31:56.700
immediately alleviates,
you have a lot of your feelings,

1629
01:31:56.701 --> 01:32:00.430
but you still are thinking about planning your next adventure

1630
01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:04.360
<v 0>and your,
your,
your next project.
Um,
I'm probably gonna do a full session.</v>

1631
01:32:04.390 --> 01:32:06.970
The therapist recommended a full session,
which isn't what they normally do.

1632
01:32:06.971 --> 01:32:08.920
But that said,
I mean,
I thought,

1633
01:32:08.980 --> 01:32:12.370
I thought being able to cry would be a major breakthrough and that's part of

1634
01:32:12.371 --> 01:32:15.910
this therapy.
Um,
and that's,
you do,
you normally can't cry at all.

1635
01:32:15.920 --> 01:32:19.210
I haven't cried since I was 13 years old or something.
14 years old.

1636
01:32:19.211 --> 01:32:24.040
Well that's different because that predates your war correspondents.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1637
01:32:24.220 --> 01:32:26.170
I mean English culture,
it's,
you know,

1638
01:32:26.260 --> 01:32:29.230
my grandparents fought in the war were tough as nails.
It's,
you know,

1639
01:32:29.620 --> 01:32:34.240
there is this pressure to be,
to be tough.
And the first normal therapy session,

1640
01:32:34.300 --> 01:32:38.330
I told her what I thought was quite an everyday story about an experience in war

1641
01:32:38.331 --> 01:32:40.720
to the therapist.
And he cried.
Oh,
Jesus.

1642
01:32:42.280 --> 01:32:45.440
And then the first Mbma session,
the therapist cried,
I don't know,

1643
01:32:45.441 --> 01:32:48.850
two or three times and the camera man cried and I still was still couldn't get

1644
01:32:48.851 --> 01:32:51.200
there.
And then the third session I need,
he did.
And I like,

1645
01:32:51.201 --> 01:32:54.730
my jaw was trembling and I kind of thought,
oh,
there's,
there's going to be this.

1646
01:32:55.480 --> 01:32:59.080
What would it felt like?
A breakthrough and still having camp.
What were,

1647
01:32:59.120 --> 01:33:02.470
what were they crying about?
Uh,

1648
01:33:02.890 --> 01:33:06.910
I can't even remember what stories you just had to show has been a bummer.

1649
01:33:06.911 --> 01:33:09.180
Like the stories,
I just tell him that,
you know,
well,
I mean I'm,

1650
01:33:09.181 --> 01:33:13.050
I'm joking kind of job.
This is what happened.
You're talking about it.

1651
01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:16.720
This is one of the,
you know,
one of the lesser symptoms of doing this is you,

1652
01:33:16.870 --> 01:33:19.330
you turn up to a party or a dinner or something,
you know,

1653
01:33:19.331 --> 01:33:23.080
with people that are enjoying the sell theirselves,
a smiling say,
oh,
this is Ben.

1654
01:33:23.081 --> 01:33:26.950
Ben just come back from,
from Yemen.
I,
what's it like in Yemen,
Ben?
You really,

1655
01:33:27.010 --> 01:33:28.480
really want to know.
Yeah,
tell us.

1656
01:33:28.510 --> 01:33:32.540
And then 10 minutes later there's this dark cloud of the evening and it was just

1657
01:33:32.541 --> 01:33:37.150
like Jesus.
So you just feel like you're,
you know,
you're just killing,

1658
01:33:37.180 --> 01:33:40.320
killing the cutting and the new state.
Can you talk,
Yay.

1659
01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:43.010
I've got bad habit of doing that by,

1660
01:33:43.060 --> 01:33:45.940
I can't even remember what the stories were that the ad that effect,

1661
01:33:46.210 --> 01:33:49.600
what does it like when you go to dinner with fellow war journalists?

1662
01:33:50.770 --> 01:33:54.370
Um,
what do you guys talk about?
I'm not,

1663
01:33:54.820 --> 01:33:57.430
there's a few that were really good friends and we can talk about all this
stuff.

1664
01:33:57.431 --> 01:34:01.570
There's a lot of that.
I'm not,
I'm not that close to and I don't likely,
you know,

1665
01:34:01.571 --> 01:34:04.600
the,
the mutual,
you know,

1666
01:34:05.590 --> 01:34:10.010
backpacking that goes on with it.
And was that what it is?
I kind of think,

1667
01:34:10.011 --> 01:34:12.310
you know,
if you're doing this for a living,
like you,
you,

1668
01:34:12.370 --> 01:34:15.230
you shouldn't be sharing stories with other people who cover that country.
Other,

1669
01:34:15.231 --> 01:34:17.980
the other people from,
you know,
from your background,
from your country,

1670
01:34:18.010 --> 01:34:21.730
you should be talking to the people from that country.
And a lot of journalists,

1671
01:34:21.750 --> 01:34:25.630
I mean,
it's possible in Afghanistan,
in Syria,
in Iraq,
to have a pretty good life.

1672
01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:29.280
You stay in the five star hotel,
you eat well,
drink wine every night and you,

1673
01:34:29.340 --> 01:34:32.440
you know,
you,
you,
you get information from each other.
Right.

1674
01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:36.310
And I think that defeats the point of,
of foreign reporting.
Oh,
I see.

1675
01:34:36.340 --> 01:34:39.610
So consciously or unconsciously,
I,
I'm not,
I'm not,
you know,

1676
01:34:39.750 --> 01:34:42.690
I don't spend a lot of time with,
with other watch enlists there,

1677
01:34:42.700 --> 01:34:44.770
there were those who I deeply admire who I see every now and again,

1678
01:34:44.771 --> 01:34:48.760
like Sebastian younger.
Um,
but I'm not,
I don't,
I don't hang out with them day in,

1679
01:34:48.761 --> 01:34:53.540
day out.
So there's levels to the involvement.
Yeah.
To,
whether,

1680
01:34:53.590 --> 01:34:55.860
how deeply you're immersed and it's,
it's,

1681
01:34:55.861 --> 01:34:58.970
it's completely upside down in the state because the TV,

1682
01:34:58.971 --> 01:35:02.990
new Gen TV news journalists aren't deeply involved and just want to get that

1683
01:35:02.991 --> 01:35:06.710
quick shot of them looking like they're somewhere Middle East and he closest to

1684
01:35:06.711 --> 01:35:09.560
the front line with the flak jacket on the perfectly ironed shirt and they're

1685
01:35:09.561 --> 01:35:13.640
not,
they're not sweating or even worse.
The Brian Williams type situation.
Yeah,

1686
01:35:13.690 --> 01:35:15.800
yeah.
Or on the roof of the five star hotel.

1687
01:35:15.801 --> 01:35:19.190
Sometimes you might see people report about what's happening with Isis and

1688
01:35:19.191 --> 01:35:21.020
they're in Beirut.
Right.

1689
01:35:21.021 --> 01:35:23.720
And I think they're relying on the fact that a lot of people don't understand

1690
01:35:23.721 --> 01:35:27.170
that it's a different country.
Um,
but you know,
those guys,

1691
01:35:27.171 --> 01:35:30.500
some of those guys are paid millions and treated very,
very well.

1692
01:35:30.920 --> 01:35:34.850
The photographers and print journalists who are immersed and I spending weeks

1693
01:35:34.851 --> 01:35:38.450
there sometimes struggling to make a living and aren't well known and aren't

1694
01:35:38.451 --> 01:35:39.284
well supported.

1695
01:35:39.380 --> 01:35:43.550
What is it about the talking head in front of the camera that we want so badly?

1696
01:35:44.260 --> 01:35:47.190
I mean,
I think it's,
it's,
it's a way for the news networks to,

1697
01:35:47.191 --> 01:35:51.500
to claim credibility and then when you see them get deployed,

1698
01:35:51.650 --> 01:35:55.610
they're not focused on getting material from the war in these countries.

1699
01:35:55.610 --> 01:35:56.360
They're focused on the,

1700
01:35:56.360 --> 01:36:01.010
on the two way right now talking Shar guy from wherever.

1701
01:36:01.140 --> 01:36:01.541
Right.

1702
01:36:01.541 --> 01:36:04.520
That's more important than actually spending days collecting footage of what's

1703
01:36:04.521 --> 01:36:05.354
actually going on.

1704
01:36:05.480 --> 01:36:10.480
It seems like you see that rarely if ever these days it's more and more rare.

1705
01:36:10.940 --> 01:36:15.800
It,
it,
it seemed to me that during like Desert Storm,
um,
in the 90s,

1706
01:36:15.860 --> 01:36:20.150
there was always someone that was over there and it seemed like there was real

1707
01:36:20.151 --> 01:36:22.160
threat and it was really going on.

1708
01:36:22.670 --> 01:36:27.670
But now everything seems to be done from the desk and you don't really see a lot

1709
01:36:27.741 --> 01:36:30.680
of,
I mean,
am I right about that?
Yeah.
I mean,
I think in most of the,

1710
01:36:30.681 --> 01:36:32.840
a lot of the major news networks said to their crews,

1711
01:36:32.841 --> 01:36:35.360
you're not allowed to spend the night in Mosul.
You know,

1712
01:36:35.361 --> 01:36:39.350
you can go there and film a street and to be some refugees who just escaped isis

1713
01:36:39.351 --> 01:36:41.540
territory,
but you can't spend days on end there.

1714
01:36:41.990 --> 01:36:44.060
Whereas the freelance photographers and some of the writers,

1715
01:36:44.061 --> 01:36:47.240
they were spending days on end there and getting,
getting the real stuff.

1716
01:36:47.300 --> 01:36:51.890
Is it because the on camera people will be targeted?
Um,

1717
01:36:52.010 --> 01:36:54.830
I just think the risk is too high,
full stop for the entire crew.

1718
01:36:54.920 --> 01:36:56.120
And certainly if you know,

1719
01:36:56.121 --> 01:36:58.970
when a story is really big and you send one of the very well known

1720
01:36:59.210 --> 01:37:02.110
correspondence there,
then yeah,
they can't be running around,
um,
you know,

1721
01:37:02.180 --> 01:37:03.560
filming house to house fighting.

1722
01:37:03.770 --> 01:37:07.280
So when you're over there and you see these guys show up and you know that

1723
01:37:07.281 --> 01:37:10.670
they're just going to be hanging out with the hotel and what does that feel in

1724
01:37:10.671 --> 01:37:14.770
like,
uh,
yeah,
I mean,
I'm pretty disdainful of those.
Yeah.

1725
01:37:14.810 --> 01:37:19.330
Those guys you have to be,
yeah.
Yeah.
It's funny you see these films like,
um,

1726
01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:22.760
whiskey,
tango,
Foxtrot about Afghanistan and I just,
yeah,

1727
01:37:23.420 --> 01:37:26.280
I just don't recognize that,
that world that,
you know,
partying every night,

1728
01:37:26.430 --> 01:37:27.910
whatever bar or restaurant.
I just,

1729
01:37:28.190 --> 01:37:31.190
I just think if you're there and you're obviously in the wrong place,
right,

1730
01:37:31.191 --> 01:37:34.460
right.
And it's not,
it's not an adventure,
you know,

1731
01:37:34.461 --> 01:37:37.390
it's not a fun trip for you of,
of wild times and you know,
it,

1732
01:37:37.570 --> 01:37:41.210
it shouldn't be that.
It should be,
um,
I mean from,

1733
01:37:41.211 --> 01:37:43.160
it feels like an endurance test every time you go.

1734
01:37:43.161 --> 01:37:46.520
It should be hard and you should be spending time with the people you're

1735
01:37:46.521 --> 01:37:48.440
covering.
And you know,
sometimes you can,

1736
01:37:48.470 --> 01:37:51.470
you can think you've finished with someone and just go for dinner or tea.

1737
01:37:51.530 --> 01:37:53.330
And just by having normal human conversations,

1738
01:37:53.331 --> 01:37:56.190
you find out so much other stuff that you didn't code that to report.
And yeah,

1739
01:37:56.220 --> 01:37:59.010
that's,
that's,
that's what you have to be doing.
And that takes weeks,

1740
01:37:59.610 --> 01:38:03.420
weeks of getting closer to them and gain their trust.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
And just,

1741
01:38:03.421 --> 01:38:06.200
just,
just,
you know,
spending enough time there where you,

1742
01:38:06.250 --> 01:38:09.390
you then end up being in the right place at the right time to show something

1743
01:38:09.391 --> 01:38:12.000
really happening.
I mean,
in Mosul,
we filmed a,

1744
01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:14.550
the Iraqi army attacking a house where Isis,

1745
01:38:14.551 --> 01:38:17.550
we're shooting from the house and there were three or four families in the
house.

1746
01:38:18.120 --> 01:38:22.440
Um,
so the Iraqi army shot at Isis or the isis guys went down and encourage the

1747
01:38:22.441 --> 01:38:24.030
families to run towards us.

1748
01:38:24.540 --> 01:38:29.220
And just seeing that moment of civilians fleeing and escaping isis for the first

1749
01:38:29.221 --> 01:38:31.800
time after three years.
And when they turned the corner and tore us,

1750
01:38:31.801 --> 01:38:34.650
they knew that made it and they just collapsed to the ground.

1751
01:38:34.651 --> 01:38:36.570
They were kissing the ground,
they were hugging each other.

1752
01:38:37.110 --> 01:38:40.350
Now those are the moments you,
you,
you're,
you're,
you're trying to capture,
I mean,

1753
01:38:40.410 --> 01:38:44.400
I've never seen relief like Jesus Christ.

1754
01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:48.750
And how do they get them out of there?
What do they do from that stage?
Uh,
I mean,

1755
01:38:48.751 --> 01:38:52.140
they'll eventually walk out of Mosul itself and then there are people that can

1756
01:38:52.141 --> 01:38:55.200
take them to the,
the IDP camps around there and what,
we'll get them though,

1757
01:38:55.201 --> 01:38:58.260
you know,
the basic services they need and,
and medical services,
but there's not,

1758
01:38:58.470 --> 01:38:59.460
there's not much of that there.

1759
01:38:59.490 --> 01:39:03.290
And that that was the shocking in Yemen was the places that the Saudis numerati

1760
01:39:03.300 --> 01:39:07.980
said,
we're being so well supplied with food and water and tents and medical

1761
01:39:07.981 --> 01:39:11.720
facilities just,
just weren't at all.
We took no position.

1762
01:39:12.180 --> 01:39:16.040
We talked about Syria early,
you know,
half the population,
Brad's displaced.
Uh,

1763
01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:18.090
you know,
you're talking about,
you know,
12,

1764
01:39:18.091 --> 01:39:22.560
13 million people internally displaced or fled,
uh,
you know,

1765
01:39:23.220 --> 01:39:25.050
just unimaginable,
unimaginable.

1766
01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:29.910
And it's one of the biggest controversies in this country in terms of what to do

1767
01:39:30.180 --> 01:39:33.060
when the refugees come.
What,
what,
what do you do?

1768
01:39:33.061 --> 01:39:36.480
Some countries are taking them in with open arms.
Some countries are not.

1769
01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:40.020
And there's a lot of people that are concentrating on the negative aspects of

1770
01:39:40.021 --> 01:39:43.470
taking these people in new communicate community.
Um,
what,
what is your,

1771
01:39:43.471 --> 01:39:47.320
what is your take on watching all this thing happen?
Why watching all this?
I was,

1772
01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:49.800
I spent a Friday and Saturday in,

1773
01:39:49.801 --> 01:39:53.160
I'm in Houston with a group of Afghan interpreters who had been with in

1774
01:39:53.161 --> 01:39:57.150
Afghanistan who got the special immigrant visas and came to America with their,

1775
01:39:57.180 --> 01:39:58.890
with their families.
Um,

1776
01:39:58.920 --> 01:40:02.940
I cannot think of a better group of people who are contributing to,
to life here.

1777
01:40:03.030 --> 01:40:07.050
I mean,
on the Saturday morning they were,
they were running a food bank.
Um,

1778
01:40:07.110 --> 01:40:10.920
they've got jobs,
they're paying taxes.
Um,
yeah,

1779
01:40:10.921 --> 01:40:14.970
I mean I think we should welcome them with open arms.
And I think,
you know,

1780
01:40:15.570 --> 01:40:19.230
despite our moral obligation to do that,
I think we would benefit from,
from,

1781
01:40:19.231 --> 01:40:21.310
from doing it.
And you know,

1782
01:40:22.470 --> 01:40:24.900
we turned away Jewish refugees during World War II.

1783
01:40:25.690 --> 01:40:29.940
You'd think we'd learned from that and say never again.
You know,
um,
if you're,

1784
01:40:29.941 --> 01:40:31.410
if you're an American Christian,

1785
01:40:32.040 --> 01:40:36.160
I think Christianity is fairly clear and what to do with refugees.
Yes.
You know?

1786
01:40:36.390 --> 01:40:40.470
Um,
so,
so the Viton to,
to not only say no to refugees,

1787
01:40:40.471 --> 01:40:44.610
but also to vilify them and say,
oh look,
a lot of them are fighting age males.

1788
01:40:44.940 --> 01:40:48.540
Yeah.
Clearly Isis sneaking in.
I mean,
that's a level of,

1789
01:40:48.780 --> 01:40:53.500
of viciousness and ignorance that I just,
I just can't fathom the ignorance is,

1790
01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:57.970
<v 3>it's,
it's very pervasive,
right?
It's like,</v>

1791
01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:02.140
it's one of these things where we don't eat.
You don't know.
You're,

1792
01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:04.030
you're reading these stories and there is,

1793
01:41:04.031 --> 01:41:08.980
people were telling you these are fighting age males and that we could very well

1794
01:41:08.981 --> 01:41:10.950
be letting isis in to our country.

1795
01:41:10.951 --> 01:41:15.760
We were very well could be letting in these terrorist cells and allowing them to

1796
01:41:15.761 --> 01:41:16.594
come in.

1797
01:41:16.840 --> 01:41:21.840
But we also could be letting families in that this is a country that's made of

1798
01:41:22.181 --> 01:41:22.720
immigrants.

1799
01:41:22.720 --> 01:41:26.140
I mean it's one of the weirdest things in this country that this is a country
so,

1800
01:41:27.490 --> 01:41:31.000
so obsessed with borders and immigration,

1801
01:41:31.300 --> 01:41:35.170
but yet it's comprised entirely of immigrants.
Yeah,
there's a great,
um,

1802
01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:40.000
do you know,
um,
Gary Young,
the purchase less?
No.
Uh,
he interviews Richard Spencer,

1803
01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:42.370
uh,
um,
and Richard spent,

1804
01:41:42.550 --> 01:41:46.660
Gary Young I think makes it a very similar point and which had spent a says
yeah,

1805
01:41:46.661 --> 01:41:50.660
but this country was built by white people.
Um,
you know,
um,
w we,

1806
01:41:50.670 --> 01:41:52.350
we came up with the,
no,
no it was,

1807
01:41:52.351 --> 01:41:55.600
it was literally built by black people carry young says,
he says,
yeah,
yeah,

1808
01:41:55.601 --> 01:41:59.620
but only because we told them how to do it and it's on camera.
Gary Young says,

1809
01:41:59.621 --> 01:42:00.454
you know what,

1810
01:42:00.460 --> 01:42:04.090
I came to see you cause I thought you were the intellectual argument for,

1811
01:42:04.100 --> 01:42:04.990
for supporting Trump.

1812
01:42:05.410 --> 01:42:08.470
So I thought I'd might love Richard Spencer was the heat election.

1813
01:42:08.650 --> 01:42:11.440
Why did he think that?
I don't know.
But he says you're not.

1814
01:42:11.680 --> 01:42:13.870
This is just ridiculous.
And he just shuts down the interview,

1815
01:42:13.871 --> 01:42:15.910
turns around and walks off.
Well,
good for him.

1816
01:42:15.911 --> 01:42:19.990
I don't know anything about Richard Spencer other than he always gets mentioned

1817
01:42:20.140 --> 01:42:23.200
as a white supremacists.
I literally don't know what he stands for,

1818
01:42:23.210 --> 01:42:24.340
what he does or what he says,

1819
01:42:24.580 --> 01:42:29.260
and they will say he's well dressed and with a nice haircut.
This is a,

1820
01:42:29.740 --> 01:42:33.820
yeah,
it's just such a crazy subject.
The idea of,

1821
01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:39.000
I mean it would be nice if the whole world was up to the same standards of

1822
01:42:39.461 --> 01:42:40.294
health and

1823
01:42:41.890 --> 01:42:46.150
prosperity and he didn't have to worry about where you could go if the whole

1824
01:42:46.151 --> 01:42:51.151
world was essentially like the United States where you could go to where the

1825
01:42:51.401 --> 01:42:54.880
good parts were.
You know,
like if you live in Detroit and you save up your money,

1826
01:42:54.881 --> 01:42:58.330
you can move to Florida or wherever you want to go.
I mean,
you can do that.

1827
01:42:58.570 --> 01:43:02.200
This is the beautiful thing about living inside of a country.

1828
01:43:02.740 --> 01:43:04.870
Be fantastic.
If the whole world was like that,

1829
01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:09.040
if you could just kind of go wherever you would prosper and wherever things it'd

1830
01:43:09.041 --> 01:43:10.780
be.
Well,
but this,

1831
01:43:11.020 --> 01:43:13.750
the thing about refugees and other countries where we don't understand their

1832
01:43:13.751 --> 01:43:16.570
language or their culture and then you get scared because you hear that they're

1833
01:43:16.571 --> 01:43:21.190
Muslims were worried about Muslim terrorists and
it's again,

1834
01:43:21.191 --> 01:43:25.150
it's one more piece of information that just,

1835
01:43:25.470 --> 01:43:28.450
it just overwhelms you.
One more.

1836
01:43:28.630 --> 01:43:32.800
One more thing to concentrate on is the difference with the Muslims in the

1837
01:43:32.800 --> 01:43:36.430
Catholic Church and child abuse scandal.
Did a lot of people say,
oh,

1838
01:43:36.431 --> 01:43:39.650
therefore all Christians are suspicious and all Christian,

1839
01:43:39.651 --> 01:43:43.240
the secretly Peter filed,
right.
They're just not telling them no,
they didn't.

1840
01:43:43.330 --> 01:43:46.780
They didn't.
But they deal with,
with Muslims.
Well,
it's fear of the unknown.

1841
01:43:46.930 --> 01:43:50.890
You know,
it's a lot of it.
The languages and the,
the fact that we're,

1842
01:43:51.770 --> 01:43:52.460
you know,

1843
01:43:52.460 --> 01:43:57.380
<v 0>there's also this,
there has to be this feeling that we've invaded their country,</v>

1844
01:43:57.890 --> 01:44:00.860
several countries and been there for a long time.

1845
01:44:00.980 --> 01:44:04.210
And there's a deep seated resentment that,
you know,
there's the,

1846
01:44:04.211 --> 01:44:08.750
the thought of every time you accidentally blow up a wedding party with a drone,

1847
01:44:08.751 --> 01:44:13.430
every time you kill civilians,
every,
any times,
any collateral damage,

1848
01:44:13.431 --> 01:44:18.080
you are creating untold numbers of people that hate the United States.

1849
01:44:18.100 --> 01:44:20.840
You would think that I,
you know,
having traveled to much of this countries,

1850
01:44:20.880 --> 01:44:22.280
I don't see,
don't see that.

1851
01:44:22.281 --> 01:44:25.010
And yesterday I was interviewing the Afghan interpreters and I said,

1852
01:44:25.040 --> 01:44:27.830
what do you think about negotiating with the Taliban?
I mean,
in one case,

1853
01:44:27.850 --> 01:44:31.270
a good friend of mine called [inaudible],
um,
who's,
who's now living in,

1854
01:44:31.271 --> 01:44:33.320
in Houston.
I said,
um,
you know,

1855
01:44:33.321 --> 01:44:36.710
these guys killed your brother because you were working for the Americans and

1856
01:44:36.711 --> 01:44:37.544
interpreter.

1857
01:44:37.760 --> 01:44:40.490
So how do you feel about the Americans now doing a deal with the Taliban?

1858
01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:44.900
And what about if the u s leaves and the Taliban finishes off the government and

1859
01:44:44.901 --> 01:44:47.030
then comes after your family?
He said,
you know what,

1860
01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:48.710
America's not going to let that happen.

1861
01:44:49.610 --> 01:44:53.780
America has so much power and those what to do that they will make sure that any

1862
01:44:53.781 --> 01:44:57.170
agreement they reached with the Taliban will be enforceable and it will be safe.

1863
01:44:57.740 --> 01:45:02.060
He had so much faith in me,
far more than me.
Wow.
And that's,

1864
01:45:02.061 --> 01:45:05.670
that's what I hear far more often than,
than the opposite is it,

1865
01:45:05.671 --> 01:45:08.930
does that really depend on where you go?
I mean,
cause if you go certain places,

1866
01:45:08.931 --> 01:45:11.720
people have a lot of faith in Trump,
you know,

1867
01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:14.180
like Donald Trump's going to protect us from evil.
There's,

1868
01:45:14.210 --> 01:45:17.540
there's places where you go that,
I mean,
it's become a cliche,
but,

1869
01:45:17.550 --> 01:45:18.410
but I do think you'll,

1870
01:45:18.411 --> 01:45:20.900
you'll find a lot of places critical of American foreign policy.

1871
01:45:21.410 --> 01:45:24.950
That doesn't mean they're critical of America.
How do they parse that out?

1872
01:45:25.940 --> 01:45:30.890
Um,
I think,
I mean,
Vietnam I think is a good example.
You know,

1873
01:45:30.891 --> 01:45:31.361
we,
we,

1874
01:45:31.361 --> 01:45:36.230
we have defeated communism or communism has been defeated in Vietnam just

1875
01:45:36.231 --> 01:45:40.400
because the new generation grow up and think western culture,
communism.

1876
01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:44.120
I know which one I want.
It's a simple choice.
Um,

1877
01:45:44.180 --> 01:45:45.650
and I think that young generation is,

1878
01:45:45.651 --> 01:45:49.190
is making that very simple choice and it could just mean democracy.

1879
01:45:49.280 --> 01:45:51.800
And you think that is in Afghanistan as well.
Yeah.

1880
01:45:51.920 --> 01:45:55.760
That they're recognizing that western culture provides more freedom and more

1881
01:45:55.761 --> 01:46:00.470
economic opportunity,
more prosperity.
Yeah.
Um,
and I haven't heard,

1882
01:46:00.471 --> 01:46:01.550
apart from from the Taliban,

1883
01:46:01.551 --> 01:46:05.390
I haven't heard much anti American feeling in Afghanistan at all really.

1884
01:46:05.480 --> 01:46:06.590
And also a lot of that,
I mean,

1885
01:46:06.860 --> 01:46:09.830
maybe I'm biased because a lot of the people I'm talking to add interactions

1886
01:46:09.831 --> 01:46:12.200
with,
with Americans.
Um,

1887
01:46:12.410 --> 01:46:16.940
but they would even say as many mistakes were made in the prosecuting of the war

1888
01:46:17.270 --> 01:46:19.040
with air strikes and nitrates and all that,

1889
01:46:19.100 --> 01:46:22.670
the American soldiers and Marines we met,
we knew were good people.

1890
01:46:23.540 --> 01:46:27.400
Um,
and,
and like I said,
with,
with,
with Roche,
my interpreter,
it's,

1891
01:46:27.401 --> 01:46:31.770
it's incredible how many people still believe that to this day.
Um,

1892
01:46:31.820 --> 01:46:34.460
there are conspiracy theories.
So for example,
in Iraq,

1893
01:46:34.461 --> 01:46:38.330
you'll hear a lot of people say,
well,
Isis must have been part of America's plan.

1894
01:46:38.780 --> 01:46:42.680
And competence cannot explain what happened in Iraq.
This cannot be a mistake.

1895
01:46:43.070 --> 01:46:45.860
A lot of people believe that.
A lot of people believe that over here as well.

1896
01:46:45.890 --> 01:46:49.980
Right?
Yeah.
But that still doesn't mean they'll hate all Americans and America.

1897
01:46:50.190 --> 01:46:53.730
Um,
and it means a lot of them would love to visit and maybe even come and live

1898
01:46:53.731 --> 01:46:57.990
here.
Is that anything that you take seriously though,
those conspiracy theories?

1899
01:46:57.990 --> 01:47:00.080
Is there any validity to any of that stuff?

1900
01:47:00.290 --> 01:47:04.470
The massive failures in Iraq and Afghanistan have done massive damage to the u s

1901
01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:07.290
on the world stage.
There's no way the u s benefits from,

1902
01:47:07.291 --> 01:47:09.780
from what's what's happened.
I mean,
you know,

1903
01:47:09.960 --> 01:47:14.880
the Taliban would have done a deal in 2002 where they got almost nothing 18

1904
01:47:14.881 --> 01:47:17.190
years later,
$1 trillion later,

1905
01:47:17.970 --> 01:47:20.220
tens of thousands of lives later.

1906
01:47:20.790 --> 01:47:24.330
We're now negotiating with the Taliban where they might get a very good deal.

1907
01:47:24.810 --> 01:47:29.100
That's a massive humiliation for the u s and also Iran,
Russia,

1908
01:47:29.130 --> 01:47:33.450
his below others know that the u s is not going to intervene and lots of

1909
01:47:33.451 --> 01:47:36.720
countries,
so they're doing whatever they want and almost gloating about it,

1910
01:47:37.050 --> 01:47:38.800
knowing full well that America just doesn't,

1911
01:47:38.801 --> 01:47:42.540
it has this have the public support to intervene anywhere else for a very long

1912
01:47:42.541 --> 01:47:46.320
time.
What's the predominant conspiracy theory that they want to prolong this war

1913
01:47:46.321 --> 01:47:51.030
because of the military industrial complex because they're ma spending tons of

1914
01:47:51.031 --> 01:47:55.770
money and yeah,
gaining contracts and oil obviously in Iraq.
How many cars?

1915
01:47:55.771 --> 01:47:59.850
I as,
as I said to me,
do you think America failed in Afghanistan?
And I said,

1916
01:47:59.851 --> 01:48:03.570
of course I'd do it.
Like every film of maids like explains exactly how.

1917
01:48:04.080 --> 01:48:06.390
And he says,
no,
I think,
I think this is exactly what they want.

1918
01:48:06.480 --> 01:48:10.140
They want us being attacked on all sides by extremists.
So we will bow to their,

1919
01:48:10.200 --> 01:48:15.000
to their every wish.
And what do you say to that?
Um,
I mean,
you know,

1920
01:48:15.001 --> 01:48:18.810
he's,
he's met far more senior people than me,
so it's harder to argue with him.

1921
01:48:18.811 --> 01:48:22.200
But yeah,
I don't give that theory any,
any thought whatsoever.

1922
01:48:22.380 --> 01:48:24.600
That's the creepiest thought whatsoever,

1923
01:48:24.601 --> 01:48:27.150
is that the government wants these perpetual wars.
I mean,

1924
01:48:27.151 --> 01:48:30.570
that is the scariest conspiracy theory.
I'm not saying I support it,

1925
01:48:30.571 --> 01:48:35.430
but if you wanted to consider a conspiracy theory,

1926
01:48:35.431 --> 01:48:36.720
that's truly terrifying.

1927
01:48:37.110 --> 01:48:41.250
It's that they keep perpetual wars going on so that they can profit.

1928
01:48:41.850 --> 01:48:46.810
And you know,
George Hw Bush,
Bill Clinton benefited from airstrikes.

1929
01:48:47.080 --> 01:48:50.790
You know,
there's a quick possible bump in terms of your approval ratings.

1930
01:48:51.260 --> 01:48:55.890
That's been proven many times.
Um,
but these wars,
Iraq and Afghanistan,
you know,

1931
01:48:55.891 --> 01:48:58.830
having gone so long yeah.
And resulted in an,

1932
01:48:58.831 --> 01:49:02.610
I think a humiliating defeat in both countries.
Um,

1933
01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:04.620
no one's benefiting from that.
Well,

1934
01:49:04.621 --> 01:49:07.620
there's a numbness that this country has towards them now.

1935
01:49:08.100 --> 01:49:12.750
It's been so many generations.
It's been so many years.
There's so many.
I mean,

1936
01:49:13.320 --> 01:49:14.153
what,
what,

1937
01:49:14.170 --> 01:49:17.730
what are the numbers of troops that have gone over to Afghanistan and Iraq and

1938
01:49:17.731 --> 01:49:18.260
come back?

1939
01:49:18.260 --> 01:49:22.080
It's just and not come back to there's this staggering and those towns,

1940
01:49:22.081 --> 01:49:26.250
they fought for Fallujah in Iraq,
Helmand province in Afghanistan,

1941
01:49:26.490 --> 01:49:29.610
and now back in the hands of the Taliban in Helmand province.

1942
01:49:30.120 --> 01:49:31.710
That's not even news here.
No.

1943
01:49:31.770 --> 01:49:35.040
All those places margin that the place I described earlier is now back in the

1944
01:49:35.041 --> 01:49:36.870
hands of the Taliban.
I've been,
um,
you know,

1945
01:49:36.871 --> 01:49:38.160
since I went there with the US marines,

1946
01:49:38.820 --> 01:49:42.510
I don't remember seeing a headline about them.
No,
no.

1947
01:49:42.511 --> 01:49:46.520
It's conveniently ignored because the public are just,
you know,
you know,

1948
01:49:46.680 --> 01:49:47.471
I've had long,

1949
01:49:47.471 --> 01:49:50.380
I've seen people come back in body bags or without leg and thinking,

1950
01:49:50.381 --> 01:49:51.940
I don't even know what victory looks like now.

1951
01:49:52.180 --> 01:49:54.370
I don't even know what the point of this is,
is anymore.
Yeah.

1952
01:49:54.371 --> 01:49:59.050
Where are we 16 years in?
Is that what it is now?
Afghanistan is 1818 yeah.

1953
01:50:00.190 --> 01:50:01.990
I mean,
they say the longest war in American history,

1954
01:50:02.560 --> 01:50:03.910
the first four or five years,

1955
01:50:04.390 --> 01:50:07.660
we went to Iraq very quickly and weren't doing very much in Afghanistan.
So,

1956
01:50:07.720 --> 01:50:10.910
you know,
I'd argue it's not an 1819 year war,
but it's,

1957
01:50:10.911 --> 01:50:12.550
it's a very long and very costly war.

1958
01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:16.320
Does this ever give you this feeling of hopelessness to like deal?

1959
01:50:16.440 --> 01:50:19.360
Do you look at yourself 40 years down the line still doing this?
Like how do,

1960
01:50:19.420 --> 01:50:21.790
how do you,
how do you approach this?

1961
01:50:22.150 --> 01:50:26.110
I think about that and I also think about just selling everything I have and

1962
01:50:26.111 --> 01:50:28.090
getting a little house in Jamaica and just

1963
01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:34.780
kind of think I tried to do my bit,
I'm not sure how much of a bit I did,
but,

1964
01:50:34.810 --> 01:50:39.670
but yeah,
like it's,
yeah,
it's,
it's a,
you can get that feeling very easily.
Yeah,

1965
01:50:39.671 --> 01:50:41.180
I would imagine that you,

1966
01:50:41.420 --> 01:50:46.120
you see so much and you see so much anguish in so much pain and suffering and

1967
01:50:46.121 --> 01:50:50.440
death and war and so much of it seems pointless that after a while you might

1968
01:50:50.441 --> 01:50:54.790
want to just detach,
disconnect.
And you said it earlier,
you know,

1969
01:50:54.791 --> 01:50:57.880
when you read the numbers here,
the stories,
I just,

1970
01:50:58.030 --> 01:51:01.390
I can't even take it seriously anymore.
I mean,
I can take it seriously,

1971
01:51:01.391 --> 01:51:02.620
but I can't fathom it,
you know?

1972
01:51:02.640 --> 01:51:06.070
I can't really take it onboard and really imagine what that's like.
Yeah.

1973
01:51:06.220 --> 01:51:08.410
And I've seen it with my own eyes.
And even then it's,
it's,

1974
01:51:08.411 --> 01:51:13.180
it's so hard to process.
Do you have an exit strategy?
No.
Um,

1975
01:51:14.980 --> 01:51:18.700
I mean I could make documentaries about other things,
um,

1976
01:51:18.940 --> 01:51:22.860
but I just don't think it would be this,
this,
this feels urgent to me.
Yeah.

1977
01:51:22.990 --> 01:51:26.860
You know?
Um,
and I question how useful this work is,

1978
01:51:26.861 --> 01:51:28.330
but it feels somewhat useful.

1979
01:51:28.331 --> 01:51:32.110
It certainly feels like the most useful thing I can do for now.
I'm not a doctor.

1980
01:51:32.111 --> 01:51:37.060
I'm not,
you know,
I'm not a politician.
So even if it's not that much use,

1981
01:51:37.061 --> 01:51:38.920
it's somewhat useful.
Well,

1982
01:51:38.921 --> 01:51:42.070
there's also the problem that you've,

1983
01:51:42.340 --> 01:51:46.030
you've dedicated so much of your time too.
I do think it's very useful.

1984
01:51:46.540 --> 01:51:51.540
You've dedicated so much time doing this that if you were to make a documentary

1985
01:51:52.001 --> 01:51:55.730
on something frivolous,
so this guy is a cabinet maker.
How do you do it,
Bob?
Yeah,

1986
01:51:55.731 --> 01:51:59.540
yeah,
yeah.
You might lose your fucking mind.
I mean,

1987
01:51:59.590 --> 01:52:03.430
I don't think once you've experienced what you've experienced,

1988
01:52:03.431 --> 01:52:04.660
it's probably very,

1989
01:52:04.661 --> 01:52:09.661
very difficult to look at the I the world through a normal lens and be satisfied

1990
01:52:10.301 --> 01:52:11.410
with normal results.

1991
01:52:11.800 --> 01:52:15.710
And it would be easy to dismiss anything else you did as being frivolous in

1992
01:52:15.820 --> 01:52:19.090
comparison to covering Yemen or Afghanistan or Congo or wherever.

1993
01:52:19.600 --> 01:52:24.520
So do you essentially just take it project by project and just keep going?
Yeah,

1994
01:52:24.521 --> 01:52:24.931
I mean,
I'm,

1995
01:52:24.931 --> 01:52:27.300
I'm thinking about this everyday right now because like I said in the,

1996
01:52:27.360 --> 01:52:30.790
in that first Mtma I thought this is what you want to do.
This is,

1997
01:52:30.791 --> 01:52:34.660
this is what you care about,
this is where your eyes.
Um,
so I'm,
I'm,

1998
01:52:34.661 --> 01:52:36.490
I'm pretty sure I want to,
I want to keep on doing it,

1999
01:52:36.491 --> 01:52:37.930
just maybe doing it in a different way.

2000
01:52:38.140 --> 01:52:42.970
I'm also really tempted just to try and take three months off and go to Costa

2001
01:52:42.970 --> 01:52:47.870
Rico and surf and do yoga and read books and just,
just,
just then see how I feel.

2002
01:52:47.871 --> 01:52:51.800
One of my favorite quotes is,
um,
is Nietzsche says a credit,
no thought,

2003
01:52:51.830 --> 01:52:56.340
not had in the open air while walking in,
in beautiful landscapes.
Uh,

2004
01:52:56.341 --> 01:52:58.700
what a great question.
Yeah.
Only when you're in that state of mind,

2005
01:52:58.701 --> 01:52:59.810
can you make the right decision?

2006
01:52:59.811 --> 01:53:04.040
So it'd be nice to make the decision in a place like that.
Sure.
It's mostly,

2007
01:53:04.041 --> 01:53:08.160
you mean you caught up in the momentum of these chaotic events and everyday

2008
01:53:08.161 --> 01:53:09.770
something new is happening that you want to be in.
I mean,

2009
01:53:09.771 --> 01:53:13.700
Isis are about to get defeated in Syria.
I want to be there to see it.
Yeah.

2010
01:53:13.880 --> 01:53:18.050
Cover it.
Do you think you really could take three months and go to Costa Rico?

2011
01:53:18.110 --> 01:53:19.340
Have you done that before?

2012
01:53:19.610 --> 01:53:22.950
I did nine days in Jamaica recently and nine whole days.
Yeah.

2013
01:53:23.120 --> 01:53:24.290
What was it like on Day two?

2014
01:53:25.380 --> 01:53:30.320
I loved every minute of it and I actually felt like my brain kind of woke up.

2015
01:53:30.470 --> 01:53:34.340
Yeah.
I just felt
the numbness I talked about earlier.

2016
01:53:34.341 --> 01:53:38.780
The worst thing is it just kills your curiosity.
Yeah.
And that's,
that's horrible.

2017
01:53:39.010 --> 01:53:42.290
Um,
and it just,
I just felt,
you know,
curious again,

2018
01:53:42.291 --> 01:53:46.080
I felt like my mind and I read a couple of books that weren't war related and I,

2019
01:53:46.460 --> 01:53:48.710
I focused on them.
I took it here and I,
you know,
I was,

2020
01:53:48.711 --> 01:53:51.170
I was in it for the experience and I loved it.

2021
01:53:52.820 --> 01:53:55.490
Why don't you just do that then take those three months

2022
01:53:57.150 --> 01:54:01.760
in different view.
You know,
I feel guilty.
You have do feel guilty.
Yeah.

2023
01:54:01.820 --> 01:54:03.160
Yeah.
That's what I was going to ask you.

2024
01:54:03.640 --> 01:54:06.860
I wanted to know if you felt guilty around day two.
I did.
I didn't,

2025
01:54:06.861 --> 01:54:09.940
I didn't feel guilty on this one cause it was,
it was quick.
Um,

2026
01:54:10.670 --> 01:54:12.110
I mean in the past,
you know,
you can,

2027
01:54:12.140 --> 01:54:15.140
you can go to a big fight and enjoy it and love it and you can go for a big

2028
01:54:15.141 --> 01:54:19.950
dinner and enjoy it and love it.
But that's about it.
Um,
you know,
a month of,

2029
01:54:19.951 --> 01:54:23.490
of luxury somewhere I think I would,
I would get uncomfortable.

2030
01:54:23.491 --> 01:54:26.410
You're not covering this fight when you went to the Earl sprints.
You know,

2031
01:54:26.460 --> 01:54:28.280
I've just,
I've made a couple of boxing docs.

2032
01:54:28.330 --> 01:54:29.780
I made a documentary about Danny Jacobs.

2033
01:54:29.900 --> 01:54:33.050
Did you realize when he survived cancer and the night he became a world
champion?

2034
01:54:33.200 --> 01:54:34.790
Oh,
why we were there.
And it was actually,

2035
01:54:34.791 --> 01:54:37.880
it was great to be able to say to people,
here's my latest film.

2036
01:54:37.940 --> 01:54:42.020
It'll make you feel really good.
So it to contradict what I said earlier,

2037
01:54:42.021 --> 01:54:43.700
that felt really good to be able to do that.

2038
01:54:44.390 --> 01:54:48.610
Maybe there's more of those in your future.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um,

2039
01:54:48.650 --> 01:54:52.100
I was talking to someone the other day about maybe a documentary about the gym

2040
01:54:52.101 --> 01:54:52.970
that Danny comes from,

2041
01:54:53.390 --> 01:54:57.730
which is a door that leads to the basement of a Bodega in bedstuy and they don't

2042
01:54:57.731 --> 01:55:00.080
have three world champions.
Wow.
Assigning,

2043
01:55:00.420 --> 01:55:04.430
it's not a lot bigger than this room really.
It was a lower ceiling.
Yeah,
yeah,

2044
01:55:04.820 --> 01:55:08.750
yeah,
yeah.
And it's underneath the Bodega.
Yeah.
It's a Sadam Ali,

2045
01:55:08.751 --> 01:55:13.670
you're think is the first Arab or Yemeni world champion.
He beat Miguel Kata.
Wow.

2046
01:55:13.700 --> 01:55:16.490
You got into boxing.
He's a kid.
So his daddy owns the Bodega,

2047
01:55:16.520 --> 01:55:19.160
built this gym in the basement and that's where he and Danny came up.

2048
01:55:19.460 --> 01:55:22.070
That's incredible.
And people walk past it.
And it's just this door.

2049
01:55:22.100 --> 01:55:23.840
There's no sign.
And then people don't even know.

2050
01:55:24.140 --> 01:55:26.630
Have you ever been to the Cronk team in Detroit?
No,
I haven't.

2051
01:55:26.690 --> 01:55:28.430
It's doesn't exist anymore,
does it?
No.
No.

2052
01:55:28.470 --> 01:55:30.770
But you turn up to the building and you think this can't be the right place.

2053
01:55:30.771 --> 01:55:34.490
It's like a derelict building and you go down in this basement staircase into

2054
01:55:34.491 --> 01:55:38.450
the basement and there's this crappy gym and with one ring and a few bags and

2055
01:55:38.451 --> 01:55:40.370
that's it.
And then Tommy hands walks in and Henry,

2056
01:55:40.371 --> 01:55:44.020
I can one day walks in and you know,
Uber car walks in.
It's similar to that.
I had

2057
01:55:44.030 --> 01:55:48.270
<v 2>Lennox Lewis on the podcast.
It was amazing.
He's amazing.</v>

2058
01:55:48.850 --> 01:55:50.850
Yeah.
It seems like there's anything wrong with them at all.

2059
01:55:51.420 --> 01:55:54.560
I was wondering if chasses what's helping him,
you know,

2060
01:55:54.570 --> 01:55:58.950
because he doesn't seem to be sustaining any of the longterm and he got knocked

2061
01:55:58.951 --> 01:56:02.930
out a couple of times like that.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

2062
01:56:03.270 --> 01:56:08.250
He really did.
You know?
I mean it's,
it's,
it's amazing.

2063
01:56:08.960 --> 01:56:12.300
I want,
I really do wonder,
because chess is so,

2064
01:56:13.080 --> 01:56:16.680
it's so difficult and your,
your mind is constantly firing.

2065
01:56:16.681 --> 01:56:21.681
And it and the brain in some ways does atrophy without use.

2066
01:56:22.650 --> 01:56:25.770
I mean,
whether it's not physical atrophy in terms of the size of it,

2067
01:56:25.771 --> 01:56:29.940
but it in terms of its abilities,
the more active you are solving.

2068
01:56:29.941 --> 01:56:33.360
Po George Foreman used to do a lot of crossword puzzles and things along those

2069
01:56:33.361 --> 01:56:38.361
lines and he actively sought different difficult little quizzes and puzzles and

2070
01:56:38.851 --> 01:56:42.930
things.
So he keep his mind sharp.
I met Quincy Jones a couple of months ago.

2071
01:56:42.990 --> 01:56:47.340
Oh yeah,
he's learning Mandarin,
I think.
How old is he?

2072
01:56:48.210 --> 01:56:51.930
I don't know.
He's in his eighties I think he just wanted to,
wow.
And by the way,

2073
01:56:51.931 --> 01:56:55.080
we had,
we had whole group of us had dinner and he was the last man to leave.

2074
01:56:55.170 --> 01:56:57.870
He closed the restaurant down.
Wow.
He's incredible.

2075
01:56:58.270 --> 01:57:02.280
I got into an argument about Rio and racism in Brazil,
in front of him really?

2076
01:57:02.460 --> 01:57:04.200
And he said that,
wait a minute,

2077
01:57:04.650 --> 01:57:07.730
I've been going to the favelas in Rio since the 60s I thought,
oh shit.

2078
01:57:07.740 --> 01:57:11.770
Here we go.
And he said,
and Ben's right,
Priscilla is deeply racist stuff.

2079
01:57:12.270 --> 01:57:15.690
I just got backed up by it by Quincy Jones.
Did an argument.
It was,
it was great,

2080
01:57:15.691 --> 01:57:19.200
but he's,
he says exactly the same thing.
Yeah.

2081
01:57:19.201 --> 01:57:23.610
So he does these things specifically to try to stay sharp.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

2082
01:57:23.611 --> 01:57:27.000
Treat the brain like a muscle.
Yeah.
I think there's something to that.
I mean,

2083
01:57:27.001 --> 01:57:31.290
the [inaudible],
I mean,
Lennox Lewis is obviously one anecdotal case,
but man,

2084
01:57:31.410 --> 01:57:33.030
he's so fucking sharp.

2085
01:57:33.060 --> 01:57:36.870
But that's what's so frightening about the numbness that comes from the PTSD is

2086
01:57:36.871 --> 01:57:39.000
if it takes away that curiosity,
it takes it out.

2087
01:57:39.020 --> 01:57:41.010
You've got a day off and you think,
I'm going to do a crossword.

2088
01:57:41.011 --> 01:57:44.400
I want to learn a language.
And it takes away that,
that energy that's,

2089
01:57:44.490 --> 01:57:49.380
that's terrifying,
right?
The numbness.
Yeah.
The,
the numbness that people,

2090
01:57:49.560 --> 01:57:52.510
well,
people in extreme poverty and extreme stress,
they,

2091
01:57:52.580 --> 01:57:55.110
they do experience that sort of numbness,

2092
01:57:55.111 --> 01:57:58.950
especially if you're in a dangerous neighborhood and just,
you're overwhelmed,

2093
01:57:58.951 --> 01:58:02.670
like you were saying about how the adrenaline eventually wears off and then,

2094
01:58:02.671 --> 01:58:06.780
you know,
just kind of,
you're in this weird gray state.
Yup.

2095
01:58:07.310 --> 01:58:12.120
And imagine someone,
someone in prison,
if you can awaken that,
you know,
um,

2096
01:58:12.600 --> 01:58:13.500
who knows what's possible.

2097
01:58:13.530 --> 01:58:15.810
But it seems like there's almost no effort at rehabilitation,

2098
01:58:15.811 --> 01:58:18.720
but awakening that is,
I don't think that difficult.

2099
01:58:18.780 --> 01:58:21.300
It just needs the right book or the right person,
the right film.
Well,

2100
01:58:21.301 --> 01:58:26.301
there's a place where I believe Mtma therapy could really have some amazing

2101
01:58:26.791 --> 01:58:28.740
results.
Yeah.
We've talked about it with,

2102
01:58:28.741 --> 01:58:30.300
with the therapist who were leading this.

2103
01:58:30.550 --> 01:58:33.630
I think that's their dream is to get in and do this in a prison because I

2104
01:58:33.631 --> 01:58:38.550
guarantee the majority of those guys in there as suffering from PTSD reaction or

2105
01:58:38.551 --> 01:58:42.220
reacting to it well,
and the majority of them probably been abused

2106
01:58:42.670 --> 01:58:46.720
<v 3>and come from abusive environments and horrible situations,</v>

2107
01:58:46.721 --> 01:58:51.490
and the,
the idea that we just hate people and lock them in cages and say,
well,

2108
01:58:51.491 --> 01:58:53.560
you've done your time now,
get get out,

2109
01:58:53.561 --> 01:58:57.430
and now you're going to be even more fucked up,
and now you're,
you know,

2110
01:58:57.460 --> 01:59:01.300
you're habituated.
Yeah.
You're used to being surrounded by violent criminals,

2111
01:59:01.750 --> 01:59:02.650
good luck in the world,

2112
01:59:02.651 --> 01:59:06.250
and we're going to make it even harder for you than anybody else to get a job or

2113
01:59:06.251 --> 01:59:08.110
an apartment.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean,

2114
01:59:08.111 --> 01:59:11.470
there was this story about Kim Kardashian and trying to pay this guy's rent

2115
01:59:11.500 --> 01:59:15.160
cause you've got out of jail and she's going to pay his rent for five years to

2116
01:59:15.161 --> 01:59:19.720
sort of get him on his feet.
He still can't get a fucking apartment.
Oh,

2117
01:59:19.721 --> 01:59:23.140
it had the first patent.
Nobody wants him.

2118
01:59:23.740 --> 01:59:26.430
No one wants to take him in.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's,

2119
01:59:27.070 --> 01:59:30.190
and we don't ever want to give anybody a road to redemption.
You fuck up.

2120
01:59:30.191 --> 01:59:34.870
Once you do something wrong,
one robbery,
you get accused of fucking up.
Oh yeah.

2121
01:59:34.930 --> 01:59:37.630
And you'll have to write this for three years before we even stand trial.
Sure.

2122
01:59:37.720 --> 01:59:41.560
I read a stat the other day,
I think it's 94% of trials in the u s,
uh,

2123
01:59:41.590 --> 01:59:45.160
settled on a,
on a plea bargain.
Don't even go to trial.

2124
01:59:45.790 --> 01:59:47.740
And I thought that was wrong.
I thought that can't be accurate.

2125
01:59:48.070 --> 01:59:50.680
And while they scare people,
yeah.
Yeah.
You can plead,

2126
01:59:50.740 --> 01:59:52.420
plead guilty and get five years.
Yeah.

2127
01:59:52.450 --> 01:59:56.500
Well you can go to Charlotte and you'll probably get 30.
Yeah.
Which is insane.

2128
01:59:57.190 --> 01:59:57.701
Like,
what,

2129
01:59:57.701 --> 02:00:01.570
why would you give me five years if a judge would give me 30 like what is that?

2130
02:00:02.080 --> 02:00:05.650
What has happened in there if I am guilty?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
No,
it's insane.

2131
02:00:05.651 --> 02:00:06.484
It's just like the,

2132
02:00:07.010 --> 02:00:10.850
the money saving sort of mechanism and,

2133
02:00:10.880 --> 02:00:15.580
and in ensuring that they don't lose,
you know,
and just they scare you.

2134
02:00:16.170 --> 02:00:20.530
Yeah.
You want to risk it all.
You want to 30 years you won't have a life,

2135
02:00:20.560 --> 02:00:24.730
but five years you will.
Yeah.
You might get out in to,
yeah,
be a good fella.

2136
02:00:25.510 --> 02:00:28.870
Don't stab anybody in jail.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2137
02:00:29.830 --> 02:00:34.340
What we do with people in this country when someone commits a crime is it's

2138
02:00:34.390 --> 02:00:35.050
pretty stunning.

2139
02:00:35.050 --> 02:00:39.430
And then when you factor in the fact that there's actual businesses that evolve

2140
02:00:39.431 --> 02:00:43.390
or revolve rather around profiting off of people being incarcerated is even

2141
02:00:43.450 --> 02:00:47.520
crazier.
Yep.
And no one investigates that either.
Yeah.
I mean,
again,

2142
02:00:47.530 --> 02:00:49.510
there are some great investigations,
Propublica,

2143
02:00:49.540 --> 02:00:52.030
people like that or how many people are reading them,
reading them.

2144
02:00:52.060 --> 02:00:55.100
That's a better way to say it.
Yeah.
It's not,
the new information is there.

2145
02:00:55.630 --> 02:00:58.960
And to your point about,
you know,
the,
the overflow of information,
it's all there.

2146
02:00:58.961 --> 02:00:59.710
It's just,

2147
02:00:59.710 --> 02:01:02.140
that's not the stuff at the top of the pile and nowhere near the top of the
pile.

2148
02:01:02.180 --> 02:01:04.030
That's probably the last thing that people concentrating on.

2149
02:01:04.031 --> 02:01:07.300
Cause you're assuming these people are bad criminals and you don't want them on

2150
02:01:07.301 --> 02:01:09.180
the street.
What do you want to do?
You want to feel,

2151
02:01:09.190 --> 02:01:11.680
think about all the good people out there that are struggling.

2152
02:01:11.710 --> 02:01:16.300
Concentrate of them first then what?
But this is part of what's wrong.

2153
02:01:16.390 --> 02:01:19.330
Part of what's wrong is these people were in these terrible situations,

2154
02:01:19.570 --> 02:01:23.500
terrible communities,
no way out,
nothing,
no positive image to model.

2155
02:01:23.860 --> 02:01:27.430
Everyone is a drug dealer or criminal.
It's crime around you all the time.

2156
02:01:27.431 --> 02:01:31.930
You wind up in the system,
he become incarcerated.
And then that's your life now.

2157
02:01:31.990 --> 02:01:32.340
Yeah.

2158
02:01:32.340 --> 02:01:36.310
And you're stuck in this thing and there's more of them in American prison than

2159
02:01:36.311 --> 02:01:38.630
anywhere else on the planet earth.
And as a foreigner here,

2160
02:01:38.650 --> 02:01:40.010
that's one of the things that just never

2161
02:01:40.130 --> 02:01:44.300
<v 2>fails to shock me.
Well,
he,
England's got its own concerns too,
right?
I mean,</v>

2162
02:01:44.301 --> 02:01:48.830
there's so many fucking stabbings in London now.
It's really crazy.
Yeah.
Uh,
yeah.

2163
02:01:48.860 --> 02:01:53.220
I mean,
but compared to shootings here,
this is nothing,
you know,
it's,
yeah.

2164
02:01:53.600 --> 02:01:55.610
But yeah,
it's,
it's,
it's definitely a problem.
And then you know,

2165
02:01:55.611 --> 02:01:58.880
that you just don't see police on the streets like he used to,
um,

2166
02:01:58.940 --> 02:02:03.470
in London and you don't see police.
My Dad was a policeman,
um,
before I was born.

2167
02:02:03.560 --> 02:02:05.030
But you,
you just don't see,
you know,

2168
02:02:05.230 --> 02:02:07.820
like streetwise policemen who were part of the local community,

2169
02:02:07.821 --> 02:02:11.570
getting intelligence,
knowing what's going on.
Um,
and often you'll see,
I mean,

2170
02:02:11.571 --> 02:02:12.770
I remember the riots in Brixton,

2171
02:02:12.771 --> 02:02:15.620
which we're right near where I lived and the police would stand back,

2172
02:02:15.630 --> 02:02:18.320
let the riot unfold and then just study video afterwards.

2173
02:02:18.610 --> 02:02:21.500
I recognize that guy will arrest him three days later.
Oh,
Jesus.

2174
02:02:21.650 --> 02:02:22.420
I didn't think that's what,

2175
02:02:22.420 --> 02:02:25.700
at least we're supposed to do while they want to protect their own house.
Yeah,

2176
02:02:25.880 --> 02:02:29.090
yeah,
yeah.
Ben,
how do we fix the world?

2177
02:02:30.530 --> 02:02:34.880
I have no idea.
I think it might be MGMA.
Actually,
I,
I know some people would,

2178
02:02:34.940 --> 02:02:38.180
would say that and make a good argument for it and uh,
and,
and really believe it,

2179
02:02:38.181 --> 02:02:41.090
it's just a really good argument for psychedelics remapping the world.

2180
02:02:41.360 --> 02:02:45.980
The really,
there's frivolous.
Yeah.
There's a moment in the Mtma documentary did,

2181
02:02:45.981 --> 02:02:49.690
were interview Rick Doblin,
you know,
the,
the,
the mastermind of this.
Um,

2182
02:02:49.760 --> 02:02:53.210
I found him on,
oh wait,
yeah,
he's been on.
And at the end I say,

2183
02:02:53.211 --> 02:02:56.360
what's the potential of this if you get it legalized?
And he,
he basically says,

2184
02:02:56.390 --> 02:03:00.680
spiritual eyes,
the world world peace.
And I look at him like,
are you serious?

2185
02:03:00.740 --> 02:03:02.300
And he laughed and says,
I know it sounds crazy,

2186
02:03:02.301 --> 02:03:07.130
but I really believe this is possible.
It is possible.
What will not just Mgma,

2187
02:03:07.131 --> 02:03:11.750
MGMA is a great doorway because of its work with people with trauma,

2188
02:03:12.050 --> 02:03:15.470
but psilocybin as as well and you know,
suicide,

2189
02:03:15.471 --> 02:03:20.090
but obviously comes with these profound breakthrough psychedelic experiences

2190
02:03:20.091 --> 02:03:23.990
that complete,
not just completely remap your perceptions of life,

2191
02:03:23.991 --> 02:03:26.890
but show you a whole world that you didn't think could possibly exist.

2192
02:03:27.470 --> 02:03:28.860
And then all the other ones,
you know,

2193
02:03:28.940 --> 02:03:32.570
Ibogaine for all these people that are hooked on pills and it was one of the

2194
02:03:32.571 --> 02:03:37.571
most effective drugs or known molecules on earth and alleviating people.

2195
02:03:38.650 --> 02:03:41.300
Opiates.
I'm trying to ketamine now.
I've tried it a couple of times,

2196
02:03:41.301 --> 02:03:43.670
but that's what they want to try with me next.
Yeah.

2197
02:03:43.730 --> 02:03:47.330
I mean anything that makes people compassionate and kind to themselves as well

2198
02:03:47.331 --> 02:03:50.330
as to others.
Yes.
And it doesn't seem like that much of a jump.

2199
02:03:50.331 --> 02:03:52.820
I think most people have it in them.
Yeah.
You know,
not,

2200
02:03:52.821 --> 02:03:54.980
not that far under the surface.
People are scared,

2201
02:03:55.350 --> 02:03:57.730
they're scared and they're tense.
And you know,

2202
02:03:57.770 --> 02:04:00.230
people were just in constant states of conflict.
I mean,

2203
02:04:00.231 --> 02:04:02.180
that's a big thing that's going on in this world.

2204
02:04:02.540 --> 02:04:07.540
And one of the things that psychedelics do is they give you a brief break from

2205
02:04:08.781 --> 02:04:13.781
that conflict and then give you these thoughts that he probably would have never

2206
02:04:15.741 --> 02:04:19.340
achieved without these drugs.
And that's exactly what [inaudible] did with me.

2207
02:04:19.341 --> 02:04:23.150
It just removed all of those.
Are those fears?
Yeah.
Um,
yeah,

2208
02:04:23.840 --> 02:04:26.240
I think it's entirely possible.
I really do.

2209
02:04:26.540 --> 02:04:29.340
I think it's a real,
there's a,

2210
02:04:29.570 --> 02:04:34.570
there's a real case for us being able to set up some sort of clinics,

2211
02:04:36.560 --> 02:04:38.100
some sort of supervise

2212
02:04:38.100 --> 02:04:43.100
<v 3>psychedelic experiences where one after another people start changing and they,</v>

2213
02:04:43.510 --> 02:04:47.820
that trickles down.
They start changing the people around them.
People say,
well,

2214
02:04:47.821 --> 02:04:49.110
what happened to Mike?
Like,
Oh,

2215
02:04:49.111 --> 02:04:53.220
Mike did Mushrooms at this new clinic that they're opening up and the chain,

2216
02:04:53.230 --> 02:04:55.710
he's a new guy,
he's a different person.
He's so nice.

2217
02:04:56.100 --> 02:04:58.440
And then they joined two and I mean,

2218
02:04:58.441 --> 02:05:00.810
I just think there's so much room for that in this world.

2219
02:05:01.110 --> 02:05:05.220
It's so difficult to change who you are.
People rarely change.

2220
02:05:05.520 --> 02:05:09.960
They become a slightly different version of who they were five 10 15 years ago,

2221
02:05:10.020 --> 02:05:12.060
but they rarely actually change.

2222
02:05:12.220 --> 02:05:14.670
And then even to people who are completely skeptical about this,

2223
02:05:14.671 --> 02:05:18.210
the fact this is helping veterans,
everyone is behind it.
Well,

2224
02:05:18.211 --> 02:05:20.670
it's a great way to get in.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean,

2225
02:05:20.671 --> 02:05:25.620
they're very wise maps is in their approach to this one particular modality

2226
02:05:25.621 --> 02:05:28.260
because if they can actually achieve this,

2227
02:05:28.950 --> 02:05:32.460
you're going to also achieve it and help people that are in the,

2228
02:05:33.030 --> 02:05:37.620
they're in the community that's least likely to accept psychedelics,

2229
02:05:37.621 --> 02:05:41.040
right wing,
pro war,
you know,

2230
02:05:41.090 --> 02:05:43.680
mag a people like those,
those people.

2231
02:05:43.740 --> 02:05:47.910
I mean those are probably the least likely.
If you wanted to generalize,

2232
02:05:48.270 --> 02:05:51.450
to accept psychedelics.
Wait,
we watched the Fox News segment with Rick,

2233
02:05:51.520 --> 02:05:55.110
his house in Boston or Fox News,
talking about Mtma for veterans.

2234
02:05:55.280 --> 02:05:57.780
How did they approach it?
They looked at each other at the end and said,

2235
02:05:57.900 --> 02:06:00.750
do you ever think you'd do a pro ecstasy piece?
And they said,
no,

2236
02:06:00.751 --> 02:06:05.130
but if it helps the veterans,
I guess we're for it too,
right?
Yes,
exactly.

2237
02:06:05.131 --> 02:06:07.610
Yeah,
exactly.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And if,

2238
02:06:07.650 --> 02:06:11.760
if it can lower crime rates to get people on mushrooms,
I mean,

2239
02:06:11.790 --> 02:06:16.350
if a dime methyl tryptamine can change people's perceptions,

2240
02:06:16.740 --> 02:06:20.820
there's so many of these different trucks too that you could introduce people to

2241
02:06:20.821 --> 02:06:25.800
under a clinical supervision setting where you could change that.
I mean,

2242
02:06:25.801 --> 02:06:29.040
how many people are involved in psychotherapy and it doesn't do a goddamn thing

2243
02:06:29.041 --> 02:06:33.000
to them.
They just keep going back and forth or they numb them up with pills.
Oh,

2244
02:06:33.001 --> 02:06:37.050
with me,
it was so off straight away.
They doubled the dose,
didn't work,

2245
02:06:37.051 --> 02:06:39.750
double the dose again.
I was just,
I was just a Zombie.
Yeah.

2246
02:06:39.751 --> 02:06:42.210
And that I don't have any experience with it,

2247
02:06:42.211 --> 02:06:47.130
but I know people that have had very negative experiences with the world becomes

2248
02:06:47.490 --> 02:06:51.480
all the bright colors are gone and the world just becomes a weird,

2249
02:06:51.810 --> 02:06:54.390
that's exact dollars.
Yeah.
Dealt,
dealt everything.
Yeah.

2250
02:06:54.391 --> 02:06:58.080
And the great thing about MDA is it's not a potential opioid crisis because it's

2251
02:06:58.081 --> 02:07:00.030
a therapist sitting down giving you the pill.

2252
02:07:00.480 --> 02:07:03.870
I don't give you 50 pills and you can abuse it however you want.
Yeah.
I was done.

2253
02:07:03.871 --> 02:07:04.350
I mean,

2254
02:07:04.350 --> 02:07:07.190
logistically doing what you say is going to be hard to set up and we didn't need

2255
02:07:07.191 --> 02:07:11.670
a lot of therapists,
a lot of facilities.
But it's,
it's,
it's,
it's,
it's possible.

2256
02:07:11.730 --> 02:07:16.680
Well,
once their success it,
and then it becomes a business,
then it can happen.

2257
02:07:16.890 --> 02:07:19.230
I mean,
once insurance starts covering it,

2258
02:07:19.530 --> 02:07:23.460
once people start experiencing positive benefits,
you can get it from both sides,

2259
02:07:23.461 --> 02:07:27.660
right.
You get it from the commerce aspect,
you get money starts coming in,

2260
02:07:27.900 --> 02:07:31.950
people start paying for it,
and it becomes a business that's successful.

2261
02:07:32.280 --> 02:07:35.100
It actually has good results.
People start talking,
well,

2262
02:07:35.440 --> 02:07:38.770
it or the people start opening up these,
these centers.
Yeah.
It,

2263
02:07:39.010 --> 02:07:42.430
there's so much potential to this and those people at maps and Rick Doblin and

2264
02:07:42.431 --> 02:07:43.990
all of his crew there,
they're really,

2265
02:07:44.320 --> 02:07:47.530
they have the real potential to change the world.

2266
02:07:47.580 --> 02:07:48.413
<v 0>Yep.</v>

2267
02:07:48.570 --> 02:07:51.540
And actually went the first session when I was really resisting it and fighting

2268
02:07:51.541 --> 02:07:56.490
it,
I just imagined Rick's face and the Met office faces in,
in,
uh,
South Carolina.

2269
02:07:56.970 --> 02:07:59.930
Um,
and just the kindness and benevolence.
Yeah.

2270
02:07:59.931 --> 02:08:04.050
And I just thought of those faces and that's what allowed me to just let it wash

2271
02:08:04.051 --> 02:08:07.170
over and wow.
And,
and hit me.
Um,

2272
02:08:07.200 --> 02:08:10.180
but Johnson and Johnson just got permission to use to,

2273
02:08:10.260 --> 02:08:14.960
to market their version of ketamine.
And right now,
uh,

2274
02:08:15.020 --> 02:08:18.720
the,
the dose of Ketamine I had was,
is like $90 a,

2275
02:08:18.780 --> 02:08:22.460
they're going to sell it for $15,000.
That's,

2276
02:08:22.461 --> 02:08:25.230
that's the danger of it getting properly legalized.
And as you said,

2277
02:08:25.231 --> 02:08:27.840
turned into a successful business.
Oh,
that's terrible.
Yeah.

2278
02:08:28.410 --> 02:08:31.050
<v 3>Now why is it so expensive?
Just so they can make money off of it.</v>

2279
02:08:31.100 --> 02:08:34.170
Now this is the therapeutic Joe dose of ketamine in a,

2280
02:08:34.260 --> 02:08:38.030
some sort of a psychiatric sort of survey.

2281
02:08:38.470 --> 02:08:40.200
What's the environment they're going to do it.
And

2282
02:08:40.800 --> 02:08:43.350
<v 0>so they want to have it very much controlled,</v>

2283
02:08:44.100 --> 02:08:46.920
but it looks like they want to stop there.

2284
02:08:46.921 --> 02:08:51.450
The therapist's giving it in the study,
um,
in their own office.
I mean,
which is,

2285
02:08:51.451 --> 02:08:55.250
which is what's going on now and have it controlled and under,
um,
you know,

2286
02:08:55.650 --> 02:08:59.750
the universe,
hospitals sort of situation and there is a very good,
um,

2287
02:08:59.820 --> 02:09:01.430
and it's not even underground cause I'm not sure even shorter.

2288
02:09:01.431 --> 02:09:05.160
It is not illegal here.
Right.
Cadamine yeah.
I think it is illegal now,

2289
02:09:06.060 --> 02:09:09.680
but there are therapists giving it out now.
And I,
I bought legally,
you know,

2290
02:09:09.690 --> 02:09:13.050
I think you can,
oh,
you bought it with the prescription real?
Yeah.
Yeah.

2291
02:09:13.051 --> 02:09:17.880
With the prescription in New York.
Oh,
maybe I'm wrong.
Is Ketamine legal.

2292
02:09:19.090 --> 02:09:19.340
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2293
02:09:19.340 --> 02:09:21.350
<v 3>Legal under PR by prescription.</v>

2294
02:09:21.351 --> 02:09:24.170
Maybe it's a schedule two drug or something along those lines.

2295
02:09:24.390 --> 02:09:25.021
<v 0>I was going to get that.</v>

2296
02:09:25.021 --> 02:09:28.860
Someone sent me the message about the $15,000 and what that fucking crazy ones.

2297
02:09:28.890 --> 02:09:33.880
Yeah.
90 to 15,000.
Yeah.
Which is far worse.
Far More than the,

2298
02:09:33.950 --> 02:09:37.920
the,
you know,
the amount that Martin Shkreli,
um,
put up the price

2299
02:09:38.100 --> 02:09:42.480
<v 3>bright and went to jail for.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But uh,
yeah,
he's,
he's a Douche bag though.</v>

2300
02:09:42.570 --> 02:09:47.000
It's easy to point at him.
You know he owns that Wu Tang clan album.
Yeah.

2301
02:09:47.530 --> 02:09:52.500
I had him with that.
I don't know.
Someone's got it,
man.
He's in jail.
Jail.

2302
02:09:52.501 --> 02:09:53.460
Yay.
So I studies,

2303
02:09:53.580 --> 02:09:57.810
I saw he's still running his business from like a burner cell phone in jail.
Oh,

2304
02:09:57.811 --> 02:10:00.360
that's hilarious.
Well,
what he's saying is though,

2305
02:10:00.361 --> 02:10:02.310
what happened to the Wu Tang clan album?

2306
02:10:02.510 --> 02:10:03.343
<v 1>Uh,</v>

2307
02:10:04.280 --> 02:10:08.690
<v 3>I thought it was in possession of the FBI
or something.</v>

2308
02:10:08.691 --> 02:10:11.000
Come on son.
That shit is hilarious.

2309
02:10:11.030 --> 02:10:13.820
That might be one of the most hilarious parts of that story.

2310
02:10:13.821 --> 02:10:17.540
The FBI owns the Wu Tang clan.
Forbid now album.

2311
02:10:20.090 --> 02:10:24.260
How much did he pay?
He pay like $1 million for it because it was up for auction.

2312
02:10:24.740 --> 02:10:27.960
I think this says he paid 2 million.
Wow.

2313
02:10:29.720 --> 02:10:32.990
You can never get that money back.
Especially if the track's got released.

2314
02:10:35.150 --> 02:10:36.980
<v 2>But what a great marketing tool.</v>

2315
02:10:37.010 --> 02:10:39.290
It's worth more than $2 million in the marketing.

2316
02:10:40.340 --> 02:10:44.230
And I feel so not released.
He confirmed he paid 2,000,040.
Yeah,

2317
02:10:44.240 --> 02:10:49.130
but he's pulled shit.
Yeah,
I bet he did though.
I mean,
if I had a gas,

2318
02:10:49.730 --> 02:10:53.440
you know,
I mean how many wealthy people out there?
Wu Tang fans?
A lot.
Yeah.

2319
02:10:53.630 --> 02:10:57.880
Probably probably a healthy bid.
Healthy bidding war as of uh,

2320
02:10:58.580 --> 02:11:00.980
this is as if like a year ago,
the feds have it.

2321
02:11:01.160 --> 02:11:04.770
So I don't know if there's an update on that heel.
There's always,
I mean,

2322
02:11:05.090 --> 02:11:09.170
when it's an individual that's like him,
that's easy to,

2323
02:11:09.380 --> 02:11:13.580
it's easy to look at him disparagingly.
Like,
look at this guy,
he's a Dick,

2324
02:11:13.700 --> 02:11:14.181
you know?
Oh,

2325
02:11:14.181 --> 02:11:17.960
he wants to raise the money or raise the price of these drugs that can help

2326
02:11:17.961 --> 02:11:21.950
people.
Fuck him.
Let's go get them.
But if it's Johnson and Johnson,
it's like,

2327
02:11:22.160 --> 02:11:26.910
yeah,
first they make maybe powder.
Yeah.
You know,

2328
02:11:26.930 --> 02:11:28.010
they're so respected.

2329
02:11:28.340 --> 02:11:32.300
It's such a common household name.

2330
02:11:32.600 --> 02:11:36.060
And then I'm calling it ketamine.
They're calling it s ketamine,
s ketamine.

2331
02:11:36.120 --> 02:11:39.730
Slightly different.
That sounds like a snail,
right?

2332
02:11:39.770 --> 02:11:43.430
It sounds like guess cargo and it's a nasal spray.
Oh,
Jesus.

2333
02:11:43.431 --> 02:11:46.910
I don't know how different that makes it,
but,
well,

2334
02:11:46.911 --> 02:11:50.510
it's better than shooting it up because I know that a lot of people take it

2335
02:11:50.511 --> 02:11:54.920
intramuscularly where you just jab it into your thigh,
I believe.
Yeah.
This is,

2336
02:11:54.921 --> 02:11:58.970
the drug will only be given by accredited specialists who must monitor patients

2337
02:11:58.971 --> 02:12:00.740
for two hours after administration.

2338
02:12:00.770 --> 02:12:04.340
I don't think you can just get it and go home and,
oh,
that makes sense.
Because a,

2339
02:12:04.341 --> 02:12:08.800
I know Neal Brennan did it and he had some very good results from it.
I talked,

2340
02:12:08.820 --> 02:12:11.690
I've spoke to him a few times.
He's tried everything.
He's a,
he's trying to,

2341
02:12:11.720 --> 02:12:14.450
he's great.
He's had a,
he's fucking hilarious guy.

2342
02:12:14.840 --> 02:12:17.210
He's had some real depression problems though.

2343
02:12:17.280 --> 02:12:21.830
He has some very good relief from magnetic therapy.
Yeah.

2344
02:12:22.100 --> 02:12:25.420
And if you seen the involuntary trembling thing,
he did as well.
No.

2345
02:12:25.430 --> 02:12:27.920
What's the video of that was,
is that I have no idea.

2346
02:12:28.010 --> 02:12:30.010
And involuntary tremoring just sitting there and like,

2347
02:12:30.011 --> 02:12:32.000
cause I am and showed her was just going,
but he,
they just shut,

2348
02:12:32.001 --> 02:12:36.170
it was great to sum up with something.
Nothing job test.
Just talking.
Oh,

2349
02:12:36.171 --> 02:12:38.610
so he just does it on purpose.
Yeah.
Oh,

2350
02:12:38.630 --> 02:12:43.190
this therapist and then it gets him to do it somehow and that helps him.
Yeah.

2351
02:12:43.400 --> 02:12:45.590
I,
you'd have to ask him.
I don't know the ins and outs.

2352
02:12:46.030 --> 02:12:49.120
I watched the three Mike's special thinking.
It was just another comedy stand up.

2353
02:12:49.580 --> 02:12:53.030
I had no idea about that,
that the,
that Mike being the serious stuff.
Yeah.

2354
02:12:53.120 --> 02:12:55.070
I thought it was incredible.
He's a brilliant guy.

2355
02:12:55.160 --> 02:12:58.790
He's very smart guy and his standup is outstanding and it just keeps getting

2356
02:12:58.791 --> 02:13:02.300
better.
But you know,
he's a guy fighting demons.

2357
02:13:03.860 --> 02:13:04.220
Yeah.

2358
02:13:04.220 --> 02:13:09.150
He's the classic case of the comedian that can never be happy unless he's on

2359
02:13:09.151 --> 02:13:13.070
stage killing,
you know,
and then,
you know,
even then that's brief.

2360
02:13:13.160 --> 02:13:17.430
Like he's just never this jovial,
funny guy.
But he's a brilliant comedian.
Yeah.

2361
02:13:17.480 --> 02:13:20.450
But as long as I've known him for many years,
he struggled.

2362
02:13:20.630 --> 02:13:23.450
And it sounds like he's kind of an unofficial executive producer for a bunch of

2363
02:13:23.451 --> 02:13:25.370
other comedians as well.
Um,
how,
so?

2364
02:13:25.400 --> 02:13:28.310
Like advising them and giving them notes and it seems like a whole bunch of

2365
02:13:28.311 --> 02:13:28.631
people,

2366
02:13:28.631 --> 02:13:32.070
I'm sure you guys going and get his input and people definitely respect him.
But

2367
02:13:32.140 --> 02:13:32.310
yeah,

2368
02:13:32.310 --> 02:13:36.000
I'm sure he gives people taglines and gives them advice and stuff like that.

2369
02:13:36.030 --> 02:13:37.230
He's very smart guy,

2370
02:13:37.260 --> 02:13:41.340
but to be as honest as he was and not even end it with a joke.
Right.
You know,

2371
02:13:41.341 --> 02:13:44.760
just the tail,
the serious story.
And then,
yeah,
that blew me away.

2372
02:13:45.080 --> 02:13:48.870
I met him on the Friday night and watched it on the Saturday morning and had no

2373
02:13:48.871 --> 02:13:52.020
idea.
And it was,
it was one of the best things I've seen for a long time.
Wow.

2374
02:13:52.050 --> 02:13:56.520
Yeah.
No,
he's a special guy.
It's uh,
it's hard when,
you know,

2375
02:13:57.360 --> 02:14:02.360
I've had a few friends take their life three in the last year.

2376
02:14:03.300 --> 02:14:05.370
Um,
and you know,
you,

2377
02:14:06.300 --> 02:14:08.910
you see a guy like Neil and you know,

2378
02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:13.470
he's constantly pursuing all these different therapies and constantly trying to

2379
02:14:13.471 --> 02:14:18.471
find something that alleviates this depression and you just keep hoping you keep

2380
02:14:18.991 --> 02:14:19.710
opening,

2381
02:14:19.710 --> 02:14:23.390
keep searching and keep hoping that one of these things sticks he's thinks

2382
02:14:23.400 --> 02:14:26.070
really see,
I mean,
he's very,
very proactive.

2383
02:14:26.070 --> 02:14:29.430
He's always searching for new things and is very open about it and talking about

2384
02:14:29.431 --> 02:14:32.370
it.
But the ketamine does seem to have helped him quite a bit.

2385
02:14:32.371 --> 02:14:35.160
And he was telling me like,
man,
he's like,
this is so fucking crazy.

2386
02:14:35.161 --> 02:14:38.400
I'm going to this doctor's office and having these full blown psychedelic

2387
02:14:38.401 --> 02:14:40.390
experiences at the doctor's office.
Yeah.

2388
02:14:41.150 --> 02:14:43.380
And then two hours later you're out on the street feeling completely normal.

2389
02:14:43.410 --> 02:14:46.800
What was your ketamine experience like?
Uh,
I took a tablet.

2390
02:14:47.070 --> 02:14:50.100
You put it under your tongue and let it dissolve for for 10 minutes.

2391
02:14:50.520 --> 02:14:54.120
And then I laid on a sofa in a therapist office for two hours when I was out on

2392
02:14:54.121 --> 02:14:57.060
the street again,
two hours later.
So how long did it take before kicked in?

2393
02:14:58.740 --> 02:15:02.340
I don't really know because I never thought it was kicking in.
Um,

2394
02:15:02.370 --> 02:15:05.490
but then I just found myself saying things and concluding things that I wouldn't

2395
02:15:05.491 --> 02:15:06.570
normally say.

2396
02:15:06.570 --> 02:15:10.770
And for the next week and a half I just felt like that was just a weight off.

2397
02:15:11.040 --> 02:15:15.930
Did you have any sort of a hallucinogenic experience?
None.
What's thing?

2398
02:15:15.990 --> 02:15:20.740
No hallucinating all,
listen to listen to music quite quietly.
But I,

2399
02:15:20.850 --> 02:15:23.010
you know,
I must go on for a few minutes here and there.

2400
02:15:23.400 --> 02:15:27.500
Sometimes it didn't talk at all.
Um,
but yeah,

2401
02:15:27.520 --> 02:15:29.790
just there was just this relief,
especially afterwards,
like in the,

2402
02:15:29.791 --> 02:15:32.610
in the week and a half or so off.
So it's just felt this,
just this lightness.

2403
02:15:33.640 --> 02:15:37.140
And you know,
to your point about Neil being so open to trying everything,

2404
02:15:37.141 --> 02:15:37.770
even that,

2405
02:15:37.770 --> 02:15:41.340
even taking that step is hard know sometimes even getting out the door.
Sure.

2406
02:15:41.341 --> 02:15:43.770
As hard,
let alone researching this stuff and trying everything.
I mean,

2407
02:15:43.771 --> 02:15:46.890
when I first moved to America,
I said,
okay,
you're not going to do yoga.

2408
02:15:46.950 --> 02:15:47.820
You're not going to do therapy.

2409
02:15:47.821 --> 02:15:49.800
You're not going to prescription drugs that's in New York.

2410
02:15:49.810 --> 02:15:54.420
Bullshit not to drop that.
Let's get to skepticism and to try everything.

2411
02:15:54.421 --> 02:15:58.560
You can be genuinely open to everything.
That's,
that's,
that's a lot in itself.

2412
02:15:58.740 --> 02:16:01.170
While it's hard for people to try anything new,
I mean,

2413
02:16:01.171 --> 02:16:04.260
you have to respect anytime anyone does anything new the first time.

2414
02:16:04.261 --> 02:16:06.870
But person straps on a pair of running shoes and goes for a jog,

2415
02:16:07.170 --> 02:16:10.680
it's fucking hard.
Yeah.
It's hard to just do something.
It's hard to change gears.

2416
02:16:10.770 --> 02:16:13.800
Yep.
And we'll be curious enough to try it in the first place.

2417
02:16:13.801 --> 02:16:16.320
You have to be open to the idea.
Not just be curious.
I mean,

2418
02:16:16.321 --> 02:16:20.730
in the case of taking something like ketamine brave,
you have to be brave.
I mean,

2419
02:16:20.820 --> 02:16:25.290
you're,
once you take,
you can't untake Aa,
you're on a ride.
Yeah.

2420
02:16:25.560 --> 02:16:28.440
They'd take the first MDA session was as frightened,

2421
02:16:28.441 --> 02:16:29.980
more frightening me than going to

2422
02:16:29.980 --> 02:16:34.750
<v 0>Syria or Yemen or how so?
Um,
I guess the vulnerability,</v>

2423
02:16:34.751 --> 02:16:38.260
I just thought I'd say things and accept things that,
that,
you know,

2424
02:16:38.680 --> 02:16:43.300
put up a front against for so long and it's a British thing.

2425
02:16:43.780 --> 02:16:45.070
I think it's very much a British thing,

2426
02:16:45.071 --> 02:16:49.990
but it's also in my identity has been a tough,
brave war correspondent.
Right.

2427
02:16:49.991 --> 02:16:54.730
And you can,
you can like that,
you know,
respected.
Yeah,

2428
02:16:54.780 --> 02:16:59.680
yeah,
yeah.
Um,
and yeah,
I dunno.
I Dunno.

2429
02:17:00.240 --> 02:17:03.460
When I had that feeling of relief in the last,
I think as the last,
no,

2430
02:17:03.461 --> 02:17:05.020
the first session,
sorry about all,

2431
02:17:05.021 --> 02:17:08.170
you could have a family and the dog and kids and enjoy it and be happy.

2432
02:17:08.830 --> 02:17:10.990
There's also a part of me that resisted that and thought,
no,

2433
02:17:10.991 --> 02:17:15.070
that's somehow taking your foot off the gas and somehow losing sight of what's

2434
02:17:15.071 --> 02:17:18.700
important and what your role is and what you can do to actually help things,

2435
02:17:18.760 --> 02:17:23.300
you know,
um,
and just,
you know,
doing whatever is good for you.
Okay.

2436
02:17:23.370 --> 02:17:25.570
<v 3>It seems so conflicted because you obviously great,</v>

2437
02:17:25.600 --> 02:17:30.160
get a great benefit out of this,
this ability to help you,

2438
02:17:30.250 --> 02:17:31.360
and you really do help.

2439
02:17:31.390 --> 02:17:34.660
And you really do put yourself in these incredibly difficult situations.

2440
02:17:34.990 --> 02:17:38.920
So there's,
there's something,
there's a,
there's a positive aspect of it,

2441
02:17:38.950 --> 02:17:42.130
but for sure there's a price of your pain that's pretty substantial.

2442
02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.670
<v 0>Yeah.
And I,
before the MTMA therapy,
I thought,</v>

2443
02:17:45.700 --> 02:17:50.700
if the price is on your own and you're not enjoying the things that most people

2444
02:17:52.270 --> 02:17:56.510
enjoy,
then that's the price you pay.
You know,
that's,
that's,
that's,
you know,

2445
02:17:56.511 --> 02:17:59.550
what you want to do and you'll do it,
whatever the price is.
Um,

2446
02:17:59.950 --> 02:18:02.620
and so I'm open the eyes to the idea of that,
that not being the case.

2447
02:18:04.050 --> 02:18:07.690
<v 3>I hope that's the case.
I hope,
but not being the case.
That actually the case.</v>

2448
02:18:07.810 --> 02:18:10.030
Yeah.
Wilson.
Ben.
Thank you,
man.

2449
02:18:10.060 --> 02:18:11.950
Thanks for coming in here and thanks for everything you do.

2450
02:18:11.980 --> 02:18:16.180
I really appreciate it.
It was great talking to you and,
uh,
I wish you well,
man.

2451
02:18:16.300 --> 02:18:19.810
If there's ever anything we can do,
please let me know.
Thank you.
Thank you.

2452
02:18:20.260 --> 02:18:21.130
Thank you.
Thank you.

2453
02:18:29.590 --> 02:18:29.690
<v 1>Hm.</v>
