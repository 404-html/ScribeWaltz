00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.890
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.121
<v Speaker 1>Here's Hillary.</v>

3
00:00:04.121 --> 00:00:05.090
<v Speaker 1>Hillary turned brown.</v>

4
00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:05.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5
00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:06.980
<v Speaker 1>Flat earthers um,</v>

6
00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:08.380
<v Speaker 1>forests aren't real.</v>

7
00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:09.161
<v Speaker 1>Is that what they're saying?</v>

8
00:00:09.161 --> 00:00:09.610
<v Speaker 1>Jamie?</v>

9
00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.880
<v Speaker 1>The flat earthers we're gonna talk about the flat earthers for one reason.</v>

10
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:13.810
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

11
00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:18.220
<v Speaker 1>the reason why I wanted to bring this up is because I think there's a lot of</v>

12
00:00:18.221 --> 00:00:21.640
<v Speaker 1>folks out there that are super gullible and I think they're being trolled.</v>

13
00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.400
<v Speaker 1>I think they're being trolled by people who put together these,</v>

14
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.620
<v Speaker 1>it's one of two options.</v>

15
00:00:26.621 --> 00:00:30.940
<v Speaker 1>Either they're being trolled by people who put together these elaborate</v>

16
00:00:30.941 --> 00:00:34.270
<v Speaker 1>arguments for something that they don't believe because they're just trying to</v>

17
00:00:34.271 --> 00:00:35.830
<v Speaker 1>make money off of youtube views,</v>

18
00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.240
<v Speaker 1>which is entirely possible.</v>

19
00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:38.920
<v Speaker 1>And this needs to be thought of.</v>

20
00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean really needs to be considered because Lou youtube videos can be extremely</v>

21
00:00:43.481 --> 00:00:47.530
<v Speaker 1>lucrative if you can get a youtube video with millions of hits and a lot of</v>

22
00:00:47.531 --> 00:00:50.560
<v Speaker 1>these videos on all sorts of different conspiracies and all sorts of different</v>

23
00:00:50.561 --> 00:00:53.410
<v Speaker 1>crazy things can generate that kind of volume.</v>

24
00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:54.640
<v Speaker 1>You're making real money,</v>

25
00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:55.780
<v Speaker 1>pennies on the dollar.</v>

26
00:00:55.781 --> 00:00:56.521
<v Speaker 1>But if it's millions,</v>

27
00:00:56.521 --> 00:00:57.010
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

28
00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.340
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

29
00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.570
<v Speaker 1>It starts becoming real money.</v>

30
00:00:58.571 --> 00:00:59.051
<v Speaker 1>It starts in,</v>

31
00:00:59.051 --> 00:01:00.340
<v Speaker 1>if you do a bunch of them and you can,</v>

32
00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:01.570
<v Speaker 1>you do them on a regular basis,</v>

33
00:01:01.571 --> 00:01:02.560
<v Speaker 1>it becomes a Gig.</v>

34
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:03.910
<v Speaker 1>It becomes like what they do.</v>

35
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.430
<v Speaker 1>They create these silly videos,</v>

36
00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.850
<v Speaker 1>but people who just don't have the time or the inclination to actually read</v>

37
00:01:12.371 --> 00:01:16.540
<v Speaker 1>scientific papers and articles and journals and all these different things that</v>

38
00:01:16.541 --> 00:01:21.160
<v Speaker 1>explain how we've known for a long time.</v>

39
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:22.183
<v Speaker 1>The earth is round,</v>

40
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.093
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

41
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.541
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

42
00:01:23.541 --> 00:01:27.300
<v Speaker 1>It's a myth that a Columbus proved that the earth is not flat,</v>

43
00:01:27.301 --> 00:01:28.134
<v Speaker 1>that it's round.</v>

44
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.730
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

45
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:29.541
<v Speaker 1>the ancients knew,</v>

46
00:01:29.541 --> 00:01:30.321
<v Speaker 1>the Greeks knew.</v>

47
00:01:30.321 --> 00:01:31.154
<v Speaker 1>Columbus knew.</v>

48
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.190
<v Speaker 1>Everyone knew a little bit then that it was round and Koreans knew absolutely</v>

49
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.710
<v Speaker 1>depictions on clay,</v>

50
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:40.181
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

51
00:01:40.181 --> 00:01:41.001
<v Speaker 1>Drew it in clay.</v>

52
00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:43.160
<v Speaker 1>They drew all the planets as circles.</v>

53
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.610
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

54
00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:44.330
<v Speaker 1>They knew,</v>

55
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.960
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

56
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's some obvious simple ones anybody could do.</v>

57
00:01:47.391 --> 00:01:48.860
<v Speaker 1>If you see an eclipse,</v>

58
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:49.970
<v Speaker 1>like a lunar eclipse,</v>

59
00:01:49.971 --> 00:01:52.220
<v Speaker 1>you can see the Earth's shadow on the moon.</v>

60
00:01:52.221 --> 00:01:53.054
<v Speaker 1>It's round.</v>

61
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:54.260
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

62
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

63
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:55.130
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

64
00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.510
<v Speaker 1>if you're high enough and you know,</v>

65
00:01:56.511 --> 00:01:57.950
<v Speaker 1>the ships are sailing out,</v>

66
00:01:57.951 --> 00:01:58.970
<v Speaker 1>you can see the mass does.</v>

67
00:01:58.971 --> 00:02:03.290
<v Speaker 1>The last thing you would see as the whole drops over the horizon for slowly.</v>

68
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:04.011
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

69
00:02:04.011 --> 00:02:06.480
<v Speaker 1>there's things like that that we know the earth is round,</v>

70
00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:07.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

71
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.600
<v Speaker 1>you traveled around,</v>

72
00:02:08.601 --> 00:02:09.770
<v Speaker 1>you come back to where you started.</v>

73
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:11.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

74
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.271
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

75
00:02:11.271 --> 00:02:12.320
<v Speaker 1>now their explanation,</v>

76
00:02:12.321 --> 00:02:13.460
<v Speaker 1>the flat earthers is that,</v>

77
00:02:13.461 --> 00:02:13.701
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

78
00:02:13.701 --> 00:02:14.990
<v Speaker 1>it's round like a pizza,</v>

79
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.910
<v Speaker 1>but around flat pizza and all the continents are on the one flat face side up</v>

80
00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.970
<v Speaker 1>and that the satellites are up there going around.</v>

81
00:02:22.971 --> 00:02:23.360
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

82
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.601
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

83
00:02:23.601 --> 00:02:28.370
<v Speaker 1>but the satellite photos don't show all the continents in one picture because</v>

84
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.140
<v Speaker 1>some of them are on the other side of the globe.</v>

85
00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.280
<v Speaker 1>So that refutes that.</v>

86
00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:32.660
<v Speaker 1>Well not only that,</v>

87
00:02:32.661 --> 00:02:36.470
<v Speaker 1>but they think that satellites are actually in planes.</v>

88
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.740
<v Speaker 1>They're in planes and roll Orthopro over that or just circling around.</v>

89
00:02:39.741 --> 00:02:40.970
<v Speaker 1>There's no actual satellites.</v>

90
00:02:40.971 --> 00:02:42.520
<v Speaker 1>They don't even believe in saddle satellites.</v>

91
00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:43.001
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

92
00:02:43.001 --> 00:02:45.310
<v Speaker 1>So back to your original comment,</v>

93
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.970
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

94
00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.150
<v Speaker 1>some of these recent ones are so crazy that you can't help but think,</v>

95
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.750
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

96
00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.530
<v Speaker 1>They don't believe that they're just yanking our chain for maybe financial</v>

97
00:02:53.531 --> 00:02:54.340
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>

98
00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.260
<v Speaker 1>But that does get to the question I always get,</v>

99
00:02:56.261 --> 00:02:57.910
<v Speaker 1>which is do these people really believe it?</v>

100
00:02:57.911 --> 00:02:58.780
<v Speaker 1>The cult leaders,</v>

101
00:02:58.781 --> 00:02:59.140
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

102
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.330
<v Speaker 1>that make a extraordinary claims,</v>

103
00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:02.860
<v Speaker 1>are they just making this stuff up?</v>

104
00:03:02.861 --> 00:03:03.071
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

105
00:03:03.071 --> 00:03:04.360
<v Speaker 1>people make shit up all the time.</v>

106
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.860
<v Speaker 1>It's called fiction fantasy.</v>

107
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.640
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

108
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:07.960
<v Speaker 1>or do they really believe it or they,</v>

109
00:03:07.961 --> 00:03:08.171
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

110
00:03:08.171 --> 00:03:09.430
<v Speaker 1>true believers and you know,</v>

111
00:03:09.431 --> 00:03:10.151
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to tell.</v>

112
00:03:10.151 --> 00:03:11.770
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to get inside people's heads.</v>

113
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.520
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

114
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.710
<v Speaker 1>the old flat earthers in the 19th century,</v>

115
00:03:14.711 --> 00:03:16.090
<v Speaker 1>I think they really did believe it.</v>

116
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.780
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

117
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.040
<v Speaker 1>there wasn't much money to be made,</v>

118
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.581
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

119
00:03:18.581 --> 00:03:19.750
<v Speaker 1>on those kinds of things.</v>

120
00:03:19.751 --> 00:03:23.470
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned the Alfred Russell Wallace who was the co-discoverer of natural</v>

121
00:03:23.471 --> 00:03:24.400
<v Speaker 1>selection with Darwin.</v>

122
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.090
<v Speaker 1>I wrote my dissertation on him and wrote a biography of him and he was quite the</v>

123
00:03:28.091 --> 00:03:32.560
<v Speaker 1>colorful character who is so open minded to new ideas that he was also gullible.</v>

124
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.510
<v Speaker 1>So open minded enough to see this radical new theory of the evolution of life by</v>

125
00:03:37.511 --> 00:03:38.920
<v Speaker 1>natural selection that's good.</v>

126
00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.910
<v Speaker 1>Pioneered other fields like biogeography and so on.</v>

127
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.840
<v Speaker 1>But he also was really into spiritualism and phrenology,</v>

128
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.320
<v Speaker 1>seances handling all that stuff.</v>

129
00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:55.330
<v Speaker 1>And then he encountered an ad in one of the natural history magazines for this</v>

130
00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.360
<v Speaker 1>500 pound bet.</v>

131
00:03:58.361 --> 00:04:00.160
<v Speaker 1>If anybody could prove the earth is round.</v>

132
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.300
<v Speaker 1>So he devised a test and he went down to the Bedford canal,</v>

133
00:04:04.301 --> 00:04:05.021
<v Speaker 1>which is a long,</v>

134
00:04:05.021 --> 00:04:05.531
<v Speaker 1>straight,</v>

135
00:04:05.531 --> 00:04:06.250
<v Speaker 1>like 10,</v>

136
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.330
<v Speaker 1>10 kilometers long.</v>

137
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.920
<v Speaker 1>You can see the whole distance and if you put these little sticks in the ground</v>

138
00:04:11.921 --> 00:04:14.500
<v Speaker 1>with markers on them and you get a little telescope like,</v>

139
00:04:14.501 --> 00:04:14.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

140
00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:15.550
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

141
00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.641
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

142
00:04:15.641 --> 00:04:18.130
<v Speaker 1>surveyors scope and you line it up,</v>

143
00:04:18.131 --> 00:04:19.690
<v Speaker 1>you can see that it bends.</v>

144
00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.180
<v Speaker 1>So at each point the stick is,</v>

145
00:04:22.181 --> 00:04:22.361
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

146
00:04:22.361 --> 00:04:24.430
<v Speaker 1>three meters above the ground at each point.</v>

147
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:25.420
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

148
00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.640
<v Speaker 1>but you can see that it's dropped down in the last one.</v>

149
00:04:27.641 --> 00:04:28.270
<v Speaker 1>So it's been,</v>

150
00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.110
<v Speaker 1>so he won the bet,</v>

151
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.420
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't get paid of course,</v>

152
00:04:31.421 --> 00:04:32.620
<v Speaker 1>because these people are cranks.</v>

153
00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:33.401
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

154
00:04:33.401 --> 00:04:34.390
<v Speaker 1>so we had to take him to court.</v>

155
00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.810
<v Speaker 1>This ended up costing him about 15 years of his career,</v>

156
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.991
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

157
00:04:37.991 --> 00:04:39.130
<v Speaker 1>just wasting time,</v>

158
00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:39.411
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

159
00:04:39.411 --> 00:04:42.990
<v Speaker 1>writing letters and getting court dates and suing this guy and you know,</v>

160
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.421
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

161
00:04:43.421 --> 00:04:44.290
<v Speaker 1>The try to win the bet.</v>

162
00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.441
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

163
00:04:44.441 --> 00:04:45.280
<v Speaker 1>just try to win the bet.</v>

164
00:04:45.281 --> 00:04:45.940
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

165
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.440
<v Speaker 1>and of course what happens,</v>

166
00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.140
<v Speaker 1>you get caught up emotionally,</v>

167
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.330
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

168
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to let this bastard get away with this.</v>

169
00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.851
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

170
00:04:51.851 --> 00:04:53.560
<v Speaker 1>you should have just cut his losses and laugh.</v>

171
00:04:53.561 --> 00:04:54.394
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>

172
00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.910
<v Speaker 1>and I found these letters that this guy wrote to the National Jager or the,</v>

173
00:04:57.911 --> 00:04:58.250
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

174
00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

175
00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.000
<v Speaker 1>the Royal Geographical Society about,</v>

176
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

177
00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:02.950
<v Speaker 1>Alfred Russell Wallace.</v>

178
00:05:02.951 --> 00:05:03.131
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

179
00:05:03.131 --> 00:05:06.520
<v Speaker 1>you have one member of your society that should be,</v>

180
00:05:06.521 --> 00:05:06.671
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

181
00:05:06.671 --> 00:05:08.140
<v Speaker 1>he's a quack and a crank and,</v>

182
00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:08.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

183
00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.350
<v Speaker 1>and he wrote letters to the two Wallace's wife,</v>

184
00:05:11.351 --> 00:05:11.621
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

185
00:05:11.621 --> 00:05:15.370
<v Speaker 1>you better not sleep in your bed at night quietly because I'm coming to get you</v>

186
00:05:15.371 --> 00:05:15.701
<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>

187
00:05:15.701 --> 00:05:16.050
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

188
00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.960
<v Speaker 1>you look like death threats.</v>

189
00:05:16.961 --> 00:05:17.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

190
00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.981
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

191
00:05:17.981 --> 00:05:18.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

192
00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.571
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

193
00:05:18.571 --> 00:05:18.801
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

194
00:05:18.801 --> 00:05:19.060
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

195
00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.990
<v Speaker 1>it's always questionable deal with cranks because some of them are a little,</v>

196
00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:23.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

197
00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:24.820
<v Speaker 1>mentally deranged.</v>

198
00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.661
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

199
00:05:25.661 --> 00:05:29.860
<v Speaker 1>And they can attach themselves to someone like Wallace or Darwin or anybody</v>

200
00:05:29.861 --> 00:05:30.230
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

201
00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:34.150
<v Speaker 1>If you can somehow or another connect yourself to them and some sort of an</v>

202
00:05:34.151 --> 00:05:34.720
<v Speaker 1>argument,</v>

203
00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.280
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of legitimizes you,</v>

204
00:05:36.281 --> 00:05:37.180
<v Speaker 1>at least in a way,</v>

205
00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:38.950
<v Speaker 1>because that person's giving you attention.</v>

206
00:05:38.951 --> 00:05:42.040
<v Speaker 1>The person is engaging you and it elevates your standing.</v>

207
00:05:42.041 --> 00:05:44.020
<v Speaker 1>And then whenever two people are arguing,</v>

208
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.780
<v Speaker 1>a certain amount of people are going to choose sides.</v>

209
00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:47.280
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

210
00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:47.960
<v Speaker 1>they're just gonna.</v>

211
00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:48.970
<v Speaker 1>Even if that,</v>

212
00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:50.530
<v Speaker 1>what you're saying doesn't make any sense,</v>

213
00:05:50.531 --> 00:05:51.820
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be a gang of people that go,</v>

214
00:05:51.821 --> 00:05:52.091
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

215
00:05:52.091 --> 00:05:52.361
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

216
00:05:52.361 --> 00:05:53.194
<v Speaker 1>what are you saying?</v>

217
00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.870
<v Speaker 1>And they're going to join in and people love,</v>

218
00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:57.760
<v Speaker 1>they love to be on a team.</v>

219
00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:07.990
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
