<v Speaker 1>He's on BBC radio,</v>

58
00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:10.351
<v Speaker 1>which I've done before and they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>very polite and you don't go into depth </v>

59
00:03:10.931 --> 00:03:13.750
<v Speaker 1>about anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no flavor to it at all.</v>

60
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:19.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>BBC radio is like the most bland flavor </v>

61
00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.390
<v Speaker 1>list.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Emotionless.</v>

62
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.390
<v Speaker 1>It's like pbs accent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like pbs.</v>

63
00:03:22.391 --> 00:03:24.110
<v Speaker 1>If it was tired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

64
00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.410
<v Speaker 1>PBS.</v>

00:03:27.851 --> 00:03:29.710
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Terrible radio.</v>

67
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.470
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but stan hope did it and he's talking to</v>

68
00:03:32.471 --> 00:03:32.860
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

00:03:32.861 --> 00:03:33.230

70
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.280
<v Speaker 1>they can't get an in depth about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he's forced to have sort of a polite </v>

71
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.611
<v Speaker 1>conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he doesn't want to give the people </v>

72
00:03:41.611 --> 00:03:41.860
<v Speaker 1>the wrong impression that this is going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be like what they come to see,</v>

73
00:03:41.861 --> 00:03:46.861
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people don't know what kind of </v>

<v Speaker 1>comedy you do and Stan hope is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

75
00:03:46.861 --> 00:03:50.940
<v Speaker 1>remarkably offensive and especially if </v>

00:04:00.451 --> 00:04:05.451
<v Speaker 1>just in case you don't believe us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Mr Stan hope has a very offensive </v>

81
00:04:05.451 --> 00:04:05.451
<v Speaker 1>standup comedy.</v>

82
00:04:05.451 --> 00:04:08.260

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

85
00:04:13.721 --> 00:04:15.790

<v Speaker 1>He got to find even go on that show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

87
00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:22.480
<v Speaker 1>what he's saying is that what the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>are saying was that what this guy did in</v>

88
00:04:22.481 --> 00:04:26.120
<v Speaker 1>referencing that is like sort of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>what extent,</v>

89
00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.290
<v Speaker 1>what's the rule?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you don't condone it.</v>

90
00:04:29.291 --> 00:04:31.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like condoning it by telling people</v>

91
00:04:31.811 --> 00:04:34.810
<v Speaker 1>about it at all your advertising.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sort of.</v>

92
00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.060
<v Speaker 1>Which I can see that what they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

93
00:04:37.061 --> 00:04:42.061
<v Speaker 1>but so fucking what on the level of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>is present material.</v>

94
00:04:42.491 --> 00:04:46.570
<v Speaker 1>He's telling you that it's offensive if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't believe in washes bit.</v>

95
00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.750
<v Speaker 1>So if you don't believe him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know and you've watched the bit and </v>

96
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:52.090
<v Speaker 1>you get offended and then you get mad.</v>

97
00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:57.090
<v Speaker 1>You're a fucking moron.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the dumbest fucking thing </v>

98
00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:58.000
<v Speaker 1>I've ever heard in my life saying I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>not taking your word for it.</v>

99
00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.870
<v Speaker 1>Going there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

100
00:04:58.871 --> 00:05:00.280
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should have taken your word for it.</v>

101
00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.210
<v Speaker 1>It's outrageous that anyone could </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly complain.</v>

102
00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.450
<v Speaker 1>This guy is interviewing a comic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

103
00:05:07.451 --> 00:05:12.451
<v Speaker 1>And in the interview,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the comic stains within the lines of </v>

104
00:05:12.451 --> 00:05:12.520
<v Speaker 1>whatever parameters a behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

105
00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.520
<v Speaker 1>they find acceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't go out of those lines at all.</v>

106
00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.510
<v Speaker 1>Just polite conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they wanted to let people know,</v>

107
00:05:19.511 --> 00:05:20.800
<v Speaker 1>so he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't believe us,</v>

108
00:05:20.801 --> 00:05:25.801
<v Speaker 1>watch this bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then people were going fucking </v>

109
00:05:25.801 --> 00:05:25.801
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're calling for this guy's head.</v>

110
00:05:25.801 --> 00:05:27.790
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible how.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is going on?</v>

111
00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.880
<v Speaker 1>Why is everybody becoming such a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 1>of content and pussies because it feels </v>

112
00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.470
<v Speaker 1>like more than ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they do.</v>

113
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.640
<v Speaker 1>Is that that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it right?</v>

114
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:42.300
<v Speaker 1>Is it frustration and their own lives </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they find something where they can </v>

115
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.240
<v Speaker 1>score on something where they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking tee off on.</v>

116
00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.520
<v Speaker 1>They just go at times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really is like A.</v>

117
00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.230
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to hear that and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking annoying.</v>

118
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.170
<v Speaker 1>Fucking annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if it's during their faith,</v>

119
00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:51.910
<v Speaker 1>but I think usually it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

120
00:05:51.911 --> 00:05:54.120
<v Speaker 1>is that yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't be promoted event anyway.</v>

121
00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:59.190
<v Speaker 1>And if people just go overboard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I don't even want to exist in the </v>

122
00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:01.840
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get mad whenever anyone references </v>

123
00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:01.840
<v Speaker 1>is trying to kill it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

124
00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.420
<v Speaker 1>it's that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's a self righteous indignation.</v>

125
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:05.760
<v Speaker 1>It's just so fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

126
00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:11.010
<v Speaker 1>There's so many people that are looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a moment to be angry shit on other </v>

127
00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.510
<v Speaker 1>people for the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're not Christian enough,</v>

128
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.580
<v Speaker 1>you're not anything enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever the fuck.</v>

129
00:06:13.581 --> 00:06:14.780
<v Speaker 1>And that's all it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is just a.</v>

130
00:06:14.781 --> 00:06:16.430
<v Speaker 1>it's just a religious thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all it's left.</v>

131
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:19.730
<v Speaker 1>Why the fuck is it so hard for people to</v>
<v Speaker 1>leave other people alone?</v>

132
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:21.650
<v Speaker 1>It's telling you it's offensive stuff.</v>

133
00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:22.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

134
00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.090
<v Speaker 1>If you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're into Jesus or whatever,</v>

135
00:06:24.091 --> 00:06:26.780
<v Speaker 1>I just don't watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is it so hard for kids to watch it?</v>

136
00:06:26.781 --> 00:06:28.340
<v Speaker 1>Even if they watch it and they get </v>
<v Speaker 1>upset,</v>

137
00:06:28.341 --> 00:06:29.150
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.610
<v Speaker 1>he said that guy's an ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll never go see him live.</v>

139
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:35.570
<v Speaker 1>Mean why do they get so upset?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They attack the DJ from mentioning it.</v>

140
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta be you gotta be a fucking </v>

141
00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:41.560

142

<v Speaker 1>You're going to use your time for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like really?</v>

<v Speaker 1>I Dunno who the fuck does remember that </v>

146
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.590
<v Speaker 1>lady that Patrice O'Neal was fighting </v>
<v Speaker 1>with on MSNBC or Fox News?</v>

147
00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:55.420
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

148
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:58.370
<v Speaker 1>like that type of woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She represents the people who complain.</v>

149
00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:00.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck man.</v>

150
00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:01.750
<v Speaker 1>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

151
00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:04.250
<v Speaker 1>you don't even really understand what </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's even been said.</v>

152
00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:09.520
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to this woman and she had </v>
<v Speaker 1>told me in the middle of the </v>

153
00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.940
<v Speaker 1>conversation about some letter that she </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote to some,</v>

154
00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:14.600
<v Speaker 1>some something I forget it was a show or</v>
<v Speaker 1>a product and shit,</v>

155
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:20.110
<v Speaker 1>but she was going off about how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I wrote them a letter telling them </v>

156
00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:20.360
<v Speaker 1>that I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't find the Algo really.</v>

157
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.750
<v Speaker 1>You wrote them a letter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like really the only reason to do,</v>

158
00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:28.760
<v Speaker 1>to write a letter to accompany is for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the back to school reason when I'm in </v>

159
00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:32.591
<v Speaker 1>summer school with Mark Harmon wherein </v>
<v Speaker 1>you get free shades and things like </v>

160
00:07:32.591 --> 00:07:32.591
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

161
00:07:32.591 --> 00:07:34.910
<v Speaker 1>Writing a letter I remember hearing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you all to do is complain.</v>

162
00:07:34.911 --> 00:07:37.430
<v Speaker 1>I got some bunk Gillette razors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's up?</v>

163
00:07:37.431 --> 00:07:39.350
<v Speaker 1>I think you're razors rule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is bullshit</v>

164
00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:44.280
<v Speaker 3>all the time and they were mostly </v>
<v Speaker 3>restaurants were the best because like I</v>

165
00:07:44.281 --> 00:07:46.660
<v Speaker 3>would go to a restaurant and even if it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was just mediocre,</v>

166
00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:51.780
<v Speaker 3>instead of just writing a review,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll just send a letter to like </v>

167
00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:51.780
<v Speaker 3>applebee's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like dude,</v>

168
00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:51.940
<v Speaker 3>I went to applebee's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The waiter was like,</v>

169
00:07:51.941 --> 00:07:53.620
<v Speaker 3>coming 20 minutes for a soup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

170
00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:55.990
<v Speaker 3>They'll send you a gift certificate back</v>
<v Speaker 3>for $50,</v>

171
00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:56.650
<v Speaker 3>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah.</v>

172
00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:00.450
<v Speaker 1>Ever seen anybody in person trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>run that scam and a restaurant?</v>

173
00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:04.050
<v Speaker 1>What complaint?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fake scam.</v>

174
00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:06.330
<v Speaker 1>I've seen real complaints from like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jewish Delis,</v>

175
00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:11.540
<v Speaker 1>but there's plenty of people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>complained like this soup is cold or </v>

176
00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:11.540
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

177
00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:13.210
<v Speaker 1>corn beef is rough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

178
00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:14.700
<v Speaker 1>that's all legit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

179
00:08:14.701 --> 00:08:18.030
<v Speaker 1>I had to send a Pastrami Rueben back </v>
<v Speaker 1>once at Jerry's famous deli.</v>

180
00:08:18.031 --> 00:08:20.850
<v Speaker 1>It turns out they cut it the wrong way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't bad,</v>

181
00:08:20.851 --> 00:08:23.280
<v Speaker 1>but if you cut it one way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's real rough fight,</v>

182
00:08:23.281 --> 00:08:23.860
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

183
00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:25.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you cut it another way,</v>

184
00:08:25.021 --> 00:08:27.490
<v Speaker 1>it breaks up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is incredible when you think about</v>

185
00:08:27.491 --> 00:08:27.850
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

186
00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:30.000
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't brisk is the same way you got to</v>

187
00:08:30.001 --> 00:08:31.080
<v Speaker 1>go with the greater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets good.</v>

188
00:08:31.081 --> 00:08:33.900
<v Speaker 1>I forget which one is you just move your</v>
<v Speaker 1>hand like to the left,</v>

189
00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:39.840
<v Speaker 1>but what it is is cut it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you cut it with the tendon,</v>

190
00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:42.840
<v Speaker 1>like w go along the grand attendant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is apparently the wrong way.</v>

191
00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.610
<v Speaker 1>Then it's like chewing these tendons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tendons,</v>

192
00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:46.980
<v Speaker 1>wrong word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>muscle fibers,</v>

193
00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:49.350
<v Speaker 1>but if you cut it against it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>

194
00:08:49.351 --> 00:08:52.380
<v Speaker 1>then it comes to that brisket he showed </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

195
00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:53.100
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

196
00:08:53.101 --> 00:08:55.530
<v Speaker 1>if I cut it wrong and give me a little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just takes.</v>

197
00:08:55.531 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 1>It just</v>

198
00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:57.780
<v Speaker 4>bites rotten.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

199
00:08:57.781 --> 00:08:59.830
<v Speaker 4>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

200
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:01.670
<v Speaker 4>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was going to say something.</v>

201
00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:03.080

<v Speaker 4>You can play.</v>

202
00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:04.410
<v Speaker 4>That was the one that was the only thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>ever.</v>

203
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.230
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The people that are much more important.</v>

204

<v Speaker 4>it was a clumsy one.</v>

271
00:11:07.381 --> 00:11:11.010
<v Speaker 4>Like they were there being way too </v>
<v Speaker 4>honest about it and the,</v>

272
00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:13.680
<v Speaker 4>what they were complaining about was way</v>
<v Speaker 4>too little.</v>

273
00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:18.830
<v Speaker 4>It was of the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like whether you should get up and </v>

274
00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:18.830
<v Speaker 4>leave immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not like you're halfway through the</v>

275
00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:18.830
<v Speaker 4>meal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then it got bad.</v>

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:19.950
<v Speaker 4>You're complaining from the start.</v>

<v Speaker 4>They were combined.</v>

278
00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:22.860
<v Speaker 4>They complained about a few different </v>
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

279
00:11:22.861 --> 00:11:25.560
<v Speaker 4>It took me a while to tune into them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was like a certain,</v>

280
00:11:25.561 --> 00:11:28.860
<v Speaker 4>like certain country noise from behind </v>
<v Speaker 4>me,</v>

281
00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:32.010
<v Speaker 4>so it took me a while to tune into it </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then once I tuned into it,</v>

282
00:11:32.011 --> 00:11:35.250
<v Speaker 4>then we actually watched them try to </v>
<v Speaker 4>scam these waiters and then,</v>

283
00:11:35.251 --> 00:11:40.251
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the waiter had to bring over a manager </v>

284
00:11:40.251 --> 00:11:41.931
<v Speaker 4>and the waiter clearly said to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>manager that these people are scamming </v>

285
00:11:41.931 --> 00:11:41.931
<v Speaker 4>because there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the manager came back.</v>

286
00:11:41.931 --> 00:11:43.920
<v Speaker 4>He was like a stone face killer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I'm confused.</v>

292
00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:54.070
<v Speaker 4>Here is why you would</v>

293
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:55.710
<v Speaker 1>think that we would compensate you for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that sir.</v>

294
00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:56.770
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

295
00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:00.190

<v Speaker 1>This is an excellent restaurant.</v>

296
00:12:00.191 --> 00:12:02.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can just shut the guy down.</v>

297
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:03.850
<v Speaker 1>And.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was ugly,</v>

298
00:12:03.851 --> 00:12:08.851
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that lasted for like 15 minutes and it </v>

299
00:12:08.851 --> 00:12:08.851
<v Speaker 1>required everybody to pay attention to </v>
<v Speaker 1>it because it was,</v>

300
00:12:08.851 --> 00:12:09.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're in a restaurant and all of a</v>

301
00:12:09.911 --> 00:12:14.911
<v Speaker 1>sudden some shit goes wrong at some </v>
<v Speaker 1>table and you hear people raise their </v>

302
00:12:14.911 --> 00:12:18.121
<v Speaker 1>voices like you have to pay attention at</v>
<v Speaker 1>least part of it because someone might </v>

303
00:12:18.121 --> 00:12:22.621
<v Speaker 1>pull out a fucking gun or somebody might</v>
<v Speaker 1>punch somebody or commands your </v>

304
00:12:22.621 --> 00:12:22.770
<v Speaker 1>attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but your,</v>

305
00:12:22.771 --> 00:12:25.090
<v Speaker 1>your warning signals go off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least mine do.</v>

306
00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.950
<v Speaker 1>When I see people arguing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always say,</v>

307
00:12:26.951 --> 00:12:27.790
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is,</v>

308
00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:32.820
<v Speaker 1>what's going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much do I have to pay attention to </v>

309
00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:34.891
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the threat level I'm assessing </v>

310
00:12:34.891 --> 00:12:34.891
<v Speaker 1>here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

311
00:12:34.891 --> 00:12:35.980
<v Speaker 1>when people are in the middle of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking yelling at each other.</v>

312
00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:41.220
<v Speaker 1>So I had to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to pay attention to these </v>

313
00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:41.220
<v Speaker 1>scumbags,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was weird.</v>

314
00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:41.560
<v Speaker 1>It's weird singling people running </v>
<v Speaker 1>scams,</v>

315
00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:46.650
<v Speaker 1>like it's one thing to be a kid in Ohio </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to get fucking free lollipops or </v>

316
00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:46.990
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to be.</v>

317
00:12:46.991 --> 00:12:51.991
<v Speaker 1>A grown man in his forties with a woman </v>
<v Speaker 1>who was clearly in on it and they're </v>

318
00:12:51.991 --> 00:12:52.900
<v Speaker 1>trying to work this shit.</v>

319
00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:57.950
<v Speaker 3>I feel bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the idea is that when he was </v>

320
00:12:57.950 --> 00:13:00.351
<v Speaker 3>younger he robbed banks and mugged fags.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I feel bad about my past but it's </v>

321
00:13:00.541 --> 00:13:05.541
<v Speaker 3>not as bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I used to do the scam when I was </v>

322
00:13:05.541 --> 00:13:05.541
<v Speaker 3>like 18,</v>
<v Speaker 3>17,</v>

323
00:13:05.541 --> 00:13:08.880
<v Speaker 3>I would go to these diners just to smoke</v>
<v Speaker 3>cigarettes and drink coffee and I had no</v>

324
00:13:08.881 --> 00:13:13.881
<v Speaker 3>money and so what I would do is once in </v>
<v Speaker 3>a while I had chest hair when I was in </v>

325
00:13:13.881 --> 00:13:15.540
<v Speaker 3>high school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once in awhile I would just be like,</v>

326

<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who wants free meals?</v>

327
00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:17.670

<v Speaker 3>And it goes.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Four or five times at the same place.</v>

<v Speaker 1>brings clipped nails to restaurants and </v>

<v Speaker 1>people may put that in there and they'll</v>

336
00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:43.490
<v Speaker 1>complain about and again get his and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>does it on purpose and he's.</v>

<v Speaker 1>This guy is not a broke guy.</v>

340
00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:51.190
<v Speaker 1>Poor guy running a scam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he brings a little plastic bag,</v>

341
00:13:51.191 --> 00:13:53.140
<v Speaker 1>a little ziploc bag of nail clippings.</v>

342
00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:58.420
<v Speaker 3>Me and my friend Shane once I went to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Arby's and you know there's a fountain </v>

343
00:13:58.420 --> 00:13:59.480
<v Speaker 3>drinks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have these little black nozzles and</v>

344
00:13:59.481 --> 00:14:04.481
<v Speaker 3>if you've worked in a restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like what you usually take out to </v>

345
00:14:04.481 --> 00:14:04.481
<v Speaker 3>clean every night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I put it in and twist it.</v>

346
00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:09.670
<v Speaker 3>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got a drink and that black nozzle </v>

347
00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:12.521
<v Speaker 3>fell into his glass and so we went to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we went home and this is like when I </v>

348
00:14:12.521 --> 00:14:14.660
<v Speaker 3>first got a video camera and he opened </v>
<v Speaker 3>it up and he was like,</v>

349
00:14:14.661 --> 00:14:16.640
<v Speaker 3>what is this thing after he's drank half</v>
<v Speaker 3>of it,</v>

350
00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:18.470
<v Speaker 3>so what's this thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he pulls it out and stuff,</v>

351
00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:23.510
<v Speaker 3>black nozzle and inside it is just mold </v>
<v Speaker 3>this most disgusting shit ever.</v>

352
00:14:23.901 --> 00:14:28.901
<v Speaker 3>So we filmed it and we went to Arby's </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's just like bitching at the </v>

353
00:14:28.901 --> 00:14:32.081
<v Speaker 3>manager and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and like we filmed the whole thing and </v>

354
00:14:32.081 --> 00:14:32.081
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I want some free shit.</v>

356
00:14:32.081 --> 00:14:33.320
<v Speaker 3>And like it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he turned it into like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>And the funny thing is she wouldn't give</v>

361
00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:44.840
<v Speaker 3>in the video,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>are you kidding me?</v>

366
00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:53.330
<v Speaker 3>We could send this to the fucking news.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I have that video.</v>

370
00:14:57.591 --> 00:14:59.870
<v Speaker 3>So she was right.</v>

<v Speaker 3>She's long dead.</v>

372

<v Speaker 3>But if you look at that video,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll come to sky did like it.</v>

373
00:15:06.891 --> 00:15:08.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it was the internet days,</v>

374
00:15:08.001 --> 00:15:10.940
<v Speaker 3>I sent that picture of just that nozzle </v>
<v Speaker 3>to argue to find that video.</v>

375
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.880
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The restaurants are as clean as we are.</v>

376
00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:14.030
<v Speaker 3>When you think about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

377
00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:17.450
<v Speaker 3>all those fucking lazy people where </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not cleaning up the restaurants.</v>

378
00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:22.460
<v Speaker 3>They're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You ever see a clean kitchen nightmares </v>

379
00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:22.700
<v Speaker 3>with one of the best TV shows every day </v>
<v Speaker 3>from Gordon Ramsey,</v>

380
00:15:22.701 --> 00:15:25.620
<v Speaker 3>but I think they canceled it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have the UK version,</v>

381
00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:30.650
<v Speaker 3>the American version,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the UK version or an American </v>

382
00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:30.650
<v Speaker 3>restaurants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

383
00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:33.770
<v Speaker 3>Dara.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They go to places where they're just a </v>

384
00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:33.770
<v Speaker 3>wreck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

385
00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:35.951
<v Speaker 3>But what sucks is like there's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>restaurant down the street from me in </v>

386
00:15:35.951 --> 00:15:39.011
<v Speaker 3>Burbank that was on that show and it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the worst episodes and in what </v>

387
00:15:39.011 --> 00:15:39.500
<v Speaker 3>you can get on torrents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

388
00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:43.100
<v Speaker 3>there's one Mexican restaurant where </v>
<v Speaker 3>they go in the back and I guess a lot of</v>

389
00:15:43.101 --> 00:15:46.630
<v Speaker 3>Mexican restaurants do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have a big bucket that they get,</v>

390
00:15:46.631 --> 00:15:51.631
<v Speaker 3>like at home depot and they just put all</v>
<v Speaker 3>the beans in it and they had these </v>

391
00:15:51.631 --> 00:15:52.930
<v Speaker 3>bucket of beans where they just scoop </v>
<v Speaker 3>out everyday and like,</v>

392
00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:54.350
<v Speaker 3>here's your beans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's your beans.</v>

393
00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.600
<v Speaker 3>They show they pulled that bucket of </v>
<v Speaker 3>beans out.</v>

394
00:15:56.750 --> 00:16:01.750
<v Speaker 3>One side of it was fucking mold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other side was like a breakthrough </v>

395
00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:02.870
<v Speaker 3>where that hard layer and the top layer </v>
<v Speaker 3>was this.</v>

396
00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:08.040
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a Mexican restaurant on there's </v>

397
00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:08.040
<v Speaker 3>mold on the beans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

398
00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:12.141
<v Speaker 3>Dot on one side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was mold in a top layer was so hard </v>

399
00:16:12.141 --> 00:16:15.100
<v Speaker 3>that they broke through like ice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like North Pole style to get the beans </v>

400
00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:15.980
<v Speaker 3>underneath that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're still a.</v>

401
00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:18.290
<v Speaker 3>It was exaggerating this.</v>

402
00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:22.760
<v Speaker 3>If anyone's ever seen this episode,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would know.</v>

403
00:16:22.761 --> 00:16:26.090
<v Speaker 3>I think about every time I go to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mexican restaurant and they served it to</v>

404
00:16:26.091 --> 00:16:29.090
<v Speaker 3>him in the show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why this show is so great because</v>

405
00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:33.020
<v Speaker 3>every episode he goes into the kitchen </v>
<v Speaker 3>and finds the exact same kind of shit.</v>

406
00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:39.410
<v Speaker 3>It freaks you the fuck out where you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't want to eat at a restaurant ever </v>

407
00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:39.410
<v Speaker 3>again after watching that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's on torrence.</v>

408
00:16:39.411 --> 00:16:41.510
<v Speaker 3>Get a kitchen nightmares us version.</v>

409
00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:43.750
<v Speaker 1>God Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

410
00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:44.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot,</v>

411
00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:46.510
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do risk it when you go somewhere and</v>

412
00:16:46.511 --> 00:16:49.480
<v Speaker 1>you buy someone else's preparation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do risk it.</v>

413
00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:53.350
<v Speaker 1>You know the risk it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've worked in restaurants before,</v>

414
00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:54.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

415
00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:59.910
<v Speaker 1>You got a shot at fucking pupil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a curl that I was dating got in trouble </v>

416
00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:01.450
<v Speaker 1>for spitting in someone's spitting in </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's milkshake.</v>

417
00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:05.680
<v Speaker 3>She'll get in a lot of trouble for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That ruins their faith in the system.</v>

418
00:17:05.681 --> 00:17:10.681
<v Speaker 3>That shit happens all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To do that as a waiter all the fucking </v>

419
00:17:10.681 --> 00:17:10.681
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Putting my balls on people's breadsticks</v>

420
00:17:10.681 --> 00:17:10.950
<v Speaker 3>and shit.</v>

421
00:17:11.370 --> 00:17:14.490
<v Speaker 1>I guess the dude was a Dick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so she spit in his fucking milkshake and</v>

422
00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:17.250
<v Speaker 1>that's always an option to be a dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just don't do it.</v>

423
00:17:17.251 --> 00:17:18.210
<v Speaker 1>It's so easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't.</v>

424
00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:23.300
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile she was kind of pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably would have let her spit in his </v>

425
00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:23.300
<v Speaker 1>mouth.</v>

426
00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:23.790
<v Speaker 3>And you mentioned being a cop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to a restaurant.</v>

427
00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:25.920
<v Speaker 3>Can you imagine being a cop?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go into a restaurant?</v>

428
00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:27.810
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many times people probably see a cop</v>

429
00:17:27.811 --> 00:17:29.670
<v Speaker 3>walking into a restaurant and fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>

430
00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:31.020
<v Speaker 3>fuck up that cop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

431
00:17:31.021 --> 00:17:33.900
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially some maids prison.</v>

432
00:17:33.901 --> 00:17:34.740
<v Speaker 3>No one likes them.</v>

433
00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:35.540
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

434
00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:37.820
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately became a meter maid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't even know.</v>

435
00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:41.560
<v Speaker 1>I think for a little while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meet a mate is a terrible job.</v>

436
00:17:41.561 --> 00:17:45.040
<v Speaker 1>You just getting negative energy all day</v>
<v Speaker 1>and nobody's nice to meet her raised.</v>

437
00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:50.290
<v Speaker 1>It would probably change a world if they</v>
<v Speaker 1>would give them the option to stop </v>

438
00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:52.860
<v Speaker 1>through a ticket if they actually could </v>
<v Speaker 1>do that and make some people's days.</v>

439
00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:53.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

440
00:17:53.671 --> 00:17:54.630
<v Speaker 1>They can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or can they?</v>

441
00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:56.250
<v Speaker 1>They always say can't stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once it started.</v>

442
00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:59.300
<v Speaker 1>That was always the stereotype.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cliche is true.</v>

443
00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:01.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if they could,</v>

444
00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:06.470
<v Speaker 1>they went over so many more fans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so God damn ridiculous that you have to </v>

445
00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:08.040
<v Speaker 1>give someone money to put your car </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere.</v>

446
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:11.940
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>

447
00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:15.060
<v Speaker 1>But without that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one will be able to get anywhere.</v>

448
00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:20.340
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So put up a sign that says you can't </v>

449
00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:20.340
<v Speaker 1>park forever and then tow the flux.</v>

450
00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:23.730
<v Speaker 1>It's that simple and it's one thing if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you live in like one of those places,</v>

451
00:18:23.731 --> 00:18:28.731
<v Speaker 1>like in west Hollywood is kind of crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they have all these spots where </v>

452
00:18:28.731 --> 00:18:32.691
<v Speaker 1>you can only park if you're a resident </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's really way too many </v>

453
00:18:32.691 --> 00:18:35.600
<v Speaker 1>people for this area as the residence </v>
<v Speaker 1>would never be able to park and park.</v>

454
00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:37.710
<v Speaker 1>There's too many for the residents as it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

455
00:18:37.711 --> 00:18:38.710
<v Speaker 1>There's too many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just,</v>

456
00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:43.910
<v Speaker 1>there's not enough parking spots for all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cars because it's all these </v>

457
00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:43.950
<v Speaker 1>apartment buildings and everybody in La </v>
<v Speaker 1>drives,</v>

458
00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:49.030
<v Speaker 1>so if you look at an apartment building,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at one area that's not </v>

459
00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:53.241
<v Speaker 1>that big on a block,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but might have 100 units at 40 people </v>

460
00:18:53.241 --> 00:18:53.241
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For cars,</v>

461
00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:56.850
<v Speaker 1>that's 100 cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 cars is like the whole block,</v>

462
00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of other shit on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>block besides sides at apartment </v>

463
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:02.000
<v Speaker 1>building so it becomes a God damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>nightmare.</v>

464
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.440
<v Speaker 1>But that kind of makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like resident parking,</v>

465
00:19:04.441 --> 00:19:05.520
<v Speaker 1>like don't park it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

466
00:19:05.521 --> 00:19:07.080
<v Speaker 1>you know this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people live here.</v>

467
00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:10.380
<v Speaker 1>It sucks if you want to visit somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's better than if you lived.</v>

468
00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:12.480
<v Speaker 1>If you lived there and it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>intolerable everyday,</v>

469
00:19:12.481 --> 00:19:17.481
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't get a parking spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to charge people for parking on the </v>

470
00:19:17.481 --> 00:19:18.480
<v Speaker 1>fucking public streets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>

471
00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:19.550
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

472
00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:24.560
<v Speaker 1>it's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't get any fucking money for </v>

473
00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.910
<v Speaker 1>someone who's shopping in a store once a</v>
<v Speaker 1>pullover that fuck you,</v>

474
00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:28.740
<v Speaker 1>you get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get a dollar for that.</v>

475
00:19:28.741 --> 00:19:29.310
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

476
00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:30.730
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the biggest problem would be though,</v>

477
00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:34.000
<v Speaker 3>if not doing that is then people just </v>
<v Speaker 3>abandoned their cars there in lights,</v>

478
00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:38.070
<v Speaker 3>in their car parking or one hour your </v>
<v Speaker 3>parking.</v>

479
00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:39.430
<v Speaker 3>There has to be some kind of</v>

480
00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:45.170
<v Speaker 1>no parking for more than two hours here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Making across the board that I don't </v>

481
00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:49.340
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind if someone violates a good </v>

482
00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:49.340
<v Speaker 1>normal rule and then you give them a </v>
<v Speaker 1>ticket to kind of keep order,</v>

483
00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:50.040
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey man,</v>

484
00:19:50.041 --> 00:19:52.020
<v Speaker 1>you can't just believe in your car </v>
<v Speaker 1>parked sideways.</v>

485
00:19:52.021 --> 00:19:53.580
<v Speaker 1>Like that Douche bag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get a ticket for that.</v>

486
00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:56.250
<v Speaker 1>But all the meters in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not leaders man.</v>

487
00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:59.270
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's changed.</v>

488
00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:01.510
<v Speaker 3>Especially the long ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you go to la,</v>

489
00:20:01.511 --> 00:20:03.970
<v Speaker 3>there's sometimes there's like 20 signs </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you seriously,</v>

490
00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:09.320
<v Speaker 3>you just have to sit there and it's like</v>
<v Speaker 3>a video game for you to read all the </v>

491
00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:12.631
<v Speaker 3>signs and you got to take it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The last time we were in Pasadena </v>

492
00:20:12.631 --> 00:20:12.880
<v Speaker 3>because it was like no parking for this </v>
<v Speaker 3>hour and this hour.</v>

493
00:20:12.881 --> 00:20:15.340
<v Speaker 3>Tuesdays you can't park here at all </v>
<v Speaker 3>after this time.</v>

494
00:20:15.341 --> 00:20:16.820
<v Speaker 3>And like I just need to take a.</v>

495
00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:22.060
<v Speaker 1>You got to do the math.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to do math when you read the </v>

496
00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:22.060
<v Speaker 1>fucking parking sign.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

497
00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:26.190
<v Speaker 1>The thing is too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you took a photo and you get a ticket </v>

498
00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:26.190
<v Speaker 1>and what are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're really gonna fucking fight it.</v>

499
00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:26.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes forever.</v>

500
00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:30.060
<v Speaker 1>You're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a fucking major ticket for much.</v>

501
00:20:30.061 --> 00:20:32.190
<v Speaker 1>Is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like 60 or $70.</v>

502
00:20:32.191 --> 00:20:34.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's no way,</v>

503
00:20:34.341 --> 00:20:38.510
<v Speaker 1>and I always forget to do that work </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's obviously doubles.</v>

504
00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:40.030
<v Speaker 1>He would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

505
00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:45.040
<v Speaker 1>what really kills me is when cops have </v>
<v Speaker 1>quotas and no cops have quotas that they</v>

506
00:20:45.441 --> 00:20:48.970
<v Speaker 1>have to reach over a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people for a certain amount of things.</v>

507
00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:50.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure that's how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

508
00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:55.810
<v Speaker 3>and that's why I like certain times of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the month you'll see just nonstop cops </v>

509
00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:56.840
<v Speaker 3>pulling people over all the time and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then next week you won't see anything.</v>

510
00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:59.540
<v Speaker 1>But what's crazy is one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if no one commits a crime,</v>

511
00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:05.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if we got everybody to keep their </v>

512
00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:06.020
<v Speaker 1>shit together for a month and these cops</v>
<v Speaker 1>still have quotas.</v>

513
00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:09.450
<v Speaker 1>That would be a crazy movie like of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>town command.</v>

514
00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:10.700
<v Speaker 1>If everyone comes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

515
00:21:10.701 --> 00:21:13.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you had a big savings like boulder,</v>

516
00:21:13.191 --> 00:21:14.720
<v Speaker 1>Colorado,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like 100,000</v>

517
00:21:14.721 --> 00:21:15.550
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you.</v>

518
00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:19.940
<v Speaker 1>You could almost get 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>people to never commit any crimes.</v>

519
00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:24.970
<v Speaker 1>Don't like last week for one month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's show these fucking cops that you </v>

520
00:21:25.071 --> 00:21:27.740
<v Speaker 1>can't have quotas that say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

521
00:21:27.741 --> 00:21:30.260
<v Speaker 1>some people have to be the last week.</v>

522
00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:31.680
<v Speaker 3>Let's try to get everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unfortunately,</v>

523
00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:36.700
<v Speaker 3>our laws are written in such a way where</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could pull you over for anything </v>

524
00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:36.700
<v Speaker 3>they probably want to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

525
00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:38.570
<v Speaker 3>they can find a way to pull you over no </v>
<v Speaker 3>matter what.</v>

526
00:21:38.571 --> 00:21:38.870
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

527
00:21:38.871 --> 00:21:43.871
<v Speaker 3>you didn't turn on your signal three </v>
<v Speaker 3>seconds before you merged into the next </v>

528
00:21:43.871 --> 00:21:44.010
<v Speaker 3>lane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's actually a law,</v>

529
00:21:44.011 --> 00:21:49.011
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or something like that where they can </v>

530
00:21:49.011 --> 00:21:49.011
<v Speaker 3>pull you up for a new instructor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

531
00:21:49.011 --> 00:21:53.231
<v Speaker 3>They get so mad when he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he would be with demoed for not </v>

532
00:21:53.231 --> 00:21:53.231
<v Speaker 3>signaling.</v>

533
00:21:53.231 --> 00:21:57.200
<v Speaker 1>Did you just say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember soul man and then the quota </v>

534
00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:58.020
<v Speaker 1>scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

535
00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:01.540
<v Speaker 3>Behind him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When did the guy,</v>

536
00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:06.570
<v Speaker 3>the white guy talked at tanning pills,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pills and turn black and was following </v>

537
00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:07.630
<v Speaker 3>behind him and then eventually the </v>
<v Speaker 3>swerve.</v>

538
00:22:07.631 --> 00:22:10.600
<v Speaker 3>Because I'm an open their door,</v>
<v Speaker 3>swerved around their door and the couple</v>

539
00:22:10.601 --> 00:22:13.300
<v Speaker 3>of the lights on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was switching lanes without a,</v>

540
00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:15.250
<v Speaker 3>without a signal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How risky was that?</v>

541
00:22:15.251 --> 00:22:18.130
<v Speaker 3>Maybe when that came out last time were </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

542
00:22:18.131 --> 00:22:23.131
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he started dating a black </v>

543
00:22:23.131 --> 00:22:23.360
<v Speaker 3>check.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever happens,</v>

544
00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:26.290
<v Speaker 3>honored with a c Dot Thomas Howell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think of that.</v>

545
00:22:26.291 --> 00:22:27.760
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That guy?</v>

546
00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:29.080
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that kind of vanished.</v>

547
00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:31.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's another Cuba gooding Jr.</v>

548
00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:36.570
<v Speaker 3>A lot of those actors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you understAnd that you reach a </v>

549
00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:36.780
<v Speaker 3>higher level of consciousness and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>just kind of disappeared into the ether?</v>

550
00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:38.740
<v Speaker 3>They like scientologists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

551
00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:43.800
<v Speaker 3>It probably did the right thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their money and live on an island </v>

552
00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:43.800
<v Speaker 3>somewhere and just get out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

553
00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:44.650
<v Speaker 3>That's what I would do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in balboa.</v>

554
00:22:44.651 --> 00:22:46.420
<v Speaker 3>If you ever heard a baobella island.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

555
00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:51.460
<v Speaker 3>It's this island off of newport beach </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it costs a dollar to get over on </v>

556
00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:51.930
<v Speaker 3>this ferry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's awesome.</v>

557
00:22:51.931 --> 00:22:53.860
<v Speaker 3>You just Drive onto this ferry that goes</v>
<v Speaker 3>right over.</v>

558
00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:55.330
<v Speaker 3>It's like a kind of window.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

559
00:22:55.390 --> 00:23:00.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just like lean is hard to get a </v>

560
00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:00.390
<v Speaker 3>ferry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

561
00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:00.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your car over there.</v>

562
00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:04.381
<v Speaker 3>It's expensive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's super small though in the houses </v>

563
00:23:04.381 --> 00:23:07.710
<v Speaker 3>are fucking amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's not even a cop that lives on </v>

564
00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:08.740
<v Speaker 3>this island and people just had their </v>
<v Speaker 3>doors wide open,</v>

565
00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:11.890
<v Speaker 3>so you'd walk by and just see people </v>
<v Speaker 3>like sitting in their house and they had</v>

566
00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:15.450
<v Speaker 3>a starbucks and it was the most peaceful</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking shit ever.</v>

567
00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:19.000
<v Speaker 3>I go in small numbers of people with </v>
<v Speaker 3>money tend to be peaceful.</v>

568
00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:23.870
<v Speaker 3>If I got to a certain amount of money I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>

569
00:23:23.871 --> 00:23:28.871
<v Speaker 3>I think I would just take that money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>invest in something that makes me money </v>

570
00:23:28.871 --> 00:23:29.780
<v Speaker 3>every month and just fucking live </v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere like that is this,</v>

571
00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:32.800
<v Speaker 3>listen that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this what the fuck he's an investor.</v>

572
00:23:33.530 --> 00:23:35.910
<v Speaker 3>Invest in something that makes me money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every simple,</v>

573
00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:39.600
<v Speaker 3>so simple like property renting out </v>
<v Speaker 3>property.</v>

574
00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:41.320
<v Speaker 3>That's probably one of the easiest </v>
<v Speaker 3>things ever.</v>

575
00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:43.270
<v Speaker 1>Not in this day and age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

576
00:23:43.271 --> 00:23:45.130
<v Speaker 1>It's actually really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

577
00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:50.290
<v Speaker 1>a reason why when you drive around and </v>

<v Speaker 1>difference between 99 and 2011 as far as</v>

<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's way less than three years before </v>

<v Speaker 1>weed and to look at it because were </v>
<v Speaker 1>sessions really actually noticed that I </v>

591
00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:30.230
<v Speaker 1>had to stop doing a joke about that.</v>

592
00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:32.120
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are the freeway so packed if,</v>

593

<v Speaker 1>well I think it's just luck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's just someone not </v>

600
00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:48.110
<v Speaker 1>crashing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You fly over in the four or five at five</v>

601
00:24:48.111 --> 00:24:49.880
<v Speaker 1>in the afternoon.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That area.</v>

604
00:24:53.511 --> 00:24:55.980
<v Speaker 1>Like when you're talking about newport </v>
<v Speaker 1>beach for a quick.</v>

610
00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:10.580

<v Speaker 1>InsTead of going by the ocean,</v>

611
00:25:10.581 --> 00:25:11.720
<v Speaker 1>I'd take the 2:10.</v>

612
00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:15.680
<v Speaker 1>I go way the fuck out of my way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like 30 miles longer.</v>

613
00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:17.420
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's way above.</v>

614
00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:20.810
<v Speaker 1>But you cruise when you go away from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ocean,</v>

615
00:25:20.811 --> 00:25:25.811
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

616
00:25:25.811 --> 00:25:25.811
<v Speaker 1>some traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Movement.</v>

617
00:25:25.811 --> 00:25:26.270
<v Speaker 1>You can make some movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get some progress done.</v>

618
00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:29.210
<v Speaker 1>If you go far away from the ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to go away from the ocean and up</v>

619
00:25:29.211 --> 00:25:34.211
<v Speaker 1>high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as soon as you close in on that </v>

<v Speaker 1>ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get like five goes.</v>

00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:42.110
<v Speaker 1>ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all along the shore.</v>

625
00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:44.720

<v Speaker 1>but it's along the shore.</v>

627
00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:50.690
<v Speaker 1>you're traveling the same way that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ocean goes and it's everybody going from</v>

628
00:25:50.691 --> 00:25:55.691
<v Speaker 1>Mexico to California and san diego to </v>

<v Speaker 1>way easier to get to where you need to </v>

636
00:26:14.351 --> 00:26:14.351
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then like saint New York,</v>

637
00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:17.370
<v Speaker 1>if you're in New York and you're fucked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're fucked,</v>

638
00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:19.820

<v Speaker 1>need to get to manhattan,</v>

639
00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:24.850
<v Speaker 1>you've got a couple of different bridges</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can take and they're both fucked up </v>

640
00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:28.240
<v Speaker 1>or you can go in on the 95,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do that and that's going to be </v>

641
00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:28.240
<v Speaker 1>fucked up too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

642
00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:28.520
<v Speaker 1>don't try.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good luck.</v>

643
00:26:28.521 --> 00:26:29.630
<v Speaker 1>Stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

644
00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:34.740
<v Speaker 1>The city to get into manhattan is like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to have an active case that they </v>

645
00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:39.701
<v Speaker 1>made me taking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This lady was always mad because I was </v>

646
00:26:39.701 --> 00:26:39.701
<v Speaker 1>always like 20 minutes late and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

647
00:26:39.701 --> 00:26:39.701
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>

648
00:26:39.701 --> 00:26:43.890
<v Speaker 1>but it took me two and a half hours to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get all the time.</v>

649
00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:47.070
<v Speaker 1>All the time coming from were coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>from new rochelle,</v>

650
00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:49.920
<v Speaker 1>which is like the bronx.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two and a half hours is normal.</v>

651
00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:52.500
<v Speaker 1>You would get on that highway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was one of those.</v>

652
00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:55.470
<v Speaker 1>They built highway so stupid on the east</v>
<v Speaker 1>coast.</v>

653
00:26:55.471 --> 00:26:57.270
<v Speaker 1>They didn't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't get it.</v>

654
00:26:57.271 --> 00:26:59.340
<v Speaker 1>They didn't know there was gonna be that</v>
<v Speaker 1>many people there.</v>

655
00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:02.520
<v Speaker 1>So these highlights are all like fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>three lanes on each side.</v>

656
00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:07.550
<v Speaker 1>Four lanes at the most.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have these giant expansive </v>

657
00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:09.090
<v Speaker 1>four or five style eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine lane highways.</v>

658
00:27:09.091 --> 00:27:10.650
<v Speaker 1>They don't have them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're small,</v>

659
00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:15.240
<v Speaker 1>especially boston,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Massachusetts turnpike.</v>

660
00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:20.300
<v Speaker 1>I go on the turnpike when I go back home</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I can't believe they call this a </v>

661
00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:21.510
<v Speaker 1>turnpike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking two lanes on each side.</v>

662
00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:24.360
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculously small.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like,</v>

663
00:27:24.361 --> 00:27:27.000
<v Speaker 1>it's such a small little ass shitbag </v>
<v Speaker 1>road,</v>

664
00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:29.850
<v Speaker 1>like the way to get to the cape just </v>
<v Speaker 1>like my god.</v>

665
00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:34.850
<v Speaker 1>It's a little tiny ass road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't anticipate that shit at all,</v>

666
00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:38.310
<v Speaker 1>but that's not that long ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

667
00:27:38.311 --> 00:27:40.490

668
00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:41.490
<v Speaker 1>100 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

669
00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:43.170

<v Speaker 1>use the same principle for making a </v>

692
00:28:58.041 --> 00:28:59.130
<v Speaker 1>cell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would it take,</v>

693
00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:02.110
<v Speaker 1>once you sign that steam power model </v>
<v Speaker 1>till you just fuck it,</v>

694
00:29:02.130 --> 00:29:04.860
<v Speaker 1>put into practice in a real car?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eight years today?</v>

695
00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:06.450
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>

696
00:29:06.451 --> 00:29:08.150
<v Speaker 1>But it wouldn't take it off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't.</v>

697
00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:09.890
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't take as many years as it </v>
<v Speaker 1>went back.</v>

698
00:29:09.891 --> 00:29:12.840
<v Speaker 1>Now back then you had to make somebody </v>
<v Speaker 1>accountable.</v>

699
00:29:12.841 --> 00:29:15.510
<v Speaker 1>Something similar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta make your own tools to work on</v>

700
00:29:15.511 --> 00:29:17.800
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know about that.</v>

701
00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:22.890
<v Speaker 1>Can't go to hechinger yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't just fucking go out a </v>

702
00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:26.010
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forgot about that name.</v>

703
00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:29.100
<v Speaker 1>A crazy with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you would have to make a machine and</v>

704
00:29:29.101 --> 00:29:34.101
<v Speaker 1>then make the parts and then make the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking tools to work in the machine </v>

705
00:29:34.101 --> 00:29:36.980
<v Speaker 1>called blacks enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So apparently it was like they got it.</v>

706
00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:39.690
<v Speaker 1>They got their shit together where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

707
00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:40.500
<v Speaker 1>it was like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

708
00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:42.120
<v Speaker 1>the late 1800 seems</v>

709
00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:44.170
<v Speaker 4>like they started really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really rocking it.</v>

710
00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:46.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was.</v>

711
00:29:46.571 --> 00:29:49.450
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought that ford,</v>

712
00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:51.330
<v Speaker 4>Henry Ford invented the car.</v>

713
00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:54.620
<v Speaker 1>We're always taught the first class</v>

714
00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:00.390
<v Speaker 4>manufacture because it says that Germany</v>
<v Speaker 4>was the first,</v>

715
00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:03.090
<v Speaker 4>the first automobile powered by its own </v>
<v Speaker 4>for stroke,</v>

716
00:30:03.610 --> 00:30:07.050
<v Speaker 4>a cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gasoline engine was built in mannheim,</v>

717
00:30:07.051 --> 00:30:09.630
<v Speaker 4>Germany in 18,</v>
<v Speaker 4>85.</v>

718
00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:12.840
<v Speaker 4>Could you imagine how fucking weird it </v>
<v Speaker 4>must have been,</v>

719
00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:17.960
<v Speaker 4>like even thinking about other countries</v>
<v Speaker 4>that are on the other side of the ocean </v>

720
00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:17.960
<v Speaker 4>and 18,</v>
<v Speaker 4>85.</v>

721
00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:20.940
<v Speaker 4>I mean when we think about Germany or we</v>
<v Speaker 4>think about eating england,</v>

722
00:30:20.941 --> 00:30:22.950
<v Speaker 4>at least for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been there.</v>

723
00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:25.770
<v Speaker 4>I've been to both of them a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 4>times and when erica succeeded,</v>

724
00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:29.520
<v Speaker 4>people in england were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know anyone who's even been</v>

725
00:30:29.521 --> 00:30:30.870
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know anyone who.</v>

726
00:30:30.871 --> 00:30:32.370
<v Speaker 4>Nobody knew it because if you went </v>
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

727
00:30:32.371 --> 00:30:33.920
<v Speaker 4>you never went back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

728
00:30:33.930 --> 00:30:36.780
<v Speaker 4>it takes too long.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's months like how much does it take?</v>

<v Speaker 1>but that took a boat here.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

750
00:31:22.450 --> 00:31:27.450

<v Speaker 1>white people and generally easy to pick </v>

751
00:31:27.450 --> 00:31:27.450
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

752
00:31:27.450 --> 00:31:28.400
<v Speaker 1>You should go only after white people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard.</v>

753
00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:31.720
<v Speaker 1>I thought for years of how to get your </v>
<v Speaker 1>whites and I can't think of anything.</v>

754
00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:33.970
<v Speaker 1>There's no angle Because i'm offended as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a race.</v>

755
00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:39.180
<v Speaker 1>What are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would have to be an individual thing </v>

756
00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:39.180
<v Speaker 1>like marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your thoughts,</v>

757
00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:40.870
<v Speaker 1>no flavor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how are you that won't,</v>

758
00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:46.160
<v Speaker 1>that won't get them mad to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at me pointing out that white </v>

759
00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:46.270
<v Speaker 1>people have little dicks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what you're sayIng,</v>

760
00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:48.480
<v Speaker 1>what an angle to do for a sketch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

761
00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:49.750
<v Speaker 1>let's throw it up on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

762
00:31:49.751 --> 00:31:51.860
<v Speaker 1>People will come up with an angle for </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

763
00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.490
<v Speaker 1>but the thing is would have to make the </v>
<v Speaker 1>magic of seeing it like,</v>

764
00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:59.520
<v Speaker 1>like the klan makes black people imagine</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only way it's going to be Megan </v>

765
00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:02.790
<v Speaker 1>White people mad if you make black </v>
<v Speaker 1>people move into the neighborhood and </v>

766
00:32:02.790 --> 00:32:02.790
<v Speaker 1>start partying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

767
00:32:02.790 --> 00:32:06.570
<v Speaker 1>That's what makes it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That won't offend them as a race of </v>

768
00:32:06.570 --> 00:32:06.570
<v Speaker 1>white people and white people see that </v>
<v Speaker 1>at home.</v>

769
00:32:06.570 --> 00:32:06.730
<v Speaker 1>They won't get offended.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

770
00:32:06.790 --> 00:32:08.350
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you're saying is the people in that</v>

771
00:32:08.351 --> 00:32:13.351
<v Speaker 1>neighBorhood will be upset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do racist shit around black people </v>

772
00:32:13.351 --> 00:32:13.900
<v Speaker 1>like were a kkk outfit and they want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>beat your ass.</v>

773
00:32:13.901 --> 00:32:15.760
<v Speaker 1>They're offended,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't do this by the image.</v>

774
00:32:15.761 --> 00:32:17.110
<v Speaker 1>They get upset about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

775
00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:19.330
<v Speaker 1>it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>White people dominated,</v>

776
00:32:19.510 --> 00:32:22.720
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately a lot of white people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was cool to say unfortunately,</v>

777
00:32:22.721 --> 00:32:24.610
<v Speaker 1>but look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to look historically,</v>

778
00:32:24.611 --> 00:32:27.230
<v Speaker 1>I'd way rather be on the team when.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah aNd</v>

779
00:32:27.650 --> 00:32:32.650
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and as far as like giant groups of </v>

780
00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:32.770
<v Speaker 4>people that run shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are the optIons?</v>

781
00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:34.300
<v Speaker 4>Is white people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>black people,</v>

782
00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:37.210
<v Speaker 4>asians and arabs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

783
00:32:37.211 --> 00:32:39.980
<v Speaker 4>Those are the options of giant groups.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People that are running</v>

784
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.580
<v Speaker 1>shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

785
00:32:41.890 --> 00:32:46.890
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the those entire groups and if </v>

786
00:32:46.890 --> 00:32:48.881
<v Speaker 1>you look at all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like if America is the one </v>

787
00:32:48.881 --> 00:32:52.091
<v Speaker 1>that's run by the white people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seems like you can get away with the </v>

788
00:32:52.091 --> 00:32:54.461
<v Speaker 1>most corporate crime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seems like a pretty hard on the </v>

789
00:32:54.461 --> 00:32:57.551
<v Speaker 1>other kind of crime and China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get away with a lot of corporate </v>

790
00:32:57.551 --> 00:32:57.590
<v Speaker 1>crime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bootleg stuff,</v>

791
00:32:57.590 --> 00:33:02.590
<v Speaker 3>just a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so easily because they're humaN.</v>

792
00:33:02.601 --> 00:33:03.560
<v Speaker 3>Racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Camouflaged.</v>

793
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:04.850
<v Speaker 3>Did you hear what they did?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

794
00:33:04.851 --> 00:33:05.200
<v Speaker 3>They had</v>

795
00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:10.230
<v Speaker 1>fake apple stores selling fake apple </v>
<v Speaker 1>products and the employees and the </v>

796
00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:13.060
<v Speaker 1>people that were working there actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought they were working for apple.</v>

797
00:33:13.061 --> 00:33:13.780
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

798
00:33:13.890 --> 00:33:17.240
<v Speaker 3>They didn't learn one and it's actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>not against the law for them to do that,</v>

799
00:33:17.241 --> 00:33:22.241
<v Speaker 3>but they have to get the special permits</v>
<v Speaker 3>and only three of the stores are two of </v>

800
00:33:22.241 --> 00:33:23.040
<v Speaker 3>the stores actually had the permits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other ones didn't.</v>

801
00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:24.460
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that hilarious?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

802
00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:27.650
<v Speaker 1>but if you looked at that like it seems </v>
<v Speaker 1>like China would be waste oppressive,</v>

803
00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:29.690
<v Speaker 1>but then you got to look at it and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well yeah,</v>

804
00:33:29.691 --> 00:33:31.970
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's because there's a billion </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking people over there,</v>

805
00:33:31.971 --> 00:33:36.971
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you've got a copy of the fucking </v>

806
00:33:36.971 --> 00:33:36.971
<v Speaker 1>matrix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

807
00:33:36.971 --> 00:33:39.670
<v Speaker 1>I guess copy it and felt that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>have got other shit to worry about when </v>

<v Speaker 4>fight any mind talking to me about bias.</v>

924
00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:34.390
<v Speaker 4>There's rockland chocolate down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you right now.</v>

925
00:38:34.830 --> 00:38:37.100
<v Speaker 4>How's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hi tiny tiny man.</v>

926
00:38:37.570 --> 00:38:40.240
<v Speaker 4>Just drinking and talking about how to </v>
<v Speaker 4>fight anyway.</v>

927
00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:41.890
<v Speaker 4>He really would.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He would have fought anyone,</v>

928
00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:43.900
<v Speaker 4>anyone in front of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just got his ass.</v>

929
00:38:43.901 --> 00:38:44.410
<v Speaker 4>How the fuck?</v>

930
00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:46.030
<v Speaker 4>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's turn handed to him.</v>

931
00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:49.300
<v Speaker 4>He'll bite You and fucking tried closer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Call your eyes out.</v>

932
00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:51.760
<v Speaker 4>So dreary over there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

933
00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:54.460
<v Speaker 4>I've never eaten at a place that had </v>
<v Speaker 4>worst food.</v>

934
00:38:54.730 --> 00:38:57.550
<v Speaker 4>Northern Ireland,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we had chinese food there that was like,</v>

935
00:38:57.610 --> 00:39:01.180
<v Speaker 4>it was literallY like dogs and cats and </v>
<v Speaker 4>pigeons.</v>

936
00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:04.210
<v Speaker 4>Who was fucking terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was it porridge good?</v>

937
00:39:04.211 --> 00:39:05.810
<v Speaker 4>At least it was there anything that was </v>
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>

938
00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:09.610
<v Speaker 4>You can't fuck up eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I had a lot of eggs there,</v>

939
00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:14.880
<v Speaker 4>but it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it could obviously be just where </v>

940
00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:15.280
<v Speaker 4>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the parts that I went,</v>

941
00:39:15.310 --> 00:39:17.740
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got the worst food ever and we stay at</v>

942
00:39:17.741 --> 00:39:19.630
<v Speaker 4>a nice hotel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Food Is terrible.</v>

943
00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:20.080
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

944
00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:20.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just like,</v>

945
00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:23.440
<v Speaker 4>it was off like you're eating the beef </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're like,</v>

946
00:39:23.441 --> 00:39:25.770
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck is wrong with his beef </v>
<v Speaker 4>tastes?</v>

947
00:39:26.110 --> 00:39:29.500
<v Speaker 4>This is a piece of steak,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it tastes like completely different.</v>

948
00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:34.800
<v Speaker 4>Like in Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their beef is completely different than </v>

949
00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:35.560
<v Speaker 4>american beef and it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very good.</v>

950
00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:37.150
<v Speaker 4>Don't get me wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Australia's fantastic.</v>

951
00:39:37.151 --> 00:39:38.950
<v Speaker 4>Sydney.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been to sydney twice.</v>

952
00:39:38.951 --> 00:39:39.750
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

953
00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:42.820
<v Speaker 4>because I've had free range to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I eat grass fed beef.</v>

954
00:39:42.821 --> 00:39:44.440
<v Speaker 4>That's what most of the time I ain't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

955
00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:48.490
<v Speaker 4>I like corn fed because it's fattier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you get a little bit more fat in the</v>

956
00:39:48.491 --> 00:39:51.910
<v Speaker 4>cooking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this is a flavor to grass fed that I</v>

957
00:39:51.911 --> 00:39:56.911
<v Speaker 4>prefer and it's a healthier animal for </v>
<v Speaker 4>sure because when you're giving them </v>

958
00:39:56.911 --> 00:40:00.370
<v Speaker 4>corn that is completely outside of their</v>
<v Speaker 4>diet and in the natural world,</v>

959
00:40:00.371 --> 00:40:05.371
<v Speaker 4>it's a grain as opposed to a grass so </v>
<v Speaker 4>their bodies get super fat and </v>

960
00:40:05.371 --> 00:40:06.760
<v Speaker 4>disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why they're so delicious.</v>

961
00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:11.940
<v Speaker 4>That grain fed grass fed meat is </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually fat burner really.</v>

962
00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:16.290
<v Speaker 4>Does that makes sense?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The opposite effect on your system makes</v>

963
00:40:16.291 --> 00:40:16.570
<v Speaker 4>sense.</v>

964
00:40:16.570 --> 00:40:20.050
<v Speaker 4>Because we're not supposed to be eating </v>
<v Speaker 4>an animal that's been forced,</v>

965
00:40:20.051 --> 00:40:22.370
<v Speaker 4>fed some fucked up food to keep it fat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

966
00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:26.380
<v Speaker 4>that's a weird thing man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the difference is,</v>

967
00:40:26.410 --> 00:40:28.120
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the food over in Australia,</v>

968
00:40:28.121 --> 00:40:30.730
<v Speaker 4>like the beef was delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The steak was delicious,</v>

969
00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.740
<v Speaker 4>but it was like pink inside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like a piece of pork chop.</v>

970
00:40:36.070 --> 00:40:37.930
<v Speaker 4>It was a completely different shade.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

971
00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:41.770
<v Speaker 4>it was a way lighter shade because like </v>
<v Speaker 4>when I get a medium rare steak,</v>

972
00:40:41.771 --> 00:40:45.670
<v Speaker 4>you cut into it and you see that juicy </v>
<v Speaker 4>red fucking savage flashing.</v>

973
00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:48.670
<v Speaker 4>But meanwhile this was like a pork chop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

974
00:40:48.671 --> 00:40:50.620
<v Speaker 4>this is like white in there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was very good,</v>

975
00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:52.120
<v Speaker 4>but it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is weird.</v>

976
00:40:52.210 --> 00:40:53.380
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>england,</v>

977
00:40:53.410 --> 00:40:58.410
<v Speaker 4>it looked like steak.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looks similar when I was cutting it </v>

978
00:40:58.410 --> 00:40:58.900
<v Speaker 4>open,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it tasted different.</v>

979
00:40:59.110 --> 00:41:00.390
<v Speaker 4>It tasted like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

980
00:41:00.570 --> 00:41:01.840
<v Speaker 4>like it was sick or something.</v>

981
00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:03.250
<v Speaker 4>I just don't put any spice in or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

982
00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:04.170
<v Speaker 4>None in england.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Excuse me.</v>

983
00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:05.870
<v Speaker 4>Northern Ireland.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

984
00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:11.520
<v Speaker 4>I've had some great food in england.</v>
<v Speaker 4>people say that the food in england is </v>

985
00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:14.041
<v Speaker 4>bad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's nothing compared to northern </v>

986
00:41:14.041 --> 00:41:14.041
<v Speaker 4>Ireland.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've had some delicious restaurants that</v>

987
00:41:14.041 --> 00:41:14.710
<v Speaker 4>are going on in england's got some great</v>
<v Speaker 4>places.</v>

988
00:41:15.010 --> 00:41:15.550
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

989
00:41:15.551 --> 00:41:17.920
<v Speaker 4>when you go to a place is different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

990
00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:19.720
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like when you go get breakfast,</v>

991
00:41:19.721 --> 00:41:21.550
<v Speaker 4>like english breakfast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get an english breakfast,</v>

992
00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:23.920
<v Speaker 4>they bring you beans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Crumpets?</v>

993
00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:25.480
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Awesome.</v>

994
00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:30.570
<v Speaker 4>They're pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But english breakfast they give you </v>

995
00:41:30.570 --> 00:41:32.791
<v Speaker 4>beans and and they call bangers bangers </v>
<v Speaker 4>or sausage and like a broiled tomato all</v>

996
00:41:33.741 --> 00:41:34.500
<v Speaker 4>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's always,</v>

997
00:41:36.050 --> 00:41:40.120
<v Speaker 4>I don't get that roiling the tomato,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's super common.</v>

998
00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:44.240
<v Speaker 4>Falling apart is that they're good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Zenko falls apart a little.</v>

999
00:41:44.241 --> 00:41:45.470
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a little cooked,</v>

1000
00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:46.800
<v Speaker 4>but I don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what.</v>

1001
00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:49.130
<v Speaker 4>Just give me a piece of fucking tomato,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tomato.</v>

1002
00:41:49.131 --> 00:41:51.410
<v Speaker 4>Do you have to improve the flavor of </v>
<v Speaker 4>tomato by cooking it?</v>

1003
00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:55.370
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if that's something I started </v>
<v Speaker 4>making zucchini.</v>

1004
00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:57.740
<v Speaker 4>If you grilled zucchini,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it tastes kinda cool.</v>

1005
00:41:57.770 --> 00:41:58.790
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tastes different.</v>

1006
00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:01.160
<v Speaker 4>have you grilled tomatoes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So just not better,</v>

1007
00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:02.840
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1008
00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:03.710
<v Speaker 4>I don't know either.</v>

1009
00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:09.500
<v Speaker 5>I've met a scottish comic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was like a 23 in montreal.</v>

1010
00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:12.290
<v Speaker 5>You couldn't understand a word he said </v>
<v Speaker 5>possible.</v>

1011
00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:17.320
<v Speaker 5>It was like people were trying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like laughing at the idea of his accent </v>

1012
00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:18.140
<v Speaker 5>and then it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we don't understand any of this and it's</v>

1013
00:42:18.141 --> 00:42:21.950
<v Speaker 5>all english.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was amazing to watch.</v>

1014
00:42:22.570 --> 00:42:23.500
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's um,</v>

1015
00:42:23.590 --> 00:42:25.420
<v Speaker 4>it's interesting that the english </v>
<v Speaker 4>language has,</v>

1016
00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:30.760
<v Speaker 4>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you go to all these different parts of </v>

1017
00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:30.760
<v Speaker 4>the globe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1018
00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:35.080
<v Speaker 4>And hear the variations from like </v>
<v Speaker 4>southern Georgia to northern Ireland,</v>

1019
00:42:35.290 --> 00:42:40.290
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you hear the variations of the same </v>

1020
00:42:40.290 --> 00:42:40.290
<v Speaker 4>words and what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1021
00:42:40.290 --> 00:42:43.950
<v Speaker 4>what they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what we use and don't use may really is </v>

1022
00:42:43.950 --> 00:42:43.950
<v Speaker 4>almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a bunch of different languages.</v>

1023
00:42:43.950 --> 00:42:48.871
<v Speaker 4>Like it's getting close,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's getting close to like morphing off </v>

1024
00:42:48.871 --> 00:42:50.470
<v Speaker 4>into its own separate branch if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if people are separate.</v>

1025
00:42:50.830 --> 00:42:52.900
<v Speaker 4>The thing that fucked everything changed</v>
<v Speaker 4>separately.</v>

1026
00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:54.800
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But they're,</v>

1027
00:42:54.850 --> 00:42:56.500
<v Speaker 4>they're connected now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1028
00:42:56.501 --> 00:42:59.590
<v Speaker 4>now it's like people are inexorably </v>
<v Speaker 4>connected with the internet,</v>

1029
00:42:59.591 --> 00:43:01.600
<v Speaker 4>with mass media.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>

1030
00:43:01.650 --> 00:43:06.650
<v Speaker 4>you can hear the way people use those </v>
<v Speaker 4>words all over the world and they're </v>

1031
00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:10.411
<v Speaker 4>going to stay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're going to stay reasonably close </v>

1032
00:43:10.411 --> 00:43:10.411
<v Speaker 4>to the way they are now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if they weren't,</v>

1033
00:43:10.411 --> 00:43:11.720
<v Speaker 4>if people weren't connected,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1034
00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:16.240
<v Speaker 4>there were separated if buy big chunks </v>
<v Speaker 4>of water or something like that.</v>

1035
00:43:16.241 --> 00:43:16.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're there.</v>

1036
00:43:16.890 --> 00:43:19.240
<v Speaker 4>They would probably develop to a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 4>of different languages.</v>

1037
00:43:19.241 --> 00:43:19.410
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1038
00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:25.460
<v Speaker 5>Probably over time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because you think it's a scottish ever </v>

1039
00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:25.460
<v Speaker 5>read?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1040
00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:26.050
<v Speaker 5>a transporting?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1041
00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:27.620
<v Speaker 5>Written in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh really?</v>

1042
00:43:27.930 --> 00:43:29.470
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's written in vernacular.</v>

1043
00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:31.270
<v Speaker 5>It's like you have to like piece </v>
<v Speaker 5>together what they're saying.</v>

1044
00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:36.990
<v Speaker 5>It's like eventually that would sort of </v>
<v Speaker 5>become the written language and then </v>

1045
00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:37.810
<v Speaker 5>eventually certain words that you have </v>
<v Speaker 5>completely different words like the lift</v>

1046
00:43:37.870 --> 00:43:42.870
<v Speaker 5>in england for the elevator.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He would just start using those words </v>

1047
00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:43.660
<v Speaker 5>and it become a different language </v>
<v Speaker 5>though with our numerals or something.</v>

1048
00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:44.920
<v Speaker 4>Some guy was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1049
00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:49.990
<v Speaker 4>there was some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some guy was on the radio the other day </v>

1050
00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:52.191
<v Speaker 4>and he was talking about how diverse the</v>
<v Speaker 4>england is and how many different </v>

1051
00:43:52.191 --> 00:43:52.450
<v Speaker 4>languages are spoken in england.</v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible].</v>

1052
00:43:52.451 --> 00:43:57.451
<v Speaker 4>We were talking about the riots and they</v>
<v Speaker 4>were talking about 300 different </v>

1053
00:43:57.451 --> 00:43:57.451
<v Speaker 4>languages.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I went,</v>

1054
00:43:57.451 --> 00:43:57.520
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>three?</v>

1055
00:43:57.650 --> 00:44:00.020
<v Speaker 4>I didn't even know there were 300 </v>
<v Speaker 4>languages.</v>

1056
00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:05.470
<v Speaker 4>How many?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought there was probably like 30 </v>

1057
00:44:05.470 --> 00:44:05.470
<v Speaker 4>languages.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's like a bunch of indians,</v>

1058
00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:08.870
<v Speaker 4>much different indian languages.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Me and american indian or India,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

1060
00:44:09.770 --> 00:44:11.860

<v Speaker 4>like 30 or 40 minutes.</v>

1061
00:44:11.890 --> 00:44:16.890
<v Speaker 4>Jesus christ.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some of those you might be able to </v>

1062
00:44:16.890 --> 00:44:16.890
<v Speaker 4>understand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if you know,</v>

1063

<v Speaker 4>others like spanish and italian because </v>

<v Speaker 4>A bunch of different ways to talk </v>

1066
00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:24.280
<v Speaker 4>chinese.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought it's just too.</v>

1067
00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:27.920
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was cantonese and mandarin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but isn't there various dialects of each</v>

1068
00:44:27.921 --> 00:44:30.770
<v Speaker 4>one of them?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We are little areas is so pure,</v>

1069
00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:35.800
<v Speaker 4>so person who speaks cantonese can </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand a person who speaks mandarin </v>

1070
00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:35.800
<v Speaker 4>at all or that's a completely different </v>
<v Speaker 4>language,</v>

1071
00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:36.660
<v Speaker 4>but I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1073
00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:40.850
<v Speaker 4>who the fuck came up with language </v>
<v Speaker 4>first?</v>

1074
00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:42.570
<v Speaker 4>We know what the oldest language was.</v>

1075
00:44:42.770 --> 00:44:44.150
<v Speaker 6>Mm,</v>

<v Speaker 4>they think it's the sumerian texts.</v>

1080
00:44:56.190 --> 00:44:57.890
<v Speaker 4>6,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>best.</v>

1081
00:44:57.910 --> 00:44:59.460
<v Speaker 4>The oldest shit we've ever seen written </v>

1083
00:45:04.461 --> 00:45:06.120
<v Speaker 4>thing they found in Turkey over the last</v>
<v Speaker 4>couple of decades,</v>

1084
00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:11.360
<v Speaker 4>they fund this new site and target </v>
<v Speaker 4>called go becky tapley and go go </v>

1085
00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:11.670
<v Speaker 4>beckley,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tempe.</v>

1086
00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:14.850
<v Speaker 4>And it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least 6,000</v>

1087
00:45:14.851 --> 00:45:19.851
<v Speaker 4>years older than summer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's all like really intricately </v>

1088
00:45:20.101 --> 00:45:21.600
<v Speaker 4>carved.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

1089
00:45:21.601 --> 00:45:26.601
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a language that we don't know </v>

1090
00:45:26.601 --> 00:45:26.601
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing.</v>

1091
00:45:26.601 --> 00:45:26.670
<v Speaker 4>This is 6,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>years earlier,</v>

1092
00:45:26.671 --> 00:45:29.400
<v Speaker 4>but they didn't find any language.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just followed that survived.</v>

1093
00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:30.480
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who knows,</v>

1094
00:45:30.481 --> 00:45:32.180
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like when you find a culture that's</v>

1095
00:45:32.190 --> 00:45:34.320
<v Speaker 4>that fucking old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're lucky you're finding anything.</v>

1096
00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:36.810
<v Speaker 4>You know the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the land eats everything.</v>

1097
00:45:36.810 --> 00:45:40.290
<v Speaker 4>If you left a car alone for 16,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>years,</v>

1098
00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:43.020
<v Speaker 4>there's no car left when you come back </v>
<v Speaker 4>to sand.</v>

1099
00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:43.640
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it'll give.</v>

1100
00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:48.740
<v Speaker 4>It'll get absorbed by the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Slowly but surely one little speck at a </v>

1101
00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:48.740
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1102
00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:51.630
<v Speaker 4>if you've ever gone to an old junkyard </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you see a car from like 1940,</v>

1103
00:45:51.690 --> 00:45:54.420
<v Speaker 4>literally it's falling apart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's holes in it,</v>

1104
00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:58.440
<v Speaker 4>it's dissolve,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it'll dissolve the earth.</v>

1105
00:45:58.441 --> 00:46:01.840
<v Speaker 4>What you did for the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the metal just goes back into the ground</v>

1106
00:46:01.841 --> 00:46:04.080
<v Speaker 4>and metal just becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it becomes dirt,</v>

1107
00:46:04.290 --> 00:46:06.270
<v Speaker 4>becomes a part of the soil.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1108
00:46:06.271 --> 00:46:08.220
<v Speaker 4>when we look at a culture that's that </v>
<v Speaker 4>old,</v>

1109
00:46:08.410 --> 00:46:10.740
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you only find rock.</v>

1110
00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:14.820
<v Speaker 4>You're not gonna find anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You might find some carbon from a fire,</v>

1111
00:46:14.970 --> 00:46:19.970
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you might find some arrowheads and shit </v>

1112
00:46:19.970 --> 00:46:19.970
<v Speaker 4>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's got to be hard,</v>

1113
00:46:19.970 --> 00:46:21.690
<v Speaker 4>hard rock or fossils,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1114
00:46:21.691 --> 00:46:24.150
<v Speaker 4>you're going to find like bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like human bodies,</v>

1115
00:46:24.151 --> 00:46:25.890
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>semi fossilized state.</v>

1116
00:46:26.130 --> 00:46:28.740
<v Speaker 4>This is too long ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're noT gonna find any paper.</v>

1117
00:46:28.741 --> 00:46:30.090
<v Speaker 4>If they made paper,</v>
<v Speaker 4>good luck.</v>

1118
00:46:30.091 --> 00:46:35.091
<v Speaker 4>You won't find it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to find any metal </v>

1119
00:46:35.091 --> 00:46:35.091
<v Speaker 4>tools.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those are gone.</v>

1120
00:46:35.091 --> 00:46:35.120
<v Speaker 4>The earth ate those.</v>

1121
00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:40.200
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was something that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>really big the other day about one of </v>

1122
00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:40.200
<v Speaker 3>your theories about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1123
00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:41.140
<v Speaker 3>how civilization started over type </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

1124
00:46:41.470 --> 00:46:43.000
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I met that robot,</v>

1125
00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:45.550
<v Speaker 3>I've not met him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I saw that robot at disneyland,</v>

1126
00:46:45.551 --> 00:46:47.500
<v Speaker 3>the honda robot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the how,</v>

1127
00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:52.840
<v Speaker 3>but I got to see it run and do the stair</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing and I'm looking at it and I'm </v>

1128
00:46:53.291 --> 00:46:55.660
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one day this thing is going to kill me,</v>

1129
00:46:55.661 --> 00:46:56.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and stuff like that,</v>

1130
00:46:56.531 --> 00:47:01.531
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to make robots that and </v>

1131
00:47:01.531 --> 00:47:01.531
<v Speaker 3>it's going to turn on you and stuff like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1132
00:47:01.531 --> 00:47:03.010
<v Speaker 3>And what if like the robots kill the </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole entire human race and then,</v>

1133
00:47:03.011 --> 00:47:08.011
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a virus or something like that </v>

1134
00:47:08.011 --> 00:47:08.011
<v Speaker 3>destroys all the robots and kills all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the robots.</v>

1135
00:47:08.011 --> 00:47:09.370
<v Speaker 3>And in a thousand years later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing,</v>

1136
00:47:09.371 --> 00:47:10.390
<v Speaker 3>all the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1137
00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:13.510
<v Speaker 3>robots turned the sand because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>disintegrate.</v>

1138
00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:18.280
<v Speaker 3>And then there's two people like humans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like hiding in a cave somewhere,</v>

1139
00:47:18.281 --> 00:47:23.281
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>living or the dead bodies and he's </v>

1140
00:47:23.281 --> 00:47:25.560
<v Speaker 3>smoking crack and then they make a kid </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're like jesus and stuff like </v>

1141
00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:25.780
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they build the whole race again.</v>

1142
00:47:25.870 --> 00:47:30.870
<v Speaker 3>But they're so fucked up on crap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's stupid because they were like just </v>

1143
00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:32.500
<v Speaker 3>living a cave the whole time that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the human race starts over again,</v>

1144
00:47:32.650 --> 00:47:37.650
<v Speaker 3>we.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we try to build robots again </v>

1145
00:47:37.650 --> 00:47:37.870
<v Speaker 3>and then they kill us off again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And crack addicts and the caves.</v>

1146
00:47:38.050 --> 00:47:39.300
<v Speaker 3>That's what I was thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that disneyland,</v>

1147
00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:41.080
<v Speaker 3>that's the entire</v>

1148
00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:46.140
<v Speaker 4>plot of battlestar galactica.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The cylons take over its end.</v>

1149
00:47:46.591 --> 00:47:48.480
<v Speaker 4>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a very possible plot.</v>

1150
00:47:48.750 --> 00:47:53.750
<v Speaker 4>The idea that we can make intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 4>life and we're super close to doing </v>

1151
00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:55.410
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're super close to having some sort of</v>

1152
00:47:55.710 --> 00:48:00.710
<v Speaker 4>an artificial intelligence that you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>communicate with that actually even </v>

1153
00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:04.011
<v Speaker 4>developed some motions they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>have like an emotional response is </v>

1154
00:48:04.011 --> 00:48:04.950
<v Speaker 4>programmed into these fucking things and</v>
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

1155
00:48:05.070 --> 00:48:10.070
<v Speaker 4>for us to be arrogantly assuming that </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's never going to be a problem </v>

1156
00:48:10.070 --> 00:48:10.920
<v Speaker 4>because they're not really live there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not really,</v>

1157
00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:15.420
<v Speaker 4>but if we create a system that responds </v>
<v Speaker 4>as if it was alive,</v>

1158
00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:18.420
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if that system has self realization,</v>

1159
00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:23.440
<v Speaker 4>now that system become sentience and </v>
<v Speaker 4>realizes it has to protect itself and </v>

1160
00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:27.780
<v Speaker 4>then it defends itself against another </v>
<v Speaker 4>system that is just as alive as a virus.</v>

1161
00:48:27.781 --> 00:48:30.750
<v Speaker 4>It's just as alive as an animal that </v>
<v Speaker 4>wants to eat you.</v>

1162
00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:33.330
<v Speaker 4>It's just as alive as anything that's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>live band.</v>

1163
00:48:33.460 --> 00:48:35.340
<v Speaker 4>You've created something that exists </v>
<v Speaker 4>right now.</v>

1164
00:48:35.490 --> 00:48:40.490
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it may not have cells in bone as you </v>

1165
00:48:40.490 --> 00:48:43.911
<v Speaker 4>think of life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's responding and moving and </v>

1166
00:48:43.911 --> 00:48:45.840
<v Speaker 4>interacting and it's intelligent and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you've actually made this fucking thing,</v>

1167
00:48:45.841 --> 00:48:47.610
<v Speaker 4>a brain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've built this thing,</v>

1168
00:48:47.611 --> 00:48:49.650
<v Speaker 4>the ability to interact with other </v>
<v Speaker 4>brains,</v>

1169
00:48:49.651 --> 00:48:54.651
<v Speaker 4>other technologically created brains,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you've got a whole network of </v>

1170
00:48:54.651 --> 00:48:59.271
<v Speaker 4>beings,</v>
<v Speaker 4>beings that have it within their best </v>

1171
00:48:59.271 --> 00:49:01.500
<v Speaker 4>interest to keep you dead and I'm alive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's all super duper possible.</v>

1172
00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:06.740
<v Speaker 4>It just seems so foreign to us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seems preposterous because our lives,</v>

1173
00:49:06.991 --> 00:49:11.991
<v Speaker 4>our whole lives.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The way we have looked at machines is </v>

1174
00:49:11.991 --> 00:49:11.991
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is some shit people made.</v>

1175
00:49:11.991 --> 00:49:13.620
<v Speaker 4>We have full control of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have full.</v>

1176
00:49:13.630 --> 00:49:14.300
<v Speaker 4>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're out.</v>

1177
00:49:14.370 --> 00:49:19.370
<v Speaker 4>We're completely arrogant about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have full control over the stuff we </v>

1178
00:49:19.370 --> 00:49:19.370
<v Speaker 4>make.</v>

1179
00:49:19.370 --> 00:49:23.380
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever seen that robot run as it </v>
<v Speaker 3>leaves the ground for us?</v>

1180
00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:24.810
<v Speaker 3>Just like a human.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you run,</v>

1181
00:49:24.811 --> 00:49:29.811
<v Speaker 3>you actually there's a point where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're both of your feet are off the </v>

1182
00:49:29.811 --> 00:49:29.811
<v Speaker 3>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does the same thing.</v>

1183
00:49:29.811 --> 00:49:30.420
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was amazing.</v>

1184
00:49:30.620 --> 00:49:32.420
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing and it's just the </v>
<v Speaker 4>beginning.</v>

1185
00:49:32.530 --> 00:49:34.280
<v Speaker 4>It's just the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like I,</v>

1186
00:49:34.281 --> 00:49:36.050
<v Speaker 4>robot I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>robot is going to be legit,</v>

1187
00:49:36.051 --> 00:49:41.051
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're really going to have a robot </v>

1188
00:49:41.051 --> 00:49:41.390
<v Speaker 4>that as is as functional as a human </v>
<v Speaker 4>body.</v>

1189
00:49:41.391 --> 00:49:46.391
<v Speaker 4>It's gonna move like a human body,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's going to be metal and </v>

1190
00:49:46.391 --> 00:49:46.391
<v Speaker 4>replaceable and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's gonna.</v>

1191
00:49:46.391 --> 00:49:49.130
<v Speaker 4>It's gonna have artificial tissue that </v>
<v Speaker 4>won't break or rip or tear,</v>

1192
00:49:49.131 --> 00:49:51.890
<v Speaker 4>but it'll look like human tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be incredible.</v>

1193
00:49:52.010 --> 00:49:57.010
<v Speaker 4>It's just a matter of time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you look at 1800 and what people had </v>

1194
00:49:57.010 --> 00:50:01.931
<v Speaker 4>in 1980 and 1900 and the beginning of </v>
<v Speaker 4>this century in 2000 and then compare it</v>

1195
00:50:02.751 --> 00:50:03.480
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1196
00:50:03.530 --> 00:50:05.260
<v Speaker 4>a thousand years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1197
00:50:05.570 --> 00:50:10.220
<v Speaker 4>there's obviously been some radical </v>
<v Speaker 4>changes in 1900 to 2000 to 2011.</v>

1198
00:50:10.310 --> 00:50:13.880
<v Speaker 4>There's radical radical changes and </v>
<v Speaker 4>those radical changes.</v>

1199
00:50:13.881 --> 00:50:18.881
<v Speaker 4>You took the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the cream of the crop shit that we have </v>

1200
00:50:18.881 --> 00:50:18.930
<v Speaker 4>today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a fucking helicopter and uh,</v>

1201
00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:22.220
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nine slash 11 turbo and you brought them</v>

1202
00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:23.550
<v Speaker 4>to 1600.</v>

1203
00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:26.330
<v Speaker 4>There's no way of leonardo davinci sat </v>
<v Speaker 4>and looked at that.</v>

1204
00:50:26.331 --> 00:50:28.280
<v Speaker 4>He could have ever a nine slash 11 </v>
<v Speaker 4>turbo.</v>

1205
00:50:28.590 --> 00:50:29.840
<v Speaker 4>He would get in that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>it'd be like,</v>

1206
00:50:29.841 --> 00:50:31.880
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like wow.</v>

1207
00:50:31.881 --> 00:50:36.881
<v Speaker 4>Really this is fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like think of someone who like davinci </v>

1208
00:50:36.881 --> 00:50:38.480
<v Speaker 4>invented so many crazy things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1209
00:50:38.481 --> 00:50:43.481
<v Speaker 4>is had pat drawings for flying machines </v>
<v Speaker 4>and all sorts of different things that </v>

1210
00:50:43.481 --> 00:50:47.471
<v Speaker 4>he created.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you showed him what actually </v>

1211
00:50:47.471 --> 00:50:48.440
<v Speaker 4>occurred in our lifetime,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which we completely take for granted,</v>

1212
00:50:48.441 --> 00:50:51.860
<v Speaker 4>going towards it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like space 1999 shit.</v>

1213
00:50:51.861 --> 00:50:53.240
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like science fiction.</v>

1214
00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:58.480
<v Speaker 4>So for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if these guys are making robots like </v>

1215
00:50:58.480 --> 00:50:58.670
<v Speaker 4>this honda robot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is amazing,</v>

1216
00:50:58.850 --> 00:51:01.200
<v Speaker 4>in 2011,</v>
<v Speaker 4>2000,</v>

1217
00:51:01.540 --> 00:51:04.070
<v Speaker 4>211,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck man,</v>

1218
00:51:04.071 --> 00:51:08.300
<v Speaker 4>it is going to be like blade runner as </v>
<v Speaker 4>long as I'm the you might not be dead.</v>

1219
00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:12.050
<v Speaker 4>That's the crazy thing with the science </v>
<v Speaker 4>and technology the way it is today,</v>

1220
00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:13.340
<v Speaker 4>you might not be dead at all.</v>

1221
00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:17.870
<v Speaker 4>There might be a renewed pill where you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can take within our lifetime that renews</v>

1222
00:51:17.871 --> 00:51:21.770
<v Speaker 4>your cells and reprograms your dna to </v>
<v Speaker 4>behave as if it's young.</v>

1223
00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:26.800
<v Speaker 4>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're going to watch someone have a </v>

1224
00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:26.800
<v Speaker 4>vaccine for aging at some point so they </v>
<v Speaker 4>haven't had it.</v>

1225
00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:31.281
<v Speaker 4>You have to take it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're not really babies and people </v>

1226
00:51:31.281 --> 00:51:31.281
<v Speaker 4>haven't got the vaccine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are all gonna die.</v>

1227
00:51:31.281 --> 00:51:33.620
<v Speaker 4>Maybe that's a possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It locks them all go.</v>

1228
00:51:33.710 --> 00:51:37.040
<v Speaker 4>More likely they'll manipulate the fact </v>
<v Speaker 4>that the cells recreate themselves every</v>

1229
00:51:37.041 --> 00:51:42.041
<v Speaker 4>seven years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything except the neurons is </v>

1230
00:51:42.041 --> 00:51:44.681
<v Speaker 4>completely replaced every seven years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what they'll do is they'll reprogram </v>

1231
00:51:44.681 --> 00:51:49.001
<v Speaker 4>all these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all these cells to come back fresh and </v>

1232
00:51:49.001 --> 00:51:52.421
<v Speaker 4>young and that's what they'll do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So over a seven year period and you'll </v>

1233
00:51:52.421 --> 00:51:55.541
<v Speaker 4>take this shit and over seven year </v>
<v Speaker 4>period you'll go from being some old </v>

1234
00:51:55.541 --> 00:51:58.990
<v Speaker 4>lady to some hot young 20 year old bitch</v>
<v Speaker 4>him or if he just.</v>

1235
00:51:59.030 --> 00:52:01.160
<v Speaker 4>That'd be cool if he or if he just </v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't get older,</v>

1236
00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:06.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like whatever time you took that </v>

1237
00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:06.470
<v Speaker 4>probably because I doubt you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>be the beginning.</v>

1238
00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:07.640
<v Speaker 4>Oh it will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It will.</v>

1239
00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:08.960
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no question about it.</v>

1240
00:52:08.961 --> 00:52:10.310
<v Speaker 4>If you will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just think what I said,</v>

1241
00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:12.320
<v Speaker 4>if you're a tissue could recreate </v>
<v Speaker 4>itself.</v>

1242
00:52:12.350 --> 00:52:17.350
<v Speaker 4>The thing is you got to get it to </v>
<v Speaker 4>recreate itself in a state that's not </v>

1243
00:52:17.350 --> 00:52:17.350
<v Speaker 4>damaged like scars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1244
00:52:17.350 --> 00:52:18.230
<v Speaker 4>I'll give you think about if you have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>scar.</v>

1245
00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:19.670
<v Speaker 4>That scar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a scar,</v>

1246
00:52:19.671 --> 00:52:22.190
<v Speaker 4>a big one on my finger that I got when I</v>
<v Speaker 4>was like nine.</v>

1247
00:52:22.420 --> 00:52:24.800
<v Speaker 4>So that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that scar is still here when I'm 44.</v>

1248
00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:27.320
<v Speaker 4>Why is it still here?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why is it still here?</v>

1249
00:52:27.321 --> 00:52:30.380
<v Speaker 4>If everything's recreating because it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>recreating in damaged state.</v>

1250
00:52:30.590 --> 00:52:34.820
<v Speaker 4>When you would have to get your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your cells to not recreate in a state of</v>

1251
00:52:34.821 --> 00:52:36.460
<v Speaker 4>an old person who's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1252
00:52:36.830 --> 00:52:38.630
<v Speaker 4>fucking engines misfiring.</v>

1253
00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:43.400
<v Speaker 4>You want to get into a mature person of </v>
<v Speaker 4>around 25 years of age.</v>

1254
00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:44.540
<v Speaker 4>Physically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what you want.</v>

1255
00:52:44.541 --> 00:52:49.541
<v Speaker 4>I think it's more like they're just </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to take your head off robocop </v>

1256
00:52:49.541 --> 00:52:51.860
<v Speaker 4>style and put you on a robocop body and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then you're going to find a way to like </v>

1257
00:52:51.860 --> 00:52:52.210
<v Speaker 4>highs your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh your shit,</v>

1258
00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:55.070
<v Speaker 4>and I don't think it will be a </v>
<v Speaker 4>biological solution of against to that.</v>

1259
00:52:55.071 --> 00:53:00.071
<v Speaker 4>I think it'll be a matter of recreating </v>
<v Speaker 4>your consciousness in a form of like a </v>

1260
00:53:00.071 --> 00:53:00.520
<v Speaker 4>computer code.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1261
00:53:00.521 --> 00:53:02.690
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if an operating system works for the mac</v>

1262
00:53:02.691 --> 00:53:04.810
<v Speaker 4>and operating system works for the pc,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

1263
00:53:04.830 --> 00:53:07.080
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck is a human being?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you know?</v>

1264
00:53:07.090 --> 00:53:12.090
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is the driving mechanism behind </v>

1265
00:53:12.090 --> 00:53:16.360
<v Speaker 4>what makes a person want to eat and fuck</v>
<v Speaker 4>and and be successful and be curious and</v>

1266
00:53:17.580 --> 00:53:19.580
<v Speaker 4>what it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck is under the surface?</v>

1267
00:53:19.580 --> 00:53:22.910
<v Speaker 4>Is it just a bunch of ones and zeros,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if it's not,</v>

1268
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:27.300
<v Speaker 4>is it possible to exactly it with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>bunch of ones and zeros?</v>

1269
00:53:27.420 --> 00:53:32.420
<v Speaker 4>That's the real question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it possible to take a human being's </v>

1270
00:53:32.420 --> 00:53:35.481
<v Speaker 4>consciousness and completely recreated </v>
<v Speaker 4>to the point where all of a sudden </v>

1271
00:53:35.481 --> 00:53:38.280
<v Speaker 4>you're switched on and you know you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>switched on in,</v>

1272
00:53:38.281 --> 00:53:43.281
<v Speaker 4>in this body,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you wake up one day and you don't </v>

1273
00:53:43.281 --> 00:53:45.921
<v Speaker 4>even fucking know that you are a </v>
<v Speaker 4>computer code and a machine and that </v>

1274
00:53:45.921 --> 00:53:49.470
<v Speaker 4>your entire life is absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 4>completely 100 percent artificial.</v>

1275
00:53:49.740 --> 00:53:53.130
<v Speaker 4>It's just being fed to thIs computer </v>
<v Speaker 4>code through this,</v>

1276
00:53:53.131 --> 00:53:55.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this program that someone has created.</v>

1277
00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:56.640
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is all,</v>

1278
00:53:56.850 --> 00:54:01.110
<v Speaker 4>that's not like completely ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not like is even as ridiculous as</v>

1279
00:54:01.111 --> 00:54:03.420
<v Speaker 4>time travel and that's not ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1280
00:54:03.750 --> 00:54:08.750
<v Speaker 4>I mean the elder,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's some scientists that believe </v>

1281
00:54:08.750 --> 00:54:08.750
<v Speaker 4>that you can never bypass the speed of </v>
<v Speaker 4>light,</v>

1282
00:54:08.750 --> 00:54:11.820
<v Speaker 4>so time travel will be impossible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think they just say that for now.</v>

1283
00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:16.940
<v Speaker 4>I think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's nothIng that's going to </v>

1284
00:54:16.940 --> 00:54:19.131
<v Speaker 4>eventually not be possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think It'll just be a matter of how </v>

1285
00:54:19.131 --> 00:54:22.401
<v Speaker 4>much power can read we generate in order</v>
<v Speaker 4>to manipulate our surroundings to make </v>

1286
00:54:22.401 --> 00:54:23.730
<v Speaker 4>everything possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a matter of time.</v>

1287
00:54:23.910 --> 00:54:24.600
<v Speaker 4>It,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>

1288
00:54:24.601 --> 00:54:27.240
<v Speaker 4>you know what's impossible today was </v>
<v Speaker 4>not.</v>

1289
00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:27.680
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

1290
00:54:27.780 --> 00:54:30.420
<v Speaker 4>what was impossible 200 years ago is not</v>
<v Speaker 4>impossible today,</v>

1291
00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:33.000
<v Speaker 4>so when you hear scientists saying that </v>
<v Speaker 4>this is impossible,</v>

1292
00:54:33.210 --> 00:54:36.330
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't mean it's impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just means as far as what we know now</v>

1293
00:54:36.331 --> 00:54:38.460
<v Speaker 4>and we don't know shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1294
00:54:38.461 --> 00:54:41.250
<v Speaker 4>we know a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean we're brilliant and comparison to</v>

1295
00:54:41.251 --> 00:54:46.251
<v Speaker 4>caveman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but in comparison to understanding just </v>

1296
00:54:46.251 --> 00:54:46.310
<v Speaker 4>the very nature of the universe and when</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1297
00:54:46.330 --> 00:54:51.330
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>subatomic particles and they lose all </v>

1298
00:54:51.330 --> 00:54:53.520
<v Speaker 4>fucking rules,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go out the window when you go subatomic,</v>

1299
00:54:53.770 --> 00:54:56.010
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have things called we're a particle</v>

1300
00:54:56.011 --> 00:55:01.011
<v Speaker 4>can be in a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a super state where it's in a state </v>

1301
00:55:01.011 --> 00:55:01.980
<v Speaker 4>of moving and it's still at the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

1302
00:55:02.550 --> 00:55:07.550
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck does that even mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the idea that you can look at </v>

1303
00:55:07.550 --> 00:55:11.421
<v Speaker 4>something and as you're looking at it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you change the behavior of it and then </v>

1304
00:55:11.421 --> 00:55:16.101
<v Speaker 4>you can watch an event and the observer </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually changes the actual atoms that </v>

1305
00:55:16.820 --> 00:55:17.280
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that are,</v>

1306
00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:20.220
<v Speaker 4>that are moving in the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How is that possible?</v>

1307
00:55:20.670 --> 00:55:21.720
<v Speaker 4>We don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't know.</v>

1308
00:55:22.190 --> 00:55:25.500
<v Speaker 4>so to say that people know a lot and we </v>
<v Speaker 4>know a lot for people,</v>

1309
00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:30.800
<v Speaker 4>we know a lot for people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's some shit that we don't </v>

1310
00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:33.501
<v Speaker 4>understand at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't even know why the </v>

1311
00:55:33.501 --> 00:55:35.751
<v Speaker 4>universities together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't know why it doesn't just fly </v>

1312
00:55:35.751 --> 00:55:35.751
<v Speaker 4>apart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1313
00:55:35.751 --> 00:55:36.900
<v Speaker 4>this dark matter thing is like they </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't.</v>

1314
00:55:36.930 --> 00:55:39.940
<v Speaker 4>They don't know what the fuck that is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's just guessing.</v>

1315
00:55:39.941 --> 00:55:41.440
<v Speaker 4>It's probably just with vinegar or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>

1316
00:55:41.550 --> 00:55:44.910
<v Speaker 4>They've realized it is probably douche </v>
<v Speaker 4>vinegar.</v>

1317
00:55:45.210 --> 00:55:46.140
<v Speaker 4>You know what they figured out?</v>

1318
00:55:46.140 --> 00:55:51.140
<v Speaker 4>They figured out that there's some sort </v>
<v Speaker 4>of an anti matter like layer to the van </v>

1319
00:55:51.140 --> 00:55:55.761
<v Speaker 4>allen radiation belts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that there's a layer of anti-matter out </v>

1320
00:55:55.761 --> 00:56:00.081
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know what the fuck that </v>

1321
00:56:00.081 --> 00:56:00.300
<v Speaker 4>means,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's incredible that there's some,</v>

1322
00:56:00.510 --> 00:56:03.630
<v Speaker 4>some shit that they've been talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about using for weapons forever.</v>

1323
00:56:03.690 --> 00:56:08.690
<v Speaker 4>They've been talking about anti-matter </v>
<v Speaker 4>weapons forever because if you could </v>

1324
00:56:08.690 --> 00:56:09.360
<v Speaker 4>conceivably create an anti weapon </v>
<v Speaker 4>anti-matter weapon,</v>

1325
00:56:09.361 --> 00:56:13.580
<v Speaker 4>it would be just as big of a leap as </v>
<v Speaker 4>nuclear weapons were two arrows.</v>

1326
00:56:13.980 --> 00:56:15.660
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Things just fucking go.</v>

1327
00:56:15.670 --> 00:56:18.840
<v Speaker 4>Bye bye.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just cool to imagine.</v>

1328
00:56:19.740 --> 00:56:24.740
<v Speaker 4>Imagine if we went to Afghanistan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they tried anti-matter weapons on </v>

1329
00:56:24.740 --> 00:56:27.760
<v Speaker 4>Afghanistan and we went there in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Afghanistan was like a bowl,</v>

1330
00:56:27.850 --> 00:56:32.850
<v Speaker 4>a ceramic bowl like white and shiny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there was literally nothing else </v>

1331
00:56:33.071 --> 00:56:34.780
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like the whole thing,</v>

1332
00:56:34.781 --> 00:56:39.781
<v Speaker 4>which is white and shiny like ceramic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not outside the realm of </v>

1333
00:56:39.781 --> 00:56:41.830
<v Speaker 4>possibility because we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we already.</v>

1334
00:56:41.890 --> 00:56:42.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1335
00:56:42.611 --> 00:56:44.290
<v Speaker 4>we did that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everyone is.</v>

1336
00:56:44.291 --> 00:56:47.260
<v Speaker 4>When I realized that I talked to tony,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was like everyone's like,</v>

1337
00:56:47.261 --> 00:56:48.730
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can't trust the russians with nuclear</v>

1338
00:56:48.731 --> 00:56:50.080
<v Speaker 4>weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can't trust the chinese.</v>

1339
00:56:50.450 --> 00:56:55.450
<v Speaker 4>The koreans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like we're the only ones that have </v>

1340
00:56:55.450 --> 00:56:55.450
<v Speaker 4>set.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Set them off.</v>

1341
00:56:55.450 --> 00:56:55.630
<v Speaker 4>We're the only ones that we did it </v>
<v Speaker 4>twice.</v>

1342
00:56:55.810 --> 00:57:00.810
<v Speaker 4>Oh no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Russians have detonated them for </v>

1343
00:57:00.810 --> 00:57:00.810
<v Speaker 4>practice against people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1344
00:57:00.810 --> 00:57:01.930
<v Speaker 4>We're the only ones that people and </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're like,</v>

1345
00:57:01.931 --> 00:57:02.790
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can't trust them with them.</v>

1346
00:57:02.791 --> 00:57:07.791
<v Speaker 4>We can't trust us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're the ones who can trust as us and </v>

1347
00:57:07.791 --> 00:57:09.880
<v Speaker 4>where these are people that existed a </v>
<v Speaker 4>long time ago.</v>

1348
00:57:09.940 --> 00:57:12.020
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea that we're at with those douche</v>

1349
00:57:12.021 --> 00:57:14.180
<v Speaker 4>bags,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do shit.</v>

1350
00:57:14.430 --> 00:57:15.910
<v Speaker 4>They didn't just blow up zillions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>the.</v>

1351
00:57:15.970 --> 00:57:20.970
<v Speaker 4>The word is that the japanese were </v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to surrender for a long time and </v>

1352
00:57:20.970 --> 00:57:21.430
<v Speaker 4>he said no because he wanted to test it.</v>

1353
00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:23.500
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they wanted to fucking do it.</v>

1354
00:57:23.950 --> 00:57:25.920
<v Speaker 4>It was not really a task.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They wanted a letter by.</v>

1355
00:57:25.950 --> 00:57:27.340
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's up twice.</v>

1356
00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:32.520
<v Speaker 4>Drop bombs and car alarms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The idea that you're going to take this </v>

1357
00:57:33.911 --> 00:57:38.500
<v Speaker 4>fucking thing that harnesses the power </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the sun and you're just gonna drop it</v>

1358
00:57:38.501 --> 00:57:40.090
<v Speaker 4>on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some people you don't even know and it's</v>

1359
00:57:40.091 --> 00:57:42.120
<v Speaker 4>okay because we're at war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is like,</v>

1360
00:57:42.510 --> 00:57:44.500
<v Speaker 4>it's not a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These are soldiers.</v>

1361
00:57:44.530 --> 00:57:46.810
<v Speaker 4>These are just some people going about </v>
<v Speaker 4>their business.</v>

1362
00:57:46.811 --> 00:57:51.811
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People are politics and then all of a </v>

1363
00:57:51.811 --> 00:57:52.300
<v Speaker 4>sudden they're just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're obliterated.</v>

1364
00:57:52.301 --> 00:57:55.270
<v Speaker 4>They never were any crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Didn't even know jet engines back there.</v>

1365
00:57:55.271 --> 00:57:56.680
<v Speaker 4>They did their propeller plane</v>

1366
00:57:58.890 --> 00:58:03.890
<v Speaker 4>and they dropped it out of this </v>
<v Speaker 4>propeller plane and then had to do a </v>

1367
00:58:03.890 --> 00:58:04.470
<v Speaker 4>three 60 or one eight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>8 million fucking get out of there.</v>

1368
00:58:04.740 --> 00:58:07.800
<v Speaker 4>Is that what they are?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do follow like physics bumped follows?</v>

1369
00:58:08.060 --> 00:58:13.060
<v Speaker 4>Which?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The planning how high up when they let </v>

1370
00:58:13.060 --> 00:58:13.060
<v Speaker 4>it go?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1371
00:58:13.060 --> 00:58:13.530
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have video footage of that,</v>

1372
00:58:14.010 --> 00:58:17.340
<v Speaker 4>of them doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They must've got fucked up by radiation.</v>

1373
00:58:17.341 --> 00:58:18.420
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably right.</v>

1374
00:58:19.060 --> 00:58:24.060
<v Speaker 4>Probably hit it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fucking went to so many people that got </v>

00:58:28.951 --> 00:58:33.951
<v Speaker 4>the videos of guys running towards the </v>

<v Speaker 4>the bomb.</v>

<v Speaker 4>vapid.</v>

1398
00:59:16.100 --> 00:59:21.020
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing how many people sponsor her</v>
<v Speaker 3>or how many to credit her face is on.</v>

1399
00:59:21.410 --> 00:59:24.290
<v Speaker 3>if you walked through jc penny's or </v>
<v Speaker 3>macy's or whatever it is,</v>

1400
00:59:24.291 --> 00:59:29.291
<v Speaker 3>you'll see her face a million times for </v>
<v Speaker 3>a million different products and </v>

1401
00:59:29.291 --> 00:59:29.291
<v Speaker 3>magazines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1402
00:59:29.291 --> 00:59:29.291
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1403
00:59:29.291 --> 00:59:30.200
<v Speaker 4>Every fucking magazine has her face on </v>
<v Speaker 4>the cover.</v>

1404
00:59:30.201 --> 00:59:32.180
<v Speaker 4>It's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The girls making bank,</v>

1405
00:59:32.300 --> 00:59:34.460
<v Speaker 4>you can't hate her for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't hate it for any of it.</v>

1406
00:59:34.461 --> 00:59:35.840
<v Speaker 4>I don't hate her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's just so dumb.</v>

1407
00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:39.810
<v Speaker 4>It's so amazing that we have fixated on </v>
<v Speaker 4>this and you know,</v>

1408
00:59:39.830 --> 00:59:42.260
<v Speaker 4>she has a very pretty face.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't get me wrong,</v>

1409
00:59:42.380 --> 00:59:47.380
<v Speaker 4>but it's always getting worked on like </v>
<v Speaker 4>every now and then it'll get all puffy </v>

1410
00:59:47.380 --> 00:59:50.741
<v Speaker 4>and shit because she's getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>injections and there's all these before </v>

1411
00:59:50.741 --> 00:59:50.741
<v Speaker 4>and after pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It does look good,</v>

1412
00:59:50.741 --> 00:59:52.220
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I'm saying?</v>

1413
00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:55.520
<v Speaker 4>It's like there's certain girls that </v>
<v Speaker 4>just looked like,</v>

1414
00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:59.720
<v Speaker 4>like angelina jolie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she has this face where like,</v>

1415
00:59:59.721 --> 01:00:02.480
<v Speaker 4>especially when she was young,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you just look at eagle.</v>

1416
01:00:02.481 --> 01:00:05.390
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is a perfect symmetrical face.</v>

1417
01:00:05.570 --> 01:00:08.810
<v Speaker 4>Like I can understand that face being </v>
<v Speaker 4>everywhere and this girl,</v>

1418
01:00:08.811 --> 01:00:10.480
<v Speaker 4>kim kardashians,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's pretty and she's,</v>

1419
01:00:10.550 --> 01:00:15.550
<v Speaker 4>she's hot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's got some big titties and ass and </v>

1420
01:00:15.550 --> 01:00:15.550
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>

1421
01:00:15.550 --> 01:00:18.250
<v Speaker 4>It's all good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not good enough to be focusing </v>

1422
01:00:18.250 --> 01:00:18.590
<v Speaker 4>so much time on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not that.</v>

1423
01:00:18.710 --> 01:00:21.860
<v Speaker 4>It's like people are addicted to her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's cigarettes,</v>

1424
01:00:21.980 --> 01:00:23.660
<v Speaker 4>so cigarettes aren't that good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1425
01:00:23.661 --> 01:00:25.750
<v Speaker 4>you smoke one in the beginning we've </v>
<v Speaker 4>never smoked a cigarette,</v>

1426
01:00:25.770 --> 01:00:30.770
<v Speaker 4>like why would I keep doing this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But after awhile you get addicted to it </v>

1427
01:00:30.770 --> 01:00:33.731
<v Speaker 4>and it becomes something you're used to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now it's like these magazines are </v>

1428
01:00:33.731 --> 01:00:34.130
<v Speaker 4>addicted to putting kim kardashian </v>
<v Speaker 4>everywhere.</v>

1429
01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:37.310
<v Speaker 4>It's like you're making a big deal out </v>
<v Speaker 4>of absolutely nothing.</v>

1430
01:00:37.311 --> 01:00:39.350
<v Speaker 4>She's just a person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not bad.</v>

1431
01:00:39.351 --> 01:00:41.390
<v Speaker 4>Not hating her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She is the girl out there,</v>

1432
01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:46.400
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting her is by being in a show that </v>

1433
01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:49.241
<v Speaker 4>follows her around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>BuT once you start following someone </v>

1434
01:00:49.241 --> 01:00:49.610
<v Speaker 4>around and you start tuning into that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

1435
01:00:49.730 --> 01:00:50.960
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's tricky.</v>

1436
01:00:50.961 --> 01:00:52.530
<v Speaker 4>It is like addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They become a.</v>

1437
01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:55.160
<v Speaker 4>It's like you get programmed with </v>
<v Speaker 4>wanting to know,</v>

1438
01:00:55.161 --> 01:00:56.660
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a conflict going on with her and</v>

1439
01:00:56.661 --> 01:01:01.661
<v Speaker 4>her sister's boyfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder how they're going to resolve </v>

1440
01:01:01.661 --> 01:01:01.661
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want to watch them.</v>

1441
01:01:01.661 --> 01:01:01.730
<v Speaker 4>You just can't help it.</v>

1442
01:01:02.210 --> 01:01:05.990
<v Speaker 3>She just tried to sue a old navy because</v>
<v Speaker 3>a friend of ours,</v>

1443
01:01:05.991 --> 01:01:06.930
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are our friend.</v>

1444
01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:08.830
<v Speaker 3>Mine is melissa mala narrow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1445
01:01:09.830 --> 01:01:13.850
<v Speaker 3>nor was his friends that have a breeze </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't think you ever met her.</v>

1446
01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:16.580
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she uh,</v>

1447
01:01:16.610 --> 01:01:20.030
<v Speaker 3>was on an old navy commercial and she's </v>
<v Speaker 3>singing and dancing.</v>

1448
01:01:20.031 --> 01:01:22.600
<v Speaker 3>It was a commercial and a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the kardashian.</v>

1449
01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:23.630
<v Speaker 3>Kim kardashians said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1450
01:01:23.631 --> 01:01:25.820
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people think that's me.</v>

1451
01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:26.510
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1452
01:01:27.090 --> 01:01:32.090
<v Speaker 3>and so she tried to sue old navy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think she does kind of look </v>

1453
01:01:32.090 --> 01:01:32.090
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or she looks like a,</v>

1454
01:01:32.090 --> 01:01:34.980
<v Speaker 3>a hotter version of the kardashians was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1455
01:01:35.060 --> 01:01:36.580
<v Speaker 3>how could you say that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hot.</v>

1456
01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:38.130
<v Speaker 3>It's ridiculous.</v>

1457
01:01:38.190 --> 01:01:40.290
<v Speaker 4>How could you say that this is what the </v>
<v Speaker 4>girl looks like.</v>

1458
01:01:40.291 --> 01:01:43.500
<v Speaker 4>You're not allowed to use this girl.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This girl looks like that.</v>

1459
01:01:43.501 --> 01:01:45.810
<v Speaker 4>But you're not allowed to use her </v>
<v Speaker 4>because she looks too much.</v>

1460
01:01:45.811 --> 01:01:47.640
<v Speaker 4>Like actually you should do ads for </v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

1461
01:01:47.910 --> 01:01:50.610
<v Speaker 4>I don't think even if she did so fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>one.</v>

1462
01:01:50.611 --> 01:01:52.410
<v Speaker 4>It's not like this girl is your own </v>
<v Speaker 4>face.</v>

1463
01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:55.140
<v Speaker 4>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't sue someone for using a pretty</v>

1464
01:01:55.141 --> 01:01:57.090
<v Speaker 4>girls face because that pretty girl that</v>
<v Speaker 4>happened.</v>

1465
01:01:57.091 --> 01:02:02.091
<v Speaker 4>So it was like you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what did that pretty girls never </v>

1466
01:02:02.091 --> 01:02:02.091
<v Speaker 4>allowed to work again because she looks </v>
<v Speaker 4>too much like you.</v>

1467
01:02:02.091 --> 01:02:03.640
<v Speaker 4>If they're tryiNg to replace her at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>chIna.</v>

1468
01:02:03.730 --> 01:02:05.880
<v Speaker 4>Like even so what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what dude,</v>

1469
01:02:05.881 --> 01:02:10.881
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if even if they were trying to replace </v>

1470
01:02:10.881 --> 01:02:12.591
<v Speaker 4>her,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if this girl has her own face and this </v>

1471
01:02:12.591 --> 01:02:12.591
<v Speaker 4>company chooses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what?</v>

1472
01:02:12.591 --> 01:02:13.290
<v Speaker 4>I like this girl.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She looks like kim kardashian,</v>

1473
01:02:13.291 --> 01:02:16.320
<v Speaker 4>but she's prettier and she's unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's use her.</v>

1474
01:02:16.530 --> 01:02:21.530
<v Speaker 4>That they should be when more than </v>
<v Speaker 4>allowed to do that when they her as a </v>

1475
01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:21.530
<v Speaker 4>spokesman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but</v>

1476
01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:21.530
<v Speaker 5>they use her voice anyway.</v>

1477
01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:22.720
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's definitely doable.</v>

1478
01:02:22.810 --> 01:02:27.810
<v Speaker 4>A perfect example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>say I'm what if someone decides to do a,</v>

1479
01:02:28.410 --> 01:02:33.410
<v Speaker 4>some sort of a video game or something </v>
<v Speaker 4>about fear factor and they have a dude </v>

1480
01:02:33.931 --> 01:02:38.100
<v Speaker 4>pretend to be me and he looks kinda like</v>
<v Speaker 4>me and talks kinda like me,</v>

1481
01:02:38.101 --> 01:02:40.560
<v Speaker 4>and they say it's me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well then I consider that a problem.</v>

1482
01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:41.190
<v Speaker 4>Then I can say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

1483
01:02:41.191 --> 01:02:46.191
<v Speaker 4>that's not me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you decide to do fear factor and </v>

1484
01:02:46.191 --> 01:02:48.741
<v Speaker 4>you go and get some dude who looks like </v>
<v Speaker 4>me and he's good at it and he just does </v>

1485
01:02:48.741 --> 01:02:49.590
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't sue you.</v>

1486
01:02:49.710 --> 01:02:52.140
<v Speaker 4>He's just dealIng.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even if he's imitating me,</v>

1487
01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:57.320
<v Speaker 4>even if he's imitating that replaces me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you replaces me and he's doing the </v>

<v Speaker 4>appearance.</v>

1520
01:04:06.621 --> 01:04:09.830
<v Speaker 4>That's why there's no copyright laws in </v>

1605
01:07:32.291 --> 01:07:34.960
<v Speaker 1>we were in the airport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're thinking to fly planes a day,</v>

1606
01:07:35.060 --> 01:07:38.410
<v Speaker 1>like seven days or that was the canadian</v>
<v Speaker 1>tour that went on.</v>

1607
01:07:38.580 --> 01:07:41.560
<v Speaker 1>You had no direct flights at all while </v>
<v Speaker 1>we were up in the boondocks.</v>

<v Speaker 4>places in the winter.</v>

<v Speaker 4>environment like that.</v>

<v Speaker 4>the air.</v>

1651
01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:26.960
<v Speaker 4>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if they appreciate life better.</v>

1652
01:09:26.961 --> 01:09:29.540
<v Speaker 4>I've always thought about that better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No doubt.</v>

1653
01:09:29.950 --> 01:09:31.490
<v Speaker 4>No doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're always in the summer,</v>

1654
01:09:31.491 --> 01:09:33.440
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I appreciate it that much.</v>

1655
01:09:33.441 --> 01:09:35.600
<v Speaker 4>Although I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First time I stayed here,</v>

1656
01:09:35.601 --> 01:09:40.601
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I stayed here with my friend Gary </v>

1657
01:09:40.601 --> 01:09:42.850
<v Speaker 4>Valentine when I was doing something for</v>
<v Speaker 4>mtv and they gave me a room with two </v>

1658
01:09:42.850 --> 01:09:44.270
<v Speaker 4>beds and gary was up here for some </v>
<v Speaker 4>audition to crash with me.</v>

1659
01:09:44.700 --> 01:09:47.720
<v Speaker 4>We got up every day and we were like </v>
<v Speaker 4>another fucking shitty day in paradise.</v>

1660
01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:52.740
<v Speaker 4>So we were in our young twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I was like 24 or 25 or something </v>

1661
01:09:52.740 --> 01:09:52.740
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we were like,</v>

1662
01:09:52.740 --> 01:09:55.430
<v Speaker 4>this is fucking incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because we were living in New York where</v>

1663
01:09:55.431 --> 01:09:57.070
<v Speaker 4>every day was gray,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1664
01:09:57.170 --> 01:10:02.170
<v Speaker 4>from good luck from october to march,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most of the fucking sky is gray and it </v>

1665
01:10:03.561 --> 01:10:07.610
<v Speaker 4>sucks and it's either as raining or </v>
<v Speaker 4>snowing or it just sucks,</v>

1666
01:10:08.050 --> 01:10:10.070
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you get so used to this.</v>

1667
01:10:10.071 --> 01:10:12.020
<v Speaker 4>No rain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no snow,</v>

1668
01:10:12.230 --> 01:10:17.230
<v Speaker 4>no have to deal with weather.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think that when you take out in </v>

1669
01:10:17.230 --> 01:10:18.740
<v Speaker 4>nature as a variable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't have to consider nature.</v>

1670
01:10:18.980 --> 01:10:21.710
<v Speaker 4>People get like real cocky.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They get real.</v>

1671
01:10:21.711 --> 01:10:26.711
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just one of the reasons why the </v>

1672
01:10:26.711 --> 01:10:26.711
<v Speaker 4>la dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like when you think of la dishes,</v>

1673
01:10:26.711 --> 01:10:31.320
<v Speaker 4>at least I think of people who are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think of them as not just being soft </v>

1674
01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:33.260
<v Speaker 4>but delusional about their hardness.</v>

1675
01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:34.300
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1676
01:10:34.340 --> 01:10:35.580
<v Speaker 4>he's an la douche.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1677
01:10:35.610 --> 01:10:40.610
<v Speaker 4>la douche is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>always think they're tougher than they </v>

1678
01:10:40.610 --> 01:10:43.001
<v Speaker 4>are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Always think they're smarter than they </v>

1679
01:10:43.001 --> 01:10:43.001
<v Speaker 4>are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They always,</v>

1680
01:10:43.001 --> 01:10:44.210
<v Speaker 4>there was cocky.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's something cocky and I think part</v>

1681
01:10:44.211 --> 01:10:46.640
<v Speaker 4>of that is because they're never humbled</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the weather.</v>

1682
01:10:46.910 --> 01:10:48.920
<v Speaker 4>Explain watts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>explain watts.</v>

1683
01:10:48.921 --> 01:10:49.880
<v Speaker 4>It's black people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's totally,</v>

1684
01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:51.600
<v Speaker 4>totally different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Run.</v>

1685
01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:53.760
<v Speaker 4>I was talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1686
01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:57.890
<v Speaker 4>I was coming home from a fire once when </v>
<v Speaker 4>one time we were filming fear factor and</v>

1687
01:10:57.891 --> 01:11:02.891
<v Speaker 4>we were driving and it was during the </v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy wildfires and flying home from a </v>

1688
01:11:02.891 --> 01:11:03.560
<v Speaker 4>firewall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a fire.</v>

1689
01:11:03.890 --> 01:11:06.890
<v Speaker 4>We had a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we had to evacuate and we had finished a</v>

1690
01:11:06.891 --> 01:11:08.570
<v Speaker 4>stunt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We got done in time,</v>

1691
01:11:08.780 --> 01:11:11.270
<v Speaker 4>but when we got on the highway for an </v>
<v Speaker 4>hour,</v>

1692
01:11:11.570 --> 01:11:15.870
<v Speaker 4>a full hour of going 55 miles an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like not fast.</v>

1693
01:11:15.871 --> 01:11:18.210
<v Speaker 4>No one was driving fast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was highway speeds.</v>

1694
01:11:18.330 --> 01:11:23.330
<v Speaker 4>The whole right side of the highway was </v>
<v Speaker 4>engulfed in flames as far as you could </v>

1695
01:11:23.330 --> 01:11:27.351
<v Speaker 4>see it was crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but one of the things I remember is how </v>

1696
01:11:27.351 --> 01:11:31.551
<v Speaker 4>polite everybody was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People were using their blinkers and </v>

1697
01:11:31.551 --> 01:11:35.181
<v Speaker 4>people were waving and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I looked around and everybody was </v>

1698
01:11:35.181 --> 01:11:36.240
<v Speaker 4>scared and slack jawed when you deal </v>
<v Speaker 4>with snow,</v>

1699
01:11:36.241 --> 01:11:38.560
<v Speaker 4>like if you go up to Maine during a snow</v>
<v Speaker 4>storm,</v>

1700
01:11:38.730 --> 01:11:43.730
<v Speaker 4>I was driving up north during the </v>
<v Speaker 4>snowstorm and my car broke down and I </v>

1701
01:11:43.730 --> 01:11:44.370
<v Speaker 4>had to like hang out with the people and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the toll booth,</v>

1702
01:11:44.490 --> 01:11:49.490
<v Speaker 4>like they took me in because it was too </v>
<v Speaker 4>cold for me to be outside and they </v>

1703
01:11:49.490 --> 01:11:49.920
<v Speaker 4>hooked me up and.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But everybody was friendly.</v>

1704
01:11:49.921 --> 01:11:51.170
<v Speaker 4>Can we get you some coffee?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1705
01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:54.340
<v Speaker 4>like every milan because tHey're all </v>
<v Speaker 4>banding together to,</v>

1706
01:11:54.430 --> 01:11:57.150
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because there's this fucking crazy thing</v>

1707
01:11:57.151 --> 01:11:59.370
<v Speaker 4>outside that can kill all the people's.</v>

1708
01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:01.210
<v Speaker 4>Not been my experience with new yorkers </v>
<v Speaker 4>involved.</v>

1709
01:12:01.590 --> 01:12:03.120
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of the urban,</v>

1710
01:12:03.300 --> 01:12:08.300
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the urban pressure that comes with that </v>

1711
01:12:08.300 --> 01:12:10.221
<v Speaker 4>to the giant numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Giant numbers of people is a problem </v>

1712
01:12:10.221 --> 01:12:10.380
<v Speaker 4>because people get dehumanized by the </v>
<v Speaker 4>pressure.</v>

1713
01:12:10.710 --> 01:12:14.160
<v Speaker 4>But I think overall people in the east </v>
<v Speaker 4>coast are more realistic.</v>

1714
01:12:14.410 --> 01:12:16.080
<v Speaker 4>They're more realistic in their </v>
<v Speaker 4>behavior,</v>

1715
01:12:16.081 --> 01:12:17.910
<v Speaker 4>more realistic in the way they think </v>
<v Speaker 4>about themselves.</v>

1716
01:12:17.911 --> 01:12:19.620
<v Speaker 4>They might be cocky and it might be </v>
<v Speaker 4>arrogant,</v>

1717
01:12:19.621 --> 01:12:22.830
<v Speaker 4>but there's a different different </v>
<v Speaker 4>version of it.</v>

1718
01:12:22.831 --> 01:12:26.040
<v Speaker 4>Then you get in California,</v>
<v Speaker 4>California is missing the element of the</v>

1719
01:12:26.041 --> 01:12:27.600
<v Speaker 4>weather.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You never have to consider it.</v>

1720
01:12:28.180 --> 01:12:29.240
<v Speaker 4>You never have to worry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1721
01:12:29.310 --> 01:12:31.710
<v Speaker 4>I just think it has the opposite effect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you're just going to flourish as</v>

1722
01:12:31.711 --> 01:12:33.090
<v Speaker 4>a person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can do that too.</v>

1723
01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:38.160
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's basically a in how you look </v>

1724
01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:38.160
<v Speaker 4>at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it hurts you,</v>

1725
01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:38.310
<v Speaker 4>but I think it might hurt a dummy.</v>

1726
01:12:38.490 --> 01:12:43.490
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think when you're living in the east </v>

1727
01:12:43.490 --> 01:12:45.501
<v Speaker 4>coast and hurricanes come and you've got</v>
<v Speaker 4>to fucking batten down the hatches for </v>

1728
01:12:45.501 --> 01:12:48.771
<v Speaker 4>the hurricane you get out of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It kind of puts things into perspective </v>

1729
01:12:48.771 --> 01:12:51.860
<v Speaker 4>when you get out there and you see trees</v>
<v Speaker 4>ripped out of their roots and fucking </v>

1730
01:12:51.860 --> 01:12:53.790
<v Speaker 4>windows broken and houses and cars </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking flipped over.</v>

1731
01:12:53.791 --> 01:12:56.460
<v Speaker 4>Like that puts it into perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you ain't shit,</v>

1732
01:12:56.760 --> 01:13:01.760
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and everybody better band together </v>

1733
01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:03.621
<v Speaker 4>because there's some other stuff out </v>
<v Speaker 4>there besides people and it can fucking </v>

1734
01:13:03.621 --> 01:13:05.550
<v Speaker 4>kill people and some of it is air.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How about that?</v>

1735
01:13:05.820 --> 01:13:10.820
<v Speaker 4>How about the air becomes a scary </v>
<v Speaker 4>monster that rips fucking buildings off </v>

1736
01:13:10.820 --> 01:13:14.691
<v Speaker 4>its foundations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wipes out entire towns and people are </v>

1737
01:13:14.691 --> 01:13:15.240
<v Speaker 4>running around worried about vampires.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck.</v>

1738
01:13:15.241 --> 01:13:18.630
<v Speaker 4>Vampire tornadoes are way scarier than </v>
<v Speaker 4>vampires.</v>

1739
01:13:18.810 --> 01:13:23.810
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a vampire can't just destroy your house </v>

1740
01:13:23.810 --> 01:13:25.430
<v Speaker 4>in here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who's wearing fat girls?</v>

1741
01:13:26.050 --> 01:13:29.160
<v Speaker 4>Girls and I'm worried they're hoping </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're hoping for a vampire.</v>

1742
01:13:30.150 --> 01:13:33.390
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if they're hoping they like</v>
<v Speaker 4>to believe.</v>

1743
01:13:33.660 --> 01:13:35.530
<v Speaker 4>Isn't it funny that they like to combine</v>
<v Speaker 4>those twos?</v>

1744
01:13:36.060 --> 01:13:41.060
<v Speaker 4>Vampires and romance were something </v>
<v Speaker 4>about him being undead is sexy.</v>

1745
01:13:43.470 --> 01:13:44.610
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could never.</v>

1746
01:13:44.670 --> 01:13:46.800
<v Speaker 4>You could never leave you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's that.</v>

1747
01:13:46.850 --> 01:13:49.140
<v Speaker 4>It's also that you know the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1748
01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:51.990
<v Speaker 4>the futility,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the obvious futility of the relationship</v>

1749
01:13:51.991 --> 01:13:55.680
<v Speaker 4>because unless he kills her and eater or</v>
<v Speaker 4>unless he turns her into a vampire,</v>

1750
01:13:55.681 --> 01:14:00.681
<v Speaker 4>she can't stay with him because she's </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to grow old and he's going to be </v>

1751
01:14:00.681 --> 01:14:02.130
<v Speaker 4>young forever and it's like this romance</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the fact that he loves her.</v>

1752
01:14:02.131 --> 01:14:04.410
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just a metaphor for,</v>

1753
01:14:04.411 --> 01:14:05.940
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone has problems.</v>

1754
01:14:05.970 --> 01:14:10.650
<v Speaker 4>They'll be able to agree to spend the </v>
<v Speaker 4>rest of your life with a woman.</v>

1755
01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:12.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you agree to make</v>

1756
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:15.880
<v Speaker 1>that life in eternity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much more so romantic would that be?</v>

1757
01:14:16.150 --> 01:14:18.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's also the forbIdden love.</v>

1758
01:14:19.150 --> 01:14:21.250
<v Speaker 1>The fact that he supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous,</v>

1759
01:14:21.251 --> 01:14:23.290
<v Speaker 1>but no one knows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody thinks he's a monster,</v>

1760
01:14:23.291 --> 01:14:25.540
<v Speaker 1>but you know the real him and around </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1761
01:14:25.541 --> 01:14:27.090
<v Speaker 1>he safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But around other men,</v>

1762
01:14:27.130 --> 01:14:30.040
<v Speaker 1>he pulls his fangs on every runs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to kill him.</v>

1763
01:14:30.380 --> 01:14:33.190
<v Speaker 1>But you don't know him and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at yourself.</v>

1764
01:14:33.220 --> 01:14:35.170
<v Speaker 1>You're dating a vampire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop it.</v>

1765
01:14:35.350 --> 01:14:37.930
<v Speaker 1>She led a vampire fucker in the twilight</v>
<v Speaker 1>movies.</v>

1766
01:14:37.931 --> 01:14:40.900
<v Speaker 1>They've logged vampire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck the shit out of her.</v>

1767
01:14:40.950 --> 01:14:41.680
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1768
01:14:41.870 --> 01:14:46.870
<v Speaker 1>Would you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you fuck a vampire chick if she </v>

1769
01:14:46.870 --> 01:14:46.870
<v Speaker 1>gave you life forever?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A no.</v>

1770
01:14:46.870 --> 01:14:48.940
<v Speaker 1>What's some crazy big pitcher wants to </v>
<v Speaker 1>eat me.</v>

1771
01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:50.490
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fell in love.</v>

1772
01:14:50.610 --> 01:14:52.770
<v Speaker 1>Now listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>killed them.</v>

1773
01:14:53.290 --> 01:14:55.690
<v Speaker 1>Vampires aren't people you see when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>got to kill them,</v>

1774
01:14:55.990 --> 01:14:57.340
<v Speaker 1>you got to stick with 10 people.</v>

1775
01:14:57.470 --> 01:14:59.110
<v Speaker 1>There's a reason why we don't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>mountain lions.</v>

1776
01:14:59.111 --> 01:15:01.600
<v Speaker 1>Just wandering through our streets like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have pigeons.</v>

1777
01:15:02.110 --> 01:15:04.130
<v Speaker 1>Pigeons are helpless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd go,</v>

1778
01:15:04.310 --> 01:15:05.830
<v Speaker 1>I'd go over immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He fucker.</v>

1779
01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:08.470
<v Speaker 1>I go over and then start telling about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the people,</v>

1780
01:15:08.471 --> 01:15:11.410
<v Speaker 1>the mortals I know really telling on </v>
<v Speaker 1>them like I know where they live.</v>

1781
01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:14.920
<v Speaker 1>Do you say this in january?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you saying this in jest?</v>

1782
01:15:14.950 --> 01:15:17.170
<v Speaker 1>I would definitely become a mortal </v>
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>

1783
01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:20.440
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People want to live longer.</v>

1784
01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:21.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what if when you die,</v>

1785
01:15:21.491 --> 01:15:26.491
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we're talking about vampires were </v>

1786
01:15:26.491 --> 01:15:26.770
<v Speaker 1>talking about something so silly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if we're talking about vampires,</v>

1787
01:15:26.980 --> 01:15:29.800
<v Speaker 1>then we're talking about evil things and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about if you die,</v>

1788
01:15:29.801 --> 01:15:31.630
<v Speaker 1>you're going to go to hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now hell exists.</v>

1789
01:15:31.660 --> 01:15:34.120
<v Speaker 1>If vampire's exists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cal probably exist too,</v>

1790
01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:36.790
<v Speaker 1>but you're never going to hell because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're on debt and you'd get killed.</v>

1791
01:15:37.570 --> 01:15:39.940
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to kill it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then your soul goes to hell.</v>

1792
01:15:39.970 --> 01:15:41.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fucked for each client because if</v>

1793
01:15:41.891 --> 01:15:44.160
<v Speaker 1>you accept vampirism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would have to accept.</v>

1794
01:15:44.190 --> 01:15:46.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to accept all kinds of thing.</v>

1795
01:15:46.930 --> 01:15:48.350
<v Speaker 1>Damped by god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1796
01:15:48.430 --> 01:15:50.740
<v Speaker 1>you got accept a bunch of other stupid </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit that goes along with.</v>

1797
01:15:50.741 --> 01:15:53.290
<v Speaker 1>It just seems like god fucked up there </v>
<v Speaker 1>agaiN.</v>

1798
01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:56.380
<v Speaker 1>They dammed up to eternal life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1799
01:15:56.550 --> 01:15:57.970
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty cool.</v>

1800
01:15:58.510 --> 01:16:03.510
<v Speaker 1>Another fuckup yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But isn't there a potion to off being a </v>

1801
01:16:03.510 --> 01:16:08.221
<v Speaker 1>vampire?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Drinks blood and then you gave up your </v>

1802
01:16:08.221 --> 01:16:08.230
<v Speaker 1>vampire power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that.</v>

1803
01:16:08.260 --> 01:16:10.480
<v Speaker 1>That's some shit where people make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>regular blood.</v>

1804
01:16:11.590 --> 01:16:15.610
<v Speaker 1>All these fucking pussy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cutesy vampires with beautiful hair.</v>

1805
01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:17.350
<v Speaker 1>That's not what a vampire I suppose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it take to?</v>

1806
01:16:17.351 --> 01:16:19.210
<v Speaker 1>The heart kills you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It kills you.</v>

1807
01:16:19.330 --> 01:16:24.330
<v Speaker 1>Like garlic kills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You try all sorts of different </v>

1808
01:16:24.330 --> 01:16:28.110
<v Speaker 1>variations on the vampire theme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a book out called the </v>

1809
01:16:28.110 --> 01:16:30.670
<v Speaker 1>strain is a guillermo del toro and some </v>
<v Speaker 1>other book on camp.</v>

1810
01:16:31.210 --> 01:16:36.210
<v Speaker 1>It starts out bad ass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but ultimately completely fizzles and </v>

1811
01:16:36.210 --> 01:16:38.370
<v Speaker 1>becomes stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It becomes like almost like they ran out</v>

1812
01:16:38.371 --> 01:16:43.371
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had like 10 pages where they have </v>

1813
01:16:43.371 --> 01:16:45.241
<v Speaker 1>to finish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they just finished and then he shot </v>

1814
01:16:45.241 --> 01:16:45.241
<v Speaker 1>him and he died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1815
01:16:45.241 --> 01:16:48.871
<v Speaker 1>It's the sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in it's Weird and literature for </v>

1816
01:16:48.871 --> 01:16:50.140
<v Speaker 1>them because it seems like almost like </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's written by two different people.</v>

1817
01:16:50.590 --> 01:16:54.730
<v Speaker 1>One person was really new doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a producer and director.</v>

1818
01:16:54.820 --> 01:16:57.340
<v Speaker 1>He's the guy who did pan's labyrinth </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a great,</v>

1819
01:16:57.341 --> 01:16:58.780
<v Speaker 1>great movie labyrinth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

1820
01:16:58.950 --> 01:17:00.010

<v Speaker 1>but it was,</v>

1821
01:17:00.070 --> 01:17:05.070
<v Speaker 1>this book is almost like it's written by</v>
<v Speaker 1>one person than the other person </v>

1822
01:17:05.070 --> 01:17:08.611
<v Speaker 1>finished.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It almost seems like because in the </v>

1823
01:17:08.611 --> 01:17:09.010
<v Speaker 1>beginning they set everything up bad ass</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's like really?</v>

1824
01:17:09.470 --> 01:17:10.400
<v Speaker 1>And suspenseful</v>

<v Speaker 4>Like a real page turner.</v>

1827
01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:15.810
<v Speaker 4>Like I remember I was reading it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1828
01:17:15.890 --> 01:17:19.520
<v Speaker 4>in Germany and everybody else in the ufc</v>
<v Speaker 4>was going to go to some after party.</v>

1829
01:17:19.530 --> 01:17:21.920
<v Speaker 4>I purposely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now I'm kinda tired.</v>

1830
01:17:21.980 --> 01:17:24.980
<v Speaker 4>I went back to my room to read this book</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it was that good.</v>

1831
01:17:25.010 --> 01:17:27.020
<v Speaker 4>I was so addicted to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I stuck with it.</v>

1832
01:17:27.230 --> 01:17:29.900
<v Speaker 4>But then it turns into a stupid book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the last,</v>

1833
01:17:29.901 --> 01:17:32.840
<v Speaker 4>like 40 page story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All of a sudden you're like,</v>

1834
01:17:32.841 --> 01:17:34.340
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It didN't do that.</v>

1835
01:17:34.341 --> 01:17:36.110
<v Speaker 4>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the detail was gone.</v>

1836
01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:38.870
<v Speaker 4>Like all of a sudden it was just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this happened and that happened.</v>

1837
01:17:38.871 --> 01:17:39.410
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1838
01:17:39.411 --> 01:17:41.930
<v Speaker 4>What are you doing to fix in the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the movie?</v>

1839
01:17:42.340 --> 01:17:43.550
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1840
01:17:43.551 --> 01:17:48.551
<v Speaker 4>I Don't think it's going to be a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were trying to make it a mini </v>

1841
01:17:48.551 --> 01:17:50.471
<v Speaker 4>series,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's a way they have billboards </v>

1842
01:17:50.471 --> 01:17:50.471
<v Speaker 4>up portland.</v>

1843
01:17:50.471 --> 01:17:50.471
<v Speaker 4>I posted bills.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh really?</v>

1844
01:17:50.471 --> 01:17:50.471
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the strain.</v>

1845
01:17:50.570 --> 01:17:51.950
<v Speaker 4>Oh wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For the book,</v>

1846
01:17:51.951 --> 01:17:53.510
<v Speaker 4>for the book just came out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1847
01:17:53.540 --> 01:17:55.070
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the second book came out,</v>

1848
01:17:55.071 --> 01:17:56.960
<v Speaker 4>but that was at least a year ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe.</v>

1849
01:17:56.961 --> 01:18:01.961
<v Speaker 4>The second boat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or maybe they're making a movie about </v>

1850
01:18:01.961 --> 01:18:01.961
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe.</v>

1851
01:18:01.961 --> 01:18:04.301
<v Speaker 4>I thought they were going to try.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought that I think the original </v>

1852
01:18:04.301 --> 01:18:04.820
<v Speaker 4>thing was a treatment for a mini series </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then they decided to.</v>

1853
01:18:05.210 --> 01:18:07.490
<v Speaker 4>He decided to turn into a book and sell </v>
<v Speaker 4>the book.</v>

1854
01:18:07.850 --> 01:18:11.120
<v Speaker 4>But like two days ago I started seeing </v>
<v Speaker 4>the bills for really strain the movie.</v>

1855
01:18:11.121 --> 01:18:16.121
<v Speaker 4>Let's google that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But my point is and said it said don't </v>

1856
01:18:16.121 --> 01:18:17.320
<v Speaker 4>invite them in or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or don't.</v>

1857
01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:19.520
<v Speaker 4>Don't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think they're already lands?</v>

1858
01:18:19.521 --> 01:18:22.310
<v Speaker 4>Labyrinth?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Porn version would be pam finally have a</v>

1859
01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:24.280
<v Speaker 4>trailer out already?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1860
01:18:25.070 --> 01:18:26.240
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they'll do better than that.</v>

1861
01:18:26.300 --> 01:18:26.930
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1862
01:18:26.940 --> 01:18:28.850
<v Speaker 4>there's a trilogy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what it is.</v>

1863
01:18:29.180 --> 01:18:34.180
<v Speaker 4>I think it's the book was the sequel to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the book because it doesn't say </v>

1864
01:18:34.180 --> 01:18:34.180
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1865
01:18:34.180 --> 01:18:35.950
<v Speaker 4>the strain movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hm.</v>

1866
01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:37.340
<v Speaker 4>Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hm.</v>

1867
01:18:37.700 --> 01:18:39.290
<v Speaker 4>Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you're getting peed on brian?</v>

1868
01:18:39.670 --> 01:18:41.540
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Won't happen again.</v>

1869
01:18:41.630 --> 01:18:42.140
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1870
01:18:42.141 --> 01:18:45.280
<v Speaker 4>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a real movie old del toro.</v>

1871
01:18:45.740 --> 01:18:50.740
<v Speaker 4>it's a real movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But my point about vampires is that </v>

1872
01:18:50.740 --> 01:18:50.740
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these guys did another different take on</v>

1873
01:18:50.740 --> 01:18:51.530
<v Speaker 4>the vampire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>

1874
01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:53.510
<v Speaker 4>this vampire didn't have fangs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1875
01:18:53.511 --> 01:18:55.250
<v Speaker 4>They always want to reinvent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I get,</v>

1876
01:18:55.251 --> 01:18:56.180
<v Speaker 4>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>come on man,</v>

1877
01:18:56.880 --> 01:18:59.930
<v Speaker 4>don't even attack your throat like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>regular vampire does.</v>

1878
01:19:00.020 --> 01:19:02.450
<v Speaker 4>They put a little tiny incision that you</v>
<v Speaker 4>can't even see.</v>

1879
01:19:02.780 --> 01:19:04.470
<v Speaker 4>You can barely see it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so.</v>

1880
01:19:05.150 --> 01:19:07.230
<v Speaker 4>It's like a tongue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Their tongue more.</v>

1881
01:19:07.730 --> 01:19:12.730
<v Speaker 4>Some like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like little laser fucking razor blade </v>

1882
01:19:12.730 --> 01:19:12.730
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really dumb.</v>

1883
01:19:12.890 --> 01:19:17.890
<v Speaker 4>It's like nosferatu nosferatu.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The vampire is supposed to look like </v>

1884
01:19:17.890 --> 01:19:20.750
<v Speaker 4>that old one from the 19 hundreds.</v>

1885
01:19:20.750 --> 01:19:23.120
<v Speaker 4>The one that was like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a silent radio.</v>

1886
01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:24.800
<v Speaker 4>That's what they're supposed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What it's supposed to look like.</v>

1887
01:19:24.801 --> 01:19:27.140
<v Speaker 4>The undead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're supposed to look like a horrible</v>

1888
01:19:27.141 --> 01:19:32.141
<v Speaker 4>fucking creeps and it's supposed to have</v>
<v Speaker 4>fangs and it's supposed to jack your </v>

1889
01:19:32.141 --> 01:19:32.390
<v Speaker 4>throat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything else you're inventing,</v>

1890
01:19:32.570 --> 01:19:34.460
<v Speaker 4>you're just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're inventing a new thing.</v>

1891
01:19:34.490 --> 01:19:37.400
<v Speaker 4>Just didn't invite me in movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes or yes.</v>

1892
01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:38.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1893
01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:40.870
<v Speaker 4>Check from superbad or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1894
01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:41.840
<v Speaker 4>that was pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1895
01:19:41.841 --> 01:19:44.240
<v Speaker 4>I saw the original version two.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember the name of it.</v>

1896
01:19:44.390 --> 01:19:47.690
<v Speaker 4>One of them's invite me and invite me in</v>
<v Speaker 4>as the american version.</v>

1897
01:19:47.780 --> 01:19:50.360
<v Speaker 4>I forget what the other one let me in </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever it was.</v>

1898
01:19:50.361 --> 01:19:52.890
<v Speaker 4>I saw both of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the thing about it,</v>

1899
01:19:52.980 --> 01:19:54.310
<v Speaker 4>it's about a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 4>girl,</v>

1900
01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:56.120
<v Speaker 4>girl who's a vampire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty dope.</v>

1901
01:19:56.330 --> 01:19:59.870
<v Speaker 4>It's realistic forever or whatever it </v>
<v Speaker 4>is.</v>

1902
01:19:59.930 --> 01:20:01.450
<v Speaker 4>Apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gauge it is really cool.</v>

1903
01:20:01.451 --> 01:20:03.230
<v Speaker 4>I'm super realistic because.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly what it is.</v>

1904
01:20:03.231 --> 01:20:04.520
<v Speaker 4>Super realistic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

1905
01:20:04.580 --> 01:20:05.260
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1906
01:20:05.330 --> 01:20:07.800
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a great ending.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not sort of happy.</v>

1907
01:20:07.801 --> 01:20:08.040
<v Speaker 4>It's sort</v>

1908
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:13.040
<v Speaker 1>of like the american one wasn't as good </v>
<v Speaker 1>as the foreign one was.</v>

1909
01:20:13.170 --> 01:20:14.070
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was close.</v>

1910
01:20:14.071 --> 01:20:19.071
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say it wasn't as good because</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever you compare something to the </v>

1911
01:20:19.071 --> 01:20:20.300
<v Speaker 1>old something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you always go this new batman's gay,</v>

1912
01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:21.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just it's just natural.</v>

1913
01:20:21.870 --> 01:20:24.720
<v Speaker 1>But there's that scene in a tunnel where</v>
<v Speaker 1>she jacks that old man.</v>

1914
01:20:25.260 --> 01:20:26.640
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was good.</v>

1915
01:20:26.670 --> 01:20:27.740
<v Speaker 1>That was good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1916
01:20:27.741 --> 01:20:28.830
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and weird.</v>

1917
01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:31.470
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the new one you mean.</v>

1918
01:20:31.500 --> 01:20:36.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the way she did it was </v>

1919
01:20:36.500 --> 01:20:36.500
<v Speaker 1>frightening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that check is good.</v>

1920
01:20:36.500 --> 01:20:38.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1921
01:20:38.250 --> 01:20:41.640
<v Speaker 1>But that's a real goddamn vampire movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how they're supposed to be.</v>

1922
01:20:41.790 --> 01:20:43.290
<v Speaker 1>You can't invent stuff like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1923
01:20:43.291 --> 01:20:45.010
<v Speaker 1>they can go out in the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they sparkled.</v>

1924
01:20:46.490 --> 01:20:49.740
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1925
01:20:49.830 --> 01:20:50.640
<v Speaker 3>They radiate.</v>

1926
01:20:52.470 --> 01:20:54.120
<v Speaker 1>Not a vampire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is some,</v>

1927
01:20:54.180 --> 01:20:56.820
<v Speaker 1>some fake shit.</v>

01:21:05.850 --> 01:21:07.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1933
01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:10.670
<v Speaker 3>It happened again and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a nice piece.</v>

1934

<v Speaker 3>hard that it,</v>

2014
01:24:23.150 --> 01:24:23.800
<v Speaker 4>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always,</v>

2015
01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:29.300
<v Speaker 4>I always equate obsessive sexual </v>
<v Speaker 4>behavior with distraction.</v>

2016
01:24:29.660 --> 01:24:34.660
<v Speaker 4>I always say that when I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whenever in my life that I've been </v>

2017
01:24:34.660 --> 01:24:37.571
<v Speaker 4>obsessed sexually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it was obsessed with </v>

2018
01:24:37.571 --> 01:24:39.791
<v Speaker 4>masturbating or obsessed with fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's a distraction and that really </v>

2019
01:24:39.791 --> 01:24:44.381
<v Speaker 4>I was imbalanced and what I needed to do</v>
<v Speaker 4>was get my mind in order and then fuck </v>

2020
01:24:45.730 --> 01:24:46.620
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2021
01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:47.990
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not that I wouldn't fuck anymore,</v>

2022
01:24:47.991 --> 01:24:50.120
<v Speaker 4>but that I wouldn't be obsessive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2023
01:24:50.121 --> 01:24:55.121
<v Speaker 4>there's a certain level of fucking or </v>
<v Speaker 4>jerking off or anything where you do it </v>

2024
01:24:55.121 --> 01:24:58.511
<v Speaker 4>even when you're not even horny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you do it because this is the thing </v>

2025
01:24:58.511 --> 01:24:59.120
<v Speaker 4>you're obsessed with this thing you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>fixating on.</v>

2026
01:24:59.270 --> 01:25:01.740
<v Speaker 4>so like physically your dick is limited </v>
<v Speaker 4>edition.</v>

2027
01:25:01.820 --> 01:25:06.820
<v Speaker 4>You're not horny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yet you'll be chasing pussy like </v>

2028
01:25:06.820 --> 01:25:09.611
<v Speaker 4>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas like there's a big difference </v>

2029
01:25:09.611 --> 01:25:10.070
<v Speaker 4>between that and like say if your </v>
<v Speaker 4>girlfriend goes out of town for a couple</v>

2030
01:25:10.071 --> 01:25:15.071
<v Speaker 4>of weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to go back and it's been </v>

2031
01:25:15.071 --> 01:25:15.071
<v Speaker 4>weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you girlfriend goes out of town for a</v>

2032
01:25:15.071 --> 01:25:18.611
<v Speaker 4>couple of weeks and you haven't seen her</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you grab her and you hug and </v>

2033
01:25:18.611 --> 01:25:21.491
<v Speaker 4>you kiss and your decal time and you've </v>
<v Speaker 4>had that feeling.</v>

2034
01:25:22.061 --> 01:25:24.360
<v Speaker 4>Then when you grab her ashley like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh fuck yeah,</v>

2035
01:25:24.390 --> 01:25:26.190
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's real horniness</v>

2036
01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:31.680
<v Speaker 3>real deal stuff that I miss because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking four times a day that now It's </v>

2037
01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:31.860
<v Speaker 3>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

2038
01:25:31.861 --> 01:25:32.360
<v Speaker 3>must fuck.</v>

2039
01:25:32.620 --> 01:25:34.210
<v Speaker 4>That's what I'm thinking about your girl</v>
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>

2040
01:25:34.211 --> 01:25:37.150
<v Speaker 4>I think she can't really possibly be </v>
<v Speaker 4>experiencing that either.</v>

2041
01:25:37.270 --> 01:25:39.160
<v Speaker 4>She seems to be obsessing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2042
01:25:39.161 --> 01:25:43.000
<v Speaker 4>I understand the concept of nympho.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always wonder if getting all.</v>

2043
01:25:43.140 --> 01:25:44.320
<v Speaker 4>She's getting hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2044
01:25:44.330 --> 01:25:46.760
<v Speaker 4>But it's different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's different.</v>

2045
01:25:47.130 --> 01:25:49.840
<v Speaker 4>It's different for a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the whole setup is different,</v>

2046
01:25:50.090 --> 01:25:50.680
<v Speaker 4>but just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2047
01:25:50.681 --> 01:25:52.090
<v Speaker 4>it's not like a dick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2048
01:25:52.091 --> 01:25:56.680
<v Speaker 4>dick is a highly complicated biomedical </v>
<v Speaker 4>condition.</v>

2049
01:25:56.860 --> 01:25:57.760
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hard on.</v>

2050
01:25:57.850 --> 01:26:00.370
<v Speaker 4>Hard on is if a guy had a bone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2051
01:26:00.371 --> 01:26:03.070
<v Speaker 4>like if your dick was a bone and you can</v>
<v Speaker 4>just fuck all the time,</v>

2052
01:26:03.230 --> 01:26:06.560
<v Speaker 4>you would wear the skin after.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it would look like a rhino horn.</v>

2053
01:26:06.770 --> 01:26:11.770
<v Speaker 4>It would just be pointing at the tip and</v>
<v Speaker 4>all broken down and scabby and fucking </v>

2054
01:26:11.770 --> 01:26:13.160
<v Speaker 4>hard and you'd just be fucking all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

2055
01:26:14.750 --> 01:26:16.120
<v Speaker 4>But because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>

2056
01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:19.220
<v Speaker 4>your dick is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really complicated.</v>

2057
01:26:19.220 --> 01:26:22.160
<v Speaker 4>Sort of an arrangement where everythIng </v>
<v Speaker 4>has to be in line.</v>

2058
01:26:22.340 --> 01:26:25.010
<v Speaker 4>You have to have the right amount of </v>
<v Speaker 4>sexual confidence,</v>

2086
01:27:20.151 --> 01:27:23.030
<v Speaker 4>Before she kills you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got the wrong advice,</v>

2087
01:27:23.031 --> 01:27:25.430
<v Speaker 4>brian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's terrible advice.</v>

2088
01:27:25.990 --> 01:27:26.840
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I don't know what to do.</v>

2089
01:27:26.841 --> 01:27:30.230
<v Speaker 4>I got a doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mainly it's,</v>

2090
01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:31.970
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a psychological thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2091
01:27:31.990 --> 01:27:35.420
<v Speaker 4>I don't know physically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like everyone's different.</v>

2092
01:27:35.421 --> 01:27:37.040
<v Speaker 4>Obviously you're different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Much different than me.</v>

2093
01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:38.580
<v Speaker 4>I'm much different than our world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>

2094
01:27:38.710 --> 01:27:39.760
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's level.</v>

2095
01:27:39.950 --> 01:27:44.950
<v Speaker 4>Some people are autistic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure some girls are sexually just </v>

2096
01:27:44.950 --> 01:27:45.460
<v Speaker 4>chemically imbalanced to some point of </v>
<v Speaker 4>nymphomaniac,</v>

2097
01:27:45.480 --> 01:27:50.480
<v Speaker 4>like it's a physical thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I also believe that a lot of the </v>

2098
01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:52.010
<v Speaker 4>cases of nymphomaniac is distractions.</v>

2099
01:27:52.190 --> 01:27:54.230
<v Speaker 4>Just like a man being obsessed with </v>
<v Speaker 4>beating off that,</v>

2100
01:27:54.231 --> 01:27:59.231
<v Speaker 4>you can call that guy a nymphomaniac.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A girl is just like having a rhino dick </v>

2101
01:27:59.231 --> 01:28:01.490
<v Speaker 4>because he's distracted or did you say </v>
<v Speaker 4>what you're saying?</v>

2102
01:28:02.300 --> 01:28:04.250
<v Speaker 4>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're saying it's a distraction.</v>

2103
01:28:04.251 --> 01:28:09.251
<v Speaker 4>It's a lot of the reason why they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing it is because they're looking for </v>

2104
01:28:09.251 --> 01:28:10.490
<v Speaker 4>a distraction from somebody else,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from their life,</v>

2105
01:28:10.491 --> 01:28:15.491
<v Speaker 4>from focusing on your life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you have issues and things that make </v>

2106
01:28:15.491 --> 01:28:15.491
<v Speaker 4>you insecure things or where you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're.</v>

2107
01:28:15.491 --> 01:28:16.760
<v Speaker 4>You haven't accomplished what you want </v>
<v Speaker 4>to.</v>

2108
01:28:16.761 --> 01:28:19.820
<v Speaker 4>Things where you're not at a place where</v>
<v Speaker 4>you need to be emotionally or.</v>

2109
01:28:20.030 --> 01:28:20.750
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

2110
01:28:20.780 --> 01:28:21.830
<v Speaker 4>gambling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all those things.</v>

2111
01:28:21.831 --> 01:28:26.831
<v Speaker 4>They're all completely related to an </v>
<v Speaker 4>imbalance in your system and imbalance </v>

2112
01:28:26.831 --> 01:28:29.630
<v Speaker 4>of the human being.</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I get into the isolation tank,</v>

2113
01:28:29.810 --> 01:28:33.770
<v Speaker 4>the number one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the number one theme when I get in there</v>

2114
01:28:33.980 --> 01:28:36.950
<v Speaker 4>is sorting out things that are bothering</v>
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>

2115
01:28:36.950 --> 01:28:40.070
<v Speaker 4>It forces me to consider all the things </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are bothering me.</v>

2116
01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:43.790
<v Speaker 4>The isolation tank is the exact opposite</v>
<v Speaker 4>of going to a hooker.</v>

2117
01:28:44.180 --> 01:28:45.950
<v Speaker 4>See if you got some shit going on like </v>

<v Speaker 4>hookers out to clubs and they would </v>

2123
01:29:00.610 --> 01:29:01.310
<v Speaker 4>always pick up hookers and had hookers </v>
<v Speaker 4>that were constantly texting them.</v>

2128
01:29:11.341 --> 01:29:16.341
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was an obsession and a lot of that </v>

2129
01:29:16.341 --> 01:29:19.251
<v Speaker 4>obsession is because you don't like </v>
<v Speaker 4>certain parts of your own life and </v>

2130
01:29:19.251 --> 01:29:20.550
<v Speaker 4>you're trying to not think about your </v>
<v Speaker 4>problems.</v>

2131

<v Speaker 4>So instead of thinking about your </v>
<v Speaker 4>problems,</v>

<v Speaker 1>depression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>friends and whatever.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

2226

2255
01:34:31.370 --> 01:34:36.370

2256
01:34:36.370 --> 01:34:39.220
<v Speaker 1>about the relationships because the sex </v>

<v Speaker 1>nobody wants to admit that man is a bit </v>

2273
01:35:23.051 --> 01:35:23.051
<v Speaker 4>easy thing because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

01:35:49.870 --> 01:35:50.760
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't always work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2287
01:35:50.761 --> 01:35:55.761
<v Speaker 4>It took a few months of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I shot loads and our every single day </v>

2288
01:35:55.761 --> 01:35:56.990
<v Speaker 4>that she was operating and it still took</v>
<v Speaker 4>months.</v>

2289
01:35:57.260 --> 01:35:59.390
<v Speaker 4>Eddie bravo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know it's taken him.</v>

2290
01:35:59.391 --> 01:36:00.830
<v Speaker 4>He's trying to have a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I shouldn't talk about that.</v>

2291
01:36:00.831 --> 01:36:01.200
<v Speaker 4>And he went,</v>

2292
01:36:01.270 --> 01:36:06.270
<v Speaker 3>nobody wants to release that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My girlfriend played practical joke on </v>

2293
01:36:06.270 --> 01:36:08.681
<v Speaker 3>me because she did that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got a birth control test the other </v>

2294
01:36:08.681 --> 01:36:10.610
<v Speaker 3>day at target and she got a red sharpie </v>
<v Speaker 3>and made the mark so it was pregnant and</v>

2295
01:36:10.611 --> 01:36:13.520
<v Speaker 3>she just laid it on the bathroom floor </v>
<v Speaker 3>and didn't say anything.</v>

2296
01:36:13.550 --> 01:36:18.550
<v Speaker 4>They say it's a practical joke,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she probably wanted to see your </v>

2297
01:36:18.550 --> 01:36:21.401
<v Speaker 4>reaction because every girl,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every girl deep down inside wants to </v>

2298
01:36:21.401 --> 01:36:21.401
<v Speaker 4>have babies.</v>

2299
01:36:21.401 --> 01:36:21.401
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I.</v>

2300
01:36:21.480 --> 01:36:23.580
<v Speaker 3>My actual reaction with god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

2301
01:36:23.581 --> 01:36:25.780
<v Speaker 3>and I gave her a hug and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>god,</v>

2304
01:36:32.410 --> 01:36:36.950
<v Speaker 2>If you really told me you had a baby,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like all flashed in my head.</v>

2305
01:36:36.951 --> 01:36:38.840
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to get them to join the army,</v>

2306
01:36:40.750 --> 01:36:45.750

<v Speaker 2>I was just shocked and I was thinking </v>

2307
01:36:45.750 --> 01:36:46.460
<v Speaker 2>about in can you get a guy in boot camp </v>

<v Speaker 4>I don't want them to go overseas,</v>

2309
01:36:49.351 --> 01:36:51.420
<v Speaker 4>but he needs to go fuck your right to </v>
<v Speaker 4>being a cook guy.</v>

2310
01:36:51.480 --> 01:36:56.480
<v Speaker 4>He needs to go to Afghanistan and </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking run around with a backpack on </v>

2311

2342
01:38:09.290 --> 01:38:09.290
<v Speaker 4>everyone who hasn't changed their mind </v>
<v Speaker 4>fast enough that she denied it,</v>

2343
01:38:09.290 --> 01:38:11.580
<v Speaker 4>which is much more interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh really interesting.</v>

2344
01:38:11.581 --> 01:38:13.000
<v Speaker 4>To watch someone deny it.</v>

2349
01:38:21.100 --> 01:38:22.320
<v Speaker 4>remember him telling me about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how ridiculous he thought it was when it</v>

2350
01:38:22.321 --> 01:38:22.770
<v Speaker 4>happened.</v>

2351
01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:24.310
<v Speaker 4>At the time,</v>

<v Speaker 4>of these folks that are running this </v>

<v Speaker 4>country?</v>

<v Speaker 4>be illegal.</v>

2357
01:38:34.501 --> 01:38:36.540
<v Speaker 4>Everything they do that secret should be</v>
<v Speaker 4>open.</v>

2358
01:38:37.050 --> 01:38:42.050
<v Speaker 4>Transparency in government is the number</v>
<v Speaker 4>one reason why all the shake and take </v>

2359
01:38:42.050 --> 01:38:42.660
<v Speaker 4>place.</v>

2360
01:38:42.661 --> 01:38:47.661
<v Speaker 4>spies and fake data breaches and fake </v>
<v Speaker 4>hacks just so they can tighten down </v>

2361
01:38:47.661 --> 01:38:50.010
<v Speaker 4>security and just so they can make more </v>
<v Speaker 4>things secret.</v>

2494
01:44:19.631 --> 01:44:23.111
<v Speaker 1>comedy store when he talks about that </v>

<v Speaker 1>I like that name better.</v>

2531
01:45:47.151 --> 01:45:48.860
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>susko hannah weeds hilarious.</v>

2532
01:45:49.280 --> 01:45:50.900
<v Speaker 1>But what it was is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a tip,</v>

2533
01:45:50.901 --> 01:45:52.520
<v Speaker 1>ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do this with your weed.</v>

2534
01:45:52.700 --> 01:45:54.820
<v Speaker 1>Don't grind your weed up in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2535
01:45:55.170 --> 01:45:59.150
<v Speaker 1>a coffee grinder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done that for a little bit and it's</v>

2536
01:45:59.151 --> 01:46:04.151
<v Speaker 1>a matter of how many times you press it </v>
<v Speaker 1>down because it gets chopped up really </v>

2537
01:46:04.151 --> 01:46:08.201
<v Speaker 1>quIck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you put it in bowls or vaporizer </v>

2538
01:46:08.201 --> 01:46:08.201
<v Speaker 1>like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2539
01:46:08.201 --> 01:46:08.300
<v Speaker 1>that is good move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2540
01:46:08.500 --> 01:46:11.660
<v Speaker 1>Vaporizer at works like that because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have to worry In a vaporizer about</v>

2541
01:46:11.661 --> 01:46:16.661
<v Speaker 1>sucking air through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you roll a joint with it and </v>

2542
01:46:16.661 --> 01:46:16.820
<v Speaker 1>it's powder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's too hard to get oxygen through.</v>

2543
01:46:16.821 --> 01:46:21.821
<v Speaker 1>And so I don't think you'd get as high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what joey was responding to </v>

2544
01:46:21.821 --> 01:46:23.000
<v Speaker 1>the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That and the fact that he was in traffic</v>

2545
01:46:23.270 --> 01:46:24.800
<v Speaker 1>for like an hour and a half getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

2546
01:46:26.030 --> 01:46:29.810
<v Speaker 1>hair screaming at his gun's bike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You fuck.</v>

2547
01:46:29.990 --> 01:46:32.500
<v Speaker 1>And he made a video of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a layer it.</v>

2548
01:46:32.740 --> 01:46:33.440

<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2549
01:46:33.441 --> 01:46:38.441
<v Speaker 1>And he showed it to us after the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to add that video to the </v>

2550
01:46:38.441 --> 01:46:40.850
<v Speaker 1>end of the blog videos that we do on it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>if he sends his blogs,</v>

2552

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2553

2618
01:49:15.091 --> 01:49:17.760
<v Speaker 5>car.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then the fuck the amount of oil,</v>

2629
01:49:38.310 --> 01:49:39.810
<v Speaker 5>Wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's only one thing.</v>

2630
01:49:39.811 --> 01:49:43.110
<v Speaker 5>That engine is way simpler.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You just took out this battery,</v>

2631
01:49:43.111 --> 01:49:45.630
<v Speaker 5>put another one in that's there's </v>
<v Speaker 5>nothing can go wrong.</v>

2632
01:49:45.690 --> 01:49:47.990
<v Speaker 5>The way more can break on a regular car.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have prius</v>

2633
01:49:47.990 --> 01:49:49.830
<v Speaker 3>is down pretty good right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2634
01:49:49.950 --> 01:49:51.300
<v Speaker 3>they have an even better thIng.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh look,</v>

2635
01:49:51.360 --> 01:49:53.590
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think if you're somewhere and you need</v>

2636
01:49:53.650 --> 01:49:56.890
<v Speaker 3>fucking energy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't rely just on energy.</v>

2637
01:49:56.891 --> 01:50:01.891
<v Speaker 3>You have to have gas because what if.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What if this whole thing fails and they </v>

2638
01:50:01.891 --> 01:50:01.891
<v Speaker 3>decide to add,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck this.</v>

2639
01:50:01.891 --> 01:50:03.240
<v Speaker 3>I at least want your car debt and being </v>
<v Speaker 3>able to save.</v>

2640
01:50:03.410 --> 01:50:08.410
<v Speaker 3>What would it be?</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of these batteries become,</v>

2641
01:50:09.041 --> 01:50:10.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they stop making the car,</v>

2642
01:50:10.450 --> 01:50:15.450
<v Speaker 3>the company goes out of business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've got a busIness just like pontiac</v>

2643
01:50:18.611 --> 01:50:22.690
<v Speaker 3>or just like all the other business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they stopped.</v>

2644
01:50:22.691 --> 01:50:27.691
<v Speaker 3>They stopped making these batteries and </v>
<v Speaker 3>how that would happen to the bay for </v>

2645
01:50:27.691 --> 01:50:28.090
<v Speaker 3>$50,000,000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>how long would it have to be?</v>

2646
01:50:28.170 --> 01:50:30.100
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how long would have to be a.</v>

2647
01:50:30.220 --> 01:50:31.690
<v Speaker 3>It's around until you get a car like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2648
01:50:31.970 --> 01:50:33.310
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will get a hybrid.</v>

2649
01:50:33.340 --> 01:50:38.340
<v Speaker 3>I'll get a like a prius type thing or </v>
<v Speaker 3>like how long would electrical stuff </v>

2650
01:50:38.340 --> 01:50:38.340
<v Speaker 3>have to be around before you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2651
01:50:38.340 --> 01:50:40.660
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not just going to enter to win.</v>

2652
01:50:40.720 --> 01:50:44.230
<v Speaker 3>It's a win.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the batteries are the same for every</v>

2653
01:50:44.231 --> 01:50:46.570
<v Speaker 3>single car or what's the law?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're completely happy.</v>

2654
01:50:46.830 --> 01:50:48.080
<v Speaker 3>That's the only time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the</v>

2655
01:50:48.090 --> 01:50:50.970
<v Speaker 4>way I feel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way I feel where I know that there's</v>

2656
01:50:50.971 --> 01:50:55.971
<v Speaker 4>some sort of a peak oil situation and </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're slowly going to run out of </v>

2657
01:50:55.971 --> 01:50:56.930
<v Speaker 4>resources and electric cars will slowly </v>
<v Speaker 4>take over.</v>

2658
01:50:57.330 --> 01:51:02.330
<v Speaker 4>I fucking love driving a big fat stupid </v>
<v Speaker 4>v eight right now because I know this </v>

2659
01:51:02.330 --> 01:51:03.120
<v Speaker 4>is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These are the last of the mohicans.</v>

2660
01:51:03.220 --> 01:51:07.260
<v Speaker 4>I never get any pleasure out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My mustang to drive my mustang.</v>

2661
01:51:07.290 --> 01:51:08.880
<v Speaker 4>I'll let you drive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've been in that room before.</v>

2662
01:51:08.881 --> 01:51:11.160
<v Speaker 4>You want to drive it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll get it once you drive it.</v>

2663
01:51:11.370 --> 01:51:13.740
<v Speaker 4>Once you get behInd that thing in that </v>
<v Speaker 4>aluminum block,</v>

2664
01:51:13.741 --> 01:51:18.690
<v Speaker 4>550 fucking horsepower.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The snarl of four inch tailpipes.</v>

2665
01:51:19.140 --> 01:51:24.140
<v Speaker 4>Can they not make a fast car like that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It won't sound right.</v>

2666
01:51:25.261 --> 01:51:26.880
<v Speaker 4>It won't be right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'll be cool.</v>

2667
01:51:27.060 --> 01:51:29.340
<v Speaker 4>They have a tesla,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the tesla roadster.</v>

2668
01:51:29.341 --> 01:51:31.210
<v Speaker 4>That's very.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2669
01:51:31.320 --> 01:51:34.100
<v Speaker 4>the tesla roadster is a very fast car </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's uh,</v>

2670
01:51:34.110 --> 01:51:36.120
<v Speaker 4>it's interesting because it's a little </v>
<v Speaker 4>sports car,</v>

2671
01:51:36.450 --> 01:51:37.870
<v Speaker 4>but it's all balanced all.</v>

2672
01:51:37.870 --> 01:51:39.240
<v Speaker 4>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got a honda right now,</v>

2673
01:51:39.241 --> 01:51:41.150
<v Speaker 4>so I'm not getting that job anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2674
01:51:41.400 --> 01:51:43.260
<v Speaker 4>I know you're not getting the joy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you should.</v>

2675
01:51:43.860 --> 01:51:46.720
<v Speaker 4>You should you because you have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You drive a have a five slash six speed,</v>

2676
01:51:46.730 --> 01:51:48.210
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2677
01:51:48.330 --> 01:51:51.420
<v Speaker 4>Your car is a manual to manual that </v>
<v Speaker 4>manual,</v>

2678
01:51:51.421 --> 01:51:55.470
<v Speaker 4>not a manual man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what it's like to shift all the</v>

2679
01:51:55.471 --> 01:51:56.100
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

2680
01:51:56.120 --> 01:52:00.630
<v Speaker 4>That's dotson olag manuals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I liked them for cars.</v>

2681
01:52:00.740 --> 01:52:02.900
<v Speaker 4>I dOn't like them for traffic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I liked him.</v>

2682
01:52:03.120 --> 01:52:04.470
<v Speaker 4>I like him for real cars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2683
01:52:04.471 --> 01:52:06.530
<v Speaker 4>When you drive a mustang and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2684
01:52:06.600 --> 01:52:11.600
<v Speaker 4>one of the gt $500 and a manual and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't really go through the fucking </v>

2685
01:52:11.600 --> 01:52:11.600
<v Speaker 4>gears.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You feel it though.</v>

2686
01:52:11.600 --> 01:52:13.710
<v Speaker 4>You feel the mechanics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you engage the gear,</v>

2687
01:52:13.711 --> 01:52:17.340
<v Speaker 4>you're selling a lot more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how long you're going to go in overdrive</v>

2688
01:52:17.460 --> 01:52:19.830
<v Speaker 4>to downshift how much speed you can get.</v>

2689
01:52:19.830 --> 01:52:24.830
<v Speaker 4>You can't do that with an automatic car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're just hoping it keeps shifting </v>

2690
01:52:24.830 --> 01:52:24.830
<v Speaker 4>with the right time you have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2691
01:52:24.830 --> 01:52:25.280
<v Speaker 4>Well you can definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The.</v>

2692
01:52:25.290 --> 01:52:30.290
<v Speaker 4>Today they have these called a double </v>
<v Speaker 4>clutch boxes like m three has a double </v>

2693
01:52:30.290 --> 01:52:33.120
<v Speaker 4>clutch box and what that is is an </v>
<v Speaker 4>automatic,</v>

2694
01:52:33.121 --> 01:52:37.920
<v Speaker 4>but it's a standard like you can set it </v>
<v Speaker 4>up to shift gears where you could rev it</v>

2695
01:52:37.921 --> 01:52:42.921
<v Speaker 4>up as far as you want and use the </v>
<v Speaker 4>paddles to shift gears like all the </v>

2696
01:52:42.921 --> 01:52:43.440
<v Speaker 4>ferrari so you can do yourself new fires</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the bicycle.</v>

2697
01:52:43.920 --> 01:52:48.920
<v Speaker 4>Exactly a little higher.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm still trying to speak to as long as </v>

2698
01:52:49.470 --> 01:52:54.470
<v Speaker 4>your heart's content,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you shift with the paddles and it's </v>

2699
01:52:54.470 --> 01:52:56.900
<v Speaker 4>instantaneous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The shifts are like franco section.</v>

2700
01:52:56.930 --> 01:52:58.850
<v Speaker 4>Almost many,</v>
<v Speaker 4>many cars have it now.</v>

2701
01:52:59.280 --> 01:53:04.280
<v Speaker 4>Porsche has.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's called a double clutch gearbox </v>

2702
01:53:04.280 --> 01:53:06.640
<v Speaker 4>double.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What it means is it's actually a seven </v>

2703
01:53:06.640 --> 01:53:09.341
<v Speaker 4>speed with the m three has one and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>a seven speed and what it is is there's </v>

2704
01:53:09.341 --> 01:53:13.901
<v Speaker 4>one gear that's inside one gear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're engaged one gear and then the </v>

2705
01:53:13.901 --> 01:53:15.470
<v Speaker 4>clutch will already pick up the second </v>
<v Speaker 4>gear.</v>

2706
01:53:15.800 --> 01:53:18.590
<v Speaker 4>So as you're shifting gears the next </v>
<v Speaker 4>gear,</v>

2707
01:53:18.591 --> 01:53:20.920
<v Speaker 4>it's like instantaneous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when it,</v>

2708
01:53:20.930 --> 01:53:23.780
<v Speaker 4>when it releases the first gear and </v>
<v Speaker 4>picks up the second gear,</v>

2709
01:53:24.020 --> 01:53:25.280
<v Speaker 4>it does it with no,</v>

2710
01:53:25.450 --> 01:53:27.300
<v Speaker 2>like when you're shifting into a regular</v>
<v Speaker 2>car,</v>

2711
01:53:27.301 --> 01:53:31.170
<v Speaker 2>you have to go with a neutral to </v>
<v Speaker 2>neutral.</v>

2712
01:53:31.171 --> 01:53:33.810
<v Speaker 2>When you hit the clutch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you put it into second gear and then you</v>

2713
01:53:33.811 --> 01:53:38.811
<v Speaker 2>release the clutch and now it's in </v>
<v Speaker 2>second that press on this thing you </v>

2714
01:53:38.811 --> 01:53:38.811
<v Speaker 2>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's first gen,</v>

2715
01:53:38.811 --> 01:53:40.290
<v Speaker 2>second game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's instantaneous.</v>

2716
01:53:40.770 --> 01:53:41.880
<v Speaker 2>That electric car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many?</v>

2717
01:53:41.910 --> 01:53:43.680
<v Speaker 2>How long does It take to charge a </v>
<v Speaker 2>battery?</v>

2718
01:53:43.681 --> 01:53:45.360
<v Speaker 2>Like 12 hours?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2719
01:53:45.370 --> 01:53:47.250
<v Speaker 2>not nearly that long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can charge it overnight.</v>

2720
01:53:47.251 --> 01:53:52.251
<v Speaker 2>You can sit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can have an ipod program that sets </v>

2721
01:53:52.251 --> 01:53:52.251
<v Speaker 2>it to charge during non peak hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Each charge is what?</v>

2722
01:53:52.251 --> 01:53:53.940
<v Speaker 2>Eighty miles?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No way more than that.</v>

2723
01:53:55.500 --> 01:53:57.980
<v Speaker 2>It's way better than what you think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>300 matalan.</v>

2724
01:53:58.020 --> 01:54:03.020
<v Speaker 2>You look into the stats about 300 right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now because right now you're asking me </v>

2725
01:54:03.091 --> 01:54:06.520
<v Speaker 2>to quote yourself and I don't know if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you guessed 80 and I don't know.</v>

2726
01:54:07.130 --> 01:54:07.740
<v Speaker 2>He got excited.</v>

2727
01:54:07.830 --> 01:54:12.830
<v Speaker 2>Notice he raised his voice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you want to look in here trying to </v>

2728
01:54:12.830 --> 01:54:12.830
<v Speaker 2>make points and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're all just guessing.</v>

2729
01:54:12.830 --> 01:54:17.510
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm not the haters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>But at the point was to say like you </v>

2730
01:54:17.510 --> 01:54:17.510
<v Speaker 2>want to go 80 miles away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way too little,</v>

2731
01:54:17.510 --> 01:54:19.200
<v Speaker 2>80 miles would not be willing to drive </v>
<v Speaker 2>to Texas.</v>

2732
01:54:19.260 --> 01:54:21.210
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you need seven batteries?</v>

2733
01:54:21.670 --> 01:54:23.160
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you still up at gas stations?</v>

2734

<v Speaker 2>anyone's driving to Texas.</v>

2735
01:54:29.420 --> 01:54:31.440
<v Speaker 2>When the fuck is the last time you drove</v>
<v Speaker 2>to Texas?</v>

2736
01:54:31.450 --> 01:54:36.450
<v Speaker 2>He like 20 minutes trying to take a road</v>
<v Speaker 2>trip is one.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2738

<v Speaker 2>Hold on.</v>

2739
01:54:39.610 --> 01:54:41.940
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

2740
01:54:42.060 --> 01:54:45.030

<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2741
01:54:45.060 --> 01:54:46.650
<v Speaker 2>So you want to go to vegas?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got ain't shit.</v>

2742
01:54:48.030 --> 01:54:51.930
<v Speaker 2>You just have to stop at 99 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Charge for six hours.</v>

2743
01:54:51.931 --> 01:54:56.931
<v Speaker 2>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's what I liked that you got happy </v>

2744
01:54:56.931 --> 01:54:58.560
<v Speaker 2>that it wasn't as good as 300 miles </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it made the point earlier.</v>

2745
01:54:59.790 --> 01:55:03.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying that if you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get a car for the most part,</v>

2746
01:55:03.360 --> 01:55:05.550
<v Speaker 2>we get a mix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want all batteries.</v>

2747
01:55:05.551 --> 01:55:07.260
<v Speaker 2>What I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I didn't have 300 miles,</v>

2748
01:55:07.261 --> 01:55:10.590
<v Speaker 2>I would want a better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I get to go 300 miles on a charge,</v>

2749
01:55:10.620 --> 01:55:13.350
<v Speaker 4>actually this is up to 100 miles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which means you're probably.</v>

2750
01:55:13.360 --> 01:55:14.720
<v Speaker 4>That's way too low.</v>
<v Speaker 4>60.</v>

2751
01:55:14.760 --> 01:55:19.760
<v Speaker 4>How much is the volt?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't seem like it should be out </v>

2752
01:55:19.760 --> 01:55:19.760
<v Speaker 4>in the market yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2753
01:55:19.760 --> 01:55:19.760
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>

2754
01:55:19.760 --> 01:55:24.350
<v Speaker 4>The epa has rated the nissan leaf a </v>
<v Speaker 4>driving range of 73 miles per charge </v>

2755
01:55:25.081 --> 01:55:27.900
<v Speaker 4>range will vary with driving habits,</v>
<v Speaker 4>conditions,</v>

2756
01:55:27.901 --> 01:55:32.901
<v Speaker 4>weather and battery age,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's whack and it's ugly as fuck.</v>

2757
01:55:34.710 --> 01:55:39.710
<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm taking you to the ford website and </v>

<v Speaker 1>Smart,</v>

2763
01:55:49.940 --> 01:55:51.240
<v Speaker 1>smart cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not as bad as you think.</v>

2764
01:55:51.241 --> 01:55:53.550
<v Speaker 1>Safety wise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no fun.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You don't feel the growl of the va and </v>
<v Speaker 1>get that store you don't like.</v>

2766
01:56:01.010 --> 01:56:06.010
<v Speaker 1>That gives you a thrill that that's what</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting on an open highway are how </v>

2767
01:56:06.010 --> 01:56:06.010
<v Speaker 1>old are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thirty seven.</v>

2768
01:56:06.010 --> 01:56:07.110
<v Speaker 1>You're going to like it in about five </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

2769
01:56:07.250 --> 01:56:08.810
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Open highways,</v>

2770
01:56:09.500 --> 01:56:11.940
<v Speaker 1>you know what's great though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Windy roads,</v>

2771
01:56:11.970 --> 01:56:13.350
<v Speaker 1>that's when it's great to have a fun </v>
<v Speaker 1>car.</v>

2772
01:56:13.800 --> 01:56:15.750
<v Speaker 1>I get too scared now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't even have to drive fast.</v>

2773
01:56:15.751 --> 01:56:17.370
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to drive fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Used to feeling of,</v>

2774
01:56:17.570 --> 01:56:22.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a little bit of a windy road and </v>

2775
01:56:22.570 --> 01:56:25.431
<v Speaker 1>make sure you're controlling the car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You feel the tightness of the </v>

2776
01:56:25.431 --> 01:56:25.431
<v Speaker 1>suspension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2777
01:56:25.431 --> 01:56:26.580
<v Speaker 1>The nissan volt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus christ,</v>

2778
01:56:26.770 --> 01:56:28.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean 50 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fifty miles.</v>

2779
01:56:28.921 --> 01:56:30.540
<v Speaker 1>Fifty miles on it's fucking battery.</v>

2780
01:56:30.800 --> 01:56:32.340
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where you can't even get to work.</v>

2781
01:56:32.490 --> 01:56:35.880
<v Speaker 1>The all electric rang the epa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All my god.</v>

2782
01:56:35.881 --> 01:56:40.881
<v Speaker 1>Is it electric range?</v>
<v Speaker 1>According to the epa is 35 miles.</v>

2783
01:56:40.980 --> 01:56:45.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get stalled traffic on the four or </v>

2784
01:56:45.980 --> 01:56:46.950
<v Speaker 1>five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The total range is 379 Miles.</v>

2785
01:56:46.951 --> 01:56:50.310
<v Speaker 1>So that means if you got to fill up a </v>
<v Speaker 1>gas,</v>

2786
01:56:50.460 --> 01:56:54.000
<v Speaker 1>your fuel economy is through the roof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's 93 miles per gallon.</v>

2787
01:56:54.330 --> 01:56:58.080
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that is um,</v>

2788
01:56:58.250 --> 01:57:01.380
<v Speaker 1>that's if you go a half an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2789
01:57:01.410 --> 01:57:03.660
<v Speaker 1>37 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thirty seven.</v>

2790
01:57:03.790 --> 01:57:05.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>37 miles an hour.</v>

2791
01:57:05.880 --> 01:57:09.930
<v Speaker 1>TheY have the recharge thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like where the breaks retarded it.</v>

2792
01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:10.890
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what it is.</v>

2793
01:57:11.450 --> 01:57:14.910
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's 93 miles per gallon in all electric</v>

2794
01:57:14.911 --> 01:57:16.350
<v Speaker 1>mode.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand that.</v>

2795
01:57:16.800 --> 01:57:20.670
<v Speaker 1>And 37 miles per gallon in gasoline only</v>
<v Speaker 1>mode.</v>

2796
01:57:21.300 --> 01:57:24.480
<v Speaker 1>So I guess you have the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have the option.</v>

2797
01:57:24.540 --> 01:57:27.690
<v Speaker 1>So a combined gas and electric fuel </v>
<v Speaker 1>economy.</v>

2798
01:57:27.690 --> 01:57:31.120
<v Speaker 1>Reading of 60 miles per gallon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty fucking good man.</v>

2799
01:57:32.100 --> 01:57:34.560
<v Speaker 1>My car gets 15 and that's what it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>rated at,</v>

2800
01:57:34.561 --> 01:57:37.560
<v Speaker 1>so probably gets 10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>my card is like 27 or something.</v>

2801
01:57:37.680 --> 01:57:40.560
<v Speaker 1>I need to switch my car but I want an </v>
<v Speaker 1>suv and I don't want.</v>

2802
01:57:40.710 --> 01:57:42.760
<v Speaker 1>I might get the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they have to do so much,</v>

2803
01:57:42.770 --> 01:57:44.990
<v Speaker 1>but this is kind of interesting though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The chevY and it.</v>

2804
01:57:45.110 --> 01:57:47.790
<v Speaker 1>What else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What it does is it operates the battery.</v>

2805
01:57:47.791 --> 01:57:52.791
<v Speaker 1>It operates on pure battery power until </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's battery capacity is depleted,</v>

2806
01:57:53.610 --> 01:57:58.610
<v Speaker 1>at which point it fires up the engine </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the gasoline engine powers and </v>

2807
01:57:58.610 --> 01:58:02.550
<v Speaker 1>electric generator to extend the </v>
<v Speaker 1>vehicles range so that how it operates,</v>

2808
01:58:02.551 --> 01:58:05.820
<v Speaker 1>it mostly operates on electricity as </v>
<v Speaker 1>long as you have enough power in there.</v>

2809
01:58:06.150 --> 01:58:09.430
<v Speaker 1>So it's almost like that's why it wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same as it was like how.</v>

2810
01:58:09.490 --> 01:58:10.770
<v Speaker 1>How is it different if it's half and </v>
<v Speaker 1>half,</v>

2811
01:58:10.830 --> 01:58:11.550
<v Speaker 1>it's not quite happening.</v>

2812
01:58:11.700 --> 01:58:16.700
<v Speaker 1>It definitely seems like a better move </v>
<v Speaker 1>than the volt because at least you can </v>

2813
01:58:16.700 --> 01:58:16.700
<v Speaker 1>get gas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2814
01:58:16.880 --> 01:58:17.280
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2815
01:58:17.281 --> 01:58:18.030
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The.</v>

2816
01:58:18.190 --> 01:58:20.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The volt is better than the leaf because</v>

2817
01:58:20.281 --> 01:58:22.170
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hybrid seems to be the way to go.</v>

2818
01:58:22.380 --> 01:58:27.380
<v Speaker 1>Especially 76 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless you're just drIving five miles </v>

2819
01:58:27.380 --> 01:58:27.380
<v Speaker 1>back and forth to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not,</v>

2820
01:58:27.380 --> 01:58:29.340
<v Speaker 1>that's not really realistic at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any road trip is you're fucked.</v>

2821
01:58:29.400 --> 01:58:30.060
<v Speaker 1>I always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2822
01:58:30.061 --> 01:58:35.061
<v Speaker 1>I always think what if I had to go on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>road trip and I know you say there was </v>

2823
01:58:35.061 --> 01:58:37.020
<v Speaker 1>some sort of 70 percent charge you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>get in 20 minutes really quick charge on</v>

2824
01:58:37.240 --> 01:58:38.820
<v Speaker 1>don't know one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

2825
01:58:38.880 --> 01:58:43.880
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is you don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to stop and have to do </v>

2826
01:58:43.880 --> 01:58:46.000
<v Speaker 1>that in you miles that's weak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this thing sounds better.</v>

2827
01:58:46.030 --> 01:58:49.630
<v Speaker 1>This thing can go 370 million miles and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is like a normal car.</v>

2828
01:58:49.840 --> 01:58:53.080
<v Speaker 1>You just go into the gas and it can keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>going and that one keeps shifting,</v>

2829
01:58:53.650 --> 01:58:55.290
<v Speaker 1>changing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just have weekends,</v>

2830
01:58:55.300 --> 01:59:00.300
<v Speaker 1>engines sound like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that these are for </v>

2831
01:59:00.300 --> 01:59:00.300
<v Speaker 1>transportation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is,</v>

2832
01:59:00.300 --> 01:59:04.020
<v Speaker 1>we're going to miss this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something we're already missing in the </v>

2833
01:59:04.020 --> 01:59:05.120
<v Speaker 1>transition between the gasoline powered </v>
<v Speaker 1>cars like you,</v>

2834
01:59:05.330 --> 01:59:05.860
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2835
01:59:05.861 --> 01:59:08.180
<v Speaker 1>you get in an old mustang smell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2836
01:59:08.181 --> 01:59:09.430
<v Speaker 1>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we missed a smug.</v>

2837
01:59:09.460 --> 01:59:12.370
<v Speaker 1>We definitely do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we also missed the analog connection</v>

2838
01:59:12.371 --> 01:59:16.270
<v Speaker 1>between the person in the vehicle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a fun connection between cars.</v>

2839
01:59:16.510 --> 01:59:20.160
<v Speaker 1>my aunt got up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she got some nice parallels like a lexus</v>

2840
01:59:20.161 --> 01:59:25.161
<v Speaker 1>or infinity or something and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it had an analog clock on it and I was </v>

2841
01:59:25.181 --> 01:59:25.410
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2842
01:59:25.411 --> 01:59:26.380
<v Speaker 1>why don't you have that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>

2843
01:59:26.381 --> 01:59:31.381
<v Speaker 1>because it's class here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was so excited to have this thing </v>

2844
01:59:31.381 --> 01:59:31.381
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

2845
01:59:31.381 --> 01:59:31.381
<v Speaker 1>it's harder to read.</v>

2846
01:59:31.381 --> 01:59:33.520
<v Speaker 1>Why that class?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you get a stick shift then?</v>

2847
01:59:33.521 --> 01:59:35.080
<v Speaker 1>What are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Writes in cursive.</v>

2848
01:59:35.680 --> 01:59:36.720
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2849
01:59:36.730 --> 01:59:39.840
<v Speaker 1>that's not easy to read clock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do that with lexuses.</v>

2850
01:59:40.090 --> 01:59:43.180
<v Speaker 1>Maybe with alexa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're looking for a split second.</v>

2851
01:59:43.181 --> 01:59:46.600
<v Speaker 1>It's your time and it's not supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out what were the big hand is.</v>

2852
01:59:46.930 --> 01:59:49.480
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it funny that digital watch has </v>
<v Speaker 1>never really caught on?</v>

2853

<v Speaker 4>He looked at the the nature.</v>

3084
02:08:57.941 --> 02:08:59.530
<v Speaker 4>Look at the ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the mountains.</v>

3085
02:08:59.540 --> 02:09:01.560
<v Speaker 4>It's all beautiful and natural and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>you see cities.</v>

3086
02:09:01.561 --> 02:09:04.030
<v Speaker 4>It really does look like something's </v>
<v Speaker 4>growing there.</v>

3087
02:09:04.360 --> 02:09:06.100
<v Speaker 4>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well maybe that's what we're here for.</v>

3088
02:09:06.280 --> 02:09:10.720
<v Speaker 4>Maybe we are just like mold or sandwich </v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe over here to we're here to meet,</v>

3089
02:09:10.750 --> 02:09:12.460
<v Speaker 4>eat the sandwich.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3090
02:09:12.610 --> 02:09:13.900
<v Speaker 4>it's really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe that's it.</v>

3091
02:09:14.200 --> 02:09:17.230
<v Speaker 4>Maybe we're here to fuck things up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably noT.</v>

3092
02:09:17.520 --> 02:09:21.340
<v Speaker 4>Maybe we don't have a fucking purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Build the robots to kill us.</v>

3093
02:09:21.810 --> 02:09:22.530
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's.</v>

3094
02:09:22.590 --> 02:09:27.590
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seems to be the process of </v>

3095
02:09:27.590 --> 02:09:29.431
<v Speaker 4>complexity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like we're a part of the process of </v>

3096
02:09:29.431 --> 02:09:31.351
<v Speaker 4>complexity and that definitely seen if </v>
<v Speaker 4>there is a purpose or a need or a </v>

3097
02:09:31.351 --> 02:09:32.320
<v Speaker 4>direction that everything's going in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going in that way.</v>

3098
02:09:32.430 --> 02:09:34.060
<v Speaker 4>everything is getting more and more </v>
<v Speaker 4>complex.</v>

3099
02:09:34.061 --> 02:09:39.061
<v Speaker 4>It seems to be inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seems to be an ethic seems to be </v>

3100
02:09:39.061 --> 02:09:39.460
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The way things work well,</v>

3101
02:09:39.610 --> 02:09:42.640
<v Speaker 4>when you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of what everything.</v>

3102
02:09:42.641 --> 02:09:45.550
<v Speaker 4>Everything is moving in a direction of </v>
<v Speaker 4>complexity.</v>

3103
02:09:45.551 --> 02:09:48.850
<v Speaker 4>It's all a lot more advanced really </v>
<v Speaker 4>fast,</v>

3104
02:09:49.540 --> 02:09:53.550
<v Speaker 4>but the whole universe is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The universe starts out with a,</v>

3105
02:09:53.551 --> 02:09:54.610
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a small,</v>

3106
02:09:54.611 --> 02:09:57.430
<v Speaker 4>tiny spot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>smaller than the head of a pin blows up,</v>

3107
02:09:57.431 --> 02:10:00.040
<v Speaker 4>expands multicellular life forums.</v>

3108
02:10:00.040 --> 02:10:03.940
<v Speaker 4>That book comes intelligent sent in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>able to change its environment.</v>

3109
02:10:03.941 --> 02:10:08.941
<v Speaker 4>Then it starts changing at a rapid pace.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It all seems to be a direction and </v>

3110
02:10:08.941 --> 02:10:09.040
<v Speaker 4>ethic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what do you think?</v>

3111
02:10:09.041 --> 02:10:11.380
<v Speaker 4>What are you going to do differently?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't do anything differently.</v>

3112
02:10:11.381 --> 02:10:16.381
<v Speaker 4>I think what we're trying to pretend </v>
<v Speaker 4>that we have it solved and we're trying </v>

3113
02:10:16.381 --> 02:10:16.580
<v Speaker 4>to pretend like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3114
02:10:16.610 --> 02:10:20.020
<v Speaker 4>we as people we need to get together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would be nice if we were cool to each</v>

3115
02:10:20.021 --> 02:10:21.250
<v Speaker 4>other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That would be nice.</v>

3116
02:10:21.400 --> 02:10:24.520
<v Speaker 4>It would be nice if we could all enjoy </v>
<v Speaker 4>our time here and.</v>

3117
02:10:24.521 --> 02:10:25.900
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and not be concerned.</v>

3118
02:10:25.930 --> 02:10:29.750
<v Speaker 4>That would be nice sources.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

3119
02:10:29.860 --> 02:10:32.410
<v Speaker 4>Either way before those codes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even when it's not nice at san francisco</v>

3120
02:10:32.411 --> 02:10:33.940
<v Speaker 4>is still people are cooler.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nicer.</v>

3121
02:10:34.010 --> 02:10:34.940
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well let's.</v>

3122
02:10:34.941 --> 02:10:36.500
<v Speaker 4>Because they moved away from the east </v>
<v Speaker 4>coast.</v>

3123
02:10:36.800 --> 02:10:41.800
<v Speaker 4>Everybody initially landed on the east </v>
<v Speaker 4>coast and the ones who couldn't take it </v>

3124
02:10:41.800 --> 02:10:41.800
<v Speaker 4>anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so fuck this.</v>

3125
02:10:41.800 --> 02:10:45.230
<v Speaker 4>I'm Going west and they kept going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the one thing that we can do,</v>

3126
02:10:45.260 --> 02:10:46.790
<v Speaker 4>everybody says y'all we need to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3127
02:10:47.030 --> 02:10:51.290
<v Speaker 4>people need to figure out a way to work </v>
<v Speaker 4>this out and we need to work together to</v>

3128
02:10:51.291 --> 02:10:56.291
<v Speaker 4>change the way that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if that's gonna I have a </v>

3129
02:10:56.291 --> 02:10:56.291
<v Speaker 4>feeling that what we're doing is </v>
<v Speaker 4>natural.</v>

3130
02:10:56.291 --> 02:10:59.300
<v Speaker 4>I have a feeling what we're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>war corruption,</v>

3131
02:10:59.510 --> 02:11:04.510
<v Speaker 4>the depletion of resources.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seems to me that every other animal </v>

3132
02:11:04.510 --> 02:11:07.790
<v Speaker 4>that does fucked up things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's hyenas kidnapping dogs.</v>

3133
02:11:07.791 --> 02:11:10.090
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever seen that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or if you're seeing that not heinous.</v>

3134
02:11:10.250 --> 02:11:13.190
<v Speaker 4>Baboons kidnapping puppies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they raised puppies.</v>

3135
02:11:13.191 --> 02:11:14.660
<v Speaker 4>They have feral puppies that go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3136
02:11:14.661 --> 02:11:17.120
<v Speaker 4>they become dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They stay with them their whole life and</v>

3137
02:11:17.121 --> 02:11:20.420
<v Speaker 4>they guard their camps so the babylon </v>
<v Speaker 4>and sleep at night and the dogs bark.</v>

3138
02:11:20.540 --> 02:11:22.970
<v Speaker 4>It's intense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's complicated though,</v>

3139
02:11:22.971 --> 02:11:23.630
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but.</v>

3140
02:11:23.690 --> 02:11:26.360
<v Speaker 4>But people look at it and they don't go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my god,</v>

3141
02:11:26.361 --> 02:11:27.710
<v Speaker 4>what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They go,</v>

3142
02:11:27.711 --> 02:11:28.820
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well this is natural.</v>

3143
02:11:28.880 --> 02:11:31.730
<v Speaker 4>The baboons have figured out that if </v>
<v Speaker 4>they kidnap these puppies,</v>

3144
02:11:31.731 --> 02:11:33.110
<v Speaker 4>they can get these puppies to guard the </v>
<v Speaker 4>camp.</v>

3145
02:11:33.111 --> 02:11:35.870
<v Speaker 4>It's like natural for humans to war with</v>
<v Speaker 4>each other.</v>

3146
02:11:35.880 --> 02:11:38.720
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One hundred percent natural doesn't mean</v>

3147
02:11:38.721 --> 02:11:39.610
<v Speaker 4>it's good for us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3148
02:11:39.620 --> 02:11:44.620
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't mean it's good for us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's sorta means that it's going to </v>

3149
02:11:44.620 --> 02:11:44.620
<v Speaker 4>see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you say good for us.</v>

3150
02:11:44.620 --> 02:11:46.280
<v Speaker 4>You're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about you.</v>

3151
02:11:46.600 --> 02:11:50.210
<v Speaker 4>You is definitely good for those people </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are getting money out of the war.</v>

3152
02:11:50.310 --> 02:11:51.820
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you say it's not.</v>

3153
02:11:51.980 --> 02:11:56.980
<v Speaker 4>But for those dick cheney characters </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are getting billions of dollars </v>

3154
02:11:56.980 --> 02:11:57.560
<v Speaker 4>while a little brown people get bombed </v>
<v Speaker 4>on it is good for them.</v>

3155
02:11:57.590 --> 02:12:02.590
<v Speaker 4>They profit for yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it is natural for someone who is </v>

3156
02:12:02.590 --> 02:12:07.301
<v Speaker 4>unscrupulous to pursue those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those paths because there's money to be </v>

3157
02:12:07.301 --> 02:12:07.301
<v Speaker 4>made from it.</v>

3158
02:12:07.301 --> 02:12:08.020
<v Speaker 4>And I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3159
02:12:08.140 --> 02:12:10.460
<v Speaker 4>even though my print out short,</v>
<v Speaker 4>should it mean it's,</v>

3160
02:12:10.461 --> 02:12:15.461
<v Speaker 4>it's frowned upon for a bunch of reasons</v>
<v Speaker 4>because we're all in this together and </v>

3161
02:12:15.461 --> 02:12:18.611
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we all think that people shouldn't </v>

3162
02:12:18.611 --> 02:12:18.611
<v Speaker 4>be treating each other like that and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>completely agree,</v>

3163
02:12:18.611 --> 02:12:22.070
<v Speaker 4>but on a natural starfish or how's that </v>
<v Speaker 4>work?</v>

3164
02:12:22.080 --> 02:12:27.080
<v Speaker 4>Never hear that thing where it's like a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The guy picked up a starfish on the </v>

3165
02:12:27.080 --> 02:12:27.080
<v Speaker 4>beach,</v>
<v Speaker 4>throw it back in the ocean.</v>

3166
02:12:27.220 --> 02:12:29.300
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was another friend was like,</v>

3167
02:12:29.540 --> 02:12:31.310
<v Speaker 4>there's thousands of starfish on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>beach,</v>

3168
02:12:31.340 --> 02:12:32.870
<v Speaker 4>like you can't possibly hope to save </v>
<v Speaker 4>them all.</v>

3169
02:12:32.871 --> 02:12:34.910
<v Speaker 4>Like what difference are you making?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3170
02:12:34.911 --> 02:12:35.330
<v Speaker 4>Then he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3171
02:12:35.331 --> 02:12:40.100
<v Speaker 4>it matters that wants to go first.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'm more of like an individual,</v>

3172
02:12:40.101 --> 02:12:41.540
<v Speaker 4>smaller level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Somebody to traffic.</v>

3173
02:12:41.840 --> 02:12:43.400
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well look,</v>

3174
02:12:43.910 --> 02:12:45.590
<v Speaker 4>anything you'd really easy to make a </v>
<v Speaker 4>difference.</v>

3175
02:12:45.640 --> 02:12:47.090
<v Speaker 4>Anything you do that makes the world </v>
<v Speaker 4>better,</v>

3176
02:12:47.120 --> 02:12:48.980
<v Speaker 4>whether it's telling jokes to make </v>
<v Speaker 4>people laugh,</v>

3177
02:12:49.020 --> 02:12:52.220
<v Speaker 4>making a song that people like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just saying hi to someone at the grocery</v>

3178
02:12:52.221 --> 02:12:54.260
<v Speaker 4>store and it gives them a nice warm </v>
<v Speaker 4>smile.</v>

3179
02:12:54.890 --> 02:12:59.890
<v Speaker 4>AnYthing you do that's positive is good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anything you do that helps people is </v>

3180
02:12:59.890 --> 02:13:03.191
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anything you do that makes this </v>

3181
02:13:03.191 --> 02:13:03.191
<v Speaker 4>experience better,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but ultimately it's all temporary.</v>

3182
02:13:03.191 --> 02:13:05.180
<v Speaker 4>The entire experience of life on this </v>
<v Speaker 4>planet,</v>

3183
02:13:05.181 --> 02:13:06.650
<v Speaker 4>for everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>including your,</v>

3184
02:13:06.651 --> 02:13:09.730
<v Speaker 4>your future children.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all completely temporary.</v>

3185
02:13:09.770 --> 02:13:10.820
<v Speaker 4>Enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3186
02:13:10.880 --> 02:13:15.620
<v Speaker 4>you got to enjoy it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the direction that it's going,</v>

3187
02:13:15.650 --> 02:13:18.560
<v Speaker 4>if you were looking at this direction,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you are looking at human behavior,</v>

3188
02:13:18.770 --> 02:13:22.250
<v Speaker 4>if you were looking at any other animal </v>
<v Speaker 4>that was behaving like this,</v>

3189
02:13:22.251 --> 02:13:25.190
<v Speaker 4>you would assume that it's natural.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When bees make beehives,</v>

3190
02:13:25.280 --> 02:13:27.230
<v Speaker 4>you assume it's natural.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is what they do,</v>

3191
02:13:27.231 --> 02:13:29.750
<v Speaker 4>and ants make some giant complicated ant</v>
<v Speaker 4>farms.</v>

3192
02:13:29.990 --> 02:13:31.680
<v Speaker 4>You know they make Incredible anthills </v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

3193
02:13:31.710 --> 02:13:35.430
<v Speaker 4>monstrous giant constructions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We just assume that it's all natural.</v>

3194
02:13:35.640 --> 02:13:40.640
<v Speaker 4>When,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when human beings act crazy and selfish </v>

3195
02:13:40.640 --> 02:13:44.541
<v Speaker 4>and delusional and fuck up the </v>
<v Speaker 4>environment and war with each other and </v>

3196
02:13:44.541 --> 02:13:47.931
<v Speaker 4>dropping bombs on each other,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we should probably assume that it's </v>

3197
02:13:47.931 --> 02:13:47.931
<v Speaker 4>natural.</v>

3198
02:13:47.931 --> 02:13:49.290
<v Speaker 4>We should probablY assume that this is </v>
<v Speaker 4>a.</v>

3199
02:13:49.291 --> 02:13:52.680
<v Speaker 4>This is what this species does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We just are so cocky.</v>

3200
02:13:52.681 --> 02:13:55.320
<v Speaker 4>We think that we can avoid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Our nature were so cocky.</v>

3201
02:13:55.321 --> 02:13:57.980
<v Speaker 4>We think that we can manipulate our </v>
<v Speaker 4>nature and maybe we can recount.</v>

3202
02:13:57.990 --> 02:14:02.990
<v Speaker 4>That's what I put laws out of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just kind of slows it down.</v>

3203
02:14:03.650 --> 02:14:08.650
<v Speaker 4>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It stops it from being completely </v>

3204
02:14:08.650 --> 02:14:10.821
<v Speaker 4>chaotic and that mean most of the laws </v>
<v Speaker 4>are set up so people can have more fun </v>

3205
02:14:10.821 --> 02:14:15.290
<v Speaker 4>and enjoy more time here and have more </v>
<v Speaker 4>pleasure and less to protect both of </v>

3206
02:14:15.290 --> 02:14:15.290
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3207
02:14:15.290 --> 02:14:15.600
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Less,</v>

3208
02:14:15.601 --> 02:14:16.830
<v Speaker 4>less,</v>
<v Speaker 4>less pain,</v>

3209
02:14:16.831 --> 02:14:21.831
<v Speaker 4>more pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Make this this transient moment feel </v>

3210
02:14:21.831 --> 02:14:22.410
<v Speaker 4>better for the people that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>participating in it,</v>

3211
02:14:22.650 --> 02:14:24.120
<v Speaker 4>but when you get past that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

02:14:24.330 --> 02:14:26.340
<v Speaker 4>what is it?</v>

<v Speaker 4>reasons for it?</v>

3215
02:14:29.940 --> 02:14:32.460
<v Speaker 4>How about corporate corruption?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Never ends 2011.</v>

3216
02:14:32.640 --> 02:14:34.860
<v Speaker 4>This belief,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this $16,000,000,000,000</v>
