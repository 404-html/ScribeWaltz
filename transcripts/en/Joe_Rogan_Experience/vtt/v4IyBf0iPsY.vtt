WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
So this is the first one ever live.
Is it?
It says offline.
Let's see.
Do,

2
00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.100
do,
do,
do,
do.
There's probably a bit of a delay,
right?

3
00:00:08.101 --> 00:00:10.260
Just like youtube or youstream rather.

4
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.420
So starting it says offline to me though.
Say offline.
Do you,

5
00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.420
oh,
here we go.
Something's happening.
I see a spinning wheel.

6
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.330
Proud Mary.
Keep on burning.
Big Wheel.

7
00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:36.070
Keep on turning.
Nope.
Yes.
Success.
Steven Crowder.

8
00:00:36.071 --> 00:00:40.540
You are the first official broadcast streamed live on not a good sign.

9
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.850
It's a great sign.
Why is that bad?
Well,
you're going to turn,
yeah,

10
00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.530
you're gonna get some monsters on youtube.
We'll show you a fag.

11
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.750
Makes appearances quite a bit.
When I appear I'm not Jewish or gay.

12
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.200
Did someone call you?
Would you bag all the time?
Yeah.
Hmm.
Yeah.

13
00:00:53.201 --> 00:00:54.460
You look just funny cause I'm not Jewish or gay.

14
00:00:54.461 --> 00:00:57.130
My brother and I did a video when youtube,
it just started,

15
00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.650
it was 2006 so I don't know if you remember,

16
00:00:59.651 --> 00:01:01.780
was a rash of really bad impression videos.

17
00:01:01.781 --> 00:01:03.910
It would be like I'm going to do a hundred impressions and it was some guy doing

18
00:01:03.911 --> 00:01:06.100
like Kermit the frog.
Cartoons are not impressions,

19
00:01:06.101 --> 00:01:08.230
you're just doing cartoon voices like at a party.

20
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.760
And so I did one where I did these impressions that were really mediocre but my

21
00:01:12.761 --> 00:01:15.580
brother was my ed McMahon and he was just laughing his ass.

22
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.420
He just thought it was hilarious and then it goes on for like five minutes and

23
00:01:19.421 --> 00:01:23.110
then I do a pretty spot on Harrison Ford impression and brothers like you need

24
00:01:23.111 --> 00:01:26.020
it,
you need to work on that one a little bit.
And so we have these,

25
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.370
this is the new youtube was new uncensored and it's like you're a Jew Fag and I

26
00:01:30.371 --> 00:01:33.100
hope you get aids from that Jew fag not realizing he was my brother.

27
00:01:33.101 --> 00:01:36.370
My brother is not Jewish either and that there were people who hated it because

28
00:01:36.371 --> 00:01:37.780
they thought the impressions were awful.

29
00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.080
There were people who hated it cause they got the joke and they felt like they'd

30
00:01:41.081 --> 00:01:44.130
been shortchanged and there were people who liked it because they got the joke

31
00:01:44.131 --> 00:01:46.270
in.
There are people who liked it because for some reason they thought the

32
00:01:46.271 --> 00:01:49.530
impressions were good and they were all fighting and we were calling what?

33
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.840
What is this monsters?
Monsters.
Just it in a monsters,

34
00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.380
but you do realize that you're feeding those monsters by bringing up their

35
00:01:56.381 --> 00:01:58.660
actual ne like saying all that stuff like you,

36
00:01:58.661 --> 00:02:01.360
you're giving them the attention that they so desperately seek.

37
00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.040
Is that like like poltergeist?
Yes.
Eating them like candy man and there's also,

38
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.500
that's a horrible film.
When you go back and watch it at all.

39
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.630
It's like one of those things you watch when you're a kid and you're scared and

40
00:02:13.631 --> 00:02:15.580
you go back.
You're like,
no,
no,
trust me.
Trust me.
Let's watch this.

41
00:02:15.581 --> 00:02:17.740
You watch it with your girlfriend and you just wish you would have left it
there.

42
00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.650
Do you know what the one did?
That to me is altered states.

43
00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.090
I didn't see altered states.

44
00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.330
It was so well those are what got me an isolation tanks.

45
00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.010
I was fascinated by and that's what got me into it and he got me into John
Lilly.

46
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.670
The Guy who was the whole movie was actually based on this one guy,

47
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.280
not obviously,
it didn't really turn into a monkey.

48
00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.040
Do you remember the movie the William Hurt Movie?
I don't remember the film.

49
00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.130
He got ahold of some crazy psychedelic brew from the Amazon Jungle and took it

50
00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.720
and brought it back to America and had these experiences where he regressed into

51
00:02:49.721 --> 00:02:54.721
some monkey beast thing and he went to the zoo or kill a bunch of animals.

52
00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.500
Yeah.
Like he had like the change,
but when you,
you know,

53
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.450
I was watching it was that,
that's the noise.

54
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.200
I mean I probably was like Larry Flynt

55
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.940
trying to push his wheelchair.
Um,

56
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.560
I watched it when I was like 15 or something like that.

57
00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:17.200
It was in high school and I was like,
Whoa,
this is so cool.

58
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.380
When I watched it again when I was like 39 and I was like,
oh,

59
00:03:20.381 --> 00:03:23.830
this is such a piece of shit that happened with me like two weeks ago with my

60
00:03:23.831 --> 00:03:28.060
wife and I feel ashamed Ninja turtles because it was up late.
And I'm on Netflix,

61
00:03:28.061 --> 00:03:30.200
I'm watching Megan Fox and into term,
I said,
this is terrible.

62
00:03:30.201 --> 00:03:30.760
I get you don't know,

63
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.430
you don't know Ninja turtles because there it was at one point,

64
00:03:33.431 --> 00:03:37.780
it was actually a good film and I take her back and I watched it.
I'm like,
well,

65
00:03:37.781 --> 00:03:40.660
maybe let's try new to turtles too.
And it just gets worse.
Well,

66
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.290
you know the shit that's good when you're little and it's still good when you're

67
00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:48.010
little,
but when you're not little,
it's not good.
Like I took my kids to see this.

68
00:03:48.011 --> 00:03:51.670
Uh,
this is a show called wild Kratts.
Yeah,
well I worked with PBS.

69
00:03:51.671 --> 00:03:55.720
They'd come in every now and then.
Oh yeah.
Arthur was mine.
It's a very good show.

70
00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.100
The show is very good.
Like the television show,
the live show is terrible.
Oh,

71
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.580
it's like a museum where you just see a video display kind of deal.

72
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.780
Isn't it like that?
No,
it's worse than that.
It's way worse than that.
It's,

73
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.010
but meanwhile,
my five year old fucking loved it.

74
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.440
Like I took her to see it.
It was a,

75
00:04:11.441 --> 00:04:16.441
at the pantageous in Hollywood and they put on the suits like in the show,

76
00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.340
there's this what,
what the show's about.

77
00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:22.030
It's an educational show for people don't know that it is all about wildlife and

78
00:04:22.031 --> 00:04:25.090
kids learn a lot of stuff,
which to be,
is it booma Fu within,

79
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.930
they know they've heard the jumping on the shirt with the grads brothers and um,

80
00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:34.490
uh,
nothing like an actual Lemur.
No.
Very inaccurate.
Yeah,

81
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.050
they can be aggressive,
actual lemurs keys.
So you know,

82
00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.180
some kid went to the zoo face torn off by a monkey on red wine and Xanax,

83
00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:46.020
but the um,

84
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.990
the show like my five year old learns all kinds of shit from it because like

85
00:04:49.991 --> 00:04:54.010
she'll say,
you know,
Daddy,
did you know that alligators or crocodiles?

86
00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.760
I think it is,

87
00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.570
they decide whether or not they're male or female based on the temperature of

88
00:04:58.571 --> 00:05:02.620
the water.
And I'm like,
fuck,
is that true?
And so I Google it.
I'm like,
Holy Shit.

89
00:05:02.621 --> 00:05:06.910
My Five Year old just schooled me on crocodile.
The gendered assignment.

90
00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.800
I think if we're being honest with ourselves,

91
00:05:08.801 --> 00:05:11.410
your five year old would probably school you on the difference between an

92
00:05:11.411 --> 00:05:13.720
alligator and a crocodile because I'm still murky on it.

93
00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.860
I'm pretty clear on that one.
I forget.
Can I get,
you know,
I was like,
Oh,

94
00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.530
this crocodile,
it goes by the snouts.
One of them is around her.
Yeah,
alligators.

95
00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.830
They don't see,
probably has a lot of respect for the American alligator.

96
00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:26.050
Steve Irwin did.
Yeah,
he was a crocodile hunter,

97
00:05:26.051 --> 00:05:28.660
but I remember when he got around some gators,
he was like,
this is,
don't,

98
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.910
these guys are serious.
Well,
I said,
actually,

99
00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.280
alligators are not nearly as aggressive as crocodiles.

100
00:05:33.281 --> 00:05:36.040
Crocodiles are way more dangerous,
and it was factually inaccurate.

101
00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.230
It's the opposite.
American alligators are smaller or they're,
well,

102
00:05:41.231 --> 00:05:43.730
they're smaller than crocodile,
like Niall Crocs,
but you know,

103
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.520
they've fucking Douche bags.

104
00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:49.600
Some people have released Nile crocodiles in Florida,

105
00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.790
so they found a few of them in the everglades,

106
00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.880
and so they have a seek and destroy mission.

107
00:05:54.881 --> 00:05:57.980
Like if you see a Nile crocodile,
like game wardens,

108
00:05:57.981 --> 00:06:02.550
everyone is supposed to kill an onsite to happen in Michigan was Sosa lamp race.

109
00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.210
You ever seen those?
Yeah,
and actually as a matter of fact,

110
00:06:05.211 --> 00:06:07.070
I think you've done her show,
Dana Lash and her husband,

111
00:06:07.071 --> 00:06:09.860
they were coming up to my wedding up there and he was like,
I'm not,

112
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:10.701
I'm not going up there.

113
00:06:10.701 --> 00:06:12.860
They got lampreys in the light come like they have no sharks,

114
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.350
they have no sting rays.
You have land praise that's a J.
It's scary.

115
00:06:15.351 --> 00:06:19.100
It's got like a mouth full of teeth.
They're cool.
They're like,
yeah,

116
00:06:19.101 --> 00:06:21.110
but they're not pleasant to be in the water with.

117
00:06:21.111 --> 00:06:23.690
But they've exterminated like I think 90 something percent of them.

118
00:06:23.691 --> 00:06:27.380
But it's that 10% that you still have to worry about up there in the Great
Lakes.

119
00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:27.681
Yeah.

120
00:06:27.681 --> 00:06:30.530
Well there's a bunch of invasive species from other countries that they've done

121
00:06:30.531 --> 00:06:33.230
that with those uh,
Asian carp.
That's one of them.
Yeah.

122
00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:34.730
If you haven't seen that folks,

123
00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.240
you got to Google it because it's the craziest fucking thing you could.

124
00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.850
There's a youtube videos for whatever reason.

125
00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.880
When you ride boats they jump out of the water and they have knocked people dead

126
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.720
like knock people out called they jump out of the water.

127
00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.360
He actually died from Asian carp.

128
00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.870
I bet people have died cause I know people have been knocked out cold.
I know,

129
00:06:53.871 --> 00:06:57.780
I know personally.
A lot of weight.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
You're like 30 pounds.

130
00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:00.470
They fucking jumping in the air and make them sharp.
So I'll do that.
You know?

131
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:01.970
Really?
Yeah.
Mako sharks can get,

132
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:04.700
I mean maybe you can bring it up like I want to say 60 miles an hour or

133
00:07:04.701 --> 00:07:08.420
something absurd and they'll go right into boats.
Whoa.
Yeah.
Maaco sharks.

134
00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:12.230
So they just slam into but,
but they don't get on fishing boats.
Yeah,

135
00:07:12.231 --> 00:07:14.840
they'll actually like cause just going so fast and I think they're coming for

136
00:07:14.841 --> 00:07:17.000
the bait.
You can find videos if you bring them up.

137
00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:21.230
Have you ever seen the video of the kayakers that get fucking swamped by the

138
00:07:21.231 --> 00:07:25.160
whale?
The whale breaching.
Read Moby Dick.
Now this is a real one.

139
00:07:25.161 --> 00:07:27.950
This is a real ones.
A real one.
They should get.
See if he can find that.

140
00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.860
The whale a swamp.
Some kayakers.
Yeah.

141
00:07:30.861 --> 00:07:34.070
These fucking poor fools are out in a kayak.
I love whales.

142
00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:37.700
It's amazing to see in this environment when you're around nature,

143
00:07:37.701 --> 00:07:40.900
it just makes you feel so wonderful.
They care about us.
They look,

144
00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:41.870
there's fucking,
well,
I'll just

145
00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:48.780
show these poor fuckers isn't fluid.
Watch this shit.
Is it?

146
00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:53.690
Where did I go this way?
This one.
Anyone either the mat push this.
Oh my gosh.

147
00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:57.110
Kyla,
you fucked up son.
Kill them all.

148
00:07:58.610 --> 00:07:59.960
That's one thing I talked about.

149
00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:04.130
I remember someone really mad in stand up a bit about sharks.
I was like,

150
00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:08.660
let's just sit close of a Jesus fucking Christ.
Oh Gosh.

151
00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:10.760
I mean that's got away.
What?

152
00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:14.270
10,000 pounds a dead or do they just kind of move with it because it's water?

153
00:08:14.271 --> 00:08:16.060
I mean,
if that happened to land your dead.
Yeah,

154
00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:18.860
I would assume they just move with it.
I mean,
they probably got fucked.

155
00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:22.490
The real scary thing is if you get knocked unconscious by the blow and then you

156
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:27.580
go look at,
that's the impact of it.
Oh,
my fucker was a hunchback.

157
00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:30.260
What do we know?
No big.
Oh,
there it looks like they're okay.

158
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:34.610
Have you ever seen wheels from real life?
Oh,
there they are.
The dolphins.
Uh,

159
00:08:34.611 --> 00:08:37.790
I don't think I've seen whales.
I've seen whales.
I went on a,
one of the,

160
00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:41.630
one of the things my daughter had this a school thing where you go over to a

161
00:08:41.631 --> 00:08:44.420
Zuma,
Zuma beach,
like somewhere around November.

162
00:08:44.421 --> 00:08:48.350
I think they start and you don't even believe what you're seeing,
right?

163
00:08:48.351 --> 00:08:51.730
You seem in the Wadi,
like that's a fucking,
that's a real whale.
Yeah.

164
00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:53.580
Like you see them and you're like,
oh my,
well,

165
00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:58.590
I guess it's like when you see them on TV go,
yeah,
they're big.
I get it.

166
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.470
But when you see them in real life and you get a perspective,
you're like,

167
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.980
oh my God,
they're just living out there.
Well,
it's like Lena Dunham.

168
00:09:04.981 --> 00:09:09.480
You see her in the pictures and you know what's bad and then you see her in

169
00:09:09.481 --> 00:09:12.850
context next to someone.
I see what you just see what I did there.

170
00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.840
Case she blocked me quickly without me ever even tweeting her.

171
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:18.750
One thing I will say we were in Florida blocks you because of that video that

172
00:09:18.751 --> 00:09:21.930
you made.
Is that what it was?
No,
she won't me long before that video.
Really.

173
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:24.780
I get blocked by people before I even talked to them.
I do too.

174
00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:28.810
Sometimes I'm proud of it.
Well,
a lot of them are comedians too.
Just comedians.

175
00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:32.700
Black.
You get the fuck out of here.
What comedians and block to Amy Schumer?

176
00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:36.480
Mark Marin.
I never tweeted them.
What?
Same insurance.
I got in an argument,

177
00:09:36.481 --> 00:09:39.360
a on Fox News a long time ago.
No,
about what?

178
00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:43.020
About a column I wrote and we got into it and I was like,
okay.
And I was,

179
00:09:43.021 --> 00:09:45.870
it was actually pretty respectful,
but I,
it happens with a lot of Comedians,

180
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:47.820
a lot of comics.
What was the column about?

181
00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:51.660
The column was about how as a Christian and how I wasn't having sex and wrote

182
00:09:51.661 --> 00:09:55.290
about sort of the case for Christians maybe aren't crazy who wait until they're

183
00:09:55.291 --> 00:09:59.130
married and she's like,
I feel like it's really judgmental and really harsh.

184
00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:00.900
And I was like,
okay,
well that's fine.

185
00:10:00.901 --> 00:10:05.010
This is my case and you don't have to do it.
She got really,
really mad about it.

186
00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:08.700
You know what's interesting is if you are like a tantric Buddhist,

187
00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:10.960
that's exactly what I said.
Yeah,

188
00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:14.010
I talked about that cause and right away off air.
The first thing,

189
00:10:14.011 --> 00:10:17.720
and it's the same thing with with Marin who I,
you know I like,
um,

190
00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:20.670
is well where do you do?
You're not part of our club.
Are you a comedian?

191
00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:22.110
He does that though.

192
00:10:22.111 --> 00:10:26.010
He did that with me and he's got this weird thing we were going to fly.
She goes,

193
00:10:26.011 --> 00:10:27.480
she goes,
well where do you perform standup?

194
00:10:27.481 --> 00:10:30.060
You forming the city and this point I was living in New York.
I was like,
no,

195
00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:33.780
she was woody before.
I'm like,
you're a Christian like churches.
I said,

196
00:10:33.781 --> 00:10:35.700
no actually,
but that sounded like a great idea.

197
00:10:35.701 --> 00:10:38.400
So then after that I started calling up churches like,
do you do stand up?

198
00:10:38.401 --> 00:10:42.540
And there was one that responded.
Yes.
Um,
and then I was,
I was,

199
00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:45.780
they complain and I never did another church again cause I had like,

200
00:10:45.781 --> 00:10:48.120
I had a whole bit about not having sex and the,

201
00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:49.770
I wrote with that it's the final taboo.

202
00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:52.200
Like I can go up and be as profane as possible.
Right.

203
00:10:52.201 --> 00:10:55.350
And I follow comedians or I'll go up and it's filthy and my act is very

204
00:10:55.351 --> 00:10:58.710
politically incorrect.
Like I've been banned from places but it's not dirty.

205
00:10:59.100 --> 00:10:59.431
And I said,

206
00:10:59.431 --> 00:11:02.910
then I go up and talk about not having sex and I won't get so uncomfortable.

207
00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:06.180
The church problem was that I talked about having a raging erection for four

208
00:11:06.181 --> 00:11:09.180
years where my family had to lift the furniture,
like a great Danes tail.

209
00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.720
So the church,
is that a problem with it?
So you,
you did this for years,

210
00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:15.810
he didn't have sex.
Yeah,
for years.
Why did you do that?

211
00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:19.540
Cause I didn't want to be a hypocrite.
And so in what way?
Well,

212
00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:23.160
as someone who is a Christian,
I don't really talk about it a lot,
but I was like,

213
00:11:23.161 --> 00:11:23.994
you know,
and I don't want to be,

214
00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:27.390
I don't want to be a target that easily as far as being a hypocrite and I,

215
00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:29.160
that's why I did it.
So sex,

216
00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:33.940
like there's a lot of really right off the bat.
Yeah.
Because this is a,

217
00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:38.190
it's so,
it's a wacky subject,
you know,
like as a discipline,

218
00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:41.880
like there's some beautiful things about Christianity as a discipline,

219
00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:45.450
but the problem is as a practice,
if you,

220
00:11:45.451 --> 00:11:49.200
if you really pay attention to the scriptures themselves,
it's so problematic.

221
00:11:49.201 --> 00:11:51.900
There's so many contradictions is so much crazy shit in there.

222
00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:55.530
You going on the Old Testament.
Well,
if that's the case,
you're,

223
00:11:55.531 --> 00:11:58.300
you're talking about some really nutty shit.
If you want on the New Testament,

224
00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.310
I want to get off,
I'm going to wells in this right off the bat,

225
00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:01.480
but you know what I'm saying?

226
00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:05.260
I understand what testament mice are created by Constantine.

227
00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:09.300
A bunch of the Canon was really manufacturing.
He wasn't even a Christian.

228
00:12:09.301 --> 00:12:12.070
And here's my,
is on his deathbed.
I don't talk about it a lot.

229
00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:14.710
I'll write about it because it's,
it's a big part of what defines me.

230
00:12:14.711 --> 00:12:16.120
Like we'd Harrison Greenbaum on and you know,

231
00:12:16.121 --> 00:12:18.970
norm Macdonald's Harrison Greenbaum went up and he did this bit about,
you know,

232
00:12:18.971 --> 00:12:23.050
someone read me a scripture from a book,
you know,
on the,
on the bus.
And I said,

233
00:12:23.051 --> 00:12:25.900
well,
if you get to quote your favorite book,
I get 12 mine Harry Potter batch.

234
00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.530
And he came on and he was really Harrison Greenbaum.
He's on last comic standing.

235
00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:34.660
Anyways,
he was on the show.
He claimed,
he said he knew you and they had him on.

236
00:12:34.661 --> 00:12:39.661
He was really mad that I wrote gay comic gets sort of shafted by norm.

237
00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:42.940
And he was like,
he was like,
well,
you know,
first off he used gay pejoratively.

238
00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:47.890
I said,
yes.
He goes,
well,
okay,
so you know what that means?
I said,
sure,

239
00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:51.790
you're a comedian,
right?
Like why is that a problem?
But he goes,
well,
you know,

240
00:12:51.791 --> 00:12:54.010
first of you just didn't use it pejoratively and you didn't even ask me.
I said,

241
00:12:54.011 --> 00:12:58.240
well,
are you gay?
He goes,
no.
Okay.
And I said,
okay,

242
00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:00.040
I'll take your word for it,
but I don't believe you,

243
00:13:00.041 --> 00:13:02.350
but let's just continue with the interview.
And we went out.

244
00:13:02.351 --> 00:13:04.060
And then afterwards I was like,
I was like,
you know,
the fact is,

245
00:13:04.061 --> 00:13:04.990
even if you're not gay,

246
00:13:04.991 --> 00:13:07.720
you make this Christian joke but you don't touch Islam at all.

247
00:13:07.721 --> 00:13:09.040
And I know you claim you're straight,

248
00:13:09.041 --> 00:13:12.400
but they would throw you off a roof for your lisp.
And He,
um,

249
00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:13.690
the thing with norm was he went out,

250
00:13:13.691 --> 00:13:17.260
he did this bit about the Bible and you have Roseanne Barr on last comic

251
00:13:17.261 --> 00:13:19.730
standing.
And my commentary was just the norm said,
you know,

252
00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:20.890
I didn't think it was a,

253
00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:23.410
and I think it was accurate and I didn't think it was funny it up.

254
00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:26.950
And I didn't think it was risky and I thought it was very safe.

255
00:13:26.951 --> 00:13:29.200
And if you're going to sell to the entire group of people who,
you know,

256
00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:31.870
I know about the faith,
you should probably know what you're talking about.

257
00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:36.010
That was it.
Right.
And he was so upset and he was like,
he was going,
well,

258
00:13:36.011 --> 00:13:37.660
the audience is actually booming,
norm.
And I go,
well,

259
00:13:37.661 --> 00:13:39.010
you're missing the point of the piece.

260
00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:42.070
It's that everyone was upset at norm saying that.

261
00:13:42.071 --> 00:13:45.850
And Roseanne Barr's telling her that some Rascii Shat when he'd made a Bible

262
00:13:45.851 --> 00:13:49.500
joke and is pointing out,
it's really not that risky.
Well,
what was the joke?

263
00:13:49.501 --> 00:13:52.480
Do you remember?
What was a quiet guy quoting scripture?
He said,
my favorite.

264
00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:56.920
The Harry Potter batch.
Yeah,
that's something he's not gay.
He's gay as fuck.

265
00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:00.800
If he's,
if he sounds anything like your voice,
it's like,
well this is the one,

266
00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:02.450
can I look at Harrison Greenbaum,

267
00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:05.430
pull them up on the screen and bring up our interview with,

268
00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:09.910
I will tell you by looking,
I have that,
that gift.
That's true.

269
00:14:09.911 --> 00:14:12.850
Got that gift from Jesus.
Wait,
did you look at him?
I can look at,

270
00:14:12.851 --> 00:14:14.170
tell them someone and find out their guy.

271
00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:16.510
Well that's not gay Dar cause that's a gift.

272
00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:21.670
It's a biblical or divine friend.
Uh,
David Pride says that's a homo vision.

273
00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:26.980
Well he should,
he should go on TV and say that this is the guy,
he'll do well.

274
00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:31.780
Okay.
That guy's not game.
Hmm.
We can't go buy a picture.
Yes,
I can just like that.

275
00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:36.930
The sweater with the white shirt.
A nice guy to be

276
00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:39.190
gay.

277
00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:42.430
I don't think there's anything wrong with being good point was he got mad and he

278
00:14:42.431 --> 00:14:46.270
didn't want me to take him out of context.
So I said,
okay,
we'll do a pre tape.

279
00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:47.800
We have to do two segments for Aaron.

280
00:14:47.801 --> 00:14:49.960
We did like a three hour thing on it where I was doing with it.

281
00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:53.690
So where was this interview being held?
Is My show.
Oh,
your show.
Okay.

282
00:14:53.691 --> 00:14:55.840
So he came on your show.
Yeah.
All right.

283
00:14:56.850 --> 00:14:59.510
We're going to slip in a request for you to go on.
You can not say no,

284
00:14:59.511 --> 00:15:03.200
but now I do it.
Sure.
It's um,
we know we go terrestrially actually we're going,

285
00:15:03.201 --> 00:15:05.630
um,
into syndication here with the Alex Jones's.

286
00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:09.260
Same guys at Genesis doesn't mean I agree with Alex and a whole bunch.
But uh,

287
00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:13.400
so we kind of have the show that's syndicated terrestrially and then we do

288
00:15:13.401 --> 00:15:16.280
extended versions for the podcast.
We're kind of bridging that gap.

289
00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:21.260
Well Alex is the exact opposite of you in,
in the sense of,
uh,
Alex is not,

290
00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:24.920
not having sex for any reason whatsoever.
I'm married though.

291
00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:29.060
He's a fucking animal.
He's a crazy dude.
Like people go,

292
00:15:29.061 --> 00:15:30.680
why are you friends with I was John's.
I go,

293
00:15:30.681 --> 00:15:33.110
I'm friends with Alex Jones Cause I'm friends with Alex Jones.

294
00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:36.890
What you're getting,
it's Alex Jones on Info wars.com.

295
00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:40.550
What they're doing right now,
take away life.

296
00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:43.850
They want to wipe out America.
You know,
he,
he's,

297
00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:46.910
he's gonna do impressions in your act or do you find it hard to bring them in?

298
00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:49.610
I very rarely do it.
Feels hacked to bring them in and stand up.

299
00:15:49.611 --> 00:15:53.210
Usually it doesn't it,
well,
unless it's,
there's a reason to do it.
Like if I,

300
00:15:53.211 --> 00:15:54.950
if I have to do a Mike Tyson bit,

301
00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:58.430
if there's something happens and Mike Tyson and I've got a bit that does it.

302
00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:02.420
Well you saw it from like 1991 there's something that's online but it,

303
00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:05.970
there's a reason to do a voice.
I'll do it.
Right.

304
00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:09.170
You're like if I had a bill Cosby bed,
do bill Cosby's voice.

305
00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:11.690
We do what we do on the podcast.
So we do fake commercials.

306
00:16:11.691 --> 00:16:13.340
We like dating advice with Bill Cosby,

307
00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:16.460
minute news minute with the in a nick of time with Nick Nolte d.

308
00:16:16.461 --> 00:16:18.290
So it's like the Internet is actually,

309
00:16:18.291 --> 00:16:20.480
it's funny we were talking about this when stand up,
I started standing,

310
00:16:20.481 --> 00:16:23.960
I started acting actually when I was 12 and then I did stand up because the

311
00:16:23.961 --> 00:16:25.520
unions killed the industry in Montreal.

312
00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:28.160
There was just no more film coming into the city.
You know,

313
00:16:28.161 --> 00:16:30.350
they used to shoot a ton of stuff in Montreal.
Now not so much.

314
00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:33.560
And so I was in my teens and I had been writing standup for years for like

315
00:16:33.561 --> 00:16:34.520
school talent shows.
Like,

316
00:16:34.521 --> 00:16:37.790
I think this would be funny because I grew up around it and I thought it was so

317
00:16:37.791 --> 00:16:38.870
freeing to do it.

318
00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:42.800
And then it's kind of turned like you were talking about this PC culture where I

319
00:16:42.801 --> 00:16:45.700
think,
and I was sort of wrong in a sense,
I was like,
these kids online,

320
00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:47.480
they're not,
they're not comedians.
They don't know what it's like.

321
00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:48.830
But I think about it,
you know,

322
00:16:48.831 --> 00:16:50.650
that's what the Marx brothers would have set of standup.

323
00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:54.140
It's just an evolution of comedy and you can't do stand up in your bedroom,

324
00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:57.950
but you can do youtube and your bedroom.
And so you look like at at Nicole Arbor,

325
00:16:57.951 --> 00:17:00.340
this thing,
I don't know if you saw she was,
did the fat shaming thing.

326
00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:02.660
I did see the,
and I didn't think was prickly funny,

327
00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:03.920
but I defended the right to say it,

328
00:17:03.921 --> 00:17:07.370
but I was saying it doesn't matter if she's funny or not because people will

329
00:17:07.371 --> 00:17:10.790
always attack you for not being funny.
I'm not going to say that's offensive.

330
00:17:10.791 --> 00:17:12.890
You can't say it.
They'll say,
well,
I just,
you're just not funny.

331
00:17:12.891 --> 00:17:15.950
So you shouldn't be able to say that.
And a PC,
you know,

332
00:17:15.951 --> 00:17:18.950
the PC culture has really permeated,
stand up in a way that's,
I mean,

333
00:17:18.951 --> 00:17:21.010
it happened in Canada years ago.
Yeah.

334
00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:23.030
It's freedom of speech doesn't really exist in Canada.

335
00:17:23.031 --> 00:17:24.920
It's not a legally protected,
right.
Well,

336
00:17:24.921 --> 00:17:29.921
you know about the guy in Vancouver who literally got sued and lost because he

337
00:17:30.531 --> 00:17:34.820
had some woman heckling him and he said a bunch of mean shit to her.
And so he,

338
00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:39.940
whatever human rights violation,
I forget what the actual citation was.
Yeah.

339
00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:44.420
But he has to pay like $15,000.
Well,
there's a pastor Steven blossom who,
um,

340
00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:48.080
said he wouldn't marry two guys and spoke out against it and it wasn't hateful.

341
00:17:48.081 --> 00:17:51.400
You know,
everyone loves to paint pastors to southern preop am Hamas.
Right.

342
00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:54.100
And he was just like,
well listen,
that's not going to happen to my church.
And um,

343
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:57.840
he was actually banned from public speaking losses.
Church had to file an appeal.

344
00:17:58.290 --> 00:18:00.210
And so that's where,
when I talk with people about it,
you know,

345
00:18:00.211 --> 00:18:04.690
I think it was sent from public speaking by saying that he doesn't want to marry

346
00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:07.830
gate and saying it's still against gods.
You know,
whatever his deal is,

347
00:18:07.831 --> 00:18:09.870
what do you agree with it or not?
That's my point.

348
00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:14.130
It's still not okay to ban a guy from even having a church.
I mean,

349
00:18:14.131 --> 00:18:18.360
Westboro Baptists have 12 people,
nine of whom are the guy's family.

350
00:18:18.361 --> 00:18:19.950
They get so much press time.
Meanwhile,

351
00:18:19.951 --> 00:18:23.370
we have over 300 million Muslims who want you to die for converting,

352
00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:26.910
and we're talking about the Westboro Baptist because they use the f word.

353
00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:33.560
It's fun reasons why the Westboro Baptist Church means that Guy Phelps was so

354
00:18:33.721 --> 00:18:36.260
fucking nuts.
He was so out of it.

355
00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:39.920
Did you ever see the the Louis Theroux documentaries where they ask if he's

356
00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:44.130
Jewish?
He's like,
well,
I don't think it should matter,
but are you do,

357
00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:47.610
I'm not saying I'm,
I'm,
I am Jewish,
but I don't understand why that should,

358
00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:52.680
that's not relevant.
Are you Jew?
That was all,
it was like the guy on youtube,

359
00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:56.340
that kind of student Brazilian Jiu Jitsu do remember that.
I don't remember that.

360
00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:59.490
The white supremacists,
why do I not remember?

361
00:18:59.491 --> 00:19:02.240
They were training in Brazilian Jujitsu and I was like,
do you not see fee?

362
00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:08.810
They were training MMA,
Brazilian Jujitsu,
the the,
we know,
wait,

363
00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:11.980
no,
I'm thinking of a different one with through on white supremacists.
Oh,

364
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:13.680
let me get a white supremacist.

365
00:19:13.681 --> 00:19:16.530
While I didn't see that and they were like training up their gang and they were

366
00:19:16.531 --> 00:19:19.740
doing Brazilian Jujitsu that well that's pretty ironic.

367
00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:22.850
I Brazilians are not white.
You fuck,
well they kind of are.
Some of them are,

368
00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:25.800
but they're the most racist people on the planet.
Brazilians.
Oh my God.

369
00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:27.210
Well I wouldn't say they're racist.

370
00:19:27.211 --> 00:19:30.750
What I would say is that they're nationalistic,
they're very nationalistic,

371
00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:32.160
but they're,

372
00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:35.640
but they're not in the sense because there's like half the country is black,

373
00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:40.290
like half the country is,
is like well can,
I don't know if you really sort of,

374
00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:42.800
not to get into your wheelhouse,
but like the,
the,

375
00:19:42.801 --> 00:19:44.520
the tour Belfour Anderson Silva thing.

376
00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:47.070
If you look at a lot of the stuff like in the Brazilian message boards that

377
00:19:47.071 --> 00:19:47.904
people were saying,

378
00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:53.090
it was really like this short of coming up of this black class in Brazil where

379
00:19:53.401 --> 00:19:55.140
if you were black,
you worked at Mcdonald's,

380
00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:58.080
you just weren't considered a first class citizen among a lot of the pure

381
00:19:58.081 --> 00:20:02.730
Brazilians and people don't understand about Che Guevara in the,
in,
um,
Cuba,

382
00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:05.460
same kind of thing.
You know,
I saw a kid wearing a chicken bear shirt.
I go,
well,

383
00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:07.560
let me just,
where Hitler shirt or what do you mean?

384
00:20:07.561 --> 00:20:12.561
He believed in pure European Spanish blood and executed people for not being

385
00:20:13.231 --> 00:20:16.580
that,
um,
and uh,
in Brazil to really is a class structure.
I mean,

386
00:20:16.581 --> 00:20:17.760
my Brazilian instructor,

387
00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:21.900
I won't say who I've had several was quite racist and he's like,
oh man,

388
00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:25.860
he ain't America.
You could play 45.
The Guy,
he's,
he's white.

389
00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:29.490
You black in Brasil,
he's not even give time of day.
He was,

390
00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:33.120
that's weird because shock ray is like a Brazilian national hero and he's black,

391
00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:36.030
but they're out pay rates.
What about Palae?
The soccer player.

392
00:20:36.031 --> 00:20:39.160
He was a Brazilian national hero.
He was black.
And my evidence is anecdotal,
Joe.

393
00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:43.840
Oh No.
Yeah,
no it is true.
I've been to Brazil many times.
They're free.

394
00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:47.290
I just don't see that.
I mean I might be wrong,
you know there was a,

395
00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:51.040
there was a huge issue with Anderson Silva when he flipped Damien Maia.
Yeah.

396
00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:55.480
And you know,
and he was a sort of bores was he class?
Damien had college,

397
00:20:55.481 --> 00:21:00.250
he would call the order.
Playboy.
Playboy is like one of the ways that they,
they,

398
00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:04.090
that's the majority of the use for rich privileged white people.
Right.
You know,

399
00:21:04.091 --> 00:21:06.730
playboy,
check your privilege.

400
00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:13.540
Check my friend,
my friend check for you.
I don't know.
I would have to,

401
00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:18.130
I'd never actually asked my Brazilian friends whether or not Brazil's racist,

402
00:21:18.131 --> 00:21:21.850
but I didn't experience it that much when I was there.
They'd seem real friendly.

403
00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:22.571
It's a very,

404
00:21:22.571 --> 00:21:27.571
very friendly country other than the broken stuff that helps to understand like,

405
00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:32.680
like,
you know,
success has changed how people treat.
You're very successful.

406
00:21:32.681 --> 00:21:35.800
You're a victim of your own success in a sense.
There's a sense I came in here,

407
00:21:35.801 --> 00:21:39.130
nervous.
Well they also know that I'm a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt.
So I,

408
00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:41.330
I practice Brazilian arts.

409
00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:47.190
Big Deep respect for Brazil Groin and then big deep respect for of course the

410
00:21:47.741 --> 00:21:52.080
Gracie family mean I'm wearing a fucking crazy.
The Gracie family.
We

411
00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:58.470
thank you
Harry Potter batch.
Um,

412
00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:02.470
it is weird though that like there's not a straight voice,
you know,

413
00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:05.200
but there's a gay voice.
Yeah.
And what's so fun?

414
00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:09.790
It's like you say that my wife had a friend,
I won't talk about it.
Talk about it.

415
00:22:09.791 --> 00:22:12.880
You don't have to name names.
Who was clearly gay?
Oh,

416
00:22:12.881 --> 00:22:16.900
I got and got to the point where when he was gone I would call them gay blank

417
00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:20.620
because I know it's such a common name.
My wife was just free.

418
00:22:20.621 --> 00:22:23.530
I'm going to get a text right now so she'd be like,
I was out with so and so on,

419
00:22:23.531 --> 00:22:26.100
but gay so and so,
cause I know five of them,
you know,
it's just like,

420
00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:30.520
it's like a name like John.
It's not John,
but he's not gay.

421
00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:34.930
Okay.
First off,
I said,
let,
let me,
let me clarify the rules.
If he's not gay,

422
00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:39.730
you can't go out with him alone until one in the morning.
Okay,
he's gay.

423
00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:43.570
And I'd be like,
that was so at many,
sure enough,

424
00:22:43.571 --> 00:22:46.900
he like came out of the closet was shocker.
Well here's the thing,

425
00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:47.770
when a guy like that,

426
00:22:47.771 --> 00:22:50.860
and I mean literally like he's the kind of gay guy who literally like Richard

427
00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:55.120
Simmons would be like,
well that's kind of severe,
like really gay.
And um,

428
00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:57.670
when he came out of the closet,
I told my wife,
I said,
okay,

429
00:22:57.671 --> 00:23:01.750
here's what's going on.
What he's really saying is,
stuff's about to get weird.

430
00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:05.560
You're going to find some grinder profiles.
Like,
cause everyone knew he was gay,

431
00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:06.070
right.

432
00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:09.760
And then all of a sudden it's just a revolving door of boyfriends and it's like,

433
00:23:09.761 --> 00:23:11.410
it's more uncomfortable for my wife.

434
00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:15.850
It's more comfortable for me because I had to keep this lie alive.
Like,
Hey,

435
00:23:15.851 --> 00:23:20.560
you go on any dates with females lately?
Gay Black like now,

436
00:23:20.561 --> 00:23:24.520
you know,
and he dated a girl for a while and I remember just sitting there like,

437
00:23:24.521 --> 00:23:25.750
what bunny hole it,

438
00:23:25.751 --> 00:23:30.751
I jump into where I'm sitting at dinner with my wife and gay blank with his girl

439
00:23:31.121 --> 00:23:33.370
and they're clearly just faking it.
And I was like,

440
00:23:33.371 --> 00:23:36.340
I just wrapped the girl faking it or what did she think that maybe he was

441
00:23:36.341 --> 00:23:40.660
straight or question?
I have a friend,
my friend Shane,
Natasha,
a standup comedian.

442
00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:45.070
She's married,
not one but two different guys that turned out to be gay.

443
00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:49.310
Like she married at a certain point.
It's you.
Well,
I don't know if it's her.

444
00:23:49.311 --> 00:23:52.790
I mean,
I don't know what the fuck is.
She seemed so normal though.
I mean,

445
00:23:52.791 --> 00:23:56.510
she's a comic.
She's Kinda crazy.
But she's nice.
She's,

446
00:23:56.540 --> 00:24:00.560
she seems totally normal.
I have not met him.
I talked to stable female comedians.

447
00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:05.390
I know a few.
Well,
it's weird because it's like in my world,

448
00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:09.230
you know,
like in my world,
in the world of stand up in my world,
sunny,

449
00:24:09.231 --> 00:24:13.470
my patriarchal world,
the sun sets on the west and rises in the Eaton.

450
00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:18.170
It's actually,
does that right?
Yeah,
I reverted back.
Yeah,

451
00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:22.610
it was accurate.
My world's boring frankly.

452
00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:27.110
But the world of standup comics,
it's like there's,
it's a fraternity,
you know,

453
00:24:27.111 --> 00:24:29.840
so like I'm friends with girls who are open Micros,

454
00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:32.600
I'm friends with like especially from kill Tony,

455
00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:35.030
which is a one of my friend red band.
And um,

456
00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:40.060
Tony Hinchcliffe shows where we constantly around these open miker kids that are

457
00:24:40.581 --> 00:24:42.000
coming up and you know,

458
00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:44.510
we've become friends with them and a lot of them are out of their fucking mind.

459
00:24:44.511 --> 00:24:48.680
They're crazy,
but they're friends.
You know,
in my world,
those are ditches.

460
00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:51.860
That's just the mindset that it takes to be a comedian.

461
00:24:51.861 --> 00:24:54.470
You have to be a little bit fucking crazy.
Yeah.
I think that's true.

462
00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:55.431
There's just thing.
So,

463
00:24:55.431 --> 00:24:59.810
so Shayma is no different than any of my other friends in that sense.

464
00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:02.360
But somehow or another,
she wound up with two fucking gay guys.

465
00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:03.680
And the last time I talked to her,

466
00:25:03.681 --> 00:25:05.630
I don't think that story goes somehow or another.

467
00:25:05.631 --> 00:25:09.620
I think there's a reason and they need her mind.
It's somehow or another,

468
00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:13.810
she's like,
what the fuck?
But you know,
she's dated straight guys.
She didn't,

469
00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:16.460
one of my buddies,
I mean she,
you know,
it's not that,

470
00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:18.440
I don't know what the fuck it is,
but she did it.

471
00:25:18.441 --> 00:25:22.910
One guy and then she found out somehow and I think he was gay and then she did

472
00:25:22.911 --> 00:25:25.670
it.
Another guy that was like a male stripper I think.

473
00:25:25.671 --> 00:25:27.710
And somehow or another he was doing with,
there you go.

474
00:25:27.711 --> 00:25:30.350
It's kind of like the talent pool with college sports.

475
00:25:30.351 --> 00:25:32.120
You're picking the guy with the highest vertical.

476
00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:35.870
She's drawn from the pool of the male strippers and the guys who are,
you know,

477
00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:39.560
pay for gay bodybuilders.
That's what's going to happen.
Hey,
for a gay bar,

478
00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:44.520
Gay for pay,
they say,
well it depends on who's doing the pain.
Got called.

479
00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:48.200
He's the one who's paying for the gay.
Is that true?
I have no idea.

480
00:25:48.201 --> 00:25:50.150
It was going to want to be slandered.
Please.
That what you heard?

481
00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:54.240
You heard Joe Wieder paid Arnold?
I didn't hear that.
I knew that.

482
00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:58.490
I heard that Arnold.
I could've been [inaudible] shit back in the day.

483
00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:01.550
I could be completely off base.
Well,
I've talked about it on the podcast.

484
00:26:01.551 --> 00:26:06.410
I had a buddy who was a male stripper,
two buddies,
but way back in the day.

485
00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:10.370
And uh,
you know,
where these uh,
underwear that was like a,

486
00:26:10.371 --> 00:26:12.130
it was a like a,
um,

487
00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:16.480
an elephant underwear and he put his hog and the trunk and even now you combine

488
00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:21.200
your hog with elephant is one animal,
another.
It's actually like a delicacy.

489
00:26:21.201 --> 00:26:23.210
Really.
The guy was really fucking weird.

490
00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:27.470
But then one day and just talking about all these girls that he's dancing for

491
00:26:27.471 --> 00:26:29.030
and I go,
you ever have to dance for guys?

492
00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:31.910
And this is fucking silence in the room.

493
00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:35.680
And everybody's asking why he wants to keep alive.
He said it,

494
00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:39.470
he asked the question and then check out weird when you started explaining how

495
00:26:39.471 --> 00:26:42.560
he had to sometimes,
but he hated it.
And you're like,
when I moved to La,

496
00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:47.790
there was a rope,
there was work and it was cleaning.
I was,
when I moved to La,

497
00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:51.330
I was talking.
Yeah,
Tony Camacho was my manager.
And,
um,

498
00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:53.100
I was living out of a car for a bit.

499
00:26:53.101 --> 00:26:54.440
And when I say it's Kinda like the Ronda Rousey,

500
00:26:54.441 --> 00:26:57.330
it was like a week and I was just sort of couch surfing until I got to my next

501
00:26:57.331 --> 00:26:59.770
place.
So it's not like I was a longtime Hobo.
Right.

502
00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:03.810
And actually got a 24 hour fitness pass for like a week,
so I was fine.

503
00:27:04.610 --> 00:27:08.770
Um,
I don't even know how I was getting started.
Something about,
Oh yeah,

504
00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:09.720
there was a role in,
in,
in,

505
00:27:09.721 --> 00:27:13.520
in craigslist and it was like cleaning houses in your underwear of this.

506
00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:16.700
It was like no contact,
but you're just cleaning houses and your underwear.

507
00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:20.280
It's like 150 bucks an hour or something like that.
Like,
no,
no wait,

508
00:27:20.281 --> 00:27:23.870
it was $50 an hour for a minimum of three hour pay because it is assumed,

509
00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:27.840
you know,
I lost something under the couch.
Yes.
Well my dad had that,

510
00:27:27.841 --> 00:27:31.380
he mowed lawns and the guy at an Indian village in Detroit and he would,

511
00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:35.010
my dad could maybe text me the name of this guy and he said,
the guy was like,

512
00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:38.250
but he wasn't flamboyantly gay.
He was very polite.
He was like,
well,
you know,

513
00:27:38.251 --> 00:27:41.290
Darren,
you're a good looking young man.
You and your brother Dean,
you should,
uh,

514
00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:43.480
as you move along,
you know,
feel free.
It's,

515
00:27:43.481 --> 00:27:46.740
it's hot here in the summer to take off your shirts and wear something a little

516
00:27:46.741 --> 00:27:48.640
bit shorter.
And,
uh,
it's,
it's entirely,
you know,

517
00:27:48.641 --> 00:27:52.500
if you want to take a dip in the pool,
go ahead.
Oh boy.
But he was very,
very nice.

518
00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:55.590
They had a light longterm partner and uh,
you know,

519
00:27:55.591 --> 00:27:57.660
I think a lot of them got massacred in Detroit.

520
00:27:57.661 --> 00:28:00.810
I don't think they live in that area anymore.
Really massacred.
Well,

521
00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:03.120
I just mean Detroit.
It's a war zone there Indians,

522
00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:06.990
some sort of fucking native American war.

523
00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:11.710
He came over together,
indigenous,
Ken,
sandy and anymore.
Is that a no,

524
00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:13.110
you can only can't say Indian.

525
00:28:13.111 --> 00:28:16.860
We moved on the native American and now we moved on to indigenous.
Hmm.
Well,

526
00:28:16.861 --> 00:28:20.430
in Canada it's Digitas,
right?
First nation.
So they say,

527
00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:24.360
I don't know what they st they say for I left Canada.
Well,
it used to be you.

528
00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:28.260
Well,
everybody called people ask them all and then,
no,
you can't do that.

529
00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:33.270
You can't.
But in Alaska,
they use the word Eskimo.
Like it's okay.
Alaska.

530
00:28:33.271 --> 00:28:36.990
It's okay.
It's weird.
This is the problem with a lexicon and the changing rules.

531
00:28:37.050 --> 00:28:40.380
Well,
it's when people get ultra super fucking sensitive and shit gets weird.

532
00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:43.530
Like there's things that used to say for the longest time and now you can't say

533
00:28:43.531 --> 00:28:47.470
him anymore.
Yeah.
Well,
and that's where,
you know,
you're more in the middle.
Uh,

534
00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:51.780
I'm,
you know,
people would say to the right of Attila the Hun,
like Libertarian,

535
00:28:51.781 --> 00:28:56.370
conservative.
Um,
and that's by design.
That's,
that's not an accident.

536
00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:58.050
People want to control language.

537
00:28:58.051 --> 00:28:59.790
If you look at the history of political correctness,

538
00:28:59.791 --> 00:29:03.870
it is designed as a political tool.
And I see these people awakening now,

539
00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:06.120
like the social justice warrior left.
Well,

540
00:29:06.121 --> 00:29:08.700
all they're doing is doing the same thing to,
maybe they're not doing it to you,

541
00:29:08.701 --> 00:29:11.160
but the people like Milo to people out there who are liberal,

542
00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:14.040
the same thing they've done to me and every conservative for a long time.

543
00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:17.610
You're a racist.
You're a sexist.
Perfect example is Ben Carson.

544
00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:20.160
You may not like him.
People may not like them,
right.

545
00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:23.850
But Ben Carson was a neurosurgeon but not just in neuro.
So the best,

546
00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:26.580
he was a fucking wizard and um,

547
00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:29.730
he's probably the most polite candidate we've had in 40 years.

548
00:29:29.731 --> 00:29:32.910
I don't think anyone would dispute that.
He's a very polite guy.
What do they do?

549
00:29:33.090 --> 00:29:37.230
They paint him as a dumb ass bigot.
Well he believes some crazy shit.

550
00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:40.830
Some crazy stuff.
Yeah.
But I would hope that people afford him.
You know,

551
00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:43.990
for example,
like my dad is Christian conservative,
right?

552
00:29:44.290 --> 00:29:47.800
But he sends your stuff along and now he could easily be like,
ah,
you know,
he,

553
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:50.170
it'll just tell them like us get through the edible mushrooms stuff and the

554
00:29:50.171 --> 00:29:52.600
tattoos cause doesn't agree with it.
But like Joe is really right on this,

555
00:29:52.601 --> 00:29:53.261
the part about,

556
00:29:53.261 --> 00:29:56.320
about dying to the ego everyday in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and I'll send it along to

557
00:29:56.321 --> 00:29:59.890
people that this is really inspirational for in my family.

558
00:29:59.891 --> 00:30:02.860
We've never had to paint someone as an idiot because of some opinions with which

559
00:30:02.861 --> 00:30:06.220
we don't agree.
You may think Ben Carson believes some crazy stuff,

560
00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:09.880
but he's a smart guy and he's not a bigot.
Well,

561
00:30:09.881 --> 00:30:14.080
what I find fascinating about him is the people that do compartmentalize certain

562
00:30:14.081 --> 00:30:15.550
aspects of life like that.

563
00:30:15.551 --> 00:30:20.200
He does ignore science when it comes to evolution and he believes in macro

564
00:30:20.201 --> 00:30:22.570
evolution,
but it doesn't believe in micro evolution.

565
00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:24.710
I believe the other way around.
Micro but not macro.

566
00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:28.900
But he's got some interesting ideas about what he believes in,

567
00:30:28.901 --> 00:30:32.740
what he doesn't believe in that the world of science accepts as a,
as a state.

568
00:30:32.741 --> 00:30:35.410
In fact,
the people that are,

569
00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:37.990
but I know a lot of people say,
oh,

570
00:30:37.991 --> 00:30:41.560
he's this 6,000 year old young Earth creationist,
you know,
and they,
and he said,

571
00:30:41.561 --> 00:30:42.260
no,
I'm not.

572
00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:45.010
He just said he has flaws in the big bang and he believes in a big bang.

573
00:30:45.011 --> 00:30:47.410
Just a very different version of it.
Well,
the big bag,

574
00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:50.830
but I don't think some guy in a reddit thread in his mother's basement with a

575
00:30:50.831 --> 00:30:53.690
bag of Cheetos has figured something out that Ben Carson has it.

576
00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:55.690
You asked me about like the Christian thing.
Well,
you just,

577
00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:59.700
you just diminished a person from reddit.
He just put them in the basement.

578
00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:02.680
I met her parents.
Maybe they have a nice apartment.
Well you get some of those,

579
00:31:02.681 --> 00:31:05.560
you get a weird intersection here cause you get smart people who listened to

580
00:31:05.561 --> 00:31:09.680
your show,
but you do get some close minded people and you,
um,

581
00:31:10.330 --> 00:31:11.163
my thing is,

582
00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:13.720
you know what the reason I don't talk about faith or like Donald Trump,

583
00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:16.060
it's because there are certain things or people just,

584
00:31:16.061 --> 00:31:17.260
they're just not going to hear it.

585
00:31:17.261 --> 00:31:20.350
Here's my position on religion and atheism and I don't think it's an untenable

586
00:31:20.351 --> 00:31:22.180
position.
And it's pretty simple.

587
00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:25.150
I believe there are very smart atheists and I believe that there are some very

588
00:31:25.151 --> 00:31:28.030
smart Christians that's undeniable.
It's undeniable.
Yeah.

589
00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:31.630
But the thing is now the reason atheists are so fun to tease and get them up in

590
00:31:31.631 --> 00:31:31.961
a lab,

591
00:31:31.961 --> 00:31:34.990
there's because they think that all of these brilliant people and 3 billion

592
00:31:34.991 --> 00:31:39.040
people in the face of the earth have missed something that they caught because

593
00:31:39.041 --> 00:31:41.080
they saw a half of a Christopher Hitchens debate.

594
00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:42.880
And if you sit down with Ben Carson,

595
00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:45.280
these kids calling him an idiot and talking about he doesn't know science,

596
00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:49.090
they would sit down and he probably school them.
They may not agree with him,

597
00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:52.690
but he probably schooled them and my promise taking things out of context,

598
00:31:52.691 --> 00:31:53.590
like he's not even my guy.

599
00:31:53.650 --> 00:31:58.120
What you see the problem is you're talking about Ben Carson versus some kids

600
00:31:58.270 --> 00:31:59.620
that don't know what they're talking about,

601
00:31:59.621 --> 00:32:02.070
but if you talk Bernie Sanders or Hillary or a mountain,

602
00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:05.620
but what they're comparing Ben Carson to is people that do know what they're

603
00:32:05.621 --> 00:32:06.250
talking about.

604
00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:10.600
So if you do get people that have a vast understanding of evolution and they sit

605
00:32:10.601 --> 00:32:14.080
down and debate Ben Carson,
he's not going to do very well.
I don't know.

606
00:32:14.081 --> 00:32:16.360
I've not seen it.
I think that I would think probably not,

607
00:32:16.361 --> 00:32:18.190
but I don't think he would put himself in that position.

608
00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:20.950
The Big Bang is the weird one because the big bang,

609
00:32:21.010 --> 00:32:24.530
essentially the no one understands why it happened.
Right.

610
00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:26.560
One understands what caused it.

611
00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:30.490
No one understands if it's just some cycle that goes on every 14 billion years.

612
00:32:30.491 --> 00:32:33.130
Writing a book on it.
Who is Ben Carson on the Big Bang,

613
00:32:33.670 --> 00:32:37.540
unexplained his reasoning.
Oh,
that's interesting.
Well,
what is his reasoning?

614
00:32:37.570 --> 00:32:40.390
Do you know what his position is?
I don't know if anyone's position is.

615
00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:42.260
It doesn't.
It's not.
It doesn't reflect my position,

616
00:32:42.261 --> 00:32:46.310
but I don't think that that disqualifies him from being a better leader than a

617
00:32:46.311 --> 00:32:49.370
lot of people in the docket.
I mean,
did you voice of the Bates last night?
No,

618
00:32:49.371 --> 00:32:50.204
I did not.

619
00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:54.620
There was literally a point where all the biggest argument,

620
00:32:54.650 --> 00:32:57.230
and that's the thing that I have,
if you look at the right,
I mean,

621
00:32:57.231 --> 00:32:57.801
you're moderate,

622
00:32:57.801 --> 00:33:00.320
you would be considered to any leftist if you said the stuff they say,

623
00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:02.690
they'd be like,
Oh,
you're right wing.
That's what they would say.
Not You.

624
00:33:02.691 --> 00:33:03.560
That's what they would say.

625
00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:07.310
Let's compare really quickly right now the GOP right people.

626
00:33:07.311 --> 00:33:10.760
It's a party of old white guys.
Okay.
You've got Carly Fiorina,

627
00:33:10.761 --> 00:33:12.980
you've got to Latino's and Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio.

628
00:33:12.981 --> 00:33:17.360
You've got a brain surgeries,
barely Latino.
How dare you?
He's gay by the way.

629
00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:19.970
Tech.
Sure.
100%.
Um,

630
00:33:20.270 --> 00:33:23.090
he also was probably one of the smartest students to come out of Harvard from

631
00:33:23.091 --> 00:33:26.020
according to his professor.
It was an Iq that's like higher the Mexican wall.

632
00:33:26.021 --> 00:33:30.450
So they say that that must be it.
So it happened that in chem trails,
um,

633
00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:34.850
I think,
uh,
so you have them Ben Carson,
yet people are career politicians.

634
00:33:34.851 --> 00:33:36.890
You have people with no experience in the political sector.

635
00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:41.750
And then I'm watching last night,
Hillary Clinton,
Bernie Sanders,
O'Malley,

636
00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:45.530
and a couple of other scrubs.
Every single one is an old white politician.

637
00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:49.730
And the worst part is the lack of intellectual diversity.
Look at the GOP debate.

638
00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:51.430
You have rand Paul who's a non-interventionist.

639
00:33:51.650 --> 00:33:53.510
Basically he was all about that cannabis soil.

640
00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:56.330
You have Chris Christie who basically wants to prosecute using drugs.

641
00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:58.700
You have Carly Fiorina who believes it's a states' right.

642
00:33:58.910 --> 00:34:00.410
You have some people who supported the war in Iraq.

643
00:34:00.411 --> 00:34:01.370
You have some people who were against it.

644
00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:06.020
Every single question last night at that democratic debate was answered in

645
00:34:06.021 --> 00:34:10.310
unison and the biggest argument was over who had the lowest rating from the NRA.

646
00:34:10.490 --> 00:34:11.870
They were attacking Bernie Sanders going,

647
00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:14.840
keep in mind you only have a d minus from the NRA.
I got an f.

648
00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:18.380
Is that really what they were arguing about?
Who?
Who said that?

649
00:34:18.410 --> 00:34:22.040
Who was it was O'Malley Sanders and all of them were arguing over who got the

650
00:34:22.041 --> 00:34:25.640
lowest rating of the NRA.
That was their badge of honor.
You only got a d minus.

651
00:34:25.641 --> 00:34:28.490
I'll go to Uf.
I was like,
what is this?

652
00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:31.490
That's interesting because I did see an interview.

653
00:34:31.491 --> 00:34:34.400
I wanted to get to the debate later today.
I didn't watch it yesterday.

654
00:34:34.430 --> 00:34:38.830
I had some stuff I had to do that was actually important.
But um,

655
00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:41.060
Bernie Sanders,
they feel very poor.
Let's talk,

656
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:44.040
just joking around because I don't,
I don't look,
there's,

657
00:34:44.041 --> 00:34:46.820
this is a real problem with the commission for presidential debates,

658
00:34:46.850 --> 00:34:48.470
real PR problem with the fact that it's,

659
00:34:48.830 --> 00:34:50.870
when it gets down to the big crunch time,

660
00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:54.500
the commission for presidential debates is a privately funded institution.

661
00:34:54.740 --> 00:34:59.060
It's not as simple as like everyone who's running for president gets an equal

662
00:34:59.061 --> 00:35:02.330
say and we have all these qualified candidates and we're just going to figure

663
00:35:02.331 --> 00:35:03.500
out whose the right guy for the job.

664
00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:07.610
It takes a shit load of money to get to the point where you can actually run for

665
00:35:07.611 --> 00:35:12.080
debate when you actually can get up there and actually have your opinion and

666
00:35:12.081 --> 00:35:13.280
broadcast it to the world.

667
00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:16.670
There's a lot of fucking hoops you have to jump through probably rightly so,

668
00:35:17.090 --> 00:35:18.570
but there's some value in that,

669
00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:23.000
but I think that as time moves on and the medium of the Internet becomes more

670
00:35:23.001 --> 00:35:26.810
and more powerful,
most likely that will be less of a factor.

671
00:35:26.811 --> 00:35:28.880
Having Anderson Cooper was goofy glasses,

672
00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:32.270
asking questions about whether or not it's okay to be a conscientious objector

673
00:35:32.271 --> 00:35:33.320
and still run for president,

674
00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:36.170
which is one of the things that apparently he has Bernie Sanders.

675
00:35:36.210 --> 00:35:38.800
I thought it was fascinating.
Well,
I got in trouble,

676
00:35:38.810 --> 00:35:43.320
black lives matter or do all lives matter that that one was like,
okay,

677
00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:47.670
well that's it.
Bernie said,
well,
fucking of course all lives matter,

678
00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:52.320
but black on loaded question.
Two question answer.
They should say.

679
00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:55.050
That's a loaded question and I'm not going to answer it.
Of course.

680
00:35:55.051 --> 00:35:58.620
All lives matter.
I understand the movement and I think a,
B and c about,
yes,

681
00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:00.930
I agree with you.
That's,
that's the right way to say it,

682
00:36:00.931 --> 00:36:04.740
but he said black lives matter because that's the progressive left wing thing to

683
00:36:04.741 --> 00:36:08.280
say because you're not going to get shit from white people about it,

684
00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:11.940
but you'll get a lot of Brownie points from buying crap from Shaun king who was

685
00:36:11.941 --> 00:36:12.790
a white guy about it.

686
00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:15.780
Shaun king is a white guy that was getting out of that feminist film festival

687
00:36:15.781 --> 00:36:19.310
for saying he was white.
They have rubber Titone,
tranny menstruating,

688
00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:24.060
Jesus Christ.
I saw that.
I've got like it hasn't buff.
I find it funny,

689
00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:26.370
but they're triggered by me saying Sean King is white.

690
00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:27.900
That was one of my favorite videos of yours.

691
00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:29.940
That was a really that and the Lena Dunham video,

692
00:36:29.970 --> 00:36:33.420
but the that video particularly of you with the feminist because first of all

693
00:36:33.421 --> 00:36:36.900
you being very reasonable and they got upset right away.

694
00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:40.320
Like they were getting upset like you were.
You weren't being aggressive,

695
00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:41.700
you weren't being rude,

696
00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:45.920
you were asking like really pretty reasonable questions and you know they're

697
00:36:45.930 --> 00:36:50.200
like disclosure.
I was being a disturber like I don't deny that.

698
00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:54.030
Selectively edited anything you've ever watched his edited,
well,

699
00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:54.691
what are you going to do?

700
00:36:54.691 --> 00:36:57.480
Put All fucking three hours of whatever the fuck you were there.

701
00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:01.110
Time like James O'keefe for Andrew Breitbart of the planned parenthood videos do

702
00:37:01.111 --> 00:37:03.270
because they're journalists.
What I do is entertainment,

703
00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:04.950
but they'll actually put up the full footage.
See,

704
00:37:04.951 --> 00:37:07.440
I don't know what the fuck those planned parenthood.
I didn't.

705
00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:11.070
I watched part of it and I was like,
is this real?
Like what's going on with this?

706
00:37:11.470 --> 00:37:14.910
Are these people really talking like this about parts footage?

707
00:37:14.911 --> 00:37:15.541
You can watch three,

708
00:37:15.541 --> 00:37:18.540
four hours and the big thing he attack you and Carly Fiorina for talking about

709
00:37:18.541 --> 00:37:22.110
it.
They go,
well,
it didn't really happen in a video.
Listen,
she has 30 seconds.

710
00:37:22.290 --> 00:37:25.800
She's talking about pieces in the video that you can see and she sets it in a

711
00:37:25.801 --> 00:37:27.930
narrative that she can answer in 30 seconds and they go,

712
00:37:27.931 --> 00:37:30.900
well that all those things didn't happen in that timeline in a video.
Well,

713
00:37:30.901 --> 00:37:35.901
educate me because were they or were they not saying that we can get you in

714
00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:40.620
contact fetuses and then we were selling fetus parts.
Yeah,
so they were right.

715
00:37:40.690 --> 00:37:42.810
So they don't think anybody's saying that it's a hoax.

716
00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:45.780
Well why did they say the same thing?
You know with with a Andrew Breitbart,

717
00:37:45.781 --> 00:37:48.840
the acorn scandal.
Well let's not get into that,
but we know it's important.

718
00:37:48.841 --> 00:37:51.550
They attack the Messenger.
That's what they do.
ACORNS.

719
00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:53.490
Scandal was pretty fucking clear.
They were,

720
00:37:53.491 --> 00:37:58.491
they were literally giving people advice on how to sell it to the exact same

721
00:37:59.161 --> 00:38:02.100
detention,
the exact same thing.
They said it's dishonest.

722
00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:03.570
These are selectively edited.

723
00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:07.710
And their final argument was when James O'keefe appear,
and I'm a,

724
00:38:07.711 --> 00:38:08.491
I'm not a journalist,

725
00:38:08.491 --> 00:38:10.290
so I just make it clear like that's why I don't release full.

726
00:38:10.291 --> 00:38:12.540
It's designed to be funny.
It's more in line with the daily show.

727
00:38:12.541 --> 00:38:14.900
Then something at Fox News or CNN.
Um,

728
00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:18.630
James O'keefe went on Fox and friends in a pimp jacket,

729
00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:19.830
like promoting the videos.

730
00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:23.610
And their argument was he didn't go in dressed like a pimp and her dress that

731
00:38:23.611 --> 00:38:26.930
they said they were pimps and prostitutes,
but they didn't dress like that.

732
00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:30.720
How do you tell me I've pinned for a prostitute tresses cause I bet you're
wrong.

733
00:38:30.721 --> 00:38:33.120
And the black lives matter,
people get mad at me.
Listen man,

734
00:38:33.350 --> 00:38:35.160
dress like Ben Carson.
I was in drag,

735
00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:38.680
I was in Vegas once and I was with a couple of my buddies and we were at this

736
00:38:38.681 --> 00:38:43.000
bar and a,
it was a UFC diet.
Uh,
it was,
uh,
the,
the night of the way ends.

737
00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:46.060
So we went to the winds and we were at the bar and there was this girl who

738
00:38:46.061 --> 00:38:50.680
looked like a fucking executive at a fortune 500 company.
I mean,

739
00:38:50.681 --> 00:38:54.040
she had a respectable business dress on,
she had nice clothes on,

740
00:38:54.041 --> 00:38:58.390
a nice purse and she was talking to me and all my friends and I was like,

741
00:38:58.391 --> 00:39:02.080
something is fucking going on here.
And then I'll,

742
00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:04.210
I don't know what it was,

743
00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:07.150
but my friends were hitting on her and all this and she was just a little too

744
00:39:07.151 --> 00:39:11.740
receptive.
And I said,
so I,
I,
it was just,
my friends were ugly.
It was his,

745
00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:15.540
I say,
you have low confidence in your friends as well.
They're savages.
Okay.

746
00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:16.151
You know,
I mean,

747
00:39:16.151 --> 00:39:20.050
maybe she just wants a gorilla fucked by a bunch of a bunch of savages,

748
00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:24.970
but,
um,
but I was like,
something's going on here.
So I go,
um,

749
00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:28.390
how much is all this going to cost everybody?
And she goes,
well,

750
00:39:28.391 --> 00:39:32.830
it depends how many guys.
And they all went,
yeah.
And I go,
yeah.

751
00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:36.070
And then they went,
how'd you know?
And I go,
well,
I'm,
I'm,

752
00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:39.850
I'm guessing some insincerity.
She's working,
you're working right?
And she goes,

753
00:39:39.851 --> 00:39:44.290
yeah,
I'm working,
you know,
and I go,
okay.
And so,
and then they were like,
damn,

754
00:39:44.570 --> 00:39:47.920
yeah,
I go,
you thought she liked you?
And then everybody starts laughing.
I go,

755
00:39:47.921 --> 00:39:49.480
well,
if you look at her,

756
00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:53.440
she looks like she could be an executive for like a Mandalay bay.

757
00:39:53.650 --> 00:39:54.640
Like she could be there.

758
00:39:54.641 --> 00:39:57.190
Like is everybody enjoying their stay here at Mandalay bay?

759
00:39:57.370 --> 00:39:59.290
Anybody want their cock suck for $1,000?

760
00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:02.590
I mean it was like you run the pick up on that growing up in Montreal like I did

761
00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:06.130
really well.
I mean it's everywhere.
But how do they dress?
Well,

762
00:40:06.131 --> 00:40:07.870
I mean you just look when someone approaches,
you know,

763
00:40:07.871 --> 00:40:10.060
I can't tell how they dress.
I about my pimps or prostitutes.

764
00:40:10.210 --> 00:40:14.110
I'm saying the guy went out and a giant feathered purple coat and a fedora on

765
00:40:14.111 --> 00:40:18.170
the show.
And again,
as a gag,
right?
It's like pimps up hoes down.
Right,
right.

766
00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:22.870
And so the lab do that in the acorn video.
So this is misleading.
Okay.

767
00:40:22.871 --> 00:40:27.400
So what is,
what is the argument against the planned parenthood video?

768
00:40:27.401 --> 00:40:28.450
What are they saying?

769
00:40:28.510 --> 00:40:33.280
That they're doing something that's illegal in selling baby parts?
That's,

770
00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:38.440
but what is the argument against the video?
I'm saying when people,
so they said,

771
00:40:38.441 --> 00:40:42.310
hey,
selectively edited it and that it didn't appear in the video.

772
00:40:42.311 --> 00:40:45.970
And then when the full video footage was released,
the arguments that I saw was,

773
00:40:45.971 --> 00:40:48.880
well,
no one's going to watch 12 hours of footage.
It's kind of,

774
00:40:48.881 --> 00:40:49.714
I mean that happened to me.

775
00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:53.560
If you want to get to the truth or something that's really important.
Right.

776
00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:55.910
Do you have it?
That's the whole point.
So if you selectively edit it,

777
00:40:55.911 --> 00:40:57.940
they say you edited it.
If you put up the full footage of like,

778
00:40:57.941 --> 00:41:00.310
well you're hiding behind the fact that you know,
no one's going to watch that.

779
00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:03.540
Okay.
But if someone does watch the full 12 hours,
they'll find it.
Is it,

780
00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:05.680
does it appear like it did in the edited video?

781
00:41:05.681 --> 00:41:08.950
Cause I watched the edited video and I thought like Whoa,
this is kind of crazy.

782
00:41:08.951 --> 00:41:12.770
They're talking about it.
Like how did she describe it as like line items?
Yes.

783
00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:15.940
And I was like fuck man,
that seems like really in human.

784
00:41:15.941 --> 00:41:20.941
You're talking about feed his parts and that they can adjust their process in

785
00:41:21.251 --> 00:41:22.930
order to get more intact video.

786
00:41:22.930 --> 00:41:26.740
And then the other really fucking disturbing thing about the video was when they

787
00:41:26.741 --> 00:41:31.720
reach into the pile of baby parts and their arms and they're,

788
00:41:31.721 --> 00:41:35.780
they're literally point,
you see baby arms like,
and I'm pro choice.

789
00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:38.810
I think you should be able to do whatever the fuck you want up to a point.

790
00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:44.060
And I think it's one of those things in life that there is a gray area and I

791
00:41:44.061 --> 00:41:48.980
think I'm pro choice.
If it's a bunch of cells,
I'm pro choice if it's,
you know,

792
00:41:48.981 --> 00:41:52.730
a cluster of cells the size of a walnut.
But I think once it,

793
00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:55.160
once it becomes in fucking human being,

794
00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:58.790
like you're looking at a little tiny human beings inside someone's body.

795
00:41:59.030 --> 00:42:02.120
I don't know what the call is.
I don't know what the legislation is.

796
00:42:02.121 --> 00:42:05.840
They want to have abortions up to 22 weeks.
What does 22 weeks?

797
00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:09.050
Four eight to Jesus.
Yeah,
that's Wendy Davis.
Uh,

798
00:42:09.090 --> 00:42:11.540
and also if that's what they're pushing for and they want it to be,
you know,

799
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:13.220
and they want it to be taxpayer funded.

800
00:42:13.370 --> 00:42:15.080
That's the deal that people have a problem with.

801
00:42:15.081 --> 00:42:17.990
You know there you have some people who are pro life on principle and then you

802
00:42:17.991 --> 00:42:18.824
have some people who say,

803
00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:22.280
I still should never have to pay for an abortion and you should never be able to

804
00:42:22.281 --> 00:42:26.570
force an employer to pay for the board low 42 weeks,
20 to 22 weeks.

805
00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:30.980
Jesus Christ.
That's kind of me of path.
Three months.
That's what they want.

806
00:42:30.981 --> 00:42:33.380
Legally.
Three months is weird because it's like it can't,

807
00:42:33.410 --> 00:42:36.350
it's not viable outside of the womb,
but when you look at it,

808
00:42:36.351 --> 00:42:38.050
it looks like a fetus put said,

809
00:42:38.051 --> 00:42:41.900
see that's the thing that the left has a real issue with because they don't
want,

810
00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:47.510
there's,
there's no open discussion,
there's no objectivity.
There's no,

811
00:42:47.511 --> 00:42:51.080
when it comes to this like you are either my vagina.
Exactly.

812
00:42:51.081 --> 00:42:56.081
It's either like you are pro choice or you are some fucking barbarian who's

813
00:42:56.331 --> 00:42:59.930
prolife and you want to fuck with people's bodies and you want to stand outside

814
00:42:59.931 --> 00:43:03.230
of abortion clinics with signs and show show aborted fetuses.

815
00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:06.910
But I'm not saying that I am.
I am pro choice.
I think you should be able,

816
00:43:06.930 --> 00:43:09.350
I'm not the person to tell you what you can or can't do with your body,

817
00:43:09.351 --> 00:43:13.360
but what we're looking at is a baby.
Well it's,
yeah,
what it is,

818
00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:16.550
it comes down to the irony of the left saying the right is anti-science and you

819
00:43:16.551 --> 00:43:18.140
have well known atheist,

820
00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:20.640
even like Christopher Hitchens and Dawkins isn't prolife,

821
00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:23.660
but he kind of slipped up where they admitted that it was ending a life.

822
00:43:23.661 --> 00:43:26.420
Chris Richards is like,
I think absolutely.
Undoubtedly it's a life.

823
00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:29.990
And he walked people through it and then of course he became hated by the left

824
00:43:29.991 --> 00:43:31.070
and a bigot and a racist.

825
00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:35.300
So people who claim that the writer anti-science when it comes to abortion,

826
00:43:35.301 --> 00:43:39.830
they want abortions past a point where there is no doubt that scientifically,
um,

827
00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:41.930
that is much more than a cluster of cells.

828
00:43:43.450 --> 00:43:48.450
I got into it with this comedian online from England because I'm Dawkins had

829
00:43:48.471 --> 00:43:50.780
said something that like a,
a,

830
00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:54.680
a fetus or an embryo is known is,

831
00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:58.970
has just as much in common with a human being as a,

832
00:43:58.971 --> 00:44:02.960
a pig embryo or something like that.
Or is no different than a pig embryo.

833
00:44:02.961 --> 00:44:04.910
Actually forget how we worded it,
but I was like,

834
00:44:04.911 --> 00:44:09.260
well that's just disingenuous because obviously a human embryo is going to

835
00:44:09.261 --> 00:44:11.340
become a human if you don't snuff and out.
Right.

836
00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:15.350
Pig Embryo is a fucking pig that this goes back to the same thing and political,

837
00:44:15.351 --> 00:44:18.710
you know,
political correctness in standup or cultural Marxism,

838
00:44:18.711 --> 00:44:21.680
it's the same thing.
It's not,
hey,
you can have a reasonable position.

839
00:44:21.681 --> 00:44:25.520
You can argue being pro life and I can say,
okay,
I see where you're coming from.

840
00:44:25.521 --> 00:44:27.350
It's you had a controller,
uterus.

841
00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:30.680
But what I was going to say is that this guy started saying I was right wing.

842
00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:33.240
He was like saying,
yeah,
you're right wing and this is,

843
00:44:33.241 --> 00:44:34.980
I know I'm not and I'm pro choice.

844
00:44:34.981 --> 00:44:37.560
I'm saying like right now that is going to be a baby.

845
00:44:37.561 --> 00:44:41.100
You can't say that's the same as a fee as a pig because it's not.

846
00:44:41.570 --> 00:44:44.010
And he was like,
it's no.
That was the other argument.
He was like,

847
00:44:44.011 --> 00:44:45.480
it's no different than a seed.
I go,

848
00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:49.110
it's not a seed I go cause the seed needs to be germinated.
A seed.

849
00:44:49.111 --> 00:44:52.620
You need to put it in the ground and east he watered and then it sprouts and

850
00:44:52.621 --> 00:44:55.410
then becomes a plant.
This is something that's going,
it's already growing.

851
00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:59.640
This is a seed is the egg.
Okay?
That's the egg inside of a woman's body.

852
00:44:59.790 --> 00:45:01.860
No one's saying you can't take eggs out of your body.

853
00:45:02.010 --> 00:45:03.600
I'm not even saying you can't have abortions,

854
00:45:03.601 --> 00:45:06.230
but let's be honest about what it is.
But it's,

855
00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:09.690
it is a fetus or an embryo or whatever you want to call it.
Me,

856
00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:14.370
there's a certain amount of weeks where it becomes scientifically considered a

857
00:45:14.371 --> 00:45:19.050
fetus.
But you know,
I,
I'm not,
I'm not a right wing guy in a second,

858
00:45:19.051 --> 00:45:21.570
but I don't like the distinctions man.
I don't like,

859
00:45:21.571 --> 00:45:24.240
but the left sees you as that way.
That's the problem.
I don't think so.

860
00:45:24.241 --> 00:45:28.170
I think I'm more people see me as being a liberal hippie then see me,

861
00:45:28.171 --> 00:45:33.171
cause I smoked pot and I have tattoos and I encourage people to do drugs.

862
00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:38.310
But I found out pro pro gay rights.
I'm pro gay marriage.

863
00:45:38.311 --> 00:45:42.780
I'm pro choice.
I'm pro a lot of things that there are a lot of,
put it this way,

864
00:45:42.781 --> 00:45:46.500
there are a lot of people in the Republican party who are that way.

865
00:45:46.501 --> 00:45:47.360
Certainly the libertarian weeks,

866
00:45:47.361 --> 00:45:48.870
certainly people who would pull the lever for that.

867
00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:52.170
There is no one on the democratic platform,

868
00:45:52.171 --> 00:45:55.320
no one who would even allow you that inch that you just express.

869
00:45:55.321 --> 00:45:57.720
No one wanted to president.
They wouldn't even give you that time of day.

870
00:45:57.721 --> 00:46:00.660
It's abortion on demand for free at any point.

871
00:46:00.661 --> 00:46:04.170
That's their mantra and they can't stray from it and that's just that.
You know?

872
00:46:04.171 --> 00:46:07.980
That's always where I try and speak with people.
Ah,
right wing douchebag.
Oh Gosh.

873
00:46:07.981 --> 00:46:10.860
I just got echo and it was the word Douche bag was a trigger for the microphone.

874
00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:15.910
Echo.
I didn't hear it.
I mean I didn't see your own head.
You have
douche bag.

875
00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:21.370
It's a trigger that trigger your job itself.
You know,

876
00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:24.450
I've been called a racist my whole,
anytime you've come out of the closet,

877
00:46:24.451 --> 00:46:28.620
been banned for you all you are white
jokes.

878
00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:30.030
I ended my set.

879
00:46:30.031 --> 00:46:34.710
The reason Tony Comacho signed me was I ended my set on the n word er,

880
00:46:34.711 --> 00:46:38.340
stuck the landing goodnight.
Everyone walked off and he was going,
okay,

881
00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:43.680
I want to hear more.
Okay.
In all fairness,
Tony Camacho,
not,

882
00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:47.510
not the best judge of standup.
I know.
Well,
no,
he's,
I don't want to see you.

883
00:46:47.511 --> 00:46:50.720
You're a nice guy.
Well,
I slept on his couch and stuff for a very nice guy.
Yeah.

884
00:46:50.730 --> 00:46:55.440
But my point is,
you know,
if you pull that out now,
if you pull that out now,
it's,

885
00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:58.470
I mean,
if I didn't have my own independent thing going,
you end someone's career.

886
00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:00.780
Have you ever said the n word like Paula Deen?
The deposition was,

887
00:47:00.990 --> 00:47:04.770
have you ever said the n word?
Anyone who's anyone who's,
who's,

888
00:47:05.130 --> 00:47:07.920
who would sing along to a run DMC album would have to answer yes.

889
00:47:07.921 --> 00:47:11.770
They didn't ask the context and that's where we are.
Anything run DMC,

890
00:47:12.090 --> 00:47:16.650
they didn't,
I think you're thinking like Nwa maybe.
I mean,
it's in their name.

891
00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:19.980
That's what Kanye does.
The end that douchebag.
But he's a brilliant Mc.

892
00:47:21.870 --> 00:47:26.370
Yeah.
Okay.
He got a couple good songs.
He does.
Yeah.
All right.
Sorry,

893
00:47:26.371 --> 00:47:28.740
what were you going to say?
You want to see some of that,
Tony?
Do I know what?
No,

894
00:47:28.741 --> 00:47:32.320
no.
I'll tell you that later.
Tell you that off the Lewis.
A nice guy.
I liked Tony.

895
00:47:32.350 --> 00:47:34.720
Yeah.
Oh,
it was always been a nice guy.
He's always been a nice guy.

896
00:47:34.730 --> 00:47:38.140
My point is I was 17 and he,
you know,
brought,
would've said,
I want to hear more.

897
00:47:38.590 --> 00:47:40.930
I want to hear more.
I'm not exactly sure if that,

898
00:47:40.990 --> 00:47:43.780
that's the best way to end your sentence on.
The reason was,
the bit was,

899
00:47:43.781 --> 00:47:45.620
and I've talked about it and I'll even do it here.

900
00:47:45.650 --> 00:47:47.500
I talk about it and open about,
it was a,

901
00:47:47.501 --> 00:47:49.720
it was a bit about French Canadians watching rap videos.

902
00:47:49.721 --> 00:47:52.750
So you have these French Canadians who are trying to mimic urban accents from

903
00:47:52.751 --> 00:47:56.440
the United States and to the point where you would have them use words they'd

904
00:47:56.441 --> 00:47:58.750
seen in rap videos.
They didn't even grasp the meaning.
And so I did,

905
00:47:58.751 --> 00:48:03.520
it was a whole bilingual set of using French words and merging English and white

906
00:48:03.521 --> 00:48:04.960
kids using the n word and walking off.

907
00:48:04.961 --> 00:48:07.390
And it was kind of a shock but really funny cause everyone had heard it.

908
00:48:07.391 --> 00:48:09.550
And that's how I ended it.
That's like on the,
just for laughs too.

909
00:48:09.550 --> 00:48:10.690
Speaking of the n word,

910
00:48:10.691 --> 00:48:14.560
did you hear that Trevor Noah is a joke thieve cause it choked the flick

911
00:48:14.561 --> 00:48:17.100
straight up the South African and the guy was out new,

912
00:48:17.101 --> 00:48:21.370
the new host of the daily show did a show recently.
Um,
I forgot what it was for,

913
00:48:21.371 --> 00:48:26.371
but it wasn't a broadcast show and he did an old Dave Chappelle bit for Dave

914
00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:30.940
Chappelle bit,
I want to say from like the early two thousands,

915
00:48:31.750 --> 00:48:36.220
like one of his early specials and I mean moved it around a little bit,

916
00:48:36.221 --> 00:48:39.280
but it's the same fucking joke.
I mean verbatim.

917
00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:41.590
Thank God you didn't get on stage at the comedy store,

918
00:48:43.060 --> 00:48:46.410
get on stage with him at the comedy store.
Oh,
Trevor Noah,
why not?

919
00:48:47.050 --> 00:48:50.140
Because they meant see,
oh the men's see you thing.
Well that's actually funny.

920
00:48:50.141 --> 00:48:51.820
I will watch that.
And you know who I called,

921
00:48:51.821 --> 00:48:52.631
I don't know if you're still with her,

922
00:48:52.631 --> 00:48:55.810
was with Tony Camacho and I had a meeting with Stacy mark.
Yeah,

923
00:48:55.910 --> 00:48:58.080
cause you mentioned her and I was like,
oh,
that must be my person.

924
00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:01.380
She's still my age.
And she became my agent five minutes after that.
After that.

925
00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:05.440
Then yeah,
because my agent at the time was the same age and has been seeing,

926
00:49:05.441 --> 00:49:08.670
they wanted me to apologize to him.
Yeah,
I remember we're done.

927
00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:10.930
How to list of going down.
This is what's weird.

928
00:49:10.931 --> 00:49:14.040
I was nervous coming in here because no,
when I was at Fox News,
um,

929
00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:16.300
I was there for four and a half years and I went on air,
you know,

930
00:49:16.301 --> 00:49:19.990
for the first time I had never seen any of these people.
I don't,

931
00:49:20.050 --> 00:49:22.390
I'd never had cable,
we didn't get Fox News in Montreal.

932
00:49:22.391 --> 00:49:24.020
So I kind of went in and wasn't starstruck.

933
00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:26.220
I've been watching you since I was like 10.
I mean,

934
00:49:26.221 --> 00:49:28.600
they've fully as a national hero is a national treasure.

935
00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:33.010
Newsradio UFC have been following for a long time.
So it's,
you know,

936
00:49:33.011 --> 00:49:35.530
you have to make sure that you're still yourself in the face of someone who,

937
00:49:35.531 --> 00:49:35.920
you know,

938
00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:38.740
the one time I got really stressed up with Clint Eastwood and there's a certain

939
00:49:38.741 --> 00:49:41.650
level of fame with which I'm no longer comfortable and I just made an ass of

940
00:49:41.651 --> 00:49:46.600
myself.
Yeah.
That's a level like we,
yeah.
If I ever met Clint Eastwood,

941
00:49:46.601 --> 00:49:50.350
I'd probably be a babbling fucking idiot too.
I was outlaw Josey Wales do it.

942
00:49:50.351 --> 00:49:52.090
It's tough to get past that.
How do you say to him,
like,

943
00:49:52.091 --> 00:49:54.400
I love doing every which way,
but loose.
What do you pick?
That's a good one.

944
00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:55.270
It was a good one.

945
00:49:55.270 --> 00:49:57.910
I don't know how they train them to say you're the shit dog and give him some

946
00:49:57.911 --> 00:49:59.680
knuckles.
Well he said to me,

947
00:49:59.830 --> 00:50:02.730
he turns around and now he kind of saw it was looking at him and I don't you

948
00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:04.240
never want to be that kind of bothering you.

949
00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:09.340
A I'm Clint and put out his hand like,
yeah,
he doesn't have to say that,

950
00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:14.050
but he does.
Yeah.
He kind of,
I guess a lot of those really,

951
00:50:14.051 --> 00:50:15.070
really famous guys,

952
00:50:15.310 --> 00:50:18.850
they kind of have to do that because they don't want to assume that you know who

953
00:50:18.851 --> 00:50:20.980
they are,
even though they do know that you know who they are.

954
00:50:21.250 --> 00:50:24.470
So it's kind of like a common courtesy thing to ask your name instead of say,

955
00:50:24.471 --> 00:50:27.910
what's your name?
Nice to meet you buddy.
Like you know who I am,
bitch.
Right.

956
00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:30.440
You know what you do,
Steve,
Steve Crowder,
or nice to meet you.

957
00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:33.620
You want to hear funny clean switch story.
Yes.
Okay.
So this is true.

958
00:50:33.621 --> 00:50:37.130
They have to do with the Obama sit down thing.
Well,

959
00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:40.640
look at this kind of thing with uh,
conservatives in the entertainment industry.

960
00:50:40.641 --> 00:50:42.910
So it's very small and closed circuit and everyone,

961
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.190
it's small enough that people introduce themselves.
Like,
Hey,
you know,

962
00:50:45.191 --> 00:50:49.400
I'm just doing kind of a comedian,
you know,
writer the La Fox News.
Uh,
Hey,
I'm so,

963
00:50:49.401 --> 00:50:52.180
and Sel director and Clint Eastwood,
everyone knows he's there,

964
00:50:52.190 --> 00:50:56.480
stands up and he goes,
hi,
I'm Clint former mayor of Carmel.

965
00:50:59.700 --> 00:51:04.520
It's true.
It's not,
it's not untrue.
And if you want to be a mayor of a place,

966
00:51:04.521 --> 00:51:08.600
that's a spot that's a fucking beautiful place.
God,
you ever been to Carmel?

967
00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:12.140
The closest event is like to Santa Barbara and I've been through it on the way

968
00:51:12.141 --> 00:51:16.370
up.
You know,
you got to keep going.
Carmel is on the way up to,
uh,
it's,

969
00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:20.660
it's right next to big Sur.
It's like maybe half hour from big Sur.
Fuck,

970
00:51:20.661 --> 00:51:21.620
it's beautiful up there.

971
00:51:21.650 --> 00:51:24.650
That might be one of the most beautiful spots in this country.

972
00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:27.440
Have you ever been in northern Michigan?
Yeah,
I've been in northern Michigan,

973
00:51:27.441 --> 00:51:30.590
north of traverse city.
Um,
I've been old Yvette.

974
00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:32.990
You know where all of that is now.
You've got to,
I mean,

975
00:51:32.991 --> 00:51:36.170
it's been actually rated most beautiful area in the country for a few years.

976
00:51:36.171 --> 00:51:40.100
Really?
Yeah.
Leland.
All County.
So it's like a,
it looks like the Mediterranean,

977
00:51:40.101 --> 00:51:43.560
you know,
vineyards rolling down to water.
That's crystal clear.
No sharks,

978
00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:48.560
a little bit of land price.
Um,
and it's just gorgeous up there.
Yeah,
there's some,

979
00:51:48.561 --> 00:51:50.840
well,
there's some beautiful spots in this country obviously,

980
00:51:50.841 --> 00:51:54.920
but when I was saying is that Carmel is,
it's a really unusual area.

981
00:51:54.950 --> 00:51:56.540
There's not a lot of people there.
It's like,

982
00:51:57.020 --> 00:52:01.190
it's like the land it like there's the water and then it doesn't go in that
deep,

983
00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:05.660
you know,
the deep into the,
into the mainland.
It's his fucking stunning,

984
00:52:05.661 --> 00:52:08.960
stunning countryside and beautiful views of the ocean.
Well,

985
00:52:09.010 --> 00:52:12.080
that's where they did play misty for me.
Oh yeah,
that's right.

986
00:52:12.081 --> 00:52:13.730
He's with beats the hell out of that broad.

987
00:52:13.790 --> 00:52:15.770
He's probably been going up there for a long time.

988
00:52:16.130 --> 00:52:19.190
That's what he just beats the hell out of her.
You can't do that anymore.

989
00:52:20.190 --> 00:52:22.400
And we're watching it for the first time like,
oh,
this is pretty good.

990
00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:25.250
And he just comes in the hell you want.
Just starts wailing on it.
I'm like,

991
00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:28.430
oh my God.
You're like dirty Harry films.

992
00:52:28.431 --> 00:52:31.220
He's just punching some prostitute with an Afro and you're like,

993
00:52:31.250 --> 00:52:33.860
you can't like blowing them away with his 44 magnum.

994
00:52:33.890 --> 00:52:36.680
You can't do any of that stuff anymore.
You couldn't make blazing saddles.

995
00:52:36.681 --> 00:52:38.660
Super hard to punch women on movies.

996
00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:41.330
Like that woman would have to be like a demon or something like that.

997
00:52:41.380 --> 00:52:43.370
And even then,
even then,
I don't know,
I don't want to sit,

998
00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:47.060
I'd say it's a representation of the patriarchal society.
That's right.

999
00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:51.740
Like Mad Max.
Did you see that?
Everyone the remittance.
It wasn't bad.

1000
00:52:51.741 --> 00:52:54.830
It was bizarre,
but it was like a,
all these were saying it's,

1001
00:52:54.831 --> 00:52:58.490
it's pro feminist message cause it's Charlise thrown kicks ass.
And

1002
00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:01.400
then the feminist had actually,

1003
00:53:01.401 --> 00:53:05.030
it's not because the real leader is a guy and it's patriarchy and all these

1004
00:53:05.031 --> 00:53:09.480
Tumblr blog and it was like nothing can be gay guy.
Who,

1005
00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:13.390
what's his face?
Tom?
A what?
The fucks.
I'm hardy.
Tom Hardy?
No,
not Tom Hardy.

1006
00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:15.350
There's like an old gray haired guy who was like a leader.

1007
00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:18.830
I don't think Tom Hardy's guy.
He should.
Sean's reporter who asked him,
he said,

1008
00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:21.560
oh you're asking me about sexuality and it was like,
just go away.

1009
00:53:22.090 --> 00:53:25.200
It's not interesting.
Yeah,
that's what you're saying when you're gay.
Yeah.
I know.

1010
00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:28.680
My rule is if a woman claim she's bisexual,
like a teenager,

1011
00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:33.100
she's trying to be cool.
If the guy says that he's gay.
Oh really?
Yeah.
Right.

1012
00:53:33.170 --> 00:53:37.500
I've never met a bike guy who wasn't gay.
Yeah,
me neither.

1013
00:53:38.070 --> 00:53:41.010
Yeah.
I always say there's two types of dudes.

1014
00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:44.340
There's gay dudes and then there's really gullible,

1015
00:53:44.341 --> 00:53:48.840
straight dudes who get talked into blowing crafty gay dudes like Bowie McJagger.

1016
00:53:49.110 --> 00:53:52.040
We don't really want to do that.
David Bowie and,
Oh,

1017
00:53:52.290 --> 00:53:57.130
Jack All we met one person who's bullied Mick Jagger.
Yeah.
Fuck that.

1018
00:53:57.180 --> 00:54:02.060
Stand up and one of the top votes and Garfunkel emerging names.
That's fine.

1019
00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:03.260
Although that night they got it on,

1020
00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:06.860
they too became once I might've made that up about Tom Hardy.
No,

1021
00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:09.910
I think he talked about experimenting at one point,
but now all these guy,

1022
00:54:11.270 --> 00:54:12.090
are you a scientist?

1023
00:54:12.090 --> 00:54:15.300
We suck in the deck with a lab coat on a beaker in your hand.
What are you doing?

1024
00:54:15.900 --> 00:54:19.070
That's not for some reason I'm picturing beaker from the muppets game,

1025
00:54:21.820 --> 00:54:26.820
but back in the 70s and the 60s I think more people did experiment that might

1026
00:54:27.241 --> 00:54:29.280
not even be gay because there were,

1027
00:54:29.340 --> 00:54:33.090
they were breaking down so many bizarre boundaries and there was so much

1028
00:54:33.091 --> 00:54:38.070
restriction on behavior from the McCarthy era in the 1950s and the way people

1029
00:54:38.071 --> 00:54:42.120
behaved,
it was all of a sudden everyone's doing acid and they're free love.

1030
00:54:42.121 --> 00:54:44.520
And I think there was a lot of Dick suck in there that people want.

1031
00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:45.870
I shouldn't have done that.

1032
00:54:46.370 --> 00:54:50.760
Like they legitimately weren't gay but did some gay shit.
That's,
I'm a little,

1033
00:54:50.761 --> 00:54:53.430
I know I'm not a historian.
We were getting off the realm of,

1034
00:54:53.431 --> 00:54:56.340
of something that we can prove.
It works like Lavar Burton,

1035
00:54:56.341 --> 00:54:59.730
you don't have to take my word for it as you were Barb Burton gang.
No,

1036
00:54:59.731 --> 00:55:01.200
but I mean you were watching it and reading rainbow.

1037
00:55:01.230 --> 00:55:04.530
Do you think when he puts those things on is just glued inside there?

1038
00:55:05.340 --> 00:55:08.910
Maybe that's why.
Where's that kaleidoscope and Marvin,
hey,
we're looking at,

1039
00:55:10.450 --> 00:55:13.980
but
the big kaleidoscope,

1040
00:55:14.690 --> 00:55:17.100
remember reading rainbow and you'd always be like,
you know this book,

1041
00:55:17.101 --> 00:55:20.130
you talk about it and a little Polo and his is Burger King,
kids' club haircut.

1042
00:55:20.131 --> 00:55:23.040
And he's like,
but you don't have to take my word for it.
And it's like,
okay,

1043
00:55:23.041 --> 00:55:24.330
so we're not taking your word for it.

1044
00:55:24.331 --> 00:55:28.470
We should take the word of a bunch of six year olds,
this book.

1045
00:55:28.470 --> 00:55:32.580
Because I was like,
how have a little respect you have for your own opinion?

1046
00:55:32.581 --> 00:55:36.310
Lavar well I think just being humble,
right?
Maybe you know,

1047
00:55:36.660 --> 00:55:40.140
which is generally not a quality found in the gay community.
No,
I don't know.

1048
00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:41.760
They're dramatic.
They have a flair for the dramatic,

1049
00:55:41.761 --> 00:55:43.380
they do have a flair for the dramatic.

1050
00:55:43.410 --> 00:55:45.810
That's one of the cool qualities about them.
Oh,

1051
00:55:45.811 --> 00:55:49.980
it's hilarious guy in like a disaster.
Like a fire drill.
It's funny,

1052
00:55:50.550 --> 00:55:53.190
I've never seen a gay guy in a disaster.
I have a guy,

1053
00:55:53.191 --> 00:55:55.170
actually I was talking to my brother about it,

1054
00:55:55.210 --> 00:55:58.740
famous actor my brother works with and um,
he has like,
you know the earth,

1055
00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:01.280
an earthquake kit and it's,
do you have that in your trunk anymore?

1056
00:56:01.290 --> 00:56:02.280
Like an emergency kit?

1057
00:56:02.620 --> 00:56:04.950
Because he had that when he was here for the big earthquakes and he was in some

1058
00:56:04.980 --> 00:56:08.280
area where it was like really gay and he just said it was so funny.

1059
00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:13.230
They were just running around in the streets
and he's like super liberal,

1060
00:56:13.231 --> 00:56:15.840
you know,
further to left and either of us and tolerant.
He was just like,

1061
00:56:15.841 --> 00:56:19.300
it was just really a trip to see.
Well Milo,

1062
00:56:19.350 --> 00:56:23.770
you think he's going to be your rock when that goes down?
No,
no,
no,
no.

1063
00:56:23.860 --> 00:56:26.470
He'll fall apart.
I don't know if he'll fall apart,

1064
00:56:26.471 --> 00:56:29.720
but he's running into the arms of another.
There's,
yeah,

1065
00:56:29.730 --> 00:56:33.460
I'm just going to be some issues there for sure.
But you know,
that's just not,

1066
00:56:33.461 --> 00:56:37.930
his wheelhouse isn't his wheelhouse.
Isn't fucking toughening up,
you know,

1067
00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:42.690
I don't know.
And fucking riding it out,
riding the storm out.
That's the negative.

1068
00:56:43.630 --> 00:56:45.730
I'm a little offended.
It is a negative stereotype,

1069
00:56:45.731 --> 00:56:48.430
but the femininity of the gay male,

1070
00:56:48.940 --> 00:56:52.570
it's very funny and it's okay to like I talked well that was at the same at

1071
00:56:52.580 --> 00:56:54.760
Seapak.
It was like this political action committee.

1072
00:56:54.761 --> 00:56:57.120
That's where Huffington Post's said,
I yelled the n word and I didn't.

1073
00:56:57.121 --> 00:57:00.470
And they said,
I joke about raping Ashley Judd and I didn't wait.
What was that?

1074
00:57:00.670 --> 00:57:03.190
Why did they say that was the fact check?
Stand up.

1075
00:57:03.191 --> 00:57:06.040
This is a Huffington post and that's why when we were talking you were doing

1076
00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:09.460
standup.
Yeah.
That was emceeing a political action conference.
Right.

1077
00:57:09.710 --> 00:57:13.420
I was just doing some bits and uh,
one of them wasn't a private room.

1078
00:57:13.421 --> 00:57:17.620
It was like a blogging awards ceremony and we had a rap video,
Mister America,

1079
00:57:17.621 --> 00:57:20.320
we were dressed up as Thomas Jefferson and George Washington.

1080
00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:22.890
And one of the jokes in the video,
you know,

1081
00:57:22.900 --> 00:57:25.900
it's not something you put on your resume,
but it was a bringing back knickers.

1082
00:57:25.901 --> 00:57:28.440
It's a rap song or record stops.
And I'm like,
no,
no,
I can,

1083
00:57:28.441 --> 00:57:31.190
I can say knickers because I wear knickers and we actually have black producers.

1084
00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:33.730
Like,
oh,
okay.
You know,
gives us a thumbs up,
like put paths for knickers.

1085
00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:35.950
So I'm fine if I've been in post when I say,
okay,

1086
00:57:35.951 --> 00:57:38.650
they made a joke that's risque and you know,
but they just said,

1087
00:57:38.651 --> 00:57:43.651
Steven Crowder yells and word to Jesus Christ or Ashley makes rape joke about

1088
00:57:44.921 --> 00:57:48.640
Ashley Judd and um,
I'm sorry to interrupt.
Go ahead.
No,
no,
go ahead.

1089
00:57:48.641 --> 00:57:50.740
But that's what,
when you sent me them as a source,
I'm going,
you're sending it,

1090
00:57:50.890 --> 00:57:52.990
you know,
today's so long is tomorrow's Huffpo.

1091
00:57:52.991 --> 00:57:55.320
They are not the friend of standup comics.
No.

1092
00:57:55.330 --> 00:57:58.300
They want to destroy the voice of anyone who doesn't agree with them.

1093
00:57:58.301 --> 00:58:01.810
And that's a lot of standup comedians now.
And that's what's problematic.
Well,

1094
00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:04.960
what I've said about these people,
and I'll continue to say it,

1095
00:58:04.961 --> 00:58:07.270
I don't believe they're actually progressive's.

1096
00:58:07.570 --> 00:58:11.140
What I think they're doing is they're mining the world of ideas and they're

1097
00:58:11.141 --> 00:58:12.970
looking for things that they can attack.

1098
00:58:13.030 --> 00:58:15.820
I don't think they really want to attack it because it makes sense.

1099
00:58:16.030 --> 00:58:16.960
I think they're,
they're,

1100
00:58:16.961 --> 00:58:21.190
they're mining the world of ideas for the moral high ground and they're looking

1101
00:58:21.191 --> 00:58:25.540
to find things that they can be aggressive about and go after.

1102
00:58:25.750 --> 00:58:29.710
And it gives them a license to be really shitty to people.
Like they treat you,

1103
00:58:29.711 --> 00:58:32.810
treat someone,
you know,
you paint them as subhuman,
you can treat them subhuman.

1104
00:58:33.340 --> 00:58:36.940
Also,
it's really important if you really want to be a progressive person,

1105
00:58:36.941 --> 00:58:38.830
you really want love and acceptance in the world.

1106
00:58:38.860 --> 00:58:40.990
It's really important to not be a fucking asshole.

1107
00:58:41.110 --> 00:58:45.850
And there's a lot of these people like here's something I'm,
I'm a hunter.
Okay.

1108
00:58:45.880 --> 00:58:47.710
And so when I,
when I hunt,

1109
00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:50.710
I sometimes put pictures of these fucking animals online.

1110
00:58:50.740 --> 00:58:53.920
And one of the reasons why you do it,
I do it for a bunch of reasons.
One,

1111
00:58:53.921 --> 00:58:57.070
to see the reaction to the last one I did,

1112
00:58:57.071 --> 00:58:59.760
I did as a tribute to my friend Cameron Hanes.
Cause I,

1113
00:58:59.761 --> 00:59:02.000
I shot an elk with a bow and Arrow and he taught me how to do it.

1114
00:59:02.001 --> 00:59:05.320
It's hard to do the fucking nasty.
His people,

1115
00:59:05.321 --> 00:59:09.400
the meanest shit was vegans.
Sure.
Dog they were saying.

1116
00:59:09.401 --> 00:59:12.890
So I didn't read that.
But they're vegans.
Unsure dog.
Oh,

1117
00:59:12.940 --> 00:59:14.480
why do you reach your dog?
I actually,

1118
00:59:14.660 --> 00:59:16.330
that's how you want to know how far back it goes.

1119
00:59:16.331 --> 00:59:18.640
I had an account before the message boards,

1120
00:59:18.641 --> 00:59:21.740
I think even existed because I was watching the highlight videos because we

1121
00:59:21.741 --> 00:59:24.200
couldn't afford the pay per view.
So when I hear beautiful day from you too,

1122
00:59:24.201 --> 00:59:28.760
I still think of Sakuraba light kicking Henzel Gracie and it's beautiful
trigger.

1123
00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:31.460
But yeah,
you were all over.
Sure.
Doug,
they hate you.
That's fine.

1124
00:59:31.700 --> 00:59:35.810
But their animals.
Well,
meanwhile,
how many of those fucking dummies eat meat?

1125
00:59:35.840 --> 00:59:39.470
How many of those dummies have cats?
That's my favorite one.
People who have cats.

1126
00:59:39.471 --> 00:59:42.640
You buy cat food for your cat.
Guess what?
You're a fucking killer,
right?

1127
00:59:42.660 --> 00:59:45.110
Because they're not getting that shit from a cat food tree.
Okay.

1128
00:59:45.230 --> 00:59:48.680
They're grinding up animals that live a horrible life to live in cages and

1129
00:59:48.681 --> 00:59:50.030
they're sucking them out of those cages,

1130
00:59:50.210 --> 00:59:54.770
killing them in a ruthless cost effective manner and stuffing them into a can.

1131
00:59:54.771 --> 00:59:57.910
So you're a little fucking tabby Conine cause you still have to have a cat.
Yeah,

1132
00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:01.500
I like cats.
I know I haven't done,
I have two cats.
I have dogs too.

1133
01:00:01.501 --> 01:00:05.360
I'm a giant dog.
But,
but my point is that some of the meanest,

1134
01:00:05.420 --> 01:00:08.810
nastiest shit was being said by Vegans,

1135
01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:12.290
and I think that they have this green light to be a cunt.

1136
01:00:12.530 --> 01:00:14.390
And I think there's a lot of people that,

1137
01:00:14.570 --> 01:00:18.470
that what they do is they find areas where they have,

1138
01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:22.220
they feel like they have the green light,
you know,
they have,
there's a subject,

1139
01:00:22.221 --> 01:00:22.571
there's a,

1140
01:00:22.571 --> 01:00:26.300
an an issue that's come up and they feel like all these fucking people that went

1141
01:00:26.301 --> 01:00:27.440
after that Lion Guy,

1142
01:00:27.710 --> 01:00:31.190
like I'm not saying you should go to Africa and he killed a lion,

1143
01:00:31.370 --> 01:00:34.070
but I don't want to go to African killed.
I don't want to kill anything.

1144
01:00:34.071 --> 01:00:37.550
I'm not going to eat.
But that fucking guy did everything by the book,
by the way.

1145
01:00:37.730 --> 01:00:40.220
They all show the line with a name was his mistake.
Well,

1146
01:00:40.430 --> 01:00:41.990
here's my favorite part of it,

1147
01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:45.650
not just the protest and everybody's standing outside of his fucking clinic and

1148
01:00:45.651 --> 01:00:46.940
ruining his business.
Right.

1149
01:00:47.090 --> 01:00:51.500
My favorite part was they were worried about his brother,

1150
01:00:51.650 --> 01:00:55.700
the brother,
the lions,
Cecil's brother was,
what the fuck was his name?

1151
01:00:56.150 --> 01:00:57.290
I forget the brother's name,

1152
01:00:57.770 --> 01:01:02.540
but Cecil had a brother and the brother was also killed and everybody was

1153
01:01:02.541 --> 01:01:03.980
freaking out.
Oh my God.

1154
01:01:03.981 --> 01:01:07.490
And then they found that it wasn't the brother that was just another line and

1155
01:01:07.491 --> 01:01:10.820
everyone was relieved.
Hard to tell them.
It's hard to know.
Name fucking lion.

1156
01:01:10.970 --> 01:01:13.460
So if the line doesn't have a name,
that line ain't shit.

1157
01:01:13.490 --> 01:01:15.130
He's riding [inaudible] coattails.

1158
01:01:15.590 --> 01:01:17.330
You read the letter from the guy from Zimbabwe.

1159
01:01:17.950 --> 01:01:20.370
You see the numbers of how many people get killed by lions,

1160
01:01:20.670 --> 01:01:24.770
like 256 years or the ghost in the darkness.
Yes,
I did.
That's a nightmare.

1161
01:01:24.771 --> 01:01:27.890
Great movie since about Kimra when he was young.
It's sleek and sexy.

1162
01:01:28.010 --> 01:01:30.810
I know Michael Douglas was in that movie too.

1163
01:01:30.890 --> 01:01:33.650
I think Al Roker is val Kilmer and a fat suit.

1164
01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:37.250
We haven't seen Val Kilmer slimmed down considerably from that meme.

1165
01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:41.370
Have you seen it?
You've seen the bank?
I used to be Batman.
He's got this Dallas,

1166
01:01:41.390 --> 01:01:45.790
Joel Schumacher.
Joel [inaudible].
Both batch.
Yeah.
He was a director.

1167
01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:49.850
Remember when Val Kilmer was there was a good Batman though.

1168
01:01:49.900 --> 01:01:51.680
I thought he was good.
That's one of those songs.

1169
01:01:51.681 --> 01:01:54.620
I went back and watched and I was like Batman and Robin was bad.

1170
01:01:54.621 --> 01:01:56.810
That was really bad.
But Batman forever was that still.

1171
01:01:56.811 --> 01:01:59.270
And I went back and watched it and it,
I'm like,
I wish I would've just,

1172
01:01:59.271 --> 01:02:04.130
who was Robin?
Uh,
Chris O'donnell.
Oh,
that's whatever happened to that guy.

1173
01:02:04.330 --> 01:02:07.790
Uh,
he,
I think he has some show.
Alicia.
Alicia Silverstone was Batgirl too.

1174
01:02:07.850 --> 01:02:11.210
And then she's like a Vegan Peta person know.
Oh,
wasn't it?

1175
01:02:11.211 --> 01:02:14.990
He Crystal Donna with ll cool j and some crime show.

1176
01:02:15.290 --> 01:02:19.770
Oh Christ.
Even talking about that just dropped Iq.

1177
01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:25.170
Oh,
whew.
I was in a film Renny Harlin directed and he liked it.

1178
01:02:25.171 --> 01:02:28.170
All those things he's made of milk.
Yeah.
There he goes.
Hey guys.

1179
01:02:28.171 --> 01:02:30.860
Remember when I was that man,
I don't,

1180
01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:35.370
you know what's weird is I don't know how you let it get that far by Marlon

1181
01:02:35.370 --> 01:02:37.950
Brando.
You ever see on the waterfront and then see the last days,

1182
01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:41.990
the last days of Marlin Brando,
he's very off rated as an actor.

1183
01:02:42.420 --> 01:02:45.540
I wasn't holding your fan of James Dean and Marlon Brando was a different time.

1184
01:02:45.541 --> 01:02:47.340
But if you go to on the waterfront,

1185
01:02:47.341 --> 01:02:50.580
compare it to anything anybody else was doing.
No,
I disagree.
If you look at me.

1186
01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:54.850
Yeah,
the perfect scene is James Dean in rebel without a cause.
Um,

1187
01:02:55.350 --> 01:02:57.420
and it's so bizarre because he was very,

1188
01:02:57.421 --> 01:03:00.170
he was kind of like one of the first naturalists,
you know,
just wondered.

1189
01:03:00.190 --> 01:03:03.960
It was very,
if you look the way he spoke,
it was pretty natural,

1190
01:03:04.650 --> 01:03:08.280
but everyone else in the scene was still,
you know,
so he's like,
Oh mom,

1191
01:03:08.281 --> 01:03:11.640
you're tearing me apart.
Leave me alone.
Well,
that's a fine way to behave.

1192
01:03:11.641 --> 01:03:13.490
Young man.
I got that from his mother.
See?

1193
01:03:13.530 --> 01:03:16.050
And then you're going to James and he's sitting there talking and he's like,

1194
01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:20.640
and you're like,
this is real.
So you can just see when that transition happened.

1195
01:03:21.150 --> 01:03:25.470
And,
uh,
I think James Dean when he was alive,
didn't get the respect Brando did.

1196
01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:29.640
Hm.
I Dunno,
I didn't really pay attention to who got respect.
All right.

1197
01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:31.800
But I thought Brandon was pretty good.
And on the waterfront,

1198
01:03:31.830 --> 01:03:35.390
especially in comparison to the rest of the era.
You want to talk gay?
Um,

1199
01:03:35.550 --> 01:03:39.160
James Deane?
No,
no.
Well yeah,
but I mean the outfit,
uh,

1200
01:03:39.161 --> 01:03:40.620
the wild one with Marlon Brando,

1201
01:03:40.621 --> 01:03:43.920
the little leather and mailman hat and the handkerchief,
well you know,

1202
01:03:43.921 --> 01:03:47.840
when that became gay,
there'll became Jang.
Judas priest came around.
Right?

1203
01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:51.720
That's when it became gay.
Cause Rob Halford's gay as fuck.

1204
01:03:51.721 --> 01:03:53.340
Well they started everybody dressing guy.

1205
01:03:53.420 --> 01:03:54.810
They didn't even know they were dressing gay.

1206
01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:56.520
They just want her to be like Judas priest.

1207
01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:01.500
Do you think Marlon Brando would have dressed that way if he knew that was

1208
01:04:01.501 --> 01:04:05.220
coming down the pike?
I don't know.
Yeah.

1209
01:04:05.310 --> 01:04:08.370
I mean that's gotta be tough cause you're a sex symbol on your Marlin Brando and

1210
01:04:08.371 --> 01:04:11.760
then like this is going to become the iconic,
you know,
Mister slave outfit.
Yeah.

1211
01:04:11.790 --> 01:04:15.030
But Marlon Brando clearly didn't give a fuck about anything.

1212
01:04:15.031 --> 01:04:16.530
He didn't give a fuck about the way he looked.

1213
01:04:16.531 --> 01:04:18.780
He didn't give a fuck about his health.
I mean,

1214
01:04:18.781 --> 01:04:21.510
he was crazy towards the end of his life.
I mean,

1215
01:04:21.511 --> 01:04:25.530
he was completely out of his mind.
Yeah.
I don't think it really mattered to him.

1216
01:04:26.370 --> 01:04:27.300
He wasn't the same rider.

1217
01:04:27.301 --> 01:04:31.020
I don't think that James Dean was on a motorcycle really from to understand

1218
01:04:31.021 --> 01:04:34.550
James Deane was pretty good.
Well,
I actually got to sit in,
you know,

1219
01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:39.360
there were only like something like 14 cars that James Deane,
spider,
Ferrari,

1220
01:04:39.361 --> 01:04:41.820
whatever.
It doesn't,
I don't know a lot about cars.
What it is,
Porsche?

1221
01:04:42.210 --> 01:04:45.840
Was it a Porsche?
The one that killed him?
Okay.
Really,
really low.
We'll actually,

1222
01:04:45.841 --> 01:04:49.050
what's funny is I bought my car,
it was a 2003 tourists,

1223
01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:52.560
but it was in the back of this car shop in Dallas where this guy has done like

1224
01:04:52.561 --> 01:04:53.550
George Bushes car.

1225
01:04:53.551 --> 01:04:57.510
He just decks him out and he was just this old guy who was selling his old car

1226
01:04:57.900 --> 01:05:00.110
and a,
they showed me that it was like some absurd I want,

1227
01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:02.100
I could be wrong with a million,
$2 million.

1228
01:05:02.101 --> 01:05:05.400
They said James Dean's was lot 13 or 14,

1229
01:05:05.401 --> 01:05:09.030
and this was like 11 or 12 and it was one of those exact cars.

1230
01:05:09.540 --> 01:05:11.280
And I just looked at it,
I'm like,
it's like a go cart.

1231
01:05:11.460 --> 01:05:14.100
You're so low to the ground that's gotta be tough to control.

1232
01:05:14.130 --> 01:05:17.770
And I mean it's actually easier to control because it's low to ground and it's

1233
01:05:17.771 --> 01:05:21.640
very lightweight.
Those are pretty easy to control for the time.

1234
01:05:21.850 --> 01:05:25.810
But if you compare that to like a Boxster today,
like a Porsche Boxster,

1235
01:05:26.070 --> 01:05:28.310
it's a boxer's way more competent car.
They just,

1236
01:05:28.510 --> 01:05:31.720
but those cars were a hundred percent mechanical.
And when you're,

1237
01:05:31.721 --> 01:05:35.050
when you're buying a car today like that,
like a boxer,
which is small,

1238
01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:39.430
you're dealing with all sorts of traction,
controls,
stability management,

1239
01:05:39.431 --> 01:05:43.440
there's all sorts of behind the scenes,
computer aided shit going on.
Uh,

1240
01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:48.100
a antilock braking systems is all sorts of stuff that's happening behind the

1241
01:05:48.101 --> 01:05:49.750
scenes.
I don't,
I just know when I saw it,

1242
01:05:49.751 --> 01:05:53.050
it was one of those things where that's a perfect example.
Kind of.

1243
01:05:53.051 --> 01:05:55.690
It was my dad explained some things to me this way as a kid,
right?

1244
01:05:55.691 --> 01:05:57.920
I saw that car,
I don't know a lot about cars at all.

1245
01:05:57.921 --> 01:06:01.300
I mean it was buying a tourists and I was like,
oh,
okay,
that's pretty cool.

1246
01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:05.260
He told me,
so he told me the exact same truth that he could have told you,

1247
01:06:05.710 --> 01:06:07.660
but if you'd have seen that car,
you probably,
oh my God,

1248
01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:10.900
want to look in and be really interested in it.
We both saw the same car.

1249
01:06:10.901 --> 01:06:15.370
We both experienced the same thing,
but it's an entirely different experience.

1250
01:06:15.470 --> 01:06:18.160
Right.
And that's just kinda the way the human condition,

1251
01:06:18.700 --> 01:06:21.370
which I just find sort of fast like to me,
I was like,
oh,
okay,
that's pretty cool.

1252
01:06:21.371 --> 01:06:22.470
Let me go back.
You don't know.

1253
01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:25.000
I mean if you showed me like an old golf club or something like that,

1254
01:06:25.001 --> 01:06:28.060
I wouldn't do shit about it.
But if you show me like an old pool cue,

1255
01:06:28.061 --> 01:06:32.520
like a ballot Boucher from like 1965 I'd be like,
ah.
Right.
You know,

1256
01:06:32.540 --> 01:06:36.600
just I know pool cues,
people stand,
you don't get Jujitsu.

1257
01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:38.370
Talk to him about it.
And he was like,
all right,

1258
01:06:38.490 --> 01:06:40.040
you were a little cotton belt and you're like,
no,
you know,

1259
01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:43.570
that's one of my main things that I have to do when fights go to the ground is

1260
01:06:43.571 --> 01:06:44.590
explained all the,

1261
01:06:44.650 --> 01:06:48.610
like if I was doing commentary and it was only black belts listening,

1262
01:06:48.630 --> 01:06:52.450
I w my commentary would be infinitely shorter.
Right.
Cause uh,
you know,

1263
01:06:52.451 --> 01:06:56.200
everybody would know kind of what's going on,
you know,
you know triangle setups.

1264
01:06:56.260 --> 01:06:59.950
I mean,
you'd be going like,
like when we do these fight companion podcasts,

1265
01:07:00.310 --> 01:07:03.400
we do them like sometimes doing with Eddie Bravo and when we're watching

1266
01:07:03.401 --> 01:07:06.250
situations we're talking about like some guy going for is,
oh shit,

1267
01:07:06.370 --> 01:07:08.560
he's go for the arm bar.
Oh yeah.
Like we know,

1268
01:07:08.561 --> 01:07:10.300
I don't have to say what he's got to do now.

1269
01:07:10.390 --> 01:07:11.860
He's got to be careful of the left arm.

1270
01:07:11.861 --> 01:07:13.390
If he gets left arm past a certain position,

1271
01:07:13.391 --> 01:07:16.120
then it's now he's not in danger because it's past the elbow.
Right.

1272
01:07:16.150 --> 01:07:20.200
So there's a whole,
when I'm trying to do,
when I'm doing commentary for the UFC,

1273
01:07:20.201 --> 01:07:24.440
when the fights go to the ground is help people that I know are watching this to

1274
01:07:24.441 --> 01:07:25.970
just see a jumble of bodies.
Yeah.

1275
01:07:26.410 --> 01:07:29.530
Well even sport Jujitsu for people who do Jujitsu is not very entertaining,

1276
01:07:29.531 --> 01:07:32.120
especially with the g with the gates.
Very robbed them.

1277
01:07:32.180 --> 01:07:34.270
It's a real problem because it's kind of boring as fuck.

1278
01:07:34.271 --> 01:07:35.920
Do you think it's gotten to the point?
My Dad and I were talking,

1279
01:07:35.921 --> 01:07:39.850
I mean my dad is sometimes purple belt and he,
um,
that's pretty cool.
He's 55.

1280
01:07:39.851 --> 01:07:41.440
He started in his fifties.
That's awesome.

1281
01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:45.450
And he actually hasn't had a point scored against him.
Really.
Your big guy.

1282
01:07:45.451 --> 01:07:47.860
He's probably a giant,
Huh?
Yeah.
Well he played hockey at u of m.

1283
01:07:48.190 --> 01:07:50.670
He's a real athlete and he stayed in shape.
So we actually,
ah,

1284
01:07:50.671 --> 01:07:52.630
I could bring up at,
I'll show you a video afterwards,
but,

1285
01:07:52.631 --> 01:07:54.790
so he's competed in all the way through blue to get his purple.

1286
01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.790
Not even had a point scored against him.
Wow.
And um,

1287
01:07:57.940 --> 01:08:01.990
his thing though is very strong takedowns top control pass.
And,
uh,

1288
01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:06.310
in practice he'll roll with guys who are doing the reverse della Hiva and all

1289
01:08:06.311 --> 01:08:08.290
this stuff.
And my dad and I believe,

1290
01:08:08.291 --> 01:08:12.370
and I don't know if you think as somebody to taekwondo taekwondo at one point

1291
01:08:12.371 --> 01:08:14.680
where there were some combat relevance and then when you get to the Olympics,

1292
01:08:14.770 --> 01:08:15.880
it's really not anymore.

1293
01:08:15.890 --> 01:08:20.060
I feel like sport Jujitsu was gone in that direction where you have a guy who

1294
01:08:20.061 --> 01:08:24.290
can be the best in the world and a one 25 division with a guy who would get his

1295
01:08:24.291 --> 01:08:27.770
ass kicked by a hockey player in a street fight.
And to me,

1296
01:08:27.830 --> 01:08:31.010
what you sort of lost shot of the hockey player weight 225 pounds.

1297
01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:35.600
A hockey player getting started at 200 is my point.
My Dad,
when he got started,

1298
01:08:35.601 --> 01:08:38.120
he would get look gay over their head because that was the hockey thing.

1299
01:08:39.290 --> 01:08:43.850
You can do that and you can do so I can't you do that.
I think gays are stupid.

1300
01:08:44.030 --> 01:08:45.560
I mean if you can take the collar,

1301
01:08:45.740 --> 01:08:50.030
if you can take someone's fucking the bottom of the jacket and wrap it all the

1302
01:08:50.031 --> 01:08:54.300
way around.
His neck.
Why can't you pull it over the head?
Stupid.
I mean,

1303
01:08:54.590 --> 01:08:56.550
and that's the thing is,
is is it's,

1304
01:08:56.720 --> 01:08:59.300
it's a weird situation you're getting into it and it's no longer really combat

1305
01:08:59.301 --> 01:09:01.190
relevant.
And we have a lot of guys who are,
you know,

1306
01:09:01.191 --> 01:09:04.490
the crossfit thing and all this ridiculous sort of strength training has come

1307
01:09:04.491 --> 01:09:07.190
into it and they're just,
they never get strong am going,
you know,

1308
01:09:07.191 --> 01:09:10.790
like the crossfit thing,
they don't get strong.
What do you mean no cross?

1309
01:09:10.790 --> 01:09:13.660
Well you should have mark Rippetoe on.
He'll,
he'll talk about that.
I mean with,

1310
01:09:13.670 --> 01:09:16.220
with strength training,
you need linear progression.
That's measurable.

1311
01:09:16.221 --> 01:09:18.200
When you're starting guy like you,
right?

1312
01:09:18.201 --> 01:09:21.260
You can do anything now and you're going to,
cause you have a strength base.

1313
01:09:21.470 --> 01:09:25.700
Someone who's never lifted heavyweights and added five pounds incrementally is

1314
01:09:25.701 --> 01:09:29.420
not going to get a lot out of battle ropes and snatches for five minutes.

1315
01:09:29.421 --> 01:09:32.150
He's not going to get a lot out of it.
He needs to increase his maximal strength.

1316
01:09:32.151 --> 01:09:35.360
So we have kids come in like,
no man,
I saw this.
This is what I'm doing.

1317
01:09:35.361 --> 01:09:39.210
It's a new strength thing.
They never get stronger then ever get bigger.
And I,

1318
01:09:39.410 --> 01:09:41.990
we started and my dad is to have this philosophy,

1319
01:09:41.991 --> 01:09:44.150
you start because you want to be a sovereign man.

1320
01:09:44.210 --> 01:09:47.600
You want to be able to defend yourself.
And if you're at a point where you,
you,

1321
01:09:47.730 --> 01:09:51.140
you're double guard pole and you reverse della Hiva and,

1322
01:09:51.141 --> 01:09:55.280
and you're no longer able to actually protect yourself.
I don't know.

1323
01:09:55.281 --> 01:09:58.070
I feel like it's lost.
I mean holy is,
Gracie is a good example.
You know,

1324
01:09:58.071 --> 01:10:00.530
he wouldn't do well in sport Jujitsu,
but he was big enough.

1325
01:10:00.531 --> 01:10:04.580
He was strong enough to get it done and protect himself.
And when altercation,

1326
01:10:04.610 --> 01:10:08.120
well the game has passed him by and a lot of ways,

1327
01:10:08.180 --> 01:10:13.180
but I think that there are a lot of guys in sport Jujitsu that would do great

1328
01:10:13.521 --> 01:10:18.470
like Cyborg,
you know?
Right now Michelle.
Yeah,

1329
01:10:18.620 --> 01:10:22.160
great.
Yeah,
that was a white belt.
Yeah.
Now he's a bad ass.

1330
01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:24.440
There's a lot of really great Jujitsu guys,

1331
01:10:24.441 --> 01:10:26.480
but I agree with you like 50 50 guard.

1332
01:10:26.481 --> 01:10:30.380
There's a lot of silly shit that that guys are doing that just doesn't seem like

1333
01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:33.980
it's also kind of boring to watch,
you know,
and a lot of ways.

1334
01:10:34.130 --> 01:10:37.860
But then there's like no g like Eddie Cummins,
guys like Gary,

1335
01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:41.110
Gary Tonin who are like super aggressive,
very,
you know,

1336
01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:44.510
overly aggressive.
There's a lot of guys,
Marcello Garcia,

1337
01:10:44.511 --> 01:10:48.800
very aggressive submission oriented attacking style.

1338
01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:50.150
So there's,

1339
01:10:50.151 --> 01:10:54.500
there's gonna be guys like in the taekwondo days that just play point style.

1340
01:10:54.710 --> 01:10:55.131
But there's a,

1341
01:10:55.131 --> 01:10:57.920
there was always guys back then they were terrifying because they would not guys

1342
01:10:57.921 --> 01:11:01.040
dead.
You know,
even during my taekwondo competition days,

1343
01:11:01.041 --> 01:11:04.340
I remember there's this guy from the Ivory Coast that everybody was terrified
of.

1344
01:11:04.610 --> 01:11:09.610
His name was Patrice remark because his style of attacking was so much different

1345
01:11:10.041 --> 01:11:12.380
than everybody else's.
Everybody else was playing this sort of,
not everybody,

1346
01:11:12.381 --> 01:11:14.190
but a lot of people playing this sort of point game.

1347
01:11:14.610 --> 01:11:19.610
And this fucking dude was this like shredded black guy from the Ivory Coast kick

1348
01:11:21.001 --> 01:11:24.270
through you from Africa.
She's in Africa.
Africa is fuck.

1349
01:11:24.271 --> 01:11:29.271
He could be a what guy from Africa that the South American accent from Africa.

1350
01:11:32.780 --> 01:11:36.480
Yeah,
that what did the,
it's like a Dutch thing,
right?

1351
01:11:36.481 --> 01:11:40.380
There were Dutch settlers that came to South Africa or South African almost

1352
01:11:40.381 --> 01:11:43.200
sounds like they're faking an Australian accent.
Like a bad comic.

1353
01:11:43.201 --> 01:11:46.840
Like I'm Australian.
Right?
You're like,
Eh,
it's not real.
It's like,
oh,

1354
01:11:46.841 --> 01:11:51.300
it's just South Africa.
Well,
that's when we saw the two collide on lethal weapon.

1355
01:11:51.450 --> 01:11:56.190
Remember Mel Gibson to o had at it with the pot died guide.

1356
01:11:56.191 --> 01:12:00.100
The bite died.
What did he call them?
It Kevin,
what is he saying?

1357
01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:04.980
This was like,
no,
no,
it was down the line,
but they had to like,
he was like,

1358
01:12:04.981 --> 01:12:09.420
Danny Glover was a black guy and he had a bad name for black guy is too old for

1359
01:12:09.421 --> 01:12:12.060
that shit.
You know,
he is too old for that shit.

1360
01:12:13.130 --> 01:12:16.860
I just like when you go back and watch it and you realize that Mel Gibson is

1361
01:12:16.861 --> 01:12:19.740
crazy,
you go back and watch those and you can kind of see the flashes.

1362
01:12:19.741 --> 01:12:21.030
You're like,
oh yeah,
that makes sense.

1363
01:12:21.090 --> 01:12:24.810
But do you think that Mel Gibson got crazy or do you think you always was crazy?

1364
01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:25.950
No,
I think,
I mean

1365
01:12:27.570 --> 01:12:30.330
I've spoken actually with some people who worked in the passion of the Christ

1366
01:12:30.331 --> 01:12:33.070
and I think he got so much heat for that.
Um,

1367
01:12:33.150 --> 01:12:35.280
I mean you talk about sort of like social justice warriors.

1368
01:12:35.281 --> 01:12:39.090
He got so many people who went after him and I just don't think he was expecting

1369
01:12:39.091 --> 01:12:42.390
are used to that kind of pressure I think.
Have you ever heard of the voicemails?

1370
01:12:43.230 --> 01:12:47.220
Oh yeah.
To me that is the funniest thing I've ever heard in my life.
Well,

1371
01:12:47.250 --> 01:12:50.700
it's funny to me,
but it's sad because he's an old guy.

1372
01:12:50.701 --> 01:12:53.760
He's dating this Russian assassin,
you know,

1373
01:12:53.761 --> 01:12:56.640
and she's stealing has come and we're making babies and

1374
01:12:58.430 --> 01:13:01.290
as he's like off the wall,
angry,
right?
For people who haven't heard it,

1375
01:13:01.291 --> 01:13:03.410
shut up and blow married,

1376
01:13:05.340 --> 01:13:08.520
he starts yelling at my friend and I said,
okay,
listen,
listen.
And I cue it up.

1377
01:13:08.521 --> 01:13:09.710
I let people listen for context.
I go,

1378
01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:11.040
this is the funniest thing you'll ever hear.

1379
01:13:11.041 --> 01:13:14.340
And no one laughs except for me and my producer,
gay Jared,
where he's like,

1380
01:13:14.550 --> 01:13:17.200
you have no show.
You have no,

1381
01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:24.270
but I will give you one more chance.
And I don't know why.

1382
01:13:24.271 --> 01:13:26.460
I just find like anyone who's been through a breakup or you're like,

1383
01:13:26.461 --> 01:13:30.020
I want to tell her off but I want to make it work,
want to sell it.

1384
01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:33.540
I will give you one more chance.
And she goes,
I don't want another chance.

1385
01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:38.730
It just goes crazy and it to me it just like the pain.

1386
01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:41.850
Do I think it was horrible,
the things he said.
Yeah,

1387
01:13:41.851 --> 01:13:45.030
but anyone who's been in like one of those horrible breakups and you feel like

1388
01:13:45.031 --> 01:13:49.830
you're not being heard has felt that anger and then he tries to pull it back.
Oh,

1389
01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:53.360
we'll give you one more Jeannine's better friends.
Well Robert Downey's,

1390
01:13:53.370 --> 01:13:56.670
his best friend.
Really?
Yeah,
they're close friends.
Robert Downey Jr.

1391
01:13:56.730 --> 01:13:59.010
That's what he said.
He came out and introduced him at some award thing.

1392
01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:03.170
Interesting.
I wonder if Robert Downey junior hates the Jews as well.

1393
01:14:05.370 --> 01:14:07.620
I don't think he'll come out and say it because Mel Gibson,

1394
01:14:07.621 --> 01:14:11.070
you just get a couple of cocktails into him and apparently he just starts hating

1395
01:14:11.140 --> 01:14:15.150
Jews.
It's just,
oh well that's,
I don't think about the cocktail over,

1396
01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:17.840
make them hate.
No,
but that's what gets it out of them.

1397
01:14:18.550 --> 01:14:21.430
People that got him pulled over in Malibu,
the cops that pulled them over.

1398
01:14:21.431 --> 01:14:22.930
We're saying he's just fucking spout,

1399
01:14:22.931 --> 01:14:26.050
not all this fucking anti stuff called the one cop sugar tits.

1400
01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:29.860
I'll think of kite.
I don't know.
I don't know why I find it really funny.

1401
01:14:30.100 --> 01:14:32.320
I know it's terrible and people will us up against me.

1402
01:14:32.321 --> 01:14:33.610
It's an example of being racist.

1403
01:14:33.611 --> 01:14:38.500
I just find that pain funny because everyone's felt it and then he tries to pull

1404
01:14:38.501 --> 01:14:40.360
it back.
Oh,
give me one watch

1405
01:14:42.650 --> 01:14:46.270
in my head.
It is funny because my,

1406
01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:48.220
the pain of everything you just said,

1407
01:14:48.221 --> 01:14:51.910
you hope she gets raped by a pack of and word.
Oh,
that's right.

1408
01:14:51.911 --> 01:14:56.680
I forgot about that part.
It's a pack of wild and words,

1409
01:14:56.830 --> 01:15:00.470
right?
Wasn't it like they're just roaming through like that's what they do.
Yeah,

1410
01:15:00.471 --> 01:15:04.200
like,
like fucking lions.
And then,
but you know what though?

1411
01:15:04.210 --> 01:15:08.950
The crazy thing is you don't know that he hates black people.
No,

1412
01:15:08.980 --> 01:15:11.240
he could have like,
you know,
I'm Michael Richards.
Well,

1413
01:15:11.241 --> 01:15:13.930
you sit in those movies with Danny Glover.
They seem to get along wonderfully.

1414
01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:16.300
And that's one thing I've talked about with people.
People go,
oh,

1415
01:15:16.301 --> 01:15:18.670
you're going to have a black friend.
Now here's,
here's the thing.

1416
01:15:19.270 --> 01:15:22.600
If you have a lot of black friends,
my black friends over for dinner,
do I,

1417
01:15:23.230 --> 01:15:27.160
aside from Tony Camacho?
Yes.
Uh,
yeah.
Plenty of black friends.

1418
01:15:27.820 --> 01:15:31.620
But those last time black,
I was over your house for dinner.
Probably been in,
why

1419
01:15:34.580 --> 01:15:37.210
you're coming back telling me about some black guy shot someone at the comedy

1420
01:15:37.211 --> 01:15:39.700
store and then you can put me on the hot seat and have a black guy home for

1421
01:15:39.701 --> 01:15:42.010
dinner.
Well,
I don't know what you're saying.
Was it grass fed?

1422
01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:45.550
Did you feed them grass fed grass?
I don't know otherwise.
I don't know.

1423
01:15:45.551 --> 01:15:48.880
I just like bring out the corn fed steak.
He's a negro.
I mean,

1424
01:15:48.881 --> 01:15:50.200
what do you think about it?
Bad steak.

1425
01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:55.600
You are all in the grass fed corn fed beef to really?
Yeah.
It's not bad.

1426
01:15:55.601 --> 01:15:59.500
It's fatty.
Sometimes it tastes delicious.
Nice corn fed.
Prime Rib.

1427
01:15:59.770 --> 01:16:02.170
I don't have the Joe Rogan salary.
So it's mostly corn fed.

1428
01:16:02.350 --> 01:16:05.770
Well his grasp it that much more expensive.
Oh my gosh.
It's so much more.

1429
01:16:05.850 --> 01:16:08.380
Some money.
Although I've been,
I've never hunted,
but I was,

1430
01:16:08.410 --> 01:16:12.840
my uncle in law has a cider mill up in northern Michigan and um,

1431
01:16:13.090 --> 01:16:16.450
all the deer just keep eating samples.
So he was like,
listen,
I have a permit.

1432
01:16:16.540 --> 01:16:18.010
Something absurd.
I don't know the number,

1433
01:16:18.011 --> 01:16:20.890
like to kill like five a month or something because they're just constantly

1434
01:16:20.891 --> 01:16:23.680
eating his apple so that you want to come up.
And I was like,
I mean,

1435
01:16:23.681 --> 01:16:24.221
I'm not a hunter,

1436
01:16:24.221 --> 01:16:27.880
but I could literally just sit there in a lawn chair with my three 57 take a

1437
01:16:27.881 --> 01:16:31.600
couple of them out while they're eating some Fujis and 57 yeah,

1438
01:16:31.601 --> 01:16:33.520
they changed the law.
You can hunt with handgun cartridges,

1439
01:16:33.590 --> 01:16:37.370
but you don't want to be seven out of a rifle.
Oh.

1440
01:16:37.540 --> 01:16:40.780
As ballistics that are higher than mid caliber rifle stuff.
Old Rifles,

1441
01:16:40.781 --> 01:16:42.460
just more accurate.
That's what I'm saying.
Yeah.

1442
01:16:42.461 --> 01:16:45.160
But out of a six inch barrel handgun,
three of you,
seven,

1443
01:16:45.190 --> 01:16:46.970
you're actually gonna get really surprising bliss,

1444
01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:48.610
but you'd have to be really close.

1445
01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:51.700
They're going to eat a red delicious right in front of me.

1446
01:16:51.701 --> 01:16:54.040
I'll be in a lawn chair with I probably from me to you.

1447
01:16:54.041 --> 01:16:56.740
These things love the apples.
That's the point.
That close.
Yeah.

1448
01:16:56.741 --> 01:16:58.240
They just eat the apples.
They go nuts.

1449
01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:02.070
I'm P and all over the cider orchard property cause apparently it helps and you

1450
01:17:02.071 --> 01:17:03.190
just like,
listen,
you want to kill them.

1451
01:17:03.460 --> 01:17:06.730
I know a guy who will process and write down the road.
It's delicious meat.

1452
01:17:06.790 --> 01:17:10.040
Especially if they're eating animals.
I just don't know how to cut out the anus.

1453
01:17:10.450 --> 01:17:14.050
It's not hard.
It's,
it makes me nervous.
If you know how to operate a microphone,

1454
01:17:14.060 --> 01:17:17.150
you can figure that out.
I don't think I've done a stellar job of that today.

1455
01:17:17.180 --> 01:17:21.710
I'm not used to yet.
So not hard.
But um,
yeah,

1456
01:17:21.711 --> 01:17:24.650
gutting them.
It just,
you get used to,
it becomes normal.

1457
01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:27.230
You understand where to go and how to turn it around and well,

1458
01:17:27.231 --> 01:17:30.380
they've opened it up in Michigan because it's just a real problem for eating

1459
01:17:30.381 --> 01:17:33.320
everything.
We pulled it up the other day.
Um,

1460
01:17:33.350 --> 01:17:38.350
there was a number of the amount of driving accidents involving deer,

1461
01:17:38.930 --> 01:17:43.880
deer hit in Michigan and in more than 40,000 would it pull that up again,
Jamie?

1462
01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:48.080
I won't ride the motorcycle and the out there in any rural area with a deer,

1463
01:17:48.140 --> 01:17:51.380
it's insane.
I mean,
people who live in urban environments,

1464
01:17:51.381 --> 01:17:53.570
they get upset at hunting.
They don't understand.

1465
01:17:53.630 --> 01:17:56.590
You literally don't understand these animals.

1466
01:17:56.591 --> 01:18:01.490
I have vastly overpopulated to the point where they bring in hunters in suburban

1467
01:18:01.491 --> 01:18:04.610
Pennsylvania because they have no,
they have no limits.

1468
01:18:04.611 --> 01:18:07.740
You can shoot as many as you want all day long,
all year long.
And they,

1469
01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:12.150
they bring people in.
Just a bar.
A lot of parts of Pennsylvania.
Um,

1470
01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:14.630
I don't know specifically which counties,
but I know that these guys,

1471
01:18:14.631 --> 01:18:15.680
and I know that her bow hunters,

1472
01:18:15.980 --> 01:18:20.040
they fly them out to Pennsylvania and they film shows whether they're

1473
01:18:20.090 --> 01:18:23.300
essentially in these fucking people's yards and they have,

1474
01:18:23.330 --> 01:18:26.150
they set up tree stands and I'm not kidding you,
but it's a nice yard.

1475
01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:30.860
But suburban neighborhood,
nice houses.
It is,
it's a,
it's a home,

1476
01:18:31.110 --> 01:18:33.840
like that's got like several acres,
like two or three acres in there.

1477
01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:38.090
They have tree stands set up and they're just killing as many deer is.

1478
01:18:38.091 --> 01:18:40.190
Walk their way.
I can imagine.
Yeah.
The,

1479
01:18:40.191 --> 01:18:43.520
and they have to because the driving accidents are fucking crazy.

1480
01:18:43.521 --> 01:18:48.200
So many people hit them.
Yeah.
I just three 57 is my,
my guts.
Your gun of choice.

1481
01:18:48.350 --> 01:18:51.500
Why is that?
Sounds good.
Yeah.

1482
01:18:51.650 --> 01:18:56.180
It sounds like three 57 handgun out of a four inch barrel is going to have

1483
01:18:56.181 --> 01:19:00.590
better ballistics than any other caliber,
uh,
for self defense.

1484
01:19:00.620 --> 01:19:04.850
And the reason why is I have a giant bucket of 38 and giant bucket of 30 sevens

1485
01:19:05.150 --> 01:19:07.280
with Lever Action Rifles,
different handguns.

1486
01:19:07.281 --> 01:19:09.230
And my wife doesn't need to worry about what goes into where.

1487
01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.370
And I have a beautiful,
like almost collector's item,

1488
01:19:13.371 --> 01:19:17.900
an old three 57 Smith and Wesson.
It's an old one from where?
Smith and Western.

1489
01:19:17.901 --> 01:19:21.110
It's like an eight,
maybe like how long?
It's not that,

1490
01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:26.000
but it's before they have the,
um,
the internal lock and it's nickel plated.

1491
01:19:26.010 --> 01:19:29.180
It's just beautiful.
It's my favorite,
like the trigger on that thing.

1492
01:19:29.210 --> 01:19:33.500
It's just butter smooth.
Here's the number average of 134.

1493
01:19:33.501 --> 01:19:38.330
Dear vehicle crashes each day.
Holy Shit.

1494
01:19:39.230 --> 01:19:40.460
Holy Shit.

1495
01:19:40.820 --> 01:19:45.820
That's Michigan resulted in 1,329 injuries in eight deaths.

1496
01:19:48.230 --> 01:19:52.700
Wow.
Just kill those things.
Yeah.
While there their food,
you know,

1497
01:19:52.701 --> 01:19:55.100
that's the thing about them.
You know,

1498
01:19:55.110 --> 01:19:59.840
I've never been on any of that joke too out.
You should.
It's not,
it's not bad.

1499
01:19:59.870 --> 01:20:02.890
It's fun to do.
I don't think at all that they want to say that it's,

1500
01:20:03.170 --> 01:20:05.720
people don't want to say it's fun for some reason.
I don't understand that.

1501
01:20:06.070 --> 01:20:10.920
Like it's ethical and it's fun.
It is fun.
Why denied that?
It's fun.
It's fun.

1502
01:20:10.921 --> 01:20:13.530
The shift.
Productive.
Yeah.
It is definitely productive.

1503
01:20:13.531 --> 01:20:15.090
Certainly more productive than shooting at the range.

1504
01:20:15.300 --> 01:20:20.300
Well it's especially if you want to eat healthy meat that's natural and organic

1505
01:20:20.580 --> 01:20:24.700
and especially if you want to help control the population of these animals and

1506
01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:27.210
because there's only one of the way you're gonna bring in wolves.

1507
01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:29.400
When are you going to bring in mountain lions and have them run through the

1508
01:20:29.401 --> 01:20:31.050
streets of Pennsylvania?
Come on.

1509
01:20:31.220 --> 01:20:33.960
I mean you don't really have a lot of other options for controlling the

1510
01:20:33.961 --> 01:20:38.040
populations of these fucking animals.
We'd a bobcat in our yard and a hopper.

1511
01:20:38.060 --> 01:20:41.950
Our dog,
like when after that thing.
Cool looking.
They're cool.
They look weird.

1512
01:20:41.951 --> 01:20:43.740
You can't catch it,
but he would have messed it up.

1513
01:20:43.741 --> 01:20:46.170
I had one of those my ARD wants.
It was the weirdest thing.
I was like,

1514
01:20:46.171 --> 01:20:47.760
what is that fucking cat?

1515
01:20:47.820 --> 01:20:51.090
I have like the Wolverine Ghana thing that has like the tips of their ears are

1516
01:20:51.091 --> 01:20:55.090
like fucking weird looking.
I was like,
what is that?
Yeah,
it's very strange.
Look,

1517
01:20:55.140 --> 01:20:59.070
their back legs look longer than they should be.
Yeah.
It's a weird sort of,

1518
01:20:59.071 --> 01:21:02.610
it's a,
it's a weird sort of body dynamic,
but,
uh,
yeah,

1519
01:21:02.820 --> 01:21:06.030
our dog went nuts for it.
And if he,
if he'd have been able to catch it,

1520
01:21:06.031 --> 01:21:09.270
it would've killed him.
He would have killed it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well,

1521
01:21:09.350 --> 01:21:13.860
how big is your dog is a dog.
Oh,
okay.
That's a big fucking dog.
Yeah.
Well,

1522
01:21:13.861 --> 01:21:17.520
I think Ronda Rousey has one.
He's a little bigger and he was a rescue.

1523
01:21:17.820 --> 01:21:20.520
That's not,
that's nothing for perfect example of leftist and animal rights.

1524
01:21:20.521 --> 01:21:25.230
Like we have a rescue came to us with a broken leg,
balding Lyme disease.

1525
01:21:25.470 --> 01:21:28.140
You know,
look,
he wasn't the perfect dog.

1526
01:21:28.230 --> 01:21:31.800
We've basically brought him back to health.
I volunteered at shelters,

1527
01:21:32.010 --> 01:21:35.670
helped with them.
But you know what I also tell people,
if you have kids,

1528
01:21:35.970 --> 01:21:37.590
you probably shouldn't adopt a dog.

1529
01:21:37.950 --> 01:21:40.920
You probably should get it from a puppy and rage and know about that dog.

1530
01:21:41.720 --> 01:21:45.510
He's perfect for us.
He's a little bit racist.
I'm not going to lie.
I don't know.

1531
01:21:46.710 --> 01:21:50.160
And he's a white dog.
He's started by his racist.
You know,
it's funny.

1532
01:21:50.161 --> 01:21:54.840
He loves black men.
Uh,
women's towards black boys,
Black Pole,

1533
01:21:54.841 --> 01:21:58.950
like 12 year old black boys.
He just,
he just like,
he just little leery.
Ooh.

1534
01:21:59.010 --> 01:22:00.960
Specifically them and he's not aggressive so he just,

1535
01:22:00.961 --> 01:22:03.600
but you just see he wants to be pet by everyone.
He's the most friendly pack,

1536
01:22:03.601 --> 01:22:07.470
ranted dog,
younger black boys.
He's like,
wow.

1537
01:22:07.490 --> 01:22:08.880
And he's all white so that's all.

1538
01:22:08.881 --> 01:22:12.030
There are a lot of dogs that are fucking sketchy as hell around kids.

1539
01:22:12.300 --> 01:22:16.380
I had a friend who had a pit bull that was really sketchy around kids and it's

1540
01:22:16.381 --> 01:22:20.610
just,
he had never been around kids and kids to him looked like little animals.

1541
01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:23.760
Like you didn't understand what they were.
Well it's unstable.
Yeah.

1542
01:22:23.820 --> 01:22:26.230
Our dog actually hopper,
he's a,

1543
01:22:26.231 --> 01:22:28.890
if my wife and I argue at all or for ranting about our day,

1544
01:22:28.891 --> 01:22:32.040
like I have to be careful when I do the radio show.
He'll sit in the corner,

1545
01:22:32.070 --> 01:22:36.150
look in the corner and shake.
He gets upset,
he gets a bit,
it'll actually shake.

1546
01:22:36.180 --> 01:22:39.690
Oh,
so like he was abused.
He just,
when we pulled out a musket for video,

1547
01:22:39.691 --> 01:22:43.890
but it like never before in front of him.
He pulled it out barking like crazy,

1548
01:22:43.891 --> 01:22:46.950
showing us to foaming at the mouth with the Moscow.
So we don't know.

1549
01:22:46.951 --> 01:22:49.780
You know you're 70 scene and you're,
if you're a kid and you're playing,

1550
01:22:51.830 --> 01:22:53.400
it's like the woman who had her face ripped off.

1551
01:22:54.180 --> 01:22:57.930
I had a female rescue dog that you,
if you raised your voice,

1552
01:22:57.931 --> 01:23:01.020
she would just drop to the ground and cower.
You couldn't say,

1553
01:23:01.021 --> 01:23:03.340
what are you doing over there?
Ooh,
right.
He just,

1554
01:23:03.390 --> 01:23:06.790
she had been beaten and the other dogs that I had from time,
they're puppies.

1555
01:23:06.791 --> 01:23:09.010
I'm like,
what the fuck's going on with her?
Yeah,
he's just Christ.

1556
01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:14.290
Do you know how this house works?
Exactly.
You have to.

1557
01:23:14.291 --> 01:23:18.100
Um,
but we actually tried to rescue another dog and a lady wouldn't give it to us

1558
01:23:18.101 --> 01:23:21.580
because she found out my politics and true still.
Oh,
come on.

1559
01:23:21.581 --> 01:23:26.430
I swear to you what come on really?
Dog's name is Mister Beg.

1560
01:23:26.431 --> 01:23:30.850
I wonder how he's probably a crazy cut.
What she is.
She was,

1561
01:23:31.150 --> 01:23:34.330
she was a super hippie and she was looking for a reason.

1562
01:23:34.331 --> 01:23:38.530
And so like it was this shelter where you have to go in for a whole weekend and

1563
01:23:38.531 --> 01:23:40.060
learn all these dogs.
So it was actually,

1564
01:23:40.061 --> 01:23:43.000
I ended up volunteering and this one dog,
everyone was scared of,

1565
01:23:43.030 --> 01:23:44.620
he was like an American bulldog mix,

1566
01:23:44.621 --> 01:23:48.490
so he's about 120 pounds called mister big and he would just fall at the mouth

1567
01:23:48.491 --> 01:23:51.760
and be barking up that,
you know,
at the,
um,
he recalled his fence.
Yeah.

1568
01:23:51.761 --> 01:23:54.490
But they all have their own individual runs in this one and you just go in.

1569
01:23:54.491 --> 01:23:58.150
He's just excited.
So no one wanted to take him out that he was just great.

1570
01:23:58.450 --> 01:24:02.260
And um,
what really got her mad was we had to watch like this dog training video,

1571
01:24:02.910 --> 01:24:04.990
how to learn dog body language.

1572
01:24:04.991 --> 01:24:08.200
And you had a little like writing comes in like an early nineties,
a VHS.

1573
01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:10.540
And I went out and she'd say,
what'd you think of the,

1574
01:24:10.570 --> 01:24:12.220
what'd you think of the source material?
I said,

1575
01:24:12.460 --> 01:24:15.100
you've got to love that early 90 saved by the bell font.
Right.

1576
01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:20.320
She like wrote something down and she was furious because you made fun of the

1577
01:24:20.321 --> 01:24:21.280
font.
I don't know.

1578
01:24:21.281 --> 01:24:23.590
I just know I didn't get your dog like that dog could have had a house.

1579
01:24:23.620 --> 01:24:25.840
We're happy with their dog,
but you know,
it breaks my heart to think of them.

1580
01:24:25.930 --> 01:24:29.530
But how do you know that it was about your politics?
That's what she said.
Well,

1581
01:24:29.590 --> 01:24:33.180
she said because when there was no valid reason,
um,

1582
01:24:33.190 --> 01:24:37.030
because we know the owner of that place,
she said,
uh,
well I just,
you know,
I get,

1583
01:24:37.510 --> 01:24:39.460
I get to choose who gets what dog and that's just,

1584
01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:42.430
he's just not the right dog for them.
I wouldn't give them any dog.
What she said,

1585
01:24:42.550 --> 01:24:44.200
I wouldn't give them any dog.
Well,

1586
01:24:44.201 --> 01:24:47.080
how did she know that she like Google you and yeah.

1587
01:24:47.410 --> 01:24:50.200
Well I came in and the guy who owns it was a fan,

1588
01:24:50.450 --> 01:24:52.820
said I was like this multimillionaire who just kind of a fan and he,

1589
01:24:52.821 --> 01:24:55.360
I think he probably let her know or something and she was,
oh,

1590
01:24:55.361 --> 01:24:59.110
so he's a fan of yours,
but she works for him and she's not a fan,

1591
01:24:59.111 --> 01:25:03.190
but she gets the ultimate decision.
He's very hands off with that.
Yeah.
Wow.

1592
01:25:03.490 --> 01:25:05.680
But weird.
He's a great guy.
He's a great guy,

1593
01:25:05.681 --> 01:25:09.940
actually is this multimillionaire and uh,
people just hate him where we are.

1594
01:25:09.941 --> 01:25:13.840
And you just meet him and he's like,
he's made all of his money.
What's crazy,

1595
01:25:13.841 --> 01:25:16.660
and this is sort of something we don't tell kids.
I talk with people about this.

1596
01:25:16.661 --> 01:25:17.471
We said,
well,
what do you want to pay?

1597
01:25:17.471 --> 01:25:20.500
I'm going to be a firefighter now you need to ask him what kind of a lifestyle

1598
01:25:20.501 --> 01:25:21.334
do you want to live?

1599
01:25:21.430 --> 01:25:24.340
Because this guy's made all of his money off of Burger Patty machines,

1600
01:25:25.810 --> 01:25:30.490
machines and multimodal like,
no kid goes,
Alan,
I make Burger Patty machines.

1601
01:25:30.550 --> 01:25:32.110
But you know,
you say,
hey,

1602
01:25:32.111 --> 01:25:35.660
you want to never have a boss and have a bank account with tens of millions of

1603
01:25:35.660 --> 01:25:37.660
dollars and that feels pretty good.
Burger Patty machines.

1604
01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:39.940
Well this guy's already got the market cornered though.

1605
01:25:39.940 --> 01:25:43.720
Maybe tell him something else.
Yeah.
You know,
I don't know.
Hot Don machine.

1606
01:25:43.721 --> 01:25:46.260
How many more fucking people can make Burger Patty machines?

1607
01:25:46.440 --> 01:25:48.640
Imagine if you come along with a new one,
you know,

1608
01:25:48.641 --> 01:25:51.790
he'll fucking box out of the business.
He probably could listen,

1609
01:25:51.820 --> 01:25:55.300
it's the 1% kid saying,
I got this market cone.

1610
01:25:55.301 --> 01:25:58.810
It may be you need to make hot dog machines,
but you know,
it's a perfect example.

1611
01:25:58.811 --> 01:26:01.210
He's rich,
we're supposed to hate him and he's a great guy and he's been,

1612
01:26:01.211 --> 01:26:04.580
you know,
he runs this giant non killed dog and he's just like,

1613
01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:08.480
but everyone just hates him.
Okay,
you some people,
yeah,

1614
01:26:08.481 --> 01:26:11.810
you're supposed to hate wealthy folks that are famous or that are successful
are,

1615
01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:15.020
unless they're actors,
unless they're actors,
then you're not.
Well,

1616
01:26:15.021 --> 01:26:17.540
actors talk about the wealthiest 1% and you know,

1617
01:26:17.630 --> 01:26:19.910
they go out and they talk about the people,
but they don't care.

1618
01:26:20.090 --> 01:26:22.640
They are the 1% of course,
a lot of ways you're the one,

1619
01:26:22.820 --> 01:26:27.080
you're the top 1% of the top 1% of 1% well,
here's what's really crazy.

1620
01:26:27.081 --> 01:26:31.400
If you make more than $34,000 a year,
you're in the 1% of the world.
Yeah.

1621
01:26:31.430 --> 01:26:36.080
You know what,
your 1% in the United States,
what?
500,000 annual family income,

1622
01:26:36.230 --> 01:26:40.100
you know it's top 10% 150,000 annual household income.
Whoa.

1623
01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:43.190
So we're actually have it with video going up right now at the site today,

1624
01:26:43.191 --> 01:26:46.390
we're actually launching an ar 15 giveaway and we have a video on Bernie said,

1625
01:26:46.430 --> 01:26:50.090
yeah,
we're giving him away folks.
Sorry,
can I get you a show to play ar fifteens?

1626
01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:52.790
Yeah.
Did you believe in background checks?
Think yeah,
yeah,

1627
01:26:52.791 --> 01:26:55.370
we do all that and actually it's done through ar fifteen.com and they sell

1628
01:26:55.371 --> 01:26:58.800
custom.
Well of course you at 15 doing it legally,
you have to have back on shit.

1629
01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:00.470
But I'm going to have your politics.

1630
01:27:00.471 --> 01:27:04.310
Do you think that with our background checks?
Yes.
Right.
That's fine.

1631
01:27:04.660 --> 01:27:07.910
You don't have a problem with the gun show loophole.
What's that?

1632
01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:11.120
Is that what you're talking about?
The gun show loophole.
What?
Gun show loop.
Oh,

1633
01:27:11.150 --> 01:27:13.850
well that's it.
That is an interesting loophole.
You know,

1634
01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:15.740
you can sell guns to people.

1635
01:27:15.741 --> 01:27:18.270
People explaining the gun show loophole for people don't understand this.

1636
01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:20.420
You know,
they say with a background check at a gun show,

1637
01:27:20.421 --> 01:27:22.520
there's a loophole and you can get a gun without a background check.

1638
01:27:22.730 --> 01:27:23.563
Here's the thing.

1639
01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:28.550
I think it was Charles Cook who was one of those cable news networks.
Sorry,

1640
01:27:28.551 --> 01:27:30.500
I have to Burp.
Want to have to go ahead.
Go ahead.

1641
01:27:31.100 --> 01:27:33.920
I don't have a cough button here,
Leah.
It's quiet burp.
Yeah.

1642
01:27:33.921 --> 01:27:37.220
This show is real as fuck.
We don't,
we don't believe in,

1643
01:27:37.290 --> 01:27:39.680
we'll get them and actually we're going to probably put a cough button.

1644
01:27:39.700 --> 01:27:42.170
We're going to do that.
We do.
We decided that yet we didn't really decide.

1645
01:27:42.380 --> 01:27:45.830
We're thinking about putting a cop out in the next studio that helps me zero

1646
01:27:45.831 --> 01:27:49.610
right now.
Sorry.
Yeah.
Just talking to them.
My thing is with the gun issue,

1647
01:27:49.700 --> 01:27:52.820
what people don't,
it's about the hit,
the intrinsic right to self preservation.

1648
01:27:53.420 --> 01:27:57.230
So a good example is you don't have,
you asked me if I did stand up.

1649
01:27:57.231 --> 01:27:59.800
I don't do a ton of it anymore,
but I have one next week.
Um,

1650
01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:04.100
when I do any live performance now there has to be armed security and some kind

1651
01:28:04.101 --> 01:28:07.030
of a gate.
It's just the way it is.
Same thing with someone like Ann Coulter,

1652
01:28:07.060 --> 01:28:09.620
Miley Annapolis.
You don't just get to go up and do standup anymore,

1653
01:28:09.650 --> 01:28:13.280
but Milo does.
He shows up at slut walks.
Yeah,
I do that too.

1654
01:28:13.281 --> 01:28:16.550
But that's different from an announced show on a schedule where people can,

1655
01:28:16.780 --> 01:28:18.980
can show up to show that you're going to be there.

1656
01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:23.660
You have armed security always at all of your shows.
I do it.
Yeah.
Why is that?

1657
01:28:23.990 --> 01:28:24.860
Because it's crazy.

1658
01:28:24.861 --> 01:28:27.560
Death threats and I don't talk about it a lot cause you ever want me to a person

1659
01:28:27.561 --> 01:28:30.650
like Lena Dunham?
I got a death threat because I showed my nipple.

1660
01:28:31.010 --> 01:28:33.180
It's like legit when you question is,
well,

1661
01:28:33.181 --> 01:28:35.530
I'm going to do those videos and you're on cares watch list.

1662
01:28:35.531 --> 01:28:36.470
Do you have to be careful?
Well,

1663
01:28:36.471 --> 01:28:41.471
you did a video that was pretty fucking ballsy where you showed the actual

1664
01:28:41.901 --> 01:28:45.530
history of Muhammad as opposed to the history of Jesus.

1665
01:28:45.531 --> 01:28:49.230
Like the differences between the Christian religion,
the Islamic religion,
right.

1666
01:28:49.610 --> 01:28:53.030
It's pretty,
pretty ballsy.
And when you did that,
is that when,

1667
01:28:53.080 --> 01:28:56.870
what was before that?
That was a sequel.
That was the foreign challenge too.

1668
01:28:57.410 --> 01:28:59.990
And I remember this was before I was at Fox News.

1669
01:28:59.991 --> 01:29:03.600
I called Andrew Breitbart the first one,
and I put it up,
I go in this,
there's,

1670
01:29:03.610 --> 01:29:05.700
there's some,
there's some backlash.
Andrew,
can you help me?
He goes,

1671
01:29:05.701 --> 01:29:08.610
I'm going to get it to the online guy at fuck.
And he said,
when you're dead,

1672
01:29:08.611 --> 01:29:12.270
it's a story kid.
And he hung up the phone.
What?
That's what he says,
what he said.

1673
01:29:13.500 --> 01:29:15.090
Yeah,
that's right.
The second one.

1674
01:29:15.091 --> 01:29:18.040
But I mean even you as someone who doesn't subscribe to either faith,
you know,

1675
01:29:18.060 --> 01:29:20.260
my whole point is you can point to imperfect people.

1676
01:29:20.290 --> 01:29:23.370
Then any side of the spectrum,
but go to the founders.

1677
01:29:23.371 --> 01:29:26.610
And there's a huge difference with Muhammad.
So we actually showed,
um,

1678
01:29:26.670 --> 01:29:30.060
you know what,
a six year old,
nine year old girl looks like,
who was white was,

1679
01:29:30.270 --> 01:29:32.610
it's not the same as a 14 year olds,
which was normal.

1680
01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:37.070
Well you showed a girl that was actually older than his wife.
Yes.
Yeah,
yeah.

1681
01:29:37.930 --> 01:29:39.150
When you're on set,
when she showed,

1682
01:29:39.270 --> 01:29:43.980
I think so she was like 10 and actually her dad is really into Jitsu guy who

1683
01:29:43.981 --> 01:29:47.150
runs a school in Dallas is kind of fucked up when you,

1684
01:29:47.180 --> 01:29:52.180
you stop and think about the history of a lot of religious stories.

1685
01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:55.740
I mean if you go back and think about what was acceptable,
you know,

1686
01:29:55.741 --> 01:30:00.240
2000 years ago,
a thousand years ago,
1500 year,
whatever it was,
it's,
it's,

1687
01:30:00.390 --> 01:30:03.030
you're talking about a completely different era,
you know,

1688
01:30:03.031 --> 01:30:07.440
and that's one of the problems with enforcing a lot of religious scripture
today.

1689
01:30:07.710 --> 01:30:10.690
You know,
like this is many things that people do in the by.

1690
01:30:10.710 --> 01:30:13.820
My favorite is religious people that get tattoos.
And I'm like,
look,

1691
01:30:13.830 --> 01:30:15.570
if you're a Christian,
you get a tattoo.
You just,

1692
01:30:15.740 --> 01:30:18.480
you've got to read the whole book.
Okay.
Cause you're not supposed to get tattoos.

1693
01:30:18.540 --> 01:30:21.090
Well No,
they would say they would argue that Christ came to,
you know,

1694
01:30:21.420 --> 01:30:22.620
change the law to abolish loss.

1695
01:30:22.621 --> 01:30:27.510
They're not beholden to some of the dietary laws or the fabric laws.
Bacon.
Bacon.

1696
01:30:27.511 --> 01:30:30.870
Yeah,
exactly.
That fabric,
the fabric,
Lothian Abic laws,

1697
01:30:31.990 --> 01:30:34.670
two different types of cloth.
Do you understand why that exists?
Uh,

1698
01:30:34.710 --> 01:30:38.040
I would assume the fabric law has to do with the people that we're constructing.

1699
01:30:38.041 --> 01:30:42.840
The fabrics back then that they had like no gang wars between silk and cotton.

1700
01:30:42.910 --> 01:30:45.600
No,
no.
Kind of.
But what it was a big reason for that.

1701
01:30:45.601 --> 01:30:48.060
You have certain laws that were applicable to everyone,

1702
01:30:48.061 --> 01:30:51.270
like the 10 commandments and then you had laws that were designed to separate

1703
01:30:51.330 --> 01:30:54.750
the Jewish people.
That's like a team Jersey.
Cause everyone else is doing this.

1704
01:30:54.751 --> 01:30:58.100
So your beard is going to be this way.
Your fabrics going to be this way now.

1705
01:30:58.101 --> 01:31:01.080
So that's where brilliant theologians far smarter than myself.
I said,
well,

1706
01:31:01.081 --> 01:31:04.230
this is why these laws apply in.
These thoughts don't.
But my point is,

1707
01:31:04.590 --> 01:31:06.600
I don't have a problem with,
you know,
like Tom Cruise,

1708
01:31:06.601 --> 01:31:09.470
I haven't stood up when he would like,
he jumped on a couch.
I don't really care.

1709
01:31:09.470 --> 01:31:13.170
He's a little nutty.
Whatever.
Um,
was I have to do with religion?
Well,

1710
01:31:13.171 --> 01:31:16.020
Scientology and was going to sign it out,
but it's drinking on the couch.

1711
01:31:16.030 --> 01:31:18.450
Did you think that,
my point is,
a lot of people said,
you know,

1712
01:31:18.500 --> 01:31:21.540
Scientology's messed him up.
I don't have a problem with Scientology.

1713
01:31:21.541 --> 01:31:23.550
I don't have a problem with Buddhism.
Hinduism,
I don't,

1714
01:31:23.700 --> 01:31:27.360
there is one religion right now in this world.
One religion.

1715
01:31:27.361 --> 01:31:31.230
We're over 300 million people right now on earth.
Deserve that.

1716
01:31:31.500 --> 01:31:35.460
Believe that you deserve to die if you leave the Islamic faith.
They,

1717
01:31:35.461 --> 01:31:37.140
these are the people who will answer.
Yes.

1718
01:31:37.141 --> 01:31:41.310
When you say if someone converts from Islam,
do they deserve to be executed?
Yes.

1719
01:31:41.340 --> 01:31:44.700
Over 300 million people in the world right now.

1720
01:31:44.940 --> 01:31:46.620
So when you say it's like a small minority,

1721
01:31:46.621 --> 01:31:48.510
it's because you live this privileged life.

1722
01:31:48.511 --> 01:31:50.520
Ironically enough in the United States.

1723
01:31:50.790 --> 01:31:53.220
And you're not acknowledging the founder of the faith.

1724
01:31:53.400 --> 01:31:58.170
What is callings were and how every Islamically run country at.

1725
01:31:58.200 --> 01:32:01.120
It's not the same thing.
It's not the same as any other religion.

1726
01:32:01.121 --> 01:32:03.280
And that's what I was pointing to.
You can find hypocrites,

1727
01:32:03.460 --> 01:32:06.340
you can find crazy Scientologists.
You can find crazy Christians,

1728
01:32:06.341 --> 01:32:09.100
but don't look to Christians,
look to Christ.
And you may not like Christ.

1729
01:32:09.101 --> 01:32:10.030
You may think he's weird.

1730
01:32:10.180 --> 01:32:13.660
Don't look to Muslims because you have Muslim refugees now going into Germany,

1731
01:32:13.661 --> 01:32:17.590
Syrian refugees who want welfare dollars per cigarettes.
That's not Muslim.

1732
01:32:17.770 --> 01:32:20.230
Look to Mohammed.
Mohammed did kill Mohammed,

1733
01:32:20.231 --> 01:32:23.500
did call for the deaths of Christians and Jews.
Muhammad did screw with six,

1734
01:32:23.501 --> 01:32:26.050
maybe nine year old girl.
He beat her but only lightly.

1735
01:32:26.051 --> 01:32:28.420
So you couldn't see bruises if she was dressed up as a Ninja.

1736
01:32:28.421 --> 01:32:29.320
That's not hard to do.

1737
01:32:29.500 --> 01:32:32.200
These are different things and people need to acknowledge it.

1738
01:32:32.201 --> 01:32:36.130
And the left that labels me a racist that labels you right wing because you have

1739
01:32:36.131 --> 01:32:39.220
a different opinion and you go off the reservation all of a sudden just

1740
01:32:39.221 --> 01:32:43.660
completely ignores that and sort of accepts it as as cultural relativity.
Well,

1741
01:32:43.661 --> 01:32:46.930
you don't really understand the reason a woman needs four witnesses when she's

1742
01:32:46.931 --> 01:32:48.940
had the the crap rape dot of our.

1743
01:32:48.941 --> 01:32:53.060
We're going to ignore that and talk about some people here who are pro life

1744
01:32:53.061 --> 01:32:56.410
cause their hands are on your uterus and that's what bothers me.
Well,

1745
01:32:56.411 --> 01:32:59.860
I get bothered by any ideology that's rigid.

1746
01:33:00.040 --> 01:33:02.620
Anytime you have to subscribe to a bunch of rules,

1747
01:33:02.621 --> 01:33:05.890
you have to fast during a certain time of the year,

1748
01:33:05.891 --> 01:33:09.040
you have to wear a certain outfit.
The women can't drive.

1749
01:33:09.041 --> 01:33:10.900
They're not allowed to go to school like any,

1750
01:33:11.020 --> 01:33:15.400
anytime you have really rigid ideologies and then those ideologies,

1751
01:33:15.401 --> 01:33:18.580
you find out that they're ancient and they're established by a warlord.

1752
01:33:18.940 --> 01:33:22.450
I mean that's,
that's,
that is what Christianity,

1753
01:33:22.480 --> 01:33:24.970
that's the difference between Christianity and Islam.
Yeah.

1754
01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:28.900
Like Jesus was supposed to be a man of peace and Muhammad was supposed to be a

1755
01:33:28.901 --> 01:33:33.070
warlord.
That's,
well,
he helped fund office.
He wage wars,
he beheaded people.

1756
01:33:33.071 --> 01:33:36.940
He did all those things.
It's a fundamental difference in the ideology and it's,

1757
01:33:36.941 --> 01:33:37.390
it's,

1758
01:33:37.390 --> 01:33:41.650
it shows itself in the behavior of the people that are a part of the ideology in

1759
01:33:41.651 --> 01:33:43.690
their minds.
This is all,

1760
01:33:44.260 --> 01:33:48.790
it's all like guaranteed in the scripture.
It's all in there and their eyes,

1761
01:33:48.791 --> 01:33:53.650
what they're doing is all hollow,
all everything is,
you know.
Yeah.
Hello.
It's,

1762
01:33:53.651 --> 01:33:54.630
you know,
it's one of those things,
it's,

1763
01:33:54.631 --> 01:33:57.940
it's also a political ideology and legal prescription.

1764
01:33:57.941 --> 01:33:58.721
That's what people don't understand.

1765
01:33:58.721 --> 01:34:01.840
And they go after Ben Carson and say he's a bigot.
So He's black,
right?

1766
01:34:01.841 --> 01:34:04.540
All conservatives were racist.
And then when Clinton announced her nomination,

1767
01:34:04.541 --> 01:34:08.020
all conservatives became sexist.
So with Ben Carson,
he's not really racing.

1768
01:34:08.030 --> 01:34:11.110
What we'll see is a bigot because he said he thought that he would have a

1769
01:34:11.111 --> 01:34:11.650
problem with him.

1770
01:34:11.650 --> 01:34:15.970
Muslim president who supported the actual ideals of law in the Quran,
Sharia law.

1771
01:34:16.390 --> 01:34:19.240
And they ask him,
said,
well,
what parts,
what parts do you have a problem with?

1772
01:34:19.270 --> 01:34:21.910
And you know,
Ben Carson,
he goes,
it's not unreasonable at all.
It goes,
well,

1773
01:34:21.911 --> 01:34:25.630
you know,
I think that there are parts that are impossible to rectify with the

1774
01:34:25.631 --> 01:34:28.660
constitution.
Like,
uh,
uh,
you know,
the treatment of women,

1775
01:34:28.661 --> 01:34:31.130
the requirement of witnesses for a female rape,

1776
01:34:31.131 --> 01:34:35.050
the subjugation of all non Muslims,
the dimitude in the poll taxes,

1777
01:34:35.051 --> 01:34:37.240
which of course couldn't be allowed in the United States.

1778
01:34:37.241 --> 01:34:40.720
So I believe that we'd have to have a Muslim reject those precepts if they were

1779
01:34:40.721 --> 01:34:44.650
going to be,
oh my God,
he's an EMT.
Wasn't like that's a reasonable position.

1780
01:34:44.651 --> 01:34:45.760
It's a very reasonable position.

1781
01:34:45.761 --> 01:34:49.630
And that thing was a reasonable thing about the Nazis.
Entirely reasonable.

1782
01:34:50.410 --> 01:34:55.400
The term Islamophobia two is a very disingenuous term.
Like I,

1783
01:34:55.450 --> 01:34:59.780
that that term drives me nuts.
If you criticize Islam,
you're Islamophobia.

1784
01:35:00.140 --> 01:35:03.920
What does a phobia phobia is a fear.
You fear of irrational religions.
Yes.

1785
01:35:03.921 --> 01:35:07.700
I have a fear of those.
Well,
I'm also afraid of the moonies I'm afraid of,

1786
01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:10.070
I'm afraid of a lot of cults.
Yeah.
You know why?

1787
01:35:10.071 --> 01:35:12.560
Because I don't think anybody should be able to tell you how the fuck you should

1788
01:35:12.561 --> 01:35:14.000
think.
I think the,

1789
01:35:14.030 --> 01:35:18.380
the idea of having a government and having laws that are established by the

1790
01:35:18.381 --> 01:35:20.420
people,
for the people that make sense,

1791
01:35:20.421 --> 01:35:24.440
that give people equal freedom to give people equal say freedom of speech,

1792
01:35:24.441 --> 01:35:26.810
freedom of religion,
freedom to practice,
whatever you feel,

1793
01:35:26.811 --> 01:35:29.570
as long as it doesn't infringe upon the rights of other people.

1794
01:35:29.571 --> 01:35:30.890
I think all those things are great.

1795
01:35:31.250 --> 01:35:35.690
I think as soon as you have any sorts of ideologies that infringe upon those

1796
01:35:35.691 --> 01:35:40.430
things and the fact that progressive people,
which is really weird,

1797
01:35:40.490 --> 01:35:43.370
they'll shit on Christians all day long and have no problem with it,

1798
01:35:43.580 --> 01:35:47.990
but they leave it Islam alone and the reason why they leave Islam alone,

1799
01:35:48.020 --> 01:35:51.620
it's cause they don't want to get killed.
That's the reality as Lama phobic.

1800
01:35:51.650 --> 01:35:56.150
Exactly.
Well that's the real is not criticizing it.

1801
01:35:56.300 --> 01:36:00.710
Criticizing it is not as Lama phobia.
It's like it's just a legitimate criticism.

1802
01:36:00.711 --> 01:36:04.820
It's a ridiculous idea.
They're all ridiculous.
I think anytime you,
you've,

1803
01:36:04.850 --> 01:36:09.850
you buy into some rigid shit that was created way before people understood the

1804
01:36:10.131 --> 01:36:14.000
world the way before people understood science way before people understood the

1805
01:36:14.001 --> 01:36:17.390
distance between the earth and the sun,
the moon,
the rotation of the earth.

1806
01:36:17.420 --> 01:36:17.810
I mean,

1807
01:36:17.810 --> 01:36:20.810
think about all the shit that happened to Galileo when he tried to say that the

1808
01:36:20.811 --> 01:36:23.690
earth wasn't the center of the universe.
Right?
I mean that's all religion,

1809
01:36:24.260 --> 01:36:27.440
the inquisition,
it's all religion.
There's so many things that had been done,

1810
01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:30.770
horrible things in the name of the ideology.

1811
01:36:31.040 --> 01:36:32.810
One of the things just as much in the name of atheism,

1812
01:36:32.811 --> 01:36:37.790
of course Michael Shermer had a interesting piece on the differences between

1813
01:36:38.030 --> 01:36:43.030
Islam and other religions and it was all essentially say he was saying that it

1814
01:36:43.581 --> 01:36:46.460
was the one religion that didn't go through the enlightenment.

1815
01:36:46.860 --> 01:36:49.700
It all these other religions,
all these other religions,

1816
01:36:49.701 --> 01:36:53.660
they sort of morphed and adapted to the new information.
You know,

1817
01:36:53.661 --> 01:36:57.170
obviously some less than others and obviously some,
I mean,

1818
01:36:57.171 --> 01:37:00.320
when you see the fucking pope dressed up like a wizard and you got to go,

1819
01:37:00.321 --> 01:37:03.760
well obviously he's got some of that old crazy shit in his,
in his,

1820
01:37:04.130 --> 01:37:08.910
in his fucking war chest,
but he's,
he's this pope.
Is Bernie Sanders in a funny,

1821
01:37:09.080 --> 01:37:13.910
he is right?
He's an interesting one.
I think he's a,
I think he's a faker.

1822
01:37:14.300 --> 01:37:17.130
I think what they did is they found some guy and they go,
look,
this is,

1823
01:37:17.350 --> 01:37:19.010
we're going to keep this thing rolling,
right?
Yeah.

1824
01:37:19.011 --> 01:37:21.950
We'd like to have the gay bath house right above the Vatican,
you know?

1825
01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:25.700
I mean date they owned the largest gay bathhouse in Europe.
You know that,
right.

1826
01:37:25.790 --> 01:37:30.410
Do you know the whole story behind it?
Let's talk about Islam.
Why Not Catholic?

1827
01:37:30.450 --> 01:37:33.920
I will.
I am.
Well,
I was raised,
well,
that's also very different.
You know,

1828
01:37:34.130 --> 01:37:37.100
and one thing that,
you're right,
I just don't want to create a moral equivalency.

1829
01:37:37.101 --> 01:37:40.550
I think we can agree that pragmatically,
even if they have a gay bath house,

1830
01:37:40.850 --> 01:37:43.220
it's not the same as hundreds of millions of people who want you and I blown up.

1831
01:37:43.250 --> 01:37:48.020
No,
it's not.
I mean that's a difference in Catholicism.
Like first of all,
they,

1832
01:37:48.021 --> 01:37:52.130
you know,
there's,
there's no proselytizing.
They're trying to convert people.

1833
01:37:52.370 --> 01:37:54.770
They do obviously shield child molesters.

1834
01:37:54.771 --> 01:37:56.600
I mean that was one of the reasons why the,

1835
01:37:56.610 --> 01:37:59.100
the last pope had to step down and that guy,

1836
01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:02.740
the reason why the Vatican has so much,
that's why writing or I had to step down.

1837
01:38:02.790 --> 01:38:06.060
Oh yeah.
Do you know he's wanted for crimes against humanity.

1838
01:38:06.061 --> 01:38:07.920
They want to prosecute him for crimes against humanity.

1839
01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:10.050
That guy shielded child molesters.

1840
01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:14.820
The point where one of the guys he shielded went on to molest a hundred plus

1841
01:38:15.210 --> 01:38:19.650
deaf children.
I mean they,
they fucking sent him.
They would take that even here.

1842
01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:24.600
Oh it's cool.
How dare you.
How dare you,
how dare you sneak that one in.
Sorry.

1843
01:38:24.870 --> 01:38:29.280
But he was one of those guys and actively shielded people find a problem with

1844
01:38:29.281 --> 01:38:30.060
that.
And I've,
you know,

1845
01:38:30.060 --> 01:38:33.450
I think people toss religion under the same thing as people of faith.

1846
01:38:33.480 --> 01:38:35.480
And you know,
Islam doesn't really allow,

1847
01:38:35.580 --> 01:38:39.510
allow any sort of practice of faith or relationship when we want to call it

1848
01:38:39.540 --> 01:38:42.570
outside of their very specifically prescribed doctrine.

1849
01:38:42.820 --> 01:38:45.660
When you talk about [inaudible] specifically prescribed doctrines,

1850
01:38:45.661 --> 01:38:49.290
like how much of the Bible do you believe is real?
You know,

1851
01:38:50.140 --> 01:38:53.370
we want to get into each and every issue of the bylaw dudes coming back from the

1852
01:38:53.371 --> 01:38:56.760
dead and I can get into it here.
You know what I think,
here's what I think.

1853
01:38:56.761 --> 01:38:59.250
Here's what I think Joe and I,
to be fair and you might,

1854
01:38:59.251 --> 01:39:01.410
this might take a real turn where you might get angry,

1855
01:39:01.710 --> 01:39:05.670
but I hope you don't doubt it.
Um,
it's intellectual Poquito when you do that,

1856
01:39:05.730 --> 01:39:08.430
you need to have a Dinesh d'souza on or Lawrence Tisdale on,

1857
01:39:08.431 --> 01:39:11.610
cause you can say these things,
I'm not equipped for it.
I'm a blue belt.
I have,

1858
01:39:11.660 --> 01:39:14.790
I've,
I've looked at the swath of evidence and I've made up my mind.

1859
01:39:15.150 --> 01:39:17.100
But if you see this stuff is crazy,
this,
well,

1860
01:39:17.101 --> 01:39:19.400
I've made my decision and it's likely to change and I'm like that.

1861
01:39:19.430 --> 01:39:22.980
My faith has changed.
Has It?
Unless you fast.
Yeah.

1862
01:39:22.981 --> 01:39:24.630
I think certain parts of my face of changed,

1863
01:39:24.780 --> 01:39:28.050
but my point is until you have someone like that who's qualified to do it,

1864
01:39:28.051 --> 01:39:30.480
the same people who are going to be talking about,
sorry,

1865
01:39:30.481 --> 01:39:32.550
nine 11 being an inside job or whatever it is.

1866
01:39:32.550 --> 01:39:37.550
Someone who just as qualified to talk about nine 11 does compensation by

1867
01:39:37.790 --> 01:39:41.750
helicopters.
I'm saying until you have someone on like that fuel doesn't mail.
No.

1868
01:39:42.060 --> 01:39:42.871
Let me finish this point.

1869
01:39:42.871 --> 01:39:45.000
This is important because until you have someone on like that,

1870
01:39:45.330 --> 01:39:48.840
you're doing a monkey fist and Joe Rogan,
baby monkey,

1871
01:39:48.841 --> 01:39:51.770
I will do that and do that with my opponent hung food guy.

1872
01:39:51.810 --> 01:39:54.630
You're doing that intellectually because you're not having someone who would it

1873
01:39:54.631 --> 01:39:57.450
be able to argue those points,
but I'm not here to art in all fairness.

1874
01:39:57.451 --> 01:40:00.930
Guess what?
I can't argue those points either.
If you have someone like that,

1875
01:40:00.931 --> 01:40:04.420
I would have to bring on an actual religious scholar who's an atheist.
Yeah.

1876
01:40:04.440 --> 01:40:06.060
But I mean,
you know,
you obviously have your,
your,

1877
01:40:06.061 --> 01:40:10.260
you push it and you have every right to,
it's,
it's your promo.
You do as well.

1878
01:40:10.261 --> 01:40:13.980
If you go on and say that you're a Christian and I say,
well,
what do you believe?

1879
01:40:13.980 --> 01:40:17.860
Yeah.
I think just between two gentlemen.
That's a fair discussion.
Yeah.
But it's,

1880
01:40:17.890 --> 01:40:18.400
no,
there's,

1881
01:40:18.400 --> 01:40:21.570
there's no doubt that the way you approach it is certainly more aggressive than

1882
01:40:21.571 --> 01:40:25.250
someone who's an atheist than someone who is anything.

1883
01:40:25.850 --> 01:40:28.620
You give them more of a pass and someone who may be claims to be a Christian,

1884
01:40:28.621 --> 01:40:30.510
but that's not even the main focus on what I talk about.

1885
01:40:30.511 --> 01:40:33.330
You know what I'm saying?
Okay.
I got confused.

1886
01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:36.510
So you're saying I give atheist more of a path?
Yeah.
You give them more leeway.

1887
01:40:36.570 --> 01:40:40.560
Oh,
am I believe in anything,
but I do.
Sure they do.
What are they doing?

1888
01:40:40.561 --> 01:40:44.700
Millions and millions of people killed the name of atheism.
Stalin.
Mao.
Oh,
no,
no,

1889
01:40:44.701 --> 01:40:46.740
no.
It's not.
What I mean though,
that's not what I mean.

1890
01:40:46.741 --> 01:40:49.290
I'm saying how about they do believe in ideology.
A lot of them.

1891
01:40:49.680 --> 01:40:52.460
There is an atheist ideology,
the new atheists,
hey,

1892
01:40:52.470 --> 01:40:56.710
but the atheist ideology doesn't involve mysticism and magic,

1893
01:40:58.270 --> 01:41:02.650
right?
Some pitocin slut.
Like what does,
when you have people who do well,
let's,

1894
01:41:02.651 --> 01:41:03.700
let's use it this way,
right?

1895
01:41:03.940 --> 01:41:07.760
Let's say I don't understand the Bible in its entirety.
I'm not a theologian.
Um,

1896
01:41:07.990 --> 01:41:10.800
do you really think that people who are going to be right now going into schools

1897
01:41:10.810 --> 01:41:14.680
with dormers understand the intricate science of the Big Bang?
Well,

1898
01:41:14.681 --> 01:41:19.060
I don't think anybody understands that.
They
understand where it go.

1899
01:41:19.061 --> 01:41:23.680
So there's no mystery.
Sure.
Something happened.
There's no mechanism to that.
Well,

1900
01:41:23.681 --> 01:41:24.850
there's definitely,
I mean,

1901
01:41:24.851 --> 01:41:28.120
Terence Mckenna had this brilliant thing about science,
you know,

1902
01:41:28.150 --> 01:41:32.260
and he was saying that science wants one miracle.

1903
01:41:32.770 --> 01:41:34.180
They want one miracle.

1904
01:41:34.181 --> 01:41:38.650
You give us one miracle and then we'll allow everything else.

1905
01:41:39.100 --> 01:41:42.760
We'll figure out,
we'll,
we'll explain to you multi-celled organisms will explain,

1906
01:41:42.761 --> 01:41:45.430
explain to you carbon molecules.
What we want is one mirror.

1907
01:41:45.460 --> 01:41:47.530
How did we want it to come from down in life?
No,

1908
01:41:47.590 --> 01:41:51.220
the big bang itself is the one miracle.
Something come from nothing.
Well,

1909
01:41:51.221 --> 01:41:52.750
not just something come from nothing.

1910
01:41:52.770 --> 01:41:56.590
How does something smaller than the head of the pin explode and become the

1911
01:41:56.591 --> 01:41:57.520
entire universe?

1912
01:41:57.521 --> 01:42:02.290
How does something that has so much mass and is so fucking infinitely small,

1913
01:42:02.380 --> 01:42:05.170
why does it explode?
Like why does it explode right now?

1914
01:42:05.171 --> 01:42:09.940
Even saying that the big bang existed,
I've never heard someone adequately,

1915
01:42:10.030 --> 01:42:14.170
adequately explained,
maybe I'm wrong,
but adequately explain why it happened.

1916
01:42:14.200 --> 01:42:18.730
Right.
I don't think they know well,
yes,
and my point is,
does anybody know?

1917
01:42:19.030 --> 01:42:20.900
Does anybody say they?
No,
not that I know of.

1918
01:42:20.950 --> 01:42:23.620
I don't think they say they know what Ben Carson are up to about.

1919
01:42:24.550 --> 01:42:25.840
Like when he's a neurosurgeon,

1920
01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:30.130
the big bang is one of the ones that I think you got to go.

1921
01:42:30.131 --> 01:42:33.330
Well I think they think that this happened because they have,
you know,

1922
01:42:33.340 --> 01:42:37.000
radio frequencies that they can discover and they can,

1923
01:42:37.150 --> 01:42:41.110
they can monitor and measure and we know Dawkins explanation.
I mean,

1924
01:42:41.111 --> 01:42:42.250
how do you sit there?
No mysticism.

1925
01:42:42.251 --> 01:42:45.550
That may be maybe these cells came on the back of crystals.

1926
01:42:46.990 --> 01:42:49.630
What is it that,
what's that?
That's what he said in the movie with Ben Stein.

1927
01:42:49.631 --> 01:42:52.330
Well,
maybe we think that maybe some of these molecules came in,
you know,

1928
01:42:52.331 --> 01:42:56.620
on the backs of foreign crystals,
foreign crystal Crystal's came in the big bang.

1929
01:42:56.621 --> 01:42:58.390
How do we get this life?
I mean it was questioned on it.

1930
01:42:58.391 --> 01:43:00.490
I'm thinking that sounds mystical to me.

1931
01:43:00.491 --> 01:43:03.310
I think at a certain point something has taken on faith.
My point is this,

1932
01:43:03.580 --> 01:43:05.920
what we're arguing about Islam,
Christianity,
all others,

1933
01:43:05.950 --> 01:43:09.670
we're talking pragmatically,
what's the effect?
What's the geopolitical effect?

1934
01:43:09.671 --> 01:43:10.840
What are the ramifications?

1935
01:43:11.980 --> 01:43:15.120
I think it's really easy to simplify and you want people in the comment section

1936
01:43:15.130 --> 01:43:19.150
going with Zombie Jesus who you know didn't exist.
That's what I'm saying.
Yeah.

1937
01:43:19.151 --> 01:43:23.560
It's just as easy for someone to say so you have someone who's not you but you

1938
01:43:23.561 --> 01:43:24.730
and your,
you know,

1939
01:43:24.790 --> 01:43:29.790
a lounge chair with a box of cheezits who has no meaning whatsoever and truly

1940
01:43:34.090 --> 01:43:38.320
believes that a a bang happened and all of a sudden Joe Rogan's drinking is

1941
01:43:38.321 --> 01:43:39.370
fresh French press.

1942
01:43:39.370 --> 01:43:42.370
You can simplify anything and make it sound absurd and that's why I go back to,

1943
01:43:42.371 --> 01:43:46.660
I think they're smart people smarter than me on both sides and my mind is likely

1944
01:43:46.661 --> 01:43:49.660
to change.
Their mind is not likely to change in the second amendment.

1945
01:43:49.661 --> 01:43:51.770
My mind is not likely to change free speech.

1946
01:43:51.800 --> 01:43:56.060
It's not likely to change in the fact that uh oh Muhammad was a bastard.

1947
01:43:56.510 --> 01:43:59.270
Well,
I'm certainly with you on a lot of that,

1948
01:43:59.271 --> 01:44:03.110
but I think that what they're talking about when they're talking about mystical

1949
01:44:03.111 --> 01:44:06.650
occurrences during the time period of written history,

1950
01:44:06.860 --> 01:44:09.330
which is what they're talking about when you're talking about the,

1951
01:44:09.331 --> 01:44:12.340
the age of Jesus you're,
you're with,

1952
01:44:12.550 --> 01:44:17.540
these are like times where we do understand the parameters of actual possible

1953
01:44:18.980 --> 01:44:20.930
things that could have happened.
Sure.
You know,

1954
01:44:20.931 --> 01:44:22.370
like people coming back from the dead.

1955
01:44:22.371 --> 01:44:26.330
We have no evidence ever than anybody's ever been able to come back from the

1956
01:44:26.331 --> 01:44:29.490
dead means it doesn't.
It doesn't seem likely that that's true.

1957
01:44:29.491 --> 01:44:30.710
A whole different conversation.

1958
01:44:30.730 --> 01:44:35.210
But we also know that is there a possibility of a miracle which you require for

1959
01:44:35.211 --> 01:44:38.360
the big bang.
And I require for,
I don't necessarily on a train,

1960
01:44:38.420 --> 01:44:42.500
I require a miracle for the big bang.
I think there's missing science.

1961
01:44:42.560 --> 01:44:45.680
I think that there's look first and there's missing evidence from the,
you know,

1962
01:44:45.681 --> 01:44:48.470
a good example,
right?
This argument using right now,
okay,

1963
01:44:48.610 --> 01:44:50.260
I want to get it right because this is,
I'm not a theologian.

1964
01:44:50.270 --> 01:44:53.390
What is the hardest but argument?
But an argument was used for a long time.

1965
01:44:53.391 --> 01:44:54.560
It's kind of what you're,
there's no proof of that.

1966
01:44:54.561 --> 01:44:57.260
So for the longest time people said,
because David was as huge,

1967
01:44:57.261 --> 01:44:59.690
influential historical figure,
right?
And they're going,
well,
David,

1968
01:44:59.691 --> 01:45:02.810
up until 1993 they go,
and this is a guy,
this giant kingdom,
right?

1969
01:45:03.020 --> 01:45:03.771
This is the guy.

1970
01:45:03.771 --> 01:45:07.970
There should be some historical evidence and there's none until 1993 boom.

1971
01:45:07.971 --> 01:45:10.130
More evidence than you could possibly imagine on David.

1972
01:45:10.131 --> 01:45:13.910
His name on marble stone here is David,
is his kingdom as a historical figure.

1973
01:45:13.970 --> 01:45:14.541
Now,

1974
01:45:14.541 --> 01:45:18.050
nobody denies that he existed and nobody denies that the lineage of the kings

1975
01:45:18.051 --> 01:45:22.040
who were listed in the old testament existed when they claim to.
Now before that,

1976
01:45:22.070 --> 01:45:25.640
the big argument was there would be some kind of proof of of King David and

1977
01:45:25.641 --> 01:45:28.730
there isn't.
So the real issue is not evidence of absence.

1978
01:45:28.960 --> 01:45:31.700
The real issue with that argument is anytime you're dealing with things that are

1979
01:45:31.701 --> 01:45:36.090
2000 years old plus like good luck finding anything.
Yeah,
but we didn't know.

1980
01:45:36.410 --> 01:45:39.500
Yeah.
I mean we find some things but I'm saying like saying,
well I'm,

1981
01:45:39.501 --> 01:45:40.610
I'm arguing for you.

1982
01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:43.250
I'm saying like saying that something doesn't exist because we haven't found

1983
01:45:43.251 --> 01:45:47.750
evidence.
Like boy there's not a lot of evidence from 2000 years ago.
Right.

1984
01:45:47.751 --> 01:45:52.751
I mean that is a long fucking time and 2000 years of erosion and water and

1985
01:45:54.470 --> 01:45:57.590
natural disasters and all.
I mean everything gets lost.

1986
01:45:57.600 --> 01:45:58.580
We have a great bid on that.

1987
01:45:58.760 --> 01:46:01.850
And I actually had a bit similar that sucked and I asked it,
um,

1988
01:46:02.150 --> 01:46:04.280
cause you said it better if I send you into the forest,

1989
01:46:04.310 --> 01:46:05.690
how long before you send me an email?

1990
01:46:05.960 --> 01:46:09.110
If I send you into the woods with a hatchet,
how long you could send me any,

1991
01:46:09.111 --> 01:46:12.020
sorry,
I butchered it.
Simplifies it.
And I was like,

1992
01:46:12.260 --> 01:46:15.920
I had a bit about like going back to the witch trials and trying to explain to

1993
01:46:15.921 --> 01:46:18.500
them,
you know,
germ theory and a microscope and it just didn't work.

1994
01:46:18.530 --> 01:46:20.480
And I heard you do that.
And I'm like,
all right mom.
Just getting rid of that.

1995
01:46:20.480 --> 01:46:24.380
Well,
my bit was about dumb people.
Outbreeding smart people.
And by the way,

1996
01:46:24.381 --> 01:46:28.640
this came out before that.
What does that movie about retards?
Um,

1997
01:46:28.940 --> 01:46:33.650
can't say idiocracy idiocracy it came out the bit was on TV before idiocracy

1998
01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:36.360
okay,
so people use Gulu?
No.
Why The valley?

1999
01:46:36.361 --> 01:46:40.130
That is almost exactly like yours on vegans in milk.
Oh,
but I'm not,

2000
01:46:40.220 --> 01:46:44.720
I'm not asking it because I like it.
Let's keep going.
I'm on your salad.

2001
01:46:44.730 --> 01:46:46.720
I'll let you steal my shit.
It's already to Ncua.

2002
01:46:46.970 --> 01:46:49.890
There's evidence to be doing it back to oh eight.
That's go on.

2003
01:46:49.891 --> 01:46:50.724
I'm just doing it before that.

2004
01:46:50.730 --> 01:46:54.240
Were you doing the Vegan bit before eight milk camels?
Yeah,
it had to be formed.

2005
01:46:55.190 --> 01:46:59.160
It took a while.
Yeah.
Like 25 minutes.
Vegan bed,
put it on TV.

2006
01:46:59.161 --> 01:47:03.990
I think in 2013 14 it was in Colorado,
Rocky Mountain.
And that was,
uh,

2007
01:47:04.050 --> 01:47:08.280
but I,
I had ideas for that for a while.
The milk part was just one part of it.

2008
01:47:08.281 --> 01:47:13.140
The real part was about the remote shut the fuck up about being vegans.
But um,

2009
01:47:13.380 --> 01:47:16.590
the,
the thing about the,
um,
the idiocrasy thing,

2010
01:47:16.920 --> 01:47:18.540
the was about the pyramids.

2011
01:47:18.570 --> 01:47:23.400
It was about the dumb people outbreeding smart people and that like if one day,

2012
01:47:23.401 --> 01:47:27.780
like what would we do if one day no one fucked the smart people and we didn't

2013
01:47:27.781 --> 01:47:30.960
even realize that they died off.
And then one day the power just shuts off.

2014
01:47:30.990 --> 01:47:33.660
And what do you do when the power shut off?
I don't know what you do,

2015
01:47:33.661 --> 01:47:37.480
but I just sit around and wait because I figure,
well there's somebody.
Yeah,

2016
01:47:37.500 --> 01:47:39.900
but after a while,
like we'd be wandering through the streets,
like,

2017
01:47:39.901 --> 01:47:42.660
who's fucking turn the power?
But does anybody,
do you guys know nothing?

2018
01:47:42.661 --> 01:47:45.500
You hear anything?
Fuck you the best.
Mike goes down,
you're like,
well,
can't,

2019
01:47:45.501 --> 01:47:49.710
there's a wire here.
Yeah,
and it plugs in there and that's about the extent.

2020
01:47:49.720 --> 01:47:54.000
There's very few people because the compartmentalization of our society's very

2021
01:47:54.001 --> 01:47:56.640
few people,
if any,
that understand all of it.

2022
01:47:56.670 --> 01:48:00.630
That understanding the power grid that understand the purification of the water,

2023
01:48:00.631 --> 01:48:05.310
that understand the government,
that understand the computers,
technology,

2024
01:48:05.311 --> 01:48:09.230
the Internet.
There's very few people that could recreate all the things.
Yeah.

2025
01:48:09.390 --> 01:48:14.040
And most of us rely on a bunch of other people that are experts in order to keep

2026
01:48:14.041 --> 01:48:17.040
this insane machine we call technology going.

2027
01:48:17.310 --> 01:48:21.120
So my theory on the pyramids was that dumb people out,

2028
01:48:21.121 --> 01:48:25.830
fuck the smart people and left behind this whole thing and then the dumb people

2029
01:48:25.831 --> 01:48:28.260
would show up.
There was no one in the pyramid.

2030
01:48:28.380 --> 01:48:33.380
The Piccolo supposed to get out checks on Friday and there's nobody there and

2031
01:48:33.421 --> 01:48:37.990
then eventually no centricity down there that needs to be protested.

2032
01:48:38.210 --> 01:48:40.560
There was the thing,
the burning of the library of Alexandria,

2033
01:48:40.561 --> 01:48:43.530
I mean that really is kind of evidence of that.
That's what really would happen.

2034
01:48:43.560 --> 01:48:44.371
I mean then there is this,

2035
01:48:44.371 --> 01:48:49.200
the other thing that people like a lot of black people or African Americans want

2036
01:48:49.201 --> 01:48:50.280
to talk about,
um,

2037
01:48:50.310 --> 01:48:53.340
you know the pyramids and that the pyramids were built by black people,

2038
01:48:53.670 --> 01:48:54.300
but it's it,

2039
01:48:54.300 --> 01:48:58.320
they were built by Africans for sure because Egypt was Africa and it is in

2040
01:48:58.321 --> 01:49:02.970
Africa.
But the people from the south,
like there was,

2041
01:49:02.971 --> 01:49:07.971
there was black or Africans that came in and killed the Egyptians that were

2042
01:49:08.071 --> 01:49:08.371
there.

2043
01:49:08.371 --> 01:49:13.260
And that's why the Sphinx has an African face as an African looking face as

2044
01:49:13.261 --> 01:49:18.010
opposed to you've looked at African face nostrils clips.
Yeah.

2045
01:49:18.030 --> 01:49:19.860
Don't you love with Shaun King?
Yeah.

2046
01:49:20.310 --> 01:49:22.770
The pictures of him as a kid has strawberry blonde UCM.

2047
01:49:23.050 --> 01:49:27.420
I started on curves and every picture he takes,
he's flaring his nostrils.

2048
01:49:27.450 --> 01:49:30.420
He's reading in and like,
that is the most racist thing.
It's like,
hold on,

2049
01:49:30.421 --> 01:49:34.980
let me get a black too.
I picture of black.
I do that.
You kind of like gorilla,

2050
01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:37.220
like a really likes,
you know,
sniffle.

2051
01:49:37.230 --> 01:49:40.320
They tried to say black people who grew up in you,
son of a bitch.

2052
01:49:40.350 --> 01:49:41.820
I can't believe you.
Well,

2053
01:49:41.821 --> 01:49:45.240
that's what just happened with that Quentin Tarantino and you see that he,

2054
01:49:45.330 --> 01:49:49.110
he savage think pieces people wrote about me and they go,
you said sad,

2055
01:49:49.111 --> 01:49:51.310
the gs calling black people saboteurs and I was like,

2056
01:49:51.790 --> 01:49:54.490
that's the thing with these,
you know Tina was more leftist.

2057
01:49:54.491 --> 01:49:55.390
Same thing with Matt Damon.

2058
01:49:55.420 --> 01:49:59.410
I just love seeing these people are progressive and they like to separate from

2059
01:49:59.411 --> 01:50:02.920
themselves and the social justice warrior cult.
It's the monster.

2060
01:50:02.921 --> 01:50:06.310
They've created it.
They deserve to be.
Well,
Amy Schumer got attacked.

2061
01:50:06.370 --> 01:50:08.650
She got attacked for some of the bits that she did on her show.

2062
01:50:08.650 --> 01:50:10.770
She's up on stage pushing gun control with a,

2063
01:50:10.790 --> 01:50:13.080
with her third cousin twice removed.
I think she deserves,

2064
01:50:13.140 --> 01:50:17.260
well you do realize that she had a movie that came out and there was a mass

2065
01:50:17.261 --> 01:50:20.590
shooting in the movie theater where her movie was being played.

2066
01:50:20.591 --> 01:50:22.960
I mean that's got to fuck with your head.
Yeah,
yeah,
I'm sure.

2067
01:50:22.990 --> 01:50:25.450
Oh they were playing trainwreck while some guy opened fire.

2068
01:50:25.451 --> 01:50:28.540
Therefore I'm directly responsible and I'm going to remove your right to self

2069
01:50:28.541 --> 01:50:32.140
preservation.
I don't follow the logic trail.
Is she trying to remove your right?

2070
01:50:32.141 --> 01:50:33.700
I mean,
what is she trying to say?

2071
01:50:33.730 --> 01:50:37.000
I don't know what she's actually pushing legislation with chuck there in a,

2072
01:50:37.001 --> 01:50:40.450
in New York,
Chuck Schumer senator.
It's part of our,
oh,

2073
01:50:40.451 --> 01:50:44.380
that is one of her cousins like third removed just when she's up on stage

2074
01:50:44.381 --> 01:50:45.520
pushing that.
You know,

2075
01:50:45.521 --> 01:50:48.100
I talked about that when you have Sarah Silverman saying it's time for Comedians

2076
01:50:48.101 --> 01:50:51.100
to get with the times and when you have Harrison green mom coming on saying,

2077
01:50:51.101 --> 01:50:54.910
I'll support free speech but I won't support hate speech.
It's a very,
you know,

2078
01:50:54.911 --> 01:50:57.370
you have a lot of comedians who came out and said that,
um,

2079
01:50:57.730 --> 01:50:58.780
what Nicole Arbor said,

2080
01:50:58.781 --> 01:51:03.010
which is wildly offensive and fat shaming cola was the girl with the shaming

2081
01:51:03.011 --> 01:51:06.850
thing.
They see that youtube video I just thought wasn't well done.

2082
01:51:06.880 --> 01:51:09.340
And I thought when she went on the view,
first of all,

2083
01:51:09.341 --> 01:51:12.400
you're walking right into the lion's den,
a bunch of Chubby broads on that show,

2084
01:51:12.580 --> 01:51:15.460
you know?
Well,
they've got to Raymond Raven Simone now.
Well,

2085
01:51:15.490 --> 01:51:18.160
it was really hilarious is one of their arguments was,
you know,

2086
01:51:18.161 --> 01:51:20.200
a lot of people just get addicted to certain foods.

2087
01:51:20.201 --> 01:51:23.650
Like is I think that's what she's saying.
Well one of the things,

2088
01:51:23.690 --> 01:51:27.910
Michelle Collins comedian and their joy bay Har Comedian and uh,
and,

2089
01:51:28.020 --> 01:51:30.370
and they're giving her the rules on comedy.

2090
01:51:30.400 --> 01:51:34.290
Well she didn't do a good job defending herself cause she tried to do shtick.
No,

2091
01:51:34.300 --> 01:51:38.020
no,
no.
I'm not going to do Michelle Collins.

2092
01:51:38.021 --> 01:51:41.920
Enjoy Bay harsh should absolutely feel a shame for telling her like Joy Bay is

2093
01:51:41.921 --> 01:51:44.290
going,
you know,
but listen,
you're skinny blonde,
you know,
whatever.

2094
01:51:44.291 --> 01:51:46.930
I make my jumps because I'm fat.
I first joke about myself,

2095
01:51:46.931 --> 01:51:48.310
you have to be so really joined bay,

2096
01:51:48.311 --> 01:51:50.680
how you're a Christian conservative cause that's what you make fun of all the

2097
01:51:50.681 --> 01:51:53.380
time.
It's just stupid stupid idea.

2098
01:51:53.560 --> 01:51:55.990
Now they're prescribing rules of comedy wants,

2099
01:51:55.991 --> 01:51:59.740
they're offended and I won't go down that trail at all.

2100
01:51:59.741 --> 01:52:02.500
And I don't think Nicole Arbor,
it's funny,
but that's what they're gonna do.

2101
01:52:02.530 --> 01:52:04.690
They're gonna attack you and say,
I don't think you're funny.

2102
01:52:04.691 --> 01:52:06.310
Therefore you shouldn't say this.

2103
01:52:06.340 --> 01:52:09.070
I'm not going to say I couldn't agree more in that way.
Yeah.

2104
01:52:09.071 --> 01:52:12.520
And I think that what she did was kind of Clunky,
but you know,
she's not,

2105
01:52:12.521 --> 01:52:15.430
I don't think she's a real standout issues.
Is She?
Yeah.
From Canada.
She's not,

2106
01:52:15.460 --> 01:52:19.780
she's not fantastic,
but she says,
I don't think she's a real stand up.
Now listen.

2107
01:52:20.350 --> 01:52:23.290
You know what though?
I think about it though.
I really believe that the,

2108
01:52:23.470 --> 01:52:24.930
you're kind of in America,

2109
01:52:24.970 --> 01:52:28.540
Canada or North America do want to get it sort of.

2110
01:52:28.541 --> 01:52:32.020
So I guess all those Canadians there and the shows from which you took part,

2111
01:52:32.021 --> 01:52:36.280
they were idiots.
They weren't funny.
Listen,
very funny guys.
Not standups.
Yeah,

2112
01:52:36.281 --> 01:52:39.370
but they're still coming about that.
Hmm.
Well,
you know,
the comedian,

2113
01:52:39.371 --> 01:52:43.260
actually a French Canadian means actor too.
I asked if they were stand up.

2114
01:52:43.610 --> 01:52:47.030
Stand up.
Well,
she still is actually doing stand up now.
He d well,
let me see,

2115
01:52:47.031 --> 01:52:50.040
was for a while.
Last time I spoke to him,
he's uh,

2116
01:52:50.060 --> 01:52:54.440
started doing standup to pay the bills.
He's got a horrible,
horrible,

2117
01:52:54.441 --> 01:52:57.920
horrible divorce story.
Dave Foley,

2118
01:52:57.921 --> 01:53:00.890
if you go and Google the day Foley divorce store,

2119
01:53:00.891 --> 01:53:05.450
I believe it's online and a youtube clip that,
um,
um,
Brandon made,

2120
01:53:05.840 --> 01:53:10.570
it's fucking insane.
But my point is,
let's go back.
This is important.
Okay.

2121
01:53:10.790 --> 01:53:14.360
Michelle Collins.
[inaudible],
Sarah Silverman,
Amy Schumer,

2122
01:53:14.540 --> 01:53:19.450
that should just have your bs meter flinging out.

2123
01:53:19.490 --> 01:53:21.790
It should be gone firing so hot,
your,
your,
your,

2124
01:53:21.791 --> 01:53:25.600
your cap out goes fat shaming fat.
But when Sarah Silverman says it's,

2125
01:53:25.601 --> 01:53:29.500
it's not hard to get with the times when Amy Schumer pushes for gun control.

2126
01:53:29.501 --> 01:53:32.030
And is Sarah Silverman saying that about about gun control?

2127
01:53:32.270 --> 01:53:35.300
She was saying that I'm comedy when she was asked about and what is,

2128
01:53:35.301 --> 01:53:39.140
what is allowable and what's not.
She's like,
well,
you know,
I defend free speech.

2129
01:53:39.141 --> 01:53:41.890
But yeah,
it's not hard to get with the times.

2130
01:53:41.900 --> 01:53:44.570
Like I used to say gay and I don't think you should say that.

2131
01:53:44.571 --> 01:53:48.470
And she's basically saying that's gay now,
but it's not about that gay.

2132
01:53:49.070 --> 01:53:52.040
It's about either.
It's all okay.
Jim Norton makes a great art.

2133
01:53:52.070 --> 01:53:56.030
People don't acknowledge how intelligent he is.
Oh,
he's very intelligent.

2134
01:53:56.070 --> 01:53:59.260
I love Jimmy.
They're all okay or none of it.
So yeah.
Well,

2135
01:53:59.510 --> 01:54:02.690
I got a whole bit about this in my last special.

2136
01:54:02.691 --> 01:54:05.060
You probably saw it like the whole thing about the,

2137
01:54:05.061 --> 01:54:08.810
about not being able to joke about things.
Right.
You know what I'm saying?

2138
01:54:08.990 --> 01:54:13.250
When I say things on stage,
when I'm joking,
I do not mean them there.

2139
01:54:13.251 --> 01:54:15.440
Like I say,
a bunch of crazy shit.

2140
01:54:15.650 --> 01:54:18.750
And the reason I say that crazy shit is because it's funny.
Right?

2141
01:54:18.800 --> 01:54:20.570
And if it's not funny,
I wouldn't say it,

2142
01:54:20.690 --> 01:54:25.130
but there's some things that I say that are absolutely not true.

2143
01:54:25.360 --> 01:54:28.460
And I say them just because they're funny,
but there's some things that are true.

2144
01:54:28.580 --> 01:54:33.160
Yeah.
Like here's one.
My wife is tired of fucking me.
I go,
but she's still,
she,

2145
01:54:33.500 --> 01:54:38.330
it's true.
But she,
she doesn't,
she doesn't say no because if she had a raper,

2146
01:54:38.900 --> 01:54:41.450
so that's not true.
I joke around,
I go,
I wouldn't rape her.

2147
01:54:41.570 --> 01:54:44.690
The worst I do is hold her down the fucker butt cheeks.
That's not true either.

2148
01:54:44.691 --> 01:54:47.300
I wouldn't do that either.
And it's like this whole series of things,

2149
01:54:47.301 --> 01:54:50.420
it gets more and more preposterous.
I go,
I'm joking to get it.

2150
01:54:50.450 --> 01:54:52.610
You see how it's going on here?
I'm not raping anybody.

2151
01:54:52.760 --> 01:54:55.790
She's like one of my favorite people I wouldn't written then I'd say the rest of

2152
01:54:55.791 --> 01:54:59.000
it,
but it's like the,
the idea is,
do you know,
scan down.

2153
01:54:59.010 --> 01:55:03.830
It is not stand up is not truth.
It is sometimes truth.

2154
01:55:03.850 --> 01:55:07.470
Right.
But it is what is funny [inaudible] you know,

2155
01:55:07.550 --> 01:55:11.030
I'm fucking around right now.
You can't anymore.
And,
and here's the thing,

2156
01:55:11.240 --> 01:55:15.020
the progressive left,
sorry.
Like Silvermans the Schumers,

2157
01:55:15.080 --> 01:55:15.980
the Harrison green bombs,

2158
01:55:16.100 --> 01:55:19.440
the joy [inaudible] am I saying sorry and then doing that.
Sorry.

2159
01:55:19.460 --> 01:55:21.500
These names because I know they're standing,
you're probably your friends.

2160
01:55:21.650 --> 01:55:25.810
But when they,
Amy is my friend and Sarah is my friend.
I really enjoyed there.

2161
01:55:25.910 --> 01:55:27.740
I mean that was a kid when they were doing standup,
you know,

2162
01:55:28.070 --> 01:55:30.590
I think Sarah is one of the best comics on the planet.
I really do.

2163
01:55:30.591 --> 01:55:34.530
But she was a shock comic.
Of course.
That was a big part of her ass still.

2164
01:55:34.550 --> 01:55:37.040
She's saying it's not hard to get with the time.
So really what she's saying is,

2165
01:55:37.041 --> 01:55:41.660
you can joke about this but don't joke about this and it's sort of like the

2166
01:55:41.661 --> 01:55:44.220
wealthy 1% protecting their wealth.

2167
01:55:44.340 --> 01:55:46.200
A lot of these established comedians now said,
well,

2168
01:55:46.201 --> 01:55:49.590
what applies to you didn't apply to me.
And that's something,

2169
01:55:49.591 --> 01:55:52.950
a lot of these kids now you're going to see it migrate the people who are the

2170
01:55:52.951 --> 01:55:56.670
real free speech warriors,
like the SAR guns have a cat like the Karen Strawns.

2171
01:55:56.670 --> 01:55:57.840
Maybe they're not all comedians,

2172
01:55:57.841 --> 01:56:01.590
but they're going to be online because stand up is not the environment that you

2173
01:56:01.591 --> 01:56:04.290
came up in.
You may be able to say what you want to say,
but let me,

2174
01:56:04.291 --> 01:56:05.570
let me paint a picture for you.
Okay?

2175
01:56:05.600 --> 01:56:08.540
Cause you're super wealthy and successful and I'm not worthy.
Um,

2176
01:56:08.640 --> 01:56:12.390
but I'm talking about the kid who's coming up and I don't know,
Omaha,

2177
01:56:12.391 --> 01:56:15.240
Nebraska or maybe even here at the laugh factory open mic night,

2178
01:56:15.360 --> 01:56:18.630
who you just do the laugh factory open Mike night,
make you stay in line.

2179
01:56:18.660 --> 01:56:21.600
I can't imagine day.
And then you come back a week later.
It's bullshit.

2180
01:56:21.750 --> 01:56:24.690
The point is that could gets up and makes a tranny Joe.
Right,
right.

2181
01:56:24.930 --> 01:56:26.880
Someone complains and threatened with a lawsuit.

2182
01:56:27.270 --> 01:56:29.910
Maybe the booker isn't a social justice warrior,

2183
01:56:29.911 --> 01:56:31.020
but you think he's going to say something.
You know what?

2184
01:56:31.021 --> 01:56:32.880
Let's just book another comment.
I'm not going to take that risk.

2185
01:56:32.910 --> 01:56:37.050
That's what happens and for me to see comedians supporting it,

2186
01:56:37.380 --> 01:56:41.370
I think you're seeing this sort of a passing of the guard with stand up to a lot

2187
01:56:41.371 --> 01:56:44.800
of these truth tellers online because they're not beholden to those rules.
Right.

2188
01:56:44.900 --> 01:56:45.900
I see what you're saying.

2189
01:56:45.901 --> 01:56:49.590
I don't know what Sarah meant when she said that and I don't know what context

2190
01:56:49.591 --> 01:56:52.950
she said it in,
but when you say that she's a shot comic,

2191
01:56:52.951 --> 01:56:57.360
most of our shocking stuff was kind of self deprecating.
Like most of her shock.

2192
01:56:57.390 --> 01:57:01.230
I mean she wasn't attacking people.
Well,
Jesus has magic was a,
if you look at it,

2193
01:57:01.231 --> 01:57:04.230
there was a lot of stuff that was designed to prod Christians,
which is fine.

2194
01:57:04.231 --> 01:57:08.490
It's funny,
but Christians don't try and kill you rise.

2195
01:57:08.580 --> 01:57:09.391
I see what you're saying.
Well,

2196
01:57:09.391 --> 01:57:12.510
I haven't seen her do that with this long called Shiny happy Jihad.
I saw that.

2197
01:57:13.600 --> 01:57:18.090
Yeah it was,
it was good.
Was it was a little risky.
It was a little risky.

2198
01:57:18.091 --> 01:57:19.680
But again,
you do like what you did,

2199
01:57:19.710 --> 01:57:23.310
what you did [inaudible] that was way more risky.
Thank you Joe.
Yeah,

2200
01:57:23.311 --> 01:57:27.990
mine was just jokes about like suicide bombers,
Joe mine jokes were like,

2201
01:57:27.991 --> 01:57:28.700
you know,

2202
01:57:28.700 --> 01:57:33.260
like that I don't understand suicide bombing cause I was raised Catholic like in

2203
01:57:33.300 --> 01:57:35.720
no Catholics believe in it that much.
Right?

2204
01:57:35.790 --> 01:57:38.370
Like there's never going to be a Catholic suicide bomber cause we just don't

2205
01:57:38.371 --> 01:57:41.610
believe in it that much.
I'm an incredibly critical of Catholicism.
You know,

2206
01:57:41.611 --> 01:57:42.450
being raised in Quebec,

2207
01:57:42.480 --> 01:57:45.780
people don't understand that in the United States at first of all the rights

2208
01:57:45.781 --> 01:57:46.650
you're talking about.

2209
01:57:46.651 --> 01:57:48.360
Ironically when you're saying you don't want origined religion,

2210
01:57:48.361 --> 01:57:50.550
those rights come from people who said they came from God.

2211
01:57:50.551 --> 01:57:53.040
It doesn't come from man,
it doesn't come from wall.
So that is a part of our,

2212
01:57:53.060 --> 01:57:56.490
our laws here.
Well it also came from people that didn't have the Internet.

2213
01:57:56.491 --> 01:57:59.850
They were writing things down where they come from.
That was very unique.

2214
01:57:59.851 --> 01:58:03.060
This was the first society that said,
okay,
these rights don't come from us.

2215
01:58:03.061 --> 01:58:07.020
They come from God.
That was why freedom of speech exists right here.

2216
01:58:07.050 --> 01:58:09.720
But it's also the first society established itself.

2217
01:58:09.721 --> 01:58:13.440
The difference between Church and state.
Yes,
no,
exactly.
And if you read the,

2218
01:58:13.441 --> 01:58:16.830
you know,
like for example,
the separation of church and state,
it doesn't exist.

2219
01:58:17.160 --> 01:58:18.210
It's not in the constitution.

2220
01:58:18.630 --> 01:58:21.750
It's written from a taken from a private letter from Thomas Jefferson to the

2221
01:58:21.751 --> 01:58:24.750
Danbury baptists where he was talking about no establishment of a state

2222
01:58:24.751 --> 01:58:28.340
denomination because they were afraid of a certain denomination taking over fast

2223
01:58:28.470 --> 01:58:31.350
forward Quebec where I was raised,
I went to public school,

2224
01:58:31.800 --> 01:58:36.630
I went to Catholic school.
Catholicism is the provincial denomination in Quebec.

2225
01:58:36.660 --> 01:58:38.550
The United States didn't want that.

2226
01:58:38.551 --> 01:58:41.650
And a big portion of it is if you look in Europe and you look in in Canada where

2227
01:58:41.651 --> 01:58:44.900
Catholicism was so overbearing and you have these beautiful cathedrals in

2228
01:58:44.901 --> 01:58:46.420
Montreal that are entirely empty,

2229
01:58:46.930 --> 01:58:50.860
people reject the oppressive thumb of religion.

2230
01:58:50.890 --> 01:58:53.680
And that's why more Christians exist in the United States,

2231
01:58:53.681 --> 01:58:55.330
not because they're stupid and they're bumpkins,

2232
01:58:55.570 --> 01:58:57.490
but because they didn't have the oppressive religion,

2233
01:58:57.491 --> 01:59:02.320
so they didn't reject it as readily.
So,
um,
that makes sense.
Yeah.
So your,

2234
01:59:02.321 --> 01:59:07.060
um,
public school was a religious school?
Yeah,
it was and I was not a Catholic.

2235
01:59:07.061 --> 01:59:10.180
I got sent home quite a few times for argument.
The teachers,

2236
01:59:10.420 --> 01:59:13.380
what did you argue about?
Um,
well I,

2237
01:59:13.381 --> 01:59:16.480
I bitched when I wasn't allowed to take communion because I had taken commune

2238
01:59:16.481 --> 01:59:18.310
with my parents for a long time and my dad was like,

2239
01:59:18.311 --> 01:59:20.320
do you understand what this says?
Yeah,
I understand that.
Okay,
explain it to me.

2240
01:59:20.350 --> 01:59:21.880
Okay,
fine.
You can take the bread from the basket.

2241
01:59:21.881 --> 01:59:26.380
But in Catholic church you can't do it.
It's a whole ceremony.
And a couldn't you?

2242
01:59:26.600 --> 01:59:28.600
Because I wasn't Catholic because he didn't officially taking it.

2243
01:59:28.680 --> 01:59:32.560
The Catholic Catholicism,
you didn't go through catechism all that.

2244
01:59:32.800 --> 01:59:33.910
And then I also had one,

2245
01:59:33.970 --> 01:59:37.490
and this will sound really silly to the atheist audience who aren't Christian,

2246
01:59:37.491 --> 01:59:40.090
so I'll get off it.
But they were teaching,
was taught about what's a saint kids.

2247
01:59:40.091 --> 01:59:43.300
And my school was Saint Francis of Assisi and my parents were always really

2248
01:59:43.301 --> 01:59:45.580
clear.
Like I had a dad who gave me the sex talk when I was three.

2249
01:59:45.820 --> 01:59:48.960
He gave me sort of three,
three,
damn,
I got sick,

2250
01:59:49.030 --> 01:59:51.230
I got a call at home and a preschool.
This is a,

2251
01:59:54.340 --> 01:59:58.410
my dad sounds like a home alone.
It's like,
no,
that's like dom.

2252
01:59:58.420 --> 01:59:59.980
I rare his joke.
Yeah.

2253
02:00:00.490 --> 02:00:03.120
Well he didn't want me to learn about it in school and think it was dirty.
Oh,

2254
02:00:03.130 --> 02:00:06.490
okay.
I got it really young and I actually,
even preschool Catholic school,

2255
02:00:06.491 --> 02:00:07.570
they were talking about what's a,

2256
02:00:07.640 --> 02:00:12.040
her name was Miss Mary and her daughter was in my class,
Monica.

2257
02:00:12.400 --> 02:00:15.910
And so she was giving us the whole like stork business and this is in preschool,

2258
02:00:15.911 --> 02:00:18.850
like I'm four or five.
And I go,
no,
that's not,
let me break it down for you.

2259
02:00:18.851 --> 02:00:23.800
That's how it works.
But the pro and then her,
um,
her daughter was in class.

2260
02:00:24.190 --> 02:00:25.600
So whatever lie,
she tells it home,

2261
02:00:25.601 --> 02:00:28.380
she has to keep alive for the class because their daughters,
their daughters,

2262
02:00:28.410 --> 02:00:29.620
like there's nothing,
there's no egg.

2263
02:00:29.621 --> 02:00:32.740
It's a tin can and a tummy and ended baby growth in a tin can.

2264
02:00:33.040 --> 02:00:35.950
And at this point I'm going like when my dad told me a penis,
vagina,
egg,

2265
02:00:35.951 --> 02:00:40.210
cell fertilization,
you know,
but how old were you?
I would have been four.
So four.

2266
02:00:40.211 --> 02:00:41.530
She's talking about tin cans,

2267
02:00:41.531 --> 02:00:44.530
but talking about 10 cans and I go up to the teacher,
I'm like,
well you're,

2268
02:00:44.590 --> 02:00:47.020
you know Monica is saying it's a tin can tell her nigga she was Steven.

2269
02:00:47.021 --> 02:00:49.810
It's a 10 camp,
like a p cat.
Oh,
what a bitch.

2270
02:00:49.840 --> 02:00:53.770
And I go home line or your kid lying to me.
I go home.
I remember asking my Dad,

2271
02:00:53.771 --> 02:00:55.570
I go,
dad is there like a king and a woman's stomach?

2272
02:00:56.440 --> 02:00:59.500
And this is just what my dad is.
He never baby tacos.
He just goes,
no,

2273
02:00:59.501 --> 02:01:01.540
that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life.
I wouldn't lie to you.

2274
02:01:02.080 --> 02:01:05.830
And that was it.
Wow.
So I knew that stuff.
I want to,
you got in trouble for that?

2275
02:01:06.250 --> 02:01:08.590
Well yeah cause she had to keep the live for her daughter.

2276
02:01:08.620 --> 02:01:10.600
Like what kind of trouble they can call home.

2277
02:01:10.600 --> 02:01:14.800
Like he's Steven's being inappropriate.
Wow.
If that was my fucking kid,

2278
02:01:14.801 --> 02:01:19.690
if I went to school in this dumb cunt is trying to tell my kid is a tin can

2279
02:01:19.691 --> 02:01:24.010
grown inside some woman's uterus.
Jesus Christ.
Well,
my dad did.

2280
02:01:24.040 --> 02:01:25.960
My Dad went in and uh,
we had a teacher,

2281
02:01:26.020 --> 02:01:29.740
I'll say her name cause I can't send her Mrs Lake.
She kicked me out of class.

2282
02:01:30.100 --> 02:01:32.350
Mrs Lake.
You know why she kicked me out of class?
Why?

2283
02:01:32.920 --> 02:01:34.120
Because I said there were 50 states.

2284
02:01:34.150 --> 02:01:38.800
She argued there were 52 what were the other two?
Alaska and Hawaii.

2285
02:01:39.140 --> 02:01:41.600
But that's 48 and the lower 48

2286
02:01:44.020 --> 02:01:48.960
well didn't Obama fuck that up?
I'm gonna fuck that up.
57 [inaudible] 57 yeah.

2287
02:01:49.340 --> 02:01:51.500
I thought he said 52 as well.
I said 57

2288
02:01:53.110 --> 02:01:56.870
when he was running for president.
You might have a fucking tired.

2289
02:01:56.871 --> 02:01:59.330
That guy must've been when he was running.
Right?
Wasn't it?

2290
02:01:59.360 --> 02:02:01.490
Especially with that much.
He drinks.
Does he drink a lot?

2291
02:02:01.580 --> 02:02:04.040
But it was his annual physical that came back like,
ah,
you're mostly good.

2292
02:02:04.041 --> 02:02:08.240
Just stop drinking so much.
Really?
How do you know this?
What was released.
Yeah.

2293
02:02:08.241 --> 02:02:12.110
People telling me recently and George Bushes physical.
No,
you may not like them,

2294
02:02:12.111 --> 02:02:14.600
but you never saw him.
He was running marathons.
Uh,

2295
02:02:14.630 --> 02:02:17.630
his last year of his presidency bench to two oh five for five reps.

2296
02:02:18.020 --> 02:02:21.860
That's pretty good for an old dude.
That's not bad.
He's got that like chimpanzee.

2297
02:02:21.861 --> 02:02:25.130
Why Erie strength?
But that old Charles Bronson deal.
Yeah.

2298
02:02:25.160 --> 02:02:29.240
Well he does a lot of really shitty paintings too.
You ever see us push?

2299
02:02:29.670 --> 02:02:33.300
Never seen his artwork.
I haven't.
No.
Oh,
it's really horrendously bad.
Perfect.

2300
02:02:33.301 --> 02:02:36.230
Yeah,
that's right.
One to bring up Lena Dunham's Dad's painting.
Yeah.

2301
02:02:36.231 --> 02:02:39.110
Well I want to also bring up why I keep,
we keep bringing her up.

2302
02:02:39.320 --> 02:02:42.680
You had a really good video because she's just started bringing her up.

2303
02:02:42.710 --> 02:02:46.690
How dare you.
Yeah.
I don't know you Lena.

2304
02:02:46.730 --> 02:02:48.310
I'm sure you're a very nice person.
She's not.

2305
02:02:48.500 --> 02:02:52.160
The video was very interesting because you were,

2306
02:02:52.161 --> 02:02:54.350
you were talking about this,

2307
02:02:54.380 --> 02:02:58.670
this whole story where she had come up with this book and in the book she was

2308
02:02:58.671 --> 02:03:00.800
talking about a time that she was raped,

2309
02:03:01.160 --> 02:03:06.160
but you highlighted her actual words that like when she was with this guy,

2310
02:03:06.891 --> 02:03:09.980
she started talking dirty to him.
This is before they even had sex,

2311
02:03:10.340 --> 02:03:13.160
she started talking dirty and to asking him if she,

2312
02:03:13.240 --> 02:03:17.930
if he wanted to do this and he wanted to do that and then he did those things

2313
02:03:17.931 --> 02:03:20.480
and then her friends are saying,
oh my God,
you got raped.

2314
02:03:21.170 --> 02:03:25.580
Like what kind of a fucking world are we living in that?

2315
02:03:26.240 --> 02:03:31.240
People are talking about that and not highlighting the ambiguity of talking

2316
02:03:32.301 --> 02:03:36.830
dirty to somebody,
not highlighting the mixed signals and you went over that.

2317
02:03:36.860 --> 02:03:40.550
I thought very respectfully.
I thought you did it really and I failed.

2318
02:03:40.551 --> 02:03:42.560
It wasn't meant to be respectful at all.
You were on,

2319
02:03:42.620 --> 02:03:45.890
you were honest about it and you weren't insulting.
You didn't,
it wasn't sold.

2320
02:03:45.920 --> 02:03:50.750
I dressed up like Lena Dunham.
Yeah,
that's true.
That's it.
That's trans face now,

2321
02:03:50.930 --> 02:03:54.680
but if you dress up like me is that if you're a girl and you were a this fucking

2322
02:03:54.681 --> 02:03:57.100
shirt,
is that it?
Am I ain't going to be insulted.
I Dunno.

2323
02:03:57.290 --> 02:03:59.930
That's not insulting to me.
If you dress like me,

2324
02:03:59.931 --> 02:04:02.600
I've never invite get us all come in like you dead.

2325
02:04:02.660 --> 02:04:04.160
You would be a guy dressing like a guy.

2326
02:04:04.161 --> 02:04:06.350
But I'm saying if you were a girl and you dress like me,

2327
02:04:06.351 --> 02:04:09.980
would I be like that insulting bitch?
Like why would that be insulting?

2328
02:04:10.120 --> 02:04:13.130
I don't understand that,
but because I mocked her.
Well,

2329
02:04:13.160 --> 02:04:18.160
you mocked what she said and you also mocked it because it was being paraded

2330
02:04:18.201 --> 02:04:21.510
around as if it made sense and it's fucking confusing.
Well,

2331
02:04:21.511 --> 02:04:22.710
that's the whole promise.

2332
02:04:25.730 --> 02:04:30.500
Yeah.
Are you wearing a wig?
Yeah.
Beautiful beeper wig.

2333
02:04:30.501 --> 02:04:32.570
I was like,
I wouldn't really,
well now she's changed your hair so many times.

2334
02:04:32.571 --> 02:04:36.460
She has a little little Lord Fauntleroy rave or whatever it is.
Haircut.
I see.

2335
02:04:37.200 --> 02:04:40.530
Yeah.
I guess this is,
this is old.
Yeah.
It was pretty mocking.
No,
that's an old,

2336
02:04:40.560 --> 02:04:44.490
that's an old one.
That's one.
This is a parody one.
The other one,

2337
02:04:44.491 --> 02:04:48.150
you weren't dressed like that and I was worried you were dressed like my

2338
02:04:48.151 --> 02:04:52.590
standard Lena Dunham outfit.
My point is the media doesn't call her on it.
And so,

2339
02:04:52.591 --> 02:04:55.290
and this is where I talk about kind of,
we all have blind spots.
He did,

2340
02:04:55.380 --> 02:04:58.350
not only did they not talk,
they didn't call her on it.

2341
02:04:58.620 --> 02:05:03.620
They didn't make her explain how like this is a like expo.

2342
02:05:04.740 --> 02:05:09.420
If you could tell the story because a lot of people probably don't know what

2343
02:05:09.421 --> 02:05:12.930
we're even talking about.
Tell the story that is in her book.
Um,

2344
02:05:13.680 --> 02:05:15.520
so late it Dunham claimed she was raped in her book.

2345
02:05:15.521 --> 02:05:19.500
She claimed she was raped by a mustachioed Republican.
She code named and Barry,

2346
02:05:19.501 --> 02:05:21.300
she said it was a night where muscle relaxers,

2347
02:05:21.301 --> 02:05:24.270
Xanax and alcohol took them back to her place.

2348
02:05:24.300 --> 02:05:27.540
She was peeing in a parking lot and he stuck his fingers in her nether regions.

2349
02:05:27.840 --> 02:05:28.381
And uh,

2350
02:05:28.381 --> 02:05:32.130
then she got home and she wasn't sure how she felt about it and she went ahead

2351
02:05:32.131 --> 02:05:35.370
with it and talk dirty to them.
Then I think while they're finishing up,

2352
02:05:35.371 --> 02:05:38.130
she saw a condom in the house plant and realize he had taken off a condom.

2353
02:05:38.131 --> 02:05:40.320
And then the next morning her friends told her she had been raped.

2354
02:05:40.860 --> 02:05:43.590
So everyone runs with us and they hold around is this rape survivor.

2355
02:05:44.400 --> 02:05:45.233
And here's the thing,

2356
02:05:45.270 --> 02:05:47.640
it's not that hard to track down the guy she's talking about.

2357
02:05:48.060 --> 02:05:51.630
I'm not a journalist.
It took about three or four phone calls.
Um,

2358
02:05:51.660 --> 02:05:53.850
and I won't get an,
I really don't want to go to that cause the guy obviously,

2359
02:05:53.851 --> 02:05:54.021
you know,

2360
02:05:54.021 --> 02:05:57.330
it can destroy his life where he's accused of raping someone has wife and kids.

2361
02:05:57.780 --> 02:06:02.690
Um,
here's the thing too,
when you talk about in the Republican either,
right?
Um,

2362
02:06:02.830 --> 02:06:06.330
I again,
I don't wanna get into personal stuff.
Okay.
No need to,

2363
02:06:06.450 --> 02:06:08.490
cause I don't wanna destroy his life.
You know,

2364
02:06:08.520 --> 02:06:10.320
people say rape destroys your life.
It does.

2365
02:06:10.350 --> 02:06:14.010
But falsely accusing a guy of rape is incredibly destructive as well.

2366
02:06:14.520 --> 02:06:15.570
And they don't have any recourse.

2367
02:06:15.571 --> 02:06:19.350
The legal system is entirely designed to prosecute.
End of story.
And you know,

2368
02:06:19.470 --> 02:06:22.920
same thing.
If you want to get custody of your kids.
So no one called her on it.

2369
02:06:23.190 --> 02:06:23.910
And um,

2370
02:06:23.910 --> 02:06:27.480
that's what I did the video on that if this is a huge disservice to rape victims

2371
02:06:27.481 --> 02:06:29.100
to women who are actually raped,
you know,

2372
02:06:29.101 --> 02:06:32.340
Lena Dunham goes out and says one in four women are raped.
I will tell you this.

2373
02:06:33.270 --> 02:06:36.090
I don't believe that statistic and the general population,
it's far less,

2374
02:06:36.091 --> 02:06:39.660
but at like feminist film festivals,
I think four out of three women are raped.

2375
02:06:39.870 --> 02:06:43.170
Everyone,
their claims to have been raped.
And these you'd think,
you know,

2376
02:06:43.200 --> 02:06:47.070
the more attractive you are,
the chances of being raped would go up.
Right.

2377
02:06:47.071 --> 02:06:49.920
I'm not robbing family dollar,
I'm going to go for the jeweler.

2378
02:06:50.130 --> 02:06:54.210
But apparently there's this,
an epidemic of purple pitted,
fatty,

2379
02:06:54.211 --> 02:06:58.380
Androgynous,
ambiguous feminists just getting raped by roaming packs.

2380
02:06:58.381 --> 02:07:00.590
That's what they want us to believe.
Well,
what,
it depends on what,

2381
02:07:00.600 --> 02:07:04.680
how you define rape because regret this rape all pee,
all regretful.

2382
02:07:04.681 --> 02:07:09.540
P In v what they teach in College [inaudible] v Penis and Vagina.
Regretful,

2383
02:07:09.600 --> 02:07:13.900
penis and Vagina is rape.
Yeah.
That.
That one is a really weird one to me.
Um,

2384
02:07:13.901 --> 02:07:18.030
I talked to Thaddeus Russell on the podcast about Occidental College where they

2385
02:07:18.031 --> 02:07:23.031
had that case where these two kids got drunk and they had sex and the girl was

2386
02:07:23.221 --> 02:07:27.780
saying to her,
friends,
I'm about to get laid,
lol.
You know,
he coming over,

2387
02:07:27.781 --> 02:07:30.900
do you have condoms?
Texting this guy,
guy comes over,
they have sex.

2388
02:07:31.260 --> 02:07:35.020
Afterwards she decides,
someone decides that it,

2389
02:07:35.800 --> 02:07:38.410
it was raped because she was intoxicated.

2390
02:07:38.590 --> 02:07:41.530
Completely ignoring the fact that he was intoxicated as well.
Yeah.

2391
02:07:41.630 --> 02:07:46.450
They were both drunk kids that had sex.
And you know what,
man,
when I was young,

2392
02:07:46.480 --> 02:07:48.100
that's what it was.
It was drunk.

2393
02:07:48.101 --> 02:07:51.310
People had sex and nobody felt like they got raped because they were drunk.

2394
02:07:51.311 --> 02:07:55.330
My wife rips me on the regular.
People make mistakes,
you know?
I mean,

2395
02:07:55.370 --> 02:07:58.590
people I've had sex with,
people I go after it was over was like,
oh,

2396
02:07:58.591 --> 02:08:01.630
I probably shouldn't drink so much.
We've all,
we've all been there,

2397
02:08:02.620 --> 02:08:04.030
we've all been there before.

2398
02:08:04.031 --> 02:08:07.990
Everybody who drinks and is young and especially when you're young,

2399
02:08:07.991 --> 02:08:10.840
you don't really know how to drink well you don't.
Yeah.

2400
02:08:10.841 --> 02:08:14.560
You don't have a large database of things to pull back from.
Like,
okay,

2401
02:08:14.561 --> 02:08:16.300
I've been down this road before.

2402
02:08:16.360 --> 02:08:21.070
The third shot of Jack is where shit goes downhill.
Whole purple haired,

2403
02:08:21.100 --> 02:08:25.480
five by five feminists starts looking pretty good.
People make mistakes,
man.

2404
02:08:25.481 --> 02:08:29.680
And you can't say that it's a fucking crime because you both engaged in a

2405
02:08:29.681 --> 02:08:32.800
consensual activity,
but you don't like it after it was over.
So it doesn't,

2406
02:08:32.830 --> 02:08:35.110
it doesn't matter.
But my point was that kid,

2407
02:08:35.350 --> 02:08:39.430
the boy got kicked out of the college.
The girl stayed.
They were both,

2408
02:08:39.520 --> 02:08:44.230
exactly.
They both participated.
They both were agreeable.

2409
02:08:44.231 --> 02:08:48.640
They both,
they mean,
she asked him,
come over,
do you have condoms?
He said,

2410
02:08:48.641 --> 02:08:50.140
I'm on my way.
Right.
They got together,

2411
02:08:50.141 --> 02:08:54.670
they had sex and because there was alcohol involved,
the girl was raped,

2412
02:08:54.700 --> 02:08:56.380
which is insane.
Well,
mattress girl,

2413
02:08:56.710 --> 02:09:01.710
you fell like almost invariably these cases come up and they're just lies there.

2414
02:09:01.841 --> 02:09:04.880
Just follow the rolling stone story.
Yeah,
the rolling stone story.
Um,

2415
02:09:05.230 --> 02:09:07.210
but Lena Dunham is so bad cause then she's holding it.

2416
02:09:07.211 --> 02:09:11.200
She's holding herself out of this rape survivor and you know she's molested her

2417
02:09:11.201 --> 02:09:13.570
little sister and she's just a bad human being.
And you'll,

2418
02:09:13.571 --> 02:09:15.550
you can bring up her dad's paintings.
Carroll Dunham.

2419
02:09:15.760 --> 02:09:19.240
I mean there's some weird stuff,
Carol.
Yeah.
Carol,
can we bring that up?

2420
02:09:19.630 --> 02:09:21.400
Her Dad's named Carol.
Can we do this?

2421
02:09:21.840 --> 02:09:26.140
Does it or dudes named Carol Carol show Shelby Carroll.
Shelby.

2422
02:09:26.290 --> 02:09:29.830
That's all he drew.
Wait a minute.
What the fuck is that?

2423
02:09:29.890 --> 02:09:34.480
That's her dad's painting.
Oh my God.
Her Dad's got a painting of a woman.

2424
02:09:34.840 --> 02:09:37.840
Her ass a,
that's all he drew.
That was his thing.

2425
02:09:38.290 --> 02:09:41.560
Just a woman from behind asses and vaginas.

2426
02:09:41.620 --> 02:09:46.090
Angry vaginas and this weird cart.
Yeah,
they're like baboons asses.
Yeah.

2427
02:09:46.330 --> 02:09:49.320
Now you don't think some weird stuff went on in that household.
Oh,

2428
02:09:49.330 --> 02:09:53.230
and this is the girl.
I mean she,
what did she do to her sister?

2429
02:09:53.231 --> 02:09:55.570
There was something that she admitted that she didn't like.

2430
02:09:55.580 --> 02:09:56.740
She reached in with her fingers,

2431
02:09:56.741 --> 02:09:59.440
she said because her sister put pebbles in her vagina and she also said she

2432
02:09:59.441 --> 02:10:03.400
would like,
she acted like a Predator where she would try and lure her sister,

2433
02:10:03.401 --> 02:10:08.380
like pay her to kiss her and she masturbated in bed next to her little sister.

2434
02:10:09.640 --> 02:10:13.770
What the fuck are these drawings?
You weren't down.

2435
02:10:13.780 --> 02:10:17.410
This is a healthy balanced individual.
Come on like let's just add up.

2436
02:10:17.460 --> 02:10:19.900
You can't guarantee it,
but add up the pieces to the puzzle.

2437
02:10:19.901 --> 02:10:23.650
And she's the feminist.
Uh,
she,
she's the new Barbara Streisand,
right?

2438
02:10:23.651 --> 02:10:28.360
She's out there.
And my issue was the media didn't call on it front page Huffpo,

2439
02:10:28.480 --> 02:10:32.350
CNN,
MSNBC,
you,
Lena Dunham bravely comes out about being a rape survivor.

2440
02:10:32.620 --> 02:10:36.170
And when I see leftist go in the corporate media man and they're buying Lena

2441
02:10:36.170 --> 02:10:40.400
Dunham wholesale,
that's what bothers me.
But look at that one,
this petition,

2442
02:10:40.430 --> 02:10:44.990
discuss talking strange.
You just get,
you know,
have you ever seen Jack Kevorkian?

2443
02:10:44.991 --> 02:10:49.520
His drawings?
I saw it,
yeah.
Some of them,
yeah.
Like what the fuck?

2444
02:10:49.521 --> 02:10:53.540
This is kind of along those lines along those lines where it's like,
oh,
okay.

2445
02:10:53.690 --> 02:10:56.030
I mean,
I'm a big fan of artistic freedom.

2446
02:10:56.031 --> 02:10:57.410
You should be able to do whatever the fuck you want.

2447
02:10:57.411 --> 02:10:59.150
But can we not show this on Youtube?

2448
02:10:59.151 --> 02:11:02.550
Is that where you're not putting it up online?
Oh,
okay.

2449
02:11:02.630 --> 02:11:04.900
People are going to have to,
yeah,
I'm just looking at say they're over 18 well,

2450
02:11:04.960 --> 02:11:09.590
it seems to me like God damn it man.
This is really weird shit.

2451
02:11:09.620 --> 02:11:12.530
So she gives her something that's objectification to mean.

2452
02:11:12.531 --> 02:11:16.250
This isn't just a beautiful woman face the angry vagina.
That's what I'm saying.

2453
02:11:16.570 --> 02:11:20.300
Well,
they're all buttholes and angry vaginas and when you do get ahead on view,

2454
02:11:20.510 --> 02:11:23.780
Jamie,
click on the one above the head on view.
You don't see the face.

2455
02:11:24.080 --> 02:11:27.770
Look at that girl that like in the middle there on that.
Yeah,
right there.

2456
02:11:28.100 --> 02:11:32.780
Let me from the rain.
Exactly what the fuck is going on with her nipples.
She,

2457
02:11:32.781 --> 02:11:35.630
first of all,
she looks like she's dead and drowning.
Right?

2458
02:11:35.631 --> 02:11:39.050
Or She's drowned and now she's Pale and white.
That looks like a drowning victim.

2459
02:11:39.320 --> 02:11:43.820
Like her legs are underwater.
The claim.
It's pointing out the irony or the pay.

2460
02:11:43.821 --> 02:11:47.540
I don't know.
It's just so striking in patriarchy.
So that's what my point is.

2461
02:11:47.541 --> 02:11:49.940
She's emblematic of everything that's wrong with social justice,

2462
02:11:49.941 --> 02:11:52.010
Warrior culture and our show just sucks.

2463
02:11:52.210 --> 02:11:55.400
[inaudible] which shows that girls on Hbo,
I've never seen it.
Well,

2464
02:11:55.401 --> 02:11:58.160
you know it's the perfect example,
right?
You hear about it everywhere.
Everyone,

2465
02:11:58.161 --> 02:12:01.340
all these Emmy's,
they're lucky to get 600,000 viewers on girls.

2466
02:12:01.370 --> 02:12:02.360
The ratings are terrible,

2467
02:12:02.600 --> 02:12:05.750
but HBO wants to push it because they believe the messaging is important.

2468
02:12:05.810 --> 02:12:06.770
What's the messaging?

2469
02:12:07.160 --> 02:12:11.150
That's all the feminists leftest tolerance bs that Lena Dunham pushes.

2470
02:12:11.151 --> 02:12:14.150
They've decided Lena Dunham is important enough that they're going to prop her

2471
02:12:14.151 --> 02:12:17.870
up despite the fact that an episode of curb your enthusiasm or game of Thrones

2472
02:12:17.871 --> 02:12:20.120
can get 10 times the viewership.

2473
02:12:20.270 --> 02:12:23.270
But it's important for the rape survivor to have a show and it's not true.

2474
02:12:23.600 --> 02:12:25.250
Is that really why you think they do it?

2475
02:12:25.370 --> 02:12:27.410
You don't think that that's a for profit enterprise?

2476
02:12:27.411 --> 02:12:29.000
Why would they do it otherwise?
Well,
don't you think?

2477
02:12:29.001 --> 02:12:32.750
They think they do it because it like balances out there programming or makes

2478
02:12:32.751 --> 02:12:36.590
them seem more area dite balances it out from what?

2479
02:12:36.591 --> 02:12:38.030
Hbo Is always to the Left.

2480
02:12:38.060 --> 02:12:40.890
No one like thinks like game of Thrones isn't to the left.
Oh,

2481
02:12:41.330 --> 02:12:42.870
game of Thrones is inconsequential.

2482
02:12:42.880 --> 02:12:45.650
It's you know the kind of kids who will argue with fucking awesome.
First of all,

2483
02:12:45.651 --> 02:12:49.700
watch your tongue.
I am not a big fan.
How dare you.

2484
02:12:49.790 --> 02:12:53.420
I'm not a big fan of my friend Natasha is Yaro.
She calls it make 'em ups.

2485
02:12:53.750 --> 02:12:56.300
She doesn't like any fiction.
She's like,

2486
02:12:56.301 --> 02:12:59.000
I don't like make 'em ups because they just make shit up like,

2487
02:12:59.001 --> 02:13:01.430
oh all of a sudden she gave birth to dragons.

2488
02:13:01.700 --> 02:13:04.980
You can't just make stuff up like that,
but you can't.
And game of Thrones.
Yeah.

2489
02:13:05.130 --> 02:13:06.680
I don't know.
I just didn't,
I just couldn't get into it.

2490
02:13:06.720 --> 02:13:10.700
The walking dead is my show.
Okay,
here's my take on the walking dead.

2491
02:13:10.760 --> 02:13:13.870
The new one is fucking better.
I like the dead.

2492
02:13:13.970 --> 02:13:18.140
It's better with the daddy or shows played a terrorist until this a real well,

2493
02:13:18.290 --> 02:13:21.890
he's only ever been poor guy.
But you know what?
He broke out of it,
man.

2494
02:13:22.010 --> 02:13:24.500
He did good for him.
You know what broke through the brown seal.

2495
02:13:24.501 --> 02:13:26.860
This is an episode.
I don't want to bring it up,
but when he went,
Joe,

2496
02:13:26.960 --> 02:13:30.950
I don't want to bring it up.
What am I lying?
He went jogging and he comes home.

2497
02:13:30.960 --> 02:13:33.680
He's all sweaty and then the next scene he doesn't have any sweat and then the

2498
02:13:33.681 --> 02:13:35.820
next scene he's sweating and looking back.
Yeah,

2499
02:13:35.821 --> 02:13:40.150
they go back and forth to him being soaked with sweat and no sweat and soak

2500
02:13:40.151 --> 02:13:43.990
sweat.
Very,
very shitty job.
Whoever was the,

2501
02:13:43.991 --> 02:13:48.991
the set person that dealt with the wardrobe continuity with the sweat spray.

2502
02:13:49.110 --> 02:13:49.351
Well,

2503
02:13:49.351 --> 02:13:53.070
that's a real problem with girls because Lena Dunham has a severe perspiration

2504
02:13:53.071 --> 02:13:57.150
problem.
She doesn't shower as well.
What do you mean she doesn't shower?

2505
02:13:57.180 --> 02:13:58.450
I'm making stuff up.
I want to spell it.

2506
02:13:58.710 --> 02:14:01.110
How dare you see now you're proud of the problem.

2507
02:14:01.680 --> 02:14:02.820
Then you need to get laid at denim,

2508
02:14:02.850 --> 02:14:07.820
but you are what you are is what they think you are.
Then you'd be dipping.

2509
02:14:07.890 --> 02:14:12.030
And I am me this,
she mean when someone like Lena Dunham,
you claim rape falsely.

2510
02:14:12.270 --> 02:14:16.780
I know I've,
I know someone very close to me who was raped.
Um,

2511
02:14:17.280 --> 02:14:19.500
the same thing,
you know,
my wife and I,
we volunteer,

2512
02:14:19.501 --> 02:14:21.660
but you're her more so at a special needs place.

2513
02:14:21.900 --> 02:14:24.720
And so when people fame this offense at re retarded,

2514
02:14:25.290 --> 02:14:28.860
I've watched special needs people call other special needs people retarded.
Well,

2515
02:14:28.861 --> 02:14:32.610
the problem is retarded doesn't mean down syndrome.
It just doesn't.

2516
02:14:32.640 --> 02:14:34.200
And you know the real well,

2517
02:14:34.201 --> 02:14:37.480
they used to put on people's birth certificates when they were born with down

2518
02:14:37.481 --> 02:14:40.740
syndrome.
They used to call them mongoloid idiots.

2519
02:14:40.950 --> 02:14:44.970
That was literally what they used to put the medical term for someone who had

2520
02:14:45.030 --> 02:14:49.470
down syndrome.
Like what?
Retarded is to retard growth.
What does that mean?

2521
02:14:49.471 --> 02:14:54.030
That you are slow.
You are behind.
Like if you're a fucking dummy,
you're retarded.

2522
02:14:54.060 --> 02:14:58.670
What do you do?
The word retarded,
Tama talk like,
oh,
excuse me,
wash y'all.

2523
02:14:58.690 --> 02:15:00.670
Hotdog means,
sorry,
I'm late.
Ah,

2524
02:15:00.900 --> 02:15:04.320
taller needs to be late to be slow to arrive and it comes from us.

2525
02:15:04.321 --> 02:15:07.590
All the romance languages come from Latin.
And so that's where it comes from.

2526
02:15:07.591 --> 02:15:09.540
Which just like Negro is not racist.

2527
02:15:09.541 --> 02:15:14.120
And Doe people sat it was racist and they forgot to tell all the United Negro

2528
02:15:14.120 --> 02:15:17.130
College Fund this or how about the only other way paint,
that's the craziest one.

2529
02:15:17.131 --> 02:15:19.860
National Association for the advancement of colored people.

2530
02:15:20.160 --> 02:15:25.050
Like what is funny about her that was funny about that woman,
you know,

2531
02:15:25.051 --> 02:15:25.680
the uh,

2532
02:15:25.680 --> 02:15:29.820
the Rachel Dolezal check who was actually really white and pretended to be black

2533
02:15:29.821 --> 02:15:33.030
and had the fake Tan and all that jazz.
It's hilarious.

2534
02:15:33.300 --> 02:15:37.110
But what's hilarious is she is of color.
She's white.
You know,

2535
02:15:37.370 --> 02:15:40.620
it was not only that the NAACP was founded by white people,

2536
02:15:40.630 --> 02:15:43.290
was made by white progressive and when it was founded,

2537
02:15:43.291 --> 02:15:47.760
black people couldn't even hold.
They couldn't be in a position of leadership.

2538
02:15:47.761 --> 02:15:50.790
They weren't allowed to,
which is kind of fucked up.
Well,
what's funny,

2539
02:15:50.850 --> 02:15:53.970
what I find so funny about her as now the whole Trans phobic thing is a new

2540
02:15:53.971 --> 02:15:57.990
movement.
I think she has a black baby inside of her that she was pregnant.

2541
02:15:58.020 --> 02:16:01.470
It's like a,
uh,
uh,
she's blames Cameron Scifi Film.
Listen,

2542
02:16:01.471 --> 02:16:06.110
she's pregnant and you know that she's fucking black guys,
right?
She's saying,

2543
02:16:06.120 --> 02:16:08.820
don't know for a fact.
I wouldn't doubt it.

2544
02:16:08.850 --> 02:16:11.600
I'm going to bet a lot how much

2545
02:16:13.890 --> 02:16:17.310
I'm pushing the fuck and pilot ships and that she fucked a black guy.

2546
02:16:17.450 --> 02:16:20.550
Not to say anything wrong with that.
Here's what's so wrong with that whatsoever.

2547
02:16:20.551 --> 02:16:23.880
I just want to say that right away,
but I think maybe she wanted to have,

2548
02:16:23.881 --> 02:16:26.910
be a little more black.
She had a brother Shaun king too.
I mean,
listen,

2549
02:16:27.450 --> 02:16:30.340
we don't aspire to,
they don't aspire to be,
you know,

2550
02:16:30.370 --> 02:16:31.750
architects and aspire to be scientists.

2551
02:16:31.750 --> 02:16:33.540
They aspire to be professional victims that we ha,

2552
02:16:33.570 --> 02:16:34.500
that's what you have with Sean King.

2553
02:16:34.501 --> 02:16:37.780
I'm we with Rachel Dolezal all this money in that it's not just money.
There's,

2554
02:16:37.781 --> 02:16:40.930
there's,
there's,
I mean,
I shouldn't say this money in it,
but what I should say,

2555
02:16:40.940 --> 02:16:44.110
there's,
there's success in that.
Like,

2556
02:16:44.111 --> 02:16:47.260
if you can tap into that vein quite easily,

2557
02:16:47.261 --> 02:16:50.130
it doesn't require a lot of thinking and you,

2558
02:16:50.160 --> 02:16:55.060
you immediately get people that won't challenge it because it's one of those

2559
02:16:55.061 --> 02:16:55.960
things like if you,

2560
02:16:55.961 --> 02:16:59.720
if you become one of those people that becomes a professional victim,
boy,

2561
02:16:59.721 --> 02:17:02.170
you don't get challenged much.
It's just,
it's hands.

2562
02:17:02.171 --> 02:17:05.890
And I can see the headlines Right now at salon two white guys talk about the,

2563
02:17:05.891 --> 02:17:10.180
a black American left.
Well,
in all fairness,
I am Sicilian mostly,

2564
02:17:10.300 --> 02:17:13.120
and that means that I am of mixed heritage them.
He's my,

2565
02:17:13.150 --> 02:17:16.900
there's a black man would pile somewhere they were raped by the Moore's.

2566
02:17:16.900 --> 02:17:18.640
You saw true,
true romance.

2567
02:17:18.850 --> 02:17:21.730
That's the fact Mike fucking grandparents were from Sicily.

2568
02:17:21.980 --> 02:17:25.540
Black man jumping out of the shed somewhere down with one of your female is more

2569
02:17:25.541 --> 02:17:29.170
of a dark Muslim character.
Right.
The Moore's,
I think there were,
uh,

2570
02:17:29.290 --> 02:17:30.220
they were from Africa though.

2571
02:17:30.350 --> 02:17:33.460
One thing I thought about Rachel Dolezal you've got right.

2572
02:17:33.490 --> 02:17:37.660
Thinking about her a lot.
I do.
I do.
Uh,
the sideshow,
Bob is just,

2573
02:17:37.680 --> 02:17:42.040
it does it for me.
I think a,
you know a Cho Bob?
He had a sideshow Bob Hairdo.
Oh,

2574
02:17:44.200 --> 02:17:46.780
I don't even know what you mean that.
It's funny.
What does in sideshow,

2575
02:17:46.781 --> 02:17:51.160
shoebox trusty sidekick.
That's where it's from.
That's,
can you picture it now?

2576
02:17:51.190 --> 02:17:56.140
Yeah,
I can bring up slide show about.
Think about this for a second.
Well,

2577
02:17:56.141 --> 02:17:58.450
she had to do that.
Oh,
that's hilarious.

2578
02:18:00.310 --> 02:18:04.540
That's hilarious.
But she had to do that in order to look funny.

2579
02:18:04.541 --> 02:18:07.840
She did the black white girl hair,
so she got the perm,

2580
02:18:07.841 --> 02:18:11.260
but then she liked the light brown parent.
You're not the only one.

2581
02:18:11.290 --> 02:18:16.210
Look who did it better.
But here's the crazy thing.
Okay.

2582
02:18:16.220 --> 02:18:19.900
People say,
well,
Trans Racial thing,
transgender rights isn't in the thing.
Well,

2583
02:18:19.901 --> 02:18:22.480
that's what I'm saying.
Look,
Caitlin Jenner or Fallon Fox,
right.

2584
02:18:22.481 --> 02:18:25.480
Caitlyn Jenner can go through hormone replacement therapy,

2585
02:18:25.490 --> 02:18:29.110
get all the plastic surgery,
start changing his voice and guess what?

2586
02:18:29.111 --> 02:18:32.010
People see them and they still realize that's a dude.
Well,
you know,

2587
02:18:32.011 --> 02:18:36.790
it's Rachel knows all slapped on a tan and a perm and fooled the NAACP.

2588
02:18:36.970 --> 02:18:38.890
You tell me what's more realist.
Well,

2589
02:18:38.891 --> 02:18:43.450
she did go to an all black college and she got a scholarship day,
right?
Yeah,

2590
02:18:43.460 --> 02:18:45.600
but you go to Morehouse.
I don't know her.
I know Shaun King.

2591
02:18:45.640 --> 02:18:49.330
I know Shaun King got the black thing from Oprah.
What do you mean?
Yeah,

2592
02:18:49.331 --> 02:18:52.300
he got some kind of a scholarship for being a victim of a hate crime and he's a

2593
02:18:52.301 --> 02:18:55.570
black guy.
But what's funny is the actual police report from that crime,

2594
02:18:55.810 --> 02:18:58.000
he checked the Caucasian box.

2595
02:19:00.010 --> 02:19:04.100
So it's not only on your person,
that's a WHO's on first routine in the

2596
02:19:05.780 --> 02:19:10.750
no hate crime.
He has a black man.
You checked Caucasian.
That's right.
Oh my God.

2597
02:19:10.751 --> 02:19:13.120
Fuck.
I forgot what I was going to say because we were talking about,

2598
02:19:13.390 --> 02:19:17.860
that's so funny.
You broke my brain.
Oh,
the transgender thing.

2599
02:19:18.500 --> 02:19:19.240
That's what it was.

2600
02:19:19.240 --> 02:19:23.720
My fucking five year old man was watching Caitlyn Jenner on the,

2601
02:19:23.740 --> 02:19:28.340
the the show,
whatever it was when I am Cait,
whatever.

2602
02:19:28.520 --> 02:19:32.510
And she goes,
Mommy,
why is that man to ask why I got girl,

2603
02:19:33.260 --> 02:19:37.790
the five year old said that and my wife just covered her mouth like this.
Yeah.

2604
02:19:38.060 --> 02:19:41.720
That was me with my dad,
cause my,
and my daughter was serious.
She was serious.

2605
02:19:41.721 --> 02:19:46.720
She was like,
Mommy,
why is that man dress bag girl say it's normal.

2606
02:19:46.920 --> 02:19:50.150
It's weird.
She's beautiful.
You go girl.

2607
02:19:50.630 --> 02:19:53.090
My friend Whitney Cummings or I talked about this too many times,

2608
02:19:53.091 --> 02:19:53.930
I can't talk about it anymore.

2609
02:19:54.170 --> 02:19:57.140
She put it on her Instagram hero with a picture of him.
Mike,

2610
02:19:57.860 --> 02:20:00.950
I don't see a fireman.
I'm not.
See,
I don't see a first responder.

2611
02:20:01.010 --> 02:20:04.640
And he and he killed a guy.
Yes.
A girl.
Woman.
Oh girl.
That's right.

2612
02:20:04.641 --> 02:20:05.630
And pushed her into a real woman,

2613
02:20:05.810 --> 02:20:10.810
pushed her into traffic by spacing out behind the wheel and slamming a buck

2614
02:20:12.090 --> 02:20:16.340
angel who challenged me to a fight because I wrote about Fallon Fox and I was

2615
02:20:16.341 --> 02:20:19.880
like,
I mean,
did she write,
I wrote that.
Okay.
This was my argument.

2616
02:20:19.890 --> 02:20:20.750
This was a long time ago.

2617
02:20:20.751 --> 02:20:23.570
I read it when I was at Fox News and before anyone else was talking to him about

2618
02:20:23.571 --> 02:20:27.320
it,
I said okay,
because it wasn't really a national story.
Right.
Uh,

2619
02:20:27.350 --> 02:20:29.450
Christianne Cyborg,
right.

2620
02:20:29.451 --> 02:20:32.540
She had her belt removed Strikeforce because they found out she popped for

2621
02:20:32.541 --> 02:20:35.540
steroids.
Remember,
cause she took me on hormones.
Hormones,
right?
So they said,

2622
02:20:35.541 --> 02:20:37.940
okay,
that's enough.
We're going to take away your belt.
Right?
Why?

2623
02:20:37.941 --> 02:20:41.990
Because it's an unfair advantage.
Um,
well,
it's not just an unfair advantage.

2624
02:20:41.991 --> 02:20:46.550
It's a banned substance.
It's not even natural to your body.
Right?
Well,

2625
02:20:46.551 --> 02:20:50.120
my whole point is Fallon Fox has been taking steroids,
uh,
parole life.

2626
02:20:50.121 --> 02:20:51.470
They're called balls,
right?

2627
02:20:51.530 --> 02:20:53.630
Because if you actually look at a woman taking steroids,

2628
02:20:53.660 --> 02:20:57.680
it's still nowhere near the hormonal advantage that a man has over a woman.

2629
02:20:57.681 --> 02:20:58.514
As a matter of fact,

2630
02:20:58.850 --> 02:21:03.500
Arnold Schwartzenegger like a walking human pin cushion in his prime doesn't

2631
02:21:03.501 --> 02:21:07.370
enjoy the hormonal advantage over me that I enjoy over the basic woman.

2632
02:21:07.371 --> 02:21:11.920
It's that much of a gap.
So to act like it goes away because you know,
you,
you,

2633
02:21:11.921 --> 02:21:16.460
you,
you grab a hair straightener and you put on a bikini,
it's just not accurate.

2634
02:21:16.461 --> 02:21:19.520
And she,
and buck angel was like owl town.
I'm like,
first off,

2635
02:21:19.521 --> 02:21:21.260
there's a reason for weight classes.
Secondly,

2636
02:21:21.261 --> 02:21:24.050
of course we need to have the HIV testing all that cause you're a porn star.

2637
02:21:24.051 --> 02:21:26.900
Thirdly,
I'm not going to fight you.
You wouldn't fight.

2638
02:21:26.901 --> 02:21:29.480
Buck Buck's a nice guy,

2639
02:21:30.080 --> 02:21:33.230
but he's not that big and you're a lot bigger person.

2640
02:21:33.300 --> 02:21:35.640
When Buck Buck has a folio frame,
she,

2641
02:21:35.740 --> 02:21:40.310
he has small hands and small shoulders and this is the thing that it's hiding

2642
02:21:40.311 --> 02:21:43.790
behind the bully pulpit.
A gotten a woman like that.
No where else I'd be like,

2643
02:21:43.791 --> 02:21:46.310
Hey Stephen,
I want to fight you.
But because you said this about Fallon,

2644
02:21:46.311 --> 02:21:49.910
Fox was entirely accurate by the way,
and I stand by it.
I walk it back zero.

2645
02:21:50.060 --> 02:21:52.580
The whole trans community has to tell me I'm hateful.

2646
02:21:52.730 --> 02:21:56.300
Meanwhile Fallon Fox just beating the crap out of women and you know,

2647
02:21:56.450 --> 02:21:59.630
there's no technique there.
Alan Fox is not a good fighter.

2648
02:21:59.630 --> 02:22:03.560
It's just pure strength.
It looks very much like domestic violence.

2649
02:22:03.860 --> 02:22:07.160
Well it does when you watch it,
it really does.
And she's not very,

2650
02:22:07.340 --> 02:22:11.120
very technical and there's also really a problem.
There's a,

2651
02:22:11.150 --> 02:22:14.960
my friend Steph Daniel's wrote a piece for bloody elbow.

2652
02:22:15.080 --> 02:22:19.370
She wrote several pieces about this issue and she did a very good job of being

2653
02:22:19.520 --> 02:22:24.520
completely objective and interviewing a bunch of different experts on it and she

2654
02:22:24.531 --> 02:22:29.190
found that there is a big discrepancy between gender reassignment doctors,

2655
02:22:29.191 --> 02:22:32.850
quote unquote experts who have one opinion on it,
right?
You are a woman now,

2656
02:22:33.060 --> 02:22:36.360
you have no advantages whatsoever and those are the people that they,

2657
02:22:36.361 --> 02:22:40.430
they've talked to the,
you know,
the IOC and they've,
you know,

2658
02:22:40.470 --> 02:22:45.390
made it so that in the Olympics is no discrepancy.
But I,

2659
02:22:45.630 --> 02:22:49.080
my my,
my position is as a combat sports expert.

2660
02:22:49.110 --> 02:22:52.020
I think there's a giant difference between having a male frame and a female

2661
02:22:52.021 --> 02:22:55.770
frame.
Then there's this woman,
a doctor,
Ramona [inaudible],

2662
02:22:56.010 --> 02:22:57.090
who is a,

2663
02:22:57.091 --> 02:23:02.070
they wrote a piece for a bloody elbow and she went into great detail.

2664
02:23:02.071 --> 02:23:04.560
She's an endocrinologist,
board certified endocrinologist.

2665
02:23:04.561 --> 02:23:08.730
When do great detail about the significant advantages in bone density and the

2666
02:23:08.731 --> 02:23:09.840
fact that the bone density,

2667
02:23:09.841 --> 02:23:12.720
not only does it not decrease with the use of estrogen,

2668
02:23:12.870 --> 02:23:16.110
but estrogen is in fact what keeps bone density in women.

2669
02:23:16.320 --> 02:23:18.900
That's one of the reasons why when women dropped their estrogen,

2670
02:23:18.901 --> 02:23:21.390
as they get older,
they start getting osteoporosis.

2671
02:23:21.840 --> 02:23:26.310
And so she was saying that you have an advantage.
It preserves it.
Not only that,

2672
02:23:26.580 --> 02:23:30.480
there's advantages in terms of reaction time,
the,
the,

2673
02:23:30.481 --> 02:23:33.600
the average man or everything physically standing on percent,

2674
02:23:33.750 --> 02:23:36.330
10% faster reaction time than a woman,

2675
02:23:36.331 --> 02:23:39.270
which is massively significant when you're talking about striking,

2676
02:23:39.540 --> 02:23:44.340
when you see guys like Roy Jones Jr did you lose tick still faster than you or

2677
02:23:44.341 --> 02:23:48.960
me by a long shot?
But he leaves overall.
I don't know about brunch to 75,
bro.

2678
02:23:49.170 --> 02:23:53.910
Dude,
I hear you bro.
You don't have the rage that I get.
I don't my,
uh,
mental,

2679
02:23:54.240 --> 02:23:56.990
but why don't you go into Joey Dee said

2680
02:23:58.530 --> 02:24:03.090
that was don my rare again.
I didn't even,
you'd have to kill me.

2681
02:24:03.840 --> 02:24:06.300
Um,
but the um,
uh,

2682
02:24:06.301 --> 02:24:11.301
reaction times quicker and also the fact that you live your whole life as a man,

2683
02:24:11.610 --> 02:24:15.300
like your,
your body is your tendons.
Trank there's so many different things.

2684
02:24:15.420 --> 02:24:18.600
So Dr Ramona critique puts his piece out.

2685
02:24:18.870 --> 02:24:23.730
They fucking attack.
Stephie they attacked her.
Great job.

2686
02:24:23.731 --> 02:24:27.210
Ruining all your great work because she had interviewed all these different

2687
02:24:27.211 --> 02:24:29.790
people with different opinions.
It wasn't even her opinion.
You know,
she,

2688
02:24:29.810 --> 02:24:33.870
she went to a board certified endocrinologist who had an objective point of
view,

2689
02:24:33.960 --> 02:24:36.930
right?
And this person said,
yes,
there's significant advantages here.

2690
02:24:36.930 --> 02:24:40.230
They are scientifically laid out.
Here's something I wrote about that.

2691
02:24:40.231 --> 02:24:43.950
No one else really talks about all these organic sort of leftist Hippie Gras,

2692
02:24:44.010 --> 02:24:46.710
right?
They want organic and they don't want BPH.
Well,

2693
02:24:46.711 --> 02:24:50.460
what's the big problem with BPA,
right?
Xeno estrogens,

2694
02:24:50.820 --> 02:24:54.150
the people talk about it mimics estrogen in the body and that leads to cancer,

2695
02:24:54.151 --> 02:24:56.400
right?
Too many estrogen,
too much estrogen in the body.

2696
02:24:56.401 --> 02:24:58.590
They talk about that drinking hormones in the milk.

2697
02:24:58.591 --> 02:25:01.110
They talk about that with BPA and pesticides.

2698
02:25:01.470 --> 02:25:05.850
So we all widely acknowledged that estrogen elevated beyond normal levels in the

2699
02:25:05.851 --> 02:25:08.280
human body.
It's probably not great,
right?

2700
02:25:08.281 --> 02:25:12.210
For Human Health when injected directly into your ball sack.
However,

2701
02:25:12.570 --> 02:25:14.190
we're supposed to turn a blind eye and say,
well,

2702
02:25:14.191 --> 02:25:17.260
the science isn't in yet for the transgender community,
but don't,

2703
02:25:17.430 --> 02:25:19.860
don't drink from that plastic bottle.
Make sure it's a mason jar.

2704
02:25:19.861 --> 02:25:22.440
They got lives for that,
you know,
but we have to,

2705
02:25:22.441 --> 02:25:24.480
but when they're doing direct estrogen injections,

2706
02:25:24.490 --> 02:25:28.720
well we don't know really well then don't buy organic and drink up your BPA.

2707
02:25:29.500 --> 02:25:32.140
It becomes uh,
an ideological issue.

2708
02:25:32.141 --> 02:25:35.290
More than becomes a scientific course and you,
you are not allowed.

2709
02:25:35.291 --> 02:25:38.200
It's like we were talking about when we were talking about abortion earlier.

2710
02:25:38.380 --> 02:25:40.410
You're not allowed to have a varying opinion,
right?

2711
02:25:40.570 --> 02:25:43.840
Like you have to stay within the line.
It's like you said that I'm considered a,

2712
02:25:43.841 --> 02:25:47.800
you know,
I would be considered a left wing by a lot of people,
but I'm on,

2713
02:25:47.801 --> 02:25:52.160
I'm in the NRA.
I'm not a kid.
I didn't want to bring it up.
Talk about it.

2714
02:25:52.450 --> 02:25:56.290
I think you should be allowed to have guns.
I don't think that guns are bad.

2715
02:25:56.291 --> 02:25:58.060
I think we have,
I've,
I've wrote about this,

2716
02:25:58.061 --> 02:26:02.740
that we have a mental health problem disguise as a gun problem.
Yeah.
And that's,

2717
02:26:02.741 --> 02:26:04.250
that's a real problem there.

2718
02:26:04.490 --> 02:26:09.100
There's a real issue with mental health in this country and I don't know if it's

2719
02:26:09.101 --> 02:26:12.940
unique to this country or if the problem is that these people that have these

2720
02:26:12.941 --> 02:26:16.790
mental health issues have more access to guns and they have another states or in

2721
02:26:16.791 --> 02:26:20.320
other countries rather,
but I don't think the issue is removing the guns.

2722
02:26:20.320 --> 02:26:24.610
I think the issue is trying to figure out as an advanced society with a nuanced

2723
02:26:24.611 --> 02:26:25.660
objective point of view,

2724
02:26:25.661 --> 02:26:30.490
why people would ever want to kill a bunch of people they don't know what is it

2725
02:26:30.491 --> 02:26:34.600
that is causing folks do that,
not what are the tools they're using to do that.

2726
02:26:34.601 --> 02:26:37.690
That doesn't make any sense to me and taking those tools away from people that

2727
02:26:37.691 --> 02:26:38.524
would never do that.

2728
02:26:38.890 --> 02:26:42.670
I know so many hunters and so many people that are gun enthusiasts that are the

2729
02:26:42.671 --> 02:26:46.750
nicest fucking people in the world and don't do a goddamn thing wrong every day

2730
02:26:46.930 --> 02:26:50.020
and to think that you can take away their rights,

2731
02:26:50.350 --> 02:26:55.350
the own firearms because one crazy person does something right.

2732
02:26:55.870 --> 02:26:58.720
What are we going to do?
Have crazy people just drive into crowds.

2733
02:26:58.900 --> 02:27:01.900
What are we going to do when someone stomps on the gas and heads towards an

2734
02:27:01.901 --> 02:27:02.530
outdoor mall?

2735
02:27:02.530 --> 02:27:05.650
Just plows over a bunch of people because they have demons in their head because

2736
02:27:05.651 --> 02:27:07.420
they didn't take their pills that day.
I mean,

2737
02:27:07.421 --> 02:27:09.040
we've got to take away the right to drive.

2738
02:27:09.170 --> 02:27:12.040
I mean it seems like we're going down that road anyway with these,

2739
02:27:12.340 --> 02:27:15.310
these cars that are going to be self driving.

2740
02:27:15.490 --> 02:27:19.540
I mean there's going to be issues involving the rights of people to just decide

2741
02:27:19.541 --> 02:27:23.050
to go out for a drive.
The second amendment is the right to self preservation.

2742
02:27:23.051 --> 02:27:24.430
You know,
when people go like,
well,
what are you good?

2743
02:27:24.431 --> 02:27:28.780
So when I came back when people had muskets,
right?
Why did a video on that?

2744
02:27:28.781 --> 02:27:31.750
You do realize that's completely on clues.
Penis,
small penis,

2745
02:27:32.620 --> 02:27:35.830
the puggle gun jeer and Doni air rifle,
Belton Flintlock,
you know,

2746
02:27:35.831 --> 02:27:40.340
there's guns could fire 30 rounds in a second,
you know,
or 20 seconds.
We have a,

2747
02:27:40.390 --> 02:27:44.500
uh,
a letter from,
I think it was Madison to a private ship,
but they said,
hey,

2748
02:27:44.501 --> 02:27:47.590
can we have canon is to stop piracy.
Second amended,

2749
02:27:47.591 --> 02:27:48.520
of course you can have canons.

2750
02:27:48.700 --> 02:27:51.880
So they knew as a of they had placed orders for some of these high capacity,

2751
02:27:51.881 --> 02:27:53.110
really advanced weapons.

2752
02:27:53.111 --> 02:27:55.390
It just wasn't cost effective for the American government.

2753
02:27:55.450 --> 02:27:58.830
When we're the second amendment drafted,
uh,
Gosh I don't,

2754
02:27:58.850 --> 02:28:02.320
I'm terrible with numbers,
but the puck Hogan and Abelton Flintlock and a,

2755
02:28:02.321 --> 02:28:06.160
a lot of these guns already exist in high capacity before the outlaw Josey Wales

2756
02:28:06.160 --> 02:28:11.020
Gatlin Gun.
Yes.
Yes.
With the shit.
Yeah.
Well I did a video on it.
You can,

2757
02:28:11.021 --> 02:28:15.880
I'll send it to you afterwards.
But um,
December 15,
19 1791 bill of rights.

2758
02:28:15.910 --> 02:28:20.400
Okay.
Hm.
Interesting.
That's why I never do the numbers.
1791 they,

2759
02:28:20.420 --> 02:28:25.150
they their suck.
No,
let's be honest.
Google Belton,
Flint lock puck Hogan.

2760
02:28:25.510 --> 02:28:28.250
I is,
but Google is your Andoni air rifle.
That's what they used.

2761
02:28:28.251 --> 02:28:31.480
Outfit Lewis and Clark did you earned during your rifle.
Really?
Yeah.

2762
02:28:31.550 --> 02:28:33.710
Fascinating weapon.
Right?
There was a first off.

2763
02:28:33.740 --> 02:28:37.460
That's not the argument you want to get into because the first amendment doesn't

2764
02:28:37.700 --> 02:28:40.970
only apply to a printing press,
right.
It doesn't,
it will do lives.

2765
02:28:40.971 --> 02:28:45.080
Need didn't have the internet back then pull that feathers they wrote with

2766
02:28:45.081 --> 02:28:49.820
feathers.
You can't just put anything you want on a blog.
I mean,

2767
02:28:49.821 --> 02:28:53.570
that's really the argument,
right?
Isn't it the comic or you've had in this show,

2768
02:28:53.571 --> 02:28:55.970
how about fucking a hunter s Thompson?
I mean,

2769
02:28:55.971 --> 02:28:59.540
if anybody violated what a lot of people would think the first amendment to

2770
02:28:59.541 --> 02:29:02.870
Stanford,
that guy took real facts and added fiction to them.
Right?

2771
02:29:02.930 --> 02:29:04.550
And that was the first amendment.
I mean,

2772
02:29:04.551 --> 02:29:08.330
he was allowed to do that mean he caused a fucking political candidate running

2773
02:29:08.331 --> 02:29:11.680
for president to lose his mind because people thought that he was on Ibogaine.

2774
02:29:11.690 --> 02:29:14.060
The guy had mental breakdowns.
I mean,

2775
02:29:14.061 --> 02:29:17.690
you know the whole thing with Ed Muskie when Ed must be President,
Oh my God,

2776
02:29:17.691 --> 02:29:20.900
you've got to see the movie.
Is it fear and loathing?
What is it?

2777
02:29:22.180 --> 02:29:26.030
What is the documentary Gonzo,
Gonzo.

2778
02:29:26.031 --> 02:29:27.800
And then there's something else behind it.
Whatever.

2779
02:29:27.801 --> 02:29:31.300
It's a fucking fantastic documentary.
Now.
That's the moment,
right?

2780
02:29:31.310 --> 02:29:34.670
Favorite offers where I could have just lied.
Did you realize that?

2781
02:29:34.700 --> 02:29:37.340
I see people do that,
like where you like,
do you know this?
And I could have said,

2782
02:29:37.790 --> 02:29:39.950
yes.
People do that all the time.

2783
02:29:40.340 --> 02:29:43.610
Gonzo the life and work of Dr. Hunter s Thompson.
That's amazing.

2784
02:29:43.611 --> 02:29:46.010
It's an amazing documentary.
It's so fucking good.

2785
02:29:46.280 --> 02:29:51.280
But it goes into great detail about how he would just add fiction to stories.

2786
02:29:51.321 --> 02:29:53.600
He was a journalist,
but he would just make shit up.

2787
02:29:53.780 --> 02:29:56.990
And so he made this shit up about them bringing in a Brazilian doctor because

2788
02:29:56.991 --> 02:30:00.500
they knew that muskie had some,
I began an addiction and he,
and he goes,

2789
02:30:00.501 --> 02:30:03.440
there was a rumor going around,
you know,
and so he was on,

2790
02:30:03.620 --> 02:30:06.920
I think it was the Dick Cavett show.
It's a fucking hilarious interview.

2791
02:30:07.010 --> 02:30:10.730
And he goes,
well,
there was a rumor going around,
uh,
a Shard of the rumor.

2792
02:30:11.930 --> 02:30:15.680
Well,
like Lena Dunham,
I said,
perspiration problem.
Did you start that?
Everybody?

2793
02:30:15.681 --> 02:30:17.930
I haven't perspiration problem.
I came here from Yoga class,
man,

2794
02:30:17.931 --> 02:30:19.730
I was soaking wet.
He came from Yoga class.

2795
02:30:20.030 --> 02:30:23.030
Now that the second amendment goes back to the issue of you either believe in

2796
02:30:23.031 --> 02:30:25.370
self preservation or not.
And that's why I know Amy's a friend of yours.

2797
02:30:25.371 --> 02:30:28.430
But when she gets up there and she's pushing gun control every single show,

2798
02:30:28.431 --> 02:30:33.431
is she pushing those specifically when someone wrote about it like gun control?

2799
02:30:33.590 --> 02:30:36.700
I believe that crazy people shouldn't be allowed to have guns.
I,

2800
02:30:36.890 --> 02:30:40.730
I believe that if you have a history of violent behavior and a history of

2801
02:30:40.731 --> 02:30:43.760
violent crime,
you shouldn't be able to go to a store and buy a gun.

2802
02:30:43.760 --> 02:30:46.490
I bet you believe the same thing.
You don't want to misspeak as to what it is.

2803
02:30:46.500 --> 02:30:50.850
It's chuck is split.
Well,
I do think those things,
but I also going gonna lead,

2804
02:30:51.100 --> 02:30:54.230
right?
Well,
no,
because the,
now see that's one thing where everyone goes,

2805
02:30:54.231 --> 02:30:56.470
well yeah,
of course we don't want crazy people getting guys,

2806
02:30:56.780 --> 02:31:00.230
but do you really want the government then deciding who's mentally fit?

2807
02:31:00.260 --> 02:31:03.260
If you'd taken a Xanax,
you're not mentally fit you,
right.
Anxiety,

2808
02:31:03.740 --> 02:31:07.550
Nick Diaz and your prescription for anxiety,
marijuana.
You can't buy a gun.
No,

2809
02:31:07.551 --> 02:31:07.751
I don't.

2810
02:31:07.751 --> 02:31:12.410
I don't believe that we have the parameters yet realize that federally for the

2811
02:31:12.411 --> 02:31:13.011
longest time,

2812
02:31:13.011 --> 02:31:16.100
that was actually the case that if you did have a prescription for medical

2813
02:31:16.101 --> 02:31:18.410
marijuana you can because it's federally illegal,

2814
02:31:18.411 --> 02:31:20.220
you weren't allowed to have a handgun that would make you,

2815
02:31:20.221 --> 02:31:22.170
it wasn't allowed to have a rifle.
Well that would make sense.

2816
02:31:22.200 --> 02:31:24.480
I mean Barack Obama's,
you know,
federally prosecuted,

2817
02:31:24.481 --> 02:31:26.820
even people in Colorado where he's talked about that,

2818
02:31:26.821 --> 02:31:28.440
that he doesn't really want to leave that to the stage.

2819
02:31:28.590 --> 02:31:31.470
I don't want to get off on the pot thing cause we actually agree on that.

2820
02:31:31.650 --> 02:31:35.160
But the,
the gun thing is,
it's an instinct for self.
It's self preservation.

2821
02:31:35.161 --> 02:31:36.960
So a lot of these celebrities,
for example,

2822
02:31:36.961 --> 02:31:39.780
I get really bothered personally because I've had to put my wife under security

2823
02:31:39.781 --> 02:31:43.560
watch cause of angry Muslims and members and when someone like

2824
02:31:45.200 --> 02:31:46.033
yeah

2825
02:31:48.140 --> 02:31:51.780
you're one of those guys like a break something up and you go yeah that too.

2826
02:31:52.560 --> 02:31:54.720
Oh you have a bunch of people here saying I doctored footage.

2827
02:31:54.721 --> 02:31:57.690
I was punched in the face on national television for what happened.

2828
02:31:57.810 --> 02:31:59.340
I was at a right to work rally,

2829
02:31:59.341 --> 02:32:03.390
it was being passed in Michigan and I was there arguing with people in a drunken

2830
02:32:03.391 --> 02:32:06.870
guy wheeled me in the face and uh,
there were about 5,000 new members.

2831
02:32:06.870 --> 02:32:09.330
They tore down a whole tent for people who are pro right to work.

2832
02:32:09.360 --> 02:32:11.370
You can Google it and people will say the footage was edited,

2833
02:32:11.371 --> 02:32:14.970
but there's also 12 minute footage had to put up on my channel.
Um,

2834
02:32:15.060 --> 02:32:17.100
people trying to send you which union?
Oh is he,

2835
02:32:17.101 --> 02:32:20.160
it was a meeting of right to work versus you know,

2836
02:32:20.161 --> 02:32:23.940
you need a whole bunch of unions.
So,
um,
this was,
uh,
was a pretty,

2837
02:32:23.941 --> 02:32:25.830
pretty big deal when it happened.
And um,

2838
02:32:25.980 --> 02:32:28.140
it's funny my dad watched it cause if you go back and watch it,

2839
02:32:28.530 --> 02:32:30.450
people tried to say,
Oh,

2840
02:32:30.451 --> 02:32:33.420
you shoved that old guy down and then he sucker punched you.
It's like,

2841
02:32:33.421 --> 02:32:35.760
well if that's the case,
I was looking for a fight,
I would have fought,

2842
02:32:35.761 --> 02:32:39.090
but there's about 3000 people there and I was going to be torn apart.

2843
02:32:39.210 --> 02:32:41.150
Who said you shoved the old guy?
Just people.

2844
02:32:41.160 --> 02:32:44.370
It's a whole conspiracy in the internet.
And I have a 12 minute video online.

2845
02:32:44.790 --> 02:32:45.600
Well I will,

2846
02:32:45.600 --> 02:32:48.990
I don't even want to get in to everything there because you can't pay attention

2847
02:32:48.991 --> 02:32:51.990
to you.
And then how ironic.
I don't have the attention span.

2848
02:32:51.991 --> 02:32:55.680
So my point is if you go watch it and knowing that we talked about Jujitsu and

2849
02:32:55.681 --> 02:32:58.560
stuff,
my dance like did you have a collar elbow tie?

2850
02:32:58.561 --> 02:33:01.470
And when you're going for Gucci Man,
I'm like,
yeah,
it was.
So you see me grab him,

2851
02:33:01.500 --> 02:33:03.420
he's wailing.
You were ready to toss them.

2852
02:33:03.450 --> 02:33:05.130
And I turned my hips and you can see the footage.

2853
02:33:05.131 --> 02:33:09.030
I turned my hips in and then I see,
it's like,
oh shoot,

2854
02:33:09.031 --> 02:33:12.730
there's 2000 other people.
And so I just cover Watson.

2855
02:33:12.910 --> 02:33:16.950
Now we have to do this.
Yes,
yes.
Uh,

2856
02:33:18.840 --> 02:33:19.860
back the fuck up.

2857
02:33:20.340 --> 02:33:24.060
So that's a tent that got torn down and you backed up.

2858
02:33:24.060 --> 02:33:27.450
Well this guy came in the back,
the fuck up over.
So this is what they say.

2859
02:33:27.451 --> 02:33:31.320
And you know,
if you are,
there's a,
oh,
he's swinging.

2860
02:33:32.070 --> 02:33:35.880
So see I turned my turn my hips and then just duck my head and go back cause I

2861
02:33:35.881 --> 02:33:39.770
really like terrible technique.
Your,
your hips were too far.
Yeah.

2862
02:33:39.960 --> 02:33:42.710
Well I did it if it's tough.
Did you get hit?
Yeah,

2863
02:33:42.720 --> 02:33:47.190
I got hit full line baby punches though.
That guy has shit technique too.

2864
02:33:47.560 --> 02:33:50.130
It's terrible.
I can't even do commentary for this fight.

2865
02:33:50.850 --> 02:33:51.930
But you're not expecting it.

2866
02:33:53.220 --> 02:33:57.690
Fucking guy was windup up roundhouse punch is like,
God what an asshole.

2867
02:33:58.410 --> 02:33:59.460
I've said this before.

2868
02:33:59.461 --> 02:34:02.970
Why do people who can't fucking fight at all think they can get in fights when I

2869
02:34:02.971 --> 02:34:06.650
was getting drunk off second and fumes not,
you know,
sounds shit that I'm saying.

2870
02:34:06.660 --> 02:34:08.490
I was getting drunk off second and funeral.
He's hammered.

2871
02:34:08.550 --> 02:34:12.310
Oh he's handing all work.
Yeah,
go fuck off.
Yeah.

2872
02:34:12.390 --> 02:34:16.410
Well there's a lot of footage there but a tow work right to the hate,

2873
02:34:16.411 --> 02:34:19.020
right to wear what?
What is right to work.
So you don't have to be,

2874
02:34:19.030 --> 02:34:21.430
that essentially means you don't have to be in a union to work.
Right.

2875
02:34:21.580 --> 02:34:24.460
Oh and they and so forth.
If there is a union,

2876
02:34:24.461 --> 02:34:28.350
like electrician's union or something like that.
So if there is a union,
yeah,
you,

2877
02:34:28.430 --> 02:34:32.740
you,
you should join their union or not.
So we talked about that.
Well,

2878
02:34:32.741 --> 02:34:35.230
there's a real issue with the UFC,
I'm sure you're aware of it.

2879
02:34:35.231 --> 02:34:36.480
The culinary union issue,

2880
02:34:36.550 --> 02:34:39.880
that video on legalizing it in New York and did it a long time ago.

2881
02:34:40.030 --> 02:34:44.230
We reported on it.
And um,
matter of fact,
the UFC was Jennifer wink back then.

2882
02:34:44.430 --> 02:34:46.240
I was working there.
They were like,

2883
02:34:46.810 --> 02:34:51.810
I don't want to say they were very controlling until they realize that I wasn't

2884
02:34:51.821 --> 02:34:54.970
trying to sand bag.
I'm like,
listen,
this is what I'm talking about.

2885
02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:59.560
I understand the union,
uh,
the,
the,
the,
uh,
uh,
culinary union and a,

2886
02:34:59.561 --> 02:35:01.540
I want it to be legal in New York.
But even then they were like,
well,

2887
02:35:01.541 --> 02:35:04.420
can you send us a cut of the video before it goes up?
And I was like,
no,
I can't.

2888
02:35:04.810 --> 02:35:07.810
So I interviewed shale and interviewed pat and I interviewed,
um,

2889
02:35:07.870 --> 02:35:11.740
Hanzo and a hundred Gracie and we talked about it.

2890
02:35:11.741 --> 02:35:13.270
And that's what a lot of people don't understand.

2891
02:35:13.271 --> 02:35:15.760
The Culinary Union in Nevada and they're vendetta.

2892
02:35:15.761 --> 02:35:19.830
And we talked about Bob was it,
you know the senator,

2893
02:35:19.840 --> 02:35:22.870
Congressman Terry said the reason I'm against MMA and New Yorkers because it's

2894
02:35:22.871 --> 02:35:25.630
violent.
Yeah,
that douchebag.
Well he's gone now,

2895
02:35:25.631 --> 02:35:29.560
but you got to rescue a show when I was on a show in Albany doing a radio show

2896
02:35:29.561 --> 02:35:34.561
and he called in to argue with me and I wish he had no arguments for us.

2897
02:35:34.600 --> 02:35:37.810
But what about football?
What about Bob [inaudible]?
He's a corrupt politician.

2898
02:35:37.840 --> 02:35:40.360
I mean,
didn't he get busted for corruption?
Well that's it.

2899
02:35:40.361 --> 02:35:43.270
The same guy when we talk about big money in politics and we won't have time

2900
02:35:43.271 --> 02:35:45.520
cause I think it's all going to go soon.
Well,
no,
no.

2901
02:35:45.550 --> 02:35:48.160
When people say coke brothers are big oil,
big Pharma,

2902
02:35:48.161 --> 02:35:50.200
you look at the top political donors of all time,

2903
02:35:50.201 --> 02:35:52.090
15 out of the top 20 are unions.

2904
02:35:52.300 --> 02:35:54.650
And I got into this argument over Twitter with gray Maynard and usually just

2905
02:35:54.651 --> 02:35:59.260
like,
no bro,
it's corporate.
I ain't go listen.
You want to talk about corporation?

2906
02:35:59.261 --> 02:36:03.400
No Bro.
That's great man.
Or do you guys again?
Um,

2907
02:36:04.420 --> 02:36:08.450
and I was like,
listen,
these are the top donors they get.

2908
02:36:08.500 --> 02:36:10.300
No one wants to talk about big unions.
By the way,

2909
02:36:10.301 --> 02:36:13.240
they get virtually 99% to Democrats.

2910
02:36:13.360 --> 02:36:17.950
Big banks give 51% Republican,
49% Democrat because they're hedging their bets.

2911
02:36:18.220 --> 02:36:20.170
Unions,
often public sector unions,

2912
02:36:20.171 --> 02:36:21.960
you have no choice in whether you can join or not.

2913
02:36:21.961 --> 02:36:23.950
And he's non right to work states you joined,

2914
02:36:23.980 --> 02:36:25.730
they take your dues and intern that you,

2915
02:36:25.731 --> 02:36:28.990
those use those dudes to elect more Democrats who give them more kickbacks.

2916
02:36:29.230 --> 02:36:31.420
So I just think,
yeah,
there's a lot of money in politics,

2917
02:36:31.421 --> 02:36:34.780
but everyone wants to talk about big oil and big Pharma and no one wants to talk

2918
02:36:34.781 --> 02:36:38.320
about big unions,
which is a far more influential force.

2919
02:36:38.620 --> 02:36:39.610
And they get away with murder.

2920
02:36:39.640 --> 02:36:42.040
They'd get away with what seems to be a part of the same problem.
Right.

2921
02:36:42.041 --> 02:36:45.130
It's like people get addicted to the money that comes out of that establishment.

2922
02:36:45.490 --> 02:36:47.780
They get addicted to the money.
You know,
they,
they,

2923
02:36:47.830 --> 02:36:49.010
that's what the culinary union,

2924
02:36:49.040 --> 02:36:53.560
they know that they can make something like $15 million a year if the station

2925
02:36:53.561 --> 02:36:56.680
casinos all went union.
Right.
And meanwhile,

2926
02:36:56.681 --> 02:36:59.550
the people that work in the casinos are voted against it.
Now,

2927
02:36:59.551 --> 02:37:01.810
I don't know the particulars of the case.
I don't know.

2928
02:37:02.170 --> 02:37:05.380
I don't know who's being told what to do,
but I know,

2929
02:37:05.390 --> 02:37:09.910
just know that is what the fact is.
They did vote and they voted to go non union.

2930
02:37:10.120 --> 02:37:11.860
But these fucking culinary union guys,

2931
02:37:11.861 --> 02:37:16.180
they been attacked in the UFC forever and they've been a lot of creepy shit to

2932
02:37:16.280 --> 02:37:18.200
the casinos that are nonunion.

2933
02:37:18.350 --> 02:37:21.590
They've set up shop outside these casinos and they were insulting people that

2934
02:37:21.591 --> 02:37:24.110
were walking into the casino.
Just patrons,

2935
02:37:24.230 --> 02:37:26.600
just regular customers shitting on this guys.

2936
02:37:26.770 --> 02:37:30.860
I mean there was this big thing on the video got released and the color in your

2937
02:37:30.861 --> 02:37:32.570
union looked horrible for,
of,
and it's,

2938
02:37:32.571 --> 02:37:35.840
I'm sure the unions are and people Nicole on or a union just like,

2939
02:37:35.841 --> 02:37:39.730
there's good people in every organization that's fucked ultimately.
But the,

2940
02:37:39.740 --> 02:37:43.550
the whole,
it's a mass man.
That's a mess that the unions in the Midwest,

2941
02:37:43.551 --> 02:37:44.241
those are the kinds of,

2942
02:37:44.241 --> 02:37:46.040
and that's how I was with my lawyers when we're dealing with this.

2943
02:37:46.100 --> 02:37:48.110
And there was a prosecutor in Michigan who was,

2944
02:37:48.170 --> 02:37:52.040
we found like almost all of his funding at that incident was the AFL CIO,

2945
02:37:52.041 --> 02:37:55.070
which is a big union.
Um,
and um,
matter of fact,

2946
02:37:55.071 --> 02:37:57.380
I was told there were about 50 people that day,
not just me.

2947
02:37:57.381 --> 02:37:59.510
He tried to file police reports because that whole tent you,

2948
02:37:59.540 --> 02:38:00.740
it was cut down with box cutters.

2949
02:38:01.010 --> 02:38:03.450
There's a black guy selling hot dogs who's thing was destroyed.

2950
02:38:03.451 --> 02:38:05.220
He was called the n word.
This whole thing happened that day.

2951
02:38:05.221 --> 02:38:09.050
I still have a piece of the tent and there were dozens of people tried to file

2952
02:38:09.051 --> 02:38:11.600
police reports and they said,
well,
we can't file police reports by phone.

2953
02:38:11.730 --> 02:38:13.310
It's completely absurd.
Of course he can.

2954
02:38:13.311 --> 02:38:15.890
If someone's raped in Florida and he moved back to Ohio,
you were on vacation,

2955
02:38:15.891 --> 02:38:17.570
you can call them and say,
my daughter was raped in Florida.

2956
02:38:17.930 --> 02:38:21.440
So a lot of people tried to file reports.
They weren't able to.
Uh,

2957
02:38:21.530 --> 02:38:25.490
a lot of people were in the tent when it went down and the same thing happened,

2958
02:38:25.500 --> 02:38:28.240
you know,
uh,
attack the Messenger.
Oh,
you,
you,
you will.

2959
02:38:28.250 --> 02:38:29.990
You really had no business being there.
You were provoking it.

2960
02:38:29.991 --> 02:38:33.530
Here's the beauty about assault.
If I right here,
go,
Hey Joe Rogan,

2961
02:38:33.531 --> 02:38:36.200
I think you suck nanny,
nanny,
boo boo.
You can't hit me.
Guess what?

2962
02:38:36.590 --> 02:38:39.470
You still can't hit me.
Right.
That's the law,
right?

2963
02:38:39.471 --> 02:38:42.890
You're only allowed to hit someone if you really believe that your life or your

2964
02:38:42.891 --> 02:38:47.660
health.
Yeah.
So most of the time you kind of be hit first.
Yeah.

2965
02:38:47.960 --> 02:38:50.300
I mean,
it's hard to argue otherwise.
I mean,

2966
02:38:50.301 --> 02:38:53.480
if two people are staring at each other and they're yelling at each other and

2967
02:38:53.481 --> 02:38:57.320
someone decides to throw the first punch,
that person is the antagonist.

2968
02:38:57.321 --> 02:38:59.780
That's the person who caused the issue.
Well,

2969
02:39:00.090 --> 02:39:02.090
there's mutual combat laws and all that stuff,
but,
well,

2970
02:39:02.091 --> 02:39:06.320
in Seattle it's in Washington state was the name of the Superhero Guy.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2971
02:39:06.321 --> 02:39:10.740
Well,
I'm a Phoenix Jones.
He's a good fighter.
Yes he is.
That's the fucking lake.

2972
02:39:11.520 --> 02:39:14.860
It's fucking very,
you'll see that when we were like mutual combat.
Yeah.

2973
02:39:15.380 --> 02:39:20.340
Let me just like kick in.
The guy stopped and that he,
the guy was like,
oh no.

2974
02:39:20.390 --> 02:39:24.770
Oh,
I've made a bad choice.
Yeah,
he's really good.
That's your problem.

2975
02:39:25.310 --> 02:39:29.810
What's the name?
Fuel door.
Uh,
Carlos photo or photo is,
is,
is,
that's his brother.

2976
02:39:29.811 --> 02:39:32.210
His brother's a fighter too.
Yeah.
I don't know what his name is,

2977
02:39:32.211 --> 02:39:35.570
but know what is this?
He calls himself Phoenix Jones.
Right.

2978
02:39:35.600 --> 02:39:38.930
What is his real name?
He's a fucking very good fighter though.
You could say.

2979
02:39:39.150 --> 02:39:44.100
It's really almost mean.
You know,
there's walks around with a superhero.
It's not,

2980
02:39:45.320 --> 02:39:49.520
it's not fair at all because he's fucking good.
I don't want to fight.

2981
02:39:49.550 --> 02:39:53.570
I'm here to keep peace.
But you know,
deep down it's like gimme gimme a reason.

2982
02:39:53.950 --> 02:39:58.130
Yeah.
It's hilarious for him.
But he's been stabbed.
Like he's,
he's like,

2983
02:39:58.160 --> 02:40:00.300
he's had like legit issues.
Well yeah.

2984
02:40:00.380 --> 02:40:04.800
Broken up fights or stopped robberies and stuff.
Well,
the worst part is like,

2985
02:40:04.801 --> 02:40:08.650
there was one was like the domestic abuse case and um,
those were always got it.

2986
02:40:08.780 --> 02:40:09.980
Well,
cause it doesn't matter.

2987
02:40:09.981 --> 02:40:11.780
The woman's still going to protect your man even if it's wet.

2988
02:40:11.781 --> 02:40:14.970
And so he goes under step.
Right.
And then hey,
she's wailing on him.

2989
02:40:15.270 --> 02:40:18.000
You ever seen that will give you,
you do that one?
I don't even want to see it.

2990
02:40:18.001 --> 02:40:21.300
Domestic views,
abuse cases.
They fucking freaked me out cause I grew up more,

2991
02:40:21.310 --> 02:40:25.690
more women committed to men.
Really?
Yeah.
By far.
It's not even close.
What?

2992
02:40:25.770 --> 02:40:28.360
That's why there's something not even close.
Not even close.
Yeah,

2993
02:40:28.361 --> 02:40:31.740
but they don't do much damage.
That's the point.
Yeah.
That's the point.

2994
02:40:31.741 --> 02:40:32.540
We let him go.

2995
02:40:32.540 --> 02:40:35.700
Ronda Rousey admitted recently that she beat the shit out of one of her ex

2996
02:40:35.701 --> 02:40:39.090
boyfriends because she caught him taking pictures of her and everybody's like,

2997
02:40:39.120 --> 02:40:40.920
well,
fucking free pass.

2998
02:40:43.920 --> 02:40:47.100
First of all,
I believe it because it's Ronda Rousey.

2999
02:40:48.130 --> 02:40:52.050
Well on side.
She beat the fuck.
Well I know the dude,
he's actually a very,

3000
02:40:52.051 --> 02:40:55.410
he's a very good fighter.
He could find himself.
But when,

3001
02:40:55.440 --> 02:40:59.900
when Ronda Rousey says she beat dude's ass,
everybody goes,
I can see that.

3002
02:40:59.910 --> 02:41:02.700
But that's probably because of the Tom Jones Syndrome where he realized he was

3003
02:41:02.701 --> 02:41:05.490
wrong and took it.
And then you see her with the [inaudible] syndrome.

3004
02:41:05.491 --> 02:41:08.550
What's that?
He will have to famous calm Jones,
the singer Tom Jones.

3005
02:41:08.551 --> 02:41:10.980
He talked about when he cheated on his wife and she found out and she just beat

3006
02:41:10.981 --> 02:41:11.740
the hell out of them.
He's like,

3007
02:41:11.740 --> 02:41:13.230
I have to sat there and took it because I deserved it.

3008
02:41:13.800 --> 02:41:15.750
And that's usually what happens in domestic abuse most.

3009
02:41:15.840 --> 02:41:18.570
This is actually something you should have her on Karen Straughn what?

3010
02:41:18.571 --> 02:41:23.000
We talked about it.
Oh,
that girl writes what chick I really love to have her on.

3011
02:41:23.860 --> 02:41:26.640
She talked about it how,
you know,
men were unfair,

3012
02:41:26.660 --> 02:41:28.230
were have always been punished for domestic abuse.

3013
02:41:28.231 --> 02:41:31.050
It's not like it's ever been okay.
Uh,
Theodore Roosevelt,

3014
02:41:31.110 --> 02:41:34.350
I think it was Teddy Roosevelt in 1906 wanted to bring back the whipping post

3015
02:41:34.560 --> 02:41:37.590
for domestic abuse because he thought it was unfair to put a man in prison

3016
02:41:37.591 --> 02:41:41.730
because then he could no longer provide for his woman.
On the flip side,

3017
02:41:41.731 --> 02:41:43.170
if a man was domestically abused,

3018
02:41:43.171 --> 02:41:46.220
you were basically dragged to the street and shamed.
So,
um,

3019
02:41:46.260 --> 02:41:48.710
most men never reported,
dragged them to the street.
I mean,

3020
02:41:48.720 --> 02:41:51.720
they would parade you through.
You'd be reshaped bitch.
That's not policy.

3021
02:41:51.750 --> 02:41:56.010
Whipping posts was policy.
This is cultural sort of context.
Gotcha.
Um,
but yeah,

3022
02:41:56.011 --> 02:42:00.360
domestic abuse is actually higher and lesbian communities.
What?
Yeah,

3023
02:42:01.140 --> 02:42:04.110
yeah.
It's higher in lesbian can well per capita,

3024
02:42:04.290 --> 02:42:08.280
but there's not that many lesbians.
Right.
So I don't have a charge,

3025
02:42:08.281 --> 02:42:09.480
but I imagine there's,
yeah,

3026
02:42:09.580 --> 02:42:14.580
there's less confidence per capita as much I would wager.

3027
02:42:15.060 --> 02:42:18.690
Um,
so it's,
uh,
how much higher though?
I don't have the numbers in front of me.

3028
02:42:18.720 --> 02:42:22.710
It's like Jamie does Jamie look up domestic violence in the lesbian community.

3029
02:42:22.740 --> 02:42:25.620
It's not as much higher between the lesbian community and the straight community

3030
02:42:25.621 --> 02:42:29.610
as it is between women against men.
So women versus men.

3031
02:42:29.640 --> 02:42:32.520
Domestic violence is just reported domestic violence.

3032
02:42:33.300 --> 02:42:36.230
Women getting smacked around.
They don't report it.
Honest question.
Okay.

3033
02:42:36.231 --> 02:42:38.920
Your wife ever smacked,
you know,
she ever punched you in the arm?
No.

3034
02:42:38.980 --> 02:42:42.480
She's not like that.
Really?
No.
She's not like that at all.
She's super easy.

3035
02:42:42.720 --> 02:42:46.170
Gone Do.
My wife's like punched me in the arm.

3036
02:42:46.171 --> 02:42:49.110
I can't really up around violence and I don't like it.

3037
02:42:49.140 --> 02:42:52.920
I mean it sounds crazy talking to a guy as a cage,
fighting commentary has done,

3038
02:42:53.880 --> 02:42:57.250
done martial arts his whole life.
But I don't like violence.
I don't even know.

3039
02:42:57.251 --> 02:43:01.130
I don't like action.
I don't mind seeing it.
Like I don't lie.

3040
02:43:01.140 --> 02:43:05.370
I like fights and I've,
I've,
I've like always enjoyed competing.
I don't,

3041
02:43:05.400 --> 02:43:08.430
it's not that,
but that doesn't seem like violence to me even though it is.

3042
02:43:08.820 --> 02:43:10.740
That is,
uh,
you were,
you were,

3043
02:43:10.990 --> 02:43:15.990
you have a mutually agreed upon meeting of two very skilled people who are going

3044
02:43:17.561 --> 02:43:22.300
to try to impose their discipline,
their will,
their focus,
their technique,

3045
02:43:22.301 --> 02:43:24.430
their intelligence and their preparation on each other.

3046
02:43:24.460 --> 02:43:26.830
That's how I look at fighting.
Yeah.
It's what I don't like.

3047
02:43:26.831 --> 02:43:28.300
People that love each other,
hitting each other.

3048
02:43:28.301 --> 02:43:31.540
That shit drives me crazy cause I grew up with it and I don't,
I don't,

3049
02:43:31.810 --> 02:43:34.660
I would never date a girl who tried to photos.
Okay.

3050
02:43:35.170 --> 02:43:39.660
I don't want to make my wife's not a monster.
Beat your ass.
Fuck you up when my,

3051
02:43:39.690 --> 02:43:42.580
it's got rain,
she's six foot and she's got this,
she's got a log jam.

3052
02:43:42.600 --> 02:43:46.370
She was a runway model for years.
Um,
she like,
you know,
and,
and I milked,

3053
02:43:46.500 --> 02:43:49.660
it didn't hurt,
but you know,
it's a good example right here.
But you milk.
Yeah.

3054
02:43:49.770 --> 02:43:52.420
Milk that.
I went to the bar and left and I was like,
you know what,

3055
02:43:53.110 --> 02:43:55.900
I need to cool down.
I'm turning around like,
I'm like,
Gosh,
I've,
you know,

3056
02:43:55.901 --> 02:43:58.870
I can get whatever I want for the next week.
Terrible.
Don't do that.

3057
02:43:58.871 --> 02:44:01.960
It's bad for your marriage.
But it worked.
Um,
I will say this,

3058
02:44:02.290 --> 02:44:04.120
that a good example is like a dog.

3059
02:44:04.240 --> 02:44:07.450
I see little dogs get into fights all the time.
They don't hurt each other.

3060
02:44:07.510 --> 02:44:10.420
If hopper does it,
they take them away.
They take them away.

3061
02:44:10.480 --> 02:44:12.390
Of course he's never done it.
But I've had it,

3062
02:44:12.391 --> 02:44:15.190
he was bitten by a little Pomeranian.
And uh,

3063
02:44:15.370 --> 02:44:19.950
one time a dog did bite and it was the only time he actually had Blackford and

3064
02:44:19.951 --> 02:44:21.280
its teeth.
But here's the thing,

3065
02:44:21.281 --> 02:44:23.140
if hopper wanting to bite his Nike would have been his neck.

3066
02:44:23.170 --> 02:44:24.670
People don't realize dogs.
That's a clipping.

3067
02:44:24.671 --> 02:44:29.090
That's like the mom sound of the teeth.
That's to say back off.
But uh,
I,

3068
02:44:29.250 --> 02:44:33.330
you know my friend actually my producer gay Jared,
he's got a little,
uh,
uh,

3069
02:44:33.340 --> 02:44:36.370
Australian shepherd and they'll get into fights.
Home Gauge,
Jared,

3070
02:44:36.570 --> 02:44:40.540
is that what call them is Chris' name?
Gay claims isn't that good.
Juries to them.

3071
02:44:40.690 --> 02:44:44.080
Okay.
His Twitter handle is not gay.
Jared,
you're going to follow his,

3072
02:44:44.110 --> 02:44:48.500
it's not gay,
Jared.
That's his Twitter handle.
It's not g a y.

3073
02:44:48.520 --> 02:44:51.340
You can follow them and draw your own conclusions.
Legally.

3074
02:44:51.341 --> 02:44:55.990
I'm obligated to say he's not
another one.
There's a lot of those guys.

3075
02:44:56.410 --> 02:44:57.790
I see.
I think it's fucked up,
man.

3076
02:44:57.791 --> 02:45:00.910
I think it should be really easy to be gay then we would find out who the fuck

3077
02:45:00.911 --> 02:45:03.850
is who?
No,
no,
no.
I wouldn't have a problem with a real number says he's not.
Okay.

3078
02:45:03.851 --> 02:45:04.600
Let's see here.

3079
02:45:04.600 --> 02:45:09.600
National Violence Against Women Survey found that 21.5% of men and 35.4% of

3080
02:45:10.601 --> 02:45:14.020
women living with same sex partners experience intimate partner.

3081
02:45:14.021 --> 02:45:17.500
Physical plant includes gain.
That's,
yeah,
that's exactly what you're saying.

3082
02:45:17.501 --> 02:45:21.640
So that shows that lesbians or more likely to be up their partners.

3083
02:45:21.641 --> 02:45:26.641
Then gay men are comparable with 7.1 and 20.4% for men and women respectively

3084
02:45:29.441 --> 02:45:33.160
with a history of only opposite sex cohabitation.
That's crazy.

3085
02:45:33.280 --> 02:45:38.280
So what that says is that 7.1% of women have experienced domestic violence by

3086
02:45:39.791 --> 02:45:40.540
men,

3087
02:45:40.540 --> 02:45:45.540
but 20.4% of men have experienced domestic violence by women.

3088
02:45:45.730 --> 02:45:48.910
The good thing,
what that says to me is that I am not alone.
Okay,

3089
02:45:48.911 --> 02:45:51.460
but that's Massachusetts.
See that right there.

3090
02:45:51.550 --> 02:45:54.580
Massachusets is filled with monsters drunk.

3091
02:45:54.581 --> 02:45:58.390
Those women fucking Queen,
they beat your ass.

3092
02:45:58.420 --> 02:45:59.590
They're terrible people.

3093
02:45:59.740 --> 02:46:02.830
They're only the only chick that I ever had take a swing at me.

3094
02:46:02.831 --> 02:46:04.870
It was a girl that I dated from Boston.
Really?

3095
02:46:05.110 --> 02:46:07.300
She took a swing at me while I was fighting.
I was,

3096
02:46:07.301 --> 02:46:10.610
I was in the middle of competition back then.
Like I was,
I was taekwondo.

3097
02:46:10.670 --> 02:46:14.060
I was now his kickboxing.
I was fucking crazy.
Like in,

3098
02:46:14.061 --> 02:46:16.370
this chick took a swing at me and I watched it coming and I was like,

3099
02:46:16.430 --> 02:46:18.380
I don't even believe this is happening.

3100
02:46:18.710 --> 02:46:22.190
And I ducked under it and I grabbed a hold of her.
I'm like,
what are you doing?

3101
02:46:22.340 --> 02:46:26.260
Are you hitting me?
He's trying to hit me.
I,
those are the only time I grow ag.

3102
02:46:26.270 --> 02:46:30.620
You fucking quit.
They're monsters.
They drunk,

3103
02:46:30.621 --> 02:46:33.110
they eating potatoes and just fucking swinging at you.

3104
02:46:33.560 --> 02:46:36.530
That's why it's Massachusetts.
I'll bet you look at the rest of the country.

3105
02:46:36.531 --> 02:46:39.730
It's probably totally different numbers.
No,
I don't think it's totally remembers.

3106
02:46:40.050 --> 02:46:43.070
Speaking of kickboxing,
have you seen Guy Masco recently?
Yeah.

3107
02:46:43.130 --> 02:46:46.970
That guy's in great shape for his age.
Oh,
he's in very good shape.
He's on.

3108
02:46:47.060 --> 02:46:52.040
He's had some,
um,
some issues with the cognitive,
um,
behave,
you know,

3109
02:46:52.041 --> 02:46:56.570
is,
is,
is,
is damaged from his fighting career.
But,
uh,
he's actually,

3110
02:46:56.571 --> 02:46:59.450
I have to have him on because we talked about this.
He's,

3111
02:46:59.451 --> 02:47:01.640
he's gone through some pretty unique therapy.

3112
02:47:01.850 --> 02:47:06.140
There's a guy in Dallas that's a doing some very unique therapy,

3113
02:47:06.170 --> 02:47:10.340
dealing with a lot of the cognitive issues that he had because it was a longterm

3114
02:47:10.341 --> 02:47:11.630
fighting career.
Well,
he's closer.

3115
02:47:11.631 --> 02:47:15.150
He's really taking my dad under his wing guy is,
he's a great dude.

3116
02:47:15.860 --> 02:47:20.210
He's a great guy,
but I know couldn't,
it's too of great guy.
He's a great guy.

3117
02:47:20.211 --> 02:47:23.750
He really is.
He's very intelligent and he's,
he's soft spoken.

3118
02:47:23.751 --> 02:47:27.770
He's just a really good person.
Yeah,
he really,
really is.
And he's been very,

3119
02:47:27.771 --> 02:47:31.160
very supportive of my father there.
And there've been like Jitsu,

3120
02:47:31.161 --> 02:47:35.240
politics and stuff.
So my dad actually moved there from another school and um,

3121
02:47:35.580 --> 02:47:39.560
I was just gonna say,
I mean to Jitsu politics.
How gross.
Well,

3122
02:47:39.561 --> 02:47:42.680
you know what it is now.
The world's longest talked about that.
Like,
I've been a,

3123
02:47:43.460 --> 02:47:45.050
I've been a blue belt,

3124
02:47:45.051 --> 02:47:48.710
frightened and I can't remember how long because I moved and they thought it was

3125
02:47:48.711 --> 02:47:53.030
like an act of disrespect and I had to compete to get my blue belt.
Joe.

3126
02:47:53.360 --> 02:47:54.950
I had to win.
It's like it doesn't mean much,

3127
02:47:54.951 --> 02:47:59.150
but I had to win Naga worlds at White,
which in Dallas,

3128
02:47:59.151 --> 02:48:01.250
which means you might have a few people coming in from like 15 states,
you know,

3129
02:48:01.251 --> 02:48:04.700
it might be 1215 people in your division,
you are likely sandbank.
Right,
right.

3130
02:48:04.970 --> 02:48:09.530
And then it was like we've had people who were demoted from a demoted,

3131
02:48:09.531 --> 02:48:11.960
demoted because of like you trained with other people.

3132
02:48:11.961 --> 02:48:15.350
So it's just one of those deals.
My Dad's are training two,
three years after me,

3133
02:48:15.351 --> 02:48:17.450
he got us kind to get away from any school that does that,

3134
02:48:17.451 --> 02:48:19.700
that there's only a few schools that do do that.

3135
02:48:19.701 --> 02:48:20.990
But God damn it when they do that,

3136
02:48:20.991 --> 02:48:24.980
it's so disrespectful and it's so bad for the whole overall community of martial

3137
02:48:24.981 --> 02:48:27.890
arts because it turns people off when they realize that there's that kind of

3138
02:48:27.891 --> 02:48:30.110
politics.
It's terrible man.

3139
02:48:30.160 --> 02:48:33.740
That mean Eddie Bravo experienced that for the longest fucking time because they

3140
02:48:33.741 --> 02:48:38.741
thought he was disrespectful because he was teaching no Guid Jujitsu cause he

3141
02:48:39.021 --> 02:48:42.560
decided to develop a GNOCCHI system.
Not even realize that he's fucking,

3142
02:48:42.561 --> 02:48:45.560
he has a black them to John Jacques Machado.
Okay.
And,

3143
02:48:45.570 --> 02:48:47.540
and he trained with the Gif forever.
Right.

3144
02:48:47.541 --> 02:48:50.090
It's not that he doesn't want to train with the gies trying to train mixed

3145
02:48:50.091 --> 02:48:53.630
martial arts fighters and he's developing a system that would work with mixed

3146
02:48:53.631 --> 02:48:56.690
martial arts competition,
which of course you can't work.
I will say though,

3147
02:48:56.691 --> 02:48:59.990
I will say this and I actually,
I think Eddie Bravo is an incredible grappler,

3148
02:49:00.170 --> 02:49:04.090
but there is nothing more frustrating than when you have a kid come in with the

3149
02:49:04.120 --> 02:49:07.440
long pants and he just wants to sit in rubber guard and doesn't know how to it

3150
02:49:07.710 --> 02:49:10.950
because he's read a book and he's like talking about is edible mushrooms.

3151
02:49:10.951 --> 02:49:14.970
You're like,
how about,
how about you learn a hip bump bitch?
You know what I mean?

3152
02:49:14.971 --> 02:49:18.750
And then,
sorry.
Well you're always going to have problems.
Yeah,
I call that the,

3153
02:49:18.751 --> 02:49:23.080
the blue belt hysteria syndrome.
I'll tell you what,
when I was a branch of him,

3154
02:49:23.720 --> 02:49:25.290
you going to get that?
Yeah.
It's fun.

3155
02:49:25.500 --> 02:49:29.490
It's fun to be a contrarian's fun to go against the ground holding here.

3156
02:49:29.500 --> 02:49:31.980
This poor rubber guard.
And that's actually a good example.
You know,

3157
02:49:31.981 --> 02:49:35.340
one of my Brazilian instructors can't stand Eddie.
Um,
and you can go,

3158
02:49:35.341 --> 02:49:37.170
you know what he thought?
What's rubber guard?

3159
02:49:37.230 --> 02:49:42.230
I tell you what is Nuno Schembri he's taken from Nino know Schembri train with

3160
02:49:42.541 --> 02:49:44.660
it.
And I know,
I know all kinds of projects.

3161
02:49:44.690 --> 02:49:46.670
That kind of stuff you have to deal with and you Jitsu.

3162
02:49:46.710 --> 02:49:49.440
Well that's people that are silly.
How much did you go away?

3163
02:49:49.441 --> 02:49:51.780
This Brazilian Jiu Jitsu instructor.
How much?
What?

3164
02:49:51.810 --> 02:49:55.260
How much does he weigh this guy that doesn't like Eddie?
Well,
you'd have to 10.

3165
02:49:55.740 --> 02:49:59.160
That's a problem that he's about one 70.
If they're the same.

3166
02:49:59.230 --> 02:50:02.160
Well even though fucking that he approached me tap and learn something from

3167
02:50:02.161 --> 02:50:05.610
everyone.
Yeah.
But guys who talk shit like that and they've never experienced it.

3168
02:50:05.610 --> 02:50:09.270
You roll with Vinnie Magallanes Vanga mini.
Mini Magallanes is about two 12.

3169
02:50:09.310 --> 02:50:13.410
Brazilians really hate him.
Yeah,
they do.
Yeah,
they do.
Cause he came out and said,

3170
02:50:13.411 --> 02:50:16.290
and Brazilians,
Brazil's a crap hole compared to the United States.

3171
02:50:16.291 --> 02:50:21.210
I like living here.
And you done on your country.
I what?
The fight.

3172
02:50:21.240 --> 02:50:21.990
It's like,
well,
you know what?

3173
02:50:21.990 --> 02:50:26.940
He was a fight to fight them about like if you ever want to actually do an

3174
02:50:26.941 --> 02:50:29.800
impression,
like there are different dialects,
but Diego Brandao just imitate him.

3175
02:50:29.801 --> 02:50:32.970
It's the most city.
He's got a good one.
He's got a good one.

3176
02:50:32.971 --> 02:50:37.470
There's a lot of Diego Brandao.
Yeah,
he's well.
He looked really good.

3177
02:50:37.471 --> 02:50:39.720
And his last fight,
he,
what did he the fuck did he fight?

3178
02:50:39.750 --> 02:50:43.710
He fought a Japanese guy.
Um,
oh yeah.
Um,
it was in Japan,
wasn't it?

3179
02:50:43.711 --> 02:50:47.940
Yes.
[inaudible] did he phone on?
Mitzi gunky is really,

3180
02:50:47.941 --> 02:50:52.840
that's the guy that's one 35.
[inaudible]
guys.
45 I'm a cruise massacred.
Right.

3181
02:50:52.860 --> 02:50:56.900
He fuck somebody up though,
man.
What the hell was it?
Oh,

3182
02:50:56.910 --> 02:51:01.140
the dude throws that crazy fucking front kick.
Yeah.

3183
02:51:01.730 --> 02:51:02.080
Who knows?

3184
02:51:02.080 --> 02:51:06.510
I know that Jim Cuno got fucked up in his last fight by Tony Ferguson too.

3185
02:51:06.890 --> 02:51:10.620
He's having a,
hey,
you know who doesn't have racial guilt?
Who?
Japanese people.
No,

3186
02:51:10.621 --> 02:51:12.570
they don't.
They don't,
you're never going to hear Japanese people say,

3187
02:51:12.630 --> 02:51:16.720
I don't care what my grandkids look like.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

3188
02:51:16.740 --> 02:51:20.970
Racist as fuck.
Bob Sapp put him on a billboard eating bananas.
Yeah.

3189
02:51:20.971 --> 02:51:23.250
They make them eat bananas.
They didn't give a fuck.

3190
02:51:23.430 --> 02:51:26.370
We never see them recommending like a

3191
02:51:28.100 --> 02:51:30.930
giant sex toy ran with it to the bank.

3192
02:51:31.350 --> 02:51:34.380
He ran with it to the bank and then ran out of the cage.
Close money.

3193
02:51:34.410 --> 02:51:38.320
We actually had an issue with them.
What the Yakuza,
you know,
they,

3194
02:51:38.550 --> 02:51:42.210
there was an issue where they wanted him to fight without a contract and he was

3195
02:51:42.211 --> 02:51:43.790
like,
oh,
I need a con.
I have to fight that.

3196
02:51:43.791 --> 02:51:46.620
We give you a Kentucky after the fight.
What?
Well,

3197
02:51:46.621 --> 02:51:49.320
let me say one thing about guy massacre and we have to go right and I think

3198
02:51:49.321 --> 02:51:51.480
we're up.
It's,
we're about three hours.
Sorry guy.

3199
02:51:51.481 --> 02:51:53.140
Masker I will say it's just because I was,

3200
02:51:53.150 --> 02:51:57.660
it's my home gym button just for one second.
It's arguable.

3201
02:51:57.661 --> 02:52:01.080
Antonio was Jerry Noguera and the Rona fights.
Those were really close.

3202
02:52:01.200 --> 02:52:02.750
Those could have gone either way,
right?

3203
02:52:02.850 --> 02:52:06.640
If you reverse those and the Vandelay Headbutt doesn't happen and it goes to a

3204
02:52:06.641 --> 02:52:11.200
decision.
So he goes in the list of top light heavyweights ever.
Well,

3205
02:52:11.201 --> 02:52:13.840
he's an excellent fighter.
You know,
I mean,
he was always an excellent fun,

3206
02:52:13.841 --> 02:52:18.280
no one mentions them in the mix.
Wow.
That's unfortunate.
He was an early adopter,

3207
02:52:18.340 --> 02:52:18.761
you know what I mean?

3208
02:52:18.761 --> 02:52:23.761
He was one of the guys that know the real early days of MMA and he was also like

3209
02:52:24.131 --> 02:52:28.330
one of the best,
you look at like his style of kicking his kickboxing style.

3210
02:52:28.480 --> 02:52:32.500
He's one of the best traditional kickboxing style guys that like got into MMA.

3211
02:52:32.501 --> 02:52:35.410
He had like a lot of like really good skills back then.

3212
02:52:35.411 --> 02:52:37.510
But the Vandelay headbutt was a big turning point.

3213
02:52:37.960 --> 02:52:40.760
I mean he was doing well in that fight before that happened and uh,

3214
02:52:40.840 --> 02:52:43.800
Vandelay headbutted him.
It was,
I'm not saying it would have won the fight.
No,

3215
02:52:43.870 --> 02:52:46.780
but I'm saying if he did get a couple of those controversial decisions and they

3216
02:52:46.781 --> 02:52:49.250
go the other way,
you put them right up there.
Right.

3217
02:52:49.390 --> 02:52:52.050
Guys like Tito and chuck and I mean he was doing well,
you know,

3218
02:52:52.150 --> 02:52:54.910
he was doing really well with chuck until that he got clipped,

3219
02:52:54.940 --> 02:52:58.600
which is when I was a monster back then.
He was really a monster.
It was,

3220
02:52:58.601 --> 02:53:02.320
it's interesting because chuck style back then was to take shots cause his chin

3221
02:53:02.321 --> 02:53:06.820
was so fucking sturdy to take shots and just stay in the pocket and blast you.

3222
02:53:07.060 --> 02:53:11.800
And then eventually that gave out the chin gave out and like he's the best

3223
02:53:11.801 --> 02:53:14.260
example of why you can't fight like that.

3224
02:53:14.261 --> 02:53:17.110
Like look at a guy who had a chin that was so amazing.

3225
02:53:17.710 --> 02:53:22.710
Imagine if chuck with that Chin fought like Tj Dillashaw fought and elusive fast

3226
02:53:24.071 --> 02:53:28.270
moving fast footwork style where it's very hard to hit but still had that

3227
02:53:28.271 --> 02:53:31.990
ridiculous power.
Yeah man.
I mean obviously they're different weight classes.

3228
02:53:31.991 --> 02:53:34.090
It would be very difficult for him to move like that.

3229
02:53:34.091 --> 02:53:38.170
But if you fought a more defensive oriented style with that punching power and

3230
02:53:38.171 --> 02:53:40.930
just utilize it sparingly at openings,

3231
02:53:40.931 --> 02:53:44.230
but then he wouldn't have been chocolate Adele that no shot knock out.

3232
02:53:44.230 --> 02:53:46.340
It's one of the words that the proceeds horrific.
Yeah.

3233
02:53:46.420 --> 02:53:49.900
Well the rich Franklin one was even more disturbing to me because it didn't look

3234
02:53:49.901 --> 02:53:53.500
like you get hit that hard and it just,
he just put,
his body was already done.

3235
02:53:54.070 --> 02:53:56.680
You can only hitting the button so many times.
Sorry,

3236
02:53:56.681 --> 02:53:59.080
I didn't mean to take you down a rabbit trail.
Yeah,
no,
it's true.

3237
02:53:59.081 --> 02:54:02.080
It's totally true.
It's totally true.
It's,
and you know,

3238
02:54:02.081 --> 02:54:06.310
that's one thing that's like super important to tell young fighters.
You know,

3239
02:54:06.340 --> 02:54:08.170
I always say that mighty mouse is the best.

3240
02:54:08.320 --> 02:54:10.600
I really think he's the best fighter in the world.
Pound for pound.

3241
02:54:10.620 --> 02:54:13.450
And one of the reasons why he's a fucking guy doesn't get hit.

3242
02:54:13.780 --> 02:54:17.950
He's so slick and he moves so well and he's all about technique.
That's mine.

3243
02:54:17.951 --> 02:54:20.810
His last fight,
he goes,
look at me.
I'm pretty as a motherfucker come,

3244
02:54:20.880 --> 02:54:21.880
we'll five rounds.

3245
02:54:22.210 --> 02:54:24.790
I will say that bothers me because all the heavyweights don't have technique.

3246
02:54:24.791 --> 02:54:26.110
Here's one thing my dad and I talk about a lot.

3247
02:54:26.770 --> 02:54:31.580
The margin for error at heavyweight or light heavyweight is much less than a,

3248
02:54:31.730 --> 02:54:36.220
and maybe faster fact is.
Guess what?
You can take 50 shots at flyweight.

3249
02:54:36.400 --> 02:54:39.640
You take one shot wrong.
It happens.
There's a reason if you watch,

3250
02:54:39.670 --> 02:54:41.220
if you watch high level heavyweight Jujitsu,

3251
02:54:41.530 --> 02:54:45.380
they are fighting often to stay off the bottom.
Except for guys like Cyborg,
um,

3252
02:54:45.520 --> 02:54:47.410
because it's,
it's a whole different ballgame.

3253
02:54:47.530 --> 02:54:51.880
Elevating 250 pounds or getting hit by it.
So when people saying,
oh,

3254
02:54:51.881 --> 02:54:53.700
the heavyweights aren't as good technically I go,

3255
02:54:53.770 --> 02:54:55.540
actually the fact is you get hit,

3256
02:54:55.600 --> 02:54:59.200
you can't get hit once at heavyweight you have to be more invasive.

3257
02:54:59.201 --> 02:55:02.950
There's less room for error.
And it's not just because I'm a relatively big guy,

3258
02:55:03.080 --> 02:55:06.110
not,
you know,
I'd be a middle weight probably if I ever had the balls to fight,

3259
02:55:06.111 --> 02:55:10.700
which I don't.
But as someone who comes from a long line of heavyweights,

3260
02:55:10.701 --> 02:55:12.590
that's the first thing they say.
What if my dad runs over it more?

3261
02:55:12.591 --> 02:55:15.650
You're just big.
Well,
there is also the issue with gravity,

3262
02:55:15.800 --> 02:55:18.290
like the heavyweights have to deal with so much more gravity.

3263
02:55:18.291 --> 02:55:22.220
It's so much harder to move and it's just harder when you can bench one 50 all

3264
02:55:22.221 --> 02:55:26.720
day.
Yeah.
How often can you bench to 75 exactly.
Not a lot.

3265
02:55:26.721 --> 02:55:29.600
Not even Brock Lesnar can do that.
Like it's flyway.
Exactly.

3266
02:55:29.630 --> 02:55:32.750
And it's also like to find a guy who's a heavyweight,

3267
02:55:32.810 --> 02:55:34.970
like Muhammad Ali who would move like that.

3268
02:55:35.210 --> 02:55:37.550
That's one of the reasons why he was such an outlier.

3269
02:55:37.730 --> 02:55:39.230
Like nobody had ever seen a heavyweight.

3270
02:55:39.231 --> 02:55:42.200
They could dance like that and move around like that and like no one had

3271
02:55:42.201 --> 02:55:42.981
prepared for it.

3272
02:55:42.981 --> 02:55:46.880
Like Sonny Liston was like this plotting murderous puncher and really had no

3273
02:55:46.881 --> 02:55:49.790
answer for that stuff.
Right.
Because it's not supposed to exist.

3274
02:55:49.791 --> 02:55:53.960
Like a guy's not supposed to be that heavy and be able to move that good.
Yeah,

3275
02:55:54.170 --> 02:55:58.100
it's a lot harder.
But even him,
when he got older,
that shit went away too.

3276
02:55:58.250 --> 02:56:02.300
And the only thing that I really disagree with you on is a wonderful relievers.

3277
02:56:02.330 --> 02:56:03.170
You said what?

3278
02:56:03.200 --> 02:56:05.290
George St Pierre was a national treasury about to cross some lines,

3279
02:56:05.291 --> 02:56:07.820
said that he got out while the wolves are at the door.
Disagree.
My friend,

3280
02:56:08.540 --> 02:56:10.850
well he don't think he got out where the wolves are at the door.
Look,

3281
02:56:10.851 --> 02:56:13.820
I think George Saint Pierre has Johnny Henry hazing.
Well,

3282
02:56:13.910 --> 02:56:16.610
it's not just Johnny Hendricks.
He asked.
It's Robbie Lawler.

3283
02:56:16.611 --> 02:56:18.410
There's a lot of fucking really good fighters.

3284
02:56:18.590 --> 02:56:20.160
Robbie Lawler's lights in strike force.

3285
02:56:20.420 --> 02:56:23.420
It's not like he 85 he's fighting when he,
you know,
because people take,

3286
02:56:23.421 --> 02:56:24.950
it came down to all these fighters.

3287
02:56:24.951 --> 02:56:29.030
It's a lot of weight give up when you're at an elite level and he really wasn't

3288
02:56:29.031 --> 02:56:33.410
a 185 pound guy.
He's not even a big one.
70 he makes weight easily.

3289
02:56:33.620 --> 02:56:35.810
Whereas opposed to like Johnny Hendricks can even fucking make the weight

3290
02:56:35.811 --> 02:56:36.081
anymore.

3291
02:56:36.081 --> 02:56:38.510
They're going to make him go up to one 85 well that's a good friend of mine.

3292
02:56:38.511 --> 02:56:41.960
He talked about how law,
they would just come in,
barely warm up and just fight.

3293
02:56:41.961 --> 02:56:45.680
That was an animal.
He's not like a,
he's not methodical like George Saint Pierre.

3294
02:56:45.750 --> 02:56:47.150
No,
George,

3295
02:56:47.180 --> 02:56:50.990
I'd like his style better because George has style is so unpredictable and I

3296
02:56:50.991 --> 02:56:54.680
think that he really set the groundwork for,
for Assa hobbies or wizard.

3297
02:56:54.681 --> 02:56:59.660
He's one of the very best trainers in the world and for us has like brilliant

3298
02:56:59.661 --> 02:57:03.140
breakdowns of MMA and brilliant breakdowns of fights.

3299
02:57:03.141 --> 02:57:05.510
And when you talked to him about it and when he talks about training,

3300
02:57:05.810 --> 02:57:10.810
he talks about overloading guys' mind with possibilities and that's what George

3301
02:57:10.851 --> 02:57:12.440
did.
You never knew what the fuck he was going to do.

3302
02:57:12.470 --> 02:57:14.750
You know why he's wrestling is so good.
A lot people don't understand this.

3303
02:57:14.751 --> 02:57:16.070
There is no wrestling in Canada.

3304
02:57:16.160 --> 02:57:19.130
Well he trained his Russian nationals training question handles in the Canadian

3305
02:57:19.131 --> 02:57:22.190
Olympic team so it's not like we have some guy in the UFC who had some high

3306
02:57:22.191 --> 02:57:23.420
school wrestling experience.

3307
02:57:23.510 --> 02:57:27.380
Either you don't wrestle or you wrestle with the best in the entire country.

3308
02:57:27.440 --> 02:57:29.290
We saw so super open minded.

3309
02:57:29.480 --> 02:57:33.380
I did a little bit of training with George and he just listens to everything and

3310
02:57:33.381 --> 02:57:36.710
soaks it all in and you could see his mind working like a fucking computer.

3311
02:57:36.711 --> 02:57:40.850
The way he takes in technique and I,
you know,
we did a lot of work with John,

3312
02:57:40.851 --> 02:57:44.720
Donna her on his Jujitsu and he just seeks out people that are going to like

3313
02:57:44.721 --> 02:57:47.840
find little things that he can do better and he listens.

3314
02:57:47.841 --> 02:57:51.080
He doesn't have an ego about it at all.
That's because you don't know why.
Well,

3315
02:57:51.290 --> 02:57:54.090
I was dark.
It is inside that dark inside of my head.

3316
02:57:54.100 --> 02:57:58.460
The alien in see him come to get occasionally.
We got to get out of here.

3317
02:57:58.490 --> 02:58:01.070
This is where at a time,
we're three,
three hours in.
There's a lot of fun,
man.

3318
02:58:01.210 --> 02:58:04.180
You very much.
If you're in town,
we'll do it again.
For sure.
What happened?
Uh,

3319
02:58:04.440 --> 02:58:07.320
s Crowder on a,
on Twitter,
right?
Yeah.
Uh,

3320
02:58:07.350 --> 02:58:12.000
your youtube page or site is loaded with credit.
Knocked louder with Crowder 15.

3321
02:58:12.540 --> 02:58:15.150
All right.
Your Fox.
I'll see you soon.
Thanks everybody.
Bye.

3322
02:58:26.090 --> 02:58:26.160
<v 2>Okay.</v>
