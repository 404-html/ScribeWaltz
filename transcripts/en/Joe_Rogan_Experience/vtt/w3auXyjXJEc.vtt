00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:07.353
<v Speaker 1>This is what it is.</v>

2
00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.570
<v Speaker 1>Good friend Bert is a fucking raging alcoholic.</v>

3
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.330
<v Speaker 1>He drinks six doubles a night.</v>

4
00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:13.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5
00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.130
<v Speaker 1>he's during a 12 drinks a night.</v>

6
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.260
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you that in all honesty.</v>

7
00:00:17.261 --> 00:00:18.094
<v Speaker 1>Once again,</v>

8
00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.761
<v Speaker 1>so we said,</v>

9
00:00:18.761 --> 00:00:20.230
<v Speaker 1>do you think you'd get to where he said yes.</v>

10
00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.771
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

11
00:00:20.771 --> 00:00:22.780
<v Speaker 1>so then someone said sober and run a marathon.</v>

12
00:00:22.781 --> 00:00:23.141
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

13
00:00:23.141 --> 00:00:24.070
<v Speaker 1>stop you guys.</v>

14
00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.970
<v Speaker 1>He's going to die.</v>

15
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.350
<v Speaker 1>I have a problem with teetotaling when I worked with him in Milwaukee,</v>

16
00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:30.310
<v Speaker 1>Hawaii,</v>

17
00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.143
<v Speaker 1>Miami.</v>

18
00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.440
<v Speaker 1>So we said,</v>

19
00:00:32.441 --> 00:00:33.040
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

20
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.040
<v Speaker 1>how about no drinking for the entire month of October and you got to do 15 hot</v>

21

<v Speaker 1>yoga classes in a month.</v>

22
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.710
<v Speaker 1>Let's just,</v>

23
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.280
<v Speaker 1>let's just put the parameters down and then just pretend you think I'm not lying</v>

24
00:00:45.281 --> 00:00:45.820
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

25
00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.970
<v Speaker 1>So everybody agreed to that and then a couple of fucking days ago they started</v>

26
00:00:48.971 --> 00:00:49.540
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
