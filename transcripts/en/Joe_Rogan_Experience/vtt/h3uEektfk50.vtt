00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.850
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.530
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it amazing that we even have what's legal and what's not legal?</v>

3
00:00:07.531 --> 00:00:07.771
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4
00:00:07.771 --> 00:00:08.550
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>

5
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:09.480
<v Speaker 1>Wrote it down on paper.</v>

6
00:00:09.481 --> 00:00:10.230
<v Speaker 1>We all agreed.</v>

7
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean thinking about the shit that isn't isn't illegal and the fact that war is</v>

8
00:00:13.771 --> 00:00:14.670
<v Speaker 1>on that list at all.</v>

9
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:15.590
<v Speaker 1>I had like laws.</v>

10
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.470
<v Speaker 1>Do you like what wants you can't beat the shit out of him.</v>

11
00:00:19.471 --> 00:00:20.304
<v Speaker 1>He</v>

12
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.160
<v Speaker 1>can't come into my house to take my stuff.</v>

13
00:00:23.161 --> 00:00:23.994
<v Speaker 1>What am I going to do?</v>

14
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.680
<v Speaker 1>What am I honestly going to do about it?</v>

15
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.030
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about that when I was watching the UFC this past weekend.</v>

16
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.260
<v Speaker 1>I was watching this,</v>

17
00:00:31.261 --> 00:00:36.261
<v Speaker 1>a frightful beating that Alexander Gustafson put on glover to share and it was</v>

18
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.130
<v Speaker 1>just a ruthless knockout,</v>

19
00:00:38.131 --> 00:00:42.060
<v Speaker 1>just fucking vicious beat down and then eventually stopped him and I was</v>

20
00:00:42.061 --> 00:00:42.301
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>

21
00:00:42.301 --> 00:00:45.360
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of crazy that these guys agree to do this.</v>

22
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:46.590
<v Speaker 1>They agree to do this.</v>

23
00:00:46.591 --> 00:00:49.200
<v Speaker 1>Everybody signs away and then you go do something that anywhere else in the</v>

24
00:00:49.201 --> 00:00:50.880
<v Speaker 1>world you would get locked down for.</v>

25
00:00:50.881 --> 00:00:55.290
<v Speaker 1>The rest of that happens in hockey every once in awhile where somebody goes too</v>

26
00:00:55.291 --> 00:00:57.930
<v Speaker 1>far and then the government gets involved.</v>

27
00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:58.590
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

28
00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

29
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.250
<v Speaker 1>Like what do they do if you hit somebody in the head with a stick goes outside</v>

30
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.990
<v Speaker 1>the boundaries of a setting.</v>

31
00:01:06.991 --> 00:01:07.740
<v Speaker 1>The tone.</v>

32
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.060
<v Speaker 1>That seems like a pussy move though.</v>

33
00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.350
<v Speaker 1>Hit Him with a stick.</v>

34
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.180
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to punch.</v>

35
00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.730
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

36
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.220
<v Speaker 1>it's so weird when you got this stick in your hand.</v>

37
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:16.540
<v Speaker 1>You know it,</v>

38
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.170
<v Speaker 1>it just the shit that you sometimes think of doing.</v>

39
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.720
<v Speaker 1>I would bury each other and the balls.</v>

40
00:01:21.721 --> 00:01:23.000
<v Speaker 1>They fucking whack at the bay.</v>

41
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.620
<v Speaker 1>There's no padding behind your legs.</v>

42
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.490
<v Speaker 1>Just imagine that just taken up would stick it just ah,</v>

43
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.310
<v Speaker 1>with NHL level strength and just given someone a two hander the backlight,</v>

44
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.620
<v Speaker 1>they break people's finger.</v>

45
00:01:32.621 --> 00:01:34.590
<v Speaker 1>Crosby almost took somebody's finger off this year.</v>

46
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.960
<v Speaker 1>If they get too far,</v>

47
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:36.320
<v Speaker 1>like if the.</v>

48
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.290
<v Speaker 1>If it gets really.</v>

49
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.030
<v Speaker 1>If they just opened the rules up a little bit.</v>

50
00:01:39.031 --> 00:01:39.721
<v Speaker 1>You know what's gonna Happen?</v>

51
00:01:39.721 --> 00:01:39.931
<v Speaker 1>They're gonna.</v>

52
00:01:39.931 --> 00:01:42.840
<v Speaker 1>Bring in figure skaters and they going to teach them taekwondo.</v>

53
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to cut people's fucking heads off with the skates.</v>

54
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.871
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

55
00:01:48.871 --> 00:01:50.230
<v Speaker 1>You're spinning elk man.</v>

56
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.480
<v Speaker 1>If you ever learned how to skate,</v>

57
00:01:51.481 --> 00:01:52.620
<v Speaker 1>you'd be fucking dangerous.</v>

58
00:01:52.621 --> 00:01:53.970
<v Speaker 1>If you have a did that with skates on,</v>

59
00:01:53.971 --> 00:01:54.571
<v Speaker 1>that would be it.</v>

60
00:01:54.571 --> 00:01:55.171
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>

61
00:01:55.171 --> 00:01:56.400
<v Speaker 1>If you teach that to somebody,</v>

62
00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.500
<v Speaker 1>teach that to somebody with skates.</v>

63
00:01:58.501 --> 00:02:00.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you could hit someone with a hockey stick,</v>

64
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.970
<v Speaker 1>why can't you hit them with skate?</v>

65
00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.270
<v Speaker 1>Like where were you on the line?</v>

66
00:02:03.271 --> 00:02:04.860
<v Speaker 1>He can't hit them with this that they do it.</v>

67
00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.010
<v Speaker 1>Somebody does it to you.</v>

68
00:02:06.011 --> 00:02:07.860
<v Speaker 1>I know they slashed and they do stuff like that.</v>

69
00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:09.240
<v Speaker 1>You can't club somebody over.</v>

70
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean even slashing so.</v>

71
00:02:10.951 --> 00:02:11.281
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

72
00:02:11.281 --> 00:02:12.840
<v Speaker 1>I'll just slash your leg out.</v>

73
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.153
<v Speaker 1>What would you rather have?</v>

74
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.550
<v Speaker 1>Would you rather have ticket get hit by a piece of wood and you don't have a</v>

75
00:02:17.551 --> 00:02:19.980
<v Speaker 1>bruise there or have somebody slash you with escape?</v>

76
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.050
<v Speaker 1>I would absolutely rather get hit by the piece of wood,</v>

77
00:02:22.051 --> 00:02:23.610
<v Speaker 1>but I shouldn't get hit by the piece of wood.</v>

78
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

79
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't play hockey,</v>

80
00:02:24.931 --> 00:02:26.970
<v Speaker 1>but if I did play hockey I'd be pretty pissed.</v>

81
00:02:26.971 --> 00:02:27.990
<v Speaker 1>If somebody hit me with a stick,</v>

82
00:02:27.991 --> 00:02:28.381
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

83
00:02:28.381 --> 00:02:30.210
<v Speaker 1>you fucking pussy and I'd want to hit.</v>

84
00:02:30.211 --> 00:02:34.380
<v Speaker 1>It became like the second coming of Thai Domi you have the exact same build.</v>

85
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.620
<v Speaker 1>He's a fucking guy who somehow was like my height and was considered a</v>

86
00:02:40.141 --> 00:02:44.700
<v Speaker 1>heavyweight fighter and he's the guy according to him,</v>

87
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.830
<v Speaker 1>he came up with the,</v>

88
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.780
<v Speaker 1>grab them by,</v>

89
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:49.350
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

90
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.160
<v Speaker 1>right underneath your collar and then turn all the way sideways because he</v>

91
00:02:53.161 --> 00:02:54.600
<v Speaker 1>didn't have the reach advantage.</v>

92
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:55.483
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

93
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.221
<v Speaker 1>And then he would,</v>

94
00:02:56.221 --> 00:02:59.560
<v Speaker 1>he would wait for them to throw he duck under and then come over the top.</v>

95
00:02:59.561 --> 00:03:00.041
<v Speaker 1>And Dude,</v>

96
00:03:00.041 --> 00:03:00.360
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

97
00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.290
<v Speaker 1>I met him one time,</v>

98
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:03.460
<v Speaker 1>great fucking guy.</v>

99
00:03:03.461 --> 00:03:03.850
<v Speaker 1>And he,</v>

100
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.100
<v Speaker 1>he's got these as like your hands use your hands.</v>

101
00:03:06.101 --> 00:03:06.641
<v Speaker 1>You make like that.</v>

102
00:03:06.641 --> 00:03:07.510
<v Speaker 1>It turns into a hammer.</v>

103
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:08.261
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing.</v>

104
00:03:08.261 --> 00:03:13.261
<v Speaker 1>He has like these inexplicably like bare fucking pause and I might be a little</v>

105
00:03:14.711 --> 00:03:15.544
<v Speaker 1>taller than him.</v>

106
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.110
<v Speaker 1>And I remember when he's tried to show me when he grabbed the front of my shirt</v>

107
00:03:20.111 --> 00:03:20.890
<v Speaker 1>to show me,</v>

108
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:21.131
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

109
00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:22.390
<v Speaker 1>I literally felt like an adrenaline,</v>

110
00:03:22.391 --> 00:03:23.500
<v Speaker 1>like a flashback.</v>

111
00:03:23.501 --> 00:03:24.670
<v Speaker 1>I hope this guy doesn't snap.</v>

112
00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.990
<v Speaker 1>Now he's one of the,</v>

113
00:03:25.991 --> 00:03:26.260
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

114
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.620
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

115
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.060
<v Speaker 1>he's one of the toughest guys that ever you ever played?</v>

116
00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.550
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

117
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.650
<v Speaker 1>there's some girls in Portland that had taken a rash of shit because they're</v>

118
00:03:34.651 --> 00:03:36.210
<v Speaker 1>selling burritos and they're white.</v>

119
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.770
<v Speaker 1>They made a burrito truck and people are going crazy trying to shut them down,</v>

120
00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.720
<v Speaker 1>shut them down because they're not Mexican and they're selling burritos like</v>

121
00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:47.483
<v Speaker 1>they're not.</v>

122
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.260
<v Speaker 1>They're not pretending.</v>

123
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.600
<v Speaker 1>They're not like putting shoe Polish on and pretending.</v>

124
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.000
<v Speaker 1>And I put in Brown face on there just fucking selling burritos.</v>

125
00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.180
<v Speaker 1>Like it's so crazy.</v>

126
00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.000
<v Speaker 1>Critics close,</v>

127
00:04:00.001 --> 00:04:02.970
<v Speaker 1>white women's Portland Burrito stand for cultural theft.</v>

128
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.050
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck man?</v>

129
00:04:04.051 --> 00:04:07.270
<v Speaker 1>Their burritos assholes next against.</v>

130
00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.620
<v Speaker 1>Don't even even free to just.</v>

131
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:09.473
<v Speaker 1>They do.</v>

132
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.160
<v Speaker 1>You mentioned a Mexican expert Burritos A.</v>

133
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.120
<v Speaker 1>I've eaten Burritos in Mexico.</v>

134
00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:16.403
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

135
00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.130
<v Speaker 1>I have had a real chicken burrito in Mexico and was quite delicious.</v>

136
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.993
<v Speaker 1>I love Mexico.</v>

137
00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.320
<v Speaker 1>I just don't understand why anybody thinks that there's something wrong with</v>

138
00:04:25.321 --> 00:04:27.270
<v Speaker 1>learning a style of cooking.</v>

139
00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:28.260
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

140
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.330
<v Speaker 1>I think if you have cultural appropriation,</v>

141
00:04:30.331 --> 00:04:35.100
<v Speaker 1>if you have like a person who's pretending they're from Laos and they start</v>

142
00:04:35.101 --> 00:04:37.560
<v Speaker 1>talking with the fake accent and you know,</v>

143
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.251
<v Speaker 1>and you go,</v>

144
00:04:38.251 --> 00:04:38.940
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

145
00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.320
<v Speaker 1>you're full fucking Cleveland.</v>

146
00:04:40.321 --> 00:04:41.154
<v Speaker 1>You're not even.</v>

147
00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.240
<v Speaker 1>You're not even have Laos to scent like you do at 23 and me on you and you find</v>

148
00:04:45.241 --> 00:04:46.710
<v Speaker 1>out like your family is from Finland,</v>

149
00:04:46.711 --> 00:04:48.030
<v Speaker 1>like the fuck is wrong with you.</v>

150
00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.420
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

151
00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.910
<v Speaker 1>but there are people that do that and that is crazy.</v>

152
00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:51.690
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

153
00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.070
<v Speaker 1>But that's just deceptive.</v>

154
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:54.400
<v Speaker 1>This is not deceptive.</v>

155
00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.100
<v Speaker 1>Someone who likes making Burritos,</v>

156
00:04:56.101 --> 00:04:59.670
<v Speaker 1>they're making burritos and then these goofy white kids are fucking closing them</v>

157
00:04:59.671 --> 00:05:00.420
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

158
00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:01.530
<v Speaker 1>And that's what it is.</v>

159
00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.270
<v Speaker 1>Cultural Appropriation,</v>

160
00:05:03.271 --> 00:05:06.810
<v Speaker 1>heroes just shouting out from the rooftop that you're wrong,</v>

161
00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.921
<v Speaker 1>you're wrong.</v>

162
00:05:07.921 --> 00:05:08.551
<v Speaker 1>It's like you said,</v>

163
00:05:08.551 --> 00:05:10.590
<v Speaker 1>we're just always looking for who to blame,</v>

164
00:05:10.591 --> 00:05:11.550
<v Speaker 1>who to be mad at,</v>

165
00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.530
<v Speaker 1>who to make sort of the,</v>

166
00:05:13.531 --> 00:05:16.200
<v Speaker 1>the persecutor of our felt wrongness.</v>

167
00:05:16.201 --> 00:05:17.370
<v Speaker 1>It's that same issue.</v>

168
00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.013
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

169
00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.170
<v Speaker 1>We premiered last night and it will air this Sunday.</v>

170
00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.920
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

171
00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.540
<v Speaker 1>Jim Carey said some amazing things,</v>

172
00:05:24.541 --> 00:05:25.320
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

173
00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.501
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

174
00:05:25.501 --> 00:05:26.400
<v Speaker 1>That's our cast photo.</v>

175
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:27.510
<v Speaker 1>That one that you clicked that one.</v>

176
00:05:27.511 --> 00:05:28.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

177
00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:29.840
<v Speaker 1>Did it feel weird to beyond that?</v>

178
00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:30.201
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

179
00:05:30.201 --> 00:05:31.190
<v Speaker 1>it must have been like,</v>

180
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.700
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you from the bottom of my heart,</v>

181
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.080
<v Speaker 1>it was the most important thing I've done so far.</v>

182
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:38.003
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

183
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.341
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

184
00:05:38.341 --> 00:05:38.581
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

185
00:05:38.581 --> 00:05:40.960
<v Speaker 1>we're paying homage to the world that,</v>

186
00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.240
<v Speaker 1>that we love and respect so much and it was a big effort on Jim's part and his</v>

187
00:05:45.241 --> 00:05:45.781
<v Speaker 1>producing partner,</v>

188
00:05:45.781 --> 00:05:47.310
<v Speaker 1>Michael Aguilar to like tell real stories.</v>

189
00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.800
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the stories that people will see if you watch the show and I hope you</v>

190
00:05:49.801 --> 00:05:52.860
<v Speaker 1>do come from Jim's real life to dudes from Boston moved.</v>

191
00:05:52.861 --> 00:05:55.650
<v Speaker 1>They live in a fucking dude's closet in West Hollywood and they used to be a guy</v>

192
00:05:55.651 --> 00:05:58.110
<v Speaker 1>that would jerk off and watched him change him,</v>

193
00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.300
<v Speaker 1>put that story in the show man.</v>

194
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:01.750
<v Speaker 1>He wanted all these little great tidbits.</v>

195
00:06:01.751 --> 00:06:04.890
<v Speaker 1>There's a great moment about jokes dealing in there and a fucking huge fist</v>

196
00:06:04.891 --> 00:06:05.571
<v Speaker 1>fight that breaks out.</v>

197
00:06:05.571 --> 00:06:09.470
<v Speaker 1>That was real from Jim's personal life about guys who used to come in from the</v>

198
00:06:09.471 --> 00:06:10.101
<v Speaker 1>fucking radio,</v>

199
00:06:10.101 --> 00:06:11.900
<v Speaker 1>from talk radio in the morning.</v>

200
00:06:11.901 --> 00:06:12.950
<v Speaker 1>They come to the club at night,</v>

201
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.903
<v Speaker 1>come to the store,</v>

202
00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:14.600
<v Speaker 1>steal shit.</v>

203
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.220
<v Speaker 1>The next morning comics would fucking hear it.</v>

204
00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.791
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

205
00:06:16.791 --> 00:06:19.700
<v Speaker 1>That's a real common thing and that was always going on.</v>

206
00:06:19.701 --> 00:06:20.660
<v Speaker 1>You know what else was going on?</v>

207
00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:25.690
<v Speaker 1>A big one was a writers for sitcoms would come same shit and they would watch</v>

208
00:06:25.821 --> 00:06:28.320
<v Speaker 1>people do sets and then they would wind up putting their,</v>

209
00:06:28.321 --> 00:06:31.420
<v Speaker 1>their bits and like even on fucking Seinfeld kept wanting.</v>

210
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:35.810
<v Speaker 1>Kevin James Signature bits got used on Seinfeld after he had a bunch of meetings</v>

211
00:06:35.811 --> 00:06:37.580
<v Speaker 1>and then they came to see him perform.</v>

212
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.930
<v Speaker 1>A bunch of top writers came to see him performing and NBC showcase.</v>

213
00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:46.040
<v Speaker 1>It was only when Kevin was getting a development deal and they came down and</v>

214
00:06:46.041 --> 00:06:50.420
<v Speaker 1>watched him and then like the next season his muffin bit was on a Seinfeld</v>

215
00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:51.290
<v Speaker 1>episode.</v>

216
00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:51.831
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

217
00:06:51.831 --> 00:06:53.120
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck man?</v>

218
00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:54.230
<v Speaker 1>Well nowadays they fucking.</v>

219
00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:55.310
<v Speaker 1>They're blatantly tell you,</v>

220
00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:58.550
<v Speaker 1>like I tested for Saturday night live and you sign a form that says these</v>

221
00:06:58.551 --> 00:07:01.550
<v Speaker 1>characters can be used after the audition.</v>

222
00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:03.030
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

223
00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:03.741
<v Speaker 1>and this is crazy.</v>

224
00:07:03.741 --> 00:07:05.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm not calling out anybody or saying anything,</v>

225
00:07:05.841 --> 00:07:06.260
<v Speaker 1>but they did.</v>

226
00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.380
<v Speaker 1>There was a character ended up on the show that Vanessa Bayer did fucking</v>

227
00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:10.071
<v Speaker 1>hilariously,</v>

228
00:07:10.071 --> 00:07:11.570
<v Speaker 1>that I did something similar in my audition.</v>

229
00:07:11.571 --> 00:07:11.841
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

230
00:07:11.841 --> 00:07:12.081
<v Speaker 1>damn,</v>

231
00:07:12.081 --> 00:07:12.810
<v Speaker 1>that was really good.</v>

232
00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:13.490
<v Speaker 1>It's me.</v>

233
00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:14.050

239
00:07:17.871 --> 00:07:18.790
<v Speaker 1>They can steal that.</v>

240
00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:19.663
<v Speaker 1>They own that now.</v>

241
00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:20.510
<v Speaker 1>Cause you audition,</v>

242
00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:21.021
<v Speaker 1>you audition,</v>

243
00:07:21.021 --> 00:07:22.010

244
00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:23.090
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you man.</v>

245
00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:23.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

246
00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.110
<v Speaker 1>you sign a piece of paper,</v>

247
00:07:24.111 --> 00:07:24.251
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

248
00:07:24.251 --> 00:07:28.010
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy to not even giving you money and they're stealing your idea when you</v>

249
00:07:28.011 --> 00:07:28.844
<v Speaker 1>get there.</v>

250
00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:30.380
<v Speaker 1>That's the respect that,</v>

251
00:07:30.381 --> 00:07:31.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

252
00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:32.870
<v Speaker 1>the SNL has earned in the community.</v>

253
00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:33.540
<v Speaker 1>You don't,</v>

254
00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:35.000
<v Speaker 1>you don't have that respect.</v>

255
00:07:35.001 --> 00:07:36.260
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy that stealing.</v>

256
00:07:36.261 --> 00:07:37.950
<v Speaker 1>You're stealing while I signed the form,</v>

257
00:07:37.951 --> 00:07:38.570
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

258
00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:39.403
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

259
00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:40.430
<v Speaker 1>that's so awful.</v>

260
00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:41.680
<v Speaker 1>I signed that shit because of the.</v>

261
00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:42.980
<v Speaker 1>Because you can almost taste it,</v>

262
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:43.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

263
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.190
<v Speaker 1>they're making you sign something saying we're going to steal from you.</v>

264
00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:46.880
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>

265
00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.820
<v Speaker 1>So there was an instance where a faculty member,</v>

266
00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:55.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm accused those that were challenging any of these equity proposals as being</v>

267
00:07:55.521 --> 00:07:57.140
<v Speaker 1>part of a racist backlash.</v>

268
00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.140
<v Speaker 1>And she was clearly talking about me because I'm the most,</v>

269
00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:00.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

270
00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:04.250
<v Speaker 1>the most prominent a person objects as faculty member,</v>

271
00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:05.260
<v Speaker 1>a white person or no.</v>

272
00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:06.883
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

273
00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:07.341
<v Speaker 1>so anyway,</v>

274
00:08:07.341 --> 00:08:09.230
<v Speaker 1>she says in a faculty meeting that,</v>

275
00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:09.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

276
00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:10.850
<v Speaker 1>this is a racist backlash.</v>

277
00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:14.150
<v Speaker 1>And I said to her in front of this faculty meeting,</v>

278
00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:14.870
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

279
00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:18.350
<v Speaker 1>somebody might want to check on the question of whether or not I'm actually a</v>

280
00:08:18.351 --> 00:08:18.801
<v Speaker 1>racist,</v>

281
00:08:18.801 --> 00:08:20.960
<v Speaker 1>because if you do check on it,</v>

282
00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:21.650
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

283
00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:22.880
<v Speaker 1>you will discover I'm not,</v>

284
00:08:22.881 --> 00:08:23.571
<v Speaker 1>and if you don't,</v>

285
00:08:23.571 --> 00:08:24.920
<v Speaker 1>this is going to blow up on you.</v>

286
00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:30.610
<v Speaker 1>And the chair of the Faculty told me that the faculty meeting was not the place</v>

287
00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:34.250
<v Speaker 1>to defend myself against accusations of racism.</v>

288
00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:35.420
<v Speaker 1>I said to her,</v>

289
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:36.800
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>

290
00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:41.060
<v Speaker 1>Where is not the place to level to level the accusations.</v>

291
00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:41.661
<v Speaker 1>But I said,</v>

292
00:08:41.661 --> 00:08:42.620
<v Speaker 1>where is the place?</v>

293
00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:46.010
<v Speaker 1>And then the faculty member who had made the accusation said,</v>

294
00:08:46.011 --> 00:08:49.280
<v Speaker 1>you should not expect there to be a venue in which to defend yourself.</v>

295
00:08:49.281 --> 00:08:51.800
<v Speaker 1>You should just get used to these accusations.</v>

296
00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:52.970
<v Speaker 1>In a separate case.</v>

297
00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:56.320
<v Speaker 1>I was telling who said that a white guy or oh,</v>

298
00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:58.170
<v Speaker 1>it's the same faculty member who made the accusation,</v>

299
00:08:58.171 --> 00:08:59.040
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

300
00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:04.910
<v Speaker 1>the person said that you should just accept these untrue accusations.</v>

301
00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:06.773
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

302
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:07.823
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

303
00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:08.160
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

304
00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:08.321
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

305
00:09:08.321 --> 00:09:09.300
<v Speaker 1>what's your reaction to that?</v>

306
00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:12.810
<v Speaker 1>That this is not a place for you to defend yourself against racist accusations.</v>

307
00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:14.850
<v Speaker 1>This is a place for you to just eat shit,</v>

308
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:15.180
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

309
00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:17.730
<v Speaker 1>You just have to accept these accusations on a separate occasion.</v>

310
00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:19.590
<v Speaker 1>We were also told that,</v>

311
00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:20.513
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

312
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.560
<v Speaker 1>that to question,</v>

313
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:23.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

314
00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:25.740
<v Speaker 1>an allegation of racism is racist.</v>

315
00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:26.700
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

316
00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:27.481
<v Speaker 1>so convenient.</v>

317
00:09:27.481 --> 00:09:27.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

318
00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:29.100
<v Speaker 1>We'll try to wrap your mind around that.</v>

319
00:09:29.101 --> 00:09:33.600
<v Speaker 1>One question and accusation of racism is racist,</v>

320
00:09:33.601 --> 00:09:33.780
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

321
00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:35.040
<v Speaker 1>We have an obligation to believe.</v>

322
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.750
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

323
00:09:36.751 --> 00:09:37.620
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
