1
00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.123
Okay.

2
00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:08.943
Yeah.

3
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.650
<v 1>Good experience.</v>

4
00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.910
<v 0>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

5
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.610
<v 1>I never knew.
I never do.
Sorry.</v>

6
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.800
I don't hear anything Brian.
You don't hear anything?
Oh yeah,
my self at all.

7
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.750
Hello?
Do we have technical issues?
I don't hear myself either.
Yeah,

8
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.870
I hear you guys.
Yeah,
we hear you,
dude.
We hear you.
But we don't hear ourselves.

9
00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.210
You just did something.
You turning it out.
Hello?
What'd you just do?
Hello?
Stan.

10
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.000
Oh,
not too.
Why?
Look at that first cause no one uses it.
She plays with that,

11
00:01:17.001 --> 00:01:21.560
right dude,
the cats.
The cats get in here and start whacking shit around.
Yeah.

12
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.690
Tell me when it's good.
They don't like it when we kick them out.

13
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.990
I can't hear me at all.
Can you hear me?
I can hear you.

14
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.030
You're probably using the wrong headphones.
Is there another period?

15
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.110
What am I talking to that man talking about?
Can you hear me right now?

16
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.390
Not very well.
Try it again right now.
Right now.
Hello?

17
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.420
Yeah,
I can't,
I can't really hear.
I can hear me a little bit,

18
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.810
which is right here.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
Now I hear,
yeah.
Oh my God.

19
00:01:44.811 --> 00:01:47.570
It extracts the,
yeah,
I think we were supposed to be on this one.

20
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.260
We don't know what the fuck we're doing or a new desk and I'm very excited,

21
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.660
but I'm also very excited per Chrysler was in the motherfucking house.

22
00:01:53.661 --> 00:01:55.280
Ladies and gentlemen,
give it up for Bert.

23
00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:59.800
Kreischer the first like real fan of the show to come on the show.
Um,
I can't,

24
00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.390
I don't know.
Sort of know,
you know,
because I listened to,

25
00:02:02.391 --> 00:02:04.700
I listened to every single one.
Oh,
well thanks man.
That's awesome.

26
00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.510
That's the best way people,
anyone I saw on a chat board,
someone's like,
there's,

27
00:02:08.511 --> 00:02:09.344
you'll only be an hour.

28
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.160
I couldn't use them for four hours while some people like it if it's only an

29
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.970
hour,
but then just listen to an hour.
If I shut it off,
I like the long flight.

30
00:02:16.971 --> 00:02:19.800
I'm flying to Miami,
I'm going to pass out in the middle and have to rewind them.

31
00:02:19.801 --> 00:02:22.880
Figure out how the fuck a monkey can hold.

32
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.640
How does everyone on the show so fucking smart.

33
00:02:25.641 --> 00:02:30.330
I never thought Ralphie was that smart.
Like just hanging out with them.
You know,

34
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.570
if you've got to put up that kind of that much material.
We,

35
00:02:32.571 --> 00:02:35.750
Ralphie May's got hours and hours.
His Shit.
You know a guy like that.

36
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.870
You gotta be intelligent.
You got to be intelligent to be a comic.
Yeah.

37
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.530
Some people are smart as shit.
What is going on with the sound,
Brian?
Echoing.

38
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.640
It's really loud.
Yeah.
Hello.

39
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.190
I need to be closer.
This,
this is all very different than yesterday.

40
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.050
We're crusher.
He's a fucking robot.
Yeah.

41
00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.770
His voice doesn't work like normal human voices.
Huh?
We good now?
I think so.

42
00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.380
Okay.
Maybe were stoned.
Yeah,
that's definitely the case.

43
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.110
It's the vaporizer gives you a different hospital,
different,

44
00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.720
little more intense going vaporizer lately ladies and gentlemen,

45
00:03:07.721 --> 00:03:11.660
cutting out the middle man,
concentrate to the THC.
Um,
you know,
the,

46
00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.950
the conversations we have,
that's one of the most fun things about it.
I mean,

47
00:03:14.951 --> 00:03:17.440
we always have these conversations like,
especially Dunkin and I,
we,

48
00:03:17.441 --> 00:03:21.470
we would have hours and hours of super bake conversation.
Brian Count Too.

49
00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.110
I fell in love with Dunkin and saw him on a plane and went back to where he was

50
00:03:26.111 --> 00:03:29.090
sitting and could not stop talking to him about getting back into weed.

51
00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.500
Oh really?
Really trying to get back into weed.
It's just,
I don't,

52
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.040
it's not like you're trying to take yoga.

53
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.550
My wife and my sisters had an intervention and they were like this and you're

54
00:03:36.551 --> 00:03:39.160
drinking way too much.
And I was like,
okay.
And they're like,

55
00:03:39.161 --> 00:03:43.000
we got you a bag of Afghany Kush,
like start there.

56
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.410
And then I did and I got rookie bait like that happened to me once.

57
00:03:47.411 --> 00:03:49.910
I got really scared ones because uh,
I'd,

58
00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:55.020
I'd gotten upset at myself for like making fun of Steven Seagal.
Is this,

59
00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.620
how high was,
I was so happy.
I called Eddie Bravo.
Okay.
I was super baked,

60
00:03:59.621 --> 00:04:03.430
paranoid and I'm like,
what am I going fight Stevens to golf?
I see him like,

61
00:04:03.431 --> 00:04:04.780
I don't even really care about it.
I'm like,

62
00:04:04.781 --> 00:04:06.910
why am I speaking so mean when I'm making fun of them?

63
00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.970
Cause I was making fun of him,
just,
we were relentlessly and brutally.

64
00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.150
And I thought about it while Super Beta was like,
what if I met that guy?

65
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.400
Two things.
First of all,
I'd probably would be nice to him,

66
00:04:15.401 --> 00:04:18.040
which is like the most hypocritical shit ever worse.
And second of all,

67
00:04:18.041 --> 00:04:22.360
I would probably feel terrible for like being so mean and making bad jokes.

68
00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.910
Fleshlight yeah.
Which box is so bad.
This is,
this is the alien one.

69
00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.380
This is,
you haven't come in.
No,
no one has.
No one has,
I know that.
That's a joke.

70
00:04:32.381 --> 00:04:35.080
He liked to play all friends.
That's Brian.
He doesn't,

71
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.520
he doesn't run these flashlights.
These are in my possession.
It's pretty awesome.

72
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.330
It's really good for shooting loads into,
oh my God.

73
00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:47.200
And if you go to Joe rogan.net and you click the link,
you put in a Rogan,

74
00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:51.190
you get 15% off the podcast or off the,
uh,
the flashlight.

75
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:52.990
Here's how you clean it.
Have you seen this part?

76
00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.720
Unscrew the bottom and just dump it out and pick the top and,

77
00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.970
but the faucet on the top right through,
that's it.

78
00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.180
I'm going to leave it in,
just leave the loads and the tenement magnet nom wow.

79
00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.670
Having like a real moment with my fleshlight conversation with their long day

80
00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.740
really long.
Speaking of Vietnam,

81
00:05:11.741 --> 00:05:14.270
I saw a really interesting documentary or a piece rather.

82
00:05:14.271 --> 00:05:15.730
It was a very short clip about a,

83
00:05:15.731 --> 00:05:20.410
they were talking about how marijuana it was changed war and how Vietnam was the

84
00:05:20.411 --> 00:05:23.860
first war where the soldiers were smoking marijuana and they became reluctant to

85
00:05:23.861 --> 00:05:27.670
fight and it was all about the mentality of the soldiers just completely changed

86
00:05:27.671 --> 00:05:30.580
when they're in Southeast Asia and they were smoking weed and they could smell

87
00:05:30.581 --> 00:05:33.340
the Viet cong smoking weed like over the hill.

88
00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.080
Like they were like close enough to each other's smell each other's we'd shut
up.

89
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:41.080
And one guy was talking about how there was one time where he was high and he

90
00:05:41.081 --> 00:05:43.200
had seen this Vietnamese,
uh,

91
00:05:43.201 --> 00:05:45.690
this Viet Cong soldier and he knew that that guy was high too.

92
00:05:45.691 --> 00:05:47.680
It's like they looked at each other and they knew they were high.

93
00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.250
He just started when they knew that I didn't even know each other and I'm going

94
00:05:51.251 --> 00:05:52.600
to shoot each other because you know,

95
00:05:52.601 --> 00:05:55.660
some fucking people in an office somewhere say that this is how it's supposed to

96
00:05:55.661 --> 00:05:56.140
go down.

97
00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:00.000
But those Vietnam guys were the first generation to hear stories about war.
Yeah.

98
00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:01.460
Cause their dads came back.

99
00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:04.940
My great grandfather came back from World War One world war two and was fucked

100
00:06:04.941 --> 00:06:08.300
up like fucked up.
Like,
and they didn't know that you could fix it.

101
00:06:08.301 --> 00:06:10.220
They just thought,
well that's what happened to my life.

102
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.190
I was 18 and it just switched and I'll drink beer in the garage by myself.

103
00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.890
Well they don't know what to fix it with.
Even though what they're doing now,

104
00:06:15.891 --> 00:06:18.050
they're,
they're really taking the long way around.

105
00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:22.160
What they really should be doing is given,
given the soldiers,
the ones you know,

106
00:06:22.161 --> 00:06:25.050
that want to do something about post traumatic stress disorder,

107
00:06:25.051 --> 00:06:29.360
me shouldn't impose it on them,
but giving them Ibogaine.
I begin and,
um,

108
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:34.510
Iowasca are two of the most potent psychedelic mixtures and they're responsible

109
00:06:35.031 --> 00:06:39.860
for so many different people getting off of heroin,
getting overly fast.
Yes.

110
00:06:39.861 --> 00:06:42.150
That students like conversations with God,

111
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:44.360
that would be like the worst thing possible.

112
00:06:44.361 --> 00:06:47.660
That gives somebody never touch with reality.
You know,

113
00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.420
know what it does is it lets them know what really happened.

114
00:06:50.421 --> 00:06:53.990
It lets them see it from an emotional perspective why there's this big gigantic

115
00:06:53.991 --> 00:06:58.100
hole in them that that freaks out whenever they think about the past and freaks

116
00:06:58.101 --> 00:07:01.800
out and re relives all these moments.
And you can go over it with WWE,

117
00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:04.460
especially with Ibogaine.
I've heard so many different stories about,

118
00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:07.340
and also with the Mtma,
you know,
MDA,

119
00:07:07.341 --> 00:07:10.160
which is accuracy using therapy with that,

120
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.280
that was the idol on its drug when you didn't know what the fuck you up.

121
00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.370
Well it does fuck you up though.
That's why I won't do it.

122
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.700
I did it once and that was it for me and,
but I learned a lot,
man.
I,

123
00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:24.050
I learned a lot about like insecurities and,
but anyway,
the point is about,

124
00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.260
about soldiers like you know,
and people that are addicted,

125
00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:30.470
there's people that have like problems with heroin,
problems with alcohol.

126
00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:32.980
They can fix all that shit with Ibogaine.
But Geraldo,

127
00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:37.430
I said like when in one of his lowest points took a bunch of acid cause he said

128
00:07:37.431 --> 00:07:41.390
that he heard that that would fix his problems and he said it didn't,

129
00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:45.920
we'll acids not known for that.
I mean acid.
Well it is kind of self,
right?

130
00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:46.881
Yeah.

131
00:07:46.881 --> 00:07:51.340
But I think acid also just freaks people out so much at Mike when it wears out

132
00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:52.610
you off,
it's like,
so

133
00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:58.460
someone described it as abrasively introspective that just like so freaked you

134
00:07:58.461 --> 00:08:01.700
out that it might be too much for someone who has like an addiction.

135
00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:05.630
Now Mushrooms,
I think our lunchrooms are good.
Anything that's enlightening,

136
00:08:05.631 --> 00:08:08.070
anything that allows you to step back and look at.

137
00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:10.970
But it has to also jive with your biochemistry.

138
00:08:10.971 --> 00:08:12.590
You can say everything enlightening.

139
00:08:12.591 --> 00:08:15.530
But what if you're the one weirdo that's allergic to peanuts and you know he

140
00:08:15.531 --> 00:08:17.690
can't even drink diet coke or you get splitting headaches.

141
00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:20.220
Are there people that are allergic to we'd like physicians are,

142
00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.190
there must be people that are allergic to everything.

143
00:08:22.191 --> 00:08:25.310
I would think a lot of bronc like people that have like smoking allergies in

144
00:08:25.311 --> 00:08:26.950
general unit.
They,
yeah,

145
00:08:26.951 --> 00:08:29.700
but if that's the case or the allergic to have to the Eden there,
uh,

146
00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:31.010
what about vaporizing?

147
00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:35.690
It still has smoking and I don't care what it's missing.
Yeah,

148
00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:39.230
that's the whole deal.
You still cough from it?
I don't call from it.

149
00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:43.230
I my hop yesterday,
he coughed yesterday from it cause I remember going,
ah,

150
00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:45.800
you're going to be relief.
Fuck now.
No,
I think think so.
Brian,

151
00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:49.760
I think you're attaching that moment,
that memory to some other time.

152
00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:53.600
I didn't really Demitri Martin is allergic to alcohol.
Rarely.
Yeah.
And peanuts.

153
00:08:53.601 --> 00:08:56.070
Like if you thought I shouldn't say that,
that could be really mean and

154
00:08:56.250 --> 00:09:00.270
<v 2>throw something else in there if to
allergic to pussy.</v>

155
00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:04.380
Stupid.
I don't even know the dude.
Then if there was an opening right there.

156
00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:07.820
He's a his he,
yeah,
and he is allergic to alcohol.
So what happens when you drink?

157
00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:11.280
Oh,
he breaks out.
If you throw a peanut on his face,
his face will swell up.
Wow,

158
00:09:11.281 --> 00:09:14.130
that's crazy.
Talk about fucking being helpless on stage.

159
00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:16.810
Someone doesn't like your throat showing just flicks a peanut allergy.

160
00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:20.760
Does he know?
He knows people but now people know now people,
I just fucked him,

161
00:09:20.761 --> 00:09:22.970
mocked him out man.
People going to be throwing peanuts at them.

162
00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:26.250
That's just kind of fucked up because I've worked in summit so many kitchens

163
00:09:26.251 --> 00:09:30.690
before where like easily there could be peanut in something and then just be

164
00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:33.210
dumb waitress that didn't know or you're at the,

165
00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:36.870
you're making a salad and a peanut flies into something and it just seems like

166
00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:40.860
ties like pad Thai peanut sauce and shit.

167
00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:44.490
Lady in front of me was allergic to shellfish on the fight yesterday coming back

168
00:09:44.491 --> 00:09:49.491
from DC and they gave her a shrimp and put it in front of her and she flipped

169
00:09:49.741 --> 00:09:51.540
out.
She was like,
I can't have it around me.
I can't,

170
00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:54.420
I can't even be around it like and I was like,

171
00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:57.180
oh that's if we have the land of fucking pain.

172
00:09:57.181 --> 00:10:00.330
Cause there's chick canny felt shellfish.
Whoa.
She was freaking out.

173
00:10:00.331 --> 00:10:02.490
She was freaking me out.
Pretty bad people do though.
Cause that's her.

174
00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:05.770
Think about that.
That's your windpipe like I'm allergic to durables.
Right,
right.

175
00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:10.620
And people wouldn't recognize it and I had fucking bash your swell up and stuff.

176
00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.900
My wife,
my kids got at her school,

177
00:10:12.901 --> 00:10:15.810
they got a durable and so my wife was playing with the durable one morning and

178
00:10:15.811 --> 00:10:18.480
then washed her hands,
got in the car,
grabbed the steering wheel.

179
00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:22.260
I went to take my sister to the airport,
grabbed the steering wheel.
My eyes shut.

180
00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:24.090
This,
this part,
you know this part of your eye,

181
00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:27.630
that lining part swole up over my eyes.
Oh,
I'm okay.

182
00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:32.040
I started co water's coming out of my eyes and it's burning lines down my face.

183
00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:34.200
My windpipe closes up and I'm just like,

184
00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.780
I don't know what's happening at the time cause I'm like,

185
00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:40.320
I just fucking Santa car.
I'm like,
Oh shit,
this is a stroke.

186
00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:43.470
Something's going down.
I call my wife and then I started thinking,

187
00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:47.010
did she fucking play with the Jerboa?
I just asked out of the blue.
She was like,

188
00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:50.550
but I washed my hands and I was like,
fucking wow.

189
00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:54.740
Can you believe that?
That's what I rely on my hands now.
Right.

190
00:10:54.741 --> 00:10:56.820
You fuck you did.

191
00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:01.860
Was your last your fucking hands trying to make up for it?

192
00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:05.490
Revision is history of Motherfucker,
but yeah,
but I washed my,
yeah.

193
00:11:05.491 --> 00:11:07.920
Well that's one of the nonsense.
Craziness.

194
00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:09.730
It sounds like something with a 13 year old would tell you.

195
00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:12.600
So could you walk through like a pet store if you just didn't touch anything or

196
00:11:12.601 --> 00:11:15.540
have you ever done that just because you're feeling dangerous on a Saturday?

197
00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:17.220
Fuck No.
So crazy.

198
00:11:17.221 --> 00:11:20.070
So anybody that has a durable in their hand and touch the door Knob,

199
00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:22.430
you can touch that.
And which is Jackie?
Oh,

200
00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:25.190
if I thought like I'm allergic to cats,
but I live with my,

201
00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:29.130
my wife has a cat so I live with it.
So I've gotten over the allergy.
Wow.

202
00:11:29.131 --> 00:11:31.530
That must've been crazy in the beginning of the relationship.
Huh?

203
00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:35.910
Fucking talk about swallowing your pride and fucking deciding and my life is

204
00:11:35.911 --> 00:11:39.600
more less important.
Dating this chick.
Wow.
And the doctor,

205
00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:42.270
we sat down with an hour,
it's just one time.
And he's like,
so here's the deal.

206
00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:44.310
The cat cannot be in the room with him.

207
00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:49.330
Or One night he might die and then you and the cat is fucking there.

208
00:11:49.331 --> 00:11:54.040
Any website.
But I love the cat.
She tried,
she tried,
but she hear the cat

209
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:56.320
<v 1>clawing under the door and she wanted to let them in.</v>

210
00:11:56.321 --> 00:12:00.160
Let them see she's done the cat longer than me.
I'm like,
four months in,
Oh fuck.

211
00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:04.570
It was all sold.
Destructive.
You got chose over killed.

212
00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:08.340
I'm going to have to kill that cow,
dude.
The cat,
she called one night,
she,

213
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:12.340
when we were moving apartment,
she was like,
we can't find Gus Gus.
And I was like,

214
00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:17.290
it's too bad.
I was like,
sweet.
And then I came home for like a day,

215
00:12:17.291 --> 00:12:18.610
we couldn't find this cat.
Right.

216
00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:21.790
And then my daughters are getting upset because they're like,
Daddy,
Gus,
Gus is,

217
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.760
he's hungry.
I'm like,
he's a fucking street.
Caddy can fend for himself.

218
00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:28.750
So then I go into the older old apartment to look for him and I hear him,

219
00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.310
he's in the fucking dryer.

220
00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:34.540
Oh you turned in front of me is like there's a moment where you have to make the

221
00:12:34.541 --> 00:12:35.200
call.

222
00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:39.430
Do I just not say anything and just leave like in that then those fucking movies

223
00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:40.760
where you just go,
ah,

224
00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:44.560
and just walk by or do I rescue the cat and deal with my allergies?
And I'm like,

225
00:12:44.561 --> 00:12:48.340
I'm can't fucking kill an animal.
I can't let an animal die on my watch.

226
00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:52.390
Not like daddy not to kill it.
We stop on its head,

227
00:12:52.391 --> 00:12:56.950
punched it or kill it.
Kill my cat.
When I was in my phone,

228
00:12:56.951 --> 00:13:01.680
when I was in high school,
my dad accidentally threw the cat and the dryer.
Yeah.

229
00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:05.320
I didn't know the cat had gone to sleep in the hammock or in the,
in the um,

230
00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:10.090
the hamper.
Cause it was a warm clothes in the hamper.
And um,
no,
no,
no.

231
00:13:10.091 --> 00:13:11.980
That's not the of the story.
The story was there was,

232
00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:15.070
I guess he went to sleep in the dryer,
whatever.

233
00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:18.460
Somehow or another the cat got in the fucking dryer by accident and my dad

234
00:13:18.461 --> 00:13:21.500
hurdle is thump,
thump,
thump,
thump,
thump,
thump,
thump.

235
00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:25.630
And he opened it once and looked in.
The cat was out and the cat didn't move,

236
00:13:25.631 --> 00:13:27.310
so it was like,
well,
why don't we just,
nothing's in here.

237
00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:30.910
And so he shouted again and again from the dump dump,
dump,
dump.

238
00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:33.160
And they had to like a couple of minutes to this man.

239
00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:34.930
Then he opens it up and the cat comes out,

240
00:13:34.931 --> 00:13:38.450
screech in and one of his teeth was broken off and my,

241
00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:42.820
my father felt so bad.
He felt awful.
It was just a such a bad scene.

242
00:13:42.821 --> 00:13:45.250
You know the cat lived though.
That's a shitty story.

243
00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:48.760
Cat lived with one fucked up tooth.

244
00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:52.180
He says one fucked up tooth that reminded you of like no one did.

245
00:13:52.181 --> 00:13:53.140
This cat's crazy.

246
00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:58.350
Imagine one day you wake up and your blackness and you're falling on metal every

247
00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:01.540
half a second,
you just get beat over the head.

248
00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:04.840
If someone's beating the fuck out of you and you're flipping through the air,

249
00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:09.940
what a crazy way to wake up inside a dry and then to survive that after minutes

250
00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:10.870
and minutes and then fucking drive.

251
00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:14.530
My buddy who passed out and fell into a pool and that was a terrifying way to

252
00:14:14.531 --> 00:14:17.710
wake up.
He did Ibogaine the cat needs.
I'm just going to say,

253
00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:21.530
why don't you heal that cannabis and psychedelics,
Hilda countless,

254
00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:24.700
some ecstasy by the way,
don't,
don't listen to anything I say.

255
00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:28.030
Don't take anything I tell you to take.
Stop it.
Don't,
don't listen.

256
00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.210
I am just a fucking comedian.
All right?

257
00:14:30.211 --> 00:14:34.030
I am not qualified to be diagnosing life changing chemicals to any fucking

258
00:14:34.031 --> 00:14:37.600
freaks.
A lot of those guys that come back like my cousin,

259
00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:41.170
they're fucking fearless from the war.
You can't fuck.

260
00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:43.270
You can't phase these dudes like,
yeah.

261
00:14:43.271 --> 00:14:46.030
Once you've watched a bunch of people shoot at you and you shoot it and kill

262
00:14:46.031 --> 00:14:49.510
people and then you got some fucking frat boy telling you he's going to knock

263
00:14:49.511 --> 00:14:52.040
your teeth in at a bar and you watch my

264
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:55.450
<v 2>cousin not give a shit.
Literally just go really,</v>

265
00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:58.670
like he got wasted this weekend and fell down a flight of stairs and split his

266
00:14:58.671 --> 00:15:02.640
head open.
And he was like,
and all his buddies are like,
he's fine.
I'm like,
dude,

267
00:15:02.641 --> 00:15:06.440
he has a head injury.
He fell down fucking that.
The DCM prob down those stairs.

268
00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:10.470
I never been to DC and proud.
It's like a fucking slippery icy stares.
Wow.

269
00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:13.370
And so he and they were like,
he's fine.
He's fine.
They'll call fucking ambulance.

270
00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:16.310
Just Johnny,
you gotta be fine.
Johnny going to be fine.
He's,
and he,

271
00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:18.960
and then he starts throwing up cause he's a concussion all over the place.

272
00:15:18.961 --> 00:15:21.110
And I'm like,
I'm like,
we're calling an ambulance.
I don't give a shit,

273
00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:23.750
but they're fucking,
you just can't feed these kids,
man.

274
00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:26.000
That's a new generation coming back here.
Toughen it up.

275
00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:29.770
<v 3>Yeah.
Now coming back here after those experiences,
hundreds of thousands of them.</v>

276
00:15:29.771 --> 00:15:34.720
Right.
God,
Oh,
stand up to that change.
Uh,
it's,
it's,
you know,
so unfortunate.

277
00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:38.830
You know,
it's so unfortunate that you got people that are willing to do,

278
00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:39.251
you know,

279
00:15:39.251 --> 00:15:42.640
literally anything for their country like Pat Tillman type people who really are

280
00:15:42.641 --> 00:15:46.630
true heroes.
And then,
you know,
you look at what they get used for,
you know,

281
00:15:46.631 --> 00:15:49.210
you look at how chaotic you talked to any soldier that comes back from

282
00:15:49.211 --> 00:15:51.640
Afghanistan and tell you it's fucking chaos over there.

283
00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:55.420
No one thinks you could fix that place.
That place is bananas.
That's fucked.

284
00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:59.010
So fucking war lords,
man.
It's like Michael Vick's dogs again,

285
00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:01.450
just kind of fucking crazy and there that,

286
00:16:01.451 --> 00:16:05.170
another thing is they fuck boys over there like on a regular basis.

287
00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:08.280
It's like there's all the weird culture over there where they,

288
00:16:08.281 --> 00:16:11.770
there's a lot of like men who taken like little young boys,

289
00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:14.590
like they fucked them like on a regular basis.

290
00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:18.160
It's like a natural part of their culture.
It's so common and so prevalent.

291
00:16:18.161 --> 00:16:20.350
Like everything over there is so alien to us.

292
00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:24.790
There's like one city in the whole country and the rest of the country.

293
00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:28.390
It's just like warlords.
It's like,
do you can't control it.

294
00:16:28.391 --> 00:16:31.210
There's like a hundred different fucking dudes with a hundred different,

295
00:16:31.211 --> 00:16:32.950
you know,
harems and you know,
they're,

296
00:16:32.951 --> 00:16:35.850
they're rocking one part of the country and holding it down and they need to

297
00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:38.110
know the best way they get information from the students,

298
00:16:38.111 --> 00:16:40.540
the way they communicate with these dudes.
They give him Viagra.

299
00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.760
That's what the American soldiers do.

300
00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:45.010
Viagara cause they can't fuck their wives anymore.

301
00:16:45.011 --> 00:16:47.770
So it's hard to hold this Harem.
It's hard to be a warlord when you,

302
00:16:47.771 --> 00:16:48.820
Dick doesn't work anymore.

303
00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:52.960
So they're given him Viagra and now he's like 60 year old dudes who were just

304
00:16:52.961 --> 00:16:56.200
trying to hang on and keep the young bucks at bay.

305
00:16:56.350 --> 00:17:00.100
Now they can bone again so they can get some credibility.
You can't have love it.

306
00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:02.800
18 hot young wives and not fuck any of them.

307
00:17:02.801 --> 00:17:05.500
Someone's going to fuck one of those bitches.
You know it's going to happen.

308
00:17:05.501 --> 00:17:07.530
You're going to have to shoot some young males or something.

309
00:17:07.531 --> 00:17:08.740
You're gonna have to prove your dominance.

310
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.370
<v 2>Wouldn't you have,
if you had gotten fucked in the ass as a child,</v>

311
00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:14.880
wouldn't you say I'm in his way?
I am.
I'd be like,
well,
I didn't enjoy that,

312
00:17:14.881 --> 00:17:16.230
so I'm not going to do it to somebody else.

313
00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:20.480
<v 3>Well,
that's an a rat,
rational,
logical way of thinking and,</v>

314
00:17:20.481 --> 00:17:24.230
but apparently what happens to some people's minds when something traumatic

315
00:17:24.231 --> 00:17:28.160
happens to them as their mind gets rewired in a very,
very unhealthy way.

316
00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:31.790
And somehow or another when people are molested,
they have,
uh,

317
00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:36.320
some folks have a,
an urge to do the exact same thing that happened to them,

318
00:17:36.321 --> 00:17:36.891
to someone else.

319
00:17:36.891 --> 00:17:40.460
Almost like they're reliving their pain and their tragedy and reintroducing it

320
00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:43.850
to another person to try to understand it or something.
I mean,
it's like,

321
00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:47.210
it becomes an addiction to them.
This,
it becomes very,
very sick.

322
00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:51.630
<v 1>Women sometimes get raped a state day raped.</v>

323
00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:55.920
Try to fuck the same guy over again to try to like make sure it was okay.
Wow.

324
00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:58.620
And then a lot of times those guys don't want to be in that situation again

325
00:17:58.621 --> 00:17:59.640
because I know they did the bad thing.

326
00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:03.090
So then they veer away from it and then that fucking ruins the woman that got

327
00:18:03.091 --> 00:18:06.640
date raped.
Oh God.
That's horrible,
man.
I hate psycho psychological shit.

328
00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:10.950
The way your brain tries to fix things is insane.
It isn't.
I think that's why.

329
00:18:10.951 --> 00:18:12.750
That's why I glean is so dangerous.

330
00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:15.890
You know when you hear about the kids at school to get stuffed in a locker and

331
00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:19.530
all those and then wind up committing suicide and some kid recently,
um,

332
00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:23.040
fuck this store was so crazy,
some,
I don't know the full details of it.

333
00:18:23.041 --> 00:18:25.740
It was someone something someone would toman but at some 14 year old kid,

334
00:18:25.741 --> 00:18:28.230
there was a bunch of kids,
they were out on some little event.

335
00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:32.160
This kid climbs to the top of a 10 stories,

336
00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:34.560
breaks a window and jumps out in front of everybody.

337
00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:38.370
So they're all on there on some fucking vacation or some school trip or some

338
00:18:38.371 --> 00:18:38.940
shit.

339
00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:42.750
This kid's smashes a window and just sky dives into the pavement in front of the

340
00:18:42.751 --> 00:18:47.130
whole class.
No bullied at all.
Nia,
I was bullied.
Yeah,

341
00:18:47.131 --> 00:18:49.050
that's how I got into martial arts.
Really?
Yeah.

342
00:18:49.051 --> 00:18:52.280
I think almost every comedian is bullied with me.
I,
I moved.
I was,
first of all,

343
00:18:52.281 --> 00:18:52.741
I was a little,

344
00:18:52.741 --> 00:18:56.370
I wasn't a big guy and I moved around a lot when my family was seven.

345
00:18:56.371 --> 00:19:00.570
We moved from New Jersey to Florida or New Jersey to California and then

346
00:19:00.571 --> 00:19:01.920
California to Florida.

347
00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:05.430
So it's like I never really like stayed long enough to make like good friends.

348
00:19:05.431 --> 00:19:06.600
I would like live in one place.

349
00:19:06.601 --> 00:19:10.140
And even California we lived in one street and the next year we lived,
you know,

350
00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:13.950
a half away across town.
And then,
you know,
in Florida we moved a couple of times.

351
00:19:13.951 --> 00:19:15.090
It's like,
man,

352
00:19:15.091 --> 00:19:17.970
I just never really had a chance to make like long lasting friends.

353
00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:22.110
I went to an all boys Catholic high school.
Oh Geez.
That was just torture meet.

354
00:19:22.111 --> 00:19:24.660
And then I was like the funny,
like the funny guy in my friends.

355
00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:27.000
So the older dudes are just fuck you up.

356
00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:29.760
And that wasn't even like bullying just beat me up.
Wow.
This is like,

357
00:19:29.761 --> 00:19:33.150
you just got,
you knew he got beaten up one time.
This,

358
00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:36.570
this guy on the baseball team,
uh,
Friday result,
I'll say his name.

359
00:19:36.571 --> 00:19:39.060
Like your shit that day.
He's still a beast.

360
00:19:39.061 --> 00:19:41.790
He was a beast when we were all fucking like children.

361
00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:43.530
He was the head like ball hair,

362
00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:48.450
like he was a monster to him and he sends a little kid with a beard.

363
00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:50.640
Do the guy was shaving in like eighth grade.

364
00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:52.950
I mean he was a monster in his arms were huge.

365
00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:56.840
And he was a captain of our baseball team and I was like probably junior or

366
00:19:56.850 --> 00:20:01.170
sophomore and he,
I was making a joke and he said,
Greg Sher shut your face.

367
00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:04.680
So I like as a joke and that he did not get that.

368
00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:07.500
And then he went to go fight me and then I was like,
but then they broke it up.

369
00:20:07.501 --> 00:20:08.940
Wow.
So then we get done,

370
00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:11.970
he goes into the dugout and I'm playing catch with my buddies,

371
00:20:11.971 --> 00:20:15.900
Joe and Troy Dean and warming up and we see them walking out and we're walking

372
00:20:15.901 --> 00:20:19.800
in there like,
oh,
Freddy gets upset sometimes,
but he's just coming to apologize.

373
00:20:19.801 --> 00:20:21.000
You look,
he's got a bandage,

374
00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:23.190
probably had enough to the bio and batting practice and he's just going to say

375
00:20:23.191 --> 00:20:25.620
sorry.
So it was like,
okay,
don't worry.
I got this one.

376
00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:28.670
So I have a glove in hand ball on the other hand I'm like,
Hey Freddie.

377
00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:30.080
And then he just with the baseball batches,

378
00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:34.020
<v 4>beat the shit out of me.
My friends got all of them.</v>

379
00:20:34.021 --> 00:20:39.021
They couldn't pull this guy off of me and never let go of the ball and then,

380
00:20:40.021 --> 00:20:40.370
you know,

381
00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:45.370
and then of course I just go to crying cause I was still like a young boy and

382
00:20:45.781 --> 00:20:48.040
then,
and then he beat me up and then the coach was

383
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:51.160
<v 2>in there and sudden and fucking,
and then we both played left field together.</v>

384
00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:53.710
So I had to go out and sit in left field with them after that.

385
00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:57.280
But those things like that's why I think women's,
that's patty.
You,

386
00:20:57.610 --> 00:21:01.090
how do you get past that moment and when run by him again when this guy beat the

387
00:21:01.091 --> 00:21:06.070
shit out of here.
He came to see me at the Tampa Improv recently and he,
he,

388
00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:08.620
me and him probably never talked about it.
We were cool after that.
Like,

389
00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:11.980
I mean we were like,
you know,
we put it on the same team for a year after that.

390
00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:14.890
And,
but he came to the camp and probably he's like,
what's up man?
I was like,
hey,

391
00:21:14.891 --> 00:21:19.750
how you doing?
And then,
but I'm still like gun shy,
you know,

392
00:21:19.751 --> 00:21:23.230
cow head.
The guy in Tampa radio show cow head.

393
00:21:23.231 --> 00:21:26.230
I used to tell a story about getting in a fight with a black guy.
There was a,

394
00:21:26.231 --> 00:21:28.630
I did all my hour special and it's a real story.

395
00:21:28.631 --> 00:21:31.240
It's a true story about getting the shit kicked out of my [inaudible] Buckeye.

396
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:34.300
Cal had looked him up and found the dude and was like,

397
00:21:34.301 --> 00:21:37.510
I'm bringing them in studio.
Oh my God.
I was like,
please don't fucking do that.

398
00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:41.290
I was praying the guy was dead and be his daughter,

399
00:21:41.291 --> 00:21:43.750
listens to the show or whatever.
I was like fuck.

400
00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:48.040
Cause I'm telling jokes about this guy on stage for the past eight years,

401
00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:50.330
<v 3>there was this one dude that I went to high school with.</v>

402
00:21:50.331 --> 00:21:52.250
I don't even remember his name.
I think it was Kevin.

403
00:21:52.251 --> 00:21:55.790
He was this black kid that was way bigger than everybody else who's like this

404
00:21:55.791 --> 00:21:59.030
football player.
I didn't really know him very well.
I knew his brother,

405
00:21:59.031 --> 00:22:02.150
his brother was a nice guy,
but he was a scary dude to me.

406
00:22:02.151 --> 00:22:05.540
It just looked like look,
a Mike Tyson looking dude.
Yeah.
And you know,

407
00:22:05.541 --> 00:22:09.380
I remember like no one ever fucked with this kid and everybody was always

408
00:22:09.381 --> 00:22:11.870
nervous,
but there was something about them where I'd be like,
man,

409
00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:15.470
this guy just seems like he just seems like too dangerous.

410
00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:18.380
Like there's something about him,
like that makes me fucking nervous.

411
00:22:18.381 --> 00:22:22.010
Like someone could be that much bigger than you when you're 16 years old that

412
00:22:22.011 --> 00:22:24.380
much.
It turns out he bought up murdering somebody.

413
00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:28.540
<v 2>Oh yeah.
We have one kid or our neighborhood.
Uh,</v>

414
00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:31.240
definitely won't say this guy's fucking name.
Um,

415
00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:35.710
the one kid you knew was weird but you didn't know like how to,
like,
you just,

416
00:22:35.711 --> 00:22:37.540
everyone would be like,
who wants to go ride bikes?
And he's like,

417
00:22:37.541 --> 00:22:40.600
who dares me to go in the woods and put a stick in my ass?
Like that kind of kid.

418
00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:43.540
Just crazy.
One night he was,
he had the keys to his,

419
00:22:43.541 --> 00:22:44.830
this chick that lives in our neighborhood.

420
00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:46.900
He had accused her house because his parents were watching their house and he's

421
00:22:46.901 --> 00:22:49.210
like,
hey,
you want to go in her house and get weird?
And I was like,

422
00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:51.790
they're not here.
He's like,
no,
come on and be fucking crazy.

423
00:22:51.791 --> 00:22:56.400
I go in there and cut the SPA pussies out of their underwear.
And I was like,
oh.

424
00:22:56.530 --> 00:23:00.500
So my sister calls me like,
like six months ago.
She's like,
uh,
you remember?
Uh,

425
00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:05.890
John?
And I was like,
yeah.
She was like,
he's in jail.
I go,
really?
She goes,
yeah.

426
00:23:05.891 --> 00:23:07.150
He was working for,
um,

427
00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:10.120
for circuit city when they're going out of business and he stole one of their

428
00:23:10.121 --> 00:23:13.480
trucks,
filled with a bunch of equipment.
And I was like,
really?
And she goes,
yeah.

429
00:23:13.481 --> 00:23:15.700
And they arrested him and then they fingerprinted him and found out he had been

430
00:23:15.701 --> 00:23:18.910
killing checks down by the causeway.
Wow.
I was like,
cereal,

431
00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:23.080
if you fucking said serial killer to me,
I would've been like,

432
00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:26.830
if I was the guy next door,
I'd be like,
I fucking knew it.
I knew it.

433
00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:31.160
I saw that comment.
Wow.
Holy Shit.
How many girls did he kill?
I've no idea,
but,

434
00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:34.600
but I was like,
and I've looked for it online,
online,
I can't find it online.

435
00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:39.480
<v 3>It's so hard when you run into someone who's completely fucking crazy.
It's like,</v>

436
00:23:39.481 --> 00:23:43.140
what,
what,
you know,
there's no way to fix that guy when you're 15,

437
00:23:43.141 --> 00:23:46.100
16 years old or whatever and you're all of a,
you're going to high school

438
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:49.430
<v 1>and you're hanging out with this kid who you know is completely insane and it's</v>

439
00:23:49.431 --> 00:23:52.280
a small neighborhood,
like eight boys.
That's it.
Oh my God.

440
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:56.720
And we spend the night at this kid's house and like,
just fuck I,
and I'm like,

441
00:23:56.900 --> 00:24:00.920
Holy Shit,
man.
He,
I'm going under.
When he started,

442
00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:03.680
you've got to,
you've got to be,
it starts young.

443
00:24:03.681 --> 00:24:07.040
I remember him shooting a frog with a BB gun and I remember him asking me to do

444
00:24:07.041 --> 00:24:10.110
it and I couldn't do it.
I couldn't kill an animal.
I just couldn't in my head,

445
00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:13.220
you know,
at that age.
But he was like,
it's fun.
It's easy,
it's easy,

446
00:24:13.221 --> 00:24:16.580
they don't move.
But,
uh,
I think you have to start.

447
00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:20.060
It's got to start in college.
I wonder what it is.
You know,

448
00:24:20.061 --> 00:24:21.950
because some people like Jeffrey Dahmer,

449
00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:24.800
they say there's nothing wrong with his upbringing.
You know,

450
00:24:24.801 --> 00:24:27.890
some people were abused when they were younger.
Some people have some,
you know,

451
00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:30.710
various reasons for why they're so fucking crazy and psychotic.

452
00:24:30.711 --> 00:24:33.590
But with dom or Tom or was one of those weird ones where they like,

453
00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:37.220
there's nothing's wrong with his childhood,
but what parent's going to be like,

454
00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:40.280
yeah,
I did that.
Right,
right.
Of course.
Of course.
Dahmer's parents aren't be like,

455
00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:43.620
fucking didn't know.
You're not supposed to finger they're assholes.
Right.

456
00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:46.580
By the way,
speaking to figure their asshole.

457
00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:50.570
I saw a clip online of your show where you went to the Gracie Academy in

458
00:24:50.571 --> 00:24:54.190
Torrance and a,
you're talking about defense and he said,
well,

459
00:24:54.191 --> 00:24:57.500
I'll just grab their balls and figured their ass all at Horry and just stone

460
00:24:57.501 --> 00:25:01.160
faced you and the way you held it,
dude was so funny.

461
00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:03.110
I was laughing out loud.

462
00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:06.940
You held it just staring at him for like fucking 10 seconds,
man,

463
00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:10.250
where it wasn't like no one said anything.
And then he's like,
okay,
let's go.

464
00:25:10.251 --> 00:25:14.690
Loads of techniques.
Some arm locks in some joint locks in some chokes.
Dude,

465
00:25:14.691 --> 00:25:19.550
I got choked out that Dan has that isn't that fucked me up for like a week cause

466
00:25:19.551 --> 00:25:21.290
you know what it's like to to die.

467
00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:26.320
You know what it's like to be totally helpless and your wind pipe to close and

468
00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:29.750
your blood to stop and you fight it just like you've seen the movies where you

469
00:25:29.751 --> 00:25:33.590
go.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Very helpless.

470
00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:36.230
Very helpless.
Especially with the g on man.

471
00:25:36.231 --> 00:25:38.070
When guys get color chokes on you that she needed,

472
00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:43.070
he gave me like the car very hard to defend those fucking with dudes because I

473
00:25:43.071 --> 00:25:47.090
realize now everyone's a bad ass.
Everyone is.

474
00:25:47.091 --> 00:25:51.890
I almost got in a fight.
I'm just going to fight recently.
A real yeah,

475
00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:55.980
because I just was like my bro,
my drives,
no.

476
00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:59.990
Stober it was in the morning I was going to shoot something for comedy central

477
00:25:59.991 --> 00:26:01.370
and I,
my,
I needed a bathing suit.

478
00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:05.540
So my sisters live on an apartment building a blow Starbucks.

479
00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:09.320
So I like fly in and I kind of block it at two spaces and I,

480
00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:12.170
they're just going to throw my bathing suit to me so they throw it.

481
00:26:12.171 --> 00:26:15.620
And then as I pull out,
I realize I blocked it and it's got pissed.
So he,
um,

482
00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:18.830
he's really pissed as not,
as I pulled out,
he zooms in,

483
00:26:18.831 --> 00:26:21.710
gets out of his car and starts yelling at me.
Now I'm Duco,

484
00:26:21.711 --> 00:26:22.760
I've been in a lot of fist fights,

485
00:26:22.761 --> 00:26:25.850
so I do come from that kind of like mentality of like talk shit.

486
00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:29.390
And that's my mentality at the time.
So I,

487
00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:34.190
I said Talk Shit and let's fight.
I'll fight.
You just ready to fight some dude?

488
00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:37.430
No,
no,
no,
not now.
Not now.
How long ago was this?
This was,

489
00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:41.350
this was like three years ago.
Okay.
You're a different guy now.
Barry,

490
00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:43.950
this moment.
And then the moment happened the next day.

491
00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:47.910
So then he tells me and I wrote out my window and I yelled at him.
I go,

492
00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:51.390
I was just trying to get my bathing suit,
like,
like that's going to fucking like,

493
00:26:51.391 --> 00:26:54.360
he's going to go,
oh,
I didn't know.
Go ahead.
But I was like,
that was my defense.

494
00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:57.870
I'm just getting my fucking bathing suit.
I wasn't being a dick.
And then he goes,

495
00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:59.010
fuck,
you learn how to drive.

496
00:26:59.011 --> 00:27:01.680
And so I'd get out of the car and then I stand up my come out here,

497
00:27:01.681 --> 00:27:03.720
I can stand on the car and I go,
come out here and be a man.

498
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:07.230
Prove your fucking man.
Oh No.
Oh my God,

499
00:27:07.231 --> 00:27:10.020
you're crazy at a fucking Starbucks.
Now everyone's like,
oh,

500
00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:13.250
do you know how to fight it all?
No,
but I know.
Yeah,
I know how the,

501
00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:18.000
and this was La,
right?
This is la have you do have martial arts training.

502
00:27:18.001 --> 00:27:21.210
None whatsoever.
You don't know how to box.
Never wrestled.
Never box,

503
00:27:21.211 --> 00:27:24.240
never wrestled sparring.
Just fist fights in college and damn dude,

504
00:27:24.241 --> 00:27:26.310
what are you doing?
You crazy.
Exactly.

505
00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:28.680
And it was at that moment that I realized that he walked out,

506
00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:32.140
I would have to fist fight.
Right.
And what if he's good?
He is do,

507
00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:34.830
what do you do if you get out there and you start talking shit to a dude and the

508
00:27:34.831 --> 00:27:38.570
dude just holds his hands up real natural and starts bouncing around on his toes

509
00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:41.960
to get my car drive away or he just pulls out a gun and shit.
Yeah,
yeah.
Is La?

510
00:27:42.010 --> 00:27:46.120
Yeah,
that too.
But it's that moment.
You might need your ass first.
Yeah.

511
00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:48.060
You need that one moment where you go,
all right,

512
00:27:48.061 --> 00:27:52.800
that's never going to happen again.
Yeah.
Why,
why,
why have unnecessary conflict?

513
00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:54.870
You know,
that's an unnecessary moment.

514
00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:59.130
That's like just management right there and management of stress and emotions.

515
00:27:59.131 --> 00:28:02.040
Yes.
Because really you don't even know this guy.
If that was you,

516
00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:05.940
what if you had done this and the guy who you cut off was like your best friend

517
00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:08.700
and you know,
you cut them off and you're like,
fuck,

518
00:28:08.701 --> 00:28:12.450
I can't believe I cut Mike off.
You know,
Mike is my best friend.
Yeah.
You know,

519
00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:15.990
the,
your interaction with this guy is all based on,
you know,
this,
this,

520
00:28:15.991 --> 00:28:20.040
this conflict that you're having.
But those treated though guy,
mine I,
no,
no,
no.

521
00:28:20.041 --> 00:28:22.790
But if you could rewire your brain to try to think like that.

522
00:28:22.810 --> 00:28:27.540
Was he driving a Prius?
Now he's driving a TV douche bag.
I might've done

523
00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:31.650
deal BMW.
I told you I'm on a eight.

524
00:28:31.651 --> 00:28:35.430
Eight count eight so far I've seen eight Prius's flick cigarettes out there when

525
00:28:35.431 --> 00:28:38.260
he owes eight.
That's crazy.
It's amazing.
I,

526
00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:40.260
I started noticing it in San Francisco.
I'm like,

527
00:28:40.261 --> 00:28:44.070
why do I keep seeing these eco cunts throwing cigarettes out their window?

528
00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:46.530
There's some,
they have some weird justification.

529
00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:49.440
So you could also think that you could just own a Prius because you want to save

530
00:28:49.441 --> 00:28:51.930
money on gas.
You don't give a shit about fucking,
yeah,

531
00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:54.630
I swear to God I unplugged this fucking country phone.
Yeah,

532
00:28:54.631 --> 00:28:56.940
it's funny now I sound funny dude.

533
00:28:59.470 --> 00:29:00.100
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

534
00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:03.750
<v 1>Hello?

537
00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:11.980

Great place to pick up chicks.

539
00:29:17.831 --> 00:29:21.590
Is the subway right underneath the planned parenthood and get a bunch of sites

540
00:29:21.591 --> 00:29:23.610
where,
what were we talking about before we got cut out?
Yeah.

541
00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:27.010
Don't go and get an if not.
No,
I mean it's like a total hippie thing to say,

542
00:29:27.011 --> 00:29:29.410
well look at that guy as if he's your brother and treat him as such,

543
00:29:29.411 --> 00:29:32.260
but you know a lot of shit can be avoided.

544
00:29:32.261 --> 00:29:35.200
It just with like cool talking to people,

545
00:29:35.290 --> 00:29:38.320
Shit that could just turn your whole life into ugliness.
Oh Dude.

546
00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:42.250
Fucking a new gynecologist punched the one time and killed him.

547
00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:45.580
He fell back on a,
on a thing and Kevin James went to a,

548
00:29:45.581 --> 00:29:49.270
he was a bouncer for a while and he was a bouncer with this dude and a fight

549
00:29:49.271 --> 00:29:52.690
broke out between some drunk,
something happened,
bouncer punched this kid.

550
00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:56.140
The kid fell unconscious and banged his head off the curb and died.

551
00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:59.020
The bouncer fucking college kids trying to make some money.

552
00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:02.010
All of a sudden he's in jail for like years,
you know?

553
00:30:02.011 --> 00:30:04.240
It was like some serious shit.
He got charged with manslaughter.

554
00:30:04.241 --> 00:30:07.930
I think that's a lot of the reason why I wear hats and sunglasses so much.

555
00:30:07.931 --> 00:30:10.030
And I always look at that ground.
I've never could,

556
00:30:10.031 --> 00:30:12.460
especially already don't worry.
I know what,
I don't care.

557
00:30:12.461 --> 00:30:14.950
I don't need to talk to anybody.
If I want to talk to somebody,

558
00:30:14.951 --> 00:30:18.580
I'll go to Yale year know type attitude.
Like I like people.

559
00:30:18.581 --> 00:30:21.850
It's funny when you see those people that hand out things on the streets,

560
00:30:21.851 --> 00:30:24.910
you know like flyers or people like trying to get you to sign things.

561
00:30:24.911 --> 00:30:29.230
When you walk into the grocery store you see that I watched them like go to

562
00:30:29.231 --> 00:30:33.070
every person and I get up and they don't say a word to me.
They like,

563
00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:38.170
cause I purposely sent out a vibe to be like,
don't talk to me.
Yeah,

564
00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:41.740
I'm not happy when they get me in the parking lot of the supermarket when I'm

565
00:30:41.741 --> 00:30:44.800
trying to put my groceries into the truck.
You know,
what are you doing?

566
00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:48.070
This guy comes up to me with his one finger up in the air.
Okay.

567
00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:51.820
Holding it up in the air,
like above his head.
And he points it at me and he goes,

568
00:30:51.910 --> 00:30:56.200
do you have one minute for gay rights?
No.
Do you have one minute for gay rights?

569
00:30:56.201 --> 00:30:59.230
We're talking about lesbian rights.
And I was like,
yeah,
dude,

570
00:30:59.231 --> 00:31:02.560
I'm going to my fucking car.
Get outta here.
This is nonsense.

571
00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:05.470
No one minute for you.
This ain't about gay rights,
man.

572
00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:09.340
You're not going to fix gay rights by me giving you a dollar or by me giving you

573
00:31:09.341 --> 00:31:12.580
my fucking email address.
That's not going to fix gay rights.
What's gonna fix?

574
00:31:12.581 --> 00:31:15.610
Gay Rights is voting and people learning how to be nice to each other and not

575
00:31:15.611 --> 00:31:18.300
being prejudice.
Not Some fucking Weirdo who uh,

576
00:31:18.301 --> 00:31:20.710
costs you in a parking lot with a finger in your face.

577
00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:22.450
Do you have one minute for gay rights?

578
00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:27.330
He was just so pronounced Lee offensively gay,
you know,

579
00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:31.900
with his finger in my face.
Okay guys,
mom and take guys just fucking hate me.

580
00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:34.570
Why?
I don't know.
They see me and I think they just look at me and they're like,

581
00:31:34.571 --> 00:31:38.020
fucking,
that guy was a nightmare in highschool.
Think you're homophobic.
Oh,

582
00:31:38.021 --> 00:31:40.820
in a heartbeat.
On the furthest thing from homophobic.

583
00:31:40.821 --> 00:31:42.830
He looked like a decent bear,
you know,

584
00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:47.710
do a decent bear bears for folks at home that are innocent is what a hairy,

585
00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:50.700
overweight gay man bear.
That's a call.

586
00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:54.760
And they'll know a bunch of people are looking at this going,
oh,

587
00:31:54.761 --> 00:31:58.480
that is a little bit,
it's just show got so gay.
Right.

588
00:31:58.481 --> 00:32:03.481
They're both until he just almost kissed going to gay porn accidentally.

589
00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:08.210
Accidentally.
I've seen a bunch of shit.
I'm by a website,

590
00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:10.930
there's always stuff.
But one time,
uh,
I was uh,

591
00:32:10.931 --> 00:32:14.770
I picked up this girl in Long Island and we went back to her place and she had,

592
00:32:14.771 --> 00:32:18.220
she said,
there's this video that's here that was here when I moved in.

593
00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:20.560
I think it's a porn.
And I go,
Oh yeah.

594
00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:24.970
And so she throws it in and it's these two dudes in the woods and one dude's got

595
00:32:24.971 --> 00:32:28.060
his back against the tree and the other dude is looking at them.
I'm like,

596
00:32:28.061 --> 00:32:31.690
why is he looking at him like that?
I didn't know it was the gay porn.

597
00:32:31.691 --> 00:32:36.340
I thought it was a port put in a lot of backstory out it like this is going to

598
00:32:36.341 --> 00:32:40.070
be a strange story.
I never did like story ones.
I like

599
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:42.710
<v 3>the clips just cut right to the bone and I don't need to know that you're a</v>

600
00:32:42.711 --> 00:32:44.630
pizza man.
Okay.
So anyway,
this,

601
00:32:44.631 --> 00:32:48.050
this dude pulls the guy's pants down and starts sucking his cock and I literally

602
00:32:48.051 --> 00:32:52.790
like started hyperventilating.
I was like,
wow.
Like I'd never seen mind you,

603
00:32:52.791 --> 00:32:56.090
you kids today,
you grow up.
This is the age of the Internet.
Your,

604
00:32:56.091 --> 00:32:58.520
you see dude sucking Dick all the time.

605
00:32:58.910 --> 00:33:02.990
I had never seen a man to actually suck a dick until this moment.

606
00:33:03.170 --> 00:33:04.730
And I was probably 22 years old,

607
00:33:04.731 --> 00:33:09.260
somewhere around 2123 so this guy starts talking,
this guy's cock.

608
00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:12.740
And I was like,
wow,
they really do do it.
That's what I,

609
00:33:12.741 --> 00:33:15.860
that's what I thought in my head.
Like I knew what that's what gay was like.

610
00:33:15.861 --> 00:33:19.460
I lived in San Francisco for three years when I was younger.
My,
actually my aunt,

611
00:33:19.461 --> 00:33:20.480
I told this story before,

612
00:33:20.481 --> 00:33:23.690
but my aunt used to get high with these gay guys that live next door and they

613
00:33:23.691 --> 00:33:27.620
used to smoke pot and get naked together and like one guy would play the bongos

614
00:33:27.621 --> 00:33:30.680
and they were really weird and I was like this big muscular black iron is white

615
00:33:30.681 --> 00:33:34.220
little bitch boyfriend and my aunt would go over and smoke pot.

616
00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:37.430
So I grew up with gay people.
Now it didn't bother me.
I didn't know.

617
00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:40.820
But watching the guy actually suck the cock.
I'm like Whoa,

618
00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:45.270
you can't take that back to you are sucking at cock.

619
00:33:46.270 --> 00:33:49.560
I can't believe that.
I could,

620
00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:52.820
couldn't believe that they could get people to do it.
Even if you were gay,

621
00:33:52.821 --> 00:33:56.060
you want people to know that much.
You wouldn't be able to see the gay stuff.

622
00:33:56.820 --> 00:34:00.600
<v 1>I used to have a joke about you're going to hate this but why would I hate it</v>

623
00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:01.800
cause cause I used to,

624
00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:06.300
I used to say as it looked in the eye and say who's seen a gay porn?
No one.

625
00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:08.820
I said who's seen the UFC?
And then everyone I go,

626
00:34:08.821 --> 00:34:12.230
here's my pitch mixed the two genres,
right?

627
00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:15.720
Fights where the winner gets to fuck the loser in the ass.

628
00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:19.350
I'm not saying anyone would watch the entire fight,

629
00:34:19.351 --> 00:34:22.410
but how hard would you fight if your asshole was on the line?

630
00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:25.620
You would fight hard to share.
No tap house.
No tap outs.

631
00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:29.880
Just the best part that I thought would be after the guy is unconscious watching

632
00:34:29.881 --> 00:34:33.720
Brock Lesnar tried to get hard thing like I just don't want to get hard before I

633
00:34:33.721 --> 00:34:36.000
can put them in the ass.
Come on,
come on,
come on,
come on,
come on.
So what is that?

634
00:34:36.001 --> 00:34:38.640
Yeah.
What if he takes him down to rape them and the guys out?

635
00:34:38.641 --> 00:34:39.300
He can't get it out.

636
00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:41.340
Can't get it up and he's just sitting there and then the guy starts coming to
it.

637
00:34:41.341 --> 00:34:42.860
He's got a service into my own contest.

638
00:34:43.610 --> 00:34:48.440
They win by tap in tap that ass.
But yeah,

639
00:34:49.290 --> 00:34:52.400
they always get like a vote.
I hate them though.
That's hilarious.
I don't know,

640
00:34:52.410 --> 00:34:57.060
I just thought like UFC,
it brings up the whole,
so gave a two guys rubbing Dixie.

641
00:34:57.070 --> 00:34:58.980
What guys like you like to think it's gay.

642
00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:04.260
I might've thought that when I first thought of it the first time in ever way.

643
00:35:04.261 --> 00:35:06.180
Now you know,
I don't think of it,
but it's funny.

644
00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:08.160
Every time I go to like open mikes and stuff like that.

645
00:35:08.170 --> 00:35:11.040
Then whenever they talk about you have ca that that comes up,

646
00:35:11.041 --> 00:35:15.250
they shut the gates.
That's like Asian drivers are black guys can't tip,
you know?

647
00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:17.760
It's all like,
it's all right there.
It's a hot topic.

648
00:35:17.761 --> 00:35:21.970
It's the both the easiest conclusion to draw,
you know?
Yes.

649
00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:26.930
He's guys in their underwear.
They stop wearing the tight ones.

650
00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:30.630
Tight ones.
The player will still rock the tights.

651
00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:35.880
It was packaged there.
You know what I'm saying?

652
00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:42.600
<v 3>He just smuggling it.
No.
Did you ever fight in UFC?
No,
I would not.
Never.</v>

653
00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:47.220
I don't think you should ever dabble in fighting.
I think fighting is a very,

654
00:35:47.221 --> 00:35:47.581
very,

655
00:35:47.581 --> 00:35:50.610
very dangerous thing and you should be obsessed with it and it should be your

656
00:35:50.611 --> 00:35:53.490
sole focus.
It shouldn't be,
you know,

657
00:35:53.491 --> 00:35:58.491
a standup comedian slash author slash podiatrist slash UFC fighter.

658
00:35:59.710 --> 00:36:02.350
<v 2>No one was the last fist fight you got in Lego provoked street.</v>

659
00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:06.240
<v 3>So I was in high school.
Really?
Yeah.
Now how the time I was in high school,</v>

660
00:36:06.241 --> 00:36:07.920
I was already a martial arts champion.
So I,

661
00:36:07.921 --> 00:36:11.730
I was so scared of getting bullied and kids fucking with me that I just became

662
00:36:11.731 --> 00:36:15.300
obsessed with martial arts.
Yeah.
And so when I was,
you know,

663
00:36:15.301 --> 00:36:17.970
16 was already winning all these,

664
00:36:17.971 --> 00:36:21.660
these big tournaments on a 17 I was the Massachusetts State Championship.

665
00:36:21.690 --> 00:36:24.090
I was finding in the men's divisions when I was a kid,

666
00:36:24.091 --> 00:36:28.440
when I was like 15 and 16 so most of the kids that I knew at the time,

667
00:36:28.441 --> 00:36:29.940
they all knew that I was doing that.
So,

668
00:36:29.970 --> 00:36:33.240
but I would just left me a lot when I was still terrified.
I was still scared.

669
00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:34.530
Even when I was fighting and tournaments,

670
00:36:34.531 --> 00:36:36.600
I was afraid of bullies and getting my ass kicked.

671
00:36:36.601 --> 00:36:39.190
I didn't totally believe that I could kick someone's ass really,

672
00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:43.950
even when I was knocking out grown men and inspiring and you know,
and then,

673
00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:47.700
you know,
having a fucking wars in the gym,
I would still run into bullies.

674
00:36:47.701 --> 00:36:50.520
And you know,
kids that I knew that were like bullies and I'd be scared of him.

675
00:36:50.910 --> 00:36:52.590
I just did.
I didn't want him to fuck with me.

676
00:36:52.591 --> 00:36:55.410
I wanted to make sure I can get away from,
let me just go around the outside.

677
00:36:55.470 --> 00:37:00.030
Like I even when I was winning fights against train fighters are still fucks

678
00:37:00.031 --> 00:37:00.580
with your hand.

679
00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:04.060
<v 2>Me and my friends that we all got bullied by the same bullies,
you know,</v>

680
00:37:04.061 --> 00:37:08.710
but we're all like the artist's kids,
you know,
I uh,
what we'd always do is like,

681
00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:12.040
like draw pictures of them like with Cox and their mouth and stuff like that.

682
00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:15.880
It's just like really like put them around like the bathrooms and like the

683
00:37:15.881 --> 00:37:17.400
girls' bathrooms would throw him in there.

684
00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:21.280
We just turn around the corner and just toss a bunch of drawings in there.
I,

685
00:37:21.370 --> 00:37:24.290
I'll say like,
you know,
copy them or do you just write the same drawing over?

686
00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:27.100
Yeah,
we copied them and then a copy machine.
Yeah.

687
00:37:27.610 --> 00:37:31.870
But we would make it like kind of like currency and they knew we were,

688
00:37:31.871 --> 00:37:36.030
the artists are so much louder than everybody's mind.
We knew.
Same thing,

689
00:37:36.410 --> 00:37:40.090
same thing as yesterday.
Is there a setting so much lower on this board?

690
00:37:40.090 --> 00:37:43.410
If you could look,
come look at it is better than ours.
I don't know.
I don't know.

691
00:37:43.411 --> 00:37:46.540
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
But so anyway,

692
00:37:46.541 --> 00:37:48.700
so we would draw a bunch of different ones.

693
00:37:48.701 --> 00:37:51.400
So there was like all these kind of like $5 bill,
$10 bill,

694
00:37:51.401 --> 00:37:54.110
$20 they'll have different kind of currency of bullies,

695
00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:58.690
bullies with Dixon talks and stuff like that.
Hilarious.
Yeah.

696
00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:00.910
I wanted to,
I just pitch the travel channel.

697
00:38:00.911 --> 00:38:04.550
They were just trying to think of ways to promote my new show and I thought I

698
00:38:04.551 --> 00:38:06.640
had the most genius idea.
I was like,

699
00:38:06.641 --> 00:38:11.641
what if you made like busts of bust of me like this big right.

700
00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:17.400
Just my boss and like with my mouth open and it fit over urinal mince like

701
00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:21.460
urinal cages.
So you'd put them in urinals all over the country.

702
00:38:21.461 --> 00:38:24.310
Just me with my mouth open so people could pay them because of my mouth.

703
00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:28.420
I was like,
everyone would fucking talk about those.
And like,

704
00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:31.510
I've thought it would like spread like wildfire and they looked at me like I was

705
00:38:31.511 --> 00:38:32.560
out of my fucking mind.

706
00:38:32.590 --> 00:38:36.100
I'm fairly confident that I would never have come up with that.
But

707
00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:38.170
<v 1>if you saw one in a bar,
would you not bring it up?</v>

708
00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:41.920
I would never want anybody pissing in any symbolic mouth of mine because I don't

709
00:38:41.921 --> 00:38:45.040
want to give anybody that idea.
I don't want dudes go,
you have no,

710
00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:46.360
after we pushed it,
his mom,

711
00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:51.120
what's fucking me is my hadn't thought it all the way through possible.
John,

712
00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:55.030
you jerk off in his head and I'm going to shit on his chest.
You know,

713
00:38:55.090 --> 00:38:58.750
I don't want to open up the door for anything.
The grading,
it wasn't flushed out,

714
00:38:58.870 --> 00:39:03.130
but I thought it would be like one of those like marketing geniuses.

715
00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:07.040
<v 3>You would what you would want to give people something that everybody wants and</v>

716
00:39:07.041 --> 00:39:10.070
needs and doesn't really have on them.
Like,
if you want to give them a lighters,

717
00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:10.610
you know,

718
00:39:10.610 --> 00:39:14.000
or something like that would perk to conquer lighters or give them something

719
00:39:14.001 --> 00:39:16.400
that they're gonna use.
So they're going to enjoy the fact that,
oh,

720
00:39:16.401 --> 00:39:19.700
I got this from birth Congo,
like a key chain.
It,
he's a fucking key chain man.

721
00:39:19.701 --> 00:39:22.640
That's silly.
It's just more shit to have in your pocket.

722
00:39:22.641 --> 00:39:26.030
Put Your fucking key in your pocket right now.
But like,
you know,

723
00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:29.250
birth to conquer key chains,
that's not going to come up.
That's not good.
But,

724
00:39:29.330 --> 00:39:33.560
but like maybe a lighter.
No,
especially people who are smokers.
I was,

725
00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:37.340
I told her to print like a thousand stickers and just send them to kids.

726
00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:41.210
That'll then get annoyed if stick their stickers.
Birth the conquered Khan.

727
00:39:41.250 --> 00:39:44.760
He's got his fucking stickers all over my school.
What is that loaded?

728
00:39:44.810 --> 00:39:47.170
What does a thing though that you could use that would really help people

729
00:39:47.210 --> 00:39:50.510
besides like pens and shit like that?
Like what would people in joy,

730
00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:54.080
is there a piece of swag that people would actually be happy to get?

731
00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:57.730
<v 1>Brian,
you're in new,
all that shit.
Yeah.</v>

732
00:39:57.731 --> 00:40:00.460
You know the thing I would think of iPhone cases.

733
00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:02.620
That's not a bad movie because I mean,
I know so many,

734
00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:06.460
so many chicks that have no iPhone case.
I'm like,
dude,
you're so fucking stupid.

735
00:40:06.461 --> 00:40:09.200
You're going to break this.
You know you're going to draw so dope.

736
00:40:09.201 --> 00:40:12.790
But out of case it does look dope at all.
Their excuses.
It's like,
I know.

737
00:40:12.791 --> 00:40:16.420
I just need,
I just needed,
it's pretty stupid that you have to have a case to.

738
00:40:16.421 --> 00:40:18.940
That bothers the shit out of me.
I think that's so dumb.

739
00:40:19.210 --> 00:40:22.890
I had that little rubber bumper on.
I dropped it shattered.
Really?
Yeah.

740
00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:26.020
They'll get the rubber feet.
That's where I got a good fat rubber one.

741
00:40:26.021 --> 00:40:29.890
Now what about,
what about burnt the conqueror,
Ma magnetic wristbands,

742
00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:32.890
all those holograms.
Bullshit,
bullshit bands.

743
00:40:32.891 --> 00:40:34.950
Those things pass mountain people like go fuck this.

744
00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:39.190
I've seen so many high level fighters wearing those things and makes me so sad.

745
00:40:39.550 --> 00:40:43.060
It's like,
why don't you just take a chicken head and wrap that around your neck?

746
00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:46.460
Do some Voodoo.
Yeah,
but it works.
What does that Brian,
he,

747
00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:49.570
this is like a rubber iPhone case that I got the other day from second Japanese

748
00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:53.380
on listening on iTunes.
He's holding up some sort of,
oh,

749
00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:55.840
you just got that for free?
No,
I didn't get it for free,

750
00:40:55.841 --> 00:40:59.500
but I'm just saying if you feel it,
this is like a cheap,
that is a cheap product.

751
00:40:59.501 --> 00:41:01.940
Well how they cost like 30 bucks though,
Dude.
Yeah,

752
00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:05.890
but that much or markup.
If you go to Ebay,

753
00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:08.820
if you go to Amazon you can get like a box of these killings have.

754
00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:11.620
So how much do you think that would cost is?
Probably like a dollar.
Well,

755
00:41:11.621 --> 00:41:13.810
I think probably just the part alone.

756
00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:16.810
I'd probably say like not even a dollar 13 something like that.

757
00:41:16.811 --> 00:41:21.040
So how did you come up with the doctor?
Because it seems more official does,

758
00:41:21.041 --> 00:41:23.110
right?
If you added an extra number in there,

759
00:41:23.170 --> 00:41:26.860
I bet there's a company on the Internet that you can print out your own iPhone

760
00:41:26.861 --> 00:41:30.940
cases.
What about birth?
Congress sunscreen and we'll package the sunscreen.

761
00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:32.110
That's not a bad idea.

762
00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:34.400
As long as you know that it like give you cancer or something.

763
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:37.880
Cause I read some crazy shit about sunscreen actually contributing to cancer and

764
00:41:37.881 --> 00:41:42.320
some people.
Okay,
great.
Yeah,
that's all lather and sunscreen.
I do too,
man.

765
00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:46.340
Fucking,
I have a friend of mine,
he's got skin cancer right now.
Oh,
I had a big,

766
00:41:46.341 --> 00:41:49.500
big chunk of meat removed from his head.
Now how did he leave?

767
00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:51.860
Like itchy or here's the scary thing.

768
00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:55.760
He went to a dermatologist and the dermatologist said nothing.

769
00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:57.710
The dermatologist said,
I don't think you should worry about it.

770
00:41:57.711 --> 00:42:00.980
And then a year later he went to another dermatologist and it turns out skin

771
00:42:00.981 --> 00:42:04.550
cancer and it was pretty deep.
They had a really dig into his head to cut it out.

772
00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:08.660
Wow.
That's scary because I mean I have this one little,
I'm a moly motherfucker.

773
00:42:09.290 --> 00:42:13.250
I have one,
this one mole on my bag.
That always feels so weird.

774
00:42:13.251 --> 00:42:16.500
It's like crusty feeling sometimes and then I went to the dermatologist and

775
00:42:16.501 --> 00:42:18.770
they're like,
oh no,
that's fine.
Here,
look at these pictures.
See that?

776
00:42:18.771 --> 00:42:19.940
That's what you wanted to look out for,

777
00:42:19.941 --> 00:42:23.810
where it looks like red dots and it's like all crazy looking and I'm like,
okay.

778
00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:26.120
But I've always thought,
no,
that's not right.

779
00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:30.390
That's tactile 10th I'm a high bone mass and hypochondriac.
Oh,

780
00:42:30.450 --> 00:42:33.980
I found a fucking ingrown hair on my arm one time and because I just hung out

781
00:42:33.981 --> 00:42:37.670
with Schimmel,
I was like,
I got fucking non Hodgkin's lymphoma.
There's no sports.

782
00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:40.100
Oh my God.
I was in a fucking convince myself.

783
00:42:40.101 --> 00:42:44.290
Whole flight home went straight to the Dr. Chen.
She's looked at it.
She was,

784
00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:47.030
it's an ingrown hair.
Holy Shit Dude.
Check this out.

785
00:42:47.031 --> 00:42:49.790
I had an ingrown hair in my belly button.
Do you remember this?

786
00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:55.650
This is like four or five and this show turn gay or oh my God,

787
00:42:55.670 --> 00:43:00.350
I got to see this.
You have an ingrown toenail.

788
00:43:00.351 --> 00:43:03.470
Anything ingrown that's pissing,
I'm dying to see you.

789
00:43:03.471 --> 00:43:06.670
Don't you haven't typed in Bob,
fly bought fly extractions.

790
00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:12.230
I want one so bad,
but just the idea to pull it out.

791
00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:15.200
Maybe I don't want one.
When I want my wife to get one,
we can pull it out.

792
00:43:15.250 --> 00:43:18.690
All the awesome.
Let me see your,
I know he'll have it now.

793
00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:22.430
This is like four or five years ago and it had a weird puss thing going on son.

794
00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:27.080
You don't go,
you don't do that.
I'll get,
if I get anything like a good pimple.

795
00:43:27.081 --> 00:43:30.260
All my gets swelled up my belly button to the point where you can even put your

796
00:43:30.261 --> 00:43:31.094
finger in it.

797
00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:35.700
And then one day it just filled up with blood and yellow stuff and whites.

798
00:43:36.370 --> 00:43:38.240
Careful about staph infections.

799
00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:41.780
And this is for anybody that listens to the podcast.
Please,

800
00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:45.110
if you have any weird infection on your body that you know,

801
00:43:45.111 --> 00:43:46.850
maybe it's a spider bite,
I don't know what it is.

802
00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:50.720
Go to a fucking doctor and get that checked out because you could fucking die.

803
00:43:50.721 --> 00:43:53.330
Staph infections are scary shit.
Did you guys do,

804
00:43:53.331 --> 00:43:55.910
you probably don't know the comics thins.
Roy Johnson,
he's from Tampa,
right?

805
00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:59.780
So I'm going on Facebook one day and I click on it and the,

806
00:44:00.010 --> 00:44:04.550
and the thing has post his doctors say,
it looks like I'll keep my leg.

807
00:44:04.910 --> 00:44:07.460
And then now I'm like,
what the fuck?
Right.

808
00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:11.810
So I go to his page and I start clicking back older posts to find out like what

809
00:44:11.811 --> 00:44:15.030
happened?
So I'll go back and like two months,
two weeks later,
and,

810
00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:19.340
and it starts like he's at the Dayton funnybone and he's like,
yeah.
So,
um,

811
00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:23.630
I got a weird bite on my leg last night.
Uh,
well I wonder if it's a spider bite.

812
00:44:23.631 --> 00:44:25.490
I'm going to get some calamine lotion next day.

813
00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:27.590
It's getting worse the day after that.
Okay.

814
00:44:27.591 --> 00:44:29.150
This is really starting to concern me.

815
00:44:29.151 --> 00:44:31.980
The day after that I'm having a hard time and like,

816
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:34.470
<v 3>you can see him getting worse and worse and worse.</v>

817
00:44:34.471 --> 00:44:37.650
And then he ends up in a hospital,
he's like,
Dr Sale,
keep my leg.
And I'm like,

818
00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:42.150
Oh fuck.
It's like this guy.
It's like this.
What was it?
I have no idea.

819
00:44:42.151 --> 00:44:43.320
And it must've been Murcia.

820
00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:46.740
It must've been that it that there's a crazy strain of staph.

821
00:44:46.741 --> 00:44:49.020
We talked about the antibiotics,
Brian,

822
00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:52.560
but people not taking their antibiotics and the full dose that doesn't kill the

823
00:44:52.561 --> 00:44:54.190
bacteria and it creates things.

824
00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:59.200
He's antibiotic resistant strains of of infection and staph is one of the

825
00:44:59.521 --> 00:45:04.290
scariest ones,
man.
Oh fuck yeah.
There's ID Eric who apparently has it real bad.

826
00:45:04.350 --> 00:45:07.920
Who the Baywatch Chick Diamond Ericho shut up.
Has she got Marissa?

827
00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:10.700
She got it real bad.
Apparently it was in the news like choosing like,

828
00:45:10.770 --> 00:45:14.220
like really bad shape.
I was worried about that at Barry's bootcamp.

829
00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:17.610
Like give up cause I don't think they clean it well this is what you got to make

830
00:45:17.611 --> 00:45:20.730
sure you know when you ever get any sort of scratch.
There's a,

831
00:45:20.731 --> 00:45:25.170
there's a company called defense soap that has a bunch of different solvents or

832
00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:29.610
solves and all these different things and they're all natural oils that kill and

833
00:45:29.611 --> 00:45:33.200
any look funky and factions,
but any open wound and he opens craft,

834
00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:34.320
you gotta clean that.

835
00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:38.160
That has to be cleaned and you have to make sure you put something on it.

836
00:45:38.430 --> 00:45:41.520
You know this,
these ointments and south,
they're all like natural.

837
00:45:41.521 --> 00:45:45.440
It's all like eucalyptus oil and tea tree oil kills all funky shit.
Yeah.

838
00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:45.660
You know,

839
00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:48.930
just give yourself a fighting chance that dudes run around with like deep

840
00:45:48.931 --> 00:45:49.540
scratches.

841
00:45:49.540 --> 00:45:52.410
They don't do anything about it and something you don't clean it and then it

842
00:45:52.411 --> 00:45:56.480
gets infected.
Like you can't fucking lose your arm like that.

843
00:45:56.550 --> 00:45:57.600
That's no joke man.

844
00:45:57.601 --> 00:46:01.290
I know a dude who got one in his elbow and his elbow was fucked up.

845
00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:05.550
He got it in Jujitsu,
didn't own it,
was hurt him,
didn't do anything for a while.

846
00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:06.990
And by the time you went to a doctor,

847
00:46:06.991 --> 00:46:10.020
you know he's a tough guy as Australian dude.
By the time I went to a doctor,

848
00:46:10.021 --> 00:46:14.130
it's too late and had this giant hole in his arm cause his arm had swollen up.

849
00:46:14.131 --> 00:46:14.640
This,

850
00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:19.640
these monstrous looking thing is twice the size of a normal elbow fuck as fat.

851
00:46:19.770 --> 00:46:20.910
It happened Ari Shaffir too.

852
00:46:20.911 --> 00:46:24.270
Or You got one on his knee and we were playing pool and I saw him limping around

853
00:46:24.271 --> 00:46:27.720
the pool table.
I go,
what the fuck is going on?
And he goes,
I got bit by a spider.

854
00:46:27.721 --> 00:46:30.420
And as soon as he said that to me,
I said,
oh fuck.
You know,

855
00:46:30.421 --> 00:46:33.930
I had had staff once and I was lucky that somebody pointed it out to me.

856
00:46:33.931 --> 00:46:37.030
I didn't know what it was.
I got it really,
really early.
It was just a,

857
00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:40.290
a few pimples on my leg.
And my friend Tate looked at it.
He goes,
dude,

858
00:46:40.291 --> 00:46:42.550
what does that on your leg?
And I go out,
I don't know.
It was,
it's,

859
00:46:42.570 --> 00:46:44.820
it's or something.
He goes,
I think you got staff,
man,

860
00:46:44.821 --> 00:46:47.760
you gotta go get that checked.
That checked out.
And what it is is,
uh,

861
00:46:47.770 --> 00:46:50.460
it's follicular,
follicular Itis,
I forget,

862
00:46:50.461 --> 00:46:52.320
I forget how it's what the official term is,

863
00:46:52.410 --> 00:46:55.830
but when you see likely follicles that are like little infected follicles,

864
00:46:56.010 --> 00:46:58.950
that's the beginning.
That's the beginning of a staph infection.

865
00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:03.030
And it could be nothing.
It could go away or it can get ugly and be nasty.

866
00:47:03.031 --> 00:47:07.650
And Ariz had turned into like this swollen posy looking thing that looked like

867
00:47:07.651 --> 00:47:11.160
he had been bit by something and it was just a rampant staph infection.

868
00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:12.390
How do you get rid of it?
Well,

869
00:47:12.391 --> 00:47:15.900
he had to go on some serious antibiotics and he got it again.

870
00:47:15.901 --> 00:47:19.550
He got staff again like a year later.
How's he getting it?
Like Joseph,

871
00:47:19.770 --> 00:47:22.530
where he got it from Jujitsu.
Okay,
got it.
From Jujitsu.

872
00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:25.890
And that happens in Jujitsu and the way it happens is you're getting scratched

873
00:47:25.891 --> 00:47:30.280
and scraped and you know you're sparring and when you're sparring you're going

874
00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:34.650
<v 1>pretty much full clip on each other and you know you get cuts and you need</v>

875
00:47:34.651 --> 00:47:37.360
scratch on the ground and,
and if you don't wash yourself,

876
00:47:37.361 --> 00:47:38.680
like Ari would just like fucking,

877
00:47:38.970 --> 00:47:41.830
he was just like not take a shower at all even that night.

878
00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:43.880
And he would have like 10 dudes,
rape,

879
00:47:43.881 --> 00:47:47.650
sweat all over him leaking into various holes in his body.

880
00:47:50.290 --> 00:47:51.123
<v 6>That's true.</v>

881
00:47:55.850 --> 00:47:56.630
And

882
00:47:56.630 --> 00:48:00.230
<v 1>bangs chicks in that bed and by the way,
are he changes his sheets.
No bullshit.</v>

883
00:48:00.231 --> 00:48:04.700
Once every six months he went six months without changing the sheets.

884
00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:09.440
No,
I think it was even longer than that because it was like a very long time.

885
00:48:09.441 --> 00:48:13.730
He wonders what,
why the fuck he gets staff?
Yo Dude,

886
00:48:13.731 --> 00:48:18.080
you gotta clean your house.
I love that video of his asshole clam.

887
00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:22.610
Oh my God,
it's the best.
So strengths and defines what hemorroids really are.

888
00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:27.640
Like I didn't know what they bought is your butt's popping out from the inside.

889
00:48:28.611 --> 00:48:30.600
How do you do standup with that in the back of your pants?

890
00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:34.710
How do you show it to everybody and not give a fuck and sit on my wallet and

891
00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:37.880
Hari is already sitting on a golf ball.
I never was comfortable though.

892
00:48:37.881 --> 00:48:39.570
It's like squishy.
It's probably like,
you know,

893
00:48:39.571 --> 00:48:41.540
like those things you put on your end,
you're an air mattress.

894
00:48:42.030 --> 00:48:43.460
The doctor Scholls Yellen,

895
00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:54.490
Kelly donating,
his mind's told it works totally different than lying.

896
00:48:54.491 --> 00:48:56.440
So talking to him about getting home,

897
00:48:56.510 --> 00:48:59.480
smoking weed to get a prescription to for flying.

898
00:48:59.481 --> 00:49:01.860
So I have a terrible fear of flying and he's like,
dude,

899
00:49:01.861 --> 00:49:05.030
you just got to take one of these gel tabs and I'm telling you man,

900
00:49:05.031 --> 00:49:09.080
like him and Ralphie.
Yeah.
Two people that I just don't under a player,

901
00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:11.840
just take two of these.
You don't listen,
don't listen.

902
00:49:12.020 --> 00:49:15.890
They're fucking being dicks.
Like they don't mean to,
but like I just,

903
00:49:15.891 --> 00:49:20.180
I took like half of one and was melted abreast trip.
One of those little things,

904
00:49:20.181 --> 00:49:22.940
if you get ahold of those pit jammies,
those you take a half.

905
00:49:23.580 --> 00:49:25.390
Just don't take your a Oh,
don't eat any.
Yeah.

906
00:49:25.470 --> 00:49:28.040
Don't eat anything if you didn't make it yourself,
man.

907
00:49:28.041 --> 00:49:31.250
It's just too hard to know the dosage.
You've got to regulate that shit.

908
00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:36.200
Not fucking like dudes that work in Intel making microchips fucking lab coats

909
00:49:36.201 --> 00:49:37.260
on.
So asshole,

910
00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:41.630
a tie dye tee shirt and a goofy ponytail and he's throwing some shit into a bowl

911
00:49:41.690 --> 00:49:44.560
and if he's making it,
he clearly has a high tolerance is,

912
00:49:44.570 --> 00:49:47.150
or who am I going to make this two fucking kids.
Exactly.
I,

913
00:49:47.151 --> 00:49:49.430
there's a dude that came to visit us and uh,

914
00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:53.120
he came to visit us at the John Lovitz club and he gave me some shit on me and

915
00:49:53.121 --> 00:49:56.990
Joey after the show,
we both like just sat there and Joey always leaves.

916
00:49:56.991 --> 00:50:01.820
He always lead.
Oh wait,
go out.
If I go on stage,
I know that it's a second show.

917
00:50:01.821 --> 00:50:05.410
By the time I get offstage,
Joey's got,
I got offstage,
I'm saying hi,

918
00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:07.460
a saint by the staff.
Thank you everybody.

919
00:50:07.461 --> 00:50:10.540
Bubba blog gathering all my shit and I see jelly sitting in a chair.
Yeah,

920
00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:14.900
I ain't got a lot of your dog.
I ain't moving.
I moving Joe Rogan.

921
00:50:15.380 --> 00:50:17.810
That's how high and you're not going anywhere either stay here with me.

922
00:50:17.890 --> 00:50:21.590
Cocksucker the whole time he was sitting there watching a jet when you're on

923
00:50:21.591 --> 00:50:26.070
stage sweating like hand going like a thousand miles of no,
just to sweating.

924
00:50:26.150 --> 00:50:27.650
He would look at me and those r's,

925
00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:28.730
<v 3>you know,</v>

926
00:50:28.730 --> 00:50:32.150
he's like looking at you like a deployant being these motherfuckers in their

927
00:50:32.151 --> 00:50:36.110
cookies,
man.
They were too strong.
[inaudible] uh,
they had,
he like these,

928
00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:40.130
what are those called?
Biscottis the guy told me only eat a half our,

929
00:50:40.140 --> 00:50:44.470
he ate a whole one and Joey ate one and a half of them.
Juliet,

930
00:50:44.550 --> 00:50:46.610
one and a half.
The guy says,
eat a half Geragos

931
00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:52.840
I laugh in the face of danger.
He just ate all of it.
Yeah,
no way.

932
00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:56.360
No.
What happens to your brain when you get is getting too high?

933
00:50:56.361 --> 00:51:01.100
Like getting too drunk?
No.
It's when you get really,
really high,

934
00:51:01.101 --> 00:51:05.060
especially if you eat it,
it's a really psychedelic,
it's very,
it's a,

935
00:51:05.061 --> 00:51:09.500
it's really introspective and it really brings up your past and you start

936
00:51:09.501 --> 00:51:12.350
thinking about all kinds of weird shit about your childhood and things that you

937
00:51:12.351 --> 00:51:15.620
did.
You know,
that you're upset that you did to someone when you were like seven.

938
00:51:15.650 --> 00:51:18.620
You know,
you'll,
you,
you just start really tripping out about weird shit.

939
00:51:18.621 --> 00:51:23.210
And it's,
it's much more,
uh,
it's,
it's,
it's like a much deeper,

940
00:51:23.211 --> 00:51:27.740
much more like psychedelic trip than just smoking it.
When you smoke it,

941
00:51:27.741 --> 00:51:30.440
you can get really high.
You get paranoid and get hyper aware.

942
00:51:30.590 --> 00:51:33.860
You start feeling really vulnerable.
We stopped being really sensitive to shit.

943
00:51:34.070 --> 00:51:38.300
But when you eat it,
you start hallucinating.
Especially when you close your eyes,

944
00:51:38.390 --> 00:51:40.730
when you eat it and you close your eyes.
Dude,
I always,
for me,

945
00:51:40.731 --> 00:51:43.970
for whatever reason,
it's cartoons fucking,
that's what I see.

946
00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:48.080
I see these really bizarre alien,
impossible.

947
00:51:48.081 --> 00:51:52.430
Describe cartoons fucking and I can never exactly see what they look like cause

948
00:51:52.431 --> 00:51:55.310
whatever they look like right now is not what they look like a second from now.

949
00:51:55.340 --> 00:51:55.521
Yeah.

950
00:51:55.521 --> 00:52:00.521
Just keep morphing and changing and it's like some sort of these alien cartoons.

951
00:52:00.650 --> 00:52:03.770
Fucking,
that's what I see every time I closed my eyes when I get super big.

952
00:52:03.771 --> 00:52:06.560
That's what I know.
If I've eaten like a pot cookie,
that's what I know.

953
00:52:06.561 --> 00:52:10.280
I'm deep in the terrorist zone.
Really?
Yeah.
You get into that.

954
00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:13.070
That's strange place of,

955
00:52:13.071 --> 00:52:16.100
it's almost feels that you feel like you are now in another dimension.

956
00:52:16.101 --> 00:52:19.700
Like you've entered into an alien world.
You look at the world around you,

957
00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:20.750
the mechanical world,

958
00:52:20.751 --> 00:52:25.070
like airplanes and pilots and stewardesses and cars and trolleys,

959
00:52:25.071 --> 00:52:28.370
and you look at all that shit and the mechanical interfacing and all becomes

960
00:52:28.371 --> 00:52:31.580
like,
you become like super aware of it all and it feels like an alien world.

961
00:52:31.710 --> 00:52:35.330
You can see there's a world all around you that you've totally taken for granted

962
00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:37.490
that is completely bizarre.

963
00:52:37.610 --> 00:52:42.530
The world of you climbing into a metal box with these squishy rubber tires

964
00:52:42.531 --> 00:52:46.370
connected to this hard Pavan that they've created and molded over the earth,

965
00:52:46.371 --> 00:52:48.920
and you're,
you're in this box,
and while this is happening,

966
00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:52.400
the giant fucking nuclear explosion that lights everything up and you're

967
00:52:52.401 --> 00:52:55.940
spinning around and going a million miles an hour through the fucking universe,

968
00:52:56.200 --> 00:53:00.140
it's,
it's just too much,
man.
And you have to compartmentalize your life.

969
00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:04.100
And what pot does is it doesn't let you compartmentalize.
You can't say,
well,

970
00:53:04.101 --> 00:53:07.460
I've got to get the kids to school.
You know,
pop,
pop goes,
yeah,
you do.

971
00:53:07.550 --> 00:53:11.510
But look at what life really is.
Look at space.

972
00:53:11.511 --> 00:53:15.200
It goes on forever.
Inside every galaxy there's a black hole inside.

973
00:53:15.201 --> 00:53:18.380
Every black holes in another universe filled with hundreds of billions of

974
00:53:18.381 --> 00:53:21.440
galaxies,
each with a black hole,
each with another universe,

975
00:53:21.441 --> 00:53:23.630
with hundreds of billions of galaxies.
And the,
the,

976
00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:26.580
the whole massive at all just starts fucking overwhelming

977
00:53:26.580 --> 00:53:30.480
<v 1>you.
That's,
that's,
that's the problem with pot.
That's why people think like,</v>

978
00:53:30.510 --> 00:53:34.320
you know,
people go,
oh,
it makes me paranoid.
You know,
it's,
you should be paranoid.

979
00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:38.160
If you were really smart,
you would realize a,
the shit all ends,

980
00:53:38.310 --> 00:53:38.911
everyone's going to,

981
00:53:38.911 --> 00:53:42.240
it's going to stall for all of us are trying to get me into an anxiety attack.

982
00:53:42.810 --> 00:53:46.790
Jesus Christ.
That's something that we ignore.
You know,

983
00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:49.080
I think we should appreciate the moment,

984
00:53:49.081 --> 00:53:51.120
but we should be aware that it's temporary,
you know,

985
00:53:51.121 --> 00:53:53.070
and to deny it and just to put it in the back,

986
00:53:53.071 --> 00:53:56.100
that's not helping you because then when the pot comes on,
you know,

987
00:53:56.101 --> 00:53:58.920
when you get super paranoid about that,
what you super paranoid about us,

988
00:53:58.921 --> 00:54:00.930
about something you haven't really addressed in your own mind,

989
00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:02.090
you haven't come to grips with it.

990
00:54:02.091 --> 00:54:05.460
It's a real fucking thing that one day you will find out,
is there a god?

991
00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:06.330
Is there a devil?

992
00:54:06.510 --> 00:54:10.170
Is there fucking space aliens that take you away in their crafts,
right?

993
00:54:10.171 --> 00:54:15.171
Or is this one step in an endless cycle of things that you can't even recognize

994
00:54:15.691 --> 00:54:20.130
what the next one is?
It's so bizarre and alien.
This is alien man.
This,

995
00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:22.650
this world that we live in.
If we didn't live in this world,

996
00:54:22.651 --> 00:54:26.280
we were some sort of an empty,
rational objections,
uh,

997
00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:30.090
objective being,
you know,
that was like looking at human culture.

998
00:54:30.091 --> 00:54:33.900
We would say this is that this way to live is the craziest thing ever.

999
00:54:34.050 --> 00:54:37.950
That's why,
that's why if I ever get really rich,

1000
00:54:37.951 --> 00:54:40.290
I'm moving to Idaho,
I'm buying a mountain,

1001
00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:45.500
I'm making a huge rock rock sculpture of myself with paintings of like it's

1002
00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:49.410
carved into the mountain of what I did.
Like real outrageous stories.

1003
00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:54.750
Only thing that's going to be left that is going to go pharaoh,

1004
00:54:54.751 --> 00:54:57.390
Pharaoh crises cause that's all his left men.

1005
00:54:57.420 --> 00:54:59.670
That's all that's left and all the steel crumbles.

1006
00:54:59.790 --> 00:55:03.360
What's going to be me crazy horse and the fucking four presidents and they'll be

1007
00:55:03.361 --> 00:55:06.090
like,
who is this hurt?
How dope is that crazy horse structure?

1008
00:55:06.091 --> 00:55:09.960
They're still working on my thing.
I'll be doing that shit to forever.
Joe.

1009
00:55:10.110 --> 00:55:13.800
Let's do this.
Okay,
I will.
I will spearhead this.
I will quit comedy tomorrow.

1010
00:55:13.830 --> 00:55:15.360
Okay.
I don't know a lot of money.
All,

1011
00:55:15.361 --> 00:55:19.130
I needed to like a bunch of dynamite down and I just want to do you know how to

1012
00:55:19.140 --> 00:55:21.840
do this?
No.
Figure this shit out to figure it out.

1013
00:55:21.841 --> 00:55:23.870
Lewis and Clark made it across the fucking country.

1014
00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:26.820
I've been watching this new show,
I think it's called the wild within.

1015
00:55:27.030 --> 00:55:28.870
It's a new show on the dude.

1016
00:55:29.150 --> 00:55:31.860
I watched it last night for the first time I saw the ads and I started t voting

1017
00:55:31.861 --> 00:55:33.950
it.
Fuck it's awesome man.
Guide.

1018
00:55:33.970 --> 00:55:38.640
And he went to Lewis and Clark way through Montana,
pitbull hunting for fucking,

1019
00:55:38.641 --> 00:55:43.460
uh,
uh,
born next week.
Jesus Christ.
Like old school.
We're taking some pimples.

1020
00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:46.800
Were getting a boar dude.
I had a dog that was trained for that shit.

1021
00:55:46.801 --> 00:55:49.860
I had this Hawaiian pit pole that they used for wild hog hunting.

1022
00:55:50.130 --> 00:55:54.570
Who is crazy frank.
You remember frank?
Frank was crazy.
There was a door.

1023
00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:58.380
I could not stop that door from wanting to attack other animals.
It was bread.

1024
00:55:58.381 --> 00:56:01.430
Just go after hog.
So he was like super,
super aggressive,

1025
00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:05.450
was a tremendous pain in the ass.
Now how's your daughter?
Would the girls,
oh,

1026
00:56:05.460 --> 00:56:09.600
they're great dogs that I have now are very,
like the Johnny,
the big one.

1027
00:56:09.601 --> 00:56:12.870
The mastiff is very calm.
He's,
you know,
he's,

1028
00:56:12.900 --> 00:56:15.090
he was like the guy who bred him,

1029
00:56:15.330 --> 00:56:20.330
bred dogs for fear factor and he really is conscientious about how he mixes
them.

1030
00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:23.830
It make sure that dogs that are aggressive to people or even other dogs,

1031
00:56:23.950 --> 00:56:24.880
they never get to breed.

1032
00:56:25.030 --> 00:56:28.360
So we only breeds the best personalities and he's been doing it for generation

1033
00:56:28.361 --> 00:56:32.410
after generation.
So he really is and he's very proud of it.
So as dogs,

1034
00:56:32.411 --> 00:56:35.590
I'm like the best temperament.
Like I went over his house and his dogs,

1035
00:56:35.591 --> 00:56:39.250
like they're these giant things but they're so calm and friendly and they come

1036
00:56:39.251 --> 00:56:41.830
over to you to check you out and assess and make sure,
okay,

1037
00:56:41.831 --> 00:56:44.280
let me just make sure you're cool.
Okay.
Come on in.
Come on.
And really what?

1038
00:56:44.340 --> 00:56:48.560
I want one of those loud.
Yup.
I wanted an arching Argentinian master.

1039
00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:50.950
Those are crazy.
You've got to be careful of those and why I didn't know.

1040
00:56:51.010 --> 00:56:52.430
And then,
and then I submitted,

1041
00:56:52.450 --> 00:56:56.400
I sent an email to the lady and then she sent back a questionnaire and the idea

1042
00:56:56.410 --> 00:56:59.760
of kids first.
Yeah,
first question,
do you have kids?
And I was like,
yeah,

1043
00:57:00.010 --> 00:57:04.270
second question,
do you plan on sleeping with a dog?
And I was like,

1044
00:57:04.271 --> 00:57:07.300
I don't understand the second bar with them.
You have to buy what it is.

1045
00:57:07.780 --> 00:57:10.930
It's a lot of didn't want before.
Before Mrs Rogan moved in,

1046
00:57:10.931 --> 00:57:15.190
I used to sleep with the dogs really asleep at two pimples on my bed.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1047
00:57:15.460 --> 00:57:18.700
They love it.
They love sleeping with you.
They love you,
man dogs.

1048
00:57:18.730 --> 00:57:21.040
You know when you have a real relationship with dogs like that,

1049
00:57:21.220 --> 00:57:24.490
they really are like the sort of sub human baby that you have.
It's like,

1050
00:57:24.491 --> 00:57:26.650
it's not quite human.
You don't love him as much as that.

1051
00:57:26.651 --> 00:57:31.030
But you know there's an affectionate like loving bond between you and a dog and

1052
00:57:31.031 --> 00:57:33.580
it will ever since you and Callen like la two weeks ago,

1053
00:57:33.590 --> 00:57:37.180
last week said like you were guys were talking about crazy as it that were

1054
00:57:37.181 --> 00:57:38.170
riding horses.

1055
00:57:38.730 --> 00:57:42.730
Like I started looking at animals like just sitting in my house like,
it's weird.

1056
00:57:42.790 --> 00:57:44.710
I got fucking dominion over that bitch.

1057
00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:48.400
What's weird is when they can kill you and they don't know,

1058
00:57:48.700 --> 00:57:51.420
like when you have a pit bull or in my master,
if he could kill me,
I've,

1059
00:57:51.490 --> 00:57:54.190
I've worked with chimpanzees maybe four or five times.

1060
00:57:54.770 --> 00:57:58.000
I had a chimpanzee and adult chimpanzee on my,

1061
00:57:58.060 --> 00:58:01.900
all my shoulders with both ears,
him,
his hands.
Oh No.

1062
00:58:01.930 --> 00:58:06.000
For fucking spike TV.
And I was like making 13 grand an episode.

1063
00:58:06.050 --> 00:58:10.420
My possibility of my nose being bitten off.
A real good possibility.

1064
00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:15.490
I've worked with Jason,
a male,
male chimpanzee are sitting on my neck.

1065
00:58:15.670 --> 00:58:19.900
John the John Morton is one of my,
one of EPA I've worked with a ton of times,

1066
00:58:20.050 --> 00:58:23.140
has a picture of it and he's just got both my ears in his hands.

1067
00:58:23.410 --> 00:58:26.710
I worked with a bear.
[inaudible]
who's a fucking beast.
Like how big?

1068
00:58:27.420 --> 00:58:32.380
Like he was like a seventh grader when he's just seven 4,100 pounds.
Uh,

1069
00:58:32.770 --> 00:58:36.600
yeah.
Me.
Yeah.
So it was sort of an adolescent.
Yeah.

1070
00:58:36.940 --> 00:58:40.090
I'll wrestle a bear one time for that.
Hochberg show,
Dude.

1071
00:58:40.170 --> 00:58:43.030
Thus the fucking scariest thing I've ever done in my life.

1072
00:58:43.060 --> 00:58:46.150
Did you ever see the video of that guy who is a trainer and the bear kills?

1073
00:58:46.151 --> 00:58:49.030
I killed his brother or his cousin.
I think it was his brother.
It's this,

1074
00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:52.690
it might be the same bear I worked with.
Really?
Cause I worked with the bear.

1075
00:58:52.691 --> 00:58:56.950
That was,
it was a movie bear.
She was like the bear that fucking,
uh,
fought.

1076
00:58:56.951 --> 00:58:59.380
Will Ferrell in the movie.
Semi-Pro.
Really?

1077
00:58:59.381 --> 00:59:02.470
I think this is the bear we're talking about.
Dude,
you're killed somebody.

1078
00:59:02.471 --> 00:59:05.470
So they,
hold on.
Let's,
let's find this out real quick because I think,

1079
00:59:05.520 --> 00:59:08.800
I think his name was Bam Bam.
Or it's from Bambam's family.

1080
00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:11.980
One of the bears that we fought that day was named Bam Bam.
I know that.

1081
00:59:12.250 --> 00:59:16.570
But I think that is podcasts.
It's filled with bear.
Semi-Pro bear kills trainer.

1082
00:59:17.170 --> 00:59:20.860
Yeah.
That's the first thing that comes up.
It,
what was the bear's name,

1083
00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:22.040
I think is,
is either

1084
00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:23.810
<v 2>rocky,
rocky and Bam.
Bam.</v>

1085
00:59:23.811 --> 00:59:27.080
Where the massive animal who are named rocky is being put through obedience

1086
00:59:27.081 --> 00:59:28.070
exercises,

1087
00:59:28.730 --> 00:59:32.240
was being put through obedience exercises while he just decided to just bite

1088
00:59:32.241 --> 00:59:34.260
this dude on.
Where's it?
Let me see a picture of where it is.

1089
00:59:35.690 --> 00:59:37.760
That looks like where it was is in California.

1090
00:59:37.980 --> 00:59:42.660
<v 1>Um,
yes.
Yeah.
Big Bear.
Yeah.
We had to drop out.</v>

1091
00:59:42.661 --> 00:59:46.190
We had to drive out to the fucking bear.
This bear killed some.
This we,
it's,
yeah.

1092
00:59:46.230 --> 00:59:47.790
There's only like four bears you can work with.

1093
00:59:47.791 --> 00:59:52.030
It's like fucking black black acts.
So you worked with this murderer bear.

1094
00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:56.680
That was a really good job.
We're going to pass by,
but in that book,

1095
00:59:57.360 --> 01:00:00.330
that's so true.
I wasn't even thinking about it.
I apologize.

1096
01:00:00.900 --> 01:00:03.720
I like how you claimed it though.
You like stop.
Stop.
That was a good line.

1097
01:00:07.140 --> 01:00:11.400
I like that.
So you go to this.
How's Al Sharpton keep getting work?
What the fuck,

1098
01:00:11.401 --> 01:00:13.050
man?
You guys can't do better than that guy.

1099
01:00:13.070 --> 01:00:17.010
That guy's the same as man in America.
No one's killing him.
Oh,
so ridiculous.

1100
01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:19.970
No white supremacy is going to kill him.
They love what he did carry.
So see.
Yeah,

1101
01:00:19.971 --> 01:00:22.140
he's so buffoonish.
She gets into this window's open.

1102
01:00:22.230 --> 01:00:25.410
So chopped and walk by the comedy store one night.
And we were hammered.

1103
01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:27.930
It was me and God,
I forgot.
I think Ari was there.

1104
01:00:27.931 --> 01:00:30.630
Eddie Bravo was definitely there.
And,
uh,
and he,

1105
01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:33.690
he's walking by and as he's walking by like Al Sharpton,

1106
01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:35.140
we all just start yelling.
How,

1107
01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:39.810
how Sharpton's a Pab how shopped in port that mother Fucker,

1108
01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:43.380
everyone's yelling at like five different dudes.
Go get yours out.

1109
01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:45.580
Fuck those dummies.
And No,

1110
01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:48.540
and he's like kind of waving and not knowing how to respond.

1111
01:00:48.541 --> 01:00:51.330
And we're just like letting you know,
we know you're a crook,
but go ahead.

1112
01:00:51.331 --> 01:00:51.840
Go get it.

1113
01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:55.210
<v 2>He did trickier how he got his,
uh,
is the tomorrow broadly style?</v>

1114
01:00:55.400 --> 01:01:00.360
His is relaxed hair relaxed.
No,
he used to look like fucking buckwheat.

1115
01:01:00.510 --> 01:01:04.470
Right.
And then,
uh,
and then,
um,
godfather of soul,

1116
01:01:04.471 --> 01:01:07.910
James Brown was that I can get you a meeting with the president and we can get
a,

1117
01:01:07.930 --> 01:01:09.420
you know,
we'll get in there tomorrow.
I think it was like,

1118
01:01:09.990 --> 01:01:12.660
I want to say it was Nixon or fucking Reagan or Carter.

1119
01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:15.120
James Brown just called the office and was like,
we had a meeting.

1120
01:01:15.180 --> 01:01:17.970
I saw it in the movie,
good hair.
We've got a meeting.
And he goes,
listen,

1121
01:01:18.060 --> 01:01:20.310
I ain't taking you to meet the president if your hair,

1122
01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:25.310
<v 1>he got his hair.
Oh,
the</v>

1123
01:01:25.330 --> 01:01:28.350
<v 2>movie.
Good hair.
Best fucking movie.
I've seen in the longest time,</v>

1124
01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:32.820
you cannot go through TSA and not guess if black women have fucking weaves.

1125
01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:37.350
It makes you reassess black woman entirely.
Best movie.

1126
01:01:37.470 --> 01:01:42.330
So anyway,
so they on hurt Bert.
I'd fucking,
I had,
I had broken my ribs.

1127
01:01:42.331 --> 01:01:46.830
I got mauled by a bull.
Whoa.
Whoa.
What's online?
So online,
just type in hurt.

1128
01:01:46.831 --> 01:01:49.050
Burt Rodeo saw from your show is hurt.
Blurred.

1129
01:01:49.090 --> 01:01:53.220
There's one I did right after the x show where I met you like 10 years ago.

1130
01:01:53.700 --> 01:01:58.380
So stepped on your foot and it hit your side or broke my ribs and broke my foot.

1131
01:01:58.470 --> 01:02:01.800
So school didn't teach me a fucking thing on the show.

1132
01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:05.220
They just bring me in and go.
So today you're going to be a rodeo clown.
I go,

1133
01:02:05.221 --> 01:02:05.791
what do I need to know?

1134
01:02:05.791 --> 01:02:07.860
And then just stay away from the bowl and just let the bull loose.

1135
01:02:07.860 --> 01:02:12.030
Put me in the makeup.
Just fucking broke.
It just mauled me.
And so they're like,

1136
01:02:12.031 --> 01:02:15.300
you're alive.
No,
do you have no fucking idea?
You have no fucking idea.

1137
01:02:15.330 --> 01:02:19.520
Who is responsible for this show?
Mark Cronin,
who is the producer's Cronin,

1138
01:02:19.530 --> 01:02:20.363
the guy who does a,

1139
01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:25.400
he did celebrity reality on VH one nine d 2000.

1140
01:02:25.770 --> 01:02:29.160
Oh.
So they really weren't hip to how dangerous all the shit was.

1141
01:02:29.161 --> 01:02:33.820
It was done through Fox and they were literally like,
I remember them going,
um,

1142
01:02:34.430 --> 01:02:35.131
it's simple.

1143
01:02:35.131 --> 01:02:38.010
We'll just pay him as a contestant and then we'll give him the rest of his money

1144
01:02:38.190 --> 01:02:42.300
for being a producer.
So my eye was covered because you're a contestant.

1145
01:02:42.570 --> 01:02:45.720
Technically I was like,
I was like a reality show contestant.

1146
01:02:45.810 --> 01:02:49.950
So I was covered under that insurance clause and then I was just paid like the

1147
01:02:49.951 --> 01:02:54.750
rest,
like 80% of the money as a producer and executive producer on the show.
Wow.

1148
01:02:54.751 --> 01:02:57.160
So that,
but the idea was it was,
it's,

1149
01:02:57.210 --> 01:02:59.730
you can't sue yourself cause you're a producer.
Right?

1150
01:02:59.731 --> 01:03:04.200
It's your idea and it's the most brilliant show that never took off.
It was,

1151
01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:07.080
it was jack asked me,
he's dirty jobs.
You want to see it,
Joe,

1152
01:03:07.170 --> 01:03:09.540
I would go out and I would do,
I would take dirty,

1153
01:03:09.570 --> 01:03:12.720
I would take dangerous jobs for a day.
So it was a professional football player,

1154
01:03:12.721 --> 01:03:17.610
MMA fighter,
hockey player,
dominatrix games.
You actually have an MMA fight.
No,

1155
01:03:17.611 --> 01:03:20.850
I just fucking fought three Gracie's at once and they just beat me up.

1156
01:03:21.290 --> 01:03:25.470
So that was what I watched that man.
That's uh,
what is like,

1157
01:03:25.471 --> 01:03:27.650
like putting your fucking body on the line like that.

1158
01:03:27.670 --> 01:03:31.410
Although I was young and I was in and I just was like,
and it then,

1159
01:03:31.411 --> 01:03:35.160
that was the theme of entertainment at the time was that like jackass.

1160
01:03:35.190 --> 01:03:39.260
I had done this ass wax and like 2000 that had blown up before jackass.

1161
01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:43.710
It's the funniest thing I've ever done in my entire life.
Cause I swear to God,

1162
01:03:43.711 --> 01:03:47.760
if you're listening to this waxy type in Bert Bert ass wax and it's,

1163
01:03:47.790 --> 01:03:49.920
it's longer cause that's the way segments were made then.

1164
01:03:50.010 --> 01:03:54.810
But it is the funniest thing I've ever done in the funniest.

1165
01:03:54.870 --> 01:03:58.490
Wow.
Like share got ahold of it and started passing around to people and like it

1166
01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:00.210
talks to clip of the year.

1167
01:04:00.270 --> 01:04:03.330
I mean it was like that's the reason I'm going to fucking,
I literally,

1168
01:04:03.331 --> 01:04:05.160
everything I've ever done is just kind of like fallen.

1169
01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:10.050
It happened along as this clip us too long.
But uh,

1170
01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:13.590
so then,
then,
and then we did the bowl thing.

1171
01:04:13.591 --> 01:04:15.960
I broke my ribs and so we had to kind of stay in the city cause I couldn't

1172
01:04:15.961 --> 01:04:18.360
really travel.
And they're like,
so after you broke your ribs,
did you,

1173
01:04:18.361 --> 01:04:21.270
they give you time off,
say,
okay,
heal up and then you go right back at it.

1174
01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:25.710
They gave me no like two weeks and then two weeks and then two weeks off and yet

1175
01:04:25.711 --> 01:04:29.850
broken ribs,
two weeks I just laid in dead on bed.
Rest.
Didn't do anything right,

1176
01:04:29.851 --> 01:04:33.840
but you can't just go back out with broken ribs can you can they can fracture

1177
01:04:33.841 --> 01:04:36.360
and become,
you know,
embedded in your organs.
Yeah.

1178
01:04:36.361 --> 01:04:39.170
We didn't really think a lot of this through God damn dude.

1179
01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:41.490
When I was a football player,
we were doing helmet to helmet contact.

1180
01:04:41.610 --> 01:04:45.280
I basically shot up porn one day when I was the one I was the dominate trick

1181
01:04:45.281 --> 01:04:47.640
camp.
I basically shot a porn.
Really?

1182
01:04:47.670 --> 01:04:50.610
I mean it was naked and this girl was just fucking doing everything she could to

1183
01:04:50.611 --> 01:04:54.780
my junk,
like putting weights on my balls and,
and it was insane.
It was insane.

1184
01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:56.400
It was,
there was,

1185
01:04:56.401 --> 01:04:59.730
it was the wild west of reality television because what was huge at the times,

1186
01:04:59.731 --> 01:05:00.600
fear factor,
right?

1187
01:05:00.810 --> 01:05:03.270
Everyone's eating shit and jumping out and shit and like crazy.

1188
01:05:03.450 --> 01:05:06.720
And so it was this next level stuff where you didn't know you could just host

1189
01:05:06.721 --> 01:05:09.900
something and be charming and people would stick around for that and you just

1190
01:05:09.901 --> 01:05:10.770
had to take it to the next,

1191
01:05:10.771 --> 01:05:14.370
you had to fucking try to bring it and you're competing with that doggy dog like

1192
01:05:14.490 --> 01:05:19.060
jackass.
So he thought,
I mean,
yeah,
it was like Doh,
craziest shit.

1193
01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:21.820
So then the,
the opus,
not the opens,
but like,

1194
01:05:21.821 --> 01:05:23.860
the height of it was towards him when they were like,
Hey,

1195
01:05:23.861 --> 01:05:26.890
do you want to fight a bear?
And I was like,
I was like,

1196
01:05:26.891 --> 01:05:31.090
who does that for a living?
And they're like,
you do on Thursday?
Oh my God.

1197
01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:34.930
Sure enough,
man.
They just took me out and fucking,
dude,
what was that like?

1198
01:05:35.170 --> 01:05:39.970
A ta terrifying cause terrifying because you see the berries totally wild.

1199
01:05:39.971 --> 01:05:43.490
Like he's jumping up and down and there's like a crew there.
And I,

1200
01:05:43.491 --> 01:05:44.261
and I gotten this,

1201
01:05:44.261 --> 01:05:46.540
by this time I realized they don't have a really good and give you shit about my

1202
01:05:46.541 --> 01:05:48.880
safety because I'd already had gotten fucked up by the bull.

1203
01:05:49.030 --> 01:05:52.510
So what they're looking for is the end is to hurt Bert Bert to be heard at the

1204
01:05:52.511 --> 01:05:57.100
end.
So,
um,
so then,
I mean it's,
it's a little bit,
it's a little bit of a bit,

1205
01:05:57.101 --> 01:06:00.100
it's not a bit,
but it's,
the story is a story.
The,
um,

1206
01:06:00.220 --> 01:06:02.890
I get there and the trainers like this how we'll do it.
Um,

1207
01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:06.790
take these and he hands me five marshmallows.
He was on the bears,
not looking,

1208
01:06:06.990 --> 01:06:10.930
take a marshmallow and put in your mouth and then casually walk in front of the

1209
01:06:10.931 --> 01:06:15.680
bear and,
and show him the marshmallow like hall and allow the bear the,

1210
01:06:15.681 --> 01:06:18.820
an opportunity to engage you and take the marshmallow Outta your mouth with his

1211
01:06:18.821 --> 01:06:21.910
mouth.
This way he learned to trust you.
And I'm like,
fuck that.

1212
01:06:22.330 --> 01:06:26.740
Like who needs that trust?
Like money from him.
Oh my God,

1213
01:06:27.290 --> 01:06:30.130
but you don't know any better at the time.
I'm 28 years old,

1214
01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:34.480
maybe 29 and I did it and then he goes,
all right,
we're ready.

1215
01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:35.801
I go,
whoa.

1216
01:06:35.801 --> 01:06:39.580
What the fuck was that like when that bear tongued you felt like you were making

1217
01:06:39.581 --> 01:06:40.450
out with a homeless person?

1218
01:06:40.780 --> 01:06:44.920
Like just fucking bear lips look like a 17 foot woman's vagina.

1219
01:06:45.190 --> 01:06:46.490
Just going ear to Iran.

1220
01:06:46.570 --> 01:06:51.100
You just call horns giant teeth and just tongue right behind the margin when he

1221
01:06:51.101 --> 01:06:55.210
suck out.
Knowing that that bear went and killed somebody after that.
Uh,

1222
01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:55.601
I don't know.

1223
01:06:55.601 --> 01:06:58.510
I think it's probably like the guys who did miss their flight on nine 11.

1224
01:06:58.750 --> 01:07:00.520
Like you don't think about it,
you don't go like,

1225
01:07:00.780 --> 01:07:05.200
cause you'd I didn't die so I'm like you're the appetizer.
Yeah Dude.
But yeah,

1226
01:07:05.201 --> 01:07:08.800
it's the uh,
I mean the entire experience was like terrifying.

1227
01:07:08.801 --> 01:07:11.260
We ended up fighting and then they go,
so look,
if you're in trouble,

1228
01:07:11.261 --> 01:07:13.990
just say marshmallow cause then that's your safe word and we'll get you out

1229
01:07:14.290 --> 01:07:17.950
marshmallow.
Yeah.
And so that fucking farm began the fight.

1230
01:07:17.951 --> 01:07:19.990
I'm like fucking marshmallow marshmallow.

1231
01:07:19.991 --> 01:07:22.300
And they're the bears just throwing me around.
I'm like marshmallow.

1232
01:07:22.450 --> 01:07:25.540
And then the bear put my face in his chest and I couldn't breathe and then,

1233
01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:29.800
and then he spun me doggy style and fucking had me in a bear hug where you're

1234
01:07:29.801 --> 01:07:31.000
like helpless.

1235
01:07:31.030 --> 01:07:33.250
And then I just started looking at the crew and the trainer and I'm like,

1236
01:07:33.430 --> 01:07:35.410
marshmallow,
give me the fuck outta here.
Marshmallow.

1237
01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:38.860
And the trainers like go limp.
I'm like,
please be talking to me right now.

1238
01:07:39.100 --> 01:07:43.630
And not the bear.
There's a bear cock climate marshmallow.

1239
01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:47.500
But yeah,
that's the,
I mean that's technically how it went down.

1240
01:07:47.530 --> 01:07:49.570
So they didn't save,
you know,

1241
01:07:49.571 --> 01:07:54.040
I went lip and slid out the bear and then the bear ended up sitting on my face

1242
01:07:54.370 --> 01:07:55.390
and then my wife,

1243
01:07:55.630 --> 01:07:58.900
they put a marshmallow in her mouth and the bear got off and then they pulled me

1244
01:07:58.901 --> 01:08:02.930
away.
Oh my God.
You let your wife get killed.

1245
01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:07.390
I didn't know where he was still worked up like that.
She did it.

1246
01:08:07.660 --> 01:08:09.970
And then it went into cranes.
Lions that day,

1247
01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:15.010
Tamed Four Lions do fucking Washington.
Elephant.
I mean literally what's,

1248
01:08:15.290 --> 01:08:16.250
wow Herbert

1249
01:08:16.250 --> 01:08:20.870
<v 1>was the probably the greatest show.
No one ever saw God damn dude,</v>

1250
01:08:20.871 --> 01:08:23.990
you're giving me anxiety.
Just listen to these stories.

1251
01:08:24.050 --> 01:08:26.480
<v 7>So why is it somebody with such anxiety?</v>

1252
01:08:26.481 --> 01:08:30.380
It seems like you have a lot of anxiety and stuff that do all these crazy shows.

1253
01:08:30.381 --> 01:08:33.860
Cause you also do a show where you like write the craziest rollercoasters and

1254
01:08:33.950 --> 01:08:36.140
you do all these intense things,
but it seems like you wouldn't,

1255
01:08:36.170 --> 01:08:38.090
it seems like you'd be cooking shows or something.

1256
01:08:38.210 --> 01:08:40.850
<v 1>I don't know.
I don't know why they,
I don't know how I got these jobs.</v>

1257
01:08:40.851 --> 01:08:44.570
Like I just got them like,
but I don't,
I,
you know,
I don't know.

1258
01:08:44.571 --> 01:08:46.940
I don't know why they go to me.
I think.
How did you get the first one?

1259
01:08:47.030 --> 01:08:48.260
I got to get hurt.
Berg.
I go,

1260
01:08:48.330 --> 01:08:52.350
got her books out of the ass wax and then so the ass wax was for,
what the heck?

1261
01:08:52.351 --> 01:08:56.020
Show those for the actual,
yeah.
Okay.
Now I remember the EC show.

1262
01:08:56.040 --> 01:09:00.050
We funniest fucking two minutes of television when Joe was on,

1263
01:09:00.290 --> 01:09:03.170

Jeff Salzman and,

1265
01:09:07.210 --> 01:09:09.920

1266
01:09:09.921 --> 01:09:12.590
they're like,
so here are the questions we are going to ask Joe.
And Gary's like,

1267
01:09:12.591 --> 01:09:14.840

I've known Joe forever.
We're going to be fine.

1268
01:09:14.841 --> 01:09:17.480
We're just gonna go out there and riff.
Do you remember this at all?
Sort of.

1269
01:09:17.540 --> 01:09:18.410
So we go out,

1270
01:09:18.411 --> 01:09:23.411

1271
01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:29.270
I love him like a brother,
but he was the worst host in the world,
the worst.

1272
01:09:29.271 --> 01:09:30.104
So he goes,

1273
01:09:30.290 --> 01:09:33.750
<v 4>all right,

How are you doing Joe?
And you're like,

1275
01:09:36.171 --> 01:09:41.120
And he's like,
oh right.
Oh right.
Yeah.
Okay.

1276
01:09:44.270 --> 01:09:47.930
He just loved it.
And then I was like,
so Joe,
you are doing the MMA thing now?

1277
01:09:47.931 --> 01:09:50.420
And you're like,

And he goes,

1278
01:09:50.421 --> 01:09:54.230
you always been into that and it was so comfortable to do it again.

1279
01:09:54.231 --> 01:09:58.400
You don't remember this at all,
so let's do it again.
So then they go,
okay,
Gary.

1280
01:09:58.401 --> 01:10:01.730
And he's like,
they gave him the questions and he's like,
don't worry.
Don't worry.

1281
01:10:01.731 --> 01:10:04.010
Don't worry.
Fuck no more.
I don't even fucking worry.
I got this,
I got this.

1282
01:10:04.130 --> 01:10:07.580
Come on Joe.
We'll just,
uh,
I'll get you in one of your bits.
Okay.
All right.
Hey,

1283
01:10:07.581 --> 01:10:10.780
we're back.
I'm here with Joe Rogan Jello and then Joe forever.

1284
01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:12.710
Joe I haven't seen in a while.
And you're like,
yeah.
And he's like,

1285
01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:16.960
you've been on the road and you're like,
pretty much.
He's like,

Ah,

1286
01:10:17.390 --> 01:10:19.040
ah,

1287
01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:23.480
And I'm fucking laughing my tits off next to Gary and Gary's like,

1288
01:10:23.700 --> 01:10:27.160
ah,

And then you're like,
then they're like,
take it again.
And then you're like,

1289
01:10:27.350 --> 01:10:30.500
<v 1>as we about this,
as we [inaudible] curious like gay,
that's where we'll go.</v>

1290
01:10:30.501 --> 01:10:32.620
That's where we'll go.
But it ended up being fine.

1291
01:10:32.710 --> 01:10:35.300
I completely forgot about this until you just brought it up.

1292
01:10:35.570 --> 01:10:38.000
This is like an old dusty memory.
I'm going,
I'm like,

1293
01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:41.240
I'm in a corner of an addict right now with a broom going.
Is that what that is?

1294
01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:43.640
Yeah.
How clean that fucking get a flashlight.
You have a flashlight.

1295
01:10:43.700 --> 01:10:47.390
It was so clunky.
That would have been erased forever.

1296
01:10:47.450 --> 01:10:49.970
If you give me like a piece of paper and said,

1297
01:10:49.971 --> 01:10:52.010
describe your appearance on the x show.

1298
01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:54.790
Something really crazy happened with Gary Valentine.
I would've wrote,

1299
01:10:55.100 --> 01:10:56.990
never went on that show.
I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

1300
01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:00.440
Do you have a car?
Is it that online anywhere?
No,

1301
01:11:00.441 --> 01:11:05.010
those were the outtakes that they'll never use.
Show was like a maximum.
It was,

1302
01:11:05.030 --> 01:11:08.600
it was,
they were trying to do like a maxim,
like Maxim magazine,

1303
01:11:08.601 --> 01:11:11.120
sort of a TV show.
They were trying to do hot,

1304
01:11:11.121 --> 01:11:14.400
sexier Mancho wasn't the guy studs,

1305
01:11:14.430 --> 01:11:18.430
<v 2>wasn't he a part of that?
Mark Carlo?
Yes.
He's actually a really cool dude.
He,</v>

1306
01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:20.430
he was,
do you remember studs?
No.

1307
01:11:20.730 --> 01:11:25.730
Studs was a show that was the most ridiculous dating show like ever.

1308
01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:30.710
Oh yes.
And it was like the most arrogant guys and the most co,

1309
01:11:30.730 --> 01:11:33.720
it was like the f one of the first looks into reality TV.

1310
01:11:33.810 --> 01:11:37.680
Probably didn't recognize it because it was a,
it was sort of a,
uh,
uh,
you know,

1311
01:11:37.710 --> 01:11:40.650
a show.
I mean it was like,
you know,
it's a dating show.

1312
01:11:40.651 --> 01:11:43.980
We didn't recognize that it was reality TV.
It was a,
yeah.

1313
01:11:43.981 --> 01:11:45.450
Marked Carla and then he got fired.

1314
01:11:45.630 --> 01:11:50.630
That Guy Justin from like the movie with Alicia Silverstone and you remember

1315
01:11:50.941 --> 01:11:54.600
clueless.
He was the pretty boy.
I don't remember.
Got fired.

1316
01:11:54.630 --> 01:11:57.630
And then John Weber got fire to me and Gary Ballantine abroad on,

1317
01:11:58.110 --> 01:12:00.510
oh that's right.
You guys came in at the very end and we were,

1318
01:12:00.511 --> 01:12:04.170
and that's how I met Stan hope cause it was up between me,
Gary Valentine,
Doug,

1319
01:12:04.171 --> 01:12:06.810
Stan hope and some guys,
Scott Henry.
Wow.

1320
01:12:06.811 --> 01:12:09.900
If you stick around in Hollywood long enough,
man,
you'll have some crazy stories.

1321
01:12:09.930 --> 01:12:11.520
They just accumulate.
I remember,

1322
01:12:11.521 --> 01:12:16.170
I remember going to the Improv one time and Stan hope was on stage and I don't

1323
01:12:16.171 --> 01:12:19.590
know if he saw me or if he didn't,
but he ended up doing like 15 minutes on me,

1324
01:12:19.870 --> 01:12:24.060
like just,
just making fun of like a,
but it was very sad.
It was the show.

1325
01:12:24.140 --> 01:12:27.270
What was it from the show?
The AKC show.
And he goes,

1326
01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:31.800
he was just talking about a shitty show on television that they give to a

1327
01:12:31.801 --> 01:12:36.610
younger comic cause he has some heat generated behind them and do,

1328
01:12:36.710 --> 01:12:40.050
that's what it's like.
But it was like,
it was really funny.

1329
01:12:40.051 --> 01:12:43.710
It was murdering and then I was in the back and I go and I'm sitting there like

1330
01:12:43.711 --> 01:12:47.550
I wonder if he knows I'm here.
And then,
and then at the very end is like,

1331
01:12:47.551 --> 01:12:50.820
don't get me wrong Bert Kreischer you're a nice guy,
I'm sure,

1332
01:12:50.940 --> 01:12:54.960
but I want to see you one week and fucking Iowa when it's snowing and you can't

1333
01:12:54.961 --> 01:12:56.370
leave your hotel and there's only,

1334
01:12:56.371 --> 01:13:00.030
there's only an Arby's d next door to you and you got to fucking drink wine just

1335
01:13:00.031 --> 01:13:02.130
to get through the and like does this whole bit.

1336
01:13:02.220 --> 01:13:04.590
And then I'm in the back of them just like I'm fucking leaving.
Cause I was like,

1337
01:13:04.830 --> 01:13:09.830
so then so then cut to like four by four years later I'm in Sacramento,

1338
01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:11.850
soulless,
empty,

1339
01:13:11.851 --> 01:13:16.530
like in the fucking Taffy district or wherever the fucking places and I eat,

1340
01:13:16.660 --> 01:13:20.700
I'm just empty and I'm drinking a lot and I email Stan hope and I'm like,

1341
01:13:20.730 --> 01:13:22.020
I wonder if I can reach out to the Duke.

1342
01:13:22.021 --> 01:13:23.940
Cause that's comics are all like you'd know each other.

1343
01:13:24.390 --> 01:13:28.140
So I email Stan hope and like 20 minutes later I get a message back long,

1344
01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:31.470
like a long like Oh,
welcome to the quickening.

1345
01:13:33.420 --> 01:13:36.810
And then he just emailed me now and then like how you doing baby girl?

1346
01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:39.480
Stan hope called me up the other day.

1347
01:13:39.481 --> 01:13:44.481
Pie drunk called me in like I tried to like I realized like right when we

1348
01:13:45.631 --> 01:13:47.760
started talking,
you know he wanted to talk,

1349
01:13:47.780 --> 01:13:51.510
I want an to and he got in an altercation which Janeane Garofalo on the green

1350
01:13:51.511 --> 01:13:55.890
room.
Paul prevents his Green Room.
So I wanted to hear like his version up.
Well,

1351
01:13:55.891 --> 01:13:59.250
so turtles do dude off a little.
By the way,
are you really fucking show turn?

1352
01:13:59.300 --> 01:14:02.880
It feels like it's 1993 right?
Oh my gosh.
She looks so good right now.

1353
01:14:02.970 --> 01:14:04.980
We'll go ahead and for real.
Yeah,
she stopped drinking.

1354
01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:08.280
She looks at what you're into you or any of that?
Look at all the choices.

1355
01:14:08.281 --> 01:14:12.440
Maybe I am my West Traci lords in our prime or Juni Grovo.

1356
01:14:12.730 --> 01:14:15.370
<v 3>Whoa,
Laura's fuck.
Definitely going to Jane.
How often though?</v>

1357
01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:19.220
I would've been green in 93 chase him.
Traci Lords.
You don't think it's hot?
Uh,

1358
01:14:19.500 --> 01:14:24.130
no.
I don't know what is wrong.
He used to fuck blonde checks all the time.

1359
01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:26.830
She's got brown hair.
Oh,
I thought she had blonde hair.

1360
01:14:27.730 --> 01:14:31.780
I didn't even notice how the fuck could you wait,
wait,
wait.

1361
01:14:31.781 --> 01:14:34.290
So what happened was Dan open to Garafolo.
Okay.
Um,

1362
01:14:34.291 --> 01:14:39.291
apparently hello on her first set after nine 11 went on stage at the laugh stop

1363
01:14:40.151 --> 01:14:43.930
in Houston.
And according to Stan Hope,
what she said is that you,
you know,

1364
01:14:43.931 --> 01:14:47.410
everybody should just back the fuck off and Noam Chomsky should back the fuck

1365
01:14:47.411 --> 01:14:51.610
off and leave George Bush alarm because this is obviously a crazy situation and

1366
01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:53.500
you know,
and the guys doing the best he can.

1367
01:14:53.590 --> 01:14:57.040
And Stan hope was saying that he was very disappointed because he went to see

1368
01:14:57.041 --> 01:15:01.300
her expecting some like really biting social commentary into Stan hope was doing

1369
01:15:01.301 --> 01:15:05.380
this bit about nine 11 that,
you know,
he's really sticking his neck out there.

1370
01:15:05.530 --> 01:15:09.070
He was like,
you know,
where was your,
I guess your God takes Tuesday off.

1371
01:15:09.071 --> 01:15:11.620
You know who's doing this thing about all these people like praying for God and

1372
01:15:11.621 --> 01:15:14.140
how this,
this came through even in,
you know,

1373
01:15:14.141 --> 01:15:17.460
in spite of all these people that were there,
there's religious fervor,

1374
01:15:17.470 --> 01:15:20.530
any of this big like,
you know,
anti warp thing that he was working on.

1375
01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:22.480
And you know,
he was really into it.

1376
01:15:22.481 --> 01:15:25.920
And so when he went and saw [inaudible] and she's like saying,
you know,

1377
01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:28.450
give George Bush break,
I thought I was not at him.

1378
01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:31.360
So he brought it up on the show.
Apparent fucking love.
Doug Stanhope.

1379
01:15:31.380 --> 01:15:34.960
And I talked to Jamie Kilstein and Kilstein saw it and he gave me his version of

1380
01:15:34.961 --> 01:15:39.280
it.
And then I talked to Doug and I got this fucking version,

1381
01:15:40.090 --> 01:15:42.310
you know,
Doug gave me the drunk man version.

1382
01:15:42.311 --> 01:15:43.960
He was hammered when I talked to him.

1383
01:15:44.410 --> 01:15:46.870
It was a really crazy conversation because Doug and I,

1384
01:15:47.110 --> 01:15:50.050
we have these conversations where,
you know,
we'll like,

1385
01:15:50.260 --> 01:15:55.060
like we'll talk like every few months.
And it's like,
okay,
we're yet,

1386
01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:57.940
what are you thinking about?
And then when we're talking,
it's like,
you know,

1387
01:15:57.970 --> 01:15:59.950
this doesn't make sense and that doesn't make sense.

1388
01:15:59.951 --> 01:16:01.220
And then what happens and you know,

1389
01:16:01.270 --> 01:16:04.270
what's the point and even concentrating on any of this.
Right,
exactly.

1390
01:16:04.271 --> 01:16:07.300
I'm there too and we'll have like these weird conversations,
you know,

1391
01:16:07.301 --> 01:16:10.360
we're just trying to like how much have you been trying to figure out in life in

1392
01:16:10.361 --> 01:16:13.120
the last three months since we last talked.
And then we try to like figure out,

1393
01:16:13.410 --> 01:16:13.720
you know,

1394
01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:17.500
if either one of us has come to any conclusions that make you happy and the

1395
01:16:17.501 --> 01:16:21.970
middle of this,
he goes xy,
anything.
Is there anything that gives you hope,

1396
01:16:23.410 --> 01:16:27.610
anything that gives you hope?
And I was just sitting there going,
wow,

1397
01:16:27.730 --> 01:16:31.060
what a strange conversation.
I'm sober,
completely sober.

1398
01:16:31.270 --> 01:16:35.430
He's fucked up drunk and he's going to just anything that gives you hope,

1399
01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:37.270
maybe he's thinking of a tagline for himself.

1400
01:16:38.170 --> 01:16:42.430
You should have said the fleshlight.
Yeah.
Fucking gives me hope.

1401
01:16:42.431 --> 01:16:46.240
15% off now Goodall website.
No.
What was,
um,

1402
01:16:46.750 --> 01:16:48.910
like when his,
his version of it,

1403
01:16:48.911 --> 01:16:51.580
I mean he just was relaying exactly what he saw and he saw that.

1404
01:16:51.581 --> 01:16:54.250
We thought it was disappointing that she didn't take a stand and he's not

1405
01:16:54.270 --> 01:16:55.170
attacking her.
Just telling her,

1406
01:16:55.270 --> 01:16:58.450
but you know what aren't quite honestly after nine 11 who the fuck knew exactly

1407
01:16:58.451 --> 01:16:59.470
what happened?
And who knows.

1408
01:16:59.471 --> 01:17:03.980
Still I have a real issue with people that want to argue about nine 11 and it's

1409
01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.790
fucking inside job or you know,

1410
01:17:05.810 --> 01:17:08.860
it was just no where the government would have done that either argument where

1411
01:17:08.861 --> 01:17:13.430
you're so God damn shore,
you know that whole thing is just a,
a bunch of puzzles.

1412
01:17:13.430 --> 01:17:14.241
There's a bunch.

1413
01:17:14.241 --> 01:17:17.660
I watched that Jesse Ventura show and I don't know if he's telling the truth or

1414
01:17:17.661 --> 01:17:20.690
if it's real,
but if it is real,
what he said,

1415
01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:23.210
that conspiracy show is fucking terrifying.

1416
01:17:23.530 --> 01:17:27.410
Did Donald Rumsfeld had a press conference the day before the nine 11 attacks

1417
01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:31.010
where they said that some insane amount of money in the trillions was missing

1418
01:17:31.011 --> 01:17:33.230
and they couldn't account for it and they were working on it.

1419
01:17:33.350 --> 01:17:37.850
And then the next day the Pentagon gets hit in the exact same spot where the

1420
01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:40.910
counting offices are.
All that information was stored.

1421
01:17:41.180 --> 01:17:44.420
That's what got hit in the Pentagon and they're talking about trillions of

1422
01:17:44.420 --> 01:17:48.800
dollars that were unaccounted for.
I see.
I have no understanding of that.

1423
01:17:48.820 --> 01:17:51.370
And when,
you know,
it's so abstract to me,
first of all,

1424
01:17:51.371 --> 01:17:53.480
when you start talking about trillions of dollars,
I mean,
I don't even,

1425
01:17:53.810 --> 01:17:56.540
I can't even wrap my head around.
I don't even know what that means.
And then,

1426
01:17:56.570 --> 01:18:00.470
you know,
when you,
you,
you tell me that the money was unaccounted for,
you know,

1427
01:18:00.471 --> 01:18:04.280
and they smashed this,
uh,
you know,
playing into the exact or missile.

1428
01:18:04.281 --> 01:18:07.640
If you listen to some people into the exact offices,
like what does that mean?

1429
01:18:07.641 --> 01:18:10.700
Now they didn't have a backup somewhere.
They didn't back their shit up online,

1430
01:18:10.701 --> 01:18:12.560
all that money.
I don't know what happened to that money.

1431
01:18:12.561 --> 01:18:14.270
So if you don't know what that happened,
that money,

1432
01:18:14.271 --> 01:18:16.910
then this conversation's over because we can't talk until we have any

1433
01:18:16.911 --> 01:18:21.020
information.
But there's so many different things about nine 11 that make you go,

1434
01:18:21.021 --> 01:18:22.970
why did that happen?
Why did this happen?
What,

1435
01:18:23.150 --> 01:18:27.050
what the fuck happened in that tower?
Seven.
You can't say one way or the other.

1436
01:18:27.051 --> 01:18:29.210
You can't say that they did do it.

1437
01:18:29.570 --> 01:18:32.360
You know that the United States government was involved and he can't say they

1438
01:18:32.361 --> 01:18:36.590
weren't involved.
You got to look at it and go,
what,
what did happen?
You would,

1439
01:18:36.650 --> 01:18:40.310
you would have to go back in time and watch it all trans.
You would watch.

1440
01:18:40.540 --> 01:18:43.520
It would have to watch every single aspect of it play out in front of your own

1441
01:18:43.521 --> 01:18:47.500
eyes to really be truly sure.
I believe in some conspiracy.

1442
01:18:47.620 --> 01:18:51.400
I like believe that the flight in hundred conspiracy,
that terrorists,

1443
01:18:51.430 --> 01:18:55.220
he got shot by a missile missile and then Clinton just pimped it and was like

1444
01:18:55.221 --> 01:18:58.340
glue out in the blue up in the middle of the fucking ocean and Clinton's like,

1445
01:18:58.370 --> 01:19:01.850
no,
that was a wiring thing.
Yeah.
Fuck you and all your tries it.

1446
01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:06.110
I believe if there was a way to avoid telling people that are terrorist attack

1447
01:19:06.170 --> 01:19:09.500
at blog that you can affect us.
Yeah,
they do in a heartbeat.
Yeah.
For sure.

1448
01:19:09.501 --> 01:19:11.300
They would do,
would hide that information that would say,

1449
01:19:11.301 --> 01:19:14.600
well there's an engine malfunction and that's it.
You know,
there's,

1450
01:19:14.720 --> 01:19:17.110
if they could find a way to avoid any,

1451
01:19:17.111 --> 01:19:19.700
any sort of information getting out like that,
because first of all,

1452
01:19:19.790 --> 01:19:22.820
people are going to freak out about something that most likely with 300 million

1453
01:19:22.821 --> 01:19:25.400
people in this country,
most likely is not going to affect you.

1454
01:19:25.580 --> 01:19:27.350
It's an isolated incidents.
And by the way,

1455
01:19:27.351 --> 01:19:29.270
we're immune to those isolated incidents,

1456
01:19:29.420 --> 01:19:32.480
but they happen every fucking day all over the world.

1457
01:19:32.570 --> 01:19:36.200
And these places where we're supposed to be liberating,
you know,
I mean in Iraq,

1458
01:19:36.201 --> 01:19:39.740
fucking buildings just get hit by missiles.
Woopsies you didn't we,

1459
01:19:39.741 --> 01:19:43.700
we didn't mean shoot this building,
but we did,
you know,
sorry everyone who died,

1460
01:19:43.820 --> 01:19:47.090
you know,
I mean that shit is commonplace all outside of the world.

1461
01:19:47.420 --> 01:19:50.130
But if the United States government can keep us from recognizing that and just

1462
01:19:50.390 --> 01:19:52.640
they would do it,
I don't think they would do it,
do it,
do it,
do it.

1463
01:19:52.641 --> 01:19:56.580
And they would think they were doing us a favor.
No.
What?
STANDUPS US stand up.

1464
01:19:56.581 --> 01:20:01.330
Stand up like these days it's angry and dark and twisted and you know,

1465
01:20:01.340 --> 01:20:04.520
resolved.
And only do I want to,
fuck.
That's what it is.

1466
01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:07.890
I want to do a show called,
um,
uh,
comedy intervention.

1467
01:20:08.450 --> 01:20:12.330
<v 2>What do you take a guy like Stan hope and go,
look,
here's what we're gonna do.</v>

1468
01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:16.470
Okay,
we're gonna,
we're gonna have like eight comics that he likes.

1469
01:20:16.471 --> 01:20:20.220
We're going to go through and we're going to make you a one hour special that

1470
01:20:20.221 --> 01:20:23.280
you can sell on DVD.
It's going to be clean and you're going to sell,

1471
01:20:23.340 --> 01:20:26.940
make $20 million and then you can do whatever you want and you can have a trust

1472
01:20:26.941 --> 01:20:28.350
fund for the rest of your fucking life.

1473
01:20:28.760 --> 01:20:31.320
Cause I bet if he spent some time just going through what,

1474
01:20:31.480 --> 01:20:36.420
what would be buying Regan's setlist I bet his fucking v like if he had a kid

1475
01:20:36.540 --> 01:20:39.690
all this like this.
When you had your kids,
did your,
did your

1476
01:20:41.580 --> 01:20:43.620
first,
when you first do you go,
fuck,

1477
01:20:43.710 --> 01:20:46.650
I'm noticing a lot of this shit everyone else noticed,
but then

1478
01:20:46.770 --> 01:20:49.410
<v 3>no,
I didn't,
didn't think that.
Um,</v>

1479
01:20:49.411 --> 01:20:51.990
I mean there's definitely going to be things that you noticed that other people

1480
01:20:51.991 --> 01:20:55.380
have already talked about.
But I just said till this day still,

1481
01:20:55.381 --> 01:20:58.110
like when I had a little conversation with my daughter this morning and it's

1482
01:20:58.111 --> 01:21:01.710
like I'm on drugs.
You had a conversation with your dog daughter.
Oh my God.

1483
01:21:03.850 --> 01:21:08.760
I'm like a
fucking when those commercials,
um,

1484
01:21:08.820 --> 01:21:11.410
I had a conversation with my daughter this morning.
I went to the,
um,

1485
01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:15.820
the store and I got bagels.
She loves,
she loves locks,
you know,
like salmon.
Yeah.

1486
01:21:16.090 --> 01:21:16.923
And so,
uh,

1487
01:21:16.950 --> 01:21:21.000
we're eating bagels and lox and I'm having this little conversation with her.

1488
01:21:21.180 --> 01:21:26.040
She's like,
I love salmon.
It's so yummy,
is a really yummy.
It is.

1489
01:21:26.041 --> 01:21:29.970
Okay.
I would like some more and we're having this little conversation.

1490
01:21:29.971 --> 01:21:33.890
I'm looking at this incredibly cute little two and a half year old person who's

1491
01:21:33.900 --> 01:21:38.790
talking to me that I am just,
I love more than anybody I've ever loved ever.

1492
01:21:38.790 --> 01:21:41.640
And I'm having this weird little conversation with her about salmon.
Like,

1493
01:21:41.641 --> 01:21:45.270
do you want some more daddy?
I want some more.
I am not quite filled up.

1494
01:21:45.630 --> 01:21:48.780
And she starts laughing and she like rubs her tummy.
And then,
you know,

1495
01:21:48.781 --> 01:21:52.500
I gave her some oranges or their new shows and she tries to make me laugh and

1496
01:21:52.501 --> 01:21:56.160
she,
and it's like,
it's surreal.
It doesn't even seem real.
It's,
I,

1497
01:21:56.310 --> 01:21:59.580
I always explain children too.
People don't have children.
I'm like,

1498
01:21:59.581 --> 01:22:02.130
it's just like mushrooms.
If you haven't done mushrooms,

1499
01:22:02.131 --> 01:22:05.220
you really don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
You can't say,
you know,

1500
01:22:05.221 --> 01:22:07.890
that doesn't do any good for you.
And it's just an escape.

1501
01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:10.770
Like if you ever done it,
if you've done it and you have that opinion,

1502
01:22:10.860 --> 01:22:12.110
then I would like to talk to you about it.

1503
01:22:12.111 --> 01:22:14.460
Cause I think it's strange that you would have that opinion if you've actually

1504
01:22:14.461 --> 01:22:17.940
done much.
Yes.
It,
same thing with children.
You know,
people say,
you know,
you know,

1505
01:22:17.941 --> 01:22:21.990
uh,
yeah,
it's just a fucking,
just a bunch of fucking souls and you know,

1506
01:22:22.020 --> 01:22:26.640
no big deal,
man,
get over it.
You say that.
But it's love.

1507
01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:31.180
It's love in the purest form and most of the time you're dealing with douchebags

1508
01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:34.590
in life and it's very difficult to be open and loving all the time and did to

1509
01:22:34.591 --> 01:22:38.480
really just put out only positive energy or you feel like people walk over you

1510
01:22:38.490 --> 01:22:41.010
experiences with that you had when you were growing up getting bullied.

1511
01:22:41.011 --> 01:22:42.710
And I had,
everybody has,
you know,

1512
01:22:42.711 --> 01:22:44.850
it's very difficult to like put out love like that.

1513
01:22:44.851 --> 01:22:49.851
So it's easy to dismiss it when you have an absolute pure form of for like a

1514
01:22:50.341 --> 01:22:54.030
baby that you're raising people who don't have them don't understand.

1515
01:22:54.110 --> 01:22:58.210
<v 2>It's like being a born again Christian sort of,
I guess like the,</v>

1516
01:22:58.250 --> 01:23:01.190
and you're almost like,
you almost have this look to your friends,
like don't,

1517
01:23:01.250 --> 01:23:03.190
don't worry.
When you get saved,
you'll figure it out.
So

1518
01:23:03.230 --> 01:23:05.090
<v 3>all SORTA,
but it's also a tremendous,</v>

1519
01:23:05.890 --> 01:23:10.390
where I just felt like a massive growth and maturity and you know,

1520
01:23:10.391 --> 01:23:14.950
and pragmatic way of looking at things just just kicked in flux seven gears

1521
01:23:14.951 --> 01:23:17.770
higher,
you know,
I started working harder.
I started,
you know,

1522
01:23:17.771 --> 01:23:21.280
being focusing more on certain Chet,
look,
you know,
it's,

1523
01:23:21.281 --> 01:23:24.820
it's an evolutionary stage.
I really believe that just like,
you know,

1524
01:23:24.821 --> 01:23:28.270
when a healthy bird leave the nest,
you know,
that's like,
you know,

1525
01:23:28.271 --> 01:23:31.030
you talk to kids that are like 30,
that's still live at home,
they're fucked up.

1526
01:23:31.060 --> 01:23:32.230
You know,
there's something wrong with them.

1527
01:23:32.410 --> 01:23:35.770
They never really went out and did their own shed and they never really became

1528
01:23:35.771 --> 01:23:37.780
adults.
They,
they're stuck in this,
you know,

1529
01:23:37.781 --> 01:23:40.660
this a salamander stage where they never quite,
you know,

1530
01:23:40.750 --> 01:23:44.020
blossomed into the mature animal.
And so,
uh,

1531
01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:46.360
when I see that,
you know,
I just,

1532
01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:50.200
I think that having children is an,
is another stage like that.

1533
01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:53.590
I'm not saying that everyone should have children.
Oh No,
definitely not.

1534
01:23:53.620 --> 01:23:56.580
Or that having children is going to definitely evolve your,

1535
01:23:56.620 --> 01:23:58.150
that you need to do it to evolve.

1536
01:23:58.151 --> 01:24:01.090
I'm not saying that some people end up dropping the kids in the tub.
Fuck yeah,

1537
01:24:01.091 --> 01:24:03.490
they do.
Yeah.
There's some crazy assholes out there.
And not only that,

1538
01:24:03.491 --> 01:24:06.730
sometimes to get involved with someone who's like really detrimental to you,

1539
01:24:06.731 --> 01:24:09.670
but you like to fuck them and all of a sudden you have a baby with that person

1540
01:24:09.671 --> 01:24:12.080
and now you have this incredibly chaotic relationship.

1541
01:24:12.081 --> 01:24:15.820
But they tried to keep the baby from you to him to manipulate you.
And you know,

1542
01:24:16.130 --> 01:24:20.410
things can get really ugly.
But for me at least,
I think having,

1543
01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:24.580
having a child kicked my,
my,
just my whole being into another level.

1544
01:24:24.670 --> 01:24:25.031
<v 2>Well,
it was,</v>

1545
01:24:25.031 --> 01:24:28.720
I went from being a guy who hung out at the Hollywood improv drinking until the

1546
01:24:28.721 --> 01:24:33.280
bar closed to literally the week my daughter was born,
being on the road,

1547
01:24:33.370 --> 01:24:35.440
every single fucking weak,

1548
01:24:35.680 --> 01:24:38.440
like taken feature sets for no money.

1549
01:24:38.470 --> 01:24:42.340
Like just cause I knew that I'd get better and better and my really ambitious

1550
01:24:42.370 --> 01:24:44.900
just horrifically.
And now I'm now I'm on the place,

1551
01:24:44.901 --> 01:24:46.660
so I think I'm traveling like 50 weeks this year.

1552
01:24:47.260 --> 01:24:50.500
Just bring your kids with your wife.
With Uni kid.
Yeah.
I'm gonna take them to,

1553
01:24:50.501 --> 01:24:54.520
I'm going to,
uh,
doing a trip to Indianapolis,
Arizona,
and then Cancun.

1554
01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:56.680
But it's for the bird,
the conqueror.

1555
01:24:56.770 --> 01:24:59.950
So we'll go to like the greatest theme parks.
So I'll take them.
Oh that's great.

1556
01:24:59.951 --> 01:25:01.990
And we'll take them,
we'll just spend the day at a theme park and they,

1557
01:25:01.991 --> 01:25:06.340
and they are,
have like a,
an escort and they can just go do whatever they want.

1558
01:25:06.550 --> 01:25:08.950
So now it's,
it's,
it's turning out,

1559
01:25:08.951 --> 01:25:10.930
I think this summer we're going to do it pretty heavily.
What,

1560
01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:13.930
has there been any of these rides that were the worst?

1561
01:25:13.931 --> 01:25:16.780
Like what's the most craziest one you went to?
Um,

1562
01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:21.760
I think the stratosphere really fucked my head up last night,
man.

1563
01:25:21.761 --> 01:25:25.630
I was like bad the night before I was throwing up in a bathtub and like call my

1564
01:25:25.631 --> 01:25:28.780
wife and told her I was running the desert and was like,
I'm fucking out.
I'm not,

1565
01:25:28.810 --> 01:25:31.450
don't,
I'm going to get sued for this production costs.

1566
01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:34.450
Cause I'm not going to do it.
But don't tell you where that scared of it.

1567
01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:38.210
After food and on a bull or after you've been a tight,
once you've been,

1568
01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:40.670
once heights is a different thing then heights,

1569
01:25:40.890 --> 01:25:44.120
it shuts your brain down to your fingers.
You're moving so fascinating.

1570
01:25:44.140 --> 01:25:45.640
You're like,
as I'm talking about,

1571
01:25:45.641 --> 01:25:48.640
I'm getting my ass just started sweating like at second I talk about it cause

1572
01:25:48.641 --> 01:25:50.620
you get you,
it knocks your stomach out.

1573
01:25:50.620 --> 01:25:53.830
I mean I can't even look at the videos online of people on like those Russian

1574
01:25:53.831 --> 01:25:57.300
kids climbing on the tower.
We talked about fucking my asshole starts tank.

1575
01:25:57.301 --> 01:25:59.950
Oh my God,
it's so hard to watch.
I told them,
I told the man in my mind,

1576
01:25:59.951 --> 01:26:00.401
my wife's like,

1577
01:26:00.401 --> 01:26:04.340
just tell the producers you can't do it and just be a man about it.

1578
01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:06.950
So I called this Guy Dan Adler that morning and I was like,

1579
01:26:06.951 --> 01:26:10.970
and I hadn't slept and had been drinking and it was a bad scene.
I was a wreck.

1580
01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:14.060
I was a real fucking like rec.
And I was like,
dude,
I can't do it.

1581
01:26:14.090 --> 01:26:17.600
It's not going to happen today.
And he was like,
that's fine.
That's totally cool.

1582
01:26:17.601 --> 01:26:20.240
I get that.
But here's the deal.
If you're not going to do it,

1583
01:26:20.270 --> 01:26:23.660
I need you to not do it on the edge of the building.

1584
01:26:23.930 --> 01:26:26.810
Like I need you to get all the way to that moment.

1585
01:26:27.020 --> 01:26:30.680
And then back off and I was like,
and he goes in,
you do not have to do it.

1586
01:26:30.710 --> 01:26:33.380
I could,
but I can make a show out of that.
I can't make a show if you just go,

1587
01:26:33.381 --> 01:26:36.620
I'm not doing it.
So it was like,
okay.
So I went through the whole thing,

1588
01:26:36.650 --> 01:26:41.120
did the training,
got the jumpsuit on,
did all my interviews,
got up to the top,

1589
01:26:41.121 --> 01:26:43.220
started doing my reads and my camera man,

1590
01:26:43.221 --> 01:26:46.130
this Scott Scott Sands is a hanging off the building,

1591
01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:49.160
literally tethered in and hanging off the building where the camera fearless

1592
01:26:49.161 --> 01:26:53.960
mother fucker.
This guy fucking loves that shit and he's videotaping my,

1593
01:26:53.990 --> 01:26:57.260
he's taping my reads and I'm on the edge and I'm fucking my,

1594
01:26:57.510 --> 01:27:01.370
I've pissed my pants a little at this moment.
Like it's just bad.

1595
01:27:01.370 --> 01:27:05.900
It's a bad scene.
And Scott starts laughing and I go,
what?
And he's like,
you know,

1596
01:27:05.901 --> 01:27:09.530
there's like 400 people at the bottom waiting for you to jump.
And I was like,

1597
01:27:09.531 --> 01:27:12.980
and he's like,
there's like 200 behind you right now.
He was,
dude,

1598
01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:17.540
it's going to be much easier to jump.
And they did tell 600 people and the mayor,

1599
01:27:17.541 --> 01:27:20.480
who's waiting for you with a shot of Tequila that you're not jumping.

1600
01:27:20.481 --> 01:27:22.970
So it was the first person did it make know is waiting for you in the shot?

1601
01:27:22.971 --> 01:27:25.520
I was.
I was the first person to jump on the ride.

1602
01:27:25.700 --> 01:27:29.000
I was loop the first guy to do it.
So I was like shit.
And he was like,

1603
01:27:29.030 --> 01:27:33.740
I just jumped man.
It's 16 seconds and then it'll be over 60 seconds so long.

1604
01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:38.120
It's a fucking three fall for 16 1716 seconds.
16 seconds.
This is your free fall.

1605
01:27:38.150 --> 01:27:42.080
You just don't right now.
And right now you're going right now you're thinking,

1606
01:27:42.081 --> 01:27:43.940
well the ride works,
but then you're thinking,
man,

1607
01:27:43.941 --> 01:27:47.390
this is really freaking the fuck out.
This is really fucking annoying.
I bought,

1608
01:27:47.410 --> 01:27:51.650
I'm like,
and you're looking at a target below.
Oh my God.
Still not even time.

1609
01:27:51.680 --> 01:27:54.530
You're about eight stadium stories and right now you're fine.

1610
01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:58.290
You're 40 stories away.
You still haven't landed.
Did he,
did he shoot yourself?

1611
01:27:59.450 --> 01:28:02.720
Explain the ride to me cause I don't know.
It's,
it's controlled descent.
So you,

1612
01:28:02.721 --> 01:28:06.090
they took you in on a seven point harness to an end.

1613
01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:10.760
They basically a big fishing reel and so you jump and you fall and that,

1614
01:28:10.820 --> 01:28:14.540
that tether,
make sure you don't run into the building or like a,

1615
01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:17.990
or like swing out of basically keeps you in one kind of area so you can land on

1616
01:28:17.991 --> 01:28:22.070
the target.
But what if it gets windy that it was very windy my day,

1617
01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:26.660
as a matter of fact,
they do it by gusts.
So it's gusts of like 45 miles per hour,

1618
01:28:26.690 --> 01:28:30.200
right?
So it's a win nominal.
So anytime a wind gust hits 45 miles a hour,

1619
01:28:30.201 --> 01:28:33.350
they shut the ride down for 15 minutes and then they wait for the wind gust to

1620
01:28:33.351 --> 01:28:36.140
go back down.
And my day they were just peaking.
But they were like,

1621
01:28:36.370 --> 01:28:39.620
damn fucking a hundred people waiting to do it and they needed open the ride and

1622
01:28:39.621 --> 01:28:42.710
you can,
you can see that they're just like,
ignore it,
ignore it,
ignore it.

1623
01:28:43.010 --> 01:28:47.030
So then I'm just a fucking,
and I've got my producer,
Lonnie,

1624
01:28:47.031 --> 01:28:49.730
is like in the background with my script going like,

1625
01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:53.460
I need you to say I'm here in Las Vegas on the top of this drab.
There's like,

1626
01:28:53.570 --> 01:28:56.870
and I'm like,
and I just start going,
fuck you lami.
Fuck you.
Fuck you.

1627
01:28:56.930 --> 01:28:59.540
You can fuck yourself.
I'm fucking jumping right now.
And she's like,
Birkdale job.

1628
01:28:59.541 --> 01:29:01.260
And I'm like,
fuck everyone a fucking jumping.

1629
01:29:01.261 --> 01:29:04.860
And now I know they can't use any of acts.
You can't use cursing.
Right?

1630
01:29:04.920 --> 01:29:08.250
And so then I'm like,
and then I'm like,
I don't let him calm down.
I'm like,
okay,

1631
01:29:08.280 --> 01:29:10.710
seriously,
I'm gonna jump k here.
And they just use that me jumping.

1632
01:29:10.711 --> 01:29:14.820
So then we do it.
My land,
I have a religious moment.
I start crying,

1633
01:29:15.030 --> 01:29:16.830
I take a shot and I'm just like,
I'm alive.

1634
01:29:16.980 --> 01:29:21.870
There's no better feeling in the world than surviving a fucking 110 story.

1635
01:29:21.871 --> 01:29:26.871
John 110 stories up to 110 stories is the height of the Sears tower.

1636
01:29:28.050 --> 01:29:32.110
Think about standing on the edge of the Sears tower and then I get down.
I do it.

1637
01:29:32.111 --> 01:29:34.740
I'm like fuck.
And they're like,
they're like,
can you do it again?
And I was like,

1638
01:29:34.741 --> 01:29:38.520
no,
I'm not.
I'm done.
So then like two weeks later they're like,
listen,

1639
01:29:38.521 --> 01:29:41.880
we didn't get any of your fucking reads.
I was like,
what?
And I'm like,

1640
01:29:41.881 --> 01:29:42.900
we can get in your neat breeds.

1641
01:29:42.901 --> 01:29:47.280
We need to send you back to Vegas to like do pickups because there was a lot of

1642
01:29:47.281 --> 01:29:50.940
shit cause you were so fucked up that we didn't get.
So I was like,
okay.
So they,

1643
01:29:50.970 --> 01:29:52.230
we have to reshoot the episode,

1644
01:29:52.231 --> 01:29:55.470
but we're just basically everything about the job,
everything about the jumps,

1645
01:29:55.471 --> 01:29:57.750
what they're telling me.
So then we get up to the top,

1646
01:29:58.900 --> 01:30:02.640
this is going and they're like,
and my buddy Scott sands goes,
look dude,

1647
01:30:02.970 --> 01:30:07.440
I put in for like a fucking hundred and $20,000 Lens.

1648
01:30:07.710 --> 01:30:10.860
I'm going to sit a mile from you,
but I'm going to shoot you from a mile.

1649
01:30:11.190 --> 01:30:15.000
And if you jump it's going to look sick.
And I was like,
Scott,
I'm not jumping.

1650
01:30:15.001 --> 01:30:17.070
And he goes,
I'm just saying,
man,
it's your show.

1651
01:30:17.071 --> 01:30:20.160
Do you want it to get picked up for a second season?
It's going to look sick.

1652
01:30:20.490 --> 01:30:22.910
So then I was like,
fuck.
So I get up to the top and a no,

1653
01:30:22.911 --> 01:30:24.120
I'm not jumping up knowing much,
not jumping,

1654
01:30:24.450 --> 01:30:26.940
and they get to the top and I realized standing on the edge,

1655
01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:31.290
it's easier to jump into walk away from it.
So I was like,
fuck it.

1656
01:30:31.291 --> 01:30:33.000
And I just jumped again.

1657
01:30:33.060 --> 01:30:36.300
Had the same religious moment you get done at the bottom.
It's not religious.

1658
01:30:36.301 --> 01:30:39.880
It's like a spiritual awakening where you're like,
I'm fucking alive.
My,

1659
01:30:39.950 --> 01:30:42.990
I'm to hug my kids.
Like,
oh,
they just called,

1660
01:30:42.991 --> 01:30:46.890
they called me two weeks ago and they're like the Navajo Bridge and Arizona,

1661
01:30:46.980 --> 01:30:50.820
the woman,
he jump off it and do a bungee jump.
It's like 500 feet.

1662
01:30:50.860 --> 01:30:53.670
It's pretty gangster for a bungee jump.

1663
01:30:54.930 --> 01:30:59.710
500 feet is really high free fall for 400.
Freefall.

1664
01:30:59.790 --> 01:31:04.650
Bungee does style.
So I'm looking for take,
uh,
probably play eight seconds.

1665
01:31:06.030 --> 01:31:10.320
And the,
and the,
and the real pimp part is you don't jump for dudes,
lift you up.

1666
01:31:10.321 --> 01:31:14.370
Like you're on a boat and they just throw you off.
Oh my God.
So you're fucking,

1667
01:31:14.371 --> 01:31:15.870
you feel out of control.

1668
01:31:16.140 --> 01:31:18.990
And I'm looking for a celebrity to do it with because I don't want to do it by

1669
01:31:18.991 --> 01:31:22.740
myself.
Show get the fuck out of here and straighten your back up right away.

1670
01:31:23.830 --> 01:31:27.730
You'd never do that.
No.
Really none of that.
I'm not,

1671
01:31:27.980 --> 01:31:30.000
I'm not either,
but like I'm doing,

1672
01:31:30.001 --> 01:31:34.470
running into tricking my brain and thinking I'm almost dying.
I get it.

1673
01:31:34.650 --> 01:31:37.890
I get it.
It looks like fun.
I don't need that kind of stress in my life.
I've,

1674
01:31:37.990 --> 01:31:41.190
it's all my life's filled with right now.
It's crazy,
man.
That's something that,

1675
01:31:41.191 --> 01:31:43.140
that much money like he's like,

1676
01:31:43.200 --> 01:31:46.020
well is it helping your gigs though should be helped.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1677
01:31:46.021 --> 01:31:50.340
I sold out at five shows in DC this week and like it's,
it's,
but it's,

1678
01:31:50.580 --> 01:31:53.240
it's family friendly audiences so you,

1679
01:31:53.370 --> 01:31:57.240
you just have to train them to do,
to watch what you watch.
You did it.

1680
01:31:57.270 --> 01:32:00.100
Was that something you were saying too?
Yeah,
that's what you're saying.

1681
01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:02.410
<v 3>When you were talking about a comedy intervention,</v>

1682
01:32:02.411 --> 01:32:05.770
like getting someone in and taking someone and making them super clean and

1683
01:32:05.800 --> 01:32:08.970
realizing there's so much money out there and that,
but if you didn't have to,

1684
01:32:09.180 --> 01:32:12.130
I couldn't just clean.
Yeah.
And the guy looked stand hope couldn't do it either.

1685
01:32:12.131 --> 01:32:14.080
It wouldn't be fun anymore.
It wouldn't be the same thing.

1686
01:32:14.081 --> 01:32:16.030
It would be all of a sudden there's a job that you can do what?

1687
01:32:16.031 --> 01:32:18.300
You can make money,
but you're not going to be really doing standup anyway.

1688
01:32:18.470 --> 01:32:21.330
<v 2>You're not gonna be doing what your brain will be thinking the way it normally</v>

1689
01:32:21.331 --> 01:32:22.290
thinks when you're on stage.

1690
01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:25.440
Or I feel like my brain is just juggling thoughts to me like,
Huh,

1691
01:32:25.620 --> 01:32:29.800
<v 3>Ooh,
this would be good.
It can't do that.
If you're saying no,
can't go there.
Nope.</v>

1692
01:32:29.820 --> 01:32:32.670
Can't go here.
No.
Can't say that.
Be careful when you say this.

1693
01:32:32.890 --> 01:32:36.120
You don't want to offend any sponsors.
So when you do stand up now,

1694
01:32:36.420 --> 01:32:39.290
when you were saying that you get them to like what you like,
you know,

1695
01:32:39.300 --> 01:32:42.060
or get them to know what you do.
Uh,
start,
uh,
start,

1696
01:32:42.170 --> 01:32:45.530
<v 2>uh,
about my kids.
Like I'll start that mean they're not good.</v>

1697
01:32:45.710 --> 01:32:47.450
They're not by any stretch of the means.
Clean jokes.

1698
01:32:47.451 --> 01:32:49.820
When jokes about my daughter,
my daughter's in a room,

1699
01:32:50.060 --> 01:32:55.060
my youngest was fingering her ass and putting it in the dog's mouth and so and

1700
01:32:55.101 --> 01:32:55.930
so

1701
01:32:55.930 --> 01:32:59.650
<v 3>figured they're assholes all the time.
She's like,</v>

1702
01:32:59.710 --> 01:33:03.370
she'll be talking to me about like playing on the swings and she's just digging

1703
01:33:03.371 --> 01:33:07.780
in her vagina.
Oh,
fingers in her vagina.
So maybe we can go into swing.

1704
01:33:07.781 --> 01:33:09.070
What do you think?
Maybe we can do that.

1705
01:33:09.170 --> 01:33:11.980
Like maybe you can stop thinking yourself when you talking to your dad.

1706
01:33:12.170 --> 01:33:17.030
<v 2>No,
wait.
But that joke,
when you do you,</v>

1707
01:33:17.060 --> 01:33:19.230
when you do something about your children fingering their ass,

1708
01:33:20.340 --> 01:33:25.070
takes all the parents that went to see a clean show and put everyone at the same

1709
01:33:25.071 --> 01:33:26.720
level.
I said,
it does happen.
It does.

1710
01:33:26.721 --> 01:33:30.020
So then once their brains get reset for that,
then they go,
okay,

1711
01:33:30.140 --> 01:33:34.010
all this shit does happen.
And he's not being mean.
I stopped doing racial jokes,

1712
01:33:34.011 --> 01:33:37.800
like being heavy on racial jokes just cause I was like,
I don't fucking know.

1713
01:33:38.300 --> 01:33:39.080
I don't care.

1714
01:33:39.080 --> 01:33:44.080
Like I don't give a shit enough about equality to put my job on the line to try

1715
01:33:44.361 --> 01:33:47.660
to make everyone even like I'll,
I'll get into nights if it's an all black room.

1716
01:33:47.661 --> 01:33:52.130
I just do black jokes but not mean,
but just what I do black jokes.
But um,

1717
01:33:52.520 --> 01:33:53.151
and then you do that.

1718
01:33:53.151 --> 01:33:56.540
Once you do that you have a fucking power of attorney to do anything.

1719
01:33:56.690 --> 01:34:01.100
Cause even the clean people go my kid's finger the rest to right rail and then,

1720
01:34:01.130 --> 01:34:03.980
and then,
and then [inaudible] I've talked to the audience,

1721
01:34:04.080 --> 01:34:07.750
<v 3>well when you were saying that you um,
you used to do a re,
uh,</v>

1722
01:34:08.190 --> 01:34:11.100
racist jokes or racial jokes,
racial jokes,
you know,

1723
01:34:11.130 --> 01:34:14.040
w you and you stopped doing them because they offended too many people.

1724
01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:16.260
<v 2>I never gotten,
no one ever got offended,</v>

1725
01:34:16.261 --> 01:34:19.860
but I just noticed that I was up for one.
I was obsessing on it.
I can,

1726
01:34:19.940 --> 01:34:23.790
I would write,
I could write all day long.
I can write jokes about black people.

1727
01:34:25.020 --> 01:34:27.030
I mean if you've sent me,
I swear to God,

1728
01:34:27.150 --> 01:34:28.950
if you put me in a room with a black audience,

1729
01:34:29.220 --> 01:34:33.900
all I'll do is talk about black people all I'll do.
And like now the dirty,

1730
01:34:33.910 --> 01:34:38.520
the one,
only the furthest I go is I have a joke about,
um,
just uh,
I go,

1731
01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:41.040
I think is racist that they don't make black baby powder.

1732
01:34:41.650 --> 01:34:44.160
Like I just think that from a company named Johnson and Johnson,

1733
01:34:44.161 --> 01:34:47.500
they would have thought of that by now.
And then they go,
you know that,
uh,

1734
01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:51.090
that's home and make $1 million.
I'm going to buy baby powder.
And then,
uh,

1735
01:34:51.380 --> 01:34:54.480
and then,
and then I'll call it magic Johnson and Johnson's.

1736
01:34:54.510 --> 01:34:56.640
So then one night there's one,
this is great.

1737
01:34:56.641 --> 01:35:01.130
One night black dude's since I'm in an audience in Miami,
goes,
hey motherfucker,

1738
01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:03.740
when you get done,
you put the joke about black baby powder.

1739
01:35:03.741 --> 01:35:07.000
I'll tell you why don't make shit.
And so I was like,
I'm thinking,

1740
01:35:07.001 --> 01:35:10.940
I'm done with a joke now.
Like,
what's,
why don't they make it?
And he goes,

1741
01:35:11.240 --> 01:35:15.070
we don't have a problem with moisture the way you guys do.
He goes,

1742
01:35:15.530 --> 01:35:19.240
every time I hung a white guys like hugging a dolphin,
he goes black,

1743
01:35:19.241 --> 01:35:21.110
you have a problem retaining moisture.

1744
01:35:22.250 --> 01:35:26.360
So they have a problem getting ashy.
So they have to always stay moist,

1745
01:35:26.361 --> 01:35:30.380
whereas white people are constantly fucking moist.
Wow.
And so he's like,

1746
01:35:30.381 --> 01:35:34.520
they just never needed black baby powder black people.
And I was like,

1747
01:35:34.521 --> 01:35:38.690
but it was awesome.
It was like a great moment.
I love,
dude,
if I could,

1748
01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:42.380
if I had a videotape of every experience that I will buy them,
one of audience,

1749
01:35:42.650 --> 01:35:46.080
I would be aid the most famous comic in the world.
The,

1750
01:35:46.110 --> 01:35:49.790
I've had black dudes get on stage in Miami,
right?
Real Shit.

1751
01:35:50.180 --> 01:35:55.070
Fucking three gangsters in the front row.
True Story.
All my children fucking,

1752
01:35:55.071 --> 01:35:57.440
they're ruining the show for everyone.
And I go up and I just talked to them.

1753
01:35:57.770 --> 01:36:01.140
One do gets up on stage,
half of day,
my set,
and he's like,
there's,

1754
01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:04.850
there's a real mother fucker.
He's keeping it real,
real talk right now.
Real talk,

1755
01:36:04.910 --> 01:36:05.190
you know,

1756
01:36:05.190 --> 01:36:07.930
real motherfuckers getting the three Oh five and he drops his pants and shows

1757
01:36:07.931 --> 01:36:10.610
his Dick Place goes bananas.
Right.
They're like,
whoa.

1758
01:36:10.611 --> 01:36:14.670
And it's a the biggest blackest.
It's almost purple.
It's so black like,

1759
01:36:14.780 --> 01:36:18.650
but as Jack,
huge,
it's huge.
And I'm like,
that isn't real.

1760
01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:23.600
That is bugging real.
And then I'm bugging months,
nine inches.
And it's a,
it's a,

1761
01:36:23.601 --> 01:36:27.710
it's a shower.
It's like a thick,
thick,
thick,

1762
01:36:27.740 --> 01:36:32.570
an uncircumcised.
I'm just looking at it like,
Holy Shit.
So then I go,
I go,
man,

1763
01:36:32.630 --> 01:36:36.020
that's fucking,
his name was ray.
I don't know why I remember that.
But I'm like,

1764
01:36:36.021 --> 01:36:36.890
Ray,
I go,

1765
01:36:36.891 --> 01:36:40.580
I think you might want to get off stage because I can guarantee you you're,

1766
01:36:40.630 --> 01:36:43.430
they're calling the cops right now and I don't want you to go to jail for just

1767
01:36:43.431 --> 01:36:46.370
showing your deck.
He's like,
I appreciate that.
Good looking out.

1768
01:36:46.371 --> 01:36:50.270
And then he puts his pants on and leave.
So then I go,
man,
how do you follow that?

1769
01:36:50.390 --> 01:36:53.030
Another gang banger stands up,
gets onstage.
I go,
please tell me.

1770
01:36:53.031 --> 01:36:56.150
We're seeing another cock right now.
Pulls his pants down,

1771
01:36:56.180 --> 01:37:00.140
bugging just as big but lighter,
lighter,
like a lighter brown.
And I'm like,

1772
01:37:00.141 --> 01:37:03.580
Holy Shit.
I'm like,
and I was like,
you might want to go catch up with the breaks.

1773
01:37:03.581 --> 01:37:06.170
I can't guarantee you they're calling the cops now.
So they're sitting with,

1774
01:37:06.171 --> 01:37:09.920
I swear to all my children,
they're sitting with an heroin,
a hairless albino.

1775
01:37:10.070 --> 01:37:11.390
Okay.
And I said,

1776
01:37:11.570 --> 01:37:14.780
and now and now that the crowd is like fucking in a fevered pitch.
I go,

1777
01:37:14.840 --> 01:37:18.950
that's funny.
Out of all the Dicks,
I wanted to see what was yours.
He stands up,

1778
01:37:19.150 --> 01:37:22.670
get on stage,
takes his dick out and it looks like a light house.

1779
01:37:22.770 --> 01:37:25.190
There's no grass,
right white.

1780
01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:29.990
And they're flipping over fucking tables now.
Like fucking going nuts.

1781
01:37:30.140 --> 01:37:31.730
And I was like,
Ladies and gentlemen,
that's my show.

1782
01:37:38.440 --> 01:37:42.080
I literally followed that.
You can't follow that,
can't follow it.
I literally,

1783
01:37:42.140 --> 01:37:45.170
and I've white glow in the dark Casper that goes dick all was,

1784
01:37:45.350 --> 01:37:49.460
it was beautiful and it was good.
It was big.
I swear he was big.
And I was like,

1785
01:37:50.150 --> 01:37:51.770
oh,
I was like fucking.
And then,

1786
01:37:51.860 --> 01:37:54.560
and then they all waited for me out at the bar and they were like,
dude,

1787
01:37:54.561 --> 01:37:58.260
we're taking you out.
And I was like,
I don't know,
this doesn't end this way.

1788
01:37:59.250 --> 01:38:02.310
But I was hitting my like,
I want to be David's hell phase hardcore.

1789
01:38:02.460 --> 01:38:04.320
And I was like,
I'm fucking going out with these guys.

1790
01:38:04.470 --> 01:38:06.480
This is what comedy is about is having this experience.

1791
01:38:06.690 --> 01:38:10.080
I went in one time to do radio.
Miami's my crazy club.

1792
01:38:10.081 --> 01:38:14.670
Like I go in and I do the fucking morning pimp shell and they happen to have,

1793
01:38:14.690 --> 01:38:18.290
if you do the Improv in Miami all the time,
I stopped going to that place,
man,

1794
01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:22.110
you can't.
You can't because you're not,
you're famous.

1795
01:38:22.111 --> 01:38:26.010
So when they,
how's that gone away?
Before I was famous.

1796
01:38:26.011 --> 01:38:28.140
But that club wants to get the best of you.

1797
01:38:28.590 --> 01:38:30.660
Like they want to show you you're wrong.

1798
01:38:31.230 --> 01:38:34.940
Now what happened with me was I was on stage once then that brought up a boxer,

1799
01:38:34.950 --> 01:38:36.250
I forget the boxer's name was,

1800
01:38:36.330 --> 01:38:39.360
I think it was Oscar de la Hoya in one of my jokes.
And you,
oh,

1801
01:38:39.361 --> 01:38:44.290
you referenced him broke out in the audience over,
you know,
you know,
fuck.
Yup,

1802
01:38:44.420 --> 01:38:45.870
finish gender,
kick his ass.

1803
01:38:46.020 --> 01:38:49.230
And then dudes were standing up and yelling at each other and like an argument

1804
01:38:49.231 --> 01:38:52.770
broke out in the crowd over like what boxer was the best boxer?

1805
01:38:53.070 --> 01:38:55.080
Who would fuck you up?
And I didn't.
I just stopped and I said,

1806
01:38:55.081 --> 01:38:57.600
I'm never coming back here.
Yeah,
that's just a bad audience.

1807
01:38:57.601 --> 01:39:00.870
And that could have happened.
No,
no,
no.
That's very common there.
Miami Improv Day,

1808
01:39:01.050 --> 01:39:03.210
they lost control of that place a long time ago.

1809
01:39:04.860 --> 01:39:06.480
They stopped too many free tickets.

1810
01:39:06.481 --> 01:39:08.820
They give away a ton of free tickets if you're white because they can sell

1811
01:39:08.821 --> 01:39:10.800
tickets to black people.
And then,

1812
01:39:10.820 --> 01:39:13.680
but so one time I go to the morning pimp shell and they have this gang in there

1813
01:39:13.770 --> 01:39:16.890
called the XO pound,
right?
A real gang.
Real gang dude.

1814
01:39:16.891 --> 01:39:19.920
Look it up there on gang land.
Okay.
These are all Haitian motherfuckers.

1815
01:39:20.170 --> 01:39:23.640
So they're doing this thing,
the song Amaa zone.

1816
01:39:23.670 --> 01:39:26.910
That's the song that they're singing in studio.
Now mind you,

1817
01:39:26.911 --> 01:39:29.790
I'm just doing radio.
I'm doing press like I'm just there to fuck around.

1818
01:39:29.880 --> 01:39:31.830
But I know the one thing I do in these stations,

1819
01:39:31.831 --> 01:39:35.040
I bring a bottle of Tequila in and then I get everyone drunk and then I just

1820
01:39:35.041 --> 01:39:37.200
take my shirt off and we'd go fucking great.
And you do press,

1821
01:39:37.201 --> 01:39:41.700
you always bring into kilos sometimes.
Sometimes I've done it before,

1822
01:39:41.701 --> 01:39:45.150
but I think that's more because I'm an alcoholic and not like,
not for,

1823
01:39:45.260 --> 01:39:50.130
but like sometimes drunk with you in the morning and you'll sell out the entire

1824
01:39:50.131 --> 01:39:53.100
fucking weekend cause all anyone's doing is driving to work.

1825
01:39:53.101 --> 01:39:56.610
Wishing they were drinking and then they hear you drinking and all the rules go

1826
01:39:56.611 --> 01:40:01.150
out the door and every show that you stay on until fucking 11 like you,

1827
01:40:01.170 --> 01:40:05.220
it's the eye.
It's been like a little trick I've done.
Wow.

1828
01:40:05.221 --> 01:40:09.450
But what do you feel like take a nap.
Take it home.

1829
01:40:10.380 --> 01:40:13.900
Take him down.
I was looking,
I look at you when you,
when,

1830
01:40:13.901 --> 01:40:17.370
when you go into a radio,
I seen your radios and you'll come in.
Hi.
Hi.
It's fun.

1831
01:40:17.371 --> 01:40:19.770
I'm like,
how do you function for the rest of the day?
Oh I do,

1832
01:40:19.771 --> 01:40:22.050
but high doesn't kick your ass a basketball.

1833
01:40:22.051 --> 01:40:24.600
I smoke weed and then I go to the gym.
Like it doesn't,

1834
01:40:24.630 --> 01:40:26.820
it doesn't affect name the same way I go.

1835
01:40:26.940 --> 01:40:29.460
Like if I'll do like in the morning radio and I'll,
I'll,

1836
01:40:29.550 --> 01:40:31.580
I'll smoke some weed for the morning radio.
They're like,

1837
01:40:31.590 --> 01:40:32.730
I'll go to the gym afterwards.

1838
01:40:32.731 --> 01:40:36.090
I go lift weights or run or I'll do the elliptical machine.
Like it feels good.

1839
01:40:36.210 --> 01:40:39.690
I usually,
yeah,
I don't do that.
Drank man.
When I drink,
I'm done.

1840
01:40:39.720 --> 01:40:44.700
Then I'm damn done.
Um,
I have a very long history of drinking,
so,
but,

1841
01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:48.240
oh,
zero pound.
So these guys are saying it.
So we,

1842
01:40:48.241 --> 01:40:51.420
and I'm doing shots kill on there and they're calling me cocaine because I'm

1843
01:40:51.421 --> 01:40:54.760
white.
And so then,
uh,
so then I tell them,
I go,

1844
01:40:54.761 --> 01:40:57.160
you guys can go onto my show tonight if you want.
And they're like,
oh,

1845
01:40:57.161 --> 01:40:59.350
we'll come and we'll come and we'll come around it.
You're crazy.
I'm like,

1846
01:40:59.470 --> 01:41:02.080
I'm like,
this will be fun because I just seen these guys on gang land,
right?

1847
01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:07.240
So they'd come to the show and like 15 minutes in and they walk on stage like

1848
01:41:07.300 --> 01:41:10.450
Matt just deep with the fucking bottle of Tequila and they're like,

1849
01:41:10.750 --> 01:41:13.870
we're drinking this onstage right now.
And I'm like,
Holy Shit.

1850
01:41:13.871 --> 01:41:18.871
And Dj last comes up and we all just fucking Dj Dj that we're supposed to know

1851
01:41:19.331 --> 01:41:23.430
what the fuck that guy is the biggest DJ in south Florida for Latino's.
Yeah,

1852
01:41:23.980 --> 01:41:25.750
but like,
and he'll have like if you,

1853
01:41:26.020 --> 01:41:28.150
if you're a white comic and you can get in that room and do well,

1854
01:41:28.151 --> 01:41:30.310
you'll sell out for the weekend.
Like you're not sell out,

1855
01:41:30.311 --> 01:41:33.190
but you'll doubt not sell out.
You know,
I'm buying in west palm this weekend.

1856
01:41:33.250 --> 01:41:38.080
Not this weekend.
Next weekend is you doing porn porn Rossi.

Yeah,

Hell fucking,
yeah.

1858
01:41:40.541 --> 01:41:43.270
I've done their show many,
many times.
Those guys were really cool.
That's a,

1859
01:41:43.271 --> 01:41:46.270
that's a great club.
And you probably know Johnny,
that Guy's management now.
Yeah,

1860
01:41:46.271 --> 01:41:49.510
I've been to that club a long time ago.
Back when it was a smaller club dude,

1861
01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:52.510
that's your market.
Those guys fucking like those people.

1862
01:41:52.690 --> 01:41:54.800
Like when you get done a show,
you know who the big comics aren't,

1863
01:41:54.820 --> 01:41:57.310
you know the ones that people don't go see our goodbye.

1864
01:41:57.311 --> 01:42:01.540
Who based on what comics go.
So do you know guys?
Like everyone was says,

1865
01:42:01.541 --> 01:42:05.350
do you know Rogan?
Everyone always wants to know if you know Dane Cook.
Um,

1866
01:42:05.830 --> 01:42:08.850
who do you know who like to hang out with in Hollywood?
Basically the,

1867
01:42:08.860 --> 01:42:11.770
and I'm always like,
hey,
they're all great,

But uh,

1868
01:42:11.860 --> 01:42:15.730
did you ever talk shit about anybody?
Oh yeah.
What comics she talks shit about.

1869
01:42:15.790 --> 01:42:20.440
I can't,
I can't sit and say,
I can't say,
but I mean you could probably guess,

1870
01:42:20.470 --> 01:42:22.800
but yeah,
I talk,
I talk shit about it.

1871
01:42:22.900 --> 01:42:25.090
I got a standard we got to stop cause there's comics.

1872
01:42:25.091 --> 01:42:28.480
I've talked shit about a lot,

They just came up to me and they're like,

1873

Stonewashed feeling in the world.
Like,
you know,

1875
01:42:35.020 --> 01:42:40.020
Ari is someone who I initially did not like cause I met him one night and he was

1876
01:42:40.041 --> 01:42:43.240
just standoffish but he was just sorry he was,
he wouldn't even stand offish.

1877
01:42:43.390 --> 01:42:43.620
Yeah.

1878
01:42:43.620 --> 01:42:46.990
And I wanted to meet him and then he did it and then he walked away and then I

1879
01:42:46.991 --> 01:42:48.700
was like,
I was like,
Oh fuck that guy.

1880
01:42:48.700 --> 01:42:53.700
And then I saw and then I saw his amazing racist and I was like,

1881
01:42:53.950 --> 01:42:57.990
I saw a clip and I was wanting to hate it.
I wanted to hate it cause yeah.

1882
01:42:58.990 --> 01:43:01.000
Yeah.
Then I watched it.
It was the best thing.

1883
01:43:01.001 --> 01:43:02.980
I said I don't give a fuck when I see that guy again,

1884
01:43:02.981 --> 01:43:05.920
I'm going to make friends with them.
And I saw him at the Improv one night,

1885
01:43:05.921 --> 01:43:09.640
like right after the shit went down with you and Mitzia like you guys switched

1886
01:43:09.910 --> 01:43:11.950
and I was like,
dude,
I just want to tell you like I'm a big fan.

1887
01:43:12.160 --> 01:43:16.180
Like you make me laugh a lot.
And then an orange just like,
really thanks man.

1888
01:43:16.870 --> 01:43:19.720
We hung out and then,
yeah,
but if you tell people you like them,

1889
01:43:19.870 --> 01:43:23.650
then they like you to a lot of tools you have to fucking do a lot of times.
Yeah,

1890
01:43:23.651 --> 01:43:26.500
a lot of times comics or standoffish with each other because everyone is so

1891
01:43:26.501 --> 01:43:30.940
competitive and especially early on comics for some reason have this weird thing

1892
01:43:30.941 --> 01:43:33.880
where they think that if someone else is being successful that somehow or

1893
01:43:33.881 --> 01:43:38.380
another it keeps them from being successful.
Their success takes away from you.

1894
01:43:38.381 --> 01:43:40.720
Like that could have been yours or something crazy.

1895
01:43:40.721 --> 01:43:44.480
It's like this weird illogical connection that a lot of comics make an a tap.

1896
01:43:44.530 --> 01:43:47.430
It almost happens with every fucking comic you meet.
Yeah.
Why is that?

1897
01:43:47.560 --> 01:43:48.161
I don't know.

1898
01:43:48.161 --> 01:43:51.650
I think I know for cause I'll have arguments with comics in my heads.

1899
01:43:51.890 --> 01:43:55.730
I've had argued and fake a fake argument argument with ob from opiate.

1900
01:43:55.731 --> 01:43:57.590
Anthony and I had never met the guy in my entire life,

1901
01:43:58.420 --> 01:44:02.030
but I love their show and I wanted to get on their show to promote things.

1902
01:44:02.060 --> 01:44:04.460
Oh did,
you'd be awesome.
When they're showing they perfect for their show.

1903
01:44:04.490 --> 01:44:06.980
They never let me on.
Like they're always like,
no,
no,

1904
01:44:07.010 --> 01:44:08.870
they still don't want y'all still and let me on and listen,

1905
01:44:08.871 --> 01:44:10.730
opie listens to this show sometimes.

1906
01:44:10.850 --> 01:44:13.970
I guarantee you he'll hear about this from Twitter and he'll have you on.

1907
01:44:13.971 --> 01:44:17.000
I had a dream on,
cut up some clips of the funniest shit that he said,

1908
01:44:17.001 --> 01:44:18.620
and it will be on opiates.
So here's what happened.

1909
01:44:18.621 --> 01:44:22.400
I had a dream last night that I could fly and I flew into opiod Auntie's studio

1910
01:44:22.580 --> 01:44:25.280
and I was walking around.
I was like,
Oh shit.
Fly through the air.
Yeah,

1911
01:44:25.281 --> 01:44:27.140
but there's two out of a plane without planet was flying.

1912
01:44:27.190 --> 01:44:29.770
I was flying and it was in a tent.
It was an intent.

1913
01:44:30.130 --> 01:44:33.260
And I went in and they had these gift bags and I was like,
oh.

1914
01:44:33.350 --> 01:44:35.790
So I opened one up and I was stealing when I was like,
oh,

1915
01:44:35.791 --> 01:44:38.000
I want to get one of these.
I love Opie and Anthony is we awesome?

1916
01:44:38.180 --> 01:44:41.510
And that was an opiate Anthony scarf.
So I pulled it out and I went,
oh fuck.

1917
01:44:41.690 --> 01:44:44.150
I can't use an opiate.
Anthony scarf cause then ever will,
no,

1918
01:44:44.300 --> 01:44:46.460
I got it from here and then there'll be like,
we didn't give it to you.

1919
01:44:46.520 --> 01:44:49.480
So I put it back and then I left.
I flew away and then I was,

1920
01:44:49.490 --> 01:44:51.800
as I was hovering above their tent where they were doing their show,

1921
01:44:51.980 --> 01:44:54.980
ob came in and said,
who stole this fucking scarp who's,
and I was like,

1922
01:44:54.981 --> 01:44:57.830
you know what,
if I man up to this and tell them,
Norton will have my back.

1923
01:44:57.950 --> 01:45:02.240
So I go in and I go in and I'm like,
listen,
I am the one who opened that.

1924
01:45:02.241 --> 01:45:05.060
I didn't steal it,
but Norton was in there and it would be like,

1925
01:45:05.061 --> 01:45:07.580
who the fuck are you?
You're and he basically,
in my dream,

1926
01:45:07.640 --> 01:45:10.880
my brain told me everything about me that I think like all the horrible shit.

1927
01:45:11.030 --> 01:45:13.580
So now I'm pissed off at Opi for fucking saying that to me.

1928
01:45:13.640 --> 01:45:16.010
So I start getting in a fight with him and then I wake up,
right.

1929
01:45:16.160 --> 01:45:19.310
And then I literally laid in bed arguing with ob,
never met him.

1930
01:45:19.311 --> 01:45:22.610
I listened to his show every day.
I'm the biggest fucking fan.
So you would like,

1931
01:45:22.670 --> 01:45:27.530
you were like preparing yourself and Katie in case I go in and he literally does

1932
01:45:27.531 --> 01:45:31.790
the,
you know,
typical ob throw a chess set at me,
like fucks with me,
ruins me,

1933
01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:35.180
like tries to make me look like a fool.
He doesn't really do that to comic style.

1934
01:45:35.400 --> 01:45:38.480
I don't really does that.
And he did a,
he used to,
I think they used to a lot.

1935
01:45:38.510 --> 01:45:41.400
Really?
We,
they did it to the guy that killed himself.
Who?

1936
01:45:41.720 --> 01:45:46.300
One of the guy in the bathtub that,
oh,
Richard.
Jenny.
They really did it.
Richard.

1937
01:45:46.340 --> 01:45:48.590
Jenny.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1938
01:45:48.591 --> 01:45:52.490
They made him like stand outside the studio and they wouldn't let him in what co

1939
01:45:52.670 --> 01:45:56.420
all radio show guys would sell out their mom for a bit.
Wow.

1940
01:45:56.450 --> 01:45:59.090
Like if they think they can get a good bid out of humiliating me.

1941
01:45:59.091 --> 01:46:01.550
What happened with the Richard Jeni thing?
What,
what,
what was the story?

1942
01:46:01.610 --> 01:46:04.640
I'm literally,
I've probably listened to every opening,
Anthony,

1943
01:46:04.750 --> 01:46:08.140
it's just back in the day they made him sit outside,
um,

1944
01:46:08.930 --> 01:46:13.130
sit outside of the studio in the glass and they would,

1945
01:46:13.131 --> 01:46:16.240
they made him do his interview from there.
What?
Like,
I think,

1946
01:46:16.290 --> 01:46:19.010
I think he was in on it though.
Maybe that went oh,
no,
no,
no,
no.

1947
01:46:19.011 --> 01:46:21.960
I don't think they liked him.
Why?
I don't know.
I don't remember this,

1948
01:46:21.970 --> 01:46:25.370
the whole story.
I'm probably paraphrasing in a way that makes it horrible.

1949
01:46:25.490 --> 01:46:28.970
But yeah,
it was a guy that had a weird reputation.
Now Jenny was,

1950
01:46:29.070 --> 01:46:32.000
it was a troubled guy,
brilliant comedian though,
man.

1951
01:46:32.001 --> 01:46:35.960
I went to see him when I was an open miker at catch a rising star in New York

1952
01:46:36.140 --> 01:46:40.040
and he really influenced me a lot early in my career to the point where I caught

1953
01:46:40.041 --> 01:46:42.470
myself a couple of times on stage when I was really young,

1954
01:46:42.740 --> 01:46:45.320
when I was sounding just like him,
where I was like,
Ooh,

1955
01:46:45.321 --> 01:46:48.080
I got to fucking make sure I don't,
I mean,
I'm selling,
I'm ripping him off.

1956
01:46:48.081 --> 01:46:49.920
Like I'm like,
I'm imitating him,
you know?

1957
01:46:50.010 --> 01:46:53.310
<v 1>I think so many comics do that.
Oh well he was so good man.
What anyway,</v>

1958
01:46:53.320 --> 01:46:54.750
I saw when I saw him at catch a rising star,

1959
01:46:54.870 --> 01:46:58.770
he influenced me so much cause he just free bald.
He had so much material.

1960
01:46:58.920 --> 01:47:02.160
He just went all over the place that I'd never seen anybody do that before.

1961
01:47:02.310 --> 01:47:06.090
Everybody else that I had seen do sets,
they always had like a sort of a,

1962
01:47:06.091 --> 01:47:06.871
an opening.

1963
01:47:06.871 --> 01:47:10.350
The dude always do and then have a middle part and then they would have a
closer.

1964
01:47:10.550 --> 01:47:11.670
When I saw Richard Jeni,
man,

1965
01:47:11.671 --> 01:47:14.970
I saw him a couple times in a row and every time I saw him he was doing like a

1966
01:47:14.971 --> 01:47:19.680
different hour and a half.
And I was,
I was like super humbled.
He was so quick.

1967
01:47:19.790 --> 01:47:19.950
The,

1968
01:47:19.950 --> 01:47:23.970
I remember hosting form of Hollywood improv and I'm in the back watching him and

1969
01:47:24.020 --> 01:47:26.820
you know,
I'd come from New York.
So I was like,
in my head I was like,

1970
01:47:26.821 --> 01:47:28.890
if I didn't know you in New York,
you're not anything.

1971
01:47:29.190 --> 01:47:32.390
Basically it was basically saying,
if you're not Geraldo,
hell uh,

1972
01:47:32.550 --> 01:47:34.290
Hedberg in my head.
Right.

1973
01:47:34.990 --> 01:47:37.710
So someone says,

1974
01:47:37.711 --> 01:47:39.780
he said something and now we're going to go over there and look for,

1975
01:47:39.781 --> 01:47:42.720
this is right after nine 11 now they want to tell us to go over there and look

1976
01:47:42.721 --> 01:47:44.280
for weapons of mass destruction.

1977
01:47:44.430 --> 01:47:47.580
What a load of bullshit is that you think they got them in?
Some lady goes,

1978
01:47:47.730 --> 01:47:50.460
they have nuclear weapons and he goes,
listen,
you dumb whore.

1979
01:47:50.610 --> 01:47:53.220
If they had them they would have fucking use them.

1980
01:47:53.340 --> 01:47:56.600
Do you think they're holding back and I was just on the floor.
I was like,

1981
01:47:56.601 --> 01:48:00.480
what a great perception.
Like would they hope?
Would they use them?

1982
01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.900
Then of course it would have used them be a,
he was,
he was great.

1983
01:48:04.260 --> 01:48:08.970
He was so prolific and he was the best guy than I had ever seen at really like

1984
01:48:08.971 --> 01:48:11.400
dragging the most out of a subject.

1985
01:48:11.580 --> 01:48:15.510
Like he would get on a subject and he would fuck that subject up from all

1986
01:48:15.511 --> 01:48:17.550
different angles and right when you thought he was done,

1987
01:48:17.551 --> 01:48:19.850
he would go deeper and then he would go deeper and a you would.

1988
01:48:19.920 --> 01:48:21.540
It made me realize like,
man,

1989
01:48:21.541 --> 01:48:25.410
that's something that's really a present in amateurish comics where they will

1990
01:48:25.411 --> 01:48:28.260
touch on a subject and then immediately have a quick joke and then immediately

1991
01:48:28.261 --> 01:48:31.860
go to another subject.
To me,
well it's,
everybody in the beginning is me.

1992
01:48:31.890 --> 01:48:35.960
I've gotten so fucking lazy.
It's a bad thing,
man.
You know,
it's,
it's,
you know,

1993
01:48:36.170 --> 01:48:38.230
it's,
it's really easy to do,
you know,

1994
01:48:38.350 --> 01:48:39.810
especially when you get comfortable on stage,

1995
01:48:39.811 --> 01:48:42.870
especially if you do a lot of ad libbing.
And yet when you get a good ad Lib,

1996
01:48:42.871 --> 01:48:43.191
you're like,
well,

1997
01:48:43.191 --> 01:48:46.560
it was genius and keep that as opposed to looking for the better one.
But Jenny,

1998
01:48:46.590 --> 01:48:48.900
Jenny would take like any subject,
whatever it was,

1999
01:48:48.901 --> 01:48:51.870
and just find all sorts of angles with it.
He never really got the credit,

2000
01:48:51.871 --> 01:48:54.270
I think he deserved.
It was really weird,
you know?

2001
01:48:54.370 --> 01:48:56.970
I just think people didn't appreciate how good he was.
No.

2002
01:48:56.971 --> 01:48:59.910
What was your from the east side Comedy Club in New York and Long Island.

2003
01:48:59.911 --> 01:49:03.510
I saw him there too.
And uh,
I remember Peter Bailes,
who was the host,

2004
01:49:03.690 --> 01:49:07.020
was just shaking his head back and forth.
He's like,
he did three different hours.

2005
01:49:07.200 --> 01:49:09.840
He did three different shows and three totally different hours because he didn't

2006
01:49:09.841 --> 01:49:11.220
read it.
Repeat one joke once.

2007
01:49:11.490 --> 01:49:16.020
I was influenced by a tell a massively like in New York I'll drinking too that

2008
01:49:16.021 --> 01:49:19.470
that oh no,
I was editing thing.
Oh I was fine.
I told you I came in,

2009
01:49:19.770 --> 01:49:23.160
explained that because this is a crazy story.
You didn't say this on the podcast.

2010
01:49:23.490 --> 01:49:25.260
I have.
I went,
I was in 1997.

2011
01:49:25.261 --> 01:49:30.090
Rollingstone magazine wrote a six page article about me calling me the number

2012
01:49:30.091 --> 01:49:31.350
one party animal in the country.

2013
01:49:31.530 --> 01:49:34.220
It's actually gets a little weirder when you doing stand up back then and just

2014
01:49:34.230 --> 01:49:35.850
partying.
Just,
I had a room,

2015
01:49:35.870 --> 01:49:40.260
notorious reputation of Florida state for being like funny but being a wild

2016
01:49:40.261 --> 01:49:43.730
party animal.
Like what kind of Shit where you doing?
Just Fun Shit like uh,

2017
01:49:44.030 --> 01:49:47.980
like fun.
I think Wa loudest guy in the room.
Shit.
You know like I remember I

2018
01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:50.950
<v 2>used to climb up on his telephone pole outside the bars on Tennessee street.</v>

2019
01:49:51.100 --> 01:49:53.920
There'll be 500 people out there and I just stand up my go.

2020
01:49:54.130 --> 01:49:58.420
Everyone shut the fuck up and listen,
if you want a smoke weed,

2021
01:49:58.600 --> 01:50:02.980
go to my house and the cops are all sitting there.
I have tons of weed,

2022
01:50:02.981 --> 01:50:06.820
enough for everybody and we're all gonna have a blast and get eye.

2023
01:50:06.910 --> 01:50:09.700
If you know where I live,
you're invited.
If you don't ask someone,

2024
01:50:09.820 --> 01:50:13.090
just no one tell the fucking gobs and you'd have literally 500 people just

2025
01:50:13.091 --> 01:50:16.750
giggling at the idea that someone was offering them weed in front of the cops

2026
01:50:16.751 --> 01:50:20.410
face.
And what are the cops say when you did this?
They would laugh too.

2027
01:50:20.740 --> 01:50:22.810
Like one time for an election,
uh,

2028
01:50:22.811 --> 01:50:26.860
gotten naked for this election and just shit on a pizza box and won the election

2029
01:50:27.820 --> 01:50:29.530
election.
For what?
For my fraternity.

2030
01:50:29.531 --> 01:50:33.790
I just got up naked and shit on a pizza box and then everyone and then I won.

2031
01:50:33.940 --> 01:50:36.730
Did you wipe?
No,
just shit.
I just,
Shit.

2032
01:50:36.940 --> 01:50:39.340
I learned one very important lesson when you go number two,

2033
01:50:39.341 --> 01:50:43.000
you also go one because I pissed all over the feet on everyone that was sitting

2034
01:50:43.010 --> 01:50:45.640
here.
Stop it when you go one.

2035
01:50:47.590 --> 01:50:50.380
And so I won the election.
So I'm like all these stories came out.

2036
01:50:51.040 --> 01:50:55.360
And then rolling stones like let's do a fucking,
let's do an article on him.

2037
01:50:55.420 --> 01:50:57.280
Oh my God.
It gets crazier.
Ready?

2038
01:50:57.281 --> 01:51:00.610
Sorry for the you already for the part that you go that you go bullshit.

2039
01:51:00.700 --> 01:51:04.840
I will never say bull shit.
I've heard enough of your stories.
I'm not so,
so uh,

2040
01:51:05.080 --> 01:51:09.460
so Oliver stone option the rights to my life and then from the article.

2041
01:51:09.640 --> 01:51:12.840
So then I try stand up and I moved to New York to just start doing stamps.

2042
01:51:12.880 --> 01:51:16.780
I did it once and to in a townhouse,
you know we went amazing.

2043
01:51:17.230 --> 01:51:20.530
I can offer my own morning show in Tallahassee.
Really?
Yeah.
Oliver Stone Officer.

2044
01:51:20.531 --> 01:51:21.131
The rights of my life.

2045
01:51:21.131 --> 01:51:24.100
Like I start doing standup five months later will Smith sees me to stand up and

2046
01:51:24.101 --> 01:51:26.390
I got to deal development deal with him like right out the gate.

2047
01:51:26.391 --> 01:51:29.560
It's like bill burst style like been doing standup for no time at all.

2048
01:51:29.650 --> 01:51:33.040
Development deal based on the article and that the fact that I could competently

2049
01:51:33.041 --> 01:51:36.850
do stand up somewhat and then the development deal falls apart with Oliver
Stone.

2050
01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:40.750
All the guys that have submitted their scripts for Oliver Stone's movie about my

2051
01:51:40.751 --> 01:51:43.120
life,
then get their intellectual property back.

2052
01:51:43.300 --> 01:51:47.280
One of the guy takes his movie changes,
my name sells it,

2053
01:51:47.281 --> 01:51:51.760
the National Lampoon and it becomes a movie Van Wilder.
So theoretically,

2054
01:51:51.761 --> 01:51:54.760
and I say this theoretically loosely,
I'll never be able to sue.

2055
01:51:54.760 --> 01:51:58.330
I'm never would sue,
I never would sue.
But I went into national lampoon and did,

2056
01:51:58.480 --> 01:52:03.130
do you remember Kevin Couch?
He used to have a show on nationally XM radio.

2057
01:52:03.820 --> 01:52:05.680
And I told him,
I said,
bring some exact same,

2058
01:52:05.860 --> 01:52:07.630
I've always wanted to find out if this is true.

2059
01:52:07.990 --> 01:52:10.570
So then he brought some exact sent and I start telling the stories.
It's like,

2060
01:52:10.571 --> 01:52:14.740
I am you one of the guys fucking locks up.
Like hold on,
stop right now.

2061
01:52:14.860 --> 01:52:17.650
What do you want?
What's going on here is just like an ambush.
And I was like,
no,

2062
01:52:17.651 --> 01:52:20.800
I just want to be able to tell it on radio.
And no,
I'm not lying.

2063
01:52:20.920 --> 01:52:25.800
That's all I care about.
All I care about is the story being like true.
Right.
And,

2064
01:52:25.930 --> 01:52:30.520
and he was like,
what do you want?
Like your own radio show.
I'm like,
Ugh,
fine.

2065
01:52:30.790 --> 01:52:31.450
And then he's like,

2066
01:52:31.450 --> 01:52:33.970
we'll do a show putting with the original Dan while and are you happy?

2067
01:52:34.180 --> 01:52:35.013
And I was like,
yeah.

2068
01:52:35.080 --> 01:52:38.660
And so then he was like pretty much I was like so I can say true but yeah,

2069
01:52:39.230 --> 01:52:40.240
you were going to sue them.

2070
01:52:40.270 --> 01:52:42.090
They were worried I was going to sue them cause we could,

2071
01:52:42.100 --> 01:52:45.650
this mean you have a case,
why don't you just go fucking sue those cons.

2072
01:52:45.680 --> 01:52:46.370
Barry Katz

2073
01:52:46.370 --> 01:52:49.580
<v 1>said to me,
one,
they pamper,
you can be one of two guys.</v>

2074
01:52:49.700 --> 01:52:53.210
You can be the guy that's Susan doesn't work or you can be the guy that doesn't

2075
01:52:53.211 --> 01:52:57.950
sue and works,
which won an Aria.
And I was like,
I'm the one to tell me to do.

2076
01:52:57.951 --> 01:53:00.800
I would immediately do the exact opposite.
Very cats,

2077
01:53:00.980 --> 01:53:05.270
very catches the guy can't see you said drive a Ferrari.
Why owed everyone money?

2078
01:53:05.330 --> 01:53:08.330
He looked like the grimace when they'd sell a toy grimace.
And a car.

2079
01:53:08.480 --> 01:53:11.880
Just a big head sticking out of a tiny car.
He's so crazy.
He was,
uh,

2080
01:53:11.960 --> 01:53:14.870
he was like a big brother to me.
He was my manager for a long time.
What happened?

2081
01:53:14.871 --> 01:53:18.410
You got rid of them,
you wised up,
right?
Yeah.
And just do it was like,

2082
01:53:18.590 --> 01:53:22.340
he just wouldn't,
he's never could get in touch with them,
you know?

2083
01:53:23.300 --> 01:53:26.510
So I just went to 11 and comment.
I want to Rewatch van wilder,

2084
01:53:26.570 --> 01:53:30.020
but it's pretty good.
I've never seen while this is what you do,
Bro,

2085
01:53:30.021 --> 01:53:32.330
you find out what the fuck.
And Statute of limitations is,

2086
01:53:32.450 --> 01:53:36.530
get to a point where you're so talented.
You're so funny.
You cannot lose.

2087
01:53:36.650 --> 01:53:39.350
You just have to keep doing what you're doing.
You cannot lose your very,

2088
01:53:39.351 --> 01:53:42.500
very entertaining dude.
They can't stop you.

2089
01:53:42.501 --> 01:53:45.320
So once you get to a certain point and then you go after them,

2090
01:53:45.640 --> 01:53:47.040
cause a certain point where you're in,

2091
01:53:47.070 --> 01:53:49.690
embedded into the zeitgeists as you're just looking for a reason,

2092
01:53:49.691 --> 01:53:50.590
I use the words,
I can

2093
01:53:52.920 --> 01:53:56.240
show you my range or some man.
What is it?

2094
01:53:56.241 --> 01:53:59.750
It's a strange conspiracy movie that they've got three episodes.

2095
01:53:59.751 --> 01:54:03.950
And what's actually the cultural,
the idea of being on the mind of the culture.

2096
01:54:04.070 --> 01:54:08.210
Get into the consciousness of the culture.
The site case is like the mind frame.

2097
01:54:08.240 --> 01:54:10.550
Like how,
what were where people's heads are at right now?

2098
01:54:10.910 --> 01:54:14.900
The zeitgeists there was a new one that they just did recently.
I guess it's not,

2099
01:54:14.901 --> 01:54:18.950
but it's a lot of,
it's like nine 11 shit.
I tried to watch the first one,

2100
01:54:18.980 --> 01:54:21.770
correct shit about certain things about religion and I was like,

2101
01:54:22.850 --> 01:54:26.600
and then you get Zike guys debunked and things get really cloudy and people go

2102
01:54:26.601 --> 01:54:29.420
online and debunk it.
And who's right,
who's wrong?

2103
01:54:29.421 --> 01:54:31.470
I don't have time for this shit.
Yeah.
You know,

2104
01:54:32.390 --> 01:54:35.240
but you should sue the fuck out of those van white punks.
I'll never,

2105
01:54:35.330 --> 01:54:38.760
I'll never sue them,
but I pretend I'm,
you know,

2106
01:54:38.770 --> 01:54:41.930
so for you do it and then just give me your email address bro.

2107
01:54:42.410 --> 01:54:45.410
It's one of my pool anytime,
Bro.
Come on.
Bring your daughters.

2108
01:54:45.800 --> 01:54:47.870
My daughters in a hard little little park out here.

2109
01:54:47.900 --> 01:54:50.750
My daughters will think they swim in there like I can swim daddy.

2110
01:54:50.751 --> 01:54:53.810
And I love just that first second where they jumped in and in sync and then you

2111
01:54:53.811 --> 01:54:57.860
saved their lives and you see rescue in their eyes.
I can't swim Daddy.

2112
01:54:58.640 --> 01:55:02.240
Um,
I'm not into that.
I'm into showing them how to swim.

2113
01:55:04.450 --> 01:55:06.140
I'm trying to teach them how to

2114
01:55:09.020 --> 01:55:13.420
throw them in like my uncle Johnny,
like,
go for it.
This I learned,
boy,

2115
01:55:13.700 --> 01:55:16.040
I don't know how I learned how to swim.
That's how they did it to us.

2116
01:55:16.380 --> 01:55:19.370
They just do us in fucking pools.
I can't remember not knowing how to swim.

2117
01:55:19.371 --> 01:55:22.850
I just always knew how to swim.
I went to swimming lessons.
I'm must relate.

2118
01:55:22.851 --> 01:55:26.690
So I just got thrown in the pool by my uncle Johnny fucking uncle Johnny.

2119
01:55:27.170 --> 01:55:29.480
Same Dude whose son fell down a flight of stairs.
Really?

2120
01:55:29.510 --> 01:55:34.020
Same uncle and northeast baby.
That's how they did it.
Irish Catholic though.

2121
01:55:34.030 --> 01:55:36.230
You in a fucking pool that aren't had a swim.
Yeah.

2122
01:55:36.231 --> 01:55:41.000
I grew up native American style in Jersey and and in Boston.

2123
01:55:41.030 --> 01:55:44.070
My formative years that that northeast sort

2124
01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:48.030
<v 3>of a mentality.
There's a,
there's a,
there's a lot to that that makes,</v>

2125
01:55:48.031 --> 01:55:51.450
makes people like more go getter,
you know,
and it makes people more ambitious.

2126
01:55:51.690 --> 01:55:55.050
It makes people more the kind of people that can button down and get shit done.

2127
01:55:55.290 --> 01:55:57.150
You know,
there's something about California,

2128
01:55:57.151 --> 01:56:00.840
there's something about this weather where it's 85 degrees and in January,

2129
01:56:01.170 --> 01:56:05.150
so this makes you weak,
just makes you a soft little bitch.
You know,

2130
01:56:05.160 --> 01:56:06.720
I wrote this on my Twitter and I really believe this.

2131
01:56:06.721 --> 01:56:09.480
People need visible nature to keep them humble.

2132
01:56:09.690 --> 01:56:13.500
You need to see that snow storm common where you know you can't do shit.

2133
01:56:13.800 --> 01:56:15.150
Sit the fuck down.

2134
01:56:15.240 --> 01:56:18.690
I hope you have a logs to burn because you might need and the power might be out

2135
01:56:18.691 --> 01:56:22.110
for a week.
Yeah,
no one's going anywhere and that quiet.

2136
01:56:22.111 --> 01:56:26.910
You don't even know what quiet is until you get outside in the middle of a

2137
01:56:26.911 --> 01:56:30.540
blizzard when the blizzards over and everything's covered in snow,

2138
01:56:30.630 --> 01:56:34.680
like three feet of snow in Boston,
I would go outside and you could hear like,

2139
01:56:38.080 --> 01:56:41.810
I like the quiet has like a sound to it.
It's like it's empty.

2140
01:56:41.960 --> 01:56:43.190
It's like you don't hear anything.

2141
01:56:43.191 --> 01:56:46.820
The snow absorbs it all and it's almost like a fake world.

2142
01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.970
Like you go walking around and everything is white.
It's like,

2143
01:56:50.060 --> 01:56:53.480
I really feel sorry for kids that don't grow up with some snow.
Don't,

2144
01:56:53.481 --> 01:56:56.960
don't get to experience that.
And those fucking school days when you,

2145
01:56:57.080 --> 01:57:01.610
when you get a day off and he'd go outside and everything's covered in snow and

2146
01:57:01.630 --> 01:57:02.480
our grove was note all,

2147
01:57:02.481 --> 01:57:05.360
the only problem with that is you could die out there and fucking freeze to

2148
01:57:05.361 --> 01:57:07.490
death,
fall asleep in a snowdrift and lose your foot.

2149
01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:09.710
Did you hear about this lady in Toronto that happened last week?

2150
01:57:09.800 --> 01:57:10.880
The coldest night of the year.

2151
01:57:11.090 --> 01:57:14.240
She apparently she had dementia and she froze to death outside of the

2152
01:57:14.241 --> 01:57:18.710
neighborhood once she was screaming for people to help her.
Shit.
Yeah,

2153
01:57:18.770 --> 01:57:19.460
everyone's screaming.

2154
01:57:19.460 --> 01:57:22.490
She just died out there and she was apparently she was at just a known nut.

2155
01:57:22.730 --> 01:57:23.840
So like we are,
they're crazy.

2156
01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:28.040
<v 2>That's why it all in the snow.
Yeah.
The Bata dues fall asleep to lose losing for,</v>

2157
01:57:28.050 --> 01:57:32.400
I use a foot,
everyone loses it fucking foot.
Sidis still thrown down like

2158
01:57:32.590 --> 01:57:36.020
<v 3>core,
like he still partying at like you were or</v>

2159
01:57:36.450 --> 01:57:38.910
<v 2>down a little?
I don't know.
I don't know.</v>

2160
01:57:39.150 --> 01:57:41.820
I've had a major stretch where I didn't drink at all.

2161
01:57:42.330 --> 01:57:45.080
Did you feel different on stage when you're sober?
Oh,
I don't drink on stage.

2162
01:57:45.330 --> 01:57:46.140
Here's the thing.

2163
01:57:46.140 --> 01:57:48.500
Let me just rephrase that cause everyone that's listening has seen me on stage.

2164
01:57:48.510 --> 01:57:51.930
He's like,
hold on.
You fell off a stage one night.
The uh,

2165
01:57:51.960 --> 01:57:56.370
like I'm falling off stage twice.
The alien hammered,
uh,
Kinda not really.

2166
01:57:56.371 --> 01:57:57.330
Like I wasn't that drunk.

2167
01:57:57.331 --> 01:58:02.310
He just was bad footing like once in Tampa Improv and once in DC Improv.
But um,

2168
01:58:02.610 --> 01:58:04.380
but yeah,
here's the thing is I go up,
I drew,

2169
01:58:04.430 --> 01:58:07.620
I will have a beer when I get on stage.
I'll drink it fairly fast,

2170
01:58:07.621 --> 01:58:11.220
probably a to sell drinks throughout my show and then I price it.

2171
01:58:11.221 --> 01:58:14.430
And then people send you that on purpose.
Yeah.
Really.
Like David [inaudible],

2172
01:58:14.460 --> 01:58:16.980
David [inaudible] said to me one night in Miami and probably said,

2173
01:58:16.981 --> 01:58:19.950
I was featuring forum.
He said two things when you're featuring,

2174
01:58:20.130 --> 01:58:23.820
you should write all the time.
You should never go up and try to kill.

2175
01:58:23.940 --> 01:58:26.670
You should be writing and writing because no one gives a shit about you.

2176
01:58:26.880 --> 01:58:29.160
And then the second thing he said is when you do get headlining,

2177
01:58:29.370 --> 01:58:33.660
remember you are there to sell drinks like as much as you want to do your art,

2178
01:58:33.870 --> 01:58:34.890
the more drinks you sell,

2179
01:58:34.891 --> 01:58:37.980
the more appetizing you are to the club and the club will bring you back.

2180
01:58:37.981 --> 01:58:40.980
If your bar sales are high,
doesn't matter what your ticket prices are.
Whoa.

2181
01:58:41.020 --> 01:58:44.230
So I literally just went on stage and I remember an intel would be like,

2182
01:58:44.290 --> 01:58:46.240
he bring up,
he wouldn't even bring a drink.

2183
01:58:46.241 --> 01:58:48.880
Most of the times you bring up like a,
he'd have them send you.
I mean,

2184
01:58:48.881 --> 01:58:52.000
what are I want to get behind that tells theories on drinking on stage or what?

2185
01:58:52.210 --> 01:58:53.770
But I would just go up and drink a beer.

2186
01:58:53.860 --> 01:58:56.290
So let's say we could figure what you mean complete what you were saying.

2187
01:58:56.291 --> 01:58:58.690
He would bring up shots.
I don't know.
No,
he doesn't drink.

2188
01:58:58.691 --> 01:59:01.150
So I guess you can say it.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
He's pretty open about it.

2189
01:59:01.180 --> 01:59:05.080
He wouldn't drink shots.
He would drink.
It would be like coffee.
Yeah.
Oh,

2190
01:59:05.081 --> 01:59:07.930
he would fake it.
Yeah.
Oh Wow.
But you didn't drink now.

2191
01:59:07.931 --> 01:59:10.090
So I don't think he gives a shit.
But he was telling me,
he's like,

2192
01:59:10.091 --> 01:59:11.590
you gotta be sub menu,
it'd be working up there.

2193
01:59:11.860 --> 01:59:15.190
Like that was to tell it tell it was never a fucking drunk on stage.
So,

2194
01:59:15.191 --> 01:59:17.800
but I would go up and I still do it.
I mean I can bring a lot of beers.

2195
01:59:18.040 --> 01:59:20.860
I can go up now and I'll usually what I'll do is I'll play a song that's

2196
01:59:20.861 --> 01:59:25.240
inspiring me.
Like,
cause I,
you know,
you get bored doing a lot of roadwork.

2197
01:59:26.190 --> 01:59:30.490
One was his song alcohol pussy and we'd buy the Mga Mjb Dna Pol just fucking

2198
01:59:30.491 --> 01:59:35.260
great.
Just first 30 cents a song,
alcohol,
pussy in weed,

2199
01:59:35.650 --> 01:59:39.620
alcohol,
Pussy.
And we did that.
Got you fired up for a shuttle.
And it would just,

2200
01:59:39.670 --> 01:59:42.190
and it was also because I was having family friendly people come out and it

2201
01:59:42.191 --> 01:59:44.800
would set the stage.
So then the,
um,

2202
01:59:45.550 --> 01:59:49.810
the second song I do with this song by maximum Ludwig and the Santa Fe seven,

2203
01:59:49.811 --> 01:59:50.740
it was really great song.

2204
01:59:51.010 --> 01:59:54.670
And then now I go out and listen to black Betty by Ram jam.

2205
01:59:55.210 --> 01:59:59.620
And then as the song plays,
I'll maybe fucking throw off his shirt,
pound a beer.

2206
02:00:00.150 --> 02:00:03.960
<v 4>Whoa,
Whoa,
Bam,
Bam,</v>

2207
02:00:05.080 --> 02:00:09.060
Bam,
Bam,
Bam,
Bam,

2208
02:00:10.530 --> 02:00:11.363
Bam.

2209
02:00:19.010 --> 02:00:21.390
And right now everyone in the crowds fucking love.
And I'm like,

2210
02:00:21.570 --> 02:00:23.520
everyone raise a beer.
We're pattern would be right now.

2211
02:00:23.610 --> 02:00:25.310
And then the whole fucking room was a beer.

2212
02:00:25.430 --> 02:00:29.660
<v 2>We pound it.
And then right there you've just increased the entire barbs staff.</v>

2213
02:00:29.780 --> 02:00:31.610
But the bar bill for the club,
I will five.

2214
02:00:31.670 --> 02:00:33.830
How many dudes are going to slide in the trees on the way home though?

2215
02:00:34.850 --> 02:00:38.750
My cousin fell down a flight of stairs.
He was at that show.
Oh,
that was the one,

2216
02:00:39.160 --> 02:00:43.070
cause then everyone sends shots and like we're talking like,

2217
02:00:43.550 --> 02:00:47.930
like aggressive as the most shots you ever drank on stage.
Oh,

2218
02:00:47.931 --> 02:00:51.580
I couldn't even guess.
I couldn't even,
maybe like,
I dunno,

2219
02:00:51.710 --> 02:00:55.850
take guess more than 10 Oh yeah,
I'm more than 15 no,
no,
no.

2220
02:00:55.851 --> 02:01:00.140
Probably around 10 or 12 I've had a lot of shots on stage before,
but uh,

2221
02:01:00.260 --> 02:01:03.050
and those shows don't,
those shoes are usually more chaotic.

2222
02:01:03.051 --> 02:01:04.550
Like I'd want to tamper recently.

2223
02:01:04.551 --> 02:01:07.100
This was like a really great moment where you're just so drunk you can't

2224
02:01:07.101 --> 02:01:10.820
function.
So I bring,
I bring a black guy on stage and I do an interview,

2225
02:01:14.270 --> 02:01:18.590
great new clothes.
I bring a book,
it's the best,
it's the best.

2226
02:01:18.620 --> 02:01:22.640
You bring a black guy on stage and then one of two things will happen.

2227
02:01:22.670 --> 02:01:25.790
Either you say something totally hilarious or all the white people just applaud

2228
02:01:25.791 --> 02:01:27.050
for what area he says,
right?

2229
02:01:27.760 --> 02:01:29.500
<v 4>He's an engineer.
Yay.
Good for him.</v>

2230
02:01:30.740 --> 02:01:34.510
<v 2>That's what happens.
So I've been this buck on stage and I'm like,
and I,</v>

2231
02:01:34.780 --> 02:01:38.230
I tried to guess what job he did and then I used to have a great one where I

2232
02:01:38.231 --> 02:01:41.780
bring a black Guy Latino on stage and I go,
let's,
I'm going to see it.

2233
02:01:41.810 --> 02:01:44.600
The way I see it.
You say it the way you say it and then I go,

2234
02:01:44.601 --> 02:01:48.410
I would like to take you on a date.
And then the Latino guy will be like,
mummy,

2235
02:01:48.411 --> 02:01:51.860
mummy,
mummy.
And then,
and then the black guy will be like,

2236
02:01:51.920 --> 02:01:55.640
[inaudible] get some commissary.
Shit,
we do like a bunch.

2237
02:01:55.641 --> 02:01:58.010
And the crowd loved it cause they were like,
oh that's right.

2238
02:01:58.011 --> 02:01:59.690
The white guys nerdy.
And then had always close with,
all right,

2239
02:01:59.780 --> 02:02:00.540
how about this one?

2240
02:02:00.540 --> 02:02:03.320
I'd like to apply for a home loan and I give it to the black guy.
And he's like,

2241
02:02:03.350 --> 02:02:07.370
oh,
it was great.
It was great.
So I bring this blackout stage in Tampa and um,

2242
02:02:08.570 --> 02:02:11.740
I said to him,
I go,
I don't,
I'm at a loss.
We're having a great moment.
Taught,

2243
02:02:11.750 --> 02:02:12.680
making jokes,
any.

2244
02:02:12.710 --> 02:02:16.550
Then you can slide whatever jokes you do have in your pocket into that moment.

2245
02:02:16.670 --> 02:02:20.030
Looks Improv place fucking flips out.
Like I tell him,
Oh,

2246
02:02:20.031 --> 02:02:22.400
you remind me and my black friend and he's like,
oh,
you got a black friend?

2247
02:02:22.401 --> 02:02:25.770
I'm like,
yeah,
his name's imaginary.
And so then just Bam,
right off the gates.

2248
02:02:26.060 --> 02:02:29.090
So then,
so then I tell her the bike,
I go,
what do you want to do?
And he goes,

2249
02:02:29.091 --> 02:02:32.750
let's sing a song.
I go,
really?
He's like,
yeah.
I go,
okay.
I go,

2250
02:02:32.751 --> 02:02:35.510
what song do you want to sing?
And he goes,
journey's don't stop believing.

2251
02:02:36.170 --> 02:02:39.260
I was like,
all right.
I go,
do you have that in the Dj booth?

2252
02:02:39.350 --> 02:02:42.530
So they start playing it right.
And so now it's me and the black guy singing,

2253
02:02:42.531 --> 02:02:44.180
don't stop believing back and forth.

2254
02:02:44.270 --> 02:02:47.750
Just a small town girl and he knows all the words and it's killing.

2255
02:02:47.900 --> 02:02:48.431
Then I held him,

2256
02:02:48.431 --> 02:02:52.280
I got the music and the whole crowd starts singing and it's like,

2257
02:02:52.340 --> 02:02:56.810
just this like living in a lonely world.
She,

2258
02:02:56.980 --> 02:02:57.890
and you can literally,

2259
02:02:57.891 --> 02:03:00.530
we would cut the music and then we'll have it turned back on and everyone's

2260
02:03:00.531 --> 02:03:03.330
right on time.
And then at the end of the show it's me in the black,

2261
02:03:03.331 --> 02:03:06.950
I know music and the crowd's still singing and it's like do it soft and then you

2262
02:03:06.951 --> 02:03:11.810
get your 350 people go just to smell like dog stop.

2263
02:03:12.390 --> 02:03:15.290
He then,
and then I'm like,
dude,
isn't it in a Mexican accent?

2264
02:03:15.380 --> 02:03:17.450
And then the whole crowd's stop.

2265
02:03:17.650 --> 02:03:22.040
But Lehman and then the black guys doing it one more time.
Shirts,
his shirts off,

2266
02:03:22.041 --> 02:03:24.890
right.
And then the whole crowd sings.
I grabbed his leather jacket,

2267
02:03:25.030 --> 02:03:27.050
throw it on his shoulders.
I'm like,
we're done.

2268
02:03:27.140 --> 02:03:31.160
And the you just that moment you can never recreate that.
You can't recapture it.

2269
02:03:31.161 --> 02:03:33.980
You can't try to do it again.
Yeah.
That's live performance.

2270
02:03:33.981 --> 02:03:38.510
Just being in that moment and being 10 shots in and going,
I don't fuck it.

2271
02:03:38.750 --> 02:03:43.490
Fuck it.
I,
this can't end bad.
But yeah,
those are those moments.
And then,

2272
02:03:43.580 --> 02:03:44.211
but here's the problem.

2273
02:03:44.211 --> 02:03:48.240
Then you get addicted to those moments and then you sometimes like,
okay,

2274
02:03:48.310 --> 02:03:48.531
I've got,

2275
02:03:48.531 --> 02:03:51.650
there's like 90 year old woman off stage and we were dancing to alcohol,

2276
02:03:51.651 --> 02:03:55.520
Pussy and weed and I've got her pinned like donkey style,

2277
02:03:55.521 --> 02:03:56.900
like my hands on the ground.

2278
02:03:57.170 --> 02:04:00.290
My legs are up over her shoulders and she's just going like this.

2279
02:04:00.291 --> 02:04:03.530
And then you get addicted to that and you want to create that and you'd stopped

2280
02:04:03.531 --> 02:04:07.880
doing stand up.
She was doing that to you.
It's online.
Just play bigger.
Her,
her,

2281
02:04:07.940 --> 02:04:10.610
she was here to see you and your legs were over her shoulders.

2282
02:04:10.611 --> 02:04:13.160
It's really hard to explain.
Okay,
I'll see it.
I'll look for it.

2283
02:04:13.190 --> 02:04:17.030
But it's just I've been,
uh,
I want to hear more though.
Just tell me more.
Um,
yeah,

2284
02:04:17.031 --> 02:04:20.420
so then,
but you get addicted to those moments,
right?
Cause then,

2285
02:04:20.600 --> 02:04:24.530
then like what happens is like you have the story that may be a comic,

2286
02:04:24.531 --> 02:04:27.050
tells another comic.
When Bert was in Miami,

2287
02:04:27.220 --> 02:04:30.590
this m three gangbangers showed their Dick and then other comments,
you're like,

2288
02:04:30.591 --> 02:04:32.000
dude,
I can't wait to work with you.

2289
02:04:32.001 --> 02:04:35.180
I want to see work because I hear what you do.
And you're like,
and you're like,

2290
02:04:35.181 --> 02:04:37.840
I don't do that all the time.
But like it feels,

2291
02:04:38.410 --> 02:04:41.250
then you feel pressure and then you go to a set at the Hollywood improv and it's

2292
02:04:41.251 --> 02:04:45.360
just fucking eight minutes of material and you're like,
that was uninspiring.

2293
02:04:45.361 --> 02:04:48.270
I mean,
don't get me wrong.
You have those moments where like,

2294
02:04:48.450 --> 02:04:51.330
like those Oh shit moments where you just like,

2295
02:04:51.360 --> 02:04:53.010
this will never fucking happen like this.
Yeah.

2296
02:04:53.300 --> 02:04:53.631
<v 3>Right.</v>

2297
02:04:53.631 --> 02:04:56.360
And those are moments too when you're doing like an hour on stage and they get

2298
02:04:56.361 --> 02:05:00.670
to know you and you're really in the groove with the crowd on a lot already

2299
02:05:00.770 --> 02:05:02.300
<v 2>best.
Like,
this is an,</v>

2300
02:05:02.301 --> 02:05:05.000
I give this to any comic listening if you ever need to do this.

2301
02:05:05.120 --> 02:05:08.120
Cause sometimes you get,
you get that reputation and then they go,

2302
02:05:08.330 --> 02:05:10.790
you go to a club and they're like,
listen,
we've got a marriage we want,

2303
02:05:10.791 --> 02:05:13.880
they want to propose on stage.
We told them it was cool with you.
Listen,

2304
02:05:13.910 --> 02:05:16.010
it's a shit dick moment,
but here's what you do.

2305
02:05:16.130 --> 02:05:19.310
I've given this to every comic that wants to use it.
It's brilliant.

2306
02:05:19.520 --> 02:05:22.160
It count came in the moment I was had like four shots,
Tequila.

2307
02:05:22.520 --> 02:05:24.680
I had a guy I want to pose to his check.
This is what you do.

2308
02:05:24.950 --> 02:05:27.170
Bring them both up on stage to do a shot of Tequila.
Okay.

2309
02:05:27.171 --> 02:05:30.770
The guy knows he's proposing you don't worry about that.
Can almost age.

2310
02:05:30.890 --> 02:05:32.450
And then you tell the girl,
we're going to play a game.

2311
02:05:32.780 --> 02:05:35.720
We're gonna blindfold you and you're gonna have to feel our chests.

2312
02:05:35.870 --> 02:05:39.560
Just start chest and tell which one's your husband and which ones me.

2313
02:05:39.770 --> 02:05:42.680
And then she's like,
okay,
so you blindfold her right?

2314
02:05:42.950 --> 02:05:47.300
Then you'd tell the dude now and so he gets on his knee with the ring and then

2315
02:05:47.301 --> 02:05:49.550
you just release the blindfold.
Dude,

2316
02:05:49.610 --> 02:05:53.600
you want to talk about 200 people like crying,
like Oh my God,

2317
02:05:53.750 --> 02:05:57.230
the perfect setup.
And it's such an easy way to get out of that.
Like,

2318
02:05:57.231 --> 02:05:59.510
cause a lot of times when you're young comic,
the manager just be like,

2319
02:05:59.690 --> 02:06:02.300
they're give me 500 bucks just to make sure he proposes to her.

2320
02:06:02.660 --> 02:06:04.790
So if you're a comic and you ever get stuck in that situation,

2321
02:06:04.970 --> 02:06:07.910
feel free to use it.
It's how I did it and it killed.

2322
02:06:08.220 --> 02:06:11.190
<v 3>There's now what did you do after that though?
Just get all fucking stage.</v>

2323
02:06:12.770 --> 02:06:16.310
Someone played back to you.
She made a book called Bert Kreischer Exit Strategy.

2324
02:06:19.250 --> 02:06:22.460
Well those are awesome man.
Dude,
thank you very much for coming on the show,
man.

2325
02:06:22.470 --> 02:06:23.340
You're fucking hilarious.

2326
02:06:23.341 --> 02:06:26.390
He's one of the most fun podcast I've ever had me to know.

2327
02:06:26.400 --> 02:06:29.040
And knowing that you enjoyed listening to it and now you're on it and you

2328
02:06:29.041 --> 02:06:31.890
probably made one of the best ones we've ever had.
I won't listen to this one,

2329
02:06:31.891 --> 02:06:35.310
but I can't wait.
I can't wait.
You can't tell the Tracy Morgan Morgan story.

2330
02:06:35.370 --> 02:06:38.810
I'm going to tell him.
Of course.
I just tell the Tracy Morgan and Morgan,

2331
02:06:38.820 --> 02:06:42.130
we're going to end on this thanks to the fleshlight.
Uh,
go to,
uh,

2332
02:06:42.150 --> 02:06:45.000
Joe rogan.net entering the flashlight.
The thing,

2333
02:06:45.001 --> 02:06:49.770
it's like Rogan is the code name and you get 15% off.
I'm in February 4th.

2334
02:06:49.771 --> 02:06:54.360
We're at the Mandalay Bay theater.
It's me,
Joey Diaz and Ari Shaffir.

2335
02:06:54.361 --> 02:06:57.690
That's like a three headliner combo there.
And then next weekend,

2336
02:06:57.691 --> 02:06:59.070
not this one coming up,
but next week.

2337
02:06:59.071 --> 02:07:02.730
And I'm at the West Palm Beach Improv the 28th,
29th and 30th.

2338
02:07:02.731 --> 02:07:05.490
And that is also with young and talented Ari Shaffir.

2339
02:07:05.940 --> 02:07:08.250
So tell him what the fuck happened with Tracy Morgan.

2340
02:07:08.370 --> 02:07:10.590
<v 2>Okay,
I'll preface this.</v>

2341
02:07:10.591 --> 02:07:14.010
I want to be safe and prefaces that my buddy Jay Moore does tell this on stage.

2342
02:07:14.040 --> 02:07:17.340
We have an agreement.
He's my friend.
He's not a thief.
Okay,
that's,
I just want,

2343
02:07:17.610 --> 02:07:20.130
I know that Jay is concerned about that,

2344
02:07:20.131 --> 02:07:22.290
but he told me he's not telling the story anymore.

2345
02:07:22.500 --> 02:07:25.650
And it did happen to me as long.
I mean this is a true story is a true story.

2346
02:07:25.910 --> 02:07:29.820
True Story.
So as a young comic working in at the Boston Comedy Club,

2347
02:07:30.130 --> 02:07:32.120
we're in the door in New York,
in New York.
Yeah.

2348
02:07:32.130 --> 02:07:34.710
And I used to party with all the black comics because they,

2349
02:07:34.760 --> 02:07:39.760
well cause I don't do you like to and so we uh,

2350
02:07:41.350 --> 02:07:43.750
we used to have a good time and so then um,

2351
02:07:43.980 --> 02:07:46.410
one night Tracy Morgan comes in is when he's starting to get back into standup

2352
02:07:46.420 --> 02:07:49.820
after SNL.
So like when you were young comic and a new celebrity coming,

2353
02:07:49.870 --> 02:07:52.060
you like had to see that shit had to,

2354
02:07:52.330 --> 02:07:56.530
so I go in and I watched Tracy set and it is not,
we have nothing in common.

2355
02:07:56.650 --> 02:08:00.820
He's doing an observational material and is observational material is like,

2356
02:08:01.150 --> 02:08:03.730
all right,
you okay?
Okay.

2357
02:08:03.880 --> 02:08:08.440
Who Remembers Vinco fucking bout a handball courts.
And I'm just like,

2358
02:08:08.560 --> 02:08:10.360
and he thinks that's a shared experience.

2359
02:08:10.361 --> 02:08:13.000
Like losing a sock in the dryer but like everyone else.

2360
02:08:13.060 --> 02:08:14.350
And then he walks you through it.
He's like,

2361
02:08:14.560 --> 02:08:16.780
you put that bitch up against the wall,
just pussy pop.

2362
02:08:16.781 --> 02:08:19.630
That bitch wouldn't even kiss a,
put your arm and your own stank.

2363
02:08:19.780 --> 02:08:23.590
And now you have a visualization of like precious getting boxed out at a

2364
02:08:23.591 --> 02:08:24.490
handball court,

2365
02:08:24.580 --> 02:08:28.960
making eye contact with passer by just getting her buzzy blown out by Tracy

2366
02:08:28.960 --> 02:08:33.760
Morgan.
He goes on stage and he's like,
fucking,
yeah,

2367
02:08:34.240 --> 02:08:37.780
I hit that man.
I got this new bit about my dick being so pretty out.

2368
02:08:37.781 --> 02:08:42.370
You can still go with the lights on,
which is a genius statement.

2369
02:08:42.910 --> 02:08:47.830
I never had a blowjob in the light,
but he just didn't word it right.
Right.
So

2370
02:08:49.940 --> 02:08:53.890
the lights on.
So he,
um,

2371
02:08:53.891 --> 02:08:58.450
so he goes,
he,
uh,
so then he goes,
oh,
you want to get high?

2372
02:08:58.451 --> 02:08:59.320
And I was like,
yeah,

2373
02:08:59.410 --> 02:09:03.340
and because I'm a grown up and so we walk around the corner and he pulls out

2374
02:09:03.341 --> 02:09:06.880
this wreck of a joint hands.
It to me,
hits it and it gives it to me.

2375
02:09:06.881 --> 02:09:11.140
I hit it and it tastes like shit.
It tastes like sweat socks.
Like just,
just like,

2376
02:09:12.040 --> 02:09:14.440
and I'm like,
what the fuck is this?
And he's like,
oh,

2377
02:09:14.441 --> 02:09:17.530
you never smoked a sherm before.
And I was like,
what?
He's like,
show her,

2378
02:09:17.550 --> 02:09:21.400
maybe angel does PCB,
you'll never smoked Sharon before.
And I'm like,

2379
02:09:21.550 --> 02:09:23.910
you just came to fucking like,

2380
02:09:24.100 --> 02:09:28.930
how did you know who ever taught you how to get high?
So I panicked.
Bad,

2381
02:09:28.931 --> 02:09:30.880
like hardcore anxiety attack.
I go back to the club,

2382
02:09:31.060 --> 02:09:34.480
I'd go to this older black comic who's was instilled as one of my good friends.

2383
02:09:34.690 --> 02:09:39.220
And I go,
hey man,
Tracy just gave me PCP.
He's like,
Oh,
oh,

2384
02:09:39.250 --> 02:09:42.160
let me tell you something.
Shawty Tracy done smoked PCP.

2385
02:09:42.161 --> 02:09:45.000
He's not fees fucking with you.
I was like,
when he's up,
he's got,

2386
02:09:45.020 --> 02:09:47.830
he's just smoking pot.
He's fucking with you though.
He's just getting your head.

2387
02:09:48.040 --> 02:09:49.870
And I was like,
no,
I smoked PCP.
I'm feeling weird.
And he goes,

2388
02:09:50.020 --> 02:09:53.410
whatever you do shoty don't go to your house.
You hang out with us tonight.

2389
02:09:53.440 --> 02:09:56.470
So I'm like,
all right.
So I do my set,
I bomb.
We all go out.

2390
02:09:56.471 --> 02:10:01.390
And Tracy is in downtown Soho,
like debt,
right on house.

2391
02:10:01.391 --> 02:10:05.200
Tim Wright and he's in a club that is like one of those railroad clubs where it

2392
02:10:05.201 --> 02:10:08.200
goes all the way back.
You have to like walk down five spice,

2393
02:10:08.260 --> 02:10:11.170
a flight of five stairs to get to and he's in the back.

2394
02:10:11.171 --> 02:10:14.660
He's been there like 20 minutes and he is holding court with his shirt off.
Okay.

2395
02:10:14.920 --> 02:10:18.910
Shirt off,
bottles of champagne covering his table.

2396
02:10:18.970 --> 02:10:21.910
There's other tables that have champagne on it.
He's buying it for them.

2397
02:10:22.060 --> 02:10:25.420
I buy her a bottle of champagne right now.
I've got a pretty Dick,

2398
02:10:25.421 --> 02:10:27.310
like just Eddie Murphy gave me this,

2399
02:10:27.311 --> 02:10:30.400
whatever the fuck he's saying is like loud and boisterous.

2400
02:10:30.401 --> 02:10:33.190
So I sit at the table and I'm thinking I'm on PCP.

2401
02:10:33.380 --> 02:10:37.820
And I started ordering Heineken separately from this wreck of a bar tab he has.

2402
02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.760
And so I'm getting Heinekens and then the whole night goes through,

2403
02:10:40.761 --> 02:10:43.040
it's kind of an interesting,
bizarre experience,

2404
02:10:43.280 --> 02:10:45.430
but like two o'clock in the morning and uh,

2405
02:10:45.650 --> 02:10:49.640
Tracy and the waitress comes up and she got the bill and she puts it in front of

2406
02:10:49.641 --> 02:10:52.160
me because I'm at a table with all black dudes.

2407
02:10:52.520 --> 02:10:55.550
So she thinks on their agent or lawyer or coach,
whatever I am.

2408
02:10:55.730 --> 02:10:58.580
So she gives me the bill and I see it.
I'm like,
oh,
I can't end.

2409
02:10:58.581 --> 02:11:01.970
Tracy Morgan flips out and he goes,
oh,
what the fuck is that?

2410
02:11:02.030 --> 02:11:06.110
That's fucking racism.
You give it to him.
He works the Goddamn dog.

2411
02:11:06.170 --> 02:11:06.890
He doesn't new,
Ain't,

2412
02:11:06.890 --> 02:11:11.090
don't make any money on the rich mobile fucking here I'm on TV.
I'm the ritual,

2413
02:11:11.091 --> 02:11:14.810
the fuck.
And he flips the bottle of champagne table upside down.

2414
02:11:14.840 --> 02:11:17.090
Now the woman's like uncertain sir.
And he goes,
hey.

2415
02:11:17.090 --> 02:11:20.330
And he takes his shirt and throws it in her face,
a bouncer,

2416
02:11:20.331 --> 02:11:22.010
it comes up and he's like,
excuse me sir.

2417
02:11:22.011 --> 02:11:26.330
And Tracy just wham lays the guy in the biggest fight I've ever been in just

2418
02:11:26.331 --> 02:11:30.440
breaks out all over.
People are fighting,
jumping on.
And I think I'm on PCP.

2419
02:11:30.500 --> 02:11:33.500
So I walk out on Houseton and I start going,
this isn't happening.

2420
02:11:33.620 --> 02:11:37.400
This is the imaginary,
this is not real.
People are flooding out left and right.

2421
02:11:37.520 --> 02:11:38.990
And they're like,
dude,
that shit's going off.

2422
02:11:38.991 --> 02:11:42.530
Trees has got like four dudes on him.
And I was like,
Holy Shit.
A minute later,

2423
02:11:42.531 --> 02:11:47.450
the doors kicked open and Tracy Morgan is launched out of the club by the back

2424
02:11:47.451 --> 02:11:51.140
of his neck and the seat of his pants just up onto the street shirt on him.

2425
02:11:51.141 --> 02:11:55.910
No up on the street,
shirtless laying at my feet on the sidewalk.
Doors close.

2426
02:11:55.970 --> 02:12:00.970
Second later door's kicked back open and Tracy's shirt comes out and over end

2427
02:12:01.370 --> 02:12:04.790
and lands on his head and it's silent and we're looking at Tracy like,
fuck,

2428
02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:08.480
this is crazy.
All of a sudden he looks up,
stands up,
takes a shirt,
snaps it,

2429
02:12:08.481 --> 02:12:10.520
and he goes,
now that's how you get out of paying a check.

2430
02:12:14.830 --> 02:12:16.630
<v 9>This guy's crazy.
Like a Fox.</v>

2431
02:12:18.100 --> 02:12:23.100
He fucking to walk in with a $6,000 parttime shit getting kicked out of the

2432
02:12:24.050 --> 02:12:24.883
park.

2433
02:12:25.510 --> 02:12:28.030
<v 2>But you really did that.
That's all.
That's awesome.</v>

2434
02:12:28.140 --> 02:12:31.260
Did he ever have to pay for it?
Whatever.
I have no idea.
I never,
I do.

2435
02:12:31.270 --> 02:12:33.500
Here's the thing.
I'll admit.
Only met Tracy wants

2436
02:12:35.770 --> 02:12:37.510
you don't hang out with a dude.
More than that.

2437
02:12:38.230 --> 02:12:41.900
I would never leave that guy side would have to be.
I

2438
02:12:45.430 --> 02:12:48.580
didn't have kids,
I was just,
I was just like,
like Jay used to tell,

2439
02:12:48.590 --> 02:12:49.061
I was telling you,

2440
02:12:49.061 --> 02:12:52.540
Jay used to tell a story that had happened to me when we do stand up and man

2441
02:12:52.541 --> 02:12:53.770
like people would be like,
get outta here.

2442
02:12:53.771 --> 02:12:58.150
But like I don't know Tracy and I doubt he remembers the night at all.

2443
02:12:58.151 --> 02:12:59.560
Fuck.
And I'm like,

2444
02:12:59.561 --> 02:13:01.750
and you know how stories go in your head when you start telling them a lot.

2445
02:13:01.900 --> 02:13:03.790
Then you like shorten it and tighten it.

2446
02:13:04.520 --> 02:13:07.720
And I've been telling that to comics for like 12 years.
Ever since had happened.

2447
02:13:08.040 --> 02:13:11.440
It was a stand up to stand up for like two months.
That's hilarious.
No,

2448
02:13:11.441 --> 02:13:15.060
you weren't on PCP.
You just thought you were.
I wouldn't know.
I don't know.
I was,

2449
02:13:15.120 --> 02:13:19.120
I was probably strong.
We'd probably strongly,
I dealt with his,
he smoked PCP.

2450
02:13:19.121 --> 02:13:23.770
I've heard him on NPR interview saying he's never done drugs.
And I can,
I mean,

2451
02:13:23.771 --> 02:13:25.450
I don't know.
I've never done drugs.

2452
02:13:25.600 --> 02:13:29.200
He said on NPR piece something that you would probably tell the person,

2453
02:13:29.201 --> 02:13:34.020
even if you were at CP user a thing is Tracy,
Tracy's got that.

2454
02:13:34.021 --> 02:13:39.021
Like I would say that like prison mentality of like he'd rather fuck with you

2455
02:13:39.211 --> 02:13:40.700
then really fuck you up.
Right?
Right.

2456
02:13:40.740 --> 02:13:43.390
Like I think you'd rather get in your head then like fuck you.

2457
02:13:43.410 --> 02:13:45.720
I don't think he's a mirror and mean spirited person.
He's just playing.

2458
02:13:45.750 --> 02:13:46.860
He's just playing with you and then,

2459
02:13:46.890 --> 02:13:50.040
and then I'm the one white guy hanging out with all black comics and so then

2460
02:13:50.041 --> 02:13:53.970
that's funny that he thinks he's on PCP.
That's great.
But the best.

2461
02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:55.910
That's a fucking fantastic story,
dude.

2462
02:13:56.190 --> 02:13:58.110
That was one of the funny stories over the next time.

2463
02:13:58.111 --> 02:14:00.780
I'll tell you about when I was in the Russian mob and we wrote robbed a train.

2464
02:14:01.270 --> 02:14:04.140
Really?
It's a true story,
but I'm not going to tell it now.
Okay,
dude,

2465
02:14:04.141 --> 02:14:06.240
you're coming back again soon.
Definitely.
