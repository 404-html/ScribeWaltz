<v Speaker 1>Every day life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Four,</v>

2
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:06.240
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

3
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:07.103
<v Speaker 1>one five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're here with the Arnold </v>

4
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.390
<v Speaker 1>Schwarzenegger of competence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mary Lynn Rice Cup.</v>

5
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:12.623
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many people have ever on one shot </v>

6
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.430
<v Speaker 1>spelled your name right or pronounced it</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

7
00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:18.960
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never,</v>

8
00:00:18.961 --> 00:00:19.591
<v Speaker 1>never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never.</v>

9
00:00:19.591 --> 00:00:20.424
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're at the DMV now that you </v>

10
00:00:21.151 --> 00:00:23.370
<v Speaker 1>mentioned it because they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>introduce me and it's just,</v>

11
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just gives like an instant obstacle.</v>

12
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.390
<v Speaker 1>Like when you were coming up as a comic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that had to be a big issue for the MC to</v>

13
00:00:32.521 --> 00:00:33.770
<v Speaker 1>bring you up or the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

14
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.800
<v Speaker 1>the Dj when they bring you up as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were the MC or the DJ or the MC.</v>

15
00:00:39.001 --> 00:00:40.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never really looked at it that way.</v>

16
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.950
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody had an inner introduce you.</v>

17
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.853
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

18
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.110
<v Speaker 1>Like I think I was in such a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

19
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.640
<v Speaker 1>a bubble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really,</v>

20
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.220
<v Speaker 1>and I wasn't on the road hardcore and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't,</v>

21
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

22
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.180
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't identifying with me as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>performer so much.</v>

23
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:00.563
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means I was doing performance art </v>

24
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.500
<v Speaker 1>and people were laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know why they were laughing.</v>

25
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.320
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I moved to La.</v>

26
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.891
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

27
00:01:10.891 --> 00:01:13.140
<v Speaker 1>let's do shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I didn't know,</v>

28
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.950
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think about it as like you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>introducing me.</v>

29
00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:18.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a performer.</v>

30
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.350
<v Speaker 1>I would say only in the past couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>years if I'd done the road proper.</v>

31
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.350
<v Speaker 1>But I came in the back alley for </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>

32
00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:26.700
<v Speaker 1>for comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

33
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.120
<v Speaker 1>for acting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if I had come to la with a stack of</v>

34
00:01:30.121 --> 00:01:30.960
<v Speaker 1>head shots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

35
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.190
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm ready for acting.</v>

36
00:01:32.191 --> 00:01:35.760
<v Speaker 1>It would've never happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just came with a group of people like,</v>

37
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.470
<v Speaker 1>Oh to do some live shows and like no </v>
<v Speaker 1>business being in La,</v>

38
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.010
<v Speaker 1>no business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just doing weird shows cause that that's</v>

39
00:01:44.011 --> 00:01:44.844
<v Speaker 1>what I was compelled to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I could not have done it had I </v>

40
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.490
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

41
00:01:50.491 --> 00:01:52.800
<v Speaker 1>you're going to do acting and </v>
<v Speaker 1>performing.</v>

42
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.760
<v Speaker 1>Especially not comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I didn't identify with that at all.</v>

43
00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.400
<v Speaker 1>I had to figure out why people were </v>
<v Speaker 1>laughing.</v>

44
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:00.803
<v Speaker 1>That's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you first got into show </v>

45
00:02:02.641 --> 00:02:04.590
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was the goal?</v>

46
00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.550
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird bird show business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't she?</v>

47
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.340
<v Speaker 1>Isn't she a special lady?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

48
00:02:10.341 --> 00:02:11.174
<v Speaker 1>I'm audition ready today by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You notice I have a good brow in a good </v>

49
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.680
<v Speaker 1>eye shadow line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm such a woman.</v>

50
00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm really more of a woman now than I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever been.</v>

51
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.810
<v Speaker 1>What's sad about what's that about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just growing up,</v>

52
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.160
<v Speaker 1>letting it go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>letting it go.</v>

53
00:02:29.161 --> 00:02:30.720
<v Speaker 1>And I look back in my twenties and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

54
00:02:30.721 --> 00:02:35.070
<v Speaker 1>you were up hot bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what was wrong with you?</v>

55
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.720
<v Speaker 1>But I was so incapable of anything like </v>
<v Speaker 1>so socially.</v>

56
00:02:39.721 --> 00:02:41.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean I still am,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm much,</v>

57
00:02:41.311 --> 00:02:43.620
<v Speaker 1>much better now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's awkward,</v>

58
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.880
<v Speaker 1>awkward and just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's um,</v>

59
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't find you awkward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's odd.</v>

60
00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.680
<v Speaker 1>Like every time I've talked to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've had very fun,</v>

61
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.410
<v Speaker 1>comfortable conversations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never found it to be awkward.</v>

62
00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:56.423
<v Speaker 1>I don't find you to be awkward either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we just don't make each other </v>

63
00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:59.733
<v Speaker 1>awkward.</v>

64
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.710
<v Speaker 2>Is that weird?</v>
<v Speaker 2>My mind just went to an instagram APP.</v>

65
00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.860
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was creep tastic in my own mind.</v>

66
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.700
<v Speaker 2>That one that goes in close and it does </v>
<v Speaker 2>the little stars.</v>

67
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.040
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all right.</v>

68
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.060
<v Speaker 2>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't find you to be awkward.</v>

69
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.190
<v Speaker 2>Every time I've ever talked to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been very,</v>

70
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.170
<v Speaker 2>very comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very easy.</v>

71
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.843
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I would also say that's kind of a </v>

72
00:03:23.231 --> 00:03:24.064
<v Speaker 2>recent development that you and I are </v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking was when I started coming back </v>

73
00:03:29.321 --> 00:03:31.210
<v Speaker 2>to the comedy store,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was what,</v>

74
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.850
<v Speaker 2>a couple of years ago?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

75
00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.410
<v Speaker 2>three now I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three something.</v>

76
00:03:35.411 --> 00:03:40.411
<v Speaker 2>14 November of 14 I think it was because</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've been in each other's orbit since,</v>

77
00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>since news radio.</v>

78
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:44.693
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we didn't really get a chance to </v>

79
00:03:45.581 --> 00:03:46.414
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

80
00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.270
<v Speaker 2>hang out or be friends til the store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

81
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.980
<v Speaker 2>That's such an interesting little </v>
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>

82
00:03:50.981 --> 00:03:52.800
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 2>community.</v>

84
00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:56.783

<v Speaker 2>explaining this to someone the other </v>

85
00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.190
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when I first started going there in</v>

86
00:04:00.191 --> 00:04:03.010
<v Speaker 2>1994 there was a lot of conflict between</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedians.</v>

87
00:04:03.011 --> 00:04:04.780
<v Speaker 2>There's like comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It didn't like comedians.</v>

88
00:04:04.781 --> 00:04:05.620
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>million times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you eat,</v>

<v Speaker 2>chunk of time where you stopped for </v>

103
00:04:37.271 --> 00:04:38.460
<v Speaker 2>seven years?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

104
00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:43.110
<v Speaker 2>I stopped for seven years after I had </v>
<v Speaker 2>that dispute with Carlos Rensea.</v>

105
00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:45.443
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was when he was way more popular </v>

106
00:04:48.971 --> 00:04:49.960
<v Speaker 2>than me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

107
00:04:49.961 --> 00:04:53.470
<v Speaker 2>especially as a comic and the comedy </v>
<v Speaker 2>store took his side and I was like,</v>

108

<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck you guys.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I took off.</v>

110
00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.330
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't really the comedy store </v>
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>

111
00:04:58.331 --> 00:05:00.850
<v Speaker 2>It was this one guy who was the manager,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause Mitzi,</v>

112
00:05:00.851 --> 00:05:05.020
<v Speaker 2>actually I called Mitzi and gave her the</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole rundown of what was going on.</v>

113
00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.990
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told her and she's like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>and then they called me up two hours </v>

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.680
<v Speaker 2>Like she gave me a spot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She told me when to go up.</v>

119
00:05:20.681 --> 00:05:22.810
<v Speaker 2>So if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if she's not running the store,</v>

120
00:05:22.811 --> 00:05:26.590
<v Speaker 2>like who's who's deciding on band?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are like,</v>

121
00:05:26.591 --> 00:05:27.424
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing?</v>

122
00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.710
<v Speaker 2>Like do you guys understand what this </v>
<v Speaker 2>is?</v>

123
00:05:29.711 --> 00:05:30.544
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is like a little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're having a little battle for like </v>

124
00:05:32.741 --> 00:05:36.490
<v Speaker 2>whether or not you're going to let </v>
<v Speaker 2>people profit off of crime.</v>

125
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.010
<v Speaker 2>Like this is really what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have thought crime,</v>

126
00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:40.083
<v Speaker 2>he have intellectual crime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you plagiarism and you're allowing one </v>

127
00:05:42.791 --> 00:05:43.624
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you knowingly allowing them to profit </v>

128
00:05:46.031 --> 00:05:48.070
<v Speaker 2>off it and no one's doing anything about</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

129
00:05:48.071 --> 00:05:50.080
<v Speaker 2>So when one of us does something about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

130
00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:54.460
<v Speaker 2>then you're going to punish that person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're basically highlighting everything</v>

131
00:05:54.461 --> 00:05:56.230
<v Speaker 2>that everyone was afraid of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good point.</v>

132
00:05:56.231 --> 00:05:57.830
<v Speaker 2>What is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what were the,</v>

133
00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:01.130
<v Speaker 2>what was the reason for your being </v>
<v Speaker 2>banned because you were,</v>

134
00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.193
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because become their end of it was </v>

135
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:04.573
<v Speaker 2>because we had made a video with me and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Carlos arguing on stage and then we put </v>

136
00:06:09.531 --> 00:06:13.100
<v Speaker 2>it on right now that all that this was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

137
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:13.993
<v Speaker 2>somehow or another and in violation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that should have been kept inside the </v>

138
00:06:15.861 --> 00:06:17.600
<v Speaker 2>club and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't get it.</v>

139
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.270
<v Speaker 2>You weren't protecting us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one was protecting us.</v>

140
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:24.020
<v Speaker 2>My fucking agents dumped me over that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

141
00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:24.861
<v Speaker 2>over that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

142
00:06:24.861 --> 00:06:26.330
<v Speaker 2>I was with gurse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They dropped me.</v>

143
00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:29.570
<v Speaker 2>They'd call me up to tell me they </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially,</v>

144
00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:33.800
<v Speaker 2>in this long roundabout way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're trying to say that I either had to</v>

145
00:06:33.801 --> 00:06:37.680
<v Speaker 2>apologize or they couldn't work with </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore though.</v>

146
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:40.940
<v Speaker 2>That was the gist of it and I had to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make them spell it out.</v>

147
00:06:40.941 --> 00:06:43.960
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me say this really clear.</v>

148
00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:44.990
<v Speaker 2>You tell me if this is what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying.</v>

149
00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:49.850
<v Speaker 2>You're saying you want me to apologize </v>
<v Speaker 2>or you can't work with me anymore?</v>

150
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:51.890
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're done now.</v>

151
00:06:51.891 --> 00:06:54.230
<v Speaker 2>There's no apology and we'll never get </v>
<v Speaker 2>to work together.</v>

152
00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:56.480
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate everything you've done for </v>
<v Speaker 2>me and I,</v>

153
00:06:56.481 --> 00:06:58.760
<v Speaker 2>it was really nice to the guy who was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't his idea.</v>

154
00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:00.830
<v Speaker 2>My agent said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a great guy,</v>

155
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:01.550
<v Speaker 2>bye.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See you.</v>

156
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:02.383
<v Speaker 2>I'm giving you a hug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you guys have to understand that </v>

157
00:07:04.101 --> 00:07:04.934
<v Speaker 2>you're making a choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to affect the rest of your </v>

158
00:07:06.111 --> 00:07:08.270
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This isn't just a small thing.</v>

159
00:07:08.271 --> 00:07:09.590
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you only have a few.</v>

160
00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.600
<v Speaker 2>How many years do you have in this life?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

161
00:07:11.601 --> 00:07:14.420
<v Speaker 2>this year is going to be highlighted by </v>
<v Speaker 2>this decision.</v>

162
00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.940
<v Speaker 2>This is going to be at why the agent </v>
<v Speaker 2>take that stand.</v>

163
00:07:16.941 --> 00:07:18.950
<v Speaker 2>Did they represent him as yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

164
00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:19.950
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

165
00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:20.963
<v Speaker 2>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they needed to make nice with that </v>

166
00:07:22.581 --> 00:07:23.120
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

167
00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.040
<v Speaker 2>it made way more money than me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was,</v>

168
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.130
<v Speaker 2>he was way more valuable to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm like,</v>

169
00:07:28.131 --> 00:07:31.280
<v Speaker 2>you gotta make this is you sell art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all you guys do.</v>

170
00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.830
<v Speaker 2>Can you not making anything?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're just,</v>

171
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:37.670
<v Speaker 2>if Mary Lynn comes up with the show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if this guy has a tour,</v>

172
00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:40.070
<v Speaker 2>if she's doing this or he's writing a </v>
<v Speaker 2>book,</v>

173
00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:43.040
<v Speaker 2>you make money off art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how you make money off.</v>

174
00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:44.113
<v Speaker 2>Now here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know a guy stealing other people's </v>

175
00:07:46.611 --> 00:07:51.611
<v Speaker 2>art and your answer to that is we got to</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop people that are exposing it.</v>

176
00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:56.310
<v Speaker 2>Did he ever change or not that I even </v>
<v Speaker 2>matters him.</v>

177
00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.540
<v Speaker 2>I hope he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got to find Jesus.</v>

178
00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:02.570
<v Speaker 2>We just talking about this last night </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of.</v>

179
00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:03.291
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sort of.</v>

180
00:08:03.291 --> 00:08:04.280
<v Speaker 2>And then he kind of took it back.</v>

181
00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:07.790
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to admit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Should I try?</v>

182
00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:10.880
<v Speaker 2>Should I try?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is insane.</v>

183
00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:12.420
<v Speaker 2>I actually only have like one set,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

184
00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:13.313
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know my friend Tate Tate </v>

185
00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:15.133
<v Speaker 2>Fletcher?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably seen him around the store </v>

186
00:08:15.861 --> 00:08:16.970
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Big giant gorilla.</v>

187
00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:18.170
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's his company.</v>

188
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.330
<v Speaker 2>They're very good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but don't drink the whole thing.</v>

189
00:08:20.331 --> 00:08:21.440
<v Speaker 2>Mary Lynn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like it,</v>

190
00:08:21.441 --> 00:08:24.590
<v Speaker 2>but I'm going to do it if it's a grand </v>
<v Speaker 2>day coffee.</v>

191
00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:25.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's about it.</v>

192
00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:28.490
<v Speaker 2>Chronic and coffees where the caffeine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's strong.</v>

193
00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:29.601
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

194
00:08:29.601 --> 00:08:30.434
<v Speaker 2>she fog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to go work out in your isolation </v>

195
00:08:34.221 --> 00:08:36.260
<v Speaker 2>tank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Find Yourself.</v>

196
00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:40.520
<v Speaker 2>I just found myself and I peed a little.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's okay.</v>

197
00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:41.893
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you started out as a performance </v>

198
00:08:43.161 --> 00:08:44.480
<v Speaker 2>artists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that was your idea.</v>

199
00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.770
<v Speaker 2>What did you want to do that was your </v>
<v Speaker 2>eye?</v>

200
00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:47.633
<v Speaker 2>That was your big idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to art school for painting and I </v>

201
00:08:50.301 --> 00:08:52.420
<v Speaker 2>was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

202
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:55.530
<v Speaker 2>got really frustrated when people </v>
<v Speaker 2>started to,</v>

203
00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:57.153
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>critique the paintings and I was </v>

204
00:08:59.311 --> 00:09:00.210
<v Speaker 3>supposed to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

205
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:01.463
<v Speaker 3>getting more serious in art school and </v>
<v Speaker 3>more conceptual and everyone was doing </v>

206
00:09:05.041 --> 00:09:05.874
<v Speaker 3>something different and everyone was </v>
<v Speaker 3>critiquing it in a different way and </v>

207
00:09:08.041 --> 00:09:13.041
<v Speaker 3>none of it made sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the idea of having to sell that</v>

208
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:17.010
<v Speaker 3>object that you made,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you're going to make something that's</v>

209
00:09:17.011 --> 00:09:17.844
<v Speaker 3>useless.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it makes it sound like I don't </v>

210
00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.600
<v Speaker 3>like our appreciate art.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

211
00:09:21.601 --> 00:09:23.340
<v Speaker 3>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't,</v>

212
00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:26.670
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't grasp what the next thing to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do was.</v>

213
00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:27.870
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're poor,</v>

214
00:09:27.871 --> 00:09:28.704
<v Speaker 3>you're an art school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're making something and then you </v>

215
00:09:30.511 --> 00:09:34.520
<v Speaker 3>have to go sell and market that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

216
00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:35.753
<v Speaker 3>I also was frustrated and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and kind of like boiling inside and </v>

217
00:09:41.041 --> 00:09:41.874
<v Speaker 3>needed to express myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I started doing performance art in </v>

218
00:09:44.821 --> 00:09:47.740
<v Speaker 3>school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when you say performance art,</v>

219
00:09:47.741 --> 00:09:51.090
<v Speaker 3>that's a pretty open ended description.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

220
00:09:51.091 --> 00:09:51.924
<v Speaker 3>it's so open ended.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There were so many like weird </v>

221
00:09:54.271 --> 00:09:56.100
<v Speaker 3>performance art things that would </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>

222
00:09:56.101 --> 00:09:57.930
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we had performance art class,</v>

223
00:09:57.931 --> 00:10:02.160
<v Speaker 3>there was the guy that like taped his </v>
<v Speaker 3>genitals to the side and put on lipstick</v>

224
00:10:02.161 --> 00:10:06.010
<v Speaker 3>in a mirror and that was his performance</v>
<v Speaker 3>art piece or the girl that,</v>

225
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:09.070
<v Speaker 3>and we would all sit there and watch it.</v>

226
00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:11.913
<v Speaker 3>Did you see his genitals?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did he'd go naked and pull it aside or </v>

227
00:10:14.371 --> 00:10:16.770
<v Speaker 3>how did he do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a really good question.</v>

228
00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:19.110
<v Speaker 3>I like how your mind just went there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

229
00:10:19.111 --> 00:10:24.111
<v Speaker 3>what actually happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I blocked it out because I think</v>

230
00:10:24.451 --> 00:10:25.284
<v Speaker 3>you could probably get away with doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that under the guise of it being </v>

231
00:10:27.421 --> 00:10:28.830
<v Speaker 3>something you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

232
00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:30.730
<v Speaker 3>in a class somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

233
00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:33.060
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get away with us.</v>

234
00:10:33.061 --> 00:10:35.730
<v Speaker 3>So pervy I think I was focused on his </v>
<v Speaker 3>beautiful lips.</v>

235
00:10:35.731 --> 00:10:37.860
<v Speaker 3>I was trying to be polite and not look </v>
<v Speaker 3>down there.</v>

236
00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:40.860
<v Speaker 3>Another woman was obese and her piece </v>
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>

237
00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:41.873
<v Speaker 3>she had preset up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We weren't it where she was doing the </v>

238
00:10:43.771 --> 00:10:45.120
<v Speaker 3>performance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

239
00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:47.870
<v Speaker 3>butter pats in like dominoes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>

240
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:50.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a few thousand of them in a line.</v>

241
00:10:50.551 --> 00:10:53.460
<v Speaker 3>And she was obese and she crawled on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ground.</v>

242
00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:57.210
<v Speaker 3>She didn't actually eat them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was something that's weird.</v>

243
00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:00.180
<v Speaker 3>My mind kind of drops off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember specific parts of it,</v>

244
00:11:00.181 --> 00:11:01.014
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think she just was collecting the </v>

245
00:11:02.641 --> 00:11:05.430
<v Speaker 3>butter pieces and crawling and that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>her performance.</v>

246
00:11:05.431 --> 00:11:07.460
<v Speaker 3>He's another guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

247
00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:08.610
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

248
00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:09.443
<v Speaker 3>this was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to Detroit and then finished in </v>

249
00:11:10.741 --> 00:11:11.574
<v Speaker 3>San Francisco.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And San Francisco is known for being a </v>

250
00:11:13.141 --> 00:11:16.860
<v Speaker 3>real performance art history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of the,</v>

251
00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most famous performance artist.</v>

252
00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:22.260
<v Speaker 3>Nobody knows where that was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The scene was in San Francisco.</v>

253
00:11:22.261 --> 00:11:23.094
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

254
00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:25.680
<v Speaker 3>it was two story really beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 3>campus,</v>

255
00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:26.521
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>overlooking.</v>

256
00:11:26.521 --> 00:11:28.410
<v Speaker 3>You could see a Lombard street on one </v>
<v Speaker 3>side.</v>

257
00:11:28.411 --> 00:11:29.730
<v Speaker 3>You could see the water on the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>side.</v>

258
00:11:29.731 --> 00:11:32.730
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another guy's piece was to jump from the</v>

259
00:11:32.731 --> 00:11:37.731
<v Speaker 3>second story to a tree to is like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He may or may not have made the jump and</v>

260
00:11:39.361 --> 00:11:42.290
<v Speaker 3>that was his art,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his art pieces.</v>

261
00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:44.400
<v Speaker 3>Jumping from a window to a tree.</v>

262
00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:46.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck?</v>

263
00:11:46.261 --> 00:11:50.610
<v Speaker 3>I know this other guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the room where we had our class,</v>

264
00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:53.770
<v Speaker 3>he had a bread machine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was back,</v>

265
00:11:53.771 --> 00:11:54.604
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bread machines where new technology had </v>

266
00:11:56.970 --> 00:11:58.990
<v Speaker 3>a breadmaker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know those machines you can make a,</v>

267
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.930
<v Speaker 3>I guess it just does the dough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

268
00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:02.100
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it bakes it.</v>

269
00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:02.973
<v Speaker 3>I think it just needs the dough and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>you bake it or I don't know if you bake </v>

270
00:12:05.531 --> 00:12:07.300
<v Speaker 3>it in the machine or no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you bake it in the machine.</v>

271
00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:09.100
<v Speaker 3>It's all coming back to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He bakes it in the machine.</v>

272
00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:12.110
<v Speaker 3>We come into the classroom as he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>baking it.</v>

273
00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:13.990
<v Speaker 3>There's always like a reveal and these </v>
<v Speaker 3>pieces.</v>

274
00:12:13.991 --> 00:12:15.160
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we come in,</v>

275
00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:19.540
<v Speaker 3>he's taken plaster from the wall and put</v>
<v Speaker 3>it in the bread.</v>

276
00:12:19.541 --> 00:12:23.830
<v Speaker 3>He's Fed us the bread.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Half of us get it,</v>

277
00:12:23.831 --> 00:12:28.720
<v Speaker 3>half of us don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's plaster in the price.</v>

278
00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:33.480
<v Speaker 3>Why did you put plaster in his bread?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was something about communism.</v>

279
00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:40.270
<v Speaker 1>Some get the bread,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some don't.</v>

280
00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:42.960
<v Speaker 1>But even if you get the bread,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's plaster.</v>

281
00:12:42.961 --> 00:12:46.650
<v Speaker 1>And so in your face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

282
00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:48.473
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See there's something about like </v>

283
00:12:50.171 --> 00:12:51.004
<v Speaker 1>performance are in slam poetry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did slam poetry to that was when Mike </v>

284
00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:56.170
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

285
00:12:56.170 --> 00:12:59.840
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the best part is I got Zeros.</v>

286
00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:01.190
<v Speaker 1>Zeros.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

287
00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:05.320
<v Speaker 1>You didn't get any why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never really wrote any poetry.</v>

288
00:13:05.321 --> 00:13:10.110
<v Speaker 1>I was just into the performance of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I see you didn't have to poke.</v>

289
00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:12.280
<v Speaker 1>I was doing comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>

290
00:13:12.281 --> 00:13:16.090
<v Speaker 1>And I was doing like an awkward thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was very real for me,</v>

291
00:13:16.091 --> 00:13:19.430
<v Speaker 1>but I think I just wanted to express my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also had an ex boyfriend who</v>

292
00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:24.120
<v Speaker 3>he said the comedy was his life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was when I was like 19.</v>

293
00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:25.283
<v Speaker 3>And I think I attached to people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I thought he was the shit because </v>

294
00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:30.353
<v Speaker 3>he would be rude to people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that was his version of comedy was </v>

295
00:13:32.851 --> 00:13:33.684
<v Speaker 3>like bossing people around or one of his</v>
<v Speaker 3>bits was like having a whistle and </v>

296
00:13:37.801 --> 00:13:41.010
<v Speaker 3>directing traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean really adolescent like,</v>

297
00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:44.330
<v Speaker 3>but for some reason I was really </v>
<v Speaker 3>attracted to him and uh,</v>

298
00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:46.413
<v Speaker 3>like I wanted to be him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anybody who was like extroverted or </v>

299
00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:52.950
<v Speaker 3>something that I wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I was attracted to that.</v>

300
00:13:52.951 --> 00:13:53.581
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

301
00:13:53.581 --> 00:13:54.870
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he was like,</v>

302
00:13:54.871 --> 00:13:57.630
<v Speaker 3>comedy is my life and I do this open </v>
<v Speaker 3>mic.</v>

303
00:13:57.690 --> 00:13:59.580
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to do that open.</v>

304
00:13:59.581 --> 00:14:00.414
<v Speaker 3>Mike and I had taped like phrases to my </v>
<v Speaker 3>body and phrases from commercials or </v>

305
00:14:06.991 --> 00:14:07.824
<v Speaker 3>snippets of conversation that I had </v>
<v Speaker 3>heard and I went up and I started </v>

306
00:14:11.161 --> 00:14:11.994
<v Speaker 3>reading them and then I would improvise </v>
<v Speaker 3>a little bit and I'd be like waxy build </v>

307
00:14:15.441 --> 00:14:16.274
<v Speaker 3>up or whatever and just repeating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just letting it all filter through and </v>

308
00:14:20.191 --> 00:14:24.180
<v Speaker 3>come out my mouth for five minutes of </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever the open mic was.</v>

309
00:14:24.181 --> 00:14:25.014
<v Speaker 3>And I started getting laughter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was like awkward laughter after </v>

310
00:14:28.741 --> 00:14:31.080
<v Speaker 3>the fact of that uncomfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what?</v>

311
00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:34.230
<v Speaker 3>What is she doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But my commitment level was so high that</v>

312
00:14:34.231 --> 00:14:38.520
<v Speaker 3>the fact that it didn't make any sense </v>
<v Speaker 3>just because laughter.</v>

313
00:14:38.521 --> 00:14:39.061
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

314
00:14:39.061 --> 00:14:39.840
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

315
00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.450
<v Speaker 1>Well that's us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That works sometimes with just even with</v>

316
00:14:42.451 --> 00:14:44.010
<v Speaker 1>comics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

317
00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:45.113
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that are just </v>

318
00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:50.640
<v Speaker 1>really odd and if you saw them you would</v>
<v Speaker 1>get it,</v>

319
00:14:50.641 --> 00:14:52.100
<v Speaker 1>but if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you saw what they</v>

320
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:55.370
<v Speaker 3>wrote on paper is or what they said just</v>
<v Speaker 3>written down on paper,</v>

321
00:14:55.371 --> 00:14:56.204
<v Speaker 3>you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

322
00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:58.190
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

323
00:14:58.191 --> 00:14:59.300
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought you were going to say,</v>

324
00:14:59.301 --> 00:15:01.250
<v Speaker 3>which is a similar point that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

325
00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:04.430
<v Speaker 3>that it comes in the pause and after </v>
<v Speaker 3>what they're saying,</v>

326
00:15:04.431 --> 00:15:07.160
<v Speaker 3>even if it doesn't make any sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're saying sometimes people write</v>

327
00:15:07.161 --> 00:15:10.440
<v Speaker 3>things and it makes its own sense when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you hear them say it,</v>

328
00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:14.170
<v Speaker 3>but it's also just about being fully </v>
<v Speaker 3>commit.</v>

329
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.010
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

330
00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:17.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And those pauses.</v>

331
00:15:17.361 --> 00:15:18.194
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That gives you,</v>

332
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:19.700
<v Speaker 3>especially with something's really </v>
<v Speaker 3>absurd,</v>

333
00:15:19.701 --> 00:15:23.000
<v Speaker 3>gives you that opportunity to go watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

334
00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:25.730
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to just hammer them over </v>
<v Speaker 3>the head with it.</v>

335
00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:30.080
<v Speaker 3>So you just started doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And how did it lead to actual stand up,</v>

336
00:15:30.081 --> 00:15:30.914
<v Speaker 3>stand up?</v>

337
00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:32.223
<v Speaker 4>MMM,</v>

338
00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:33.763
<v Speaker 3>it was a really fun time in San </v>
<v Speaker 3>Francisco because the comedy clubs were </v>

339
00:15:36.051 --> 00:15:36.884
<v Speaker 3>closing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so a lot of comics were coming to these </v>

340
00:15:38.361 --> 00:15:41.300
<v Speaker 3>open mic poetry rooms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of my favorite rooms was in this</v>

341
00:15:41.301 --> 00:15:42.134
<v Speaker 3>bar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also I was from the suburbs of </v>

342
00:15:43.611 --> 00:15:45.680
<v Speaker 3>Detroit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so just being in San Francisco,</v>

343
00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:48.590
<v Speaker 3>that was a real city and a friendly </v>
<v Speaker 3>city,</v>

344
00:15:48.591 --> 00:15:49.424
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's small enough and it's </v>

345
00:15:50.421 --> 00:15:52.790
<v Speaker 3>beautiful and they have a real arts </v>
<v Speaker 3>scene.</v>

346
00:15:52.791 --> 00:15:53.624
<v Speaker 3>And it was the first time that I had </v>
<v Speaker 3>seen like a real counter culture and </v>

347
00:15:56.541 --> 00:15:58.520
<v Speaker 3>people that would hang out in coffee </v>
<v Speaker 3>shops and,</v>

348
00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:01.010
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of young people that looked </v>
<v Speaker 3>like I did.</v>

349
00:16:01.011 --> 00:16:05.210
<v Speaker 3>So I would go to bars for this open mic </v>
<v Speaker 3>and there'd be um,</v>

350
00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:06.643
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I transvestite who was semi </v>

351
00:16:09.051 --> 00:16:10.250
<v Speaker 3>homeless,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was,</v>

352
00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:13.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>made up who was like reading her poetry.</v>

353
00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:16.910
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in like,</v>

354
00:16:16.911 --> 00:16:17.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm done.</v>

355
00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:18.493
<v Speaker 3>And I had no money and I would sit and </v>
<v Speaker 3>crouch on the floor and drink like a </v>

356
00:16:21.201 --> 00:16:22.860
<v Speaker 3>half a beer and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

357
00:16:22.861 --> 00:16:24.170
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those crazy.</v>

358
00:16:24.171 --> 00:16:25.004
<v Speaker 3>And I would watch her read from her </v>
<v Speaker 3>journal and I did a similar thing where </v>

359
00:16:28.191 --> 00:16:29.570
<v Speaker 3>I would just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then it was always,</v>

360
00:16:29.571 --> 00:16:30.404
<v Speaker 3>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know my own mind or my own </v>

361
00:16:31.881 --> 00:16:34.220
<v Speaker 3>thoughts really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I would write down random words and I</v>

362
00:16:34.221 --> 00:16:37.350
<v Speaker 3>would perform it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's still now it's,</v>

363
00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:40.070
<v Speaker 3>I've progressed a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like,</v>

364
00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:43.490
<v Speaker 3>it informs you how the audience reacts </v>
<v Speaker 3>or it begins to,</v>

365
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.930
<v Speaker 3>and I just love seeing all these like </v>
<v Speaker 3>different people and what,</v>

366
00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:48.053
<v Speaker 3>what they thought they were saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>versus what they were really saying and </v>

367
00:16:50.361 --> 00:16:54.500
<v Speaker 3>what they're intended effect was and how</v>
<v Speaker 3>people were really seeing them.</v>

368
00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:55.520
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

369
00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:59.330
<v Speaker 3>so comics started dropping into these </v>
<v Speaker 3>rooms like Patton Oswald and,</v>

370
00:16:59.331 --> 00:17:00.164
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jeremy Kramer and blink a patch and you </v>

371
00:17:03.351 --> 00:17:04.040
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

372
00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:05.520
<v Speaker 3>Greg Bear until these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

373
00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:06.913
<v Speaker 3>Ron Lynch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that were more San Francisco </v>

374
00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:13.550
<v Speaker 3>affiliated that were there at that time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd start doing these open Mike Nights.</v>

375
00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:14.923
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but because a comic is so versed in </v>

376
00:17:18.831 --> 00:17:23.490
<v Speaker 3>their own voice that watching them was </v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

377
00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:24.810
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

378
00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:28.260
<v Speaker 3>that they know how to speak and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>more polished.</v>

379
00:17:28.261 --> 00:17:30.120
<v Speaker 3>And then that was attractive to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

380
00:17:30.121 --> 00:17:30.954
<v Speaker 3>so I kind of gravitated towards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there were all these alternative </v>

381
00:17:34.111 --> 00:17:37.830
<v Speaker 3>rooms that weren't comedy clubs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was like,</v>

382
00:17:37.831 --> 00:17:38.664
<v Speaker 3>I loved that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just loved it because there was room </v>

383
00:17:41.161 --> 00:17:43.710
<v Speaker 3>for mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was room for the in between,</v>

384
00:17:43.711 --> 00:17:44.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like that,</v>

385
00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:49.320
<v Speaker 3>the real allseen of that time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

386
00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:50.010
<v Speaker 3>That all</v>

387
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:50.843
<v Speaker 2>seems interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's always interesting when like a </v>

388
00:17:51.901 --> 00:17:55.110
<v Speaker 2>little branch of a style of comedy </v>
<v Speaker 2>breaks off,</v>

389
00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:56.513
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And some people do it because that's </v>

390
00:17:59.611 --> 00:18:01.800
<v Speaker 2>like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it feels more true to them.</v>

391
00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:02.783
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then some people do it because it </v>

392
00:18:03.631 --> 00:18:08.610
<v Speaker 2>seems like the cool hip thing to do and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then some people it's just a combination</v>

393
00:18:08.611 --> 00:18:09.444
<v Speaker 2>of bolts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

394
00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:11.880
<v Speaker 2>The all teens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>An interesting scene,</v>

395
00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:13.433
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause it also is attached to that one </v>

396
00:18:14.791 --> 00:18:15.990
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't pay anybody.</v>

397
00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:18.270
<v Speaker 2>The UCB.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

398
00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:19.590
<v Speaker 2>I was always like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

399
00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:20.513
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh you mean cause they're making money </v>

400
00:18:21.991 --> 00:18:23.310
<v Speaker 2>and no one else's Nikki.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

401
00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:25.290
<v Speaker 2>I was always like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

402
00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:29.220
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how does that make sense?</v>

403
00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:31.950
<v Speaker 2>People don't get paid at comedy clubs as</v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

404
00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:34.260
<v Speaker 2>Well sure they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Comedy store pays you,</v>

405
00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:37.290
<v Speaker 2>you mean like 25 bucks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>25 bucks for regular sets.</v>

406
00:18:37.291 --> 00:18:38.730
<v Speaker 2>And then do you get a lot more than </v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

407
00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:41.190
<v Speaker 2>If you do the main room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the main room,</v>

408
00:18:41.191 --> 00:18:42.220
<v Speaker 2>they pay your real money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're saying,</v>

409
00:18:42.221 --> 00:18:47.221
<v Speaker 2>why doesn't ucb throw 25 bucks to people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you have to pay if something people</v>

410
00:18:47.431 --> 00:18:48.660
<v Speaker 2>are paying to go there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

411
00:18:48.661 --> 00:18:50.940
<v Speaker 2>Paying for gas there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're traveling,</v>

412
00:18:50.941 --> 00:18:51.774
<v Speaker 2>they're right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're selling tickets to see them </v>

413
00:18:53.281 --> 00:18:54.270
<v Speaker 2>do their art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

414
00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:55.213
<v Speaker 2>That's how it ain't to take that line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then everybody should be paid a lot </v>

415
00:18:58.021 --> 00:19:00.180
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There should be genuine percentage.</v>

416
00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:01.043
<v Speaker 2>It's really only the comics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Going back to that argument from a </v>

417
00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:07.350
<v Speaker 2>comedy store from the 70s that was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a legit argument.</v>

418
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:10.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not legit that,</v>

419
00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:10.883
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is where we live and it's a really </v>

420
00:19:12.001 --> 00:19:13.560
<v Speaker 2>important place to work out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

421
00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:14.543
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we need it and we want it to be </v>

422
00:19:15.541 --> 00:19:16.290
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

423
00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:19.110
<v Speaker 2>And they pay you a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if they didn't pay you anything,</v>

424
00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:22.470
<v Speaker 2>like the comedy store went ucb and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't pay anybody anything.</v>

425
00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:23.341
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's interesting.</v>

426
00:19:23.341 --> 00:19:26.970
<v Speaker 2>So you're saying isn't important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something.</v>

427
00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:27.923
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like especially it was important when </v>

428
00:19:29.401 --> 00:19:32.550
<v Speaker 2>the club wasn't making any money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if the club,</v>

429
00:19:32.551 --> 00:19:33.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm in the old days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

430
00:19:33.491 --> 00:19:34.440
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>

431
00:19:34.441 --> 00:19:35.760
<v Speaker 2>you got that 25 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

432
00:19:35.761 --> 00:19:38.760
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've given 25 bucks to 15 people.</v>

433
00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:41.150
<v Speaker 2>Fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much money are they really making?</v>

434
00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:44.760
<v Speaker 2>I get what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're saying has that vibe of like a,</v>

435
00:19:44.761 --> 00:19:45.594
<v Speaker 2>it's a workshop and then you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys are making money off of their </v>

436
00:19:47.851 --> 00:19:49.140
<v Speaker 2>opening up new places,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

437
00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:50.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is a business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

438
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm not telling them what to do or </v>
<v Speaker 2>telling anybody your performance or what</v>

439
00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:54.750
<v Speaker 2>do I performed there before?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

440
00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:57.540
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of weird.</v>

441
00:19:57.541 --> 00:19:58.374
<v Speaker 2>It's like these festivals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got invited to one of those festivals </v>

442
00:20:00.061 --> 00:20:04.260
<v Speaker 2>once they offered to give me a pass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a gold pass where I could watch all</v>

443
00:20:04.261 --> 00:20:05.094
<v Speaker 2>the other acts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they were going to pay me </v>

444
00:20:05.971 --> 00:20:07.440
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They weren't going to fly me.</v>

445
00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:09.810
<v Speaker 2>They weren't gonna put up right in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hotel.</v>

446
00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:11.520
<v Speaker 2>They weren't going to give me any money.</v>

447
00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:13.750
<v Speaker 3>It reminds me of that thing and Steve </v>
<v Speaker 3>Martin's book where he's,</v>

448
00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:16.810
<v Speaker 3>where he made that choice and again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a very different time,</v>

449
00:20:16.811 --> 00:20:20.290
<v Speaker 3>very different scene where he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm only headlining for money.</v>

450
00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:22.900
<v Speaker 3>But he made that conscious choice that </v>
<v Speaker 3>would not work now.</v>

451
00:20:22.901 --> 00:20:24.340
<v Speaker 3>And like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

452
00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:25.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I work out in town,</v>

453
00:20:25.511 --> 00:20:27.430
<v Speaker 3>I don't expect to get paid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it does,</v>

454
00:20:27.431 --> 00:20:29.380
<v Speaker 3>it makes a difference that the comedy </v>
<v Speaker 3>store,</v>

455
00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:31.083
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that system that is in place really </v>

456
00:20:33.581 --> 00:20:34.391
<v Speaker 3>works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

457
00:20:34.391 --> 00:20:36.790
<v Speaker 3>it's like I'm a paid regular.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was a big deal.</v>

458
00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:38.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause I remember I had been on,</v>

459
00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:43.560
<v Speaker 3>on the road doing comedy really for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>first time in the club proper,</v>

460
00:20:44.051 --> 00:20:46.150
<v Speaker 3>even though I had tons of stage time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

461
00:20:46.151 --> 00:20:46.984
<v Speaker 3>back connecting back to that all seen </v>
<v Speaker 3>where it would be a different thing </v>

462
00:20:49.391 --> 00:20:50.224
<v Speaker 3>every time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I did not quite know what I was </v>

463
00:20:51.641 --> 00:20:52.480
<v Speaker 3>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

464
00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:53.613
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the past four years was when I did </v>

465
00:20:55.331 --> 00:20:57.460
<v Speaker 3>the six shows per weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you're like,</v>

466
00:20:57.490 --> 00:20:59.230
<v Speaker 3>I'm your entertainment for the night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

467
00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:00.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>learn how to do that.</v>

468
00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:02.740
<v Speaker 3>Like people came out to see you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

469
00:21:02.741 --> 00:21:05.770
<v Speaker 3>And like you don't mumble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tell them what you're talking about.</v>

470
00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:07.350
<v Speaker 3>Repeat your theme,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

471
00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:09.220
<v Speaker 3>smile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>talk to people.</v>

472
00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:09.760
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

473
00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:11.860
<v Speaker 3>I learned how to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

474
00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:14.060
<v Speaker 3>what was my point?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

475
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:15.790
<v Speaker 3>in any way confined by that</v>

476
00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:22.260
<v Speaker 2>because you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your beginnings were so sort of free and</v>

477
00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:24.163
<v Speaker 3>I think it's like a reverse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The confinement of that is serving me </v>

478
00:21:28.971 --> 00:21:32.660
<v Speaker 3>because I needed to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It took me,</v>

479
00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:35.120
<v Speaker 3>I went about it like completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>opposite.</v>

480
00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:39.530
<v Speaker 3>I was so organic that now I'm finally </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting some structure.</v>

481
00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:41.810
<v Speaker 3>I'm Mike for the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

482
00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:42.950
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a joke.</v>

483
00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:44.600
<v Speaker 3>I read a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I honestly,</v>

484
00:21:44.601 --> 00:21:45.980
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

485
00:21:45.981 --> 00:21:49.670
<v Speaker 3>I had no idea why people were laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew I liked it,</v>

486
00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:52.130
<v Speaker 3>but I wasn't exactly sure where it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to come.</v>

487
00:21:52.131 --> 00:21:55.850
<v Speaker 3>And I knew that I had a deep connection </v>
<v Speaker 3>to it.</v>

488
00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:58.460
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what propelled me to do it.</v>

489
00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:00.890
<v Speaker 3>I had a need to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do it.</v>

490
00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:03.830
<v Speaker 3>It was the only thing and it kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>saved me.</v>

491
00:22:03.831 --> 00:22:04.664
<v Speaker 3>I needed to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean not to get all overly dramatic </v>

492
00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:10.430
<v Speaker 3>comedy kind of saved you performing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

493
00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:12.620
<v Speaker 3>Cause I just was really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

494
00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:16.940
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't know how to express myself.</v>

495
00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:21.140
<v Speaker 3>And it's still to this day is like in </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever kind of deepening thing,</v>

496
00:22:21.141 --> 00:22:23.000
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

497
00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:24.500
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a very weird discipline,</v>

498
00:22:24.501 --> 00:22:25.490
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

499
00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:27.690
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

500
00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:30.810
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird thing to get involved with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

501
00:22:30.811 --> 00:22:33.610
<v Speaker 2>chase down these ideas and try to figure</v>
<v Speaker 2>out how to flesh them out.</v>

502
00:22:33.611 --> 00:22:33.890
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

503
00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:36.500
<v Speaker 3>do you structure that you feel like you </v>
<v Speaker 3>were always,</v>

504
00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:37.453
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause I see you as somebody who's like </v>

505
00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:41.633
<v Speaker 3>so powerful and such,</v>
<v Speaker 3>such a strong point of view in both </v>

506
00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:44.723
<v Speaker 3>strong belief system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you feel like you've always kind of </v>

507
00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:47.723
<v Speaker 3>been that way?</v>

508
00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:49.750
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

509
00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:53.740
<v Speaker 2>I think comedy for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes you chase down those ideas.</v>

510
00:22:53.741 --> 00:22:55.810
<v Speaker 2>Like what is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is your real feelings on things?</v>

511
00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:56.723
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you're thinking about things so </v>

512
00:22:57.551 --> 00:22:58.384
<v Speaker 2>often and then as you're saying things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think about people's reaction to </v>

513
00:23:00.941 --> 00:23:02.080
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a big one.</v>

514
00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:03.123
<v Speaker 2>A big one is the comedy has allowed me </v>
<v Speaker 2>to really pay attention to other </v>

515
00:23:06.971 --> 00:23:11.971
<v Speaker 2>people's reactions more than like I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think our wanted to because I think if I</v>

516
00:23:12.731 --> 00:23:16.210
<v Speaker 2>had my own way and I had nothing to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>with stand up,</v>

517
00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:17.073
<v Speaker 2>I probably would be way more antisocial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way more guarded and protected and way </v>

518
00:23:22.751 --> 00:23:25.720
<v Speaker 2>more insecure because I hadn't answered </v>
<v Speaker 2>those questions.</v>

519
00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:28.600
<v Speaker 2>I didn't pose them up myself cause it </v>
<v Speaker 2>made me uncomfortable.</v>

520
00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:31.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what standup allowed me to do,</v>

521
00:23:31.421 --> 00:23:34.390
<v Speaker 2>it's like I wasn't the most outgoing </v>
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

522
00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:35.230
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

523
00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:37.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was very insecure and uh,</v>

524
00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:39.100
<v Speaker 2>even so I would get like social anxiety.</v>

525
00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:39.963
<v Speaker 2>I've talked about this before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would like talking to a bank </v>

526
00:23:41.801 --> 00:23:42.750
<v Speaker 2>teller.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be no,</v>

527
00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:46.210
<v Speaker 2>I'd know that I'm next to talk to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bank tower and I'd kind of freak out and</v>

528
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:47.210
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't know how to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

529
00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:50.780
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't exactly know how to talk and </v>
<v Speaker 2>say things and do it right.</v>

530
00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:53.720
<v Speaker 2>But it changed from teaching martial </v>
<v Speaker 2>arts.</v>

531
00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:54.863
<v Speaker 2>I want to start teaching martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I learned how to project in front of </v>

532
00:23:58.520 --> 00:23:59.353
<v Speaker 2>this big room full of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something I never imagined I was </v>

533
00:24:01.851 --> 00:24:05.480
<v Speaker 2>going to do any public speaking before </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it was never on the menu.</v>

534
00:24:05.481 --> 00:24:08.740
<v Speaker 2>I never even thought about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when I taught classes I had to teach</v>

535
00:24:08.741 --> 00:24:11.090
<v Speaker 2>them and I was teaching like in </v>
<v Speaker 2>universities,</v>

536
00:24:11.091 --> 00:24:13.610
<v Speaker 2>I've taught at bu and I taught at some </v>
<v Speaker 2>other places,</v>

537
00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:16.610
<v Speaker 2>some other gyms and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

538
00:24:16.611 --> 00:24:18.200
<v Speaker 2>you have to get these people's </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention.</v>

539
00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:20.420
<v Speaker 2>You have to be clear and you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have confidence and,</v>

540
00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:23.660
<v Speaker 2>but I knew what I was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Martial arts ask you that.</v>

541
00:24:23.661 --> 00:24:25.730
<v Speaker 2>It probably helped a lot for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you were nervous,</v>

542
00:24:25.731 --> 00:24:27.890
<v Speaker 2>you were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let the skill kind of takeover.</v>

543
00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:29.233
<v Speaker 2>We would oftentimes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we opened up a new school somewhere </v>

544
00:24:30.741 --> 00:24:34.670
<v Speaker 2>where we'd do a demonstration and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>we did give a speech afterwards,</v>

545
00:24:34.671 --> 00:24:37.610
<v Speaker 2>explain what the martial arts were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we'd do a demonstration for us.</v>

546
00:24:37.611 --> 00:24:38.444
<v Speaker 2>Like people would hold like boards and </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit and he'd kick him and stuff like </v>

547
00:24:41.091 --> 00:24:42.500
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we never did in real life.</v>

548
00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:45.140
<v Speaker 2>We only did for demonstrations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we never trained that way.</v>

549
00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:47.960
<v Speaker 2>But my point was like getting into stand</v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

550
00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:50.780
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have a particularly clean point</v>
<v Speaker 2>of view.</v>

551
00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:53.160
<v Speaker 2>I think I was 21 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

552
00:24:53.161 --> 00:24:54.670
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a moron.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

553
00:24:54.671 --> 00:24:59.450
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have any life experience other </v>
<v Speaker 2>than martial arts and girls.</v>

554
00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:01.760
<v Speaker 2>Like that was all I could talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I didn't,</v>

555
00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:03.680
<v Speaker 2>I knew martial arts weren't really </v>
<v Speaker 2>funny,</v>

556
00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:07.790
<v Speaker 2>so it was just relationship stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

557
00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:09.920
<v Speaker 2>hey guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how about when we hit that block?</v>

558
00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:11.680
<v Speaker 2>We don't really do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm all right.</v>

559
00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:15.530
<v Speaker 2>I was kicking those blocks of wood guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seriously.</v>

560
00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:17.271
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

561
00:25:17.271 --> 00:25:22.271
<v Speaker 2>I had a similar thing of it.</v>

562
00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:24.920
<v Speaker 1>It helps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

563
00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:27.410
<v Speaker 1>To just even say anything and to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

564
00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:28.520
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I exist.</v>

565
00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:31.850
<v Speaker 1>I have a voice and I'm just now starting</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

566
00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:35.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've a lot of material that's true,</v>

567
00:25:35.271 --> 00:25:38.900
<v Speaker 1>but I'm just now kind of starting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>build that deeper,</v>

568
00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:42.110
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the belief system thing.</v>

569
00:25:42.111 --> 00:25:42.944
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I talk about my personal life and </v>

570
00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:46.460
<v Speaker 1>there are kernels of things in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

571
00:25:46.461 --> 00:25:49.100
<v Speaker 1>it's scary to kind of come out.</v>

572
00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:50.353
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's fun because that's what people </v>

573
00:25:52.731 --> 00:25:53.451
<v Speaker 2>want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

574
00:25:53.451 --> 00:25:54.284
<v Speaker 2>That's what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

575
00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:57.440
<v Speaker 2>that's what gets it going and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>what gets everybody excited.</v>

576
00:25:57.441 --> 00:25:58.410
<v Speaker 2>And that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

577
00:25:59.030 --> 00:25:59.990
<v Speaker 2>that's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

578
00:25:59.991 --> 00:26:03.710
<v Speaker 2>You know what comedy is Tommy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>One really important thing as a person,</v>

579
00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:06.650
<v Speaker 2>you're not done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's no,</v>

580
00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:08.480
<v Speaker 2>there's no like you're a finished </v>
<v Speaker 2>product.</v>

581
00:26:08.481 --> 00:26:09.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did it.</v>

582
00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:10.350
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your change,</v>

583
00:26:10.351 --> 00:26:11.184
<v Speaker 2>depending upon your attitude about how </v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at your very existence right </v>

584
00:26:13.911 --> 00:26:16.670
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get you in shift within an hour.</v>

585
00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:18.650
<v Speaker 2>It could shift back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could,</v>

586
00:26:18.651 --> 00:26:21.620
<v Speaker 2>it could shift in a day or two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you take a few weeks off of</v>

587
00:26:21.621 --> 00:26:22.820
<v Speaker 2>standing up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can I ask you that?</v>

588
00:26:22.821 --> 00:26:24.560
<v Speaker 2>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it hard for you to get back?</v>

589
00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:27.140
<v Speaker 2>Chat always feels weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't done it very often,</v>

590
00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:28.303
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did it a couple of times in my career </v>

591
00:26:30.411 --> 00:26:31.244
<v Speaker 2>where I got like surgery or something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that and I had to take some time </v>

592
00:26:33.381 --> 00:26:34.214
<v Speaker 2>off and then I got burnt out once,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe like five years ago and I took </v>

593
00:26:37.851 --> 00:26:38.900
<v Speaker 2>three months off.</v>

594
00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:40.340
<v Speaker 2>And also that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was crazy.</v>

595
00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:44.430
<v Speaker 2>That was real weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then when I got back into it,</v>

596
00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:47.070
<v Speaker 2>it was before I came back to the store </v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

597
00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:50.280
<v Speaker 2>So it was a real issue with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like going on stage,</v>

598
00:26:50.281 --> 00:26:53.610
<v Speaker 2>like the Improv never felt like home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like a place to fuck around.</v>

599
00:26:53.611 --> 00:26:55.050
<v Speaker 2>It's a nice club,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it never,</v>

600
00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:58.340
<v Speaker 2>I didn't hang out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just felt weird.</v>

601
00:26:58.740 --> 00:26:59.573
<v Speaker 2>Didn't feel the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'd just do a set there and then I'd </v>

602
00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:01.463
<v Speaker 2>get out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was missing like the camaraderie </v>

603
00:27:03.031 --> 00:27:03.864
<v Speaker 2>aspect of it and I had just finished a </v>
<v Speaker 2>special and I just didn't want to do </v>

604
00:27:07.171 --> 00:27:08.004
<v Speaker 2>anything for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to chill and so I took like </v>

605
00:27:09.511 --> 00:27:10.344
<v Speaker 2>three months off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then when I came back I came back </v>

606
00:27:12.811 --> 00:27:16.800
<v Speaker 2>with like a lot of purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a really was enthusiastic about it.</v>

607
00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:17.633
<v Speaker 2>I had been thinking about coming back </v>
<v Speaker 2>for like a couple of weeks before I </v>

608
00:27:19.111 --> 00:27:21.930
<v Speaker 2>actually did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

609
00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:26.190
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're always working at it like always,</v>

610
00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:27.330
<v Speaker 2>it's always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're always,</v>

611
00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:28.730
<v Speaker 2>you're always in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

612
00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:33.770
<v Speaker 2>in the process of like reaffirming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking things through,</v>

613
00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:37.560
<v Speaker 2>understanding who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It varies with your health,</v>

614
00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:41.580
<v Speaker 2>varies with how you're eating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It varies with who's in your life.</v>

615
00:27:41.581 --> 00:27:42.414
<v Speaker 2>Like your comedy radically varies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how you interface with an audience </v>

616
00:27:45.751 --> 00:27:47.100
<v Speaker 2>radically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How you look at yourself.</v>

617
00:27:47.101 --> 00:27:49.590
<v Speaker 2>All that vary so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's never done.</v>

618
00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:51.950
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever been on stage and just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

619
00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:56.520
<v Speaker 2>been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not angry but like not enjoying,</v>

620
00:27:56.770 --> 00:28:00.360
<v Speaker 2>kind of not wanting to be on stage and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it shows in your performance there.</v>

621
00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:05.540
<v Speaker 2>Do you always get out of it through </v>
<v Speaker 2>performing then you can get upset.</v>

622
00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:07.133
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a woman who kept heckling me </v>

623
00:28:08.761 --> 00:28:09.594
<v Speaker 2>in the front row of the comedy store </v>
<v Speaker 2>just interrupting to stopping bits </v>

624
00:28:12.721 --> 00:28:14.400
<v Speaker 2>before I had a chance to explain them.</v>

625
00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:17.970
<v Speaker 2>And then finally I had to kick her out </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was so annoying.</v>

626
00:28:17.971 --> 00:28:20.580
<v Speaker 2>The way she did it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was so entitled,</v>

627
00:28:20.581 --> 00:28:23.580
<v Speaker 2>like she was entitled to voice out her </v>
<v Speaker 2>opinion in the middle.</v>

628
00:28:23.581 --> 00:28:24.414
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't what I was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This chunk last year on my last special </v>

629
00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:30.150
<v Speaker 2>about this guy who broke into the White </v>
<v Speaker 2>House,</v>

630
00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:32.550
<v Speaker 2>that a guy just broke into the White </v>
<v Speaker 2>House.</v>

631
00:28:32.551 --> 00:28:33.384
<v Speaker 2>You would think there would be all these</v>
<v Speaker 2>things in place to keep someone for </v>

632
00:28:34.711 --> 00:28:37.230
<v Speaker 2>breaking the White House.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy just humped across the lawn,</v>

633
00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:40.310
<v Speaker 2>ran across lauren gods in the front door</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there was only a girl sitting there,</v>

634
00:28:40.330 --> 00:28:41.163
<v Speaker 2>one unarmed girl by herself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He smacked her the ground and just ran </v>

635
00:28:44.581 --> 00:28:45.414
<v Speaker 2>to the fucking White House.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I had this whole bit about who's </v>

636
00:28:48.121 --> 00:28:51.600
<v Speaker 2>idea it was to have this leave a girl by</v>
<v Speaker 2>herself.</v>

637
00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:52.720
<v Speaker 2>I've seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

638
00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:56.550
<v Speaker 2>And then then I said that this is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>part,</v>

639
00:28:56.551 --> 00:28:57.870
<v Speaker 2>like this lady interrupted me.</v>

640
00:28:58.340 --> 00:28:59.580
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

641
00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:02.260
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people think that women can do </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything men can do.</v>

642
00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:03.510
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I go,</v>

643
00:29:03.511 --> 00:29:07.640
<v Speaker 2>well that doesn't make sense because men</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't even do everything men can do.</v>

644
00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:11.220
<v Speaker 2>So I was in the middle of saying that </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't even make sense because,</v>

645
00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:13.050
<v Speaker 2>and the joke is an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Explain it.</v>

646
00:29:13.051 --> 00:29:14.820
<v Speaker 2>Do I go I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the joke is lady,</v>

647
00:29:15.150 --> 00:29:15.983
<v Speaker 2>I've met Shaquille o'neal and his Dick </v>
<v Speaker 2>is where my face is and if the White </v>

648
00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:23.820
<v Speaker 2>House has experienced in a shack attack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the wrong dude to save the world.</v>

649
00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:26.700
<v Speaker 2>He's going to run me over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

650
00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:27.713
<v Speaker 2>and that I tried to explain that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>like she just wanted to interrupt </v>

651
00:29:30.961 --> 00:29:32.670
<v Speaker 2>anything that had to do with men or </v>
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>

652
00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:35.550
<v Speaker 2>So that was annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I did not have a good set that night</v>

653
00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:39.690
<v Speaker 2>cause it was like Jesus Christ crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get the fuck out of here and had a kid.</v>

654
00:29:39.691 --> 00:29:40.524
<v Speaker 2>And she had apparently had done that to </v>
<v Speaker 2>some guys that were on before and she </v>

655
00:29:43.031 --> 00:29:45.460
<v Speaker 2>was so drunk when I was looking at it in</v>
<v Speaker 2>their eyes,</v>

656
00:29:45.461 --> 00:29:46.294
<v Speaker 2>weren't focusing just just some smart </v>
<v Speaker 2>lady that was drunk that thought she </v>

657
00:29:50.651 --> 00:29:54.490
<v Speaker 2>could stop what she thought was sexism </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably because she was drunk.</v>

658
00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:59.670
<v Speaker 2>But there's a difference between like </v>
<v Speaker 2>you then overcoming it and being like,</v>

659
00:30:00.671 --> 00:30:01.930
<v Speaker 2>ha ha,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was awesome.</v>

660
00:30:01.931 --> 00:30:03.940
<v Speaker 2>And then the feeling of I think what </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

661
00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:05.160
<v Speaker 2>I was tense.</v>

662
00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:05.993
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that where you're just inside your </v>

663
00:30:07.861 --> 00:30:09.770
<v Speaker 3>own head going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to be here like</v>

664
00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:10.663
<v Speaker 2>that sacked like it's not fun that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was just like I shouldn't have allowed </v>

665
00:30:13.311 --> 00:30:14.960
<v Speaker 2>myself to get so upset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>

666
00:30:14.961 --> 00:30:15.794
<v Speaker 2>I came into the stage upset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was part of the problem is that I </v>

667
00:30:19.371 --> 00:30:20.204
<v Speaker 2>had a crazy day with a lot of fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 2>things happened and I carry that energy </v>

668
00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:25.393
<v Speaker 2>onto the stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a lot of weird shit that </v>

669
00:30:27.291 --> 00:30:29.690
<v Speaker 2>happened in my life that day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just like enough,</v>

670
00:30:29.691 --> 00:30:32.390
<v Speaker 2>enough fucking enough and then her own,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

671
00:30:32.391 --> 00:30:35.900
<v Speaker 2>it was like weird shit with friends and </v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple of weird business things.</v>

672
00:30:35.901 --> 00:30:39.590
<v Speaker 2>It was like a compounding day and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>this lady was hammered and just,</v>

673
00:30:39.591 --> 00:30:39.991
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

674
00:30:39.991 --> 00:30:40.824
<v Speaker 2>I gave her the bed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried to talk her into just release </v>

675
00:30:43.701 --> 00:30:44.534
<v Speaker 2>and explained there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is how the bit would have gone if </v>

676
00:30:45.951 --> 00:30:47.270
<v Speaker 2>you didn't know rob.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

677
00:30:47.271 --> 00:30:47.991
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get it.</v>

678
00:30:47.991 --> 00:30:49.310
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna say something outrageous.</v>

679
00:30:49.550 --> 00:30:51.620
<v Speaker 2>Then I'm going to say something more </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucked up about myself.</v>

680
00:30:51.621 --> 00:30:52.454
<v Speaker 2>This is what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I did it again and she interrupted </v>

681
00:30:53.991 --> 00:30:54.471
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

682
00:30:54.471 --> 00:30:55.940
<v Speaker 2>get the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just get out.</v>

683
00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.170
<v Speaker 2>Just get out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was,</v>

684
00:30:57.171 --> 00:31:00.650
<v Speaker 2>but it was really upset and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't really get upset.</v>

685
00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:02.720
<v Speaker 2>So when you allowed yourself get really </v>
<v Speaker 2>upset,</v>

686
00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:06.650
<v Speaker 2>it's usually because you came into it </v>
<v Speaker 2>unbalanced.</v>

687
00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:07.680
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

688
00:31:07.790 --> 00:31:10.040
<v Speaker 2>It's always you're death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're never done.</v>

689
00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:11.180
<v Speaker 2>Like you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

690
00:31:11.181 --> 00:31:14.060
<v Speaker 2>I understand how to behave now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got my shit together.</v>

691
00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:15.500
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you don't,</v>

692
00:31:15.530 --> 00:31:17.030
<v Speaker 2>you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get it right now.</v>

693
00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:19.760
<v Speaker 2>But if you let it slip,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you won't get it tomorrow.</v>

694
00:31:19.790 --> 00:31:20.623
<v Speaker 2>If you have the wrong attitude or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong approach and the wrong dude cuts </v>

<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

698
00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:30.910
<v Speaker 2>And yeah,</v>

699
00:31:30.910 --> 00:31:32.470
<v Speaker 3>going back to what we were talking about</v>
<v Speaker 3>earlier,</v>

700
00:31:32.471 --> 00:31:35.200
<v Speaker 3>that when you said you're not awkward,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I you two things,</v>

701
00:31:35.670 --> 00:31:36.503
<v Speaker 3>you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're much more of a teddy bear now </v>

702
00:31:38.861 --> 00:31:40.330
<v Speaker 3>than you used to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't you think?</v>

703
00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:43.490
<v Speaker 2>I've never thought of myself as a teddy </v>
<v Speaker 2>bear,</v>

704
00:31:43.491 --> 00:31:44.280
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

705
00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:45.000
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I see,</v>

706
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.340
<v Speaker 3>and now you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just not,</v>

707
00:31:47.370 --> 00:31:48.203
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying you weren't like this </v>

708
00:31:49.021 --> 00:31:49.854
<v Speaker 3>before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you just are so like positive and </v>

709
00:31:51.661 --> 00:31:54.120
<v Speaker 3>loving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>loving and kind of like,</v>

710
00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:56.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can feel it and whereas,</v>

711
00:31:57.770 --> 00:31:59.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of baggage in the past and</v>

712
00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:01.290
<v Speaker 3>we never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not baggage,</v>

713
00:32:01.291 --> 00:32:02.160
<v Speaker 3>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

714
00:32:02.161 --> 00:32:02.994
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy hates women or that guy hates </v>

715
00:32:04.621 --> 00:32:05.454
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that was also when Duncan was </v>

716
00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:09.400
<v Speaker 3>hanging out with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

717
00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:10.500
<v Speaker 3>he and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just broke up.</v>

718
00:32:10.501 --> 00:32:12.460
<v Speaker 3>So that was the baggage I was referring </v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

719
00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:13.110
<v Speaker 3>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

720
00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:14.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just thought,</v>

721
00:32:14.371 --> 00:32:16.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have such a strong energy that I was</v>

722
00:32:16.411 --> 00:32:18.210
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh that guy and I,</v>

723
00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:19.103
<v Speaker 3>not that I,</v>

724
00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:23.220
<v Speaker 2>it's weird because I wasn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just was,</v>

725
00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:28.250
<v Speaker 2>I just never pictured us talking easily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

726
00:32:28.390 --> 00:32:31.380
<v Speaker 2>Not saying that it wouldn't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened then it cause it just didn't,</v>

727
00:32:31.381 --> 00:32:32.350
<v Speaker 2>but I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

728
00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:34.470
<v Speaker 2>what's up with that dude?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

729
00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:37.620
<v Speaker 2>I've said odd onstage a bunch of times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

730
00:32:37.621 --> 00:32:39.980
<v Speaker 2>I look like a sexist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I look like</v>

731
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:41.660
<v Speaker 1>that I would be a dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

732
00:32:41.661 --> 00:32:43.280
<v Speaker 1>that's what I look like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

733
00:32:43.281 --> 00:32:44.114
<v Speaker 1>there's like not much you can do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you lift weights and you have a </v>

734
00:32:45.741 --> 00:32:47.240
<v Speaker 1>fat head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

735
00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:50.660
<v Speaker 1>you look like a dickhead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just right.</v>

736
00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:55.690
<v Speaker 1>There's no way around it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like kind of watching some of your</v>

737
00:32:55.701 --> 00:32:58.880
<v Speaker 1>recent podcasts where it was like one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shirts,</v>

738
00:32:58.881 --> 00:33:03.881
<v Speaker 1>the feminine for the future is feminine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Feminine.</v>

739
00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:05.713
<v Speaker 1>I want to where I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the future is masculine and you </v>

740
00:33:07.991 --> 00:33:08.824
<v Speaker 1>where the future is feminine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we just walk around or </v>

741
00:33:13.131 --> 00:33:15.730
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And opposite.</v>

742
00:33:16.390 --> 00:33:21.390
<v Speaker 1>Like if I built my compound it'd be like</v>
<v Speaker 1>crystals and lavender and soft.</v>

743
00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:23.960
<v Speaker 1>You know what the problem with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>statement,</v>

744
00:33:23.961 --> 00:33:26.960
<v Speaker 1>the future is feminist is the problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>with every single statement.</v>

745
00:33:27.050 --> 00:33:30.500
<v Speaker 1>You cannot boil down the future of one </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking sentence.</v>

746
00:33:30.890 --> 00:33:32.990
<v Speaker 1>You just can't be funny.</v>

747
00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:35.090
<v Speaker 1>Preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be fine.</v>

748
00:33:35.091 --> 00:33:38.600
<v Speaker 1>I would like to just where the future is</v>
<v Speaker 1>masculine and just not acknowledge it.</v>

749
00:33:38.670 --> 00:33:39.720
<v Speaker 1>What's up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

750
00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:43.040
<v Speaker 1>The future's masculine guys get used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

751
00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:47.070
<v Speaker 1>I should roll pack of cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what are your sleeves like?</v>

752
00:33:47.090 --> 00:33:51.350
<v Speaker 1>The fonz fuck you man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that masculine?</v>

753
00:33:52.090 --> 00:33:53.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No it makes no sense.</v>

754
00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:54.433
<v Speaker 1>No silly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh and then the other thing that when I </v>

755
00:33:56.091 --> 00:33:58.070

<v Speaker 1>to the store,</v>

757
00:34:01.910 --> 00:34:05.270
<v Speaker 1>cause I was there in the 90s to when it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was just like a terrible place and a bad</v>

<v Speaker 1>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a great assessment cause he goes,</v>

777
00:34:53.811 --> 00:34:56.120
<v Speaker 1>you've gotten really good because I had </v>
<v Speaker 1>met on the road,</v>

778
00:34:56.121 --> 00:34:56.954
<v Speaker 1>but he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a really hard room because these </v>

779
00:34:58.851 --> 00:35:00.230
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially that late show,</v>

780
00:35:00.231 --> 00:35:03.940
<v Speaker 1>like they've just had dinner and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>there and it's so dark and it's,</v>

781
00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:05.810
<v Speaker 1>it's like a room.</v>

782
00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:06.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people love it,</v>

783
00:35:06.981 --> 00:35:10.880
<v Speaker 1>but it's a room that's sort of seen its </v>
<v Speaker 1>heyday at a different time that it would</v>

784
00:35:10.881 --> 00:35:12.650
<v Speaker 1>be packed out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

785
00:35:12.651 --> 00:35:17.060
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you like it if you pack it out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there to see you.</v>

786
00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:18.073
<v Speaker 1>I do like that room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a different room than it used </v>

787
00:35:20.391 --> 00:35:22.040
<v Speaker 1>to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do I used to the old cobb's?</v>

788
00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:24.680
<v Speaker 1>That's where I met 'em man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

789
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:27.140
<v Speaker 1>That's where I met Alma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll juggle all magical.</v>

790
00:35:27.141 --> 00:35:31.070
<v Speaker 1>Started working together and like 1919 </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking eight or some shit.</v>

791
00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:32.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a long time ago,</v>

792
00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:35.630
<v Speaker 1>but I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the old one was tiny,</v>

793
00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:37.770
<v Speaker 1>like just a little bit bigger than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>belly room.</v>

794
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:38.843
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was like like a hundred seats </v>
<v Speaker 2>or something like that was really </v>

795
00:35:41.191 --> 00:35:44.310
<v Speaker 2>ridiculously small.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I might be off by a little,</v>

796
00:35:44.311 --> 00:35:45.144
<v Speaker 2>it might be like 130 but they would </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff everybody in there to get 130 and </v>

797
00:35:48.421 --> 00:35:51.090
<v Speaker 2>it was this tiny little club and I used </v>
<v Speaker 2>to work at,</v>

798
00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:52.190
<v Speaker 2>even though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

799
00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:53.093
<v Speaker 2>it would actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could make less money there then I </v>

800
00:35:55.051 --> 00:35:57.720
<v Speaker 2>could at at the punchline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked it better.</v>

801
00:35:57.990 --> 00:35:59.280
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this place is better.</v>

802
00:35:59.430 --> 00:36:00.840
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's grimy,</v>

803
00:36:00.841 --> 00:36:02.770
<v Speaker 2>it's tiny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then Tom saw,</v>

804
00:36:02.771 --> 00:36:05.520
<v Speaker 2>or the guy who ran it was like a s a </v>
<v Speaker 2>huge comedy nerd,</v>

805
00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:07.500
<v Speaker 2>like a dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really love comedy.</v>

806
00:36:07.501 --> 00:36:09.210
<v Speaker 2>And so I liked that and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>

807
00:36:09.211 --> 00:36:10.890
<v Speaker 2>he's supporting good comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck it.</v>

808
00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:14.220
<v Speaker 2>So I started going there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then when they turned it into the new</v>

809
00:36:14.221 --> 00:36:14.820
<v Speaker 2>place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

810
00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:17.100
<v Speaker 2>this is the opposite of what you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

811
00:36:17.370 --> 00:36:21.450
<v Speaker 2>You guys were the most intimate club and</v>
<v Speaker 2>now you're the cavernous.</v>

812
00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:22.800
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause it,</v>

813
00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:24.850
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clubs have to be like,</v>

814
00:36:25.210 --> 00:36:26.830
<v Speaker 2>there's got to be right on top of you.</v>

815
00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:28.693
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I came back from going on the road for </v>

816
00:36:31.671 --> 00:36:35.990
<v Speaker 3>the first time and doing the six shows </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was on 24,</v>

817
00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:36.853
<v Speaker 3>which I love the word just full on </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy shop talking by the way that we </v>

818
00:36:41.751 --> 00:36:43.670
<v Speaker 3>do that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do that a long time.</v>

819
00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:46.330
<v Speaker 3>Does it feel unusual?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

820
00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:47.151
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

821
00:36:47.151 --> 00:36:48.440
<v Speaker 3>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like it.</v>

822
00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:51.560
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just got a little self conscious for a</v>

823
00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:53.810
<v Speaker 3>minute anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The rooms and the ceiling.</v>

824
00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:55.070
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Funny thing.</v>

825
00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:56.333
<v Speaker 2>I think people enjoy it too because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like hearing people who were </v>

826
00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:01.710
<v Speaker 2>professionals talk about what makes it </v>
<v Speaker 2>good and what makes it bad.</v>

827
00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:03.450
<v Speaker 2>Then when they're there themselves like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

828
00:37:03.451 --> 00:37:05.580
<v Speaker 2>the room's Kinda high on this place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

829
00:37:05.581 --> 00:37:06.600
<v Speaker 2>this place is intimate.</v>

830
00:37:07.090 --> 00:37:08.260
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was on,</v>

831
00:37:08.350 --> 00:37:09.183
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you gave me the confidence to get back </v>

832
00:37:10.271 --> 00:37:11.104
<v Speaker 3>in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was on 24 when it came back and we </v>

833
00:37:13.781 --> 00:37:17.410
<v Speaker 3>filmed in London because it had been </v>
<v Speaker 3>done for like two years and they brought</v>

834
00:37:17.411 --> 00:37:18.244
<v Speaker 3>it back and it was the end of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>airing and it was the first time I was </v>

835
00:37:22.301 --> 00:37:23.134
<v Speaker 3>going on the road as a comic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So because my face was on TV and people </v>

836
00:37:27.221 --> 00:37:28.054
<v Speaker 3>were super into 24,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my shows packed out the first time I'd </v>

837
00:37:31.690 --> 00:37:32.740
<v Speaker 3>ever gone on the road.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

838
00:37:32.741 --> 00:37:33.574
<v Speaker 3>My first 45 50 minute show and I first </v>
<v Speaker 3>hit the stage at like side splitters </v>

839
00:37:38.081 --> 00:37:39.280
<v Speaker 3>Tamba or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

840
00:37:39.281 --> 00:37:41.170
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>use all your shows are sold out.</v>

841
00:37:41.171 --> 00:37:43.300
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

842
00:37:43.301 --> 00:37:46.300
<v Speaker 3>my opener and my middle are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is great.</v>

843
00:37:46.301 --> 00:37:47.720
<v Speaker 3>It's sold out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then when they got on the stage,</v>

844
00:37:47.721 --> 00:37:48.430
<v Speaker 3>they come up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>

845
00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:52.660
<v Speaker 3>your audience is weird because they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>24 fans and they were all,</v>

846
00:37:52.750 --> 00:37:54.010
<v Speaker 3>they don't come out to clubs.</v>

847
00:37:54.010 --> 00:37:54.370
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

848
00:37:54.370 --> 00:37:54.740
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

849
00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:56.380
<v Speaker 3>Like I would sometimes have somebody </v>
<v Speaker 3>sitting,</v>

850
00:37:56.381 --> 00:37:57.214
<v Speaker 3>like with this guy had an article of </v>
<v Speaker 3>clothing that I had worn and season </v>

851
00:38:00.401 --> 00:38:01.870
<v Speaker 3>three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm like trying to do comedy.</v>

852
00:38:01.871 --> 00:38:02.680
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

853
00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:03.513
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you just want me to sign your </v>

854
00:38:04.991 --> 00:38:06.460
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

855
00:38:06.461 --> 00:38:09.070
<v Speaker 3>in my approach was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I'm in my own head,</v>

856
00:38:09.071 --> 00:38:10.030
<v Speaker 3>so I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hi.</v>

857
00:38:10.031 --> 00:38:14.170
<v Speaker 3>So my name's Mary Lynn and doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing my like I'm uncomfortable.</v>

858
00:38:14.171 --> 00:38:17.320
<v Speaker 3>And that's where my comedy comes around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the whole vibe was like,</v>

859
00:38:17.321 --> 00:38:18.940
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

860
00:38:18.941 --> 00:38:22.120
<v Speaker 3>like your TV star.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we came to see you and I,</v>

861
00:38:22.121 --> 00:38:27.121
<v Speaker 3>and I had to adjust and like take that </v>
<v Speaker 3>in and then not only take it in but talk</v>

862
00:38:27.641 --> 00:38:28.391
<v Speaker 3>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

863
00:38:28.391 --> 00:38:28.900
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

864
00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:29.733
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I would just be like Jack Bauer and </v>

865
00:38:30.431 --> 00:38:31.350
<v Speaker 3>they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ha ha.</v>

866
00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:33.060
<v Speaker 3>Like losing their shit and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

867
00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:36.010
<v Speaker 3>I would just make somebody in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>audience like my Jack Bauer</v>

868
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:37.090
<v Speaker 1>and then I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

869
00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:40.840
<v Speaker 1>how to make it like five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 15 minutes of like,</v>

870
00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:44.230
<v Speaker 1>let's talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it was such an amazing thing,</v>

871
00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:45.820
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was to me too,</v>

872
00:38:45.821 --> 00:38:48.520
<v Speaker 1>but I had this hope that was the only </v>
<v Speaker 1>drama I had ever been on.</v>

873
00:38:48.521 --> 00:38:52.150
<v Speaker 1>And I have this whole other world of </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy that I had been doing,</v>

874
00:38:52.151 --> 00:38:56.410
<v Speaker 1>but the intersection of that was just </v>
<v Speaker 1>like bizarre.</v>

875
00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:57.251
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then I,</v>

876
00:38:57.251 --> 00:38:58.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>

877
00:38:58.691 --> 00:39:01.380
<v Speaker 1>you're never done and you never know </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going to happen and you adjust to</v>

878
00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:02.223
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would do the 24 stuff and then I </v>

879
00:39:04.001 --> 00:39:04.834
<v Speaker 1>would go into my stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my stuff about my life and my </v>

880
00:39:08.501 --> 00:39:12.460
<v Speaker 1>personal life and my point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that became really gratifying.</v>

881
00:39:12.461 --> 00:39:16.330
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once I sort of brought them in,</v>

882
00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:19.360
<v Speaker 1>did the thing that they needed to hear </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

883
00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:21.430
<v Speaker 1>which is also part of my life.</v>

884
00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:22.293
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how long did it take before they stop </v>

885
00:39:24.281 --> 00:39:25.114
<v Speaker 1>coming to see you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you're from 24 and started </v>

886
00:39:27.281 --> 00:39:29.320
<v Speaker 1>coming to see you because you're a funny</v>
<v Speaker 1>comic.</v>

887
00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:31.900
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still waiting for that to happen.</v>

888
00:39:32.410 --> 00:39:36.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm still hoping for a career in comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

889
00:39:36.701 --> 00:39:38.290
<v Speaker 1>seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it dropped off.</v>

890
00:39:38.291 --> 00:39:39.124
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I did that same circuit a year and a </v>

891
00:39:41.050 --> 00:39:41.883
<v Speaker 1>half later and there'd be some super </v>
<v Speaker 1>fans or be some comedy fans and there'd </v>

892
00:39:44.231 --> 00:39:46.390
<v Speaker 1>be some people that didn't know why the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hell they were there.</v>

893
00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:48.820
<v Speaker 1>So then I would have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

894
00:39:48.821 --> 00:39:49.654
<v Speaker 1>the guy that knows me from always sunny </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Philadelphia at the lady that knows </v>

895
00:39:52.031 --> 00:39:55.120
<v Speaker 1>me from 24 and the guy who was out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>his mind on drugs going,</v>

896
00:39:55.121 --> 00:39:56.500
<v Speaker 1>you're not funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

897
00:39:57.700 --> 00:39:59.740
<v Speaker 1>this poor person's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's the superstar.</v>

898
00:39:59.741 --> 00:40:01.840
<v Speaker 1>Like why is she in this shit hole?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then other guys,</v>

899
00:40:01.841 --> 00:40:02.890
<v Speaker 1>like I don't know who she is.</v>

900
00:40:02.890 --> 00:40:03.723
<v Speaker 1>And then that guys like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't get what I get because she's </v>

901
00:40:05.471 --> 00:40:06.304
<v Speaker 1>from always sunny in Philadelphia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I would pit them against each </v>

902
00:40:08.651 --> 00:40:09.220
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

903
00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:10.930
<v Speaker 1>she doesn't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you get it.</v>

904
00:40:10.931 --> 00:40:13.930
<v Speaker 1>And it's like the burden of being so </v>
<v Speaker 1>versatile,</v>

905
00:40:13.931 --> 00:40:16.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>such a cross to bear.</v>

906
00:40:17.110 --> 00:40:17.943
<v Speaker 1>It must've been a fun transition though </v>
<v Speaker 1>once you got through the initial stages </v>

907
00:40:20.531 --> 00:40:23.200
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of people would have </v>
<v Speaker 1>bailed like a lot of people.</v>

908
00:40:23.201 --> 00:40:23.921
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>

909
00:40:23.921 --> 00:40:25.570
<v Speaker 1>fuck doing in the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is just too crazy.</v>

910
00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:26.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

911
00:40:26.771 --> 00:40:28.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean it sucks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I love it.</v>

912
00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:28.893
<v Speaker 1>It's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's sorta changed who you are then </v>

913
00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:35.050
<v Speaker 1>what you think of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're like a real comic now.</v>

914
00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:36.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

915
00:40:37.330 --> 00:40:38.163
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for so many years I had that little </v>

916
00:40:39.941 --> 00:40:40.521
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

917
00:40:40.521 --> 00:40:42.520
<v Speaker 1>you haven't done the road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you haven't really done it.</v>

918
00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:43.580
<v Speaker 1>And now I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

919
00:40:43.590 --> 00:40:44.020
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

920
00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:46.690
<v Speaker 1>I know how to do the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so many people that don't do the</v>

921
00:40:46.691 --> 00:40:49.030
<v Speaker 1>road that I wish would leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

922
00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:50.620
<v Speaker 1>like God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to experience it.</v>

923
00:40:50.621 --> 00:40:51.500
<v Speaker 1>You've got to go out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and,</v>

924
00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:53.470
<v Speaker 1>but they don't want to do like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Shitty road.</v>

925
00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:55.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to do the Shitty road.</v>

926
00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:58.030
<v Speaker 1>I also learned something about myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Shitty road,</v>

927
00:40:58.090 --> 00:40:59.290
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I,</v>

928
00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:03.760
<v Speaker 1>I would not have a car and I take the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hotel that they gave me that would be by</v>

929
00:41:03.761 --> 00:41:06.520
<v Speaker 1>the freeway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be not even near the city and</v>

930
00:41:06.521 --> 00:41:09.090
<v Speaker 1>a little bit from the club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I just hold up and then I,</v>

931
00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:10.660
<v Speaker 1>it took me a while to realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

932
00:41:10.661 --> 00:41:11.494
<v Speaker 1>you like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I like a certain amount of </v>

933
00:41:13.541 --> 00:41:15.720
<v Speaker 1>suffering and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>so shitty here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go like walk along the </v>

935
00:41:18.011 --> 00:41:19.480
<v Speaker 1>freeway and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

936
00:41:19.481 --> 00:41:20.460
<v Speaker 1>someone would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't you,</v>

937
00:41:20.530 --> 00:41:21.610
<v Speaker 1>why didn't you get a car?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>

938
00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:22.503
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just walked over to Chili's for lunch </v>

939
00:41:25.330 --> 00:41:26.163
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>along the grass and the side of the </v>

940
00:41:28.751 --> 00:41:31.180
<v Speaker 1>freeway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>

941
00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:34.340
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you actually like</v>

942
00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:39.370
<v Speaker 2>the dinginess of weird cities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So are we saying yeah,</v>

943
00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:40.633
<v Speaker 2>or I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The part of me likes the shittiness of </v>

944
00:41:45.681 --> 00:41:47.120
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to like,</v>

945
00:41:47.121 --> 00:41:47.954
<v Speaker 2>there was one house gask I don't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>why there was one hotel room that had </v>

946
00:41:52.281 --> 00:41:52.470
<v Speaker 2>like</v>

947
00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:56.400
<v Speaker 3>got a dining room table for 10 and like </v>
<v Speaker 3>this big,</v>

948
00:41:56.430 --> 00:41:57.263
<v Speaker 3>these big plastic flowers with dust all </v>
<v Speaker 3>over them and this weird hot plate with </v>

949
00:42:00.691 --> 00:42:05.691
<v Speaker 3>foil on it and a walk in closet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it was the shittiest most run down,</v>

950
00:42:06.031 --> 00:42:11.031
<v Speaker 3>like who's who's partying in here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like who's fancy hotel suite is this.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

952
00:42:15.210 --> 00:42:16.260
<v Speaker 2>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

953
00:42:16.261 --> 00:42:17.970
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's just fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

954
00:42:18.090 --> 00:42:21.000
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like being comfortable,</v>

955
00:42:21.001 --> 00:42:23.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like having my things,</v>

956
00:42:23.581 --> 00:42:26.540
<v Speaker 2>but I guess I like that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

957
00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:28.790
<v Speaker 2>I like feeling the pain of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

958
00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:31.080
<v Speaker 2>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just not being comfortable,</v>

959
00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:34.230
<v Speaker 2>but it also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's in contrast to your life in</v>

960
00:42:34.231 --> 00:42:35.190
<v Speaker 2>La,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

964
00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:43.640
<v Speaker 2>So then you can do it on the road all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>

965
00:42:43.750 --> 00:42:47.450
<v Speaker 2>I've seen those pictures on instagram </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you just throw it and gold.</v>

966
00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:49.850
<v Speaker 2>She's throwing it up in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh.</v>

967
00:42:50.210 --> 00:42:52.850
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but here thing is isolation tank.</v>

968
00:42:52.851 --> 00:42:53.684
<v Speaker 2>Mine is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get in one of those blowers where the </v>

969
00:42:54.651 --> 00:42:56.660
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I do in the morning.</v>

970
00:42:56.661 --> 00:42:58.790
<v Speaker 2>I just get my little room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like the money,</v>

971
00:42:58.791 --> 00:43:02.300
<v Speaker 2>it's just a cycle and have hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>around me.</v>

972
00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:05.230
<v Speaker 2>I get up money massage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

973
00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:06.073
<v Speaker 2>it's so great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you're in the road and you're </v>

974
00:43:08.601 --> 00:43:12.730
<v Speaker 2>in like a shitty hotel in Pittsburgh or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

975
00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:15.350
<v Speaker 2>it's in the middle of January.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You look out in the skies.</v>

976
00:43:15.351 --> 00:43:18.530
<v Speaker 2>I got shitty dark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>smoky gray.</v>

977
00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:21.180
<v Speaker 2>There's not even a hint of Sun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's noon.</v>

978
00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:22.740
<v Speaker 2>You look out nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

979
00:43:22.890 --> 00:43:27.020
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's got this look on their face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody just sour puss,</v>

980
00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:30.020
<v Speaker 2>just wiping dust off the window.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

981
00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:35.530
<v Speaker 3>I like that weird air conditioning or </v>
<v Speaker 3>heater that doesn't really work and just</v>

982
00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:37.600
<v Speaker 3>crank on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

983
00:43:37.730 --> 00:43:38.340
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

984
00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:40.050
<v Speaker 3>In the middle of the night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't control them.</v>

985
00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:42.120
<v Speaker 2>An asshole man.</v>

986
00:43:42.750 --> 00:43:46.250
<v Speaker 3>I once had a lady in a hotel room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

987
00:43:48.510 --> 00:43:51.840
<v Speaker 3>how did this go?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was the receptionist.</v>

988
00:43:53.010 --> 00:43:54.030
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all a blur.</v>

989
00:43:54.031 --> 00:43:56.090
<v Speaker 3>I don't even remember what city it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

990
00:43:56.940 --> 00:43:59.490
<v Speaker 3>one of those low,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mid hotels.</v>

991
00:43:59.550 --> 00:44:01.710
<v Speaker 3>She calls me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm napping.</v>

992
00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:03.450
<v Speaker 3>It's like after you do the radio or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

993
00:44:03.451 --> 00:44:04.470
<v Speaker 3>I'm napping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

994
00:44:04.471 --> 00:44:05.520
<v Speaker 3>hi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

995
00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:09.270
<v Speaker 3>there's a fan down here with a bottle of</v>
<v Speaker 3>wine for you.</v>

996
00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:12.330
<v Speaker 3>Can I send him up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Swear to God.</v>

997
00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:17.730
<v Speaker 3>I've never felt more unsafe or on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>verge of a breakdown.</v>

998
00:44:17.731 --> 00:44:18.960
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you woke me up.</v>

999
00:44:19.470 --> 00:44:20.700
<v Speaker 3>Second of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

1000
00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:21.713
<v Speaker 3>you're the gateway between,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was such a small town and it was </v>

1001
00:44:25.921 --> 00:44:28.170
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>such a foreign concept to her.</v>

1002
00:44:29.070 --> 00:44:29.910
<v Speaker 3>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1003
00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:31.950
<v Speaker 3>that's inherent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're right,</v>

1004
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:32.813
<v Speaker 3>you're the protection that I have from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>should I send him up a stranger who </v>

1005
00:44:37.981 --> 00:44:40.970
<v Speaker 3>stopped at the hotel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drugs with a bottle of wine,</v>

1006
00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:42.200
<v Speaker 3>got a bottle of drugs for you.</v>

1007
00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:46.020
<v Speaker 3>Should I send him up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seemed like a good move.</v>

1008
00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:49.520
<v Speaker 3>And then you know what I did as I </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually took his car,</v>

1009
00:44:49.521 --> 00:44:50.890
<v Speaker 3>I could hear him in the background go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1010
00:44:50.891 --> 00:44:51.180
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1011
00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:53.220
<v Speaker 3>That's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he actually was a nice guy,</v>

1012
00:44:53.890 --> 00:44:56.720
<v Speaker 3>but nice enough of a person that would </v>
<v Speaker 3>do that.</v>

1013
00:44:56.730 --> 00:44:58.780
<v Speaker 3>Wanted to bring a bottle of wine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was,</v>

1014
00:44:58.870 --> 00:45:01.890
<v Speaker 3>I think that was her idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so then I started like,</v>

1015
00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:03.960
<v Speaker 3>instead of going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck are you talking about?</v>

1016
00:45:03.961 --> 00:45:05.010
<v Speaker 3>I just went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1017
00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:08.010
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I'll come down and get it.</v>

1018
00:45:08.490 --> 00:45:09.323
<v Speaker 3>And then I came down and met him and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was so unsettling and that was </v>

1019
00:45:13.981 --> 00:45:15.510
<v Speaker 3>her idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't his idea.</v>

1020
00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:19.470
<v Speaker 3>But instead of saying don't do that and </v>
<v Speaker 3>setting her straight,</v>

1021
00:45:19.471 --> 00:45:20.304
<v Speaker 3>I took the middle road.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And how well did you go back to sleep </v>

1022
00:45:21.991 --> 00:45:23.200
<v Speaker 3>after that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not so good.</v>

1023
00:45:23.210 --> 00:45:24.043
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I drank that bottle of wine and had the </v>

1024
00:45:26.521 --> 00:45:28.530
<v Speaker 3>best show of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm over at the show.</v>

1025
00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:32.171
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's creepy.</v>

1026
00:45:32.171 --> 00:45:33.080
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1027
00:45:33.130 --> 00:45:36.010
<v Speaker 2>Ali Wong has a great bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to do it justice.</v>

1028
00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:38.200
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't want to paraphrase it either</v>

1029
00:45:38.260 --> 00:45:39.730
<v Speaker 2>and I want to tell anybody what it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

1030
00:45:39.731 --> 00:45:40.564
<v Speaker 2>but it's essentially the difference </v>
<v Speaker 2>between life for a woman comic on the </v>

1031
00:45:43.451 --> 00:45:45.420
<v Speaker 2>road versus a white,</v>
<v Speaker 2>young male comic.</v>

1032
00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:47.170
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a big difference.</v>

1033
00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:48.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The uh,</v>

1034
00:45:48.911 --> 00:45:49.744
<v Speaker 2>the danger level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's like guys that get to get </v>

1035
00:45:51.761 --> 00:45:53.640
<v Speaker 2>obsessed with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1036
00:45:53.650 --> 00:45:57.760
<v Speaker 2>I want to bring you wine shit and like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that stuff that's gotta be weird.</v>

1037
00:45:58.310 --> 00:46:01.160
<v Speaker 3>I had another guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was the guy who held the sweater.</v>

1038
00:46:01.161 --> 00:46:01.994
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's your sweater from season three but </v>

1039
00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:05.273
<v Speaker 3>you want somehow online.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He bought it and then after the show he </v>

1040
00:46:08.241 --> 00:46:09.650
<v Speaker 3>won.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He showed me,</v>

1041
00:46:10.250 --> 00:46:12.050
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what's wrong with me </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I'm like,</v>

1042
00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:15.320
<v Speaker 3>he was a really nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this is a terrible situation,</v>

1043
00:46:15.610 --> 00:46:17.750
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for whatever reason I'm like,</v>

1044
00:46:18.170 --> 00:46:21.530
<v Speaker 3>he needs me to listen to him right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I stood there like,</v>

1045
00:46:21.531 --> 00:46:22.364
<v Speaker 3>what is wrong with me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had two thick photo books of the </v>

1046
00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:28.273
<v Speaker 3>thousands of dollars of memorabilia and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the pictures of all the items and the </v>

1047
00:46:30.231 --> 00:46:35.231
<v Speaker 3>itemized of shit from the show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

1048
00:46:35.451 --> 00:46:36.284
<v Speaker 3>I'm there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking around like anybody seeing </v>

1049
00:46:38.661 --> 00:46:40.100
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just me and him.</v>

1050
00:46:40.190 --> 00:46:40.641
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1051
00:46:40.641 --> 00:46:43.130
<v Speaker 3>You guys continue cleaning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause that's the weird thing too,</v>

1052
00:46:43.140 --> 00:46:47.420
<v Speaker 3>because I'm a superstar on one end,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but on the other end it's like,</v>

1053
00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:49.250
<v Speaker 3>not really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have the money.</v>

1054
00:46:49.251 --> 00:46:51.960
<v Speaker 3>I'm not bringing anyone with me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm right.</v>

1055
00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:52.813
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like a regular headliner on the </v>

1056
00:46:55.041 --> 00:46:55.580
<v Speaker 3>braces.</v>

1057
00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:56.810
<v Speaker 2>Do have security though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1058
00:46:56.811 --> 00:46:58.160
<v Speaker 2>Most places they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1059
00:46:58.161 --> 00:46:59.150
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1060
00:46:59.180 --> 00:47:01.640
<v Speaker 2>They just probably weren't aware that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they should be paying attention.</v>

1061
00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:02.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe.</v>

1062
00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:03.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe they thought,</v>

1063
00:47:03.470 --> 00:47:04.810
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a friend of hers.</v>

1064
00:47:04.820 --> 00:47:05.740
<v Speaker 3>That's also a weird thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1065
00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:06.613
<v Speaker 2>When do you step in?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy's got a bunch of books filled </v>

1066
00:47:08.151 --> 00:47:09.140
<v Speaker 2>with memorabilia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1067
00:47:09.350 --> 00:47:11.110
<v Speaker 2>Like when that seems okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that doesn't,</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a very,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1075
00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:19.533

1076
00:47:20.711 --> 00:47:22.660
<v Speaker 3>validated him even though I wanted to </v>

<v Speaker 1>scissors.</v>

<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1091
00:47:59.230 --> 00:48:00.063
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're a comedian and you do a </v>

1092
00:48:02.021 --> 00:48:05.020
<v Speaker 1>drama show like 24,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was basically like a drama,</v>

1093
00:48:06.550 --> 00:48:08.120
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slas.</v>

<v Speaker 1>ever write super job?</v>

1095
00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:13.533
<v Speaker 1>I think I messed up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should have just rolled into another </v>

1096
00:48:15.970 --> 00:48:16.803
<v Speaker 1>drama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to open my mouth and show </v>

1097
00:48:20.471 --> 00:48:24.130
<v Speaker 1>everybody how not the computer genius I </v>
<v Speaker 1>am like,</v>

1098
00:48:24.131 --> 00:48:25.120
<v Speaker 1>what is wrong with me?</v>

1099
00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:25.953
<v Speaker 1>I'm a Wa I've set up obstacles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know her from 24 what welcome the </v>

1100
00:48:30.941 --> 00:48:31.774
<v Speaker 1>comedy stylings of what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember what Richard Belzer </v>

1101
00:48:34.091 --> 00:48:35.020
<v Speaker 1>going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Law and order.</v>

1102
00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:36.850
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1104
00:48:39.730 --> 00:48:41.710
<v Speaker 1>Like he doesn't do any common anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think,</v>

1105
00:48:42.790 --> 00:48:43.623
<v Speaker 1>I think that should clean up my act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should I only be funny now or should I </v>

1106
00:48:47.501 --> 00:48:51.610
<v Speaker 1>get another drama?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I think you should stay funny.</v>

1107
00:48:51.970 --> 00:48:53.770
<v Speaker 1>Just be the funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just do that.</v>

1109
00:48:55.961 --> 00:48:58.630

<v Speaker 1>being on the road.</v>

1110
00:48:58.631 --> 00:48:59.464
<v Speaker 1>And then coming back to the store and </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking like I got it cause I've been </v>

1111
00:49:02.771 --> 00:49:03.820

<v Speaker 1>Coming back doing the main room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't got it at all.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You can run faster.</v>

1120
00:49:35.081 --> 00:49:36.640
<v Speaker 1>The weight vest on if your legs are </v>

<v Speaker 1>or do anything.</v>

1133
00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:12.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's my nature.</v>

1134

<v Speaker 1>But you don't have a hundred percent </v>

1137
00:50:26.021 --> 00:50:27.710
<v Speaker 1>confidence and your future resolve</v>

1138
00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:29.053
<v Speaker 2>like you don't know in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think there's gonna come a time </v>

1139
00:50:34.491 --> 00:50:36.680
<v Speaker 2>where you just a week turns into a </v>
<v Speaker 2>month,</v>

1140
00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:41.900
<v Speaker 2>turns into a year and then 24 again </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes on?</v>

1141
00:50:42.050 --> 00:50:43.760
<v Speaker 2>We didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do 24 for the black guy.</v>

1142
00:50:44.180 --> 00:50:45.920
<v Speaker 2>Was there a reason?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that still okay?</v>

1143
00:50:46.210 --> 00:50:47.600
<v Speaker 2>It's still good now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's done.</v>

1144
00:50:47.670 --> 00:50:50.120
<v Speaker 2>It's done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did it with a whole new cast.</v>

1145
00:50:50.510 --> 00:50:53.960
<v Speaker 2>I think it went one season.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's what happens.</v>

1146
00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:57.110
<v Speaker 2>Fucking white people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ruined it.</v>

1147
00:50:58.490 --> 00:50:59.960
<v Speaker 2>Thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>White people,</v>

1148
00:51:00.220 --> 00:51:03.680
<v Speaker 2>white people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't promote it good enough.</v>

1149
00:51:03.710 --> 00:51:05.720
<v Speaker 2>You promoted great for Kiefer </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sutherland.</v>

1150
00:51:06.210 --> 00:51:10.400
<v Speaker 2>I didn't understand what you're getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>on with that black actor and you fucking</v>

1151
00:51:10.401 --> 00:51:13.010
<v Speaker 2>halfass and cancel it before people grew</v>
<v Speaker 2>to love it.</v>

1152
00:51:13.610 --> 00:51:17.030
<v Speaker 2>I think that was a pretty tough act to </v>
<v Speaker 2>follow.</v>

1153
00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:18.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>

1184
00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:28.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird thing to do.</v>

1185
00:52:29.090 --> 00:52:31.700
<v Speaker 2>It's weird thing to do and maybe you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have to.</v>

1186
00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:32.960
<v Speaker 2>None of us do it really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1187
00:52:32.961 --> 00:52:34.530
<v Speaker 2>there's gonna come a point in time in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>life for,</v>

1188
00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:37.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to do this anymore,</v>

1189
00:52:38.090 --> 00:52:41.780
<v Speaker 2>but for right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's cool that you,</v>

1190
00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:43.070
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1191
00:52:43.071 --> 00:52:46.070
<v Speaker 2>pretty love the live show as much as you</v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

1192
00:52:46.130 --> 00:52:48.950
<v Speaker 2>It's a struggle I would love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really enjoy struggling.</v>

1193
00:52:49.790 --> 00:52:50.623
<v Speaker 2>I do think it's very important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very important for my balance as a </v>

1194
00:52:53.451 --> 00:52:55.100
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially me,</v>

1195
00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:59.890
<v Speaker 2>I have maniacal genetics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My brain is just constantly,</v>

1196
00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:03.710
<v Speaker 2>constantly overrun with things to think </v>
<v Speaker 2>about and do.</v>

1197
00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:06.230
<v Speaker 2>My brain just wants to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just come up,</v>

1198
00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:06.860
<v Speaker 2>let's go.</v>

1199
00:53:06.860 --> 00:53:09.630
<v Speaker 2>We need more fucking stimuli shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's go.</v>

1200
00:53:09.930 --> 00:53:11.690
<v Speaker 2>There's no to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd always need something.</v>

1201
00:53:11.870 --> 00:53:14.660
<v Speaker 2>So what I do is just stuff it filled </v>
<v Speaker 2>with information,</v>

1202
00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:15.703
<v Speaker 2>work it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get it to run hills and do Jujitsu and </v>

1203
00:53:18.141 --> 00:53:21.800
<v Speaker 2>yoga and burn that motherfucker out so </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I could be calm.</v>

1204
00:53:21.801 --> 00:53:22.634
<v Speaker 2>And so what you've lot of what people </v>
<v Speaker 2>notice today versus how I was like 20 </v>

1205
00:53:26.101 --> 00:53:27.520
<v Speaker 2>years ago is this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1206
00:53:27.521 --> 00:53:30.690
<v Speaker 2>I understand myself better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm better at managing my,</v>

1207
00:53:31.170 --> 00:53:34.110
<v Speaker 2>like whatever are the things that make </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1208
00:53:34.111 --> 00:53:34.944
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm better at managing those to be very </v>

1209
00:53:37.501 --> 00:53:38.334
<v Speaker 2>positive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to just be just overall in my attitude </v>

1210
00:53:40.721 --> 00:53:43.470
<v Speaker 2>is very different to it's overall just </v>
<v Speaker 2>nicer to people.</v>

1211
00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:48.800
<v Speaker 2>And how did you become nicer?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just realize that when I'm at my best,</v>

1212
00:53:48.870 --> 00:53:49.703
<v Speaker 2>that's who I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the only variation between that and </v>

1213
00:53:52.441 --> 00:53:54.630
<v Speaker 2>when I'm at worst.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You weren't nice before?</v>

1214
00:53:54.750 --> 00:53:55.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was nice.</v>

1215
00:53:55.651 --> 00:53:59.040
<v Speaker 2>I just wasn't as Nice Sam now I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>always been nice,</v>

1216
00:53:59.490 --> 00:54:01.020
<v Speaker 2>but I've always been nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1217
00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:04.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm quicker to pull the trigger back </v>
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>

1218
00:54:04.460 --> 00:54:05.251
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1219
00:54:05.251 --> 00:54:06.480
<v Speaker 2>and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm less</v>

1220
00:54:06.740 --> 00:54:08.530
<v Speaker 3>must remember we were at the comedy </v>
<v Speaker 3>store,</v>

1221
00:54:08.531 --> 00:54:10.300
<v Speaker 3>this is pretty recently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1222
00:54:10.890 --> 00:54:13.000
<v Speaker 3>that guy came into the bathroom when I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was in there.</v>

1223
00:54:14.020 --> 00:54:19.020
<v Speaker 3>You totally pulled like the best male </v>
<v Speaker 3>like strong guy.</v>

1224
00:54:20.230 --> 00:54:22.210
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was so good.</v>

1225
00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:24.120
<v Speaker 3>Your leg.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause I,</v>

1226
00:54:25.070 --> 00:54:29.440
<v Speaker 3>I think the guy was like on coke or a </v>
<v Speaker 3>combo of something.</v>

1227
00:54:30.660 --> 00:54:31.493
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like do I not have regard for my </v>

1228
00:54:33.791 --> 00:54:37.090
<v Speaker 3>own being because a part of me kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>left my body and was like,</v>

1229
00:54:37.091 --> 00:54:39.010
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy is crazy cause he's like,</v>

1230
00:54:39.310 --> 00:54:40.143
<v Speaker 3>give me a kiss.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is like in the women's </v>

1231
00:54:41.861 --> 00:54:42.420
<v Speaker 3>bathroom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

1232
00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:42.881
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1233
00:54:42.881 --> 00:54:43.714
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I think someone that he had </v>

1234
00:54:44.621 --> 00:54:45.454
<v Speaker 3>done it to someone else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it was kind of going around and then </v>

1235
00:54:46.811 --> 00:54:47.980
<v Speaker 3>I ran into you and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1236
00:54:47.981 --> 00:54:49.150
<v Speaker 3>that just happened to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you were like,</v>

1237
00:54:49.151 --> 00:54:50.770
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where is he?</v>

1238
00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:54.130
<v Speaker 3>And you were immediately like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to beat his ass.</v>

1239
00:54:54.340 --> 00:54:57.280
<v Speaker 3>But simultaneously you were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get security to get this guy.</v>

1240
00:54:57.281 --> 00:54:58.120
<v Speaker 3>It was so awesome.</v>

1241
00:54:58.870 --> 00:55:01.750
<v Speaker 2>Well that guy was a creep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was so creepy.</v>

1242
00:55:01.870 --> 00:55:04.120
<v Speaker 2>I was upset that I wasn't there as it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was happening.</v>

1243
00:55:04.210 --> 00:55:06.190
<v Speaker 2>I now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1244
00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:09.180
<v Speaker 2>that's unfortunate that you're always </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to have to,</v>

1245
00:55:09.210 --> 00:55:13.720
<v Speaker 2>I rarely like enjoy or or that like that</v>

1246
00:55:13.930 --> 00:55:15.190
<v Speaker 3>bonds that you had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1247
00:55:15.610 --> 00:55:16.443
<v Speaker 3>that was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like that as you rarely can be a lady </v>

1248
00:55:19.901 --> 00:55:24.901
<v Speaker 3>after all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't know how to do it.</v>

1249
00:55:25.780 --> 00:55:27.010
<v Speaker 3>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I miss the boat,</v>

1250
00:55:27.070 --> 00:55:27.903
<v Speaker 3>but I</v>

1251
00:55:28.510 --> 00:55:33.510
<v Speaker 2>only reason why you can enjoy it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it is in stark contrast to how I</v>

1252
00:55:33.851 --> 00:55:37.840
<v Speaker 2>behave when people are nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you realize there's a difference,</v>

1253
00:55:37.870 --> 00:55:40.090
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's break class,</v>

1254
00:55:40.150 --> 00:55:43.870
<v Speaker 2>break glass in case of emergency,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that was an emergency.</v>

1255
00:55:43.871 --> 00:55:44.704
<v Speaker 2>Like this is a real creep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's cool to see that coked up assholes </v>

1256
00:55:49.170 --> 00:55:52.090
<v Speaker 2>at that fucking store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lately there's so many coked up.</v>

1257
00:55:52.091 --> 00:55:55.090
<v Speaker 2>Weirdos cook must be making a comeback </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Hollywood,</v>

1258
00:55:55.091 --> 00:55:58.690
<v Speaker 2>it must be kind of like put my blinders </v>
<v Speaker 2>on to it probably.</v>

1259
00:55:58.730 --> 00:55:59.563
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people with fucking </v>

1260
00:56:01.270 --> 00:56:03.910
<v Speaker 2>bright eyes and ideas and business </v>
<v Speaker 2>plans.</v>

1261
00:56:04.780 --> 00:56:05.430
<v Speaker 2>They want to fucking</v>

1262
00:56:05.430 --> 00:56:06.720
<v Speaker 3>pitch away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I need.</v>

1263
00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:08.610
<v Speaker 3>If you're the overactive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm the opposite.</v>

1264
00:56:08.611 --> 00:56:10.170
<v Speaker 3>Like if I see a bed out of the corner of</v>
<v Speaker 3>mine,</v>

1265
00:56:10.180 --> 00:56:11.130
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

1266
00:56:12.060 --> 00:56:15.570
<v Speaker 3>that can be great right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's my avoidance tactic.</v>

1267
00:56:15.620 --> 00:56:17.580
<v Speaker 3>Just like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got To sleep.</v>

1268
00:56:18.090 --> 00:56:19.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't do that.</v>

1269
00:56:20.180 --> 00:56:22.280
<v Speaker 2>Does work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just lie there and think,</v>

1270
00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:24.100
<v Speaker 2>but my sort of route</v>

1271
00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:27.130
<v Speaker 1>of the discovering like my hidden anger </v>
<v Speaker 1>core,</v>

1272
00:56:27.131 --> 00:56:28.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1273
00:56:28.241 --> 00:56:30.340
<v Speaker 1>like peeling off the layers of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1274
00:56:30.341 --> 00:56:32.020
<v Speaker 1>she's uncomfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's quiet,</v>

1275
00:56:32.021 --> 00:56:33.400
<v Speaker 1>she doesn't react.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

1276
00:56:33.450 --> 00:56:33.710
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1277
00:56:33.710 --> 00:56:34.810
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're in there.</v>

1278
00:56:34.811 --> 00:56:38.500
<v Speaker 1>You've just buried them like all of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>feelings in like politeness.</v>

1279
00:56:38.550 --> 00:56:41.170
<v Speaker 1>And so that's comedy has helped me with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that too.</v>

1280
00:56:41.171 --> 00:56:44.170
<v Speaker 1>Cause I early on I was like way too </v>
<v Speaker 1>reactive.</v>

1281
00:56:44.171 --> 00:56:45.070
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1282
00:56:45.071 --> 00:56:46.810
<v Speaker 1>what do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like talking to an audience member,</v>

1283
00:56:46.811 --> 00:56:47.410
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1284
00:56:47.410 --> 00:56:50.290
<v Speaker 1>you're in control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you tell them where it's going,</v>

1285
00:56:50.291 --> 00:56:52.360
<v Speaker 1>you steer it like yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can listen to it.</v>

1286
00:56:52.361 --> 00:56:54.890
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's,</v>

1287
00:56:54.970 --> 00:56:55.803
<v Speaker 1>it's teaching me that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How to like drive the train instead of </v>

1288
00:57:00.461 --> 00:57:01.294
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be open to you and listen </v>

1289
00:57:03.221 --> 00:57:05.500
<v Speaker 1>and go wherever you want me to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1290
00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:09.010
<v Speaker 1>and just react to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's also like,</v>

1291
00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:09.993
<v Speaker 1>there's a weird feedback loop thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on there because people like it </v>

1292
00:57:12.971 --> 00:57:14.500
<v Speaker 1>when you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh well what do you think?</v>

1293
00:57:14.810 --> 00:57:15.643
<v Speaker 1>So you liked the fact that they liked </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you do that and then you avoid the </v>

1294
00:57:19.241 --> 00:57:20.074
<v Speaker 1>conflict that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you have to swallow it for the </v>

1295
00:57:22.121 --> 00:57:23.050
<v Speaker 1>rest of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

1296
00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:25.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's totally,</v>

1297
00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:30.650
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1298
00:57:31.530 --> 00:57:35.370
<v Speaker 2>Well I mean it's like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like being a person and being a comic,</v>

1299
00:57:35.371 --> 00:57:38.190
<v Speaker 2>very similar in that you're never done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's never done.</v>

1300
00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:40.530
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're always trying to fix that thing.</v>

1301
00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:42.810
<v Speaker 2>Was trying to tweak it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make it a little better.</v>

1302
00:57:43.830 --> 00:57:44.663
<v Speaker 2>And then that's like one of the big </v>
<v Speaker 2>arguments for writing new material to </v>

1303
00:57:48.691 --> 00:57:51.000
<v Speaker 2>the idea is that every time you write a </v>
<v Speaker 2>new act,</v>

1304
00:57:51.390 --> 00:57:54.300
<v Speaker 2>especially when you have to like really </v>
<v Speaker 2>so special or something like that,</v>

1305
00:57:54.510 --> 00:57:55.800
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause you,</v>

1306
00:57:55.801 --> 00:57:58.140
<v Speaker 2>you understand comedy better than you </v>
<v Speaker 2>did two years ago.</v>

1307
00:57:58.230 --> 00:57:59.063
<v Speaker 2>You're just going to be better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you've really been paying attention </v>

1308
00:58:01.770 --> 00:58:03.330
<v Speaker 2>and you really are looking at it </v>
<v Speaker 2>correctly,</v>

1309
00:58:03.331 --> 00:58:05.400
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But God,</v>

1310
00:58:05.401 --> 00:58:07.020
<v Speaker 2>it's so hard cause you right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to avoid it.</v>

1311
00:58:07.021 --> 00:58:08.340
<v Speaker 2>You want to go to that bed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's right there.</v>

1312
00:58:08.970 --> 00:58:09.810
<v Speaker 2>It's right there in radio land.</v>

1313
00:58:12.470 --> 00:58:14.150
<v Speaker 1>CHICAGO,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zee.</v>

1314
00:58:17.130 --> 00:58:18.210
<v Speaker 1>Hello.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1315
00:58:18.211 --> 00:58:20.500
<v Speaker 1>you get your pets in the bed with you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1316
00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:22.530
<v Speaker 1>They keep 'em out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause my allergies.</v>

1317
00:58:22.531 --> 00:58:26.790
<v Speaker 1>But then when they surround me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you allergic to?</v>

1318
00:58:27.330 --> 00:58:29.520
<v Speaker 1>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have any cats and dogs and you're</v>

1319
00:58:29.521 --> 00:58:30.510
<v Speaker 1>allergic to them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1320
00:58:30.511 --> 00:58:33.000
<v Speaker 1>my husband got the cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what put it over the edge.</v>

1321
00:58:33.001 --> 00:58:35.940
<v Speaker 1>I had two dogs for the longest time and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I ignored it.</v>

1322
00:58:35.941 --> 00:58:36.774
<v Speaker 1>And then it's the weather and the cat </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I just went over this edge where I </v>

1323
00:58:39.271 --> 00:58:43.350
<v Speaker 1>always had like this really bad cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I finally had to go and I tried</v>

1324
00:58:43.351 --> 00:58:48.150
<v Speaker 1>to all the organic things and I finally </v>
<v Speaker 1>had to go and get the like twice a week.</v>

1325
00:58:48.151 --> 00:58:48.984
<v Speaker 1>But when they tested it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like everything just like paper </v>

1326
00:58:51.811 --> 00:58:55.320
<v Speaker 1>and pollen and pets and a paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're allergic to paper.</v>

1327
00:58:55.350 --> 00:58:56.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1328
00:58:57.660 --> 00:58:58.493
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then I got those shots twice a week </v>

1329
00:59:00.660 --> 00:59:03.060
<v Speaker 1>and with the shots do I kind of Miss My </v>
<v Speaker 1>allergist?</v>

1330
00:59:03.060 --> 00:59:05.110
<v Speaker 1>We would have little four minute chats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1331
00:59:05.300 --> 00:59:09.420
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're an ocular rating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you start doing a little bit and then</v>

1332
00:59:09.421 --> 00:59:13.020
<v Speaker 1>you build up your tolerance so they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>inoculate you for cat dander.</v>

1333
00:59:13.950 --> 00:59:14.940
<v Speaker 1>Real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1334
00:59:14.941 --> 00:59:18.540
<v Speaker 1>That's sort of an allergy shot is I </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't even know that there were allergy</v>

1335
00:59:18.541 --> 00:59:19.650
<v Speaker 1>shots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1336
00:59:19.651 --> 00:59:21.090

<v Speaker 1>it's like a little cocktail,</v>

1337
00:59:21.230 --> 00:59:22.063
<v Speaker 1>like all the things cocktail for me of </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the things that I'm allergic to and </v>

1338
00:59:25.851 --> 00:59:29.300
<v Speaker 1>then I just build up my tolerance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1339
00:59:29.390 --> 00:59:31.160
<v Speaker 1>So now if you're around a cat and </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing,</v>

1342
00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:36.583
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it used to be if a cat just like </v>

1343
00:59:39.411 --> 00:59:41.570
<v Speaker 1>licked you or touched your hand or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>

1344
00:59:41.571 --> 00:59:43.610
<v Speaker 1>you would get like little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little rub.</v>

1345

1349
00:59:49.460 --> 00:59:51.920
<v Speaker 1>We had to figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It took a while.</v>

1350
00:59:51.921 --> 00:59:55.010
<v Speaker 1>She'd like wake up with puffy eyes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then we got a tested and realized it was</v>

1358
01:00:06.261 --> 01:00:09.290
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It depends on like where my system is of</v>

<v Speaker 1>how it affects me sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like the other pillow.</v>

<v Speaker 1>like Styrofoam.</v>

1363
01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:22.610

<v Speaker 1>my making this up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it feels like bullshit.</v>

1367
01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:33.930
<v Speaker 1>I got the Epi pen once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

<v Speaker 1>So you got the shots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body went into shock because of all</v>

1370
01:00:40.161 --> 01:00:40.994
<v Speaker 1>the allergic shots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they had a fucking boom right </v>

1371
01:00:43.081 --> 01:00:44.660
<v Speaker 1>in the thigh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And My allergist was like,</v>

1372
01:00:45.050 --> 01:00:46.850
<v Speaker 1>he did it in my arm and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

1373
01:00:46.851 --> 01:00:47.684
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even raise it that much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I went home and I was reading and </v>

1374
01:00:50.091 --> 01:00:51.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1377
01:00:55.221 --> 01:00:59.000
<v Speaker 1>Like I worked out and I need to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't for like a full 10 minutes.</v>

1378
01:00:59.090 --> 01:01:01.370
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just subconsciously gone.</v>

1379
01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:02.413
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta go take a shower or something </v>

1380
01:01:03.621 --> 01:01:08.621
<v Speaker 1>and then I lift it up and it was like </v>
<v Speaker 1>traveling and then I just was like,</v>

1381
01:01:10.550 --> 01:01:12.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm having a attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I need a Benadryl.</v>

1382
01:01:12.861 --> 01:01:14.600
<v Speaker 1>And like no one was listening to me and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1383
01:01:14.601 --> 01:01:15.850
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I need a Benadryl.</v>

1384
01:01:15.870 --> 01:01:16.790
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

1385
01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:19.850
<v Speaker 1>I was looking for the Benadryl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't find it.</v>

1386
01:01:20.090 --> 01:01:21.950
<v Speaker 1>Called my allergist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

1387
01:01:22.010 --> 01:01:24.440
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just come here right now.</v>

1388
01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:25.813
<v Speaker 1>And then I drove there just like so </v>
<v Speaker 1>scared cause I could feel it traveling </v>

1389
01:01:29.691 --> 01:01:31.230
<v Speaker 1>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1390
01:01:31.370 --> 01:01:32.203
<v Speaker 1>panicking but also trying to like manage</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when you panic and it's a good </v>

1391
01:01:35.481 --> 01:01:37.640
<v Speaker 1>thing because you have to act fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I thought,</v>

1392
01:01:37.930 --> 01:01:40.490
<v Speaker 1>are my eyes going to close up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is my throat going to close up?</v>

1393
01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:45.470
<v Speaker 1>And then went in there full on Epi pen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's awesome.</v>

1394
01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:47.630
<v Speaker 1>It was really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It felt like,</v>

1395
01:01:48.890 --> 01:01:51.650
<v Speaker 1>it honestly felt like I was about to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>onstage.</v>

1396
01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:53.180
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a rush.</v>

1397
01:01:53.250 --> 01:01:56.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was kind of great feeling,</v>

1398
01:01:56.210 --> 01:02:00.500
<v Speaker 1>but it's almost like it like feels like </v>
<v Speaker 1>tinny and like real trevally like,</v>

1399
01:02:00.970 --> 01:02:05.700
<v Speaker 1>like you get like for a few seconds and </v>
<v Speaker 1>trevally bless Augusta.</v>

1400
01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:10.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like not even caffeine,</v>

1401
01:02:10.221 --> 01:02:11.930
<v Speaker 1>like beyond caffeine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1402
01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:13.700
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a pure,</v>

1403
01:02:13.701 --> 01:02:14.534
<v Speaker 1>a dry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it felt like a real exciting standup </v>

1404
01:02:17.481 --> 01:02:18.310
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1405
01:02:18.310 --> 01:02:20.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm really excited to go on stage</v>

1406
01:02:20.250 --> 01:02:21.083
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that immediately stops the allergic </v>

1407
01:02:22.831 --> 01:02:23.664
<v Speaker 2>reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1408
01:02:23.850 --> 01:02:25.530
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's incredible.</v>

1409
01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:28.350
<v Speaker 2>What do you got it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>

1410
01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:31.530
<v Speaker 2>The EPI pen is adrenaline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

1411
01:02:31.531 --> 01:02:34.200
<v Speaker 2>That's a crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done that on an episode of 24 where</v>

1412
01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:37.680
<v Speaker 2>the character dies and the Epi pen in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the heart and they wake back up.</v>

1413
01:02:37.830 --> 01:02:41.550
<v Speaker 2>So epinephrin is adrenaline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1414
01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:42.930
<v Speaker 2>It was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked it.</v>

1415
01:02:42.990 --> 01:02:45.870
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't do it every day if I could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should do it every day.</v>

1416
01:02:46.170 --> 01:02:48.990
<v Speaker 2>It's a hormone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>neurotransmitter and medication.</v>

1417
01:02:48.991 --> 01:02:49.824
<v Speaker 2>Epinephrin is normally produced,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but both of your dream of glands and </v>

1418
01:02:52.561 --> 01:02:53.394
<v Speaker 2>certain neurons plays an important role.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fight or flight response by </v>

1419
01:02:56.461 --> 01:02:59.940
<v Speaker 2>increasing blood flow to the muscles </v>
<v Speaker 2>output or the heart trouble feel.</v>

1420
01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:02.820
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pupil dilation.</v>

1421
01:03:03.450 --> 01:03:04.283
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then then other stuff that you get </v>

1422
01:03:06.601 --> 01:03:08.370
<v Speaker 2>from luck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cold shock proteins.</v>

1423
01:03:08.371 --> 01:03:10.350
<v Speaker 2>That's norepinephrine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it is?</v>

1424
01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:14.210
<v Speaker 2>That's the way that Doctor Rhonda </v>
<v Speaker 2>Patrick was a,</v>

1425
01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:19.220
<v Speaker 2>she's a giant proponent of a sauna and </v>
<v Speaker 2>also of cryotherapy.</v>

1426
01:03:19.650 --> 01:03:24.350
<v Speaker 2>And she was talking about the benefits </v>
<v Speaker 2>of cold shock proteins.</v>

1427
01:03:24.351 --> 01:03:25.650
<v Speaker 2>And one of them is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1428
01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:28.800
<v Speaker 2>your body freaks out when you go into </v>
<v Speaker 2>those cryotherapy chambers,</v>

1429
01:03:28.801 --> 01:03:29.634
<v Speaker 2>cause it's like 250 degrees below zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you get this big powerful burst of </v>

1430
01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:36.660
<v Speaker 2>norepinephrine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get cold shock proteins.</v>

1431
01:03:36.661 --> 01:03:37.494
<v Speaker 2>These sidechains cause your body's </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to react to the fact that you </v>

1432
01:03:39.241 --> 01:03:42.660
<v Speaker 2>have this massive cold environment that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just trapped in.</v>

1433
01:03:42.661 --> 01:03:43.494
<v Speaker 2>It's like so fucking cold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your body freaks out and it produces </v>

1434
01:03:45.961 --> 01:03:48.840
<v Speaker 2>this really radical anti inflammation </v>
<v Speaker 2>process.</v>

1435
01:03:50.010 --> 01:03:51.590
<v Speaker 2>And one of them is this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1436
01:03:51.591 --> 01:03:54.190
<v Speaker 2>And that's as a trend that known also </v>
<v Speaker 2>known as noradrenaline.</v>

1437
01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:55.130
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also,</v>

1438
01:03:55.130 --> 01:03:57.270
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because adrenaline is epinephrine.</v>

1439
01:03:57.480 --> 01:04:00.630
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So nor epinephrin that it makes you feel</v>

1440
01:04:00.631 --> 01:04:01.464
<v Speaker 2>so good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like one of the reasons why I </v>

1441
01:04:02.791 --> 01:04:05.760
<v Speaker 2>really liked going to the cryo chamber </v>
<v Speaker 2>just to get out,</v>

1442
01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:07.380
<v Speaker 2>get out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1443
01:04:07.381 --> 01:04:08.040
<v Speaker 2>You get out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

1444
01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:08.873
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

1445
01:04:11.090 --> 01:04:11.923
<v Speaker 2>Putting your body under stress and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>it releases that Doctor Rhonda Patrick </v>

1446
01:04:17.701 --> 01:04:20.070
<v Speaker 2>is also a big proponent of that in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sauna.</v>

1447
01:04:20.071 --> 01:04:21.840
<v Speaker 2>And that's why I installed that sauna </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

1448
01:04:22.290 --> 01:04:24.120
<v Speaker 2>Call it a protein.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1449
01:04:24.121 --> 01:04:24.954
<v Speaker 2>Heat shock proteins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He chocked proteins and cold shock </v>

1450
01:04:26.701 --> 01:04:27.534
<v Speaker 2>proteins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So proteins that are produced by your </v>

1451
01:04:29.011 --> 01:04:32.610
<v Speaker 2>body to deal with the effects of extreme</v>
<v Speaker 2>heat or cold.</v>

1452
01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:37.080
<v Speaker 2>See your body reacts to stress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Too much heat will kill you for sure.</v>

1453
01:04:37.081 --> 01:04:37.914
<v Speaker 2>Too much cold will kill you for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But a little bit is actually very good </v>

1454
01:04:40.441 --> 01:04:41.274
<v Speaker 2>for you because your body has a response</v>
<v Speaker 2>to that and that response sort of </v>

1455
01:04:44.371 --> 01:04:45.204
<v Speaker 2>invigorates your entire system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of speaks to what you're talking </v>

1456
01:04:47.821 --> 01:04:48.654
<v Speaker 2>about performing and a ceiling stressing</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself going through that stress in </v>

1457
01:04:53.071 --> 01:04:55.450
<v Speaker 2>order to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1458
01:04:56.580 --> 01:04:57.413
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I listened to a chunk of that ell and </v>

1459
01:04:59.490 --> 01:05:00.900
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joey Diaz.</v>

1460
01:05:01.590 --> 01:05:02.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which by the way,</v>

1461
01:05:02.791 --> 01:05:05.260
<v Speaker 2>it was amazing the way you guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>communicate it.</v>

1462
01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:06.650
<v Speaker 2>That was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty cool.</v>

1463
01:05:06.980 --> 01:05:07.813
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

1464
01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:08.693
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1465
01:05:08.850 --> 01:05:11.810
<v Speaker 2>the pyramid of athletics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1466
01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:13.770
<v Speaker 2>Every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're living there.</v>

1467
01:05:13.771 --> 01:05:16.410
<v Speaker 2>It just made me think about my own life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you know,</v>

1468
01:05:16.411 --> 01:05:17.244
<v Speaker 2>my parents really hard to like make me </v>
<v Speaker 2>comfortable and here's your TV and you </v>

1469
01:05:21.521 --> 01:05:22.354
<v Speaker 2>go to school and you come home from </v>
<v Speaker 2>school and how that's the goal in like </v>

1470
01:05:27.011 --> 01:05:30.580
<v Speaker 2>suburban life is to just be coffee </v>
<v Speaker 2>counter ball.</v>

1471
01:05:31.090 --> 01:05:33.730
<v Speaker 2>We don't realize it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is all because people before us</v>

1472
01:05:33.731 --> 01:05:36.700
<v Speaker 2>weren't we just only living in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment where people are supposed to</v>

1473
01:05:36.701 --> 01:05:38.140
<v Speaker 2>be comfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1474
01:05:38.141 --> 01:05:38.974
<v Speaker 2>just two generations back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's an immigrant and everyone's </v>

1475
01:05:40.751 --> 01:05:43.360
<v Speaker 2>really concerned about starving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I have to do,</v>

1476
01:05:43.420 --> 01:05:46.120
<v Speaker 2>go back to the 1920s everyone's worried </v>
<v Speaker 2>about fucking dying.</v>

1477
01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:47.073
<v Speaker 2>There were millions of people died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like even during World War Two millions </v>

1478
01:05:50.381 --> 01:05:54.370
<v Speaker 2>of people died by starvation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a real concern.</v>

1479
01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:55.900
<v Speaker 2>I remember you saying to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

1480
01:05:55.901 --> 01:05:57.010
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it produced,</v>

1481
01:05:57.100 --> 01:05:57.933
<v Speaker 2>it produces really good athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might not be like the nicest </v>

1482
01:06:01.571 --> 01:06:02.404
<v Speaker 2>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's no way you get really nice </v>

1483
01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:08.470
<v Speaker 2>situations that produced the world's </v>
<v Speaker 2>best combat sports athletes just doesn't</v>

1484
01:06:08.471 --> 01:06:11.530
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to be strong as fuck mentally,</v>

1485
01:06:11.531 --> 01:06:12.364
<v Speaker 2>physically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to have experienced adversity </v>

1486
01:06:14.441 --> 01:06:15.274
<v Speaker 2>on a level that most people can never </v>
<v Speaker 2>comprehend so that when the shit hits </v>

1487
01:06:17.861 --> 01:06:18.694
<v Speaker 2>the fan that you could look at the other</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy on the other side of the cage like </v>

1488
01:06:22.151 --> 01:06:22.984
<v Speaker 2>Yoel Romero does and goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go fuck you up cause I've </v>

1489
01:06:25.901 --> 01:06:30.130
<v Speaker 2>been through everything already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even then the other guys the same way so</v>

1490
01:06:30.170 --> 01:06:31.540
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't even work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1491
01:06:31.541 --> 01:06:32.374
<v Speaker 2>I don't really relate to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like China fuck up the other dude and </v>

1492
01:06:35.441 --> 01:06:38.180
<v Speaker 2>going through so much adversity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I,</v>

1493
01:06:38.190 --> 01:06:40.360
<v Speaker 2>well I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my point of view is like,</v>

1494
01:06:40.990 --> 01:06:44.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do my chores and I'm so </v>
<v Speaker 2>comfortable right now.</v>

1495
01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:47.950
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm going to deliberately make </v>
<v Speaker 2>myself uncomfortable in order to do what</v>

1496
01:06:47.951 --> 01:06:48.784
<v Speaker 2>I know is good for me and that I enjoy </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing and that I want to have success </v>

1497
01:06:52.331 --> 01:06:54.160
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that takes me to another place in my</v>

1498
01:06:54.161 --> 01:06:55.180
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's,</v>

1499
01:06:55.810 --> 01:06:59.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do it in a very small way.</v>

1500
01:06:59.320 --> 01:06:59.921
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do,</v>

1501
01:06:59.921 --> 01:07:02.200
<v Speaker 2>but it's still really honestly the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

1502
01:07:02.530 --> 01:07:05.050
<v Speaker 2>What [inaudible] is doing and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing is the same thing.</v>

1503
01:07:05.260 --> 01:07:08.320
<v Speaker 2>You're doing something very difficult </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you,</v>

1504
01:07:08.321 --> 01:07:09.880
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you struggle to do it.</v>

1505
01:07:10.090 --> 01:07:13.720
<v Speaker 2>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You push yourself visit [inaudible] want</v>

1506
01:07:13.721 --> 01:07:17.140
<v Speaker 2>to do it and in through doing it you get</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit better at everything.</v>

1507
01:07:17.290 --> 01:07:20.290
<v Speaker 2>Did he talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I only watched the first chunk of it.</v>

1508
01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:21.193
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did he talk about his desire to do that </v>

1509
01:07:23.441 --> 01:07:24.520
<v Speaker 2>or not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1510
01:07:24.521 --> 01:07:26.270
<v Speaker 2>Like yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1511
01:07:26.271 --> 01:07:27.520
<v Speaker 2>he dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how does that,</v>

1512
01:07:27.610 --> 01:07:31.480
<v Speaker 2>how does that match with kind of being </v>
<v Speaker 2>put in that system?</v>

1513
01:07:31.870 --> 01:07:35.680
<v Speaker 2>I think you asked that early on too was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like how do they choose,</v>

1514
01:07:35.740 --> 01:07:38.350
<v Speaker 2>how do you choose?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it just want someone who has what?</v>

1515
01:07:38.351 --> 01:07:41.320
<v Speaker 2>If you have the natural ability but you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want to do it,</v>

1516
01:07:41.530 --> 01:07:43.630
<v Speaker 2>well then you won't perform.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't perform,</v>

1517
01:07:43.631 --> 01:07:45.910
<v Speaker 2>you get knocked out of the system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is the desire.</v>

1518
01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:48.820
<v Speaker 2>It does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has to be to be as good as he is.</v>

1519
01:07:48.821 --> 01:07:51.880
<v Speaker 2>There has to be desire to compete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wanted to be a boxer initially said,</v>

1520
01:07:52.060 --> 01:07:52.893
<v Speaker 2>but his father was a boxer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think his brother is a world champion </v>

1521
01:07:55.841 --> 01:07:59.500
<v Speaker 2>boxer as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just a genetic for reek.</v>

1522
01:07:59.950 --> 01:08:03.250
<v Speaker 2>Like there's genetics and Cuba,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was explaining it to me too.</v>

1523
01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:04.720
<v Speaker 2>He's during the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was like,</v>

1524
01:08:04.750 --> 01:08:08.030
<v Speaker 2>anybody that thinks that everyone's on </v>
<v Speaker 2>steroids just go to Cuba where everybody</v>

1525
01:08:08.031 --> 01:08:09.970
<v Speaker 2>is so poor and look at the regular </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

1526
01:08:10.090 --> 01:08:10.900
<v Speaker 2>just the regular people.</v>

1527
01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:12.760
<v Speaker 2>Forget about the athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

1528
01:08:12.790 --> 01:08:14.680
<v Speaker 2>I'll take you to Cuba for two weeks and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll come back.</v>

1529
01:08:14.681 --> 01:08:15.514
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

1530
01:08:15.950 --> 01:08:17.480
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's just really,</v>

1531
01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:18.970
<v Speaker 2>it was a slave colony.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

1532
01:08:19.060 --> 01:08:21.080
<v Speaker 2>they had a hard life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

1533
01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:21.933
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's their Africans that speaks </v>

1534
01:08:23.351 --> 01:08:26.690
<v Speaker 2>Spanish and they live on an island </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's off the coast of Florida.</v>

1535
01:08:26.930 --> 01:08:28.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a crazy spot.</v>

1536
01:08:28.220 --> 01:08:29.053
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was run by a dictator forever and </v>

1537
01:08:31.041 --> 01:08:33.650
<v Speaker 2>they had some of the best athletes in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world in boxing,</v>

1538
01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:34.633
<v Speaker 2>in judo and wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just world class athletes that had </v>

1539
01:08:38.811 --> 01:08:40.430
<v Speaker 2>mental toughness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The likes of,</v>

1540
01:08:40.820 --> 01:08:41.653
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's hard for the average person </v>
<v Speaker 2>even comprehend with those people are </v>

1541
01:08:44.211 --> 01:08:45.044
<v Speaker 2>capable of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of it is because of that </v>

1542
01:08:46.581 --> 01:08:49.070
<v Speaker 2>really brutal system that you all talked</v>
<v Speaker 2>about on the podcast.</v>

1543
01:08:49.071 --> 01:08:50.900
<v Speaker 2>Amazing stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>

1544
01:08:51.140 --> 01:08:52.160
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

1545
01:08:52.370 --> 01:08:54.770
<v Speaker 2>just imagining that this guy went </v>
<v Speaker 2>through that,</v>

1546
01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:57.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fascinating because that's not what</v>

1547
01:08:57.650 --> 01:08:58.190
<v Speaker 2>I want to do.</v>

1548
01:08:58.190 --> 01:08:59.400
<v Speaker 2>It's not what you want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1549
01:08:59.401 --> 01:09:03.260
<v Speaker 2>But you just think like that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>person out there that can do that.</v>

1550
01:09:03.261 --> 01:09:07.250
<v Speaker 2>And look what happens on the other end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get that guy like Jesus.</v>

1551
01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:09.680
<v Speaker 2>He was just being in the room with him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

1552
01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:13.700
<v Speaker 2>he's like a fucking superhero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like cheese us that,</v>

1553
01:09:13.730 --> 01:09:17.450
<v Speaker 2>that is the product of genetics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ruthless training,</v>

1554
01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:19.160
<v Speaker 2>ruthless environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1555
01:09:19.161 --> 01:09:23.450
<v Speaker 2>one of the most complex and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sophisticated sports training systems in</v>

1556
01:09:23.451 --> 01:09:27.020
<v Speaker 2>the world with boxing and with wrestling</v>
<v Speaker 2>and with Judah.</v>

1557
01:09:27.021 --> 01:09:28.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're just phenomenal over </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1558
01:09:28.930 --> 01:09:30.380
<v Speaker 2>It was cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was really inspiring.</v>

1559
01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:32.780
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing for way for someone like </v>
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

1560
01:09:32.781 --> 01:09:37.781
<v Speaker 2>like I don't relate necessarily to what </v>
<v Speaker 2>he does is like foreign and amazing.</v>

1561
01:09:38.481 --> 01:09:40.730
<v Speaker 2>But through my own life it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1562
01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:41.833
<v Speaker 2>I can be not comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why it seems like a </v>

1563
01:09:45.891 --> 01:09:46.724
<v Speaker 2>contradiction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not like that's what we're </v>

1564
01:09:48.861 --> 01:09:51.020
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be doing.</v>

1565
01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:54.410
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when you get through that you have a</v>

1566
01:09:54.411 --> 01:09:57.440
<v Speaker 2>sense of satisfaction and then it feels </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad.</v>

1567
01:09:57.441 --> 01:10:02.441
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't something that was introduced </v>
<v Speaker 2>to me or taught to me really.</v>

1568
01:10:03.230 --> 01:10:05.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did sports a little bit.</v>

1569
01:10:05.210 --> 01:10:07.070
<v Speaker 2>Did you figure it out just through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pursuit?</v>

1570
01:10:07.790 --> 01:10:08.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1571
01:10:08.510 --> 01:10:13.510
<v Speaker 2>there was nothing that I really </v>
<v Speaker 2>committed to that much or knew how to,</v>

1572
01:10:13.881 --> 01:10:16.430
<v Speaker 2>or if I did it was maybe one small </v>
<v Speaker 2>aspect.</v>

1573
01:10:16.431 --> 01:10:19.610
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't really a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

1574
01:10:19.611 --> 01:10:20.444
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the messaging was try to get by and try </v>

1575
01:10:22.851 --> 01:10:26.030
<v Speaker 2>to try to get some shitty job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1576
01:10:26.031 --> 01:10:28.150
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1577
01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:30.960
<v Speaker 2>it's weird because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the not,</v>

1578
01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:33.620
<v Speaker 2>not like woe is me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like just knowing the,</v>

1579
01:10:33.621 --> 01:10:38.621
<v Speaker 2>even that you had choices that you could</v>
<v Speaker 2>try to beat something great.</v>

1580
01:10:40.380 --> 01:10:45.380
<v Speaker 2>That wasn't really something that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussed or on the table.</v>

1581
01:10:46.100 --> 01:10:48.980
<v Speaker 2>Well wasn't that does not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one aspect of all comedy.</v>

1582
01:10:49.010 --> 01:10:53.930
<v Speaker 2>Like they're not a lot of people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about success or the process of,</v>

1583
01:10:54.170 --> 01:10:56.810
<v Speaker 2>it's more of like playing everything low</v>
<v Speaker 2>key.</v>

1584
01:10:57.020 --> 01:11:00.500
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or like a sarcasm or a,</v>

1585
01:11:01.580 --> 01:11:04.270
<v Speaker 2>it's not like that's the sincerity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1586
01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:04.820
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

1587
01:11:04.820 --> 01:11:07.430
<v Speaker 2>Of being a hipster is that you've got </v>
<v Speaker 2>that distance.</v>

1588
01:11:07.431 --> 01:11:08.264
<v Speaker 2>You're not really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why I love the comedy store as </v>

1589
01:11:10.191 --> 01:11:13.040
<v Speaker 2>well because it's like the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the opposite.</v>

1590
01:11:13.050 --> 01:11:13.883
<v Speaker 2>It's like what's your thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And every been super honest and open </v>

1591
01:11:17.071 --> 01:11:17.904
<v Speaker 2>about like bombings and good sets and </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad sets and jokes had just fell right </v>

1592
01:11:22.051 --> 01:11:22.884
<v Speaker 2>in their face like that back bar area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So brutal with the people who just come </v>

1593
01:11:26.311 --> 01:11:27.001
<v Speaker 2>back there and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1594
01:11:27.001 --> 01:11:28.530
<v Speaker 2>I just ate a fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>played a shit.</v>

1595
01:11:29.250 --> 01:11:32.190
<v Speaker 2>Like people are just so honest about it </v>
<v Speaker 2>when they come downstairs,</v>

1596
01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:35.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's great place.</v>

1597
01:11:36.090 --> 01:11:38.100
<v Speaker 2>I feel super fortunate in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1598
01:11:38.340 --> 01:11:40.560
<v Speaker 2>I missed it so much coming back.</v>

1599
01:11:40.890 --> 01:11:43.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a place for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sarcasm and the,</v>

1600
01:11:43.711 --> 01:11:44.544
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure Thomson [inaudible] does that all </v>

1601
01:11:46.651 --> 01:11:48.210
<v Speaker 2>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's also sincere as well.</v>

1602
01:11:48.230 --> 01:11:49.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

1603
01:11:49.081 --> 01:11:51.900
<v Speaker 2>there's a thing that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an insecurity.</v>

1604
01:11:52.130 --> 01:11:55.050
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a defense mechanism and that's</v>

1605
01:11:55.051 --> 01:11:57.990
<v Speaker 2>what a lot of people do it for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They pretend they're above it all,</v>

1606
01:11:58.200 --> 01:11:59.490
<v Speaker 2>but no one's above it all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1607
01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:00.960
<v Speaker 2>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't pretend you're above it all.</v>

1608
01:12:00.961 --> 01:12:02.610
<v Speaker 2>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can do it for fun.</v>

1609
01:12:02.850 --> 01:12:03.683
<v Speaker 2>But pretending you're actually above it </v>
<v Speaker 2>all you're missing out like nobody </v>

1610
01:12:06.121 --> 01:12:07.890
<v Speaker 2>believes you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

1611
01:12:08.100 --> 01:12:09.630
<v Speaker 2>it's like pretending you're psychic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you ho?</v>

1612
01:12:09.660 --> 01:12:11.940
<v Speaker 2>You know magic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody fucking believes you.</v>

1613
01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:13.020
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you keep down,</v>

1614
01:12:13.020 --> 01:12:13.853
<v Speaker 2>act going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep your fucking fake mustache on your </v>

1615
01:12:15.511 --> 01:12:18.450
<v Speaker 2>Cape and your top hat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel that's like,</v>

1616
01:12:18.510 --> 01:12:21.540
<v Speaker 2>that's silly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's doing it occasionally.</v>

1617
01:12:21.541 --> 01:12:24.120
<v Speaker 2>Every now and then it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all do it to each other all the time,</v>

1618
01:12:24.390 --> 01:12:28.350
<v Speaker 2>but if you have a complete lack of </v>
<v Speaker 2>ability to communicate sincerely,</v>

1619
01:12:28.351 --> 01:12:30.640
<v Speaker 2>that's not being hip or cool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1620
01:12:30.690 --> 01:12:31.523
<v Speaker 2>That's a defense mechanism and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid one because you don't have much </v>

1621
01:12:34.231 --> 01:12:36.000
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a hundred years.</v>

1622
01:12:36.001 --> 01:12:37.420
<v Speaker 2>If you're lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll go,</v>

1623
01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:38.333
<v Speaker 2>they go by like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have $100 you spend a dollar a </v>

1624
01:12:40.771 --> 01:12:42.450
<v Speaker 2>day before you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're fucking broke.</v>

1625
01:12:42.660 --> 01:12:43.493
<v Speaker 2>That's life.</v>

1626
01:12:43.610 --> 01:12:45.230
<v Speaker 3>My son was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where did Michael,</v>

1627
01:12:45.350 --> 01:12:46.970
<v Speaker 3>how old was Michael Jackson when he </v>
<v Speaker 3>died?</v>

1628
01:12:46.971 --> 01:12:47.750
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah.</v>

1629
01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:49.670
<v Speaker 3>In his fifties he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1630
01:12:49.730 --> 01:12:50.750
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that.</v>

1631
01:12:50.751 --> 01:12:52.490
<v Speaker 3>Like that sounded right to him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1632
01:12:52.590 --> 01:12:54.710
<v Speaker 3>ah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People don't die until much,</v>

1633
01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:57.160
<v Speaker 2>basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's me.</v>

1634
01:12:57.670 --> 01:12:59.560
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Michael Jackson's a craziest case of all</v>

1635
01:12:59.561 --> 01:13:00.011
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1636
01:13:00.011 --> 01:13:00.844
<v Speaker 2>Cause he was giving him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they was in administering anesthesia </v>

1637
01:13:02.891 --> 01:13:05.410
<v Speaker 2>every night so we can go to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

1638
01:13:05.890 --> 01:13:06.723
<v Speaker 2>I was playing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was playing a want to be starting </v>

1639
01:13:08.801 --> 01:13:10.050
<v Speaker 2>something and uh,</v>

1640
01:13:11.130 --> 01:13:11.963
<v Speaker 3>thriller in the car on the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>taking my son to school and I start </v>

1641
01:13:15.151 --> 01:13:19.440
<v Speaker 3>crying just because it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you explain</v>

1642
01:13:20.410 --> 01:13:23.800
<v Speaker 2>what he was and how monumental,</v>

1643
01:13:24.930 --> 01:13:25.763
<v Speaker 3>what he did was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can remember seeing him dancing the </v>

1644
01:13:28.351 --> 01:13:33.351
<v Speaker 3>Billie Jean and like how kind of like </v>
<v Speaker 3>broke the mold for music and the persona</v>

1645
01:13:35.310 --> 01:13:37.560
<v Speaker 3>that he had and that level of </v>
<v Speaker 3>creativity.</v>

1646
01:13:38.390 --> 01:13:40.490
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1647
01:13:40.491 --> 01:13:41.324
<v Speaker 2>it was weird to be in the car with us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with my kid who doesn't really know the </v>

1648
01:13:45.501 --> 01:13:46.790
<v Speaker 2>name but didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1649
01:13:47.140 --> 01:13:48.860
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

1650
01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:52.010
<v Speaker 2>that's not part of his life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not part of his life.</v>

1651
01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:54.830
<v Speaker 2>Maybe she introduced him to that movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that documentary.</v>

1652
01:13:54.940 --> 01:13:58.250
<v Speaker 2>Was that the one documentary that did </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is it?</v>

1653
01:13:58.310 --> 01:13:59.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1654
01:13:59.610 --> 01:14:03.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that get into the drugs and stuff?</v>

1655
01:14:04.010 --> 01:14:05.660
<v Speaker 2>And how many years was he doing it for?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1656
01:14:05.690 --> 01:14:07.520
<v Speaker 2>so sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Very Long,</v>

1657
01:14:07.700 --> 01:14:09.310
<v Speaker 2>but here's one of the more fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 2>things is,</v>

1658
01:14:09.311 --> 01:14:11.680
<v Speaker 2>this is something I speculated a long </v>
<v Speaker 2>time ago.</v>

1659
01:14:12.190 --> 01:14:13.023
<v Speaker 2>His doctor who went to jail for giving </v>
<v Speaker 2>him the anesthesia also testified that </v>

1660
01:14:17.351 --> 01:14:18.184
<v Speaker 2>Michael Jackson was chemically castrated</v>
<v Speaker 2>by his parents when he was young to </v>

1661
01:14:20.921 --> 01:14:23.740
<v Speaker 2>preserve his voice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I suspected.</v>

1662
01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:26.740
<v Speaker 2>I suspect that I talked about on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast like years ago,</v>

1663
01:14:26.741 --> 01:14:29.210
<v Speaker 2>I was saying this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I think he was a cast Strada,</v>

1664
01:14:29.710 --> 01:14:30.543
<v Speaker 2>which is they take young boys and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>used to do this with opera and they </v>

1665
01:14:33.281 --> 01:14:34.114
<v Speaker 2>would castrate them at a very young age </v>
<v Speaker 2>and because of that their body never </v>

1666
01:14:36.581 --> 01:14:37.600
<v Speaker 2>developed testosterone.</v>

1667
01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:42.310
<v Speaker 2>So they would do at this high piercing </v>
<v Speaker 2>like haunting voice.</v>

1668
01:14:42.490 --> 01:14:44.440
<v Speaker 2>It's very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we played some of the,</v>

1669
01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:49.190
<v Speaker 2>there's only a few recordings of actual </v>
<v Speaker 2>castrol does that are available or cas,</v>

1670
01:14:49.191 --> 01:14:51.280
<v Speaker 2>stratos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of those.</v>

1671
01:14:51.690 --> 01:14:52.660
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

1672
01:14:52.661 --> 01:14:53.494
<v Speaker 2>when you play them they're haunting </v>
<v Speaker 2>cause you realize like this is a kid </v>

1673
01:14:55.901 --> 01:14:58.870
<v Speaker 2>that was castrated as a baby so that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>can be a singer.</v>

1674
01:14:59.230 --> 01:15:03.640
<v Speaker 2>Like this is fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what Michael Jackson's doctor</v>

1675
01:15:03.641 --> 01:15:06.430
<v Speaker 2>said they did to Michael.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did it through chemicals.</v>

1676
01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:09.840
<v Speaker 2>They chemically castrated him the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>way as judy pedophile.</v>

1677
01:15:09.850 --> 01:15:14.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm just trying to regulate a situation </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was already far gone.</v>

1678
01:15:14.140 --> 01:15:15.170
<v Speaker 2>Is that his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1679
01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:16.270
<v Speaker 2>defense?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1680
01:15:16.271 --> 01:15:18.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's no defense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The doctors just fucking,</v>

1681
01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:21.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just killed me.</v>

1682
01:15:21.021 --> 01:15:24.550
<v Speaker 2>It killed Michael Jackson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let them get anesthesia until he died.</v>

1683
01:15:24.850 --> 01:15:28.060
<v Speaker 2>His defense wasn't that he was just </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying there's something else,</v>

1684
01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:28.480
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1685
01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:29.313
<v Speaker 2>Like Michael Jackson was fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like his parents literally chemically </v>

1686
01:15:32.711 --> 01:15:33.544
<v Speaker 2>castrated him to preserve his voice </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he was the lead singer of the </v>

1687
01:15:35.411 --> 01:15:36.244
<v Speaker 2>Jackson five when he was a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was part of what was great </v>

1688
01:15:38.561 --> 01:15:42.460
<v Speaker 2>about him was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh baby one not chance.</v>

1689
01:15:42.550 --> 01:15:43.383
<v Speaker 2>Like that voice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that voice was nothing like anything </v>

1690
01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:49.660
<v Speaker 2>that he would be capable of doing as an </v>
<v Speaker 2>adult.</v>

1691
01:15:49.661 --> 01:15:52.450
<v Speaker 2>If he grew into a man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would have this big old man,</v>

1692
01:15:52.451 --> 01:15:54.980
<v Speaker 2>I want to get some pussy voice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was like,</v>

1693
01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.310
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where's the little Michael?</v>

1694
01:15:57.550 --> 01:15:58.780
<v Speaker 2>He would have like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1695
01:15:58.781 --> 01:15:59.350
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1696
01:15:59.350 --> 01:16:01.780
<v Speaker 2>a barry white voice or something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

1697
01:16:01.781 --> 01:16:03.880
<v Speaker 2>you can't have that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're Michael,</v>

1698
01:16:04.150 --> 01:16:05.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your ABC,</v>

1699
01:16:05.441 --> 01:16:08.210
<v Speaker 2>it's easy as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He may not have gotten that deep,</v>

1700
01:16:08.211 --> 01:16:09.520
<v Speaker 2>but this voice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the guests,</v>

1701
01:16:09.790 --> 01:16:11.920
<v Speaker 2>if you get that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the belief.</v>

1702
01:16:11.950 --> 01:16:14.800
<v Speaker 2>Be believed that he'd never had the </v>
<v Speaker 2>chance.</v>

1703
01:16:15.130 --> 01:16:16.090
<v Speaker 2>I believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1704
01:16:16.091 --> 01:16:16.924
<v Speaker 2>I believe it cause his voice didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>sound anything like a regular mans and </v>

1705
01:16:19.271 --> 01:16:20.650
<v Speaker 2>it didn't sound anything like his </v>
<v Speaker 2>brothers,</v>

1706
01:16:20.890 --> 01:16:24.220
<v Speaker 2>his brothers all look like regular grown</v>
<v Speaker 2>ass men.</v>

1707
01:16:24.850 --> 01:16:29.850
<v Speaker 2>Michael Jackson's deep voice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not deep.</v>

1708
01:16:34.031 --> 01:16:34.590
<v Speaker 2>So that's fine.</v>

1709
01:16:34.590 --> 01:16:35.423
<v Speaker 5>Cold.</v>

1710
01:16:37.170 --> 01:16:39.860
<v Speaker 2>That sounds like John Rivers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It rangy I was looking it up.</v>

1711
01:16:39.870 --> 01:16:40.703
<v Speaker 2>All those places,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm seeing that story about him being </v>

1712
01:16:42.031 --> 01:16:46.080
<v Speaker 2>castrated or like tabloid eats the sun </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that kind of stuff.</v>

1713
01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:47.340
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was,</v>

1714
01:16:47.370 --> 01:16:49.890
<v Speaker 2>wasn't an an interview in like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1715
01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:53.970
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was a UK paper and I just grew,</v>

1716
01:16:53.980 --> 01:16:55.950
<v Speaker 2>it was the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like not the best,</v>

1717
01:16:56.730 --> 01:16:57.600
<v Speaker 2>not the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1718
01:16:57.601 --> 01:16:58.434
<v Speaker 2>The Daily Mail is the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But both of them actually I did the </v>

1719
01:16:59.711 --> 01:17:00.570
<v Speaker 2>same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The equal.</v>

1720
01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:03.180
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm hoping that's so true.</v>

1721
01:17:03.230 --> 01:17:05.520
<v Speaker 2>And the last time you talked about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got some messages.</v>

1722
01:17:05.521 --> 01:17:06.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

1723
01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:09.030
<v Speaker 2>like what's getting videos like this of </v>
<v Speaker 2>showing like examples,</v>

1724
01:17:09.170 --> 01:17:10.003
<v Speaker 2>his deep talking voice that's not deep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of chicks that have </v>

1725
01:17:12.711 --> 01:17:14.180
<v Speaker 2>weighed deeper voices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1726
01:17:15.770 --> 01:17:18.440
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's his deep voice.</v>

1727
01:17:18.710 --> 01:17:20.440
<v Speaker 2>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me tell you.</v>

1728
01:17:20.441 --> 01:17:25.070
<v Speaker 2>You mother Fucker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you listened to the wrong people.</v>

1729
01:17:26.450 --> 01:17:29.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean think of how many women have </v>
<v Speaker 2>ruthlessly deep voices.</v>

1730
01:17:30.460 --> 01:17:31.041
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

1731
01:17:31.041 --> 01:17:32.240
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you a couple of right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1732
01:17:32.780 --> 01:17:35.810
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they did it to him.</v>

1733
01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:39.500
<v Speaker 2>His voice was just phenomenal acumen </v>
<v Speaker 2>nature.</v>

1734
01:17:39.770 --> 01:17:43.850
<v Speaker 2>Like as an adult,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is such a fucking phenomenal song.</v>

1735
01:17:43.860 --> 01:17:44.693
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't sound like anything that </v>
<v Speaker 2>irregular man is capable of saying like </v>

1736
01:17:48.501 --> 01:17:49.334
<v Speaker 2>the notes that he hits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that voice that he had was just </v>

1737
01:17:51.530 --> 01:17:52.520
<v Speaker 2>haunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1738
01:17:52.550 --> 01:17:55.880
<v Speaker 2>Trying to think of who else is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>natural,</v>

1739
01:17:56.520 --> 01:17:58.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>star who has a high boy hold.</v>

1740
01:17:58.900 --> 01:17:59.733
<v Speaker 2>He used to sing in Falsetto,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was very obvious when he was </v>

1741
01:18:02.211 --> 01:18:04.040
<v Speaker 2>doing it that he was doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1742
01:18:04.070 --> 01:18:06.400
<v Speaker 2>Whereas Michael Jackson like that human </v>
<v Speaker 2>nature songs,</v>

1743
01:18:06.450 --> 01:18:09.410
<v Speaker 2>one of my favorites because it's such a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a slow,</v>

1744
01:18:09.650 --> 01:18:13.400
<v Speaker 2>smooth holding of those sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are natural sounds that are coming</v>

1745
01:18:13.401 --> 01:18:14.360
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1746
01:18:14.361 --> 01:18:19.361
<v Speaker 2>it's like this natural,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a warm affectionate tone to it.</v>

1747
01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:20.593
<v Speaker 2>It just doesn't seem like a man's voice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't seem like a woman's voice </v>

1748
01:18:25.131 --> 01:18:26.960
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my point.</v>

1749
01:18:27.330 --> 01:18:30.450
<v Speaker 6>You kept the wrap way talk and that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>different.</v>

1750
01:18:30.451 --> 01:18:33.560
<v Speaker 6>That's like falsetto.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Are you saying that's like a four?</v>

1751
01:18:33.570 --> 01:18:37.020
<v Speaker 6>Sounds like a caricature.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1752
01:18:37.170 --> 01:18:39.570
<v Speaker 6>you could say that it's in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What does this feel like?</v>

1753
01:18:39.571 --> 01:18:40.580
<v Speaker 6>Dancing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Whoo.</v>

1754
01:18:40.810 --> 01:18:42.310
<v Speaker 2>Puberty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Phoneokay yeah.</v>

1755
01:18:42.420 --> 01:18:46.840
<v Speaker 2>Known as Ma mutational false.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a call on my penis.</v>

1756
01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:50.153
<v Speaker 2>It's a type of voice disorder </v>
<v Speaker 2>characterized by habitual use of high </v>

1757
01:18:52.621 --> 01:18:55.430
<v Speaker 2>pitched voice after puberty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1758
01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:56.770
<v Speaker 2>so that some people get that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1759
01:18:56.820 --> 01:18:57.653
<v Speaker 2>It's like a psych psychogenic in nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the other thing is you look at his </v>

1760
01:18:59.851 --> 01:19:03.070
<v Speaker 2>body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had no muscle like his body was like,</v>

1761
01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:05.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean he was a very active guy dancing </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the time,</v>

1762
01:19:05.551 --> 01:19:08.070
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't billing a dancer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was billing a stick.</v>

1763
01:19:08.590 --> 01:19:09.510
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a very,</v>

1764
01:19:09.511 --> 01:19:10.344
<v Speaker 2>very thin guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what you would expect from </v>

1765
01:19:11.671 --> 01:19:13.230
<v Speaker 2>someone who didn't have any </v>
<v Speaker 2>testosterone.</v>

1766
01:19:13.260 --> 01:19:15.000
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't be able to develop any </v>
<v Speaker 2>muscle.</v>

1767
01:19:16.020 --> 01:19:18.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm sticking with my theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might have biases,</v>

1768
01:19:18.331 --> 01:19:21.210
<v Speaker 2>but they're mine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're mine.</v>

1769
01:19:21.350 --> 01:19:22.290
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sticking with it.</v>

1770
01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:25.800
<v Speaker 2>Dig 'em up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dig Him up and check the nuts.</v>

1771
01:19:26.340 --> 01:19:29.250
<v Speaker 2>Degas mop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Summerlin.</v>

1772
01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:30.113
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there anything you'd like to talk </v>

1773
01:19:30.721 --> 01:19:33.480
<v Speaker 2>about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything cause report to in this day and</v>

1774

<v Speaker 2>age?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Geez,</v>

1775
01:19:34.770 --> 01:19:35.603
<v Speaker 2>you just turn it over to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just trying to figure out where </v>

1776
01:19:37.681 --> 01:19:38.180
<v Speaker 2>you stand on.</v>

1777

<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1779
01:19:43.530 --> 01:19:45.050
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

1780
01:19:45.170 --> 01:19:48.320
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>told you I cried to Michael Jackson.</v>

1781
01:19:48.321 --> 01:19:50.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good reason.</v>

1782
01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:53.470
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

1783
01:19:54.930 --> 01:19:57.000
<v Speaker 2>think I'm a hypocrite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In what way?</v>

1784
01:19:57.630 --> 01:20:01.680
<v Speaker 2>The gun control,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1785
01:20:01.710 --> 01:20:05.610
<v Speaker 2>March that is happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1786
01:20:05.970 --> 01:20:07.020
<v Speaker 2>part of me was like,</v>

1787
01:20:08.370 --> 01:20:11.010
<v Speaker 3>I had a friend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a mom who said they're the,</v>

1788
01:20:11.180 --> 01:20:13.950
<v Speaker 3>the march is going on right outside our </v>
<v Speaker 3>house,</v>

1789
01:20:13.951 --> 01:20:14.784
<v Speaker 3>like who wants to join?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as soon as I clicked on the email </v>

1790
01:20:18.271 --> 01:20:20.850
<v Speaker 3>and saw what it was in the pit of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>stomach,</v>

1791
01:20:20.851 --> 01:20:22.080
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1792
01:20:23.430 --> 01:20:26.640
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I covered it up with,</v>

1793
01:20:27.180 --> 01:20:29.760
<v Speaker 3>I should do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This would be a really good thing to do.</v>

1794
01:20:30.630 --> 01:20:35.630
<v Speaker 3>And I was then fighting with myself </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I was like,</v>

1795
01:20:37.711 --> 01:20:39.840
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't have both things at once.</v>

1796
01:20:39.841 --> 01:20:44.841
<v Speaker 3>Either you want to March and do that or </v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't like,</v>

1797
01:20:45.811 --> 01:20:47.460
<v Speaker 3>those are conflicting things.</v>

1798
01:20:51.510 --> 01:20:52.343
<v Speaker 7>MMM.</v>

1799
01:20:52.460 --> 01:20:55.250
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it'll help.</v>

1800
01:20:55.970 --> 01:21:00.970
<v Speaker 3>But then there's another part of me that</v>
<v Speaker 3>really likes when people march,</v>

1801
01:21:01.551 --> 01:21:05.330
<v Speaker 3>because I do think it changes the </v>
<v Speaker 3>attitude.</v>

1802
01:21:05.450 --> 01:21:09.350
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm really happy that the women's </v>
<v Speaker 3>March happened and is happening,</v>

1803
01:21:10.850 --> 01:21:15.850
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't go and I feel like it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a dirty secret and I've started to,</v>

1804
01:21:18.021 --> 01:21:18.854
<v Speaker 3>I have a bit about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's sort of an unformed bit where I </v>

1805
01:21:21.861 --> 01:21:22.461
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1806
01:21:22.461 --> 01:21:25.610
<v Speaker 3>I live in Encino because that's where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you go to give up.</v>

1807
01:21:25.730 --> 01:21:27.320
<v Speaker 3>Like next,</v>
<v Speaker 3>next time you see me,</v>

1808
01:21:27.321 --> 01:21:29.000
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I live in thousand oaks,</v>

1809
01:21:29.001 --> 01:21:30.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm allergic to the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

1810
01:21:31.610 --> 01:21:34.760
<v Speaker 3>and I described like the moment I knew I</v>
<v Speaker 3>had given up was,</v>

1811
01:21:34.790 --> 01:21:37.910
<v Speaker 3>and this is just an exploratory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still don't have it figured out.</v>

1812
01:21:37.911 --> 01:21:38.744
<v Speaker 3>The mom and I knew I had given up was I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was making my stairway from my vagina </v>

1813
01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:47.080
<v Speaker 3>poster with glitter and then I marched </v>
<v Speaker 3>out to the curb and was like,</v>

1814
01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:49.230
<v Speaker 3>it's too hot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1815
01:21:49.730 --> 01:21:51.680
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there'll be parking at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>march.</v>

1816
01:21:52.580 --> 01:21:55.190
<v Speaker 3>And went back inside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you really?</v>

1817
01:21:56.490 --> 01:22:01.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's the joke version,</v>

1818
01:22:02.151 --> 01:22:04.880
<v Speaker 3>but I was very conflicted and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1819
01:22:04.881 --> 01:22:08.030
<v Speaker 3>I should go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And both times I was doing stuff with my</v>

1820
01:22:08.031 --> 01:22:09.260
<v Speaker 3>kid and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1821
01:22:09.261 --> 01:22:11.330
<v Speaker 3>a very small,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mundane day.</v>

1822
01:22:11.331 --> 01:22:13.430
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not doing it.</v>

1823
01:22:13.431 --> 01:22:14.264
<v Speaker 3>And then I saw the women that did it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they talked about being in this crowd </v>

1824
01:22:16.941 --> 01:22:18.590
<v Speaker 3>and how uplifting it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

1825
01:22:18.650 --> 01:22:22.630
<v Speaker 3>that's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm really happy this is happening,</v>

1826
01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:29.760
<v Speaker 3>but yet why is it because I don't care </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm weak?</v>

1827
01:22:30.850 --> 01:22:34.150
<v Speaker 3>Or is it because I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a part of me that believes it's,</v>

1828
01:22:34.230 --> 01:22:35.063
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to do it and that it's an </v>

1829
01:22:36.521 --> 01:22:39.040
<v Speaker 3>actual belief.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I was like,</v>

1830
01:22:39.041 --> 01:22:40.810
<v Speaker 3>you're a hypocrite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I was like,</v>

1831
01:22:40.811 --> 01:22:43.990
<v Speaker 3>I'm tired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't think about it anymore.</v>

1832
01:22:44.470 --> 01:22:45.400
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1833
01:22:45.401 --> 01:22:49.540
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1834
01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:53.830
<v Speaker 3>I think what I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a hypocrite is what I'm saying.</v>

1835
01:22:53.831 --> 01:22:54.664
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you're a hypocrite,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just have you decided when they </v>

1836
01:22:56.951 --> 01:22:57.784
<v Speaker 3>knock over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just decide what you want to do and </v>

1837
01:22:59.231 --> 01:23:00.880
<v Speaker 3>what you don't want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1838
01:23:00.881 --> 01:23:02.380
<v Speaker 3>and you didn't want him to go Marsha </v>
<v Speaker 3>Day.</v>

1839
01:23:02.381 --> 01:23:05.050
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean you're a hypocrite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It means you just didn't want to do it.</v>

1840
01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:06.070
<v Speaker 3>You're a hypocrite.</v>

1841
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:09.640
<v Speaker 2>If you were saying one thing and voting </v>
<v Speaker 2>for another,</v>

1842
01:23:09.670 --> 01:23:11.680
<v Speaker 2>that would make you a hypocrite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That just makes you a person.</v>

1843
01:23:11.681 --> 01:23:15.610
<v Speaker 2>You're just just decided that's not what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wanted to do and also look,</v>

1844
01:23:15.611 --> 01:23:18.460
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be nice if you through your one</v>

1845
01:23:18.461 --> 01:23:19.294
<v Speaker 2>and two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 600,000 that were marching through </v>

1846
01:23:20.441 --> 01:23:24.130
<v Speaker 2>the streets of downtown La,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's still 600,000 people.</v>

1847
01:23:24.131 --> 01:23:25.810
<v Speaker 2>Even if she just watching it from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>news and go,</v>

1848
01:23:25.811 --> 01:23:27.590
<v Speaker 2>you go girl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

1849
01:23:27.591 --> 01:23:29.500
<v Speaker 2>you're not helping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not helping,</v>

1850
01:23:29.780 --> 01:23:31.990
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think you're a hypocrite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make you a hypocrite.</v>

1851
01:23:34.150 --> 01:23:36.640
<v Speaker 2>Does it help?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think those big marches,</v>

1852
01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:39.130
<v Speaker 2>and I'm wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it empowers people.</v>

1853
01:23:39.610 --> 01:23:41.860
<v Speaker 2>It gets people very excited about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cause.</v>

1854
01:23:41.861 --> 01:23:43.660
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of other people that think</v>
<v Speaker 2>like minded,</v>

1855
01:23:43.820 --> 01:23:45.790
<v Speaker 2>gets people to watch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets people to put it on the news.</v>

1856
01:23:45.791 --> 01:23:48.460
<v Speaker 2>People at home watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe people feel like,</v>

1857
01:23:48.461 --> 01:23:49.294
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though some fucked up things have </v>

1858
01:23:50.591 --> 01:23:53.020
<v Speaker 2>gone down with Harvey Weinstein and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>this other shit,</v>

1859
01:23:53.380 --> 01:23:54.213
<v Speaker 2>it least it's turning around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe people are bummed out that this </v>

1860
01:23:56.741 --> 01:23:59.620
<v Speaker 2>guy became the president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now people are active.</v>

1861
01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:03.130
<v Speaker 2>Maybe people are paying attention more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe people are more engaged.</v>

1862
01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:07.120
<v Speaker 2>So ultimately it's almost like we were </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about before.</v>

1863
01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:11.470
<v Speaker 2>You get past that adversity and there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually a benefit to it.</v>

1864
01:24:11.471 --> 01:24:12.304
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes I think even as a country </v>
<v Speaker 2>we might need that cause we don't have </v>

1865
01:24:14.711 --> 01:24:17.230
<v Speaker 2>any war over here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything is over there.</v>

1866
01:24:17.260 --> 01:24:20.140
<v Speaker 2>We don't see it in terms of like right </v>
<v Speaker 2>in front of us on a daily basis.</v>

1867
01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:22.810
<v Speaker 2>But this is like a cultural war and an </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea of war.</v>

1868
01:24:23.110 --> 01:24:23.943
<v Speaker 2>And so I think that these things </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening right in front of us and </v>

1869
01:24:26.471 --> 01:24:29.970
<v Speaker 2>having these uncomfortable moments </v>
<v Speaker 2>forces these conversations is just going</v>

1870
01:24:29.980 --> 01:24:30.813
<v Speaker 2>to be peaks and valleys in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation where people are rude and </v>

1871
01:24:32.711 --> 01:24:34.870
<v Speaker 2>people are calm and maybe there's going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be some breakthroughs,</v>

1872
01:24:35.050 --> 01:24:38.100
<v Speaker 2>but ultimately it at least four and </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably,</v>

1873
01:24:38.820 --> 01:24:40.750
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pro progress.</v>

1874
01:24:40.990 --> 01:24:41.823
<v Speaker 2>And I think that all of this comes from </v>
<v Speaker 2>people being disfat dissatisfied with </v>

1875
01:24:45.371 --> 01:24:48.350
<v Speaker 2>how things are currently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the best way to,</v>

1876
01:24:48.530 --> 01:24:50.620
<v Speaker 2>to add,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to very,</v>

1877
01:24:50.621 --> 01:24:51.454
<v Speaker 2>very inspiring to me that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's kids came out and our </v>

1878
01:24:54.551 --> 01:24:58.750
<v Speaker 2>talking and that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that about guns.</v>

1879
01:24:59.310 --> 01:25:04.310
<v Speaker 2>It's also sad that sa so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so little is happening.</v>

1880
01:25:04.810 --> 01:25:06.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1881
01:25:06.260 --> 01:25:07.120
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is sad,</v>

1882
01:25:07.140 --> 01:25:08.950
<v Speaker 2>but there's two things that have to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>addressed.</v>

1883
01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:09.993
<v Speaker 2>Guns have to be addressed for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also mental health has to be a </v>

1884
01:25:13.741 --> 01:25:16.180
<v Speaker 2>trust.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to address psych medicines.</v>

1885
01:25:16.181 --> 01:25:18.250
<v Speaker 2>We have to address how many of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

1886
01:25:18.340 --> 01:25:20.920
<v Speaker 2>whether it's correlation equals </v>
<v Speaker 2>causation or not.</v>

1887
01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:24.790
<v Speaker 2>How many of these fucking people have </v>
<v Speaker 2>been on psych medicine?</v>

1888
01:25:24.970 --> 01:25:27.010
<v Speaker 2>And the answer is almost all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1889
01:25:27.011 --> 01:25:27.844
<v Speaker 2>does that mean that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're mentally ill and so that's why </v>

1890
01:25:29.591 --> 01:25:32.740
<v Speaker 2>they shoot people or that doing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>psych meds,</v>

1891
01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:36.490
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people call these the effects </v>
<v Speaker 2>of these things very disassociative that</v>

1892
01:25:36.491 --> 01:25:37.324
<v Speaker 2>they allow people to do horrific things </v>
<v Speaker 2>they might not have been able to do </v>

1893
01:25:39.281 --> 01:25:42.580
<v Speaker 2>before or inspire them to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a real argument there.</v>

1894
01:25:42.790 --> 01:25:43.623
<v Speaker 2>It's not exonerating the people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>have done these horrific things or </v>

1895
01:25:45.731 --> 01:25:47.920
<v Speaker 2>exonerating the people that got the guns</v>
<v Speaker 2>in their hands,</v>

1896
01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:49.690
<v Speaker 2>it's not doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is a factor.</v>

1897
01:25:49.870 --> 01:25:52.450
<v Speaker 2>There's a fact that the people aren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>taken into consideration becomes,</v>

1898
01:25:52.451 --> 01:25:56.050
<v Speaker 2>it comes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it becomes a one or the other thing.</v>

1899
01:25:56.260 --> 01:26:01.150
<v Speaker 2>It becomes an either we need more gun </v>
<v Speaker 2>control and we need stricter gun control</v>

1900
01:26:01.180 --> 01:26:04.790
<v Speaker 2>or we need to do something about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>effects of psych medication.</v>

1901
01:26:04.970 --> 01:26:08.630
<v Speaker 2>It's not both and I think it's both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really did say,</v>

1902
01:26:08.650 --> 01:26:09.440
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1903
01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:14.440
<v Speaker 2>based on how you just presented it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it definitely seems like both and it,</v>

1904
01:26:14.750 --> 01:26:15.780
<v Speaker 2>there was an article,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>

1905
01:26:15.781 --> 01:26:16.614
<v Speaker 2>or I'm sorry to interrupt you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was an article that was </v>

1906
01:26:17.391 --> 01:26:18.440
<v Speaker 2>written,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to remember this.</v>

1907
01:26:18.650 --> 01:26:21.260
<v Speaker 2>There was written recently that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>really ridiculous and it would say,</v>

1908
01:26:21.261 --> 01:26:22.094
<v Speaker 2>and contrary to popular belief,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of these mass shooters are not </v>

1909
01:26:24.141 --> 01:26:24.974
<v Speaker 2>mentally ill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well what the fuck defines mentally ill </v>

1910
01:26:27.471 --> 01:26:28.304
<v Speaker 2>if they're on psych medication,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all on anti psychotics and </v>

1911
01:26:32.301 --> 01:26:36.730
<v Speaker 2>psychiatric meds and Ssri.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're almost all so if they not,</v>

1912
01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:37.820
<v Speaker 2>they're not mentally ill.</v>

1913
01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:42.250
<v Speaker 2>How are you shooting people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that in itself,</v>

1914
01:26:42.610 --> 01:26:43.443
<v Speaker 2>that was the next [inaudible] you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>just go and do a school and shoot 19 </v>

1915
01:26:45.621 --> 01:26:47.150
<v Speaker 2>children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to be mentally ill.</v>

1916
01:26:47.300 --> 01:26:49.880
<v Speaker 2>But the point is if they're not mentally</v>
<v Speaker 2>ill,</v>

1917
01:26:49.881 --> 01:26:52.940
<v Speaker 2>why are they taking medicine for people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who are mentally ill?</v>

1918
01:26:52.941 --> 01:26:56.390
<v Speaker 2>There's a bullshit article and it's an </v>
<v Speaker 2>article or who knows what the fucking,</v>

1919
01:26:56.510 --> 01:27:00.650
<v Speaker 2>whether it's a contrarian point of view </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's is designed to get clickbait hits</v>

1920
01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:01.753
<v Speaker 2>or whether it's someone who is trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>set up a narrative that's contrary to </v>

1921
01:27:05.361 --> 01:27:08.750
<v Speaker 2>what the pharmaceutical drugs companies </v>
<v Speaker 2>have known for years.</v>

1922
01:27:08.900 --> 01:27:11.570
<v Speaker 2>There's real effects to those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can,</v>

1923
01:27:11.571 --> 01:27:14.570
<v Speaker 2>and they're not always positive and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a God crap crapshoot.</v>

1924
01:27:14.571 --> 01:27:17.210
<v Speaker 2>Whether or not a pill's going to work </v>
<v Speaker 2>for you or not work for you.</v>

1925
01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:19.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean that that's why they have </v>
<v Speaker 2>abilify.</v>

1926
01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:21.320
<v Speaker 2>Abilify is an anti psychotic.</v>

1927
01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:22.153
<v Speaker 2>They prescribed to people who are on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're on Ssri but they think about </v>

1928
01:27:25.281 --> 01:27:26.390
<v Speaker 2>killing themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

1929
01:27:26.391 --> 01:27:27.770
<v Speaker 2>well if you're thinking about killing </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself,</v>

1930
01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:30.140
<v Speaker 2>try this first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Try to stack these two together.</v>

1931
01:27:30.260 --> 01:27:31.093
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's your mixture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Ryan wasn't it the most number one </v>

1932
01:27:33.830 --> 01:27:37.430
<v Speaker 2>most prescribed drug in the country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See if that's true.</v>

1933
01:27:37.431 --> 01:27:38.264
<v Speaker 2>Still a bill of an antipsychotic was the</v>
<v Speaker 2>number one most prescribed drug in the </v>

1934
01:27:42.651 --> 01:27:43.730
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

<v Speaker 2>of these people are taking medication </v>

1936
01:27:47.571 --> 01:27:49.550

<v Speaker 2>I'm sure if some of them,</v>

1937
01:27:49.730 --> 01:27:50.563
<v Speaker 2>how many people are taking medication </v>
<v Speaker 2>because drug companies are pushing this </v>

01:28:21.950 --> 01:28:25.150
<v Speaker 2>like when we look like mass mass </v>
<v Speaker 2>shootings is not just one.</v>

1950
01:28:25.151 --> 01:28:27.110
<v Speaker 2>If you want to take credit for the good </v>
<v Speaker 2>things and men have done,</v>

1951
01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:31.100
<v Speaker 2>you have to take credit for all the war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's also what they'd done.</v>

1952
01:28:31.190 --> 01:28:33.260
<v Speaker 2>Men have cause all of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1953
01:28:33.261 --> 01:28:36.110
<v Speaker 2>And in the bit I go into detail about </v>
<v Speaker 2>all these different things,</v>

1954
01:28:36.111 --> 01:28:37.670
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a build up to something else.</v>

1955
01:28:37.671 --> 01:28:38.504
<v Speaker 2>But this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this also has to be addressed that it's </v>

1956
01:28:41.841 --> 01:28:43.490
<v Speaker 2>always men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's real too.</v>

1957
01:28:43.810 --> 01:28:46.670
<v Speaker 2>It's not not blaming every man that </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't shoot up a school.</v>

1958
01:28:46.910 --> 01:28:48.500
<v Speaker 2>We have to figure out what the fuck is </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1959
01:28:48.710 --> 01:28:49.190
<v Speaker 2>what is it?</v>

1960
01:28:49.190 --> 01:28:50.870
<v Speaker 2>What combination of psych,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs,</v>

1961
01:28:51.020 --> 01:28:51.853
<v Speaker 2>guns and being a man is causing this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if we just want to blame only the </v>

1962
01:28:56.601 --> 01:28:59.060
<v Speaker 2>tools,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that seems to be to be fucking crazy.</v>

1963
01:28:59.270 --> 01:29:01.500
<v Speaker 2>They also want to blame the NRA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1964
01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:02.633
<v Speaker 2>I'd see him one point because you think </v>
<v Speaker 2>the NRA is helping people get drunk or </v>

1965
01:29:05.221 --> 01:29:07.500
<v Speaker 2>get guns rather more easily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get that.</v>

1966
01:29:07.650 --> 01:29:11.970
<v Speaker 2>But also no one who was a member of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>NRA has ever committed a mass shooting.</v>

1967
01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:14.010
<v Speaker 2>So you have to think of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1968
01:29:14.011 --> 01:29:15.720
<v Speaker 2>well what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1969
01:29:15.721 --> 01:29:16.554
<v Speaker 2>are you really blaming the group of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that want gun safety to be </v>

1970
01:29:19.351 --> 01:29:20.184
<v Speaker 2>paramount and the group of people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't want their rights to be </v>

1971
01:29:22.681 --> 01:29:23.514
<v Speaker 2>infringed?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or are you going to attack the group of </v>

1972
01:29:25.441 --> 01:29:26.940
<v Speaker 2>people that are actually shooting these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people?</v>

1973
01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:29.370
<v Speaker 2>That's the real problem is that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that have actually done it,</v>

1974
01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:33.560
<v Speaker 2>and I guarantee you there's something </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong with every single for that.</v>

1975
01:29:33.670 --> 01:29:34.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're right about now.</v>

1976
01:29:35.990 --> 01:29:37.150
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1977
01:29:37.160 --> 01:29:39.730
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no it because everything you're saying,</v>

1978
01:29:39.731 --> 01:29:44.731
<v Speaker 3>I'm just thinking that the person that </v>
<v Speaker 3>shoots a bunch of people,</v>

1979
01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:49.240
<v Speaker 3>whether they're on psych drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether they have access to a gun,</v>

1980
01:29:50.470 --> 01:29:55.470
<v Speaker 3>mental health issues there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're isolated to the point where they</v>

1981
01:29:56.261 --> 01:29:57.550
<v Speaker 3>can do something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1982
01:29:57.610 --> 01:30:02.610
<v Speaker 3>And that quiet little statement that </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone is isolated is something that we</v>

1983
01:30:05.171 --> 01:30:08.740
<v Speaker 3>can't address because it's so </v>
<v Speaker 3>complicated.</v>

1984
01:30:08.741 --> 01:30:12.280
<v Speaker 3>And it's such the fabric of how we live </v>
<v Speaker 3>our lives.</v>

1985
01:30:12.580 --> 01:30:16.060
<v Speaker 3>It's so much easier to like blame and </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight for all these things,</v>

1986
01:30:16.061 --> 01:30:21.061
<v Speaker 3>but how do we fix,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know the one guy who his brother was</v>

1987
01:30:22.001 --> 01:30:23.770
<v Speaker 3>just found with all that porn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1988
01:30:24.100 --> 01:30:24.933
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy that shot all the people in </v>

1989
01:30:26.351 --> 01:30:27.370
<v Speaker 3>Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1990
01:30:27.820 --> 01:30:28.653
<v Speaker 3>How do we address just how fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 3>people are in general or the contraband </v>

1991
01:30:33.350 --> 01:30:37.150
<v Speaker 3>story about I'm jumping topics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the horrible story about that,</v>

1992
01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:38.833
<v Speaker 3>can't even talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The couple that had all those kids that </v>

1993
01:30:43.151 --> 01:30:48.151
<v Speaker 3>they open their basement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody knew.</v>

1994
01:30:48.970 --> 01:30:50.950
<v Speaker 3>Nobody said anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People.</v>

1995
01:30:50.951 --> 01:30:52.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought they seemed weird,</v>

1996
01:30:52.301 --> 01:30:53.134
<v Speaker 3>like how do we address our disconnection</v>
<v Speaker 3>from each other that we that were so </v>

1997
01:31:01.061 --> 01:31:01.880
<v Speaker 3>fun.</v>

1998
01:31:01.880 --> 01:31:02.713
<v Speaker 2>There is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're definitely going to be people </v>

1999
01:31:04.221 --> 01:31:06.260
<v Speaker 2>that feel alienated and they always want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

2000
01:31:06.520 --> 01:31:07.353
<v Speaker 2>they see these people having a good time</v>
<v Speaker 2>around them and they want to just flip </v>

2001
01:31:09.771 --> 01:31:10.604
<v Speaker 2>over the game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to say fuck you and burn the </v>

2002
01:31:12.321 --> 01:31:13.154
<v Speaker 2>whole thing to the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's always going to be people like </v>

2003
01:31:14.181 --> 01:31:15.014
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of that that you can see </v>

2004
01:31:17.211 --> 01:31:19.790
<v Speaker 2>people having a good time around and see</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are happy that,</v>

2005
01:31:19.791 --> 01:31:20.624
<v Speaker 2>that are enjoying life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like especially if this kid felt </v>

2006
01:31:23.151 --> 01:31:23.984
<v Speaker 2>alienated in school and bullied and cast</v>
<v Speaker 2>out and targeted and then he gets free </v>

2007
01:31:29.181 --> 01:31:30.830
<v Speaker 2>and he sees these people that are having</v>
<v Speaker 2>fun.</v>

2008
01:31:30.831 --> 01:31:33.050
<v Speaker 2>He just wants to go back and just punish</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone.</v>

2009
01:31:33.290 --> 01:31:35.480
<v Speaker 2>This is a very common theme,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2010
01:31:35.481 --> 01:31:38.630
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do we pain that theme?</v>

2011
01:31:38.631 --> 01:31:39.464
<v Speaker 2>How do we help people who are in pain?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are going to have to do a lot of </v>

2012
01:31:42.351 --> 01:31:42.890
<v Speaker 2>things right?</v>

2013
01:31:42.890 --> 01:31:44.840
<v Speaker 2>Because like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think of the people that uh,</v>

2014
01:31:44.930 --> 01:31:45.763
<v Speaker 2>had their children locked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who are these monsters and how'd they </v>

2015
01:31:48.471 --> 01:31:51.140
<v Speaker 2>have a kid?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How was it so hard to get a car license?</v>

2016
01:31:51.141 --> 01:31:51.974
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's easy as fuck to have a kid and </v>

2017
01:31:53.271 --> 01:31:56.510
<v Speaker 2>raise another member of our culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of our society,</v>

2018
01:31:56.520 --> 01:31:58.160
<v Speaker 2>our community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How's that possible?</v>

2019
01:31:58.161 --> 01:31:58.994
<v Speaker 2>You've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've introduced a poison and toxic </v>

2020
01:32:00.551 --> 01:32:03.160
<v Speaker 2>member to our community cause you did a </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible job of raising them.</v>

2021
01:32:03.220 --> 01:32:07.150
<v Speaker 2>And one of the oldest ones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to college and then they would,</v>

2022
01:32:07.390 --> 01:32:10.210
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a dude would come out and</v>

2023
01:32:10.211 --> 01:32:11.950
<v Speaker 2>the mom would be waiting for him and </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2024
01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:18.360
<v Speaker 2>so the oldest one was out in the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>and still no one could help.</v>

2025
01:32:19.211 --> 01:32:22.340
<v Speaker 2>Like whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mind mallards they had,</v>

2026
01:32:22.341 --> 01:32:23.174
<v Speaker 2>this one was out and he didn't say that </v>
<v Speaker 2>his younger brothers and sisters were </v>

2027
01:32:26.081 --> 01:32:28.030
<v Speaker 2>locked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had gas.</v>

2028
01:32:28.050 --> 01:32:30.490
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he should be in jail.</v>

2029
01:32:30.940 --> 01:32:32.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the whole,</v>

2030
01:32:32.980 --> 01:32:34.510
<v Speaker 2>the details of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

2031
01:32:35.240 --> 01:32:37.210
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's not his fault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's probably what?</v>

2032
01:32:37.300 --> 01:32:38.133
<v Speaker 2>Beyond fucked in the head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just the fact that he could keep </v>

2033
01:32:40.271 --> 01:32:41.650
<v Speaker 2>that a secret.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like what?</v>

2034
01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:46.250
<v Speaker 2>It's horrific and you and you just think</v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

2035
01:32:46.820 --> 01:32:47.653
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many people are fucked by the time </v>

2036
01:32:50.391 --> 01:32:51.224
<v Speaker 2>they have children?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's not even that they're doing a </v>

2037
01:32:53.331 --> 01:32:56.300
<v Speaker 2>bad job of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're incapable of doing a good job of</v>

2038
01:32:56.301 --> 01:33:00.020
<v Speaker 2>it there too fucked up there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>too fucked up from their own upbringing.</v>

2039
01:33:00.050 --> 01:33:02.220
<v Speaker 2>But they still get horny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2040
01:33:02.320 --> 01:33:04.910
<v Speaker 2>does this as is what happens in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>world?</v>

2041
01:33:05.420 --> 01:33:07.730
<v Speaker 2>People like to have sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have saks boone,</v>

2042
01:33:07.731 --> 01:33:10.520

<v Speaker 2>but I'm fucked up and I love math.</v>

2043

<v Speaker 2>What do you do in men?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mra?</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's definitely men though and that's,</v>

2046
01:33:19.010 --> 01:33:19.843
<v Speaker 2>that's my issue with all this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A masculine bullshit is a lot of these </v>

2047
01:33:24.051 --> 01:33:29.051
<v Speaker 2>guys that are proclaiming masculinity or</v>
<v Speaker 2>really bitches and that the,</v>

01:33:30.470 --> 01:33:33.920
<v Speaker 2>that real men wouldn't be doing this </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff in the first place.</v>

2049
01:33:34.390 --> 01:33:37.340
<v Speaker 2>You would look past most of this stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the first place.</v>

2050
01:33:39.690 --> 01:33:40.523
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2051
01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:45.040
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people in this world </v>
<v Speaker 2>that don't have personal sovereignty,</v>

2052
01:33:45.190 --> 01:33:47.410
<v Speaker 2>whether it's men or women and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

2053
01:33:47.470 --> 01:33:48.303
<v Speaker 2>they're not raised correctly and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't go on a beneficial path </v>

2054
01:33:51.611 --> 01:33:54.070
<v Speaker 2>through life that left them in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>current state,</v>

2055
01:33:54.370 --> 01:33:58.420
<v Speaker 2>whether they're a helpful member of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>

2056
01:33:58.710 --> 01:34:01.810
<v Speaker 2>That's the show about family values.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what you're really about.</v>

2057
01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:04.160
<v Speaker 2>It is about community values,</v>
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

2058
01:34:04.170 --> 01:34:05.003
<v Speaker 2>friendship.</v>

<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the comedy store,</v>

2060
01:34:07.060 --> 01:34:07.893
<v Speaker 2>friendships giant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very important and some people </v>

2061
01:34:10.121 --> 01:34:13.360
<v Speaker 2>don't have any fucking friends and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a dark place to be bullied.</v>

2062
01:34:13.361 --> 01:34:14.920
<v Speaker 2>You're whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't have any friends.</v>

2063
01:34:14.921 --> 01:34:15.754
<v Speaker 2>You're on medication,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're all fucked up and you're one of </v>

2064
01:34:17.861 --> 01:34:20.170
<v Speaker 2>those guys out there that just wants to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go out with a bang,</v>

2065
01:34:20.620 --> 01:34:21.453
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just want to walk into a mall with a </v>

2066
01:34:22.181 --> 01:34:23.770
<v Speaker 2>fucking shotgun and go out with a bang.</v>

2067
01:34:23.800 --> 01:34:25.420
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people that think like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2068
01:34:25.421 --> 01:34:26.860
<v Speaker 2>They just don't have the courage to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2069
01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:27.993
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even going back to that one night that </v>

2070
01:34:28.781 --> 01:34:30.880
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I said I don't know if I can do it,</v>

2071
01:34:30.910 --> 01:34:33.130
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a smaller example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2072
01:34:33.670 --> 01:34:36.940
<v Speaker 2>but still valid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2073
01:34:36.941 --> 01:34:39.910
<v Speaker 2>and you just looked at me and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can your guide,</v>

2074
01:34:39.911 --> 01:34:40.744
<v Speaker 2>like you're doing it or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever you're responsible as those </v>

2075
01:34:43.451 --> 01:34:46.240
<v Speaker 2>little moments of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are big,</v>

2076
01:34:46.460 --> 01:34:48.100
<v Speaker 2>a real connection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2077
01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:49.113
<v Speaker 2>When you know someone really does care </v>
<v Speaker 2>about you and someone who really does </v>

2078
01:34:51.221 --> 01:34:52.930
<v Speaker 2>like you and we're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2079
01:34:53.320 --> 01:34:58.320
<v Speaker 2>talking every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just a moment of and commonality</v>

2080
01:34:58.550 --> 01:35:01.610
<v Speaker 3>and seeing that other person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we fixed it,</v>

2081
01:35:01.611 --> 01:35:03.830
<v Speaker 3>everybody and we fixed it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We did it well.</v>

2082
01:35:03.831 --> 01:35:04.664
<v Speaker 3>I never had</v>

2083
01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:07.670
<v Speaker 2>never knew that you didn't think well of</v>
<v Speaker 2>me or,</v>

2084
01:35:07.790 --> 01:35:09.720
<v Speaker 2>or I did.</v>

2085
01:35:09.950 --> 01:35:10.783
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never felt like he didn't like him </v>

2086
01:35:11.960 --> 01:35:15.320
<v Speaker 3>sedated by you and I didn't I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I didn't know you,</v>

2087
01:35:15.321 --> 01:35:17.300
<v Speaker 3>but I just like your vibe to me was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2088
01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:20.660
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he doesn't like me very much.</v>

2089
01:35:22.340 --> 01:35:24.830
<v Speaker 3>But that wasn't because of anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago though,</v>

2090
01:35:24.831 --> 01:35:28.970
<v Speaker 3>this is probably would have been 2000 </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

2091
01:35:28.971 --> 01:35:29.804
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2092
01:35:29.810 --> 01:35:33.080
<v Speaker 3>But it was never anything where like I </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't like you.</v>

2093
01:35:33.140 --> 01:35:38.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure I probably was not even really </v>
<v Speaker 3>on your radar or not even a thing.</v>

2094
01:35:38.691 --> 01:35:39.524
<v Speaker 3>I'm not liking or liking that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know we never really had any </v>

2095
01:35:42.771 --> 01:35:43.940
<v Speaker 3>interactions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2096
01:35:43.941 --> 01:35:46.580
<v Speaker 3>I just felt your power took it first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Personally.</v>

2097
01:35:47.350 --> 01:35:48.320
<v Speaker 3>I felt your power.</v>

2098
01:35:49.880 --> 01:35:53.030
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty silly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well we got through that too.</v>

2099
01:35:53.480 --> 01:35:54.313
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we did.</v>

2100
01:35:56.450 --> 01:35:58.250
<v Speaker 2>So if you do a special,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2101
01:35:58.280 --> 01:35:59.720
<v Speaker 2>When you think you'd be gearing up for </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2102
01:36:00.620 --> 01:36:02.840
<v Speaker 2>have you thought through it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like to be ready in a year?</v>

2103
01:36:02.980 --> 01:36:05.480
<v Speaker 2>We were ready in a month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my gosh.</v>

2104
01:36:05.750 --> 01:36:06.583
<v Speaker 2>Too much.</v>

2105
01:36:06.660 --> 01:36:07.710
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was the bed.</v>

2106
01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:11.270
<v Speaker 3>Or has that been mad?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2107
01:36:11.280 --> 01:36:12.113
<v Speaker 3>nap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nap.</v>

2108
01:36:13.080 --> 01:36:13.913
<v Speaker 3>I have to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause so many comics I know do it </v>

2109
01:36:17.281 --> 01:36:18.690
<v Speaker 3>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2110
01:36:20.350 --> 01:36:25.350
<v Speaker 3>I think I could have the material I want</v>
<v Speaker 3>fairly like within the next six months,</v>

2111
01:36:26.891 --> 01:36:31.210
<v Speaker 3>but then I need to figure out the how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2112
01:36:31.211 --> 01:36:31.870
<v Speaker 3>how</v>

2113
01:36:31.870 --> 01:36:32.650
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how.</v>

2114
01:36:32.650 --> 01:36:35.350
<v Speaker 2>There's a few companies that do you need</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make,</v>

2115
01:36:35.440 --> 01:36:37.540
<v Speaker 2>I need to make it first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2116
01:36:37.570 --> 01:36:38.980
<v Speaker 2>That's how you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2117
01:36:39.010 --> 01:36:41.050
<v Speaker 2>Just make it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2118
01:36:41.110 --> 01:36:41.943
<v Speaker 2>that's not a bad move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The just making it first is not a bad </v>

2119
01:36:44.351 --> 01:36:45.880
<v Speaker 2>mood because when you just make it </v>
<v Speaker 2>first,</v>

2120
01:36:46.180 --> 01:36:48.730
<v Speaker 2>then you could just sort of sell it </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere.</v>

2121
01:36:48.790 --> 01:36:49.623
<v Speaker 2>And if it's good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody is always looking for new </v>

2122
01:36:51.131 --> 01:36:52.510
<v Speaker 2>comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2123
01:36:52.570 --> 01:36:53.403
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were just talking earlier about the </v>

2124
01:36:54.231 --> 01:36:55.160
<v Speaker 2>Amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard a</v>

2125
01:36:55.160 --> 01:36:55.993
<v Speaker 3>little bit of scare because I had teed </v>
<v Speaker 3>up for it when I first went on the road </v>

2126
01:36:58.701 --> 01:37:00.560
<v Speaker 3>and had had an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

2127
01:37:00.650 --> 01:37:02.780
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my manager at the time,</v>

2128
01:37:03.500 --> 01:37:05.570
<v Speaker 3>I think tried to sell it on a high </v>
<v Speaker 3>level.</v>

2129
01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:08.630
<v Speaker 3>This was before Netflix is what it is </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

2130
01:37:08.631 --> 01:37:13.010
<v Speaker 3>It was a few years back when they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>first started doing hours,</v>

2131
01:37:13.011 --> 01:37:14.870
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2132
01:37:15.950 --> 01:37:16.910
<v Speaker 3>and they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2133
01:37:16.940 --> 01:37:17.773
<v Speaker 3>And then she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2134
01:37:17.870 --> 01:37:19.700
<v Speaker 3>all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the top tier people were like,</v>

2135
01:37:19.790 --> 01:37:20.571
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2136
01:37:20.571 --> 01:37:22.550
<v Speaker 3>no one knows her as a comic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we're not buying it.</v>

2137
01:37:22.551 --> 01:37:25.310
<v Speaker 3>And then she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me sell it at the second tier.</v>

2138
01:37:25.311 --> 01:37:26.210
<v Speaker 3>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2139
01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:29.480
<v Speaker 3>And then this whole time I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should have just done it myself.</v>

2140
01:37:29.510 --> 01:37:34.510
<v Speaker 3>But I think I've been lucky enough to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have get a lot of acting jobs.</v>

2141
01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:39.860
<v Speaker 3>So whenever I'm like being myself </v>
<v Speaker 3>starter and then a carrot comes along,</v>

2142
01:37:39.861 --> 01:37:40.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2143
01:37:40.260 --> 01:37:41.630
<v Speaker 3>do that acting job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That'll work.</v>

2144
01:37:41.631 --> 01:37:42.464
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I've never had to sort of grind it </v>

2145
01:37:45.111 --> 01:37:47.360
<v Speaker 3>out in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's why it scares me.</v>

2146
01:37:47.361 --> 01:37:48.194
<v Speaker 3>So then at the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it didn't sell at that time I just </v>

2147
01:37:50.091 --> 01:37:50.990
<v Speaker 3>went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2148
01:37:50.991 --> 01:37:53.780
<v Speaker 3>I should have done that myself and now </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm tired of this material.</v>

2149
01:37:53.781 --> 01:37:54.770
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2150
01:37:54.771 --> 01:37:55.710
<v Speaker 3>time passes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2151
01:37:55.711 --> 01:37:56.010
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's</v>

2152
01:37:56.010 --> 01:38:00.060
<v Speaker 2>for the best because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once I do that,</v>

2153
01:38:00.090 --> 01:38:00.923
<v Speaker 2>then I'm really out there as that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be a commitment issue on my </v>

2154
01:38:04.171 --> 01:38:06.000
<v Speaker 2>part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that film.</v>

2155
01:38:06.060 --> 01:38:07.230
<v Speaker 2>I know what you mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just hard.</v>

2156
01:38:07.231 --> 01:38:09.850
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to just fucking dig your heels</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

2157
01:38:09.870 --> 01:38:11.850
<v Speaker 2>decide to do something that's tough like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2158
01:38:11.851 --> 01:38:15.180
<v Speaker 2>And then also the financial investment </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you decide to do it yourself.</v>

2159
01:38:15.290 --> 01:38:16.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you got to spend a lot of money and</v>

2160
01:38:16.891 --> 01:38:17.724
<v Speaker 2>hire crude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make sure the director doesn't fuck it </v>

2161
01:38:18.901 --> 01:38:19.734
<v Speaker 2>up and make sure it all comes out well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know who do I know the did one and </v>

2162
01:38:25.201 --> 01:38:28.590
<v Speaker 2>they fucked up the shooting of it and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>had a wind up putting it online.</v>

2163
01:38:28.591 --> 01:38:29.424
<v Speaker 2>Was it rory Albany's did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said that he did one that someone </v>

2164
01:38:32.281 --> 01:38:36.690

<v Speaker 2>online or he hasn't released his,</v>

2165
01:38:36.700 --> 01:38:37.533
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was thinking about doing it soon </v>

2166
01:38:38.340 --> 01:38:43.010
<v Speaker 2>sound my throws him somebody else then </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kurt Metzger.</v>

2167
01:38:43.930 --> 01:38:44.320
<v Speaker 4>Hm.</v>

2168
01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:45.153
<v Speaker 2>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2169
01:38:45.400 --> 01:38:48.160
<v Speaker 2>someone funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you do yours yourself?</v>

2170
01:38:48.280 --> 01:38:50.740
<v Speaker 2>I did one of them myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2171
01:38:51.030 --> 01:38:53.170
<v Speaker 2>I've done two of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two of them myself.</v>

2172
01:38:53.290 --> 01:38:54.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2173
01:38:54.940 --> 01:38:59.050
<v Speaker 2>but the best was last year doing it with</v>
<v Speaker 2>Netflix.</v>

2174
01:38:59.350 --> 01:39:01.390
<v Speaker 2>That was the best because they're just </v>
<v Speaker 2>so easy.</v>

2175
01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:02.680
<v Speaker 2>They just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go ahead.</v>

2176
01:39:02.770 --> 01:39:04.570
<v Speaker 2>They used to let you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>we like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yay.</v>

2178
01:39:05.980 --> 01:39:08.410
<v Speaker 2>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was zero feedback,</v>

2179
01:39:08.710 --> 01:39:09.543
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just wanted to make sure it was an </v>

2180
01:39:10.870 --> 01:39:11.830
<v Speaker 2>hour long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not too long.</v>

2181
01:39:11.831 --> 01:39:14.860
<v Speaker 2>Not too short.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of want to do a 15 minute special</v>

2182
01:39:14.940 --> 01:39:15.773
<v Speaker 2>cause I have this thing that I've done </v>
<v Speaker 2>for years and I don't do it every very </v>

2183
01:39:18.461 --> 01:39:20.620
<v Speaker 2>often,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a in a throw down.</v>

2184
01:39:20.650 --> 01:39:22.690
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>But like 15 minutes like bitches and </v>

2189
01:39:33.371 --> 01:39:34.390
<v Speaker 2>they're scented candles.</v>

2190
01:39:34.390 --> 01:39:35.890
<v Speaker 2>They're always like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>15 minutes.</v>

2195
01:39:48.521 --> 01:39:49.630
<v Speaker 2>So that's just something they're doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

2196
01:39:50.110 --> 01:39:51.310
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I heard.</v>

2197
01:39:51.370 --> 01:39:52.203
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2198
01:39:52.360 --> 01:39:53.193
<v Speaker 2>I'd love to do an hour for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's more of a commitment to </v>

2199
01:39:56.860 --> 01:40:00.170
<v Speaker 2>things and ideas that you wanted to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>some girth to.</v>

2200
01:40:01.210 --> 01:40:02.080
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could definitely do it,</v>

2201
01:40:02.081 --> 01:40:04.990
<v Speaker 2>but we were also talking about how </v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazon's doing specials now too.</v>

2202
01:40:05.440 --> 01:40:06.273
<v Speaker 2>They did Bob Saget special and they ere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they bought a bunch of other people </v>

2203
01:40:08.931 --> 01:40:11.080
<v Speaker 2>specials that they bought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brian counts special,</v>

2204
01:40:11.380 --> 01:40:12.213
<v Speaker 2>they bought all those specialists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so all those specials are now on </v>

2205
01:40:14.381 --> 01:40:15.214
<v Speaker 2>Amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of places for you that's pretty </v>

2206
01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:21.100
<v Speaker 2>swollen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just do it is what you're saying.</v>

2207
01:40:21.101 --> 01:40:22.150
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2208
01:40:22.151 --> 01:40:25.270
<v Speaker 2>The only terrifying thing is once you do</v>
<v Speaker 2>it then you have to write new material.</v>

2209
01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:27.790
<v Speaker 2>That's where it gets scary because then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing,</v>

2210
01:40:27.791 --> 01:40:28.624
<v Speaker 2>you're left without weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He started from scratch and you've got </v>

2211
01:40:31.601 --> 01:40:32.434
<v Speaker 2>to grind and dig,</v>
<v Speaker 2>claw your way back up to the top of the </v>

2212
01:40:36.161 --> 01:40:36.850
<v Speaker 2>hill.</v>

2213
01:40:36.850 --> 01:40:39.080
<v Speaker 4>Oh okay.</v>

2214
01:40:40.210 --> 01:40:41.200
<v Speaker 2>He never done that before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

2215
01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:42.353
<v Speaker 2>Especial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most special when you have to abandon </v>

2216
01:40:43.841 --> 01:40:45.160
<v Speaker 2>all the materials and start from </v>
<v Speaker 2>scratch.</v>

2217
01:40:45.161 --> 01:40:46.870
<v Speaker 2>Now as you were saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking,</v>

2218
01:40:46.871 --> 01:40:47.704
<v Speaker 2>cause I've done one woman shows I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>done but I'm still pulling from like </v>

2219
01:40:51.941 --> 01:40:53.770
<v Speaker 2>that show cause it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2220
01:40:53.771 --> 01:40:53.980
<v Speaker 2>if it's</v>

2221
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:57.790
<v Speaker 1>stuff that I still like I'll pull it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have stuff about,</v>

2222
01:40:57.791 --> 01:40:58.624
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my son being an infant and he's nine </v>

2223
01:40:59.951 --> 01:41:00.784
<v Speaker 1>years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still talking about my csection if </v>

2224
01:41:04.691 --> 01:41:05.524
<v Speaker 1>it's late at the comedy store,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like let's get into it cause I know </v>

2225
01:41:08.441 --> 01:41:10.040
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like let me,</v>

2226
01:41:10.090 --> 01:41:10.923
<v Speaker 1>let's talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's 1:00 AM with second with a c </v>

2227
01:41:13.361 --> 01:41:16.450
<v Speaker 1>section.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are strength training.</v>

2228
01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:19.990
<v Speaker 1>That's like running with weights on like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a weight vest,</v>

2229
01:41:20.020 --> 01:41:22.870
<v Speaker 1>weights on your back and like a ankle </v>
<v Speaker 1>weights too.</v>

2230
01:41:23.050 --> 01:41:23.883
<v Speaker 1>I've learned to really love him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It took me so long to just even leave </v>

2231
01:41:26.561 --> 01:41:27.850
<v Speaker 1>the house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

2232
01:41:27.910 --> 01:41:29.980
<v Speaker 1>I would be standing there at the comedy </v>
<v Speaker 1>store.</v>

2233
01:41:29.981 --> 01:41:34.981
<v Speaker 1>Like I had to train myself to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2234
01:41:35.620 --> 01:41:37.720
<v Speaker 1>this is part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be awake,</v>

2235
01:41:37.750 --> 01:41:39.740
<v Speaker 1>you have to want to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2236
01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:40.833
<v Speaker 1>It was a weird psychological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I'm part of me is like just want </v>

2237
01:41:44.231 --> 01:41:47.950
<v Speaker 1>to do my set,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then I'm like resenting that I'm out</v>

2238
01:41:47.951 --> 01:41:48.730
<v Speaker 1>of the house.</v>

2239
01:41:48.730 --> 01:41:51.130
<v Speaker 1>Like I come some sort of princess or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

2240
01:41:51.131 --> 01:41:53.380
<v Speaker 1>How dare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2241
01:41:53.670 --> 01:41:55.000
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you made this choice.</v>

2242
01:41:55.030 --> 01:41:58.300
<v Speaker 1>You want it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But connecting the want with what it is.</v>

2243
01:41:58.540 --> 01:41:59.373
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've talked to other people who </v>

2244
01:42:00.041 --> 01:42:01.210
<v Speaker 1>are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2245
01:42:01.640 --> 01:42:03.580
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well don't do midnight shows,</v>

2246
01:42:03.581 --> 01:42:04.130
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

2247
01:42:04.130 --> 01:42:04.963
<v Speaker 1>but clearly I wanted it and I wanted it </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the comedy store and once I got used </v>

2248
01:42:09.371 --> 01:42:10.204
<v Speaker 1>to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2249
01:42:10.210 --> 01:42:11.440
<v Speaker 1>this is the best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2250
01:42:12.520 --> 01:42:13.353
<v Speaker 1>I love doing those late spots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that I wouldn't mind an 8:00 PM </v>

2251
01:42:16.961 --> 01:42:18.290
<v Speaker 1>shot,</v>

2252
01:42:19.490 --> 01:42:21.290
<v Speaker 1>shot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shot,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I didn't even get halfway through.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm taking it easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then you were about 135 milligrams </v>

<v Speaker 1>It's not bad.</v>

2257
01:42:36.671 --> 01:42:37.510
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's really good.</v>

2258

<v Speaker 1>improvement through comedy.</v>

<v Speaker 3>once I got there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was delightful.</v>

2346
01:46:08.330 --> 01:46:08.781
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>This isn't the life in my head.</v>

2348
01:46:11.770 --> 01:46:14.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a delight.</v>

2349
01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:15.633
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had to call my friend afterwards and </v>

<v Speaker 3>I think I just experienced pleasure.</v>

2351
01:46:21.530 --> 01:46:23.360
<v Speaker 3>I hate to say this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that was</v>

2352
01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:25.420
<v Speaker 2>shareable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 2>that room in particular that that set </v>
<v Speaker 2>for people don't stand up on the spot.</v>

2354
01:46:29.311 --> 01:46:30.144
<v Speaker 2>As Jeremiah Watkins show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he used to have a show called </v>

2355
01:46:31.801 --> 01:46:33.860
<v Speaker 2>Thunderpussy I guess.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the same show,</v>

2357
01:46:35.100 --> 01:46:36.840
<v Speaker 2>but they called it thunderpussy for some</v>
<v Speaker 2>reason.</v>

2358
01:46:37.050 --> 01:46:37.770
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2359
01:46:37.770 --> 01:46:41.080
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you do is you go on stage and uh,</v>

2360
01:46:41.190 --> 01:46:44.790
<v Speaker 2>people just have suggestions like I met,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I make people put their hands up,</v>

2361
01:46:44.791 --> 01:46:49.260
<v Speaker 2>I point to someone and then they give </v>
<v Speaker 2>you a suggestion and right away you just</v>

2362
01:46:49.261 --> 01:46:54.261
<v Speaker 2>start talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I have some real potential leads for</v>

2363
01:46:54.481 --> 01:46:57.750
<v Speaker 2>bits from last night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like two solid ones where I,</v>

2364
01:46:58.110 --> 01:47:01.230
<v Speaker 2>what I do is I don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do when I get home,</v>

2365
01:47:01.231 --> 01:47:03.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking tired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had a long day,</v>

2366
01:47:03.240 --> 01:47:05.790
<v Speaker 2>but it's still sit in front of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>computer and I play the recordings and I</v>

2367
01:47:05.791 --> 01:47:08.880
<v Speaker 2>go back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to have to,</v>

2368
01:47:08.881 --> 01:47:09.690
<v Speaker 2>it's part of the job.</v>

2369
01:47:09.690 --> 01:47:12.820
<v Speaker 2>Have to clean your room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like those things like got to brush</v>

2370
01:47:12.821 --> 01:47:13.654
<v Speaker 2>your teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want him to go to sleep </v>

2371
01:47:14.340 --> 01:47:15.930
<v Speaker 2>pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking teeth got to do it.</v>

2372
01:47:16.230 --> 01:47:17.063
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm sure this is fairly normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many sets I have in my phone that </v>

2373
01:47:20.881 --> 01:47:22.920
<v Speaker 2>I've never listened to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2374
01:47:22.921 --> 01:47:24.350
<v Speaker 2>it's really normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2375
01:47:24.940 --> 01:47:27.510
<v Speaker 2>I listened to the mall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to,</v>

2376
01:47:28.170 --> 01:47:29.003
<v Speaker 2>that's the only time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't listen to the malls when I'm on </v>

2377
01:47:29.851 --> 01:47:31.030
<v Speaker 2>the road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing four sets.</v>

2378
01:47:31.170 --> 01:47:32.860
<v Speaker 2>Erase it after.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2379
01:47:33.170 --> 01:47:34.530
<v Speaker 2>you save it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll show you.</v>

2380
01:47:35.210 --> 01:47:36.043
<v Speaker 2>I got all these bitches in here and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've listened to all of them and they </v>

2381
01:47:40.231 --> 01:47:41.400
<v Speaker 2>stay there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at them all.</v>

2382
01:47:41.490 --> 01:47:44.310
<v Speaker 2>How do you know which one to go back to </v>
<v Speaker 2>for stuff?</v>

2383
01:47:44.390 --> 01:47:47.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't really mark them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I edit the name.</v>

2384
01:47:47.321 --> 01:47:48.780
<v Speaker 2>See at the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>

2385
01:47:48.880 --> 01:47:49.713
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then you won't know how do you </v>

2386
01:47:51.571 --> 01:47:53.970
<v Speaker 2>remember which bit in this one?</v>

2387
01:47:53.970 --> 01:47:56.820
<v Speaker 2>You just kind of just record it and I go</v>
<v Speaker 2>over it with a notebook.</v>

2388
01:47:56.850 --> 01:48:00.510
<v Speaker 2>But the thing with me as the big thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

2389
01:48:00.750 --> 01:48:03.510
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know when something happened,</v>

2390
01:48:03.570 --> 01:48:04.403
<v Speaker 2>like if I do a sat and I'm like okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went on a totally different chain of </v>

2391
01:48:07.471 --> 01:48:08.580
<v Speaker 2>thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2392
01:48:08.940 --> 01:48:12.330
<v Speaker 2>And this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if this branch of the bit might be a new</v>

2393
01:48:12.331 --> 01:48:13.680
<v Speaker 2>bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to listen to that bit again.</v>

2394
01:48:14.060 --> 01:48:18.250
<v Speaker 2>And so I'll clearly go over there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>make sure that your common sense,</v>

2395
01:48:18.300 --> 01:48:20.780
<v Speaker 2>but it's so hard to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2396
01:48:20.790 --> 01:48:23.070
<v Speaker 2>You're giving me the training right now </v>
<v Speaker 2>of this stuff that's like,</v>

2397
01:48:23.160 --> 01:48:25.860
<v Speaker 2>obviously you remember when you went off</v>
<v Speaker 2>on that thing,</v>

2398
01:48:25.861 --> 01:48:27.900
<v Speaker 2>go back and listen to it and write it </v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

2399
01:48:27.990 --> 01:48:30.480
<v Speaker 2>Think about the things that you've said </v>
<v Speaker 2>today that have helped you,</v>

2400
01:48:30.481 --> 01:48:33.180
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how you've had to speak clearly,</v>

2401
01:48:33.210 --> 01:48:34.920
<v Speaker 2>do all these things and what did that </v>
<v Speaker 2>come from?</v>

2402
01:48:34.920 --> 01:48:35.753
<v Speaker 2>Well that come from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that comes from trial and error and </v>

2403
01:48:37.051 --> 01:48:39.900
<v Speaker 2>focus like you're focusing on your act </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of that.</v>

2404
01:48:40.440 --> 01:48:41.273
<v Speaker 2>That next level of focusing on your act </v>
<v Speaker 2>is being like super diligent about </v>

2405
01:48:45.361 --> 01:48:48.560
<v Speaker 2>recordings and writing and that's what a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of comics don't do it.</v>

2406
01:48:48.561 --> 01:48:49.394
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of comics that think </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're grinding and they'll say that </v>

2407
01:48:51.721 --> 01:48:52.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing a lot of sets.</v>

2408
01:48:53.130 --> 01:48:54.540
<v Speaker 2>They're not writing any new material </v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

2409
01:48:55.020 --> 01:48:56.520
<v Speaker 2>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to write.</v>

2410
01:48:56.670 --> 01:48:58.890
<v Speaker 2>You have to actually write.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I believe.</v>

2411
01:48:59.220 --> 01:49:00.053
<v Speaker 2>Maybe maybe you can just write all on </v>
<v Speaker 2>stage because you can trick yourself </v>

2412
01:49:02.791 --> 01:49:03.624
<v Speaker 2>into thinking that you're grinding it </v>
<v Speaker 2>out and maybe you are doing a lot of </v>

2413
01:49:05.461 --> 01:49:06.294
<v Speaker 2>sets and maybe doing the same set.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're doing it differently so you can </v>

2414
01:49:10.860 --> 01:49:12.630
<v Speaker 2>and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fine.</v>

2415
01:49:12.660 --> 01:49:15.720
<v Speaker 2>That's its own thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you're not going to come up with new</v>

2416
01:49:15.721 --> 01:49:16.320
<v Speaker 2>staff from that.</v>

2417
01:49:16.320 --> 01:49:17.153
<v Speaker 2>You're doing something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but are you doing like everything you </v>

2418
01:49:20.011 --> 01:49:22.440
<v Speaker 2>could be doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's like anything else.</v>

2419
01:49:22.470 --> 01:49:25.890
<v Speaker 2>The more time and enthusiasm you put on </v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

2420
01:49:26.160 --> 01:49:26.993
<v Speaker 2>the better you're going to get at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're a guy like save your bowler </v>

2421
01:49:29.940 --> 01:49:31.800
<v Speaker 2>and you only like the bowl 40 minutes a </v>
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>

2422
01:49:31.801 --> 01:49:33.030
<v Speaker 2>but you want to be the best in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

2423
01:49:33.270 --> 01:49:36.240
<v Speaker 2>turn not gunna be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care what you want,</v>

2424
01:49:36.450 --> 01:49:37.283
<v Speaker 2>but the time and enthusiasm is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>tricky part that goes back to like </v>

2425
01:49:40.170 --> 01:49:41.003
<v Speaker 2>discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well also I was trying to make a bigger </v>

2426
01:49:45.510 --> 01:49:46.343
<v Speaker 2>jump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is how do you connect to being </v>

2427
01:49:50.650 --> 01:49:52.690
<v Speaker 2>enthusiastic?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't,</v>

2428
01:49:52.960 --> 01:49:55.570
<v Speaker 2>we'll think about how you were bummed </v>
<v Speaker 2>out about your set,</v>

2429
01:49:55.780 --> 01:49:56.613
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you got to the store and you had a </v>

2430
01:49:57.371 --> 01:50:02.371
<v Speaker 2>trick your brain into being more present</v>
<v Speaker 2>and more pumped up for your set.</v>

2431
01:50:03.100 --> 01:50:05.530
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when you did it was a joy.</v>

2432
01:50:05.710 --> 01:50:06.543
<v Speaker 2>I guess I'm trying to connect it to what</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about earlier about </v>

2433
01:50:08.291 --> 01:50:09.124
<v Speaker 2>people who get isolated and don't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>friends and don't have a feedback and </v>

2434
01:50:12.311 --> 01:50:17.311
<v Speaker 2>don't have those like tendrils of like </v>
<v Speaker 2>being able to make that leap so that,</v>

2435
01:50:19.150 --> 01:50:22.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you start like eating yourself alive and</v>

2436
01:50:23.170 --> 01:50:24.910
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think with everything,</v>

2437
01:50:24.940 --> 01:50:27.160
<v Speaker 2>it's like a little stuff climb out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the barrel,</v>

2438
01:50:27.161 --> 01:50:29.080
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're 300 pounds,</v>

2439
01:50:29.110 --> 01:50:31.610
<v Speaker 2>do not run a marathon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2440
01:50:31.840 --> 01:50:35.230
<v Speaker 2>Walk around the block.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you're a person who's been living</v>

2441
01:50:35.231 --> 01:50:38.350
<v Speaker 2>your life with a bunch of fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>negative thinking in your head,</v>

2442
01:50:38.740 --> 01:50:41.050
<v Speaker 2>take steps in the right direction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2443
01:50:41.080 --> 01:50:45.370
<v Speaker 2>take a step back and you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>acknowledge that step today.</v>

2444
01:50:45.371 --> 01:50:46.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember that.</v>

2445
01:50:46.900 --> 01:50:49.090
<v Speaker 2>I need to remember it and I need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>build on that,</v>

2446
01:50:49.300 --> 01:50:50.650
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can do that.</v>

2447
01:50:50.710 --> 01:50:51.640
<v Speaker 2>Anybody can do that.</v>

2448
01:50:51.640 --> 01:50:55.030
<v Speaker 2>You could just do it incrementally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a great podcast with this guy,</v>

2449
01:50:55.031 --> 01:50:58.060
<v Speaker 2>David Goggins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever heard of him?</v>

2450
01:50:58.420 --> 01:50:59.390
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2451
01:50:59.830 --> 01:51:03.210
<v Speaker 2>he's a navy seal who's also a famous </v>
<v Speaker 2>tech podcast,</v>

2452
01:51:03.220 --> 01:51:04.300
<v Speaker 2>but yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

2453
01:51:04.301 --> 01:51:06.550
<v Speaker 2>I heard a bit of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was talking about how,</v>

2454
01:51:06.580 --> 01:51:07.413
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a fat loser who kept making </v>

2455
01:51:09.041 --> 01:51:09.874
<v Speaker 2>excuses for himself and just like </v>
<v Speaker 2>drinking chocolate milkshakes every day </v>

2456
01:51:13.170 --> 01:51:15.610
<v Speaker 2>working for an exterminator and he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>fat as fuck.</v>

2457
01:51:15.611 --> 01:51:17.730
<v Speaker 2>And they just decided I don't want to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>this any more.</v>

2458
01:51:17.731 --> 01:51:20.720
<v Speaker 2>And he had these moments where he went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he went running,</v>

2459
01:51:20.721 --> 01:51:21.554
<v Speaker 2>he ran three quarters of a mile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then he turned around and walked back </v>

2460
01:51:23.111 --> 01:51:24.940
<v Speaker 2>home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was his first time running.</v>

2461
01:51:24.941 --> 01:51:25.774
<v Speaker 2>Like it wasn't quick that it became,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy runs a hundred miles at a time </v>

2462
01:51:28.870 --> 01:51:32.770
<v Speaker 2>and he was doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many fucking a hundred milers did he</v>

2463
01:51:32.771 --> 01:51:33.604
<v Speaker 2>do in a year?</v>

2464
01:51:33.790 --> 01:51:37.890
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't it crazy every week or every </v>
<v Speaker 2>other week or every month?</v>

2465
01:51:38.940 --> 01:51:41.440
<v Speaker 2>It was insane because when he played it </v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

2466
01:51:41.441 --> 01:51:43.690
<v Speaker 2>he showed us the website and he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2467
01:51:43.691 --> 01:51:45.130
<v Speaker 2>these are all the ones he did in a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

2468
01:51:45.131 --> 01:51:45.964
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like every week or two weeks he was </v>

2469
01:51:47.980 --> 01:51:50.620
<v Speaker 2>running a hundred miles like in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mountains and shit.</v>

2470
01:51:50.800 --> 01:51:53.760
<v Speaker 2>A hundred that's a 24 hour race.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2471
01:51:53.770 --> 01:51:56.380
<v Speaker 2>And he was doing it every week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking insane.</v>

2472
01:51:57.310 --> 01:51:58.143
<v Speaker 2>But this guy started out running three </v>
<v Speaker 2>quarters of a mile and then he quit and </v>

2473
01:52:00.341 --> 01:52:01.174
<v Speaker 2>turned around and walk back home cause </v>
<v Speaker 2>he was fat and he's eating milkshakes </v>

2474
01:52:02.921 --> 01:52:05.860
<v Speaker 2>every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's the same guy he be.</v>

2475
01:52:05.900 --> 01:52:06.733
<v Speaker 2>He with these little incremental steps </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then just deciding this is who I am </v>

2476
01:52:10.991 --> 01:52:11.824
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a guy who does what I say I'm </v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm going to change my life.</v>

<v Speaker 2>animal.</v>

<v Speaker 2>out of like motivation and discipline.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I am now,</v>

2481
01:52:27.730 --> 01:52:28.563

<v Speaker 2>his life and by him expressing that on </v>

<v Speaker 3>Now instead,</v>

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:06.500
<v Speaker 3>don't quit after three quarters of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>mile.</v>

2500
01:53:06.590 --> 01:53:09.230
<v Speaker 3>Now we're going to drink water instead </v>
<v Speaker 3>of drinking chocolate shakes,</v>

2501
01:53:09.410 --> 01:53:10.243
<v Speaker 3>we're going to eat healthy food and </v>
<v Speaker 3>tomorrow we're going to do a whole </v>

2502
01:53:12.021 --> 01:53:13.280
<v Speaker 3>fucking mile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's do it.</v>

2503
01:53:13.520 --> 01:53:15.200
<v Speaker 3>And then you do that mine like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit,</v>

2504
01:53:15.201 --> 01:53:16.310
<v Speaker 3>I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mark it down,</v>

2505
01:53:16.311 --> 01:53:17.360
<v Speaker 3>write it down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did a mile,</v>

2506
01:53:17.630 --> 01:53:18.463
<v Speaker 3>and then maybe take a day off and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe the next day tried to do it again </v>

2507
01:53:20.480 --> 01:53:23.330
<v Speaker 3>and then build with everything with </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy,</v>

2508
01:53:23.690 --> 01:53:26.060
<v Speaker 3>with fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure that's the case with music,</v>

2509
01:53:26.540 --> 01:53:27.390
<v Speaker 3>with everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2510
01:53:27.730 --> 01:53:29.540
<v Speaker 3>And to recognize that that's your </v>
<v Speaker 3>choice.</v>

2511
01:53:29.720 --> 01:53:32.090
<v Speaker 3>And I think of myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are some mornings where I'm like,</v>

2512
01:53:32.540 --> 01:53:34.470
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna sit and have a latte.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

2513
01:53:34.471 --> 01:53:36.350
<v Speaker 3>now there are mornings where I'm in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>workout.</v>

2514
01:53:36.380 --> 01:53:37.213
<v Speaker 3>Those are all my choices.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that one day you're going to be </v>

2515
01:53:39.471 --> 01:53:42.560
<v Speaker 3>that person that just kind of sits there</v>
<v Speaker 3>and stares out the window.</v>

2516
01:53:43.240 --> 01:53:44.240
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2517
01:53:44.360 --> 01:53:48.200
<v Speaker 3>that would not be work towards my </v>
<v Speaker 3>hundred miles that I'm trying to run.</v>

2518
01:53:48.260 --> 01:53:50.400
<v Speaker 3>That would put,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it might be a day where you daydream,</v>

2519
01:53:50.401 --> 01:53:53.570
<v Speaker 3>he'd come up with an amazing idea and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of loved that.</v>

2520
01:53:53.571 --> 01:53:57.320
<v Speaker 3>I spent the day leading up to that </v>
<v Speaker 3>standup on the spot.</v>

2521
01:53:57.500 --> 01:54:00.440
<v Speaker 3>Actually I thought we had our podcast </v>
<v Speaker 3>was yesterday.</v>

2522
01:54:00.441 --> 01:54:04.250
<v Speaker 3>I had to go back into my text and I kind</v>
<v Speaker 3>of like,</v>

2523
01:54:04.251 --> 01:54:05.084
<v Speaker 3>you know how you do when you like have </v>
<v Speaker 3>something to do at one so that I get 11 </v>

2524
01:54:08.511 --> 01:54:09.344
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I can't completely go do something </v>

2525
01:54:11.301 --> 01:54:11.540
<v Speaker 3>else.</v>

2526
01:54:11.540 --> 01:54:12.373
<v Speaker 3>So I kinda just agonized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then it was like 12 and I loved and </v>

2527
01:54:16.191 --> 01:54:17.360
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2528
01:54:17.450 --> 01:54:20.780
<v Speaker 3>it's not even today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now I like kind of like,</v>

2529
01:54:21.500 --> 01:54:23.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't do stuff.</v>

2530
01:54:23.331 --> 01:54:27.020
<v Speaker 3>I could have done it for a couple hours </v>
<v Speaker 3>and now you know,</v>

2531
01:54:27.200 --> 01:54:29.840
<v Speaker 3>I thought we were podcasting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so now I have all that time.</v>

2532
01:54:29.841 --> 01:54:31.120
<v Speaker 3>So I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2533
01:54:31.140 --> 01:54:33.140
<v Speaker 3>have that stand up on the spot show </v>
<v Speaker 3>tonight.</v>

2534
01:54:33.141 --> 01:54:38.141
<v Speaker 3>So I really was just looking down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You go [inaudible] if worked out.</v>

2535
01:54:41.451 --> 01:54:45.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this lady here she is.</v>

2536
01:54:45.170 --> 01:54:46.310
<v Speaker 3>Who Was it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pretty girl?</v>

2537
01:54:47.680 --> 01:54:50.360
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2538
01:54:50.361 --> 01:54:51.194
<v Speaker 3>so I weirdly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was kind of a productive day </v>

2539
01:54:53.061 --> 01:54:57.650
<v Speaker 3>because then when I got to the end and </v>
<v Speaker 3>was so appreciative,</v>

2540
01:54:57.920 --> 01:55:02.920
<v Speaker 3>it made me so aware of the nightmare of </v>
<v Speaker 3>my own head that I was the,</v>

2541
01:55:03.140 --> 01:55:07.040
<v Speaker 3>I was very conscious of what I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I was doing.</v>

2542
01:55:08.840 --> 01:55:09.920
<v Speaker 3>That got me to that.</v>

2543
01:55:09.920 --> 01:55:10.753
<v Speaker 3>Then when it was so easy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it really was like waking up from a bad </v>

2544
01:55:14.001 --> 01:55:15.470
<v Speaker 3>dream when you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2545
01:55:16.010 --> 01:55:16.843
<v Speaker 3>this is life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not that being engaged and being </v>

2546
01:55:20.811 --> 01:55:21.644
<v Speaker 3>present and going to do this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was nothing like what I was beating </v>

2547
01:55:25.701 --> 01:55:27.140
<v Speaker 3>myself up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2548
01:55:28.130 --> 01:55:30.060
<v Speaker 3>why are you doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is that?</v>

2549
01:55:30.070 --> 01:55:32.660
<v Speaker 3>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why you say you've done so many shows?</v>

2550
01:55:32.661 --> 01:55:34.400
<v Speaker 3>But I wasn't even acknowledging that </v>
<v Speaker 3>history.</v>

2551
01:55:34.401 --> 01:55:35.234
<v Speaker 3>I was just stewing in almost because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>had the time and I just let that run </v>

2552
01:55:40.011 --> 01:55:42.260
<v Speaker 3>rampant in my head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That voice of like,</v>

2553
01:55:42.620 --> 01:55:44.130
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>

2554
01:55:44.550 --> 01:55:46.650
<v Speaker 2>You think you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think you can construct a joke?</v>

2555
01:55:46.680 --> 01:55:50.130
<v Speaker 2>Good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know why?</v>

2556
01:55:51.170 --> 01:55:54.060
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why did I just feed that monster?</v>

2557
01:55:55.440 --> 01:55:56.273
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a common strategy that people </v>

2558
01:55:59.761 --> 01:56:03.440
<v Speaker 2>do to avoid accomplishing things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2559
01:56:03.600 --> 01:56:07.320
<v Speaker 2>And you do it subconsciously to give </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself a little bit of a break because</v>

2560
01:56:07.321 --> 01:56:10.170
<v Speaker 2>the pressure of like being disciplined </v>
<v Speaker 2>and doing things,</v>

2561
01:56:10.560 --> 01:56:12.300
<v Speaker 2>it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It weighs on you.</v>

2562
01:56:12.890 --> 01:56:16.170
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then that becomes an excuse to not,</v>

2563
01:56:16.440 --> 01:56:19.650
<v Speaker 2>we were talking before the podcast about</v>
<v Speaker 2>yoga and I was saying how,</v>

2564
01:56:19.710 --> 01:56:20.543
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I did that 15 days in a month </v>

2565
01:56:23.131 --> 01:56:23.964
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I decided to end it with nine days in a </v>

2566
01:56:25.651 --> 01:56:27.480
<v Speaker 2>row.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I just did nine days.</v>

2567
01:56:27.481 --> 01:56:28.950
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ended like a week early.</v>

2568
01:56:28.951 --> 01:56:31.440
<v Speaker 2>I finished like a week earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like five days early,</v>

2569
01:56:31.441 --> 01:56:35.850
<v Speaker 2>but I did nine fucking days of yoga in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>row to end it.</v>

2570
01:56:35.851 --> 01:56:36.870
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is crazy.</v>

2571
01:56:36.870 --> 01:56:39.900
<v Speaker 2>I never would've thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only that I could do it,</v>

2572
01:56:39.960 --> 01:56:43.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean I know I could physically do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not impossible,</v>

2573
01:56:43.200 --> 01:56:46.500
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't think I'd ever like fall </v>
<v Speaker 2>through and do that.</v>

2574
01:56:46.501 --> 01:56:47.334
<v Speaker 2>It just seems too extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was the beaker him that the </v>

2575
01:56:49.401 --> 01:56:50.234
<v Speaker 2>half.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2576
01:56:50.400 --> 01:56:51.260
<v Speaker 2>Which people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

2577
01:56:51.261 --> 01:56:52.920
<v Speaker 2>I do it everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did 60 days in a row.</v>

2578
01:56:52.921 --> 01:56:54.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I do like eight other things.</v>

2579
01:56:54.750 --> 01:56:59.090
<v Speaker 2>It's not easy to carve out an hour and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>half a fucking swinging dick off in this</v>

2580
01:57:00.030 --> 01:57:00.990
<v Speaker 2>workout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2581
01:57:00.991 --> 01:57:02.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm still lifting weights.</v>

2582
01:57:03.100 --> 01:57:04.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm still doing that too.</v>

2583
01:57:04.530 --> 01:57:05.363
<v Speaker 2>I'm not just doing yoga and I'm also </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing writing and the podcast and </v>

2584
01:57:10.650 --> 01:57:12.210
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>UFC shouldn't have to do.</v>

2585
01:57:12.350 --> 01:57:16.170
<v Speaker 2>Like I made myself do it too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in doing so,</v>

2586
01:57:16.171 --> 01:57:17.820
<v Speaker 2>I realized like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2587
01:57:17.821 --> 01:57:20.730
<v Speaker 2>you just got to just do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you just got to say you're going to</v>

2588
01:57:20.731 --> 01:57:21.930
<v Speaker 2>do it and just do it.</v>

2589
01:57:22.770 --> 01:57:26.280
<v Speaker 2>Like I did a thing a while back in like </v>
<v Speaker 2>2009,</v>

2590
01:57:26.310 --> 01:57:27.520
<v Speaker 2>but when I was writing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2591
01:57:28.320 --> 01:57:31.110
<v Speaker 2>I was up getting ready to do a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my comedy central special at the time,</v>

2592
01:57:31.140 --> 01:57:33.300
<v Speaker 2>or it was on spike tv than uncommon </v>
<v Speaker 2>central.</v>

2593
01:57:33.720 --> 01:57:34.410
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2594
01:57:34.410 --> 01:57:37.470
<v Speaker 2>I wrote every day for a month in my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my blog.</v>

2595
01:57:37.800 --> 01:57:40.640
<v Speaker 2>I just decided I'm gonna and I committed</v>
<v Speaker 2>to it online.</v>

2596
01:57:40.641 --> 01:57:42.600
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna write every day for a month.</v>

2597
01:57:42.960 --> 01:57:43.793
<v Speaker 2>And in doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2598
01:57:43.800 --> 01:57:44.550
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could do that.</v>

2599
01:57:44.550 --> 01:57:45.600
<v Speaker 2>Like you just got to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's,</v>

2600
01:57:45.601 --> 01:57:45.901
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>

2601
01:57:45.901 --> 01:57:47.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has to be just a thing you do.</v>

2602
01:57:47.701 --> 01:57:48.181
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2603
01:57:48.181 --> 01:57:49.650
<v Speaker 2>I brushed my teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2604
01:57:49.651 --> 01:57:51.030
<v Speaker 2>I comb my hair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2605
01:57:51.031 --> 01:57:52.230
<v Speaker 2>I right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2606
01:57:52.231 --> 01:57:53.064
<v Speaker 2>I get up and I run an while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get up and I lift weights for an hour </v>

2607
01:57:55.331 --> 01:57:58.560
<v Speaker 2>or whatever the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did the or did that yoga tip you one way</v>

2608
01:57:58.561 --> 01:57:59.010
<v Speaker 2>or the other?</v>

2609
01:57:59.010 --> 01:58:04.010
<v Speaker 2>Like make you more thirsty or more like </v>
<v Speaker 2>tired or more in the day?</v>

2610
01:58:05.110 --> 01:58:06.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it definitely makes you thirsty.</v>

2611
01:58:07.320 --> 01:58:09.090
<v Speaker 2>He fucking does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sweat so much.</v>

2612
01:58:10.090 --> 01:58:12.570
<v Speaker 2>I can be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't drink coffee.</v>

2613
01:58:12.571 --> 01:58:13.404
<v Speaker 2>I just was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need oranges and water and lemons and </v>

2614
01:58:16.291 --> 01:58:18.780
<v Speaker 2>oranges and water when you sweat so </v>
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>

2615
01:58:18.781 --> 01:58:19.614
<v Speaker 2>But does that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did that affect your other workout that </v>

2616
01:58:21.361 --> 01:58:23.730
<v Speaker 2>you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like was your body just like stop?</v>

2617
01:58:23.820 --> 01:58:25.260
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Drink a bunch of water?</v>

2618
01:58:25.410 --> 01:58:26.280
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

2619
01:58:26.310 --> 01:58:27.920
<v Speaker 2>it's easier because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2620
01:58:28.170 --> 01:58:30.660
<v Speaker 2>if I was going to do the yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

2621
01:58:30.661 --> 01:58:31.494
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would just do stuff like lifting </v>

2622
01:58:32.671 --> 01:58:35.670
<v Speaker 2>weights or something that night and </v>
<v Speaker 2>lifting weights is,</v>

2623
01:58:35.671 --> 01:58:38.310
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as opposed to running.</v>

2624
01:58:38.360 --> 01:58:39.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I'd run,</v>

2625
01:58:39.590 --> 01:58:40.423
<v Speaker 2>I'd do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to run though in the morning </v>

2626
01:58:41.381 --> 01:58:44.080
<v Speaker 2>and do yoga later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe I'll run at eight and then do</v>

2627
01:58:44.081 --> 01:58:48.670
<v Speaker 2>yoga at 10 30 I've done that because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a cardio thing really.</v>

2628
01:58:48.700 --> 01:58:49.533
<v Speaker 2>You know yoga and also like I like doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>yoga and my legs are burnt out cause </v>

2629
01:58:53.261 --> 01:58:56.050
<v Speaker 2>then like I'd get more flexibility out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of them.</v>

2630
01:58:56.410 --> 01:59:00.820
<v Speaker 2>I feel like your tissues get really beat</v>
<v Speaker 2>up and then they become more pliable.</v>

2631
01:59:00.850 --> 01:59:03.700
<v Speaker 2>If you could just force past that little</v>
<v Speaker 2>pain barrier,</v>

2632
01:59:04.150 --> 01:59:04.983
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really like lifting weights and then </v>
