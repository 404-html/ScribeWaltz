<v Speaker 1>Donta.</v>

2
00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:04.630
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.260
<v Speaker 1>and we're back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's up buddy</v>

4
00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.990
<v Speaker 1>tan really and joined the southern</v>
<v Speaker 1>California weather,</v>

5
00:00:12.991 --> 00:00:15.930
<v Speaker 1>sir,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my biggest problem everyday is to decide</v>

6
00:00:15.931 --> 00:00:19.470
<v Speaker 1>which beach between La and San Diego to</v>
<v Speaker 1>hit.</v>

7
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.860
<v Speaker 1>Would you bragging,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bragging about your lacks problems?</v>

8
00:00:22.861 --> 00:00:26.690
<v Speaker 1>My privileged life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're brown privilege,</v>

9
00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.340
<v Speaker 1>like Brown privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a bronze.</v>

10
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:33.570
<v Speaker 1>It's a very bronze shine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a few days it'll settle in and that's</v>

11
00:00:33.571 --> 00:00:35.890
<v Speaker 1>when the true glory of God comes up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

12
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.490
<v Speaker 1>I bet your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your vitamin D levels are at an all time</v>

13
00:00:38.491 --> 00:00:42.000
<v Speaker 1>high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to take them in for the Montreal</v>

14
00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:42.540
<v Speaker 1>winters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

15
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.880
<v Speaker 1>Do you supplement and when you were in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the winter in Montreal,</v>

16
00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.250
<v Speaker 1>you don't died a hundred percent vitamin</v>
<v Speaker 1>D's.</v>

17
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.020
<v Speaker 1>It's a critical factor or I'd just come</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to do your show in the winter and</v>

18
00:00:52.021 --> 00:00:54.030
<v Speaker 1>then that's how I got myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's enough.</v>

19
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.510
<v Speaker 1>I need that vitamin D,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a big thing with the,</v>

20
00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.810
<v Speaker 1>apparently with people that live in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seattle in the winter is taking vitamin</v>

21
00:01:00.811 --> 00:01:02.640
<v Speaker 1>D and even sun tanning beds.</v>

22
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.950
<v Speaker 1>People don't realize it's sun tanning</v>
<v Speaker 1>beds,</v>

23
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.620
<v Speaker 1>although it's kind of counterintuitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think they're really bad for you?</v>

24
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.830
<v Speaker 1>It's actually not that bad for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As long as you don't burn yourself.</v>

25
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.110
<v Speaker 1>It's actually good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a study a while,</v>

26
00:01:13.111 --> 00:01:14.160
<v Speaker 1>a paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote it.</v>

27
00:01:14.161 --> 00:01:17.760
<v Speaker 1>This was a theoretical paper with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dermatologist a few years ago where we</v>

28
00:01:17.761 --> 00:01:22.761
<v Speaker 1>looked at some evolutionary explanations</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the epidemiology of suntanning.</v>

29
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.430
<v Speaker 1>So if I were to ask her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not without you knowing anything about</v>

30
00:01:26.431 --> 00:01:28.020
<v Speaker 1>it or not much about evolutionary</v>
<v Speaker 1>theory,</v>

31
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.010
<v Speaker 1>who do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the typical demographic of the</v>

32
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.080
<v Speaker 1>sort of obsessive Santana [inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

33
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.920
<v Speaker 1>Well women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>young,</v>

34
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.390
<v Speaker 1>bright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>single.</v>

35
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.590
<v Speaker 1>And they usually tend to discount the</v>
<v Speaker 1>future consequences for the immediate</v>

36
00:01:43.591 --> 00:01:44.340
<v Speaker 1>benefits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

37
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.900
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the smoking cigarettes,</v>

38
00:01:45.901 --> 00:01:47.190
<v Speaker 1>they probably smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

39
00:01:47.191 --> 00:01:51.480
<v Speaker 1>So it doesn't matter whether I'll get my</v>
<v Speaker 1>window when I'm 73 I'm going tonight to</v>

40
00:01:51.481 --> 00:01:53.390
<v Speaker 1>the Party and Tony might be there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to,</v>

41
00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:55.710
<v Speaker 1>and so we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

42
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.170
<v Speaker 1>so with this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this dermatologist friend of mine had</v>

43
00:01:58.171 --> 00:01:59.970
<v Speaker 1>written to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was doing his fellowship and he said,</v>

44
00:01:59.971 --> 00:02:00.480
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got,</v>

45
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.580
<v Speaker 1>as part of my research requirements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to write a paper,</v>

46
00:02:02.581 --> 00:02:03.200
<v Speaker 1>can I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

47
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.140
<v Speaker 1>you're the big researcher.</v>

48
00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.670
<v Speaker 1>Can I do a paper with you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

49
00:02:05.671 --> 00:02:07.410
<v Speaker 1>but you're a dermatologist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What can we talk about?</v>

50
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:08.580
<v Speaker 1>And then I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

51
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.810
<v Speaker 1>let's do the evolutionary roots of</v>
<v Speaker 1>suntanning and there.</v>

52
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.850
<v Speaker 1>And that's how that paper came to be is</v>
<v Speaker 1>how was that evolutionary though?</v>

53
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.030
<v Speaker 1>What's evolutionary about white girls</v>
<v Speaker 1>that don't think about the future?</v>

54
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.961
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

55
00:02:18.961 --> 00:02:19.794
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

56
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.510
<v Speaker 1>are there particular ways that we can</v>
<v Speaker 1>predict the demographics of people who</v>

57
00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:26.160
<v Speaker 1>do certain behaviors?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

58
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.760
<v Speaker 1>pathological gambling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who Do you think is likely to succumb to</v>

59
00:02:29.761 --> 00:02:33.120
<v Speaker 1>that affliction?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pathological gambling.</v>

60
00:02:33.121 --> 00:02:34.260
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

61
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.330
<v Speaker 1>men are with men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>adult men in their thirties.</v>

62
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.840
<v Speaker 1>Low status,</v>
<v Speaker 1>low status on average.</v>

63
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.440
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason is because it's,</v>

64
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.730
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of a multitude of strategies to</v>

65
00:02:47.731 --> 00:02:49.020
<v Speaker 1>acquire resources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

66
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.390
<v Speaker 1>It's the same reason that men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rob banks,</v>

67
00:02:51.391 --> 00:02:52.830
<v Speaker 1>not women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you could,</v>

68
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.233
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's do another one.</v>

69
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.090
<v Speaker 1>Eating disorders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who Do you think it's,</v>

70
00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.730
<v Speaker 1>it comes to eating disorders?</v>
<v Speaker 1>More anorexia Nervosa in particular.</v>

71
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.080
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women limit.</v>

72
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.880
<v Speaker 1>Now typically the social science</v>
<v Speaker 1>explanation is old,</v>

73
00:03:05.881 --> 00:03:09.340
<v Speaker 1>just due to exposure to media images,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right at that turns out to be a</v>

74
00:03:09.341 --> 00:03:11.620
<v Speaker 1>laughably false premise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is it laughable?</v>

75
00:03:11.621 --> 00:03:13.300
<v Speaker 1>So here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the evolutionary angle.</v>

76
00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.790
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hippocrates,</v>

77
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.880
<v Speaker 1>founder of modern medicine 2000 plus</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago had documented the exact same</v>

78
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.820
<v Speaker 1>epidemiology of eating disorder</v>
<v Speaker 1>disorders in women.</v>

79
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.560
<v Speaker 1>So it certainly can't be because of</v>
<v Speaker 1>media,</v>

80
00:03:26.561 --> 00:03:27.310
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there,</v>

81
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.310
<v Speaker 1>there must be something biological that</v>
<v Speaker 1>explains the sex specificity of these</v>

82
00:03:32.831 --> 00:03:34.090
<v Speaker 1>different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

83
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:35.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dark side consumption.</v>

84
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.630
<v Speaker 1>And so the evolutionary perspective is</v>
<v Speaker 1>to then look at to the extent that these</v>

85
00:03:40.631 --> 00:03:45.631
<v Speaker 1>human universals manifest themselves in</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly the same way across time and</v>

86
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.460
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What might be some of these biological</v>

87
00:03:48.461 --> 00:03:51.190
<v Speaker 1>drivers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>compulsive buying almost exclusively</v>

88
00:03:51.191 --> 00:03:52.450
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>90% women,</v>

89
00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pornographic addictions,</v>

90
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.190
<v Speaker 1>almost exclusively male.</v>

91
00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.800
<v Speaker 1>And let's just stick with this one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's just stick with this one.</v>

92
00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.190
<v Speaker 1>The anorexia Nervosa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

93
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.620
<v Speaker 1>when you're talking about hippocrates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about one lone</v>

94
00:04:05.621 --> 00:04:07.900
<v Speaker 1>individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so completely anecdotal piece of</v>

95
00:04:07.901 --> 00:04:12.901
<v Speaker 1>evidence and he said that women were</v>
<v Speaker 1>throwing up at a status symbol back then</v>

96
00:04:13.001 --> 00:04:15.880
<v Speaker 1>for women to be overweight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it actually,</v>

97
00:04:15.881 --> 00:04:16.714
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a good question.</v>

98
00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.690
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating disorders are much more likely to</v>

99
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.720
<v Speaker 1>occur in cultures of plenty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

100
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.870
<v Speaker 1>Precisely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the argument is that you can</v>

101
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.780
<v Speaker 1>shut off your reproductive window today</v>
<v Speaker 1>because when,</v>

102
00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.920
<v Speaker 1>what happens when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so here's the evolutionary angle.</v>

103
00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.310
<v Speaker 1>When you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you suffer from eating disorder,</v>

104
00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.980
<v Speaker 1>the first thing that happens</v>
<v Speaker 1>physiologically is you get what's called</v>

105
00:04:35.981 --> 00:04:39.010
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] Arabia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Primary Laminaria is where you haven't</v>

106
00:04:39.011 --> 00:04:41.260
<v Speaker 1>had your mentees yet and now they don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>come out.</v>

107
00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.410
<v Speaker 1>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no onsite and recycle.</v>

108
00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you say menzies?</v>

109
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.940
<v Speaker 1>Your mentees?</v>

110
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:46.691
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>

111
00:04:46.691 --> 00:04:48.440
<v Speaker 1>is that like the technical term for it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the,</v>

112
00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:49.680
<v Speaker 1>it's the fancy term for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

113
00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.490
<v Speaker 1>MNCS,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone said it sounds like something a</v>

114
00:04:51.491 --> 00:04:54.130
<v Speaker 1>little kid would call it mommy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't get my mentees.</v>

115
00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:55.690
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

116
00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.130
<v Speaker 1>now secondary amenorrhea is where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>already had your menstrual cycle and</v>

117
00:05:00.131 --> 00:05:03.460
<v Speaker 1>then it's shut off once you become,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you have anorexia Nervosa.</v>

118
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.570
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well what happens when you have an</v>

119
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.590
<v Speaker 1>erection when you have avenue area is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you,</v>

120
00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:08.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

121
00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.440
<v Speaker 1>your reproductive potential shut off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

122
00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.920
<v Speaker 1>And so what evolutionary scientists have</v>
<v Speaker 1>found is that it turns out that when</v>

123
00:05:14.921 --> 00:05:19.150
<v Speaker 1>women suffer from Anorexia Nervosa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is some environmental trigger that</v>

124
00:05:19.151 --> 00:05:23.950
<v Speaker 1>they're being exposed to Co.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rightly so or wrongly so that they think</v>

125
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:27.670
<v Speaker 1>they should shut off their mentees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They reproductive potential for a better</v>

126
00:05:27.671 --> 00:05:29.110
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see what I'm saying.</v>

127
00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:30.220
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

128
00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.771
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and let me,</v>

129
00:05:30.771 --> 00:05:31.870
<v Speaker 1>let me give you the background to this.</v>

130
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.450
<v Speaker 1>There's a model called the reproductive</v>
<v Speaker 1>suppression model,</v>

131
00:05:34.451 --> 00:05:37.180
<v Speaker 1>found an other mammalian species that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>say a cow.</v>

132
00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:38.980
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you take a cow,</v>

133
00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.340
<v Speaker 1>what would be the biggest environmental</v>
<v Speaker 1>threat that it faces other than</v>

134
00:05:42.341 --> 00:05:45.280
<v Speaker 1>predators?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would you think about tainted water</v>

135
00:05:45.281 --> 00:05:47.770
<v Speaker 1>or food or just how much food she can</v>
<v Speaker 1>have?</v>

136
00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:50.320
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause she had access to enough calories</v>

137
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.690
<v Speaker 1>to sustain her gestational period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

138
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.870
<v Speaker 1>Well it turns out that in in Mammalian</v>
<v Speaker 1>species,</v>

139
00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:00.080
<v Speaker 1>a wide range of movie alien species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somehow there was a mechanism in</v>

140
00:06:00.081 --> 00:06:03.770
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary mechanism that either</v>
<v Speaker 1>causes the females of the species to</v>

141
00:06:03.771 --> 00:06:07.790
<v Speaker 1>either shut off they reproductive window</v>
<v Speaker 1>or if they're already pregnant.</v>

142
00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.280
<v Speaker 1>And then there's an environmental input</v>
<v Speaker 1>that says,</v>

143
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:11.540
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not looking good.</v>

144
00:06:11.541 --> 00:06:13.640
<v Speaker 1>What do you think happens to their body?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did they do with the video board?</v>

145
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:14.990
<v Speaker 1>The fetus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they abort the fetus.</v>

146
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:19.160
<v Speaker 1>And now postnatally you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>infanticide.</v>

147
00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:23.570
<v Speaker 1>So in this case you have the child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you realize for whatever</v>

148
00:06:23.571 --> 00:06:27.650
<v Speaker 1>environmental reason that it's not going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be fruitful to raise that child and</v>

149
00:06:27.651 --> 00:06:30.320
<v Speaker 1>you buy where you fall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see it in human cultures where</v>

150
00:06:30.321 --> 00:06:34.340
<v Speaker 1>typically the one who was killed as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>last born as you would expect because</v>

151
00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.740
<v Speaker 1>the other children now you've invested</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite a bit in them.</v>

152
00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:40.880
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're going to get rid of</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of your genetic package,</v>

153
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.720
<v Speaker 1>you get rid of the one that you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>invested Leeson.</v>

154
00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.220
<v Speaker 1>So all of these mechanisms that are part</v>
<v Speaker 1>of something called the reproductive</v>

155
00:06:46.221 --> 00:06:49.910
<v Speaker 1>suppression model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea is that eating disorders is a</v>

156
00:06:49.911 --> 00:06:53.510
<v Speaker 1>special instanciation of that because</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the eating disorder is doing,</v>

157
00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:57.080
<v Speaker 1>it's shutting off your reproductive</v>
<v Speaker 1>potential because you're getting</v>

158
00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:58.820
<v Speaker 1>amenorrhea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

159
00:06:58.821 --> 00:07:03.110
<v Speaker 1>But is that absolutely connected to why</v>
<v Speaker 1>women get anorexic?</v>

160
00:07:03.111 --> 00:07:07.430
<v Speaker 1>Because it could easily be just a side</v>
<v Speaker 1>effect of them wanting to be</v>

161
00:07:07.431 --> 00:07:09.380
<v Speaker 1>ridiculously skinny like it.</v>

162
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:13.880
<v Speaker 1>Like I would understand with a cow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with something that's living in a very</v>

163
00:07:13.881 --> 00:07:15.980
<v Speaker 1>wild life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a wild world,</v>

164
00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:18.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this animal out there just eating grass</v>

165
00:07:18.621 --> 00:07:21.740
<v Speaker 1>and when resources are depleted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like nature kicks in.</v>

166
00:07:21.741 --> 00:07:23.570
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's no conscious decision making</v>

167
00:07:23.571 --> 00:07:26.450
<v Speaker 1>process when a woman is deciding to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>anorexic.</v>

168
00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:31.900
<v Speaker 1>At least there's some form of decision</v>
<v Speaker 1>making process that wants her to lean</v>

169
00:07:32.241 --> 00:07:37.190
<v Speaker 1>towards a slimmer physique.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that speaks to a very interesting</v>

170
00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.890
<v Speaker 1>distinction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so bear with me as I set it up.</v>

171
00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:42.140
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something in evolutionary theory</v>

172
00:07:42.141 --> 00:07:45.080
<v Speaker 1>known as proximate versus ultimate</v>
<v Speaker 1>explanations,</v>

173
00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.870
<v Speaker 1>proximity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And actually that speaks to the article</v>

174
00:07:47.871 --> 00:07:49.580
<v Speaker 1>that I had sent you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the points that I</v>

175
00:07:49.581 --> 00:07:52.280
<v Speaker 1>discussed in that article.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Proximate explanations and science.</v>

176
00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:56.150
<v Speaker 1>Explain the how and the what of</v>
<v Speaker 1>something much of science operates at</v>

177
00:07:56.151 --> 00:07:59.750
<v Speaker 1>the approximate level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to explain what diabetes is</v>

178
00:07:59.751 --> 00:08:01.370
<v Speaker 1>exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>physiologically speaking,</v>

179
00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:03.320
<v Speaker 1>you'll explain it at the approximate</v>
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>

180
00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:06.770
<v Speaker 1>The ultimate explanation is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Darwinian why,</v>

181
00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.950
<v Speaker 1>why would something have evolved to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that form?</v>

182
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.970
<v Speaker 1>So let's discuss it in relation to</v>
<v Speaker 1>something related to eating disorders.</v>

183
00:08:13.971 --> 00:08:15.440
<v Speaker 1>Pregnancies taken us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

184
00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:19.550
<v Speaker 1>So pregnancy sickness is a phenomenon</v>
<v Speaker 1>that women experience around the world.</v>

185
00:08:19.551 --> 00:08:21.830
<v Speaker 1>That's a universal phenomenon found in</v>
<v Speaker 1>all cultures.</v>

186
00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:24.350
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>approximate explanation might be,</v>

187
00:08:24.351 --> 00:08:29.180
<v Speaker 1>or approximately exploration might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do shifts in a woman's,</v>

188
00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>estrogen levels affect the severity of</v>

189
00:08:32.541 --> 00:08:34.790
<v Speaker 1>her symptoms?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's approximate question.</v>

190
00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:40.270
<v Speaker 1>The ultimate question is why have women</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolved that physiological response</v>

191
00:08:40.521 --> 00:08:43.280
<v Speaker 1>before I give the answer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you guess what that might be?</v>

192
00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:46.370
<v Speaker 1>Why do they develop that ultimate</v>
<v Speaker 1>response?</v>

193
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:50.350
<v Speaker 1>So why is it that women experience Prek?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

194
00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:53.390
<v Speaker 1>I call it pregnancy sickness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean the typical colloquial term</v>

195
00:08:53.391 --> 00:08:56.580
<v Speaker 1>is morning sickness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some women don't experience it in</v>

196
00:08:56.581 --> 00:08:58.020
<v Speaker 1>the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea why.</v>

197
00:08:58.021 --> 00:08:59.130
<v Speaker 1>Tell me why you ready.</v>

198
00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:02.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So pregnancy sickness happens during the</v>

199
00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:07.760
<v Speaker 1>first trimester of gestation during a</v>
<v Speaker 1>period called organogenesis.</v>

200
00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:12.810
<v Speaker 1>This is when the fetus is developing its</v>
<v Speaker 1>main organs during that particular</v>

201
00:09:12.811 --> 00:09:15.660
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's particularly important that the</v>

202
00:09:15.661 --> 00:09:20.661
<v Speaker 1>women not be exposed to food pathogens</v>
<v Speaker 1>teratogens that might harm the</v>

203
00:09:21.841 --> 00:09:25.560
<v Speaker 1>developmental pathway of the fetus is</v>
<v Speaker 1>organs.</v>

204
00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.200
<v Speaker 1>Therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the mechanisms that she</v>

205
00:09:28.201 --> 00:09:31.590
<v Speaker 1>experiences attraction to certain foods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pickles,</v>

206
00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:33.930
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>repulsion from other foods.</v>

207
00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:37.290
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the feeling of feeling,</v>

208
00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:37.711
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

209
00:09:37.711 --> 00:09:39.330
<v Speaker 1>being nauseous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the throwing up,</v>

210
00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:44.100
<v Speaker 1>all of those built in mechanisms are</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolved mechanisms that are meant to</v>

211
00:09:44.101 --> 00:09:49.101
<v Speaker 1>protect possibly the fetus from being</v>
<v Speaker 1>exposed to teratogens and it's perfectly</v>

212
00:09:49.201 --> 00:09:54.201
<v Speaker 1>timed so that once organogenesis ends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when the pregnancy sips symptoms.</v>

213
00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.510
<v Speaker 1>And so the difference between proximate</v>
<v Speaker 1>and ultimate,</v>

214
00:09:57.511 --> 00:10:00.540
<v Speaker 1>it's not that one is a better</v>
<v Speaker 1>explanation than the other is that you</v>

215
00:10:00.541 --> 00:10:04.980
<v Speaker 1>need both levels of explanations to</v>
<v Speaker 1>perfectly understand something.</v>

216
00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:09.690
<v Speaker 1>Well that makes total sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't necessarily apply to why</v>

217
00:10:09.691 --> 00:10:14.520
<v Speaker 1>women become anorexic because the desire</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be slim,</v>

218
00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:19.550
<v Speaker 1>to look very thin in public is very</v>
<v Speaker 1>strong because of social media or media</v>

219
00:10:19.711 --> 00:10:20.420
<v Speaker 1>rather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

220
00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:24.360
<v Speaker 1>the depictions of women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're always almost impossibly slam.</v>

221
00:10:24.361 --> 00:10:26.670
<v Speaker 1>And then on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they also had photoshop to it.</v>

222
00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:28.320
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in the,</v>

223
00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.600
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the evolutionary explanation to the</v>

224
00:10:30.601 --> 00:10:35.460
<v Speaker 1>eating disorder story is there is</v>
<v Speaker 1>something in the environment that the</v>

225
00:10:35.461 --> 00:10:39.750
<v Speaker 1>woman in question is thinking is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>threat to her.</v>

226
00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:43.710
<v Speaker 1>Could you think the same thing as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cow felt for the lack of calories?</v>

227
00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:46.920
<v Speaker 1>Can you think in the human context?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What might be such a threat?</v>

228
00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:49.460
<v Speaker 1>Do you see what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what?</v>

229
00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:51.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would be such a salt,</v>

230
00:10:51.211 --> 00:10:53.430
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you feel rightly or wrongly,</v>

231
00:10:53.431 --> 00:10:53.940
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't.</v>

232
00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:55.830
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter whether they</v>
<v Speaker 1>objectively it's true or not.</v>

233
00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:57.660
<v Speaker 1>Whatever she feels is what the reality</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

234
00:10:57.661 --> 00:11:00.450
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If she feels that there isn't going to</v>

235
00:11:00.451 --> 00:11:03.870
<v Speaker 1>be sufficient either can support,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extended,</v>

236
00:11:03.871 --> 00:11:08.010
<v Speaker 1>can support when she raises the child or</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most likely thing is partner</v>

237
00:11:08.011 --> 00:11:10.530
<v Speaker 1>support.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If she feels that there isn't likely to</v>

238
00:11:10.531 --> 00:11:14.520
<v Speaker 1>be a good partner who's going to support</v>
<v Speaker 1>her since we are by parental species,</v>

239
00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:19.830
<v Speaker 1>then she engages at and shutting down</v>
<v Speaker 1>her reproductive window.</v>

240
00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:24.570
<v Speaker 1>Hence what you said is true at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>proximate level,</v>

241
00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:27.570
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her thinking can become this disordered</v>

242
00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:30.750
<v Speaker 1>so that she actually looks at herself in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mirror even though she's only 70</v>

243
00:11:30.751 --> 00:11:32.970
<v Speaker 1>pounds and she still thinks that she's</v>
<v Speaker 1>fat,</v>

244
00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:36.960
<v Speaker 1>but that's approximate explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the explanation that I've given you</v>

245
00:11:36.961 --> 00:11:40.320
<v Speaker 1>is the ultimate Darwinian white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Together they make a full,</v>

246
00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:45.630
<v Speaker 1>complete explanation of the phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it doesn't occur in people that have</v>

247
00:11:45.631 --> 00:11:50.631
<v Speaker 1>very healthy relationships with a spouse</v>
<v Speaker 1>or it occurs much more rarely.</v>

248
00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:52.260
<v Speaker 1>Much more rare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

249
00:11:52.261 --> 00:11:54.910
<v Speaker 1>So the research shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the evolutionary research shows that the</v>

250
00:11:54.911 --> 00:11:59.911
<v Speaker 1>environmental threats equivalent to</v>
<v Speaker 1>lacking of grazing area for the cow is</v>

251
00:12:00.761 --> 00:12:05.380
<v Speaker 1>lack of extended,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can support or made support to the</v>

252
00:12:05.381 --> 00:12:07.030
<v Speaker 1>woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that makes sense?</v>

253
00:12:07.031 --> 00:12:10.270
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it is primarily single women,</v>

254
00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:13.510
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That they'd have anorexia and that's</v>

255
00:12:13.511 --> 00:12:14.350
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

256
00:12:14.351 --> 00:12:18.880
<v Speaker 1>you see it in cultures of plenti rather</v>
<v Speaker 1>than an Ethiopia because you would</v>

257
00:12:18.881 --> 00:12:23.140
<v Speaker 1>expect that the woman who shuts off her</v>
<v Speaker 1>reproductive potential today,</v>

258
00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:27.490
<v Speaker 1>it's because she's hoping that in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>future state things will be better for</v>

259
00:12:27.491 --> 00:12:29.350
<v Speaker 1>her to get back on the reproductive</v>
<v Speaker 1>train.</v>

260
00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:33.220
<v Speaker 1>When you're in Ethiopia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a chance to shut off my</v>

261
00:12:33.221 --> 00:12:35.680
<v Speaker 1>reproductive potential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to get the food tomorrow,</v>

262
00:12:35.681 --> 00:12:37.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

263
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:38.830
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

264
00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:42.250
<v Speaker 1>But that still doesn't cover is</v>
<v Speaker 1>hippocrates.</v>

265
00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:44.980
<v Speaker 1>Hippocrates is just one guy who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

266
00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:49.210
<v Speaker 1>Who had a sufficient database at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time to,</v>

267
00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:53.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>describe the findings in very similar</v>

268
00:12:53.051 --> 00:12:56.620
<v Speaker 1>farms to the current ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying basically is that if</v>

269
00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:01.680
<v Speaker 1>it's were that it's due to media images</v>
<v Speaker 1>then well he didn't have media and it</v>

270
00:13:02.591 --> 00:13:03.401
<v Speaker 1>just at that time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

271
00:13:03.401 --> 00:13:05.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean so how would it be that an</v>
<v Speaker 1>ancient Greece,</v>

272
00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:10.440
<v Speaker 1>it is also the case that is only women</v>
<v Speaker 1>who experienced an erection or votes.</v>

273
00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:12.940
<v Speaker 1>What did he describe?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was he talking about?</v>

274
00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:14.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean the specifics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

275
00:13:14.081 --> 00:13:15.910
<v Speaker 1>So I haven't read the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the original,</v>

276
00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:17.170
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of managing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

277
00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:21.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean cause I'm just aren't like</v>
<v Speaker 1>ancient depictions of women.</v>

278
00:13:21.701 --> 00:13:23.710
<v Speaker 1>Like it's desirable for them to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>overweight.</v>

279
00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:25.210
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It depends on the culture.</v>

280
00:13:25.211 --> 00:13:29.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean the usual universal that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>typically talk of in terms of body types</v>

281
00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:33.220
<v Speaker 1>is that it'd be an hourglass figure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which actually is going to speak to the</v>

282
00:13:33.221 --> 00:13:33.820
<v Speaker 1>second point.</v>

283
00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:36.820
<v Speaker 1>That other paper that I send you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so an evolutionary theory.</v>

284
00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:40.990
<v Speaker 1>What we do typically is we build what</v>
<v Speaker 1>are called neurological networks of</v>

285
00:13:40.991 --> 00:13:42.220
<v Speaker 1>cumulative evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

286
00:13:42.221 --> 00:13:44.050
<v Speaker 1>when you're trying to make an</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary argument,</v>

287
00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:47.470
<v Speaker 1>it's you don't just come up with a post</v>
<v Speaker 1>hoc story as some people who don't</v>

288
00:13:47.471 --> 00:13:49.570
<v Speaker 1>understand evolutionary theory like to</v>
<v Speaker 1>say that,</v>

289
00:13:49.571 --> 00:13:52.000
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just concoct these post hoc</v>

290
00:13:52.001 --> 00:13:54.520
<v Speaker 1>speculative evolutionary stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a matter of fact,</v>

291
00:13:55.120 --> 00:14:00.010
<v Speaker 1>the evidentiary threshold that</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionists typically seek to achieve</v>

292
00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:02.800
<v Speaker 1>is actually very high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's take the hourglass figure for</v>

293
00:14:02.801 --> 00:14:03.634
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

294
00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:09.090
<v Speaker 1>so what is some data that would convince</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that men have evolved the pension</v>

295
00:14:09.191 --> 00:14:11.340
<v Speaker 1>for the hourglass figure?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's go through some of these.</v>

296
00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:12.540
<v Speaker 1>You Ready?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

297
00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:13.750
<v Speaker 1>What is some data?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

298
00:14:13.751 --> 00:14:16.660
<v Speaker 1>So in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I wanted to convince you</v>

299
00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:21.690
<v Speaker 1>unequivocally of the adaptive argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the evolutionary argument as to why men</v>

300
00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:26.560
<v Speaker 1>might prefer the hourglass figure so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they should have bigger hips,</v>

301
00:14:26.561 --> 00:14:31.420
<v Speaker 1>it would make it easier for her to breed</v>
<v Speaker 1>larger fat deposits in the breasts in</v>

302
00:14:31.421 --> 00:14:31.960
<v Speaker 1>the ass.</v>

303
00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:35.540
<v Speaker 1>It makes it healthier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She has fat storing for she's,</v>

304
00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:37.120
<v Speaker 1>she'll have healthy offspring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

305
00:14:37.121 --> 00:14:40.960
<v Speaker 1>so let me jump in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you had medical and reproductive</v>

306
00:14:40.961 --> 00:14:45.280
<v Speaker 1>data that shows that women who have that</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular body type are more likely to</v>

307
00:14:45.281 --> 00:14:47.980
<v Speaker 1>conceive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that would be one check and we have</v>

308
00:14:47.981 --> 00:14:48.520
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

309
00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:52.310
<v Speaker 1>Then we might look for human universals</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that preference.</v>

310
00:14:52.311 --> 00:14:55.400
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't simply use data from Ucla</v>

311
00:14:55.401 --> 00:14:58.280
<v Speaker 1>undergrads to tell us what types of body</v>
<v Speaker 1>types would prefer.</v>

312
00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:01.610
<v Speaker 1>We go to the animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more tribe in the Amazon and ask them</v>

313
00:15:01.611 --> 00:15:03.560
<v Speaker 1>what type of body types they prefer and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so on.</v>

314
00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:06.950
<v Speaker 1>So if you then demonstrate the</v>
<v Speaker 1>universality of that preference,</v>

315
00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:10.400
<v Speaker 1>that's another check.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we could look at art data.</v>

316
00:15:10.401 --> 00:15:13.060
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you pointed to some of the depictions so</v>

317
00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:16.310
<v Speaker 1>we can ask Ruben.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can look at data from ancient Greece,</v>

318
00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:19.910
<v Speaker 1>from ancient Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pharaohs and so on from Africa,</v>

319
00:15:19.911 --> 00:15:22.670
<v Speaker 1>from India,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we could take the statues from those</v>

320
00:15:22.671 --> 00:15:26.660
<v Speaker 1>cultures spanning several thousand years</v>
<v Speaker 1>and do a content analysis of the statues</v>

321
00:15:26.661 --> 00:15:29.510
<v Speaker 1>and show that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they come very close to that hourglass</v>

322
00:15:29.511 --> 00:15:32.510
<v Speaker 1>figure we could take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's not enough data,</v>

323
00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:34.220
<v Speaker 1>this one's going to clinch it for you.</v>

324
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:36.320
<v Speaker 1>But there's many others that I could</v>
<v Speaker 1>give you.</v>

325
00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:41.740
<v Speaker 1>You could take congenitally blind men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are men who have never had the</v>

326
00:15:41.751 --> 00:15:45.050
<v Speaker 1>gift of sight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you could show haptically through</v>

327
00:15:45.051 --> 00:15:49.580
<v Speaker 1>touch that they prefer women that have</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hourglass figure,</v>

328
00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:52.160
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which immediately negates the</v>

329
00:15:52.161 --> 00:15:56.600
<v Speaker 1>possibility that it's due to the fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they were taught those preferences</v>

330
00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:01.040
<v Speaker 1>through the media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you systematically collect data</v>

331
00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:05.780
<v Speaker 1>from multiple converging lines of</v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence where that that data becomes</v>

332
00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.540
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes unassailable.</v>

333
00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:10.700
<v Speaker 1>And that's how you built an adaptive</v>
<v Speaker 1>argument.</v>

334
00:16:10.701 --> 00:16:12.860
<v Speaker 1>So contrary to all the guys who say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

335
00:16:12.861 --> 00:16:15.560
<v Speaker 1>evolution has just come up with these</v>
<v Speaker 1>cute post-hoc stories,</v>

336
00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:19.670
<v Speaker 1>we're actually profoundly more</v>
<v Speaker 1>meticulous and a situation.</v>

337
00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:24.730
<v Speaker 1>And the data that we collect well is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that really been established that so</v>

338
00:16:24.771 --> 00:16:28.550
<v Speaker 1>many men prefer soft,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mushy,</v>

339
00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:32.330
<v Speaker 1>hourglass type figures is deposed too</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard bodied women?</v>

340
00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:34.880
<v Speaker 1>How many women are you letting these</v>
<v Speaker 1>blind guys grope?</v>

341
00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:38.290
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are they getting a real study sample to</v>

342
00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:41.330
<v Speaker 1>choose from or like how's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>

343
00:16:41.331 --> 00:16:42.200
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got it.</v>

344
00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:43.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the p the,</v>

345
00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:45.830
<v Speaker 1>the particular data with the congenital</v>
<v Speaker 1>blind men,</v>

346
00:16:45.831 --> 00:16:48.230
<v Speaker 1>I think they only had maybe two or three</v>
<v Speaker 1>mannequins.</v>

347
00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:51.410
<v Speaker 1>Mannequins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute.</v>

348
00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:52.660
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're letting them feel up</v>

349
00:16:52.661 --> 00:16:55.490
<v Speaker 1>mannequins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all the day that I gave you is not</v>

350
00:16:55.491 --> 00:16:56.990
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you're going to attack me mannequin</v>

351
00:16:56.991 --> 00:16:57.650
<v Speaker 1>style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got it.</v>

352
00:16:57.650 --> 00:16:58.251
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about,</v>

353
00:16:58.251 --> 00:16:59.840
<v Speaker 1>can't you bring up strippers?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

354
00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:01.320
<v Speaker 1>how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you have to have a mannequin?</v>

355
00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:05.270
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because probably it might be difficult</v>

356
00:17:05.271 --> 00:17:06.910
<v Speaker 1>to have the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

357
00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:10.280
<v Speaker 1>ethics approval board of universities</v>
<v Speaker 1>have young,</v>

358
00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:14.210
<v Speaker 1>a young blind men or maybe they're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>young feel off a bunch of women.</v>

359
00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:16.550
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ethics board doesn't like science</v>

360
00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:19.880
<v Speaker 1>because you can't just judge what a guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>likes and women by you letting them</v>

361
00:17:19.881 --> 00:17:22.160
<v Speaker 1>touch a doll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's ridiculous.</v>

362
00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:24.080
<v Speaker 1>But let's shit science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

363
00:17:24.081 --> 00:17:29.081
<v Speaker 1>well isn't that look every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every study has some methodological</v>

364
00:17:30.171 --> 00:17:31.004
<v Speaker 1>constraints,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

365
00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:34.710
<v Speaker 1>That one's easy to fix by having real</v>
<v Speaker 1>women being fest.</v>

366
00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:37.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure a lot of women would sign up</v>
<v Speaker 1>for that.</v>

367
00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:38.061
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe.</v>

368
00:17:38.061 --> 00:17:40.040
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why didn't they try that?</v>

369
00:17:40.041 --> 00:17:42.770
<v Speaker 1>That seems so that you can tell by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way that I'm not misspeaking.</v>

370
00:17:42.771 --> 00:17:45.350
<v Speaker 1>I hope that they did use mannequins and</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's find out what's the name of the</v>

371
00:17:45.351 --> 00:17:48.440
<v Speaker 1>study at Jimmy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll look at the 2010 he just do</v>

372
00:17:48.441 --> 00:17:52.230
<v Speaker 1>congenital blind men and waist to hip</v>
<v Speaker 1>ratios and it'll come up.</v>

373
00:17:52.231 --> 00:17:54.390
<v Speaker 1>It'll come up on the Jamie Board of</v>
<v Speaker 1>truth,</v>

374
00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:57.060
<v Speaker 1>the Jamie Bode of truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aka the Internet,</v>

375
00:17:57.090 --> 00:17:57.923
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could,</v>

376
00:17:58.050 --> 00:18:00.380
<v Speaker 1>you could take Fmr,</v>
<v Speaker 1>righ,</v>

377
00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:02.910
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brain imaging studies of men that are</v>

378
00:18:02.911 --> 00:18:07.911
<v Speaker 1>exposed to women of different waist to</v>
<v Speaker 1>hip ratios and their pleasure centers in</v>

379
00:18:08.521 --> 00:18:13.140
<v Speaker 1>their brain light up more when exposed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to women that have that hourglass</v>

380
00:18:13.141 --> 00:18:13.680
<v Speaker 1>figure.</v>

381
00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:16.050
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the data is unassailable because it</v>

382
00:18:16.051 --> 00:18:20.430
<v Speaker 1>comes from multitude of countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>multitude of time periods using</v>

383
00:18:20.431 --> 00:18:22.800
<v Speaker 1>different methods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not denying that men enjoy that.</v>

384
00:18:22.801 --> 00:18:24.960
<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying is that that Saturday</v>
<v Speaker 1>was study.</v>

385
00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:28.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By using hourglass figures on the</v>

386
00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:29.660
<v Speaker 1>mannequins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let me,</v>

387
00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:31.160
<v Speaker 1>let me build on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

388
00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:34.680
<v Speaker 1>I in one of my papers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I looked at sex dolls,</v>

389
00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:36.540
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sex Doll,</v>

390
00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:40.530
<v Speaker 1>convenient money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to look at sex dolls for a paper,</v>

391
00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:42.210
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

392
00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:44.400
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that paper I just went to,</v>

393
00:18:44.401 --> 00:18:46.070
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember the company's name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

394
00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:48.510
<v Speaker 1>it's a real dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably one of those,</v>

395
00:18:48.511 --> 00:18:50.970
<v Speaker 1>was it a like a realistic one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

396
00:18:50.971 --> 00:18:52.830
<v Speaker 1>I didn't get them at home and measured</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

397
00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:57.210
<v Speaker 1>They don't mean one that looks like that</v>
<v Speaker 1>person looks like a person and they</v>

398
00:18:57.211 --> 00:18:59.880
<v Speaker 1>advertise their measurements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

399
00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:02.790
<v Speaker 1>And as you would expect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the average waist to hip,</v>

400
00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:05.760
<v Speaker 1>their hair color changes in their skin</v>
<v Speaker 1>color changes.</v>

401
00:19:05.761 --> 00:19:09.750
<v Speaker 1>But the average waist to hip ratio was</v>
<v Speaker 1>close to that 0.7.</v>

402
00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:12.300
<v Speaker 1>And so here what you're demonstrating is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that marketers,</v>

403
00:19:12.301 --> 00:19:14.010
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys that are producing these</v>

404
00:19:14.011 --> 00:19:17.880
<v Speaker 1>products are producing products that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>aligned with our evolve preferences.</v>

405
00:19:17.881 --> 00:19:20.940
<v Speaker 1>If they didn't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they produced a sex dolls that look</v>

406
00:19:20.941 --> 00:19:24.240
<v Speaker 1>like east German female slash male</v>
<v Speaker 1>swimmers,</v>

407
00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:25.830
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>

408
00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:27.360
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how dare you.</v>

409
00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:29.190
<v Speaker 1>Those are women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

410
00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:32.670
<v Speaker 1>How are we going to get into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>intersex debate from the Olympics?</v>

411
00:19:32.671 --> 00:19:33.504
<v Speaker 1>Is that what we're doing?</v>

412
00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:36.360
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well the Olympics is a fascinating place</v>

413
00:19:36.361 --> 00:19:38.190
<v Speaker 3>to jump off with that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no.</v>

414
00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:40.200
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I think,</v>

415
00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:42.090
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The atomy anatomy of desire,</v>

416
00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.640
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the two mannequins stood side by side,</v>

417
00:19:44.641 --> 00:19:45.091
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

418
00:19:45.091 --> 00:19:47.820
<v Speaker 3>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cargo van mobile vans.</v>

419
00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:48.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

420
00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:49.900
<v Speaker 3>Mannequins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

421
00:19:49.901 --> 00:19:51.900
<v Speaker 3>it's just two mannequins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a shit study.</v>

422
00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:55.920
<v Speaker 3>They could have easily gotten strippers</v>
<v Speaker 3>published in one of the top science</v>

423
00:19:55.921 --> 00:19:56.754
<v Speaker 3>journals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but okay,</v>

424
00:19:57.050 --> 00:19:59.270
<v Speaker 3>well I'm still still publish it all day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

425
00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:01.290
<v Speaker 3>I'm fucking mannequin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would they,</v>

426
00:20:01.291 --> 00:20:02.860
<v Speaker 3>you can get real women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

427
00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:05.200
<v Speaker 3>I'll speak to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only the way that it would be rude.</v>

428
00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:08.400
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even the woman who was like not chosen,</v>

429
00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:09.960
<v Speaker 3>well you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

430
00:20:09.961 --> 00:20:12.090
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some guys might be like in petite,</v>

431
00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:14.370
<v Speaker 3>slim,</v>
<v Speaker 3>slender model type.</v>

432
00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:16.920
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what's interesting to me is that</v>

433
00:20:16.921 --> 00:20:20.700
<v Speaker 3>men aren't really attracted to that</v>
<v Speaker 3>model shape.</v>

434
00:20:20.701 --> 00:20:21.660
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

435
00:20:21.661 --> 00:20:24.870
<v Speaker 3>It's weird cause women oftentimes think</v>
<v Speaker 3>that men are,</v>

436
00:20:24.871 --> 00:20:29.550
<v Speaker 3>because they see these models in these</v>
<v Speaker 3>magazines and I think that does lean</v>

437
00:20:29.551 --> 00:20:33.980
<v Speaker 3>towards the desire for some women to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>into that anorexic state because he's</v>

438
00:20:33.981 --> 00:20:37.380
<v Speaker 3>sort of get this body dysmorphia thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>going on by looking at these,</v>

439
00:20:37.381 --> 00:20:39.600
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost a completely unrealistic to</v>

440
00:20:39.601 --> 00:20:39.900
<v Speaker 3>pictures.</v>

441
00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:42.060
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know people were actually built like</v>

442
00:20:42.061 --> 00:20:43.770
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're extremely rare.</v>

443
00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:45.450
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like knowing someone who's built</v>

444
00:20:45.451 --> 00:20:47.980
<v Speaker 3>like a professional basketball player,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they absolutely exist.</v>

445
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:50.950
<v Speaker 1>But boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good luck finding one on a random day,</v>

446
00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:53.680
<v Speaker 1>finding some seven foot tall super</v>
<v Speaker 1>athlete.</v>

447
00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:54.940
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

448
00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:55.660
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

449
00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:58.450
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's all sorts of differences between</v>

450
00:20:58.451 --> 00:21:01.360
<v Speaker 1>what images that you see sometimes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what people truly prefer.</v>

451
00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:06.130
<v Speaker 1>I think it's really strange how women</v>
<v Speaker 1>always say want to paint it as women</v>

452
00:21:06.131 --> 00:21:09.520
<v Speaker 1>being victimized by these unrealistic</v>
<v Speaker 1>body images.</v>

453
00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:13.080
<v Speaker 1>But you never hear the same from men</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to body builders,</v>

454
00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:15.970
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When men see a guy who's just giant</v>

455
00:21:15.971 --> 00:21:19.840
<v Speaker 1>muscles that had big six pack and just</v>
<v Speaker 1>looks like a stud.</v>

456
00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:25.070
<v Speaker 1>Men never feel like they're being</v>
<v Speaker 1>victimized by these unrealistic body on,</v>

457
00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:27.520
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean most of the guys that you see as</v>

458
00:21:27.521 --> 00:21:30.880
<v Speaker 1>leading men on average tend to be taller</v>
<v Speaker 1>than the norm.</v>

459
00:21:30.881 --> 00:21:33.010
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm being victimized cause I'm a</v>

460
00:21:33.011 --> 00:21:36.280
<v Speaker 1>shorter guy as if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you forgive me for saying as you are,</v>

461
00:21:36.281 --> 00:21:36.490
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

462
00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:38.350
<v Speaker 1>So how come we don't complain about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

463
00:21:38.351 --> 00:21:41.200
<v Speaker 1>short guys and he'd love as well?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or how about social status?</v>

464
00:21:41.201 --> 00:21:42.860
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Typically you see the six,</v>

465
00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:45.910
<v Speaker 1>the depiction say in romance novels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've given this example on previous</v>

466
00:21:45.911 --> 00:21:47.590
<v Speaker 1>occasions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure if I did on your show,</v>

467
00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:49.930
<v Speaker 1>but if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you studied the archetype of</v>

468
00:21:49.931 --> 00:21:52.450
<v Speaker 1>masculinity in a romance novel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll look,</v>

469
00:21:52.451 --> 00:21:53.920
<v Speaker 1>fabio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's long hair.</v>

470
00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:55.000
<v Speaker 1>It's exact same guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

471
00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:57.880
<v Speaker 1>He's tall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's account and he's a neurosurgeon.</v>

472
00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:00.930
<v Speaker 1>He's rough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's reckless in terms of his risk</v>

473
00:22:00.931 --> 00:22:02.860
<v Speaker 1>taking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can only be tamed by the love of this</v>

474
00:22:02.861 --> 00:22:05.500
<v Speaker 1>one woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wrestles alligators on his chest,</v>

475
00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:06.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a six pack,</v>

476
00:22:06.941 --> 00:22:08.890
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's usually not a pear shape.</v>

477
00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:10.300
<v Speaker 1>How many of these books you've read and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

478
00:22:10.301 --> 00:22:12.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm reading them every single day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just read one before I came here.</v>

479
00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:18.090
<v Speaker 1>It looks so deep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the reality is that that you know</v>

480
00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:22.990
<v Speaker 1>the product works because there is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>commonality to what women fantasize</v>

481
00:22:22.991 --> 00:22:23.580
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

482
00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:26.230
<v Speaker 1>And whether she's Romanian or Nigerian</v>
<v Speaker 1>or Japanese,</v>

483
00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:31.800
<v Speaker 1>she likely prefers a high status tall</v>
<v Speaker 1>alpha male to a nasal pear shaped a</v>

484
00:22:33.041 --> 00:22:34.330
<v Speaker 1>wimp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

485
00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:38.080
<v Speaker 1>and so that's how you describe yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How rude I am.</v>

486
00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:40.210
<v Speaker 1>I am the walking Alpha male side.</v>

487
00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:44.290
<v Speaker 1>I could call you son cause you're a bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>younger than me.</v>

488
00:22:44.291 --> 00:22:47.440
<v Speaker 1>We slightly plus I've got gray hair so</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I can get away with that</v>

489
00:22:47.441 --> 00:22:51.250
<v Speaker 1>appellation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But no look up products that work well</v>

490
00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:53.860
<v Speaker 1>are typically those that are congruent</v>
<v Speaker 1>with our human nature.</v>

491
00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:56.020
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those that are not will typically</v>

492
00:22:56.021 --> 00:22:58.510
<v Speaker 1>fail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always wondered why women claim</v>

493
00:22:58.511 --> 00:23:02.710
<v Speaker 1>victim status when they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're being compared to unrealistic</v>

494
00:23:02.711 --> 00:23:06.150
<v Speaker 1>body images,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but men don't because I think that just</v>

495
00:23:06.151 --> 00:23:07.990
<v Speaker 1>kind of relates to social justice</v>
<v Speaker 1>warriors.</v>

496
00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:11.440
<v Speaker 1>I've proposed the theory of Munchhausen</v>
<v Speaker 1>Syndrome.</v>

497
00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:13.810
<v Speaker 1>Have you heard me talk about this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is.</v>

498
00:23:13.811 --> 00:23:15.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so Munchhausen's syndrome for those,</v>

499
00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:17.460
<v Speaker 1>for the viewers who don't know is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

500
00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:22.470
<v Speaker 1>you get sympathy and attention by being</v>
<v Speaker 1>victim and so you feign an illness to</v>

501
00:23:23.711 --> 00:23:27.130
<v Speaker 1>get attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Munchhausen Syndrome by proxy is when</v>

502
00:23:27.131 --> 00:23:31.540
<v Speaker 1>you hurt someone else was in your care,</v>
<v Speaker 1>typically an elderly person or a pet or</v>

503
00:23:31.541 --> 00:23:36.100
<v Speaker 1>typically your biological child because</v>
<v Speaker 1>that will garn you garner you empathy</v>

504
00:23:36.101 --> 00:23:38.320
<v Speaker 1>points at well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then to answer your question,</v>

505
00:23:38.321 --> 00:23:39.070
<v Speaker 1>why do women do that?</v>

506
00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:43.420
<v Speaker 1>Because some women ultimately I trapped</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they sort of big Munchhausen a love</v>

507
00:23:43.421 --> 00:23:47.810
<v Speaker 1>fest where I need to constantly get</v>
<v Speaker 1>reaffirmation and empathy by being the</v>

508
00:23:47.811 --> 00:23:49.970
<v Speaker 1>victim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To the extent that Western women,</v>

509
00:23:50.890 --> 00:23:52.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have been liberated from all of the</v>

510
00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:55.160
<v Speaker 1>typical problems that we see in other</v>
<v Speaker 1>parts of the world.</v>

511
00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:57.770
<v Speaker 1>I've got to look for a new victim</v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative and boom,</v>

512
00:23:57.771 --> 00:23:59.210
<v Speaker 1>that's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

513
00:23:59.211 --> 00:24:03.200
<v Speaker 1>isn't it also though that it is an</v>
<v Speaker 1>unrealistic body shape and that they do</v>

514
00:24:03.201 --> 00:24:07.910
<v Speaker 1>feel it completely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a completely impossible task</v>

515
00:24:07.911 --> 00:24:10.190
<v Speaker 1>for a lot of women who were built like</v>
<v Speaker 1>normal people.</v>

516
00:24:10.191 --> 00:24:14.720
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen the body shapes of a male</v>
<v Speaker 1>superheroes and toys?</v>

517
00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:15.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Mason,</v>

518
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.120
<v Speaker 1>they let me shoot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

519
00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:20.480
<v Speaker 1>They look at you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what about the rest of us that don't</v>

520
00:24:20.481 --> 00:24:22.640
<v Speaker 1>look like you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How come we don't go into a fetal</v>

521
00:24:22.641 --> 00:24:23.090
<v Speaker 1>position?</v>

522
00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:26.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm asking why did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is Munchhausen Syndrome more</v>

523
00:24:26.421 --> 00:24:31.030
<v Speaker 1>apparent in women than it is in men?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Incidentally in the true form of much</v>

524
00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:32.660
<v Speaker 1>housing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of harming a child,</v>

525
00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:34.550
<v Speaker 1>it's usually always the biological</v>
<v Speaker 1>mother.</v>

526
00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:38.570
<v Speaker 1>So you're exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's just a manifestation of that</v>

527
00:24:38.571 --> 00:24:41.510
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon in a new context.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're exactly right.</v>

528
00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:44.240
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I wouldn't have phrased it that way.</v>

529
00:24:44.241 --> 00:24:47.450
<v Speaker 1>I would phrase it more of a term of</v>
<v Speaker 1>frustration then some sort of a</v>

530
00:24:47.451 --> 00:24:49.850
<v Speaker 1>psychological disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would think that women are just</v>

531
00:24:49.851 --> 00:24:53.450
<v Speaker 1>frustrated with this seat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the differences being that if a</v>

532
00:24:53.451 --> 00:24:56.140
<v Speaker 1>woman is large boned or la,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

533
00:24:56.150 --> 00:24:57.920
<v Speaker 1>she has a wide waist or something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

534
00:24:57.921 --> 00:25:01.310
<v Speaker 1>there's very little she can do to try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>achieve that model shape.</v>

535
00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:03.920
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if a man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

536
00:25:03.921 --> 00:25:07.130
<v Speaker 1>is slight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can lift weights and you know,</v>

537
00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:10.580
<v Speaker 1>eat a lot of food and go get a personal</v>
<v Speaker 1>trainer and do a lot of squats and dead</v>

538
00:25:10.581 --> 00:25:12.650
<v Speaker 1>lifts and build his body up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

539
00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:15.410
<v Speaker 1>Like a man can make his body look more</v>
<v Speaker 1>masculine.</v>

540
00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:20.210
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult outside of surgery</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a woman to change the shape of her</v>

541
00:25:20.211 --> 00:25:22.400
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She can get in shape and if she's</v>

542
00:25:22.401 --> 00:25:25.070
<v Speaker 1>overweight she can diminish that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She can lose some fat.</v>

543
00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:25.911
<v Speaker 1>She can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

544
00:25:25.911 --> 00:25:28.300
<v Speaker 1>put some meat on her butt and her legs</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

545
00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:31.340
<v Speaker 1>but she can't like grow breasts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

546
00:25:31.341 --> 00:25:33.740
<v Speaker 1>she can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she can't do anything that would make</v>

547
00:25:33.741 --> 00:25:37.070
<v Speaker 1>her appear more outwardly feminine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

548
00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:40.130
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that exactly speaks to some of the</v>

549
00:25:40.131 --> 00:25:43.370
<v Speaker 1>antipathy that people feel towards</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary psychology.</v>

550
00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:44.481
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hit the,</v>

551
00:25:44.481 --> 00:25:49.481
<v Speaker 1>the nail the nail on the head yet</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there is wrongly saw,</v>

552
00:25:49.981 --> 00:25:53.660
<v Speaker 1>there's this idea that evolutionary</v>
<v Speaker 1>theories sort of biological determinism,</v>

553
00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:56.840
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If people prefer facially symmetric</v>

554
00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:59.420
<v Speaker 1>faces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if my face is not facially</v>

555
00:25:59.421 --> 00:26:03.110
<v Speaker 1>symmetric,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I'm doomed to a life of twiddling</v>

556
00:26:03.111 --> 00:26:04.700
<v Speaker 1>my thumbs and the life of celibacy.</v>

557
00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:07.220
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why there's this narrative</v>

558
00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:10.120
<v Speaker 1>that became famous with Naomi Wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what,</v>

559
00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:11.320
<v Speaker 1>do you know who that is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

560
00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:13.970
<v Speaker 1>she wrote a book that sold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many millions of copies</v>

561
00:26:13.971 --> 00:26:16.940
<v Speaker 1>called the beauty myth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I actually critique.</v>

562
00:26:16.941 --> 00:26:20.960
<v Speaker 1>And my first book I talked about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>myth about the beauty myth and the</v>

563
00:26:20.961 --> 00:26:22.160
<v Speaker 1>beauty myth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically she,</v>

564
00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:26.810
<v Speaker 1>she provides it this liberatory argument</v>
<v Speaker 1>against these beauty standards.</v>

565
00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:29.270
<v Speaker 1>And here's her argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I will sort of summarize very</v>

566
00:26:29.271 --> 00:26:30.650
<v Speaker 1>quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She basically says,</v>

567
00:26:30.651 --> 00:26:33.020
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women are now winning in every facet of</v>

568
00:26:33.021 --> 00:26:36.830
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the only place that men can still</v>

569
00:26:36.831 --> 00:26:39.950
<v Speaker 1>cause harm to women that they could</v>
<v Speaker 1>still dominate women.</v>

570
00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:43.440
<v Speaker 1>And this is going to speak to one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>points that you raised is by creating</v>

571
00:26:43.441 --> 00:26:44.190
<v Speaker 1>this false</v>

572
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:48.000
<v Speaker 4>narrative about the types of women that</v>
<v Speaker 4>men prefer.</v>

573
00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:52.350
<v Speaker 4>And by pushing this narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it makes women feel insecure about</v>

574
00:26:52.351 --> 00:26:53.610
<v Speaker 4>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

575
00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:56.730
<v Speaker 4>hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's so her proposal is that the only</v>

576
00:26:56.731 --> 00:26:59.160
<v Speaker 4>reason that this exists is because men</v>
<v Speaker 4>are trying to harm women.</v>

577
00:26:59.161 --> 00:27:02.430
<v Speaker 4>It's a conspiratorial theory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's hilarious.</v>

578
00:27:02.431 --> 00:27:04.170
<v Speaker 4>She must be a lot of fun to hang out</v>
<v Speaker 4>with.</v>

579
00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:06.090
<v Speaker 4>She's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's still alive.</v>

580
00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:06.711
<v Speaker 4>She's alive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

581
00:27:06.711 --> 00:27:07.440
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's,</v>

582
00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:09.810
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's reasonably young and still very</v>

583
00:27:09.811 --> 00:27:11.070
<v Speaker 4>productive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

584
00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:12.270
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

585
00:27:12.271 --> 00:27:12.780
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>

586
00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:16.260
<v Speaker 4>it's a message that sells because if I</v>
<v Speaker 4>am a unattractive,</v>

587
00:27:16.261 --> 00:27:18.180
<v Speaker 4>if genetically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

588
00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:21.870
<v Speaker 4>I don't score well on some of these</v>
<v Speaker 4>universal metrics of beauty,</v>

589
00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:24.600
<v Speaker 4>I would much rather hear a story that</v>
<v Speaker 4>basically says,</v>

590
00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:27.480
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's all due to arbitrary construction</v>

591
00:27:27.481 --> 00:27:28.800
<v Speaker 4>of beauty standards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>

592
00:27:28.801 --> 00:27:30.990
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing innate about these.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

593
00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:36.680
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a lot of women that are</v>
<v Speaker 4>very intelligent that run into asshole</v>

594
00:27:36.691 --> 00:27:41.460
<v Speaker 4>men so many times that they developed</v>
<v Speaker 4>this distorted perception of what a man</v>

595
00:27:41.461 --> 00:27:41.790
<v Speaker 4>is.</v>

596
00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:45.060
<v Speaker 4>And so they can formulate this theory</v>
<v Speaker 4>and feel justified in doing so.</v>

597
00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:49.260
<v Speaker 4>Is it just ran into so many weak bitches</v>
<v Speaker 4>out there that they start thinking that</v>

598
00:27:49.261 --> 00:27:50.650
<v Speaker 4>all men are trying to harm them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

599
00:27:50.730 --> 00:27:52.350
<v Speaker 4>And all men are trying to hurt their</v>
<v Speaker 4>feelings.</v>

600
00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:53.760
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that this,</v>

601
00:27:53.761 --> 00:27:57.360
<v Speaker 4>this theory is valid in her eyes because</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's based on the anecdotal evidence</v>

602
00:27:57.361 --> 00:27:59.790
<v Speaker 4>that she's acquired through her whole</v>
<v Speaker 4>life of running it.</v>

603
00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:01.320
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously she's very intelligent.</v>

604
00:28:01.321 --> 00:28:04.230
<v Speaker 4>She's writing books.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's probably far more intelligent than</v>

605
00:28:04.231 --> 00:28:05.970
<v Speaker 4>most of the men she's coming in contact</v>
<v Speaker 4>with.</v>

606
00:28:05.971 --> 00:28:10.160
<v Speaker 4>And so she's formulated this theory</v>
<v Speaker 4>based on her own personal evidence,</v>

607
00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:11.720
<v Speaker 4>protect her own ego or you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

608
00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:14.970
<v Speaker 4>but there's direct,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a direct connection.</v>

609
00:28:14.971 --> 00:28:18.930
<v Speaker 4>Like as a man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is a huge difference in how you,</v>

610
00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:22.320
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you react how your body feels when</v>

611
00:28:22.321 --> 00:28:24.630
<v Speaker 4>you're around a classically attractive</v>
<v Speaker 4>woman.</v>

612
00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:30.020
<v Speaker 4>Like let's classkick attractive like</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sofia wren in her prime,</v>

613
00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:32.910
<v Speaker 4>like when you're around it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'd just go,</v>

614
00:28:32.911 --> 00:28:34.980
<v Speaker 4>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like your hands would get sweaty,</v>

615
00:28:34.981 --> 00:28:37.020
<v Speaker 4>your heart would start beating it start</v>
<v Speaker 4>freaking out.</v>

616
00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:41.790
<v Speaker 4>It is 100% natural and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no like,</v>

617
00:28:41.791 --> 00:28:44.430
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh I want to enforce this because it</v>

618
00:28:44.431 --> 00:28:46.620
<v Speaker 4>will make other women feel like shit</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>

619
00:28:46.621 --> 00:28:51.120
<v Speaker 4>That is not it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is a real genetic propensity and</v>

620
00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:55.470
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't it seem as though that should</v>
<v Speaker 4>be so trivially the now to accept,</v>

621
00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:56.393
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's,</v>

622
00:28:56.460 --> 00:29:00.270
<v Speaker 4>but it's not for someone who's an</v>
<v Speaker 4>empowered woman who doesn't see any way</v>

623
00:29:00.271 --> 00:29:02.130
<v Speaker 4>of achieving the right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you don't,</v>

624
00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:06.490
<v Speaker 4>it's like a man could do steroids and</v>
<v Speaker 4>live weights and become a giant body</v>

625
00:29:06.491 --> 00:29:08.340
<v Speaker 4>builder type dude if that's what he was</v>
<v Speaker 4>really into.</v>

626
00:29:08.341 --> 00:29:11.040
<v Speaker 4>And you could achieve that through time</v>
<v Speaker 4>and effort,</v>

627
00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:11.993
<v Speaker 4>but it can be done.</v>

628
00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:15.150
<v Speaker 4>But for a woman to look like one of</v>
<v Speaker 4>those women,</v>

629
00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:18.000
<v Speaker 4>it's impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you are not built like that,</v>

630
00:29:18.001 --> 00:29:20.370
<v Speaker 4>you are not built like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's how it goes.</v>

631
00:29:20.371 --> 00:29:23.190
<v Speaker 4>So I'll tell you a quick story that I</v>
<v Speaker 4>discussed in one of my other books.</v>

632
00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:26.940
<v Speaker 4>It was a documentary that I had watched</v>
<v Speaker 4>on speed dating.</v>

633
00:29:26.941 --> 00:29:29.520
<v Speaker 4>I think it was where there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

634
00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:32.340
<v Speaker 4>profoundly overweight woman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

635
00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:36.090
<v Speaker 4>500 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was basically arguing that,</v>

636
00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:39.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's unfair that all these men at this</v>

637
00:29:39.481 --> 00:29:43.150
<v Speaker 4>speed dating event are not paying closer</v>
<v Speaker 4>attention to her.</v>

638
00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:44.193
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's fair.</v>

639
00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:46.420
<v Speaker 4>It's unfair because they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've been taught,</v>

640
00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:50.770
<v Speaker 4>they've to internalize all these</v>
<v Speaker 4>arbitrary sexist standards of beauty.</v>

641
00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:53.460
<v Speaker 4>So she was really sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

642
00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:54.280
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

643
00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:57.580
<v Speaker 4>but listen to this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So on the one hand if you're unattracted</v>

644
00:29:57.590 --> 00:30:02.410
<v Speaker 4>to an overly overtly overweight woman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you are a fattest.</v>

645
00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:05.710
<v Speaker 4>But on the other hand doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the other side of the coin.</v>

646
00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:11.280
<v Speaker 4>If you prefer very overweight women,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then there's the narrative that you are</v>

647
00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:15.440
<v Speaker 4>fetishizing our,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

648
00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:19.300
<v Speaker 4>access meat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you prefer an overweight woman,</v>

649
00:30:19.390 --> 00:30:23.050
<v Speaker 4>you're a bad guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you this slight overweight women,</v>

650
00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:26.380
<v Speaker 4>you're a fat that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's no state of the world where</v>

651
00:30:26.381 --> 00:30:28.630
<v Speaker 4>someone won't accuse you of being an</v>
<v Speaker 4>asshole.</v>

652
00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:30.130
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the world we live in.</v>

653
00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:34.300
<v Speaker 4>Well isn't that just the world of just</v>
<v Speaker 4>so many different people with varied</v>

654
00:30:34.301 --> 00:30:37.210
<v Speaker 4>opinions that are trying to justify</v>
<v Speaker 4>their own physical condition?</v>

655
00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:37.920
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>

656
00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:39.940
<v Speaker 4>and that's really what it means.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have Fragile Egos.</v>

657
00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:43.150
<v Speaker 4>Well there's a new study that they put</v>
<v Speaker 4>out recently about the,</v>

658
00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:48.600
<v Speaker 4>the myth of healthy obesity because I've</v>
<v Speaker 4>ever seen that read many times.</v>

659
00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:53.110
<v Speaker 4>Or I've read that rather many times</v>
<v Speaker 4>where people are trying to justify their</v>

660
00:30:53.111 --> 00:30:56.920
<v Speaker 4>own obesity by saying that there's this</v>
<v Speaker 4>distorted perception of whether or not</v>

661
00:30:56.921 --> 00:30:59.410
<v Speaker 4>people are healthy because they are</v>
<v Speaker 4>thin.</v>

662
00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:02.020
<v Speaker 4>And then in fact there are some</v>
<v Speaker 4>diseases.</v>

663
00:31:02.021 --> 00:31:04.780
<v Speaker 4>And this is kind of true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's some sort of a weird contradiction.</v>

664
00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:08.610
<v Speaker 4>There's some sort of diseases where</v>
<v Speaker 4>people actually do better if they</v>

665
00:31:08.650 --> 00:31:12.250
<v Speaker 4>recover because they're overweight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the reason for that is not because</v>

666
00:31:12.251 --> 00:31:14.920
<v Speaker 4>being overweight is healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The reason for that is there's a lot of</v>

667
00:31:14.921 --> 00:31:18.820
<v Speaker 4>diseases where you don't take in any</v>
<v Speaker 4>nutrients while you're sick and so your</v>

668
00:31:18.821 --> 00:31:23.170
<v Speaker 4>body goes into a state of ketosis where</v>
<v Speaker 4>it starts burning fat and you're better</v>

669
00:31:23.171 --> 00:31:27.670
<v Speaker 4>off using that fat for fuel if you are</v>
<v Speaker 4>overweight than if you are a very lean</v>

670
00:31:27.671 --> 00:31:31.380
<v Speaker 4>person was no fat to burn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then your body starts burning off a</v>

671
00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:34.470
<v Speaker 4>tissue muscle tissue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is much less healthy for you and</v>

672
00:31:34.471 --> 00:31:36.070
<v Speaker 4>much more dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Incidentally,</v>

673
00:31:36.071 --> 00:31:37.380
<v Speaker 4>what you said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

674
00:31:37.510 --> 00:31:42.190
<v Speaker 4>there's I think now a movement to start</v>
<v Speaker 4>fattest studies at universities.</v>

675
00:31:42.191 --> 00:31:44.800
<v Speaker 4>You know how you have women's studies</v>
<v Speaker 4>and peace studies.</v>

676
00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:48.790
<v Speaker 4>So fat to studies in the heart of is</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly what you led off with,</v>

677
00:31:48.791 --> 00:31:52.780
<v Speaker 4>which is the idea that there's this kind</v>
<v Speaker 4>of medical conspiracy that's pushing a</v>

678
00:31:52.781 --> 00:31:56.860
<v Speaker 4>false narrative that basically says</v>
<v Speaker 4>being overweight as a bad thing,</v>

679
00:31:56.980 --> 00:31:59.020
<v Speaker 4>when in reality there is no such</v>
<v Speaker 4>evidence.</v>

680
00:31:59.390 --> 00:32:01.350
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's evidence of,</v>

681
00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:02.650
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sorry folks,</v>

682
00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:04.140
<v Speaker 4>pull up that study.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>

683
00:32:04.141 --> 00:32:05.920
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really kind of interesting because</v>

684
00:32:05.921 --> 00:32:09.010
<v Speaker 4>it's so black and white.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's just really no arguing about it.</v>

685
00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:11.170
<v Speaker 4>Fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not good to overeat.</v>

686
00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:13.870
<v Speaker 4>It's just not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not good to tax your body,</v>

687
00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:15.940
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>having a little bit of fat.</v>

688
00:32:15.941 --> 00:32:18.670
<v Speaker 4>It's not that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Studies suggest healthy obesity might</v>

689
00:32:18.671 --> 00:32:20.410
<v Speaker 4>just be a meth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

690
00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:24.310
<v Speaker 4>suggested vigorous health interventions</v>
<v Speaker 4>may be necessary for all obese</v>

691
00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:25.770
<v Speaker 4>individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

692
00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:27.520
<v Speaker 4>that's a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There you go.</v>

693
00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:29.110
<v Speaker 4>But everybody knows that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

694
00:32:29.111 --> 00:32:31.930
<v Speaker 4>that that's why you see that fat woman</v>
<v Speaker 4>and people get repulsed.</v>

695
00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:35.170
<v Speaker 4>It's not because they're mean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's because it's not because they're</v>

696
00:32:35.171 --> 00:32:38.290
<v Speaker 4>taught to think that that's not an</v>
<v Speaker 4>objective standard of beauty.</v>

697
00:32:38.291 --> 00:32:40.070
<v Speaker 4>It's just you see someone fat and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>go,</v>

698
00:32:40.071 --> 00:32:41.480
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a mess.</v>

699
00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:43.760
<v Speaker 4>It's a mess.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is someone who's must be</v>

700
00:32:43.761 --> 00:32:45.740
<v Speaker 4>emotionally fragile because they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

701
00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:49.430
<v Speaker 4>They're throwing food down their face.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They clearly have an addiction to sugar</v>

702
00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:52.040
<v Speaker 4>or too simple carbs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

703
00:32:52.041 --> 00:32:52.491
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

704
00:32:52.491 --> 00:32:55.820
<v Speaker 4>they're definitely trying to make up for</v>
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

705
00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:57.133
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's this,</v>

706
00:32:57.260 --> 00:32:59.900
<v Speaker 4>this idea that people are just naturally</v>
<v Speaker 4>more fat.</v>

707
00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:02.000
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not true because if you look at</v>

708
00:33:02.001 --> 00:33:05.060
<v Speaker 4>their diet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's almost always in support of</v>

709
00:33:05.061 --> 00:33:08.480
<v Speaker 4>maintaining a giant body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

710
00:33:08.481 --> 00:33:11.150
<v Speaker 4>that's this idea that some people can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

711
00:33:11.151 --> 00:33:14.990
<v Speaker 4>there are people that have hummingbird</v>
<v Speaker 4>type metabolisms and they can eat ding</v>

712
00:33:14.991 --> 00:33:17.270
<v Speaker 4>dongs all day and still weigh 90 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

713
00:33:17.271 --> 00:33:19.460
<v Speaker 4>that's a freak there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a rare,</v>

714
00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:21.050
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my sister was like that.</v>

715
00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:23.630
<v Speaker 4>My sister's tiny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Her nickname's peewee,</v>

716
00:33:23.631 --> 00:33:25.400
<v Speaker 4>that's what I call her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when we were kids,</v>

717
00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:26.810
<v Speaker 4>she was always,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

718
00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:28.070
<v Speaker 4>she always weighed like a hundred</v>
<v Speaker 4>pounds.</v>

719
00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:29.480
<v Speaker 4>She could fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eat anything.</v>

720
00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:32.660
<v Speaker 4>She could trank she could have a steak,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she could eat ice cream,</v>

721
00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:34.280
<v Speaker 4>90 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

722
00:33:34.281 --> 00:33:35.510
<v Speaker 4>that's just what she weighed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or,</v>

723
00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:36.890
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe I'm exaggerating,</v>

724
00:33:36.891 --> 00:33:38.690
<v Speaker 4>she might weigh 105,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know what I'm saying?</v>

725
00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:43.390
<v Speaker 4>Like she just had that crazy metabolism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just the way it is now.</v>

726
00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:45.090
<v Speaker 4>But that's super unusual,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

727
00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:46.910
<v Speaker 4>For most people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you overeat.</v>

728
00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:50.420
<v Speaker 4>I've posted a few photos on social media</v>
<v Speaker 4>of yourself,</v>

729
00:33:50.421 --> 00:33:52.460
<v Speaker 4>myself at 1985.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Actually,</v>

730
00:33:52.461 --> 00:33:54.770
<v Speaker 4>that was the first time that I've come</v>
<v Speaker 4>to California to visit my brother.</v>

731
00:33:54.771 --> 00:33:57.380
<v Speaker 4>And your soccer players Subtler,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

732
00:33:57.410 --> 00:34:01.160
<v Speaker 4>four or 5% body fat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And of course I said you really get it</v>

733
00:34:01.161 --> 00:34:02.240
<v Speaker 4>checked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did get a check.</v>

734
00:34:02.241 --> 00:34:03.140
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But Calipers,</v>

735
00:34:03.141 --> 00:34:03.440
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

736
00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:06.590
<v Speaker 4>Pri Calipers and the electric</v>
<v Speaker 4>conductivity tests.</v>

737
00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:08.060
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the electric thing sucks.</v>

738
00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:11.840
<v Speaker 4>I've done that electric thing before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was an in real ways submerging,</v>

739
00:34:11.870 --> 00:34:16.310
<v Speaker 4>submerging the electric thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Apparently if you're dehydrated it can</v>

740
00:34:16.311 --> 00:34:18.110
<v Speaker 4>be off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of like very fat cause</v>

741
00:34:18.111 --> 00:34:18.950
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

742
00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:21.860
<v Speaker 4>a lot of it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I might be using a bad one,</v>

743
00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:24.860
<v Speaker 4>but the one of them using was a one in a</v>
<v Speaker 4>doctor's office,</v>

744
00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:28.370
<v Speaker 4>but he was even explaining to me that it</v>
<v Speaker 4>can easily be off if you,</v>

745
00:34:28.371 --> 00:34:29.121
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have,</v>

746
00:34:29.121 --> 00:34:31.650
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're dehydrated and there's very</v>

747
00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:34.020
<v Speaker 4>various factors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever the number was,</v>

748
00:34:34.110 --> 00:34:36.700
<v Speaker 4>was very low.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this was 85,</v>

749
00:34:36.701 --> 00:34:38.780
<v Speaker 4>so this is almost 30,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well more than 30 years ago.</v>

750
00:34:39.170 --> 00:34:41.870
<v Speaker 4>And until up til about my early</v>
<v Speaker 4>twenties,</v>

751
00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:42.740
<v Speaker 4>22,</v>
<v Speaker 4>23,</v>

752
00:34:42.741 --> 00:34:45.200
<v Speaker 4>24,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was always grossly underweight.</v>

753
00:34:45.770 --> 00:34:48.410
<v Speaker 4>The day that I stopped being a serious</v>
<v Speaker 4>athlete,</v>

754
00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:49.850
<v Speaker 4>it just snuck up on me.</v>

755
00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:51.500
<v Speaker 4>Every single,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a coincidence.</v>

756
00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:52.820
<v Speaker 4>That's all that is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You think so?</v>

757
00:34:52.910 --> 00:34:53.743
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

758
00:34:53.810 --> 00:34:56.270
<v Speaker 4>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't pick up on the sarcasm.</v>

759
00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:58.231
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

760
00:34:58.231 --> 00:35:02.180
<v Speaker 4>it's very insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is society's standards that they're</v>

761
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:03.790
<v Speaker 4>enforcing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I knew God,</v>

762
00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:06.320
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Venture of these assholes.</v>

763
00:35:06.321 --> 00:35:09.050
<v Speaker 4>What it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is a bench of men who want you to feel</v>

764
00:35:09.051 --> 00:35:10.730
<v Speaker 4>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

765
00:35:10.850 --> 00:35:11.541
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

766
00:35:11.541 --> 00:35:12.374
<v Speaker 4>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

767
00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:14.450
<v Speaker 4>they let you eat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There you go.</v>

768
00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:14.961
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

769
00:35:14.961 --> 00:35:16.940
<v Speaker 4>Just fucking run every day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'll lose a ton of weight.</v>

770
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:18.920
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>

771
00:35:18.921 --> 00:35:21.230
<v Speaker 4>that's not enough because I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>believe it or not,</v>

772
00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:24.410
<v Speaker 4>I trained a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only way I lose weight as if I'm</v>

773
00:35:24.411 --> 00:35:26.090
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very careful about what I eat.</v>

774
00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:28.250
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she thought that I never lose weight.</v>

775
00:35:28.610 --> 00:35:30.830
<v Speaker 4>But you're a smart guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why do you allow yourself to get</v>

776
00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:32.840
<v Speaker 4>overweight?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh boy.</v>

777
00:35:32.841 --> 00:35:35.540
<v Speaker 4>We're going to get into this now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

778
00:35:35.541 --> 00:35:36.500
<v Speaker 4>this is a subject,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

779
00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:37.140
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

780
00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:38.010
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

781
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:39.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's related to your</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence because,</v>

782
00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:40.501
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it must be,</v>

783
00:35:40.501 --> 00:35:40.801
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

784
00:35:40.801 --> 00:35:42.300
<v Speaker 1>let me give you an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

785
00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:43.810
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll,</v>

786
00:35:43.810 --> 00:35:45.720
<v Speaker 1>we'll just so quick to dismiss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is an issue,</v>

787
00:35:45.721 --> 00:35:47.640
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You walked into a physician's office</v>

788
00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:51.080
<v Speaker 1>when I had severe bronchitis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

789
00:35:51.110 --> 00:35:55.740
<v Speaker 1>he was I think a pulmonologist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was chain smoking in his office.</v>

790
00:35:56.070 --> 00:35:58.980
<v Speaker 1>Now is that because he was an idiot who</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't understand the yes.</v>

791
00:35:59.430 --> 00:36:00.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's an idiot if he's changed,</v>

792
00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:03.810
<v Speaker 1>but it's an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not correlated to his Iq.</v>

793
00:36:03.811 --> 00:36:04.411
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

794
00:36:04.411 --> 00:36:08.970
<v Speaker 1>it's correlated to his objective</v>
<v Speaker 1>assessment of what is intelligent to do</v>

795
00:36:08.971 --> 00:36:12.090
<v Speaker 1>with your meat vehicle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy is stupid.</v>

796
00:36:12.091 --> 00:36:14.490
<v Speaker 1>If he smoked cigarettes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is a stupid thing to do.</v>

797
00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:17.160
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that he can't be</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent in other areas of his life,</v>

798
00:36:17.161 --> 00:36:21.930
<v Speaker 1>but he's most certainly shutting down or</v>
<v Speaker 1>ignoring some really clear information</v>

799
00:36:21.931 --> 00:36:24.360
<v Speaker 1>that we have been given for the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

800
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:25.860
<v Speaker 1>50 plus years.</v>

801
00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:28.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think actually what you're,</v>

802
00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:31.290
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about speaks to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>point that I reason some of my writings,</v>

803
00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:36.060
<v Speaker 1>the idea of whether we make choices</v>
<v Speaker 1>simply because we don't have the right</v>

804
00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:40.080
<v Speaker 1>information to make better choices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's usually the typical argument that</v>

805
00:36:40.081 --> 00:36:42.840
<v Speaker 1>public policy makers use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that basically say,</v>

806
00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:43.913
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

807
00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:45.570
<v Speaker 1>if you're engaging in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

808
00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:46.540
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

809
00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:48.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>risky sexual behavior,</v>

810
00:36:48.421 --> 00:36:50.490
<v Speaker 1>or if you're engaging in a sedentary</v>
<v Speaker 1>lifestyle,</v>

811
00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:53.550
<v Speaker 1>it's because you don't know any better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's set up public service</v>

812
00:36:53.551 --> 00:36:56.610
<v Speaker 1>announcements that teach you a better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then hopefully people will act</v>

813
00:36:56.611 --> 00:36:58.870
<v Speaker 1>better and that doesn't actually work so</v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

814
00:36:58.871 --> 00:37:01.640
<v Speaker 1>So the issue is not so much that people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

815
00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:06.600
<v Speaker 1>it's not as though I don't know that</v>
<v Speaker 1>being overweight is a bad thing.</v>

816
00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:09.720
<v Speaker 1>And now that you've taught me better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will now change my behavior.</v>

817
00:37:10.290 --> 00:37:13.440
<v Speaker 1>The problem stems from the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are these Darwinian pools that</v>

818
00:37:13.441 --> 00:37:16.590
<v Speaker 1>make it difficult for us to extricate</v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves quite.</v>

819
00:37:16.590 --> 00:37:18.960
<v Speaker 1>Whether it be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you're addicted to drugs because</v>

820
00:37:18.961 --> 00:37:21.240
<v Speaker 1>it tickles your pleasure center in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain,</v>

821
00:37:21.241 --> 00:37:23.190
<v Speaker 1>or whether it be because you addicted to</v>
<v Speaker 1>sex,</v>

822
00:37:23.191 --> 00:37:26.370
<v Speaker 1>or whether you're addicted to a bit more</v>
<v Speaker 1>food than you should be eating.</v>

823
00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:28.860
<v Speaker 1>Those are the Darwinian pools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

824
00:37:28.861 --> 00:37:32.370
<v Speaker 1>Poles that make it difficult for us to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do the optimal decision.</v>

825
00:37:32.371 --> 00:37:34.920
<v Speaker 1>It's not because we're too dumb to know</v>
<v Speaker 1>better or we don't have the right</v>

826
00:37:34.921 --> 00:37:35.620
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you,</v>

827
00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:36.141
<v Speaker 1>William,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

828
00:37:36.141 --> 00:37:38.100
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about food now,</v>

829
00:37:38.101 --> 00:37:40.530
<v Speaker 1>not the cigarettes that this doctor was</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoking,</v>

830
00:37:40.531 --> 00:37:43.890
<v Speaker 1>that you were using it as an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not the best one because there's</v>

831
00:37:43.891 --> 00:37:46.740
<v Speaker 1>no Darwinian pool towards smoking</v>
<v Speaker 1>satellites.</v>

832
00:37:47.310 --> 00:37:48.180
<v Speaker 1>Forget,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forget the,</v>

833
00:37:48.210 --> 00:37:49.890
<v Speaker 1>the nicotine example of what I just</v>
<v Speaker 1>said.</v>

834
00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:53.970
<v Speaker 1>In general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we make poor decisions that lead to</v>

835
00:37:53.971 --> 00:37:57.390
<v Speaker 1>deleterious health outcomes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not because we don't know any</v>

836
00:37:57.391 --> 00:37:59.550
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's go back to this suntanning</v>

837
00:37:59.551 --> 00:38:00.384
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>

838
00:38:00.450 --> 00:38:05.450
<v Speaker 1>Women know more about the deleterious</v>
<v Speaker 1>effects of sun exposure than men do yet</v>

839
00:38:06.361 --> 00:38:09.060
<v Speaker 1>they do with more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it were only a question of,</v>

840
00:38:09.330 --> 00:38:10.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because I don't know any better</v>

841
00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:12.450
<v Speaker 1>than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we wouldn't expect women to be doing it</v>

842
00:38:12.451 --> 00:38:14.280
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not a question of not having the</v>

843
00:38:14.281 --> 00:38:16.620
<v Speaker 1>right information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's whether ultimately you have the</v>

844
00:38:16.621 --> 00:38:19.230
<v Speaker 1>control to not succumb to these polls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

845
00:38:19.231 --> 00:38:22.380
<v Speaker 1>we've got the seven deadly sins since,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

846
00:38:22.410 --> 00:38:26.250
<v Speaker 1>since for thousands of years precisely</v>
<v Speaker 1>because very smart people understood</v>

847
00:38:26.251 --> 00:38:28.950
<v Speaker 1>that these are some traps that we all</v>
<v Speaker 1>succumb to,</v>

848
00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:32.610
<v Speaker 1>whether it be greed or lust or gluttony.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my case,</v>

849
00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:34.980
<v Speaker 1>I've never smoked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never drank.</v>

850
00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:35.530
<v Speaker 1>But very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

851
00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:36.363
<v Speaker 1>an elite.</v>

852
00:38:36.730 --> 00:38:39.540
<v Speaker 3>My problem is I guess gluttony.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a gluttonous.</v>

853
00:38:39.541 --> 00:38:42.490
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when you say have the control,</v>

854
00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:45.340
<v Speaker 3>like what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what steps have you ever taken to</v>

855
00:38:45.341 --> 00:38:46.600
<v Speaker 3>acquire the control?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

856
00:38:46.601 --> 00:38:48.880
<v Speaker 3>do you practice mindfulness?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you meditate?</v>

857
00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:52.810
<v Speaker 3>Do you write down your goals?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you write down like what you eat and</v>

858
00:38:52.811 --> 00:38:53.500
<v Speaker 3>what your cow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

859
00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:56.860
<v Speaker 3>have you ever gone to a doctor and found</v>
<v Speaker 3>out what your calorie consumption should</v>

860
00:38:56.861 --> 00:38:59.380
<v Speaker 3>be?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever tried to alter your diet</v>

861
00:38:59.381 --> 00:39:02.770
<v Speaker 3>and maybe go on a fat burning diet</v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of on a carbohydrate burning</v>

862
00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:04.510
<v Speaker 3>diet?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not the mindfulness,</v>

863
00:39:04.511 --> 00:39:07.150
<v Speaker 3>but all the other stuff that you've done</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a fat burning diet instead of</v>

864
00:39:07.151 --> 00:39:08.800
<v Speaker 3>carbohydrates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

865
00:39:08.850 --> 00:39:13.270
<v Speaker 3>So what have you done for them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when I do it [inaudible] you'll see</v>

866
00:39:13.271 --> 00:39:16.480
<v Speaker 3>me in three months,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll be 35 pounds lighter and you won't</v>

867
00:39:16.481 --> 00:39:18.900
<v Speaker 3>believe in what have you done?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what pro?</v>

868
00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:24.340
<v Speaker 3>So I just do a heavy protein dive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>minimal carbs with a lot of vegetables,</v>

869
00:39:24.370 --> 00:39:25.203
<v Speaker 3>so upbeat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

870
00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:27.170
<v Speaker 3>six ounce steak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

871
00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:30.550
<v Speaker 3>with Broccoli and whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that with the tomato</v>

872
00:39:30.551 --> 00:39:31.460
<v Speaker 3>juice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

873
00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:34.060
<v Speaker 3>and that I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll loose kind of like the,</v>

874
00:39:34.061 --> 00:39:35.980
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well not the Atkins in the sense that</v>

875
00:39:35.981 --> 00:39:40.000
<v Speaker 3>you'd eat as much fat as you want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's really a lot of protein and a</v>

876
00:39:40.001 --> 00:39:41.050
<v Speaker 3>lot of vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

877
00:39:41.051 --> 00:39:44.920
<v Speaker 3>honestly the Atkins is when you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying eat as much fat as you want</v>

878
00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:46.690
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is actually the trend.</v>

879
00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:50.950
<v Speaker 3>The trend is towards a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a ketogenic diet when he talking about</v>

880
00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:54.460
<v Speaker 3>getting your body to burn fat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of athletes are getting involved</v>

881
00:39:54.461 --> 00:39:58.180
<v Speaker 3>in getting on fat burning diets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I actually switched my own diet to</v>

882
00:39:58.181 --> 00:39:59.610
<v Speaker 3>that where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

883
00:39:59.611 --> 00:40:01.930
<v Speaker 3>it didn't really have a problem being</v>
<v Speaker 3>overweight,</v>

884
00:40:02.170 --> 00:40:05.410
<v Speaker 3>but I was definitely heavier and I had</v>
<v Speaker 3>more body fat than I have now.</v>

885
00:40:05.650 --> 00:40:07.740
<v Speaker 3>And what I did was I switched over to</v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

886
00:40:07.741 --> 00:40:09.250
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a guy named Mark Sisson who was</v>

887
00:40:09.251 --> 00:40:11.050
<v Speaker 3>on my podcast before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

888
00:40:11.110 --> 00:40:13.150
<v Speaker 3>and he wrote this book called the primal</v>
<v Speaker 3>blueprint.</v>

889
00:40:13.570 --> 00:40:14.350
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

890
00:40:14.350 --> 00:40:19.350
<v Speaker 3>it's the idea behind it is that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're eating a lot of simple carbs</v>

891
00:40:19.690 --> 00:40:22.630
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of pastas and breads,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're getting insulin spikes,</v>

892
00:40:22.631 --> 00:40:26.230
<v Speaker 3>your body's processing all that sugar</v>
<v Speaker 3>and your body stores it and your body</v>

893
00:40:26.231 --> 00:40:29.290
<v Speaker 3>starts burning sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas if you can get your body to a</v>

894
00:40:29.291 --> 00:40:32.260
<v Speaker 3>ketogenic state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning your body burns fats and uses</v>

895
00:40:32.261 --> 00:40:36.790
<v Speaker 3>that for fuel rather than carbohydrates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't really want high protein.</v>

896
00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:38.040
<v Speaker 3>You want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

897
00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:39.100
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>minimal protein.</v>

898
00:40:39.101 --> 00:40:41.320
<v Speaker 3>You want what you're supposed to have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is like,</v>

899
00:40:41.590 --> 00:40:43.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>six ounce steak is fine,</v>

900
00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:46.210
<v Speaker 3>but what you really want is a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 3>healthy fats like coconut oil,</v>

901
00:40:46.211 --> 00:40:48.190
<v Speaker 3>Avocados.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I eat a lot of Avocados.</v>

902
00:40:49.210 --> 00:40:51.130
<v Speaker 3>Salmon is excellent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>excellent.</v>

903
00:40:51.131 --> 00:40:54.550
<v Speaker 3>But also because excellent because it</v>
<v Speaker 3>supplies you with Omega six isn't threes</v>

904
00:40:54.850 --> 00:40:57.190
<v Speaker 3>the essential fatty acids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which are really important for brain</v>

905
00:40:57.191 --> 00:40:59.350
<v Speaker 3>function.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But people this,</v>

906
00:40:59.351 --> 00:41:02.020
<v Speaker 3>this idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is also a big fucking problem that</v>

907
00:41:02.021 --> 00:41:05.140
<v Speaker 3>people have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've been lied to about fats,</v>

908
00:41:05.230 --> 00:41:08.980
<v Speaker 3>about the danger of saturated fats and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the danger of cholesterol.</v>

909
00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:13.390
<v Speaker 3>Dietary cholesterol barely moves the</v>
<v Speaker 3>needle on blood lipids.</v>

910
00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:15.580
<v Speaker 3>It's not dietary cholesterol.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a problem.</v>

911
00:41:15.581 --> 00:41:17.710
<v Speaker 3>It's sedentary lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's overeating.</v>

912
00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:22.900
<v Speaker 3>It's a consumption of excess carbs is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch of factors that cause people to be</v>

913
00:41:22.901 --> 00:41:27.901
<v Speaker 3>fat and it's not necessarily saturated</v>
<v Speaker 3>fats or or um,</v>

914
00:41:28.450 --> 00:41:29.980
<v Speaker 3>or cholesterol.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

915
00:41:29.981 --> 00:41:33.130
<v Speaker 3>saturated fats and cholesterol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the substrate for building</v>

916
00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:35.310
<v Speaker 3>testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when,</v>

917
00:41:35.311 --> 00:41:37.980
<v Speaker 3>when I went on this diet of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

918
00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:41.660
<v Speaker 3>having my body burn fat and not just me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a ton of my friends,</v>

919
00:41:41.661 --> 00:41:43.300
<v Speaker 3>my friend Denny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

920
00:41:43.330 --> 00:41:44.570
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was a,</v>

921
00:41:44.571 --> 00:41:47.540
<v Speaker 3>a an elite athlete is a Brazilian</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu world champion.</v>

922
00:41:47.570 --> 00:41:50.090
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my friend John Rollo who's a MMA</v>

923
00:41:50.091 --> 00:41:51.380
<v Speaker 3>fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brazilian Jujitsu,</v>

924
00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:54.230
<v Speaker 3>black belt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these guys have all reported jai and me</v>

925
00:41:54.231 --> 00:41:57.320
<v Speaker 3>included gigantic spikes in their</v>
<v Speaker 3>testosterone production.</v>

926
00:41:57.770 --> 00:42:00.740
<v Speaker 3>And it's because that is the building</v>
<v Speaker 3>blocks for testosterone.</v>

927
00:42:00.741 --> 00:42:04.100
<v Speaker 3>So when you're eating these low fat</v>
<v Speaker 3>diets and these,</v>

928
00:42:04.101 --> 00:42:07.040
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these like minimalistic diets to try to</v>

929
00:42:07.041 --> 00:42:10.820
<v Speaker 3>get your body to be more healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're dropping your body sex hormone</v>

930
00:42:10.821 --> 00:42:12.440
<v Speaker 3>production.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

931
00:42:12.441 --> 00:42:15.170
<v Speaker 3>we'll have to ask my wife if she has any</v>
<v Speaker 3>complaints of that department.</v>

932
00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:16.033
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

933
00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:18.230
<v Speaker 3>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck.</v>

934
00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:19.690
<v Speaker 3>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

935
00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:24.820
<v Speaker 3>the only problem I have is when I walk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I walk away from those types of</v>

936
00:42:25.911 --> 00:42:27.620
<v Speaker 3>dyes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is where the problem arises.</v>

937
00:42:27.621 --> 00:42:28.520
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

938
00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:32.570
<v Speaker 3>But I bet that if you walked away from</v>
<v Speaker 3>what had,</v>

939
00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:35.870
<v Speaker 3>whenever you're on that diet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you get off it,</v>

940
00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:39.620
<v Speaker 3>the things this integrate very quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you don't descend it,</v>

941
00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:40.483
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

942
00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:42.140
<v Speaker 3>but I guess for me they do.</v>

943
00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:42.891
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could,</v>

944
00:42:42.891 --> 00:42:46.340
<v Speaker 3>I could put on seven pounds in two weeks</v>
<v Speaker 3>by simply eating.</v>

945
00:42:46.341 --> 00:42:49.400
<v Speaker 3>Normally once I'm away from that side is</v>
<v Speaker 3>normal.</v>

946
00:42:49.401 --> 00:42:53.510
<v Speaker 3>Then if you're putting that much weight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seven pounds in two weeks is 14 pounds</v>

947
00:42:53.511 --> 00:42:54.344
<v Speaker 3>in a month.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

948
00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:57.020
<v Speaker 3>that means 28 pounds in two months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some liberty,</v>

949
00:42:57.021 --> 00:42:58.450
<v Speaker 3>that's not normal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

950
00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:00.770
<v Speaker 3>That's a crazy amount of weight to put</v>
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

951
00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:03.410
<v Speaker 3>If I saw you two months later and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>put it on 28 pounds,</v>

952
00:43:03.411 --> 00:43:05.120
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck are you doing?</v>

953
00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:06.740
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd have to grab you by the hand and sit</v>

954
00:43:06.741 --> 00:43:07.730
<v Speaker 3>down with you and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on,</v>

955
00:43:07.731 --> 00:43:08.750
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want you to die.</v>

956
00:43:08.810 --> 00:43:10.460
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm already thinking about all the</v>

957
00:43:10.461 --> 00:43:12.110
<v Speaker 3>comments that are going to be at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>blind.</v>

958
00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:13.300
<v Speaker 3>Oh boy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I'm,</v>

959
00:43:13.310 --> 00:43:15.050
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm just saying this cause I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>your friend.</v>

960
00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:16.760
<v Speaker 3>I want to get your copy of this book.</v>

961
00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:19.490
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That I would love you to try to do it,</v>

962
00:43:19.491 --> 00:43:24.350
<v Speaker 3>but it's not hard to just eat til you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>satisfied and not eat until you're full.</v>

963
00:43:24.490 --> 00:43:27.980
<v Speaker 3>That's a big factor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That alone is probably 20% of everyone's</v>

964
00:43:27.981 --> 00:43:30.650
<v Speaker 3>meal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people eat and then they keep</v>

965
00:43:30.651 --> 00:43:32.120
<v Speaker 3>going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love to do that.</v>

966
00:43:32.210 --> 00:43:35.360
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love to eat a giant bowl of pasta and</v>

967
00:43:35.361 --> 00:43:38.450
<v Speaker 3>eat a big steak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I also work out like a terrorist.</v>

968
00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:40.640
<v Speaker 3>I do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I work out almost every day.</v>

969
00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:44.570
<v Speaker 3>I kind of work out hard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I keep my body fat down because of</v>

970
00:43:44.571 --> 00:43:46.250
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So even if my diet has shit,</v>

971
00:43:46.610 --> 00:43:50.600
<v Speaker 3>I still keep my body fat down because of</v>
<v Speaker 3>tremendous working out.</v>

972
00:43:50.690 --> 00:43:55.130
<v Speaker 3>But then when I adjust my diet as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw a big difference in my energy</v>

973
00:43:55.131 --> 00:44:00.020
<v Speaker 3>levels and my cognitive function and a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a big difference in just overall</v>

974
00:44:00.021 --> 00:44:00.854
<v Speaker 3>wellness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

975
00:44:00.910 --> 00:44:01.743
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't,</v>

976
00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:06.440
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm an extremist when it comes to</v>
<v Speaker 3>physical performance because obviously</v>

977
00:44:06.441 --> 00:44:09.900
<v Speaker 3>I've been around it my whole life and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in the martial arts world and I'm,</v>

978
00:44:09.901 --> 00:44:13.670
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to get my body to do certain</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that are very unusual.</v>

979
00:44:13.970 --> 00:44:18.970
<v Speaker 3>But I just think that people are not</v>
<v Speaker 3>designed to eat big plates of Pasta or</v>

980
00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:25.900
<v Speaker 3>bread or all these sugars that everybody</v>
<v Speaker 3>downs in the form of corn syrup drinks.</v>

981
00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:29.480
<v Speaker 3>It's just not good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen the uh,</v>

982
00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:32.120
<v Speaker 3>documentary sugar</v>

983
00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:33.390
<v Speaker 4>or something?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't remember what the sugar,</v>

984
00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:34.650
<v Speaker 4>that sugar movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

985
00:44:34.651 --> 00:44:36.930
<v Speaker 4>it was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Festival is a watch with my kids and</v>

986
00:44:36.931 --> 00:44:39.050
<v Speaker 4>then we went to the supermarket was</v>
<v Speaker 4>hilarious cause they're,</v>

987
00:44:39.051 --> 00:44:42.690
<v Speaker 4>they're grabbing things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>going sugar in this,</v>

988
00:44:42.691 --> 00:44:44.550
<v Speaker 4>they were like grabbing things off the</v>
<v Speaker 4>shelf,</v>

989
00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:47.580
<v Speaker 4>finding how many grams of sugar per</v>
<v Speaker 4>serving or,</v>

990
00:44:47.581 --> 00:44:48.570
<v Speaker 4>and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So let us,</v>

991
00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:49.580
<v Speaker 4>maybe I'll say this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

992
00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:52.410
<v Speaker 4>if you say something publicly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you have to kind of add to it.</v>

993
00:44:52.411 --> 00:44:53.280
<v Speaker 4>Say it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So let,</v>

994
00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:55.740
<v Speaker 4>here's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's what should I look at the camera</v>

995
00:44:55.741 --> 00:44:56.574
<v Speaker 4>here?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

996
00:44:56.610 --> 00:45:01.140
<v Speaker 4>next time I'm on your show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I should hopefully be visibly thinner.</v>

997
00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:02.330
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which you're going to do is you're going</v>

998
00:45:02.331 --> 00:45:04.740
<v Speaker 4>to wait until two weeks before the show</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you're going to stop your</v>

999
00:45:04.741 --> 00:45:07.760
<v Speaker 4>period and you're going to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to go anorexia,</v>

1000
00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:11.400
<v Speaker 4>Anorexia and stop your reproductive</v>
<v Speaker 4>system.</v>

1001
00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:12.060
<v Speaker 4>Very nice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1002
00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:16.650
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's just people should be more</v>
<v Speaker 4>healthy and the body is designed,</v>

1003
00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:19.680
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is this whole trend for like</v>
<v Speaker 4>Paleo Diet,</v>

1004
00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:23.610
<v Speaker 4>Paleo diets and Paleolithic Diet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not an accurate term.</v>

1005
00:45:23.970 --> 00:45:24.650
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's an,</v>

1006
00:45:24.650 --> 00:45:26.280
<v Speaker 4>it's an,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a good way to eat,</v>

1007
00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:30.120
<v Speaker 4>but it's not an accurate evolutionary</v>
<v Speaker 4>term because in the Para Paleolithic</v>

1008
00:45:30.121 --> 00:45:31.410
<v Speaker 4>era,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people ate a lot of grains.</v>

1009
00:45:31.411 --> 00:45:33.210
<v Speaker 4>They whatever the fuck they could,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they bugs.</v>

1010
00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:34.540
<v Speaker 4>They were hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1011
00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:37.890
<v Speaker 4>and they worked hard to acquire it off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

1012
00:45:37.950 --> 00:45:39.270
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a big point.</v>

1013
00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:41.550
<v Speaker 4>When they needed those calories in</v>
<v Speaker 4>grains,</v>

1014
00:45:41.551 --> 00:45:41.851
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1015
00:45:41.851 --> 00:45:44.100
<v Speaker 4>if you're out hiking every day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you talk to people that are like</v>

1016
00:45:44.101 --> 00:45:47.400
<v Speaker 4>mountain climbers and hikers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they're eating massive amounts of</v>

1017
00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:50.700
<v Speaker 4>calories.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have friends that go on these gigantic</v>

1018
00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:55.880
<v Speaker 4>mountain trips and they literally cannot</v>
<v Speaker 4>consume enough because they pack all</v>

1019
00:45:55.891 --> 00:45:57.330
<v Speaker 4>their food.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1020
00:45:57.470 --> 00:46:02.130
<v Speaker 4>and my friend Jason just got back from</v>
<v Speaker 4>this a big trip that he was taking to</v>

1021
00:46:02.250 --> 00:46:05.220
<v Speaker 4>the Yukon and he's going up and doing</v>
<v Speaker 4>all this mountain climbing.</v>

1022
00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:08.190
<v Speaker 4>They climbed a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they went a hundred miles in eight days</v>

1023
00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:11.820
<v Speaker 4>up in the mountains,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like at 10,000 feet altitude.</v>

1024
00:46:11.821 --> 00:46:14.820
<v Speaker 4>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's this incredibly grueling experience</v>

1025
00:46:14.821 --> 00:46:18.720
<v Speaker 4>because there's very little air and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're constantly doing squats cause</v>

1026
00:46:18.721 --> 00:46:23.460
<v Speaker 4>you're constantly lifting your body up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going up hill and they were</v>

1027
00:46:23.461 --> 00:46:25.860
<v Speaker 4>eating two pounds of food a day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's all you could take.</v>

1028
00:46:25.900 --> 00:46:29.280
<v Speaker 4>So you have to eat the most calorie</v>
<v Speaker 4>dense two pounds of food that you could</v>

1029
00:46:29.490 --> 00:46:31.710
<v Speaker 4>carry because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for this trip,</v>

1030
00:46:31.711 --> 00:46:33.060
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're only carrying a certain amount of</v>

1031
00:46:33.061 --> 00:46:35.340
<v Speaker 4>food cause you have to have your</v>
<v Speaker 4>sleeping bag on your back,</v>

1032
00:46:35.341 --> 00:46:36.960
<v Speaker 4>your tent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all that jazz.</v>

1033
00:46:36.961 --> 00:46:39.960
<v Speaker 4>And he'd come out of there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're 15 pounds lighter right here.</v>

1034
00:46:40.050 --> 00:46:42.090
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just had this incredible,</v>

1035
00:46:42.091 --> 00:46:43.290
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1036
00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:45.420
<v Speaker 4>it's like running a marathon every day</v>
<v Speaker 4>almost.</v>

1037
00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:48.600
<v Speaker 4>Are you familiar with the field of</v>
<v Speaker 4>evolutionary medicine?</v>

1038
00:46:49.590 --> 00:46:50.760
<v Speaker 4>Does that ring a bell?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What way?</v>

1039
00:46:50.850 --> 00:46:54.510
<v Speaker 4>So evolutionary medicine is basically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually I had one of the pioneers of</v>

1040
00:46:54.511 --> 00:46:56.680
<v Speaker 4>the field on my show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His name is Randy Nessa.</v>

1041
00:46:56.681 --> 00:46:59.880
<v Speaker 4>He's a physician by training.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So evolutionary medicine is basically</v>

1042
00:46:59.881 --> 00:47:03.750
<v Speaker 4>trying to infuse within medicine</v>
<v Speaker 4>evolutionary ideas.</v>

1043
00:47:04.050 --> 00:47:06.450
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>typically most physicians are trained in</v>

1044
00:47:06.451 --> 00:47:07.710
<v Speaker 4>the proximate world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1045
00:47:07.711 --> 00:47:11.460
<v Speaker 4>We were talking about proximate and</v>
<v Speaker 4>ultimate about how to deal with the how</v>

1046
00:47:11.461 --> 00:47:15.330
<v Speaker 4>and what other disease without ever</v>
<v Speaker 4>asking the ultimate wide Darwinian why.</v>

1047
00:47:15.570 --> 00:47:17.970
<v Speaker 4>So as relating to something that we</v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about now,</v>

1048
00:47:17.971 --> 00:47:20.820
<v Speaker 4>if you look at the top killers around</v>
<v Speaker 4>the world,</v>

1049
00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:23.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>colon cancer and diabetes and heart</v>

1050
00:47:23.731 --> 00:47:28.140
<v Speaker 4>disease and high blood pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're all related.</v>

1051
00:47:28.170 --> 00:47:32.140
<v Speaker 4>As evolutionary folks argue to that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's called the mismatch hypothesis.</v>

1052
00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:37.440
<v Speaker 4>The idea being that those things that</v>
<v Speaker 4>were adaptive to us in an environment of</v>

1053
00:47:39.341 --> 00:47:44.341
<v Speaker 4>scarcity become grossly maladaptive and</v>
<v Speaker 4>an environment of plenty like we have</v>

1054
00:47:44.711 --> 00:47:45.070
<v Speaker 4>today.</v>

1055
00:47:45.070 --> 00:47:47.320
<v Speaker 4>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so basically what you're having,</v>

1056
00:47:47.321 --> 00:47:49.570
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my gustatory preferences don't change.</v>

1057
00:47:49.690 --> 00:47:52.720
<v Speaker 4>So my desire to eat the fatty foods</v>
<v Speaker 4>remains.</v>

1058
00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:54.880
<v Speaker 4>But what has changed is the fact that I</v>
<v Speaker 4>used,</v>

1059
00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:59.620
<v Speaker 4>I had to do 20,000 calories of</v>
<v Speaker 4>expenditure to punt it down then and now</v>

1060
00:47:59.621 --> 00:48:01.630
<v Speaker 4>I could go to the grocery store and get</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1061
00:48:01.631 --> 00:48:04.270
<v Speaker 4>There is no caloric uncertainty in local</v>
<v Speaker 4>a scarcity.</v>

1062
00:48:04.570 --> 00:48:08.380
<v Speaker 4>And so if you look at hunter gatherer</v>
<v Speaker 4>societies that most closely mimic,</v>

1063
00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:10.120
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our evolutionary past,</v>

1064
00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:15.610
<v Speaker 4>they don't have all those diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So once they clear the early childhood</v>

1065
00:48:15.611 --> 00:48:20.611
<v Speaker 4>mortality threats than they actually</v>
<v Speaker 4>live quite long lifespans precisely</v>

1066
00:48:21.371 --> 00:48:24.010
<v Speaker 4>because they don't suffer from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they're the nine top killers.</v>

1067
00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:27.730
<v Speaker 4>So that's a way of taking some of this</v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff that you're very interested in and</v>

1068
00:48:27.731 --> 00:48:30.250
<v Speaker 4>infusing it with a bit more of an</v>
<v Speaker 4>evolutionary twist.</v>

1069
00:48:30.251 --> 00:48:34.220
<v Speaker 4>So that totally makes sense that people</v>
<v Speaker 4>would have to expand massive amount of</v>

1070
00:48:34.221 --> 00:48:35.500
<v Speaker 4>cowers to track down food.</v>

1071
00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:39.460
<v Speaker 4>Because that was at one point in time</v>
<v Speaker 4>what we did all day with our day,</v>

1072
00:48:39.461 --> 00:48:42.520
<v Speaker 4>whether it's hunting or gathering or or</v>
<v Speaker 4>farming.</v>

1073
00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:46.240
<v Speaker 4>We were constantly working to try to</v>
<v Speaker 4>acquire food.</v>

1074
00:48:46.270 --> 00:48:48.250
<v Speaker 4>That was it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now that food is so easy,</v>

1075
00:48:48.251 --> 00:48:50.080
<v Speaker 4>we still have the same genes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1076
00:48:50.140 --> 00:48:50.770
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1077
00:48:50.770 --> 00:48:52.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So look natural selection,</v>

1078
00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:55.270
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That the mechanism of how species</v>

1079
00:48:55.271 --> 00:48:57.010
<v Speaker 4>evolve,</v>
<v Speaker 4>traits that they have.</v>

1080
00:48:57.370 --> 00:48:59.920
<v Speaker 4>I mean it all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I teaching my students,</v>

1081
00:49:00.130 --> 00:49:02.020
<v Speaker 4>I start off by colloquially saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1082
00:49:02.021 --> 00:49:04.240
<v Speaker 4>most animals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>including humans throughout their</v>

1083
00:49:04.241 --> 00:49:05.890
<v Speaker 4>history had faced,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1084
00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:10.480
<v Speaker 4>either you don't want to become somebody</v>
<v Speaker 4>else's dinner and you want to get enough</v>

1085
00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:13.870
<v Speaker 4>for dinner for yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those are the sort of the two big that</v>

1086
00:49:13.871 --> 00:49:16.660
<v Speaker 4>the problems.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you just add to that sexual</v>

1087
00:49:16.661 --> 00:49:18.730
<v Speaker 4>selection,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is it's not enough to simply</v>

1088
00:49:18.731 --> 00:49:20.320
<v Speaker 4>survive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you have to mate.</v>

1089
00:49:20.620 --> 00:49:23.800
<v Speaker 4>And so then you had want to get the</v>
<v Speaker 4>right mannequin that I tear you go.</v>

1090
00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:27.940
<v Speaker 4>So that's basically natural and sexual</v>
<v Speaker 4>selection and in one sentence,</v>

1091
00:49:27.941 --> 00:49:29.860
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't become somebody dinner,</v>

1092
00:49:29.890 --> 00:49:33.280
<v Speaker 4>get enough dinner and then get a mate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's your evolutionary is how</v>

1093
00:49:33.281 --> 00:49:34.061
<v Speaker 4>much,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if at all,</v>

1094
00:49:34.061 --> 00:49:36.430
<v Speaker 4>do you pay attention to your gut health?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you,</v>

1095
00:49:36.431 --> 00:49:38.410
<v Speaker 4>do you eat probiotics?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ooh,</v>

1096
00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:40.180
<v Speaker 4>see that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that right?</v>

1097
00:49:40.270 --> 00:49:43.930
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probiotics are one of the most important</v>

1098
00:49:43.931 --> 00:49:48.931
<v Speaker 4>aspects of healthy bodies like your gut</v>
<v Speaker 4>health can infect or can affect rather</v>

1099
00:49:49.211 --> 00:49:51.700
<v Speaker 4>your mood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It can affect cognitive function,</v>

1100
00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:55.240
<v Speaker 4>can affect your personality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's all these studies being done now</v>

1101
00:49:55.241 --> 00:50:00.050
<v Speaker 4>on probiotics and of gut health and</v>
<v Speaker 4>bacteria content and Gut Candida.</v>

1102
00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:03.280
<v Speaker 4>If you have a high level of candy to</v>
<v Speaker 4>which a lot of people do eat a lot of</v>

1103
00:50:03.281 --> 00:50:05.810
<v Speaker 4>sugar and simple carbs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it be,</v>

1104
00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:09.130
<v Speaker 4>it developed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You developed this intense craving and</v>

1105
00:50:09.131 --> 00:50:14.131
<v Speaker 4>hunger for sugar and simple carbs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you adjust your gut bacteria,</v>

1106
00:50:14.801 --> 00:50:18.180
<v Speaker 4>when you start taking in healthy</v>
<v Speaker 4>probiotics in the form of Keifer.</v>

1107
00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:20.020
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like Kombucha.</v>

1108
00:50:20.230 --> 00:50:23.710
<v Speaker 4>I like Kimchi.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like fermented cabbage and sauerkrauts</v>

1109
00:50:23.711 --> 00:50:25.690
<v Speaker 4>and natural sauerkrauts and things along</v>
<v Speaker 4>those lines.</v>

1110
00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:26.421
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1111
00:50:26.421 --> 00:50:27.980
<v Speaker 4>I drank a of different kinds</v>

1112
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:31.010
<v Speaker 3>of them and take a bunch of different</v>
<v Speaker 3>kinds of them every day along with this</v>

1113
00:50:31.011 --> 00:50:33.080
<v Speaker 3>thing called the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on it total gut health,</v>

1114
00:50:33.350 --> 00:50:35.450
<v Speaker 3>which is a packet that I take with every</v>
<v Speaker 3>meal.</v>

1115
00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:38.960
<v Speaker 3>It's a massive factor because what's in</v>
<v Speaker 3>your gut,</v>

1116
00:50:38.990 --> 00:50:43.460
<v Speaker 3>like your gut flora is incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 3>important for your overall health and</v>

1117
00:50:43.461 --> 00:50:47.750
<v Speaker 3>for supporting your immune system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So has that become sort of part of the</v>

1118
00:50:47.751 --> 00:50:48.860
<v Speaker 3>daily,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not daily,</v>

1119
00:50:48.861 --> 00:50:51.920
<v Speaker 3>the yearly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a health checkup that people do?</v>

1120
00:50:52.130 --> 00:50:53.980
<v Speaker 3>It depends on what doctor you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>

1121
00:50:53.981 --> 00:50:56.420
<v Speaker 3>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because most doctors spend very little</v>

1122
00:50:56.421 --> 00:50:58.010
<v Speaker 3>time studying nutrition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1123
00:50:58.130 --> 00:51:00.650
<v Speaker 3>When you go to medical school and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>get a degree,</v>

1124
00:51:00.990 --> 00:51:03.440
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the amount of hours that you</v>

1125
00:51:03.441 --> 00:51:07.070
<v Speaker 3>spend studying nutrition are so small</v>
<v Speaker 3>end by the time you're out there</v>

1126
00:51:07.071 --> 00:51:09.650
<v Speaker 3>practicing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a field that's constantly</v>

1127
00:51:09.651 --> 00:51:11.930
<v Speaker 3>evolving and changing and growing and</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1128
00:51:12.170 --> 00:51:16.990
<v Speaker 3>this 10 toward this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm leaning towards probiotics as a a</v>

1129
00:51:16.991 --> 00:51:17.840
<v Speaker 3>health supplement.</v>

1130
00:51:18.110 --> 00:51:21.470
<v Speaker 3>It's fairly recent in terms of like</v>
<v Speaker 3>mainstream exposure,</v>

1131
00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:23.860
<v Speaker 3>but incredibly important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes a big fee.</v>

1132
00:51:23.930 --> 00:51:26.600
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hardly ever get sick and it's a big</v>

1133
00:51:26.601 --> 00:51:29.030
<v Speaker 3>factor cause I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I travel constantly.</v>

1134
00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:30.800
<v Speaker 3>You're shaking hands,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shaking,</v>

1135
00:51:30.801 --> 00:51:31.690
<v Speaker 3>hands,</v>
<v Speaker 3>icons.</v>

1136
00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:35.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm constantly flying on planes and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>hardly ever get sick and if I do I can</v>

1137
00:51:35.541 --> 00:51:38.270
<v Speaker 3>point to some pretty obvious factors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I didn't get any sleep.</v>

1138
00:51:38.271 --> 00:51:40.430
<v Speaker 3>My kids are going to school again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were around other people that are</v>

1139
00:51:40.431 --> 00:51:41.930
<v Speaker 3>sick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're sitting in my lap,</v>

1140
00:51:41.931 --> 00:51:45.140
<v Speaker 3>Kop it in my face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's normal stuff.</v>

1141
00:51:45.170 --> 00:51:48.470
<v Speaker 3>And even then I bounced back very</v>
<v Speaker 3>quickly and I attribute that to</v>

1142
00:51:48.530 --> 00:51:51.080
<v Speaker 3>probiotics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's really important to take in</v>

1143
00:51:51.081 --> 00:51:52.490
<v Speaker 3>healthy cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you,</v>

1144
00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:54.560
<v Speaker 3>are you feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's another example from evolutionary</v>

1145
00:51:54.561 --> 00:51:56.930
<v Speaker 3>medicine that relates to children's</v>
<v Speaker 3>since you mentioned children.</v>

1146
00:51:57.450 --> 00:51:59.030
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you probably have heard of the studies</v>

1147
00:51:59.031 --> 00:52:03.350
<v Speaker 3>that show that if you grow up in an</v>
<v Speaker 3>environment that doesn't have any</v>

1148
00:52:03.590 --> 00:52:04.800
<v Speaker 3>natural,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1149
00:52:05.330 --> 00:52:09.140
<v Speaker 3>allergens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you at an increased risk of developing</v>

1150
00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:11.390
<v Speaker 3>respiratory illnesses like asthma.</v>

1151
00:52:11.540 --> 00:52:16.540
<v Speaker 3>That makes sense sic because it doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>trigger your immune system to have the</v>

1152
00:52:16.551 --> 00:52:19.310
<v Speaker 3>types of responses that you typically</v>
<v Speaker 3>would have encountered.</v>

1153
00:52:19.311 --> 00:52:23.990
<v Speaker 3>So if you have a mother or a father or</v>
<v Speaker 3>both parents who are incredibly lcd</v>

1154
00:52:23.991 --> 00:52:27.500
<v Speaker 3>about having a perfectly sterile and</v>
<v Speaker 3>spotless home,</v>

1155
00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:31.910
<v Speaker 3>prepare for the onset of asthma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's another example of it's asthma,</v>

1156
00:52:31.911 --> 00:52:33.730
<v Speaker 3>but not necessarily allergies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>

1157
00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:35.990
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of my daughters is allergic to cats.</v>

1158
00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:39.590
<v Speaker 3>We've had cats her whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've also had dogs her whole life.</v>

1159
00:52:39.860 --> 00:52:41.570
<v Speaker 3>She's been around in these animals her</v>
<v Speaker 3>whole life,</v>

1160
00:52:41.571 --> 00:52:42.870
<v Speaker 3>but she's allergic to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

1161
00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:46.070
<v Speaker 3>what are the manifestations of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she starts sneezing or eyes get puffy.</v>

1162
00:52:46.071 --> 00:52:48.290
<v Speaker 3>The cat can't sleep in the bed with her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If the cat does,</v>

1163
00:52:48.291 --> 00:52:50.660
<v Speaker 3>she'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she starts sneezing and she can't help.</v>

1164
00:52:50.661 --> 00:52:52.360
<v Speaker 3>But it's soon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's because my wife's allergic.</v>

1165
00:52:52.370 --> 00:52:53.720
<v Speaker 3>It's just genetics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1166
00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:56.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's also solar g to horses that we</v>

1167
00:52:56.871 --> 00:53:00.710
<v Speaker 3>were in Italy and we were riding on one</v>
<v Speaker 3>of those horse carriages and she wasn't</v>

1168
00:53:00.711 --> 00:53:04.160
<v Speaker 3>even on the horse or touching the horse</v>
<v Speaker 3>just but being behind the horse on a</v>

1169
00:53:04.161 --> 00:53:06.740
<v Speaker 3>horse carriage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she starts sneezing and coughing and we</v>

1170
00:53:06.741 --> 00:53:07.810
<v Speaker 3>had to get off the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1171
00:53:07.860 --> 00:53:08.660
<v Speaker 3>off the carriage.</v>

1172
00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:09.940
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it fits the saliva,</v>

1173
00:53:09.950 --> 00:53:11.930
<v Speaker 3>the horse or the standard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The dander.</v>

1174
00:53:11.931 --> 00:53:13.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure she's allergic to saliva too,</v>

1175
00:53:13.551 --> 00:53:15.530
<v Speaker 3>but I'm just not swapping spit with a</v>
<v Speaker 3>horse and grow.</v>

1176
00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:17.210
<v Speaker 3>Settle down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gotcha.</v>

1177
00:53:17.690 --> 00:53:19.430
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's next on the docket?</v>

1178
00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:22.160
<v Speaker 3>Now that you've convinced me that I eat</v>
<v Speaker 3>to lose weight as well.</v>

1179
00:53:22.161 --> 00:53:23.930
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that you need to lose</v>
<v Speaker 3>weight,</v>

1180
00:53:23.931 --> 00:53:26.400
<v Speaker 3>but I'm saying you're a healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a smart guy.</v>

1181
00:53:26.401 --> 00:53:29.190
<v Speaker 3>You think about it very good life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're very handsome,</v>

1182
00:53:29.191 --> 00:53:30.850
<v Speaker 3>you bronze,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're shiny.</v>

1183
00:53:31.290 --> 00:53:35.070
<v Speaker 3>You're thinking in these terms of like</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at the big picture,</v>

1184
00:53:35.071 --> 00:53:39.360
<v Speaker 3>but yet there you've got this blind spot</v>
<v Speaker 3>and his blind spot is because you have</v>

1185
00:53:39.361 --> 00:53:42.090
<v Speaker 3>this indulgence for food and you look</v>
<v Speaker 3>forward to it.</v>

1186
00:53:42.091 --> 00:53:45.420
<v Speaker 3>It becomes your reward at the end of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>day and you sit down,</v>

1187
00:53:45.421 --> 00:53:46.860
<v Speaker 3>did you indulge?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you,</v>

1188
00:53:47.150 --> 00:53:47.641
<v Speaker 3>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1189
00:53:47.641 --> 00:53:50.460
<v Speaker 3>I've worked hard for this and I can</v>
<v Speaker 3>enjoy it and now I'm married,</v>

1190
00:53:50.461 --> 00:53:52.020
<v Speaker 3>I've got kids I don't need to look</v>
<v Speaker 3>beautiful.</v>

1191
00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:56.220
<v Speaker 3>And you want to hear something that says</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're getting personal in California,</v>

1192
00:53:56.221 --> 00:53:59.940
<v Speaker 3>when we lived in California,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually naturally lost a lot of</v>

1193
00:53:59.941 --> 00:54:01.650
<v Speaker 3>weight without having to worry about</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>

1194
00:54:01.770 --> 00:54:04.290
<v Speaker 3>I was a lot more active.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I ate less.</v>

1195
00:54:04.830 --> 00:54:07.620
<v Speaker 3>And what about you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've talked about a reward when you're</v>

1196
00:54:07.621 --> 00:54:12.621
<v Speaker 3>in the dark cold winters of Montreal and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only reward delivery system is for</v>

1197
00:54:14.311 --> 00:54:17.370
<v Speaker 3>us to be foodies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then that's the problem.</v>

1198
00:54:17.371 --> 00:54:18.930
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we often talk about that.</v>

1199
00:54:18.931 --> 00:54:21.330
<v Speaker 3>My wife and I because we eat at Joe beef</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Montreal,</v>

1200
00:54:21.450 --> 00:54:22.470
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he's your friend,</v>

1201
00:54:22.471 --> 00:54:22.891
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1202
00:54:22.891 --> 00:54:24.510
<v Speaker 3>If you eat in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have not.</v>

1203
00:54:24.570 --> 00:54:27.600
<v Speaker 3>Good Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are in the same town as the greatest</v>

1204
00:54:27.601 --> 00:54:30.180
<v Speaker 3>restaurant on the planet earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're supposed to go there together.</v>

1205
00:54:30.181 --> 00:54:33.180
<v Speaker 3>I think when can go back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something happened.</v>

1206
00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:34.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we will.</v>

1207
00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:36.030
<v Speaker 3>Next time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Next time I'm there.</v>

1208
00:54:36.330 --> 00:54:37.140
<v Speaker 3>I'll take you.</v>

1209
00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:39.450
<v Speaker 3>Hopefully I'll be in California.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Going to have to,</v>

1210
00:54:39.451 --> 00:54:40.201
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hopefully.</v>

1211
00:54:40.201 --> 00:54:42.870
<v Speaker 3>But if you are there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have to indulge.</v>

1212
00:54:42.930 --> 00:54:44.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one of those places we've got to</v>

1213
00:54:44.701 --> 00:54:45.710
<v Speaker 3>get off the ducks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1214
00:54:45.870 --> 00:54:47.610
<v Speaker 3>Well it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's okay to have a cheat day.</v>

1215
00:54:47.700 --> 00:54:48.533
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>

1216
00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:50.370
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1217
00:54:50.430 --> 00:54:53.820
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of people have those blind</v>
<v Speaker 3>spots and even intelligent.</v>

1218
00:54:53.821 --> 00:54:54.654
<v Speaker 3>Pete,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's yours?</v>

1219
00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:57.260
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>booze.</v>

1220
00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:01.320
<v Speaker 3>Yesterday we got fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Me and Hannibal burress to the podcast.</v>

1221
00:55:01.321 --> 00:55:03.750
<v Speaker 3>We've got a little too hammered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one of those things where I enjoy</v>

1222
00:55:03.751 --> 00:55:06.390
<v Speaker 3>it while it's happening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like I worked out today and my head</v>

1223
00:55:06.391 --> 00:55:07.620
<v Speaker 3>was kind of throbbing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1224
00:55:07.621 --> 00:55:10.650
<v Speaker 3>this is so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I don't do it every day,</v>

1225
00:55:11.010 --> 00:55:15.180
<v Speaker 3>but I do it maybe once a week or once</v>
<v Speaker 3>every two weeks or something like that.</v>

1226
00:55:15.210 --> 00:55:18.660
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know objectively that it's not healthy</v>

1227
00:55:18.790 --> 00:55:22.770
<v Speaker 3>so that you enjoy the taste or the</v>
<v Speaker 3>effects after your drinks.</v>

1228
00:55:22.770 --> 00:55:25.890
<v Speaker 3>Enjoy having drinks with friends and</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting stupid laughing,</v>

1229
00:55:26.190 --> 00:55:27.023
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1230
00:55:27.210 --> 00:55:29.070
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just know it's not healthy.</v>

1231
00:55:29.340 --> 00:55:31.290
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing healthy about booze.</v>

1232
00:55:31.291 --> 00:55:32.670
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing wrong.</v>

1233
00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:35.310
<v Speaker 3>And actually there is some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some studies that suggest that,</v>

1234
00:55:35.311 --> 00:55:38.040
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a actually pretty healthy to have a</v>

1235
00:55:38.041 --> 00:55:41.190
<v Speaker 3>glass of wine or two with a meal and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

1236
00:55:41.191 --> 00:55:45.920
<v Speaker 3>you're getting Rivera trawl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also there's some studies that uh,</v>

1237
00:55:45.970 --> 00:55:46.803
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or some,</v>

1238
00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:51.840
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some indications at 0.2 people developed</v>

1239
00:55:51.930 --> 00:55:56.580
<v Speaker 3>for a long time drinking wine because</v>
<v Speaker 3>they couldn't drink still water because</v>

1240
00:55:56.581 --> 00:56:00.330
<v Speaker 3>they would get traveler's disease where</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they found water would have pathogens</v>

1241
00:56:00.331 --> 00:56:02.130
<v Speaker 3>in it and they would wind up getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>sick.</v>

1242
00:56:02.131 --> 00:56:05.280
<v Speaker 3>So they drank wine for that purpose</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he can carry it around with you</v>

1243
00:56:05.281 --> 00:56:07.350
<v Speaker 3>and it's not going to go bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

1244
00:56:07.830 --> 00:56:10.220
<v Speaker 3>but getting drunk like we were drinking</v>
<v Speaker 3>whiskey,</v>

1245
00:56:10.540 --> 00:56:12.810
<v Speaker 3>drink jamison or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm out on the rocks.</v>

1246
00:56:12.811 --> 00:56:14.850
<v Speaker 3>It felt great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were hammered and laughing.</v>

1247
00:56:15.300 --> 00:56:17.460
<v Speaker 3>But God damn it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so bad for your body.</v>

1248
00:56:17.490 --> 00:56:19.890
<v Speaker 3>So if there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there's an indulgence that I take</v>

1249
00:56:19.891 --> 00:56:23.320
<v Speaker 3>part in that's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the occasional getting fucked up.</v>

1250
00:56:23.470 --> 00:56:23.980
<v Speaker 3>Gotcha.</v>

1251
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:25.120
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not good,</v>

1252
00:56:25.420 --> 00:56:26.910
<v Speaker 4>but I don't have a lot of those.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1253
00:56:26.930 --> 00:56:28.900
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty good at not having a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 4>those,</v>

1254
00:56:28.930 --> 00:56:31.510
<v Speaker 4>those things in my life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's easy to do that.</v>

1255
00:56:31.511 --> 00:56:35.740
<v Speaker 4>It's easy to trip yourself up because</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a natural tendency towards</v>

1256
00:56:35.741 --> 00:56:37.240
<v Speaker 4>distraction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1257
00:56:37.241 --> 00:56:40.690
<v Speaker 4>the pressure of a attempting to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>successful at something.</v>

1258
00:56:40.691 --> 00:56:44.590
<v Speaker 4>The pressure of whether it's competition</v>
<v Speaker 4>or whether it's uh,</v>

1259
00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:48.490
<v Speaker 4>just this yearning for achievement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We look for a release,</v>

1260
00:56:48.510 --> 00:56:49.630
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from that pressure.</v>

1261
00:56:49.660 --> 00:56:51.700
<v Speaker 4>And that's what a lot of people do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They go to cigarettes,</v>

1262
00:56:51.701 --> 00:56:54.220
<v Speaker 4>so they go to booze or they go to food</v>
<v Speaker 4>or whatever it is.</v>

1263
00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:56.430
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never smoked a single cigarette in</v>

1264
00:56:56.440 --> 00:56:58.640
<v Speaker 4>my entire life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good one puff good.</v>

1265
00:56:58.690 --> 00:57:01.750
<v Speaker 4>I did when I was like 15.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I smoked a cigarette with my sister.</v>

1266
00:57:02.140 --> 00:57:03.730
<v Speaker 4>She kept going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I quit.</v>

1267
00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:04.451
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>

1268
00:57:04.451 --> 00:57:05.410
<v Speaker 4>this is so stupid.</v>

1269
00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:08.740
<v Speaker 4>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that if you hit 19 and you</v>

1270
00:57:08.741 --> 00:57:11.630
<v Speaker 4>haven't started,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you almost have zero chance of starting.</v>

1271
00:57:11.660 --> 00:57:12.041
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

1272
00:57:12.041 --> 00:57:16.030
<v Speaker 4>People have started in their thirties</v>
<v Speaker 4>due to start study was fucking 40 years</v>

1273
00:57:16.031 --> 00:57:17.270
<v Speaker 4>old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He started smoking cigarettes,</v>

1274
00:57:17.271 --> 00:57:18.790
<v Speaker 4>smoking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are you doing man?</v>

1275
00:57:19.420 --> 00:57:21.070
<v Speaker 4>So weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But again,</v>

1276
00:57:21.071 --> 00:57:23.440
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a sabotage thing where</v>
<v Speaker 4>people just go,</v>

1277
00:57:23.441 --> 00:57:25.270
<v Speaker 4>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't care.</v>

1278
00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:27.790
<v Speaker 4>And by doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's almost like they can,</v>

1279
00:57:27.850 --> 00:57:29.080
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by saying,</v>

1280
00:57:29.081 --> 00:57:30.520
<v Speaker 4>fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't care about my health.</v>

1281
00:57:30.730 --> 00:57:31.660
<v Speaker 4>They could say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck it.</v>

1282
00:57:31.661 --> 00:57:33.610
<v Speaker 4>I don't care about my student loans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck it.</v>

1283
00:57:33.611 --> 00:57:35.680
<v Speaker 4>I don't care about my wife leaving me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck it.</v>

1284
00:57:35.681 --> 00:57:37.780
<v Speaker 4>I don't care about my mortgage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck it.</v>

1285
00:57:37.781 --> 00:57:40.570
<v Speaker 4>I don't care about losing my job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like this,</v>

1286
00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:45.490
<v Speaker 4>this sort of like denial of reality by</v>
<v Speaker 4>indulging in something that's not</v>

1287
00:57:45.491 --> 00:57:48.820
<v Speaker 4>healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It reminded me of a irrational position</v>

1288
00:57:48.821 --> 00:57:53.200
<v Speaker 4>that one of my former students took to</v>
<v Speaker 4>justify him smoking.</v>

1289
00:57:53.580 --> 00:57:56.020
<v Speaker 4>And so if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you'd do this in the</v>

1290
00:57:56.021 --> 00:57:57.070
<v Speaker 4>United States,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but in Canada,</v>

1291
00:57:57.071 --> 00:57:58.440
<v Speaker 4>Health Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1292
00:57:58.690 --> 00:58:03.430
<v Speaker 4>has this program where they put very</v>
<v Speaker 4>vivid images on cigarette packets.</v>

1293
00:58:03.431 --> 00:58:04.370
<v Speaker 4>You have the same thing here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1294
00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:05.950
<v Speaker 4>They used to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1295
00:58:05.951 --> 00:58:08.710
<v Speaker 4>not that they don't have images,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they have the sayings.</v>

1296
00:58:08.830 --> 00:58:11.020
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But in Canada with these images,</v>

1297
00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:12.730
<v Speaker 4>I should even say they used to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they still do.</v>

1298
00:58:12.810 --> 00:58:14.860
<v Speaker 4>There's still like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you know what he would do,</v>

1299
00:58:15.090 --> 00:58:18.460
<v Speaker 4>what to show you how irrational human</v>
<v Speaker 4>beings are.</v>

1300
00:58:18.820 --> 00:58:21.530
<v Speaker 4>So he would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say ask for whatever the brand was</v>

1301
00:58:21.770 --> 00:58:25.390
<v Speaker 4>marble roll.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now he would receive one and look at it.</v>

1302
00:58:25.810 --> 00:58:30.160
<v Speaker 4>If the warning message was one that</v>
<v Speaker 4>would be relevant to him,</v>

1303
00:58:30.190 --> 00:58:33.520
<v Speaker 4>he'd ask for another one until he</v>
<v Speaker 4>received got low birth weight.</v>

1304
00:58:33.790 --> 00:58:36.480
<v Speaker 4>He got low or you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't drink while pregnant.</v>

1305
00:58:37.340 --> 00:58:39.040
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't apply to me.</v>

1306
00:58:39.260 --> 00:58:40.810
<v Speaker 4>And since I looked at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said he was serious.</v>

1307
00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:43.240
<v Speaker 4>But you obviously know Bill Hicks bit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the way.</v>

1308
00:58:43.270 --> 00:58:44.770
<v Speaker 4>What does that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what does Bill Hicks,</v>

1309
00:58:44.940 --> 00:58:49.000
<v Speaker 4>who's one of the greatest comics hour?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a bit that he had on exactly</v>

1310
00:58:49.001 --> 00:58:50.170
<v Speaker 4>that point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Said just,</v>

1311
00:58:50.171 --> 00:58:52.390
<v Speaker 4>just pick one that doesn't apply.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Low birth weight.</v>

1312
00:58:52.391 --> 00:58:53.020
<v Speaker 4>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1313
00:58:53.020 --> 00:58:55.150
<v Speaker 4>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe he got it from him.</v>

1314
00:58:55.780 --> 00:58:59.710
<v Speaker 4>But it shows you how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even though we often have our fully</v>

1315
00:58:59.711 --> 00:59:03.850
<v Speaker 4>cognizant objectively about some truth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1316
00:59:03.910 --> 00:59:07.030
<v Speaker 4>our ability to engage in self deception</v>
<v Speaker 4>is limitless.</v>

1317
00:59:07.031 --> 00:59:07.841
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1318
00:59:07.841 --> 00:59:10.180
<v Speaker 4>it is for some folks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think,</v>

1319
00:59:10.181 --> 00:59:10.841
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

1320
00:59:10.841 --> 00:59:13.770
<v Speaker 4>that goes back to mindfulness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It goes back to meditation.</v>

1321
00:59:13.790 --> 00:59:16.660
<v Speaker 4>It goes back to reflection.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most people live their lives in a</v>

1322
00:59:16.661 --> 00:59:20.140
<v Speaker 4>constant state of momentum.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The momentum of the past constantly</v>

1323
00:59:20.141 --> 00:59:23.060
<v Speaker 4>propelling themselves forward,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're always adjusting and trying</v>

1324
00:59:23.061 --> 00:59:26.030
<v Speaker 4>to make up for all the mistakes that</v>
<v Speaker 4>their past is made.</v>

1325
00:59:26.180 --> 00:59:27.650
<v Speaker 4>They don't live their life in a state</v>
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

1326
00:59:27.651 --> 00:59:29.630
<v Speaker 4>in the now they lived their life in a</v>
<v Speaker 4>state of,</v>

1327
00:59:29.631 --> 00:59:30.890
<v Speaker 4>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why did I do that?</v>

1328
00:59:30.891 --> 00:59:33.050
<v Speaker 4>Now I gotta do this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I,</v>

1329
00:59:33.051 --> 00:59:35.030
<v Speaker 4>you know what I used to come to and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>think,</v>

1330
00:59:35.690 --> 00:59:38.720
<v Speaker 4>let me let me know if you feel it too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you have young children.</v>

1331
00:59:39.390 --> 00:59:43.550
<v Speaker 4>I'm obsessed about first,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

1332
00:59:43.551 --> 00:59:46.670
<v Speaker 4>this is the first time that my daughter</v>
<v Speaker 4>did this and they'll never be another</v>

1333
00:59:46.671 --> 00:59:49.880
<v Speaker 4>first.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm always panicking about them growing</v>

1334
00:59:49.881 --> 00:59:50.690
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

1335
00:59:50.690 --> 00:59:52.970
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to sort of weird,</v>

1336
00:59:53.410 --> 00:59:55.130
<v Speaker 4>just it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a purity,</v>

1337
00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:55.971
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1338
00:59:55.971 --> 00:59:59.150
<v Speaker 4>we live in a world where we're exposed</v>
<v Speaker 4>because we're in the public eye.</v>

1339
00:59:59.151 --> 01:00:02.630
<v Speaker 4>We're exposed to a lot of negativity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even though we're exposed to a 100 fold</v>

1340
01:00:02.631 --> 01:00:04.280
<v Speaker 4>more positivity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1341
01:00:04.281 --> 01:00:05.930
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a rough ride out there.</v>

1342
01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:11.200
<v Speaker 4>And then my solace is coming home to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>purity and innocence of my children.</v>

1343
01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:16.820
<v Speaker 4>And then the reality is that you can't</v>
<v Speaker 4>bottle up that innocence and that purity</v>

1344
01:00:16.821 --> 01:00:18.200
<v Speaker 4>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I,</v>

1345
01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:21.320
<v Speaker 4>so speaking of the here and now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rather than oftentimes just enjoying the</v>

1346
01:00:21.321 --> 01:00:23.090
<v Speaker 4>moment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm always worried that,</v>

1347
01:00:23.210 --> 01:00:25.240
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in five years she,</v>

1348
01:00:25.241 --> 01:00:28.040
<v Speaker 4>she's going to be a prepubescent girl</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then there's going to be a bunch of,</v>

1349
01:00:28.370 --> 01:00:30.030
<v Speaker 4>take this young boys that are gonna come</v>
<v Speaker 4>around.</v>

1350
01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:33.080
<v Speaker 4>So that's something that truly bothers</v>
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>

1351
01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:35.970
<v Speaker 4>Does it doesn't affect you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1352
01:00:36.020 --> 01:00:38.270
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't dwell on it honestly.</v>

1353
01:00:38.271 --> 01:00:40.730
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just try to enjoy every moment I can</v>

1354
01:00:40.731 --> 01:00:43.610
<v Speaker 4>with them and try and enjoy all the</v>
<v Speaker 4>different stage of their life.</v>

1355
01:00:43.611 --> 01:00:44.410
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

1356
01:00:44.410 --> 01:00:45.243
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1357
01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:48.140
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember what they were like when they</v>

1358
01:00:48.141 --> 01:00:50.660
<v Speaker 4>were babies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they could barely talk.</v>

1359
01:00:50.990 --> 01:00:51.860
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>

1360
01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:53.960
<v Speaker 4>I was thinking I could never love</v>
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

1361
01:00:53.961 --> 01:00:55.310
<v Speaker 4>It's a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>much as I love them,</v>

1362
01:00:55.490 --> 01:00:59.240
<v Speaker 4>but now I think when I talked to them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love them even more because now I get</v>

1363
01:00:59.241 --> 01:01:01.190
<v Speaker 4>to have little conversations with</v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

1364
01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:02.960
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you have like a deep conversation</v>

1365
01:01:02.961 --> 01:01:05.690
<v Speaker 4>with an eight year old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty intense and it's one of your</v>

1366
01:01:05.691 --> 01:01:08.300
<v Speaker 4>child and your daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty intense,</v>

1367
01:01:08.330 --> 01:01:11.330
<v Speaker 4>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Humbling when they ask you things that</v>

1368
01:01:11.331 --> 01:01:13.880
<v Speaker 4>clearly demonstrates out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1369
01:01:13.881 --> 01:01:17.060
<v Speaker 4>little about so many things because they</v>
<v Speaker 4>often will ask you the questions that</v>

1370
01:01:17.061 --> 01:01:21.740
<v Speaker 4>are profound and deep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why is lightning in that particular</v>

1371
01:01:21.741 --> 01:01:24.680
<v Speaker 4>form?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you try to concoct some story while</v>

1372
01:01:24.681 --> 01:01:27.350
<v Speaker 4>being truthful and then oftentimes they</v>
<v Speaker 4>stump you.</v>

1373
01:01:27.351 --> 01:01:28.520
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1374
01:01:28.670 --> 01:01:30.110
<v Speaker 4>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just go to Google man.</v>

1375
01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:32.870
<v Speaker 4>Well it's got a heart to go to Google</v>
<v Speaker 4>while you're driving and having a</v>

1376
01:01:32.871 --> 01:01:35.420
<v Speaker 4>conversation about some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some observation of that just made,</v>

1377
01:01:35.630 --> 01:01:37.730
<v Speaker 4>but it just shows you again the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1378
01:01:37.770 --> 01:01:42.680
<v Speaker 4>the purity of the child and sort of</v>
<v Speaker 4>looking at the world and hitting you</v>

1379
01:01:42.681 --> 01:01:44.720
<v Speaker 4>with questions that you frankly can't</v>
<v Speaker 4>answer.</v>

1380
01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:46.700
<v Speaker 4>Well I always like to say that I can't</v>
<v Speaker 4>answer it.</v>

1381
01:01:46.730 --> 01:01:50.140
<v Speaker 4>I think it's important to let kids know</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you don't know everything.</v>

1382
01:01:50.141 --> 01:01:50.841
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1383
01:01:50.841 --> 01:01:55.310
<v Speaker 4>cause I think children automatically</v>
<v Speaker 4>look towards adults as being some sort</v>

1384
01:01:55.311 --> 01:01:57.650
<v Speaker 4>of superior form of a child.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1385
01:01:57.651 --> 01:01:58.251
<v Speaker 4>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1386
01:01:58.251 --> 01:01:59.720
<v Speaker 4>I don't know anything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm a little kid,</v>

1387
01:01:59.721 --> 01:02:01.800
<v Speaker 4>but my dad will know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you know,</v>

1388
01:02:01.810 --> 01:02:03.200
<v Speaker 4>if you let them know like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

1389
01:02:03.201 --> 01:02:05.660
<v Speaker 4>there's just way too much information</v>
<v Speaker 4>for everyone to know.</v>

1390
01:02:05.661 --> 01:02:08.150
<v Speaker 4>But what's important is you're honest</v>
<v Speaker 4>about what you do now.</v>

1391
01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:10.970
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we were very fortunate that we have</v>

1392
01:02:10.971 --> 01:02:15.410
<v Speaker 4>this thing called the Internet so we can</v>
<v Speaker 4>find out what it is that we're trying to</v>

1393
01:02:15.411 --> 01:02:17.180
<v Speaker 4>give them the answer for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And incidentally,</v>

1394
01:02:17.181 --> 01:02:21.690
<v Speaker 4>I do that with my one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They ask a question and let's see.</v>

1395
01:02:21.691 --> 01:02:23.640
<v Speaker 4>I don't know the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm very open.</v>

1396
01:02:23.641 --> 01:02:24.474
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>

1397
01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:25.530
<v Speaker 4>I think you've gone with this one.</v>

1398
01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:26.191
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>good for you.</v>

1399
01:02:26.191 --> 01:02:27.960
<v Speaker 4>Why don't you send me an email,</v>
<v Speaker 4>remind me.</v>

1400
01:02:27.961 --> 01:02:29.260
<v Speaker 4>And I'll look into it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1401
01:02:29.261 --> 01:02:32.460
<v Speaker 4>and I do it just naturally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but oftentimes they'll write back to me</v>

1402
01:02:32.461 --> 01:02:34.080
<v Speaker 4>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know why that was so refreshing?</v>

1403
01:02:34.330 --> 01:02:36.690
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you are humble enough to not pretend</v>

1404
01:02:36.691 --> 01:02:38.640
<v Speaker 4>that you know everything about every</v>
<v Speaker 4>single thing.</v>

1405
01:02:38.641 --> 01:02:39.474
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1406
01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:40.500
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love that.</v>

1407
01:02:40.501 --> 01:02:42.970
<v Speaker 4>And it's so frustrating when you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>talking to someone who was really smart,</v>

1408
01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.420
<v Speaker 4>who don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't want to admit that they don't</v>

1409
01:02:45.421 --> 01:02:48.750
<v Speaker 4>know something or wants to deny</v>
<v Speaker 4>something's true when they haven't</v>

1410
01:02:48.751 --> 01:02:50.520
<v Speaker 4>researched it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very frustrating.</v>

1411
01:02:50.820 --> 01:02:52.710
<v Speaker 4>I have a friend who's a brilliant guy</v>
<v Speaker 4>who does that.</v>

1412
01:02:52.711 --> 01:02:54.450
<v Speaker 4>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll bring something up and he's like,</v>

1413
01:02:54.451 --> 01:02:55.410
<v Speaker 4>that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you're like,</v>

1414
01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:57.450
<v Speaker 4>oh Jesus fucking Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We just google it.</v>

1415
01:02:57.470 --> 01:02:59.610
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I've done it with him over and over</v>

1416
01:02:59.611 --> 01:03:00.240
<v Speaker 4>and over again.</v>

1417
01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:01.800
<v Speaker 4>I had to have a conversation with them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

1418
01:03:01.801 --> 01:03:03.150
<v Speaker 4>listen man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I tell you something,</v>

1419
01:03:03.151 --> 01:03:03.820
<v Speaker 4>it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1420
01:03:03.820 --> 01:03:06.660
<v Speaker 4>I'm not making it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if I'm wrong,</v>

1421
01:03:06.890 --> 01:03:08.520
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's an honest mistake.</v>

1422
01:03:08.550 --> 01:03:10.890
<v Speaker 4>But if you just google it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you'll know.</v>

1423
01:03:10.891 --> 01:03:12.930
<v Speaker 4>But you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're saying it's not true and you've</v>

1424
01:03:12.931 --> 01:03:17.460
<v Speaker 4>never even looked at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But here we are in 2016 give a fucking,</v>

1425
01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:20.850
<v Speaker 4>you have a device in your pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can get the answer to virtually</v>

1426
01:03:20.851 --> 01:03:22.120
<v Speaker 4>anything at anytime.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1427
01:03:22.290 --> 01:03:24.840
<v Speaker 4>shit is out the window.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what's the psychological trait?</v>

1428
01:03:25.010 --> 01:03:25.710
<v Speaker 4>Ego.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ego.</v>

1429
01:03:25.710 --> 01:03:29.070
<v Speaker 4>He's a very smart guy and he wants to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>the smartest guy in the room all the</v>

1430
01:03:29.071 --> 01:03:32.070
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so it just gets really frustrating,</v>

1431
01:03:32.130 --> 01:03:34.980
<v Speaker 4>especially if we're somewhere with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no Internet service.</v>

1432
01:03:35.450 --> 01:03:36.810
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to get to Internet service</v>

1433
01:03:36.870 --> 01:03:38.520
<v Speaker 4>motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you're gonna apologize.</v>

1434
01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:39.391
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1435
01:03:39.391 --> 01:03:41.340
<v Speaker 4>it's this thing that people do where</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1436
01:03:41.350 --> 01:03:43.290
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're having a conversation with</v>

1437
01:03:43.291 --> 01:03:45.450
<v Speaker 4>someone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not just talking to you.</v>

1438
01:03:45.450 --> 01:03:47.490
<v Speaker 4>They're engaged in a contest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1439
01:03:48.030 --> 01:03:49.110
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Men Do that.</v>

1440
01:03:49.111 --> 01:03:51.480
<v Speaker 4>All that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have several of those in my own,</v>

1441
01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:52.910
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and not nuclear family,</v>

1442
01:03:52.911 --> 01:03:57.630
<v Speaker 4>but my family of procreation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so might brutal and say who but brutal.</v>

1443
01:03:57.631 --> 01:03:58.410
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1444
01:03:58.410 --> 01:04:02.310
<v Speaker 4>and here's another thing that you'd</v>
<v Speaker 4>never admit that you're wrong,</v>

1445
01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:04.890
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because admitting that you're wrong</v>

1446
01:04:05.250 --> 01:04:09.870
<v Speaker 4>makes you lose face.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's such a detrimental dynamic to</v>

1447
01:04:09.871 --> 01:04:10.704
<v Speaker 4>have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1448
01:04:10.710 --> 01:04:11.850
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1449
01:04:11.851 --> 01:04:13.340
<v Speaker 4>I might come home at night and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1450
01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:17.370
<v Speaker 4>I've had a tough day and I might respond</v>
<v Speaker 4>curtly to my dog.</v>

1451
01:04:17.910 --> 01:04:19.920
<v Speaker 4>I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll go back and then hug my dog</v>

1452
01:04:19.921 --> 01:04:23.370
<v Speaker 4>because I have enough self awareness to</v>
<v Speaker 4>realize that I didn't give her enough</v>

1453
01:04:23.371 --> 01:04:24.090
<v Speaker 4>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1454
01:04:24.090 --> 01:04:27.480
<v Speaker 4>So I have enough humility to nevermind,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1455
01:04:27.481 --> 01:04:29.910
<v Speaker 4>another human.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My dog is just as important to me and if</v>

1456
01:04:29.911 --> 01:04:33.150
<v Speaker 4>I responded curtly I will sort of</v>
<v Speaker 4>apologize to her yet I haven't got</v>

1457
01:04:33.151 --> 01:04:34.140
<v Speaker 4>family members.</v>

1458
01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:35.190
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

1459
01:04:35.191 --> 01:04:38.160
<v Speaker 4>this is not my family of my wife or</v>
<v Speaker 4>kids,</v>

1460
01:04:38.490 --> 01:04:43.320
<v Speaker 4>but the family that I was born into that</v>
<v Speaker 4>have never apologized about anything</v>

1461
01:04:43.321 --> 01:04:48.321
<v Speaker 4>because they come from a cultural</v>
<v Speaker 4>landscape where to apologize to your</v>

1462
01:04:48.391 --> 01:04:51.210
<v Speaker 4>child,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to somebody younger is to lose face at</v>

1463
01:04:51.211 --> 01:04:54.840
<v Speaker 4>parent is always right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I mean that might work when you're</v>

1464
01:04:54.841 --> 01:04:57.420
<v Speaker 4>too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when you're both now adults,</v>

1465
01:04:57.480 --> 01:04:59.910
<v Speaker 4>I think you sort of have to get out of</v>
<v Speaker 4>that and realize that we all make</v>

1466
01:04:59.911 --> 01:05:01.680
<v Speaker 4>mistakes and we all have to own up to</v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

1467
01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:04.320
<v Speaker 4>We all have to apologize,</v>
<v Speaker 4>honesty when we make a mistake.</v>

1468
01:05:04.710 --> 01:05:08.190
<v Speaker 4>And yet some people it's super unhealthy</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's unhealthy for the person who</v>

1469
01:05:08.191 --> 01:05:11.040
<v Speaker 4>doesn't admit they make the mistake too</v>
<v Speaker 4>because then it puts you in this</v>

1470
01:05:11.041 --> 01:05:13.950
<v Speaker 4>position of being in denial of what you</v>
<v Speaker 4>know to be the truth,</v>

1471
01:05:13.980 --> 01:05:15.930
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to run around pretending</v>

1472
01:05:16.140 --> 01:05:18.070
<v Speaker 4>that you were right all when you know in</v>

1473
01:05:18.070 --> 01:05:21.370
<v Speaker 1>your head that you were wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it diminishes your own personal</v>

1474
01:05:21.430 --> 01:05:23.100
<v Speaker 1>opinions about yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1475
01:05:23.490 --> 01:05:26.170
<v Speaker 1>You're not sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ready on this exact point.</v>

1476
01:05:26.171 --> 01:05:28.480
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm having a chat with a family</v>

1477
01:05:28.481 --> 01:05:31.130
<v Speaker 1>member,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an older family member of mine for my</v>

1478
01:05:31.150 --> 01:05:33.730
<v Speaker 1>family as the problem person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

1479
01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:37.030
<v Speaker 1>this is one of the key problem for</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in with my family.</v>

1480
01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:39.160
<v Speaker 1>And we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1481
01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:40.960
<v Speaker 1>he says something to the effect of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1482
01:05:40.961 --> 01:05:42.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those ancient Greeks,</v>

1483
01:05:42.620 --> 01:05:44.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those Christians were really,</v>

1484
01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:46.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>antisemetic where I come up with these</v>

1485
01:05:47.050 --> 01:05:47.950
<v Speaker 1>details.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1486
01:05:47.980 --> 01:05:48.311
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1487
01:05:48.311 --> 01:05:48.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1488
01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:50.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean to correct you,</v>

1489
01:05:50.261 --> 01:05:51.094
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1490
01:05:51.250 --> 01:05:54.250
<v Speaker 1>those ancient Greeks were not Christian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a matter of fact,</v>

1491
01:05:54.460 --> 01:05:58.330
<v Speaker 1>the way we mark that eras,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we say bce before common era or BC</v>

1492
01:05:58.331 --> 01:06:00.490
<v Speaker 1>before Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So by definition,</v>

1493
01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:04.180
<v Speaker 1>those guys were marked as not being</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christian.</v>

1494
01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:08.860
<v Speaker 1>So when he's now faced with sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>historical evidence that suggested he</v>

1495
01:06:08.861 --> 01:06:10.720
<v Speaker 1>was wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think he does?</v>

1496
01:06:10.860 --> 01:06:13.300
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so grotesque that I'm not even sure</v>

1497
01:06:13.301 --> 01:06:15.880
<v Speaker 1>you can guess what he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to guess.</v>

1498
01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:17.650
<v Speaker 1>So he basically says no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

1499
01:06:17.651 --> 01:06:20.050
<v Speaker 1>That's what I said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said that they weren't Christian and</v>

1500
01:06:20.051 --> 01:06:23.260
<v Speaker 1>you said that they were Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he looks at you in the face.</v>

1501
01:06:23.261 --> 01:06:24.041
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's called,</v>

1502
01:06:24.041 --> 01:06:25.990
<v Speaker 1>if I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't mind me saying on air,</v>

1503
01:06:26.020 --> 01:06:28.810
<v Speaker 1>that's mind fucking right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looks at you in the face.</v>

1504
01:06:29.140 --> 01:06:30.580
<v Speaker 1>He knows that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1505
01:06:31.060 --> 01:06:33.120
<v Speaker 1>but he has enough in Arabic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say what?</v>

1506
01:06:33.121 --> 01:06:36.490
<v Speaker 1>Ha it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's this kind of pathological pride.</v>

1507
01:06:36.610 --> 01:06:37.900
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>

1508
01:06:38.170 --> 01:06:39.460
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to look at you.</v>

1509
01:06:39.670 --> 01:06:41.080
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So rather than saying,</v>

1510
01:06:41.140 --> 01:06:42.400
<v Speaker 1>Oh gee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that.</v>

1511
01:06:42.401 --> 01:06:46.420
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for correcting me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He flips what our original points of</v>

1512
01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:49.380
<v Speaker 1>disagreement was</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1513
01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:51.850
<v Speaker 1>You can talk to that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to cut that guy loose.</v>

1514
01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:53.440
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I have,</v>

1515
01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:55.780
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe have molly can I said that.</v>

1516
01:06:56.590 --> 01:06:57.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

1517
01:06:57.671 --> 01:07:00.310
<v Speaker 1>that's an unfortunate characteristic in</v>
<v Speaker 1>men.</v>

1518
01:07:00.460 --> 01:07:02.590
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it probably exists in women too,</v>

1519
01:07:02.591 --> 01:07:04.430
<v Speaker 1>but I see it more in men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1520
01:07:04.450 --> 01:07:06.370
<v Speaker 1>that they will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll always want to be right,</v>

1521
01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:07.060
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1522
01:07:07.060 --> 01:07:10.690
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't make you better to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>information that someone doesn't have.</v>

1523
01:07:10.691 --> 01:07:13.060
<v Speaker 1>Like I like when someone can tell me</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that I don't know.</v>

1524
01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:14.440
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting.</v>

1525
01:07:15.340 --> 01:07:19.210
<v Speaker 1>I suspect that one of the reasons why</v>
<v Speaker 1>your podcast is so successful is because</v>

1526
01:07:19.450 --> 01:07:23.320
<v Speaker 1>you exhibit that generosity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you came to the,</v>

1527
01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:26.350
<v Speaker 1>to every discussion thinking that there</v>
<v Speaker 1>is nothing that the other person could</v>

1528
01:07:26.351 --> 01:07:28.300
<v Speaker 1>bring to the table,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to have a show that's</v>

1529
01:07:28.301 --> 01:07:30.070
<v Speaker 1>going to last long though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's also,</v>

1530
01:07:30.071 --> 01:07:34.480
<v Speaker 1>it's impossible says we're not talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about like the 1950s when people at this</v>

1531
01:07:34.481 --> 01:07:38.140
<v Speaker 1>narrow view of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was defined by their own environment,</v>

1532
01:07:38.190 --> 01:07:38.620
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1533
01:07:38.620 --> 01:07:43.480
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about this broad place now</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you can just access all sorts of</v>

1534
01:07:43.481 --> 01:07:45.430
<v Speaker 1>data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the beautiful things about</v>

1535
01:07:45.431 --> 01:07:49.480
<v Speaker 1>the podcast is by sitting down with</v>
<v Speaker 1>people like you or all the other awesome</v>

1536
01:07:49.481 --> 01:07:54.310
<v Speaker 1>guests I get to sit down with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get to experience the wisdom and the</v>

1537
01:07:54.311 --> 01:07:57.130
<v Speaker 1>information of someone who's lived a</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely different life than me.</v>

1538
01:07:57.550 --> 01:08:02.550
<v Speaker 1>And I just find that really fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I just think that that arrogance</v>

1539
01:08:03.311 --> 01:08:07.750
<v Speaker 1>that someone would display by doing what</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy did to you and switching around</v>

1540
01:08:07.751 --> 01:08:08.590
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your points.</v>

1541
01:08:08.591 --> 01:08:13.591
<v Speaker 1>And just that's just a child that's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a developmental dead end that this</v>

1542
01:08:13.901 --> 01:08:16.760
<v Speaker 1>person went down still.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So unhealthy.</v>

1543
01:08:16.790 --> 01:08:18.500
<v Speaker 1>I hear you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But so common,</v>

1544
01:08:18.501 --> 01:08:19.550
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So common.</v>

1545
01:08:19.850 --> 01:08:21.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's next?</v>

1546
01:08:21.420 --> 01:08:23.810
<v Speaker 1>What do want to talk about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk about your paper that you</v>

1547
01:08:24.170 --> 01:08:25.130
<v Speaker 1>brought up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

1548
01:08:25.131 --> 01:08:27.620
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is a paper that uh,</v>

1549
01:08:27.740 --> 01:08:32.150
<v Speaker 1>I was invited to write and one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>leading journals in the field general</v>

1550
01:08:32.151 --> 01:08:33.800
<v Speaker 1>marketing research,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1551
01:08:33.801 --> 01:08:38.540
<v Speaker 1>where I was asked to talk about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>methods of evolutionary psychology,</v>

1552
01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:41.240
<v Speaker 1>how evolutionary psychologists conduct</v>
<v Speaker 1>research.</v>

1553
01:08:41.750 --> 01:08:46.750
<v Speaker 1>And it was specifically to address some</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the common canards that we hear from</v>

1554
01:08:46.941 --> 01:08:48.620
<v Speaker 1>the tractors of evolution psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1555
01:08:48.621 --> 01:08:50.930
<v Speaker 1>it's all a bunch of post hoc</v>
<v Speaker 1>storytelling and so on.</v>

1556
01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:52.970
<v Speaker 1>And so the paper basically looks at</v>
<v Speaker 1>three points,</v>

1557
01:08:52.971 --> 01:08:54.530
<v Speaker 1>two of which we've already sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>covered.</v>

1558
01:08:54.531 --> 01:08:57.830
<v Speaker 1>One is the distinction between proximate</v>
<v Speaker 1>and ultimate explanations.</v>

1559
01:08:58.250 --> 01:09:00.290
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a very important point to make</v>

1560
01:09:00.291 --> 01:09:04.400
<v Speaker 1>because it basically argues that you'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>never have a full explanation of any</v>

1561
01:09:04.401 --> 01:09:08.480
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon involving biological agents</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't study the phenomenon at</v>

1562
01:09:08.481 --> 01:09:11.930
<v Speaker 1>both the proximate and ultimate level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>approximately how,</v>

1563
01:09:11.931 --> 01:09:15.350
<v Speaker 1>what ultimate is the Darwinian wise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one we've already covered that</v>

1564
01:09:15.351 --> 01:09:18.980
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second method of evolution</v>

1565
01:09:18.990 --> 01:09:22.400
<v Speaker 1>psychology is the building of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>networks of cumulative evidence.</v>

1566
01:09:22.401 --> 01:09:25.010
<v Speaker 1>Like the one I gave you with the waist</v>
<v Speaker 1>to hip ratio.</v>

1567
01:09:25.340 --> 01:09:27.830
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'll give you another one as an</v>

1568
01:09:27.831 --> 01:09:30.410
<v Speaker 1>example of this mechanism.</v>

1569
01:09:31.070 --> 01:09:34.610
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I want to argue that toy preferences</v>

1570
01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:37.970
<v Speaker 1>have sex specificity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is innate,</v>

1571
01:09:38.270 --> 01:09:40.370
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not that cause typically in the</v>

1572
01:09:40.371 --> 01:09:43.490
<v Speaker 1>social sciences we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we hear that what makes little boys,</v>

1573
01:09:43.491 --> 01:09:45.020
<v Speaker 1>little boys and little girls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little girls,</v>

1574
01:09:45.430 --> 01:09:48.830
<v Speaker 1>little girls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that boys are taught to play rough</v>

1575
01:09:48.831 --> 01:09:51.380
<v Speaker 1>with the GI.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe Girls are taught to play gentle with</v>

1576
01:09:51.381 --> 01:09:53.330
<v Speaker 1>the pink thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's dismissed.</v>

1577
01:09:53.390 --> 01:09:53.791
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1578
01:09:53.791 --> 01:09:54.680
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hear that,</v>

1579
01:09:54.681 --> 01:09:57.320
<v Speaker 1>but it's a very fringe in the social</v>
<v Speaker 1>sciences.</v>

1580
01:09:57.350 --> 01:09:57.891
<v Speaker 1>It isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1581
01:09:57.891 --> 01:09:59.510
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still up there.</v>

1582
01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:02.240
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's only because of liberal colleges.</v>

1583
01:10:02.241 --> 01:10:04.190
<v Speaker 1>It's not because of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1584
01:10:04.220 --> 01:10:07.820
<v Speaker 1>it's not people that are objectively</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent that are recognizing us,</v>

1585
01:10:08.270 --> 01:10:12.080
<v Speaker 1>but certainly in terms of the university</v>
<v Speaker 1>landscape that is the dominant,</v>

1586
01:10:12.210 --> 01:10:13.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>navigate.</v>

1587
01:10:13.430 --> 01:10:17.150
<v Speaker 1>What are they uses evidence to point</v>
<v Speaker 1>that men are taught to that because</v>

1588
01:10:17.450 --> 01:10:22.450
<v Speaker 1>they've proven that children absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 1>gravitate just based on gender gravitate</v>

1589
01:10:23.601 --> 01:10:25.670
<v Speaker 1>towards certain types of tasks and toys.</v>

1590
01:10:25.670 --> 01:10:28.280
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I'm going to do next is</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to demonstrate how</v>

1591
01:10:28.670 --> 01:10:32.150
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary psychologists build these</v>
<v Speaker 1>numb logical networks of keen wealth of</v>

1592
01:10:32.151 --> 01:10:34.940
<v Speaker 1>evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I want it to prove that that</v>

1593
01:10:34.941 --> 01:10:38.420
<v Speaker 1>premise that you argued is dismissed is</v>
<v Speaker 1>truly laughable,</v>

1594
01:10:38.421 --> 01:10:40.760
<v Speaker 1>how would I go about them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's one of the things that I</v>

1595
01:10:40.761 --> 01:10:44.480
<v Speaker 1>did in the paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we could look at children who are in</v>

1596
01:10:44.481 --> 01:10:47.450
<v Speaker 1>the pre socialization stage of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitive development,</v>

1597
01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:51.440
<v Speaker 1>meaning that by definition they're too</v>
<v Speaker 1>young to have been socialized and we</v>

1598
01:10:51.441 --> 01:10:53.800
<v Speaker 1>could do studies on them to see what is</v>
<v Speaker 1>it that the,</v>

1599
01:10:53.810 --> 01:10:55.310
<v Speaker 1>that that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1600
01:10:55.490 --> 01:10:58.580
<v Speaker 1>approach first or what is it that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>gaze at longer.</v>

1601
01:10:58.850 --> 01:11:02.480
<v Speaker 1>And we see that there is a sex</v>
<v Speaker 1>specificity in such young children.</v>

1602
01:11:02.481 --> 01:11:05.960
<v Speaker 1>So already it demonstrates that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably not due to socialization.</v>

1603
01:11:05.961 --> 01:11:10.961
<v Speaker 1>So that's evidence line number one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could take other species vervet</v>

1604
01:11:11.331 --> 01:11:14.070
<v Speaker 1>monkeys and rhesus monkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now there's some research</v>

1605
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:18.450
<v Speaker 5>with chimps showing that they exhibit</v>
<v Speaker 5>the same sex specificity.</v>

1606
01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:21.930
<v Speaker 5>Would these types of toys as human</v>
<v Speaker 5>infants do?</v>

1607
01:11:22.420 --> 01:11:27.390
<v Speaker 5>They done number two,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we could take data from a clinical</v>

1608
01:11:27.391 --> 01:11:29.310
<v Speaker 5>population.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there's a this order known as</v>

1609
01:11:29.311 --> 01:11:33.150
<v Speaker 5>congenital adrenal hyperplasia,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is an endocrinological problem</v>

1610
01:11:33.151 --> 01:11:36.990
<v Speaker 5>that masculinized as little girls that</v>
<v Speaker 5>masculinized his little girls,</v>

1611
01:11:36.991 --> 01:11:39.330
<v Speaker 5>both in their morphology but also in</v>
<v Speaker 5>their behaviors.</v>

1612
01:11:39.750 --> 01:11:42.180
<v Speaker 5>So if you take little girls who suffer</v>
<v Speaker 5>from this disorder,</v>

1613
01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:44.250
<v Speaker 5>what do you think happens in their toy</v>
<v Speaker 5>preferences?</v>

1614
01:11:44.310 --> 01:11:46.860
<v Speaker 5>They become more like those of little</v>
<v Speaker 5>boys.</v>

1615
01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:51.360
<v Speaker 5>We could take a depictions on funerary</v>
<v Speaker 5>monuments,</v>

1616
01:11:51.420 --> 01:11:51.990
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1617
01:11:51.990 --> 01:11:54.740
<v Speaker 5>these big mausoleums of that people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1618
01:11:54.810 --> 01:11:57.870
<v Speaker 5>from ancient Greece.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you look at depictions of little</v>

1619
01:11:57.871 --> 01:12:00.840
<v Speaker 5>boys and little girls and you'll see</v>
<v Speaker 5>that the little boys are depicted with</v>

1620
01:12:00.841 --> 01:12:02.190
<v Speaker 5>the typical toys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1621
01:12:02.191 --> 01:12:02.941
<v Speaker 5>with a ball,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with a,</v>

1622
01:12:02.941 --> 01:12:04.080
<v Speaker 5>something with a wheel thing.</v>

1623
01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:07.590
<v Speaker 5>Little girls are depicted with dolls.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could do the studies across a wide</v>

1624
01:12:07.591 --> 01:12:10.740
<v Speaker 5>range of cultures that are very</v>
<v Speaker 5>different from western cultures.</v>

1625
01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:14.100
<v Speaker 5>The phenomenon manifests itself again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so what you do,</v>

1626
01:12:14.101 --> 01:12:17.850
<v Speaker 5>again in evolutionary theory is you</v>
<v Speaker 5>build this normal,</v>

1627
01:12:17.970 --> 01:12:21.120
<v Speaker 5>normal logical network of cumulative</v>
<v Speaker 5>evidence coming from completely</v>

1628
01:12:21.121 --> 01:12:25.860
<v Speaker 5>different data sets that then makes it</v>
<v Speaker 5>unassailable to argue against it.</v>

1629
01:12:26.070 --> 01:12:28.590
<v Speaker 5>So that's the second method of evolution</v>
<v Speaker 5>psychology.</v>

1630
01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:33.180
<v Speaker 5>The third one I argue is a evolutionary</v>
<v Speaker 5>psychology operates on what are,</v>

1631
01:12:33.181 --> 01:12:36.480
<v Speaker 5>what are called consilience trees of</v>
<v Speaker 5>knowledge.</v>

1632
01:12:36.690 --> 01:12:40.290
<v Speaker 5>Consilience is a term that had sort of</v>
<v Speaker 5>lost its way.</v>

1633
01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:42.390
<v Speaker 5>It basically refers to unity of</v>
<v Speaker 5>knowledge.</v>

1634
01:12:42.630 --> 01:12:45.540
<v Speaker 5>So if you say for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>physics is more conciliatory than</v>

1635
01:12:45.541 --> 01:12:48.810
<v Speaker 5>sociology,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's because physics has these organize</v>

1636
01:12:49.170 --> 01:12:52.980
<v Speaker 5>knowledge trees that sociology doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1637
01:12:53.250 --> 01:12:56.010
<v Speaker 5>so what is a typical tree of knowledge</v>
<v Speaker 5>and evolutionary theory?</v>

1638
01:12:56.011 --> 01:12:58.320
<v Speaker 5>So you could start with something like</v>
<v Speaker 5>sexual selection.</v>

1639
01:12:58.500 --> 01:13:01.470
<v Speaker 5>Sexual selection is basically the idea</v>
<v Speaker 5>that how do,</v>

1640
01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:03.510
<v Speaker 5>how does a peacock evolve?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a big tail.</v>

1641
01:13:03.570 --> 01:13:06.600
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so how do animals evolve their traits to</v>

1642
01:13:06.601 --> 01:13:10.290
<v Speaker 5>give them reproductive advantage?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's been established from the time of</v>

1643
01:13:10.291 --> 01:13:12.450
<v Speaker 5>Darwin through a million different</v>
<v Speaker 5>species.</v>

1644
01:13:12.570 --> 01:13:16.230
<v Speaker 5>So now that leads to down the tree to</v>
<v Speaker 5>another theory.</v>

1645
01:13:16.231 --> 01:13:18.840
<v Speaker 5>It's called the mid level theory called</v>
<v Speaker 5>parental investment theory.</v>

1646
01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:22.380
<v Speaker 5>Parental investment theory basically</v>
<v Speaker 5>says that if you want to know about sex</v>

1647
01:13:22.381 --> 01:13:25.080
<v Speaker 5>differences within a species,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look at the minimal,</v>

1648
01:13:25.170 --> 01:13:29.100
<v Speaker 5>I would look at Dory parental investment</v>
<v Speaker 5>that each sex has to have in that</v>

1649
01:13:29.101 --> 01:13:32.550
<v Speaker 5>species.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So in most species it's the female that</v>

1650
01:13:32.551 --> 01:13:35.670
<v Speaker 5>has more parental investment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So typically they're smaller.</v>

1651
01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:38.730
<v Speaker 5>It's the males who fight for access to</v>
<v Speaker 5>females.</v>

1652
01:13:38.970 --> 01:13:41.520
<v Speaker 5>Females are more careful about the May</v>
<v Speaker 5>choices they make.</v>

1653
01:13:41.730 --> 01:13:45.750
<v Speaker 5>But you also have sex role reversal</v>
<v Speaker 5>species where it's as the males who have</v>

1654
01:13:45.751 --> 01:13:46.920
<v Speaker 5>greater parental investment.</v>

1655
01:13:47.070 --> 01:13:49.110
<v Speaker 5>What do you think happens to the sex</v>
<v Speaker 5>differences there?</v>

1656
01:13:49.111 --> 01:13:50.610
<v Speaker 5>Exactly reversed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1657
01:13:50.850 --> 01:13:53.490
<v Speaker 5>So that has been also established.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So now we go down.</v>

1658
01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:58.110
<v Speaker 5>Parental investment theory leads to</v>
<v Speaker 5>another theory that basically says that</v>

1659
01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:03.660
<v Speaker 5>in the human context females will make</v>
<v Speaker 5>more judicious may choices than men.</v>

1660
01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:06.360
<v Speaker 5>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 5>women are more careful and the types of</v>

1661
01:14:06.361 --> 01:14:10.800
<v Speaker 5>make choices that they must make</v>
<v Speaker 5>precisely because they have greater</v>

1662
01:14:11.620 --> 01:14:13.870
<v Speaker 5>costs if they make a wrong may think</v>
<v Speaker 5>choice,</v>

1663
01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:18.310
<v Speaker 5>which leads to a study that I did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Looking at how much information the men</v>

1664
01:14:18.311 --> 01:14:22.240
<v Speaker 5>and women look at before they either</v>
<v Speaker 5>reject mates or choose mates.</v>

1665
01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:25.840
<v Speaker 5>And what do you think the results shows</v>
<v Speaker 5>when it comes to rejecting mates?</v>

1666
01:14:26.110 --> 01:14:28.420
<v Speaker 5>Women need less convincing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In other words,</v>

1667
01:14:28.421 --> 01:14:31.060
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they acquire less information before</v>

1668
01:14:31.061 --> 01:14:34.210
<v Speaker 5>they decide all these mates are losers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>On the other hand,</v>

1669
01:14:34.211 --> 01:14:38.920
<v Speaker 5>when it comes to choosing a mate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>women look at more information prior to</v>

1670
01:14:38.921 --> 01:14:39.610
<v Speaker 5>choosing.</v>

1671
01:14:39.610 --> 01:14:43.570
<v Speaker 5>So what I've shown you here is how you</v>
<v Speaker 5>start with a general principle and work</v>

1672
01:14:43.571 --> 01:14:48.400
<v Speaker 5>down a tree to a specific hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's called a tree of knowledge of</v>

1673
01:14:48.401 --> 01:14:51.250
<v Speaker 5>evolutionary theory.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what the method of evolutionary</v>

1674
01:14:52.090 --> 01:14:55.510
<v Speaker 5>psychology is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So contrary to what typical the</v>

1675
01:14:55.511 --> 01:14:56.890
<v Speaker 5>tractors,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there'll be some buffoon,</v>

1676
01:14:56.891 --> 01:14:58.550
<v Speaker 5>some customer data on your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1677
01:14:58.670 --> 01:15:00.340
<v Speaker 5>at the bottom of your comments section</v>
<v Speaker 5>that says,</v>

1678
01:15:00.550 --> 01:15:03.600
<v Speaker 5>but evolutionary sciences,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's not a real solid mckinnis</v>

1679
01:15:03.730 --> 01:15:04.780
<v Speaker 5>toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1680
01:15:05.230 --> 01:15:06.550
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's hilarious.</v>

1681
01:15:06.551 --> 01:15:07.121
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you liked that,</v>

1682
01:15:07.121 --> 01:15:10.210
<v Speaker 5>huh?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the turn out of that is good.</v>

1683
01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:12.760
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>singers and other balls chopped off.</v>

1684
01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:17.020
<v Speaker 5>I usually call him the Castrati brigade</v>
<v Speaker 5>and of course in the singular form,</v>

1685
01:15:17.021 --> 01:15:17.920
<v Speaker 5>that's gus throttle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1686
01:15:18.130 --> 01:15:20.520
<v Speaker 5>So it's a guy who walks around without</v>
<v Speaker 5>testes,</v>

1687
01:15:20.530 --> 01:15:23.230
<v Speaker 5>but a very inflated ego who then tells</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

1688
01:15:23.490 --> 01:15:25.150
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>despite the fact that you've spent 20</v>

1689
01:15:25.151 --> 01:15:27.370
<v Speaker 5>plus years studying something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he knows more than you.</v>

1690
01:15:27.371 --> 01:15:29.620
<v Speaker 5>All of you evolutionary scientists are</v>
<v Speaker 5>full in order.</v>

1691
01:15:30.170 --> 01:15:30.890
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1692
01:15:30.890 --> 01:15:35.510
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting to me that there would</v>
<v Speaker 3>be people that would be involved in</v>

1693
01:15:35.511 --> 01:15:40.511
<v Speaker 3>universities that would debate this sort</v>
<v Speaker 3>of very objective research.</v>

1694
01:15:42.770 --> 01:15:43.640
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1695
01:15:43.641 --> 01:15:45.450
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially when it comes to gender and</v>

1696
01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:48.930
<v Speaker 3>obviously there's variables,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when it comes to the,</v>

1697
01:15:48.940 --> 01:15:51.980
<v Speaker 3>the gravitating towards certain types of</v>
<v Speaker 3>toys and tasks and,</v>

1698
01:15:52.180 --> 01:15:55.100
<v Speaker 3>and then it also pertains to career</v>
<v Speaker 3>choices as well.</v>

1699
01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:59.390
<v Speaker 3>Like there's this big push to get women</v>
<v Speaker 3>involved in stem and women involved in</v>

1700
01:15:59.391 --> 01:16:01.880
<v Speaker 3>technology and other th there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>discrimination.</v>

1701
01:16:01.881 --> 01:16:02.714
<v Speaker 3>Women in tech,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1702
01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:04.880
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>w women don't gravitate towards those</v>

1703
01:16:04.881 --> 01:16:06.830
<v Speaker 3>particular jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to do them.</v>

1704
01:16:06.950 --> 01:16:08.660
<v Speaker 3>Some do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the ones that do,</v>

1705
01:16:08.661 --> 01:16:11.720
<v Speaker 3>they cry sexism because there's so few</v>
<v Speaker 3>of them.</v>

1706
01:16:12.020 --> 01:16:12.890
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's just no,</v>

1707
01:16:12.891 --> 01:16:16.130
<v Speaker 3>it's just not something that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>naturally gravitate towards.</v>

1708
01:16:16.131 --> 01:16:16.964
<v Speaker 3>Overwhelming.</v>

1709
01:16:17.170 --> 01:16:17.770
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what,</v>

1710
01:16:17.770 --> 01:16:21.310
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if you remember the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the whole debacle with Larry Summers,</v>

1711
01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:25.690
<v Speaker 5>who was the president of Harvard</v>
<v Speaker 5>University who then became,</v>

1712
01:16:25.860 --> 01:16:27.550
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if he was in the Obama</v>
<v Speaker 5>administration,</v>

1713
01:16:27.551 --> 01:16:30.340
<v Speaker 5>but here's this guy who was president of</v>
<v Speaker 5>Harvard University.</v>

1714
01:16:30.341 --> 01:16:33.580
<v Speaker 5>He was giving a speech,</v>
<v Speaker 5>probably Jamie can pull it up if he has</v>

1715
01:16:33.581 --> 01:16:34.540
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1716
01:16:35.140 --> 01:16:40.140
<v Speaker 5>and he was basically giving a talk where</v>
<v Speaker 5>he hinted to exactly what you said.</v>

1717
01:16:40.241 --> 01:16:41.830
<v Speaker 5>He said that he didn't say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1718
01:16:41.831 --> 01:16:44.440
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>women don't have the capacity to get</v>

1719
01:16:44.441 --> 01:16:45.490
<v Speaker 5>into these fields.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1720
01:16:45.491 --> 01:16:49.000
<v Speaker 5>I think he hinted to exactly what your</v>
<v Speaker 5>sensitive then they might not like it as</v>

1721
01:16:49.001 --> 01:16:51.280
<v Speaker 5>much.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Despite these very aggressive programs</v>

1722
01:16:51.281 --> 01:16:53.530
<v Speaker 5>that we've instituted to try to attract</v>
<v Speaker 5>women,</v>

1723
01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:57.760
<v Speaker 5>maybe they're not drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just hinting at that led him to</v>

1724
01:16:57.761 --> 01:17:01.150
<v Speaker 5>eventually stepping down as president of</v>
<v Speaker 5>Harvard.</v>

1725
01:17:01.660 --> 01:17:04.510
<v Speaker 3>It's a real problem in colleges and</v>
<v Speaker 3>universities today with that,</v>

1726
01:17:04.540 --> 01:17:08.230
<v Speaker 3>with this denial of reality to her to</v>
<v Speaker 3>help other people's feelings,</v>

1727
01:17:08.231 --> 01:17:10.490
<v Speaker 3>where to make other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to placate other people's feelings.</v>

1728
01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:15.260
<v Speaker 3>And it's also this repeating that even</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obama has been involved in repeating</v>

1729
01:17:15.261 --> 01:17:20.070
<v Speaker 3>this myth that women working the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>job make 77 cents for every dollar that</v>

1730
01:17:20.071 --> 01:17:22.070
<v Speaker 3>a man makes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not true.</v>

1731
01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:24.350
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you've ever researched</v>
<v Speaker 3>that or gone into that.</v>

1732
01:17:24.351 --> 01:17:25.820
<v Speaker 3>So I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know from two sources,</v>

1733
01:17:25.821 --> 01:17:28.220
<v Speaker 3>the only two sources that I've sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>paid attention to that have addressed</v>

1734
01:17:28.221 --> 01:17:30.740
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think as Milo Yiannopoulos,</v>

1735
01:17:30.741 --> 01:17:33.290
<v Speaker 3>who's sort of been one of the big</v>
<v Speaker 3>champions to try to dismantle that</v>

1736
01:17:33.291 --> 01:17:34.460
<v Speaker 3>narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it's just,</v>

1737
01:17:34.490 --> 01:17:37.730
<v Speaker 3>it's been dismantled by sociologists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has been dismantled.</v>

1738
01:17:37.750 --> 01:17:38.840
<v Speaker 3>Dena hoff summers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1739
01:17:38.900 --> 01:17:40.220
<v Speaker 3>Did it so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

1740
01:17:40.221 --> 01:17:40.491
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1741
01:17:40.491 --> 01:17:41.660
<v Speaker 3>I think you're exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1742
01:17:41.661 --> 01:17:43.670
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the data is wrong.</v>

1743
01:17:43.690 --> 01:17:45.770
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's totally misinterpreted.</v>

1744
01:17:45.771 --> 01:17:49.820
<v Speaker 3>The real data is when you look at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>overall wealth,</v>

1745
01:17:50.030 --> 01:17:52.430
<v Speaker 3>like what men make versus what women</v>
<v Speaker 3>make.</v>

1746
01:17:52.460 --> 01:17:55.850
<v Speaker 3>Men make more money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they also work more hours.</v>

1747
01:17:55.910 --> 01:17:59.660
<v Speaker 3>They also choose different jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They also are at a higher risk to die on</v>

1748
01:17:59.661 --> 01:18:01.460
<v Speaker 3>the job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's all of these different factors.</v>

1749
01:18:01.790 --> 01:18:05.780
<v Speaker 3>The misconception is that a man and a</v>
<v Speaker 3>woman working side by side doing the</v>

1750
01:18:05.781 --> 01:18:09.050
<v Speaker 3>same job that the woman is making 77</v>
<v Speaker 3>cents to the man's dollar.</v>

1751
01:18:09.260 --> 01:18:10.940
<v Speaker 3>That is not true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly right.</v>

1752
01:18:10.941 --> 01:18:13.460
<v Speaker 3>And that's the problem with this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And even fucking Obama,</v>

1753
01:18:13.890 --> 01:18:16.310
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he parroted that and Sarah Silverman did</v>

1754
01:18:16.311 --> 01:18:17.510
<v Speaker 3>it recently,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of those,</v>

1755
01:18:17.511 --> 01:18:20.030
<v Speaker 3>Hillary Clinton's speech is talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about how women make less than men.</v>

1756
01:18:20.270 --> 01:18:21.680
<v Speaker 3>It's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1757
01:18:21.890 --> 01:18:25.640
<v Speaker 3>But it's one of those things that if you</v>
<v Speaker 3>tell people they don't believe you,</v>

1758
01:18:25.850 --> 01:18:28.220
<v Speaker 3>like you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to send them studies and then</v>

1759
01:18:28.221 --> 01:18:31.430
<v Speaker 3>they read it and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have this myth has been perpetrated</v>

1760
01:18:31.431 --> 01:18:33.200
<v Speaker 3>so pervasively.</v>

1761
01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:37.490
<v Speaker 3>It's so common that people parrot it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one questions it.</v>

1762
01:18:37.670 --> 01:18:42.670
<v Speaker 3>The fucking president parrots it on</v>
<v Speaker 3>television like intellectually that is</v>

1763
01:18:43.221 --> 01:18:46.010
<v Speaker 3>so incredibly dishonest for him to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1764
01:18:46.011 --> 01:18:50.030
<v Speaker 3>If he is aware of the actual stats and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he says that just because he knows</v>

1765
01:18:50.031 --> 01:18:51.770
<v Speaker 3>that's what people want to hear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1766
01:18:51.771 --> 01:18:53.390
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obama does care.</v>

1767
01:18:53.630 --> 01:18:56.450
<v Speaker 3>He is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's caring and sympathetic and he's not</v>

1768
01:18:56.451 --> 01:18:57.580
<v Speaker 3>a pig.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1769
01:18:57.581 --> 01:19:01.160
<v Speaker 3>similar narrative has been proposed and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could probably could fill in the</v>

1770
01:19:01.161 --> 01:19:03.620
<v Speaker 3>details regarding the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the number is.</v>

1771
01:19:03.740 --> 01:19:07.820
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one in five women on university campuses</v>

1772
01:19:07.850 --> 01:19:12.800
<v Speaker 3>will experience a sexual assault.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is a ridiculous stat that is,</v>

1773
01:19:13.370 --> 01:19:17.870
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that that's not the ice did</v>
<v Speaker 3>define sexual assault.</v>

1774
01:19:17.900 --> 01:19:22.490
<v Speaker 3>If it's a guy making an an an unwanted</v>
<v Speaker 3>grope,</v>

1775
01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:25.700
<v Speaker 3>you know that a guy moves in for a kiss</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he doesn't,</v>

1776
01:19:25.790 --> 01:19:27.320
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you're dealing with a lot of</v>

1777
01:19:27.321 --> 01:19:28.460
<v Speaker 3>awkward kids.</v>

1778
01:19:28.730 --> 01:19:32.690
<v Speaker 3>They're drunk and they do stupid shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>and some of it easily could be sexual</v>

1779
01:19:32.691 --> 01:19:35.150
<v Speaker 3>assault or sexual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1780
01:19:35.250 --> 01:19:36.660
<v Speaker 3>in propriety.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1781
01:19:36.661 --> 01:19:38.720
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't necessarily think that that</v>

1782
01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:42.440
<v Speaker 3>number's off so that I think rape is</v>
<v Speaker 3>much more,</v>

1783
01:19:42.500 --> 01:19:45.350
<v Speaker 3>much more complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that then I think you're talking</v>

1784
01:19:45.351 --> 01:19:47.570
<v Speaker 3>about something way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>way more.</v>

1785
01:19:47.630 --> 01:19:51.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm way less common,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but way more disturbing.</v>

1786
01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:53.140
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the,</v>

1787
01:19:53.141 --> 01:19:57.950
<v Speaker 3>the real re the real statistics about</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many women get raped or I'm way</v>

1788
01:19:57.951 --> 01:20:01.880
<v Speaker 3>different than what is being proposed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem is you start talking about</v>

1789
01:20:01.881 --> 01:20:06.650
<v Speaker 3>things like an unwanted grope or someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>slapping someone in the ass that that</v>

1790
01:20:06.651 --> 01:20:07.830
<v Speaker 3>all gets factored in.</v>

1791
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:12.060
<v Speaker 4>Then they start factoring in things like</v>
<v Speaker 4>having sex while intoxicated and that</v>

1792
01:20:12.061 --> 01:20:17.061
<v Speaker 4>becomes sexual assault.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But conveniently only for the man to be</v>

1793
01:20:17.461 --> 01:20:22.461
<v Speaker 4>the one who's the sexual assault or like</v>
<v Speaker 4>if a woman is sober in the man is drunk,</v>

1794
01:20:22.681 --> 01:20:27.090
<v Speaker 4>no one has ever accusing the woman of</v>
<v Speaker 4>being a rapist by having sex with a</v>

1795
01:20:27.091 --> 01:20:28.260
<v Speaker 4>drunk man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1796
01:20:28.290 --> 01:20:29.160
<v Speaker 4>Have we talked,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1797
01:20:29.161 --> 01:20:31.410
<v Speaker 4>speaking of very private,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure if we've discussed it on</v>

1798
01:20:31.411 --> 01:20:32.790
<v Speaker 4>the show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that'd be discussed,</v>

1799
01:20:32.791 --> 01:20:36.450
<v Speaker 4>the rape by fraud story of this show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

1800
01:20:36.570 --> 01:20:39.210
<v Speaker 4>we have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well there's also the new laws that are</v>

1801
01:20:39.211 --> 01:20:42.180
<v Speaker 4>being passed rate by fraud,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a fascinating,</v>

1802
01:20:42.181 --> 01:20:44.220
<v Speaker 4>like if a guy says he's a prince and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

1803
01:20:44.250 --> 01:20:48.030
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to take you to my council,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you will live in luxury forever.</v>

1804
01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:49.620
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he's really not a prince.</v>

1805
01:20:49.621 --> 01:20:52.710
<v Speaker 4>That guy can get charged with rape.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are your thoughts on that?</v>

1806
01:20:53.970 --> 01:20:55.110
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the guy's a piece of shit.</v>

1807
01:20:55.440 --> 01:20:58.560
<v Speaker 4>So Amal be arrested as a rapist?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1808
01:20:58.590 --> 01:21:00.300
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he is definitely a liar.</v>

1809
01:21:00.301 --> 01:21:00.731
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1810
01:21:00.731 --> 01:21:03.900
<v Speaker 4>it's really tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like what is he doing exactly?</v>

1811
01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:05.970
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's being a liar.</v>

1812
01:21:05.971 --> 01:21:09.000
<v Speaker 4>He's telling a story that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And because of that,</v>

1813
01:21:09.001 --> 01:21:11.250
<v Speaker 4>of girls having sex with him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's immortal.</v>

1814
01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:13.830
<v Speaker 4>He's unethical.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's reprehensible behavior.</v>

1815
01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:16.410
<v Speaker 4>He's not criminal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Criminal.</v>

1816
01:21:16.411 --> 01:21:19.230
<v Speaker 4>Because if that were criminal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as I think I might've mentioned on your</v>

1817
01:21:19.231 --> 01:21:23.010
<v Speaker 4>show before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>95% of people who are engaged in online</v>

1818
01:21:23.011 --> 01:21:24.630
<v Speaker 4>dating are rapists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1819
01:21:24.660 --> 01:21:25.300
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

1820
01:21:25.300 --> 01:21:27.570
<v Speaker 4>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And also a lot of guys will lie to</v>

1821
01:21:27.571 --> 01:21:28.950
<v Speaker 4>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the raping themselves,</v>

1822
01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:31.040
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pretending they really loved that one.</v>

1823
01:21:31.041 --> 01:21:33.510
<v Speaker 4>When I tell it now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>musterbation is raping yourself even</v>

1824
01:21:33.650 --> 01:21:34.920
<v Speaker 4>mean masturbation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1825
01:21:34.921 --> 01:21:36.160
<v Speaker 4>having sex with someone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't really,</v>

1826
01:21:36.161 --> 01:21:38.760
<v Speaker 4>you're not really attracted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just horny as fuck and you convince</v>

1827
01:21:38.761 --> 01:21:39.880
<v Speaker 4>yourself this is the right girl.</v>

1828
01:21:40.210 --> 01:21:41.430
<v Speaker 4>And then as soon as your orgasm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

1829
01:21:41.460 --> 01:21:44.160
<v Speaker 4>I gotta get the Fuck Outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just wrote myself.</v>

1830
01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:45.510
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

1831
01:21:45.511 --> 01:21:48.090
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's something immoral about it.</v>

1832
01:21:48.091 --> 01:21:50.130
<v Speaker 4>There's something unethical about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it,</v>

1833
01:21:50.150 --> 01:21:54.420
<v Speaker 4>it becomes very tricky when you try to</v>
<v Speaker 4>decide whether or not that's a crime.</v>

1834
01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:56.280
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or you want to prosecute someone for</v>

1835
01:21:56.281 --> 01:21:57.570
<v Speaker 4>rape,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for doing something like that.</v>

1836
01:21:57.870 --> 01:22:02.520
<v Speaker 4>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's weird because presumably the woman</v>

1837
01:22:02.521 --> 01:22:04.350
<v Speaker 4>had sex with that man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1838
01:22:04.410 --> 01:22:09.000
<v Speaker 4>voluntarily and enjoyed it and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>decided she didn't enjoy it when she</v>

1839
01:22:09.001 --> 01:22:12.780
<v Speaker 4>realized that guy was crazy or a liar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that just like a lesson?</v>

1840
01:22:13.070 --> 01:22:16.680
<v Speaker 4>Like isn't that just a life lesson and</v>
<v Speaker 4>now you're going to go and be way more</v>

1841
01:22:16.681 --> 01:22:18.480
<v Speaker 4>picky with who you decide to have sex</v>
<v Speaker 4>with?</v>

1842
01:22:18.481 --> 01:22:18.901
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1843
01:22:18.901 --> 01:22:19.890
<v Speaker 4>think of it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1844
01:22:19.891 --> 01:22:21.870
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's link it back to evolutionary</v>

1845
01:22:21.871 --> 01:22:24.300
<v Speaker 4>theory,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not just in the human context,</v>

1846
01:22:24.301 --> 01:22:26.010
<v Speaker 4>but across the animal kingdom.</v>

1847
01:22:26.010 --> 01:22:28.930
<v Speaker 4>There's endless manifestations of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>set of signaling,</v>

1848
01:22:29.060 --> 01:22:30.200
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

1849
01:22:30.570 --> 01:22:34.020
<v Speaker 4>Animals including engage in deceptive</v>
<v Speaker 4>signaling,</v>

1850
01:22:34.050 --> 01:22:34.740
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1851
01:22:34.740 --> 01:22:36.680
<v Speaker 4>he's an example that doesn't relate to</v>
<v Speaker 4>me thing.</v>

1852
01:22:36.990 --> 01:22:38.580
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>apple somatic colorings,</v>

1853
01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:40.620
<v Speaker 4>which is basically warning colors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1854
01:22:40.890 --> 01:22:45.180
<v Speaker 4>So you have a species of say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Amazonian frog that has very vivid</v>

1855
01:22:45.181 --> 01:22:46.200
<v Speaker 4>colors.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

1856
01:22:46.410 --> 01:22:47.520
<v Speaker 4>Why would it be vivid?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1857
01:22:47.521 --> 01:22:49.470
<v Speaker 4>because it is advertising to everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

1858
01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:51.360
<v Speaker 4>don't approach me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm very venomous.</v>

1859
01:22:51.361 --> 01:22:53.610
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well then there'll be another species of</v>

1860
01:22:53.611 --> 01:22:58.611
<v Speaker 4>frog that piggybacks on that coloring.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That actually itself is not at all</v>

1861
01:22:58.710 --> 01:23:03.710
<v Speaker 4>venomous but yet because it is a Serp,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this signal now nobody will attack it,</v>

1862
01:23:04.500 --> 01:23:05.590
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh boy.</v>

1863
01:23:05.591 --> 01:23:06.040
<v Speaker 4>What a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what</v>

1864
01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:06.940
<v Speaker 1>a fraud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What it right.</v>

1865
01:23:07.060 --> 01:23:08.110
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the idea,</v>

1866
01:23:08.260 --> 01:23:11.770
<v Speaker 1>and again I don't want to receive</v>
<v Speaker 1>comments now that I support lying and so</v>

1867
01:23:11.890 --> 01:23:14.110
<v Speaker 1>it is reprehensible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is unethical,</v>

1868
01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:17.500
<v Speaker 1>it is immoral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't do the behavior of course,</v>

1869
01:23:17.530 --> 01:23:20.830
<v Speaker 1>but it's part of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People lie to one another.</v>

1870
01:23:20.860 --> 01:23:23.160
<v Speaker 1>People lie to themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I might've mentioned on this</v>

1871
01:23:23.161 --> 01:23:25.090
<v Speaker 1>show before and even if I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1872
01:23:25.180 --> 01:23:26.620
<v Speaker 1>it's worth repeating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1873
01:23:26.621 --> 01:23:29.440
<v Speaker 1>there's a gentleman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very famous biologist by the name of</v>

1874
01:23:29.441 --> 01:23:32.170
<v Speaker 1>Robert trevors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've talked about the evolutionary</v>

1875
01:23:32.171 --> 01:23:33.880
<v Speaker 1>roots of self deception,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1876
01:23:34.060 --> 01:23:38.830
<v Speaker 1>Why is it that we deceive ourselves?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the argument there is that the</v>

1877
01:23:38.831 --> 01:23:43.180
<v Speaker 1>reason why I have to first believe in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lie before selling it to you is</v>

1878
01:23:43.181 --> 01:23:46.990
<v Speaker 1>because when I lie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually have these micro expressions</v>

1879
01:23:47.260 --> 01:23:49.870
<v Speaker 1>that serve as tale tale signs of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>line.</v>

1880
01:23:50.110 --> 01:23:53.620
<v Speaker 1>If I could suppress these so that when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to look at my face to see</v>

1881
01:23:53.621 --> 01:23:56.410
<v Speaker 1>if there are any signatures of deception</v>
<v Speaker 1>on my face,</v>

1882
01:23:56.560 --> 01:23:59.110
<v Speaker 1>you won't read them because I've already</v>
<v Speaker 1>lied to myself.</v>

1883
01:23:59.350 --> 01:24:03.370
<v Speaker 1>And so they are even clear evolutionary</v>
<v Speaker 1>adaptive reasons for why we lie to</v>

1884
01:24:03.371 --> 01:24:05.350
<v Speaker 1>ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nevermind lying to others.</v>

1885
01:24:05.620 --> 01:24:10.620
<v Speaker 1>So lying and deception is part of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>large repertoire of human behaviors.</v>

1886
01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:14.190
<v Speaker 1>And to call somebody a rapist for</v>
<v Speaker 1>engaging in that represents that we'd</v>

1887
01:24:14.191 --> 01:24:16.390
<v Speaker 1>behavior it does nobody any good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

1888
01:24:16.420 --> 01:24:21.190
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now deception also has to be defined</v>

1889
01:24:21.310 --> 01:24:25.900
<v Speaker 1>like lying and rape by deception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like at what level are we still calling</v>

1890
01:24:25.901 --> 01:24:28.930
<v Speaker 1>it rape by deception?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if a guy has a fake rolex on,</v>

1891
01:24:28.990 --> 01:24:29.890
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1892
01:24:29.891 --> 01:24:32.980
<v Speaker 1>and he's advertising that he's wealthy</v>
<v Speaker 1>when in fact he's not,</v>

1893
01:24:33.420 --> 01:24:36.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when a guy pretends he's making $100,000</v>

1894
01:24:36.461 --> 01:24:39.040
<v Speaker 1>a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it really makes 45 let's make it</v>

1895
01:24:39.041 --> 01:24:40.480
<v Speaker 1>less fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's make it more fuzzy.</v>

1896
01:24:40.510 --> 01:24:43.510
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about if I am actually a very,</v>

1897
01:24:43.900 --> 01:24:47.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apathetic guy who can't get out of bed</v>

1898
01:24:47.561 --> 01:24:51.820
<v Speaker 1>till 11 o'clock in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yet I convince whomever I'm going</v>

1899
01:24:51.821 --> 01:24:55.420
<v Speaker 1>out with that I have this infinite</v>
<v Speaker 1>bottled up ambition.</v>

1900
01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:59.080
<v Speaker 1>So not even faking the Rolex watch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not a tangible thing.</v>

1901
01:24:59.380 --> 01:25:03.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm just sending her cues that I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 1>places that all great ideas.</v>

1902
01:25:03.611 --> 01:25:07.150
<v Speaker 1>I've got a lot of entrepreneurial spunk</v>
<v Speaker 1>and my workout every day.</v>

1903
01:25:07.180 --> 01:25:10.980
<v Speaker 1>I worked with drink wheat grass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm super healthy or meditate and soda</v>

1904
01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:12.280
<v Speaker 1>my rapist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1905
01:25:12.310 --> 01:25:14.710
<v Speaker 1>that's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like who are you?</v>

1906
01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:16.720
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always tell guys,</v>

1907
01:25:16.750 --> 01:25:19.210
<v Speaker 1>you should aspire to be the man you</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretend to be when you're trying to get</v>

1908
01:25:19.211 --> 01:25:21.280
<v Speaker 1>laid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you could just do they just be</v>

1909
01:25:21.281 --> 01:25:23.560
<v Speaker 1>that guy all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't really,</v>

1910
01:25:23.561 --> 01:25:24.970
<v Speaker 1>it's the best way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1911
01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:26.170
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

1912
01:25:26.171 --> 01:25:27.170
<v Speaker 1>that is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>

1913
01:25:27.171 --> 01:25:28.720
<v Speaker 1>Like that is deceptive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1914
01:25:28.721 --> 01:25:30.790
<v Speaker 1>If he's pretending to have all this</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

1915
01:25:30.791 --> 01:25:32.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>admirable behavior,</v>

1916
01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:37.240
<v Speaker 1>one on one fakes orgasm and makes you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think that you're a great lover and you</v>

1917
01:25:37.241 --> 01:25:39.650
<v Speaker 1>have sex with her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's alive.</v>

1918
01:25:39.670 --> 01:25:41.980
<v Speaker 1>She raped me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then I had sex with her.</v>

1919
01:25:42.220 --> 01:25:46.030
<v Speaker 1>It was under the misconception that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a great love of the first time when</v>

1920
01:25:46.031 --> 01:25:48.640
<v Speaker 1>she faked an orgasm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she's raping me that second time.</v>

1921
01:25:48.820 --> 01:25:51.220
<v Speaker 1>Now when you were talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary psychology,</v>

1922
01:25:51.221 --> 01:25:53.610
<v Speaker 1>receiving a lot of criticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1923
01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:54.640
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is this?</v>

1924
01:25:54.690 --> 01:25:56.860
<v Speaker 1>You and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you sort of glossed over it real quickly</v>

1925
01:25:56.861 --> 01:25:59.230
<v Speaker 1>to make your point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like where's the,</v>

1926
01:25:59.290 --> 01:26:01.390
<v Speaker 1>where's the vast majority of this coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>from?</v>

1927
01:26:01.570 --> 01:26:02.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a great question.</v>

1928
01:26:02.471 --> 01:26:03.860
<v Speaker 1>So it comes from</v>

1929
01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:06.590
<v Speaker 5>different camps for different reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1930
01:26:06.620 --> 01:26:07.640
<v Speaker 5>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so let's start,</v>

1931
01:26:07.641 --> 01:26:09.050
<v Speaker 5>let's kind of break them up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1932
01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:12.290
<v Speaker 5>So we can go to the religious folks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1933
01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:15.980
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's obvious though,</v>
<v Speaker 5>isn't it obvious that they would be the</v>

1934
01:26:16.140 --> 01:26:18.470
<v Speaker 5>track?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Obviously they're not going to look at</v>

1935
01:26:18.471 --> 01:26:20.150
<v Speaker 5>things realistically because they have</v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

1936
01:26:20.151 --> 01:26:23.660
<v Speaker 5>that blind spot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's talk about like professors,</v>

1937
01:26:23.810 --> 01:26:26.540
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So then the professors typically will be</v>

1938
01:26:26.780 --> 01:26:28.370
<v Speaker 5>one of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>against several types.</v>

1939
01:26:28.371 --> 01:26:32.690
<v Speaker 5>They'll be the social constructivists.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those are the guys who believe that</v>

1940
01:26:32.691 --> 01:26:36.410
<v Speaker 5>everything's due to social construction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That what makes us human is that we</v>

1941
01:26:36.411 --> 01:26:38.180
<v Speaker 5>transcend our biology,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1942
01:26:38.460 --> 01:26:39.770
<v Speaker 5>It's an argument for that though,</v>
<v Speaker 5>isn't it?</v>

1943
01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:42.040
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we don't transcend our bile.</v>

1944
01:26:42.050 --> 01:26:45.470
<v Speaker 5>We were not strictly biological animals</v>
<v Speaker 5>would biological and cultural,</v>

1945
01:26:45.471 --> 01:26:47.930
<v Speaker 5>but we certainly can't negate our</v>
<v Speaker 5>biology,</v>

1946
01:26:47.950 --> 01:26:50.150
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What they're basically arguing is that</v>

1947
01:26:50.151 --> 01:26:54.680
<v Speaker 5>what differentiates us from all other</v>
<v Speaker 5>life forms is that we transcend our</v>

1948
01:26:54.681 --> 01:26:55.730
<v Speaker 5>biology,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1949
01:26:55.910 --> 01:26:58.580
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so they're perfectly fine if you use an</v>

1950
01:26:58.581 --> 01:27:03.581
<v Speaker 5>evolutionary explanation to explain the</v>
<v Speaker 5>behavior of the mating behavior of the</v>

1951
01:27:04.311 --> 01:27:07.310
<v Speaker 5>salamander,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but don't apply that exact same</v>

1952
01:27:07.311 --> 01:27:09.200
<v Speaker 5>phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What are the flies to humans,</v>

1953
01:27:09.550 --> 01:27:11.540
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because somehow we have,</v>

1954
01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:12.410
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1955
01:27:12.410 --> 01:27:15.490
<v Speaker 5>consciousness and we have higher order</v>
<v Speaker 5>thinking and we're called church</v>

1956
01:27:15.610 --> 01:27:17.240
<v Speaker 5>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's what makes us human,</v>

1957
01:27:17.420 --> 01:27:18.171
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1958
01:27:18.171 --> 01:27:19.610
<v Speaker 5>there are guys who,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

1959
01:27:20.810 --> 01:27:23.690
<v Speaker 5>professors who believed that evolution</v>
<v Speaker 5>stops at the neck,</v>

1960
01:27:23.930 --> 01:27:26.570
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so they're perfectly happy with a,</v>

1961
01:27:26.571 --> 01:27:31.400
<v Speaker 5>you offering an evolutionary explanation</v>
<v Speaker 5>for why we fingernails where we evolve</v>

1962
01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:33.320
<v Speaker 5>opposable thumbs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's fine.</v>

1963
01:27:33.410 --> 01:27:35.600
<v Speaker 5>Why we've evolved the particular,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1964
01:27:36.110 --> 01:27:40.400
<v Speaker 5>pancreas that we have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but don't apply it to anything above the</v>

1965
01:27:40.401 --> 01:27:41.520
<v Speaker 5>neck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not dumbo.</v>

1966
01:27:41.620 --> 01:27:44.540
<v Speaker 5>How behavior patterns or cultural</v>
<v Speaker 5>personhood,</v>

1967
01:27:44.570 --> 01:27:45.750
<v Speaker 5>who you are as a human being.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1968
01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:46.593
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1969
01:27:46.910 --> 01:27:49.390
<v Speaker 5>there are some guys who,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1970
01:27:49.580 --> 01:27:52.610
<v Speaker 5>don't have any ideological reasons for</v>
<v Speaker 5>hating evolution psychology,</v>

1971
01:27:52.611 --> 01:27:54.650
<v Speaker 5>but because they don't know much about</v>
<v Speaker 5>evolution psychology,</v>

1972
01:27:54.651 --> 01:27:56.240
<v Speaker 5>they typically will argue,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1973
01:27:56.241 --> 01:27:59.300
<v Speaker 5>evolution has come up with all these</v>
<v Speaker 5>fanciful post hoc stories.</v>

1974
01:27:59.540 --> 01:28:01.460
<v Speaker 5>And in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the article that I wrote that I</v>

1975
01:28:01.461 --> 01:28:04.790
<v Speaker 5>discussed on your show today seeks to</v>
<v Speaker 5>address that.</v>

1976
01:28:05.050 --> 01:28:07.790
<v Speaker 5>Then contrary to what people think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1977
01:28:07.910 --> 01:28:11.660
<v Speaker 5>the standard of evidence that</v>
<v Speaker 5>evolutionary scientists typically seek</v>

1978
01:28:11.661 --> 01:28:16.661
<v Speaker 5>to meet prior to accepting an</v>
<v Speaker 5>explanation is actually much,</v>

1979
01:28:17.031 --> 01:28:21.860
<v Speaker 5>much higher than other sciences by the</v>
<v Speaker 5>very nature of the epistemology of the</v>

1980
01:28:21.861 --> 01:28:24.080
<v Speaker 5>field,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by the very nature of how knowledge is</v>

1981
01:28:24.081 --> 01:28:25.820
<v Speaker 5>created and generated an evolutionary</v>
<v Speaker 5>theory.</v>

1982
01:28:25.821 --> 01:28:28.490
<v Speaker 5>So for all sorts of reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 5>reasons,</v>

1983
01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:33.520
<v Speaker 5>none of which is valid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a long queue of frankly buffoons</v>

1984
01:28:34.310 --> 01:28:38.780
<v Speaker 5>who despise evolutionary theory.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now the reality is that they're going to</v>

1985
01:28:38.781 --> 01:28:39.800
<v Speaker 5>lose this battle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1986
01:28:40.550 --> 01:28:45.550
<v Speaker 5>There will be a day when it will become</v>
<v Speaker 5>by now to argue that humans are driven</v>

1987
01:28:46.101 --> 01:28:49.250
<v Speaker 5>by evolutionary imperatives.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I already see it from my own</v>

1988
01:28:49.251 --> 01:28:52.580
<v Speaker 5>scientific career.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If I look at the antipathy that I felt</v>

1989
01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:56.630
<v Speaker 5>that I faced 15 years ago versus today,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's very,</v>

1990
01:28:56.631 --> 01:28:57.260
<v Speaker 5>very different.</v>

1991
01:28:57.260 --> 01:28:59.630
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The antipathy that I felt from sometimes</v>

1992
01:28:59.631 --> 01:29:03.120
<v Speaker 5>the same person,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I could still have emails from somebody</v>

1993
01:29:03.121 --> 01:29:06.750
<v Speaker 5>who wrote me 10 years ago thinking that</v>
<v Speaker 5>my work was full of Shit,</v>

1994
01:29:07.050 --> 01:29:09.930
<v Speaker 5>who's now inviting me to his university</v>
<v Speaker 5>with all sorts of deference.</v>

1995
01:29:10.170 --> 01:29:11.760
<v Speaker 5>And so that's the nature of science,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1996
01:29:11.761 --> 01:29:14.940
<v Speaker 5>It's auto corrective.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the reality is the cat's out of the</v>

1997
01:29:14.941 --> 01:29:15.930
<v Speaker 5>bag.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We,</v>

1998
01:29:16.070 --> 01:29:17.580
<v Speaker 5>everything's evolutionary,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1999
01:29:17.581 --> 01:29:17.911
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>

2000
01:29:17.911 --> 01:29:20.880
<v Speaker 5>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we could talk about the range of fields</v>

2001
01:29:21.030 --> 01:29:24.360
<v Speaker 5>where evolution has made its way in</v>
<v Speaker 5>fields where you wouldn't typically</v>

2002
01:29:24.361 --> 01:29:25.810
<v Speaker 5>think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So is that something that interests you</v>

2003
01:29:25.820 --> 01:29:28.100
<v Speaker 5>that we can talk about that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I want to keep going down this road</v>

2004
01:29:28.110 --> 01:29:28.943
<v Speaker 5>for a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

2005
01:29:29.460 --> 01:29:33.510
<v Speaker 5>I find it very fascinating when people</v>
<v Speaker 5>oppose things that seem pretty obvious,</v>

2006
01:29:33.540 --> 01:29:35.460
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And not only that,</v>

2007
01:29:35.490 --> 01:29:40.260
<v Speaker 5>or unwilling to take into account that</v>
<v Speaker 5>it might not be a case of either or,</v>

2008
01:29:40.530 --> 01:29:42.100
<v Speaker 5>but it might be a case of there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2009
01:29:42.510 --> 01:29:47.510
<v Speaker 5>a bunch of combining factors and that</v>
<v Speaker 5>evolution must certainly continue to</v>

2010
01:29:48.451 --> 01:29:48.750
<v Speaker 5>play.</v>

2011
01:29:48.750 --> 01:29:51.960
<v Speaker 5>It's the idea that we've completely</v>
<v Speaker 5>transcended evolution with culture and</v>

2012
01:29:51.961 --> 01:29:54.000
<v Speaker 5>thinking and logic and language.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's insane.</v>

2013
01:29:54.210 --> 01:29:56.310
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

2014
01:29:56.370 --> 01:29:58.770
<v Speaker 5>forgive me if I've mentioned this on the</v>
<v Speaker 5>show before,</v>

2015
01:29:58.771 --> 01:29:59.370
<v Speaker 5>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

2016
01:29:59.370 --> 01:30:01.350
<v Speaker 5>if I have it's worth repeating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2017
01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:04.680
<v Speaker 5>I always talk about the interaction test</v>
<v Speaker 5>framework.</v>

2018
01:30:04.710 --> 01:30:07.320
<v Speaker 5>Interaction basically means everything's</v>
<v Speaker 5>interaction.</v>

2019
01:30:07.321 --> 01:30:09.810
<v Speaker 5>Most things aren't traction between our</v>
<v Speaker 5>genes and our environment.</v>

2020
01:30:09.811 --> 01:30:10.260
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2021
01:30:10.260 --> 01:30:13.440
<v Speaker 5>As a matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 5>genes get turned on or off as a function</v>

2022
01:30:13.441 --> 01:30:15.960
<v Speaker 5>of environmental input,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is fascinating.</v>

2023
01:30:15.990 --> 01:30:18.540
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Evolution happens within an environment.</v>

2024
01:30:18.780 --> 01:30:23.640
<v Speaker 5>So by its very nature,</v>
<v Speaker 5>evolution itself recognizes the</v>

2025
01:30:23.641 --> 01:30:25.200
<v Speaker 5>importance of the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2026
01:30:25.380 --> 01:30:26.310
<v Speaker 5>So any,</v>
<v Speaker 5>any,</v>

2027
01:30:26.400 --> 01:30:27.960
<v Speaker 5>anybody who is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2028
01:30:28.220 --> 01:30:33.120
<v Speaker 5>who exhibits hatred or rejection of</v>
<v Speaker 5>biology using those types of arguments,</v>

2029
01:30:33.140 --> 01:30:36.450
<v Speaker 5>it's simply advertising and they know</v>
<v Speaker 5>very little about biology.</v>

2030
01:30:36.780 --> 01:30:40.410
<v Speaker 5>The reality is it's an interaction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the example I like to give,</v>

2031
01:30:40.411 --> 01:30:42.540
<v Speaker 5>the metaphor I give is the cake</v>
<v Speaker 5>metaphor.</v>

2032
01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.630
<v Speaker 5>If you take the separate ingredients of</v>
<v Speaker 5>a cake,</v>

2033
01:30:45.660 --> 01:30:48.590
<v Speaker 5>here's the sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's the exit as the baking soda,</v>

2034
01:30:48.600 --> 01:30:49.620
<v Speaker 5>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever the parts are,</v>

2035
01:30:49.621 --> 01:30:51.840
<v Speaker 5>the butter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're separate at first.</v>

2036
01:30:51.930 --> 01:30:55.110
<v Speaker 5>Now you bake the cake.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If I then ask you when you have the</v>

2037
01:30:55.111 --> 01:30:59.010
<v Speaker 5>final kick in front of you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>point to the sugar or point to the eggs,</v>

2038
01:30:59.011 --> 01:31:01.170
<v Speaker 5>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's an inextricable mix.</v>

2039
01:31:01.171 --> 01:31:02.370
<v Speaker 5>Them both.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's a very good point.</v>

2040
01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:05.730
<v Speaker 5>That's what we are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We are in an inextricable mix of our</v>

2041
01:31:05.731 --> 01:31:09.600
<v Speaker 5>genes and our unique environments and</v>
<v Speaker 5>our unique talents and our unique</v>

2042
01:31:09.620 --> 01:31:12.930
<v Speaker 5>personhoods.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The problem with much of the social</v>

2043
01:31:12.931 --> 01:31:16.230
<v Speaker 5>sciences has been,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they're losing now by the day,</v>

2044
01:31:16.500 --> 01:31:21.500
<v Speaker 5>has been that they've completely</v>
<v Speaker 5>rejected biology as an any way relevant</v>

2045
01:31:22.381 --> 01:31:25.710
<v Speaker 5>and explaining anything,</v>
<v Speaker 5>mating criminality,</v>

2046
01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:27.630
<v Speaker 5>a political choice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For example,</v>

2047
01:31:27.631 --> 01:31:30.840
<v Speaker 5>there's a field called evolutionary</v>
<v Speaker 5>politics or bio politics,</v>

2048
01:31:31.050 --> 01:31:35.400
<v Speaker 5>which tries to infuse evolutionary</v>
<v Speaker 5>theory within political science.</v>

2049
01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:36.720
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no kidding.</v>

2050
01:31:36.750 --> 01:31:39.060
<v Speaker 5>I mean what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What happens when we were making</v>

2051
01:31:39.061 --> 01:31:40.860
<v Speaker 5>political choices?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Suddenly our biology,</v>

2052
01:31:40.861 --> 01:31:44.490
<v Speaker 5>she's just a matter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So evolutionary theory is relevant</v>

2053
01:31:44.760 --> 01:31:48.450
<v Speaker 5>anywhere that you're studying biological</v>
<v Speaker 5>agents.</v>

2054
01:31:48.870 --> 01:31:52.500
<v Speaker 5>So what is the argument against this and</v>
<v Speaker 5>what and why?</v>

2055
01:31:52.530 --> 01:31:57.300
<v Speaker 5>How has someone got into a university</v>
<v Speaker 5>level teaching this kind of bullshit?</v>

2056
01:31:57.810 --> 01:31:59.950
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it comes from several sources.</v>

2057
01:32:00.010 --> 01:32:02.350
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so maybe we could sort of point to a few</v>

2058
01:32:02.351 --> 01:32:04.540
<v Speaker 5>of you ever debated anyone about this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2059
01:32:04.541 --> 01:32:08.590
<v Speaker 5>and I mean I have in various forms,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not necessarily in a public one on one</v>

2060
01:32:08.591 --> 01:32:10.060
<v Speaker 5>like this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I would like to see that,</v>

2061
01:32:10.450 --> 01:32:11.410
<v Speaker 5>hook it up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>make it happen.</v>

2062
01:32:11.920 --> 01:32:13.360
<v Speaker 5>I would like to find somebody who</v>
<v Speaker 5>opposes,</v>

2063
01:32:13.361 --> 01:32:16.930
<v Speaker 5>you have read their stuff online and</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's infuriating.</v>

2064
01:32:17.050 --> 01:32:19.090
<v Speaker 5>It's unopposed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like someone who writes a ridiculous</v>

2065
01:32:19.091 --> 01:32:21.040
<v Speaker 5>blog and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

2066
01:32:21.041 --> 01:32:23.530
<v Speaker 5>you know right away what the motivation</v>
<v Speaker 5>is.</v>

2067
01:32:23.550 --> 01:32:28.550
<v Speaker 5>Someone who is distorting reality to fit</v>
<v Speaker 5>their own ridiculous view of the world.</v>

2068
01:32:29.620 --> 01:32:31.510
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've debated them and typically one of</v>

2069
01:32:31.511 --> 01:32:35.620
<v Speaker 5>two ways,</v>
<v Speaker 5>either through the review process where</v>

2070
01:32:35.621 --> 01:32:38.470
<v Speaker 5>usually they're anonymous and oftentimes</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm in on this.</v>

2071
01:32:38.680 --> 01:32:41.080
<v Speaker 5>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a double blind review process,</v>

2072
01:32:41.320 --> 01:32:43.270
<v Speaker 5>I don't know who they are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't know who I am,</v>

2073
01:32:43.480 --> 01:32:45.150
<v Speaker 5>and then we're engaging in the debate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2074
01:32:45.310 --> 01:32:48.280
<v Speaker 5>And oftentimes the paper gets rejected</v>
<v Speaker 5>because they're the reviewer,</v>

2075
01:32:48.281 --> 01:32:50.110
<v Speaker 5>they're the editor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then they have the final say.</v>

2076
01:32:50.350 --> 01:32:53.260
<v Speaker 5>So in that context of the Beta,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or I've debated publicly,</v>

2077
01:32:53.261 --> 01:32:56.200
<v Speaker 5>typically when I go after somebody on</v>
<v Speaker 5>twitter who is espousing these kinds of</v>

2078
01:32:56.201 --> 01:32:58.150
<v Speaker 5>stupidities,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I've never done it publicly in this</v>

2079
01:32:58.151 --> 01:32:59.770
<v Speaker 5>way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you had a paper,</v>

2080
01:32:59.800 --> 01:33:03.730
<v Speaker 5>a rejected that was logical and</v>
<v Speaker 5>objective and made a lot of sense?</v>

2081
01:33:03.790 --> 01:33:06.280
<v Speaker 5>Tons of times really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And what like give me an example one.</v>

2082
01:33:06.820 --> 01:33:08.550
<v Speaker 5>So the paper when I was talking to you</v>
<v Speaker 5>about the,</v>

2083
01:33:08.760 --> 01:33:11.630
<v Speaker 5>the tree of knowledge going down the</v>
<v Speaker 5>tree sexual selection plan.</v>

2084
01:33:11.670 --> 01:33:15.520
<v Speaker 5>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I had a paper where I had looked at</v>

2085
01:33:15.970 --> 01:33:20.410
<v Speaker 5>how much information do men and women</v>
<v Speaker 5>look at before they either reject a mate</v>

2086
01:33:20.470 --> 01:33:22.170
<v Speaker 5>or choose a mate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which I mentioned earlier,</v>

2087
01:33:22.171 --> 01:33:24.370
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That paper originally I had sent it to a</v>

2088
01:33:24.371 --> 01:33:29.371
<v Speaker 5>top journal and consumer psychology and</v>
<v Speaker 5>to kind of just summarize the,</v>

2089
01:33:30.181 --> 01:33:30.851
<v Speaker 5>the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2090
01:33:30.851 --> 01:33:31.750
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the position,</v>

2091
01:33:32.050 --> 01:33:33.640
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well this is all biology.</v>

2092
01:33:33.641 --> 01:33:35.320
<v Speaker 5>What does this have to do with</v>
<v Speaker 5>psychology?</v>

2093
01:33:35.830 --> 01:33:40.830
<v Speaker 5>So these very esteemed psychologist</v>
<v Speaker 5>somehow thought that biology existed in</v>

2094
01:33:44.111 --> 01:33:47.410
<v Speaker 5>a separate realm to psychology in a</v>
<v Speaker 5>vacuum.</v>

2095
01:33:47.560 --> 01:33:50.050
<v Speaker 5>You're brain exists in this other</v>
<v Speaker 5>parallel.</v>

2096
01:33:50.051 --> 01:33:52.900
<v Speaker 5>His influence,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the body has no influence in the brain</v>

2097
01:33:52.901 --> 01:33:53.734
<v Speaker 5>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

2098
01:33:53.770 --> 01:33:55.180
<v Speaker 5>The other thing that they were upset</v>
<v Speaker 5>about,</v>

2099
01:33:55.560 --> 01:33:58.060
<v Speaker 5>cause they were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well why is this person who was an</v>

2100
01:33:58.061 --> 01:34:02.530
<v Speaker 5>otherwise be very patronizing was an</v>
<v Speaker 5>otherwise clearly a bright behavioral</v>

2101
01:34:02.531 --> 01:34:07.210
<v Speaker 5>scientists talking about sex differences</v>
<v Speaker 5>when we should be looking at things that</v>

2102
01:34:07.211 --> 01:34:09.220
<v Speaker 5>make us similar to one another.</v>

2103
01:34:09.430 --> 01:34:10.990
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you're talking about sex</v>

2104
01:34:10.991 --> 01:34:14.230
<v Speaker 5>differences in mating behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your study sex differences,</v>

2105
01:34:14.530 --> 01:34:17.770
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's a fundamental defining</v>

2106
01:34:17.860 --> 01:34:20.920
<v Speaker 5>quality of humans that they are sexually</v>
<v Speaker 5>dimorphic.</v>

2107
01:34:20.921 --> 01:34:23.080
<v Speaker 5>They are innate differences between men</v>
<v Speaker 5>and women.</v>

2108
01:34:23.380 --> 01:34:26.590
<v Speaker 5>So he are people who did not want to</v>
<v Speaker 5>accept that they were sex differences</v>

2109
01:34:26.620 --> 01:34:29.170
<v Speaker 5>between men and women.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they didn't want to accept that</v>

2110
01:34:29.530 --> 01:34:33.010
<v Speaker 5>biology has something important to say</v>
<v Speaker 5>about psychology.</v>

2111
01:34:33.070 --> 01:34:35.680
<v Speaker 5>Right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If I speak to neuroscientists,</v>

2112
01:34:35.710 --> 01:34:39.790
<v Speaker 5>if I speak to bio psychologists,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they would listen to my stuff and say,</v>

2113
01:34:39.850 --> 01:34:40.690
<v Speaker 5>well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no kidding.</v>

2114
01:34:41.150 --> 01:34:44.080
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so in a sense I've existed in a</v>

2115
01:34:44.081 --> 01:34:49.081
<v Speaker 5>fractured life in my academic life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If I am navigating amongst my natural</v>

2116
01:34:49.721 --> 01:34:52.000
<v Speaker 5>science colleagues,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then they're all like,</v>

2117
01:34:52.180 --> 01:34:53.710
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love your stuff.</v>

2118
01:34:53.740 --> 01:34:54.670
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love you.</v>

2119
01:34:55.090 --> 01:34:57.650
<v Speaker 5>If I navigate amongst my social science</v>
<v Speaker 5>friends,</v>

2120
01:34:57.651 --> 01:34:58.040
<v Speaker 5>while they're</v>

2121
01:34:58.040 --> 01:35:01.010
<v Speaker 1>less loving and less receptive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're coming around.</v>

2122
01:35:01.340 --> 01:35:04.730
<v Speaker 1>So I think the problem stems from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>empty slate premise,</v>

2123
01:35:05.030 --> 01:35:09.950
<v Speaker 1>the idea that we are born with empty</v>
<v Speaker 1>minds that are only subsequently failed</v>

2124
01:35:10.280 --> 01:35:13.670
<v Speaker 1>by a wide range by a cascading number</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

2125
01:35:13.830 --> 01:35:16.520
<v Speaker 1>that's a nonsensical isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

2126
01:35:16.521 --> 01:35:18.620
<v Speaker 1>But it also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a problem with someone saying,</v>

2127
01:35:18.621 --> 01:35:22.130
<v Speaker 1>why are you looking at this instead of</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at that?</v>

2128
01:35:22.180 --> 01:35:23.570
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well looking at this,</v>

2129
01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:24.980
<v Speaker 1>it just because you're looking at</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

2130
01:35:24.981 --> 01:35:29.981
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't make it so that you can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand why we were all similar in</v>

2131
01:35:30.231 --> 01:35:35.231
<v Speaker 1>many ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the denial of these preferences of</v>

2132
01:35:35.331 --> 01:35:38.270
<v Speaker 1>these genetic preferences of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary tendencies,</v>

2133
01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:42.020
<v Speaker 1>that's not scientific at all like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>

2134
01:35:42.110 --> 01:35:45.110
<v Speaker 1>that's really preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that that's being taught to</v>

2135
01:35:45.111 --> 01:35:49.670
<v Speaker 1>kids and that they go leave these</v>
<v Speaker 1>institutions with these thoughts in</v>

2136
01:35:49.671 --> 01:35:52.700
<v Speaker 1>their head that are based on a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that have never even existed in</v>

2137
01:35:52.701 --> 01:35:53.540
<v Speaker 1>the outside world.</v>

2138
01:35:53.750 --> 01:35:57.110
<v Speaker 1>That's what's fucked up about schools</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of ways chair is there going</v>

2139
01:35:57.111 --> 01:36:01.580
<v Speaker 1>from learning by these people to</v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming one of these people teaching in</v>

2140
01:36:01.581 --> 01:36:03.980
<v Speaker 1>these schools and never existing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2141
01:36:03.981 --> 01:36:08.420
<v Speaker 1>John gigantic percentage never existing</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of academia.</v>

2142
01:36:08.510 --> 01:36:10.390
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to speak,</v>

2143
01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:13.460
<v Speaker 1>to your point about if I ever faced this</v>
<v Speaker 1>type of antipathy and so on,</v>

2144
01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:17.510
<v Speaker 1>I gave two talks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of my first book came out at a</v>

2145
01:36:17.511 --> 01:36:21.140
<v Speaker 1>university in the psychology department</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in the business school they were</v>

2146
01:36:21.141 --> 01:36:24.890
<v Speaker 1>back to back to on two separate days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this was a talk on my book.</v>

2147
01:36:24.891 --> 01:36:27.380
<v Speaker 1>How do you Darwin eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the field of consumer behavior.</v>

2148
01:36:28.220 --> 01:36:30.170
<v Speaker 1>I gave it in the psychology department</v>
<v Speaker 1>first,</v>

2149
01:36:30.650 --> 01:36:33.760
<v Speaker 1>which is made up of a lot of people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>have background in neurosciences,</v>

2150
01:36:33.770 --> 01:36:35.720
<v Speaker 1>in biology and they all listened and</v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

2151
01:36:35.721 --> 01:36:36.740
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful.</v>

2152
01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:37.491
<v Speaker 1>No kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2153
01:36:37.491 --> 01:36:39.530
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to study our consumer Tory nature,</v>

2154
01:36:39.740 --> 01:36:42.590
<v Speaker 1>we have to understand the biological</v>
<v Speaker 1>impulses that drive us.</v>

2155
01:36:42.710 --> 01:36:46.070
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exact same talk the next day in the</v>

2156
01:36:46.071 --> 01:36:48.200
<v Speaker 1>business school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is one of the top universities in</v>

2157
01:36:48.201 --> 01:36:50.360
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't get through a single</v>

2158
01:36:50.361 --> 01:36:51.920
<v Speaker 1>sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

2159
01:36:52.310 --> 01:36:55.640
<v Speaker 1>Because of the amount of hostility that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I faced in the business school,</v>

2160
01:36:55.641 --> 01:36:56.840
<v Speaker 1>the business school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why Business?</v>

2161
01:36:57.170 --> 01:36:59.330
<v Speaker 1>So I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a very interesting question.</v>

2162
01:36:59.331 --> 01:37:01.940
<v Speaker 1>So I think business practitioners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in other words,</v>

2163
01:37:02.060 --> 01:37:05.420
<v Speaker 1>business people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not business academics actually loved by</v>

2164
01:37:05.421 --> 01:37:09.800
<v Speaker 1>work or historically he loved my work</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're not vested in a</v>

2165
01:37:09.801 --> 01:37:11.990
<v Speaker 1>particular paradigm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All they care ideology,</v>

2166
01:37:12.110 --> 01:37:15.380
<v Speaker 1>they care about results.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What works right or earns the money.</v>

2167
01:37:15.410 --> 01:37:17.840
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to tell me what are the</v>

2168
01:37:17.841 --> 01:37:22.841
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary triggers for me to develop</v>
<v Speaker 1>a more effective advertising campaign.</v>

2169
01:37:23.570 --> 01:37:25.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in talk to me professor side.</v>

2170
01:37:25.601 --> 01:37:28.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a shit about your</v>
<v Speaker 1>paradigmatic fights in academia,</v>

2171
01:37:28.790 --> 01:37:30.710
<v Speaker 1>but yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the act,</v>

2172
01:37:30.740 --> 01:37:35.740
<v Speaker 1>but the academics who've been vested in</v>
<v Speaker 1>social constructivism or an cultural</v>

2173
01:37:36.261 --> 01:37:38.570
<v Speaker 1>relativism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every culture is relative.</v>

2174
01:37:38.571 --> 01:37:42.380
<v Speaker 1>There are no human universals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no shared human nature.</v>

2175
01:37:42.381 --> 01:37:47.381
<v Speaker 1>There is no shared biological heritage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I come in on my biology train and</v>

2176
01:37:47.990 --> 01:37:50.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got to shut this guy down.</v>

2177
01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:53.780
<v Speaker 1>Now the reality is if you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>sufficiently confident about what you're</v>

2178
01:37:53.781 --> 01:37:55.590
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you ride out that storm.</v>

2179
01:37:55.620 --> 01:37:56.340
<v Speaker 1>And Luckily</v>

2180
01:37:56.340 --> 01:37:57.390
<v Speaker 5>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2181
01:37:57.450 --> 01:38:00.060
<v Speaker 5>now 20 years into the game,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2182
01:38:00.090 --> 01:38:03.000
<v Speaker 5>more people are coming to seeing things</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the way that I'm saying him.</v>

2183
01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:08.360
<v Speaker 5>But it's taken a lot of dog fighting to</v>
<v Speaker 5>convince people,</v>

2184
01:38:08.600 --> 01:38:09.750
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>

2185
01:38:09.751 --> 01:38:12.810
<v Speaker 5>of the veracity of what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So when you were giving these speeches</v>

2186
01:38:13.030 --> 01:38:14.340
<v Speaker 5>and you're being interrupted,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

2187
01:38:14.460 --> 01:38:15.960
<v Speaker 5>Like what are they saying?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No example.</v>

2188
01:38:16.010 --> 01:38:17.100
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll get the first one.</v>

2189
01:38:18.300 --> 01:38:21.180
<v Speaker 5>How do you explain homosexuality?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2190
01:38:21.181 --> 01:38:24.240
<v Speaker 5>Because their first instinct,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no pun intended,</v>

2191
01:38:24.241 --> 01:38:27.270
<v Speaker 5>instincts as an evolutionary</v>
<v Speaker 5>term,</v>

2192
01:38:27.720 --> 01:38:28.610
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

2193
01:38:28.630 --> 01:38:31.470
<v Speaker 5>they want to show that if everything is</v>
<v Speaker 5>evolutionary,</v>

2194
01:38:31.500 --> 01:38:33.720
<v Speaker 5>if everything is adaptive,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then how could you explain something</v>

2195
01:38:33.721 --> 01:38:36.780
<v Speaker 5>like homosexuality,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which by definition is Darwinian,</v>

2196
01:38:37.050 --> 01:38:38.340
<v Speaker 5>could the socket that end?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2197
01:38:39.090 --> 01:38:39.751
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then I say,</v>

2198
01:38:39.751 --> 01:38:41.790
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there are some evolutionary theories</v>

2199
01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:44.460
<v Speaker 5>that try to explain homosexuality,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's not really the focus of my</v>

2200
01:38:44.461 --> 01:38:45.630
<v Speaker 5>talk tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can I just go on?</v>

2201
01:38:46.150 --> 01:38:49.080
<v Speaker 5>And he explained suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here's the other.</v>

2202
01:38:49.140 --> 01:38:51.880
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if we are these adaptive creatures that,</v>

2203
01:38:52.060 --> 01:38:55.260
<v Speaker 5>that have this survival instinct,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how do you explain the fact that there</v>

2204
01:38:55.261 --> 01:38:57.420
<v Speaker 5>is an epidemiology of suicide?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why would somebody to take their own</v>

2205
01:38:57.421 --> 01:38:58.260
<v Speaker 5>life?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2206
01:38:58.470 --> 01:38:59.690
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if I started,</v>

2207
01:38:59.700 --> 01:39:03.600
<v Speaker 5>it's pretty easy to describe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think I'd have a problem with</v>

2208
01:39:03.750 --> 01:39:06.810
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then imagine if this goes on for</v>

2209
01:39:06.811 --> 01:39:08.310
<v Speaker 5>every syllable that I authored,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2210
01:39:08.340 --> 01:39:10.850
<v Speaker 5>So these are students that are</v>
<v Speaker 5>interrupting all these up,</v>

2211
01:39:10.851 --> 01:39:12.960
<v Speaker 5>but he's a professor professors,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as a matter of fact.</v>

2212
01:39:13.010 --> 01:39:14.550
<v Speaker 5>That's so rude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2213
01:39:14.970 --> 01:39:19.260
<v Speaker 5>So two points I'll make the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the more senior,</v>

2214
01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:23.520
<v Speaker 5>the person in the room,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the more hostile they were really.</v>

2215
01:39:24.420 --> 01:39:27.720
<v Speaker 5>So the doctoral students who took me out</v>
<v Speaker 5>to lunch after,</v>

2216
01:39:28.380 --> 01:39:29.640
<v Speaker 5>we're all like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh man,</v>

2217
01:39:29.670 --> 01:39:30.880
<v Speaker 5>I love your stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Professors up.</v>

2218
01:39:30.930 --> 01:39:31.830
<v Speaker 5>Now why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Again,</v>

2219
01:39:32.070 --> 01:39:36.630
<v Speaker 5>anecdotally we can understand why</v>
<v Speaker 5>because the more senior professors are</v>

2220
01:39:36.631 --> 01:39:41.631
<v Speaker 5>vested in their paradigms,</v>
<v Speaker 5>therefore their brains are closed to any</v>

2221
01:39:41.701 --> 01:39:43.890
<v Speaker 5>ideas that might challenge the status</v>
<v Speaker 5>quo.</v>

2222
01:39:44.100 --> 01:39:49.020
<v Speaker 5>The doctoral student who still surfing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who's surfing at the buffet of ideas is</v>

2223
01:39:49.021 --> 01:39:50.160
<v Speaker 5>open to the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

2224
01:39:50.161 --> 01:39:53.250
<v Speaker 5>Biology seems to make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The second thing that I'll point when</v>

2225
01:39:53.251 --> 01:39:56.760
<v Speaker 5>you said it's very rude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I actually got upset and I'll just try</v>

2226
01:39:56.761 --> 01:40:00.120
<v Speaker 5>to stay with the Corum and politeness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but as we were leaving,</v>

2227
01:40:00.121 --> 01:40:02.040
<v Speaker 5>I took a couple of those senior folks</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I said,</v>

2228
01:40:02.370 --> 01:40:04.740
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is the point of inviting me here</v>

2229
01:40:05.250 --> 01:40:09.900
<v Speaker 5>and wasting your money and our</v>
<v Speaker 5>respective time by not giving me a</v>

2230
01:40:09.901 --> 01:40:12.660
<v Speaker 5>chance to get through my talk?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Would it make more sense to give me the</v>

2231
01:40:12.661 --> 01:40:14.310
<v Speaker 5>forum?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then at the end of the day,</v>

2232
01:40:14.311 --> 01:40:17.520
<v Speaker 5>if you decide that it's not worthwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you throw it in the garbage,</v>

2233
01:40:17.521 --> 01:40:20.580
<v Speaker 5>but at least you've given,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've given me the opportunity to share</v>

2234
01:40:20.581 --> 01:40:21.830
<v Speaker 5>my ideas with you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh No,</v>

2235
01:40:21.831 --> 01:40:25.230
<v Speaker 5>no professor side you mis mistook are</v>
<v Speaker 5>interruptions is because we were so</v>

2236
01:40:25.231 --> 01:40:26.040
<v Speaker 5>engaged.</v>

2237
01:40:26.040 --> 01:40:26.371
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2238
01:40:26.371 --> 01:40:29.220
<v Speaker 5>it can't be really engaged when you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>not allowing me to finish the syllable.</v>

2239
01:40:29.310 --> 01:40:30.001
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not only that,</v>

2240
01:40:30.001 --> 01:40:33.360
<v Speaker 5>it's really simple to take notes and</v>
<v Speaker 5>then at the end of it ask me questions.</v>

2241
01:40:33.370 --> 01:40:33.991
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2242
01:40:33.991 --> 01:40:37.290
<v Speaker 5>why did they feel like they have the</v>
<v Speaker 5>right to interrupt your speech?</v>

2243
01:40:37.320 --> 01:40:41.280
<v Speaker 5>That's a great question.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I usually ask people to hold off their</v>

2244
01:40:41.281 --> 01:40:45.720
<v Speaker 5>questions till the q and a period,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't know why,</v>

2245
01:40:45.721 --> 01:40:49.230
<v Speaker 5>but especially in business schools and</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's certainly in some of the top</v>

2246
01:40:49.231 --> 01:40:53.080
<v Speaker 5>business schools,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's this culture of very sort of</v>

2247
01:40:53.500 --> 01:40:57.510
<v Speaker 5>Alpha maleness where you hammer at the</v>
<v Speaker 5>person you,</v>

2248
01:40:57.730 --> 01:41:00.020
<v Speaker 5>you because you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're trying to one up them up and it's</v>

2249
01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:02.440
<v Speaker 5>very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a great story on Richard.</v>

2250
01:41:02.800 --> 01:41:04.270
<v Speaker 5>Do you know who Richard Feinman is?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

2251
01:41:04.630 --> 01:41:06.760
<v Speaker 5>The Great Nobel Prize winning</v>
<v Speaker 5>physicists.</v>

2252
01:41:06.761 --> 01:41:08.320
<v Speaker 5>I think I read it in his book.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2253
01:41:08.470 --> 01:41:09.550
<v Speaker 5>surely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You must be joking,</v>

2254
01:41:09.551 --> 01:41:10.384
<v Speaker 5>Mister Feynman.</v>

2255
01:41:10.770 --> 01:41:12.940
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I hope I don't watch the story,</v>

2256
01:41:12.941 --> 01:41:17.470
<v Speaker 5>but the story goes something like this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's giving his sort of pre final</v>

2257
01:41:17.471 --> 01:41:19.720
<v Speaker 5>dissertation talk is sort of</v>
<v Speaker 5>departmental talk.</v>

2258
01:41:19.750 --> 01:41:24.750
<v Speaker 5>He's still a doctoral student at</v>
<v Speaker 5>Princeton and fun of the WHO's who of</v>

2259
01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:26.860
<v Speaker 5>leading physicists throughout.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2260
01:41:27.100 --> 01:41:31.270
<v Speaker 5>Einstein is there and everybody's there</v>
<v Speaker 5>and as he's giving his talk as a young</v>

2261
01:41:31.271 --> 01:41:34.030
<v Speaker 5>doctoral student,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there is this one professor who's</v>

2262
01:41:34.060 --> 01:41:37.540
<v Speaker 5>interrupting him and the way that those</v>
<v Speaker 5>folks were interrupting me at that</v>

2263
01:41:37.541 --> 01:41:42.250
<v Speaker 5>school and from the corner somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 5>apparently Albert Einstein says,</v>

2264
01:41:42.490 --> 01:41:46.540
<v Speaker 5>don't you think we owe the young men the</v>
<v Speaker 5>respect to let him finish speaking?</v>

2265
01:41:46.541 --> 01:41:49.840
<v Speaker 5>And then I'm sure at the end of his talk</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'll have plenty of opportunities to</v>

2266
01:41:49.870 --> 01:41:51.760
<v Speaker 5>answer us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then after that nobody said</v>

2267
01:41:51.761 --> 01:41:54.190
<v Speaker 5>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I think it's part of that baboons</v>

2268
01:41:54.191 --> 01:41:56.380
<v Speaker 5>sort of gorilla thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to show you that I'm the</v>

2269
01:41:56.381 --> 01:41:57.340
<v Speaker 5>smartest guy in the room.</v>

2270
01:41:57.580 --> 01:42:00.250
<v Speaker 5>So you're typically see it from not the</v>
<v Speaker 5>truly elite,</v>

2271
01:42:00.640 --> 01:42:05.640
<v Speaker 5>the truly elite don't have to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the guys just below want to show</v>

2272
01:42:06.131 --> 01:42:09.820
<v Speaker 5>that they're the toughest guys in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>prison yard and therefore they interrupt</v>

2273
01:42:09.821 --> 01:42:10.571
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they harass you,</v>

2274
01:42:10.571 --> 01:42:11.261
<v Speaker 5>they heckle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2275
01:42:11.261 --> 01:42:13.990
<v Speaker 5>it's so on the same type of people that</v>
<v Speaker 5>would go after you with like a hate</v>

2276
01:42:13.991 --> 01:42:15.400
<v Speaker 5>blog.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

2277
01:42:15.430 --> 01:42:19.150
<v Speaker 5>Professors that are just fringe</v>
<v Speaker 5>intellectuals that just really aren't</v>

2278
01:42:19.151 --> 01:42:22.930
<v Speaker 5>that really that smart,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they've achieved this notoriety.</v>

2279
01:42:22.931 --> 01:42:26.830
<v Speaker 5>And a a status because of the fact</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're teaching at some school.</v>

2280
01:42:26.860 --> 01:42:28.300
<v Speaker 5>Can I mention one such got,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sure.</v>

2281
01:42:29.590 --> 01:42:31.630
<v Speaker 5>A grand buffoon,</v>
<v Speaker 5>peas,</v>

2282
01:42:31.631 --> 01:42:33.620
<v Speaker 5>Ed Meyers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you know that?</v>

2283
01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:37.090
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know that is one of the most execrable</v>

2284
01:42:37.150 --> 01:42:41.500
<v Speaker 5>creatures that has ever walked academia.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know him personally well,</v>

2285
01:42:41.860 --> 01:42:46.860
<v Speaker 5>but he's the exact type of guy who</v>
<v Speaker 5>exhibits those types of behaviors.</v>

2286
01:42:47.260 --> 01:42:52.260
<v Speaker 5>He has an incredibly successful science</v>
<v Speaker 5>blog hat off hat tip to him for having</v>

2287
01:42:53.561 --> 01:42:58.561
<v Speaker 5>that forum,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but all he does all day is attack fellow</v>

2288
01:42:58.870 --> 01:43:03.070
<v Speaker 5>scientists an extra ordinarily,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2289
01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:04.960
<v Speaker 5>poisonous manners.</v>

2290
01:43:04.990 --> 01:43:08.200
<v Speaker 5>It's never respectful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Certainly evolutionary psychologists,</v>

2291
01:43:08.201 --> 01:43:12.760
<v Speaker 5>we're all lobotomized idiots who are</v>
<v Speaker 5>faking science.</v>

2292
01:43:12.761 --> 01:43:16.510
<v Speaker 5>He's the real scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All of us are just idiots who couldn't,</v>

2293
01:43:16.511 --> 01:43:18.100
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are borderline illiterates.</v>

2294
01:43:18.490 --> 01:43:22.810
<v Speaker 5>And the reality is the last time that he</v>
<v Speaker 5>ever published something was probably</v>

2295
01:43:22.811 --> 01:43:27.460
<v Speaker 5>around the period of the renaissance and</v>
<v Speaker 5>yet he feels perfectly comfortable</v>

2296
01:43:27.461 --> 01:43:30.700
<v Speaker 5>criticizing folks who are infinitely</v>
<v Speaker 5>more productive than him.</v>

2297
01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:32.230
<v Speaker 5>And I only call him out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not,</v>

2298
01:43:32.231 --> 01:43:34.990
<v Speaker 5>I don't know him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I just despise this type of</v>

2299
01:43:34.991 --> 01:43:37.420
<v Speaker 5>bullying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is kind of arrogance when they are</v>

2300
01:43:37.450 --> 01:43:40.780
<v Speaker 5>incredibly honest,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hardworking scientists that in their</v>

2301
01:43:40.781 --> 01:43:43.390
<v Speaker 5>best way are trying to understand the</v>
<v Speaker 5>world.</v>

2302
01:43:43.930 --> 01:43:46.150
<v Speaker 5>But here's this guy who's got a huge</v>
<v Speaker 5>soapbox.</v>

2303
01:43:46.151 --> 01:43:49.000
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think over a hundred million views and</v>

2304
01:43:49.001 --> 01:43:51.620
<v Speaker 5>visitors on his side.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he's got a big platform.</v>

2305
01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:55.790
<v Speaker 3>He's just denigrating everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of,</v>

2306
01:43:55.791 --> 01:43:59.150
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's the slot out action in that.</v>

2307
01:43:59.300 --> 01:44:01.550
<v Speaker 3>Like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of eyes.</v>

2308
01:44:01.700 --> 01:44:03.140
<v Speaker 3>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're one of those people that</v>

2309
01:44:03.141 --> 01:44:05.780
<v Speaker 3>writes a hate blog,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can get a lot of attention doing</v>

2310
01:44:05.781 --> 01:44:07.520
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And some people become very addicted to</v>

2311
01:44:07.521 --> 01:44:11.060
<v Speaker 3>attention and if you notice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they start repeating those patterns and</v>

2312
01:44:11.061 --> 01:44:15.290
<v Speaker 3>blogging constantly over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then also what he also does is</v>

2313
01:44:15.320 --> 01:44:18.200
<v Speaker 3>anybody who opposes him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he deletes them from the comments,</v>

2314
01:44:18.201 --> 01:44:20.870
<v Speaker 3>even if they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if they're respectful,</v>

2315
01:44:21.080 --> 01:44:22.070
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're an idiot,</v>

2316
01:44:22.100 --> 01:44:23.840
<v Speaker 3>you don't know what you're talking about</v>
<v Speaker 3>and gets rid of any,</v>

2317
01:44:24.260 --> 01:44:27.890
<v Speaker 3>I became aware of him because that whole</v>
<v Speaker 3>Michael Shermer debacle.</v>

2318
01:44:27.920 --> 01:44:29.270
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The rape thing,</v>

2319
01:44:29.271 --> 01:44:30.300
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2320
01:44:30.690 --> 01:44:32.570
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he accused Michael Shermer of rape</v>

2321
01:44:32.571 --> 01:44:36.410
<v Speaker 3>because he had sex with a woman a</v>
<v Speaker 3>consensually while they were both</v>

2322
01:44:36.411 --> 01:44:38.330
<v Speaker 3>intoxicated at a conference.</v>

2323
01:44:38.330 --> 01:44:39.500
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2324
01:44:39.530 --> 01:44:40.100
<v Speaker 3>see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2325
01:44:40.100 --> 01:44:41.090
<v Speaker 3>that's how you got to know him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2326
01:44:41.091 --> 01:44:42.650
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's how I heard of them.</v>

2327
01:44:42.710 --> 01:44:43.730
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2328
01:44:43.731 --> 01:44:46.910
<v Speaker 3>and just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was the way it was done was so</v>

2329
01:44:46.911 --> 01:44:51.911
<v Speaker 3>reckless and so uninformed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you don't know what happened unless</v>

2330
01:44:51.991 --> 01:44:55.460
<v Speaker 3>he were there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also there's photos of Michael</v>

2331
01:44:55.460 --> 01:44:57.980
<v Speaker 3>Shermer and the girl's smiling weeks</v>
<v Speaker 3>after this incident.</v>

2332
01:44:57.981 --> 01:45:01.760
<v Speaker 3>It was all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all very sorted and its ugliness,</v>

2333
01:45:01.761 --> 01:45:05.390
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just to understand what he gets out</v>

2334
01:45:05.391 --> 01:45:09.170
<v Speaker 3>of this sort of frivolous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>diabolical ugliness.</v>

2335
01:45:09.171 --> 01:45:10.760
<v Speaker 3>It's a tension.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a tension maybe.</v>

2336
01:45:10.761 --> 01:45:11.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gets attention.</v>

2337
01:45:11.751 --> 01:45:14.990
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he is the Grand Poobah of the retarded</v>

2338
01:45:14.991 --> 01:45:16.760
<v Speaker 3>social justice warriors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very true.</v>

2339
01:45:17.010 --> 01:45:19.280
<v Speaker 3>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of people like that out</v>

2340
01:45:19.281 --> 01:45:20.450
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's,</v>

2341
01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:22.460
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of attention in doing</v>

2342
01:45:22.461 --> 01:45:24.260
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2343
01:45:24.650 --> 01:45:25.483
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if,</v>

2344
01:45:25.520 --> 01:45:28.910
<v Speaker 3>unfortunately it negates some really</v>
<v Speaker 3>good points that they might have,</v>

2345
01:45:28.940 --> 01:45:32.450
<v Speaker 3>might have about a bunch of different</v>
<v Speaker 3>issues because you have to look at it</v>

2346
01:45:32.451 --> 01:45:35.720
<v Speaker 3>through the lens of this really poisoned</v>
<v Speaker 3>his person.</v>

2347
01:45:35.850 --> 01:45:37.050
<v Speaker 5>Exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2348
01:45:37.051 --> 01:45:38.880
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the first I had heard of him,</v>

2349
01:45:39.330 --> 01:45:42.180
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was there was an incident that happened</v>

2350
01:45:42.181 --> 01:45:45.270
<v Speaker 5>on psychology today with a gentleman by</v>
<v Speaker 5>the name of Satoshi Kanazawa.</v>

2351
01:45:45.350 --> 01:45:46.610
<v Speaker 5>Are you familiar with him?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

2352
01:45:47.030 --> 01:45:52.030
<v Speaker 5>So [inaudible] is a professor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>an evolutionary psychologist at the</v>

2353
01:45:52.140 --> 01:45:52.951
<v Speaker 5>London School of Economics.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a very,</v>

2354
01:45:52.951 --> 01:45:54.570
<v Speaker 5>very prestigious school in London,</v>
<v Speaker 5>England,</v>

2355
01:45:55.040 --> 01:45:58.140
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who was a very popular blogger at cycle</v>

2356
01:45:58.600 --> 01:46:01.890
<v Speaker 5>at psychology today.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But he had a very sort of bombastic</v>

2357
01:46:01.891 --> 01:46:06.870
<v Speaker 5>style of writing that sort of drew a lot</v>
<v Speaker 5>of attention because of the way he</v>

2358
01:46:06.871 --> 01:46:08.280
<v Speaker 5>phrased things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

2359
01:46:08.490 --> 01:46:10.470
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I guess he thought that he was so</v>

2360
01:46:10.471 --> 01:46:14.280
<v Speaker 5>popular that he was sort of untouchable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And at one point he wrote a blog article</v>

2361
01:46:14.700 --> 01:46:19.170
<v Speaker 5>summarizing somebody else's work,</v>
<v Speaker 5>looking at racial differences in</v>

2362
01:46:19.171 --> 01:46:20.850
<v Speaker 5>attractiveness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So for example,</v>

2363
01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:23.470
<v Speaker 5>who's most attractive white women or</v>
<v Speaker 5>black women,</v>

2364
01:46:23.500 --> 01:46:26.970
<v Speaker 5>white men or black men?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And one of the results from that</v>

2365
01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:28.720
<v Speaker 5>Dataset,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this wasn't his own study,</v>

2366
01:46:28.721 --> 01:46:30.210
<v Speaker 5>he was summarizing somebody else's</v>
<v Speaker 5>water,</v>

2367
01:46:30.480 --> 01:46:34.770
<v Speaker 5>was that black women had been rated as</v>
<v Speaker 5>less attractive than white women.</v>

2368
01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:36.960
<v Speaker 5>And he gave some,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess,</v>

2369
01:46:36.961 --> 01:46:39.120
<v Speaker 5>speculative reasons as to why that might</v>
<v Speaker 5>be.</v>

2370
01:46:39.480 --> 01:46:41.450
<v Speaker 5>So that caused a huge,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2371
01:46:41.460 --> 01:46:42.600
<v Speaker 5>fewer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2372
01:46:42.630 --> 01:46:44.550
<v Speaker 5>he's a racist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he's Japanese by the way.</v>

2373
01:46:44.820 --> 01:46:45.960
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a racist.</v>

2374
01:46:45.961 --> 01:46:47.400
<v Speaker 5>He hates blacks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He hates this.</v>

2375
01:46:47.401 --> 01:46:48.240
<v Speaker 5>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

2376
01:46:48.241 --> 01:46:50.730
<v Speaker 5>they tried to get him out of a</v>
<v Speaker 5>psychologist today.</v>

2377
01:46:50.740 --> 01:46:53.430
<v Speaker 5>They eventually kicked him out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They tried to revoke,</v>

2378
01:46:53.550 --> 01:46:58.470
<v Speaker 5>they started a petition to try to revoke</v>
<v Speaker 5>his tenure at London School of</v>

2379
01:46:58.470 --> 01:46:59.820
<v Speaker 5>Economics.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I'll mention two points.</v>

2380
01:46:59.821 --> 01:47:01.280
<v Speaker 5>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2381
01:47:01.830 --> 01:47:05.250
<v Speaker 5>bees at meyers takes this example and</v>
<v Speaker 5>says,</v>

2382
01:47:05.251 --> 01:47:07.830
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's what evolution psychology is.</v>

2383
01:47:08.010 --> 01:47:10.980
<v Speaker 5>Here's this racist who happens to be an</v>
<v Speaker 5>evolution psychologist.</v>

2384
01:47:11.490 --> 01:47:13.650
<v Speaker 5>All evolution psychologists are racist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2385
01:47:13.651 --> 01:47:15.690
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what racism usually is,</v>

2386
01:47:15.691 --> 01:47:17.370
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Give me a generalization.</v>

2387
01:47:17.550 --> 01:47:21.630
<v Speaker 5>I know a friend who is Jewish and who</v>
<v Speaker 5>was caught cheating on his taxes,</v>

2388
01:47:22.070 --> 01:47:26.280
<v Speaker 5>that that shows you Jews cheat when it</v>
<v Speaker 5>comes to money because they're always</v>

2389
01:47:26.281 --> 01:47:27.780
<v Speaker 5>looking to make the most money.</v>

2390
01:47:27.780 --> 01:47:29.400
<v Speaker 5>That's what happens with those jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2391
01:47:29.610 --> 01:47:33.150
<v Speaker 5>So he doesn't see the irony of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So then I wrote an article,</v>

2392
01:47:33.540 --> 01:47:35.170
<v Speaker 5>which I frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you don't want me to say,</v>

2393
01:47:35.180 --> 01:47:39.030
<v Speaker 5>it took a lot of courage where I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you could probably pull it up while</v>

2394
01:47:39.031 --> 01:47:43.620
<v Speaker 5>you could pull it up if you wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where I basically argued that to purge a</v>

2395
01:47:43.621 --> 01:47:46.260
<v Speaker 5>blogger would set a very dangerous</v>
<v Speaker 5>precedent,</v>

2396
01:47:46.261 --> 01:47:50.600
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you disagree with whatever Satoshi</v>

2397
01:47:50.600 --> 01:47:53.490
<v Speaker 5>Kanazawa saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let his words come back to haunt him,</v>

2398
01:47:53.550 --> 01:47:55.320
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>His words will be there.</v>

2399
01:47:55.530 --> 01:47:59.430
<v Speaker 5>If the are truly racist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if he is espousing racial theories that</v>

2400
01:47:59.431 --> 01:48:02.400
<v Speaker 5>are pure quackery,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that will be the biggest punishment he</v>

2401
01:48:02.401 --> 01:48:06.060
<v Speaker 5>could suffer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But to remove him from the discourse,</v>

2402
01:48:06.240 --> 01:48:10.560
<v Speaker 5>the public arena of ideas sets a very</v>
<v Speaker 5>dangerous precedent precedent.</v>

2403
01:48:10.561 --> 01:48:11.281
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>guess what happened?</v>

2404
01:48:11.281 --> 01:48:14.250
<v Speaker 5>A lot of my academic colleagues wrote to</v>
<v Speaker 5>me privately said,</v>

2405
01:48:14.251 --> 01:48:16.740
<v Speaker 5>my God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>thank you for having the courage to</v>

2406
01:48:16.741 --> 01:48:18.720
<v Speaker 5>write that article.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's exactly what I thought.</v>

2407
01:48:18.900 --> 01:48:22.080
<v Speaker 5>But I didn't want to write the article</v>
<v Speaker 5>because then people might think that I'm</v>

2408
01:48:22.081 --> 01:48:25.770
<v Speaker 5>supporting Satoshi.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it shows you that why would this of</v>

2409
01:48:25.771 --> 01:48:28.770
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to me it seemed very natural to write</v>

2410
01:48:28.771 --> 01:48:30.000
<v Speaker 5>that article.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't give a shit.</v>

2411
01:48:30.300 --> 01:48:33.360
<v Speaker 5>I mean I know what's right and I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 5>to support that principle,</v>

2412
01:48:33.361 --> 01:48:37.140
<v Speaker 5>which is you don't ban people based on</v>
<v Speaker 5>ideas that they write.</v>

2413
01:48:37.200 --> 01:48:40.500
<v Speaker 5>Let their ideas come back to haunt them</v>
<v Speaker 5>if they are bad ideas.</v>

2414
01:48:40.830 --> 01:48:41.360
<v Speaker 5>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

2415
01:48:41.360 --> 01:48:45.050
<v Speaker 3>Why is it okay to say that it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

2416
01:48:46.790 --> 01:48:51.790
<v Speaker 3>there's an evolutionary desire for women</v>
<v Speaker 3>to breed with an Alpha male,</v>

2417
01:48:52.700 --> 01:48:54.770
<v Speaker 3>like one of these romance novel guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2418
01:48:54.830 --> 01:48:59.830
<v Speaker 3>Why is it okay to say that women are</v>
<v Speaker 3>more inclined to favor taller men with</v>

2419
01:49:01.011 --> 01:49:06.011
<v Speaker 3>broader shoulders and longer or whatever</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fuck it is or why is it okay to say</v>

2420
01:49:06.681 --> 01:49:09.830
<v Speaker 3>that women are less attractive to obese</v>
<v Speaker 3>short men?</v>

2421
01:49:10.400 --> 01:49:15.400
<v Speaker 3>Why is it okay to say that women or or</v>
<v Speaker 3>that men would be less attractive to</v>

2422
01:49:16.311 --> 01:49:17.960
<v Speaker 3>obese women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a fact,</v>

2423
01:49:18.080 --> 01:49:20.300
<v Speaker 3>but as soon as you involve race,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>

2424
01:49:20.390 --> 01:49:22.940
<v Speaker 3>Then you're not allowed to look at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>actual statistics.</v>

2425
01:49:22.941 --> 01:49:24.740
<v Speaker 3>You're not allowed to look at the real</v>
<v Speaker 3>numbers.</v>

2426
01:49:24.800 --> 01:49:27.020
<v Speaker 3>Have you noticed by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the a hundred meters was very</v>

2427
01:49:27.021 --> 01:49:29.540
<v Speaker 3>racist this year wasn't racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How so?</v>

2428
01:49:29.570 --> 01:49:30.403
<v Speaker 3>Black people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>

2429
01:49:30.750 --> 01:49:33.910
<v Speaker 5>there were no Lebanese Jews who are</v>
<v Speaker 5>overweight that we're in the final,</v>

2430
01:49:33.990 --> 01:49:37.180
<v Speaker 5>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was no proper representation of</v>

2431
01:49:37.181 --> 01:49:40.210
<v Speaker 5>the rich tapestry of humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why were they all black?</v>

2432
01:49:40.211 --> 01:49:41.460
<v Speaker 5>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was clearly racist.</v>

2433
01:49:41.710 --> 01:49:44.740
<v Speaker 5>We're talking about an athletic event.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're not talking about sex,</v>

2434
01:49:44.890 --> 01:49:45.723
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

2435
01:49:45.750 --> 01:49:47.200
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's all sorted</v>

2436
01:49:48.550 --> 01:49:50.920
<v Speaker 1>in many ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2437
01:49:50.980 --> 01:49:54.010
<v Speaker 1>you could make the argument that there</v>
<v Speaker 1>are women that are far more beautiful</v>

2438
01:49:54.011 --> 01:49:56.620
<v Speaker 1>than any of that are black,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are far more beautiful than any</v>

2439
01:49:56.621 --> 01:49:57.460
<v Speaker 1>white woman that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2440
01:49:57.790 --> 01:50:00.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a broad range of attractiveness</v>

2441
01:50:00.251 --> 01:50:02.350
<v Speaker 1>and all sorts of different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2442
01:50:02.370 --> 01:50:04.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different races and creeds and different</v>

2443
01:50:04.751 --> 01:50:07.840
<v Speaker 1>parts of the world and is also be</v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

2444
01:50:07.841 --> 01:50:11.050
<v Speaker 1>People have different things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're attracted to.</v>

2445
01:50:11.080 --> 01:50:13.330
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like some people are attracted to short</v>

2446
01:50:13.331 --> 01:50:15.850
<v Speaker 1>Asian women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people are attracted to tall women</v>

2447
01:50:15.851 --> 01:50:16.750
<v Speaker 1>from Norway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2448
01:50:17.440 --> 01:50:20.620
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of variety in what people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>personal preference.</v>

2449
01:50:20.650 --> 01:50:23.230
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you're just looking at sheer</v>

2450
01:50:23.231 --> 01:50:27.370
<v Speaker 1>numbers and which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure he wasn't saying black women</v>

2451
01:50:27.371 --> 01:50:29.110
<v Speaker 1>are completely unattractive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely not.</v>

2452
01:50:29.111 --> 01:50:30.760
<v Speaker 1>That's in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in the same study,</v>

2453
01:50:30.761 --> 01:50:34.270
<v Speaker 1>if I'm not mistaken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he pointed to the fact that black men</v>

2454
01:50:34.690 --> 01:50:37.150
<v Speaker 1>had been at scored as more attractive.</v>

2455
01:50:37.480 --> 01:50:42.480
<v Speaker 1>So the result that demonstrates a</v>
<v Speaker 1>finding that is racially acceptable is</v>

2456
01:50:43.781 --> 01:50:48.781
<v Speaker 1>gleaned over the one that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>unacceptable then makes him a Kkk Nazi.</v>

2457
01:50:49.370 --> 01:50:51.790
<v Speaker 1>He supposed to do what he's supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>ignore the statistics.</v>

2458
01:50:51.820 --> 01:50:53.280
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Incidentally,</v>

2459
01:50:53.290 --> 01:50:53.681
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2460
01:50:53.681 --> 01:50:54.250
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2461
01:50:54.250 --> 01:50:57.520
<v Speaker 1>the king on this issue as a gentleman by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the name of Phillip Rushton,</v>

2462
01:50:57.820 --> 01:51:01.840
<v Speaker 1>who's now passed away a few years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was a Canadian psychologist who</v>

2463
01:51:01.870 --> 01:51:05.370
<v Speaker 1>spent his career studying racial</v>
<v Speaker 1>differences specifically,</v>

2464
01:51:05.371 --> 01:51:06.460
<v Speaker 1>he studied,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2465
01:51:06.730 --> 01:51:10.960
<v Speaker 1>differences in Iq.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I actually had a personal anecdote</v>

2466
01:51:10.961 --> 01:51:13.840
<v Speaker 1>with him because early on in my career,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2467
01:51:13.940 --> 01:51:16.420
<v Speaker 1>I think two years into my original</v>
<v Speaker 1>professorship,</v>

2468
01:51:16.421 --> 01:51:21.421
<v Speaker 1>I think it was [inaudible] 96 I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving a talk at a conference and this</v>

2469
01:51:22.991 --> 01:51:27.010
<v Speaker 1>hall had maybe 50 a hundred people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I hadn't looked at who were the</v>

2470
01:51:27.011 --> 01:51:30.520
<v Speaker 1>other speakers in my session,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I noticed that people were very,</v>

2471
01:51:30.790 --> 01:51:34.420
<v Speaker 1>seemed there's a lot of poison in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>air and it turned out I should have</v>

2472
01:51:34.421 --> 01:51:36.580
<v Speaker 1>maybe checked before going into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hall,</v>

2473
01:51:36.790 --> 01:51:39.940
<v Speaker 1>that the gentleman who was speaking</v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately before me was this gentleman</v>

2474
01:51:39.941 --> 01:51:42.070
<v Speaker 1>Phillip Rushton and he's going to talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

2475
01:51:42.370 --> 01:51:45.310
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cranial capacity postmortal carrying</v>

2476
01:51:45.311 --> 01:51:47.560
<v Speaker 1>capacity of black men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>black women,</v>

2477
01:51:47.740 --> 01:51:48.940
<v Speaker 1>white men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>white women.</v>

2478
01:51:49.210 --> 01:51:50.920
<v Speaker 1>And then he would show some racial</v>
<v Speaker 1>differences.</v>

2479
01:51:50.921 --> 01:51:54.340
<v Speaker 1>We forget everybody riled up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this was probably the only time ever</v>

2480
01:51:54.341 --> 01:51:58.150
<v Speaker 1>where I was about to give a talk where I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was genuinely terrified because I</v>

2481
01:51:58.151 --> 01:52:00.790
<v Speaker 1>thought that I would just get lynched by</v>
<v Speaker 1>proxy because I'm,</v>

2482
01:52:00.791 --> 01:52:04.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm the next guy in line and they just</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to kill me just because I was next</v>

2483
01:52:04.300 --> 01:52:07.870
<v Speaker 1>on the same stage as him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The good news for me is that after he</v>

2484
01:52:07.871 --> 01:52:08.950
<v Speaker 1>finished his stock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the room,</v>

2485
01:52:08.951 --> 01:52:11.560
<v Speaker 1>let's say I had 1500 people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he finishes a stock.</v>

2486
01:52:11.590 --> 01:52:16.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting ready to go up about 425 out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the 1500 leave to follow him.</v>

2487
01:52:17.140 --> 01:52:19.270
<v Speaker 1>And his new yelled at him to yell at him</v>
<v Speaker 1>to kill her.</v>

2488
01:52:19.960 --> 01:52:23.050
<v Speaker 1>And there's maybe like 75 people in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a room of,</v>

2489
01:52:23.290 --> 01:52:25.570
<v Speaker 1>and I was actually very happy that there</v>
<v Speaker 1>were so few.</v>

2490
01:52:25.870 --> 01:52:30.870
<v Speaker 1>So few people that had stayed at my talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>undeniable physical differences in human</v>

2491
01:52:30.941 --> 01:52:34.270
<v Speaker 1>beings to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to somehow or another say that bringing</v>

2492
01:52:34.271 --> 01:52:36.550
<v Speaker 1>those up is racist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is really strange.</v>

2493
01:52:36.580 --> 01:52:40.540
<v Speaker 1>Like there's just some undeniable</v>
<v Speaker 1>physical differences in bone structure,</v>

2494
01:52:40.541 --> 01:52:44.260
<v Speaker 1>bone density.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just some thing,</v>

2495
01:52:44.261 --> 01:52:45.770
<v Speaker 1>like for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2496
01:52:45.771 --> 01:52:47.210
<v Speaker 1>African American women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2497
01:52:47.240 --> 01:52:52.240
<v Speaker 1>tend to have a higher bone density and</v>
<v Speaker 1>similar bone density to a Caucasian men,</v>

2498
01:52:53.030 --> 01:52:54.620
<v Speaker 1>which is very rare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like in women,</v>

2499
01:52:54.621 --> 01:52:57.350
<v Speaker 1>it's not the same like African American</v>
<v Speaker 1>women have denser bones,</v>

2500
01:52:57.540 --> 01:52:58.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>per capita.</v>

2501
01:52:58.671 --> 01:53:00.710
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>normally rather you've got on average,</v>

2502
01:53:01.130 --> 01:53:02.570
<v Speaker 1>just in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just in general,</v>

2503
01:53:03.680 --> 01:53:06.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who and who knows what the origin of</v>

2504
01:53:06.081 --> 01:53:06.681
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2505
01:53:06.681 --> 01:53:09.230
<v Speaker 1>you could go into that from an</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary standpoint and try to</v>

2506
01:53:09.231 --> 01:53:11.390
<v Speaker 1>figure out what part of the world they</v>
<v Speaker 1>come from,</v>

2507
01:53:11.391 --> 01:53:13.640
<v Speaker 1>what you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what their ancestors did,</v>

2508
01:53:13.730 --> 01:53:16.670
<v Speaker 1>what would have been the selection</v>
<v Speaker 1>pressures that would have resulted in</v>

2509
01:53:16.671 --> 01:53:19.490
<v Speaker 1>this indication that they're fascinating</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>

2510
01:53:19.820 --> 01:53:21.900
<v Speaker 1>Exactly what Phillip Rushton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you still have new,</v>

2511
01:53:21.920 --> 01:53:22.910
<v Speaker 1>he used to argue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2512
01:53:22.940 --> 01:53:24.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a racist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have an agenda.</v>

2513
01:53:25.070 --> 01:53:27.950
<v Speaker 1>I follow an interesting line of</v>
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>

2514
01:53:27.980 --> 01:53:29.900
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here's the data.</v>

2515
01:53:30.320 --> 01:53:34.730
<v Speaker 1>Now I've asked people who were friends</v>
<v Speaker 1>with him privately,</v>

2516
01:53:35.390 --> 01:53:37.190
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what is the deal on the gentleman?</v>

2517
01:53:37.191 --> 01:53:38.300
<v Speaker 1>Is he racist?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is he not?</v>

2518
01:53:38.540 --> 01:53:41.870
<v Speaker 1>And I've never been told by anybody that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a racist.</v>

2519
01:53:41.960 --> 01:53:45.770
<v Speaker 1>But here's where I'm confused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're showing actual skulls and</v>

2520
01:53:45.771 --> 01:53:48.710
<v Speaker 1>you're actually measuring cranial</v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity,</v>

2521
01:53:49.320 --> 01:53:52.550
<v Speaker 1>are you not allowed to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you not allowed to look at the</v>

2522
01:53:52.551 --> 01:53:57.350
<v Speaker 1>differences between Asian people and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Norwegian people?</v>

2523
01:53:57.351 --> 01:54:02.000
<v Speaker 1>Or are people from Antarctica versus how</v>
<v Speaker 1>you not allowed to do that?</v>

2524
01:54:02.001 --> 01:54:04.460
<v Speaker 1>Because it seems kind of crazy if you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>not allowed to.</v>

2525
01:54:04.730 --> 01:54:06.860
<v Speaker 1>So that's part of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a great paper that was published</v>

2526
01:54:06.861 --> 01:54:10.010
<v Speaker 1>I think in 2005 or 2006 either in</v>
<v Speaker 1>science or nature.</v>

2527
01:54:10.430 --> 01:54:13.730
<v Speaker 1>I love the title of the paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's forbidden knowledge and</v>

2528
01:54:13.731 --> 01:54:18.731
<v Speaker 1>it's specifically sort of breaks down</v>
<v Speaker 1>the types of research questions that if</v>

2529
01:54:19.851 --> 01:54:22.910
<v Speaker 1>you want to have a viable career as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientist,</v>

2530
01:54:23.120 --> 01:54:24.350
<v Speaker 1>you should stay away from.</v>

2531
01:54:24.590 --> 01:54:28.760
<v Speaker 1>And I think pretty much on top of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>list is studying racial differences,</v>

2532
01:54:29.090 --> 01:54:34.090
<v Speaker 1>especially racial differences that might</v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually point to a finding that is</v>

2533
01:54:36.441 --> 01:54:37.970
<v Speaker 1>politically incorrect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2534
01:54:38.090 --> 01:54:42.470
<v Speaker 1>That's an excellent way for you to</v>
<v Speaker 1>become the pariah of academia,</v>

2535
01:54:42.471 --> 01:54:45.020
<v Speaker 1>if not more generally the public.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

2536
01:54:45.021 --> 01:54:45.710
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's growth.</v>

2537
01:54:45.710 --> 01:54:49.280
<v Speaker 1>I actually did a sad truth clip on my</v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube channel where I talked about,</v>

2538
01:54:49.310 --> 01:54:52.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>facts are not racist,</v>

2539
01:54:52.460 --> 01:54:54.710
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean w [inaudible] and boolean logic</v>

2540
01:54:54.711 --> 01:54:57.080
<v Speaker 1>and mathematical logic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd take a statement and it's either</v>

2541
01:54:57.081 --> 01:55:00.020
<v Speaker 1>true or false,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has a binary value one or zero,</v>

2542
01:55:00.140 --> 01:55:00.771
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2543
01:55:00.771 --> 01:55:04.160
<v Speaker 1>that's how we create circuitry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>architectural circuitry of a computer,</v>

2544
01:55:04.161 --> 01:55:05.660
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has a truth value.</v>

2545
01:55:05.720 --> 01:55:06.470
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2546
01:55:06.470 --> 01:55:10.220
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea that a statement is racist</v>

2547
01:55:10.550 --> 01:55:11.750
<v Speaker 1>scientifically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2548
01:55:11.780 --> 01:55:15.080
<v Speaker 1>it's either false or not false or</v>
<v Speaker 1>provisionally true.</v>

2549
01:55:15.650 --> 01:55:17.600
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but apparently the argument from the</v>

2550
01:55:17.601 --> 01:55:22.601
<v Speaker 1>other camp is the mere fact that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>asked these questions suggest that there</v>

2551
01:55:23.601 --> 01:55:27.800
<v Speaker 1>must be a reason that is nefarious for</v>
<v Speaker 1>you to ask these questions.</v>

2552
01:55:27.801 --> 01:55:30.200
<v Speaker 1>What is the value in asking that</v>
<v Speaker 1>question?</v>

2553
01:55:30.440 --> 01:55:35.440
<v Speaker 1>So they sort of infer a nefarious motive</v>
<v Speaker 1>to you going down that alley.</v>

2554
01:55:36.950 --> 01:55:38.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't do that.</v>

2555
01:55:38.331 --> 01:55:40.520
<v Speaker 1>And because it's an appeal to ignorance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2556
01:55:40.530 --> 01:55:42.440
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're saying that let's all,</v>

2557
01:55:42.590 --> 01:55:43.800
<v Speaker 1>let's all feign</v>

2558
01:55:44.010 --> 01:55:49.010
<v Speaker 3>ignorance and not look at the actual</v>
<v Speaker 3>facts of just the physical bodies of</v>

2559
01:55:49.591 --> 01:55:53.370
<v Speaker 3>human beings and that they vary based on</v>
<v Speaker 3>climate based on,</v>

2560
01:55:53.460 --> 01:55:54.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

2561
01:55:54.690 --> 01:55:56.400
<v Speaker 3>what area of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

2562
01:55:56.401 --> 01:56:00.180
<v Speaker 3>what the people were up to that were</v>
<v Speaker 3>living there for generation after</v>

2563
01:56:00.181 --> 01:56:03.660
<v Speaker 3>generation that led to the genetics</v>
<v Speaker 3>expressing themselves and the way they</v>

2564
01:56:03.661 --> 01:56:06.930
<v Speaker 3>do in 2016 it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy,</v>

2565
01:56:07.080 --> 01:56:08.760
<v Speaker 3>but it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>

2566
01:56:08.761 --> 01:56:11.850
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like in response to what</v>

2567
01:56:11.851 --> 01:56:14.550
<v Speaker 3>they believe to be illogical criticism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's inevitable.</v>

2568
01:56:14.820 --> 01:56:16.830
<v Speaker 3>It's like this illogical criticism is</v>
<v Speaker 3>inevitable.</v>

2569
01:56:16.831 --> 01:56:21.570
<v Speaker 3>So hedge your bets early and say there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>no difference between the sexes.</v>

2570
01:56:21.571 --> 01:56:24.450
<v Speaker 3>There's no difference between the races.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to get in any arguments.</v>

2571
01:56:24.451 --> 01:56:26.940
<v Speaker 3>I want tenure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want just to want to keep promoting</v>

2572
01:56:26.970 --> 01:56:30.850
<v Speaker 3>ignorance at an institution of learning</v>
<v Speaker 3>Zap,</v>

2573
01:56:30.990 --> 01:56:32.220
<v Speaker 3>which is bananas.</v>

2574
01:56:32.370 --> 01:56:34.310
<v Speaker 5>Is it that the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's how you remember already were</v>

2575
01:56:34.311 --> 01:56:35.990
<v Speaker 5>asking me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So who are some of these,</v>

2576
01:56:35.991 --> 01:56:39.850
<v Speaker 5>the tractors of evolutionary psychology?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what you just mentioned kind of can</v>

2577
01:56:39.860 --> 01:56:44.860
<v Speaker 5>bring us back to that point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some of the early proponents of sort of</v>

2578
01:56:45.381 --> 01:56:50.381
<v Speaker 5>this anti evolutionary position came</v>
<v Speaker 5>from anthropologists who saw the</v>

2579
01:56:52.281 --> 01:56:57.281
<v Speaker 5>potential for biology being misused or</v>
<v Speaker 5>Darwinian theory to be misused,</v>

2580
01:56:57.381 --> 01:56:58.930
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the Nazis can,</v>

2581
01:56:59.550 --> 01:57:00.770
<v Speaker 5>can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>can refer to,</v>

2582
01:57:01.060 --> 01:57:02.150
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Darwinian theory.</v>

2583
01:57:02.151 --> 01:57:04.730
<v Speaker 5>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a struggle between the races and</v>

2584
01:57:04.731 --> 01:57:08.240
<v Speaker 5>we are the areas the Jews lost.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what's wrong with getting rid of</v>

2585
01:57:08.241 --> 01:57:09.110
<v Speaker 5>them?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's Darwinian.</v>

2586
01:57:09.140 --> 01:57:10.430
<v Speaker 5>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it has nothing to do with Darwinian</v>

2587
01:57:10.431 --> 01:57:13.190
<v Speaker 5>theory,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I the assert the theory for my</v>

2588
01:57:13.191 --> 01:57:16.610
<v Speaker 5>nefarious pursuits.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A British class elitists said,</v>

2589
01:57:16.611 --> 01:57:18.600
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a struggle between the uh,</v>

2590
01:57:18.830 --> 01:57:20.720
<v Speaker 5>classes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We are the upper class.</v>

2591
01:57:20.780 --> 01:57:23.060
<v Speaker 5>Who cares if the lower class are</v>
<v Speaker 5>eliminated?</v>

2592
01:57:23.060 --> 01:57:24.770
<v Speaker 5>If we don't fund them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if we don't give them healthcare,</v>

2593
01:57:24.830 --> 01:57:26.990
<v Speaker 5>if we don't educate them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's natural selection.</v>

2594
01:57:27.210 --> 01:57:31.310
<v Speaker 5>You Genesis said the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what's wrong if we sterilize,</v>

2595
01:57:31.490 --> 01:57:33.290
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people who are dull,</v>

2596
01:57:33.350 --> 01:57:36.290
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>mentally deficient people who are maybe</v>

2597
01:57:36.291 --> 01:57:38.420
<v Speaker 5>a bit too dark,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people who are homosexual,</v>

2598
01:57:38.600 --> 01:57:40.790
<v Speaker 5>hey that's cleaning out the gene pool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey that's Darwinian,</v>

2599
01:57:40.791 --> 01:57:43.010
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So some anthropologists thought,</v>

2600
01:57:43.250 --> 01:57:43.760
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2601
01:57:43.760 --> 01:57:48.760
<v Speaker 5>there is going to be misuse of biology.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So let's now create a new world view</v>

2602
01:57:50.210 --> 01:57:53.510
<v Speaker 5>built on bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the edifice is built on bullshit</v>

2603
01:57:53.511 --> 01:57:55.760
<v Speaker 5>after bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but at least there won't be an</v>

2604
01:57:55.761 --> 01:57:59.720
<v Speaker 5>opportunity for people to otherwise</v>
<v Speaker 5>misuse biology.</v>

2605
01:57:59.721 --> 01:58:03.560
<v Speaker 5>And so how do they express that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They created a narrative that basically</v>

2606
01:58:03.561 --> 01:58:07.910
<v Speaker 5>says that cultural relativism is what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The fines,</v>

2607
01:58:07.911 --> 01:58:10.190
<v Speaker 5>humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Every culture is unique.</v>

2608
01:58:10.220 --> 01:58:13.130
<v Speaker 5>Every culture is different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There is no such thing as human</v>

2609
01:58:13.131 --> 01:58:13.940
<v Speaker 5>universals.</v>

2610
01:58:13.940 --> 01:58:18.940
<v Speaker 5>Cause that would necessitate biological</v>
<v Speaker 5>commonalities which we don't accept.</v>

2611
01:58:19.340 --> 01:58:23.840
<v Speaker 5>And so therefore for a hundred years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>anthropology departments have been built</v>

2612
01:58:23.870 --> 01:58:27.920
<v Speaker 5>on an edifice of pure bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at least the cultural anthropologists.</v>

2613
01:58:28.070 --> 01:58:30.410
<v Speaker 5>The Bio anthropologists recognize</v>
<v Speaker 5>biology.</v>

2614
01:58:30.650 --> 01:58:33.560
<v Speaker 5>But the cultural anthropologists are</v>
<v Speaker 5>driven by a premise of cultural</v>

2615
01:58:33.561 --> 01:58:36.080
<v Speaker 5>relativism,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which incidentally on our common friend</v>

2616
01:58:36.081 --> 01:58:39.260
<v Speaker 5>Sam Harris,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it tells a great story about moral</v>

2617
01:58:39.261 --> 01:58:41.620
<v Speaker 5>relativism.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I hope I don't watch the story,</v>

2618
01:58:41.621 --> 01:58:45.190
<v Speaker 5>but apparently he was at a conference</v>
<v Speaker 5>somewhere where he had a chance to speak</v>

2619
01:58:45.191 --> 01:58:49.930
<v Speaker 5>to the bioethicist who is sitting on the</v>
<v Speaker 5>president's commission on bioethics.</v>

2620
01:58:50.140 --> 01:58:53.560
<v Speaker 5>And she apparently is a sort of moral</v>
<v Speaker 5>relativist stipe.</v>

2621
01:58:53.860 --> 01:58:56.710
<v Speaker 5>And he asks her,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are you sure that there are no universal</v>

2622
01:58:56.711 --> 01:58:57.580
<v Speaker 5>moral truths?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2623
01:58:57.790 --> 01:59:01.990
<v Speaker 5>are you not able to pronounce a position</v>
<v Speaker 5>on whether if there were a culture where</v>

2624
01:59:02.260 --> 01:59:07.060
<v Speaker 5>people were told that every fourth child</v>
<v Speaker 5>has to have his eyes gouged so that he</v>

2625
01:59:07.061 --> 01:59:11.230
<v Speaker 5>can walk towards the light without eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>would you support?</v>

2626
01:59:11.440 --> 01:59:12.760
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who am I to judge?</v>

2627
01:59:12.970 --> 01:59:17.970
<v Speaker 5>So this bio ethicists was unable to pass</v>
<v Speaker 5>a moral judgment as to whether if you</v>

2628
01:59:19.511 --> 01:59:23.860
<v Speaker 5>had a religious narrative that says that</v>
<v Speaker 5>every fourth child should have his eyes</v>

2629
01:59:23.861 --> 01:59:26.830
<v Speaker 5>gouged out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she couldn't pronounce the position.</v>

2630
01:59:27.070 --> 01:59:29.830
<v Speaker 5>And the reason why she couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she because she is shackled,</v>

2631
01:59:29.831 --> 01:59:34.000
<v Speaker 5>she's intellectually shackled by the</v>
<v Speaker 5>narrative of cultural relativism.</v>

2632
01:59:34.001 --> 01:59:37.120
<v Speaker 5>Who are we to judge other culture.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the lack of criticism for things</v>

2633
01:59:37.121 --> 01:59:41.530
<v Speaker 5>like female genital mutilation in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>Islam and that's why the ca strata and</v>

2634
01:59:41.531 --> 01:59:46.360
<v Speaker 5>chief Justin true though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why when he was not before he was</v>

2635
01:59:46.361 --> 01:59:48.730
<v Speaker 5>prime minister,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when he was a minister in parliament,</v>

2636
01:59:49.090 --> 01:59:54.090
<v Speaker 5>he got very upset when somebody referred</v>
<v Speaker 5>to child bride honor,</v>

2637
01:59:54.461 --> 01:59:56.560
<v Speaker 5>killing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>genital mutilation,</v>

2638
01:59:56.590 --> 01:59:59.650
<v Speaker 5>throwing acid in their faces when they</v>
<v Speaker 5>refuse marriage,</v>

2639
01:59:59.660 --> 02:00:00.730
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2640
02:00:00.850 --> 02:00:04.420
<v Speaker 5>somebody referred to these practices as</v>
<v Speaker 5>barbaric and there is no place for the</v>

2641
02:00:04.421 --> 02:00:05.320
<v Speaker 5>Mccain society.</v>

2642
02:00:05.620 --> 02:00:10.620
<v Speaker 5>He didn't get upset by those practices.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He got upset by the other politician</v>

2643
02:00:11.141 --> 02:00:13.870
<v Speaker 5>referring to them as barbera.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that true?</v>

2644
02:00:13.930 --> 02:00:14.800
<v Speaker 5>That is true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look it up.</v>

2645
02:00:15.280 --> 02:00:17.710
<v Speaker 5>Then he later came out and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hedged and so on.</v>

2646
02:00:17.800 --> 02:00:21.280
<v Speaker 5>Of course after criticism of course,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he's responding to that standard</v>

2647
02:00:21.281 --> 02:00:26.110
<v Speaker 5>social justice warrior sort of creed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He is the king and we've talked about</v>

2648
02:00:26.111 --> 02:00:27.580
<v Speaker 5>this I think last time on the show</v>
<v Speaker 5>briefly.</v>

2649
02:00:27.760 --> 02:00:30.580
<v Speaker 5>He is the king of the social justice</v>
<v Speaker 5>warriors.</v>

2650
02:00:30.790 --> 02:00:35.790
<v Speaker 5>He is taking down Canada to meet where</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sweden and the rest of the European hell</v>

2651
02:00:36.001 --> 02:00:38.920
<v Speaker 5>holes are not becoming as fast as he</v>
<v Speaker 5>can.</v>

2652
02:00:39.490 --> 02:00:40.930
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is his motivation?</v>

2653
02:00:41.200 --> 02:00:42.110
<v Speaker 5>I think he's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

2654
02:00:42.120 --> 02:00:46.690
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it's because he's an evil</v>
<v Speaker 5>guy who you know has nefarious ulterior</v>

2655
02:00:46.691 --> 02:00:49.480
<v Speaker 5>motives.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think he is simply profoundly</v>

2656
02:00:49.481 --> 02:00:52.570
<v Speaker 5>misguided because of all the bullshit</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you and I have talked about through</v>

2657
02:00:52.571 --> 02:00:53.350
<v Speaker 5>the years.</v>

2658
02:00:53.350 --> 02:00:58.180
<v Speaker 5>He comes from a environment of social</v>
<v Speaker 5>justice warriors.</v>

2659
02:00:58.181 --> 02:01:03.040
<v Speaker 5>His Dad was the architect.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pure true though was the architect of</v>

2660
02:01:03.041 --> 02:01:05.440
<v Speaker 5>multiculturalism and Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

2661
02:01:05.441 --> 02:01:07.660
<v Speaker 5>multiculturalism,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as we may or may not have discussed on</v>

2662
02:01:07.661 --> 02:01:09.700
<v Speaker 5>the show before,</v>
<v Speaker 5>has two different meanings.</v>

2663
02:01:09.701 --> 02:01:11.860
<v Speaker 5>We could talk about multiculturalism.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As you know,</v>

2664
02:01:11.861 --> 02:01:15.670
<v Speaker 5>there are many cultures in Orange County</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's multicultural but</v>

2665
02:01:15.671 --> 02:01:18.100
<v Speaker 5>multiculturalism as a political</v>
<v Speaker 5>philosophy,</v>

2666
02:01:18.370 --> 02:01:22.480
<v Speaker 5>as the idea that when people come to</v>
<v Speaker 5>your land you don't ask them to</v>

2667
02:01:22.481 --> 02:01:26.680
<v Speaker 5>assimilate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You rejoice in the fact that everybody</v>

2668
02:01:26.710 --> 02:01:30.790
<v Speaker 5>has their unique,</v>
<v Speaker 5>distinct cultures where they can express</v>

2669
02:01:30.791 --> 02:01:32.560
<v Speaker 5>themselves in any way that they can.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2670
02:01:32.561 --> 02:01:35.290
<v Speaker 5>of course in some cases that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When it comes to cuisine,</v>

2671
02:01:36.010 --> 02:01:39.340
<v Speaker 5>it's not fine when it comes to let's cut</v>
<v Speaker 5>off some cliteracy his right,</v>

2672
02:01:39.341 --> 02:01:40.010
<v Speaker 5>I don't where</v>

2673
02:01:40.010 --> 02:01:44.580
<v Speaker 3>it's not fine when it comes to genocidal</v>
<v Speaker 3>hatred of the Jews honor killings and on</v>

2674
02:01:44.581 --> 02:01:46.610
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But from his perspective,</v>

2675
02:01:46.640 --> 02:01:51.640
<v Speaker 3>he is simply shackled by his inability</v>
<v Speaker 3>to have a clear moral compass that says</v>

2676
02:01:51.950 --> 02:01:53.900
<v Speaker 3>this is right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is wrong.</v>

2677
02:01:54.110 --> 02:01:58.880
<v Speaker 3>Because all he sees as the parasites in</v>
<v Speaker 3>his brain that says,</v>

2678
02:01:58.940 --> 02:02:02.150
<v Speaker 3>who am I to judge?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well judge Asshole,</v>

2679
02:02:02.160 --> 02:02:04.550
<v Speaker 3>they are thumb some things that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>right and some things that are wrong.</v>

2680
02:02:05.300 --> 02:02:07.850
<v Speaker 3>And when we're talking about things like</v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

2681
02:02:07.880 --> 02:02:12.880
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>objecting to the analysis of cranial</v>

2682
02:02:12.891 --> 02:02:16.700
<v Speaker 3>capacity of different people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could see why some people would be</v>

2683
02:02:16.701 --> 02:02:20.030
<v Speaker 3>uncomfortable with that because I could</v>
<v Speaker 3>see how some people would perceive that</v>

2684
02:02:20.031 --> 02:02:22.460
<v Speaker 3>as being some sort of a justification</v>
<v Speaker 3>for racism.</v>

2685
02:02:22.670 --> 02:02:25.520
<v Speaker 3>And so there was stand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as a person who is not racist,</v>

2686
02:02:25.580 --> 02:02:27.440
<v Speaker 3>I'm not racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you are either.</v>

2687
02:02:28.130 --> 02:02:29.720
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we're discussing this,</v>

2688
02:02:29.721 --> 02:02:34.670
<v Speaker 3>it becomes a matter of just being a very</v>
<v Speaker 3>curious biological trait,</v>

2689
02:02:34.770 --> 02:02:35.030
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2690
02:02:35.030 --> 02:02:37.520
<v Speaker 3>And it doesn't make someone superior or</v>
<v Speaker 3>inferior.</v>

2691
02:02:37.521 --> 02:02:40.790
<v Speaker 3>It makes someone different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's fascinating to me because I'm</v>

2692
02:02:40.791 --> 02:02:45.791
<v Speaker 3>looking at the human evolution of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>species as being this massive complex</v>

2693
02:02:46.580 --> 02:02:50.920
<v Speaker 3>algorithm that's been going on since the</v>
<v Speaker 3>beginning of single celled organisms</v>

2694
02:02:50.930 --> 02:02:54.440
<v Speaker 3>branching off into multicell organism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's has been this process of</v>

2695
02:02:54.441 --> 02:02:59.441
<v Speaker 3>change and what has made this process so</v>
<v Speaker 3>that people that live in Iceland are so</v>

2696
02:03:00.501 --> 02:03:01.790
<v Speaker 3>big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2697
02:03:01.791 --> 02:03:04.430
<v Speaker 3>you look at those men that when those</v>
<v Speaker 3>strong man competitions,</v>

2698
02:03:04.431 --> 02:03:06.170
<v Speaker 3>how many of them are from fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>Iceland?</v>

2699
02:03:06.440 --> 02:03:08.180
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what is that?</v>

2700
02:03:08.300 --> 02:03:10.100
<v Speaker 3>What it was it viking genetics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

2701
02:03:10.101 --> 02:03:11.390
<v Speaker 3>well what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tell me what happened.</v>

2702
02:03:11.540 --> 02:03:13.730
<v Speaker 3>Why are their bones so big?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why they're so tall?</v>

2703
02:03:13.880 --> 02:03:17.000
<v Speaker 3>Like what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it about certain people in</v>

2704
02:03:17.001 --> 02:03:20.450
<v Speaker 3>Africa?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Marathon runners are always from east</v>

2705
02:03:20.451 --> 02:03:21.960
<v Speaker 3>Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2706
02:03:22.050 --> 02:03:23.300
<v Speaker 3>Was it West Africa?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2707
02:03:23.301 --> 02:03:25.000
<v Speaker 3>east Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which ones is West Africa?</v>

2708
02:03:25.390 --> 02:03:27.140
<v Speaker 3>Africa as the sprinters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's funny,</v>

2709
02:03:27.141 --> 02:03:28.880
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their muscles structures are very</v>

2710
02:03:28.881 --> 02:03:29.430
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2711
02:03:29.430 --> 02:03:33.650
<v Speaker 3>Slow twitch versus the longer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the east African soul,</v>

2712
02:03:33.770 --> 02:03:38.770
<v Speaker 3>Ethiopians and Eritreans and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kenyans have these elevated bodies that</v>

2713
02:03:38.811 --> 02:03:43.811
<v Speaker 3>are just built for a long distance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other guys are packed muscles.</v>

2714
02:03:44.541 --> 02:03:45.620
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2715
02:03:45.660 --> 02:03:50.060
<v Speaker 3>that's why you get those differences</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is not viewed as racist because</v>

2716
02:03:50.061 --> 02:03:52.370
<v Speaker 3>ultimately you're talking about success.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Success,</v>

2717
02:03:52.420 --> 02:03:53.990
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>On the other hand,</v>

2718
02:03:53.991 --> 02:03:58.991
<v Speaker 3>if you talk about race a as somehow less</v>
<v Speaker 3>good at something than race be and where</v>

2719
02:03:59.111 --> 02:04:02.570
<v Speaker 3>race a scores high on the victimology</v>
<v Speaker 3>Olympics,</v>

2720
02:04:02.571 --> 02:04:04.310
<v Speaker 3>forgive the pun and you're screwed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2721
02:04:04.311 --> 02:04:07.730
<v Speaker 3>that there was a fantastic radiolab</v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast that dealt with,</v>

2722
02:04:07.731 --> 02:04:09.710
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people from one particular part of the</v>

2723
02:04:09.711 --> 02:04:11.990
<v Speaker 3>world that were amazing at running.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2724
02:04:11.991 --> 02:04:15.590
<v Speaker 3>they were talking about their ability to</v>
<v Speaker 3>endure pain because of the rituals that</v>

2725
02:04:15.591 --> 02:04:16.040
<v Speaker 3>they were.</v>

2726
02:04:16.040 --> 02:04:18.230
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had to endure the rites of passage</v>

2727
02:04:18.231 --> 02:04:21.380
<v Speaker 3>as Madison there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their circumcision done with like sharp</v>

2728
02:04:21.381 --> 02:04:24.850
<v Speaker 3>sticks and having to crawl naked through</v>
<v Speaker 3>thorn bushes and,</v>

2729
02:04:24.851 --> 02:04:27.980
<v Speaker 3>and like really dark,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dark shit that they had to do.</v>

2730
02:04:28.160 --> 02:04:31.010
<v Speaker 3>And it was interesting because one guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>who had gone through that and became</v>

2731
02:04:31.011 --> 02:04:35.330
<v Speaker 3>this unbelievably successful runner and</v>
<v Speaker 3>just had this unbelievable ability to</v>

2732
02:04:35.331 --> 02:04:38.160
<v Speaker 3>shut off the pain signal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like to ignore it,</v>

2733
02:04:38.490 --> 02:04:42.210
<v Speaker 3>but he was also talking about who we</v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't want his son to go through that</v>

2734
02:04:42.211 --> 02:04:45.570
<v Speaker 3>same process and that he believes that</v>
<v Speaker 3>the benefits are not worth it.</v>

2735
02:04:46.140 --> 02:04:49.050
<v Speaker 3>And that remember what culture that was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2736
02:04:49.051 --> 02:04:49.950
<v Speaker 3>I do not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2737
02:04:49.980 --> 02:04:52.380
<v Speaker 3>Jamie could probably pull that up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's probably looking it up right now,</v>

2738
02:04:52.410 --> 02:04:54.290
<v Speaker 3>but it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an unfortunately,</v>

2739
02:04:54.291 --> 02:04:56.670
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I listen to like five podcasts a day,</v>

2740
02:04:56.671 --> 02:04:58.830
<v Speaker 3>so probably a fucking million podcasts</v>
<v Speaker 3>ago.</v>

2741
02:04:58.920 --> 02:05:01.410
<v Speaker 3>What is it going Kenyan runners?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a Kenyan,</v>

2742
02:05:01.590 --> 02:05:06.540
<v Speaker 3>but it's a particular part of Kenya</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a very small population of people by</v>

2743
02:05:06.541 --> 02:05:09.270
<v Speaker 3>the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that engage in this like really brutal</v>

2744
02:05:09.271 --> 02:05:12.690
<v Speaker 3>ritual of manhood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a rite of passage.</v>

2745
02:05:12.960 --> 02:05:13.870
<v Speaker 3>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2746
02:05:13.950 --> 02:05:14.431
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2747
02:05:14.431 --> 02:05:16.510
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is fascinating how the,</v>

2748
02:05:16.650 --> 02:05:18.420
<v Speaker 3>is this it right here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2749
02:05:19.170 --> 02:05:20.490
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2750
02:05:20.930 --> 02:05:23.890
<v Speaker 3>Collagen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Collagen people pursue,</v>

2751
02:05:23.940 --> 02:05:26.190
<v Speaker 3>pursue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>produced an astonishing number of great</v>

2752
02:05:26.191 --> 02:05:28.800
<v Speaker 3>long distance runners.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Subpopulation of Kenyans.</v>

2753
02:05:28.890 --> 02:05:29.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those,</v>

2754
02:05:29.931 --> 02:05:31.980
<v Speaker 3>that practice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those rites of passage.</v>

2755
02:05:32.040 --> 02:05:33.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2756
02:05:33.061 --> 02:05:38.061
<v Speaker 3>So it's not just biology with them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's also this unbelievable ability</v>

2757
02:05:38.641 --> 02:05:39.441
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to die.</v>

2758
02:05:39.441 --> 02:05:42.300
<v Speaker 3>And it's called the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the actual episodes called cut and run</v>

2759
02:05:42.510 --> 02:05:46.170
<v Speaker 3>because it's about circumcision,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about what they're forced to do while</v>

2760
02:05:46.171 --> 02:05:48.510
<v Speaker 3>they have a stick poking through their</v>
<v Speaker 3>dick.</v>

2761
02:05:48.900 --> 02:05:53.070
<v Speaker 3>It's really hardcore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that this ability to shut off pain</v>

2762
02:05:53.100 --> 02:05:56.130
<v Speaker 3>and ability to endure is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

2763
02:05:56.280 --> 02:06:00.180
<v Speaker 3>a key factor in their ability to succeed</v>
<v Speaker 3>in running that it's a mental toughness</v>

2764
02:06:00.181 --> 02:06:00.720
<v Speaker 3>thing as well.</v>

2765
02:06:00.720 --> 02:06:05.430
<v Speaker 3>Like they've maybe perhaps turned on</v>
<v Speaker 3>this aspect of their brain and he's</v>

2766
02:06:05.440 --> 02:06:06.120
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2767
02:06:06.120 --> 02:06:08.310
<v Speaker 3>And have you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have you heard of this other rite of</v>

2768
02:06:08.311 --> 02:06:08.861
<v Speaker 3>passage?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2769
02:06:08.861 --> 02:06:11.640
<v Speaker 3>I talk about this one of my books that</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the bull ants?</v>

2770
02:06:11.900 --> 02:06:13.800
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2771
02:06:14.210 --> 02:06:15.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know a guy who's been bitten by one.</v>

2772
02:06:15.871 --> 02:06:19.170
<v Speaker 3>My friend Steve,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my friend Steve was in Bolivia.</v>

2773
02:06:19.230 --> 02:06:23.460
<v Speaker 3>He was there filming his show called</v>
<v Speaker 3>meat eater and he went down there and</v>

2774
02:06:23.461 --> 02:06:26.310
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he got a bullet ant bite in his foot and</v>

2775
02:06:26.311 --> 02:06:29.550
<v Speaker 3>he said it was so unbelievably scores</v>
<v Speaker 3>the high.</v>

2776
02:06:29.820 --> 02:06:32.160
<v Speaker 3>So there's a paint quotient,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

2777
02:06:32.161 --> 02:06:35.910
<v Speaker 3>I don't know the exact metric,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but apparently the bullet ant scores the</v>

2778
02:06:35.911 --> 02:06:37.220
<v Speaker 3>highest on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2779
02:06:37.250 --> 02:06:41.010
<v Speaker 3>And so this particular peoples in their</v>
<v Speaker 3>rite of passage,</v>

2780
02:06:41.210 --> 02:06:42.150
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could probably pull,</v>

2781
02:06:42.151 --> 02:06:44.070
<v Speaker 3>they take a glove,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they take gloves,</v>

2782
02:06:44.100 --> 02:06:47.190
<v Speaker 3>they said date the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ants.</v>

2783
02:06:47.640 --> 02:06:51.840
<v Speaker 3>When the ants wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they start stinging the hands that are</v>

2784
02:06:51.841 --> 02:06:52.530
<v Speaker 3>in those gloves.</v>

2785
02:06:52.530 --> 02:06:56.590
<v Speaker 3>So they are multiple of these bites,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dozens all over the globe,</v>

2786
02:06:56.591 --> 02:07:00.120
<v Speaker 3>all over the glove.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they have to do that ritual I think</v>

2787
02:07:00.121 --> 02:07:05.121
<v Speaker 3>if I'm not mistaken 20 times before they</v>
<v Speaker 3>are accepted as man or someone who could</v>

2788
02:07:06.721 --> 02:07:08.640
<v Speaker 3>take a fucking been there you go there</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2789
02:07:08.641 --> 02:07:12.040
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the amount of pain that you would endure</v>

2790
02:07:12.041 --> 02:07:14.210
<v Speaker 3>it by doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just the,</v>

2791
02:07:14.250 --> 02:07:18.180
<v Speaker 3>there was a guy from Australia that did</v>
<v Speaker 3>it for a,</v>

2792
02:07:18.240 --> 02:07:20.670
<v Speaker 3>some sort of a television special and</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of going to the hospital.</v>

2793
02:07:20.940 --> 02:07:21.830
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2794
02:07:21.831 --> 02:07:24.570
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see the pain in his face while he's</v>

2795
02:07:24.571 --> 02:07:26.950
<v Speaker 3>doing it credible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They say it's like getting your hand</v>

2796
02:07:26.951 --> 02:07:30.140
<v Speaker 3>slammed in a car door 24 hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Incredible.</v>

2797
02:07:30.170 --> 02:07:32.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it lasts a long time.</v>

2798
02:07:32.281 --> 02:07:35.010
<v Speaker 3>It lasts for hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was interesting is my friend Steve,</v>

2799
02:07:35.380 --> 02:07:36.160
<v Speaker 3>he got stung</v>

2800
02:07:36.160 --> 02:07:39.520
<v Speaker 1>by this bullet and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably painful for about an hour</v>

2801
02:07:39.521 --> 02:07:41.080
<v Speaker 1>or two hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like where you just like,</v>

2802
02:07:41.081 --> 02:07:42.990
<v Speaker 1>you can't believe how much pain you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>in during.</v>

2803
02:07:43.270 --> 02:07:46.810
<v Speaker 1>And then he said after that he could</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember which ankle got stung.</v>

2804
02:07:47.430 --> 02:07:49.120
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just goes away.</v>

2805
02:07:49.600 --> 02:07:51.340
<v Speaker 1>It goes away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he's just walking through the</v>

2806
02:07:51.341 --> 02:07:52.870
<v Speaker 1>woods with these people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

2807
02:07:52.871 --> 02:07:55.990
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to remember the name of the</v>

2808
02:07:55.991 --> 02:07:58.060
<v Speaker 1>people in Amazon via,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

2809
02:07:58.780 --> 02:08:01.630
<v Speaker 1>We'll try to remember the name of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that he was.</v>

2810
02:08:01.631 --> 02:08:04.120
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>

2811
02:08:04.180 --> 02:08:05.470
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking of bullets,</v>

2812
02:08:05.471 --> 02:08:07.630
<v Speaker 1>can I tell you another story short on</v>
<v Speaker 1>this vacation?</v>

2813
02:08:07.890 --> 02:08:11.590
<v Speaker 1>So I have a FBI special agent friend</v>
<v Speaker 1>here in southern California,</v>

2814
02:08:12.010 --> 02:08:15.070
<v Speaker 1>and so I know Fred,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fred.</v>

2815
02:08:15.100 --> 02:08:15.671
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've met him.</v>

2816
02:08:15.671 --> 02:08:16.610
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

2817
02:08:16.960 --> 02:08:17.950
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2818
02:08:17.951 --> 02:08:20.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so his last name now I won't,</v>

2819
02:08:20.980 --> 02:08:22.720
<v Speaker 1>I won't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

2820
02:08:22.721 --> 02:08:27.721
<v Speaker 1>we'd met Fred and I met another</v>
<v Speaker 1>gentleman who is a CIA operative and we</v>

2821
02:08:29.051 --> 02:08:31.000
<v Speaker 1>went out that conversation should young.</v>

2822
02:08:31.650 --> 02:08:33.010
<v Speaker 1>Oh boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2823
02:08:33.040 --> 02:08:35.890
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'll give a little few hence</v>
<v Speaker 1>later.</v>

2824
02:08:36.100 --> 02:08:38.560
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he took me out to a,</v>

2825
02:08:38.650 --> 02:08:42.550
<v Speaker 1>cause we've talked about bullets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I asked him if we could go to a shooting</v>

2826
02:08:42.551 --> 02:08:44.110
<v Speaker 1>range and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>

2827
02:08:44.111 --> 02:08:46.840
<v Speaker 1>let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he brought his whole arsenal of FBI</v>

2828
02:08:46.841 --> 02:08:50.290
<v Speaker 1>stuff and he had another friend with him</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was a security type guy.</v>

2829
02:08:50.710 --> 02:08:52.600
<v Speaker 1>And so I went shooting for the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>time ever.</v>

2830
02:08:52.601 --> 02:08:54.060
<v Speaker 1>Even though I've never shot a gun</v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

2831
02:08:54.130 --> 02:08:55.480
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though I've grown up in the</v>

2832
02:08:55.481 --> 02:08:59.620
<v Speaker 1>Lebanese civil war and I had held the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a question Kalashnikov.</v>

2833
02:08:59.980 --> 02:09:02.050
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd never fired a gun.</v>

2834
02:09:02.980 --> 02:09:05.380
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was something that's interesting.</v>

2835
02:09:05.410 --> 02:09:08.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess you shoot your hunt,</v>

2836
02:09:09.010 --> 02:09:09.843
<v Speaker 1>correct?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2837
02:09:09.910 --> 02:09:11.870
<v Speaker 1>But you hunt with a bow and Arrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>correct.</v>

2838
02:09:11.910 --> 02:09:13.090
<v Speaker 1>Hunt with a rifle you've had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2839
02:09:13.220 --> 02:09:14.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these animals you see around your</v>

2840
02:09:14.561 --> 02:09:16.330
<v Speaker 1>shot with a rifle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rifle,</v>

2841
02:09:16.331 --> 02:09:17.290
<v Speaker 1>that one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that one,</v>

2842
02:09:17.670 --> 02:09:19.840
<v Speaker 1>the one outside with the shot that with</v>
<v Speaker 1>a rifle too.</v>

2843
02:09:19.890 --> 02:09:22.410
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I've shot things with both bone</v>

2844
02:09:22.411 --> 02:09:24.600
<v Speaker 1>marrow and rifle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when was the first time that you ever</v>

2845
02:09:24.610 --> 02:09:25.870
<v Speaker 1>shot?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Four years ago.</v>

2846
02:09:25.900 --> 02:09:26.690
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2847
02:09:26.690 --> 02:09:27.700
<v Speaker 1>not just guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2848
02:09:27.701 --> 02:09:28.760
<v Speaker 1>long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A long time ago.</v>

2849
02:09:28.990 --> 02:09:31.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was unbelievable.</v>

2850
02:09:31.031 --> 02:09:33.730
<v Speaker 1>It was really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a lot more,</v>

2851
02:09:33.790 --> 02:09:34.840
<v Speaker 1>he told me actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

2852
02:09:34.841 --> 02:09:35.201
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

2853

<v Speaker 1>either you'll be the type of guy who go</v>

2854
02:09:40.121 --> 02:09:45.121
<v Speaker 1>there and we'll use the two hours or</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll shoot once and you'll say,</v>

2855
02:09:45.910 --> 02:09:47.830
<v Speaker 1>this is not for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like it and we'll leave.</v>

2856
02:09:47.950 --> 02:09:51.990
<v Speaker 1>Cause I was asking him what should my</v>
<v Speaker 1>wife gets come back to pick me up at?</v>

2857
02:09:52.120 --> 02:09:54.040
<v Speaker 1>Well I turned out that I stayed for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>full two hours,</v>

2858
02:09:54.220 --> 02:09:58.720
<v Speaker 1>but I can understand sort of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the response that people might have</v>

2859
02:09:58.721 --> 02:09:59.670
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the,</v>

2860
02:09:59.950 --> 02:10:02.620
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot more powerful than you think.</v>

2861
02:10:02.620 --> 02:10:02.891
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2862
02:10:02.891 --> 02:10:04.390
<v Speaker 1>you could speak to this probably better</v>
<v Speaker 1>than I can.</v>

2863
02:10:04.730 --> 02:10:07.280
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shot also the submachine gun,</v>

2864
02:10:07.290 --> 02:10:10.480
<v Speaker 1>the FBI something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found that a lot easier because it's</v>

2865
02:10:10.481 --> 02:10:14.080
<v Speaker 1>kind of recoil recoil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the guns and I think that would have</v>

2866
02:10:14.081 --> 02:10:15.640
<v Speaker 1>different calibers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>2145.</v>

2867
02:10:15.641 --> 02:10:17.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember the exact numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2868
02:10:17.470 --> 02:10:18.240
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There,</v>

2869
02:10:18.240 --> 02:10:22.210
<v Speaker 1>that's why I have some really powerful</v>
<v Speaker 1>rifles that were even different.</v>

2870
02:10:22.211 --> 02:10:24.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that anything you shot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have some hunting rifles,</v>

2871
02:10:24.461 --> 02:10:27.760
<v Speaker 1>like a 300 win mag that is like getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>punched in the shoulder.</v>

2872
02:10:27.761 --> 02:10:28.594
<v Speaker 1>Every time you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2873
02:10:28.710 --> 02:10:31.000
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shoot it because it's designed to</v>

2874
02:10:31.001 --> 02:10:33.650
<v Speaker 1>shoot Moose and elk and big giant</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>

2875
02:10:33.680 --> 02:10:34.310
<v Speaker 1>It's a heavy</v>

2876
02:10:34.310 --> 02:10:35.840
<v Speaker 4>fee,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really strong,</v>

2877
02:10:35.841 --> 02:10:37.940
<v Speaker 4>powerful round and a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2878
02:10:37.941 --> 02:10:41.180
<v Speaker 4>the vulnerability that you feel when</v>
<v Speaker 4>that trigger goes off and you hear that</v>

2879
02:10:41.181 --> 02:10:43.100
<v Speaker 4>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm sure you're wearing your head</v>

2880
02:10:43.160 --> 02:10:44.450
<v Speaker 4>gear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your guards,</v>

2881
02:10:44.480 --> 02:10:46.190
<v Speaker 4>which you really have to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so important.</v>

2882
02:10:46.490 --> 02:10:50.120
<v Speaker 4>There's so many people out there that</v>
<v Speaker 4>hunt and shoot without ear protection</v>

2883
02:10:50.121 --> 02:10:53.740
<v Speaker 4>and they wind up having tendonitis or</v>
<v Speaker 4>tinnitus and yeah,</v>

2884
02:10:53.810 --> 02:10:56.750
<v Speaker 4>all sorts of issues with their hearing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so bad for you.</v>

2885
02:10:56.810 --> 02:10:57.270
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what he,</v>

2886
02:10:57.270 --> 02:11:02.120
<v Speaker 4>what was interesting is when before we</v>
<v Speaker 4>went and he gave me maybe a 10 15 minute</v>

2887
02:11:02.510 --> 02:11:06.650
<v Speaker 4>safety mini lecture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the main one that he gave,</v>

2888
02:11:06.651 --> 02:11:08.480
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is of course live,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is not,</v>

2889
02:11:08.720 --> 02:11:10.430
<v Speaker 4>these are live bullets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean are lethal.</v>

2890
02:11:10.910 --> 02:11:13.760
<v Speaker 4>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the number one thing you do is when you,</v>

2891
02:11:14.060 --> 02:11:17.570
<v Speaker 4>the gun,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the gun barrel always points to,</v>

2892
02:11:17.600 --> 02:11:18.940
<v Speaker 4>because what happens is he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2893
02:11:18.950 --> 02:11:21.080
<v Speaker 4>people pick it up and start doing yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2894
02:11:21.080 --> 02:11:24.110
<v Speaker 4>Gesture with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so and so to sort of make sure that</v>

2895
02:11:24.111 --> 02:11:26.210
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't commit such an error.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

2896
02:11:26.211 --> 02:11:29.510
<v Speaker 4>here's what we're going to institute as</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do every action.</v>

2897
02:11:29.810 --> 02:11:33.200
<v Speaker 4>I am verbally going to describe it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ah,</v>

2898
02:11:33.201 --> 02:11:36.530
<v Speaker 4>that's smart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that really sort of soften us.</v>

2899
02:11:36.531 --> 02:11:38.810
<v Speaker 4>Why should that the fear?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because then he's listening.</v>

2900
02:11:38.990 --> 02:11:39.823
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not cut.</v>

2901
02:11:39.950 --> 02:11:42.350
<v Speaker 4>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he told me after you shoot,</v>

2902
02:11:42.440 --> 02:11:47.000
<v Speaker 4>take your finger out of the trigger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a trigger discipline.</v>

2903
02:11:47.030 --> 02:11:50.540
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So then I would speak it and by speaking</v>

2904
02:11:50.541 --> 02:11:53.060
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it sort of gave me the discipline to</v>

2905
02:11:53.061 --> 02:11:54.680
<v Speaker 4>never make an error.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But anyways,</v>

2906
02:11:54.681 --> 02:11:56.860
<v Speaker 4>it was a very smart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they should actually teach people to</v>

2907
02:11:56.900 --> 02:11:57.740
<v Speaker 4>think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>

2908
02:11:57.770 --> 02:12:01.160
<v Speaker 4>I think that your method is probably</v>
<v Speaker 4>something that people should adopt as</v>

2909
02:12:01.161 --> 02:12:02.870
<v Speaker 4>very intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know where it comes from,</v>

2910
02:12:02.871 --> 02:12:04.910
<v Speaker 4>actually it comes from some of my</v>
<v Speaker 4>research.</v>

2911
02:12:04.920 --> 02:12:05.660
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>

2912
02:12:05.660 --> 02:12:08.480
<v Speaker 4>there's a methodology called verbal</v>
<v Speaker 4>protocols.</v>

2913
02:12:08.830 --> 02:12:12.440
<v Speaker 4>So what when you're doing research,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could either ask people to fill out</v>

2914
02:12:12.441 --> 02:12:14.540
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's where you're only interested</v>

2915
02:12:14.541 --> 02:12:15.920
<v Speaker 4>in the output,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2916
02:12:16.490 --> 02:12:19.430
<v Speaker 4>Please watch this stimulus and tell me</v>
<v Speaker 4>on a scale what you think,</v>

2917
02:12:19.500 --> 02:12:22.400
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or sometimes I'm interested in the</v>

2918
02:12:22.401 --> 02:12:26.150
<v Speaker 4>process that you're going through as</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're doing something.</v>

2919
02:12:26.480 --> 02:12:29.900
<v Speaker 4>So in that case,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I will have a recorder and I will ask</v>

2920
02:12:29.901 --> 02:12:34.040
<v Speaker 4>for your verbal protocols.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Verbalize what you're doing as you're</v>

2921
02:12:34.041 --> 02:12:37.610
<v Speaker 4>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What that does is it basically yields</v>

2922
02:12:37.850 --> 02:12:39.860
<v Speaker 4>very rich data,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that,</v>

2923
02:12:39.861 --> 02:12:44.861
<v Speaker 4>that is a real bitch to analyze because</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not analyzing numbers on a scale</v>

2924
02:12:44.931 --> 02:12:47.080
<v Speaker 4>of one to seven,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not agonizing,</v>

2925
02:12:47.340 --> 02:12:49.040
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>spikes of testosterone.</v>

2926
02:12:49.041 --> 02:12:53.390
<v Speaker 4>You actually have to go through these</v>
<v Speaker 4>huge transcripts of verbalizations.</v>

2927
02:12:53.420 --> 02:12:56.630
<v Speaker 4>You know what it also does,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it forces you to exist in the conscious</v>

2928
02:12:56.631 --> 02:13:01.160
<v Speaker 4>mind versus the reactive mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You are consciously engaging in a</v>

2929
02:13:01.161 --> 02:13:03.650
<v Speaker 4>process.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like there's a,</v>

2930
02:13:03.651 --> 02:13:05.840
<v Speaker 4>there's a thing called target panic that</v>
<v Speaker 4>many,</v>

2931
02:13:05.900 --> 02:13:08.660
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>archer's a face and a,</v>

2932
02:13:08.661 --> 02:13:12.680
<v Speaker 4>it's a huge issue because of nerves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially people that aren't used to</v>

2933
02:13:12.681 --> 02:13:14.450
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>performing under nerves.</v>

2934
02:13:14.720 --> 02:13:19.720
<v Speaker 4>They go into this really almost like a</v>
<v Speaker 4>tunnel vision sort of estate and they</v>

2935
02:13:21.291 --> 02:13:25.190
<v Speaker 4>start panicking and they just want to</v>
<v Speaker 4>shoot the shot as quick as possible.</v>

2936
02:13:25.340 --> 02:13:27.450
<v Speaker 4>And so they make a lot of errors that</v>
<v Speaker 4>make a lot of,</v>

2937
02:13:27.490 --> 02:13:29.390
<v Speaker 4>cause.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of things involved in</v>

2938
02:13:29.391 --> 02:13:32.090
<v Speaker 4>shooting a bow and Arrow correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bowen arrows.</v>

2939
02:13:32.300 --> 02:13:34.530
<v Speaker 3>It's so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it takes so much more disciplined than</v>

2940
02:13:34.531 --> 02:13:37.110
<v Speaker 3>it does to shoot a rifle because of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>rifle.</v>

2941
02:13:37.260 --> 02:13:40.350
<v Speaker 3>Essentially what you have to do is have</v>
<v Speaker 3>your face in the proper position,</v>

2942
02:13:40.351 --> 02:13:42.070
<v Speaker 3>put your finger on the trigger and</v>
<v Speaker 3>squeeze.</v>

2943
02:13:42.071 --> 02:13:44.610
<v Speaker 3>So the shot goes off almost as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>surprise.</v>

2944
02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:47.130
<v Speaker 3>And if as long as you're looking through</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2945
02:13:47.430 --> 02:13:48.750
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the scope correctly,</v>

2946
02:13:48.751 --> 02:13:51.960
<v Speaker 3>you have your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your rifle centered in or you have a,</v>

2947
02:13:51.961 --> 02:13:53.110
<v Speaker 3>your rifle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2948
02:13:53.190 --> 02:13:56.670
<v Speaker 3>cited incorrectly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it should hit where you want to aim it.</v>

2949
02:13:56.671 --> 02:13:59.430
<v Speaker 3>If the rifle was accurate with a bow and</v>
<v Speaker 3>Arrow,</v>

2950
02:13:59.431 --> 02:14:01.650
<v Speaker 3>there's so many different anchor points.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

2951
02:14:01.651 --> 02:14:03.750
<v Speaker 3>you have to have the string touching the</v>
<v Speaker 3>tip of your nose.</v>

2952
02:14:03.751 --> 02:14:05.970
<v Speaker 3>You have to have your hand the exact</v>
<v Speaker 3>same place every time.</v>

2953
02:14:05.971 --> 02:14:07.800
<v Speaker 3>You have to have practice countless</v>
<v Speaker 3>times.</v>

2954
02:14:08.130 --> 02:14:10.370
<v Speaker 3>You have to make sure that you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>holding your shoulder,</v>

2955
02:14:10.380 --> 02:14:12.480
<v Speaker 3>your front shoulder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the right position in your hand has</v>

2956
02:14:12.481 --> 02:14:15.000
<v Speaker 3>to be holding the bone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a very specific position where you're</v>

2957
02:14:15.001 --> 02:14:16.560
<v Speaker 3>not talking the bowl left and right.</v>

2958
02:14:16.800 --> 02:14:19.290
<v Speaker 3>And so when you go through your shot</v>
<v Speaker 3>process,</v>

2959
02:14:19.740 --> 02:14:24.180
<v Speaker 3>you go through these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this checkpoint in your mind,</v>

2960
02:14:24.240 --> 02:14:28.320
<v Speaker 3>very like I tell when I do it by myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say it,</v>

2961
02:14:28.710 --> 02:14:29.730
<v Speaker 3>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2962
02:14:29.790 --> 02:14:32.250
<v Speaker 3>and the right position,</v>
<v Speaker 3>front shoulder position,</v>

2963
02:14:32.251 --> 02:14:34.560
<v Speaker 3>and say it in your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say it out loud.</v>

2964
02:14:34.561 --> 02:14:35.700
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say it out loud.</v>

2965
02:14:35.701 --> 02:14:38.850
<v Speaker 3>And then when I go through it in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a hunting scenario where obviously</v>

2966
02:14:38.851 --> 02:14:42.390
<v Speaker 3>you have to keep your mouth shut,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go through that same checklist in my</v>

2967
02:14:42.391 --> 02:14:47.391
<v Speaker 3>mind and that sort of in many ways</v>
<v Speaker 3>prevents a lot of the panic because um,</v>

2968
02:14:48.330 --> 02:14:51.450
<v Speaker 3>that sort of panic exists in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>conscious mind.</v>

2969
02:14:51.660 --> 02:14:52.980
<v Speaker 3>You Start Thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

2970
02:14:52.981 --> 02:14:53.850
<v Speaker 3>here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>

2971
02:14:53.851 --> 02:14:55.560
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe it's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't fuck this up.</v>

2972
02:14:55.561 --> 02:14:56.610
<v Speaker 3>Don't fuck this up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>

2973
02:14:56.611 --> 02:15:00.420
<v Speaker 3>you fuck it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's because of this reaction to the</v>

2974
02:15:00.421 --> 02:15:04.650
<v Speaker 3>overwhelming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unusual stimulation of the event,</v>

2975
02:15:04.890 --> 02:15:09.060
<v Speaker 3>of the panic sets in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you succumb to that unusual</v>

2976
02:15:09.061 --> 02:15:09.890
<v Speaker 3>pressure.</v>

2977
02:15:09.890 --> 02:15:12.570
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the portal causes,</v>

2978
02:15:12.610 --> 02:15:16.050
<v Speaker 5>I'm talking about the income of two</v>
<v Speaker 5>varieties is what's called concurrent</v>

2979
02:15:16.051 --> 02:15:21.000
<v Speaker 5>protocols or retro spective protocols.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Concurrent protocols is where you</v>

2980
02:15:21.001 --> 02:15:24.020
<v Speaker 5>verbalize as you're doing the task,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2981
02:15:24.210 --> 02:15:26.190
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the benefit of that is that it's,</v>

2982
02:15:26.250 --> 02:15:27.330
<v Speaker 5>it's live,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

2983
02:15:27.390 --> 02:15:28.730
<v Speaker 5>it's top of mind,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2984
02:15:30.090 --> 02:15:35.090
<v Speaker 5>The downside is that sometimes by asking</v>
<v Speaker 5>a participant to verbalize,</v>

2985
02:15:35.880 --> 02:15:38.880
<v Speaker 5>it actually changes their cognitive</v>
<v Speaker 5>process.</v>

2986
02:15:38.881 --> 02:15:42.300
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So then you might go to retrospective</v>

2987
02:15:42.570 --> 02:15:46.560
<v Speaker 5>protocol,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is now tell me in details how you</v>

2988
02:15:46.561 --> 02:15:49.560
<v Speaker 5>did the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And now the benefit there is that you</v>

2989
02:15:49.561 --> 02:15:50.710
<v Speaker 5>don't have that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2990
02:15:50.910 --> 02:15:51.743
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2991
02:15:51.750 --> 02:15:54.270
<v Speaker 5>interference.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the downside of course,</v>

2992
02:15:54.300 --> 02:15:57.390
<v Speaker 5>is that you have memory loss.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't remember the specifics.</v>

2993
02:15:57.630 --> 02:16:00.450
<v Speaker 5>Or you also have people who fill in</v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff.</v>

2994
02:16:00.451 --> 02:16:01.284
<v Speaker 5>That's bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2995
02:16:01.730 --> 02:16:04.530
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>now the guy wants me to justify how I</v>

2996
02:16:04.531 --> 02:16:07.170
<v Speaker 5>went and did it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now let me just fill in stuff.</v>

2997
02:16:07.200 --> 02:16:10.500
<v Speaker 5>But that's not really what I did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So as is true in most of these</v>

2998
02:16:10.501 --> 02:16:13.500
<v Speaker 5>methodological choices,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you're making these scientific</v>

2999
02:16:13.501 --> 02:16:17.070
<v Speaker 5>decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there is no absolute optimal strategy.</v>

3000
02:16:17.071 --> 02:16:20.310
<v Speaker 5>There's always pros and cons to any</v>
<v Speaker 5>methodology you use.</v>

3001
02:16:20.700 --> 02:16:22.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think there's also something that</v>

3002
02:16:22.621 --> 02:16:26.020
<v Speaker 3>happens to people when they do something</v>
<v Speaker 3>so many times where it becomes a</v>

3003
02:16:26.021 --> 02:16:27.520
<v Speaker 3>subconscious action.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3004
02:16:27.630 --> 02:16:30.400
<v Speaker 3>And then when you ask him to verbalize</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the steps are,</v>

3005
02:16:30.610 --> 02:16:33.850
<v Speaker 3>oftentimes they don't know because</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've programmed it into their mind</v>

3006
02:16:33.851 --> 02:16:37.270
<v Speaker 3>like electricity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I asked you to describe in exact</v>

3007
02:16:37.271 --> 02:16:39.910
<v Speaker 3>detail what is the process that you tie</v>
<v Speaker 3>your shoes with?</v>

3008
02:16:40.090 --> 02:16:41.920
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like which hand goes first,</v>

3009
02:16:41.921 --> 02:16:44.080
<v Speaker 3>which finger goes under,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you'd be like,</v>

3010
02:16:44.110 --> 02:16:45.670
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do I do it?</v>

3011
02:16:45.700 --> 02:16:48.340
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I take the,</v>

3012
02:16:48.370 --> 02:16:50.240
<v Speaker 3>but when you tie your shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just go,</v>

3013
02:16:50.460 --> 02:16:51.630
<v Speaker 3>Bro,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoops.</v>

3014
02:16:52.150 --> 02:16:52.983
<v Speaker 3>Caught it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3015
02:16:53.100 --> 02:16:55.570
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just go through this storm standard</v>

3016
02:16:55.571 --> 02:16:57.400
<v Speaker 3>process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If that happens with martial artists a</v>

3017
02:16:57.401 --> 02:16:59.230
<v Speaker 3>lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of martial artists that</v>

3018
02:16:59.231 --> 02:17:01.960
<v Speaker 3>have certain techniques that they've</v>
<v Speaker 3>gotten down to a science.</v>

3019
02:17:02.110 --> 02:17:04.240
<v Speaker 3>But then when you ask them to teach it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you say,</v>

3020
02:17:04.241 --> 02:17:05.650
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing first?</v>

3021
02:17:05.650 --> 02:17:06.910
<v Speaker 3>Are you doing this first shot?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they go,</v>

3022
02:17:06.911 --> 02:17:07.940
<v Speaker 3>Huh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3023
02:17:07.960 --> 02:17:10.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they literally don't know.</v>

3024
02:17:10.570 --> 02:17:12.910
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've talked to that with certain archers</v>

3025
02:17:12.911 --> 02:17:14.980
<v Speaker 3>to certain artists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've asked them,</v>

3026
02:17:15.250 --> 02:17:19.480
<v Speaker 3>are you looking at the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the site first or are you looking at the</v>

3027
02:17:19.481 --> 02:17:21.910
<v Speaker 3>target first?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know when you released the Arrow,</v>

3028
02:17:21.920 --> 02:17:23.290
<v Speaker 3>are you looking at the target or the</v>
<v Speaker 3>site?</v>

3029
02:17:23.740 --> 02:17:26.710
<v Speaker 3>They don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't know where it falls into this</v>

3030
02:17:26.711 --> 02:17:29.890
<v Speaker 3>sort of subconscious state where they've</v>
<v Speaker 3>made repetition.</v>

3031
02:17:30.250 --> 02:17:32.680
<v Speaker 3>So they've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've repeated the process so many</v>

3032
02:17:32.681 --> 02:17:36.550
<v Speaker 3>times they've made this repetition</v>
<v Speaker 3>cemented in their subconscious where</v>

3033
02:17:36.551 --> 02:17:38.950
<v Speaker 3>they could just just sort of go into</v>
<v Speaker 3>this Zombie state.</v>

3034
02:17:39.230 --> 02:17:39.831
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's funny,</v>

3035
02:17:39.831 --> 02:17:43.010
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I felt that recently trying to play</v>

3036
02:17:43.190 --> 02:17:45.520
<v Speaker 5>pickup soccer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ah,</v>

3037
02:17:46.150 --> 02:17:49.130
<v Speaker 5>it's going to speak to that authenticity</v>
<v Speaker 5>and exactly how you're saying.</v>

3038
02:17:49.400 --> 02:17:52.250
<v Speaker 5>So when I was a young guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>young player who can,</v>

3039
02:17:52.280 --> 02:17:54.830
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>accelerate past players as if it's</v>

3040
02:17:54.831 --> 02:17:56.810
<v Speaker 5>nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a natural thing.</v>

3041
02:17:56.870 --> 02:17:59.870
<v Speaker 5>I don't think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My Body reacts and if you asked me to</v>

3042
02:17:59.871 --> 02:18:04.280
<v Speaker 5>tell you how I shifted left and right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't tell you now is a much older</v>

3043
02:18:04.281 --> 02:18:07.910
<v Speaker 5>and much heavier.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those moves that I tried to do,</v>

3044
02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:13.000
<v Speaker 5>I no longer had the automatic ability.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So actually my brain was trying to</v>

3045
02:18:13.341 --> 02:18:14.180
<v Speaker 5>think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

3046
02:18:14.181 --> 02:18:17.570
<v Speaker 5>I better turn right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but be careful because my knee is a bit</v>

3047
02:18:17.571 --> 02:18:21.680
<v Speaker 5>weak.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so I actually felt the difference</v>

3048
02:18:22.010 --> 02:18:24.670
<v Speaker 5>and the automaticity response,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ah,</v>

3049
02:18:24.710 --> 02:18:27.830
<v Speaker 5>if only by virtue of being much older</v>
<v Speaker 5>and much heavier.</v>

3050
02:18:27.920 --> 02:18:29.510
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there you go.</v>

3051
02:18:29.511 --> 02:18:33.590
<v Speaker 5>20 years ago I could have probably not</v>
<v Speaker 5>been able to tell you how I did this</v>

3052
02:18:33.650 --> 02:18:35.750
<v Speaker 5>today.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I could tell you how I did it because it</v>

3053
02:18:35.751 --> 02:18:38.200
<v Speaker 5>was a slow as a turtle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ah,</v>

3054
02:18:38.210 --> 02:18:39.043
<v Speaker 5>that's funny.</v>

3055
02:18:39.260 --> 02:18:40.590
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that exists in a,</v>

3056
02:18:40.591 --> 02:18:44.060
<v Speaker 3>in fighting for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You drill these moments over and over</v>

3057
02:18:44.061 --> 02:18:46.220
<v Speaker 3>into your mind so that when you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting,</v>

3058
02:18:46.221 --> 02:18:48.920
<v Speaker 3>they actually just come out</v>
<v Speaker 3>subconsciously or they come out without</v>

3059
02:18:48.921 --> 02:18:52.100
<v Speaker 3>conscious thought because you don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>really have the time to say,</v>

3060
02:18:52.310 --> 02:18:54.800
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to slip this right hand and</v>

3061
02:18:54.801 --> 02:18:56.140
<v Speaker 3>throw the left to the body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

3062
02:18:56.210 --> 02:18:57.440
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the right high kick.</v>

3063
02:18:57.441 --> 02:19:00.170
<v Speaker 3>It has to sort of be an automatic</v>
<v Speaker 3>response,</v>

3064
02:19:00.190 --> 02:19:01.940
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you have to be able to go into this</v>

3065
02:19:01.941 --> 02:19:06.860
<v Speaker 3>zen state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is fine in these big movements.</v>

3066
02:19:06.861 --> 02:19:09.230
<v Speaker 3>He's explosive movements like a martial</v>
<v Speaker 3>arts thing.</v>

3067
02:19:09.410 --> 02:19:12.950
<v Speaker 3>But in terms of like an archery thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't want fast,</v>

3068
02:19:12.951 --> 02:19:16.010
<v Speaker 3>big twitching,</v>
<v Speaker 3>explosive movements to come out</v>

3069
02:19:16.011 --> 02:19:18.710
<v Speaker 3>automatically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you want is a very controlled</v>

3070
02:19:18.711 --> 02:19:22.550
<v Speaker 3>process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Will you maintain very strict form and</v>

3071
02:19:22.551 --> 02:19:25.730
<v Speaker 3>you stay calm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so when that sort of a process going</v>

3072
02:19:25.731 --> 02:19:29.990
<v Speaker 3>over this conscious shot making process</v>
<v Speaker 3>is probably better for you.</v>

3073
02:19:30.080 --> 02:19:30.913
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>

3074
02:19:30.920 --> 02:19:32.810
<v Speaker 3>Are you still fighting?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

3075
02:19:32.840 --> 02:19:34.910
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's really not good for,</v>

3076
02:19:34.911 --> 02:19:36.990
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even as a spotter,</v>

3077
02:19:37.670 --> 02:19:39.420
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu only,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3078
02:19:39.430 --> 02:19:41.240
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I haven't done that in over a year.</v>

3079
02:19:41.270 --> 02:19:43.220
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's just because of a back injury</v>

3080
02:19:43.221 --> 02:19:45.710
<v Speaker 3>that I've been dealing with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's pretty much gone now.</v>

3081
02:19:45.890 --> 02:19:48.350
<v Speaker 3>But sparring as far as like kickboxing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sparring,</v>

3082
02:19:48.380 --> 02:19:50.120
<v Speaker 3>I gave that up many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many years ago.</v>

3083
02:19:50.480 --> 02:19:53.800
<v Speaker 3>It's just even sparring for fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even just a,</v>

3084
02:19:53.980 --> 02:19:57.920
<v Speaker 3>even you have to like really be sure of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the person you're doing it with because</v>

3085
02:19:57.921 --> 02:20:02.120
<v Speaker 3>every single time you get tagged,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you looked at your body or your brain</v>

3086
02:20:02.121 --> 02:20:03.660
<v Speaker 3>rather as um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3087
02:20:03.670 --> 02:20:06.230
<v Speaker 3>a punch card,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like say you have a hundred holes to</v>

3088
02:20:06.231 --> 02:20:08.300
<v Speaker 3>punch and once you punch through those</v>
<v Speaker 3>hundred holes,</v>

3089
02:20:08.630 --> 02:20:09.720
<v Speaker 3>you're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3090
02:20:09.800 --> 02:20:11.360
<v Speaker 3>And you might get away with a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 3>holes.</v>

3091
02:20:11.361 --> 02:20:15.380
<v Speaker 3>You might get away with three or four or</v>
<v Speaker 3>five or 10 or 20.</v>

3092
02:20:15.590 --> 02:20:17.120
<v Speaker 3>This is the whole nfl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3093
02:20:17.160 --> 02:20:19.100
<v Speaker 3>it had been 100%,</v>
<v Speaker 3>100% and,</v>

3094
02:20:19.430 --> 02:20:22.670
<v Speaker 3>but it pertains to a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And even soccer players would the head,</v>

3095
02:20:22.760 --> 02:20:24.140
<v Speaker 3>the heading,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is insane,</v>

3096
02:20:24.190 --> 02:20:26.420
<v Speaker 3>you would never meet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine like for years,</v>

3097
02:20:26.421 --> 02:20:27.380
<v Speaker 3>for decades,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rather,</v>

3098
02:20:27.590 --> 02:20:31.010
<v Speaker 3>we had no idea that heading a ball could</v>
<v Speaker 3>have detrimental effects.</v>

3099
02:20:31.250 --> 02:20:35.000
<v Speaker 3>But now we're finding out that certain</v>
<v Speaker 3>soccer players who consistently headed</v>

3100
02:20:35.001 --> 02:20:40.001
<v Speaker 3>the ball over a long career develop all</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorts of cognitive issues with memory,</v>

3101
02:20:40.370 --> 02:20:42.980
<v Speaker 3>impulsiveness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the same sort of symptoms that I</v>

3102
02:20:42.981 --> 02:20:44.690
<v Speaker 3>find from fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Incredible.</v>

3103
02:20:44.810 --> 02:20:46.850
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing because it's not a</v>
<v Speaker 3>concussion thing.</v>

3104
02:20:47.090 --> 02:20:50.690
<v Speaker 3>It's a sub concussive trauma thing where</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're constantly engaging that</v>

3105
02:20:50.870 --> 02:20:54.560
<v Speaker 3>connective tissue inside your brain to</v>
<v Speaker 3>try to stabilize the brain.</v>

3106
02:20:54.561 --> 02:20:58.360
<v Speaker 3>Is it swashes around inside your skull</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it starts failing and then the,</v>

3107
02:20:58.361 --> 02:21:01.970
<v Speaker 3>the damage of your brain moving around</v>
<v Speaker 3>inside of there starts accumulating.</v>

3108
02:21:02.120 --> 02:21:06.500
<v Speaker 3>Speaking of soccer and your mma stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm triggered by,</v>

3150
02:22:45.451 --> 02:22:46.650
<v Speaker 4>you're older than me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He called me son.</v>

3151
02:22:46.651 --> 02:22:48.930
<v Speaker 4>Remember you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not 50 yet.</v>

02:22:48.931 --> 02:22:49.561
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3153

<v Speaker 4>49 just turned.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

3154
02:22:51.450 --> 02:22:53.130
<v Speaker 4>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Happy Birthday.</v>

3155
02:22:53.220 --> 02:22:56.100
<v Speaker 4>The slide is real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm 51 so I'm already,</v>

3156
02:22:56.280 --> 02:22:58.950
<v Speaker 4>I'm on the downside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when it makes it even more difficult</v>

3157
02:22:58.951 --> 02:23:00.810
<v Speaker 4>to lose weight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're more set in your ways.</v>

3158
02:23:00.811 --> 02:23:05.811
<v Speaker 4>Your hormone system starts Sulu and</v>
<v Speaker 4>does your metabolism slowing down?</v>

3159
02:23:08.890 --> 02:23:09.900
<v Speaker 4>We've got to ramp it up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>buddy.</v>

3160
02:23:09.930 --> 02:23:11.580
<v Speaker 4>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got to start off your day with</v>

3161
02:23:11.581 --> 02:23:12.990
<v Speaker 4>exercise too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So are you,</v>

3162
02:23:13.080 --> 02:23:16.910
<v Speaker 4>are you currently at the same weight as</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would have been 20 years ago or no,</v>

3163
02:23:16.920 --> 02:23:19.950
<v Speaker 4>I'm heavier but more muscle because I've</v>
<v Speaker 4>been lifting weights with the last,</v>

3164
02:23:19.980 --> 02:23:22.140
<v Speaker 4>when I got into Jujitsu like really</v>
<v Speaker 4>heavily,</v>

3165
02:23:22.560 --> 02:23:27.560
<v Speaker 4>which was about 2000 right around the</v>
<v Speaker 4>year 2000 I started training in 96 but I</v>

3166
02:23:29.911 --> 02:23:34.911
<v Speaker 4>got really into it around 2000 so over</v>
<v Speaker 4>the last 16 plus years I've been lifting</v>

3167
02:23:36.001 --> 02:23:38.220
<v Speaker 4>way more weights,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like are really good in the lifting</v>

3168
02:23:38.221 --> 02:23:42.300
<v Speaker 4>weights because I realized how</v>
<v Speaker 4>significant it is a factor and also to</v>

3169
02:23:42.301 --> 02:23:44.490
<v Speaker 4>protect your joints.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a big factor too.</v>

3170
02:23:44.970 --> 02:23:46.850
<v Speaker 4>Just the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ability to uh,</v>

3171
02:23:47.370 --> 02:23:49.470
<v Speaker 4>defend yourself better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3172
02:23:49.471 --> 02:23:51.810
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do a lot of long endurance,</v>

3173
02:23:51.830 --> 02:23:53.310
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an hour cardio,</v>

3174
02:23:53.700 --> 02:23:56.210
<v Speaker 4>but I've always been terrible a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 4>ways.</v>

3175
02:23:56.760 --> 02:23:59.730
<v Speaker 4>How often do you do self tape?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been here for a month in</v>

3176
02:23:59.731 --> 02:24:01.350
<v Speaker 4>California,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so 30 days.</v>

3177
02:24:01.380 --> 02:24:03.210
<v Speaker 4>I probably did have 24 days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

3178
02:24:03.240 --> 02:24:04.380
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's amazing.</v>

3179
02:24:04.381 --> 02:24:05.490
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you do afterwards?</v>

3180
02:24:05.491 --> 02:24:07.750
<v Speaker 4>Just so I'll usually do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3181
02:24:07.800 --> 02:24:10.620
<v Speaker 4>an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 4>either treadmill or bike or a</v>

3182
02:24:10.621 --> 02:24:12.420
<v Speaker 4>combination,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes elliptical.</v>

3183
02:24:12.421 --> 02:24:14.400
<v Speaker 4>So these three are usually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what time do you do it?</v>

3184
02:24:14.401 --> 02:24:15.620
<v Speaker 4>Do you do in the morning and going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3185
02:24:15.621 --> 02:24:16.291
<v Speaker 4>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In the morning,</v>

3186
02:24:16.291 --> 02:24:17.890
<v Speaker 4>but not very early.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe say.</v>

3187
02:24:18.080 --> 02:24:19.650
<v Speaker 4>And you do an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do an hour.</v>

3188
02:24:19.680 --> 02:24:20.700
<v Speaker 4>That's a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

3189
02:24:20.760 --> 02:24:22.860
<v Speaker 4>That's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's cause I was coming on your show.</v>

3190
02:24:23.240 --> 02:24:24.330
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>

3191
02:24:24.390 --> 02:24:28.830
<v Speaker 4>I usually do about an hour and now here</v>
<v Speaker 4>in California I've tried to incorporate</v>

3192
02:24:28.860 --> 02:24:33.180
<v Speaker 4>weight training usually back home.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't as I understand that I need to</v>

3193
02:24:33.181 --> 02:24:36.300
<v Speaker 4>do it more so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well I would say that weight training</v>

3194
02:24:36.301 --> 02:24:38.790
<v Speaker 4>definitely makes your body burn more</v>
<v Speaker 4>calories,</v>

3195
02:24:38.850 --> 02:24:39.683
<v Speaker 4>that's for sure.</v>

3196
02:24:39.720 --> 02:24:41.490
<v Speaker 4>And two for two reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One,</v>

3197
02:24:41.491 --> 02:24:45.900
<v Speaker 4>because when you put on more muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your body has more requirements for for</v>

3198
02:24:45.901 --> 02:24:48.210
<v Speaker 4>calories,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's easier for your body to burn</v>

3199
02:24:48.211 --> 02:24:51.990
<v Speaker 4>more fuel if you have more muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The act of lifting weights is very</v>

3200
02:24:51.991 --> 02:24:55.980
<v Speaker 4>strenuous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>burns a lot of calories and a it also,</v>

3201
02:24:55.981 --> 02:24:58.050
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just really good for your endocrine</v>

3202
02:24:58.051 --> 02:25:01.320
<v Speaker 4>system when you start lifting weights,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially if you do things like</v>

3203
02:25:01.321 --> 02:25:03.750
<v Speaker 4>deadlifts or squats.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't do any of that stuff cause I</v>

3204
02:25:03.751 --> 02:25:05.670
<v Speaker 4>have three herniated disks in my back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You do,</v>

3205
02:25:06.470 --> 02:25:11.340
<v Speaker 4>so I'll try with your back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's going not actually about 2005 we</v>

3206
02:25:11.341 --> 02:25:16.341
<v Speaker 4>were moving from one house to another.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've got a huge library books and I'm</v>

3207
02:25:16.950 --> 02:25:18.690
<v Speaker 4>going to say this will become evident in</v>
<v Speaker 4>a second.</v>

3208
02:25:19.020 --> 02:25:23.680
<v Speaker 4>As you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>book boxes are deceptive and that they</v>

3209
02:25:23.681 --> 02:25:24.250
<v Speaker 4>look like</v>

3210
02:25:24.250 --> 02:25:26.680
<v Speaker 3>they're small volume but they are</v>
<v Speaker 3>extremely heavy.</v>

3211
02:25:27.100 --> 02:25:29.860
<v Speaker 3>I went to pick one up and I did the</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong emotion.</v>

3212
02:25:29.950 --> 02:25:34.090
<v Speaker 3>I felt my back and then after that it</v>
<v Speaker 3>would just flare up maybe once a year</v>

3213
02:25:34.450 --> 02:25:38.800
<v Speaker 3>and about four years ago I went down to</v>
<v Speaker 3>bend down and then I was basically</v>

3214
02:25:38.801 --> 02:25:42.490
<v Speaker 3>immobilized for what part of your back?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the left side through your lower</v>

3215
02:25:42.491 --> 02:25:43.740
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Back there.</v>

3216
02:25:43.750 --> 02:25:46.540
<v Speaker 3>Three herniated this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I went to see a physiatrist and</v>

3217
02:25:46.541 --> 02:25:48.940
<v Speaker 3>here's his advice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never bend again.</v>

3218
02:25:49.480 --> 02:25:52.240
<v Speaker 3>Well those people are dipshits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so many doctors.</v>

3219
02:25:52.241 --> 02:25:53.920
<v Speaker 3>It'll tell you don't do this and don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>do that.</v>

3220
02:25:53.921 --> 02:25:58.921
<v Speaker 3>I went to a doctor in 2002 because I had</v>
<v Speaker 3>a torn meniscus,</v>

3221
02:25:59.110 --> 02:26:01.450
<v Speaker 3>just a torn meniscus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really simple injury for someone as a</v>

3222
02:26:01.451 --> 02:26:06.451
<v Speaker 3>martial artist and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they told me to stop doing martial arts.</v>

3223
02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:08.740
<v Speaker 3>They literally told me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be a cripple if you</v>

3224
02:26:08.741 --> 02:26:08.950
<v Speaker 3>start.</v>

3225
02:26:08.950 --> 02:26:10.900
<v Speaker 3>You don't stop doing martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3226
02:26:10.901 --> 02:26:11.734
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

3227
02:26:11.800 --> 02:26:14.260
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kind of stupid advices that I'm like,</v>

3228
02:26:14.261 --> 02:26:16.560
<v Speaker 3>just scope this God damn thing and let</v>
<v Speaker 3>me get outta here.</v>

3229
02:26:16.580 --> 02:26:18.790
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got back on [inaudible] and</v>

3230
02:26:18.820 --> 02:26:23.320
<v Speaker 3>glucosamine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I ate a lot of fish oil and I've had no</v>

3231
02:26:23.321 --> 02:26:27.010
<v Speaker 3>problem with that knee since then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they scoped out a chunk of</v>

3232
02:26:27.011 --> 02:26:29.440
<v Speaker 3>Meniscus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is really common with people that</v>

3233
02:26:29.441 --> 02:26:32.650
<v Speaker 3>have extreme athletic pursuits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's soccer,</v>

3234
02:26:32.651 --> 02:26:34.080
<v Speaker 3>soccer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>La guys are cheering,</v>

3235
02:26:34.150 --> 02:26:35.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>martial arts.</v>

3236
02:26:35.471 --> 02:26:36.221
<v Speaker 3>It's a big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3237
02:26:36.221 --> 02:26:40.480
<v Speaker 3>it's normal thing that they do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But to have this asshole tell me to stop</v>

3238
02:26:40.481 --> 02:26:42.010
<v Speaker 3>doing martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be cripple.</v>

3239
02:26:42.220 --> 02:26:43.750
<v Speaker 3>I've just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just wanted to just say,</v>

3240
02:26:43.751 --> 02:26:45.280
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a fucking asshole.</v>

3241
02:26:45.281 --> 02:26:48.490
<v Speaker 3>Like you really have no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no qualifications to be saying this.</v>

3242
02:26:48.500 --> 02:26:50.740
<v Speaker 3>Like this is foolish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're fixed injuries.</v>

3243
02:26:50.741 --> 02:26:55.741
<v Speaker 3>You can't tell me that if I don't listen</v>
<v Speaker 3>to your stupid lazy advice.</v>

3244
02:26:56.500 --> 02:26:58.800
<v Speaker 3>It's just such a dumb thing to say to</v>
<v Speaker 3>people be,</v>

3245
02:26:58.870 --> 02:27:01.090
<v Speaker 3>especially when you're talking about a</v>
<v Speaker 3>meniscus injury,</v>

3246
02:27:01.240 --> 02:27:04.810
<v Speaker 3>you're not talking about a severe spinal</v>
<v Speaker 3>injury where someone could become</v>

3247
02:27:04.811 --> 02:27:07.420
<v Speaker 3>paralyzed if they continue the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing that they're doing.</v>

3248
02:27:07.660 --> 02:27:09.340
<v Speaker 3>Now you're talking about a meniscus</v>
<v Speaker 3>tear,</v>

3249
02:27:09.430 --> 02:27:10.480
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really simple.</v>

3250
02:27:10.510 --> 02:27:12.370
<v Speaker 3>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have artificial meniscus now,</v>

3251
02:27:12.371 --> 02:27:15.550
<v Speaker 3>now they do stem cells that actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>regenerate meniscus.</v>

3252
02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:17.890
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stem cell research is another one that</v>

3253
02:27:17.891 --> 02:27:19.440
<v Speaker 3>those forbidden knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3254
02:27:19.600 --> 02:27:23.980
<v Speaker 3>topics because of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well it was way more now because they</v>

3255
02:27:23.981 --> 02:27:26.470
<v Speaker 3>found so many different methods of</v>
<v Speaker 3>acquiring stem cells.</v>

3256
02:27:26.471 --> 02:27:28.460
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but during the Bush administration,</v>

3257
02:27:28.461 --> 02:27:31.420
<v Speaker 3>I was hugely problematic and that's one</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the reasons why Europe got so far</v>

3258
02:27:31.421 --> 02:27:32.440
<v Speaker 3>ahead of America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>

3259
02:27:32.830 --> 02:27:34.220
<v Speaker 3>And there's a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3260
02:27:34.360 --> 02:27:36.550
<v Speaker 3>people that go to get certain</v>
<v Speaker 3>treatments.</v>

3261
02:27:36.551 --> 02:27:37.250
<v Speaker 3>They got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

3262
02:27:37.250 --> 02:27:38.890
<v Speaker 3>they had to go to other countries.</v>

3263
02:27:39.130 --> 02:27:44.050
<v Speaker 3>Fortunately now there's a lot of stem</v>
<v Speaker 3>cell doctors and specialists that are in</v>

3264
02:27:44.070 --> 02:27:47.410
<v Speaker 3>United States that are having incredible</v>
<v Speaker 3>success with injuries.</v>

3265
02:27:47.411 --> 02:27:49.090
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of mixed martial artists do it</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

3266
02:27:49.550 --> 02:27:51.400
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Demetrius mighty mouse Johnson is the</v>

3267
02:27:51.401 --> 02:27:52.810
<v Speaker 3>best pound for pound fighter in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

3268
02:27:52.811 --> 02:27:54.910
<v Speaker 3>Just had some stem cells shot into his</v>
<v Speaker 3>knee.</v>

3269
02:27:55.590 --> 02:27:56.570
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's,</v>

3270
02:27:56.590 --> 02:27:59.160
<v Speaker 3>this is a really common thing that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

3271
02:27:59.161 --> 02:28:01.600
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you deal with some doctors who aren't</v>

3272
02:28:01.601 --> 02:28:04.120
<v Speaker 3>athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't work with athletes and then they</v>

3273
02:28:04.121 --> 02:28:06.160
<v Speaker 3>tell you things like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't ever lift something again.</v>

3274
02:28:06.460 --> 02:28:10.060
<v Speaker 3>That is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is a crazy piece of conceivable.</v>

3275
02:28:10.180 --> 02:28:11.620
<v Speaker 3>100%.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3276
02:28:11.621 --> 02:28:13.450
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to show you a machine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When we get off today,</v>

3277
02:28:13.451 --> 02:28:14.500
<v Speaker 3>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll show you in a couple of minutes</v>

3278
02:28:14.501 --> 02:28:16.630
<v Speaker 3>because we're gonna end soon where</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a machine that I have in the</v>

3279
02:28:16.631 --> 02:28:19.350
<v Speaker 3>back called the reverse hyper and it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>created by this guy.</v>

3280
02:28:19.390 --> 02:28:21.800
<v Speaker 3>I've talked about this so many times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people like not again,</v>

3281
02:28:22.130 --> 02:28:24.050
<v Speaker 3>but it's created by this guy named Louie</v>
<v Speaker 3>Simmons.</v>

3282
02:28:24.050 --> 02:28:28.460
<v Speaker 3>And Louie Simmons is this guy who runs</v>
<v Speaker 3>this very famous powerlifting gym called</v>

3283
02:28:28.461 --> 02:28:32.420
<v Speaker 3>Westside Barbell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he had a bulging disc himself and</v>

3284
02:28:32.421 --> 02:28:35.150
<v Speaker 3>his doctors are telling them they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to have to fuse your disc and you</v>

3285
02:28:35.151 --> 02:28:36.380
<v Speaker 3>know you're going to have to have an</v>
<v Speaker 3>operation.</v>

3286
02:28:36.390 --> 02:28:37.223
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

3287
02:28:37.670 --> 02:28:40.640
<v Speaker 3>And he couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a person who is an expert in</v>

3288
02:28:40.641 --> 02:28:42.880
<v Speaker 3>physiology and a person who is an expert</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a,</v>

3289
02:28:42.881 --> 02:28:45.680
<v Speaker 3>in exercise and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and teaching people how to get strong,</v>

3290
02:28:45.860 --> 02:28:50.860
<v Speaker 3>he couldn't understand why if an injury,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a compression of the disc,</v>

3291
02:28:51.081 --> 02:28:54.920
<v Speaker 3>cause the disc to herniate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why couldn't a decompression of the disk</v>

3292
02:28:54.950 --> 02:28:58.880
<v Speaker 3>cause it to reset or to heal?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he developed this machine that does</v>

3293
02:28:58.881 --> 02:29:01.070
<v Speaker 3>exactly that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called the reverse hyper.</v>

3294
02:29:01.280 --> 02:29:04.760
<v Speaker 3>And I have one of these in the back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you see when he's lifting the weights</v>

3295
02:29:04.880 --> 02:29:06.530
<v Speaker 3>up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's strengthening the back.</v>

3296
02:29:06.531 --> 02:29:10.970
<v Speaker 3>When the weights go down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's actually pulling the back apart.</v>

3297
02:29:11.240 --> 02:29:15.140
<v Speaker 3>It's slowly decompressing the back in an</v>
<v Speaker 3>active form.</v>

3298
02:29:15.230 --> 02:29:17.720
<v Speaker 3>But has there been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have there been any studies that show</v>

3299
02:29:17.721 --> 02:29:20.190
<v Speaker 3>that if you use this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your herniated disc</v>

3300
02:29:21.810 --> 02:29:25.340
<v Speaker 3>he himself has done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean no peer reviewed studies,</v>

3301
02:29:25.341 --> 02:29:30.260
<v Speaker 3>but athletes have used this time and</v>
<v Speaker 3>time again along with decompression.</v>

3302
02:29:30.261 --> 02:29:32.600
<v Speaker 3>Spinal decompression is also really</v>
<v Speaker 3>important.</v>

3303
02:29:32.840 --> 02:29:35.840
<v Speaker 3>Spinal decompression meaning like</v>
<v Speaker 3>hanging from your ankles,</v>

3304
02:29:35.841 --> 02:29:38.060
<v Speaker 3>hanging from your waist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a couple of different devices in</v>

3305
02:29:38.061 --> 02:29:42.230
<v Speaker 3>the back that I can show you that allow</v>
<v Speaker 3>you to relax your back and yoga is also</v>

3306
02:29:42.231 --> 02:29:44.630
<v Speaker 3>critical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yoga is huge because there's a bunch of</v>

3307
02:29:44.631 --> 02:29:49.130
<v Speaker 3>positions in yoga where you are actively</v>
<v Speaker 3>decompressing your back.</v>

3308
02:29:49.160 --> 02:29:52.730
<v Speaker 3>There's one where you reach back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you grab yourself behind the heels,</v>

3309
02:29:52.940 --> 02:29:56.900
<v Speaker 3>you straighten your legs out and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>literally are pulling with your arms and</v>

3310
02:29:56.901 --> 02:29:58.670
<v Speaker 3>you feel your back all like pop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pop,</v>

3311
02:29:58.671 --> 02:30:01.970
<v Speaker 3>pop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're releasing tension and pressure</v>

3312
02:30:01.971 --> 02:30:03.680
<v Speaker 3>and you're actively stretching your</v>
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>

3313
02:30:03.740 --> 02:30:07.760
<v Speaker 3>So I'm walking out of here invigorated</v>
<v Speaker 3>by our chat and filled with hope and</v>

3314
02:30:07.761 --> 02:30:09.900
<v Speaker 3>optimism about diet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exercise size.</v>

3315
02:30:10.070 --> 02:30:10.551
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>

3316
02:30:10.551 --> 02:30:12.080
<v Speaker 3>nothing my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>

3317
02:30:12.081 --> 02:30:14.660
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really important for people to work</v>

3318
02:30:14.661 --> 02:30:17.330
<v Speaker 3>on their core and their spine and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so many people that don't.</v>

3319
02:30:17.360 --> 02:30:19.040
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend of mine was just big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>strong,</v>

3320
02:30:19.041 --> 02:30:21.050
<v Speaker 3>powerful guy and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3321
02:30:21.051 --> 02:30:24.590
<v Speaker 3>he played football and he's done a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 3>of different things but he's never done</v>

3322
02:30:24.591 --> 02:30:29.210
<v Speaker 3>any like real significant core work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I started showing him some different</v>

3323
02:30:29.211 --> 02:30:32.870
<v Speaker 3>exercises like windmills and things</v>
<v Speaker 3>along those lines and he was stunned at</v>

3324
02:30:32.871 --> 02:30:37.130
<v Speaker 3>how weak his lower back is because so</v>
<v Speaker 3>many people don't work those muscles.</v>

3325
02:30:37.131 --> 02:30:39.590
<v Speaker 3>And those muscles are critical for</v>
<v Speaker 3>athletic performance,</v>

3326
02:30:39.591 --> 02:30:43.760
<v Speaker 3>for your ability to move and to protect</v>
<v Speaker 3>your spine from injury.</v>

3327
02:30:43.761 --> 02:30:47.870
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of injuries that you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>avoid by just being strong in your core</v>

3328
02:30:47.871 --> 02:30:50.960
<v Speaker 3>and your column,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your spinal column and d developing</v>

3329
02:30:50.961 --> 02:30:53.330
<v Speaker 3>strength around the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3330
02:30:53.360 --> 02:30:56.900
<v Speaker 3>that whole really super sensitive and</v>
<v Speaker 3>delicate area of your back.</v>

3331
02:30:57.650 --> 02:30:59.720
<v Speaker 3>But decompression is real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3332
02:30:59.750 --> 02:31:01.820
<v Speaker 3>there's a bunch of machines that doctors</v>
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>

3333
02:31:01.821 --> 02:31:03.160
<v Speaker 3>and when I hurt my neck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3334
02:31:03.200 --> 02:31:05.570
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that I did is went to</v>
<v Speaker 3>this doctor that would,</v>

3335
02:31:05.630 --> 02:31:07.850
<v Speaker 3>they would have this machine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It kind of straps you in.</v>

3336
02:31:07.880 --> 02:31:10.370
<v Speaker 3>It just gives you this gentle poles and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of like,</v>

3337
02:31:10.371 --> 02:31:12.470
<v Speaker 3>what about the upside down world?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have the one of those two.</v>

3338
02:31:12.640 --> 02:31:13.473
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are good.</v>

3339
02:31:13.520 --> 02:31:14.480
<v Speaker 3>Those are good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are good.</v>

3340
02:31:14.481 --> 02:31:16.580
<v Speaker 3>But you have to learn how to really</v>
<v Speaker 3>relax your back.</v>

3341
02:31:16.610 --> 02:31:18.350
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they hang by their angles,</v>

3342
02:31:18.351 --> 02:31:20.760
<v Speaker 3>they tend to up and it sort of defeats</v>
<v Speaker 3>the purpose,</v>

3343
02:31:20.790 --> 02:31:21.950
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to learn it,</v>

3344
02:31:23.340 --> 02:31:25.530
<v Speaker 3>you have to learn it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it feels weird.</v>

3345
02:31:25.531 --> 02:31:27.690
<v Speaker 3>Like you could feel yourself pulling</v>
<v Speaker 3>apart,</v>

3346
02:31:27.720 --> 02:31:29.400
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you have to relax that.</v>

3347
02:31:29.430 --> 02:31:32.940
<v Speaker 3>You have to allow that to happen and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to do it really consistently.</v>

3348
02:31:32.940 --> 02:31:34.890
<v Speaker 3>It has to be something you do all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

3349
02:31:35.070 --> 02:31:37.530
<v Speaker 3>It can't be something you do like once</v>
<v Speaker 3>every now and again,</v>

3350
02:31:37.531 --> 02:31:38.101
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3351
02:31:38.101 --> 02:31:40.680
<v Speaker 3>I'm stretching my back out because it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to go right back.</v>

3352
02:31:40.710 --> 02:31:44.210
<v Speaker 3>And also posture is significant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a really important part of</v>

3353
02:31:44.320 --> 02:31:46.100
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>

3354
02:31:46.440 --> 02:31:46.921
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3355
02:31:46.921 --> 02:31:48.570
<v Speaker 3>that's why these chairs that we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>sitting in,</v>

3356
02:31:48.720 --> 02:31:49.890
<v Speaker 3>we're sitting in these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3357
02:31:49.950 --> 02:31:54.750
<v Speaker 3>Ergo depot chairs and these chairs are</v>
<v Speaker 3>designed to make you sit at a good</v>

3358
02:31:54.751 --> 02:31:56.160
<v Speaker 3>posture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you sit like this,</v>

3359
02:31:56.161 --> 02:31:59.130
<v Speaker 3>you'll sit with your spine in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a good position,</v>

3360
02:31:59.430 --> 02:32:02.580
<v Speaker 3>normal chairs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of times you're back gets rounded</v>

3361
02:32:02.581 --> 02:32:06.240
<v Speaker 3>and you sit into them and he'd sink and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you developed this pain like right</v>

3362
02:32:06.241 --> 02:32:09.300
<v Speaker 3>around your mid back or maybe perhaps</v>
<v Speaker 3>your lower back depending on the,</v>

3363
02:32:09.301 --> 02:32:11.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever ailments you've got these</v>

3364
02:32:11.431 --> 02:32:13.200
<v Speaker 3>chairs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I sit in these fucking things for hours.</v>

3365
02:32:13.200 --> 02:32:16.080
<v Speaker 3>I don't have any problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think they're actually in some way</v>

3366
02:32:16.081 --> 02:32:18.660
<v Speaker 3>beneficial because they force a good</v>
<v Speaker 3>posture that actually,</v>

3367
02:32:18.661 --> 02:32:23.310
<v Speaker 3>it's actually like a static exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They think about the standing a working</v>

3368
02:32:23.311 --> 02:32:25.440
<v Speaker 3>desk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's better than sitting sometimes,</v>

3369
02:32:25.441 --> 02:32:26.100
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3370
02:32:26.100 --> 02:32:27.270
<v Speaker 3>But I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3371
02:32:27.510 --> 02:32:29.130
<v Speaker 3>these things are great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3372
02:32:29.160 --> 02:32:32.760
<v Speaker 3>because these things force your spinal</v>
<v Speaker 3>column to be in this correct position.</v>

3373
02:32:32.761 --> 02:32:35.100
<v Speaker 3>But I think the standing ones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people have a lot of success</v>

3374
02:32:35.101 --> 02:32:36.090
<v Speaker 3>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They also,</v>

3375
02:32:36.091 --> 02:32:38.250
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people have success with those</v>
<v Speaker 3>exercise balls.</v>

3376
02:32:38.490 --> 02:32:40.020
<v Speaker 3>You ever sit on one of those exercise</v>
<v Speaker 3>balls,</v>

3377
02:32:40.380 --> 02:32:43.290
<v Speaker 3>they force you to kind of exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like as you're sitting there,</v>

3378
02:32:43.291 --> 02:32:45.120
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to kind of be adjust in a</v>

3379
02:32:45.121 --> 02:32:46.230
<v Speaker 3>posture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3380
02:32:46.500 --> 02:32:48.390
<v Speaker 3>There's also a lot of those standing</v>
<v Speaker 3>desks,</v>

3381
02:32:48.630 --> 02:32:51.930
<v Speaker 3>they develop these a standing surfaces</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are,</v>

3382
02:32:51.990 --> 02:32:54.630
<v Speaker 3>there are a surface that's very varied.</v>

3383
02:32:54.990 --> 02:32:58.500
<v Speaker 3>So instead of standing on this absolute</v>
<v Speaker 3>flat static,</v>

3384
02:32:58.770 --> 02:33:00.930
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of a floor while you're in the same</v>

3385
02:33:00.931 --> 02:33:02.460
<v Speaker 3>position all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>instead,</v>

3386
02:33:02.700 --> 02:33:06.660
<v Speaker 3>it's this dynamic surface where it has</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these humps to it and you move</v>

3387
02:33:06.661 --> 02:33:08.640
<v Speaker 3>around on it lot like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you'll,</v>

3388
02:33:08.641 --> 02:33:11.430
<v Speaker 3>you'll like lean on the left leg,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll lean on the right leg if you're</v>

3389
02:33:11.431 --> 02:33:13.110
<v Speaker 3>seeing those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See if you can find one of those.</v>

3390
02:33:13.320 --> 02:33:14.153
<v Speaker 3>Those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3391
02:33:14.210 --> 02:33:17.050
<v Speaker 3>surface is standing surfaces,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3392
02:33:17.070 --> 02:33:19.320
<v Speaker 3>for a standing chairs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really interesting.</v>

3393
02:33:19.321 --> 02:33:22.350
<v Speaker 3>I had a complete rupture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my achilles tendon when I was a soccer</v>

3394
02:33:22.351 --> 02:33:24.330
<v Speaker 3>player.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things that I had to do</v>

3395
02:33:24.331 --> 02:33:28.050
<v Speaker 3>in 14 months of Rehab is to stand on one</v>
<v Speaker 3>of those boards with a ball.</v>

3396
02:33:28.270 --> 02:33:33.270
<v Speaker 3>And you had to because just to relearn</v>
<v Speaker 3>how to move in and to adjust.</v>

3397
02:33:33.880 --> 02:33:35.460
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to have a repaired surgically.</v>

3398
02:33:36.930 --> 02:33:37.800
<v Speaker 3>That's a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3399
02:33:38.850 --> 02:33:40.230
<v Speaker 3>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was finished after that.</v>

3400
02:33:40.350 --> 02:33:41.570
<v Speaker 3>I have one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3401
02:33:41.610 --> 02:33:43.250
<v Speaker 3>in my knee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a,</v>

3402
02:33:43.251 --> 02:33:46.050
<v Speaker 3>an Achilles tendon from a cadaver in my</v>
<v Speaker 3>knee.</v>

3403
02:33:46.620 --> 02:33:47.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to,</v>

3404
02:33:47.420 --> 02:33:50.370
<v Speaker 3>when you get acl surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of replacing your acl with a</v>

3405
02:33:50.371 --> 02:33:52.890
<v Speaker 3>cadaver acl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is significantly weaker,</v>

3406
02:33:53.160 --> 02:33:55.480
<v Speaker 3>they take this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the acl tendon or,</v>

3407
02:33:55.650 --> 02:33:59.760
<v Speaker 3>and replace it with Achilles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is way bigger and way stronger and</v>

3408
02:33:59.761 --> 02:34:04.560
<v Speaker 3>it makes your Achilles' tent where it</v>
<v Speaker 3>makes your acl rather 150% stronger than</v>

3409
02:34:04.580 --> 02:34:05.550
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a regular one.</v>

3410
02:34:05.830 --> 02:34:07.770
<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you're aware of how it</v>

3411
02:34:07.771 --> 02:34:10.650
<v Speaker 3>works with cadavers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when they replace a ligament,</v>

3412
02:34:10.710 --> 02:34:15.030
<v Speaker 3>what it does is essentially a acts as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>scaffolding and your body [inaudible]</v>

3413
02:34:15.570 --> 02:34:18.490
<v Speaker 3>this cadaver ligament around your own</v>
<v Speaker 3>cells.</v>

3414
02:34:18.760 --> 02:34:23.290
<v Speaker 4>So instead of it being normal size,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it becomes this fat cord that really</v>

3415
02:34:23.291 --> 02:34:24.380
<v Speaker 4>keeps your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause.</v>

3416
02:34:24.490 --> 02:34:28.270
<v Speaker 4>I've had both my knees blowout to acl</v>
<v Speaker 4>reconstructions.</v>

3417
02:34:28.330 --> 02:34:29.680
<v Speaker 4>One in each knee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3418
02:34:29.681 --> 02:34:31.360
<v Speaker 4>that's not it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's other ones.</v>

3419
02:34:31.361 --> 02:34:32.860
<v Speaker 4>That's just the chair.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This guy's on.</v>

3420
02:34:32.890 --> 02:34:36.100
<v Speaker 4>It's a standing desk surface,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3421
02:34:36.350 --> 02:34:38.560
<v Speaker 4>standing surface,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pull up,</v>

3422
02:34:38.561 --> 02:34:40.870
<v Speaker 4>standing surface for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3423
02:34:41.170 --> 02:34:45.130
<v Speaker 4>for standing desk or surface for</v>
<v Speaker 4>standing desk.</v>

3424
02:34:45.790 --> 02:34:48.940
<v Speaker 4>Standing desk surface for standing on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>

3425
02:34:49.210 --> 02:34:50.210
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3426
02:34:50.220 --> 02:34:52.450
<v Speaker 4>I bet ergo depot has it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3427
02:34:52.480 --> 02:34:54.010
<v Speaker 4>there's a bunch of those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3428
02:34:54.250 --> 02:34:59.140
<v Speaker 4>different kinds of standing desks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but moving surface for standing desk.</v>

3429
02:34:59.200 --> 02:35:00.920
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just don't show me this way.</v>

3430
02:35:00.990 --> 02:35:03.820
<v Speaker 4>You're going to go fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>

3431
02:35:03.850 --> 02:35:05.170
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know if it's good.</v>

3432
02:35:05.200 --> 02:35:08.170
<v Speaker 4>I just saw that someone developed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when I had my,</v>

3433
02:35:08.171 --> 02:35:10.920
<v Speaker 4>a ruptured Achilles tendon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm the trip.</v>

3434
02:35:10.921 --> 02:35:12.880
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever heard somebody describe</v>
<v Speaker 4>what happens?</v>

3435
02:35:13.210 --> 02:35:18.210
<v Speaker 4>You actually feel as if somebody hits</v>
<v Speaker 4>you with a sledgehammer on your Achilles</v>

3436
02:35:19.031 --> 02:35:20.230
<v Speaker 4>tendon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When it pops,</v>

3437
02:35:20.560 --> 02:35:22.300
<v Speaker 4>it feels like you were hit and you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3438
02:35:22.301 --> 02:35:25.660
<v Speaker 4>you drop,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like somebody shot you after the fact.</v>

3439
02:35:25.661 --> 02:35:27.400
<v Speaker 4>So I had the surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This was,</v>

3440
02:35:27.401 --> 02:35:30.670
<v Speaker 4>I was a student,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a graduate student at the time at</v>

3441
02:35:30.671 --> 02:35:32.620
<v Speaker 4>Cornell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went back to Montreal to have the</v>

3442
02:35:32.621 --> 02:35:33.650
<v Speaker 4>surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I,</v>

3443
02:35:33.670 --> 02:35:37.360
<v Speaker 4>when I went back to Cornell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I asked my fellow soccer players what</v>

3444
02:35:37.361 --> 02:35:39.400
<v Speaker 4>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who was the guy who tackled me,</v>

3445
02:35:39.840 --> 02:35:41.020
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that had hit me.</v>

3446
02:35:41.170 --> 02:35:43.270
<v Speaker 4>And then somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nobody hits you.</v>

3447
02:35:43.271 --> 02:35:45.580
<v Speaker 4>You just dropped by herself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I had done,</v>

3448
02:35:45.790 --> 02:35:47.830
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I found out that that's what everybody</v>

3449
02:35:47.831 --> 02:35:50.260
<v Speaker 4>feels like an explosion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an explosion.</v>

3450
02:35:50.261 --> 02:35:53.650
<v Speaker 4>But the way your body feels it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's as if there was an impact.</v>

3451
02:35:53.660 --> 02:35:56.980
<v Speaker 4>Someone just clobbered the back of my</v>
<v Speaker 4>leg.</v>

3452
02:35:57.310 --> 02:35:58.150
<v Speaker 4>Nobody was around.</v>

3453
02:35:58.150 --> 02:35:59.950
<v Speaker 4>I just dropped.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That totally makes sense.</v>

3454
02:35:59.951 --> 02:36:02.320
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing how fragile we are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's incredible.</v>

3455
02:36:02.350 --> 02:36:04.810
<v Speaker 4>People are so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was like the human body that's</v>

3456
02:36:04.811 --> 02:36:06.130
<v Speaker 4>similar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's one of them.</v>

3457
02:36:06.580 --> 02:36:08.260
<v Speaker 4>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a standing board.</v>

3458
02:36:08.261 --> 02:36:13.060
<v Speaker 4>This one is a surface is a surface you</v>
<v Speaker 4>stand on and it's just an uneven surface</v>

3459
02:36:13.061 --> 02:36:15.340
<v Speaker 4>that has many different layers to it and</v>
<v Speaker 4>many different,</v>

3460
02:36:15.341 --> 02:36:19.990
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so now it's Sunday at either whatever,</v>

3461
02:36:20.260 --> 02:36:22.120
<v Speaker 4>there's a bunch of them I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

3462
02:36:22.121 --> 02:36:25.270
<v Speaker 4>there's all these different solutions</v>
<v Speaker 4>that people try to come up with for the</v>

3463
02:36:25.271 --> 02:36:28.030
<v Speaker 4>real problem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is not sitting in the proper</v>

3464
02:36:28.031 --> 02:36:29.680
<v Speaker 4>posture at a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at a chair.</v>

3465
02:36:29.710 --> 02:36:33.790
<v Speaker 4>And I sit in this desk doing these</v>
<v Speaker 4>podcasts for like yesterday I did nine</v>

3466
02:36:33.791 --> 02:36:34.720
<v Speaker 4>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

3467
02:36:34.750 --> 02:36:36.310
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when I'm doing that,</v>

3468
02:36:36.311 --> 02:36:38.270
<v Speaker 4>I'm just sitting like this and my back</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't hurt it.</v>

3469
02:36:38.280 --> 02:36:42.490
<v Speaker 4>She didn't feel that your mental acuity</v>
<v Speaker 4>is as strong going into podcast number</v>

3470
02:36:42.491 --> 02:36:47.440
<v Speaker 4>three as it was in number one or yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's only nine hours.</v>

3471
02:36:47.440 --> 02:36:50.350
<v Speaker 4>It's not that big a deal as long as</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're eating food.</v>

3472
02:36:50.370 --> 02:36:52.450
<v Speaker 4>And I asked this is because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3473
02:36:52.480 --> 02:36:56.260
<v Speaker 4>earlier in my teaching career,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could do back to back lectures,</v>

3474
02:36:56.320 --> 02:36:59.500
<v Speaker 4>each one being three hours and it was no</v>
<v Speaker 4>problem.</v>

3475
02:36:59.890 --> 02:37:02.830
<v Speaker 4>Now I can't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not because of mental acuity problems,</v>

3476
02:37:03.130 --> 02:37:07.720
<v Speaker 4>but because when I send me back back</v>
<v Speaker 4>starts hurting by about hour for,</v>

3477
02:37:07.721 --> 02:37:09.410
<v Speaker 4>I can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well let's wrap this up and I'm gonna,</v>

3478
02:37:09.430 --> 02:37:10.690
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna show you all this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>equipment,</v>

3479
02:37:10.691 --> 02:37:12.200
<v Speaker 4>because you should really invest in this</v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

3480
02:37:12.270 --> 02:37:14.380
<v Speaker 4>So it'll make a big difference in your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>

3481
02:37:14.381 --> 02:37:17.630
<v Speaker 4>the health of your back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because it's one thing we really didn't,</v>

3482
02:37:17.690 --> 02:37:20.030
<v Speaker 4>they just don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't look into enough.</v>

3483
02:37:20.060 --> 02:37:22.280
<v Speaker 4>And the only time they look into it is</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they're already injured.</v>

3484
02:37:22.330 --> 02:37:22.941
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

3485
02:37:22.941 --> 02:37:25.490
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really wish people would pay way more</v>

3486
02:37:25.491 --> 02:37:28.370
<v Speaker 4>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I wish I had known this before I got</v>

3487
02:37:28.371 --> 02:37:29.204
<v Speaker 4>injured.</v>

3488
02:37:29.420 --> 02:37:32.750
<v Speaker 4>I got injured from martial arts because</v>
<v Speaker 4>just the nature of Jujitsu and</v>

3489
02:37:32.751 --> 02:37:34.910
<v Speaker 4>wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of people that I get in.</v>

3490
02:37:34.911 --> 02:37:38.660
<v Speaker 4>I know a lot of guys that have had disc</v>
<v Speaker 4>replacements and all sorts of fusions</v>

3491
02:37:38.661 --> 02:37:41.040
<v Speaker 4>and stuff and it's just the brutal</v>
<v Speaker 4>nature of,</v>

3492
02:37:41.041 --> 02:37:42.560
<v Speaker 4>of the sport.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

3493
02:37:42.590 --> 02:37:43.670
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3494
02:37:43.671 --> 02:37:47.570
<v Speaker 4>I think some of that at least can be</v>
<v Speaker 4>prevented with proper maintenance and</v>

3495
02:37:47.571 --> 02:37:49.520
<v Speaker 4>proper spine health.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3496
02:37:49.550 --> 02:37:52.030
<v Speaker 4>Decompression stretching.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I look forward to do yoga at all.</v>

3497
02:37:52.520 --> 02:37:53.690
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should do it.</v>

3498
02:37:53.720 --> 02:37:54.261
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3499
02:37:54.261 --> 02:37:57.290
<v Speaker 4>I do stretching,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I do it in exactly the way that you</v>

3500
02:37:57.291 --> 02:38:00.980
<v Speaker 4>said I shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is very sporadic and yeah,</v>

3501
02:38:01.010 --> 02:38:02.590
<v Speaker 4>don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He got,</v>

3502
02:38:02.620 --> 02:38:04.370
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of a daily thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

3503
02:38:04.371 --> 02:38:06.320
<v Speaker 4>It's gotta be one of those things like</v>
<v Speaker 4>brushing your teeth,</v>

3504
02:38:06.360 --> 02:38:07.670
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You write down,</v>

3505
02:38:07.820 --> 02:38:09.770
<v Speaker 4>you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get it out of the way.</v>

3506
02:38:09.800 --> 02:38:11.660
<v Speaker 4>Just force yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To me,</v>

3507
02:38:11.661 --> 02:38:15.710
<v Speaker 4>there's certain things that I just can't</v>
<v Speaker 4>go through a week without doing,</v>

3508
02:38:16.010 --> 02:38:18.680
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I don't allow myself because I know</v>

3509
02:38:18.681 --> 02:38:22.130
<v Speaker 4>that there's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's easy to just fuck off and not do it</v>

3510
02:38:22.160 --> 02:38:23.870
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's easy to just be lazy,</v>

3511
02:38:23.990 --> 02:38:25.700
<v Speaker 4>but when you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

3512
02:38:25.760 --> 02:38:29.590
<v Speaker 4>you do your body a disservice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You quick final anecdote before we end,</v>

3513
02:38:29.591 --> 02:38:33.260
<v Speaker 4>I know we have to end just to point to</v>
<v Speaker 4>your incredible reach.</v>

3514
02:38:33.560 --> 02:38:34.341
<v Speaker 4>So I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3515
02:38:34.341 --> 02:38:36.350
<v Speaker 4>I'm recognized on the street reasonably</v>
<v Speaker 4>off.</v>

3516
02:38:36.351 --> 02:38:37.430
<v Speaker 4>We usually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's because of the visual.</v>

3517
02:38:37.431 --> 02:38:38.740
<v Speaker 4>Beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Beautiful,</v>

3518
02:38:38.760 --> 02:38:40.550
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is what happened about two weeks</v>

3519
02:38:40.551 --> 02:38:42.410
<v Speaker 4>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I might've even tattooed you on</v>

3520
02:38:42.470 --> 02:38:43.910
<v Speaker 4>twitter about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're probably going to read it.</v>

3521
02:38:44.360 --> 02:38:48.210
<v Speaker 4>I'm being served by a waiter slash bus</v>
<v Speaker 4>boy at a place in,</v>

3522
02:38:49.080 --> 02:38:50.450
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Venice beach.</v>

3523
02:38:50.840 --> 02:38:52.850
<v Speaker 4>And the gentleman comes up to me and</v>
<v Speaker 4>says,</v>

3524
02:38:52.910 --> 02:38:54.730
<v Speaker 4>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are you?</v>

3525
02:38:56.420 --> 02:38:57.350
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>

3526
02:38:57.710 --> 02:38:58.401
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3527
02:38:58.401 --> 02:39:03.401
<v Speaker 4>I recognized you by your voice because I</v>
<v Speaker 4>listened to Joe Rogan's podcast.</v>

3528
02:39:05.320 --> 02:39:09.320
<v Speaker 4>So this is the first time that I was</v>
<v Speaker 4>recognized auditorily,</v>

3529
02:39:09.380 --> 02:39:11.990
<v Speaker 4>not visually.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a pretty astute listener.</v>

3530
02:39:12.110 --> 02:39:15.050
<v Speaker 4>That's a guy who really listens to Joe</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rogan.</v>

3531
02:39:15.110 --> 02:39:15.790
<v Speaker 4>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3532
02:39:15.790 --> 02:39:20.790
<v Speaker 4>I say that story simply to point to</v>
<v Speaker 4>apparently how infinite you'll reaches.</v>

3533
02:39:21.020 --> 02:39:23.480
<v Speaker 4>That's pretty crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or I have a very unique,</v>

3534
02:39:23.570 --> 02:39:25.370
<v Speaker 4>very sexy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they definitely have that.</v>

3535
02:39:25.400 --> 02:39:27.350
<v Speaker 4>You definitely have that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I also think that guy is probably</v>

3536
02:39:27.351 --> 02:39:30.020
<v Speaker 4>pretty exceptional in his ability to</v>
