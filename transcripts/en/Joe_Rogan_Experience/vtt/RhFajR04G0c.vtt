1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.620
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:03.001
<v Speaker 1>They're ridiculous.</v>

3
00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:05.070
<v Speaker 1>I never seen ball so big in my life.</v>

4
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:06.270
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even make sense.</v>

5
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:06.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.280
<v Speaker 1>Which brings me up to a very important point.</v>

7
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.440
<v Speaker 1>Check this out my next door.</v>

8
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:10.930
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

9
00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:11.763
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say that.</v>

10
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:13.140
<v Speaker 1>Some people that I know.</v>

11
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:15.180
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>

12
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:15.721
<v Speaker 1>Can I say it?</v>

13
00:00:15.721 --> 00:00:16.531
<v Speaker 1>The people that I know,</v>

14
00:00:16.531 --> 00:00:17.550
<v Speaker 1>they're very nice people.</v>

15
00:00:17.551 --> 00:00:18.840
<v Speaker 1>There's this gay couple,</v>

16
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.823
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

17
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.890
<v Speaker 1>they had a kid and they impregnated a woman with their loads and the way they</v>

18
00:00:25.651 --> 00:00:30.651
<v Speaker 1>did it was they put their loads together and then they mixed it up and then they</v>

19
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.250
<v Speaker 1>squirt it in fall.</v>

20
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:33.670
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

21
00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

22
00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:34.471
<v Speaker 1>they're off.</v>

23
00:00:34.471 --> 00:00:35.101
<v Speaker 1>And it was just like,</v>

24
00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:35.741
<v Speaker 1>hopefully it's my,</v>

25
00:00:35.741 --> 00:00:36.480
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking shit.</v>

26
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.100
<v Speaker 1>What's fascinating about that?</v>

27
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's fascinating about that cause it's kind of weird.</v>

28
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.580
<v Speaker 1>Like they,</v>

29
00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:41.311
<v Speaker 1>they really did,</v>

30
00:00:41.311 --> 00:00:42.630
<v Speaker 1>they didn't just adopt a baby.</v>

31
00:00:42.631 --> 00:00:44.850
<v Speaker 1>They created a baby with their own genetics.</v>

32
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.740
<v Speaker 1>Like they have a couple somehow or another.</v>

33
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean they'll figure out eventually whose baby it really is,</v>

34
00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:49.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

35
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.570
<v Speaker 1>especially if they get in fights or something like that.</v>

36
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.410
<v Speaker 1>But the idea is that somehow or another,</v>

37
00:00:55.411 --> 00:00:56.610
<v Speaker 1>you know you're going to figure out,</v>

38
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:56.851
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

39
00:00:56.851 --> 00:00:57.570
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get this,</v>

40
00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.250
<v Speaker 1>these loads in there and then it's gonna,</v>

41
00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

42
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.050
<v Speaker 1>they're going to just have a race,</v>

43
00:01:01.051 --> 00:01:02.010
<v Speaker 1>but they're not going to have a race.</v>

44
00:01:02.011 --> 00:01:03.240
<v Speaker 1>They're going to murder each other.</v>

45
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.800
<v Speaker 1>Like a big percentage of the loads that you shoot are just murderous sperm</v>

46
00:01:09.061 --> 00:01:09.894
<v Speaker 1>killers.</v>

47
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.420
<v Speaker 1>They're all they want to do is go kill other sperm.</v>

48
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.670
<v Speaker 1>They're sent out there to make sure that the sperm is already in the cooter.</v>

49
00:01:16.671 --> 00:01:17.820
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't get to the eggs.</v>

50
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.160
<v Speaker 1>And so they attack and they go smash it.</v>

51
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.590
<v Speaker 1>And the more promiscuous the women are,</v>

52
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.820
<v Speaker 1>the more your body produces more of these crazy killer sperm.</v>

53
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.970
<v Speaker 1>That's why ball size is directly proportional to female slots in the community.</v>

54
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.280
<v Speaker 1>So like that's why gorillas have little balls.</v>

55
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.340
<v Speaker 1>Gorillas have little balls because female gorillas are chill.</v>

56
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:39.203
<v Speaker 1>They're not horse.</v>

57
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:44.220
<v Speaker 1>Chimpanzees have giant balls because female chimps are fucking whores.</v>

58
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.151
<v Speaker 1>They're whores.</v>

59
00:01:45.151 --> 00:01:46.050
<v Speaker 1>They just want chimp,</v>

60
00:01:46.051 --> 00:01:47.680
<v Speaker 1>Dick all over town Kerry.</v>

61
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.320
<v Speaker 1>And so these chimps have to force those killer loads in there so that their</v>

62
00:01:52.321 --> 00:01:54.480
<v Speaker 1>genetics can move on to attack the loads.</v>

63
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.790
<v Speaker 1>So these guys in creating this baby,</v>

64
00:01:56.791 --> 00:02:00.690
<v Speaker 1>they really launched this sperm fucking genocide campaign where they just</v>

65
00:02:00.691 --> 00:02:01.524
<v Speaker 1>attacked each other.</v>

66
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.160
<v Speaker 1>The dish.</v>

67
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.931
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

68
00:02:02.931 --> 00:02:03.420
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

69
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.180
<v Speaker 1>there's no harmony in the in that there is no harmony in the,</v>

70
00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.871
<v Speaker 1>you never should do.</v>

71
00:02:06.871 --> 00:02:11.490
<v Speaker 1>They should have like a like seethrough flashlights and then let's all fuck it</v>

72
00:02:11.491 --> 00:02:14.070
<v Speaker 1>and there'll be like an ant farm and we'll just watch all this shit to go down</v>

73
00:02:14.071 --> 00:02:14.904
<v Speaker 1>on the fighter.</v>

74
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.870
<v Speaker 1>The sperm.</v>

75
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:16.220
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

76
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.390
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if you could that's told.</v>

77
00:02:18.391 --> 00:02:18.811
<v Speaker 1>True,</v>

78
00:02:18.811 --> 00:02:19.550
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

79
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you were like,</v>

80
00:02:21.361 --> 00:02:22.080
<v Speaker 1>you know like you,</v>

81
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.620
<v Speaker 1>you had a box and you can only,</v>

82
00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.770
<v Speaker 1>well you don't want her to see each other while you're shooting loads,</v>

83
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:27.500
<v Speaker 1>but if you,</v>

84
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.330
<v Speaker 1>you had like something like on [inaudible] Room,</v>

85
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:31.830
<v Speaker 1>Bluetooth like video,</v>

86
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.220
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's like years a hole in the wall and the fleshlight is attached to the</v>

87
00:02:35.221 --> 00:02:38.100
<v Speaker 1>hole in the wall and you're in one room fucking it and your friends and another</v>

88
00:02:38.101 --> 00:02:41.460
<v Speaker 1>one fucking and it falls into the center and that's the catch tray.</v>

89
00:02:41.461 --> 00:02:44.790
<v Speaker 1>And then it mixes them all together under some super powerful microscope and we</v>

90
00:02:44.791 --> 00:02:46.410
<v Speaker 1>would watch sperm wars,</v>

91
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.410
<v Speaker 1>sperm wars.</v>

92
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.910
<v Speaker 1>If you imagine that would be like,</v>

93
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.873
<v Speaker 1>let's just,</v>

94
00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:52.830
<v Speaker 1>let's just pitch it,</v>

95
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.521
<v Speaker 1>pitch it,</v>

96
00:02:53.521 --> 00:02:54.240
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

97
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.950
<v Speaker 1>Least set up a meeting and just pitch it around.</v>

98
00:02:55.951 --> 00:02:58.440
<v Speaker 1>How I see the look on people's faces.</v>

99
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.820
<v Speaker 1>It's like you want me to put our names on it?</v>

100
00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.210
<v Speaker 1>Let me just say we're totally committed to this show.</v>

101
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:05.561
<v Speaker 1>Like this is our,</v>

102
00:03:05.561 --> 00:03:07.470
<v Speaker 1>this is our fucking dream for Morris.</v>

103
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.970
<v Speaker 1>It's actually a good idea for a show.</v>

104
00:03:09.971 --> 00:03:13.880
<v Speaker 1>You could have a show where you took celebrities and you,</v>

105
00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:14.190
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

106
00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.370
<v Speaker 1>you shot their loads.</v>

107
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.690
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

108
00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:16.451
<v Speaker 1>they do this,</v>

109
00:03:16.451 --> 00:03:16.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

110
00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.990
<v Speaker 1>they don't,</v>

111
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:18.250
<v Speaker 1>they don't have to actually do it.</v>

112
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.701
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

113
00:03:18.701 --> 00:03:21.880
<v Speaker 1>you just pretend they're doing it and then the animate what's going on with</v>

114
00:03:21.881 --> 00:03:22.714
<v Speaker 1>their loads.</v>

115
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.441
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

116
00:03:23.441 --> 00:03:24.274
<v Speaker 1>that'd be sweet.</v>

117
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.910
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

118
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.450
<v Speaker 1>like Dwayne the Rock Johnson versus Brock Lesnar,</v>

119
00:03:28.451 --> 00:03:30.580
<v Speaker 1>get their loads together and battle it out.</v>

120
00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.470
<v Speaker 1>You could have like fucking Daniel Day Lewis versus fucking Jeremy Irons.</v>

121
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.131
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

122
00:03:36.131 --> 00:03:36.791
<v Speaker 1>I like that.</v>

123
00:03:36.791 --> 00:03:38.440
<v Speaker 1>One class a sperm fight.</v>

124
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.333

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.300
<v Speaker 1>Sperm,</v>

127
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.810
<v Speaker 1>English accent and sperms.</v>

128
00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.811
<v Speaker 1>Sperms.</v>

129
00:03:44.811 --> 00:03:46.030
<v Speaker 1>So white gloves.</v>

130
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.893
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

131
00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:47.321
<v Speaker 1>Tool.</v>

132
00:03:47.321 --> 00:03:48.154
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps.</v>

133
00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.660
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

134
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:49.493
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

135
00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.110
<v Speaker 1>that's semen duo too.</v>

136
00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.963
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

137
00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:14.453
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

138
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:23.740
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

139
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:24.401
<v Speaker 1>freaks and Geeks.</v>

140
00:04:24.401 --> 00:04:25.151
<v Speaker 1>Lovers and children.</v>

141
00:04:25.151 --> 00:04:25.720
<v Speaker 1>What's going on.</v>
