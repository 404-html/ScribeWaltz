00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.830

00:00:43.831 --> 00:00:48.831
<v Speaker 1>of was he was downtown in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking some photographs and from there</v>

14
00:00:50.101 --> 00:00:51.840
<v Speaker 1>on it's a bunch of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

15
00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.140
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he says and what I'm sure the woman</v>

16
00:00:55.141 --> 00:00:57.660
<v Speaker 1>who beat the shit out of them would have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a different story,</v>

17
00:00:57.661 --> 00:00:59.520
<v Speaker 1>but he was taking some photographs.</v>

18
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.090
<v Speaker 1>One of one of the photographs was of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

19
00:01:02.091 --> 00:01:04.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are those things called when you,</v>

20
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things we scaffold staffing.</v>

21
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.610
<v Speaker 1>Scaffolding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's walking through the scaffolding,</v>

22
00:01:08.611 --> 00:01:11.010
<v Speaker 1>a woman was coming towards him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looked like he was just taking a</v>

23
00:01:11.011 --> 00:01:14.100
<v Speaker 1>bunch of cool photos of New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of them that he put up</v>

24
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.600
<v Speaker 1>on his instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

25
00:01:15.601 --> 00:01:19.080
<v Speaker 1>this woman got upset that he was taking</v>
<v Speaker 1>a photo of her,</v>

26
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.280
<v Speaker 1>probably thought that he was perving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got mad at them,</v>

27
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.130
<v Speaker 1>violence ensued.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She hit him and he went on twitter and</v>

28
00:01:26.131 --> 00:01:31.131
<v Speaker 1>went on this rant about violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the black community and their</v>

29
00:01:31.411 --> 00:01:35.070
<v Speaker 1>propensity for violence about this woman</v>
<v Speaker 1>calling her an animal,</v>

30
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.240
<v Speaker 1>which she did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a serious fire them and which left a</v>

31
00:01:39.241 --> 00:01:42.690
<v Speaker 1>fucking huge hole in my entertainment</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

32
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.300
<v Speaker 1>The opiod,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anthony shows my all time favorite radio</v>

33
00:01:45.301 --> 00:01:47.940
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I listened to it all the time and now</v>

34
00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:49.230
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden it is no more.</v>

35
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

36
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a huge hole to no one panicked like</v>

37
00:01:54.171 --> 00:01:56.990
<v Speaker 2>may cause opie and Anthony both have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you money.</v>

38
00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.390
<v Speaker 2>Jim Norton doesn't so selfishly</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>

39
00:01:59.391 --> 00:01:59.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

40
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.210
<v Speaker 2>there goes everything because the show's</v>
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>

41
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.700
<v Speaker 1>You are always going to be great because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a funny comment and they can</v>

42
00:02:05.701 --> 00:02:07.800
<v Speaker 1>always work and you never have to worry</v>
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>

43
00:02:07.801 --> 00:02:11.100
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is a crazy thing,</v>

44
00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.130
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

45
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden like that for things</v>

46
00:02:16.201 --> 00:02:19.880
<v Speaker 2>that he said on the show 100 times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think when I started,</v>

47
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.110
<v Speaker 2>I think what happened was he tweeted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he told,</v>

48
00:02:22.111 --> 00:02:25.800
<v Speaker 2>I talked to him multiple times since</v>
<v Speaker 2>then he was walking and people don't</v>

49
00:02:25.801 --> 00:02:28.230
<v Speaker 2>believe that he was actually taken</v>
<v Speaker 2>legitimate New York photos.</v>

50
00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:29.610
<v Speaker 2>That was one of the points of</v>
<v Speaker 2>contention.</v>

51
00:02:29.611 --> 00:02:32.850
<v Speaker 2>People like he was being creepy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he really wasn't like anthony has</v>

52
00:02:32.851 --> 00:02:37.851
<v Speaker 2>had this giant Hubble like camera in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>studio everyday for probably six months</v>

53
00:02:39.451 --> 00:02:41.850
<v Speaker 2>now he's getting into photography.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's what he's been doing.</v>

54
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.390
<v Speaker 2>So that was not unusual at all to hear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was out and about taking photos.</v>

55
00:02:45.391 --> 00:02:48.840
<v Speaker 2>That's legit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I guess this woman got angry and I,</v>

56
00:02:48.841 --> 00:02:51.060
<v Speaker 2>I talked to him and he said that she</v>
<v Speaker 2>just said something like,</v>

57
00:02:51.061 --> 00:02:52.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this white boys taking my picture,</v>

58
00:02:52.681 --> 00:02:53.580
<v Speaker 2>you wiped by the or whatever.</v>

59
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.580
<v Speaker 2>She said she clocked him and he kept</v>
<v Speaker 2>defending himself as he's putting his</v>

60
00:02:58.651 --> 00:03:00.340
<v Speaker 2>arms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She is going,</v>

61
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.740
<v Speaker 2>don't touch me like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

62
00:03:02.741 --> 00:03:05.830
<v Speaker 2>that thing like that a woman might do to</v>
<v Speaker 2>prevent you from hitting her.</v>

63
00:03:05.831 --> 00:03:09.370
<v Speaker 2>Like you could see how frightening that</v>
<v Speaker 2>would be because then people think</v>

64
00:03:09.371 --> 00:03:12.370
<v Speaker 2>you're beating on this woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's putting his hand up and,</v>

65
00:03:12.371 --> 00:03:13.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know well enough to know he's not</v>

66
00:03:13.961 --> 00:03:15.490
<v Speaker 2>going to just punch a woman in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>phase.</v>

67
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.090
<v Speaker 2>So she's doing that and I think a few</v>
<v Speaker 2>black guys came round and they didn't do</v>

68
00:03:19.091 --> 00:03:20.140
<v Speaker 2>anything to amp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there were like,</v>

69
00:03:20.141 --> 00:03:21.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't touch her.</v>

70
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:22.570
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

71
00:03:22.571 --> 00:03:24.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and who has always armed and he's</v>

72
00:03:24.401 --> 00:03:27.010
<v Speaker 2>licensed to carry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't hit her.</v>

73
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:32.490
<v Speaker 2>It didn't pull out his pistol and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>went home and I guess was really upset</v>

74
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.080
<v Speaker 2>and went out on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>

75
00:03:35.081 --> 00:03:38.620
<v Speaker 2>a twitter rampage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

76
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.000
<v Speaker 2>I knew it was bad the next morning when</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw it because my ex girlfriend called</v>

77
00:03:43.001 --> 00:03:45.250
<v Speaker 2>me and she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happened with Anthony got beat up</v>

78
00:03:45.251 --> 00:03:47.100
<v Speaker 2>by a woman?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know.</v>

79
00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.660
<v Speaker 2>So I looked and I saw the tweets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

80
00:03:49.661 --> 00:03:51.060
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually texted him about one.</v>

81
00:03:51.061 --> 00:03:52.180
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I've ever done that</v>
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

82
00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:53.740
<v Speaker 2>There was one that I texted her around</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

83
00:03:53.741 --> 00:03:54.580
<v Speaker 2>it was you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

84
00:03:54.581 --> 00:03:55.414
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does it?</v>

85
00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:56.111
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

86
00:03:56.111 --> 00:03:58.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm Coco was scary.</v>

87
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.540
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

88
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:01.463
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

89
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.470
<v Speaker 1>the thing about Andy is he's developed</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sort of style of communicating on</v>

90
00:04:07.351 --> 00:04:12.030
<v Speaker 1>the show where he goes on these long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hilarious,</v>

91
00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:17.090
<v Speaker 1>entertaining profanity filled rants and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's one thing about hearing it,</v>

92
00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.930
<v Speaker 1>but there's another thing of like seeing</v>
<v Speaker 1>it in a text form is just not the same.</v>

93
00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.130
<v Speaker 2>It looks things don't look good in</v>
<v Speaker 2>print.</v>

94
00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.950
<v Speaker 2>Certain things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think what happened was,</v>

95
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.280
<v Speaker 2>is in the middle of like when you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>either contextual conversation,</v>

96
00:04:33.281 --> 00:04:35.140
<v Speaker 2>it's like you have people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's inflection,</v>

97
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.910
<v Speaker 2>there's another guy next to you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

98
00:04:36.911 --> 00:04:37.840
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean by that?</v>

99
00:04:37.841 --> 00:04:40.030
<v Speaker 2>And then you're clarifying it or it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

100
00:04:40.031 --> 00:04:44.020
<v Speaker 2>it's a different energy when you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>tweeting and you're that mad.</v>

101
00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.300
<v Speaker 2>Like I think like any type of an</v>
<v Speaker 2>assault,</v>

102
00:04:46.301 --> 00:04:48.790
<v Speaker 2>even if it's a woman hitting you and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not life threatening,</v>

103
00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.970
<v Speaker 2>it's still like an hour later you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

104
00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.010
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just happened like I think it just</v>

105
00:04:54.011 --> 00:04:55.720
<v Speaker 2>freaked him out and she hit him a couple</v>
<v Speaker 2>times,</v>

106
00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.270
<v Speaker 2>five times or so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she sent me a picture of his face</v>

107
00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.610
<v Speaker 2>and he had like a little.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could see that he had been struck,</v>

108
00:05:00.611 --> 00:05:05.290
<v Speaker 2>you mean it wasn't making it up and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>he went on and when I looked at the flow</v>

109
00:05:05.291 --> 00:05:08.080
<v Speaker 2>of things like I know anthony and I know</v>
<v Speaker 2>what he's saying.</v>

110
00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.880
<v Speaker 2>He was not calling all black people</v>
<v Speaker 2>animals.</v>

111
00:05:09.881 --> 00:05:13.270
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't because he's never said that</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's talking about a behavior of this</v>

112
00:05:13.271 --> 00:05:17.560
<v Speaker 2>woman and I think that what happened was</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was so mad and when you're tweeting</v>

113
00:05:17.561 --> 00:05:20.440
<v Speaker 2>that aggressively and you've just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're fucking dealing with this in your</v>

114
00:05:20.441 --> 00:05:24.520
<v Speaker 2>head that sometimes things come out</v>
<v Speaker 2>jumbled and muddied and like if you know</v>

115
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:26.560
<v Speaker 2>what he's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who don't know him or reading</v>

116
00:05:26.561 --> 00:05:27.790
<v Speaker 2>this score,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does he mean?</v>

117
00:05:27.791 --> 00:05:30.400
<v Speaker 2>He's saying that there's violence in</v>
<v Speaker 2>black people and their animals,</v>

118
00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:35.380
<v Speaker 2>like people are putting these pieces of</v>
<v Speaker 2>a puzzle together and they're making a</v>

119
00:05:35.381 --> 00:05:38.310
<v Speaker 2>picture and it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just.</v>

120
00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.980
<v Speaker 2>I know him well enough to know that in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation.</v>

121
00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.900
<v Speaker 2>If someone said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you trying to say black people or</v>

122
00:05:43.901 --> 00:05:44.471
<v Speaker 2>animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would go,</v>

123
00:05:44.471 --> 00:05:45.101
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not at all.</v>

124
00:05:45.101 --> 00:05:47.530
<v Speaker 2>It's a behavioral based to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

125
00:05:47.531 --> 00:05:49.450
<v Speaker 2>Because you said that about white people</v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

126
00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.510
<v Speaker 2>So I mean it was just one of those</v>
<v Speaker 2>things where once it was in print,</v>

127
00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.570
<v Speaker 2>it's even in context,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we lie as a country like,</v>

128
00:05:55.571 --> 00:05:57.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when cancel cancelcolbert came out</v>

129
00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:58.130
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the</v>

130
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.850
<v Speaker 1>activist knew the context that he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>making those Asian jokes and didn't give</v>

131
00:06:01.851 --> 00:06:03.590
<v Speaker 1>a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She still wanted to sink them.</v>

132
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:04.120
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

133
00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.731
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

134
00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:05.564
<v Speaker 1>He was trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

135
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.360
<v Speaker 1>show the difference between the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing between this and native Americans</v>

136
00:06:08.361 --> 00:06:10.250
<v Speaker 1>and how ridiculous it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't care.</v>

137
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.670
<v Speaker 1>So we've gotten to a point now where we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't even pretend to not understand</v>

138
00:06:13.671 --> 00:06:16.340
<v Speaker 1>the context anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We admit that we understand the context</v>

139
00:06:16.341 --> 00:06:21.341
<v Speaker 1>of we go after people anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So something like this is bound to a to</v>

140
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:26.270
<v Speaker 1>sink you because it can be taken both</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways unless you actually sit there and</v>

141
00:06:26.271 --> 00:06:29.360
<v Speaker 1>talk to the guy and each tweet has to</v>
<v Speaker 1>come out like a film.</v>

142
00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:33.650
<v Speaker 1>Each tweet has to be a beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle and end with no explanation</v>

143
00:06:33.651 --> 00:06:37.850
<v Speaker 1>needed around it in order to to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>survivable.</v>

144
00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:38.913
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Makes Sense.</v>

145
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.401
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

146
00:06:39.401 --> 00:06:42.500
<v Speaker 1>want the big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big key to what you said that it could</v>

147
00:06:42.501 --> 00:06:43.700
<v Speaker 1>sink you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

148
00:06:43.701 --> 00:06:47.270
<v Speaker 1>it only syncs you if you work for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>company and in my opinion that's</v>

149
00:06:47.271 --> 00:06:50.840
<v Speaker 1>unnecessary and in this day and age it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>unnecessary.</v>

150
00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:55.280
<v Speaker 1>And I think you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think Anthony for sure would be</v>

151
00:06:55.281 --> 00:06:59.840
<v Speaker 1>far better off with a podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody can get a podcast and put it on</v>

152
00:06:59.841 --> 00:07:02.330
<v Speaker 1>their phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now everybody's phone has a little Jack</v>

153
00:07:02.331 --> 00:07:04.970
<v Speaker 1>that sticks into your car and you play</v>
<v Speaker 1>your phone through your car.</v>

154
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.650
<v Speaker 1>Everybody has that now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

155
00:07:06.651 --> 00:07:10.520
<v Speaker 1>it's not an uncommon thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more common to have that Jack than</v>

156
00:07:10.521 --> 00:07:13.460
<v Speaker 1>it is to have satellite radio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people have to get a satellite</v>

157
00:07:13.461 --> 00:07:16.220
<v Speaker 1>radio thing installed in their car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people already have that.</v>

158
00:07:16.221 --> 00:07:17.420
<v Speaker 1>Jack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

159
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.880
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so God damn easy and I get.</v>

160
00:07:19.881 --> 00:07:22.220
<v Speaker 1>I bet you could get all the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>sponsors.</v>

161
00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:25.520
<v Speaker 1>I bet you could get all the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>sponsors and you would have no middleman</v>

162
00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:27.670
<v Speaker 1>and you don't look at the studio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

163
00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.480
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't take much to put something</v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

164
00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:30.830
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of time,</v>

165
00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.180
<v Speaker 1>little bit of effort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

166
00:07:32.181 --> 00:07:34.940
<v Speaker 1>you gotta know someone who's an engineer</v>
<v Speaker 1>and knows someone who knows how to put</v>

167
00:07:34.941 --> 00:07:37.100
<v Speaker 1>this stuff together and set up the</v>
<v Speaker 1>microphones.</v>

168
00:07:37.101 --> 00:07:39.740
<v Speaker 1>But other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the difference between this and</v>

169
00:07:39.741 --> 00:07:41.300
<v Speaker 1>satellite radio?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you what,</v>

170
00:07:41.301 --> 00:07:43.400
<v Speaker 1>the differences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody can fucking fire you.</v>

171
00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:48.860
<v Speaker 1>You can go on some con rampage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that fucking animal and no one,</v>

172
00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:49.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people might say,</v>

173
00:07:49.851 --> 00:07:51.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm not downloading your podcasts</v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore,</v>

174
00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:55.010
<v Speaker 1>but at least you have the opportunity to</v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate,</v>

175
00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:58.280
<v Speaker 1>to explain yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if the people decide that they don't</v>

176
00:07:58.281 --> 00:08:02.390
<v Speaker 1>like your character based on one thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you said or one rant that you went</v>

177
00:08:02.391 --> 00:08:03.710
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is their decision,</v>

178
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:05.630
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the decision of a company.</v>

179
00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.100
<v Speaker 1>And when things get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

180
00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:09.020
<v Speaker 1>companies are squirrely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

181
00:08:09.021 --> 00:08:13.370
<v Speaker 1>they have fucking shareholders and</v>
<v Speaker 1>stocks and they have responsibilities</v>

182
00:08:13.371 --> 00:08:18.290
<v Speaker 1>and all you need is a few slash that</v>
<v Speaker 1>start webpages and you know,</v>

183
00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:21.950
<v Speaker 1>fire anthony and Anthony can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were going after those sponsors,</v>

184
00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.900
<v Speaker 1>we're going to let them know we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>boycotting,</v>

185
00:08:23.901 --> 00:08:26.930
<v Speaker 1>but mostly just noise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly nonsense.</v>

186
00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:30.950
<v Speaker 1>Mostly just soft targets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But all you need is a few of those in up</v>

187
00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:33.980
<v Speaker 1>a fucking accompany will panic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do.</v>

188
00:08:33.981 --> 00:08:34.820
<v Speaker 1>What happens is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

189
00:08:34.821 --> 00:08:39.620
<v Speaker 1>it's a billion dollar company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you get guys like Scott and Jim who</v>

190
00:08:39.621 --> 00:08:40.850
<v Speaker 1>runs it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

191
00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:42.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just the fourth of July weekend</v>

192
00:08:42.411 --> 00:08:46.250
<v Speaker 1>was coming and then all of a sudden</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're getting phone calls from the New</v>

193
00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:50.300
<v Speaker 1>York Post and the Washington Post and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the press obviously has a narrative</v>

194
00:08:50.301 --> 00:08:53.090
<v Speaker 1>and they did a shit job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the Washington Post I thought was</v>

195
00:08:53.091 --> 00:08:55.500
<v Speaker 1>the worst defender with the way they</v>
<v Speaker 1>covered it because the woman wrote</v>

196
00:08:55.501 --> 00:08:56.130
<v Speaker 1>things that was just</v>

197
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:58.380
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was revolting to read what she wrote.</v>

198
00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:03.690
<v Speaker 2>She was talking about Anthony saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>that these guys came around and she was</v>

199
00:09:03.691 --> 00:09:04.770
<v Speaker 2>saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

200
00:09:04.771 --> 00:09:06.710
<v Speaker 2>well I guess if a bunch of African</v>
<v Speaker 2>American or how was.</v>

201
00:09:06.711 --> 00:09:08.670
<v Speaker 2>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of gentlemen want to defend</v>

202
00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:11.220
<v Speaker 2>someone from defaming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an African American woman.</v>

203
00:09:11.221 --> 00:09:12.810
<v Speaker 2>It's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's what was happening.</v>

204
00:09:12.811 --> 00:09:14.640
<v Speaker 2>She wasn't acknowledging that Anthony</v>
<v Speaker 2>was being hit.</v>

205
00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:18.340
<v Speaker 2>She acted like these guys had read his</v>
<v Speaker 2>twitter feed and not like it.</v>

206
00:09:18.341 --> 00:09:21.240
<v Speaker 2>It was just like she read the twitter</v>
<v Speaker 2>feed in the future.</v>

207
00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:23.910
<v Speaker 2>It was repulsive on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A woman who looks like the fucking fake</v>

208
00:09:23.911 --> 00:09:27.300
<v Speaker 2>deaf interpreter from Mandela's funeral</v>
<v Speaker 2>meeting on Anthony.</v>

209
00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:32.790
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a meme,</v>

210
00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:34.470
<v Speaker 2>a meme.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's rules,</v>

211
00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.820
<v Speaker 2>but the company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these guys just getting,</v>

212
00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:38.190
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden they're just there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're harming.</v>

213
00:09:38.191 --> 00:09:40.230
<v Speaker 2>They're getting phone calls in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>office the day before vacation.</v>

214
00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:42.780
<v Speaker 2>So what are your comments?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they probably weren't even that</v>

215
00:09:42.781 --> 00:09:44.820
<v Speaker 2>familiar with it until they're getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>calls from the paper and they're like,</v>

216
00:09:44.821 --> 00:09:45.780
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do we do with this?</v>

217
00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:48.930
<v Speaker 2>And then this is what the press does and</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is why you got to hate that.</v>

218
00:09:48.931 --> 00:09:50.790
<v Speaker 2>Because I think Sirius was going to try</v>
<v Speaker 2>to write it out,</v>

219
00:09:50.791 --> 00:09:53.310
<v Speaker 2>that's my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they knew a holiday weekend was</v>

220
00:09:53.311 --> 00:09:56.910
<v Speaker 2>coming and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is purely a guess because no one</v>

221
00:09:56.911 --> 00:09:59.850
<v Speaker 2>was saying anything and then all of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sudden the press starts going,</v>

222
00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:02.100
<v Speaker 2>we have not had a comment from Sirius</v>
<v Speaker 2>satellite radio.</v>

223
00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.680
<v Speaker 2>So we're assuming that they agree with</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mr [inaudible] opinions.</v>

224
00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:09.360
<v Speaker 2>They do this sneaky shit to push you</v>
<v Speaker 2>into defending yourself.</v>

225
00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.820
<v Speaker 2>So now the company with shareholders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>

226
00:10:11.821 --> 00:10:12.331
<v Speaker 2>it has to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

227
00:10:12.331 --> 00:10:14.170
<v Speaker 2>how do we tell people that we don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>agree with?</v>

228
00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:18.210
<v Speaker 2>So it's not like the presses the made</v>
<v Speaker 2>them do it,</v>

229
00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:23.280
<v Speaker 2>but the press understands how to corner</v>
<v Speaker 2>you into giving a statement,</v>

230
00:10:23.281 --> 00:10:26.040
<v Speaker 2>a definitive statement because they know</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're not used to this.</v>

231
00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:30.090
<v Speaker 2>They know that these guys come into work</v>
<v Speaker 2>in management positions are not used to</v>

232
00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:33.000
<v Speaker 2>getting phone calls going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you feel about this statement and</v>

233
00:10:33.001 --> 00:10:34.110
<v Speaker 2>that statement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

234
00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:37.710
<v Speaker 2>it was really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a very frustrating thing when I</v>

235
00:10:37.711 --> 00:10:40.530
<v Speaker 2>saw what the press did with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That to me has always been my biggest</v>

236
00:10:40.531 --> 00:10:42.460
<v Speaker 2>complaint is with always will press</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

237
00:10:42.461 --> 00:10:42.680
<v Speaker 2>There's</v>

238
00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:47.270
<v Speaker 1>no nuance to the way they report on</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain things like this because</v>

239
00:10:47.271 --> 00:10:48.860
<v Speaker 1>there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nuance to this,</v>

240
00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:50.780
<v Speaker 1>especially if you look into it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>character,</v>

241
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.550
<v Speaker 1>if you in context where either if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand that guy and you look at him,</v>

242
00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:58.670
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a problem with violence in the</v>

243
00:10:58.671 --> 00:11:02.420
<v Speaker 1>black community to pretend there's not a</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem with violence in the black</v>

244
00:11:02.421 --> 00:11:06.410
<v Speaker 1>community is to pretend that there</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't insane amounts of murders going</v>

245
00:11:06.411 --> 00:11:11.030
<v Speaker 1>on in Chicago to pretend that there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not issues with the amount of black</v>

246
00:11:11.031 --> 00:11:13.760
<v Speaker 1>people that are in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That percentage of the population now</v>

247
00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:17.840
<v Speaker 1>are those economic problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are those problems related to</v>

248
00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:19.300
<v Speaker 1>upbringing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are those pro?</v>

249
00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:20.330
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Education?</v>

250
00:11:20.331 --> 00:11:21.380
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

251
00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:24.200
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of fucking disparity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of problems with poverty.</v>

252
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:27.680
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of problems with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure of our culture itself and that</v>

253
00:11:27.681 --> 00:11:29.990
<v Speaker 1>you could attribute a lot of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems to racism,</v>

254
00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:33.680
<v Speaker 1>to racism in the way that funds are</v>
<v Speaker 1>allocated.</v>

255
00:11:33.681 --> 00:11:37.820
<v Speaker 1>The way that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the attention that society puts on</v>

256
00:11:37.821 --> 00:11:40.100
<v Speaker 1>impoverished communities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely institutionalized,</v>

257
00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:42.950
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to pretend that it's not a problem</v>

258
00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.890
<v Speaker 1>is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking ridiculous.</v>

259
00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:49.940
<v Speaker 1>So when he's taking a picture of some</v>
<v Speaker 1>chick and she starts punching him,</v>

260
00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:54.100
<v Speaker 1>I think he's allowed to talk about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem with violence,</v>

261
00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:57.670
<v Speaker 2>with that community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the community that this person is</v>

262
00:11:57.671 --> 00:11:58.960
<v Speaker 2>from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's beating him up.</v>

263
00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:00.940
<v Speaker 2>Did he do it the right way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

264
00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:03.070
<v Speaker 2>absolutely not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did he do it in a way that could be</v>

265
00:12:03.071 --> 00:12:06.100
<v Speaker 2>misconstrued or construed or interpreted</v>
<v Speaker 2>as racist?</v>

266
00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:07.690
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

267
00:12:07.691 --> 00:12:08.680
<v Speaker 2>He did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He fucked up.</v>

268
00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:11.140
<v Speaker 2>He did it the wrong way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He probably shouldn't have done it on</v>

269
00:12:11.141 --> 00:12:12.730
<v Speaker 2>twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He published it and made a video.</v>

270
00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:14.950
<v Speaker 2>It probably should've made a video</v>
<v Speaker 2>explaining,</v>

271
00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:19.030
<v Speaker 2>showing what happened to him and</v>
<v Speaker 2>explaining what goes on.</v>

272
00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:24.180
<v Speaker 2>Explaining this 140 fucking characters</v>
<v Speaker 2>things is a big part of the problem.</v>

273
00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:25.801
<v Speaker 2>Do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

274
00:12:25.801 --> 00:12:29.710
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because Anthony is so good at,</v>

275
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:31.780
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clarify whatever you talk about race or</v>

276
00:12:31.781 --> 00:12:33.090
<v Speaker 2>a million other things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's religion,</v>

277
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:37.780
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so hard to make your point without</v>

278
00:12:37.781 --> 00:12:40.900
<v Speaker 2>stepping in shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then having to go off on 50 a</v>

279
00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:41.853
<v Speaker 2>digression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go,</v>

280
00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:42.601
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not what I meant,</v>

281
00:12:42.601 --> 00:12:43.570
<v Speaker 2>or no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not what I meant like in.</v>

282
00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:46.530
<v Speaker 2>That's the worst part of the disgusting</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff is that people jumping on this</v>

283
00:12:46.531 --> 00:12:48.470
<v Speaker 2>side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you saying that all people do?</v>

284
00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:49.330
<v Speaker 2>All black.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

285
00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:51.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in order to be able to,</v>

286
00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:53.860
<v Speaker 2>to get your point across,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to walk a narrow.</v>

287
00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:59.020
<v Speaker 2>You almost have to close people's</v>
<v Speaker 2>argument doors like a get smart episode</v>

288
00:12:59.021 --> 00:13:01.930
<v Speaker 2>as you're walking this way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your point gets through.</v>

289
00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:07.380
<v Speaker 2>And Anthony is a genius at doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a genius at it because we've debated</v>

290
00:13:07.931 --> 00:13:09.750
<v Speaker 2>race so many times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

291
00:13:09.751 --> 00:13:11.530
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the show at him and Patrice,</v>

292
00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:14.890
<v Speaker 2>we'd go back and forth and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Patrice loved Anthony because he</v>

293
00:13:14.891 --> 00:13:16.460
<v Speaker 2>said Anthony is an adorable racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

294
00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:20.320
<v Speaker 2>Patrice was so funny when he never knew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never was upset by Anthony's opinions</v>

295
00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:22.900
<v Speaker 2>because Anthony would listen to him and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would go back and forth.</v>

296
00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:26.140
<v Speaker 2>Half The Times Patrice was right and</v>
<v Speaker 2>half the time anthony was right.</v>

297
00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:29.860
<v Speaker 2>But on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think like in that emotion when you're</v>

298
00:13:29.861 --> 00:13:30.910
<v Speaker 2>saying x,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Y,</v>

299
00:13:30.911 --> 00:13:31.910
<v Speaker 2>and Z,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

300
00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:36.610
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he did as good a job as he</v>
<v Speaker 2>should have done of closing those doors</v>

301
00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:39.820
<v Speaker 2>behind him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost like sealing off things that</v>

302
00:13:39.821 --> 00:13:43.990
<v Speaker 2>people can get to you on because he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>so upset because he had had a physical</v>

303
00:13:43.991 --> 00:13:45.730
<v Speaker 2>assault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I know it sounds like I'm talking in</v>

304
00:13:45.731 --> 00:13:49.510
<v Speaker 2>circles and just defending my friend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've been with him for 10 years all</v>

305
00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:53.230
<v Speaker 2>in this medium of totally uncensored.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm telling you,</v>

306
00:13:53.231 --> 00:13:55.390
<v Speaker 2>I know him well enough to know that he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

307
00:13:55.391 --> 00:13:58.780
<v Speaker 2>he's got weird things where he'll talk</v>
<v Speaker 2>about race and people misinterpret them</v>

308
00:13:58.781 --> 00:14:02.080
<v Speaker 2>and I've talked to him privately and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy does not hate black people and I</v>

309
00:14:02.081 --> 00:14:04.180
<v Speaker 2>know that that's just all his friends</v>
<v Speaker 2>defending him.</v>

310
00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.700
<v Speaker 2>But I'm telling you that he does not</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I know him well.</v>

311
00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:08.980
<v Speaker 2>And then to hear people going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he hates black people.</v>

312
00:14:08.981 --> 00:14:13.981
<v Speaker 2>It's like he's not afraid of being</v>
<v Speaker 2>misconstrued or interpreted as racist.</v>

313
00:14:15.131 --> 00:14:19.390
<v Speaker 2>He's not afraid of it by saying what he</v>
<v Speaker 2>really believes is his opinion about</v>

314
00:14:19.391 --> 00:14:22.780
<v Speaker 2>certain aspects of a group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever race,</v>

315
00:14:22.781 --> 00:14:23.381
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gender,</v>

316
00:14:23.381 --> 00:14:26.200
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not afraid of speaking his mind</v>

317
00:14:26.201 --> 00:14:28.420
<v Speaker 2>about things because he's got them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you money.</v>

318
00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:30.880
<v Speaker 2>That's a big part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's got 150,000 guns.</v>

319
00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:32.870
<v Speaker 2>Those are the two things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

320
00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:37.300
<v Speaker 2>a big part of it that drove me fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy is people are not,</v>

321
00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:40.480
<v Speaker 2>they're not taking into account the</v>
<v Speaker 2>reaction that someone has when they get</v>

322
00:14:40.481 --> 00:14:42.730
<v Speaker 2>assaulted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because when you get hit by someone,</v>

323
00:14:42.731 --> 00:14:44.290
<v Speaker 2>some fucking stranger that you don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

324
00:14:44.291 --> 00:14:47.890
<v Speaker 2>hits you as.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially when you've got a garden,</v>

325
00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:50.890
<v Speaker 2>you've got a fucking bullet</v>

326
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:54.800
<v Speaker 1>gun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got a thing inside you that has</v>

327
00:14:54.801 --> 00:14:57.560
<v Speaker 1>explosions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you press a trigger,</v>

328
00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:02.030
<v Speaker 1>explosions propel bullets and they end</v>
<v Speaker 1>lives instantly.</v>

329
00:15:02.031 --> 00:15:06.020
<v Speaker 1>And Anthony's an expert with one and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>has it on him at all times and he's</v>

330
00:15:06.021 --> 00:15:09.110
<v Speaker 1>getting hit and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

331
00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:11.930
<v Speaker 1>And so he gets on my fucking animal con</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitch,</v>

332
00:15:11.931 --> 00:15:14.300
<v Speaker 1>fuck you this back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

333
00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:17.960
<v Speaker 1>it's getting hit is a very disturbing</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

334
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:19.100
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

335
00:15:19.101 --> 00:15:22.730
<v Speaker 1>there's one thing to get hit and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting hit in a sparring session is</v>

336
00:15:22.731 --> 00:15:24.550
<v Speaker 1>infuriating with people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

337
00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:28.310
<v Speaker 1>I've seen people go fucking crazy</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they get choked out in a Jujitsu</v>

338
00:15:28.311 --> 00:15:31.040
<v Speaker 1>session,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting punched his way more traumatic,</v>

339
00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:35.480
<v Speaker 1>getting punched by a stranger multiple</v>
<v Speaker 1>times for taking a fucking photograph.</v>

340
00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:38.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the exchange was</v>
<v Speaker 1>between the two of them.</v>

341
00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:42.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he was saying something that was</v>

342
00:15:42.891 --> 00:15:44.170
<v Speaker 1>infuriating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

343
00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:45.380
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

344
00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:47.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm not gonna pretend that was there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but man,</v>

345
00:15:47.241 --> 00:15:50.750
<v Speaker 1>you've got to take into account the</v>
<v Speaker 1>reaction that people have when you hit</v>

346
00:15:50.751 --> 00:15:52.520
<v Speaker 1>them and it to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

347
00:15:52.521 --> 00:15:57.290
<v Speaker 1>I hate to keep going back to the press,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't focus on the fact that</v>

348
00:15:57.291 --> 00:15:59.600
<v Speaker 1>he like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he handled himself properly in that</v>

349
00:15:59.601 --> 00:16:01.370
<v Speaker 1>because I know I would have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I would have pulled the</v>

350
00:16:01.371 --> 00:16:03.260
<v Speaker 1>gun in that moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm a panicky pete,</v>

351
00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:05.720
<v Speaker 1>that I would have just what other guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>were coming over.</v>

352
00:16:05.721 --> 00:16:09.530
<v Speaker 1>I would have at least brandished it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he acted physically responsible,</v>

353
00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:10.670
<v Speaker 1>like as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>

354
00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:14.660
<v Speaker 1>as a fucking guy with a pistol on him</v>
<v Speaker 1>because people get shot all the time for</v>

355
00:16:14.661 --> 00:16:17.330
<v Speaker 1>dumb arguments and dumb things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

356
00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:20.660
<v Speaker 1>he handled himself absolutely right and</v>
<v Speaker 1>lost his cool.</v>

357
00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:24.080
<v Speaker 1>Once he got home and people didn't take</v>
<v Speaker 1>the press,</v>

358
00:16:24.081 --> 00:16:24.980
<v Speaker 1>didn't take that into account.</v>

359
00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:28.310
<v Speaker 1>They harped on the fact that he didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>get a police report and I wished he had.</v>

360
00:16:28.311 --> 00:16:29.270
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in hindsight,</v>

361
00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:31.760
<v Speaker 1>because they're all going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr Colby did I get a police report,</v>

362
00:16:31.761 --> 00:16:34.160
<v Speaker 1>but here's the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Had he gotten a police report,</v>

363
00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:36.620
<v Speaker 1>they would have just ignored it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't have said,</v>

364
00:16:36.621 --> 00:16:38.120
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least he got a police report.</v>

365
00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:40.070
<v Speaker 1>They would have glanced over the fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then said,</v>

366
00:16:40.071 --> 00:16:41.390
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I can get a police report.</v>

367
00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:44.600
<v Speaker 1>So they were just using that as a reason</v>
<v Speaker 1>to kind of ignore the fact that he got</v>

368
00:16:44.601 --> 00:16:45.020
<v Speaker 1>hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

369
00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:48.800
<v Speaker 1>we didn't see a police report.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the press harped on the fact that he</v>

370
00:16:48.801 --> 00:16:51.350
<v Speaker 1>didn't get a police report,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but answer response was,</v>

371
00:16:51.351 --> 00:16:52.340
<v Speaker 1>look man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

372
00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:56.950
<v Speaker 1>I know enough to know that me getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>hit by some lady in Times Square is not</v>

373
00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:59.720
<v Speaker 1>a fucking priority for NYP ed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's worried about terrorists.</v>

374
00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:01.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially if he's fine.</v>

375
00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:04.760
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a real issue also with</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the press,</v>

376
00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:07.190
<v Speaker 1>with a lot of people in the press,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll clarify that.</v>

377
00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:11.600
<v Speaker 1>What they're trying to do is they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to close those getsmart doors as</v>

378
00:17:11.601 --> 00:17:14.210
<v Speaker 1>they write a piece as well and as</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're writing a piece,</v>

379
00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:19.310
<v Speaker 1>they are also trying to placate all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are going to be up in arms</v>

380
00:17:19.311 --> 00:17:22.160
<v Speaker 1>about their opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they could possibly be supporting a</v>

381
00:17:22.161 --> 00:17:24.660
<v Speaker 1>racist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they could possibly be taking your</v>

382
00:17:24.661 --> 00:17:26.060
<v Speaker 1>side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeing with him,</v>

383
00:17:26.061 --> 00:17:29.990
<v Speaker 1>seeing his point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can be misinterpreted or they could</v>

384
00:17:29.991 --> 00:17:33.740
<v Speaker 1>be interpreted as being racist as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they have to worry about that as</v>

385
00:17:33.741 --> 00:17:36.320
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you're with a liberal rag.</v>

386
00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:38.270
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have a very liberal newspaper</v>

387
00:17:38.271 --> 00:17:40.580
<v Speaker 1>that you work for and they have a clear</v>
<v Speaker 1>agenda,</v>

388
00:17:40.581 --> 00:17:42.530
<v Speaker 1>which a lot of them do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Washington Times does,</v>

389
00:17:42.531 --> 00:17:44.510
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll watch the Washington Post rose.</v>

390
00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:49.070
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of them that have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>liberal slant and if you are reporting</v>

391
00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:49.980
<v Speaker 1>for them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

392
00:17:49.981 --> 00:17:53.520
<v Speaker 1>and it's something like this that's very</v>
<v Speaker 1>controversial and something where</v>

393
00:17:53.521 --> 00:17:55.020
<v Speaker 1>there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of things that</v>

394
00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:58.590
<v Speaker 1>automatically have like a knee jerk</v>
<v Speaker 1>reaction to them and this is one of them</v>

395
00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:02.340
<v Speaker 1>knee jerk reaction to what's conceived</v>
<v Speaker 1>as racist perceived as race.</v>

396
00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:04.230
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And another thing that they do that's</v>

397
00:18:04.231 --> 00:18:08.790
<v Speaker 2>even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's even more enraging is what people</v>

398
00:18:08.791 --> 00:18:13.080
<v Speaker 2>who write for the press now have to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>is not just reporting what happened.</v>

399
00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:17.370
<v Speaker 2>It's how do I editorialize under the</v>
<v Speaker 2>guise of being impartial.</v>

400
00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:20.230
<v Speaker 2>And they do that a lot too and that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't like either.</v>

401
00:18:20.231 --> 00:18:23.400
<v Speaker 2>It's like that to me is the worst crime</v>
<v Speaker 2>they commit actually if the</v>

402
00:18:23.401 --> 00:18:27.810
<v Speaker 2>editorializing as they're going along.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's legitimate.</v>

403
00:18:27.811 --> 00:18:31.050
<v Speaker 2>Like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like NBC and I'm on a Zimmerman Fan.</v>

404
00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:32.650
<v Speaker 2>Either aunt was a big supporter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Zimmerman,</v>

405
00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:34.980
<v Speaker 2>I thought Zimmerman should have went to</v>
<v Speaker 2>jail for something.</v>

406
00:18:34.981 --> 00:18:37.140
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what legally I have no</v>
<v Speaker 2>ground to stand on,</v>

407
00:18:37.141 --> 00:18:39.420
<v Speaker 2>but I kind of thought he was a con.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

408
00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:41.520
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not a guy who was out to commit a</v>

409
00:18:41.521 --> 00:18:43.350
<v Speaker 2>murder either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought there was a line in between,</v>

410
00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:45.750
<v Speaker 2>but whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like NBC edited that tape,</v>

411
00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:47.340
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

412
00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:50.610
<v Speaker 2>can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no reason to do that unless</v>

413
00:18:50.611 --> 00:18:53.400
<v Speaker 2>you're pushing something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're doing it under the guise of</v>

414
00:18:53.401 --> 00:18:56.040
<v Speaker 2>being impartial and I'm sure they've</v>
<v Speaker 2>done it plenty of times to vilify</v>

415
00:18:56.041 --> 00:18:57.160
<v Speaker 2>blacks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying they have it.</v>

416
00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:58.590
<v Speaker 1>He lost that lawsuit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

417
00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:00.720
<v Speaker 1>I know he did on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

418
00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:03.300
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why the news has such a</v>

419
00:19:03.301 --> 00:19:06.660
<v Speaker 1>different level of what they can get</v>
<v Speaker 1>away with and what they can do because</v>

420
00:19:06.661 --> 00:19:09.120
<v Speaker 1>they're seen as doing a public service.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In my opinion though,</v>

421
00:19:09.121 --> 00:19:12.090
<v Speaker 1>I think they lost it because everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>was hating that guy and they just didn't</v>

422
00:19:12.091 --> 00:19:14.280
<v Speaker 1>want him to win something on top of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

423
00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:16.770
<v Speaker 1>The fact that he still has his freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The kid lost his life.</v>

424
00:19:16.771 --> 00:19:18.510
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's us.</v>

425
00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:20.850
<v Speaker 1>I think he's a sucky fucking security</v>
<v Speaker 1>guard.</v>

426
00:19:20.851 --> 00:19:21.684
<v Speaker 1>That's what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

427
00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:25.560
<v Speaker 1>I think if you're going to look at that</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy and find fault and what he did,</v>

428
00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:28.830
<v Speaker 1>it's how did he handle the situation and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a more confident,</v>

429
00:19:28.831 --> 00:19:30.630
<v Speaker 1>competent person have handled it the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same way.</v>

430
00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:32.760
<v Speaker 1>Like here's a perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My friend,</v>

431
00:19:32.761 --> 00:19:34.260
<v Speaker 1>big John Mccarthy who was a cop.</v>

432
00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:36.630
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the referee.</v>

433
00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:37.641
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

434
00:19:37.641 --> 00:19:38.490
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You referenced caught.</v>

435
00:19:38.491 --> 00:19:41.310
<v Speaker 1>That guy was a cop for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but great guy.</v>

436
00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:43.700
<v Speaker 1>But he knows how to handle shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

437
00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:46.620
<v Speaker 1>if big John Mccarthy saw that kid</v>
<v Speaker 1>walking in the neighborhood,</v>

438
00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:48.210
<v Speaker 1>he probably would've said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you doing man?</v>

439
00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:49.360
<v Speaker 1>Everything cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

440
00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:52.050
<v Speaker 1>had a conversation with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything would've been fine.</v>

441
00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:55.680
<v Speaker 1>Like even if the kid got up in arms or</v>
<v Speaker 1>got mouthy with him,</v>

442
00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:58.140
<v Speaker 1>he would have probably calmed him down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

443
00:19:58.141 --> 00:20:00.450
<v Speaker 1>without having to get into some physical</v>
<v Speaker 1>altercation.</v>

444
00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:03.270
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kid wouldn't have been able to mount</v>

445
00:20:03.271 --> 00:20:05.760
<v Speaker 1>them and bash his fucking head off the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ground because he's physically</v>

446
00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:06.603
<v Speaker 1>incompetent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

447
00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:08.850
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to fucking could patrol</v>
<v Speaker 1>a neighborhood,</v>

448
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.040
<v Speaker 1>you can't do it just with a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can't be.</v>

449
00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:14.580
<v Speaker 1>You can't have the only.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The last resort is your only resort.</v>

450
00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:17.430
<v Speaker 1>You key can't physically defend himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's out of shape.</v>

451
00:20:17.431 --> 00:20:21.570
<v Speaker 1>He's soft and doughy and he's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>physically able to hold that guy off,</v>

452
00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:24.930
<v Speaker 1>but yet he's put himself in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>position where he's like a security.</v>

453
00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:28.650
<v Speaker 1>He's the force of the truth of the law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that,</v>

454
00:20:28.651 --> 00:20:31.050
<v Speaker 1>you know you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not qualified for that job.</v>

455
00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:33.390
<v Speaker 1>He's just not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when that kids on top of them</v>

456
00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:36.330
<v Speaker 1>bouncing his fucking head off the curb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

457
00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:41.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't see any way out for him other</v>
<v Speaker 1>than using a weapon right when that kid</v>

458
00:20:41.141 --> 00:20:43.920
<v Speaker 1>is beating the shit out of him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he should have never gotten to that</v>

459
00:20:43.921 --> 00:20:45.130
<v Speaker 1>position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He shouldn't have.</v>

460
00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:47.470
<v Speaker 1>It should have never escalated to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You tell me.</v>

461
00:20:47.471 --> 00:20:51.550
<v Speaker 1>The only way to people can communicate</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that is it comes into violence.</v>

462
00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:52.390
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

463
00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:54.850
<v Speaker 1>it's how do you deal with it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you communicate?</v>

464
00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:58.420
<v Speaker 1>How did you address this person?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did you say when he talked back to</v>

465
00:20:58.421 --> 00:20:59.620
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did you say?</v>

466
00:20:59.621 --> 00:21:01.540
<v Speaker 1>What was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What were the exchange of words?</v>

467
00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:02.673
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when those,</v>

468
00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:04.630
<v Speaker 1>those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a big difference between.</v>

469
00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:06.640
<v Speaker 1>There's a video that we played the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

470
00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:10.030
<v Speaker 1>What was the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you even lift bro?</v>

471
00:21:10.031 --> 00:21:12.370
<v Speaker 1>You ever see that guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Russian guy?</v>

472
00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:13.263
<v Speaker 1>Is He Russian?</v>

473
00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:15.590
<v Speaker 3>There's even a worse one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's practice.</v>

474
00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:19.570
<v Speaker 3>The Pakistani kids though in New York</v>
<v Speaker 3>where the Bronx,</v>

475
00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.460
<v Speaker 3>the police chief and Bronx,</v>
<v Speaker 3>New York was like,</v>

476
00:21:21.461 --> 00:21:23.560
<v Speaker 3>stop doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to get killed.</v>

477
00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:26.960
<v Speaker 3>That like these two kids that just go on</v>
<v Speaker 3>youtube and they go up to people in</v>

478
00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:29.050
<v Speaker 3>horrible neighborhoods and are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

479
00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:32.560
<v Speaker 3>you got a problem while he's holding a</v>
<v Speaker 3>calculator and he's just trying to be</v>

480
00:21:32.561 --> 00:21:34.420
<v Speaker 3>funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but these guys are just bashing their</v>

481
00:21:34.421 --> 00:21:37.720
<v Speaker 3>heads in and stuff and so the bronx</v>
<v Speaker 3>chief police or something like that</v>

482
00:21:37.721 --> 00:21:38.171
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

483
00:21:38.171 --> 00:21:40.090
<v Speaker 3>stop it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yet these videos more pop.</v>

484
00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:43.630
<v Speaker 1>My point is if you watch those videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy,</v>

485
00:21:43.631 --> 00:21:46.150
<v Speaker 1>he comes up to people that like look</v>
<v Speaker 1>like your workout and goes,</v>

486
00:21:46.151 --> 00:21:47.740
<v Speaker 1>do you even lift bro?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look how small you are,</v>

487
00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:50.890
<v Speaker 1>and some people handle it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

488
00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:52.930
<v Speaker 1>Some people go like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

489
00:21:52.931 --> 00:21:54.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't even don't pull it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't need to see it.</v>

490
00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:55.990
<v Speaker 1>Some people go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

491
00:21:55.991 --> 00:21:57.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't even lift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

492
00:21:57.551 --> 00:22:00.730
<v Speaker 1>I guess I'm small and then they laugh</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they walk away and some people like</v>

493
00:22:00.731 --> 00:22:04.750
<v Speaker 1>threatened them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it depends entirely on how do</v>

494
00:22:04.751 --> 00:22:08.950
<v Speaker 1>people interact with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's what we don't know</v>

495
00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:12.220
<v Speaker 1>about the anthony situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what we don't know about the</v>

496
00:22:12.221 --> 00:22:15.790
<v Speaker 1>Zimmerman situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just about what went down,</v>

497
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.900
<v Speaker 1>it's about how did it all play out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how could it have been avoided?</v>

498
00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:23.160
<v Speaker 2>There's little subtleties in language</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when Jonah Hill is apologizing</v>

499
00:22:23.161 --> 00:22:24.200
<v Speaker 2>recently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

500
00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:25.920
<v Speaker 2>and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's obviously not a homophobe.</v>

501
00:22:25.921 --> 00:22:27.270
<v Speaker 2>We just got mad and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>suck my Dick,</v>

502
00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:28.860
<v Speaker 2>faggot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a stupid thing in a moment.</v>

503
00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:30.330
<v Speaker 2>And he's said the tonight show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

504
00:22:30.331 --> 00:22:32.670
<v Speaker 2>he's just apologizing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he never had to deal with</v>

505
00:22:32.671 --> 00:22:34.260
<v Speaker 2>something like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said something.</v>

506
00:22:34.261 --> 00:22:35.790
<v Speaker 2>He goes back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the intent doesn't matter,</v>

507
00:22:35.791 --> 00:22:37.140
<v Speaker 2>it's the word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the words.</v>

508
00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:38.491
<v Speaker 2>And it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

509
00:22:38.491 --> 00:22:41.490
<v Speaker 2>I know you're on the spot in that moment</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not going to crucify the guy,</v>

510
00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:44.460
<v Speaker 2>but I wish I was there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I could just appear on the seat next</v>

511
00:22:44.461 --> 00:22:45.660
<v Speaker 2>to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like in that woody Allen scene,</v>

512
00:22:45.661 --> 00:22:47.800
<v Speaker 2>when the guy walks out to correct a guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>online and go,</v>

513
00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:49.140
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the intent is everything.</v>

514
00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:52.920
<v Speaker 2>Because if the words matter the next</v>
<v Speaker 2>time somebody said the fucking giants</v>

515
00:22:52.921 --> 00:22:55.230
<v Speaker 2>killed the jets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while we better call the police.</v>

516
00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:56.333
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

517
00:22:56.610 --> 00:22:58.380
<v Speaker 2>It's the intent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We understand every,</v>

518
00:22:58.381 --> 00:23:01.950
<v Speaker 2>every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every single interaction or phrase has</v>

519
00:23:01.951 --> 00:23:03.240
<v Speaker 2>an intent behind it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

520
00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:06.090
<v Speaker 2>which doesn't always come through in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>written word.</v>

521
00:23:06.091 --> 00:23:07.260
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an inflection.</v>

522
00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:10.640
<v Speaker 1>Something that you and I had a</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation about with the Tracy Morgan</v>

523
00:23:10.641 --> 00:23:15.641
<v Speaker 1>situation with people pretending that</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he was saying when he was on stage,</v>

524
00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:17.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he was going to stab a sign of</v>

525
00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:22.410
<v Speaker 2>like his whole act is filled with him</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying ridiculous shit.</v>

526
00:23:22.411 --> 00:23:23.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not a statement.</v>

527
00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:26.170
<v Speaker 2>It's not an affidavit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's making court.</v>

528
00:23:26.290 --> 00:23:28.300
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're taking it out of context because</v>

529
00:23:28.301 --> 00:23:29.890
<v Speaker 2>it's the soft target.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you do that,</v>

530
00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:31.750
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to stab my son because he's</v>

531
00:23:31.751 --> 00:23:34.430
<v Speaker 2>gay as a statement of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or at the,</v>

532
00:23:34.431 --> 00:23:37.900
<v Speaker 2>at the end of a political rally is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty awful thing to say,</v>

533
00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:41.290
<v Speaker 2>but if you've opened up with I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get you pregnant and I'm going to</v>

534
00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:44.620
<v Speaker 2>mold shit and make a hat out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of hard to take any one</v>

535
00:23:44.621 --> 00:23:46.670
<v Speaker 2>statement go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's the serious one,</v>

536
00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:49.610
<v Speaker 2>but that's again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's that purposely ignoring context</v>

537
00:23:49.611 --> 00:23:51.230
<v Speaker 2>or even when you can't ignore it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

538
00:23:51.231 --> 00:23:52.330
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we understand the context.</v>

539
00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:54.800
<v Speaker 2>We don't fucking care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just soft targets.</v>

540
00:23:54.801 --> 00:23:57.560
<v Speaker 2>People find soft targets and those</v>
<v Speaker 2>targets.</v>

541
00:23:57.561 --> 00:24:00.200
<v Speaker 2>Look if they're all ganging up on</v>
<v Speaker 2>anthony too.</v>

542
00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:02.630
<v Speaker 2>That's the other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying Boo Hoo Anthony.</v>

543
00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:04.220
<v Speaker 2>Let's pay attention to what's really</v>
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>

544
00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:07.820
<v Speaker 2>If you're writing an article out of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>blue for no reason about Jim Norton,</v>

545
00:24:08.050 --> 00:24:09.200
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're the only guy.</v>

546
00:24:09.201 --> 00:24:12.560
<v Speaker 2>I think Jim Norton is a despicable</v>
<v Speaker 2>person and you write this article,</v>

547
00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:15.410
<v Speaker 2>you have the option to respond to that</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can go,</v>

548
00:24:15.411 --> 00:24:16.580
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are you,</v>

549
00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:19.430
<v Speaker 2>Mr. reporter Dick Wad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's take a look at you,</v>

550
00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:21.680
<v Speaker 2>and then other people can take a look at</v>
<v Speaker 2>him too,</v>

551
00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:24.800
<v Speaker 2>but when everybody's piling on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a free for all.</v>

552
00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:28.400
<v Speaker 2>It's a free ride and then you're there</v>
<v Speaker 2>flailing wildly.</v>

553
00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:31.130
<v Speaker 2>All the Louis Louis ck actually raised a</v>
<v Speaker 2>really good point about that.</v>

554
00:24:31.131 --> 00:24:32.180
<v Speaker 2>When something has happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>

555
00:24:32.181 --> 00:24:33.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to remember to.</v>

556
00:24:33.111 --> 00:24:36.860
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's not googling you like</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone is not googling Joe Rogan or</v>

557
00:24:36.861 --> 00:24:41.390
<v Speaker 2>Jim Norton or Anthony Cool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like so you're seeing a every result</v>

558
00:24:41.391 --> 00:24:43.610
<v Speaker 2>about yourself and it appears</v>
<v Speaker 2>overwhelming,</v>

559
00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:47.810
<v Speaker 2>but the reality is like people may be</v>
<v Speaker 2>reading news day or the post or the</v>

560
00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:50.480
<v Speaker 2>Gawker or vice or whatever they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>reading,</v>

561
00:24:50.481 --> 00:24:54.830
<v Speaker 2>but they're not reading every single</v>
<v Speaker 2>article on Anthony Kumiai or on Jim</v>

562
00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:57.500
<v Speaker 2>Norton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's where the overwhelming thing</v>

563
00:24:57.501 --> 00:25:01.370
<v Speaker 2>is sometimes misleading because people</v>
<v Speaker 2>are all reading little snippets of it,</v>

564
00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:04.160
<v Speaker 2>but when the company is getting calls</v>
<v Speaker 2>from again,</v>

565
00:25:04.161 --> 00:25:07.970
<v Speaker 2>five or six different outlets to them it</v>
<v Speaker 2>feels overwhelming and like,</v>

566
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.320
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck do we do with this?</v>

567
00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:11.880
<v Speaker 2>Because this wasn't on the air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think that's where,</v>

568
00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:13.640
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they haven't discussed this with me,</v>

569
00:25:13.641 --> 00:25:16.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm purely speculating because to them,</v>

570
00:25:16.491 --> 00:25:17.990
<v Speaker 2>if it was on the air,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm guessing they would have said,</v>

571
00:25:17.991 --> 00:25:20.480
<v Speaker 2>well that's what he does on the air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they're not looking at it like,</v>

572
00:25:20.481 --> 00:25:22.040
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was reacting to being hit.</v>

573
00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:23.360
<v Speaker 2>I think they just were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

574
00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:24.610
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got a fire.</v>

575
00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:29.270
<v Speaker 2>I think that's why they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They kind of just reacted very quickly.</v>

576
00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:31.310
<v Speaker 2>I think they fuck themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really do.</v>

577
00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:34.310
<v Speaker 2>They fuck themselves because they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be the place where it was</v>

578
00:25:34.311 --> 00:25:36.530
<v Speaker 2>free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the wild place,</v>

579
00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:41.620
<v Speaker 2>but where the fibrous w was the virus</v>
<v Speaker 2>channel member now with Sirius Xm talk.</v>

580
00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:44.570
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sirius xm talk.</v>

581
00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:46.620
<v Speaker 2>We have to rename it but we don't know</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would they have?</v>

582
00:25:46.650 --> 00:25:48.200
<v Speaker 2>They have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not asking for my input.</v>

583
00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:49.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't want my name on the show like I</v>
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>

584
00:25:49.671 --> 00:25:50.790
<v Speaker 2>I want to be on the show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't,</v>

585
00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:51.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be open.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Jimmy,</v>

586
00:25:51.831 --> 00:25:54.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't people to feel like I'm jumping</v>
<v Speaker 2>into Anthony's seat because I'm not.</v>

587
00:25:55.790 --> 00:25:59.390
<v Speaker 2>If they call the OPI show a much more</v>
<v Speaker 2>happy with that because that's what it</v>

588
00:25:59.391 --> 00:26:01.370
<v Speaker 2>was before he met Anthony Columbia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would call it.</v>

589
00:26:01.371 --> 00:26:02.810
<v Speaker 2>We Miss Anthony.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

590
00:26:02.811 --> 00:26:04.700
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be kind of a or Tony will</v>

591
00:26:04.701 --> 00:26:06.280
<v Speaker 2>call it Tony so they don't know who</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking to.</v>

592
00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:11.900
<v Speaker 2>Bring where's Tony be sneaky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it is a horrible.</v>

593
00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:14.900
<v Speaker 2>And it's like people get mad at me and</v>
<v Speaker 2>opiod and say we don't.</v>

594
00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:18.110
<v Speaker 2>And I tried to say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we didn't mad at you for what?</v>

595
00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:18.941
<v Speaker 2>Because the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

596
00:26:18.941 --> 00:26:22.040
<v Speaker 2>they people think that we're like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of teenagers hanging out and like</v>

597
00:26:22.041 --> 00:26:25.100
<v Speaker 2>you guys should walk and support and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

598
00:26:25.101 --> 00:26:28.130
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you dumb mother fuckers that say that</v>

599
00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:33.120
<v Speaker 2>Anthony I've talked to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wouldn't walk and he told me you got</v>

600
00:26:33.121 --> 00:26:35.360
<v Speaker 2>to make your money like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's all a and B,</v>

601
00:26:35.361 --> 00:26:36.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm under contract.</v>

602
00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:38.750
<v Speaker 2>I can't just walk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have three more months in the</v>

603
00:26:38.751 --> 00:26:41.450
<v Speaker 2>contract.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And opie tried to clear this up on the</v>

604
00:26:41.451 --> 00:26:42.620
<v Speaker 2>air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if we just walk out,</v>

605
00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:46.530
<v Speaker 2>if they fire us and we just walk and say</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of more subs leave because they</v>

606
00:26:46.531 --> 00:26:47.161
<v Speaker 2>realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

607
00:26:47.161 --> 00:26:50.310
<v Speaker 2>the show really is gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then all of a sudden serious wants to</v>

608
00:26:50.311 --> 00:26:53.130
<v Speaker 2>take action on us for breach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a whole fucking legal.</v>

609
00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:56.580
<v Speaker 2>People just don't get that part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they think that we're fucking</v>

610
00:26:56.581 --> 00:26:57.211
<v Speaker 2>anthony.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

611
00:26:57.211 --> 00:26:59.130
<v Speaker 2>who doesn't think we're fucking Anthony</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anthony?</v>

612
00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:01.580
<v Speaker 2>He knows we're not fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Only an idiot thinks you're fucking</v>

613
00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:03.090
<v Speaker 2>anthony,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's always going to be idiots</v>

614
00:27:03.091 --> 00:27:05.910
<v Speaker 2>with opinions office.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm fine with that when people say</v>

615
00:27:05.911 --> 00:27:06.451
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

616
00:27:06.451 --> 00:27:09.690
<v Speaker 2>I love you and ob,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I got to cancel because I'm staying</v>

617
00:27:09.691 --> 00:27:11.430
<v Speaker 2>with Anthony.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't get mad at those people.</v>

618
00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:14.550
<v Speaker 2>Or if people like I'm going to keep</v>
<v Speaker 2>serious and I'm also going to listen to</v>

619
00:27:14.551 --> 00:27:15.840
<v Speaker 2>ant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't bog.</v>

620
00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:18.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm fine with that too because I get the</v>
<v Speaker 2>emotion,</v>

621
00:27:18.511 --> 00:27:21.870
<v Speaker 2>like whatever they got to do to support</v>
<v Speaker 2>and is cool with me,</v>

622
00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:25.050
<v Speaker 2>I want them to stay because my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my ideal world,</v>

623
00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:28.140
<v Speaker 2>they listen to me and opie and then they</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking listen to Anthony.</v>

624
00:27:28.141 --> 00:27:29.850
<v Speaker 2>There's no competition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to.</v>

625
00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:31.380
<v Speaker 2>We're not like here you don't mention</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anthony.</v>

626
00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:33.150
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to fucking show comes</v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

627
00:27:33.151 --> 00:27:35.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to tweet it because I want him</v>

628
00:27:35.071 --> 00:27:36.990
<v Speaker 2>to succeed because he's one of my</v>
<v Speaker 2>closest friends.</v>

629
00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:39.300
<v Speaker 2>It's gonna succeed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to.</v>

630
00:27:39.301 --> 00:27:40.170
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

631
00:27:40.171 --> 00:27:41.004
<v Speaker 2>just.</v>

632
00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:44.460
<v Speaker 1>He's an entertaining guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's an interesting guy in the platform</v>

633
00:27:44.461 --> 00:27:49.461
<v Speaker 1>of the Internet is so free and easy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's already got a full professional</v>

634
00:27:49.501 --> 00:27:50.740
<v Speaker 1>setup at his house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

635
00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:55.050
<v Speaker 1>People don't know if you've never seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the main reasons I started this</v>

636
00:27:55.051 --> 00:27:58.170
<v Speaker 1>podcast is because of live from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>compound,</v>

637
00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:01.110
<v Speaker 1>because he said a fucking greenscreen in</v>
<v Speaker 1>his house,</v>

638
00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:05.670
<v Speaker 1>a professional studio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was playing images behind him of</v>

639
00:28:05.671 --> 00:28:08.760
<v Speaker 1>like the city of La.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a green screen,</v>

640
00:28:08.761 --> 00:28:13.761
<v Speaker 1>I mean a beautiful green screen like</v>
<v Speaker 1>professional broadcast quality cameras,</v>

641
00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:15.420
<v Speaker 1>like the whole deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

642
00:28:15.421 --> 00:28:19.770
<v Speaker 1>that's amazing and that slowly but</v>
<v Speaker 1>surely led to what you're seeing right</v>

643
00:28:19.771 --> 00:28:23.190
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like him doing that while he was already</v>

644
00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:26.940
<v Speaker 1>on Sirius and Sirius tried to stop them</v>
<v Speaker 1>from doing that.</v>

645
00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:29.310
<v Speaker 1>They got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They gave him a hard time about that.</v>

646
00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:30.293
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

647
00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:32.460
<v Speaker 1>That was it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that was a contractual issue too</v>

648
00:28:32.461 --> 00:28:33.091
<v Speaker 1>where they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

649
00:28:33.091 --> 00:28:34.780
<v Speaker 1>this is the medium you're on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But eventually they're like,</v>

650
00:28:34.790 --> 00:28:36.000
<v Speaker 1>they're of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let them do it and they're like,</v>

651
00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:40.260
<v Speaker 1>what do you think is going to go down</v>
<v Speaker 1>September when your contract is up</v>

652
00:28:40.390 --> 00:28:41.680
<v Speaker 2>October fourth?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

653
00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:46.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean like I love the Gig,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love performing,</v>

654
00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:49.150
<v Speaker 2>but you love the Gig.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The same with Anthony not being there.</v>

655
00:28:49.270 --> 00:28:50.001
<v Speaker 2>Of course not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

656
00:28:50.001 --> 00:28:50.350
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

657
00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:53.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean the idea of performing either</v>
<v Speaker 2>alone or with other people.</v>

658
00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:56.680
<v Speaker 2>I want this thing to work because I want</v>
<v Speaker 2>my own thing.</v>

659
00:28:56.681 --> 00:28:58.850
<v Speaker 2>Like I've done so many things being the</v>
<v Speaker 2>vice thing,</v>

660
00:28:59.110 --> 00:29:01.840
<v Speaker 2>Jim Norton show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to have my own thing too,</v>

661
00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:04.630
<v Speaker 2>because you feel like a more complete</v>
<v Speaker 2>performer when you're not always with</v>

662
00:29:04.631 --> 00:29:08.560
<v Speaker 2>Opie and Anthony or Colin Quinn or Louis</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ck or Amy Schumer's put me on her show.</v>

663
00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:11.830
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't always want to be on</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody else's thing.</v>

664
00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:13.120
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

665
00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:16.450
<v Speaker 2>so I love the idea of performing on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>radio.</v>

666
00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:19.900
<v Speaker 2>I love doing it with Opi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love doing it with opie and anthony</v>

667
00:29:19.901 --> 00:29:22.150
<v Speaker 2>more because now let's say the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing of opiod left.</v>

668
00:29:22.150 --> 00:29:26.320
<v Speaker 2>Like I honestly do love being a part of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that radio show.</v>

669
00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:30.400
<v Speaker 2>Being without anthony is difficult and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will be with say the same thing.</v>

670
00:29:30.401 --> 00:29:34.840
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to realize how much space a</v>

671
00:29:34.841 --> 00:29:38.410
<v Speaker 2>person fills in your life until they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>not there.</v>

672
00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:39.311
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

673
00:29:39.311 --> 00:29:41.980
<v Speaker 2>we all know Anthony's a comic gene.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's easy to say,</v>

674
00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:44.830
<v Speaker 2>but it's like the little moments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when there's that chair,</v>

675
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:45.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm close.</v>

676
00:29:45.810 --> 00:29:50.060
<v Speaker 2>I said closer to um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to anthony that I do to you everyday,</v>

677
00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:54.370
<v Speaker 2>five days a week for 10 years and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>was just gone and it's really hard to</v>

678
00:29:54.371 --> 00:29:58.480
<v Speaker 2>get used to that empty seat whether he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying something funny or whether he's</v>

679
00:29:58.481 --> 00:30:02.410
<v Speaker 2>just doing a stupid Iraq joke or a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little aside or just pipe.</v>

680
00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:04.600
<v Speaker 2>It's like this whole fucking vacuum of</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

681
00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:07.330
<v Speaker 2>this great powerful brain that used to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be,</v>

682
00:30:07.331 --> 00:30:08.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a foot away from it.</v>

683
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:10.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or just talking about things.</v>

684
00:30:10.151 --> 00:30:12.790
<v Speaker 2>He's a fascinating guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got a lot of information in his</v>

685
00:30:12.791 --> 00:30:15.370
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He can talk about anything for any</v>

686
00:30:15.371 --> 00:30:17.530
<v Speaker 2>length of time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything he could be.</v>

687
00:30:17.531 --> 00:30:20.260
<v Speaker 2>And we've said that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I've said this before,</v>

688
00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:24.400
<v Speaker 2>Patrice said that anthony can access</v>
<v Speaker 2>funny faster than anybody he'd ever</v>

689
00:30:24.401 --> 00:30:27.670
<v Speaker 2>known.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he just had the ability to access</v>

690
00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:32.500
<v Speaker 2>being funny immediately on any subject.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you talking like,</v>

691
00:30:32.501 --> 00:30:33.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a tin knocker.</v>

692
00:30:33.911 --> 00:30:38.260
<v Speaker 2>He had put in air conditioning vents and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he can walk you through that in a</v>

693
00:30:38.261 --> 00:30:42.550
<v Speaker 2>fascinating way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And be funny about it and be captivating</v>

694
00:30:42.551 --> 00:30:43.810
<v Speaker 2>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me,</v>

695
00:30:43.910 --> 00:30:48.910
<v Speaker 2>I just die telling a story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lose people in me.</v>

696
00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:52.900
<v Speaker 2>It's a joke I've done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I meant the sincerity of it that if</v>

697
00:30:52.901 --> 00:30:56.560
<v Speaker 2>I was on nine slash 11 on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I made it out of the first tower,</v>

698
00:30:56.561 --> 00:30:58.420
<v Speaker 2>I would lose people halfway through the</v>
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>

699
00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:02.770
<v Speaker 2>Like I just have no ability to go from</v>
<v Speaker 2>the beginning to the middle to the end</v>

700
00:31:02.890 --> 00:31:06.670
<v Speaker 2>and keep people locked in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you guys have a meeting with serious</v>

701
00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:07.560
<v Speaker 2>after this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

702
00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:08.260
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>opiates.</v>

703
00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:11.380
<v Speaker 2>We talked to Scott.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talked to Scott on the phone and he</v>

704
00:31:11.381 --> 00:31:11.681
<v Speaker 2>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

705
00:31:11.681 --> 00:31:14.350
<v Speaker 2>we're going to try to move forward with</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and open and see how it happens.</v>

706
00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:16.780
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>worked through it organically on the</v>

707
00:31:16.781 --> 00:31:19.030
<v Speaker 2>air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't tell us how to do it.</v>

708
00:31:19.031 --> 00:31:20.910
<v Speaker 2>They didn't say don't bad mouth the</v>
<v Speaker 2>company don't.</v>

709
00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:23.800
<v Speaker 2>He said worked through it organically on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the air and what we'll see what happens.</v>

710
00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:27.610
<v Speaker 2>So I mean see what happens if they</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely closed the idea of anthony</v>

711
00:31:27.611 --> 00:31:29.170
<v Speaker 2>ever coming back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

712
00:31:29.171 --> 00:31:29.930
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

713
00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:32.800
<v Speaker 2>and they've given me no indication.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm careful how I say that because I</v>

714
00:31:32.801 --> 00:31:36.100
<v Speaker 2>don't want the fans getting like I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>putting false hope out there,</v>

715
00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:41.290
<v Speaker 2>but I'm just being truthful is it</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't feel final to me and maybe</v>

716
00:31:41.291 --> 00:31:46.000
<v Speaker 2>that's my own denial or my own lack of</v>
<v Speaker 2>willingness to admit that this thing</v>

717
00:31:46.001 --> 00:31:46.834
<v Speaker 2>could be over.</v>

718
00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:48.230
<v Speaker 2>Like it was really sad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

719
00:31:48.231 --> 00:31:49.790
<v Speaker 2>I last I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I went to his fucking</v>

720
00:31:49.810 --> 00:31:52.120
<v Speaker 2>fourth of July party and I was very</v>
<v Speaker 2>depressed driving home.</v>

721
00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:55.090
<v Speaker 2>Like I know I'm going to be okay</v>
<v Speaker 2>financially and I know like,</v>

722
00:31:55.091 --> 00:31:56.320
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's other show could take off.</v>

723
00:31:56.321 --> 00:31:57.340
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got stand up.</v>

724
00:31:57.341 --> 00:32:00.160
<v Speaker 2>Hey you got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But just the idea that this thing you</v>

725
00:32:00.161 --> 00:32:03.850
<v Speaker 2>love to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this chapter is closed.</v>

726
00:32:03.910 --> 00:32:08.380
<v Speaker 2>Like just fucking depresses me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Depresses me to listen to it.</v>

727
00:32:08.381 --> 00:32:13.381
<v Speaker 2>I can imagine if it was me every day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>day in day out being a part of it.</v>

728
00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:15.970
<v Speaker 2>Every time I did it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I loved it.</v>

729
00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:18.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean I had a great time doing your</v>
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>

730
00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:20.470
<v Speaker 2>So my favorite radio show of all time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>without a doubt.</v>

731
00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:23.470
<v Speaker 2>It's a real conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have real moments and the laugh</v>

732
00:32:23.471 --> 00:32:27.280
<v Speaker 2>somebody played for me recently are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they sent me a link to Jim Norton's</v>

733
00:32:27.281 --> 00:32:28.240
<v Speaker 2>laugh compilation.</v>

734
00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:31.360
<v Speaker 2>There's just times where people have</v>
<v Speaker 2>made me laugh on the show and I listened</v>

735
00:32:31.361 --> 00:32:34.330
<v Speaker 2>to part one and two because the point is</v>
<v Speaker 2>not me laughing.</v>

736
00:32:34.331 --> 00:32:37.750
<v Speaker 2>It's the things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in most of those laughs I've come</v>

737
00:32:37.751 --> 00:32:41.720
<v Speaker 2>from anthony more than any gas or</v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody and some of the things that he</v>

738
00:32:41.721 --> 00:32:46.190
<v Speaker 2>did a thing recently or years ago that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>heard two days ago where we were talking</v>

739
00:32:46.191 --> 00:32:49.190
<v Speaker 2>about people who have shot themselves in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the head and survived.</v>

740
00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:54.960
<v Speaker 2>And Anthony did the voice of the guy who</v>
<v Speaker 2>survived and he just wanted an</v>

741
00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.270
<v Speaker 2>immediate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He became the guy who had shot himself</v>

742
00:32:59.271 --> 00:33:02.480
<v Speaker 2>in the fucking head in survivors talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about how he just has a more positive</v>

743
00:33:02.481 --> 00:33:07.481
<v Speaker 2>outlook and I'm howling listening to it</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the clip and I'm listening to it.</v>

744
00:33:07.701 --> 00:33:08.180
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

745
00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:09.013
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

746
00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:11.600
<v Speaker 2>two days ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm laughing all over again.</v>

747
00:33:11.601 --> 00:33:13.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forgot that bit ever existed,</v>

748
00:33:13.281 --> 00:33:16.040
<v Speaker 2>but God is cocksucker made me fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>laugh.</v>

749
00:33:16.210 --> 00:33:17.930
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not talking about him like he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>dead.</v>

750
00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:21.200
<v Speaker 2>But I mean that's how valuable a thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>he is.</v>

751
00:33:21.201 --> 00:33:23.330
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't listen to two radio.</v>

752
00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:26.730
<v Speaker 2>They made a big mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they made a bigger stake for</v>

753
00:33:26.731 --> 00:33:26.820
<v Speaker 2>them for a</v>

754
00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:27.780
<v Speaker 1>couple reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

755
00:33:27.781 --> 00:33:31.350
<v Speaker 1>I think they made a big mistake because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's going to open the door more</v>

756
00:33:31.351 --> 00:33:35.280
<v Speaker 1>to the Internet because people are going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to look at that as the only last</v>

757
00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:39.720
<v Speaker 1>remaining true free speech option</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's what it is.</v>

758
00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:40.830
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can.</v>

759
00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:43.770
<v Speaker 1>You could say you don't like this</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>

760
00:33:43.771 --> 00:33:46.010
<v Speaker 1>You can decide that I'm offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do it,</v>

761
00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:48.750
<v Speaker 1>but you can't stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you might,</v>

762
00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:51.480
<v Speaker 1>even though the host might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't want to host you anymore,</v>

763
00:33:51.510 --> 00:33:53.880
<v Speaker 1>I'll find another host.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those sponsors might say,</v>

764
00:33:53.881 --> 00:33:55.140
<v Speaker 1>we don't want to be your sponsor</v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

765
00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:58.960
<v Speaker 1>Well guess what I'll do with no sponsor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We did it with no sponsors for years.</v>

766
00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:04.200
<v Speaker 1>This is the only real option where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're your own producer,</v>

767
00:34:04.201 --> 00:34:05.880
<v Speaker 1>your own director,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your own.</v>

768
00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:08.520
<v Speaker 1>You're the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're the performer.</v>

769
00:34:08.521 --> 00:34:12.270
<v Speaker 1>You're the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where it's sad because just like</v>

770
00:34:12.271 --> 00:34:15.480
<v Speaker 1>a standup is entirely responsible for</v>
<v Speaker 1>your act.</v>

771
00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:18.660
<v Speaker 1>You put on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you had some producer hovering over</v>

772
00:34:18.661 --> 00:34:20.430
<v Speaker 1>your fucking shoulder every time you</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote a bit,</v>

773
00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:22.980
<v Speaker 1>every time you were thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>putting together a set list,</v>

774
00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:25.230
<v Speaker 1>every time you are going up and doing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>

775
00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:28.320
<v Speaker 1>they would review it afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be gross.</v>

776
00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:30.570
<v Speaker 1>That would take all the fun out of being</v>
<v Speaker 1>a comic.</v>

777
00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:31.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be awful.</v>

778
00:34:31.981 --> 00:34:34.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's why I'm a bad collaborator</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're so used to having</v>

779
00:34:34.890 --> 00:34:39.540
<v Speaker 1>absolute and ultimate control of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're a perfect example.</v>

780
00:34:39.630 --> 00:34:43.740
<v Speaker 1>Think about you and you as a successful</v>
<v Speaker 1>performer and personality.</v>

781
00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:48.990
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck would have ever thought you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could have made a mainstream career out</v>

782
00:34:48.991 --> 00:34:53.991
<v Speaker 1>of talking about your love of trannies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about shit and Piss and shit and</v>

783
00:34:54.501 --> 00:34:56.520
<v Speaker 1>in each other's mouths and peeing on</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

784
00:34:56.521 --> 00:34:59.640
<v Speaker 1>Monster rain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just look at the honest things that</v>

785
00:34:59.641 --> 00:35:02.640
<v Speaker 1>you've tackled because you're honest</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're funny.</v>

786
00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:05.460
<v Speaker 1>If you had to vet that through somebody</v>
<v Speaker 1>else,</v>

787
00:35:05.461 --> 00:35:09.960
<v Speaker 1>if you had to have that filter through</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a mainstream producer,</v>

788
00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:13.500
<v Speaker 1>it would've never happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never work.</v>

789
00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:15.210
<v Speaker 1>You're absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

790
00:35:15.211 --> 00:35:18.910
<v Speaker 1>that's why you're right though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Internet is the last place where at</v>

791
00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:21.360
<v Speaker 1>least for now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck knows what happens with</v>

792
00:35:21.361 --> 00:35:22.800
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all that stuff you did,</v>

793
00:35:22.801 --> 00:35:25.050
<v Speaker 1>you did on serious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>serious at a different approach.</v>

794
00:35:25.051 --> 00:35:26.230
<v Speaker 1>When they first came out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they.</v>

795
00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:30.600
<v Speaker 1>They've slowly but surely clamped down</v>
<v Speaker 1>from that Condoleeza Rice incident.</v>

796
00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:32.070
<v Speaker 1>That's where it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

797
00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:35.910
<v Speaker 1>you could get in trouble for something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that someone says on a radio show that</v>

798
00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:38.040
<v Speaker 1>isn't even like</v>

799
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:39.530
<v Speaker 2>a guest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

800
00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:41.520
<v Speaker 2>isn't even one of the hosts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

801
00:35:41.521 --> 00:35:45.030
<v Speaker 2>He was at your show could get canceled,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a homeless guy and they were going to</v>

802
00:35:45.031 --> 00:35:46.930
<v Speaker 2>fire us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That Eric Logan sailor that was accent.</v>

803
00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:48.730
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't sure it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is how.</v>

804
00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:52.350
<v Speaker 2>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fucking the NAB National Association</v>

805
00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:54.690
<v Speaker 2>of broadcasters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody on that side I think was what</v>

806
00:35:54.691 --> 00:35:56.460
<v Speaker 2>was pushing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could the story went on?</v>

807
00:35:56.461 --> 00:35:59.040
<v Speaker 2>Drudge and Breitbart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will this hurt the merger?</v>

808
00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:01.280
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guys who ran the this,</v>

809
00:36:01.290 --> 00:36:04.530
<v Speaker 2>when they're about to merge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will this injure the merger?</v>

810
00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:06.960
<v Speaker 2>And Man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a billion dollars at stake and</v>

811
00:36:06.961 --> 00:36:10.050
<v Speaker 2>then it wasn't going to hurt the merger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they fucking panicked.</v>

812
00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:12.390
<v Speaker 2>And these are all different people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are in charge now.</v>

813
00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:13.380
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're like,</v>

814
00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:14.880
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

815
00:36:14.881 --> 00:36:16.350
<v Speaker 2>and they don't know how to deal with</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

816
00:36:16.351 --> 00:36:19.290
<v Speaker 2>So they get the phone call.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Guy Nate I think was running at the</v>

817
00:36:19.291 --> 00:36:20.220
<v Speaker 2>tower cupid's Arrow.</v>

818
00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:23.670
<v Speaker 2>What do you think of this thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They said a homeless guy said he wants</v>

819
00:36:23.671 --> 00:36:26.430
<v Speaker 2>to rape Condoleezza Rice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like he,</v>

820
00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:31.350
<v Speaker 2>he's worried about a billion dollar</v>
<v Speaker 2>merger and I'm not defending them</v>

821
00:36:31.351 --> 00:36:36.351
<v Speaker 2>suspending us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I try to put myself in there like,</v>

822
00:36:37.010 --> 00:36:38.970
<v Speaker 2>and this is a guy I mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Louis because he's a good,</v>

823
00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:44.030
<v Speaker 2>he's a good nonemotional reactor to</v>
<v Speaker 2>things and he'll look at things and go,</v>

824
00:36:44.491 --> 00:36:47.430
<v Speaker 2>well they're just trying to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like Louis will give you a very</v>

825
00:36:47.431 --> 00:36:50.430
<v Speaker 2>logical reason as to why something's</v>
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>

826
00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:51.541
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

827
00:36:51.541 --> 00:36:54.490
<v Speaker 2>I wish I would've seen that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get too angry and emotional and you're</v>

828
00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:55.111
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck that.</v>

829
00:36:55.111 --> 00:36:56.520
<v Speaker 2>And they're say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I'll go like,</v>

830
00:36:56.521 --> 00:36:58.200
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a billion dollar company.</v>

831
00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:01.710
<v Speaker 2>They're not used to this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they hear this guy wants to fucking</v>

832
00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:06.060
<v Speaker 2>first lady raped Bush or George Bush and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're laughing about merger.</v>

833
00:37:06.061 --> 00:37:07.810
<v Speaker 2>Might be threatened to fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get rid of him.</v>

834
00:37:07.810 --> 00:37:10.770
<v Speaker 2>And he just panics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it fascinating though that you're</v>

835
00:37:10.771 --> 00:37:13.050
<v Speaker 2>talking about a billion dollar company?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

836
00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:16.500
<v Speaker 2>Sirius xm billion dollar company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

837
00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:21.330
<v Speaker 2>What exactly are they selling?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they're selling is content.</v>

838
00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:24.090
<v Speaker 2>Who delivers that content?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guys like opie and Anthony,</v>

839
00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:27.780
<v Speaker 2>guys like Jim Norton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're selling your ability to be</v>

840
00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:29.640
<v Speaker 2>entertaining.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Other than that,</v>

841
00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:32.050
<v Speaker 2>it's just music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How you,</v>

842
00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:34.950
<v Speaker 2>how do you have a billion dollar company</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just selling music?</v>

843
00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:35.970
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

844
00:37:35.970 --> 00:37:38.970
<v Speaker 2>That's where my argument would be to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looked the talk thing is the last,</v>

845
00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:44.460
<v Speaker 2>like the last thing you guys have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is for any evil terrestrial</v>

846
00:37:44.461 --> 00:37:47.610
<v Speaker 2>radio to the last thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have his original talk content and</v>

847
00:37:47.611 --> 00:37:50.490
<v Speaker 2>their point back would be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's a great thing that we have,</v>

848
00:37:50.730 --> 00:37:52.850
<v Speaker 2>but we also have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

849
00:37:53.130 --> 00:37:57.660
<v Speaker 2>whether it's a celebrity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people doing shit or we have sports that</v>

850
00:37:57.661 --> 00:37:59.550
<v Speaker 2>you can't get across.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say we have the MBA,</v>

851
00:37:59.551 --> 00:38:01.620
<v Speaker 2>we have a major league baseball game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying that's what they would</v>

852
00:38:01.621 --> 00:38:02.050
<v Speaker 2>say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

853
00:38:02.050 --> 00:38:03.540
<v Speaker 2>but nobody's paying for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's be honest.</v>

854
00:38:03.541 --> 00:38:05.910
<v Speaker 2>They're paying for stern.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're paying for Opie and Anthony.</v>

855
00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:07.103
<v Speaker 2>I hope so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

856
00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:10.670
<v Speaker 3>Especially since spotify and Pandora,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they used to be.</v>

857
00:38:10.671 --> 00:38:13.850
<v Speaker 3>I like Sirius Radio because they had the</v>
<v Speaker 3>thirties to forties to fifties,</v>

858
00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:15.200
<v Speaker 3>whatever and all the different radio</v>
<v Speaker 3>stations.</v>

859
00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:18.470
<v Speaker 3>Nowadays you just put spotify put</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything you want and as you know.</v>

860
00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:19.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I.</v>

861
00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:23.710
<v Speaker 2>I get almost all my shit from itunes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't ever listen to music in my car</v>

862
00:38:23.711 --> 00:38:25.420
<v Speaker 2>anymore unless it's coming off with my</v>
<v Speaker 2>phone.</v>

863
00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:28.690
<v Speaker 2>I just just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't need to.</v>

864
00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:30.730
<v Speaker 2>You don't need to anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't need them anymore.</v>

865
00:38:30.830 --> 00:38:35.830
<v Speaker 2>And the last thing that's exciting is</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like stern and things like</v>

866
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:40.800
<v Speaker 1>opie and anthony where you can have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy who is just freewheeling,</v>

867
00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:42.940
<v Speaker 1>same whatever he wants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have to worry about language</v>

868
00:38:42.941 --> 00:38:44.740
<v Speaker 1>restrictions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it have to worry about anything?</v>

869
00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.180
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that he can get fired for</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying the same things that he's always</v>

870
00:38:49.181 --> 00:38:53.680
<v Speaker 1>said on his show to saying them in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>text message that they're so ignorant</v>

871
00:38:53.681 --> 00:38:57.160
<v Speaker 1>that they can't recognize that this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're taking it out of context.</v>

872
00:38:57.161 --> 00:38:59.680
<v Speaker 1>You're taking it from a guy who just</v>
<v Speaker 1>recently been assaulted.</v>

873
00:38:59.890 --> 00:39:02.380
<v Speaker 1>You're taking it from a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably had a couple of drinks in him</v>

874
00:39:02.381 --> 00:39:04.990
<v Speaker 1>when he said it and he shouldn't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>done it.</v>

875
00:39:05.110 --> 00:39:07.070
<v Speaker 1>He fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He definitely shouldn't have gone on</v>

876
00:39:07.071 --> 00:39:09.130
<v Speaker 1>that twitter rampage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He should have said it on a video</v>

877
00:39:09.490 --> 00:39:13.570
<v Speaker 2>and you know what podcast or on the show</v>
<v Speaker 2>up on the shelf on the show.</v>

878
00:39:13.571 --> 00:39:16.090
<v Speaker 2>It would have been perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would've been a great episode.</v>

879
00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:17.050
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would been fun.</v>

880
00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:18.640
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Keith Robinson pointed out,</v>

881
00:39:18.641 --> 00:39:22.870
<v Speaker 2>he's like the teasing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could've given him a that teasing</v>

882
00:39:22.871 --> 00:39:25.510
<v Speaker 2>beautiful but it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I don't know if that's something</v>

883
00:39:25.511 --> 00:39:28.210
<v Speaker 2>that will ever change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they may at one point,</v>

884
00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:31.000
<v Speaker 2>we do kind of understand that maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

885
00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:32.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a valuable asset to the like,</v>

886
00:39:32.951 --> 00:39:33.491
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

887
00:39:33.491 --> 00:39:35.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why I don't get that</v>

888
00:39:35.171 --> 00:39:37.600
<v Speaker 2>feeling because they haven't said to me</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll bring him back.</v>

889
00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:40.030
<v Speaker 2>They really haven't and I never want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>give fans.</v>

890
00:39:40.031 --> 00:39:43.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm not trying to keep fans from who it</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally is just a feeling,</v>

891
00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:46.360
<v Speaker 2>a gut feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't drop any bombs.</v>

892
00:39:46.361 --> 00:39:49.960
<v Speaker 2>He didn't go on this and I've talked to</v>
<v Speaker 2>him enough to know what his intent was</v>

893
00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:53.200
<v Speaker 2>and maybe I'm just naive dummy in me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I keep thinking,</v>

894
00:39:53.201 --> 00:39:54.340
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he should come back,</v>

895
00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:57.580
<v Speaker 2>he can come back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just give it some time and I just keep</v>

896
00:39:57.581 --> 00:39:58.650
<v Speaker 2>hoping for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he</v>

897
00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:00.440
<v Speaker 1>can come back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if they gave it some time,</v>

898
00:40:00.441 --> 00:40:03.800
<v Speaker 1>he definitely can come back in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>context of what he said wasn't that bad.</v>

899
00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:07.160
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't have been happy if it was my</v>

900
00:40:07.161 --> 00:40:09.410
<v Speaker 1>company and I had shareholders and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>that jazz,</v>

901
00:40:09.411 --> 00:40:11.960
<v Speaker 1>but I obviously I would never be that</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy anyway.</v>

902
00:40:11.961 --> 00:40:14.960
<v Speaker 1>I would never be a fucking head of a big</v>
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>

903
00:40:14.961 --> 00:40:18.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm just not built for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you got to recognize the</v>

904
00:40:18.561 --> 00:40:21.770
<v Speaker 1>entertainment quality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the entertainment aspect of</v>

905
00:40:21.771 --> 00:40:23.930
<v Speaker 1>that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the entertainment possibilities of</v>

906
00:40:23.931 --> 00:40:25.340
<v Speaker 1>keeping the show together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's his.</v>

907
00:40:25.341 --> 00:40:27.020
<v Speaker 1>Without that all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a stern,</v>

908
00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:29.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously you guys are still together</v>

909
